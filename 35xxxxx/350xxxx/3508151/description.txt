Hack made by a buddy of mine, AlterWH, requested me to help him share via torrent.

It's a wallhack for Counter-Strike Source where you use no "cheat program" it's just a bunch of textures modified so they are transparent, and means it's undetectable.

Alter's Wallhack uses one of the most simplest methods to wallhack, meaning anyone can do it, and it's what makes it undetectable! Download an example of Dust & Dust2 to the left in the menu, or at the bottom.

The purpose of this wallhack is to have as many people as possible knowing about it and/or using it so Valve will be forced to do something about it. It's waaay too easy to wallhack like this.
In theory it should be quite simple to do a hash check on all the "original" content of any file that is loaded for a map.
Why Valve doesn't do this already puzzles me... (Maybe they do, but it's not strict enough!)

There's lots of mappers that know how to set the transparency of any texture for anything in Source so you be sure there's lots of mappers wallhacking. Probably lots of "n00bs" like the ones that makes fy_ maps that do it too.
