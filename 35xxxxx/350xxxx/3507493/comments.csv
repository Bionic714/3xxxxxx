,k4u2000,2006-11-25T09:29Z,"I downloaded this torrent. But when I try to put the episodes on DVD , it transcodes each episodes and each DVD with 3 episodes takes 4 hours to write... Am i doing something wrong? Im using Nero Suite."
,zagor667,2007-10-16T12:52Z,Can somebody please re-seed this?  It's the only season I'm missing.
,Clivetbro1234,2008-06-03T16:05Z,Dear K4u2000. I find that converting the avi files to DVD using AVI converter and the burning them to disc using Ulead Burn now works excelent.  Have done this with Boston Legal and The Wire. Make sure that you use xvid codec. Mine only take 90 mins to convert 5-7 eps
,Actium,2008-06-28T02:25Z,"Episode 3-14 appears to be incomplete.  It is only 35:38, probably missing about seven minutes.  Anyone else have this problem?"
,kenzo69,2008-10-29T01:13Z,"Does anyone know where to find skandinavian or english subs for this series?

Thnks to the uploader for sharing this for all of us that loved Boston Legal and didn't have the chance to watch The Practice."
,kenzo69,2008-10-29T01:18Z,"And where is season 5???

It's the only season not on the tracker..."
,Jinx_Dojo,2009-06-03T06:25Z,"Actium and all: indeed, episode 314 cuts off at 35:38, right in the middle of a scene. If anyone knows another source for this episode, please post it here. The same applies for the source of any English subtitles. Thank you."
,vivatpb5776,2010-10-11T10:34Z,"Appears to be straight from TV rip and full screen. Quality is okay (6/10). Just looking at time points, episode 14 is about four minutes short. I have found no other source. So, until the DVD set comes out (only the first season and the first seven episodes of season two are out), we are stuck with this. I have the entire series and the quality is no better than this."
