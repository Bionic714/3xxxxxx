And the rest...

#81 & #82 & #83 are not too good in my opinion but would probably print OK.

#84 to 86 are very good.

Regarding the others, #39 could be replaced. As could #80. #64 is mising.

An index & synopsis of issues 1 to 82 is here.

And 3 files taken from various issues.

So thats... replace 39, 81, 82 & 83: find 64 - and its complete!

Cheers.
