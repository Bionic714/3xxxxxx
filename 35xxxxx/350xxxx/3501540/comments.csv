,rivotech2,2006-07-08T08:51Z,"I might release a 'Full' version of the Collection.... It stands at about 1,700 mods :) If a few people want it, I might release it... A Full version might be about 8 gigs though..."
,urbanriot,2006-07-09T01:13Z,"Yeow!  Thanks for replying... maybe release just an ""official"" mods package, save people a few bucks?"
,rivotech2,2006-07-09T09:29Z,That I can not do....
,Tossene_Mike,2006-07-12T05:13Z,"Also...I would love it if you would release the ""all full mods release"", rivotech2... =D"
,Tossene_Mike,2006-07-12T05:20Z,"I just saw a mod..well a patch for the Mehrunes Razor plug-in (if you are going to download it) http://www.tessource.net/files/cache/5474.html The Mehrunes Razor makes all the Daedric War Axes bug like crazy...
BTW : sorry for all the posts, and not sticking with the actual ""subject"""

,Crysis69,2008-02-27T13:56Z,If u want mods for oblivion go to Gamespy
,NetherAngel,2008-07-14T00:34Z,"IF you release a full mod pack, try and put it on 2 dvd-iso's if you believe the size gets up to 8 gig's.

Also, maybe you could look at what mod's eat away your fps and what boosts them ^^, not to mention the differences in oblivion mods and SI mods :)

Would be a rather large work ^^''"
,IsoWiha,2009-08-20T12:10Z,"Anyone know is there Oblivion predator mod on torrent?? it would be awesome to get it...
