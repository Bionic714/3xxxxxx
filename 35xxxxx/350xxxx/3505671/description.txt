--Wilhelm Reich, The Mass Psychology of Fascism.

Wilhelm Reich was a psychologist and author who came to the United States in order to escape Fascism and the ravages of the Second World War. The American authorities showed their subsequent appreciation for his work by burning many of Dr Reich's books in 1950s. (Not unlike how the Nazis did twenty years before.) 

He died on November 3rd 1957 in Lewisburgh Penitentiary. In his will, Reich stated that his unpublished papers were to be locked away until the year 2007, 50 years after his death, when as he put it,

"man would be ready for his concepts."
