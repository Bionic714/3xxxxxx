The story takes place 80,000 years ago, likely in Europe during the last major Ice Age. It focuses on a group of Paleolithic humans who travel their dangerous world in search of a flame to rekindle their lost fire. In the era of Quest for Fire, not all people know how to produce it at will. This film demonstrates the difficulty of keeping a fire going under the harsh conditions of the primordial past.
