,killbillme,2006-07-25T05:31Z,This unauthorized version of KILL BILL condenses Vols 1 & 2 and puts it in in chronological order. BONUS! Additional Scenes: See the Massacre of the Shaolin Temple!  Witness the original Pai Mai's 5 Point Exploding Heart Technique! Leaner and meaner with NO HAPPY ENDING! Enjoy.
,Logarythmic,2006-07-25T10:05Z,Is this a joke?
,Woododoll,2006-07-25T10:55Z,"No joke probably, but som nerd has been sitting at home splicing the scences together in a different order. Thus ruining the style of mr. Tarantino.

This just proves that there are people with far to much time on their hands and nothing to do with it."
,Yoshi2047,2006-07-25T16:58Z,"Fan edits are a now well-established tradition, letting people re-interpret works they might love, giving it their own flavor, or giving them a chance to practice their video editing techniques. I guess this cynical bastard ""Woododoll"" has never heard of the Star Wars Phantom Edit? Nothing is ""ruined"" about Mr. Tarantino's work (I'm sure he's a personal friend of yours), as you can obviously still buy (or DL) the originals. If you don't like it, don't download it. Given that you haven't even seen it (seed please!) why critisize it? The only one with too much time on their hands is the one wandering through the Pirate Bay writing idiotic comments on stuff they know nothing about."
,Bolbey,2006-07-25T20:03Z,There is no point to watch the movie like this. It RUINS everything.
,GorkyP,2006-07-26T01:11Z,"""There is no "" Pai Mai's 5 Point Exploding Heart Technique"" PURE bullshit....""

there are no seeders either..."

,Yoshi2047,2006-07-31T00:39Z,"bass0 is obviously also unaware of the fact that Tarantino himself wanted the picture released as a single piece, but was forced by the studio to cut it into two seperate movies, in order to increase revenue. This process also forced him to re-order some scenes, cut others, etc... His masterpiece, as you say, may very well have looked quite different from what was eventually released. Know your facts before shooting your mouth (or your keyboard commands) off."

Enjoy."
,ninahartley,2006-11-25T05:39Z,"I dunno if a fan edit spoils anything, more likely it evens the epic out.

The problem with Kill Bill is, like most people are aware of, that it was to long for the theaters to show. (They would only haul the cash for one pic that evening instead of two)

The money asked Tarantino if it would be possible to cut Kill Bill in the flaming midst wich of course mean more cash all around the table...
Including Mr.Tarantino

Obvious followup was to put all gunpowder in the first pic, forcing a demand for the second half...

Of course when the second half premiered it had  all 100 percent sucky parts left... guess how many percent of goodies that leaved?

In my opinion (with a single p) it is more likely the fan edit comes closer to the directors original intentions.

Of course, somebody might deny this simple thought, but what would the reason be?
Everybody knows this is the way Kill Bill was made from the lable, actors and director himself.

Any reflections?

,killbillme,2006-11-30T05:47Z,"The intention of this fan edit was not to imply that KILL BILL needed fixing. I love both films for different reasons. But the pace of the first one always seemed ""stretched"" and the tone of the second one didnt fit the first one.
Studios can usually tell the length of a film by the script alone. And with a combined budget of #$60 million, you can be sure there were no sudden ""brilliant idea"". They knew all along it'd be 2 movies but it was probably originally written/ conceived as one."
,aikepah,2006-12-01T05:12Z,"People writing reviews in the comments section is IMPORTANT! That's what the comments are for, so people who want to download the file can see what other think about it! I could download it... but I'm not going to because I like the original. I like the way the original is. I dont want to see it put in order... It's not as exciting like that. Most movies are in chronological order... But this movie isn't, that's part of what sets it apart!"
,killbillme,2006-12-05T07:03Z,"That is not a comment, it's your opinion. For you to comment on the torrent. you must download, watch and then comment. What use is your comment if you haven't seen this? That nobody else should downloaded because you don't like the idea? Do you write to every tv show, book, cd, comic, movie you don't like and explain why you don't download that torrent? If you do, stop."
