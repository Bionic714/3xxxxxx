,marko76,2006-07-18T06:35Z,"What's new: ""Comic Life Deluxe"" fonts and some articles.
All the rest is the same as the previous Ultimate Font Collection."
,marko76,2006-07-18T06:35Z,... and the brand new FontDoctor 7.2
,docfrasse,2006-07-24T14:48Z,Tack sĂĽ mycket!
,afonsoduarte,2006-07-31T12:46Z,"font doctor doesn't seem to be working here. any one else with the same problem?
otherwise great font collection."
,Bitbucket23,2006-08-27T16:51Z,"The Bitstream.sit file in this download appears to be corrupted. It stops after unstuffing Chianti, even though there is much more in the file.

Can you re-post this specific file?

And it's not clear which CDs these fonts are from, since there are some missing, especially from the Agfa-Montype collection and the FontShop collections.
"
,marko76,2006-09-01T04:31Z,"To Bitbucket23:

Those are files I just downloaded from the net (using LimeWire). I didn't rip them from original CDs, neither know I anything about them, about their age or even whether they work or not. If you use LimeWire or FrostWire you should be able to find each single collection. Type ""fonts .sit"", ""font .sit"", ""bitstream mac"", ecc. in it and you'll find them as I did two years ago. Sorry i can't help you more than that. Bye."
,marko76,2006-09-01T04:37Z,"Linotype FontExplorerX 1.1 is out:

http://www.macupdate.com/info.php/id/1951(to see what's new)

It's Universal Binary (PPC & Intel), works great with both the latest release of InDesign and XPress and it's free. If you are into typography, go get version 1.1!

,corsairius,2006-09-02T23:35Z,"Do you guys know if the Eplica font is included in the Letraset collection?
Thank you!"
,Bitbucket23,2006-09-03T01:41Z,"No, Eplica is not part of the Letraset collection."
,lwaa,2006-09-06T14:12Z,thanks!!!!
,expatriot1,2006-09-17T09:34Z,Bitstream will not unstuff for me either. I crash in the same places as bitbucket. Thanks for all the work that went into this file.
,Phreak71,2007-02-02T21:01Z,Anyone have the Linotype Congress font set?
,Pizzer,2007-03-11T20:46Z,Thank you.

,dahbigkahuna,2007-03-12T14:59Z,"I downloaded this...and it has a ton of fonts...the only thing was that it somehow changed some of my settings so now when I view certain web pages, it looks like it's written in Russian? I have no idea what it did or how to fix it? It only effected Safari..not Firefox or Opera. Can someone help?"
,Paddle,2007-04-15T02:18Z,"Yes I am thick!!!

I must admit that I do not understand the difference betwen peers, leechers and seeders.

At this moment I am uploading/downloading a torrent - how is it my upload is faster than my download.

Have used Macs for the last 20 years but only in a commercial environment, Quark, Photoshop, Illustrator, Freehand and the (ouch) Pagemaker plus loads of other  s...t. I need some guidance on the web programs - if you have the time please e-mail any tutorials you have on Flash, Dreamweaver and anyother Adbe CS programmes (programs).

,magnifica,2007-11-05T23:06Z,"is Corporate included in the (URW)++  collection? I've been looking EVERYWHERE for it... 

thanks in advance "
,Bomster__,2008-02-19T22:47Z,"Thanks so much.
Few more seeders would be nice."
,CrankyBird,2008-05-16T01:03Z,"Hi,

I'd love it if you could break up this file into the smaller parts ( Bitstream, Emigre, etc.).  

I especially want the FontDoctor 7.2 + SN and Linotype FontExplorerX 1.0.1 without having to download everything.  

Couldn't you make each one a seperate file? 

They aren't available on their own or in any other package.

I still live in the dark ages with a dial up modem so long files are very very difficult to download without getting cut off a zillion times.  

I promise to seed it if you do.

Please, please, pretty please.

Thanks so very much,
Kunga"
,CrankyBird,2008-05-27T03:22Z,"Hi,
I took the advise on using frostwire to find the individual fonts. 

As marko76  said to do.

marko76

 If you use LimeWire or FrostWire you should be able to find each single collection. Type ""fonts .sit"", ""font .sit"", ""bitstream mac"", ecc. in it and you'll find them as I did two years ago. 

Well there are none that are usable.

Thought you'd all like to know.

"
,d-pad,2008-11-04T19:31Z,"thanks for this!

can anyone tell me if the Monotype collection contains the Mosquito font?
...i need it urgently to finish a job, but my boss is to tight to pay the ÂŁ26 :)"
,hildchen,2008-12-04T16:55Z,Thank you very much!
,elistuy,2010-01-09T12:50Z,does this work with windows?
,ethical81,2010-05-20T02:48Z,"This is a great bundle, though I would add the the entire FontFont bundle is out of date by five or more years. It also DOES NOT come with any Hoefler-Jones typefaces.

The applications and other bundles are great; thanks to marko76 for this!  :-)"
,_simis_,2011-05-22T10:16Z,Why just for Mac? Is Didoni or Equalent included?
,captainsmee,2012-02-19T11:53Z,"Your efforts are highly appreciated, thank you for sharing."
