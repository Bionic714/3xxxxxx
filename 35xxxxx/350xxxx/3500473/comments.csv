It's not THAT good, there must be some other reason, what is it you think you are achieving ?"
,brettman,2006-07-03T17:11Z,why would you complain about someone seeding a torrent.. If you dont like it ignore it I for one like the video... I'd bang that bitch
,MnBv98,2006-07-04T14:29Z,"Because people keep seeding the same video over and over, maybe not this guy but for some reason it keeps popping up under different names and I'm just wondering what the fuck is up with that ?

This ""Hannah"" crap is hardly the greatest porn ever, so why seed it every two or three days ?

There are numerous hannah posts under different names, it's just ridicolous."
