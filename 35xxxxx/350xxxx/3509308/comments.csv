,Toy,2006-08-05T12:09Z,"Thank you!
Just one question, what happened to disc 3? Did I miss it?"
,Da King,2006-08-05T14:15Z,Thanks Lord Bender-C! Have a great vacation!
,Son Of Mogh,2006-08-05T18:50Z,"Yeah, happy holidays b-c, you gave us all a good summer, now it's your turn. 

@Toy: disc 3 was skipped, it's not uploaded yet, it was scheduled for later, as you can read about if you go to ds9 s6d4."
,Vidpro007,2006-08-05T19:28Z,"Thanks again.  BTW, S6D3 was suppposed to be out last monday. Is it scheduled for this one instead??? Hope so.  Anyone have a line on Seinfeld S3D3, or Mash S10 (DVD rip)?  Danke."
,Son Of Mogh,2006-08-05T20:17Z,"@vidpro007: maybe s6d3 would have been out last monday. BUT: I don't know if you noticed it but the pirate bay was out for almost a week. So I think it's scheduled for later. Don't worry, we will get it eventually."
,Toy,2006-08-06T12:13Z,"@Son Of Mogh - Thanks for the info.
@bender-c - Thanks for the upload, as usual! Enjoy your vacation!"
