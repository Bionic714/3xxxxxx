,john51uk,2007-03-30T13:48Z,Can anyone tell me how to open this file
,Drunken Munkey,2007-04-01T11:28Z,"Ok, listen up retards. First, download and install WinRAR, then extract the files. MDF files are CD images which must be either mounted using a CD/DVD mounting tool (like Daemon Tools) or burnt to a CD/DVD.

Of course, you would have been able to find this out simply by putting it into Google and looked around for less than 5 minutes. Next time just Google it. Jesus.

Anyway, downloading now, I'll seed for about a week. Thanks for the upload :)"
,beccys4it,2007-04-27T15:23Z,"Works fantastic, Thank you very much.
The serial that ""richhick"" has put here works on this version. it is the full UK European in both pounds and euro.
EXCELLENT THANK YOU."
,Ronnie Ballsweat,2007-05-29T13:14Z,"Ok, so I'm a retard, but I've got 3 rar files. I can't extract them without renaming them. If I do that, how do I join them together to burn to disc?
Sorry for being stupid, but we all gotta start somewhere right?"
,pregunta_todo,2007-08-08T13:52Z,"Okay, for the newbies out there, here's how to install Sage without the unnecessary 'Drunken Munkey' attitude:

1. Download and install Winrar. Get a trial copy from http://www.rarlab.com.

2. Download and install Alcohol 120%. Get a trial copy from http://trial.alcohol-soft.com/en/download_120.php 

3. Using winrar open the first sage archive (Instant_V12.part1.rar), click 'Extract to' and choose a directory. This will automatically extract and recombine the files from all three rar files.

4. Go to the directory to which you saved the files in step 3. You should see 2 files: 'Instant_V12.mdf' and 'Instant_V12.mds' 

5. Open 'Instant_V12.mdf' using Alcohol 120% and burn the file to a cd.

Presto!

You can now install Sage Instant accounts. Use the serial and key supplied by richhick above and your away.

Hope this helps."

Does anyone know where I can get the UK vesion of quickbooks?"
,al2cane,2008-01-24T18:14Z,"Haven't tested it yet, but going on prev comments, it should be good. Will seed for a while.

Thanks for the seed. "
,oculusmm,2008-03-19T12:05Z,"Hard programme to find well done but 1 question. Has any one come across a keygen that will unlock some of the features that require phoning Sage. ie The Transaction EMail addon etc. I live in Hope :-)

,phiner55,2008-04-06T20:06Z,"OK Drunken Munkey, if you wanna help then help, if you wanna be an arrogant arsehole fuck off and do in the privacy of your own cage. To all the others who offer genuine help without need of reward or praise, thanks to all of you, much appreciated."

I had to remove AVAST! completely - reboot and for good measure I disabled Spybot. Installation (i'm on Vista) then completed with no problems.

Hope this helps someone."
