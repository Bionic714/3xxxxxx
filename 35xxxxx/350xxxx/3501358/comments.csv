I have ""Albedo 0.39"" on vinyl and listening to this was like listening to that album only with new stuff thrown in. ""Albedo 0.39"" is available at http://isohunt.com/dl.php?id=12062682 for comparison. By the way, ""Albedo 0.39"" was a better album and among his first efforts when synthesized music was in its infancy."
