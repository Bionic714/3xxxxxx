,j5e1b3h,2006-07-26T00:02Z,How do I extract the bin format?
,hdtom,2006-07-26T12:26Z,how do i mount it? doubleclick opens VLC-video player ...
,cj737271,2006-07-27T01:53Z,"okay for those of you that don't know what to do with the files in the zip, you have two options - you can either mount the bin file or burn it to disc. both of these things can be done using toast (atleast that's what i use). if you have toast, you can just right click on the bin file and then click mount it"
,hdtom,2006-07-27T20:30Z,thank you very much (i tried the diskutility without success first ...)
[T],tmax666,2006-07-28T03:49Z,While this program is great for converting videos to iPod format...it SUCKS for DVD rips.  Toast 7.1 is better.
,lotpot,2006-07-31T06:13Z,Great initiative (shows thumbsup) :)

,omar_asum,2006-08-19T21:15Z,which app open the torrent?
,anniejl,2006-09-01T21:55Z,"Guys, I am new to both Mac and torrents. I have registered myself here. Now what? I clicked ""download this torrent"" and it only read 9.4 KB and then asked for me to pick the application. What step am I missing? Thanks guys."
,anniejl,2006-09-02T20:49Z,"Thanks Maxtor! Now, I'm even having some more difficulties. After I dowloaded it Popcorn2, Stuffit and Dropit Expander apps opened. Can someone please help? Thank you. "
,stef_u,2006-11-23T18:22Z,"Sure, here - i can help you.

Close all the apps and switch off the Mac. Pack it back into its box, take it to the shop you bought it from, give it to them and tell them you are far too damn stupid to own a computer."
,spiralgirl,2006-12-16T21:46Z,"I don't care how basic a question this is, it's the only way I'm going to learn.  So I have the latest toast and Stuffit Expander 11.  How do I open this bin file?  I see the bin 2 that opens into toast.  I'm on a Powerbook so there is no right click and mount it.  Maybe I'll burn it.  I just wanted to mount it to see how it all works.

Also have Popcorn so no worries if I can't get this to work."
,spiralgirl,2006-12-17T06:27Z,Okay I got it to work.  I just clicked the bin 2 cue icon that has the toast icon on it.  Then it was already on Bin/Cue file at left and then I just hit the burn button and burned it.  Then it opened and I was able to transfer to the apps file.

people like you should be kicked out of PB
and never be allowed to return. it's very easy to make wise ass comments when you're a cunt!

Did you forget whats it's like to be a newbie?
The whole point of this forum/comments section is to help each other out.

if you cant help shut the fuck up!!!

Merry fuckin Christmas!

,mac_davis,2007-01-23T04:17Z,"If anybody has the same confusion as annie, then here:

That's good! That means you can extract the file. So drag the zip file onto the program, and open the resulting folder!"
,kkc620,2007-02-27T09:12Z,downloaded popcorn 2 but do not have osx 10.4 or higher...anyone know where i can find the appropriate torrent for 10.4? thanks.
