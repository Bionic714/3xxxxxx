DON'T LET THE GUITARS CONFUSE YOU."
,sotiricon,2007-01-02T12:00Z,"...maybe MACHINE HEAD,TYPE O NEGATIVE & METALLICA are little bit closer but  i mean DEPECHE MODE & NEW ORDER have more rock feeling than all of these bands even that they sound ''pop''. you should think over the title you gave to this compilation. where is slayer, zeppelin, doors, motorhead, ac\dc and so many others? oh what the fuck i'm talkin about,fuck it!!!"
,twshadow101,2007-01-05T18:31Z,"Will somebody for the love of God please fucking seed. Why download a torrent and not share it? You want people to share so you can get what you fucking want, but when it comes down to sharing for others none of you fucking do it. SEED THIS DAMN TORRENT!"

,n1ce_hat,2008-06-01T21:00Z,"This torrent should have used a cleanup. 

Lots of ID3 tags are messed up, mis-spelled, missing.  Overall I thought it was very messy and you look like you are uploading this to be some sort of must-own definitive library, yet when you load the files into winamp it looks like it was organized by a 10 year old using napster. 

That said, the files themselves were neatly tucked away in folders and I had no problem with the music itself.

Thank you for the upload, it had a lot of music I was looking for.

Cheers."
,eerrbb256,2008-06-03T03:19Z,"good s**t, seed people!, this is the second time i have to download this, my hard drive fried so im redownloading this, the first time i downloaded it, it took 3 weeks..."
