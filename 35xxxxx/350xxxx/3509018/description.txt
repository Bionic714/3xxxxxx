7/31/06 Update:

Pretty big update, not so much in diversified content as additional albums. If this torrent gets any bigger, I'll probably split it up.

+ Linkin Park - discog
+ System of a Down - discog

>Rammstein - cleaned up duplicates
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the third out of four torrents I'll be uploading cataloging my library of music. This covers industrial metal, heavy metal, and plain ol' rock. As always, albums I authentically own will be 256 kb/s. 

Remember: you don't have to wait for all 13 gb to finish to start listening to music. Once a file has reached 100% you can open it just as you would with any other mp3. 

Tip: you may prioritze which files you want first by changing the bandwidth priority to high. 

Tip: if you use utorrent or bitcomet, you can select which files to download before the torrent even starts downloading. If you prefer to "cherry pick", deselect all files and go through them at your leisure. If you choose this method, reserve about half an hour to go through all the files for the ones you want.
