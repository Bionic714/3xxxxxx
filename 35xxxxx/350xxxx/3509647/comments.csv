FYI: the high rating on imdb is probably due to the very one-sided portrayal of the cuban revolution by Andy Garcia. As a film it's not very good or entertaining at all."
,galtazar,2006-08-08T16:38Z,Tackar!!
,onurene,2006-09-18T01:33Z,"thx for all the great release Axxo,

,spartan777,2007-06-06T02:38Z,"oh please, this is probably the most accurate account of the Guevera. It lacks any of the romanticized garbage most would put in. The truth is that Guevera killed people in cold blood, no trial, no defenses. This is a great movie. 


Also, imdb now has the movie listed as having come out in 2005, and it has a ration of 6.9"
,Johnpetersn,2008-08-23T19:22Z,Thanx. It's a good one this.
,craziiichica,2009-01-21T16:30Z,"this movie's great,thnx!!!"
,Demonicflair,2011-04-27T07:27Z,All the people talking about the release date are fucking retarded. He gave you the damn movie. Stop buggering. It was released in 2006 in canada.
