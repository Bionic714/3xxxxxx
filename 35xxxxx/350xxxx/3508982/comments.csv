,martysgyro,2006-11-18T02:56Z,"Betty O. I use piratebay and after for the download bitcomet. I have this movie now and great quality as ussual from""AxxO"". So your either not using the right download site, or install codecs, as ""Axxo"" always nicely explains. If that does not work, maybe you should buy a new compu!!!!! The movie is kinda douchbag titanic story, or speed 2. I fell asleep with it, but good for the collection to have. Caribbean greetings"
,rhodes,2006-12-03T11:24Z,"Allvarligt. Den här filmen är HELT värdelös. Totalt slöseri med tid att glo på den.

Seriously. This film it TOTALLY worthless. Complete waste of time to watch it."
,Jacky_D,2006-12-25T12:25Z,so fucking great! I belive both poseidon and axxo need more credit! awsome
,redhead84,2006-12-31T10:24Z,"I dunno if this means anything to anyone else, but i just received an email saying that two of the torrents i downloaded from this site, (jackass 2 and barnyard, both from aXXo) 

were traced back to my ip address. Should i be worried? I also just subscribed to a group thing that i am pretty sure aXXo is affiliated with.

As is appears, aXXo is done. We will no longer be posting movies, and 

will rarely, if ever, visit this page. Sorry everyone. But who knows... 

we may put a movie up once in a while, or we may return. 


Thanks for all your support,

So, does anyone have a take on this? Did some big shit go down? Has anyone else gotten one of these? I dunno what to think. Please reply. I love all of aXXo's releases, i hate to think that i cant download them anymore cuz ""the man"" is watching. 


HELP!?!
