,WinnieXL,2007-01-15T20:00Z,"?	For better performace and correct airport mesh, a setting in FS2004 configuration file should be changed. Without this change airport mesh will be wrong.

First find and make a backup copy of the original file FS9.cfg. This file is usually situated in hidden folder: ""Documents and Settings - Application Data - Microsoft - FS9"" 
?	Edit FS9.cfg with Notepad and find the setting: 
?	TERRAIN_MAX_VERTEX_LEVEL"" (usually found at line 139). 
?	Replace the original number with the number 21. 
?	It should then look line this: TERRAIN_MAX_VERTEX_LEVEL=21 
?	Save the file. Start FS2004 and enjoy"
