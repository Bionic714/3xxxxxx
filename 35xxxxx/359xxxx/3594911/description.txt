A Left Hand Like God - A Study Of Boogie-Woogie - Peter Silvester


aka 'A Left Hand Like God - A History Of Boogie-Woogie Piano'


Boogie Woogie - this exhilarating, noisy offspring of American blues music was first played by black American pianists in barrelhouses and joints serving as places of entertainment for the black labour force working in the lumber and railway construction industries of the Deep South.

The start of USA-wide interest and international recognition was the performances of the Big Three (Meade Lux Lewis, Pete Johnson and Albert Ammons) at Carnegie Hall in the late 1930s, and hence the piano style moved from the ghetto to the Cafe Society nightclubs of New York.

The book consists of 324 pages that chronicle the early pioneers of boogie woogie through to players who carry on the tradition. It covers just about everything you need to know about the players, their history and style of playing. A short discography, an index, black and white photographs and line drawings of posters and labels are included. Published in 1988. 

'A Left Hand Like God' by Peter Silvester, is a very well written and researched look at the history of how and where boogie woogie piano developed.

This rare and out-of-print book is a must-have for fans of boogie woogie and the best book there is for anyone interested in boogie woogie, e.g. teachers and students.
