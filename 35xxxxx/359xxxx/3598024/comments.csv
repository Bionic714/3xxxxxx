Mad props to you for uploading such a gem!"
,Straticus,2007-01-23T09:32Z,"right on! I'm really glad you enjoyed it...this truly is a well kept secret of a film, and it took me forever to find it on DvD (believe that) so that I could share it with the world! Look for more cult-like bizarre stuff coming tonight!
