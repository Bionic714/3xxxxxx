,Hagar,2007-01-11T19:16Z,":o) Äntligen! Ingen ISO, ingen img, ingen rar. bara mappen med filerna, för det är filerna man vill ha, inte en massa upp-packande hit och dit. 

:-( Men, man ska naturligtvis tala om vad det är för film. "
,dougdstewart,2007-01-11T19:21Z,"VIDEO_TS is my favourite movie! You could have at least put the name of the movie on the description, since you seem to have no idea how to put it in the title."
[V],Hector_Lavoe,2007-01-11T19:48Z,"Well if we follow the imdb-link we cal all see that the movie is: ""Desperate Living"" from 1977. I quote from imdb: "" A rich housewife enlists her maid's help to murder her husband; they go on the lam and end up in Mortville, a homeless community built into a garbage dump""

Come on guys be nice... =) I don´t see any of YOU uploading anything..."
,saamo,2007-01-11T19:56Z,Right you are. People whine to much. I have to agree with Hagar and hail the fact that you haven´t compressed anything. Me like!
,MethodLoser,2007-01-11T20:51Z,"Seriously, goddamn, lay off because he made a mistake. You people would piss me off if this were one of my threads."
