Another of John Waters' outrageous films, but this time, without his main star, Divine. This is the only film of his pre-main stream films in which Divine does not appear. This film needs to be seen to be believed, and if you are a fan of hard core indie outrageous cult films, this is a MUST SEE. This is a direct rip frm DvD

And as always, when you've gotten the download, PLEASE SEED!

Enjoy!
