,Massmordaren,2007-01-14T14:46Z,"Wonderful, I love installers!
And, of course, I love Budapest. Never been there, though, but I love anything that has to do with Hungary, the home land of Franz Liszt..."
,4X-AXG,2007-01-14T15:05Z,"the update installer searches for the following directory:

FS2004\Aerosoft\Budapest 2007\Budapest_City
FS2004\Aerosoft\Budapest 2007\Budapest_LHBP

so make sure you got those and this should work"
,N537JB,2007-01-14T15:14Z,"Hey, sorry for that, I know what the problem is.

In the Aerosoft folder is there a 'Budapest 2007' folder.. Re-name that folder to 'Budapest'. Now it should work, oh and btw, xaver_Cox, now that you changed the Budapest 2007 folder, please let the 'Budapest_LHBP' folder has it name like that, so just re-name the folder back again to 'Budapest_LHBP' :-)

Sorry for that guys."

[T],stevekasian,2007-01-14T17:32Z,"Just out of curiosity, why? Aerosoft didn't make their own updater work properly?"
,N537JB,2007-01-14T17:37Z,"No problems ;-)

@SK, no idea, I would suppose that it's a bug or something..."
,yo7,2007-01-14T17:42Z,"req: simcharts for FSX!

http://www.jeppesen.com/wlcs/application/commercewf?origin=category.jsp&event=link(browse)&wlcs_catalog_sourceKey=wlcs_categories&wlcs_catalog_destinationKey=wlcs_siblings&wlcs_catalog_category_id=AT1E

it's better!

thanks for your upload "
,BritneysOrifice,2007-01-14T19:47Z,yo7: Very little likelihood of getting SimCharts for FSX as it is now a web-based subscription app. Read the information carefully. Purchase of the SimCharts package gives you access for a year so you'll need to have someone's subscription codes to get it to work. Just FYI.
