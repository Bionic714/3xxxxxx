,Massmordaren,2007-01-06T17:32Z,"4X,

I just found Real Germany 3 on eMule. The speed is quite lousy, so it should take a week or so to get the whole thing..."
,BritneysOrifice,2007-01-06T18:15Z,"Scalar07: true, this has been out for a while, but it's an extremely hard one to find.  This one's much appreciated. **Massmordaren: RG3 is an impossible one to get. If you've found it and can get it, that would be great."

,Dr. Frikadel,2007-01-07T10:09Z,"Forgot..:) REQ: XP-Simulation Montpellier 2005

XP-Simulation has stopped making FS scenery and removed all products from the market, so it's not obtainable anymore, which is shame because it's great french photoreal scenery, nicely made airports. I have Chambery, which fit's fine with the alpes south scenery from FranceVFR.  
But I'm looking for Montpellier 2005, which is also a stunner. 
Any takers?

Dr. Frikadel"
[T],stevekasian,2007-01-07T12:02Z,"Dr Frikadel:  Here you go - I'm re-seeding it for ya... lol - You keep requesting the sceneries I have! And I never have the shit people request - funny.

Enjoy,

,Dr. Frikadel,2007-01-07T14:51Z,"Much obliged Sir Steve. Downloading as we speak..:)

Mmm...now i'm tempted, do you have that other package from XP-Simulation: regional airports?

Dr. Frikadel"
,Dr. Frikadel,2007-01-07T15:01Z,"And to stay in line with the topic
REQ: Scenery Germany 1 and GAP1 FS2004

Dr. Frikadel"
[T],stevekasian,2007-01-07T17:45Z,"Good Dr.:   ...Son of a BITCH!  No, I don't. Bummer. I was on a roll there too. lol - These are the only 2 XP Simulation titles I have. They're not out of business, btw... their website is still up.

I do, however, have Aerosoft SG1 and GAP1 for FS2004. Both are installers. SG1 is an .mdf image set with serial. GAP1 is an .exe

GAP1 is here: http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3589875/FS2004_-_Aerosoft_German_Airports_1

SG1 I'll have to upload later on. Gotta sleep. ;-)

Hoy matee!!
SK"
[T],stevekasian,2007-01-07T17:48Z,"You just DL'd GAP1 the other day there, Dr. Frik...  'You been takin some-a them thar pills you prescribe to your patients? lol"
,Dr. Frikadel,2007-01-07T18:22Z,"HAHAHaha LOL you're right indeed, i'm getting nutty here..:) In installed them but did not add them to the library...oohhh stupid!
But SG1 is still a winner I NEED to have ;)

Thanks all guys, much appreciated,
Dr. Frikadel"
,Dr. Frikadel,2007-01-07T20:37Z,"""They're not out of business"", I didn't say that, the're out of the FS development business. Now they design for professional sim companies. And I have a hunch they will sell there FS stuff to FranceVFR because of the snug fit into the photoreal Alpes stuff...;)

Danke!
Dr. Frikadel"
[T],stevekasian,2007-01-08T02:14Z,"My bad - but you did say ""...removed all products from the market, so it's not obtainable anymore"", so I wanted to let ea'one know they can still go to their website and buy it. You know... since everyone here is so interested in paying for software ;-)"
[T],stevekasian,2007-01-08T03:18Z,SG1 is posted. :-) You'll wanna give it some time tho cuz I'm utilizing lots of upstream bandwidth for other thingz at the moment.
,Dr. Frikadel,2007-01-08T09:59Z,"Nope, just went there and no buy button  at www.xp-simulations.com, nor simmarket.com :)

Dr. Frikadel"
[T],stevekasian,2007-01-08T11:26Z,"aaaaah... I see. So the dumbasses keep the info posted for people to druel over, but don't let them pay for it. lol - That's a great way to thwart piracy!  hahahahaha"
,Dr. Frikadel,2007-01-08T11:34Z,"mmm...piracy, yeah but somebody first have to buy it...grrr....:(

But how about SG3? Is that somewere around or Berlin VFR?

Many many thanks!
Dr. Frikadel"
[T],stevekasian,2007-01-08T12:40Z,"Oh, they're around....    lol
I'll get 'em up sometime this week if I have time."
,Dr. Frikadel,2007-01-08T13:03Z,"Darn that would be nice! Much appreciated. Do you need something that you don't have? FS-wise I mean, anything else use your right hand please LOL :)

[T],stevekasian,2007-01-08T18:01Z,"Use my right hand??  mmmmkay... We're gonna pretend u didn't type that and move on, cuz I don't even wanna know what you meant. lol
