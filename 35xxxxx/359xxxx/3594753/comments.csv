http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3542624/FS2004_-_Flight_Simulator_2004_ISO_-_Full_Game_-_Repack_By_108

If you duplicate torrents, you split the traffic and make it slower for everyone. Use the search function and you'll know when something's already being DL'd.

[T],stevekasian,2007-01-12T18:28Z,(Disregard the peer report on that page as it is wrong - there are now at least 16 leeches and 7 seeds connected)
,mikeclot,2007-01-12T18:48Z,if you search for it you could not find it and it was askd for so thats wy i uppload it
[T],stevekasian,2007-01-12T19:19Z,Look at around the 9th item down and you'll see it: http://thepiratebay.org/search.php?q=Flight+Simulator+2004
,baabis,2007-01-12T22:27Z,"SK, are you sure this is the one you're talking about? Look at the size..there are some differences..."
[T],stevekasian,2007-01-12T23:56Z,"I uploaded it - Mine's bigger, I don't know what that means exactly... except that there's obviously ""more stuff"" in mine. lol (just kidding)
It's just been goin strong since October, so there's really no reason to send peeps off in different directions for the same thing, u know?
I do know that there's no ""SafeDisc"" protection on mine, if that means anything. Maybe this one's not burnable cuz-a that? I dunno. But whatever..."
[T],stevekasian,2007-01-12T23:59Z,"...If everyone just goes ahead and posts anything and everything that's requested without first searching [properly] to see if it's already here and being seeded, it just fucks up the efficiency of all these torrents here, that's all."
,belga1,2007-01-13T02:02Z,"The ""SEARCH"" tab is the less used tab
The ""REQUEST"" word is the most used word
ROFL
And it's apply for many things on the net...  :)
Pppl's are like that.....
Thank you Stevekasian...tot ry to correct them  :)"

,gfhunter,2008-02-24T09:41Z,"i solve the problem with // inset disc 4
Do like this.
1. Go to that location you extract it to.
2. click on the fs9 file and copy it.
3. Go to that location you installed your game and put the fs9 file into GAME folder.
4. Then try to run the game// (the fs9 file is the crack)"
