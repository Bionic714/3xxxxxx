,deathbert,2007-03-19T20:33Z,are part 2 and 3 available?
,Cat2953,2007-09-08T21:13Z,Good question; what about parts 2 & 3? 
,kebhen,2008-02-11T14:20Z,This actually follows disk 1 & 2 of the Power 90 series. Of which you can get disk 1 here and disk 2 at btmon.com. But if you complete these three disks you might as well go to the p90x. Which is Tony's next harder work out series. You can get the whole series and books here @ piratebay.
,PrinceBuddha,2008-03-04T15:50Z,"Power 90 Master Series is a standalone fitness program!
It includes these workouts:
Core Cardio
Plyo Legs
Sculpt 5/6 (INCLUDED IN THIS TORRENT)
Sweat 5/6 (INCLUDED IN THIS TORRENT)
Cardio Intervals
Upper Middle Lower

so the Power 90 Disc 1 & 2 aren't the ""lost"" parts of this torrent!!!

Yes it follows Power 90 but its not a part of it!

I think the uploader wanted to make 2 workouts in one part (torrent).
I couldnt find part 2 and 3 anywhere so i think he didn't upload it.
What a pity :("
,prgwte,2008-10-01T12:16Z,"thank you 4 an awesome torrent! This goes to Prince Buddha or anyone interested. Im currently dloading P90 Master Series. Will consider uploading if enough ppl show interest. will check back periodically if people show interest.
I will only be able to initiate seed for 1:1 ratio, so ppl will have to cooperate and seed. Again please post comment if interested in having the missing P90 Master Series files uploaded."
,mrjhov79,2008-10-11T18:04Z,"1st off I'd like to thank all who upload, I'd do the same when possible but I guess I'm a boob about somethings cause I cant figure out how. prgwte I'd be interested in the complete download of the Master Series or at least the missing parts. As always I'd seed like crazy."
,snowman5000,2008-10-21T08:20Z,i downloaded the rest of the parts from demonoid when i finish seeding 1:1 i might upload them here
,wintersidhe,2009-01-21T00:54Z,"You can download the other parts of this series from torrenreactor.  It's just the Demonoid ones snowman5000 was talking about, but with this one you don't need no stinkin' password."
