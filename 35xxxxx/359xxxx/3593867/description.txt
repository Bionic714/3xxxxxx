This is some pictures that I downloaded off Usenet a couple of years ago....thought I'd share them with you.

It contains pictures scanned and uploaded to Usenet's alt.binaries.pictures.playboy.verified  (or something like that).  It contains centerfolds, datasheets, cartoons, some scanned in articals and such.  I also appear to have put some pictures from "Easyrider" magazine in there sometime or another.

Please seed this I don't know how long I"ll be able to keep it up....

thank you for your time;
