After seeing devastating results of ethnic war in former Yugoslavia soldiers from UNPROFOR peace units find it impossible to return back to their civil lives in the UK.

Brilliant BBC drama well worth watching (those who where affected by the conflict in Yugoslavia should probably stay away though).

Slow upload so please be patient.
