it took me a whole day to download this game n it turned out to be pure undoped CRAP!the install wouldn't execute...USELESS!

Hmm, U got ware winxp?? If so, u might have that same crappy version i had.. It had bug with windows installer, on some games, the installer wont start, or it seems like it, but if u look at task manager, u can see processes running & folder showing up where u setted it to install.. So it works that far, until click next to install, & then it disappears & but still running on processes, so if thats prob, just wait till msiexec.exe disappears from processes.."
,69RocketGC,2007-02-28T03:50Z,Dont extract just burn .iso file to disc using nero!!  I assure you this is a perfect working copy.

,RavanaMaster,2007-12-30T05:15Z,"To all those who can't click on any icons:

I remember playing this game when I was 8, you need to have the CD in the drive to play.  If you use a virtual drive, make sure that the image is mounted and the virtual drive letter is the same as it was when you installed.

This torrent worked perfectly for me."

[T],AXG,2009-02-09T05:12Z,"100% love you RocketGC,

This game is like... My first ever FPS I bought, and it came to mind when I took the box from out of the dusty attic, to find out no CD :(

So I had to download it for old times sake. And it worked without problem. The 2 other seriels didn't work, but the first one did. I also went online to Novaworld and got connected. Aww, the old online laggy-ness of this game. I miss it :D

-Seriel: JNMG-NPKH-4892-CVL3-S3SS
-Multiplayer: Yes, you need to goto novalogic.com to download the update patch.

Thanks,

,Mikroaalto,2009-06-21T00:42Z,"I burned this to CD-DVD, and when I tried to install this. It reported an error:

""16-bit Windows-lowersystem""
NT specious DOS-Machine encountered illegal operation.
CS:8e00 IP:28bf OP:28 00 8e 07 32""
And then it gives the choise of either closing it, or skipping it. Clicking the ""skip"" just throws similiar error message.

Same thing with Delta Force 1. What the fuck is this crap?"

,D3Studios,2010-06-30T23:21Z,"Obviously, you guys are mentally retarded so I'll draw it out in fucking crayon.

#1. Mount ISO using Daemon Tools, use your brain and read the documentation that comes with that program so you can use it.

#2. Install game using the serials from this comment page, they work.

#3. Go to www.dfbarracks.com and get the No-CD patch from their DF2 section of the site. Follow individual instructions per crack, since they have two. 

#4. Before running game, make it XP Compatible if you're using Vista or 7. 

#5. An hero if don't understand what the fuck I just said."
