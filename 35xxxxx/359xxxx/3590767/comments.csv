,karl500,2007-02-15T09:03Z,"How do you open a .7z file?

You need 7-zip: http://www.7-zip.org/

7-Zip is a freeware.

I use the 7-Zip format (.7z) because it offers stronger compression than Zip. "
,camper182,2007-02-20T19:57Z,OR WINRAR can open it.
,karl500,2007-02-23T16:57Z,"This is a No-DVD crack.
After installing the game just replace the .exe file with this one.
THIS IS THE CRACK ONLY WHICH ALLOWS YOU TO PLAY A copied Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Vegas PC DVD-ROM.
YOU MUST OWN A copied Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Vegas PC DVD-ROM AT FIRST."
