,Domnic,2009-11-20T19:15Z,"Movies do NOT teach anything!  They are meant to be fantasy and therefore are full of lies. 

There is one sure thing; however, women tend to follow fashion and the ones that REALLY FOLLOW IT HARD are evil.  Why?  EASY!  They fall in love with themselves, so they can NOT possibly love anyone else. "
,Domnic,2009-11-20T19:18Z,"Oh, one more thing.  This movie IS STUPID.  It does NOT TEACH what is meant by ""The devil wears prada"".  I taught it in my just previous post if the reader didn't know already. "
