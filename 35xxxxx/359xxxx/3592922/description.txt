The Truth and Lies About 9-11:
-----------------------------

Michael Ruppert is a former narcotics officer for the L.A. Police Department who discovered CIA drug trafficking in 1977 and who was fired when he tried to expose it. Since then he has been the publisher of From the Wilderness, a newsletter dedicated to exposing corruption in government. This is a video of a presentation he made at Portland State University on Nov. 28, 2001. It has been updated with commentary by numerous experts, including Congressmen, Professors, and a former Wall Street investment banker, all of whom confirm his thesis, which is that the war on terrorism and the war on drugs are not what they appear to be. He produces documents proving that the real objectives are to subsidize a stock market boom, gain control over oil resources in the Middle East, and establish U.S. global dominance on the road to world government. The recording suffers from not being professionally produced, but the message is there; and what a message it is.
