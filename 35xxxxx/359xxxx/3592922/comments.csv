,imizrahi,2007-01-10T16:16Z,"ikobescak...
let me explain how it works...
the 'conspiracy nuts' are, supposedly, uncovering what the govt plans or are doing...
not the other way around...
i remember all the crazies that thought there was more than one assassin that killed kennedy.

in case you don't understand this, it's facetious.
sarcasm.
how could kennedy have an exit wound in the back of his head when he was supposed to've been shot from behind...
if these conspiracies are too hard for you to accept, maybe it's b/c the truth would be too hard to handle/take responsibility for...
americans don't want to give up their comfortable lives.  even though they KNOW they've been lied to, time and again, by the bushes.
bush never won an election.  it was so obvious that this was true AND repressed that other 'conspiracy theories' become a little bit more believable...
but most people just stand around and watch in horror while someone is being mugged, robbed, beaten.  right?
i'm not blaming them.  we all have to live with the consequences of our inactions...just like the germans who hated nazism but never did anything.  
and then it was too late...
you REALLY believe that with all the technology and money(remember?  sr bush was head of the c.i.a.)available to these people, with their control over the media, that some of what's being proposed here might not be true?

all i'm saying is keep an open mind.
unless that scares you like it does most people."
