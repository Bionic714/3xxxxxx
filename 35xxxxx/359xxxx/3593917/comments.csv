,TvrtkoThe1st,2008-02-14T22:48Z,"Someone SEED, please......?? 
I'll do the same, later. I swear. 
I'm stuck on 72% :("
,TvrtkoThe1st,2008-03-02T15:47Z,"Well...I dL it, so... 
It's working on FSX but badly. 
Some buildings are black, statue of liberty is 
misplaced, etc... 
But, since there's no better, I still use it !!! 
It's better then without him, trust me - I have 
many, many shots before and after! ;) 
Still, if you can wait, they'll redone it for FSX, 
but I hear the work is slow 'coz of difficulties 
to do it right way in FSC code ! 
Choice is on you... "
