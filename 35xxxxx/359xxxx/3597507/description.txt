This is the FULL Apple iPhone video presentation done by Apple CEO Steve Jobs at the Macworld 2007. His full keynote speech was almost two hours long; this is only the part about iPhone (1 hour 19 minutes long). It's been encoded in divx/mp3 format.

Please seed it, the file is 120MB and my connection is not too great :)
