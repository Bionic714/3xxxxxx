
ICE CUBE  Kill At Will (1990)
-----------------------------

A seven-track postscript to AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted (built around a remix of that album's "Endangered Species," with a blistering new verse by Chuck D.), and a booming car tape for short drives, this is why people thought gangsta rap was a good idea at the time. It's got a certain amount of filler and goofiness (like "Jackin' For Beats," with Cube kicking it over a bunch of famous grooves), but it's also got some great quick-cut music from Sir Jinx and the Bomb Squad, and two of the darkest, toughest, truest tracks Cube's ever done: "The Product," a scathing indictment of the system that destroys America's underclass, and "Dead Homies," a clear-eyed look at the aftermath of violence.
