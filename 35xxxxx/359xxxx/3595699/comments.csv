,VillMann,2008-12-19T21:44Z,"Anyone know how to convert the filenames with non readable letters on non russian os? The closest codepage match i've found is the old russian dos codepage cp866, the text is readable although scrambled with box-drawing characters. Filenames in newer russian codepage show fine."

""shvituris"" is right)
It;s music global fucking )
""SHANSON"" it's for depressive people.
Someone say: ""It's music about hard live""
I do not think so)
It's simple bad music
Listen possitive musik, but no song about prisoners in the Russian prisons
And about a life of Gangsters"
