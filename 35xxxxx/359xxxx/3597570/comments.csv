,vosgienne,2007-01-17T20:20Z,No trojans or viruses that I can find. Makes a bootable floppy so that it is most useful for diagnostics on any PC regardless of Operating System.
,BigGuy43,2007-01-17T22:17Z,"Actually, its direct from the manufacturers disk, so, no ,there are no virii,trojans etc"
,bowlerxxx,2007-01-18T06:44Z,Do you have anyother products from micro 2000 such as the usb scope or the microscope on a stick? Microscope seems to be a small file.  I had the original cd from them i just didnt pay the $150 for the updates they told me were free for life.  Salesman will tell you anything for a $1 but luckly we have tpb
,BigGuy43,2007-01-18T07:41Z,"No, I dont sorry, but im looking for them. The one thats in this torrent is the floppy version 12L with the free update patch, downloaded from their site that upgrades it to the latest, 12R. The patch, according to them, only works on the L & M versions."
,bowlerxxx,2007-01-18T08:50Z,it sucks you only have the floppy version and not the cd version.  Can you get the updates to the cd version?? thanks for replying and posting this software for us to try
,BigGuy43,2007-01-18T09:02Z,"It seems not, but im still looking. I presume youve tried looking at the Micro2000 homepage  download section? I cant find anything for the CD version on there. Is the CD version much different to the floppy one? IE can you not copy the floppy files onto a CD and run it?"
,evilstoat,2007-02-04T23:47Z,the dl speed sux is it all narrowband users dl or something?
,44gambit44,2008-04-02T18:12Z,"ok, well why the hell is it so small? "
