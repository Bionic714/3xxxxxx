,kris018,2007-01-11T05:30Z,"alittle question to you all.

been away from FS for so long but i remember i could never find any good tree addons, be it freeware or payware, is there anything out there for this?

thx in advance"
,Mr Silver,2007-01-11T08:32Z,Thnx for the up. You could try Gerrish Grey Trees_v3.zip free and generally considered the best tree library. Don't know where now!
,allen_x,2007-01-11T09:37Z,"thank you, i love hawaii, especially honolulu, but who doesn't right ?"
,kris018,2007-01-11T12:27Z,"Got to stop seeding a few hours, ill start again tonight"
,neslesman,2007-01-11T17:02Z,"anyone else having problems with the installer hanging and freezing.  Three tries and I give up.  Too bad, I'm sure it's the original FSG install file but I can't go to them for support.

Hope the rest of you have better luck cuz this mesh should look real good in hawaii.  Thanks for the upload kris, I know the hanging install isn't your fault."
,allen_x,2007-01-11T17:07Z,"working fine here, sorry to hear that matey"
,zkalos,2007-01-11T17:44Z,"THX

REQ.: PSS Concorde with last patch (concorde_update_11.exe) or only the cracked patch.PLEEEEEES!!! The orig patch not working only with the legal cd in drive!"
,neslesman,2007-01-11T17:46Z,"Thanks allenx I thought that might be the case.  I tried one more time with absolutely everything shut down but it still froze and then the installer shut itself down with an error message.  Too bad, I guess I better go check out Hawaii now to see if all is well."
,pilgrim37,2007-01-11T18:18Z,"Works fine for me! just leave it run....it searches for files which need to be removed so you don't get duplicate coastlines.

leave it run and search for a few mins! you will get the illusion that it freezes but it dont!

Regards"
