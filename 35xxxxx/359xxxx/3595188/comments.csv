,bucketcheck,2007-06-08T22:12Z,"looks great, but seems like ""ants"" ends abruptly... anyone else have this problem?"
,jegharto,2007-08-18T18:27Z,the ending of last episode is missing. try http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3521716/Dumbland_(xvid12r127-sickboy88)
,TheobaldDancelot,2008-06-24T13:58Z,"yes. this torrent is excellent quality..but cuts off halfway through the last episode. shame.

thanks very much for it though all the same. really enjoyed ""Get the stick"""
,TheobaldDancelot,2008-08-13T15:30Z,i would still recommend this torrent as it has a much higher bitrate than the other active xvid dumbland torrent. episode 8 has to be seen of course..but then i deleted it and kept this one.
