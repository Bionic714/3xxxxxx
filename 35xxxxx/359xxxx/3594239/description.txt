"It has been 11 long years since Green Gartside produced his last album's worth of material. Unsurprisingly there was a great air of expectancy amongst his fanbase for 'Anomie & Bonhomie' to be released. Well, those fans (who must be well into their thirties by now!) can now breathe a sigh of relief because thankfully Scritti Politti's latest album is an impressive return. His voice hasn't changed a bit; it still sounds rather effeminate but in a good way and it sounds beautiful on the slower tracks namely 'First Goodbye' and 'Brushed With Oil, Dusted With Powder' which could easily have been recorded at the same time as his 1985 masterpiece 'Cupid and Psyche '85'. Elsewhere, however, Gartside relies on collabarations with rapper Mos Def and in the main part it works surprisingly well; the rapper's aggressive style versus Gartside gentle sighs working best on 'Tinseltown To The Boogiedown'. Quality control is lowered slightly in the mid-section of the record but to sum up this is a good comeback and it is hoped that we don't have to wait another 11 years for the next album; by which time hopefully Gartside will have shaved off the ridiculous goatee beard he appears to have cultivated during his hibernation!"~ www.leonardslair.co.uk
