,hearthorbeguy,2007-10-14T03:14Z,"Thanks, please seed. Is this 2007 version? Also, if you get a chance please post one for Hindi language. Thanks!"

,charle3,2007-11-02T11:25Z,how the hell do u seed? i'm new to this
,sirusjudex,2007-12-08T16:26Z,"How the hell does this work? Do you have to use the installer because, I tried burning this ISO to a disk and all I get is the file folders, can anyone help?"
,Beonaam,2007-12-30T23:08Z,"Wow thank you.
I just saw the commercial for this one TV. Forget buying it! :P"
,cycleswithin,2008-01-28T14:18Z,"When I burn the German (and French) language ISOs to CD I get an error right at the end saying something like - it can't be finalised properly.

I can burn the Installer disk fine though.

Any ideas?"
,[[[[djinn]]]],2008-01-30T18:08Z,"i can confirm you can use the language .iso's with tiger and leopard macintosh ppc and intel... download:

burn the language .iso with disk utility and enjoy!"
,halospartan,2008-02-14T02:12Z,shit dosent work for vista 64 bit
,ambie0318,2008-02-21T15:41Z,"Alot of problems you might be having is your craeting data discs...I found it easier to just locate the iso through the files and just double click it, I use nero and it just pops up to the correct buring system. I click on DVD and then burn, simple as that...Don't worry though I had the same problem at first, wasted  about 4 dvd's that way! Good luck guys!"
,nicayotte,2008-11-14T01:33Z,"Please seed and as a FYI Th3moos3 has clean torrents have yet to find anything broken or fishy about his torrents!

Thanks in advance"
,the-jester,2008-12-19T00:21Z,"Awesome. Thanks for this torrent!

I'll be seeding as soon as it's done, which looks to be later this evening.

Thanks again!"
,basscymro,2009-06-07T01:14Z,Thank you for this excellent torrent and the install disc.  No problem installing and using this.  Will seed.
,vamsi00,2009-09-08T15:28Z,Dont download this torent as this is an installed file. so this file cannot be used. This is not the installation file.
,MuhammadHussam,2010-10-13T19:41Z,"Hey
to the guys complaining
1) download the RosettaStone Installer Disk ISO
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3595668/RosettaStone_Installer_Disk_ISO_(Th3Moos3)
2) burn this ISO or mount it using any virtual CD/DVD drive program
3) Install the RosettaStone program
4) Insert (or mount) the german language CD
5) Run the RosettaStone program
6) Enjoy !!!"
,jimk770i,2010-11-09T11:19Z,"u can't use this unless u have the Rosetta Stone installation file...:-)
download Rosetta Stone first and install it.
Then install this one as well..."
