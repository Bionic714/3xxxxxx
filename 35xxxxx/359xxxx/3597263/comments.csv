METROWIZZZ will give you the routing on the GPSr!!!
Free program, works really well"
,SerLeo,2007-04-30T14:35Z,How it will be install? With out any unlock?! 
,zx2max,2007-05-02T23:30Z,If it doesnt need to be unlocked then how come i dont see any maps?
,SunyJim,2007-09-26T09:48Z,"Nope can't unlock the bluecharts.
I'm not doing anything to the metroguide to have it not need an unlock. It just comes that way. 
With the metrowizzz software it even routes on the GPSr.

STILL LOOKING FOR GARMIN METROGUIDE NORTH AMERICA V8 PLEASE UPLOAD IF YOU HAVE IT. "
