One 1.38Gb DVD ISO winrar\'d as a single file

I am still looking for the newest version of this Metroguide North America v8
please upload if you have it.

Unfortunately the metroguide series is not-routable on the GPSr, but does contain the same data as the Navigator series. Despite the wording of the latest version v8 of the software on Garmin.com, The metroguide series DOES work quite well on the models of GPSr that are able to route.

 The problem with City Select and Navigator is that they require a serial number that not only matches the product but also your GPSr. So if you download it you might be able to get it working on your computer, but it will still be locked on the GPSr.

As always, no unlock codes are needed for my uploaded Garmin stuff. Enjoy!
