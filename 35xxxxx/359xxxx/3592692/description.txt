This is Sonic R for the PC.  I created these files myself from an original, unscratched game CD.  It's in bin/cue format because I'm not too fond of rips--especially ones that leave out the cheeseball music that makes this game so enchanting.

This game is a bit old for XP, but will still run.  As linkinpark187 said in the comments:


"what you may have to do is:

Right Click Shortcut -> Properties -> Compatibility Tab -> Check Compatibility Mode for -> Windows 98/98SE."


And for the record, it works just fine.  I use this myself because CD drives are laggy and noisy, and I had several friends download the torrent for their own use, and none of us ran into any problems.  I wish I could say that I checked the files for copy errors, but I did not.

I recommend using Daemon Tools to mount the .bin file.
