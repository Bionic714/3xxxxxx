,Maoxx,2007-01-30T14:21Z,Oh dear god I hate Phil Hellmuth so much. Soo much..
,DTTNWO,2007-02-09T08:01Z,"LOL, I don't mind Phillip 'Hellmouth' Hellmuth, even though he is quite abhorrent sometimes, apart from when he puts his chips in the pot really fast. I hate him when he does that. One of the players on this programme 'Sean Sheikhan' is even more abhorrent than Hellmouth"
