,david1,2007-01-19T15:35Z,"Well, except Linkin Park, Slipknot, Queen, Fatboy Slim and Kent (??) there's a few good videos here.. a few I didn't have. Thanks!"
,Trotyl,2007-01-28T23:17Z,"Kent and Fatboy Slim, were mistakes not meant to be included."
,Trotyl,2007-01-31T13:20Z,"Cradle of Filth's ""Cradle to Enslave"" is particularly brutal (unsecored). A girl I know puked when she saw it..."

,david1,2007-06-04T15:54Z,"Trotyl: Seriously? She puked for that? She must have a weak stomach I guess.. that video is so corny, for example Tool makes a lot creepier videos than that..."
,Fire_Woman,2007-11-18T06:06Z,"As long as I can get all of them then I am all on this one. Great Rammy collection. Thanks. :) Comp did a nose dive here and some were Rammy. Yea, I will still seed this. Thanks for this sweet share. "
,Wopatoolie,2008-11-15T04:53Z,most of this isnt metal its garbage
,Wopatoolie,2008-12-16T05:16Z,"sep for queen, this is great if youre into screaming hollaring 'interrogating terrorists' type of noise. this music splintered from actual heavy metal and turned into butt mud, not metal, when Celtic Frost was born. if you pace your parents basement or your one room apt cutting yourself watching Ed Gein 24/7 this is the torrent for you"
