,logos34,2008-08-29T10:54Z,"for any linux users who are wondering why the files are showing up as cbr 160kbps (at least that's what amarok showed), the tags apparently aren't being read correctly. All you need to do is install vbrfix and run it one each track.  You'll see that they're really VBR ~200k range, probably -V1 (xing encoder).

Excellent quality.  Thanks!  This replaces my crappy ~120k rips. "
