Whether you are a believer of peak oil, global warming, new world order and a whole host of other dividing issues, it remains constant that a majority of people believe that: 

- Big business has too much power. 
- As a society, the US is focused on the wrong priorities. 
- We want to give greater priority for children, family, communities and our natural environment. 

We want... 
- A world that puts people ahead of profits. 
- Spiritual values ahead of financial values. 
- International cooperation ahead of international domination. 

Author David Korten speaks about these issues and others at the Veterans For Peace convention in Seattle, Washington about these topics and others.
