You are simply a disruptive moron who is just attempting to put everyone off downloading files.
Almost every file by anyone, uploaded in the last 2 or 3 days has been criticised by you.

I have only one message for you and your like:-
Get A Life!!!

,PaNiS,2007-01-14T14:47Z,A lot of these idiots nowadays on tpb :-(
,brownbillca,2007-01-14T14:52Z,"Are all of you guys mentally retarded or something, yes you guys who are posting ts a virus and that a strong guy is gonna come to my house..


yea a strong guy mite come to my house because im sharing good torrents with you guys and that im 'leaking' private applications, but whatever. no virus, go ahead adn scan it, its a fucking MSInstaller you idiot"
,brownbillca,2007-01-14T14:58Z,"You guys are all idiots, this is the last torrent I am going to upload on this site full of inmature 13 year old kids who think everything is a virus, how bout you try it before you say its a virus you fucking dick.


Damn so many trolls around here, grow up kiddies."
,dpmd,2007-01-14T15:08Z,I was downloading it and AVG Pro 7.5 popped up and told me that it contained a Trojan horse Back Door Generic3.ZIR and stopped the download in Azureus and put the file in the AVG Virus Vault. If you're gonna DL this App just make sure that you scan it before opening peeps. Peace!
,brownbillca,2007-01-14T15:13Z,"I am using NOD32, and it picked up the patch as a unwanted suspicious file because it uses ""getsysdirectory"" which is the same thing some virii use to get your system32 directory path, I assure you this is not a virus..

If you think its a virus, dont download it, simple as that.. I used this on my Vista Machine and it works great, gives you more themes and other cool stuff like that..


im 23 years old, I have a girlfriend and a job, there is no reason for me to be going around trying to infect you guys, i love you guys and this community and I leech from here all the time, please don't think I would try this shit on you.


Thanks and have a good night..

God bless you guys that actually believe me.."

Well, those lame ""viruses"" is no match for my antivirus..

Come on they're trying to confuse us by telling there are viruses and telling us that there are NO viruses in the comments. Who cares? Download and see for yourself if your antivirus reports!
