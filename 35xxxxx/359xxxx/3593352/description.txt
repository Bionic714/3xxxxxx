?Big and Little Flying Dagger? (Tong Leung and Jimmy Lin) are bounty hunters whose attempts at capturing bandits are often scuppered by ?Big and Little Bewitchment? (Sharla Chang and Gloria Yip). When they are asked to capture a particularly heinous bandit and murderer called ?The Nine Tails Fox? (Jackie Cheung), they take up the challenge with gusto. Very quickly, it becomes obvious that Fox is not the bad guy in this story.
