N-LIGNHT-N - DEEP GREEN
-----------------------

Great debut album by N-LIGHT-N from Mandal South of Norway. 5/6 *****

Beside Darkside Of The Force\'\'s debut album, this is the closest you get to a true Norwegian classic. It even got the musicjournalists blessing when it came out in 1997, and it together with BOLT WARHEAD,Warlocks,D O T F and Tommy T set standards, got respected outside the small HH-community  and made way for new acts with record deals. If i'm not totally wrong I think NLIGHTN got som space in THE SOURCE MAGAZINE after this album. 

Well produced by Tommy T and joined by Diaz,Opaque +++  
Fresh,1 in a million & Land of the lost are 3 favorites.

He\'s rapping in english,so its also worth a download for non-scandinavians.

Fresh in any season.

Cheers
