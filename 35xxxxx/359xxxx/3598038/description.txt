A great documentary covering the period of pre-historic life on earth from the first life in the oceans up to the beginning of the age of dinosaurs.

This is an excellent installment from the team that brought you the Walking with Dinosaurs and Walking with Cavemen series.

The animation quality is most excellent and the creatures play in and blend seemlessly with their live footage environment.  In places, there is also some rather humorous creature interactions with the camera.  This show was very well done!
