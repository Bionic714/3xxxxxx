Kay Griggs Interview - The White House, The Military and Ritual Sex Abuse:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Kay Griggs was a Southern divorcee who rented a room to Marine Corps colonel George Griggs in the late 1980s.  She was impressed by his clipped manner, his education, his 

good looks.  Two months later she married him.  What she found out about world affairs as George Griggs' wife was astounding.
 
Colonel Griggs was a Marine Corps Chief of Staff, as well as head of NATO's Psychological Operations.  He was also, his wife realized, entirely mind-controlled.  Kay, a 

self-declared Christian, became privy to the real workings of the United States military, leadership training, drug-running and weapons sales, and the secret worldwide camps 

that train professional assassins.
 
These interviews with Pastor Rick Strawcutter of Adrian, Michigan were conducted in 1998, before September 11th
and the installation of U.S. President George W. Bush. 
Kay Griggs' report of world events and the power elite paints a picture that begins to explain the hows and whys of our current global scenario.


Quotes from Kay Griggs: 


"They took with them the most perverted aspects of Nazi Germany and brought them
over to the United States."

"They get rid of the good guys. The Marine Corps are the assassins for the Mob. The military is run by the Mob. The military IS the Mob." 

"He told me what they did. They nurture--they cultivate--the sons of prominent families. They're called "rising stars." They rope them in. Then they "turn" them."
