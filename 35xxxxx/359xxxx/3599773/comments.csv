,stukaville,2009-12-20T18:36Z,"ive just logged on and saw someone stuck at 99.6%. Unfortunately ive got the music, but not the original torrent. I tried to re download my own torrent file but it wont recognise the folder.

I would bother but i saw 50 peers still waiting. Can anyone who wants this leave a message in a comment and i will create a new torrent for it if peeps still want this. regards"
