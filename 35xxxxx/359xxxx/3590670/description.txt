Texas Calculatem is a separate and independent program that was 
created to give PC users a significant advantage over other online 
poker players.  The program basically allows you to "cheat" by
rooting itself in with the live poker table server and mathematically
calculating the odds of what other people might have according
to how they are playing and what cards are in the flop, etc.
The card reading is fully automatic so all you have to do is sit
back and relax while the program tells you what your next move should be.
