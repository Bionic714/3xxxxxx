Since everyone has been so supportive of me & my efforts here at TPB, I would like to share a home video of my mother saying hello; I am what I am today because of her motherly love. 

I'm sure many of you have our own mother stories; please feel free to share them & post your comments as many other TPB members may not be as fortunate as we are.

Mommy; I love you.

PS, your balls are getting hairy again; please shave them as I'm getting rash burns
