Torrents are being made becuase they are interesting, funny, cool to others, or one of several other reasons. 

Free or not free iis not important. Imagine how many people that isn't familiar with this application.

Guys, make more torrents based on freeware, shareware or others of you think that other people might find them interesting !!!

... to 'Jmraub86': If it wasn't for the research that goes into NASA's ""crap"" most of the technology that we use nowadays we wouldn't have. Unfortunately, or fortunately, there isn't attached to every bit of technology we take for granted (like the adv'd tech on new telephones, as a small example) a little reminder that that technology was forwarded by some NASA ""crap"" unbeknownst by the standard noob-citizen (read, moron).
I actually think a lot of technological advances should only be used by folk with a certain capacity altuistic & intellectual capacity. The rest of you neanderthals should continue grunting and whatnot, because you all really offer nothing to the so-called ""betterment of society"" in the long run anyway. Most folk are like weeds found in every garden; they must exist but there are just so many of them."
