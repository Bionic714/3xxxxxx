,majtymicke,2007-01-17T21:57Z,Aha? And what does all that french mean in English?
,majtymicke,2007-01-17T22:03Z,Any chance of a .avi rip of this? I dont want to download 4gb and find out that its bad.
,obukowski,2007-01-17T22:25Z,There's english audio for this one?
[V],iggy.stooge,2007-01-17T22:41Z,Seems to be english audio but its a pity they took away the english subs too.
,obukowski,2007-01-18T00:52Z,I was asking about english audio cause Finding forrester who was supposed to have english audio too was only spanish...
,madjock56R,2007-01-18T00:59Z,"Its not french its spanish.

AUDIO: EspaÂąol 2.0, InglĂŠs 2.0

Ingles = english.

I would imagine you would be alright, why would you need english subs if there is english audio ?"
[V],iggy.stooge,2007-01-18T06:32Z,"Its easier to understand the language if you have a hearingproblem and/or isnt too good in english, and you both can read it and hear it.

Of course I would have prefered swedish subs but you cant get everything always ;)"

,orgpunk,2007-01-23T07:12Z,"The rip was great, but the movie looked homemade."
