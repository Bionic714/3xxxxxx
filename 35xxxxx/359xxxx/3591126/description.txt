   Submarine Titans, a futuristic real-time strategy game, dares to go
   where no RTS has gone before - plunging players deep into an immense
   and spellbinding underwater world, where three future civilizations are
   locked in a battle for supremacy. In the year 2047, the Clark Comet
   strikes the earth's surface with such astounding force that life as we
   know it is virtually wiped out. Taking to subterranean vaults and
   makeshift undersea installations, several thousand humans escape the
   blight of the comet and the ensuing ravages of a weather system that
   reaps havoc on land.
   
   Over the next century, humankind slowly adapts to their oceanic habitat
   and evolves into two rival civilizations: the White Sharks - who hunger
   for dominance over the underwater universe; and the technologically
   advanced and environmentally protective Black Octopi, who will go to
   any extremes necessary to remain in balance with the Earth. As the
   Sharks and Octopi gather resources and build their forces to prepare
   for an inevitable clash, an alien race uncoils itself from within the
   resource-laden crater deep on the ocean floor. In the year 2115, all
   three races erupt in an epic struggle that seems destined to destroy
   man's final bid for survival.
   
   Submarine Titans' addictive and compelling gameplay enables players to
   command one of three civilizations in a range of fully 3D battlescapes.
   The game environment is divided into 5 depth levels in which players
   and their opponents can hide behind or under 3D terrain for
   unparalleled offensive and defensive maneuvering. According to the
   developer, players can opt to have a computer AI assist them, by taking
   over mundane tasks, so that they can concentrate on the areas of the
   game they most enjoy. With the use of the Scenario-editor, players will
   have the opportunity to create their own scenarios and maintain the
   same control over elements as the game designers themselves.
   
   These features combined with Ellipse's revolutionary dual control
   interface, which gives players the option of controlling individual
   units or entire groups, as well as simultaneously planning production
   and launching attacks against opponents, promises to take Submarine
   Titans way beyond anything other games will be offering in the near
   future.
   
   Supporting 3D sound and resolutions of 800 x 600 to 1280 x 1024
   graphics, Submarine Titans will submerge players into an iridescent
   world of fantasy and adventure. Multiplayer action over LAN and
   Internet will allow up to 24 players - including 8 AI opponents and 8
   spectators - to watch and take part, as the action unfolds in this
   extraordinary aquatic adventure.
