try running it in compatibility mode w98 or even w95

guys i started seeding this torrent again,but my upload is terrible as im on ADSL
so you ""will"" get the game,but it will take very long
if anyone would keep seeding this game,it would be awesome,as this torrent is as far as i can see unique"
,Thunderbird Anthares,2008-10-28T23:37Z,"this torrent works,if you have problems with the game,its your ""local"" problems
i played the game just few minutes ago

try searching for solutions on the net,google is a powerful tool :-)"
