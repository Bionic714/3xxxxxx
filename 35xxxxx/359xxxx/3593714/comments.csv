,BritneysOrifice,2007-01-10T20:16Z,pilot121: greets. Thanks for this torrent. Do you know if this particular package is an installer or a rip?
[T],stevekasian,2007-01-10T21:00Z,"Don't see a response yet on your question, but if it is a RIP I've got the installer and will upload if you like. The installer is 429,092KB. @ 511,987KB this one may be @ RIP.  If Pilot121 reports it's a RIP, reply here & lemme know if you want the installer and I'll post a torrent for it."
,pilot121,2007-01-10T21:05Z,Hi It is a RIP from Another Torrent Only i have had it sitting on my desktop for ages i never seen it here so i uploaded it here if u want the installer let me know i will make u one
,neslesman,2007-01-10T21:37Z,"What the heck is this thing, can't tell if it's AI or just what from either sim market or the Overland web site.
I'm surprised we don't see more Japanese stuff you know.  Flight Sim would be a real natural for the culture but not much makes it over here.  Wonder why, they sure aren't shy about marketing other products world wide and produce some excellent quality stuff."

[T],stevekasian,2007-01-31T02:16Z,"Just a little update here 4 anyone who'se reading thru these comments looking for an installer for ""Overland Fly! Into The Sky"":
It turns out that my ""installer"" is not a complete package, but rather just the .msi module... which, unfortulately, requires a support package (installer .exe) be useful. So as of this post, I NO NOT have an installer for it. :-( Sorry folks.

,piroszsiraf,2007-02-21T15:28Z,"Hi,

The original installer is not needed for the patch.

All you need is a msi extract tool like LessMSIerables.

Do the following to install the patch:

1. Start the patch (it is a InstallShield wizard). It will complain because the original package is not installed . Do not close the installer!

2. Check the \Documents and Setting\YourProfile\LocalSettings\Temp folder
The installer extract its content to this folder.
Search for a .msi file with the size of 98588672 bytes.

3. Copy this file to somewhere else.
You can exit the installer as soon as the file copied. The installer will delet the file from the TEMP folder.

4. Open the msi file with LessMSIerables and extract the content.

5. Overwrite the files in FS9\Aircraft and FS9\Gaguges folder.

BR,
Zsiraf"
