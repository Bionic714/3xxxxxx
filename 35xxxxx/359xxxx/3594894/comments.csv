,pycnopodia,2010-01-08T13:28Z,"Sorry i am a total noob about these things. I downloaded the files, I have dosbox, nero, alcohol 120%. But how do I proceed?

I tried to burn them to dvd but alcohol wont start (says waiting for disk even though i have  a blank dvd rw in there). The write method is DAO/SAO, I dont know which datatype to use so its set to custom. Infact all I see are audio tracks... lol im lost"
,pycnopodia,2010-01-08T13:33Z,"wow, okay so I can access the audio files... but alcohol doesnt seem to recognize the .bin ...."
,tombenko,2011-01-27T19:26Z,Thanks for the files!
,auhorse,2012-05-01T04:46Z,"Would someone mind explaining the step-by-step process of how to play?  I am sorta just haphazardly going about it without success.  Thank you pre-emptively.  Cheers.

I can't believe I get to replay this game from my childhood; I couldn't beat it/complete it then... I look forward to restarting and enjoying it a second time."
