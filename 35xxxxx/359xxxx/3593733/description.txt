i know, it is an old game, but i found this extractor on my hdd, yesterday. i got this tool at last Coding.Cracking.Kernelpanic - so, it is a >never comeback<... :-|

all files from the german version. if you do not like this game, it is a reason to get just the stuff of it, cos there are both realy great music and samples (all ingame sfx and the speech of amy, spoken in german).
