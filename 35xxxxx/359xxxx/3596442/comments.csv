,campos13,2007-01-15T10:30Z,"you can download it or not, its real not fake I wouldnt waste my time seeding fake shit.. I'm telling you this is real and when you see other ppl commenting on it then you will know.."
,madjock56R,2007-01-15T10:37Z,"Its real as in its a real DVD Screener.

Maybe if you put down the truth, there would be no people commenting on it.

Does it still have the glitches in it, and if it does not then they have been clipped out.

Just tell the truth for fuck sake, I take it you took the menu out yourself did you, yah whatever."
,campos13,2007-01-15T10:41Z,"no its not a screener, and im telling you the truth like i said above you can believe me or not.. I personally dont care if you dont download it.."
,madjock56R,2007-01-15T10:52Z,"Just because it has no marks, black and whites does not mean its a proper DVD.

Where is the menu ?
A retail DVD will always have some other subs.

I think you are full of shit to be honest, you are the only owner of a full dvd of Apocalypto, I bet the groups would love to have your sources,,,,Fuck off..."
,campos13,2007-01-15T11:01Z,"i saw a few glitches but that was it.. my sources are great, :) soon.. we are marshal, the good shepard, children of men and more... coming soon."

,campos13,2007-01-15T11:10Z,"you can do what u want, but if you do download this copy and watch it you will see the quality is great and clear except for the glitches that aren't long."
,ksoktogon,2007-01-15T11:11Z,"Will you please give away the secret where this DVD comes from? Any reliable info, internet address, IMDB etc will do. If there is any...."
,campos13,2007-01-15T11:13Z,"i dont know where it comes from i get it from someone who gets it from his friend, he wont tell me because i buy them and now im starting to upload them for everyone else... but take my word you wont regret downloading this copy.."
,madjock56R,2007-01-15T11:21Z,"Well we dont buy them, and I think you will find that the glitches are in the other 3 versions on this site.

But if all you wanna do is upload the same shit, its up to you, and for you guys who download it, tough luck."
,campos13,2007-01-15T11:23Z,all 3 might have glitches i personally havent downloaded those copies but im very confident that this copy will be the best quality..
,madjock56R,2007-01-15T11:28Z,Well start downloading them instead of buying copies and you might find you get the same stuff....strange eh.
,campos13,2007-01-15T11:31Z,"actually know there not the same from reading about the other copies, it says in the last 40 mins the audio is out of sync, my copy is not out of sync.."
,madjock56R,2007-01-15T11:33Z,"Lol

Maybe you are the same as me I watched the whole film and never noticed ether, people are to busy looking for sync problems and not reading the subs as far as Im concerned."
,campos13,2007-01-15T14:44Z,"well after watching the whole entire thing ur right its a screener but a damn good one, the quality and sound are great.."

Proper Notes:

The TGP release had a bad video starting at 1:36:42 and some
audio delay at same time. We think that movie is worth watching
it, so we decided to bring you that proper release with the
known MENTiON quality.
