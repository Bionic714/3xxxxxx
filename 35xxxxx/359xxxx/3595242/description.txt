This is the DVD of

The Mathematica guidebook for Programming

It contains all the book in .nb format, that you can easily read and print from mathematica, in evaluated form, and notebook of other guidebook in unevaluated form. Also, it contains all animations of the book.

This is much better that a poor (and huge) scan of the book!!!
