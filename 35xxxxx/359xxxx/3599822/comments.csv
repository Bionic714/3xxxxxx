EViews 5, QMS continues its tradition of innovation by blending the best of modern spreadsheet and relational database technology with the traditional tasks of statistical software. The result is a program that provides unprecedented power wrapped in an intuitive easy-to-use user interface.

Thanks a lot."
,titanothon,2008-09-25T05:08Z,"I'm confused about the machine ID as well, all the ""readme"" says is Install app, use keygen and Manual Registration - how did you get yours to do it? I'm just a poor student!"
,tejrone,2010-04-30T17:25Z,"This thing works but has no explanation. To get a serial code to run Eviews, this thing requires you to have a Machine ID. But to get your Machine ID, you have to run Eviews and find it using the help tab. Hello Catch 22. 

To get around this, google ""machine ID"" and look at the Eviews link - http://register1.eviews.com/help/machine_id.html

The circled thing is an example of a Machine ID. However, if you put this example one into the keygen, it actually works and will generate you a serial code. Worked for me twice. "
