,earnesty,2010-08-01T05:04Z,"Martin: re: destroying your entire life; 
Not to sound impudent, but I'm sure glad you are doing what you've been doing for a while - sharing all these doc's can only have a positive effect.  

I'm reminded of a quote I came across recently (in 'The Constant Gardener' I think) originally made by H.G. Wells: ""Civilization is a race between disaster and education.""

You're spreading education!

Personally, I'm really looking forward to seeing these doc's and I had to register to show my gratitude; thanks!"
,Bitts1,2010-09-08T03:36Z,"I usually don't drop a comment but in this case I think it's about time. Thank you for uploading this. 

I admire in some way what Oreo said in the end; ""I don't want anyone to feel pity on me...I just. Nobody decided. No one forced me to become a junkie, a poor decision. It's the thing we have to live with""

But still you can't help it to feel pity for them. Ofc it's their decision, but still. That is a horrible way to live your life :-("
,Bitts1,2010-09-08T04:03Z,"Did some digging about Steven Okazaki. Quite a guy. If you feel like it, read this short interview about the movie:

,JayArgo,2011-07-15T21:16Z,"An extremely grim but well made and eye-opening documentary. What happened to the 2004 update? It would be nice to see what's happened to them, good or bad.

@Bitts1 thanks for the interview link, very interesting."
