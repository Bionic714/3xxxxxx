You are right, the ALPHAnaut track New Shoes you are referring too is actually Neurozap by Alphanaut. This mistake is probably perpetuated from the wrong tracklisting given on http://www.discogs.com/release/163404, which I have so I just checked. Funnily enough the other Goa Head torrent, which isn't being seeded for 100% does have the correct Alphanaut New Shoes (with the cheesy Captain Picard 'Maximum Warp' sample). 

So does the original Goa Head Volume 3 CD2 really have New Shoes or Neurozap?!? Discogs has it listed as New Shoes, so I'm inclined to go with that, but I don't have a physical copy so I can't check this out."
