,usrxxx,2007-01-25T22:45Z,"We added clickable links to all of our screen shots (usrxxx - and - latricia2k6), which the admins removed for whatever reason.

We won't be uploading to Pirate Bay anymore because of their removal. We put far too much time and effort into making screen shots, and writing synopsis's, to have PB admins remove the conveinient links to them.

You will all need to go elsewhere to find further installments of any of our series's. Sorry!"
