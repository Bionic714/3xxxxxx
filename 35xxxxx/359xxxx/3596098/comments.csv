[V],Kuthumi,2007-07-16T11:10Z,"There are 3 image file dvds numbered 1, 3 and 5 possibly because the box set contains discs with extras. 

To burn an .img file: Just rename it to .iso and double-click it. If you have Nero Burning ROM installed on your computer, it will start automatically and know what to do. Or right-click it and open it in some burning software."
[V],Kuthumi,2007-07-24T09:19Z,"Each of the 3 files is approx. 4.5 Giga. Filename .d1 is Red Dragon, .d3 is Silence of the Lambs, .d5 is Hannibal. You may uncheck files you don't need when opening the torrent and only dl one or two of them. Advice for burning .img files is given in my comment on page 1. Thanks to metaljimmy83 for this job!"
