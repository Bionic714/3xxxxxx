https://msdn.one.microsoft.com/DownloadFrame.aspx?ContentID=2-11212&CID=2-11212&Called=Home

Please make a torrent for the Swedish MUI"
[V],jnd,2007-01-10T18:42Z,"^-- Link requires a valid MSDN subscription that covers the MUI feature... Since you could access it (?), why don't you download it? :)"
,vl_vista,2007-01-10T19:11Z,"Because I don not have an account, i just know the link. Please make a torrent."

That's all it said!"
,jappe6,2007-01-12T18:25Z,Hittar fan ingen Swedish MUI pack på MSDN - är du säker på att översättningarna ligger ute? Annat vore märkligt med tanke på att den ju faktiskt finns för Norska och alla möjliga andra avarter till språk.

,rowborough,2007-02-05T23:27Z,"I have bean in the longhorn research program for three years and have fully tested all versions of longhorn-Vista in all operating areas. 


As a IT pro and can catagoricaly say vista is a piece of crap that needs at least another year of development, avoid like the plague wait for at least service pack 1 (although from my testing it may be 2 3 or 4) 


It could have bean great, its not ."
,rowborough,2007-02-06T16:57Z,"do not you people listen, this version of Vista is a dog and you will curse the fact you downloaded it. 


I have worked on the longhorn project for 3 years and this release is way way to early ( put presure to make money has come first) 


Dont be a idiot stick with XP till the bugs are ironed out (and you get full driver and update suport) 


Please believe me this software in any form is the most bug riden piece of crap I have ever Beta tested..... 


I tell no lies :)"
,painkill,2007-02-07T22:38Z,"I GOT IT WORKING WITHOUT A CRACK AND NO TIMELIMIT!!!

I JUST USED 3 SIMPLE STEPS!!!
There are 2 ways:
(having xp installed, clean pc)

1st option (xp installed)

1 restart pc, go to bios using delete button on startup, change youre date to 50 years from now. start youre pc

(REMOVE INTERNET CABLES! DO NOT CHOOSE UPDATE AND DO NOT ENTER AN SERIAL!)
2 mount youre version of vista with daemon tools or whatever and install vista ( you do not have to burn vista on dvd, just directly mount it from youre pc).  If you can you have to keep youre old files, you van select this during the installation. when you cant you will have to live with the fact that you cant install vista without removing youre xp files. in the last case select the bottom option. note: vista will put all of youre xp files in a folder in windows vista, so you can always get them back.

go on with the installation.
vista will restart a couple of times.

3 whatever you do never download updates, you have to set the time to its original state, 50 years back in my example. 

This is how i got working vista and no time limit!

plz mail me with comments!


and remember never download updates!!"

,msm86,2007-03-19T13:29Z,How J can download this?
,phreaks2007,2007-04-08T00:19Z,"Dudes: how to install the language stuff:
Copy the mui folder or files in the corresponding language folder located in : C:\Windows\System32\En-us if you install the us version, \fr-FR for the french one, and so on...
(Give administrator rights to do so)
Then open Control Pannel/ Clock, language, and Region /Keyboards and Language/ Install//Uninstall Language/ Install Language/ Browse Folder. 
Browse to the System32 language folder, install and you're all set!"

,whitestarrebel,2008-08-06T07:02Z,"hey, do u guys know any other way of installing this besides phreaks2007 instructions, cause my computer wont let me make the en-us file on system 32, rewritable, therefore i cannot copy the file i just downloaded, any ideas? "
,scwal69,2009-01-11T01:40Z,"Have you to uncopress the data to the folder FR-fr for exemple or just take the folder and paste it into system 32 ???
Cause vista says to me is incompatible with my version of windows witch is a ultimate one ??"
