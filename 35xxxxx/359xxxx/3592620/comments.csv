[T],stevekasian,2007-01-09T02:21Z,Which is better - Aerosoft Budapest or LAGO Budapest? Opinions??
,BritneysOrifice,2007-01-09T16:36Z,"xaver & steve: Yeah, both versions are done by the same guy. LAGO's was done some years ago and was absolutely great. Naturally, the latest Budapest is better since it was completely re-done. However, one of the cool things was that LAGO's Budapest included a big, fat chunk of ""extra"" scenery around the city of Budapest (which the new Aerosoft release doesn't include since the designer didn't re-do that portion).  Cool thing is that -- if you check the Aerosoft forums -- the designer provided some instructions on installing BOTH and being able to 'sandwich' the two sceneries so that you get the new airport as well as the surrounding city. Btw... thanks for this GAP4 Installer. 4X was right; it's a tough find, so thanks very much!"
