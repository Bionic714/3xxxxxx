Even our first 'First Lady' in Germany Miss Merkel is already infected by the Bush and Co Virus. But we must see the other side to:
How many EU nation has been member of the criminal Coalition of Willing? So, the uS without Blair, Aznar, Berlusconi and the new European had never started the war against Iraq.

where do you get these numbers?
any proof to what your saying?


what do you think kerry would have done for our country? welfare reform...?
please get your head out your ass and stop watching micheal moore movies..
ask any troop that comes back from iraq.. they will be shocked when they turn on and all they show is the death in iraq.
they never show the positives.
terrorism kills roughly 300?
did everyone just forget about september 11th?
i think so.
these people are trying to kill us and your family but you sit back and just give them more ammo for there guns.
pathetic.
you people are anti american./

,spacey41,2007-01-09T10:10Z,"did everyone just forget about september 11th???? (quote intheBox)

ERR practically all the bombers were Saudis, NONE were from Iraq.

GW and the boys blow up afghanistan and Iraq killing hundreds of thousands

GW and the boys kiss Saudi Butt whenever they can and in fact have close business links with them.

Wheres the logic dude?

Iraq has never to anyones knowledge ever even thought about threatening USA or UK

And funnny how everyone forgets ANY WMDs found yet ?? You know the main reason for the ILLEGAL WAR hmmmm i smell BS and it aint nice  
"
,intheb0x,2007-01-14T06:52Z,"you still dont answer my question
where do you get 650,000 from?
any proof to that number?
i think not.

also dont you remember saddam NOT letting weapons inspectors come in to look.
what was there to hide?

did you forget about the russians coming in there right before the war happened..
?
im sure thats where the wmds went.
when you have every intelligence agency in the
world telling you he has them what would you do?

but no one ever brings up the nerve agents found and such. those arent big weapons right?

you talk about us having nuclear weapons.
SO WHAT?
god knows we arent going to use them
but take IRAN for example
you want him to have NUCLEAR weapons so he can WIPE ISREAL off the map as he said NUMEROUS amounts of time.

that arguement is garbage talking about us having wmds but they dont.

keep your crap rheroric to yourself.

also whats so bad about fox news?
are you mad its the only news agency that shows BOTH sides of the story and not your sorry pathetic side?

dont even bring up how we killed a few innocent people and how the soliders died. since when do we worry about causalties of a war before going in? theres always more casulties.

what about the murder rate in some citys in the us? alot higher then that.
come on

its not my problem clinton was a pushover for saddam.. u know clinton and his STRONG WORDED LETTERS really showed how strong the US was..


alot of the people in iraq have been killing eachother for many many years. its there religon. thats how it works for them.

you say thats half the world hates bush.
who cares?
honestly answer that question.

the terrorists are mad that they cant plan and follow through on attacks in the US anymore.
there mad that we are in iraq and blowing them up. you guys support the terrorists.
point blank.

stop talkin about how it was wrong how we went into iraq.
it happened we did it your side voted for it.
we cant just pull out now.
ask any troop what they think.
they will tell you we have to stay. ask any troop that comes back over here and turns on the tv.

they wont believe the negativity they see on tv. the anti american views all over tv.
ask them seriously they will tell you about the good things going on there.

you know before saddam like 10% had cellphones. now that went up to what? 80%.
the pay increases and the job rate is going up and up.
dont forget about the iraqis voting.
they just did that for no reason tho right?

you guys won stop being so angry all the time
lol

now pull us out of iraq and make the us look soft. make iran laugh at us more.. you know like you guys said we need to TALK to iran and syria.. they will tell us what to do right???????????do something better for the country like welfare reform and public health care
lmfao!

,memyselfandwho,2007-01-24T17:44Z,"George Bush is only part of the problem.  You also have these stupid terrorists who need to be shot, hung and tortured when discovered.  They are a sickness to all in this world, not just America.  You say America is so bad but we keep letting immigrants in.  So I would have to say I agree with you that America is STUPID.  We should stop letting other countries and races in.  NO MORE!  Plus, getting rid of Bush would help.  Do what I did, move to a new country.  It helps."

You say ""these people are trying to kill us""
wrong. who are 'these' people, and who sold them their weapoms of mass destruction in the 1st place.
Who backed & funded the assassination of both Iraq & Irans democratically elected leaders decades ago, and installed the puppet regimes?
It was the United States of America.
Read ""The Great Game"" by Peter Hopkirk  and grow up."
