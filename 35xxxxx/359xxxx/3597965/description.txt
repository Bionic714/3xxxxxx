Are you getting intrested? Considering *teh Switch* ?
Get Ubuntu! http://www.ubuntu.com
Ubuntu Linux is a distriution (= ~version) of Linux that is particularly easy to install and use: if you are used with the Windows operating system, you *are* able to use Ubuntu Linux (and a llot of other distributions) without any problem, Ubuntu is the most widely recommended to first-time users becaus of the really easy install and almost absence of the need for post-install configuartion; yet it is a complete Linux distribution and just as powerful and versatile as other Linux distributions.
Get ubuntu Linux completely free of charge at http://www.ubuntu.com
Burn the .iso image using Nero or equivalent Burn Image and reboot your PC: that will load your Linux system directly from the CD, so you can try it out, see hot it looks and feels, use programs etc, *without* actually installing anything. Reboot without the CD in the tray and your Windows system will be still that, nothing changed.
To install the OS on the Hard Disk all you need to do is clicking the Install icon and follow the on-screen instructions (Dont forget to back up your data!)
You *do* want to do some reading before running Install, but it's won't be anything diffcult; lots of help for both beginners and experts is available on http://www.ubuntuforums.org
