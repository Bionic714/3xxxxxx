For other torrents that I seed it only lets me go up to that amount. I used utorrent and i have the max at 100 and had it at 150 and also used the original bittorrent and still will only give me a max of 45-50. My router is the linksys WRT54G i think version 2 and all firm ware is up to date and i tryed to call and they really dont give help for p2p sharing. So if anyone has had this problem or knows how to fix it help me out so i can get this torrent going a little bit faster.

Thanks taddict"

Some ISP's throttle Bittorrent traffic on the 6881 port. Try changing your Bittorrent port to something in the 49000 - 51000 range.

In uTorrent, the setting is under Options | Preferences | Connection. If it's not already an open port, you might have to open it in both your router and operating system or software firewall.
