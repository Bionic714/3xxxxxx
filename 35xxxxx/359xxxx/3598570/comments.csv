,kpkt22,2010-01-28T00:32Z,"Been to -a lot- of concerts since '76, this is definitely top 3. The message is from another time, 10 days before the minions of darkness and evil did their work on the minds and hearts of people in this world and continues even more intensely to this day. This event is a saving Grace, even prophetic. Some may see this quality sooner, hopefully all can realize it for a better tomorrow.

Seeded this puppy up about 10x. When I get the bigger HD to be sure it will go back in the cue. Please consider to seed until you have watched it 30+ times :-)) 

Plays as straight from the case, no worries. A few nice extras included.

Blessings."
