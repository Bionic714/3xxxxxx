We had a big flood in the basement about 10 years ago and I lost all of my old games due to water damage. It made me sick :(

Thanx for sharing all these goodies :)"

It's pretty intuitive and easy to use so nobody should have any problems. Once again, thanks for these awesome games."

,BoxMac,2011-10-25T02:27Z,"Thank you.

From the bottom of my iPad 2 & it's Frotz interpreter's heart ...."
,BoxMac,2011-10-27T04:05Z,"By the way, I was having a Devil of a time getting these on my iPad 2 in FROTZ by following thier own directions. 

Here's a better, foolproof way ....
1] Attach .Z files to an email
2] Send it to yourself
3] Tap the attachment
4] A box will pop up: OPEN IN FROTZ.
5] Tap it.  

FROTZ will open with the game you tapped. 
Tap STORY LIST & there it is along with all the free IF stories FROTZ-iOS comes with.

Enjoy!"
