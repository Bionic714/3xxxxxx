,apoptos,2007-01-19T01:39Z,thanks for upload... PAL or NTSC?
,thewonderer,2007-01-19T03:20Z,"its a region4 australia disc, so it should be PAL

Video: MPEG2 Video 720x576 (16:9) 25.00fps 9800Kbps [Video]
Audio: Dolby AC3 48000Hz 6ch 448Kbps [Audio]

comes from mplayer classic.

I wouldn't be suprised if they re-release it in the future sometime because i'm pretty sure it's not anamporphic. But it's still a good picture and the only 1 out there that is the movie and fits a normal dvd-r  (torrentharvestor proved that)

Thanx for the appreciation.

I only have 25kb/s upload speed at best and limited allowance down under :("
,=michael=,2007-01-19T07:57Z,you can remove the regio code for yourself very easy!!!
,Hei_p책-deg,2007-01-20T18:38Z,Love this anime movie
,thewonderer,2007-01-21T02:25Z,"Just to confirm, it was originally a region 4 dvd (PAL) but the region coding has been removed by DVD Shrink.

Think I shot myself in the foot when i said it wasn't anamorphic. The cover days it is 2.00:1  Think when i was watching some on the pc it didn't look like it.

Either way, I'm sure you guys will all enjoy this like I did :)

As you can see, someone has already upped the 2nd disc. I watched a bit. The said the girl was modelled on a real girl that the director knew and the parents too."
,thewonderer,2007-01-21T02:26Z,"BTW, if anyone has the remastered dvd of Ghost in the Shell (1995 movie) would appreciate that! ;)"
,subw00ter,2007-01-30T23:35Z,"Please SEED, i see about 30 peers all capped at around 85% because there's no seeder.  Please just seed for a while so the rest of us can start seeding."
,subw00ter,2007-02-01T00:43Z,"OK, now i see 30 peers capped at 98.9%.  Can the uploader seed for just a little bit longer so we can continue?  Thanks"
,chipxsd,2007-06-09T09:55Z,"Thanks for the upload, and thanks to the people seeding the content.

I didn't watch the whole DVD yet, just the beginning. I noticed the original movie on DVD was recorded in interlaced mode. It's very noticeable during hi speed - motion blur scenes. When the DVD was shrunk, the interlaced option must have been turned off, or it was very badly de-interlaced. It doesn't bother me that much, you'll get used to it too.

The sound is gorgeous. It's only in English, but in full AC3 (dd5.1).

Overall, it's great! 9/10"
,speakeasy,2007-08-18T21:47Z,Brilliant - thanks a lot.
,Davidow,2008-02-03T20:23Z,"It's a shame that there is NO JAPANESE AUDIO or any menus!

In other words it's a bit unnessesary to have to download 4.4gigs when you could just download a dvdrip with about the same quality in 700megs.

Anyway, thanks for uploading."
,Zeptinune,2011-08-25T21:20Z,"@Davidow

Dude you're kinda stupid. 700MB DVD-Rips aren't as good quality as 4.38GB disc copies. Even without the menus or Jap Audio it's worth downloading the DVD-Copy if you can and have the net speed/patience.

Sure if you're on a shitty plan with limits or whatever get the 700MB Rip.

The difference between a shitty 700MB rip is that, it will look like shit on a large TV like mine (37"") where as this 4.38GB Copy will look at least, good/acceptable. The __bitrate__ difference between a shitty 700MB Rip and a 4.38GB Copy is absolutely huge. We're taking fuckloads more quality. Just because the video size is the same on both sizes doesn't mean the 700MB one is anywhere near as anamorphic or high quality."
,Mattman4494,2011-12-24T22:03Z,Just what I was looking for!  Much thanks!!!
