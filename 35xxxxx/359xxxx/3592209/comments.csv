,kongHansi,2007-01-10T19:42Z,Cmon seed!!
,ssokosta,2007-01-11T05:22Z,"I AM seeding! How come that I've already uploaded more than the size of the movie (in fact 4.30 GiB) and you people have only 28%? This is my first torrent, I have only downloaded before, so I believe I need a piece of advice here. Shall I minimize the number of peers and keep, say, only two?"
,kongHansi,2007-01-11T19:46Z,"Don't ask me, I have no clue:-) I just like naging when the my DLspeed reaches zero ;-) 
Btw thanx for the torrent, I've looked for this movie for quite a while"
,ssokosta,2007-01-11T20:27Z,"U R welcome )) I am doing my best uploading this movie - have turned off all downloading since January 8, though my upload speed is only 30k. It just sucks to see that I have uploaded more than 100% of the file and no peer has it in full. I just don't get it, I've been always thinking that what bittorrent clients do is spltting the files in many smaller pieces and sharing them at the same time with peers. So as soon as 100% percent is out, everybody will be able to get it without me! But no f**king way, I have to wait )))) This will be my first and last upload, dudes )))"
,kongHansi,2007-01-16T13:17Z,*sigh* 93% and stuck... boo hoo
,ssokosta,2007-01-16T13:28Z,I am here and still uploading ;) Patience!
,kongHansi,2007-01-16T17:05Z,"nice :-)

Omg this movie better be as good as I remember, or I think I'm gonna slash my wrists :-D"
,ssokosta,2007-01-16T17:26Z,"This one is my favourite comedy, you remember it right!! It's hilarious!"
,sokosta,2007-06-16T14:11Z,"I'm glad that this torrent is still alive. If there happens to be no seeder, just drop me a line at koleno@nm.ru and I will help. Enjoy!"
,ogg2009,2010-10-16T18:22Z,Thanks for the upload great film which i lost.
,qazwsx123454,2011-04-04T14:58Z,"ssokosta: As the initial uploader, upload at least 10x file size with full upload speed. Later on, if the interest is high, you can decrease your own upload speed if you need to.

the reason no one had it in this case if because they got tired of waiting and cancelled the download.

As a leeacher, I have my download manager to stop seed at ratio 3:1 and max three seeds at once with total speed cap of my half internet bandwidth. Works good."
