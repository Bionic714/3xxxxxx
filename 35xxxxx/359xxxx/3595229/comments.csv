,TheUnit2,2009-02-15T09:30Z,"If I may be extremely nitpicky:
There's a flipped bit in the 172708018th byte of 24.S01E06.05.00.am-06.00.am.AC3.DVDRip WS XviD-FOV.avi
I double checked, and compared with multiple sources including FOV's original rars.
It probably has no visible effect though, so no big deal.
Thanks for the upload asdfylkjqw!"
