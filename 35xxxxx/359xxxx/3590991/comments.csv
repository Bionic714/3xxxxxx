,skoobydubie,2007-01-06T19:39Z,Great game. Played it forever. I have found that it crashes a lot on xp until I found the secret on a message board. Go to your screen properties and change it to 16 bit colors. No more dropped games. Enjoy.
,cobra189,2007-01-09T00:01Z,I love this game.  I'm gonna be really disappointed if it doesn't work.
,Indrid_Cold,2007-01-29T17:46Z,"This doesn't work goddamn it! Did everything right, but when I try to play (clicking the DKII.exe-icon) a black screen appears, and then I'm chucked back into Windows. Disappointing!"
,draildatrain,2007-01-30T21:38Z,"got it to work with 16bit colour on xp, but still crashes every now and again"

,dooooook,2009-09-03T19:17Z,has anyone tryed the compatibility modes?
,SimianJ,2011-03-08T20:12Z,"The Torrent works HOWEVER for those on windows 7: You will need a NO CD crack, you will also need to modify the settings on the SHORTCUT: set to compatibility mode windows xp, disable visual themes and disable desktop composition. Once in the game disable hardware acceleration in the graphics properties then load a level for the graphics engine to reboot and the changes to take effect. This also appears to be the Silver version which means it will crash somewhere around level 4 of the campagne."
,jrobbed16,2012-06-04T14:55Z,"worked great after i used the crack (windows 7) i was having a strange problem where i couldnt see anything when the game started up, i did what SimianJ said, but i also had to raise my gamma. it was at the lowest setting for some reason. Great download!"
,jrobbed16,2012-06-05T19:35Z,"I have a little update here: as soon as i tried to play it for a second time, it wont load up the game, it immediately stops working and closes its self. Can anyone help?"
