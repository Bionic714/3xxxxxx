I hope you enjoy them, that is why I have posted them. "
,snaykbyt,2007-01-13T03:31Z,"we dont enjoy them, stop wasting our time."
,netselma,2010-01-20T17:02Z,"snaykbyt, this is not your own website!
Stop being that rude!
There are other people who are interested for sure!
Get a JOB!"
,Dingman,2010-02-03T06:41Z,"Please seed if you like the programs.  I have been uploading these classes to thousands of people from all over the world over the last 2 years, and it can be very slow for them without the help of other seeders.

Thanks for your help, and God bless you too."
,thunderbum,2010-10-17T22:45Z,"Dingman - although I can appreciate what you're trying to do, the fact of the matter is that UCG and other splinter groups went right off the rails as far as doctrine goes. UCG's two commissions are not the same ones as WCG's when they were on track. The only group that does not compromise on doctrines and the two commissions (including Mt 24.14) is the Restored Church of God.... (thercg[DOT]org).

The other big departure from doctrine is the voting of presidents, etc which is not Scriptural; Leon Walker has been booted out, and there is as much politics within the ministry as there are 'in the world' - of which we are enjoined to 'come out of her my people'.

If you are a member of the UCG, you'll know what I'm saying is true. To any others reading this: I'm not going to engage in a flame war with you, period.

Whatever happened to the hierarchy as delineated in in Titus, and Timothy? The real Government of God is not within the UCG because it's from the bottom up rather from the top (God) down.

Please understand it is not my intent to anger you or embarrass you. If you are a converted, baptized member then you would understand the phrase: iron sharpens iron. And as such I would ask you to visit our website and request the information package for those with a WCG background."
