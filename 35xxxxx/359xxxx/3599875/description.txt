these files are nameed and you should only use a sertine 1 per person depending on where they play. 

simpley download this folder and place it or copy it to

c:\program files\championship manager\saves

then simply start your game go into training click on create plan click on confirm thenclick on file just under create plan and import 1 of the files.do this each time for each file making sure you click on your coaches when u have imported the file.

now that you have set the scheduels set each players training to which scheduels they need you should soon see an improvment in there stats.

to see the stats improve click on a players name and where it says training change none to this week.

try and get the best coaches you can and only let the person you picked to train goalkeepers train goalkeepers.
