"She curses, she smokes, she breast-feeds and she blows away the competition. 
Just when you think Garth Ennis has gone too far, just when you thought it was 
safe to walk the streets, just when you thought no one would go near the idea of 
the world's first superhero prostitute...here comes The Pro! Reintroducing the 
outrageous story of The Pro in a deluxe oversized hardcover edition, plus an 
all-new, eight-page story by Garth Ennis, Amanda Conner and Jimmy Palmiotti! In 
"The Pro Meets The Ho," our plucky heroine comes up against a new and fearsome 
challenge: a super-powered "soiled dove" whose powers of perversion exceed the 
Pro's own! Find out who triumphs in this tussle of the tarts, as The Pro's 
creative team returns to the sticky-floored success that made them otherwise 
unemployable! You'll never go to the zoo again!"
