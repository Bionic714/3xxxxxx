,greenfrog,2007-02-17T02:23Z,"dont download!! there is absolutely NO SOUND last 20 minutes of movie.
Otherwise its a full DVD from (academy screener) with virtually perfect video and 5.1 audio.
But watching last 1/4 of movie on mute is NOT worth it.  
Otherwise is a quite good movie- reminded me of Last of the Mohicans"
