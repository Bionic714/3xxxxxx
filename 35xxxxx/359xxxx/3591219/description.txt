Here is a good collection of music from the pre-Christian world. Sound quality varies widely, but all is at least 320 kb:

Ambient Egypt -- New Age synthesizers mixed with ancient cymbals and string instruments. Not period correct, but very soothing.

Ancient Egypt -- a reconstruction of his ancestors' music by a renowned modern Arab musician.

Ancient Sumerians/Egyptians/Greeks -- a reconstruction of the few fragments of actual music that survived the ancient world, played on period instruments.

Ankh -- another interpretation of ancient Egyptian music and song.

Music from Ancient Rome -- this folder contains the tracks for both of Synaulia's CD's, one each for string and wind instruments.

Enjoy! And if you like what you hear, please do support the artists and buy the CD's!
