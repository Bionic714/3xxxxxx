Bear in mind this is my first-ever torrent, and it took an hours' worth of mucking around to get it created/published/seeded. If it just plain doesn't download, lemme know. If it does -- seed that sucker! And support the artists by buying some CD's!"

,Rivenshield,2007-01-07T04:25Z,"Thanks again (bows). 

So this link *does* work okay? even though all the seeders show up on the other...? Okay. Whatever works.  :D"

,nanaem,2007-01-07T07:32Z,"yep, this one works fine, i'm currently only at 66.5% but i can see your 100% seed. so it must be working perfectly."
