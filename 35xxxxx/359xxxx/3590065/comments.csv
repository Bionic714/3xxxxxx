,narf760,2007-01-08T05:21Z,"God this game looks so shitty, and to think all those years ago at my old eb-games I actually almost got this instead of half-life....."
,univibe69,2007-01-09T14:14Z,"so you aren't downloading and merely posted here to gratuitously share your wisdom? 
Please explain the relevance - to us - of your personal biases?
*First, learn the difference between a FPS and an RPG. - don't compare apples and oranges.
*Second, learn the meaning of the term ""Playability."" - Dungeon Siege LOOKED beautiful but I only ever played it once through - intellectually, it wouldn't challenge a 6 year old. 
- though if YOU get stuck, there is help on the web. ;-> 

an adage you might consider.
""It is better to remain silent and be thought a fool than to speak and remove all doubt."" "
,AqUit,2007-01-09T19:24Z,Its nice of you for put this up.. i had a bit problems before if u remember. Well i download i think it looks good. And you have right with the wisdom thing xD
,AqUit,2007-01-10T15:28Z,Behรถver man Dosbox?
,AqUit,2007-01-10T15:28Z,Wops Sorry i meen: DO you need dosbox?
,univibe69,2007-01-10T20:53Z,"No... it's a Windows game, runs on all versions.
Should run from a straight CD-ISO burn of the download - if I reburn my ISO it does fine.
Protection is minimal and easily beaten anyway.
(www.gamecopyworld.com)  At worst you can run it in Daemon Tools, free from the link.

It's a fully patched version that supports all the tools and Quest editor and there's an active support forum at http://forum.withingames.net/
-don't publicly ask about piracy issues though!"
,Mogymog,2007-01-12T01:10Z,"How do you get this game to install? I mounted it with D-tools, and then click enlighs language and install. But nothing happens, it just sits there untill I exit out. Anyone else got this problem?"
,univibe69,2007-01-13T05:44Z,"Not sure - the game will still install from a CD that fails validity tests, though in that case it won't let you play.
- It may be that you are not getting the intro videos.
Some codecs disappeared from XP after SP1 and one of the things affected is Darkstone. 
The ""  iv5setup  ""  from Indeo fixes that and MAY solve your hang. "
,Bleh,2007-01-31T04:01Z,"Shut up and read what univibe69 wrote
Stop complaining, this is a free download.
If you get it to work, sweet. If not, stop whineing. You just wasted a few hrs (not a signifacnt amount of money, you could've bought it) downloading free soft, pissing the rest of us off, listening to your whining."
,-IsKaldt-,2007-02-01T11:54Z,"Please seed. Theres no seeders and no downloaders except me.
