,Zeppelinfan1,2009-04-06T01:11Z,"Ya really, you should keep your comments about God/Jesus to yourselves. Also u should keep your comments about the movie to yourselves, these comments are mainly for quality of the torrent, and saying thanx to the uploaders. Thanx for this upload! :)"
,Seputinen,2009-11-17T11:27Z,"Thanks, very good movie, very  touching :) God Rules!"
,Adrian16807,2010-11-07T05:39Z,"Likewise, God Rules!
As for anyone else; if you don't like watching ""God this, God that"", in all honesty I am not sure why you would be watching a Christian film. God loves you all anyway though."
,RaZoRSZS,2011-02-04T18:35Z,Ok ppl...wavent seen d movie yet.....but i would have to agree with the latter.....just coz we r not christans does not give us the right to mock their religion!!.....ps..keep u're feeling to u're self!...
,iWorship_Jesus,2012-08-16T13:39Z,"I am proud to be a Christian and I'm not ashamed of it.
No matter what people would say, I will never change my mind. I love my God and I was born to save Him!"
