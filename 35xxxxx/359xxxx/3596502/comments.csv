,panyan,2007-10-27T15:27Z,actually after downloading and extracting and scanning multiple times it is not a virus and seems to a genuinely cracked version. but steamless versions of games do noot work - you have to have the official game - oh well!
,italianblaze,2007-11-08T06:13Z,"MSX security is no scam i use them all the time
fucking noob! but this cracked version will probably get u a vac ban because it isnt updated daily like msx securitys genuine version"
