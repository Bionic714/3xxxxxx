since there are no documents or folder names that refer to France VFR, I cannot guarantee 100% that this is in fact the France VFR mesh
however, the France VFR website states that their mesh file (I assume the download file) is 290 MB; all the .bgl files together are 284 MB
therefore I am assume that this is in fact the France VFR 38m mesh :-)

(ps, all freeware meshes for France on AVSIM are way of in filesize so..)
