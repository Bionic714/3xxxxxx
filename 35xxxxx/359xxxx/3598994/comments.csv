,krutan,2007-01-19T16:43Z,"The french .exe is included, it's not protected so it will not ask for a key when you start. However, since it not made for the english version you might get graphical bugs. I can't play the game for that reason, all the textures start blinking and flashing so you will become mad if you play it :D"
