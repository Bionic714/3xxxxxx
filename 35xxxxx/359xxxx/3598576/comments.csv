,majtymicke,2007-01-19T00:19Z,Nice! I hope that the older games will work with Win XP.
[T],Knaster,2007-01-19T00:55Z,I hate people that scream for seed the first thing they say. If i had uploaded it  i would take it down just the same.
,Astralia,2007-01-19T14:51Z,"yeh, does SW:DF II work under XP without any hassle?"
,xcrackox,2007-01-19T16:15Z,All games works on my Win XP SP2 Corp.
,lennart84,2007-01-20T02:16Z,Some people have problems running older Lucasarts games on Xp. To fix that just run it through the ScummVM emulator and that usually fixes it.
,nemurytorul,2007-01-20T20:41Z,how to install on xp? because doesn't install ... it's nothing happend
,Astralia,2007-01-24T14:49Z,ScummVM doesnt support JK2...the mousecontrol is *BEEPED* up but the rest works just fine....just need to find a way to fix the mousesteering.
,lordkhan,2007-01-24T17:07Z,Jk2 doesnt need some fuckin emulator lmao..
,Astralia,2007-01-24T19:04Z,"I know that! But i cant get the mousecontrol to act proper...i want it like this: Moving mouse up (from you) is viewing upwards and mouse towards you, view down but it doesnt work for some reason...."
,xcrackox,2007-01-24T20:17Z,"Download this file to add invert mouse settings:

http://cracko.250free.com/Jedi%20Knight%20-%20DFII.zip

Also, I rushed the compilation big time. You can only play the game with the original DFII JK discs. I've included a No-CD crack in the file above.

To have the movies played in the game, copy all the folder and files located in ""Jedi Knight - Dark Forces II\GAMEDATA\RESOURCE"" to your installed Jedi Knight RESOURCE directory.

Note that, since you have to update the game in order to use the no-cd crack, the unofficial patch won't work. It only works with 1.00 sadly... I'm not sure about the other Limit patch."
,Astralia,2007-01-25T05:37Z,Great....thanks alot dude!
,Astralia,2007-01-29T21:43Z,Sorry to sat but that mouse invert cfg didnt work at all :(

,Ridskog,2007-02-02T13:07Z,I Have a problem with that subsystem to. i have tried all kinds of diffrent cracks and patches but nothing seem to make a difference. Can someone find it in their heart and help me?
,xcrackox,2007-02-03T06:00Z,"For the invert settings to work, you have to load the configuration labeled 'Mouse Invert'.

The opengl error is not cdcrack related, since it did work fine for me. Make sure you choose full installation of the game."

I have tried alot of things to try to fix this. I have a feeling that it is something very obious. How do i see that i really installed it all? i have tryed diffrent Cracks and patches but nothing seem to change this problem. "
,xcrackox,2007-02-04T06:21Z,Try installing the latest video drivers for your card.
,Ridskog,2007-02-04T12:59Z,That sounds like a good idea!
,Ridskog,2007-02-04T13:35Z,"(ATI RAGE 128 PRO 6.13.3279) I've been scanning the whole of google, does anyone know a good website that has Drivers to download?"

,xcrackox,2007-02-05T19:59Z,I doubt that the ATI Rage cards are supported by Jedi Academy... it's a fairly old card.
,Ridskog,2007-02-05T21:01Z,So what should i do?
,Ridskog,2007-02-07T11:35Z,Get myself a new screen or a new card or both?
