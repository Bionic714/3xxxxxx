,treqo,2008-02-17T15:22Z,"crack isn´t necessary
1. Turn off PC disable your dvd/cd rom IDE
2.download starforcenightmare from here http://cdmediaworld.com/hardware/cdrom/cd_utils_8.shtml#StarForceClean%20/%20sfclean and click ''disable CD''
2.turn pc on, mount image file
3. and play"
,Bouncer1986,2008-02-21T18:48Z,"Mount LRC image with Daemon. MDS file must be without DPM. 
Launch LRC and when FrontLine is checking disk make ir to go on Not-Responding (press Cancel a lot of times and wait a minute). Then with Task Manager End protect.exe and lada.exe processes. 
Unmount image. Change used MDS with the one who has DPM (39kb). Mount image. Start the game without unplugging cd-roms.

If it doesn't work from the first time, remove old Starforce drivers, and then launch the game, it will install new drivers (you will need to reboot your pc). Maybe this way works with other versions of StarForce. This way doesn't work when you patch LRC to 1.01, because StarForce is also updated. On some computers disc checking is very fast and it is imposible to make StarForce to go on Not-Responding, to fix this you need to remove StarForce drivers and then install them with the game.
