Greetings from Denmark!"
,annorlunda45,2007-03-05T22:05Z,"@Pondus29

No, 1 part left of 1075. Wonder what would happen if you burn it anyway (or, if that does not work, try to reencode it somehow...) "
,Pondus29,2007-03-06T19:21Z,"Hi annorlunda45!

It`s the same here, 1 part left of 1075.

Think I´ll burn the movie now. Can´t wait.

,Kicklebury,2007-06-07T13:45Z,Tried burning in Nero after being stuck at 99.8% for a couple of weeks. I could watch the movie but there was a strange cut in the movie where the piece was missing and the subtitles got stuck there too so I had to turn off and on the subtitles to fix that.
