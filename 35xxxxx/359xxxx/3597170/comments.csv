,youngidealist,2007-08-27T09:09Z,"Well put JFK. 

Now I understand that there are many valid reasons to be upset at your government at this moment. what i don't understand is why there isn't yet an impeachment trial. Does anyone know why Democrats own the senate yet they don't attack Bush? Checks and balances are great when you use them. Why not this one yet?"

Here's a key piece to the puzzle.

,booognish,2008-12-23T01:44Z,"""that the Bush family is detrimentally tied to both the Saudi Arabian ruling elite and the American oil industry, with whom they trade influence and money for mutual benefit. Palast's investigations will stir the blood of any Democrat and may raise doubts in some Republicans""

Seems a little short sighted, every US president since Roosevelt in 1945 has been ""detrimentally tied to the Saudi Arabian ruling elite"" - 'protection for oil' essentially. Carter was the first president to deploy US troops to the middle east, in order to protect American oil interests in the region when the Ayatollah came to power in Iran in the late 70's. The Democrats and Republicans are two sides of the same coin. Obama will give Iraq at least three more years before giving up, and he's already pledged more troops in Afghanistan. He'll keep bashing away at that in the hope establishing basic stability, in order that the oil can efficiently flow in Uncle Sam's direction. He might give good rhetoric regarding his new energy plans, but he's clearly not putting all his eggs in that basket."
