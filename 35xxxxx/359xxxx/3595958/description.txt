Unprecedented: The 2000 Presidential Election
---------------------------------------------

Unprecedented: The 2000 Presidential Election is the riveting story about the battle for the Presidency in Florida and the undermining of democracy in America.  Filmmakers Richard Ray PÃ©rez and Joan Sekler examine modern America's most controversial political contest: the election of George W. Bush.  What emerges is a disturbing picture of an election marred by suspicious irregularities, electoral injustices, and sinister voter purges in a state governed by the winning candidate's brother.  George W. Bush stole the presidency of the United States? and got away with it. " ?the movie highlights those on the front lines ?from the African-Americans who were turned away from the polling booths for assorted reasons.  In one memorable scene the filmmakers freeze-frame a 'protest' against the ballot recount, identifying participants as staff members of Republican elected officials."
