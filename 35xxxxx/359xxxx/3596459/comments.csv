,NWE,2007-01-15T12:15Z,"MPAA Caught Uploading Fake Torrents - BSA spreading viruses?
Well, those lame ""viruses"" is no match for my antivirus..

http://torrentfreak.com/mpaa-caught-uploading-fake-torrents/

Come on they're trying to confuse us by telling there are viruses and telling us that there are NO viruses in the comments. Who cares? Download and see for yourself if your antivirus reports!

BSA/MPAA/RIAA/whoever (spammer) tactic:
1. Upload appz with virus
2. Spam TPB appz comments with ""virus warnings"" and fake statements, to confuse people.
3. Sink PirateBay(!)

Will it succeed? Hmm... At least I download and my antivirus checks, as usual. It is rather pathetic after all.."
,NWE,2007-01-15T20:25Z,"brownbilca - You're on the wrong person, I only use this name, and I only spam back on the pages with spam viruswarnings. So FUCK OFF and don't spam and upload viruses, leave TPB in PEACE, ASSHOLE(S)!"
,stevebux,2007-01-15T20:34Z,"Why do we have to put up with all the fucking dickheads on TPB, it's really pissing me off. Can't something be done about it? Everyone is being accused of uploading trojans and shit - all I can say is ignore the comments the twats leave, download and have your antivirus check it. All the spamming bastards - just fuck off and die."

,chaosbuster,2008-04-29T06:09Z,THE TOILET MAN!!! ... everybody go to hell ... shut the fuck up ... seed and go to hell
,kutalion,2008-08-04T15:05Z,NO SEED I CAN'T FUCKIN' DOWNLOAD... Big Deal the program can be found at cracksearchengine.net
,coolflip,2008-10-31T20:30Z,"Uhh, there is obviously somthing wrong here, because this is 3.34 mb, maby enough for about 10 sounds? My guess is fake"
,coolflip,2008-10-31T20:35Z,"ignore my last post, its probably an exe"
,GarglingGlass,2009-01-08T08:36Z,"Coolflip isn't cool, more like Droolflip. Slayer isn't a sample library, it is a generator. There are technically NO sounds. Fag.

Still, I think you're right..."
,sausagedog,2009-01-15T05:29Z,"bit rowdy on here arent we? tiolem, cheers matey"
,Sahtarah,2009-11-27T10:10Z,"coolflip, ReFX Vanguard is full of amazing presets and features and its less than 3 MB"
,galaxyworldwide877,2010-01-21T10:52Z,"WORKS PERFECTLY.  I AM USING IT RIGHT NOW IN FL STUDIO 8. QUICK DL EASY INSTALL AND CLEAN. THANK YOU TIOLEM. @THE NEWBIES: THIS TORRENT IS GOOD, THE PLUGIN WORKS GREAT. UNZIP IT AND DRAG THE .dll files INTO YOUR VST FOLDER IN C:PROGRAM FILES (THE NEW FOLDER YOU CREATED TO HOUSE ALL YOUR FX AND PLUGINS) REFRESH YOUR PLUGIN LIST IN FL STUDIO AND YOU'RE ALL SET"
,Terror-Freaker,2011-02-09T01:08Z,"@ galaxyworldwide877

Thanks for the description, it works perfectly for me and I'm using FL9 "
,severed1314,2011-02-15T22:49Z,It works but there is some weird clicking noise when you use. So in other word its useless...
,cyril19,2011-05-03T22:41Z,"It's really unbelievable how much completely useless comments are placed with torrents. I had to scroll all the way down and read all of the crap idiots left here to finally read a good description from galaxyworldwide877. Please comment on the program,utility movie or music instead of just wasting people's time. As far as the clicking sound, I think it might have something to do with the memory settings for fruity loops (I used to get clicking sounds with default settings and mass usage of vst-instruments and plugins).Increasing buffer lenght might fix it."
