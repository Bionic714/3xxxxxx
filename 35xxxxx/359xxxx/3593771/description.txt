TORRENT WARNING!!!  :  EXTREMELY IMPORTANT NOTE!!!  :  PLEASE READ THE MESSAGE!!!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Do *NOT* restart your computer directly AFTER the installation!!!
Make sure that you have *FULLY* çraçked the program. Then, do a system restart!
If you don't do that, the çraçk will NOT work, as has been reported by many!

This is the unreleased *BETA* version of ES3T N0D32, which means that it has
quite many *BUGS* in it and may cause system instability/crashes!!
It is designed for BETA TESTERS ONLY!!! USE IT ONLY ON YOUR OWN RISK!!!

For your own protections, use a packet-filterer to block anti-piracy 
organizations/companies to silently connect to your machine! They do this to 
file a law suit against you!!! For best protection, I recommend PeerGuardian 2.

>> INTRODUCTION >>

Today, I came up with a great idea: To share my favorite anti-virus software with you, mainly because I care about you and your machine. LOL. Nah, seriously, it's because it's very small, fast and yet secure. Very nice application, especially if you are a gamer. Also, if you're sick and tired of all these bloated "security" softwares from the "big guys" like Norton (Symantec) and McAfee (Network Associates), you should really give this one a try! 

Furthermore, I want to point out that for those of you who prefer optimal protection, here's [  http://www.wilderssecurity.com/showthread.php?t=37509  ]
a great tutorial, written by "Blackspear" (the gobal moderator of N0D32 Wilders Security Forum). This expert configuration will make sure that you don't see *any* alerts popping up when a threat has been found, while protecting your machine with a boosted protection. I personally recommend this tutorial to every hardcore NOD32 user because it brings efficiency to a higher level. 

Finally, here's a cool screenshot of the new up-coming software from Eset (it's currently under development) for the curious ones:

For further questions/thoughts on this subject, just drop a message or PM me. 
Also, I want to make it perfectly clear. IF you are a spammer/troller and enjoy posting false claims about torrents, or otherwise congest TPB's servers, 
I suggest that you leave this page IMMEDIATELY, for your security and for others'! 
Creds to all seeders and file sharers out there!

>> PRODUCT DESCRIPTION >>

ESET N0D32 Antivirus offers superior, comprehensive protection, the fastest scanning throughput, and the least performance impact of any solution. Keep your important information safe & stay productive with peace of mind. Running separate applications for viruses, hackers, adware, and spyware can slow your PC, be difficult to manage, and provide questionable protection. Beware of large, bloated internet security suites that consume hundreds of megabytes on your PC. 
These typically exist because vendors have acquired products and 'bundled' them together. In contrast, ESET N0D32 was designed from the core as a single, highly-optimized engine that works as a unified Anti-Threat system to protect against a broad spectrum of malware. Viruses, worms, spyware, and other malicious attacks, which are constantly evolving. ESET N0D32 utilizes patent-pending ThreatSense½ Technology to detect tomorrow's threats in real-time, by analyzing code execution for malicious intent - keeping you ahead of the malware-writers.
