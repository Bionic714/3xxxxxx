Apparently the channel it aired on cut a few mins out of each ep, its not noticable if you watch the ep though since they've done a pretty good job at it.

But anyways good work."

,pcGnome,2011-07-03T17:45Z,"Sadly, virtually EVERYONE (yes, you) hits & runs on this series. I've been keeping it seeded off and on for several years now and nobody else does.

Luckily, it is well worth watching, so I plan to continue my thankless task - for the series, not for you ""something for nothings"".
