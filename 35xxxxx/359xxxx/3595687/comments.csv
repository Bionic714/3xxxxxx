,deemans,2007-10-05T11:44Z,"I am using nero software as my burning tool but think I have done something wrong.  When burning the installation disk, do I burn it on a cd as a data disc.  Also do I burn it in ISO mode(whatever this means). Please help.

,GoLyEth,2007-11-05T08:41Z,Thanks. Works perfectly
,Charonne,2007-12-10T21:35Z,"Sorry. I feel like an idiot, but I can't figure out what to do with the files. I extracted all the files and burned them to a DVD. I can start the program but it can't find the language files. Any advice you can offer? Thanks!"
,S0iLw0Rk,2008-01-06T00:37Z,"Charonne-  Download the program ""PowerISO"" and when the torrent download is complete, it should open up as an ISO file.  Then all you have to do is click ""Burn"" on the PowerISO Program.

There is a torrent & keygen for PowerISO on this site,

Hope that helps."
,James2020,2008-01-19T00:27Z,I cant burn the entire Italian 1 and 2 on a sigle disk and powerISO wont break it up???  What now.. please help THANKS!
,tasty_cake,2008-01-27T19:40Z,"Cheers for this! Its much needed...
BUT can anyone tell me if these are language packs for V2 or V3 Rosetta stone? You need to make sure that you're using the right version of the application or the packs won't work ;("
,Biscuits4cheese,2008-02-04T05:31Z,"missuna If you're still having problems simply go to http://www.bitlord.com and click the 'Download BitLord v.1.1 Stable version' link  and follow the instructions for installing it on your pc. once you've done this, any torrent you select to download will then be handled by your bitlord client (by the way no matter what other people say, bitlord is by far the MOST comprehensive and tidy free client available today. A seed is the person(s) who have the file(s) to share with (upload to) other people who download them Any further probs drop me a line at tonymontana813@googlemail.com 

Th3Moos3 Thanx for the upload mate, much appreciated :)"

,KarelRei,2011-06-21T21:24Z,"Where is a disk for English.
I have tried other disks but Rosetta Stone
doesn't recognize them (although the computer reads them).
Don't you have an English ISO, or what should I use?"
