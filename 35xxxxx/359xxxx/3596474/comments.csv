,unloosed,2007-01-22T02:37Z,"Kaspersky, NOD32, and Trend Micro are all better products anyway.  

No offense purrty, but Norton has been proven time and time again to be worse in almost all forms of protection then the other three listed above.  "

,Cheezez,2007-02-06T14:43Z,"to gormdengamle:
Antivirus isnt protection against hackers!
Its protection against virus-threats. Protection against hackers is called a Firewall. 
Norton is very good, but takes a lot of cpu and can be a real bitch sometimes. Other progs are therefore recommended. "
