,NooK,2007-01-09T18:48Z,OK. This is no fucking virus. Stop with the bullshit. It is (Apparently not the latest anymore) Skype executable 3.0.0.190 which I uploaded for a friend who cannot install skype on the pc he is using to remove just the executable to use portably on a usb memory.
,NooK,2007-01-09T19:03Z,"Yes but you cannot get just the executable from sky.com. You have to download the installation program, install it somewhere and then get the executable and some people might not be able to di that. Anyway I dont evem know why I am arguing anymore, those who want it fell free to get it. It has no virus nor any other kind of crap. Remember to run with the /dapapath and /removable parameters to get portabillity."

,Skywalker & Yoda,2007-01-09T21:58Z,"Thanks Nook, and i can confirm no virus on this.
i would pretty much say i know what i am talking about i have had computer since the first Vic20 so thats 26 years.
It is just the true skype.exe file you get after installing skype. you can copy it to anywhere on the HD and re-install windows, and then start this skype.exe from the location you copy it to. with out have to reinstall skype again. it is a stand alone program, get it! :)"
