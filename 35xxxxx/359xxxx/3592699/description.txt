DURAN DURAN - Seven And The Ragged Tiger (Remastered) FLAC








This was the first Duran Duran album i ever heard way back in 1984 and have loved their music ever since. This was the last studio album the original band line-up recorded before Roger and Andy Taylor left a fews years later, and then returned more than 20 years later for the 2004 "Astronaut" album.


This remastered version sounds just as good (if not better) now, as it did over 20 years ago !!!!
