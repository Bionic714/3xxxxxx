,Karl Mundt,2007-01-12T15:50Z,Thank you very much
,agentshags,2007-01-12T18:40Z,"Your welcome. I apologize for the speed, but all I have is a shared DSL connection. I live out in BFE (the country) and this is all we can get out here. We are lucky to have that because for about four years before DSL, all they had to offer us was slow ass dial-up. I can promise to keep seeding though. Stick with this torrent and eventually it will be complete. 

patience is a virtue."
,Philosogogue,2007-02-07T18:02Z,Seed. Four days at 99.88%.
,ursule,2007-02-14T12:38Z,"I guess I'm late, only 54% is availbble, those who completed it already left :("
,sosofake,2007-02-18T11:37Z,reseed.
,agentshags,2007-02-27T23:53Z,"this torrent is NOT completed yet, has NOT been to 99.88% yet and is STILL SLOWLY SEEDING. Right now [feb 27th, 2007 @ 4:45 central time USA] uTorrent is showing 77.7% complete for my peers, and is showing 95 leechers. So fucking god damnit, out of 95 people, I expect at least 1/4 of them to seed this after its uped. ONCE AGAIN ITS  77.7% DONE AND STILL SEEDING!"
,stigvige,2007-03-01T20:38Z,"I'm stuck on 78,7%....pls. hang'on. Ă&#x153;torrent said: time out; is there anybody outhere?"
,glassyeyed,2007-03-02T14:54Z,"Yes, please keep seeding, would love to see this one. Thanks."
,EFFECTSmoothOperator,2007-03-14T06:50Z,"I'm trying to help

My friend here ""agentshags"" just might be too much of a noob to know that he can't upload a 8.3 gig file with his 25 kB/s upload cap in under ten years.

With this in mind, I went and got a copy of this file and I am in the process of trying to help him seed. 

I too have a similarly shitty 45 kB/s upload rate so this is still gonna take some time. 

I might drop off for a while sometimes, but I will return to keep seeding as I can.

Be patient, you will get there in time and I promise not to give up on this while it's still in need.

,claes1,2008-01-23T22:18Z,Disk #1 works well but disk #2 doesnt work at all. After 4194 MB it stops and says that the device is full although there is 32 GB free space.
,agentshags,2008-02-15T03:11Z,"anyone else had this problem?

I might have to redo this torrent somehow idk its pretty huge. its suposed to be one dvd 5 and one dvd 9 so i shrunk the second with dvd shrink. any experts that can tell me a better idea? I could .rar the whole thing in bite size bits, perhaps."
,agentshags,2008-03-30T09:24Z,"If you like cartoons or are waiting for me to mess with this torrent more, your better off going to TTOKTV.COM and registering, Then politely  responding in the ""offers"" category, in my ""Max Fleischers Color Classics"" thread. Perhaps with enough of a fan base I would be encouraged to do some XviD/MP3 Rips of the entire (save for one) COLOR CLASSICS collection. . .

TTOKTV.COM for all your kids tv needs!

,agentshags,2008-04-19T23:08Z,"So, the XviD rips are done and up, so visit ttoktv.com for them today!"
