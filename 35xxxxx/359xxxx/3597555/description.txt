This is the CD-ROM of the World Bank World Development Indicators, edition 2005. 
This data covers over 600 data series for more than 200 countries and more than 40years. 

It includes a search program with export to excel/openOffice and simple mapping software. 

It is a scandal that this data is highly expensive (several hundered US$) and thereby not really accessible to poor NGOs and private people.
