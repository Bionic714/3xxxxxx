German phonebook from end of 2006 as SQL-dump

This is approximately 2,7 GB large (uncompressed).

The database includes the following fields:
| id            | int(11)    |      | PRI | NULL    | auto_increment | 
| nachname      | text       |      |     | NULL    |                | 
| vorname       | text       |      |     | NULL    |                | 
| suffix        | text       |      |     | NULL    |                | 
| branche       | text       |      |     | NULL    |                | 
| strasze       | text       |      |     | NULL    |                | 
| plz           | text       |      |     | NULL    |                | 
| ort           | text       |      |     | NULL    |                | 
| internet      | text       |      |     | NULL    |                | 
| telefonnummer | bigint(20) |      | MUL | 0       |                |
Not all fields may be filled with really useful content, but most contain at least a proper telephone number.

You could use this for data-mining or a *really* fast reverse-lookup running at your own server/workstation at home ;-).
