Thnx a bunch."
,zoneone,2007-01-21T03:43Z,"This one is cool.
It's the spanish original, made _before_ the Tom Cruise movie ""Vanilla Sky"" with basically the same story.
Funny that PenĂŠlope Cruz is in both movies. :)"
,Chimairo,2007-01-25T13:33Z,"AH strangely enough.. i havent seen ""vanilla sky"" hehe.. thats wierd. I guess ive never been interested i finding out what it was about.  

Now i know... So.. its basically a ""abre los ojos"" ripoff. hmm.. what an american thing to do. hehe"

yes we have all the money :) but really china owns most of it in treasury bills"
,Cain303,2008-07-17T18:11Z,Is the director commentary subtitled in English?
,Cain303,2008-07-31T09:19Z,"Answering my own question: The commentary is NOT subtitled. Also, the VIDEO_TS folder is not decrypted properly so it has to be done if you plan on burning it to disc."
,loop09,2008-11-19T11:14Z,How do you decrypt the folder? Can someone name a software or whatever it takes to burn it to disc?

Dear keerkegan

Could you please seed/upload the complete torrent of ""Pirates of the Caribbean - The lost disc"" at least once then I will seed it for a min of 2 years(& forever if I upgrade my 120gb hard drive.)

I know that this torrent was made in 2006,but even now there are more than 12 people including me who are all stuck at "" 64.1% "" (I have been waiting for over a month & a half , only then I decided to post this comment.)
We require just 1 seeder for just a couple of days, thats all !! just for a couple of days !!

Please !!! This is a potc special disc and should be available to all the pirates forever, it should not die down so soon(This is the only torrent that has this special disc, hence much more the importance of seeding it)

If you would seed it at least once more then many people, including me would be grateful to you


PS : I have posted this comment on all your torrent detail sections. If you have read this then please ignore it and sorry for bothering you everywhere  :P"
