,McPorra,2007-01-18T02:46Z,Thanks 4 the up
,up4anything,2007-01-18T18:04Z,"Thanks much for this! If you would like help distributing these, PM me. I have great upload speed. Thanks again!"
,HangLoose,2007-01-18T20:09Z,"Thanks ! very many times, again & again. i promise i'm gonna seed a bit moore than 200%, or forever."
,runjohan,2007-01-19T11:16Z,please seed more! :)
,HangLoose,2007-01-19T23:04Z,"I hope you rip the other ones a little moore carefully, some of the lessons on this is cut at the end , i think just before end,  not very serius problen only not perfect. thanks again"
,HangLoose,2007-01-19T23:52Z,"something about 2 or 3 lessons is cut just in the beginning, talking and picture out, and it jump to next clickable menu.  bad picture quality too."
,HangLoose,2007-01-20T00:01Z,"Thanks anyway, picturequality works for the flight-scool."
,HangLoose,2007-01-20T07:48Z,"I'm feeling bad for my complain, it was really only one lesson that clip's at the start (when she start pointing at ? and talking about ? clip-out) very fast no time to se what.
 the other just clips in the last word i think."
,Roscoe91,2007-01-21T09:42Z,"You should feel bad for complaining HangLoose.  I see I waisted my time burning & uploading something that cost me over $300 to share with others while you feel the need to complain.  Why don't you go buy the rest of the DVDs and finish distributing it for free.  Sorry guys but I'm pissed and don't feel like uploading the rest anymore, later."
,HangLoose,2007-01-21T20:59Z,"Sorry my comment was only to inform you of the misstake i think you did when you ripped this to the iso, maybe you want to know before you make the next, thougt you did'nt know about it, but my english is no good. so i write it here wrong 3 times to mutch."
,meu56th,2007-01-22T01:59Z,"Thanks for the seeds Roscoe91, its very sad that some one thinks they have the right to complain. 

Sorry to hear you will not be seeding the rest of the set, I was enjoying watching them, they make Flight Sim 2004 much more fun when you learn what things mean. I wish I could spend $300 to get the rest of this set, but Im still at school and don't like the idea of becoming a drug dealer to feed my flight sim addiction.. :-/

Thanks a lot HangLoose, you moron, you must buy this and finish the seed now, this is your fault !!! Grrrrr..."
,HangLoose,2007-01-22T08:54Z,"I'm sorry for the outcome, but my intention was to help him (it's not fun to look thru all the dvd's, before ) , and he talking about huw to figure out how to ripp dhem down or something before this dvd, 
my meaning was not to complain, but whith my bad writing english i suddenly se that it look's like that, and i use the word,
now when he stop i delöete the whole thing and stop too.
Misstake but i'm not going to learn to be pilot , i'm a kite-windsurfing-freak."
,HangLoose,2007-01-22T16:57Z,"I en rättebång tror jag man har rätt att uttrycka sej på sitt eget språk (med en tolk som missförstår, förstås)
Jag ger upp engelskan det blir bara missförstånd, kan inte uttrycka mej på det språket.
jag trodde att han skulle bli glad att bli informerad om att inte rippen funkade helt på den här dvd'n,(vissa småfel). Så han kan ändra settings innan han rippar resten, vem vill seeda så många gig av något som inte funkar 100%. (och sen kanske seeda om en dvd som misslyckats) (lite jobbigt att spela igenom hela rippen för att kolla att den funkar, när man kan titta på orginalet) jobbet är att seeda, rippar gör man en gång, och då vill man ha ett ex som man själv är glad för (jag trodde att han kommit över dom tillfälligt och passade på att dra ner dom) och samtidigt dela med sej.
Ganska tråkigt att skriva något här på engelska(som inte går att redigera) och sen när man lagt in rättning efter rättning upptäcker att det ser ut som jag klagar, jag hade faktiskt också varit glad för dvd 3 (även om rippen inte va perfect) den innehåller lite metreologi (väderfenomen) som jag är intresserad av.
jag har seedat denna nästan 300% och dom andra över 200%.innan jag raderade.
Tänkte seeda mer när det behövs. upprätthålla ration för något vettigt bl,a."
,up4anything,2007-01-23T21:24Z,"WOW! The guy seems like he was just trying to help and there was some confusion of intent due to the language barrier. 

Seems like a tad much to get spun up about. I can help you encode and seed if you want. 

Anyone else that is interested in stuff like this, send me a message and we can trade some material and make sure everyone can get it."
,Roscoe91,2007-01-24T04:22Z,"I understand he may have come off wrong due to the language barrier but at least he could have said which lessons with a time stamp so I could verify if it was the burn or my DVDs or if it was just him.  I used DVD decrypter to make the ISO which a pretty full proof one button operation to burn.  If I knew where the problems is, maybe I can check the DVDs to see if something is wrong.  If it was the burn I could have put a V2 out but unless he tells me exactly where its at, I don't have the time to check every lessons as there are alot."
,up4anything,2007-01-24T18:45Z,"Nah. I wouldn't worry about it mate. I think everyone would probably rather have the rest of the DVDs than to worry about one or two glitches here and there.

I like DVD Decryptor, it's nice - especially when you use it with DVD shrink. You migt even be able to shrink each DVD down to a GB or so and more people would be able to help seed faster.

Anyway, my help is here if anyone wants it. 

And thanks againn, I think it's great that some of us ""poorer"" pilots can get in on aviation. It's rediculous what these things cost.

Cheers!"
,aviator365,2007-10-03T08:09Z,Thanks a lot Roscoe.  This is so helpful.  Do you happen to have a copy of the instructor signoff sheet so I can take the test?
,Ragnarok86,2008-03-31T13:34Z,Thank you so much for the uploads!
,snowcat24,2008-11-17T09:03Z,"If you want the DivX version, it's part of the master collection I posted. Thanks to Roscoe91 for providing the originals!
