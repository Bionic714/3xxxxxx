Also, this is what text is showing up as in some of my applications.

Don't install all the fonts.
The more fonts you install, the more memory they take, cause they will be loaded as the OS is loaded. Only install the fonts you need. Consider using a font manager. 

Don't use any installer that comes with a particular font or font-collections.
Many times those ""installers"" contains and installs a spyware/adware, or even a trojan/virus if your unlucky. Free stuff from the Internet ain't so free as you might think it is.
Extract and install the font files by your own by simply copy the fonts themselves to the font directory in your system, for example C:\Windows\fonts.

If a font is packed within an EXE-file, then consider it to contain spyware/adware and other stuff aswell that gonna annoy you with random popups about Viagra and such things. Happened to me when I tried out a few fonts from the ""free fonts here, hohoo!"" -sites that was pcked within a self-extracting EXE-file

Good luck"
,pashe,2007-07-19T11:37Z,"Yeah, installing thousands of fonts is a good way to make the os really run buggy. I'd recommend to use a font manager, such as Linotype FontExplorerX (free, win & mac)

With a font manager, you can activate fonts you need at the moment, and deactivate them if you do not need them. "
