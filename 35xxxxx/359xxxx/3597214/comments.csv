[T],stevekasian,2007-01-16T19:48Z,"lol - Hey all, I'm having problems with my ISP... they cropped up the instant I UL'd this torrent... great timing there, eh?
So if there's no seed connected, don't worry - I'll get there asap.

,FSSR.Keyno,2007-01-16T21:48Z,LFPB isnt working for me. FS9 freezes on loading at 11% on Active rwy. I have FlightParisBase and Autogen installed. I think the rip needs more info on how to install to be compatible with FranceVFR.
,Panodilo,2007-01-16T21:58Z,Can anybody share Casino Glamour.iso please? Got real paid at work today and I wanna give it to some asshole in Macau.
,Dr. Frikadel,2007-01-16T22:07Z,"Verarsche Casino Glamour.iso!! 

Req: FranceVFR 38m Mesh. Never ever seen that anywhere...:(

,4X-AXG,2007-01-16T23:46Z,"patience my german friend
the France 38m mesh will be uploaded in about an hour from now"
,4X-AXG,2007-01-17T00:51Z,"Keyno:

well I think the manual should give more information about that..it just says 'compatibe with France VFR bla bla bla'..not really the fault of the guy who ripped this I think"
[T],stevekasian,2007-01-17T04:24Z,"FSSR.Keyno: Just FYI, I've installed both of these and used them with no problems. I can't, however, tell you what other add-ons I had active at the time. I've been using only N. American sceneries for the last 6 months or so, and I've forgotten what all I have installed on my Euro scenery.cfg.

[T],stevekasian,2007-01-17T04:28Z,"... also, I obtained these as-is from TPB over the last year. Rest assured that whenever I am aware of any combatibility/issue info. on one of my uploads, I will always include it either in the archive as a readme or in the download header.

,NZ01,2007-10-28T02:55Z,Could somebody share please
,darealgege,2008-02-26T11:01Z,"i have the same issue as FSSR.Keyno. fs usually freezes at 11%, just when im loading in france. i have all france vfr packs. but if im change the loading order of FRVFR packs in scenery library it will work for a short period. then its freezes at 11% again. then i must play with loading order again, and it will work for a short time again."
,Crashdive,2008-11-23T07:48Z,"Thanx 4 the up, Steve
