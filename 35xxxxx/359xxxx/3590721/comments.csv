,rascelon,2007-01-06T07:46Z,This is the pilot episode
,blackleotard,2007-01-08T09:00Z,"Oh, it'll definitely last a whole season because (a) UK TV shows have much shorter seasons, and (b) they tend to finish making the whole season before broadcasting it."
,skoobydubie,2007-01-17T20:51Z,Just for kids? I am thirty and I really enjoyed this show. It definitely has that Who quality. I will be watching this show for sure. Please keep putting them up so those of us around the world can get this one. Thanks.
,lysandra,2007-02-28T21:56Z,"Thank you!  This will definitely last for some seasons.  It's a great show, and just like Dr. Who.  Targeted at kids, but designed for adults to enjoy as well.  Plus, everyone loves Sarah Jane, which is why they chose to make a spin-off based on her instead of the original idea of Dr. Who as a kid."
,dave_f,2007-06-01T15:56Z,"This is not the pilot.  There is no pilot.  The Beeb picked up the show for a season without a pilot, they were so sure it would get good ratings.  What this is is a Xmas special (coming before a season, instead of after)."
