,wikberget,2007-01-14T23:57Z,"Demkas, you should be able to use this one on the US version aswell, as long as you change the realmlist.wtf file to the US version."
,isheh,2007-01-15T00:04Z,You can only install to engbclient with a engb patch(TBC) and then swap the exes and relmlist to make it work on a us version. I think this would work if someone uploaded the enus installer.exe
,pafp,2007-01-15T00:21Z,"not able to install on enUS wow, says not compatible"

,xzczxcxzcxzczxc,2008-03-21T22:10Z,"If you have the US client, like me, you first have to g oto your World of Warcraft directory (default C:/Program Files/World of Warcraft)
go to the folder named data and double click.
Inside theres a folder named ""enUS"".
change the name to ""enGB"".
Then double click the folder.
Inside you will find a lot of files. Change all places it says US to GB (backup-enUS-->backup-enGB)
After ALL these files are renamed, run the installer.
Now it works :)"
