Here is Polyester, John Waters' first move from indie cult, low budget film into the "main stream". Starring Divine and Tab Hunter, this outrageous film depicts Divine as a huge housewife with an overactive sense of smell. The movie was released in "Odorama" (this is explained in the movie's introduction) Her deranged son is addicted to PCP and has a mad fetish for stomping on random women's feet, while her slut of a daughter "dances for boys at school" for a quarter. Edie is also here, playing, of all things, a 60 year old ex toilet cleaner who has inherited a large sum of money, and becomes a debutante! This really is a must-have for cult collectors.

Enjoy, and again, please SEED when you're done!
