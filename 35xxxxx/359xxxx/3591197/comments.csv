,gemma_gemma,2007-02-10T15:19Z,"Hi! I'm new and utterly clueless but I would like to watch my downloads on a normal dvd (i.e on telly :). So far I've only managed to watch the .avi - format, and only on my computer (I have mac OSX). xvid-lol and xvid-xor, xvid-tv, what does all that stand for? And how do I get it to work in a normal DVD? Would be REALLY grateful for some hints!"
