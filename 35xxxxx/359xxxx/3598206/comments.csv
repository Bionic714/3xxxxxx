1 - Install TMPGEnc 4 Xpress Trial

    TE4XP_Trial_4.2.3.193_setup_en.exe


2 - Copy Folder ""Pegasys Inc"" to C:\Documents and Settings\user\Application Data\

    (This will install the licence key)


3 - Move those both .exe files in your install dir:

    TMPGEnc4XP.exe
    TMPGEnc4XPBatch.exe

4 - It is done. :) Launch TMPGEnc4XP.exe and enjoy :)


(.lic File works for German & English vers.)

I've done this exactly and it works for me. Now I can delete my old TMPGEnc XPress 3.

Thanks to the releaser :) Good work guys !! :) Clap-Clap :)"
,xboxhueg,2007-01-31T15:41Z,"was it too painful for you to include the fucking retail exe for when they no longer offer it for download on their site you mongoloid stupid fuck? for now when the exe is still available on their site, anyone who uses a decent bt client can choose not to download the exe if they have half a brain. what about when it's not available anymore? what would this torrent be good for? for letting people search all over for that specific fucking exe? god."
