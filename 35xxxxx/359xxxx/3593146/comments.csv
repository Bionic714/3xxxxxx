,penol738,2007-01-10T15:37Z,"awesome action game, but the first game is waaaay more scary, and a lot better"
,Yaaraer,2007-01-10T17:07Z,"It's too bad the first one isn't supported on many GeForce-cards with newer drivers anymore, leaving many players with the second game as the only option. I think it's sad they didn't keep the cooperative/skirmish mode in the sequel, which was really intense and perfect when you were a few guys too short to play tdm.

Great game anyhow!"
,Malak,2007-01-16T13:25Z,"When I try to install the expansion it reaches 90% and then I get a component transfer error in \updates\avp2_us_092.exe. I tried downloading it again, same results. Any ideas?"
,jucke9,2007-01-18T18:39Z,very good seeding...kepp it up :D
,Yaaraer,2007-01-22T16:05Z,"Malak: Do you use the installation of core-AvP2 in this torrent or another? I believe there were a US and a EU version of the game.. and as the file implies there might be something with the ""us"" part of the file name.

I haven't heard of the error before so I really don't know what is causing it, but everyone I know using these (core and expansion) have got it working."
,Yaaraer,2007-02-13T11:18Z,"Wow, more than 1000 completed downloads in just a little more than a month! Pretty good for a 5 year old game, i think. Keep seeding it, so there will be at least one copy of this game still up in the torrent world. Haven't checked out the availability of AvP1 (Gold version), but if there is interest I can get that up here too."

,Shobub,2007-02-23T08:28Z,I Cant Mount Primal Hunt ..!! Why?!:.It Says; Error In Command Line...Help..
,Yaaraer,2007-02-26T18:08Z,"Abstrakt_85: använd ett cd/dvd-mount-program, exempelvis Daemon Tools och ladda in AvP 2 Primal Hunt Expansion.bin i detta. Autostartar inte skivan, så leta upp den i Den här datorn och den extra optiska enheten som Daemon Tools skapat. Installera sedan expansionen - det är bara att klicka sig igenom den, så vitt jag minns. När du är klar med det, leta upp mappen Razor1911 på skivan och kopiera PrimalHunt.exe till den mapp du installerade expansionen i. Ersätt den original-exen med samma namn. Sedan borde det inte vara några problem att få det att funka!

Shobub: I have no idea what the problem is. I use Daemon Tools 3.47 and have no issues mounting any of the discs in this torrent. Okey, when I mount the expansion disc, it says ""Wrong disc inserted"" but that's all and doesn't affect the use of it. Try this program if you're using another, but other than that I really don't know. I also use WinXP Pro SP2, don't know if this game runs under Vista. GL!"
,darkhell,2007-03-17T12:36Z,"Ok Yaaraer vad har jag gjort fel
Jag började med att Mounta Cd1.iso  gick till den här datorn & valde utforska Cd1 samt valde setup.exe den installerade spelet till 52% Mountade då Cd2 klickade på ok & den installerade resten dvs  Mountade cd1 igen & klicka på ok
sen efter detta måste jag ha gjort något fel

Jag har prövat att kopiera AUTORUN.EXE dvs filen i mapp 2 & klistrade in denna i mappen som skapades när spelet installerades dvs ersatte befintlig fil med denna  men detta måste ju ha varit helt fel eftersom liret aldrig startar
har Mountat både Cd1 & 2 å försökt att lira men det går inte
har även varit inne i Zipfilen & dubbelkli på avp2.exe  får då fram en ruta om jag vill lira el gå te options mm  väljer play väljer även om jag vill tex ha low-high grafik men får då fram
Error unable to find avp2.rez file   så något fel har jag ju gjort  så jag bara undrar  vart ligger cracken el vad ska jag göra   det var ett tag sen man höll på med sånt här
tackar för all hjälp....."

,Nakoniko,2007-10-12T15:16Z,i downloaded just the expansion and i cant install it. what is .bin file? my computer wont want to open .bin files :(
,Ryttinge,2007-11-04T17:28Z,cd-key?
,Yaaraer,2007-11-25T19:07Z,"Nakoniko:

You need a program to emulate the disks (a.k.a. the .bin files, which is a format comparable to .iso or .img). I recommend Daemon Tools. Go to http://www.daemon-tools.cc/dtcc/download.php?mode=ViewCategory&catid=5 and download it. Install the program and when you have it started, click its icon in the activity bar and choose ""Mount...."". Find the .bin file and press OK, and you'll probably have it autorun as a normal optical disc; if not, kick up winexplorer and browse to DT's image drive among your other optical drives, and find the setup! GL m8!

Ryttinge:

Everything to run the game is included in the torrent. Just download, mount and install as every other image game out there!"
,Yaaraer,2007-11-25T19:10Z,"DCFGS3:

No idea about this. Perhaps you should try it with DT instead, as it's the optical media emulation I use and got it going with. Or, you could make a checksum on the torrent to see that you got it all down and in good shape."

,traceadkins1234,2008-02-06T01:49Z,"Works just fine for me. You have to apply the crack before you try to run it. If you don't , you will have to uninstall, and delete its folder in program files and start over...

Start game.2.) enter invalid/old Cd key3.) Exit game and start it up through gamespy.4.) Kick some assThis let me play my brother on my copy of avp2 but i aint got primal hunt so apolagies if it dont work with the expansion.""

First off I updated the game to version 1.0.9.6 and found another crack, then I went to muliplayer within AVP, entered my key in off the net, it said ""Checking with Servers"" (or something like that), then I chose a server and started playing!  Wicked!

mount the first CD, run the setup, and when it asks for the second CD, unmount CD1 and mount CD2 (just like swapping out real CDs) into the exact same drive.  It will finish installing and ask for CD1 again.  So swap back to CD1.

that should do it."

If your having a problem with the file avp2_us_092.exe

go to http://aliensvspredator2.filefront.com/file/AvP2_Update_1092;1065#Download and download the 1.0.9.2 patch

put it in the updates folder in the avp2 folder on your desktop

Tried this with the original .exe shortcut both with and without disc image mounted.

,DeadlyAsparagus,2009-05-24T09:00Z,"woot, i got it! Once you've mounted and installed AvP2, instead of clicking on the shortcut that was created via installation, use the one that came when you downloaded it. It opens up like a settings window, and you can click 'play' from there.

It should say something about not being able to find the avp.rez file so you need to put it in the AvP directory in Program Files. Voila!"

Ok now, when you finished downloading the game you will want to extract the files( Iso files) with 7zip. when you locate the files right click them and you will see the 7zip>, then click extract files. It should extract the files in the same location as the files you started with and have a folder for each cd (CD1 and CD2)  you will have to extract both CD Iso files. after that you will want to open the cd 1 folder. then you will see things like setup, Auto run and all that good stuff in the folder. At the top you will see the crack folder. Open it and drag and drop the contents over to the left to folder CD1. A window will pop up with the choice of ""move and replace. Choose that!!!! next step, Mount the cd 1 by right clicking on the daemon tools icon on the bottom right side of your computer screen toolbar. It should look like a lighting bolt with a circle around it. after you right click it you will see virtual cd/dvd-rom. move your cursor up to that and you you will see the mount image choice. Choose that and browse for the CD1 iso file. When you find the file mount it. Then do the same process again. So all together mount the CD1 iso file twice!!!! Don't ask me why but it works. Ok now you will go back to the original CD1 extracted folder (not the iso file) Run the Setup application at the bottom of the folder. Oh and to make it easier you can drag the data3 file from CD2 extracted folder to the CD1 folder, this keeps you from having to mount CD 2 iso file when it ask you for it during installing process. Now run the Setup. you will go through the install process and it will ask you to install Directx8. choose cancel and it will ask you to register this game online, choose cancel again. Then choose the create shortcut box then there you are. once the desktop shortcut shows up then you can play the game. Also leave the Cd1 mounted cause you won't be able to play the game unless it is mounted! For the Expansion, you will use the free program called Bin2Iso to convert the Bin file you received in this download to a Iso file like Cd1 and Cd2. After that you will want to find a No cd torrent for this game and download it before doing anything else. Once you have downloaded the no cd patch and extracted it using 7zip like before you will want to extract the Iso file (Primal hunt bin) you converted. It will bring another folder up just like CD1 and Cd2. It will have the same kind of info in the folder (for example the setup application, data1, data2, auto run, and etc.) You will want to drag the extracted no cd patch file to this folder. Again it will ask you to""move and Replace"" choose this!!!!this keeps you from having to mount the primal hunt cd (which does not work cause it will say wrong disk inserted). go back to the original folder (Primal Hunt extracted folder) then run the setup application. You will go through the same install process as cd 1 and cd 2. It will ask you to install some directx program. choose cancel. I can't remember if it ask to register or not but if it does just choose cancel. when you get to the create shortcut box choose it. then choose finish. Woot Woot you are done!!! The reason i posted this is because I spent countless hours on google trying to figure out how to do this. So this is for the people that don't how to install this game and for the people that do and were to lazy to explain on here how! but if this helps please send your appreciation or any questions via email at yohahn8475@hotmail.com Peace!!"
,PainDriven8555,2009-10-06T20:52Z,Also when i said to mount CD1 twice. That meant to Mount it on drive [F:] again! (leave it mounted on drive [F:] the first time and then mount it on drive [F:] the second time! another thing when you mount the image it will bring up a window that says! run setup or open folders just hit the red X in the corner! 
,Schimmel_L3,2009-12-10T19:23Z,THX A LOT PainDriver8555!!! At first i didn't got IT XD...
,PainDriven8555,2010-01-13T08:13Z,Hey just wanted to say sorry to those of you who sent emails to me asking questions and I did not reply. As to most of you that emailed me i have sent you a message tell why which was i could not remember the password to that email account. I have so many emails its hard to remember everything. So please feel free to email me now and I will check daily for any questions relating to this torrent! Peace and thank you!
,brutalT,2010-01-20T03:58Z,"how the hell do you extract an iso? when i try to do so, it says it isn't an archive"
,PainDriven8555,2010-01-22T03:51Z,"ok brutalT, If you would have read my big comment above yours you would understand how to extract the iso but i will explain it to you in short. Download a program called *7zip* then right click the ISO you get from the download (CD1 and CD2 ISOs) then you will see 7zip in a box that comes up after the right click. Put your mouse cursor on 7zip then another box will appear and choose extract files. A folder should appear right beside of the ISOs you got from the download. Then follow the steps in the comment above that i left to help others install the game. Next time read other comments before downloading a torrent because most of us don't like having to repeat ourselves in the comments"
,PainDriven8555,2010-01-22T04:25Z,Also to everyone who is installing this game by means of my long comment. I am running windows vista so the install may be different for people running different windows. Sorry for the inconvenience!!! I will try and have a install guide for the other windows types soon. Thankyou for your time!
,Desolator4u,2010-02-02T00:53Z," Couldn't find my copy of this game so i'm downloading it again. Never did finish it, only the Marines campaign. Hope it runs on Win 7. 
I suspect this torrent is gonna get some more activity since the newest AvP game is coming out soon."
,Desolator4u,2010-02-02T01:04Z," Every software torrent has the same bunch of bs comments, asking how to install it, or what to do when it asks you for CD. Come on ppl..."
,emiliux,2010-02-03T19:21Z,"Hey, Can Someone help me. Its like this: Everytime I play either a cooparate, predalien or predator campaign after the first mission (in every campaign) the game just crashes and sends me back to main menu. I looked for a pach to fix this in Google, but I couldn't find one. So can Someone please tell me what to do? "
,DarkLoveofGods,2010-02-05T02:45Z,I cant extract the files with jzip or 7zip i dont know what to do ive been trying this all day and it wont work i could use some help

,Fozzibab,2010-02-07T13:30Z,"I don't have any problem getting the game to run, but I am having a problem actually playing the thing. 

I can't start up any single player campaign. I choose the race and the difficulty, hit start, and then the loading screen shows up for about 2 seconds and it drops back to the main menu.

Is anyone else having this issue? "
,Lysenn,2010-02-13T17:55Z,"To those having problems loading single player:

Turn off the auto-protection on your anti-virus software before you play the game. After that, it should load just fine (just don't forget to turn in back on when you're done playing!). "
,DexterDK,2010-02-21T18:08Z,"Got an audio problem. Characters voices skip in cut scenes and gamplay. I can only hear ambient sound fx in the background.

Game installs and runs flawlessly tho. good job :)"
,xXSkullpturaXx,2010-03-15T20:52Z,"Thanks a ton dude, works 100%, just follow these steps:

1) Mount the AVP_Disk 1 iso.
2) Begin Installation
3) When it asks for Disk 2, Mount AVP_Disk 2 iso
4) After installation, run the patch.
5) After patching, copy the AVP2.exe into the installation folder, overwriting the original.
6) Play! "

,vincusg,2011-10-11T05:54Z,"I was looking for skidrow updates for AVP 2010 on demonoid and couldnt find it. So i came to pirate bay unfortunately. And as expected, cant seem to find it on here... but then there is this torrent....                  Unbelievable, it seems that many, many many many people are having problems with this torrent. That leaves two possibilities.

1)The torrent is shit
2)People on piratebay are shit

Ill download it and let u know what the deal is."

,LittleVinnie,2012-03-03T20:06Z,"If you are having trouble installing, heres what i did and it works. 
Open up both of the disc isos. I use poweriso. Then drag the contents of disc 2 into disc one. You can close the 2nd disc window Then once you do that, double click the setup.exe in the disc one menu. It should ask you if you want to extract to a temporary folder or run directly. Click temporary folder. Then it will install, it should get to somewhere around 60% and ask for disk 2. Select the temporary folder that you used as your temporary. Click ok. Then it may ask for disc 1 again, select the temp folder again. It will finish installing. go to the installation folder, and copy the cracked avp2.exe to the installation folder. 
It works."
,Kixx123,2012-03-25T13:27Z,Please Seed!! Thanks
,asdfkjjj,2012-04-02T23:34Z,Copy ISO contents to temp folder and run setup from there. Download the 1096 update and the 1096 NoCD patch from the net. Patch and copy over crack.  I also recommend getting the widescreen mod. Google is your friend. Game works great. +1

,brandondano,2012-05-27T03:33Z,"vincusg, you do realize this isnt AVP 2010 right?"
,JpMasterLord,2012-06-05T13:36Z,Hey guys thanks for this torrent and all i want is the primal hunt since i already have the avp2 cd and game installed already.so can i ask some tips on how to do this thing?sorry for asking because i get tired sometimes reading comments again and again.
,d_h_x,2012-06-13T22:28Z,"you need a program to convert the .bin file into a .iso file (google: bin2iso) and convert the primalhunt.bin then just mount with Deamon Tools or Alcohol and install...

P.S. vincusg: you are an idiot. first this isnt AVP 2010 and second what makes you think that demonoid is better than tpb?"
,fslaker,2012-08-07T23:13Z,It worked completely FINE on my win7 64bits..BUT the mouse horizontal axis seems more sensitive than y axis.
,AlfinAndy,2012-08-08T08:55Z,"work perfectly, thanks man."
,Cjones64,2012-08-25T18:52Z,"I click Play, I select a detail (high medium low) and a window pops up. suddenly the program stops working. Any tips on how to get it to respond?"
