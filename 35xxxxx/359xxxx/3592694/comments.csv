,Koslowski,2007-01-12T17:28Z,Many thanks!! I've been looking for that for AGES!!!
,euclideanspace,2007-01-13T16:18Z,More seeds needed please! The torrent is virtually dead at the moment.
,badassnoodle,2007-03-26T09:25Z,"I'm going to stop seeding this for now, this problemchild wont support itself (coz of the leechers) please seed it while its still alive.."
,Crnnica,2009-01-10T11:49Z,Thank youuuuuu!
,dadicsmradic,2009-06-16T20:18Z,"Considering this movie
1 - is a true masterpiece
2 - comes from FreakyFlicks family I truly respect
3 - was uploaded more than 2 years ago, 

I think it would be OK if you seed as much as you can and keep it alive. I downloaded it last month and I (and just few others) keep on seeding despite some thoughtless jerks..

so. SEED! thank you
