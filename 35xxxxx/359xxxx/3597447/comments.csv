,joeybhoy,2007-01-17T18:51Z,"This is full of trojans and virisus,  he he he he he, no I am only joking havent even downloaded yet. There is a lot of that happening around TPB lately, bloody wankers. Thanks very much to the uploader for this. I tried the student version and was not impressed, kept getting error messages saying there was no disc in drive?? really annoying and it looked for updates since 2002. Thanks very much for this, much appreciated. Cheers"
,Chikaca,2007-01-19T11:09Z,"So.. Anyone install this thing yet? Comments please? Seems a little small for having all updates integrated in it, but I dono.."
,AnGrY_BaStArD,2007-01-20T14:50Z,"WARNING!

there is a version of keygens that will disable the task manager - heres how to fix it

1. run>cmd>tasklist
2. taskkill /pid  xxx /f - where xxx is the pid's of the bad services
3.REG add HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System /v DisableTaskMgr /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f

and its all gone, seems virus checkers let this one past for now
PLEASE PASS THIS ON.

*** THIS RELEASE IS NOT AFFECTED ***"
,messedup22,2007-01-21T22:24Z,"I installed this on my mac using Microsoft's Virtual PC and it worked great!

The disk image is in .nrg format so you either need to have Nero Burning ROM or convert the file to .iso format using a program like nrg2iso (http://www.download-by.net/audio-and-multimedia/rippers-and-converters/110903,nrg2iso.html).  Can't complain though seeing as how the file is so small.  Serial is included and it never asks you to  activate.

Three cheers for Lizav!"
,KennyMan666,2007-01-22T16:19Z,"This is not Win XP Pro x64 Edition, right?"
,messedup22,2007-01-23T06:45Z,That's right.  It's XP Pro 32.
,Drunken Munkey,2007-01-23T17:20Z,"This sounds excellent. I'm currently downloading Win XP Pro SP2 from another person with updates up to January 2007, but I seen comments on it saying it can't be updated and/or errors may pop up.

Does this version have Windows updating working fully? So, can I continue to update as more fixes etc are released from Microsoft?

Thanks a lot for the upload, I may cancel my other and download this instead. Sounds more reliable :)"
,Drunken Munkey,2007-01-23T17:25Z,"Oh, and thanks AnGrY_BaStArD, if that information is true. It appears you've posted that warning on most of the Windows XP Pro torrents :)

I shouldn't worry too much about this one as I don't think a keygen is even needed- I think a key is provided."
,cis2229,2007-01-29T23:27Z,"After I had entered the serial number, the system rebooted then it sked me to place the Xp SP2 disc in. But I already had it in. What could I be doing wrong? Thanks."
,frogman9,2007-01-31T13:24Z,the file at fileho.com was deleted :-(
,Izo9660,2007-04-20T22:51Z,"Great torrent. Works wonderful. Big, big thanks. "
,Honest_Pwn,2007-04-21T18:42Z,Comon plz seed. I'm on my dad's computer and i have nothing nothing left on my computer just boot sector. I need this download bad.
,DoctorMe,2008-08-12T23:06Z,nobody's said whether or not the updates are working on this one...
