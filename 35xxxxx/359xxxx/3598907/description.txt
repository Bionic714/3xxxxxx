One minute she?a a lady, the next a tramp! Because her rich husband has no time for her, Barbara, a seemingly-happy housewife, assumes the identity of "Brandy," a high-priced hooker, and tries to erase THE AGONY OF LOVE by plunging into a whirlpool of sex and money: "Now that you?re bought me, what do you want me to do?" A genuaine sex schizo, Barbara craves "normal love" but instead mes it witha shy fat guy, a creep who slaps her around, and even a wacko with a truly twisted foot fetish. But Barbara?s bawdy bubble bursts when she attneds an orgy and discovers a surprise guest....

PLUS: Love-starved Kitty is THE GIRL WITH THE HUNGRY EYES - which drives her lesbian lover Tigercat crazy. So crazy that when Kitty suggests "it?s time for a change" and makes it with a man, Tigercat bashes the poor guy?s head in. But after Tigercat gets violent at Kitty?s girl-on-girl birthday bash, Kitty ends her "vacation from men" by heading straight for the arms of an old boyfriend, forcing "this Tigercat broad" to sharpen her claws and go in for the kill....

I accidently deleted one of the Pat Barrington Shorts.  :-( Compatible with Philips 642 and other Standalone DivX players.  Gallery images in lossless PNG format.  Reviews and screens at the links above.  The Extras are definitely GREAT quality too.
