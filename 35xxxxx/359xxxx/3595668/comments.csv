,Kornsthebest5544,2007-07-10T19:31Z,"I have burned the Installer ISO to a disc, using ISO Recorder by Alex Feinman, and when I put it into my CD the installer pops up just like it should, but when I click to install, it gives me this error: 

Error executing file
D:\setup.exe
The requested operation requires elevation

Any idea as to why it would be doing this? I know it's something I did because it works for everyone else.

By the way:
Windows Vista 32bit"

Just mount the language iso with Daemon.  Take off install iso first.  I have to remount it every time i want to open it again.

My question is.  How do your burn it.  Do you just put the iso on a cd, or when using nero smartstart click 'Make UDF/ISO cd'?  or bootable, or just make data cd and add it on?  
Can you add a language iso with the install? or does it have to be seperate cd?"

,skeetmann,2008-07-07T14:55Z,"This is junk! It has a mandatory email registration (stated to offset the high cost of seeding) before you can install!

Junk!  Stay away from this one!  Don't waste your time!  "

,crunchpig,2008-07-25T13:38Z,"Skeetmann is full of sheet, man. Everything works great and is as simple as can be. For the guy with the elevate message, you need to browse to  setup.exe, right click, and Run as Administrator."
,morrison0880,2008-10-30T21:51Z,"Hey all. Go to 
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3865583/Rosetta_Stone_Ultimate_Language_Disk_v2.iso
You get every language in an iso file. No Extracting, all you have to do is burn it to a disc with PowerISO or Alcohol and it autostarts when you load it. You can also mount it to your virtual drive. It comes with all the help files, language sheets, and even a bonus language program. Works perfectly. I got this about a year ago and I love it.
Oh, and only 3.62 GB, so it fits perfectly on a DVD, or takes up as little space on your HD as possible. Trust me, this is the easiest way to go. I tried torrents like this, and the set up and installation alone was the biggest pain in the a...With this, no installation is needed.

The file is in ISO format. You don't have to install the program to your computer. You can use PowerISO to burn it to a disc, and it will autorun on your computer anytime after you put the disc in. Or, if you don't want to burn it, simply use the ""Mount"" option in PowerISO and choose to mount image to drive [E]. It should then open up the file folder with RS in it. If it doesn't, go to ""My Computer"", right click on your new (E) drive, and click run. That's all you have to do. Rosetta Stone will run on its own, no installation needed, no extracting files, it is all self-contained. You will see every language, all you have to do is choose one and off you go."
,soy_boricua,2009-03-29T06:49Z,"what the hell I'm doing wrong? 
newbie here I burnt both app and Chinesse and I installed app that works but it will not find any languages!"
,SumeklamKidd,2009-04-09T10:33Z,"Thanks Moos3

This is the only RS app I can get to work on Vista. Can't understand the crybabies that always want the latest version of everything for free, they really need to get a life. This is the same version that RS used to charge big money for. Works for me. Good uploads.

Newbies: you must mount this app on MagicISO (free on the NET), AND install it. Also, mount any language ISOs you want to study on a new drive on Magic ISO, you must have both. Navigate ""browse CD"" from MagicISO, click on the application within the installer ISO, which opens the RS. Now you can click on the language you want to learn. EZ. "

No, it's 2.0.8.1D or whatever. So even though it works, it's basically useless for anything except like French.

Really??? I use it for Russian and Chinese just fine, thank you."
