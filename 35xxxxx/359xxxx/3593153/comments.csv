,xaviel,2007-01-10T03:01Z,THIS IS THE SHIT!!! Episode is real!
,Mister Monroe,2007-01-10T11:07Z,What´s the point with this one? This episode is on all of the DVD-releases allready out there.
,screenslave,2007-01-10T15:37Z,"Still counting down to the start of the 6th season in the States, shouldn't pick up the thread in about 4-5 weeks. 

Why bitch about this torrent? Even assholes like you xaviel and Mister Monroe should be able to look at the size of the file and realize that it's the 1st act of the 5th episode. What's the fucking problem? Moan somewhere else. Yep, it's on the dvd with the previous four episodes, but even that dvd have been divided into four separate torrents by some users. For those who do not speak moron, this is the 1st 10-12 minutes of the 5th episode, as a sort of teaser - it ends when we know Jack is back on track. People getting pissed about this should contact Fox Television instead of bitching to the user who put out the torrent. Grow a brain for fuck sake!"
