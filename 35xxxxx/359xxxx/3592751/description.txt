> Ashampoo Burning Studio 6.40se (ABS-640) includes keygen & patch <


This latest version of Ashampoo Burning Studio is even better than the
previous ones.  This CD/DVD/Blu-ray burning application makes it extremely
easy to create & copy your own data, video, audio, and multisession CDs,
as well as DVDs and Blu-ray discs.  Many current CD/DVD burning programs
are universal (they include just about everything except the kitchen sink)
applications that are overloaded with countless confusing functions.
Ashampoo Burning Studio 6.40 makes life easier by concentrating on what
you really want to do.


What?s new:
- Multi-disc file backup and restore on CDs, DVDs and Blu-Ray discs.
- Create compressed backup archives with powerful password protection.
- Split archives automatically across multiple CDs, DVDs or Blu-Ray discs.
- Restore archive contents to their original locations.
- Integrated Audio CD ripper ? store your audio tracks as WMA or WAV files.
- New option for setting the number of copies you want to burn (available
  for all disc formats).
- Discs can now be verified immediately without being ejected first (IF the
  drive supports this feature)
- Numerous other small improvements that make the program easier to use and
  more effective

                   Installation/Registration Instructions

This is the latest, greatest version of Ashampoo Burning Studio.  You can
install and use it for a limited 10 day trial period, ... install and use it
for an extended trial period (40 days I think), .... or install and use it as
a fully registered application.

To install:
Extract the files, then double-click " ashampoo_burningstudio640_se.exe" to start
the installation process.  Once the installation process is finished you can choose
to do one of three things.  When ABS-640 is started up for the first
time, you can use it in the following ways:

1) 10 day trial:
   Just run it as is, and you'll have a 10 day trial period.

2) Extended Trial:
   Register with Ashampoo and receive a key number you can enter to extend your
   trial period to 40 days.
   a) To receive the extended trial key, CLICK "Help>Register...". You're
      browser will open the Ashampoo website to register ABS-640.  With
      registration, you're sent the extended trial key number by email
 NOTE: (This is the number you'll be sent. "BS07A0-770098-0000A0").
   b) Enter the key given you by following the directions that come with the
      registration email, and you'll have your trial extention.

3) It's Yours:
   To make ABS-640 fully functional (remove the Trial time bomb), use the
   included Keygen ("kg-ABS-6.40.exe" Thanks to "Black Riders") to generate your
   own unique activation number, then enter the number where required.
   
 NOTE: If for some reason you used the extended extended trial number, the easiest
       way to enter your own generated number is to just use the application until
       the trial period ends.  When the trial period ends, you'll start getting
       the usual "trial is over" nag when you start it up.  You'll also have an 
       option to enter your activation number.  Enter the generated number and
       your good to go.
 
 NOTE: A Patch for the ABS-640 is also included, but I've had no need to use
       it yet.  I'm not sure if it's really needed, but IF for some reason, the
       key-generated number stops working, the patch is there to give it a try. 
    

                          ENJOY!!!
