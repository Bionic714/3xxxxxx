,Book early,2007-01-07T10:06Z,a lot of great music.but tell me please...how can i convert it to cd...i mean the common one.
,Gazurdon,2007-01-07T11:32Z,use Ashampoo MP3 AudioCenter 
,stigvige,2007-01-07T11:48Z,"DonÂ´t use ashampo because it will be mp3 format, then it useless because it will lose quality. Use instead Easy CD-DA Extractor to burn it as a common cd (lossless). You will need to download Flac-plugin (It's freeware)"
,stigvige,2007-01-07T17:51Z,that's ok :)
,stigvige,2007-01-07T17:55Z,"by the way, it's not the original Glenn Miller recordings, it's remastred and applyed electric..."
,kokken,2007-10-07T16:11Z,But it's damn good quality!
[T],keeybee,2009-07-07T15:43Z,"Try to find Ted Heath Ted orchestra - A salute to Glenn Miller, that's good quality. Sorry, but I only have it on vinyl. It seems to be hard to find on CD. Bur you can find some of the recordings here http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4114053/Ted_Heath_-_The_Golden_Age_Of_Ted_Heath_Vol.1 and http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4114056/Ted_Heath_-_The_Golden_Age_Of_-_Vol.2. Both torrents active when I write this."
[T],keeybee,2009-07-08T17:17Z,"For vol 2 try this torrent
