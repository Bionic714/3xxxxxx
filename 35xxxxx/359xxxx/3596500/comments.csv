,FaderAbraham,2007-01-16T18:19Z,"I noticed some of the KTMA movies played later in the series(e.g. the movies with Gamera.) Do they include the same soundtrack, like, are they just sort of ""re-runs"", or do they include entirely new commentaries?

I'm guessing some of you guys know some about this and I'd be very happy if you could give me an answer.

Excuse me, I'm a noob in this area."

,PlasticFish,2007-11-21T09:30Z,"Thankyouthankyouthankyouthankyouthankyou...

I used to have most of the shows (most of them taped from Comedy Central), but those got left behind when I moved overseas a few years ago... This is superb, especially because I'd never seen some of the first season or any of the KTMA shows... I am making a point to share all of these torrents at a minimum of 2:1 and hope others will do likewise.

You rock, UMe2!"
