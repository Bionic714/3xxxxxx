,david1,2007-01-19T15:48Z,"I don't care what others think, but this is NOT metal: Rage Against Machine, Alice In Chains, Marilyn Manson, Guns N Roses, Faith No More, Def Leppard, Korn, ACDC, Kiss and did I forgot anyone? Especially not GnR!  It's one of the greatest rock bands ever, but it's not metal! And it's not ""hard rock"" either!   /Genre fascism forever"
,bloodstainer,2007-01-19T23:19Z,"sry david1 but slayer is ranked as Black metal/trash Iron maiden as heavy metal and Accept 2 and a lots of other bands 2 here I'm not saying that all of it is metal but this is the ""40 Greatest Metal Songs"" list so just stop complaining"
,bloodstainer,2007-01-19T23:20Z,and btw plz seed I will do after I get it
,Woodwyrm,2007-01-20T03:22Z,"Faith No More is progressive, surely you wouldn't claim that Opeth isn't metal?!"

,BlackCat944T,2007-02-27T21:25Z,Thanks CSMongo.... Nice collection :)
,mjaeltbrand,2007-03-11T00:03Z,"A pretty damn inconsisted list imo. First of all, they could have called it ""40 Greatest HARDROCK Songs"" and not metal, for 90% of that aint metal. My second opinion is that 99% the songs they have listed can be beaten by something better, I mean;
WHAT THE FUCK IS ENTER SANDMAN AND RUN TO THE HILLS DOING ON THAT LIST! Metallica got better songs than THAT, for example anything from the 4 first albums. And to NOT have Hallowed be thy name on such a list is a crime! 
It is clear that the list is based on ""The 40 most popular, overrated and live performed/MTV shown songs in hardrock history, INCLUDING the earliest hardrock bands on the top"". Duh, were's stairway to heaven and Immigrant song?
I am not saying that the songs are bad, they are not, but the list is crap.

My opinion is my own, i am not trying to stop you downloading this collection. Please don't flame me because my intension was to critisize this list, and no the fans of it.

May the seeds be with you, and gl hf"
,slankov,2007-03-29T22:11Z,"this list is just crap, must be a bunch of retards who put it together"
,tommypusn,2007-04-17T11:49Z,yeah dude :D iron maiden fucking rock
,malligaJag,2007-04-25T13:08Z,tack
,Birramannen,2007-06-27T19:45Z," andrisuper - 2007-06-21 00:08 CET:
I think this is just some favorite list choosen by producer on VH1 or something , non of the songs deserved to be there

Wtf do you even listen to Metal??? wtf you most be retarded a bunch of these song built the ground for ALL modern Metal and you dont think they fit at all *suck* this song list is actually kinda good i might have done it bit different but everybody got different taste it is almost impossible to but up a list of the 40 greatest songs that everybody agrees is the correct one so stop complaining.......and seed"
,Sabretou,2007-07-01T16:52Z,"Guns N' Roses?! Slayer?! Megadeth?! METALLICA?!!

What motherfucker wrote this list?"
,badalhoca,2007-07-11T16:59Z,40 greates metal songs for RETARDS
,dudedudesson,2007-08-09T12:38Z,Only thing good here is Slipknot and Slayer.
,andersrg,2007-08-12T03:04Z,"Well, Mjaelbrandt, the term ""heavy metal"" ain't actually a genre. It contains everything from prog rock, hard rock and emo to black metal... All listed tracks and bands are mentioned in my ""Rough guide to heavy metal"", so that should make it pretty clear I'm right. Maybe the tracks ain't the 40 best, but it sure picks out essentials that defined the genre. ( M'kay... Led's are missing)  

Btw, i saw Metallica's Concert the 10th of July in Oslo, and Enter sandman wore the definate highlight, if you ask me and the 40.000 other fans there."
,8mbit,2007-08-22T20:54Z,A simpel solution to you that dont like this list dont download
,TheNightbringer,2007-09-03T16:41Z,Metallica SUCK...i mean why are they even on this list...they can´t even play their instruments good...and their songs sounds exacly the same...now Slayer and megadeth. Thats Music!!! but they have only one song each on the list...this suck!!
,TheNightbringer,2007-09-03T16:43Z,And they could add some better maiden songs
,Tsuribachi,2007-09-21T06:16Z,yea fuck this list. most of it it hardrock.
,chookymeister,2007-10-14T09:12Z,"i do agree most of this is hard rock (not saying i don't love hard rock) though read the TITLE. VH1 aren't gonna do the 40 best heavy metal songs, they are gonna do the 40 best songs to get them more views. You think most of the people would have heard of Hallowed Be Thy Name, NO. It's an awesome song but it isn't necessarily good for the show. Just answering some of these people, if u want to make a list then go and make it and put a link in one of these comments."
,soul_forge,2007-10-21T10:53Z,"Ok first of all, the term metal music has changed dramatically since the first inception of it.  Deep Purple was the first band ever to be termed as metal, so as a list for metal I think this is pretty acurate in the sense that it is meaning the genre that these songs started out as, although GnR is not metal and never has been. Second if you think Metallica sounds the same and Slayer doesnt then you have a mental condition and you might want to get that checked out. I like Slayer though dont get me wrong.  And isn't Marilyn Manson considered shock rock?  But this is the perfect song of his to put on the list though."
,Cheezedude,2007-10-26T16:20Z,"dude, var är Angel of death av Slayer?  bara massa gammal mainstream skit här föresten..."
,PoisonFist,2007-11-07T23:46Z,THis is all metal(you idiots!!!!) with the exception of korn and rage against the musical talent. Black Sabbath is THE first metal band(look it up) therefore bands with similar sound and song structure are also metal. AC/DC is really the only hard rock band on the list and no matter how much metallica now sux they deserve to be on most best of lists although the songs on this list a pretty mediocre. Why is there no DEATH on this list is what i want to know.......then again this VHfucking 1
,FrIeK,2007-11-18T01:17Z,"I really don't care what other are saying. This is a list of a great music. Something more than else. 

Its definitely a thumbs up from me for the torrent. 

Its simple. If you do not like the music. Don't download.

If you want to discuss the list. Find a forum for that. This torrent is here to download. So who that like music, download it. And them that not like. Find something there like, and download.

That's my opinion.

So thanks for a great torrent:-D"
,tmishkoor,2007-12-17T18:05Z,"listen up everybody, if you have a complaint about the list, go to vh1.com, you comment here about how fast the torrent downloaded, if the files were correct, not about vh1. thank you."
,amberleaf99,2008-01-21T00:46Z,"GREAT LIST GREAT U/L THANKS MAN...FUCK WHAT THE OTHERS SAY I THINK THEY MUST BE RETARDS...MAYBE THEY DIDN,T GET ENOUGH BREAST MILK WHEN THEY WERE SUCKING ON MUMMY,S TIT EH?  POWER 2 THE PEOPLE P2P ROCKS AND TPB :~>"
,Simba1908,2008-02-16T12:18Z,"Thx for this upload! When you like this music, then download. Maybe it's not Metal but it's still a beutiful collection of good music!! Thx."

,d3b0v0,2008-06-10T20:38Z,"ooh.. great... only.. half of it isn't metal...
like.. welcome to the jungle? Ace of spades? Hahaha, AC/DC? Metal? Are you fuckin' kidding me?!?!? xD"
,kgk1991,2008-06-14T01:09Z,d3b0v0... are you fucking stupid? acdc is the original metal and you need to get your history str8 welcome to the jungle gave birth to metal... when white snake was doing its pussy glam shit guns came str8 from teh la streets and told it like it was... 
,Xeokym,2008-07-13T10:56Z,"LOL...so many people arguing over what is ""metal"" and what is not! I knew this one was going to have several PAGES of comments. It's fucking pointless to argue over what bands are metal and what ones aren't. Opinions are like assholes; everybody's got one. But anyone complaining about who is on the list, you obviously have not see the show, as it comes in four 1-hour parts, and each hour covers a different time period starting from 1970, going up to early 90s, and each genre is covered, from thrash to glammy poofy-hair faggy to thrash and speed metal."
,Pirates_Prevail,2008-09-01T17:34Z,"thanks for the D/L, oh and all you pussies fighting over whats metal...its ""VH1""s list of metal...im just saying prob not your best source for hardcore metal.  But i do agree, G&R came straight out of hell and put everybody in their place!"
,MD42,2008-11-17T16:38Z,"I cant believe some one is trying to say G&R ""Welcome to the Jungle"" Gave birth to Metal! LMFAO thats like one of the most dumb things I have ever read.

Don't get me wrong I like G&R saw em Live back in 88 but get ""your"" Metal history right if your going to call someone els stupid ;)"
,POLIFARB,2008-11-18T15:40Z,Thx!Why not here GNR - Nocking Heavens Door?
,lol_davve,2008-11-24T16:14Z,"Most are hard rock and not metal. But all the fucking people in the world who are listning to metal love this too. And if they not, they are not true fans of the music. :P"
