,thatsmine,2007-01-09T23:05Z,oh and please make it fit on 1 dvd so the download will be less big  ;-)
,Guilba,2007-01-10T00:29Z,"It fits on 1 dvd, a DL DVD ;)
Thanks for the UL and please put the second one."
,Odisseus,2007-01-10T01:43Z,"great movie, I personally think it is the best of the 3
thanks for the upload

kef71 may I ask you to make something clear to me - does disc1 contain the whole movie, and disc2 the extras? or is the movie on both discs"
,manborn,2007-01-10T03:05Z,"been trying to get this thru

660F0A1E4A542FC49B2F360DBD3530D054E98362

but finally this copy is out"
[T],kef71,2007-01-10T07:56Z,Odisseus: Disc 1 is movie only. The extras are on Disc 2.
[T],kef71,2007-01-10T10:35Z,I think the extreme edition has a HD WM9 version of the movie on the second disc.
,RD_Plissken,2007-01-11T23:44Z,"Is this version the one vith old sarah connor at the end, aka laser disc version?"
