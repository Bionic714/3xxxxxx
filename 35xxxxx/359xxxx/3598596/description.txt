SINOPSIS: Destination Moon was the first major science-fiction film produced in the United States, and won the Academy Award for Best Special Effects (Lee Zavitz). The noted science-fiction writer Robert A. Heinlein contributed significantly to the script and invented many of the special effects. He also published, about the same time as the release of the film, Destination Moon, a short story of the same name that was based on the screenplay. Rather than a drama, the film more closely resembles a documentary or a propaganda piece, and it was promoted through an unprecedented onslaught of publicity in the print media. Seven years before Sputnik, the movie clearly spells out a rationale for the space race: the bad guys (clearly the communists) are sabotaging the American space project, and if we don't beat them to the moon, they'll make a base there to drop bombs on us, and take over the world.
