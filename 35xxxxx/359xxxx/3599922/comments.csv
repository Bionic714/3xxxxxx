,anders_and,2007-01-21T12:01Z,"probably you did everything right, since the seeding started. Later on, you did something wrong: stopped seeding before anybody had finished a download. So, just go on seeding a couple of days, and everything is just fine."
,AlbertE592,2007-01-21T15:58Z,Thanks for the info. anders_and - I had a bit of a ''power-cut'' problem in my local vicinity - things o.k. now - and I have resumed seeding !!
,hbturley,2007-01-22T12:56Z,"Thank you very much, just perfect.

,mac_davis,2007-01-26T14:03Z,Amazing seeders! Azureus tells me I'm receiving 560-590 kB/s. Terrific!!
,mac_davis,2007-01-26T15:04Z,"I've downloaded it, entered the serial, and disallowed it from internet access. When I run the application, what is supposed to be a welcome screen (I presume) is just empty and all of Acrobat's actions (including quite) are disabled. Have I done something wrong?"
,AlbertE592,2007-01-26T20:07Z,"Not sure what has happened with you 'mac_davis' - I am running it on a Powerbook G4 (not the intel one) under OS 10.4.8 - and everything is fine. In fact it runs much, much faster than I ever could get Acrobat 7 Pro to run."
,jessmjc,2007-03-10T09:12Z,"I downloaded this .dmg file but must have deleted the Keygen by mistake.  Any chance someone could post the Key Gen on this site ?

Really appreciated as it would save me downloading it all again."
,tiiyu,2007-04-08T13:45Z,"Can't get Acrobat 8 to work. I keep getting an error message saying I have to launch other suite before I can even register the application. I've started Photoshop and Illustrator - but still the same error message.... Can anybody help me?

Thanks"
,econcepts,2007-04-10T08:24Z,"I have the same problem. Acrobat launches, everything works fine for about 30 seconds and then I get an error box saying: Adobe Acrobat 8 cannot launch at this time. You need at least one other suite application  (such as photoshop) to be open before you can launch"". I tried opening several other apps, but still did not work. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!"
,AlbertE592,2007-04-16T21:00Z,"Not sure why a couple of users are having some problems - may be a compatibility issue with some other 'third party' software.

However, have a quick look at (http://www.adobeforums.com/cgi-bin/webx/.3bc31dc7) - this may (or may not) be of help!"
,danga294,2007-04-28T04:24Z,"hey ""mac_davis"" or anyone else... how do you get download speeds to be that insane? I cant seem to exceed 70 (which happened once)... im usually at like 2-30 kb/s ... i've had my dl and up load both set on unlimited and i have my own internet ( i dont take it from someone else). I use a router (lynksis) .. am i doing anything wrong? can I fix or optimize anything??"
,AlbertE592,2007-04-29T00:53Z,"danga294

It sounds as if you have a NAT configuration issue with your router (port forwarding) - setting this correctly will significantly increase your download speeds. To find more about this, try using Google to search for something like ''how do I increase my BitTorrent download speed'' - Also, have a look at your Lynksis documentation to see if this has a section on the port-forwarding setting. - Hope this info. helps"
,AlbertE592,2007-04-29T00:58Z,"danga294

Another point is that I would not have your upload speed set to unlimited (this will hog your bandwith and slow your downloads) - you will need to find a happy medium which will depend on your broadband speed (eg 2MB, 4MB, etc) - for example, I believe that on a 2MB pipe, a good setting is 'unlimited download but limiting the upload to approx 25 KB/s' - unless, of course if you are seeding - then give the upload all you can"
,xhair,2007-05-03T19:17Z,"For you with problems like ""Adobe Acrobat 8 cannot launch at this time. You need at least one other suite application"" See this: http://www.adobe.com/cfusion/knowledgebase/index.cfm?id=kb400590"
,derekdimarco,2007-06-04T10:44Z,Downloaded ok. Works first time. No problems at all.
,pdegen,2007-09-17T03:41Z,"Thanks, works perfect."
,varg-larsen,2007-10-23T16:39Z,"re: xhair
off course! but what if i have patched the adobe apps to remove the registration (and make it work on hackintosh)? 
so the question remains, how to make acrobat think the suit is regd without actually registrate? "
,Giggsy55,2007-11-17T00:53Z,"Hi Danga

Yep getting 70 just like you that guy must have !!Special powers!! _ bloody impossible, my max dl speed has been 109 kbs and could not believe it"
,bubastisbastet,2007-12-08T10:26Z,"nice one dude! -works a treat. THANKS.

installed fine on OSX "
,Minerva.TheGift,2007-12-10T06:32Z,"I have installed this on a G4 (non-Intel) Mac running Max OS X 10.4 (Tiger) and it works great!
The install for this is fairly self-explanatory thanks to a well designed .dmg file.
First, double click the .dmg file.  Then, do as the picture suggests...drag the picture of an Adobe folder there in the middle of that window to your Applications folder.
Once that finishes copying (it's around 902mb) open the Adobe Acrobat Profession 8 file in that folder that just finished copying (""Adobe Acrobat 8 Professional"")
From the install menu, there's a note about a serial key in an .rtf file.  I used that and it worked fine.
If that doesn't work for you, just check out Serial Box for a key.
Remember, don't register.  It wouldn't be a bad idea to get Little Snitch (demo mode is free) and use that, just in case.

,ugnis,2008-01-17T20:09Z,"Thanks for whoever is seeding this! My download never went slower than ~ 120 KB/s, done in under an hour. Thanks a lot :)"
,courtney5780,2008-01-31T02:36Z,Getting 0 Kb/s download rate.  Someone please seed?

ÂľTorrent version 1.77?"
,golfpro,2008-02-22T11:12Z,Doesn't work for me....gives me the message that I need to have another adobe application running. Apparently a common thing.
,dalineko,2008-03-07T23:49Z,"Working on my 10.5.2 Intel HackMac.

This torrent is really well seeded. I can recommend it (dl'ed it in 30mins with 250kb/s constantly). To get rid of the ""run another app""-error, just apply the patch from the design suite premium floating around here (somewhere on TPB). Replacing the executable (with a ""cracked"" package also floating around on tpb) is not recommended, cause the error remains. "
,ugnis,2008-04-02T23:36Z,"Thanks, exactly what I was looking for.

Mac OS X 10.5.2 intel"
,dannyisgood,2008-04-16T06:15Z,"Sweetness of all that is sweet!  It works...  
I just dragged the folder, opened the serial, opened the program under Applications, plugged in the serial, and of course ""never remind me"" on the registration.  I'm running Intel based Mac with 10.4."
