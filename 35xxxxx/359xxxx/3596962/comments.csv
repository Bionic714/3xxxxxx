,SoundWall,2007-01-16T11:16Z,""" - Norton Ghost 11 Boot ""

FAKE!!
There is no Norton Ghost 11. Version 10.0 is the latest release. Check it out for yourself at Symantec's website."
,Sabresite,2007-01-16T17:42Z,"Why don't you use the CD before you speak, okay?  After you do that, come back and reply."
,Sabresite,2007-01-16T17:43Z,"As a note:  This CD does not contain any patches, cracks, or altered files. 
You need a valid and legal serial number to use these installations, or if you are using Windows XP illegally, crack it yourself."
,Sabresite,2007-01-17T09:02Z,"What are you babbling about? there is no kill.exe, so there is no trojan (or are you talking about the WGA crack it DOESN'T have).

And as for seeds, there are 250 right now..."
,katziewolf41,2007-01-17T18:23Z,"if there were that many seeders i would be done by now, but nooooooo im stuck at %79"
,Sabresite,2007-01-17T22:59Z,"Most of the seeders are from demonoid, you need an account there to leech from them.

There are also 1000 people requesting it, so the speed may get slow."
,katziewolf41,2007-01-18T02:42Z,where is the activation key? whats the point of installing this when there is no activation key?
,redlight_traitor,2007-01-18T06:39Z,great way to crack windows XP pro without installing anything - http://www.rfuz.com/windows/tips-and-tricks/crack-or-hack-the-windows-xp-genuine-advantage-validation-check.html
,Sabresite,2007-01-18T09:52Z,"This was not intended for people who do not own the product.  It was made for technicians and computer repairmen.  Instead of carrying 9 windows CDs, you can carry 1."
,Sabresite,2007-01-18T09:59Z,That link simply tells you to change your product key to a volume license key.  That does not work with all versions of windows that are provided by this CD.
,urbanity,2007-01-19T08:03Z,This is absolutely what I was looking for! Thanks for the upload Sabresite!
,keylimelemon,2007-01-20T17:46Z,"Thank you for the file Sab.
But how can we burn a 701MB file to a CD (700MB is the biggest size)?"
,DjJk,2007-01-21T00:08Z,All the CDs i've used are 703mb
,psylynx,2007-01-23T08:11Z,"Had problems installing this, error message kept coming up that the system.dat would not copy, upon installing"
,Co_oN,2007-01-26T11:36Z,redlight_traitor thx for the site bro ! works great ! BLESS!
,Sabresite,2007-01-26T22:14Z,"If you are having problems with this installing, have no fear, a new version should be out soon.  There were a few updates to the ISO.

The new torrent will also include a separate windows xp update cd, with all critical, recommended, and additional updates."
,p2pisbad,2007-01-28T07:00Z,"Does anyone have an english Windows
XP Pro OEM Gold/RTM ?
I need a clean CD without any patches, tweaks or servicepacks.
I have a legit xp oem sp1a, but it doese'nt work with nlite.
If anyone has it, please upload!
The CD-label should read WXPOEM_EN

Thank you"
,Maikeroppi,2007-02-03T02:26Z,"Here's a question...  Does this happen to include B창shrat the Sneaky's Driver Packs?  Unfortunately, my XP system uses a SATALink 3114 RAID card, and everytime I reinstall, I have to press F6 and load the driver via a floppy drive.  Those are becoming increasingly harder and harder to find in working order...^_^"
,vidarmoen@hotmail.com,2007-02-09T23:25Z,It is in engelsk 
,yuralovely,2007-02-14T12:55Z,"Windows itselfe is good, no errors. Only 1 huge problem. There is no asian language support. It's been removed. About 230mb. At's good, but i live now in Japan and sometimes need to type in Japanese. But thanks to ""Sabresite"" i can't do it now. I install asian language support from other disk/s and after that all the time appear error. Maybe better instead of that crap just live 1 windows, such as win xp sp 2 corporate, because everyone us it. and put it properly with all software in it, that should be."
,JayBeen,2007-02-14T21:12Z,So go buy a valid copy then. Stop knockin the work that others do. I have a VALID copy of MCE2005OEM but my CD is scratched. I am using this CD to install a legal copy back onto my PC. If you could do as good a job as this then by all means bitch but otherwise STFU
,amir8500,2007-02-22T19:03Z,"Awesome, thanks Sabresite.  Fucking ingrates saying ""thanks to sabresite I don't have the Japanese language pack.""  Fucking idiot, you can thank only yourself that you don't have your original CD.  Why do people download the hard work of someone else then bitch when it wasn't what they wanted?  On a side note, the only problem I had was a missing *.swf file when loading home OEM (this was somewhere around 50 or 51%).  Perhaps it was just a fluke though, I've only used the disc once.  
*Avast! picks up 0 viruses*"
,nuckfuts,2007-02-25T08:00Z,which (if any) versions are v2002 Edition ??
,tommy_ber,2007-02-26T02:13Z,"his is not any orginal windows cd. its too big for that. so whot a fuck is it.  home made whit sp2 or 

do you mean it dont fit to a 700cd. 703 is not a normal cd *!? idiot!"
,tommy_ber,2007-02-26T13:43Z,"nice nice jag mountade med DEAMON4.08 copierade sedan ""skivan"" med CLONCD 5.2.9.1
bootar perfekt bara inte nu jag ska installera det. men de v채rkar fungera bra. nice nice"
,Sabresite,2007-03-01T20:30Z,"If you check the image properties with nero alcohol or some other tool, you will see its 79Mins, which is under the normal 80-83min CD, therefore this does fit on a normal 700MB CD.  You should also know that they round it down.

I am therefore not an idiot like you claim, you are just ignorant of how CDs work."
,Sabresite,2007-03-01T20:33Z,"Regarding other languages, you can get the lanugage files off of any windows CD, and simply add them to the ISO you made with the 9-in-1.  If I added the 100MB of languages, this would not fit on a normal 700MB/80Min CD."
,Sabresite,2007-03-01T20:36Z,"Regarding the SATA drivers, no, this was made from the actual windows cds, with SP2 added.  If you want to add SATA drivers, make an ISO of the flavor you want to use, then add the drivers.  There are articles online on how to add the drivers to a normal windows xp cd."
,halo_dude,2007-03-25T23:25Z,"Hey Sabresite, as an engineer myself I can totally appreciate what you have done here. What kinda material and literature did you read to get this done? 

Dont suppose you looked at the 8 in 1 version of this ""XP OS on 1 CD"" and used that stuff? There was loads of material on it. I considered doing it myself - just dont have the time with work and study (no im not a teenie bopper, im 25 :p).

Cheers"
,davcham9,2007-03-28T15:20Z,Sorry this question may had already been asked or i'm not reading hard enough but is this cd bootable?
,yuralovely,2007-04-13T17:28Z,"This is fully crappy shit i ever seen. Many fucking bastards talking shit about what i wrout before, that no asian support in it.  And you guys bloody wankers should think first. If you buy forexample or get for free some things, you exoect it to work properly. Is in it?  At's why i told you better to make just 1 proper win xp sp2 corporate instead of lot's of shit in it and loosing main files. If you can't do it properly, what the point to do it all? Or make 9 in 1 if you like it, but make fully working, never mind fucking space. On DVD that will do. Now almost all computers support dvd rom i assume. So make it again, and take out shit. And i will say you thank you after that."
,taylorspl,2007-06-13T10:15Z,"@yuralovely
YOU ARE A FUCKING CLOWN SHOE! 

@ Sabresite
Thanks for making a convenient CD for the rest of us. "
,jopie5611,2007-08-02T23:32Z,thanks
,rodbriggs,2007-08-17T23:45Z,"thanks for the up, but i do have some questions. 
nod32 flags the following files b/c it couldn't get inside them to scan them, could someone please explain what they do:
:\setup.cdd - password-protected file (a password would be nice to have so i can scan inside)
:\root\xpho\i386\per_seg5.sw_ - archive damaged
:\root\xphr\i386\per_seg5.sw_ - archive damaged
:\root\xphu\i386\per_seg5.sw_ - archive damaged"
,phobos37,2007-11-10T16:50Z,Burnt it onto CD WITHOUT ANY PROBS BUT I CAN'T GET IT TO BOOT.Do I need to format my existing xp pro system first and thanx for the up Great stuff
,Sabresite,2007-11-21T03:44Z,"yuralovely - You are a fucking peice of shit.  There are several DVD versions out there with full language packs and driver support.  I made this CD version because there weren't any that have Media Center Edition OEM.

phobos37 - the ccd file is a zipped archive with an ecrypted password.  Its part of the program I used to make it, and I don't have the password.

Also the per_seg5.sw_ - If this is damaged, I do not have my CDs anymore and I would not be able to replace this with a good one.  If someone can, please comment here."
,Sabresite,2007-11-21T03:49Z,"Tested Per_Seg5.SW_

Expand per_seg5.sw_ per_seg5.swf

The file passes CRC checks.  The file may become corrupt if you burn it quickly.  Either extract the ISO, or burn it at 1x."
,Sabresite,2007-11-21T04:13Z,"phobos37 - the ccd file is a zipped archive with an ecrypted password. Its part of the program I used to make it, and I don't have the password.

I meant to write that to rodbriggs

phobos37 - If you burned the ISO correctly (and not just the files) then it should boot.  Make sure you have CD-ROM set to boot before the HDD."

,indyan,2007-11-24T12:58Z,how to install with sata/raid hdd?
,gnosticgnome,2008-05-01T21:15Z,"oi. thnx for the torrent. hoe do i seed? i'm on linux here, bittorrent. does it automatically seed when i've finished downloading? do i have to activate the torrent file? or create a torrent file ?anyone? thanx."
,PLuGGPro,2008-05-12T19:29Z,"@envyfusion20 -

That key was one of the first  leaked out, and a lot of people use it as a key just to install, and then change it later, or crack it.  So if your school is using that key, they are most likely doing so illegally.

If you don't believe me, just google the product key... it's all over the net.  Also, I'd wager that you can't find the actual product sticker with that key on it.

Just FYI."
,PLuGGPro,2008-05-12T19:31Z,"@gnosticgnome....

It depends on what torrent client you're using.  Most will start seeding once it's done downloading and continue as long as the program is active, but it depends on how your client is configured."
,boyblue06,2008-05-30T00:38Z,Is the WGA Patch already active in these or do i have to apaly it after install
,iamstretchypanda,2008-07-15T04:59Z,Quality.  I've tested XP Pro Corp and XP Pro Retail. Note i used my own keys as i just use this CD as a cure all install disk for comp repair.  Works as advertised.  I don't believe the WGA patch is activated.  These appear to be legit versions of windows.  Thank you.
,plasmafox2038,2009-01-31T03:31Z,"Sabre, I have an Academic XP Pro SP2 disc I'd be willing to rip for you, but I'm not sure what method to use, I'm sure microsoft has it rigged so it needs to be done a certain way. Give me instructions to do it and I can get it to you when I find the time."
,jay736,2009-02-18T07:59Z,THANKS!!!!!    For this Upload   :D
,john_coller,2009-05-27T22:46Z,"Works!

I have two laptops with legal XP serials.
I have a proper Windows XP CD, it doesn't work. It says the serials are wrong.
I downloaded this, installed the XP Pro OEM version and it worked straight away.

Cheers Guys."

,redryu666,2011-04-22T04:10Z,"thx alot Sabresite; been looking for one of these discs for 3 days now.... read all the comments and DAMN some people just don't understand shit....

TO ALL COMPLAINERS
this was designed for technicians thats why it is 9 in 1.... SOOOOO you should have a product key before hand, you should know how to fit it onto a disc, and you should be able to read the things that pop up in BIG BOLD LETTERS that would answer the other 90% of the questions on here...

This is also my 9th disc cause all the other Windows XP Media Center Edition 2005 downloads and torrents are all 2002 and multiple CDs....

Again....THANKS SOOOOO MUCH Sabresite"
