,advocatus_diaboli_86,2007-01-23T02:01Z,I have problems to pack this thing up. I got messages that says that the volume is corrupt. I haven´t got this promblem until a few days ago. It´s not just this movie. I have these problem whith the two other films i downloaded this week. I havenn´t explored these problems before. Can it be Bit Comet that fucks up or something? I have tried to re-install win rar but it wont help. Does anybody knows whats wrong. Please help. I want to see this=)
