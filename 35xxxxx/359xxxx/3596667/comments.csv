Please release more FLAC here on TPB and on your webpages! We would be glad if you did!
Cheers and thank you again!"
,Musictrade,2007-04-18T01:35Z,"Thanks for the good feedback. Putting the FLAC releases also on Archive is an option, we have so far wanted to save their bandwidth by keeping only mp3s there. We are pleased to hear that our audiophile releases are appreciated and as they have been quite popular we intend to keep releasing them along with the mp3 versions.

with best greetings
