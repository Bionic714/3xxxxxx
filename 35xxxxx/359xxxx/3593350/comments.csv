,yitbos96bb,2007-10-31T06:49Z,"Hi All,

I am having a problem with the program.  I can install it ok.  I can launch TOast.  When I get to the part where I am told to put in the Serial #, the program crashes on me.  It ends suddenly, gives me the option to send a report to apple, etc.  Anyone experience this, did you fix it, or does anyone have any ideas on how to fix it?  Any help would be appreciated."

,larold,2007-11-23T03:52Z,hey i'm having the same problem as yitbos96bb. when i go to put in the serial it crashes and asks if i want to report. in fact the whole reason i went looking for a new toast program was because i updated my OS to 10.4.11 and my toast 7 stopped working. it did the same thing. it would open then crash and ask if i wanted to report. anyone know what's up with this? everything was fine till updated my OS
