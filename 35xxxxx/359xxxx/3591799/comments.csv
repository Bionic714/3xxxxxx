,Rexxxifon,2007-01-07T22:24Z,"4X-AXG. Whoa, resorting to insulting a nationality based on 1 moron is pathetic.

How'd you like someone to call you a Fucking Jew?  I'm sure youy don't speak for the majority of Jewish folk, do ya? Whether he's a fucking moron or not, you shouldn't be calling him a ""fucked up belgian""

k? thanks, bye."
,4X-AXG,2007-01-07T22:26Z,"alright then, let's say he's a disgrace to all the good belgians"

,Dr. Frikadel,2007-01-07T22:32Z,"Na klar ja, ruhig mal meine Kinder...

,Maxpower1985,2007-01-08T01:48Z,"I don´t understand why sombody have problems with a rip? A rip menas somebody has already made the work of unpack for you. The only thing you have to do, is to put the files into the right place.
If you can´t do this, you have not the ability to play with MS-FS and fly any Plane. ;)"

,zippee,2007-01-08T02:08Z,"Many thanks :-)
I prefer rips, it's possible to see what files are going where. Just as long as the file structure has been preserved of course. Some official addon's also are released in this form.
