I've noticed that quite a few people seem to enjoy posting lies about torrents (eg. Licking Hong Anus) ... and of course they most likely never even downloaded the torrent.
In a perfect world people like these should be banned from sites like this one.  But, oh well ... we have to put up with them I guess.
Good luck m8."
