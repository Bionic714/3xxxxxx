,far_isle,2008-01-15T02:13Z,"Been putting out the word about Just Planes Air Greenland.  Forgive me if you have run into this request a few times - just spreading out the alert.  30 folks are stuck at 28.4%.  It's been about 5 weeks, maybe more and patiently we are all hoping for a hero to jump in and save the day.  Anyone and Everyone that hears and helps - Thanks 10,000 times.  PB Seeders are AWEsome.  BEV was requested and less than 1 Day (!) later PB came forward and seeded.  Thnx!"
