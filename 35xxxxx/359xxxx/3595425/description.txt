Another pre-street-date rip from Mr. The Plague. 

The Cruxshadows are a darkwave/goth band. This is their new album, Dreamcypher, which hits the streets on January 16th. Its hit single, Sophia, is track #3.

mp3 files this time. 224 kbit ABR, encoded with LAME, if anyone cares about the nerdy shit.
