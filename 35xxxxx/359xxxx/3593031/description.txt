- release notes ------------------------------------------------------------- -

   Simply beautiful music. You need this record.

   "To listen to Jakob is to journey through the harsh, beautiful, isolated
   landscape of the Hawkes Bay, NZ, that is their home. Swelling but direct,
   beautiful and uplifting yet intense and hard. Jeff Boyle (guitar), Maurice
   Beckett (bass) and Jason Johnson (drums) got together in 1998, to realize a
   musical vision they all shared. The result is nothing short of a beautiful
   contradiction; Uplifting yet dark and intense, both sonically massive and
   delicately complex. Jakob defy definition and while many influences come to
   mind theirs is a unique sound. A sonic landscape. With three albums, Subsets
   of Sets, Cale:Drew & Solace under their belts, Jakob continue to explore new
   musical horizons."
