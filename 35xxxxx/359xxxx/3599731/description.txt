It's been a while since i encoded and Tokusatsu shows/movies so thanks for your patience.
I am going to start with a few Sentai/Super Sentai movies which aired in Japanese movie theatres back in the day.There are a few movies which were basically blown up versions of tv episodes.Please also note that all tokusatsu releases are the original japanese versions with japanese dialogue and NO subtitles.I can assure you that this will not distract from your enjoyment.You will actually learn some japanese in the process.

This is the first movie of the sentai series Goranger which aired from 1975-1978 and comprised of 84 episodes.This movie is a blown up version of episode 6.

I hope you enjoy it.

Please seed once you have the complete file.
