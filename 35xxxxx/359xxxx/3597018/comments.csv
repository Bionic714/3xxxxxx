,IlCattivo1991,2011-07-14T03:43Z,why is this over 4GB when it's only a 60min runtime?
,yahmez,2011-08-18T19:14Z,"The reason for the file size is that this is an uncompressed rip of the original dvd including menus and special features. It includes a one hour video of sound checks and his final concert from his last night alive. This is not must see video for everyone, but die-hard GG Allin fans will want to get this.
