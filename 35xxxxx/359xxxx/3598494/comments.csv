Thank you very much."""

,BlackBeardsDVD,2011-09-22T23:20Z,"alright nice one for the upload.
A:10
V:10

Just had to say there is about 5 or 6 episodes missing...so that sucks.

and anyone giving out about this being slow, a word of advice...look up how to set your settings on your downloader, because if its not on the right settings it takes fucking AGES....i have a 25mb/s connection..and it downloaded in 25 mins(average for 4 gb)

thanks psiharja..but you gotta sort out the missing episodes mate. :)"
,BlackBeardsDVD,2011-09-22T23:25Z,"just checked the files and seen the episodes that were missin, my bad..."
