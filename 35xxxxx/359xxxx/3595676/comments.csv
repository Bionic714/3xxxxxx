,hanz&hank,2007-05-03T18:38Z,same here.
,sedrapedoka,2007-06-03T20:08Z,"i tried mounting it and burning it to a CD.. neither works.. i did the same with other torrents and it won't work either, i know these instructions are simple but i don't get what i'm doing wrong.. do i have to save the iso on my desktop to mount it properly.. it just does the autoplay but nothing begins (because there's no .exe) and then it just opens up the image in windows explorer..."
,TheGoogler,2007-07-18T03:51Z,do you have to download the rosetta stone installer disc and then install this too or does this install the rosetta stone program?
,Silen00000,2007-07-26T18:07Z,"I successfully installed the program using Daemon tools, but when I run the program and search for the language iso., my computer doesn't find anything. I have moved the language iso. to the hard drive and still nothing. Can anyone give me some tips on getting the language packs installed?"
,Rudao,2007-09-07T15:07Z,"Hey Th3Moos3,

The Mandarin Level 1 and 2 only goes to Level 11, Unit 3.  From Level 11, Unit 4 to Level 19, all info is corrupt or cannot be found.  Can you check your data and reseed please.  Cheers for the great torrent though.  I'm using regularly here in good ol' Zhong guo (China). Peace."
,jdhu,2007-09-14T20:35Z,Yes please upload the more advanced parts if you have it.  Really appreciate it.
,coach_hardy,2007-10-20T20:09Z,I have the same problem as some others on here: The installer program doesn't fine the language data. Anybody find a solution?
,dirkxi33,2007-10-24T05:15Z,"Moose, you rock dude!! Thanks!!"
,NeaonBHB,2007-10-25T06:58Z,"Having a problem - The program burned and installed just fine, but once I run it and select English as my langauge, everything, and I mean EVERYTHING shows up in Chinese. I try the lesson but each 'picture' is like 7 words and I have no idea what they mean. Theres no translation of anything, even the names of the lessons are in chinese and I cant read them. What am I doing wrong?"
,SiliconJaguar,2007-11-25T22:34Z,"I too am having the same problem. I do not get anything in English when running the Mandarin Language disk. I select English US, but it still all comes up in the Chinese symbol language. 

Any Idea's how to fix this please?

,neilaroo,2008-01-02T16:37Z,"---""everything is in english""--yes! but that's the way it works--you just get chinese (pinyin or characters) and you have to figure out how the chinese relates to the pictures. There is no translation into english."
,bluecelt1155,2008-01-07T16:17Z,"Hi, when I try to download this file, TPB tells me; ""no input file specified."" Any ideas?"
,Eric090585,2008-02-06T18:01Z,Hey Th3Moos3...Thanks for all the awesome ISO'S bro! Much easier than the other options out there :)
,Finch20,2008-02-12T20:53Z,Cheers mate! Absolutely awesome!
,theleo4u,2008-02-18T18:25Z,"If you like learning chinese download this 

ChineseWord processor this is a fully working trail version.

The only limitation is that the fonts are low res

However if you install Asianfronts for XP or Chinese lang pack for Vista you can cut and paste into word.

This is an excellent learning tool

,Suppozo,2008-02-22T00:48Z,"************************************************************************************************************************
First Off, sometimes the .iso files are and sometimes they aren't recognized in Rosetta. It's really weird. They have to be made correctly for them to work. (Mount the software and using an advanced mounting software use the 'create .iso from CD drive' option. Thats the only way i've succesfully fixed the problem. When you open it, it WILL show up in the language you used; its part of the lesson. Just as when you took Spanish in high school and the fucking teacher wouldn't speak in English at all? Exactly. :) Thanks for the upload Moos3. I needed this one bad. :P

I've managed to install my rosetta stone app that I downloaded, but I have no idea how to install these chinese/mandarin lessons. Can someone explain it to me please? step by step? if you could email me at quajembo@blueyonder.co.uk that would be great. Your help would be fantastic!"

,LindB377,2008-04-14T12:52Z,"Here are Esarhaddon's instructions on how to:
1) Get the Rosetta Stone Version 3 Application
2) Get the latest update for Version 3
3) How to bypass the activation process without calling or connecting online
4) How to install languages

*FOLLOW THEM IN THIS ORDER*

1. Download the version 3 application from http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3852202/The_Rosetta_Stone_Application_(Version_3) and install it.

2. Download the version 3 update from http://thepiratebay.org/tor/4095208/Rosetta.Stone.3.0.57.UPDATE and install it.

3. Download the version 3 patch from http://thepiratebay.org/tor/4095215/Rosetta.Stone.V3.Patch. Put patch.exe in the Rosetta Stone directory at C:\Program Files\Rosetta Stone\Rosetta Stone V3 and double click on it. If you are using Vista, right-click on it first and select run as admin.

4. Download the languge files you want from esarhaddon's page:http://thepiratebay.org/user/esarhaddon/0/1 and mount them with daemon (the easiest to use).

5. Run the Rosetta Stone application and click check for updates later, click on add languages, add the first language, unmount the first language disk and mount the other levels of that language or other languages you want to learn. Do add another language until you have all of them that you want.

6. Click on activate or whatever.

7. The patch will keep RS from going to the RS website and ask if you want to activate by phone. Click on show me how. Enter all Xes for each of the languages listed.

8. RS will show you some numbers to give the person you supposedly are calling. Instead of calling, enter all 1s as if the RS representative had given you them, Once again, do this for all the languages listed.

9. Click OK and RS will thank you for licensing.

This should be pretty straight forward. But beware, you have to find languages that only work with Version 3."

,TDCinprc,2008-05-03T08:27Z,Is this v3 of Chinese or v2?  Thanks.
,thekanknast,2008-05-07T20:57Z,"seeing as this was uploaded in january of 2007, i'm going to guess this is v2.  anyone out there seen the CHINESE for v3?  please let me know!"
,preludexl,2008-05-26T03:19Z,"LindB:

Stop writing that generic fix. This isnt even v3. There are no patches or updates for V2"
,PirateCrim,2008-06-07T16:41Z,"I have just downloaded this Torrent and I've had some of the basic problems everyone else has had.  Here is a quick overview of what I did.

First I dled it and used WinRar and extracted everything to find hundreds of folders and no ISOs.  Then I realized the file was already an ISO and my WinRar was taking the extension by default or something.  So make sure you don't unzip it or decompress it because it's pointless.

Next I did was download Nero (google it) and that's when I realized it was an ISO.  I couldn't manage to burn it to a CD/DVD because something is wrong with my burner.  I saw someone else mention Daemon tools so I dled that (Daemon Tools Lite or something.)

After playing around with the program I still couldn't figure out what was wrong and why it didnt play.  But I had also downloaded the Japanese version and realized it came with an Installation ISO.  So you basically need to download another language (like the Japanese one) that comes with an installation ISO.  I dled this one http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3590082/Rosetta_Stone_Japanese.

Now here is what you do.  

1) DL Daemon tools and run it.  Right click on the icon and go to ""Virtual CDRom..""  

2) Go to device 0 or w/e you have listed there as a virtual CD/DVD drive and click ""Mount Image""

3) Search for whatever installation ISO you downloaded.  Remember, this torrent doesnt have the installation ISO so you need to donwload it from another torrent such as the Japanese one I provided.

4) Once it's mounted I had to go to my computer and right click on the virtual drive.  It had a picture of an earth.  Right click and go to explore, and you should see ""setup"" somewhere.  Double click it and it'll install Rosetta.

5) Now once you've done that, go back to your virtual drive via the Daemon tools icon and click ""mount image"" again.  THis time, mount whatever language you want.  It can be Japanese, CHinese, Spanish, whatever.  

6) Double click on your rosetta stone Icon and the language you've mounted will appear there.

Remember, if you forget to mount your Language of choice via daemon tools it won't appear when you open up rosetta.

I hope this helps"

,SavageRod,2008-07-27T05:34Z,"Thanks TH3Moos3 for the effort.

Next time, please state the version in the description.  I have version 3 and apparently this isn't that version."
,Vikingman1111,2008-08-06T00:27Z,"Well guys, here's the dope. For RS Version 2 you can load a language from the CD; for RS Version 3, you must load the language iso from Daemon Tools or some other virtual CD/DVD player. The new RS Version 3 is configured to only recognize original physical RS disks/files. Once you get used to this, everything is ok. By the way, the RS Version 2 works just fine and is smaller and easier to use. RS Version 3 has some new bells and whistles, but is it really better considering the basic learning motif? I don't think so. Look at the pic, pic the word; look at the word, pic the picture; hear the word, speak the word, etc. It's still the same thing in prettier clothing."
,Vikingman1111,2008-08-06T00:31Z,This Chinese Mandarin (I and II) iso only runs in RS Version 2.
,BlackMaryFlint,2008-08-25T00:14Z,"Thank you. Maybe I will learn Chinese. I learned a little Spanish from the Latin American disc.
Why does everyone want Version 3 anyway? I'm still using version 2, no keys, cracks, or patches needed. If it ain't broke why fix it?"
