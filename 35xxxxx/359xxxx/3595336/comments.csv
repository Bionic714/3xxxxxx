,bollinger109193,2007-06-17T23:44Z,"Hi everybody. Several people reported malfunctioning of mousebuttons when they play Trophy Bass Fishing Hole 2007. We figured out this problem occurs with people that have a non-English Operating System. The game was intended for sale in North America only.

Anyway, there is an easy way to fix this:

    * Open ""autoexec.cfg"" which is located in the TB2007 install folder.  By default this is C:/program files/Trophy Bass 2007/WORK/bin. 
    * replace rangebind ""##mouse"" ""Button 0"" 0.000000 0.000000 ""Shoot"" with rangebind ""##mouse"" ""##Button 0"" 0.000000 0.000000 ""Shoot""
    * replace rangebind ""##mouse"" ""Button 1"" 0.000000 0.000000 ""QuickReel"" with rangebind ""##mouse"" ""##Button 1"" 0.000000 0.000000 ""QuickReel"" "
