It seems to take the directory name, so I renamed the directory but that of course broke the uploads.  This is the second try.  I'll leave this one in place.  Sorry for the mix up."
,fiskg,2007-01-21T01:15Z,"Thank you! Haven't read the books yet but heard they where great, maybe I'll give this a try instead."
,vaghalsen,2007-01-23T07:08Z,thnx
,pingisuggla,2007-01-31T00:46Z,"When you upload something you are supposed to actually seed to. IMAGINE THAT..
this torrent is stone dead"
,timetrips,2007-02-02T03:40Z,"pingisuggla - Sorry, I'm using uTorrent 1.6 and it shows it's ""Queued to Seed"", don't know why it's not working for you, but it also shows it has uploaded 10.6 GB so that is at least 9 successfull uploads.  Keep trying hopefully you'll get it.  (Though getting mad at someone who's at least made the effort, seems a little ungrateful)."
,timetrips,2007-02-02T03:43Z,"All, hopefully other seeders will allow this to continue being available.  I'll be moving at the end of the month so my computer will be unavailable for a while and my new location has a much slower connection so I don't know how much my contributions will be able to continue."
,zirwashere,2007-07-02T09:52Z,"Good copy.  Thank you. I'll seed this for awhile.  

Coincidentally, does anyone else think the narrator sounds a bit too much like Zap Brannigan? Heh."
,sweatersdc,2007-12-23T19:05Z,"Hahaha, he sounds SO much like Zap"
,averyjr,2008-05-22T10:14Z,"96KBPS is a bit much for an audiobook, isn't it?  if the quality were somewhat lower, then the  download size would be much smaller, but thats probably just me being impatient "
,frunns,2008-05-27T13:45Z,"No, it's not too much, it's just fine. A tip for any uploaders though, please mention in description what bitrate it is, it really helps. :)"
,Saitekman,2010-09-10T02:34Z,This is a great quality upload.
