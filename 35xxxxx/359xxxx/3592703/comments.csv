I quote

""Pink Flamingos has panache! It has a free-wheeling sense of daring-do that borders on innocent fun. So, although the movie is so disgusting that I wish it had never been made, it is not a squalid film. And I don't think YOU, the reader, or anyone other than Waters could have pulled that off. It doesn't make Pink Flamingos a masterpiece. It does make it unlike any other film"""
,Straticus,2007-01-10T02:42Z,"Yup, I have El Topo as well, and it's coming...my next 2 torrents here will be 2 more outrageous John Waters flicks, Polyester, and Desperate Living...I also have Mondo Trasho and Multiple Maniacs, but first I have to figure out how to get them from my VHS format to digital...if anybody knows how to rip this, LET ME KNOW! and we'll have the finest John Waters collection available world wide! :)

,Straticus,2007-01-12T02:59Z,"will someone who's already downloaded this and unpacked it please leave a comment making sure that everything is working fine and that the quality is good? I'm brand new at creating these torrents, and still am trying to find my feet :) Just let me know all is well, and there are a LOT more indie cultish films on the way...the next release will be Polyester...

Thanks everyone
