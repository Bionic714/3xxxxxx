[V],camajos,2007-01-18T16:18Z,"No problem, works just fine, Thanks a lot Warman76 
Here is how you do.
Open Kasperky, click ?Service? and there you have the license info (at the bottom). Click on that (the text) and in the window that pops up delete the key you have (if you have any). Then close that window. Back at the Service page you click at ?Activate? (in the lower left corner), the setup screen pops up with some alternatives, choose  ?Apply existing license key ?.
Brows to one of the keys downloaded by this torrent and click next. 
That?s all.
I used the key ?kps_3y_000F8F26.key? and it was good for 3 years.
Again thank you Warman76"
