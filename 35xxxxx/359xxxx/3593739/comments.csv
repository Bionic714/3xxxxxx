,Sangeki,2007-01-10T20:11Z,"THX, a lot!
Other parts would be nice."
,BritneysOrifice,2007-01-10T20:18Z,This one's an installer. Regarding the other parts that were posted to usenet: they are all installers except for Japanese Airports Vol. 5. That one's a rip.

[T],stevekasian,2007-01-10T20:51Z,nevermind - I'm bein a no-reading dumbass! :-p
,baabis,2007-01-10T21:20Z,"Ah thx BO :) Then I'll wait for Vol 5 since that's the only one I'm missing

,FSSR.Keyno,2007-01-11T01:29Z,"thanks...
a heads up!!
if you like to have autogen, rename the files in each scenery folder..Wakkanai_Ph.bgl, Oita.Ph.bgl, Kumamoto_Ph.bgl, sendai_ph.bgl to something like Wakkanai_Ph.bak. The RJKA scenery is fine."
