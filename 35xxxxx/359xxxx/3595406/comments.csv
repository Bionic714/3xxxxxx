,mr.paradox,2007-01-22T01:08Z,"Unrared the file, it comes as an iso. Using any iso application, the message says that it's a corrupt iso and/or corrupt iso. Nero says the block size does not correspond to the image size.Any help on this file considering it took me 3 days to d/l. I'm  little peed off on this crap!!"
,mr.paradox,2007-01-22T01:11Z,"One more thing, I tried mounting it as an image, same crap. Will not play because it's not an image file??"
,odinstorm,2007-01-22T01:27Z,Try burning the unrared file to disc using DVD Decrypter.
,mr.paradox,2007-01-22T01:45Z,"odinstorm, I need your help bro. I've gone into decrypter set mode to iso, created a SAVE folder and browsed the iso file. Can't seem to open/load the file. Any help would greatly be appreciated!!"
,odinstorm,2007-01-22T01:51Z,"Right click the unrared file.  This should then give you the option to burn image to disc using DVD Decrypter. If that doesn't work I'm out of ideas, sorry."
,mr.paradox,2007-01-22T02:03Z,"much appreciated, nevertheless. I will keep trying 'till I get it going. I reading some instructions off doom.Thanks very much!:)"

,suitcasebaby,2007-01-24T20:07Z,"SOME are gonna have an Issue with this Dvd.
VTS_01_5.VOB is the problem.
VTS_01_5.VOB has a audio issue.. One program (VideoReDo Plus) Says the The Audio is of type_ @4800 Yes.. blank No AC3 tag.
Media Info says there is a text codec:

Text
Codec: 2-bit RLE
Now that only shows up on VTS_01_5.VOB 

So Yes this will play on your computer and some Dvd Players but some will have a problem..

Solution:
Load the Image in Daemons Tools.. Fire up CloneDvd2 and rip the files off the dvd image.
The New VOBs will be fine now for burning and playing back on a stand alone Dvd player.

This may suck up a Nuke but its a simple fix kiddies!

all thx 'n kudos go 2 GrymRpr for his comment on tl"
,troia904,2007-01-25T02:41Z, can anybody point me in the right direvtion on how to burn this movie after i download it?
,troia904,2007-01-26T03:19Z,please please please can anybody help?
,djdaan1,2007-01-26T17:10Z,"OK:
extract all the files into an ISO
download PowerISO
right mouseclick on the ISO and use powerIso.
PowerISO is suppose to make a file you can use with DVDShrink
if that doesn't work pls write another comment"
