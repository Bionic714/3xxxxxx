I've been put on suicide watch ever since having the misfortune of enduring this grossly over-rated pile of gelatinous offal.
Avoid.
Good quality download, it must be said."

,coolintorrents,2010-04-04T02:38Z,"This movie has a debut on Portuguese TV and i Love it! Even make me cry, thats a awesome movie and a really good story.

Thanks Deihmos"
,dannychris,2010-04-25T18:56Z,"The Pursuit of Happyness is a touching and inspiring film about Chris Gardner, a sales man of bone density scanners determined to become a stockbroker. The story follows him and his son as he chases his dream often sleeping in homeless shelters and even a public bathroom but never giving up for the sake of his son. 

Its a very inspiring movie with Will Smith and his real life son playing the lead characters and at times I couldn't help looking at my own life where I could at times relate.

,thatonekid13,2012-01-05T22:59Z,"yeah..and evidently the ps3 has taught you to spell soooo good. its called english, and the shitty ps3 is made by people who dont speak it."
,mocoberci,2012-02-08T18:32Z,"@gvin your comment about XBox made no sense... congratulations!!! actually, XBox is not worse, nore better, than PS3, the games are the same, however, I trust XBox more, as it is from microsoft... I have both, so don't offend me!"
,rflood89,2012-04-15T22:35Z,"hey gvim i've got both consoles and ps3 fuckin shit, the control pad (MOST IMPORTANT THING ABOUT A CONSOLE IS SHIIITEE!!!!) thumb keeps slippin of the bastard why dont you get of call of duty aswell and play a real game of halo you dumb fuck, i can tell what ur like without even seeing ya, unemployable fuckin retard and go learn some english cos what your speak is FUCK-KNOWS!!"
,jaketrek,2012-06-18T01:21Z,"Hey retards, why don't you ask yahoo retarded questions, and stop commenting on this post. Thanks. This is to help other users. You can use freemake converter (free small download actually) and convert to ps3 format or 360; even sounds (turn your vid to an mp3, avc, flav, etc. all the formats convertability is listed:
avi, mp4, apple, dvd, wmv, blue ray, (thats ntsc, and dvix, but only ntsc if you burn straight to a disc, and yes you can actually choose to burn to a disc, even choose the double layer, dvd r, dvd rom, dvd rewritable, etc),,, mp3, mpeg, mkv, flv, swf, html 5, android, sony (psp/3) 3gp, nokia, samsung, blackberry, ANNND the best format for YOUTUBE. "
,jaketrek,2012-06-18T01:25Z,"let me correct myself, when you burn a dvd(which has endless options, yet is still simplified and worked for me the first try with inception,), you have the option to save it as a burned file, but will only make a dvix file grouping, or really burn a dvd, and have it in ntsc. You can preview movies, as it doubles as a player, FREEMAKE VIDEO converter is amazing. FREEMAKE AUDIO CONVERTER is awesome too. if it's a duel sound, duel subtitle file, you can choose which one, then preview it, and cut out parts you don't want. WMV is XBOX FORMAT SILLY GOOSY "
,mother_russia_,2012-08-11T11:26Z,i dont know if its just me but like 3/4 of the way through theres some syncing issues
