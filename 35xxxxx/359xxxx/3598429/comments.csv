,asp4dos,2007-01-18T18:01Z,seeding has begun; allocated bandwidth 256 kbit/s ;  come and get it !
,Cable0guy,2007-01-18T18:09Z,"Which version is this (released in 2001 or the earlier one)? NTSC or PAL? Dolby 5.1 or Dolby 2.0? Anamorphic?

Thanks for the upload."
,asp4dos,2007-01-18T18:25Z,"it's a 2-disc anamorphic PAL edition; sound is the original 5-channel ac3. as the anamorphic format ratio has been compressed horizontally to 4/3, i have expanded it to 1024x434 , deinterlaced and done a quality (not size) based encoding to keep it sharp."
,asp4dos,2007-01-18T19:28Z,"you do need a dual-layer dvd-r to store it, and it plays on most modern set-top-boxes; 
just tell me what should be posted in the dvd-r section ?"
,FaderAbraham,2007-01-18T20:26Z,This is DVD-R... Don't be silly.
,Cable0guy,2007-01-18T20:59Z,I think most of us would love it if you upload the entire DVD + Bonus discs as DVDs.
,asp4dos,2007-01-18T22:40Z,not possible. I own the movie as much as you do. 
,asp4dos,2007-01-19T13:36Z,"I've uploaded and downloaded lots of gigs on a mere 7 KB/s connection, so do not underestimate a die-hard pirate; it fits on a dual-layer, so it is dvd-r... 
end of line."
,asp4dos,2007-01-20T00:10Z,"you'd better mind your words; I don't get paid to recode and share movies; I do it for fun, and certainly not for people like you; if you don't like my stuff, buzz off !!"
,snow0069,2007-02-27T03:49Z,"Dear asp4dos :-)
Well, I see you got affended by this jerks there. You know, there are such people everywhere. If there were not, then something was very wrong. These guys should shut their mouths, but they are so genuious, and fail-free. If they were not there, what fun could there be. But remember. There are much more of people like me, and similar, which like what they get, and if they donÂ´t like it, they just drop it without saying anything. I keep all the stuff I download, good or bad. Sure I could go and rent this film and get it that way. But that is no-fun. I even keep the id of whom put it up here on pb.
So let this cows just buhas and let it go in the one ear and out the other. Them who talk like this, are usually not able to do anything. They figure out, that by saying others are stupid, makes them selves some Einsteins, he he. Know what I mean."
,peruvia,2007-03-27T13:03Z,"Any change of re-seeding this please, I'm stuck on 79%.  Cheers"
,asp4dos,2007-03-29T22:29Z,"I'm reseeding, but i'm limited to 7 KB/s, so it will be  SLOW, however it will come..."
,peruvia,2007-04-01T03:07Z,champion thanks mate
,asp4dos,2007-04-06T01:53Z,seeding will be paused from april 6th to april 15th sorry for the inconvenience...

,ChChing,2007-12-09T14:12Z,Hehe! So nobody knows??? To bad......
,asp4dos,2008-03-03T14:59Z,it is the old version. i hate remakes.
,acanthus,2008-04-01T09:20Z,"Great film, one of the very very best, thanks for seeding. But why oh why is it downloading at 5kbs..days, nay weeks of downloading but i am not complaining really. Thanks..asp4dos!"
,kiaora2u,2008-10-08T04:38Z,"Could you plse help a newbie - downloaded the files (2 discs, not used dual layer discs before), but do I have to write the files to one, as when I play in media player there is a sound commentary over the movie.  Is disc 2 where the movie starts? or will it sort itself when I write to dual layer disc.???? Thanks for any help - A Nana"
,asp4dos,2008-11-09T18:47Z,"the movie was on 2 dvds, with an interlude between them. the large avi files contain several audio tracks, and you may need to select the one you want."
,asp4dos,2008-11-09T18:48Z,dual layer dvd (or single layer blu-ray) is recomended so you have all the files in one place.
,Naralli15,2010-04-18T03:09Z,"Thank you :D

,aungng,2010-06-30T13:25Z,"Thanks with great thanks for these kind of Classic Movies, in Excellent Quality. I had seen this movie since I was childhood, and it always refresh my mind whenever I watch it back. But I admitted that this is the first time that I had in pleasure of chance to get full information's like ""The Feature"" and all whole part. {And I had seen my favorite director Mr. David Lean with still good looking young at age.}
They may be gone, (Some) but their talents still remain for all younger generations at this present moment. Thanks again for your great efforts by uploading this kind of Classic Movies.
May God Bless You!"
,Stewy67,2010-12-21T13:24Z,Is this a dead torrent i can't seam to download it?
,floder,2011-03-21T20:11Z,"Chaps there are 17 seeders and you must all have this choked right down. Sadly if I turn my computer off, or close down Miro this torrent loses its memory and I have to start again. Been at it for weeks and still nowhere!! Can't stand Keira Knightly so you guys are the only act in town.
Will one of you please turn up the wick on the uploads for a couple of days?"
,yogibear2508,2011-06-13T05:35Z,The picture is perfect but the sound is terrible. There is 2 different voices through out the movie they over lap each other. It is a waste of time to download this great movie you wont understand it.
,yogibear2508,2011-06-13T05:38Z,The picture is perfect but the sound is terrible. There is 2 different voices through out the movie dont bother downloading it as it is a waste of time for this great movie
