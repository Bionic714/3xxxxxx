info: 

"Dr. Zhivago" is possibly the greatest work of the movie director David Lean; it is an epic movie about the age when the Soviet Union came to be; the historical events become the background of a most romantic story of impossible love. 

Movies like this (and especially the books they're based on) are valuable elements of mankind's heritage; and since its box-office days are over, it should be readily accessible to anyone with a computer, an ISP and a thirst for inspiration!

credo:

"I know you're out there. I can feel you know. I know that you're afraid, you're afraid of us, you're afraid of change. I don't know the future. I didn't came here to tell you how this is going to end. I came here to tell you how it's going to begin.

I'm going to hang up this phone and then I'm going to show these people what you don't want them to see. I'm going to show them a world without you, a world without rules and controls, without borders or boundaries, a world, where anything is possible. Where we go from there, this is a choice I leave to you."
