This is not a real rape. And it's not really incest. It's a make-believe Japanese porn movie, sold over the counter in Japan and in many other countries. Perfectly legal.

I would be more worried dl'g Vista than this Jap crap..."
,uraphake,2007-01-08T01:38Z,"No pedophelia.
No incest.
No rape.

This is make-believe (role playing).
Damn, look at the freaking preview picture for crying out loud!"
,felix222,2007-01-08T06:19Z,"Hey Matte
Why are you surfing here?  To save us? 
I dont think so.
Is it possible, that you want to see these films too, but you dont dare? And you are angry because we do it what you dont."
,mkvlad,2007-01-08T06:54Z,"I've read some of the stuff Matte has written before and frankly... he's an idiot.
He's like one of those tv-evangelist who preach a lot of bullshit but are probably more fucked up then anyone else.
And Matte really believes every single filename that shows up on tpb. =)"
,btisinfestedwithnoobs,2007-01-08T12:22Z,Matte is a disgrace to every damn swede.

,uraphake,2007-01-09T10:01Z,"From that article: ""Ministers have promised to introduce a bill outlawing the possession of images of extreme sexual violence, necrophilia and bestiality as soon as possible.""

Well then, I guess this torrent is excluded because it doesn't have any of that shit. Funny thing, I've not seen any porn with dead people being raped (necrophilia). If it exists, it must be very rare and about as worthy of attention as passing a law against having sex with Christmas tree ornaments.

The idiots trying to legislate in response to nut cases is like those here in the U.S. who blame ""Grand Theft Auto"" for anything and everything. I can remember a case back around 1979 of some guy who killed another guy over a game of Pac Man in an arcade. I always knew that little yellow fucker was evil!"
,zimor,2007-02-09T22:52Z,"New Swedish laws.

The Swedish Police have permission to sniff/read/listen on network/phone trafik to prevent unnatural porn sutch as Childporn, incest, animal (maby in a wile animal), rape etc etc.

It is extremly easy to detect locate and read traffik on the net. They just use programs as Optnet, wireshark and sniffer pro. (Read about this) 

I am telling you this to give you a chance to stop this. Shore public shower cam is exating, but prob not leagal. Stop sharing this shit, Swedish police have the right to trace outside sweden aswell! They prob already have MAC, IP and your names, but they cant use non of them becouse of one reason. It was never leagal to listen to the trafic before.

Once again, remove all dumb material on TPB manly.

But OFC KEEP other porns for me ;)"
