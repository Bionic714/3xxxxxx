,CaPolarBear,2007-01-30T22:57Z,"OK... I'm not sure if there is some level of retardation going on with some people here or what but...

This is a Marvel-produced Iron Man animated film. It is exactly what the description says, not a fake. 

To put the ""rars"" back together you just unpack them with Winrar or whatever, you don't ""put them together"". The program will unpack the whole file as one continuous movie.

Geez.... what is wrong with you people?"
