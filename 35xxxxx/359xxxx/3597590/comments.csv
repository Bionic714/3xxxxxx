,Rhythalia,2007-01-17T15:51Z,It's obvious that this game has language and region lock.
,ghampus,2007-01-17T16:14Z,"So, is this European or US?"
,Nightpath,2007-01-18T05:22Z,THIS IS THE NORTH AMERICAN CD VERSION
,Churchills Dog,2007-01-18T05:25Z,can someone tell me why anyone would want to download this in light of the fact that its online only and you absolutely need a legit serial number?
,Nightpath,2007-01-19T04:35Z,Because there are literally hundreds of people who have bought the expansion and their CD's are more corrupt than US foriegn policy. I'm doing this for my fellow players and to show Blizzard that anyone can do anything faster and better than they can.

Take my case for example..  Got it for xmas, but of course was pre-order.  Was sent to me from the US once they got it (couldn't pre-order to Canada), but UPS comes to my door wanting $42 in taxes and fees, I reject.  Now I download it and when it arrives back in the US, I will phone and ask them to open and read me the CD key.

Moral of the story: UPS blows, torrents are good and can be used for legit reasons!"
,Knood,2008-04-16T18:54Z,US version?
