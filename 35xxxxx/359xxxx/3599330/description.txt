THX DTS DolbyDigital Test Setup DVD:

Set-up DVDs can help you squeeze a lot more out of your new big screen TV or AV receiver 
without calling a professional.Setting up your system by following the user manual is not enough. 
You need something to use as a reference against which to calibrate your system.
Your family videos are now mastered in THX!

Mind you, set-up DVDs do not replace a professional - there are instances when you simply cannot 
do without professional help - especially if you need to open the back panel of your TV. Yet, there 
are many situations where a good quality calibration DVD would do a lot towards helping you 
achieve better picture and improved sound.

The good thing about set-up DVDs is that you do not need to be an AV engineer to use one of these 
calibration discs to optimize the on-screen controls for improved system performance.
