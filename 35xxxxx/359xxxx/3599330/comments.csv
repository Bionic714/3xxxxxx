,117olddude,2008-05-11T21:04Z,"Nice!  Thanks.  No problems burning to a Mac using Toast.  Plays perfectly.  Has Video calibration screens that work well.  Resultant LCD 46"" image much improved.  Nice Audio calibration as well.  As to the link above to a ""better version,"" I found this one much more helpful (and a smaller download to boot)."
,staffel,2008-06-18T20:16Z,How can i burn it? Using a Microsoft  PC? Tried burning it but some files couldnt be rendered. 
,Feiten909,2008-12-27T19:02Z,The DTS tracks are missing.... only 2.0 DD on them.
,ivanrlynn,2009-05-11T06:50Z,"Ya nice upload, not really great deescription.

Not a setup dvd but a rather nice collection of the videos used by the audio standard companies.

O, and its missing the 2 DTS audio tracks..."
,simsize,2009-10-06T19:52Z,"NO DTS Tracks on this one, only AC3 6 channels and 2 channels. "
,evrasno1,2011-09-07T21:46Z,"above comments are correct,the DTS track is absent-only DD5.1 and DD2.0.
the link supplied by newbee01 is indeed the better file(DTS track included)."
