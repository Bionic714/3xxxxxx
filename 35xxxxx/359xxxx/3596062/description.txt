An article on metal-observer.com, about EoD's 'Fergeteg' album:

'...ECHO OF DALRIADA, a young band from Sopron, founded back in 1998, but only since 2003 in this line-up and under this name. In that year they also recorded their first demo, ?A Walesi Bárdok?, in English ?The Bards Of Wales?, realising the famous ballad of Hungarian poet János Arany. 2005 then had the full debut in store, ?Fergeteg?, ?Storm?, and the six Hungarians really unleash a storm here and there.

Folk Metal it is that the guys and girl have chosen as their poison, here and there with a sprinkle of Gothic Metal, but the use of flute and violin show, where the roots lie, in Hungarian folklore. And after a quiet keyboard intro they furiously set out with ?Védj Meg Láng?, with a lot of variety from quiet to hammering double-bass, with cool flute and changing vocals, Laura Binder definitely does not have a soprano, while Andras Ficzek?s a bit rough and unpolished voice might not be to everybody?s liking, yet it has character, while the Hungarian vocals help to convey tons of energy and are truly entertaining!

(...)

Here and there there?s still some bumps and not all arrangements are completely matured, still ?Fergeteg? is a damn good and variable debut that I recommend to all fans of this style and I dare to prophesy that we will hear a lot of ECHO OF DALRIADA in the future! (Online December 23, 2005)'
