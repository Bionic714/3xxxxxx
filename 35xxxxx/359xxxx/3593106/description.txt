Game Info: 

In Homura, you take control of a samurai in a fantasy take on Japan's 
Edo period, as the samurai flies through vertically scrolling shooting 
stages. You can make your samurai shoot, use a screen-clearing bomb and 
perform a slash with his sword. The slash move forms the core of 
Homura's gameplay, as by slashing enemy bullets, you can send them back 
at the enemy. Homura features multi-form bosses and four stages of 
play, with stages one through three branching off into multiple paths. 
The game is based on an arcade title.
