YTCracker (Spamtech) - Nerdcore Hiphop

Bryce Case, Jr. (b. August 23, 1982), otherwise known as YTCracker (pronounced ?whitey cracker?), is a rapper, former hacker, and Internet entrepreneur.
YTCracker began producing rap music in 1998 in the genre that has since become known as nerdcore hip hop. His early work mainly focused on documenting and amusing the participants of the America Online hacking scene. YTCracker is a self-proclaimed "jack of all trades", also making a name for himself as a professional disc jockey, computer programmer, graphics designer and webmaster.

In 1999, Bryce gained notoriety, media coverage, and a hefty restitution bill for defacing the web site of NASA?s Goddard Space Flight Center, along with other government websites. [1]

These defacements launched him into the spotlight, making him a resource for the media, commenting on other hacking-related events, such as the denial of service attacks on Yahoo, eBay, and other well-known websites in 2000.[2]
