If I had to subject myself to an entire mix of Baltimore club, it would probably be this one by Hollertronix\'s Low Budget. I like Baltimore club more than most, but after listening to it for an hour straight, I feel like I should be assembling computer parts or something. But LB ain\'t gonna do you that way. This almost plays like a hip-hop mix except with the B-More beats. He starts it off with a section of versioned club hits including \"Never Scared, Tear Da Club Off, Milkshake, Tipsy, Yeah, 99 Problems, Hard Knock Life, She Wants To Move\" and more. Then he moves into the novelty section with tracks like \"Big Dummy\" (Sanford and Son), \"Uncle Fucker\" (South Park), \"Rick James Bitch,\" and \"Spongebob.\" He ends with short section of classics, including the holy trinity of \"Put Ya Leg Up, Whores in the House,\" and \"Doo Doo Brown.\" The mixing and timing here is impeccable, what you\'d expect from Hollertronix. This makes a bold attempt at being the only Baltimore mix you will ever buy in your lifetime.
