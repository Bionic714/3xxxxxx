,pimpsol,2007-09-27T11:01Z,"I wish people who download free stuff, posted by ppl who actually take a risk doing so, would shut the FUCK up. 

If a download doesnt work at once, or even not at all, chances are the uploader didnt try to be evil to you, but ran into problems. Stop biting the hand that feeds you, damn retards. 

And yes, this one goes out to: Lolita85"
