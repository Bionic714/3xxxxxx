Copy the cracked content located in the \Crack directory on the DVD to your installation\bin directory.

Good luck and enjoy the game now!"

,willc2,2007-03-05T03:22Z,"find the target of the icon that starts the game = file tw2007.exe. Open the crack folder from the install folder and copy the tw2007.exe file from the crack folder to the target folder, overwrite. make a copy of the unzipped files onto a dvd and keep in the dvd drive while playing. good to go."

,poppe59,2007-03-23T13:38Z,"fick det att funka den här filen som är lite större har jag inga grafikproblem med. hur som helst så måste spelet installeras först sen ska du kopiera crackfilen från skivan till en mapp som heter ¨bin¨ där spelet ligger installerad, typ program/easports/tiger woods pga/.  i mappen bin finns massa .dll-filer dom måste in i crackfilen som nu finns i binfilen sen ee det bara att tuta åå köra.

hoppas det inte blev allt för komplicerat."
