,NWE,2007-01-16T17:51Z," bittin - : So this was Yet another spam-attack by the confused virus/trojan/porn spammer.
They're trying to confuse us by telling there are viruses and telling us that there are NO viruses in the comments. Who cares? Download and see for yourself if your antivirus reports!

BSA/MPAA/RIAA/whoever anti-piracy (spammer) tactic:
> Upload appz with virus
> Spam TPB appz comments with false ""virus/trojan warnings"" and fake and perverted statements.
> Using the names of genuine and sincere uploaders, to fool the masses. (thnx gomzi)

Will it succeed? Hmm... At least I download and my antivirus checks, as usual. It is rather pathetic after all..  (and, yes.. i'm aware of the spam-irony :)"
