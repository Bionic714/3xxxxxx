Come on they're trying to confuse us by telling there are viruses and telling us that there are NO viruses in the comments. Who cares? Download and see for yourself if your antivirus reports!

This comment-terror is just so annoying laaameeeeeee. Stop spamming YOU MONEYGREED TRAITOR!"
,streetho,2007-03-03T15:18Z,there is crap anti virus programs that give a virus trojan warnings. this is a clean torrent. i suggest NWE that you uninstall your anti virus program ad look for a good one here at pirate bay such as advast pro and stop giving these damaging false readings that stop good people from putting up quality programs.
