Bark Psychosis is a post-rock band from Waltham Forest, East London formed in 1986. Graham Sutton is the core of the group, supported by a dynamic roster of musicians. The line up for the seminal album Hex was Graham Sutton, Daniel Gish, John Ling, and Mark Simnett. Current members include Sutton, Colin Bradley, Lee Harris, and others. Formed as a Napalm Death cover band when Sutton, Ling, and Simnett were in their teens, they released several singles and EPs from 1988 to 1994. The band released then their first album Hex in 1994. Embedded in lush electronic sampling and textures and accented with electric guitars, piano, and a string quartet, they developed a singularly unique and varied sound.
