Didn't include any info just uploaded so it would be easier to share but here:

Elemental Devastation 1

WoW Outdoor PvP

Filmed on Executus 1.11-1.12 and Frostmane 2.01. Most part of the movie is filmed on Executus. Some pretty old footage, but that doesn't mean it's really good or something, just that I am lazy and don't do that much outdoor pvp.
Most part of the movie has pretty bad quality, that's because fraps didn't use to support recording at 1280x1024 and some effects and editing didn't turn out that good when rendering the movie. Didn't do that much editing because Imo 2 many crappy effects destroys the movie. 

And the music:
1. Rammstein - Wo bist du
2. Immortal Technique - The point of no return
3. Juno Recator - War dogs


I don't have any locks in the movie and that's because:
1. I need to L2P
2. For some reason I had problems finding them outdoors and wanted to release the movie before TBC so started to run out of time (not rly an excuse because I recorded it for so long).
Some of the fights in the movie is just lol, my opponents kinda fails sometimes but so do I.

About my gear mostly rank 13 gear and it doesn't really change any except Spellblade in 2.01 and my spec before 2.01 was 30-0-21 and after 31-0-20.
