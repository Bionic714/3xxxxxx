,chajo,2007-03-27T12:07Z,is this the soundtrack to the departed?
,rennywitt,2007-03-28T00:41Z,no it's a dropkick murphys album
,theblackninja,2007-04-06T22:16Z,"Hey di0rz, you dumb fuck!
Just because one song is featured in ""The Departed"", it doesn't make this album the soundtrack of the movie!
If only everyone could post torrents with proper titles and descriptions"

Thanks for the album i was looking for the Departed sound, and not the ost.. you gotta love that Irish folk music sound :D

theblackninja: if you want that why don't you join a torrent-community? I love tpb for what it is and i hope it stays that way :)

peace out"

No sin there..  Unless the uploader actually thinks it is the departed soundtrack.. "
,rahulsnh,2007-10-30T11:45Z,My suggestion - Many like me will just be interested in one song. Downloading the whole rar for it makes it such a waste. So upload individual files. Makes it easy for other and network can be better utilized for other downloads.
,esle_enoemoS,2009-03-15T20:19Z,"Has anyone even heard this entire album? Sure, ""I'm Shipping Up to Boston"" is the most popular song (featured on ""The Departed""), but the entire album is actually worth the download (if you like bands like the Dropkick Murphys).

Stop complaining. BTW, thanks for the torrent, di0rz. "
