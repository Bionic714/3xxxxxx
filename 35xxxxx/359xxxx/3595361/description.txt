      Annie's mother is diagnosed with acute leukemia. Mary wants to 
      experience her first kiss, while Lucy is getting impatient with waiting 
      for her period. Simon desperately wants a dog, but Annie and Eric are 
      firm in their decision not to let him have one. But Annie takes pity 
      on a dog that was about to be put to sleep, so she rescues the dog 
      from the pound and takes him home. Simon is ecstatic and so, names the 
      dog Happy. Meanwhile Eric enlists the help of a parishioner in order 
      to convince Matt to quit smoking.
