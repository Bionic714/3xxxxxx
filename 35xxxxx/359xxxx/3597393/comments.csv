Help? Could you maybe upload a working version of onscripter or something?"
,k-t-m,2007-01-20T23:21Z,"nevermind, got it to work right after posting... anyone else got a problem, try this version: http://nscripter.insani.org/onscripter.html"
,Cavane,2007-03-22T02:16Z,"I'm having trouble with the game crashing shortly after start-up.  It goes through the Mirrormoon Agreement, as well as the intro to the game, but crashes when the Menu should come up.  The error report says: Autodetect: insanity spirit detected!
 *** can't find file [cursor0.bmp] ***
 *** can't find file [cursor1.bmp] ***
 *** can't find file [image\word\mirrormoon.png] ***
 *** can't find file [icon\0.bmp] ***
 *** can't find file [icon\0.bmp] ***
 *** can't find file [image\title\title1.png] ***
 *** can't find file [image\title\titlebtn1.png] ***

I assume these files are associated with the menu page.  I have no experience with Onscripter, so some advice would be appreciated."
,frostbrand,2007-05-27T21:49Z,"MirrorMoon, the people who translated it, have instructions on how to build the onscripter source code to play the game.

All my friends have played it from this torrent and those instructions just fine :)"
,xychronic,2007-06-28T14:31Z,"Im also having problems with game crashing a few pages after the agreement. 
p.o.i.t your link isnt working 
frostbrand if you can post a link to that instructions or if you can tell it yourself that would be nice"
