,NeverRAR,2007-01-12T23:10Z,"My apologies everyone.
After my brief session of seeding this today my computer I use for downloading/seeding broke down... again (HP is nothing but crap).
Fortunately it seems some people had time to get the whole thing so this shouldn't be a major problem.

I WILL start seeding again as soon as I've reinstalled that machine. Which I will do tomorrow, since it's getting kind of late."
,NeverRAR,2007-01-14T18:33Z,I'm back seeding as of today. After several reinstalls I finally got the comp working decently... for now.
,iCE999,2007-01-16T22:28Z,"Works fine, thank you NeverRAR...

Have you got Phantasmagoria 2 aswell??

Actually I have the original, but I never really got it to work with windows xp..

Maybe you can help me out?"
,NeverRAR,2007-01-16T22:53Z,"ice,
Nope, but if it's an adventure game then I'll sure as hell be looking for it. I'll let you know if I find out how to run it on XP."
,iCE999,2007-01-22T01:02Z,Here is one of them : http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3601014

[T],Knaster,2008-08-31T14:58Z,lol noobs
,Enterhase,2008-09-30T23:37Z,"Great, great upload NeverRAR, thanks. That said, I have the same problem as tikimiw: GK3 doesn't load in WinXP, I just hear the sound from the presentation, but there's no image.

Unlike Kmaster, I don't consider it to be a ""noobs"" mistake. It's a compatibility issue that cannot be easily solved by using Windows' compatibility mode or a solution of that sort. But hey, everyone's welcomed here... uploaders and jackasses alike. Thanks for your help ;)"
,Enterhase,2008-09-30T23:55Z,"Kinda solved GK3's compatibility problems: try uninstalling your video codecs and then running the game. I know, it's a high price to pay and I'm sure there's an easier way, but if you are as impatient as I am... :P"
