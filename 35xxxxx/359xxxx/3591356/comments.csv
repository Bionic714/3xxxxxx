,speakeasy,2007-01-08T19:46Z,Thank you!
,made07,2007-04-28T13:20Z,"Thanks so much!
*This* is the original master, not some shitty remaster. I downloaded mp3's of this original master before and liked it so much that I ran out to buy the disc. But I weren't lucky and got a (compared to this one) very clippressed master. So I will burn this to CD and then throw away my original and put this inside the cover instead. So buying it really was a waste of money because I didn't get what I want."

,BeatleTom,2010-05-03T00:36Z,"Hi Rule,

Wow, thanks to whoever is still seeding in April, 2010.

Nice sound on this CD - not loud and compressed.

Hey Rule, what is the Polar # on the CD?

Thanks,

Beatle (abba) Tom"
