,greylion,2007-01-21T10:58Z,"First episode of Scrubs where I've started webbrowsing in the middle of it, gone back to watching it, yawned a lot, and considered replacing this episode in my collection with an empty file named Scrubs.s06e06.boring.musical.
I'll give it 3 stars out of 10, and that's being generous."
,jooli,2007-01-25T22:26Z,i didn't like it either. to much singing.
