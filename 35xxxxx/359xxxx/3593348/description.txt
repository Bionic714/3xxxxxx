Windows All Versions
--------------------

Thank you for downloading this release. 

WARRANTY
--------
No warranty, whether express or implied, is given.
By following any of the proceedures described in this document, you
agree to take full responsibility for the consequences, financial or
otherwise.

Making Discs
------------
There are three types of file included in this release:
 
- Iso Files: Burn these with any CD Burner.

- IMG/IMZ Files: These are floppy disk images. Create floppies from
  these either with the included (with serial) WinImage executable,
  or another program of your choosing.

- EXE Files: These are executable files. The only ones I left in
  this format are command line exes - they must be called from the
  command prompt. 

Note
----
I have tried to make sure all of the versions in this boot, but
I cannot guarantee that all of them do. As I had to attain them
from various sources, some of the images were created wrong. All
of the files are in tact, but some floppies may not boot.
 
The following versions WILL boot without difficulty:
- MS-DOS 5.0
- MS-DOS 6.22
- Windows 1.01 (Both)
- Windows 1.03
- Windows 2.03
- Windows 3.10
- Windows 3.10=>3.11

- Windows 95
- Windows 98SE
- Windows 2000
- Windows XP
- Windows Server 2003

The rest might or might not work. Have fun!
