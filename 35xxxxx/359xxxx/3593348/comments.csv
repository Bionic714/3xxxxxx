,SpectreMD6,2010-05-18T18:55Z,"why is this torrent at 0 seeds? 
is there a glitch in the statement sharing community, i need to get this torrent and yet again, this community fails to live up to its reputation!
and why is there 4 lech's if no uploader??? suspect that!"
,SpectreMD6,2010-05-18T18:57Z,"the disk problem, did you check all disks and see if the disk file is there, all it has is ""disk 2"" the id for it, if not, theres the problem, if it is, then  redo 6.22 and confirm its all in the right place"
