Shaun isn't having the greatest of times. The staff at the
TV store he works in don't take him very seriously as
temporary boss; his girlfriend Liz has had enough of always
meeting at the 'Winchester' Arms along with his yob mate;
and his relationship with his dad - sorry, step-dad - remaims
heavily fraught. And now the undead have risen and are
spreading their zombie curse to everyone they can get their
teeth into. Just doesn't seem worth getting out of bed some
days.
