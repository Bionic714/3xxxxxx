,starlets,2007-01-10T20:28Z,BTW  does this work over LAN ?
,MadMat666,2007-01-10T23:38Z,it's always slow at the beginning and unfortunately I don't have a super-hiper :P fast connection... :( only ~2mbit/s up
,Astro833,2007-01-13T08:47Z,"How do you install the patch? I click on the patch.exe and nothing happens.

Also, during install, my security program reported that dxdllreg.exe ws trying to register itself as a startup autorun process which is typical of trojan malware."
,MadMat666,2007-01-14T18:17Z,"Ok, I must admit I was wrong. After playing it a while I can only say that it's going to be one of the best rts ever. The only thing i can bitch about are the reqs of this game. It's killing my pc (a64 @ 2.66, 1gb , 7900gs @580@1640) in a sec. I know that my machine isn't high end but i also know a lot of people who have much worse specs... I hope that the final version will be a lot better optimized than this beta and if so i will definitely buy it."
,GERwAld,2007-01-15T17:31Z,"What is the BETA KEY?:S
Please write  the key"
,Italiano,2007-01-16T11:26Z,I can't get the patch to work >.
,MadMat666,2007-01-24T11:07Z,"I don't know what to comment. U just install the game, than copy the folders from the patch to the game dir and after this apply the patch.exe. If the game doesn't work after this, it's at least weird... I don't know what kind of different problem you might have."
,Morroth00,2007-02-04T12:42Z,"Sorry to break your dreams, MadMat, but if you'd like to play the full game with decent graphic, you might consider stealing Blue Gene or break in to NASA to play."
,LordExide,2007-02-05T22:33Z,"IÂ´ve copied the patch-files to the isntallation dir. But, it wont start, it still asks for a CD-key. What am I doing wrong?"
