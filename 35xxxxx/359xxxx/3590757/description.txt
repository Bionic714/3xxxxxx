In 2006, Music For the Masses became one of the first Depeche Mode albums (along with Speak and Spell and Violator) to be released on a special 2-Disc SACD/CD Hybrid + DVD format, in the vein of their 2005 album Playing the Angel, which had a limited edition SACD + DVD release. The format was the same as Playing the Angel\\\'s, the first disc had a special digitally remastered version of the album, while the DVD had the album on three formats (PCM Stereo, 5.1 Surround Sound and DTS 5.1) plus bonus tracks, and a documentary on the album. 

The documentary, a 37 minute short film called Depeche Mode: 1987-88 (Sometimes You Do Need Some New Jokes) is an extensive look at the album, featuring commentary from a wide variety of people, including the current Depeche Mode, former member Alan Wilder, producer Dave Bascombe, Daniel Miller, Daryl Bamonte, Martyn Atkins (who came up with the loudspeakers idea for the cover), Anton Corbijn, and others. The documentary features new facts on the album, and also an extensive look at the movie 101.

The rerelease came out April 3, 2006 in Europe. The US version was delayed to June 2, 2006 and will only be available on a CD + DVD format, with no SACD. The DVD on all the versions are region independent however, so one can simply import the SACD version (provided, of course, the buyer can play DVDs that are in the PAL format, as opposed to the American NTSC format).
