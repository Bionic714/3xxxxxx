,Yahnke,2007-01-17T06:14Z,Could you maybe try putting it all into one file instead of twenty some?
[T],Malekay,2007-01-17T07:15Z,"Kamara: Thank YOU, for giving yahnke a leason =)"
,nuffi,2007-01-17T07:52Z,this is episode 14!!! http://www.tv.com/stargate-sg-1/show/185/episode_listings.html?season=10&tag=season_dropdown;dropdown;9
,mwdarwish,2007-01-17T10:22Z,"Great upload, but there seems to be a gap between E11 (the quest II) and this one. I checked the SG-1 site, have they released E13 before 12? 12 is ""Bounty""

any information guys?"
,homer97,2007-01-17T10:24Z,Ermh episode 12 is called Bounty. This is epsiode 14...
,mwdarwish,2007-01-17T10:27Z,"Oh yeah just verified Ep names, so Ep 12 and 13 are not released yet

I thought it's my old age :D

anyway, thanks again for the upload"
,klossen,2007-01-17T11:33Z,Haha no bounty is 14 check http://www.stargate-sg1-solutions.com/wiki/Season_Ten
,EarlHare,2007-01-17T11:48Z,"Bounty is Episode 15 according to that site.....
well arent you all a bunch of misinformed people today :) one person complaining about rar format (probably because he wants to preview the file as he downloads it to check he hasnt seen it so that he doesnt waste time downloading) and another bunch of people squabbling over which episode this is.

Let's all take a moment and think this through shall we? if you have (like me) been downloading your fix of stargate every week, then you should by now realise that they are being uploaded in the same order as they are being aired so the possibility that this is in fact episode 14 and that you have missed out two weeks due to being trapped by umm... lets say... a time dilation device similar to that found in the replicator homeworld, is pretty damn slim :)"
,hoku12345,2007-01-17T12:37Z,Whell said EarlHare 
,BBu,2007-01-17T14:53Z,"rar-files will kill p2p.

I don't seed rar-files, I delete the torrent immediately after the download is complete.

Why? Because I don't wanna keep the same file twice on my computer. It's a fucking waste of space."
[T],Malekay,2007-01-17T15:21Z,BBu: so go back to limewire then
[T],Malekay,2007-01-17T19:01Z,"wodez: no, itÂ´s not about that"
,Yahnke,2007-01-17T21:13Z,So enlighten us Malekay...
,albanen,2007-01-17T22:39Z,"looks like kindergarten here,bubhuuhuhuhuh mammammaaa

Well ill seed it anyway at least to 5.0 when im done dl it:-))"
,qriff,2007-01-18T00:30Z,"For complaining haxors with your single file torrents and what not, all limewire/emule/kazaa superseeders with your adsl-clothesline:

if you dont by now understand, why, then just accept ""Hallowed are the Ori..."""
,psychah,2007-01-18T00:56Z,"yup, this episode makes no sense

mind the gap folks!

if you're like me, you'll wait for the other ep's to make sense of this one"
,webrosc,2007-01-18T01:20Z,"i watched this last nite on sky 1, and it didn't make sense either, thought i'd missed a week.
but if you look on imdb it says line in the sand is ep 12, this is ep 12, so they seem to be in order but just don't make 100% sense"
,raivenloth,2007-01-18T04:44Z,"Since some need to be enlightened - There are other ways to download besides bittorent where many small files with .rar & .par extensions files are a much safer (less chance of corruption) to download.

And yes rar is great for them, but like many I will delete the rare files and keep the uncompressed file.  In the case of files I download that are split I am a leech.  

I didn't download this one as I didn't care to leech.  This is BT its not usenet or any other form of distro you nolonger have to split it into rare.  If you got it off usenet great thanks for sharing it with BT users, but be considerate to all BT users and uncompress it before making the torrent so that those of us that don't wish to leech and don't want to piss away disk space can share.

So for those of you slamming the people that actually want to share and not piss away diskspace because the uneducated decided to be lazy and not uncompress before posting the torrent there is your education.

But in the end Thanks for the torrent Malekay.
"
,raivenloth,2007-01-21T02:45Z,"lets expand that, I have a number of other things I seed as well, but lets take a season.

350M*24 episodes=8.4G
Lets take that a little further
10 seasons 84G
Granted the 10th isn't finished, but there you go 1 show and you already have over 160G which is  over 1/3 of your nice shiny new drive.  

Personally my server has several drives.  I had to build a new server because my old Mobo ran out of controller slots for drives.  I do high res photography and I fill up my drives with work, as well as some of my favorite DVD'S that I have backed up onto my server.

But really how much disk space does the average Joe have? and is it worth taking up 1/3 of their drive because someone was too lazy to uncompress the file before uploading it?  In general most people will download, uncompress and delete the rar files.  So as was stated earlier in the thread the overall idea of rar in bittorrent will kill the community as MOST people that download will remove the torrent because they want to save the space.  Its hard enough to get people to seed as it is, why make it worse by doubling the file sizes. Perfect example is games.  4gb download for some, if rared thats 8gigs, then add another 5 for the install thats 13 gigs.  lots of wasted space.

Anyway worthless arguement, its been beat to death time and time again, with decent reasons for both sides.  In the end though I and many others still believe that rar while a boon for things like usenet is a big bane for BT.
"
,viper_h,2007-01-21T06:21Z,"wow is it really so difficult to explain the benefits of uploading a 28-file torrent instead of a single file one?

instead you say things like ""if you don't know why then you SUCK ASS!! LOLOLOL"". This is called ""elitism"" and it makes you look even more of a retard than the people who asked in the first place.

If you're not going to help by explaining why the file has been split up, then frankly, shut the fuck up and go back to usenet.

As for torrents that are 28 files or somesuch, i don't bother with them. I see no point in them either and think they're a waste of time. Idiots who upload torrents like this don't deserve the downloads and so i don't bother with them.

Just a note to you wankers who upload this shit btw, we're not on 56k any more, we can't put the individual files onto floppy disk and trade parts of files with our buddies. So grow the fuck up, and if you're going to release a torrent, at least compile it into one file first.

It's like those dumb shits who release the source code for programs, but don't compile it themselves. ""LOLOLOLOL!!! U R 2 DUM TO COMPILE MY PROGRAM... but so am I so i suq"". WHat a fucking waste of time."
,Mnemisis,2007-01-21T10:02Z,"Personally, i dont download rar files anymore either.  Even 10 years ago, on my modem, I hated it with a passion, get to number 50 or something, and it would dissappear or be corrupt.  I've had to manually edit many a code to try to save a rar file, not always succesful, nearly, but I have never downloaded an iso or avi straight-up that didnt work.  All things aside, that sould be the most important fact: rar's get fucked up."
,nQben,2007-04-08T01:29Z,"hmm.. take you disgussion to another place and let life go on.. since someone is really getting buhu over this... download this or dont.. as simple as that, you dont go buying a car og candy you dont like.. then dont download something you dont want

ty for the upload malekay"
