,riku45100,2007-04-06T03:12Z,"why do people go that far and call people name, I was stuck on 82% for about a month. Now IÂ´m back to 0% because I had hard-drive blow, so stop giving out you may never get this file, go out and buy if you want that much."
,shunthut43,2007-04-13T11:45Z,"nightmoods i know ppl can be a bit of a t*** when it comes to this sort of thing, but putting a public Email address of a person on this kind of site is not nice.

think of all the spam and crap he will get now!!!"
,shunthut43,2007-04-13T11:47Z,"^^^^ ooppss!!! ment private email ^^^^

,danasteroid,2007-04-30T20:01Z,"email this ,& email that.Calling people names,etc....How terrible,.....................but..Im guessing this kinda confusion is what can happen when a torrent is TEASED ,& NOT seeded for more than 1 day........................Listen folks- - - - - - - - - - -FORGET this torrent!!   
It is not happening  
PILOT121 , you've made a good name for yourself here ,& I'd like to say a big, & warm Thanks! on behalf of all of us.
