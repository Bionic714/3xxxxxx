,garminfriend,2007-01-22T07:58Z,"topo austria does ONLY WORK ON A PC. it is NOT POSSIBLE to submit maps to a gps-unit like etrex.
what is the sense of a torrent like this???"
,B.A.Funky_Monkey,2007-01-22T14:42Z,The reason it's useful is that you can still use them on your PC in conjunction with a Garmin GPS.  The Topo maps are a bit less useful than others ...since you probably won't be hiking with a laptop.

How would uploading work? Could you please exlain.

Thanks!"
,hugo5,2007-03-18T23:40Z,"By the way, the above code is not working. There is no error when I try to unlock, but the map stays locked in Mapsource.

So neither GPS nor PC use with this one. :-/"
