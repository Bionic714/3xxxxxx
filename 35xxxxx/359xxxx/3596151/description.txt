This is probably the most uptodate map of Western Europe. Using KeyGen (if needed) can be used in all GO, ONE and Navigator 6.XXX. It is not suitable for v5.XXX. It has Isle of Man and the whole of Ireland with many road corrections. Certainly it covers a lot of Great Britain roads that where wrong on previous versions, including v660.1223

For me, it is the best map yet
