,ripper007,2007-01-19T11:38Z,what's the correct directoryname on the sd-card? TomTom starts and found no Map if i put the files in a directory named western_europe-map
,wintergre,2007-01-19T15:42Z,"Same question as Ripper007;
Can someone please give a discription on the directory structure, which files to place where ? Btw, this download contains more/other files than my original 'map' folders on my TomTom One..."
,eisaks1,2007-01-20T19:30Z,"Just remove the old map on the SD card, and copy the map from this download(Western Europe v660.1256) with the files in the root on the SD card. Remember to take a backup before you do this."
,fransfl,2007-01-21T10:49Z,"This map was already posted here, and it's better seeded: http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3585390/TomTom_6_Western_Europe_660.1256.zip

,timo3,2007-04-21T15:38Z,"Hi - I don;t have room on my tomtom's sd card - If I get a 2 GB chip, is it as simple as copying the files onto the new chip and putting it in? Or do I need to take some of the info from the manufacturer's card?"

,doggybuzz,2007-06-18T11:25Z,"Hello everyone,
I've downloaded this torrent. It isn't entirely clear whether this can be used in a TomTom One (v2) device. Can it? If so, could anyone provide some simple step-by-step instructions on how to do this without wrecking my TT1? I do not want to use this on a PDA (I don't have one) just a TT1.

Cheers."
