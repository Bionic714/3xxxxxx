If you do, I'll monitor and seed it for the next year. I would hate to see anything DOUG (dare I use the word) die.... Doug still has a great following and a forum dedicated to him by those who loved him and enjoyed his music. If you ever met the man, you would understand why I'm writing this... He was larger than life.
Thanks for the Popaganda torrent also...
Thank-you in advance for your co-operatiion and kindness.
Bart."
