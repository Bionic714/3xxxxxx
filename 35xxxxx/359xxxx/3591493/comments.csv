,wwervd316,2007-01-07T21:42Z,"Come on ppl just wait one more week, dont let the ratings drop because you feel like watching it now. Remember shows run off of ratings and the cast and crew worked a real long time on this. Long live 24! "
,Sonikkua,2007-01-07T21:49Z,I don't think 24 is in any danger of ratings problems. And the people grabbing this are probably 0.00002% of the audience ;)
,wwervd316,2007-01-08T21:13Z,"I know 24 has great ratings but im just saying that when you download this now, you will not watch it when it airs. If you really like 24 you should watch it and support the show"
,the-tank,2007-01-08T22:15Z,"Hi,

,Wwwildthing,2007-01-09T20:57Z,"4.4 gig to download, another 4.4 gig (disk space) to unrar... you need almost 10 gig free just to get this back into it's original form... it should have been posted as an ISO.

,Xeryusonline,2007-01-10T12:50Z,"The only way the ratings for 24 will be affected is if those with Nielsen boxes don't tune in.

If you don't have a Nielsen box then it makes no real difference if you don't actually watch."
,pollux32,2007-01-17T18:11Z,"dumb question, but how do i rebuild the files so i can watch them?"
,Jouko123,2007-01-18T14:59Z,"you can buy this dvd in usa and canada...
