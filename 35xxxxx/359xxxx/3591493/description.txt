How fuckin' cool to own on dvd the first 4 episodes preair.

At the end of Season 5, Jack Bauer was kidnapped, beaten,
and taken captive in retribution for his involvement in a
raid on the Chinese Consulate eighteen months earlier.
Now, there?s a new president, Jack Bauer is missing,
and the U.S. is under siege from terrorist attacks more
threatening than anything we?ve ever encountered!
There is only one thing that can save the nation
- Jack Bauer must die.

Get ready for the most explosive, the most terrifying,
the most heart-pounding four hours of television ever.
Included on this exclusive DVD are the first four hours
of Season 6 - 6:00 a.m. to 10:00 a.m. - and a
never-before-seen 12-minute preview of the next
explosive episode. And you thought your rush hour was tense...

Enjoy .
