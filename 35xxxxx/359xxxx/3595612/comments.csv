,up4anything,2007-01-17T00:27Z,"Thank you! This is great! Any chance of the rest of the videos being posted?

Thanks, again, very much."
,Roscoe91,2007-01-17T00:58Z,"I have the other DVDs, I have not gotten around to burning them yet into ISOs.  Plus my upload is slow and takes days to get seeds."
,rfi999,2007-01-17T20:53Z,Please put up the rest as well... it is okay if it takes some time to dl. Thanks!
,TrevorChadwick,2007-02-28T12:47Z,"Thank you Mr Roscoe for your time and effort in sharing this with others.  Flying is far too expensive in England, so your generosity is appreciated.
Very best regards,
Trevor"
,ereich,2007-03-28T17:39Z,Nice! Is there anyone that have the king school movies for the instrument ?? it would be nice to get them :)
,My-IT-Guy,2007-03-29T14:46Z,"WOW - a huge thanks to Roscoe91!!!! This is an outstanding seed!  Rare, complete, available, and not a glitch.  My eternal gratitude is your's Roscoe.   -- If anyone has the King Flight School supplemental videos - they would be a great add-on.  I'm talking about the individual videos on instrumentation, navigation, IFR/VFR, Comm, emergencies, weather, etc.. This info is on this set of DVD's, but this is for training purposes.  The additional videos cover real world events and such. -- If no one posts, I just might buy em, and post myself - since Roscoe was kind enough to empart the Big Fish -so to speak.  Thanks again -- I highly recommend this series to the flight enthusiast in training or veteran!"
,Snyfox,2007-07-09T19:59Z,"Thank You Roscoe91! I appreciate your time and effort sharing this.

,joebob1999,2007-07-11T09:57Z,Anyone else having problems with this one?  I've tried to play and install on several computer without any luck (both auto and manual install).  
,2nz6dckr7w103yp,2007-08-17T22:21Z,"Does anyone know where I can obtain the Instructor Sign-Off form for this program?

I want to complete it but need the sign-off form to take to my instructor when done....

Thanks for all the help and thanks for the great upload!"
,Roscoe91,2008-02-07T03:12Z,"joebob1999, just use VLC player to watch the DVDs or burn the iso with your favorite burning software.  I use Nero or DVD Decrypter for burning.  Also download the latest codecs from Combined Community Codec Pack.  Hope this helps."

,tardy007,2008-07-27T18:30Z,"Anyone else having problems?  I created a DVD from the ISO, but for whatever reason the ""unload.exe"" doesn't do anything.  Anyone else having problems?"
,K1L0GR4m,2008-09-15T14:53Z,"u don't install anything, just open the iso file with videoLAN player (VLC) ..."
,smbdygnnagethurt,2008-09-16T00:08Z,"finally completed.... the dvd works for me.

does anyone here hold a PPL or maybe working towards one?? any advice or warnings?

would really like to hear from someone.
"
,macho718,2008-09-24T02:48Z,"smbdygnnagethurt I am currently working on my PPL.  If you are looking into doing it my biggest recommendation would be to purchase the material that your local flight school is offerings (i.e the jeppesen starter pilot kit) it is a wealth of information and all the answers are in the material in some form or fashion. and lastly enjoy yourself because it is a blast, especially your first flight. and to Roscoe 91 this download was much appreciated.  Thank you..."
,snowcat24,2008-11-17T09:02Z,"If you want the DivX version, it's part of the master collection I posted. Thanks to Roscoe91 for providing the originals!
