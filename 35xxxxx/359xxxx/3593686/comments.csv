,zuhair25,2007-01-10T22:58Z,Is this a funny movie or a waste of time and how is the quality? Can someone give a comparison to the laughability!

,emanmb,2007-01-18T08:41Z,"DAMMIT!!!!  Why can't uploaders state whether their flicks are PAL or NTSC?????
Jeez that pisses me off as I now have one more video in PAL and we use NTSC here.  I took my chances as there is no info here as usual.
Grrr.
Oh ya...the quality is good otherwise"
,shagster,2007-01-18T14:01Z,emanmb stop moaning just change the format from pal to ntsc ya silly cunt.
,carL^,2007-01-21T12:28Z,"I dont see the point of releasing another Borat screener, this is just like the swesub screener, only it has been released much later"
,-Tomce-,2007-01-22T03:42Z,What does it have for subtitels??

,randomguy12,2007-01-28T20:27Z,"I don't want to waste my time. Is this good quality? Does it have English subtitles for the parts when they speak 'Kazak'? Does anybody have screenshots?

How's the video and audio quality? Please answer me.  "
,Robinhero,2007-01-31T09:29Z,"""WHAT!!!!? Is Borat and Ali G the same guy? REALLY?
Come on dude...seriously?""

Are you kidding me. Does anyone REALLY believe that Borat is a REAL person?!?
FFS talk about being naive...."
,duluoz13,2007-02-02T07:12Z,"okay, so i'm new to this and am an ""idiot who doesn't deserve to have computer or breathe air,"" etc, b'c i don't know what's going on here... but i've downloaded this and the file names are brt-borat.r02, brt-borat.r03, etc, and i cannot open them with media player classic, winamp, or windows media player. how do i convert these files to something i can use/view? thanks in advance for any useful advice..."
,shoeshoe,2007-02-05T07:23Z,"hmm ... weird. I thought I posted here, but this is NOT a DVDSCR - it's the exact same thing that was upped by PUKKA before. The audio on this is truly shitty.

I wonder is someone deleted my last warning? Maybe I just imagined posting it."
,sandasandasanda,2007-02-10T14:41Z,"The most stupid person here is Robinhero. Dopilopus was not serious, he knew that Ali G and Borat is the same person, it says so in the character facts on all the sites, Sacha Baron Cohen.
(if he didn't knew that, Dopilopus is a retard av Robinhero is pretty smart, but I doubt that)"
,geekyfirecrotch,2007-02-11T21:19Z,The audio is so shitty on this one.. it's like off by 20+ seconds.. sad because the video quality is excellent.. to hard to follow along because of the sound.. don't bother.
