It is French Colonial Vietnam in 1929. A young French girl from a family that is 
having some monetary difficulties is returning to boarding school. She is alone 
on public transportation when she catches the eye of a wealthy Chinese 
businessman. He offers her a ride into town in the back of his chauffeured 
sedan, and sparks fly. Can the torrid affair that ensues between them overcome 
the class restrictions and social mores of that time? Based on the semi-
autobiographical novel by Maugerite Duras.
