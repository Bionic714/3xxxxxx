Jeppesen IFR charts use a notation that is different from the NOS/TC standard chart format. Many operators prefer the Jeppesen layout for its high-visibility graphics, and the intuitive layout. Some classroom time is required, however, to learn the different format. This is a useful CD presentation of the Jeppesen system, with the convenience of the CD format, but it lacks the DVD convenience of interactive detail, interactive review, and menu selection. It\'s main objective is to explain the format and notation of the various types of Jeppesen charts. The CD content includes Approach & Airport charts, SIDs & STARs, DPs, and Enroute charts. The CD offers a complete chart training package for operators using the Jeppesen chart system.

The Jeppesen Chart Training CD is similar to the now discontinued FlighTime Chart VHS video series, but produced on a single CD video. It is designed to be viewed using a conventional CD player and a television set. However, it may also be viewed using a PC with a CD-ROM drive. Total running time is approximately 2:20. Jeppesen also offers a DVD version of this same material with interactive review questions at the end of each section.
