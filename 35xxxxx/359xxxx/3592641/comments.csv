,Moldylocks,2007-09-09T03:17Z,Ahhh yea if some people could start seeding it would be nice =)
,RelaxedAtmosphere,2008-05-21T11:11Z,"i plan to seed this permanently after it's done. i have an extremely stable T3 which i can get around 3-4mb/s both ways... y'all should be really happy.

actually, once they're all done, i'll seed all 7 seasons along with x-mas special and the movie.

Peace out, y'all"
