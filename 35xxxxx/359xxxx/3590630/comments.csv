,kludge420,2010-01-08T18:15Z,"Let's play, ""Spot the logical fallacy""

Spirit_Helper: ""Note the insolent foul mouthed commentators above. These kind of supporters that Dawkins has show what his real worth is - worse than nothing. He merely tries to persaude the sort of sick conflicted people who had commented on this page that they are OK. ""

Guilt By Association, Composition (Part to whole): Even if we accept the premise that Dawkins supporters are ""foul mouthed"" and ""sick"" that has nothing to do with Dawkins himself.

Spirit_Helper: ""And where is his genius? You have to invent something to be a genius like Einstein or Newton or Darwin.""

Ad Hominem (and untrue): You do not have to invent something to be a genius but even if that were true what does that have to do with the information? Nothing. In addition the statement is false in that Dawkins has invented theories on evolutionary processes like how you can develop an eye bit by bit thus showing, logically, that irreducible complexity is an invalid argument.

Spirit_Helper: ""What has Dawkins done of any value apart from slag off God, and tell 'free people' they have no right to believe in one? He is an arrogant, ignorant, insolent intellecutal tryant, as are the vast majority of his fans, as these comment here prove.

Ad Hominem ad infinitum: Address the information not the man.

If you wish to further your cause you must argue logically and not from emotion. As a true skeptic I've tried to argue both sides of the equation but when attempting to argue for Intelligent Design you get stuck at step one, show me the proof.  Evolution on the other hand has a virtually inexhaustible supply of evidence that builds on itself. In addition when new data comes up it fits into the puzzle very well. There has not been one piece of evidence to disprove evolution.

The only kind of evidence we found that disproves anything never disproves evolution but instead simply disproves a hypothesis we had on an evolutionary mechanism or usually a branching we incorrectly hypothesized.

In closing, an agnostic atheist (which is what Dawkins is, as am I) does not say there is no God. We simply say, ""Show me the proof."" Though we can say that there has been no proof whatsoever in the thousands of years of recorded history and that in itself is fairly good evidence that there is no omnipotent being or beings as describe in ancient bronze and iron age texts such as the Bible, Rigveda, Akilathirattu Ammanai, Quoran, The Book of the Dead, or any other religious text.

So, show us some proof first. Then we'll listen. And saying, ""The bible says it's true because the bible is true because it says so"" is not proof. It's a circular argument.

If there is a God I would think she would want you to argue using reason and logic not emotion. Do yourself and your religion a favor and at least learn to present your arguments in a rational, logical way so your message is heard instead of your dislike of the opposing argument."

According to the 'smelly' ToE (Theory of Evolution), all diversity of life can be traced back to 'common descent'. However, in all of the thousands of years of recorded history and the billions of years of fantasized history (make-believe), not one shred of proof has ever surfaced supporting the magic story of 'common descent'. Amazingly, cockroaches remain cockroaches and dodo birds...well, they just die off.

(For further proof, read about the coelacanthe fish and how this 'dinosaur' fish disproved completely the stinky ToE)."
