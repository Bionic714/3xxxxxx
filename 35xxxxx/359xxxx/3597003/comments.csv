Candy lives in the world's most boring city. She yearns for something else and she will be heard when she was brought to Abarat, a vast archipelago where the 25 islands is an hour of the day was the twenty-fifth time the island is outside time. Candy begins its journey on the island The large head and finally to Gorgossium. Candy begins to realize that it is not the first time she is in the Abarat, and that she is there to save the islands.
