I cant dl this even if there are 1 with 100% and some with 50-90 % and some of my connections are grey? whats that all about?

Anyway, I found a similar pink at isohunt, managed to dl that put cant wiew it. Its the wrong size or something. 

the other 3.7 gig jeancdg uploaded works for me, but I have to first open it with ultraiso and then burn it with nero, or se it with my vlc mediaplayer.

At first the sound was terrible, but after some changes in it was really good,(exept the first 5 minutes). I think its the arena noice thats the problem.

Anyway, the settings I did at my computer where that I changed my soundcards settings to vokal, and I changed the vlc players settings to live and I put on some filters but I have now idea what this filters do, but the sound did get better.....
