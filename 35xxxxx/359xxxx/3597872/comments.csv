,Azgarde,2007-01-18T20:01Z,"Episode 12 is really episode 10. They needed a two part series for the mid season final. So this episode (18) is actually 17. If you dont believe me, theen watch 12 again. I think it is Rodney that says that the stargate bridge is not yet finished. Hope this clears up the controversy. Now you can all go and renumber your episodes. 

Peace."
