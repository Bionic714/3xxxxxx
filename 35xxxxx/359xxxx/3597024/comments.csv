,ektakrome,2007-03-31T02:44Z,"THANK YOU, and BIG THANK YOU to the AiR team."
,artytorrent,2007-10-03T15:55Z,"Like a super-charged TB-303. This is tasty. Fairly simple to install too.
UNRAR everything in the torrent on to your HD and use the Setup.exe to put the dll in your VST plug-ins folder.
Run the Keygen to create a regkey. When you load up an instance of the VSTi in your Sequencer app, it will ask for the regkey. Browse to where it was created on your hard drive. Ta da! Now enjoy the acid sounds! :)"
