,coolbiker,2007-01-16T14:57Z,I dont want no stinkin parts too slow if this is functional this is a blessing due to basic version coming as 4 disks.
,niaxilin,2007-01-16T16:46Z,"Works great! Thank!

Extracted the NRG using WinRAR. Mounted the image using DAEMON Tools. Installed this enUS 2.0.0 expansion on my enUS 2.0.5 WoW with no problems. Patched back up to 2.0.3 then to 2.0.5 and it's playing fine."
,niaxilin,2007-01-16T16:50Z,ignore the RAR part of my last comment. it's ready for mounting right out of the box :)
,HappyMojo,2007-01-16T20:05Z,"finally one that looks legit... downloading now, sorta slow though lol :P"
,HappyMojo,2007-01-17T09:31Z,VERIFIED! works perfect! thanks Bart91 :D
,Deanbt,2007-01-17T11:32Z,"Would someone go through the installation process, and is this compatible with windows XP?"
,the boy,2007-01-17T13:55Z,Seed please
,shadowiko,2007-01-17T16:56Z,"ppl can anyone plz tell me why is my downloading stopped at 65.6%? It says: ""connecting to tracker to say start, waiting for response""?
Status:Connecting

,SSJNiKe,2007-01-17T17:59Z,"So...if I dl this...do I need to input a code on the site to be able to access the BC stuff in game?

I'm from England so i'm not sure if I should just order it, lol."
,hapshay2,2007-01-18T04:45Z,"1. used daemon tool to mount the 2 gig file 
2. after mounting the file, ran installation and was able to complete installation w/o any problem
3. logged in to the game, auto patch reverted back to 2.0.0 then auto repatched back to 2.0.5
4. this is file is good! it has my seal of approval , and oh yea this is really an enUS file
a million thanks again to the original uploader and to all the ppl who seeded it"
,HappyMojo,2007-01-18T11:36Z,"this is for the US version of wow only. if your from britain, try one of the enGB torrents."
,SSJNiKe,2007-01-18T15:14Z,"I play the US version, thats why I was wondering if you need to input the code on the site to access BC stuff after installing this."
,Deanbt,2007-01-18T17:50Z,"Alright, so i mount Burning Crusade Disc 1? got that far ... now my problem is none of the installation files are openable ... do i need a program? "
,thibault123,2007-01-18T23:06Z,"Ok, I've downloaded the 4 part set and this one. The 4 parter was corrupted and this one wont run for me with either daemon tools or without. Says 'Sorry, the installer was unable to start up. You may be out of hard drive space'.

Anysuggestions? I have several hundred gig free on the drive."
,kbasanti,2007-01-19T05:11Z,"PLEASE SEED im stuck at 81 %, i will seed after it is done downloading...PLEASE"
,ukoa,2007-01-19T14:42Z,"This this is pretty pointless.
you can install it but you cant play unless you upgrade your account, which requires a key.

You still have to go buy it to get a key."
,Rootger,2007-01-21T04:24Z,"Lol, seed pls...
i just bought my key and cant play until have it installed.."
,the_bear1234,2007-01-23T00:09Z,Hey does this work? if so how do i get onto a private server plz email me at ebear567@hotmail.com or pm me 
,dbznss,2007-01-23T17:11Z,"
This also has my approval! I had already purchased a CD key online and they had givin me a link to a torrent, althought that didn't work and neither did any of the other 3 i downloaded. This downloaded in Just a couple hours, I mounted it, Installed it, auto reverted back to 2.0.3 then back to 2.0.5 then to 2.0.6. and it worked! Thanks a bunch!"
,dbznss,2007-01-23T17:44Z,This is not how you get a private server working ppl. This is for the real thing.
,coolbiker,2007-01-26T01:58Z,well quick note that as far as I see this does not include the mac side of game  as far as i can see. would have been nice just to have both like the dvd actually probably has.
