The companion CDROM for the book Game Programming Gems 6 (ISBN 1584504501)
 
http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1584504501

Note: It's the CDROM only, not an OCR of the book itself. Even so, I thought some might find it interesting.

I've stripped out most of the redistributable stuff (DirectX, GLUT, GLEW)
