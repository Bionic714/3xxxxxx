I am really struggling to learn programming
and want to learn it in a fun way.  I look forward 
to playing it soon. Thank you."
,szamoca69,2007-03-31T01:08Z,With pleasure... this was my first torrent and it was fun...
,isti123,2007-04-18T16:21Z,Can anybody tell me how to install this game?
,knapret,2007-06-09T13:38Z,"the install.exe didn't work for me, but it's not needed.

un-ace the files with winace or winrar, then run the colobot.reg and start the game (colobot.exe).

Good game, especially the programming parts. The game makes it easy to learn a bit of programming. The graphics and action parts of the game are bad by today's standards. It's an old game and not worth the 49? it costs to order online! Consider trying CeeBot, it's supposedly like this game but with only the programming exercises (and more of them)."
,mashed,2007-12-24T23:00Z,A rare upload indeed. Thank you for this. I'll make sure to seed as time allows.
,szamoca69,2008-01-03T00:59Z,"Ohh mannn, so fucking coool, people still care.... so happy to download one of mym own"
,knapret,2008-01-09T23:50Z,"I see you uploaded this almost exactly a year ago now! This is a timeless little gem. It's not perfect, but it's one of a kind. Great upload! :)

I'm still seeding it sometimes just to make sure it's alive and I think others are too. If it's ever on 0 seeds it's only temporary."
,Jonofwrath,2008-03-11T15:04Z,"Played a demo of this years ago - it's genius! 

Also! If you like this look out for a game called MindRover!!! 

Thanks for Seeding, will def keep this gem on the seed list :D"

,demmydemon,2008-10-19T14:37Z,"This game is awesome.
I wish there was a game like this, but with more of an adult feel.  An RTS with programmable units, for example.
I've been unable to find such a game, save for Spring, which lets you do pretty much anything in Lua:

Still, I love the simplistic in-game language in Colobot, and Spring is all external-editor Lua, so it's not at all the same."
,alkorb,2008-10-28T14:00Z,"A classic B side. Great game, great upload. Congratulations!!!"
