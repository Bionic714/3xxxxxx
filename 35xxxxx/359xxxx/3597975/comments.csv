,Necman,2007-01-18T14:29Z,"Somethings wrong, this is supposed to be episode 17. The error was made when episode 14 was named 15.

The storyline would be wrong if this is episode 14, as dr. Becket dies here, but appears in at least the one named episode 15.

There it says that this is e17."
,Azgarde,2007-01-18T16:03Z,"Episode 12 is really episode 10. They needed a two part series for the mid season final. So this episode (18) is actually 17. If you dont believe me, theen watch 12 again. I think it is Rodney that says that the stargate bridge is not yet finished.   Hope this clears up the controversy. Now you can all go and renumber your episodes.
Peace."
