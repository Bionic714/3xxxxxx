I dont know if you guys are just plain stupid or what... But as you see, The Ark should be episode 16. Aswell as episode 17 shall be sunday.

And also, my source:
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0374455/episodes#season-3

And when im on this route anyway, well, I would chose imdb.com before any other movie-fact-site."
,BlackBolt,2007-01-17T23:18Z,"No atorn; well maybe yes, some people might be stupid, but others just got confused over episode 14 airing later than expected..."

,Heimdall01,2007-03-09T13:04Z,This is 316 The Ark. This was supposed to be the 317 (Sunday)..sigh!!   
,mi_trooper,2007-06-25T17:39Z,"This is not episode 17 ""Sunday"" but episode 16 ""The Ark""!"
,Fellup,2007-12-10T08:35Z,They did not release the e14 :S Dunno why actually...
,sg7346435,2007-12-10T18:00Z,How about actually NAMING AND numbering the episodes while you put them up on piratebay instead of just numbering them. This could protect from confusion.
