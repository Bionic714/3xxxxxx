,niaxilin,2007-01-16T14:26Z,"I just finished the WoW_BC_ByDuxa.part1.exe torrent. Right-clicking ""Open with WinRAR"" on the file confirms it is a valid WinRAR self-extracting, and the Title is set to ""Titan Quest By Duxa"" (oops). To be safe, I still used my own WinRAR to extract it, which eventually stopped to ask for Part 2. Will post again once I have all the parts."
