,fmustang76,2007-01-12T02:45Z,"Intel Play and Digital Blue came out with a camera called a ""Digital Movie Creator"" (Intel originally made the camera and now it is only made by Digital Blue). This is an ISO image of the Manufacturers Cd which includes the most recent drivers and Video editing software. Cd will work for both the Intel and Digital Blue ""Digital Movie Creator"" camera."
