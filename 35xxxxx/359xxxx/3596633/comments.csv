Please SEED!!!"
,C-Man,2007-01-16T17:45Z,"Quite ok movie, in dvd quality anyway."
,Crowley78,2007-01-17T01:25Z,"Wrong category.... This is the DVDR section, meaning the movies here are ment to be burned on a DVD (DVD-5 or DVD-9). Avi-files, or any other compressed format, should never be called dvd-rip, because ripping a DVD does not result in a smaller, compressed version of the original...."

WRONG!! when you Rip something it means that you compress it too a much smaller file... when you Rip a Audio CD you compress the audio down too MP3 files remember?? do a mp3 album take 700MiB diskspace?? no it dosent!! A *.avi file made from a DVD is a DVDrip... but you can't compare a DVD""rip"" whit a DVD""R"" becouse a DVDR is an uncompressed butt scaled original DVD..."
,Xoffis,2007-01-22T10:11Z,"Butt i Agree, this movie lies in the wrong category..."
,DrBosa,2007-02-08T18:24Z,DVDR and DVD-rip are two completely different things you morons.
,headros,2007-02-11T23:48Z,"Arr i DL this thinking tis a DVDR, but some twat compressed it.  You better walk the plank. Arrr"
