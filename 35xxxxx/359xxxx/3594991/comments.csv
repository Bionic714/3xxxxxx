!!!NOTE 
Since 01/01/2008 this application might not install anymore and exit with 'Expired Certificate' warning. I was able to resolve this by warping my phone date back to 01/01/2007, install the application and then put the date back to today (somewhere in 2008)

,Himalde,2008-03-15T17:06Z,"A short summery:

This works fine with Most NOKIA phones (N95, N82 etc), BUT.

This works only with EXTERNAL bluetooth gps, it does NOT work with internal gps. ALL TOMTOM applications are like this.

To get it working you must do the following:

1. Copy the map folders in the root of the memory card.

2. Change the year in the phones clock to 2007.

3. Install as described in the txt-file."
