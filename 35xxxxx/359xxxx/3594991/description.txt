TomTom Mobile v6.010 [Cracked by BiNPDA] (21/10/2006)
-----------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------
Instructions for Mobile phone installation :

1). Copy all contents of folder "Memory Card Files" to the root folder of your Mobile phone
    using simple data transfer mode (USB connection). Do NOT use PC Suite or other NOKIAS' software.

2). Disconnect Mobile phone from PC using Safely Remove Hardware (right down icon on your WINDOWS XP bar)
    and use File Manager of your MObile to run "TomTom.Mobile.v6.01.S60v3.SymbianOS9.1.Cracked.by.BiNPDA.sis" 
    directly from your Memory Card. After TOMTOM installation, you may remove this file from the root of your
    Memory Card.

3). You are now ready to run TOMTOM 6 although there is no MAP installed yet. For this reason several MAPs
    are included in this archive : 
    a)."v660.1212_Central_Europe_&_Major_Roads_of_Western_Europe" = Latest (2007) Central Europe plus Major roads of Western Europe	
    b)."v660.1256_Western_Europe" = Latest (2007) Western Europe Maps (only)
    c). "Western_&_Central_Europe_(Includes_Greece)" (Located in folder "MAPS for TOMTOM 6") = Both two above Maps together but in 
        an older version which includes also major roads of Greece and the most roads of Athens. This Map is recommended if 
        you're planning traveling to Greece from Europe only.
    d). Many more maps which are located in "MAPS for TOMTOM 6" folder :
        + Canary_Islands
	+ France_Plus_Major_Roards_of_Western_Europe
	+ Germany-Austria_&_Czech_Republic_Plus_Major_Roads_of_Western_Europe
	+ Great_Britain_Plus_Major_Roads_of_Western_Europe
	+ Italy_Plus_Major_Roads_of_Western_Europe
	+ Spain_&_Portugal_Plus_Major_Roads_of_Western_Europe
	+ Sweden-Denmark-Norway_&_Finland_Plus_Major_Roads_of_Western_Europe
	+ United_States_(Canada_&_Alaska)
	+ United_States_(North_America)
	+ United_States_(SouthEast_Region)
	+ Western_&_Central_Europe_(Includes_Greece)

    Consider your Memory Card capacity and you may copy those folders into the root folder of it. 

Although this version is CRACKED which means there is no need to activate the Maps in order to use them, if you're planning
to use TOMTOM HOME which keeps your TOMTOM up to date to the latest version, there is a chance in future updates to lose the ability
of free "copy - paste - use" Map folders. In such case, use "TT6_KG.exe" DOS utility supplied in this archive which is a KeyGenerator 
for the Maps. You may use this tool for generating keys for every Map designed for TOMTOM 6 also for other OS such as Windows Mobile 
(PDAs), etc. Just locate the *.mid file in every Map folder, and in a DOS prompt type "TT6_KG.exe <name_of_Map>.mid". 
Type the code provided from your device and then enter back the code from your generator.

Enjoy !!
