Original hack on Xbox was fun :-0"
,wozzo99,2007-01-20T19:30Z,The 360 hacks at the moment are all centered around modding the firmware of the dvd drive to boot backups and rip games in windows and it does work!
,Tuzzen,2007-01-31T23:17Z,"Tanka 360 emulator på minova

Några fråger så skriv privat."
,galbatron,2007-02-02T15:03Z,Yeah Right! Tuzzen   STOP spreading false Info! To emulate te 360 you need a Big fucking computer.. hehe
,Tuzzen,2007-02-03T20:53Z,"To galbatron 

Hmm the thing is that you instal the program and the xbox think it's a xbox game for that machine...

Man instalerar programet så tror xboxen att det är ett spel för den consollen så det fungerar hur bra som hällst"
,ghampus,2007-02-22T17:09Z,"Jo, och Xbox har ju samma kapacitet som 360 har också...."
,drummerdude,2007-03-12T00:52Z,Is there a modchip for the 360 that anybody uses? if so could you tell me were to find it.
,galbatron,2007-03-27T01:49Z,You have  Globe360 Modchip or NME Modchip. they allow for dual firmwares. but xbox live still works with the hacked firmware so no need for modchip! dvd Firmware mod is still the best alternative!
,iceman3099,2007-04-17T17:25Z,600-800 kps...thanks seeders!!!
,galbatron,2007-06-10T19:51Z,Remember not to use LIVE unless you have Samsung drive with iXtreme 1.2!!  consoles with lower firmware will be banned from live!!!

,BHollander,2008-11-30T01:39Z,Will this help me when: renting video games and installing it to the hard drive and then making a copy of it to pass the test and not spinning.
,tripper511,2008-12-10T12:42Z,"Just because it's legal to back up your games doesn't mean anything.  Xbox live is privately owned by Microsoft and you digitally sign a contract when you buy it.  They can do what ever they want when it comes to allowing access to it.  That's why they only ban you and don't sue you.

There's some pudding to stick your proof in."
,TDG,2009-01-10T00:02Z,"Guys....

BACK UPS ARE LEGAL ANYWHERE!!!!!!!!!!!!!

You can legally back up Cds, Dvds and Games THAT YOU OWN.....

What is ILLEGAL is distributing them and selling them for money...
Also Xbox, Live, Microsoft doesn't allow and bans because they assume you just bought or downloaded it, and they don't make $60 a pop... "
,zOmBiEfReAkEr,2009-04-11T20:48Z,Thanks a bunch galbatron
,futbolgrg,2009-06-12T23:40Z,"Thank you, and its extremely fast!!! Hope this helps me."
,tyrelleze,2009-07-24T03:20Z,THIS BROKE MY XBOX
,kolewan,2009-10-19T08:29Z,lol @ Tyrelleze... Just saying THIS BROKE MY XBOX won't cut it. What happened to make it brake? did you improperly open it? Install old firmware? perhaps didn't have the correct SATA chipset... You don't just BRAKE it. Foolish people.
