Responsible for the production of Vengeance Essential Club Sounds Vol. 1 are Manuel Schleis & Manuel Reuter, two of the most respected guys in the german dance industry. If you are producing dance music you most likely used sounds made by Manuel Schleis already, as he programmed sounds and factory presets exclusively for established brands such as Access, Roland, Waldorf & ReFX. Beside that he is holding his own platform Vengeance Sound, making even more soundsets online available, as well as being an active producer in the dance industry, same as his partner Manuel Reuter, who is behind projects such as DJ Manian, Yanou, Cascada, Plazmatek just to mention a very few. Apart from that they have also been engaged to deliver remix works for established chart acts like 4 Strings, Pulsedriver, Dumonde etc..., so thereÂ´s no doubt that this sampling cd is done by well experienced producers who definitely know how dance music should sound like!
