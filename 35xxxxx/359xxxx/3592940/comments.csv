,neural2,2007-01-09T17:33Z,"Thanx,

Pitty though with all rar-files. Just a waste of time and space."
,Branstrom,2007-01-09T17:40Z,Abolish RAR once and for all! Enemy of all man kind!
,Lestat.ss,2007-01-09T18:13Z,SEED!!!! Please =D I'll seed till ration 5:1

,runner777,2007-01-09T18:26Z,"Common folks, let someone resample this to standard format of 350MB without rar.."
,tick,2007-01-09T21:07Z,"Stop complaining about the rar files,
The ppl that relese the tv / movie and so on uses ftoÂ´s and if there is one file that getts corrupt its no problem with rar files.. just to change that one, and when you ppl download it here you can check and se if it is a REAL release or if it is just a idiot that fakes and putts up bad thing.. 

So thanx TiAMO for this great Tv-Ep..

Love it!"
,kughove,2007-01-09T22:19Z,thx for the uppload. :) 
,randyored3,2007-01-10T01:24Z,"Hey all. I'm the recoder Elfin. 

I just got home. As soon as I get it downloaded, I will recode it to 350mb. 

Have patience."
,brownrl,2007-01-10T01:32Z,"I think its huge because of the ac3 and hdtv yada yada. cool that they got it out. Pitty that it was done is a newb way. 1 whole entire cd+ for one single episode. Ya that's going to catch on.

As for RAR files they rule! If you knew anything about how underground groups check and verify and such then you would know why the rar files exists and praise them. OR if you really want to know make an ISO of something and try uploading it as one 700mb file to a server somewhere, around the 3 or 4th attempt and 2gb+ wasted bandwidth later you will figure it out."
,nemurytorul,2007-01-10T02:33Z,tx man for this
,Alca Isilon,2007-01-11T21:12Z,"@brownrl: true, RAR is useful there
On the bittorrent network however it really breaks usability of certain features (selecting only the files you want for download) and corruption checking and fixing is provided by BitTorrent also (in a more efficient way) so that wouldn't be an argument to stick with RAR when seeding it from a RARed source.

The only real (entirely valid) argument for using RARs on bittorrent is plain lazyness to extract it."
,Chandon,2007-01-16T16:25Z,"Stop complaining about decent quality releases and RARs. Seriously. 700 meg HR HDTV releases will become *more* common, not less, and that's a good thing."
,m0deth,2007-01-20T05:22Z,"brownrl - The size does not mean newb, it means they kept the quality as high as possible, or why bother getting it from HD content to begin with? 

Half quality versions will filter down, chill, I have tons of 716mb+- files, and frankly, in 32"" wide, they just look better than your ""standard"" haha"
,Ykalon,2007-04-11T23:26Z,This is NOT episode 17 it is episode 16. Does anyone have the REAL episode 17 please?
