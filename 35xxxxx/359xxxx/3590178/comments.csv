,sugarchic37,2007-01-06T15:24Z,hey this might sound like im reall dumb but when i click to downloadstuff off this site it says 'file type unknown click to find or save' but whenever i click either one nothing about this site comes up and i dont know what sort of file this is so if anyone knows how i can just get my computer to just download these files please tell me!!! thaanks
,fgherger,2007-01-06T16:16Z,"You are right, you are really dumb. That´s probably the dumbiest question you can make in a Bit torrent tracker site, 'cos it makes obvious that you don´t know you need a bit-torrent client do download stuff. Please make a minimum reseach on the subject before asking, so you won't look dumb again."
,Xlil_Mik3staX,2007-01-06T20:51Z,"hey does anyone know if there is the ""property of ....."" message in this dvdscr? i cant seem to find it anywhere although i havent seen the whole movie yet
