              RELEASE:  Internal Affairs        

              Nick is murdered in his condo and Natalia is arrested 
              for the crime when evidence at the scene suggests she 
              killed him, but Horatio tries to clear her name. The 
              evidence also reveals that Delko and Nick fought 
              earlier in the day. In another case, a wealthy single 
              man is found dead in his mansion with a granite-topped
              bookshelf on top of him. The investigation reveals the
              victim was seeing a therapist who suddenly dropped him 
              as a patient.
