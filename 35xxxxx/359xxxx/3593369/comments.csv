,nightmoods,2007-01-18T00:43Z,"ok just trying to help - try using ULTRA ISO
it should be ok 
Its a very good route too - 
Hope you all get it up and running , good luck"
,skaliwag66,2007-01-26T22:30Z,"OK

-I TRIED MOUNTING THE IMAGE WITH POWER ISO AND SETUP.EXE ALWAYS CRASHED.
-THEN I EXTRACTED THE CONTENTS OF THE .ISO FILE AND TRIED TO RUN SETUP AND RECIEVE THE SAME 'NOT A VALID WIN32 APPLICATION' ERROR.
-I THEN TRIED ULTRA ISO AND IT MOUNTED THE IMAGE FINE 

-BUT-

WHEN I RAN THE SETUP.EXE A SMALL LITTLE BAR APPEARS AND DOESN'T GO AWAY UNLESS I KILL ITS PROCESS WITH TASK MANAGER.

CAN YOU PLEASE TELL ME HOW ON EARTH CAN WE INSTALL THIS THING. 

AND THIS ROUTE BETTER BE WORTH ALL THE TROUBLE!"
,maracka,2007-02-02T02:58Z,"I agree with sgnauz, Berlin Subway would be great. Does anyone have it?"
,roggek,2007-02-09T14:24Z,The EXE file is a virus. DO NOT DOWNLOAD. Avoid all uploads from PILOT121
,pilot121,2007-02-24T18:48Z,roggek WHAT DA FUCK R U ON M8 UR THE FUCKING ONE WHO SAYS SHIT ABOUT PEOPLE CUZ YOU PROBS WORK FOR A COMPANY WHO STUFF IS UPLOADED HERE WELL I CAN TELL U SOMETHING GO FUCK YOUR MA SHE IS WAITING FOR YOU 
,nightmoods,2007-03-01T00:53Z,ok i used ultraISO Premium edition - opened it with that and as it was ok i used it to burn to disk - then istalled from the disk - worked fine - yes this is worth installing - i have 4 small routes on my site for uploading if anyone wants it let me know - you know email addy or something so i can give you the link kk - anyway this isnt a virus - take no notice of that plonker - just use ultraiso to burn to disk - easy - have fun
,skaliwag66,2007-03-02T02:03Z,CAN SOMEONE WHO MANAGED TO GET THIS ROUTE WORKING REPACKAGE IT AND RE-UPLOAD IT. MAKES NO SENSE THAT HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE ARE DOWNLOADING A 600MB CORRUPT FILE.
,roggek,2007-03-08T17:53Z,"""roggek WHAT DA FUCK R U ON M8 UR THE FUCKING ONE WHO SAYS SHIT ABOUT PEOPLE CUZ YOU PROBS WORK FOR A COMPANY WHO STUFF IS UPLOADED HERE WELL I CAN TELL U SOMETHING GO FUCK YOUR MA SHE IS WAITING FOR YOU"" 

Apparently yuo don't know how to make a torrent for this MSTS addon to work properly, therefore i still say that the its probably a virus...

So PILOT121:
GO FUCK YOURSELF UNTIL YOU HAVE FIGURED OUT TO MAKE THIS ISO WORKING!"
,nightmoods,2007-03-31T13:43Z,"For those of you who cant get this to work - your obviously dumb - its not hard to install addons - i bet you aint even run the install bat file.
come off it - its great to see someone actually posting addons - i dont see you doing it - so dont complain.
thanks pilot121 for everything......."
,pilot121,2007-04-01T19:16Z,ok people listen up i have just got alot more MSTS add ons including London and South coast me and Nightmoods are gonna start our own website for MSTS torrents which should be up by Saturday the 7th of April 2007 if there is any of you that has MSTS add ons but don't want to seed them or anything please email me and i will help you out thanks (email: pilot121@hotmail.co.uk)
,CaPolarBear,2007-05-14T11:05Z,"For people looking for addons, torrents seem to be somewhat lacking. I strongly suggest trying emule, I have found a number of packages there I could not get here or on any other torrent site."
,hgb_mike,2007-06-08T08:35Z,"I get an error wen i try to run this ??? 

If I extract this file to a folder and run setup.exe i get setup.exe is not a valid Win32 App error. 
have tried using this ultraiso and it does nothing just opens a box that wont go away any more ideas on this as i really would love install and start playing.
I've been trying and trying and trying i even redownloaded it 5 times but still not working.
any way to make the setup.exe work. Or else pls remove the iso file.

 many thanks

,FatFreddy465,2011-05-04T17:42Z,"I have the same problem, setup just crashes before it loads..

Pilot121, can't you at least support the torrents you upload, instead of telling people to get stuffed."
