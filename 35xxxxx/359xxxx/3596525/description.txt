If youve heard and loved their stuff on GH1 and GH2, then youll love this album. So far, its been one of the better punk/alternative CDs Ive heard in a while. Arterial Black and Decontrol stand out as the more prominant ones, but its still a fantastic album overall. Feel free to redistribute this to whatever you feel like. I want this torrent spread.

Download information : I got this from signing up for a free trial over at eMusic. They let me download Drist's first album too, which was done in 2004, vs this one in 2006. I havent listened to it yet, but Im sure its great. I dont know the exact format they used, but the files all sound great. No cuts, no scratches, great solid MP3's. Good size too for the quality. Since I dont actually OWN the CD, I just have to accept their rip. Enjoy!!

Ill seed for a few weeks or til I hit 20:1 ratio. Do the world a favor and do the same!!
