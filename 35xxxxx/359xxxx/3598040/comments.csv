,pastasauce,2008-06-20T10:34Z,I'm re-seeding this (I found the file).  This is a 128kbps rip.  I don't know why I ripped it at that.  I'll re-upload it if I ever find the CD.  I think it feel behind my dresser or it's under my bed.  I'll look for it when I find sufficient ammunition to defend myself with.
