,Juster45,2007-01-18T17:31Z,wow thats really compressed...
,webrosc,2007-01-18T17:43Z,"thats what i thought, maybe its a new form of win rar that only the FBI have, or could it possible be a virus?
has anyone checked?"
,Bamio,2007-01-18T18:01Z,"LOOOOOL

,sence,2007-01-18T18:33Z,"HAHAHAH omg, and the funny thing is that someone Dl it"

,Panodilo,2007-01-19T00:06Z,LMAO
,webrosc,2007-01-19T02:11Z,"ok i'm amazed, downloaded to see what viruses it was, but there is a cd iso in the rar file :S"
,webrosc,2007-01-19T02:12Z,not gonna install it tho as i still don't trust it lol
,BBu,2007-01-19T14:28Z,"To clear things up:
It really contains a 700mb ISO.

BUT: it's a maxi-iso.

It contains no real data, only a few bytes needed to trick the game into thinking the real cd is in the drive.

!!! Football Manager 2007 Maxi-Image !!!

NOT the real game.

If you don't know what this means: use Google!"
,*SvenskaNedladdaren*,2007-01-21T16:08Z,Maxi ISO ! Its not BS ! Thanks !
,elite|ralle,2007-01-24T14:43Z,"hi, somepeople said it worked, some thought it would be viruses... well... I wont take the risk"
,JakSmit,2007-01-26T18:04Z,"ok, this is sort of correct. it's like a nocd patch. it's not the fullgame in that it doesnt work by itself, you need to have installed footmall manager 2007 first"
,seref87,2007-02-19T15:17Z,seed please
,Ahujj,2007-05-24T18:35Z,"All of you people who think this is crap, just try it.

I thought it was rubbish, but it works perfectly."
,Ahujj,2007-05-24T18:35Z,"Also, how do you do it?"
,fisk3n,2007-09-14T11:11Z,It's not BullSHit it's true I downloaded it to see what kind of Virus it was but it was the FULL game:O (Poseden has made that so but i don't know how)
