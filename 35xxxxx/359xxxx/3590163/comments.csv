,Cain303,2007-01-06T14:05Z,Thanks. But what's with the duplicate tracks?
,octo1,2007-01-15T04:42Z,"thanks for sharing, but this is almost impossible to listen to. id3 tags are a mess, repeated tracks, no track numbers. itunes, real player and windows media pleyer will not make much sense out of it.

only if you really really want it...."
