,bollinger109193,2007-06-17T23:43Z,"Hi everybody. Several people reported malfunctioning of mousebuttons when they play Trophy Bass Fishing Hole 2007. We figured out this problem occurs with people that have a non-English Operating System. The game was intended for sale in North America only.

Anyway, there is an easy way to fix this:

    * Open ""autoexec.cfg"" which is located in the TB2007 install folder.  By default this is C:/program files/Trophy Bass 2007/WORK/bin. 
    * replace rangebind ""##mouse"" ""Button 0"" 0.000000 0.000000 ""Shoot"" with rangebind ""##mouse"" ""##Button 0"" 0.000000 0.000000 ""Shoot""
    * replace rangebind ""##mouse"" ""Button 1"" 0.000000 0.000000 ""QuickReel"" with rangebind ""##mouse"" ""##Button 1"" 0.000000 0.000000 ""QuickReel"" "
,bollinger109193,2007-06-18T00:31Z,Får inte inte tangentbordet att fungera så ställer ni om språkinställningarna till engelska så skall det fungera perfekt.
,ryssken,2007-07-18T21:39Z,can somebody explan better so i can understand there is no button1 just z-axis:S plssssssssssss beskriv på svenska tack!!!!
,marjacques,2007-08-08T20:34Z,"thanks to bollinger109193 for the code. 

in my autoexec.cfg didn´t exist a line like ""rangebind ""##mouse"" ""Button 0"" 0.000000 0.000000 ""Shoot"". 
there eas only codes like this: 
""rangebind ""##mouse"" ""##z-axis"" 0.000000 0.000000 ""Axis3"" 
scale ""##mouse"" ""##z-axis"" 0.040000

so the only thing to do is ad these two lines (leaving the other lines as they are) after
- enabledevice ""##mouse"":
rangebind ""##mouse"" ""##Button 1"" 0.000000 0.000000 ""QuickReel"" 
rangebind ""##mouse"" ""##Button 0"" 0.000000 0.000000 ""Shoot"" 

i´m using my mouse ok now. i hope it help somebody"

,Szed,2008-02-08T20:04Z,"thanks bollinger109193 and marjacques, but sorry .. I dont really understand you :S
first, you said: open autoexec.cfg, what program do I have to open it with?

the other thing you wrote about might be a little easier to understand when I have past this problem.. I guess

thank you ;)"
,roeseph24,2008-08-07T07:12Z,"the initial load works fine, then i get some init. rendering error and the game crashes.  ive re-installed it twice now...any help?"
,jon1687,2008-08-15T00:40Z,"When I load the game it goes through the opening scenes and then aborts to my desktop with the caption...""Error in InitRenderer(). Shutting Down.
Has this happened to anyone else?  Is there a way to fix this? "

I have the same problem"
,minime1977,2009-08-26T19:12Z,"THE PROPER FIX FOR THE MOUSE BUG (at least for swedish operating systems):

Open ""autoexec.cfg"" which is located in the TB2007 install folder. By default this is C:/program/Trophy Bass 2007/WORK/bin. Under the line "" enabledevice ""##mouse"" "" input:

rangebind ""##mouse"" ""##Button 0"" 0.000000 0.000000 ""Shoot""
rangebind ""##mouse"" ""##Button 1"" 0.000000 0.000000 ""QuickReel""

This will make the file look like this at the end of the textfile:
enabledevice ""##mouse""
rangebind ""##mouse"" ""##Button 0"" 0.000000 0.000000 ""Shoot""
rangebind ""##mouse"" ""##Button 1"" 0.000000 0.000000 ""QuickReel""
rangebind ""##mouse"" ""##z-axis"" 0.000000 0.000000 ""Axis3"" 
scale ""##mouse"" ""##z-axis"" 0.040000
rangebind ""##mouse"" ""##y-axis"" 0.000000 0.000000 ""Axis2"" 
scale ""##mouse"" ""##y-axis"" 0.004625
rangebind ""##mouse"" ""##x-axis"" 0.000000 0.000000 ""Axis1"" 
scale ""##mouse"" ""##x-axis"" 0.004625
ModelAdd 0.000000 0.000000 0.000000"
