What's the compression of the movie? The original movie is pretty long so I guess the compression is maybe 50%...?"

compression dont know, and dont care

ive used dvdshrink, and i know its not HD or Blueray quality."
,Patton2,2007-01-11T20:00Z,"Well, thank you for your...good answers....
When you use dvd shrink use can easily choose the compression depending on what you want to include in the copy...
Of course it will never be BR or HDDVD quality thats not what I hoped for either...
Sorry, I was only asking..."
,Foxxen,2007-01-12T15:18Z,"If the compression is 50% the videoquality is great if you look at it with a screen as not bigger than 7"". Looking at it on a normal size TV like 32"" it really is going to suck. Nobody expects HD DVD quality, but at least decent DVD quality. Instead of uploading it too compressed, why not uploading it uncompressed?
Thanx anyway!"
,mugge67,2007-01-13T06:47Z,"its compressed by 54.4%

im sorry 4 sharing this complete worthless pease of shit "
,vickyk73,2007-01-13T20:33Z,Hi. Thanks for sharing this awesome dvd. Just one question is it a dvd with all the f1 races of 2006?
,Foxxen,2007-01-15T09:16Z,Sorry man... didn't know you could'nt take some critics. I was just saying what I was thinking. And as I said: Thanx anyway!
,Mr.Mister,2007-01-27T01:09Z,"Yea, thanx for a great upload but the quality is really bad..........sorry. "
,annorlunda45,2007-10-02T22:13Z,"Have not seen this yet but a compression from 6.7G to 4.4G is not much to complain about, thanks for this."
