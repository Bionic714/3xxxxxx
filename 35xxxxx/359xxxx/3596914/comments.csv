,Maggi10,2007-01-16T16:27Z,does this file work or is it fake?... does it work for me ?(from norway)
,Mr.bZerk,2007-01-16T17:11Z,You need a cd-key to play Burning Crusade. What the point to download.
,Dem123,2007-01-16T19:11Z,"Cause some of us don't have the installation keys, however just the cd key. There's also private servers and all that jazz."
,Gobbol,2007-01-16T21:53Z,"you can still install it if you dont have the key, just neeed to clieck the word called ""Skip"""
,Gobbol,2007-01-16T22:07Z,"hydrocodone, 
I could care less if you do or dont donwload it, i made the ISO myself from the 4 CD's i got and i tested it on 2 PC.... "
,Tormentedhalo,2007-01-17T00:21Z,if we dont have a cd key can we still play on blizzard servers cuz i dont :[
,Dem123,2007-01-17T01:52Z,No you cannot play on the official servers without a valid account. To play TBC you need to upgrade your account with a key for it.
,shuxer2,2007-01-17T10:29Z,"Gobbol thanks for uploading a working  copy of the retail tbc (enUS) =)

,sir_rally,2007-01-17T13:50Z,"need help with this game or any other torrent? mayb e i can help u! just add me to your msn!

My msn is sir_rally@hotmail.com"
,Moorhun,2007-01-18T15:33Z,U CANT PLAY ON THE INTERNET!! shit... stupid fucks;)
,TazzieT07,2007-01-23T16:57Z,"Oh it might Download, Correctly, BUT ya need the Following..

1. Retail Copy of WoW
2. ACTIVE WoW Account
and Lastly, You need a CD-Key that is located on the jacket of the FIRST CD. You cannot give it out to your friends cause each key is issued to ONE account.
There is no way to ""crack"" a CD Key, that is issued per account. So everyone just save your pennies, your yen, your shillings, your pounds and just go BUY the Expansion. Cause instead of wasting your time tryin to install a copy that won't FULLY install because it needs a cd-key to be asigned to your account, just go buy it.
Now if ya choose not to listen then by all means download waste your time and try using an already used code..and sit back and watch how fast your account gets ""locked/Banned"""

,Azpire,2007-02-08T16:58Z,"Den här kopian av WoW TBC funkar endast om du har det första wow installerat på datorn. Det wow som redan är installerat måste vara en ""enUS version"" för att allt ska fungera. Du kan inte spela på blizzards servrar men det finns privat servrar som går att ansluta till.  Något annat ni vill veta?"
,Azpire,2007-02-11T23:17Z,"Zombiface, jag får samma error som dig. Jag kommer in på servern och har skapat en gubbe. När jag ska gå in i världen så kommer det upp: Wow error bla bla..  Är det fel Patch jag använder??"
