,wxppf,2007-01-14T02:17Z,is this compatible wit tt5 mobile
,ryanbrancel,2007-01-14T05:24Z,"This torrent includes:
North America  1.4 GB
USA and Canada 900 MB (in case you need to fit on a 1 SB SD card)

This will work for:
GO series, ONE, RIDER, NAVIGATOR 6

The original update DVD is 7.85 GB, however the only useful updates are the North American maps, so I made a custom DVD that includes just those features."
,ma678,2007-01-14T15:50Z,"Hope it will work well.
Thanks a lot."
,big20,2007-01-15T07:07Z,"Thanks ryanbrancel 
Is the 900MB map also v6.55 ?
Is there a Canada/Alaska  map  v6.55?"
,ma678,2007-01-15T22:11Z,Seeds. Plz.
,ma678,2007-01-16T05:39Z,"Any one can tell me how to install those maps?

Thanks."
,mooojalla,2007-01-17T17:35Z,I think you need to use TomTom Home to install the map
,illuminater,2007-01-18T06:40Z,"If you have the CD autoplay, or run ""install TomTome home.exe"" it will install TomTom Home on your computer.

I had already installed the TT6 application from another torrent, so after putting my SD card in the card reader, the TomTom home program (once installed) recognized the SD card as a TomTom device. It then gives you the option to install either the North American or USA & Canada maps. Select one of those 2 choices to install. It will take about 5 minutes to uncompress and install on your SD card.

Once it is installed on your card, I copied the USA and Canada folder back to my hard drive, and followed previous instructions from another torrent about using the keygen and a guam map. "

,moochman,2007-02-13T22:46Z,The North America Map is corrupt but the USA and Canada map is OK
,ryanbrancel,2007-02-19T03:29Z,"If you get an error, try the upgrade process again.  Also reference the instructions from TomTom in my prior post.  It will work the second time through."

,paypal,2007-03-21T20:13Z,"Couldnt get the keygen to work for usa and canada... (TomTom N6, Windows mobile 5 on a HTC-phone)"
,ianwilly,2007-03-23T23:36Z,"read the third post this only works on TomTom Devices 

GO series, ONE, RIDER, NAVIGATOR 6

so if you try it on a phone or ppc etc it WILL NOT WORK.

some people just download without reading all the posts all your answers are there.

oh thanks for the maps, now I just got to cross the Pond (Atlantic) to use them LOL"
,ikey82,2007-04-13T17:05Z,"Please, wich is the difference between North America and USA&Canada maps? The first has USA&Canada and all other countries?
Tks"
,Gradger,2007-04-29T17:12Z,I am new to the Tom Tom. i want to download the software onto a SD card for when I go florida. Can anyone give me an idiots guide. Also I tried the keygen in this download and it does not work.

,Dortje,2007-05-24T00:16Z,"Where can I find the MID file? I need this to activate the keygen. Can anyone please help me?
Thanks!"
,lmslms,2007-06-02T04:25Z,"What I did is that 
1) I made a DVD (bootable) using this torrent.
2) Connected my TomTom to my computer, and inserted the DVD to DVD rom. TomTom Home was started.
3) In the Home window, I had tow choices to install the maps: North_America and US and Canada. Installed one of them to my TomTom hard drive (when ask code, kip).
4) In my TomTom hard drive, I saw the map folder. In that folder, I got the MID file, and then used keygen to get a activation code.
5) Finally, I activated in TomTom."
,fog80,2007-07-08T18:32Z,"Worked perfectly! The key is to burn it to a dvd and then use that with TomTom Home to install the N.America maps.

When it asks you for an activation code, just press the skip button and let the maps install on your tomtom. When you reboot your tomtom you will get your device code, which you will use in conjunction with the .mid file to get your activation code.

Saved me a 100 bucks!"
,Joewee,2007-12-14T00:18Z,"The new version of TomTom Home doesn't
have a skip button. Also this North America
Map doesn't have a mid file extension in it.
I googled the file and downloaded it off the
internet however, the activation code did not
work. "
,hotwheels4911,2007-12-14T01:01Z,"sorry but the north America map does not work when trying to unzip you get a error cab file!
any ideas? "
,Maccius,2008-06-12T11:24Z,"Attention Gradger (from 4-29-2007 comment), how'd it work out!?  I'm in the same boat!  Could you enlighten me about how to do the FL-map?"
,skweeble,2008-06-15T21:49Z,"I have just installed it and activated it absolutely fine. Im not going to the US for another 6 weeks yet so I cant say for sure whether it works, but it appears OK."
,aloggy,2008-07-29T16:51Z,I d/loaded this torrent and went through the procedure. It showed up on my TT 1 asking did i want to install but i only have a 512mb internal memory and the file is 850 or so mb how can i just get Florida map on to my device????
,mdj101,2008-08-09T17:45Z,"You dont need to download the whole 2.31gb if you only want one map!

When your torrent software loads, it should ask you to tick everything in the package you want to download. (azureus does) I selected SouthEast_USA and the KEYGEN folder.

Once downloaded, unzip the map folder and copy the folder and its contents to your TomTom via USB (make sure you back up your TT first using TT Home), you should see your other map folders in there.

Turn off your TT and then on again. enter preferences > manage maps > switch maps choose your new map. It will tell you that your map isnt registered and give you your product key.

Now, unzip the keygen folder, open the instruction file which really just tells you to copy the KEY.exe to the root of your C drive and also a copy of the mapname.mid file which you will find in the map folder.

you then run some commands from the command line. (WHICH IS VERY EASY) and you enter your product ID and get your code.

Click ""ACTIVATE"" on your TT and enter the code you where given. VIOLA, your new map is now registered.

Took me 5 minutes to install on my TT One and i had enough space for UK and SouthEast US maps."
,macbeth79,2010-02-04T21:39Z,"Activation Code does not work for this map.  I used my device code to get the activation code in DOS and entered into tomtom, but it's telling me 'this is not the correct activation code for the product USA_and_Canada.
Does anyone have any solutions?"
