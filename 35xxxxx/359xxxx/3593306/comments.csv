,GoldenScimitar,2009-03-05T03:31Z,"What a crock of shit.  A virus was found within the installation, and the installation ruined my FS directory.  If you're going to post installers that are going to ruin our FS installations as an ""up-yours"" from the companies that make these addons, you better find someplace else for that, buddy.  We don't want to see that kind of shit here.
