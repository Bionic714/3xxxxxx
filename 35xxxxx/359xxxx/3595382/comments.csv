And if you were picked and have a valid key you can download this from their site. So remind me.. whats the point of this again?"
,krutan,2007-01-13T19:12Z,"To inform people that you can sign up for the beta now? That the servers might be slow and maybe eXp2k have a fast upload speed? And no, all the accounts won't be wiped out on the 16th, if you register your key before the 14th you'll automaticly stay in the beta, this is just a stress test now, a test to max out the performence of the server."

What is linked here, as far as I know, is the European Stress Test build, which has nothing to do with the current closed beta.

So lordtarl is correct, it is actually pointless to have this here, even as a source for other testers to get their download, seeing as why would anyone download a 3gb file just to seed it and never use it?"
,spectral2k,2007-01-15T05:40Z,Actually any beta testers that log into the game during the stress test get to stay in the Beta. Its only testers who dont take part that lose the key.
,T0nT0n,2007-01-15T08:37Z,"but you're missing hte point...Turbine's closed beta has nothing to do with Codemasters' stress test.

They are two completely different beta programs, and they aren't currently running the same versions anyways.  Far as I am aware, the Euro test is at least 3 builds behind."
