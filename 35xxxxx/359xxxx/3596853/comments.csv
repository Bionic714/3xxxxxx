Seed it."
,nousmantra,2007-10-01T20:47Z,how do i get the english audio to play?
,mihaifox,2007-11-23T09:01Z,"I can hear in both languages, how do i turn one off?"
,elfmaster,2007-12-02T05:19Z,"Seriously curious as to why the Chinese and English audio tracks are both playing at the same time.  I play everything in WMP11, and have never encountered a problem like this before."
,Sxales,2008-01-16T07:34Z,Try using media player classic or vlc
,Twilight_Ghost,2008-03-05T06:41Z,blaw....windows media player does both at the same time..and vlc doesnt wanna do any english..:(
,inmytaxi,2008-04-20T17:49Z,"vlc plays both english and chinese, choose track 2 for english.

i'd prefer to hear it in chinese, but i can't get the .sub - titles to play.  I linked the file in vlc, no love.

this is a classic, thanks sxales."
,Loachdriver,2008-06-06T08:07Z,Thanks; works fine.  
,funklee916,2009-04-12T22:43Z,"Thx for the rip but seriously foreign movies shouldnt be played with an english track. Stick with the original and toss in some subtitles. English ruins GREAT foreign movies ALL the time. The killer, Hard Boil, The Bodyguard. All ruined when reworked for american television. Stick with the basics."
,aleistersenna,2009-07-30T05:10Z,"thanks,

john woo is fantastic,

bye,"
,spaceham,2010-02-04T04:30Z,"Ahm the subtitles do work... Unzip the .rar file to get the .idx file. Make sure the .idx file, the .sub file and the .avi file are all in the same folder. Then open with VLC player and go to video...subtitles and you should be able to turn them on. "
,nopahking,2012-08-07T04:01Z,"works for me.
