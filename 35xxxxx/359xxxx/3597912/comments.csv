,frogman9,2007-01-22T21:20Z,"@emachines: you're absolutely right! So here's a comment: If you want to see action, it's the right one for you. My personal opinion is: these idiots should have invested their budget in better actors and not only in speciel effects. I didn' like it, sorry."
,Bastiii,2007-01-24T15:07Z,This was the worst film i've seen in a long time!!!! really shitty movie! not worth watching
,blimeygbg,2007-01-30T14:05Z,Terrible terrible film. Have to agree with the others. Useless actors and script. I don't recomend anyone to see this film even if you have the worst taste in movies in the world.
