While I had to interrupt for now the "Elvis In The Studio" uploads, since there is some problems with some of the volumes of the 70's (i'll get it OK in some time), here it is some CDs released by FTD. This are in lossless format, the audio quality is the same as you had the original ones.

At the International
Dixieland Rocks
Fame And Fortune
It's Midnight
Memphis Sessions
Silver Screen Stereo
Sunset 6363
The Jungle Room Sessions
The NAshville Marathon


Enjoy!
