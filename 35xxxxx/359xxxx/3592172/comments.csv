This label needs our support. Otherwise it will die. And this is the last source for new material. As some of the main-bootleggers announced 2007 will be the last year of some high quality bootlegs (because of the increasing copying, burning, downloading etc) FTD will most probably be the only source for the remaining material. Don't let it also die out due to uploads and copying."

As to this, do you have all the original FTD's?? I guess you must be rich... i don't have a doubt if a true Elvis fan could afford it, they would buy them all, but not everyone can do that."
