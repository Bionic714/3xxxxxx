4) Run ""FlexLM License Utilities"" and find your Ethernet Address.

5) Open the file ""aw.dat"" with Wordpad and change ""your_host"" to whatever your Ethernet Address is without the quotes. Then change 7.000 to 8.000. Save.

I assume you have extracted the ""awkeygen.exe"" and ""aw.dat"" files from the ""WinRAR archive"" to the desktop!

1.  After you installed ""Maya"" click on ""Start"" -> ""All Programs"" -> ""Autodesk"" -> ""Common Utilities"" -> ""FlexLM License Utilities""
__________________________________________________________________________________

2.  Under ""System Settings"" copy the code from ""Ethernet Address"" to the ""aw.dat"" file and save, (you must open it with wordpad to do this!)


Normally it will look like this:

FEATURE MayaUnltd sgiawd 2008 permanent uncounted 0 \
        HOSTID=your_host


Insert the ""Ethernet Address"" replacing the ""your_host"" to:

FEATURE MayaUnltd sgiawd 2008 permanent uncounted 0 \
        HOSTID=001a92d7e859


Remember that ""001a92d7e859"" is my ""Ethernet Address"" so it will not work for you!
__________________________________________________________________________________

3.  Inside your ""Local Disk"" (C:) drive create a folder named ""FlexLM"" and send ""awkeygen.exe"" there.

4.  Drag and drop the ""aw.dat"" file you just edited on top of ""awkeygen.exe"" then double click on the ""awkeygen.exe"".

5.  Now click on ""Start"" -> ""All Programs"" -> ""Autodesk"" -> ""Autodesk Maya 2008"" -> ""Licensing"" select ""I have a license that I need to install."" -> ""Next"" -> ""Next"" -> ""Browse"" find aw.dat located on the desktop click ""Select"" -> ""Next"" and you're done! Enjoy."
