,gurgel,2007-01-24T15:49Z,"You compressed a whole dvd into a single rar-file? Brilliant, absolutely brilliant! 

Where did you learn this technique? The local bog-IT-magazine?"
,Straticus,2007-01-24T17:12Z,"Are you being facetious Gurgel? I've tested all my torrents, and they work just fine, and the quality is excellent...not sure if you're being sarcastic or not."
,Straticus,2007-01-25T10:50Z,"Actually, I have a much better idea..why don't you point me towards some of YOUR contributions to the site so I can see the PROPER method of torrent compression? Oh wait...I just did a search on you...you HAVE no contributions to the site...My mistake..."
,radagastb,2007-01-26T22:00Z,Straticus very nice of you to upload one of my favorite films. Do you have any intention of uploading Hairspray as well?
,Straticus,2007-01-28T14:10Z,"Yes, Hairspray is definitely on my list, and it's coming soon...First, I'm going to up some other cool indie/cult stuff...Slingblade is coming (AWESOME film) along with Eraserhead, and a lot of hard to find John Waters stuff...keep your eyes open for more good stuff coming really soon!
