,tig4zen,2007-09-14T02:02Z,"I saw that others said to ignore the virus warning so I tried to install the patch.  When I run it, it errors out.  I try to copy it into the game dir and it won't copy either.  The virus warning continues to come up.  Does anyone have a better place to get this patch, or any advice?"

I know anti-v sometimes tags things as Trojans that are not, but Avast! is really good about identifying the real thing.

Thanks, but no thanks.  People, take care with this one."
