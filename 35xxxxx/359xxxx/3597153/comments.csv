,artytorrent,2007-10-12T11:30Z,"I haven't downloaded this torrent, as I found version 1.7 (also cracked by AiR) elsewhere. It's a great synth. It's been superseded by ReFX's Nexus ROMpler, but if you want a quick way into making trance/electro sounds, with a much smaller download, this is a great VSTi. You can also get some excellent preset soundbanks from KVR."

,Byggmesterbob,2008-08-08T08:05Z,"yar, how do i get this to work on fruityloops tried n tried n tried wont work.. erm can someone tell me how to do it from start? thank you."
,Snowdogg007,2008-09-04T01:44Z,"well, unpack the file until you've extracted an setup.exe file..Run the install...Then copy the unpacked data into the Image Line/FL Studio ?/Plugins directory

The ? stands for the version you have, I have 7, so the folder is named FL Studio 7

Then, open fruity loops, then head for Channels/Add one/More..
Then click ""Refresh"" and then Vanguard should be on the bottom of the list in red..

Then select one of the four default samples, and use the right-mouse button to gain access to ""Insert"" and then Vanguard should be in the bottom of the list..Then just click on in and you're in!:)

I hope I helped you with this, for futher comments, just contact me...BELIEVE ME, THIS DOWNLOAD IS WORKING PERFECT! Good Job Funkiez! Thanks a lot"
