         ?  reFX presents VANGUARD, a new breed of virtual analog  ?
         ?  synthesizers.   VANGUARD   is   the   long    awaited  ?
         ?  replacement for your old 19" hardware gear which  you  ?
         ?  will never use again after you have tried VANGUARD.    ?
         ?                                                         ?
         ?  VANGUARD is a complete new product. reFX has put  all  ?
         ?  its knowledge and experience collected over the years  ?
         ?  into this project, and the result is audible: virtual  ?
         ?  analog synthesis has just made a big step forward.     ?
         ?                                                         ?
         ?  VANGUARD  combines  the good  old  analog synthesizer  ?
         ?  idea with the  latest technology. All  analog devices  ?
         ?  of classic synthesizers are emulated by  high-quality  ?
         ?  DSP (digital signal processing) functions. reFX spent  ?
         ?  a lot  of time  programming the  synthesis functions,  ?
         ?  and  the   result  is   a  warm   and  rich  sounding  ?
         ?  synthesizer plugin  with all  the benefits  of todays  ?
         ?  digital technology.                                    ?
         ?                                                         ?
         ?  VANGUARD is more than  just a simple synthesizer.  It  ?
         ?  is equipped  with 31  different type  of oscillators,  ?
         ?  including  uncommon  digital  oscillators  with fresh  ?
         ?  modulation options. There is also a huge selection of  ?
         ?  filters. 13 filter  types are onboard  with different  ?
         ?  slopes  and including  a new  kind of  combined dual   ?
         ?  -filter variations.                                    ?
         ?                                                         ?
         ?  In need of inspiration? No problem for VANGUARD - the  ?
         ?  trancegate  and  arpeggiator can  help  you out!  The  ?
         ?  trancegate is a 16-step gate to create rhythmic gated  ?
         ?  patterns and  the arpgeggiator  comes with  inspiring  ?
         ?  patterns and several play modes. In addition to these  ?
         ?  creative tools VANGUARD is equipped with a delay  and  ?
         ?  reverb.                                                ?

         ?  Oscillator  age (age)  sets the  virtual age  of the   ?
         ?  oscillators. The  older they  get, the  more unstable  ?
         ?  the frequency. Use sparingly for a more analog  feel.  ?
         ?  A   small  bug   in  the   wavetable-player  of   the  ?
         ?  oscillators has been fixed. This bug switched to  the  ?
         ?  wrong wavetables in the upper-octaves, which lead  to  ?
         ?  a slightly uncleaner sound. The setup-page has a  new  ?
         ?  option  called  ôoutput  exciterö.  This  exciter has  ?
         ?  always been enabled in previous versions, but has now  ?
         ?  been made optional for a smoother overall sound.       ?
