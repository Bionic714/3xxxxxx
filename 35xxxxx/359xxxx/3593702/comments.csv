,Distun,2007-02-09T17:05Z,"You can view movies by installing something called a VLC. Download it at http://www.videolan.org/vlc/ 

Once installed just drag the movie onto the VLC icon and it should start. Good luck :)"
,aphuk,2007-02-09T18:20Z,"the download consists of 3 folders
CD1
CD2
Sample
CD folders contain a series of files numbered consecutively plus an rar and sfv.
When I use RAR unpacker i get a message saying archive is onknown or damaged.
sample AVI file will not play. Message is CODEC or file type is unsupported? Tried VLC and it appeared to load the file but nothing happened when i pressed PLAY. ???"
