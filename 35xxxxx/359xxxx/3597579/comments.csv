To everyone else check out the files, scan then, jump on them and  dont allow access to your registry or the internet with your AVsoftware if unsure .
then enjoy."
,uraphake,2007-01-17T17:00Z,"This torrent is exactly what it says it is.
Ignore ""Headup Assimus"" and his butt-buddy ""Phelching Master Jon."""
,chatbleu,2007-01-17T17:25Z,ok I'll bite --what's the password required to open this ****?
,rowborough,2007-01-17T17:25Z,"Why do these butholes think its a good thing to make people think they have included virusus, on a torrent site how is that cool, just makes them assholes to everyone.

The files are aok if not i will give you my home add and you can come and kick the shit out of me...."
,uraphake,2007-01-17T17:31Z,"Downloading *any* file with bit torrent is risky. Always use a good virus/malware scanner before installing anything you've downloaded. Also, you should never rely upon someone else to assure you that a given file is safe to use. The best protection is YOU.

Never blindly assume that things written in comments must be true. You will find that most comments crying ""virus/trojan!"" are from the same people, writing the same thing in almost every apps torrent. Apparently they haven't outgrown diapers yet."

,dazzelitoz,2007-01-28T10:16Z,When i try to rip a dvd they ask for an Username and a cdkey. The keygen only gives password?

Thanks!"
,itfigures,2007-02-07T07:43Z,Everything seems to have installed fine but when i try and rip from a dvd it tells me it has encountered an error and must shut down. Whats the problem?
,wranzzon,2007-03-29T19:53Z,my keygen doesnt work
,kraneous,2007-04-29T01:35Z,"Ok guys heres the deal.

Xilisoft DVD Ripper Platinum v4.0.56.0928 
is the password to get in aswell as the name you use for registration.

Now! when u use the keygen you must change the selector box that starts on ""Audio Converter"", to the one that says ""DVD Ripper Platinum 4"".

if you still have problems.....well ur SOL"
