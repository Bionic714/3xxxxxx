,MCWraith8,2008-08-07T02:49Z,"Watchable but corrupt.  VLC reports:
- -Unrecognized format for 'H:\Video's\Movies\NUKED\Blade 2[2002]DvDrip[Eng]-BugZ\Blade --2[2002]DvDrip[Eng]-BugZ.txt'
Not sure if it is caused by the subtitle tracks (which are official BugZ)but it also cannot be read by dvdflick correctly."
