Do you say this to every release. This is piracy, they get the DVDs before they hit the streets a lot of the time.

,Vidpro007,2007-01-17T19:18Z,Granted.  Just didn't realize that the release date was in only two weeks.  Thought it was in March.  Figured that was a bit stretching it.  Still quite an accomplishment.  Tally Ho!
