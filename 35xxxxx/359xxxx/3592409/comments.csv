Well you have the alternativ to NOT download it!

Why complain? Upload yourself....."

I'm not sure what this has to do with you, but yes, I seeded the un-rared avi on isohunt. I am just saying the uploader could save themselves  (and others) unnecessary hassle.

I am glad the file is available, though."
