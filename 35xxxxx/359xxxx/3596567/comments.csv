Sorry to say it but, this torrent doesn't work. Unless your update it of course."
,matav,2008-07-31T12:30Z,"finally I got it to work!!!
All those who get an error message when trying to play Yuri's Revenge,
Follow these step:
> Install Red Alert 2: Allied
> Update Red Alert 2 to version 1.006
> ***Do NOT use the cracks or Copy Protection
   Remover as yet
> Install Yuri's Revenge
> Update Yuri's Revenge to version 1.001
> Keep Yuri's Revenge disc mounted in the
   virtual drive as there seems to be no NO-CD
   crack for Yuri's Revenge
> Play Yuri's Revenge
.
NOW... to play the normal Red Alert 2 but not
Yuri's revenge:
> Copy .mix files from the Allied and Soviet disc
> Apply the NO-CD Crack ONLY for Red Alert 2
   v1.006, & not for Yuri's Revenge
> Use the Copy Protection Removal Tool
> Play Red Alert 2 w/out the expansion"

anyways  If you guys would like to play online. Download this install game and Internet Components Anyways having done that. Try connecting to the internet once. you will be asked to download somthing. Accept it. Once you're finished. Exit the game and press the win key + R, you will be shown the run prompt. Type this \WINDOWS\system32\drivers\etc\hosts and start it.
you will then be asked how you want it to be open, select notepad. Or any other text editor, and in put these lines at the bottom..
