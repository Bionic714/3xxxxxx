,assassinmonk,2007-01-20T17:50Z,Thanks a lot for this one.  I've always appreciated Lois Ayres aka Sondra Stillman.  It is strange to see real-life brother & sister Buck Adams and Amber Lynn in the same movie.

If you want to prove you're not a spammer, please change at least the title of this page here!"
