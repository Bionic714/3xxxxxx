,naboth,2007-01-09T08:34Z,"Thanks!

btw, what exactly is Rosetta_Stone_Installation.iso?  If I already have the base Rosetta Stone program installed, I don't need that, correct?  And what version is it?

Thanks again!"
,Ohem,2007-01-09T16:24Z,If you already have the software in order to run the contents you don't need to install the application.
,goblynpeanut,2007-01-09T23:41Z,what folder do i put the levels in?
,Cavi Mike,2007-01-11T22:48Z,Is this 1 and 2 or just 1?
,Ohem,2007-01-12T18:09Z,"It's 1 and 2 and it doesn't matter waht folder you put the contents in, as long you use daemon tools."
,NWE,2007-01-15T21:00Z,"About the lame Virus/Trojan/Porn spam comment-terror:

Come on they're trying to confuse us by telling there are viruses and telling us that there are NO viruses in the comments. Who cares? Download and see for yourself if your antivirus reports!

BSA/MPAA/RIAA/whoever (spammer) tactic:
> Upload appz with virus
> Spam TPB appz comments with ""virus warnings"" and fake statements, to confuse people.
> Sink PirateBay(!)

Will it succeed? Hmm... At least I download and my antivirus checks, as usual. It is rather pathetic after all.."
,wolverine_matt,2007-01-22T22:17Z,"Thanks for the upload Ohem. I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw how much this software cost on Amazon! 
One question though: How do I get the User Guide?
For some reason, once unzipped, all the user guides in folder Rosetta Stone Japanese\Installation\Docs\Manuals\Users Guides are 0 KB....
The user guide would be really useful to know the correct approach to using the software.

Otherwise everything seems to work fine. Nice upload. Cheers."

,deusexmachina7261,2007-04-16T03:38Z,"ok... here is what you need to do if you want to have all the stuff working without burning any CDs.

first, download daemon tools..

second, the part that took me like 2 hours to figure out cuz im a noob, MOUNT THE .ISO!!! what i did is made two drives and MOUTED both .iso, so i can have both jap 1 and jap 2 without any trouble of taking out cds and putting in cds."

,chill808,2007-06-13T09:24Z,"If you want to burn to a disk:

1. Burn all the iso files
2. Install the Rosetta Stone Installation
3. Insert a lesson cd you want to learn
4. Open Rosetta Stone you'll see your lessons

You have to leave the cd you burned the levels to in your drive in order for the lessons to work.

Also user guide worked fine for me I clicked help and it brings up a webpage with a how to use the software. Thanks alot Ohem I've wanted to learn japanese forever."

,kamkim,2007-07-10T15:20Z,"since the rest of these faggs r jerking around i plan to help.

now aquire daemon tool if u havent already. just do a search n download right off their website, free.

what u wanna do is open the instalation folder from ur download n unpack it, in others use winrar to extract the file thats inside the folder. if u dont have winrar do a search n again download it off their website, free.

after u extract the instalation file look for a icon that says auto run. click it, this installs the software.

finally right click the daemon tool icon that should be in your tool bar. go to the top that says visual cd and then mount a drive. from
here navigate to the other download that says level 1 and mount it. 
(u must not unpack the level folders, but instead mount it as u downloaded it, even tho it may have the winrar logo).

now open the software if u havent already n u should see japanese in the top left corner.


if u have any questions please do not email me becUSE ALL I KNOW IS IN THIS POST

,darkstrike46,2008-01-03T16:50Z,"Hello everybody, i see alot of you have troubles installing this program on VISTA, well so did i but i managed to get around it.
this may or may not help you but you need to have a computer with windows xp, and a removable storaga device (USB stick,memory pen SD card,phone,ipod ect ect) with the appropriate memmory. if youv got an external had drive that would be great. but a 2 GB storage device would be fine.
install the software onto your windows XP computer, after the installation. go to C:\Program files\The Rosetta Stone
and copy the folders there.
paste them onto your device, then go to your vista machine and run it from there. it should work.
its been tested by me, on a laptop i got for xmas ^^ with vista home edition.
one slight drawback. its a slightly smaller screen, but before posting this i did a little test on it to be sure it worked correctly.
il check back to see if you have any more problems.
happy studying all :)"
,darkstrike46,2008-01-03T19:10Z,"*IGNORE MY PREVIOUS POST*
okay update ^^ 
if you can call it that..hehe
okay so basicly all you VISTA users out there should do this:
on a windows xp computer, mount the installation.iso with daemon tools(can be found on google if you search daemon tools download)
and run the installer.exe if it does nto do it straight away.
install it onto your Memory Stick or another means of storage device.
now go to your vista machine and run rosetta,
make sure you have daemon tools on both machines.
mount the level 1 iso to play the level 1 courses.

now for level 2 i would do this...leave level 2 until you have finished downloading the other parts of it.
the link was provided by wolverine_matt on the first comments page. once you have both level 2 parts. mount them both and paste all their contents into a folder. if both parts have files with the same name,seperate them for example if a file is called DOG and theres another file called DOG, call one of them DOG1 and the other DOG2 but thats just an example.
next i would download MagicISO which can be found in a torrent(the full version is needed,free trial is limited to 300MB) a crack or keygen should be provided.
now run magicISO and select all the file in the folder you made then make the ISO. dosent take that long. then instead of using the previous ISO you should use this one.
thats how to put the 2 iso files together into one.

i will try this next bit myself, but it may not work-you MIGHT be able to get all the files from the 2 isos(the level 2 one you made) to make  them into one so you can choose between the two.
im nto sure if VISTA can run the ISOS of this torrent but i am sure if you copy the TRS files from either you can run them. the TRS files from level 1 pasted into the rosetta stone directory will let you play level 1 and vice versa.

a really long post but i hope this has helped you all.
if i find anything else i will keep you updated."
[V],cezen,2008-01-22T23:07Z,"Love this, worked like a charm.  installed the rosettastone application which i downloaded here and then right mouse clicked on this file ( after installing ultraiso) and selected mount to drive G ( your letter might be different) and then open the application ( not the mounted iso).  It will detect the japanese in drive g ( or whatever your letter was) and it works perfectly!  I am SO happy!  Thanks for this awesome torrent.  Please do not download the ulitmate langauage pack. it is a code laden copy of the FREE sample you can get from rosetta stone.com.

Mount RosettaStone Application CD v2.07.nrg

After that, it'll say no language found, so you mount the level 1 units 1-4 ISO. You should get it from there.

Ok, this is what happened...

Theres Three ISO Images, the first is the installation, or foundation for the program, and the other two are the level systems, Level 1 and Level 2.... Very Simple...

BUT...

I recieved an error message :

Error Executing File
H:\Setup.exe
The requested operation requires elevation

I have PowerISO by the way, ya might wanna get PowerISO, just for the fact that the internet has these things called ISO Images, which I know and have known for awile know, anyway...
I right clicked on the Installation ISO, and choose to set PowerISO to have 3, thats three virtual drives, and I set the installation on drive H:\

Q. How did I get arround it...?
A. I have Vista Ultimate,...
01. Click start, type cmd
02. Right click on Command Prompt.
03. Choose Run as administrator.
04. At the command prompt I typed the following...

05. Start H:\setup.exe

VOLLA...

It setup, VERY NICE...

Then It choose to run after the installation, and then there were no languages in there, so I chose quite in the bottom right hand corner of the program, went into the level folder, right clicked on level 1, ISO, and chose PowerISO, mount to drive, drive I:\

Then I chose the second level folder, level 2, ISO, and right clicked on it, PowerISO, mount to drive J:\...
Closed it, Double clicked on the Shoutcut on the desktop, It started up, and would you believe, the level were there, VERY EASY PEOPLE....

So, just mount the images to 3 different virtual drives...

Right click on cmd, choose to run as admin...

Type Start H:\setup.exe

Very Easy...

I know how to say Cat, Neku... HA HA HA....

,nicodog,2009-02-26T07:07Z,"Installs just fine in Linux under Wine.

To install, just mount the installation.iso as a loop device:

mount -o loop /path/to/installation.iso /mnt/path

then run setup.exe:

wine setup.exe

For each language, just mount the different levels.iso as a loop device and make sure the mount path is set as CD-ROM in winecfg.

Great seed, thanks a lot!"
,frodnez,2009-03-20T01:10Z,"Can someone please tell me step by step how to do this? I have no idea what the hell ""mounting"" is, so I'd really appreciate someone explaining this all. 
Thank you!"
,tjc010,2009-03-22T00:52Z,"Mounting is essentially taking a .iso image file and burning it to a disk using an image burner. Some well known image burners are Nero (what i use), isoburn, Magiciso, Alcohol 120%. u could most likely find those here at TPB. once u have one of those, use the function ""burn disc from image"".once u have that done, run the disc and it should work."
,nunnayabizniz,2009-04-09T11:17Z,"MOUNTING is the software equivalent of inserting a disk into a CD Drive. The file is the CD, the Virtual Drive is the CD/DVD Drive and MOUNTING is the disk read command. Go to http://www.slysoft.com/en/virtual-clonedrive.html and it is simple."
,magickam,2009-05-04T00:30Z,This is Version 2.
,AcexMace,2009-06-13T10:35Z,"@frodnez
Yeah, since you already know what mounting is from the other people, I just want to recommend 'Daemon Tools' for it. Google it if you want it.

I'm downloading now, I'll seed as soon as I can. Future thanks for the torrent and helping my Japanese skills.

-thanks Ohem-"
,iabandonedmychild,2009-07-08T08:47Z,"Whenever I start downloading this torrent, it will download for a while and then my internet connection will just go out. I don't understand. I lowered the download speed and upload speed and the bandwidth allocation but it always cuts off my internet when I download it for a while. This doesn't happen with other torrents. WHY?"
,embee6657,2009-07-23T23:57Z,"I really can't get this to work at all, when I tried to mount the installation iso it came up with a promp saying it couldn't continue and now it just won't open. It took me ages to download this and if someone could help me I would be really greatful; step by step guide maybe? "
,FULLMETALRICH,2009-08-16T21:05Z,"Alright ladys and gents,
In order to make thees ISO's onto a dvd you need to download DVD Decrypter. You guys can get it for free on this site.
http://download.qj.net/DVD-Decrypter-3.5.4.0-Software-Audio-Video/pg/12/fid/21334/catid/29
In order to get it though u need WinZip. 

Ok now that you have dowloaded it, goto Mode , then ISO, and chose Write W. 

Now that it is set to write on a dvd open the little folder in the Source siction next to the ""please select a file....""

Look for the files and chose them. 

Now on the bottom right hand corner youll see settings. I set my ""Write Speed"" to what ever it says on my DVD. I just think thats better. But now click on the icon that show ""harddrive converting to DVD. And leave your computer alone. Some computer tend to make CDs or DVDs skip when your burning and missing with your computer. Now just make all your DVDs.

So i know it seems like i aint got shit to do cause i wrote all this. And well......

Your right! 

But it is cause i know there are people out there like me who havent heard of ISO's untill now. So this is for those people."

,massgamer,2009-12-01T15:44Z,"Thanks for the torrent ^_^.
Funny, I'm learning my second language illegally.
Who the hell cares. I want to understand the other half of what Sony is talking about."
,massgamer,2009-12-01T15:59Z,"If anyone is having trouble, I am willing to help. 

To mount an ISO, you must have
1. The ISO you wish to mount
2. Mounting software (I use DAEMON tools lite)

1. Get and install DAEMON tools lite (if you haven't already)
2. Restart your PC to complete install.
3. Run DAEMON tools.
4. Right click on the disk icon w/ the lightning bolt on the lower right corner of your screen.
5. Go to Virtual CD/DVD-ROM > Devive 0 > Mount Image.
6. A file select screen will come up. Browse for the ISO that you downloaded or made, then open it.
7. Now it acts just like a CD inserted into your CD drive.

This is good for backups too, especially if you have a DVD, and have a CD only drive."

The sound was working fine the first few secs I opened it and started a lesson, but it stopped working right after I finished the first slide and can't seem to figure out what's wrong with it. 

Anyone else have a problem with the sound or anyone know how to fix it? "
,adidasnova,2010-03-16T18:33Z,I downloaded it really easily but and I mounted it into MagicDisc but when I tried to add it to Rossetta Stone it said there isn't a CD in the drive. Could someone walk me through the steps with MagicDisc?

,harry2469,2010-03-22T22:04Z,i think some people may not be realising that the files you get from the torrent ARE the iso's and that the data inside them is irrelivent
,emmettmaloney,2010-07-28T09:37Z,"HELP! I mounted the ISO's correctly, ran setup, but when I open the program it says no languages available."
,alwayslie,2010-12-23T02:31Z,"a quick how to:
1) burn the 3 cds or mount them one by one, for example with iso-buster or deamon tools lite.

2) install the programm from 1st (install) cd. 

3) then insert/mount other cd and start the program

on my xp system this version 2.sth worked fine. however it doesnt recognise language cds from newer version of Rosetta Stone."
