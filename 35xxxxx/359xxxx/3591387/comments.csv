,squishsquash,2007-01-07T10:03Z,How hard is it to do them one by one?
,carpe_nox,2007-01-07T16:53Z,"If I do them one by one then each torrent would get such a small bandwidth that people would just give up.  If you can't handle that, don't bother downloading.

Or, you know, learn how to use your bittorrent client to download only the ones you want."
,squishsquash,2007-01-07T17:06Z,"I was only asking due to alot of people only have a certain download limit, thought once in a while people may seperate things so they can pick which is easier, and yes i do know how to use a bit torrent client."
