,Tzarro,2007-02-09T03:24Z,"Hey, I don't know how to get this to work on LAN. It just says ""waiting for host..."" or something like that in an empty lobby. We tried on both machines, but to no avail. I extracted the files into the directory fine and installed the patch thing too. Singleplayer works fine, but its just the LAN that does not want to work. We also made suure the beta was added under the exceptions list in windows security center.

Any help would be appreciated.

Thanks."
