,somoney,2008-05-30T20:32Z,"4kids dub'd and brought to the English speaking masses what only the hard core anime fans knew. One Piece ROCKS!

I cant fault 4kids one bit.  They took out religious reference to get it ready for Kids cartoons.  If you haven't noticed by now American television is without religion accept for a few channels dedicated to it.

This is ""THE"" version to get. 100% English!"
