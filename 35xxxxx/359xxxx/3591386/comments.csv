,Rivenshield,2007-01-07T07:37Z,"Thanks. I enjoy the whole sharing thing -- makes me feel more Christmas-y than Christmas did -- but I wish to hell I knew why I have to publish everything *twice* before I show up as a seeder, or if one works and the other doesn't, or if both do, and/or why....

Oh well.  As long as you get the tunes."

,wotthe7734,2007-07-11T19:33Z,"Ahhhhhhhhhhhh, La Roque 'n' Roll.......... I love the Baltimore Consort..........
BTW, about ""J'ai vu le loup""....... (if I remember right) - something they don't tell you in the liner notes - back in the day, ""voir le loup"" was a euphemism similar to ""gettin' it on,"" ""doin' the nasty,"" and that other well-known French euphemism: ""baiser,"" etc. etc. =nudge nudge, wink wink="

,twistles,2009-05-15T02:29Z,"Lots of fun stuff in this torrent.  Thanks!  Only came across these on account of a comment left on one of mine, so thanks for that too!  Here's to hoping lots of new folk are introduced to this earlier music :)

You wrote above of a couple of the included CDs as being, ""music from the very early colonial American period"" : presumably what the CD cover says?  As you are probably aware the tracks are mainly dances published by John Playford from 1651 in London, and a couple have a history that probably goes back a couple of centuries further.

Now of course, settlers from England would have carried their popular tunes over the Atlantic with them, but these are definitely English folk melodies, not proto-American.  The CD titles are thus perhaps a marketing decision by Hesperus? :)  *shrug* good recordings at any rate."
