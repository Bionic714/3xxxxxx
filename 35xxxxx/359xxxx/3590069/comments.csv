,runkill.com,2007-01-26T06:05Z,has anyone started ripping season 5
,The Lim Sup,2007-02-05T05:43Z,Finding episodes of season 5 is hard. There hasn't been a dedicated rippers besides IcyFlames and even then that releaser is sporatic. I have only a bunch of mixed quality files of the season. Not as good as the other seasons though.
,a5cii,2007-02-24T16:22Z,"Cool, all downloaded but I can't open them.  HAve tried kazza codec pac, XVID.org, nero showtime, winamp, Videolan, any suggestions on how to view them would be greatly appreciated
"
,mfyr,2007-03-19T22:11Z,Thanks!
,The Lim Sup,2007-03-19T23:12Z,Use video lan client/VLC media player. You need to have XviD codec installed as well.
,Phoenix999,2007-04-11T07:31Z,"Season four is NOT present in this. Other than that, good quality."
,Sixmagnet,2007-06-28T01:01Z,"If someone could seed seasons 4 and 5, I would greatly appreciate it! This torrent is good stuff! "

,hurricanesoccer,2008-05-25T06:12Z,"I'm seeding +3x on a cable link, it's AWESOME quality. And who gives a shit if it's labeled wrong, IT'S FREE FUCKHEAD."
,Asm92784,2008-05-28T07:46Z,"Why the crap do people feel the need to post the seasons episode numbers are wrong.  Who gives a crap, and anyways whoever said they episode numbers are wrong did not read the torrent title as it says volumes 1-4 not seasons 1-4.  They are numbered by the DVD release, not by season numbers so they are in fact correct.  I dont mean to rant, but it seems like every torrent for TV shows anymore has comments of people constantly debating this.  And before anyone else points it out, I am aware of the irony of me posting this comment as a way to debate someone on this issue. Anyways thanks for the upload."
,teamsamson888,2008-08-06T07:25Z,thanks
,BloodLogic,2008-10-02T23:02Z,"Hey, ya'll, this is missing season 5, plus it's missing the extras and the movie. Download the complete s1-5, + extras, with perfect quality here: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4421241/Aqua_Teen_Hunger_Force_-_Seasons_1-5___Extras_%5BDVD-Rip%5D"
,The Lim Sup,2008-11-09T11:17Z,"I'm glad to see this torrent is still going strong. To the idiots that didn't read the fucking title, the episodes are enumerated as per the dvd's they come from. Too bad the showed tanked then died.

Thanks to BloodLogic for giving me no credit to ripping, converting and uploading the original 4 volumes."
