,bengel,2007-01-17T21:22Z,"Interesting read so far, but it's not clear who wrote this book or where it's been published (if it has indeed been published at all).

I would be very interested in seeing links to any indepedent, informed comments on this paper/book."
,funxlab,2007-02-01T21:25Z,"Agni1915, 
Your nick is inspired by Agni Missile or one of few heroz of India probably ?. As far as I know Indian neighbor (Pakistan) is a neculear state now, one of the strongest Muslim country with good (if not bigger) economy and Militry and poverty level is much lower than in India. 
I dont know what is the criteria of failure state but super power failing in Iraq and Afghanistan are not given such titles. India (not a super power) failing in Kashmir. Such titles suites them as people are more happy in Pakistan when I visited both Pakistan and India last year."
,agni1915,2007-02-06T20:58Z,The book explains what the criteria for a failed state is and attempts to show how Pakistan meets those criteria.
,eusarsn,2007-05-01T11:03Z,"After reading it all. I would say that agni (apparently from india) has tried his/her best to gather all the NEGATIVE/propaganda stuff gainst pakistan. A far as theories are concerned, I can prove that the class difference, human living conditions, weird customs and human right violations are at their peak in india.
All I can say is OPEN YOUR EYES :)"

So it's only a matter of time for Fuckistan to be destroyed.

""Chips are down. Policies are unclear; clouded. Institutions are wilting. Law and order is out of control. Law enforcement authorities have gone haywire. No let-up in extrajudicial killings. Target killing goes on in different parts of the country on a daily basis - most visible in the metropolitan city of Karachi and Balochistan. Terrorism and militancy is on the rise. People have become intolerable of others. Security agencies are unequal to the task. Even the protector of last resort is facing multiple crises. Cracks are creeping in. Corruption is rampant and unchecked. Mind-boggling scandals hit the media, every other week. Prices are skyrocketing. Loadshedding goes on for 10 to 16 hours every day. Trains are being cancelled. The economy is in doldrums. Governance is in the pits. Insecurity stalks the land. The countryâ&#x20AC;&#x2122;s territorial integrity is violated every other day. Drones and foreign Special Forces kill Pakistanis with impurity. Peopleâ&#x20AC;&#x2122;s representative houses - the elected Assemblies and the Senate - are powerless and clueless. Fake degrees are rampant as are fudged figures. They pass resolutions which remain unimplemented. Meaningless debates are held. Power is concentrated in the hands of the military chief and ISI. Treasury is empty and unbearable burden of loans are breaking the back and taking Pakistan to default. No one wants to invest in Pakistan. We are isolated and soon will become a pariah nation shunned by the comity of nations....."" 

Is this you call life with dignity? Death is better then this retched life of a Pakistani. No wonder suicide bombers are helping others reach Jannat."
