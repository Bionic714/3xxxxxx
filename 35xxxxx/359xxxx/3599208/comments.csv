Note that the screen is black when you start the game. Just press X a few times or something to get to the menu. ;)"

,le639,2008-01-12T13:55Z,What folder should it be in? Does it work on fw 3.70 m33-2?
,dick_head101,2008-01-31T22:23Z,"Bloody hell... Can somebody please tell me how to work this? It doesn't even say what firmware it is designed for. Why the hell isn't there a readme file, telling you where to put it, what to name it etc.? Not everybody is a l33t hacker, it would only take one simple paragraph to ensure that everybody can enjoy this. God I hate all this pissing about, I JUST WANT TO PLAY GTA2 FOR FUCK'S SAKE!!!!!

Sorry about the rant, it was a bit unnecessary... I'm just sick of having to fuck about for an hour for want of a basic explanation. It's so easy to just explain things rather than assuming that people already know. And the firmware version could have easily been included in the title, so people with the wrong firmware wouldn't have to go to all the trouble of downloading and trying to install software that is of no use to them.

There. Rant finished. I would appreciate it if one of you beings of supreme digital knowledge would explain to us lowly mortals how this fucker works."
