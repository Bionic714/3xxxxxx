Come on they're trying to confuse us by telling there are viruses and telling us that there are NO viruses in the comments. Who cares? Download and see for yourself if your antivirus reports!

Cos i got them and hardly any off the channels work and the ones that do are sh***. i was gonna download this but i am worried it may have trojans in it.

Anyone know??????????????????????????????????????
