,fisIvinden,2008-01-18T17:37Z,"it's not there??    damn..   that's a hot track..  got the album, but it's lost somewhere..   like that Battle of 2001 track aswell..

but ""when the fat lady sings"" by Gza on the soul assasins 2 is the best one"

,Ocified,2008-02-22T17:22Z,"Hey SpaceAce...If you have a torrent for Showbiz & AG ""Goodfellas"", Lord Finesse ""Return of the Funkyman"", Diamon D ""Stunts, Blunts, and Hip Hop"" and Da Youngstas ""The Aftermath"" I would be grateful for a seed.  I'll keep the live.

Any King Tee, mainly ""Act A Fool"" ""At Your Own Risk"" and ""The Triflin Album"" would be great too.

It sucks I can't find these.  I had these all on cassette tapes and they're lost now.  I can't find these albums anywhere either.  If you have them, let me know.  Hopefully you will see this.  Thanks."

,noYac,2008-07-25T18:33Z,"SpaceAce, do you possibly have Fredro Starr - Firestarr? I know it's not from the 90's but it's a wicked record and it's really hard to find on the internets.

Btw, there should be a hiphop-tracker!"
,vivalarevolucion,2008-12-02T01:26Z,Please upload the bush babees CD you have would be very grateful and willing to seed. Help keep the music revolucion alive
,StarkofWinterfell,2011-11-01T18:32Z,That wasn't Soul Assassins Vol 2 it was Soul Assassins Take Aim.  Do you have Soul Assassins Ch. 2?
,delaslow,2012-07-09T08:05Z,Good stuff guys. Thanks a lot!
