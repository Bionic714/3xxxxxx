This is a digital TV capture of the Siddharta's last Petrolea tour concert. The concert was performed for free in the center of Ljubljana on Presernov Trg on 27-12-2006. The DVD starts with band comments about the tour (in Slovene) then continues with the, unforunately, heavily cut concert. The concert was shortened from about 140 min of performance to aboout 75 min.

This is a must for all rock fans...even if the songs are in Slovene. They are hard to understand sometimes anyway ;)
