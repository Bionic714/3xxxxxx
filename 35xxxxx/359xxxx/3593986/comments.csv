,CrazyTerabyte,2008-02-24T01:44Z,"The name of two episodes are incorrect:
01x04 - ""The Sidewalk Soiler"" should be ""Sidewalk Soiler""
01x05 - ""Devil and a Guy Named Webster"" should be ""The Devil and a Guy Named Webster""

The file ""Tripping the Rift - First Episode (Demo) (Adult).mpg"" is the ""Love and Darph"" pilot episode.

According to Wikipedia, the episodes 02x01 and 02x02 are swapped in this torrent."
,BabelonKing,2008-03-25T15:43Z,"Thanks for the Torrent. I've watched the Demo (Adult) episode and I have to say, I wish they'd make more episodes like this one. Although, it just feels more like a teaser. But still, good work."
,hepek,2008-04-18T15:15Z,"thanks for this one...I never watched before this show and think it is great.
hope we will have soon more seasons of this
tnx"
