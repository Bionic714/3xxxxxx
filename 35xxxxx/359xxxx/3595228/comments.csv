,NWE,2007-01-15T20:55Z,"About the lame Virus/Trojan/Porn spam comment-terror:

Come on they're trying to confuse us by telling there are viruses and telling us that there are NO viruses in the comments. Who cares? Download and see for yourself if your antivirus reports!

BSA/MPAA/RIAA/whoever (spammer) tactic:
> Upload appz with virus
> Spam TPB appz comments with ""virus warnings"" and fake statements, to confuse people.
> Sink PirateBay(!)

Will it succeed? Hmm... At least I download and my antivirus checks, as usual. It is rather pathetic after all.."
