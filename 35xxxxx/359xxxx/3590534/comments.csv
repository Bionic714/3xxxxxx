Thanks for your help, and God bless you too."

You think you understand the Bible, but you don't. Jesus says that HE REVEALS the Holy Scriptures to those who seek Him. Your little mind is not good enough to understand it. You need to have a relationship with the author in order to. The language of the Bible is righteousness, without which you cannot understand it."
