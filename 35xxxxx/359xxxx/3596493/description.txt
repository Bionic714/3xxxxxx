Here we go. These are two awesome old animated movies, Heavy Metal and Heavy Metal 2000. Good luck, and I hope you all help me seed because I am trying to pump as many unique/cool DVDRips on this site as fast as I can, which leaves me having to jump off my torrents after a week or so. I am begging, because I want to push as much cool shit out as I can, and who doesn't like cool-ass DVD copies?
Next ones shuld be a few cool-ass, rare Bakshi films, just by the by.

By the by, here's a nice graphical list of all my DVDs. If I get any requests I think are good, or if enough people ask for something, I'll torrent it. So hey, post away! http://bradp.co.uk/fredryk/dvds/ I usually go for the shit that is kinda obscure and that I think people would love, though, so you know.
