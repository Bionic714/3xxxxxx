,KioSan,2007-02-24T22:11Z,"Thanks... but why are Heavy Metal 2000's size 5,74 GB and HEAVY_METAL 7,79 GB ?
Would'n it have been better to rip it first with DVD Shrink or CloneDVD2 so both had the size og 4,5 GB * 2 = 9 Gb instead of a total of 13,53 GB... and only 1 Seeder please ?

Now it wil takes forever to DL  :-(

Regards KioSan "

All of you leechers out there- would be nice if you would keep it up for a bit as well!

Have you seen Bakshi's ""Hey, Good Lookin?"" It's a story set in 50's New York (I think). It's extremely had to find, but I bought a DVD-Rip from someone off of ebay, so I have it. Leave a comment if you're interested."
,myidwastaken,2008-04-01T07:20Z,"Why are these files so huge compared to the other movie files? i see copies of the first and second heavy metal videos, and and they're only about 700-800mb each. Where is the extra 11gb coming from? i'm honestly not trying to be an ass or anything, i'm just curious befor i spend the time dl'ing"
,notelpa,2008-04-07T21:35Z,this version of heavy metal is ''colectors edition'' or ''superbit colection''?
,piet7104519,2008-04-14T00:41Z,"Hi MethodLoser, these posts are awesome but I already have a DVD version of Heavy Metal 1981. Any chance 2 have u to post the 200 sequel separately?

,Wopatoolie,2008-06-12T20:20Z,"why are these files so huge? this is a waste of a LOT of time. look around, i know people can find these around pirate bay or other torrent sites in a much smaller file size and quality is just as good. "
,marshell89,2008-08-15T01:59Z,"Please Seed Im been waiting for 2 weeks and its still 5%.

,Otyebat,2010-07-07T00:47Z,"I actually just (finally) signed up to piratebay to reply to comments on here about why the file sizes are so big...it's because these are .INFO and .VOB files. I DL'ed this not paying attention to the file sizes and am now encoding them (which on my laptop is going to take a really long time.)

If you have the time and patience to do so then DL this file, otherwise there IS another torrent on this site that will give you both Heavy Metal and Heavy Metal 2000 that are encoded to .avi."
