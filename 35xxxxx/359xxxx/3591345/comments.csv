,Lady Morag,2007-06-22T15:59Z,"Hej, with a name like Tardis3 you must be a Dr. Who fan? If so maybe you could tell me what the hell happened to the tardis, I´ve been living in Sweden for over 16 years and they have just started showing the Eccleston Dr. and the inside of the tardis is almost unreconisable. It used to be white with a floor, now it looks like something out of a Borg ship."

,shawnee6d,2007-11-12T03:33Z,"Just wanted to say thank to Tardis and all the others who are seeding this. You all are awesome, I'll follow the trend and seed for awhile as well. Thanks again."
,PSPlaystation,2007-12-08T10:43Z,"i know it sounds cheeky but i just need episodes 7-10, i downloaded the whole series ages ago but for some reason the disc with those episodes has stopped working:(

but with your help i'll make it complete again, so thanks for what i'm about to download."
,Stereophonics,2007-12-10T10:42Z,"is anyone gonna seed???????  i know i've only given it 24hours but i've never had a slower download.

i got the smallest amount of content of anyone on this but still am uploading 6x faster than i'm downloading.

i'll look for another to download, this has way to many leechers.

shit as i'm typing this i'm now seeding 10x faster so goodbuy. here's one person that does seed signing off, i can't stand leechers."
,sydell,2008-01-15T00:41Z,"PLEASE SEED!

,zero-kill,2008-02-27T05:48Z,Yes this is in HD (as far as HD can be broadcasted and then compressed and then seeded by a torrent swarm and then being used constantly). Great quality =P

,chinthor,2008-06-27T23:35Z,"Just a shout to all Who fans. And Lady Morag? By the end of the Doctor's 7th incarnation (McCoy) he had changed the interior quite a bit. You see most of this in the Doctor Who movie that gives us number 8, played by Paul McGann. Sometime after that and before the first Eccelson episode, he went through many adventures, an entire Time War, and another regeneration. Methinks a lot can happen in the midst of all that. Not the least of which being he obviously had to make MANY repairs and rebuilds using substandard parts and facilities. Go figure."
,Carpe_Mofo,2008-12-15T02:20Z,"Actually, in one episode, the different look of the tardis is explained. It's a visual theme that can be selected at the doctors choosing. I think he even uses a word like 'desktop theme' or 'system theme'. If I'm not mistaken it's either one of the episodes where Sarah Jane makes an appearance or the episode 'Time Crash' I'm not sure, I think it might even be one of the season four finale episodes (which feature Sarah Jane). It is interesting though, people always assume that everything in science fiction has to have a logical reason, but asthetics and ceremony would play a part too, especially with time lords as they are known as being sanctimonious and pompous."
,Carpe_Mofo,2008-12-15T02:21Z,"And excuse my horrible manners, thanks for the upload!"
