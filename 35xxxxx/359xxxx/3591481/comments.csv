,TheUnit2,2010-04-03T07:32Z,"Thanks for the upload! It was a bit of a challenge to find the original untouched ROM's. Many other sites and other torrents had modified ROMs, but yours are the original North American ones. To verify, I removed the first 16 bytes (header) then calculated the MD5 hashes and compared with the listings at dorando.emuverse.com.
