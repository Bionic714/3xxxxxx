,VladimirMolotov,2007-01-24T13:47Z,"When I go to http://shop.01media.com/info.asp?ProductID=33260 , I find the following remark:

""Notice that theres no way to dump DS games with DS-Xtreme (or another card in the DS slot). This is one of cons compared to products like G6, M3 or Supercard.""

Is this true, or is it nonsense? I don't know much about these cards (actually nothing), but I gave my 5-year old son a DS Lite, and of course I'm interested in downloading games for it. I have started downloading this torrent, but I need to be sure that I can actually play these games if I buy an Xtreme card?"
,VladimirMolotov,2007-01-24T15:11Z,"Hey

I'm a newbie when it comes to DS-related stuff. Would someone please explain how this works? I bought a DS for my son, and of course I would like to surprise him with hundreds of games. I figured that I should buy the X-treme card, but how does it work? You unzip the files and plug the card in the USB. Then you transfer some games to the card and stick it into your DS, and then everything is up and running??? Forgive my ignorancy...."
,pgabor,2007-01-24T18:44Z,"I saw working the M3 DS Lite + Passcard 3. This combo runs DS/GBA games from Slot2.

I am planning to a buy an M3 DS Simply. This card is Slot1 one and there is no need to buy a passcard. (It contains the PassMe). It can play DS games only. (not GBA.)

I think you can find many usable falsh cards, I don't know wich one is available in your country.

Thats all what I know now from forums and friends :)

,pgabor,2007-01-24T18:44Z,Please correct me if i am wrong. :)
,WormSlayer,2007-01-25T01:11Z,"pgabor: I can garentee almost all of these work on the DS-Xtreme. (On mine anyway)

The country code indicates the language:

U = universal? - english
E = euro - usually english, sometimes multiple european languages, I think I saw one german language only game)
J = japanese (the korean, etc games tend to get lumped in with these)

VladimirMolotov: What they mean is you cant use the DSX to copy the data off a DS cart. You can however load data someone else has already ripped. (Like the roms in this torrent)

the process you describe is exactly how it works - your pc sees the card as a generic usb flashdrive, copy the file over, unplug, boot DS, enjoy.

I just bought my DS and DSX for christmas, so I cant offer any advice relating to other cards."

,gcahamilton,2007-01-28T14:51Z,"Is a selection list of games that have been loaded on the DS-Xtreme displayed on the DS?  How do I select a game, play it, and then select another from the DS-Xtreme?  Thanks."
,WormSlayer,2007-02-02T01:44Z,"gcahamilton: When you buy a DS-X, be sure to tell them I 'm due commission for selling the damn thing ;)

Yes, its dead easy to use and just lists whatever .nds files are loaded on the card. To load a different one, you reboot the unit (power off, then on again), load the DS-X and select something else from the list. 

Since I seem to be pimping them, I should say the DSX also has a neat little mp3/ogg player built into the firmware. Not nearly as featureful as moonshell, but still cool. (And of course you can still use moonshell to play mp3, divx, etc.)"

you need to buy one of these.

http://www.consolesource.com/ecomm/catalog/R4-Slot-1-All-In-One-NDS-Lite-Backup-Solution-p-2566.html

search around the site. I bought the R4 and a memory card separate for $60. but after i made my order i found they were offering them both together for $20 cheaper :.. ( but i couldnt find the link.

They work on the older big Grey DS or the newer DS lite model as well. I'm currently using the R4 model on my DS Lite."

,spankbot,2009-02-11T03:12Z,CycloDS Evolution is simply the easiest way to play these (I use it with a DS Lite).  CycloDS is a drag and drop solution - no mods or flashing required.  It's cheap too.  Order from www.nxpgame.com
,demonickilr,2009-05-28T06:54Z, dreadpiratedashley-I think the games would work much better if u have an R4

,WormSlayer,2009-08-27T06:59Z,"dragonboy690 - That is a Japanese version of Tsubasa Chronicle Vol 2 that slipped in somehow.

+1 internets for being the first person to notice in nearly 3 years :D"
,Timewarptwo,2009-10-05T00:15Z,I used an Acekard2 DSi which is a slot 1 card from www.acekard.com it works in the DSL and the DSi (I have both consoles and 2 of these cards) I use both of them with a 4GB micro SDHC memory card each. This slot 1 card can utilize up to a 32GB Micro Memory card. I only paid $26.00 for each card and about $6 or $7 for each micro memory card on Ebay. They offer EXCELLENT support. I highly recommend this slot 1 card. Programs load fast and there is no slowdown or speed lag like other cards. Just drag and drop your games onto the memory card. Also you don't have to flash your consoles firmware so it doesn't void your warranty. These are not clone cards. On the Acekard web site they have recommended sellers and I chose a USA seller but they list sellers for all over the world. I am no way affiliated with Acekard. I am fairly new to this concept of slot 1 cards so I was very sckeptical. This card was so easy to set up and use I bought 2 of them. I LOVE this card so much I just wanted to share these with you.
