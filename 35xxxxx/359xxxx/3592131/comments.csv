,Getus,2007-01-08T09:18Z,and we would want to download it why?
,longlivetheking,2007-01-09T14:19Z,Where is the crack?
,Nocturn3,2007-01-09T19:43Z,"I can't get this to work, with or without (what i assume is) the crack. (The .exe in the ""securom"" folder).  

No error messages, just a timer for a few seconds then nothing."
,longlivetheking,2007-01-09T22:16Z,"The .exe in Securom folder isn't cracked. It's the original file( protected with SecuROM version 4.83.11 ). Also, there is a good chance the game is in french ( I think english version had safedisc...)."
