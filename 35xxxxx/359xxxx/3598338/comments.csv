,sirmattia,2007-01-18T17:16Z,"160 MB?????
the game was at least 10MB....5 floppies"
,Azgarde,2007-01-18T17:27Z,All done.  Thank you very much.
,Skrotnisse4,2007-01-18T17:30Z,"sirmattia: your floppyversion didn't have speech, i belive."
,marha007,2007-01-19T17:45Z,"I canÂ´t get the sound to work, is there a known problem with newer sound cards?

I have a Creative Soundblaster Audigy 2 ZS.
"
,j35ter,2007-01-19T22:13Z,Try using DosBox (dos emulator)
,satelietje,2007-01-20T12:58Z,You Can also use ScummVM for this game....
,marha007,2007-01-20T15:15Z,"Thanks!

However I still could not get the voice to work with either of these emulators.

With ScummVM I could see some sound warnings during the game:

WARNING: loadVocFromStream invalid header!
WARNING: StartSfxSound failed to load sound!

I guess this could be the reason... any ideas?"
,marha007,2007-01-20T15:20Z,"Actually it was my own fault... =)

When trying to fix the game to run in a command promt I played with the files a bit.

After deleting my new copy of the MONTER.SOG file it started to work!

Thanks for the help!!"
,makini,2007-03-04T17:01Z,"I really recommend using ScummVM, it solves sooo many problems."
,tw.ozz,2007-03-14T08:32Z,"I got the music do work fine.  Though I can't get the speech sounds (tried using Scummvm) - also I deleted that monter file.

Any other ideas on how to get the voice effects ie; the mp3s to work?
Thanks"

i need to relive my youth !"
,bassface44,2007-12-21T19:28Z,"help!
when i try to play this game using SCUMM, a text window instead pops up saying ERROR: charset 1 is out of bounds.

 does anyone have any idea how to make it work?"
,gregersamsa,2007-12-30T16:13Z,"Cool! With speech!? Can't wait to hear that. I'm going to try it with ScummVM, sure hope that works.

Thanks makini!"
,Spatvark,2008-02-03T03:39Z,"I could be wrong, but I think the MONSTER.SOG (which should be .SOU anyway) is too small; I grabbed a different Fate of Atlantis from another torrent on TPB, and that one file is 142mb, and more importantly, the sound works. The torrent was called ""Adventure Games, LucasArts Old Classic with ScummVM"""
,narcronics111,2008-06-22T11:18Z,"as said already, this works perfectly with scummvm.

I loved this game and still do. I will seed for as long as I can."
,lucasius,2008-11-25T09:01Z,"Thanks makini!

Loved playing this game many years ago, never figured it out though, time for another whirl!

Cheers"
,Valthonin1,2008-12-18T08:24Z,"I've been having a bit of a problem running this game. I'm new to both torrents and scummVM, so please excuse any noobish-ness.

I clicked 'Download this Torrent' and it downloaded the file successfully using LimeWire. I then downloaded ScummVM, and it seems to be working as it should. However, when i go through the tutorial at the ScummVM website and click 'Add Game' I choose the file in which the game file is in like I should and yet it says there is no game in that file. 

I thought the possible problem could be that I moved the game file around a bit to try out different locations for ScummVM to find the download from, or it could be that i downloaded it from LimeWire instead of the two supplied by TPB. The file is a 'rar' type. I wanted to bring the problem here first because I think the forum at ScummVM looks down on people who download the games free instead of having the original disks. Thanks for any help."
