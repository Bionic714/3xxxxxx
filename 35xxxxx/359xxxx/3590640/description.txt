Blurb: This is the dubbed movie released in America by 20th Century Fox and Fox Kids. It basically comprises of the first three Japanese movies squished together, with several scenes altered and a voice-over by Kari added so that it makes a coherent story. Quite a few scenes were rearranged or removed to make it more exciting to American viewers (as well as many many more spoken lines and terrible jokes being added), and the main story of the third one was changed to fit in with the overall plot. I fixed the damage.
