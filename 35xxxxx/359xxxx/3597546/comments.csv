,oktan,2007-01-18T00:23Z,lemmings are cool
,vivaciousvandal,2007-02-26T06:05Z,"my computer has informed me that Lemmings can't run because readdib.dll isn't there, but it definitely is. Did anyone else have a problem with this?"
,ineedbettername,2007-04-17T08:58Z,"@vivaciousvandal: Here's a solution to your problem:
1. Open the RUN prompt.
2. Type in regsvr32 ""C:\Windows\System32\readdib.dll"" or wherever the DLL file is.
3. Press enter.
4. ???
4. Profit!"

,sparky2002b,2009-04-18T20:59Z,"IMO, the best way to use this (since it's so old now - Windows 95) is to download Lemmini (http://lemmini.de/), a Java rewrite of the Lemmings engine, then just use the original graphics from this torrent."
