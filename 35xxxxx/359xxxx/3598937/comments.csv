,ETIENNE46664,2007-02-01T13:05Z,Hey I was just wondering if anyone can comment on the quality of this torrent and if it is a TV rip. Cheers
,fender_player03,2007-02-07T20:41Z,"hey, I'm having a hard time getting these to play. anyone have a player suggestion?
Thanks for any help."
,rgunn4,2007-03-29T14:05Z,"HardSlam: Thanks for such a great Torrent. Look forward to catching up on childhood memories from this series. 

fender_player03: I use VLC media player and the videos play fine even when it's still downloading. "
,ecorona,2007-03-30T02:57Z,"What the hell? 14 seeders and 110 leechers?!? C'mon, share up people so we can all download faster!

By the way, why do some of the episodes have the text ""[dummy]"" in the file names?"
,ecorona,2007-03-30T02:58Z,"These cartoons are way better than the freaking movies. The Wolverine character here is a real badass, unlike the one in the movies who just isn't very convincing as a real hardcore mofo."
