Great film that starts in the middle age and then mostly filmed inside a 'CHURCH'. This gothic church with its mystery hidden paths and holes is cursed by being located on the remains of an early massacre and a crypt is being reopen which leads to some evil out which will attack the people who live/work/come there. 

Find a very young Asia Argento in the film as well (was this her first film?) 


Anyways, hope you'll enjoy this film!
