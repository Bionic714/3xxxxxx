,whatfun007,2007-03-29T02:43Z,This torrent has been up since January and hasn't even been downloaded yet. Talk about a slow moving torrent.

,nedgey,2007-05-04T13:11Z,"Awesome... fantastic joke. What a waste of time for everyone. >_>

Were you guys using the earlier version of protools? If so, would there really be much difference? I'm trying to change from cubase, but don't know if protools is worth it without the hardware that comes with it."
,stef555,2007-05-19T08:47Z,"99,6% -no Seeder & no Crack!!!"
,eggav,2007-05-23T01:55Z,You cant use ProTools whitout the hardware. Protools M-powerd works whit some M-audio hardware. You have to By ProTools

,djshapes,2007-07-18T09:20Z,"Hello,
I downloaded the torrent, I found the SN,
but it still doesn't work...
The instalation works great, but when I try to launch the application,
the icon bounces, but just stops bouncing, doesn't launch, and no error message...

I have an intel laptop mac, 10.4 osx System, and an Mbox...

Can somebody please help me, I'm lost !
And I can't work without pro tools !

Thanks for your help if someone knows an issue for me !?"
,davidpaul20,2007-07-18T18:19Z,Do you have to have an M-Audio interface to run this program.  I use Creative Emu 1616m....should this work??
,raiderr,2007-07-28T20:04Z,When i try to launch it says unable to locate hardware. Do i need some hardware to run this?
,squidbob,2007-08-04T12:03Z,Pt only works if you have digi hardware.... and will not work on all computers...certain mother boards and hard drives will not work.  Mac version won't work on pc ....pc version won't work on mac...HD wont work with LE.....LE won't work with HD.......
,joshbazz,2007-08-09T03:35Z,"""djshapes
...the icon bounces, but just stops bouncing, doesn't launch, and no error message....""
The issue is with mac OSX update. There is another option, other than automatic updates from apple that you can choose. Use that alternate option (I can't remember what it's called) and protools will work. You can search digidesign.com for more detailed info. I did and got the mac I was using working."
,squidbob,2007-08-30T02:07Z,The torrent says its the windows version...will not work on mac
,wagz0216,2007-09-28T00:59Z,does this work w/o digidesign hardware? im guessin it doesnt? im downloading just for fun right now. im at 40%
,kmach1ne,2008-10-08T21:06Z,"In order to use any pro tools program, you must have a interface that is compatible. M-audio is the leader in pro tools compatibality. If you have anything else, this program will not work. Period. Try Sonar or cubase"
,jhedgessd,2008-10-16T20:25Z,"can someone just make it so it is an image we can read on PC?  That dmg2iso shit is too confusing.  

It would be super cool if someone could hook up a nice copy of PT LE for everyone.  I bought stupid pro tools but the old discs don't work and I have to download it each time my comp crashes.

Cheers yo"
