,Tri_Motor,2007-01-12T04:12Z,"Hi guys... thanks for the upload... does this include the airshow?.... or is this just the airport?

Tri_Motor"
,4X-AXG,2007-01-12T12:28Z,"lol yes but that was me announcing that the W.A.R. Polar Air Cargo DVD is being posted in a.b.mm..but that has nothing to do with this scenery..that's why I was confused about your message 'got if off the newsgroups yesterday'

oh and TriMotor, it's both the airport and the airshow scenery, during installation you either select airport only or airport and airshow scenery both"
,neslesman,2007-01-12T23:24Z,"The air show is cool, too bad all those people there seem to be in suspended animation.
Nice scenery though,much appreciated."

,tickedOFflyer,2007-04-23T23:05Z,"Thanks, thieves....... I'm the co-author of VF Farnborough, and I can't express how upset I am to see you little scumbags nicking the hard work we put into making it.  Six months that took us, with lots of love and heartache going into it..... 
After many years trying to get a job and earn an honest wage, since being crippled in a motorbike accident, I thought I had found a career from which I may earn a crust. 

Well thge sales haven't been good, despite the product's overall quality, and now thanks to you lot I may be singing for my supper again.  How much do you think we've made??  Thousands? Tens of thousands of pounds??  No it's ihe hundreds.  Search your souls and tell me if that's enough to live off.

After this dismall performance in sales I may have to give up my modelling career and find something that you tosspots can't steal.

I realise most of you are gonna stick two fingers up at me, and laugh at how you've succeeded where I have failed, and upsetting though that is, I shall not give you the pleasure of revelling in my dissapointment.

But I ask..... if any of you have downloaded the scenery and you like it, please please buy it, and all will be forgiven.  I wuold even be happy to take personal requests should you pay for Farnborough, wether it be your house or a local airfield.  You'll find us developers extremely accomadating should you play ball.

But I gotta tell you..... I'm this close to jacking it all in...... no more addons from me, freeware or otherwise.  If I find out another of my addons are being shared illegaly I'm throwing in the towel and seeking another line of work.

See file sharing does hurt us developers, not just the big-boys who can afford lawyers to be sneered at and mocked by this site's delightful administration.  But us poor schmo's trying to earn at least a little bit to keep the roof over head.  

I'm prepared for the backlash you lot are about to give me, but just think, listen to your conciounce for a few seconds...... think, would my Mum be proud of me, knowing I'm denying a budding developer a living?

I'm absolutely gutted to have to say all this.  I hope some of you see sense.  "
,tickedOFflyer,2007-04-23T23:16Z,"Oh, and due to lack of funds there will not be an FSX convrsion for Farnborough now, despite it being so nearly ready for release.

Another success for the thieving pirate community, one less thing to download i suppose.

Very much I ask... :) 

Seed please :):)"
,HASTYN,2008-01-25T23:47Z,"Has loaded :)
Many thanks! :)

Excellent scenery!!"
,cheesynoob,2008-07-12T01:54Z,"to tickedoffflyer, its a shite add on anyway, not even worth stealing.."
[T],stevekasian,2008-10-27T21:06Z,"tickedOFflyer: You know, if you weren't so fucking lazy as to expect 1 single add-on that you worked on for 6 months to provide your entire livelihood, I'd feel for you. But since you're such a douche in that regard, I'll have to seed this :-). lol

p.s. I've had this scenery on my hard drive for almost 2 years and I've never once installed it. Not interested. Looks kind of annoying.

One thing you need to keep in mind is that of every 100 people who download this add-on for free, you've lost maybe a couple of sales. In other words, you want WAY too frikking much for your 1s and 0s and few people are willing to shell it out, regardless of whether they can get it for free or not."
,wazz62,2010-01-26T10:17Z,Please seed!!!
