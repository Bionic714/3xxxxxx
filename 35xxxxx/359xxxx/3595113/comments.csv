,Tornado,2007-01-20T14:32Z,Thanks a lot! This a true classic! One of the first music videos I ever bought back in 1984 I believe. Still have that tape (including the big-size original box) in mint condition. This is truly a very nice concert!

,STGstylah,2007-03-01T23:07Z,A real classic! Thanks for the up.
,niksumatsu,2007-04-22T10:25Z,the quality is not the best but you cant get this concert anywhere with a good quality. but you can see how great and amazing was AC/DC:s show in the 1979!!! i want to download more bon scotts concerts!! thanks very much of that!!!
,Formula Firebird,2007-05-06T01:16Z,"Correct. It's was only sold in VHS format and the dvd ""let there be rock"" by a piratcompany called ""Falcon Neue Medien"" found on E-bay is just a heep of crap compared to this rip. I bought this dvd myself and there is nothing orig on this dvd, all of it is taken from TV-broadcast. I have e-mailed AC-DC fan-club ""Down There"" and requested a DVD from the mastertape of this consert. But no reply... Fuckers."
,Formula Firebird,2008-03-29T22:46Z,"Hey! Still going after one year....
Nice! How about mailing AC-DC and asking them to produce a DVD of this consert. Money is not any issue.
To all Blues-Rocker:  Free - Fire and Water 1971 Fantastic Album! 
Paul Kossoff is known to had an huge influence on Angus Young's guitarplay.
Free is best known for the hit All Right Now
Cheers!"
,acdcbootlegs,2008-10-07T16:27Z,"I cant wait to see this concert again.  

I have been waiting for a DVD release, but it appears that the master film has degraded to the point that it will never be released.

If anyone knows where i can buy a 35mm Reel of this movie (aka for use in movie theater), please email acdcbootlegs@yahoo.com
