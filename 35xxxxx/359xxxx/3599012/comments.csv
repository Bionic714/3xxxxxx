Nevertheless 320kbps is more than twice as much as you need for audiobooks imho..."
,netean,2008-05-02T23:07Z,"oh I dunno. 320kbps is terrific.. I regularly have to transcode to m4b for my ipod or amr for my mobile phone (N95)... The higher the quality to start, the better my transcode. 

so, for me: 320kbps is great.

thank you"
