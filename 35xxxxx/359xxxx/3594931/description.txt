Release Notes:

A Weekend in the City is the forthcoming Bloc Party
album with an expected release date of February 5,
2007. It is being produced by Jacknife Lee.

This album deals much more with normal day working
life than was addressed on Silent Alarm, drawing
themes from the 7 July 2005 London bombings,
immigration, drug abuse, Black British lifestyle,
homosexuality, and criticism of youth subculture.
The album has been mostly met with mixed reviews by
web-critics and fans alike, with the success of
Silent Alarm setting high expectations for the next
album.

The first single is "The Prayer", due for release
on January 29, 2007.

Two songs that have been played live but did not
make it onto the album are "England" (Formerly
"Blue Moon") and "We Were Lovers" (Formerly "Into
The Blue" and "Cells Shaped Like Stars"). There is
also a never-before-heard track proclaimed to be on
the single for "The Prayer," called "Version 2.0."

"Song for Clay (Disappear Here)" was originally
"Merge On The Freeway" (and is inspired by the
novel Less Than Zero by Bret Easton Ellis), "The
Prayer" was originally "A Prayer To The Lord, "On"
was originally "Wet," "Where Is Home?" was
originally "Machine" and "Perfect Teens, and "I
Still Remember" was originally "It Started In An
Afternoon."
