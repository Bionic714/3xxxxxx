,max11max,2007-01-09T23:28Z,"HOAX, this film was proved to be a hoax. But then it's quite a good hoax. Flairs were found to be dropped by the U.S.A.F and proved to be falling behind distant mountains. Still they made this film. The guy who said he was abducted failed a polygraph teat and then whole thing was discredited by the USAF who released info about the flairs they dropped on the same day.."
,backups,2007-01-09T23:37Z,is this real dvdrip or dvd screener?
,truthseekers,2007-01-11T06:29Z,There was much said about why the military explaination didnt hold up. If they were flares (spelt flares BTW hehe) then this doesn t explain why a solid object was reported by many of the witnesses who could not see through the black shape to the sky behind. If these were flares the sky would have been visible from falre to flare. Many other sighting were had that same night and on following days. The film however is not a FAKE it is a fictionalisation story based on those events which took place. 
,max11max,2007-01-11T11:56Z,"OK so I can't spell, I'm Chinese and English is my second language. The films based on nothing. No evidence, no pictures of the craft and as one in four americans have some sort of HQ recorder to hand there was only one poor quality video and several poor quality pictures. Don't believe the HYPE!. The film is still quite good but acting is a bit of a letdown.

,mongoose84,2007-01-12T15:11Z,This is a really bad movie
,dd_unlimited,2007-01-14T04:34Z,"truthseekers: the irony of you correcting someone else's spelling, immediately followed by the misspelling of the word ""spelled"", is shocking. don't quit your day job."
,bullvard,2007-01-15T08:18Z,Not the best movie but the quality was good and it was worth see
,dinkdink,2007-01-16T03:50Z,"Hello Max11max

I think you did a good job, especially with your writing considering this is your second language. English is my second language too but I had the opportunity to study in English from 8th grade on. 

Now coming to you TRUTHSEEKER. If you are going to point someones flaw in any language, please make sure you do not make any careless mistakes. You used the wrong word when you wrote back to Max11Max. It is not SPELT, the correct word you were looking for is SPELLED. Spelt (Triticum spelta) was an important wheat species in parts of Europe from the Bronze Age to medieval times. 

This concludes our lesson in English as well as being nice to each other. Just like there is really no reason to write this comment back to you, the comment you directed at max11max was not necessary. And I agree with dd_unlimited.

Lets just all get along."

,max11max,2007-01-17T00:05Z,"Hey DinkDink, thanks for the English pointer. I'll remember that one I'm sure. Perhaps I should write in Chinese and see how you all do,  Hmm, I wonder... 

Thanks again."

Spelt and spelled are both correct..

not true, there isn't even 1 dialogue where religion is even mentioned - cause i really hate that too.
anyway the movie is total crap/quality is fine.

btw the worst movies with christian propaganda I've ever seen - some by mistake - are Starship Troopers 3, 2012 Doomsday and 20 years after (2008)"
