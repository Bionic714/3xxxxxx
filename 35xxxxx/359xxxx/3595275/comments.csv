,sylianb,2007-01-13T15:12Z,Woot! Thanks a lot I've been waiting for this one =P
,incel,2007-01-13T15:17Z,"Its possible to just copy the big installfiles to a folder and install from there...instead of mount every cd. No problem to install now, but cant uppgrade account before they open on monday night. need to install the latest update 2.03 too."
,Rasmuskarlsson,2007-01-13T15:22Z,are this wow the crackade
,-enZon-,2007-01-13T15:33Z,do this work for me in EU...and can i play on blizzards server??
,jantjuhhh,2007-01-13T15:48Z,"is it possible to play it free? dont like paying for games....
on the normal WoW there where private server are they here to?"
,wikberget,2007-01-13T16:26Z,"-enZon-, yes it works on the EU servers, but only if you have a keyto upgrade your account.

jantjuhhh, I'm pretty sure that there will be private servers for TBC aswell, but you have to find em yourself."
,darling888,2007-01-13T16:29Z,Think this client will work with the US client? I'm hoping it does...
,wikberget,2007-01-13T16:34Z,"I think you can use it to access the US servers, but you need to change the server adress in one of the config files."
,jab2711,2007-01-13T17:08Z,looking for retail enUS if anyone comes across it =)
,Randomm,2007-01-13T20:32Z,"Pls help, How can i download this? "
,slay_god,2007-01-13T21:14Z,doesnt anyone have 100% ??? i really wants this game.... so seed plz
,mbhawk,2007-01-13T21:31Z,Can I instal this BC on US version of WoW?
,josh767,2007-01-13T22:10Z,Just wait for the enUS version if you in the USA. It will be out before Tuesday I'm sure.
,Deface.oi,2007-01-13T23:38Z,great! Will seed when done!
,mattsoutham,2007-01-14T00:42Z,"Seed offline atm it appears, highest is 29.1% :("
,wikberget,2007-01-14T01:26Z,I'm not offline :/
,Karokk,2007-01-14T01:36Z,"How did you manage to get a copy so early? Where did you preorder? :)

Personally I'm waiting for my order hopefully I get it on monday."
,jimmyczz,2007-01-14T01:43Z,"You are doing great, wikberget  :)

Hope this will save a lot of time while I wait for my key to arrive with my official copy."
,wikberget,2007-01-14T01:45Z,It helps to have a dad that owns a toyshop ;)
,Zulzul760,2007-01-14T02:36Z,ARe this Game Cracked to play Free?
,Rhythalia,2007-01-14T03:32Z,I think it might work if you have US realmlist for it. I tried it on old World of Warcraft before. It's worth trying if you can get the US realmlist.wtf from somewhere.
,spall11,2007-01-14T03:35Z,Anyone that managed to dl it fully? Is it for real? Looks like no seeders online...
,endlesshaze,2007-01-14T04:07Z,Seeder is offline and highest is 39.7% but mine is stuck at 39.4% and doesnt get higher :( get online wikberget :p
,lawl3r,2007-01-14T04:54Z,downloading at 250 kb/s..no seeds online wikberget we need you :))!!
,lawl3r,2007-01-14T07:16Z,"I'm dling this basically as a pre-load, so right when  I get the game I can play it."
,Dem123,2007-01-14T07:21Z,"Cider, it's useful to some, more so the private server people although I won't have the installation discs for atleast a week after release, however I should have the key on release (complicated). So if blizzard don't make it available elsewhere it sort of leaves me in a spot of bother.

It's really useful/helpful to me so thank you the wikberget. Hopefully we'll have another seeder soon to speed things up."
,Vesel,2007-01-14T07:30Z,"Plz  guys, when u finish DL game dont go offline... Couse here was 2 seeders & speed was much better.... Just w8 a bit (1-2h). We all need this disc's 
P.S. Wikberget thx a lot m8."
,spotted,2007-01-14T07:38Z,"I'm downloading this because the shop I bought the game from will e-mail me the key to play and ship me the box the same day, so it will take 2 - 3 days to get the box but I'll be able to play anyway. ;)
As other people told pls seed and let's hope this isn't the beta because this link http://www.gamersloot.net/download/WOWBurningCrusadeEurope.torrent points to a WOW directory more than 7 GB large.
So I dunno if this installer will produce suce a big directory or what."
,endlesshaze,2007-01-14T07:53Z,"Nope this is the installation cds iso files , the torrent you have is the whole wow + tbc installed files."
,spotted,2007-01-14T09:15Z,"Yeah, sorry I realized that after writing the comment.
Anyways, someone should seed because I'm stuck at 51,4%"
,Drabuna,2007-01-14T10:04Z,"http://www.gamersloot.net/download/WOWBurningCrusadeEurope.torrent 
this is teh installed and patched beta version. So dont spend your time for downloading.

Thnx wikberget for this oportunnity to download teh game...and please...WAKE UP!))"
,spotted,2007-01-14T10:14Z,"I had that link too and it's 7 GB large.
That link doesn't let you download the installation files but a directory containg the files already installed. I prefear to have the installation files. :)"
,spotted,2007-01-14T10:31Z,"OK, on #wowace we came to the conclusion that very likely beta works fine (the difference between retail and beta is the cinematic introduction).
So just install beta and patch to 2.0.4 and edit with notepad or any text editor the file realmlist.wtf to make it look like this in case it does not:
set realmlist eu.logon.worldofwarcraft.com

There's a newline in the end of the file (probably it rappresents the ""end of file"" so pay attention to it when you edit)."
,pafp,2007-01-14T10:33Z,"WTB seed online!! :< stuck at 58%.
"
,spotted,2007-01-14T10:37Z,"I'm stuck too, that's why we are discussing and betting if beta will work or not in the end as the one mentioned seams to be the only real difference and so all this download may not be worth the efforts. :P
Anyways, since there's a chance that beta won't work because of some ""checks"" or things like that keep on seeding. :)"
,elhana,2007-01-14T10:37Z,"looks like seed is online, just behind nat/firewall
crossing fingers to get it all before 16th :p"
,Karokk,2007-01-14T10:39Z,"Yeah I'm pretty sure he's online, I thought I was stuck at 40ish % before I went to bed but now I'm at 59%."
,daidza,2007-01-14T10:45Z,You know guys there's pretty good chance that this isn't BC at all
,elhana,2007-01-14T10:47Z,why would someone bother to seed it then? to make you angry?
,pafp,2007-01-14T10:57Z,"Looks like theres a seed online, slow but downloading atm, i really hope it works on enUS wow."
,mattsoutham,2007-01-14T10:57Z,"is wikberget offline, or is my utorrent bugged again? Availability says 61.3, highest atm is about 60.8%"
,Karokk,2007-01-14T10:59Z,"Well I'm no expert on torrents but if Wikberget isn't in your swarm, availability=as much as wikberget has uploaded total. "
,pafp,2007-01-14T11:28Z,"Well it says...

Seeders:
2
Leechers:
334

If someone already finished this DL pls post here let us all know if is a fake or not, im still at 61%, slow DL ;/ "
,d_larsson,2007-01-14T11:35Z,Kan jag spela spelet vanligt men orginal wow. Jag har det...Eller måste man köpa  World of Warcraft Burning Crusade för att spela vanligt...
,pafp,2007-01-14T11:39Z,I have no idea what u just said.
,parasite,2007-01-14T11:51Z,"Its something about he has the original wow, and he wants to know if he can play the BC with that only if he downloads it, or has to buy it. sorry if im wrong, im not good in swedish :D

btw im at 63.3%, still downloading, but showing no seeds, only peers"
,pafp,2007-01-14T11:52Z,"same here, 63%"
,spotted,2007-01-14T11:54Z,"hey guys I just tried this myself.
I installed the beta inside a directory called ""Burning Crusade"" and I copied over that all the files contained inside the directory ""World of warcraft"" patched to the latest version (2.0.4 currently).
Then I got into the game and enjoyed the cinematic and started to play as usual. :)
So guys the one of the cds stated in the bluepost (the main reason many people are here to download) was to let us wait till the day 16.
So just do as I said, enjoy!"
,pafp,2007-01-14T11:54Z,Checking the peers looks like everyone is stuck on 63% :(
,pafp,2007-01-14T11:54Z,spotted seed pls !! i give u gold on bonechewer rofl
,pafp,2007-01-14T11:57Z,eh nvm i just readed with more attention
,spotted,2007-01-14T11:59Z,"You don't need to be seeded anything, just download the beta client from www.boomtown.net or from any other website which enables you to download it.
And do that simple thing. :P
Until the day 16 till we won't put in the cd key and the dark portal will be open we won't be allowed to do this:
- Entering in the outland;
- Levelling up and upgrading skills;
- Using equipment for lvl 61+ and so on.
But this will save time from the shipment which can be late and so you can start enjoy it immediately as the gate is open. :P"
,Randomm,2007-01-14T12:58Z,"So, is there a beta client? Or original?"
,jimmyczz,2007-01-14T13:05Z,"Seems we are back to 1 seeder again. :(

When I am complete I will seed for at least 12 hours as its only way to help speed up downloads for the rest. 

If you get to complete please stay connected to help others."
,spotted,2007-01-14T13:47Z,"This should be retail, but I'm telling you that very likely it will work with beta as well."
,endlesshaze,2007-01-14T13:49Z,"meh a lot people seems to be stuck on 69.7% now, i hope it continues to download :"
,parasite,2007-01-14T13:52Z,stopped at 69.7%

Just hope it completes asap :p 

Does anyone have a link to somewhere I can just by the CD Key? mail me: mattsoutham at gmail dot com"
,wikberget,2007-01-14T14:21Z,"pafp, I'm still here"
,pafp,2007-01-14T14:24Z,why is it showing no seed if ur online ? :O (1st time i use torrents btw)
,wikberget,2007-01-14T14:35Z,"I dont think you are in my swarm, that is the reason you wont see me..."
,pafp,2007-01-14T14:38Z,oic ..o.o d'oh
,mattsoutham,2007-01-14T14:39Z,"Should be finished some time tonight I imagine, I will keep seeding throughout the first few days of release. I don't understand why Blizzard didn't do this anyway, everyone has to buy a CD Key to play."
,Karokk,2007-01-14T14:50Z,"Nah I think it's jsut bugged I mean wikberget has confirmed that he is still online so like you said, don't worry :)"

,cowhunting,2007-01-14T17:04Z,"Does anyone know when you have to put in the CD key. is it before or after installing it.

my reason for downloading was to install it, go pick up the game at midnight and then just enter they key and start playing, but if it asks for the key at the start then my plan is kind of screwed"
,OldMonah,2007-01-14T17:09Z,U must use key only to upgrade your wow account at account management. To install TBC u must not enter cd-key.

in the picture the size on the left side of the pic is 519.497 bytes, while the torrent lists the cd1 with 665,077,760 bytes

,livefree76,2007-01-14T21:30Z,"elhana is right, the game itself will most likely ship as WoW version 2.0.0 and have to be patched up to 2.0.4 (or 2.0.5 if they launch another patch the same day tbc goes live). These games have been in the process of being made, packaged and ready to ship for well over a month or more. This is why they have patches, and continued the beta testing up till the end. So when the game does ship they can have a patch out that will hopefully fix all the bugs that shipped with the version of the game in the box. And add in new updates, changes that came about from the continued beta testing."
,livefree76,2007-01-14T21:32Z,another note.. you really think they shipped the game to the stores with version 2.0.3 or 2.0.4? that makes me laugh.. lol

When you get your key, just upgrade your acc and start playing, It will save some of your time. Other, I know many that only purchased e-maild key, cannt get Cds.

,yozhik,2007-01-15T00:32Z,"how to install:

1. copy ALL FOUR ""installer tome ?.mpq"" in one folder with installer(dont worry, they have different names). and maybe everything else from cd#1 too, but dunno, maybe its not needed either.
2. run installer.
3. run game, patch it (first 2.0.3, then 2.0.4), play it."

,catrix,2007-01-15T01:33Z,"@dponte the CDs are from the MAC Version, and there arent any exe files included"
,dponte,2007-01-15T01:34Z,Thanks catrix.. I didnt know they made different versions... I thought all versions were PC/MAC compatible. That clears it up :)
,wikberget,2007-01-15T01:39Z,"dponte, The CDs are divided in 2 parts a win part and an OS X part, they share the mpq files, and differ on the installer part, you shouldnt see the other OS part normaly... I didnt knew that before I had seeded the torrent for a while, so I had to put the CD in a windows comp and copy the win installer from it."

To be able to play WoWTBC i need to download this and window instaler. (Windows and Eu)

But do i have to have a WoW copy on my pc? If yes can i simply downloads it from here or is the copy that u get from a WoW trial account ok?

After that I have installed Wowtbc all i need to do is buy a 60 days card? 

btw how can i keep my WoW trial account character on my TBC account? or is it possible to uppgrade the wow trial account to a TBC full account!? 
I would really appriciate a fast and clear answer ^^"

,elleez,2008-03-25T18:06Z,How do you install this?
,TheBoxNinja,2008-03-25T22:18Z,"ALRIGHT PEOPLE!

I'm not sure about the actual download but I can tell you this:

(1) You CANNOT play this on a real blizzard server, you have to play on a private one.
(2) You CANNOT just download this and by a 60-day card, you need a REAL copy and a REAL Cd-Key
(3) You CANNOT use a keygen, there isnt one that will work, so stop asking. Blizzard is too smart for that
(4) You CANNOT Play this without the Original World of Warcraft
(5) You CANNOT have a REAL World of Warcraft paid account and upgrade that REAL account using this. You need a Cd-key from a REAL copy of Burning Crusade

~ All this is good for is playing on private servers~"
,Enemy04,2008-04-15T00:41Z,"anyway guys the private servers, u can find some that are the same as real wow...
So some private servers have up to 5000 people.
So google and type ""wow private servers"" and find a way to play on the sites and look.
 thats true Blizzard are geniuses they wont fall for reusable accs, serial, etc 

It aint worth it burning crusade is $30 and normal is $20 with $15 a month...lol so do not complain about the connection its hard to get so please i ask for more seeding cause i will seed for a while."
,apaolle1,2008-04-21T16:54Z,"You need to have the orginal World of warcraft installed before you install this expansion, to install this expansion you need a program like daemon tool to mount the CD1 with, and during the installation you mount CD2, CD3 and so on when the installation tells you to change CD.
AND this is important: you can play on both private servers AND blizzard servers, but on blizzard server you need to create and pay for an account.. 
To change from private servers to blizzard/blizzard to private you need to change the ""realmlist"" from the currect private/blizzard server. Open ""realmlist"" in world of warcraft folder with notepad. And type in the realmlist from the private/blizzard server. Here is the EU realmlist from the real blizzard servers --->  set realmlist eu.logon.worldofwarcraft.com
set patchlist eu.version.worldofwarcraft.com  "
,apaolle1,2008-04-21T17:06Z,"To play on private servers you need to visit private servers website and create an accont there for free. You need to find their private server realmlist on website to copy and paste in the ""realmlist"" in the world of warcraft folder. When you paste it in you need to delete the text what is allready in and after save. And when everything of this is done, start the game, write in the accont name and password you created on the private server website and you are in :)
