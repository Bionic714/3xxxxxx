,T-Wolf,2010-12-14T01:22Z,"I own this album but the song 'Guardian Angel' is not on it, rather there is an exact musical sounding song (different lyrics only, exact same music), which I can remember getting tons of radio play years ago called ""East of Eden"", that is what is on it instead and the name of the album is not 'Nino' but ""East of Eden"".  I have heard the song 'Guardian Angel' and frankly I prefer ""East of Eden"" to it any day.  It was a quirky song but I have fond memories of it just the same."
