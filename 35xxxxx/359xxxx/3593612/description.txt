A FREDRIKSAM VINYLRIP  Presents: Nino De Angelo - Nino

This is a really great record from 1984. The most famous song must be "guardian Angel". One year later a group named Masquerade did a cover of this song, but this is the original on this record.

This is a vinyl rip with all defects as flutter, scraps and such still left, but its not very much "noise" so its ok.

Bitrate is 128 kb. Front and back cover also included.
