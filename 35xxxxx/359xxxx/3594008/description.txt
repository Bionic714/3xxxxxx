This is Story of a Junkie. It follows a junkie, named Gringo, and his travels through the NYC he
roin/drug scene in the 80s. This film is halfway a story, and halfway a documentary. The documentary part is the good bit, whatever story this movie has is halfassed. Note that this is pretty hardcore, as all of the 'actors' are/were real junkies. All the needles and drugs are real, nothing is a prop. This is worth watching, despite what IMDB claims. Good luck, and I hope you all help me seed because I am trying to pump as many unique/cool DVDRips on this site as fast as I can, which leaves me having to jump off my torrents after a week or so.

By the by, here's a nice graphical list of all my DVDs. If I get any requests I think are good, or if enough people ask for something, I'll torrent it. So hey, post away! http://bradp.co.uk/fredryk/dvds/
