This a guide to modifying your 360 drive to play backup games. Every thing u need is included. 

Simply boot using slax to force your drive into modeB, then use 360 firmware toolbox to modify and flash your drive, Even the nasty v78\'s. 

(no bricked drives due to crossed wire trick or bad flashing ) 

Hope this helps ppl who cant use mtkflash and similar programs due to chipset incompatibility
