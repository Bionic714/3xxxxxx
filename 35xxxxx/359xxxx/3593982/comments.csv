Found out you can't just use a flash for every XBox..
Depends on the brand of the drive..
I ""janked"" off the front of my XBox,and you can see trough a hole what color the wire that connects the drive to the box is..
If it's white..you're lucky!..if it's yellow then you HAVE TO REPLACE THE DRIVE!!then you have the Philips one-lite version,and somehow you can't completely flash that..

So check what brand of drive you have!before flashing..

Also be aware of Microsoft..they can see through LIVE if you are playing a backup game,and do something to your firmware
(if you installed the flash,and forgot something)

So take care of the fact that Microsoft NEVER sees you're playing a backup with a modded console..

Last but not least..you MIGHT EVEN lose you're link with LIVE after modding..

So be VERRY CAREFULL..

I have the posibility to let someone modd my XBox at my house,for ?30,-..and I had the Philips drive with yellow wire,so i get an other drive installed,and get to keep the old!!

But I only have it for a day..so I'll have to digg in a little more..  ;)
