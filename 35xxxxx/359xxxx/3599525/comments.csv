,marbreu,2007-08-05T00:40Z,thanks is very good
,ilive4harleys,2007-09-02T10:50Z,"Krav Maga..Israeli Army Commando Self Defense. The stuff really works. The best in street defense as well. Absolutely well worth the download. I shall keep the seed going for as long as I possibly can so everyone grab it. It is worth the large DL. While everyone who takes martial arts believes there style or form is the best, this is not really a martial art. This is down and dirty self defense. And this is, IMNSHO, far the best for basic street survival as well as Army and Marine training.
Enjoy y'all!"
,silverwolf969,2008-03-06T22:30Z,"this is an awesome fighting style, i've seen it demonstrated and studied a few times and all i can say is that is has no mercy, it is a style based on you winning and the other losing. if you're looking for some pretty moves with spinning and grace try something like judo. but as far as kicking ass and taking names goes, there's no substitute for this stuff. just gotta watch it a couple times and i'll need a new punching bag."

,Pheaton79,2010-02-05T22:45Z,"Thank you very much =D! DrHofman, is the guy who stumbled upon LSD-25, (fun fact). So thanks to both of you i guess."
,fgherger,2011-02-16T17:44Z,"I thought Krav Maga was a kind of martial art, but it turns out that you can't practice it without impairing your opponents reproducion capacity. Almost all moves target the crotch. For women it's very valid, since men are phisically stronger they need to explore vulnerabilities. But for a guy? We now how much this hurts. Anyway, thanks for the video, very informative."
,azitromax,2011-03-05T16:01Z,Thanx DRHofmann
,DrHofmann,2011-09-27T00:28Z,"Glad to help everyone!! :-)
