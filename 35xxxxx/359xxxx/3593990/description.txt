  This documentary series about military weaponry begins by tracing the 
  evolution of the machine gun, from its invention by Dr Richard Jordan 
  Gatling during the American Civil War to the formidable GAU-8 model used
  today. An early version is put to the test, and also examined are the 
  famous 'Tommy gun' developed by Colonel John Thompson and the M-16 assault
  rifle used by US forces in Vietnam.
