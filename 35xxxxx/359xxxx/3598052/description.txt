Once you've obtained A+ certification to show you know computer basics, the natural progression in the IT career path is to learn networking and certify your knowledge with Network+. This makes current and future employers confident that you can be an integral part of developing and maintaining their business computer network. An individual certified as a Network+ technician has proven him or herself to be fundamentally competent; has proven a solid base of knowledge and expertise in networking technologies.

The 2005 Network+ Series builds on the quality instruction delivered in the A+ certification series. It covers all the networking knowledge crucial to Network+ certification standards, including the 2005 update to the Network+ certification exams. CompTIA designed this updated exam to ensure that you have the real world ability to work in the networking environments in use today and planned for tomorrow. Some of these important updates include wireless networking, gigabit Ethernet, and improved security practices.
