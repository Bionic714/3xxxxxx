,Olive74,2007-01-14T06:25Z,Multilanguage or english version ? THX
,mikethejones,2007-01-14T08:07Z,"   I found a French and a German project folder (one of each) contained inside the app, but it doesn't appear to be multilingual.  I don't see any way to change the language preference.  However, the Read Me in the dmg does refer to a Voice Recognition feature available only on the Mac version.  It refers to further instructions to activate the feature."
,dtearth7542,2007-01-15T01:03Z,Why is it that I can only get 84 seeders with only 9.2% of the game. Come on people. Lets seed here. I know I do. 
,justjeper,2007-01-15T20:54Z,"Stuck, please seed... PLEASE...please"
,Only_mac,2007-01-15T21:59Z,seed guys please
,mikethejones,2007-01-15T22:54Z,"   This is exactly why I stopped uploading here before.  Everyone wants to download all the great programs and such here at the Bay, but no one wants to be responsible enough to share it back out.  Remember, sharing is not just the responsibility of the Seeder.  Leechers have to allow their clients to share out unfinished files, too, as a lot of the information in the swarm comes from Leechers, too.  I, personally, will still seed files that I've downloaded that don't work for me, but I also comment on how well it worked (or didn't work) for me so others are better prepared before THEY download.  If we don't share, the whole system stops working right.  Don't let the torrents die.  Sharing is caring."
,Seborion,2007-01-16T12:29Z,"Dear mikethejones, I've been uploading for a long time. So guys do, some guys don't. Please don't just tease me with 9.3%! I am eager to get hold of the game and would appreciate very much if u kept uploading. Regards"
,Dizzim,2007-01-16T16:48Z,"Hi guys, we're ALOT of people waiting for this file. Can you please seed?
 - Thanks."
,mikethejones,2007-01-16T20:10Z,"  I haven't stopped seeding.  What I'm trying to say is, everyone has to be patient and they have to be willing to share while downloading. This makes the file download faster for everyone.  "
,justjeper,2007-01-17T05:50Z,"I will Promise to seed this but I only have 16 %

Please seed"
,justjeper,2007-01-18T20:53Z,"Hi Mike Jones. I have 50 % now. And don't worry, I will keep seeding this.
Thank you for this"
,justjeper,2007-01-19T03:26Z,"56 % and uploading faster then downloading.

So keep up the good work MikeTheJones"
,justjeper,2007-01-19T13:19Z,74 % and counting. Almost there. Keep it going for a few.
,Recalgon,2007-01-19T21:57Z,"I seed at 40kbs, plz seed more.."
,napiermac,2007-01-20T01:39Z,Stuck on 99.4%
,mikethejones,2007-01-20T01:59Z,"   Merry Christmas!  Someone out there has figured out how to corrupt this file (They deleted or altered the first and third blocks of the file) but I tested it at 99.7 and didn't see any problems.  As near as I can tell, they corrupted one of the two pdf files inside the dmg. Nice try, but the dmg DOES mount, and, with the crack I already uploaded, it works great."
,Dizzim,2007-01-20T03:01Z,"@mikethejones: So there is no reason to keep downloading the file when you're at 99,8% ?
You kan just mount it with toast and run it as you would normally?"
,mikethejones,2007-01-20T03:14Z,"    No, you need the crack.  I am going to seed the crack again, just in case no one else is."
,mikethejones,2007-01-20T03:18Z,"    But, other than that, yes, you are done."
,napiermac,2007-01-20T03:25Z,"Excuse my ignorance, but if my client is showing 99.8%, how do I complete the download in order to seed?"
,mikethejones,2007-01-20T03:44Z,"  Whoever it was that corrupted the file arranged that that there be no REAL seeds. I suggest that you just share until 1.000 or better ( hopefully, better) Or as long as we all can.  This is an extenuating circumstance, and seeding does not necessarily appy."
,mikethejones,2007-01-20T04:13Z,Apply. Sorry.
,anti_ewe,2007-01-20T04:22Z,"I'm at 99.8% and tried to mount the image using toast. I got ""no mountable file systems."" Any suggestions?"
,Dagenham Dave,2007-01-20T09:37Z,"I'm stuck on 99,8% and I have a ratio of 2.545. So please, whoever has 100% seed."
,lc5,2007-01-20T10:47Z,"IÂ´m at 99.8% also. Its not possible to mount the image file, and burning it to a DVD results in a unusable disc. Doesnt anyone have the unaltered original file?"
,ThomAlexander,2007-01-20T11:47Z,I am at 98 %. Can someone tell me exactly what to do now to make it work?
,napiermac,2007-01-20T11:50Z,I think this is a dead duck :-(
,ThomAlexander,2007-01-20T11:50Z,And everybody keeps talking about the dmg... I only have a toast file.. sorry if im a noob..
,lc5,2007-01-20T12:15Z,".toast is a image file used by toast only. A DMG is apples standard disc image format.... and yes, there is no point in downloading/seeding this file further. Its corrupted and need to be replaced by a complete image file."
,pzmx,2007-01-20T12:24Z,Downloaded 0 times...and all (including me) stopped at 99.8%...is this a joke?
,mikethejones,2007-01-20T13:55Z,"http://www.mininova dot org/tor/540634


Had to write dot instead of inserting a period.

Stop my torrent and open this one into the same place as the old one.  This new one will fix the corrupted pieces in the dmg.  Also, it has lots of seeds. Remember, throw out the torrent, NOT THE DMG!"
,mikethejones,2007-01-20T15:54Z,"   If you can't download from the Demonoid tracker, I have posted a reseed."
,GOODBEEFYUM,2007-01-26T05:34Z,will someone please seed if you do you kick ass
,Only_mac,2007-01-26T14:10Z,why you can't seed WE ARE WAITING FOR YEARS THAT RELease so please SEEDER came on and seed only this 2Mb

,iamthewalrus1991,2008-02-01T07:26Z,"Hey guys, I know most of you are sitting tight. Mine is stuck on the last 10 megabytes. I wonder if there is anyway to contact the original seeder and get him to seed us for the last bit?"

** ATTENTION ** ! ! !

NO MORE CRACK NEEDED !!!!

Although i didnt download Age of Empires 3 for Mac from this particular torrent i got mine working with 2 simple steps.

Step 1: Install AOE3 and/or Expansions

Step 2: Update AOE3 to the latest patch (1.05) and then update the expansions to the latest patch. heres a link to all the patches
http://destineergames.com/support/?page_id=88

Its that easy!

Now Age of Empire 3 should even work online, no crack needed because the latest updates remove the cd check, just download Gameranger create a free account and your good to go.

Hope this helps. If you still cant get Age of Empires III to work then its because you failed to follow my simple steps.

See you on the battlefield! xD"
,hollylindin,2009-12-24T18:35Z,"Oh, my God, this torrent has been on 99% for two weeks!  Could you seed, please, just for a teensy-tiny bit?

Have a great holiday, everybody!  I hope your holiday is filled with love, happiness, laughter, and many wonderful memories!
