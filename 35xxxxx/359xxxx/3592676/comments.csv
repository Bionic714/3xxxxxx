,Sumerah,2007-01-09T03:29Z,Thanks for rarring it. I'm not going to download 8gb when I only want 3 games.
,spelgubbe,2007-01-09T03:33Z,"Haha yeah I can see the problem, but 2800 files inside a torrent is just messy... if you're after three games, I'm pretty sure you can find it from some abandonware site."
,happy-porcupine,2007-01-09T05:49Z,"anyone ever come across a collection of original floppy images of DOS games?  possibly on emule, just wish I could remember the filename"
,happy-porcupine,2007-01-09T05:57Z,BTW like the inclusion of developer and year in the file naming.  but is it safe to assume that NOT every game was checked?
,spelgubbe,2007-01-09T06:20Z,Checked for what?
,happy-porcupine,2007-01-09T06:50Z,"That each game is what it's supposed to be, that it runs, that files aren't missing, that junk hasn't been added.   But forget it, just realized that I missed the ""Eggmans Emulation Archive"" part of your comment...  "
,Silwerwing,2007-01-09T13:01Z,"Look here for some abandonware:

,Puscus,2007-01-09T19:55Z,Thank you very much for all these games of old... Send me back to my young days!
,cyber_axe,2007-01-10T11:54Z,"for abandonware i goto www.dosgamezone.com. HTTP Downloads, and you can request many games."
,happy-porcupine,2007-01-11T07:48Z,"As advertised; just classic games without junk added to each archive, consistent, clean, and no passwords.  Recommended."
,Hawk-McKain,2007-01-14T01:46Z,"Jeeze, this is amazing, and has some games I couldn't find anywhere! ~thunbs up~

However, I do have a problem having to download 8gb before I can get to any of the files. So while I do see why you can't upload them individually, maybe you should group them by letter or put them into 3 parts or something.

Because the problem I have with .rars like this is the fact I don't want to take up 8gb harddrive space to be able to seed. I would love to seed, but I just can't do it like this."
,spelgubbe,2007-01-14T04:33Z,"Hehe, seriously, I'm not going to repack this. Just get it while there are seeders, and if you can't keep on seeding, then don't. Just play your games and have fun :)"
,sobient,2007-01-14T11:01Z,or you could try www.dosspirit.net for abandonware
,Ran4,2007-01-14T13:08Z,"omg... YOU STUPID FUCKING IDIOT! HOW CAN YOU BE SO EXTREMELY RETARDED THAT YOU FORCE PEOPLE TO DOWNLOAD 8GB FOR SOME GAMES BY PUTTING IT ALL IN A TOTALLY STUPID RAR-CONTAINER, AND TO SHOW YOUR STUPIDITY, EVEN IN MULTIPLE RAR CONTAINERS! YOU-ARE-STUPID"
,camouflage_81_,2007-01-14T15:52Z,Ran4. Get your games elsewhere if this isn't what you like =)
,CoenV,2007-01-14T16:58Z,Sick torrent! Thanks!
,kokopiko,2007-01-14T19:43Z,You don`t have to download it. You can just download one or few of those games from any abandonware sites.
,spelgubbe,2007-01-15T03:16Z,"Hehe, someone needs a chillpill :) I've already tried uploading torrents with 3000+ files inside, and believe me, people still complain. ""OMG U STUPID F*CK, TOO MANY FILES, YOU CANT PUT OVER 3000 FILES INSIDE A TORRENT U RETARD"". And about multiple rarfiles, ehh - Single rar, or multiple rars, can someone enlighten me what the problem is? And yeah, get your single games from abandonware sites, consider this a collectors item."

,spelgubbe,2007-01-23T02:30Z,"I have stated very clearly above in my notes that some of the games contains viruses. Read, jerk."

,spelgubbe,2007-01-24T17:38Z,"I know some people dont like the thought of downloading 8 gb, but maybe someone else could create another torrent out of this torrent. In a week I will stop seeding this, due to a reformat of drives. I've uploaded 1000 gb and currently there are 507 leechers."
,HaNieL,2007-01-25T01:02Z,"Ja, jättebra!!"
,pikachu5501,2007-01-25T15:09Z,"Wow, that a good collection. Most of thoses that i brought, floppies dont work anymore and i paid almost 60$ for most of them.  Can't wait to play ultima Underworld again on a my dusty old Pentium 1 that i just took out of the closet that i was keeping just in case. :p

jerks and whiners:
i did a scan myself and so far, my AVG has detected some as unknown viruses. The thing is in thoses times, tsr (residents that work in background) where needed to run some games or trainers the same way virus did. If you still dont feel safe about it, you may want to find an older version of SCAN/CLEAN and do it within DOS or in dosbox if you using windows. 

THanx spelgubbe and all seeders.

,robbydobby,2007-01-26T19:44Z,"some of the games arent working. Duke Nukem 2 and Bio Menace will play the first level and then it says a file is missing. where can i get the file?

and I cant get Duke 3D to work at all. i dont know whats wrong. Help, Spelgubbe?

and is it just me, or are of the rar files the same thing?

,buzzcramp,2007-02-10T08:25Z,just wanted to add... i know this is an unusually large file to u/l and d/l. big thanks to everyone that's completed the d/l and is continuing to seed... that's very cool of you and i for one appreciate the hell out of it. 
,spelgubbe,2007-02-12T23:15Z,"Phybre, you haven't downloaded and ran an A/V scan on this pack huh? This pack is not full of viruses. If you're still using Windows 3.1 and dont quite know what you're doing, then maybe you shouldn't get this torrent since there's a 1% risk you will get an ascii ambulance passing by your monitor :)"
,Larry Laffer,2007-02-13T07:22Z,"So many games I've been looking for... great job spelgubbe!


@those that think the torrent's full of viruses: For god's sake, even a FREE av software can detect and fix those 2(two) infected files that might be found, but I didn't find anything yet :P"
,Bevesocth,2007-02-13T09:41Z,"Totally awesome stuff, this looks like it will be hours and hours of fun for me & the missus :)

Appreciate your efforts spelgubbe, thanks a bunch :)"
,spelgubbe,2007-02-14T04:59Z,"Alright, thanks for all your comments! Let's hope people keep on seeding this for a while, cause the harddrive that held this torrent has crashed and I couldn't recover some data. I do still have the games on dvd's, though the probability that I will reupload is slim, so get it while you can :)"

,notflapjack,2007-02-20T03:05Z,"i like Bevesocth's idea. separating game rars by letters. i just want Destruction Derby 2, but i can't get just it, because it's all one rar."

,Panodilo,2007-02-21T21:14Z,"lol - you have a problem, wazaw, but it isn't with English grammar. It's entirely psychological. You're probably not getting enough recognition from friends and family. You attempt to compensate for this by typing gramatically correct sentences on the net and then give yourself a hard time, hoping somebody will jump in and say, ""Don't be silly, wazaw. Your English is excellent!"" Silly little man - lol"

What makes all you little whiners think that your pathetic little cases of not wanting to download something has any interest to anyone? You want to hear about all the things I don't want to do? You think anyone is interested in hearing from the 6 billion other people who are also not going to download this for all sorts of reasons like not having enough pennies for a bowl of rice to even consider buying a modem? Why would your stupid little lives with stupid little complaints have any relevance to this torrent? Just shut the fuck up and download something else, like the complete Teletubbies series or whatever gets you faggots rolling.

spelgubbe, thanks for this fantastic torrent. It's exactly like it should be, all rar'ed up and ready to redistribute. And the viruses are just icing on the cake in all their added nostalgic value - I, for instance, love the sound of the Lamer Exterminator killing off an Amiga floppy, even if the sound is  emulated, so the prospect of seeing DOS suffer from something equally funny is thrilling, too :)

Thanks, man. Bang up job. Nothing more  to say."
,KnuxTheFox,2007-05-24T15:45Z,"It IS an impressive list!  The only reason I started downloading this is for the old DOS version of Inherit The Earth: The Quest For The Orb, so that I can run it on ScummVM, which if you don't already know is a Virtual Machine (or emulator if you wanna call it that) of the original game engine made for Maniac Mansion and used for many others.  The ScummVM virtual machine is currently available on more platforms than you could shake a stick at...  From Amiga and Atari computers to PS2, PSP, Dreamcast and GP2X!

when i was a child i enjoyed playin commander keen at my grandparents and we owned doom2 for windows 95 but we didnt have any expansions or anything but anyway this torrent largely disappointed me i havent had much experence with dos so i spent the last week downloading all 8gbs of this torrent for a few old fasion games then i downloaded dos box and spent like 2hours figuring out all the mounting shit ect. then i started doom 2 to see f it was alot like the one for windows 95... it frooze 5secs in... i tryed other games and all i got was low quality head aches...

unless u are ubsessed with old games and low quality headaches i wouldnt bother..."

I just wanted to say thank you for taking the time and energy into putting up this great collection.  Also, does anyone have a text file with a complete list of all the games included?  I'd like to be able to give something small to my friends who could then pick out some games from it instead of burning the entire volume for them! ;-)  thanks again! i'll seed this one for another week or so!"
,andrisv1982,2007-07-22T11:12Z,"Fantastic collection!!! Actually I already downloaded all games I wanted, but still it is good to have the whole list at home!

Then concerning DOSbox, yeah I think some people can have trouble with it, but if you don't want to now all shit about configuration I came with solution for that:

Just make one shortcut to dosbox with this kind of structure for target destination (this is example for CIVILIZATION):
""C:\Program Files\DOSBox-0.65\DOSBox.exe"" -c ""mount c D:\dos-games\Civ"" -c c: -c civ.exe

But of course you have to modify it according to specific game you want to play (you have to show location of game and the lunching file)

Great upload!! Could somebody please upload Fifa 97. I can't find it any where on the internet!
Thanks' alot""

Not sure if a torrent has been posted here,  but if you're still looking for FIFA 97, you could try this link:

http://www.classic-gaming.net/game/376/

They have an ass-load of stuff, and it's listed as abandonware. Happy hunting!"
,subsist,2007-08-19T09:00Z,Lots of good stuff! Too bad that I'm in fucking Australia atm.. their internett sucks bigtime..so i have this bandwith limit.. But i will download this when i get back to norway for sure!
,robowarriorx,2007-08-20T06:17Z,"Just curious, and not complaining, found three viruses in Cannon Fodder (94), F40 Interceptor Ega, and Yo Joe. I've tried to get rid of them, but Avast seems to have a problem moving them to quarantine..anyone know why? Not TOO terribly worried about it though, as there are many many games here I was looking for, and the viruses are a worm and 2 trojan horses. Says the worm is PS/MPC-gen3, couldn't find any info about it on google, probably because its ancient! But at any rate, this is greatly appreciated, as there are so many games both my wife and I want to play, and only 3 viruses out of so many files isnt that bad really, pretty damn good! So, thanks for sharing this awesome collection!"
,pena_h,2007-08-21T16:51Z,Is there any chance to get full list of the games?
,spelgubbe,2007-08-22T14:25Z,"Yeah, it's in the first comment of this torrent. Here goes: www.speedyshare.com/392826862.html"

,ursak,2007-09-02T13:33Z,Hmmm... The viruses is no problem since they don't run on WinXP? Well... That makes it a prob for me then since I have an 486 to run these on.. Damn!

,adcurtin,2007-09-26T05:49Z,"Uploader you suck. I want just one game in this collection, and I probably won'tfind it anywhere else, but isnce you uploaded this as one giant archive, I get to download 8 FUCKING GB of data just to get the one game (which is not more than 1.5MB) how retarded is that? RAR files do not belong in torrents. If it decreases the size significantly, put everything is seperate rar files. NEVER do one giant rar file."
,spelgubbe,2007-09-26T16:48Z,"So, you really think that every single game would still be seeded after almost 10 months (this is thepiratebay remember)? You don't think that almost everyone would've picked out specific games if I uploaded it your way? Don't bother answering, just eat a dick up."
,Cernunny,2007-09-30T12:26Z,"Actually you should have put them in their individual torrents, I live in NZ and have a download limit so I'd rather just pick out the games I wanted to play and ignore the rest. If I didn't have this limit I wouldn't care otherwise."
,Tiggerilla,2007-09-30T15:13Z,"Absolutely. Yummy. I'll seed once I'm done for a while, right now the speed is pretty low. I'll seed forever. GREAT upload! To all you complainers: weigh your priorities. My top priority is cheapness. Followed closely by how well the stuff works. Haha. This is awesome."

In case YOU don't know, i'ts pretty hard to determine wich of the 173 rar's that contain a certin game...

I will not DL, but thanks anyway for the UL!"
,1ncendiary,2008-02-03T21:49Z,"TO ALL THE ""I WANT *X* SPECIFIC GAME, YOU'RE STUPID FOR CLUMPING THEM ALL TOGETHER"" PEOPLE.

first: perhaps it would be a good idea to read the info blurb:
""I put them in a rar container because some torrentclients don't appreciate >1000 files""
having torrents with several thousand files inside DOES have the tendency to slow down the client software.. i know, it pisses me off no end (not to mention the increase in RAM usage for a client with that torrent open (ie azureus))

SECOND: consider these: 
- these games are abandonware. if people like spelgubbe didn't make collections such as these, the games would likely disappear into the mists of time. by preserving this entire download you are preserving a piece of history. 
- If you want to play one of them, you probably would recognize more of them that you might want to play.. games that you may not have remembered if you didn't have them in the archive.
- a torrent such as this (and especially with 97 seeders) tend to download quite quickly and is usually done within a few days, at which point you can very easily burn them to 2 DVDs
     - if that's too slow for you: stop whining
     - if your computer can't handle fast download    
     speeds: you either live in the country where 
     only dialup is available (in which case your 
     concerns are legitimate), or you should just 
     go out to your retailer and buy the game 
     since you clearly are living in the 90s.
     - you don't have 8 gb on your hard drive to 
     download to: same as above.. minus the 
     country part.. and you should sell your plans 
     for a time-machine and buy a better 
     computer!
     - you have some kind of moral objection to 
     spending between $1 - $2 on blank DVDs to \
     burn them to: you are too stubborn and 
     stupid to be allowed to be downloading.. go 
     outside and shoot yourself in the head for the 
     greater good of the gene pool.

- these comments are strangely absent from old video game ROMs torrents. (think about it)"

This collection is awsome! There are sooo many cool games...Doom, Duke Nukem, Commander Keen, Dynablaster, Aladdin, King's Quest, Legend of Kyrandia etc. etc. etc. ... You did a GREAT job and don't notice  all those miserable ***** who complain about everything since the moment they were born... If you want 2-3 games, there are A LOT of abandonware-sites where you can find them...For sure.

So many hours spent cutting class, talking to my boyfriend on the phone, listening to Taylor Dayne (""Tell it to my heart""), and playing Gato on a Hercules graphics card running a TSR emulating CGI on a clone ""turbo"" PC-XT (8mhz overclocked to 12mhz, baby!)...

,HIyaalll,2008-06-15T13:28Z,"to ajaybc: Some of these games are free to share as the original copyrightholder either by own choise made them public domain or simply because they won't bother about filing complaints about software this old, as they have no intention making money from it themself anymore... BUT this is NOT true for everything in this pack. For example SIERRA have recently started reselling bundles with complete seriesof old software anew(f.ex. Larry, KingsQuest SpaceQuest etc) .. that is because of Dosbox making it possible to run these games on windows(with sound and joystick etc).. I believe that they would stand on their rights. I hope that answers your question ajaybc."

Going to seed this one for a while too.

Found one error right on the spot.
How come DOOM 2 is published/created by Atari as according to the zipfile?
It has been created and distributed by ID Software and Atari had nothing to do with it."

,focusinon,2008-10-07T06:26Z,"If you only want one item from the archive, use the listing given
below (in later comments) to find which part has the desired item.

INSTRUCTIONS:

The full archive consists of 173 parts with labels like
""DOScollection.partXXX.rar"" where ""XXX"" ranges from 001 to 173.  Items
are stored alphabetically in the archive, and each part of the archive
can potentially have several dozen items.  The following list shows
the first item in each part of the archive.  Note that if an item
shows up explicitly in the list, it is also in the previous part of
the archive due to overlap (see examples).

Example 1:  If you wanted ""Mech War"", scanning the list shows that it
falls alphabetically between [Master Of Orion 2 Battle At Antares] and
[Merchant Prince].  Therefore, [Mech War] is in part 088.

Example 2:  To get ""Master Of Orion 2 Battle At Antares"", you would
need parts 086, 087, and 088.  You would ALSO NEED part 085 due to
overlap.

Example 3:  ""Beneath A Steel Sky"" is explicitly shown in part 018.
Therefore you would need parts 018 AND 017.

Example 4:  ""Leather Goddesses Of Phobos 2"" falls between [Le Grand
Manitou] and [Legend Of Kyrandia Hand Of Fate] because in ""computer
alphabetic"" sorting, the ""space"" symbol comes before the letter ""a"".
(Numbers also come before letters, but after the ""space"" symbol.)
Therefore, you would need part 075 only."

Dude, first,  he's definitely not an idiot. If you want to CHOOSE which game you want to play, than go straight to any shop that sells 'em and PAY for it. Don't look for it in torrent. If you do really AFFORD to buy it anyway...

Second, it's called classics asshole... Newer games don't always be better than classic ones. Depends on the player. But for some fuckers like you, I bet it's definitely hard to find a good one to play. Sucking your own dick should be the best game for you I suppose..."

Instead of changing one HD movie file and a subtitles addon into six dozen .RAR files and screwing the downloader, you have condensed thousands of separate files into a much smaller number of files - which is EXACTLY what archive formats like RAR are meant to be used for.

Any idea what might be causing this problem ? I really want this torrent :("
,nearadyn,2009-06-20T11:47Z,Excellent upload! Nearly all of them work on dosbox! I'm playing games that I haven't played in 20 years. Thanks!

Is it just me or is this the same for everyone else ? God damn Australian internet =[

Thanks anyway for a great torrent, mate. This is undoubtedly the best Abandonware one I've ever came across."

People having problems configuring DOSBox see this comment from andrisv1982:
---------------------------
Then concerning DOSbox, yeah I think some people can have trouble with it, but if you don't want to now all shit about configuration I came with solution for that:

Just make one shortcut to dosbox with this kind of structure for target destination (this is example for CIVILIZATION):
""C:\Program Files\DOSBox-0.65\DOSBox.exe"" -c ""mount c D:\dos-games\Civ"" -c c: -c civ.exe

But of course you have to modify it according to specific game you want to play (you have to show location of game and the lunching file).
---------------------------

Or maybe try installing Windows 98 in a virtual machine on VMWare Workstation:

People who only like one single game look at the focusinon comment I re-posted here:
http://pastebin.com/f32adb02a

Or try searching the game in Home of the Underdogs:

,nyiddle,2009-07-06T05:38Z,"damn...
I would've preferred to see multiple torrents featuring multiple games individually rather than a huge amount of rar archives...

this would be a sweet pack to download, but the fact that I can't download specific games individually dissuades me from bothering to get it."
,Furseiseki,2009-07-28T23:59Z,because unchecking everything and only checking what you want is SOOO hard.

I must say thanks to spelgubbe for his hard work in the upload, not many people would have bothered with this and still seed it TWO years later... I can't wait to play some of the games but mostly to remind me of my AMIGA as cannon fodder was my fav on that machine....

Again thanks to spelgubbe....."
,brohken,2009-08-13T21:28Z,"@Television_Imagination
get a newer version of Transmission."
,{Reingold},2009-08-17T19:28Z,i don't want your crappy old games. get a real computer that plays newer games you old packrat.
,giamarie,2009-08-22T02:10Z,I downloaded this game and it loads alright with dosbox but when i go to talk to the characters the computer always freezes. Anyone have any ideas?
,fish_fingers,2009-09-03T21:08Z,Would have been so much easier for everyone to not have packed them in rars.
,kelv1969,2009-09-12T19:18Z,would have been more useful if you hadn't rar'd the file. then a person could just download the games they wanted. think about that next time. good upload though. perhaps you could re-do it.

This takes me back to the days when you'd fork over $80 for a picturesque box, dive inside to find a manual the size of War & Peace and the precious 5 1/4"" disk. Then you'd marvel at the CGA graphics and the beeps and boops that would sometimes be described as music, remarking to all your friends how realistic this game is.

This pack is all killer, no filler, every one of them is legend. Good work!"
