The video is from 1984, and is a piece of the motivational video ""Be Somebody or Be Somebody's Fool!""
I am downloading that video right now and I might also upload it here if I have it.

Tell me right here if you like to see more of him :)"

I pity the fool that doesn't give us more T"
,ZeNiTH_NL,2007-01-18T07:39Z,"haha okay, I will upload more T when I have finished my download. Probably tomorrow!"
,ZeNiTH_NL,2007-01-19T12:46Z,"Okay, the rest is online right now!
Just search for MR-T right here on TPB.

Ps. I noticed that the quality of that video is better than this one, so if you like this song, you can cut it out of the other video with a program like mpeg-vcr.

Enjoy!, mvh, ZeNITH_NL"
