Lots of Slipknot and Rammstein and more.."
,Trotyl,2007-01-14T14:49Z,Napalm is always the most brutal ones...
,El_Trottos,2007-01-15T10:37Z,"Fuckin Moron!
All in one zip, why??

Thx anyway for the upload, but zipping music is... stupid"
,Trotyl,2007-01-15T13:06Z,"Making a torrent for each, is too much work moron !"
,havrefras1970,2007-01-17T19:21Z,You can just put all the albums in one folder and make the torrent out of that.
,Trotyl,2007-01-17T23:28Z,My Maketorrent can't handle maps under another map...
,emeizh,2007-01-19T14:57Z,use example Azureus or BitComet
,Ffejzilla,2007-03-19T18:55Z,Seeding....but you need the first 3 albums! damnit!
,Viriatus,2007-12-04T14:45Z,many thanks but idea of putting all songs in 1 zip file was bad idea because many people are only interesting in downloading selected albums or songs...
,witherdon,2008-04-03T21:16Z,"this is a great torrent thx 

and all u can fuck off all the albums in one is much easier to handle than them all individually!!"
