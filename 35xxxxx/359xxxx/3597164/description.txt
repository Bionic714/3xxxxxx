Hello. This time I bring U my favorites from my collection. It's mainly trance and progressive, but some techno and house tunes can be found as well. As U can see the torrent is quite massive but I assure U It's also worth dl'ing. At the beginning the speed will be low but after midnight my connection boosts x8 so I think it can handle it. I don't include the file list cause it's always available on the torrent site. Please help me with the seeding after you've finished. Write a comment as well if U like it.
