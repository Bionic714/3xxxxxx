,janihunyad,2007-01-16T05:40Z,wtf is TBC? tuberculosis?
,fortress,2007-01-16T05:47Z,Please seed this and TBC = The Burning Crusade for WOW 
,Dem123,2007-01-16T06:51Z,"I'm a little bit afraid to even think about executing the first part once I get it simply because it's an exe. Usually with parted .rar files you can just open them in WinRAR and it'll just extract the compiled version for you so I don't understand why the first part needs to be an .exe. So I'm just gonna wait for someone to confirm if it's valid and not some sort of keylogger combined with the archive...

I'll give the uploader the benefit of the doubt for now, Thanks for uploading! :)"
,Rhythalia,2007-01-16T07:21Z,This is WinRAR self-extracting exe I think. I hope this one works.
,Rhythalia,2007-01-16T07:33Z,Confirmation also needed for the region. There was a fake enUS.
,Bart91,2007-01-16T07:37Z,It is positively 100% confirmed a enUS client (finally). Trust me i wouldn't pull another catrix

,Bart91,2007-01-16T07:49Z,Just so everyone knows it will open a WinRaR installer called Titan Quest By Duxa which was the last file assembled before this it just never got renamed and also it is a .nrg image.
,niaxilin,2007-01-16T14:28Z,"I just finished the WoW_BC_ByDuxa.part1.exe torrent. Right-clicking ""Open with WinRAR"" on the file confirms it is a valid WinRAR self-extracting, and the Title is set to ""Titan Quest By Duxa"" (oops).

To be safe, I still used my own WinRAR to extract it, which eventually stopped to ask for Part 2. Will post again once I have all the parts."
,niaxilin,2007-01-16T16:17Z,"Works great! Thank!

Extracted all 5 files using WinRAR. Mounted the single image using DAEMON Tools. Installed this enUS 2.0.0 expansion on my enUS 2.0.5 WoW with no problems. Patched back up to 2.0.3 then to 2.0.5 and it's playing fine."
,Dem123,2007-01-16T19:21Z,"Yeah I just extracted it from one of the other parts instead of using the self extractor to be safe. Works perfectly fine, Thank you!"
,Arkadren,2007-01-17T23:28Z,mac or windows version?
,j_fingers,2007-01-20T15:46Z,Just finished downloading and extracted using (*gulp) the .exe self-extractor.  Burned the image to DVD using MagicIso and installed.  No problems whatsoever.  Thanks --
,pattyfattie,2007-01-23T22:57Z,so i extracted the files and they ended up to be .nrg files? what do i do with that??
