"I'm from a town where/everybody drowned and/Everybody died/But baby I'm still prayin' wit ya/Everybody cryin but/Ain't nobody tryin/There's no doubt on my mind/that it was, Georgia...Bush!" Led by a passionate and highly ambitious Lil Wayne, "Georgia...Bush", is by no means a typical anthem track. Philly native, DJ Drama cleverly borrows Disturbing Tha Peace's, A-town anthem which speaks volumes for the impressive level of creativity expressed throughout Dedication 2 (Gangsta Grillz). The Holigrove, Cash Money, Young Money representa, offers a personal reflection regarding his political angst and grand affection for his Hurricane Katrina deposed home. Weezy F. Baby aka independently voted "The President" and DJ Drama's Dedication 2 (D2) is an energized and poignant, music extravaganza for all Hip-Hop fans.

D2 features many highpoints, lyrically and musically, just in time for summer. The southern bounce inspired, "Get Em" sets off the 25 track jambalaya. "Cannon (AMG Edition)" hints to the diversity found throughout the musical medley. With steady horns laced under Wayne's almost seamless flow, he leads an impressive group of strong lyricist, including Freeway, Willie the Kid, Detroit Red and Juice. "Cannon (AMG Edition)" can easily be a contender for a new-age Hip-Hop classic.

With Weezy offering his own take over so many hits, snagging instrumentals from Dem Franchize Boyz ("They Still Like Me") to T.I. ("What U Kno"), D2 does not disappoint. "Sportscenter" deserves special attention. Not only does the bass driven track, entice a sincere "lean back" moment, Wayne?s lyrical delivery is glossy. He opens with, "Cover my tracks like butter so where the bread be/I see beef as dead meat." Post the Carter II, a confident, rightfully so, Weezy glides over the track like the veteran he is-even if he is only 23-years old.

Aside from Lil Wayne's own solid lyrical performance, he shares the mic with Hip-Hop heavy weights. "Welcome to tha Concrete Jungle" opens with Juelz Santana, who appears again on "No Other". Sharing most of the collaboration time is Lil Wayne's, Young Money artists, Currency and Mac Maine. "Poppin Them Bottle" and "Ridin Wit the AK" are the most notable tracks featuring the trio. Remy Martin is featured on the slick, "Where the Cash A and Pharell, the chameleon, appears on "Gettin Some Head".

Lil Wayne and Hip-Hop aficionado DJ Drama is a proven team. The streets, any street from N.O. to Philly to N.Y. to L.A. can "bounce", "snap", "lean back" or "gangsta boogie" to this explosive second journey, Dedication 2.
