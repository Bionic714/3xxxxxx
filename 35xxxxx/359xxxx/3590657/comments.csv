At least in most games, there's SUPPOSED to be a point to all the bloodshed - this has no point, and is a shitty game besides.

,youngidealist,2007-09-21T20:49Z,"Just to clarify, the reason the author made this game is because the attack was close to home for him and he didn't want people to forget that these things happen. There's a line to be drawn between snuff entertainment and bearing witness to tragic events. Unfortunately that line is purely motive and cannot be enforced or judged honestly by someone outside of the individual user. Don't be so stupid as to think that people with weak stomachs are always doing the right thing and that people who are more calloused are inherently hateful. You should engage in these things only knowing full well that you cannot unwatch potentially traumatic events.

A personal example is when I watched the dramatized movie on Gacy, I was sick to my stomach and having flash backs of it for weeks. It's still difficult for me to think about it, and all it was that made watching that movie trigger trauma in me is that the full potential of denial and pretend-happy  family living was realized by this story of a real serial killer. It even reminded me of real people I've met in my life and apparently thought too little about. The reality of what happened to me for having watched that movie is that my body reacted naturally to a traumatic thought and while I might be slightly suffering from having watched it, I don't blame the people who made it. These types of horrors are to be experienced at your own risk. If you make a mistake and go too far, take a long break from such things to gain back some peace of mind. Don't make much more of a fuss about it than that."

,D4RK-PIRAT3,2008-02-29T20:02Z,"Thanks muchly for the seed~
I'm having a bit of trouble now, though; I was able to install and start the game, but when I get to the start menu, I can't select or do anything unless I quickly switch from one window to another (in windowed mode obviously), and when in-game I can't move or anything. My keyboard works, so does anyone know what the problem could be? ^^;"
,D4RK-PIRAT3,2008-03-03T03:44Z,"Nevermind, reinstalled from an HTTP download and it works fine now.

,AlkyX,2012-03-22T07:38Z,Quit labeling this game everyone.This game does not promote colombine.Its sole purpose is to help you understand what both the killers and the victims went through.
