DISCLAIMER:  This DVD is provided as a  resource for those interested in such matters. I do not condone, glorify or promote violence or football hooliganism.
So plz don?t come here and write what I should do and vice versa. if you don?t like it...don?t download it..it?s easy.

 I give you "THE ENGLISH ARE COMING"




This Dvd-R is a compilation of two interesting mainstream documentaries produced by BBC on the english football hooligans.


and so we have this again. this is not a political statement...
