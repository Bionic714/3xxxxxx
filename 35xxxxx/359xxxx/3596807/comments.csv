,Crudstikles,2007-07-28T05:20Z,"For anyone who got stuck with extracting: 

Well when you open the file you will see that there are 51 rar. files. Select them all. Then right click one of them and press ""Extract to specific folder"" then once is finnished go to that folder and click and drag that CSO. to your ISO folder on your psp."
