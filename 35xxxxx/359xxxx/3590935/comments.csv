,sosofake,2007-03-09T15:37Z,"Anybody care to make more authoritative subtitles? Good work stu, but they need quite a bit of work -- a bit too literal."
,stu,2007-03-13T00:20Z,"it is easy enough for a fluent french speaker to revamp my subtitles, as they are already timed up. simply open the .srt as you would a .txt file and edit the words. then upload a copy here: 
http://www.opensubtitles.org

find me on the freakyflicks forums for any help.

sosofake:- if you know they are 'too literal' then you must have a good understanding of french, why dont you have a go?"
