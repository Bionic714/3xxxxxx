Chris Markers sublime review of the millennium so far. His camera cuts
across the streets of Paris, via the mÃ©tro, via TV, via the internet.
the trite of politicians, the noise of demonstration marches, the
poignancy of funeral processions. via the subtle gaze of girls, and the
mischievous gaze of M. Chat. 

These cuts, put together, provide a document of the past 4 years, it's
roots to the past, and a glimpse of its future.

- to get the most out of this film it helps to know a bit about French current affairs. 
- note, out of interest, the many references to surrealists, and their cultural legacy.
