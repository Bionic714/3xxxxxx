,MT343,2009-04-03T16:41Z,"Ditto. WHICH BOOK edition/year is VERY IMPORTANT for Assimil. I just bought WRONG Spanish with Ease 1987, isbn 2700501314, new from Assimil France. No meta tag info, maybe very old or ripped from non English edition.

I suggest don't download this unless you know which book !!! FYI first file starts off with ""Un aperitivo; Buenos dias, una tapa de tortilla por favor"" etc "
,skiper2002,2009-05-12T23:45Z,"If it starts with ""Un aperitivo; Buenos dias, una tapa de tortilla por favor"" then it's the newest edition.

Most torrents you can find correspond to the mid eighties version of the book, the one that starts with ""Buenos Dias Pablo. Ana ! Quel Tal estas ?""

I hope people seed. I've been looking for this for a long time."
