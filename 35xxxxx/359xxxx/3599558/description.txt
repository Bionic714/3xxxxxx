A guide to project management book of knowledge 3rd edition -  PMBOK 2004

The PMBOK is a collection of processes and knowledge areas generally accepted as best practice within the project management discipline.

The PMBOK is an internationally recognised standard (IEEE Std 1490-2003) that provides the fundamentals of project management that are applicable to a wide range of projects, including construction, software, engineering, automotive, etc.

PMBOK recognizes 5 basic process groups and 9 knowledge areas typical of almost all projects. The basic concepts are applicable to projects, programs and operations. The five basic process groups are:

Initiating, 
Planning, 
Executing, 
Controlling and Monitoring, and 
Closing. 
Processes overlap and interact throughout a project or phase. Processes are described in terms of:

Inputs (documents, plans, designs, etc.) Tools and Techniques (mechanisms applied to inputs) Outputs (documents, products, etc.)


Section II of the PMBOK lists the Nine Knowledge Areas and the sub areas. They are listed below.
