,chaos_dreamhelper,2007-01-18T10:03Z,UW :)...btw this is one of the best Scenery's of SD.  i can give 5/5
,neslesman,2007-01-19T02:16Z,"This file totally toasted my FS9 and made it unusable.  Aircraft textures where falling apart and flying everywhere and scenery textures were toast, all mixed up and all.  If it happens to you get rid of the module SDScene.DLL and the effects file fx_SDSmoke.fx. from this scenery. Had I not remembered those two files the sim would now be unusable right now.

Why is a simple scenery installing a module anyway?  

Not saying it will happen to you but it happened to me, big time and those two files were the culprits. "
