Myth 2 Soulblighter,  a classic,   works on OS X and has 2 app versions,  one for PowerPC  the other Intel macs,  the intel macs crashes on powerPC  so  run the powerpc one instead   works great on my intel mac,  and just mount the image and copy the "fake image to your applications folder"  and play!   have fun!
