,pilatuspilot,2007-01-14T00:40Z,"""neslesman"", Thank you so very much for sharing this important series with your fellow flying enthusiasts pilots. It's very kind of you to bother preparing the torrent and using up your bandwidth so that other's can learn the mighty lessons shown and discussed.
I have a couple of hangar pals who've been using my copy among themselves for some time. Now I can have them download their own copies and get mine back for my own constant review.
Good on ya, mate."
