,mileschris,2007-01-15T19:17Z,Thanks for uploading Above and Beyond. The show used to be uploaded weekly but it's been absent for several weeks. Thanks again for the upload.
,MadMat666,2007-01-15T21:43Z,no problem. I'll try to upload them weekly.
,MrSly,2007-01-16T17:38Z,Above & Beyond :-) thankx Mat
,mileschris,2007-01-17T20:24Z,"MM, if you could provide a weekly upload that would be sweet -- and greatly appreciated.  Personally, I enjoy Trance Around the World more than ASoT.  I'm not knocking Van Buuren, I simply enjoy the vibe of Above and Beyond's sets.  ANYway, enough drivel.
Thanks again.
