,akmdw,2008-11-06T09:54Z,"File looks allright. On my 4.01 M33, the file will not show up unless you rename it. All the bits in the brackets at the end probably confuses the PSP."

He compressed it in a .rar, so it's already compressed. I mean, it would save me some time of converting it before putting it on my psp, but it wouldnt make a difference in file size if he compressed it to .cso before uploading."
