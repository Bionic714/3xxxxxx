,storytold,2008-12-01T02:16Z,"The RAR wouldn't extract correctly for me. I went to their site here: http://www.pspaudioware.com/ and downloaded their demo exe. Then I applied the username and serial number that you listed here and activated it. 

Works great so far - the 15 day trial notice disappeared at least? lol"
,Imyme,2011-10-15T00:59Z,Serial doesn't work any-more. Ideas on how to register?
,Kiweed,2012-02-17T13:05Z,Thanks alot! Serial worked fine for me 4 months after the latter comment says it doesn't...
,xXAstrixxXx,2012-08-08T20:38Z,"^No, the serial doesn't work anymore. 

For some reason, it only works in a workstation when running the DX plugin. 

But as far as wanting to use the VST, it doesn't work and locks up the plugin. 
In other words: if I want to use Ableton or another DAW that doesn't support DX plugins with this, than I can forget about it. 

Thanks a lot, Team AiR. "
