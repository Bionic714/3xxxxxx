This is an interesting curiosity. This band was from the Boston area, and released this one album in 1976. Like the group Tavares, they were Cape Verdian from Portugal, and their music was somewhat of a similar sound. This is an all over the place album-disco, r & b ballads, funk, pop-but it works pretty well for the most part.
I was aware of this band years ago, but didn't find this album until about 15 years ago in a used record store. A few years back, I found a new, sealed copy of the LP on eBay, and that's the copy I used to rip these files. What you hear is the first playing of thirty year old virgin vinyl. I transferred it at 312Kbps, and it sounds great.
I encourage you to give this a listen and seed it for others to discover. I include a crappy jpg file of the front and back covers.
