,G4MER,2007-01-20T15:51Z,Would you say that the one i'm actually downloading (61%) is NOT working? Thanks for the answer_
,G4MER,2007-01-20T16:20Z,"""Stop my torrent and open this one into the same place as the old one. This new one will fix the corrupted pieces in the dmg. Also, it has lots of seeds. Remember, throw out the torrent, NOT THE DMG!""
Please tell us what has to be done: stop the torrent and replace or throw previous one and restart from here? Thanks in advance_"
,mikethejones,2007-01-20T16:26Z,"  Stop and Remove the first posted torrent.  Open the Reseed torrent and tell it to save in the same folder (whichever you chose for the original torrent). The download will continue where it left off.  For example, if you are at 35% right now, the Reseed torrent will check and show that the file is 35% done and, when you tell it to Start, (or Force Start) the file will pick up at the last piece it has."

,Sawta,2008-08-18T15:28Z,"(I'll assume that whoever is torrenting this bought the game and just can't find the CD-Key or something like that.)    

This is exactly how you get this game to run on OSX 10.4.11 (Should work similarly with 10.5.whatever, but you will probably need a different CD Crack)

1) You need this to get the game to run.  No burning the game to a disk will not get around this step:  http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3964660/Age_of_Empires_3_No-CD_Crack_Leopard_by_Nozio (This is what makes the game run, even without a CD Key/CD Disk, hence the name.)
2) Mount ""Age of Empires3.toast"".  If you aren't familiar with UNIX terms, it means just double click it and the OS will do all the work.  You DON'T need toast 8 titanium or whatever else!
3) On the left hand side (of Finder), you will see Age of Empires 3 listed.  Choose that and drag the ""Age of Empires III.app"" to your applications bar (or wherever you want to store all your THOUSANDS of Mac games).
4) Mount ""Age of Empires 3 NO CD Crack.dmg""
5) Hit agree, and whatever else is listed.  When another tab comes up on the left again, choose that one, and choose the application with the same name.
6) When the .app launches, choose the location to wherever you stored Age of Empires 3.app (See step 3)
That should be about it.  If you have problems, it probably means that you have OS X 10.5.whatever.  Search the top 100 mac games and there will probably be a NO CD crack AoE3 for OS X 10.5 on there some where.

Oh, and when you play AoE3, it will create a new folder in your Documents folder, so don't delete it unless you want to get rid of all of your progress."

** ATTENTION ** ! ! !

NO MORE CRACK NEEDED !!!!

Although i didnt download Age of Empires 3 for Mac from this particular torrent i got mine working with 2 simple steps.

Step 1: Install AOE3 and/or Expansions

Step 2: Update AOE3 to the latest patch (1.05) and then update the expansions to the latest patch. heres a link to all the patches
http://destineergames.com/support/?page_id=88

Its that easy!

Now Age of Empire 3 should even work online, no crack needed because the latest updates remove the cd check, just download Gameranger create a free account and your good to go.

Hope this helps. If you still cant get Age of Empires III to work then its because you failed to follow my simple steps.

See you on the battlefield! xD"
