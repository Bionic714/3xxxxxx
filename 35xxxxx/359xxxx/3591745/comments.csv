,JohnyFiama,2007-01-07T20:24Z,"@harregukalerik: I know! :P I just can't stand when some people make false claims about my torrents (or any torrents for that matter), like those ass wads who wrote a bunch of fuckin' crap in the beginning. Damn, I hate trollers!! They should all burn in hell, seriously!

,ang3l2006,2007-01-07T22:02Z,thanx JF and of course i help with seeding as alwys...
,JohnyFiama,2007-01-07T22:25Z,"@punk kid: Good luck finding my real IP address... Just do yourself a favor and hang yourself! That way we don't have to cope with filthy spammers like you! Absolutely disgusting! Hopefully, I can shit on your grave once you end up burning in hell!!"
,JohnyFiama,2007-01-07T22:26Z,@Trojan Kit: Just read the comment above. It applies to you as well since you both are the same clones!
,JohnyFiama,2007-01-07T22:29Z,"@punk kid: Hey, you might wanna take a computer networking class before talking a bunch of crap about IP addresses. I recommend ""Networking 101"". Or, just read ""Dummy's Guide to FreeBSD"". You fuckin' spammer!"
,JohnyFiama,2007-01-07T23:00Z,"@punk kid: Obviously, you have *ZERO* knowledge when it comes to online message board netiquettes. And, for fuck's sake, don't make such a big dick out of yourself. You don't have to preach about IP addresses and so on. I'm a network admin, so you would be the last person to talk to me about IP addresses. 
Just look at your fuckin' nick. It tells it all: you are a punk! Well, I know you are not a punk in real life. You're just behaving like one. Don't be such a lamer! I know you and your clones have been spamming my torrent pages all the time. Actually, I have no reason to be bothered. The fact is, you're only congesting TPB's web server by putting such an effort into literally killing it with a bunch of useless spam and false claims about malware. 
As a human being, I feel sorry for you because you don't know what harms you are causing to this site. And, no I'm NOT going to report you to the admin because you're not worth it. But, for God's sake, leave me alone if you have nothing wise to say!! That's all I'm demanding. So, please behave!

JohnyFiama: you rock *thumbs up*"
[V],Allfader,2007-01-08T20:39Z,JF: by the way... what is the different between retail and tria???l.... i know the trial... but offer retail something trial donÂ´t??? newbie :D
,JohnyFiama,2007-01-09T11:43Z,"@Allfader: No problem! :) I can explain in greater detail.. There are two main differences between the trial and the retail (commercial) versions. These differences have to do with two main things: the core application and the update module:
A) Core Application -- The most obvious difference is that trial versions are only used for evaluation purposes, so they will expire after they pass the  30-day trial limit. But, retail versions never expire. And what happens if it expires? Well, you will be forced to buy the retail version through ESET or their resellers.
B) Update Module -- This is perhaps the most important and most significant reason to use the commercial version. If you use the retail (commercial) versions of NOD32, its update module will give you the fastest security. Sometimes, it gives you updates up to 4 times a single day. This would never take place if you were using a trial version. The reason why you get faster updates is because retail versions have their update servers at a high-security remote location, situated away from the trial servers. And, we are talking about high-priority servers that will give you the latest virus defs as soon as new threats have been found. Besides, you NEVER have to stand in line to get your updates. Instead they will be delivered to you very quickly. 
I think I've been too specific in this response. But if you have any further questions, don't hesitate to ask them. :)

,JohnyFiama,2007-01-09T13:39Z,"@bru cifer: Yes, I agree with you! :) By the way, in case you didn't see my response to your questions about difficulties you had with some malware, I can post it here. The reason I'm reposting it is because I'm about to delete the previous torrent were your comment was sent:
""Sorry I thought you were trolling all the time. But, now I guess you are more realistic than I imagined. So, you have my appology for that.
Well, first of all, I have no intentions or aims of putting malicious codes inside my uploads. My objective is to keep everything clean whether it be the software (from malicious codes) or the keys (from blacklisting).
My recommendation, if you want to tackle any threats, is to use a multi-layered security strategy. That being said, you should avoid security suites (they have a nature of being insecure) and stick with many different best-of-kind softwares. Here's an example:
1) For intrusions: router (hardware firewall), software firewall, packet-filterer, HIPS (Host Intrusion Prevention System) [buffer overflow protection, sandboxing virtualization, aplication protection, registry protection]
2) For malware: Anti-Virus, Anti-Spyware, etc.
3) Also, you should consider patching up your system by installing latest security patches (I recommend Windows Update and the Gibson Research Center) and keep your operating system/programs up to date. In addition, you should consider using a more secure web browser (I highly recommend Firefox or Opera). Internet Explorer is very vulnerable to threats because it is closely attached to the Windows operating sysem core. Finally, be cautious about which web pages you visit.

Sorry for the re-post! :("
,XweAponX,2007-03-15T05:22Z,"Wow, whatd I miss? I sent JF a message, the first arclogin crack opens a webpage, directly to an antipiracy  org I'm checking it out right now.

It has a dot-tk address, redirects to a doman host in Germany. Once I install my shit I'll know who owns the site. Fyuckin peer guarian lit up like a christmas tree when the page tried to load.

By the amount of gargabe that *used* to be here, loooks like this is one hell of a good torrent."
