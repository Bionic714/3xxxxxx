Benefit from the capabilities of your HDTV, experience PS2 games in High Definition (HD) via your PS2 console. 

Select from Enhanced Definition, High Definition or VGA modes (VGA Adaptor available separately*) to give a clearer, more crisp picture quality for your PS2 games. 

Simply load the Xploder HDTV Player software disc, select your required settings, (the best output will be dictated by your HDTV set and the game, generally we recommend the 576p mode for the best PAL results) position the screen image in the required location and experience games as they were meant to be viewed.

Comes as a rar with an iso for burning to cd and also come with an elf for execution in launchers like uLaunchELF. Another small release for everyone to enjoy. I have heard that it only shows true high definition (720p, 1080i) on very few games. Progressive scan works with every game I've tried. I don't have a component cord :(
