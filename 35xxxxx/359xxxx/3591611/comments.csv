,Naijrfahr,2007-01-07T17:59Z,"You're doing a great job lkobescak!

But you've uploaded so many things all at once, so the speed is really slow.... It's taking at least 2 weeks for me to get just the 911 Mysteries DVD.

Next time I would recommend that you use uTorrent and enable super-seeding mode (it's called Initial-Seeding in uTorrent)... it's faster than the normal way, especially if you have slow speed and upload large files. Once a few people have the complete torrent you disable initial-seeding."
,Naijrfahr,2007-01-07T18:05Z,"btw, I'm sure you know this and was only making fun but for those who don't know, 

""Maybe you guys should have voted for John Kerry, George Bushs cousin"" - They did that, the majority voted for Kerry but democracy doesn't work in a dictatorship. Also, even if Kerry would be president it would be ZERO difference. Bush+Kerry=cousins, both of them are members of Skull & Bones and admit it, both of them are puppets to the higher-ups in the NWO (the international private bankers, the United Nations, the Bilderberg Group... just to name a few)"
,intheb0x,2007-01-07T18:33Z,"where do you get these numbers? 

any proof to what your saying? 



what do you think kerry would have done for our country? welfare reform...? 

please get your head out your ass and stop watching micheal moore movies.. 

ask any troop that comes back from iraq.. they will be shocked when they turn on and all they show is the death in iraq. 

they never show the positives. 

terrorism kills roughly 300? 

did everyone just forget about september 11th? 

i think so. 

these people are trying to kill us and your family but you sit back and just give them more ammo for there guns. 

pathetic. 

you people are anti american./ 


have fun watching cnn and msnbc 

and reading the washington post



if yoiu dont know the economy is BOOMING in iraq.. everything is up. the people in iraq been killing eachother for years hundreds of years. its there religion. why dont you research a little before you start posting your liberal crap and a view that noone wants to hear. another thing. u say they kill roughly 300. what about our troops that died? they werent killed by terrorists tho right? got another movie to defend that statement?

stop posting pure rhetoric and your own ""chaotic"" views and start getting some cold hearted facts."
,carribean,2007-01-07T21:58Z,"Barrie Zwicker is another jew trying to control the damage. Any thinking person understands that 911 was planned by Mossad, just to get Americans to go kill some more arabs for the sake of Israel.

,polsy37,2007-01-08T04:14Z,"Hey Naijrfahr, you freaking moron, John Kerry never won the majority of the presidential vote. You might be referring to the time when Al Gore won the  popular vote, but not the presidency. Small detail, and I understand conspiracy theorists like to overlook them to tell a more interesting story, so don't worry about. Idiot. I'm not even American and I knew that."
,Peaknik,2007-01-08T12:32Z,Kerry would have won had they bothered to properly re-count the votes.  Not that it would have mattered. US Presidents either subject to the hidden puppet masters or get assasinated. 
,Naijrfahr,2007-01-08T22:19Z,"Well said, Peaknik, well said."
,Nocturn3,2007-01-09T10:34Z,"""There are 2 kinds of people, the ones who want to do something about these worthless radicals and ones who sit there bitching and complaining not knowing what the fuck they are talking about.""

Which one are you, exactly?


""You idiots who believe this rhetoric live a world of conspiracies, how sad that must be.""

This from someone who assumes that anyone who doesn't swallow everything the media tells them is a ""raghead"" and a ""jihadi"".

BTW, your main contributions here (other than your BS) are flight sim add-ons.  You are helping to train these ""jihadis"" to fly planes into buildings, by giving them the means to learn how."
,roddyf,2007-01-09T13:32Z,"Bush, Chaney, Rumsfeld, the CIA & FBI heads and the US military leaders and the people that control them, Mainly the banking cartels including the federal reserve, which is a privately owned bank.Should have all been Strung up with Sadam. For they are the only true terrorists. Anyone who does not question there Leaders over 911 is a coward and a traitor. Millions of Americans now believe 911 was an inside job. You will never get the truth from the mainstream news networks as they are controlled by the banking cartel. American soldiers are Dying for a lie. You cannot bring democracy to a country from a country that has lost its democracy, and where the people allow the powers at be to use there constitution as toilet paper. WAKE THE FUCK UP!"

,max11max,2007-01-09T23:45Z,"The U.S.A. have dropped bombes on 50 countries since WWII, They have killed more people than the Germans did in WW1 and WW2 put together. There is only one world dictator and that is the U.S. Government. One day that will come to an end, till then beware. If you have oil or something else the U.S.A. want then you will DIE protecting it. Long live democracy, long live the U.S.A. Zeek Hile."
,intheb0x,2007-01-14T06:58Z,"Millions of americans think its a inside job?

ANY PROOF TO THIS?

no i think not.
pure BS



you still dont answer my question
where do you get 650,000 from?
any proof to that number?
i think not.

also dont you remember saddam NOT letting weapons inspectors come in to look.
what was there to hide?

did you forget about the russians coming in there right before the war happened..
?
im sure thats where the wmds went.
when you have every intelligence agency in the
world telling you he has them what would you do?

but no one ever brings up the nerve agents found and such. those arent big weapons right?

you talk about us having nuclear weapons.
SO WHAT?
god knows we arent going to use them
but take IRAN for example
you want him to have NUCLEAR weapons so he can WIPE ISREAL off the map as he said NUMEROUS amounts of time.

that arguement is garbage talking about us having wmds but they dont.

keep your crap rheroric to yourself.

also whats so bad about fox news?
are you mad its the only news agency that shows BOTH sides of the story and not your sorry pathetic side?

dont even bring up how we killed a few innocent people and how the soliders died. since when do we worry about causalties of a war before going in? theres always more casulties.

what about the murder rate in some citys in the us? alot higher then that.
come on

its not my problem clinton was a pushover for saddam.. u know clinton and his STRONG WORDED LETTERS really showed how strong the US was..


alot of the people in iraq have been killing eachother for many many years. its there religon. thats how it works for them.

you say thats half the world hates bush.
who cares?
honestly answer that question.

the terrorists are mad that they cant plan and follow through on attacks in the US anymore.
there mad that we are in iraq and blowing them up. you guys support the terrorists.
point blank.

stop talkin about how it was wrong how we went into iraq.
it happened we did it your side voted for it.
we cant just pull out now.
ask any troop what they think.
they will tell you we have to stay. ask any troop that comes back over here and turns on the tv.

they wont believe the negativity they see on tv. the anti american views all over tv.
ask them seriously they will tell you about the good things going on there.

you know before saddam like 10% had cellphones. now that went up to what? 80%.
the pay increases and the job rate is going up and up.
dont forget about the iraqis voting.
they just did that for no reason tho right?

you guys won stop being so angry all the time
lol

now pull us out of iraq and make the us look soft. make iran laugh at us more.. you know like you guys said we need to TALK to iran and syria.. they will tell us what to do right???????????do something better for the country like welfare reform and public health care
lmfao!"
