The Great Conspiracy: The 9/11 News Special You Never Saw
---------------------------------------------------------

Hosted by Barrie Zwicker

According to Barrie Zwicker, ?It is from the mainstream media that most people
get most of their information, most of the time, on most subjects.? The fact that the US mass media universally supported the ?offi cial story? of 9/11 explains why most Americans still believe it. However, when VisionTV, Canada?s only independent
television network, questioned Bush and company?s conspiracy theory by airing Barrie?s 6-part commentary series, ?The Great Deception? in 2002, it got the greatest viewer response in the channel?s 15-year history.
