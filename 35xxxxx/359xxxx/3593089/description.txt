REVIEW:
Despite a few gear problems, and Rusty and Andy both recovering from a touch of the flu, it was good to see the boys having fun. Dave busted the moves, as ever. The other addition was the violinist from Uncle Bill (whose name escapes me, apologies) who added some texture to 'Cream and The Crock' and an almost western swing/country feel to 'Trainspottin'

As ever, Tim and Rusty had some amusing banter, Tim gracing us with a spot-on impression of Michael Parkinson interviewing Hugh Grant, and sending out hello's to Rocio and Ruby. I'll be interested to see how much gets edited down for the telly.

As regarding the set list, I was fully expecting a slew of cuts from 'Dress Me Slowly'. It said some nice things about the band that they could pick out a nicely left of centre selection of older songs.

I've long been interested in how a band with a few albums under their belt relates to their earlier material. The re-occuring comment made of the last Dylan tour was that it's great strength was Bob had come to terms with the iconic 'greatest hits' and didn't mind playing them. It's a situation unique to music, that a performer can (figuratively) paint their first painting again and again, and if a musician can fully embrace the spectrum of their career and be as happy with a song from their first album as with something they just wrote, it says good things about them.
