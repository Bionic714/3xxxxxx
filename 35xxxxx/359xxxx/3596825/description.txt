Description
Detective Dwight Faraday (Brian Benben) is a burntout cop demoted to the ?weird calls? desk until a series of bizarre murders suddenly grabs his attention: Several men killed by massive blunt force trauma while in a state of sexual arousal, all last seen in the company of a sexy Native American woman (Cinthia Moura). But when it?s discovered that these corpses were trampled into hamburger by what appear to be hooves, Faraday must hunt a killer who may not be totally human.Will one cynical cop be caught like a deer in the headlights or has a horrifying seductress risen from legend to slaughter the horny? Anthony Griffith co-stars in this erotic horror comedy co-written and directed by John Landis (ANIMAL HOUSE,THE BLUES BROTHERS) and featuring grisly gore effects by Gregory Nicotero & Howard Berger (KILL BILL, LAND OF THE DEAD, CHRONICLES OF NARNIA).
