1. Install Vag-com.
2. Install xStarter and copy the .key to the installation directory of xStarter.
3. Copy the directory [Vag-com Crack Copy] to c:\Programm Files\
4. Startup xStarter and make a scheduled "copy" action (fig1.jpg)
5. Set the time stamp at 5 sec (fig2.jpg)

Run the task.
Now every 5 seconds the cracked files will be copied to the Vag-Com directory too fool Vag-com if it where registered. Every time a user makes a interaction in Vag-Com it will modify the copied files so that the programm will not be registered anymore. This method will prevent this ;o)
