Adventure games have had limited replay value until now. Scavenger Hunter is a replayable game that randomly generates a new playing field for every new game. The AI software also ensures that tool locations, puzzles, puzzle solutions, treasures and their hiding places are changed each time the player begins a fresh game.

Over 4,400 pre-rendered scenes are used to create this unique game, which we believe makes ""Scavenger Hunter"" the largest ""Indie"" game ever shipped.

Game Scenario: You are a member of the Inter-Universe Insurance Corporation's elite ""Scavenger Hunter"" task force, charged with traveling to alien worlds to locate and retrieve property stolen by ""The Scavengers"", a race of light fingered alien artists. You will encounter numerous obstacles along the way that will test your puzzle solving skills and attention to your surroundings. Recover everything on your list and a handsome reward will await you on your return to Earth."

I swear to god, i have nightmares about this game. Download at your own risk. This is one of those really bad games.

So, yeah, maybe youre thinking ""hey, could be fun to see just how bad it is!"". But the music, god , the music! ItÂ´s in my head! I canÂ´t get it out! Who the fuck wrote that lousy music?! Who the fuck would do such a thing?! Godfuck! Release me! FUCK!

....yeah. But its a great game, try it."
