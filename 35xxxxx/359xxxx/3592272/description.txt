"The Diary of Jane" was the first single off of Phobia. It's interesting to note
that "The Diary of Jane" was the fastest added song ever, in Hollywood Records'
History, topping such mega stars as Queen.

"You", was played live for the first time during an all acoustic set at "Concert
for a Cause IV" in April of 2006, while the band was still in the recording
process. In a radio interview with shallowbay.com, Burnley revealed that he had
mistakenly forgotten the chorus of the song during the set.

"Topless", is an old fan favorite, tracing back to the days before "Saturate".
Aaron Fink, the band's guitarist, accidentally revealed that the song would be
included on the album during a radio interview for shallowbay.com.

The first pressing of the record (all copies that will be in stores as of 8/8)
will include The Diary of Jane (acoustic version). It will be deleted
immediately after the initial release.
