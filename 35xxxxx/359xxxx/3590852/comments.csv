,v000,2008-05-08T00:21Z,Waste of time. Got Tyrian 2000 for Windows with patches from http://members.iinet.net.au/~vannevar/tyrian/downloads.html and OST thanks to http://filmmusic.ru/2008/04/17/soundtrack-tyrian/.

Great game! .. however, I have only played the registered version of 1.0 or 1.1 (which I can't find anywhere). In Tyrian 2000, they added some kind of annoying V-shaped shadow in ""hard"" and higher difficulty settings. Anyone know how to disable that? It totally sucks - it's like only showing 100x100 pixels in the middle of the screen while playing a first person shooter (to make it ""harder"")..

Thanks for the upload.. please seed for a few minutes - we're at 95% here."
