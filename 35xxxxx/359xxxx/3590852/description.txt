This is a couple of copys of the game Tyrian and Tyrian 2000.  I downloaded it and now I'm re-upping it.  It's been released as freeware

It's a vertical scrolling shooter I think is how it's described.  I usually describe it as "fun".

The orignal was made to run on DOS (yes it's that old).  Version 2.1 (included) has timeing issues with faster processors (worked on a 400MHz AMD K6-III, did not work on an 850MHz slot A Athlon).  There is some programs out there to fix that, the one in the info I found was "dosbox" (included).  Later the game was given another level, made to work right with faster processors (works great on an AND Athlon 4400+ X2) and retitled "Tyrian 2000" (included x2).  The orignal creator of the program re-leased a disk image of the Tyrian 2k version (first copy, included; the .CCD, .IMG, and .SUB files are this one), but the program that he used (CloneCD, also included) didn't make ISOs and my burning program (burn at one (not included) woudlnt' burn it.  I downloaded a copy of the CloneCD (included, not free but has a 21 day trial period) and created a disk with it and then made a disk image with my burn at once (second copy, included; that is the .dat and .toc files) since it's freeware.

Basicly, ther eisn't anything that you can't get someplace else in this, except you don't have to go anyplace else, because it IS right here.

Please pick this up and re-seed it even if you don't plan on playing it, I don't know how long I can keep it seeded.

Thank you for your time;
