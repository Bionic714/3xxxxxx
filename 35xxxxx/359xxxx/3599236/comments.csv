,Sovare,2007-01-20T11:41Z,"And what on earth is ""Windows Sys32 subpartition""?"
,Sovare,2007-01-20T12:23Z,"THERE ARE NO VIRII IN MY TORRENT.

And avis are movie containers, they are not containers of anything. Windows will not try to _execute_ an avi, it will merely invoke a mediaplayer to play it. Windows treats any AVI as pure data.

Now, I've PMed both of you, I expect a reply.

To the rest of you guys, if you are worried, just head over to the forums posted in the INFO. Or get the movie from the Divx source:

Cheers.

,polsy37,2007-01-20T16:41Z,"There is no virus. Good movie by someone who is sick of all the baseless accusations and unfounded BS by the CT pigeons. I can't complain about spelling errors, because I'm not ambitious enough to put the effort forth to do something like this, this guy was. 

But I'm sure some brilliant pigeon will figure out that we're all zionist, illuminati, government agents, and that this video was made to look amateurish just to fool people. 

I actually don't want these CT idiots to realize how ridiculous there accusations are, as it provides me with great entertainment, and adds credence to my crusade for government initiated strerilization of selected morons.

Thank you for the post. "
,defaultdotxbe,2007-01-20T19:18Z,"theres no freaking virus, this just goes to show you the ""truth"" movement is afraid of the real truth"
,Cl1mh4224rd,2007-01-21T02:54Z,"Hah! The kooks condemn the government and, well... just about anyone who doesn't agree with them, for using disinformation tactics.

But what do we have here? NotYourGrandMaa and jonasgreven... talking lies. Yes, people... these are members of your so-called Truth Movement."

Conspiracy theories are a known form of Fascist, even Stalinist propaganda.   The KGB admitted to using and spreading various AIDS conspiracy theories as has the CIA about UFO conspiracies, in its propaganda war against the Soviets.

Hitler and the Nazi's employed conspiracy theories to blame Jews, Communists, Masons and so forth for the very activities the Nazi's themselves were engaged in.

The dictator Stalin did likewise.

Note the irrational and fanatic zeal displayed of conspiracy theorists here. It is indicative of their neo-fascist ideology and irrational psychological profile.

Go to any Far Right, neo-Nazi, White/Islamist Supremacist, Islamo-fascist website and conspiracies form a core diet and staple for their hate propaganda.

Thanks to the uploader for forwarding a calm, cool and rational response to the barking mad ravings and complete lies of conspiracy fanatics.

The reason these fearful, paranoid, ignorant conspiracy freaks are in a frenzy and frenetically shouting down this information, is because it exposes their lies and disinformation tactics.   

They don?t want you see it.  They are afraid of being exposed.

Get this release, watch it and see how conspiracy charlatans, like religious tricksters, lie, promote hoaxes, fabricate and distort facts and evidence with their smoke and mirrors deceptions.    

You will quickly realise these virulent fanatics are the very things they viciously accuse the U.S. and its American citizens of.   

Take a peek and see what conspiracy zealots are trying to cover-up and keep you from finding out folks!"
,Sovare,2007-01-27T00:39Z,And no reply to my PMs. Wankers.

,Atrossity,2007-08-14T01:15Z,"I've got a friend who saw loose change and is now telling everyone about it.  He's turned into one of the 9-11 conspiracy nuts and this distresses me as I feel he's making himself look like a nut.  So I want to get this, burn it and watch it with him in hopes of setting him straight.  He should know better but as a big time stoner, well, you know how that goes.  I'll also show him South Park's urinal turd episode and maybe afterwards we can be on the same page.  I personally hate bush and the neo cons, but fringe idiot conspiracy groups just make liberals like me look bad.  Thanks so much for the up!  Please seed after you dl this and help spread the sanity.  For all you conspiracy nuts, how can you believe that the most incompatant admin in modern times could pulll off the most well orchestrated secret project since the atom bomb, and more importantly, how the hell could they have kept it secret when so many people would have known about it?  The CIA has a joke among it's agents, ""I'm going to tell you a secret and I don't want you to tell anyone...but when you do, I want you to tell them not to tell anyone.""  Stop making liberals look silly with your efforts and instead help a good candidate get elected.  "
,thedude2007,2008-02-06T20:34Z,"Sovare: AVI files can spread viruses and trojans because, while they are not executable programs, a security flaw in the player application can allow malicious code in the file to be executed.

Viruses have also been spread by JPEG files (in fact, Microsoft acknowledged this and issued a security patch a few months ago), and many other file types.

The worst thing you can do to your PCs security is think ""It's only an ...., I'll be fine"".

Having said that, viruses on TPB are *extremely* rare."
