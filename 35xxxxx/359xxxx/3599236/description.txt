This is a counter-video of the famous "Loose Change 2nd Edition". Using their own video and words, "Screw Loose Change" debunks the theories and statements made in Loose Change 2nd Edition. This new edition features urls to sources, less bitching, and longer rebuttals. NOTE: I apologize for some areas of the film having poor grammar and spelling. I did not proof read this as I wanted this displayed before 9/11/06. You can read a written document of mine, "Frequetly Stupid Theories", that cites the same sources and goes into a greater description of the claims made in Loose Change and other 9/11 theories.
