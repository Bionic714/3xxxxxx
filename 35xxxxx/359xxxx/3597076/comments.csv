,metalsanaz,2007-01-24T17:44Z,"The movie takes place in South Africa during the Apertheid-era where the white minority is controlling the nation's natural resources and the black majority is trying to break free from the chains of this oppressive regime. Some black groups are organizing terrorist activities against the regime, blowing up factories, railroads, etc. Of course, the question is, if you are fighting against an oppressive regime that is controlling your country, should your fighting be considered an act of terror? I really liked the angle the movie takes in this very important question. Our hero, Patrick (Derek Luke) is actually an innocent man but subjected to terror of torture in the hands of the chief of anti-terror squad, Nic Vos (Tim Robbins). The movie does a good way of showing that government officials are just as capable of committing terror as the people it accuses of being a terrorist. Once Patrick's life is shattered, he has nothing to lose, so he joins the resistance forces. After that, it is a chase and run between Patrick and Nic. The movie nicely connects the story of Patrick to the end of the Apertheid regime, when blacks finally take control of their country. This is a must see movie for everyone who is interested in political conflicts and terrorism."
