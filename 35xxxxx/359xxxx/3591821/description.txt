The eldest son in a prominent mobster family falls in love with a beautiful woman who's a dead ringer for his long-lost first love. One problem: she also happens to be a tough-as-nails criminal prosecutor with a knack for putting gangsters behind bars. Silly and tonally somewhat of a mess, Marrying the Mafia 2 is by far a more entertaining film than it has any right to be. It's fun, but let's be clear: it's fast food entertainment, no more, no less.
