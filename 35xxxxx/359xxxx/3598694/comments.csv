,zen-TAO,2009-07-16T05:34Z,"At last!
It did take 40 hours to DL.
I found - what i hope - the
right subs at Open.Subs.

Thanks!
"
,hellonewman,2009-10-19T10:06Z,"Hey Zen
Any chance you can document how to put those sub-titles you found into the avi I uploaded? 

I wonder if, with the subtitles, they will mix in with good timing to an avi file, like mine, that have been played around with. 

Hope I am wrong, because I am missing out on a lot of non English movies. "
,hellonewman,2009-11-21T07:37Z,"Argyle. The 15 minutes probably the commercial breaks taken out. 
Duh! Duh! Duh!

I've watched this mini series every year since I uploaded it 3 years ago. Nothing is missing."
,puppyup,2011-02-16T18:04Z,"Picture quality of this torrent is significantly better than the 2Lions release. Thanks!

Open new tab and manually copy/paste link into address bar to get to imageshack, otherwise you'll get a 403 error. Imageshack blocks TPB referers."
,puppyup,2011-02-16T18:10Z,Forget my comments. I guess I mixed up this release with another.
,akhnaten,2011-07-07T23:40Z,"ANY idea on where to find English subs just for the Sioux parts?  Or at least a list of times so I can take out a majority of English, since I speak it, in TMPGENC?"
,Thejohndoemofo,2012-03-04T02:38Z,"This is low quality TV rip with an annoying logo throughout the show.
