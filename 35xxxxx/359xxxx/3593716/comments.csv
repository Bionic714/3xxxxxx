The episode number should be 3x17, but the order of showing of the episodes changed in the middle of season, so this is ACTUALLY 3x16 - that's the reason i called it [3x17] {3x16}

So, if the next episode will be ""Sunday""

I will call it 
""Stargate Atlantis [3x18] {3x14} Sunday (X264 DJS) EnglishV"
