,made-of-technetium,2007-01-08T17:38Z,If you hadn't archived it people who have already downloaded your first torrent could have just downloaded the missing files
,speakeasy,2007-01-10T00:32Z,@pqt - stats here at TPB are unreliable; your client will give accurate info.
,Aga1980,2007-01-10T15:58Z,"No seeding...
After second try from Straticus...

Bad, bad bad. Downloaded first try complete.
Now he stops...

Tsssss......"
,Straticus,2007-01-10T17:08Z,I AM seeding...I've been seeding this thing for 3 damn days...don't tell me I'm not when I am :)
,Aga1980,2007-01-11T14:25Z,"15 peers all stuck on 45%... maybe you're seeding, but are you actually uploading?

You should have followed my advice btw: just a torrent for the missing files from your first try...

Now folks have to start all over...

But thanks for your efforts!"
,Aga1980,2007-01-13T09:41Z,I guess this the end for this 'world premiere'?
,Straticus,2007-01-13T11:59Z,"Not a chance...I intend to make this work...according to my console, I AM seeding it and I'm showing upload speeds of 50 - 75kb/s...I'm eager for everyone to get this, and I'll do whatever I need to do to make sure it happens...let me know what I need to do!

,Aga1980,2007-01-15T19:24Z,"I give up...

Please post a whole new torrent..."
,Aga1980,2007-01-17T06:48Z,"Seeders - Leechers: 0 - 0

What a waste of time and bandwidth..."
