INTERNET VIDEO POWER HOUR!

This is a video power hour made up of (approximately) one minute clips from Internet videos and flash animations.  Every time the video switches, drink!

It includes a wide range of different types of videos from the different "eras" of Internet video: the Flash animation days, the eBaumsWorld / comedy video site days, and the YouTube / Google Videos trend of today.  I tried to include the most famous and significant videos of all time, along with a few of my favorites.
