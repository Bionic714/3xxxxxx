,quatrone,2008-11-01T23:13Z,"this torrent seems to be a poison for everybody who take it.

so much hash ""failed hash check""..
so much ""Wasted"" megabytes...

every 100mb i have ~ 10mb wasted with over 20 hashfails ...
so calculate... this is having ~500mb... so, you will have ~50mb wasted with over 100 hashfails :|"
