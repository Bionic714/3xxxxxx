My first rip. Video is not resized and excellent H.264 encoding is used. This means it is anamorphic and should be viewed as 16:9 (vlc player displays correctly the 16:9 DAR value). Audio is 192kbps, untouched.

If, and only IF, people likes this rip I may offer more episodes of Season 1.

Enjoy Scottish scenery and marvelous characters like Hector, played by Richard Briers -- a renowned Shakespeare actor.
