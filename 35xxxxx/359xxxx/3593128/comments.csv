,nzsmostwantd,2007-11-27T11:28Z,"I have downloaded,installed,and ran many versions,be they  cracked,or with keygen or serial,and always have trouble updating on a regular basis...Because if you use another's name & serial,soon spydoctor checks out who u r logged in/on the PC and if it doesnt match the name spy dr's registered to,it WONT update.You'll find the info inside Spy dr..'about'...under registration...So has any 1 got a cracked version that actually works and updates with no warning messages??"
