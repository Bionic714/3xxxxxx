Release Notes:

Madonna's record breaking Confessions Tour filmed at London's Wembley
Arena during her worldwide sold-out 25-City run in 2006 is scheduled
to be released as a DVD/CD on sale January 30th.

The highest-grossing tour ever by a female artist, "The Confessions
Tour - Live from London" DVD, first broadcast on NBC last November,
includes songs that span the course of Madonna's extraordinary career.
"Like A Virgin," "Hung Up," "Erotica" and "Music" are just a few of
the hits that can be seen on the DVD and heard on the bonus CD
included in the package as well as several songs from her "Confessions
On A Dance Floor" CD which debuted at No. 1 in 29 countries. In
addition, "The Confessions Tour" DVD includes bonus footage, which did
not appear on the broadcast, including Madonna's early classic hit
"Lucky Star" as well as the full unedited version of the controversial
performance of "Live To Tell." The "Confessions" DVD will have never
before seen rehearsal footage and a unique photo gallery. The DVD was
directed by Jonus Akerlund. The show was directed for the stage by
Jamie King. Musical Director was Stuart Price.

"The pop spectacle of the year -- a politically charged combination of
Cirque du Soleil, performance-art commentary and dance party explosion
that more or less sums up everything she has been striving to say and
show this decade... it's quite possibly the best production she's ever
concocted," raved the Orange County Register in their review of
Madonna's show.

"I want to turn the world into one big dance floor," claimed the
Material Girl when The Confessions Tour began. Now, the singer,
songwriter, video visionary, designer, producer, children's book
author and artist, who has enthralled millions of fans all over the
world and has sold 200 million plus CDs, is extending that commitment
to the living rooms of the world.
