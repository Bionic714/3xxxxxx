,pether,2007-01-17T01:03Z,You do know that you can play any version on your modded ps2?
,gman1964,2007-01-17T03:31Z,The PAL version would not work as I do not have a PAL television.  I tried to use the PAL to NTSC conversion tool but it would not work either. So....  Here is a new torrent. I would like comments on the torrent and any clues to make it better.
,jennysalala,2007-01-17T07:24Z,"For hard drive users, to conserve space this game is shrinkable from a 4.4gig iso to a 1.9gig iso: http://www.ps2hd.com/forums/faq.php?faq=dvdshrink

:)"
,begone77,2007-01-17T14:49Z,"yes i tried the conversion tool also, I thank you VARY much for this!"
,pether,2007-01-17T18:51Z,Hmm. I have a PAL PS2+TV and almost all games i download are NTSC. SO i dont know why it would be any problem going the other way?
,begone77,2007-01-17T21:30Z,"oh I know, I download some pal games too, but for some reason this game is just weird,  who care anyways? this nice guy uploaded the one I need, and i thank him for it"
