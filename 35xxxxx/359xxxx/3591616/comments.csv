any proof to what your saying? 




what do you think kerry would have done for our country? welfare reform...? 


please get your head out your ass and stop watching micheal moore movies.. 


ask any troop that comes back from iraq.. they will be shocked when they turn on and all they show is the death in iraq. 


they never show the positives. 


terrorism kills roughly 300? 


did everyone just forget about september 11th? 


i think so. 


these people are trying to kill us and your family but you sit back and just give them more ammo for there guns. 


pathetic. 


you people are anti american./ 



have fun watching cnn and msnbc 


and reading the washington post 




if yoiu dont know the economy is BOOMING in iraq.. everything is up. the people in iraq been killing eachother for years hundreds of years. its there religion. why dont you research a little before you start posting your liberal crap and a view that noone wants to hear. another thing. u say they kill roughly 300. what about our troops that died? they werent killed by terrorists tho right? got another movie to defend that statement? 


stop posting pure rhetoric and your own ""chaotic"" views and start getting some cold hearted facts."
,tbot101,2007-01-09T05:28Z,"i recently watched a movie entitled: islam: what the west needs to know.  Islam has always been an elusive religion to me, after watching the film i wondered more about the intentions of all these religious types, be it: christian, muslim, jewish etc....where are our loyalties i ask? to what we are conditioned, by family race, status, etc.. or to our own selves and minds and opinions?  being an american i do realize the temptation to aggravate quickly, ""jump the gun"" spend, spend, spend. and all that capitalistic jargon, but i also see the world and see all of the other styles of thought and life, i am intrigued by the rest of the world and it is strange to watch the culture cleansing that is happening all over the world in the name of business.  and really thats all it is, if any other country had the chance they would be the head honcho..i guess my point is that i know for a fact there are tons of people all over the planet that are more advanced than this primitive attempt to be ""king of the planet""  regardless of where they were sculpted by their surroundings, its time to break the frickin' molds, correct these inefficient patterns of destruction and begin applying the physics of harmony to the power of unity.   oh yea this movie any good? hope there are seeders..."
,intheb0x,2007-01-14T06:54Z,"you still dont answer my question
where do you get 650,000 from?
any proof to that number?
i think not.

also dont you remember saddam NOT letting weapons inspectors come in to look.
what was there to hide?

did you forget about the russians coming in there right before the war happened..
?
im sure thats where the wmds went.
when you have every intelligence agency in the
world telling you he has them what would you do?

but no one ever brings up the nerve agents found and such. those arent big weapons right?

you talk about us having nuclear weapons.
SO WHAT?
god knows we arent going to use them
but take IRAN for example
you want him to have NUCLEAR weapons so he can WIPE ISREAL off the map as he said NUMEROUS amounts of time.

that arguement is garbage talking about us having wmds but they dont.

keep your crap rheroric to yourself.

also whats so bad about fox news?
are you mad its the only news agency that shows BOTH sides of the story and not your sorry pathetic side?

dont even bring up how we killed a few innocent people and how the soliders died. since when do we worry about causalties of a war before going in? theres always more casulties.

what about the murder rate in some citys in the us? alot higher then that.
come on

its not my problem clinton was a pushover for saddam.. u know clinton and his STRONG WORDED LETTERS really showed how strong the US was..


alot of the people in iraq have been killing eachother for many many years. its there religon. thats how it works for them.

you say thats half the world hates bush.
who cares?
honestly answer that question.

the terrorists are mad that they cant plan and follow through on attacks in the US anymore.
there mad that we are in iraq and blowing them up. you guys support the terrorists.
point blank.

stop talkin about how it was wrong how we went into iraq.
it happened we did it your side voted for it.
we cant just pull out now.
ask any troop what they think.
they will tell you we have to stay. ask any troop that comes back over here and turns on the tv.

they wont believe the negativity they see on tv. the anti american views all over tv.
ask them seriously they will tell you about the good things going on there.

you know before saddam like 10% had cellphones. now that went up to what? 80%.
the pay increases and the job rate is going up and up.
dont forget about the iraqis voting.
they just did that for no reason tho right?

you guys won stop being so angry all the time
lol

now pull us out of iraq and make the us look soft. make iran laugh at us more.. you know like you guys said we need to TALK to iran and syria.. they will tell us what to do right???????????do something better for the country like welfare reform and public health care
lmfao!"

What about humanitarian issues?  $400 billion spent, and they still have no clean drinking water; hmmm.  I love that country called america, but i hate it's foreign policies.
