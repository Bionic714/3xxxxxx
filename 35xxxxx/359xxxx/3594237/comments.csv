,Jane136,2007-01-17T05:21Z,"Video quality excellent. Pretty girl. She speaks with a cute Asian accent, and she's good at sex. The guy assumes he will have to bounce her up and down on top of him when doing cowgirl, but she turns out to be a pro at it and can bounce herself up and down on him like she's riding a wild pony. (no anal)"

,yodakun,2010-05-10T23:05Z,"ROFL... good sense of humor gnice06. Love your torrents btw, thanks! :P

@scotty69: most people want screens to legitimize the torrent, and also some others have bandwidth quotas which they cannot exceed so they like to know if it's worth the download before wasting their bandwidth. Fortunately, I don't have that problem, woot!"
