,jennifer1994,2007-01-16T08:54Z,There is no virus! I have scanned this with NOD32 and Symantec. Why would you even say that? What virus do you detect and with what software?
,jennifer1994,2007-01-16T10:29Z,"you are a mean person to say such things. I have gotten this on usenet and certainly wouldnt seed it if I thought it was infected. If it is infected, then I am infected, as I have run it on my own PC, to fix the WGA. I will scan it again in 2 days, and update my virus signatures as you say."

,NWE,2007-01-16T17:47Z,"Babe Zuk-Zuk : So this was Yet another spam-attack by the confused virus/trojan/porn spammer.
They're trying to confuse us by telling there are viruses and telling us that there are NO viruses in the comments. Who cares? Download and see for yourself if your antivirus reports!

BSA/MPAA/RIAA/whoever anti-piracy (spammer) tactic:
> Upload appz with virus
> Spam TPB appz comments with false ""virus/trojan warnings"" and fake and perverted statements.
> Using the names of genuine and sincere uploaders, to fool the masses. (thnx gomzi)

Will it succeed? Hmm... At least I download and my antivirus checks, as usual. It is rather pathetic after all..  (and, yes.. i'm aware of the spam-irony :)"
,bacspasm,2007-01-18T05:21Z,did not work for me.  My NOD 32 did not find virus in this file
