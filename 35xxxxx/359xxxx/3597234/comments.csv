,vivatpb5776,2011-03-27T19:29Z,"Okay, where to begin with this download:

- In the beginning of the video file, there is a disclaimer referencing that, ""Piracy is Illegal. This copy is for the recipient only. Not to be sold, copied, or given away...""

- Following the above is the FBI Anti-Piracy warning that is common on all DVD and Blu-Ray releases.

- Following the above is a ""Special Awards Viewing"" message from Universal Studios, Inc.

- Finally, 35 seconds after the beginning of the video file, the movie starts.

- The screen resolution is ridiculous. 720*576; however, if one goes to full screen, the movie sits dead in the middle of the screen with a thick black border around each edge of the viewing area.

- The audio is dull and distorted.

I would advise anyone to stay away from this download. There are way too many other viable options."
