,k1id,2007-03-12T23:13Z,Will this work on PSP?
,frijolito,2007-04-11T01:08Z,"About the PSP thing: I realize that this, being most likely MP4 video, will probably not play on anything without itunes/quicktime. But is there a way for PSP users to enjoy video released for iPods?

The thing is, there is a lot more video out there for iPods than for PSPs. This is easily confirmed by taking a quick look for yourself; and of course, it's only because, well, many more people have iPods than PSPs (and a lucky few have both).

Is there a way to help keep us PSP users not too out of the loop?"
