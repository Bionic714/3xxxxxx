,agentshags,2007-01-11T16:28Z,"This is a ""RE-RELEASE"", lol. The first time I uploaded this it was just the install file (no keygen).

Everyone thank BALLSADRAGIN over @ Demonoid for changing that.

ENJOY THIS [RE]RELEASE!"
,agentshags,2007-01-11T23:25Z,"Please be patient with the download, I know it is going slow, but all I have is a DSL connection that I share with my house mates. As of now I have  a 1.4 and climbing share ratio. Oh shit, i just realized I was seeding some other completed torrents, I just turned those off. Only seeding ATOMIC CANNON now. Thanks for the patience. "
,agentshags,2007-01-12T05:47Z,"So, downloaded 18 times, what do you think? Better than last time? Response?"
,agentshags,2007-01-13T21:16Z,60 times! Everyones copy working fine?
,ripture,2007-01-14T07:12Z,Haha.  A poster who actually cares about his torrent!  Don't see that much.  When I download it I'll repost with how it went if it matters.
,ripture,2007-01-14T07:22Z,":/.  It installed and ran fine the first time, then when I go to put the key in, it didn't necessarily go away like it was fine with the key, yet no error messages.  Didn't really know what was goin on so I put in another key and was like ok I guess it works now.  Closed out of the register windows and it goes to fatal error.  Uninstalling and reinstalling doesn't help.  It wont even go to the register part, it just fatal errors when it tries to run.  Bummer."
,Electrisis,2007-02-04T17:47Z,So... ripture... I've got the problem's solve! :) you need to clear all of the registry writings(all isotop244)... and after that register the program! and it's fully working!!!  :):):) sorry my bad english i'm from hun
,linktim,2007-02-14T00:47Z,"im  n00b for torrents so i can;t quite figure out how to properly USE they keygen. No idea. Prefer CRacKs, lol"

,laca0224,2007-03-04T16:30Z,"ez egy nagyon jó játék
nekem legalább is tetszik :D"
,jj626,2007-04-12T02:26Z,"i did what u said electrisis i deleted the registry file, but now it says ""the license for this software wasn't found. please reinstall."" but i tryed and i keep getting this message. please help me!"
,OOPIUMINAH,2007-05-19T12:33Z,"Gooddamn, this doesn't work.
Says something like ""Fatal program error, file ""somethingsomething.dmb(or smthing)"" was created. Contact isotope etc.etc.""
FUCK"
,a54932,2007-08-01T03:15Z,"it doesn't matter what I put in for registration ID, I get invalid reg ID... ? any help?"
,ichrisi,2007-08-12T07:15Z,"It doesn't work for me.  I'm following the instructions; I go to Register Offline, I copy the PC-### number to the keygen, Generate, copy the result back.  It accepts it and tells me it's valid, but when I close the registration window (when it tries to run atomic.exe) it gives me the following error:

A fatal program error has occured, the file ""C:\Program Files\Atomic Cannon\atomic.exe Crash Report.dmp"" has been created which contains details about the program error and will allow us to debug and fix the problem.  Please email this file to support@isotope244.com.  We will treat this report as confidential and anonymous.

""atomic.exe Crash Report.dmp"" references some DLLs, including various ones in system32 and Atomic Cannon's fmod.dll.  It's got a lot of binary data too.  I can send it to you if it'd help.  Uh, you can reach me at 2007aug.to.ichrisi@dfgh.net - it's a temporary email, but it'll get to me.  I'd really like to get this game working."
,blackiefm,2007-08-20T04:18Z,ichrisi did u get it working 
,ichrisi,2007-08-20T18:02Z,blackiefm: Nope.  I tried it on my computer and my father's.  Same results on both.  No word from agentshags yet either.
,pilatuspilot,2007-10-06T04:50Z,"Back in the old days of DOS only I logged into Compuserve (just before the devil, in the guise of Steve Case and AOL, opened the internet for any moron with more than 2 working fingers) I downloaded & played a game similar to this. I must have played that ""atomic bomberman""-type game a billion times.
This one looks like fun, and its got COLOR.
Thanks so much."
,agentshags,2007-12-18T12:17Z,"I am sorry that some people cannot get this game to work. If you have problems, try clearing the registry, and re-installing without your internet plugged in. I wish I had a crack for it, all I found was a keygen. I actually PAID for the game because I couldn't find it for windows anywhere!

TRY INSTALLING WITHOUT THE INTERNET PLUGGED IN!"
,vajpr37,2008-03-01T07:51Z,"Working!!! If you see ""A fatal program error has occured....."" you must try new registration. Run ucareg.exe from Atomic Cannon folder and try another serial number. For me 6th attempt was working... Ofcourse choose ""Register Offline"" and overwrite previous registration. ;-)"
,jvezirian,2008-03-20T04:58Z,"So where is the Keygen for this?????? Says there 3 files to be contained in this download, but it only contains 2 files"
,agentshags,2008-03-22T00:06Z,should be there.
,greentyrant2,2008-05-21T21:26Z,"it took me like 23 diffrent keys to register it.

if it doesent work after 25 or so keys i would suggest doing the following to clean the registry:
go to run type cmd,
then in cmd type regedit

in regedit drop down 
+Hkeylocalmachine
then
+software
then
+hkey local machine
and finally
+isatope graphics

just deleat the isatope graphics reg and try another key

-Good luck-

*it does work, just takes up ... alot of time*"
,greentyrant2,2008-05-21T21:27Z,"Ignore the second hkeylocal machine... My bad, lost track of where i was writing"
,Metal_Monkey,2008-09-27T15:04Z,says i cant delete that reg.. and the programs not open
,Metal_Monkey,2008-09-27T15:06Z,"GOT IT!!! 

All i did was continue entering in reg codes...

hope that helps"
,logon_saral,2008-10-17T15:10Z,"1.press The generate key & put the key in offline mode.......

repeat the process 1 untill it will regisred...

at a time it will register......."
,kingBosko,2009-01-25T14:10Z,"works!

all i must do is to register again and owerrite*** the registration and try to start the game again if the fatal error appear again register the game again....


after registrations the must work


sorry for my bad english


i hope this info works"
,EaglesGod5,2009-02-01T04:47Z,"Agentshags, hope you can help me out a bit.  I've tried a bunch of times to get it to work, creating new codes and they still don't work.  After I open up the ucareg and try to put in the code in the ""Register Offline"" section,  do I click YES or NO to the all users option?  (If that even matters)  Then, once I'm done, I just click YES to overwrite the old one, then OK when it says its accepted?  Then after that, do I just keep trying until it finally lets me play or what?  Really want to play this game, the two hour demo is awesome."
,EaglesGod5,2009-02-01T07:23Z,"Never mind guys, I had to generate 30+ keys before it finally started.  Thanks a lot agent, very nice game.

To anyone who is still having problems:

Just keep generating new keys and pasting them in the ""Register Offline"" key part, paste the whole thing in there too, ex: PC-AC-cd24-0284-f699-0a9b-948f-89c4-0654-f669, and click REGISTER, then YES, then OK and double click your shortcut on desktop.  If it works, then just close out everything and play the game.  If not, keep generating and pasting and clicking the shortcut until it works.  Eventually, it will."
,eriche5,2009-03-12T21:56Z,i keep getting a fatal error when i try to start game. any way i can fix this?
,eriche5,2009-03-13T04:00Z,just wanted to say i got it workin. thanks for the upload. works great!
,JKL998,2009-04-11T21:00Z,i think i know how to get it fast working just register 3 times whitout starting the game or just do at least 20 registerings

,SCLEMTAK,2009-06-13T21:27Z,YES!!! Working at last!..Took 39 keycodes!!..Well worth the time.this game is AWESOME!!!!.Just like Scorched Tanks on the Amiga.
,Marsmallos,2009-07-17T18:24Z,"WHY THE FUCK DO PEOPLE PUT UP TORRENTS WITH STUFF THAT DOESN'T WORK? So I installed it, then I sat on my ass and generated keys for like 30 min, then I tried the suggestion to clear all registry entries but now nothing works, not reinstalling nothing, it says that there is no licence and that it needs to be reinstalled but I've tried that several times now can't just somebody make a crack for gods sake"
,riccofox96,2010-10-03T17:14Z,"Good torrent. Unfortunately you have to spend a long time trying to register it, but it is worth it. I got it on my first try, which surprised me. "
,radik4li,2011-01-23T23:37Z,"The key-gen is a virus ,dont download. I have nod32 antivirus."
