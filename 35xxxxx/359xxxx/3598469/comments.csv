HELP... 

This is my favorite film of all time and i keep gettin the above msg when i try to download.
First and only time ever."
,DogNo7,2008-01-23T08:02Z,"Sounds like you are having problems between your browser and your bittorrent client.  Get Azureus or some other bittorrent client, and associate the .torrent extension with your bittorrent client.  Another way of doing this, if you are in explorer, is instead of downloading the file, open it.  This will work if you have bittorrent client (such as azureus) installed."
,DogNo7,2008-01-23T08:04Z,"This was actually a smidge of a tricky rip, as the initial attempts all resulted in a sound skew.

This has perfect ac3 sound, and about 70% (my guess) picture compression."
,DogNo7,2008-01-23T08:07Z,"I should have also commented that this is one of my favorite films, and I have watched it probably 30-50 times so far.

It was what got me interested in smoking pot and drinking when I was in High School, a few years later.
