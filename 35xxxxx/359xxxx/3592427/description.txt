   HOW TO MAKE XBMC YOUR DASHBOARD:

   A configurable Shortcut for your -C-Drive is included in the ROOT dir.
   It points to E:/Apps/XBMC/default.xbe by default. If your XBMC Directory is
   elsewhere you must change its Application Path by editing the .cfg file !! 
   Rename the "ShortCut for -C-Drive.cfg" and the "ShortCut for -C-Drive.xbe" to
   something your BIOS can boot (evoxdash.xbe + evoxdash.cfg) + copy both files to
   your -C-Drive. !! Double check !! you did everything right then reboot - Voila !

   RELEASE NOTES:

   For those of you who are bored - This Release includes 3 additional Skins:
   Blackbolt Classic (SVN Revision 203)
   Clearity (SVN Revision 221)
   P.D.M. (SVN Revision 188)
   Thanks to the Authors of these beautiful Skins for their hard work ! 
   These won┬┤t be included in future Releases, if you like them don┬┤t delete them !

   Finally took the time to recheck all Scripts. Removed the following as they are
   not working anymore: GameSaves / XBMC Changelog / XBMC Lyrics
   If fixed versions of these Scripts show up, i might integrate these again.

   They started the huge job of auditing all scripts on www.xbmcscripts.com
   So if you install Scripts via the XBMCScripts Installer now - chances get
   better every day, that you┬┤ll get Scripts that actually work ...

   You can find the complete Changelogs in /docs/Changelog.txt.

   2007-01-08  7544  fixed: Groups with no <height> inherited the incorrect
                            height from their parent.
   2007-01-08  7537  updated: norwegian language file (thanks to vnm)
   2007-01-08  7536  changed: since tinyxml "now" supports cdata tags, remove the

                              more feeds should work now.
