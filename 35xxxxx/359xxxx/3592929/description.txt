In this film, muckraker Michael Moore turns his eye on George
W. Bush and his War on Terrorism agenda. He illustrates his
argument about how this failed businessman with deep
connections to the royal house of Saud of Saudia Arabia and
the Bin Ladins got elected on fraudulent circumstances and
proceeded to blunder through his duties while ignoring
warnings of the looming betrayal by his foreign partners.
When that treachery hits with the 9/11 attacks, Moore
explains how Bush failed to take immediate action to defend
his nation, only to later cynically manipulate it to serve
his wealthy backers' corrupt ambitions. Through facts,
footage and interviews, Moore illustrates his contention of
how Bush and his cronies have gotten America into worse
trouble than ever before and why Americans should not stand
for it.
