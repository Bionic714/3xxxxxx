,death734,2007-01-19T00:34Z,would of uploader this morning but i had to get some WMI issues fixed first so that i could get my ports fowarded properly
,death734,2007-01-19T01:37Z,"2 Questions...
1- is there any way to edit the description? 3rd line says XviD-D74 and should say XviD-D734
2- any idea when this site will show the actual tracker stats? I'm seeding with ports forwarded (i checked with utorrents page and it says ok, using tracker given from upload page, using utorrent, and i can see in the peers list that I'm seeding to leechers"

,vikhr,2008-03-21T08:44Z,"From this entry of Future weapons onwards..there is no description..some of episodes r crappy with that bald guy's terrible chit-chat..i hate that guy..luvs just the weapons..he is just too over-dramatic at times..that might b the reason he was hired..anyway..

And..people hav tastes like i am fond of mostly small arms and artilary..so please please please include a description in all the entries on wat the particular episodes deals with...
GREAT WORK AnYWAY.."
