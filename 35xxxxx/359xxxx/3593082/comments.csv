,JohnyFiama,2007-01-10T18:57Z,"No offence, but this is *NOT* version 2.70.25. The program's version number *IS* 2.70.23, which is the latest version for the NOD32 Standard English applications. I think you have confused this with the NOD32 English Administrator Version, whose latest version number is 2.70.25. Well, I'm not talking about the NOD32 Remote Admin Client/Server applications but rather the regular administrator version, to eliminate all confusions.

,JohnyFiama,2007-01-10T19:09Z,"Also wanted to confirm that this torrent *DOES NOT* contain any malware. FYI: I used the latest AVG Anti-Spyware together with the latest NOD32 (with custom-made configurations for maximal protection), all using the latest signatures, to scan this torrent. So, it is 100% clean, from my point of view! :) The reason I'm pointing this out is because I'm sick and tired of spammers who say ""trojan"" or ""virus"".

,master breeze,2007-01-10T20:05Z,"works on vista, tanks for sharing. Its a shame with all the noobs crying on tpb about virus and such, get a life and stop spamming good torrents"
,sivan_mezoo,2007-01-19T10:50Z,"I think there is a trojan in this reealse , it make a file by namne VIDPY.exe in windows\system32 
well i dont need why there is a file called nod32updateviwer ?! its that maybe , i used just pach , i installed another nod32 then used this pach just it and its clean , kaprofsky maybe showes this trojan win32.x but it cant remove it , if you pc i slow and hanging after this install just boot in mini xp (search) and then g책 delete this file ,woops every thing i normal again . i tested in two PCes ...."
,Vanguard,2007-02-03T14:12Z,I can't update the virus signature database anymore. Nod32 prompts for login and password to the server. Any suggestions?
,Programmer77,2007-02-03T15:44Z,sivan_mezoo: I agree with You conclusion. I downloaded this a few weeks ago and the computer it was installed on has been behaving just like You describes and today NOD32 found a virus...vidpy.exe. I managed to remove it but I will install a new version of NOD32 and follow You instructions. THANKS!
,maruseru,2007-02-12T13:05Z,"either you believe JohnyFlama (JF) or Sivan_Mezoo, but I downloaded this torrent, install it, and yes it installs also two files 'vidpy.dll' and 'vidpy.exe' into respectively WINDOWS\ and WINDOWS\System32.   Be careful with these two files as it hogs on your system resources (keyboard not responsive, clicks are not recognized, only Ctrl-Alt-Del works yet it does nothing).

My tip:
-. After installing, apply the fix, disable system restore, and restart in safe mode.
-. Go into Explorer, search for those two files, and totally delete (Shift-Del) them (use 'Unlocker' (google it) to unlock those files)
-. Clean recycle-bin
-. Restart into normal mode
-. Re-enable sysrestore

Note to JF: I am a living human being, not a spammer...screw spammers!"
