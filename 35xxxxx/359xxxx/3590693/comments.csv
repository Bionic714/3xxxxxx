,RavenX1957,2008-03-16T16:31Z,"Hi 	
Can someone please help me with one of the games in this torrent please. It is 7 wonders. In the instructions it say to replace the 7wondersers.dll file with the crack file. I have tried everything. If I delete old dll file the game won't play. If I copy it to the file where I downloaded it nothing happens either. I love this game and would really like to have the full version. Thanks,
RavenX"
