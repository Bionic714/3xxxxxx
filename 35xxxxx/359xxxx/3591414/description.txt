Great movie, about a terminally ill man who is preparing for his death right at the time his child is about to be born and ends up video-taping his life.

Saw this when it came out in 1993 and wanted to show my wife the movie... downloaded from eMule, but unfortunately the only version available is in ITALIAN! Still, uploading it for Italian speakers... worthless for me as I can't understand a word!

Thanks, and great site.
