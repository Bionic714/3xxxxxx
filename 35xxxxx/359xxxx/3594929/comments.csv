,shpilman,2007-04-25T09:39Z,It happened!!! But I can't run instalation process!
,nihilast,2007-05-22T12:35Z,"I think the uploader carelessly forgot to mention that this game only runs under Win95/98.
And i know this all too well, because i've had it installed from cd and played it many years ago.

And don't bother using the ""compatability mode"" in Xp, just won't work. :(
