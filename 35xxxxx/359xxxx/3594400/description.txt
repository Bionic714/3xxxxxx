The Doctor Who Cardiff Concert in MP3 Variable Format. I've given all the songs the correct ID3v1 and v2 tags and I've eliminated most of the applause on the music tracks. I've split the introduction sections off as well, giving each section with David Tennant talking is its own properly tagged MP3 Track (Including the Q&A Section).

I've split the concert up into 33 tracks for a total time of 1:28:00.

The tracks have been split along applauses and long silences. This way a greater selection of tracks are available, allowing you to skip from one section to another. All the tracks are of high quality and well cut. In some cases I've inserted silences in order to allow for it to run smoothly. All the tracks are formatted for easy listening on your computer or MP3 player. I hope you enjoy this rip.
