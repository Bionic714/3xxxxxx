,Dvdman_007,2007-01-07T18:23Z,"no, only fr and english subs"
,mathsped,2007-01-07T22:47Z,That's what I'd call a MultiSub release....NOT U dumb moron.
,eccles,2007-01-09T17:09Z,"Mathsped. Please think before flaming. Calling someone a dumb moron is hardly the way to thank uploaders and get them to upload more in future. If you don't like it, don't download it."
,Dvdman_007,2007-01-09T18:08Z,thanks
,spastiko_anemistiraki,2008-01-12T20:36Z,"it is wrong to call this multi sub. but it is also wrong to speak like that !
anyway on the details we can see: 
""""Subs..........: ENG / FR""""
it is clear for me."
,Clairwil,2008-06-06T17:55Z,Two subtitles and you call that multi? 
,Clairwil,2009-01-10T17:06Z,Multi-moron
