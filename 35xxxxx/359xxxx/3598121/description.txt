LAGO ROME Scenery

DESCRIPTION:

-New techniques to save frame-rates, a never seen territorial extension of the scenery, including Fiumicino, Ciampino and Urbe airports.
All the airports are highly detailed in 3D, extensive use of photo-realistic textures, for full integration of the airport with its surroundings.
