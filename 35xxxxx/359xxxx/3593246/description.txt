Today ive gotta this classic game to share with ya. Lara Croft in her first, considered by many as the best installment of Tomb Raider series. Cdaudio has been fixed, has custom backgrounds and icons and the whole game is compressed. So far it works flawless on Dark_Alex's Custom firmware 3.03 OE-B (YOU RULE MAN). 

Enjoy This Fine Release from me, shakkall :)
