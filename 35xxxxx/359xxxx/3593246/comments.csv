GreyfoxJP: I dunno, its working fine on my psp, almost finished it. You can try to check the torrent once again, maybe your download is corrupt :("

This is a bug with emulation from what i've read.
Basically, you need to get through the room without dying. Once you've done it, save outside, then exit and restart and all should be okay again, OR if you can do a level skip :)"
