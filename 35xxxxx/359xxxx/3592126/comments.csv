,SlimT,2008-06-14T21:45Z,"wow, this game realy suck, i got it and... well i love sims 1 & 2 but this is a totoaly diffrent sucky thing!"
,Funnybun,2008-08-03T06:41Z,"DonMajic, i'm not sure, but i used to have this problem. When you turn on your psp, hold L (if ur psp is slim) and R (if its fat) and a weird screen pops up, then just try to find a thing about UMD and change it to: Sony No_UMD or something along those lines"
,trigger101,2009-05-23T15:05Z,this game is suck... i suggest that dont ever download it... this is not an iso file and i will waste your time... 
,XDFace355,2010-07-06T15:12Z,"guys the thing is named PSP... we all know it can't fit a game like sims 2 on the computer. PSP can't support a good graphics thing... Just be happy there is something like a sims 2 & 1 game...

Try pressing SELECT and changing it to Sony SP or something with sony in it. Then get out of the menu.
im running on 4.01 M33-2!

,mndi89,2010-08-03T21:08Z,"i found out a way of making this game work, you would need PSP ISO Compresser, download it from this link "" http://www.psp-hacks.com/file/900 "". start it up and convert it from CSO to ISO. the file size would be 20MB bigger than the CSO. put the game in the ISO folder on your memory stick. you should now be able to play it on your psp.
worked on my PSP Phat version 5.50 gen D3"
,blazingscore004,2011-12-24T05:34Z,"mndi89 is right...
Use a CSO >> ISO converter for the game, it will work.
I tried it with my Patapon 2 last time, at first, when it is a CSO file, it corrupts at the middle stages, but when I converted it to ISO, it doesn't corrupt anymore and it reached the final level...
Using the converter is the best solution for your probs..."
