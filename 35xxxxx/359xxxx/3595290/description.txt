Big Country were one of the few truly
awesome live outfits to have survived
the roller coaster ride of the mad
Eighties and come through wiser andstronger.Their star burning brighter
than ever.
In may 200 the band embarked on their
"final fling" tour of the UK. they had
never sounded so good and the audience
as fervent as ever. This concert is the
final date of the tour at their spiritual home of glasgow┬┤s Barrowlands.
