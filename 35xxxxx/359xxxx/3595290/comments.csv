,microchip,2007-01-15T20:20Z,veery slow download speed :-(
,lilllgud,2007-01-15T22:53Z,Yeah with 85 people connecting my computer thereÂ´s a little bit of slowing down and then add my 41 other torrents dowloading at the same time... U understand now why u think it is to slow for U???
,microchip,2007-01-15T22:59Z,I hope you use the special type of seed that i don't currently remember the name of but it makes shure that noone gets the same part
,lilllgud,2007-01-16T13:54Z,Yes. IÂ´m using super seeding.
,madjock56R,2007-01-19T11:28Z,Thanks again for another great up mate.
,lilllgud,2007-01-19T20:25Z,"Downloaded 33 times and after less then 24H there is only 7 seeders left..
No I will not put up any more of my Big Country stuff!!!"
,madjock56R,2007-01-20T17:00Z,"Okay mate your call.

Thanks very much for the 2 you have put up.

Remember people will get this torrent from search sites, so they dont care how much effort goes into it.

Thanks again."
,ronaldl,2007-03-21T23:04Z,"Come on now and stop this ""hit and run"" on torrents, don't you understand you have to seed too? Too many torrents will die too early when you can't stay online and seed. It's obvioulsy ok to stay online to download..."
,makingcookies,2007-07-04T11:39Z,Is this only disc 2? The label says so..
