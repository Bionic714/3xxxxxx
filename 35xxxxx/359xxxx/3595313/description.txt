On-the-road documentary following a party of teenagers from the Tourette Scotland support group as they make their way to France on a Routemaster bus. The group's goal is to visit the Sal Petrier Hospital in Paris, to see for themselves the place where their condition was first diagnosed. Keith Allen joins up with the youths to discover what daily life is like for ordinary people with uncontrollable tics, who often break society's taboos by inadvertently shouting obscene words.
