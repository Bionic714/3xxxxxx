[V],NorseGuy,2007-01-18T18:10Z,"'Wheels on Meals' doesn't lack the ending as claimed above.

However, many of the movies lack english audio, whereas two of these lack english subtitles as well ('Winners and Sinners' and 'New Police Story').

Also too many movies seem to have been encoded years ago when people didn't know how to encode with good enough quality (meaning some movies are quite blurry, no cropping etc. But personally I am a bit afraid that several of the movies may not be compatible with the stationary divx player, as I noticed when checking the movies on VLC player, the picture on several movies 'dissolves' for some seconds, before restoring itself. This often means that the movie won't play well on stationary divx players.

But all in all it's nice to be able to have a package of Jackie Chan movies like this one. Thanks haithamoda :-)"

,shiranami,2009-02-23T19:52Z,I've been seeding this from a computer at work but they will ask me to delete it eventually - so I'm here to ask YOU that when you've downloaded it KEEP SEEDING IT FOR THE OTHERS as this is a pretty good collection as they go. It's true that as someone else said they are not perfect encodes - but there's only one which is 'unwatchable' and that is accidental spy and I was able to bittorrent a much better version in its original language (the file in this torrent for that movie is dubbed) Unfortunately it's unlikely that any of the current leechers are going to come here and read this before they remove the torrent after its completion. There are 12 to 156 share ratio at the time of writing this which is out of whack if you ask me. It's not like it's a 50 gig torrent. I'm the only one seeding this evening as I write this (thanks to all those who were the only ones seeeding when I downloaded it!! As for any issues with the subs - just get em from subbiee.com or opensubtitles.org like I did. As I remember most of the movies in this torrent are dubs but some of them thankfully are in the original Cantonese. Enjoy. And SEEEEEEEEEEEEEEED :3
,Veedhu,2011-06-03T14:33Z,plese seed
