,goonz0r,2007-01-06T23:01Z,"This is fantastic! I hope you seed this long enough to finish it, If you do I'll continue to seed for a few weeks.

Is it PAL by any chance?"
,seej,2007-01-07T01:35Z,"hey goonz0r, yep this is PAL. I'll be seeding it for a few weeks. By then there should more than enough seeders."
,rambler,2007-01-07T09:32Z,"GREAT! Been looking for this one.

Hope we get enough seeders, as 13.1GB is alot of data. 

If the sharing fails due to the size (sorry but i seem to have a problem with big files), can you break it in episodes? "
,seej,2007-01-07T11:18Z,"Hey rambler. At the top of this listing there is a label, 'Files:', and clicking on the link next to it  - which shows 45, the number of files - will list all the files contained in this torrent. You should not have a problem with this torrent, because your client downloads and saves each of the 45 files individually - and each file is no larger than 1 GiB. In fact, some clients such as uTorrent will let you choose which files in the torrent to download and not to download."
,eminenz,2007-01-07T22:39Z,"this is a fantastic share, seej, i'm sending good vibes and hoping we make it!"
,VibeMerchant,2007-01-08T18:06Z,"Tnanx for the great download! Odly enough though, my ratio is going up daily, but I do not see any seeder (in u-torrent) active at any moment. Pirate Bay does list one active seed....So my download goes realy fast one moment, but as soon as it reaches the level of the 'highest' peer, it drops and I just go on uploading. Anyway, tnx, we'll see what happens!"
,seej,2007-01-08T18:37Z,"You can't 'see' my seed because I'm super-seeding/initial-seeding:

""Rather than claiming to have every piece from the outset, the seeder claims to have no pieces. As peers connect, the seed will inform a peer that it has received a new piece, one that has not yet been sent to any other peers. The seed then unchokes the peer and allows it to download the piece. The seed will not upload another piece to the same peer until the seed receives confirmation from other peers that the piece has been uploaded again."" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super-seeding"
,seej,2007-01-09T20:04Z,"A hard drive failed and I need to recover the files from a backup. I should be super seeding again within 12 hours, so hold on :]"
,ognev,2007-01-10T05:32Z, I am almost there so I certainly will hold on. Thanx for this piece of culture.
,seej,2007-01-10T15:17Z,..and we're back up.
,tobsy,2007-01-12T19:08Z,"This is really slow - hang in there seej, we are with you. dont give up. i really look forward to this one. i mentioned this download at work today, and everyone was like"" i want to see that as well"""
,hacklet,2007-01-14T17:22Z,"Oh lovely, I have been after this for a while. Hope y'all keep seeding for a while!"
,Sillburk,2007-01-18T18:43Z,"Seeda tack, har h책llt p책 ett bra tag med denna nu"
,seej,2007-01-18T19:44Z,"I am seeding, but because my torrent is set to 'initial seed' you won't see it as being completely available. Availability right now is 53%, but this is rising by about 5-10% every day. If people seed when they finish downloading, we should have about 600% availability soon."
,phr33,2007-01-22T12:55Z,"Big thanks for great seed!
Max is currently on 87.3% so I guess progress is as expected."
,technoel,2007-03-22T06:33Z,can someone seed this I'm kind of stuch and I love this show
,ektakrome,2007-05-23T07:38Z,"I've been checking out your link to the BBC, and this looks like i'm going to enjoy this very much, so I thank you and I just hope that these people that are downloading it will keep it available for others to share knowledge of the arts on here."
,PB_2006,2008-07-13T12:35Z,this multi-language (subs) or just english?? 
,seej,2008-08-31T13:28Z,Just English.
,clvrc,2008-09-04T20:21Z,"Thnks. I'll seed as long as possible.

Do any one have ""How Art Made The World"" series?"
,alexsyan,2008-12-10T13:46Z,Seeeed pleeeeease!!!!!!!!!!
,alan1s,2009-03-23T01:18Z,"I saw this series in PBS and its excelent I really would love to have it, please somebody seed so I can have it, please please please please... thank you seej"
