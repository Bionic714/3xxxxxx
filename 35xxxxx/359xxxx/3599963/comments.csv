you must of really hated the reply i wrote on your torrent beause you reseeded it and added more to the comments.

to reiterate

the UK anti terrorism police analysed the video for evidence to prosecute the mosques raid them and imprison the preachers.  

what the police found lots of edited material , defamatory sentences in the documentary were actuallt cut and pasted together.

the UK Police then wanted to procescute the makers of the video."

in islam marrying prepubesant girls is forbidden

i have seen on trisha (the uk version of Oprah) mothers saying there daughters are out of control because they are bringing home boys at the age of 9.  the girl in question had pubic hair when she was 4 years old.  in islam even this girl would not be able to marry and Allah knows best.

Aisha the wife of the prophet on the otherhand was an extremely rare case because she matured physically and mentally.  Her knowledge and understanding of Islam far surpasses all but a few men."

i wanna see this!"

,rockstar11998,2008-05-09T17:41Z,This is a great video exposing the Saudi connection of Extremist Islam around the world.  They are financing the Jihad and brainwashing efforts around the world.  The United States and others need to stop buying their oil so that we can put a damper on this situation.  We need to seek out alternative fuel sources and make them work.  Yes this means restructuring our economy and such but it will be be restructured for us soon if we don't stand up to these Muslims.
