,Bartolllo,2008-05-31T22:48Z,"Thank-you so much for this torrent. I was a roadie for a night, lugging all the bands equipment up the 70 degree angle back stairs of the El Mocambo in Toronto back in the early 80's.
I got stoned and drunk with the roadies and watched the show sqeezed in with the rest of the sardines. It was one of the best musical times of my life. God rest Doug's soul. He was a great guy and it was an honour to watch him and the band perform. Thanks again.
Teary eyed Bart."
