,F1sav,2007-01-15T13:18Z,Sounds like this the DVDSCR
,madjock56R,2007-01-15T13:22Z,It will be a DVD Screener. He just gets a buzz making out its something else.
,campos13,2007-01-15T14:12Z,the picture and sound is perfect the only thing is the award consideration that comes across the bottom.. I've never heard so many ppl bitch and complain about getting things for free.. 
,madjock56R,2007-01-15T14:18Z,Thats cos its a screener you dick. If you gave it its right title instead of misleading people with your crap.
,campos13,2007-01-15T14:39Z,the quality is the same as a dvdrip
,madjock56R,2007-01-15T14:49Z,"I think Im hitting a brick wall here.

Yes the quality will be the same-ish,unless its been made from the Xvid, but you wouldnt know that cos you bought it....

A menu/chapters/subs and no ticker tapes is a Retail DVD.

Therefore put DVD Screener in the title and thats that, thats what its sourced from, and thats the way things work, unless you are stupid of course."
,campos13,2007-01-15T14:54Z,yes sir!
,madjock56R,2007-01-15T14:57Z,Good man 8p
