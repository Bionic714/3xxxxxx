,kai_99,2007-01-20T07:35Z,Do you like this movie?
,DeltaPan,2007-01-21T04:56Z,"Yes, indeed i do matey!

I had the video back in the eighties, nearly wore the damn thing out.
Haven't seen it for years so it'll be a nice treat.

Excellent hippie film, great music!

Especialy Age of Aquarius.

Thanks a million! : )"
,DeltaPan,2007-01-22T10:15Z,"I don't know why this has still got a seed showing because the peers on this are all stuck on 4.7%

Looks like the person uploading this has just pissed off and left it.

It should read, zero seeds and 12 pissed of downloaders at this moment in time.

Nice one Kai99."
,DeltaPan,2007-01-22T10:16Z,Sorry make that 17 pissed off downloaders!
