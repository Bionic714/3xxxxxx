IS THIS AVAILABLE IN ENGOUSH? PLZ ANSWER

--------------

No.  It is not available in ENGOUSH, nor is it available with all capital letters.

Please, for the love of God and Country, learn to speak English, and how to type.

I will never speak ENGOUSH, no matter how many times you request or demand it.
