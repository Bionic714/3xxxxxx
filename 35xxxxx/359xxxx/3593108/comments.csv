,moracca,2007-01-10T04:24Z,I see the subs folder in there...  this does have the english subs hardcoded into it correct?
,moracca,2007-01-10T04:40Z,"is this really the same source as the nuked release?  if so, I had the syncfix working and I don't really need to download another version if it still has that video glitch in the second cd"
,j.t.,2007-01-10T17:11Z,"so has it ""that video glitch in the second cd"" or not? anyone? its very annoying, that glitch...:("
[T],trackers,2007-01-10T21:33Z,"Yes: this does have the english subs hardcoded into it,
     the file in Sub.rar =  Rumanian (Romania) subs.

Yes: it still has that video glitch in the second cd.

No.: sound out of sync on cd2"
,rowborough,2007-01-10T22:58Z,"How can a 2 second pixalation be a major issue, this is great quality , if you want perfection get your hand in your pocket and go to the flicks.

Jesus what do you arsholes want, blood !!

Nice download, if these idiots met us face to face im sure they wouldnt be so vocal !!!!"
,blixten20,2007-01-11T00:54Z,english boys....häftigt prata på...
,moracca,2007-01-11T03:47Z,"first of all, rowborough, I already did put my hand in my pocket and pay to see the movie.  I liked it, so I wanted to download it.  I already HAVE a working version, but I was looking to download a version without the glitch.  I'm not complaining, just asking, so chill the hell out.  Second of all, I guarantee you aren't as tough as you think you are.

Third of all, the syncfix worked fine, why release a whole other torrent of the same source?  And isn't it against scene rules to steal sources?  I find it hard to believe that this is a proper release."
,moracca,2007-01-11T03:50Z,"that last post didn't make much sense...  I guess what I was trying to say was its not really ""proper"" if it still has the problem of the first release.  Why not just wait till another source is available before building a new torrent?"
,rainynight,2007-01-11T19:22Z,"Could someone please explain the sync fix in a bit more detail? I have a mac and use VLC and the ""control K"" method doesn't seem to work nor does the syncfix file I downloaded. What am I doing wrong? "
,jrocker125,2007-01-11T20:51Z,"hey i'm a mega noob when it comes to this stuff, can anybody tell me how to run this and what to DL, would be greatly appreciated, and thanks."
,kristofer84,2007-01-13T15:29Z,"why can´t I unpack cd1? It says that ""rssm-apocalypto1.r41.bc!"" i corrupt :S "
,KingeleN,2007-01-13T20:20Z,"I can't watch this, I get black screen and the video is pretty laggy. VLC laggs during this. Anyone else with the same problem? :/"
,maxkill,2007-01-14T01:26Z,its a damn damn good movie though!
,pmattiasp,2007-01-14T06:05Z,"finns ett svenskt cover här:

,Mackanen,2007-01-14T14:31Z,Whats wrong with piratebay these days??? So many seeders but sooooooooo slow!!! Its not like it used to be...
,Ezerbeth,2007-01-18T09:26Z,"Ok first off, there was a syncfix released for the iMBT release, for those of you out there who still dont know how to resync your movie using VLC.

As for moracca's question.. yes it is. But I think it's safe to assume since groups like RSSM, and NOBlE (who did another nuked PROPER from a stolen source) arent recognised as scene groups, they dont have to follow the rules, hence you get these crap releases. I mean... RSSM arent even listen on any of the major NFO sites... even less in PREbots or topsites.

Groups like that go for quantity rather than quality (obviously, just looking as this so-called PROPER). Dont believe me? Get yourself access to some nice PREbot and just compare the official scene release times with those stolen source groups' and judge for yourself. Same source, 3 days later than officially PRE'd... need I say more?"
,arkantigers,2007-01-18T14:19Z,"i read some of the comments regarding audio out of sinc although when i play with VLC player it is perfect.  Top quality visual as well, you wont find better.  thanks to original uploader!"
,katziewolf41,2007-01-19T18:35Z,"UGH hate it when they're split, why not all in one piece?

Great upload though THANKS!!!"
,all4nswe,2007-01-20T17:23Z,"LOL, all these seeders/peers and my download speed is @ 0kb/s. Fuck piratebay. The time for new and good torrent sites is here. We want quality, speed and rules. There is noone of the above on piratebay."
,bubach,2007-01-21T20:30Z,"No problem with the speed, I'm downloading in 600kb/s...
You have to actually seed yourself to get any dl speed! :P"
,peahgam,2007-01-23T05:46Z,"everything is perfect ... but i have a problem in sound , how do i listen to them..... "
,Daddddy,2007-01-24T22:07Z,This movie really sucks don't download it

,eylenno,2007-02-01T11:25Z,dont go to divxtitles unless you want subtitles in romanian or some other east european language! metasubs (.com) has no ads what so ever...
,EmesiS,2007-02-02T03:53Z,Well let's thank the MPAA for the upload. I guess they fixed the sync problem on cd 2 also. Those guys are pretty cool :)
,Malvoo,2007-02-02T21:43Z,What a gay movie...Mel Gibson doesnt know shit about directing.. ffs.. not recomended.

,octo1,2007-02-26T01:48Z,Are there English subtitles..?
,vladimir-dk,2007-03-11T15:43Z,"Yes ! there are english subtitles, and great quality btw. 

did anyone but me notice the subliminal dude in a redstriped shirt ? haha, made me laugh my ass off. In the scene where jaguar falls into the mass grave after running through the corn, a single frame consists of a man with an umbrella, red har, red striped shirt and jeans... sitting amongst the corpses.... 

i watched it over and over again to pause at the right moment :P and got it ! it's at -46:49 in the last half of the movie. seriously, try and find him !! "
