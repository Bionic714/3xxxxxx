It either freezes while it says ""Loading..."" or it says it can;t load. I noticed this is another type of file then the others(ones a ISO/.img and the others a .bin) is there anyway to convert this to one of those types? i tried ISOCraxtion but i cant get it to work"
,JesusEatsBabies,2007-01-27T05:47Z,and the trial version of MagicISO wont let you burn anything over 300MB and I'm not paying for the complete program just to burn this game

,JaalOnThePuch,2008-04-01T16:33Z,Will this work on a PS one ?? 
,PawnSacrifice,2008-04-06T12:05Z,"This works on a PSX emulator on your PC. I'm not sure but I think you could also burn it to CD and use it in your PS1/2/3. 

Simply load the image on your PSX emulator. 

I am getting freezing after about 5-10 minutes of play but I think this might be due to the emulator and not the game.

Thanks for the upload!

Anyone know where you can download the first one for the PC???"
