,Ykalon,2007-07-29T23:08Z,"Eminem, it had a point in the 90's, early 2000's but not now. I think there are more advantages to NOT use RAR than to use it now. bittorrent comes with built in hash check making sfv irrelevant. And I don't want samples. If you skip packing the files I can choose to not download the sample. Besides todays, games, movies, applications and music etc already use heavy compression so packing seldom makes the files smaller."
