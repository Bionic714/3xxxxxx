,Georghi75,2007-01-17T11:48Z,One of the best documentaries ever made!
,todu,2007-03-17T21:54Z,"This ""documentary"" is not science. It is new age religious bullshit. Read this review before wasting your bandwidth:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_the_bleep"
,Good ol Whatshisface,2007-04-24T13:03Z,"todu,science is not real.It is a study of how we understand the world around us.Even how some people will condemn what they dont understand and act like they're helping."
,HueMann,2007-07-28T16:49Z,"Wow! After reading the wiki I couldn't dare to think of downloading this film and coming to my own conclusions! You are right Todu! Read the Wiki and trust what it says and while you're at it TRUST ALL the mainstream media outlets like FOX for all we need to know about the world, politics and the universe.

DO NOT THINK FOR YOURSELF!!!
You may awaken in a world that you do not understand."
,forumsfeedback,2007-10-14T17:34Z,"Convincing, if confusing about direction, for the first half an hour and then the bullshit starts to subtly permeate. Craftily mixing science with fantasy to try and achieve some lower purpose. Pilger, Chomsky, Who Killed the Electric Car, Loose Change are much better options."
,captrob,2008-03-06T23:10Z,"I'm experimenting with tis for many years now, and IT WORKS!! Just try before you state your opinions. I don't work or have a bankaccount, have everyting i want or need, and no, i don't live in a hole in the ground! Truely sad now all this info is available, people see it as bull shit.
Even more sad, wiki seems to be the universal truth for most assholes, careful, it's only the truth for the West. THINK!!"
,captrob,2008-03-06T23:12Z,"There is a part two as well, i'll try to find and upload it."
,Tripin_toucan,2008-03-19T04:56Z,Dude this is just a point of view not a religious cult. Chill out and go back to your one way christian bullshit
,JayArsey,2008-03-26T10:34Z,Not science absolute rubbish but thanks for the up.
,AnTi-HeR0,2008-03-31T05:34Z,Dare to believe in something- certainly doesn't cost you anything to try..
,eldiab21,2008-04-07T21:22Z,Why not just watch something and get some new ideas ? 
,joey_clamz,2008-04-27T09:33Z,"Anyone who says this is 'religious pseudoscience'
obviously knows jack shit about quantum physics. You should be careful when you open your mouth that you do not display your ignorance so readily, children."
,joey_clamz,2008-04-27T09:41Z,"I just read the WIKI article on this and it is the worst case of slanted and illogical huxterism that I have ever witnessed. Whoever wrote that article should be ashamed of themselves on an academic level. If you can't leave your emotions and ignorance at the door, then please keep your fundamentalist ignorance to yourself."
,XxDeucexX,2008-05-16T01:13Z,"joey_clamz is right.  I just learnd about quantum entanglement today and seen a short clip from this movie, so now i want to see the whole thing.  This shit has blown my fucking mind!  the fact that they have split a particle, seperated it by 11 kilometers, and observed that what you do to one, instantly happens to the second one proves quantum entanglement..  holy shit my head is going to explode. i will be trying to process this for the rest of my life. :)"
,iamgeek,2008-07-12T17:54Z,"To all those who think this is Bull Sh1t....
We hav a word for you.... 

GO F#CK URSELF...
IF U DONT WANNA DOWNLOAD IT....  Stay the Fuck Out of here... why do u write bull sh!t comments, which misleads others..

Great UPLOAD DUDE..."
[T],komie,2008-08-23T20:21Z,"on reading the wiki article it sounds like scientists are scared that consciousness is what runs everything and that their feild of science they have chosen in life is just a very small part of the quantum sciences and is probably wrong 19th century thinking. i guess saying that the film does reflect whats really going on isnt profitable for the scientists that commented in the wiki article looking for funding from the hands that feed them, the ones that want us asleep thru to 2012."
[T],komie,2008-08-23T20:23Z,this is all about changing ur consciousness to new ways of thinking. instead of unconscious co-creation  to realising that our thoughts create the reality we live in. time to think nice thoughts all u stress heads!
,D1sturbance,2008-08-26T13:23Z,"Thank you for the upload.

And watch out for all that ""pseudoskepticism"" out there people."
,Blacklordheaven,2008-09-09T21:31Z,"Awesome torrent, loads of seeds ;)
Thanks you admiral."
,gosISdead,2008-09-22T11:17Z,"We once thought that the earth what flat and that is was the centre of the universe. He was condemed by the catholic church for practising pseudo science when he published his heliocentrism theory. Einsteins theory of general relativity and black holes were once pseudo-science, and now are governing laws of the very large in space and time.

Quantum physics is perhaps the true final frontier. Why do you think some people can look up something on wiki and assume it to be true. You have created you own little universe and reality travelling around you at all times.

To those people having trouble breaking down their pre conditioning may i suggest LSD or mushrooms. Smoking a joint can help also..."
,gosISdead,2008-09-22T11:18Z,"That was Galileo by the way, sorry for the typo"
,halfzipp,2008-12-10T08:07Z,"For those of you who are saying this isnt science, you need to watch this short film -> Quantum Physics meets Kabbalah -> http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4566648"
,dogme84,2009-02-14T20:16Z,"i say , whoever wants to believe this hugelly inacurate and full of bullshit movie is welcom , thats what the movie is about isnt it?
what i dont understand is how those who do like the movie can like such a poor and badly performed work of cinema ?!?!
it doesnt stand to any standard of m aking a movie , it takes no responsibility at all for anything !!!  noit thew way a movie is made nor what the movie contains!!! damn this movie is probably the worst hour and a half spent in my life .
im actually going to show this movie to my fellow art students on a course of things we disslike!

shame on those who are responsible for this embarasing piece of crap .

i feel that my inteligence has been violated...
kind of like rape or something ...
im gonna go puke now ..."
,bdehlin,2009-03-18T08:07Z,"Movies like this move us back in time... to the dark ages.  An attempt to rectify the incongruities between science and religion - ""god created science!"".  If you believe this garbage, you are a religious nut."
,imunionjack,2009-03-24T20:07Z,"The one thing that ruins this is the female chaneller.Im a firm believer in the practices but she doesnt help the films cause. If they had left it to the science and theories instead of that nutter MAYBE peeps would have accepted it more.And Zicoda my friend, you really should practice what the films trying to say instead of going mad at people sort yourself out first."
,caper454,2009-04-11T03:28Z,This is quite possibly the best film I've ever seen. It changed the way I see the world.
,Madfuel,2009-04-11T17:10Z,dogme..you have no inteLLigence
,synukrut,2009-04-17T04:24Z,"What utter crap. This is worse than Zeitgeist.

Is this like some new trend or something? Trying to have your insipid beliefs have some affiliation with Science? If this movie was made 50 years back, all we would've had was ""we don't know about this, among billions of other things, so God exists.""

Waste of time."
,TENeed,2009-04-21T04:59Z,"I don't think this has anything to do with religion. It's not trying to make you think any certain way, it's explaining science and theories that science is trying to prove. All this does is offer a different viewpoint... take it or leave it. There isn't a god to worship.. infact this movie even laughs at man's attempt to even try to contemplate what god is. I think it's a interesting way to look at things, and all of you haters talking shit about it... what's to talk shit about? Even if you don't believe it, you don't have to hold it against them.. these people are just trying to make you see things in a way they believe can make you HAPPIER! Why talk shit about that? Why talk shit about someone trying to make you feel important, unique, connected and joyful? You people make me sick."
,Jeebopz,2009-04-25T13:03Z,yea that sounds lame actually thx zicoda
,metrOjedi,2009-05-30T20:45Z,"dogme84 by your poor use of Language, I don't believe you have much intelligence to violate."
,luxor88,2009-06-07T20:21Z,"well, i am about to dl this movie, and before dl i read some comments. i do not believe that there are so many STUPID people alive, and how/WHY they do not die or do suicide? lol HueMann wrote: ""DO NOT THINK FOR YOURSELF!!!"". that made me laughing 'till i fell off the chair! :D well, who will think instead of you my friend? do you need to hire some1? haha :D

@torrent
i have read on my language that in this movie is explained that in matter of sex, we are all the same. i have few stupid friends, and wanna show them this movie, if it's really worth watching...

sry for long comment :)

cheers!"
,icerom,2009-06-16T06:01Z,"Amazing at the extreme reactions this film has elicited. And it isn't even that radical, IMO. Still, interesting.

Thx uploader!"
,Cheshiregizmo,2009-10-27T18:06Z,"haha, wow you can really tell who the close minded people are here.  Their attitudes say everything. They've got the skeptical aspect down, now they just gotta work on the open-minded part.  Don't BELIEVE anything...search for the truth, we are all scientists. 

PEACE."
,iTudy,2009-12-24T23:24Z,"Can't believe i had to log in so I can post how much of a back-ass-wards-as-[censored] you guys are. This movie doesn't send anyone back to the dark ages. It has worked for me since I saw it the first time ,never has it failed, not once. You guys are a bunch of ignorant fools. 'nuff said."
,daleel,2010-05-31T10:41Z,thanks for sharing!
,dubblue,2010-07-14T20:13Z,excellent.
,ambrosiaz,2011-09-02T09:19Z,DEFINITELY worth watching. Show it to your friends then talk about it 
,tsar3,2011-10-20T19:16Z,"Its been a while since I saw this film, in which time I got a degree in physics.  Reading the comments I think alot of people have missunderstood what this is about.  First its NOT a movie!?! Its a science documetary about what the mathmatics of quantum mechanics means for us in the real world as observers.  However alot of it is philosphical i.e cant be proven either way.  So its theory not necessaraly fact.

Watch this! Its good! Just dont take it all too seriously and understand that this is just a collection of a bunch of peoples ideas about the nature of reality.  Make up your own minds about reallity!!

I liked it; made me feel that being in control of my own destiny was achiveable; like I was in charge, and had the power to change anything through pure human will: Which I think is true."
