,red_vespa,2007-07-31T15:35Z,"Is there somebody who could please SEED a little more?
Ă&#x201E;r det nĂĽgon som kan seeda lite mer?"
,Fast1one,2007-11-14T20:36Z,"I've been looking for this for a while, can someone seed?"
,favn2,2008-07-06T19:19Z,"every album has each song 3 times, two of them have equal bitrate. So 1-st album has 69 songs instead of 23"
[T],guud23,2009-03-29T23:32Z,why are there three copies of each song!?
,7b,2009-10-10T01:26Z,"WTF is up with this torrent? 3 copies of each song, in .wma and .m4a - not even .mp3  ... I'll keep looking for a GOOD torrent, sorry."
,65788,2011-05-14T16:04Z,"Why is it that ""69 Love Songs"" seems impossible to find in .mp3? It kind of sucks that all the torrents provide it in .wma or .m4a.

If anyone finds it in .mp3, please tell me, yeah?"
