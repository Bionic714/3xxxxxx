MediaSentry is a company that provides services to the music recording, motion 

picture, television, and software industries for locating and identifying IP 

addresses that are engaged in the use of online networks to share material in 

violation of copyright. The company provides several services for this 

purpose, such as monitoring popular forums for copyright infringement, aid in 

litigation, early leak detection, and the distribution of decoy files.[1] In 

Foundation v. UPC Nederland, MediaSentry's investigative methods were held by 

an appeals court in the Netherlands to be unreliable. MediaSentry is used by 

several trade associations including the RIAA, MPAA, IFPI RIAA, movie studios, 

software companies, and record labels.

MediaSentry monitors auction sites such as eBay for distribution of pirated 

software and other property.

On June 13, 2005, Mediasentry was acquired by SafeNet.[2]

Although the RIAA states that it entered into the agreements with MediaSentry 

""on behalf of"" its members,[3] it appears that only the 'big four' record 

companies take advantage of MediaSentry services, as all of the known lawsuits 

have been brought only by those four companies and their affiliates. The RIAA 

seeks to keep its agreements with MediaSentry private.[4] Its arguments have 

been challenged by defendant Marie Lindor.[5] The motion was fully briefed and 

argued on November 30, 2006, and as of this writing the parties are awaiting 

the Court's decision.
