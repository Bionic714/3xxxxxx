[T],muzik62,2009-09-21T01:25Z,Thank You very much. I've been searching for John Adams for long. Once again: Thank You very much
,RexRexroth,2012-04-07T22:45Z,"I fell in love with Adams' music when I attended the world premiere of ""Grand Pianola Music"" in San Francisco 30 years ago, and am somewhat of a fanatic (I have seen ""Nixon in China"" in Houston (world premiere), NYC (three times), Washington, Los Angeles, and Freiburg, Germany, and already have all the recordings included in this torrent).  While I really love all of his music, especially the underrated ""El Dorado,"" I would have to call ""Naive and Sentimental Music"" his greatest orchestral effort to date.  And please give ""Klinghoffer"" a chance, no matter what your political alliances: it is a true masterwork.

GET THIS TORRENT!"
