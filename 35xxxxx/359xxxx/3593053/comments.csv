,jerry_01,2007-02-23T19:36Z,"Thanks uploader,when it says texted languages does that mean there are words popping up in a different language??.I guess what i mean is it's english spoken then words in another language popping up.Can you shut that off would kinda detract from the experience that i remember all english.Somebody have this PLZ advise as is a huge download and would like all seasons.But do not want them thingy's popping up in say Norwegian.Can't waste the bandwidth for that.Thanks ANYBODY "
