And the concept of a ""lolita"" being 18 years (and +!) strikes me as a fascinating little contradiction, since the term Lolita refers to a young girl seducing adult men, not an adult woman seducing other slightly older than herself adults. But perhaps the russial definition is a little different. 

The file being a .tar.gz is kind of funny too. I really don't see the point in uploading files that way. Why can't everyone just settle with WinRAR? Sure, it opens in WinRAR he says, but why the .tar.gz extension? Why isnt it called .RAR? These things usually mean someone wants to get payed before you can open his homemade format. What is the point of even compressing a video file? Unless... of course... you want to password protect it. Which I'm guessing is the case here. Am I right, DeadManUNI? "

,illum3,2007-01-19T03:30Z,".tar.gz is...what's used on *nix systems (MacOS X is heavily based off of Unix). It was around before .rar and .zip :P maybe he's a Linux user?
WinRAR you need to pay to use, Tarball and Gzip is opensource, you can get it for free. Tarball and Gzip is also a form of compression.

Eesh, people on the internet today lording about like they know all the tricks of the trade but are quite clueless :/

I don't see the contention over the file type. Of course, over the contents of the file, I can see why you'd be edgey about it."
,UltraBrazil,2007-01-19T08:23Z,"""and u zip or rar a moovie to make it smaller, not just to password it""

And how much smaller does that make it? 
At most, I'd say this file was 175 mb before compression. So what's the point? Compression also prevents one from viewing an incomplete file to see what it really is. For all we know, this could be any random 30 year old german hag with pony tails.

Take my word as a jaded porn consumer for it: When porn is compressed, it is usually because the uploader wants to hide the fact that there is a .txt file named ""Get password here"" included. Perhaps he is a mac user. Perhaps I'm being to quick to judge the uploader and the file. There's always that slim chance that someone actually is innocent. But until I get the file, still some 98% to go, I go in expecting this to be the same scam that the majority of compressed porn I've come across since the birth of the Internet and WinZIP has turned out to be.

And no, you don't need to pay to use WinRAR."

Thank you, best wishes!"
,gregersamsa,2007-01-19T12:26Z,"To add to the repertoar of ignorance, tar.gz whatever, is not a Macintosh format at all. Search the net, find out for yourself. 

However, it is a mystery to me why anyone would attempt to compress an divx-file, as UB already pointed out - there is little point of compression. I and all Mac-users with me, have a hard time understanding why rar is STILL such a popular format for most PC-users. Why compress when there's nothing to gain? All these questions.

Maybe the answers are to be found in good old Russial..."

,Hatx0r,2007-01-19T13:08Z,"Bloody idiots.
RAR will do nothing to movies or pics in terms of size. They're already compressed, you can't compress them more. All RAR does is prevent you from previewing the in-download torrent.

As for .tar.gz, it's a very common Unix/Linux/BSD system. WinZip, WinRAR, etc, etc, will open it without problem."
