,anonnymous,2007-01-07T21:32Z,"Hey ""millennium5"",
People like you make me really SICK! He just said the audio is out of sync to let other people know what is wrong with this release. You and many others like you complain as soon as somebody reports a bug about a release and want to shut him off. Why?
Of course the release is free. Yes, lot of things are free. But why we shouldn't know what is wrong with the free thing? lot of Penises are also free, but hey, they are bad and dangerous! I guess you like them just because they are free, ey? I am thankful of the guy who uploaded this release and I know that he is not guilty of ""out of sync"" problem. But I like to know if there is something wrong with this one, I go and download another release instead.
I hope you don't get mad, instead learn to be quite and don't show yourself as a toady."

,luckylopez,2007-01-10T20:56Z,"Great movie, although there's so much violence and suffering it sometimes makes you laugh.
Quality is good. Small audiosync problem is easily solved by manually syncing it in Mediaplayer Classic or VLC."
