Id=21220&rhtml=trueand 

download the full patch (1.21b), run it, and then try playing TFT.. it should work. It won't make the internet work but single player is all I really care about. GL HF!"

,madfto95,2012-04-02T06:18Z,I installed it succesfully but it doesn't allow me to play battle net or any other multiplayer function. Probably because it isn't a copy of the original. Something must've been done to it to fuck it up.
