These are all sites that can answer all those false claims and lies and any question you may have about anything.

Some of the best scholarship in the world presented on these sites.

,daddychainmail,2011-09-10T09:22Z,"My absolute favorite thing Mormons are called is ""cult."" Man does that one make me laugh! I'm an English study with a word morpholoy focus and I've gotta tell ya: Cult, noun. From the derivative ""To cull"" or ""bring together."" It doesn't mean crazy vodoo or mumbo-jumbo. It means today's equivalent of hanging out. You CULTivate things you cherish. A herd of sheep, a group of people discussing poetry, two people angrily having religous debate. They are all cults. 

All. of. them. 

Always cracks me up."
