Female Trouble marks the last time the Waters\' Dreamland crew works together. Divine plays two characters Dawn Davenport and Earl. This has to be Divine\'s finest hour in acting. Waters\' subject matter and themes presented in this film still hold true to this day. This is my favorite John Waters film. He balances the humor and gross out set pieces perfectly. They compliment each other instead of overpowering one another. John Waters obsession with serial killers and their ilk is strongly represented here.

Female Trouble was shot on 16mm , in color and has been shown in several different running times.

Highly recommended. A+

Enjoy!
