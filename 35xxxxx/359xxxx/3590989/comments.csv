Is it an idea to superseed it though, maybe it will be faster?"
,Straticus,2007-01-10T02:43Z,"as far as I know, Azureus's Superseed mode kicks in automatically as necessary...I'm getting great upload speeds on all my torrents at the moment, all going between 50kb/s and 75kb/s

,Straticus,2007-01-13T11:58Z,"Hum, according to my console, I AM still seeding this file....if nobody is getting it, something's wrong, and I'd be very glad to hear suggestions about what I need to do to make sure everyone gets this...

,hypermax,2007-01-14T17:12Z,"This one has been stuck at 32.6% for days and days, no way you are seeding properly. There is about 20 people waiting.."
,Straticus,2007-01-16T16:19Z,"Hypermax, as soon as Polyester is being seeded by someone else, I'll get on this one again and make sure everyone gets it...not sure what's wrong, but I'll figure it out"
,hypermax,2007-01-16T23:04Z,"Good of you too take care of your torrents :-)
I`m on Polyester as well so I will make sure to keep seeding it a while!"
,UNIXgod,2007-02-02T19:48Z,SEED PLEEZE!!!!
