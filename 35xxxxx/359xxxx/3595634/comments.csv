,theredpirate,2007-12-05T03:46Z,"forest hunter, a ""no cd crack"" is a crack that allows you to play the game without having a CD in the drive. Without this, the game will not work unless you have a CD in the drive, even if you have the game installed on your hard drive making a CD unneccesary.

Someone please make this for leopard!!!!

AoE III 1.03 No CD Crack

I've been playing AoE III for a while now, but the No CD crack by The Blade Corp broke under OS X Leopard. A few weeks after the release of Leopard, The Blade Corp released a new crack.

But Leopard introduced a new bug to AoE 3. When playing the multiplayer part of the game, an error would come up saying: Out of Sync. So everyone was unable to play in multiplayer mode over LAN or GameRanger. After waiting a few days and dying to play a multigame I started looking at what the crack by Nozio actually did. It modified the Info.plist and MacOS/Age of Empires III files. Anyways here is how I did it:

Install Age of Empires III

Download the No CD crack, launch the app and follow the instructions

AoE should work fine now, except for the multiplayer part

Open up the Finder and go to your Applications directory. Right click on the Age of Empires III icon and click Show Packet Contents. Go to Contents -> MacOS and copy the Age of Empires III file to you desktop.

Download the 1.03 update from MacSoft

Apply the update

Once the update is complete, put the file copied in step 4. back to it's original position.

Run AoE III and enjoy the working multiplayer part!


I have no idea if all fixes which are made in the 1.03 are applied, what I do know is that this method works for me and I'm able to play multiplayer under Leopard. 

Warning: if you wanna backup all your game progress before reinstalling or updating, copy Age of Empires III folder from your Documents folder and copy it back after the process. I'm not responsible for any damage to you Mac.

If this method works for you, please let me know through the comments system below .

Is there a way to play with gameranger with 1.0.3?"
,fweym,2008-03-30T21:13Z,"Hi i downloaded this crack, tried to launch the app but it just says ""the application quit unexpectedly""... is it because I have Leopard? can someone help pls!?"

** ATTENTION ** ! ! !

NO MORE CRACK NEEDED !!!!

Step 1: Install AOE3 and/or Expansions

Step 2: Update AOE3 to the latest patch (1.05) and then update the expansions to the latest patch. heres a link to all the patches
http://destineergames.com/support/?page_id=88

Its that easy!

Now Age of Empire 3 should even work online, no crack needed because the latest updates remove the cd check, just download Gameranger create a free account and your good to go.

Hope this helps. If you still cant get Age of Empires III to work then its because you failed to follow my simple steps.

See you on the battlefield! xD"
