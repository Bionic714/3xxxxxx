,Ninnisen,2007-01-20T14:36Z,Saw filmclips on the homepage. This thing is scary. It's a f****in cult!
,Gomorra,2007-01-21T00:00Z,Jesus is Lord
,togo,2007-01-21T03:18Z,"I list my religion as Wicca. I have no problem with the Jesus, other than he takes all the darn press. All we got is Wicker Man, and our religion is more than burning the odd stranger in a giant Wicker Monster, in fact it doesn't even spell the same, and satanists also came much later. So like the Druids we are mostly watching the Jesus fad and we will be here for you once you all start worshipping the Earth and Trees and stuff, organic like. Sort of like vegetarians but we eat meat and the source is unseen, of life, but you can understand it. But it aint a dude that hovers over a lake, or dies becuase you were bad and everyone talks about it,  but the things you know, from before, origins, path of all life. "
,Ninnisen,2007-01-21T15:54Z,Blessed be Togo. :)
,Loompa,2007-01-22T17:35Z,I was waiting for this docu thanks a lot!!!
,nalu22,2007-01-22T19:53Z,"Sounds great to worship the Earth and all...how does Wicca(sp?) explain exactly how the Earth and life came to be?

Point that most do not know about the Bible...it is filled with prophecy that came true.  That is what proves that the Bible is the true Word of God.  Not some fables written by men as most think.  Jesus did live and was known to be ""special,"" the Romans as well as the Jews wrote about Jesus.  If you know you're history they both had every reason to not include Jesus in their history.  Including Him only helped Jesus' claim's to be the Son of Man.

A couple for you to research if you so desire to know the truth, as you know the truth shall set you free.  There were all written several hundred years >before< Jesus walked the Earth.

Born of a Virgin:

Isaiah 7:14, ""Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign: The virgin will be with child and will give birth to a son, and will call him Immanuel.""

Rejected by His own people:

Isaiah 53:3, ""He was despised and rejected by men, a man of sorrows, and familiar with suffering. Like one from whom men hide their faces he was despised, and we esteemed him not.""

His side pierced:

Zech. 12:10,  ""And I will pour out on the house of David and the inhabitants of Jerusalem a spirit of grace and supplication. They will look on me, the one they have pierced, and they will mourn for him as one mourns for an only child, and grieve bitterly for him as one mourns for an only son.""

P.S. 2,000 year's and counting for the new covenant, I think that qualifies as more than a ""fad.""

P.S.S.  I pray that the truth of our Lord Jesus Christ finds you before you perish."
,daveggg,2007-01-23T00:11Z,"This is not an effective way to make people sceptical about fundamentalists or christians. This movie is good PR for them and I support any christian taking a stand against the perverted anti-cultural society that grows everyday without people even questioning it anymore. They want to raise above what we have become: pathetic and empty consumers occupied with surface. I salute anyone refusing to become a slave under his lower instincts. May it be christians or whoever. Would you prefer your kids being deprived of the chance to find themselves because they are occupied with every nonsense crap that media and marketing wants you to really care about? This is a form of humanism, may it be a bit hysteric at times. The makers of this film wants to ride on a populist secular wave that is basically nihilistic. If the meaning of life is status, money and property, then there is no meaning. That is a modern way of thinking and a new low for humanity."
,FilboidStudge,2007-01-23T00:57Z,"So, nalu22, let's get this straight: this guy, who was a normal man (but was also God) was born after his mum, who'd never had sex, was impregnated by the Holy Spirit (who was also God too)... he then flirted with carpentry for a bit before suddenly, in his last 3 years on Earth, giving a lot of oblique speeches and then choosing to die but then becoming alive again, going to the top of a hill and floating into the clouds to be with his dad (who is also himself - oh, and God too).

Well, hosanna in the highest!!"
,nephilim70,2007-01-23T04:37Z,"I think FilboidStudge has it right from his perspective anyways(how did you get your head up there anyways)... 
He probably has a much better theory for how the earth/space/time thing was created... If you could enlighten us with your wisdom, that would be great. 
You should never attack a viewpoint without supplying your own reasons/theory. It makes you seem childish and ignorant. Remember just because you don't like it, doesn't mean it's not true... 
Good for you nalu"
,blayno,2007-01-23T05:30Z,"oh god.........
religious debate, how pointless (but fun!)
no religion can actually be true because of the fact that ALL religion is regional, christian in the west, muslim in the middle east, buddah etc etc. now it is one of gods commandments not to worship false idols, so every non-christian who is religios goes straight to hell right? even a child born in feudal japan, before any missionaries set foot in the country, is destined for eternal damnation just for worshiping the gods of their parents, no matter how good or pious they live their lives. a loving god wouldnt do this. come on christians, get off your high horses and just be good to other people, kind to animals, and make this world a better place, just incase youre wrong....."
,Bojtikken,2007-01-23T10:13Z,you guys are totally fucked. there is no god.
,daveggg,2007-01-23T15:09Z,"It is a BELIEF! The point is not that it has been real but that it is a kind of life philosophy. A wish to struggle and become something better. For cynical fools, commenting that ""there is no God"" and writing unbelievably childish comments like ""Filboidstudge"", anyone wanting to raise above the current shit-level of society can just PITY you and your sad nihilism that will surely make you face your own shallow soul one day when you least expect it. Then, few things will comfort you.."
,Bojtikken,2007-01-23T15:21Z,haha... get a life
,poachstevens,2007-01-24T22:50Z,and here everyone is discussing the gospel on a pirating network stealing somone elses hard work. lets get off our high hoses people cause i think there a commandment being trashed...
,DeathTree,2007-01-25T22:33Z,never before have i seen such evil...
,bigdrocks,2007-01-26T14:15Z,"Religion is for weak minds!  It's for those that can't face the world as it is, and need some higher power to believe in.

Unwilling to take responsibility for their own lives, these lemmings allow organized religion to tell them what is right and wrong, ethical and unethical.  It's sad, but like most things, it will pass.

I do believe that there was some guy called Jesus, lived 2000 years ago, was a little crazy, thought he was Gods son, got many people to believe him, was killed for his beliefs (and due to what he was doing to the general population....those in power don't like revolutionaries), became a martyr.....a religion is born. 

Nuff said."
,bigdrocks,2007-01-26T14:18Z,"Forgot to insult the bible......

......it's a book!  Nothing more.  Written by a bunch of men....by committee....many years ago....none of whom were present during the events depicted in the bible.

I prefer the gospel of ""The Shining,"" where ""all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy"".

:-)"
,Bojtikken,2007-01-30T09:44Z,"yea ... i agree bigdrocks.

could not have written it better!!!"
,falsethreats,2007-02-01T17:07Z,"In actuality, books of the bible were written in different times and not by a committee, however there have been problems with credibility.

This is not to say that the events in the bible MIGHT be true. Keep in mind that the books added in the bible were chosen out of a larger collection of books. The books that were not added would destroy the meaning of the bible, such as the Gnostic Gospels, that claim that Jesus was married to Mary Magdaline and had a child with her. Other books talk about Jesus murdering a man, Pontius Pilates' story after Jesus' execution, Enoch's journey into the afterlife with God (Enoch was one of the only men who entered heaven without the required blood of Jesus), etc. These books were declared as blasphemy, but their credibility is as good as many of the books added in the bible (specifically the Old Testament).

If you read Genesis 3:16a, it says ""To the woman he said, 'I will greatly increase your pains in childbearing; with pain you will give birth to children.'"" How terrible......if not for our technology, which has made it possible to provide pain relief with pain killers. Christians in the 1800's wanted women to deal with the pain instead of relieving it (because of Genesis 3:16a), but today, nobody cares. People today don't feel it is a sin to have an epidural birth EVEN THOUGH it is clearly written in the bible that the punishment of Eve (women in general) is having painful childbearing. To avoid punishment is unthinkable in Christianity, unless, of course, you have been saved by Jesus. Therefore, the invention of epidual birth should prove one or two of three things: (1) that God does not exist, (2) that the book of Genesis has lost credibility, or (3) that humans have outsmarted God."

,laurentron,2007-02-09T23:34Z,"i downloaded this to play on my intel macbook, and there is no audio. anyone else have this problem?"
,yang_damian,2007-02-12T11:27Z,"Religious debate is always so pointles. Thing is people will always believe what they want to believe, rather than what seems reasonable. And if they do so, fine! Let them be. Everybody has the right to pursue happines the way they seem fit. 
However in doing so, they should remember that for the same reason they have the right to believe that God is true and mighty, everyone else has the right to believe that Budha, Allah, or the hindu floating thingy is also true and mighty, or for that matter the atheist have the same right to believe in nothing.
Botomline is believe in all you want, just don't go bothering people with you're beliefs."
,madhouserevival,2007-02-19T07:53Z,"Uh, how about talking about the quality of the download and the video and sound instead of hurling insults at eachother?"
