,jomax,2007-01-09T20:38Z,Thank you but why does my dl speed jump from 40 Kb/sek to 350 kb/sek and back to 40 kb/sek and so on? I use bit torrent for the moment.
,Thorneater,2007-03-30T23:28Z,"anybody wants to release a 1.5gb version?
I'm from belgium and only got 30gb each month, so 22(11) gb for one movie is quite alot. putting a 213min film in +- 1.5gb will still give a great quality...

anybody wants to do this?pm me the link plz.
tnx"
