,sal,2007-01-07T11:45Z,"is this just the movie or does this have the original menu still intact please?

cos it seems a bit small if it has the menu then an answer would be nice.

,asinart,2007-01-07T12:49Z,"The file is not complete, it does not extract...

I get the following message from WinRAR when the extracting process is at 96%:

CRC failed in severance-severance2006.img. The file is corrupt"
,sal,2007-01-07T15:14Z,"asinart,make sure you let it hashcheck once it is downloaded.when it is fiished depoending on your client it will hashcheck and make sure you got 100% of the download,you can always download the torrent again and when you open it,choose what you downloaded already and it will hashcheck and if you didnt get all the download it will download what you need.

also try upgrading your winrar,thats what you should be using so i assume thats what you got,upgrade it to the latest versiuon of winrar and see whgat happens.

i had no probs whatsoever extracting the img,i am burning it now so i can find out if it has the original menu intact or if its a piece of shit custom job,it says custom in the title but,is that custom(as in menu)or is that custom as in swedish subs.

well i burn it and stick it in my 360 and see whats what.then i post again.cos if its custom menu,best was to grab an xvid dvdrip.and they are shitty just like custom menu,tacky as fuck.
;-)"
,sal,2007-01-07T15:23Z,"its a piece of shit custom menu.what is spiel filmen.fucking leave the menus intact and learn to put the sub packs in the films directory you fucking faggot.

,asinart,2007-01-07T16:25Z,"Thanks Sal, did as you desribed, downloaded the torrent again, started hash checking and then downloaded a small missing part, it's working fine now !!"
