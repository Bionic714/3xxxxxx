,miralalala,2007-07-26T07:47Z,"Thanks Devil! It works like a charm :)

Mr. Samsung I used Daemon tools!
For those still fuguring out what to do:
-Extract the three files with Daemon
-Run the first file (the .exe)
-After a while its asks for the second disk. Open the extracted second file (a .dat file)
-It takes a while fot it to finish but it does :)

Eh does anyone know what to do with the third file? I never used it or needed it....

Goodluck!"
,mr samsung,2007-07-26T12:51Z,"hmmmmm.  my deamon tools refused to open the 2. and 3. pak file also tried with magic iso. Same result.

,TheGoose31,2007-08-04T16:14Z,"To install it:

1) Mount CD 1 in Daemon Tools
2) Run the Installer
3) Once it says to put in CD 2, unmount CD 1 and mount CD 2
4) Continue with installation."

,adrian123760,2008-05-31T13:39Z,"Thanks.

I almost gave up and thought i would buy it till i found this torrent.
---------
SUPER EASY INSTALL METHOD:

1. open all 3 ISO's with win rar and extract(make sure all iso's were extracted to the same folder)
2. now got to the folder where you extracted them
3. run setup.exe
4. Wait this can take a long time
5 go to start menu-->maxis--> and enjoy
-----------------------
It worked for me and is simple to follow "

Thanks to everyone, now my brother is very happy (he loves the sims)"
,shadowxryu,2008-08-10T05:01Z,"Sims was working fine for me, install took a ages! I couldnt mount with daemon tools. Had to extract all files to the same folder then click setup. did not ask me for any cd's. The making magic intro takes ages to load. once loaded i was able to play for about 2 weeks then a problem occurred. I wanted to expand my house so i went onto the build tool. Clicked on the floor tiles and near thedifferent floor tiles there is a right arrow. Clickong on that right arrow to show the other tiles would make my sims game crash and close. It would also take off my Wallpaper. Anybody have any suggestions?"
,pooredward,2008-10-17T14:52Z,"Oh, come on you guys. This is a great torrent, just to download and install. We don't have to do a thing on our own. A five year old can do it and we get all of this for free. 8 sims games. So what if it takes half an hour to install?

By the way, if you can not save and/or if your family doesn't show up when you move in to a new house - do as FelpMan says; download the sims 1 (original version without any extras) and just mount it. Or if you allready own the first disk just run it
AND EVERYTHING WILL WORK JUST FINE.

Thanks a lot for this great torrent, will be seeding for a long time."

works perfect."
,AuRteam,2009-07-25T02:14Z,"I am downloading now...download speed isnt great at only 113/5KB/s but oh well, its going. The people that ask what the 3rd disk is, its Utilities meaning it would be no-cd cracks, keygens, the like. Disk 1 and Disk 2 are the Sims 8 In 1, disk 3 is just utilities."
,AuRteam,2009-07-25T14:27Z,"Scratch that, disk 3 is in fact a Sims installation disk, but there is a Utilities folder on the disk. I have never installed Sims before on my PC until using this torrent, and when playing I CAN save and families ARE appearing, meaning you guys that are having this problem are doing something wrong, so here is a step-by-step guide to install The Sims 8 in 1 using this torrent.

1. Download the torrent
2. SEED
3. Make sure Deamon tools is updated, if not, update it now. Next, set your number of devices to 3.
4. In the folder you have downloaded, there are 3 CD files. Emulate 1 CD on each Deamon virtual drive. Ex: Disk 1 on F, Disk 2 on G, Disk 3 on H.
4. The first CD should generate an auto-run, go through the setup and install. When setup asks you for disk 2.arc, point it to the virtual drive you are emulating disk 2 on. Double click on the drive, and inside should be the .arc file, click that and setup will continue. Do the same for disk 3. Oh, and for the people that say the setup never asked for disk 3, thats probably why youre experiencing errors. Always keep Deamon tools updated, I installed and didnt get any errors this way.

Oh, and when you load it up it says Makin Magic, but all expansions are installed, dont worry."
,ninaa25,2009-08-01T14:38Z,doesn't work!

,Nuboko,2010-08-10T00:30Z,Install takes forever so dont get pissed thinking it froze... your just installing 8 games... remember that
,crazybellanza,2010-10-01T09:44Z,"Installed fine and the game opens and initially runs fine, but (DUN DUN DUN) when I create a family and move it in, when the lot I moved the family into loads there's no Live mode- it's the same as when you go to edit an empty lot or a community lot. And when I exit to the neighbourhood, the family I created and moved in no longer exists. I haven't tested yet whether I can load pre-existing families or not yet.

If it helps, every time I try to move in a family those ""Vacation Island resorts are being set up, please wait"" or ""People are flocking to Downtown, please wait"", etc. screens that you get when you put new expansions on appear, despite the fact I've already seen those screens multiple times in the same install. Does that make sense? :) Thanks"
,crazybellanza,2010-10-09T18:14Z,Never mind- I just realized I've been having the exact same problem as everyone else. Woops :)

i downloaded the game and installed as instructed but i can't save at all there is a saving error i know some people said they have downloaded the regular version but pls let me know where u have found it i am dieing to play a proper sims after 6 years :(((("
,utdrule3,2011-07-21T17:31Z,"Thanks, works great!
If you have the problem with ""not saving/families not loading"", just right click the sims.exe icon and change compatibility mode to windows xp service pack 2 and run as administrator."
,MasterOfNotAlot,2012-08-09T21:08Z,"Torrent so far seems to be working as intended. No problems. Just mount the files in order: 1 > 2 > 3. It is a VERY long install, and at times will sit without moving. Just let it run it's course. Eventually it will ask for disc 2. 

For me, it didn't ask for Disc 2. Instead a window popped up asking me to open a .pak file(I believe it was disk2.pak but could be mistaken.) I just mounted the disk2.iso file in Deamon Tools, went back to the window asking me to open the file, then opened it by going to the mounted drive. It did the same for Disc 3.

You're not opening the .pak files. The installer just needs to read them to finish the install. All you need to do is direct the installer to where the .pak file is once it prompts you to. 

Also, while downloading and installing, I decided to do what has been suggested, and I downloaded a separate torrent of The Sims 1. DO NOT MOUNT until the 8 in 1 is finished installing. Once finished, and you mount The Sims 1, a window will pop up asking you if you wish to play.

I have had no problems thus far."
