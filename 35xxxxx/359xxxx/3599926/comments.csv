,Dackery,2007-01-21T01:29Z,"Neat, to the people that think that it's too small to be a real app, read a book. Idiots that think all programs should be 4Gb to be worth it *tsk*

Pity there aren't many australian channels :-("
,mcham,2007-01-22T04:45Z,"The program works and there is no virus.
The problem is that it only streams webcasts, not actual TV.  For example, if you go to the NBC channel, it will show you the webcasts of NBC.com, not the real time NBC TV program."
