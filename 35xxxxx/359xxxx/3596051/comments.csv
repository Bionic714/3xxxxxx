,ganjaguy,2008-10-07T00:54Z,"Sorry to double comment, but i have GOM player, and i was wondering how i play the whole thing if there are twenty-something files?"
,sunshinestate,2008-11-09T08:46Z,"FYI, this will not play on an xbox 360. its the only xvid file i've ever come across that won't work."
,Arsonx,2009-03-04T05:28Z,"Wonderful quality. To watch it, just highlight all the RAR's and right click and select extract here, and a video file should pop up."
,johnkramer1,2009-08-11T23:36Z,this video plays fine on my Xbox something must be wrong with yours sunshinestate
,rebenga,2010-01-14T21:31Z,"You are all so stupid. UNRAR THE SHIT, then play it. If you don't know what I'm talking about, then get the fuck off torrenting and go back to Nintendo."
,shelborg,2010-03-04T05:59Z,honestly not sure how it worked or why with the multiple .rar files but I was able to extract it all w/ 7zip (I hate it too... but seems like that is the new trend for torrent files)
,_Stranger,2010-06-13T08:05Z,"Alright guys, computer lesson time.

Any time you see a .rar file, it means it's a Winrar archive, and you need to have the free Winrar program to use them.  These files are opened with Winrar by simply right clicking the file then using ""Extract Here.""

However, there's another case that you might encounter on your adventures.  That's a series of files that end in something along the lines of "".part01.rar"", "".part02.rar"", etc.  (You also might just see "".part1"" if you have file extensions hidden)  These are also Winrar archives, however they've just been split into parts.  Do not be alarmed.  Proceed just like you normally would by right clicking the first in the series and using ""Extract Here"" just like you normally would.  You will get one normal, whole file when it's done doing it's thing.

You have made great strides today."
,comehonorface1,2011-04-03T07:47Z,who puts video files into rar anyway well besides that good torrent
,lestermackay,2011-05-21T22:55Z,"I don't know what anyone is complaining for, this is seriously the first video i've ever downloaded and i opened it no problem."
,OttifantSir2,2011-07-07T11:33Z,"Files that RAR'ed in parts are downloaded from Usenet, and the uploader hasn't bothered to extract the files themselves. Some because they are lazy, some because they have discovered the ugly truth about about VLC: It can play rar-files. That's right. Just add the first file (if there is ONE file with the extension .rar, it's the first, not .r01 or .part1 or whatever. If there's NO file with .rar, then you go back to .r01/.part1/whatever)

An SFV-file is a ""Sum File Verification""-file. This is sort of like an index in a book. You check the index and read the book. If something is mentioned in the index that you can't find, or in this case the download, the download isn't correctly done. I never bother with this thing unless I download the latest Ubuntu, and they use MD5, not SFV, so I don't know how you check SFV.

If you want to extract multiple-part-RARs like this, see if there's ONE file with .rar. If it is, open it in WinRAR, WinZip, PZip, 7zip, whatever, then extract it. You don't have to mark and open each and every file like some have suggested, because each little file has a pointer to the next file and any compression program worth using sees this and extracts all of them automatically."
,infernal_dante,2011-09-10T07:31Z,so fucking sick of ppl uselessly raring movie files. STOP IT!!!
,Sojin,2012-01-10T11:56Z,so fucking sick of ppl uselessly complaining about free movie files. STOP IT!!!
,j0nnyboy,2012-01-22T06:45Z,"why the hell would you do rar files? don't mean to whine, but come on..."
,panamalynn,2012-02-21T21:17Z,Thank you for the upload.  I am just so thankful to be able to get this.  I live in a tiny fishing village in Central America and we have no North American television or video store or movie theatre.  We are lucky to have internet albeit slow.
