

Things to look for:
1. Ya Tayr and Alamouni are both shot while Fairuz walks down the hills and valleys of the small towns exposing beautiful landscape which is nice to see and kind of authenticate the setting of the film.

Miscellaneous information:
1. Both Assy and Mansour play roles in this film. Assy has a more predominant character. He plays Abou Ahmed, the freedom fighter. Mansour role however is very small. I didn't even get his name in the movie.
