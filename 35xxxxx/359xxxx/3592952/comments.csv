,mr_dolis,2007-01-18T15:50Z,the serial doesnt work!!:S
,stukaville,2007-01-19T21:36Z,"sp4 is not included, you can download it off Microsoft, choose the network version to save it all to disk.  The serial number may have one digit wrong, i remember having probs myself as my writing is abit shit, i will re look and see if i can revise it"
,stukaville,2007-01-19T21:40Z,"try doing this, mp847-tmqq(c or 6)-b2(g or 6)t2-38t(6 or g)v-qqr28. sorry about the fuck about but i haven't got a system to try it on, it was a request for someone who had a keygen, if you cannot find a keygen i will download one and up the serials for you"

,Kagome41083,2007-02-08T23:48Z,"Hey there, I am currently downloading this, I have a question to ask, will this CD after I burn the Windows2000 onto the CD, will it ask for a bootable disk to insert on Drive A?  Because the other one I have does and I have no floppies, so before I burn it will it ask to insert a disk in Drive A?  Thanks. :)"
,Kagome41083,2007-02-08T23:57Z,"Let me rephase that alittle lol!  The last copy I burned of Windows2000 was from a different site, and when I insert the CD into the drive upon installation it said:  Please insert a Windows2000 Professional CD into Drive A and press ENTER to continue, so before I burn this one onto a CD will this installation do the same or no?  That's all I want to know because I have no floppy disks. Thanks. :)"
,stukaville,2007-02-11T11:49Z,"np kagome, this is an image off a bootable CD, it will not ask for a floppy disk.  Just boot your pc from cd and it will install"
,Kagome41083,2007-02-15T02:37Z,"Hey, I did what you said but it didn't boot from the CD at all, instead it went straight to XP and I want to take XP off since this computer cannot handle XP that well, XP keeps taking too much out of the video card so it needs something simple.  Anyway am I doing something wrong?  Because on the other CD it boots from CD and that's the one that asks for Floppy."
,Kagome41083,2007-02-15T19:09Z,"Hmm...I wonder after I had burned this to a CD was I supposed to make it so it's bootable?  Because the burning program that I have is Sonic, maybe that's why it didn't work because I didn't make it bootable or am I wrong?"
,Kagome41083,2007-02-20T04:08Z,"Hey, nevermind I got it, my friend told me what is it that I'm missing to burn the image onto the CD so now it works. :)  I have it on this computer now. :)"
