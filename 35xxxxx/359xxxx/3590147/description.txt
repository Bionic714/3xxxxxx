From title page:

"A copy of this textbook is issued to each appointed elder, and he may retain it sa long as he continues to serve as an elder in any congregation. At such time as he should cease to serve in that capacity, his copy of the book must be handed over t othe Congregation Service Committee, since this publication is congregation property. No copies are to be made of any part of this publication."
