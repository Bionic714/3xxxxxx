,L.Jamf,2007-01-05T14:15Z,"Assuming that human life is worth more than what you spend as a consumer (disregarding any difficulties entailed by such a calculation), what has that got to do with joining a religion?"
,zardoz7026,2007-01-05T17:34Z,"When a cult becomes mainstream, people start calling it a ""religion"". All ""religions"" are cults because they all expect you to throw reason and logic aside, and ""just have faith"".  Thanks for the torrent."

,BP OMowe,2007-01-06T17:50Z,"""what has that got to do with joining a religion?""

The only ones ""subhuman enough"" to find the faith are those who realise that a life is far more than just producing and spending.
Hence people with strictly materialistic and/or economic values will not belive in the spiritual forces surrounding all religions."
,L.Jamf,2007-01-06T21:30Z,"What about those ""who realise that a life is far more than just producing and spending"" AND spiritual forces, and who also realize that the dichotomy between bad materialism and good spiritualism (= if you haven't got religion you're an evil & simpleminded materialist who don't think, except about money) is a piece of religious propaganda?
And: if there are such things as spiritual forces, why would they limit themselves to surrounding religions? (Just a thought: if it really is so, could it be because the general lack of spirit in religion -- something like a spiritual vacuum -- is kept up by excluding all spirit, that is by keeping it outside, in its surroundings?)"
