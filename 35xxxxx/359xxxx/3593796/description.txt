After directing the critically acclaimed Re-Cycle with his brother earlier this year, Oxide Pang goes solo this time to present a tense psychological thriller that will leave you guessing to the very end. In Diary, Pang sets aside the supernatural to focus on the frightening delusions of the mind. Like all of the Pang Brothers' previous films, Diary is beautiful to look at, with the aesthetically aged set design, impressive CG work, and decaying earth tones contributing greatly to the film's creepy atmosphere. Pang makes the best of his young cast, and Charlene Choi carries the film with an effectively unsettling performance alongside Shawn Yue (Infernal Affairs II) and Isabella Leong (Isabella). Full of cerebral twists and turns, Diary pulls viewers into a young woman's world of lonely paranoia, where reality and illusion are disturbingly blurred and love can lead to ominous consequences.

The dour and volatile Winnie (Charlene Choi) likes to make wooden puppets and write in her diary. After her boyfriend Seth leaves her, Winnie becomes increasingly emotionally and psychologically unstable. At the urging of her friend (Isabella Leong), she starts a new relationship with Seth-lookalike Ray (Shawn Yue), but the relationship soon makes the same downward spiral as before. As the situation worsens, so too does her grasp of reality. Or perhaps none of this is real in the first place. The answers all lie in her diary...
