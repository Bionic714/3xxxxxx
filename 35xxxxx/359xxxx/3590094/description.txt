THIS IS NOT AN OFFICIAL DAILY SHOW RELEASE.

THIS IS PART 3 of 3 iPod version of the DVD release - Jul - Nov 2006.

This is the continuation of my Best of The Daily Show DVD series. Vol. 3 covers from Nov. 2005-Nov 2006 and ends with the election night coverage. Once again it was a long (yet enjoyable) effort to compile all of these clips and I had to leave out a great many things, of course. There are few a clips from correspondents, but it is mostly all Jon. This year I will not be creating a Correspondent Corner version, but I WILL put together a Best of The Colbert Report Year #1 in the coming months.

Thanks to all of you who have sent messages from around the globe after enjoying Vols. 1 & 2!!

Enjoy and PLEASE SEED!!
