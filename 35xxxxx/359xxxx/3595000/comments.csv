I waited a week before I finished the upload of the series so that some of the burden was removed from my system, but it is still going to be slow for a while.

Thank you for your patience."

,Dingman,2010-02-03T06:39Z,"Please seed if you like the programs.  I have been uploading these classes to thousands of people from all over the world over the last 2 years, and it can be very slow for them without the help of other seeders.

Thanks for your help, and God bless you too."
