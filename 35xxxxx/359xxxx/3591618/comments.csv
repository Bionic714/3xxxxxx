,birk.dk,2007-01-09T21:45Z,Thanks for this upload after having downloaded the maps and using the keygen to get activation code. How do I update the map on my GO700. Through TOMTOM Home or ? Thnx. 
,birk.dk,2007-01-10T17:08Z,Can someone help me with how to get the maps onto my GO700?
,tinus007,2007-01-12T14:54Z,"The maps can only be copied to the GO device. I connected the GO to the computer and copied the maps using Explorer to the GO root. You can't use the Home app, because the map files on the torrentsites are not install files (CAB) but can only be copied file-by-file. 

Just copy the complete folder containing the Map to the GO using Explorer. Start up TomTom and select the Map (Change map in settings). When TomTom asks for activation, it gives a Device Code. Wirte this down.

On the PC, only copy the MID file from the Map data to the folder containing the keygen. Open up a DOS box and go to the folder containing both key.exe and the Mid file. Enter key.exe nameofmap.mid. Program asks for device code, enter the device code, than program gives activation code. Enter this code without spaces into the GO.

Voila..."
,nomvel,2007-02-01T06:40Z,Thanks guys for your tips on map activation. I got the ttn6 working well on my treo 650. Now I need to maximise its use. Can anyone tell me where to download a ttn6 User Manual?
,crossbones,2007-02-02T11:33Z,"The activation code didn't work on my TTGO710 (Western Europe map 660.1256). I installed the new map alongside my previous Western Europe map and on starting up TT I get a choice of two Western Europe maps. Should I have deleted the old Western Europe map directory?

Or should I run the offical TomTom ttgo clear_flash utility? (What does it do?). TIA."
,jonkeplonk,2007-02-04T18:02Z,"I have the same problem as you Läski. 
The activation code is working with TT Home, but when the TT GO 510 is disconnected from the dock and starting up, it asks for the activation code once again. Tipping in the same code, but it returns the error message ""Sorry, this is not the correct activation code for the product 'Western_Europe'.""
Does anyone have a solution to this problem?"
,Robandnicky,2007-02-05T14:58Z,does anybody know of a version of tom tom 6 for my dell axim x5? please help
,Bhujang,2007-03-09T11:28Z,This didnt work for my TomTom One either. Used it on the western Europe maps 660
,paypal,2007-03-21T20:09Z,Couldnt get it to work for a Usa_and_Canada.mid file :(((
,CrazyEddy,2007-03-31T17:18Z,"Does anybody have the solution for the problem that some TomTom devices (in my case 710) give a the message that the Acitvation Code is invalid. I'm not using TomTom Home but I try to activate directly by typing the code in the device? Do I need to upgrade/downgrade the software or is the problem somewhere else? I'm trying to activate West Europe v660.1256 by the way.
In some other devices the codes work just fine."

,jonkeplonk,2007-04-02T22:12Z,"Thanks justass!

The Clear flash utility from TT homepage did the trick

I've got the western europ map working by:

1. Delete everything from the SD card using the MS Explorer

2. Wrote the TomTom_6_Western_Europe_660.1256 map using MS Explorer back on the SD card

3. Run and installed ClearFlash.exe

Removed the TT510 from the dock and started it, now it just worked. It didn't even ask for activation code. (?? don't know why??) "

,haelewyn,2007-04-29T22:20Z,"This is my story : Had a PDA Mio 168 before, with maps of Europe (the software with many different maps - one for each country). Bought a TT ONE Regional now since my PDA broke down. I am trying to use my old maps for the other european countries on it, but my TT One asks for an activation code. 
I read about the possibility to use a keygen program on this website. I am not used to working with torrent files so i did not manage to do it. Decided to download a crack using Limewire. I got a crack...   But it was fake and infected my ciomputer with a virus. I'm sure all TT staff will laugh at me now if they read this. OK...I am stupid. 
I would like to activate the old TT maps i have on the new device. They were sold without a code... It's old software - never had to use a code when i used the maps... Think at that time the activation code was not even invented by TT.
Can anybody tell me how to do it ? Do i need to activate each different map i will use on the new device (for every different country) ? Or would it be better to try and download the EUROPE map in one piece and then use the crack code ? Any help would be welcome.. If anybody can give me the crack, i would be glad to send you the number of my device.
Other idea: would TT give me a code in this case and would it be better to contact their helpdesk ?"
