I prefer this version by far: http://www.dimeadozen.org/torrents-details.php?id=123809&hit=1 



You'll have to register, but there's alot more miles available than what MASTER_NINJA has to offer. 



if this is the sum total of the sentiment about my miles collection then i won't bother !

,MASTER_NINJA,2007-02-02T20:09Z,"All of you should know that you are welcome to zappateers to get zappa shows. There are even other sites like dime and tradersden that are OK. Downloading them from here is OK, just remember to mention whoÂ´s version it is if you trade them. You should always mention source and who did the digital work. Many people collection zappa-shows cares about that. Just be honest and itÂ´ll be no problem.
