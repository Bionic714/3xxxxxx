Schysst att dela ut."

,wowjimi,2007-02-06T23:46Z,"yes, i do have brand new morning on vinyl ( all acoustic solos), and the album Seven (get out of denver studio version, etc).

I will get around to it within the next few weeks. 

I've had a problem with piratebay search not working for me so id like to see that fixed before i post here.  I want people to be able to find it.

Noah - i have somewhere on an old cassette tape - poor quality and a disappointing album, so i doubt if i will bother."
