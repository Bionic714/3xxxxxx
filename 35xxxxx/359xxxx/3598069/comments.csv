,taddict84,2007-01-18T05:21Z,"hey im just uploaded this torrent but it seems that im only able to seed at a rate of up to 45-50 kbps. For other torrents that I seed it only lets me go up to that amount. I used utorrent and i have the max at 100 and had it at 150 and also used the original bittorrent and still will only give me a max of 45-50. My router is the linksys WRT54G i think version 2 and all firm ware is up to date and i tryed to call and they really dont give help for p2p sharing. So if anyone has had this problem or knows how to fix it help me out so i can get this torrent going a little bit faster. 

Thanks taddict"
