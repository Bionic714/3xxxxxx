Only 3 is not seeded."
,Mikademus,2007-02-09T10:48Z,"DVD is broken, at ~1:30 or something into the movie the video stream breaks and the audio desynchs irrecoverably. I've CRC-checked the download and even re-downloaded the torrent, same result, it is the torrent (or rather the re-encoded video source VOB file) that is broken. 

There is another source out on the 'net, but it is unseeded and have been stuck on 93.7% for over a month :("
,kimi4812,2007-04-13T21:21Z,At 1:38 the DVD video stream breaks and the audio desynchs irrecoverably.
