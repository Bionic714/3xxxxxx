,cortic,2007-04-16T16:27Z,"can't get it to work, keep getting error 'The current program version is out-of-date. For the application proper work please download and install the new version...' when ever I try to run the thing,,, I had another (later) version installed but completely uninstalled it before installing this."
,cortic,2007-04-16T16:38Z,"My bad, it works, just got to say 'yes to all' when uninstalling.."
,SidDan80,2007-05-10T10:33Z,"No I cannot get this to work. I have also uninstalled every component from the previous version. After installing this and replacing the EXE file, also executing the reg file, it will just ask to install a newer version when trying to run it"

,chookymeister,2007-12-15T06:49Z,"i just dloaded the trial version, but didn't bother using when it said the video i was converting would hav a banner in the middle of it. so i switched to my favourite torrent website, thepiratebay.org, and found this fast torrent for the full versionid just got.
I love the internet"

,gary231178,2007-12-27T08:21Z,No this version does not work with vista. I even tried running it in windows xp compatability version with no avail.
,Les_Springs,2007-12-27T17:26Z,"Worked GREAT up until a month ago, before I installed some other video apps, then missing pthreadxxx.dll message appeared.  Uninstalling, cleaning reg, and reinstalling several times did not help.  Unable to search and find missing DLL file.  Trying to download later version now."
,anakin66,2008-01-28T23:27Z,"Can't get the program to work, whether it is this version where you just copy the files, or other versions with registry fixes. I install the program fine, but am then told the program won't run because it is outdated."
,seat98,2008-02-05T01:27Z,where is the crack folder?
,Beef_Grande,2008-02-06T04:16Z,"I copied the respective crack files, but when i started the program error stated that the program was out of date and needed updated from the AVS website.  How can I make this work?"
,GeorgeC525,2008-02-10T23:09Z,"Works fantastic, clean, no virus.
Thanks!"
,Sebihoorens,2008-02-27T10:35Z,Nice...
,dingmaster,2008-02-27T19:21Z,warning -This version does not work with windows vista
,Cricketman,2008-03-06T01:10Z,"Why not uninstall vista, install xp and use it like that?

Does it even work like that?"
,klimo007,2008-03-29T15:54Z,"Beef_Grande 

Solution: Format your PC

Reason:
AVS has put many registry keys in the windows register. Uninstall doesn't remove all those keys, therefore you keep problems after installing AVS again."
,ngorkzzz,2008-05-06T08:13Z,2 thumbs up for Lizav... Tnx great and working torrent...
