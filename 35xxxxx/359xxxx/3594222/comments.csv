That has to be the understatement of the century!!!"
,Straticus,2007-01-12T02:33Z,"LOL...you got THAT right, Fred...it's so outrageous it's almost surreal :)..."
,FredCPA,2007-01-12T13:36Z,"Oh, I forgot to thank you for your efforts and generous sharing!

While I already have this film, I'm very grateful that you put it up!

Why?  Because if people see it for themselves, I won't have to try to explain it to them!  In this case, seeing truly *is* believing!

BTW - I actually saw this in a theater when it first came out!  I really believe that I am still carrying scars from the shock.... ;)"
,Straticus,2007-01-13T11:54Z,"Fred, I also have Mondo Trasho, Eat Your Makeup and Multiple Maniacs...they're on VHS format, and I've been looking around to see about getting them transferred to digital, but I can't find a source...do you by chance know of anything I can do?? I'd LOVE to put those flicks up, because nobody would believe their eyes....In Mondo Trasho, Divine is killed by a monster called Lobstora, a gigantic Lobster...it's unbelievable :)...if you do know about this, please let me know so I can get them up!
