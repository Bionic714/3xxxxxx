Sketch Show is the current vehicle for former Yellow Magic Orchestra members Haruomi Hosono and Yukihiro Takahashi. The band was formed in 2002, when Hosono approached Takahashi with the idea. Similar to Yellow Magic Orchestra, Sketch Show's sound relies heavily on cutting-edge technology (synehesizers the first time, computers this time), but what sets the duo apart from thousands of other knob-twiddlers is the sense of songcraft and pop sensibility that they have consistently displayed over their careers. Both men sing and play traditional instruments in Sketch Show, with Hosono on bass and Takahashi on drums. Both men contribute vocals and sonic manipulations. While not genre-specific, Sketch Show's music is loosely categorized as electronica. In February 2003, the band released the mini-album Tronika, which featured remixes by Cornelius.
