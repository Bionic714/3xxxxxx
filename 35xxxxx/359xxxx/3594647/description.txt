NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC - TERMINAL VELOCITY (32mins.PAL)

This torrent contains two great movies about peregrines in uncompressed DVD format. A simple menu has been added, which (deliberately) appears after the
end of the film (or if you switch it on). The two movies have been joined.

PART1: (26 mins) NG: TERMINAL VELOCITY is the story of one man?s passion to see the unseeable and provide definitive answers to questions that have fascinated falconers and scientists for centuries. How fast can a peregrine really go as
it stoops towards its prey and how does it achieve these incredible speeds?

PART2: PEREGRINES IN NYC (6 mins) This short movie (from NG: Speed) is about peregrines living in New York City.

Programs: DVDDecypter + TMPGEnc DVD Author + DVDRebuilder
