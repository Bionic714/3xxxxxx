,chronick74,2008-02-18T01:57Z,This is not VBR. They are all CBR @ 128.
,z_Ghost,2008-08-29T06:28Z,"Just checking some of my torrents and had to reply to this 1. Dude I don;t care what your player says I ripped and encoded it, In fact the exact lame settings are

-b 128 -m s -h -V 3 -B 256 -q 1

How that equates to 128 CBR is beyond me ;)

either or hope you enjoy it."

Works great, had no problems.
It was also rapid.
I like not having to wait for forever for my music.
So, thank you."
