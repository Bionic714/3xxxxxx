[V],TurboKom,2007-01-05T19:31Z,And where are the remaining rar files????
[V],TurboKom,2007-01-06T00:25Z,"But thereÂ´s are missing some rar files, about half of them"
,oddballnl,2007-01-07T10:03Z,"When I unrar 1 of them, I get the same file as I get when I unrar them all.

My intention was to share this game with a friend, and I don't know if it's working, but otherwise he had to download 6.46 gig.

And it's definaltey not a virus, you can trust me on that."
,MainMan47,2007-01-07T18:19Z,"OK! Let me explain this to you... The reason why you got the whole game out of any file you tried to extract was that you still had all the rar-files in the same folder. If you had copied ONE rar-file to another folder, you would have gotten a request or the rest of the files. The reason for this is that the rar's are built together in a structure, and it always starts at volume 1. If this , or any other file, is missing, you won't be able to unpack it. So no... there's NO way around the 6 gig download, sorry..."

,Paxdax,2008-03-22T15:04Z,"Anyone who thinks this is the entire game a damned fool.

Download Common_Sense.exe"
,LezDawson,2008-08-17T15:27Z,"Absolutely agree with PaxDax.  I'm no expert, but I know you'd have to be a complete nob to think you'll have a full Medieval II in this one single little rar file.

Oddballnl is a bit naive (lets not be too hard on him - it's all a learning process) but he didn't realise that when he extracted from one rar, this automatically extracted from ALL the rars in the folder.

After all, what the fuck did he think the 6 gigs of data was for?

Any way Oddballnl, you should do yourself a favour and DELETE THIS TORRENT!  No one else is going to leech it - it's useless."
