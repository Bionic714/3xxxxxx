,soundwv,2007-11-21T01:27Z,"Could anyone explain the procedure to install these in English, pretty please? 

I'm half-way but I'm getting the error message ""failed to match with local machine hardware. To fix this situation please reactivate your license"" I don't think I'm following the procedure correctly. It's hard to understand in Spanish.

Thank you all"
,shabah71,2007-12-07T01:02Z,"Okay this is how I did it.

1. I run setup
2. I replaced the DXP.exe in the main directory with the the one in crack directory
3. I run the keygen program and used the license.ini file to creat the alf file
4. I'm not sure what to put infront of TransactorName=?????. Here I tried with my name.
5. I copied the alf file in the altum diectory
6. I start the program but the program turns off during the initialization period (I can se that the text licensed to ""name"". 

What am I doing wrong?"
