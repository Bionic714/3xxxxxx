MISC NOTES
This movie should play find in VLC or or Mplayer. I believe 5.1 output of HE AAC files in VLC is broken, but only playing two channels works fine. Most video players will automagically detect your preferred subtitle if you make a copy of it and save it as the same name as the video file, only with the srt extension. The video was denoised before being encoded so you may prefer to use a noise filter to hide the small amounts of color banding that can occur. 

Example:  
$ mplayer(.exe) myvideo.mp4 -vf noise=3t:3t
