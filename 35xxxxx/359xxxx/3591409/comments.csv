I've tweaked my ePSXe settings several times and nothing I do is getting it to work. The setting in the game are all correct as well and the music should be playing.  Can you give me suggestions please. The music is what makes this game so awesome to play otherwise I wouldn't bother with it,  any help it appreciated, Thanks. "
