With other downloads you'll often find links included to one poker-site or the other. ""Get 100$ for free"" and such. Nothing like that in this download.

Period."
,stratum,2007-01-11T21:01Z,As said above; SPAM - NO THANKS!
,Infil,2007-02-20T15:58Z,"I can confirm that this is NOT spam. Nice work, thanks! I'll be seeding."
,Hellion333,2007-04-10T04:59Z,"This is actually a well put together package! Thanks to the poster. The guy claiming pokerspam is a fish. We also call them calling stations, or ATM's, as they just love to give you chips. :)

Get this package if you want to learn to play poker well."
,Hellion333,2007-04-10T04:59Z,"Forgot to mention, come play me on Pokerstars.com same screen name."

,tomzy87,2008-04-13T10:16Z,"looks nice, can't wait to read the books, and i'll be seeding, though i think the best way to improve your play is by fliping cards not reading =)
