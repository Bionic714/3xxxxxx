Anyways, are people able to download this at all? One part of my program says it isn't uploading anything, but another says it is. If something is wrong let me know so I can try to fix it.

Thanks :D"
,Roxofff,2007-01-09T11:51Z,"This dosn't seem to be working, I've had it in my list for a while and I'm getting nothing coming down here.  Which is a shame, 'cos I'd love to take a look through this lot."
,chainreader,2007-01-09T20:32Z,"Don't give up on it, I haven't even had it up for a full day yet. I'm trying something else right now and I think it should work.

I'm going to make this work, it is too valuable to DnD nerds everywhere!"
,chainreader,2007-01-09T20:36Z,"And one thing I feel required to ask, although it should be left unsaid; please seed it for a while after you finish the download. I will most likely never take it down, but my little connection at best upload can only pull 28-45 KB/s which is ok for one person, but when more people are trying to download you know :D

So yeah, keep it seeding!"
,fusedfetus,2007-04-16T23:51Z,I've downloaded it almost to 60% and it stopped and hasn't restarted for a few hours. It says there are no peers to connect to. Can someone please help me out? I promise to seed for a few days after I get it downloaded.
,Phr34kn_Phantom,2007-10-20T06:04Z,"good stuff, good stuff! thanks"
,Asherrs,2007-11-21T18:16Z,"Awesome stuff man, but it's a bugger to download them all at the same time, would you be able to split it up a bit?"
,JaytheRed,2008-06-05T03:25Z,Good stuff man.... you are a god amoung supergeeks everywhere
,Perimones,2008-08-12T17:06Z,"Hi chainreader,
being that you look as much as dnd nerd as I am, maybe you have the old Monster Mayhem articles from the wizard website. I'm looking for the flesh-mulcher tree and the leanan sidhe. Both article are missing from their website. Been looking for them for a while.
P.S. Libris Mortis = incorrect Latin grammar, ha ha ha, funny (I used to be a Latin teacher)"
,Perimones,2008-08-12T17:18Z,"Should be ""Liber de mortibus"" or simply ""De mortibus"""
,Bertinator,2008-08-20T19:44Z,This needs more seeders. It's going between 0 and 1 KB/s.
,Fastler,2009-03-29T14:48Z,Do these PDFs have OCR?
,Kannios,2009-05-04T07:17Z,"hoping this all downloads, looks like a good amount of seeders on this one ^^ looking forward to having some new books :D"
,_Peetj_,2012-02-14T11:15Z,Thanks!!
