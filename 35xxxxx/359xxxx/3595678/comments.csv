,Belthelas,2007-06-09T00:43Z,"Got a quick question.  I've downloaded this ISO and mounted it with an emulator, but no idea what to do next.  If I auto-run, it opens up in Windows Media Player and is unresponsive.  I've tried browsing the CD for something that will run but to no avail.  I'm getting the feeling I'm missing something.  Please advise, thanks!"

,hojiliocknamikduk,2007-10-07T11:28Z,"this is a good torrent. i was able to download the installer and it worked perfectly, the Rosetta Stone installed and ready to go.
Just one problem. The language files cannot b found from the cd, no matter how i redo it. what do i do?"
,ConSeannery,2008-03-31T00:43Z,"belthelas:

read the torrent description man lol it tells you that you need the rosetta stone application.

""3) Install Rosetta Stone on your Windows PC with the install disk""

This torrent uses the rosetta stone V2 application, can be found on the piratebay"

,Noash,2008-10-26T14:57Z,"I need help! I do everything is mentioned but the program says that it can find information on the languages. What am I doing wrong???
I find a bit unclear what language files I have to burn on the disc so maybe I am doing something wrong...."
