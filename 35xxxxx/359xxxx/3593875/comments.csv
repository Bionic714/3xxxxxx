,InsaneMaster,2007-05-20T23:40Z,"Duuuuude, this is awesome. One of the very few cartoons ive actually enjoyed watching past the age of 10. Like most cartoons the plots for most of the episodes are very repetitive. This one doesnt get on my nerves tho :p

,clonetics,2010-05-17T00:15Z,"S03E14a: The Wind Whispers
S03E14b: They Must Be Giants

These episodes do not exist if you go to wikipedia and search for the list of episodes of courage the cowardly dog. Now, I know that they must be giants  (the band) did make a song about courage the cowardly dog, so maybe you're just confused about that. 

S02E12a: The House of Discontent
S03E11a: Dome of Doom
S03E11b: Snowman's Revenge
S03E13a: Kingof Flan

These episodes are available on another piratebay torrent, although I don't know if they're high quality or what."
,clonetics,2010-05-19T06:04Z,"I'd like to note that the episode entitled King Ramses Curse has its audio cut out at the end for about 1 min 40 seconds. And the quality was a bit lowish on that episode. Tried out three others that were quite high quality, so dunno what happened there. I'll just use the other torrent for the probably rare episode where something goes wrong."

The above torrent is better...and like ""clonetics""  pointed out has most of the missing episodes...so help yourself."
,hemi9288,2010-09-01T03:01Z,yah guys qbove torrent is better.
