,Hornpär,2007-01-09T10:15Z,What's the bitrate for files in this download?
,swec89,2007-01-09T21:44Z,"i think i need more harddrives :P

7.5TB is too little :P  "
,Harlez,2007-01-10T03:10Z,the bitrates vary between 128-320... only very few below 128. they're not all the same if you're wondering
,team2000,2007-01-10T16:32Z,seed please

,192691,2007-01-11T14:31Z,"Ive been downloading for maybe 2½ hours and im only on 9.8%, 555mb.
Seed..!"
,Harlez,2007-01-12T01:57Z,"i was seeding but for some reason i had to ""truncate existing files that were too large"" supposedly and now i'm at 98.8% (funny considering it's my torrent), all i need is a seeder for 30min to get back what i had lost. now i have that other 1.2% on my system but i just can't add them to make up for it... so one seeder would be helpful to me indeed and to everyone else since i was planning on seeding for a month"
,Lumic,2007-01-12T05:29Z,Harlez You Rulez i will see this a long time:)
,192691,2007-01-12T19:52Z,IVE BEEN DOWNLOADING THIS PEACE OF CRAP FOR OVER 24½ HOURS WHAT IS THIS?! IM STILL STUCK AT 53% AND IVE BEEN THERE FOR NEARLY 7 HOURS NOW?!

,cr0tchg0bblin,2007-01-13T10:40Z,As soon as i'm down dl this i'll seed for a week but in order for that to work sombody needs to seed
,Hornpär,2007-01-13T13:01Z,Try to hook up for a bit harlez and see if anyone got the missing parts. Besides you will help the rest to get to your point of state. Not that we may get a full copy but most songs will work. And then perhaps create a new torrent....idk
,192691,2007-01-13T14:04Z,"""Fel: Existing data file length too large [3594254>3590158]: C:\.........Techno & Trance + lots of it...\DJ Bomba - Pump & Pie.mp3""

,frettub,2007-01-14T23:20Z,"192691 and KLBN: Shut the fuck up!

You should be glad that you at least get this music for free, show some respect damn fools.

,Harlez,2007-01-20T03:23Z,If you dearly need 100% I have re-seeded it here http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3599439 hoping that I won't have to TRUNCATE any more files!

Please!"
,Harlez,2007-01-29T02:06Z,"Everyone is stuck at 98.8 because my torrent client decided some of my files where ""too large"" and had to truncate them... meaning delete them. Considering I was the only seeder at that point and was now at 98.8% I re-seeded it here! http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3599439

There are no seeders so you will never get 100%"
,XxingtonX,2007-02-28T08:30Z,"wtf, spent 2 days downloading to find out only 98.8% avaible, will someone with 100% plz seed for like 5 mins?"

,Coryf,2009-05-03T04:39Z,"mines also stuck on 98.8 but does that stop me from listening to the music? 

no it doesnt.

quitchur fucking bitching, 98.8% is close enough. you might be missing the last 3 seconds of the last song, boo fucking hoo."
,AbganExplor3r,2010-07-30T22:40Z,"""If your client is truncating files than I suggest you get one that doesn't. LOL! Besides, unless you edited the music files after you created the torrent, there's no way anything like this should be happening! For those whom are wondering; about a dozen songs are incomplete. If those are the ones you want; your stuck scouting them out in other torrents."""
