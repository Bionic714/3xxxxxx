,ostermark,2007-01-08T22:30Z,"It would be alot more easier to download, if people would seed. Im begging you SEED! Love Qlimax! Must have! :D"

Thanks for the great dvd:-D"
,rayman1981,2007-01-09T23:09Z,"armin only 2006 dvd?
i got it....

one of the best party's ever is defqon1

i've been to qlimax, sensation black and white and defqon1.

but defqon1 owns :) (when you dont like the music the girls are making it all up :D )"
,Goldenscan,2007-01-10T09:08Z,"i mean armin only 2 from 11.11.2006, not the ""next level"" from 12.11.2005. i already got this dvd...the other will come out next month or so...

oh man, there are so many great events...innercity, trance energy, sensation and so on...what got germany? mayday and nature one :/"
,rayman1981,2007-01-10T09:50Z,"i thought there is an new event in germany or in holland close to the german border: Q-base

yeah, netherlands rock with eletronic music/artists.

2 weeks ago i was drinking some beer with an friend in Breda and next to us stood Tiesto :)

that explained all that beautifull girls around us ;)"
,Goldenscan,2007-01-10T16:25Z,"tiesto? very naaaaaaays ;)

yeah, there was/is indeed the q-base, but in the north of germany...this would take about 5 hours to drive...i'm too old for that shit -.-

next big thing will be armada and cream @ amnesia ibiza. best trance-club in the world !!! nothing can beat the ice-cannon..."
,rayman1981,2007-01-10T18:04Z,"I was at qlimax 2006 and there were people from all over the world.
even americans (as u can see on the dvd), many people from east-europe and scandinavia and germany.

but when you look at defqon1 it is more an 100% dutch party, even when it is at least as good and better on some points.
and whats an 5 hour drive? get an cheap formule 1 hotel with some friends :)

,Mad_anne,2007-01-13T00:11Z,"Noooooo please, I cant believe it! It stopped at 96%! >."
,sirvondutch,2007-01-15T00:18Z,"These parties are the reason why i'm born and raised over here :P

Q-dance, respect! And tnx for the DVD, a bit more seeding would do me and others pretty good

I hope the quality is worth the waiting"
