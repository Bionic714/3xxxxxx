All the 272 Osprey historybooks in PDF-format that I have found on Demonoid, complemented with some extras found on TBP , that is aiming at interests before the 20:th century. 

WWII nerds have to make their own collection i guess ;) 

Please help seed since some of these books have been about to fade away out there lately.
