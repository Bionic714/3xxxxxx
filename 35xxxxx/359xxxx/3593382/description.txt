Mew: A Triumph for Man, ripped from the original CD release (not the 2006 remake).
I thought it would be fun for other Mew fans even though the remake is upped here already. 



Quote from Wikipedia:

A Triumph for Man is the first album by Danish band Mew, released in April 1997 by the Danish record label Exlibris Musik.

Only 2000 copies of the album were printed initially and prices for an original copy have reached upwards of $200 on auction site eBay[citation needed].

On September 18, 2006, A Triumph For Man was rereleased along with a cd with bonus material, including demos and acoustic versions of songs.
