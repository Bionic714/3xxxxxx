,infectedd,2007-01-15T13:30Z,No one found the ENus yet? damn =/ i need to download it
,Moze,2007-01-15T13:34Z,"World of Warcraft The Burning Crusade (US Retail Client) DVD iso

it's on mininova :S"
,infectedd,2007-01-15T13:41Z,thats the same file that was removed from TPB for being fake.
,Moze,2007-01-15T14:04Z,this file or the one on mininova?
,infectedd,2007-01-15T14:13Z,"the mininova one, this one is real, like the other"
,doomaxeao,2007-01-15T14:28Z,"yesterday i have downloaded 4x cd images of enGB TBC torrent but after i checked all cd's couldn't find any install or setup.exe file there was only folder names something with (os x)
if anyone can confirm that this dvd image is for windows and not for some other OS would be great.
thanks"
,Dem123,2007-01-15T14:56Z,"If you had read the comments of the other torrent you'd have seen that apparently the windows installer didn't carry over to the iso because he ripped it from a mac (was apparently invisible on a mac, as was the mac installer on a PC). The uploader uploaded a seperate fix that you could add to the iso to make it work for win.

I think this is sort of both torrents combined by someone else."
,catrix,2007-01-15T14:59Z,THIS is a DIRECT Copy from the DVD so EVERYTHING INCLUDED! all exe files...
,cowhunting,2007-01-15T16:21Z,"um i downloaded this DVD iso and mounted it, only to get the message ""This version of Burning Crusade is only compatable with the European English version of World of Warcraft.""

anyone else have the same issue"
,Moze,2007-01-15T16:31Z,"Thats cause this is the eu version, not the us"
,tkapower,2007-01-15T16:50Z,"how is it install? do i need a key for runit? 
"
,aged,2007-01-15T17:10Z,"Seems to work. The key you need is for activating your account for TBC online, meaning you should be able to install the game through this image and get a legit key elsewhere. "
,cowhunting,2007-01-15T17:13Z,"call me crazy but didnt the title originally say ""(US Retail version) and then after i posted it was the European version the torrent title changed"
,L4WL3RS34L,2007-01-15T17:36Z,"Catrix did the same thing with the other torrent. He just copied wikberget's installer.

,tkapower,2007-01-15T17:45Z,"is it somone here who has tryed this tbc and actual get it to work ? 
online .+ ??"
,Urpr0x,2007-01-15T18:48Z,"ok, so from what ive understand: 
enGB= euopean version, and usGB= us version?"
,Dem123,2007-01-15T21:18Z,"No. First 2 letters stand for the language, last 2 letters stand for the region.

enGB = English version for those in Europe (specifically Great Britain mostly)
enUS = US version"
