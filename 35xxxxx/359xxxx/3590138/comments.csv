Castbreeder
Castbreeder

In 1998 an album being passed off as a Prodigy release began circulating, entitled The Castbreeder. However, it was not an official Prodigy album, nor did it have anything to do with The Prodigy or their record label ""XL Recordings"". Many believed it to be a real release due to the high quality and craftmanship, but it is actually nothing more than a bootlegged compilation of various live and studio recorded tracks from the fellow big beat artists Junkie XL and Lunatic Calm. In fact, the music on the album is similar enough in style to The Prodigy's to have fooled quite a few people, however there were a few dead giveaways that the album was fake. The ""thanks to"" section was taken directly from the cover of Music for the Jilted Generation, and the wrong font for the XL Recordings clearly proved it to be a fake."
