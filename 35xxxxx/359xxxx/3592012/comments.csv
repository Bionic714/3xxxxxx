I really like country, but feel uncomfortable listening to this list. A top 500 of several other people would be really different from Shelly Fabian's."
,riley2010,2008-05-25T19:08Z,No 'Put Your Head On My Shoulders' by Paul Anka?!
,Geiiga,2008-10-09T18:12Z,"How do you put the Travis Tritt version of Great Day to Be Alive on a top anything list? There have been three versions of that song, the original by Darrell Scott, a cover by Cory Morrow, and then Travis Tritt's hack job on it. Seriously.

As a country fan myself, I have to say that only a couple of these songs are worth downloading for anything other than novelty versions (hey, remember that awesome Darrell Scott song? Here's Travis Tritt's shitty cover!)"
,cherokeegray91,2009-01-27T06:43Z,"This is great! I hope this helps all of you true country fans realize that Nashville country was good, and this is what it sounded like. Remember?"
,Newhack,2009-02-07T00:26Z,"@cherokeegray91
I remember as a kid bouncing around in the back seat of my dads chevelle (we didn't need seatbelts then) listening to this music and I love it, there's alot of good songs here but I also like conway twitty, who doesn't love george jones, mearl, john conlee, the list goes on and on thanks for the dl. and Ill seed 5 days LONG LIVE HONKEY TONK!"
