This release contains what is considered to be one of the best Computer 
Science courses in the world, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's
"Structure & Interpretation of Computer Programs", codenamed 6001.

It consists of a series of 10 2-part video lectures taught by Harold 
Abelson and Gerald Sussman, and the accompanying book.

The lectures are in DivX 3 avi format, and the book is in HTML format.

From the book's intro:
"This book is one of a series of texts written by faculty of the Electrical 
Engineering and Computer Science Department at the Massachusetts Institute 
of Technology. It was edited and produced by The MIT Press under a joint 
production-distribution arrangement with the McGraw-Hill Book Company."

The files are also available for download at http://www.swiss.ai.mit.edu/classes/6.001/abelson-sussman-lectures/ both via FTP and BitTorrent, but downloading 20 torrents is a bit tedious, so I gathered all of them in a single release.

Enjoy!
