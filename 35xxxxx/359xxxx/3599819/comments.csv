My seeding client is still hashing. As soon as it is done I will complete the files I started with the old torrent using the new torrent (and my own seeder)."
,talkinghead,2007-01-20T18:19Z,Thank you C-Otto for the fixed torrent!
,Malz,2007-01-20T19:43Z,"This site has couple PowerDVD 7 Ultra torrents but their serials are for Deluxe version. Only Ultra version has support for HD-DVD

So where you guys get the Ultra serial? I know that this a bit off-topic but the movie is useless if there is no proper software for it."
,7Wf5y6#^7HU3kYM,2007-01-21T02:57Z,I agree with Malz--where's a proper powerdvd release with HD DVD support?
,jobe1022,2007-01-21T05:25Z,Find on there are 3 goods ones out there.  PowerDVD is one. 
,Eventum,2007-01-21T08:58Z,Use Power DVD 6.5 HDDVD. Power DVD 7.xx require a HDCP-compatible GFX for HD-DVD vidoe playback...

,neomoon,2007-01-22T06:39Z,"Dowloaded this and I am seeding however I have run into some problems. 

Since one cannot install the HD-DVD version of PowerDVD 7.2 without having a HD-DVD drive connected (it defaults to the BD version) I only have PowerDVD 6.5 to play the .evo files.

When I try to load HD DVD file from harddisk I get an error message, and when I try to playback the feature1.evo file within  PowerDVD 6.5 it does not play back smoothly. Other then that this is a ver good release. "
[V],jnd,2007-01-22T10:17Z,"""uhm.... isn't this kinda big? 21.37 GiB is quite massive so to speak""

It's not so big for a 10 Mbps connection.."
,6g,2007-01-24T12:17Z,"PowerDVD 7.2 ultra installs bluray support by default.
To install powerdvd 7.2 ultra with hddvd interface, first delete pdvdbd? folder then rename hddvd folder into pdvdbd... then it will install hddvd version instead. "
,netgear64,2007-02-02T23:42Z,"I get only green and black stripes when I play this HDDVD, sound is ok.
I'm using PowerDVD 7.2 HD Edition.
Any idea whats wrong ?
Thanks for helping."
,sewe,2007-02-16T04:51Z,"""It's not so big for a 10 Mbps connection..""

duh.. doesn't help with a 10mb/s in-line, when ""none"" have a 10mb/s out-line.. 

in norway, the out-lines are stupidly small, like mine is 4000/400
and that means that 10 ppl have to seed to me so that i can download at max speed (500kb/s) "
,Fysle,2007-02-20T20:11Z,"Why don't you all just use the VLC-player? No problems.., easy to use, goes fine fine fiiiine"

,hyperion007,2007-02-25T00:13Z,"VLC does not work for me anyways. I can't get this to work AT ALL with any program. Well in VLC I do get the sound but that's it, not even a black screen only sound as if I was playing an audio file. Do you use Linux with VLC?"
