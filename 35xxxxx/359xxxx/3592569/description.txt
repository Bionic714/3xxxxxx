Marge a Homer Simpsonovi své d?ti milují - ale n?kdy jich mají prost? dost. Kdo by se jim proto divil, kdy? cestou na otravné rodinné oslavy narozenin strýce Tyrona v Ohiu zm?ní lehce sm?r a odletí spolu do Miami. Jaká to slast být spolu zas jen sami dva, starat se jenom o sebe, d?lat si, co cht?jí... Ov?em, v?eho do ?asu.

The Simpsons is an American animated sitcom created by Matt Groening for the Fox network. The television series is a spin-off of a series of animated shorts originally aired on The Tracey Ullman Show. The series is a satirical parody of the Middle American lifestyle epitomized by its title family. It lampoons many aspects of the human condition, as well as American culture, society as a whole and even television itself. The Simpsons has also had a significant influence on post-Cold War popular culture. The show has also been cited as an influence on many adult-oriented animated series in the late 1990s, such as South Park, Futurama, and Family Guy.
