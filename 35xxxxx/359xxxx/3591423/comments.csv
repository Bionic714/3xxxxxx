,m2c,2007-02-04T23:00Z,Either burn to a DVD as iso image or mount it in daemontools http://www.daemon-tools.cc/dtcc/download.php?mode=ViewCategory&catid=5

,TheTwistOfCain,2008-02-24T18:40Z,"This is what the site sais:
"" The SI Stand-alone application has been installed. You must install the SI Stand-alone data before using the SI Stand-alone application.""

how the phuck do i do that? anyone?"
,wcs2059,2008-03-03T05:37Z,"I got this to work just fine...if anyone is still having issues, run the video in the VIDEO_GUIDE directory (after you've created the dvd) and follow all the instructions."
,Larry767,2008-03-03T17:36Z,"This is awesome.  If anyone has access to a newer version of this DVD, please consider sharing it.  Would also be great to get access to the online informaiton on GM's website.  What about Ford or Chrysler manuals?  Would be awesome to get those too.

Thanks for the share."
,goodman08,2008-03-15T14:05Z,"Hi!

I have the same problem as ""Thetwist ofchain"", no problem til install, but to open. Message:
"" The SI Stand-alone application has been installed. You must install the SI Stand-alone data before using the SI Stand-alone application.""
And that's it. What now?"
,ChevyHoe,2008-03-27T19:00Z,"There have been some problems with the install.
For instance, the first time I installed it everything worked fine, but then I uninstalled, and all hell broke loose.
Got the same error as mentioned above.

Haven't really figured out why, but this seems to do the trick:

1. Restart the computer, and do not open any applications.
2. Insert/mount the DVD.
3. Follow the instructions on screen
4. Once finished, open the DVD with Windows Explorer and copy the folder named Copy_to_HardDrive to your desktop. (In some cases, it works better if you copy the folder to the destination folder (ex: C:/Program files/GM SPO))
5. When finished copying, remove the DVD and open the Copy_to_HardDrive folder.
6. Double click SETUP
7. Follow the instructions on screen
8. Installation is now complete. Delete the Copy_to_HardDrive folder.


PS: In some cases, it has helped to copy the folder to another harddrive. 
Dunno why it happends, but I've got it working on both of my computers now.

And no, I haven't downloaded this one yet, so I don't know the instructions in this DL.
Got mine from a ""friend"" off eBay a long time ago.

Hope this'll help you get it up and running :)"

,zigzag644,2008-05-07T03:16Z,"How to install:

1) Download, burn ISO to DVD or mount volume.

2) Run the installer, but don't run the program afterwards.

3) Browse the DVD to the folder SI_DATA and run the SI_DATA.EXE self-extracting RAR file.

4) Extract the files to a temp folder on your hard drive.

5) Start watching a movie while the files unpack. Check back half-way through the movie.

6) Run the SETUP.EXE file in the temp folder and use the default path settings (C:\Program Files\GMPRO\eSI\). 

5) Finish watching the movie, the final setup should be complete.

6) NOW run the program. 

This worked for me.  Watching a movie is optional to those who prefer the excitement of staring at a stalled setup dialog window and a flickering HDD light."
,grunsel,2008-10-07T05:34Z,"Problem when I run program is says:

,kccode1,2009-06-08T14:09Z,"This is awesome!  I only needed one manual for the car I just bought, but this is great.  Now I have all of them.

No virus and Installed perfectly.

I will seed for a while. I have good bandwidth. "
,funforus,2010-02-07T19:41Z,"So does this run on Windows 7, or is there an updated version?"
,ozc,2011-03-24T19:49Z,"It works in Windows 7 Home Premium 64bit but you need to take the following steps.

-Disable UAC with TweakUAC (maybe maybe not)

-copy msvcr71.dll from the java's directory into \GM SPO\eSI\Apache Group\Tomcat 4.1\bin 

-go to admin tools > services > SI Tomcat and start it.

-enable UAC if you had to disable it.

-Restart. 

Working for me right now, should still work after I restart.

Someone really needs to crack a new version of eSI..."
