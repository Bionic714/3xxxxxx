,gazcoo,2007-02-27T17:43Z,"yeah, please seed (or reseed), we're all stuck at 87%!"
,mode_m,2007-03-05T04:14Z,"Seed Please, I noticed someone was seeding the other day but then stopped before I could finish."
,#digitaltv,2007-03-07T03:46Z,this is the last re-seed i will do. if you guys can't keep torrent going to bad :)
,Pericarpist,2012-04-11T22:07Z,"if anyone still has this there are at least 28 people who would really appreciate a reseed for the last 7.7%, the first 6 eps are 100% but that just leaves me craving more!  If I ever finish this torrent I'll be sure to keep a folder in case the seeds go down again.  I am in the middle of ripping season 2 from ilaugh.com and I will be sure to post it once it's ready but the quality of this (appears to be a DVD rip?) torrent is much better.  also, i found a way to watch hulu in canada but it is a big adsupported-software hassle and that seems like the only way to access season 3 and the canadian president in this country o_0  i had no luck ripping from hulu (I'll try screen capture if necessary) so i'd be indebted to anyone who posts season 3 and/or the canadian president.  this is truly a great series even years after it ended i hope we can help it get a decent following so we can at least keep a few torrents going.  thanks guys!"
