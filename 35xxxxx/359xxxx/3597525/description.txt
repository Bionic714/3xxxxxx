This is a counter-video to the first edition of "9/11 Mysteries". Using their own video and words, "Screw 9/11 Mysteries" aims to point out not only the bad science used in the film, but also the several accounts of lying, quote mining, tricky editing and strawman arguments.

NOTE: There may be some grammatical errors in this video. Everything was spell-checked but I can't promise anything.
