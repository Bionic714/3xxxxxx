So sad... what's next, ""Screw JFK""...? ""Screw The Holocaust""..? ""Screw Titanic""..? Why not ""Screw the Big Bang""?

You've lost all credibility."
,Sovare,2007-01-19T16:32Z,"Ummm All_your_sky Im not quite sure you understand what this video is about.

Its a counter to the infamous ""911 Mysteries"" that claimed that the 911 attacks were made by Bush / NWO and not by Al Quaida and that explosives were used to bring down the two towers (and WTC7)

,Sovare,2007-01-19T16:35Z,"Oh, and FlyingHamster - I put the link in the info just so that people like yourself could put forward their views in a civilized mannor. You are most welcome.
"
,All_Your_Sky,2007-01-19T17:08Z,"Mmmmm, I understand perfectly what this ""video"" is about - it supports ridiculous claims (lies) and try to defy the laws of physics.

Sorry kid, but the laws of physics are the strongest laws there are - you cannot break them, no matter how hard you try."
,All_Your_Sky,2007-01-19T17:48Z,"Oh, yeah, I forgot.. Make a video called ""Screw the Solar System"" where you will claim that ""the Sun actually revolves around the Earth and not the other way around... Science is wrong... the old kings were right!!"" 

Ohhh, or how about a little video where you will say that ""the planet is actually not round.. we've all been wrong, it's flat!""

But then again, perhaps it's just a liiiitle bit too late to try and cover stuff like THAT up!"
,Sovare,2007-01-19T18:12Z,"You definately got it wrong All_Your_Sky. Or you think that something about the offical explanation to the 911 attack is wrong, and if so you are more than welcome over to Jref and propose this.

Cheers,

,Steve_Verrone,2007-01-19T19:13Z,hmm i think i'm gonna go hijack a russian airliner tomorrow and fool the whole russian military and intelligence agencies and fly it into the kremlin (and watch the whole building explode instantly or something) ... i know i can do it too because i even played with toy airplanes when i was small
,shufflemaster,2007-01-19T21:02Z,"The New York Firefighters, NYPD, the WTC survivors and the families of the victims of 9/11 are with Al-Qaeda since they question the official story!! Argh, they're all dangerous terrorists!! 

Better put them away in the new shiny FEMA detention facilities, and why not torture them while we're at it! Just like in 24 and Sleeper Cell...!"
,PerryLoukeh,2007-01-20T03:33Z,"Hmmmmmmmm, i don't think it's a coincidence that the uploader's name is Sovare... the Swedish word for ""sleeper"" is ""sovare"".. 

He's likely some cheaply paid off disinfo-terrorist employed by the Globalists to make a pathetic last ditch attempt to put people ""back to sleep"". 

I kinda feel sorry for the poor fellas like Sovare, their jobs must be pretty tough, what with all the gay prostitute rings whatnot that they're all involved with, for example........"
,Sovare,2007-01-20T12:27Z,"""He's likely some cheaply paid off disinfo-terrorist employed ""

You guys really are paranoid aren't you. 

Oh and could I have a link to that ""scientific poll"" Xeinge72 talked about.

No bother, Ill PM him.

,JazonX,2007-01-20T15:01Z,"Here for the full poll data: http://www.angus-reid.com/admin/collateral/pdfs/polls/NYT_October2k6.pdf

Be warned! The above is not for children!

Just one of countless articles reporting on it: http://www.angus-reid.com/polls/index.cfm/fuseaction/viewItem/itemID/13469

However, polls are unnecessary - any person with an inteliigent mind and who can think for themselves, can quickly figure out that 9/11 is a total inside job. Many New Yorkers realized it on the very same day as the planes struck the buildings."

Nope, thats not the poll that says:

quote = All_your_sky
According to the latest scientific polls, only 16% of the US population believes that the government is telling the truth about the events that happend on 9/11 2001.

Guess the other 84% must be working with Al-Qaeda then.
/quote

This poll says that only 16% think that Bush is telling the whole truth about his foreknowledge about upcoming attacks. That is, the events *prior* to the 11/9 attacks. Eg its about if he is trying to cover his own ass regarding what he knew Al Quaida was up to.

It even says so at the link your provided:

quote=Angus Reid.com
Only 16 per cent of respondents say the government headed by U.S. president George W. Bush is telling the truth on what it knew prior to the terrorist attacks, down five points since May 2002.

,whitedingo,2007-01-23T09:14Z,"
Conspiracy theories are a known form of Fascist, even Stalinist propaganda.   The KGB admitted to using and spreading various AIDS conspiracy theories as has the CIA about UFO conspiracies, in its propaganda war against the Soviets.

Hitler and the Nazi's employed conspiracy theories to blame Jews, Communists, Masons and so forth for the very activities the Nazi's themselves were engaged in.

The dictator Stalin did likewise.

Note the irrational and fanatic zeal displayed of conspiracy theorists here. It is indicative of their neo-fascist ideology and irrational psychological profile.

Go to any Far Right, neo-Nazi, White/Islamist Supremacist, Islamo-fascist website and conspiracies form a core diet and staple for their hate propaganda.

Thanks to the uploader for forwarding a calm, cool and rational response to the barking mad ravings and complete lies of conspiracy fanatics.

The reason these fearful, paranoid, ignorant conspiracy freaks are in a frenzy and frenetically shouting down this information, is because it exposes their lies and disinformation tactics.   

They don?t want you see it.  They are afraid of being exposed.

Get this release, watch it and see how conspiracy charlatans, like religious tricksters, lie, promote hoaxes, fabricate and distort facts and evidence with their smoke and mirrors deceptions.    

You will quickly realise these virulent fanatics are the very things they viciously accuse the U.S. and its American citizens of.   

Take a peek and see what conspiracy zealots are trying to cover-up and keep you from finding out folks!"
,lazlo4,2007-02-15T13:10Z,"You got all backwards Whitedingo...
If you canÂ´t see that were moving towards a fascist state then since 9/11 then yourÂ´e in denial or just ignorant, wake up!"
,OMGClayAiken,2009-01-22T18:06Z,Haven't seen it yet but all three buildings were brought down in a controlled demolition. You cannot argue about that. There's no way in hell a building can fall like that just because of the damage from fires. But I'm looking forward to see this one. Thnx Sovare.
,angryheathen,2009-02-09T01:47Z,"Just saying that a tall building can't fall down because of damage from fires is not an argument.
You have to supply proof as there have been collapses due to fires before.

There is actually no CT argument left about 9/11 that has any credibility."
