The tape is always running, and when pilots encounter what they believe are UFOs, the black box aboard every aircraft captures the moment. For the first time, THE UFO FILES reveals actual cockpit and control tower recordings of these sightings. From a detailed account of the 1947 Arnold case, to recent recordings over New England and Texas, to NASA recordings and video from 2005, BLACK BOX UFO SECRETS features interviews with pilots, witness and experts, including UCLA\'s Joseph Nagy, actor Ed Asner, and pilot/UFO researcher Don Berliner.
