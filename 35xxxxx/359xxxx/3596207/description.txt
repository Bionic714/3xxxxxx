High on Crack Street: lost Lives In Lowell

Once a thriving manufacturing center, Lowell Massachusetts provides
case study in the aftermath of the factories closing down. It follows
three longtime residents, Boo, Brenda, and Dickie, all of whom are
hooked on crack. They move in and out of rehabs, crack houses, and
jails, hopeless and lost. Great moments of true realistic drama.
\"Cinema veritÃ©\" of superb quality. No guidance, no judgment, just
direct observation. Its like a fly on the scene! Great documentary,
very rare and hard to find.
