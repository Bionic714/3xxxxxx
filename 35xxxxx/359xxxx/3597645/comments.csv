,FSDude,2007-01-17T17:00Z,"Does anyone else get CTD's when using these sceneries? I think they look great, but on two different installs I get random CTD's."
,namestain,2007-01-17T17:15Z,"If I knew what a CTD was I would definitely tell you

;-)

not a newbie, just getting old and not so good with the TLAs . . .

Thanks
Dr. Frikadel"
,Dr. Frikadel,2007-01-17T17:29Z,"CTD's (crash to desktop or FS just quits on you)
were sometimes present. Ouessant was famous for it's CTD's. Go to the support section of FranceVFR and download the several available patches. That should do the trick...:)

,FSSR.Keyno,2007-01-17T17:33Z,"CTD=Crash To Desktop
FSDude, yes i have, in the past, think it was caused by Quiberon, the island scenery. Might be a mesh conflict."
,namestain,2007-01-17T17:42Z,"I learn something new everyday here !

definitely suffered the occasional CTD but haven't analysed whether driven by a particular scenery. Danke herr D F und Herr Keyno."

,neslesman,2007-01-18T02:17Z,"Rhadamantys you will find the free St. maarten scenery att Avsim or whatever is far better than the France VFR one.  Secondly, as has been so suitably pointed out, you just have to go back a day or so and download the one you want."
,ssreaper,2007-01-18T05:33Z,"Thanx

Req.. LLH upgrade (for integration with France VFR - Flight Alps - Basepack NORD)

Been putting out the word about Just Planes Air Greenland.  Forgive me if you have run into this request a few times - just spreading out the alert.  30 folks are stuck at 28.4%.  It's been about 5 weeks, maybe more and patiently we are all hoping for a hero to jump in and save the day.  Anyone and Everyone that hears and helps - Thanks 10,000 times.  PB Seeders are AWEsome.  BEV was requested and less than 1 Day (!) later PB came forward and seeded.  Thnx!"
