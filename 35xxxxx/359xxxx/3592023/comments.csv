Donno what TOR (goal?) means but thank you very much. Or do you mean The Onion Routing network :)

Am I the only one? Try to redownload..

[T],stevekasian,2007-01-08T11:13Z,"I meant the latter (Onion) - cool shit.

What type of error is it - a winrar error or a mounting error? Either way it works 4 me.

,Dr. Frikadel,2007-01-08T11:36Z,"No problemo Sir Steve, I just redownloaded it and all is well now. It was indeed a Winrar error while extracting.

Thanks,
Dr. Frikadel"
[T],stevekasian,2007-01-08T11:46Z,"For those who don't know how to use it, just copy & paste all the checksum info into notepad, save it as a filename ending in "".md5"" (as opposed to .txt) into the directory where you downloaded the .rar file or wherever else you may choose.
Once the .rar file (""Aerosoft Scenery Germany 1 (With Serial) - Repack By 108.rar"") is decompressed:

Mount the image by selecting the .cue file.
Open up UltraISO (or other like app).
In UltraISO, select Tools/Verify CD-DVD Checksums.
In the CD/DVD Drive field, select your virtual Drive you just mounted the image on.
Then in the ""Checksum File"" field, select the MD5 file you just created.
Then select ""Verify"".

Then you'll find out real quick if you got a corrupt copy or not.
Good luck!"
[T],stevekasian,2007-01-08T11:51Z,"Cool. Well, anybody else out there interested in this info., please take note. READ and LEARN. Then you won't have to ask people for tutorials on hash checking/whathaveyou when the day come that you need to do it.
TAKE NOTES WHEN YOU GET VALUABLE INFORMATION HANDED TO YOU!! :-) Copy and paste all this shit I just wasted my time typing out into a textfile called MD5 Checksuming or some shit and save it in a special information folder on your computer somewhere. ;-)"
,allen_x,2007-01-08T12:08Z,"I can confirm that it works, thanks."
,duder1,2007-01-08T12:09Z,"you didn't waste your time posting that info steve.  I never really had the need to do an MD5 hash check, so I never really looked into how to do it.  Now I know.  Thx 4 the info.

I didn't even download the scenery. lol"
[T],stevekasian,2007-01-08T12:20Z,"Nice 2 C someone is reading these comments... lol  Freakin lazy n00bs.
You are VERY welcome!"
,Dr. Frikadel,2007-01-08T13:01Z,"What's the matter Sir Steve, didn't have a good night sleep? it's all appreciated. Know that!
