,zalowishus,2008-07-15T06:53Z,"The sources most of been real crap because now you have MP3's w/ a bitrate of 320 and high quality crap.
I haven't listened to all of the CD's yet but the 3.5  out of the 8 that I have - the sound is like an old dirty LP w/ cracks and pops or tinny and hissing. The bass level has been ""remastered"" as Trotyl has said, and it is SO high that it's distorted....yeah it's free, but I already own most of these CD's (and they don't sound like this) and the sound of this download is not worth it unless you'r mostly deaf."
