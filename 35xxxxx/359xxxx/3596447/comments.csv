Does everybody erase all subs except their own language or what?

Is it too much to ask to leave all the subs, or were there no other subs available?"

I leave all the subs always.

In this edition only english and spanish subtitles. Sorry.

You don't need to know anything about dvd structure or have any 3000$ software, just do it step-by-step like suggested in guide using free software."
