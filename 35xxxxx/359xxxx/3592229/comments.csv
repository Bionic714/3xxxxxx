,monk1,2007-01-14T19:34Z,How is it possible? AFAIK 9th series starts on 28.01.2007 and this is already the best of whole season? I think its the best of 8th series or a fake - tell me if u know.

I watched the 'new' RR, plus a Brit explorer, but that was from the previous series. Sorry. I'd expect the new series to make a big deal about the Hamster's recovery from his jet car crash, so that will be something to look out for as an identicication of new stuff."
