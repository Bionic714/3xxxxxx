Essinth's Furry Art Collection. January 2007.

The best of the best, from Essinth's point of view. If the picture's content is good, but drawn badly, it gets trashed. If the picture is drawn well but that's just it - only drawn well, it gets trashed, too. 

The collection is categorised, 0 means non-adult and mostly safe for work, everything above - adult. Which category picture belongs to was intuitively chosen, no strict rules.
