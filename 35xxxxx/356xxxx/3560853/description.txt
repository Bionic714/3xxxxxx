Short Story
------------

Got bored and had to do something....



Longer Story
-------------

This is a repack of Sim Traffic 2006 v1.0 Beta by KEIRON


I had some time over so i made this repack of this traffic pack
by KEIRON. I made some fixes like cleanup, renaming, and removal
of duplicates. And i added some features. Read more about it below.
The download is a bit bigger tough, but you get a better installer.

Required HDD space on install is still approx 5.33Gb



Things thats got changed:
--------------------------

- Recompiled 213 traffic files (.bgl) into 1 (one) traffic file instead.

- Removed duplicates aircrafts, airports and flightplans.

- Cleanup and renaming of AI aircrafts folders.

- Changed the Bangkok airport from VTBD (Don Muang) to VTBS (Suvarnabhumi)
  in schedules as VTBD (Don Muang) has been closed since 27 September 2006
  in real life. There is also a good freeware airport in this package,
  VTBS 2006 Project by siamavsim, as VTBS dont exist in FS9 by default.

- New installer that takes care of some more work for you.
  (Installing and uninstalling of AI aircrafts and traffic file in FS9)



Hope you all enjoy it!
