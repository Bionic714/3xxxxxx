Ever wondered who the real terrorists is?

BBC Timewatch reveales the truth about the NATO and CIA sponsored terrorist organisation named Gladios (Italian for Sword). Operation Gladio was a group of stay behind operatives that would infiltrate radikal orginisations and use them to discredit the socialist movement in Europe after the Second World War.

It sometimes even resorted to false flag terrorism and the alleged murder of the socialist friendly stateman Aldo Moro in Italy.

Bare in mind that NATO was once run by Lyman Lemnitzer the man behind Operation Northwood.
