You kids better help out seeding this.

In a few days or so, 
I'll rip the Final Fantasy X OST in EAC with Secure mode to .MPC as well, and upload it."
,Osaka,2006-11-23T10:57Z,"For other Final Fantasy soundtracks I've ripped, check this list of torrents: http://thepiratebay.org/user/Osaka

Or just search after ""EAC-MPC""

All of them are ripped in Exact Audio Copy with Secure Mode enabled.

Remember to seed after you're done downloading.

Just leave the torrent running.
And don't move or delete the .zip files."
,Osaka,2006-11-28T22:15Z,"The FFX OST will be delayed.
It will probably be ready and uploaded sometime this week though."

,Osaka,2006-12-13T03:47Z,"I'm currently seeding this: http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3575057/

So I won't have any time to seed anything else, including the Final Fantasy soundtracks (or the Silent Hill OSTs for that matter) for some time now.

Please seed all the FF soundtracks after you've downloaded them for at least a few days, or weeks even, if you can."
,XTZGZoReX,2006-12-17T16:00Z,well i got to reformat these since a mp3players cant play mpc..................................
,Osaka,2006-12-22T15:02Z,"Get a portable player that supports MPC...

Don't re-encode to another format, it will make the quality baaad.

Sadly, MPC has little support on portable players as of today, but there are more and more players being made that support it. And they should, since mp3 is a rather dead format."
,Zea Moore4,2007-01-19T18:45Z,"First of all, mpc files does not work on most media players like winamp, win mediaplayer of Quick time. be shure u can play this before u download it."
,Osaka,2007-01-20T01:03Z,"It works perfectly on all Winamp versions.

Foobar2000 also supports it by default."
,dbsanfte,2007-04-18T11:14Z,"Please stop .zipping up PRE-COMPRESSED files into a monolithic .zip. Just add the individual files themselves to the torrent.

People do not keep hugeass .zips around on their drives for long, despite your pleading. They will, of course, keep around the individual files, so just pack the files themselves into the torrent."
,Osaka,2007-04-30T13:33Z,"dbsanfte, you don't seem to understand much... and you don't seem to have much experience with making torrents either.

The reason I zipped it is NOT to compress it further (duh), but rather just BECAUSE I made a torrent of it... 

If you don't zip it, most people will just download all the songs then MOVE the files to another location (such as their music folder), thus rendering the torrent un-seedable from their side.

A zip will remain and when they unpack the files they can move them around how much they want and still be able to seed and share back.

This is a proven FACT. 

You're free to have whatever OPINION you want about it, but that won't change the facts, sorry."
,Osaka,2007-07-28T02:55Z,"Yeah, well... thanks. I don't like aXXo though.

I want/need the FF9 soundtrack.

If someone could make a perfectly lossless 1:1 copy of it, as either .wav files or back it up with FLAC with Exact Audio Copy and Secure Mode that would be great...!!

I've been searching around for it. Can't find it.

And I can't buy it either because it's not sold anywhere where I live.

I'm willing to trade a 1:1 copy of the FF9 OST for a 1:1 copy in FLAC of either the FF7 or FF8 soundtracks, or both, if someone would upload FF9 in lossless. 

Oh yeah... if someone has it and don't know what to do, here's a simple guide: http://wiki.hydrogenaudio.org/index.php?title=Create_a_lossless_back-up_with_EAC_and_Flac"
,Osaka,2007-08-23T04:06Z,"I found the FF9 OST in lossless and made a torrent of it:

http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3780474/

SEED IT!"
,Mr. Master D. Evil,2007-11-05T22:03Z,"I would love all of the FF OSTs in Lossless! =)
I miss for example disk 3 of FFVII's OST! (I have disk 1,2,4) =P
Final Fantasy VIII, VI, V, IV would be awesome too... sure if u got em, any others! ^^"
,Osaka,2007-11-07T03:52Z,"For Final Fantasy 1-6 in lossless... 

...you can go to OCRemix.org and search for ""Final Fantasy IV"" for example, 
then go to ""Chiptunes"" and you will be able to download the original songs.

From OCRemix: 

""Chiptunes, as well as sample-based formats like RSN/SPC for the SNES, 
allow you to replay the original soundtracks to many of your favorite games.""

Since it uses the same format as the songs use when they are stored on the original cartridges it's pretty much lossless.

It's sort of pointless to have FF1 to FF6 in FLAC... the space is just not worth it.

I personally own the following FF soundtracks:

Final Fantasy VI Original Sound Version
Final Fantasy VI Grand Finale
Final Fantasy VII Original Sound Track
Final Fantasy VIII Original Soundtrack
Final Fantasy IX Original Soundtrack Plus
Final Fantasy X Original Soundtrack
Final Fantasy S Generation

I only uploaded FFX in FLAC because it was a special request AND I traded it for something else...

The FF9 soundtrack I uploaded because it's terribly hard to find it, at all, so after I found it on eMule I 
thought it would be nice to make a torrent of it because no doubt other people are also looking for it.

I don't feel like uploading the other soundtracks because there's no point really.

I've got better things to use by bandwidth for.

And I made the FF6, FF6 GF, FF7, FF8, FF10 OSTs available as high bitrate MPC files...

Which SOUNDS like lossless 99% of the time, but it's much smaller.

And due to the simple nature of the music in FF6, compressing the audio doesn't destroy the quality.
At least not noticeably. In FF7, the audio was done in a more advanced and better way, but it's still 
pretty simple and not so complex. FF8 is much better but it still isn't terribly complex.

The FF10 audio is harder to compress... but the actual OST itself was very poorly mastered.

I mean, when they recorded it, they messed up on the sound quality. The audio is too loud.

The Advent Children OST is a another good example. It sounds horrible, quality-wise.

Sooo, yeah... If you absolutely must have some FF soundtrack in lossless, just try eMule.

You'll probably find it there, whatever it may be...

Try searching for example:

Final Fantasy APE
Final Fantasy FLAC
Final Fantasy Wavpack
Final Fantasy Lossless

...and make sure you search for ""Archives"" only.

Use your imagination..."
,indobjork,2008-04-19T16:32Z,Anybody got the FF7 Crisic Core OMST? Got awesome tracks.
,niji,2008-04-22T22:53Z,thanks
,LunarHigh,2008-06-04T05:21Z,"uh...well dude I appreciate you taking the effort to put this up...but why would you use a format that regardless of it's superiorty, isn't utilized by 97% of portable players and computer apps? I mean...WTF....how many millions of people have ipods or MP3 players? I am trying to dl this so I can put it on my ipod/iphone if I wanted to listen to any track on my computer I'd just do it through youtube. Not trying to sound like a dick but it just doesn't make any sense to me."
,Rakzor,2008-06-07T22:45Z,"Not trying to flame or anything, but why use a format that isn't widely supported? The little quality that you gain using MPC is outweighed by virtually nobody being able to actually USE it."
,theultramage,2008-06-28T20:07Z,"At this high bitrate/quality, the difference from the original should be minimal, so feel free to re-encode to mp3 yourself. You won't notice the difference over cheapo' headphones anyway.
I myself prefer the latest m4a technology.

Why use something different than MP3? MP3 is a poor format that's been around for 15 years, and the only positive thing about it is its low complexity (=> battery time). Maybe it's time to finally start moving on to something better?"
,dickbutt,2008-07-30T11:41Z,i love not seeding.
,Osaka,2008-07-30T20:14Z,"
@ Rakzor and LunarHigh

""virtually nobody being able to actually USE it.""

Uh...

EVERYONE can use it.

The only time you might have problems playing MPC is on a portable player. However, many new players support MPC. 

But regardless, if you're gonna listen on an iPod or something similar, then you will most often do so outdoors, or in a very noisy environment; so you may as well go grab some crappy MP3 encoding somewhere because you won't hear the difference...

People like you are like people who refused to change from tapes to CDs.

@ dickbutt (wtf?)

There are seeders, retard...

Or do you mean you love to leech and not contribute?"
,footinass,2008-12-30T19:36Z,will this work on wmp?
,footinass,2009-01-01T00:58Z,"hehe thx man i dloaded foobar2000 and it works great!




HAPPY NEW 1984?!?"
,Kylezo,2009-03-11T11:40Z,"MPC might be *vastly superior* to mp3 or whatever but...

cmon...NOBODY uses MPC. I'm just gonna end up converting them to mp3 anyways to put on my mp3 player.

I encode direct to mp3 from EAC using hi bitrates and it sounds fine. 320 CBR mp3 is practically transparent anyways.

Of course, I have plenty of FLAC laying around, and my mp3 player won't play that either... :P call me a hypocrite ^_^"
,selenar,2009-06-02T22:51Z,"Agh! Why do so many people rip to some lossless codecs no one has ever heard about (making the file size 5x larger), then be a snob about it, saying that MP3 sucks, is ancient etc., and after that, PRETEND they can hear the difference between the two formats.

I mean, come on, 97% of people don't have bionic hearing, and simply can't tell the difference between good old 192-320kbps MP3 and FLAC.

OK, downloading now, ha ha ha."
,SPFAR,2009-07-09T01:25Z,"Another codec, another problem.

I have m4a, flac and wmv. They have one problem in common, it doesn't play in my car radio or mobile phone.
I do however enjoy the quality as I listen to it on my pc.
But seriously, they should stick to one standard. When I buy music, I want to stick to a standard that is able to play in any kind of medium and, of course, has the highest possible quality."
,AbsolutZero,2009-08-21T05:14Z,i was wondering how one would convert mpc to mp3 so that one could put it on one's mp3 player?
,badprenup,2009-09-02T20:13Z,"Alright for anyone who wants to convert these songs to a useful format (mp3) Just follow these instructions:

Windows (Extract the files using Winrar or 7zip first)

1. Go here:
http://www.canudo.net/derelict/freempc/download.html
2. Click ""Click here to download FreeMPC to open a new window where FreeMPC.jar will download. (If it downloads as FreeMPC.zip just change the file extension to .jar)
3. Open FreeMPC.jar (might be a tad laggy but will load in a moment or two, works in anything 95- Windows 7)
4. In the window that opens make sure you convert to .mp3 with bitrate 192 (You can use higher but you won't notice a difference in quality)
5. Click the add button, navigate to the folder where the music was extracted to (should be 4 folders, one for each CD)
6. Open the ""Final Fantasy VII Original Sound Track (Disc 1)"" Folder and press Control+A to select all. Then press Add.
7. If you did it right then all the tracks from Disc One will appear in the list. Repeat steps 5-6 for Discs 2-4.
8. Change the destination folder for the new songs to wherever you want them to appear.
9. Click Convert the files and wait.

After they are finished, test listen to one of the songs in .mpc format. (In Winamp or a dif program, I use VLC media player). Then listen to the same song, but the 192 bitrate .mp3 version. They are the same quality, but the .mp3 version is about 70% the size of the .mpc file, plus its a useful format.

If anyone has a problem with FreeMPC, check out the FAQ on its site.

And to Osaka, please don't zip your files. If someone is going to seed they're going to seed regardless of if it means they have to copy/paste the songs to a dif folder for a day or 2 to get a good 3-4 seed ratio.

We don't care about having the extra 506 MB in our hard drive for a while, especially not when we can fit 120 gigs on an ipod and a friggen Terabyte on a tiny laptop these days.

Plus if someone isn't going to seed your stuff it really doesn't seem to make a differences as your average Seed/Leech Ratio is 8:6.3, no one is downloading any of your stuff anyways because they can find the exact same thing in an easier, useful, headache, nothing extra to install format."
,badprenup,2009-09-02T20:14Z,Headache free***
,Osaka,2009-09-09T14:07Z,"LoL n00b.

And also if these torrents weren't zipped/rared, sadly they would have been dead years ago... 

archived shit always feels annoying, but it's sometimes necessary to make certain types of torrents survive. "
,ccrocker58,2010-04-16T03:17Z,"Love how you type all this BS about how great .mpc is and how it ""sounds"" better, and how at lower quality levels it still plays better than highest quality mp3, and yada yada yada, but in the end this is all fail as fuck.

If it was so much better, why do you need to prove anything by giving these stats? If this is so much better wouldn't everyone be using it?

Sorry; a format I can use on just about any device trumps some obscure POS. This .mpc collection brings absolutely nothing to the table; I can't even use it to whack my bag to since its a soundtrack to a fucking video game.

Thank you wad11656 for providing a link to something that actually is worth a damn."
,Death214,2010-08-18T12:35Z,Or you can just get the whole thing here with 30 more seeders. http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3328647/All_Final_Fantasy_Albums .
,slackgit,2011-02-26T00:12Z,Thanks for an awesome rip. Sod all the haters out there that don't understand why you chose mpc.
,PingBear,2012-08-04T10:01Z,please seed
