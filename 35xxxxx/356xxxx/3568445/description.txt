             Ricardo Tubbs (Jamie Foxx) is urbane and dead smart. He lives 
             with Bronx-born Intel analyst Trudy (Naomie Harris), as they 
             work undercover transporting drug loads into South Florida to 
             identify a group responsible for three murders. Sonny Crockett 
             (Colin Farrell) [to the untrained eye, his presentation may seem 
             unorthodox, but procedurally, he is sound] is charismatic and 
             flirtatious until - while undercover working with the supplier of 
             the South Florida group - he gets romantically entangled with Isabella 
             (Gong Li), the Chinese-Cuban wife of an arms and drugs trafficker. 
             The best undercover identity is oneself with the volume turned up and 
             restraint unplugged. The intensity of the case pushes Crockett and         Tubbs 
             out onto the edge where identity and fabrication become blurred, where 
             cop and player become one - especially for Crockett in his romance       
with 
             Isabella and for Tubbs in the provocation of an assault on those he loves.
