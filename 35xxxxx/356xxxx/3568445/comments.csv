Thx in advance :-)"

,Midfield,2006-12-10T19:29Z,"Thank you for this movie.
But I have to say that this is a low budjet movie.

Takk for filmen, men dette må vere ein av de dårligste filmene eg har sett når det gjelder directing og filming. En skikkelig lav budsjett film. Med litt mer innsats så kunne denne filmen blitt MYE bedre."
,chuKKus,2006-12-12T18:34Z,Low bugdet? No action? This film is ART. The digital shooting is an interesting aspect of it and the story / locations are great. No words to describe Gong Li. Period.
,rikzter7674,2006-12-13T23:44Z,How come when I burn the ISO file using Nero 7 it won't play on the stand-alone DVD player? But on the computer DVD Drive it will play just fine.
,SaabPower,2006-12-15T15:12Z,Mycket bra film .. tackar

Download a program called DVDDecrypter, It is easy to use and ideal for burning image files. Its free.

You can find it here:

,DocHOL,2006-12-20T02:18Z,"rikzter7674, I'm having the same problem. On the standalone DVD player the menu won't display properly and the movie won't start from the first chapter but rather from the second. Looks like someone didn't do a perfect job of ripping this. I haven't had this kind of problem with any other movies."
,JohnyFiama,2007-01-02T22:01Z,"Ever heard of freedom of choice????? Well, this DVD upload has ZERO originality. When I download a DVD, I want the *WHOLE* DVD.. not some stripped off shit. I suggest you leave the stripping and stuff like that to the end-user so they can choose whatever they want to keep/eliminate. Personally, I want the whole thing. 
I could just have just downloaded a DivX and easily made a DVD out of it, instead of wasting my time to download a DVD that has interesting parts excluded. Fuck, I'm sick and tired of people stripping off things from DVDs.. JUST LEAVE EVERYTHING TO THE END-USER, AND LET THEM DECIDE WHAT THEY WANT TO KEEP/REMOVE, FOR FUCK'S SAKE!!!"
,jrot,2007-01-03T21:09Z,seed please
,meemar,2007-02-20T20:47Z,Det här är ju löjligt:/ Tankar i 20kb/s
,haggvik,2007-05-12T14:34Z,"A little late, but JohnyFiama, if you really want the whole DVD then go buy it instead of whining.

Extras are stripped off, so you can get better quality on the movie (this is good if you have a 42""+ plasma or LCD TV or a projector), so don't whine and go buy the movie instead."
