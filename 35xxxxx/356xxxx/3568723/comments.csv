,clintox,2006-12-05T01:55Z,"I just wanted everyone to know that this does indeed work.  If you like BF2, you'll love this game.  There is an install guide, but it's not in English and there are a few things you need to do to make this work...

1.  Mount or burn and install with a key from one of the key generators supplied.
2.  Explore the image/burnt disc and copy and paste the cracked .exe file in the ""razor1911"" folder over the one in the program files.
3.  Copy over the profile with the one given in in the ""razor1911"" zip where it makes a profile for you in your ""my documents"" folder.  Yes you need to extract it first because it is a zip file.

If you do all of this, it'll work.  Just thought I would write this because noobs wouldn't know and the install guide is not in English.  "
,clintox,2006-12-05T02:16Z,"BTW, don't download and install the patch from EA.  It will just make it not work the next time you start..."

no wory just buy it if you gona play it online .P"
,naggi69,2007-01-16T21:09Z,"Just to make things clear:

ALL games like the Battlefield series, that are ment to be played as online games, will NOT EVER EVER work in multiplayer-Online (except in very very very rare cases of screw ups with cd keys....)

If you download this you can play it online if you have bought a real legal CD-key, then you only need to reinstall with the ""legal"" CD-key, cause this is the real game, its only about the damn CD key (propably invented by satan himself)

Me myself did that with Battlefield 2, I downloaded the game, and then i got a CD key from a friend that did not feel like playing BF2 anymore, and i reinstalled it with the new CD key, and voilá game working!

You can buy CD keys propably somwhere on the net, try EA home page.

About this game; I got so in loved with the game, I just tryed the demo, and Right Away bought it!!! Trust me this is a game worth buying, cause its allways gonna be more funny to play the game as intended, with other people.

AND yes, you can play it online for free with the DEMO! Im not sure if the Demo server is still up but might be worth a try. Remember the Demo version is a lot more laggy than the real one, and BF2124 is 10times faster in loading times than BF2!

Enjoy!"

Step 3          
Unpack Default_profile.zip into %USERPROFILE%\My Documents\Battlefield 2142\.

Then open %USERPROFILE%\My Documents\Battlefield 2142\Profiles\0001\Profile.con
with a text editor and change its content to your likings.
The following fields might be of interest:

//name of the in-game user:
LocalProfile.setName ""Razor1911""

//login username:
LocalProfile.setEAOnlineMasterAccount ""Razor1911""

You might also want to have a look at the other files in this dir!

Step 4          
Start the game, when prompted by the login prompt, enter whatever you used for
LocalProfile.setEAOnlineMasterAccount. If you didn't change anything in
Profile.con this will be ""Razor1911"". You will be prompted by a box telling
you are playing in offline mode, press 'OK'. Now select your profile and the game
will start!     


P.S. If you want to play on any official servers, buy the game!"

Follow this: 
1. Unzip the zip file to a folder where you want to put the INSTALLATION files.

2. In the INSTALLATION folder you can install the game with the setup icon.

3. Use the keygen in the INSTALLATION folder: Razor1911 folder: keygen icon.

4. Choose a GAME folder for the install.

5. Install.

6. Search for the zip file (default_Profile) in the Razor1911 folder in INSTALLATION folder, and unzip it to C:/ [YOUR WINDOWS PROFILE]'S DOCUMENTS: Battlefield 2142 folder!

7. Copy and Paste the BF2142 crack file from the Razor1911 folder to the GAME folder.

8.When you start the game you should see a profile name Razor1911 on the start screen. Write the Password: ""Razor1911"".

9. Now you can play, but only in Offline Mode, so you cant unlock the items.

I hope I could help you play!:D"

,Gaon94,2011-06-05T09:46Z,"After reading some comments from people who wanted to guide,i'll try to make it as clear to understand as possible.

1.Unzip the file to where you want to place the installation files.(I choose the My Received Files folder inside the documents folder,reason being the unzipped file's folder is called Battlefield 2142,also there will be another folder in the documents called Battlefield 2142,which weirdly,holds the profile for the game.So obviously if you unzip the file into documents,then there will be two folders with same name and that's not good.

2.Use any mounting device(Example.Daemon Tools.) and mount the zip file called (rzr-2142) inside the Battlefield 2142 folder inside My Received Files.There are also two more things inside (A text Document called Install Readme that's not in english and a Multi keygen."

,Gaon94,2011-06-05T09:55Z,"
3.After mounting setup starts,i don't remember whether it asks for your cd-key during the start of install or the end,either way,there are two key generators,one in the Battlefield 2142 folder,other is in the (rzr-2142) zip file.I remember a comment saying to use the one that's inside the (rzr-2142) zip file instead not sure why,but anyway inside there's a folder called Razor1911,of course it's easier to open the same thing by clicking on the icon (2142 BATTLEFIELD) in the mounting device(I'm not sure if other mounting tools has that same picture there but anyway)if you have sidebar at your desktop."
,Gaon94,2011-06-05T09:56Z,"If not,i don't know about other ones,but if your using daemon tools,open it from your taskbar,right click on whichever Drive you mounted on and click on ""Open in File Explorer"",the same installation folder will open as when you open the (rzr-2142) zip file.There you will see a folder called Razor 1911,inside you will see three things,""BF2142"" , ""default_Profile"" and Keygen,we need all three but for now just (Keygen).At the point of time it asks you for your cd-key,turn on the Keygen(your antivirus might say it's trojan but i used it and it seems fine,or i wouldn't be here now).If the randomly generated key goes into the setup bar asking for your key,then you can proceed if not just type it.By the way do not close the Razor1911 folder just yet,we need the other two items inside as well.
"
,Gaon94,2011-06-05T09:56Z,"
4.Right click on (default_Profile) inside the Razor1911 folder and unzip all of it to the folder called Battlefield 2142 inside the Documents for me it started at desktop when i unzip,then i went [C:>>Users>>(My window profile's name)>>Documents>>Battlefield 2142(Note:NOT the folder in the My Received Files,there's another exact same named folder in the Documents,which i was talking about at first.The folder is originally blank profile,but if you unzip (default_Profile) there,you get a free profile without needing to create one.
"
,Gaon94,2011-06-05T09:59Z,"

5.The last item in the Razor1911 folder,called BF2142,some might notice there's an exactly same one in the Game folder that was installed,at C:>>Program Files>>Electronic Arts>>Battlefield 2142,that one inside is the real one but it doesn't work(Not cracked),the one in the Razor1911 folder is the crack,so just simply copy the Cracked one from the Razor1911 folder to the Game folder and when it asks to replace,agree on it.Of course if you guys somehow(Can't think of one) want to keep the uncracked BF2142.exe then rename it and be creative(make a new folder somewhere outside and put it in?),not sure if it will affect the game if you leave it in the same spot after renaming.
"
,Gaon94,2011-06-05T10:00Z,"

6.Simple part,after starting the game from then on,your username everytime you enter the login screen,will always be Razor1911(Yes without typing anything)then,all you need to do is type the password,which is the same as the username,so everytime u start the game just type Razor1911 in the password,then enter and don't patch because it breaks the game,Type your nickname,choose Razor1911 as your soldier and you can enter.
"
,Gaon94,2011-06-05T10:01Z,"
By the way for people who's still not clear on most of these crack things,mostly just watch out for,the downloaded game folder,the installation folder and the folder where you unzipped the torrent you downloaded.Most crack,keygen and any other extra stuff usually are placed at folders where it shouldn't be there,for Example,when you buy a game dvd-rom and went home to download it,there shouldn't be weird folders like ""Razor1911"" or ""Cracks"" when the file opens,meaning whenever you finish a torrent download and open the files,anything out of the ordinary among the normal setup files inside,are the ones you need to make the game work after installing it.I don't know all cracks like the back of my hand but after you install the game,most or all of the applications that initiates(starts) a game(Example BF2142.exe) doesn't work because it's not cracked,that's why most torrents have crack inside somewhere because if they don't then you can't play,that means the torrent is pointless to download."
,Gaon94,2011-06-05T10:03Z,"
That's right,so if you choosed to make a shortcut during installation,it's for the uncracked exe application,so the shortcut doesn't work either.After you replace the cracked BF2142.exe with the uncracked one,delete the old shortcut made during installation and create a new one inside the game folder,you can also name it back to what it was,without the word ""Shortcut"" inside the name.Then put it back out at the desktop and a working shortcut is there.Most people should know how to do that easily. 

I guess this is it,i've hoped that trying to be clear isn't too long or a bother to read,because instructions do get confusing,so clear but long is the best way to go. And yes,i've not posted before,so i was slightly confused as to why the Submit button didn't work,just ignore the first and second step duplicate and read this all.Also i hoped to have helped as many as possible. :D"
,orion97,2011-06-11T12:29Z,its running in multiplayer
,.saxxon,2011-08-03T09:52Z,How did you get multiplayer running Orion97?
,.saxxon,2011-08-03T09:59Z,"These will be simple, straight forward instructions. 
You need an iso mounter (search for dameon tools lite and download it) and you also need WinRar (search WinRar and download it)

Now you can get started. 
Open the folder after you download the torrent.
Use Dameon tools to mount rzr-2142
after it mounts, run it. 
Install the game.
When it asks for a code, go back into the folder that has rzr2142 and use the multikeygen.
Enter the code and you will be able to install.

You are not done here."
,.saxxon,2011-08-03T10:09Z,"You need to move the BF2142 icon that is in the torrented folder to the ""real"" game folder and replace it. This will let you play without a CD

Go into your C drive. Go into your program files
go into Electronic arts. then battlefield 2142.
Then you will see the ""real"" game icon. Move the icon from the torrent folder into the ""real"" game folder and now you can run the game without the CD.

But now you have no profile and you can not make one with your cheapskate pirated copy so you have to do some work.

Remember when you extracted the rzr2142?
Go back to all the crap you extracted from it. There will be a folder named razor1911.
In that folder there is a folder named profiles.
copy the 4 files from that profiles folder.

now venture over to your documents. You will be alarmed to find you have a new folder that you didn't put there. It is named Battlefield 2142. Go into it and then move into this other profile folder you now see. 
Once inside, Paste the 4 files from the razor1911 profiles folder into this ""real"" profiles folder.

Now start the game back up.
Username Razor1911. Pass Razor1911

It will lead you to play in offline mode, that is as good as it gets. I have not figured out how to play multi with this.
"
,.saxxon,2011-08-03T10:14Z,"******IMPORTANT******
There was an error. After installing the game,
