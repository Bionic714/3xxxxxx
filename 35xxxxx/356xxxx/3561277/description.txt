the details:
unfortunately the tape i'm working from was not labelled, but based on memories and maarten's indispensable tour history, i'm pretty sure the show was 6/16/00. it was filmed at fletcher's in baltimore, and it's chris solo. for those of you who have seen the rosebud DVD: in my opinion, this one is not quite as good, video-wise, but it's a great show musically. check this link for screenshots:
