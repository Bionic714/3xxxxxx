,telebender,2006-12-04T00:32Z,"Grrrrrrrrrreat
I've been waitin' fo this

tnx"
,lutefisq,2006-12-04T03:36Z,I think there's a file missing from this torrent.  There should be a .bin file to go along with the .cue file.
,lutefisq,2006-12-04T03:41Z,"...for the record, I'm not postive about my comment, but I was unable to get the .cue file to mount using MagicISO.

If someone was able to get this mounted, please post."
,dmale,2006-12-04T13:24Z,It's mountable with Daemon Tools. But where's the keygen????
,lutefisq,2006-12-04T17:57Z,keygen: http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3570512
,sten_n,2007-01-24T18:09Z,"Thank you ;-)
Now the (B4 II) works very well."
,newcoats,2007-02-03T23:57Z,can anybody give me the code
,trackdaddy,2007-03-06T04:02Z,need keygen
,cyclopian,2007-09-04T17:51Z,Couldn't find the H2O crack on this!
,ForminaSage,2008-01-10T03:02Z,"Nice find. Too bad there isn't a keygen with it, hopefully the link lutefisq provided will get seeded."
,mrgreenjeans9,2008-01-25T19:31Z,"anyone know how to 'copy' the system ID from the install screen?  i can see the text, i just can't copy it for the keygen.  arrrgh"
,artytorrent,2008-02-22T18:39Z,"Off topic comment for ChipXd:
You asked me for a working keygen for Addictive Drums 1.1 update.
I don't have a keygen, but if you don't mind getting your hands dirty with a little bit of HEX editing, then the following should sort out the issue:

1. Install the v1.1 update.
2. Installer makes a new 'Resources.xpak' in the AD library folder.
3. Rather than overwrite it completely with the one made by the v1.0 kg, open 'Resources.xpak' with HexEdit (or similar free program).
5. Also open 'Resources.xpak' made by kg.
6. Compare the 16 bytes of info from addresses BF015 to BF024.
7. Copy the 16 bytes from the update version into the keygen version and save the file.
8. Use this new version of Resources.pak when generating a serial number. I'm told it works.

I'll be testing this on a PC later today. Hopefully it also works on Macs."
,LaGuitarraMuerta,2008-05-14T09:41Z,"sorry to bother y'all...
i don't get it. i have burned this in a CD, and a DVD
both the .bin and .cue files...

thx in advance"
,NURIYEPOCORNI,2008-05-27T17:38Z,does anyone know if there is an h20 for nuendo 4 yet seed plzzz 
,alanevil,2008-10-08T22:33Z,There is no keygen.  The keygen linked by lutefisk contains a virus.
,vixen-of-alcatraz,2008-10-12T18:55Z,"Yes, do not download the keygen as it is a trojan. It has already infected my testbed pc which now needs cleaning."
,vixen-of-alcatraz,2008-10-12T18:57Z,"By the way, the keygen did work, and did generate a correct serial, which made the B4II work perfectly. Generate yourself a serial from it on a PC which you don't give a shit about, then type the serial in. It should work then."
,meowser,2008-11-12T15:29Z,"This seems to work:

23857-85593-17103-01994-11915

But how to get around registration I dont know. Anyone?"
,meowser,2008-11-12T15:43Z,"http://chuckhohosuck.nm.ru/b4ii2_kg.zip

'nother keygen"
,fragie,2009-01-06T11:27Z,"The keygen from
http://chuckhohosuck.nm.ru/b4ii2_kg.zip
has the same trojan in it.

Anyone who has found a working one without trojan?"
,Sly.Won,2009-07-27T06:40Z,"@artytorrent. does it work for macs?

thanks"
,Malchik,2009-09-28T03:40Z,"23857-85593-17103-01994-11915 work great!

But how can I get passed registration?"
,gyaradon,2009-12-23T07:32Z,You know that keygen in the other torrent? It's the real keygen. It's not a virus. Use it.
,JohnRick,2009-12-31T14:50Z,"This B4 is excellent. I have however not yet used the keygen, since I have my second shitty laptop for taking care of all possible keygens.
It works for everything except when it's NI-stuff, where the authorization code is ""copied to clipboard"". Where the hell can I read or open this clipboard? I may be completely wack, but nonetheless. The option is to use the keygen directly on my primary laptop and there use ""paste from clipboard"" which I will not.
So - any suggestions?"
,itzamoovee,2010-01-27T16:58Z,downloaded keygen from above link- avast did say runtime packed fsg or wutever but i pressed ignore- then i installed b4 and it asked for a serial which I got from the keygen...then it said i needed to register so i ran the registration tool from the installation...then it gave me a hardware id which i pasted to the keygen and clicked generate which it did and i went back to the registration tool and pressed paste and that's it...very simple
,Musicman5150,2010-02-22T22:06Z,For some reason i cant get the keygen.exe to run.  everytime i download it it ends up in my incomplete folder.  I run it anyways but the only thing that happens is that a black box comes up but disappears in less than a second.
,narutoxela,2010-04-17T04:16Z,"hey i just uploaded this one and you dont need a keygen just install and you are ready to go:

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5499949/Native.Instruments.B4.II.VSTi.DXi.RTAS.v2.0.4-AMPLiFY

hope it helps.  (i didint make this. Team AMPLiFY did)"
,Catatonicat,2010-07-20T03:32Z,"I'm a Mac user and surely enough I've installed and used the key posted in the comments, but then it sent me to the registration tool. Since there was no other info about registration and authentication for Mac users I just have to inquire about it here. It also seems like Pro Logic 9 doesn't find it when I try to use B4 with it. Any solutions?"
,iguana88,2011-06-07T11:20Z,Hey Guuy.... Plese tell me... do you found a way get passed the registration? I'm allready the third if  not fourth or so person who needs this so please.. du you know a way to get past tha registration?
