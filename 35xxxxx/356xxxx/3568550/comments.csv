After extracting the files I got ""setup.001-007"".
Please, what do I do?"
,HotTamale24,2006-12-18T20:15Z,"Uhm, what do we do with the files in here? I see no way to install them..."

,Songkiat,2007-01-04T01:20Z,"Solution Install
Extract all zips to the same folder, then use WinRAR to extract the setup.001 file. You have to manually open the setup.001 in winrar, as winrar wont recognise it automatically. "
,thegr8ashish,2007-01-04T21:41Z,where is setup.002 file winrar need that to extract whole file without setup.002 file this is a waste to download
