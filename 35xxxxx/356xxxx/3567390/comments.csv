,kee23,2006-12-09T20:59Z,can anyone tell me who downloaded this that if it works and if u can install it in english language thx
,vietti,2007-01-01T19:20Z,havent got the program yet but i would think you use magic ISO to convert the BIN files into an ISO  (tools/convert bin to iso) take the new iso and burn to a cd  (tools/burn iso to cd/dvd)
,MUSHROOM_BOY,2007-01-31T21:15Z,"i think it is the CUE file that gives wrong adress to the BIN file.

you can control this by (NOTE: keep the BIN and CUE file in the same folder.) open the CUE file in notepad and if the adrees line goes C:\document and settings\user\my folder\aa-aacad2007plb.bin or somthing like this, you only haweto delete the path. the bin file is in the same folder as the CUE file so you hawe to tell it that it is the aa-aacad2007plb.bin file it whants.

i dont know if this is the problem but some times in the past when BIN and CUE wore in use i only altered the file atribute from BIN to ISO some times it workt and some times it woldent work.

good lock."
