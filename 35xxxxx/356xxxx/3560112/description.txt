Synopsis
An ex-detective lives retired, under the false name of Jeff Bailey, in a small town running a petrol station, in love with fishing and a young woman whom he wants to marry. Nevertheless, an old acquaintance goes to his place announcing him that his boss wants to see him. Bailey is forced to tell his fianc√©e his cloudy past: hired by a gangster, Whit Sterling, to look for his lover, Catie Moffett, escaped with a substantial sum of money, Bailey found her in Acapulco and fell in love with her; both went away to live to San Francisco, but after giving death to an old Baileys mate who had discovered them, she escaped again. Bailey will now find her again in arms of Sterling and will have the reasonable suspicion that, feeling betrayed, he will want to take revenge.
