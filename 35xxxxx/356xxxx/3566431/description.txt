In the spring of 2000 while in miami beach, fl; eddie vedder spent a drunken
night in the studio of sean "birdman" gould.  
With a few random musicians, they all recorded off-the-wall covers. this
session was dubbed "the birdman sessions", and copies of the recordings
were made for all of the participants.
Copies of these tapes eventually leaked out amongst the pearl jam trading
elite, and it stayed amongst those elite for quite a while.
About a week later, a post appeared on pearl jam's official message board,
apparently directly from the band, asking that all of the songs be removed
from the site, the video mission (tvm).
They hadn't given permission for these songs to be transmitted, and were
upset that they were being made public.
Within a few hours, it was official - the cease-and-desist sent to tvm about
these sessions came directly from the band's lawyers.
