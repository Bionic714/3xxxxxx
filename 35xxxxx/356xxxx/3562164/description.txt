The Cycle Sluts From Hell were an American heavy rock band from the early 1990s. They were only together briefly but are remembered for their name, which is among the funniest in rock music.

The band comprised four women singing under stage names Queen Vixen, Venus Penis Crusher, She-Fire of Ice, and Honey 1%-er, with a backing band of session players.

The band's self-titled debut album was their only release. The song "I Wish You Were a Beer" is their best known track; the video clip for it got MTV airplay when released and still appears regularly around the world (eg. Australia). The track featured in the MTV show Beavis and Butthead too.

Included here are the above mentioned album in MP3 format (128 kbps). Enjoy!
