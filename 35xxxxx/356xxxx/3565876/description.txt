The 1984/5 BBC series The Tripods was one of the longest adaptations on British television -- as long as War and Peace (1972/3), and with 120 speaking parts. It was the BBC's most ambitious and controversial venture into "telefantasy", with the verdicts of the critics ranging all the way from a minor masterpiece to a dreadful folly. It overreached itself and the projected third season was cancelled, but the first two books of John Christopher's celebrated trilogy were completely dramatised, and there's much to value: fine scripting, lavish costume and design, ground-breaking model work and video editing, beautifully composed landscape filming, good acting and painstaking care over details.
