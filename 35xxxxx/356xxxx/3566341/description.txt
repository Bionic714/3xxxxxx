Throwing Muses 4 Albums (4AD)

Based in Boston, Massachusetts, Throwing Muses were the first American act to sign to 4AD, pioneering a singular form of *alternative rock* years before the term existed. The band was formed in 1983 by step-sisters Kristin Hersh (vocals/guitar) and Tanya Donelly (guitar/vocals), who were both at high school at the time. Initially called Kristin Hersh And The Muses, the line-up was completed by bassist Elaine Adamedes and drummer Becca Blumen, who eventually gave way to Leslie Langston and David Narcizo respectively.
