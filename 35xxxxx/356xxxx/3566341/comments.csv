,Franoz,2008-11-02T19:50Z,"Hello Kefissos, first of all thanks a lot for all your work. I managed to recover some classics thanks to your 4AD uploads, keep the good work. I am looking for torrents of a french new wave band that had some success outside france in the early 80, KAS PRODUCT.  You could say they were at the forefront of EBM, would you have this in your archives?"
[V],Kefissos,2008-11-25T01:24Z,"Franoz, I'm sorry I can't help you right now,
but I'll ask for it on some special music-stores in my city."
