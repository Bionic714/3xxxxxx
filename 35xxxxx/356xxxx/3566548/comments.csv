,RexMundi,2006-11-29T11:22Z,Why is the movie pink? Is it some kind of anti-CAM thing?
,Jacky_D,2006-12-01T01:05Z,"this ain´t no Xvid.... it´s just a crappy CAM shhit... and I mean really crappy, the cam is plased from the side and one guy is blocking like 1/# of the screen!!!! dont download and for god´s sake don´t fucking seed! I´ll never use to complain about the quallity of films butt this is royale-shit"
,hatasimmning,2006-12-01T16:43Z,"i think it's a reeeeeally good telesync. good sync and very good pic.. little anoying that someone is covering 1/10 of the picture..

[V],olingskoG,2006-12-02T10:57Z,"NO shit, this anit XviD Jacky_D? Are you sure? Haha "
,behaman,2006-12-02T20:09Z,"Haha,thanks Jacky_D for good description.So,it's ok anyways when people honestly say about quality.Thanks uploaders too for trying to share free stuff with us,but sometimes we just have to make choice,take it or leave it.We have some uploaders who's movies are A+,no doubt.New guys shouldn't post movies in real poor quality,i mean no offense,but it's wasting time and HD space.
Thank you guys and keep this community alive."

,alf_palf,2006-12-09T21:20Z,Swe sub ?
,SoundWall,2006-12-19T11:30Z,"Jacky_D,
Do you even know what XVid is? It has NOTHING to do with the quality. It's a compression-format you stupid s-o-b.

Also, it says clearly in the title ""TELESYNC"". So if you're expecting a dvd-rip then you're just plain retarded.

TS is better than CAM but it's still alot worse than a DVD-rip."

,agthecool,2007-01-09T19:51Z,Seedaa please
,pmsbull,2007-01-11T17:04Z,"DEFINATELY WORTH A LOOOK. Exttreme bottom left of screen is blacked out by a head for first few mins but goes away. Cam is shot from side but very quickly adjusted to compensate. Sound ok vision definately watchable.
MY ADVICE : good film, watch it. If it's one you really want, wait for a divx."
