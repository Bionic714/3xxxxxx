The subtitles conform to divx standard, so you don't have to watch them if you don't want them."
,shoeshoe,2006-12-01T09:46Z,"Thanks DogNo7!

P.S. is this standalone safe? No Qpel, No GMC?"
,DogNo7,2006-12-01T22:01Z,"I encoded it using the divx encoder 6.21.  I included the three audio tracks with 1st pref to 5.1 audio, 2nd to Stereo, 3rd director's commentary.

The subtitles are not forced onto the main video stream, so it should work pretty normally.

With the current seeders, download time is short."
,DogNo7,2006-12-01T22:03Z,"Oh yeah, this is an original rip I did from an original dvd.
"
,DogNo7,2006-12-01T22:06Z,"The divx encoder defaults were used so no qpel.  Dunno what gmc is, though."

,DogNo7,2006-12-03T01:54Z,"I don't read every faq on the planet.  If I cared, or it mattered to me, I would.  Since I don't, I'm not going to.  Why don't you just post the answer if you know it?  Or are you too leet?

He seems to have spent the last fifteen years just chilling out. I miss Carpenter and while we're at it, Joe Dante too"
,battlebot147,2008-05-20T12:46Z,so erm commentery over the origanal audio any help???
,Panzerfaust1974,2008-06-23T21:54Z,"thanks a lot for this one, dude... it's a very good horror movie, i guess. i have seen it and i may say this. thx !"
,DogNo7,2008-10-19T06:40Z,"As it states in the comments I put in the torrent description...

STEREO, 5.1, Director's commentary Audio tracks.
English subtitles available.

As with most of my divx torrents, this used the encoder from divx.com, and has multiple audio tracks, so you can select what you want to listen to.

Most players will automatically play the main (original) audio track with no issues.  For the few that don't, use your remote or menu options to select the other audio track.

""Help!  I'm surrounded by people that are using computers and have no idea what they are doing, or how to click on a menu!""
