,Dempo,2008-02-17T12:58Z,"man, u guys must be pretty f*cking stupid...  every f*cking thing have to be served on a plate...
if u use your brains only a tad over what u usually use when u open up a bottle of jam, u could have figured out that the only thing that had to be done was click the ""1"" (files) to bring out a list of the filenames... in this case it was only one file... easier for u retards to comprehend then maybe..."
,hostenavarin,2008-02-28T20:34Z,"So, people should have to click on every single torrent, then click on every single file list, in order to find something they want?  Yes, that's far more convenient than simply reading it off of the search results."

,AudioDYO,2008-04-05T20:45Z,"Lol Dempo, you've just made yourself look such a tit. 10 days after someone tells YOU what to do you decide to pretend you never read that post and come across like you're the only guy in the world who fuckin knows what to do?? What a prick, just for you then I think everything should be called 'torrent', if you wnat to know what it is then you know what to do don't you? Fuckin retard, totally missed the point, what a dumb arse you are, lol. "
