ATTiCUS ACTiViST TOOLKiT - AN iNCONVENiENT TRUTH SPECiAL EDiTiON

Greetings.

All Good Activists, I suppose should be using the tools provided by the GNU/Linux Free Software Movement, as spearheaded by Saint iGNUcius, Richard M. Stallman.

However if tools are good enough for Business, then they are good enough for Activists, and for some jobs that need to get done, they may have to get down and dirty with the Microsoft world.

Hence the tools indirectly, yet kindly, provided by the rebel "Dark Side", the Freed Software Movement.

Here is a modest DiY Toolkit for Activists, that is available on that global communal hard-drive, reliably accessible by dialup modem to the four corners of the world, known as the ed2k (eDonkey, eMule) P2P peer-to-peer file-sharing network.

Please note that RELEASES.LST is the main resource listing of the Software Tools and Activist Media.

The RELEASES.LST displays best with GetDiZ, using the Lucida Console 10pt font, the other files, such as NFO and DiZ display better with the venerable DAMN NFO Viewer.

This is the Activist DiY Toolkit - An Inconvenient Truth - Special Edition. 

Credit and Kudos to many, many people, thankyou all.

Please feel free to pass on these links to those whom you think might find them of use.

Please do not include origination addresses when forwarding, thankyou.

Share and Enjoy.

Best Regards.

ATTiCUS

Maycomb, Alabama.
