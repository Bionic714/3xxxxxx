,_Morphine,2008-02-18T02:16Z,"Guys just so there's no problems,
AlienGUIse
LogonStudio
and Bootskin
are all available from the Stardock website (www.stardock.com) and the Alienware website (www.alienware.com)
The only program you need a crack/keygen/subscription for is WindowBlinds, of which the newest version (WindowBlinds6) is now available. WindowBlinds is also available as a demo for, I believe, 30 days. If you are really into the skinning/desktop customization scene, I would highly recommend buying ObjectDesktop. It is a 1 year subscription (which means you get updates for 1 year). It does cost $49.95, but it is well worth it.

Just my 2 cents."
