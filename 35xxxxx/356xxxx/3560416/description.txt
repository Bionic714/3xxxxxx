The maker of Ghostbusters and Road Trip gives you a hilarious look at life on Earth and joins forces with the biggest stars in the universe. David Duchovny (The X-Files), Orland Jones (The Replacements), Seann William Scott (American Pie) and Academy Award -nominee Julianne Moore (Hannibal) make a discovery of alien lifeforms that could change the world.
