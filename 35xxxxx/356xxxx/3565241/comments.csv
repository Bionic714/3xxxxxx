Plus, I started my timer 1 minute before to get the 5-15 seconds that was missing in many S01, S02 episodes. Most of the time, it was not needed but it is better to get them when I can. :D"
,killerwabbit1,2006-11-26T17:06Z,I'm having problems downloading episodes S02E07 Could someone possibly reseed that one please I'm  downloading 24/7 so any time would be great i'm stuck at 81.9%.  I LOVE FIRST WAVE and really appreciate all your work!!
,x7nifr,2006-11-26T21:53Z,"hei friends,

is there any chance to get the rest of the show, what do you think?"
,i2mfan,2006-11-26T22:02Z,"Be more specific, please.

I have to wait to record each episodes. So yes, you will have all S03.

Or are you talking about a specific episode that need seeding because you are stuck? Just say which one and I'm sure someone will help you.
