I did, however, notice that when I tried to convert it to mkv, that I had to do some things in mkvtoolnix that I normally don't have to do. But I'm not complaining. I'm just trying to help others. If you're curious, I uploaded my first torrent as the result of this conversion. I hope I explained myself properly there in that upload."
