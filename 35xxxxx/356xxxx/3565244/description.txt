The World Uncovered - Will Israel Bomb Iran?

Just as Israel ends one war, is it getting ready for what may be its next armed conflict? This time, the enemy is Iran, accused of arming Hezbollah's militia and planning to develop nuclear weapons. 

This film reveals Israel's view of the threat and gets inside the intensely secret world of the Israeli military, which speaks openly for the first time about what they see as the "existential" threat to Israel, posed by Iran's alleged atomic weapons programme.
