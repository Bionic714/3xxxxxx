,steilno,2006-11-26T20:03Z,Seems the best solution would be they nuke each other. only way the fight will ever end
,tomtomx,2006-11-26T21:55Z,"""and the only way to defend themselves would be to kill all arabs""

Funny, I saw the same program and never heard anything even close to that. Guess you fell asleep and had a wet dream...."

,gregersamsa,2006-11-27T04:20Z,"I'd rather get rid of all the arabs than all the jews. I mean seriously, I understand that they'd want to defend their country. But I've never heard of any israelis blowing themselves up at a Starbuck along with children and other civilians just to make some strange point about being with 98 virgins in the afterlife... Seems arabs are just looking for a fight in all parts of the world.
World Trade Center, Pentagon, Indonesia, Malaysia, London, Madrid, Copenhagen... Basically anywhere where'd they were welcomed to live new lives... This is how they show their gratitude? Nice..."
,Osaka,2006-11-27T08:14Z,"World Trade Center and the Pentagon was a self inflicted wound, as well as the 7/7 bombings in London. Wake up.

(by the way, a Boeing 757 does cannot vanish into thin air.. think about that)"
,dobardan,2006-11-29T07:33Z,"If Iran develops nuklearweapons and/or Israel bombs Iran, things could very well develop to something of a third world war scenario!! The best thing would be if the people of Iran got rid of the regim in Teheran, because thats the biggest problem in this mess!! I personally know some people from Iran and they all say the same thing, that some 75 - 90% of the people in Iran doesnÂ´t have any problems with the Israelis or the Americans!! The problem lies within the Iranian regim and it canÂ´t be fixed with Israeli bombs!! "
,daDuude,2006-11-29T20:34Z,"""and the only way to defend themselves would be to kill all arabs""

Hey Sherlock, Iranians are not arabs..and bombing (no nukes) iranian nuclear facilities won't kill the iranian people either."
,MaxXximilian,2006-12-03T17:27Z,"BULLSHIT documentary. I just finished watching it. I'm surprised that BBC would make such shitty & non-objective load of crap. 

We got about 20 Israeli army officers, former presidents etc. talking about bombing Iranian targets just in case.... 
Based on 1 statement made by the Iranian president and plane suspicion. No HARD EVIDENCE (this sounds familiar)

And only one guy or so from the Iranian side get to speak.

The Americans = Israeli, will find just as much Nuke bombs in Iran as they did in Irak, None.

Iran has the right to produce energy. 
And even if they had the technology or even bombs:
It's the funniest thing that it is 2 countries that have themselves admitted having Nuke bombs that are going after the rest of the world and telling everyone to disarm.

Now, I'm not saying the Iranian regime is good. Iran still got many issues to deal with within the country, civil rights etc. 

Do a little research by yourself. Don't always believe the mainstream media networks, often there are big interests behind what they feed people with. 

Don't even believe me god dammit, do some research before you make up your mind.


Last but not least.
Iranians are not Arabs you stupid, ignorant idiots."
,tomtomx,2006-12-04T23:33Z,"Yeah, the iranians desperately need nuclear power to make them less dependant on oil producing countries... "
,dobardan,2006-12-08T04:23Z,"Well, there is only one problem regarding the last statement in this matter; Iran is the second biggest oil producer in the world after Saudiarabia, according to OPEC!!"
,MariaE71,2007-01-16T13:04Z,"""The best thing would be if the people of Iran got rid of the regim in Teheran, because thats the biggest problem in this mess!!""

No! The only problem in this mess is the very regrettable existence of the state-terroristic, bloodthirsty, apartheid fake state israel. The recongition of the non natural, state terroristic, blodthirsty, apartheid, zionist fake-state israel is the worlds biggest post WWII misstake."
,MariaE71,2007-01-16T13:13Z,"By the way, far from all jews are bloodthirsty zionist bastards, and many non-jews are bloodthirsty zionist scums. Zionism are the single biggest cause of antisemitism today. If we want to end antisemitism, we must end the zionists butchering of the Palestinian and Lebanese people.

If one dislikes deaths, state-terror, murders, bloodbaths, illegal occupations, apartheid and so on, one automaticly therefor, whether he/she knows it or not, dislike the people that commits these wrongdoings, the zionists that is.

israel does not deserve to exist.
israel must sease to exist."
[V],SweBullDoG,2007-02-01T16:24Z,"to keep the people from revolution iran get an enemy outside the country to blame.. in this case Israel is the black sheep.. dont you antisemits learn anything in school? this is exactly what bismark did to keep the country together.. Israel killed maybe 3000 people/terrorists last year, I wounder how many women who got killed by their husbands in the arab world to keep the ""honor"", sometimes i just dont know if im going to cry or laugh, ""honor"", are they really serious?"
,tomtomx,2007-03-12T18:49Z,"Maria: What a load of bullshit. Have you ever considered the environment Israel is facing? What kind of neighbours it has? Israel has been under a constant threath since before it was founded. By countries who's borders are no more (or less) legit than israels. Even under that circumstance israel has succeded in building a working democracy in a part of the world where dictators compete with religous fanatics on who can force the most cruel and medevial values on tha locals. Locals who have the lowest eductional level of the world. (And probably the lowest level of civil rights in the world.) The only cpuntry in the region where arabs have full democratic rights is... israel!
The number of terrorists (or whatever you like to call them) that has been killed by the israelis is a tiny fraction compared to those killed within the neighbour countries.
But I guess that you gladly blame israel for all the tens of thousands sunnis killed by shias and vice versa in all countries all over the world? (The first suicide bombers where for instance used in the war between iran and irak decades ago.... )"
,tomtomx,2007-03-12T18:54Z,Israel has it's lunatic religiuos fanatics just as all other countries in the region. The difference is that in israel they're in a minority and not in power. Israel is under constant attack. Compare it's action with the actions of for instance US or UK after one single little muslim terrorist attack each! 
,doudave,2007-04-30T23:56Z,"Hey Maria, do us all a favor and go blow yourself up.  Makesure your future terrorists, i mean your current children are next to you when you do it.  This way maybe your family blood line can be stopped."
