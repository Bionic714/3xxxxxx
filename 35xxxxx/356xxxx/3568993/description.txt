I\'ll be re-seeding the whole series where needed as last year\'s \"up\" is still going for certain episodes .

Please , if you can , seed as much as possible as it\'s a damn fine series , don\'t ya know .

The quality is variable as the various files came from different sources , but it is more than watchable and very enjoyable if you like historical drama .

Please see http://thepiratebay.org/user/wankan for the other episodes if you are new to \"Sharpe\" .

Enjoy .
