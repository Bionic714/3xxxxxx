Plot Outline: An examination of occultism as practiced in different parts of the world.

Author: lthseldy1 from Norfolk, VA

This is a good video for those that may or may not be somewhat interested in the occult. It touches up on several occultic religious such as Wiccan and Satanism and dismisses religious bias that the Christian church has thrown at the practice of the occult for so many centuries. I recognized a few of those that were interviewed such as Micheal Aquino and Anton Levay as guests put on such talk shows like Geraldo Ravera and Sally Jassy Raphael and remembered all the boo's that they received even before they began to explain themselves and their religion. If you watch this documentary with an open mind and remove the blinders that most of society has dished out, you may find that most occult religions are just.....misunderstood.
