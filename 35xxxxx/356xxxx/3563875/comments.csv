Wow. I know that Muslim scholars claim that the Bible, Torah & all have been systematically corrupted to remove all references to Muhammad, Mecca, Allah etc. - a position contradicted by all historical evidence we have.

Still, the amount of twisting that Islam needs to do in order to make the Bible predict Muhammad is amazing. Look at the amount of words needed to change the story from its original intent and purpose!

Actually, I find it telling that Islam needs to do stuff like this to legitimize Muhammad. Islamic scholars must be seriously worried about the quality of their existing evidence when they need to do this."

Islam is the most stupid of all religions, simply because they refuse to accept how stupid they are.. while all of the other religions already did by questioning the scriptures that were written by MAN in a totally different cultural context...

And no Bullshit, the quran was written by man, the prophet simpley spoke out loud and other ppl listened..THERE WAS LITLE DIRECT WRITTINGS.. 
and the quran was actually compiled after the death of the prophet (THEY DARED TO DO SOMETHING THE PROPHET HIMSELF DIDN'T?), BY otman, which recovered all availeble texts from soldeirs, simpley because a lot of the soldiers that knew the quran had died at the battle of Yamama.
so he gathered scriptures written in leafs, planks, whatever, probably even some in toilet paper... And as if this isn't enough to warp the ""inalterable direct word of god"", many scriptures were retrieved from men that had memorized and made up their own interpretation of the texts, about 20 years after the death of muhammed.. remenber that 20 years in those days was half a life time, since 40 years old was probably an old man...
THEN HE (OTMAN) COMPILED the texts, by CHOOSING which one's HE would LIKE to include or exclude from the QURAN and hadith..
the muhamed dude died around 632 while the scriptures were INVENTED BY MEN around 656...
THEREFORE being a muslin is stupid! unless you serioulsy question all of your teachings, and don't regard them as the direct word of gOD but instead the direct word of Man!"

Arrogance is incurable, because arrogance lives behind the tinted blinders of Ignorance and denies itself. But quite often Ignorance is bliss, my blissful friends! So I think I'll have another beer ? and drink to Religion, the politics of scoundrels; those who twist it to suit their fancy. And we pay the profit mongers with our obeisance, servitude, possessions, blood, lives. Peace."

As Groucho Marx commented: Everybody needs to believe in something. I believe, I'll have another beer."
