,raven_dwe,2007-03-05T07:05Z,Spoken language should be ether Cantonese or Mandarin
,SimultaniousDeaths,2007-11-05T00:34Z,Finally a copy with the original language spoken and not the silly ENGDUBed one. Excellent quality as well and works great with this eng-sub: http://www.opensubtitles.org/en/subtitles/241802/kung-fu-en
,Alecssei,2009-01-05T22:54Z,"I just downloaded this but it's really only Japanese (or whatever Asian language it may be, I can't tell). there are unfortunately no subtitles, BUT the quality is very good!!!"
,SoyJoy,2009-04-10T03:42Z,"The spoken language can't be Japanese.
It's should either Cantonese or Mandarin."
,Toir1987,2010-06-23T07:47Z,"Its Cantonese not Japanese or some Asian language.
Its a Hong Kong film so its not possible for the original language to be Japanese."
