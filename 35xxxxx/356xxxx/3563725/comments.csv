[V],Kefissos,2006-11-24T06:46Z,"Mempan: The tracker url has to be http://tpb.tracker.thepiratebay.org/announce in your torrent. If not, piratebay will not accept your torrent."
[T],Shanklys Love Child,2006-11-25T02:56Z,"Thanks so much for this. I have this as a vinyl LP - but with different tracklisting - and am very happy to have it now in digital. 

Please post again if you have anymore 'Colourbox' - ""Arena"" was my all time favourite track of theirs. "
[V],Kefissos,2006-11-25T12:01Z,"Shankly: Most music from 4AD Records, include Colourbox, are great music.
I'll post ""Arena"" - soon or later ;-)"
