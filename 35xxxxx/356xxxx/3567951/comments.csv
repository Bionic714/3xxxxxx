,Mister Monroe,2006-11-30T19:11Z,All these ABBA-videos uploaded by RosaMannen are from ABBA - Kultnacht (Digital TV Rip). So he should not have any credit for this. Split an .mpeg file isnÂ´t that hard to do...
,Mister Monroe,2006-11-30T19:18Z,"He also put his own ""logo"" in the clips...so lame to take cred for other peoples work. 
So uncool."
[V],RosaMannen,2006-11-30T20:47Z,"who ripped it from the beginning?
is this dvd already released? i didn't know that i wasn't allowed to rip a bootleg-dvd.
i'm sorry if i have hurt someones feelings."

Thanks for all those videos you share!
Keep up the good work!
There's always some ""wise"" guys who make comments..."
[V],RosaMannen,2006-11-30T23:16Z,thank you Bluesbrother. I guess that people simply don't understand how much work I spend doing this. Hundreds of hours each month. But i'm glad you like my videos.
