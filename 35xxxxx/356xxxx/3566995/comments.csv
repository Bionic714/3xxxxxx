,TekLok,2010-10-16T17:49Z,Is this the original retail iso or is it a rip? 300 mb seems too small.
,TekLok,2010-10-17T22:26Z,Wait there was no version 2 released for PC. Only version 1 and blue burst. What is this anyways?

,GODblezhackers,2012-01-03T00:08Z,is this phantasy star 2?
,BigMaxx32,2012-04-30T23:08Z,"Only bad thing about this is you cant minimize.  It totally shuts down the game.  I got to level 5 and minimized to check out how to beat this dragon boss and all of my progress was deleted.  Other than that it's a fun game, although the sound doesn't work (however that could just be my computer)"
,Hiachi20,2012-05-24T10:34Z,BigMaxx32   sound works if you choose the server thats not JP server :/
,malcumsquirt,2012-07-13T07:54Z,"I have an issue with the sound. There are sound effects in the main menu, but no music or sfx during gameplay."
