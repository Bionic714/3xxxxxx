Juice was an Australian underground funk metal band of the early to mid nineties.

This Sydney band played a fiery fusion of hard funk, aggressive rock, psychedelia and soul (somewhere between Funkadelic, Led Zeppelin, Jimi Hendrix and the `stoned soul picnic' stylings of Sly and the Family Stone). Juice was one of a number of young bands at that time exploring diverse musical avenues on the traditional Australian pub-rock scene: d.i.g.'s acid jazz, Swoop's soulful funk grooves, Def FX's techno-metal, Skunkhour's funk'n'rap and Caligula's techno-pop. Amarnath and Krishna are the sons of Phil Jones who worked with The Unknown Blues in the 1960s, before travelling to the UK where he joined progressive band Quintessence. Lucius Borich is the son of guitar legend Kevin Borich.
