Thank's for nine AI package, a great work U have done.

p/s  VTBD (Don Muang)  The airport is now only in use for charter flights. I will go there in Jan 07.I have ticket."
,BaMordi,2006-11-28T15:54Z,"Noway is kind of fucked up :/

I'm seeing korean aircraft and malaysian... :P"
,C2007,2006-11-28T16:56Z,"Yes, i know. Some flightplans are #¤*/)&. :-(
That mess is being fixed to next release/update. It just going to take me some time to go trough it all. But it going to be fixed.

Whats fixed in this release, compared to ""Sim Traffic 2006 v1.0 Beta - Repack Edition"", is a lot of missing and faulty callsigns. Except for the military callsigns. They simply have to wait because every squadron have it's own callsign. So it's not going to be an easy job to fix ""TANTRiS Traffic Pack 2.5 MIL"".

Anyway, more fixes are on the way eventually."
,allen_x,2006-11-28T17:25Z,"hell, it'll kill yer fps"
,C2007,2006-11-28T17:58Z,"Planning to revoke this package and re-release it later when more fixes been made. Seeding a couple of hours more.

Until fixed, download my other package instead:

,mad_flyer,2006-11-28T19:32Z,"Awesome work! I really want the the Adobe 4.6 pack, but this is friggin nice!"
,monstert,2006-11-28T19:49Z,"The adobe 4.6 blows, Skytraffic and simtraffic are leading this game at this moment of time. I think the maker of adobe is a cunt..only offering it to Korean people is fucking way out of order.
Well done C2007, nuff respect for turning simtraffic into a master piece!"
,legendary_goku,2006-11-28T21:49Z,"monstert: you must be the biggest noob in history not knowing why they only release it to koreans

adobe ai doesn't blow it's a great ai package except for the outdated flightplans and some paints

just wait for popart he is going to release a huge combined traffic pack and i think that most of you guys know him so you know that he is the best when it comes to flight simulator packages uploads"
,Panodilo,2006-11-28T22:04Z,LMAO   -X-xX--%% Monstert
,PopArt,2006-11-29T00:19Z,"Yip legendary_goku, the package is getting shape. I hope I'll meet my deadline of december 31st though, but I'll try :) It is more work than I thought, but well worth it. Perhaps I'll release a sneak preview soon.

BTW, why didn't the Korean guys release it to others? I don't know the reason (but I'm no noob lol). Take care. "
,PopArt,2006-11-29T00:20Z,Could it be political?
,monstert,2006-11-29T02:35Z,"Yes Goku correct, i am the biggest noob of not knowing why they only release it to Koreans..wats ur point?..i mean come on..i made my point..nows its your turn!
Goku you either need to go take your head for shit OR, if you've got something to tell us about all of this adobe history bollox then why not tell us???????...thats if you have the balls!...instead of trying to be an internet warrior with the worst name calling i've ever seen on the internet.

And yes i'm extremely aware of PopArts immense Workflow."
,PopArt,2006-11-29T08:16Z,"@xaver_cox: aaah, those copyright laws. Gotta love them lol. They give you free bricks, so they just don't have to be wimps crying if I build a house with them. Get me? ;)

I think I will add some contact info in my initial release, so I can see if there's interest out there to form some kind of ""Adobe"" group to make this package the best there is! Exclusive for the Pirate Bay obvious.

Thanks for the offer, I will keep it in mind."
,legendary_goku,2006-11-29T09:22Z,"Ok but no need to say that the adobe traffic ai pack blows ;)

it's still very fps friendly and has some great models if you can disregard the aged flightplans and minor bugs but thanks to that developer we have a great ai pack and he gave us and especially popart the opportunity to create his super pack :)

well i am very excited :D well take your time no need to rush things popart :)

ik ben blij om te zien dat je nog steeds actief bent :) ik was een tijdje weg zonder internet naar het buitenland en ik ben blij dat er nog leven zit in FS9! :)"

,monstert,2006-11-29T11:51Z,"PopArt i think the copywright laws of the freeware paints are very flawed LOL.
They are the ones who are making models and painting real planes(do they get permission off boeing, british airways..etc?..yeah right!) and giving them out for free. What you are doing is the same as the maker of simtraffic, Skytraffic and adobe did... collecting the freeware into a bundle and simply giving it back out in mass...exactly the same as worldofAI but far better...but they still dont get it and start crying. Why people make freeware but dont want it given out for free i really cannot get my head around..its baffling LOL"
,BritneysOrifice,2006-11-29T15:32Z,"Yeah, that's what I don't understand about ProjectAI, AI-Aardvark, WorldOfAI, etc.. They create all these individual flightplans, thousands of little AI repaints and, in the case of WorldOfAI, boatloads of little installers.  But, like PopArt said, these idiots just don't get the big picture: EVERYONE wants a TOTAL package of AI, not fifty million installers and zipfiles that they have to laboriously install themselves.  What's the freakin' point of that???? Kudos to all who produce TOTAL traffic packages (and honors to Adobe for producing the first, and greatest package at the time -- beat the shit out of any payware traffic package, and I'd used them all). Thanks again, PopArt, C2007, Keiron, et. al. (By the way, PopArt... Adobe decided to distribute to Koreans only after 4.4 was downloaded by thousands of 'Westerners' who broadcast all about its merits on various flightsim forums. This made the AI league of ProjectAI, WorldofAI, etc. go apeshit and they bombarded Adobe with threats, letters of suit, blah blah blah.  Adobe said ""fuck the loudmouth Westerners"" and the rest is history.)"
,monstert,2006-11-29T19:43Z,"Thanks for the heads up BritneysOrifice , i wasnt even aware of why adobe did a korean only hand out...i take back what i said earlier..i was being a cunt LOL.
PAI, evolve ai, and especially world of gayI havent even got a leg to stand on when it comes to suits..i have massive respect for the models and paints that they make but it stops there really, cos as people they really act like a bunch of tossers..bollox to them!"
,Zorrotorro,2006-12-04T14:16Z,"Thanks!  I'll try this one out.  One question though, I have the adobe tp, but i cant find any military traffic?!  I did install tantris GA + military pack, but all i see is civil traffic from adobe and Tantris GA. Anything I do wrong?  And does anyone get any military traffic from this package? Please help!"
,Sambadelight,2006-12-07T02:07Z,"Tried this one but I must say I got really disapointed.. At the first airport, Gatwick, I saw small jets for northwest. Very likely.. The next airport i tried was Gardermoen (norway) and i saw a plane from the korean airlines. They have never flew Gardermoen. This made me uninstall the addon after 10 minutes. But of course, if you don't mind to have it so realistic, this is a very fine package. And yes, i know it's only beta. But nice upload anyway C2007"
,Zorrotorro,2006-12-07T09:30Z,"To : Sambadelight...

Have you tried the ADOBE AI TRAFFIC PACK 4.1?  Its a fine tp, exept for not getting any military activity.  Maybe I'm doing something wrong."
,Sambadelight,2006-12-07T15:02Z,"Nope, have not tried it.. Is it recommendable?"
,Sambadelight,2006-12-11T03:04Z,"Installed Adobe yesterday and as said earlier, a few flightplans are not up-to-date but still far more realistic than skytraffic.

And to zorrotorro: If you have installed the Tantris military pack, it should be installed. Just spend a few more hours at the computer and you will see them:)"
,C2007,2006-12-11T13:28Z,"UPDATE:

Working on an next releases of SkyTraffic. This time it comes in these four flavours.
- SkyTraffic 2007 1.0 Cargo Edition
- SkyTraffic 2007 1.0 GA Edition
- SkyTraffic 2007 1.0 MIL Edition
- SkyTraffic 2007 1.1 PAX Edition

And this time its all made from scratch instead of recompiling another traffic pack. Cargo and GA and MIL editions is not far from done and ready to release. But i might wait to realease them until PAX edition is ready too.

And PAX edition might take a week or so. It contains 135 different airlines at present and might grow with a few more."

Cheers for all your work.

,luke97,2007-01-06T13:47Z,"Tried it, but I still prefer Adobe´s 4.4. I never was able to find  the first file from Adobe´s 4.6, so I suppose this version would be even better than 4.4.
Tnx for the great efford, C2007. Maybe I will install both traffic packages, anyway."
,fspilot,2007-01-30T00:56Z,"sry 4 double post but I'll release a traffic pack too.

Popart can't get %2000000000000000 of the glory. ;)"
,dtr51751,2007-05-03T19:45Z,"Please, seed, Thanks for the hard work, provided I can install, but stuck at 2%"
,choroqstyle,2007-07-20T05:19Z,Where does the uninstaller go for this package? I can't seem to find it. Another thing i'd recommend for the next release is hiding the ai traffics from the aircraft select screen.
,choroqstyle,2007-07-20T05:25Z,"Disregard, I found the uninstaller. I'd like to highlight a few things though. I appreciate the hours you probably put into this package, however, it still has quite a few things that need to be worked out before it should be released in full. As some have mentioned, wrong aircraft in the wrong places. It seemed all my airports were lined with BBJs, including the Miami Dolphins team plane in Vienna, Austria. Also, as I outlined before, all the ai planes show up in the aircraft select screen in FS. 

Almost there, keep up the good work."
