My "Repack Edition" of "Sim Traffic 2006 v1.0 Beta" has grown. And it has
resulted in so many changes and fixes that I decided to release this
AI traffic package with its own name.

So here it is, "SkyTraffic 2007 v1.0".



The required HDD space on install is now approx 6.89Gb.

  IMPORTANT



IMPORTANT NOTES! 
=========================================================================

This AI package won't add any traffic to VTBD (Bangkok Don Muang Airport)
since that airport is closed in reality.

Instead it use VTBS (Bangkok Suvarnabhumi airport), which isn't added in 
FS9 by default. That's why it's important that you install the nice freeware
VTBS airport that comes with this package.

The freeware version is distributed and made by http://www.siamavsim.com. 

The site is in Thai but look for "VTBS 2006 Project" and you find it. 
Get the airport there if it isn't with this package. 

If you need a translator you could always use this one:

Hope you all enjoy this new release!
