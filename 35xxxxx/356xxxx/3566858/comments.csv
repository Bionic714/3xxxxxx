,anarkia,2006-12-11T18:15Z,"Yes it works, but with SwapMagic 3 discs it takes too f*n long to load. Why? Wrong type of dvd or what?
please answer. perkeleen perkele"
,KD17,2006-12-17T20:09Z,Make sure you're using a Sony DVD or a type that is supported. PS2's have trouble with Mexell's sometimes and other brands that you would think would work. I just always use Sony to be sure.
,Tampooni,2006-12-25T21:55Z,seed plz !
,milax1,2007-01-03T23:14Z,"For you guys having hdloader. it works perfect in mode3..

,KD17,2007-01-26T22:03Z,"It'll work with most DVD's, but some brands take longer to be recognized and loaded by PS2's."

,Hintzanator,2007-03-05T21:37Z,Can some Please write step by step instructions on how to burn it please? Its my first time burning a game
,KD17,2007-03-10T01:14Z,"Alright, first you need a modded PS2. That means you need to purchase a modchip or Swap Magic disc. Google for them. There are websites.

Second, you need WinRAR to extract the ISO. Then use DVD Decryptor to burn the ISO onto a blank DVD.(Mode - ISO - Write) As mentioned above, Sony DVD-R's work best. Enjoy!"
,KD17,2007-04-07T22:43Z,"1) Yes, you can play it with only the controller. (No Fun Though)
2) It's still better than paying $70.00-$80.00.
3)A guitar is only $40.00."
,KD17,2007-04-16T14:22Z,Could either be DVD you burned onto. Or if you're running HD or certain TV try turning on Calibrate Video or whatever it's called under the options.
,Phil_89,2007-04-21T10:50Z,"Thx for puttin this up KD17. Guitar hero 2 is an awesome game. I'm lookin for the first Guitar Hero too, but can't find it anywhere. if anoyne has the game and the time, could you put it up...plz?"
,KD17,2007-07-25T05:51Z,Sorry for the late response. I'll put Guitar Hero ! up tomorrow for anyone that still wants it.

,Kbizzle666,2008-06-15T15:06Z,"I don't get it..i extracted the file but all I get is a a lot of different folders and no ISO, anyone now why this is?"
