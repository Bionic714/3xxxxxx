Surveillance Tech

In the world of surveillance, Big Brother is not only watching, he's also listening, analyzing, recording, scanning, and tracking every aspect of our lives. And with advanced surveillance technology, there's virtually no place to hide.

SURVEILLANCE TECH examines some of the most important and potentially terrifying equipment the world has ever seen--or rather, not seen--in this thriving surveillance revolution. Check out parabolic microphones that pick up conversations a mile a way, cameras that learn what and who to photograph, RadarVision that "sees through walls", and Uninhabited Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). And explore the mind-bending future of surveillance technology, while, of course, reviewing its surprising history.
