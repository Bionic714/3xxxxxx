┬║ Driver Magician offers a professional solution for device drivers backup,  ┬║
┬║ restoration and update in Windows operating system. It identifies all the  ┬║
┬║ hardware in the system, extracts their associated drivers from the hard    ┬║
┬║ disk and backs them up to a location of your choice. Then when you format  ┬║
┬║ and reinstall/upgrade your operating system, you can restore all the       ┬║
┬║ "saved" drivers just as if you had the original driver diskettes in your   ┬║
┬║ hands. After one system reboot, your PC will be loaded and running with    ┬║
┬║ the required hardware drivers.                                             ┬║
┬║                                                                            ┬║
┬║ What's more, Driver Magician has a built in database of the latest drivers ┬║
┬║ with the ability to go to the Internet to receive the driver updates. It   ┬║
┬║ saves lots of time to find the correct drivers and mature drivers will     ┬║
┬║ obviously increase the performance of hardware. If there are unknown       ┬║
┬║ devices in your PC, Driver Magician helps you to detect them easily and    ┬║
┬║ quickly with its built in hardware identifier database.                    ┬║
