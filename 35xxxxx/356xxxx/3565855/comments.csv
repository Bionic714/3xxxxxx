,VicVega,2008-07-02T00:10Z,"Don't bother. Sound is weird, it sounds like when you have water in your ear."
,bwx0,2009-05-21T10:17Z,"Ignore the comments about the sound being problematic - it is fine.

The DVD menus are Spanish and the audio defaults to really bad quality dubbed Spanish, but select the English soundtrack and all is clear.

Also there is definitely sound all the way through."
