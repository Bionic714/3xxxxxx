Beverly Hills Cop III

Beverly Hills Cop III is a 1994 Eddie Murphy motion picture that was directed by John Landis, who had previously worked with Murphy on Trading Places and Coming to America. It was released on Wednesday, May 25 of that year, grossed a disappointing $44 million in the US and is the final chapter (so far) in the Beverly Hills Cop trilogy. Judge Reinhold reprises his role as Det. William Rosewood.

Production was temporarily shut down to allow the Paramount top brass the chance to get to grips with the film's spiraling budget. Originally estimated at $55 million, it was soon in excess of $70 million. Of that budget, $15 million was Eddie Murphy's paycheck.
