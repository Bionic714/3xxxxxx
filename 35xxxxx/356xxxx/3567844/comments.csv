,kenwood75,2007-01-04T15:06Z,The SRSSSC.exe is the crack!
,ultraman22,2007-01-09T10:41Z,"this is only the version on the official site, kenwood claims the srsssc.exe is the crack. if it is, how do i crack it ? please help"
,chni504,2007-01-10T19:31Z,Install as usual. Then copy the SRSSSC.exe you've got from the torrent to where you downloaded the program. 
,Omally44,2007-03-13T22:19Z,Is it just me or is ur cracked exe buggy?
,HazeyInDaHead,2007-04-28T01:58Z,"Has anyone found out if this is a virus or not?

The install missed a bunch of things like the configuration checklist, several gui issues... yeah..

Its like a half-assed exe with a ""crack"""
,JackoBill,2007-06-11T21:26Z,"""srsssc.exe"" included in this torrent is only 470kb.  The original ""SRSSSC.exe"" from the SRS Sandbox install is 3.01mb.  An Error Reporting Dialog pops up when I try to run ""srsssc.exe"" from this torrent."
,JackoBill,2007-06-11T21:33Z,Using the installer provided this torrent is fully operational.  Sorry for the previous comment.  This torrent is legit.
,rr_sookoo,2007-06-13T05:50Z,QUESTION : Does this program have any issues with sigmaTel Audio codecs (Dell PC's)
,phenrik,2008-04-27T19:10Z,"OMG!!!!
If u are using avg, or other types of antivirus. He wil find it as a threat because of thats what its supposed to do. U are altering a option or crack to the file. It is some sort of a virus. its working so deal with it.

Cheers Phenrik"
