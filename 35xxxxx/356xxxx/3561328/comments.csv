[T],kef71,2006-11-20T22:52Z,"5.1 DD, PAL (Read the title)"
[T],kef71,2006-11-20T22:55Z,"Ps. If the subtitles are : English, Swedish, Norwegian, Danish, Finnish and Dutch there's a 99.999% chance that the movie is PAL."
,svebi,2007-01-06T09:04Z,"Seede please. I have 99,9 %"
,ton4vg,2007-01-19T12:05Z,I need just 1% to reach 100. I waited for about 3 months for seeding. SEED Please. I promise to seed for another 3 months at least.
,LRN,2007-04-24T18:16Z,"Hey guys! We have one seed, i can see that. But it is 1 (one) peer i am actually downloading from (335 mb), other peers are just lowspeed loosers (93, 36, 35, 7 and 4 mb). And in the same time there is peers with highest percent downloaded among them (93 mb got 56%, 7 mb got 74%), while me and 335 mb both are stuck with ~36%.
WTF guys? My share ratio is more than 3 already! Seed this torrent. I won't even promise you that i will seed it for month or so. This is ridiculous! I am considering downloading this ( http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3653124/American.Beauty.1999.WS.Awards.Edition.Int.NTSC.DVDR-DVDHQ ) torrent instead"
