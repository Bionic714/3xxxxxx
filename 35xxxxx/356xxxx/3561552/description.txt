Movie was made in 1984. Low budget and a huge cast that is well known today.
Everyone from Pee-wee Herman to Micheal J Fox and MORE!

The movie is about a bunch of college kids in groups performing a scavenger hunt.
Very addictive movie and fun to watch.

Format is ripped from the DVD in .MP4 format 640x480 res. Nice and clean play in Apple Quicktime 7 with no problems.
