,jariku,2006-11-27T21:34Z,"I wouldn't recommend downloading these episodes as they're the edited versions (length ~24:24 mins) which were released on DVD in Japan and maybe some other countries.

Instead, you should look for the original uncut episodes which vary in lenght from 26 to 30 minutes each. Available on DVD worldwide, so finding DVDrips shouldn't be an issue."
,gompedyre,2007-08-07T04:21Z,"jariku, thanks for the warning. No downloading and further seeding of this, then. Those butchered episodes are far too widespread already considering how the quality is seriously degraded."
