,Booga23,2007-04-29T21:44Z,"Yes this is the full product but without the FlexLM license.
So basically useless unless you can get hold of a license file.
I use this at work every day and it is a brilliant package shame that this is no good for us at home. :("
,Booga23,2007-05-01T19:45Z,"I suggest you checkout the read me file in the Magnitude folder on disc 1.
I haven't got it working yet but I have Home edition and I think UG wont run on home."

,Boojum,2008-05-29T18:15Z,"   It's MAGNiTUDE release, of course it has crack/license/whatever, check their directory on CD1. I've just installed, works perfectly.

,gravelife,2008-10-15T08:03Z,"at first i was getting the same error...the solution is that u dont have to follow MAGNITUDE readme to the word...jst instal the license server first and when it asks for the license file jst point it to the .lic file with ur pc name as host. then instal nx4, reboot and run. and fyi...if u have IE7 installed in ur pc, then when u run u will get a visual c runtime error...to get around that go to UG instal dir\ugii and delete psapi.dll and u r good to go."
