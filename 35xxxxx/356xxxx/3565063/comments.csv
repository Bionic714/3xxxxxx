you can get both tracker addresses to work: right click on the line of this download, go to 'properties' and edit the lower tracker line adding an 'e' at the end (/announce instead of /announc )"

Western governments are pushing for the fascistization of the West, while people in the Middle East hate us because *their* governments run anti-west propaganda (just like our govts run anti-muslim propaganda)
The people both here and there should get together and kick some government ass, and that's when you need to know how to blow stuff up. Governments have armies, we don't."
,LucisFerens,2006-11-26T07:04Z,"btw, when did I say anything about smart terrorists?"
,kyd121,2006-11-26T08:07Z,"I see your point. One thing that I hate about the anti-terrorist movement is that they have lumped anarchy in with terrorism... funny how supporting anti-terrorism ties your own hands if you are any kind of anarchist, eh?"
,LucisFerens,2006-11-27T13:25Z,"huh? who talked about anarchy and anarchists?
I'm no anarchist."
