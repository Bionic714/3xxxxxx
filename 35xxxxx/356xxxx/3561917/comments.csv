,xero69,2007-02-11T02:04Z,"I download a lot of torrents but if you are dumb enough to trust your anti-virus to a complete stranger who posts a torrent... well, you deserved to get pwned.

You can download a free 30 day trial directly from the manufacturer if you just need to clean/check your system."
