,psut,2010-11-23T07:33Z,"That's why when I DO upload something, I make sure NOT to rar it.  Sure I don't put much up, but when I do - if it's something I've downloaded, I'll UNrar it first, and then create a new torrent.  It's f'n stupid when people do this, as it takes twice as much disk space to download and then extract it.  Morons upping s#it!"
