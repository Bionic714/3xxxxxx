,nimd4,2009-10-07T15:52Z,"0k, here's the deal:

1. duplot, it ain't broken. 
2. i've been seeding for weeks now, on a $hitty connection and the seeds keep decreasing; so, what are you doing: taking without giving makes you lame. 
3. ffs, update your torrent clients: you're holding everybody back. 

tnx, v1adimir"
