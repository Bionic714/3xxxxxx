,metris,2006-11-20T00:24Z,The keygen is what's hard to find... A working one anyways..

,metris,2006-11-20T07:30Z,"Thank you, but can't seem to get it to work. It says that the serial that's generated is invalid :) Oh well."
,fnaax,2006-11-20T08:03Z,"that's very strange you know, i installed it yesterday!

all you need to do is paste the installation code then generate the serial and after that the activation code, but i suppose you did that.

oh by the way, you have to choose the ""purchase"" option , then ""purchase by phone"". have you tried this one?"
,metris,2006-11-20T14:40Z,Oooh! I knew i had forgotten something :) THank you so much!
,fnaax,2006-11-20T21:21Z,:)
,Dreachnar,2006-12-25T14:59Z,the link to the keygen leads to downloading a virus.
,degamer,2007-01-19T00:56Z,"When I try to install, before I even have a chance to enter the serial, I get a ""serial not valid"" message.  How do I get past this?"
,gamez1,2007-01-24T20:36Z,"dont use any generator for painter 9.5, they are all fake. and contain troyan..."
