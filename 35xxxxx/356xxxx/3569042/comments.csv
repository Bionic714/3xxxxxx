,Nagi,2006-12-05T05:42Z,Thanks for the post. Lots of great music here. One tip when posting music packs like this one is not combining them all in one zip file. Just add the individual files to the torrent. That way people can exclude the ones they've already got when downloading the torrent.

Mulighet til å skaffe denne?"
,foffster,2006-12-16T22:39Z,"Instinkt har jeg ikke, dessverre, fordi jeg ikke har fått ut fingeren og skaffet siste albumet. "
,foffster,2006-12-16T22:40Z,"Nagi: Yeah, I know, but I´ve had some trouble uploading when I´ve added the tracks individually. "
,Espeland,2007-05-08T14:11Z,"Could you please upload a torrent with only Scum De La Norvége? I would really appreciate it, and I think many others would to..cuz there are no Scum De La Norvege torrents out there..."
