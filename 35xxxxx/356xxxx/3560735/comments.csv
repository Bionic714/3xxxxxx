1. Go to your root RMXP directory. (Usually CProgram Files\Enterbrain\RPGXP)

2. Right click RPGXP.exe and choose ""Properties"".

3. In the ""Properties"" popup, go to the ""Compatibility"" tab.

4. Check the box that says ""Run this program in compatibility mode for:"" and select ""Windows XP (Service Pack 2)""

5. Check the box that says ""Run this program as an administrator"".

6. If you cannoth check the box mentioned in step 5, follow steps 7 through 11.

7. Click on the button that says ""Show settings for all users"".

8. Click the ""OK"" button on the ""Windows needs your permission to continue"" button, after inputting the password of the specified administrator if necessary.

9. Check the box that says ""Run this program in compatibility mode for:"" and select ""Windows XP (Service Pack 2)""

10. Check the box that says ""Run this program as an administrator"".

11. Click the ""OK"" button.

12. Click the ""OK"" button.

13. Right click PSIKey.dll and choose ""Properties"".

14. In the ""Properties"" popup, go to the ""Security"" tab.

15. Click on the ""Advanced"" button.

16. Highlight the permission entry that says ""Users ([your computer's name]\Users)"" where [your computer's name] is whatever you named your computer. (Mine is Media-PC)

17. Click the ""Edit..."" button.

18. Highlight the group ""Users ([your computer's name]\Users)"".

19. In the popup that appears (It should be named ""Permission Entry for PSIKey.dll""), check the ""Allow"" box for the option ""Full Control"".

20. All of the ""Allow"" boxes below the box you just checked should now be checked as well.

21. Click the ""OK"" Button.

22. Check the box that says ""Include inheritable permissios from this object's parents"".

23. Click the ""OK"" button.

24. Click the ""OK"" Button.

25. Click the ""OK"" Button.

26. Run RPG Maker Xp, and you should no longer get the error message!

27. If you still get the error message, log into the administrative account on the computer and then run RPG Maker XP. It should work no matter what on that account, after you have successfully completed the above steps.


Anyways, great torrent. Thanks!"

,skylarkwings,2010-07-26T02:46Z,"If on windows 7 and you received ""failed to obtain serial number from the nTitles server"" :
1.exit and make a shortcut on the desktop (if it's not already there)
2. right click and choose ""troubleshoot compatibility""
3. follow the instructions on there
windows 7 is evil but I'm glad it's not vista.

Thanks a lot for the upload, working great so far!"
,kimb0slicee,2010-10-11T03:48Z,"Kwelllll, call me stupid or w/e but this is what I'm doing, and correct me for wtf I'm doing wrong PLZZZ!

I open the folder ""RPG Maker XP""
the following contents show:
Folder ""Setup1""
Folder ""Setup2""
thing tht says ""rmxpkegen""
& another that says ""SetupMenu""

I clicked ""SetupMenu"" & installed both of those things. & click ""Exit Setup Menu""

Now after that, there is abs NOTHING that says 
""Run"" anything.
& when I go to pull up the ""rmxpkegen"" it shows a box with three text-able things.
the first says ""Serial Number:""
and underneath is the box (that cannot be edited) with the following ""AKE84-WAUFB-Z84AD-OMMJK""

The next two boxes have over them ""Activation URL:"" then a blank (able to be typed in) textbox,
next a thing tht says ""Activation Code:"" then another blank (able to be typed in) textbox.

then 2 buttons.
""Generate"" and then ""Exit""

nothing generates if i press that, it says ""You must enter Activation URL!""

but idk where to find that. especially since there is nothing to run.

Within the folder ""Setup1"" are the following:
""InstMsiA""
""InstMsiW""
""RTP_Standard_102""
""Setup""
""Setup"" (Notepad doc that reads: ""[MSILoader] MSIFileName=RTP_Standard_102.msi"")

Inside of ""Setup2"" folder are the following:
""InstMsiA""
""InstMsiW""
""RTP_Standard_102a""
""Setup""
""Setup""(Notepad doc that reads: ""[MSILoader] MSIFileName=RTP_Standard_102a.msi"")

Pleasee just tell me what i have to DO!"

1. Install Setup 1

Make sure you dont leave empty lines in front of or after this. Should start with Windows and end with 29.
Save again. When prompted click yes. (if you leave blank lines at the top of the page, it will not work.)

This should take care of the problem for you."

,simis94,2011-03-24T11:53Z,"So what do I do if there is no ""Already Paid"" button?
The only choices that shows up are ""Buy Now"", ""Activate"", ""Continue"" and ""Exit"". ""Buy Now"" only redirects me to Enterbrain's official website, ""Continue"" doesn't work(because I've used my trial period), ""Exit"" does just what you would expect it to do, and ""Activate"" opens a new window where it asks me to insert the Product Key, along with my email and name. There is no ""Generate"" button or anything like that. plz halp"

,AnonK,2011-12-13T05:05Z,"I've followed a lot of things that have been said here.
I try to run the program RPG Maker XP. Nothing happens. Doesn't bring up anything whatsoever. I've uninstalled and reinstalled multiple times.
Any solutions?"
,sonnie460,2012-06-06T02:38Z,"thanks skylarkwings, and themightyhutch! worked like a charm."
,MrDenimLP,2012-07-28T18:02Z,"If there is anyone having trouble due to Ntitles server:

1} Go to wherever you installed the program
2} Right click on the RPG Maker XP icon, and click on 'Run as Administrator'

That should bypass and allow you to use the program. Hope this helps!
