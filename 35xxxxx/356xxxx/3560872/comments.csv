,TheLithium,2006-11-20T09:12Z,From what I've heard the quality of this rip shouldn't be too good. Just another one of those web-rips. Wait for the group releases!
,facelessmanchs,2006-11-20T14:35Z,Why don't you download it yourself and find out...sounds like a damn good 192K CD rip to me...anyone else have an opinion on it?
,TeveT,2006-11-20T20:16Z,"im afraid the first comment is right, the quality is quite poor.. volume shifts a couple of times atleast in the first song, and the second song i could say is even crap quality.. if its a rip made from a CD theyve done a poor job at it.. its good enough to get an opinion about his first album, but you should download it in better version if you really want to listen to it.. or buy it ;)"
,facelessmanchs,2006-11-21T18:51Z,ok...I have to agree...some of the song quality sucks...I have got my hands on the CD myself and created a direct rip at 320kbs - download it here:  http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3561924
,holdencee,2006-11-22T08:57Z,say forgive my ignorance but what specific software application should i have to be able to openthis file? and where can i get it? thanks!
,facelessmanchs,2006-11-23T00:26Z,do a search for torrent programs...if you can't figure it out after that - you shouldn't even be on this site
,ronaldl,2008-01-27T16:04Z,And nobody can tell us not to download this fucked up torrent? Sound is weird and the songs don't end when they should. Don't Download!

,PsychopathicMetal08,2009-01-26T18:49Z,"holdencee, you seriously shouldn't be here unless you know exactly what you're doing, it's just a bad idea but the only way you'll understand torrents is to learn from mistakes and I was in your posistion about 3 years ago not knowing that much about torrents and had only a basic idea of how to work them but I got familiar with them and now I understand them fully. I suggest getting only simple small torrents first as a kind of practice even if you don't keep what you download. Just for experience."
