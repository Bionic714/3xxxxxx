Demos!

______________________________________________

These songs in this format are not what a
group would normally have you hear. They are
our aural sketchpad,the first outlines of what
eventually will become a fully fledged
album. They are naked and gawky,like a
nesting chick,not yet ready to fly.

This stage is where we decide if a song will
make the album or not and these are some of
the fringe competitors. Maybe with the right
approach some of them will develop and
thrive,but when you have a lot of material the
axe has to fall somewhere.

With the interest shown on the website for
demo material we decided to let this stuff be
heard. I hope you find it interesting. For me it┬┤s a
little like wandering on stage in your
underwear,now there┬┤s a thought.
