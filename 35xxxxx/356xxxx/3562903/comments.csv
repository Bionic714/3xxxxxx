,Carbamide,2006-11-23T01:59Z,Thanks for the upload!
,Carbamide,2006-11-23T02:41Z,"I just finished making thumbnails for FSX for these and the other Classis Freighters upload.  Where would be a good place to host them so that you guys can get them.  I know uploading freeware is kinda' frowned upon here at tpb, but I don't think avsim or other sites like that would accept them without me first getting AeroSim's permission."
,chaos_dreamhelper,2006-11-23T03:09Z,Cool...thanks 4X-AXG
,Carbamide,2006-11-23T04:16Z,"Ok, here are all of the thumbnails that I've created.  They're for all Aerosim aircraft, the Alphasim B-52, the freeware Antonov an225, CLS 310-200, 340-500, 340-600 and 300-600/Beluga and some project Opensky planes.

I hope this helps someone.  There are no viruses are anything like that in here, but you're free to check.

The file weighs in at 9.something megs.
