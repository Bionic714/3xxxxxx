
Tony Mansfield's Search Party - Urban Foxes Limited 12" vinyl rip (1983)

I know a lot of you people out there collecting clips from New Musik etc are looking for this 12" version of Urban Foxes. This was the non-picture 12" sleeve. Ripped from the original 45rpm 12". You can hear a few clicks&pops and even a few studio tape drop-outs (!) RARE! (I think, until now,)
