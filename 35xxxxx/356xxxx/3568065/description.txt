From the uprising St. Croix-based quintet Midnite comes Unpolished, a rare debut album. Beginning with "Bushman," a mesmerizing, one-away tune, the set's 10 tracks captivate with hypnotic Afrocentric incantations, chants and jams. Though the press notes liken the band's sound to Lucky Dube, another more subtle comparison describes their musical identity and spiritual foundation as well. Though more "raw" and "unpolished," their harmonies, riddims and messages of Black Pride and Rasta Power, place them as "spirit" descendants of Misty in Roots, the sublime UK Rastafarian collective.

Midnite uses potent, original imagery mixed with Rasta livity's mighty credos to reach spiritual Ites on songs like "Kaaba Stone" ("I am the original corner stone . . . they don't know love . . . destroying the blueprints, so no one can see, who is the original and who is the copy"). Their urgent harmonies--driven by Ital (non-digital) beats ranging from one drops to hard steppers--ignite warrior chants like "Due Reward," which exalts, "Lift up your head, Selassie I, I and I chant Rastafari, tell them come look inna the Lion's eye." The set's final track, "Time and Time Again"--though propelled by a rolling dance rhythm--is a special love song with the haunting lyric, "Jah give I a beautiful girl of his own personal design. . ."

This is original, crucial music for the heavens, the heart and the soul.
