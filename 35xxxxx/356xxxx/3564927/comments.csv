I haven't seen this file available anywhere so I decided to create my first torrent. I was surprised at how quickly people started to download it! My seeding is finished, but I'll check once in a while to make sure it's always available.

My thoughts on the video: although the quality is excellent, being professionally filmed, it just doesn't do justice actually being there (as with any Cure show, of course). The vastness of the amphitheatre and the massive crowd... And the sound mix could've used more of the audience. But how lucky those of us who were at the concert are to have this memento!

Enjoy! (And seed please!)"
,golinsche,2008-06-23T16:03Z,thank you very much! It's really fun to watch it!
,AbrashTX,2008-07-13T18:42Z,"Gamma Mike, thanks for uploading! 

I finished leeching but my upload has simply stopped, so I can't seed! Anybody have any ideas what's wrong? My router and firewall are configured correctly AFAIK. "
