,MagnumOne,2006-12-06T22:47Z,"FYI; this disc did not work for the nav system in my car, an Audi A6 -05 with MMI."
,Freddiz,2006-12-10T20:53Z,"So, do you unpack it with Winrar or???"
,rs2,2006-12-11T08:42Z,HELP!!!!!!!So how do you extract and burn this app?
,kurtzuegg,2006-12-12T17:46Z,"Hello everybody, the image has been extracted with  CloneCD by SlySoft and you need CloneCD to burn it on a good quality (possibly Verbatim) double layer DVD. Please note that with some DVD writers you cannot make a working copy (I don't know why) but as the original seeder is saying if you use a Pieoneer-111 DVD writer you can be sure to obtain a working copy (he was able to burn one for me which works great). Please refer to the NAVplus forum (http://www.navplus.us/forum/viewtopic.php?t=1694) to have more details on what DVD writers can burn a working copy of this navigation DVD. Good luck!"
,alexandru06,2006-12-19T20:31Z,"Hello! Dont work! I write with CloneCD, writer was NEC AD 5170A last model, media Traxdata DVD + RDL. More then that, computer after I instal CloneCD5291 dont work propriety. I star computer in Safe Mode and I uninstal this CloneCD and just after start to work. Everyone, have care! Bye, thank you for this seed."
,rs2,2006-12-21T16:42Z,"Hello. I cant get this to work. I only gets a software update DVD to sw 460, for RNS-E, and the navi part dont work. So if you have a old version dont use this , because if you update your RNS-E then you cant use your old DVD navi disc."
,NoP0int,2006-12-22T12:15Z,Is there any way to burn this with a mac? Or do you need CloneCD?
,tailwill,2006-12-25T21:14Z,Pefect with pioner 111D v 1.23  and verbatim dl 8.5 gb ( clone cd v 5.3.0.0) for experimental purposes of couse

,bieshose,2007-02-23T16:01Z,"Use clonecd www.slysoft.com

Also use Verbatim DL + dvd and set your booktype to dvd-rom (update also your dvd player firmware)

After this,,,, mine still did not work...."
