,stefanholland,2006-12-04T18:56Z,"About the password, this could be it...

""No password is required. Windows has a maximum file length for a path/file. If you unzip the files to an already long path, such as a directory on your desktop, you can exceed the maximum file length allowed by Windows. The uncompression tools do not know how to handle this error and, instead, incorrectly assume a password is required. To solve the problem, simply unzip the files to a short path, such as c:\autodesk"""
