DirectX Error

DirectX(R) encountered an unrecoverable error.

Check the DirectX(R) FAQ for possible solutions.


Things that I've done:

1. I've installed the 1.3 patch.

2. I've applied the 1.3 crack from gamecopyworld.

3. I've tried running the program as administrator.

4. I've tried setting the computability as xp service pack 2 and running as administrator.

Any help would be appreciated!!

,[X]Kaibar,2008-11-12T01:53Z,"This is very simple. 

1. Download the Torrent, and Launch in torrent downloader program. ( Bit Torrent is what I use. )

2. After download finishes, open the folder named ""Call of Duty 2"" that you just downloaded. There will be a CoD2_SP .exe file, Call of duty 2.daa, and a keygen.exe.

3. Mount the .daa using a .iso program. ( I used UltraISO. Yes, the .daa WILL mount. ) 

4. Now, minimize UltraISO, open ""My Computer"" and find your ISO drive. ( Commonly the (J:) drive. It should be labeled ""CoD2DVD"". Double click ""CoD2DVD"" and find the setup.exe.

5. Be sure to run the ""Keygen.exe"" from the original torrent download folder and generate a unique key to enter at setup!

6. When the setup completes, return to the original ""Call of Duty 2"" folder downloaded from the torrent, and copy the CoD2_SP.exe sile into the C:/program files/Activision/Call of Duty 2/ folder, overwrite the original exe.

7. When wanting to play, use the new CoD2_SP.exe to play the single player game. Make sure to patch your multiplayer client to play the multiplayer!!!!"

installation worked fine, had to get PowerISO but hey, so what.  copied crack into game registry etc.  tried to play, was told ""file mss32.dll"" was missing.  game will not play.

from what i can gather from the few legitimate posts prior to this, I am not the only one to have this problem.  Is this a vista issue?

THEN DRAG YOUR NEWLY DOWNLOADED .DLL INTO THAT SYSTEM32 FOLDER!! NOTE:DO NOT, I REPEAT DO NOT DRAG THAT .DLL INTO A SUBFOLDER IN SYSTEM32 BECAUSE IT WILL NOT WORK, DRAG IT TO THE WHITESPACE IN THE SYSTEM32!!!!!!!

Emm. Your problem is that you do not know how to install. Download Daemon Tools (Google it) and install. After you have downloaded Call Of Duty, run Daemon Tools and create a virtual disk.

*After installation copy files in DiVENCE folder to the folder where you installed the game.

,josefnouicer,2011-08-17T22:04Z,"not trying to be arrogant, but i really didnt think that so many of you were noobs at installing games? 

1. mount the files, get a key, install the game.
2. go to your cod2 folder
3. open the main directory, put the crack there, replace.
4. look for the latest patch (google is your friend)
5. if you have a key code that's already been used, use Tunngle. (Youtube has plenty of tutorials on how to play games using Tunngle.
6. ??????
7. Profit"

1. Mount the image with as an example Daemon tools or PowerISO
2.Install the game using key you can get from keygen in download folder, if it won't work try to download different keygen or search the internet for key
3. Copy the crack (COD2SP) to your installion folder and replace the orginal file with it
4. then enjoy the fucking game it's not harder than that :DD"
