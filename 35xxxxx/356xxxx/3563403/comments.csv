,ursule,2006-11-23T20:37Z,Can you tell me what version this is? I bought the UK dvd and it has 2.0 sound and forced english subs. Does this one have 5.1 sound?
,Turbo Warrants,2006-11-23T20:55Z,"This is the UK version with forced subs.

Cannot see weather this is 5.1, all it have on the back is the Dolby Digital logo but when I access the soundtrack in VLC it says ""Dolby Surround"".
Unfortunately my speakers are left in Sweden so I cannot test if it is indeed surround sound.

I was also rip and upload Taxi 2 and 3 tomorrow if my mate remember to bring it."
