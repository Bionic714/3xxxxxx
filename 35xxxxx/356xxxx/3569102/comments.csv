,Laughing Acklay,2006-12-02T17:21Z,"Got the file, but I'm not sure which RAR file to unpack first. Could someone point me in the right direction?"
,MeWii,2006-12-02T17:53Z,thanx dude keep them coming! ur my #1 source :p
,mawes,2006-12-03T00:48Z,"Seems like this is the real thing! Had a lot of trouble with the false ""OrenJi""... Spent all day removing malware! Keep on the good work!"
,mawes,2006-12-03T00:52Z,"Ooh! If this is also a .rar file containig another .rar file which is pw protected, please don't bother. It's a fake. It will just download a lot of malware to your computor."
,mawes,2006-12-03T00:56Z,"At least it is loading fast, 300 MBytes/sec, so I will soon know!"
,mawes,2006-12-03T01:24Z,"Well... Download is finished. I got a warning from SuperAntiSpyware and I choosed ""heal"". The downloaded file is still ""battlestar.galactica.s03e09.ws.dsr.xvid-orenji.avi.bc!"", so I guess that it contains some sort of malware anyway... "
,vurna123,2006-12-03T15:27Z,I dont now how you guys can have any problems unpacking this file seeing its an .avi
,Tombe^,2006-12-04T11:17Z,"Yeah, if you click the file link on top of this page you will see what files this torrent contains people, don't be stupid. There is no viruses or malware in this file."
,allmypeople,2006-12-07T17:40Z,"The tension and emotions that are let loose in the episode are stunning and the acting is incredible.

I'm not going to give anything away but there's a scene when Adama informs someone some startling information... The character gets floored and we feel it too.

This episode shows why this series is so universally praised."
,pulsarkuant,2007-12-06T02:09Z,The worst episode of the galactica. I hate whore Kara.
