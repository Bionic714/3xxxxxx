,redcore,2007-03-25T12:48Z,"At first I didn't really know if I wanted to download this mostly because I don't know much about him. I watched him a few times on American Idol and I thought he was good but I didn't see a lot of range...but I guess that's what happens on the shows where they make everyone sing a certain artist. I seen that Slash plays on one of the albums, and as a big G'n'R fan it pushed me into going ahead and trying it out.

Pretty good album. Some good rock music...even though it's not ALL that unique. Good first album for anybody, for sure. Great rip :)"
