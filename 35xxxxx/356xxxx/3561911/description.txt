READ THIS:
SPLiNTER did a nice job releasing this Disc before us, but their's is DTS
only.... still not everybody has a DTS decoder build in so here we are to
bring u the one within dvd standards (minimum dd5.1) left on it.
also we don't see any avg.bitrate in their nfo so we have some doubts about
it...Tip of the day for SPLiNTER: Put .DTS.ONLY. in dirtag nextime

Enjoy.....
