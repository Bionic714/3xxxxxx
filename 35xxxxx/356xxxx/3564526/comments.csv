,Starwolf,2006-11-28T23:03Z,"Dont bother to dl unless you speak czech caus even when you fix the game to the english language with the owar config file,and the patches, it still shows up in czech text and audio.""the game is the real deal and kicks ass"" but the language thing is a Big freggin problem"""
,Starwolf,2006-11-29T00:25Z,"never mind i figured out how to convert it ""txt only just dl the latest patch and follow the directions below.
You can get the text in English if you have 1.05 (i think it started in 1.05) and up. Basicaly add #ENG to the OW shortcut on the start menu. 

i.e 

""C:\Program Files\Virgin Interactive\Original War\Owar.exe"" #ENG 

That should allow you to see the text in english but sound will be in whatever the game is in (There is no russian version AFAIK) 

 To all who were looking for this ""your welcome and have fun "" :D"
