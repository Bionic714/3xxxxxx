Bo wonder these terrorists are so bad, they are following ""In the Footsteps Of the flalse Prophet Muhammad."" May he burn in hell"

,evilscarycomputergeek,2006-11-23T06:52Z,"to the millenium man, thank you for all your racial slurs.  it is people like you that make the world such a great place.  thank you for making fun of muslims and accusing the Holy Prophet of doing things he never did.  And FYI, if you were to read anything about islam, besides the literature by misguided people like you, you would see how good islam truly is.  Oh, and on the day of resurrection, you may be surprised to see who will be going to hell.  That is all.  Oh, and user88, thank you for the upload.  Unfortunately, i don't have enough seeds to properly download it.  But inshallah, you will be rewarded for the da'wah.  Jazakallah hairum."
,bl00dcl0t,2006-12-10T03:58Z,"This series is quite interesting. Watched first few episodes, quite informative even if you're not islamically inclined. The quality is OK except for the first episode. Subtitled. I'm seeding it.

My advice: DL.

,Slomadia,2009-07-31T16:29Z,"@ MIlleniumman: I see your very profound insight into the issues of Islam, and I guess you must have read a lot. I advise you to learn something and then to talk. I also advise you to check a book by Michael H. Hearts called ''the 100'' and see who's on the first place.
may God show you the right way.
Peace"
