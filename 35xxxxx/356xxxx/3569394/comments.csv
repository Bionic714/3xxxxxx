,funnelweb40,2009-01-06T12:56Z,"the keygen didn't work for me either. You have to type the individual letters and numbers in the keygen manually. Then once you enter a serial, you need to exit, and restart the activation process, that should get it working. You can past your activation code though."
,Shadowshail,2010-01-07T11:00Z,"Sorry for this but i am having a little problem....

I followed the instructions on the file to the letter and downloaded it. the problem is it wont start up, it just gives me this message:

The program can't start because d3dx9_26.dll is missing from your computer. Try reinstalling the programto fix this problem.


So i uninstalled it and reinstalled it and it is still giving me that message. Any help would be amazing."
