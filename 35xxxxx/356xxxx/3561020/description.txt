Tales From The Wind In The Willows
Read by: Peter Hawkins


Stories from the classic "Wind In the Willows". This is only the first four storys of the book, because this is is all the twin cassette version I had has. However I really like this version of the Wind in The Willows, and Peter Hawkins makes a very good rendition of it, and puts on some great voices.
