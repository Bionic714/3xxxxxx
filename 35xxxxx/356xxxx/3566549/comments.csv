Don't be put off by the fact that it says that there's only 1 seeder.   I already have a 3.4 ratio and plan on seeding it for as long as possible.   This movie rocks and deserves to be shared."
,oddmanoutgt,2010-10-08T23:41Z,I'm still seeding.  I'm up to a 5.033 ratio.   Later days.
,oddmanoutgt,2010-10-26T07:48Z,"Well, it's been weeks and nobody has been downloading.  So I'll have to leave it at a 5.273 ratio.   Thank U immensely to the uploader.  Later days."
