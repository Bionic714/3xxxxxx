For those who experience sound loss, is your soundcard onboard your motherboard? If it is, the card is most likely to be an AC-97 soundcard. Simply google ""AC97 soundcard drivers"" and you should find several pages full of drivers.

My thanks again Shashank,

Is ther a way one can install the update without some of the add-ons? Just wondered as there are a number of items on there that have the potential to cause conflicts with my Anti virus software and internet configuration.

Perhaps you might want to think about providing the core programs as an unattended in your next release and all the extras such as -

***************
Yahoo Antispyware
Yahoo Central
Torrent Harvester
Sodabush Folder Wallpapers
Google talk
***************

 - optionals that people are able to choose whether to install or not.

Thanks ;)"

THE ONE PROGRAM  OF ALL YOU NEED THE MOST IS A GOOD ANTI VIRUS/ FIREWALL SOFTWARE WHICH WILL PICK UP ON THESE MALICIOUS PROGRAMS EMBEDDED IN WHAT SEEMS AN INNOCUOUS FILE SEEDED BY SHIFTY AND MALEVOLENT INDIVIDUALS i.e (Shashank Mishra)

I see some program that i want to have but they i really want is missing . so i rather download them myself and the input them on a USB device or CD .

In youre next release i can give you my opinion 
Clean Windows Install 
Dizzy - NFO viewer
Winrar - Rar Archives *simpel one*
Deamon Tools - Cd mounting
WinAmp - well whe all like MP3
VLC MP - works like clockwork
and some good Codex

and plz this time exclude the PCKILL malware

,poochy,2007-08-11T21:41Z,"Well this is the coolest XP i've seen in along time(been threw alot). As other's have mentioned you could skip all the programs though..

1 Problem im getting a svchost virus flag up, anyone experienced this, does this windows have a backdoor, and how to remove it? any answers would be greatly appreciated.."
,trekiehb,2007-09-18T18:42Z,Love this MW!! my computer never ran so well!!
,Keyholder,2007-10-20T18:41Z,"For the Kiddies n Muppets out there.. u lot know who u r. How... Well u moan like little school kids..

Anyhows.. to the real stuff and away from the lame asses...

Simple instructions to install this version of windows Xp Mw.

1. Download image.
2. burn the image to a cd/dvd. ( i used 16X with nero & alcohol 120 )
3. Do NOT try to load from windows. Use as a bootable cd!!
4. Unplug LAN cable if u conect to the net via lan - see OTHER INFO Below
5.Restart pc n Boot from Disk
6.Sit back and watch it install.
7. YOUR DONE.

Xtras u will need to do.. 

Uninstall software that u wont use..
Change the Pc name / manafacture etc if u so wish
Change the Location to your country of choice
Change the Language to your choice ( set to U.S default) 
And Njoy the fast response of your computer with this version of windows.

*** OTHER INFO ***...Check the Most wanted folder on the disk to Install IE7 before u connect to the net other wise IE7 will not be shown as genuine.

You Will Get a Virus warning twice for the Jellybean Key maker / Revealer..( KEYFINDER) DO NOT be worried about it. Theres no security risk with it or Privacy Risk.

My Laptop is running 46 Processes at the mo ( centrino 1.7, 1gb ddr2,2 meg L2 cache Single core),and it out performs my Athlon64 (939) 2.2Ghz pc with microsofts version of windows.. And belive it or not it still flys.. No Menu delays.. no crashes, no BSOD, etc

This is probably the best version of windows xp you will find in a long time.

It is Reliable, Updatable, and least of all FAST. There are no missin files, no corrpted files either.  ive got this widows installed on 4 pcs in all.. and not one install has gone rong and not one machine is doing what it wants..

Hopeflly this has  Answeared a few of other peoples questions.

,wtcamer,2007-12-04T06:59Z,really wish ppl that don't know shit about software wouldn't go yelling virus b/c there antivirus is saying this may be an unwanted program... u know why? b/c your just posting a useless comment... pskill is a software used in MANY installs. It's just for silent installs and such... not a virus... even tho u could use it in conjunction with one... it can never actually be the virus it has no malicious use... so just shut up trying to sound smart when u dont' know wtf your saying.
,libertard03,2008-01-27T05:51Z,Don't bother if u think something suspicious.  Never knows what's inside. We have lots of XP to select for so choose the simplest full version that works

,arata75,2008-02-15T02:31Z,"I've got a question:

Won't Microsoft find out that this is pirated via windows update? Or did you uninstall that? And if they do realize it's pirated, then will they deactivate it or will I just won;t be able to get upgrades?"

,arata75,2008-06-13T20:09Z,"This is horrible... he put a whole crapload of fake Vista stuff in it and it doesn't look right. The default screen resolution is like 600x800 or something like that, but you can change it. There's a bunch of crap programs that comes with it, and the whole thing is bloated and slow. I give it negative 5 stars."
,steve9876,2008-06-19T13:54Z,"Shashank: Great release! Just a few problems:

1. I don't use a lot of the stuff installed

2. The product key is dected as NON-GENUINE.
For the other users that are having problems with this, please download:

,inxis,2008-08-12T17:52Z,"Quite a few software up loaders attach a automated installer which is often recognized as a malware,yes people also upload malaware.
This site is all about sharing software that may not suit everyone's requirement but respect his effort   sacrifice of   bandwidth /time.
There are quite a few impotent  fagots , spawns of whores, who are frustrated as not even a syphilitic dog would oblige them while  their wives sisters busy in pornographic creativity for the net beneath horses and dogs.
These pathetic s have no other recourse but to turn racist, bigots to ease the pain .Ignore them"

,mr.grinch1,2008-09-18T22:21Z,works great
,Blacker73,2009-01-17T03:36Z,"Good idea, terrible execution, sorta like NASCAR except in a pirated version of XP. Way too much junk, makes a spectacular computer run very slowly(specs: amd 9850 o/c'ed to 3.1 on a w/c loop with ram and HDD's, asus crosshair II formula, 8 gigs dominator ram, 3 bfg 8800gtx's on sli, all on a single w/c loop, 2 velociraptors, 1 raptor x). Decent idea bud, but I think you should get to learn a little more about modifying windows before you take on a project like this."
,sonictrip,2009-01-30T21:42Z,"Why are people complaining about this? I think its an excellent version of XP. Just uninstall the bits of software you dont like...

I have it installed on 2 laptops and its running very fast, even on an old compaq n600c! Windows open really fast, as does the programs list, love it. Some great little tweaks indeedy.

I think people that are having speed problems with this probably dont have their hardware drivers installed, such as the Intel CPU drivers and graphics card drivers being the most important. Make sure you install all your Windows drivers before commenting on this torrent.

Remember, this was released back in 2006 so for the time it was very advanced! And it still is now too in 2009!

Thank you Shashank Mishra! Keep them coming! :)"
