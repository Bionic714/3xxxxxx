,Bandito77,2007-06-28T23:16Z,"Dont download... Screws with and modifies lsass.exe a SYSTEM executable and restarts your computer every time SUPERantispyware is run. Also noticed problems with Windows Media Player and the Search toolbar... nothing you cant fix though
if you downloaded this and your having trouble fixing your computer let me know and i can help walk you though it
i suggest downloading this one: http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3637548/SUPERAntiSpyware_Professional_version_3.6
oo and by the fuck you poznasi"
