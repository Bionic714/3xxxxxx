I am outside of the market and you're the only one putting these games on the net. Keep them coming bud. They are certainly appreciated by many!

I posted your torrents in an NFL/NCAA torrent forum called Ten Yard Torrents located at http://forums.tenyardtorrents.com/. If you join the forum, mention your name so I can send you a message. Thanks again for all that you do for us unfortunate individuals outside of The Mtn Sports Network market. "
