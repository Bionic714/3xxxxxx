,Linders,2006-12-01T04:09Z,oops just saw alot of other torrents cancel this one
,nofelching,2006-12-01T04:12Z,"Oh no, I think those are all fake, or at least the first comment says they are for all the ones I can see."
,Gisselo,2006-12-01T04:21Z,"all the other are fake, dont cancel this one"
,A-C-i-D,2006-12-01T04:34Z,"fan va nice :D , har väntat fett länge på den här (: tack."
,Linders,2006-12-01T04:34Z,"Sigh, why do they upload fakes..."
,Linders,2006-12-01T04:35Z,"Btw if you already have downloaded this somewhere else, dont make a new torrent, just help seed this one. Alot easier."
,d00m1001,2006-12-01T04:37Z,Who the hell knows why they upload fake ones.. oh well I think this one is real... NoTV is pretty good.
,Gisselo,2006-12-01T04:47Z,they upload password protected RAR files and make you go and reg on some site filled with spyware and shit

[T],Tedsharer,2006-12-01T06:55Z,this is nuked.  20% of the screen is missing in bad cropping
[T],Tedsharer,2006-12-01T06:59Z,PROPER: http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3568399/Scrubs.S06E01.PDTV.XviD.PROPER-LOL
,sigpimpin,2006-12-01T07:01Z,using 7zip i can't even get it to extract. says the file is broken. don't bother to download this.
[T],Tedsharer,2006-12-01T08:07Z,deleted proper. was corrupt. EZTV has it though
,iverzzon,2006-12-01T09:00Z,"tack så jävla mycket, har väntat sen i mitten av maj på det här! mille grazie :)"
,fnurf,2006-12-01T15:16Z,bad aspect ratio
,juggernuter,2006-12-07T21:59Z,asså älskar scrubs.. nån som vet när nästa ep kommer??
[T],Tedsharer,2006-12-07T22:23Z,imorrn såklart.
,greylion,2006-12-10T23:55Z,"Wrong aspect ratio / bad cropping. Maybe NoTV thinks everybody has a 1280x1024/5:4 screen? I certainly don't (1680x1050/16:10).
Don't waste your time with this release, if you want the maximum screen area."
,turkmatta,2007-04-28T19:42Z,"PLEASE seed, im on 15kB/s"
,gaffya,2008-07-01T22:39Z,all right assholes its really simple right click on the torrent name then on bandwidth allocation click high. fucking scumbag leechers should be shot
