,ogge_,2006-12-05T23:23Z,How come the aspect ratio is all fucked by default?
,X0NE,2006-12-06T08:04Z,"ogge,when i put this movie 2gether it was meant for my own personal use so i converted it to FS so the video would fill the screen when i burnt it to dvd.dont worry its easily fixed if u read above.ive seen all the other borat clones and they all suck bigtime on the audio and subs department.this will do til something better comes along..ie TC or SCREENER..btw i fit casino royale,borat and jackass2 on a dvd with 3dmenus using nero7 super long play.all good"

Well....  Probly 'cuz its encoded with the wrong aspect ratio. But i seen it before even in dvdrs.. VLC (www.videolan.org) has some settings that can correct it, so it can be watch with a normal picture."
