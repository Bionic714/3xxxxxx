,Rbarba23,2006-12-28T00:41Z,"Just converted my first video file, one that MinXMedia AVI iPod Converter wouldn't convert. That one costs money and doesnt actually convert all of the media files, even with their suggested ffdshow codec pack. This one converts at the same speed, is free, and seemingly works on every movie file. Thanks Any Video Converter! And thanks for the upload as well!"
