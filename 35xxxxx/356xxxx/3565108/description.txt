Super Speeders 2: Across America

The Super Speeders are back with 120 minutes of high-speed, high-stakes action. Super Speeders 2: Across America takes street racing to an entirely new level. Tour the carefree lifestyle of exotic car owners from coast to coast and watch as they leave the cops in the dust and reaching for their radios. These thrill seekers unload every ounce of horsepower from their modified motors onto the highways and boulevards of Las Vegas to Los Angeles to New York City. Get ready to see things nobody else could possibly show you - from a 480 foot burnout in a $500k SLR McLaren to powersliding a $2 million Pagani Zonda race car - from the birth of an 850HP Corvette to the death of a Lamborghini Gallardo. You're about to embark on a ride you won't soon forget.
