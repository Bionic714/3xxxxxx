That key doesn't even exist on PCs more recent than Windows 98/ME... if you're running 2k/XP it's worthless, they don't even have VxDs.  And second, changing the TCP window size is not going to have a very big impact on performance.  Somebody just put together a collection of semi-random changes to network settings for really old OSs... it's mostly harmless, but won't benefit you any."
