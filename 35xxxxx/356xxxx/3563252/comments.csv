Picture quality and audio are very nice and definitely watchable.

,Digital_Guy,2006-11-24T03:48Z,"I'm using a Mac. with 10.4.8.  I've installed all of the DivX/XviD components, but still do not know how to use the(se) file(s).  There are 2 main folders, named ""CD1"" and ""CD2"", and a file named ""pukka-cr.nfo"".   In each of the ""CD1"" and ""CD2"" folders, there are files named ""p-cr1.r00"" through ""p-cr1.r47"" and ""p-cr2.r00"" through ""p-cr2.r47"", along with files named ""p-cr1.rar"" and ""p-cr1.sfv"", and ""p-cr2.rar"" and ""p-cr2.sfv"".  Attempting to open any of these files with either the QuickTime or DivX applications will not work.  Again, remember, I have all of the DivX and XviD components installed into the ""/Library/QuickTime"" folder.  Any help that would allow me to view the(se) file(s) would be appreciated.  In advance, thank you."
,shakewell,2006-11-24T03:57Z,"OK, does anyone who knows about RAR encryption have comments on quality?..."
,ameneonX,2006-11-24T04:02Z,"wtf??? aztekkrille, if your swedish and doesn´t learn english in school then you´re either WAY to young to watch this movie, or just too retarded to pay attention in class. Of course you learn english in school. I know, cause i´m norwegian."
,Nocturn3,2006-11-24T04:16Z,"This torrent already exists, with many more seeders here: 
http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3559775/Casino.Royale.TELESYNC.XViD-PUKKA

I can personally confirm that that particular torrent is the real thing, with excellent quality video (for a TS), also audio is not too bad (after first 10 mins or so anyway)

DigitalGuy, you need a utility to extract the files from the two .rar files.  It will find the subsequent parts (.r00 etc)automatically.  On windows the most common app to use is winrar, and they have a (command line only) port for the mac on their site http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm

However you may want to google for mac rar extractors as there may be better progs available from other sources."
,Wrixer,2006-11-24T08:43Z,Fungerar filmen och finns det SWE sub?

,blissfully,2006-11-25T00:17Z,"why does it show 0 downloads if all of you downloaded it and are writing such rave reviews of this torrent? I downloaded one from loder, but audio isn't all that great. In any case for all you true seeders out there.THANKS."

,mummonmarkka,2006-11-26T09:57Z,Digital_Guy: You can unpack the rar-file with Stuffit. Stuffit is freeware.

,BlizzaN1,2006-12-02T12:33Z,Är det SVNESK TEXT på den?
,morusss,2006-12-02T15:38Z,the quality is ok but the sound is really not good. in fact it makes it hardly watchable.
,diaaelsayed,2006-12-02T16:52Z,"ok. I am a new user of the torrents and the movie files...

if I need a video CD copy of the movie, what should I be looking for TERMINOLOGY wise"
,rounder,2006-12-05T12:23Z,Jimmy202 and others stuck att 99.8% even where there are seeders. In this case one of the downloaded files are most probably corrupt. Stop Your client. Delete only the file that's stuck att 99.8%. Start the client again and a fresh copy of the corrupt file will be downloaded.
,becki_bunny07,2006-12-05T15:06Z,"Please help????

Have downloaded this file using bitcomet, but m not sure how to convert it, view on pc, or to burn to a dvd?? I am a first timer, so any help would be appreciated.

Thanks"
,ahs4y,2007-01-07T08:31Z,Ehksellent! Thanks a lot dude!
,sabkabox,2007-01-09T09:07Z,"Absolutely the very worst rip i've downloaded, ever! The audio vocals were too low while the music and gunshots were way too loud for my ears and made listening to the dialog a right royal pain! I tried it on mplayer and VLC. It sounded a wee bit better on VLC. I actually, just created this account and logged in, just so that i could post this comment!!"
