,obiwanbill,2006-11-23T00:52Z,"@ 75% = means the target quality when I encoded from DVDRip to XviD was 75%. 

I didn't compress the credits on this one, but it is just my second uploaded torrent. I will compress the credits on all future ones.

If you are wondering whether it will fit on 2 x CD's, I didn't check. But HD space is about the same price as blank CD's (or sometimes cheaper?), so I figure people don't care.  If this isn't the case, your feedback is welcome.

,obiwanbill,2006-11-23T01:25Z,"DVDR, I think it's short for DVDRip. 
I am new at this too and I didn't post the original Telesync Torrent, so I can't say for sure, but that's what I think he meant.

,daqck,2006-11-23T01:28Z,"they seem to think it means dvd rip, how wrong can that be.
this IS the wrong category
I have TPB set to DVD's not xvid's"
,daqck,2006-11-23T01:30Z,"wot i tell ya ,lol"
,obiwanbill,2006-11-23T01:36Z,"Oh, 

Regarding this torrent being posted in the 
""TYPE: Movies DVDR"" (category) here on TPB (The Pirate Bay).
Yes, I think you are right. I should have posted this XviD in the ""Type: Movies"" (category).

My mistake, I will do better next time. Thanks for pointing out my error.

He can feel the force!

Thank´s mate. I think you did a damn
Good Job!!!!"
,eb#1,2006-11-23T07:14Z,"Well, hmm... no... if you post a DVD-ROM here then you are definitely in the wrong catergory. DVD-ROM is a computer formatted, non writable DVD. DVDR stands for DVD Recordable and is in this case supposed to have the DVD Video format."
,codered,2006-11-23T09:09Z,people who complain on any upload/uploader is handicaped in some way in the head..they are so stupid and retarded ....

,jomax,2006-11-23T14:49Z,"Well the sound is ok but I can´t get any picture.
Nice try!"
,whigga24,2006-11-23T14:58Z,"posted in the wrong category or not, this is (again) the same stuff as al the others out there which are all related to pukka's release (descent quality especially so early after theatre premiere, I rate it 7/10) 

You can unrar, iso-ing, convert, fit to dvd, shrink, whatever you want, but it won't change a thing to the original. As a matter of fact, it will probably only do damage to the original file.

Fuck those who upload stuff presenting it as being brand new, original and their own, while they are just re-posting other peoples stuff and don't add anything new to it. (Not this dude though, who explained himself)
There's is tons of release like this already out there, so change is you probably already downloaded it with a different title, like I did.

Anyway, respect for the uploader, doesn't matter where you post your shit to me, but try to post original stuff that people are looking for, old classics, new releases, doesn't matter, as long as quality matters!!"
,jomax,2006-11-23T15:10Z,I run it in DVD Santa and burned it but no picture! Anybody who got it?
,aztekkrille,2006-11-23T18:27Z,"IDIOTS!

GO TO THE THEATER, THIS SHOULD BE SEEN WITH PERFECT QUALITY!!!
