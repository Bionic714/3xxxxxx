Let God be our love and our fear, and nothing in this world shall have us enslaved.

We cannot be held responsible for what their governments and media constantly do to malign us (noticing the reactions that have been bred into societies by the simple word 'jihad' that their outlets continuously repeat to them as if their people are no less than sheep, and we know from having been under horrible governments ourselves), but we can certainly do our best to live our life on our own terms, and the beauty will prevail.

Peace be to the righteous."
