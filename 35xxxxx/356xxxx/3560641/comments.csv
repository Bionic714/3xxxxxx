,rrodger99,2006-11-20T00:47Z,".ccd file should lead to the image in clonecd.

You can open the .img file with Daemon tools.

It is possible that there is a path in the .ccd or .sub or .cue that the original uploader had & it's not corresponding to the path to the .img file that you have.

In order to analyze this in depth...I think you should upload this immediately."
