,derekbos,2007-01-07T03:34Z,The password is GANGSTA
,LastRogue,2007-04-23T23:30Z,"So tell me... does any one know why the Fuck people put fucking passwords on this shit? I mean I know beggars can't be choosers and all that, but come on! No offense cr9, I appreciate the upload and all, but why the password if your sharing with the whole world???"
,LastRogue,2007-04-23T23:32Z,"correction: ""no offense *detenation*"", not cr9, why the password?"
,snekd,2007-05-24T12:28Z,"so, can i open this if i dl it....whats the passw"
,karlssonfelix,2007-06-19T20:47Z,"there is no .rar
there is no password"
,oriadeal,2007-07-02T22:31Z,"I agree with u LastRogue. I come across this more and more often these days.
I do not understand the reasoning in putting a password on a file open to download by anybody. I think its a bad idea not to mention a little daft. If you're gonna password protect a file, then don't bother seeding it if u feel so strongly about security, Afterall isn't that what passwords are for? 
If there is a legitimate reason for the passwords then accept my apologies, however i doubt that very much. Cheers cr9 - way to go matey!! ;@"
,aicer,2007-07-26T13:48Z,"I DELETED THE WHOLE SHIT, FUCKIN CUNT...
I don't bother downloading things from here if I have to register on your gd site, like hell I'm giving you my name and e-mail adress so you can spam me with mails only you looser are interested in, you fuck...
Go put a blockbuster in your ass and set it on fire..."
,Fredkeith0,2007-07-27T08:14Z,"ignore the comments talking about a password, I believe they simply do not want you to download the files, as there is no rar file, there cannot be a password for the mp3s."
,tomkohanski,2007-08-22T17:01Z,"No RAR, No password needed.  Are people getting that stupid? Files all play good, no tricks. I got it, I seen the make big money at home on your computer TV ads, must be the RIAA is hiring and this is what they are doing."
,badenser,2007-09-30T23:25Z,"Pretty difficult to put a password on .mp3-Files :)
So there is NO PASSWORD
WORKS GREAT"
,Mezmorize,2007-11-11T07:39Z,"great job
