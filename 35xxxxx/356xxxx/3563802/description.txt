Suburbia (1984)

Cult punk movie

Ripped from original PAL retail disc with no compression. There are no extras or subtitles on the original DVD so there are none on the iso. Sorry!

I loved this film when I was growing up and it deserves to be better known. Some of the acting is a bit questionable but the film is very watchable none the less.

Enjoy!
