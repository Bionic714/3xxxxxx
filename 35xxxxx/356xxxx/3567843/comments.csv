,ex_penumbrae,2008-01-08T11:08Z,"Good to see this uploaded, shame the quality is pretty poor. Only worth downloading if you're *really* keen, as there are lots of artefacts in the video. Can't anyone upload a top quality rip?"
,raljack,2008-07-14T14:53Z,This doesn't have any narration.
,raljack,2008-07-14T15:10Z,"Actually nevermind, it's fine."

,A.B.,2011-06-14T19:16Z,The retard that ripped this forgot to deinterlace the video.
,A.B.,2011-06-14T19:35Z,The quality of this rip is extremely bad. Try one of the others.
