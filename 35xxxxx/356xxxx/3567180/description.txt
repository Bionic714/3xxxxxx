Wizardry Gold - Although Wizardry Archives has been around for awhile, the actual Wizardry Gold game plays alot smoother and is more fun.  This is an old-school roleplaying game.  You create a Party of up to 6 members, choosing from 11 races and 14 character classes.  The Party remains with you through the entirety of the adventure.  No party-NPCs.  It is a 2-Dimensional engine, not the fancy 3-D Engine of today.  However, the world-size is immense, alot larger than any game I know of.  You will be lost for hours playing this game, definitely the best RPG ever created in 2-D.
