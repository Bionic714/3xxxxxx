Mass - Labour of Love, 1981 (4AD) (Post Rema-Rema Pre Wolfgang Press)

Mass' one and only studio album, Labour of Love, is extremely creepy. 

Hardly any light escapes from this dingy slab, and if it does, the dark 

shadows cast by the haunting atmosphere and brooding basslines are 

always lurking behind. Beginning with lengthy opener "Mass," Labour of 

Love delves deeper into the churning post-punk that Joy Division left 

open in Closer.
