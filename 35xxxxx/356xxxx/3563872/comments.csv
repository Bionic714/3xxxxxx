Wow. I know that Muslim scholars claim that the Bible, Torah & all have been systematically corrupted to remove all references to Muhammad, Mecca, Allah etc. - a position contradicted by all historical evidence we have.

Still, the amount of twisting that Islam needs to do in order to make the Bible predict Muhammad is amazing. Look at the amount of words needed to change the story from its original intent and purpose!

I find it quite telling that Islam needs to do stuff like this to legitimize Muhammad. Islamic scholars must be seriously worried about the quality of their existing evidence when they need to do this."
