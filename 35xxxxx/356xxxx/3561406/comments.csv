Trojan win32.Small.js

 Zusha worm (both A and B variants) were found on September 8th, 2004. Zusha is a network worm that spreads using LSASS (MS04-011) exploit. It also downloads and runs additional files from Internet. These files are downloaders, they can also kill firewall application processes in memory and modify Windows firewall configuration to bypass the built-in firewall. In addition a backdoor component is dropped and activated on infected systems."
