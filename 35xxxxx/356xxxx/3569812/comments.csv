It should work online without any modifications at all. UT has no cd-key verification as far as i know."
,Llnknown,2006-12-28T16:15Z,"why is it in a .exe and not in a .rar? and why is the folder named ""Unreal Tournement"", and not ""Unreal Tournament GOTY""? is this the 1'st Unreal Tournament game, cus the file size is the exactly same. 
hmmm..."
,Llnknown,2006-12-28T16:16Z,"oh, now i know. its just the demo .exe file?"

Clever way to try and sneak malware/viruses into people's systems. I'd encourage everyone to scan with AV/anti-spyware apps if you extracted data from this file. Some bullshit came out of it trying to replace or mimic the windows debugger among a few other things. Classy."

,Crozier21,2008-05-22T23:27Z,I have installed this game I have a problem with it I have a really fast computer but when I play this game it runs in slow motion. This has puzzled me because I thought it could be a fault with my computer I ran unreal tournament 3 and my other new games and they work perfectly. Does any1 know what the problem could be? thanks

,Raven1992,2008-05-31T16:06Z,Please tell me how to get this working. What happens is that when I try to run setup it tells me some 16bit ms-dos subsystem error and complains about some nerdy stuff. I can't get this freaking working and it's really cheesing me off. The demo worked fine. I copied the files from disc to comp then tried to run setup or UNREALTOURNAMENT and it still wouldnt work for me. can someone PLEASE help me!!!
,OzzyOzawa,2008-06-11T02:28Z,"what is a ""NO delta patch""????"
,ThargorTheGreat,2008-07-08T06:28Z,"RE: Isse with Game running too slow or too fast.

Just launch the executable in Win98 compatability mode and the game works fine.

You can set this in the properties of the unrealtournament.exe file."
,nathanielneall,2008-08-20T09:19Z,"to clear up people having trouble running UT:

you need not run setup.exe that's for uninstaling

all you have to do is extract using winzip self-extractor(double click) and run unrealtournament.exe from where you extracted system folder to"
,nathanielneall,2008-08-20T09:21Z,"also for those of whom the game runs slow
try changing the rendering method
(openGL, software rendering, etc, whatever you have)"
,only99c,2008-08-25T22:23Z,"a Dual Core CPU patch may be needed if the game is slowing down, just a thought my download isn't finished and I have a AMD X2 so I'll find out soon.

If it does slow down under the task manager set the process's affinity to CPU1 or CPU0, just uncheck on of the two so that it will only use 1 cpu."
,cazpotato,2008-08-27T10:37Z,"This torrent works fine for me. I download it and link to anyone who wants to play. Never had any problems with it.  You just unpack and play, it couldn't be any simpler... the only problem I have ever noticed is that because you don't have to install it, Windows doesn't recognize .umod files.  You can get around this by googling "".umod extractor"" and downloading it, then just unpacking .umod files into your Unreal Tournament folder.

Another problem I had is that the editor won't load new textures or sounds, etc. I'm still working on this...

If you're just looking to play, however, it's fine."

,lysergamideman,2008-12-18T17:33Z,Omg !! Why is this taking Soooo long to unzip?? I have been trying to open the self extracting archive & it has been going for almost 45 mins WTF??
,m00kz,2008-12-30T21:47Z,"Works fine. The standard video driver it's running on slows it down a bit, but just download the enhanced OpenGL drivers for UT and it should run perfectly.

Made my first map with this torrent lolz"
,m00kz,2008-12-30T21:51Z,"Also, yeah it will take a little while to extract, took me about 30 minutes to an hour, but just turn everything else off. Once it extracts, everything's where it should be, and works fine."
,quiveri,2009-01-15T08:41Z,Works flawlessly! Many thanks!

,greatsunrise,2009-02-17T01:57Z,"Great upload. the directions of how to use the torrent is contained in file. all you have to do is decompress, which took me only 7 minutes. the game contained is the full game, not a demo like some comments say. the file contains no virus and is compressed a ton. the game works fine but for noobs maybe decrease mouse sensitivity. thanks lordfabius."

,sixshotsix,2009-06-14T06:13Z,"I had that same problem halo_chik press the windows key on your comp and close down UT with task manager.  

When you start the game again it should ask to select your 3d device go to view all and select open gl.  For some reason my 6800 ultra doesn't like the direct 3d unless I run 16 bit in game.

Thanks for uploading this kick ass torrent.  Works great no problems.

K0rfain, at the time it was released, it was just called ""Unreal Tournament"", but after the newer versions of it were released, people started referring to the first version as ""GOTY"" (which stands for Game Of The Year, since it was the Game of the Year for that year).
