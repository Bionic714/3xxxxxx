,yayeyayeyayeyaye,2007-02-06T21:23Z,Has anyone got this to work? Just crashes on execution for me.
,KayDee28,2007-02-19T00:48Z,"Installs fine, standalone works fine only problem is it's missing files. It should contain 30+ Kits (Drums and percussion kits) but it only has the Demo version or main kits hence the size!"
,Marcel_Farewell,2007-08-12T05:24Z,Could someone please upload the whole library for battery 3? I cant find it anywhere.
,artytorrent,2007-10-11T21:48Z,"Crashed with FL Studio 7, and Acid 6 refused to boot up with it installed.
Has installed a few demo kits and WAVs of individual hits, so I could load them into another drum sampler, but I really wanted the VSTi to work itself. Unfortunately the kits are in kt3 format, so won't load in Fruity's Direct Wave (which can read Battery Kt1 and Kt2 files). Will probably work in Kontakt, if I can find my copy of that somewhere...."
,poultry19,2007-11-22T04:00Z,hey when i open this it makes a buzzing noise what is with that. i have tons of other audio program too. how do i fix it.
,baph0met,2007-12-07T20:48Z,where is the crack? i downloaded Komplete 4 and battery 3 is the only program that wont work as a full version. it says here taht the crack works as long as u dont install the software service stuff...but there is no crack..at least i cant find it :P
,SHOC_DOC,2008-01-14T12:10Z,doesn't work after installing battery3.exe error
,endotherm,2008-01-27T21:00Z,battery is supposed to be 12 gigs.... so this is missing files... alot
,pressduck,2008-01-28T16:38Z,"OK, people, you need to read NFO before you start whining about not working etc. This works perfectly and here's the link to the first DVD ISO of the Battery 3 Library http://thepiratebay.org/tor/4000410/Native_Instruments_Battery_3_Library_DVD_1_of_2_ISO

Part 2 of 2 is coming soon."
,drax12,2008-02-05T16:30Z,"Thanks for d/l.  Standalone doesn't work for me but I don't need it anyway.  Only problem is that key ranges don't save.
XP, Cubase3"
,drax12,2008-03-02T17:15Z,"Since I downloaded this; When I close Cubase3 I get a ""memory could not be written"" error.  I'm thinking it's the key-ranges not saving. Anyone with a similar issue?"
,zimonzimon,2008-04-25T20:02Z,"does this work on a mac? I mean as an AU Plug in, or even standalone on OSX"
,audioengineer,2008-04-27T22:14Z,"Alright, If you have downloaded this torrent and actually got it to work please reply with OS specs and the program you are using it with (if you are using the plugin).

Every NI torrent crashes on launch ( [program name] has encountered a problem and needs to close) - and I am not the only one experiencing this (it seems at least 1/2 of the torrent users are). I have tried all of XP pro's (sp2) compatibility modes, and lots of other things. The only torrent the works is kontakt 1, and I would love to be able to use these Battery 3 libraries. 

What programs can you guys use with the NI libs  since kontakt and battery crash?"
,audioengineer,2008-04-27T22:20Z,"BTW:

In addition to the stand-alone apps not running, the NI VSTs cause Ableton, Cubase, and Acid to crash."
,drax12,2008-06-19T10:36Z,"Audioengineer- all  NI VSTs work fine for me but they each have little bugs. As I wrote above Battery3 key ranges won't save and Absynthe4 can't save new programs without a restart of Cubase. Standalone doesn't work for either. Kontakt2 works (even standalone) but sometimes if i get a loop going back and forth it gets stuck and keeps looping even when I've closed my host.
Cheers.

,dorkwithagun567,2008-06-22T04:50Z,"First off, you freaking MORON, there IS NO option in   the setup to install the NI SERVICE pack. so why would anyone worry over installing it? second, this piece of shit doesnt work. it wont work it wont work, dont waste your time with this pile of garbage. it crashes your host. for the record i do not have the service pack on my pc, and this still will not work. instead of buying this program maybe some of your should go buy some brains."
,dorkwithagun567,2008-06-22T04:52Z,PS. stop wasteing peoples time with shitty uploads
,drax12,2008-06-25T22:01Z,"More than 2000 people have downloaded this (torrentportal) and there's only 9 real complaints on this site.
Thanks for the upload chipxsd.  
Let's all put our guns away."

,checkmate444,2008-08-29T19:36Z,"Hey chipxsd;

After going through the trouble to make this torrent available I'm sorry to see that there are a few who obviously don't know what they are doing and choose to take it out on you.
For the record: This is a fine app. and works very well. 

Thank you.

,mrskittlez,2008-10-31T07:47Z,"does not work will not work even if u put libary in it. no one is dissin u or being an ass jus a waste of fucking time and hard drive space even if i can delete it. dis is crap. if u dont heed my words, pull it up standalone or vst. and twice click the battery log, a box pops up, no serial#. no crack is needed. i have gotten this same crap 5 times or more in and uninstall maybe 15 times. changing files and all still nada. i have the complete libary install it and,........A BIG FAT NOTHING!!!!!!!!!! CRAP I TELL U!!!!!!!!!!"
,mrskittlez,2008-10-31T08:02Z,I TAKE WHAT I SAID BACK HAVE NOT TRIED DIS YET BUT I DID HAVE AN AMPLIFY. BUT NOT DIS VERISION. WILL TRY N LET DA WORLD KNOW.
,xbauerx,2008-11-05T23:28Z,"It's works PERFECT for me, with Cubase SX3 on a Athlon64 3000+ 1Gb RAM.
Crashed on the first run, reboot and works fine.
Only works with the first library (sample library), if you want to use others, you should download it on other torrents."
,graham83,2008-11-28T19:49Z,standalone excellent but i only have test version on the vsti in cubase sx3 so 30 min and stop.
,gotosleep,2008-12-10T04:21Z,yeah this works fine with SX 2 and windows visstake!!
,MuchoMalo,2009-01-04T09:32Z,"downloading at 300 kb's, 5 minutes max!

fuck yeh, thanks bitch"
,arrond_wolf,2009-03-20T07:44Z,"I don't know what anyone who says Battery doesn't work is talking (typing) about. I know that it doesn't come w/ the entire Battery 3 library, but any other samples [*.wav,*.aif, ect.] can be applied to trigger via an external MIDI trigger. "
,Prnostrstk78,2010-02-10T02:45Z,"The library didn't load for me as well. I may be an idiot, but what good is program this without 90% of the library? Import your own .wav files and trigger that way? Someone please provide some insight. "
,sketchy7887,2010-11-10T00:31Z,"Hi, I've downloaded this and works fine as standalone but for some reason I cant get it up in Cubase 5. It just doesn't appear in the VST section. Could someone please help because this is an amazing toy and I need to get using it. : ) "
,yo9mama6,2010-12-29T06:26Z,"Okay first install failed to ABELTON Suite 8.1

Upon install the destination for VST's plug in folder/destination was SONAR CAKEWALK. I it ABELTON...hmm.. lemm see if I can use it in ABELTON...Thanx for the UL!!!"
,yo9mama6,2010-12-29T06:27Z,okay that Still did not work...plz tell me why i can not use this with ABELTON LIVE???
,zhennessy,2011-01-24T08:20Z,It works for me too except it doesnt have all the kits 
,notaretardedperson,2011-01-30T01:20Z,"try before you buy... so try it with the sample library, and if you like it, buy it and get the other presets. I've never seen a group of people go this crazy about presets not working. IT'S A FUCKING DRUM SAMPLER, YOU DON'T NEED PRESETS, YOU NEED SAMPLES, AND YOU CAN MAKE YOUR OWN. Do you really need someone else's presets to decide which kick/snare combo sounds best in YOUR song? If you do, then maybe you should be doing something else with your time. If you can't decide for yourself what hats sound good with a certain kick, your doomed from the start...

By the way, thanks uploader."
,citizen9,2011-02-17T18:25Z,"I downloaded, unrar'd, installed, restarted and still wont open standalone. Delete"
,doug360,2011-05-14T01:54Z,"@notaretardedperson I totally agree, I already have the full Battery Library. I was just doing a reinstall cuz it's been acting funny and can't find the installation app. Anyway I've literally never used the sounds that come in the kits they have cuz frankly the suck unless your making Rock,  or Metal you'll be disappointed if you think its  for sounds. You want Battery to 1. add your own sounds 2. Layer sounds and trigger velocity layers 3. Tweak sounds using its built in compressor, reverb, delay and all kinds of different envelopes to make them sound  the way you want them instead of hunting for a certain snare or kick, you can CREATE IT."
,doug360,2011-05-14T02:33Z,"Okay I tried it out and it works perfectly and if you say it doesn't work for you, well then all I have to say is that my computer is not any smarter than yours is...... It  downloaded in about 2 mins and I installed in about 5 mins at most. I had the full Battery Library installed already although I've never use them cuz frankly most of the drums in it are useless to me. Just make when installing to point Battery's VST file to your vstplugin folder and make sure your daw is scanning that folder and if it doesn't show up every daw has a way to rescan the vst folder for new plugins, read the manual. There is no Standalone in this Crack but who needs one anyway? Thanks Uploader great torrent! "
,doug360,2011-05-14T02:44Z,Correction to the above post a Sandalone version is included but I would never use it.
,JigabooJones,2011-07-22T03:53Z,"To everyone wondering where the hell is the library, follow these steps:
click the 'back' button in your browser
arrange torrents by 'seeds'
library torrent is directly below this torrent. cmon people, a little initiative?"
,nicholkid,2011-10-10T17:37Z,@doug360   You make it sound so easy... I have done all those things. It does not work. You probably assume I did something wrong but I assure I did not.
,Barncore,2012-02-01T06:06Z,Anybody know where to find the mac version??
,raknjak,2012-07-29T17:19Z,"Regarding the VST not working in Ableton (not responding error): I had to RENAME it from
Battery 3.dll
to
Battery3.dll
NO SPACES IN VST NAMES APPARENTLY"
