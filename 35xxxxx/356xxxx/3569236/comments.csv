,SaabIkka,2007-07-03T21:00Z,"I installed it and everything, but when I want to play it a pop-up appears ""please insert Diablo II: Lord Of Destruction play disk"".

What should I do???"
,Sup3rkirby,2007-09-15T00:25Z,"This gets old....

THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A DIABLO 2 KEYGEN!

Everyone please make note of this. It is impossible to have keygens for programs like this because the key must be created by blizzard. If the key is not in their database, it won't work really.

These keygens people make are just programs that cycle through a list of keys.  Look carefully and you will see that you get the same keys more than once.

And the keys that this keygen uses are banned by blizzard anyway, so if you try to play online you will get a message saying your key was banned.

Also, please note that you can only have one key online at a time, so if someone else is using your valid key online, you can't log in."
