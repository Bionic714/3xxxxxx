,AZMovieFan,2011-01-05T23:11Z,"I downloaded this.  It's in French, with no subtitles as far as I can see.  I am trying to view it with Windows Media Player.  It plays fine, but no subtitles.  Even when I select the option in WMP to ""show subtitles, if available"" -- nothing.

Any suggestions?  Thanks."
