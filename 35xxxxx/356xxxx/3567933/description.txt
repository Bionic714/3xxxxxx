THE DESTROYED ROOM: B-sides and Rarities, a band-chosen collection of
near-hidden Sonic Youth gems.
The album brings together tracks from throughout the band's career - 
focusing on
tracks previously available only on vinyl, limited-release compilations, or as
b-sides to international singles. Remastered here for the first time, it's a
chance for fans to complete their Sonic Youth collection with pristine versions
of tracks they'd been going nuts trying to find on their own. They asked for
it... and now they're getting it.
