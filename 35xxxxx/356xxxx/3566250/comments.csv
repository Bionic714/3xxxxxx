,hentooth,2006-11-28T18:21Z,"Odd, the rip runs right to the end here, maybe the torrent is broken? Any ideas?"

If it comes to it, I'll re-rip it to a VCD and re-upload it :)"
,ipoften,2006-12-02T16:23Z,definately short. Checked it with gspot. Also audio is uncompressed PCM takes up 80% of the file. any chance of the bit 65 min to the end ? TKS
,hentooth,2006-12-02T17:17Z,"Yup, I'll try to rip the last 20-30 mins and upload it 4U... "
,hentooth,2006-12-02T18:44Z,"I just spliced off everything after 59 mins, and uploaded it here http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3569353
