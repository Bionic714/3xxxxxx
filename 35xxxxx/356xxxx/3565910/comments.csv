,Doggard,2006-12-02T04:42Z,Once I download I will Keep Seeding and SuperSeed If I Can..... I will not let this Go away for good..... Only series that was better was Doctor Who
,Holger Linstrรถm,2006-12-09T19:58Z,"Yes Doggard. Best parts of Dr Who can be found
by browsing torrents with http://torrentscan.com

Be careful with scam sites like torrentsearch.com, they will fill your computer with spyware, adware and popups."

,Noradia,2008-02-02T11:29Z,"The story of Blake's 7 continues in a novel titled ""Afterlife"" by Tony Attwood. It picks up where Season 4 left off. You may have to search for this online. I found a copy here in New York on a used book store."
,Gelu92,2008-05-18T14:36Z,"Hi ddickie,

I was looking for this for my father for a long time, I'm very very glad that you have a torrent for this.

But I'm having some issues, the download is at  73.0% and every time it says(translated from Dutch)->Error: the proces couldn 't get acces to the file because its used by an other proces.
Also, if I take a look at the logger it says->Error opening ""location of the file"" Cygnus Alpha.avi .
I have to start the download over and over again every 1-2 minutes or less. I'm seeding as much as I can(60kb/s)

I would really appreciate your help, thanks a lot."
,Gelu92,2008-05-22T20:19Z,"*Fixed
Download is finished now. Thanks a lot ddickie!"
,comandanteloof,2008-08-30T15:59Z,"this is great! thanks ddickie. 

Are there any more seeders? I've been d/l ing for about 5 days now and no further than 12.7% - it's telling me its going to take nother 20 days to get it all!!!


any seeders please? 

I will reciprocate!"
,petra1964,2008-09-13T23:47Z,thanks
,BerugasLabor,2008-10-07T21:58Z,thanks for making me discover this series through this torrent. problem is however that the video/audio quality is so poor here that i cant recommend anyone download this when there are so many other blake7 torrents available out there in a lot higher quality. well thanx none the less :p
,Stormson,2008-10-12T00:45Z,"I dled the first few episodes and they were watchable, but the audio wasn't all there. Thanks for the upload, though. I watched the reruns of this show on PBS stations.
BerugasLabor, on what other websites can we find Blake's 7? Can you please post them."
,BerugasLabor,2008-12-01T19:35Z,"Stormson: mininova has the first two seasons last i checked, and in top notch quality :)"
,petzar,2010-02-04T10:55Z,"If this is the same torrent I downloaded, and I believe that it is because it appears to be the only torrent of all four seasons, I got a beef. I appreciate the efforts of the uploader but episodes 27 and 39 are ABSENT! It is like some sort of sick joke because these episodes are the two most pivotal in the whole show. Somebody correct me please if I am mistaken. "
,petzar,2010-02-17T11:07Z,I can admit when I am wrong. The missing episodes are just very poorly organized to the front of the folder. My bad for missing them. Thank you uploader for a great series.
