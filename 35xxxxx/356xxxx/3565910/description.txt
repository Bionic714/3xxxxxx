Blake's 7 was a British science fiction television series made by the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) for their BBC 1 channel. Created by Terry Nation, a prolific television writer best known for creating the popular Dalek monsters for the television series Doctor Who, it ran for four seasons between 1978 and 1981.

Popular from the time it was first broadcast, it remains well-regarded on account of its dark tone, moral ambiguity and strong characterisation. It is often remembered for the shock ending that concluded the series.

This download is all four seasons, highly compressed so the quality is OK but nothing special. That's how 4 complete seasons fits into 6.5GB. Note the sound is mono only, carried in the left channel, you will need to cater for this when playing back.
