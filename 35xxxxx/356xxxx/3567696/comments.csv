do you have shit for brains? were do you see in this upload ""full season""? PRISON BREAK is on season2 so i have to tell people these episodes are season2 episodes. why the fuck would anyone upload a TV show and not post what season the episodes are? PRISON BREAK season 2 is not done yet so how the fuck could this be the full season2? "

one question... how about season 1? please "
,8.32,2007-04-01T21:53Z,"I played the VOB files with VLC, and first files were no problem. However the VTS_01_3.VOB file, in the Video TS file from ep 1 to 5, won't play correctly. It will start and playback 2 seconds of video and then jump 15 seconds or so further and play another 2 seconds etc etc. Same for the rest of the VOB files of ep 1 to 12...
Am I doing something wrong? It seems that the files are corrupted. Do I need to burn them on a DVD?? Please help"
