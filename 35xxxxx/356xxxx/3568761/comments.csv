,blankbox,2006-12-01T22:05Z,"...and now for those of you wondering about the slow upload...

1) This is over-night delivery....usually pay extra for that...so don't bitch.
2) Sending fat bits.....they run slower..
3) ISP is a useless P-O-S ...so phone him...and tell HIM he's interfering with Internet Commerce
4) Blame rrodger. - he wanted a 750mb file from me - so this is a TEST ....only a TEST
5) Keeps all the kiddies around till everybody gets the whole pie...hehe

Now...if your still with me after reading thru all that B.S. and foo-fer-ah then nows the time to GET A LIFE...cozy up to the missus....the girlfriend....or whoever....cauze it's gonna be a long cold night

ciao"

,rrodger99,2006-12-02T21:40Z,"That wasn't too bad....I got this in about a day.

I have tried & tried to get the England VFR from emule with no success at all. I got 229mb & now nobody has the full file.

I will take the slow upload over that any day."
