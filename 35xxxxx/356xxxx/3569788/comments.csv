[V],Kefissos,2006-12-03T12:33Z,"Guys: I forgot to write its include covers with some albums and ""Extra"" is a movie of Pixies."
[V],Kefissos,2006-12-03T17:17Z,"Sorry, Glazer and other leechers...I'm uploading the torrent and had to restart my computer. I'll tjeck the uploading now and then."
[V],Kefissos,2006-12-08T23:25Z,"Folks, listen! You HAVE to SEED, when my upload are finish...Are you really so selfish? If you won't, I can't upload ANY great music anymore."
,Ashley10404,2007-04-18T16:00Z,how do you seed?
,AbstactPlane,2007-04-24T00:32Z,"I think it works where after the download is completed, you leave the bar on the bitorrent bit with the tick there. You do not remove it. Is that right?"
,nubpants,2007-08-15T00:59Z,yeah azureus lets you seed automatically i think
,chfte,2007-08-28T18:17Z,"Most (all?) clients throw the torrent into the seeding column after downloading.  You can just leave it there to seed back.  If you want listen to the music after finishing your download, then stop the torrent first before copying the folder of music to another location on your computer, then restart the torrent.  If you stop the torrent and play the music without copying, you may not be able to seed because the client will say that another application is accessing the files.  If this happens, you can restart your computer and it will seed again (I use Azureus and it will not lose any torrents, even if my computer crashes).  

If you accidentally remove the torrent, just come back to this page and hit the download link.  If the files are in the same place, your client will recognize them and check them before putting them back in the seeding column.  Pixies rule!"
,lordofwar1234,2008-02-07T12:19Z,"I will definitely seed this until my ratio is 2370.00!!! I fucken love the Pixies, thank you Pixies and thank you Kefissos for pirating this great band!"

,marxm,2009-10-15T10:32Z,"@ seeders

It isn't necessary to seed but it sure is polite!  All you have to do is leave your torrent on and do not delete the files or the torrent file.  Most torrent programs seed automatically.  

You don't have to seed every torrent you have either.  If your list gets too long for your bandwidth to handle just check your ratio (it's one of the columns further to the right).  If you have a ratio of 1 or more that means you have uploaded as much as you have downloaded of that file.  I usually seed until I max out bandwidth (or get a call from my isp :D)."
