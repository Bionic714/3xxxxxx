,Mad-Gamer,2010-06-28T18:19Z,"@Karl500.. Hi Karl, thanks for the game.. m a great fan of MS series.. but I need a big help from you.. after downloading the file thru torrent downldr, what shud i do?? Plz help.."
,karl500,2011-07-20T22:38Z,"1.Double-click WinKawaks.
2.In the file menu select 'Load game'
3.In the Load game window click 'Only Available'
4.Click the game you want to play then click 'OK'
I already configured the controls for Logitech RumblePad 2.
If you are using another gamepad or the keyboard,go to the Game menu & select 'Redefine keys'.
Then in the Game menu select 'save key settings as default'

If you are having problems check the faq.
The netplay option enables you to play online.

,karl500,2011-07-20T22:49Z,"It should also work with the Logitech Wireless Gamepad F710 but I haven't tested it yet.
New versions of WinKawaks are available here: http://www.kawaks.net/

You can try MAME also which is open-source.
