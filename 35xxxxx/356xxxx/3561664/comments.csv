,pursuant,2006-11-26T00:53Z,Trying to figugre out the process for the activation code for this. I have a bunch of registrations entries in the rar. Do I just copy and paste to the Kaspersky directory? Not sure help if you can.

Go into the options and find the license part.
Add a new license (browse to the .key) and replace the old one.

Done."
