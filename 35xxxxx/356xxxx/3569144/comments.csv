,loadmeup,2006-12-02T12:17Z,"Great one, thank you!"
,NirreFirre,2007-01-03T21:21Z,Anyone know which the release this is? Anchor Bay?
,DogNo7,2007-05-18T22:54Z,"It was a release that was originally sent to the States.

It was intended for an English speaking audience, but the audio is in German, with Subtitles for those people that read English."
,mocoroco,2007-09-09T07:08Z,"i didn't get any subtitles... nor english, nor spanish"
,DogNo7,2007-09-26T20:59Z,"Subtitles do indeed, exist on this file.

This is a ""real"" divx file, and conforms to the divx standard.  As such, the only player that I have found that allows you to view the subtitles is the divx player from divx.com (available free).

I don't know if/how the xvid codec (open source) deals with divx subtitle tracks.

,stokebloke,2008-06-11T11:23Z,"Couldn't get this file to work with subtitles.
Plays fine without, but as soon as I enable subtitles the picture screws up and becomes unwatchable :-( This was using the latest version of DivX player (6.8.2)  Windows media player and media player classic could also play the file but no access to the subtitles. 
Will have to hunt for another version with working subs."
,bonnie335,2008-08-18T13:35Z,"Download vsfilter. It's a subtitle filter. 
Works fine in my zoom player."
,sashko_lox,2009-01-15T17:07Z,Thank you. a good movie
,bertilbulle,2009-04-19T02:18Z,"Good movie, but really worth getting somewhere else. The subtitles were huge, ugly and missed a lot of dialogue(there's sooo much going on, the subs didn't do it justice at all, but they could have been better than this!). 

To top it all off, they were way too far up, hiding character's lower faces many times. The VSfilter didn't work for me, or was too much work to be worth it."
,DogNo7,2009-12-25T23:11Z,"The subtitles came straight from the region 1 DVD.

I didn't write the subtitles, nor did I write the divx encoder which encodes the subtitles into the output file.

How the subtitles are displayed on your screen is going to depend completely on what player you use to watch this.

Since the subtitles are ""soft"", they are effectively on another layer that you can either turn on, if your player supports it, or you can download subtitles elsewhere and dink around with syncing your downloaded subtitles with the movie.

It is completely up to you on whether you want to use the embedded subtitles or not.

The player I previewed this on was the Divx player (free), and everything looked fine to me."
,darkerix,2010-03-21T20:42Z,"This is the external subtitle from opensubtitles.org that worked for me:

,viglione,2010-05-16T03:24Z,"Awesome movie, thanks!"
,indiaman,2011-01-11T18:14Z,Thanks for this great movie.
,StvnWilsn,2011-09-25T19:18Z,"hey guys, use Daum Potplayer, Media Player Classic (Which comes with Klite Codec Pack), or VLC player. its easy to turn on Subtitles. 
I highly recommend Daum Potplayer. it started where KMplayer stopped.
The Best Video Player hands down Daum Potplayer. 
Has both x86  and x64 bit versions. works get on my Windows 7 Ultimate x64
;)"
