An explaination:
After watching countless of bad movies, documentaries of the weird, skate videos, graffiti videos, accidentally entertaining TV and other moving picture material, Roelewapper has left his beer-stained couch, shoved aside the VHS tapes, DVDs, VCDs and DiVX CDs to make room for one DVD to replace them all: the RETARD-O-TRON VIDEO MIXTAPE! Based on the old phenomenon of the audio cassette mixtape, and the VHS party tape, this DVD is a long series of amazing, bizarre, strange, shocking and otherwise interesting pieces of footage, compiled together in a such a groovy manner it'll make your nipples itch! Originally intended as a guide through the amazing world of videos for subcults and special interest groups, it grew to collection of clips that'll leave ANYONE gasping for air!
