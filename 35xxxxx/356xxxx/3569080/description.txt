                                PLOT OUTLINE:
                                -------------                  
 
IMF agent Ethan Hunt has been sent on a mission to retrieve and destroy 
the supply of a genetically created disease called 'Chimera'. His mission 
is made impossible due to the fact that he is not the only person after 
samples of the disease. He must also contest with a gang of international 
terrorists headed by a turned bad former IMF agent who has already managed 
to steal the cure called 'Bellerophon' and now need 'Chimera' to complete 
their grand plan of infecting the whole world. In order to infiltrate and 
locate the terrorist group he relies on the help of an international thief 
Nyah of whom he quickly develops a love interest. Time is not only running 
out for Agent Hunt to find and destroy 'Chimera' before the terrorists get 
their hands on it, but he must also find 'Bellerophon' so as to save his 
love interest who has already become infected by the disease from a 
terrible and rapid death.
