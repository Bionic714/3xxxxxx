Focus first in 3 or 4 songs like Warriors, Lady In Black, No Pride or the Instrumental Sailing Way To India.
And pay attention this was a release from a little independent label.
Original LPs are sold for very high prices in the internet nowadays.
If people like I will post the second LP (Heroes of The Wasteland)."
