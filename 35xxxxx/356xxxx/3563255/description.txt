This is Tryad's sophomore album Listen. I'm not really sure as to what genre to put it under since that can vary from person to person, so I leave that for you to discover. Best I can say is that it is electronica or maybe light industrial with a lot of other stuff.

If you were a fan of their first album Public Domain which you can get here you'll most likely like this one as well. It's more refined and well made than their first imo. Considering that they are a "virtual" band, where the band members are located all over the world and have managed to do an even better job than before is quite telling.

As before their music is released under a Creative Commons license. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.5/ What this means is that you can share as much as you like or do whatever you wish with it. Nice not to have to deal with any of the Music Mafia's crap right? If you do like them, I would encourage you to buy the album or tracks as I did. You can get it at Amazon, CD Baby (great place for indie stuff). I believe iTunes has it as well, although probably DRM'd. You can also donate at their website.
