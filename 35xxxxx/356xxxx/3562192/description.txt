Scott O?Malley (Bleak Future).Winner of the 2000 No Dance Film Festival award for Best Actress (AmberPhillips) and Best Cinematography, here for the first time ever is the Director?s Cut, edited together from the rough VHS dailies, featuring an all-new soundtrack, and completely different from the anemic and authorless cut made by the film exclusive committee of producers.
