The Gene Machine is a VERY underrated point-and-click adventure game for DOS.

Instructions:
-------------

UnEMC the BIN file before mounting/burning.

The Gene Machine works wonderfully under DOSBox.

Here are the settings -- change the mount points to specify your file architecture:

#BEGINNING

[dosbox]
memsize=63

[cpu]
core=dynamic

[gus]
gus=false

[sdl]
autolock=false
sensitivity=200

[speaker]
disney=false
tandy=off
pcspeaker=false

[dos]
ems=false

[autoexec]
mount c \\\"(INSTALLED LOCATION)\\\"
imgmount d \\\"(INSTALLED LOCATION)GeneM.cue\\\" -t iso
c:
cd \\\\
call GENE.BAT
exit

#EOF

Also...

There is a file in the installed The Gene Machine directory called \\\"GENE.INI\\\". In that file there is a line that says \\\"/DD\\\". Change the END character to the letter of your CD drive, mounted drive, or emulated drive.

Ex: The emulated CD-ROM drive is H, so change it to \\\"/DH\\\".
