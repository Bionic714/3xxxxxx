,punkrawked,2007-06-07T19:38Z,"missing ""All Ages"" but that's kind of a best of album, so maybe it doesn't reaaaaally count. thanks much though, awesome torrent!"
,Someotherdude,2007-06-10T18:02Z,"""No complications included. All songs can be found in the ?proper? albums anyways.""

Hence All Ages is missing ;)"
,CostelloCostigan,2007-07-07T22:50Z,"Once it hits the 75% mark, it moves a little slower, but it's still working toward 100 and doing fine..."
,Someotherdude,2007-07-11T23:33Z,"Their most recent album, New Maps of Hell, is not included in this discography.
You can find it in proper quality (ripped by me) here: http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3739079
Ripped in LAME APX, also known as V0, the highest VBR quality available to mp3"
,BrentonSucks,2007-07-27T18:40Z,"Great torrent! They're all catagorized very nicely, and the album art goes into iTunes automatically!
It didn't take long at all to DL.
Thanks a lot! "
,Someotherdude,2007-08-20T23:57Z,"Would people be interested in an upgraded version of this torrent?

I'm thinking of re-ripping all albums in better quality (except b-sides of course), and adding New Maps of Hell.
What do you think? Worth the trouble?"
