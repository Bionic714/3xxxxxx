,Rethic,2007-07-21T17:34Z,How are you supposed to mount anything with Daemon? :S there are no files that Daemon can use as a virtual cd and therefore it's not possible to bypass the cd/dvd check wich in turn means that you cannot play the game without a cd/dvd
,Rethic,2007-07-21T17:38Z,The crack that comes with the torrent is useless
,Rethic,2007-07-21T18:18Z,If anyone would happen to know HOW to actually get this to start without a cd/dvd then please inform the rest of us? hm?
,Naxon_255,2007-09-02T09:38Z,"open ONE of the files with winrar, extract the file, mount the image you just extracted. install. crack.
if the crack doesn't work then just get another one on gamecopyworld or something."

Did you ever stop to think that if you were to actually HELP newbies work out how to use torrent files, that there would be more torrents and seeders available to all of us?      think about it.......  of course, some of you will now tell me to get f*cked and that i am a piece of sh*t but the laugh I will get reading it will take less effort than it did for you to actually think up the swear words....

,cestnouslotje,2011-08-10T10:52Z,"For everyone who doesn't know how to install a game like this: 
1-unrar the file
2-launch the setup and install
3-open the 'crack' map and drag the .exe file to the location where you installed the game and drop it.
4-the computer will ask you if you want to replace the current .exe file, say yes.
And... you're done!"
