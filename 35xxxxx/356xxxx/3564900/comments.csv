,vivid93,2011-04-16T17:15Z,"@ScarletRunner8 You asshole forgot to upload that torrent.Anyway,today I heard the soundtrack of Medieval II-Total War on youtube and I was like:""I gotta have it in mp3!"".I then searched for it on torrents,this was the only torrent out there that had it.When I saw that there are no seeders i said WTF!
In a last hope to get this and Angela & Jeff van Dyck track entitled ""We are all one"" I googled one more and stumbled upon Jeff's website.What is to see there,you think?All of his games soundtracks HAHA!
