,mikib,2006-11-22T20:48Z,Excellent film! Thanks!
,Temptation,2006-11-22T22:01Z,"Dudesson,

the I version is the IPod version.  I think the description must have gotten cut off because of excessive length.  "
,machbar,2007-02-23T06:18Z,"Yes, there is the standard DIVX version 1.7 gigs, and an ipod version. It's important to me to keep up the quality, so we'll soon be offering the film in parts instead of one 1.76 gb file if that helps. Anyway, the smaller one is an Ipod version. Whichever you download, I hope you get something from the experience and will consider supporting the people who made it possible. Thanks. www.thecoporation.com"
