I will be seeding when online :)"
,Pike84,2011-11-04T06:41Z,"Track #7 is actually ""E8 Boogie"" and #11 ""Rat/P's And Q's"" (can't have slash in the filename, but should be in the tag).

The last three tracks don't belong in this album, and one of them apparently isn't even Squarepusher's. Wikipedia tells that this ""Lost In Space"" tune is actually ""Hungry On Arrival (Spring Heel Jack Remix)"" by Outernational Meltdown. Nice tune tho.

The quality is sub-par even for the time of the upload (CBR @ 128kbps), but I don't mind, since I'm going to buy the original soon :)."
,Anon_0407,2012-01-20T01:20Z,Ugh why doesn't anyone have the 1997 version?
