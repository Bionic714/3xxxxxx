[T],TaurusKJ,2008-09-16T22:26Z,"Install DVD Shrink on your computer, click on open files, select the folder where you downloaded this torrent, and let it do its thing.  Then it will burn it to DVD for you (it likes to use the drivers installed for nero, so if you have nero installed on your computer, you're in like sin! Nero 7 or above).  Get DVD shrink here:

and you will be enjoying the great stoneface of the silent era soon! : )"
