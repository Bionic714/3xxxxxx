Digital Drug CD - Your Experience
---------------------------------
You love the rush of a theme park roller coaster, or the true inner happiness experienced during a rare moment of love.
Why can't these moments happen more often, you think? Why can't the world live like that all the time?

With a "digital drug", you can touch those parts of your mind usually reserved for the momentary peaks of our existence.
This is a totally legal, completely safe, non-addictive binaural beat recording that releases endorphins, the body's natural
"happy pill", to bring about an elevated mood state.

You simply slip on the headphones and relax. You feel soft and cosy. As the noises swish around inside your head, you gain a
total sense of clarity and harmony. Your brain naturally generates and releases endorphins, enkephalins, endogenous opiates, and
serotonin... your mood elevates, pain disappears, fears and anxieties are crushed. You steadily begin to realize your sensitivity
has increased. Suddenly everything looks brighter and more beautiful. Why don't people usually see this? You feel like a famous
movie director, with a very special lens on life.

You're totally conscious with amazing clarity of mind. You feel a sense of euphoria. You close your eyes and can suddenly visualize
anything you dream of. It's truly amazing. And it doesn't just last for your sixty minute session... this is a totally natural
"high on life" digital drug, with the effects lasting for hours afterward... no sudden "drop down", no adverse effects. It's just
a feel-great, total-mind state of happiness, pure and simple.
