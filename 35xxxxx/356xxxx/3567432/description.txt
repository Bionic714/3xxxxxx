"It is undeniably true, that the major media outlets within the United States have had a close working relationship with major US intelligence organizations. This is a fact. In particular with the CIA. We know this has happened. Back in the 1940s, in the 1950s and the 1960s at the very least we know that the CIA for instance cultivated at least 400 mainstream US-journalists - without anyone?s knowledge - to work on behalf of the CIA. And we are talking about people in places like CBSnews, New York Times, Washington Post ? all of the major outlets. Does this mean that the CIA controlled all of the news coming out of the US? No, not necessarily. But does it mean, that they were able to influence the news in critical ways when they needed to? And the answer is clearly ?yes?."
Richard Dolan, Historian

?Well I think they did do some information management, I dont deny that. I think they were concerned that if the public knew that the CIA was involved, that that would panic them even further. So that they tried to limit at least the publics knowledge of CIAs involvement.?
Gerald K. Haines, official historian of the CIA
