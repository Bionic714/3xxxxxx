,Netrodome,2007-08-30T00:46Z,"Riktigt tragisk film, men säkert den sanna verkligheten på thailands gator\nattliv.
Ta till er denna och ta lixom jag avstånd från prostitution och få er en tankeställare av denna filmen.

Mycket Cred till Jordan som gjorde denna filmen."

,haggis01,2008-01-27T12:20Z,"Abstracta : 

I really hope what you are saying is true,where do you get this from ? 

Some forums ,says she is dead,even some guys went to her gfs and asked,some say drug overdose(i am sure she isnt using drugs at all,i work with this and know,her personality and behave ,no drugs)

Maybe those fucking mafia guys was angry after she exploided everything from that street ,bar on tele,dunno.... 

What is wrong with this fucking english guy,wanna punch him so hard,what a loser,damn  !

Feel so sorry for this  girl,so i hope ABSTRACTA,that you can confirm this please ....."

I bet there are a alot of girls like ger in bangkok.
I wish I could help them ! :("
,mightymike-bonaire,2008-08-29T14:41Z,If this girl (Pla) should be dead....Jordan Clark murdered her.... he`s a fuckin` creep and he put it all on tape for the world to see.
