,Const2k,2007-01-18T23:45Z,"Thanks, floa - quite a nice collection... I hope they'll live long. Here's one more of such collections: http://www.stoptazmo.com/ah_my_goddess/
Both of them have files from KAA release, so, if you want old scans, you can get 'em there. But newer (and better) re-release by GMT is inside this torrent.
C'mon, guys... Are you really going to comment once per month? ;)"

,CrankyBird,2008-09-27T11:12Z,"Thanks Const2k this is Great! 

I'm still downloading but don't see Volume 3.
Is it in this collection? 
If yes, where is it?

Thanks again for all the hard work."
,Const2k,2008-10-17T15:51Z,"CrankyBird, please read description, namely ""2 first AMG: Complete volumes (instead of old vol.1-3)""
""Ah! My Goddess"" turns 20 this year. Several first volumes have been reprinted since 1980's as ""AMG: Complete"" series. Hence I replaced old volumes (from DarkHorse by KAA) with new ones (from Kodansha by GMT). This torrent is quite old already, so check miyaku.com (GMT off.site) for updates."
