Of course it did continue downloading where it last ended."

,kronos_o,2007-06-27T02:35Z,omfg seed you bastids! it's going soooo slow
,ektakrome,2007-07-22T22:52Z,"PLEASE keep on seeding. I'm very interested in seeing these videos. Which can be used for other things including meeting women. 

Discipline, Intention among others."
,ektakrome,2007-07-31T05:09Z,Aparently only one of you actual seeders is giving up any bandwidth. What is wrong with you people. I can see 6 full seeders online and i'm only getting 1.6 kbps ave bitrate. Come on. I don't have half of the files and i've already hit my 1.0 ratio and am uploading at least twice as fast as I am downloading.
,poipoipoi,2007-08-07T22:25Z,"ektachrome, are you bragging about uploading at 3.2k? what a hero!"
,refnaf,2007-08-09T13:16Z,Ive got all of the annihilation method...
,Perfect04,2007-08-22T23:32Z,"It gives me a error saying ""____ contains an invalid path"". Any suggestions could be useful."
,Dawstah,2007-08-28T22:48Z,"refnaf, If u have em al why dont u seed? its like impossible to find Styles DVD 3 and 5"
,nightwahk,2007-08-29T23:27Z,"First, THNX! for seeding this stuff.

Second, from reviewing the comments I do not feel alone in having problem, but xp does not allow me to name maps with quotation marks(i.e. the mystery stuff), so could someone please tell me/us how you get past/solve this. Or maybe someone would be so kind remove the quotation marks from maps and make a whole new torrent with the Mystery content ;D.

....Again, thanx every one for up-ing!"
,Cucco5,2007-08-30T22:55Z,"thx this torrent, it's cool! but can i have some uploaders + ??? thx"
,maxkill,2007-09-13T00:33Z,Ross Jeffries might be gay but he is entertaining =) kind of makes learning easier + he knows how to build the right beliefs and attitude in which isn't a dissadvantage. Mystery is kind of good also it seems from the pickupartist
,madmack,2007-09-14T23:59Z,"Skip the """" in filenames... I think they are f00king it up for people..."
,devilno8,2007-10-01T00:01Z,"i just started downloaded this torrent, I read that people had problems that had to do with the path, if you read closer says that the platform had a problem with the name, maybe your path is too long(at least in mine was) so I changed my path to the c: and that worked. Thank you for posting this torrent."
,DoomedAl,2007-10-05T14:22Z,"Yeah, the paths&filenames in this torrent are really long! You have to download it to a really short directory or directly to the root."
,hbmhbm,2007-10-11T00:05Z,"Tried to download to just C:\....still dosent work...casue of the ""path"".......any other ideas?"
,russian999,2007-10-20T21:52Z,"CAN SOMEONE PLEASE SEED??

Thank You!
I will seed for like 5 days straight once Im done"
,oldwar2012,2007-11-27T22:20Z,To download this cool shit you click DOWNLOAD THIS TORRENT (in green) then when the box pops up with the details don't click okay go to the top where it says path it say C: mystery and whatever delete everything except C: then click okay it might say something else click okay on that too it worked for me
,eskybody,2008-01-30T19:09Z,"Could somebody seed, please! I'm realy eager to see this by the way ;-)"
,kauken,2008-02-07T16:54Z,"HELLO  IM GOING TO USE CAPS AS NOBODY ANSWERS THIS QUESTION. 

THERE IS A BITTORRENT ERROR WHEN TRYING TO DOWNLOAD THIS. SO DONT BULLSHIT US WITH , JUST RENAME THE TORRENT, UPLOAD IT AGAIN OR COME UP WITH A WORKING SOLUTION. TO SOME OF US THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT. MYSTERY IS MY FUCKING HERO AND THIS TORRETN SHOULF BE GREAT - SO JUST HELP OUT WILL YA!"
,Inlinekungen,2008-03-25T19:14Z,please seed
,kayakujutsu,2008-04-22T07:15Z,"To: kauken

Another option other than using capslock is the correctly read the other comments that address the issue.  They did not say to rename the torrent.

Additionally, these reading comprehension skills will be very important long after you figure out how to use your computer and download the torrent - like when you open up the ebook and find that the content isn't all pictures."
,diego1361,2008-07-02T05:24Z,for some reason the neil strauss section is missing the third part. it goes from part 2 to 4. Other than that it's a great upload. VERY EDUCATIONAL
,kyuuhoshi,2008-09-11T02:55Z,"Hey I am downloading parts of this file, but only the Style stuff, and not Mystery. It seems like the """" is fucking up that path... So my question is if there is a way to go around this or am I just fucked?

btw I am gonna seed this for a very long time, and it would be nice for others too if I had all of the files."
,madsyy,2008-11-20T19:51Z,How come part 5 of both aren't in this ??
,clwgator,2008-12-22T22:24Z,What codec do I need to play this? I can hear it but can't see it.
,CnpuHTeP,2009-04-22T06:36Z,Thx 4 seeding guys! Russian pickup'ers (maybe i'm wrong) realy apreciates (maybe i'm wrong here 2)  that! =)
,sigjack215,2009-06-30T00:14Z,I have a problem opening the neil strauss pdfs. does any one else?
,Touchmetal,2010-01-09T08:37Z,"I don't like incomplete torrents...

The mystery method DVD isn't complete...There is no DVD 5 and the DVD 3 is just a part of a bigger set..It just has the kino step...11:01 minute video...

A torrent which has complete rip of Mystery's DVDs is this
