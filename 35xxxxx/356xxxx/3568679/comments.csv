It is very important to always name the performers."
,plasmarifle,2006-12-02T18:43Z,"Sorry, I don't exactly know, who organist is, because I've downloaded this records from our network and then shared them with The Pirate Bay. Maybe you can be interested in my other release - http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3568635 - J.S. Bach organ works, plays Lionel Rogg. It's from my home collection."

,BardoftheOzarks,2007-12-06T05:55Z,OMG! Thank you so much!  Bach is undoubtedly the best composer for the organ.  And thank you for finding out who the organist is.  I always like to keep that noted.
,daveggg,2008-08-02T23:36Z,TON KOOPMAN IS THE BEST ORGANIST IN THE WORLD.
,BardoftheOzarks,2008-08-26T20:53Z,"Well, I don't know about the best.  Personally, I prefer Leonidas Melnikas."
,netrek,2009-12-27T06:28Z,The best organists for Bach were Helmut Walcha and Anton Heiler!
,fabzXII,2010-03-21T02:33Z,"I hate Koopman performance ... :S
My best is Karl Richter but i'm going to try the Helmut Watcha versions ,Cheers upload Bach merit respect :D"
,zoebanks,2012-01-22T16:52Z,"Funny that.

I would have said the best Bach organist was either Simon Preston or Kevin Bowyer."
