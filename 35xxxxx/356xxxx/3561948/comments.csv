Release Notes:

Eminem Presents: The Re-Up (Shady Records/Interscope Records), began as a street
mixtape project--an underground, unofficial CD with raw production
values--designed to help launch new Shady Records artists Stat Quo, Ca$his and
Bobby Creekwater. ""But what happened is that the material was so good and the
tracks were getting produced like a regular album,"" said Eminem. ""Instead of
putting it out there rough and unfinished, I thought we should add some other new
tracks, make it a real album, and put it in the record stores to give these new
artists a real boost."" The album was executive produced by Eminem, who also
produced the majority of the songs. A handful of selections were produced by The
Alchemist, who also compiled the album in true mixtape fashion. The Alchemist is
best known for his work with Cypress Hill, Nas, Snoop Dogg, Mobb Deep, and
Jadakiss.

Each of the tracks makes its official CD debut on Eminem Presents: The Re-Up,
though Stat Quo's ""Billion Bucks,"" and Obie Trice's ""Cry Now"" (Remix), produced
by LT Moe, was recently released on mixtapes and to radio. The first single and
video will be ""You Don't Know"" from Eminem, 50 Cent, Ca$his and Lloyd Banks. With
Eminem and Ca$his from the Shady camp and 50 Cent and Lloyd Banks from G-Unit,
the rap illustrates the unity of the two organizations.

The Re-Up also gave acclaimed hip-hop producer The Alchemist a chance to work
with Shady's new regime. After joining forces on-stage as Eminem's DJ on last
year's Anger Management 3 tour, Alchemist and the Shady camp began collaborating
in the studio. This new album features the results of this anticipated
collaboration with new tracks produced by The Alchemist featuring Stat Quo,
Ca$his, Bobby Creekwater and Obie Trice.

Among the album's other recordings are ""No Apologies"" from Eminem; ""Talkin' All
That"" from Ca$his; ""City Of Gold"" from Bobby Creekwater; ""Murder"" from Bizarre
and Kuniva (both of D12); and The ""Smack That (Remix)"" with Akon.

Stat Quo, hailing from Atlanta, was signed to a joint deal between Shady Records
and Dr. Dre's Aftermath Entertainment after Eminem and Dre heard him on the
Underground Atlanta mixtape series. Creekwater, also from Atlanta, was inked
after Eminem heard his work on demos and in the studio with The Alchemist.
Ca$his, a Chicago native transplanted in his youth to Orange Co., California,
was a member of West Coast underground favorites The Renegadez.
