Release Notes:

Spiritual rockers P.O.D. (a.k.a. Payable On Death) began their rise in the late
'90s with their unique brand of inspiring lyrics and driving metal, hip-hop,
tribal, and reggae influences. With a 14-year career under their belts, P.O.D.
has logged a remarkable array of achievements, including worldwide sales
exceeding 7 million. Supported by their passionate fanbase - known as "The
Warriors" - the band has created what they describe as "a catalog of music that
we want to respect and honor with each step into the future."

Rhino salutes the group's multiplatinum tenure with Atlantic Records with a
single-disc compilation that mixes album tracks with unreleased and hard-to-find
songs. P.O.D. - GREATEST HITS (THE ATLANTIC YEARS) will be available November 21
at all physical retail outlets and at www.rhino.com for a suggested retail price
of $18.98 and at all digital music providers for a suggested retail price of
$11.99.

Featuring 17 songs, the collection includes music originally released between
1999 and 2006. The disc includes a pair of unreleased tracks - "Going In Blind,"
their new single recorded exclusively for this compilation, and "Here We Go," a
session outtake from Testify.

GREATEST HITS (THE ATLANTIC YEARS) contains seven songs featuring the group's
original lineup - singer Sonny Sandoval; guitarist Marcos Curiel; drummer Wuv
Bernardo; and bassist Traa Daniels. The breakout tracks "Southtown," "Rock The
Party (Off The Hook)" and fan favorite "Set Your Eyes To Zion" represent
P.O.D.'s 1999 major-label debut, The Fundamental Elements Of Southtown. The
compilation spotlights four tracks from the band's Top 10 follow-up, Satellite,
including the smash radio hits "Alive," "Boom," and "Youth Of The Nation," a
positive anthem in response to a pair of school shootings that occurred around
P.O.D.'s home turf.

The collection also features "Sleeping Awake," the lead single and video for the
Matrix Reloaded soundtrack in 2003 and the first song to feature guitarist Jason
Truby, who replaced Curiel in 2002. GREATEST HITS compiles five tracks from the
band's last two albums - both Top 10 hits - including "Execute The Sounds" and
"Will You" from Payable On Death (2003). Ãœber-producer Glen Ballard helmed the
group's 2006 release Testify, which spawned the hit singles "Goodbye For Now"
and "Lights Out." The album also features "If It Wasn't For You," a song lifted
from 2005's The Warriors EP, Vol. 2, and "Truly Amazing," which was featured on
the 2004 compilation The Passion Of The Christ: Songs (Original Songs Inspired
By The Film).
