,Salustius,2006-12-01T16:05Z,"Plese keep seeding. The tracker statistics are wrong. At this momenet nobody is seeding...
Some Swedish, Canadians and US Americans have 100% and were seeding pretty good this morning (GMT time). By noon, they all stopped. WHy?. Probabaly because the tracker mislead them
Please seed longer again..."
