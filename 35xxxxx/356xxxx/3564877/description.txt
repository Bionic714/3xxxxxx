Modern English began as a punk band called the Lepers in 1979, with Robbie Grey (vocals and guitar), Gary McDowell (guitar), and Richard Brown (drums). Following the addition of Mick Conroy (bass), and Stephen Walker (keyboards) they changed their name to Modern English, and signed to 4AD Records. They released their first singles "Swans on Glass" and "Gathering Dust" in 1981, before coming out with their debut LP Mesh and Lace, a gothic record inspired by bands like Bauhaus and Joy Division.

The following year, the band had moved away from the art styling of their debut, and came out with the more pop album, After the Snow. A single from the album, "I Melt With You", soon became popular on MTV...
