Prisoners? Inventions is a collaboration between Temporary Services,a group based in Chicago, and Angelo, 
who is incarcerated in California. Angelo illustrated and described many incredible inventions made by prisoners. 
The creations include cooking appliances, cigarette lighters, condoms and chess sets. 
These items often fill needs that are not addressed within the usual restrictions of the prison environment. 
Temporary Services co-edited a book of Angelo?s writings and drawings, re-created many of the inventions from the book, 
and built a full-size replica of Angelo?s cell at his request.
