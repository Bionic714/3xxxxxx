,Popocapetl,2007-03-22T18:21Z,"You can download this update legally, at Roxio's site. You just need to register with a valid email address. Like one of those special addresses-for-garbage you probably keep at Hotmail or Bigfoot. 

Same for other Toast updates.

Roxio is calling them ""updates"" but never seem to require that you have installed a previous version of Toast. So they're in fact full programs. 

For a S/N, search the Internet for something called ""Serial Box""."
