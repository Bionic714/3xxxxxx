The Crash Of Flight 191

What happens when an airline and federal agency detect a design or mechanical flaw in an airliner and choose to ignore the "acceptable risk" because it's costly to fix and may not cause a problem?

On May 25, 1979, 271 people fastened their seatbelts for a flight from Chicago to LA. Almost as soon as the DC-10 took off, it plummeted to earth, exploding in flames.

This is a story of greed and deceit, arrogance and spin control, and how the fallout brought aviation giant McDonnell-Douglas to its knees.
