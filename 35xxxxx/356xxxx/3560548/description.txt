This Terminator 3 fan edition runs 4 minutes shorter than the original movie. What is left is a darker movie, following the style of the first Terminator movie. Now, Terminator\'s mission has become a race against the clock.
No more cheesy oneliners or ridiculous scenes. The Terminator focusses completely on the mission. The T-X is faster, more powerful and more intelligent. No more romance between John and Kate. A complete new opening, plus a reference to T2\'s Cyberdyne Systems.
