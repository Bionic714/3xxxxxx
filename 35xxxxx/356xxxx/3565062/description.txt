According to those who leaked this info (or acted as they did) , this is a manual originally written to be used by Muslim terrorists.

I think that the initial chapter, the introduction with lots of Allah blabber could be some kind of anti-Muslim propaganda. Or maybe its not, and it was really written that way *for* Muslim fundamentalists and not against them as I suspect.

But once again, how much do we really know about secret operations? the so-called "war" on terror may be a fake after all, and terror itself may be sponsored by the West *to* keep the "war" going, and so on...
(or maybe not)

The point is, regardless why wrote this manual and why they did it, the info *is* interesting.
