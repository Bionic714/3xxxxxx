you can get both tracker addresses to work: right click on the line of this download, go to 'properties' and edit the lower tracker line adding an 'e' at the end (/announce instead of /a"

No, maybe I hate W more. (not that it matters anyways)"

The ZERO freedom and rights bit i can understand but where do you get the chashless bit from. it's by having a form of currency that we are held in check and our 'self worth' is gauged. We are obliged to compare ourselves to others and fight amongst ourselves in the school yard of life for the tiny piece of nothing that someone else might have that we don't. This fact alone prevents us as a collective from functioning. Hence allowing the few in power to exploit. Ultimately it leads to nowhere but then, who ever said there was a reason for us being here anyway."

Maybe you come from some unknown civilization on a deserted island that forces religion down someone's throat, but I live in the real world and that never happens. They believe strongly and won't take any input on anything, that's why they're not liked, and it's totally their right. dumbass"
