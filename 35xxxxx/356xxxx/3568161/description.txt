FREE WALKING & INTHEWEATHER PUBLICATIONS.

FREEWALKING.ORG
Free Walking is about going on walks, together or alone. 
It functions as an ongoing project to explore time outside. 
Like all cultural work it is a form of entertainment. 
The walks tend to be designed or lead by someone with a 
local knowledge that they have accumulated either through 
research or through their day to day experience of a place. 
At the center of Free Walking activity is Bonnie Fortune. 
In early 2004, with a group of friends, she initiated conversations 
about making walks together. 
The experiences that have come from this have been rewarding ones 
and have brought us into contact with new friends and new ideas, 
so we continue or exploration. To read some of the writing from the 
Free Walking zines section of this website, where we also have PDFs 
available for download. Freewalking.org will continue to develop as 
a public documentation of walks and projects.

INTHEWEATHER.ORG
A map of a walk records the memory of a singular experience. 
The map provides a route; when directions given by another are followed, 
the route becomes a path. Walking becomes an exploration of the city at once private and shared.

Melinda Fries and Bonnie Fortune share an interest in exploratory walking 
and have collaborated as In The Weather since 2004. 
This year we published In the Weather self-guided walks/Chicago, 
which includes walking directions by 16 Chicagoans. 
The booklet is dispensed freely at 10 locations throughout Chicago.

In 2005 we decided to collect walks from around the world, 
with the In The Weather website being the result. 
We'd love for you to participate and share the memory of a walk, 
a favorite walk, or a walk you'd like to take.

Enjoy!
