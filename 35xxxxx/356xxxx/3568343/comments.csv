,Supremus,2006-12-01T07:58Z,All my releases are NTSC. You can convert them to PAL using ConvertXtoDVD though.

,macyme,2006-12-03T18:32Z,anyone seeding this with a complete copy. 
,erogaki,2006-12-04T14:13Z,But 1 seed at 100 KB/s is faster tant 50 seeds at 1 KB/s...
,Supremus,2006-12-04T14:57Z,"Sure, except my upload peaks between 60KB/sec to 80KB/sec. Makes it hard to support a large swarm of peers if I'm forever the only seed... "
,bobv1000,2007-01-19T21:20Z,"What gives????
I have downloaded 99.9% with only 4MB left and then everything (300MB+) is classified as rubbish. The only file left to finish is VTS_01_3.VOB.
Any ideas????"
