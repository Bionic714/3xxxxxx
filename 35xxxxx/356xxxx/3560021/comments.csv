Does somebody have Eddie Izzard's ""Dress to kill""? If you do could you please upload it?"
,novicegt,2010-09-20T07:15Z,"Eddie Izzard is always great. However, this particular performance of Sexie seems very all over the place and unpracticed. There are other versions of this performance which (IMO) are funnier and better put together.

Not really sure why they chose this particular performance for the DVD, but still a must-have for any Izzard fan which goes without saying.

Thanks for uploading!"
