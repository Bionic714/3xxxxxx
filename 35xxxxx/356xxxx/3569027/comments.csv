,Storm_661,2006-12-02T17:17Z,Req - The alphasim b1b updated version
,Robihot,2006-12-03T00:16Z,"About the gauges:

It's been awhile since I've installed it, but I think there's a ""Gauges"" folder in the aircraft\alpha F-22... folder, just put those guages in your main Gauges folder."
,Robihot,2006-12-03T00:17Z,"I forget if there's a radar in this addon, but I never found one.  I always had a bit of trouble with Alphasim's addons, like the Alphasim's Su-27 radar never worked.
"
,Robihot,2006-12-03T00:18Z,"Also I think there's an ""Effects"" folder inside the Aircraft\Alpha F-22A Raptor folder also, which should go into your FS9 Effects folder."
,leop4rdo19,2006-12-03T00:49Z,Thanks You!!.. I finish Solving the Problem.
,Robihot,2006-12-03T03:20Z,"np guys, enjoy!"
,)v(3thuDmaN,2006-12-03T07:24Z,I found it. In my aircraft folder (not F-22) was an Effects folder that has the gauges and effects files.
