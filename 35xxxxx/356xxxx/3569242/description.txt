DEAR MUSIC LOVERS,

This mixed music cd is one of my MIXAMIX series.
This cds are made mainly as road music but some of them can be easily used for parties.
I make this cds to accompany me and my friends at car or excursions.

The motive for making these cds was the fact that I could not find a radio station 
playing the music I like without interuptions. So I started making my 1hour and a half music experience.
I like various kinds of music and like to hear them intermixed. That is a risk no radio station takes and also not many djs in the world. 
Till now only Paul Oakenfold , Daniel Davoli and a few more 
have managed to marry many kinds and ages of music together.

Anyways, hope you enjoy this mixed disks as much as I do.
Remember that I am not professional, I do this as a hobby.
The date after MIXAMIX is the date I have started creating each of this cds. 
The creation may take from just one day to many months.

A few words about MIXAMIX 20061007

Ok Lads and Geds,
  Here you have my latest mix. I am working on this the last 2 months 
  Since I was somewhat busy with many other things except music I felt
  the need for some trippy music with an 80s essence in it 
  So here it it 80s , trippy sounds , breaks and eurotrance
  all together as usual. Tried to make some unique mixes as well, as usual.
  For your ears only... Enjoy!
