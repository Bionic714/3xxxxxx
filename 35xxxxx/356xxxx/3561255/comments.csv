,2020wayne,2006-11-20T19:32Z,"The hard drive is formated to NTFS for larger single files. The version of Nero we use is 6.6.1.4, old i know but it gives better result that v7. The drive used is a Pioneer 101, in nero set copy disc to UDF image. Takes about 45mins & 45mins to write to disc. All Blu-ray films have been copied this way with 100% results, all played back perfectly. The first releases of the new films must have no copy protection, or it is just plain rubbish. The back of HOSTEL says that it is copy protected, but this must be the world easiest protection to break.

Nero does not have to support Blu-ray, it just has to support UDF, the MAC is perfect for this using Toast v7 we had exactly the same results."
,Patsfan123,2006-11-20T20:56Z,I don't have a blue-ray player but this should not play.  Every BD and HD title has AACS encryption; CSS on steroids.  It has not been cracked.. yet.  DVD Jon (guy who cracked CSS) said hes working on AACS and plans on cracking it by the end of the winter.  AACS works by reading the volume ID which is physically imprinted on the disc and cannot be copied.  So a BD-Rom wouldn't work since it would have a different volume ID.  But if it does work.. more power to you!
,macgyverfan,2006-11-23T15:21Z,hmm i think its not real...and will not be playable.... :(
,macgyverfan,2006-11-23T15:22Z,besides theres no seed and are 6 peers

Are you serious about this?"
,Junx,2006-12-03T08:15Z,"I know that cdrecord has support for Blu-ray already for some reason, so I'd assume there has to be some other software that does."
,Fysle,2006-12-03T20:18Z,Got damn right there CPJACK
,oldslow,2007-01-06T20:33Z,Blue-ray can be read...writing is a whole other matter..I suspect this is fraudulent...
,mooglez,2007-02-01T21:44Z,"The guy who broke hd-dvd in december 06 also broke blu-ray protection just 12 days later or so.

Bly-ray movies are already in circulation on torrent sites."
,mooglez,2007-02-01T21:49Z,"also, as current Blu-ray movies are mpeg2 they a lot nicer on your CPU compared to the VC-1 HD-DVD releases.

I'm not sure of this release as it's a nero image. but 
on a normal file blu-ray / hd-dvd you could just start playing the video from the file containing it, without any need to burn it first.. with a supporting software player of course.

And i think nero has had blu-ray burning support for many version already"
,bigpappax,2007-02-13T20:33Z,"I dont understand, how do you rip the blu ray movie without a blu ray player? Also, according to some sites that show every blu ray movie release, non of them have hostel listed. So is this torrent BS?"
,Krokkedille,2008-01-22T01:14Z,"http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3680708/Hostel.2005.720p.DVD5.BluRay.x264-SEPTiC
There is a copy (recode) of Hostel as you see here"
,Krokkedille,2008-01-22T01:39Z,"Offcouse the recode version, is not a full version, but it prove that it can be done, so no resson to doubt, whether it can be done or not, it have been done a lot."
