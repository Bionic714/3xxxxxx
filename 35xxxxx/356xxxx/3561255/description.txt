Blu-ray HOSTEL, Quentin Tarantino. This disc has to be burnt onto a Blu-ray 25GB disc using Nero. Nothing has been ripped, the full disc is in 1920x1080p.
Plays perfectly, i thought these things were uncopyable?? ;)

I know the blank disc are expensive @ the moment but we have to start somewhere.
