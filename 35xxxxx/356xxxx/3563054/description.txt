Release Notes:

After a hugely successful reunion tour which saw
them play to over half a million people, Take That
unveil their first album for over ten years,
'Beautiful World', which features writing
contributions from all four members.
Take That are one of the most successful British
bands since the Beatles, notching up eight #1
singles and selling a staggering 25 million records
across the globe. Their return to the frontline of
British pop has been assured with a twice extended
sell-out UK tour as well as a Rose D'Or nominated
documentary 'Take That - For The Record' which was
one of the highest rated and most talked-about music
TV programmes of last year.
