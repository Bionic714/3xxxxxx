,OrpheusDude,2011-03-05T19:48Z,"Can someone please tell me the difference(s) between the 1968 and 2000 versions?  Was the original album completely re-recorded in 2000, or were the original elements remixed and remastered?  Thanks!  I remember when the album first came out and what a sensation it was for its time."
,OrpheusDude,2011-03-05T21:02Z,"OK: I did some research.  The original ""Switched-On Bach"" (the hyphen in the title is correct) was released on Columbia Masterworks Records in 1968.

In 1992, Wendy Carlos rerecorded the original album with two additional tracks for the Teldec label for an album called ""Switched-On Bach 2000"" using contemporary digital instruments, creating a radically different sound than the original album.  It was not well-received.

In 2001, Sony Classical Records (successor-in-interest to Columbia/CBS Records) re-released a CD of an ""enhanced"" version of the 1968 album.

Got all that?

Anyway, this torrent is the 1968 Columbia Masterworks recording, and definitely NOT the 2000 Teldec version.  Whether or not it's the 2001 ""enhanced"" version, I can't tell.
