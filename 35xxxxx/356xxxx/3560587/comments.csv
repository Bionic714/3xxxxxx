,Sazpaimon,2006-11-19T23:56Z,"Very few of them have minor sync issues, most of which are un-noticable unless you're actually looking for them.  I'll make sure Silver and Last dont have these issues."
,eggewert2,2006-11-21T15:44Z,"No, your files are just fine! My problems were playback issues. I fixed them and now they work wonderfully for me too. Thanks for the nice upload!"

I wanted to say thank you for distributing these.I own the game (bought it for $11), and knowingly bought it after having a horrible playthrough on a rental.  I appreciate these being available because the gameplay is just too frustrating for me to complete.  These make my life less stressful.  Thank you."
