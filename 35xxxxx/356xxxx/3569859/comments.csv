,darkg,2007-02-10T06:06Z,"Nice, now I got all of these covers packs 1-96 (and I'll seed 'em all for days *sweetheart me*)

Except this single one (86)... stuck at 68.1% :-/
I guess it will come around eventually though :-)"
,darkg,2007-02-10T10:35Z,"It's all fine; all current (1-96) downloaded - thanks to Biomechanical and others who seed!

4 more packages and it's a thousand covers :-D"
