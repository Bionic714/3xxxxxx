,axely,2008-05-31T10:14Z,"please seed
I am 99,3%"
,axely,2008-06-29T23:11Z,reseed please.
[V],Kuthumi,2012-01-14T23:07Z,"Imagine that this torrent still exists 5 years after I downloaded it! It now stands at 99.3 % which probably is enough to play it and burn it. Nero gave error messages even when it was 100%, but it may run OK in your standalone player. I tried to restore the full 100% but failed."
