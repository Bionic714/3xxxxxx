[T],WinstonSmith6079,2006-12-04T10:58Z,"You're welcome!  It is an excellent film--the scariest movie I've ever seen!  Carpenter is as ingenious as ever here, and IMHO this is his greatest work.

If you like this film, try The Thing from Another World [1951] by the great Howard Hawks, from which this film is remade (sort of).  Take a look here:
