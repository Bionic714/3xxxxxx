If you watch this in Europe (Animal Planet) and are used to British english narration you won't be able to stand this for more than 5 mins.

I had to delete both seasons and am still hunting for a version with the narrator speaking the proper english."

From my experiences British people speak a slurred version of English >.> IDC if its where the language came from..."
,DRAC2GUNZ,2008-05-29T07:50Z,Oh and TY for the upload! Good show!
,AWu-TangLife,2008-07-11T00:33Z,Motherfuck the British. Bunch of uncle tom niggaz.....
,panther1499,2008-07-13T14:07Z,"Thanks for this. I'm in the UK and think the narrator (although different from the version we see over here) does a great job. Incidentally, the UK narrator is the guy who plays Davy Jones in pirates of the Caribbean at World's End and Dead Man's Chest."
,dabadoo306,2008-09-22T19:03Z,"You who are bad mouthing the Brits:  This is where YOUR language came from...    
*what format is this in?  .AVI?  .MP4?  Just wondering.... Love the Sean Astin narration.... I know he did later narration, but have never seen the first season."
,therealsandaili,2008-12-30T14:02Z,Thank you soooo much...will anyone be upping Season 3? I really need it. I have parts of it (to whomever upped it before). If anyone can up it I will seed it for months if I can get it. I believe they were all tvrips.
,ZeMonstaKitten,2009-02-01T13:47Z,"Could anyone seed or up their upload limit? This is frustratingly slow.
Ty"
,kadzunk63,2009-06-16T19:57Z,"Thanks for the upload! American narration will be interesting I guess.. it's the meerkats that make the show! 

Thanks again!"
,Sandywichsboy,2010-06-06T05:15Z,"This may have American narration, but that's the least of this releases's problems.

The video is shocking. Not quite eyecancer quality, but still pretty bad.

The video isn't even centred on the screen! It is near the bottom of the screen, and there is a horrible line at the very top of the screen.
Why is it in widescreen? The show was originally full screen to begin with, so there must be some severe cropping going on somewhere here.

The files have the .divx extension, meaning I have to right click-open to play it. If I double click, a spybot scan window opens instead. I know i know, name it to .avi after I'm finished, but it's still bloody annoying having to do so.

And finally, it's got what has to be the most annoying and HUGE watermark logo I've ever seen on the screen.

This isn't worth downloading. If you really love Meerkat Manor, don't download this, go buy the DVDs instead (as I have just done, with the proper UK commentary no less)."
,vivatpb5776,2010-11-08T23:50Z,"If I may comment on Sandywichsboy's critique of the torrent:

""it's got what has to be the most annoying and HUGE watermark logo I've ever seen on the screen.""

This is a TVRip, not a DVDRip. Thus, the watermark logos he referred to are TV Rating, the fact that the show is in Closed Caption, and the channel's (Animal Planet) logo. The first two are only during the first few seconds after the show returns from commercial break....and no, there are no commercials. The channel logo is common on all television shows.

""The files have the .divx extension, meaning I have to right click-open to play it.""

Wrong. Use a real player like VLC. I had no problem playing each episode through the VLC app.

""If I double click, a spybot scan window opens instead.""

Don't know what third rate security application you are using but there should be no reason that the security application should pop up after you double click on the file. I always do a shell extension test on any file I download. I use Malwarebytes, SuperAntiSpyware, and AVG. All three came up clean.

""The video is shocking. Not quite eyecancer quality, but still pretty bad.""

Again, this is a TVRip, not a DVDRip. That being said, the quality of the rip is very good. For TVRips, I would give it a 8.5/10.

""The video isn't even centred on the screen! It is near the bottom of the screen, and there is a horrible line at the very top of the screen.

This is the only point that I agree with. At times, you can tell this was forced into a 16:9 format. The uploader should have left well enough alone and kept it at 4:3.

All in all, the is a very good download. Quite frankly, who cares whether it is British English or American English narrated. The story is of the meerkats, not the narration."
,megido,2011-02-15T22:38Z,"the narrator is seriously bad.
he has no sense of humor.
there is no compassion.
he has no feeling for 'flow', his delivery is way out of sync with the pace of the show.
he does not have a particularly good voice.
he is incredibly BORING.

it's not that he is an american.
whoopi goldberg did 'the beginning' and she is great.

this narrator is so bad that this great show has become unwatchable to me. i need to find a copy of the original, with the british guy. he is great, too."
,kludge420,2011-04-02T03:23Z,"Hey Zver999, douchebag, it took America to correct the fucked up English language where they pronounce letters that aren't there like those idiots can't even pronounce ""data!"" Dumbasses."
,siggy13,2011-10-31T03:57Z,"Wow..I've just read all the comments and seriously some of you need to grow up! If you have childish complaints as you have..GO BUY THE DVD""S!!! And CHEERS to vivatpb5776 for analysing sandywichsboy's patheticness!!!!!!"
,x30001wtm,2012-04-18T23:41Z,"I've been hoping for years for someone to share the Brit version since I can't stand to listen to Sean Astin for more than fifteen seconds.  Why?

Because of the way

he pauses

for dramatic effect

three or four times

every sentence.

FUCK what an asshole!  Somebody please share the Brit versions and I'll help seed for years to come."
