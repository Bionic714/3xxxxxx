,philbongahue,2007-02-10T00:36Z,Pretty weak that people would pirate these.  3 bucks is well worth the laughs.  I buy 'em cuz I don't want Mike to have to go back to TGI Fridays.
,Sluggerton the third,2007-03-09T16:47Z,After this release?  I'd want my 3$ back.
,Maoxx,2007-05-29T23:35Z,Positively not funny.
