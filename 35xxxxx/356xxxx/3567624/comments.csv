,Rolle12,2006-11-30T05:38Z,"Hi bugguy.
Sonesson is aying: Hello. We have all the new DVD-R's at swepiracy. Seek Google for swepiracy because I can't write the full link here."

,jaal,2006-11-30T13:40Z,Is this a DVD (Back To School.avi) NO it's NOT.
[T],bugguy,2006-11-30T22:49Z,"Thanks Rolle12, I guess I'll just take it as neutral.  The .avi is formated for a single DVD-R, but thanks for the constructive comment:-)"
