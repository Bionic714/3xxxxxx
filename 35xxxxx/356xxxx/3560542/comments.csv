i am very disturbed by your retarded ""leet speak"" or what ever you 14 year old mongoloids call it. ...if you ever grow up, you would perhaps want to drop that  embarrassing habbit. that is if you ever want to even taste the smell of pussy...now, go back to counting your few newly grown pubes..."
,Musika,2007-01-21T17:33Z,"punk your a fucking retard, get a life, plus you can't taste smell. Get educated"
,drexon14,2007-01-21T21:35Z,"Musika:  ""Get educated?"" Well... let's see.

Dictionary description for the word 'taste':

5. to have or get experience, esp. a slight experience: these young men who had only begun to taste life. 

... Idiot."
,divmediat,2007-01-23T00:46Z,"alot of ego i smell in this hall. but since I'm a noob, I'm perfectly fine ^^

peace"
,pincopallo,2007-01-23T18:09Z,"So does this torrent contain only Flash Dreamweaver and fireworks?
Is the serial working fine?
I think that when somebody uploads something,should be a little more descriptive.
Anyway,the download is really fast,so a big thanks goes to the seeders,and obviously to the uploader.
But please,next time be somehow more descriptive about what's in the torrent (expecially when it's an archive file,as we cannot see what's inside it).
Bye"
,pincopallo,2007-01-23T18:56Z,"Ok,i'm gonna add some hopefully useful infos for this torrent.

The torrent only contains the three executables of dreamweaver flash and fireworks (which is fine for me,as i do not need all the other programs included in the full macromedia studio 8 package).
The torrent also include a txt file with a serial in it.
I used the serial for dreamweaver; after the installation was done,a window appeard asking me if i wanted to try the program (free 30-day-trial),if i wanted to purchase it,or if i had a serial number to activate the program.So i  chose the last one,typed the serial mentioned before,and worked fine.
After that i installed flash,but it didn't asked me for any serial number,seems to work fine without any activation,i'll come back here after 30 days to tell you if it's still working.
bye"
