,ZoMeOnE,2006-11-23T12:34Z,is there an ending on this version beacuse the last 3 didnt have any
,grash54,2006-11-23T17:27Z,The last 6 that I downloaded (2 from this site and 4 from other sites) were all the same.  One was recoded an over a gig in size.  But it was the same crap as the other five.  Just a copy recoded and made bigger.  The majority was from dOpe.  I'm not downloading anymore until someone says it's OK.  Does anyone know if this one has the ending?
