,Andreting1,2006-11-27T20:51Z,"I downloaded the game and launched it, and the menu looked fine. But when I get to the game window the screen has kind of a black layer! (I can see a very thin sliver of the actual game on one side, a grey, stone like ?thing? in different places and sizes (when I change resolution the size and form change) and I can see the health bar and the directions. Everything else is black. Like mentioned, I?ve tried changing resolution, and I also tried reinstalling the game, no change. Anyone know what else to do?"

,downloading king,2006-11-28T15:07Z,what of the file do i mount it 
,homieGdog,2006-11-29T05:44Z,"I'm having some problems with this torrent, when I open up the folder there is just a bunch of numbered files.  How do I extract?"
,SilverDK,2006-11-29T06:12Z,"I kinda have the same problem. I figured out the files are rar, though there aren't any .rar file, only the .001 - .054 (for cd1), and when extracting they are all displaying crc errors.

Any ideas, anyone ?"
,SilverDK,2006-11-29T06:15Z,"Update: Okies i figured out what the problem was..

It seems that you need to use one of the newest WinRar (or Rar extractors) for the file to be extracted correctly..

You can get the newest one here: http://www.rarlab.com"
,H4rdR0cker,2006-12-01T04:30Z,"Why dose it look so strange. I cant se the menu or anything.
And the resultionen is very small. How do i fix this ?
Is this just a rip from a Xbox 360 game."
,GeNg6,2006-12-01T16:16Z,"I've only got files that I can't do anything with. None RAR-files, only files that I don't know what to do.

Do you know how I should do?

,orphan,2006-12-12T19:16Z,Well folks this is what i did to get the came to work. Unrar files you will get four cd's in these cd files you will get four image files. set up a directory on your HD called like fair light. In this directory place four folders called cd 1 to 4 now download the no cd crack and place it in the fairlight folder. with iso buster extract the images to the fairlight folder cd1 to 4. Burn the whole fairlight folder to a data dvd. Install the game.copy the two files from the crack/fairlight directory to your program/fairlight/eragon directory. enjoy.
,victor92,2006-12-13T17:04Z,"wtf no files that are extraktable, and no file to mount only files with the image when it doesnt know what program to use"
,victor92,2006-12-13T17:16Z,"oh got it , extrakted the first file in cd 1( had to change it to the file would start with winrar) then i mounted that file and got the installation running"
,make7acs,2006-12-13T21:28Z,"Ok. Since a lot of people are having trouble opening this, I'll go through it STEP by STEP.

After your download finishes you should have a folder named Eragon-FLT (in the folder where your downloads go)

Double click that folder, you will see four folders named cd 1 cd 2 cd 3 and cd 4

Do not click them yet.

Open win rar

Right click CD1 folder and go into properties

Copy the location (completley)

paste it into the winrar address bar

You should see the same folder pop up on the winrar window

Rightclick  cd1 and click ""add to archive""

it should begin adding to archives.

Do this once for each cd, when you are finished you should have 1 winrar file for each CD.

now extract them to a seperate folder, cue and bin files will appear for each CD.

Mount these, and there ya go.

If you need a no cd crack you can download it from here.
