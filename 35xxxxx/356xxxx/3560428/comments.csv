Downloaded the program from the website

Used the codes posted here (thx ThePirates AVD!)

Just ripped Casino Royale (as a test, I own the DVD) worked perfectly, fast and great quality too!

As a side note, I tried a few 'rippers' and none successfully ripped Casino Royale except this one!

It's only $35, I'm gonna buy it, so they keep the program up to date!"

,shiftee86,2009-11-28T03:23Z,"can you copy and paste your MagicDVDRipper.INI file. mine currently reads

[Register]
UserName=www.serials.ws
RegisterCode=E6DY50P5Q8A0R66QRG9EJV7M4QLRV7
[Skin]
Sheet=1
Left=209
Top=158

and when i tried to start my 7th rip, i got the same problem regarding registry key being wrong

should the UserName read as ThePirates AVD?"
,kdryan,2010-01-06T11:16Z,"This works great once you apply the registry edit fix (look at other Magic DVD ripper Torrents), but it only allows one file to rip at a time.  It would be much nicer to be able to que up a bunch and leave them so they'll be done when you come back.

Try Any DVD Converter Pro, you can find it here on TPB.  I think you'll find it a lot more useful..."
,wiskey_assassin,2010-01-29T17:46Z,"Hi all i went looking for the reg key for this program and found this....

Registration code: User name: Team Crude 
Registration Code: A83-307reShlRP^:8q9

,ryn.cor21,2012-05-25T23:52Z,"Hey, if theres anyone out there that sees that the patch fails after a few tries here is what you do:

Block the program with windows firewall (w7):
1. type ""firewall"" in start menu
2. click ""Windows Firewall with advanced security""
3. click ""outbound rules"" on right
4. click ""new rule"" on left
5. Set ""rule type"" to program
6. set the program to ""magic dvd ripper
.exe"" in your install directory
7. set the rule to block the program
8. set the rule to apply to all ip addresses.
9. set the rule to apply to all networks (home, work etc.)

When you do this the program can't ""phone home"" to check if the key is blacklisted.

These insturctions might be different for your operating system or firewall in use."
