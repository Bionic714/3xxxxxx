A classic Jamaican movie from 1978 about some rastafarians struggling with their daily lives in Kingston's slum areas, playing reggae, earning money and robbing the mafia in a Robin Hood kind of way. :) Virtually the entire cast is comprised of Jamaica's leading reggae musicians.

A little warning: Jamaican english, especially creole and rastafarian, is one of the most extreme english accents there is. Fortunatly it's subtitled most of the time but it's not translated to british/american english, it's subtitled in the original jamaican rastafarian english. You'll understand 99% of what they say (by reading the subtitles) if you read this page before watching it:
