Synopsis

"Exciting conflict and cutting edge special effects that truly entertain" -Gene Siskel, Chicago Tribune. Engage! Captain Jean-Luc Picard and his Next Generation crew are back and so is the excitement and fun in this "polished film that shines like a crown jewel in the Star Trek firmament" (George Powell, San Francisco Examiner). From the beginning of the Federation, the Prime Directive was clear: no Starfleet expedition may interfere with the natural development of other civilizations. But now Picard is confronted with orders that undermine that decree. If he obeys, 600 peaceful residents of Baku will be forcibly removed from their remarkable world, all for the reportedly greater good of millions who will benefit from Bakus Fountain of Youth-like powers. If he disobeys, he will risk his Starship, his career, his life. But for Picard, theres really only one choice. He must rebel against Starfleet... and lead the insurrection to preserve Paradise.
