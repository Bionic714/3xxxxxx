How can you tell - 3 minutes after the torrent is uploaded."
,IOError,2006-11-29T05:38Z,"These files have been posted on about 3 sites now and would appear to be an advertisment for the so-king website trying to seel their products... It has been sitting on the Demonoid website now for 4 days with no new seeders and only people complaining. So-King appears to be just a spammer and has not answered ANYONE about the validity of the files... 

It is an unseeded fake - don't waste your time."
