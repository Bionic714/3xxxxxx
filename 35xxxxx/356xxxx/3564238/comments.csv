,Hasnain,2006-11-26T03:10Z,"You mean the extreme mullahs??


In the Northwestern provinces of Pakistan, NWFP and FATA
(North West Frontier Province and Federally Administered Tribal Areas)

As you can see read from the name, these areas are tribally administered so the government has no control here (no gov admin, police office, army etc). 

This is where the extremists can hide. But you can't blame the Pakistani government for this, ever since Pakistan came into being the NWFP and FATA have always been controlled by Tribal/Feudal lords, and they have alot of support of easily confused muslims which could threat the stability of the government. 

So, unless people become more educated and gain confidence in the Pak gov, it will take some more time to deal with extremism. 

The good news currently is that the religious extreme political party has supposedly left the Pakistan government now that a women's rights bills was passed. 

So hopefully with their diminished power, a more moderate government will come in the NWFP and the extremists will feel threatened and have to find refuge elsewhere.
