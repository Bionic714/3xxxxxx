I have just downloaded it and I did the following steps: 

1) I used winrar on the 52files

2) Then I got a huge iso file where I used Daemon tools to open with.

3) THen I used winrar again to open the winrar files in the this iso File.


4) at last I got some new files where one of them has ""the rise of the witch king autorun setup file"" 

which step did I do wrong, or rather what havent I done right? Pls answear fast:)

,Pocatello,2006-12-27T03:05Z,"This game works fine.  I got it working with no problems.


***** I suggest that you not download, and do not install, the other files that are supposed to help with this install.  Like a ""missing part"" of the RAR, or a crack fix from reloaded.

I did not need those extra files.  I think they are probably virus or trojans or something evil.

This 4.01 GB download was enough by itself.

I hope I made myself clear.

Best of luck."

It works for the first battle of middle earth, the Second and third. 
When you make the file, be first to load the game you wanna play, and if fails, then do it, cause then the folder will pop up in Application Data called, My Lord of the RIngs Battle for Middle Earth File, and then you put it in. you gotta do this for the battle for middle earth II and expansion, start the game first, get the error, and you can find that file.

,killller54,2008-08-05T15:47Z,"ok, i MAY have a solution to those, who lose every battle in 3-5 mins, due to some fault in the game. i had the same problem once with this game, and the original. i didn't know what to do back then with the expansion, but with the original, when i put the CD in, it gave me the installation page. so i installed the game again, when i could play just fine, but i lose every battle. if it was installed, the game worked fine, no defeats in 3-5mins, and i got to keep my saves.


just mount the unrared file, and open the autorun, so u could install it again, but DO NOT uninstall it first, cuz i don't know, what it'll do. 


    BUT REMEMBER, it MAY be the solution, i did it on the original, what i BOUGHT, so i don't know, what it'll do to this thing"

,ownage321,2010-04-18T12:51Z,"Here's the problem with ALL KNOWN currently circulating ""cracks"" for both BFME2 and the ROWK expansion: They don't work for multiplayer LAN games. This is because the protection hasn't been properly cracked because the guys who reversed the .exe didn't take into account (or test) the protection of the games in a MP LAN environment! So what happens is that every time the game starts, a random ""garbage version number"" is assigned (one of the protections they missed) to the running game. This results in the inability to start a LAN game because of the error ""version mismatch"".

Just try running the game with the cracked .exe and go to setup menu, you'll notice version numbers like ""0.1634714321, 0.012957432"" etc.. Bummer. We've solved it with mini-images and daemon-tools + anti-blacklisting software of SecuROM. By the way what files need to be changed so that we don't have to install the game ""fresh"" on all the machines?
