This is the NFL Monday Night Football game for 27 Nov 06.  Green Bay Packers at Seattle Seahawks.

It was recorded from the live TV feed to an Archos AV380.

The screen size is 320 x 240, 25 fps, 267kbps 24bit DivX.  The audio is 191kbps MPEG Layer-3.  

There are 2 AVI video files. The first is all of the 1st half plus some of the 2nd half.  The second file is the rest of the game.

I have left in some of the UK team commentary and all of the US team commentary.  I have tried to remove all of the other NFL game spoilers.
