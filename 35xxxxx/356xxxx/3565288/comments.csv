,rockstar_2610,2006-12-11T03:49Z,thnx dude..
,bmwtorrents,2006-12-12T21:59Z,No problem- enjoy!
,PTDennis,2006-12-29T03:02Z,works perfect! thanks from Portugal!
,bmwtorrents,2006-12-30T17:29Z,"No problem, my Portuguese friend!"
,shin0r,2006-12-31T12:22Z,"Yes! thanks mate, I'm on 70%, I'll seed of course!"
,bmwtorrents,2006-12-31T12:54Z,No problem- I hate the fact that BMW & Navteq are quite happy to charge ?300+ for something that's still not good enough- no 'speedtrap' POIs & no full UK postcode entry.
,shin0r,2006-12-31T14:01Z,I agree - you spend lots of money on a BMW but they still charge for the DVD - ridiculous!
,PTDennis,2007-01-01T16:12Z,the worst is that they want 300 every year to update the map! they donÂ´t even offer a discount for updates.. seed this!!

,marc.janssens,2007-02-05T21:00Z,"Hi,

- BUSINESS  ==> i have this one

Any suggestion ?

Thx"
,Sky_Line,2007-02-17T02:11Z,"I really appreciate some more number of seeder if it's possible!!!

Tanks for the seeders!!!"
,marcnalder,2007-03-08T13:57Z,"Can anyone tell me the specifics of burning this iso to a DVD?

Should you just be able to use Nero and set the booktype to dvd-rom using a dvd-r disk? Do you have to use dvd decryptor at all  with this iso? Do you need to make sure you use a certain quality DVD? Datasafe ok? or Verbatim preferred?

If you successfully managed to burn this and getting working in your bmw please can you add how you got yours to work?

Thanks..."
,320dat,2007-03-14T11:40Z,"Thanks a lot, works perfectly on my 07 E91/navi pro. Burned one -R, and one +R. Both OK."
,galc,2007-03-28T10:27Z,"Dear BMWtorrent,

Can I use this dvd on a laptop pc or on a normal dvd drive   
as I am afraid I do not own a BMW. "
,svante76,2007-04-04T16:38Z,I have the same question as Marc. Will this DVD work with the BMW Business Navigation System? 
,PhilippeC,2007-04-09T10:47Z,Thanks
,carrtim,2007-04-12T17:28Z,"Please help, I'm new to all this. When I click download this torrent I'm propted to save a file called 

BMW.Digital.Road.Map.Europe.Professional.DVD.2007.1.German-MooBS.3565288.TPBnew 

What do I do with this file? I am registered and logged in. Many thanks in advance"
,semog3370,2007-04-13T11:42Z,"Hi, the DVD work with the BMW Business Navigation System? "
,jrbit,2007-04-19T19:45Z,Is this version in German only? And will it work in my e53 (X5) 2005 mod.? And what is the difference between PROFESSIONAL and HIGH? Thx for the upload though ;-)
,goldlocken,2007-04-30T19:52Z,Can I use this for the BMW X5 E39???
,goldlocken,2007-05-01T09:28Z,"Hi, will this version work in my E53 (X5) 2002 mod.?
Thanks in advance!! "
,shin0r,2007-05-08T19:25Z,"To answer all questions so far:

1: This DVD will work ONLY on cars with the Professional Navigation, not Business Navigation.

2: It may work on e39 or e53 - it may not. It DOES  definitely work on e60, e61, e90, e63

3: You can burn it as dvd-r or dvd+r. The car is not fussy as to which brand.

4: Unrar the files with winrar, then file>new>select iso>burn with nero, or tool of your choice.

5: The DVD includes maps for Great Britain and Europe. The language of the DVD doesn't matter, as the car reads it, not a human.

6: You might be able to run the DVD from your PC, but as it's a roadmap DVD for BMW satnav, I don't know why you would.........

,schtaaf,2007-07-20T22:49Z,"Hi. I 'Unrared' the files and burnt them with Nero. When I tried the DVD in my E61 2006 with a professional nav system, it did not recognize the DVD and kept asking me to please insert the navigation DVD. Can anyone tell me what I have done wrong? Has anyone got this DVD working?"
,Rihardsbr,2008-05-17T11:51Z,"I insert navigation dvd in my x5 but nothing happens. Wat's the problem.?
