,jamesp22muk2004,2007-07-01T14:23Z,"!!IMPORTANT....INSTRUCTIONS....IMPORTANT!!!!


1. extract all the files

2. run ""Setup FM2007 PC.exe"" 

3. when this has finished, open the folder ""CaZzEr CrAcKz"" and in their should be the file ""fm.exe""

4. copy that file

5. then go to my computer - local disk C - program files - sports interactive - football manager 2007

6. when you are in the ""football manager 2007"" folder, paste ""fm.exe"" and overwrite when it asks you to

7. close everything so you get to the desktop and there should be the icon on the desktop

7. finished! all u have to do now is run the game from the icon on the desktop which should be called ""Football Manager 2007"""
