,iskongen,2006-11-29T23:33Z,"i had a lot of episodes around, most got accepted by the torrent, will upload them, tell me if something's wrong"
,iskongen,2006-11-30T19:30Z,"episodes 7, 14 and 17 wasn't accepted by the torrent

is there any interest in a new torrent with those three and episode 19?

or perhaps a new torrent for season 1 which would include episodes 1-17 + 19?

of course it would be properly seeded from the start"
