Genova Citta Aperta
Autori Vari (2001)

Impressions and expressions of the events that surrounded the 
Genoa Social Forum and the G8 meeting in July, 2001. 

It was a quite dramatic and traumatic experience for many. This 
documentary, which is just one of the many stories that could 
have been told, when more than 200.000 people come together, 
seeks to illuminate the joyous events, actions and imaginative 
theatres that painted the streets of Genova with a positive colour 
and gave good reason to be optimistic about the future. 

'Genova Citta Aperta' portrays impressions and expressions of the

'Another World is Possible Film Festival' in connection with the 
Asian Social Forum in Hyderabad, 2003. The documentary includes 
interviews with Genovese residents, artists, an anarchist catholic 
priest , the 'Living Theatre', and other interesting characters, 
such as environmentalist Nigerian lawyer, Oronto Douglas.
