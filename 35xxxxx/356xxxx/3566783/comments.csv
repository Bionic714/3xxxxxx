,Boiling1,2006-12-02T00:11Z,"Thanks for the upload ...and the share!
Although I've got the capable burner and the media, I've never burned a double-layered DVD9 before!
Before wasting expensive discs, I'm wondering if it's just to open the file in ImgBurn or Nero and burn it.
Or is there some ""tricks"" to be taken into consideration?"
