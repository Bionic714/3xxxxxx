,bthoer,2006-11-20T06:46Z,oh and putting mp3's in an archive is just plain dumb :)
,eggewert2,2006-11-20T10:22Z,"Oh no it isn't...You don't save storage space, of course, but that's not the point. Where did you get your manners, btw..."
,jackjack77777777,2006-11-20T14:20Z,Why not lossless? MP3 sucks. Big time.
