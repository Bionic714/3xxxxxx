,init6,2006-12-03T20:19Z,"What's the ""Part 1"" all about? How many episodes is in this part?"
,eterna111,2007-01-25T15:18Z,"According to TV.com season 6 only has 12 episodes, so this is actually complete.

Supremus: Thanks for putting these out! Amazing work! :) Keep seeding, everyone..."
,frank white,2007-01-29T06:47Z,"I believe the ""Part 1"" is referring to the fact that the final episodes that are airing in April will still technically be a part of season 6."
,bada-bing,2007-02-13T22:30Z,sweet release and perfectly ripped..many thanks!
,HelNQtt,2007-02-15T12:35Z,"Im Download this now! And i hope for some Seed!

,fuxxxor,2007-03-29T11:09Z,"Thanks for your rips of Sopranos. A bunch of weeks ago I hadn't seen a single show and now I'm hooked and downloading the 6th season. :D

Your rips are great!!"
,FaDeD.,2007-03-31T02:13Z,This isn't the complete season 6 there is a part 2 with 9 more episodes eterna111.... but thanks for the first 12
,helv81,2007-04-11T00:18Z,Thanks but it didn't worked right for me. Great images but NO sound! Maybe because I'm using a mac. I have tried with divx player and quicktime: same result. If someone has a hint to help that would be most welcome.
,helv81,2007-04-11T01:20Z,Rhhaaaaaah yeah! solved the problem by downloading VLC. Hope it helps
,KnutbyHelge,2007-04-29T17:15Z,"Downloading it atm, will seed it for like a month :)"

,Granchy,2007-12-12T04:13Z,"Your Sopranos rips are first rate!  I wish you had a part 2 for this season, but I've enjoyed all your other ones."

,se7se7se7,2008-01-27T02:39Z,"looks like the last time supremus put up a torrent was 12-19 2006... doesn't look good...

please supremus, come back with part 2!"
,Multidirectional,2008-03-17T15:57Z,"There is season 6 part 2 of the same quality already. Looks like it's done by some other person, but in the same manner. I'm not sure if I can give links to other torrent sites here. If someone would confirm that I'm allowed to do so, I'll give a link to those who can't find by themselves."
,crayola2,2008-06-15T01:02Z,"this guy needs to post season 6, part 2 to complete the collection."
