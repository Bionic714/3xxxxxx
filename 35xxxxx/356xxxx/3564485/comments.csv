,RockinPisces,2008-06-28T11:07Z,"This has to be the all time greatest TV series! I am blown away by the quality of the writing AND acting! The music is not just great, it adds to the comedy with such spice! Thanks so much for  this torrent as I can not find it in stores. I wish this sries got more acclaim like ""The Sopranos"" did. Each episode is an adventure in ""high"" comedy!"
