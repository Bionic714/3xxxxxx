,Ozma[FIN],2006-11-22T15:47Z,Oh yeah ... and remember to seed to keep the scene alive!
,janker,2006-11-23T13:18Z,why so low quality :(
,Ozma[FIN],2006-11-23T14:30Z,I havent ripped it myself... I dont even know why people rips cds with such a bad quality. 192kbs would have been much nicer.
,mdtrx,2006-11-24T03:52Z,"Paskaa!
192kpbs.. Paskaa!

Hyvää on LOSSLESS (FLAC, APE) tai vähintään 320kpbs!"
,antsaah,2006-11-25T11:04Z,"Imekää peukkua , tää on parasta"
,Malz,2006-11-26T23:16Z,"This is crappy torrent. Every 128 kbps MP3 file should be destroyed and the users which spread them, should be banned.

So buy this one and get full CD-quality stuff."
,Ozma[FIN],2006-11-27T06:55Z,320kbps version on the way....
