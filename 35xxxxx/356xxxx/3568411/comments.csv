,ticktock_man,2006-12-08T14:30Z,"ugh, baked-in subs. nice: so those of us who arent swedish get to see your retarded gibberish for two hours.
the aspect ratio is also fucked, and needs to be changed to 16:9 in VLC player to work.

i dont see why it would have been such a problem to include subtitles in a format that can be hidden for those of us who speak english. thanks anyways for the upload, i guess.
