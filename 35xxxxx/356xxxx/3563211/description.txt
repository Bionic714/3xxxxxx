Color of Night (1994)

Psychologist Bill Capa gives up his practise when he unintentially pushes a patient to committ suicide. In an effort to come to terms with this tragedy he visits an old colleague, Bob Moore, who is subsequently murdered. The quest to catch the killer centres around a group of Moores psychologically disturbed patients, however equally as important is an affair which develops between Capa and the mysterious Rose. This relationship, at first a diversion, becomes central to the plot as the film progresses.
