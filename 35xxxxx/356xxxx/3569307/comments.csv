PLEASE SEED When you are done downloading it.

Ta.. Gary"
,PekkerCadette,2006-12-02T20:41Z,"""and the demand is rather surprising""  ...really? Is it? I don't think so...  Especially as You collected ""Pretty much everything he did"" into one torrent

Anywho...  Big thx!!!"
,speakeasy,2006-12-02T21:07Z,"Thanks.  A bit of feedback; people would much prefer it if you uploaded separate files, then they can decide which bits to download (or perhaps DL a single file to check quality).  And RARing is not a good thing . . . occasionally you'll find that these files are password protected (though I'm sure *you* wouldn't do this!)
Thanks again"
,hentooth,2006-12-02T21:30Z,"I HATE RAR's, but it was the easiest way to get all this ready for torrent, there are a LOT of files, and it would have taken AGES and AGES to do a torrent for each one"
,hentooth,2006-12-02T23:45Z,"PekkerCadette I can't belive how fast everyone jumped on this torrent, it is making it slow to download, but I will keep seeding until you all have the great mans masterpieces.

I REALLY hope you all enjoy it all as much as I did, it was in fact collected over about 5 years, there is a bit of duplication, but better more than none eh?

Gary"
,hentooth,2006-12-03T22:04Z,"KEEP Seeding peops, I am SO Chuffed so many of you seeded after downloading.

Makes me feel all warm inside, so I'll do more torrents like this"
,NinjaWanker,2006-12-17T16:21Z,Is it just me or are all the mp3s for the first hhg book broken?
,Herendil,2006-12-26T18:34Z,Ladda inte ner detta!!!!! BĂśckerna fungerar inte!!!!!!!
,hentooth,2006-12-27T16:20Z,"They all work fine here in winamp

Alla de fungerar fint hĂ¤r i segern ampere"
,lukinglas,2006-12-28T17:06Z,"i, too, am having issues with the first book
i tried wmp, itunes, winamp, and my mp3 player. none work.

if i do get that book to play correctly, i'll clean this all up and torrent it properly.

thanks for all the files, regardless!

-e :)"
,hentooth,2006-12-28T18:54Z,"If it comes to it, I'll reseed just the first book :)"
,hentooth,2006-12-28T19:16Z,"OK Guys, I just pulled book one from backups, and did a few simple tests on the first 4 episodes to make sure they so definately work.

I have reseeded it here http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3585476

It is the BBC radio play version"
,hentooth,2007-01-07T20:12Z,"If anyone gets ANY problems with ANY part of this torrent, let me know, and I will re-seed from a known good backup, but ""Every book don't work"" is rubbish, only had complaints from the first book so far"
,Herendil,2007-02-11T12:19Z,"Non of the Dirk Gently books work! I tried to play them in winamp, windows mediaplayer and my mp3 player and they dont work in any of them!"
,hentooth,2007-02-24T21:54Z,"A new torrent will be posted with Dirk Gently... Not sure what's happened here, but the backup is good anyway"
,zsadam,2007-02-25T01:20Z,"for me the most of it does not work.dirk gently books,HHG(99%of it),Life universe 6,7,8;Mostly harmless 01 of 8(horsepilefiles.com).I'm not the best user of PCs but winamp doesn't play them.Maybe it's my fault.If you(anyone) could help me I will thank you.Media player says i haven't got some modul.I don't know what should i do Please help!!!"
,fnordnase,2007-03-03T16:44Z,"CAVEAT DOWNLOADOR:

It would be great to have all of DNA's audio books in one package, but this isn't it. I agree with the other commenters, there's something wrong with most of the audio books:

* Most (all) of the books don't have the files named and numbered in any meaningful or consistent way. There are many duplicate files, truncated files and even missing parts from audio books.

* Dirk Gently I: half of the files have 0 bytes size.

* Dirk Gently II: all the files are normal size but filled with NULL bytes.

* HH 1: multiple copies of the same audio book, but most files are broken.

* HH 2: parts 6-8 are broken (nulled).

* HH 3: contains about 4 copies of this audio book in various states of completeness, but the ones formatted like ""douglas adams - Mostly Harmless (Xof8).mp3"" make a complete copy! yay!

* HH 4: most parts are garbled / missing

* HH 5: missing part 8/8

* Starship Titanic has lots of duplicate files, and still isn't complete (there's no complete file for part 4).

Hentooth, thanks for sharing, but next time please make sure that what you're sharing is actually useable. As it is, this torrent is 1GB of junk data. Well, HH3 is complete, but that's about it."
,hentooth,2007-03-31T01:15Z,"My Deepest apologies to all, the data came from a drive which recently went BANG, which is annoying, it was my largest drive, so not happy about that.

So I feel there was a large amount of coruption.

I DO have a working backup of these files, from BEFORE it went on the dodgy drive, so I WILL collate it to get single copies of GOOD files.

My Apologies, I never intended to upload a dud, I'd listened to these in my car on long journeys, so I knew the files to be good.

Gary"
,RPSeeker,2007-04-30T23:14Z,"Not recommendable. 
Corrupt files, parts missing and SERIOUSLY many duplicate. Not worth it size.
Recomends: http://www.sadena.com/hh/ for DNA fans. Original BBC series in 5 sets / 26 episodes."
,hentooth,2008-01-31T00:49Z,"Will everyone STOP seeding this, even me the uploader agrees it's broken, if you want working files , ask, but this is NOT GOOD

Look up thru the comments, it's after a disk crash, but I have good backups, if needed, I can reseed, but this one is NO GOOD.

And that's from the original Seeder, DO NOT DOWNLOAD, It's BROKEN"
,Onward,2009-06-28T18:22Z,"Well then, original seeder, please REMOVE the torrent!"
