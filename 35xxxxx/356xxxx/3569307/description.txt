All 5 Hitch Hikers books
Both Dirk Gently Books
SS Titanic

Some is the BBC radio show, some is Douglas Adams reading the book, some you have both to choose from.

The only thing missing is the compilation book put together after his death, hitchikng the galaxy one last time.. But it was mostly little unconnected snips.

This lot is NOT my ripping, it's what I've compiled from downloads over the last few years, so don't blame me for any bad quality you may find (I've managed to hear all of them right thru so far).
