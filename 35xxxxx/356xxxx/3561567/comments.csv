,infyrno676767,2011-11-19T06:45Z,"I hate keeping a seeding torrent up for too long, but this is going to take me two hours to download. I'm super happy to be downloading it and it sure as Hell beats the other discography missing 2-3 songs each album, but I am terribly disappointed that it is running so slow. So to help out I'm gonna seed this for a minimun of a month. Thanks 007jopa!!!"
