,HangLoose,2006-11-30T10:59Z,"Thank's too ! CD1 is bin/cue + all the rar-files, so i unmark samples and the CD1-rar-files, need only bin/cue (not possible to unmark that), now it's 2,26 GB (strange unmarked a lot, and it's only 0,01GB less). ! IF the seed start !. i think it's too lot of a mess in this upload, forget all."
