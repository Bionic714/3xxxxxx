Synopsis
From the acclaimed creators of Toy Story, The Incredibles and Finding Nemo comes a high-octane adventure comedy that shows life is about the journey, not the finish line. Hotshot rookie race car Lightning McQueen is living life in the fast lane until he hits a detour on his way to the most important race of his life. Stranded in Radiator Springs, a forgotten town on the old Route 66, he meets Sally, Mater, Doc Hudson and a variety of quirky characters who help him discover that there?s more to life than trophies and fame. Revved up with a sensational soundtrack and exciting bonus features, including the exclusive short movie Mater And The Ghostlight, Cars is full of freewheeling fun for everyone..
