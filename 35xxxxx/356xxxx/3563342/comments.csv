,Vulcan219,2012-06-24T18:35Z,"If you have any DVD and Clone DVD2 you can burn it to a DVD on a single disc. the Clone DVD2 can be set to burn it on any size DVD even if it is a 7 gig movie, it will burn it on a 4.7 gig DVD-R or R/W, as long as it is in DVD format or an iso loaded on a virtual drive and copied and burned from that.
