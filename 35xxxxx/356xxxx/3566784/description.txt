More Information

Review from Sequences magazine: There are albums that grab you by the throat to never let you go again. "Mountains" by Thom Brennan is one such an album. Steve Roach produced the music and than you can understand in what direction this CD goes. In my opinion, Brennan even goes beyond where Roach has gone before. It is extremely wonderful layered ambient music filled with very interesting sequencer-patterns and great sounds. Of course, it's not only the sounds which make the music but also the compositions. Brennan is one of the those composers who has the ability to create an haunting atmosphere which can capture the listener, making you want to listen to the music over and over again. Just take magical pieces like "Incense And Rain" and "Habu Valley" and you'll know what I mean. The last track contains a sequence surrounded by strings and bell-tones and is something more than 10 minutes long but it is so beautiful that, in my case, it may last for the whole album. The title track goes in the same direction, though also has some traces of Klaus Schulze. This album really opened by eyes (and ears) and belongs to the top recordings of New Age music.
