I found some info on this ebook here 
http://www.jonbarron.org/book/book-sign-up.php

By special arrangement with the publisher, we're still able to offer a free ebook download of the complete 2002 paperback edition of Jon Barron's natural health book which includes topics like cleansing and detoxification, anti-aging, heart health, how to strengthen your immune system, natural health alternatives to disease prevention, and much more.



    ?Jon Barron's central premise is ?your body has a blueprint for health.? It is incumbent upon us to optimize our overall health, allowing the body to perform the function it was designed to do ? repair itself. While the focus is on natural alternatives for disease prevention, Barron also delineates a course for reversing the symptoms of all major health problems/diseases faced today.

    Compiling information from doctors who have facilitated ?miracle cures,? Barron provides a thorough description of vitamins, health and diet, antioxidants, detoxification, and exercise, and in a chapter entitled, ?The Thought that Kills,? describes how our thoughts and emotions affect our health. Also offering direction for smart supplement shopping, Lessons from the Miracle Doctors is a valuable and practical natural and alternative health guide.""
