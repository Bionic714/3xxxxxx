Hope this will work.. or else i will have to throw my mp3 player away...

Thanks for the UP!"

The far superior 4.3 has been available for some time now,in fact its been around so long I think its probably their final build and it fixes ALL the annoyances of previous versions of Sonic Stage and the dreadful Connect. just download it from the Sony site or whatever."
,wollygog,2008-12-10T23:25Z,"SonicStage 4.3 is available for free from the Sony Europe site - Just Google SonicStage.  I just want to get rid of this crappy Media Manager that came with my Walkman - Sucks!! Ps Thanks for the tip Avuss ("",)"
