 one thing you should now is that you can't download an update from the site with the reg-key.. it will work to use it on the SoundSpectrum but the update you get is not an update, it's trial version.."

,made-of-technetium,2006-11-30T21:30Z,"I remember when this used to be a small free winamp only plugin that contained many of the features now in this platinum version. Only went looking for a long due update when I discovered it now costs.
Thank you Awweboy & The Pirate Bay"
