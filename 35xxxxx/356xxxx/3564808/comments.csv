Sorry about, it's just life."
,barbaz,2006-11-29T04:07Z,"My spoon is too big!

Heh.  Thanks for this one.  I've wanted to see more of his work for a long time."
,vladdygirl,2006-12-06T11:26Z,"Steve,

I was saddened to find this independent DVD ripped here. Don is one of my favorite artists in the world in part because he is purely, 100% independent. He refuses all commercial and corporate work and subsists entirely on the income from his work - largely DVD sales from his own online shop.

Torrent is cool and everything, but in cases like these they hurt the artist in a very direct and very real sense. This guy isn't rich. He isn't ""the man"". Torrents like these only serve to give people a reason not to legitimately purchase his work, which in turn hurts the chances of Don being able to produce future films for us.

Please consider removing this torrent and support this artist. His website is: www.bitterfilms.com"
,bertilbulle,2006-12-07T17:32Z,"I'll buy this, thank you very much."
,legacywarrior,2006-12-12T00:06Z,"Please seed as much as possible, I know it's pretty new and a lot of people want it but the more people that seed the faster everyone can have it too : ).  I would greatly appreciate it."
,legacywarrior,2006-12-14T18:58Z,"I am downloading this torrent as I speak and I am getting terrible speeds.  It is so close to being done if someone would seed this for just a few hours even I could have this download complete.  I promise I will seed for quite awhile after, heck I'm seeding right now as much as I can.  Please."
,natanaelcd,2007-01-12T23:49Z,"ItÂ´s not bad to share the work of this artist.

This give other people a chance to know the work of this guy, wich is GREAT!!!
And if you like, buy it if you can to suport him.

In my case is very hard to buy this, here in Brazil we have very small wages, and its hard to buy something in dollars."
,Black_Sage77721,2007-09-30T10:06Z,"I'm gonna buy it anyways once i get a few weeks pay and finances are up to an acceptable level, but for now i just want to enjoy some of his greatness"

It's worth noting that this is not nearly a complete rip of this DVD.  The disc itself is about twice as many gigs in size, with a couple hours of special features. Some of them are real interactive with animated menus, commentaries, making-of videos and things, so maybe a complete rip is impossible?  The DVD also came with a pretty cool booklet ;)"
,joynarc,2008-08-06T14:10Z,"The dvd is oop, so buying it is not an option. Also Hertzfeldt has said he doesn't care about financial considerations, just that internet bootlegs are usually shitty quality. Thanks for caring though."
,tellier,2009-04-20T02:50Z,"
Uh, Joynac, this DVD is definitely not out of print. Obviously you've never been to Don's website to check, or even attempt to purchase one.  Nice.

I'm pretty sure an indie artist who pays for every cartoon out of his pocket with no corporate backing would appreciate a little common sense support from his ""fans.""

Anyway, like I said this is still not nearly a complete rip of all the features on this DVD... honestly if you like these films, do yourself a favor and check out the real thing."
,Inferius,2009-09-30T20:27Z,"I wanted to purchase this DVD but on the website it says that it's an NTSC region DVD, and I'm in the UK. I'd happily buy it but if it's not available in PAL then I'm going to have to download this!"
,Elxzomin,2010-02-02T02:05Z,@acidtr1p I'm getting an average of 300 kbps right now and it shows no signs of slowing! xD Thanks for the upload! I love these cartoons.
,Lachend,2010-11-18T19:07Z,"Dld @ 700 kbs, nothing wrong with that.
You are right of course vladdy g. no use taking the dollars out of his pocket.
He makes beautifull shorts, and does so independant.
So I will write him an email to ask him what he thinks about being on the piratbay.
If I get an answer, I'll post it here.."
