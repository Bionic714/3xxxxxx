,Beach_Lover22,2008-03-08T03:25Z,I drove 1500 miles to see John Force and Ashley last June (2007) in Englishtown New Jersey and I have been looking for Videos of that National weekend and can't find any. If someone knows where I could find some would be much appreciated.
,Silverchris45,2008-10-23T12:07Z,"I'm the ONLY ONE seeder for few monthes.

I have a very low upload bandwith (15kb/second max) so alla my bandwith is reserved for drag racing fans (with the other torrent here : http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3394409/NHRA_Phoenix_2005_Dragracing  )

I notice that when a leecher had finished to download this great programm, he cuts his seed.
So, I'm fed up being the only one seeder.
Two leechers are not far from 100%. If they cut thier seed, I'll cut mine adn I'm not really sure there will be another seeder for a long time.

SEED PLEAZE ! "
