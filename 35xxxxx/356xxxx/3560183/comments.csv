This is a big saving on the $299.00 price they want from learnrv.com. Luky. Because  RV is totalally worthless and there are plenty of gullible people out there that would have wasted their money. so Raytracer deserves an extra big thankyou for this one.
This is a little about Major Ed Dames. 

Ed Dames was in charge of a U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency team of remote viewers. Now the head of his own remote viewing company called PSI TECH, he claims that his company's remote viewing findings are 100% accurate. One such finding, involving about ten remote viewers over a nine-month period, is that a plant pathogen placed by extraterrestrials in a cylinder or cylindrical area connected to the Hale-Bopp comet is headed toward Earth--more specifically, Africa--and over the next couple of years will spread and kill most of the world's plants, leading to mass starvation. He says that most of us who survive will be eating algae. His teams have also predicted for the Earth's central latitudes devastating winds of up to 300 miles per hour resulting from the jet stream coming down onto or near the Earth's surface, widespread genetic mutations and destructive micro-organisms resulting from ozone depletion and increased UV radiation, a bovine AIDS virus that will kill many infants who drink milk, and, by the summer of 1998, global economic collapse.
