from the site:
\\\\\\\"The Learn Remote Viewing DVD course, by Major Ed Dames, was built entirely from the ground up; utilizing the latest protocols and methods to provide the most effective and comprehensive training program in the world! The proof is in the results; read the students testimonials, or take a look in the official student forums where people just like you are effectively learning and using Remote Viewing on a daily basis. Be sure to also watch the video samples to help explain the RV process and witness a rare look in to a live training session! If that wasn\\\\\\\'t enough, you can even sign up for live training at the RV workshops!\\\\\\\"

enjoy!
