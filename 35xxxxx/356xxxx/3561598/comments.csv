,machbar,2006-12-28T06:10Z,"The 1.7gig file is 5 files. The film in two parts, an interview with Joel Bakan, the writer, and two small PDFs with info about the torrent, and C4CHR - Campaign for corporate harm reduction. 

We'll put it all up as separate files soon. Sorry about the big file. Wanted to keep the quality up."
