In all cases, these are best known copies currently available to online collectors. Unfortunately a few are at lower bitrate, but still watchable. If you have better copies, please share.  I am a huge McFly fan, stuck in America and unable to capture the new McFly appearances from UK TV. PLEASE SHARE if you are able to get new stuff as it happens, or if you happen to have older stuff that you can encode in good quality. Yay McFly!! We love 'em!!"
