You will see how this film influenced Douglas Adams' 'Hitch Hikers Guide to the Universe'.

A must have film for any sci fi fan......."

,aamaz,2008-12-14T01:59Z,"Thanks a bunch!  Didn't think I'd be able to find this old gem.  BTW, its not Alan Dean Foster's story, he adapted Dan O'Bannon & John Carpenter's script to write the novel."
