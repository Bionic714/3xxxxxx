,Vitiligo,2008-06-30T17:36Z,"I started playing EOB1 (awesome game, played it on Amiga 600 about 100 years ago) but having problems when saving. The game asks for EOBDATA.SAV and it says ""Insert disk 6 into any drive"". You can save the game, right? Otherwise no idea playing it.

Anyone knows what to do?"
,homelesman,2008-08-27T23:50Z,"ya just open notepad and save an empty document (no text, a file with nothing in it) namend CREATE.SAV into your EotB directory."
,Ba_76,2009-01-03T21:40Z,"Thanks for the tip Homelesman, but i am not sure how that works, i tried saving documents in several types now with wordpad but i still get the error message when i try to save or load ingame, its a real shame because i love these games.

Can you please explain to me how it is done exactly to save a game?, Thanks.

Cheers"

,jassoru,2012-03-30T07:15Z,"Just in case someone is downloading this - You need to create an empty file named EOBDATA.SAV in the game directory before mounting it in dosbox, or you will not be able to save."
