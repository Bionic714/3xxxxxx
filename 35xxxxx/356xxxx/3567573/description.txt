A-PDF Split is a very simple, lightning-quick desktop designed to split your PDF file. The program basically takes a large PDF file and extracts pieces of it based on the range selected by the user. The extracted pieces will be stored into a new file or files (if more than one piece extracted). If needed, you can recombine the generated split files with other pdf files using a utility such as A-PDF Merger to form new composite pdf files. A-PDF Split will even work with password-protected PDF files.
