Where can you get the Kore Sound Files (*.ksd)?
How do you seed?"
,mortbra,2007-02-17T23:24Z,For the sample library.. just download demo from native inst. install it . save the sample folder someplace. uninstall  then reinstall this version. just restart between instalations or it might bother you about registration
,jPandora,2007-04-18T21:21Z,Seed pleeeease!!!!
,muthaphaqer,2007-12-21T11:14Z,"Hey bru cifer , i got the same problem. What i did was, instead of reinstalling xp or absynth, i reinstall my sequencer which was ableton live. Any other ppl got tis problem n know a quick fix? thanks"
,drax12,2008-01-19T08:23Z,Has any one been able to modulate the master filter? I've had no luck in Cubase3 or Ableton.
,endotherm,2008-03-05T23:42Z,cannot find BIO_chord. Wtf is this 
,grammarye,2008-10-13T09:59Z,"@ endotherm and salazam:
Follow what mortbra says. Save the Samples folder from the downloaded demo from the official site.

Then when you start up the downloaded version again, go to File -> Options and select the location for where you have put the Samples folder. Voila, works."
,annalator,2008-11-30T10:44Z,"thanks for the up!

has anybody an idea why i cannot open the multiple rar archive with 7-zip?

(winrar works, of course)"
,ymmito,2008-12-14T06:22Z,"HELLO EVERYONE. NOW LISTEN UP!!!! ABSYNTH 4 IS BUILT WITH AN ANTI-PIRACY MECHANISM. THIS IS THE EFFECT - THIS (OR ANY OTHER CRACKED) COPY WILL WORK FINE FOR AROUND A MONTH AND FROM THEN ON WILL CRASH WHEN YOU TRY TO SELECT ANY TAB OTHER THAN THE PERFORMANCE SCREEN (WHICH IT OPENS ON). IT CLOSES IMMEDIATELEY AND ALSO CLOSES SOFTWARE YOUR ARE USING TO RUN IT (VST MODE), ABLETON, LOGIC, WHATEVER YOU USE.
DOESN'T DO ANY DAMAGE, IT JUST DOESN'T WORK
IT'S TRUE, LOOK IT UP"
,guy_wild,2008-12-18T23:48Z,"To ymmito:

I don't know why you're writing such horseshit, but I will tell you something many of us have discovered a long time ago: 

AiR have done a GREAT job in cracking this program. It does NOT self-destruct or in any other way stop working or closes your host.

I have used Absynth 4 since November 2007 and it always has amd still is working like a charm. Both the plug-in and the stand-alone version.

Either you have had the misfortune of getting something infected (that would suggest an AV update) or you are just full of it. In iether case your statement is totally erronous.

Peach"
,destys,2008-12-20T20:14Z,same problem with my absynth like ymmito sed.. crashes after 2-3 weeks.. ;( 
,hemi2050,2008-12-21T22:57Z,"Same problem here.  So I guess that rules out ""getting something infected"" or ""just full of it""."
,guy_wild,2008-12-23T13:20Z,"Well then...if it is so, can you explain why my copy still is working perfectly? 

And yes, it's the AiR release, 4.01. So either my previous statements stand, och chipxsd have altered this specific torrent in some way, for some reason.

I have honestly no clue, but I still think it's a very crappy pirate style to write posts like ymmito did."
,ymmito,2009-08-17T03:07Z,"hi guy_wild. 
yes i think i can explain why your copy is working. i am assuming that you have only been using the preset sounds and have not attempted to alter these or create new sounds as this is when the program crashes - ie when you select a tab other than the performance tab (as stated in my original post)

see. told you so :)

peace"
,kilsnar,2010-01-24T18:56Z,thx
,Deathrock_Sean,2010-02-08T09:51Z,"There are _always_ problems with Absynth. Had me Absynth 1, Absynth 2 and Absynth 3, and each of them had wonderful sound and awful behaviour.
The Absynth 4 now is no exception.

here are some files that are known to be ""missing"":
chord_BIO.wav
Engine_BIO.wav
Factory_BIO.wav
Flutex_BIO.wav
Harmonic Chime per_RD.wav
Claudius_BIO.wav
Alienate_BIO.wav
Moovie_BIO.wav
Purr_BIO.wav
My Mouth_BIO.wav
Tex morph_BOI.wav
... and many many more
what is there to do about it?"
,nick.kay83,2010-03-04T22:18Z,"Looks like I'm going to be buying Absynth 5, oh well, AiR have saved me a fortune already so no gripes. Time to dig into my pocket... I suggest everyone else does the same if you want to use Absynth to it's full capabilities."
,SaltSlasher,2011-02-24T20:54Z,"Well most of the NI stuff works, but it's hard to find all of them.
I am not sure of this, but I did the setup and everything, but to me it seems like this is just a demo version?
Is this the full program cracked?"
,Socomeagle,2011-09-25T20:35Z,"Work fine, great job, thanks!"
