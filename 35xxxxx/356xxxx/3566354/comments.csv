,tomtomx,2006-11-28T20:23Z,Usually Revised pukes on Fox News and questions their credibility. Guess he finally found something he liked and suddenly all his doubts regarding the source disappeared...
,tomtomx,2006-11-28T20:25Z,"Btw here's the without competition best 9/11 documentary so far. Loose change version 3 (with sane comments and exposing of disinformation in the previous two versions...)

,rus0,2006-12-04T16:18Z,"loose change was total bullshit. i thought it was legit, but then after i realized it seemed so far fetched, it actually was (look it up on wikipedia). 

and for those who think it's legit and good, i am a stern anti-bush liberal who is saying this right now. leaders of the 911-truth movement even rag on loose change.

and interestingly enough the station that FEATURED the entire Loose Change film on their network, was none other than FOX News, just so  they could then rip the film all apart, to discredit the entire 9/11 Truth movement.

If you believe the Bush administration had nothing to do with 911, you are an idiot. If you believe loose change 2nd or 1st edition is a good documentary, you are also an idiot.

Those who believe our government are the biggest idiots. 

Despite whatever anyone wants to say, a lot of our ""leaders"" and so-called ""officials"" are in little cult activity together at the Bohemian Grove, doing fucked up rituals and doing mock-sacrifices of children, in their fucked up cult, strongly related to the Skull and Bones shit at Yale that Bush and Kerry are both in. 

They fucking refuse to talk about what they do at the bohemian grove, but there is footage of what they do and it is FUCKED. 

Everyone needs to take a look at that.

And don't use a defense that it is a theatrical presentation of some kind, because if that is true, I want to know why there is so much secrecy and why exactly our world leaders are so dependent on a little group of other men... they are supposed to be MEN not KIDS.

And if you don't know what I am talking about, and think I am crazy, consider seeing the film
Martial Law 9/11 by Alex Jones. 

That is by far the best 9/11 documentary out there. HE is a good american because HE actually takes risks to see what the fuck are fucked up government is up to. 

Republicans & Democrats are practically the same. They both answer to lobbyists. They both are in this fucking cult. 

But the last thing the 9/11 Truth movements needs, is a bunch of kids making a documentary like Loose Change and fucking it all up. It takes credibility away from the truth, and makes the stupid fucking people in this country (u know, the ones who voted for President Bush in 2004) all confused so they don't know what to do.

But when you think of it, nothing really matters I guess, because Global Warming will destroy us, and we all sit by allow ExxonMobil to lobby our congress and president and prevent anything from being done. 

Keep on ignoring the environment America, and you will get what is coming to you... and bring us all down with you."
