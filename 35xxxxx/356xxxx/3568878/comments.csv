When does number 12 come ?"
,freeloader,2006-12-06T17:06Z,"According to a CBS press release, Jericho will air repeat-free in this, its freshman season, albeit with a hitch: The drama will take a 10-week breather after staging a cliff-hanger finale on Nov. 29, then return with all-new (and nothing but new) episodes on Feb. 21, 2007, starting with a flashback to how life was in Jericho pre-nuclear attack. During the hiatus, fans can find new, Jericho-related content at CBS.com, and streamings of episodes aired to date at Innertube.

Filling Jericho's Wednesdays-at-8 time slot during the month of December will be double helpings of The King of Queens, which premieres its ninth season on Dec. 6. As for what happens come January, when the King scales back to single-episode outings, CBS says an announcement will be made at a later date.

Another part of the TV.com website says..

""Jericho is scheduled to return to the CBS schedule with a ""recap episode"" on Feb. 14 followed by an uninterrupted string of new episodes beginning February 21.""


Så med andra ord tyvär vi får vänta tills 21 Februari men då kommer dom spela alla avsnitt utan avbrott :)"
