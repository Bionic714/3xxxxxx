And please leave your comment here so that everybody knows what they are about to download. Many people (like me) don't have a decent connection, and it really hurts to find out that what took 7-8 days(nights) to download is either defected or just rubbish. I am sceptical because this has already happened with me many times. (eg: t3dgm by""makna"" tracked by tpb)"
,anpe91,2006-12-02T15:36Z,"Shuld work fine.. and its not crap according to me..
This clip shows how to make a game using this program, and how easy it is: http://t3dgm.thegamecreators.com/?f=promo"
,Rcco3,2006-12-03T09:23Z,"I have restored the software to its original version.I run the software,and when i choose a scene or a player,nothing appears,the screen to the right has no texture.Help!!!"
,Rcco3,2006-12-03T09:39Z,This is pure crap.Where have those little textures gone? What should I do? Download it again or reinstall? Come on...People should check if everything works right on a different computer!!!
,Nabarun,2006-12-03T19:34Z,"Well, the upload is O.K. I have successfully installed and tested it. Thanks to bulldog_466.

But this software is really not meant for the ones who have ever played games equal to or better in quality than, say, quake 1.

By ""Quality"" I mean the visual quality, gui, controls, sound/music, ai, gameplay,...etc.etc.

Anything which makes a game attractive/addictive is absent from the ones created by this one.

And by the way, it displays a logo and message in fullscreen in the compiled exe's, saying that it has been created using t3dgm, and the game is supposed to be free.

Whether it is ""crap"" or not is a matter of personal taste. I think children about the age of 5-6 may like it."
,Rcco3,2006-12-03T20:51Z,"Could you please tell me in detail how did you cracked it,I mean that thing about returning the game to original version?When I launch the software I for example go to create player.I chosed an object and the screen to the right is blank.I choose the scene,test the game and everything is black! Heeeelp!!!"
,Rcco3,2006-12-03T21:53Z,"How stupid I am!!! Say,where can you find this patch for the Windows XP users (that was the problem...) to make this software work correctly?"

If you KNOW how to use it well then you can make much better games with mugh higher quality than ""Quake 1."" You probably had no clue how to use it."
