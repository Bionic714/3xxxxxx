,hutchwilco,2007-05-22T12:17Z,"Wondering if someone can explain this for me :
I have downloaded 99.24% of this torrent and with 50 peers, suddenly all downloading stops, occasionally I'm uploading, but why has the peering stopped so abruptly (and at such a terrible percentage!) seems like a conspiracy against me!
There are still 50 peers listed, though none are uploading..."
,darkseedarts,2007-07-03T02:49Z,Not enough source and too many Leechers
,zmibbe,2007-08-12T22:05Z,"How's the quality? I don't know understand what 'cropping' means, sorry."

,HooglyBoogly,2007-09-22T16:25Z,"I threw all of these into an .ISO and burned it, but it won't play in my DVD player. I've done this a million times already, so I don't see what the problem is. Anybody care to help?

,synchro_w,2007-11-03T23:08Z,"this sounds fucked up and lame. don't upload crap. if half the eps don't work or aren't there then it's not really season2, is it?

,SRC1022,2007-11-30T09:30Z,"Uhh, Episodes 12 and 13 are different.  Episodes 7, 10, and 14 work perfectly fine for me.  I'm using VLC.  

Maybe that guy's computer sucks, but for me everything works perfectly fine."
,djhotwheel,2008-01-15T04:39Z," Hey numbnutz....
My files work fine on my end. All my episodes are in order. These were encoded on a Mac some in MP4 format. You may need a codec to get them working. Since this post the DVDs are out now."
,namtaru,2008-06-02T10:21Z,"All episodes play just fine in VLC. I love the unedited intro/exits with adult swim commentary, makes this a nice unique download. There's a funny little message about piracy in episode 15..."

,AcexMace,2009-06-30T13:02Z,Seed please?
,max2562,2009-07-07T01:48Z,amazing how many retards blame something/someone else for their own stupidity... if you are having problems with video/audio then most likely it's YOUR problem. try researching a little before you go bashing an uploader... if you don't know wtf to do then you can start with finding codecs that work. if not then go climb a tree or something... 
,arjay2277,2009-09-20T12:36Z,Skyster23 try it on vlc media player it has loads of pre installed codecs for formats that media player won't play. Has this got the six flags guy in it?
,arjay2277,2009-09-20T14:08Z,"Brilliant torrent, downloaded at 1.5mbps done in about 15 minutes!!
Cheers for the upload."
,Interscape,2011-02-23T01:55Z,"Thanks, this torrent works and the quality is pretty good. If anyone says it has a virus, they are tards. Thanks for the upload DJHotwheel :)"
