,DVDguy,2006-12-02T17:10Z,Curious how the commentaries work.  Are they part of the film .avi????  Sorry if it's a stupid question.
,PhoeniX726,2006-12-03T03:36Z,In Media Player Classic for example you can choose an alternate audio track by going to Play > Audio.

,Jappe,2006-12-17T11:45Z,Quality was pretty crappy on those movies which were ~700 MiB. Becouse most of them are over 2 hours movies.
,vh14a,2006-12-17T19:31Z,"Don't bother downloading this torrent, on the main movies the audio is way(were talking like 10 seconds) out of sync and quality is bad. all the other comentary is ok but I think most of us probably would like to WATCH THE MOVIE....."
,PhoeniX726,2006-12-18T02:29Z,"jappe, if i was to encode at 1.37gb the torrent would almost double in size..

,tandrej,2006-12-21T10:20Z,"Hi. I have downloaded all the movies, but there is something wrong whit the sound. When i play the movie, in all og the films, it seems like there more sounds layed on the film, so when like  f.ex. pierce is talking, i can also hear someone else talk. Is there something wrong whit the sound, or is it me that have done something wrong here ?? Thanks anyway...."
,PhoeniX726,2006-12-21T16:21Z,that would be your player trying to play both the commentary and the regular audio at once.. try different media players like MPClassic or BSPlayer and see if that solves the problem.
,rodude58,2006-12-22T04:07Z,"I downloaded all the 1999 World is Not enough movie files.  However, the AVI file for the main movie the one thats 1.35GB big plays only for about 19 seconds.  Do you know why that is? Even on the little timer at the bottom of the player, it says theres only 16 seconds of Video Clip.  Am I missing something?  Can someone please help:?????"
,bones228,2006-12-23T20:59Z,rodude58 i had same problem 8-11 seconds of play . i use real player and it dont work . so use nero to play and x convert to dvd to burn all will be fine buddy . hope it helps .

,DVDguy,2006-12-25T04:16Z,"Ok, update.  After 22+ days, this d/l is complete.  I burn my .avi files to DVD-R and play them on my Philips 5140 DVD Player.

Haven't taken the time to watch every frame naturally.. but am almost done burning everything.

No Sync issues so far.  Haven't seen any encoding concerns so far with the films longer than 2hours... but as stated, haven't watched everything completely yet.

The second audio channel (commentary) works on my player... which is a surprise.

Ok... problem so far.  Just burn Goldeneye Tomorrow Never Dies Films.  Says that Video Resolution is not supported.  So can't play them on my stand alone.  Doesn't happen with any filme before that.... nor the extras so far.

Ok... same problem with the final two features ... world and die.  ""Video resolution is not supported"".  Extras seem fine.  The last four features will NOT play in the Philips machine.

That could be a problem for some."
,atari1234,2006-12-26T03:11Z,"Hey, I have been downloading this for a while and just opened up Dr. No once it finished and it only plays about 12 seconds of the film. 

I read the posts above and see that bones228 said to open it in nero, but I don't have nero and would really prefer to use windows media player to watch them since I hook my laptop up to my tv and watch them that way. So I was wondering if there are any kind of codecs that might be needed to watch these in windows media player?

Thanks"
,DVDguy,2006-12-26T20:22Z,atari1234 :  Have you tried VLC Media Player??  Sweet software... and free.  Might help your current situation.
,atari1234,2006-12-26T21:27Z,"Yeah, I had VLC a little while ago, but didnt like how it worked. I would much rather use windows media player. I have a remote for my laptop that only works with windows media player as well. I cant make it compatible with VLC either so thats why I would prefer WMP.

There has to be some kind of codec out there that fixes my problem, I have been searching, but havent had much luck so far."
,DVDguy,2006-12-27T04:41Z,"atari1234 :  Sorry mate, can't help.  I just burn everything to DVDR and watch them on TV.  I get free DVDR from work, and my cheap Philips works great most of the time...  good luck."

Casino Royale has been the production name of now three James Bond Productions.  and the original James Bond debut was in a British prime time television show titled Casino Royale in the year of our lord 1954.

,MaximilianSeptillion,2008-01-04T20:14Z,Is there anyway we can speed this up?  
,MaximilianSeptillion,2008-01-06T16:26Z,"Finally got a couple of whole films downloaded, and although this torrent is strictly for the connoisseur of James Bond, it isn't for me.  All the films have commentaries--just like he says. Audio commentaries on every movie--non of the movies are just movies.  Download at your understanding that there are NO JUST MOVIES in this download.

Thanks Phoenix, but no thanks.  I should have read it better.  It took a lot of work to package this though.  You must really be into James Bond dude.  Take care."
,PhoeniX726,2008-01-07T15:01Z,"Maximillian, it's not just commentaries.. you need a media player that can choose between the two.. such as Media Player Classic"
,PhoeniX726,2008-01-07T15:11Z,"I probably shouldn't do encodes with commentaries next time.. as it seems so many people are either incompetent at using their PC or are running incompetent software/codecs.. ALL of these video files work FINE on both MPC and VLC when I tested them.

To all those who had constructive criticism or managed to get it working and took the time to say thanks.. Thanks back, it means a lot"
,PhoeniX726,2008-01-07T15:20Z,"The incompetent comment was mainly aimed at people who just flatly say ""omg this torrent is crap THE COMMENTARY IS ALL YOU HEAR!!!!!!!!!!!""

Maximilian, hope you haven't deleted what you downloaded because there are ways around it :P 

Honestly, the encodes have both commentary AND regular audio.. you just need a GOOD player to be able to choose between the two. Even then, when I play them, the main movie audio track plays first, and not the commentary. The only thing I can put it down to is bad codecs and crappy players. Although AFAIK Windows Media Player doesn't have the ability to change between audio tracks, VLC and MPC do.. and I assume BS player does also.

This is IMO the most comprehensive Bond torrent on the web, just a shame not everyone can enjoy it.. perhaps I should've been clearer when I said ""Audio commentaries on every movie""? I guess not everyone has heard of dual audio before -_-"
,MaximilianSeptillion,2008-01-08T00:48Z,"Thanks for the heads up on the commentaries, but unfortunately I did delete the torrent--I should have come back here first.  At any rate, I am a bit green with knowing good players from not so good ones.  I do not know what VLC and MPC are, nor what AFAIK is, but I do have media player.  I tried it on my DVD Cyberlink, and I wasn't able to switch to an audio without commentary.  I think Cyberlink is a run of the mill any way.  Email me if you want at maximilian.septillion@yahoo.com  with some ideas on a good player.  Thank for torrent--I'd like to have it if it will play.  Thanks."
,PhoeniX726,2008-01-08T06:27Z,"MPC = Media Player Classic (select the audio by going Play -> Audio -> Track 1)
VLC = Video Lan Client (select the audio by going Audio -> Audio Track -> Track 1)
AFAIK = as far as i know :D

outside of that, cant confirm which players have the capability of playing dual audio.. nor am i sure which and how the AVI -> DVD programs like nerovision and dvdsanta are capable of choosing the right audio track when converting for use on your DVD player."

,karnabk,2008-01-14T01:48Z,"This is for uploader (PhoeniX726). Well, after 12days straight downloading, I finished all the movies and two documentries. Usually, I put the movies in DVD(if they are in .avi format) and then watch in HDTV. There is something wrong with the movies .avi files. They don't play in my Samsung DVD(DivX)player nor they play in my Philips DVD (DivX) player. I get the sound in my Phillips though. But the two documentaries that I downloaded played fine. 

About playing in PC, they play fine using either of VLC or Media Player. So, I would like to know what is wrong with the Movie files. If movies and documetaries are ripped from the same source, how come one plays and the other don't. 

I hope someone can answer me. It took me so much time to download. If the avi movie files don't play in my DVD, I will have to burn each individual movie into DVD. 

Thanks in advance. "

,jsmooth22,2008-04-23T00:18Z,"It's really easy to get rid of the commentaries if you don't want them.  use VirtualDubMod.  Follow these steps.

1. Download VirtualDubMod, it's free.  you can find it at sourceforge.net or just simply type in google download virtualdubmod.
2. extract the program, and just double click the one that says auxsetup
3. After VirtualDubMod is up and running, click file, open vido file....select the Bond Movie you would like to disable commentaries on.
4.  go to streams, then click stream list.  there will be two audio channels or sometimes 3 depending on the movie, simply disable all audio files except the first one on each movie and then click ok.  The first audio file is the actual movie.  the second and sometimes third are the commentaries.
5. Click on video, then click direct stream coping
6. click file, then save as, and name the movie whatever you would like.  It just gives u the same movie minus the commentaries.

THIS IS NOT AS HARD AS I MADE IT SOUND.  IT'S REALLY EASY AND THE CONVERSION TAKES ABOUT 2 MINUTES.  I HOPE THIS HELPS ALL WHO WANTED TO TAKE THE COMMENTARIES OFF OF THE MOVIE.  ENJOY MY FRIENDS.!!!

This movie is just a remake of Thunderball, so if you are going to watch them movies Chronologically on a timeline, whatch it before or after Thunderball I guess.  Thunderball is the canon film version of Ian Flemings story, While Never Say Never Again is closer to an adaptation of the flick."

The Movies thenselves are Virtually unwatchable.  The video quality is excellent, but the audio tracks - as the torrent description says - have ALL the commentary tracks all going at once.  It's a cacophanous mess.  Maybe a devoted DVD player like powerdvd or something that lets you select the tracks can be used - but a standard player like windows media player or Media Center is useless...

Just be aware..."

,ilcapoditutticapi,2008-09-23T11:06Z,"If you are a newbee in this world, just as I was a month ago, you may be helped to know some ways to get a nice DVD.

1. Superb
An ISO file. This is an exact bit by bit copy of the original DVD (an it has the same size, so a lot of downloading).
The handling is very simple: use Nero, backup's, burn an image (that's the ISO file) to disc. Done? Then you have a DVD with all menus, subtitles and spoken languages.

2. Very good
Not so difficult at all, you have just to know. Make a directory (like MOVIE-XXX) with two subdirectories: one AUDIO_TS (leave it complete empty) and one VIDEO_TS (put all te files in it). Usually VOB (Video OBject ? the movie itself), IFO (InFOrmation like audio & subtitle info) BUP (BackUP ? reserve IFO). Remark: names of subdirectories must be in CAPITALS. Run DVD Shrink, point to the directory MOVIE-XXX), select backup and you have the complete DVD with all adds.

3. Good
Often you get DIVX files. The size about 800 Mb gives an idea of low resolution. Nope, it means very good compression. Import in in Nero and it explodes to 4.5 Gb of good quality. However after a succesfull burning session: no subtitles. Play it at your PC, no subtitles. Often you get a small file with a RAR extension. First find the WINRAR software. Not at a commercial site (only 30 day usage or so), just with ThePiratebay or Isohunt. WINRAR is like ZIP, a packing/compressing program. Unpacking gives you two files, one .sub and one .idx. Both must have the same name as the video file an must be in the same directory. So Movie.avi, Movie.sub and Movie.idx in one dir. Now you have subtitles when playing the movie at your PC. Still not on DVD. If your lucky, the seeder gave you a .srt
Must be in the same dir as the avi (give it the same name as the .avi, just to be sure). Don't use Nero, however ConvertXtoDVD. First download this from Piratbay/Isohunt (else you get an nice logo ""buy this software"" in your movie). Point ConvertXtoDVD to the appropriate directory and burn. You get a kind of menu when playing the DVD at your TV to make choices for spoken and subtitle languages.
Waouw, mustn't get worse! 
If didn't get a .srt file, you may find it at opensubtitles. Be aware: sometimes it is not sunchronized with your movie. The more the file name looks like your avi filename, the bigger the chance it is in sync.

4. Improve your knowledge of the spoken English

5. Forget all other types of files, takes a lot of time, offers only a bad mood.

Tip: buy an rewritable DVD, experiment, if the result is satisfying, make a diskcopy with Nero.

Software
Nero - use version 7, performs everthing, not heavely protected like version 8.
RAR - kind of packing software like ZIP
Vobsub - display subtitles when playing at your PC (run it once, kind of codex add-on to your mediaplayer)
DVD Shrink
ConvertXtoDVD - very usefull tool to get subtitles into your movie

Sites
www.thepiratebay.com torrents, movies, software
www.isohunt.com like the pirate bay
www.afterdawn.org loads of information how to burn, convert, and so on
www.opensubtitles.org to get subtitles in case the seeder did not enclosed it

,Dactylion,2008-10-17T06:00Z,"..::;;Important note;;::..
For those of you who don't want any of the extra stuff ( commentary, documentaries, trailers, music videos, interviews, trailers, deleted scenes, or animated storyboards).

This works for uTorrent and BitTorrent for sure, I don't know about any other program.

After you choose which program you want to download this with, it tells you what files you are getting. There are 20 folders or so. Go through each and uncheck the little boxes next to each and every file you don't want. The largest file in each folder is the actual movie, it is usually 690+ MB. This puts the total download from 27.55 GiB to about 16.6, which speeds up the process a whole lot.

And please. Please. PLEASE seed when you finish. Don't be an asshole. You just screw over the rest of us. The more that seed, the faster we all get done."
,Dactylion,2008-10-17T06:06Z,"Seriously though, when you finish, SEED.

99 seeders and 1,845 leechers is just bad. There should be way more seeders and way less leechers for a file of this size.

My PC is especially terrible at downloading things so I, along with many others, wish that at least some of you 1,845 assholes would please seed."
,ducati989,2008-10-17T16:00Z,"Have an OC-3 (155Mbps) working on this torrent now. A lot of users should see a significant speed increase once it's done and seeding, but even with a fat pipe its a slow torrent download and may take a day or so to be seeding. Will be letting full bandwidth out during non business hours (USA Daytime) and limiting it to 20mbps during the day as it's a daily used corporate line."

,truthy,2008-12-07T17:29Z,"ok first of all thx alot for this upload, very fast too, took me 1d 11h to download (16,53 GB for just all the Movies)

the quality of all the 'old' ones 1-16 is not that great but still very good for a bitrate arround 500-700 kb mostly 2 or 3 audios and just 700 mb per file. these ones are standalone compatbile to.

as for the 'newer' ones 17-20 the quality is very good but the resolution (960x400) isn't standalone (pal) compatible - I'm gonna reencode them to 720x400 and set the display AR to 2.35:1 this way the picture is still bigger than a normal dvdrip but the quality is better.

awesome all the 20 movies from this release + casino royale fit on 2 DVD-9 discs (no dvdrip for a quantum of solace yet) "

Then select the audio stream you want from source audio in the audio menu. 

If it plays in Virtual dub with the soundtrack of the movie, you've got the right one!!

Then go to the video menu, select compression(else, you'll have an enourmous file), if XVID doesn't show in the list, download and install the Mega codec pack(then restart vitual dub if needed). Then save as avi under the file menu! "
