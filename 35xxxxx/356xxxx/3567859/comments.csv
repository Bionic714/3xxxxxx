,Sinnersfury,2006-11-30T21:16Z,"No worries Kostaz, the site has had some trouble for a little while now updating seeders/leechers correctly, most torrents show inaccurate numbers. So... relax, let it load in whatever speed it does and enjoy a good book or something in the meanwhile ;)"

It works, Thanks! :)

,Azlyne,2008-03-03T00:52Z,"How do I get the game running? I downloaded the torrrent which led to me to download it from Limewire. How do I open it? When I double click it after it has finished downloading from Limewire, it asks me to choose what program to open it with. Can anyone help me?"
,roketjack,2008-03-28T03:39Z,"For keygen: http://www.keygen.ws/serials/e/8/

It's down it that list somewhere, worked first time for me, people who saying they cant find a working key, this took me 2 mins to find."
,roketjack,2008-03-28T11:05Z,"Azlyne

Get MagicISO, and mount the NRG file in that. THat will work.

Allthough it is installed for me, I can't actually get the game to start."
,roketjack,2008-03-28T11:24Z,"Right, here are instructions on how to play:

1. Download
2. Use MagicISO to mount the NRG file.
3. Use http://www.keygen.ws/serials/e/8/ to find a working keygen, and install using that key.
4. Go to the CD in 'My Computer'.
5. Copy from the crack file both .exe apps, to the Emperor directory. eg:C:\Sierra\EmperorRotMK
6. Copy the 'Emperor.exe' file to the desktop and start menu folders. 
7. Run.
8. Enjoy."

,...NIX...,2008-12-18T18:29Z,"I have tried Daemon tools, and Alcohol 52%, yet when I use ""Explore"" to view the contents of the Nero file, and try to right click on the ""Emperor"" Crack file to copy it, it says windows explorer has stopped working, and must restart. Is this because I'm using Vista? Help pls."
,NxiGo,2009-04-09T23:52Z,"'MMMJ_PJ' should have uninstalled his 'Emperor: Battle for dune' before installing 'Emperor ROTMK' or should have installed it to a different path.

Anyone tried applying 'Patch 1.0.1.0' with this Emperor CD?

The game gets corrupted when I apply the patch for me."
