From the back alleys of Nexus to the hectic thoroughfares of the Imperial City, from the wide avenues of Yu-Shan to the twisting corridors of the Labyrinth, martial artists of all kinds stride the mean streets of the Exalted world, living their lives by esoteric codes of honor and neither offering nor accepting quarter from their enemies. Will the return of the Solar Exalted throw the Martial Arts World into chaos, or will that culture?s Sidereal masters rein in the Lawgivers or put them down permanently?

? Details on the Martial Arts World, a warrior culture that spans Creation

? More than 25 supernatural martial arts styles, ranging from the simplest Terrestrial styles to the inscrutable Sidereal fighting arts
