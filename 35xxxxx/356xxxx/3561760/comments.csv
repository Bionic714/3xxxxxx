,Dark_Matter_01,2006-12-16T16:37Z,"hey frankiepankie....

Errrrr.....  it's not the tool, it's the user.  The tools, no matter how powerful they may be, are only as good as the hand that wields them.  

If you have to ask, you don't know enough about it to try using them.  And you'd be better off trying to use your skript-kiddie talents playing Doom or Solitaire."

[V],Nightwalker05,2007-01-11T22:20Z,"Thanks a for that Anacho!
frankiepankie; I know your probably looking for a ""quick solution"" to something, but I do encourage people to learn, hence why I supplied the website address with each application. Each website offers extensive documentation (and usually support) for their applications. I also gave you a head-start by giving you a handy description for each tool. Good luck and I hope you have fun learning about wireless networking!"

!cambot you are stupid, are you still running windows 95? I admit I am a noobie at this, but not going to make dumb remarks.,  We have one unsecured wireless already in our neighborhood, but he may wise up. "
