           -== War-Driver's Essential Toolkit ==-


:: Introduction ::
                    - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_driving

"Wardriving is searching for Wi-Fi wireless networks by moving
vehicle. It involves using a car or truck and a Wi-Fi-equipped
computer, such as a laptop or a PDA, to detect the networks."

I have been Wardriving for a few years now and over time I
have gathered more tools and equipment. Through use and
experience I bring you this first toolkit release that I have
gathered together and consider to be a good essential package
for every War-Driver to have in their arsenal.

I provide you with tools to detect, analyse, hack and even
secure yourself and your data.

I am mostly a Windows user; so all the tools here are for
Windows XP. Some of the best hardc0re wifi tools run on
Linux & other OS's, however they generally require a lot more
technical know-how, and thats not what this toolkit is about.
But if you do like Linux and like to dable I recommend learning
about Kismet and other wifi linux apps out there.

All software provided in this package is freely avaliable
on the internet, there are no cracks, serials or warez here,
Just quality freeware utilities.

 -== dpl.html ==- http://www.phenoelit.de/dpl/dpl.html

The War-Driver's must have! Default Password List.. this is a
list of default usernames and passwords that manufactorurs
give their routers. A good war driver will memorise the easy,
default ones for popular brands.



-== eraser53.zip ==- http://www.tolvanen.com/eraser/

Good for security, this handy little tool adds a "Erase"
function to your right click menu. Simply right click on
file(s) or folders and select erase to have files securly
scrubbed from your hard disk.



 -== Ethereal v.0.10.14 ==- http://www.ethereal.com/

Ethereal is a powerful packet sniffer. Here is their website's
spiel: "Ethereal┬« is used by network professionals around the
world for troubleshooting, analysis, software and protocol
development, and education. It has all of the standard features 
you would expect in a protocol analyzer, and several features
not seen in any other product. Its open source license allows
talented experts in the networking community to add enhancements.
It runs on all popular computing platforms, including Unix, Linux,
and Windows."



-== superscan4 ==-
 
http://www.foundstone.com/resources/proddesc/superscan4.htm

"Powerful TCP port scanner, pinger, resolver."



-== Tor ==- http://tor.eff.org/

Tor allows you to utilise a special network to allow you to
browse the web with true anonimity.

"Using Tor can help you anonymize web browsing and publishing,
instant messaging, IRC, SSH, and other applications that use
the TCP protocol. Tor also provides a platform on which software
developers can build new applications with built-in anonymity,
safety, and privacy features."



-== klitekpp241e.exe ==-

A version of Kazaa Lite that in the past has proven itself
to be useful to me. The installation is free of viruses or spyware
and the network still works, so I consider it to be one of the
best kazaa network apps.



-== lalsetup250.exe ==- http://www.lookatlan.com/

Another essential part of the War-Driver's kit; Look@LAN is a
superb freeware application for monitoring networks easily.
It offers an entire suite of very handy intergrated tools that
make life easy and do a lot of the work for you quickly.

Just on opening the application it will do a full port-scan
of your active network interface, it will alert you off changes
to the network, nodes coming online or offline etc. Simply
double-clicking a online node will scan the system for ports and
open services, its truly superb. Heres the company spiel:

"While Look@LAN lets you be able to entirely monitor a complex
and wide network, with Medas VNS (Visual Network Statistics) you
can keep under control your network primary nodes, such as routers,
firewalls, NATs, switches, HUBs. Medas VNS gives you detailed
statistics about any node that supports SNMP: network interface
stastics and correlated analysis, protocol statistics about any
TCP/IP layer, active TCP and UDP connections and services, TCP/IP
networks list, routes list. This is a perfect software solution for
anyone who wants to carefully monitor and manage a network by
keeping under strict control its primary nodes."


-== macshift.zip ==- http://devices.natetrue.com/macshift/

"The definitive free command-line MAC changing utility for Windows XP"
This is one of few applications that will effectively and quickly
change the hardware MAC code of your WiFi network card. It is a 
command line application for WinXP. Learn how it works, its switches
and then make batch scripts to execute all the commands for you when
you need them.

For example; on my War-Driving system I have a file on my desktop
name: "macshift.bat" that contains the following text:

cd C:\Windows\system32\

macshift -i "Wireless Network Connection"

exit



-== NetStumbler ==- http://www.netstumbler.com/

"NetStumbler is a tool for Windows that allows you to detect
Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs) using 802.11b, 802.11a and
802.11g."

Another essential for the War-Drivers Toolkit, this application
is nice and easy to introduce you novice's to the game. Great
handy free app for detecting wifi networks, still gets used by
me every time :)



-== Port Scanner.exe ==- http://www.radmin.com/

A dedicated free application for port scanning. A good all-round
port scanner with nifty features etc.



-== truecrypt-4.1.zip ==- http://www.truecrypt.org/

"Free open-source disk encryption software for Windows XP/2000/2003
and Linux" This free open-source software is superb for data
encryption and security. It takes a little learning but you can soon
be encrypting whole disks, partitions or volumes. It supports
on-the-fly encryption which (once auth'd) you can drag and drop data
onto a drive and it will encrypt the data for you.

You can choose your own strength and algorithm of encryption.

You can even create hidden encrypted volumes, so not only would
someone not be able to break the encryption, but it would be imposible
for them to tell if there was even encrypted data on the system at all.
