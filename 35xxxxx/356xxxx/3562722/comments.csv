,DetCochese,2007-02-21T06:08Z,"This is in a bunch of .rar parts. I unzipped them all at once and they are now an .iso file 1243MB in size. This is obviously too big for a CD-R.

How do I burn it? Does it have to be seperated into two discs? How do I do that?"
,geving,2007-03-08T13:59Z,"DetCochese: Ever heard of a DVD-R disc?!
Lots of software comes on DVD nowadays..
People don't like changing $media several times during an install..."
,ThWar,2007-04-05T18:58Z,"LOL! Get With the Times ALL of YOU!

CD/DVD Burning is for LaMeRz! 

Get a Virtual CD from SlySoft.com... 

I've been using it for quite a while now!  and the Best thing is that it's FREE!!!!

Just mount the CD/DVD iMaGe, and install works Great for everything!  And you Never HaFTa Uze See-Deez or Dee-Vee-Deez Again!  Keep all the images on your HD!
