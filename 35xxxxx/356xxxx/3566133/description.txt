Methadonia

For more than 30 years, methadone has been used to treat heroin addiction. But when mixed with other substances, such as benzodiazopenes, the treatment can be as harmful as the heroin itself. METHADONIA exposes the problems of treating heroin addiction with legal methadone.

METHADONIA is the borderland between high and straight, where recovering heroin addicts on methadone "maintenance" exist. Passing the time on benzos and other prescription drugs that enhance the methadone, addicts find themselves in Methadonia for years, or decades. Selected for the prestigious New York Film Festival and featured on HBO, this unflinching, intimate film reveals the culture of addiction through the eyes and lives of men and women stuck in Methadonia, holding on to the hope they will wake up one morning and not think about getting high.
