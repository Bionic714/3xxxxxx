,X,2006-11-27T06:20Z,"Yes there are ! You can dl SP2 x64 RELEASE CANDIDATE from MS Downloadcenter ! I've run it, but it was unstable and a bit buggy..."
,X,2006-11-27T06:28Z,"You can find sp here:

,txman4462,2006-11-27T06:51Z,that is SERVER 2003 not win xp pro 64
,txman4462,2006-11-27T06:55Z,actulaay designed for server 2003 but will work on win xp pro 64.......when windows update releases an updat for win xp pro 64 specifically then i'll call it sp2...:)
,andbir,2006-11-27T09:14Z,"Well as I explained in the torrent description this is WinXP x64 edition and not W2003, whatever the filename says."
,andbir,2006-11-27T09:15Z,and this is not from windows update.... to post something here from there would be totally lame
,andbir,2006-11-27T09:19Z,"And to be even more specific, this is the full install of WinXP x64 integrated SP2-RC, not just the service pack. And no, i did not slipstream this SP myself into the install. The iso image is original."
,andbir,2006-11-27T09:23Z,"Before you install Windows XP Professional x64 Edition, make sure your computer meets the following minimum hardware requirements:

Supported processors: AMD Athlon 64, AMD Opteron, Intel Xeon with Intel Extended Memory 64 Technology (EM64T) support, Intel Pentium 4 with Intel EM64T support 
256 megabytes (MB) RAM 
1.5 gigabytes (GB) of available hard disk space "
,hooZi,2006-11-27T09:43Z,"""ProductKey: you figure it out by yourself"" is this what i think it is, joke? or do we have to look for the key from somewhere? sorry im stupid :)"
,Snooters,2006-11-28T07:35Z,for the # just do a google search. how hard can it be.
,Snooters,2006-11-28T07:54Z,ps this is an evaluation and it needs to be activated as well. kinda worthless.
,andbir,2006-11-28T17:48Z,Well it is a release candidate so of course it is time-limited unless you upgrade it.  As for product key and activation it is just the same as any other normal non-hacked original ISO of WinXP you either have to have a real license number or get a fix somewhere. How hard can it be?
,Todde@Swe,2006-12-02T14:02Z,Why does this WinXP X64 not come in Swedish... is it possible to download the trail version from microsoft and reg it with a working key? :)
,Iddiz,2006-12-15T16:43Z,"Does this one wroks with an AMD Turion x64 (not X2), ML-3400? Also, can you install 32-bit programs?"
