Downloaded ok, opened ok but when I select the app file and it starts doing it's business (I enter the system password and grant it permissions) i get an Error message. That's it. Has anyone got any idea what's going on? I would appreciate your help. Thanks."
,puggy,2006-12-08T04:06Z,That's because it's a trojan and you entered your password. Check your startup processes and look for it.
,grzgrz,2006-12-17T08:07Z,"This is not a trojan. 
It did in fact remove the DVD check from my freshly updated Rev E patch."
,rmccray,2007-03-02T04:19Z,How do I make this work?
,Metalslave,2007-03-02T20:55Z,Can I get a seed or something? It's a super small file...shouldn't be too much trouble...
,guizmo12,2007-03-22T19:25Z,Can you make a direct download plz
,bugallin,2007-04-30T17:42Z,"I dont Know what to do with this file. I have installed the sims2 and the patch, but where does this file go? because I cant installed :S"
,misterfox,2007-06-06T13:27Z,"OMG PEOPLE SEED ITS NOT MOVING! AT ALL

,snavsi,2007-06-15T13:53Z,SEED!!
,toowng,2007-12-04T05:40Z,If the game crashes while loading then you need a better graphics card. The stock Intell 950 won't cut it.
,Dwight18,2007-12-07T05:20Z,"I've been looking for a Rev. F crack, does anyone know where I might find it? Thanks!"
,iheartspain,2007-12-07T23:49Z,"I am getting this error message.  You can't apply the Patch on this File !

What do I do?"
,Confexener,2007-12-19T14:03Z,"im getting the same error but i think its becose of having the new mac operating sistem (LEOPARD)
but if it isnt plz tell me how to open crack becose i can instal the game but i cant apply the crack"
,chopstiks.tpb,2007-12-22T02:01Z,Will this crack work with the Rev. F patch installed? Thanks.
,Jenifergrl,2008-02-23T19:48Z,I don't remember if I got my Sims 2 app from here or not but I'm running an intel mac and it's crashing at certain points during the game.  I checked the file information and it appears that this file is meant for a power pc... not intel.  Probably why it's having issues.  I'll have to load it on my G5 to see if the problem resolves.
,ChristoA1,2008-04-19T22:03Z,"To everyone having problems running the patch, getting errors including reference to ""libcrypto"", check out the page:
http://smartic.us/2007/10/27/leopard-and-non-native-crypto-libraries
It solves the issue with any program using ""the wrong architecture"" or libcrypto or libssl.

Note: I still cannot successfully patch Sims 2 yet, but at least I can run the iPatcher! MacBook with 10.5.2."
,Jenifergrl,2008-04-19T22:15Z,"Does anyone know how to go from rev f to rev e?  I tried downloading a patch for rev e that was 28.6 mb.  It installs on the HD volume and doesn't downgrade my rev f file to rev e.  I had success with downgrading to rev c but I think that goes too far for intel support. (Doesn't work.)

Any help appreciated!"
