,noplay,2006-12-08T09:13Z,I don't think there was a point in history where Islam wasn't at war.
,rlzoom,2007-01-12T17:48Z,Overly simplistic and narrow minded. Worth a watch if you're interested in studying propaganda. It is interesting how propaganada from one side heavily quotes propaganada from the other side. They feed and need each other. The majority of us are on neither of these hateful sides.
,Hamurabi,2007-05-20T21:25Z,"I'm sure it's simplistic and everything (I haven't seen it) but dar-el-har MEANS the non muslim world AND the home of war, signifying that as long as there are non muslims it's a duty to wage war against them. A great many muslims don't feel this way but I'm sure a great many germans in the 30's didn't feel like invading Poland.

I'm not saying that in general the muslim side is always to blame but this cannot be ignored with the explanation that only a minority subscribes to these views (although I do believe that that is true)."

This is the kind of American-propaganda-shit the facist americans use to scare itÂ´s own people, and no wonder they are so mad at Americans when they steal their oil and bring war to those poor people. Let them be!!!"

To be honest, I've been tired of being politically incorrect for way too long.

,nutella59,2011-05-06T19:30Z,"How funny...  JUST AS leftists in the '30s did not want to make war to German NAZISM in the name of peace BEFORE IT WAS TOO LATE and Hitler armed Germany to its teeth, which cost 80 million dead; now the same leftists and phony ""pacifists"" call fascists those who want to STOP FASCISM, now islamo-fascism, islamo-nazism...
Some people never learn from history... Or, MAY BE THEY HATE JEWS SO MUCH and think it's all because of them and it only the Jews who are going to pay...
But, as it goes for the People of Israel, so it goes for the world!  "
