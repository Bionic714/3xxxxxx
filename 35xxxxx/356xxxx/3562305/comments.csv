,everlander2007,2007-01-03T20:07Z,Great fun facts about World Trade Center and 9/11: http://www.grandtheftcountry.com/facts/911/towers/
,everlander2007,2007-01-07T00:42Z,"This ""movie"" is pure PROPAGANDA and DISINFORMATION!!

For a real documentary about what really happend on 9/11, you should watch ""911 Mysteries"", ""In Plane Site"" and ""Loose Change 2nd Edition"".

WAKE UP!!"
