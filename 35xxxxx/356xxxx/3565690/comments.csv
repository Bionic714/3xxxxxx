,Waldobaby,2006-11-27T21:45Z,"(a good picturewiever is recommended as all files are .jpg and not a crappy .pdf - file)
or archive the whole shebang, change the extension to CBR or CBZ as appropriate, and use comic book reader."
,tooTiredtoo,2006-11-28T00:55Z,"Thanks for the feedback both :)

Diane 1 and 2 will be available in a day or two, dont have time today."
,lound,2006-11-28T21:00Z,"Would also be nice if you could seed Hilda 1 and 2 if you got them.
:)"
,tooTiredtoo,2006-11-29T01:00Z,"Ofcourse Loud, but first Diane. 
My version of Hilda 1 is not equal quality on all jpgs, some are smaller. If anyone else has the first volume with all hq jpgs - maybe they can up it instead of me?"

Thanks for that, I too tried to get them, nogo."
