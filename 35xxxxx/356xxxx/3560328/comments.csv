,JoakimLj,2006-12-01T19:18Z,"there are no covers for this one, I know I've talked with the director/creator."
,FlareStorm,2006-12-04T11:50Z,"Really is an amazing work that has been developing over the last year

The guy put together a functional DVD from KOTOR dialogue, gameplay, and cut-scenes.

Some of it is uploaded to YouTube at: http://www.youtube.com/profile?user=kevinsocal2k 

but the quality isn't gonna be nearly as good.

and the author has a thread at:
http://boards.theforce.net/games_videogames/b10005/18173009/
where you can see how the development has evolved.

I've seen some. I'm personally gonna download this and seed it to hell.  Stuff like this is what filesharing was made for."
[V],nimbus123,2006-12-09T16:48Z,"This is awesome. If I had the space, I would still be seeding. I've copied up the movie on dvd for some of my friends who've played he game.
The story seems to be developing good too. I won't give in to my anger.. well maybe I will... no wait, I'm a Jedi.. wtf?
hehe, hope for evil ending."
,07paul,2007-01-05T23:06Z,"how do i work this, i have downloaded this & taken it into utorrent but it said i need to connect to a seeder, how do i connect."
,afBeaver,2007-01-18T12:57Z,"this looks great! i allways thought the kotor story should be made into a movie.

is it made out if clips from the game or is it live action?"
,JoakimLj,2007-01-21T17:14Z,"afbeaver, it's clips from the game..."
,Enishi_Xagan,2007-02-16T00:15Z,Damn! This thing takes forever to download!
,JoakimLj,2007-03-07T15:43Z,"for a smaller file (only the movie, 1GB) download here:

,ConnorMarc,2008-06-29T21:18Z,"Pretty interesting and pretty good story as well. This is based on the game I suspect. I haven't been into PC games since the mid 90s. Anyway, where's Episode 2? I HAVE to see how this end. Great stuff guys."
