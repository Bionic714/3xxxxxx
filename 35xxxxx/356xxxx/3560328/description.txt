This is an excellent fan film created by Kaydon_Sentry. Kaydon has impressively crafted the a movie from the game Star Wars Knights of the Old Rpeublic. This is the first episode of a planned trilogy.

Enjoy!


\\\\\\\"Knights of the Old Republic: Episode I\\\\\\\" is NOT the game - it is a non-profit film - more a labor of love. \\\\\\\"Star Wars\\\\\\\" is a registered trademark of Lucasfilm LTD., and the KOTOR game and universe is a product of both LucasArts & Bioware. Thank you George Lucas for letting filmmakers go explore in this world. 

This work is to promote and share the lore of the Knights of the Old Republic game series, to those who otherwise wouldn\\\\\\\'t be able to, due to being either \\\\\\\'non-gamers\\\\\\\', or fans who simply don\\\\\\\'t have the 40+ hours it is required to experience it all. 

KOTOR Episode I was not made for money. It was made to introduce to a new audience, as well as its faithful, a fresh and cinematic take on this fascinating era.

Knights of the Old Republic


Four thousand years before
the rise of the Galactic
Empire, the Republic verges
on collapse. DARTH MALAK,
last surviving apprentice of
the Dark Lord Revan, has
unleashed an invincible
Sith armada upon an
unsuspecting galaxy.

Crushing all resistance
Malak\\\\\\\'s war of conquest
has left the Jedi Order
scattered and vulnerable
as countless Knights fall in
battle, and many more
swear allegiance to the new
Sith Master.

In the skies above the Outer
Rim world of Taris, a Jedi
battle fleet engages the
forces of Darth Malak in a
desperate effort to halt the
Sith\\\\\\\'s galactic domination....
