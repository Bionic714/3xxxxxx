,Peaknik,2006-12-01T18:21Z,Are you saying THIS software has virus?
,UptownDave,2006-12-01T18:51Z,"It isn't a virus, but a false positive reading.  The ""virus"" he's referring to is the Process.exe file.  When scanning files such as this one, which is a ""command line process utility"" used to shut down processes (in this case, the Virus Burst processes), some virus programs will label it as a PUP (Potentially Unwanted File).  

In other words, virus utilities cannot always tell if the "" motives"" of some files are malicious or good. This is why we dont automatically delete every single file the virus programs label as  *possibly* a bad file.  

After ridding the system of Virus Burst, you can safely delete the SmitFraudFix files from your computer."
