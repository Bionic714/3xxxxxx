,allmypeople,2006-12-07T17:38Z,"This is a fantastic episode.
It is the first flashback episode that made me want to re-watch the last 20 episodes.

The tension and emotions that are let loose in the episode are stunning and the acting is incredible. I'm not going to give anything away but there's a scene when Adama informs someone some startling information... and the acting is just amazing... The character gets floored and we feel it too.

This episode shows why this series is so effective and so universally praised."
