,mhmatt,2006-12-02T02:07Z,"Hey dude, if you have Azereus just open the torrent and when you get to the screen of where to save and stuff, then uncheck all the songs you don't want and click ok, and Azereus will only download the ones you want (though you will have all the files listed, the ones you didnt want will be 0 bytes, so delete those ones after)"

,Oxyntas-Kovacs,2010-06-09T02:29Z,"I Love ""Tool"" & U Should 2 ,This is the Best Tool discography TORRENT Right Now ,Recommended.
Really ""mhmatt"" You are A Great MAN .
Thank you 4 sharing with us this Pure Rock ."
,DrAnal,2010-06-15T05:32Z,"@Oxyntas - by definition, a collection labeled discography should include every studio/official release to the date of the collection.  There can be no ""best"", only whether it ""is"" or ""is not"" a discography.  Everything and anything else is a compilation, subject to the subjectivity of the listener who can classify it as ok, good, best, etc. Compilation of course being a collection of recordings by a single artist (or individual among several acts, a la John Fogerty, Slash, Ozzy, and of course MJK himself).  Technically, since Tool releases singles for radio promotion, this is NOT the discography as of 11/2006 as it is missing the Lateralus, Aenima and Undertow singles along with Vicarious (The Pot and Jambi had not yet been released, officially)"
,mavric212,2010-06-21T12:45Z,"anyway, thanks for the good job."

,The_Skant,2011-02-05T04:58Z,"Great torrent, obviously great music. Thanks to all for seeding.

Also if you guys like this music you should definitely consider buying some of Tool's CDs, if not for anything other than as a sign of appreciation for the artists that produce the music we all enjoy."
