,artemis+,2006-11-22T22:56Z,"i so want this, but i wish it wasn't compressed so much. movie-only would have been preferable. thanks"
,el_segundo,2006-11-22T23:59Z,Iso quality is pretty good. I did do a couple of test burns before I posted the finalised iso and the version I uploaded came out the best. Can't please everyone. Maybe I'll do the full uncompressed DVD later when I've got the bandwidth.
,UnchosenOne,2006-11-23T09:51Z,"thanks!
As I'm studying French now, I'd really love to see this in full (I saw some parts of it, and really loved it)
I only wish there were French subs as well (for my studying purposes), but this will do, really :)"
,jomos352,2007-06-13T12:48Z, i m a fan of Mark Dacascos and i have been looking for the dvd version fo this movie for a long time. thanks man!!!
,rrpostal,2008-08-14T16:51Z,"Awesome, I real version. generally don't bother with full rips, but this one's worth it for the non-subbed version. Thanks."

,thijs12b,2008-10-26T13:12Z,Does it needs like to be decompressed or can i just open it with Divx?
,thijs12b,2008-10-26T20:58Z,Can someone please tell me how i can run this file on my PC or do i need to burn it?
