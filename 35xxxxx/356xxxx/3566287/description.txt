Fifteen years in the future, by high-level scientific
power, a violent battle takes place between the
dimension La'cryma, that protects humanity, and
the dimension Shangri-La, that plans the annihilation
of all space-time. The key to stopping Shangri-La's
invasion is a mysterious object known as "The Dragon's
Torque." A group known as the Dragon Calvary is being
set through space and time to find it.

In the present, twelve-year-old Haruka and
her friend Yuu are contemplating running away
from home when they meet a member of the Dragon
Calvary named Karasu (Crow). He believes that
Haruka has the Dragon's Torque and claims to be
Yuu from fifteen years in the future.
