The above poster (bpd1069) is a disinfo agent. As you can see from his post, he's trying to distract you from looking at the evidence. Don't fall for this clown. Look at the evidence for yourself and decide for yourself. Judy Wood's and Morgan Reynolds' work is based on scientific laws, aka the Laws of Physics.

Don't fall for clowns that try to distract you from looking at evidence. It's obvious that those clowns are disinfo agents and trying desperately to keep their classified technology a secret. Look at the evidence for yourself. Anyone who discourages others from looking at information is a disinfo agent."
