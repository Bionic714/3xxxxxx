,moreblahniks,2006-12-01T01:01Z,"hey guys, i have a question.  budapest 2004 had some vfr city landmarks and danube bridges; 2007 doesnt seem to have them beyond the generic autogen.  ferihegy looks better in '07 but i was hoping for some better modelled vfr stuff?  is something missing from this rip or is this the way tha add-on is intended?  personally, the airport is priority no 1, but damn, some well done 3d landmarks are a close 2nd!  anymore info??  thanks....."
,moreblahniks,2006-12-01T01:04Z,"one last thing, maybe purists disagree, but i think the lago rome and venice vfr packs are the best!"

,zkalos,2006-12-06T21:16Z,"For Old Budapest Airports:
No need for an actual patch. 
Just copy your 

AF2_LHBS.bgl 
AF2_LHDK.bgl 
AF2_LHFH.bgl 
AF2_LHGD.bgl 
AF2_LHHH.bgl 
AF2_LHTL.bgl 
bp200x_excl.bgl 
bplib200x-1.bgl 
bplib200x-2.bgl 
bplib200x-3.bgl 
budapest200x.bgl 
budfalib.bgl 
into the lower directory's scenery folder - where the city files are - not the airport, and you got a fully working version. 

You also need to copy ALL bitmap files to the texture folder of the same directory from the old Budapest, all of those NOT starting with 
011232*.bmp 
Hope it helps. "
,zkalos,2006-12-06T22:02Z,I upload the files to this site for You!
,moreblahniks,2006-12-07T18:29Z,"thanks for the input...but i have the 2004 lago version, i believe, and the files don't match exactly; i saw the same aerosoft forum and tried the swap but it didn't work.  i'd still like confirmation that this TPB 2007 RIP has ALL the files and that the budapest landmarks were in fact left out by aerosoft (we know the nearby airports were).  basically i want the 2004 landmarks like parliament, budavar, gellert hegy and the bridges!  actually it's kind of annoying that the eye candy was not improved, let alone completely left out!  what's with turquoise buda castle?? LOL.  anyway, any info would be much appreciated and thanks again for the fs2004 torrents!"
