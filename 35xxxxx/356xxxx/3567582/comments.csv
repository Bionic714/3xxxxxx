,henryh,2006-12-01T00:37Z,Why not one PDF-file instead of many Jpgs?

1-2 and 3 of hilda is now posted.

Henryh, I absolutely hate pdf files. Maybe I am doing it wrong - but all pdfs I have downloaded is small and very bad quality if you try to enlarge them. The jpgs of these Kovacq comics are high-quality (mostly) - so I share them in their original state. A good jpg-viewer (like ACDSee) is in my opinion far better to use than Acrobat.

Anyway, Thanks for helping me to seed :)"
