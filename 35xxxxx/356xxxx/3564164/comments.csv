,p.heinzl,2007-02-19T14:45Z,what´s the password for the language files?
,brainz,2007-03-21T12:34Z,"bhaskarsj: For tutorials and stuff you could check http://www.c4dcafe.com and http://www.c4dportal.com/forum/forumdisplay.php?f=4. Both require you to register yourself on the forums, but are totally free of charge ;)

p.heinzl: Password? What password? If there's some password put on the language files, just download them from Maxons site. They should be there.

And for the MoGraph plugin... it comes with the bundle - but won't be installed with the normal settings. I finaly got it installed by running the INSTALL_MODULES.EXE"
