,Lucifer tfa,2006-11-27T20:10Z,"NOT THE FIRST!!!! 
DEUS WAS THE FIRST IN THE SERIES!!!!!!

,iox42,2006-11-30T11:34Z,"Keep Seeding dudes, i have longed for this game."
,wallball5,2006-12-17T01:07Z,"Wait, how do I install? Do I just unzip it or do I have to download the torrent that came with it?"
,karmapaw,2007-02-14T05:08Z,"Sorry, but no, Deus was not the first game (even though technically it might have been made before Deus Ex). Deus just happens to have a similar name, but has NOTHING to do with the Deus Ex series.

So yes, this game (Deus Ex) is the first game in the Deus Ex series. Lovely game. A bit hard though..."
