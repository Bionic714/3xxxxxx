,Furio65,2007-05-29T23:24Z,"With all these remarks why does anyone bother to download??? Since when does ""Europe"" fit on one cd?"
,RealV1king,2007-06-10T10:16Z,"I downloaded it. Works great. It;s not completely Europe, but Central Europe! (Austria, Switzerland, Czech Republik, Southern Germany, North Italy and MAJOR ROADS EUROPE)

,tux-lord,2007-08-12T02:28Z,"Which Versions does this work on, I downloaded one before, but it only worked on MS5000 models, mine is a PN2050 and it doesn't swallow CD's.. only SD cards!!! 

This torrent has the same information file, so i'm guessing this one as well only works on MS5000 models? or atleast only models that swallow cd's?"
,nilsfairchild,2008-03-24T12:51Z,"This regards only Switzerland Austria etc. 
My computer told me that a virus was in it!!!!
I immediately deleted the files"
,mr-atari,2008-08-14T14:11Z,"Deleted the cdclone.zip (has a virus!) and burned with nero using the .cue image.
Fits perfectly on 1 CD.
Tested on my Dayton VDO MS 4200 and works.
Thanks for the upload!"
