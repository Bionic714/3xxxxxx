,dan-333,2006-11-29T21:00Z,I uploaded this version for everyone who want to use their mp3 players.. otherwise FLAC is lossless compressed and therefore better.
,knaak,2006-11-29T22:11Z,that was hellastupid.
,ruben123,2006-11-29T22:16Z,"lol, if it only was that easy...
I wouldnt have to leave my home.... ever...."
,dan-333,2006-11-29T23:06Z,"@ knaak

According to: http://www.bwgen.com/faq.htm#MP3COMPRESSION
it is encoded correctly, ""You can check the results of MP3 compression very easily: if you hear a continuous tone when listening to left and right channel separately, and a pulsating sound (binaural beat) when listening to them with headphones, the output is correct.""..."
,knaak,2006-11-29T23:36Z,The quality of the encode wasnt in question.. how some annoying sounds is gonna make me feel anything else then naucious is. Thanks but I'll stick to weed :P.
,ruben123,2006-11-30T00:53Z,"Well... downloaded it but couldnt get myself to listen more than 5 minutes because im an impatient fuck.. but now im curious.
Do u use this urself dan-333?
If so, do u feel this thing working?
How long do u listen, guess u dont listen the full hour..?"
,dan-333,2006-11-30T13:24Z,"@ knaak
google for ""binaural beat"" and findout the specs behind this cd

@ruben123
acctually I just started to listen to this kind of stuff a month ago or so, and I felt it's affects my first time..
how I do it, is: 
I lay down , relax.
use my mp3 player with Good/comfy headphones
and then after 3 - 4 minutes I feel that my body gets heavy and/or starting to spin, later I disconnect my body entirely and come into a completly diffrent athmosfear ( totoly counsius of the real world)

If you get annoyed by the bineural sound itself, there are other beats with more musical contents: search for ex: hives or ethos...

I havent had the most powerfull effects with this cd, but it's fun to exeriment with diffrent frekvensies ( If you take your time, you will noties that the cd shifts over the whole range during this cd, the ones listed in the desc. that is!)"
,ruben123,2006-12-05T00:11Z,"ok, tnx for ur help and for uploading something fresh and different..
Will be fun testing this"
,shakewell,2006-12-12T12:53Z,It made me grow tits -- just like weed does!

,Devoney2,2007-06-19T21:12Z,"Gonna check this out right now. Just listened to a preset called ""Concious Theta Experience"". Also uses 4Hz binarual Beats, I was gone for a good 15 minutes. not asleep, I sat upright, but did not think about daily matters and my very important school exam tomorrow. What ever you do when listening to binaural beats, just dont stress your mind. Dont think you need to be thinking of absolutely nothing. Just undergo the sound, and turn the volume down if it annoyes you.

if you enjoyed this, www.bwgen.com might be an interesting site for you to check out."
,Renaissance,2007-09-11T08:33Z,OMG this really works!!! I`ve never had a similar experience! WOW! 
,robot6,2007-10-27T20:09Z,Seed plz!!!!
,dr_rex_ford,2007-12-27T05:57Z,"after researching the subject, im convinced. but whenever I listen, I get kinda scared... I mean, these sounds are frickin' CRAZY. Some frickin alien stuff... I feel like any message can be injected into me- what if I go crazy and murder someone?

just a thought."
,Foustace,2008-01-17T21:08Z,"dr rex ford should lay off the ganja,
thats what im using this for :/
hopfully i can substitute buddah for this till my exams are over :/"
,charlieUK,2008-03-04T23:01Z,"i was apprehensive
but i would 100% recommend it!
not quite as good as weed, but..."
,JerryZarga,2008-03-13T20:12Z,"I try this sound in a very critical moment of stress and anxiety and really works very good, if you're interested in experiment more, try I-Doser."
,hagenisse,2008-05-21T22:40Z,"I just feel a bit sick, and time seems like a more irrelevant dimension. But hell, I guess it's because I am not really relaxing and letting it in..? Like, using msn, but doesn't it interrupt those things? Why not just break into my head and take me away..?"
,killerkid0101,2008-07-08T07:39Z,"seed please.. tryna get into some meditation , cant do no drugs , dont wanna either "

,Gazzu,2008-09-03T23:16Z,anyone tried out to smoke some ganja and listening this ? :P
,CrAcKeZ,2008-09-05T23:12Z,"Quality is good, everything seems to be as they should be but I really didn't feel anything and sure I was relaxed I also had my eyes closed and the headphones in a confortable volume.. after ~15 minutes I just want to sleep hahahaha. I'm currently listen to the sound but still nothing and I'm on ~18minutes. Anyway thank's dan for the upload.

P.S. This sound because it's a steady will not bother me even if I try to sleep(and I'm a light sleeper)"
,CrAcKeZ,2008-09-10T02:49Z,"I check even further about bilaural pulses so I find out that this mp3 is not working properly.

""if you hear a continuous tone when listening to left and right channel separately"" 

which is not a continuous! 

""and a pulsating sound (binaural beat) when listening to them with headphones, the output is correct. ""

Sorry dan-333 but the mp3 is useless ;) thank's for trying though"
,EvilBadHamster,2009-03-18T10:09Z,"Its pretty weird... ;s tryed it, and in the start it feels like you have got laughing gas, at the dentist. that's so far I have got the first 15 min.. But then i can't take more.... feels like the dentist are drilling in my theats... BUT THIS DIGITAL DRUGS, ARE DOING SOMETHING... a try worth!"
