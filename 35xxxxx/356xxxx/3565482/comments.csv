,sandrew77,2006-11-26T22:35Z,subs? extras?
,ksoktogon,2006-11-27T00:47Z,"It seems as if there was no compression, but please could you be a bit more specific?"
,tobiaspetrini,2006-11-27T06:31Z,"all subs, all extras (as far as I remember) this is a pure DVD copy

this is my first try to share... looking good so far, but I realise that i) its going to be a long time before someone else gets the entire movie and ii) it would have been convenient for you if I had shared the compressed version..."
,mizar,2006-12-07T00:38Z,Great upload! Congratulations and thank you very much. I compressed and burned the movie with AVS Video Converter.

,putterick,2007-04-02T21:26Z,Why is there no sound? i have tried to play it with both windows media player and jet audio but no sound
,linneh,2008-05-06T22:22Z,"Uhm... Compresse? How do i do that ? It came in a folder called VIDEO_TS and with 17 files, most .vob files... How do I get the files together in one unit? The way it is now I can't pick subtitles either... Whould have been nice with a fast aswer ;)"
,twisted_finger,2008-06-16T22:41Z,"linneh, you can use special software that'll assemble entire DVD for you? e.g. Nero 8.

PS seed plz, i'm lookin' forward to watch the movie ;)"
,koucz12345,2008-07-10T02:44Z,"FULL DVD9 VERSION- FULL QUALITY

,kechiguy,2008-11-14T06:45Z,"Thank you, GMT! Great quality and sound!"
,Toribor,2009-07-02T00:40Z,"If you don't have a dual layer burner or don't have dual layer disks you will need to download DVDShrink (Freeware) and open the Video_TS tolder, if you have Nero you can burn directly from DVDShrink but I suggest saving it to a .ISO and then using IMGBurn to burn the disk."
