(as for the procedure, i also never got the point of zipping games in 500 pieces...:/)"

,J.Tramiel,2007-01-29T21:15Z,"tmx1123 - There isn't a frigging installation file because this is a PS2 GAME YOU KNOB!

I wouldn't bother downloadin this though seriously... its a REALLY shit game!  Jerky graphics - dodgy physics and very annoying music.  Simply awful!"
,jackfresh14,2007-02-13T15:20Z,could somebody please tell me how i burn this or any game so it works. all i seem to get on my ps2 is unable to read data on disc. or something along those lines.
,J.Tramiel,2007-02-22T22:58Z,"Your PS2 must be chipped / or swap method enabled.

Or - you have PS2 Network Adapter with HDD and Boot Software

Also, must burn to high grade DVD-R
(not DVD+R)

Hope this helps!"

,dhruv990,2009-02-02T09:38Z,"@ nowaydude: youre the noob dude, you dont even know what a multi-volume archive is???!!!
And for those who dont get the point of them, there are two things for eg, for me its usefull cuz my dvd-writer on my laptop is busted so if i need to write the iso i need to put it on my desktop, but i only have a 2gb pendrive so i just make into multiple volumes of 2gb and transfer it on my desktop.
for torrents its useful cuz, if a file gets corrupted in the downloading process u can just download that particular rar file again instead of downloading the entire 3 gb iso.
BTW this torrent has an iso no rars"
