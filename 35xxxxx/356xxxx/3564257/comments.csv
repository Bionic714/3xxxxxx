,El Jafar,2006-11-25T14:27Z,"If you use bitcomet, you can set it up so it goes through the donwload when finished and checks the CRC on all blocks.
Personal, I'm not fond of the rar-format unless it gives a compression gain."
,longlivetheking,2006-11-25T14:31Z,Does it work on WinXP?
[T],WinstonSmith6079,2006-11-25T23:55Z,"Yes, it does work on WinXP."
,koshman,2006-11-26T17:56Z,add the RAR issue - with ISOs it always reduces the size
[T],WinstonSmith6079,2006-11-30T05:52Z,"Kewl, koshman.  I'll actually try that .ISO thing sometime (though I am fond of .BINs & .CUEs)."
,nickbilljim,2006-12-06T10:12Z,"i am new to this.When I try to run this game I am asked which programe to open it with,any help would be appreciated thanks"
[T],WinstonSmith6079,2006-12-06T11:01Z,"Try using Nero or (better yet) Alcohol 120% to open the .CUE file with.  Or alternately simply drag & drop either the .BIN or the .CUE onto Alcohol 120%'s window to burn to a blank CD.

If you do not wish to burn it to CD, but would prefer to run the CD-image (a virtual CD) from your HD: Alcohol 120% creates a virtual DVD and CD drive.  Such as in My Computer, right-click on the virtual drive and select Mount Image.  Then browse for, in this case, 'SFC.cue'.

You can d/l one of several copies of Alcohol 120% from this very site at any given time as it's a very good and popular prg for handling CD-images."
,nickbilljim,2006-12-06T12:05Z,"Where do I find default shortcut,"
[T],WinstonSmith6079,2006-12-07T15:45Z,"""Default shortcut""?  ???  You don't get one of those until you follow the above instructions to install the game.  Then, after you install the game, it can be found in your Start Menu."
,sakyak,2006-12-08T23:30Z,"I D/Led this and i installed it onto my computer.. and when i run the game it works.  However, the buttons for Campaign and Skirmish are dulled out and cannot be selected.  Any fix for this?"
,sakyak,2006-12-09T00:01Z,"Nevermind, i figured it out.  Thanks for putting this file up!"
,picklesnpopcorn,2006-12-31T19:28Z,"I can't get any keyboard commands to work. All I get when a push a key is that ding sound that tells me I'm an idiot. The only key that works with this game is esc, and closes the game. I can play with the mouse only, but it is a little annoying. Also, I can't save. Not sure if it is because I can't enter text or some other reason. Anyone else have these problems?"
[T],WinstonSmith6079,2007-01-01T21:57Z,"Dunno, man, as you should be able to use the keyboard along with the mouse.  Never heard of that error, but when strange and unusual errors occur try reinstalling the game--maybe that will fix it...."
,picklesnpopcorn,2007-01-08T19:34Z,"Ok I figured it out. Not sure why, but this problem was occurring when I tried to run the game from the disk image. When I run the game from the .exe file, it worked perfectly."
,Anurlaiqar,2007-05-26T16:41Z,I'm having the same problem as Sakyak - the buttons for Campaign and Skirmish are dulled out. How can I fix this?
,stefansnijder,2007-06-16T10:32Z,"i've problem's too with the campaign and the skirmish button's. there dulled out.
how to fix that?"
,stefansnijder,2007-06-16T10:40Z,"sakyak, how did you do that?"
,skullNbones,2008-02-12T03:46Z,"Set compatibility mode to Windows 2000. 
Thanks for the upload."
,Blue_shift,2008-08-01T01:21Z,"Thanks for the Upload! Im a StarTrek nut so.. this is like Gold. (no pun intended =P)

For those who do not want to use Alcho 120%, there is another program that is deticated to just creating ""Virtual Disk Drives"". That program is Daemon Tools (Lite). It can create upto 5 ""virtual"" disks at one time, and saves you the trouble of downloading Alcho (which includes burn-to-disk files that take a little space up), and in general saves you a disk."
,plasmafox2038,2008-12-03T06:01Z,"DAEMON TOOLS BAD

VIRTUAL CLONEDRIVE GOOD"
,Sector123,2009-12-23T16:30Z,"I have installed this program, but the Campaign and Skirmish buttons are grayed out as well.  I have configured the system to Window 2000 and have installed Microsoft's latest DirectX.  Help!"
,whazzup3929,2010-05-07T20:32Z,this is a download i have been using for several years and i thought i would comment on it again...it works..100%....u will need to fiddle with the compatibility options and probably x out the desktop option..but it does work...daemon tools ftw baby...TYVM UPLDER!!!
,whazzup3929,2010-05-08T01:49Z,not liking the new format of 2 though..but a lot of races to choose from...just not much story there..3...is so dumbed down..that its painful...
,Talyn_Dude,2010-08-22T16:22Z,"Downloaded this overnight, loads and installs fine on Daemon Tools, runs perfectly on XP if you set compatibility to W2K.

Many thanks to the U/L!!!!"
,barutazaru,2011-01-16T02:44Z,"hey guys, i downloaded this, but the problem is that i tried switching the compatablity mode to windows 2000 and installed the latest directX but the campaign and skirmish are still dulled out, any ideas on what to do about it?"
,Cain1991,2011-10-18T17:15Z,"I have a question. I downloaded the file using Vuse, then I mount the CUE file with Daemon Tools.

Then it does nothing. Absolutely nothing.

How the heck do I fix this?

Any help is greatly appreciated. Please and thanks."
