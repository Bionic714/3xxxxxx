,sandreas,2006-11-20T16:54Z,"Thx for uploading .rar files. I've downloaded the Torrent with WinUHA files. Not very userfriendly.
Thumbs up Bernhard and RELOADED"
,sandreas,2006-11-20T21:07Z,"Common guys, please seed. I know its a big torrent, but waiting 25 hours for this cool game sux. :("
,kjelldennis,2006-11-21T15:12Z,seed please
,sanxo,2006-11-21T16:16Z,"Hi, i have downloaded the torrent now, installing atm but i wonder, where is this crack you speak of? is it located within one of the many rar files with the ""winrar"" logo on it? or is it the one on the top? (rld-me2a.rar) thanks :D very nice dl bernhard"
[V],Bernhard,2006-11-21T17:00Z,the crack is located in DVD 1
,ftagaidin,2006-11-21T23:46Z,"best strategy game ever made (well, there's starcraft:P)"
,Zade911,2006-11-21T23:58Z,"Now i've been dling from both this and the other torrent, PLEASE SEED!"
,silence02,2006-11-22T04:32Z,"I need some help, I've downloaded and installed the game; however, I have no idea how to start it up. I mount the iso for dvd 1 and the screen comes up. I click play and it tells me to insert the cd-rom. Wat should I do?"
,silence02,2006-11-22T04:35Z,"Also when I click on the crack, a small window appears with the yellow triangle with an exclamation mark through it and all I can press is ok. It also says CA_LIBS on the top. Is this how the crack is supppst to work?"
,Zade911,2006-11-22T15:08Z,"Thanks for the seeds, i'm done.

AND I WILL KEEP SEEDING!!! :)"
,BiReal,2006-11-22T15:29Z,Yeah thanks this game is awesome. 
,BiReal,2006-11-22T15:51Z,"silence02:  it works perfect for me, have you copy the crack file into your installation directory.?  and replaced it with the .exe file? 
As written above: Copy the cracked files located in the Crack directory on DVD1 to your
installation directory.

I think either your trying to start the game from the ISO file threw deamon tool, or your trying to start the crack(from your iso) without copying it into the directory where your installation is located. "
,Dibrani,2006-11-22T19:38Z,"tjena grabbar. Kan inte få spelet att funka riktigt. när jag ska börja spela så , just när jag ska spela bana hastings så blir det flimmer i skärmen och sen blir monitorn svart.
är du drivrutinerna till grafikkortet eller.
Tror ni att det hjälper att uppgradera drivisarna.?"
,silence02,2006-11-22T22:28Z,"BiReal: I am  trying to start the game from the ISO file through deamon tools.... how else do you do it, and how do I replace the crack with the .exe file? All I did was put the crack folder into the Medieval 2 Total War."
,sandreas,2006-11-23T04:26Z,"Exactly Silence02.

Cracked games usually got a cracked .exe in a Crack directory(thx RELOADED) which you need to over""write"" the original .exe in the main directory before you can get game running.
I'm so happy about this torrent that I'll keep seeding for quite a while.
And I usually do not do that. I know, I've been an asshole."
,silence02,2006-11-23T06:04Z,Can I delete the DvD 1 and DvD 2 stuff once I've installed the game. Or do I need the files?
,sandreas,2006-11-23T12:49Z,"No, you must seed.
But I think you only need DVD1 to play the game."
,Henkus128,2006-11-23T14:03Z,Dibrani... jag har samma prob. men saken är den att jag tror att grafikkortet inte pallar spelet..anting uppdatera drivisarna eller sno ett nytt på ett lan..bara välja:P
,dekyi,2006-11-23T16:20Z,DAMN... nice game.....
,The_swedish_piratemaster,2006-11-23T16:51Z,fan sluta inte sända de har varit 13 seders nu 7 tankar i 30 kbit
,The_swedish_piratemaster,2006-11-23T16:54Z,send after u download it .
,Dibrani,2006-11-24T00:34Z,"Fixade det. Jag bara uppgraderade drivrutinerna till mitt grafikkort och sedan så funkade det bra.
Så ta och testa det Henkus128. :D"
,theviewers,2006-11-24T04:11Z,"will the crack enable the multiplayer invalid cd key message to go and get us online ? 


The game itself works fine but online play aint happnin."

,SillyHudson,2006-12-06T16:59Z,this is probably the most stupid question ever asked but to my defense I'm only 12. When you get the message that you need to insert disc2 how am i suposed to do that?
,Adoddode,2006-12-06T18:03Z,Silly you need to downlode Alcohol 120% or Deamon Tools on Piratebay... then install that and emulate a DVD driver. Then just mount the ISO to it! Easy as that! (just make shure you dont use Kernel debugMod) (then it will never work on your pc!)

,barcafan1990,2007-03-15T22:41Z,I've been downloading this file for at least 2 weeks..how can i make it go faster....ive downloaded age of empires III in like 5 days??
,MaxAlcolo,2007-03-22T18:04Z,"I don't understand how people are having problems installing this game. Especially when it's explained step by step on this page. Anyway, that's how I did it and it worked.

1. Open the first RAR file in the DVD1 directory and extract the ISO file (rld-me2a.iso).

2. Do the same thing with the first RAR file in the DVD2 directory. This time the ISO file should be named ""rld-me2b.iso"".

3. Run Daemon Tools. It can easily be downloaded from the internet, just Google it.

4. Right-click on the Daemon Tools icon located in the lower right corner of your screen, next to the computer clock.
Go to: ""Virtual CD/DVD-ROM -> Set number of devices"" and choose ""2 drives"".

5. Go back to ""Virtual CD/DVD-ROM"", move your mouse of ""Device 0"" and choose ""Mount image"".

6. Select the first ISO file, wich is ""rld-me2a.iso"". After a few seconds the Autorun or InstallShield should pop up. Keep Daemon Tools running, we're not done yet with it.

7. Click on ""Install"". You're going to be asked for a CD-Key. Copy and paste this one: ""S3U6-W8R9-D26N-X34L"".

8. About half way through the installation process, a message will pop up asking you to insert or to locate the second DVD by browsing through your computer. Go back to Daemon Tools and mount the second ISO file (rld-me2b.iso) on ""Device 1"".

9. Go back to the game installation window and select the second DVD virtual drive. Mine was [:E], but yours could be different depending on what you already had on your computer.

10. The installation will complete on it's own. Now, right-click on the first virtual drive of the game and click on ""Open"". Go to the Crack directory and copy and paste the file into the directory you installed the game in.


That's it."

Just wanted to tell you that if you wanted to play the Rise and Fall game can use the latest YASU version to go around the Starforce Protection that so long kept the downloaded version from working.

Just download the SFClone DVD Rise and Fall

Then it's just to play!

And now it wont go away, even if i uninstall the game.
that is the only thing i havent done exactly correct.
does it cause any trouble/how do i get rid of it? help would be very appreciated! I love this game!"
,Bernhard,2007-06-30T17:00Z,"I dont understand it. How come you guys have problem instaling the game.

1. Extract the files so u get the iso files.
2. Mount the iso's with daemon tools, and it will autorun.
3. After the insatllation copy the crack from DVD 1 to your instalation folder.
5. Now play the gmae and have fun"

So if you've mounted the game, go to My Computer and right-click on the virtual drive that contains the DVD1 of the game and click on Open. There's your Crack directory with all the other installation files.

If you burned the image to a DVD, simply slide the first DVD into the drive and do exactly the same thing.

Enjoy the game."

2 Mount the file Disc1 and Disc 2 with Daemon tools light, if u dont know how to mount go to this site http://www.digital-digest.com/articles/mount_watch_iso_files_page1.html
3 type the serial key in, and when they ask for disc 2 click on the file that is in within  Disc2 that you have unrared and then on the file /main.
5 Copy the crack to the map where you have installed medieval to the main map and you wil replace a file with the crack. Or google for more info.

,madsmiles11,2009-07-18T05:43Z,"To UNRAR them. First click one of the CDs, then while in there, there should be multiple files to unrar. Hold Ctrl down and drag over each one, and click the extra ones that you don't get with the drag, make sure your holding down the ctrl at all times. Then when they are all highlighted right click one of them, and choose extract files. After your done a folder will show up in the CD, within that folder is one file to unrar, but you don't need to unrar it, it will be mountable, rinse and repeat, and the crack is in the dvd in the file that u mount, just double click that rar file and it will be right there."
,Knitking,2009-07-25T13:29Z,"Thanks! Looks nice :) have avoided downloading this because of the turn-based system, but a friend told me it's better than civ and that the RTS elements are really cool... Is he right? that I'll like it even though I don't enjoy turn-based? "

2) open up the dvd 1 folder, and extract rld-mea (I made a new folder on the desktop)
3)Open up the dvd 2 folder, and extract rld-mea2 (I made a new folder again on the desktop)
4)Mount the image using daemon and mount the image (Click on the folder you made for dvd 1 and it should be in there), while its installing
5)When it asks for CD 2, open daemon, unmount the previous image, and open up the folder you made for dvd 2, and it should be there
6) after it installs, mount the image from dvd 1 again
7)open up my computer, and find the mounted cd
8)right click with the mouse and click open.
9)open up the crack folder, and copy the crack
10) paste the crack in the installation directory (which is found when u mount dvd 1 and when you do step 7 and 8. It includes all other files).
11)play

,SynysterShadows,2010-02-05T03:37Z,"I figured it out now. Ill make it simple for people who cant do it. like me =)
1.Copy the crack, which is in My Computer, open the medieval thing and there should be a crack folder, open that and copy the crack. 
2.Close that and open my computer again.      
3.Open the disk drive and scroll down until you find the SEGA folder
4.Open it and then open the Medieval 2 folder and thats were you paste the crack.
Hope that helps."

,Blackgoatee,2010-08-24T03:00Z,"ive figured it out. it's probably a new version of winRAR or something. the ""extracted"" files are not really extracted, they are archived as a winRAR archive, which only winRAR can read. that's apparently called ""extracting"" these days...
you have to open that archive with winRAR to see all the maps and files, and there you will find the crack map."

So,I've been seeing a LOT of people always requesting people to seed.I don't know if you already know about this,but I'll just say it.
So,all you have to do is make the uplode speed higher than you current value.To do that, all you have to do is: 
1. Press CTRL+P on your keyboard.
2. A new window will show up,in that window,go to the ""Bandwith"" table.
3. Now at the Global Uplode Rate Limiting"",change the value of ""Maximum Upload Rate"" to 0 .
4. Now press the ""Apply"" button and than ""OK"".
You're done :D
--But--
If you play any online game,your ping/latency,will raise a LOT,so when you are playing a online game,chnage that value to 1.
When not,chnage it to 0.

I hope this helped.

P.S. : This torrent works great!

,Koenzo,2011-11-24T23:51Z,"Alright, the probably most common problem here is: you followed all steps, but eventually get the error that you need to insert the right disk. 

Here's what to do and this time, it is explained very detailed. Seeing that everybody has proper logic and can manage to follow the steps, I will be continueing from step 5, as it's there where the common problem occurs.

5. Copy the cracked files located in the Crack directory on DVD1 to your
installation directory.

So, you go to the drive, where your mounted it, in my case it is: BD-romstation (H:) MEDIEVAL2 - so, the (H:) station - yours could be (E:), (D:) or what ever. 

Now, the only thing you do, is open the Crack file, copy the item (which is an executable item) medieval2.exe and overwrite it with the same executable file, where you installed the entire game in. 

In my case: Copy the medieval2.exe file, in the crackfolder to Computer->localdisk (C:)->program files->SEGA->Medieval 2 TotalWar and overwrite the file with the medieval2.exe file that is in the file where you installed your game. (You replace the medieval2.exe file in the crackfolder, with the medieval2.exe file in the install folder, they look the same, have the same name, so look carefully). If you have done this, you can click on the new executable you've pasted in the install map and the game will now start. 

I hope this helped, have fun.

,meNinja,2012-01-03T23:08Z,"You extract both folders. When you're done you should have one iso file in each folder. Mount first one then install, the continue with second one then your done. The files are just seperated into smaller ones but when you extract it becomes one iso in the respective folders."
