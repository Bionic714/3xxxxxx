I hate to say that Jubilees of Zion is the weakest of Midnite's first 3 albums, because people might infer that it is a poor set, but that is far from the truth.  In fact, this is an excellent album that maintains the group's rich sound.   It's just that the songs aren't quite as consistently classic as they are on Ras Mek Peace and Unpolished (but they're damn close)
