I downloaded this torrent. But it wont play in either one of my ""players"". I tried it in VLC but the image wont appear and the sound is off and on. You have any advice? My mail is esum1@hotmail.com "
,ernieballesp06,2009-01-27T01:34Z,"hey man the reason VLC and other media players would not work is because the files are RMVB, that means it will only play in real player.  This is gay i know i hate real player, however thats the only way it will work.  The benefit to this is real movie format is conpressed.  So each movie is smaller which is a benefit because it does not take as long to download, however you have to use a shity movie player.  Good luck to ya man 

Peace"
