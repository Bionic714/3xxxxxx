,PapaHotel,2006-11-30T04:15Z,Installer or rip?
,monstert,2006-11-30T20:22Z,"Woops my fault..forgot to mention, its a Rip and not an installer. However its hardly rocket science to install a rip. Drop it in your addon scenery folder and add via FS9 scenery options..ok it, reload FS9 and your done :)"

I need install, please...."
,asad98,2008-10-02T16:29Z,"Don't be an arsehole, pitruka, it really isn't that hard to install. 

Drop it in FS9's addon scenery folder and add using Scenery Library.

Monstert, thanks for a truly amazing upload mate, much indebted to you."

,karank88,2010-08-24T19:13Z,"It's pretty simple. 
Once you have the scenery downloaded, extract all the files to your desktop. See a new folder created ?
Open the folder and minimize it. Now open your FS9 directory and minimize it as well. Go back to your extracted folder and open the first folder (should be 'Aerosoft'). See the 2 folders there ?
Copy them into your 'Addon scenery' folder in FS9 directory.
Now go back to the second folder 'Effects'. Copy all its contents and paste them INSIDE your FS9 effects folder.
If you want default flight plans to show up in your 'Flight planner' mode inside FS9 then copy the flights into FS9 directory. 
Open the modules folder and copy and 'Aerocore.dll' file into your FS9 modules folder. 
Lastly, Open the scenery folder -> Asia -> Scenery and copy the 2 bgl files inside to your FS9 Scenery -> Asia -> scenery folder. 
Overwrite any of the files if prompted.

One last step, start up FS9 and click on settings. 
Click on 'Scenery library' and click on 'Add Area'. Browse to your FS9 addon scenery folder and add the FOLDER as it is. 

All done. Quit flight simulator and start it up again! 
Happy flying :)"
