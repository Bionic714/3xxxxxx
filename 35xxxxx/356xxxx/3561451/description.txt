The original version allowed the player to start companies in several settings: the U.S. West and Midwest or the Northeast, England, and (on a smaller scale including southern England) Europe.

The player, as the manager of the business, must lay track, build stations, purchase and schedule trains, and, if the player wishes, handle individual train movement and build additional industries. The game also has other railroads attempting to put the player out of business by stock dealings as well as by "Rate Wars" between railroads.
