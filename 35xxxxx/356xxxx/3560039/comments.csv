,vl_vista,2006-11-18T19:03Z,"I nuläget finns det bara på dom större språken så som engelska, franska, tyska, japanska m.m. 
Men vi svenskar och finnländare får vänta till det läcker ut ett MUI- språkpaket annars så kan du troligen köpa/ ladda hem det i Januari då Vista lanseras till konsumenter.

Återkommer med mer info om jag får tag på nått. "
,mentalt_frustrert,2006-11-18T19:23Z,när kommer 64 bit edition?
,AndyPany9,2006-11-18T19:32Z,"Slipper man 30dagars perioden med denna versionen eller hur fungerar det, står inte så mkt om det här?"
,torrentadmin,2006-11-18T19:42Z,"Did any one download it? is it true, the MSDN copy?"
,SpookyET,2006-11-18T20:01Z,"If this matches b71e04564ca22e4d9928e59298eff87cf62b382b it's an MSDN copy.  Otherwise, it isn't.
That said, a BillGates to MSDN patch (the real thing, not the crap that was posted a few day ago) would be nice."
,vl_vista,2006-11-18T20:14Z,"1: Vet inte när 64 bit versionen kommer. 
ENG: I have no date when 64- bit arrives.

2: Nej detta är en orörd iso-fil, så aktiveringen slipper ni inte. 
ENG: untouched iso from MSDN.

3: This is the REAL MSDN copy. This was released by Microsoft at MSDN on Friday 17th November. 

4: I do not have the keys or other activation fix, try the others on the filesharing networks. 

5: This release is a 32 - bit english DVD ISO

6: You can install it and use it for 30 days then if you want you could reinstall it.

,torrentadmin,2006-11-18T21:25Z,Thank you vl_vista and downloading ...

[T],DasBot,2006-11-18T21:30Z,Kanske ska tilläggas att checksumman är en sha1 summa och inte en md5 summa. Ifall ngn undrar.
[T],DasBot,2006-11-18T21:31Z,"It's a sha1 checksum, not md5"

Looks legit :0"
,Beresford,2006-11-18T22:55Z,"Microsoft pulled this from MSDN, I had downloaded 65% at a really slow speed the entire weekend and they pulled it. Stupid bastards."
,SpookyET,2006-11-18T22:58Z,"fairlylarge, the md5 you got is correct.
bersford, you can resume it.  replace the iso created by the torrent file with what you have downloaded from MS.  the relaunch the client and tell it to recheck what's been downloaded if it does not do that automatically.  Then it will resume"
,SpookyET,2006-11-18T22:59Z,"Someone, please create a BillGates to legit MSDN patch."

Var hittar man den riktiga RTM från MSDN till följande?

Microsoft Office Enterprise 2007
Microsoft Office Project 2007
Microsoft Office Visio 2007

,SpookyET,2006-11-19T01:21Z,"That's MD5, not SHA1"
,Infa,2006-11-19T03:03Z,"Ledsen för den dumma frågan, MEN :)  jag hajjar ju lite innebörden av LEGIT copy osv ..men vad innebär det egentligen? att om man fixar activeringen så är allt helt ok eller? varför är det så viktigt att den är legit? måste ju lära mig nå nytt varje dag :)

thats the md5 of this file?


the Sha1 Md5 IS ALSO CORRECT and that is what he typed here not the usal md5 ...so you fuck off ..and dont talk like this here u stupid fuck
"
,NecroBeator,2006-11-19T12:20Z,"Fukkk...
So many dif versions out...
Which is the best one so far ???
I wanted to install and use today, thanks..."
,Infa,2006-11-19T12:41Z,well where does it say that this is the copy of 17-11???? can u tell me that? just becouse he uploaded it doesnt say its a release of 17 nov? both md5 sum and sha1 is correct so however this is a legit relase .........12 or 17 nov.. and whats the diffrence anyhow? isnt the same shit anyway?
,PapaDocta,2006-11-19T13:31Z,this is bill gates' release and patched to MSDN.. 
,Infa,2006-11-19T13:43Z,"ok, now i get it ... its a fake msdn ... NOT a real copy that is ..just a converted one ..ok ok... so wheres the real thing then and what md5 does it got .."
,vl_vista,2006-11-19T15:20Z,"This is the real iso file from the MSDN and it was published by MS at 17th nov on MSDN. This iso is not fake, i have install it and everything works fine, tested both from XP and from clean disk.

The both numbers (MD5 and SHA1) is NOT manipulated. 
There is so many other releases that has been manipulated. 

Just downlad it and install it and evalute Windows Vista for free in 30 days until you get a patch or a valid key to activate it. 

The meaning with this release was to get those  MSDN subs. a alternative way to download it. And for all others you may evalute it. 

I can't understand why some people says that this is fake. 

// vl_vista"
,Infa,2006-11-19T15:31Z,so the activation workaround doesnt work for this release? that one that replaces the 2 files so u can activate it with rc1 key?
,crtrials,2006-11-19T15:39Z,"CRC32: C11363AA

This is the genuine msdn release."
,Infa,2006-11-19T15:45Z,"that wasnt what i ment ... one of the first copys of the rtm's that was out did have an activation crack so u could use it for 6 months or soo..it did replase 2 license files so you could activate it with a rc1 key, couse there is no key for this rtm releases that will work ... and my question were do this work for this 2? and with this iso u dont have to patch eyy? its a genuine iso that dont need to be patched?"
,Ooss,2006-11-19T16:49Z,"Well... correct me if I'm wrong but the new patch for billgates gives you the right MD5 and SHA1 (MSDN), right?

So... like infa said, how can we know that this torrent is the MSDN release and not just a patched billgates?

I don't want an iso that was manipulated..."
,Infa,2006-11-19T18:14Z,"As i get it,  theres no way to find out if its a patched one or real one? the checksum are still the same? gotta be something so u can reqognize which is which? "
,SpookyET,2006-11-19T18:48Z,"There is no way to know, and it does not matter.  If the hash matches, the data is identical.  You cannot have 2 different data streams with the same hash.  Well, theoretically it is possible, but these hash algorithms have not yet been cracked.  There was talk about it, but there has  been no proof of concept.

So, stop worrying."
,lioncat,2006-11-19T19:00Z,"hur funkar det med serienr och activation...de här är ju bara en iso-fil...på själva OS
kanske kan UL ge lite tips  :)"
,Infa,2006-11-19T20:06Z,"ok thanx spookey ... and about serials ...there are severals crack out there so search and you will find :) happy visting! :D i still barely cant play any games, thats the only sad thing about this os so far :( "
,davenator,2006-11-20T01:56Z,"PapaDocta was correct. This is merely a Bill Gates version patched as MSDN.
Sure.....the hashes are the way they should be, but they`ve clearly been manipulsted. I Opened up the files on the disk of Bill Gates and they state that they (the files) were last modified on November 2......the very same as vl_vista`s ""MSDN"". vl_vista.....don`t fill people full of your shit. You are just wasting our bandwidth. "
,SpookyET,2006-11-20T02:51Z,"PapaDocta, don't be a moron!  The hash matches the hash of the MSDN release; therefore, the data is  IDENTICAL. SHA-1 and MD5 have no known collisions yet."
,SpookyET,2006-11-20T02:52Z,"STUPID noobs, READ on what a HASH function is: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function"
,DrakeM5,2006-11-20T04:20Z,"SpookyET: Maybe YOU should READ: ""On the other hand, a hash function is not injective, i.e. the equality of two hash values ideally strongly suggests, but does not guarantee, the equality of the two inputs.""

Stop talking so much trash."

,SpookyET,2006-11-20T17:43Z,Then compare the fucking bits one by one. THERE ARE NO KNOWN COLLISIONS.

If you have trouble read this.
i had rc1 with valid cd key and installed the bill gates rtm version. well as soon as it booted i had to enter a valid key, and nothing worked and it wouldnt let me log in.

luckily i could dual boot to xp and apply the patch. i just changed admin privledges and copied the 2 files over i needed. this is the patch that worked
http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3555654/
and when i logged in i didnt even have to activate my copy it was actived already wityh my old rc1 key.
if you dont have vista on another partition maybe you can copy the files from a bootdisk of somesort."
,skowfritt,2006-11-30T23:24Z,"I`ve had it with Hosta La Vista. Oh, I was able to activate it alright but whats the point? Vista is nothing but one large overbloated turkey. I`ve got 2 peripheral devices I can`t even use with it. An OS that hogs 10 gigabytes on your hard drive. The hell with it."

Is this the VISTA RTM build 6000 or something earlier to it? "
