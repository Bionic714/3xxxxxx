TULL TURKEY DAY SPECIAL

XM STUDIOS ORIGINAL BROADCAST



23/11/04 XM Studios Washington DC, USA 


  Performing the entire 'Aqualung' album live for 'Then...Again...Live!', in front of an invited audience of 40.
First b.cast 16/1/05.
Played in the following order, to be reorganised into album order for the broadcast.
Cheap Day Return, Mother Goose, Wond'ring Aloud, Slipstream, Aqualung, Cross-Eyed Mary, Up To Me, My God, Hymn 43, 

Locomotive Breath, Wind-Up
'Slipstream' and 'Hymn 43' were 'Supstream' and 'Humn 43' on the cuesheet.
Martin's guitar malfunctioned during 'Slipstream' so it was played again. Likewise, Ian couldn't see Doane at the start 

of 'Locomotive Breath', so missed his cue; it was cut short and restarted.
This was the first time Andrew had played the absolutely full version of 'Wind Up' live.
