Do you think it is wise to have a website that indicates all the pirated software and XP together on one disk.

Do you not think M$ will find it and maybe be a little annoyed, especially with you saying its all free and download.

Thanks anyway and take care."
,CSIWEMBLEY,2006-11-26T22:50Z,"i agree with madjock111, although visiting the said website, offered very little, perhaps M$ have cought up already.

Good job though, thanks :-)"

,Amerialb,2006-12-22T15:41Z,"I was very dissapointed I could not install the version of Windows Xp. I am using a test machine that just has an iWill motherboard, 1.5g AMD, 32m AGP video card, and an IDE HD, with 256m dim.

Keeps giving the BSOD with the error

BAD_POOL_CALLER

I suspect it is a driver that one of the driver packs is forcing windows to load that is not compatible with my motherboard."
