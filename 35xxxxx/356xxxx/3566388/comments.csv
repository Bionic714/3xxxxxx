,Osaka,2006-11-28T09:42Z,What a load of disinformation BS.
,toofan,2006-11-28T10:35Z,thanks for this :)
,p2P2p,2006-11-28T17:02Z,"Hey Osaka - have you actually watched this documentary? To be honest it is actually the most balanced one I have seen so far on Iran, there is plenty of disinfo out there, but (if you had read the file comments) Ted Koppel reported from Iran for 444 days straight during the Iranian US Embassy Crisis 27 years ago so he certainly can bring something to the debate.

Try not to slander any file/video unless you have seen it. Ok? Why not watch the interview link provided first and then decide if this torrent might be worth downloading. I hope you enjoy this documentary...  :)"
,p2P2p,2006-11-28T17:34Z,"Oh, and I should probably mention that the title ""The Most Dangerous Nation"" apparently comes from a G.W.Bush comment to a German news reporter. Iran is a proud nation, with much history, culture and intelligence - it is a shame we don't know more about them."
,amiraza,2007-01-06T05:40Z,"haha. Yes the nation is wrong word! you should say THE REGIM! ye. Im from Iran and I hat it ""not nation"""
,p2P2p,2007-01-08T00:48Z,"Yes, that's a good point, while the people of Iran seem to be very diverse, interesting and determined to improve their situation, the documentary does touch on the fact that many Iranians are not overly happy with their President's use of religious and racial rhetoric for political gain and global standing - a feeling which is shared by many people in the USA regarding their own President.
