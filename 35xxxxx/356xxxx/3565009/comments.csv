,Adfest,2006-11-30T21:23Z,Good to know. The 99.9% was stressing me out a bit. So long as all the roms work I'm just ducky. Thanks.

,unrealt3_93,2008-01-13T21:31Z,DONT DL THIS IT CONTAINS A TROJAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
,MasterofX,2008-02-09T14:04Z,"DONT DL THIS IT CONTAINS A TROJAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 

NOT TRUE, I'm the original poster of this pack, it used to be found on most torrent sites but had problems with some stuff and i removed them.
the only place left is here and torrentspy i believe (if it's on another site then i didn't upload it)

Don't panic about the 99.9% it's NORMAL, like i said in the first post there were some problems during the creation but NO FILES ARE MISSING except for VBA Link witch is used to emulate the link cable.
All roms are present, categorized, working and including some extras to create own roms and tools to modify them.
I'm happy to see that over a year my torrent is still appreciated (except the 99.99% part :) sorry about that).
If demonoid ever comes back there should be a 100% vers in case the torrents are kept
P.S. to the person with the Trojan, if you have heuristic enabled it might be that it only BELIEVES to be a Trojan, i had many cases where the any-virus believed that, when in reality it was just the code that APPEARED suspicious."
,JottePD,2008-02-15T10:14Z,Great! Thanks a lot!
,JottePD,2008-02-15T11:08Z,"This torrent is great! Great games and everything!

Please, everybody, seed as much as you can! :D"

,MasterofX,2008-03-31T00:47Z,"""please seed somebody anybody everybody seed""

lol, well, you basically can't seed spmething like this since it's not completed, but i will start uploading a new ROM pack with 100% Completion ^_^ so no more panicking from ppl who see only 99% >:)

This is only if i get around 10 ppl requesting this, and i might add some extras in the pack...who knows, so start posting"
,VileCore,2008-06-04T03:27Z,"""seed, seed, seed, seed"". Don't you people read? Look at what MasterofX said at the very beginning. Muppets."
