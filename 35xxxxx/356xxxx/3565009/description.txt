Categorized GBA Roms Including a couple of emulators like Visual Boy Advance, VBA Link for multyplayer support, Game saves, Bios, cheats for some games...
Most of the files needed to be packed for the torrent to be smaller so i apologize in advance if some don't like it packed like this.
This collection is not complete, some games i didn't like have been deleted and some i've never had to test but still it contains around 1000 ROMs
Enjoy!!!
