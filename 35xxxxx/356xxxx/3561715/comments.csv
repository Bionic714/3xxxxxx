,i2mfan,2006-11-23T01:28Z,"I will upload S3 but I don't know when(days or 1 week). :( They(the channel) missed a couple of episode and I have to wait for it to re-aired on another channel that is a little behind. Both are almost airing daily. I just hope  they don't cancel the show on either channel. 

For now, I uploaded Vanished(Webrip) and thank to the US? ripper.


In the meantime,  check the other video I uploaded but seeded by the community and not by me anymore. Thanks guys! 

You don't need a great speed to start contributing. :) I only got 25k/s, the help of the others and a tools like Info 2 MIS(tv.com,imdb.com ...) to make this easy.

,i2mfan,2006-11-23T20:00Z,"Dennis_Olof, you made some good point but

I can't support to seed a whole season by myself because of my slow upload speed(25k/s). Right now, it takes me 7 hours to seed 1 episode. Imagine 22 at the same time. Also, I want to offer and download other stuff. I don't want my bandwidth(upload) used 100% of the time. 

I think, in my case, it's simpler to go 1 by 1 because each torrent is kept alive and does not requires days to the leecher to reach 1:1. 

If someone want to make 1 big torrent for each seasons, you are more than welcome. Just delete the .TXT(not needed) and keep the rest.  The good .MIS for season 2 are in the last torrent. I could redo the .MIS for season 1 and email it to that person.

DVD: 
Profit 8 episodes on DVD (good and still current. With the Politician from Heroes Adrian Pasdar )

First Wave 66 episodes and not on DVD(legally anyway)."
,i2mfan,2006-11-25T13:26Z,"Flat-rate but capped and uncapped depending on the package.

They started to cap here new comers(rumors?). I don't know if I will be capped because I'm not on a contract. 

At least many part of the world(cities) start to have high-speed. But it's harder in rural area where the cost is higher. Maybe Wimax will help.

I should be starting S03 soon(Maybe Today)."
,alibaba12,2006-11-25T13:53Z,Thank you so much for all this!
,firstfan,2006-11-25T14:32Z,"Many thanks, canÂ´t wait for S3.  Had found it before but the quality is bad and most of the ep. corrupted.  CouldnÂ´t even get it to work with VLC."
