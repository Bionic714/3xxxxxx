Plot:

This spoof of prehistoric man movies, follows outcasts, Atouk and Lar, as they meet
and join up with other outcasts to form their own tribe. The new tribe includes a blind
man, a gay couple, a dwarf, and other oddball outcasts rejected by other tribes.
But Atouk still longs to be with Lana, the beautiful mate of Tonda, the leader who kicked
him out of his tribe.

AMAZON.COM review:

Yes, that's a former Beatle in caveman costume for this more-dumb-than-funny 1981 comedy
about a prehistoric misfit (Ringo Starr) who recruits other misfits to start a new tribe.
The jokes about flatulence and sex are banal, but the cast of then-unfamiliar faces is fun to
watch from the perspective of history. The best thing going are some dinosaur special effects,
though Ringo might argue meeting his future wife (Barbara Bach) was a good deal.
