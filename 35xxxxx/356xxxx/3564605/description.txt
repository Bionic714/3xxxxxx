Inside the Vatican: National Geographic Goes Behind the Public Facade
National Geographic Channel 2004

The Vatican may be one of the most famous places in the world, but it's also among the most mysterious; very few people have seen what lies beyond the Vatican's walls, and even fewer journalists have had free access to the tiny walled city that is the home of the Catholic Church. In 2001, National Geographic was given permission to enter the Vatican with a camera crew, and National Geographic: Inside The Vatican examines the city's 2000 years of history, as well as documenting the Vatican's historical archives and documenting private chapels which had never before been photographed to viewing by the public. Martin Sheen serves as host and narrator. ~ Mark Deming, All Movie Guide
