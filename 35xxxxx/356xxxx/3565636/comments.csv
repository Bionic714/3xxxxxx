,meigi,2006-11-27T00:08Z,Thanks for the share .
[V],Exlo,2006-11-27T01:09Z,Thanks!
,ymmota,2006-12-03T16:54Z,"seed please.
Stack on 98.6%"
,Brown34,2006-12-03T18:08Z,"Yes - Seed pleeze!
98,5%"
,uraphake,2006-12-03T18:41Z,"I believe mrSpaceman has left the solar system (after 7 days) never to return. In my opinion, had he not chosen to use ""super seeding"" we would have been completed days ago. The only thing ""super"" about it is that it's ""super slow."" With any luck, perhaps a kind alien will return him to us along with the missing 1.5 percent remainder."
,kawmic,2006-12-03T20:17Z,Could u seed again mrSpaceman? A lot of us is stuck at 99%!!
,Felfy,2006-12-04T22:38Z,"Yup - Same here, stuck at 99%

Please seed

Many thanks
Felfy"
,Felfy,2006-12-04T22:47Z,"UPDATE

It looks like a Seeder has logged on - Many thanks

I've also previewed this, (at 99%), in Power DVD & it still looks and sounds GREAT!

Thanks again to MrSpaceman"
,uraphake,2006-12-05T18:00Z,"I would gladly thank mrSpaceman if he would only finish what he started.
As of now, I give him bupkus."
,uraphake,2006-12-06T12:14Z,"Okay mrSpaceman, I take back the bupkus.
Thank you for this share -- I appreciate it very much. It took a long time but in the end it was worth it.

Tip: Next time don't use super seeding."
,mrSpaceman,2006-12-08T22:11Z,"Hey, sorry for the trouble but i cannot be online 24/7!

And if the statistics are correct there are currently more seeders than leechers!

And third: Good things need their time... be patient!  :)"

damn spaceman....."
,mrSpaceman,2007-03-15T23:18Z,"@grek1: Maybe you have a lot of hash errors (i.e. the packages you have received are corrput) therefor the high amount of download.

This could have a lot of reasons... You could try another program though.

A lot of people have successfully downloaded this movie so far!"
,cool_jay,2007-04-11T00:32Z,GREAT MOVIE THANK YOU SO MUCH !!!! RECOMMEND THIS TO ALL 
,cool_jay,2007-04-11T00:32Z,THOUGH THE STORY IS NOT TRUE WE WERE ALL CREATED BY GOD AND ONLY GOD
,cool_jay,2007-04-11T00:33Z,BUT WRONG STORY WE WERE ALL CREATED BY GOD
,mrSpaceman,2007-05-06T01:31Z,"No, you got that wrong: Men created god!  :D"
,y3n007,2007-09-07T09:30Z,"I agree with Mrspaceman, man created God, can wait to finish down loadling what sounds to be a great file to keep till I die, and then some. By the way, stop bringing religion where it does not belong, this is just a VID with someones perspective is you don't like the way the reason, don't challenge it, just enjoy what you got and shut the f&%* up. And one more thing religious people have no reason to download this or any other file, by doing so you are already doing something your bible told you was wrong to do, go buy it so you don't brake any commandments. "
,cool_jay,2007-10-20T21:40Z,"You´re very wrong, God IS the greatest, 
you´ll see, MARK MY WORDS, you´ll see...
´God has given you beautiful trees so that you can breathe, why dont you believe?´ 
´God has given you fresh water to drink, why dont you believe?´
´God has given you animals to eat so that you can survive in,why dont you believe?´ 
´God has given you a Big life with friends, relatives,memories from that little embro you were, but you still do not believe...´"
,cool_jay,2007-10-20T21:45Z,"Stupid cunts like y3n007 and mrSpaceman will never enjoy life as we humans were born to enjoy, they will never experience the beautiful things with religions, though they´re hearts are locked in a barricade, and will always be untill the truth reveals to them, but then it will be to late."
,mrSpaceman,2007-11-10T20:30Z,"Hey cool_jay, did your parents beat you or cut off your cock? I'm just asking... you kinda sound like that..."
,goldilox77,2007-11-30T19:48Z,"Why bring that up! it just causes arguments!?

Thanks for the film! "
,kbl247,2007-12-06T19:42Z,"i just can't finish that damn download....
stuck @ 99.9 since forever

303 hashfails -> 1.2GB wasted data

wtf?"
,lizardking420,2008-04-02T09:23Z,"gotta love those 38.100.x.x guys aye?
weird i only notice em on pink floyd torrents....."
,hamidmp3,2008-07-22T18:32Z,does this also have the orignial Audio track or just the pink dub?
,smileysmile,2008-08-05T08:51Z,"Many thanks for this and for also including the subtitles. Although throughout the whole length of the film there is only 40 minutes of dialogue, the subtitles are a great bonus in following the story.

Cheers"
,mrSpaceman,2008-08-24T22:26Z,"@hamidmp3: It has only the PF audio, no original audio, but that would be a wonderful idea! Maybe I make that sometimes, so that you can choose which audio track you want to have...

@smileysmile: That's exactly why I added the subs  ;)

@webbersley: I think there are more seeders than just one. People who like the movie keep on seeding to increase the distribution. However, they are not always online. Just be patient."
,foota1,2010-04-16T15:30Z,"Just a quick one I AM going to seed this for the rest of my life!! everyone should see it.
I did buy this a few years back and someone stole it from me so iwas over the moon to find this torrent.
What an excelent job you have done here up-most respect to you and your kind!!
PEACE!"
