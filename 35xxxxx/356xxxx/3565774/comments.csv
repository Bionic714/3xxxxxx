,cyberax2650,2008-06-05T07:56Z,I am happy with english but my keyboard is danish (I live in Denmark). You would make your upload usable by a more universal range of people if you would keep the other keyboards layout friend!
,esotericx10,2008-12-25T17:33Z,"For the guy stuck at 97.8%, this may not be the best solution, but it may be the only solution. Go to the list of files on your torrent client, see which files haven't completely downloaded, and if you can live without those files, delete them! Then, remove the torrent and use it. Just make sure you do reseed at least a 1.5 ratio

I've had to do that on more than one occasion"
