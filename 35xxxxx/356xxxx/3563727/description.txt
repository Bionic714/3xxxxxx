The cryptic videos for "Sober" and "Prison Sex" provided the initial glimpse of the dark imaginations of Tool. While Undertow made the band popular, Ænima made them a phenomenon. The album stunned audiences in 1996 and brought the avant-garde to the mainstream. Complex instrumental passages echoed Pink Floyd. Cryptic lyrics rewarded thoughtful listening. And the band?s intense performances were decidedly metal. Ænima launched Tool into their own universe. Ten years later, it is still a worthwhile visit.

The String Quartet Tribute to Tool?s Ænima is a breathtaking journey through Tool?s masterpiece. A handpicked group of musicians have used violins, viola, and cello to explore the emotional depths of such songs as "Forty-Six & 2" and "Third Eye." Each movement of the bow elicits moody and nuanced notes. These string interpretations prove that Tool are truly modern day composers.
