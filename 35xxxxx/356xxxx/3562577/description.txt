Advanced Archive Password Recovery v3.01 EN/RUS	
	 
Advanced Archive Password Recovery (or ARCHPR) is a program to recover lost or forgotten passwords to archives (compressed files) of the following types: ZIP/PKZip/WinZip, ARJ/WinARJ, ACE/WinACE (1.x), RAR/WinRAR.

The key features of ARCHPR are:

    * The program has a convenient user interface
    * The program is very fast: for ZIP with traditional encryption, brute-force attack speed is up to fifteen million passwords per second on modern CPUs like Pentium 4 (Prescott)
    * Guaranteed decryption (usually, within the hour) of many WinZip archives (created in versions 8.0 and below, with 5+ encrypted files) is available; it works regardless the password complexity and length
    * The program can work with archives containing only one encrypted file
    * Archives created by various software packages are supported
    * Strong WinZip encryption (AES) is supported
    * Self-extracting archives are supported
    * The program is customizable: you can set the password length (or length range), the character set to be used to generate the passwords, and a couple of other options
    * You can select the custom character set for brute-force attack (non-English characters are supported)
    * Dictionary-based attack (with word mutations) is available
    * The \\\\\\\"brute-force with mask\\\\\\\" attack is available
    * Very fast known-plaintext attack is available (ZIP and ARJ only)
    * You can interrupt the program at any time, and resume from the same point later
    * The program can work in the background, using the CPU only when it is in idle state
