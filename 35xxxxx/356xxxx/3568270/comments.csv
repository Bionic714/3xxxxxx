Comics is usually a male thing. Boys and men read them and like them while women often consider it ""nerdy"".

Does this also comply to adult comics? These comics are often very brutal too (rape, bondage, murder, incest and so on) - so its not the ""love and romance"" thing that women usually like...

Please make a comment if there are any women downloding these comics. Whats your opinion? I am curious..."

,2point,2006-12-02T03:44Z,"The American & European comics are usually boy comics, and the largest selection of Japanese comics/manga are Sh?nen, that is action comics aimed at young boys. 

But there are quite many, especially in japan - comics for girl (Sh?jo), and women (Josei).  

There are plenty of erotic manga for girl, and not to mention romantic manga - as that is largely the base of operations for these two fields of comics (they do contain other subject matters though). 

I simply thing it has to do with the fact that it can be done, for doing a Hilda for film would probably be horrible to look at, even if they managed to portray it well. For even the most brutal comics I've seen are not life like, and do not invoke the same nausea as a photo would do. 

Now Hilda & crew is probably aimed at young men, aka why I download it, but at the same time I might guess that it would hit harder with the masochistic female ;) "
,tooTiredtoo,2006-12-07T10:41Z,There are probably no masochist females here then - or they are very shy ;)

,gefufna2,2007-01-03T18:37Z,Any other comics from Hanz Kovacq?
,tooTiredtoo,2007-01-09T14:43Z,"Apart from Diane 1-2 also posted here on piratebay, I dont know about any except for a couple of short ones (2-3 images accompanied by a lot of text). Sorry..."
,JemiSilver,2007-11-04T19:50Z,"tooTiredtoo, I'm a woman and I enjoy these adult comics. Maybe it's because I'm bisexual and likes to be dominated, I have never been in to those romantic things that most women like...

Thanks for the comics :) "
