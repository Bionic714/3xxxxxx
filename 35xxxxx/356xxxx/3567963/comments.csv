,Osaka,2006-12-13T03:45Z,"I'm currently seeding this: http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3575057/

So I won't have any time to seed anything else, including the Final Fantasy soundtracks (or the Silent Hill OSTs for that matter) for some time now.

Please seed all the FF soundtracks after you've downloaded them for at least a few days, or weeks even if you can."
,Pkylan,2006-12-19T09:01Z,"gr8 upload, dumb format though..."
,Osaka,2006-12-22T15:04Z,"No, it's not. It's superior.

The only better would be a lossless codec (FLAC for example)."
,magsexymf,2006-12-22T23:05Z,quite good format actually. great sound quality
,CursedGroin,2007-01-10T19:13Z,"Why zip it? I ruins the possibility to choose single songs to download, for example if you want to test if the songs work with your player.. Or if you just want to prioritize a certain song."
,Osaka,2007-01-20T01:01Z,"If you don't zip it, most people will just download all the songs then MOVE the files to another location (such as their music folder), thus rendering the torrent un-seedable from their side.

A zip will remain and when they unpack the files they can move them around how much they want and still be able to seed and share back."
,Amarth41269,2007-05-31T15:20Z,"Osaka ever heard of copying? If ppl really does care, they will just wait for the ratio to become 1.0, and then move on, or then just copy the songs into other folder. Or delete the originals if they dont care about seeding. Anyhow, its not good to post songs in rar."
,Osaka,2007-06-02T13:07Z,"Amarth41269, you don't seem to understand much... and you don't seem to have much experience with making torrents either.

The reason I zipped it is NOT to compress it further (duh), but rather just BECAUSE I made a torrent of it...

If you don't zip it, most people will just download all the songs then MOVE the files to another location (such as their music folder), thus rendering the torrent un-seedable from their side.

This is a proven FACT.

You're free to have whatever OPINION you want about it, but that won't change the facts, sorry."
,smartguywithabeard,2007-08-16T01:04Z,"Of course there are the others of us out there that hate .rar torrents and purposely don't seed them. I seed almost everything I get that's not rared to >1.0, but rars I use my torrent client to COMPLETELY remove all the files once un-packed ;) It's stupid to waste twice the hardrive space. Just stupid.
Also, if the files arent compressed there is no reason not to download the them directly to the target folder in the first place.

Anyways..."
,Osaka,2007-08-23T04:03Z,"Get a shave.

...by the way, where are your torrents?

lol... *rolls eyes*"
,Biosaur,2007-11-22T16:06Z,"More seeders would be nice...

 I'd love to seed this myself for a day or so ( Sadly, thats the most I can do ) but in order to do that I NEED SEEDS! :P"
,bshs_matt08,2008-10-27T16:16Z,"i think Amarth41269 plainly forgot about noobs...   ...it happens, but yes, the main reason that said files get moved, instead of copied is either due to noobage or just a plain lack of space (standing up for non-noob poor ppl). yes, it would be beneficial to have a sample file outside of the zip, but that's way to much forthsight of a pirate...   ...i'm just happy for the torrent itself, thanks Osaka!"
,Osaka,2009-09-09T14:25Z,"Yes, if people chose the correct download location (meaning that they save the data were they intend to keep it later), or in other words, didn't move the stuff, then there would of course be no need to make .zips.

Zipping sucks, but thanks to lazy people who forget to delete the original .zip after extraction, the torrent survives.. "
,zenofosa,2010-03-16T07:54Z,Thanks for the upload Osaka. I always loved the music from final fantasy x. I will seed for along time.
,teo829,2010-04-01T07:55Z,wao thanks for the soundtrack man.  Your torrent is the only dependable one left!  I shall seed.
,teo829,2010-04-01T20:32Z,"oh and if you guys are having trouble opening the mpc extension file, use this free converter:  

http://www.mymusictools.com/articles/how-do-i-convert-mpc-to-mp3.htm

1. Download and use trial option
2. You can converter 10 mpc files to mp3 at once.
3.  It's fast and it worked for me
4.  You can set your mp3 to mp3 converted files to play at the highest bitrate as well (320 kbps!!)
5. Enjoii"
,datone1guy,2010-10-20T02:05Z,"Hello everyone.  I downloaded this torrent and am seeding it now because the sound quality is amazing.  Sadly, I wanted to pass it along to my iPhone so that I can listen to it anywhere I go, but iTunes doesn't even support a plugin that plays mpc files, so I need to convert the file to aac, mp4 or mp3.  I would rather convert it to aac since this format preserves more of the sound quality than mp3 or mp4.  Does anyone know of a free program that can do that?  Any response would be great.  Oh, and I already tried the audio converter recommended here, but it only converts to mp3.  Thanks again."
,newbie01,2011-04-21T00:35Z,@datone1guy: try using dBpoweramp
,uz3rnaim3,2012-06-15T22:13Z,"Love you, quality was amazing, and it syncs perfectly with my mp3, and .rar doesn't mean crap, if you want the file so bad stop complaining, because here is a secret. . . IT'S FREE."
