,mqduck,2006-11-20T00:17Z,"Sorry all, my ISP seems to have cut my upload bandwidth. So it may be awhile before the full thing is flying around in BitTorrent land, but come hell or high water, I'll get it there."
,mqduck,2006-11-20T01:01Z,"Okay, problem solved. Some time last night I somehow set the upload limit for the torrent to 1kb/s and failed to notice until now."
