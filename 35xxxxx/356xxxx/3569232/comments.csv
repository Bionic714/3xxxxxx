If you have Windows Vista, open the ISO file you download in Daemon Tools.
Now go to your emulated drive, press open.
Copy all the files inside there to a new folder.
Then right click on ""autorun"" and choose Compability, Now click Run this program in compability modus for Windows XP.
Press OK and close.
Now run it.
You should be able to install it.
HF with this old legendary game."
,sampom,2008-04-19T17:46Z,I did resolve the autorun.exe problem by Transfering from the deamon emule to a folder on C:\ and then setting autorun.exe to Win 98 compatibility mode (NOT XP)
