,enjourni,2006-12-08T22:22Z,Can you still use windiz update (windowsupdate.62nds.com)?
,Dill Hole,2006-12-09T01:53Z,"to change (UK) english to (american) english...windows/settings/control panel/regional language settings/click ""advanced""/ add/ US english/ then select US english/ apply etc..."
,RoninXI,2006-12-09T22:35Z,"Ok i already know how to change my keyboard layout (i use japanese quite a bit).  I went to change it to american keyboard layout and I get the error...

Windows could not properly load the English(United States) keyboard layout.

I tried several other layouts and nothing but that same error when I hit [ apply ].  

I am stuck not able to type the [ \ ] key all I get is the [ # ] so i hit the [ # ] sign and get [ ÂŁ ] so it is more than just flipped, I tried every button there just isn't one.  I use [ \\192.168.x.x ] to access another computer on my network.

If anyone has any ideas let me know as I am at a loss without being able to switch layouts."
,RoninXI,2006-12-09T22:55Z,"ok I figured it out the run command is messing with the keys and changing it.  

I thought i could add the other languages from my origional XP disk and it will add the fonts but as expected from M$ it won't put in the input support (keyboard). I guess this isn't going to work for me but it is still very interesting.  If I didn't need the support i would be all about using this."
,Schlingel,2006-12-10T16:10Z,"Thanks for all your work eXperience !!

,monkeypup,2006-12-10T21:29Z,"I recently downloaded Tiny xp (rev 05), and I love it! But, there is one problem I can't seem to fix. I get this error when trying to install Windows Media Player 11: ""an error occurred while copying file sysmain.sdb""

I personally hate WMP, but I need it (or Zune, which displays the same error message) to sync with my Xbox 360. Any advice?

Thanks so much for this great version of xp! You rock!
"
,monkeypup,2006-12-11T00:47Z,"Nevermind the last comment. When I went to WMP, it was version 11. So, it must have worked, despite the error each time I tried to install it. Xbox connected and working. 

This is the greatest version of windows ever. Thanks!"
,EnergizerRabbit,2006-12-11T15:32Z,So... I have an old computer that can't boot from the CDROM drive.  Where is the setup.exe program that I can run on the CD after I boot from a floppy?
[V],OlaNorman,2006-12-18T23:31Z,Will this work on my IBM ThinkPad T60 ?? (Just need the drivers of course..)
,kenny_starfight,2006-12-22T09:59Z,"I think that this is fake. Not eXPerience33 who has put this torrent here, and my brother found a trojan on his installation. Anyone else found a trojan?"
,Jolup,2006-12-23T14:36Z,How do I add the PCMCIA support?
,mahdi83,2006-12-25T11:15Z,Is this real or not?Have trojans inside?
,mattchazz,2006-12-27T03:53Z,"NO, there are no trojans.  You people do this everytime with TinyXP.  Experience uses a script to make it an unattended install. He's made it available for anyone to check the actual code -- but inevitably everytime he releases a new TinyXP people scream Trojans.  

IF you are not sure this is a true eXPerience release, test the ISO check sum included. If there is no ISO checksum, THEN be worried. "

How did you get the Windows Update funtion working?"
,buba2523,2006-12-28T11:17Z,"FAST AND FUSRIOUS!!!!! Thanks a ton!!!! I only have one issue. I am not able to access it through the network. It is on the network and I can access my other PC through it but not the other way round. It gave me a a login window a couple of times, then it started cutting me off without even asking for password and login name. Can this be accessed from another PC through LAN and if yes  what da I need to do???  Thanks again!!!! "
,buba2523,2006-12-29T12:13Z,"Got that sorted! Simple filesharing was not turned on by default. I also created a new user account - the same that I use to log on ty my other PC, and turned off the firewall. It is fast and behaves great so far. I hope it stays like that!!!!! Thanks!"
,mahdi83,2006-12-30T22:12Z,Did anyone found how to fix the US keyboard problem??
,Bacardi991,2007-01-01T01:52Z,"hey,  I AM USING WIRELESS NETWORK AEGIS PROTOCOL, WHY I CAN'T INSTALL SOFTWARE AND USE INTERNET??? MAYBE THIS WINDOWS DO NOT SUPPORTING WI-FI??? "
,dpg3,2007-01-17T21:05Z,"I've seen several comments saying, ""The fastest XP I ever used !! "" I'm just wondering how this compares to Tiny XP ver 04 which I am currently using? Is it worth it to switch to ver 5, is it that much better than ver 4? "
,staxstax,2007-01-17T22:58Z,doesn't work for my P1-laptop unfortunately - says ASM.386 missing or something

,metallica71,2007-01-23T22:12Z,guys could you help me? my iso image burns with alcohol and nero are not working. I do not have any setup.exe files on the whole cd. and it does not not boot up when the appropriate boot sequence is used. where am I going wrong? a virtual cd with alcohol/power iso doesnt work either. appreciate your input. cheers
,dtr1,2007-01-31T23:06Z,"Okay, this may sound stupid but how do you get this onto a cd?  Someone loaned me an older version that doesn't support networking which pretty much makes it useless to me.  How do I get this rev 05 onto a cd to boot up a new harddrive?

I have downloaded thru this ""torrent 1.6""  - now what? I open the download and get an ISO file, an Fsum and a cmd.  ???  Need to make a bootable CD or DVD for fresh install."
,newbpcman,2007-02-09T12:12Z,im new to os coping and i cant figure out how to make this torrent into an iso file to run off a freind let me use his copy on my pc and now i need a new 1 plz tell me how 
,marktheboogieman,2007-02-14T00:53Z,"Man, I downloaded this and installed it, but all I get are freakin errors.  I can't install anything, it keeps giving me not a valid win32 application error with everything.  I downloaded windows defender, and it won't let me update, I try to install wmp 11 and it gives me a bsod saying page default in non page area or something like that.  I can't do anything with it.  I can't view anything that uses flash player on the web like myspace and what not.  I hope there is a fix for all this, it's a neat thing and installs very quicky and runs fast.  If anyone knows please help!"
,s0puli,2007-02-28T19:26Z,How do I make themes work with this?
,jaqaq,2007-03-15T00:14Z,Is it possible to install office 2007 on this package?
,RBFM,2007-04-04T21:37Z,"I like these TinyXP operating systems, my old thinkpad r40 thinks it is its birthday!
but who is limiting their upload speeds!?, your forgiven if your on dialup, I've got 6 with a 100% and only getting 1KB/s from one of them, come on!

Thanks for shareing eXPerience/Maffisoft!"
,Nirulda,2007-04-10T23:20Z,win xp sp2 has tcp/ip connection limit upto 10 connections. whether this limit has been extended to 100 connections in this tiny xp edition or not? because for bittorrent downloads it is VERY important.
,jaberwocky6669,2007-05-29T21:09Z,Does the 'Local Users and Groups' found under 'Computer Management'  work on everyone's copy of rev 5? It doesn't work on mine.
