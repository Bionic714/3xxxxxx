,punch,2007-03-14T20:53Z,Hi! Thanks for a very fast download:D but.. I dont understand this crack.exe thing.. i have installed the obejctdock.exe.. and then i have run this crack.exe.. and i have restarted my computer.. then this activation windows comes up.. what maile and serial do i have to use?
,Galileo_2005,2007-03-15T17:03Z,"Inside crack.exe there are 2 files that you need to copy into the instalation folder of ObjectDock. I have them in a self instruct rar but if you have changed the installation folder of objectdock then when running crack.exe you should choose the correct folder. Uninstall objectdock, delete the installation folder and start over."
