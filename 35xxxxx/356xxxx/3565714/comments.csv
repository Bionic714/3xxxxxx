,drewbacca,2007-01-21T22:56Z,I'll seed too when done.  GREAT movie.  Get some people over and have a bawl [sic].
,drewbacca,2007-01-21T22:59Z,"Can anyone tell me how to get srt file to work with this film?  The subs seem to get more and more ""off"" as the film goes along.  By about halfway through, it's unwatchable."
,hemisphere,2007-12-09T21:36Z,are the subs watchable?
,Jabinya,2009-02-16T11:15Z,"Crazy good movie! Unlike anything I have ever seen before!

I used XBMC on winXP and never had any troubles with the subs."
,Zcinity,2010-11-03T12:24Z,"Thanks for the upload/seeds downloaded with 2,5 mb/s!"
,AFinalDate,2010-11-07T04:46Z,"Used VLC player and the subs work fine. They do run out of sync slightly but it's barely noticeable unless your looking for it. +1

PS. I'm more confused after watching it then before I watched it."
