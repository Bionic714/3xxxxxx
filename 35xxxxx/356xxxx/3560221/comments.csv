,felch,2008-04-04T01:31Z,"Zhou.fei.fei -< if the Japanese had stayed in China, would China ""have always been a part of Japan"", and would you say ""fuck the Chinese, they don't deserve independence?"".

You hypocrite.  You like to moan about what they did to your country, but your country tortures and suppresses many people every day.  Change is inevitable, it will hopefully be nonviolent, but if that doesn't work, expect to see an uprising"
,zhou.fei.fei,2008-07-09T11:59Z,"felch is a fucking moron; this dimwit obviously has never learned any history. No one with a functioning brain would compare Japanese invasion of China, Korea, etc, to Chinese annexation of Tibet. Whoever believes otherwise really needs to learn history properly. Who's the real hypocrite?"
,zhou.fei.fei,2008-07-09T12:03Z,"To Felch: -> ""torture and suppress people everyday"". Nobody fucking said the Chinese government was perfect, but making shit up (e.g.: Falun Gong organ harvesting conspiracy, etc) and actually BUYING this shit up is real stupidity; I find it hilarious that Westerners believe they are NEVER brainwashed by ANYONE, because they live in ""democratic"" nations. So, am I suppose to believe EVERYTHING EVERYBODY tells me? Come on, get some senses and DO SOME RESEARCH. All the BS Mr. ""Felch"" is spreading is simply recycled anti-Chinese (or more specifically, anti-Chinese gov't) propaganda. It's laughable to hear and read such obviously dog crap."
,zhou.fei.fei,2008-07-09T12:05Z,"and btw Felch, go on wikipedia and look up ""Japanese War Crime"", see if you can find a connection btwn that and the currently Chinese gov't. I don't suppose Chinese people sliced off women's breasts and raped their corpses during the Cultural Revolution - oh wait, that's what the Japanese soldiers did. Don't believe me? Google Nanjing/Nanking Massacre, or what the Japanese like to call, euphemistically, the Nanking ""Incident"""
