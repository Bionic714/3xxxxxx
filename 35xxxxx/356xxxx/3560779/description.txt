Ever changing bird songs as you walk down a small creek in Briones Park, part of the East Bay Regional Park District near Berkeley CA USA.  47 min.  Very relaxing.

If you like this, you will probably also like the Video of Bird Songs on Bear Creek (or Briones Park) which is also listed on Pirate Bay.  It shows you the birds and creeks you are hearing in Bird Songs on Bear Creek, along with the butterflies, squirrels, coyotes, rabbits, ducks and the other animals that live in the park.
