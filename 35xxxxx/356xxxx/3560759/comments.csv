Downloaded the Keygen only, proceeded to use it for the following Keys:

First Decade

Generals
Renegade
Red Alert 2
Tiberian Sun
Yuri's Revenge

Zero Hour

The generals one gave me an error once, but I might have simply typed it wrong.

And now, it's installing. So, glad to say it, thanks for putting it out "

,wonsleved,2007-10-13T06:23Z,"tried yuri's revenge crack, didnt work,, could have something to do with the updates, i dont know, wouldnt recomend it"
,MarcFirewing,2008-02-08T19:24Z,"I downloaded EVERYTHING in this torrent and scanned it with the latest McAfee Security Center, updates to the virus scan, everything. And let me make this clear.

THERE ARE NO VIRUSES

This is a very clean torrent, I have yet to use it because I'm still downloading Command and Conquer The First Decade =]"
,bvfrd1,2008-06-29T14:45Z,"This Gen works to allow connection through Hamachi for interal playing also to end all rumors this file has been loaded into virustotal.com for scanning and came back clean scanned through 33 anti softwares

,Sayril,2008-08-16T19:10Z,It is a virus. I dont care waht u say.
,mammacalo,2008-08-24T22:23Z,"There's no virus...
Norton etc says virus because they are anti-piracy sides and wanna scare people from using files like this.


Thanks for the download

,o8ao,2009-03-21T16:25Z,"if there is virus, i will make sure all your uploaded torrents will be truncated"
,o8ao,2009-03-21T19:16Z,"this dumb guy doesn't know wat does a crack truly is, his so called 'crack' is like cut and upload from his own yuri revenge game directory. as u noe the yuri load up icon has different size for different downloads. As i have tried to my own yuri revenge. it crashes. and i scanned whole downloaded files using lastest version of norton antivirus and i found trojan horse present in the file. plz do not download this. harm your computers. not only it slows down your comp but also corrupts part of your comp's important files needed to run the system without your awareness. To play yr at a more convenient lvl, plz go download red alert 2+ yuri revenge uploaded by HENZ or hany103, the game inside have a crack itself. with just 1 click, u can enjoy. unlike this..... for other cracks for generals example plz download it from other specified uplaoders, this 1 got virus"
,o8ao,2009-03-21T19:18Z,plus it may crash some of you guys' games
