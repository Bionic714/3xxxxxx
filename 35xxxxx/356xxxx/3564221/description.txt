Cameron Poe, a highly decorated US ranger, is convicted of
manslaughter after protecting his wife in a drunken brawl.
Finally, after eight years, he's being paroled and going home
to his wife and daughter. His ride home: the Jailbird, which
is also transporting society's vicious murderers to Feltham
Penitentiary, Lousiana's toughest maximum security prison. A
surprising escape is made on board the plane as the cons seize
control of the plane, and head it towards Las Vegas. The
officials on the ground want to blow it out of the sky, but
three people know an alternative... US Marshal Vince Larkin,
Cameron Poe's wife, and his daughter.

No extras on the source DVD, and since it was a DVD5 i decided
to leave everything untouched. Somehow the audiotrack on the
sample is german, don't let it frighten you.
