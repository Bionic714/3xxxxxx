this or http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3568697"
,jahijdaar,2006-12-02T20:51Z,"the overal birate on the other one is better so that means better quality as well.
That one has spanish audio (lame) this one has all extras included (also lame).

Movies around 90 mins should mostly be untouched. This one is only 105, so 3.405 Kbps is much to low, could be over 4.000 easily."

,ansimega,2006-12-12T07:38Z,"this movie sucks balls!!! I am not going to download it, i watched it at the movie theater, it was so boring a chick I took their fell asleep. You will only get pissed off from wasting 4.42 GIB on your hard drive. Parts of this movie had potential but it just sucked. This movie is for little kids like  6 - 12 notice cutoff age is 12."
,Branstrom,2006-12-14T11:06Z,"I think I'll like the movie.

But I won't seed another RAR-release again. I hope more people will do the same so that we'll see some change one day."
