My Thoughts: a Japanese science teacher is somewhat traumatised after the event of a gunman hijacking the bus on the school field trip. He decides to steal plutonium from a nuclear power plant and builds one. He makes somewhat bizarre demands such as baseball match live coverage should be broadcasted till the game finishes, not until routine deadline comes and goes off broadcast. If his demands are not met, the bomb goes off?!
First of all, what a suprisingly fun movie! Totally impressed me! A cat-and-mouse play between the teacher and the police detective and time is slowly running out for both of them. Entertaining movie added with tongue-in-cheek humour and the cheesy car-chase scene. Despite being rather unreasonable long but a well worth seeing!
