,jen_eric999,2006-11-22T13:08Z,Is this from the record or the CD? On the CD they substituted at least one different version in place of one of the original tracks.
,mqduck,2006-11-25T02:18Z,"This is a CD version. Although there are a million different versions of every song they released, I'm pretty sure that these are the same versions as on the LP. If you buy the Deluxe version of the CD, it comes with a *second* disk that contains alternate versions. This torrent does not contain the extra tracks in the Deluxe version."
,Tuxie,2006-12-05T18:50Z,Thank you for this! The world can't get enough lossless quality music!
,bauxiet,2009-02-22T12:50Z,And thanks again!

,pedromigel,2012-04-19T18:23Z,"hey, how do we convert into something we can actually hear on ipod and itunes? (in itunes it just passes the beginnings of every song in flac format)"
,pedromigel,2012-04-21T15:27Z,"lol, your description of the torrent is really funny and true ;)"
