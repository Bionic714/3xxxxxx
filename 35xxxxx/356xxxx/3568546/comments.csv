,noggenoshow,2006-12-01T14:40Z,"would i need to re-install the game using the mds file, or is it just a matter of mounting it in daemon to tell the game that the cd is inserted?"
,toxic27,2006-12-01T14:56Z,no need to reinstall.... just mount:) thats what i did:) sorry for late respond;) playing fm now:) 
,tromso27,2006-12-01T17:46Z,"IT CANT WORK,IT SAYS PUT INN RIGHT CD ROM??? WHATS WRONG,HAVE MOUNTED IN DEAMON THE MDF FILE. IT ALSO SAY VERION 7.00,NOT THE NEWEST ONE"
,tromso27,2006-12-01T17:46Z,PLEASE HELP
,noggenoshow,2006-12-01T17:48Z,still doesn't work...think we'll need to wait for a proper patch unfortunately.
,MeRs0,2006-12-01T17:50Z,"I  got the game, but patch aint working without no cd crack v7.01

,kebna,2006-12-01T18:03Z,It works if u put it's shortcut to Windows NT mode.
,toxic27,2006-12-01T18:05Z,you may try using sdhide but i cant see how u cant use this... i downloaded last night and was trilled when i could play with patch... The TLF cloned-cd release always works....

,jukka_jo,2006-12-03T08:10Z,do i have to open all the files or just the first one? (after i´ve unpacked the first big one)
,dacke_77,2006-12-03T13:12Z,"For me it worked fine after extracting. I mounted the mds file in daemon tool. Then I changed the compability mode on the shortcut so footballmanager on the desktop to windows NT.
Thanks Toxic27, I have been looking for a nocd since the patch arrived.
And yes it works fine after the game has been patched to 7.0.1"
,toxic27,2006-12-03T15:06Z,"jukka_jo : u unpack the first big:choose ""extract files..."" , then a new folder witk rar will come.. then choose the FIRST .RAR FILE.... then two files will emerge... mount and play without crack:) hope that clears it up:)"

,chelseafc123,2006-12-03T20:42Z,"sorry, if this is real obvious, but, ok, i get dat u hav to extract the .rar file, and a few other .rar files come up and u hav to extract them, and you end up with a mdf and a mds file, so is this like a binary and .cue files, where you use one to install the game and then use one to mount with daemon tools and play?"
,toxic27,2006-12-03T20:48Z,"yes chelsea;) the smallest is the ""cue"";) then just install.. remember the other tips on this release;) glory Man Utd by the way;) LOL"
,PaddMc,2006-12-03T21:32Z,"Marching on together!!

,chelseafc123,2006-12-03T23:13Z,"ok, so i've downloaded and unzipped part 01, but there are 39 parts all filled with mdf files, is there any need for them or can they just be deleted?"
,chelseafc123,2006-12-03T23:16Z,also what is the .sfv file and the -[100%]-[40.files]-[ServUPlus.fm2007]-[????@TLF-BTTEAM]- file about? should i delete or keep
,toxic27,2006-12-04T00:06Z,LOL are some funny dude:P extract part one of all the 39;) the 2 files that are the game will emerge;)  the mount the mds file in daemon.. what u do with yhe other files after .mds and .mdf files are i use u can choose.. they will only take up place on ur harddrive... the two files u asked about are info files for the .rar-files... get the two mds mdf files and delete the others if u want.. but seed the original big if u will.... happy??? 
,toxic27,2006-12-04T00:08Z,sorry if that was to complicated:P even i had trouble understanding what i wrote:P im playing at the moment...

Then try mounting it butdidnt work. Then tried setting compatibiity to NT but made no difference. Now Im about to give up...:( Would be ever grateful for some (further) advice, have read the comments here over and over..."
,toxic27,2006-12-04T21:19Z,u have monted in the newest daemon?? set emulation on daemon to safedisk??? that should be all you need to do.. but the emulation part is important.. if u exit daemon before playing : remeber to answere yes on question on keping emulation... try that.. set windows to normal again and take it slow bit by bit... i will try to check in at halftime in the prem league match.. 
,tvablaaogon,2006-12-04T22:10Z,Nope still no success:( And nwo bedtime... Will try again tomorrow (maybe a restart will do it...). Thanks for trying to help a FM-thirsting Swede...
,Macca-11,2006-12-04T22:47Z,Cant get this to work jus says insert the cd-rom when you double click the shortcut.

,hamhamwich,2006-12-13T01:21Z,"This is how I got it to work:
1: Extract files (right click and extract here)
2: Download damon tools. Find it here 
http://www.daemon-tools.cc/dtcc/download.php?mode=ViewCategory&catid=5
   Start Damon Tools. Right click damon tools icon in your taskbar(bottom right corner) then Emulation then all opions on.
3: Mount mds-file in daemon tools and install game.(do no play yet)
4: Download and install patch. Find it here:
http://www.fm-base.co.uk/fm2007/index.php?act=view&id=59
5: Download and extract SafeDisc 4 Hider v1.1 . Find it here:
http://www.cdmediaworld.com/hardware/cdrom/cd_utils_8.shtml#SafeDisc%204%20Hider%20/%20SD4Hide
6: When you extract SafeDisc 4 you will have a skull icon. Double click this icon and press hide. Play Football Manager 2007.    
   Once FM2007 is loaded you can press restore on SafeDisc 4 and close it.
   Enjoy."

,hernol,2007-02-19T20:07Z,"Man, that's just for mounting. You need either the original cd or a 'real' image to install it. And never replace the fm.exe with a nocd crack, with daemon and savedisc hider you won't need the crack, actually the crack generates the double prices bug."
