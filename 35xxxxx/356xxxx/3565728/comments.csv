,carcass2,2006-11-27T12:12Z,"revisionists also sais that there was no Holocaust, no moonlanding ond more wierd quasi-science crap. WARNING! Vaccination is a must if we are to eradecate many horrible desieses."
,jhalfmoon,2006-11-27T19:14Z,"Now, now. There's no need to get all worked up. This documentry is what we call ""information"". If you do not like it or do not want it, then don't spend any time on it. If you want to know wat might be possible and what might not be, then use the information. There is no reason to be nasty about it. You are free to decide for yourself what is true and what is worthy of your time."
,01100010,2006-12-01T00:11Z,"As jhalfmoon so patronizingly said, ""if you do not like it or do not want it, then don't spend any time on it."" That is a good idea considering the psuedoscience this mockumentary attempts to convey has been conclusively debunked numerous times."
,01100010,2006-12-01T00:32Z,"And I guess I should add, if you live in the developed world (and you probably do, else you wouldn't be downloading conspiracy videos with your expensive computer) you have little or no chance of contracting rabies, polio, or smallpox even if you aren't vaccinated. The reason for that is that most everyone else has been vaccinated: you're riding on the collective health of the herd, essentially. However, if you live in a developing country where such diseases were/are prevalent, you're taking a serious risk with your life (or, worse, your children's lives): overall health conditions are worse, there are more vectors for the disease, and if you get it you'll infect more people because it's likely that fewer have been vaccinated. Ultimately, believing that vaccines are more harmful than helpful probably won't matter to your individual life, but there are places where it will, and if you propagate this kind of misinformation you're basically an asshole. "
,golibrary!,2006-12-05T11:17Z,"I haven't seen this film yet, but I read the comments and to add:  Many of the diseases against which we vaccinnate are rarely(there are exceptions) able to affect large scale populations.  The major advancements in health in the western world are largely a result of advancements in our standard of living (access to nutrition, access to education, clean water supply, functional sewer systems etc.).  For more information: ""The Role of Medicine"" By Thomas Mckeown."

,Zkalman01,2007-10-03T22:05Z,Homeopath video. Sorry but I don't think that you are right about this. I believe in medical science that has been tested and proven to work. If you don't like the side effects so be it.
,dalpong,2008-01-03T09:40Z,"My rant: I saw this doc years ago and, sure, it could have been done better, but come on, they have no budget at all and it's very difficult to find anyone to come forward to talk about such things as they risk their jobs... the powers that be will strike them down... we're talking about a HUGE moneymaking industry here... the pharmaceutical companies run entire countries with their money now.

You people who believe that vaccinations work are TOTALLY IGNORANT.  I have studied the subject, and vaccinations do not work.  They never have and never will.  You people make me laugh at how pathetic you are when their propaganda spills out of your mouth as if you were actually working for a company that produces these things.  Perhaps you should go and do something called, ""educating yourself"" instead of blindly believing everything you are told.  Bechamp proved vaccinations wrong over 100 fucking years ago and you morons are waaaaay behind in your education. Bechamp? Bechamp who?? Have you heard of Tesla, or Rife?  If you stand in the way of profits... they will tear you down... Discredit you.  Ruin you.  You might even have a little accident or die suddenly.  

I thought that perhaps there were smart or at least open-minded people on this site, but I guess it's mostly young ignorant people looking for porn, movies, and music -- they don't read books anymore... all those facts... baaah, just like UFOs man... Mr 01100010 -- you are frothing at the mouth with shit -- shit that you've been force-fed and are now puking it back up. Fuck... why waste my breath...  If I am prevented from beating them with my fists, then I'll beat them with my words."
,unrar,2008-01-06T23:04Z,Why is there mercury in our vaccines? Mercury is not good for you. It can actually cause small amounts of brain damage. Mothers can carry this on to their children. Why do you think we are having so many health problems in the 20th century? I think we are being manipulated. i don't trust any of it.
,unrar,2008-01-07T01:09Z,"http://www.newstarget.com/011764.html

good info on this one. the preservative used in vaccines since the 30's in the us contained 49.6% mercury by weight. almost all multi dose vaccines. Some vaccines, such as vaccines for hepatitis B, contained as much as 12.5 micrograms of mercury per dose. That's more than 100 times the EPA's upper limit standard when administered to infants. there are now versions of almost all vaccines that are mercury free, but for the unfortunate majority of us it's too late. i received all my immunizations years ago. who knows how many health problems it may cause me down the road. it could just dumb down the american public enough to make them a little easier to control (?). i smell something rotten..."
,kenshinrk,2008-07-19T23:45Z,"i havent watched the movie yet.. but theoretically, vaccines should work, that's what they'r made 4.. well at least, hmmm, unless ur body cant produce the antibody that it is supposed to after vaccination.. 
m not working for a drug company n i dont intend to, but we cant jst criminally accuse someone; on the civil aspect maybe, but not the penal one.. they call it proof beyond reasonable doubt.. i wish somebody here could post an untainted, pharmaceutically-free, legitimate research study regarding vaccination.. 
most of the time, we dont really validate what the nurses/doctors or any of those stupid freaks inject to infants, children, & adults alike.. yeah, most of the time, that's wat we do.. u'r not gonna go to the lab to confirm that it's not shit that they're supposed to inject to u, i mean, nobody wud do dat!?! well unless if u'r a stupid fuckin weirdo."
,kenshinrk,2008-07-19T23:56Z,"nwayz, thnx to heartbug for the apps i've D/Led today.. i've done D/Ling 5 of ur torrents.. i wasnt aware that they all came frm u man.. hw i wish i could crack a software.."
,sonicalchemy,2008-09-13T11:24Z,"Thanx This is a great piece of information, I will do my part and seed this on for a long time. With knowledge we will bring down the N.W.O."
,IAMALLIAM,2009-03-12T13:29Z,"It's amazing how blindly some people follow along with what they are told and then attempt to convince others that they know what they are talking about. VACCINATIONS DO NOT WORK !!!

I thought about providing the information here, but those of you who know, or those that are willing to listen, do not require it, and those that are regurgitating the information that they have been indoctrinated with will not be interested, even though they do require it.

,}{,2009-12-15T02:37Z,"This documentary is not ""information"". It is dis-information. It's not bad to watch it, but you have to educate yourself fully from all perspectives. It may not be fun, but you must study, study, study. Become an expert on BOTH sides, then make up your mind based solely on the data set.

If you watch a video like this one, try to find rebuttal for the ideas presented.

One side of the vaccine debate is very, very wrong. Keep an open mind, be willing to be change your stance, and keep researching. It's not very hard to work out which side has the data on its side.

,JulianBashir,2010-09-17T22:16Z,"This is pure tripe. For example:
 - Only one side of the argument is presented. 
 - A (registered) dog breeder is called on as an expert on human diseases.
 - The video makes several claims without identifying sources.
 - Where sources are indicated, they are vague - only giving journal and year, not issue, volume and page.
 - There are ambiguous claims, e.g. ""8 to 10 children in Australia die from cot death"" - is that per thousand, per year, or since some date in the past?
 - One of the interviewees appear to think that Polio is a man-made disease, and that a well known bacterial disease is not transmitted by bacteria.

...

I could go on, but I think you get my point: This is drivel produced by over-active imaginations, based on the flimsiest of evidence.

Only watch this if you want to have a good laugh at the expense of those less intelligent than you."

,mokabear,2011-05-26T13:22Z,"@daplong, while I agree that the pharm companies have a huge market today, it doesn't mean that the products they make are all crap and useless (although some might suffer from placebo effect).  With regards to your comment about Bechamp, perhaps we don't all know who he is but perhaps it's because he fell into the shadows of Pasteur, who I believe many more people would know.

Pierre Jacques Antoine BĂ&#x192;ÂŠchamp was a French biologist. He studied silkworm parasites, and was the first to synthesise Atoxyl.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antoine_B%C3%A9champ

His theory was discarded by science in favor of Pasteur's repeatable demonstrations.  

This doesn't mean he was an idiot, but theories are just that until proven through repeatability.  It is the scientific way...  I'm not going to bother with this d/l and waste my time and bandwidth."
