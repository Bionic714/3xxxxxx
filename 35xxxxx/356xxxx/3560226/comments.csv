,sartec,2006-11-19T00:09Z,When you download it is a torrent that have the original torrent.
,therealduckie,2006-11-19T07:40Z,"Why would you make a torrent of torrents?

Why not offer the files?"
,sartec,2006-11-19T10:11Z,because i have to shutdown my computer for 5 hours.
,NeXTSTEP,2006-11-19T11:46Z,"The torrent was uploaded at the Demonoid tracker. But since Leopard betas are forbidden there, everyone knew that the torrent was to be deleted. But, by removing a torrent from the tracker does not necessary mean that the torrent is dead. Clients can still connect to each other and share whatever the torrent was all about. That's exactly what has happen. About an hour ago, the Leopard torrent was removed from the Demonoid tracker and is now carried only by those who is using it. It can still be downloaded. But since you need the torrent file that was originally hosted at Demonoid, someone put the torrent file in a torrent and posted here. "
,antamony,2006-11-19T19:07Z,"Many thanks to ""sartec"" for get this torrent from Demonoid to PB!

While it was disappointing to watch the leechers with huge bandwidth hit & run, thanks to you & others, we early ones finally now have it.

Amazing to watch the seeder count go up!


Thanks again! And see you at that crazy mac place!"

help!"
,antamony,2006-11-24T16:41Z,"""Seems like the torrent is dead. ""

Just checked, 50 seeds, 97 leechers.

You NEED to use a client that supports DHT trackers."
,ziddy,2006-11-24T21:06Z,Ok. It works fine now. Thanks!
,since666333,2006-11-24T21:58Z,"yes, great. thk all"
,markiv34,2006-11-24T23:52Z,"Use Azureus for dht if on windows, else bitcomet and bitlord are pretty good too (Windows based)"
,G4MER,2006-11-25T01:10Z,"I'm using Azureus and it still says torrent ""deleted or not in pool yet"" though it looks like i do receive. Would that affect the final file? Thanks in advance_"
,antamony,2006-11-25T04:44Z,"""I'm using Azureus and it still says torrent ""deleted or not in pool yet""""

That's the demonoid tracker.

right click on the torrent while it's loaded and slect ""show details"". 

Bottom line is, if you are downloading bytes, then the DHT is working."
,G4MER,2006-11-25T10:20Z,Thanks antamony_
,matacochinos,2006-11-25T16:09Z,"hmmm, i get a checksum error, my dvd burn wont boot.  i tried the partitioning method also wont boot from the partition.

,jackmaninov,2006-11-28T09:55Z,"If you're having trouble installing this, try removing the Italian language files and the Cannon printer drivers; these didn't work when installing from my copy (restored to an iPod)."
,ziddy,2006-11-30T02:57Z,"I also have a problem. I have created 3 partitions of my internal drive (using the GUID Partition Table).

1. 52 GB - Current System (10.4.8)
2. 6 GB - Installation restored from the downloaded image
3. 16 GB - Prepared for Leopard

I start up from the second partition to install Leopard. Everything goes well until I'm about to select the disk I want to install on. The third partition is then disabled saying ""that Mac OS X cannot be installed on this volume, because it's not able to start from it"". What does this mean? I've tried to format it as both Extended and Extended (Journaled). I have a Intel Mac mini with 1.66 GHz Core Duo by the way. I would really appreciate any help.
Thanks."
,karlhungus_,2006-12-06T02:10Z,"Hi, 
i downloaded and works fine for me, if anyone wants to try you should be able to start the leo download automatically by entering the following url in to azureus:

Open Torrent File>Add Url, then paste in :

magnet:?xt=urn:btih:QHVIWADUSTZONMGE3U6HLDNTAKOY4O24

cheers"
,biatx,2006-12-07T12:11Z,"Can someone who successfully downloaded and installed leopard post a MD5 sum of the .dmg file ? Mine says it's corrupt, and has a md5 of c748aed8a77e4610e87442e074241953 . I need to fix it, but i don't know how."
,karlhungus_,2006-12-08T17:33Z,"Hi, 
the md5 of my .dmg is also:
c748aed8a77e4610e87442e074241953 

and it installed fine, just skip the check when mounting the dmg and it should be ok."
,MagusPSU,2006-12-09T23:14Z,"Here's how I managed to install it:

For starters you need to skip the verification to avoid the checksum error.  Make your DVD or restore to a hard drive and reboot to the disc/drive.

Do an Archive and Install.  When prompted, do a custom installation and uncheck the printer drivers as well as the languages (I kept getting an error when it tried to install Italian).

Continue as normal."
