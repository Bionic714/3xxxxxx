FROM OTHER TORRENT WESITE:
So here you go, as I promised: fresh from seeding to 1 on oink 

(man, that is hard to do, all the torrents there are so very well-seeded!) 

It\\\\\\\'s a pretty OK build, seems stable. Nothing much of note, but no ZOMG TOP-SECRET FEATURES that the rumour-mills are inferring from comments in Job\\\\\\\'s WWDC keynote. 

What I\\\\\\\'m trying to say is: it\\\\\\\'s not as compelling as Tiger or Panther were. With those versions I found myself running the dev builds as my main OS as soon as they were reasonably stable, because the new features were so awesome. Nothing on that level is really in Leopard, for me anyway. 

Instructions for installing are in the seed note file. The burn-to-disc method didn\\\\\\\'t work for me, but my burner is an after-market upgrade, so whatever. The three-partitions method works great though (use iPartition to do this non-destructively). 

Have fun, seed 1:1 and hey, don\\\\\\\'t bug me for an oink account. I\\\\\\\'ve only had mine 3 days and you need to have upped 10GB with a 1.05 ratio to get invites (or, indeed, use the site\\\\\\\'s cooler features, see why everything is so well-seeded?). 

[edit] Azureus has decided it wants to \\\\\\\"super-seed\\\\\\\" this, which I gather means Demonoid doesn\\\\\\\'t see me as a seeder? I\\\\\\\'m there guys, honest.
