The CD contains 2000 hand-picked articles of particular interest to schools or children (Geography, Science, Dinosaurs, Plants and Animals). The articles were hand selected off the 

English Wikipedia by volunteers working for SOS Children, checked for suitability to children and cleaned by hand and script. The CD includes only thumbnails of images. 

Wikipedia user Wikiwizzy converted the wikipedia portion to Plucker database to carry on SD card for Palm Pilot. Pictures were downsized to 150x150, 8 bit color.

The detailed process for original CD production was:

About 2500 articles were chosen from good articles, featured articles and major lists (e.g. all countries, all capital cities, etc.)

Rubbish, schoolchild tump, disambiguation pages and shallow pages were discarded and redirects sorted.

Previous consensus versions were taken where articles had disputed flags (e.g. Christianity etc)

Links to articles not included and external links were rendered as texts.

Empty, link-list and silly sections were removed (using volunteers to list them).

Editorial notices and notes, links to other languages etc were removed.

The WP logo was removed as SOS did not have permission to use it. Permission has since been granted and the 2007 Selection will have the Wikipedia logo on it.

The only added content into the WP pages is small box notices on about 130 pages which have a particular relevance to SOS Children (e.g. many of the 125 countries where SOS 

works, see for example Africa). These comply with best practice of not interfering with editorial content of articles.

The resulting version fits on a CD together with the SOS Children website which is offered for free download or free CD for collection only.

Automated spelling correction was run.
