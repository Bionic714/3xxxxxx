,Consider-Phlebas,2006-11-19T13:16Z,"VLC reports that the avi file is broken and proposes to repair to facilitate correct searching, which works (it only repairs in runtime though, it seems, because it remains that way) and then it plays fine.
Windows Media Player plays without problems.
Thanks!"
,Consider-Phlebas,2006-11-19T13:43Z,Uups - spoke hastily. Only the first 5 minutes play in VLC. Index is broken.
,J_Decibel,2006-11-19T18:58Z,If I play it with WMP there is no picture. Am I doing something wrong or is it really broken?
,Consider-Phlebas,2006-11-19T19:50Z,I get good play with Windows Media Player. Perhaps you lack a codec of some kind...
,J_Decibel,2006-11-19T20:50Z,"Oke, do you have any suggestions? Normally I don't play anything with WMP 'cause everything works fine with VLC."
,Consider-Phlebas,2006-11-19T22:52Z,"No - sorry. I also usually use VLC for about everything, so I've not followed the codec market lately. Try looking for XVID/DIVX stuff on the net, perhaps you find a codec package. Take care not to mess up what you have working, though...

Or, download again to make sure you did not get a corrupt file."
,Consider-Phlebas,2006-11-19T22:55Z,"B.t.w., thefolenangel said this on another site:

""Don't know for you but i'm watching it fine with BSPLAYER ... ;)""

Perhaps that can help you - I do not know anything about that SW."
,J_Decibel,2006-11-19T22:58Z,Oke i'll do that. Thanks for the info!
,J_Decibel,2006-11-21T23:45Z,"The DivX tip works fine Consider-Phlebas, thanks!"
,Consider-Phlebas,2006-11-22T22:10Z,You're welcome :-)
,Consider-Phlebas,2006-12-21T21:54Z,Update - this plays fine with the recently released version 0.8.6 of VLC!
