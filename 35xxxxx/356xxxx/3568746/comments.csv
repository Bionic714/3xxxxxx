That's the reason why I'm late today and that's why I won't be making small pack for FW. Plus, I was not able to download/share anything while I was doing that. :D 

For me, 1 episode at a time is the solution. ;)"
,i2mfan,2006-12-01T23:04Z,"It gave me chance to see how it would reacted with my slow upload speed(30k/s) if I wanted to seed a small pack of 5 episodes. I had my answer :D. 

It could serve to others that wanted to do it and had a speed like mine.

P.S. no one complained but some did asked. I did it out of curiosity. ;)"
