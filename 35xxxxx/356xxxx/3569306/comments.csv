At the same time the Lutherans in Germany burned 25,000 people. So it seems Protestant hysteria isn't just an American phenomenon, it's an integral part of the crazy fucking cult. Fuck King Billy up the shitter."
,ildefonso,2008-06-28T03:24Z,"Who the hell are you, nilbud, and from what part of the Roman Catholic Christian Church do you come from, my dear friend ?
400 years of inquisition and only 109 people burned ?!?!?!?!?
Where did you get these ***cough*** ""facts"" from ?
Everybody knows that even without and exact counting, peopled burned and other way eliminated by the Roman Christian Church allover the world during the ""golden times of Christianity"" should be in the order of millions !

Even if you are right about the critic to this documentary (and most people today already posses enough critic spirit to always give a rebate to this ""conspiracy materials"")...the fact is that if they say 120.000 burned...yeah, they're wrong, but only UNDERESTIMATING !

Finally, note: I don't have any ""zealotism"" against you just because you (obviously) are a devoted Christian...


But such a grotesque affirmation (109 burns in 400 years) and not even a (far more conspirative than this content ) source for this ridiculous claim...you were just asking for it, my dear friend !

,FigaroUno,2008-08-16T13:28Z,"109 only? well I am a Roman Catholic and this seem to be a bit underestimated.  They did not burn enough witches.  I could think of a few relatives of mine that they missed. 

No shit aside, is n't it suppose to be based on released documents from the Catholic faith.  Seem like Pope John Paul spent a lot of time appologising during his time in the sea."
,noneofurbusiness,2008-10-01T09:56Z,"well, 109 burnings is quite right - if you count only those killed in my hometown ...
btw, is it better to kill ""only"" 109 in the name of an all-loving and forgiving god?? hmm... which one is the better evil?"
,mtfury,2008-12-05T00:35Z,"Another historical documentary which of couse the Vatican would have it's Jesuit footsoldiers destroy, torturing anyone who got in their way.

Roman Catholics hate the truth. LONG LIVE THE PROTESTANT REFORMATION!"
,Lifemage,2008-12-10T12:49Z,"What part of the north are you from nilbud lol All jokes aside, being a Catholic myself, even I know it was more than 109, but at the same time, tis true that there's just as many other religions did just as much, if not more 'burnings' sacrifices of humanity"
,yuq,2009-03-30T16:52Z,any subs available ?
,sillyscrewy,2010-04-08T15:35Z,Thanks for this documentary. All religions are ultimately about power and wealth. The greatest atrocities heaped upon mankind are always done in the name of god(s).
