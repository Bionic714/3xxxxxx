,Hellraiser5,2006-11-23T20:40Z,"Very good, no rar files very very good!!!!!

I personaly think its the most stupid way to make a torrent. first you have VOB files then they put them in an iso file and then the masterminds put them in 100 or more freakin rar files!!!!! Whats the freakin use of that?
Just to keep everybody busy i suppose??
THANX FOR THE TORRENT!!"
