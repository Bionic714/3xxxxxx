So you mean it's a fake then? not the new one?

Hmm, seems like everyone else havn't said anything about it's wrong. Think you are the wrong one."
,Milos_duke,2006-12-06T20:22Z,Is this BAND CAMP? 
,Winston Smith,2006-12-06T22:37Z,"fuck me!! 99,7% done and failed - permission denied.. What is that?"
,Sikker,2006-12-07T06:30Z,"Hey dudes, i'm sorry about that band camp thing. I downloaded this one and it wasn't Band camp. My bad, but anyway nice upload and the quality is very nice. You know if 10 is a normal dvd then this is 9½. The movie was okay but allmost the same as American Pie 1.
                         Thanks masseur."

,figge_85,2007-01-02T14:03Z,hur gör man för att se filmen efter download??
,kaken1992,2007-01-04T20:50Z,"Agree with lessah .
This movie is not as good as the other.
This movie sucks.
I wish they had the same Stifler in all movies.
The first stifler was cool, and when the new one came, it started to be worse after each movie.
much more reasons!


But there were some tities in the movie:P"
,kaken1992,2007-01-04T20:51Z,And I also rather watch teletubbies.
