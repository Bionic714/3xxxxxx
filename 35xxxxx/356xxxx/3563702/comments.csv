,SpoinkK,2006-11-27T01:38Z,Are these just the songs? Or is this actually the real game for PC? because it doesn't sound like it... =\
,tovus,2006-11-29T23:33Z,These are simfiles using the music on the list. To play these you need a DDR emulator called Stepmania - www.stepmania.com - then you load the songs up and it plays exactly like in the arcade/home versions!
