,phishead,2006-11-29T19:48Z,Can anybody that has downloaded this confirm that is working on the ps3. Its not on any other sites right now. It would suck if this bricked your ps3. 
,ToN10,2006-11-29T23:14Z,Doesn't this need a KBOOT file to load?

,spawnette,2006-12-02T07:11Z,Is this for real? Is there a Trojan?
,spawnette,2006-12-03T14:24Z,Thanks iroc261. I installed and seems to work good
,silentstrike213,2006-12-17T03:47Z,i keep getting an erro NO VRS Found waht is this and what can i do to fix it?
,johncoom,2006-12-30T04:32Z,TAKE NOTE: This Torrent has the 2006-11-27 iso and this was removed from the YDL mirror sites. Now there is a 2006-12-08 iso version that has been issued to replace this one. So there are very likely to be 'some or many' bugs with this iso ? USE AT YOUR OWN RISK and to confirm what I am telling you about OLD + NEW iso's go to one of the mirror Links listed above and check out in the ISO folder and MD5SUMS file - NOTICE also the 2006-11-27 iso is not there any more - you may wonder why ? Bugs may be ? so you might require the NEW iso = yellowdog-5.0-phoenix-20061208-PS3.iso

,zeroexcelcior,2007-12-14T05:02Z,"save yourself some time and get ydl here

,sciencectn,2008-01-15T22:56Z,"This is almost worthless. Unless you get the CELL BE SDK from IBM and write programs to use the cores efficiently, it only uses the two ppc cores on the cell while the other 8 SPEs sit there and do nothing. There's no driver for the RSX either. Your PS3 essentially becomes a computer with no graphics card and only a dual core ppc processor when running this. Sony doesn't want much access to the PS3's hardware from ydl because they're afraid that people will pirate games and run them under ydl."
,samshirley001,2008-02-03T11:57Z,do you need a usb mouse and keyboard for this to be usable???

@ 800KB Sec. 
I'm gonna try it on my PS3.
Thanks for the info guys."
,hoof889,2008-10-21T13:49Z,hakkebakkemakke  you can allways go back to ps3 system by turning of the main power from back and then you have to set your finger to the 0/I button and hold it there... then switch the mainpower back on from the back... it starts to ''beeb'' and after the second or was it the third time it goes off then you have to turn the power back on and youll be back in PS3 os ... Sry my bad english :S
,immortal07,2008-10-24T16:27Z,"Ok. I got everything to work, but after the kboot, i cant see anything, then the scren comes up looking all mest up. Do i have to write a command at kboot?"
,Mestaman,2008-12-04T23:24Z,does anyone know why my ps3 tells me no applicable installer found
,Draecoda,2008-12-23T23:36Z,"Okay, for anyone who wants to put Yellowdog on their PS3 you are probably best to get it directly from the horses mouth....

http://ftp.yellowdoglinux.com/pub/yellowdog/
From there go to ISO... They have a version 5.0 and 5.1 PS3 ISO, as well as version 6 of yellowdog.. "
