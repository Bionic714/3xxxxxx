,bandwagon,2007-12-11T22:58Z,"Hi! Great Film. Very good print. my problem is that after burning the DVD I don't get the subs. WHat do I do?
Please help!"
,elba00,2007-12-18T21:47Z,"I havent dowloaded it yet...many DVD players support srt/txt format subtitles, if your filenames are the same (satantango1.avi & satantango1.srt)then your DVD player should display the sub properly. If you want to hardcode (in case your DVD player doesnt recognize the sub) the sub into the video stream use VirtualDub with TextSub filter then burn the AVI or convert it to DVD with VSO's ConvertXtoDVD(the fastest method). Find more info of subs at:doom9, afterdawn."
,zonker_xs,2008-01-17T01:36Z,thanks! this film is just fantastic
,Mentat_Abbas,2008-03-08T17:14Z,"Thanks for sharing this, but I must ask, couldn't it have been possible to make this so that the whole package would fit on a single DVD-R, as opposed to spilling out by 400 megs?

Thanks again for sharing this, this very mild inconvenience is still better than not having the film at all. :]"
,stelfy,2008-04-10T03:34Z,"This is great! Thanks to beksinski.  
will seed for a long time.."
,zeinabqureshi,2008-07-03T08:39Z,"Never mind that ""400 MB spilling over"" bit. This is a terrific torrent, and the film is hard to find even on the stores. 

Great many thanks, terrific upload, great quality."
,cachegames,2008-07-10T11:20Z,"...this might be the best movie I've *ever* seen! It's an 8-hour orgasm, so beautiful!"
,raheesen,2008-09-06T00:06Z,"Its Completed...Its Completed.............
The biggest torrent I have ever downloaded-2.5 days,7.5 hours and 4.8gb...........
It gives the much needed confidence to download the much bigger files like-Dekalog,War and Peace etc......(my download speed varies-30-60KB/s)...
As always with Beksinski and freakyflicks people-excellent quality...great movie...
Thanks to piratebay,its members and everyone who supported to download this and other great movies.
"
,raheesen,2008-09-06T00:10Z,"And yes...
'If we all seed just 1:1, give at least what we take, this torrent will NEVER DIE'
To me-at least 2:1.
THANKS..."
