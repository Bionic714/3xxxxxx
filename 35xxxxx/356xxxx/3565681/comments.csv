first it was the robusto then crystal what's next Gold! I got them both it's a OK idea,
 but now why don't you just compile one yourself for ""us"" and make  a perfect running Media editing XP sp2,
  with some serious movie and sound editing the likes of Adobe Premiere, Sony Acid, and Photoshop,
 with a nice choice of themes,and WMC, but without chopping WXP to pieces,
 and of course make a totally unattended install.  "
,vanTorX,2006-11-30T08:05Z,"I get those windows 'Windows cannot find *.exe blah blah' dialogs poping up quite a bit for programs that I didn't choose to put into my iso, I dismiss those without waiting and it seems ok

anyway, how do you know when photoshop install has finished? is there some indication?

I find it quite hard to make CD/DVD that is burned ok and install fine, mostly it has glitches but I think that's due to media and or burning prog because I sometimes manage to install perfectly and everything I need in install works which is great
 is Nero ok for making isos? or is Alcohol better? 
would burning at lowest speed help?"
,charlesb1,2006-11-30T22:07Z,"vanTorX
 I always burn ISO images with Nero, it has never let me down I use Nero Ultra 6 CD DVD with the latest updates. It's the older version, I and many others think is the best one. "
,jstevenson72,2006-12-01T03:44Z,"This package has a few flaws...

No matter which of the application packages you choose, the tool will try to install the following, in addition to what you choose:
 - Acrobat 8
 - Daemon Tools
 - GMail Drive
 - Google Earth
 - IE7
 - Office Pro Plus 2007 Beta 2
 - Office Pro 2003
 - Office Pro 2003 reatta32
 - Symantec Antivirus Corporate

If you haven't added those add-ons, you can simply dismiss the ""File Missing"" dialogs, and it continues properly, but it doesn't make you feel comfortable.

I continue to have networking trouble after 10-15 min after the PC boots, my network shares disappear and I loose internet access, but this may be related to my NIC, and not the OS.

But since I received so many errors, its hard to feel confident that the OS is stable.

Also if you choose to Install the IE7 Add-On Package, IE will be broken.  You must uninstall it afterwards to regain IE Functionality.

Hopefully Reatta32 will come up with some simple fixes to this otherwise awesome release.

Thanks,

Jason"
,vanTorX,2006-12-01T08:35Z,"I found the same thing having to dismiss the Missing files, probably for the same selection but that causes no trouble as far as I can see

the other things, the loss of network etc., I believe now that is all due to failed proper installation of windows (badly burned CD or something of the sort) even if the install goes through - I had some oddities during several installs and if you get those, they are tell tell signs of post install troubles and or instabilities - 

thing is that on about third or fourth install of previous Robusto version it installed correctly eventually, I had some parts missing like no hyperthreading and some dlls were reported missing when I did some other installs later on, basically serious ills but they all dissapeared on my 4th install and I expect that this Crystal version will be no differrent, it has only cosmetic differences from Robusto

I run Robusto now for number od days and everything is fine and IMO it is so far the best (nothing is missing you might need) of the various releases like Tiny and previous Jacked versions

also I don't think you can run IE6 while you have IE7 installed, that's Microsoft doing, nothing to do with this release at all, I believe that wouldn't change even if you ponied up cash for your XPs and got IE7 officially"
,vanTorX,2006-12-01T08:53Z,"thx reatta32 for supplying us with releases, it just came to me that you could make torrents with separate Progam Add on packages (in which you might have tweaked some programs or added new ones) and separate basic Raw OS Files... 

reason is those of us who might want just the extra programs in new release might download just those, best if we could download just those programs that would complete our already downloaded collection, or redownload tweaked install package of single program (if you would tweak them to be better behaving)

and if you add new theme like in this Crystal edition, some would want to download just those Raw OS files...

just food for thought"
,vanTorX,2006-12-03T04:16Z,"just installed this edition and all went completely fine ( except you get those missing files for apps you don't install), but IE7 won't even open, some Ordinal 363 cannot be found it says in some dll... that's crap

not crazy about the theme either, gone from my disk"
,Surrez,2006-12-07T11:51Z,CRAP. This is just a win modifier. Not the real thing. Stupid reatta32 bastard.
,kebabcarlos,2006-12-18T00:09Z,"love this work, big upp to reatta32 for the good work"
,kebabcarlos,2006-12-18T00:44Z,SEED ffs
,bbmaster,2007-01-10T03:25Z,I really liked the package and the theme but was stumped when my ATI drivers would not install on this system. I will keep it on my drive as a backup OS and the download was well worth it anyway for the programs and the theme. Thanks reatta32
,Zforce_,2007-01-17T20:14Z,"hmm, is this 64bit version ?"
,hilly7,2007-02-10T05:53Z,Haven't check it all yet but have found nothing bad. Actually impressive. A few Trial programs but worth the download. 
,B-manSwe,2007-02-24T15:23Z,"I have tried with them all, borgedition, robusto, crystal, gold and Windows Xp Black, but in the end everything on an ""original"" windows xp does something, you cant just take away some things like that...in the end you will all at sometime get a ""windows cant find""-messega of some kind and then your fucked, if your going to download xp then take a oem or retail and take a cracked serial..."
,B-manSwe,2007-02-24T15:26Z,"ehh vanTorX , i just went fine but you cant use IE7??? what went fine then if i may ask?"
,dbitc,2007-05-31T22:42Z,what is a  language this system
