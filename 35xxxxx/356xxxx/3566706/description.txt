My own selection of 10 (Happy) Hardcore tracks that I really like that I just wanted to share with the rest of the world. 

Note that some tracks are taken from compatilations and that's also the reason why they might start off and end weird.

Regarding 'Hardcore Paradise', that's not the original structure of the song but I had to take it from a CD where it had been mixed around a bit. And that's also the only version of the song that I have it, unfortunately.
