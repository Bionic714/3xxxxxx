could i have my networkcable in my xbox after that i flached my DVD? or is LIVE Funktion gone after that?  i know that i can´t play LIVE white a backup, but is there any problems after ""Flasching the drive"" with ahutorisation or something? "
,Beavernisse,2006-11-22T13:01Z,"I think you won´t get banned, but that´s only for the moment!"
,dragonfang,2006-11-22T18:22Z,"In fact you CAN use modded 360s and even play backups on Live, but like Beavernisse wrote it could be just a matter of time before Microsoft finds a way to detect and ban boxes with modified DVD firmware... If you are concerned about losing Live functionality and can't afford to buy another 360 if you get banned, DON'T FLASH!"
,jonisz,2006-11-22T23:20Z,"ok i see.. but a question more.. is this the same type of bootdisc as the olddays Playstation ""BOOTDISC"" there you first boot with this disc than you put your backup in the sleve? or is this a tool to flasch my xbox360 DVD permenant? and to ""dragonfang"" i am a poor son of a good.. he he.. ICE KILL THE POOR!!"
,dragonfang,2006-11-23T15:13Z,"jonisz: It's not that simple. Flashing a xbox 360 dvd drive is a LOT more complicated than using a boot disc for a ps2. This is more like installing a modchip. You need to open your 360 and connect cables to your pc. 

And BTW: This disc is something you put in your pc, not the 360. And it only works if you have the hitachi dvd drive (and even then, not for all firmware revisions). But if you want to know how to do this, I suggest you read the newbie guide at 360mods.net. And if you think it looks too complicated, DON'T DO IT YOURSELF! You could seriously mess up your console."
,jonisz,2006-11-24T21:54Z,"thanks alot dragonfang for your answer. i really appreciate your replay. i got a frien who will help me soon ""i hope"" ha ha. thanks again duud"
