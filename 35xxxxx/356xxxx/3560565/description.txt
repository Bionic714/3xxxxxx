info about these software
===================
VLMenuPlus is a drop-in menu enhancer for your applications. With VLMenuPlus you don\'t have to change the way you have used menus till now. Simply drop this control on the main form of your application and run the application. The menus will auto-magically be transformed ... without need of writing even a single line of code. 

---------------
VLButtonBar is an advanced activeX button bar that can be used to incorporate MS Outlook styled navigation sidebar, vertical menu as well as visual basic style tool palette into your applications.

The control provides a variety of orientation and layout combinations for groups and buttons to suite your specific needs. Also, the control can automatically calculate the appropriate size for buttons based on button picture size, button caption and the font, or you can specify a custom button size as per your requirements. 

---------------
Use VLFormDesigner to deliver a full-fledged, feature rich runtime form designer with unbelievably small amount of code. 

---------------
VLPropertyList offers a very elegant and intuitive interface to visualize and manipulate a set of property-value pairs.

Ideally suited to load, display and modify properties of COM objects (IDispatch interface required), you can also use it to display and manipulate any set of properties and values. The properties can be categorized as per your requirements. Multi-level categorization and dual views (flat as well as hierarchical) are supported.

---------------
VLViewPort is a container control that provides scrollable viewport. It lets you specify the viewport extent and allows scrolling of the view whenever your form is smaller than the specified extents.

It also supports automatic calculation of viewport extent based on the position of it\'s contained controls.

Auto-adjust extent mode handles even dynamically added controls (controls that you add to the viewport control at runtime).

----------------
VLFullScreen allows your application to acquire all of the available screen area as and when desired with absolutely minimal coding (how about zero!).

Complete control on the font and text lets you use it for applications developed for non-English languages also, and maintain consistency in the look and feel of your application.
