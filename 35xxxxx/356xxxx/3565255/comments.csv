,Churchills Dog,2006-11-27T01:10Z,"Probably one of the most underrated shooters of the past 5 years. At first it will seem goofy and old school but give it some time. This game will challenge you (especially if you enjoy games like Quake, Doom etc). Don't expect DX9 shaders and ultra detailed character animations. The game is, after all, several years old. The above review is correct though in that these idiotic Russians rushed this out with no online support. The SP campaign is also unfinished in many areas. Still though, This could've been the answer to many old school Quake fanatics dreams.

Give it a shot, just don't drop it after a couple of levels, stay with it. It gets much better as you gain experience points."
,andyman32,2006-11-27T12:17Z,I'm definitely up for it - I'm a fan of 'underrated' FPSs :) Just wish the seeder would reconnect...

,FatGodzilla,2007-03-23T17:49Z,"Please seed! I really want this game, even if it's unpopular it's a pretty rare game to find :(

So help out seeding, it would be great! Thanks."
,FatGodzilla,2007-03-23T18:21Z,"btw, i'm using a GeForce 8800 GTS and you can push the graphics engine of this game to the limits and create some really neat graphics, and like Dog said, it's a great game for anyone who likes the Quake and Doom series, but want to try something special.. Here are some pictures:
