,PLCharlie,2007-01-17T20:05Z,okay. I didn't download this but I've had Vista ultimate for about 15 days.. And I gotta say that nothings really changed.. I mean - yeah some cool animated layouts which make it look more attractive.. but thats about.. unless you're a real lover of it and checked it all out. but my point.. WAIT until its out proberbly.. nottin is designed to vista and I had a lot of problems with different apps and stuff.. but my advice to those who want it to work from scratch is WAIT!!!
,chadzky,2007-06-20T10:15Z,"I have already a Windows Vista Ultimate in my workplace and it's working. I have downloaded a Crack from the internet and it says my Windows Vista is licensed and I can download updates from M$.
I also tried installing the Windows Vista Business Premium it it also works.
Now I am enjoying Windows Vista thanks to the one who uploaded the crack on the internet."
