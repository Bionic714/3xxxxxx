Another classic series from the BBC's "Walking with" series of documentary style education programmes. This has people swimming with the seven deadliest marine predators in the dinosaur era.

The sound isn't 100% but it's OK and the content is very good. If you enjoyed the 'Walking with Dinosaurs' series you will like this.
