Sorry man, I haven't tried on a Wii.  Have yet to get one :(

I did hear there were region issues with Wii, e.g. using a PAL disc won't work on a NTSC Wii.  But I would look that up if I were you.  

As I mentioned though, there is a selector, so if you can somehow get to that, you will be set.  Somehow I think the NTSC Wil will not output pal frequency (perhaps using some kind of filter, 50Hz?), and something like this may be the issue."
