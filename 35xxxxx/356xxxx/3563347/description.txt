The PerPetRatOrS release was wiped to a 1.2 GB. This version is the same as PerPetRatOrS, but the size has been fixed and padding has been re-introduced in to the ISO (Using FSTFIX).  Due to this, the image is ready to place on a DVD. Please notice the size is still 1.2GB due to being in a compressed form.  The old PerPetRatOrS release was redundant as wiping the image and compressing it, provided exactly the same ratio of compression as just doing only compression (which is what I did).  Anyhow, I released this because many do not know what to do when they get a wiped image, and it can be a great hassle without the correct tools.    

	This image has been tested on Ritek G05 fullsize media with Duo Q on a NTSC DOL-001 and works great (This is a USA NTSC console)!  


The game will simply ask you if you would like to use on a 60hz television (NTSC) at the beginning and you just push the A button (it will be outputting a PAL frequency though so it will be flipping when it asks you, but it is still readable).  

Good Classic game, hope you all enjoy.
