Description:
Gold. Silver. Land. Opportunity. But first, you had to get there!

In 1869, one of the greatest building achievements in history the Transcontinental Railroad was completed. But for the stalwart settlers willing to risk it all, the American West was far from conquered. Travel on the thin steel ribbon of the railroad was a dangerous, even deadly, affair. Bandits, renegades and hostile tribes threatened every trip. Millions of acres of territory were virtually unreachable. To exploit these new lands, thousands of miles of new rails would be laid in the late 1800's, opening the west to settlement, commerce, and civilization.

Explore the complete story of the Western railroads through rare photographs, spectacular re-creations and expert interviews. From the early gun battles and political fights to the engineering triumphs that finally mastered a hostile terrain, take an astonishing adventure fueled by ambition and daring!
