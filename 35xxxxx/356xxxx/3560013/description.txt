Hey fellow pirates,

This is a bootlegged version of the new teaser trailer
for the upcoming Harry Potter film.
Note that this version has extremely shitty quality,
as it was recorded using a camera in the cinema.

The torrent contains the original XviD encode with MP3 sound.

My advise you be to wait for the official webwide
release on Monday, 20th of November 3pm (EDT).
For an up-to-the-second countdown please visit this link:

It will be availiable then on every single trailer site
(like trailers.apple.com) on the web. These version will
have a much better quality (maybe even high definition).

But for everyone who can't wait, here it is.

Enjoy.
