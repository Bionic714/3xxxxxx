,hawken1,2006-12-05T07:12Z,"I'm sorry to say this. but the sound quality is not the best. there's a bit of distortion when I compare to the CD.
Sounds like Rimis didn't start out with the CD quality to encode from or something...
double mp3 compression is what it sounds like anyway."
,Rimis,2006-12-05T16:13Z,I didn't rip it by myself. It was downloaded from another torrent site. This is a release of uF team. All your complains are going to them.
