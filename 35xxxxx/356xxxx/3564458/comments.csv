,Rethic,2007-06-16T14:06Z,How can you be so totally brainfucked that you use the Halflife-logo without writing that you've got permission?
,skavank,2007-09-10T17:51Z,"Are you people real? Sure if its not a real Cd, you should write it on the information so you dont confuse others. But he is still sharing something, doing good for others. And Rethic im not gonna write all the mad things I think about you. But Rethic rimes with Pathetic, maybe change nick? So lame of you to talk about permission, its a fucking ascii picture. Did you notice that he was sharing 17 tracks? Idiots... Love to the rest of you"
