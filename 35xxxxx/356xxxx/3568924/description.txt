Ultimate Force is action adventure series follows the exploits of Sergeant Henno Garvie and his colleagues who make up Red Troop of the infamous SAS forces.

I think its probably one of the best TV shows EVER!
Since I dont live in England and got to see this stuff on TV, i waited for AGES for it on pirate bay. Finally I got around to buy the complete series, and so should you!
(But while you wait for it, you can get it here!;-)

I make no excuses for my crappy line out, but I will seed for a long time! Please help me seed. Its important to get this series out to the people!

Theres a total of 5 episodes in season 4.
This is my home-made DVD Rip btw.
