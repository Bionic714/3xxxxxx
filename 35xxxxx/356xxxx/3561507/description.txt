Part 3 of 4. I've checked for sync issues in this one and didn't see any, but there might still be some that I didn't pick up, but most likely not. This is Silver, the new hedgehog's story, you'll find that quite a few scenes are "shared" from other character stories you may have already downloaded, with minor differences, though some are just complete copies. I've included them just in case you didn't download the other two stories.

This is the last character story, the final part will be the hidden last episode.  I'll include a fight with the final boss at the end as well.
