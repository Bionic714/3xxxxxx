Synopsis

Emmy┬½ Award-winner Kelsey Grammer is Frasier -- the hilarious psychiatrist first seen on TV?s Cheers and subsequently the star of this smash-hit comedy series. In the complete third season of this acclaimed sitcom, Frasier (Grammer) has encounters with both a woman from his past -- Diane Chambers (Shelley Long) -- and one in his future, in the form of new radio station manager Kate Costas (Mercedes Ruehl). Niles (David Hyde Pierce) is kicked out of the house by wife Maris; Martin (John Mahoney) is exposed as a budding songwriter for Frank Sinatra; and both Daphne (Jane Leeves) and Roz (Peri Gilpin) attract some not-so-secret secret admirers! You?ll enjoy non-stop laughs in all 24 episodes of Frasier?s unrestrained third season presented in this four-disc collection.
