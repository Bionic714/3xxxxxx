,sheeba78,2006-12-01T19:04Z,"why not episode 1?
I dl from a other torrendt 1-4 and its sooo slow, so  maybe I should start with this instead."
,--Phoenix--,2006-12-01T21:03Z,"Because I thought that episode 1 is something people download to find out if they actually like the show - then if they do they wanna downlaod the remaining episodes.

(and also because I apparently deleted episode 1 from my computer lol)."

Especcially the last one.

I have a question maybe someone can help me with 
I dl  at a speed of 10 Kib/80 kb/s.
In the start it was as low as 3 Kib/s but its increased to about 20Kib now..
My upload have been steady at 12Kib.Why is it so slow when theres a lot of seeders, a good ratio seed/leech and My ratio on this has been 1.6.
I have a connection at 0.5 mb/s and my upload is about 360 kb/s or as it show in my Azereus 45 Kib/s.
I have onlu tw torrents open, and ussaly I have abot five, but I reomved those to encrease the speed here, maybe it worked becourse it has increased, but why arent other torrents affekted the same way?
I ussally dl at least 40 Kib/s on a torrent with this much seeders and leachers, and uplaod about 30Kib(1 Torrent). 
Now my speed is dl 13 Kib/s and uplaod 10 Kib/s on this torrent and 25 Kib/s 35Kib/s on both torrents I have active.

I have tried back and forth number uf uploads and number of conections, and now I have a mx connektors at 40 and max uploads at 20."

Also hope it's worth it, many friends says that the show is great!"
