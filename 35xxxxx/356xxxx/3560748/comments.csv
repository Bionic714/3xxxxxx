,Scomber,2006-11-20T15:17Z,"Due to some unknown misshap my ISP (Telia) was down during the night, so that is why no seeding was possible. It seems like they have fixed it now, so now seeding shouldn't be a problem.

I don't know if this will work on a MacBook Pro. The system is the same, so it should work. However, I think there is a torrent here with the DVDs for the MacBook Pro if this one wouldn't work.

Glad you like it :D"
,dualboot,2006-11-20T19:32Z,This program does not work on macbook pro you have to get the restore dvd`s for the pro. Thanks for posting this been waiting for a while for this. Is it possible you can upload this on usenet to get it quicker? Thanks.
,Scomber,2006-11-20T21:21Z,"Usenet? Haven't heard of it. Well, I am uploading at 100% of my capacity, pretty much ""around the clock"", so I don't know if it will get any faster than this."
,dualboot,2006-11-20T21:55Z,I`m Downloading at 2kb/s it will take about two weeks to complete using dsl. Usenet are newsgroups you subscribe to for a montly fee and you can download anything some are FREE.
,Scomber,2006-11-20T22:06Z,"It really sucks if you are getting 2 kb/s. I am uploading constantly at the rate of 80 kb/s, but if people are cheap and just leech of me without sharing to you, then there is not really a lot I can do about it. As more people get the files, hopefully the speed will go up."
,dualboot,2006-11-21T01:03Z,Where you able to burn it and boot from dvd media? You have to use dual layer media for this.
,Scomber,2006-11-21T08:35Z,"To answer your question: No, I haven't tried them. I just got the original DVDs and then used the disc utility to copy them, so they are not verified. 

If someone uses them, please verify that they work."
[T],BhangWalla,2006-11-21T13:29Z,"will verify later..

THX"
,Scomber,2006-11-24T17:39Z,"I have now uploaded 20 Gigabytes, so someone ought to have it by now?"
,vidas666,2006-11-25T23:13Z,I'm LOOKING FOR Tiger or any other relative MacOSX TORRENT witch boots on NEW INTEL due2core?! I have iMac Intel duo Core wich i forgot far away from home. I think must work this torrent on iMac? Otherweze would you please make a torrent instal disk  Tiger. Please I need My iMac alive!!!!
,Scomber,2006-11-26T15:30Z,"I have no idea if the restore DVD for MacBook will work for the new iMacs. Someone here claimed that they will not. I don't think that Apple has released a stand alone version of OSX for Intel yet, they are just bundled with the computers. "
,audiolord,2006-11-29T04:57Z,Disc 1 is corrupt. I can't open it with anything!! Disc 2 works just fine!!!
,audiolord,2006-11-30T16:44Z,Can anyone else verify disc 1 also???
,dualboot,2006-12-01T07:15Z,"Disc 1 is definitely corruped. Tried opening with ultraiso and transmac and both programs giving errors. I have ultra iso to convert .DMG to .ISO for burning in win xp used many times but file not working. Transmac converts Mac disks from a Windows PC, you can also Burn disk image files dmg, img, iso, image using win xp. Scomber can you check your files if possible post it on a newsgroup like mac.osx.apps."
,Scomber,2006-12-01T20:32Z,"I have now tried both of the discs. I double-checked disc one since some people had experienced troubles with that one. These are my results:

1. Mounting with Toast Titanium: Works
2. Mounting with Mac OS X Finder: Works

I tried to mount it with Daemontools on Windows XP, but the program could not mount it. I also experienced troubles with Nero Burning ROM under Windows XP. 

So perhaps you need a mac for this."
,audiolord,2006-12-02T04:09Z,"Scomber, could you please convert disc 1 to an ISO or .bin file and seed? I'll continue to help seeding the current set if you do."
,dualboot,2006-12-02T07:28Z,"Scomber, Daemon tools does not support .DMG files neither does nero I know that for a fact. I always use ultraiso to convert .DMG to ISO and never had a problem. Did you test the same DMG that you uploaded or did you check the original dvds. I dowloaded the macbook pro restore from here converted to iso and burned using ultraiso but macbook is not the same as macbook pro."
,Scomber,2006-12-02T16:52Z,"dualboot: I do not have the original DVDs anymore, so I tried mounting the exact same images as I have been seeding. I have no idea why you can not convert them into a ISO file since it has worked for you before. It would be really neat if you had a Mac system on which you could try them, to see if that would solve the problem. 

audiolord: I will try to see if I can convert the disc 1 image into a ISO or bin file. "
,dualboot,2006-12-03T05:39Z,"Scomber, I will try the image tomorrow on a mac system that I`m off from work. I will let you know how it went. Thanks for your support."
,Scomber,2006-12-03T22:10Z,Disc one in bin/cue format: http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3570134/Macbook_Mac_OS_X_Install_Disc_1
,dualboot,2006-12-04T05:00Z,"Tested the DMG. on a powerbook, when mounted disk utility found the file corrupt."
,Scomber,2006-12-06T20:13Z,Really weird that is works on my G5 and not on your PowerBook :S
,dualboot,2006-12-08T16:09Z,Did anyone test Disc 2? For some reason is not working for me.
,ph0bolus,2007-01-10T00:54Z,so if i have a macbook and i have azuerues on my desktop which has windows..can i download it on my desktop burn it onto dvd and put it onto my macbook?

,figarojones,2007-05-19T15:28Z,"I'm currently at 97.1%, with a 0 down rate and a 42 up rate. I promise to keep seeding after I complete it, but I need someone to please seed. "

Will this fix that?"
,borrowsw,2011-05-04T12:19Z,"On a PC a DMG file can be read and burned with poweriso.  I am also trying to download it, as I ended up with scratched DVDs which came with my macbook.  I did buy the replacements from Apple, but I cannot wait until Monday next week, I want something on it now.  If successful downloading, I will seed for a week non-stop, then only at weekends."
,borrowsw,2011-05-04T12:21Z,"Forgot to mention, PLEASE SEED this torrent."
