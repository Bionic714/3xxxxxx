The two retail DVDs that came with the MacBook. Includes OS X 10.4 \\\"Tiger\\\".
Burn the two disc images using the OS X Disc Utility.

NB: You will need DUAL LAYER burnable DVDs for this. 

I will seed about 16 hours a day, for a week or so. The speed will be quite slow at first, so be patient. 

Any comments are greatly appreciated.
