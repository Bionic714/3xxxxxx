Yes, but it's more directly clear in the Bukhari collection of Hadith."
,shazan,2007-01-01T08:58Z,This is a christian missionary's twisted translation of a book that muslim scholars consider inauthentic bc of lack of asnad . Enjoy christian shit.
,Frodo42,2007-01-08T20:12Z,"I did notice some oddities in the translation. For one, he uses 'apostle' for Muhammad, where 'messenger' would be more fitting. 'Apostle' is so closely related to the relationship between Jesus and his 12 close disciples that it's unfitting to transfer it to this context.

Also, Guillaume systematically uses 'God', where it should have been 'Allah'. The Quran uses 'Illah' for 'god', and Allah is the name of the Islamic god. It is confusing that this leads to thinking that Allah and God are the same. If you look at what they command people to do, they most certainly are not. It would be nice if the translation made this clear.

Also, using 'God' hides the fact that Muhammad used to worship Ar-Rahman in the first 10 years of his prophetic career. But once you're aware of this interesting detail, many passages in this book become much more obvious, like when the Meccans, who had worshipped Allah for over a century already, state ""You do not worship what we worship, and we do not worship what you worship.""

Knowing these things makes the translation much more usable. It's not bad in itself, there's just a few choices we'd probably do differently today."

Be Careful, Control your Tongue while talking about Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) or you'll be punished by GOD.                       "
,ahmed098765,2011-08-15T12:59Z,"The Sirat written by Ibn Ishaq only exists in a later revised and shortened version by Ibn Hisham, who died in 834 C.E, 60 years after Ibn Ishaq-- and in fragments quoted by other Muslim writers including another historian, Muhammad Ibn Jarir Al-Tabari (839-923 C.E.). Now a days it is being translated by christian scholars who does not seems to be much aware of Prophet Muhammad's (PBUH) Life
