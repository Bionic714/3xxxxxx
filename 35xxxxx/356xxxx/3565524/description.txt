The classic cult series from the 60\'s starring Patrick McGoohan as a British operative in an unidentified department who suddenly quits his job, only to be captured and taken to The Village. There a sequence of events happens to prise from him the reason why he quit.

Dreamlike, surreal and sometimes a little confusing, this series is the closest you\'ll get to tripping without dropping acid.
