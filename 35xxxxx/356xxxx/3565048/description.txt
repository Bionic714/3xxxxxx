Kristin Hersh's solo life, her "day job" she calls it, is ongoing.  

She?s recorded five solo albums  - one prior to, and four since 

Throwing Muses split: Hips and Makers (1994), Sky Motel (1997), the 

internet-only-sold Appalacian covers collection Murder, Misery and Then 

Goodnight (1998), Strange Angels (1999), Sunny Border Blue (2001) and 

now a new solo album, The Grotto.  Perhaps the most nakedly acoustic 

album she's ever made, it was recorded quick on the heels of the 

rampantly electric Throwing Muses album.

1. Hips & Maker (1994)
2. Strings (Ep 1994 - 8 tracks)
