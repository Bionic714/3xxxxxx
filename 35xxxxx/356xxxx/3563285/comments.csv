,ma678,2006-11-25T05:30Z,"It seems nothing's changed in GPS driver, which is still 1.20.
Anyone newer than that?"
,frostedsoul,2006-11-26T03:38Z,"Hi Guys, How you all doing?  Can someone explain to me, why I download the this torrent just couple KB, and there is no software file!!! Or I download the wrong thing, I'm newbie here, I don't know much about this website and I'm I'm looking for tomtom 6 software! Thanks."
,the maverick,2006-11-26T11:11Z,"frostedsoul - do not know what you did, but with BitComet, it took less than 3 minutes to download it all. Works fine, but not sure about GPS update either"
,the maverick,2006-11-26T11:15Z,"Something has changed for the better. It picks up the bluetooth of GPS in much faster time
about 1 second of turning on, long before GPS got the satellites, a further 19 seconds from cold, indoors"

,beppe_34,2007-01-05T15:19Z,"Does not install on HTC (Oxygen) S310 smartphone. But maybe this phone is not compatible with tt6? Anyhow the phone has Windows Mobile 5.0 operating system so at least the cab should install some files, but it's not. ????"
,Reeser1971,2007-01-14T04:44Z,"Question: I have downloaded this file, but I do not have a .cab file that the readme refers to.  I am working with a Dell Axim X51V with WM5.  The .rar file for WM5 is as follows:
ttn602wm5ifalleni.rar for WM2005 contains:
TTN6BT.002
TOMTOM~1.006
SETUPDLL.999
NAVIGA~1.000
BTSDKC~1.004
BTCOREIF.003
0TTTODAY.005
0000DATA.001
_setup.xml

So, I have no .CAB file like the README file refers to.  Can anyone help me out here?

Thanks."
,vaillot,2007-01-24T21:38Z,"Hi there! Have downloaded the program and installed it on my HP ipaq 6915 with integrated GPS. As GPS is integrated need no bluetooth connection to GPS, however my device tells me it can't start bluetooth anyhow due to insufficient driver memory. How do I get past this problem? One more thing: I have an ""old"" map installed on my device which I have been told would not work with Nav 6, but it does.....how come, any ideas?"
,webtracker,2007-01-26T22:22Z,"Have anyone tried this without the crack? I tried to install it without cracking it, and it seems to be working. Does anyone know what the crack is for then?"
,oddrune,2007-02-14T11:28Z,"It works great for me, but I had to downgrade my HP Ipaq HX2410 from WM2005 to WM 2004. Else, the sound didnt work. Anyone had the same prob with sound on WM2005? Anyone help me?"
,Pluto9,2007-02-25T12:13Z,Does not work with Hp HX2790. Problem with wav driver. A hard reset is needed for the sound to return...

Thanks!"
,densa695,2007-03-28T16:51Z,"HELP!

Jag har suttit i timmar nu o testat allt (nästan). När jag startar tomtom i min ipaq sår det bara att jag inte har några kartor installerade trots att jag lagt kartmappen i roten på minneskortet. Vad göra?

I've tried to get this working for several hours on my ipaq. I put the maps directory in memory vard root but tomtom keeps telling me that i have no maps installed. Any ideas?!
