,bbytew,2006-11-30T14:19Z,did not work for me. usually everything in avi works.
,Dutch_Cap,2006-12-02T11:56Z,That file should play on pretty much anything that supports DivX. What platform and media player are you using? What error messages do you get? Is anyone else having trouble?
,jigga876,2006-12-08T13:44Z,"all you have to do is install the ace mega codec packs (all the codecs youll ever need) then use winavi to convert & u good to go

,Despair_084,2008-09-03T07:05Z,"Well that was a waste of time, It's not even a valid video file, tried converting it with many programs, they all give me the same feedback.

Don't waste your time downloading this..It's not working."
