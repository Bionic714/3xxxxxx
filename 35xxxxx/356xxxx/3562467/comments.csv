,soderrm,2010-02-25T01:32Z,"some information about the torrent:

there's no menu whitch means that you need to chose subtitels via your remotecontrol...

the dvd first indicates that there only is 1h09m of the film but when you've seen to the point of 1h09m the rest of the film comes automaticly...

if you want some real shit just buy it, cuz there's some problems with this one :( "
