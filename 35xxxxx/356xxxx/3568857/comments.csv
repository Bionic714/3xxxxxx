psssst... hrsa and mac_ftw put your hands up."
,lillesvin,2008-09-04T15:09Z,"This is retarded... By definition, this will have to be indie - as If You're Feeling Sinister (1996 btw) is released on Jeepster Recordings and The Life Pursuit on Rough Trade - both independent labels i.e. indie.

Genre-wise I think discussion is stupid, but in my mind it's most definitely indie, just like every record released on Sarah Records, some of which has been a major influence on especially the early Belle and Sebastian."

Thanks for this."
