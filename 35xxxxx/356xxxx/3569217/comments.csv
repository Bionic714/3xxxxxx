,Panodilo,2006-12-02T20:39Z,"This block system is ridicilous. What if I used the block system when I do my gigolo routine at The Roxy on fridays. ""Well, sir my left nut is 30 euros, and the left one, my lil' money shot ouch, is 40 euros. If you want the whole cock too then it's going to be 110 euros. If you'd like a little utility to adjust the angle at which my staff of flesh points at your various orifices, then it's another 10 euros."""

Then when I go to fly, all I see is just a white screen.  Every once in a while after selecting other views I can see the plane for a few seconds, but it is the slowest I have ever seen a game run on my PC and then the whole screen goes white again.  I even have PMDG 747 and it runs great.  So its not my computer, I must be missing something else.  Please help.  Also, when installing it, I just used the loader and it seemed to install fine.  When I tried to click and drag the exe. file on top of the loader as instructed in one of the read me files, I just got an error message saying it cant find that exe. file.  Please help.
