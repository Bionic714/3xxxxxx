,toxic27,2006-12-02T06:19Z,"emulation must be at safedisk:P and if that dont work, use sdhide4...."
,norsemansu,2006-12-02T11:00Z,"Cheers mate, worked perfect with sdhide4"
,fent11,2006-12-02T13:08Z,"sorry to be a pain, but i was just expecting to copy and paste a crack across....Im not sure how to get this working?

I've mounted in daemon tools, but when I try and start the game it says ""insert correct CD""...Ok I thought, Ill put the crack in - but I cant find it anywhere in the file...

What is sdhide4 and exactly how do i use it?

Thanks - ive seeded this torrent anyway :-)"
,toxic27,2006-12-02T15:59Z,sdhide4 can u find at gamecopyworld.com... remember to have the newest daemon and set emulation to safedisk...... that should do it... if not try setting compadibility at fM shortcut to windows NT...... game works perfectly.... a clone shall not have crack';) this is why no more problems when patch is released....

,Loofen,2006-12-04T15:32Z,Exactly what is sdhide4? I´ve been trying to get it at gamecopyworld.com but could not find it!
,toxic27,2006-12-04T18:45Z,u dont need it loffen... look at my last comment.... do the daemon thing and set ur shortcut to windows NT... that should do it... if not search the net for sd4hide.....

,Tranty,2006-12-07T02:06Z,"@ Toxic

First of all sorry for my stupidety ;)
I have read every comment here and on the other torrent u gave here,but still i dont understand...
This is what i done : i downloaded this-installed the game-picked ""Safedisc"" on Daemon-Mounted the mds file-created a shortcut-tryed ti start and it says ""Insert Cd bla bla""

Can u tell me what i did wrong?Im fucking stupid when it comes to this things and i tryed many things for 1 hour now and im tired and angry !

Happy for a good reply....

/Tranty"
,toxic27,2006-12-07T17:14Z,"Tranty : Im sorry u have that kind of problem.. u really shouldn't have.. first u have too keep mds file mounted, and close daemon, but let emulation stay( they should aske and you press yes).. if that dont work, right click shortcut and choose properties i think( my stands on norwegian) then press compadibility.. If combadibilitymodus says windows 95 try to change to windows NT, many have made that work..  probably its only a minor thing that ruines ur playing... but its annoying either way..  have u tried ""sdhide4""??? "
,toxic27,2006-12-07T17:16Z,only safedisk shall be hooked on in emulation(daemon)....  Sdhide4 u kan find at gamecopyworld.com  just bother to look a bit... thanks guys...
