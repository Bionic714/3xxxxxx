Info:

After the fall of the military dictatorship in 1983, successive 
democratic governments launched a series of reforms purporting 
to turn Argentina into the world's most liberal and prosperous 
economy. Less than twenty years later, the Argentinians have lost 
literally everything: major national companies have been sold 
well below value to foreign corporations; the proceeds of 
privatizations have been diverted into the pockets of corrupt 
officials; revised labour laws have taken away all rights from 
employees; in a country that is traditionally an important 
exporter of foodstuffs, malnutrition is widespread; millions of 
people are unemployed and sinking into poverty; and their savings 
have disappeared in a final banking collapse. The film highlights 
numerous political, financial, social and judicial aspects that 
mark out Argentina's road to ruin.
