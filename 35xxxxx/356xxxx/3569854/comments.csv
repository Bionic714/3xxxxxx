,jonathanmoller,2006-12-28T02:09Z,"do i need the pedal to use this?

and..

is it compatible with cubase? can i use it as a plug?"
,dahmitjanet,2007-01-09T22:47Z,"Yes.. You can use it as a VST, DX or RTAS-plugin.. (Cubase use VST)..
You don't need the pedal to use it.. Just a normal ASIO-supporting audiocard.."
,Bleh,2007-02-04T11:19Z,"Thanx for this one, it adds Marshall Lead 800 and some new effects. It is the best guitar EMU IMO. Sweet stuff."
,emptyx,2007-04-07T20:47Z,"What is wrong with this Guitar rig2? 

My Cubase is just freezing evry time I open it in the VST Audio channel settings... Why? 


Skiten bara fastnar varje jävla gång! Varför?"
,3degree,2007-06-19T00:52Z,can I use this software with Pro Tools?
,3degree,2007-06-19T12:46Z,I have installed with no problems - but the software doesn't appear in my Pro Tools 7 LE. Please tell me what I can do to use it with PRo Tools  :-P
,AMD freak,2007-07-18T09:03Z,"no bugs and works 100% :)

Installed on PC using WinXP Pro w/SP2
I'm using Creative Audigy Platinum eX sound card (with external I/O box) and SB5200 5.1 speakers. I took the cover and screws off of I/O box and mounted it in my PC case :)

*** Don't expect this to work good with on-board audio sound chip cause they suck! Get a real sound card with ASIO support peeps! ***

This software is incredible and perfect for all guitar players. I'm gonna buy this software and get rig kontrol pedal to go with it!

Thanx man...""You Rock""

Better yet, dont know what that means. i use FL Stuido and my friend said that worked for amplitube 2. Would it work with this? and if so, how? and would i just plug my guitar into the mic area, or would i need a guitar to USB cable? please helpp. Thanks alot for the download btw. it was amazing and quick."
