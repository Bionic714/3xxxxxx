,Squikers,2006-11-23T13:31Z,When i try to run it thru dvdshrink it says that the data it corrupted??
,Squikers,2006-11-24T00:04Z,Yeah it runs great in PowerDvd. But how do i shink this?
,DocHOL,2006-11-24T11:36Z,Thanks! Hopefully more and more movies will be released on Piratebay as DVD9. 
,MR_1000,2006-11-24T14:08Z,"Squikers 

try to shrink it with slysofts CloneDVD i think that should do the trick"
,Pirate_Yo,2006-11-24T15:22Z,"cover?

cover till denna?"
[V],sia,2006-11-24T16:41Z,"DVDShrink misslyckades, DVDFab misslyckades, CloneDVD lyckades !!"
,maradona123,2006-11-24T23:08Z,"Man kan ju fan inte shrinka vob-filer. Vad tänker vissa med. Gör en iso-fil av alla vob,bup och ifo med poweriso eller imgburn. Sen så shrinkar du bara den med dvdshrink. "
,WildFlowerx,2006-11-25T04:08Z,"Can anyone tell me if it comes with Portuguese subtitles? 
I'd appreciate it if someone could give an answer.
"
[V],BOMM2,2006-11-25T16:47Z,"Thank you for sharing! - If you want to use DVD Shrink on this, then you must first use the FixVTS tool (or some other software to correct allocation errors in .IFO files). Google for FixVTS, it's a small and efficient tool."
,carzmellon,2006-11-26T09:13Z,"I cant get the dts audio to work when I play this, but my receiver plays back all other dts dvds. also, the regular auto (DD5.1) doesnt play in 5.1, but in dolby pro logic... anyone else have this issue?"
,drys,2006-11-26T14:03Z,your receiver need an DTS decoder. and the only diference is the sound  is a little higher. :)
,carzmellon,2006-11-26T20:21Z,"right, except my receiver DOES have a decoder"
,El Jafar,2006-11-26T23:10Z,Thanks!
,refuse2pay,2006-11-27T18:48Z,where are all the seeds please keep it up
,shelcorp,2006-11-28T17:35Z,"Is it posible to download this and burn it on a normal 4,7GB DVD disc? In that case hw do i do it?"
,Omegabite,2006-11-29T03:38Z,Seed.  This is taking forever.
,Lacke,2006-11-29T09:15Z,Thx for UL
,mr_blackpt,2006-11-30T18:59Z,Where is the Portuguese subtitles???
,drys,2006-12-01T15:38Z,"ther is errors :(
"
,drys,2006-12-01T22:38Z,"OK found the solution :)
the dvd is protected  whit som errors.

get the RipIt4Me installer and dvd decrypter and  dvd shrink.

the RipIt4Me installer which installs RipIt4Me and FixVTS is a sort of frontend, backup the pirates dvd to .iso you can use nero and save to imagedrive as iso . mount it whith daemon tools. then start  ripit4me ad select the mounted drive.


"
,drys,2006-12-02T11:36Z,"but the final result got minor errors :(

i hope this is a bad copy and not a new copy protection"
,hfw,2007-01-01T21:35Z,"I simply cant make it work !?!*

Is it copyprotected somehow, has anybody tried to burn it and does it work properly?
I could burn it riectly with Nero on a DL-disc but will that work ?

Any help ?

* Burnt it as an imagefile with Nero (.nrg) and ripped it with DVDecrypter from the virtual Deamon-driver... but I still get the same stupid error in DVD Shrink."
,sorg,2007-03-26T13:44Z,thanks drys!!! RipIt4Me worked like a charm! :) :)
,stankyG,2007-05-02T18:42Z,plz seed;)
