,Kombuchas,2010-02-14T21:00Z,not even flac? why would you do this
,gHighway,2010-06-19T18:05Z,One cannot complain about not being FLAC when you get the files in WAV format. Just thank the uploader and move on.
,cantrip,2011-03-27T18:54Z,"One *can* complain when the WAV files are upconverted from a low-bitrate MP3, thereby making the file bigger for no good reason and ensuring further quality loss if the file is converted back to MP3.

Evidence: 1. Files named *.mp3.WAV 2. Sharp frequency cutoff at 16khz. 3. The 192kbps MP3 rip I already had has no such cutoff.

Save your time and bandwidth...find this album elsewhere.
