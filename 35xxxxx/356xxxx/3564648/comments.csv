,i2mfan,2006-11-25T17:50Z,"Thanks and do what you can and I'm sure the others will appreciate that. And seeding help me seed the next one.
"
,TripleAche,2006-11-25T18:17Z,You rule i2mfan. Thanks a LOT for seeding S02 on my request. (Maybe others asked you too? :o) )  You rule!
,firstfan,2006-11-25T18:48Z,"Sorry to say but my upload speed during the day is very limited but better during the night, been uploading last 10 ep. for days now and only one ep. has the ratio 1:1, others less.  Will keep on uploading to the min 2:1"
,i2mfan,2006-11-25T18:49Z,"No other than you asked ;) and I took yesterday to reseed a few torrents that was stuck. That's why I added a paragraph in my text so others could see where it might be needed. Thanks!

Because I started with S03, I may not be able to do so often but if I do it, it will be at a much smaller speed. ""Patience"" will be the word of the day for the leechers :)

,i2mfan,2006-11-25T18:54Z,"firstfan just seed those where the ratio of seeder vs leechers is low. Yesterday, I had one with 1 seeder and 17 leechers with most with 98% done. It did not take long to finish them. I was doing surgical seeding :D  "
,i2mfan,2006-11-25T22:22Z,"I already stop seeding 1,2  when I started on S03. I count on the others to seed the 2 other seasons. :D

If I look a Porno Valley/Webdreams/BSG Webisode, it seems to work so far. I did not seed after finishing them.

Yes a DVD would be great but it's too easy to copy a DVD now. I understand them not to make it available. Maybe in HD/BD DVD if one format win. Imagine 5.1 sound with HD picture. That would be cool. if the cost is reasonable like the same price has a DVD boxset.

Spoiler warning:

All we be explained in the E01. It will make sense."

I just seen that MIS Info Video v2.3.0 is now Free(donation). I don't regret buying it and nows your chance to use it for free. I'm sure you will like it. The Resume a video is a great feature(just like on my PVR). MIV with Info2MIS makes a great combo to view movies also with the help of the .MIS.

P.S. I will copy this comment on a few of my torrents :D"
