,euclideanspace,2006-11-25T14:57Z,Thanks again Beksinski. I can split the file into 2 parts (as it is over 700mb) but I don't know how to sort out the subtitles. Any ideas?
,Beksinski,2006-11-25T17:19Z,"Download winsubtitler, it has a feature for cutting subtitle files according to the lenght of your avis:
