Tune in to CHMR(93.5 fm) Sundays from 10-1am for Apocalyptic Raids. Three hours of Crust, Grind, Power Violence, Thrash, H/C, Black Metal, NWOBHM, Crossover, Folk, and Punk Rock

This week I\\\'ll be playing:
Aura Noir-Raging Norwegian Black Thrash
Voreaphilia-For real this time
Cult Of Daath-Brutal U.S. Black Metal
Toxic Holocaust-Old School thrash Metal
WXY-Fast as shit, and pissed off New Wave

Also in my album spotlight tonight I\'ll be playing Sactuary\'s 1987 album \"Refuge Denied.\" Produced by Dave Mustaine, this is the pure 80\'s metal.
I\'d compare it to Savatage, of the same period, or in terms of vocals, to Painkiller era Rob halford, or a more subdued King Diamond.
It fucking slays, and you should check it out.
