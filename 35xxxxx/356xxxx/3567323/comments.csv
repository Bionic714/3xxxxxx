Just explore the cd and run the setup program from there! Since it is an old game, it has hardly any copyright software, so once the game is installed, you dont need to mount it with anything such as Daemon Tools. Just stick in the disc and run the game! Sorted."
,MaD>>>CoW,2007-01-31T09:00Z,"Actualy, I have just found out that once isntaled, the game doesn't require a disc to run. 

So IN YOUR FACE! You DON'T need a fix, you DON'T need to mount it or any crap like that, you DONT need a no-cd crack, but you DO need a life. "

,jrockpunk1,2009-03-18T17:44Z,"OK guys, this DOES work. First, use download daemon tools, it's the only nrg mounter that works. Run daemon MANUALLY (don't right click the file and click mount). On the task tray right click and get to the CD drive, then click mount image. Browse to the nrg file and mount it. It will say something about it being corrupted/dirty disk when you try to run it. But it WILL have mounted. Go to my computer, and right click the drive it's mounted on and click explore. Double click the setup.exe file and et voila it should work. It wasn't hard to figure out.

You have to manually execute the setup.exe inside the disc and it will install ok."
