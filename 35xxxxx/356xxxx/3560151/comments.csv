,uraphake,2006-11-19T06:51Z,"Thank you!
This is the first rip that's great quality. Everything else up to now has been crap."
,Supremus,2006-11-19T07:30Z,"All my rips are authentic DVD rips, not screeners."
,uraphake,2006-11-19T10:59Z,"I meant to say that this is the first Ice Age 2 rip I've found which is great quality. If your other DVD rips are like this one, then they must be great as well. Thanks again!"
,uber1,2006-11-21T23:41Z,Is it posible to burn it on an dvd?
,uraphake,2006-11-22T07:52Z,"Uber1 asked: ""Is it posible to burn it on an dvd?""

Yes, you can -- if you have an app like VSO ConvertXtoDVD it's easy. You should find more than a couple of torrents on TPB for it."

Dude u rock!"
,marmour,2006-12-17T03:04Z,"How do I burn to Nero - Use Nero Vision it will transcode to DVD. Select Create DVD (not editable), add video files, select a menu (however I have had problems with no menu so maybe you may want a menu), Otherwise write to disk and then do a Nero Recode. Then select your DVD write. Your golden."
