Yes, Islam sucks.
And yes, Christianity also sucks.
Yet, I know both Muslims and Christians who are *good* people. Not all Muslim are Fundamentalist and not all Christians are born-again morons.
I think we should fight both Muslim *and* Christian/jewish fundamentalism, while allowing people to worship whatever they want to, as long as they don't try to force their own beliefs/moral values upon others."
,Deznaj,2006-11-26T12:54Z,"Well LucisFrerens, forcing their own beliefs/moral values upon othersthat's exactly what they do!

In our society, free speach is the greatest good. In the Muslim (and lesser extend Christian) believe, their religion is the greates good. So you can't say that their religion is a hatefull piece of shit or they will blow you up (e.g. the Dutch Theo van Gogh manbearpig-murder).

Some people who are Muslim (or Christian) deserve respect, not because they believe but because they act like humans. Others who just follow the books without any common sense should be 'put to sleep'."

I don' t want to be rude but for many years that one forced african countries to become christians to ease the slavery, and now the spot is terorist muslims. Watch syriana = A good example for this conflict.

,rimad_,2006-11-26T17:41Z,"Deznaj, you make no sense dude. Of course one is gonna defend his religion, isn't that normal? like you defend your name, your personality? There is no religion in the world that will teach you evil things. Propaganda that got your guys lately is a mechanism great people like Bush uses to make you scared, nothing else. Yes, arabs are a bit ...stubborn, but arabs != muslims, there are christians there too. Muslims live all around the world. Do not confuse Religion with Nationality."
,raf999,2006-12-05T02:06Z,"If Mohammed is bad, read the Talmud- Sanhedrene section XXXXXXII: On how I hate Jesus and how to eat a camel upside down after one hour of bloodletting.

Section XXXXXIIII of Gommorha: proper passing in the fire of children for Moloch

well, at least the Muslims don't know what their ""profit"" wrote, as opposed to the jews who are just plain evil and believe in whatever their leaders say."

,Krakie,2007-01-21T00:44Z,"Both Jesus, Son of Man and Muhammad, peace and blessing be upon him, explained that he or she that does good with their time and energy in this life on earth, is blessed with peace, prosperity, love and wisdom. 


I am sad that brothers do not recognize each other. 

I am sad we judge too quickly even to consider why we judge. 

I am sad when we choose hate instead of love. 


Listen you full of hate! 

Hate is the mask of fear! 

You are fearful! 

The splendour of unfolding Creation has confused you, 

for you understand it not. 


You close your eyes and see not that religions are but different expressions of the One truth. 


Don't you understand that hate is darkness and love is the light."
,socratus,2007-08-14T22:52Z,"stupidness - not asking questions, talking without knowledge, making accusations without proof and offcourse making STUPID STATEMENTS. Ask yourself: ""Am I stupid?""

,DaddyHorseSense,2008-02-08T16:47Z,"Islam is the perversion of Christianity into pure evil, done by a fool, possibly insane, in order to give himself power and cover up the fact that he was an outcast due to his cowardice on the field of battle.
Islam is nothing but Satanism for the ignorant."
,knoxbox,2008-02-14T21:17Z,"OMG... why do people always feel they need to fight their side, don't you people understand that geting into a religious debate is just purely unethical and rude... it does nothing but start wars that have no respectable ending. believe what you want and let other believe what they want... and when people come and ask you what you believe say it with pride and respect towards other peoples beliefs... the best way to pull people towards your religion is to live it and let them see through you. pressure is never the way to go."
