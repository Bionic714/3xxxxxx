,obiwanbill,2006-11-21T19:31Z,"Hmm ... this is the first Torrent I am seeding. I am having a bit of a problem. The only person who can access it is me, on another computer behind my Firewall.

I UPnP'ed the port both UDP & TCP.

The error I am getting is ... ""Problem connecting to Tracker""

When I filled out the form to post a Torrent on this web site, I used this ... ""http://tpb.tracker.thepiratebay.org/announce""

Any ideas?

Thanks in advance ...

,obiwanbill,2006-11-21T19:38Z,"I am using Bittorrent 5.0.1

I was on BitTorrent's web site and they say there is a problem making torrents with 5.0.

Hey guys, save this Torrent file and try downloading it later today. I will try to use an older version of BitTorrent.

Thanks,

Bill"

,ShadowBullet,2008-08-01T15:51Z,"to seed you must open the required port on your router.  on utorrent go to options/speed guid.  it will have a port and a test port button.  click the button and it will tell you if the port s open your not.  if its not you must get into your router and open the port under applications and gaming and set the information to be sent to your computer.  your ip address within your network should start like this, ""192.168.1.1"".  to find your computers specific ip address follow this pathway start/run/cmd/  once u open your cmd window type ipconfig.  "
,ShadowBullet,2008-08-01T15:52Z,"this will tell you your ip address.  take that number and forward theport to your ap address and you should be able to send and receive everything.  welcome to the interwebz, do a barrel roll."
