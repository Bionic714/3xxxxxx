Spriggan is a REALLY violent, classic anime movie.  It's sort of light on plot, but easily as violent as Ninja Scroll.

This, along with Akira, Fist of the North Star and Ninja Scroll, is one of my favorite movies to introduce people to Anime for the first time."

Can someone please reseed this? I have 99.9% complete. I'll seed this for a long time if I can finish the d/l. There hasn't been a seed for weeks. Thanks!"
