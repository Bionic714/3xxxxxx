,pottan-,2007-08-25T17:53Z,"Thanks a lot for upload, I didn't have the album ""Shock me"". The original name of ""Red House Painter 1"" is actually ""Rollercoaster"" and the original name of ""Red House Painter 2"" is ""Bridge"".

Mark Kozelek are the most underestimated singer/songwriter ever in my opinion. "
