Red House Painters is an alternative rock group formed in 1989 in San 

Francisco by singer/songwriter Mark Kozelek. They are described, along 

with American Music Club, as one of the lynchpins of the slowcore 

movement in alternative rock. Kozelek used this group primarily as a 

vehicle for his very personal and emotional songs of despair, pain and 

suffering.
