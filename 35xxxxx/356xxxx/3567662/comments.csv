,Idolsys,2006-12-05T18:02Z,One Seeder who has 50 people pulling from him. Dude limit your connections so you can get a few people to help seed.
,akous1974,2006-12-06T01:52Z,"I'd love to limit the connection but I can't find out how.  I'm using BitTorrent and it's pretty limited.  Once it's downloaded and a few people have it, I'm switching to uTorrent. Sorry everybody, I have the entire bandwidth allocated to this torrent to speed it up. "
,Idolsys,2006-12-07T17:02Z,"Well please, please don't stop it now. 5 days at finally at 85%, maybe just another 3 to go ;)"
,akous1974,2006-12-08T05:50Z,"Not to worry Idolsys and everybody else.  I'll seed untill everybody get's the whole thing.  I've been having problems with the tracker droping and losing the connection. If you see the connection lost, it's not me, just the tracker not working. I hope they fix TPB fixes it."

,akous1974,2006-12-12T04:04Z,"jan6340, you need to burn the files to DVD using something like NERO.  If using NERO, choose DVD-Video Files and select all files that you downloaded. Accept the defaults and name your DVD IceAge2. The name doesn't matter, but since you downloaded IceAge2 you might as well call it that ;)  Once the burn is complete, place your new DVD in a player and enjoy."
