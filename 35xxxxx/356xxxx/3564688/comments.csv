,akrako1,2006-11-26T21:42Z,will this run OK on a single core AMD XP-64 3200+?
,Snooters,2006-11-28T07:53Z,can't you read 2 comments above?
,akrako1,2006-11-30T03:04Z,Notice the ? at the end of the above post.  I think it's a question...
,Iddiz,2006-12-09T21:03Z,"Vad betyder det att det är en ""corporate version""? Denna är alltså på engelska? Finns det någon på svenska? Vore tacksam för länk. 
Funkar denna på en AMD TURION 64 3400+ (ML), inte en X2 utan bara en kärna?

Mkt tacksam för svar!
VH/Iddiz

What does it means that it's a ""corporate version""? This one is in ENG, not SWE? Is there a x64 with SWE out? Does this one works on an AMD TURION 64 3400+ (ML), a single core (not the x2 duo core!!!)?

Thanks/Iddiz"
,tugunska2,2006-12-14T20:08Z,"does this release has a definitive activation??
or will work only for 30 days??

thanks for the release."
,scofield34,2006-12-15T02:09Z,Will 32-bit programs (ex. games) still run on 64-bit platform when installed?
,Vecna,2006-12-19T14:15Z,"Yes 32-bit games will work in 64-bit OS. As for corporate it means that it should be without serial activation, however if someone would have integrated this OS with the SP2 you would need a key I belive as there is no ""official"" version out with that integrated..."
,uip1280,2006-12-22T09:26Z,how can i update this version?

,Psycadelic,2006-12-30T20:33Z,"Could someone confirm if this Release is working with Single core CPU's? Because this has been downloaded about 2000 times, and noone has answered if this release is forced at Dualcore CPU's or not? Because i got a very new computer, but the CPU is only SingleCore.

Thanks for the answers, and i wish you all a happy new year."
,Psycadelic,2006-12-30T20:43Z,"Btw, Cdkey? Is it shown when installing? or don't you need one at all? Can't find anything about Cdkeys. Thanks bye."
,Psycadelic,2006-12-31T16:58Z,"WARNING!

When downloading this Windows XP cd, be sure to know that when its installed, takes about 10-15 minutes, No cdkey needed, Almost fully automatic.

When you get inside Windows xp, you'l get 1 problem, a serious one, TCP Port Denied, Said something about TCP Port Closed and can't be used, I couldn't even start a Game, Neither could i download anything with Utorrent, it said the same problem as posted above.

I do not recommend this at all, i once had a Windows Xp x64 copy from a friend, swedish version, and it didn't have this problem at all, This is a unique problem that i've never seen before, I've tried my things to make it work, but i couldn't.

I recommend just about anything else but this, Great installation, No Driver problems, Nice Look when you get inside Windows, but the problem will be there, You could either chose to Download this piece of crap, or go get something else. 

Goodluck :)"
,tokerrr,2007-01-04T23:44Z,"please seed, thanks :)"
,tokerrr,2007-01-05T10:22Z,"Thanks for the product, but goes a bit slow, I'll love more seeders though. Thanks again for seeding ;)"
,Merkill,2007-01-05T16:24Z,"works but i had to get some vista drivers for sound due to nvidia drivers didnt work.

But i have a big problem i can not set standard place to download anything in any program.
ex. if i try in utorrent then i try browse i cant if i type in manualy where torrent is to be placed in future i cant."
,tokerrr,2007-01-05T19:51Z,"It works fine for me, and I got no problem with tcp, so that must be something you did wrong or your computer.
One problem I have though is sound, I cant find any audo driver, I found it to my computer but wont support os, any ideas? :)
thanks also, it works great."
,Merkill,2007-01-05T20:05Z,"i use 64bit vista driver from mobo manufacturer
works so far have not tried gaming yet but music is fine.

changed to another xp64 version now thou due to the cant browse bug i had in this one"
,4nr-,2007-01-07T17:11Z,"this works fine on any 64bit processor, single core too.  There is no such thing as a seperate version for dual core processors.  Tested on my Athlon64 3200+"
,passionsurf,2007-01-13T20:35Z,"I have intel pent D dual core, but it won't let me boot x64 from CD (however, I can boot the 32bit version from CD).  Is there a boot disk available for x64?"
,dorkeydude22,2007-01-14T17:11Z,"This download works, but it is buggy. Save as dialogue box shows no drives in ""my computer,"" The text is missing from ""my documents,"" Programs freeze when trying to install (like photoshop CS2 that installs just fine on 32bit). 
I do not recomend this version if you are looking for a good install for your new 64 bit systems."
,passionsurf,2007-01-14T17:48Z,"dorkeydude, what version would you recommend then a 64bit system? "
,4nr-,2007-01-18T21:30Z,"passionsurf,
Your processor is not 64bit so this won't work on your pc.   "
,rumble291,2007-01-21T21:14Z,Windows X64 is the 64 bit of Windows so will work with Single core 64 bit processors e.g. athlon 64 3000
,rumble291,2007-01-22T17:25Z,"The theme sucks, the start menu arragement is shite i set it back in properties. Some of the names on folders are missing apart from that its alright and single cores work fine on it. If u can only find this X64 edition then get it otherwise save the trouble of changing everything back and get a different one. Oh and for 1GB of RAM ive got 1GB and ive got 700MBs free which is the same on Windows XP (32-bit)"
,RekkaOne,2007-02-17T17:40Z,is their a s/n with this download?
,RekkaOne,2007-02-18T02:49Z,"sry, missed the part about the s/n.

but I cant get it to work, how do I burn the dvd to work? I unpacked the iso file and used nero and chose make bootable dvd.  but when i restart my computer the dvd starts to read some files and when its done it just stop in dos at A: and from their I dont get the installation to start. I use a external dvd device, can that be a problem?"
,Compote,2007-03-20T14:32Z,"DON'T donwload this Windows. Burning blank disks doens't work, but used disks work (DVD RW). Sometimes button ""Browse"" doesn't also work at programs and installers. You can check with Nlite 1.3. Search only work from Start button. Don't work half of audio track in video files containing 2 audio tracks and more. "
,ccmgb178,2007-03-25T03:30Z,Is this SP2 or SP1?
,ccmgb178,2007-03-25T03:31Z,Is this SP2 or SP1?
,lin_ay,2007-04-08T02:41Z,"Hey SEED!

please seed 
please be ashamed of your damn ratio!"
,theris,2007-04-13T20:02Z,"it has so many bugs. always loads the ""administrator"" account without asking for password, if i make another administrator account and delete the old one, it recreates itself after every boot and loads up. the ""browse for folder"" window always shows up empty, so it's impossible to set default plug-in directory for your application. i don't have the net connection icon in the system tray.. i could go on. it was a waste of time for me."
