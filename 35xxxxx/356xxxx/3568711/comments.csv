,AssMaster,2006-12-01T20:26Z,"thanx, I'm gonna check it out :) discographies like this are hard to find!"
,pizzatomte,2006-12-01T20:49Z,Sweet!
[V],Kefissos,2006-12-01T21:39Z,"Assmaster: Trust me, its really great music of Xymox. I have upload lot of music from 4AD, because it was needed here in PirateBay. More will be upload. Just enjoy the music ;-)"
[V],Kefissos,2006-12-08T23:22Z,"Folks, listen! You HAVE to SEED, when my upload are finish...Are you really so selfish? If you won't, I can't upload ANY great music anymore."
[V],Kefissos,2006-12-09T00:54Z,"I have already deleted an upload of the band Lush...sorry Guys, its your own fault, if you can't seed."
,Gortie,2006-12-16T20:10Z,"Yep yep. The Clan is great. In fact, it seems you and I share a lot of good music taste hehe. Basically anything with ""4AD"" on it is good (except perhaps for Cornershop *barf*).

I'm thinking about maybe adding a torrent with TMC and their ""idiot bastard son"" (their quote hehe) The Hope Blister. I think I have the rare album ""Underarms"" somewhere as well. I just need to find the time to rip them. =)"
,vedovelli,2007-11-10T13:45Z,"Great! Thank you so much for share. I'm actually seeding and will be for at least 1 week.

Regards from Brazil,

This is so great. Many Thx!"
,VicariousX,2008-04-05T18:58Z,"Great albums, but some of the id3 tags are completely FUCKED. Songs under the wrong band name (CoX/Xymox), wrong track numbers, some of them are just missing those things altogether, etc.

You can fix them yourself, but it takes a bit of time and you have to wait until you've finished seeding at least 100%..."
[V],Kefissos,2008-04-07T21:24Z,"VicariousX 
I ripped all the albums from my own CD collection. What happens after 2. years, I upload the torrent, I haven't any idea. Besides I use Linux and any virus comes from computer."

,Franoz,2008-11-11T11:47Z,As always thanks for the upload Kefissos.  For the purists among you this might sound too mainstream - still - interesting to re-discover
,Astenu666,2008-12-15T00:04Z,"Saw them live yesterday in the P60 here in their native country, the Netherlands :)
It was a great to see them live, they really radiate a contentment with what they are doing.

You are really making my day with this extensive collection of obscure Clan of Xymoxness!

Thanks a lot!
