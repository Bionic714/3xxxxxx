The Pinnacle software itself is a joke, but that's not my fault."
,niklazfin,2006-12-30T22:42Z,"I have downloaded this update through the real Pinnacle server - I'm sure this is the real deal too.

However, whenever I install the update it says ""initialization failed"" during the installation and now I can't start the software... Suggestions?"
,seedaren (bra dator),2007-02-03T11:45Z,"The real to do when it says that the patch doesn't worl is to reinstall the program, because the patch doesn't work if you have putted the crack first do like this:

1. First you install the game or software

2. then patch is you have to

3. then crack (crack is the final thing you do)

if you don't do like that way the patch doesn't work because you have to have the REAL .exe that follow with the patch... not a fake one :D Hope that'll do it...

,seedaren (bra dator),2007-02-03T11:47Z,"and, that is the trick you ""asked"" for... because the activation is like a crack because you don't have the right cd-key..."
,Meladori,2007-05-14T19:56Z,"You can also download the patch right here:
