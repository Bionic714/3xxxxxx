,Assasinos,2006-12-07T19:02Z,"Ok, but these are some part of the full version (2h), and any tags will don't pass."
,black curtian,2006-12-09T19:45Z,"your both retards

there is no ac\dc ""best of"" album
or greatest hits
the nearest albums to an acdc ""best of"" 
are the US and UK release of high voltage, its kind of a 'best of ' the high voltage and t.n.t. australian releases, and family jewels.

do some research dumbass...anything titled 'best of' 'greatest hits' etc... is nothing more than someones favorite acdc tracks that they compiled into a folder.

you stupid fucks are pathetic and dont know shit about ac\dc"
,ewokbabe,2007-07-02T10:27Z,"Right there with ya, Black Curtain. I thought this was a bit odd to see a ' Best of ' AC/DC. In all actuality, if you know anything about AC/DC you know that all of their albums are the best of the band, they don't need to release an album with a few selections of each album."
,Firesire1,2008-12-29T14:00Z,Thx anyway!
,dave1235,2009-01-23T00:10Z,"Man you AC/DC fans are rude people. (Maybe its all the drugs)
Note that the title while having the words ""Best of"" also has the words ""by assasinos""
That being said without the songs titles it is not as useful as it could be. Although if you import them with itunes, itunes will add the titles.
Its the right bit rate though and I'm downloading it"
