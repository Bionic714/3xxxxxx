,Jocke666,2006-12-01T12:27Z,Thanks!
,reiEX,2006-12-01T17:40Z,Can i ask why there's no english subtitle?
,Hewlett,2006-12-01T23:56Z,"subs are the .SRT files.
You need directvobsub or ffdshow to watch them on top of the movie."
,reiEX,2006-12-02T03:06Z,Cool! Thankz very much now i get it and can watch already ^_^
,UniC,2006-12-03T00:36Z,Now i want the part two ^^
,warpengi,2006-12-07T09:47Z,"yah, kissboll.  That was excellent.  Can you get part2?"
,kissboll,2006-12-07T21:18Z,ya welcome! :]
,kissboll,2006-12-07T21:20Z,"The easiest way to see the subs is to right click in VLC and select subtitle.

I don't know if part 2 is out just yet. Part 1 was aired June 17th (and is out now). Part 2 was aired the 4th of November and is called ""Death Note: the last name"". But i haven't seen it. nor the subs. So if you do please upload or give me a  honk..."
,kissboll,2006-12-07T21:22Z,"Continuing my previous post... (to long to post)

Meanwhile I can recommend the Anime with the same name. Not entirely the same plot as the movie (in fact i think it's better). The anime is currently at ep 9. (both subbed and raw) and with about double as much to go I'd reckon. It airs every Tuesday, i think but the subbed version is delayed a couple of days since it's fan-subbed...

TBC.... (to long to post...)"
,kissboll,2006-12-07T21:27Z,"Continuing...

I can recommend the versions subbed by live-evil and they can be found at e.g. mininova(Or, if you want I can upload them here in a big pack).

,kissboll,2006-12-07T21:33Z,"Hmmm... acualy it wasn't that my posts where to long that i got the ""Internal error"" It was because i had ""m-i-n-i-n-o-v-a.o-r-g"" in my text. (try it yourself)... 

anyway, sry about that =/... too bad you can't edit/delete your posts"
,warpengi,2006-12-08T15:27Z,"thanks for the info kissbol.  I'll try the anime while waiting for part 2.

Hey, thanks for sharing.  That's why they'll never kill P2P, we have the power of good on our side."
,myobi,2006-12-26T19:00Z,"hi! mine isnt working!

the sound's working but i dont see anything!

any suggestions? :("
,kissboll,2006-12-26T19:15Z,"myobi:
yeah. try downloading the CCCP-codec pack.
you can find it at: http://www.cccp-project.net/
(Mediaplayer classic is included and a good player)

Or you can try to play it with VLC which can be found at http://www.videolan.org/

kisses"
,myobi,2006-12-26T19:40Z,"nooooooo, i downloaded the cccp but its said that i didnt have the needed codec or filters and i only got the sound working so im downloading the other one and hopefully it will work!
"
,myobi,2006-12-26T19:48Z,YESSSS!! I DOWNLOADED A CODEC PACK AND IT WORKS THANKYOUUUUUU SOOO MUCH KISSBOLL! I LOVE YOU! XD LOL!
,Heero14,2007-01-02T22:56Z,Is this from the retail DVD or the TV version?
,Jac90,2007-01-05T12:45Z,"How to Activate The Fan Sub for this movie..??
I Tried Downloading, ffdshow and directvodsub and still i see no Subs on my Video LAN player... What must i do to make the subs appear?? TELL ME!!!"
,Smosh91,2007-01-05T17:45Z,"No image,only sound on VLC  :(
The every other mdeia program the movie ''chops'' . Somone who now's what i should do ? 
"
,Smosh91,2007-01-05T17:47Z,on evry other media program the movie chops *
,kissboll,2007-01-09T17:30Z,"myobi: good for you :D

heero14: This is the first episode (out of two) from the tv-series.

Jac90: if you use VLC. right-click when the movie is playing and select subtitles -> track one...
If you use Media PLayer Classic (6.4.9.0 or later) the sub will appear automatically.
If not. check so you have both the avi-files and the srt-files in the same folder and that they have the same name.

Smosh 91: download the CCCP-codecpack -> install -> use ""media player classic"" which is included in the CCCP... (can be found in a subfolder in CCCP or in the start-menu)

,kissboll,2007-02-05T10:33Z,"Zolloz:

acually you're wrong. There is a version out. But the quality is outrageous bad and there are no subs.

1 seed...."
,kissboll,2007-02-08T20:18Z,"vamosamorir:
Couldn't agree with you more. But this is tpb. no one gives a shit here (except maybe you and me). At least I'm still seeding. 
got some mighty 1112GB (and growing) uploaded now :)

Anyway, can't everybody who's grabbin' this stay and seed to at least 1.0. 
or is that too much to ask for?

zolloz:
Yeah, hopefully some day soon ^^,
didn't see it either cuz' of the crappy quality. "
,kissboll,2007-02-11T23:08Z,"I can gladly bring an update on the DN part 2 movie:
(source kloofy.net)

____QUOTE:____
""The official release date of the DVDs is something like March 16th or so... plus minus a day.

But from what I understand, the official DVDs will NOT have subs. They're JP, region 2, releases.

And Hell-Fansubs posted on their website today that they've begun subbing ^^

,ZwizzeR,2007-03-13T19:46Z,"Worked no problem for me, great upload. The translations are pretty bad though, lots of errors. But ya get through the movie anyway."
,vonigan,2007-07-01T09:05Z,"I have no audio!
just subtitles.
anyone know why? 
I use the VLC player it that helps at all..."
,kissboll,2007-09-13T16:43Z,"vonigan:

sorry for a late reply.
its probably because of some weird audio setting (like .1 surround, when you've only got stereo)

right click when the film is on. choose audio ""device"" and the one you are using e.g. stereo.

if that doesnt work. rightclick again, choose ""audio track"" and select another one until it works.

good luck."
,2-drock,2007-09-29T04:01Z,plz seed its not even downloading!
,2-drock,2007-09-30T20:49Z,ok how do u get the subs to work? when i play it its in jap with no subs .....
,2-drock,2007-10-01T22:07Z,ok I got subs to work i need to find part 2
,aceseeder,2007-11-29T08:05Z,the subbing translations have really bad grammer lols. I'm going through it and editing grammer and vocab. it wont be perfect but itll be better. if u want ill give u guys a download link for it. if im allowed. and when im finished.
,gameric3,2007-12-06T02:27Z,Is there a vision with English dubs?
,aceseeder,2007-12-11T00:39Z,nope i dont think so.
,danne9113,2008-01-23T03:13Z,"ty for great uppload =D

Please upploade part 2 when it comes out."
,GumGumCaptain,2008-08-04T07:16Z,"hey, thanks for the upload. as others have said, the subtitles aren't quite that good in the eyes of native speakers, but if you're interested, i'd be willing to work with you to edit them and make them more suitable for american death note fans :D"
,psphackerowned,2008-09-12T12:45Z,theres an english dubb coming out some time look at the wiki
,LightenLhar,2009-06-18T09:30Z,"I try to seed 2.0 before I delete, and by then I'm done with the file anyway, it pisses me off though when the last seed disappears right before I finish! Never stop if you're the last one seeding, please!"
