,El Jafar,2006-11-23T23:44Z,A torrent is only about 100k. 60 torrents=5.14MB.
,El Jafar,2006-11-24T09:34Z,"igotGOTH: About 1. If you have used TPB search function, you'll know what I mean. Last time I put up this torrent, there were a lot of people who liked it. If you don't like it, then don't download it."
,kimjor2,2006-11-24T12:21Z,thanx El jafar.dont listen to those retards!this is a helpful torrent.
,El Jafar,2006-11-24T13:02Z,"Thanks kimjor2! I don't listen to them. Whereever you go there are always someone like them. Luckily, they are in a minority."

,js55,2006-11-25T09:47Z,"EL JAFAR

Thumbs up"
,El Jafar,2006-11-26T09:26Z,"I wondered what category you place torrrents to other DVDRs, but if you searching for olirc's DVDRs this is the category you will search for. If I had placed it under other-other no one would have found this helpful torrent.

Btw, when you grow older you will learn not to use words like ""retard"" in public as it only shows your bad manner."
,Star_Trek_DK,2006-11-27T09:21Z,Is there not other subs like danish?
,El Jafar,2006-11-27T22:53Z,"No, only swedish subs."

,Wirrwarr,2006-12-16T17:55Z,"Hi folks,

,Wirrwarr,2006-12-17T22:09Z,".... and away we go. Lovely, thanks a million."
,meowist,2007-03-11T02:59Z,"Could someone please seed 26, 19, and  27? I've been stuck at 95-98% for a while on those. "
,arthurvandijk,2007-03-12T17:40Z,"Hi guys... Thx for the torrent, but can someone please (re)seed DVD 25, 26 and 31? I'm stuck at 92 - 99 % for a loooong time now... Of course, I'll keep seeding in return. Thanks!"

,hotspice,2007-03-22T07:59Z,"Nice upload, El Jafar!
Makes it much easier to find the right one.

Has anybody seen torrents of ST Voyager season 3. Preferably w/ nordic subs?"
,El Jafar,2007-03-22T11:48Z,"Thanks hotspice!
No, I have only seen VOY S3 in the english version yet."
,hotspice,2007-03-22T15:20Z,"Never mind!
I said I prefer nordic subs, but can do w/o in case of emergency ;-)"
,El Jafar,2007-03-23T00:18Z,"Sorry! I thought about the Enterprise S3. I have seen VOY S3 with nordic subs, but I can't find them anymore. Check out http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3469109/Star_Trek_Voyager_season_4_disc_7_PAL_DVDR
that have links to all. You can also check the uploaders personal page:
http://thepiratebay.org/user/gazcoo
http://thepiratebay.org/user/brennebjarne
Maybe you could ask them to reseed S3?"
,hotspice,2007-03-23T11:49Z,"Thanks for the advice, El Jafafar. But the seeds were erased some time ago. I will however try to contact brennebjarne and gazcoo. It seems that a lot of people lack VOYAGER S3 'cause there are lots of requests floating around."
,DocNielsen,2007-04-05T06:33Z,"Anyone else need a reseed on any of the 60 disks?
I'm currently seeding 40-60, but i can find some diskspace for more, if needed."
,twnykil,2007-04-07T11:45Z,"Toppen för en gammal Trekkie.
Synd bara att seedning är dålig. Seeda please."
,twnykil,2007-04-28T19:03Z,"Please help! Could someone seed DVD28,31,33,36,54 and 55. Only a few percent remain for completion."

Could someone please reseed DVD 59, I will let it seed for a few weeks so that other people stuck will also finish there downloads.

Thanks to the good soul that will do that..."
,Orloxed,2007-06-10T08:24Z,"All I want is the episode ""Frame of mind"" really so I just want to make sure that it is STTNG49.iso that has it on there. 

Also if someone feels like seeding :D

Many thanks."
,El Jafar,2007-06-12T13:21Z,"BlueRodeo: Very welcome!
Orloxed: olirc has probably made his list correct. BTW, DVD49 has been seeded.  :)"
