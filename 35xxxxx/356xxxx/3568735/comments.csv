,Bixxx,2006-12-07T15:48Z,"Does anyone happen to have the files used for the tutorial projects at hand? Would be a nice and appreciated upload!
;-)

(and if I am simply being daft, asking for something that is already there - do please point me in the right direction, becuase I can't find the media files)

Thnx!

And by the way, Magsy - that is one HELL of a torrent to start out with!
;-D"
,jersey73,2006-12-18T06:40Z,i am unable to download what is the problem
,joeydee,2006-12-28T00:01Z,"Hey Magsy :)

I just started my download - I'm new to Torrents - actually this is my first time using it (im using Tomato) and it's telling me there is 19hours left for the download to finish, is that normal?

Also it's 100% it works without a SERIAL?"
,derprozzessor,2007-01-06T03:47Z,"i can't dl the file although there are 36 seeders allegedly...
i become stuck with 40 percent.
can someone please seed?

thanx

,nabounds,2007-04-08T22:13Z,When I try to open the disk image it says it is incomplete and may damage my system.  There are no mountable file systems in the package...?

,caine3320,2008-05-20T21:38Z,"thanks for the up! will seed as long as possible.

eggbeaterman- universal refers to Universal Binary, which means it will run on pretty much any mac, including their (relatively) new intel machines; it has nothing to do with windows"
,rizzofsp,2008-05-22T03:35Z,Just tried it.  Says it may damage my system. There are no mountable file systems.  Is there a work around?  
,urubuzada,2008-07-28T16:36Z,"I tried. But the message says: "" May damage your system. No montable files"". Is there any one who knows what's all about?"
,agniwire,2008-08-30T00:32Z,"Can someone please explain this to me? If this torrent was uploaded in December 2006 how come it's 4.1 which is the version up to date august 2008?

,JimmyHat408,2009-01-08T12:03Z,"Hey all, im not new to TPB but i do have a noob question. im a mac user and i use ""bits on wheels"" when i am dloading a torrent i really want and i finally get it i want to be able to seed to others as well. i have my ulRate set correctly no firewalls or any of that crap. people connect to me and do DL but they either disconnect very quickly or receive very little from me. is there any way to help me maximize the amount of people i can connect to and the amount of data i can UL to them? i know ""bits on wheels"" has its issues but it has served me extremely well and i seem to get torrents super fast so i want to return the favor. any help would be appreciated - jimmyhat"
,charlie18,2009-01-23T02:46Z,can someone seed this please?
,p-nipple,2009-02-02T07:53Z,"Well, it wants a serial from me!  Also, had to Disk Utility-restore the .dmg to another HD in order to get at the installer packages.  No KCN or SerialBox numbers to be had....any advice?"
,YpsiFrog,2009-04-09T15:54Z,"well now I have it thanks,  & Seeding"
,Imackster,2010-01-21T00:30Z,"I just downloaded.  Worked like a charm, no problems, no SN, nothing!  Just installed, clicked on the application icon and Shake is up and running on my Mac!"
