,Sussu,2006-12-18T00:11Z,episodes 7 and 8 are the same
,Trotyl,2006-12-18T17:33Z,That's unfortunate.... well I didn't do the rip...
,Sussu,2006-12-18T23:15Z,"thanks anyway! i just mentioned those things to help other downloaders to identify the episodes, haven't yet figured out which is which :)"
,spaceace,2007-01-04T10:59Z,Ther is another episod missing too. I have not identiefied wich one yet. 
,spaceace,2007-01-05T18:08Z,Theres 3 episodes missing and the episodes comes in the wrong order. Theres also 2 episodes from season 4...
,]osh42O,2007-02-10T05:42Z,Why in the hell cant this shit be complete and in the right order?!  It's obvious it came from the DVDs!
,purple69,2007-02-11T11:22Z," S03E09 - Changes (prod 3007) 
and S03E24 - Like an Old Time Movie (prod 3003) are missing !
 there is a confusion between the production and air order and maybe who did the rip didn't know."
,Trotyl,2007-03-13T13:47Z,It ain't my Rip. I got them frpm another tracker
,ozzikk323,2007-05-05T20:12Z,"Could somebody do me a favour a say which episode in this package is about that kleptomaniac friend of Tanners. I only know that this one is called  ""Have You Seen Your Mother Baby Standing In The Shadow?"".
I'd be veeeeery grateful..."
,jupiler76,2008-03-13T19:11Z,"Quite a job to get them in right order, but it is surely worthwhile!  Episodes 9, 15 and 24 are missing.  Trying to dl them now.  Will seed when ready.  Anybody know where to get Project ALF, the movie?  Tx for the upload Trotyl!"
[T],Filmofiel,2008-10-10T17:38Z,"This torrent is worthless, actually episodes 9,15 en 24 are missing, episodes 7 and 8 are the same, and even 2 episodes belongs to season 4, so dont download it's rubbish!!!"
[T],Filmofiel,2008-10-10T17:39Z,"The real episode list you can find here:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ALF_episodes"
,RivieraDude,2008-10-11T17:37Z,"Don't be such a hardass Filmofiel, be grateful someone takes the time and effort to upload this at all. There's no use bitching about missing this or that cause Trotyl hasn't ripped this. Simply state what's missing and wrong so those who care knows, I for one is happy to se this furry little 'thing' again no matter what episodes it is.
Picture and sound is great so it's not a useless torrent quality wise.
But thanx for the link to the episode list, that can come in handy when sorting the episodes."
,08tc08,2008-10-13T01:21Z,"why are people bitching and whinning? why does it matter if there are double tracks or if the episodes are out of order? that is a somewhat simple fix on your part. this shit is FREE, if you dont like it, go buy it. take what you can get and QUIT YOUR FUCKING BITCHING!"
,TK-Trooper,2008-10-20T10:54Z,"So glad i found this, is it still being seeded? Hope so! "
,anasur,2008-11-11T06:35Z,"does anyone know where can i find eps 9, 15 and 24 that are missing in here?

if anyone know pleeeeeeeeeeease write here ill be cheking :) "
,Aschlak,2009-01-06T17:37Z,Thank you very much! I'm gonna seed these great 4 torrents a long time! You're my hero!
,bjoernhund,2009-01-29T18:13Z,"Could someone please say which of these 2 episodes are from Season 4?
