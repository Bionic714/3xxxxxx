LIST OF 911 TRUTH WEBSITES: 
(Copied from: http://www.911truth.org/links.php)

    * 9/11 Truther Forum (1933)
      Forum for 9/11 discussion.
    * 9/11 Visibility Project (3702)
      Archive of articles, National Activism, Media Outreach, etc.
    * 911-News.com (29)
      Our Mission at 9/11 News is to facilitate the growing 9/11 Truth movement. We seek to provide a growing database of documents, links, media, and a variety of other sources related to the Movement, as well as a weekly podcast that encapsulates recent and major events in the 9/11 Truth Movement. In this way, we hope to be a sign post in the bustling and rapidly evolving 9/11 Truth Community.
    * 911campusaction.blogspot.com/ (273)
      9/11 Truth: Campus Action Network is a forum for students who are leading university or college 9/11 truth groups. We are interested in sharing ideas, resources and criticisms to help make our campaigns easier, less costly, more effective, and more fun. If you would like to join, contact adam.parrott at gmail.com
    * 911Courage.org (472)
      ESCALATE NOW!
      Translate Courage into Power with Nonviolent Civil Disobedience.
      Calling all 911Truth activists who want to make a real and lasting difference.
      We can set a new record for the most states involved in a coordinated civil disobedience action on the same day.
      THE MEDIA WILL HAVE TO COVER ITS SCALE AND CONTENT.
    * 911EnvironmentalAction (195)
      On television screens the world over, people watched the Twin Towers disintegrate into a fine dust which spread for miles. As the fires burned unabated, New York City residents began to realize that they and the many volunteers who had come to their aid had been exposed to an unprecedented mix of asbestos, fiberglass, lead, mercury, cadmium, dioxins, and hundreds of toxic substances that continue to endanger lives. School parents, residents, safety experts, environmentalists, labor unions, and religious and charitable organizations began to organize to protect themselves and each other, as it became all too obvious that government institutions were misleading or ignoring New Yorkers.

      With the discovery that the federal government had the legal responsibility for investigation and clean up, 9/11 ENVIRONMENTAL ACTION was born. The EPA had abandoned us, hidden the data, and silenced their own ombudsman. We demand a comprehensive remediation of the environmental devastation of our beloved city. Our government must never again fail to take precautionary actions to protect the public health after an environmental disaster. Help in our campaign to make our land a safe place to live!
    * 911Proof (6604)
      Proof that 9/11 was an inside job. Excellent site for newcomers.
    * 911revisited.com (922)
      David Ray Griffin commented, "Here's new video, which probably provides the best case yet of this type for the controlled demolition of the WTC."

      From the website: "When I first set out to make this video it was only going to be so I could show my family & friends the biggest question I have surrounding 9/11. Ever since I decided to upload it, I have been contacted by victims' families, firefighters & police officers (that were there on 9/11), military, doctors, lawyers, engineers, professors, and others thanking me for making it."
    * 911ShareTheTruth (3273)
      Excellent site for educational and visibility resources: DVDs, books, posters, pins, stickers, etc.
    * 911SpeakOut.org (122)
      9/11 does not go away. It is with us on a daily basis. It is the emotional rationale for a long litany of radical changes in US policy:
      * a supposed "War on Terrorism"
      * actual wars in Iraq and Afghanistan
      * possible future wars against a supposed "axis of evil"
      * condoning torture and indefinite detention without any kind of due process
      * scuttling the Geneva conventions
      * the sacrifice of civil liberties at home

      If 9/11 "changed everything," as George W. Bush has said, then it is extremely important that we "get it right." What really happened that day? The administration made a rush to judgment, immediately destroyed much of the evidence, stamped much of the remaining evidence "Secret," and implied that critics were "with the terrorists."

      If all you know is what you have read in the papers or seen on the TV News, you are not fully informed, and you are quite possibly misinformed. We believe you have also been intentionally DIS-informed.

      USA 2006. Directed by Michael Berger
      Director of Photography: John Gannon
      Produced by Connect the Dots LLC
    * Information Clearing House (123)
      This website does not suggest that it contains the "truth". The truth is a combination of all information and all facts relating to a topic. It is therefore unachievable (in my opinion) for anyone to say "I know the truth."

      If you came to this site in search of "the truth" you will be disappointed. That is also true of CNN, FOX , ABC etc. If you came to gather information you may find it a useful resource.

      Gibran says in the "Prophet" Say not, "I have found the truth," but rather, "I have found a truth."

      That brings me to my first point:

      John Adams said "Liberty can not be preserved without general knowledge among people" this statement points to the absolute necessity of an informed citizenry if our nation is to remain a functioning free society.

      This means that each citizen has a civic responsibility to inform himself and share that information with others. The corporate media pumps information into our homes and does a great job of providing the information that our government wants us to know. It has in my opinion become the propaganda arm of government, and a great number of those who call themselves journalists are in fact nothing less than presstitutes.

      Those who wish to inhibit free access to information are in my opinion a great danger to our nation. Why would any adult interfere with the right of fellow citizens to inform themselves?

      There is a war going on for the minds of America, those waging this war are determined to control the American people by taking possession of our minds and by controlling our sources of information.

      Truth is indefinable. Information is unlimited.
    * INN World Report (1537)
      Weekly news program with the best TV coverage of 9/11 issues.

      THE PROJECT FOR THE OLD AMERICAN CENTURY

      This website is a free independent online daily news source that presents and distributes under-reported news items focusing on corporate and government corruption. We make available free of charge all of our archives and do our own research, as well, into conflicts of interest and cronyism.

      The news articles we cover fall into the following categories: government, Iraq, Afghanistan, Central Asia, Haiti, domestic programs, foreign affairs, civil liberties, media, environment, human rights, corporate America, veterans issues, women's issues, depleted uranium studies, the court system, the economy, militarization, church and state, vote fraud, Israel/Palestinian issues, and the war on drugs.

      Aside from maintaining the website we also make available, free of charge, a daily newsletter that contains all of the days headlines for the site with a few extra commentary and human interest stories thrown in. We also make available a monthly newsletter highlighting the top under reported news stories of the month.

      The Project for the OLD American Century is a grass-roots organization that strives to protect and strengthen democracy primarily by disseminating unreported and underreported news stories from a perspective untainted by political or corporate sponsorship.

      The Project was founded in 2002 in response to a rigged election, reduced civil liberties, a hijacking of our domestic and foreign policies by the energy/defense industries, and a compliant corporate media that refused to make these problems prominent in our national consciousness. We felt it our duty as patriots to create a web-based independent media outlet where we can not only debunk the myth of the liberal media but expose the corruption and cronyism taking place at the highest levels of government and corporate power.

      The Project for the Old American Century conducts its own research and compiles dossiers made available to the public both via the web or in print free of charge. Topics include conflicts of interest inside government agencies, specific profiles of top public officials, data acquired through the Freedom of Information Act, and much more.

    * TruthMove.org (418)
      TruthMove is as much about summarizing important information as it is about the theory that progressive intellectuals and activists must be unified around principles that they all share. We realized that all of us are generally invested in discovering important facts, under-reported by mainstream journalists, and presenting them to the public. The environment, the war, surveillance, election fraud, media complicity. social control. There is a rational crossroads between all these concerns where we find that what really matters is that the public learn to care about the fact that they don't know the truth. Motivated by that concern, TruthMove will remind everyone that getting people to think for themselves is more imporant than telling them what to think. As much as we are focused on a popular, accessible approach, making the website a curriculum of sorts, we also hope to remind progressive intellectuals what they all have in common. The truth.

      If you are to frightened to believe your own government could do this, think of how terrifying it would be if you allowed them to get away with it. Find the courage and concern to take the time to at least examine all the factual information and make a decision. If you choose to believe 'whatever happened was probably for the best', then you have failed your country and the ideology on which it was based.

      Serious Questions About The Official Story:
      There are many aspects of the official version of the attacks in New York and Washington, DC on September 11, 2001 that are inconsistent with the huge variety of evidence collected on that day.
      The most disconcerting inconsistencies are these:
      Many aspects of the official story are inconsistent with the laws of physics.
      Many highly qualified, independent experts disagree with the official story.
      Many eyewitness accounts directly contradict the official story.
      Much of the physical evidence does not fit the official story.
      Visual and audio recordings of the events contradict the official story.

      "Still another reason for me, as a Christian theologian, to speak out is that Christianity began as anti-imperial movement; there can be no greater distortion of the original Christian message than the use of Christianity to support imperialism."

      "Accordingly, when I came to the conclusion that the Bush-Cheney administration orchestrated 9/11 in order to promote this empire under the pretext of the so-called war on terror, I decided that I needed to say so by means of summarizing the evidence for this conclusion" (p. vii-viii, Christian Faith and the Truth Behind 9/11).

      Your supply for the truth videos people have been talking about Since always, society has deemed those who believe in conspiracy theories as crazy. I know this because I am one of those ?crazy? conspiracy type people. Whether it is about the 9-11 cover-ups or the existence of a secret government, the vast majority of people could not comprehend how such conspiracies could exist. The time has finally come where these topics are not ?crazy? but actual issues that need to be taking care of. The destiny of our planet will be determined by our generation. As I see it, we (the human race) have two choices: The first choice is to continue living in ignorance and ride this planet and civilization into the ground. The second choice is to become an educated global citizenry by watching the Global Conspiracy Videos with an open mind and sharing the Global Conspiracy Videos with friends and family. Should option one seem the more appealing of the two, than this website is obviously not for you and you may be better served by getting back to your Britney Spears/Brangelina blogs. However, if you are starting to hear people talking about 9-11 truth, the illuminati, the shadow government, new world order, hidden technology, and this staged war on terror then browse this site and find out what all the fuss is about. The truths contained on these videos must become common knowledge in order for our human race to bring about the necessary changes to maintain a healthy existence on this planet. Tell your friends about Global Conspiracy Videos and have fun browsing.

    * Strait Gate Ministries (3)
      Project Strait Gate is an action program started by We Hold These Truths to focus on one of the primary causes of serial wars.

      The inability or unwillingness of some Christian church leaders to act out their God ordained mandate to be peacemakers makes them facilitators for those who make war. The element among us that always opt for conflict as a political mechanism for power is using church leaders to keep serial wars aflame.

      Project Strait Gate takes education directly to the congregation of the church. Learn how you can start your own easy to carry out and effective project with a minimum of time and money. An information package and all needed hand-outs are available. You need only a few banners and signs, and we can show you what to print on them.

      There are few physical limits, only mental ones. Among the first participants were paraplegic in a wheel chair and a 83 year old naturalized American. We have found that as few as three can carry out an effective project at a large church.

      National, celebrity Christians will soon be visited. But first why don?t you start with your neighborhood churches?

      Belief is the most powerful element of culture. It is our beliefs that guide, define, and justify our actions, and it is belief that could very well be our undoing. Though it may be a point of contention for some, to me it seems very clear that we as humans are headed full speed towards disaster. If it is our beliefs that set our course as a society, and if our present course leads to imminent destruction, the logical solution is to change the beliefs of our culture. How on earth would we go about doing such a thing if we were so inclined? (Keeping in mind that the vast majority of the population are in no way interested). . .

      Welcome to the official website of Youth for 9/11 Truth. We are a non-partisan organization consisting of young people who are questioning the official story of the attacks on September 11th, 2001.
The members of this organization have researched the events of the 9/11 attacks, and agree that the government is hiding information and ultimately the truth of what happened that day.
This organization was founded by Ethan Stroschein, webmaster and editor of The 9/11 Files, who has researched and has came to the conclusion that the United States government not only let the attacks happen, they made it happen.
