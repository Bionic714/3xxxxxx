,Peaknik,2006-12-02T14:45Z,"Good work. 
Thanks for helping the truth to be known."
,tomtomx,2006-12-02T17:56Z,For all you REAL truth seekers out there. Don't miss Loose Change v.3 with corrections on most of the stupidities in the first two versions (and lots of the weird claims by the 911 conspiracists). Grab it fo direct download at: http://www.lolloosechange.co.nr/
,Peaknik,2006-12-02T23:59Z,"OK. I started watching this so called ""3rd version"" which is basivcally loosechange with some guy who overlays his own comments. 
I admit, I haven't watched the whole thing yet, but so far that movie hasn't debunked anything.  It is just comments, which easily could be counter argued.  I may change my mind once I watched the whole thing, but up til now it has just been stupid. 

i.e. how it begins.  Loosechange 2nd ver. 
-Why does truth need a second version. 
--Easy it is a film and such can be edited to include/exclude material to make it faster, more interesting etc. furthermore, the filmmaker may have got his hands on ne information. 
Infact, a film such as this SHOULD be revised as information emerges.

-Operation Nortwood no link to 911. The gov refused to go ahead with this false op operation. No people were supposed to die.
-- This shows to people who didn't believe it, that the gov is involved in false flag ops. 
Secondly, it ties people involved in previous false flag operations to 
Furthermore it shows the nature of the operations. That was back in the early 60s. Just because THAT gov didn't want to go ahead, doesn't mean that a different, more extreme, government would not.  Evidence is now also emerging that people were sacrificed in pearl harbour to justify US entry into WW2.  (Although I agree this is not proven yet)
It is however clear that governments around the world do sacrifice their own people if they think it is justified.  Is US somewhere abover all the other governments?  How come then it has been such an eager player fuealing coups, rebellions, deatsh squads elsewhere. How come it could sacrifice 3000+ own soldiers + 650000+ iraqi lives for a war based on lies.  (Same number US casualties as 911, without a blinking). 

Answer - they think it is justifiable.  
Imagine for instance that the worlds oil/gas supplies are tightening up because of 1) geopolitical tension 2) peaking of extraction of conventional carbonhydrates.
This could easily lead to a world economy smashed into pieces, stop of imports/exports, stop to travel, a bancrupt airlines and plane builders, no transportation of food, extremely costly food production etc.   
Could a government sacrifice a few thousand lives to justify invasion of the oil richest region of the world to SAVE their own (300 000 000) people from the worst effects of this?

Further; Bin Laden family is Saudi Arabian. 
Saudi political stability is only secured by political stability in the country. 
US and Saudi work hand-in-hand. US supports the house of Saud and ensure stabiliy. Saudi ensures oil keeps flowing. And has even in the past pledged to flood the market with cheap oil for amongst other the re-election of Bush Jr.  (Did you notice how the oil prices also dropped for the mid-term election despite all the OPEC talk about cutting back 1mil bbl/day?)
Bin Laden and Bush family are in business together.  US worked with the talibans to throw our Soviet from Afghanistan. Osama Bin Laden works with the talibans. Bin Ladens were the only ones allowed to fly out of US directly after 911 - no questions asked, no interrigations. 
Majority of the named hijakers were Saudi.

If Saudi oil production is peaking (read twilight in the desert by mathew simmons - energy fund)
this has a real chance of throwing the country into chaos and the overthrow of the house of Saud.  Would they therefore be willing to assist US in ensuring their own safety by having US military precence in the region?

Sad to see, but most people have been so shaped into consumerism and tv watching that they can't even comprehend these ype of scenarios. 

If you are intesrested, check out peakoil.com and peakoil.net  it may give you a new perspective on things.

The documentary is not perfect but is an evolving project which many would seek to debunk to make sure it doesn't hit the cinemas.

,p2P2p,2006-12-07T14:03Z,"I did watch he first few mins of that video and it was quite poor in ITS ""weird arguing"" and I pretty much came to the same conclusions as Peaknik above (though I disagree about peak oil). Yes, I have also watched ""Screw Loose Change"" and thought that was an equal waste of my time. As I have already said LC2 is still a work in progress, started from very humble beginnings by some students and a few years later it has been seen by millions - it still remains one of the best initial videos to wake people up - it is popular - get over it. This torrent is not just about LC2 though, it contains footage of other 911 Protests 2006.

,RiTarDid,2007-02-05T10:09Z,"I agree with Peanik and others, the comments in this video only provide spins, they don't disprove the facts. eg) the captions try to justify the 1962 drone aircraft fake because it doesn't have anthing to do with 9/11?  hello, the video just  proved that the american government would fake terrorism to start a war!  It only supports the evidence, proving that this kind of activity is not new.  Also, the captions make a lot of humdrum about how the first few minutes go by without mention of 9/11, but ignore the evidence that is presented in the video.  The guy who created ""screw loose change"" is clearly not a person of facts, they are a person trying to defend a phony war because they're too chickenshit to stand up to their own leaders.  Open your mind, think for yourself and the evidence will support itself...believe that before you believe what people like tomtomx have to say."
,RiTarDid,2007-02-05T10:30Z,"Furhtermore, the more i watch ""screw loose change"" the more i am convinced that it is nothing more than propoganda originating from inside the government to support further security (imprisonment of innocents) inside the u.s.
The person behind ""screw loose change"" is a liar, playing devil's advocate to make himself feel smart and most likely getting paid on the side for his efforts."

More conspiracy theory bullshit..........

lets break out the tin foil hats and copies of Catcher in the Rye
"
,youngidealist,2007-10-03T20:36Z,"Poisonfist, just cause it's a conspiracy theory doesn't make it bullshit. While it sickens me to know clearly that there are many people out there toting alien stories, conspiracy theories and religion just for hype and DONATIONS, getting angry at every claim just turns our politicians into our new prophets. Can you honestly say that there is no wrongdoing in the government? It's because it's so obvious that there is a lot wrong with the system that conspiracy theories are gaining such credibility. Step back and consider what you would want to say if some truth about these conspiracies is true and passes you by. It isn't bullshit that OJ murdered two people, it isn't bullshit that lobbyists for corporate media brought about the digital millennium act by finding some magical means (probably bribery) of convincing the senate to pass it without any consideration for what the people would want, and it isn't bullshit that Bush is an incompetent leader (much like Regan) who only differs from the mentally handicapped by a slight lack in excess drooling when he speaks. Oh yeah, and it isn't bullshit that the American Government had plenty of experience with airplane hijackings to have prevented this or at least given several clear reasons why they were unable to, rather than just incompetent.

At the end of the day, all of these conspiracy claims are just a question of that; are we being lead by incompetents or masterminds who think that we are that incompetent as a society. You don't need to listen to or agree with every theory to know that there is something to be known. If you don't want to research it yourself, then quit nagging at these people who did their own research and made their own answers. As with all things, you can believe whatever you want, but you don't get to stop talking about it just because of some aimless taboo that you want to perpetuate. "
,snothas,2007-10-27T01:07Z,crikey...! All out of tin foil :/
,sabotsabot,2007-11-09T04:35Z,"(shakes his head in disapproving disbelief.)

in one corner the 911 truthers are aligned.
(to be fair, while i disagree with both sides of this argument; i would stand firmly NEXT TO the 911 truth guys,.. even as i strongly disagree.) (i will try however, to suppose another kind of skepticism)
what i find unfortunate, and yes.. here i agree with chomsky, ward churchill, etc.. is the single-issue rants that truthers offer... they are trying to convice me (and millions of other left radicals,) that old white men in fancy clothes are the most brutal violent threat we all face in terms of our security?  all i have to say to that is ""welcome"" to the party. we need little convincing on this matter. (though we would all argue that it is NOT because they are old, or white, or men... this is a culture of violence that has developed over 4 thousand or so years.)  what baffles me however,.. is the weight you lend to this one solitary TINY act, 9-11... it doesnt seem very 'skeptical', though truthers want to be seen as trailblazing muckrakers, to NOT recognize the MUCH MORE BRUTAL acts these same actors have participated in throughout recent history. 3000 ""innocent"" victims? (first of all, many of them were hardly 'innocent') So where was your probing skeptical analysis, when is was 3 million slaughtered in vietnam? 2 or 3 million slaughtered in korea?,.. how many millions in the 'middle passage'? also as many as 14 million indigenous from right here? (all of the lower 48 states had, at one time or another, scalp bounties,.. these bounties included a bounty paid even for the scalps of indigenous fetuses. and now the millions slaughtered in iraq,.. dispossessed, occupied.

and if i followed your arguments that these old white men planned and implemented the 9-11 attacks..( which i do not.).. but if i did,.. this would just be the newest, and in contrast the most minute moment of violence in the long deep list of their brutal atrocities. 

so much of the air in your rant is the idea that this would mean some sort of deviation from the norm if a government were to intend harm to its people.  no government ever meant anything but harm to its general population.  shocking, that this one would take out a few thousand business men. 

this seems like a delusion also worthy of your skepticism.. why do these same truthers 'believe' in such intellectual contraptions as 'nation-states' or ' borders' or state protection of private property (the republican form, advocated by both factions of the war/business party.. the democrats and the republicans..)

there are limits to our solidarity when truthers fail to recognize the tiny scale of this particular atrocity,.. we wonder if you all would still be daydreaming and masturbating if these same old white guys were still killing brown and yellow and black and red people by the millions... what if 'they' had never attacked your' 3000 ""innocents""?  

and then the other side of this argument?  SO MUCH MORE PATHETIC!   really?  like that 'debunking' film,.. seems like the sort of thing that would come right out of the cia or fbi. (and film-maker, that is no compliment, dissemble your illusions.)
and 'little green footballs' for fucks sake? fucking nazis.

sycophants,.. squealing and slurping at the nipples of militaristic entrenched power. sad.
and remember these conservatives are the ones who we are to believe are the 'rugged individuals''.. tools or monsters... or both.

truthers,.. i would respectfully request that you stay JUST as aware, JUST as skeptical.. but back the hell up.. back up to where you can see 3000 years or so splayed out... lose your erection for powerful leaders... and likewise for the soft fuzzy patriotic history.  if you are a simple working person and you still suffer the delusion that 'the founders"" had your interests at heart, your security at heart..  and it has only recently gotten out of hand, piss off. you and the little green footballs guy are spawn of the same gullible american 'patriotic' education. 

nobody seems skeptical or critical here"
,Crawling_Chaos007,2008-02-02T06:42Z,"I cannot believe some people believe shit like this. If your one that believes our own government conspired to make 911 happen you are blind beyond imagination and in my opinion need a lobotomy.
All this bullshit has been disproved beyond a shadow of a doubt anyway by the REAL experts. 
A good movie to watch is ""Screw Loose Change"". There are other things to look up for yourself if you believe this CRAP.
True and factual things which totally destroy ANY argument these 911 conspiracy nutters can come up with. Don't be blind sheep listening only to one side a side that has no basis in fact or truth of ANY kind.
