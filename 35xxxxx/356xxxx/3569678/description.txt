An Audience with.... Take That

Shown on ITV (UK) 2/12/2006

ripped from DVB-T, adverts removed and compressed to XVID

Note: it is somewhat large for a 48min show, it was originally recorded for a friend and I have posted it here if anyone else wants it.

Coming soon:
Ultimate Take That - Live Concert

Let me know if you have any preference in format for the concert. (About 75mins long). It will be posted once this one has a couple of seeders.
