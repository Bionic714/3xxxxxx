Twitch Remix Service was established in July of 1991 by Jim Hopkins, Mike Wertheim and Randall Erkelens. The label released edits, remixes and original material that catered to the underground dj. Each issue was a 2-record set containing the best tracks of the month. Twitch released 14 vinyl issues, 10 cd compilations, 3 dj loop tools EPs and various original 12" releases including the chart topper "Trip Harder" by The Ultraviolet Catrastrophe. 

In July of 1995, they discontinued the remix service series and started to release 12" singles and a series entitled "San Francisco Sound Spectrum" a compilation that focuses on the best underground dance music being produced in San Francisco.
