I found it easy to get going - mount the image, install, copy the crack into the game directory. I ignored the SPTD file - it appears to be an update for the security protection system, but maybe you'll need it if you have problems (?).

No, there are no widescreen resolutions, but either Win7 or my monitor or even the game itself stretched the image automatically, and it really does not look bad at all. The game also auto-detected my X-Box pad, so no worries there.

The graphics are a bit soft, not like the crisp visuals of the VT series, but the AI is good and the tennis overall is well presented and offers a good match. 

Custom player creation is also very detailed, but only a limited number of countries to choose from - no Poland! :(

Definitely one to buy if you see it on budget. Just a shame they didn't carry on the series on PC.
