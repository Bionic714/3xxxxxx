1.0 or 1.01? with crack or no crack?"
,tesam,2006-11-22T20:03Z,cover?
,micleg,2006-11-22T23:28Z,"Yes, could someone who has downloaded it (60 now) tell the rest of us what it contains since the description really sucks."
,andii,2006-11-23T09:59Z,"Well, it's very easy to just download the NFO file and get all the info you need. 

This is the 1.0 version with crack.

No cover included."
,krocs,2006-11-24T19:56Z,"DO NOT TRY TO PATCH THIS ONE TO  1.01
IÂ´m sure you'll crash and burn
WonÂ´t work"
,thol,2006-11-25T11:36Z,"My deamon says:Unable to mount image. File command must appear before any other commands.
Anyone know how to do??"
,andii,2006-11-26T21:14Z,"@chief007
Sure there is a crack. Mount the .bin and then look in the folder ingeniously named ""Crack"". I promise you that you will find the cracked .exe ;) I did anyway."

,Logan X,2006-12-09T16:04Z,"Is there any difference between this Sid.Meiers.Railroads-RELOADED and the other one?
Because the size is different.
Also I downloaded the other one, copied the crack over and when I run it, it restarts my PC.
Any help? Thanks"
,Logan X,2006-12-13T17:09Z,"Can someone please help. When I try to run this my PC restarts this has happened with other games, such as Ceasar IV and with games that have previously worked like The Godfather. What is going on? Thanks."
,s_haug,2006-12-14T21:47Z,"i can't play the game.
it pops up wrong disc inserted. please insert the original ""Railroads"" CD/DVD. please have a look at www.securom.com"
,s_haug,2006-12-14T21:47Z,any one help me please ;D
,maskedavenger,2006-12-15T02:12Z,"The DEAL:

Like already said, the cue file is messed up  VTools wouldn't mount it so I converted it to an ISO (using WinISO) and mounted it that way.  The game works until there is a lot going on.  Then it increasingly slows down.

The 1.01 patch fixes the bugs, BUT!  You can't successfully get around Securom with this release, so download a blindwrite release and don't bother with this one unless someone can offer a solution."
,erik90,2007-02-03T12:08Z,"where shall i put the crack.
witch folder ?"
,maskedavenger,2007-05-22T19:28Z,"listen up!  The cue file is messed up.  You can't mount with it.  Very easy fix, open the cue file in notepad and delete all the text and put this in it's place:

FILE ""rld-rail.BIN"" BINARY
TRACK 01 MODE1/2352
INDEX 01 00:00:00 

Save it and mount with Daemon Tools and you're all set!"
