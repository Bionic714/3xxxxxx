File dMC-r11.5-Registered.exe contains spyware (keylogger) Win32:Ardamax-gen."
,zeek2freak,2007-01-03T20:56Z,the adware inside of that executable file is very minor and if you have a decent firewall program just block it and your computer will be secure...this program is working great converting my flac files to mp3!
,svejkcz11,2007-03-31T16:55Z,"just block, why not crack the thing  and then delete the adware you fool..I didn't find no adware keylooger, I think you need to learn more before you shoot your mouth off!"
