,roddisII,2006-11-26T15:55Z,How does Keygen work? Is it just to click on generate until Nero starts innstalling?
,iegorshkov,2006-11-26T19:32Z,"4 files reported as corrupted upon extraction/install; also, keygen does contain the trojan."

,MTField,2006-12-07T08:56Z,"I've D/L many many versions of NERO over the years and NEVER found a version without some nasty BS contained within it. I can only assume that Ahead pay coders to write this shit....That said, the pen is sometimes mightier than the sword so here we go...

This torrent contains the Poison Ivy trojan (Nasty mofo undetetected by 99% of current A/V A/T software including NOD32, Antivir, F-Secure, Norton etc.

It's essentially a keylogger. CC Stealer etc. 
It's obvious you have it if you have a permanent instance of Firefox.exe or IE.exe (whatever your default browser is) running in the background which just refused to close. It's not too difficult to get rid of but it's too long winded to type here.

,MTField,2006-12-07T09:08Z,"I should of added that this trojan does ""exactly what it says on the tin"" and there's already been a spate of reports of bank accounts, paypal accounts been used without the owners consent or knowledge, so you'd be well advised to change all your passwords as soon as you've removed the trojan from the system 32 folder.
