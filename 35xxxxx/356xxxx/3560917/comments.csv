Thats kinda like painting over someone elses painting....GET A LIFE!"
,nerull69,2006-11-20T07:11Z,"Ya, this fan edit shit is a HUGE waste of time.  Granted theres lots of scenes in movies that I could do without, but as I did not make the movie, I live with them.

Instead of sampling someone elses work, why not make your own friggin movie the way you want it.  

 I will just use the fast forward or skip scene button.

This shit makes you guys look like Vanilla Ice."
,sealjo,2006-11-20T16:24Z,"In many cases the edit that is released isn't the version that the director wanted to create. It's a compromise between his vision, what test audiences liked and what the studio wants. Especially when it comes to endings and how loing the movie is.

Instead of bashing fan edits, why not watch a few of them? Ep 1 of Star Wars left most viewers wishing they hadn't set foot in the theatre, most fan edits make it ok. "
,LEGOLANDMAN,2006-11-21T02:13Z,"Thats why there is ""DIRECTOR'S CUT"" versions :O"
,nerull69,2006-11-21T03:34Z,I have watched a few fan edits.  Thats why I posted.  I agree with LEGO.  People who do these edits need to go get a job.
,davin8r,2006-11-23T11:57Z,"The author is claiming this as his own original work....that's why it's called a ""fan edit"" for thos of you who apparently can't read.  Nobody's asking you whiners to download this.  Instead of crying about it and insulting the author, just don't download it if you think it's a waste of time.  Ungrateful little assholes."
,davin8r,2006-11-23T11:58Z,"edit:  first sentence should read, ""The author is *not* claiming this as his own original work"""
,nerull69,2006-11-24T17:47Z,"Silence !

When I want your opinion davin8r, I will give it to you!.   ""Fan"" edits are for fat highschoolers!"
,bloodstainer,2006-11-29T18:19Z,"how can u say first that they 
should geta job n the say there 
highschool stutents??"
,bungditin,2007-09-09T12:13Z,"The soundtrack is quiet (about 10dB less than usual) and encoded in AC3 (2ch @ 192kbps). Note that it's quite possible to retrieve the 5.1 audio (using a plugin like 'fsurround' in Foobar2k), but you would have to go over the DVD5 limit for it to be worthwhile. If you're having trouble getting a working disc, use a tool like FixVTS to clean up any redundancy or anything that could confuse your DVD player. I really enjoyed this edit, given how robbed I felt when leaving the cinema the first time..!"
,AWFChris,2008-05-17T10:57Z,"Blaksvn, why not just make a Star Wars Fan Film instead of editing what George Lucas created? I have watched all of the fan films I could find that were actually judged by Lucas himself and he even thought that some of them were very  entertaining but I doubt he would appreciate someone editing his work as the time and effort that he devoted to completing the 3rd and final movie in the 6 pack actually seems insulting to be edited by a hobbiest like yourself. BTW, I did not download this nor will I......"

,Gu357,2009-10-03T13:53Z,"Can someone please seed?
Thank you"
,phallica2000,2010-10-25T01:13Z,"Why mess with somebody else's work....because he fucking can? Is that really a problem for all you sad bastards commenting on this torrent?
Get a life, download the original (and shitter) film if you want to, but don't rip on somebody who's spent a lot of his own time and effort creating a fundamentally better version of the film for TRUE fans.
Go on, get the fuck out of here."
,ElizabethFrowns,2011-05-08T00:01Z,"I dont see why people get bent out of shape over ""Fan Edits""...if you go to a bar and listen to any local band on a Friday or Saturday they are ""covering"" someone else's original songs/material...A Fan Edit is the same process. It's actually a compliment to Lucas that people car about the StarWars world so much that they want to do a Fan Edit. Think of it as a ""Cover Edits"" instead of a ""Cover Songs""...same thing"
