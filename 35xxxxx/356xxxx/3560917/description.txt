We would like to state that this particular NOT FOR PROFIT fan created film

not support piracy, you must own/purchase an official DVD to protect your 
license. This DVD should be freely distributed via trade or download among 
legitimate owners of the official DVD and never sold for profit.

*** JUST WHAT IS THIS TORRENT? ***
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Some folks seem to think that my NFO\'s are a bit vague, so here is the lowdown 
on this DVD. It\'s a fan edit of Star Wars Episode Three. 


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*** FEATURED FAN EDITED FILM ***
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


STAR WARS
Episode III: Fall of the Republic

The Galactic Republic is crumbling under attacks by Count Dooku, the ruthless 
Sith Lord. War ravages the galaxy, with no end in sight. In a daring move, 
General Grievous, the cyborg leader of the Separatist droid army, has swept into 
Coruscant and kidnapped Chancellor Palpatine, leader of the Galactic Senate. As 
the Separatists attempt to flee with their valuable hostage, two Jedi Knights 
lead a desperate mission to rescue the captive Chancellor...

This fan edit of George Lucas\'s third and final Star Wars prequel offers a 
streamlined take on Anakin Skywalker\'s fall from grace, and the subsequent birth 
of Darth Vader.  Notable changes include an abridged rescue of the Chancellor 
aboard General Grievous\'s ship, edits to all scenes involving Anakin and Padme 
including the complete excision of their balcony scene, the removal of redundant 
or unnecessary dialogue in an effort to increase momentum, and the jettisoning 
of the medical droid\'s \'will to live\' explanation.  

Few scenes have been left untouched.  

Special thanks to the crew at originaltrilogy.com, Rikter, and especially my 
friends for their interest in the project. 

And to my dad for instilling in me a frighteningly single-minded love for Star 
Wars.

efforts, Fan created Edits, OUT-OF-PRINT titles or titles that are not YET 
available on any \"Official\" currently produced DVD, Laserdisc or VHS release. We 
will not offer any titles that are copies of available \"Official\" DVD\'s via

these titles when possible (i.e. Laserdisc, VHS, CED or DVD) 

Information in any torrent posted by Blaksvn-Torrentz that is NOT 100% accurate 
will be corrected. I will update that information with what I believe is the 
correct information when it is passed on to me. I will ALWAYS give the proper

SO, if I post a torrent and I have NO information about said torrent - I will

known title or name, I will again place a temporary name on the set until a 
correct name can be established. - I will no longer use any information gathered 
from any forums or newsgroups as this information will be considered strictly 
hearsay (unless the information is posted by the KNOWN source then it can be 
called canon). Again I will ALWAYS try to give the proper credit but this is 
only possible when I have this information.

ALL Personal information (i.e. emails, names, dates and places) will ALWAYS
