,Sargent_D,2006-11-26T16:52Z,It is NOT your country too.
,rimad_,2006-11-26T17:37Z,oh it is.
,Hasnain,2006-11-27T19:33Z,"You ignorant ass, It's not even the native American's country either. Keep your racism restricted to U.K., Germany or elsewhere in Europe but the America's are all the land of migrants and try not to judge before knowing something, you more than often end up making a fool of yourself.

As for this video it explains how Muslims have been suffering in the U.S. thanks to the bad impression people like Osama and biased media groups like Foxnews have provided. 

It's your choice to be a racist, prejudice ass but if you're gonna say something know some facts.

,Lensman,2006-11-29T18:37Z,ermm how can you be racist against a religion?
,greybigtop,2006-12-13T15:39Z,"You canÂ´t, but today ""racist"" merely means not politically correct.
Islam is of course complete nonsense and muslims are brainwashed idiots.
ALL religions are merely manmade fairytales created by morons in order to control retards."
,ZenFerret,2006-12-17T10:14Z,"NO ISLAM IN AMERICA.  Sorry camel boy, we're a little too smart for that.  ""If you want money for people with minds that hate - all I can tell you is brother you have to wait!"""
,Bendico,2007-03-18T13:44Z,"""Islam is the fastest growing religion"" is that like every Muslim's punchline? 

Then we'll make sure to minimise your numbers."
,socratus,2007-08-14T22:53Z,"stupidness - not asking questions, talking without knowledge, making accusations without proof and offcourse making STUPID STATEMENTS. Ask yourself: ""Am I stupid?""

,Razorbladesoup,2008-01-05T00:16Z,"yea but native americans were here FIRST
sooo all you white devils can get outa my country! :)

and anyone that voted for bush should be banished henceforth anyway"
,rockstar11998,2008-07-01T19:32Z,"rimad and Hasnain - Never will America be your country too.  You live here but according to Islam you cannot be bothered by borders because you want the whole world to be Muslim.  The only nation you want to be a part of is a Muslim one.  You may like the liberties this country has but you don't want to follow all of the laws of this nation.  By saying you are Muslim you are a supporter of Terrorism if you truly know and understand the full history of Islam.
You are the ignorant one if you think we will share our country with the likes of Terrorist ideals.  That bad impression you speak of comes directly from the Koran - Osama read directly from the Koran how to treat non-believers and today Mosques all around the Middle East and Europe are teaching those same things.  So don't try to justify the your religion because you can't.  Satan will not uphold you in the end.  There will be a great slaughter during Armageddon."
