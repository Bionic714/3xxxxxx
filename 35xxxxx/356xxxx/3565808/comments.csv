,zzirhp,2012-08-09T02:03Z,"This DVD is a complete mess, run it through PgcEdit and you'll know what I mean.

I got it cleaned up and playing but it took some work. 

In Nero 6.6.0.8 (old, yea, but works), using the original files in the torrent, the movie is over-sized and fails verification. It will write 100%, but verify flops every time at the end.

Maybe it's just my setup, but I think for most of the ppl on this site who are fuckin clueless about pretty much everything in general will be pissing & moaning about it not working right.

Open the original files in DVDShrink, untick any languages you don't need & let DVDShrink re-do the DVD layout WITHOUT the extra languages, therefore reducing overall size and thus you should be able to burn/verify without issue.

I recommend aiming for 4.36GB sized DVD5's instead of 4.37GB to avoid problems mentioned above. Don't get me wrong, this is totally usable it's just not user-friendly.

Anyway, thanks for the upload & effort jfmrey"
