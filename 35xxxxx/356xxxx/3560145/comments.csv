,KG(KingGeorge),2009-08-02T10:30Z,"I watched this last night. We finished it, but the quality was the poorest I ever had:
- image sometimes is blurrish
- french audio added, but the movie is in english originally
- sound: french audio has bad quality; too much bass. Sound effect are ok though.

My advice: download another torrent (f.e. the aXXo torrent) and add the subs yourself from ondertitel.com"
