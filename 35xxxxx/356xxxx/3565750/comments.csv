Thx again, Tedsharer!"

Thanks again"

,bigflavor,2006-11-29T02:55Z,"SEASON 6 hasn't started yet!  DAMN IT!  Season 5 is 21 episodes, for which only episode 7 has aired.  So this is S05E07.

Label it correctly mother fuckers!"
[T],Tedsharer,2006-12-05T22:21Z,The scene mislabels it and if we should start labelling them S05 then there would be a lot of confusion. So shut up and be happy that I uploaded this.
