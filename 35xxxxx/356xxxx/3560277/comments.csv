,frankute,2006-11-19T04:21Z,Thank you for bringing this to us.
,Osaka,2006-11-19T04:40Z,Is there any real difference between this one and: http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3530816/ ..?
,kongdvd,2006-11-19T16:55Z,"I have been trying to download http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3530816/ but it never completed, so I don't know what's on it. But I believe it is the same content as mine, 113 mins + 66 mins extras. Alex on his radioshow asks his audience to go get either one release, but he has not said anything about any difference between the two releases, apart from that the cover art is a bit different. 

What I know is that the Symposium Edition of TerrorStorm is a little bit different in content. 

My DVD is uncompressed at 7,22GB."
,kongdvd,2006-11-19T17:03Z,"PS! The release date on Amazon for this DVD was October 31, 2006"
,kongdvd,2006-11-19T17:11Z,"I find that some danes have been busy subtitling one version of the film. Go to www.terrorstorm.dk to get DVD with danish subtitles. Non-profit, good prices. 

Great initiative!"

If you are reading this text then STOP, and download Terrorstorm instead..!

...zzz... bah!"
