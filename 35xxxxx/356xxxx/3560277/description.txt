TerrorStorm - A History of Government Sponsored Terrorism (2006)
Alex Jones

The terrorists are not who you think they are.

A movie everyone on the planet must see! Alex Jones is the real thing. 

This is the full DVD w/extras now sold at Amazon. Read excellent reviews here:

NTSC

Running time: Movie 113 mins, Extras 66 mins. 

No subtitles. 

DVD9 shrinked with CloneDVD2 to fit DVD5. Quality is still great.

Alex Jones encourages everyone to copy and spread his films, but support him by buying this and other materials by the dozens directly from www.infowars.com

Listen to his radioshow for three hours every day at http://www.nfowars.net:443/stream1.pls

REQUEST: I would love to have subtitles for this DVD, the movie including the extras. Preferrably in norwegian, but swedish or danish would be good too. The subtitles would be great for spreading the truth to a wider audience.

Keep on fighting, truthers.
