,splammo,2006-12-20T05:59Z,"There is a file included in this torrent apologizing for downloading the show and for not paying for it.

However, there is no need to be sorry.  What has been made available here is unavailable anywhere else.  I have looked for a DVD set for the colbert report and was unable to find one. "
