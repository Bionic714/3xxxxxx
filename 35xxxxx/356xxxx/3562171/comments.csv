,Haarvest,2006-11-22T01:33Z,"I have the .iso of this release, and it just contains some language folders with what I assume are self-extracting executables of the addons. However, in my case, doubleclicking does nothing.

How do you install the mods with this repack?"
,scaramonga,2006-11-22T01:36Z,I have made the setup file to run when disk inserted.....so all will install just fine :)
,Halbermunken,2006-11-22T01:36Z,"Double clicking works for me, however I don't get any new mission information once I had installed (and made sure it was actived) this Knights of the Nine mission.
Hope I don't have to restart the game..."
,Halbermunken,2006-11-22T01:37Z,"Just to add more information. I didn't have the Oblivion disc in the drive when I installed this.
Game is of course patched plus of course no-dvd crack is used..."
,yobro03,2006-11-22T03:32Z,Halbermunken: I heard that you have to do the main quest then go to the temple in the imperial city and someone will speak to you in a grey hood
,YesThor,2006-11-22T13:52Z,go to Anvil and talk to Pilgrame infront a church beside the manor and you start the new addon.
,warri-,2006-11-23T10:07Z,"Hey Bro at first i couldnt get this to work but its all good i unziped it with 7z442-x64 to a folder on my desktop and clicked on each setup file in the folder.
 Started my Oblivion savegave and it add all the Quest thanks for the download. 
ps the .exe cd thing didnt work for me but frees free right :-)"
,Metal_Micke,2006-11-23T19:37Z,"Is it just me or are you only able to ask the three priests at the shrine of kynareth about ""rumours""? This unables me to continue the story =/"
,YesThor,2006-11-23T21:27Z,i also have problem with the priestes and here i cant go on with the story becouse for the mace you need the boots.
,YesThor,2006-11-23T21:28Z,maybe that why the official is not out jet.
,Metal_Micke,2006-11-24T17:59Z,I found out how to solve it: You gotta download OBMM and change the load order of the mods so knights of the nine load last. Then you need to load a savegame where you havent talked to the priests because otherwise it wont work.
,PolishEagle,2006-11-25T17:55Z,"I got this problem, that Oblivion crashes at loading, and since i like these plugins I use them all. And it crashes more often. I couldn't find anything anywhere else. It's mostly at the fast travel, loading lands when travelling. But not so much at going indoor/outdoor."
,PolishEagle,2006-11-25T22:33Z,I think it's because ther's summin wrong with my hardware/software and it conflicts with HDR. But the Shield of the Nine looks so small. Like a pan.
,Henkect,2006-12-02T09:11Z,do i have to have Oblivion in order to play this game?
,the seal giver,2006-12-09T02:02Z,"i got a problem when i try to open the file...
it says "" the archive is either unknown or damaged "" what shall i do?"
,victor92,2006-12-11T16:16Z,"who should i talk to to start the addon i just started im at the temple were the blades are in the begining after finding the emperors son,"
,creativeone,2006-12-11T17:10Z,Keep seeding!!
,Amandax22,2006-12-31T06:40Z,"Thanks so much for this. I'm going a bit slow right now. 30-40kB/s >_<

But nonetheless, this sounds great."
,olaut,2007-01-13T15:45Z,missing or invalid registry/INI entry?
,fnog,2007-01-21T01:12Z,"HEY ASSWHOLE!

How about actually getting the REAL DLC file and the REAL .BSA file and THEN seeding it!


I am sick of all these people claimming to have the real thing and it ends up being packet in some odd manner or damaged beyond repair."
,the blackmamba,2007-02-28T20:09Z,"Hey is this an addon for The Elder Scrolls of oblivion IV or is it a whole new game, just wondering, downloading it anyway, I hope this's'nt some virus infected shit cause then I'll kick your ass, you feel me?"
,ZZ Cracker ZZ,2007-05-11T07:18Z,"PLz seed!!! seeing 10 peers, 1 seed.. goin on 1kb/s :S"
,BardoftheOzarks,2007-06-04T18:37Z,"Okay, I don't know about anyone else, but when I try to install this, it just quits responding. I've tried it with and without the CD."
,DaRkMiLlEnIuM,2007-08-15T02:04Z,!WARNING! DO NOT download this because i just got a email saying bethesda filed a copyright complaint against my IP. !WARNING!
,webdevour,2008-03-01T21:11Z,"Jesus fucking christ, a .7z file?  Just that fact alone makes me want to download the 1GB+ all language release over this shitty torrent.  Why on God's green Earth can't you just use a .rar or even a Self-Extracting.exe?"
,Zirex,2008-05-19T19:03Z,"If you have problems to run the executables, rename them first."
,chocolatechar,2009-07-03T02:30Z,"I'm downloading... not going slow at all... 100 kb/s!!
