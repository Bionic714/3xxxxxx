,spannerz1,2006-11-26T06:46Z,"DON'T BOTHER DOWNLOADING THIS FILE, IT DOESNT WORK"
,Supremus,2006-11-26T16:49Z,Just because YOU can't get the file to work does NOT mean the file does not work. You simply don't have the proper codecs installed.
,MCMJ,2006-11-28T22:54Z,ok well is it a dvd rip.. nice quality... u gotta love how one guy says it dosnt work then nobody else downloads.. or hesitates.. like I am right now.. hmmmm should I download or not.. lol does it have sample inside??????
,judoka_pl,2006-11-30T05:15Z,"Hey I just wtatched that and it's a decent quality definetly a dvd rip, so just like the Supremus already said just because you can't watch it doesn't mean it's bad "
,gary_currington,2006-12-03T04:50Z,i am downloading it now...will it work with vlc.
,frogs_snails,2006-12-03T08:47Z,"spannerz1 use k-lite codec or something, fuck why don't people ask a question instead of dishin' out flak"

,xauxauxau,2006-12-09T17:31Z,Quality is not good.. watchable but not good.
,brede90,2006-12-09T18:14Z,it doesn't work? haha what an idiot.. it works perfectly 
,xauxauxau,2006-12-10T13:01Z,"i correct my self:
it is definately worth downloading.. 700 mb for 2 hours of film makes it decent quality..

Howcome Axxos eng. subtitles fit this movie perfectly? www.subscene.com"
