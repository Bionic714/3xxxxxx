Ingnis started in october 2003 by guitarist Emil Andersson 
and drummer Oscar Nilsson, rehearsing on a small scale in their local environment. 
Very shortly afterwards Magnus Svärd joined in as a second guitarist, 
and vocalist Anders Tangen came in, taking care of the different growls. 
Still in search of a bass player, they convinced old friend Ragnar Hedtjärn 
to pick up the bass-axe, and thus the setting was complete for the first time.

After a short while of rehearsing and doing gigs, the band decided to 
kick out Anders, due to several personal reasons. 
Now in search for a new singer, they instead found a female one, Eva Hillerström, who was complimented by Petter Melander, taking care of the harsher side of the vocal duties.
Eva\\\\\\\'s time with the group only lasted a short while, however, and soon left, 
leaving Petter as the only remaining vocalist.

By 2004, they had entered some local music competitions but didn\\\\\\\'t 
get through to the finals. In the end, Petter felt that he was not 
motivated enough to continue with the band, and decided to quit. 
Ingnis was once again without a vocalist, and turned to David Olgarsson, 
who had gone to the same school as Ragnar and also played in the same 
band for a short while.

After some more gigs with the new line-up, they went in and recorded their first demo, \\\\\\\"42\\\\\\\" in may 2004. Even though it felt like an impressive feat at the time, the novelty of having a recorded demo quickly faded away, and was replaced by an itch to record a new and better representation of their sound.

So, during may/june 2005, a couple of gigs richer, a hell of a lot better, 
and maybe not too much wiser, they went ahead and recorded a new demo at Centrumvillan, Granloholm/Oscars Sommarstuga, respectively, and got a whoppingly better sound than on \\\\\\\"42\\\\\\\".


At the moment, they\\\\\\\'re looking for more gigs and new places/venues to play,
and the new demo, \\\\\\\"Restaurantica Prefect\\\\\\\" is out to the masses.
