,FSSR.Keyno,2006-09-15T05:39Z,Oh Humpie behave
,NullCharacter,2006-09-15T05:41Z,"chlwotjd,

Yes, this is pretty much useless as we can all download it from the FS2Crew site. Since there are no un-wrappers capable of un-wrapping this program we are t the mercy of someone who has purchsed it. The F1 loader will place a copy of the installer in their C:\FS2Crew folder during the setup and leave it there.

The license file check is another matter. However, I'm sure that between all of us here we can find a way to crack it."
