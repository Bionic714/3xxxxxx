REQ: FSS Saab 340"
,[T_A],2006-09-24T23:31Z,How many FS Globbal Packs are there?
,DaftHonk,2006-09-25T04:50Z,Almost there folks.  Africa will be the last pack.
,DaftHonk,2006-09-25T04:57Z,"[T_A]: There are 6 packs total.

North America, South America, Europe, Asia, Africa, and Oceanic.

At this point, it looks like I've seeded about 30% of Asia.  Once there are some seeders to help me out, I'll up the torrent for Africa.

And a final note, would anyone have use for a torrent of BirdsEyeView Vols 1-5?  I've noticed that the current separate torrents are rather slow (it took me almost 2 weeks to download volume 5, and it's only 107MB!!).  So if that's something you'd like, let it be known."
