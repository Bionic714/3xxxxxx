  Uploaders Notes:
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  -  First of all, this i a huge torrent. So please be patient when you download,
     I only have 1 Mbit up, so I guess we are talking about 24 hours. If that isnt 
     fast enough for you, wait for another torrent or go elsewhere.

  -  For better download speed, make sure you have the correct ports open in your
     router and/or firewall. Visit http://www.portforward.com/ for more info.
     It also helps if you dont download other torrents at the same time.
