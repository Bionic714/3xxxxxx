,kaaas,2006-09-23T18:46Z,"Anyone who would like to split the game into 2 dvds,
Then here is how to do it

1)Extract the 'ISO'

2)Open the 'ISO' on 'Ultra-ISO' or a similar program

3)Extract \""data4.cab\"" and \""data5.cab\"" into a new folder

4)After successful extraction of the two files, delete them from the 'ISO'

5)Now save the 'ISO' (it will be about 4GB)

6)Close and restart 'Ultra-ISO'

7)Drag and drop \""data4.cab\"" and then \""data5.cab\""(the two files you extracted earlier)

8)Save this new ISO as 'DVD2'

9)Burn both ISO files using nero and label the discs accordingly

REMEMBER:::

Install using the first dvd to start with (DVD1)

Setup will prompt you during installation for 'CD3' and at this point swap (DVD1) to (DVD2)

You will be prompt again for 'CD4' and again swap (DVD2) to (DVD1)

The game works perfectly, and for those of you who have second thoughts of downloading it because people have said it sucks: It doesn't. The game is actually quite good. You could say it's a mix between GTA: San Andreas and Far Cry, but much better and extremly good graphics.

,joeypesci,2006-09-27T16:39Z,"Works fine.  Use Ultra-ISO to unpack the ISO, some other package don't seem to read the ISO.

So far I've decided this:

It's looking like a console port so far. You die and that's it you have to reload your last save, instead of loading at a hospital like GTA. The graphics aren't that good. If my AGP 128mb Geforce 6800 is running them all on high with no lag, then obviously something is missing from the graphics (suggesting its a console port even more). Navigation via the keyboard in the menu's is annoying, and suggests a console port again. No option for gamma, brightness correction. The bloom looks as if it's a sly way of hiding the not so great graphics from the console players. Just slamed into something and the game CTD. The targetting seems clunky. No option for AA, again, suggesting it's a console port.

Not that great after all.  But for free, I guess it's fine.  But I wouldn't pay for it."

I cant unrar - mount - or something.
What should i do, for installing ?

Please help"
[T],sotis,2006-09-30T22:25Z,@ Makxan: Är du helt säker på att nerladdningen är 100% klar? I så fall så kör en SFV-check (se info ovan) och radera eventuellt defekta filer. Sen är det bara att påbörja en ny nerladdning till samma ställe. Då kommer du bara att behöva ladda ner de raderade filerna. Om det inte är några defekta filer kanske du använder en gammal version av WinRAR? Hoppas att det fixar sig!
,mrva,2006-09-30T22:26Z,Tjaba har ungefär samma feö som yeurbebe men ja kan rara upp allt men inte mounta den säger unvalid imagefilen och filändelsen e .iso kan inte heller öppna den frö att klöra setup på det viset .. HJÄLP ..
[T],sotis,2006-09-30T22:27Z,@ Yeurbabe: Make sure you have an updated version of WinRAR and do an SFV check to ensure that all files are complete. Read the information at the top of the page.
[T],sotis,2006-09-30T22:31Z,@ mrva: Vad kör du för version av Daemon? Själv kör jag bara 3.47 och det funkar i alla fall bra. Om du inte får till det så prova gärna att köra en SFV check på rar-filerna innan du packar upp.
,Makxan,2006-09-30T23:11Z,"Tack Sotis för svar, ja glömde att skriva att ja gjort ett sfv-check och där visas att alla filer är defekta utam rar-fil nr 66 som är okej och ja vill helst inte ladda hem nästan alla filer igen:S"

Det ja gjorde för att få det att funka var att byta till U-torrent och inte pausa nedladdningen ngn gång. Alla som haft problem med uppackning kan ju testa att byta till U-torrent, det går även snabbare med U-torrent;). Ja ska seeda tills min ratio minst är 2.0, promise.
Tack så mycket.


Yees. It works fine for me now. Good release and it's amazing that it was released on the piratebay the same day it was released in stores. To get it work I changed to U-torrent and didn't pause the downloading any time. You who got problems with unpacking the files can do so, U-torrent is faster than e.g. Bitcomet too.
I promise to seed until my ratio is at least 2.0.
Thank you"

And by the way, try to use, you know, your brains before whining all over the comment section.  It gets in the way of the helpful comments."

I have seeded about 5 gigs so far, and will continue to seed because this torrent is so good! I hope to download this torrent again when I get a really good gaming laptop! 

And by the way. You just need to extract ONE of the RAR files! Not all of em'!

Have a great time in San Esperito! I know I did!"

NEVER use O2 for your internet, they bandwidth throttle torrents, knowing you can't complain about it."

,skulldragon,2012-07-21T22:22Z,"This game is awesome. I wonder, why I never heard of this before. It's like GTA Vice City in some way. Game has some problems with sound stuttering and subtitles and sound and video being out of sync at cut-scenes, but overall it's worth to play. You can even go mountain climbing with vehicles! Name games, which even allow mountain climbing!

There are only 2 gaming GPUs: AMD and NVIDIA, the rest is amateur crap.
For Intel HD to work, the game needs to actually be built to support Intel HD. And currently there are only 4, 2011 games, which are.

There's nothing wrong with this torrents speed. It's all about your country's anti-piracy laws and your country's economy.
For example, I live in one of the poorest eastern europe countries, which after every half year lies, that it's #1 in IT thing, but we all still get no torrent throttling at all or anything about anti-piracy. Even 90% of software that our cops use, are pirated. My speed is always 12Mbit, sometimes 10Mbit. Wish I had fiber optics instead."
