,bismark,2006-09-16T23:36Z,"No it does not have subtitles. The movie is in English. And I will be glad if someone gives me a link to a subtitles for the movie. Because I don't want to bother to make some, because of the time codes. All so the quality of this movie is high. And whats wrong with the category ?"
