That was just stupid. You use this so you can share a litle bit all the time becuse torrent apps kills you b/w. Thanks for the app btw."
,unnie,2006-11-26T16:01Z,"This is just a good way of taking off bandwidth from software that don't need it, so better progs like your ""famous"" torrent apps can seed more. Of course that's the deal - do as you please, people.

Oh, and thank you.."
