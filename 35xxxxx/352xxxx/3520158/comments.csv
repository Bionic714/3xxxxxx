,BitLordMan,2006-10-27T06:22Z,deaths_angel: You probably had problem with the sound beacuse you have a 2.1 speaker system.. and this versions is for 5.1 systems..
,PierceUK,2006-11-14T20:44Z,You probably thought the sound was distorted because in the first scene it is.... after that it is lovely and clear and great quality rip as well. Thanks alot!

,djkino,2006-12-15T07:03Z,"No sound? Go here: http://www.divxmovies.com/faq/

Do a word search (Ctrl + F), look for ac3 codec, download the codec. Viola, you now have sound.

Sound is there, but hard to hear? If you downloaded the codec, you now have AC3Filter in your program list. Open AC3Filter Config, and in the box Gain, raise the ""Master"" slider to +20dB. That should help."
