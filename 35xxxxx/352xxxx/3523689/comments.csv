,thedesmodus,2006-09-14T07:03Z,Wow.. 75 people downloaded.. and no one that can take the time to post if this version even works.
,blookesmoke,2006-09-14T09:37Z,I didn't download this one. But if the keygen is called TM6_kg_4_C4PDA.exe then it doesn't work on a palm tungsten T3.
,blookesmoke,2006-09-14T10:18Z,I downloaded it now. Indeed doesn't the keygen doesn't work.
,mundisum,2006-09-14T18:09Z,"The keygen is a MS DOS application that asks for a mid-filename???

The start.exe is not a valid exe-file!

What crap is this :-("
,mundisum,2006-09-14T18:19Z,Sorry! didn't read all the instructions :-)
,Invisible Man,2006-09-15T10:36Z,"Guys , I'm still struggling. 

I can't seem to get the thing to install properly.
i.e what files go where and in what directory on the mem card. 
I've tried several combinations to no avail. (and yes, I've read the instructions.)

Could one of you fine folks please provide some instructions or a list of what files go where??

Many thanks!!"
,mundisum,2006-09-15T12:13Z,"I'm also struggeling!

I've installed it on my Treo 650m.
When i start it up i get sys error message and after that a reboot.

Please advice."
,vd31450,2006-09-15T15:34Z,I follow the instructions but the keygen (in the map directory) doesn't give the right code using the prompt command. It doesn't work :( for me. It should work for some of you...
,caughtstealing,2006-09-15T17:35Z,Works fine for me !!!!!
,caughtstealing,2006-09-15T17:37Z,works on a palm tungsten T3 !!!
,blookesmoke,2006-09-15T21:42Z,It didn't generate a correct code for my T3. What's going on here?
,blookesmoke,2006-09-15T23:00Z,"Its working. Finally got it. Important is to first activate the ""Guam"" card. After that all cards will work automatically."
,kcmok,2006-09-16T04:25Z,"What should be entered for ""device ID""? I input the SN of the lifedrive and it does not work."
,mirkoski,2006-09-19T21:40Z,"Help me. I'ts work for Mitac-Mio 168 or not. 

Thanks."
,hookedtothisnow,2006-09-20T18:27Z,So what maps are included??
,zippa80,2006-09-21T20:55Z,"Is it possible to get it to work on Palm T5? I only get the massage ""Not enough Dynamic Heap Memory to run this application"".

And tried it on Palm T5?"
,dudevski,2006-09-22T19:16Z,"The Keygen gives me trouble, I enter cmd in windows and type ""TT6_kg_4_C4Pda North_America.mid"" like specified, then it asks me for Device ID and I enter Treo 650 IMEI, but then it says: Wrong Device ID Symbols...WTF?

It be so awsome if someone could get the activation for maps working..."
,geeman,2006-09-27T03:32Z,"Works fine here. Thanks.

Here's the process... unpack all the RARs into a single directory, then copy the works onto a SD card. Plug it into your Palm (E2 in my case) and it will autoplay. Follow the instructions, eventually it'll ask you to register - do it manually, and it will give you an ID code.

Use the keygen, with this ID code and the guam file, to generate your activation code. Enter it, and you're in business."
,doublejunk,2006-09-28T20:28Z,"Hi all! Thanks for all the info. Download worked. Loading on yreo 700 worked. App worked. Guam map activation worked. Can't activate any other maps including a US map on same SD card as Guam map.

Any thoughts anyone?"
,jockboy,2006-09-29T08:29Z,"To get this application to run on a Palm T5 (and perhaps other ""unsupported"" Palms??) there is a hack called Unlimited Dynamic Memory Hack available at Palmpowerups.com. It works but it's a bit dirty! You need to register each map you use  following the methods previously described here"
,orniter,2006-10-02T02:41Z,It seems that this wasn't packaged with any voices.  Anyone know what to do or which torrent to download to get voice instructions working?  Thanks!
,qitoday,2006-10-18T21:26Z,can anybody give a copy of the instruction file to me please? i can not find it after unzip... many thanks! my email is swansea121@126.com
,voytektom,2006-10-24T09:49Z,"Thanks, thedesmodus !!

this rocks on TX and T3 !!"
,rufridr916,2006-11-01T09:17Z,"Ive got it working but I cant get the keygen to work. Ive tried everything a person can do, can someone tell me if there is a trick with the keygen? thanks in advance."

,Rabbak1,2006-11-06T21:55Z,"It's perfect working with Palm TX 
Thanks !!!"
,Rabbak1,2006-11-06T22:16Z,"You need to activate the card (Guam - in this cas ) to get this think to work . For this you need to know 2 thinks - your device ID ( NOT IMEI in case of Treo ! ) and the card activation code . 
Firs - unzip this in your PC hard drive . It will be several directories anf files + zipped key generator . Copy everything (exlude the geygenerator )  to your PALM flash card (SD card in case of Tungten , TX and Zire ) , then insert card into your PALM . Tomtom will be started automatically . Got to the ""Change preferences"" and open ""Manage Maps"" -> ""Switch Map"" . Then take the Guam . After it will ask you ito activate id , tak ""manual"" process then it will show you your handheld ID ( usualy 10 symbols ) .Write it down .On your PC unzip the keygenerator file TT6_kg_4_C4Pda.exe into your map directory (Guam in this case ) .Open your PC (!) in DOS mode ( Start->Run->CMD ) .Go to your map directory with extracted TT6_kg_4_C4Pda.exe file and run the follow : 
TT6_kg_4_C4Pda.exe Guam.exe 
In the follow prompt : Enter Device Id give the your device number , written before , then enter and you will get the activation code . Enter this code in your handheld device and enjoy . You can also tak only TomTom6 maps ( Canada-Alaska from http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3546707/TomTom_6.5_Map_MegaBundle...working_Alaska-Canada_Map_portion )  and copy only Canada-Alaska folder with maps then the generate the activation code in the same way .
Enjoy"
,brucewillee,2006-11-12T03:35Z,"Product works without a flaw.  Sometimes get memory issues on Palm TX - some attribute this to the nonvolatile flash memory.  Application runs slower than TomTom 5.  Look at Rabbak1's post for installation.  This installation is not for the computer newbies.

Enjoy!!!!"
,Wauli,2006-11-14T13:21Z,"Hi 2 all... please help, I'm losing my mind. There is no Guam exe. I need to activate the card....what card??? (in this case Guam???). Can someone give me clear instructions on how to get something from the keygen.  I'm sure this is a great product and I'm itching to give it try. Someone please help me, my nerves are about to snap :("
,MONTMAESTRO,2006-11-19T11:17Z,"Hi
can anyone help,when i use the keygen it asks for id code , i enter & it just goes off..can any one generate a code for me my product code is ANEA8 B5PFW"
,quickshot123,2006-11-21T19:36Z,"Hey montmaestro, i generated a code for you: 2ACGA WVV7Q F3E5A"
,stewpot32,2006-11-23T23:28Z,"Rabbak1 info is good . . . but here are a few other pointers
1) Run TT6_kg_4_C4Pda.exe + ""name of map file"".mid
2) Any .mid file will work as input to the generator within a folder.
3) You need a new activation code for each map
4) When you input your device ID, do use Caps lock!
Enjoy!"
,Jondot,2006-11-26T23:41Z,"Help! I downloaded and extrated all the files to my 1gb SD card, and when i stick it in I get the tomtom logo, then I'm back to the previous screen. I'm using a TX. Any ideas?"
,ckmate2001,2006-11-27T17:27Z,"Hi,
This key gen is driving me nuts, I have tried to do it with USA Canada maps but once I enter my device ID code the dos screen disappears and it does not give me a code. My device id code is AB4HU BD9QN can anyone please generate a code for me for the USA Canada maps.  cheers.  "
,ckmate2001,2006-11-27T18:12Z,"ok,
the keygen works and will geenrate a key but you will have to go to command prompt to operate it, in otherwords, go to command prompt screen first, change to the maps directory, then typr the command and it will ask you for a device id and you enter it and then it will give you a code. the code it gave me did not work for me. maybe because I am using a dell axim x51v and this is made for a palm but i dont see the connection. any views on that? cheers."
,Jondot,2006-11-27T21:04Z,"You probably won't get a palm application to work on windows mobile. I'm not sure, but it sounds like a dead end.

However, there's a load of Tomtom for windows mobile torrents, like this: http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3410079/TOMTOM_NAVIGATOR_5_with_working_POI_and_GB_PLUS_MAP_(Updated_to_

,Jondot,2006-11-29T19:02Z,"DAMN. 

I got it working (I left out one file by mistake), and it was all great. I even downloaded some extra voices and a GB map. Worked great!

...until I plugged it into my navigation companion. It gives me an application error ""please reinstall the program..."" then refuses to recognise the device. Bah..."

I have a Tomtom One, followed the directions to generate activation keys, and got keys without problem. Problem is they don't work on my Tomtom one - error with wrong activation code.

,pushf12,2006-12-02T07:15Z,"Takkar.  This works on my Treo.

Navigator 6 will read maps, voices, and extras in the \TomTom folder, so it lets you keep the root of the SD card clean.  Very nice."
,ckmate2001,2006-12-04T20:54Z,"f1maestro and to everyone else that can not get past the screen that flashes too fast.
Fisrt, download this keygen and once finished you need to unrar it, once finished copy the keygen file and click on my computer icon, then click on c drive icon and paste the file.
Next (very important) click START on your desktop then go to ALL PROGRAMS then click ACCESSORIES then go to COMMAND PROMPT and click on it. Now a black window should  pop up. then you type cd.. and hit enter anddo that again and again until all you see is C:/ once you see that typr the name of the file which begins with tt6 to the end including the .exe and space and then type the map file name and hit enter. it should then ask you for your device code go ahead typr it in including the space in between and hit enter and viola you should have your code displayed. This code will only work for palm"
,hukalaki,2006-12-08T14:38Z,"OK I did it all as directed--and I actually own the Palm TT6 GPS system, I'm just trying to use it on another device so I don't have to take my Treo CDMA to europe. 

The keygen app is in the Guam folder. I run the keygen in command prompt with "" Guam.mid"" following it. The Key Gen tells me ""Can't open file 'Guam.mid'

I've tried my TT6 Western Europe file (put  KeyGen in WE folder and ran it from there) and that didn't work either. 

Any suggestions? Or can someone just run me a code: here's my device: AJBZL 42K72.

Also, is it the same code for all maps?

Thanks very much."
,Praetoriangard,2006-12-12T03:01Z,"Hi there. I just downloaded the GB map and it had no mid file in it. After mucking about for a while, I found out that if you

1. copy Guam.mid into the Map folder
2. Rename Guam.mid with the name of ur map ~(u'll find examples in the folder)
3. Run TT6_kg_4_C4pda with the new ""yourmap.mid"" file....

The new code works. Im running this on a Tungsten T5. HAvent gotten a gps reciever to test it but will do in a few days.

,jakester,2006-12-30T04:31Z,"This method was done successfully on a TREO650
1) Create a folder on your PC's Hard Drive, I called mine ""TTtemp"" 
2) Extract all the files for the TomTom Application to the new folder (TTtemp)
3) Copy the following from the folder (TTtemp) to your SD card
	Folders:2577, itn, palm, raster, schemes, tomtom, voices
	File: Start.exe
4) Locate your Map folder. We will use GUAM (Other examples are North_America). 
5) Copy your map folder (GUAM) to the SD Card. (In this folder there must be a file called GUAM.mid)
6) Insert your SD card into your device. TomTom will start automatically.
7) Go through the setup and when you get to Activating your map, Select ""Manual"" process
8) This will show you the Device ID. Write it down.
9) Now, back on your PC, Extract and copy to the map folder (GUAM) the KeyGen program(TM6_kg_4_C4PDA.exe)
10) open a DOS window on your PC. Navigate to the map folder GUAM
11) In DOS, execute the exe file by typing: TM6_kg_4_C4PDA.exe GUAM.mid
12) At the prompt, enter in your Device ID (no spaces). And a Activation code will be generated.
13) Go back to your Device and enter in your Activation code (no spaces)
14) For any other maps, you will have to copy the map folder to your Device, then copy the keygen to the map folder on your PC and then execute the program like above substituting your ""map_name.mid"" for GUAM.mid above.
15) Enjoy!"

I had a virus detected by Bitdefender. No problem.
I would like to bring some comment on How-to, because it will save some time...
1/ After having unzip/unrar to the same directory ""TT6"" for instance (*), copy all the files inside the directories only to your SD card (Directly ! in using a card reader, Not in using Palm install)
2/ Then place your SD card into your palm
3/ Execute the icon ""navigator"" you see on the screen
4/ When activating the code, you are given a Device ID code, THIS IS the one you have to enter on your PC (See below)
5/ To get the final application password: 
* you click on ""START"" on you PC screen 
* ""run""
*Type ""cmd"" then ""enter"" to get a DOS window
* then enter the path where you placed all your files (See #1 (*) like ""cd TT6""
* Then ""cd Guam""
* Using windows explorer copy ""TT6_kg_4_C4Pda.exe"" inside ""Guam"" directory
*Then execute the following in the DOS window:
TT6_kg_4_C4Pda.exe Guam.mid  and press enter
* You will be prompted for a device ID code, this is the one given by TomTom on you Palm screen
* Enter it, take care with capitals and spaces 
and you will be given a code you have to copy onto your Palm screen .
Indulge!
