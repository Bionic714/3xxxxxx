,Texaslambada,2006-09-30T17:41Z,"Why can`t I burn this to a dvd?? I`m using ImgTool, but it says  ""Backup file 'VTS_04_0.BUP' should be identical to 'VTS_04_0.IFO' "" and so on and so on!"
,Texaslambada,2006-10-01T11:37Z,"Maaaan! Having some problems here. Now I tried to copy the IFO- files, restoring them with the BUP- files and changing their names to BUP- files, but still I can`t burn it to a DVD. This message comes up ""Error: Missing needed file: ""VIDEO_TS.BUP"" ==> BREAK!"" ..HELP!!!"
,rhebult,2006-10-02T20:30Z,try copying all files in a folder VIDEO_TS. Burn that folder on a DVD and presto...
,Texaslambada,2006-10-02T20:55Z,Well.. The files are allready located in a folder named VIDEO_TS... and this folder I can`t burn..
,Texaslambada,2006-10-04T14:56Z,It will not buuuuurn!!! What the f... is wrong!!! Can anyone please tell me if this file is burnable at all??!! What program are u using and so on and so on??
,lemotta,2006-10-05T22:03Z,"Hello,I had the same problem,i did this!! I removed the five IFO files, and then copied the five BUP files into another map and renamed them into IFOfiles and then i copied them back.And it worked,,sorry about my bad english!!! I can explain better in swedish.."
,Texaslambada,2006-10-05T22:44Z,"Thanx! 
By the way.. when I tried to extract the files in the video_ts folder earlier today, Norton Antivirus found and removed a trojan named ""dll6wise.dll"" .. I read about it on the net and it could cause u some trouble! It should be said that I`m not completely sure the trojan was located in this files, or in the program I extracted with... "
,Texaslambada,2006-10-05T23:05Z,lemotta... jeg snakker selv norsk så du er hjertelig velkommen til bruke svensk :) ... får fortsatt ikke dette til å fungere! Samme error oppstår! Endrer du kun hovednavnet til BUP- filene du kopierer til IFO- filer? Under hovednavnet står det fortsatt at det er en backup- fil....
,lemotta,2006-10-06T10:01Z,"Jag tog bort IFO filerna, kopierade BUP filerna till en annan plats på hårddisken,döpte om dem till IFO   istället för BUP kopierade tillbaka dem till sin plats då blir filerna identiska det var ju det som var problemet. Det funkade för mej.."
,Wetbones,2006-10-08T17:05Z,I used DVDShrink on the VIDEO_TS folder I downloaded and just ripped that to another section of my hard drive. After doing that I was able to burn the resulting folder to DVD-R without any problems (using Nero because I'm gay). 
,silveraxe,2007-01-30T13:57Z,Hi! Is there Finnish subs?
