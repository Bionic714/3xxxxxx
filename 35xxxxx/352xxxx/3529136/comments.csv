,Triplehammer,2006-09-26T04:24Z,"Be sure to read the wikipedia article, as the original retail version was seriously bugged, and even final patched versions still had some unresolved problems.

,Dunmer,2006-10-01T18:54Z,how can i make it work on windows xp?
,Gourr,2006-10-04T08:43Z,DOSBox (http://dosbox.sourceforge.net/) can be used to make this run on Windows XP.
[V],nimbus123,2006-10-30T10:19Z,Finally gotta play this game. Hope it works
,nymersic,2006-11-25T05:40Z,"Whenever I try starting this with DosBox, I either get the ""invalid startup directory"" error or the ""incorrect cd"" error, depending on what way I go about doing it.  I'm a very infrequent user of DosBox so I imagine I'm doing something wrong.  Not to mention I see the NoCD.bat file, but have no idea what to do with it.  Any advice?"
,Jcoo,2007-04-14T15:34Z,"I don't know how to install this.  It asks for a CDPath, which I don't have because I don't have the CD...am I supposed to place a certain file here?"
,schaeffer2,2007-10-13T23:10Z,"i tried to get this to run on DOSBox .72 but it wont work (mainly because I only use it to run TES 1 ARENA and I knew how there because there was a guide.) I set up the game and evrything, but still need help. "
,schaeffer2,2007-10-13T23:27Z,"o wait nvm lol, 
to all you who are just confused as i was heres what you do (Listen if you have XP)

1.) When unpacking, do it in main drive, no where else. Like I had my DAGGER files in my Desktop. e.g. Directory C: (and thats it)

2.) B4 playing set up the game in the SETUP file so that you can get video and sound. 

3.) This is a pirated version, so you cant start it normally, you have to run NoCD to run the game. 

and also...
4.) XP users, you dont need to run DOSBox, but if you want to... here is what i did to run it:

a.) normal mount on the drive that you put Dagger fall in. e.g. ""MOUNT C C:\"" then press enter
then ""C:"" then press enter again also dont put in the """" 

b.) ""CD\DAGGER""

c.) then dont type ""DAGGER"" because theres no cd (unless you have the CD put if you do you probably wouldnt be reading this lols) instead type in ""NOCD"" then it should run..."
,monopoly171,2008-02-03T19:55Z,"When I run the NoCD file the screen turns black and it sais ""Daggerfall has detected the error 0."" What should I do?"
,cthulhu221,2008-02-23T01:21Z,Any one care to seed this marvelous game? Please?
,Dorkvader1212,2008-03-13T22:02Z,does this game come with all the patches or do i need to find those too?
,eger_666,2008-10-15T21:32Z,Seed pls
,scewy,2009-07-14T00:50Z,This game is now free to download from bethesda's website.
,serenity3212,2011-01-24T04:59Z,"it's going to take two weeks to download this, I hope it works"
,kokoliko,2011-11-05T12:00Z,"This game is available for free at:

Yey! :)"
,Early_Riser,2012-03-16T00:13Z,"Thank you very much Gourr. On a Win98 system this works great, no dosbox required and more importantly, no screwing around with trying to mount a virtual CD.
Amendment to schaeffer2's instructions: A dosbox may not be required for an XP32 system, but any 64 bit system does need one. Also if the game is not in ""C:DAGGER"" you will get ""error 0"" when you try to run NOCD.bat One last thing, if you don't want to deal with mounting a virtual drive, avoid bethesda's free download and use this one instead."
