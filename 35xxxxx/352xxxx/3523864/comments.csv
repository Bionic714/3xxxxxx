,Billy Joe Bob,2006-09-14T18:04Z,Hell yeah ! ^^
,BlankWyman,2006-09-15T03:40Z,"Btw you won't be able to play online, unless you use some kinda VPN, because it gives you an ""Invalid CD Key"" error."
,BlankWyman,2006-10-15T04:18Z,":@ No one's seeding this with me!! at all!!!

f***ing leechers... i seeded this for 14.67 Gbs... and NO other seeds other than me!!

I'm giving up, seems like no one likes helping out anymore."
,BlankWyman,2006-10-15T04:23Z,"I'm gonna start easing myself off this torrent by slowing my upload to 10kb/s, which i have done.

next step will be 5kb/s.

the next step after that, if people continue to l33ch, will be that i will stop seeding altogether."
