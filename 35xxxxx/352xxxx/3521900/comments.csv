,dennis_ase,2006-09-11T22:14Z,how i can install this on my nokia 6280? anyone who can help me with this? is any tomtom working on my model and how i can that work?
,GasGiver4711,2006-09-12T01:10Z,To install *.cab files on ur PDA just copy to Card or to PDA Memory - then double click from the filemanager - thats all
,GasGiver4711,2006-09-12T01:12Z,Now a Germany only map would be fine - got Europe (some 1.6 GB) and Western Europe (about 1GB) but i dont wanna fill the card all up with maps i dont need ;-)
,esmith13,2006-09-12T04:51Z,will this read tomtom 5 maps? if not any1 know where to get USA maps?
,TheChief,2006-09-12T15:08Z,"CAB files can only be installed from the phone,PDA,PPC.
So the instructions are :
copy the 2 maps with tt6today and ttn6ifalleni to your card.
Then use file explorer to find these CAB files and tap 2 times on each of them to install these files.
Take tt6today first.
So ttn6ifalleni second.
Take so all files in the last map and copied these files to your card(Files inside the Map)
So when you use file explore, you can see directly the on files on your card.
Then copied the Maps from you have downloaded to your card.
But see if there is a map inside the map.
It there is a map called scandinavian there can`t be a map inside with the same names, there can only be one map.

Map --) all the files.
Not Map --) and new map--) and the files"
,TheChief,2006-09-12T15:59Z,If you change map with folders the things will be okay.
,TheChief,2006-09-12T21:03Z,"I think your problem is your GPS try to uninstalled it from your PDA,PPC completly.Then reinstalled it and use com 7 and secure connection.
Then use another bluetooth connection in TomTom if this doesn`t work try different speeds on your GPS receiver.
I have a Solar GPS,Super Track and Qtek 9100 and uses the highest speed on the receivers.
I had problems with com 6 on my Qtek 9100.
Why ?
I don`t know.
Take a soft resett on your PDA,PPC"
,bierflasche,2006-09-12T21:04Z,"The PPC Vers. will work on Qtek 8310, but you can not naviate in the Programm, because the Qtek 8310 have not a touchscreen. But you can it install. Im looking for the WM5 Smartphone cab file.....Please share it"
,Aleem,2006-09-12T23:07Z,"Excellent! Works well. I have TomTom Navigator 5 already, so can I copy my Great_Britain-maps form TomTom Navigator 5 to Navigator 6? If so, how do I do it? Thanks!"
,TheChief,2006-09-12T23:58Z,"TomTom 6 is much better than TomTom 5.2.
Like emo7777 says is worth downloading and testing.
I don`t know if the new maps work on the old version.But the new version is much better.

emo7777 is the TheMaster of TomTom.
Thank You Again."
,TheChief,2006-09-13T00:02Z,"Just take your old map and copy it on your card.
Then you choose it from your TomTom preference."
,TheChief,2006-09-13T09:37Z,"Sorry ment TOMTOM 6.0 CRACKED.
But anyway here is it:
CAB files can only be installed from the phone,PDA,PPC.

So the instructions are :

copy the 2 folders with tt6today and ttn6ifalleni to your card.

Then use file explorer to find these CAB files and tap 2 times on each of them to install these files.

It there is a folder called scandinavian, there can`t be a map inside with the same names, there can only be one folder with the maps.

Folder --) all the files.

Not Folder --) and new folder--) and the files "
,anotherwiseguy,2006-09-13T14:33Z,I also had the problem with missing voices (Loox 720). I got it to work by moving the voices from the folder on my CF card into /Program Files/navigator/voices in the main memory. Hope it helps.

,TheChief,2006-09-13T20:31Z,"So your TomTom is starting and only shows GUAM the Map.When I downloaded the Scandinavian foldermap there was a new folder inside this also called Scandinavian.You have probaly removed this so you have only One foldermap.Inside the Scandinavian foldermap there should be 15 files.Before you copy it to your Card rename it to Scandinavian.Your Structure is fine so your problem is the map, try the other maps from emo7777."

It's crash the sound on iPaq and the only way is to do a hard reset to get the sound back and then reinstall all programs. For me it is a couple of hours to get the iPac back on track again.

By the way TomTom 5.21 works excellent on hx2490b."

,raze-73,2006-09-22T19:56Z,"REGARDING THE GPS CONNECTING ISSU 

The 6900 does not experience the sound issue. You have to do a registry fix for tomtom to see the GPS though. (for the 6900)
""OK. Found the solution to make TT6 work on the 69XX. Go into your registry at: HKEY_LOCAL MACHINE>System>CurrentControlSet>GPS Intermediate Driver and change the key for IsEnabled from 1 to 0.
After you do that it will communicate with the internal GPS.""

Download and use ""RegEdit.Net"" tried others but they didnt work 
GOOD LUCK...Dont get lost on the way LOL ;)"
