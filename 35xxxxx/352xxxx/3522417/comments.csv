By the way there is cd-key generator which generates you a valid cd-key.  Then just copy & paste the crack (CoD2SP_s) in the program files -> activion -> Call Of Duty 2 folder. 
And for everyone who is confused ""CoD2MP_s""-file, it's just MP, multiplayer. Ofcourse before this all, you have to run the setup file. :)
It's not so hard. Mounting is prob the hardest thing in this case.
Good luck and thanks."

,HelloX,2009-08-03T10:53Z,What do you mean with copy the cracked exe?
,EvilPirater,2009-10-25T14:07Z,"@HelloX

He means copy the cracked .exe. Seriously someone needs to teach people lessons about these things.

Basically you copy the game con in the torrent and paste it over the one that's in the folder where COD 2 was installed.

Jeez..."

,Suedama,2010-11-21T13:58Z,"Here is how I got mine to work. Download the contents on utorrent, once complete you need a key code. So go to piratebay.org and type call of duty 2 keygen. Then you run the app of the Keygen and you will get a key. Type it into the box, if it doesn't work click generate and type the next. Eventually you will get it and I think you guys know the rest. "
