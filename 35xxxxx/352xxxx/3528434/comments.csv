[T],bi20,2006-09-25T15:44Z,"I set my laptop to boot from the usb but it skips this winxp and boots from hd, what's wrong with this?"
[T],bi20,2006-09-26T03:24Z,"duck, i just said ""I set my laptop to boot from the usb"" which is exactly what you're suggesting. I boot from USB and the pc doesn't like it. what's wrong?"
,rjsteve56,2006-09-26T06:24Z, you need a program like HP Drive Key Boot Utility to make your flash drive bootable
,wiztez,2006-09-26T18:39Z,other way is to just disable ur HD from the boot list so only the usb is active at boot that way it has no choice
[T],bi20,2006-09-26T23:10Z,"well, if it needs another program to run, IMHO it should be included in this torrent :P"
,usucdik,2006-09-28T12:16Z,"You don't really NEED another program, they are just automatic (although not really because they sometimes fucking ask for floppy images and crap)

Try this: go to a command prompt and type ""format Z:\ FS:NTFS /X"" (Z is the drive of the flash device). Then copy ntdetect and ntldr from your system disk (you need to unhide system files from Folder Options). Should be bootable."
,netblitz,2006-10-27T13:54Z,Doesn't work - is it some sort of crap?
,netblitz,2006-10-27T16:41Z,"Finally got it to work:
- formatted USB Stick using HP USB Disk Storage Format Tool (NTFS)
- installed the system
- it boots into the famous BartPE on USB Stick"
,Iza177,2006-11-09T16:04Z,any one know if it works?
,tarverlee,2006-11-18T07:23Z,how do I extract the files? There are about 8 zip files. I know...I'm an idiot but who cares if I get an answer right?

,dsllnx,2007-07-03T09:29Z,"Don't work fo me. I have used those tools from HP, but stil don't work. I get this msg when boot computer with the stick: Non-System disk or disk error replace and strike any key when ready.

And yes; my laptop is set to boot from usb. I use a linux distro on usb and works great. I want to use Win on other stick (Corsair GT 2GB)"
