Anyone got a NO-DVD crack?"

,Drunken Munkey,2006-11-15T17:44Z,"Doesn't work for me, I can load it fine until it reaches a screen saying something like ""accept english language"" and the enter key symbol. The screen is blank apart from this text.

Pressing enter doesn't do anything and it just stops there doing nothing. Also, the resolution is terrible as far as I can see (up to the bit with the language text) even though I've got the settings turned up to max resolution and graphics because I know my PC will easily handle it. No change in the settings seems to affect the resolution, even windowed mode it still runs at full screen. Any ideas?"

,Palle-Pirat,2007-01-04T09:19Z,"Hi.
Great game this one. I'm having hours of fun with this.
Anyway, using no ""no-dvd-crack"" from gamecopyworld (including the starter.exe and the sbike.exe files) works fine for me. But what about a ""saved game"" with all bikes and raceways enabled...?
Anyone got this and is willing to share it..?"
,Drunken Munkey,2007-01-11T16:05Z,"So... this game works fine you you chaps?

It just won't work at all for me. What systems are you running the game on and are you using a patched version?

I can't seem to find any patches or updates for the game anywhere.

Help anyone, please?"

,drjacko,2010-04-28T16:59Z,I have no idea about the problem that other people are having. But this game works perfectly for me. And it is a great one. I extracted it from the archive and then mounted it with Daemon Tools.  It was smooth.

Riding bicycles for work commutes and errands not only saves customers money, but generates a fantastic deal of revenue at local and state levels, reports Elly Blue for Grist. I found this here: Economic effect of biking vs. driving tremendous economic impact on communities By conservative estimate, each person in the U.S. who drives a vehicle to work could conserve between $ 3,000 and $ 12,000 annually. Yearly, the total grows by approximately $ 1,000.
