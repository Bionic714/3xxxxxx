,0rr,2006-09-21T10:23Z,"went back to the 4th september release.

all the bugs before were fixed but now the xbmc doesn't rewind videos burnt on a dvd when playing, they even jump forward. 
videos played from the hdd wind back very slowly only.
the apple trailers don't work anymore although I'm using the same script as before.

radio works, led stuff is fixed, too.

the apple trailers say: list index out of range.
anybody know how to fix this? 

waiting for the next release."
,0rr,2006-09-21T10:46Z,"found another bug in the current release: my evoxdash doesn't load when I do a reboot out of xbmc.
tried several times.

the release from the 4th september loads the dash."
,Pyrii,2006-09-21T17:54Z,Go complain to the makers of XBMC then. Not gasgivers fault they keep breaking stuff =P
