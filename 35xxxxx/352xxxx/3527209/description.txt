This is a small collection of some Gary Numan albums I have.

Strange Charm, Automatic and I, Assassin are vinyl versions, I, Assassin having the extra tracks made up from the B-sides of the 12" versions of the album's singles releases.

The Collection was ripped from a cassette tape I had.

I have tried to clean them up and digitise them as best as I could, so I hope you like.
