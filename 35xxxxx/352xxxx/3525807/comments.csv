Or do you mean Deionized?"

There aren't any Jewish elements in the Matrix trilogy other than the name of their underground city - Zion. But you knew that, right?

I personally find the scenes in Zion to be cheesy and over-the-top. They tried way too hard to make it ""epic"", and ruined it, so I'm not a bit surprised fans chose to edit the Zion crap out to get peace of mind. Only the original Matrix movie is worth watching as-is IMO. Seriously, go watch ep. 2 and 3 and try to keep a straight face when Morpheus is spewing that bullshit rhetoric to the crowd, and then there's the Zion celebration party.. I mean WTF?

Sorry for venting, but it gets to me how badly they could fuck up a movie with such a great potential."

Zion is also the paradisecity where Haile Selassie lives and where rastafari-people go when they die"

The bad guy doesn't always need an ""understandable"" reason to be bad (how is murdering thousands of people understandable)... plus you missed the point of this release, and you are wrong. Your logic is flawed sir.

BTW great job CBB"
