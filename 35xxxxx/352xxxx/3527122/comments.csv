,Kihiro,2006-09-25T02:11Z,"EDIT; Since Sudden strike is a rts-game it is crucial that u can save ur progress in game, otherwise it's impossible to play such game-types... how in the hell i save my game?? do i need a crack or patch or something like that? :s :s
so if i try to save i get error; ""Can't create savegame"" pls help me out, someone...

,BuGa19,2008-01-28T11:54Z,"you need to create a folder ""savegames"" in sudden strike folder , or you can come and play on multiplayer www.cdv.de\ipborse\ip  or download gamespy ( http://thepiratebay.org/tor/4000073/gamespy) "
