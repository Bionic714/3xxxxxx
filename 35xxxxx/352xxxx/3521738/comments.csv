,toofan,2006-09-10T02:02Z,hmm..these new missing files are clone cd images. how do I use them with the rest of files?
,rought69rought,2006-09-10T02:28Z,"thank you for these nice programs..your a kind man....
best way i found was dont mount on a virtual drive just convert to ISO using magic ISO and then use the burn ISO to cd/dvd and just use that disk..."
,rellison,2006-09-10T06:08Z,After you convert to ISO how do you add these new extra file to the ISO??
,FTP1,2006-09-10T12:46Z,"While the question above concerning the integration of the missing files is explained, I'd like to invite all the people who downloaded this series (and I know there are a lot of them) to join me in thanking Ulysses56 for this great contribution. Absolutely fantastic sir. My hat off to you. It's the essence of filesharing. God Bless."
,Fasthand,2006-09-10T16:03Z,"I will also join in the thanking to Ulysses56 for this very nice series of torrents!
My daughter are probably starting to study medicine next year, and I think this will be a very nice gift to her. I will tell her I got them from a very nice guy on the net called Ulysses56!

When thats said, I will be grateful if someone who have done the integration of the missing files to enlighten me how to make a workable CD.
And also give a link to Magic iso or whatever I need to convert img to iso and blend in the missing files.

Thanks"
[T],ulysses56,2006-09-10T21:12Z,"To be honest, Im so tired of making copies of this wonderful series I have on my office. Its work perfect with my laptop but when I started to copy the discs I had a really tough time. Some disc is with ?copy security? and make the whole thing so difficult. If I knew that in the beginning I would never make all this effort. 

But I know it will work in the end for all of you, just try and try like I did. I?m not very technical. 

Take care everybody. 
"
,MrMansson,2006-09-11T10:11Z,"Nice effort! 

I'd really like these too.

But I think I'll wait until someone merges this into two or three working DVDs. 
Would that be ok for you Ulysses56?

,toofan,2006-09-16T12:21Z,"Ive burned to iso & installed it onm my pc. But when I try to run it I get a message, eject & reinsert the cdrom. & it quits."
,mazdon,2006-09-17T17:57Z,"What a sad story.... hmmm
I can get some of these torrent to work... with a lot of trouble.... burning CD:s that doesent work, loading down diffrent programs that doesenÂ´t work to crack this torrent...so sad, I really looked forward to get this torrents as I have a lot of friends that are nurses or working in that area.
But I can see that it will be far to complicated for them to manage this downloads.... so sad.... ;(

Anyway ulysses56, thanks for trying...best regards Maxthegun"

Ive tryed to lounch 2cd, it didnt work (im using power iso), but the cd4 works fine ;). And one more question, why is it better to use img.?

Thx ulysses56, but please use ISO format for any other uploads, it makes life so much easier
P.S. I could not Get Missing Ankle Cd to open noway no how"
