,prox360,2006-09-23T20:47Z,thx nice upload;)
,JJayUK,2006-09-30T23:29Z,Perhaps I'm too new and don't understand the terminology but this clip is fine.  I can't see any moving lines and the picture looks fine.  I'm watching it using VLC - if that helps.  A good episode and (as with them all) worth watching.
,JJayUK,2006-10-01T00:06Z,nexus420:  It's not season 5.  It's brand new.
,Lanix,2006-10-07T11:38Z,"Uhm, must be fake or some old episode mislabeled. Family Guy is atm at season 5. Last episode was:  	
05x03: Hell Comes to Quahog (24/Sep/2006)

Next episode is:
05x04: Saving Private Brian (05/Nov/2006)

Both tvtome.com and tvrage.com show same date for upcoming s05e04."
,cyber857,2006-12-17T09:13Z,people sorry to add to your confusion but tv shows are almost always labled weird look at the post date (when torrent was uploaded) and lok back 1 two days on an offical schedual like tv.com to find out what show was what... or wait for a repack of all shows in a season to date with proper names reuploaded by someone else. thanks and keep seeding ^^
,toast5,2007-09-24T06:39Z,It's not fake. Season 5 has been aired and re-run on Adult Swim (in the US) for ages now. This is a 'new season'.
,toast5,2007-09-24T06:44Z,"New episode*. I give up guessing what season it is, but it is new :P"
