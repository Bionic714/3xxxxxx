,LithuanianHitman,2006-09-24T22:57Z,Is this good quality?
[T],bi20,2006-09-25T14:50Z,"I compressed a lot that image, the original BMP is 3.5MB and looks a lot better. This is the only HD Matrix Reloaded I found, if you find another with better quality please leave a comment."
,markiv34,2006-09-26T04:20Z,What codec has been used
[T],bi20,2006-09-26T14:06Z,"no idea.

,SicKn3sS,2006-09-30T16:16Z,So are the subs stuck in the video stream or what?
,cazo_lo,2006-10-01T16:03Z,"Ohh .... You are a mate man !!!
thanks for this big Suprise, I was looking for a long time at this Piece.
You are great - how you can do this - looks like you're expert on this work.
thanks again!"
,knaak,2006-10-01T17:09Z,I downloaded this but when azureus moved it to my directiry for finished downloads the files are no longer visible.. explorer simply lists 0 files for that folder. this has never happend to me before. does anyone have any ideas on how to recover the files? According to azureus I'm currently seeding this file so they have to be in there somewhere.. btw I run linux on the computer that handles my downloads.
[T],bi20,2006-10-02T16:42Z,"SicKn3sS, the second post says ""separated files"". That should be clear enough :P

cazo_lo, I got that file on eMule ;)

knaak, I have no idea of linux"
,SicKn3sS,2006-10-02T21:46Z,"oh shit lol, didn't see that :P"
,Cmd_Chakotay,2006-10-14T15:13Z,"Perfect quality thnx bi20, keep up the good work."
,stutaylor,2006-10-26T21:07Z,"Got it working fine, managed to turn off subs but is a bit grainy.  The original dvd i've got seems less grainy."
[T],bi20,2006-10-27T02:45Z,less grainy and less resolution. You choose ;)
,couppi,2006-11-14T01:29Z,"Can anyone post step-by-step instructions on how they removed the subtitles? When I remove the sub files from the folder, the colors in the video are all inverted and weird. Also, the volume is shut off any time a character speaks."
[T],bi20,2006-11-17T22:09Z,"I have no idea. I renamed the files, or just made Media Player Classic to stop auto-loading subs. But I did watch the movie successfully without subs."
,RothenbergXXX,2007-01-28T23:34Z,It'd be great if some other people could seed this; I'm at a 5.5 ratio and am now only getting around 10 kbps.
[T],bi20,2008-06-12T20:23Z,if I were you I would download a HD-DVD/BluRay rip instead of this HDTV capture.
,Cyghfer,2008-09-19T03:40Z,"all the dvd rips I've gotten of this cut off some of the image of the original theatrical release. does this have the whole image intact? it doesn't have to be amazing quality or anything.

if so, I'd appreciate a seed, thanks!"
[T],bi20,2008-09-20T11:13Z,I don't know how to know if it has the whole image intact.
