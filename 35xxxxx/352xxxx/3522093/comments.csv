THX - good work"
,quiberon2006,2006-09-13T22:08Z,"Well, in the spirit of lighting a candle rather than cursing the darkness, you are welcome to take this DVD and improve on it.
It is in Windows/Applications because it runs under Windows, of course !
WTF else would you like it to go ?"
,Singular,2006-10-08T18:16Z,"So let me get this straight, this is Knoppix which is run from a DVD by a Windows screensaver?

Does the knoppix run in backround or is it killed when the screensaver dies?"
,quiberon2006,2006-10-11T21:48Z,"The screensaver is a virtual PC, similar to 'vmware' but an open-source one, which 'boots' from a 4GB '.iso' file which is copied to your hard disk.

When you log out of the Knoppix (or, quicker, if you Ctrl-Alt-F and click the X) the virtual PC ends and you are back to where you would have been if the screensaver had not kicked in.

You don't need a DVD in the drive when running the screensaver. "
