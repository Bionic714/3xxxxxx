,Shorty,2006-09-23T22:18Z,"This track is jsut great. Hope Nomeris mean that he doesn`t like and not the quality that sucks. Everymans opinion is different, but i like it:) Thx"
,kivrel,2006-09-30T13:09Z,ok..ok... This is radio-quality but thanks anyway.. I find it strange that no one has uploaded it in a ripped version.. One of the most sold singles in norway these days..
