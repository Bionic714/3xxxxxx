Day Of Phoenix are another fairly unknown Danish prog-rock / psych-rock band of the 70s that have an amazing musicality and quality about them. In Ole Prehn they had a guitarist of note who also had a great voice. These two albums on one CD come from 1970 and 1972 and are a real find for anybody with a liking for vintage 70s music of the progressive or psychedelic kind.
