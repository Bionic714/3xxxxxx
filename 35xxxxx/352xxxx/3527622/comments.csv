,kinglewuk,2007-10-10T11:01Z,"why on earth would you ever need the quality of a song to be so great that 1 album takes up 300mb!!! unless you have your own recording studio you will never, ever hear the difference.  really, honestly 320kb/s is the absolute maximum and 128kb/s will be more than enough for 90% of the sound systems (don't kid yourself and think the Bose computer speakers are really that good, i'm talking ÂŁ50,000+ systems) please seed at a reasonable bit rate so it doesn't take a month to download an album, you never know maybe more people will seed "
,Vishnu,2007-11-19T11:09Z,"thanx for flac, dudenas! When someone doesn't hear the difference between 128kb/s and a nice flac he can't be helped :) "
,topic58,2008-04-13T12:07Z,Huge HUGE difference between mpeg3 and flac
,topic58,2008-04-13T13:05Z,pls seed
,dirtyscum,2008-10-08T16:52Z,"Thanks man! Will seed for at least a month when I get this.

Oh, and when someone can't hear the difference between 320kpbs MP3 and 128kpbs MP3 and thinks that BOSE is the shit, they should be shot in the fucking nuts.

How would I know? 6 plus years working as a professional sound engineer, that's how.

,dirtyscum,2008-10-08T17:03Z,"Whoops typo. *Kbps
And I meant the difference between FLAC, MP3 320kbps and MP3 128kbps.

Anyway, you're still a douche bag Kinglewuk. Kindly return to the year 2000."

[H],politux,2010-03-05T15:21Z,"Oh no!  Not a 300 megabyte album!  That might take up .0001% of my storage space! WAAAAA.

But seriously folks, FLAC and mp3 at any bit rate are not even in the same universe.  Long live FLAC!"
,JamesT67,2010-04-09T00:56Z,"I'm all for high quality files, but I can't play .flac's on my iPod... so long live 320k mp3's!

Thanks for the torrent."
,burrit0z,2011-02-06T16:46Z,Download and downconvert it into mp3. Appreciate that it's in lossless you fucking idiots. It's something called choice DERP
,head1ess1973,2011-03-22T14:56Z,"I have a basic pc setup flacs rule as nice to have the original & convert down for portable etc!

however I get more static on flacs (prior to conversion) is that just showing flaws in my audio set up or what?????

cheers for up BTW"
