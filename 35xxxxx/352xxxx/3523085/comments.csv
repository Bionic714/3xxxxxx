,pcastell,2007-07-10T19:32Z,"requirements:
  intel mainboard and chipset
  cpu: any processor that support SSE2 and SSE3 extensions (it should work with only SSE2, but some applications may fail)
  video: ati / nvidia / intel 915g (or any other recent intel IGP)

on windows you can check your hardware with lspci, and your cpu instruction set with cat /proc/cpuinfo (take a look at flags list)

you can found more info here: http://www.osx86.theplaceforitall.com/howto/ and here http://www.osx86project.org/ and you probably like this too: http://www.x-devian.com

hope this help.

,ph00x,2007-10-20T02:00Z,"For everyone asking if this is English or Spanish MacOS X: MacOS is localizable in any language through free in-OS downloads via SoftwareUpdate. It's not like Windows, where you need to buy the localized version from the get-go.

Point: even if this is Spanish, it doesn't matter, just download the English localization in SWU."
,ParadiseKiss,2008-08-28T13:49Z,"hi dude.. i want to know if this runs on my computer

,PROTEOUS271158,2010-06-01T08:23Z,"Works great! Me GUSTU!!!
Thank you very much.
Anybody know how to update to 10.4.11? 
I had 10.4.11 installed but made the mistake of trying to install the very last security update(Intel) and it killed it. Then i realised my disk was missing for install and it's disappeared from all the sites I've checked.
My Specs:An old Intel D915PGN Board
                         Pentium4,3.8Ghz
                         with see2,see3,EMT64
                         3GB Ram
                         GeForce9500GT-1GB
I've got a shitload of games and software for older macs and hate the thought of throwing all that money down the drain because the new systems are purposely made incompatible to get us to waste or hard earned wages while providing a high tech billboard for the tons of adverising you see.
Thanks again !  "
