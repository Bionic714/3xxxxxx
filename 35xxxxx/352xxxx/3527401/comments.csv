,Panodilo,2006-09-21T21:49Z,Thanks for this convenient fantastic upload. If I was eleven I'd use words like awesome and rad.
,legendary_goku,2006-09-21T22:21Z,thx for this man! alot! one question is this compatible with fs9.1? thx :)
,DaftHonk,2006-09-22T01:31Z,"From the FS Global website:

Will the FS2004 patch (FS9.1) affect  FSGlobal?

NO, not at all. You can install the patch over an existing FSGlobal 2005 installation as well as install FSGlobal 2005 after you have applied the patch. The result will be the same. "
,blankbox,2006-09-22T03:11Z,"What is the advantage over...

http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3298146/Global_Terrain_Mesh_for_Flight_Simulator

over 1700 downloads of this (yeah I'm one) so what is this new one buying us?"
,rrodger99,2006-09-22T08:10Z,"That other does not cover all of the world....parts of Sweden & the Netherlands are not covered & some other areas I cannot remember.

I have this installed (all parts) along with UT Canada, USA & Europe...most of the sceneries posted here & GE pro & have had no issues other than it takes 5 minutes for my now 85gb+ install to initialize.

But once it does....wow.

I noticed a good increase in fps from the other package too as this is a bit more optomized."
,hirstey,2006-09-22T14:10Z,"Nice one Daft, cheers"
,David-7237,2006-09-22T15:08Z,"gr8

but... I have this FSG and ASV6, FE, GE and others... now, are they too much together? like they all install textures for the sky and ground... wich one works...

req.

1- FS2Crew 747  dying to get it"
,allen_x,2006-09-22T19:33Z,thanks simmer friend.
,rrodger99,2006-09-23T06:26Z,"David,

My load issues all pertain to the massive overkill on scenery addons that I have installed.

It's bad enough that my add/remove programs will no longer populate due to the number of installations I have.

Once it is loaded...everything runs fine.

As far as what you are running at start...the only thing I would get rid of is Flight Environment...it's a great program but with GE Pro & AS6 it serves little purpose. I got FS water which gives you the same water textures found in FE but takes a lot less space. I also use the sky & clouds from AS6."
