Could you put episode 22 in a single torrent, its the only one I haven't got.
So, thanks a lot..."
,RavenE,2008-03-27T18:00Z,"SmoothJay: You can choose what you want to download, so just download E22. ;)"
,SmoothJay,2008-03-27T20:43Z,"Really? Didn't know that and don't know how. A little help would be great.
The torrent claims to be episode 1-21, and I haven't been able to find any torrent with episode 22."

Submitter says the subs are optional, meaning they are not hardcoded."

In most torrent programs you can check/uncheck the files to download in the torrent. If your program supports this you can usually do this when asked where to save the files.
You can let some files (or just the onces you want) be checked and download that. If the torrent is too big you can burn to DVDs or watch on computor, then delete the files from your harddrive. Open your torrentprogram again and mark the torrent. Go to torrent settings, uncheck the already downloaded files and check others for download. And so on until you have all the files you want."
