,elba00,2008-07-10T20:41Z,"Thanks, I've just finished downloading. Should I unrar the files one by one to a directory and then add to the scenery library? 
Isn't it supposed to be a sequence? (like you click on a rar and that opens and extracts all other rars in the sequence??) I guess I need help..somebody!"
