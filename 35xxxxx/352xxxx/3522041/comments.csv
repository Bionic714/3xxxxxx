so, what is it? what should I do?"
,crackheadfrommars,2006-10-05T13:51Z,hmm... that's strange cuz it worked for me. have u tryed to uninstall and reinstall winrar.
,czzchen,2006-10-05T18:05Z,"yes, actually I did. but still no hope, anyone had the same problem like mine? please help, it took 4 days for me to download this, and I did it twice, still not working, I don't want to just delete it .... :("
,czzchen,2006-10-05T18:15Z,would that because my winrar is english version that might be different to the one used by uploader to split the file? :( just a guess
,Lanix,2006-10-05T22:22Z,"This sequal sucks it's so fucking sick! There's about 5-10 min of special effects. The rest is just lame actors fighting with an ""invisible"" guy."
,czzchen,2006-10-07T14:03Z,"I've figured out my problem, for those who tried to help, thanks a lot. and for those who still have the same problem as mine, try this:

right click the 001 file, click ""Extract files"", in the winrar dialog box, choose the ""keep broken files"" box, then after it extracts the file, the .img file will remain, the movie is perfectly playable, although with those strange winrar's CRC warnings. :(

well, I've viewed the movie, not too bad for me, just something for killing the time ;)"
,atarilover,2006-10-17T11:22Z,"can somebody do an xvid?
would be quicker to download!"
,Warren,2006-10-29T09:40Z,Thanks ! Works fine for me.
,Mercoun,2006-11-20T22:32Z,"Rightclick on R001 and extract to.. where you want to, it will soon appear as an IMG file, put the name .iso and then burnn it as DVD (UDF) in nero, and there will come up compilation that will burn it as IMAGE, that is correct press "
,Blata_k,2008-03-29T13:15Z,"99,4%."
,godaremat,2008-09-19T16:41Z,Anyone got this with Swedish subs who can make it available? All the ones here simply stops downloading at 99%...
