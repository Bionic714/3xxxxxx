,VaderHader,2006-11-29T15:08Z,"if you don't mind the hiss of cassette tape this is quite enjoyable.  I have only gotten through the first book so far, but the reader is pretty good, and the story is even better than I remember from when I was in junior high."
,andymac3431,2007-10-10T05:33Z,This will not start. Can somebody please seed?
,odran888,2008-03-09T17:35Z,"I just finished these and made a copy for my dad.  Thank you for taking the time and posting these.  The hiss is just because it's from a tape recording.  Ugh, who buys unabridged CDs for audiobook?  You'd be switching every hour.  These are fantastic."
