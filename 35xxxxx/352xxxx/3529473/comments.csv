Mr Meskalin appears to be so misinformed he doesn't even understand that Alex Jones (whose Web-site he links to) shares the same position as Johan Norberg.  I've followed both for many years.  Both believe in individual freedom, and therefore capitalism and free trade.  Alex Jones runs an oft-discredited show that is 20% truth and 80% baseless fear-mongering to sell water filters and other ""prepper"" gear (not that there's anything wrong with being prepared).  What AJ vocally opposes is a socialist world government - which I and Johan Norberg are also against.  

Globalization, capitalism, and free trade is what happens when tyrannical governments get out of the way!"
