This is for 1.31 only - You need to run the update yourself


After having some trouble with my purchased copy of GALCIV 2 playing it on 3 different location and since there is no fixed exe i decided to make it myself.

I'm by no means an expert in this kind of things and i only tested it on my personal pc .. it works well for me should work for you aswell.


This game *really* deserves your support.
I urge you to download this only if you play on multiple pc or the activation doesn't work for you, in any other case buy your copy is well worth it !

If this doesn't work for you i'm sorry but i can't support it.. so i recommend you backup your .exe before overwriting

Please seed after you've downlaoded for as long as you can
