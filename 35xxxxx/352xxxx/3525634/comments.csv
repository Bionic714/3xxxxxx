,myopenpirateaccount,2006-09-20T04:36Z,Anyone tested this yet besides the poster?
,peter980,2006-09-20T19:24Z,worked for me...
,redly,2006-09-20T23:12Z,"Is this REALLY an exe for 1.31? I don't see any of the new difficulty levels mentioned in the changelog notes to 1.31....Such as ""dunce"" or ""godlike"" or ""ultimate"", and a lot of other features I didn't see in the game. And yes, I was able to download the update and use this file. Says ""1.31"" in the corner but this could just be a hack job from 1.2"
,redly,2006-09-20T23:42Z,"Okay, nevermind, the new difficulty levels are new AI levels, not actual game levels. And I verified a few other things as well. This is the real deal.

Many thanks, this is a GREAT game."
,grim_marmazet,2006-09-21T14:35Z,"When I used this exe the game just tells me its ""too big to fit in memeory"" everytime I start it."
,peter980,2006-10-27T23:45Z,"Btw, patch 1.4 has arrived.
Anyone planned to crack it?"
