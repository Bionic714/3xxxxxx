,borgsta,2006-09-23T01:57Z,"Is this 360 or just normal Xbox?

I tried copying to the HDD and it didnt work.  Any one got any suggestions?"
,borgsta,2006-09-23T02:05Z,"Oh btw I should have mentioned.  When i extracted the file it has a folder called vcdata and all the file names are '0', '1' all the way up to 9.  

I've never seen anything like that before.  Is it right?"
