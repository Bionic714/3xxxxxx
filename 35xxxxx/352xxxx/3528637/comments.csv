I mostly wanted ""Ein Kleines Bisschen Horrorschau"", but i'll thanksfully take the rest too.

btw. it's really from 1988. It was made as the soundtrack from a musical of Anthony Burgess' ""Clockwork Orange"", which also also turned into a movie by Stanley Kubrick.

Make sure to read the book or at least watch the movie."
