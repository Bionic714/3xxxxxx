fantastic commentary, I must SCREAM   ""HAIL  THE
MESSIAH!"".   However, if you're just another 
geezer (like me) who's doing his best to gather together  all the songs he ever thought well of, 
then I've only got one question:   !WHERE THE FUCK DID YOU FIND A GEM LIKE THIS ONE?

Thanks, anyway, whoever you are, for making my bloody day. The wife would wring my neck
if she could see this, which is part of the reason
why I think it's   ""so beautiful""  to quote the subject matter"
