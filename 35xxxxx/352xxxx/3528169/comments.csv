,arnold1965,2006-09-23T14:48Z,"Note the different changes in the subtitles:

This has been requested from friends from my homeland.. This a classic if you've never seen them..

Yep - I'm not from Euorpe or USA but ""NEW ZEALAND""

Surprised? *laughs*

ENJOY!!!"
,fowler35,2006-09-23T16:45Z,Thanx a million
,arnold1965,2006-09-23T16:48Z,"@fowler35 

No worries mate.. You won't see these around much longer, so take them while you can..

NZ has brought out some awesome movies..

These 2 made in NZ , The Lord of the rings. King Kong and Whale rider.. A few others but these have made it big around the world..."
,Specials,2006-09-24T10:06Z,"What do you mean ""This has been requested from friends from my homeland""? The Danish people are not worthy enough for the subtitles or what?"
,arnold1965,2006-09-24T10:11Z,"Specials:

First: I'm from New Zealand and my friends in New Zealand wanted me to upload this for them.

Second:

Has nothing to do with being worthy or not..
You can actually get the Danish subtitles and add them yourself, or any lanuage in that matter.
You should feel lucky that subtitles exist..

,arnold1965,2006-09-29T10:00Z,"DustyMemphis:

Obviously you didn't read my first comment, or didn't read anything right, so if you are SO worried about danish subtitles for this movie, you can add you own. 
You can get the danish subtitles from here:

Try reading the comments first and try looking for the danish subtitles before posting a comment.."
