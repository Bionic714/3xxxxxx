,pelle987,2006-10-03T14:05Z,"Thx for a great upload!

I however have one big problem! U've probably heard this question a tousand times before but how the heck do you use the CUE-files! I've NEVER got em to work for me. I've used deamon nero and loads of other programs to try and burn the cd's with separated trax but i never manage to get it to work.

Do you need any special program or version of nero or deamon to get it to work?

Would really apriciate if anyone could help me with this!

thx!"
