To those who get error message, ""Please insert Disk"", you have to open the winrar file, go to RELOADED, then to Crack folder and copy all the files EXCEPT the .nfo to your BF2 folder in your Program Files. When it asks to replace the files, click ""Yes to All"". Then boot the game and it should work."

Does anybody have an idea what the problem might be? Please PM me!
Thanks! :-)

Tjena folket! =)
Jag har ett problem gällande Battlefield 1942. Jag har lagt in cracken i spelets mapp, men när jag försöker starta upp spelet så kommer den där ""Skicka felrapport"" - ""Skicka inte"" rutan som dyker upp när ett spel eller program stöter på något fel eller liknande. Någon som har den blekaste vart felet kan ligga? Skicka PM, tack!

,Cerberus(),2008-03-24T00:05Z,hmmm a fake torrent.....ull be booted
,RainbowDissent,2008-03-28T16:53Z,"This is how you install this;

1. Download the file (duh).

2. Use a program like DAEMON Tools (http://www.daemon-tools.cc/dtcc/download.php) to mount the .iso file. If you are using DAEMON Tools, you need to do is open the program, right-click on the icon in the system tray, go to Virtual CD/DVD-ROM, go to Device 0: [X:], click 'Mount image' and find the file you downloaded. Simple. Alternatively, burn the .iso file to a DVD using Nero or a similar program.

3. You should get the Battlefield 2 setup screen; just click Install.

4. It'll ask you for a CD key. To get these, open the Battlefield 2 .iso file (you need WinRar or WinZip), go to the RELOADED folder and double-click the file bf2_serials.txt. When it opens, pick one of the CD keys and put them in.  Make sure you pay attention to the difference between the letter 'O' and the number zero; the first serial has a zero, the second and fourth have Os and the third has neither. Continue with the installation.

5. Go through the rest of the installation (microphone settings, DirectX license, shortcuts etc.). 

6. Do NOT restart your computer when prompted. Instead, go back to the RELOADED directory in the .iso file. Extract the RELOADED folder anywhere you want, then copy-paste the CoreDLL.dll and BF2.exe files from the Crack folder inside it into the directory you installed Battlefield 2 into (default is C:\Program Files\EA GAMES\Battlefield 2). Select 'Yes to All' when it asks if you want to overwrite the files. 

7. Restart. 

8. Play!

Hopefully that's simple enough for everybody. The game works 100% perfectly for me installed like that, if you're having problems you're likely either doing something wrong or there's a problem with your machine."

Then I scrolled down and opened the folder entitled RELOADED.  Then I opened the folder entitled CRACK.  Then I dragged the folders entitled ""BF2"" and ""Core.dll"" (these are in the CRACK folder, and NOT the ones you already deleted) into the C:/Program_Files/EA_Games/Battlefield_2.  Whenever you want to start the game, you have to mount the disk on Daemon (or whatever program you use) and click on the BF2 icon that's in C:/Program_Files/EA_Games/Battlefield_2.

Basically you patch the game to 1.4 and then again to 1.5. Import the cracked server list from EPC gaming to Qtracker and connect to a server. Theres about 25 active servers atm. Once the game is patched to 1.5 you dont need the crack since theres no CD check."

After patching to v1.5, make sure BF2.exe is run as an administrator, and you won't encounter black-screen/ctd.

You can torrent a BF2 installer already patched to 1.5 which doesn't require a crack to run...enter in TPB's searchbox ""BF2 1.5""

,fuzdemon,2011-11-11T20:48Z,"This worked for me:

1) install game
2) copy core.dll to bf2 installation folder (NOT THE BF2.EXE CRACK)
3) download bf2 mini image and daemon tools
4) mount the bf2 image
5) click the bf2.exe to start game
6) if you get any problems change your computers and bf2's in game refresh rate to 60hz"
,fuzdemon,2011-11-11T22:03Z,7) download and install punkbuster updater.

,lilome,2012-05-03T17:29Z,"FOR THOSE WHO ARE HAVING PROBLEMS OPENING THIS.
Even though it's an ISO file 
 Use ChattChitto's WinRAR to open this ISO file.
(default installation settings it will open it)

http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7049129/WinRAR_x86_%2832_bit%29_v4.11_Final___KeyReg_%5BChattChitto_RG%5D 

I opened this with both PowerArchiver & Win-RAR & got 2 totally different openings.
Some extraction programs may open it up completely and you will have hundreds of files to sift through, So save the headache, & open the files the way they are suppose to be "" USE WIN-RAR! "" 
The CRACK file & key-codes are in the folder called ""RELOADED""
 ***AFTER THE INSTALLATION**
Go into the the folder where you have installed the game then remove the "" BF2.exe  & CoreDLL.dll "" then replace them with the ones in the crack folder.  Make a copy of the cracked BF2.exe & put in on the desktop in place of the original 
GOOD HUNTING!"
