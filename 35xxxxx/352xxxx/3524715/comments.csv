[T],stevekasian,2006-09-16T01:05Z,"Gay. I heard this dumbass who made the thing interviewed on TV today, and in 5 minutes of talkingandtalkingandtalkingandtalking, he said absolutely nothing.

Reporter: ""Why would you make a game like this?""
'Artist': ""Well, I think that's it's important to foster understanding about why this happened, because due to all the scapegoatism, the real reasons haven't been addressed.""

Reporter: ""So, what IS the understanding that people can gain from playing this game?""

'Artist': ""Well, it's important that people come away from it with understanding and insight - and my condolences to the familys of the victims in Montreal, and I think video games are important tools - now more important than ever before - and people should take a close look at...""

Reporter: ""So, what exactly is it that people are going to find when they take a close look and play the game?""

'Artist': ""Well, it's very important that there be a dialog and an understanding about these things, for which we condemn these two shooters by the way...  I think it's important that we gain some insight...""

WTF??  This fool graduated from Columbine - that explains it. The problem, then, is obviously Columbione... right?   or no?  Wait a minute. I'm confused. Ok, I think it's time for some dialog and understanding and for me to put my hand back up my ass again for a while and feel around for the answers...

,I_Rule,2006-09-19T14:22Z,"This game is intended for those that want to create a full profile on the Montreal killer in order to understand the true reasons behind this tragedy. People who are not content to fall back to a simplistic: ""he was just another maniac"".

I certainly do not condone in any way the actions of the killer and I will certainly not accept criticism by people who promote Nazism."
,GYMMY,2006-09-19T23:30Z,Who the hell cares about Montreal and Kimveer Gill? It's about time someone in Canada went postal. As for this torrent...seems to be dead.
,nitedrive,2006-09-28T01:27Z,"Intended for those who want a full profile,yeah,sure...^^,I know few people understand the word respect nowadays,but try to be decent and ignore crap games like this one."
,Ola435345345,2007-07-03T18:35Z,"Everyone let us just report this torrent and have It removed. Ok someone was idiotic enough to even think ofv making that game, but do I have to just accept everything I see just because of.. just because of what? The word ""freedom"" Is the most misused word thers days so don@t tell me there Is any issue about ""freedom"" of speech/publishing etc etc. Report this torrent ! I will do It right now.."
