""Error 1331: A file that is required cannot be installed because the cabinet file D:\star wars\Defaul~1.cab has an invalid digital signature. This may indicate that the cabinet file is corrupt.""

Is this a problem with my disc having a folder D:\Star Wars? Should all the files in the \star wars folder just be copied to the disk instead of the folder itself...?

I'm going to go burn another just to find out.

But if anyone can help, I'd appreciate it."
,mullhippiar,2006-09-26T16:42Z,"I Have the same problem, and if i cant get it working until friday, my friend will not buy it, and i will loose 15$ :P So please help us"
,mediccody,2006-09-26T21:10Z,"Alright, I solved the issue stated in my previous post.

The only problem is that you need to put all of the files out of the ""star wars"" directory directly on the CD, without the ""star wars"" directory.

For instance, if E is your CD drive, you want to be able to run E:\Autorun or E:\Setup

You DO NOT want to try and run E:\star wars\Autorun or E:\star wars\Setup

Once you have a data disc without the /star wars/ directory, you can run setup. It will seem like it is hung up on the first file, but give it a few minutes, and it will install.

And then you go to C:\Program Files\LucasArts\Lego Star Wars II, backup the original LegoStarWarsII and LegoStarWarsII_win2k .exes and then replace them with the files of the same name in the crack folder on your data disc.


Long enough description for ya?"
,monstro,2006-09-29T06:43Z,Thanks Mediccody your tip really helped great game!!
,coffin.filler,2006-09-30T01:26Z,Thanks dave. Gettin this one 4 the kids and its comming suuuuuper fast @ a avarage speed of 160KB/s. (Im only on a 1MB connection but this goes to show the benifits of having this many seeders which is 55 to only 30 leechers).

,taris229,2006-10-12T17:51Z,"ok, i'm really stuck on what to do, i just finished downloading it, i keep getting errors saying ' re-installing might fix the problem' and 'insert the star wars cd' i tried the setup and i don't know what to do with the crack. There's loads of questions going on in my head like 'do you HAVE TO burn it onto a cd?'. can sumone explain to me in detail what you have to do

thx for all you're help if you do "
,taris229,2006-10-14T17:43Z,ok i think i know the problem it's either 'do you have to burn all the files onto a disc to make the game work?' or its that i have exactly the same files in my crack folder as i do in the star wars/program files/lucasarts/lego star wars II folder  (LegostarwarsII and LegostarwarsII_win2k)
,NCC2824,2006-10-16T01:51Z,"For those that didn't get the first explanation here it is again: uncompress the lego starwars .rar archive. this will give you a folder named star wars. inside that is another starwars folder containing all the stuff. remove all files from folder and burn to disk (don't uncompress the defaul~1 .rar as the cab file will do this auto) the disk you burnt should now auto run and install WARNING IT IS SLOW but it does work. when the install is complete delete the desktop shortcut, go into the game folder on your pc and remove the two .exe files (vaders head icon) replace them with the two .exe files in the crack folder that came with the download. the crack files are twice the size of the origionals so you can't mix em up. create a new shortie for the .exe you want (one is for win2000 the other for the rest) and play away."
,forteZX,2006-10-16T03:58Z,can't get it to work it said No cd or when i start the game the screen goes black to white and i get a message saying there was a problem starting up must close. so what do i do to play the game. step by step instructions please.
,sepiwirl,2006-10-17T14:46Z,"So i got it all working (for those who cant= REETARDS) and when im off to play the first mission, when u have to open the door with 2 levers, it all crashes ! what's up with that?, pretty annoying :P"
,taris229,2006-10-17T18:11Z,"a question for NCC2824,  I ran the setup without creating a data disc, it all went fine but when i try to run the game form the desktop shortcut it says insert the original star wars cd, is this because i haven't created a data disc?"
,black francis,2006-10-18T05:21Z,"omg you people... you can download torrents, but you can't explore the contents of the disc in your dvd/cd rom.... if you are so stupid to have autorun enabled all you need to do is to right click on the dvd/cd drive in which the disc is in and select explore from the drop down menu... this explores the contents of the disc instead of running it. and every time you double click the drive it will autorun, hence the phrase ""autorun"". If you can't work this out now you will be shot, parted and each part of you will be sent in opposite directions throughout the universe so that such genes which you possess will never live to be so stupid again... ever."

As stated before.

Unrar to hard drive, it will create its own folder.

I found the burning to disk did not work for me, so i install straight from the files it unrar'ed.

Then just cut and paste the crack and you are good to go.

any probs i will report back.

I'm seeding this for at least 7 days only took two hours to get.

have fun.
