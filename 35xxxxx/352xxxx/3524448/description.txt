Sorry No Subs, that's how it came on the DVD. 

Extra Features were removed, Video quality is untouched. 

This is a great Canadian indie film that you probably would have never came across anywhere else unless you live here or vist thePirateBay :)  



"Lucid is a psychological thriller with a twist ending, a genre on the rise in mainstream film since The Sixth Sense surprised everyone at the box office in 1999. Garrity?s indie habits die hard, though; for every genre marker he sets up, he knocks another over. Lucid relies on off-kilter dread rather than outright horror, dallies with sexual awkwardness rather than noir sexiness and always preserves a thin, dark edge of comedy."
