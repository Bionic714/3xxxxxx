,JulkaJulka,2006-09-26T18:54Z,Anyone tested with PPC?
,GordonM,2006-10-01T12:45Z,keygen does not work per the instructions and actually has what looks like a typo in it...
,fortuno,2006-10-05T07:56Z,"Keygen does work for the PalmOS devices.  Again, I don't have a PPC so I cannot test.  I'm not sure about the details of the instructions but it's pretty simple to use.

Step 1: Copy program TT6_kg_4_C4Pda.exe (the keygen) to the USA_and_Canada folder
Step 2: Run the keygen with the parameter of USA_and_Canada.mid; TT6_kg_4_C4Pda.exe USA_and_Canada.mid.
Step 3: The keygen will ask for a Device ID.  The DeviceID is obtained by going through the TomTom manual activation process.
Step 4: The keygen will give you the activation code and you need to enter that exactly in the TomTom, including the spaces."
,fortuno,2006-10-11T20:48Z,"Yes, this is one map of the USA including Canada and Alaska.  You'll also need a 1GB memory card to hold the files."
,dryden2k3,2006-11-02T16:56Z,"I downloaded this for use on a NavMan icn520, and i have an operational version of TomTom 6.010, and these maps worked on my unit without problem! They didn't even require an activation code,

So i've tested it on a PPC and it works fine, i think i'm running a version of CE 4.20 (Build 1088).

This is one (922mb) file for the USA and Canada, and it DOES WORK!!!

Thanks guys, great work!"
,sirbob_selasor,2006-11-14T12:47Z,"Downloaded the maps couple of times, but having problem when extracting to my disk. I get messages like due to bad CRC or Unknown methods error messages using WinRAR.

I'm using uTorrent client.

Is the copy corrupted or I did something not right? Any ideas folks?"
,Meispantyshot,2006-11-18T05:22Z,The map works fine on version 6.0. Tested it on my iQue M5 with 2003SE.
,huib007,2006-11-18T08:56Z,"Card is working perfectly on Tomtom 6.010 (PDA version) 

Unfortunately the code created by the keygen is not working on a tomtom one V2, not for this map or for other (downloaded) maps"
,waytoca,2006-12-23T20:01Z,"the is working fine on WM5 PPC, any one can help me where can download the voices file of TomTOM?"
,Symbian,2006-12-31T02:15Z,Work fine on my TT One II! Thanx

,lechp,2008-01-27T20:08Z,"I have tested TomTom_USA&Canada on HTC P3300. works marvelous. Device ID: AADZN C53AS
Activation code : DW8JR BGG3B VT5KS
You have only to copy unpaced directory USA_and_Canada to card where you have tomtom maps"
,hawkinsj,2008-07-05T07:39Z,"what program do you use to extract a .DAT file?
I can't extract the program after unzipping it"
,niviuk,2009-11-28T13:50Z,"Works like a charm! Just copy/past it to the SD card were the other maps are & Presto!

No need for keygen when applying to working TomTom on PDA."
