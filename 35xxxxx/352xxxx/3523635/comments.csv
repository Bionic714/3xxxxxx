,volpoid,2006-09-22T18:33Z,"Hi, Just installed Pacman World 3 with no problems. I'm using Alcohol 120% too to mount the iso image. 

  1. Unrar.
  2. Burn or mount with Daemon tools.
  3. Install the game. Use the keygen located in the Crack dir on the DVD or 
     any of these serials:

     B2KT-5SJ3-EEBL-WEE9-NRLD        D94C-5RAU-MJNB-NMJW-CRLD
     RPPP-6Z2W-XZ54-3XZ4-7RLD        PP3T-SGY6-8PB2-Q8P9-4RLD
     EPBT-SE49-9PD6-Q9PZ-7RLD        A7VM-QMPB-TUMQ-DTUN-SRLD

  4. Copy the cracked content located in the \Crack directory on the DVD 
     to your installation directory.
  5. Play the game.

(I used the keygen to install the game)
