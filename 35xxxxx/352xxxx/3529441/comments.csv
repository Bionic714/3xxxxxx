,AcidReflux,2006-11-23T05:27Z,"Don't be jealous, your food is terrible in the UK.

BLAND, BLAND, BLAND...."
,proudamerican,2007-03-14T15:09Z,"Ya Americans are obese just like the rest of the west ...
And you are jealous of Americans like the rest of the west (and world).
God Bless America!"
,fredomrepresthisohyeah,2007-04-07T11:05Z,"the brits talking about taste,what a thought,you have nicknames for dishes so you don't have to think about whats in them,only reason you are not fat is you don't have any teeth to chew with,etc...why don't you mellow out and quit putting others down !!!"
,psychlopath,2007-05-20T21:27Z,"Actually, it?s more like 80% of use are obese, with 60% of the into the morbid obesity range.  It comes with being successful, I guess, as even the ?poor? are typically over weight.  
According to http://ec.europa.eu/research/infocentre/rss/infocentre-rss.xml, only 40% of Europeans are obese.  Wonder what the difference is?.
To the chef guy: Where are all these wonderful places to eat there?  Not that I get out that much, but I?ve been to Italy and Germany?food was good..different?but not anything I?ll be packing up and leaving home for."
,Herofish,2007-05-27T18:13Z,americans are fat;). Good food though:P
,kn0xy,2007-06-09T09:21Z,Maybe Americans are fatter than the Brits simply because the Yanks have better Teeth? Just Saying.
,dwayne123,2007-07-03T10:35Z,its good to see what kind of crap fast food is made of
,Sirgul,2007-07-09T20:34Z,"Whats the thing about trashing americans,seems to me that people are mixing politics with pleasure,why trash americans when the most of them are kind and friendly people,just because their president sucks big time,does not give you the right to be rude towards americans.How about just saying thank you for a great cookbook.
It is so much fun being nice then rude ;-)"
,iou101,2007-08-20T22:40Z,"Hee Hee, all of you sound pretty dumb... lol, Thanks for the CookBook...  I wanna move to Canada... :)"

From the UK with love (& bad teeth and a small gut)"
,hayls,2008-03-14T09:34Z,"If we are all arguing that this is all american recipes - why is there Jamie Oliver recipes? 

And can kn0xy please explain how having nice teeth makes you fat? .......... I have nice teeth & I'm not fat... !

Doesnt matter what country you are in their will always be fat people & people with bad teeth, its just unfortunate that these people have not been educated on eating healthy (for weight & healthy teeth)."
,loveyourdaughter,2008-03-29T06:12Z,"someone put up a link for the awesome British food.
hahaha...

i've been all over england, the fuck tastes like shit, but the beer is superior.. :)"
,samg001,2008-05-12T02:05Z,"All of the 'great british chefs' were all trained in France. Outside of the 2 or 3 humans in the UK that can cook, the rest of the food is just sad."
,soggyorigami,2008-05-29T19:54Z,"Oh wow, these comments made me laugh. Thanks for the show guys."
,JakobY2K7,2008-07-05T22:52Z,"Tnx! this was a intressting torrent :P
Tnx again for shareing!"
,NightmarezESP,2008-07-13T09:20Z,"In my opinion:

Americans are fat: True
Americans are undereducated (in general): True
Under education or pay having to do with fat: False
Americans having poor government: True+
American food being bad or good: Pure opinion
Food anywhere else bad or good: Pure opinion

weather Iv eaten around the world or not(which i have not) Iv eaten a lot of kinds of food, and its not who its prepared by or from, its who eats it that makes the food good or bad. Some people like eating popcorn, some people like eating ants in its place.

If i were to say why people thing Europe has such ""bad"" food when their clearly americans complaning, its that we get used to premade prepackaged food. Be it sauces, pasta, bread, or anything else. Our FDA also overdramatizes public health issues making us change what food tastes like with preservitives ect.

If you want to blame americans being fat on something, blame it on them being largely lazy. If you want to blame other countrys food being poor blame it on:your fucking stupidity.

I'm an american, an anarchist american. I think the country can go to hell, but it has little to do with the food. Its the fucking ignorance like all these people fighting on why someone sucks and low shots that makes humans fucked. (for instance picking on usa being fat or brits having bad teeth. its person to person, don't minoritize the majority.) "
,a0c8c,2008-08-05T01:34Z,"I'm not trying to defend american cuisine, but there's a reason why when I walked through London, there was nothing but foreign food.

Thanks for the cookbook, looks like alot of good recipes. Some of us looked past the fast food secrets section and actually found real recipes."
,gaby_pau,2008-09-05T23:22Z,"nice place to pick a fight, the comments column!
for the ppl who care about the actual torrent, the recipes are decent, not the greatest thing in the world imo but some things can be found, and it beats buying a cook book for only one recipe.."
,Gogeta421,2008-10-25T11:58Z,Lovley..sapose this would be the right spot to ask this question .(I hope)..but anyone rember when 7-11 nacho's were the bomb..not talkin bout squeeze pump but im talkin back in 89 when one might have to wait like 4 or 5 hrs for the chilli to cook?..I been looking everywhere to find out what kinda chilli and cheese they used..as they dont sell em like they they used to :(..any help out there?
,happybunny777,2008-12-09T05:42Z,Hi amflyer.  I was wondering if you guys can seed this again? Im stuck at 99.8.  Thanks for the upload.
,aser103,2009-01-29T18:34Z,thanks for the upload I will sure enjoy some new foods...thanks amflyer...
,Demonyca,2009-04-24T10:47Z,"HI
Thanks so much for this... Thanks for taking the time to upload...
To the poster who said that London is mostly foreign food, my question to you is this: how many recipes are completely American? I think that fighting over food is silly for one and second, so everyone can rest easy, right now there are very few cuisines that have not been influenced by another so relax...
People are overweight because they don't cook any more at home, the buy uberprocessed junk that is full of additives because corporations want to make money. It's that simple... And people, it's not just in America... Take a look at the eastern european countries where up until a few years ago there wasn't even a mention of obesity but now it's on the rise.
So let's just all get along and cook some good food ;)"
,raindr0ps,2009-06-19T01:55Z,"I uploaded Cast Iron Cookbook 320 Recipes.exe to:

Virus Total scanned the file with 39 different virus programs and Comodo Antivirus is the only one that reported the virus. 
I also sent Ebook-Insiders Recipes...exe to Virus Total and the same 39 virus scanners reported NO problems at all."

,raindr0ps,2009-08-29T03:52Z,"I have many, many of these cookbooks but there are a few I'd like to have that I don't. Will I download 1.29 gigs for a half dozen of these? Of course not. Why pack into a single file or two? Since they are already compressed (PDF) what was saved? "
,krazyowner,2009-12-17T03:39Z,Thanks Great speed for a pubic site
