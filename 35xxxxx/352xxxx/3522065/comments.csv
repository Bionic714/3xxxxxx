,Guffen99,2006-09-11T09:38Z,Keygen infected by Infostealer.Banpaes (Symantec Antivirus 10.1.0.394)
,Telavag,2006-09-24T21:20Z,"Virus inside, be carful."
,vanTorX,2006-09-25T03:50Z,"Bitdefender also reports that but it might still be false positive?

suppose one runs the keygen in sandbox PC or something like that?"
,Krillbert,2006-11-01T09:55Z,"Don't  waste your time to download this shit
If you call yourself KongKong, what do u expect?

Either has he not a decent virus program or he is just here trying to infect. He should be banned"
,ion_storm,2006-12-16T07:20Z,"If You don't know yet, more and more antiviruses become to state that there are viruses when You start keygens. Yes, as You can guess it's all politics.  It's up to You to deside if You believe 'em or not. For me CORE's releases are OK. My antivirus also says that there is a virus when I start a keygen. I start it anyway, do what I have to do and after that I start a full scan. And YES, the fuckin antivirus finds nothing. So i'm pretty convinced that this is all politics between soft developers."
,ion_storm,2006-12-16T07:24Z,The fuckin morons decided to fight piracy with fear. And as I see it works sometimes.
,michalisnik,2007-01-16T14:31Z,I had this feeling when a Windows Activation Tool for XP2 become a virus some monts ago... Best thing to do is to check for the reported behaviour of the virus/trojan and see if there is actually a description. Sometimes you will notice that there are fake positives (signaled as viruses but with absolutely no effects!!!) 
,KiNgKoNgX,2007-05-06T11:55Z,"lol, why the hell would i include a virus? this was from a scene ftp, originaly packed this way."
