Following the multi-platinum, worldwide success of their major-label
debut, Fallen, Evanescence is poised to build upon their respected
position in the rock community with their sophomore effort, The Open
Door, from Wind-up Records in stores October 3, 2006.

With what some call a meteoric rise to the top, Fallen brought the
Little Rock, Arkansas band to global success with 14 million records
in the hands of fans worldwide, two Top 10 singles, "My Immortal"
and "Bring Me To Life," two Grammy┬« Awards in 2003 (Best New Artist
and Best Hard Rock Performance for "Bring Me To Life"). Fallen spent
over one hundred weeks on Billboard Magazine's Top 200 chart, was
certified gold or platinum in over 35 countries Worldwide, and
supported sold-out arenas globally.

The Open Door was recorded in Los Angeles at The Record Plant in
early 2006 and mixed at the venerable Ocean Way Studios in March
2006. It includes the return of long-time friend and producer Dave
Fortman (Mudvayne, Bif Naked). The new album is an ideal showcase
for the band's inevitable personal and professional growth, with
songs of introspection, longing, doubt, self-respect and
ultimately, empowerment and anticipation. Several songs include a
choir, as well as strings recorded in an old chapel. The album is
defined by Amy Lee's beautiful melodies, profound lyrics, stunning
vocals and poignant piano, which fuse with Terry Balsamo's urgent,
yet intricate guitar playing, to form a remarkable, ethereal blend
perfectly rooted in the band's rock and classical sensibilities.

"The making of this record has been really intense, but I've come
out feeling purified," shared Lee. "I've grown so much since
'Fallen,' and Terry is the perfect writing partner -- I feel like
I've been lifted up to a whole new level of inspiration and
possibilities. After all the things we've seen over the past couple
of years, beautiful and tragic, in the end I'm really grateful. It
has made us create music I could not be more in love with."

Evanescence is Amy Lee (vocals, piano), Terry Balsamo (guitar),
John LeCompt (guitar), Will Boyd (bass) and Rocky Gray (drums).
Formed in the late '90s, Evanescence released two EPs and their
first full-length album, the much-sought-after Origin, which
included "My Immortal," on their own before finding a home at
Wind-up Records. Fallen, their major-label debut, was released in
April 2003 to critical and commercial success and is certified 6x
platinum. Anywhere But Home, their 2004 live DVD release, has sold
over 1 million copies. For more information, please visit
