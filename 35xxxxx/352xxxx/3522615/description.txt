Dispatches: Mad About Animals 
Channel 4


The animal liberation movement as you've never seen them before. Filming entirely 
openly for over a year, award-winning filmmaker David Modell won the confidence of 
leading activists, joining them on various operations, from the liberation of 
chickens to filming his own arrest with the man who planned the most extreme animal 
rights crime of recent years: the notorious grave-robbery in Newchurch. 

The activists talk candidly about what motivates their extremism, revealing a 
fundamentalist mindset fuelled by fantasies of animal abuse.  Dispatches lays bare 
the passions, the politics and the mindset driving the extremists.

David Modell is one of the most talented documentary makers in the UK. He was 
the man responsible for Young, Nazi and Proud, which exposed the racism that 
flourished behind the new-look BNP, and Keep Them Out!, which followed the campaign 
by local residents to prevent asylum seekers being housed in Lee-on-the-Solent. By 
giving people a platform and listening patiently to what they have to say, Modell 
mercilessly exposes them for what they are.
