Folque - Kjempene pa Dovrefjell (1975 Norwegian Folk-Rock - 320 kbps)

Second album from 1975, by this Norwegian folk rock band who did for traditional Scandinavian music what Fairport, Trees etc did for English folk. Fabulous electric folk music with guitar, fiddle, male/female harmony vocals and stunning production. The vocals are in Norse but the music is as good as you could possibly hope for from this genre. ? freakemporium.com
