Check out his website www.rense.com to see the kind of material he deals with. Please consider signing up to Jeff's website. If everyone just downloads the stuff for free from people like Jeff and Alex Jones and Greg Szymanski we risk loosing them altogether.  These people are really worth contributing to. "
