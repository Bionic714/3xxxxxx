,rcoolguy,2012-05-03T17:34Z,"I got it....
1. Use MagicISO or PowerISO to convert the .MDF file to .ISO format.
2. Use Daemon Tools to mount it.
3. Install (Cd KEY is Z79H-AJJ3-DKJA-AVDZ-6974)
4. Download crack from http://thepiratebay.se/details.php?id=3407973
5. Replace original .exe file with crack.
6. Run the game, it works."
,akinoga123,2012-07-21T12:24Z,"If anyone could not detect the file using Daemon Tools try to change the setting of the one showing the files into All files (*.*) (at the bottom right of the window)

Hope it works.

Also I haven't downloaded this torrent yet.

Sorry for the ones who do not understand me I'm bad in speaking in english"
