,lol12,2007-08-09T01:26Z,Use Daemon Tools or something like it to mount it on the virtual drive. Then it will play.
,retheldirood,2008-04-12T12:31Z,"It's worth mentioning that the ISO is 'hidden', so if you don't have your system set up to view hidden files you won't see the file, even though it's there.

Aside from that, it's great."
