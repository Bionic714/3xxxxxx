Never go online without the latest anti-virus protection. Fast-spreading mass-mailing viruses, worms and Trojans like Mydoom, Bagle and Sasser can easily infect exposed PCs over dial-up or broadband connections, forward themselves to your email contacts and even help remote hackers hijack personal information. 

That's why award-winning McAfee VirusScan-trusted by millions worldwide-automatically scans your email, attachments, shared disks and downloads, then immediately starts to clean or quarantine infections. Easy to download, install and use, McAfee VirusScan automatically checks for virus updates whenever you connect to the Internet, so your protection stays up-to-date against the latest threats, including spyware. Besides all the powerful features of VirusScan, VirusScan Pro includes a 2-user license (letting you protect a second computer), anti-spam protection, system cleanup tools and secure data erasure.
