Synopsis: With the once-feared wolfpacks reduced to 12 lone U-boats, Captain Lehmann-Willenbrock (Jürgen Prochnow) sets out once more to hunt allied shipping. Now it's a different story - German air support and intelligence is weak, and British destroyers seem to be everywhere - and no longer making mistakes. By 
sheer willpower, good seamanship and superhuman effort, the Captain and his crew manage to avoid constant attack and make it to secret harbor in Portugal. But how can they break through Gibraltar to get to their port in the South of France, with the allied Navy in such firm control?
