Everytime there is a bomb that goes off in iraq, there are a million other locations that none are going off, but no one wants to see those, they want the exciting stuff. "

We know how many are killed of our soldiers, it's reported on military lists, quite accurately, but we dont give up on people, and there are alot more good iraqi's than bad ones, and the good ones are the ones we're there for. we're losing a lot of money, we're paying in our blood as well as theirs, but thats ok. the good ones are worth it. Fallujah is quite peaceful now, dispite what happened before. control is being passed over slowly, but if they need us, we'll always be there for them. stop killing you r own people by these random attacks."

Thousands have died & thousands more will follow...for what? freedom of the Iraq people from a dictatorship? Cummon let's get real...we all know who the real dictator is...dont we?"
