+ RELEASE iNFORMATiON +
-----------------------
Senses Fail made their reputation the old fashioned way: they earned it. Perhaps
there is an easier, more glorious process than touring relentlessly to gain
fans, but that just wouldn?t suit the workhorses of Senses Fail. After releasing
a well-received EP, the band took their music to wherever an audience could be
found. Senses Fail?s driving emo and intelligent lyrics quickly found
appreciative fans. Their debut album Let It Enfold You only confirmed their
reputation as a scene heavyweight.
Worldly emotions swirl in Senses Fail?s taut music. This philosophical energy is
laid bare on The String Quartet Tribute to Senses Fail. Muscular rhythms and
frantic riffs are replaced with the evocative sounds of the violin, cello, and
viola, achieving new levels of emotion. These tender instrumental
interpretations are performed by some of the best string musicians. When you
want to cleanse your soul, let The String Quartet Tribute to Senses Fail enfold
you.
