,Seedforme,2008-06-09T19:44Z,"SEED MATE! SEED XD

I got a cd of the beginning I hate it, it won't start T.T"
,deadmano,2008-07-10T16:17Z,"I need help guys...

I downloaded the followings files with this torrent:

Populous the Beginning.iso
Populous Multiplayer Matchmaker
Populous the Beginning_Updatepatch
Populous Undiscovered Worlds_Addon
Populous Undiscovered Worlds-Updatepatch
And a website link...

Now when I extract the file 'Populous the Beginning.iso"" file with the winRAR extractor file and I run the setup in that folder I get the following error messages:

""Product_Name - entry not found in the string table.""

AND

""Failed to initialise File list""

AND

""Product_Name - entry not found in the string table.""

Then it runs the setup and says ""Welcome to the %P Setup program. This program will install %P on your computer.""

When I click Next it says the following:

""SETUPTYPE_STRING entry not found in the string table.""

AND

""In function 'SdSetupType':
Unable to create dialog.
Make sure the _ISRES.DLL is in
_SYS.CAB.""

Then it asks where to install the file and I tell it where to install...

Then I get the following error messages:

""Product_Name - entry not found in the string table.""

AND

""ERROR_UNINSTSETUP entry not found in the string table.""

AND Then a yellow exclamation warning with no text...

AND

""Product_Name - entry not found in the string table.""

""UNINSTALL_NAME entry not found in the string table.""

AND

""A division by zero was detected in the script.

Installation will continue.

Error 701.""

AND

""I_DATA_COPY entry not found in the string table.""

Then it installs till 1% and says: ""Click finish to complete setup.""

I really love this game, can anyone please help me make it work?

Thank's infront...

Deadmano.

,ParcoFolgorai,2008-12-04T14:14Z,"Sounds like it may be an incomplete or corrupt ISO. 

Our multiplayer client at http://mm.wildman-productions.org can download and install the game completely automatically."

I need help, please can someone give the steps of where I have to copy the pach file into

Thank you! "
,PinkHippo,2009-06-19T04:54Z,"Populous works in mysterious ways, but this file seems to work and in fact you'll have the same problem with a genuine CD as well.

For the problem with XP where the application doesn't seem to do anything after trying to run it and selecting software or hardware acceleration:

- Be sure to choose the complete install, instead of recommended or minimum. If you didn't, reinstall.

- Forget the no-cd patch here, download 1.03 patch instead (it has no-cd in it) and install it. (It may be a bit hard to find, but at this moment popre.net has a link for it at fileplanet, for which you'd need to register, or login with gamespy account.)

- Some say you'd need to run the game in hardware/Direct3D acceleration first. I don't know/remember, if that makes any difference, but I do it anyways just in case. That doesn't seem to work that smoothly for me however, so I'll later change back to software rendered one from the start menu or running hw_sw_select.exe

Hope that solves some problems. :)"
