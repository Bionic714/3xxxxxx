,kfact,2006-09-25T03:09Z,Those tracks were only included with the soundtrack CD. This is a game rip.
,Legojogge,2007-02-03T11:13Z,Nice thanks...I have been looking for ages (6 months) to get this.
,Kcarcamanno,2007-10-09T02:06Z,Seed Pliiiiiiiiiiiiz!
,generalbjartish,2007-10-20T22:42Z,Seed please! Need this one.
,snail19,2008-05-28T14:00Z,With only 7 seeders i thought this would download slow... Infact it downloaded at 75kbs (which for me is good). I will seed for a while as this music is amazing.
