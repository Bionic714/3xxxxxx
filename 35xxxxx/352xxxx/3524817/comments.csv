2. San Andreas dir must be renamed to GTA-SA
3. Copy the content from this dir ""ALWAYS_Copy content to Game dir"" to you GTA-SA dir
4. If your Games dir is on F:, copy the content from this dir ""Drive F_Copy content to Game dir"" to your GTA-SA dir
5. THE END

,The Rob,2006-12-27T00:38Z,using mod pack 2.2 - a lot of story missions are missing from modded mode and I can't get a gang or anything; is this the way modded mode is meant to be?
,Orangeoctave,2007-10-20T05:16Z,I'm confused after I got to a certain mission it stopped giving me missions to do.  I restarted the game several times to no avail.  Has anyone actually beat the game on modded mode?  If so can someone please send me the saved game file of the  modded version so I can play it.  My e-mail address is Orangeoctave@lavabit.com
