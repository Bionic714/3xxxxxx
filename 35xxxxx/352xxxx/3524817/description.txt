CONFESSION:
  -I now this MOD PACK looks pretty identical to some other GTA-SA MOD PACK,
   that is because this is actually that other MOD PACK, but there is a difference.
  -I have made a 99% new menu.
  -I use UnleashX as menu instead of EvolutionX.
  -This menu looks better and has only two options, normal and modded mode.
  -I have used the same loading-screen and modified the background a little.
