,ollliiisss,2006-10-14T20:06Z,"Hvor mange er dere Svensker i forhold til Amerikanerne og Britene?
Lærer dere ikke Engelsk på skolen i Sverige?
Lydbøker på Engelsk er forresten en glimrende måte å lære språket på."

,Prophet322,2007-04-07T00:51Z,where can i find the Ebook of thins
,Herendil2,2007-10-20T11:51Z,"There is something weird about the order in this book! File 7 starts with a voice that says chapter 4 and file 8 with a voice that says chapter 7! The rest has no chapters mentioned!
Is there anybody here who has listened through this book and know if it works correctly? 


Det är någonting skumt med ordningen i den här! Fil 7 börjar med en röst som säger kapitel 4 och fil 8 med en röst som säger kapitel 7! Resten har inga kapitel nämnda! 
Är det någon som har lyssnat igenom boken och vet om den fungerar som den ska eller inte? "
,suite99,2008-01-01T04:39Z,I doubt that enyone has gone through the whole thing yet. It has only been here since 2006.
,Beonaam,2008-01-06T06:19Z,Danke!

Har laddat upp ett kapitel från filen jag ladda ner, skulle flytta från en data till en annan, men där kan man lyssna.. 

peace"
,bObOtO,2008-01-17T00:45Z,"I have cross-checked with the e-book and the order is indeed jumbled up. The correct order of the mp3's is as follows: 

01-02-11-12-03-04-05-06-07-13-08-14-09-10

I haven't checked if all the mp3's are complete. They also don't seem to come from the same source of recording/ripping. However, all the other copies out there seem to be clones and have the same ordering mistake. I hope this clears up some confusion."

,rws,2008-06-20T07:13Z,"bObOtO, you're wrong, there is nothing wrong with the order of these files. I've compared the files with http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks01/0100021.txt myself. The chapters only seem funny because the book is divided into three parts..."
,Focus88,2008-06-30T00:03Z,Thanks! An absolute classic you know can enjoy in your car! Thank you very much!
,tsingshi,2008-08-23T19:11Z,"Yes, rws is correct. The book has three parts, so there is a ""Part 1, Chapter 1"" and ""Part 2, Chapter 1"" and even a ""Part 3, Chapter 1"". This is what causes confusion and the appearance of disorganized chapter order."
,VodkaLover,2008-08-26T19:04Z,Such an great novel thanks!
[T],CaptOmerta,2008-10-19T03:05Z,"THANKS!

Old George could never have imagined that our world will soon be MORE oppressed and controlled than his novel. "
,Djrock,2008-12-15T05:13Z,"Thanks so much for the torrent!

,comingupforair,2009-02-01T09:01Z,"Many thanks for this.

,TappaDouG,2009-02-06T18:00Z,BULLLSHIT was through it in less then 1 hour. Its missing alot. dont download. its shit trust me!!!!!!! more then half the files wont play!!!!
,Chjris,2009-04-08T17:30Z,"Tom78 - I can tell from your comment to CaptOmerta that you clearly only get your news from official / mainstream sources. But you have to remember these two very good quotes from Orwell.

""Early in life I had noticed that no event is ever correctly reported in a newspaper."" (I feel this is also true with televised news).

""Political language... is designed to make lies sound truthful and murder respectable, and to give an appearance of solidity to pure wind.""

Of course, this is only opinion and we all know one shouldn't make fact out of opinion, but I feel that it is true. . .and I'm sure millions of other people throughout the world feel this opinion is true also.

And who better to say it than someone who worked at the BBC??

And you can clearly see how much the mainstream media lie about the world we're living in by simply Googling ""30,000 scientists"" and think about how much the media call the UN IPCC ""the worlds top 2,500 scientists""."
,kenty,2009-04-11T16:58Z,Recommended reading as we are approaching the fiction irl.
,Diceman_,2009-04-12T11:23Z,"Don't forget about Down and Out in Paris and London:
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4596506

Despite reading Animal Farm in high school, these two audio books have basically introduced me to George Orwell, the world would be a poorer place if all the torrent sites were shut down. I bet copyright law in its current form will last as long as the Party."

,thamask21,2009-04-27T21:28Z,The audio book is amazing. The narration also great just pisses me off how we are letting this happen here now. Another e book worth checking out the grand chessboard by one of the puppetmasters himself zbignew brezinski
