Dracula leaves Transylvania in search of an amulet that controls the balance of good and evil, for his own purposes. He is helped in his search by the Wold Man, Frankenstein's Monster, The Mummy, and The Creature From The Black lagoon. The worlds only hope in stopping them is a group of kids in a club called THE MONSTER SQUAD!
