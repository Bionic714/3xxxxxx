Wallpaper Tray.

This program will manage your desktop wallpapers collection, and will give you a fresh new look for your desktop every time you look at it.

The program can manage and change your desktop wallpaper in two different ways:

1- At predetermined intervals: like every 5 minutes.
2- On windows startup.

You can add to your desktop a neat analogue clock and calendar, and you can assign hotkeys to perform some common functions of the program.


When starting with windows the program starts in the background placing an icon in the tray allowing you to access the options at anytime by double clicking the tray icon.

Right clicking the tray icon will give you more options including "Switch wallpaper now" which will force the program to switch the wallpaper to the next image in the list and an option to Exit the program.

The program's main window is very simple, it will give you access to all the available settings for the program and from it you can:

1- Manage the wallpapers list; Add files to the list either by dragging files from the windows explorer and dropping them in the list or by browsing for the pictures by clicking the plus "+" button.
2- Select how the program should manage your desktop wallpaper and how you would like your wallpaper to look like.
3- Adjust the desktop calendar and clock.
4- Assign hotkeys to access some common functions of the program.
