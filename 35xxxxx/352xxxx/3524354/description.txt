Santana's first album, back when he had a head full of acid and had just "arrived" - via Woodstock....   :-p

This is the original line-up, with Michael Shrieve on drums.
Some good stuff on it, though for me the nugget is Soul Sacrifice - one of three live Woodstock tracks included on this CD reissue as bonus tracks.
