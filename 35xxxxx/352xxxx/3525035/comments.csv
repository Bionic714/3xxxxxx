,jboo7,2007-04-25T17:01Z,"dont know about this 'snake and cat' scene....to activate sub file, as long as it has the same name as the video file and is in the same folder, it should automatically run itself, if you use winamp"

,drtdiggers,2008-04-27T15:05Z,"Some serious problems with this rip: someone had volume normalization on, so when the music gets loud, you can hear any of the voices and the volume is going wack the entire time.  The original Chinese is nice, but the english dub of this movie is so outrageous, its a shame we don't have the eng audio too :)  Will seed the eng dub soon..."
