thanks for uploading though, thats always a good thing."
,khonshu,2006-09-22T19:56Z,When I figure out how to that I will.

,Bamimi,2006-09-23T09:52Z,ya good point. that would be better. there ya have it khonshu.and of course seeding is a good idea also.
,khonshu,2006-09-23T14:35Z,OK I'll try and find some zip program.
