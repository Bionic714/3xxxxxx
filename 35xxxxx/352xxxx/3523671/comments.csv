[V],SCORPION2000,2006-09-13T22:17Z,Way in the hell are you upploading this old BETA cd? who the hell whant a BETA CD?
,qwikfox,2006-09-13T22:30Z,"Well, if you don't want it then just ignore it. It's really easy.

Some people might be interested in what the game was like during the beta phase, because there are quite a few differences compared to the final release."
,qwikfox,2006-09-14T01:25Z,"Ok, this was my first bittorrent release, and it looks like it worked nicely :)

Anyway, in case this link should ever stop working then here's an alternative ed2k-link for the same file: 
ed2k://|file|Starcraft%20Beta%20CD%20(PC).rar|217970442|421AC5CC4F1F8111F4C1F747568227D8|/"

,Koopberg,2007-06-15T05:25Z,"mine is at 61% and wont go on!!!
please seed!"
,pra,2007-07-01T01:30Z,"is this the battle.net beta?
if yes, there's nothing interesting about it. far more interesting would be an even earlier version, or the broodwar beta, which contain the old units graphics etc."
,pra,2007-07-01T01:34Z,"btw, if you follow the links of ohgodnotagain, you can find another source for downloading"
,ninjasource,2008-03-17T21:04Z,great upload :-) ...rare game stuff like this is always welcome
,JPeterson,2009-03-07T00:56Z,"I could not connect this game to my PvPGN server. I get these two messages at the end of the log

[error] handle_file_packet: [296] unknown file packet type 0x0000, len 41
[error] handle_file_packet: [308] unknown file packet type 0x0000, len 38

and the program just stands at ""Searching for the fastest Battle.net server..."" forever. I tried it with both the original Starcraft.exe and the modified one provided here http://avantageous.com/SCBeta.htm."
