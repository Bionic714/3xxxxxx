,zyzykwy,2011-11-13T00:39Z,someone shared an italian-english version of this movie that was exactly the same files and size but they stopped seeding with 5 people stuck at 98.7% finished.  VERY frustrating.  If anyone kknows who was seeding that one could they get them back online for a day so we can get the last 22 megs of the 7.7 gigs.  PLEASE.
