,Krokodilliscious,2010-06-24T03:09Z,"Cool beans indeed :-) This torrent is B-E-A-utilzed!
I'm a hardcore KoRn-fan, but while KoRn changes style brutally through out their CD's, chamber seems to be much more consistent, and did I mention FuKcIng aWEsOme?
Believe it or not, this torrent is the first I hear of Coal Chamber - was surfing allmusic.com and found this band name under Alternative Metal... 
Thank The Galactic CPU Allmighty for torrents! 
Would never know about this amazing band without!"
