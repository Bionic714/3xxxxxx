,Kornelius,2006-09-19T18:00Z,does the polish patch make the cars shine more? xD
,madrapsody,2006-09-19T19:40Z,"I don't think u'll have time to see the car shinig... but the patch is for adding the polish language in the game.
It doesn't change the design."
,Dog909,2006-09-19T21:37Z,"Does this version actually fully work?
The last 2 versions of CM2005 I have tried
worked ok.... until you try to change car setup or enter the repair area - then they crashed.
:(
Is this iso any better? "

,droideka123,2007-01-08T16:46Z,"I take it from the begining how I did. First I extracted ul-cmr25.part01, then I mounted Colin McRae 2005 US PL FR DE IT SP - Ultima that I got from the extracting with daemon tools. When I mounted the file I begun to install the game and I installed Gamespy too. Then whan the install whas done I just opend the game with the Colin Mcrae Rally 2005 icon that was placed on desk under the installation. When I did that It checked the disk and when I whas about to start the game I window comes up and says:GraphicsSS_SetupRender Adapter has no Modes! 
Plz I don't know how to do I have trided to reinstall the game and it doesn't work enybody knows what to do. Sorry for my bad english by the way."

,Dutyidili,2007-06-22T21:03Z,Köszönöm!
,silviuf42,2007-07-28T23:22Z,"the best approach to play this game is by installing the patch 1.1 and then the crack from gamecopyworlds. aside from not having to insert any cd, I didn't have any error, and I frequently enter setup because sometimes it doesn't give me the best tires for that track. I hope it helps. cheers."
,silviuf42,2007-07-29T00:17Z,"thank you uploader, this is trully the best racing game ever created. and let's not forget the fellas from ULTIMA, who made this release available to us (it's not an easy job to crack the starforce shit). nice job, keep up with the good work. respect!"

,yapler,2008-11-11T12:53Z,"Just wanted to tell that this game is truly great, one of the best racing games I've encountered lately.

Too bad about the crashing when entering car setup though, I'm certain that changing the setup would have me win more easily ;-)

No possible solution on this problem??

Grtz and keep mounting warez!"
