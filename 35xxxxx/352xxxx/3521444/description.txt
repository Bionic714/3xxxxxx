
This my foistest torrent and I'm comin' out swingin' with:

The Best of Boxing Knockouts Compilation (WMV - 5.29mb)
----------------------------------------------------------------
3 minutes and 33 seconds of non-stop "freight train fist meets chin" action.
Relish the safety of your home, as you witness dozens upon dozens of examples
of that mysterious, spontaneous narcoleptic event known in the boxing world as
THE KNOCKOUT.

cool   : audio tracks, content, continuity, zero commentary, no lame intro/closing blurbs
sucks  : wmv codec, seems recompression-molested as well

I made this?    : no
Who?            : dunno, but maybe peeps @ www.kaktuz.com know (tag seen in video)
www.kaktuz.com? : only been there once, recently; I dl this elsewhere, about a year ago but forget where


Enjoy!
