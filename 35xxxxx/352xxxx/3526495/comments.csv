If you have problems with this rom try the option ""Enable patch Cartridge access"" in the convert-software..might work from what i've heard..

Or go buy a g6lite..  :P"

I use SClite and Superkey, and can confirm it works when you check the ""Enable patch Cartridge access"". 


Thanks alot BeastG!"
