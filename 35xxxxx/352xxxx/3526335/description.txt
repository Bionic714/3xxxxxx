IMPORTANT: this is a remake of the special collector's edition DVD. I added audio and subs in spanish (Spain) and remade the original menus with Adobe Premiere and DVDMaestro,so you can select the language menu in the beginning.
I added a little logo in the main menu, and there are only spanish subtitles in the Featurette - Rising Star.

I advertize it.

Enjoy!
