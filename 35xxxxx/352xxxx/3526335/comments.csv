,majtymicke,2006-09-19T14:46Z,Cool. A Hong Kong Legends release (HKL). Would download it but I already bought it a year ago =)
,mindset,2007-02-09T11:58Z,how about original 1.85:1 aspect ratio
,mindset,2007-02-13T16:27Z,"i've burnt it to dvd, and when i watch it on my dvd player the picture literally stretches out to letterbox format (4:3 ratio). i don't know what the deal with this feature is, but it sure is annoying as hell.
i've tried with three different players and the exact same thing happened when i tried watching the film on those players as well

do not download this one, especially if you intend to watch it on a widescreen television. it's a mess"
