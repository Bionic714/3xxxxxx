In case you you didn?t figure it out by reading the name of the album: This is the Defenders total output, including albums, singles, rarities and bonustracks. I translated a biography from http://tinpan.fortunecity.com/mccartney/95/ because I assume most of you don?t read Danish.

Defenders were a beatgroup forned in Østerbro in Copenhagen in 1961 with the following members: Flemming Knud Sørensen (Born  3. march 1945 in Holbæk) (lead-vo, g), Peder Jelsbak (lead-g), Jens Henrik Dahl (born 7. marts 1947 in Copenhagen) (rhythm-g), Hans Klitgaard Larsen (el-b), Ken Gudman (born 5. oktober 1947 in Copenhagen) (dm).

In 1962-63 they played locally, in places like Restaurant Cap Horn and Place Pigalle, inspired by Cliff Richards and The Shadows, and also 50`s rock, influenced by Flemming Sørensens love for Elvis Presley. Their first performance was in Restaurant Cap Horn where the the group got more work. In the summer of 1963 Defenders had a regular jog playing at Place Pigalle at Bakken. They were the house-orchestra in Kødbyen the season after The Clifters. Defenders reached 17th place in a national Danish competition at Saga Teater to find ?the Danish Cliff Richard?. In 1963 they demo-recorded the numbers Teenage Heaven and Kisses Of Fire for Sonet Records. The demos were transferred to an acetate and were kept a musical secret until it was ?re-released? in 1990 on lp, in a limited 100 copies.

Towards the end of 1963 H.K. Larsen was replaced by Rudolph Alexander Hanius Hansen (born 24 august 1945)(el-b), and the musical direction changed to the new merseybeat coming from Liverpool. In December 1963 Jelsbak and Gudman left the band and were replaced by Benny Qvotrup (dm) (ex-Hitmakers).

Jelsbak formed his own band, The Contenders. Gudman left for the Danish Sharks. Dahl switched to leadguitar and Sørensen to rhytmguitar and lead vocals. Shortly after Preben Devantier (dm) replaced Ovutrup, until Gudman returned permanently in the spring of 1964. It was with this line-up that the Defenders reached the status as Denmarks most popular band in the years 1964-65. Defenders played a combination of r & and softer beat presented in a good spirited way. They performed nurmerous times on Danish and Swedish television. They also performed as a backingband for Gunilla Thom. In the middle of 1966 they jumped the ?Danish wave? and did great on the charts. Their greatest hit was the groups own composition, a sort of rock-cavalcade with lovingly ironic parodies of Stones, Hitmakers, Elvis and Defenders.

In 1967 Gudman left the band and were replaced by Jørgen Stig (dm) until Niels Kjær (dm)(ex-Checkers) permanently replaced him. Defenders played a part in the 1967 movie ?Jeg er sgu min egen? by Erik Balling and Klaus Rifbjerg. They changed their style to more progressive rock inspired by Hendrix and Cream. In july Dahl left the band. R. Hansen changed to lead-guitar, and Per Oluf ?Flob? Michael Hansen (el.b) (ex- Les Rivals) stepped in.

Dahl and Gudman formed The Young Flowers. Daul also played in Aorta together with ?Flob?. Defenders made their debut with new psychedelic style in Falkoner Centret in September 1967. In October Sørensen left and formed his own band Page One. Lead vocals were now sung by R. Hansen. Defenders kept on as a trio, and added Indian instruments to their sound, which can be heard at their only release as a trio. In 1968 Jerns Bjørner (org) (ex The Clan) stepped in. Defenders were finished as a band none the less, and called it quits in april 1968. R- Hansen had simultaneously been working with Steppeulvenes ?Du skal ud hvor du ikke kan bunde? In june 1967. An attempt to bring the band back to life as Ken, Jess og Flob was made in 1970, but failed, the group still performed at the Nyborg Festival the same year. Rudolph Hansen made a solo album in 1976, produced by Peter Thorup and he has played with Savage Rose (Nada 1980), and Peter Thorups Den Benhårde Trio (1987). He was still musically active in The Clifters and a much used studio session player until he died in June 2006.

Defenders made a comeback in 1995 with Flemming Sørensen, Jens Dahl, Pete Dennis (el-b) and Jesper Thorup (dm). They performed at Tønder Festivalen and Kalung Festivalen the same year, but were not a huge success, mainly because they didn?t want to play their old Defenders hits. All hope that the group might carry on died in may 1995, when Flemming Sørensen died after having abused alcohol for a long time and Jens Dahl died in the spring of 1996. Niels Kjær passed away in 1975. http://tinpan.fortunecity.com/mccartney/95/
