RedScript was created due to my extreme frustration with overly-bloated scripts that included every known addon under the sun, in an attempt to be everything to everyone.  I decided to make a stream-lined compilation of what I consider to be truly useful addons and some custom coding done by myself.  The script theme is based upon Command & Conquer, with .WAVs that relate to certain IRC events. It doesn't rely on large graphics or fancy fading effects; just a straightforward efficient theme.  Although not inclusive at all, below is a list of some of the more notable and useful addons:

- XDCC Browser (by Yochai Timmer, this is the best addon ever!)
- XServ (by ZeeG)
- Blowfish encryption (by GR81, uses blowfish algorithm & user defined key)
- TinyMP3! MP3 player (by oS/2)
- Away System
- Auto Ident
- IRCop scanner (performed automatically when joining a channel)
- Log Viewer (by Voice_of_Power, uses color codes and extensive serach ability)
- Whois replacement
- Online dictionary (invoked using simple command-line interface)
- Online translator (uses Babelfish, invoked using simple command-line interface)
- Lag-o-meter
- Integration with Bash.org
- Computer stats reporter
