,Storkme,2009-01-25T18:58Z,"tried five serials generated by the program, all were said to be invalid.

:("
,Megazero,2010-04-10T21:59Z,"Ok numbnut's who think this is a virus, you obviously have never used a keygen/crack (or ever heard of a FALSE POSITIVE). ALL anti virus programs have a nasty habit of detecting those as virus/trojan. I downloaded left 4 dead 2 and it picked up the crack a trojan, ive had the game for 3 months so far and have had no ill effects on my computer...Jackass'..."

,morphirr,2010-09-16T19:34Z,"Mcafee deleted this had to disable realtime scanning to generate key but then keygen vansihed or closed, strange there are 3 keygen files in different folders within this rar file, bit supicious? But got a working key out of it"

,deathiii,2011-12-18T06:47Z,"Yes. This is a virus. (McAfee detected it as a trojan moments after I extracted it)
The comments above saying it isn't is a butthurt trying to distribute a trojan to people who are too smart for him."
