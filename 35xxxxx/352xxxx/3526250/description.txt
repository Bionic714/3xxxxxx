-WHAT IMDB SAYS-
	Unicom is a powerful organization overseeing most of the world after its economic collapse. They have banned computers and robots in an attempt to insure "life, liberty, and the pursuit of economic stability". When a Unicom Synth robot infiltrates a southwest TV station and kills the manager, a revolutionary against the gestapo-like corporation, a lowly Unicom delivery man must help the rest of the station survive through the incoming "thermal storm".

-WHAT REALLY HAPPENS-
	Shit goes down at remote TV station. People die, blood and boobs appear, a giant robot climaxes.

-Notes-
For some reason I've had this one for a long time and haven't posted it. That being said, its been a few months since I've seen it, but its quality, even just for Bill Moseley himself. All in all, actually not a terrible film it has its moments, but its plenty entertaining!
