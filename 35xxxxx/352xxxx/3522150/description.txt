Guilty Gear follows in the footsteps of Darkstalkers, Street Fighter Alpha, and Tekken as the latest fighting game series to successfully touch down on the PSP, in spite of the system's portable form factor. 

Confusingly, this package includes two different games, but shares its name with one of them in particular. The game titled Guilty Gear Judgment is a side-scrolling beat-'em-up inspired by classics like Final Fight and Golden Axe, and while it's repetitive and mostly mindless, it's pretty fun. 

But you also get Guilty Gear X2 #Reload, a pure one-on-one 2D fighting game. The latter is the more complex, more interesting game, but it's also missing some key features found in previous versions and is harder to play using the PSP's somewhat imprecise controls. 

Other than that, both games share the sharply drawn 2D artwork, rocking guitar riffs, and wild character designs that the Guilty Gear series is known for, and both support local two-player action over a Wi-Fi connection. It's a solid package for fans of the series or of fighting games in general.
