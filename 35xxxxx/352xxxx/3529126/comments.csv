,wolfie22,2008-03-10T23:35Z,"DON""T BOTHER DOWNLOADING!! These are extremely low res, poor quality .avi's.  I can't see how any of you like these downloads."

,zappo23,2008-10-10T00:51Z,"wolfie, i dont get you.  why do you expect perfection with these downloads?  For one thing, they're probably pulled from VHS, which doesn't have a very good lifespan to begin with.  And then you have the whole ""been watched a million times before converting"" deal, AND the lack of technology available to amateur video converters to ""digitally remaster"" every little video."
,zappo23,2008-10-10T00:52Z," If you have such a problem with finding crappy videos, then stop looking.  You don't have to like it.  But that doesn't mean no one else should.  You're an idiot.  Nobody who loves feeling nostalgic about their childhood values your opinion.  You should just stop commenting if all you have to say is ""this is crap.  dont download it.""  I liked iv81's Season 1, and there's no reason why Season 2 would be any worse."

,Damascus25,2010-01-03T22:29Z,"Thanks for the UL, but all should know that some of the titles are in the wrong order.  I recommend checking the series Episode list on IMDB for the correct order.  Also, episode #49 Storybook Rangers Part 2 is missing completely.  Just a word of warning so you don't watch it out of order.  If anyone can find that episode and upload it for me, I'd be very appreciative."
,punisher13,2010-07-01T20:19Z,"I created an account for 3 reasons.

1. To support and interact with people such as zappo23 and iv81.

2. To support such childhood memories such as these.

3. To support my favorite torrent site."
