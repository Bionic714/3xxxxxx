And so capdown come into the bay......

The awesome debut from one of the best bands the UK has seen. This has it all - catchy brass, driving hardcore beatdowns, and punk-rock with a message. Includes the live favourites 'Ska Wars' and 'Cousin Cleatus'. Be embarrassed if you don't have this. (JT)
