,Preternatural,2006-09-14T07:10Z,"Doesn't work for me.  When I try to run the game the screen goes black, then returns to windows."
,pseudonymo,2006-09-16T12:27Z,"That sounds weird? I tested it, and it works fine for me. If you are running it under Windows, then try checking your graphics-setup. I hope it works out for you :0)"
,adamgillis,2006-09-17T17:49Z,"The only purpose of the desktop icon I can tell, is to boot from CD. try installing it to full and keep the ISO cd rom in your drive, that worked for me."
,Tuxis,2006-12-20T14:03Z,"Dosen't work for me either, I installed it to full and kept the iso in deamon tools. Any ideas on how to get it to work?"
,anemocipher,2006-12-30T18:14Z,"It works. You just have to run it in Windows 9X compatibility mode.

Right-click the desktop icon.
Go to Properties.
Click the Compatibility tab.
Make sure there's a check in the box beside ""Run this program in compatibility mode for.""
Choose either Windows 95 or 98/Me from the drop-down box."
,minor1,2007-02-02T10:50Z,"Every time i try to play, it loads fine but then i can only walk about 20 feet before it says, ""RealMyst has encountered a problem and needs to shut down"". what am i doing wrong???"
,guinia1,2007-04-09T16:53Z,"I downloaded it, burned it,and installed it. It all seems to work fine with only three exceptions, are these problems with the game or with my computer?
1. To much fog in the Mechanical age, I can't see
2. No fog in Selentic age, and there is no sky were the fog is meant to be
3. I can see the wire frames under the textures, exspecially when there is fog"
,Lektor7,2007-04-16T23:29Z,hello.nice torrent if it works.seed plz.thanks in advance
,Deesotilio,2007-07-15T18:07Z,"Actually, buying the damn thing gives the same problems on XP, and there's no easy way to fix it :P
The best thing to do is get Myst: Masterpiece edition (cheap at EB games, or download it here) and run that one... it's specially made to work on XP :P"
,Lord.Terminus,2008-03-06T14:45Z,"I just got this working, right about when I was going to give up hope.  It turned out that for me, Win95 and Win98/ME compatibility modes were useless, however, Windows 2000 compatibility mode worked perfectly, and I'm fairly sure it is even running at full resolution and bit depth.  So if you are having trouble getting this working, try all compatibility modes. @pseudonymo, I have been looking for this for a while, so Many Thanks!  "
,AzatiPrime,2008-03-24T07:35Z,"I'm getting the same problem as Preternatural.  The screen resizes, goes black, then returns to windows.  I've tried all the compatibility modes.  I tried installing the 1.1.1 patch and it couldn't find some file.  It's a shame.  I was looking forward to playing this."
,asphyx666,2008-04-14T17:10Z,"i have the same problem.when i run it the screen goes black and come back to desktop,but when i tried to run it from the iso autoplay in deamon tool i get something about the file extension has no association.whats up with that.if somebody knows please help"
,Transmission102,2008-07-15T12:13Z,is it for mac or for winblow$? why didn't you mention it in torrent description?
,fisk0,2008-07-24T01:15Z,"Transmission102: It is in the Games > PC category, I'd think that should make it obvious (though of course, if you want to be really picky about things, IBM PC, Macintosh, Amiga and the Commodore 64 were all Personal Computers), Mac games have their own category."
,fisk0,2008-07-24T01:19Z,"by the way - all of you who encountered problems in the game (I haven't tested it yet), do you use Nvidia chipset video cards or ATi (or anything else)?
I read on Mobygames that Real Myst is ""Optimized for Nvidia Graphic Cards"", whether that means it won't work at all on other chipsets isn't told, but if you don't use Nvidia cards and get those errors - that might be the reason. I have an Nvidia Geforce 6200, so it'll be interesting to see if I'll get it to work."
,Diceman_,2008-08-31T15:32Z,"I got RealMyst (pre-patched UK version) working with these settings:

-New Windows XP installation (slipstreamed SP3).
-Installed Omega drivers (I have a Radeon 9550).
-Installed indeoxp.exe (can't remember off-hand where I found it).
-Put autoplay and setup executables on realMyst CD in Windows 98/ME compatibility mode.
-Installed with recommended settings.
-Put Realmyst.exe and setup in Windows 98/ME compatibility mode."
,lost4815166,2008-10-03T21:05Z,Not working on vista...
,hakf,2008-11-30T01:10Z,About 20 hours downloading and then I've got a great game!!! Thanks :D
[T],Mincan,2008-12-03T18:41Z,Thank you. Wanted this a long time ago.
,MaxwellO,2009-03-31T15:48Z,"I've just downloaded the game, installed it and it works smoothly. I have windows XP and everything went just fine. Thansk for this great game."
,helloworldface,2009-06-07T17:31Z,"If you're having problems running in Vista/7/XP, have a look at http://s-o.homepage.t-online.de/realmystfix.html"
,Wanwo,2009-06-08T11:58Z,"Found an easier Vista solution. Go to http://m0005.gamecopyworld.com/games/pc_realmyst.shtml#realMYST Game Updates

and get the realMYST v1.1.1 [ENGLISH] No-CD/Vista Fixed EXE (662kb) and follow it's readme.

At first it ran a bit choppy in places but when I tried Windows 2000 compatibility it runs perfect."
,sevanov,2009-06-19T05:24Z,"I'm having the similar black-screen problem, even under compatibility... but when I try to download the gamecopyworld EXE it doesn't work. It starts the setup and then gives me this error message: ""Old file not found. However, a file of the same name was found. No updates done since file contents do not match."" 

I tried uninstalling and reinstalling the game several times... and the downloaded EXE does not come with any readme file for me.

Help?"
,roflwafl,2009-06-20T17:26Z,"@sevanov
The exe you're opening is the update patch.
Just get the file called realMYST v1.1.1 [ENGLISH] No-CD/Vista Fixed EXE and launch the game from that.

The game launches for me, but its too choppy to play it."
,sevanov,2009-06-22T03:06Z,"Ohh. I did not even see that download link. 
Thanks!

It was running really choppy until I put it into compatibility for 2000."
,clogmonkey,2009-08-02T00:37Z,"thanks for seeding guys, i remember this game from wayyy back :)"
,Anthony817,2009-08-11T23:15Z,"Hey kool thanks! I will try all the remedies on this page to make it work in vista. I was looking at ytube vids and was amazed that thi game was from 2000! I always loved Myst, but found the puzzles to hard on my Saturn, 3D0, ps1 ect, I had this on many platforms, but never had a PC back in the 90's to play it.

Anyway, My young teen mind couldnt figure the things out lol, I hope my skills are better now. ;)"
,Anthony817,2009-08-12T02:34Z,"Yep works on vista with that crack, don't bother trying to run the 1.1.1 patch, its already updated apperantly?

Any way to mess with the resolution to make it run in 1680x1050?"
,Anthony817,2009-08-12T03:13Z,"Yeah, you guys dont need that patch cause its patched already. I have vista ultimate 32, put it in compatability mode for windows 2000, applied the crack and voila, the game works perfect!

You can even run it in HD and apply AA to it! This game is great graphicaly!

I wonder, is it possible to play this on an original xbox running windows 2000? I am thinking of buying one and modding it so I can play older PC games on my TV."
,djcick,2009-09-13T01:21Z,"Great DL, being the only leecher, completed in about 15 minutes.

Hope to get playing :D"
,vinnylima,2009-09-29T20:58Z,working just fine for me. no need to use compatibility mode
,ekilore,2009-12-28T17:57Z,I have Windows Vista and it doesn't work. Tried changing the compatibilty in myst/properties/ and nothing... Any idea?
,Southlandz,2010-02-28T20:59Z,"I registred just to tell you about this thing that I found at the MYST community.

dodo says:
The fix is actually rather simple:

1. Open realMYSTSetup in realMyst's main folder.
2. Select a Direct3D ""3D Hardware"" that does not use T&L only ""[Direct3D HAL]"".
[3. You might have to install the Indeo Codec http://www.free-codecs.com/download/indeo_codec.htm.]


Good luck guys, it worked perfectly for me."
,Blackwisdom,2010-03-01T15:57Z,"I tried everything game starts up choose  a new game and i get a black screen.
I think my pc is to new for this game.
Thanks anyway for this torrent and the usefull comments here.Win7 x64."
,TimCereja,2010-03-08T22:56Z,"Same problem. I can install without a problem in Windows 7 x64, but it will not run. No such thing as a Win95 emulator?"
,Gamejunkiez,2010-08-23T17:06Z,"To make this work on Win7 x64 do as dodo says:
The fix is actually rather simple:

For some reason also my GPU was listed twice, I just took the first one.

Now set the compatibility of ""RealMYST.exe"" to Windows 95.

For some reason the game just will not start when using compatibility Win 2000 on my Win7 x64.

Also wanted to note I did not install any patches.
The game runs at full speed.

Hope this helps."
,ezrydn,2010-08-30T23:42Z,Anyone encountering any problems with XP Home?
,m0rb1d-eon1,2010-12-21T15:02Z,"The game didn`t start for me either(W7 32-bit). The only solution that worked for me:
1)Download the fixed exes from here: http://www.jaylittle.com/jaylittle/downloads/RealMystFixedEXEs.zip
2.) Replace RealMYST.exe with one of the fixed exes (I used the first).
