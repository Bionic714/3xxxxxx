Basically the encoding is really bad. It first of all would need to have been deinterlaced and IVTC'd (inverse telecined). Now it instead has interlacing errors (though the encoding makes it look more like ghosting), so that at times there are two frames visible at the same time. It also has lots and lots of very visible pixelation (the images looks sort of like a chessboard). The resolution, 720x544 is to big for the filesize.

All that said, while this version is better than none, it would really benefit from being better encoded."
