,StingDrift,2008-05-04T01:31Z,"It has little to do with seeding really.Some torrents work good even with just zero seeds.It has to do with the uploading.
When upload speed is faster than download speed,it works like a blocker,and slows the forward process way down.I have been downloading this movie for more than 3 days now,and the time elapsing goes up and down all the time.Is it still 2 hours remaining one minute,it can be 5 hours or more the next.Ridiculous.The torrent provider should upload this movie too.They often fail to do that.That is your real problem."
,StingDrift,2008-05-04T03:28Z,"And another thing.All those seperated files don't matter much.Even if you downloaded the whole movie,you still can't get the interactive menu on screen,to choose language and audio options.
So,you probably watch the movie parts with no subtitles,and even worse,no (proper) sound.Except when you play it on the VCL player,wich has an awful screen image.Too blurry.
Why,oh why,did the torrent provider put up the film this way,and not just as a whole movie in 1 file.A DVD rip off,to be exact.Was it that difficult,or do you like to see users struggle.
All those users,who want this movie,wasting their precious time on a ridiculous amount of 4.33 GB,days of work,and still get a departed movie like this.Next time,use your head instead of your dick."
,Xuxan_boy,2008-06-14T01:42Z,"Hi there. I've downloaded most of the movie and found the .vob files being good quality. Now I'm stuck at 94%. All but one of the seeders have disappeared. Is there any generous soul willing to seed, plz? This is a movie one shouldn't miss."
,Xuxan_boy,2008-06-14T08:48Z,"OK. Done downloading the movie. I just watched it and yes, the quality is good, and the movie is complete. Two audio streams (Englsh and Spanish), and 13 (yes, thirteen) subtitles: English, German, French, Spanish, Dutch, Swedish, Finnish, Norwegian, Danish, Portuguese, Greek, Hungarian and Czech. All working!
There are two glitches, tough: Two jumps in the movie, in 00:29 and at the end. The video is in there, however. You have to manually rewind the video. Well, this happenned when I played the film off my hard disk, with the bittorrent client uploading the files. I'm gonna burn a DVD and see what happens. If the glitches persist, I'll have to rip the DVD and rebuild it. Too much good a movie to loose it. Hope you all have better luck."
,Holly235,2008-08-10T00:12Z,Could somebody plz seed this movie. It's a great one. Thanx
