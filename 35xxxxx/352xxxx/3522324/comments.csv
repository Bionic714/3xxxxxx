Some seeds are slower than others, and not everyone dedicates their connection 24/7 to you. Where is your patience and why do you whine?"
,Norrland,2007-01-11T02:48Z,"Better late than never ehhh;) I didnt whine, and so didnt the other guys either. We mearly asked for more seeding, as the torrent was stuck for quite some time, so where is YOUR patience and why do YOU whine?"
,Mekashef,2008-05-07T16:27Z,This fantastic release could certainly use more seeds.
