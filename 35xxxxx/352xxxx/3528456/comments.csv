I'm new to downloading torrent, could someone please tell me how it works. I know a bit of the background, but how do I do this fare, so that I'm sharring my files.  What are seeds ? I love air combat games, and I've been looking for something like this for so long, please help me get this game. Thanks"

,Coke_zero,2008-07-26T12:04Z,I dont get the Install notes ? Burn the .bin   and .cue in nero ?   Can someone please explane to me ? :) 
,morty_1,2009-01-04T15:19Z,"Well, I am gonna explain several things guys

first Coke_zero:

It's quite easy, first you go to google and type in ""magic disc"" and choose one of the blue sentences which begin with the word download (choose the one which has your system name in it). Instal magic disc, after the installation you will see at the right bottom of your computer screen an icon with a hand and a CD. Right click that one and choose ""Set number of Drives"", choose one (you can also choose 2 or 3 or 4, but for now it's okay). Now your system will say that he has found another drive (if not, never mind and go on). Now again right click the icon and coose ""Virtual CD/DVD-ROM"", select your new driver (it has a letter in front of it), click ""mount"" and it will start a browser. Go to your folder where your .bin or .cue is and select the .bin. If you have done that, your computer will say ""Hey mate, I have found a drive, should I just open the map or start the setup.exe?"" You say ""start the setup.exe"" and there you go. Maybe you already noticed, but the .cue is much smaller qua kb's than the .bin. I dont know for sure why but if you also mount the .cue it'll do exactly the same as the .bin. Most of the time the .bin is bigger and has every file in it, so just mount the .bin. (I havn't downloaded this torrent, so maybe I was wrong about the .cue, so mount the .cue too and see what is in it, right click on the drive when you go to my computer and click explore. If it's the same, just go on but if there are different files in it than the .bin just say and I will comment)
Hope it wasn't too confusing, just ask if you dont understand something."
,morty_1,2009-01-04T15:26Z,"Now, nitharshansegaram:

actually it's also quite easy. If you wanna download this, and many other files, just download bitcomet at: http://www.bitcomet.com/
You can also download many other torrent downloaders but this one I recommend.

Downloading by torrents is pretty easy to explain, people all over the world have files on their computer. Some wanna share it and put those on websites, like the piratebay. We can download them but if the SEEDERS (that are the people who let you download from their computers) are offline you can't download because there is no computer to get the files from. Leechers are the people who want to download and are getting the files from the seeders' computers.

I hope you now understand it."
,morty_1,2009-01-04T15:34Z,"nitharshansegaram

 I am gonna explain your questions (I may go a bit fast, that's because I just wrote it and after a few minutes it was gone again so I had to rewrite it all over)

Torrents are put on sites like thepiratebay so people can download them. But if the SEEDERS (the people who share the files from the downloads, so also the uploader) are offline computers can't get the files from any other computer because they arent online. The people who are trying to get the files are called Leechers.

If you want to get downloads just go www.bitcomet.com and download it. Then click ""download this torrent"" on this page. And you will download this torrent, but if I take a look at how many seeders there are, it says 0. So a chance of getting this torrent fast is very low.

I hope I helped you a bit, if you have any questions just ask."
,morty_1,2009-01-04T15:35Z,"Sorry for the same two comments after each other, there was a misunderstanding going on so never mind."
,toblakai,2009-01-04T18:18Z,"How very nice of you Morty_1 :)

more info for starters can also be found at http://suprbay.org ... so if you are unsure about torrents etc :) go there and read up in the help section.

best wishes
tob."
,morty_1,2009-01-05T18:04Z,"by the way try this one, I have it too. It has 32 seeders most of the time 130 kbps. http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3267573/Lock_On___Modern_Air_Combat"
