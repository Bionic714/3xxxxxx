,TacoBurrito,2006-10-24T13:34Z,hmm... this many songs on only 156.32 KiB??!! this must be a very sick joke or a very big spyware!
,sindexxx,2006-11-14T17:12Z,This is just the .torrent to the actually albums. So you download a torrent in a torrent =P stupid if u ask me

You need an extra 4G at the time you're about to extract it - it also is time consuming and disk intensive. 'yuk
Use MD5SUM (good, fast, free) or some such instead."
