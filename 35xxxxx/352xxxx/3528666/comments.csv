,darkvineyard,2007-11-15T23:01Z,"This is awesome! Now I just need to find Season 1 and Seasons 3 through 5.

I'm very new at this whole thing, and I had to search to find out what Seeders and Leechers meant. How do I share this file? I don't want to leech it, or whatever."

,darkvineyard,2007-12-27T22:39Z,"omg thank you!
for some reason, when i click download -- and this is for all downloads -- it says something about 503 service unavailable -- is that temporary? because i want to get this, and when i do get this, i swear, if i actually get this, i'll seed for a week!! lol
