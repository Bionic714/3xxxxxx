Exactly, Rocknonstop, if ya had no comments, it mostly means that peeps are happy with quality & all, cos when u get comments, they usually are from whiners who complain about quality & everything else! So u could be grateful for not getting those whiners comments here :)

,mariusblast,2008-06-08T21:28Z,thanks dude
,stranjblack,2009-01-11T05:08Z,i dont know about you all but i think the best video player that happens to be freeware is the vlc player it can play absolutely anything accept drm protected files you can find it @ www.videolan.com or if you dont trust me google vlc player im telling you it rocks it will even play mkv files but if your computer doesnt have the speed for it you will have a few problems watching movies i know coz i gotta turtle here so my mkv's are a little stuttered while tha audio comes thru perfectly
