From producer Jerry Bruckheimer (Pearl Harbor)comes "Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of The Black Pearl", the thrilling, high-seas adventure with a mysterious twist. The roguish yet charming Captain Jack Sparrow's (Johnny Depp) idyllic pirate life capsizes after his nemesis, the wily Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), steals his ship "The Black Pearl", and later attacks the town of Port Royal, kiddnapping the governor's beautifuldaughter Elizabeth (Keria Knightley). In a gallant attempt to rescue her and recapture "The Black Pearl", Elizabeth's childhood friend Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) joins forces with Jack. What Will doesn't know is that a cursed treasure has doomed Barboosa and his crew to live forever as the undead. Rich in suspence-filled adventure, sword-clashing action, mystery, humor, unforgettable characters and never-before seen special effects, Pirates is a must-have epic on the grandest scale ever.
