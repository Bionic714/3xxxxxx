iuVCR is a Windows 2000/XP intended universal video recording program. Have a TV tuner or a video capture card installed on your Windows 2000 or XP system? Now you can easily record your favorite TV programs and videos in *.AVI or *.WMV format. iuVCR has got a simple and plain interface, allows to capture video of any format, resolution and duration, can automatically start when scheduled and has a number of other useful features.

There is a number of video capture programs in the world but the most of them work quite poorly in Windows 2000/XP, as a brand new multimedia technology called DirectShow is used there. The programs not using DirectShow give a rather middling result. iuVCR is a video recording DirectShow-based application. It uses the newest multimedia technologies developed by Microsoft corporation and ensures that you are getting the most from your video capture card.

As any DirectShow application, iuVCR allows to record *.AVI files of any size, overriding a file size limitation of 2GB inherent to old video capture programs. Using Windows 2000/XP and NTFS file system, you can record *.AVI files of size, limited only by your harddisk capacity. So, using iuVCR in conjunction with recommended hardware, you will be able to record with no frame loss long-lasting videos in any resolution with ease.
