Is this the Real thing?
I found the same torrent on BiT-HDTV but its 18.9 GB and in info it says:

""- 85% video is sourced from the exceptional 23GB 1080i .ts file capped by ABSiNTH and previously posted to 
this group several times 
- 15% video is upconverted from PAL format (576p) DVD 
- audio is from the R1 Extended Edition DVD""

And tnx for sharing, finaly something real HDTV to watch on my plasma!"
[T],HDTV CHINA,2006-09-10T23:10Z,"it is reencoded from 1080i to 1080p CRB 17Mkbps 20GB and plus Extended 30mins from DVD up to 1080p,totaly video is 25GB. Sound about 1.8GB."
,mofolino,2006-09-11T18:35Z,"I am downloading this at 170 kB/s, too slow for this large file :) 
c'mon guys I don't belive that you are on old 56 modems, seed and I'll seed with 5 MB/s. Tnx!"
,mofolino,2006-09-13T15:54Z,I meant 50 Mbit/s
,axehandle14,2006-11-03T00:45Z,"I can't get this to run, which is a bit frustrating considering it's size. It crashes every media player I use.

Any tips?"
