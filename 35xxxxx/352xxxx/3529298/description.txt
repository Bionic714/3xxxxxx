CANON DIGITAL CAMERA SOLUTIONS DISK V26.0

Since Canon only let you download incremental updates to their software from their site, you need to already have the software installed from the original disk. It's easy to lose or damage your disk, and if you for example bought your camera second hand you might not even ever have had one. If you own a Canon camera, then you are entitled to use this software no matter if you have the original disk or not.
So, I hope this will come in handy. Enjoy your camera!
