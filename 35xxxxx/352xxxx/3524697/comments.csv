,Waldobaby,2006-09-15T23:17Z,"Mrtjomme: More Info Please. Year , Actors, You Know=)
Well, besides the IMDB link above, the movie has rae Dawn Chong (Tommy Chong's wonderful wonderful daughter) naked. A lot.
Any other questions?"
,Waldobaby,2006-09-15T23:20Z,"However, some simple stuff like NTSC or PAL, name of dialogue coach, and so on would be nice..."
,majtymicke,2006-09-16T01:41Z,Audio would be nice to know also..... 2.0? 5.1? Mono?
,ursule,2006-09-16T09:20Z,"Thanks, there is another torrent from two months ago (more or less) but it deons't have seeders"
,Wetbones,2006-09-16T13:04Z,Does this include the audio commentary by the director??
,daqck,2006-09-16T13:44Z,"80,000 year ago a primitive tribe desperately guards its most valued possession, fire. They know how to tend it, how to use it, but its creation remains a mystery. During an attack by a neighbouring tribe their flame is lost and so begins an epic, obstacle-filled quest to find another source of the element so precious in their struggle for survival....

Jean-Jacques Annaud's multi-award winning film is an extraordinary view of the dawn of man and a true original. Winner of an Oscar and BAFTA for Best Make-Up Effects."
,Sicrea,2006-09-24T23:54Z,"Subtitles ?

Hugg. nugg; Yhappp

That  will cover most of languages if you have  two neurons working.

 As for 5.1; no way.

That shurely will trash the movie idea.Is about the life basics not the effects. The mammoths sucks and the sex scenes are far away form porn. Still this movie make you feel...well... as human. The saber-tooth tiger will get you and  start eating your flesh long before you die.

Give your brain some workout; get this great movie ASAP."
,Sicrea,2006-10-01T21:59Z,"BTW. Because the way it was remastered is necesary to make the 2 standar DVD directories:
AUDIO_TS AND VIDEO_TS.

Then move the files into VIDEO_TS before burning else Ur DVD-Player may refuse it.

PS:

It does have 2 audio commentaries form 3 actors and from the director, a whole set of galleries commented. Including Burgess dictionary of the language speaked in the movie. and yes there is DD audio but do not expect too much. The grunting sound exactly equal in bitstream or in PCM."
,oshling,2012-09-04T20:33Z,This DOES NOT have any audio commentaries or any of the stuff Sicrea said it has- I just downloaded it. Thank you though mimrik for this wonderful share! Excellent movie!
,oshling,2012-09-04T20:40Z,"Pardon me, Im an idiot....I downloaded a totally different torrent for this movie so ignore what I just wrote in above comment. (I wish there were a seeder for THIS torrent though so the audio commentaries were available). Sorry bout that mimrik, and Sicrea. "
