Above and Beyond - The UPA Club Championship 1999

Every year in late October, the best Ultimate teams from across North America compete in the 
Ultimate Players Association Club Championships.   
Having qualified in a  series of sectional and regional tournaments, the winner of nationals
is generally considered to be the best team in North America, and often, the world.

In 1999 and Mike Bell, Lance Larson, and Brad Holmes travelled to nationals to document 
the drama and excitement of  Ultimate at the highest level.  
The resulting three Above and Beyond programs ('99 Open, 2000 Open, 2000 Womens) have become 
the best selling Ultimate videos produced, and are watched by players and non-players around the world.
