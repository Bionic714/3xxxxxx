Welcome to ApexDC.net, the home of a new Direct Connect client based on the StrongDC++ modification. ApexDC++ is actively being developed - users can now try out the public previews of our milestone 1.0.0 release.

ApexDC++ is, and always will be, free from all forms of malware. The project is managed and developed by veterans of the P2P scene and as such we feel we are in touch with the opinions, wishes and requirements of our users.

ApexDC++ is a full featured DC++ modification.  It includes Tiger Treet Hashing, intelligent file uploading (similar to BitTorrent's), partial file sharing, and much more.  ApexDC++ is based on the newest StrongDC++ builds.
