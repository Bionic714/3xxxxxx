,psylynx,2006-09-27T22:32Z,"I do agree that utorrent is great, but azureus is pretty damn good also"
,videsparv,2006-10-01T15:01Z,I pasted the cracks into the MagicIso folder and replaced the previous files. But it still says its a trial version. What did I do wrong?
,videsparv,2006-10-02T18:18Z,"Ok, I figured it out by myself. For other dummies:
1. Execute the setup file.
2. Copy all tree files from the crack folder to the new MagicIso folder and replace the two with the similar names.
3. Double click the CRD-reg file.

Thats all!"
