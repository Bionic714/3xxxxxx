I'll be happy if I can help those who has any problem with watching these kid of Movies(file or Type). if you have any, just ask me.

--------------------------------------------------------
now. just foget that everything in PC world is Plug & Play. sometimes you've to install or set up something.

START.

1 - Just forget about your Windows Media Player. it's crap. I've tested almost all kind of media players. one of them is reaaly good. and that is VLC media Player. VLC media player is a highly portable multimedia player for various audio and video formats (MPEG-1, MPEG-2, MPEG-4, DivX, mp3, ogg, ...) as well as DVDs, VCDs, and various streaming protocols.
You can DL it from here : (for Windows ) http://www.videolan.org/vlc/download-windows.html 
for other OP systems , please check the home site : http://www.videolan.org/vlc/


2 - you need some filters or codecs. these work like translator for your PC, Which sysytem shold play how!?
one of these are AC3 filter. it enable your system to play Dolby and DTS sound system.

DL AC3 Filter from here , then install it : 
http://ac3filter.net/index.php?name=Sections&req=viewarticle&artid=5

3 - one of the video formats is Xvid. XviD is an MPEG-4 compatible codec, which produces very good video quality -- something that really competes with DivX. 
DL from here, then install it : http://www.afterdawn.com/software/video_software/codecs_and_filters/xvid.cfm

4 - the most usual, powerful and popular format is Divx.
DL and install it from here : http://www.divx.com/

*** When you have all these codecs and filters, then it doesn't matter which Media player you use. these codecs will be in you PC forever.

that's all for today. any question?

( I'll send this to all aXXo releases )"
,R3my,2006-10-08T14:50Z,"aXXo, we heart u."
,GewoonM,2006-10-18T10:25Z,"@ Cooldady at 2006-10-05 01:39 GMT:

You only need VLC, the codecs are needed if you want to see the movie in other mediaplayers

Oh and boys and girls: always remember to put audio to ""2-speaker""-mode if you haven't got one of those fancy 5.1-sets, or your audio will sound like shit! :)"
,seppuku22,2006-10-19T00:50Z,"As for this being a Madagascar Rip-Off, well, sorta.  The Wild actually went into production before Madagascar, but came out after.  The quality of the visuals in The Wild are far superior, which may be why it took so much longer for it to come out.  (Though, in my opinion, both movies aren't very good...).  This isn't exactly the first time Disney has had a movie idea taken and released first by competition, ala Antz and A Bug's Life."
,martysgyro,2006-11-09T23:46Z,"CoolDady. You do not need a VLC player to use any of ""AXXO"". VLC helps you in many ways, but with ""AXXO"" downloads, is always top quality, and the media player works just fine. To everyone:read what CoolDady wrote, because you do need this player in certain cases. Caribbean greetings"
,atarilover,2006-11-19T20:29Z,"windows media player is quality, never had a problem with it, plays all files!

,jasems,2007-01-24T04:14Z,"Has anyone tried converting this to work on a PS3? I have done tons of them, but this one and another axxo release it makes the audio go un-sync after the convert.  

It worked with all the others, just not this one and another one (can't remember off hand, I ended just getting a different version).


I have about 35 working ones already on there with no audio sync problems, so it's definately something pre-convert causing this problem, but have no clue what it could be."
