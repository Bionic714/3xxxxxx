ok first upload , hopefully its gonna sail! this is dodosim\'s real start for you rotor heads out there . Unrar the file in a temp dir. and then install it in your flightsim 2004 folder . Its a little long winded to install everything at first but the result is oh so sweet!!!a motorcyle kickng over would be far better sound than the default chopper starts eh? lol
