[T],Knaster,2006-09-16T22:47Z,Is this better than the gold release i havent been on their forum for a while so i dont know! I appreciate the upload nevbertheless but please answer!
,belson,2006-09-17T00:48Z,"Yeah, it is.  The gold was based off the 1.2 patch realeased for RTW.  Since this was converted to work with the AI of patch 1.5, it stands to reason that it will be a better challenge.  

Actually, this also works off of the BI expansion pack with patch 1.6 installed.  The link provided has much more detailed installation instrcutions.  

PS. Theyre working on a new release of 7.0 gold and 1.7 platinum.  There is a beta out."
,Senso,2006-09-18T18:31Z,Does this add-on (and the 1.3 and 1.5 patches) work with a cracked .EXE?
[T],Knaster,2006-09-18T22:07Z,Senso read the applied text file it is a quite good help if you're not sure how to install.

,Roland19303,2008-05-13T08:39Z,Yes it works with a cracked exe. The official forums haven't been around for ages. A shame too... the twc sucks (so does the org for that matter... meaning no decent total war sites).
