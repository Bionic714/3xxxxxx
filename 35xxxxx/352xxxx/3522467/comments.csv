This thing srewed my Slackware box up.
I installed the cedega engine from http://thepiratebay.org/details.php?id=3457206 then I installed this local update.
(maybe the real virus was the engine itself, I don't know exactly but I have to warn you anyway)
After installing the cedega engine and this upgrade, I tried to install a game,it took some 15 hours to complete the install, and it didn't work anyway, then, after the first reboot, I got such a long line of errors that I couldn't do anything but reinstall the OS from scrach.
No biggie, I always have my OS's on relattively small dedicated partitions, so my data storage is still there, but it was kind of annoying anyway."

Of course there are viruses for linux. http://www.viruslibrary.com/virusinfo/Linux.htm
And besides that, it's insanely easy to make a trojan that'll destroy a linux computer. Know what you're talking about before you mouth off."
