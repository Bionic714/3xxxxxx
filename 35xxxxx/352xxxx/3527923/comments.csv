,delimare,2006-09-23T12:20Z,Hot tits baby!  Thanks!
,Easyjeppan,2006-09-23T12:26Z,"I am new at this, what does seculoader means?"
,nocturna99,2006-09-23T16:47Z,0 seeds?
,ollsen_913,2006-09-23T17:09Z,Come on !! Seed !! I really want this GAME! Ill seed after !! PROMIS You
,delimare,2006-09-23T17:18Z,"Hey Easyjeppan,

I'm going to assume that the tools.rar within this torrent contains the securloader you're curious about.  If you're stumped on how to use it and directions are not supplied within this torrent then use google, you'll find a whole barrel of info on how to use it.  Good luck."
,Easyjeppan,2006-09-23T18:50Z,Thanks Delimare
,Easyjeppan,2006-09-23T20:08Z,"Im at 91,3% if i can make it to 100 i will seed and i hope there are more people that will do the same"
,Lewrid,2006-09-23T20:17Z,"...I'm stuck at 91.3% aswell

I take that as a bad sign..."
,slindfors3,2006-09-23T20:26Z,"Hmm, perhaps I should get this until the box drops through the mailbox :D It's not my fault that they delay the release... :/"
,slindfors3,2006-09-23T20:46Z,Excellent speed by the way! Top job!
,Easyjeppan,2006-09-23T20:53Z,How come some has good speed and others has 0 or just above?
,TPBChaser,2006-09-23T21:09Z,Wheres the fucking Seeder?  95% and no one above it...
,dutch_b,2006-09-23T21:49Z,"Dear users, please stop reporting, at how many % you are. It is 100% useless! I suppose that everyone knows, that It will take more time because there is just 'one' seeder at the moment. And about the game The Guild 2, it should be great. The gampelay, graphics. Just can't wait! Keep seeding mates..nobody likes leech-only-bitches in the world of torrents ;)"
,luceos,2006-09-23T21:52Z,"almost done, will be uploading for a few hours.. maybe tomorrow too, anyone knows if this is the english version; i consider buying the english one, but only if it's ok.."
,the_inquisition,2006-09-23T22:03Z,"Considering they have included (very poor) shots of an english box and DVD, I'd say it is the english version."
,slindfors3,2006-09-23T22:18Z,"the_inquisition: Yeah, but what do you expect from a cellphone camera? (Nokia E70 for those wondering) :)"
,the_inquisition,2006-09-23T22:19Z,"slindfors3:

I expect Nikon D70 quality, dammit! :D"
,Easyjeppan,2006-09-23T23:10Z,I cant get it to work that seculoader confuse me. Where can i find the seculoader? 
,skyhawk3k,2006-09-23T23:22Z,"Seems that some of you are a bit confused.

Unrar the files. A Image file and a Tool folder will be extracted. Load the image up in Daemon Tools. Install. After installing, enable all emulation in Daemon Tools. The trayicon will now turn green.

Then just load the Guild2 EXE file into the tool which are located in the ""Tools"" folder.
Then play and enjoy. Yes, the game is in English and working perfectly :-)"
,Easyjeppan,2006-09-24T00:38Z,"Thanks for this game, i missed the tools folder. So that explain my problem, but now it works fine. Thank you TerraKing for this upload!"
,godisdempaboy,2006-09-24T02:07Z,"xarn I got that too :(
I WANNA PLAY! please is it some one here some can make a good guide so I can install it right! ;D"
,godisdempaboy,2006-09-24T02:43Z,"yeah now it works but this game wasn't fun :S
I hope it that will be a great game but it was shit :("
,xNightWraithx,2006-09-24T06:01Z,"I've done everything mentioned, I unrar'd the iso file and updated my Daemon Tools to version 4, went through the steps mentioned on the error message when running the file with daemon tools after mounting them, used the included .exe and ran theguild2.exe through it. Then I get the game to boot, the intro opens for the developer and then it freezes. Any ideas how I can fix it?"
,xerodegree,2006-09-24T10:24Z,"I followed all the steps but when I use procyon.exe to load GuildII.exe, it always give me this error message...anyone can help me?
GuildII.exe has encountered a problem and needs to close.  We are sorry for the inconvenience."
,MarekKu,2006-09-24T13:28Z,"Dosent work with the tool same problem as Xarn mentioned...anyone with solution?Please...
godisdempaboy how did you make it work?"
,godisdempaboy,2006-09-24T15:17Z,"MarekKu
install the game with deamon tools 4, rightklick at deamon tools and klick at emulation > all options on so the deamon tools 4 its green.
and after that, procyon.exe dont unrar it it most be in the winrar. and dubble klick at that program and chose GuildII.exe and then the game start :D
but if that wont work try this."
,godisdempaboy,2006-09-24T15:18Z,EDIT: sry for my english :P

Any suggestions how to fix this?"
,HangLoose,2006-09-25T00:51Z,"Thanks. orkar inte översätta.
Någon som får igång spelet måste komma med. INGA problem. Dameon tools 4.03HE no emulations (röd). använder ""securom-loader v7"" (explorer.exe) från Titan Quest, som funkat på många spel."
,bluesme,2006-09-25T07:55Z,"Still got in-game problems.. after 1408 when got married game can't skip to 1412 (started new game 2 times and same happends).

Maybe I made sth wrong:
I've installed with Securom,RPMS on.
I've switched to all emu on and  used loader as mentioned.

In logfile.log I found this:
"".....\the guild 2\gui\styles\default\resizecontainer.gst"" that doesn´t exist!""

Any1 got this problem or know how to avoid it?"
,bluesme,2006-09-25T09:21Z,"^^ There is a Path 1.0 -> 1.1.

(path corrects many bugs making your game to crash so often)."
,HangLoose,2006-09-25T14:30Z,"Sorry boooring for me i'm a Obelivion-freak.
i don't like the tutorial (boooring)
But everything work's like the orginal game, i think !"
,HangLoose,2006-09-25T15:28Z,"May tell you. i got a troyan Nod32 deleted it , don't remember the name, but in a windows systemfile ??
Everything is OK now, Deleted the game and everything around it.
SCAN Now"
,HangLoose,2006-09-25T15:55Z,"i have to tell moore, this is one of the 2 games i installed last and the troyan i got, Nod32 detect it and delete it (no cuarantine) i restart and Nod 32 popup whith the troyan again (now i have the choise to delete it) after that and rerstart again no trouble at all.
Have to say i use Registry Mecanoic and TuneUp Utilities many times."
,Johnny Zero,2006-09-29T21:31Z,people are suggesting the english Reloaded release is 'broken' and this one is stable. i know you can change the eng version to german jsut by changing the toca.txt and config.ini. is the reverse true with this version?
,Sneltrekker,2006-09-30T13:08Z,"As far as I can see, this IS the English version. At least it completely works in English for me. ;)"
,Superpiccolo,2006-09-30T17:05Z,"Son of a whore! I can't get this prick to work properly. I mounted the mds. under DT 4.26, opened the EXE with PROC and it still gives the godam error message about ""Conflict with emulation"".

The most fucked thing is I got it working for a short time. I uninstalled CureRom and DT then reinstalled them them it worked (even though I didnt use CureRom with this game). Now it suddenly isnt working.

I tried reinstalling DT again but no luck. Shit a brick, anyone else had this prob?"
,Lolt,2006-09-30T20:32Z,"Xam, I had the exact same problem, starting it this way solved it for me:

1. Make sure you have The Guild 2 clonedvd version mounted and installed (realoaded doesn't work, and if you use the reloaded crack on a clonedvd installation it wont work either)
Also i have the german 1.5 patch and the 1.6 hotfix .exe, but maybe it works on a oure installation to, havent tried it yet.

2. download SR7.Stop 1.2 (just google it)

3. extract it on the desktop

4. start SR7.Stop 1.2, click hide, the close it

5. Start the game (enjoy)

This worked for me, tell me how it works for you. Good luck"
