,Fixxor,2006-10-01T01:20Z,wtf is the serial number?
,Fixxor,2006-10-01T01:22Z,anyone plz help?!
,Jorrell,2006-10-13T12:25Z,This seed has a keygen in the .rar file. Use this is other serial no's dont work!!
,aldoggy2001,2006-10-19T01:18Z,"after using this for a while it asks you to enter a activation code(not serial number)......Is it safe to login on to their system and get it?  If not, what is this activation code?"
,purewood,2006-11-02T08:24Z,There's no keygen in the .rar file - only a serial number in a text file.  I have the same problem after a week of it working well- it now requires activation when I try to use MyDVD...
,purewood,2006-11-04T21:19Z,"RE: activation- attempting to activate online doesn't work, but if you first disconnect from the internet it will give you an option to activate offline.  Use this option and it will give you an product key.  Reconnect to the internet and go to http://activation.roxio.com/activateme/ click on next and enter the product key... it then gives you an activation key. This worked for me (I used the S/N included in the torrent)"
,purewood,2006-11-04T21:21Z,"Here's the info I used- 
Serial Number: 61-UTR65-98K8L-95HU7
Product Key (from the software:) 40965-12644-43862-94504-24646
Activation Key (from the web site): 2C3CL-KWX2F-7Q0T6-T9FYS-D98XV

Let me know if this works for you!"
,HMC,2006-11-10T06:05Z,"So...do those work?

Also, this can convert AVI files to DVD, correct?"
,ferro8,2006-11-20T18:34Z,"Does anybody know how I can copy DVD-movies that are protected for copying? This programe doesn't aprove with that.
Thanx"
,BobSki-1957,2006-11-26T11:40Z,"Superb torrent, works flawlessly and the serial provided in the .rar files is just fine. Thanks Jorrell a job very nicely done indeed."
,solent01,2006-12-04T06:48Z,"Please Help, I'm getting know where fast trying to download Torrents, I'm using BitTorrent 5.0.2, XP home with SP2 and Norton 7, told Norton to allow through Firewall, and told BitTorrent and my Router to allow uPnP, but when I try to download most of the time I get nothing, and when it does start doing something its at 1 or 2 Kb/s up and down, one time it went to 25 down....... any advice please......
I have DSL 1Mb so speed should be good"
,srinivasg,2006-12-04T15:05Z,"hi, any one can guide me how to download."
,alxhome,2006-12-05T12:03Z,"look for http://thepiratebay.org/howdoidownload.php
and try.  "
,pcm2,2006-12-12T19:00Z,"I also got the system error during setup at mentioned in the first comment. Make sure that you create at System Restore point before you install. if the error occurs, just start the machine in safe mode and do a system restore! do not try to install again. if you got the system error i can recommend Nero. (It can probably be found on PirateBay)"
,morries_sa,2007-03-09T07:43Z,"Is it Vista Compatible? Does the Virtual Drive work in Vista, Nero's Image Drive doesn't work in Vista."
,celtic79,2007-03-13T10:57Z,Used this while i was on xp service pack2 and it ran great no problem.Converted pc to windows Vista and re installed roxio and now wont let me burn avi files.Anyone else had same problems?.
,TheOracle8191,2007-03-31T02:36Z,The S/N doesn't work. Tried messing with a few #'s and still doesn't work.  Tried 14 different #'s and none worked.  What now???
,darkone10,2007-04-09T20:37Z,"For ppl still having activation problem?? 
Uninstall and remove the Activation_103 file from the ISO or your installation folder and reinstall roxio. That will take care of your activation.  The method where you go to roxio and get the activation key also works. "
,sideris_s,2007-04-17T11:43Z,very good job man.tnx
,Ash_Katchem,2007-05-19T19:14Z,"Some parts of it work, but it freezes when I try to use Video Wave. "
,WIKEDTWZTDCLOWN,2007-05-26T23:41Z,THIS IS A VIRUS DO NOT DOWN LOAD !!!!!!!
,bojan86,2007-06-10T22:09Z,"Thank You Very Much!
Very nice torrent!

Big Hug from Bojan"
,cumintrip,2007-07-08T14:06Z,"I've gone down the route of removing the Activation_103 folder but now get the ""This is an invalid installation"" popup. When I do a complete install (ie with this folder included) and get the activation code via the Roxio site where do you enter it? I can't find anywhere to put it in!"
,pcm2,2007-07-27T20:43Z,"As I see on the comments, a lot of you downloading this has problems. I had to, and I have used both version 5 and 6 on WinXP SP2, with problems, especially with RW-Disc. So my solution is to use Nero 7 Premium Reloaded, which can be found here on PirateBay. It is Vista Ready and burns perfectly. It has all that Roxio have, and more."
,diamondsaloft,2007-08-06T06:05Z,could really use some info please im not sure what file to click on to install after i extracted the file please someone help a fellow pirate thanks
,Ryhelios,2007-08-17T01:37Z,"vey nice! sexay time!  hope this works! good lookin out jorrell, if it does!  if not, thanks anyway!"

,pfletch6,2007-12-15T01:43Z,"Where the heck is the serial number, you put S/N in the title so we should have it, where can we find it??"
,ScorpionPrince,2008-10-04T13:17Z,"http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4427752
New & Improved! Works I've tested!"
,brack75,2009-05-28T02:40Z,I think its so funny people cry Virus everytime there is a keygen installed do these fuckin idiots realize that Kegens are read as viruses by AVPS that are shit and give false positives
,92talontsi,2010-10-27T16:32Z,this does not work i copied it to a cd like everyone says and there is not a install exe file
