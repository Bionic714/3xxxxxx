,OljeOla,2006-10-09T23:12Z,"How do I use the Dos Box. Is there an otherway to do it? 

Bleed to seed"
,Spartamaran,2006-11-10T18:24Z,"How does one instal this game? Dosbox..?? Can't run setup.exe?? And in windows it doesn't work. Anybody??

OljeOla, how do you do?"
,OljeOla,2006-11-30T22:31Z,"Hi! I dont do at all. No matter what I do, it doesent work. Looks like conquest got me, for now. If theres some one whos managed to play it, or going through the same problems write a comment. Ill see if I can fix this once and for all:)"
,OljeOla,2006-12-01T02:05Z,"Blood, sweat, bent back and many hours later...
I have a playable C of the new world at my XP Computer. 

This is what you do:

Mount Conquest.iso with Deamon Tools
Install Game c:\games\conquest
Explore conquest.iso and copy all files to
c:\Conquest 



run dos box and type:

mount d c:\conquest -t cdrom

mount c c:\games\conquest

c:\

cnwmain.exe

If you want to change the speed or anything else, read the readme in the dos box folder

Ah, going to bed with a smile on my tired face

,sythem,2006-12-24T06:48Z,I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR THIS FOREVER! My dad's favorite game but his disk has a HUGE gash in the back of it and hasn't worked for years. I will seed forever! Thank you sooo much!
,joshbaz87,2007-01-26T01:22Z,"I really love this game!  I have downloaded this torrent, and followed both sets of directions in order to play, but nothing works.  I can get as far as the maiin menu, and setting up the games, but whenever I click 'Begin Game,' it starts to load, then flashes black, and returns to my desktop.  If anyone has a clue what's going on and/or how to fix the problem, it would be much appreciated."
,yap_alexander,2007-03-31T14:20Z,"Hi, can somebody please please reseed this game. I really want to play with it. Much appreciated :-)"

,jusjuan,2008-03-22T23:02Z,"Thanks for the upload! I used to LOVE this game, I've been looking for it for years.
OljeOla - I havnt used dosbox before. Followed you past the mounting part but you have lost me after this can someone please break the end part down for me. 
Once i have mounted the drives i cannot get the game to play

 Cheers"
,.: ToGGi :.,2008-05-03T11:53Z,omg. i only played the demo of this actually. this game fucking roxx  even if its old =) ill ceep seeding it for a good while=)
,s0merand0mdude,2008-07-12T23:41Z,"everybody who is having problems with the insert cd-rom error, even though it's a pain in the arse, mount up the .iso file before you play. it works."
,JupsiK,2008-08-17T08:46Z,"Hey, I tried to speed it it to 30 000 CPU cycles but it still seems a little bit slow, more than 30k and it crashes, what kind of settings have you been trying to get it work smoothly?"
,6R36,2008-10-18T05:30Z,"So I finally got the game working in the Dos Box, but no matter what I do it runs unbearably slow. I've tried everything from changing the cpu cycle to disabling the sound and setting the frameskip high.  Maybe it's just this piece of junk pc i'm running it on (Windows 98), but I don't think so because if I start the game using the MS-Dos Prompt (the way that doesn't allow for actual gameplay, just the main menu and combat scenarios) it runs perfectly fine. So basically what I'm asking is is there any other way to run this besides using Dos Box?"
,Enigma the downloader,2009-03-29T13:48Z,"I managed to follow the instructions oljeola presented

Now I have the same problem as joshbaz87; The game flashes back to windows when I am to start a game. Could anybody say what's wrong? how do you fix it? please

And thanks dayoung1 for uploading this great game."
,Braincandy,2009-12-02T02:54Z,"OljeOla - I have Daemon Tools and DosBox and have used them both before.  The only problem i have here is that i cannot find an iso file in the downloaded package.  Neither can Daemon Tools.  What am i missing?

Thanks in advance for your help!"
,JohnnyBlur,2010-07-20T05:07Z,Seed please! Downloading at 10kb :/
,XxmuffinxX,2010-11-23T02:48Z,"downloaded fast even with only 2 seeds.
