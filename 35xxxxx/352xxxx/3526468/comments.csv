,BennyPlumper,2006-11-13T07:46Z,"Indeed, the patch doesn't seem to work.. trying to install the game without it atm to see if it works without it."
,DeadlyAK,2006-11-13T22:17Z,"The game doesn't need any cracks. Version 1.68 doesn't need any CD's in CD-ROM.
The right install procedure is installing NwN 3 CDs, then NwN SoU, then NwN HotU, then the patch."
