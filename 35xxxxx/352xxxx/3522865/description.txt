Exactly what it says on the tin- a live reunion concert, recorded in Fredrikstad in 1980, from a much-loved Norwegian progressive/ heavy blues/prog band who originally disbanded in 1973. Here their sound is stripped down to bare bones as the nucleus of Bjorn Christiansen, Svein Gundersen and Ketil Stensvik give the material the full power-trio treatment without resorting to bad Cream imitations at any point (quite a feat). Features material from their 'Loaded' album among others. For fans of: Old Man And The Sea, Culpeper's Orchard etc. freakemporium.com

One of the early and by many considered to be one of Norways definitely best prog bands. Their music is a mix of heavy hard-rocking tunes, combined with clear influences from the symphonic genre. The more symphonic sound however didn't appeared until their third, and last studio album, "Janus". A great concept-album to start with. If you want the more thundering sounds coming from Aunt Mary, look for 1972s "Loaded". High-skilled musicians combined with good, creative melodies makes Aunt Mary an important Norwegian band to become acquainted with. ? progarchives.com
