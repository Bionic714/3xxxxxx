Reissue of 1976 killer heavy progressive rock album from Norway that was originally on Vertigo. Loaded with mellotrons and superb guitar work this release is similar in places to bands like Weed, Gracious and Czar, the overall effect being epic and heavy yet retaining a melodic edge. A great album. ? freakemporium.com

Flax - One  (Pan Records, NOR, 1976 / 1999)  Norwegian heavy progressive, a legendary album, English vocals and great guitar. And the clear the matter once and for all for all you collectors out there. The vinyl original on this was never originally issued on the Swirl label, those who sell that issue with a single sleeve, sells a illegal bootleg! The original hade the Roger Dean spaceship label and was in a foldout sleeve. This is 100% for sure, I was there at the time and is an expert on Norwegian 70?s, end of story!  Buy the way, save a hell of a lot of money and buy this CD issue of it. ? JÃ¸rn Andersen, Rock Garden
