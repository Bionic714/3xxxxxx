,Asgard-Neo,2006-09-10T18:00Z,How about some seeding on this?
,emo7777,2006-09-10T18:55Z,"Heh! probably everyone still doesnt have it 100%
Thers only me at the moment and I fear u should do with that :-)"
[T],maccis,2006-09-10T19:03Z,I will seed when I have 100%
[T],maccis,2006-09-10T20:35Z,And the activation code is?
,emo7777,2006-09-10T21:53Z,"For activating it u should:
1) use the cracked tomtom I have already upload
2) Keep the guam map that comes with it
3) Put whatever number u want for activating it
Cheers"
[T],maccis,2006-09-10T22:16Z,Thanx! I will try that!

,kvanum,2006-09-10T23:35Z,"What kind of gps are u using to the qtek 9100?
i tryed a emtac but tomtom didnt recognised it.
Dou you have to use tomtoms own?"
,TheChief,2006-09-11T10:07Z,"I use Solar GPS and Super Track 32sat both is working fine.
You should set our com to 7 in bluetooth connection in your phone.Take a soft restart.
Then use another bluetooth connection in TomTom configueration."

,hubbew,2006-09-12T17:59Z,I have the same problem...got the massage that I have to activate Scandinavia map..What to do?
,TheChief,2006-09-12T21:10Z,"Go to tomtom6 and read the instruction there.
I have made a more detailed ReadMe Guide there.
Remove everything and start again.
Read my Instructions."
,thejaller,2006-09-12T22:18Z,"I cant get the voices to work.
I have tryied some different locations but no voices....
Any suggestions ?"
,hubbew,2006-09-13T09:31Z,Have done as you wrote here but still the same problem...and I did not find any ReadMe guide in tomtom6...
,TheChief,2006-09-13T09:41Z,"Sorry ment TOMTOM 6.0 CRACKED.

But anyway here is it:

CAB files can only be installed from the phone,PDA,PPC.

So the instructions are :

copy the 2 folders with tt6today and ttn6ifalleni to your card.

Then use file explorer to find these CAB files and tap 2 times on each of them to install these files.

Take tt6today first.

So ttn6ifalleni second.

Take so all files in the last folder and copied these files to your card(Files inside the Folder)

So when you use file explore, you can see directly the files on your card.

Then copied the FolderMaps from you have downloaded to your card.

But see if there is a folder inside the folder.

It there is a folder called scandinavian, there can`t be a folder inside with the same name, there can only be one folder with the maps.

Folder --) all the files.

Not Folder --) and new folder--) and the files"

,luringen77,2006-09-13T20:42Z,"Hi there. I tried ti install this on my HP Ipaq 6915, and everything seems ok, but it cant find any gps module... On tomtom 5 it was possible to change how it should connect to gps, but under configuration in tomtom 6 I can only choos how to display longitude (h:m:s).
