,the_inquisition,2006-09-26T12:56Z,"The game comes with german and english on the same disc. You can install german patches if you just change a few parameters in the .ini files.

So far there hasn't been a patch for the utterly broken AI and the gigantic un-optimized engine, making it unplayable. :("
,Ykalon,2006-09-26T16:11Z,"Example of the broken AI. Computer can build and upgrade buildings so that you have to sell any buildings next to it since you can no longer enter it.
"
,Ykalon,2006-09-26T16:14Z,Could anyone scan the manual and upload it here? The tutorial just shows you the basic. I can't figure out how to get farms to work. Build all the fields but still can't harvest barley.
,TaintedMustard,2006-09-27T01:35Z,"You need to plant the crop first with a farmhand. Click on one (they should be waiting outside the farm) and you should see an icon that looks like a hand spreading seeds. I don't really feel like opening the game at the moment (it takes several minutes just to start up), but I think you move your cursor over that and then select the crop you want to plant from the menu above it. It's kind of lame that patrons can't do farmwork and scholars can't give sermons.

And inquisition: you're right about the engine. Too right. Around the 44th year (11th turn, I think) in my first game, the game started stuttering and pausing on any speed setting higher than ""slow"", even with all settings minimized. I've also run into a problem with a cart of mine (and about twenty other carts which were all there at the time) being unable to return from the marketplace, evidently because of a building upgrade. I've also had access to the inn near my house cut off because of an upgrade. Oy. This might be a buyable game for me if they could just fix those problems, but I can't imagine shelling out my money for this."
,maelvino,2006-09-27T15:55Z,"Seed please, I'm stuck."
,warbird2,2006-09-27T21:43Z,Stop whining please. And there are 25 seeds now

who knows how to fix it,thx in advance"
,Shadowvortekkx,2006-09-29T01:59Z,Does anyone know if there is a new crack out yet for the german 1.16 hotfix or any other way around it so I can try the new hotfix?
,Shadowvortekkx,2006-09-29T13:37Z,"I Figured it out. DONOT use this reloaded version. For some reason it always crashs to desktop and ASR and Procyon wont work if you are trying to use the 1.16 hotfix since there is no crack out yet for it. I Download the german version witch is the clonedvd, applyed the 1.16 hotfix and now use procyon to load the exe and it works great, no crashes anymore. Hope this helps."
,Johnny Zero,2006-09-29T21:07Z,"1.0 release of this is UNPLAYABLE.
there is a 1.1 german patch
1.1 unnoficial english patch
1.5 german patch
1.6 hotfix.
1.5 then hotfix seems to be the way to go. So you say that this release is defective and we should use the german CD? I havent re-downloaded the german version; is it possible to switch it to english (by editing the loca.txt and config.ini)?"
,Shadowvortekkx,2006-09-30T14:12Z,"well yeah you can apply the german patch  to the english version with just a few simple changes in the text of like 2 files. I am acually running the reloaded english version with the 1.5 german patch then 1.6 patch on it. BUT since there is no crack out for the 1.6 version and procyon and asr dont work for the reloaded version; I was able to just download the german cloneCD and load it with daemon and used procyon to start game. I think the reason the it doesn't work for the reloaded version is that the reloaded verion is in iso format, and the clonecd version is in bin/cue format. So the files on the reloaded version seem to be the same, its just the format doesnt work with procyon or asr to start it."

I think it means that the guild2 can't be updated because there aren't any updatable files in the map you indicated... have you specified the folder in which you installed the game? I could be wrong I suppose. I'm not german heh.

http://forum.jowood.de/showthread.php?t=143508

heres all the steps to prevent crashes!"
,MAup,2008-06-02T00:04Z,"rewrited the solution :)

Solution:

1. step: Disable the sound option ""5.1"" and select ""windows standard""

2. step: Switch the graphic to ""high"" or less (depends on the power of your system)

3. step: close the program and do the following:

a) Download the Explorer Suite from http://www.ntcore.com/exsuite.php

b) Extract the zipped package. For Vista 64Bit unzip the ""x64.zip"" and follow at point f)! For Vista 32Bit unzip ""x86.zip"" and follow steps c) to e).

c) Under Vista 32 click on Start -> All Programs -> Accessories; via right mouse click and ""Open as Administartor"" a command line.

d) Enter ""bcdedit /set IncreaseUserVA 3072"" without the """".

e) Restart Vista!

f) Start the Explorer Suite ""CFF Explorer.exe"" in the b) located directory with right click ""Start as Administrator"".

g) Open ""GuildII.exe"".

h) Look for NT Header/File Header on the left side and click on File Header. On the right side you should see a button called ""click here"". Press on it and make a check mark at ""App can handle > 2gb Adresses"" and save it.

i) Now your game should work!

best regards, MAup!"
