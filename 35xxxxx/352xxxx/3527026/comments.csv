,Karl Mundt,2006-09-21T19:45Z,Thank you very much for the upload. How do you burn it though? I've never downloaded a dvd that's bigger than 4.3 GB. 
,Nagoual,2006-09-21T22:13Z,You can use Dvd Decripter or Dvd 1 to make a dvd smaller
,rudolfo2,2006-09-21T22:58Z,"Karl Mundt:
Best way is to have PC hooked into LCD or Plasma TV ( many have this at home ),then use some tools like DVD2One or DVDXCopy to split the DVD in two,and burn them on Dual sided DVD if you have such burner or you burn on two DVDs as Part 1 and Part 2.Check the web for more info,best some DVD Forum."
