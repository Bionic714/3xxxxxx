The bin file is the image, the cue file is designed to tell the burning software how to burn the bin image file.

3)Install Settlers II.

4)Explore CD you burned and copy the two fles in there to the bin folder of your Settlers II install.

I also installed the Direct X from the support file. Can any1 Please Help me !!!
,Sheboink,2011-09-20T20:52Z,"@PinkPuke: I have the same problem as you, and I'm running XP on this particular computer.

Looking through the data directory it creates (My Documents\S2), there's a ""dumps"" directory, which contains log files of failed run attempts.

Mine says "".\Device\GraphicDevice.cpp 2778 : Invalid call"" - aside from the fact that they're idiots for using C++ (and leaving the symbols in the compiled code!), it appears to be pointing to a graphics card problem - driver issue perhaps?

I'll try it again tomorrow on a different computer... In the meantime, can you have a look in your ""dumps"" directory and post the error message(s) listed in there?"

Hi, it seems that some laptop users are experience
some problems playing settlers 2 10th anniversary.

1 - a small windows apears on the top left coner,
and the game wont start.

2 - the log file \S2\dumps\Logfile*** shows:

.\Device\GraphicDevice.cpp 2778 : Invalid call

I pass this error by running ""3D Analyse"".
1 - load the EXE file
2 - selected --- force SW TnL ----
3 - then press run.

The game should start ok.


here the link to 3D Analize
( i dont known, if i can place the link here.)
""""http://www.3dcenter.de/downloads/files/cb46p71/3d-analyze.zip""""

Inneed
Good Luck
