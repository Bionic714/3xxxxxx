The Settlers II will allow PC gamers to revisit the 1996 classic, enhancing
  the players' experience with 3D up-to-date graphics and new gameplay
  additions. An all-new game engine has also been developed exclusively by
  Ubisoft's Blue Byte Studio (Germany) in cooperation with Funatics.
  This engine will generate an interactive 3D environment and charming comic
  strip look including beautiful fauna and flora. Typical sound and music
  effects will underline the bustling atmosphere of the game.
