Richard Crenna was very famous from radio days on ""Our Miss Brooks"" and TV's ""The Real McCoys"" with Walter Brennan.

Richard Attenborough was very much a highly respected actor from Britain before ever making ""The Sand Pebbles"".  He had already made many films since 1942; including ""The Great Escape"" and ""The Flight of The Phoenix"".

Candice Bergen's second film role at age of 19.  She is the daughter of the famous Edgar Bergen, a ventriloquist of the 20's, 30's, and thru the 50's.  His characters were Charlie McCarthy, Mortimer Snerd and others."
