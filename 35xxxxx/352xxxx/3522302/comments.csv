,sultanselim,2006-09-18T21:27Z,In Europe 9 we use Date/Month/Year Not Month/Date/Year. Thus 9/11 is 9th november here:)

any help?"
,MisterShogun,2011-02-12T00:39Z,"@aduma1984 on every DVD folder, at the bottom, there should be a .rar file, that's where the .iso is located.

Glad to of found the full 202 mins rip of Redux, I'll seed for as long as I can."
,MisterShogun,2011-02-12T00:40Z,"Also just realised my mistake, use WinRar or WinAce to extract the .iso."
,MisterShogun,2011-02-12T00:42Z,"Just realised my mistake, use WinRar or WinAce to extract the .iso files, then use either Daemon Tools, Nero or Alcohol 120% to either burn the image onto a blank DVD, or mount onto a virtual drive."
