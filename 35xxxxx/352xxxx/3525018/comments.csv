Check out my latest torrent.. "
[T],BeastG,2006-09-19T21:12Z,"On your problem to get the game to work..there is a patch until the supercard team releases their latest convert software...

you should find it here..
http://l33t.spod.org/ratx/DS/SC/misc/lsw_sc.zip"
[T],BeastG,2006-09-19T21:13Z,"heres a guide to use the patch..:


Use the SC software to make the save file and the 0kb file on your SD card, delete the 0kb file 
Rename the save file to Lego Star Wars II.nds.sav 

Using the patch file, unzip contents to c:\ 
Unzip the .nds file from your Lego Star Wars II rom to c:\ and rename it to clean.nds 
Go to START>RUN and type cmd 

type in c:\bspatch.exe clean.nds ""Lego Star Wars II.nds.dsq"" lsw_scl.bdf 

Close the black window and navigate to c:\ 

Copy Lego Star Wars II.nds.dsq to where you put your .nds files on your SD card. 

If you've done this correctly, in your Nintendo DS Games folder, along with all your other games, you should have two called.... 

Lego Star Wars II.nds.dsq 
Lego Star Wars II.nds.sav 

Put the SC in your DS and run it like normal! "
,winzentween,2006-09-20T11:36Z,"hi not sure if it works yet but thanks for making the effor all the same, good to see you on the job, keep up good work"
,winzentween,2006-09-20T15:41Z,"hi i did the cmd and it says c:\bspatch oldfile newfile patch file  
then i look in c directory but alls the same no new lego starwars? just clean.nds

spiderman / megaman and lego star wars wont run on current conversion software so could you take a look at instructions again and see if theres a cmd typo of mistake?

regards to the beast"
