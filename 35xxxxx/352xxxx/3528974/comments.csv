,skyydragonn,2008-09-08T15:38Z,"for those that updated to ver 1.05 (or 1.5?) your going to have to UNINSTALL it and re-install it again. The patch detects the virtual drive (deamon tools) and wont allow the game to run.
 this time follow the directions provided by the torrent uploader and you wont have any problems :)"
