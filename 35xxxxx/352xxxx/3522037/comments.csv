No tiene las versiones en espa単ol."
,_DvD_,2008-11-13T17:56Z,"I only needed the first album, which is coded in 192 kbps. Turns out is wasnt coded that good, lots of cracks and hisses. Wouldn't recommend this if you like your music as pure as possible."
,italy7622,2009-03-09T13:16Z,Keep in mind Pausini is NOT Spanish she is Italian.  She does some songs in Spanish..but not all..she is after all ITALIAN.
,jbiaggi,2009-06-02T02:30Z,"To rectify what italy7622 said. Laura Pausini is Italian, yes, we all know that. Laura Pausini had recorded every single CD she had made in Italian in Spanish too. From her first CD in 1993 called Laura Pausini until the last one called Primavera Anticipada. I have the entire discography in both language, Italian and Spanish."
,jbiaggi,2009-06-02T02:33Z,It is sad that people from her own country does not know about her work. I have a website with 28 mixes I made myself of Laura's song. Downloads of this mixes are free. Feel free to visit: www.biaggi.us
,mjz013,2009-06-05T22:09Z,"We get it, she's italian. But, aren't the tracks that she's recorded in other languages, part of her discography, italy7622?"
,camicio,2009-12-18T11:56Z,"_DvD_  is right, only downloaded the first album and it's badly coded, lots of hissing."
