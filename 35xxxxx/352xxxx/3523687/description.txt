The  golden era of hockey videogames is back with NHL 07 brought to you by EA
 SPORTS  brand of the best-selling hockey videogame. Console hockey now rivals
 its  counterpart  on  the  ice  with  an unmatched level freedom and control.
              
 NHL  07  puts  you  in  total  command  with  a revolutionary new Skill Stick
 system.  Never  take  your  hands  off the analog sticks as you take complete
 control  of  all  skating  on  the left, and - for the first time in a hockey
 videogame  -  passing  will use an intuitive motion on the right analog stick
 to execute with precision.
              
 Feel  like  a  part  of the team with a level of passing fluidity that allows
 you  to  implement a realistic team strategy. Look to your teammates and know
 how  to best use their strengths with New Player-Specific Behaviors. Play the
 game  like  you  do on the ice: Be the Playmaker and find your Sniper open in
 the   slot,   or   let   your   Dangler  make  pylons  out  of  the  defense.
              
 Off  the  ice,  act  as  the  General Manager in an enhanced Dynasty Mode. Do
 whatever  it  takes  to  meet  an  owner's  expectations by properly managing
 rosters  and  using your creativity to fit player salaries under the new cap.
 Whether  you're  running  the  front office or dominating the rink, NHL 07 is
 the   most   intuitive   and   realistic   hockey  experience  ever  created.
