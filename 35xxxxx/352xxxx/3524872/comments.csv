,TokinDerrick,2006-09-16T10:21Z,"this is my first time uploading anytying so let me know if something is worng, it says no one is seeding but I am!

also, I tried putting this on demonoid, but it apparently got deleted, so maybe I did something worng.

someone clue me in?"
,m.mm,2006-09-16T10:40Z,"If this was your first uppload I hope it was two of a kind - your first and your last!!! Show some respect  man. These movies are the worse shit ever! I hope it's not your dad they 'r beating up!!My opp, Peace'n Love!!!! M/"
,crosone,2006-09-16T10:42Z,No shit - those entertained one bit by this crap are complete losers.  Sad.
,jerbe,2006-09-16T10:44Z,"TokinDerrek: A link to more information like this: http://www.rottenstore.com/bu4reofru.html
might be good to throw in.
Also, I find this type of material almost as repulsive and disgusting as child porn, but other than that (which is my personal view), your upload looks just fine."
,uberdogleg,2006-09-16T10:46Z,"yeah, this is sick. poor guys"
,parlyzone,2006-09-16T10:51Z,"LOL! You're first UPLOAD!?

Check the Files List! LOL! ""Torrent downloadet from Demonoid""!

You can't run from that! Pathetic...! Why would you even try to take credit for this? There are many experienced users here, so you would have been exposed sooner than later...!

Sure you didn't invent fire while you where at it?! Or electricity?! Or the wheel?! Or maybe you created Pirate Bay?! Or my computer!? ...Then again, I just think this is a result of severe lack of selfconfidence... Get a grip loser!

This torrent was donloadet from Demonoid, and NOT uploadet by TokinDerrick! "
,parlyzone,2006-09-16T11:35Z,"And a great upload it is... But still;

Quote: ""Just got it in the mail today.""

LOL! I just don't understand why?"
,jone1,2006-09-16T12:04Z,anyone have covers for this ?
,Flash99,2006-09-16T13:30Z,"Thx 4 upl!! TokinDerrick

Why can´t some poeple just be quiet? If they don´t like the movie - just don´t download it. No need to pick on the uploader. I don´t give a shit if he got in on the mail or downloded it somewhere else or if it is disquasting movie.
Fuck you all complainers!"
,TokinDerrick,2006-09-16T19:19Z,"this is my first upload a member to this site.

this is not my first upload, nor my first time even being on this site.

theres tons of other bumfights stuff on this site, probably stolen from other sites.  I actually bought and paid for this myself and ripped it myself and uploaded it to you for you ungrateful fucks that want to hate.

those that are saying thanks, no big deal, just keep seeding and were all good.

some people must like it if there are currently 54 seeders.  "
,Ghostis,2006-09-16T19:26Z,Nice stuff! Thanx man i will seed this a long time ahead when i get it. :)
,Turdkey,2006-09-16T21:04Z,"I think the point is, you didn't rip this yourself.  In fact, it's not being released until 10.17 for retail.  I'm sure you would have caught a lot less shit if you just uploaded it without a lie.  

Regardless, everything you DL is stolen anyways...just no need to take credit when it's not due."

,zaltan,2006-09-16T22:52Z,Anyone watching this kind of crap is a retarded little fuck. Get a life and grow up you fucking retards!
,TokinDerrick,2006-09-17T06:11Z,"you seriously don't think Ir ipped this myself?

dude, I fucking did, I received it the day I uploaded it, no joke.

I'm not lying, why would I need to.

I don't have a camera, but trust me, I really didn't rip this.

I even had it uploaded to demonoid on the same name for about an hour until it got taken off becuase they don't allow such conduct.

you're being an ass, I really did receive it, lemme get the address of the website for you where I bought it.

http://www.mixtapemurder.com/detail.php?item_id=3774

don't you dare fucking tell me I didn't rip this myself and call me a liar, I did, I'm so pissed off right now.  I paid for it with my own money and ripped it to be nice, and you're being a fuckhead telling me I didn't rip it and I""m lying.

you're probabyl downloading this from me too"
,TokinDerrick,2006-09-17T07:36Z,"also, I've got Bling-a-long in DVD (I can rip and upload of theres enough requests) and I've also got  Indecline Vol 1 on dvd which I can rip and upload if requested aswell.

I""ve also got the bling-a-long cd, which has the bonus footage on it, I'd upload it if someone could show me how using mac os programs.  (I think the videos on the cd that are bonus are in .swf form)"
,parlyzone,2006-09-17T11:49Z,"If you bought it online you can post a copy of the receipt, right?

E-mail me a copy, if you want me to believe your stupid lie!

Why is there a text file called ""Torrent downloadet from Demonoid"""
,TokinDerrick,2006-09-17T19:04Z,"for the same reason the torrent name has ""copy"" in it, I tried to upload it to demonoid, but they have a rule against bumfights (didn't know) and you have to include that file for their rules.  I tried to make another torrent ot the same source on my computer and it woudln't let me so I had to make another torrent file (hence, COPY).  here is the e-mail paypal receipt I got for them, if you guys don't believet this, then fuck off and I won't even bother uploading my other releases."

,TokinDerrick,2006-09-17T19:15Z,"theres my proof.

if nobody agrees with it, then download the file and see for yourself its real, and its authentic, to be honest, threres no bonuses so the xvid version is probably the same, but the dvd to me is always better.

again, I've also got bling-a-long and incecline vol 1 (and no, I can't prove I bought those because I got those ages ago)"
,parlyzone,2006-09-17T22:07Z,"You don't have to prove you bought anything else but this, as long as you don't take credit.. 

...By the way, Bling-A-Long and Indecline is already out.. We're not depending on you to upload anything, everything you have uploaded was already available (even Bumfights 4 was available on isoHunt in .img format!)

Love the receipt though... Didn't have the info i was looking for, but still.. Nice!"
,GothDude,2006-09-18T00:24Z,just a quick message to m.mm go n fuck yrself you retard! Bumfights is the greatest thing ever its funny as fuck and if you've got a problem with it go choke on a hobo's dick! Im dwnloading this for sure nice upload TokinDerrick keep em coming mate!!!
,GothDude,2006-09-18T00:29Z,All you whingey cunts that have nowt better to do than complain just fuck off and get a life this is quality entertainment and dude I'd just like to say you shouldnt have to worry about proving to these cunts that you bought a DVD etc fuck them all!!!!
,TokinDerrick,2006-09-18T06:33Z,"thanks to the last couple of guys.

what was the receipt missing that proved I didn't buy it?

this is an honest to god rip of mine, and I see no reason why I would need to say someone else's is mine.

anywayz, yeah, I know the others are already out there, but they're usually packaged with other crap, or they're lame xvid, this is for the hardcore dvd-r people, like mysel.
"
,TokinDerrick,2006-09-18T06:37Z,"oh, and parlyzone, I do (and am taking credit) want to take credit for this.

thisis my quality rip, and I don't want others plastering their name on it."
,Smack!,2006-09-18T09:12Z,"Hey TokinDerrick Cant you rip (Bling-a-long soundtrack) and Bfk soundtrack ?.. 

That would be sooo Cool mate :)"
,parlyzone,2006-09-18T10:15Z,"Did I seriously hurt your feelings? This isn't even the best copy on the net (why download the entire shit, when you can get it in .img or .avi without loss of quality or bonus videos!) And about the credit-taking, WHY? and for what? You bought this to put it up for stealing? Yeah, great job dude.. A true wiseman.. Do you NEED their thanks? Are you THAT low on selfesteem? I (and others) already told you that you did a great job! It's great quality and sound, and it's nice to have BF 4 ROR in real dvd format! Just don't flatter yourselfes with thinking that people give a shit about who's uploading, maybe some people without a social life has the time to thank every person uploading anything they downlaod, but I won't waste my life with that shit, BUT when i see somebody try to take credit for some others work, i get disgusted! I'm a serious uploader myself, check it! 

(And i made a joke about the info because you remembered to wipe your adress out, would've been fun otherwise.. Good advice: Don't post something like that again, there's info you don't want some people to see, i know i said ""post a copy"" and that was wrong, i meant E-mail me..)

Oh, and the next time you upload at demonoid, don't download the torrent from demonoid again , make a new torrent (with new infohash!) (never heard of your problem!) or else you'll be the laughing stock of the forums.."
,TokinDerrick,2006-09-18T10:35Z,"again, you just said that I didn't rip this myself, and that i redownloaded the torrent from demonoid (which I didn't, I erased that .torrent file, but used the same source file (video_TS) file, which I forgot to remove the demonoid file.

you apparently do have enough free time to thank people for their work if you've got itme to flame them and make up lies saying I""m taking credit for others' work.

oh, and .img format is probably more ofa  loss of format than the actual rip that your'e getting from me, this is straight from disc, no loss of quality at all, an .img file  is both of the video and audio filesinto one file (must be some kind of compressionk, not much to tell).  but again, you're making claims you don't know anything aobut because nobody has finished downloading it yet (dont' know how to super seed).

but by the end of the night a crapload of people should have it, and we'll see who here is glad they got the dvd copy and whatnot, again, you're probably one downloading it, and i you're not, stop reading this thread and move on to something you actually have interest in, assclown.


"
,parlyzone,2006-09-18T11:26Z,"I HAVE downloadet this shit, wanted it on DVD.. The counter at the top sometimes doesn't register after a while..

I HAVE also stated that i believe you bought it.. Just told you how not to make the same  mistake again, and tell you that there's no point in seeking respect in these circles, most people don't thank anybody for anything (I should know, check out my uploads!) 

And this is a great upload, told you that yesterday.. Anybody who wants this on DVD has the chance to do so without any burning issues!

What program are you using? Azureus is the best if you're seeding a lot... (if you want help with the super-seed)"
,TokinDerrick,2006-09-18T19:15Z,"so it burns problem free?

I ripped it using Mac The Ripper.

and yes, using azureus (wanna clue me in on super seeding, that way it gets out faster) (I'm on a mac too, if that matters)"
,parlyzone,2006-09-18T23:21Z,"I found this link:

http://azureus.sourceforge.net/howto_osx.php

I think you can use Azureus with mac os, but i'm not sure.. Check it out.."
,TokinDerrick,2006-09-18T23:53Z,"yewah, you can, thats what I'm using.  I just can't get it to super-seed."

[V],Skitcp,2006-09-20T13:37Z,"i hope the guys how made thees movied fucking DIE! from rectal cancer. and that befor the die every one that they loves gets fucing RAPED too death,
"
,TokinDerrick,2006-09-20T19:21Z,"get bent.

I don't understand why if you don't like the content, why you'd even click on it?

I see disney movies on here all the time, but I do go into them to comment about how they throw gay messages in there.

by the way, the same people that made the first two bumfights, are not the same people that made the last 2.  they're also not for humour (for the most part) its to show that what this world is coming to, what the youth are doing with their free time, what bums do if you give them money.  things of this nature.

if you were to download and view the movie, it has an explaination as to why this and others like it are out, and it says ""spread love, not hate"".

truth."
[V],Skitcp,2006-09-21T08:11Z,"u can say what ever u like about this movie being a message of love .it like i would rape children record it and claim "" HEY NOO im not a pedofile im just showing what the world is coming to!"" 
i still think downloading and spreding thing shit shuld be punishable by death .

ALL U LITTLE ASSHOLES THAT GETS A KICK OUT OF WHATCHING THIS I HOPE YOUR MOTHER DIES!
I PRAY THAT IN THE FUTURE ALL YOUR CHILDREN WILL BE STILLBORNE!

i hate you more then words can say."
,TokinDerrick,2006-09-21T11:57Z,"little too much e-testosterone.

dude, just stop checking this page and leave it be.  nothing you say is going to stop anyone from downloading and seeing it if they want to."
,Cannavarolt,2006-09-30T10:33Z,Can any1 tell me what kind of music style is played at the beggining of this movie?
,koleskabet,2006-11-07T15:41Z,"ey, yeayeah.. newbie question.. but how do i burn this, so my dvd player can read it ? (:"
,badtz,2007-01-10T15:39Z,"oww 3.2 GiB
please riped :)"
,TokinDerrick,2007-02-18T06:38Z,"wow, is this still really being seeded.  I uploaded this so long, I forgot I even owned this DVD.   I finally logged into my account for the first time in forever."
,obligon,2007-06-01T16:48Z,"hey tokin. is there anyway you could rip indecline dvd's? I would so appreciate that. 

thanks in advance =)"
,niggaricho,2007-06-18T21:55Z,fyfan indecline vill jag ha! om nån skulle kunna ladda upp den så avlider jag av glädje!

,mitk0o0o0,2010-09-12T16:46Z,"Thanks for uploading, any chance you can start seeding this again? Please, i'm dieing to have the full DVDs of all volumes. Please upload volume 3 if you can. I'll upload volume 1 full DVD tomorrow."
