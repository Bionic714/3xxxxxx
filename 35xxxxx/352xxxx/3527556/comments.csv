I'm so in need of good music ;"
,Gravian,2008-05-26T21:22Z,"Yeah, can we get some seeders? It's pretty rare to find an unsigned artist with decent talent like this and his site doesn't seem to have all his stuff. If you are looking for his site you can go here: http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=ja&u=http://www.ssh.ne.jp/&sa=X&oi=translate&resnum=5&ct=result&prev=/search%3Fq%3DSSH%2Bmusic%26num%3D100%26hl%3Den%26safe%3Doff%26client%3Dopera%26rls%3Den%26hs%3D4dN

Using the google translator for your ease. Since his site is in Japanese and alot of his stuff isn't marked in English it's easier to find stuff with the translator, even if you can't make out everything from the bad translation. If you don't like it just click view original web page."
