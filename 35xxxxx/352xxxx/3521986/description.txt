Benefits

    * Explain injuries, conditions and treatments more effectively with this
      accurate visual tool.
    * Aid your interpretation of MR by comparing the 3D model with MR slices
      in three planes.
    * Save time when you have this vast image resource for presentations,
      hand outs etc.
    * Make teaching and learning enjoyable!

Installing:
1. Insert your iso file into your virtual cd drive, then install program interactive head and neck or other from the primal3D series
2. Run program and learn!
3. That's it! It works.
(best way i found was dont mount on a virtual drive just convert to ISO using magic ISO and then use the burn ISO to cd/dvd and just use that disk...)

I will upload all of the 9cd roms and therefore please keep seeding!!
