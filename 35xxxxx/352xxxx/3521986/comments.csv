,toofan,2006-09-10T15:23Z,thanks alot man. now all we need is the head :)
,Fasthand,2006-09-10T15:48Z,"Hi Ulysses56, and thanks for this awesome contribution.
But I have a problem. Perhaps this is only due to lack of knowledge - In case please enlighten me:
The Torrents that contain an ISO-file I have no problems either boot from virtual drive or burning bavk to a CD. This is true for the Pelvis (Series 9). And it installs without problem.
The ones containing an IMG-file on the other hand, is no problem when it comes to burning it back on a CD, but this CD seems to contain nothing, and it will not boot. My computer cant recognise it.
I'm using Nero 7 for burning.
Am I doing something wrong?
And why have you made some into ISO files and others to IMG files?

Regards"

[T],ulysses56,2006-09-10T20:47Z,"To be honest, Im so tired of making copies of this wonderful series I have on my office. Its work perfect with my laptop but when I started to copy the discs I had a really tough time. Some disc is with ?copy security? and make the whole thing so difficult. If I knew that in the beginning I would never make all this effort.
But I know it will work in the end for all of you, just try and try like I did. I?m not very technical.
Take care everybody."
,Fasthand,2006-09-10T21:15Z,"Hi, It's np Ulysses56.

I can have the tecnical stuff submittet from someone else here.

It would be cool though, if you're still not to exhausted to put out the final disk (head) when ever convenient for you.

Take care, and thank you very much for the contribution!

[T],ulysses56,2006-09-10T21:21Z,"The last disc will be up tomorrow.
Anyway all the copys work with my homecomputer so I now you will also."
,Bird6,2006-09-10T22:44Z,"Thanks for sharing and your great job

,rellison,2006-09-11T00:24Z,"Ulysses
Thanks for the disks!! Just in time I daughter starts RN School this week.. Do you know what Directory the missing file go into are they in the main directory on the cd's or are thry in another directory. I looked at some of the other disks but dont see any files like those that are missing??"
[T],ulysses56,2006-09-11T00:55Z,"To rellison:
One file is a subtitlefile (in Spanish I think) for some description and the other (ccd)is just a rest of copying the disc, nothing important. If you dont need that dont border. It will work fine without.
Give my regards to your daughter hoping her schooltime will be great."
,toofan,2006-09-11T16:22Z,thanks again for this wonderfull sofwtare. cant wait for disc 5 :)

,mazdon,2006-09-17T17:57Z,"What a sad story.... hmmm
I can get some of these torrent to work... with a lot of trouble.... burning CD:s that doesent work, loading down diffrent programs that doesen´t work to crack this torrent...so sad, I really looked forward to get this torrents as I have a lot of friends that are nurses or working in that area.
But I can see that it will be far to complicated for them to manage this downloads.... so sad.... ;(

Anyway ulysses56, thanks for trying...best regards Maxthegun"
,Ironbyte,2006-10-29T19:16Z,The *.ccd file is missing
,Ironbyte,2006-10-29T19:26Z,The *.sub is also missing
,haroo,2007-05-20T12:52Z,"I too was having lots of trouble getting these programs to work, but i think i have found the solution.

For some reason, using daemon tools 4.08 only allowed me to run discs 2,3,4,5,8 and 9, but by installing the older version daemon tools 3.47 (this is available from the website), i was able to get the whole series working by mounting the .img/.iso file with safedisc emulation (missing files torrent is not neccessary). Hope this helps others having trouble.

also to those who dontt like the files taking up their hard drive (neither do i) just burn all the files onto one disc using nero express (so that the .iso/.img files remain as .iso/.img files) and run the programs through daemon tools directly off the disc. abit slower but saves space:)

A huge thanks to ulysses56 for these! I highly recommend these programs, they have helped me hugely with my studies as a med student"
,Alexiito,2009-02-05T17:34Z,"Hi have solved the problem!

Konvert all de sec. (knee, hip,shoulder, etc) to iso. file with poweriso! 
Extraxt them to new folder.
Then mount them with alcohol 120% (NOT the HIP, KNEE or SHOULDER!!)
And every time you would like to use one of the programs mount them with Alcohol120%

And for the KNEE, HIP and SHOULDERS mount them with Daemon tools Lite but you´ll have to set the ""emulation settings"" on ALL OPTIONS ON!! (safedisc,securom,laserrom and etc!!
and its the same there, you´ll have to mount them on daemon tools if you want to use them.

PS: the HAND program doesn´t work for me. It ask for appsetup.txt

I´ve hope I have helped you!! =D"
,bobmarley2,2010-10-25T21:52Z,"So how have people got this to work.  Done everything that LordP666 said and still can't get the program to find appsetup.txt.

Is there another way???  Would love to get this working"
