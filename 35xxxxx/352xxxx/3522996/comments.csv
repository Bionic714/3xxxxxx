,IceMaster,2006-10-12T19:04Z,"Although, it would be much better to upload them separately.  Not everyone wants every game or has 10.2 GB free to download them.  Or feels like waiting a week, for that matter."
,l0cke,2006-10-13T11:20Z,You don't have to download every game. If you have azureus for example you can choose which game you want to download
,raonielfo,2006-10-22T08:54Z,Not all games from square to PSX... There are some missing games
,l0cke,2006-10-22T20:44Z,There are some rpg games only released in Japan and some fighting games released by squaresoft but I only meant squaresoft rpg games translated to english. If I have missed any of those please let me know

,stordanne,2006-11-20T09:05Z,Is this for playstation 1?
,juggalo_pirate,2006-12-27T10:44Z,"can more people seed please, or its gonna take 350 days for me.... i dont wanna wait that long T.T"
,VinceIP,2006-12-27T16:39Z,"Chrono Cross is only 600 something MB? Maybe 7z files are just compressed super well... But these games contain all the CDs, right?

Anyway, this is great, I don't care how long it'll take to download (I'm getting about 20 kb/s). I've looked all over ROM sites and stuff for these, but no one has them. Best share. Ever."
,l0cke,2007-01-04T12:55Z,Yes of course the 7zip files contains all the cds

,l0cke,2008-05-28T18:18Z,Yes but that's because atlus not squaresoft made the game
,Not_1,2008-06-07T12:45Z,"Doesn't have Chocobo Racing, good torrent otherwise"

,Acedoble,2008-06-08T15:10Z,If this has ff6 PAL someone let me know and i will download. My email is jace_6280@hotmail.com
,VincentCraven,2008-06-16T20:32Z,"For some reason, 7-Zip isn't opening FF7 or FF8. It reads ""could not open ____(file) as archive."" Is it because they contain multiple discs? Anybody else have this problem or know how to fix this?"
,l0cke,2008-06-16T22:09Z,Try downloading winrar at www.rarlabs.com or a newer version of 7zip at www.7-zip.org
,7kindsofsmoke,2008-12-10T23:56Z,seed please.
,jesterkng,2009-07-07T03:32Z,"/me bangs his head on his desk, because people aren't seeding... 2 seeders... :("
