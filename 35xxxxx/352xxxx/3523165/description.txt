X-Com Enforcer is a third person game built with the Unreal Tournament engine. Unlike some of the other titles in the X-Com series, Enforcer should appeal more to the run and gun action crowd. The player takes control of an android that will be deployed throughout the world to fill in where X-Com's forces cannot go.

FREE LOOK
---------
This is an unsupported feature!!!  X-COM ENFORCER was designed with fixed camera 
perspectives in mind, and players were never intended to be able to look up.  Most 
players have found the standard camera more than sufficient for the style of play,
but a few still said they wanted the capability, notably for DeathMatch games.  Please
keep in mind that if you choose to use Free Look, you are viewing and playing the game 
as it was NOT intended to be viewed or played.

To bind a key to Free Look;

1.  Locate and open the X-COM ENFORCER directory found on your hard drive.  The default
    location for this folder is: C:/Program Files/Infogrames Interactive/X-COM ENFORCER.
2.  Locate and open the SYSTEM directory found within the X-COM ENFORCER directory.
3.  Locate and open the file labeled "USER.INI".  (If you have yet to run the game 
    successfully and are unable to find this file, open the "DEFUSER.INI" instead.)
4.  Scroll down until you see the section that lists the key assignments (first few lines
    below):

    LeftMouse=Fire
    RightMouse=Look
    MiddleMouse=
    Tab=
    Enter=
    etc. etc. etc.

5.  Locate the key or button that you'd like to use for Free Look.
6.  Change or add to the line following the "=" to so that it reads (ex.);

    RightMouse=XFreeLook

6.  Save and close the file.
7.  Run X-COM ENFORCER.

To bind a key to toggle Free Look on and off (rather than having to hold the button down),
follow the above directions, using "XFreeLookToggle" instead of "XFreeLook".

MANUAL CORRECTIONS, ADDITIONS, MULTIPLAYER & MISC.
--------------------------------------------------

Purple Identifier Rings beneath Weapons and Power-Ups
-----------------------------------------------------
Occasionally during missions, you will come across an item with purple identifier rings 
beneath it instead of the standard red and yellow ones.  These purple rings indicate that 
the Weapon or Power-Up has yet to be unlocked on the R&D screen.  If you try out the item 
and like its capabilities, collect Data Points and Unresearched Objects to unlock it and 
make it regularly available during play!

Information on the Aliens, Weapons and Power-Ups

---MULTIPLAYER---
   
X-COM ENFORCER offers full Cooperative and DeathMatch Multiplayer Modes; find the game 
that's right for you!  Be sure to Choose Your Enforcer (accessible through the Multiplayer
Menu) before Joining or Hosting a Multiplayer game.


Finding and Joining a Multiplayer Game
--------------------------------------
To find and join a Multiplayer game, first make sure that you've got a connection to
the internet (or to your Local Area Network for LAN games).  Once that's been established, 
run X-COM ENFORCER.  Select the Multiplayer option from the Main Menu, then select Join 
Game from the Multiplayer Menu.  This should bring up a browser with a list of games.

Click on the LAN tab for LAN games, or the Internet tab for internet games.  Once you've
found a game you'd like to join, simply double click on the game in the browser, or click
to highlight it and press Enter to join that game.


Hosting a Multiplayer Game
--------------------------
To Host a Multiplayer game, first make sure that you've got a connection to the internet
(or to your Local Area Network for LAN games).  Once that's been established, run X-COM
ENFORCER.  Select the Multiplayer option from the Main Menu, then select Host Game from
the Multiplayer Menu.  This should bring up a menu with three tabs; MATCH, RULES, and 
SERVER (information below).  Once you're happy with these settings, simply click on the
START button in the lower right corner of this menu to launch your game.

Under the MATCH tab, you may select the Game Type, the Maps used, and any Mutators you may
wish to have for the game you're creating.  

Game Type:  This allows you to choose between a Cooperative or DeathMatch game.  This 
            option will determine the maps available for each mode of play.  See below 
            under "Incorporating and Naming User-Created..." for more information on this.

Map Name and Map List:  The Map Name and Map List options allow you to set which maps your
                        Multiplayer game cycles through.  After clicking on the Map List
                        button, you are presented with two windows representing the maps
                        that are and aren't cycled through.  Clicking on a map's name in 
                        one window will move it to the other.

Mutators:  Clicking on the Mutator button will present you with a list of available 
           Mutators for your game.  Mutators define certain gameplay parameters for all 
           players, and frequently alter the way a game is played.  The Mutators that come
           with X-COM ENFORCER include modifiers such as "Run Fast", "Jump High", "No 
           Nukes" and "Minimum Upgrade Level 1-4".

Under the RULES tab you may establish limits and other settings for the game.  The 
options available will change based on your selection of either Cooperative or DeathMatch 
play under the MATCH tab (see above).

For DeathMatch play, you can set your game's Max Players, Frag Limit, and Time Limit.
For Cooperative play, in addition to setting the game's Max Players you are able to
select the game's level of Difficulty, Exit Timer Bonus, and Friendly Fire setting.

Max Players:  This sets the maximum number of players allowed to join your game.

Frag Limit:  This determines the amount of kills it takes to win a match.  When a match
             is won, the game will reset the scores and cycle to the next map (or restart
             the map, if no others are set to be cycled).  [DM only]

Time Limit:  Instead or in addition to the Frag Limit, you may set a Time Limit to
             determine when the match ends.  [DM only]

Difficulty:  This slider allows you to set the game's Difficulty level, the left side
             representing the easiest game and the right side representing the hardest.
             We reccomend adjusting this slider in relation to the number of players
             expected or allowed to play for the best balance possible.  [Coop only]

Exit Timer Bonus:  Once all of a map's objectives have been completed, the established
                   Exit Timer Bonus will be displayed and start to decrease.  This is a 
                   special Data Point Bonus awarded to players as they exit the map 
                   through the teleportation platform.  The sooner the platform is reached,
                   the more Data Points are awarded to that player. [Coop only]

Friendly Fire:  This checkbox determines whether or not players' can hurt eachother.  If
                you want to be able to shoot other players in addition to the aliens, make
                sure this box is checked. [Coop only]
           
Under the SERVER tab, you may set information and parameters about the game server you're 
creating.  This includes the names and information you want displayed, as well as specific
settings for LAN and Internet play.

Optimize for LAN:  Check this box to get the best performance from LAN games.

Advertise:  To have your game appear under the list of Internet servers, make sure this 
            box is checked.  Otherwise, other players connecting through the Internet 
            won't be able to see and join your game.


GameSpy and GameSpy Arcade
--------------------------

X-COM ENFORCER uses GameSpy's Master Server to track its internet games.  If you are a
GameSpy or GameSpy Arcade user, you may join X-COM ENFORCER using GameSpy's software.  
If you don't use GameSpy or GameSpy Arcade but would like to, you can find downloadable
versions of the software at http://www.gamespy.com and http://www.gamespyarcade.com.


Incorporating and Naming User-Created Cooperative and Death Match Maps
----------------------------------------------------------------------
To make user-created maps available for play, you must first place them in the X-COM 
ENFORCER "MAPS" folder.  The default installation directory for this folder is 
c:\program files\infogrames interactive\x-com enforcer\maps.

To make a map appear in the Cooperative map list, its filename must begin with "map"
(example: Map03.xcm).  For a map to appear in the list of Death Match maps, its filename
must begin with "dm" (example: DM_Sewers01.xcm).


Playing a Single Player Game with User-Created Maps
---------------------------------------------------
If you would like to play a Single Player game with user-created maps, simply Host a
Cooperative Multiplayer game and make sure that "Advertise Server" is NOT checked under
the MATCH tab.  Clicking the "Map List" button (also under the MATCH tab) enables you
to set which maps your game will cycle through.  



V.
PERFORMANCE
-----------

To improve game performance, go to the game's Options Menu and try lowering settings such
as texture detail, sound quality and screen resolution.  You may also wish to change your 
Video Driver, though X-COM ENFORCER will automatically attempt to detect your system's
optimal settings.

Memory
------
X-COM ENFORCER's performance is highly dependent on the amount of RAM you have in your 
machine, and the amount of memory that is available.  Machines with less memory will 
access their hard disk more frequently to load data, which causes sporadic pauses in 
gameplay.  Thus, if you have a 32 megabyte (or less) machine, you should make sure that 
you don't have other unnecessary programs loaded in memory when playing X-COM ENFORCER.

How the game will perform under different RAM conditions: 
+ 32 megabytes or less: A lot of swapping, marginally playable. 
+ 48 megabytes: Some swapping; use the Video Options to select "low texture detail" to 
  improve this. 
+ 64 megabytes: Great, with a bit of swapping. 
+ 128 megabytes: Oh Yes!

CPU Speed
---------
The game is also very sensitive to CPU speed, memory bandwidth, and cache performance. 
Thus, it runs far better on leading-edge processors such as Pentium II's than it does on 
older ones such as non-MMX Pentiums.
