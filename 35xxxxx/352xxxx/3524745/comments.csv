,gjesme473,2006-09-19T01:05Z,There is something wrong with VTS_06_1.....burning to dvd is a problem because of that.   Opening the folder with power dvd is playble but can't burn and watch it on tv.
,Qella,2006-09-28T17:49Z,"Yeah, I can't burn it either. Very upset. I'd like to enjoy it on my couch, not on my office chair.
Help???

How (if possible) do I burn the ones that are like 105 dvd.r files?"
,ppv2006,2006-09-29T00:18Z,"Nero gave me warning too but after ignoring it I got a DVD that was playable on my player. Another option is just put a dummy set of files ( eg from another movie ) in place of the VTS_06... set. This way I did not even get a warning from Nero.
Great movie!"
