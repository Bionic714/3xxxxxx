,Crillie,2006-09-10T12:27Z,This is a great game one of the first ones I bought. However it´s a hell getting it to work on XP. For me using dos box doesn´t solve the video problem. Give it a try though its a great fun game.
,urmamma,2006-09-10T12:50Z,Great game!
,Lexus555,2006-09-10T13:09Z,I plan to upload some other classics if I can find them. I remember I had Duke Nukem 3D and Xenophage somewhere...
,gentlemanthief,2006-09-11T02:08Z,I've downloaded this game on a few other occasions and whenever its a CD rip its listed at half a gig (demo's other crap).
,Lexus555,2006-09-11T15:08Z,"Yes, this is the full version ripped straight from CD, and it is 533 MB in size.

Which shouldn't come as a surprise considering the game's age. :-)

By the way, if anyone finds out a way to make this work properly under XP, please post a solution here. DOSBox doesn't do the trick for me."

,grf0,2007-03-24T05:21Z,"####ATTENTION######
i solved the problem by setting up the proper
sound blaster setting that can be found at the 
start of the dosbox or in the dosbox.conf
file that is located at: 
start\dosbox-0.70\dosbox.conf
check out for the tag : [sblaster]
should be like this for default:
sbtype=sb16
sbbase=220
irq=7
dma=1
hdma=5
mixer=true
oplmode=auto
oplrate=22050

in setup.exe in death rally folder try this
soundblaster\pro\16\awe... 
then 220
thwn irq7
then dma1
save and exit and try to hf

,grf0,2007-03-24T05:22Z,"note:
