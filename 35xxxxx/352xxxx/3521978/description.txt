Who doesn't remember the good ol' days when Games looked awful, sounded even worse, but were actually fun to no end?

Death Rally is one of such classics. A top-down view racing game, it features six cars which you can equip with chain guns, mine dispensers, armor and much more in order to be the first one over the finish line. There are no rules.

Installation:

Unrar, mount the ISO with Daemon Tools (or your preferred program). Originally, you would then navigate to D:\RALLY\ (where D is your CD drive letter) and run SETUP.EXE, but I haven't been able to get the game running under Windows XP that way.

While I have no personal experience with it, I hear DOSBox is the solution to running old DOS games with Windows. You can check it out at

Above all, have fun!
