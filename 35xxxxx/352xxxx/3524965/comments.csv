,oblachubs,2006-09-21T03:36Z,Why bother uploading this if you didn't intend to seed it?  It's only 47% or are you not done uploading?  Please advise.
,Kram Ocramed,2006-09-24T01:56Z,"Hey, i'm front he demonoid torrent. And i'm seeding at 100kb/s+. Enjoy."
,Kram Ocramed,2006-09-24T01:58Z,"Forgot to mention.

Marathons and Survivals DO WORK. You just have to set it to 2 players, even if there is no one playing that side, you still have to have it set to 2 players. Then it will work.

Extras menu takes you to to Options Menu.
Edit Mode doesnt work/is bugged."
,Kram Ocramed,2006-09-24T02:03Z,"Ok, it might be listing me as a leacher. But thats only because I dont have the readme file. And thats it. You will still receive the game."
,j1ng,2006-09-24T21:27Z,"omg, it stoped at 99.9%"
