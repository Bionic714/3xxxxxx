BETA version of Roxor Games' In The Groove 2 for Playstation 2.

Some modes and meuns don't work properly. Marathon and survival modes work but the game crashes when you either finish or fail the course. Don't play any songs that are missing audio otherwise the game will crash. 

Other strange bugs exist too. Just look around for them.

If you'd like to help seed this is the same as the Demonoid torrent that was up a few weeks ago except for the .txt file being replaced. 

Please seed seed seed!
