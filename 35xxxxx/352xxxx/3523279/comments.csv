,Yadott,2006-09-13T23:35Z,"Stop this 911 stuff, many of us get sick of this conspiracy shit!

Ask if TPB give you own section for only this shit so we others don't have to stumble on it all the time. We do not like to be brainwashed as you in us."
,meowing,2006-09-14T21:28Z,"It is exactly because of love for America that these movies are made, you idiot.

This one is a lot better than others I've seen. As a rule of thumb you can remember: The later the film was released, the better the facts are.

And no, they are NOT conspiracy theories, just fact. Exactly like http://www.cooperativeresearch.org/timeline.jsp?timeline=complete_911_timeline&startpos=777"

,norwman,2006-10-14T12:45Z,"It's about time that theese films lost the ""conspiracy"" stamp, and be seen for what they are. (for the most part)
They ask questions about things that has not been answered. THAT'S WHAT THEY DO!
And if american goverment, CIA and military can't answer some of theese questions, then something is definitiv wrong!
So keep em' coming, because then people won't forget.

,Osaka,2006-10-19T21:55Z,"Yes, agreed, they're not conspiracies.. 

However, under dictatorships like the US Government, just asking ""questions about things that has not been answered"" IS considered to be conspiring."
