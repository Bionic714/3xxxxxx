http://gh.ffshrine.org/soundtracks/2438

And the Sound Invitation Promo here:
http://gh.ffshrine.org/soundtracks/2367

You'll have to download each song manually, only 6 simultaneous downloads but hey, anything's better than nothing.
I can't make this torrent read my ost as valid due to different filesize/mp3 quality so you'll have to drop it.."
