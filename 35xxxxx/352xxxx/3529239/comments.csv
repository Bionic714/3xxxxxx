I've been looking for a functioning torrent for this for a while. It's good to see it uploaded here in the Freaky Flicks collection. Thanks.

,pialightwave,2007-10-18T08:02Z,"VLC's codex doesn't work. I'm getting a scramble corrupted file. Unwatchable... 

Unfortunately until this file can be verified, it should be removed.

Unless someone knows the trick to making it play correctly.
