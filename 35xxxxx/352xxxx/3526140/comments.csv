,northern lad,2007-04-05T02:32Z,"Why has this Torrent downloaded over 99% of the file and then stopped?   I own the music on album and upload twice as much bandwidth for twice the time as I download, so I feel I am fulfilling my share of the compact.  I'm therefore disappointed at not being able to listen to old favourites on my new Ipod"
