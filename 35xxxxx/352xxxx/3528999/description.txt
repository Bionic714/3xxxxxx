Nautilus combines the talents of Ralf Obel, (Sampler, Synthesiser, 
Sequencer), and Martin Ludwig, (Keyboards, Synthesiser, Sequencer). 
Beginning with the gentle 'Message of the Earth' the music's warmth 
envelopes you, evoking peaceful, tranquil meditation. Guest musician 
Werner Stratz's understated, melodic, Rother-like guitar phrases are 
backed by lush synth pads and sequencers.

'Express To Nowhere' features a tentative piano refrain, voice 
samples, and percussion before a fast marimba-like sequence kicks in 
with sprightly rhythms and provide a frenetic backdrop to some 
percussive effects and keyboard solos. Probably one of the less 
convincing tracks on offer on the set. 'Iceland' returns to Berlin School 
sensibilities with slowly building synth pads sequencers and atmosphere 
รก la Arcanum. As on the first track Stratz's electric guitar is used to 
good effect before the gentle finale. 'Mysterious Underworld', inspired 
by Jules Verne's 'Journey To The Centre of the Earth', features some 
sprightly sequencer work, after a suitably evocative opening, and 
sustained melodic keyboard phrases and Berlin School trademarks in 
the first part 'Mushroom Garden', and rockier rhythms, whale sounds, 
and female Russian voice in the slightly less convincing second part, 
'The Big Ocean'. 'On the Beach' continues the aquatic theme a little 
more convincingly here, set against rock rhythms, and unusually for 
the album, minimalist melodic interest courtesy of repetitive ambient 
textures.

'The Source of Life' returns to the faster sequencers, and more 
accessible melodies and rhythms, spoiled in places, for me, by some 
rather primitive percussion treatments and annoying voice samples. 
'Volcano Ride' is one of the more impressive cuts featuring again, 
some excellent sequencer work and melodic backdrops. 'Back On 
Earth' slows the pace a little, but the sequencers are still high in the 
mix, this time underpinned with a steady incessant beat, and 
accompanied by effectively understated melodies. Finally, 'Earthdance' 
starts with a frankly disastrous dance rhythm and funky horn effects. 
There is even a deeply annoying whistle, oft deployed on dance 
records, which will either have you reaching for the off button, or a 
shotgun. Just as you think it can't get worse an annoying voice 
sample featured on an earlier track reappears again. However, things 
begin to get better after the four minute mark, as only the better 
elements of the rhythm track remain behind supporting understated, 
melancholic keyboard work. Although I found this to be an uneven 
set, the highpoints outnumber the lows and this will be of interest to 
fans of melodic Berlin School New Age electronics.
