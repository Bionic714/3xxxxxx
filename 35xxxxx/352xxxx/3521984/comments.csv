,jchan1985,2006-10-02T06:48Z,how do I use the .cso file?...
,fussler69,2006-11-28T20:45Z,"Hi all. It took me some time to figure out how to do this
p$p thing right. Nobody says anywhere on any site how to exactly. Well I think also stupid people should pay for games anyhow. But here is a tip.

1. upgrade     >  2.71
2. Downgrade < 1.50 
3. then upgrade > 2.71 SE-B or C 
4. install DevHook for 2.71-2.80 *latest
5. load games with DevHook
6. If the game needs 2.** or so load with Fastloader.

easy as ""abc"""
,Zepski,2007-01-22T22:53Z,"Or you can follow http://www.noobz.eu/joomla/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=35&Itemid=1

and downgrade any psp including the ta-082 and the ta-086 to 1.5

then if you want you can update to 3.03 oe-b and not even have to bother with devhook (you can upgrade from 2.71 se too)"
,hero2u,2007-01-28T07:27Z,just downgradeyour psp to 1.50fw then get the custom fw 3.03oe-a (the latest one is 3.03oe-c)
,xxELITE_CH4Dxx,2007-03-29T11:06Z,"ok, first of all u dont need custom fw, but u need devhook or a umd emu. if your gunna use devhook make a folder called ISO on the root of ur mem stick then go in to dev hook and click umd select then find the game u want.

1.50>2.00>2.50>2.80>2.81>3.03>1.50"
