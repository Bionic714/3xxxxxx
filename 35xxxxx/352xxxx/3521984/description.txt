LocoRoco plunges you into a colourful world where jelly-like creatures (LocoRoco) sing, roll and bounce their way through levels to reach their goals. Guide your LocoRoco through the various worlds using a simple tilting and bouncing gameplay mechanic -? using the PSP system's Left and Right shoulder buttons to tilt the ground up to about 30 degrees in either direction. The jelly-like LocoRoco don't stay still -- guide these little characters as they bounce, roll and jump their way to the goal, avoiding splinters and enemies.
