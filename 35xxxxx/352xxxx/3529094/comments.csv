Subscription Expiration: 3 years.
Sounds to good to be truth"
,kanye,2006-09-26T07:28Z,GREAT
,kanye,2006-09-26T14:53Z,"but somehow u cant just install the firewall, you need to do all at once, and i disabled the virus protection cos i got another app but it always restarts it in mcafee..other then that its good."
,volpoid,2006-09-26T14:55Z,It is too good to be true - the archive is corrupt!
,freeprogram,2006-09-26T15:52Z,"Go to add/remove program to click uninstall McAfee then just select what u do not want.
So easy........."
,jonnydoe555,2006-10-08T02:36Z,"To donkeymand: After installing this app, the Security Center stated that my subscription expires on 5/9/2018... Verifying Subscription is ok (and necessary to update).

Update instructions: Click the 'Update' button, wait several minutes for completion. Restart your system. Click the 'Update' button once again to update the other components, restart your system again.  ---You will now be up-to-date.

Thank You so very much 'freeprogram' for this torrent!"
,RapbYy,2006-10-13T18:38Z,is this a scam or virus?
,RapbYy,2006-10-13T18:38Z,is northon or MacFever better? 
,jonnydoe555,2006-10-14T06:17Z,"To answer both questions RapbYy....

This File is NOT a scam or virus. So get it now while there are a lot of seeds.

McAfee Internet Security Suite 2007 is the BEST virus scan and firewall for home use, nothing better... Norton can suck a nut! (I've never heard of MacFever)"

,jonnydoe555,2006-10-25T14:24Z,"I've downloaded this torrent twice, and it never asks for a password...EVER!"
,shagster,2006-10-25T20:49Z,ok guys i put this on my comp and it fucked it up took ages to load from start any program i wanted to run took ages to run and when on the internet it was mega slow alot of times it said server not found???  iv now deleted all of this and reinstalled the older mcafee firewall and virus scan i had and everything is perfect again so there might be virus or somehting hidden in this crap.my comp aint no shitty 40 quid job either and i did check all the settings in the security center so who knows ??????
,jonnydoe555,2006-10-26T01:27Z,"It runs just fine on my PC, maybe your system just isn't compatible with the newer McAfee. And aside from the cracked .exe and moded registery (both for the for crack), there aren't any other modification to the app, witch has been cloned from the original disc. And once again, I have downloaded it twice and have installed it on several PCs and it works wonderfuly. There are no passwords required EVER, it dose not slow anything down, and now the Security Center is stating that my subscription expires 1/23/2055. So any problems anyone is having, it is because of YOUR PC!!!"
,jonnydoe555,2006-10-27T09:20Z,"[Thinking to myself]... You can alway tell who the people are that don't know dick about PCs, they alway bash McAfee... hmmm?"
,jonnydoe555,2006-10-28T09:55Z,You caught me!!! You've managed to deduce that the only possible way I can have an opinion is if someone pays me to... WOW! You really are quite amazing to have figured all of that out simply by reading a message board. Props dude!
,SAHIBVIRK,2006-10-30T10:12Z,"where is the three year subscription

itasks me to subscribe online
says the product is not subscribed...
help    what to do ?"
,Godey,2006-10-30T11:21Z,"I downloaded it, instaled and everything works fine. But there is this red buttom at the right notification area telling me my computer is not protected altho i have already verified my subscription. can anyone help"
,jonnydoe555,2006-10-30T12:02Z,"This is the 100% complete install guide

1. Be sure there are no other McAfee components current on your system.

2. Run the install, after all components are installed it will automatically validate the install (not the subscription).

3. It will ask you if you would like to send unanimous information to McAfee to improve it's services. You MUST respond 'No'.

4. McAfee will start it's services, shorty after that it will send an icon to your system tray stating that your system is not protected. Double click the main McAfee icon and wait until it loads the Security Center.

5. Click  ""Verify Your Subscription"" located to the right.

***Now here's where it gets a little tricky***

6. Some times it will verify the subscription and all the services will turn on automatically, but other times the prompt in the lower right corner will state that the subscription has been verified but you need to renew the subscription... DON""T      PANIC!

7. At the main screen of the Security Center, click on the ""Update"" button in the upper left. Wait SEVERAL minutes for the update to complete.

8. After witch; restart your system and all services should be running just fine.

Aside from that, you may experience different results.

WARNING!!!
If after the initial install, McAfee doesn't verify the install. It may not have installed properly (Go through steps 4-8 anyway just in case). This is NOT due to user error, the app just didn't apply the correct reg-mods and or cracks. Also, if you are running a registry protector such as Lavasoft's ""Ad-Watch"" (An excellent app) you will be prompted SEVERAL times to accept or block registry mods. Accept them as fast as they come, this will help ensure a proper install.

I hope this helped."
,jonnydoe555,2006-10-30T12:39Z,"Sorry... I forgot one last thing. If all of that didn't work, then completely uninstall all of McAfee's components and reinstall it using my guide. If you have any further question regarding McAfee or Ad-Watch, you can e-mail me at britid2k1@aol.com"
,jonnydoe555,2006-10-31T11:29Z,OH!! I see that you think you got your time machine working... The file has been removed due to T.O.S. violation.
,lostfan,2006-11-01T15:10Z,"It seems to be working fine and it says subscription til 2079 or something but is there any way to get rid of the renewal part, I have tried all the updates and the verify part jonnydoe555 said but it wont go away! Does this mean its not actually working??"
,lostfan,2006-11-01T16:39Z,Was it right that when I went to updates it had no available updates?? Is it supposed to originally not ollow the updates to work??
,jonnydoe555,2006-11-02T00:08Z,"You cannot update until you verify your subscription (even if it gives you that renewal crap). But just l said if after installing using steps 1-8 then completely uninstall all of McAfee's components and reinstall it using my guide. this could take a few tries and it is a pain in the ass. Rather it be the version of McAfee or the cracked version, one of them is severely bugged. "

,tdawg83,2006-11-02T19:49Z,I just got a quick question....it told me that i had to get rid of ad-ware se personal....and that the virus scan wasn't gonna be installed.....is this the right program i want? 
,jonnydoe555,2006-11-03T07:14Z,The newest version of Ad-Aware should be compatible with McAfee Internet Security Suite 2007. It was on my system. So try and DL it.
,oliver202,2006-11-08T15:32Z,"On my pc i've got expiration date 13/01/2081, yet it still says to verify subscription and renew"

,yoleven,2006-11-11T17:46Z,Works good for me.  Thanks for the program.
,o0Gizmo0o,2006-11-12T01:50Z,Okay Jonnydoe555. Should i renew after i have verified or what? Haven't understand it 100% i think.
,jonnydoe555,2006-11-13T02:38Z,"You never renew, that means purchasing McAfee.
You install, it verifies installation, you open and click  ""Verify Subscription"", say 'no' when prompted to renew, update, and restart PC."
,o0Gizmo0o,2006-11-13T23:30Z,"well, now it just keeps saying that i should verify.. And my computer isn't protected.. 

What should i do?"
,jonnydoe555,2006-11-14T19:55Z,"Just like I said before about the install, ""this could take a few tries and it is a pain in the ass. Rather it be the version of McAfee or the cracked version, one of them is severely bugged."""
,dee2may,2006-11-14T21:59Z,"Hi Jonnydoe555,

I've installed McAfee with help of your guide (thank you very much for that), and the subscription expiration is now somewhere in 2081. Still, McAfee keeps telling me that my computer is not protected. I need to renew my subscription for both the virusscanner aswell as the firewall. Should I ignore this message (your computer is not protected), and think that everything is working ok because of the subscription expiration? What do you recommend?"
,Foky,2006-11-15T04:38Z,i guess i missed the guide to this or i just overlooked it but either way i can not seem to find it. Can you help me out?
,jonnydoe555,2006-11-15T05:02Z,It's on the first page of this board.
,Foky,2006-11-15T05:08Z,"thanks man,  i found it right after i asked."
,o0Gizmo0o,2006-11-15T14:23Z,"Jonnydoe555 , I got the same problems as dee2may.. 

Send you an e-mail and a message here on TPB.. 

what should i do ? :) "
,jonnydoe555,2006-11-17T07:37Z,"To dee2may & o0Gizmo0o:

Although my guide is the best way to install this cracked version of McAfee, it my take a few tries (This is a HUGE pain in the ass). But after each failed attempt, make sure that you have completely uninstalled McAfee and ALL of it's components (Don't restart yet, even if McAfee tells you to), this means going into your ""Programs"" list in your C:/ drive and deleting the ""McAfee"" folder (Some times merely unstalling an app doesn't delete the program's folder, where certain DLLs and other program settings are storing for future installs). After that you MUST restart your system (Even if McAfee didn't prompt you to). The follow the guide... Again, THIS MAY TAKE SEVERAL ATTEMPTS.

,rambro,2007-08-02T19:07Z,"Guys... ask yourselves this ..
why does it take so many attempts and reboots to get this application installed?
I had McAfeee 2006 Internet suite and wanted the 2007 version. After uninstalling the 2006 version using Add/Remove, I restarted my PC and attempted the first of 5 installs of this cracked 2007 version, following 
After each attempt my PC started to act progressively worse. 
I spent 6 hours undoing all the Cryto dll hacks ""freeprogram"" intruduced....

You cannot compromise your PC at this level. It's the only investment you should carefully choose and invest wisely in, especially if you are going to download from this site.

I now have a legit version of McAfee 2007.
