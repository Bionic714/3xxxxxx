,Cobra_Venom,2006-09-24T11:41Z,"A Typo in the discription.
It says it's nog The Sims 2.
But it should be it's NOT The Sims 2."
,Bolbey,2006-09-24T12:34Z,You are missing at least one expansion pack :P
,Cobra_Venom,2006-09-24T14:29Z,"Maybe i am. I don't know.
I don't know how many expansionspack
they released to The Sims 1.
But here's atleast The Sims one with
6 Expansionspack aldready installed
in the game. That's why it's just 3cd's.
But the cd's are in .EXE format.
So you install from the .EXE files. But
it works fine :)"
,kotÃ©diwa,2006-09-26T00:21Z,Is it working with a french version of the game??
,Cobra_Venom,2006-09-26T08:32Z,"It's The Sims 1 with the expansionspack
installed in the game. So you install the game
and the expansionspack gets installed at the same
time. So it's not the expansionspack's not seperate.
It's all in one package :)"

,Cobra_Venom,2006-10-05T18:13Z,"As Hardsu wrote.
Click on the EN.reg and choose YES when it ask if it should be saved in the registry. Then you have it in English. As far as the other problem goes. Try shutting down other programs while you run it. Sometimes it helps."

,krangksh,2006-11-14T04:00Z,"I have downloaded and installed this file, but it is completely screwed. As soon as I enter a particular property, all the menus and etc are covered up by repeated sections of the screen. When I move my mouse around, it brings up randomly sized rectangles of other parts of the screen that cover most of the viewable area. This is a brand new $2000 laptop so I don't think its my computer. anyone have any ideas? as it is now, its 100% useless, not to mention it overwrote my old copy of the sims."
,Zell_k,2006-11-22T06:10Z,"PS Dudes, it's traditional Chinese, hence the TC.reg file you will see in addition to the EN.reg that you use to make it English.

,HighlyC,2008-01-17T00:19Z,"When I try to run the EN.reg file, I get an error saying it's not a registration Script.

ANy ideas on how to fix?

Otherwise, good DL"
,HighlyC,2008-01-20T00:32Z,"Nevermind, fixed it myself.  If you have trouble with the ENreg script.  Simply right click the start button, explore, click C, windows, and look for regedit in the windows folder.  Open Reg edit, go to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE, then software, maxis, the sims.  On the window to the right, you should see SIMS_LANGUAGE.  Double click it, and type English, as the value data, instead of TraditionalChinese.  Click OK, exit Regedit.

Run The Sims.  Should be in English now, but the names of existing Sims will be messed up.

Still good a dl to me."
,HighlyC,2008-01-20T00:43Z,XP users should click the Maxis folder once regedit is open.  There will be no HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE folder.

It works fine for me, at first it keeps loading and loading all over again, but when i tried to edit its compatibility mode into WIN XP SP 2 it loaded faster than before. Just wanna help, for the language problem: When using vista/win 7 Go to START -> SEARCH PROGRAM AND FILES(search bar) type REGEDIT -> find HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE -> SOFTWARE -> MAXIS -> THE SIMS -> DOUBLE CLICK IT THEN FIND SIMS_LANGUAGE (Right Click and Modify) then CHANGE IT TO ENGLISH instead of TraditionalChinese then click OK. then HOLA! The Software Language can be played in ENGLISH :)

for the COMPATIBILITY MODE: Right Click the SIMS.EXE or SIMS then select PROPERTIES -> tab on top choose COMPATIBILITY -> Find RUN THIS PROGRAM IN COMPATIBILITY MODE FOR: -> choose WINDOWS XP SP2 (Service Pack 2) then APPLY. then you'll be able to play it fine :)

That's all! :D"
