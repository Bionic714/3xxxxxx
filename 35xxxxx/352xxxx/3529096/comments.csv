Previous was only McAfee Internet Security Suite 2007, nothing more."
,freeprogram,2006-09-25T17:15Z,"Sorry this is McAfee VirusScan PLUS 2007 Full.

I also uploaded McAfee Internet Security Suite 2007 Full 8-In-1."
,Stone_Sour,2006-09-25T21:12Z,"Do you know why McAfee Internet Security Suite 2007 Full 8-In-1 (37 MiB) is less big than McAfee VirusScan PLUS 2007 Full (58.92 MiB) ?
That is not logic !

,Yadott,2006-09-26T00:28Z,"Total bulls*it, it is 1 year and you have ti give some e-mail when registering. I dont believe this is cracked."
,freeprogram,2006-09-26T03:13Z,"The different between McAfee 2007 & 2006 are:
McAfee 2006 can register it by any email.
McAfee 2007 are not able to register by any email, that why we need a valid email to register it."
