Included are one hundred and ninety-one pictures depicting the horrors of ABU GHRAIB (political cartoons, tortured Iraqi detainees and raped women) and one Nick Berg decapitation video. See for yourself what your taxes are doing abroad. 
 Do you really think this is an accident, a tangent affair? Think again. The CIA and others abuse people lawlessly with no mercy or remorse.  Sure, why would the MPs act differently, if ?advisors? come in torture, kill and are untouchable?  No one is willing to take responsibility, sadly the bunch of hicks who took the pictures are just a drop in the bucket of suffering. When you see one cockroach, you can be sure there?re 20 you don?t see. The principal is the same here, for every photo taken; atrocity exposed, you can be sure there are 20 more that go undetected.
