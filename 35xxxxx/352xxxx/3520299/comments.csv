,natefrogg,2006-09-06T20:22Z,"finally! thank you! i was wondering wheny you guys would get tired of your servers being slammed, haha, good idea to torrent the downloads =) thank you!!"
,mcdownloads,2006-09-06T22:57Z,"no problem. it wasn't an issue with not wanting to do torrents, it was a case of not really knowing how :-) I think I figured it out now though, obviously ;-)"
,mcdownloads,2006-09-06T22:58Z,"p.s. were just doing it from mc2 for now, i'll do the others tomorrow night assuming this one runs well enough until then."
,highlandr,2006-09-07T02:00Z,Well I for one am glad you guys got a torrent up.  I thought I'd never get into the FTP server...
,natefrogg,2006-09-08T00:20Z,"it's all good man, i'm really glad you guys hooked up the torrent though...truth be told, i've never setup a torrent for others to download either, hehe...thanks again! it is appreciated!!"

,Bugenius,2008-07-17T20:12Z,"this ""mechcommander 2 (loaded)""-file has bugs and crashes often.

i prefer to download this original ""mechcommander 2.iso""

i testet it and it works perfectly, but you need a no-cd crack.


maybe you check this one too
http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3520299/MechCommander_2_ISO
but this ISO i havent tested yet, to less seeders.

,Bugenius,2008-07-17T21:45Z,"damn how i can edit this my post?

i opened wrong browser-tab and posted it here.
"
,Bugenius,2008-07-18T01:39Z,"Ok, i checked this mc2.rar (ISO) file.

It works too.
It an original mc2.iso file and you need a no-cd crack.
the mc2.rar file is better compressed as the mc2.zip.

see ya"
,MechCommander2,2008-08-11T00:19Z,"There is no problem with the files in any of the copies of mc2 posted online. A proper nocd fix was never made for the game, just fixes that circumvent the copy protection. When you mount the disc to install in Alcohol or Daemon Tools it must be mounted when you play the game as the game will pull files from the disc during play, regardless of the install type full/small. If you don't have the disc mounted the game will sporadically crash. "
,HekaApina,2008-09-14T20:07Z,"Can someone please help...
I have MagicISO ja DAEMON but I still donÂ´t know how to make this work...
I just keeps saying that I need to insert CD.

Tell me, how did YOU do it.

Thanks :)"
