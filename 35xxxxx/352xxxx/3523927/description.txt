Downloaded from armytimes.com and extracted with WinRar to (indeed) reduce file size by 10MB and Disk space required to install the game (since it has to be extracted before it's installed) as well as time.

This is OFFICIAL and working release, the ONLY difference is that .exe file is extracted for you convenience.
