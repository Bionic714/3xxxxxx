,GlobalClimax,2006-10-08T05:55Z,"I have tried googling them..  I'm still missing Season 2 episodes 14, 15, 18, 19 and 20...  All the torrents I've found for them are dead or firewalled with one seeder.  Can anyone help me out?  I'll seed a torrent with what I have of part 2 season 2 in hopes someone will fill it the blanks.

THANKS in ADVANCE!"

It's already done. Try this:

And continue seeding it. "
,obiwanbill,2006-11-20T03:26Z,"JUST SO YOU KNOW >>>

1. This is a TV Rip from Scifi Channel 
2. Broadcast in English with No Subtitles
3. All Episodes work and display with DivX and perhaps other players too.

Problems: 
4. Episodes 8 is missing the opening sequence and starts with the Title of the episode."
