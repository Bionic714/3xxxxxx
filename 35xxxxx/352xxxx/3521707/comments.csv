,autocannibal,2008-01-19T15:33Z,this is shite. not the full albums. not worth the time if your building a serious music collection.
,ellmarto,2008-03-18T22:22Z,not full albums? how many songs are missing?
,ellmarto,2008-03-19T20:39Z,"As far as i can tell this IS the full albums. 
Though there may be a difference in the American and European version. 

BUT!!!
The Jurassic 5 LP is missing! 
It was their first CD released in 1998. So this is not the complete discography. 

anyway, THANKS a lot for these 3 great albums!!
- Good Quality."
