Old Skool Games is a retro gaming Magazine that covers many classic PC and video game console systems. Typically, content does not include anything to do with newer 3D based consoles, but may include older first generation 3D games from the late 16-bit era.

The very first issue of Old Skool Games is a compilation of all reviews left over from the days when OSG was a simple web site, a repository of reviews. More recent issues of Old Skool Games usually carry a standard format of 8 game reviews and at least 1 editorial per issue. Sometimes interviews and/or reviews on specialty retro/emulation related programs are included as well.

This is a re-designed version of the original Issue #1 which is no longer available for download. This newer version represents a wider, more defined standards when it comes to color schemes and readability. There are currently 5 issues in total, 4 published and one overdue issue that is near completion.
