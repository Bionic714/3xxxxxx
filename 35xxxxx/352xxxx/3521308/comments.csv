,miman2,2006-09-10T18:07Z,"Whooa, really good stuff!! Where´s no 2, can´t wait.."
,arnold1965,2006-09-10T19:28Z,"miman2:

1 and 2 are on the same disc..

I wrote before: 

THIS IS IN 2 PARTS, SO DON'T THINK IT'S FINISHED WHEN THE FIRST PART ENDS BECAUSE THE SECOND AND FINAL PART STARTS STRAIGHT AFTER...

That means, the 2 parts are on the same disc you've just downloaded. Just keep the movie going and part 2 will begin..

Go it now?... =)"
,arnold1965,2006-09-10T20:33Z,"Save me writing eveytime I upload another movie, just go here and check what uploads I have and see if there are any new uploads..

,akitty0543,2007-12-09T06:59Z,"Just finished downloading...

I can't seem to get the movie to play. It's broken up into a bunch of varying files (IFO, BUP, VOB). Is there a program I'm supposed to open them in, because nothing's working."
,hooptie,2007-12-15T06:08Z,you need either dvd shrink or clone dvd as those are dvd files that you need to burn on a dvd
,DeclanMcRoy,2008-08-21T04:27Z,"Hi,

What program do I need to to watch this video? It won't open for me.

Thanks."
,North Nitro,2009-08-04T00:38Z,"Thanks for the nostalgic trip to the past! I totally feel like I'm in the mid-90's, downloading stuff at a ming-boggling speed of 5kB/s!"
,B.Thomas,2011-02-08T14:28Z,"Use ImgBurn and burn it out .
