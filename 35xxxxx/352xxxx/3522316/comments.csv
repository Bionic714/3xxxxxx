,duder1,2006-09-11T15:09Z,20 seeders and none have responded back that this works or not. hmmmm.
,duder1,2006-09-11T17:57Z,"AVG is picking up that update 1.4 has a trojan in it, is this true cause when I downloaded the 1.3 update from the main site it showed the same trojan.  Anyone confirm that this is a false positive?"

Dassent wårrk!

Doesen´t work, at least not for me and my supercomputer ;)"
,duder1,2006-09-11T20:14Z,"I went ahead and installed it against my judgement and everything seems OK.  The keygen works and the game runs fine for me.  

Still a little worried about AVG showing the update as a trojan though."
,Luckster,2006-09-11T20:26Z,"The updates are the genuine ones and same as the one from the creators homepage.
I just bundeled them with a working keygen.
If it shows some trojan , so does the original.

Tested with v1.3 and v1.4 , if you use the keygen to install the game in the first place it won't ask you for a key when updating.

I noticed the game crashes more often after installing the patch , especially on the NY missions.
Basicly it's just to start the mission over then."
,Yrsel,2006-09-12T11:37Z,Now it works! Don´t ask me how :D Thankyou Luckster!
