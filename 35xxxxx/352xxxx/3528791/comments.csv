[V],Sejjtan,2006-09-24T20:48Z,Whats a Dos emulator and where do i get it ?
,Cobra_Venom,2006-09-24T21:01Z,"DOSBox is a DOS Emulator.
DOS is the operating system before
Windows became popular.
Do a search and download DOSBox"
[V],Sejjtan,2006-09-24T21:18Z,IÂ´ll do that. Thanks !
[T],WinstonSmith6079,2006-09-26T23:56Z,"Excellent!  The two versions of the original Leisure Suit Larry alone is worth the d/l--but now I have the first six--er, five--of them!

Thanks!  Cobra_Venom rocks!  :)"
,Cobra_Venom,2006-09-27T09:58Z,"Thank you =)
That's right, there's only 5 Larrys in 1-6.
After they made Larry 3 they prommised never
to make a Larry 4. But Larry 3 became so popular.
So what could they do? they hade made a promise not to make Larry 4. So they released Larry 5 insted :)"
[T],WinstonSmith6079,2006-09-27T16:11Z,Not to mention that Larry doesn't do 4-play ROFL!
,Coolgamer,2006-12-27T23:29Z,"Is the first one the original or the remake?
Is the 6th one the one with voice-support or no voice?"
,gmailwhitenigger,2007-01-16T19:33Z,DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!! This is a trap by the ESA entertainment software association. I got a letter from my ISP (charter) about this download!!!

It's more likely your ISP has torrent watching software and the ESA has gotten your isp to watch for this title."
,gonnabeahustla,2007-04-19T02:49Z,will this work on scummvm??
,ChargingKaboom1,2008-06-01T02:44Z,ok after i download the torrent and i try to open it my computer asks me what program i want to use to open it so i read the comments and downloaded the DOSBox thing and now i dont know what to do... little help?
,2411,2008-07-01T17:12Z,"Can i get these to work with scummvm? If i can, then how?"
,kurisuteru,2009-01-05T16:02Z,You having problems with DOSbox better learn how to use Google. How do you retards get by on the Internet without even bothering??? rant rant.
,Schor47,2009-01-29T13:14Z,"Downloaded in just a few minutes and works great! Already finished the first game and am progressing on the second. Thanks a lot, it was worth the while =D"
,iwilleatu,2009-08-29T05:27Z,"does this come with the booklets u need to play some of these games, like lsl5 for instance"
,Poppycorn,2010-02-20T10:54Z,"I can't figure out how to play these. I'm using Vista.

I tried DOSbox but I can't figure out what to do after mounting the folder."
,Poppycorn,2010-02-20T13:14Z,"OK figured it out. For those wondering, this is what I did. I've only tried this with LSL2.

Extracted the RAR file into D:\LSL2
Open DosBOX
mount d d:\lsl2
d:
sierra.exe

And the game runs!"
,bc_420,2010-05-25T07:54Z,"Use D-Fend w/ dosbox

http://sourceforge.net/projects/dfendreloaded/files/D-Fend%20Reloaded/D-Fend%20Reloaded%200.9.3/D-Fend-Reloaded-0.9.3-Setup.exe/download 

extract games to d-fend virtual 3d folder.
extras - scan folders for new games.
scan folders.

couldn't be easier!"
,Kris43,2010-08-28T05:43Z,"Actually, why there is no fourth game was because they disbanded the 4th game. It was supposed to be a multiplayer Leisure Suit Larry game. But then it became too complicated for them to make, and sierra said that it was too much over funding. So they shut it down. They also shut down the 8th game too, which was supposed to be Leisure Suit larry Lust in Space/ Explores Uranus."
,astro2,2011-05-02T17:28Z,larry 6 talkie not in here??
,desertdood,2011-08-04T18:49Z,I'm going to see if I can use dosbox with wine in linux to get LSL going/playing
,bcnobel,2011-11-01T15:15Z,"Might i add, that these games (and all other DOS games built on Scumm) are playable on any system (like Smartphones or PC) when you use ScummVM..
Just look for it on google."
,outseeker1,2012-04-24T17:07Z,"If you love Sierra adventure games, Google Leisure Suit Larry Kickstarter! They're remaking and improving LSL1 with community involvement!! :D"
,arukarudo,2012-08-31T05:21Z,"To bypass the questions in Larry 1, use alt+x or ctrl+alt+x!"
