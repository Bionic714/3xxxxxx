Which season?
NTSC or PAL DVD?"
,mads2000,2006-09-20T08:50Z,"This is the first season, PAL."
,mads2000,2006-09-20T10:08Z,"How do I get Azureus to use all my upload speed for this torrent? Now all my torrents, up and down are sharing equal. And I want this to take all..."
,goodguy9069,2006-09-20T13:02Z,"I'm not sure if there's a better way to do it, but for all torrents you're downloading, you can set manually set the max upload rate:  Highlight them all, right-click and choose Advanced, Set Up Speed, Manual, then choose 1 or zero if possible.  
For your downloaded torrents, simply highlight all, right-click and choose Stop."
,goodguy9069,2006-09-20T13:04Z,Was the source the original DVD or did you compile this DVD yourself from MPG's you downloaded?  How would you rate the quality?
,mads2000,2006-09-20T13:53Z,"Quality is Excelent, image is copy of original DVD no compresson and all menues. 
I have seen sombody telling seeders to superseed. I have stoppet moust of my downloads to get maximum upload speed. To get this torrent moving faster I will soon move it to another PC with no other torrents."
,Shiva,2006-09-20T16:33Z,"Well I dont know how you are seeding but everybody has 0,0%"
,Mazu1982,2006-09-20T22:45Z,In azureus super seeding is in options/queue/seeding or look it up from google. And thanks for the torrent
,mads2000,2006-09-21T02:26Z,"Thank you all. I have enabled superseeding and the upload speed is about 20kB. The speed was about 1kB... The reason everybody has 0,0% is because the first one has passed 1MB yet and each piece is 4MB. I hope the Superseeding will do the trick..."
,mads2000,2006-09-21T03:14Z,1st piece uploaded!!!
,Shiva,2006-09-21T17:13Z,"Thanks man, I really liked this show ;-)"
,Shiva,2006-10-04T15:33Z,Everybody is stuck on 66% ...
,mads2000,2006-10-07T13:40Z,Had a little Problem... Now I have know how to get max output on my limited ADSL line so I think it will go a little faster from now on and to the end. I'm not shure if I will share the two other DVDs in this series. What do you think?
,juliusen,2006-10-07T22:20Z,"Please continue your upload of this great serie.

You are doing great.

Thanks for uploading"
,Mazu1982,2006-10-08T22:23Z,"Yes! Please do share the two other dvd's as well, especially now that you now how to seed faster. "
,Mazu1982,2006-10-09T16:18Z,"But if you do share them, could they be straight in vob-files and not image files? Would be easier to re-encode them that way. Thanks!"
,Twilight99,2006-11-12T15:16Z,Use DAEMON Tools and DVDdecrypter to convert to VOB files. Let the uploader choose the format he likes. Great upload by the way!!!
,iggy.stooge,2007-06-23T12:34Z,How I wish somone more would seed this thing... almost got it down when the computer locket and fucked up the files so I needed to restart the whole thing :'(
