TIRED OF PPL ASKING ABOUT SUBS AND ETC- So I have indicated all the language details 3 times here for you and will not respond to any questions about subs.  THIS ONLY HAS  ENGLISH AUDIO. NO SUBS NO OTHER TEXT LANGS EITHER....
I only have a 4.7 burner so this was reduced using DVD Shrink to keep EVERYTHING IN nothing was RIPPED.

As always I keep my torrents open for 3-4 weeks and thats it so get it while you can.  Ppl around here have a huge problem not seeding after they ownload and frankly that is not my problem, get it while I am still on-line with it.
