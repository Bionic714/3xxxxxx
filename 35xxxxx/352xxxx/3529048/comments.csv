,chossein,2006-09-30T08:02Z,Ok this is strange the seeders/leechers here is way off I have/had over 35 leechers and 5 seeders showing up in my sharing program?
,chossein,2006-10-02T14:57Z,Ok why does this board show 16 seeders and 10 leechers?  Why would it over state the amount of seeders to leechers?  Any reason behind that?  On my torrent program I am showing a different story altogether.Seed= 19 Leechers = 62. strange
