This has to be one of the most disturbing and hilarious pieces of
music that I have ever heard.

I discovered Pirinen & Str√∑mberg one late night at Underjorden,
Gothenburg, Sweden. With 100 swedish kronors that arguably could
have been spent in a more decadent and mind-numbing way, I felt
that I had to do the world a favor.

I bought this record simply to make it available online (and
laugh myself breathless together with friends).

Enjoy. SFV included for your perfectionist needs.
