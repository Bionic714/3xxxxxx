Old Skool Games is a retro gaming Magazine that covers many classic PC and video game console systems. Typically, content does not include anything to do with newer 3D based consoles, but may include older first generation 3D games from the late 16-bit era.

Issue #3 was the first "theme" issue produced by Old Skool Games. Being that we were close to independance day, the country was turning 229, and we had troops in other countries that I felt were often unappreciated for what they do, I decided to make an issue dedicated to them, full of nothing but military game reviews. Although at the time, I had designed the red white and blue cover graphics specifically for use with the July issue and Platoon screenshot, I later decided that I would make the scheme standard and adopt them as official OSG colors. It wasn't so much red blooded patriotism as it was a case of those colors working out great with my cover graphics. -(Zachary Bartels)

There are currently 5 issues in total, 4 published and one overdue issue that is near completion.
