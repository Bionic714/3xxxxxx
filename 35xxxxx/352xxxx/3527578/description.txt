|  Post-hardcore/alternative rock outfit A Static Lullaby came together      |
|  after a casual high school jam session led its members to quit their      |
|  existing bands and come together as one. Formed in 2001 in Orange         |
|  County, CA, the group began with singer Joe Brown, bassist Phil Pirrone,  |
|  drummer Brett Dinovo, and guitarists Dan Arnold and Nathan Lindeman.      |
|  Their first show was a mere two weeks after forming, and it started a     |
|  buzz about the guys that they continued to build upon throughout the      |
|  local circuit. They soon recorded and self-released the Withered EP, and  |
|  in the summer of 2002 were signed to Ferret Records.                      |
|                                                                            |
|  After recording with Steve Evetts (Snapcase, Hatebreed) in the            |
|  producer's chair, A Static Lullaby released ...And Don't Forget to        |
|  Breathe in March 2003. The album laid the foundation for the band's       |
|  music, yet hinted at a creativity not yet completely tapped. Over a year  |
|  of straight touring followed, which led to strained relations within the  |
|  band, eventually causing Dinovo to quit and return to school. A Static    |
|  Lullaby soon signed to Columbia and began work on their follow-up album.  |
|  Faso Latido appeared in April 2005 with Lou Giordano (Sunny Day Real      |
|  Estate, Taking Back Sunday) producing and friend Sammy Siegler (Youth of  |
|  Today, Gorilla Biscuits) filling in on drums.                             |
|                                                                            |
|  With the album complete and the search about to begin for a permanent     |
|  drummer, Dinovo approached his old bandmates at a show and wound up       |
|  rejoining the group in mid-2005. That same year also found A Static       |
|  Lullaby with a spot on the popular Taste of Chaos tour alongside the      |
|  Used and Killswitch Engage. January 2006 left the band in an uncertain    |
|  state after the departure of Pirrone, Dinovo, and Lindeman over musical   |
|  differences and the band's own exit from Columbia. But they were soon     |
|  embraced by California indie Fearless Records, and by March, Brown and    |
|  Arnold were again part of a full band with the addition of guitarist      |
|  John Death, bassist Dane Poppin, and drummer Jarrod Alexander to A        |
|  Static Lullaby's lineup. Working again with producer Evetts, the          |
|  refreshed quintet issued their self-titled album on Fearless that         |
|  October and headed out on tour alongside I Am Ghost.                      |
|                                                                            |
