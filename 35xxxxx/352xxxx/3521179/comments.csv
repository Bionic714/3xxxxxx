,EvilLlama,2008-08-23T19:14Z,"Of course I question the language used for the DVD itself. 
My disk is chipped, and I would like a dvd that is English. The other one I just DL-ed is written in German. Obwohl ich lesen kann, ich w체rde lieber Englisch und Datentr채ger wie die ich derzeit eigene. 
(Though I can read it, I would rather it was in English. Like the ones I currently own.)"
