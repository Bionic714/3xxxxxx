\ Twinsun is a relatively new planet on the outskirts of a remote galaxy. Its     \
\ rotational plane has stabilized between two suns. There is a huge mountain      \
\ range running along its equator, that divides the planet in half: each          \
\ hemisphere is warmed by a single sun. The Northern hemisphere, with its orange  \
\ sky, is warmer than the Southern hemisphere. Except for a polar region, the     \
\ planet's climate is clement. The formation of life forms on the planet was      \
\ thus favourable. Four species developed over the course the centuries: the      \
\ Spheros, the Rabbibunnies, the Quetches and the Grobos. They all lived in       \
\ harmony until a tyrant named Dr Funfrock reared his ugly head.                  \
\ Ever since Funfrock's rise to power, the population has been living under a     \
\ reign of terror. FunFrock set up a police state where suspicion is              \
\ omnipresent. He is all powerful and controls the people with an iron fist.      \
\ He has at his disposal two high-tech weapons that ensure his power: cloning     \
\ and teleportation. FunFrock can clone any of the species at will, and           \
\ subsequently recruit these clones into his ranks. He can then deploy these      \
\ clones instantly through a network of telepods that are dispersed over the      \
\ entire planet.                                                                  \
\                                                                                 \
\ A few years ago, under the guise of protecting the population, Dr. FunFrock     \
\ herded the planet's habitants* into the southern hemisphere. The repression     \
\ is harsh. Every day brings more and more arrests, and the people slowly begin   \
\ to lose hope. In an effort to keep their spirits up, the people sometimes       \
\ evoke an ancient legend along with the name of a goddess, Sendell. The          \
\ mentioning of the legend or Sendell has since been forbidden by Dr. FunFrock.   \
\                                                                                 \
\ Meanwhile, a young quetch named Twinsen has been having strange dreams.         \
\                                                                                 \
