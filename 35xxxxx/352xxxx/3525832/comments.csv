,aleksve,2006-09-19T12:27Z,"Ehm, why is this an exe-file?"
,raindr0ps,2007-06-09T17:00Z,There's nothing wrong with this file.  It uses the Zinoku reader and it is in .exe format. Do google search for Zinoku. It IS the best magazine reader I've ever used. I wish I could convert a lot of my .pdfs to Zinoku but it appears the site Zinoku.com.cn has been put out of business and there's no software out there to build the Zinoku reader format.
