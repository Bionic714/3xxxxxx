,shinobiung,2006-09-25T16:14Z,John Carpenters best film
,HEzooL,2006-09-26T20:18Z,"at 12:25 the video freezes, what's up with that? did you others also have that problem? :/"
,gist74,2006-09-27T01:56Z,"This is the best sci-fi horror ever made! My favourite movie, have seen it a hundred times. It's from 1982 and the effects are amazing. Extremely good visual effects. Rob Bottin rules! And music by legend Ennio Moricone."
,gist74,2006-09-27T01:56Z,It's a shame there hasn't been made a sequel to this movie. The game was great too.
,gist74,2006-09-27T01:57Z,John Carpenter is the man!
,jonahx,2006-09-27T15:35Z,"yeah, it also freezes at 12 min here.. audio continues and if u skip a bit, video will come back.. Dunno what happened with that rip :-S

Silvia, what do u think??"
,tomahawk_dts,2006-10-16T15:09Z,"Yeah, it's corrupted @12"" (ca 1 minite is missing) and ... it's not collector's edition which has anamorphic widescreen and .... this torrent doesn't have it for sure :-("
,rephunter,2006-10-27T15:37Z,"he mate is there any chance of getting the documentary on here for download, i really want to see it if anyone has it plz upload..thanks"
,mrwijken,2007-05-07T17:45Z,"HELLO, SOMBODY  PLEAS  SEDDA ON THIS FILM OK."
,resonator,2007-06-23T14:28Z,"This remake of the 50's original is the best output from John Carpenter, and also one of the most exciting films ever. Great synthesizer soundtrack from the director himself."
,resonator,2007-06-23T14:42Z,"Sorry, film score is of course by Ennio Morricone, and not as usual by John Carpenter."
,gameking19,2007-07-10T00:02Z,how do i burn it over to a dvd?
,symph,2007-07-30T22:26Z,"Why is .avi 2 and .avi 4 dubbed? really annoying, but everything else is good:) Cant access the language selection either."
,methyd-9,2008-08-05T20:59Z,Great movie! Thanks!
,noxiousfix,2008-09-03T08:36Z,"thanks silvia-, been looking everywhere for this movie... and found it a few times but no seeders! finally!! great movie and PLEASE KEEP SEEDING!!!"
,Titlover33,2009-02-19T14:40Z,"I can't fucking play the documentary, ?????????????

Is it not on the DVD or is it bugged? CANT SELECT IT!!! SOMEONE REPLY PLZ"
,Titlover33,2009-02-19T14:41Z,The docu was the only reason i downloaded this...
,Nosferatu666,2010-05-21T22:05Z,"Yes, there is an error at 12:25 and it's caused by a minor corruption in the file VTS_01_1.VOB
This is the collector's edition, but the anamorphic widescreen must have been stripped out too save space.
The special features are present. Nice torrent."
,gravi_fan89,2010-10-09T04:43Z,"Oh, by the Kami, why is this file so huge  I think 4 gigs is a bit much for a movie file.  Any reason why it's so huge?"
,kviende,2011-10-30T15:57Z,tack
