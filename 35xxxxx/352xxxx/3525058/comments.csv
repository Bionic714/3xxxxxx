,Patch10,2006-09-19T00:13Z,Great Download! Thanks a million! 
,dallasgill420,2006-09-19T04:03Z,Where do I get an Intsallation code to activate the program?
,Billshiony,2006-09-24T18:37Z,I keep getting a warning that I have an Invalid serial number and I can't activate it.  What am I doing wrong?
,styret,2006-09-25T17:05Z,Thanks
,Puttethebad,2006-10-04T12:37Z,Could you (or anyone who has it) please do a torrent with only the keygen for Corel apps?
,yuwadee,2006-10-15T12:34Z,"Please give me activation code

Thnks ;-)"
,dude0101a,2006-10-17T18:54Z,"From ssg.nfo: Unzip, unrar. Disable the network before installation
           and don't enable it back before you'll activate the
           program. Run our keygen and install using the serial
           number from keygen (you can either use ""Already have
           trial serial"" field or press ""Phone Corel"" button and
           enter serial there). DON'T GENERATE NEW SERIAL AND
           DON'T CLOSE KEYGEN UNTIL FINISHING ACTIVATION OR YOU'LL
           HAVE TO REINSTALL APPLICATION ONCE MORE. After the
           first run you will be asked to activate application.
           Use offline activation by phone, copy installation ID
           (w/o dashes!) to the keygen (at this point you must
           have same serial in application and in keygen, that's
           why you should not generate a new one or close keygen)
           and generate activation code. Paste activation code to
           application and activate the program. "
,gatans_styvbarn,2006-10-28T15:09Z,"apperantly the nfo seems to be very important here, but when i try to open it i ceep geting information about it being damaged..any salutions to that?"
,CaptSpaulding,2006-10-31T16:14Z,"You have to add dashes to the Activation code the keygen gives you every 4th character.

Example

Keygen code

After editing
8286-A7B8-DDE6-5924-C379

Hope it helps"
,Kyllah,2006-11-06T17:18Z,"Thanks, it works perfect."
,10-ekips,2006-12-10T17:30Z,Corel seems to be countering this arrangement.  They just disabled my installation! :-(
,Maquisard,2006-12-12T01:53Z,"I had completed the installation successfully (as instructed), and was able to run the program several times without a problem. Then I did one of two things which might've messed it up, to the point where the program doesn't respond to attempts to launch it any more. It's either deleting the material I dowloaded from BT (the packed program) as well as the unpacked setup files (but not the program itself), or visiting Corel's website. What would you recommend for after I download this again (and believe me, I'll keep it on my HD this time)?"
,10-ekips,2006-12-12T21:58Z,The program 'phones home' to mommy and Corel disables illegitimate keys.  You need to black access with your firewall to prevent this.  They did it twice on me before I caught on!
,10-ekips,2006-12-22T05:26Z,"It evidently checks for updates even though you tell it NOT to. As soon as you load it up, there is disk activity LONGER than usual, then it becomes unregistered and prompts for the confirmation process again. If you block its internet access, it slows down the machine something awful for about 10 minutes! The program window flickers considerably during this period as well. I tried it on two different machines."
,mayner,2007-01-05T00:43Z,"sweet little gigt..my prob is I keep getting microsoft visual c+++ runtime error corel.exe

any suggestion...thks"
,car54,2007-01-17T20:50Z,"Thanks big boy this is a Fuckin'A prog.

One thing though. If like me you have followed the instructions to the letter and you still cannot get it to work after you have entered the activation code!!!
Don't panic. Just add an extra letter/number to the beginning on the activation sequence. Hit continue--get !Wrong Code shit"" go back and remove the extra number/letter you placed in there and hit continue again and Hot Diggity your up an runnin like a hound on mountain dew!!

Highstate my wife will carry your love child any day...."
,10-ekips,2007-01-22T14:13Z,"This new version of PSP installs a process (PSIService.exe) which RE-VALIDATES the installation each time it is run.  This is how Corel can determine if the installation is legitimate and disble those that are not.  The information I have is this (from C-Net):

PSIService.exe 
by patrick150 - 1/17/07 11:24 AM
In reply to: PSIService.exe by Fish 
I received the following information from Protexis, who owns this program, which is used to verify that there is a legitimate software license. I am running the latest Corel Paint Shop Pro.


======================================================
Thanks for contacting Protexis Support,

You're correct; Protexis provides licensing services for Corel. A license check is performed each time you start your Corel product to verify a valid license is present on your machine. 

Please let me know if you have any further questions.

Best regards,

,Highstate,2007-04-03T00:40Z,I've found just let the application run. My copy has not be deactivated and still works perfectly. I have also updated the applicaton with no problems.
,budlazz,2007-06-25T11:49Z,"Thank you highstate works good for me, I followed the instructions.  It is important to disconnect network and leave out the dashes.  dude0101a thank you for the updated detail.  It works and I have updated and it is ok... I uninstalled snapfire... didn't like it too much but thanks for the PSP...  I will seed for a couple of hours....

,RegardingGrapes,2008-01-19T05:53Z,"I think that the company is wise to the ""keygen"", because whilst I run the newly installed program with the keygen still open, as per the nfo, the program would just not run; I then closed the keygen to test if that was the problem, which led me to the activation screen.  Of course since I closed the keygen the serial number I had generated did not work with the new activation code.  Does anyone have any suggestions, am I doing it wrong or was I just too late?"
,lilmamaj81,2008-01-19T23:58Z,Has anyone figured out where to get the installation code?
,neoshaded,2008-02-13T00:46Z,"1. Disable Network / Internet Connection
   Do this first, so you don't forget, otherwise it'll activate, and shut you down, and you'll NEVER be able to  reinstall on this computer


2. unzip the package


3. Open this Text file (good job) and read all the way through


4. Open Keygen and Generate a SerialNumber 
DONT GENERATE AGAIN OR CLOSE UNTIL ACTIVATION IS COMPLETE

5. Install Setup Package. Click on ""Phone Corel"" and use the keygen to get a serial number.

6. Continue with installation, Don't install Yahoo toolbar, that's Adware.

7. Launch Corel Paint Shop Pro Photo XI and quit the application. (DO NOT go to Help->Buy Now...)


8. It will give you -Buy Now- page. Click on ""Have Key"" or whatever in the lower left to open Activation Dialogue

9. In the field where it asks for the Key, copy the serial number that you used to install fron the Keygen.   Click on -Phone Corel-


(Keygen MUST still be open with same serial number) 

10. Now you will see an Installation Code (created by entering your serial/key previously)
    Copy that WITHOUT ANY DASHES into the keygen, and click Activate.

11. Now copy your activation code into the box on Paint Shop Pro, and Viola, DONE!


12. When you open Corel Next time, your firewall may pop-up a notification to allow the program access,  Deny it! It's trying to double-check your activation!
