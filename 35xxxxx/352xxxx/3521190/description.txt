Kidnap girl to give TV interview

Austrian teenager Natascha Kampusch, who was held captive for eight years, is expected to reveal her ordeal in a television interview this week.

The 18-year-old will be interviewed by state broadcaster ORF on Wedneday.

It will be her broadcast media interview since she escaped from her underground cell two weeks ago.

Two publications also claim the teenager has agreed to speak to them.

Ms Kampusch agreed to the television interview out of "an express desire to personally inform the public", Mr Ecker said.

He said the interview would focus on her "health, ability to reason, her future prospects, her social situation and... her life after the media hype".

She would be "shielded" during the broadcast to make sure people could not recognise her, he added.

'No fee'

Ms Kampusch is also said to have agreed to give interviews to the mass-circulation daily Kronen Zeitung and weekly magazine News.

There have reportedly been hundreds of requests for an interview with the teenager, with media outlets offering vast sums of money.

But ORF is reportedly not paying for its interview.

The teenager escaped the house she had been held in since the age of 10 on 23 August.

Her captor, Wolfgang Priklopil, 44, killed himself after her escape.
