,majtymicke,2006-09-14T20:28Z,Hm....this is all tracks on one file. That isnt very fun. 
,dahulk12,2006-09-15T14:56Z,"The MP3s are individual, just WRAPPED together to be sent as one file. Use albumwrap extractor to UNwrap the MP3s after you download file. Once you UNwrap the file (only takes a few SECONDS!), then the MP3s will once again be seperated. I don't mean to sound like a grouch, but READ THE POST! Everything is explained. MP3 = 320 kbps and WRAPPED WITH ALBUMWRAP.  I even gave you the site where you can get the extractor for free! Please, people. This isn't rocket science. I made everything quick and simple for you so you can quickly start enjoying the music.  I'm sharing and helping from the heart.  Don't come across as disrespectful and unappreciative. People will want to STOP sharing! That would be very sad. We all have found things we've been looking for somewhere on the  Internet at one time or another."
