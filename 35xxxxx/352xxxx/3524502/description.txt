Stainless Night
After ten years of dormancy, Linea awakens from a capsule in the countryside of Japan. Without any memories, she wanders into a small research center staffed by three beautiful women. Sayako, one of the researchers, is entranced by the strange woman and falls in love. Leaving Misuzu, her present lover, Sayako takes the stranger to bed, and finds that her abilities are beyond that of any ordinary woman! However, a second capsule opened shortly after Linea\'s, and soon all four of the women will be in terrible danger.
