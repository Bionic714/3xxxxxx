,arnold1965,2006-09-08T01:13Z,"Looks like piratebays stats are all up the fuck again.. By what I see as it is with seeders and leechers, sure doesn't match with what I see through utorrent..

Nothing ever matches with this site..

,arnold1965,2006-09-08T10:55Z,"I've uploaded another movie..

Please keep seeding these films..
I only seed until there are enough seeders to continue, then I stop, then I upload another movie..
I think it's fair..

,Vice.,2006-09-20T17:12Z,Hej! Skulle den/de som har denna filmen vilja seeda en stund? Jag skulle så gärna vilja ha denna film! Tack på förhand. Victor
,mayngontoc,2006-09-29T19:14Z,Just like Dvd delivered right at your door. Thanks master.
,shinobiung,2006-10-04T21:22Z,"first 30mins is awesome, but then the stupid hollywood ideas start about trying to match goth paganism with reality. why couldnt they just leave it at a game killing for real instead of trying to put hollywood idolism in there. 

could have been so much better, but most fun film I seen since Silent Hill"
,Mouchi,2006-11-14T01:23Z,"Hi!
I'm still kind of new with this whole downloading thingy with Piratebay. I allways stick to downloading .rar movies, because I understand how I should extract them and then burn them.

But how do I extract VIDEO.BUP files?
Haven't solved it yet, so I would be greatfull for any tips or solutions :)

Have a good time! // JoJo"
