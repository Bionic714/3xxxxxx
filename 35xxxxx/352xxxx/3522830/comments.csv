,DaemonRakoth,2006-09-17T10:35Z,"This one is getting seeding, 4-5-6 are the problem ones. "
,xwoz,2006-09-17T21:25Z,"4-5-6 are not necessarily problem ones - I asked for you to please be patient - they are coming.

Any more comments like phazetds, and I WILL stop seeding. I don't see you seeding anything. 

A simple 'thank you' goes a long way. . ."
