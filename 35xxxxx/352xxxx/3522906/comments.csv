,cb951303,2006-09-12T22:20Z,"I think this is fake, there is no way that it's 180 MB
any1 tried yet?"
,Geldethi,2006-09-12T23:00Z,"Dont think it is fake as such, it is about right for dune 2000 though, like El Jafar said, most wont remember the true dune original

Original Dune on the underdogs :)"
,1029384756,2006-09-13T07:23Z,"It's the CD version, which includes some ""high-tech"" video and sound.  The basic game is still the same, as is the gameplay.

BTW my network went down yesterday, so sorry that I didn't get a chance to seed it for very long after I posted the torrent!  I'll try to keep online a bit longer this time..."
,koshman,2006-09-14T10:19Z,"I heard there is also a CD soundtrack in this version. Is it included here?
It doesnt seem to be in the version hosted by Underdogs."
,1029384756,2006-09-15T08:00Z,"koshman,

There are sounds for the game's effects, for the cutscenes in the ""book"", for transition animations -- like travel and battle, for the dialog lines, and for the menu screens as well.  In fact, you can turn off on-screen text baloons, and play the game with sound only (everything that is ""said"", is also spoken outloud.)

So yeah, it pretty much has a soundtrack (unless you meant something else by your question?)"
,koshman,2006-09-15T10:43Z,I thought there were actual audio tracks on the original CD. But I might have misinterpreted an old review :-)
,hcinfo,2007-01-15T18:08Z,More Seeds PPl. Plz..... All should upload twice the ratio. This game is a classic and is awsome.

,everfrag,2009-09-18T05:04Z,"So this is the original dune by virgin games? I've got a version and its 1.82mb 2.12on disk, has sound but doesn't talk, runs without dosbox. I'm gonna get this out of curiosity."
,juxta99,2010-10-12T13:52Z,"One of the best games ever made, they should really remake it monkey island 2 style. Thanks heaps"

,eddybennet,2012-06-09T16:48Z,"There is a soundtrack album for the game - it's by Exxos and is called Dune Spice Opera.  It's a fantastic album, and there's currently a FLAC rip of it on TPB."
