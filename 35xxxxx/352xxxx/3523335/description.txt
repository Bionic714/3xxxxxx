Davey Graham is a legend from the 60's who's still delivering great performances of acoustic guitar virtuosity today.  Back in the 60's, he was a leader in his field and a true innovator.
Mostly studio tracks, some with a bass and drumkit jazzy backing, but there are also a couple of solo live performances.
