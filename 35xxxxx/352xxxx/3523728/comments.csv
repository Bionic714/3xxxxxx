,bonkeman,2006-12-11T22:24Z,"Shut up about the torrent not working!!! It's fine! 

But WHY spend time making a collection of Queen and use 128 kbps mp3's??? It's FUCKING STUPID and the sound quality is CRAP because if that...."
,icab,2006-12-15T14:17Z,"Great collection.  I didn't download all the albums, but the ones I did don't have track numbers, so albums are not sorted according to the real ones."
,icab,2006-12-15T14:26Z,"Ouch.  Now that I've listened to more songs, I wish I hadn't wasted my time with this.  There are so many songs with radio-like quality."

,Bazzez,2006-12-28T15:13Z,Someone seed please ?! 
,goete,2006-12-31T15:03Z,"why 128Kbps CBR???
I can see that you want to keep the bitrate down because of the entire size, but why, why , why CBR?

please use the VBR option in lame or even better use ""oggenc -q4""
CBR is only good for one thing; streaming..."
