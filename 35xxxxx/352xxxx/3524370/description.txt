If you have downloaded this package, you obiously know what WOXY is and the fact that it doesn't exist anymore.  As a tribute, I have posted the original signoff of the terrestial station 97x (FM97.7) located in Oxford, Ohio.  I grew up listening to this station and am very sad to see its pheonix, woxy.com, fade away as well.  These recordings are the last 5.5 hours of the Terrestial existance recorded directly from airwaves in Oxford, and not recorded from the Internet.  They have the real radio sound feel to it and I am sorry to say I never got used to listening to WOXY in pure digital (even though I enjoyed it).  I hope you treasure these as much as I do.
