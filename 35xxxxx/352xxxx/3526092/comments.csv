,stackerlee,2006-09-18T22:01Z,Someone tried to share the DVD version of this one a while ago. You don't happen to have it? 
,steven001,2006-09-18T22:19Z,"Yes, I have the dvd. Not the original dvd but one I burned to dvd-r. It's easier and faster uploading a .avi version due to the smaller file size.
If you don't want to pay $40 for the dvd you can just rent it and burn it to dvd-r it like I did for only $10 http://technicalvideorental.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&products_id=1228"
