"Life As We Know It" is about high school life in a Seattle community, shown through the eyes of three different--yet similar--hormonal, sex-constantly-on-the-mind teen boys. Dino is the jock with secret sensitivity; Jonathan is the artist who sees life through a camera lens; and Ben is the 'A' student who will never make his parents happy. The three are fast friends, and always talk (and think) about their favorite subject: girls and sex with girls.

The television series is based on British author Melvin Burgess' controversial novel "Doing It".

Produced by: Sachs/Judah, Cabloom!, and Touchstone Television
