These are the server files for RF Online Giga 3.


INCLUDES:

In-depth guides and trouble-shooting help for those who aren't sure what to do and also includes download links.

Programs needed such as a Hex Editor and Wamp Web Server.

The clients RF.exe to connect to a local server, plus rfx-g3patch.exe.


Wamp's www root files that the launcher connects to, which also includes GM codes PLUS codes to spawn monsters/items/armor/talics and other unique items you won't find  in the game without a GM tag.

You may need some MSSQL Enterprise Manager experience, but little is needed, as there are help files inside.

Enjoy.

( I take no credit for the creation of the server files, however I do take credit for the mounds of help files, thanks :) )
