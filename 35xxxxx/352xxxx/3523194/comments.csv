thanks"
,Derc,2006-09-20T18:21Z,"mrcobra if you'd read the comments youll find a link to follow... there is info on what the game is about rankings...stats and user comments. 
anyhoo here is the link again.
http://www.gamespot.com/search.html?type=11&stype=all&qs=Shadow+Man&x=36&y=10 
To clarify myself... about what I didnt like about the game.. I felt like it was a very boring and bland game with less than standard graphics, and below average gameplay. To me, the game has no replayability... therefore hence, no shadowman 2. But you judge for yourself. I bought this game originally for PSX, for $.99 at a factory closeout store here in the U.S. called surplus city. I thought WOW!! WHATA BARGAIN! Until I played the friggin thing. Anyway get it, play it, and judge for yourself. I have played alot of bad games... in fact I have nearly 3000 games total. However shadowman is not among them. 
Over and Out."
,mrcobra,2006-09-21T20:01Z,"thanks Derc! trust your ""your the game is good feeling"" (?) ...  are going to try and find a game with great rewievs from all downloders..  have a nice day!

,justletmeregisteralready,2008-06-07T20:38Z,"Thanks for uploading this game, i've been looking for it for a while - ever since i came upon a list from a guy with 10 games he liked most. Nine of them i've loved my self and there was this one i've never hear of...i have great expactation for this game.

Amazon has 4 and a half stars rating for this game, which is promising. Gamespot user coments that are 9+ are very convincing, and it seems that anyone who loves a good story in a game will love it. The poor marks it seem come from the horde of juvelie kids so i wouldn't worry about it to much.

Again, thanks for the upload."
,riplikethat,2008-12-26T02:20Z,Thanks for this game (have been looking for it since 1999).
,riplikethat,2008-12-26T02:21Z,"FYI, Gamespot UK gave it 8/10.

I don't give a shit about these reviewers but posted just cause of the first poster.
