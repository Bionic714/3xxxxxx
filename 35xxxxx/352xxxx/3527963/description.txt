Against this chaos, Wall Street big shot TOM HANSEN, is shocked to learn of the death of his best friend RICHARD KESTER, a top executive for one of the nation?s leading oil companies - Condor. But when he?s approached by Richard?s boss, JARED TOLSEN, to advise on a big oil merger his friend was working on, he jumps at the chance to kickstart his faltering career.

At the same time idealistic business school graduate ABBEY GALLAGHER is convinced by Tom to join his prestigious investment bank to work on a deal that promotes alternative energy use. Tom finds himself unexpectedly drawn to Abbey?s energy and enthusiasm, qualities long since lost in him. Sexual tension builds and they embark on a risky love affair.

Tom starts researching the Condor deal. The merger target is Black Star, a Russian oil company. Tom soon discovers that things are not as they should be. Black Star?s oil regions are dry yet they still manage to deliver scarce oil to the US. Digging deeper, Tom begins to uncover a global conspiracy of illegal oil trafficking, governmental cover-ups and murder.

Tom receives threats. He?s forced to distance himself from Abbey to protect her. Believing he may be involved in something illegal, Abbey begins her own investigation leading to her kidnap by the Russian mafia when she too learns too much. With the clock ticking, Tom has to put his career, his reputation and even his life in jeopardy to protect Abbey and expose the truth about the deal.
