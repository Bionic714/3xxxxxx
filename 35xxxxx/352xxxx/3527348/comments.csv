I am using Vista. 

I download and installed License manager first.

From Keygen, I get the license file. which I put in flexlm.

and then installed the products.

For installation purposes I had to reboot the computer. 

Continued the installation but gave errors, bunch of error back to back saying could not make shortcuts for the programs in the start menu. 

pressed OK to all of them.

Mentor graphics folder in the start menu was empty.

It didnt work for me. 

Anyone Please please tell me, what is the right way to install this.

thanks"

As I understand some Licensing server has to be setup and lic.txt should be showed while installing, the keygen after giving hostid isnt doing anything, nothing, no confirmation!! does it works??

their is no flexLm?? flexid and flexcleaup installer are there. am just not getting it please guide."
,nueron,2009-02-04T14:43Z,"Program installed, please dont mount this and install, instead extract it on C:\ 

the keygen works creating license.dat in the folder where it resides, apply when its been asked during the installation procedure, twice will be called for, if asked for installing dongle drivers click yes. choose a separate drive other than where the program is installed when it asks where to save the projects.

no hassles, pretty simple.
