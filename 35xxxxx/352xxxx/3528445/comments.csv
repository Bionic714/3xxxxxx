,jgabriel,2006-09-24T01:58Z,"Two questions:

A) Panpa, how long is this? There are versions of varying length depending on the international market segment -- the Russian version at 275 minutes appears to be the complete version.

B) English subs anywhere?

,cameronG,2006-09-27T13:48Z,"I'm getting this message when I'm trying to burn - ""VTS_02_0.IFO contain bogus data and can't be repaired"". Anyone else having trouble burning this?"

What about his brother Michalkov, does anyone have his 1970 movies, like Oblomov or Selfplaying piano?"
,candance,2006-10-03T14:58Z,"@ cameronG . Dont worry, ignore error messages. Dvd works fine on my standalone player. I used Intervideodvd for burning, but I believe the Nero works fine too. I think it gives error message because warnings are stripped and not very well rebuilded. Anyway it works and thats important.
Thank YOU panpa, great upload !!!"
,cameronG,2006-10-05T18:33Z,Ok. thanks candance. And Panpa for the upload.

,cvvvcvvv,2011-10-12T19:13Z,DULL MOVIE.
,heimsmyndin,2012-09-01T15:31Z,"I don't think this is the full Russian version. I had problems with the subs, so I downloaded the movie from a Russian torrent page. I haven't compared all of it, but there are some scenes this version lacks in the beginning at least.
I haven't found subs for it though. :(
Anyways, I can upload the torrent I used if anyone's interested."
