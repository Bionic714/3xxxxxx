,skif dank,2010-01-05T03:06Z,"It's Wolf-3d, not the original one. As for the emulator question, DONT! emulators and virtualPCs are for fags. How hard is it to setup a 1gig 6.22/3.11 partition? Quit being lazy and do shit right. "

How? easy!

Some cool guys made it possible to play the real games, from back then, like this one (WOLFENSTEIN 3D) by theyre creation of DOSBOX, it's an MSDOS Emulator, which everybody can use FREELY.

Do not PAY for DOSBOX, it is freeware!
