Isabelle is auditioning for the Huskeroo ads afterall. Once Celia sees that Isabelle has an opportunity to go national she may change her mind about Isabelle's involvement. Celia is still campaigning and is starting to wonder what Nancy does during all of her ""free time"" as a widowed housewife. Conrad lays out the details of the operations of their Armenian neighbors and Nancy comes up with a plan. Silas may have more to deal with than a baby on the way. Shane finally starts to fit in at school. Heylia prepares for her first date with Joseph.
