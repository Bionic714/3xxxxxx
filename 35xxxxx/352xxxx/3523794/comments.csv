,duppsko,2006-09-15T11:37Z,a very nice techno tune playing in the background. Anyone know the name of it?
,gregersamsa,2006-09-16T21:42Z,"Funny you should ask, I just looked this torrent up to write what music it was just because I knew someone out there would like it.

It's a song called Cygnus X, on the album FACT by Carl Cox, an English DJ who's sometimes really, really brilliant. Just not so good at spreading his magic sounds. He is an artist well worth looking into. I highly recommend his other works.

Note: He did NOT condone Nikki using his music for porn! He's a family man and does not want to be associated with teen porn."
