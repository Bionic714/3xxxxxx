Description: Clearly influenced by russian traditional fairy tales and the surrealist avant-garde, Medvedkine made this funny and caustic tale of the adventures of a Russian peasant. This surprising rarity leaves one at wonder at how it escaped in the early thirties the barrage of stalinist political and cultural reaction that effectively destroyed the avant-garde in the Soviet Union. Eisenstein upon seeing this film was quoted to have said: 'Today I saw how a Bolshevik laughs.'
