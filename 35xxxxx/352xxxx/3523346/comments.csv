,caram,2006-09-13T05:06Z,I don't understand you guys....Why do you download stuff that you have no idea what it's about. It has a code and it's not for you....
,wwefan,2006-09-13T07:29Z,"Its actually Greek but the letters don't show up as Greek letters but like our letters.  Change the font to ""Symbols"" and you'll see.  I don't speak Greek but I'm very familiar with it."

,caram,2006-09-13T18:11Z,"TO caram bgainei apo    carampoutsaras...ase mas re file. If you wanna know, thepiratebay is a public tracker where people can upload anything they want in order to share it with the people they want. If you want you can break the code in order to see what we are sharing and satisfy your curiosity. You wonÂ´t be very impressed, I am warning you. 

I am sure that there are at  least 1000000 other things that you would love to download and they are all without a password. So go ahead and stop wasting your time."
