,comandanteloof,2007-12-05T19:36Z,you guys rockkk! i've been looking for this everywhere!
,baelin,2007-12-06T20:45Z,"This is A true gem of a collection I watched and laughed at these as a kid ( as well as an adult )
now I can pass these on to my son as well. I will seed this as I do all files for two weeks then reseed for another two. So to be sure everyone has a chance to enjoy. PLEASE SEED!!!"
,Joker1974,2008-06-18T03:51Z,"Any comment on the actual quality?  There's some Tex Avery bootleg DVDs on ebay and sell.com, but they have badly-made menus and the picture quality is very poor... like they were taken from youtube!

I hope the files used for this DVD are a higher resolution, but I guess I need some SEEDS to find out for myself!  :)

Cheers, DarkLamer!"

The menus are nice and basic only used as an easy way to navigate. These are like the ones on sell.com except you get it for free. Very good upload Thanks."
