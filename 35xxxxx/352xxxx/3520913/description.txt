If slow and steady wins the race, then Seam's Sooyoung Park has been coming in first place for years. Combining whispery vocals and a double dose of guitar in true slo-core fashion, Seam produced The Problem With Me before words like "emo" and "alternative" were even on the chopping-block. Writing "love" songs for an anti-love song generation isn't easy, but Sooyoung seems to command the perfect balance between sweet and biting, especially on favorites like "Rafael" and "Sweet Pea." The Problem With Me proves why the greatest classic albums can stand on their own without needing category.
