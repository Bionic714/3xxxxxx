,Humpie,2006-09-13T22:05Z,Can someone confirm that this does not need an authentic key to activate? I have a feeling that it does and downloading this is pointless. 
,Humpie,2006-09-14T00:24Z,"I have myself confirmed that this does need an authentic key to activate. Therefore the person seeding this is a moron, and if you see this message and you still download it, then you yourself are a moron. "
