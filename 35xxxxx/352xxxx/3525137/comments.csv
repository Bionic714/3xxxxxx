,topolab,2006-09-17T19:49Z,"btw, the guy who uploaded this torrent never seeded it! i was the first who got it and never saw anyone seeding it! wtf"
,uraphake,2006-09-18T09:29Z,"Maybe I'm not understanding what you just said, but if you were able to download this torrent, then someone had to have been seeding it.
Usually, if you don't see the seeder it means they are using ""super seeding"" mode."
,uraphake,2006-09-18T09:31Z,"Oh, and you can have a missing hash which tells your client if there is a seeder connected. A type of ""scrape"" error also. Regardless, the torrent will download in spite of that."
,black curtian,2007-01-09T01:28Z,"topolab your a fuckin idiot...like the comment above.. how the fuck do you think you got the full down if there were no seeders. leechers are just that cuz they dont yet have the full down. 

you are apparently a noob so heres a little advice to keep u from getting banned from sites..when you down something seed it until you get a ratio of at least 1.0. do to many hit and runs and sites will start banning you cuz u refuse to seed."
