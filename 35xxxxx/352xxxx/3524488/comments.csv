,braskamin,2006-09-15T12:30Z,Ron Paul starts talking after about 2 minutes.
,Peaknik,2006-09-15T12:31Z,"This is seariosly interesting stuff. Ron Paul is one of the few sensible people left in the US.  The Iran oil bourse seems a fizzle though. It was supposed to open March and then end of September this year and things are just dead quiet.  Or are there things happening behind the curtains?  Currently there is a huge fleet of US naval ships in ME waters: See http://www.debka.com/article.php?aid=1208
Is the Hizbolla issue used as a reason for US to control the ME oil market?  Despite all crap going on Dollars and sharemarket is propped up and gold/silver price is pressed down to make all look OK."
,braskamin,2006-09-15T13:29Z,"You're right about the Iran oil bourse - it seems to be some kind of hide-and-seek game where Russia also plays on a fiddle. Russia has passed Saudi Arabia as world  number 1 in oil production. Putin is also talking about opening ruble-denominated oil and natural gas stock exchange ( http://en.rian.ru/russia/20060510/47915635.html ).

Actually, you could also see US war in Afghanistan as a Dollar Hegemony perspective. The Taliban's had erased all opium fields and stopped the production - now, after the invasion,  the opium crops are bigger then ever. Opium is sold in dollar and hence prop up the demand for dollars. I don't defend the Taliban's or say it's the only reason but I do think it's one of the major reasons for that war."

,DeepPirate,2006-09-15T13:54Z,Ron Paul is probably the most principled member of congress; which is why you rarely see him featured in the main stream media.

to those of you interested, you will find at the link above a major university paper on the real reason for the iraq war and it is exactly what is stated in the above video.  the paper however, being 24 pages long has quite a bit more detail in it.  enjoy.l"

Agree, would add Cynthia McKinney as well. To good people from ""both sides""."
