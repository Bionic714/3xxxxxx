,LV-VGW,2006-09-18T23:37Z,"Hi! I've downloaded the Flight1ATR-2-1.exe file from Flight1 website on 09/16/2006 and I canÂ´t crack it withe the bypasser. IÂ´ve tried with all the possibilities (-u -r and -nothing), with my internet cable disconnected and nothing happens!. I got my crash Windows XP error msg just when the wrapper  start after pressing the OK button. Hope you can understand my grammar and thanks for your help!.

"
,LV-VGW,2006-09-20T00:12Z,Thanks for your quick response David. I did what you told me and none of that de-wrappers work either. I'll wait till a new de-wrapper come. 
,David-7237,2006-09-24T08:47Z,"with de-Flight1.exe
try 1st with -r or -u
like this:
de-Flight1.exe F1_ATR.exe -u

I cracked my ATR using one of those loaders and I have heard that de-Flight1.exe cracks that ATR

make sure you follow the correct steps"
