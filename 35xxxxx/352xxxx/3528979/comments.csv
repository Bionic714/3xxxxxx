,Mr_Fear,2006-09-26T09:10Z,I'll take a look at my copies when i get home from work.
,icleolion,2006-09-26T11:17Z,"Mr_Fear, its going to be a real struggle to keep up if TOS, TNG and DS9 are being uploaded at the same time.  So if u have DS9 could i ask that you wait till you have finished uploading TOS?

Thanks"
,Mr_Fear,2006-09-26T13:41Z,"Sure i'll wait, will be having trouble keeping up the speeds anyway.

But as i wrote, i'm going to check if i have DS9 with all subs first, before getting into any uploading of these dvd's."
[V],firbie,2006-09-26T19:32Z,"Of course I can wait, if I have to some months. I want some Tos too. I was just curious because season one is the only one I mis. "
