,Lance_Lake,2006-09-22T16:52Z,The only seeder is sending below 512k packets.
,tlarseth,2006-09-23T11:15Z,"I am uploading at around 50kbps which is the highest I can while still hosting teamspeak and a Neverwinter Nights Persistant World on my computer, without too much lag."
,tlarseth,2006-09-23T11:15Z,But will try to up it a bit until more people seed this.
,Lance_Lake,2006-09-25T17:13Z,"Appricate the help. There's only one seeder however currently and they don't seem to be uploading at all.

Can more people please seed this?"
,tlarseth,2006-09-25T22:17Z,"There are a lot of people connected to me, I can upload at a max of 100kbps, and there is about 50 people seeding making it so that the upload per person will be 2-5kbps.

At least there are a lot of people at 98% on this right now."

,tlarseth,2006-09-28T07:18Z,"Okay, out of 60 people who downloaded this, I am still the only seeder.  I am only going to seed this til this weekend it is Wednesday now, Sunday I am going to stop seeding this until more people request this file."

,daysy_doggen,2006-11-03T13:08Z,plz seed
,tlarseth,2006-11-14T06:07Z,"The computer that had this on it's Hard Drive was stolen from my house, and I am unable to provide seeding for this.  Hopefully others have downloaded it 100% so that I can possibly download this and seed it again."
,tlarseth,2007-01-23T18:16Z,"There are people seeding this.  Last time I checked there was 12 seeders uploading at approx. 127Kbps.  And, that was just yesterday."
,tlarseth,2008-11-17T06:33Z,"okay, I am going to start reseeding this as several people have messaged me wanting more seeder."
