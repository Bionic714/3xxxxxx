If you want a good 717, you wanna have the Vans 717.
Thanks for the upload though ;-)"

,victoreadward,2006-10-05T15:13Z,"hi all

I'd like to make a request for all. Could someone yield me a copy of FS2000? Download from any web site is not a good idea here in Brazil because is very very slow our internet takes 42h or more. Then I can think only in your help.

It's just my training at home. I am in love for planes and that happened in my country last week brought up this love.

Contact me at victoreadward@msn.com

Waiting for your contact.

Best

Vitor Eduardo"
