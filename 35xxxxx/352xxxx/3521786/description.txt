This is a reencode of the keynote by everyones favorite lawyer, Lawrence Lessig found here:

I figured 8GB of data was a bit much for most people so I created an Ogg Theora/Vorbis version. Ogg Theora is a completely free format, it will play out of the box on any modern Linux distro, if you use Windows you need to install the following:

to get support for the needed directfilters, this will add support to applications such as Windows Media Player.

I hope you enjoy the keynote as much as I did, in which case I high recommend picking up a copy of Lessigs latest book Free Culture, it is of course like this video under a Creative Commons license.
