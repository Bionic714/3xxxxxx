This is a fairly basic analogue-style synth with similar sound capabilities to the Wasp (included with FL Studio). It has a nice black and yellow interface and doesn't use much CPU. The presets are OK, but you've probably already got lots of buzzy basses with other VSTis. Worth checking out if you're new to VSTis or have an old system that can't cope with the multiple filter algorithms of the latest plug-ins."
