,Rosasnabel,2007-02-03T15:51Z,"Actually i think that in simon the sorcerer the voices are veary important the sort of make the game what it is, that being one of the best games ever made"

I was using DOS Box and Daemon Tools and I strongly suggest, unless you got like DOS running at BIOS startup, or a really old machine with a floppy diskette input in it - just download this instead. It's just 12 megs, got both games + the text is in."
