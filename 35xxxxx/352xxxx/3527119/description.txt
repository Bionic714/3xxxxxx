Overwhelming, jaw-dropping evidence of foul play in the death of John Kennedy Jr., all based on official government documents: the search of the crash site was delayed an incomprehensible 15 hours; there was, indeed, a flight instructor on the plane, whose body is missing; it is clear that someone one on that plane committed suicide, shutting off the fuel control valve before plunging the plane into the sea. The prime suspect, George W. Bush, though very publicly running for president, disappeared the day of the murder and stayed missing for 3 days. Members of the press, seeking his comments on the death of another presidentâ†’s son, found that his staff could not say where Bush was, what he was doing or even when he would be back.
