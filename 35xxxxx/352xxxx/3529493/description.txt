Windows Vista RC-1 build 5728 (x86)

You can also download it from Microsoft here: 
 
http://download.windowsvista.com/dl/preview/rc1/en/x86/iso/vista_5728.16387.060917-1430_x86fre_client-lrmcfre_en_dvd.iso

You may use Beta 2 keys to install this version.

If you have got your key directly from Microsoft during Beta 2 preview program and haven't changed the hardware since then, this version will be activated without problems.

Pirated keys for Beta 2 will work during installation, but successful activation is ehh... "not guaranteed".

 There is no activation crack in this torrent - only original MS image.
