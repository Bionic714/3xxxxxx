A Deadly Dose of Wylde Psych is another wild compilation from Arf Arf that digs up 26 tracks of long lost American psychedelic acid rock from the mid-'60s. These tracks were recorded during an era when garage bands switched from "Louie Louie" and "Gloria" to a darker, yet no less inept, age of acid-influenced sludge. During the 78 minutes of Deadly Dose, listeners are introduced to beyond obscure bands with names like Chocolate Moose, Peacepipe, Lime Frost, Nite Watchmen, and Sweet Cherry. Most of these tracks sound like a combination of the Music Machine or Count Five with Barry Melton or Jorma Kaukonen on electric guitar at their most hallucinogenic. ? Al Campbell
