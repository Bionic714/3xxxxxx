,bluepoles,2006-09-17T05:58Z,Does this work with the Level-D 767???
,David-7237,2006-09-17T06:39Z,"umm, yes I believe the LDS 767

if it doesn't, use the bypasser(CMD+de-Flight1.exe) if you don't have that, search for it here or let me upload it...

either way, you will still need a working .lic, so a crack called LearbToFly.exe is needed for that...

ok Let me Upload that Bypasser with the crack in case someone hasn't got that"
,fattam,2006-09-17T06:45Z,Sorry to be a bother but any specific instructions? Thanks
,zippee,2006-09-17T14:59Z,"Thanks
This issue is de-wrapper related
Skysong sounds by A. Swindle use these wrappers BUT also, some of the later ones have their zip files password protected.
The A-4, F-5, F-18 & P-40 are examples of this
Does anybody have any of the above zip passwords?"
,David-7237,2006-09-17T16:00Z,"if any one has newcrackers, it would be awesometo share...

about those loaders, just open the F1 exe and use Reinstall Button and it will gen. a key use it to get it out"
