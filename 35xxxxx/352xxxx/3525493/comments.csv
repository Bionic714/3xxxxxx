,parlyzone,2006-09-17T18:24Z,"It's about 80/20, Most of them are flawless, others have a blur to it, but nothing noticeably.."
,parlyzone,2006-09-17T23:37Z,"Will be seeded in 8 hours... PC Maintenance!

Sorry"
,Kulturellt,2006-09-23T00:12Z,Nice! I've been looking for a torrent with seeders for season 2 for quite some time. Thanks for the upload
,DooDZVIL,2006-09-25T00:51Z,Can someone please seed?
,parlyzone,2006-09-25T10:01Z,"This torrent is seeded!

Maybe your settings aren't correct..."
,ryapeter,2006-09-27T04:47Z,What codec should I use. I'm halfway finished but the one finished can't be loaded/play properly
,parlyzone,2006-09-27T10:45Z,"Get this codec pack:

,-=[AcKe]=-,2006-10-01T09:48Z,does this really work or is it fake
,parlyzone,2006-10-01T13:36Z,"What is fake? Not the torrent, check the files list at the top (right above IMDB link)... I've watched every last episode of the episodes in this torrent, and they all work PERFECT!

It's seeded.. Trackers active.. 

""Or is it fake?"" ...I honestly don't understand the question?"
,Malendor,2006-10-02T16:16Z,is this prison break?
,-=[AcKe]=-,2006-10-02T22:20Z,is this al chapters fromseason 1 to 3??? its impossible
,-=[AcKe]=-,2006-10-02T22:24Z,"its going wery slowly, how much are you seeding?"
,-=[AcKe]=-,2006-10-02T22:26Z,jippis 53 days left
,parlyzone,2006-10-04T12:28Z,"""Is this Prison Break?""

NO! It's Arrested Development..."
,S@brina,2006-10-13T01:08Z,"Hello
I know you said this is not Prison break. Maybe I'm wrong but I have doubts about it because of the titles, it looks like Prison break story... Perhaps the name depends on countries, no ? I'm in Paris and you ?"
,S@brina,2006-10-13T01:11Z,"In the case I'm wrong, do you know which is the last broadcasted Prison break episode in US, if there is a 3rd season ?"
,parlyzone,2006-10-13T09:50Z,"Prison Break will return in 12 days!

- And its still Season 2.. There was 22 episodes of season 1, and there will probably be 22 episodes in  season 2.."
,S@brina,2006-10-14T02:53Z,"You're so kind ! thank u for these informations. I've download prison break episodes until season 2, 8th. Do you know if the next are available now? I'm definitely bitten !"
,S@brina,2006-10-14T02:59Z,"You've promoted so well arrested development that you make me feel contagious. I'm downloading your files. Hope it will be as breathless as prison break ! I'll let you kow
PS: is it a british tv show ?"
,ryapeter,2006-10-14T13:25Z,"You won't regret this series.

At the moment this is my fav. series Very Funny and addictive"
,ryapeter,2006-10-14T13:27Z,"Oh and sorry if I give impression I can't play the file properly. I just realize I haven't even finish downloading any of the episode completely that's why when I play it only play the part I've downloaded.

Hope this Seeds will keep going for long."
,S@brina,2006-10-14T22:53Z,"No problem, i didn't feel downcast by your comment. I'm 26% progress and i'm downlaoding since 2 days only. It goes quite speed. But now, because of what you're telling about this seed, I'm eager to finish downloading ! ;-) "
,Jorgo666,2006-10-15T14:03Z,Seeder pleas :(((((((
,S@brina,2006-10-15T16:52Z,"Hello !
If there's any prison break addict here, I wouldn't have mislead you. The last episode I have is 7th of 2nd season. 8th will be broadcast on october, 23rd only ;-( (I went on the official website)"
,S@brina,2006-10-15T16:56Z,"message to Jorgo,

I'm 39% in progress downaloding arrested development and I'm seeding the few I've download as well. So be patient, downloading takes time and more for such a file. As for me, I must say it goes quite speed"
,ryapeter,2006-10-16T05:07Z,"I'm in a country with bad connection. My max bandwidth 16kbps. Which at night I release the upload to 8kbps. But my download at 0.?kbps.

I'm not trying to say send me faster (I have plenty of time) But sometimes your speed just slow just relax.

PS: I'm slow dl'er at this torrent only but very fast on other torrent (6kbps on csi's)"

,parlyzone,2006-10-31T20:29Z,"To s@brina:

This is a comedy show, itÂ´s hillarious! If you want action, try Heroes or Rome.. Oh, and i highly recommend the comedy show Kenny Vs Spenny, i will put up a torrent containing season 1 and 2.. Hope you'll like it!

To -=[AcKe]=- :
This is ALL episodes from season 1 AND 2 AND 3, if you don't believe it, click Files, the link under Type and above Size and IMDB Info on this page that you are looking at right now, right in the top left corner.. ( You can also check the files with you're torrent client, the program you use to download, that will proof my point! Check these things out before whining about it, it will bite you in the ass!)


AND FINALLY FOR ALL OF YOU WHO THINKS THIS IS A SLOW TORRENT, IT IS BECAUSE PEOPLE FORGET TO SEED, THERE ARE MANY OTHER PLACES TO DOWNLOAD THIS, FEEL FREE TO CHECK IT OUT! THIS IS A BIG TORRENT, THEREFORE HARDER TO KEEP ALIVE!"
,chauncey_freak,2006-11-08T21:28Z,This is one of the funniest shows i have seen in a long time. Curb your Enthusiasm can wear thin after a while! Can't believe they aren't making more of these...
,ynnaDdy,2007-03-17T22:15Z,"Great torrent, only problems are a few low video quality episodes in the first season, and that in the third season some of the episodes are mis-titled. Ep11 is actually the finale, and 12/13 are 5/6, respectively. Try to watch them in order, or you may get confused :)"
,tex1ntux,2007-04-01T20:13Z,"Here's a list of mis-named episodes in season 3:
06 should be 08
07 should be 09
08 should be 10
09 should be 11
10 should be 12
11 should be 13
12 should be 06
13 should be 07"
,kabalizo,2007-05-22T09:37Z,Thanks. Finally get to see it in all its complete glory.
,killbush,2007-07-10T21:49Z,"One of the best sitcoms ever made. I can't wait to see it again, but with 314 days left to download, I might have to :S"
,Rebis,2007-07-24T12:01Z,67.2% Please Seed!!!

,manzter,2007-12-25T14:42Z,What a great show. Going to buy the dvd's when they come with finnish subs ;Z
,dare_to_share,2008-01-31T19:35Z,"Excellent up, I only downed the first season for now and the packaging/quality is great.
Most episodes are avi's and some are mpeg's.

video 9/10
audio 9/10"
,neo1072,2008-02-02T07:03Z,"Come on, people. I really really want to be able to finish watching.  Please seed!! I'm connected to 5 seeds but 40 peers are connected to me.  It's not fun. PLEASE SEED!!"
,isthisthereallife,2008-02-18T10:48Z,"unfortunately a couple of episodes in season one have audio sync problems, however the overall quality is excellent, I recommend this torrent/show in general
video: 10/10
audio: 10/10, -1 for syncing issues = 9/10"
,grrrnola,2008-03-09T19:27Z,took a long while to download but as it's 9 GB that's understandable. just watched maybe 30 seconds of the pilot and it looks funny. can't wait to see it. thanks for the up!
,Kjell16,2008-03-12T01:06Z,Please Seed!!!!!!!
,johnnytoobad,2008-03-21T02:52Z,"Took a while to download, but it was totally worth it. I will seed this for as long as possible."
,randal1013,2008-03-25T14:32Z,"are these DVD rips or TV recordings?

 and can anyone else confirm the misnamed eps that tex1ntux mentioned?"
,arab,2008-04-12T12:55Z,"What tex1ntux said is correct, there's a few episodes that are in fact labeled wrong"
,m1lky,2008-05-18T01:40Z,"I can't believe it took me until the second to last episode to realize alot of the episodes weren't in order.
I was confused this whole time for nothing."
,firesalamander,2008-05-26T16:59Z,"So many of these episodes aren't in order, and the video quality isn't consistent (some are small grainy mpegs).

For a FAR better series of rips, go here:

http://thepiratebay.org/tor/4132198/Arrested_Development_Seasons_1-3_DVDRIP_with_commentaries

All video/audio quality is the same - and great at that. And only two of the episode titles are mixed up. Plus it has the audio commentary as a second audio track!"
,diikheed,2008-09-16T01:26Z,"Oh come on, if they're going to be out of order, don't mislabel them! :("
,jaimeand,2008-09-29T06:08Z,"Thx for this wonderful serie, but where can i find the right subtiltles for this rip?"
,Donbakero,2008-12-23T23:40Z,"Well you're not the only one. Season 1 seems ok, the rest is seriously out of sync. I just finished season 3 and also found out. The uploader is a serious ************!."
,Del_Rio,2009-03-18T12:08Z,muchas gracias senor
,slothin21,2009-06-19T22:05Z,"Super Fast Download....probably the fastest 9+GB download ever! Thanks for uploading, and thanks to everyone else that made that happen!"
,captainLAGER,2009-06-20T03:58Z,"well parylzone if you really had watched every episode, wouldn't the mislabeling have come to your attention? Thanks for doing all this work, but the wrong episode order pretty muched ruined season 3. "
,jayk1982,2009-09-22T00:38Z,Errr.... Started watching it and series 1 makes no sense. It's the worst downloaded file I have ever seen. It is in absolutely no order. DO NOT DOWNLOAD if you have never seen the programme cos it will just get spoiled. CRAP!!!!
,mindy123,2010-04-06T19:26Z,"Season 3 is in a fucked up order, completely ruined it for me."
,chicken-,2011-01-30T00:46Z,"For all the idiots who can't do a little research and jump to insulting the uploader about the episode order.  Taken from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Arrested_Development_episodes#Season_1_.282003.E2.80.932004.29

""there are three instances where Fox aired the episodes out of chronological order. ""Charity Drive"" was aired before ""Visiting Ours"", but chronologically takes place after it; ""In God We Trust"" was produced and aired before ""My Mother, the Car"", but appears after it on the DVD; and ""Missing Kitty"" was aired after the two-part episode ""Altar Egos"" and ""Justice Is Blind"", but appears before them on the DVD."""
,omarbongo,2011-05-23T21:56Z,"Season 2 is in the wrong order. I don't understand why you would do that other than to be annoying. Wouldn't bother downloading this, there are better torrents."
,macaddct,2011-09-01T21:16Z,"Horrible audio and video quality that varies from episode to episode. Volume isn't even normalized from episode to episode.

S01E05 is 359 MB and 352x240 resolution while S01E08 is 115 MB and 432x324. Not even the same aspect ratios!"
,govermint,2012-06-24T07:09Z,"There in the same order as netflix has them, dunno why people are complaining, fix it yourselves or start uploading your own torrents haha...."
