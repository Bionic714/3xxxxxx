I downloaded this one from [b]www.bithq.org[/b]; it was uploaded by [b]ghostriderDK[/b].
I don't know the compression, but the quality is perfect. 
All the extra features (filmography, trailer) deleted, also the korean DTS audio.
I changed the korean subtitles for the spanish subtitles, so if you want to watch the movie with spanish subtitles, you must select the korean subtitles.

Para ver la película con subtítulos en castellano, debes seleccionar en el menú los subtítulos coreanos.
