Oh and pj27. Subs do work. Just click on ""Set Up"".

ps The only thing this rip doesn't have is ""Special Features""."

,susanyes,2011-12-09T20:40Z,"Having issues getting it to play on OS X 10.6.8 using DVD Player 5.4 or VLC 1.1.12 - it'll halt somewhere in a production company intro.
MPlayer 2 plays it, but there's a lot of graphics glitches, like it has trouble keeping up. I have no such issues with other DVD rips so I doubt it's a speed issue.. suggestions?"
