Laurel & Hardy - Anthology. PAL Region 2


Laurel and Hardy were hailed as "...the greatest comedy duo of all time...". Now, over half a century since their last film, 'Utopia', they are still held in high esteem by critics and the public alike.

This programme is an effectionate look back at this amazing act's career, from their early black and white silent film days, through the Hal Roach era, to their hugely successful British tours and beyond.

Generously laced with hilarious clips from the cream of Laurel and Hardy's films, as well as original colour film footage from U.S. government promotional films, this programme also includes rare newsreel interviews, and chronicles their amazing sucess all around the world.
