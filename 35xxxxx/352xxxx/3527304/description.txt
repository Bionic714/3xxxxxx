Mexican Latin rap group Control Machete burst into the local rock and rap scene in the mid-'80s, making its debut with the release of Mucho Barato in July of 1997. Led by Fermín IV, Pato (later Patricio Ch. Elizalde), and Toy Kenobi (Toy Hernández), the band returned in March of 1999 with Artilleria Pesada, produced by Antonio Hernández and Jason Roberts. In addition, Fermín IV recorded a song alongside Cypress Hill called "Siempre Peligroso," which was featured on the album Grandes Exitos en Español. He also participated in Chris Vrenna's project Tweaker and played with Los Angeles-based hip-hop act OMD. The long parade of outside work may have caused his exit from the band, just after his 2002 solo debut Boomerang. The rest of the band returned in 2003 with a new direction and a new record, Uno, Dos: Bandera.
