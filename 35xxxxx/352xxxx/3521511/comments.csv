,joebreezy,2008-12-10T18:50Z,DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS FILE...VIRUS!
,GenL,2009-01-20T11:41Z,No viruses. It is your antivirus who is mistaken.
,MammaKat,2009-03-28T19:08Z,Norton 360 found a trojan horse in this file. Twice!
[V],maestral,2009-04-26T16:18Z,"Norton finds ""Trojan Horse"" for all hacktools and keygens. So whatever is not LEGAL or its makin things supposed to be paid free is recognized as trojan horse. And usually theres no specific name of that trojan when the scan finishes, it just says TROJAN HORSE. Thats not dangerous, and it if has some name as backdoor or something then its real deal. So you people could get bit more informed about virus and trojans definitions.

Thanx for the upload."
