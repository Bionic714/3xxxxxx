The excellent 1975 debut album by this great Norwegian band. Very much in the same vein as Steeleye Span's debut album (classic 70's folk rock) and Fairports Leige and Leaf, this is pure class from start to finish. Featuring top quality male and female vocals and the perfect blend of electric and acoustic folk rock styles it doesn't get much better than this, even if you can't understand the language - freakemporium

This Norwegian folk outfit started out in the early 70s mixing acoustic instruments (fiddle, mandolin, banjo and piano) with the electric guitar, bass and keyboards. They created an earthy music made up of playful, catchy melodies with male/female vocal interplay. Despite important personnel changes over the years (their first-rate lead female singer was replaced, among others), they have managed to remain true to their sound and have churned out over ten fine albums between 1974 and 1998. In 2004, they reunited to play a gig at the Norsk Folkemuseum and don?t seem to show any signs of slowing down.

Their highest rated album is their third, entitled ?Vardøger?, closely followed by their first two, ?Folque? and ?Kjempene På Dovrefjell? released in the mid-70s, and by ?Fredløs? and ?Sort Messe? released in the early 80s. Their material is pure, often foot-stomping folk with Norwegian vocals. Despite the mostly minor keys, it is fresh and exhilirating and dons some wonderful arrangements. 

Highly recommended to fans of Malicorne, The Pogues, Kebnekaise and Gryphon as well as those heavily into Nordic and Irish folk. A good introduction is the recent live sampler ?Stormkast?. ?progarchives.com
