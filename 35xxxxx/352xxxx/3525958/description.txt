This compilation, released on Ladysmith Black Mambazo's UK label Wrasse Records, is a perfect example of their "Isicathamiya" singing, with this set comprising some of their most finest work. Although it does not feature the track "Wenyukela (Ascend Higher)", from their successful March 2003 release "Raise Your Spirit Higher", it does however feature other tracks from the album. These include the stirring "Wenza Ngani? (How Did You Do That?)", a song about a man 'transforming' another man from a racist to a 'non-racist'. The brilliant track "Inkanyezi Nezazi (The Star and the Wiseman)", used so succesfully on the Heinz Soup 1998 ad campaign, is also listed here - whilst a wonderful rendition of the classic hymn "Silent Night", sung in Black Mambazo's unique style and a live version of "Nomathemba (Mother of Hope)" finishes off this wonderful collection. (Incidentally, the former track is based on a true story that Ladysmith's lead singer Joseph Shabalala endured in the early 1960's). A nicely compiled album.
