This WILL work with 98se, but may have issues with XP.  However, you can go to the above link  to torrents or ISOs to the original Battlezone, which is just as great AND will run great on XP."
,Cyberdactyl,2006-09-15T03:07Z,You will need to open and burn this ISO to a CD and install. You will also need to have the CD inserted to play.
,Cyberdactyl,2006-09-16T07:23Z,"Also,  if you wish to play online through the regular Battlezone server to play online, go to http://www.battlezoneclub.org/invboard/index.php?showtopic=652
 an download the latest server file."
,Cyberdactyl,2006-09-17T00:45Z,"I may not have been clear on ""having the CD inserted"".

You must have Battlezone instlalled to play this game."

,spock.bz,2008-07-04T10:34Z,"this is iso of original bz cd. after installation you will need 3-4 patches to play normally. you can find them here - http://battlezone1.freeforums.org/.

there's bz1.4m installer which contains original bz + all those patches already integrated. you can find it here - http://thepiratebay.org/tor/4155384/Battlezone_1.4M.

if you don't have original cd, use image file and daemon tools from bz1.4M. they will be in folder C:\Program Files\Activision\Battlezone\EXTRAS after installation. "
,spock.bz,2008-07-08T10:10Z,http://thepiratebay.org/tor/4157262/The_Red_Odyssey_1.3M_(Official_Mission_Pack_for_Battlezone) - The Red Odyssey with all patches already integrated. It requires original Battlezone or Battlezone 1.4M (check previous comment) to be preinstalled.
,Proebetus,2008-09-08T21:58Z,Some one seed please!
,Spoork.bz,2010-12-03T05:54Z,The easiest way to play this now is at battlezone1 dot net
