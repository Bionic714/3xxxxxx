"Shin seiki evangelion" (1995)

In 2015, 15 years after the enormous catastrophe that killed half of the world population, another crisis has come - the unidentified invaders called "Angels" begin to attack human-kind. Any of their weapons are useless against the so-called "Absolute Terror Field". But now human-kind had created an exception;the ultimate all-purpose humanoid weapon "Evangelion". To operate this exception needs the minds of "Children", 14-year-old juveniles.
