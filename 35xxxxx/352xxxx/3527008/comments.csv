,mr.serv-on,2008-01-25T08:50Z,"Excellent quality, great download - 9/10
Sweet anime series. As with most anime it can get weird fast but it's a very enjoyable show. It also has one of the best intro songs ever."
,.root,2008-02-11T21:54Z,Is this all the episodes and movies that have to do with NGE? And in what order should I watch them?
,rappio,2008-02-12T13:26Z,seed it plz!!
,.root,2008-02-13T00:44Z,"Never mind, I figured out the order. This anime sounds wicked crazy from all the people I've heard it from. They go so far as to contemplate suicide after watching all of it at once. Pretty crazy. Nice seeding! Thanks =)"
,Kahonda,2008-02-13T08:08Z,"If you haven't seen the series before see it in one sitting, it will fuck you up. 
It's a utter and complete mind fuck.
You'll just sitt there and drool or contemplate suicide or perhaps att bit of both.

,Trotfox,2008-03-26T08:36Z,"First off, awesome torrent thanks for uploading.

The movies don't seem to be subtitled though, otherwise would be a 10/10 torrent. I find it a bit perplexing that no one else has complained about this."
,RevangeUs,2008-03-26T09:45Z,"I have to say thank's for this excelent torrent.

,Kahonda,2008-05-12T01:31Z,"Hmm... Download VLC at http://www.videolan.org or if you insist on using Windows Media atleast get some codec's ACE mega codec pack 6.03 is quite good or if you like anime and use alot of .mkv files download CCCP (Combined Community Codec Pack) or both... and please use Media player classic atleast dont use media player 9/10/11 they SUCK. 
ok? 
^_^"
,Max_Challie,2008-05-17T18:16Z,Why can't I get any sound? Both Episode 1 & 2.

,mcmxxi,2008-07-12T02:55Z,"Kahonda tnx alot 4 the upload, but i have a question 4 ya... Coz i have now idea how 2 pm here, so i'll ask here... There 2 movies there, death&reborth and End of eva... So which one should i view first? And r they both the official endings?? and 1 more thing, there said 2 be a remake of eps 21-24... Is it true, and r they rly different and worth watching?? Tnx, w8in 4 your answer =)"

[T],Zyphrus,2008-07-22T07:49Z,"Best anime mecha series ever.

Thanks!"
,colmshea,2008-07-23T01:19Z,"Im using VLC to play the files. However i opted to only download 'end of evangelion' and it would seem that the subs dont work. Do i have to download ALL the files before the subs work? There dosn't seem to be an .srt file.

Please help..cheers."
,Kahonda,2008-07-25T22:42Z,"If you don't get sub's in vlc on death and rebirth just right klick the video and chose subtitles and select ""track one"".

And for the other questions end of evangelion is the remake of the final ep's. and yes they are worth watching though you'l end up drooling and confused all over again lite the original ending ^_^ is'nt that fun?

And death and rebirth is a boiled down version of the entire series on 3½ hours or so... i prefer to just watch the series and the alternet endings but it's up to you...

Hope i help't a little. ^_^"
,poophy,2008-08-03T22:58Z,seeds plzz
[T],Ferrelas,2008-08-25T02:11Z,"Attention everyone, using vlc to render softsubs is BAD, thank you that was all."
,Sephy626,2008-08-31T09:20Z,"yes vlc is pretty bad for rendering soft subs, i recommend using zoom player it works flawlessly"
,Kahonda,2008-09-04T20:11Z,"First VLC suck's donkey ball's... (Just had to say that.)

Zoomplayer work's just fine but i still prefere MPC (or Media Player Classic for all of the people who just started learning about the finer arts of piracy.), but still scrap VLC and start using som codec's people the built in codec's of VLC can't handle Soft subs, matroska (matroska is the container format nown as .MKV) .WMV (Windows Media Video) or HD format's (like the X264 codec aka. H264 or the previously mentioned WMV who supports High Defention)...

Bottom line is download the CCCP codec pack from there--> http://www.cccp-project.net/
and enjoy HD Animé and other film's in all it's intended glory. ^_^"
,Moddex,2008-09-15T04:30Z,"This is a great anime series. I plan to become a very common seeder for this (currently providing 8.49 GB).

Let's work together to keep this alive!

For those having technical difficulties with audio, make certain you have the right Audio Codecs installed on your PC. Also note, some media players are non-compatible with the file types used in these videos. VLC media player is recommended."
,user117,2009-01-19T05:08Z,I'd advise the new divx. It now plays mkv's + it plays the files in a higher quality then anything else out there
,stakamaka,2009-01-27T21:13Z,"or use GOM...player........
this sucks.. it's hardsubbed? Why...."
,Kahonda,2009-02-19T21:40Z,Don´t know might be 'cause it's a old rip very old... The MKV (Matroska) container vas just in it's baby stage's...
,stakamaka,2009-03-01T04:42Z,sucks how no one knows GOM Player..
,TZPEAZOA,2009-04-02T02:16Z,seed pleeeease!!!!!!
,hannibal2323,2009-05-19T21:44Z,"Thanks anyway, but a dual audio English track would be nice. I know that anime purists might scoff at that, but it's hard to enjoy beautiful animation when you're busy reading fast moving text at the bottom of the screen. Pass."
,nomad-ag-ru,2009-06-06T11:44Z,please seed more!
,Laser Freck,2009-07-02T11:47Z,Use Media Player Classic with ffdshow you morons.
,Jokerz11,2009-07-27T18:35Z,Does this have english audio?
,Kahonda,2009-08-25T18:41Z,The Movie's Have Eng Audio And Japanese Audio.
,Aschilles,2010-01-14T09:51Z,icanhazseedz?
,PancakeMan13,2010-02-09T17:56Z,"I hope its a good anime. Ive seen Eureka 7 and I was overwhelmed, hope I get the same thing here. Thanks for upload/seed m8 :)"
,MeirLevi,2010-03-22T20:53Z,I'll seed too.
,Chriztoph3,2010-06-03T01:52Z,I can't get the English audio to work and I've got VLC and CCCP.
,NSL41288,2010-06-06T07:05Z,This version of the series looks terrible. I suggest getting this one instead: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4451712
,brokenbentou,2010-06-18T04:11Z,"thanx, will seed till 2011.what other animes do you have, im collecting, and 2TB dont fill with anime on their own..."
,iamZIIIM1,2010-06-19T05:37Z,"is anyone still seeding, iv'e had this torrent on for over a day but it hasn't registered any peers or seeders."
,wmk31,2010-09-06T00:14Z,this series is amazing and so if you liked eureka seven you will love this show 
,Onyz,2011-01-07T01:32Z,"I recommend finding other subs for ""End of Evangelion"" as A2000A's version sucks. Feels like the translator had no idea about the context, so it causes a bit confusion. Also, ""Death and Rebirth"" is actually ""Death(true)/(trueÂ²)"", as it doesn't contain Rebirth, which is pretty much the first part of ""End of Evangelion""."
,devilex,2011-02-08T03:38Z,I have VLC and both codecs specified and the subs on the movies do not work still
,zonova,2011-07-11T23:40Z,"You have to turn on Subtitles in VLC, under Video, it's the Subtitles Track.

Awesome series, thanks so much for the upload."
,OwenBicker,2012-03-29T19:10Z,It would appear this is Directors Cut. After I watch a bit I'll let you know...after it downloads of course.
