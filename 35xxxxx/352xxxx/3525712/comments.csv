Than YES my Friend you need to do stuff to y our psp

This means you need to MOD your psp or Modify

you can do it your self or you can pay someone else to do it

the way this works or what MODing actually means is your DOWNGRADING your psp version or software or firmware- same difference
To a more easier to ""hack"" Version of a PSP many years again 

to do this you need to get a pandora battery and a magic memory stick you could attempt to this yourseld but you can also ""brick"" your psp or FUCK IT UP!
then you will basically changing firmware to an earlier version! then you can put all these games you find here on pirate bay and other websites
games in PSX or ISO formats pretty cool if you have time, and are willing to risk buying a new psp everytime you attempt to downgrade
also there are tons of youtube videos on this , thats where i learned- and on craigllist there are tons of people who do for you for a small fee!
Thanks
Peace!"
