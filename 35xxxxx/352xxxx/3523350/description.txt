It's a tale of societies, murderous conspiracies and shocking revelations. But is there any truth behind the wildly popular novel The Da Vinci Code? Did Jesus and Mary Magdalene marry and have children, producing descendants that walk among us today? Did a furtive cult form to protect the 'bloodline of Christ' and did Leonardo Da Vinci hide clues about it in his best known paintings???National geographic takes you around the globe and behind the sensationalism to sort the fact from the fiction, as noted experts, hard core sceptics and dedicated believers search for the realty behind one of the most phenomenal, and controversial, bestsellers ever published.
