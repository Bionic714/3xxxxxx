[V],flyboy1,2006-09-14T13:14Z,Finnes det noe cover og CD-print til denne dokumentaren?

I don't have the cover myself..
The closest you can get to it, is if you goto:

http://www.cdcovers.cc

And look under the name:

Unlocking Da Vincis Code And Angels And Demons Revealed

That will be your best chance, unless you find it somewhere else.."
