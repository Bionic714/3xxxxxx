,Artuir,2010-01-01T06:29Z,"I understand this comment is 2 and a half years old, but no. As the torrent information states this is specifically from the first television series. So things like Macross II, Plus, 7, Frontier, etc. are not on here. This is all of the music (even the background stuff) from the first series with a ton of no-vocals versions for karaoke on the third CD."

,Enzo03,2012-06-05T23:15Z,I have been 92% done with this torrent for over a month.  Cmon! Can't someone who has downloaded it all seed as well?  Just 8% more.  Is that too hard to ask for?  Right now I seem to be the only seeder.
