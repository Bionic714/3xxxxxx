Yeah, these stars are "hacked", if that's an appropriate word for how much they have been modified. Their stats are beyond what the starmaker was designed to be able to give them, have a look at the Readme.txt for further instructions.

Don't bother complaining about their appearance or names, I don't care what you think, they were designed to please ME, I just figured someone else may like them too.
