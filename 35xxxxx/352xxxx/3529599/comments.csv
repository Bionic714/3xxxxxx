,tangled,2006-09-26T13:18Z,"dvd? hmm, this seems strange. the file size is all wrong aswell, can someone confirm it's the latest ep?"
,Stening,2006-09-26T14:38Z,"yes its the latest ep, but the quality is bad... i will wait for a new release."
,Cbytes,2006-09-26T16:13Z,"it originally comes in mpeg2 (dvd) format which most people cant play, for the 180mb file size for the quality is great... Anyone have something better to encode mpeg2 to divx or xvid let me know and I will improve it next week."
