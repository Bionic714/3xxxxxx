Every Extend Extra for PSP 

Created by Bandai and developer Q Entertainment and published by Buena Vista Games, Every Extend Extra is a puzzle game that, at first glance, resembles Lumines thanks to its slick visual style. Described as an action shooting game rather than a puzzler, the gameplay is set to a music beat as you build up combos and charge blasts to burst floating obstacles and avoid being hit down as you float through metaphorical virtual worlds built around concepts of human behavior. 

Remember kids - if you like it - buy it!
