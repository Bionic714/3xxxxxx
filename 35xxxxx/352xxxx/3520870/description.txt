If the Beach Boys\' lost Smile album, which Brian Wilson recently performed live, was a \"teenage symphony to God\", then Cloud Cult\'s Aurora Borealis is a grown-up symphony to the departed soul of a two-year-old child. 

Cloud Cult mastermind Craig Minowa\'s life is the stuff of Greek tragedy or the book of Job. An environmental activist, he used to have it all: a home and organic farm outside Sandstone, Minnesota; a wife, his high school sweetheart, Connie; and an infant son, Kaidin. Then, on 23 February 2002, Kaidin fell asleep to the somber strains of Mozart\'s \"Requiem\" and, for reasons that remain unexplained medically, never awoke. Connie discovered the lifeless body the next morning. The couple\'s shared pain would become too much for their marriage to withstand, and they eventually divorced.
