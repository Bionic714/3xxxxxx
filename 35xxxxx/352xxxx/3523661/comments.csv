,WinnieXL,2006-09-13T21:34Z,It works fine. I uploaded a half year ago and people were happy with it. 
,WinnieXL,2006-09-13T21:34Z,"Greetings guys.

This I found out today: 

Make folder and you name it what you like. 

Put all files together in that folder

Open cmd.exe
type: 		de-Flight1.exe FlightZone01_v102.exe

Next step is different from other cracker-wrapper methods! Wachout!

[ Do NOT CLICK ON: OK _ PRESS (ok) when wrapper started!! Dont touch this. Mov it away! ]

Just click on: next from installer FlightZone 01: Rhode Island.

Next as usual. Sometimes it asks for a restart, sometimes not. 


This is a really beautifull scenery with very friendly framrates. 

(AL-Traffic Progs are the main framekillers) 

//----------------Thanks PopArt for uploading new cracker wrapper here.
