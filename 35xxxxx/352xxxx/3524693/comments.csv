,BrejoSacor,2006-09-16T07:12Z,how do you get this to work on the ps2
,PDOG8SEAL,2006-09-16T09:37Z,burn with dvd decrypter
,mrwinner1,2006-09-16T10:57Z,Tack för denna ;D
,Tibbyhh,2006-09-16T12:22Z,"Hello, this is not working for me... I'm downloading it and then it says 21kb. Here it says the file is 999.77 MiB and when it's downloaded it says 21 KB!"
,barbalander8888,2006-09-17T09:48Z,"Den här fungerar utmärkt! Mina grabbar jublar!
Bara att packa upp med Winrar och sedan bränna isofilen med DVD Decrypter. Piece of cake!
Att sedan spelet råkar vara toppen är ju bara bonus =O)"
,SmOOOthdawg,2006-09-20T01:49Z,"THIS IS FAKE! DO NOT DOWNLOAD IT AND SPREAD THIS CRAP. IF IT WORKS AT ALL, YOU WILL ONLY BE ABLE TO PLAY A DEMO LEVEL AND THEN YOU WILL HAVE ONLY A SCREEN WITH ENDLESS STARS AND THE STAR WARS THEME. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS FILE!"
,PDOG8SEAL,2006-09-20T21:10Z,This works perfect for me nothing wrong!
,BOSNM8,2006-09-21T18:47Z,Lets see.. looks legit...thanks
,madhouserevival,2006-09-27T02:26Z,Burned with dvd encryptor but ps2 did not recognize it. Used a dvd-R disc. Trying nero and will let you know only if it works
,madhouserevival,2006-09-27T03:23Z,"I give up. Nothing works. How about adding a ""How to"" file to the download? "
,thalia,2006-09-27T20:51Z,Takk denne funker kjempe bra
,SmOOOthdawg,2006-09-30T03:54Z,"T-H-I-S  I-S  A  F-A-K-E  F-I-L-E. LOTS OF THEM ARE PURPOSELY SEEDED TO THROW OFF ANY ATTEMPTS AT SEEDING THE REAL ONE, ESPECIALLY WHILE THE CONTENT IS NEW AND POPULAR."
,nisse_danne,2006-09-30T19:16Z,funkar den eller inte för nu får ni allt bestämma er!xD
,pisosse,2006-10-02T17:06Z,"I couldn't get this to work with swapmagic 3

dunno if it's a fake but it didn't work for me"
,Skallekorv,2006-10-07T09:20Z,Fungerar 100% med chippad modul.
,CalleBalle94,2006-10-08T13:43Z,Hello guys do i need a modchip to play the ps2-games on the pirate bay??
,MelvinV,2006-10-27T17:56Z,can i burn these games with Alcohol 120%?
,Rcco3,2006-12-23T16:50Z,"Hey dudes,do I need to write all those files on a DVD-R unpacked or do I have to unpack all the files and then burn with Nero?"
,Hussam10,2006-12-24T20:18Z,"hej
finns det någon kan hjälpa mig att lada ner detta spel?"
,Rcco3,2006-12-27T17:56Z,"To make this game work:
1.Unpack any archive to get another one but don't unpack it.
2.Run NeroExpress
3.Select ""Disc Image or Saved Project""
4.Select the archive you unpacked
5.Burn to a DVD-R/RW
and that's all.The game works perfectly for me at least,but I'm lazy at keeping cd-s in perfect condition... "
,kph,2007-01-21T08:37Z,Works fine  for me... burned it with daemon tools  and nero .. thx uploader
