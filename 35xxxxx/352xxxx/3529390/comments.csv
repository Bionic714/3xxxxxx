,Bugenius,2008-07-17T21:46Z,"this ""mechcommander 2 (loaded)""-file has bugs and crashes often.

i prefer to download this original ""mechcommander 2.iso""

i testet it and it works perfectly, but you need a no-cd crack.


maybe you check this one too
http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3520299/MechCommander_2_ISO
but this ISO i havent tested yet, to less seeders."
,MechCommander2,2008-08-11T00:12Z,"There is no problem with the files. A proper nocd fix was never made for the game, just fixes that circumvent the copy protection. When you mount the disc to install in Alcohol or Daemon Tools it must be mounted when you play the game as the game will pull files from the disc during play, regardless of the install type full/small. If you don't have the disc mounted the game will sporadically crash."
,abdheil,2009-07-23T02:12Z,"The game is bugged cause I played until the mission 8 of the campaign and then y the next mission it doesn't load the next mission, it just close the game and says it couldn't load the game"
