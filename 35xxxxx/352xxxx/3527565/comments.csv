,barnie92,2006-09-30T18:55Z,why don't you seed blueboy?
,akuankka,2006-10-01T09:20Z,"What is going on here? I see only one seed, seeding from two different C-class networks, but even those are the same host, and all outbound traffic is disabled thus effectively not providing anything.... All the others are stuck at 24.2%"
