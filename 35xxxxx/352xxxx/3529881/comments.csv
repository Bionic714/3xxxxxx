,sardy,2007-07-11T19:28Z,"Review from a Maiden fan:  

There's just a single piano on all these recordings, no drums or other instruments (could have been released in MIDI format to save space!).

The piano renditions of the guitar solos are simply AMAZING and worth the download, especially if you're a musician as well as a Maiden fan... but during the lengthy verse sections it just tries to follow Bruce's original vocal melody - which gets tedious... quickly."
