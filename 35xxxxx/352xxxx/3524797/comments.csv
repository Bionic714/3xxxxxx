,KunfusedOne,2006-09-16T18:45Z,Maybe this one works? =T
,cykelskur,2006-09-16T20:09Z,loading isn't nuked and it works on my computer so...
,Robbie785,2006-09-16T20:19Z,"yea it's internal which i *think* means it's just supose to go out to group members, and isn't ment for public release, but a lot of the time they get released anyways.

i think sometimes it's so a group can show that they did something without their release getting nuked cause it's a dupe."
