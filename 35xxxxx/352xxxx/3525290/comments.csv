[T],Arrrrrrrrrr,2008-05-03T16:17Z,"When I first started downloading, there were no seeds on, but after a few minutes two or three showed up and the files were received (anyone who's going to try to understand these books had best already have a lot of patience!) They're all good and just as described (the author of General Relativity from 1984 is Wald not Ward though.) These classic books are hard to find, and I'm amazed that they are here. Thanks for providing them!"
