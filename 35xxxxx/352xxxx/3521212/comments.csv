PopArt or any other gifted ""seeder/releaser"" : Anyone got FFS SAAB 340? I don't think it has a serious protection system... Just a serial..."

,rrodger99,2006-09-08T22:51Z,"Thanks Belga1 but that is the manual for Project Tupolev.

I also have that 1 if anyone wants it...from what I have read it is a much more realistic aircraft.

I am not sure that I have the most recent version of it though."
,fjelrev,2006-09-09T22:40Z,Thank you but it doesn't work.Not posible to start any engine.APU starting OK.It seems to be version just for P2P network from IGFLY.

,meskalamdug,2007-03-01T13:42Z,"How to ""DISABLE AUTORUDDER ? "" 
In menus : settings/realism/flightControl/Autorudder, automatically turns ON ! 
i think aircraft.cfg or panel.cfg should be edited ."
