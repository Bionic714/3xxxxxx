2 things you will need to do to get this to work.


1. edit the aircraft.cfg file....change the [fltsim.4] to [fltsim.0] or the aircraft will not show in the listing.

2. When you load the plane you will get a window that says no panel data set yet. Just right click & choose close window & that's it.


This aircraft starts cold & dark so I hope you can read Russian.
