,Matrix_Cha0s,2006-11-03T11:21Z,"This is SHIT. install this crap and you will be locked up with no explorer, and safe mode will have no explorer either. Only way out is to use task mgr to start cmd and navigate to the hidden IE7 uninstall in windows\system32, and invoke it manually from the dos window.

THIS is file is pure CRAP. do not download it unless you want a pain in the ass, and a possible reload unless you KNOW HOW TO fix Windows MANUALLY."
