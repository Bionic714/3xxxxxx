,shager,2006-09-16T20:38Z,"hi all 
installed this and it has buggerd up my scenery of fs2004 anyone else had problems ???"
,belga1,2006-09-17T00:01Z,Thank's for upload.Installed it..test it...and noprobs nor with my other multiple sceneries... so dunno the prob described above.
,sinjun,2006-09-17T00:29Z,"Yeah, it buggered up my scenery too.  It's like everything is gone.   When loading a scenario the aircraft just sits in space.  The sky is there but all the ground scenery except the add-on stuff is gone.
Anyone know how to fix?
First thing I did was unload Flightdeck but it's still bad."
,belga1,2006-09-17T01:25Z,"Really..dunno what happened to you guys...I just install...and at the end of the install..it's install sceneries ..and when you start FS..you seen the set up sceneries as usual...NP.
Nevertheless it's a warning in the Readme about sceneries..etc..have you read it????maybe it's help."
,sinjun,2006-09-17T01:36Z,"Yeah, it's a weird one.  Hopefully someone that recognizes the problem will pop in and shed some light on what could be going on.
"
,sinjun,2006-09-17T04:57Z,"I have discovered what happened.  When I installed the software the first time, I let the installer make the changes to the scenery.cfg file at the very end.
My advice would be to hit cancel then go into the scenery library yourself and add the 4 carriers and the flatten files. 
When I let the program do it, it deleted the default ""scenery"" and ""texture"" entries from the scenery library thus rendering FS useless.  
I didn't know how to put them back, fortunately I have a recent backup of the whole program as I have it customized and was able to get back up and running with a minimum of fuss.

So... Do the scenery library additions manually if you want to be safe."
,shager,2006-09-17T14:51Z,"hi again 
well i have tried everything to safe my instalation of fs2004 but it's a complete uninstall for me , all the stuff you guys have uploaded has to be done again ,ah well keeps me busy , be very carefull when installing this addon guys 
it can f**k it up for you 
all the brest "
,belga1,2006-09-17T17:32Z,Have you try (if you have the problem with sceneries..) to erase the FS9 CFG and start again FS9.He will made a new CFG...I know it's not related with the scenery CFG...but this worked for me in the past with a same prob!!!
,shager,2006-09-17T23:41Z,"ok have reinstalld it and what you ""MUST NOT DO""is after the instaler has finished a screen will open with a tomcat landing on the carrier , click cancel , read the read me file and install the scenery manually , it's easy and alot more trouble than haveing to reinstall all the stuff you got from here !!!!
 keep up the good work guys
