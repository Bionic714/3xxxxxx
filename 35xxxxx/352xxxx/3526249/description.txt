-TAGLINE-
	 The popular villain/antihero from the classic "Kikaider" TV series 
stars in his own movie, as a dark defender in a post-apocalyptic future.

-WHAT THE THE BOX SAYS-
	It is the "far future" and the people of Jesus Town live in a "false utopia" 
ruled by a guy named Gurjev and his "cyborg enforcer Michael." There are some rebels that are looking for a new weapon to fight Gurjev and far from Jesus Town a "dark force begins to stir." Hakaider, who is a "destruction rider" is found by some rebels and Karou, a rebel, asks Hakaider to join their fight. Gurjev decides he needs to defeat the rebels and Hakaider "once and for all. "Will Hakaider prove to be a long desired savior, or an unstoppable force that will destroy all?"

-WHAT REALLY HAPPENS-
	Old-school Ultraman-type guy gets shot and blows people up. A team of "freedom-fighters" fight the machine, while the ambiguous leader yaks it up with the Hakaider V2,the "good version". They fight. Feathers fly (for some reason).

-Notes-
My first multilanguage release! Now, normally I'm all about the original audio. Dubbing is horrible and ALMOST should never be watched. I say almost because the only case in which you should watch a movie dubbed is if it's already bad, and you want to add even more hilarity to it. That being said, this movie is bad...and the dubbing is awful. I included the original audio, because that's what I actually watched it with and some may actually enjoy the movie without the super-cheese factor. That being said, for extra-extra-cheez factor, I recommend watching this movie with the English Dub AND the subtitles on. Usually dubs and subs do differ, but usually I wouldn't think that they would change entire contexts/plots of films. The dub is so different from the subtitles its awful. This is also the Director's Cut, which is 17 minutes longer than the original movie. As far as I can tell, the biggest differences were that there were no dream sequences in the original
release, but thats all I noticed in a quick scan. Enjoy!

PS. Make sure you have the OGG splitter so that you can play .OGM files!
