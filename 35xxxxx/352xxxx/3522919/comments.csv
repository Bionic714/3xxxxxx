GREAT PROGRAM THOUGH"
,Bibat,2006-10-12T21:48Z,Desinstalei o easy media creator 9 após pedir para registrar. Agora tento reinstalar mas o cd key não confere. Como devo proceder?
,aldoggy2001,2006-10-19T01:39Z,"after using this for a while it asks you to enter a activation code(not serial number)......Is it safe to login on to their system and get it? If not, what is this activation code?"
,purewood,2006-11-04T07:13Z,"Worked great for a week now asks for activation- if I click on OK for activation, after a few minutes it simply says that activation has failed... is there a keygen for manual activation?"
,bregelli,2007-01-07T22:41Z,i downloaded it very fast but doesn't work. The CRC is not properly the same so winzip doesn't extract file data1.cab
,NWE,2007-01-14T22:29Z,"BSA/MPAA/RIAA/whoever (spammer) tactic:

1. Upload appz with virus
2. Spam TPB appz comments with ""virus warnings"" and fake statements, to confuse people.
3. Sink PirateBay(!)

Will it succeed? Hmm... At least I download and my antivirus checks, as usual. It is rather pathetic after all.."
