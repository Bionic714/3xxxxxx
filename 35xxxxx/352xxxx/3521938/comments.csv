[T],WinstonSmith6079,2006-09-10T14:12Z,It is seeding!  Why do you say that?  Why do you say it twice in the same minute!?  Just d/l it if you want it.
,majtymicke,2006-09-10T15:45Z,"Ah, good old Diablo =) I would download it if only there was a easier way to find dropped items in it. That was later fixed in the sequel. I hope a Diablo 3 comes so we can enjoy that also =)"
,majtymicke,2006-09-10T15:50Z,The url for the first patch did not work for me since it wasnt available on that page for some reason. Got it from here instead.  http://www.planetdiablo.com/diablo/files/   Hellfire patch is also available on that page =)  Good torrent =D
[T],WinstonSmith6079,2006-09-10T22:17Z,"Kewl!  Thanks for the URL, man!  :)"
,yenlei,2006-10-26T19:40Z,"TheDarkv5.3 mod was released little over 2 weeks ago. This mod is the last remaining diablo/hellfire mod still in development after all these years. My thanks to the dark crewe and community helping to keep this epic game alive.

[T],WinstonSmith6079,2006-11-20T19:20Z,"Now THAT's excellent, yenlei!  Thank you very much for that!  :D"
,Xpoe,2007-01-05T18:57Z,"How the hell do I play this game???
I have the 4files what's next???"
[T],WinstonSmith6079,2007-01-08T01:53Z,"Use a prg such as Nero,  Daemon Tools, or (better yet) Alcohol 120%.  These are prgs that handle CD image-files, such as these.

In the case of Alcohol 120% (at least), it will create a virtual CD & DVD drive on your computer in which you can ""insert"" these virtual CD-ROM discs.  Then you can either burn them to blank CDs, or simply run them from your HD.

In either case, the games can be installed and run from these files."
,kazerooni,2007-01-16T06:24Z,"this is a SHAREWARE!!!

where can i find the crack to it???"
[T],WinstonSmith6079,2007-01-17T07:02Z,"Shut the hell up, kazerooni, and don't gossip like a bitch.

This is not shareware and only n00bs like you think they need a crappy crack for everything.  There is no crack because you don't need a crack.  Well then again maybe YOU do!  Just burn the CDs with the drive in your little ColecoVision and maybe you can play this, kazerooni...maybe ROFL!

Others: You don't actually NEED to burn these to blank CDs to play.  Just run the images through like Alcohol 120% or whatever."
,FuzzyBunny420,2007-07-11T10:44Z,Can this work in deamon tools? my burner is fuckerd so i dont wanna take the time to dl this if it wont work in deamon tools...
,Foggy87,2007-11-25T21:23Z,lets see some more seeders - im power uploading right now
,BulakVol21,2007-12-24T18:06Z,LOL the size of the installation directory is so small only 2.7 MB. I thought it was indeed only a shareware until i chose to install Diablo instead of install Diablo spawn. GREAT torrent man! Thanx a bunch!!!
,BulakVol21,2007-12-24T18:07Z,"for the noobs, it works on DAEMON tools!"
,Ferroun,2008-02-14T13:53Z,"After all those years from releasing of Diablo, it's nice to play it again...thaks for this torrent WinstonSmith6079, Diablo bless ya ;-)"

,ffej_123,2008-04-06T16:25Z,seed plz need to b done in 6 and 1/2 hours
,serabus1,2008-04-10T19:10Z,can anyone tell me why i cant get hellfire to work? diablo is working just fine but hellfire has a a problem (says no cd) anyways its saying something with a problem with the diabat.mpq file.
,serabus1,2008-04-10T19:16Z,sorry meant diabdat.mpq
,Danswan,2008-05-06T07:09Z,for all people who installed Hellfire: just use the original Diablo disk and play hellfire like usual because the hellfire is just an add-on to diablo so the hellfire will draw things from the cd. Also if you patch diablo to v1.9 you can play online even with pirated cd's
,Devils-boy,2008-06-22T15:15Z,"how du i get hellfire to work on xp??? 
i start the game and then the movie coms but then the game chrash"
,Armstrong14,2008-09-17T06:57Z,"There the hell did you get Halo 1 and 2 out of all this?  Smart comment dumbass.

Thanks for the upload! :D"
,JyggaKano,2008-11-18T22:32Z,Cool. I can get it to work but the colors get weird. Can it be because of I have Diablo Version 1.00?
,LordUDeep,2008-12-05T11:47Z,More seeds please. I wanna get this download complete as soon as in 5 hours.
,10dr.xtc,2009-03-02T01:49Z,i have been downloading this for 3 weeks now :( it says 10 people are online but i am downloading from0.0-0.2 kb/s..this is happening on all the games some with as many as 86 people online out of 256 seeders and i am getting about 2.1 kb/s...this is just people being selfish as i know you can upload much faster...so if you want to be selfish with your kb's then i will do the same and set my computer to do a max of 100 kb/s for all 19 games i have....
,10dr.xtc,2009-03-02T01:53Z,what they should do is make you sign up for this and make it mandatory that if you download something then you must upload at least 10x the amount or get booted....there is a site that actually does this just don't remember unfotunately :(
,Scrounder,2009-03-15T15:23Z,"I apollogize if this is a stupid queston, but, will this work with Vista? It won't let me use any of the patches."
,iRish_Pirate,2009-09-03T19:04Z,"For those of you who are downloading this to replay it, I highly recommend a mod called ""The Hell."" It makes a second playthrough much more enjoyable, and is available here:

,romanmoga1992,2010-03-11T02:22Z,"I'm getting a weird colour damage effect...purple, pink and white appear everywhere and ruin the game. I don't know how to finally fix it. Help?"
,vints22,2010-10-30T19:22Z,"thats because of windos 7/vista is not compatible, but i think if you right clic on the shortcut and check compatibility mode win xp, it should work if not also try 256 colour thing. or google it im sure there an unofficial patch for this"
