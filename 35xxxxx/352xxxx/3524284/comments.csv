,pr0pheten,2006-09-14T23:07Z,det funkar perfekt :p jag har redan fastnat efter typ 10 min spelande :D verkar ganska svårt
[T],Knaster,2006-09-15T10:30Z,Trevligt
,jonas_j,2006-09-15T14:39Z,kan någon mer som laddat ner det här spelet säga om det fungerar eller inte och inte göra som miffot xcamperx och länka till en spelsite som itne har något med torrents att göra...
,Astralia,2006-09-15T14:47Z,"Too bad they didnt stay with the graphicstyle they had in BS2  ... the more ""cartoonish"" style, its much much better and makes me remember the good old adventuregames such as Monkey Island, The Dig, Full Throttle etc. :D"
,pr0pheten,2006-09-15T15:23Z,Jonas_J Det funkar perfekt ladda hem cracket 1.0 på gamecopyworld.com så kommer det funka utmärkt :)
,MrFisk,2006-09-15T20:35Z,"The game workes with crack from gamecopyworld, no dissrespect to uploader but the game sux big time. In 2006 one may think they shuld make games that isen't played out with mouse only, finding things to click to get further into a 30's cartoon story."
,explodingtrousers,2006-09-15T22:14Z,"PLEASE HELP!!!!
can any one tell me how to keep the braker switch in the off position at the begining of the game, so i can get past the cables...????   
i have tried using the rope that was tied to the door but it will not work.......  is it me?  or is this a problem with the cracked game????   (like the godfather game, not been able to get in the car)"
,Borgheim,2006-09-16T10:53Z,"MrFisk you might want to thik b4 you open your mouth and make an ass out of yourself.
If you knew anything anout this game and its producer you should know that this is a game made out of nostalgia... more or less...

You may now remove your foot out of your mouth!

btw this game has everything handdrawn but uses modern shaders and renders and all that... makes it look less cartoony..."
,pr0pheten,2006-09-16T11:53Z,"Exploding Trousers
I have the same prob :P Cant come past the cables feels really bad that im stuck so short time in the game could anyone help us? =)"
[T],Knaster,2006-09-16T13:39Z,"i havent even gotten past the door lol.

Btw this game sucks oooooh sooooo much the sound file is broken u don't hear anything when the character talks and so on S.U.C.K.S"
,jonas_j,2006-09-16T14:06Z,"ville barar säga att den versionen jag tankade ner (inte denna uppload) behövde jag ingen crack till behövde barar använda ""securom loaden"" till deamontools som finns att ladda ner på deras hemsida...kanske inte funkar med den här upploaden men alltid gött med mindre ändringar i filerna som skulle kunna orsaka buggar :D."
[T],Knaster,2006-09-16T22:49Z,securom funkar säkert för det är bl.a byggt att sänka skyddet som är på detta
[T],Knaster,2006-09-16T22:50Z,men spelet suger enligt mig ändå vilket är synd eftersom jag gillar denna spelserie
,kauttio,2006-09-17T00:11Z,"To MrFisk
If you don't Recognize a adventure game when you see one, you must be a one dumb MF. I bet you are just about in the age of growing bupic hair. So focus on that and stop bothering the fans of real adventure games. PS. attend a few of your english classes so people can understand you. You BUMB FUCK!!"
,eqin0x,2006-09-17T04:19Z,"To Exploading, You should be working this out for yourself :P dunno how your gonna get through the whole game O_O, anyway To get past the cables if you go up on the same level as anna and then shut the door, and bolt it then right click the door click the little cogs and he then kicks the door the door falls over thus! creating a bridge for her to cross you then go down to the lever for the breaker switch and get her to hold it for you whilst you go down :) Peace."
,superman124d,2006-09-17T12:44Z,"OMFG! You mean the ""new"" broken sword games are point and click adventures as well? When I heard that they had changed the style I assumed they would 'update' the gameplay, thereby ruining the whole broken sword experience. So just to confirm... both this and sleeping dragon are p & c adventures right? Great! BTW Mr Fisk, fuck you! Don't abuse that which you dont understand... jackass."
,RagGAnoF,2006-09-17T16:50Z,bara jag som får error när man försöker starta det?
,brijones,2006-09-18T16:14Z,"rofl, point and click is great, but seriously, i hope this game brings something new. I loved monkey island."
,rephunter,2006-09-18T17:47Z,thanx for the torrent adventure games rock instead of button bashing fps
,superman124d,2006-09-18T21:05Z,"Quick edit on my last post: just downloaded sleeping dragon, fucking shit hot spot control system. Apparently this one is point and click. Eagerly awaiting a return to form for a classic series."

[V],Sejjtan,2007-01-02T18:52Z,Does anyone know if and when this game is released for xbox ?
,SoundWall,2007-01-16T14:25Z,"Everyone who likes this game, pleeeasse buy it!
The adventure genre of this type is dying more and more so if you're going to buy any game, please support games like this.

I don't think this will come to the XBox, only a few does, as they don't sell that well. If you want great adventures for the XBox then I recommend Broken Sword 3, Still Life, Fahrenheit (aka. Indigo Prophecy), Syberia 1&2 (don't actually remember if both were available on the XBox, but I know one of them were). You could check out Dreamfall as well, but it has a rather short, interrupted and unfinished-feeling storyline so I wouldn't recommend it.

PS: This series is possibly the best point-and-click adventure series there is."
,Ratmanslim,2007-02-10T22:27Z,"OK... Det här spelet är tyvärr inte så bra som jag hoppades på (som ett troget fan av Broken Sword så köpte jag spelet), men det är väl värt att ladda ner.
   Grafiken är tyvärr helkass. Värsta playtation sunkig pissgrafik från 2002 eller nått sånt.
   Slutet är lite väl abrupt, men jag rekommenderar stark 1:an och 2:an (Shadow of the Templars och The Broking Mirror). köp dem på megastore på DVD för 70 spänn (bägge 2 i en box!!!) och njut av nånting riktigt härligt.
   Spelen kopieras ner på datorn direkt - ingen skiva i sen - och man kan köra joxet på XP!!!

Två extremt bra spel för oss som gillar sånt."
,serson_person,2007-04-01T19:30Z,"Hey, I downloaded and installed the game, but it says it can't open DirectX.  I went to microsoft's site to install their newest version of directx, hopefully it helps.  Anybody know how to fix this?

I noticed there's no ""Adventure Company"" attached to this game.  Hopefully it's still as good as the third one!  And for the haters, ha ha ha... you're laughable.  Go play four hundred different first person shooters or GTA style games that never differ, because these types of games are INTENSE.  I love the old school point and click stuff ;)

I'm seeding for ya mofo's, hopefully somebody knows about the directx problem though."
