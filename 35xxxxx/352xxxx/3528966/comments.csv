Y.....I cant beleive somebody actually put this up. You be some weird ass Canadian like me. And yeah thats kinda cool. I havent heard this music in about along time...I lost my cd's in the great pot depression near the pawn shop. but now, it's all good and i dont have to go bug dave.
THANKS A LOT, is I guess, basically saying."
,perseid000,2006-09-26T07:04Z,"Nope, not a canadian, just american, but I've become of big fan of this music.  It took a long time find all of this music (This is all compiled from the old individual file peer2peer style).  I'm happy to pass it on.  I'd buy their if albums, but you never see any here, and I don't trust the band would get the cash.  I'd be happy to send them a check directly though!"
