Seriously underrated 1970 British popster Emitt Rhodes sounds so much like Paul McCartney you\'ll swear this is a lost Beatles album.  This guy\'s amazing, though-- recorded all of the parts himself at home in his studio, no small feat in 1970.  This is the first of his albums, occasionally available as imports on CD commanding a fairly high price, and damn hard to find anywhere.

This particular set of 320Kbps mp3\'s is a conversion I did in my home studio from my stereo reel-to-reel deck to my hard drive.  The fidelity of the recording is preserved in its original form-- I didn\'t tweak the sound, just split up the files for CD tracks and added some minor fade-ins-&-outs.  Considering the age of the reels, I think it came off pretty well-- the tape itself is in excellent condition.

If you love 70\'s British pop, you\'ll love this!  It\'s all good, but highlights are 
\"Live Till You Die,\" \"Somebody Made For Me,\" and \"You Take the Dark Out of the Night.\"  For more on Emitt Rhodes, visit: http://users2.ev1.net/~kryan73/emitt/themusic.html
