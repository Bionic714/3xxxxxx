I haven't heard this one in a looooooong time.
I got his 1971 issue ""Mirror"" on vinyl though.
I might upload it if anyone's interested."
,jester77,2006-09-09T03:15Z,"I have ""Mirror"" on vinyl, too. Unfortunately, it's not a great copy.  I also have ""Farewell to Paradise"" [great condition] and ""The American Dream"" [not-so-great condition].

If anyone else happens to have the ""Fresh As a Daisy from Hawthorne"" album, I would be much obliged...."
,jester77,2006-09-17T19:09Z,"Just got Emitt's ""American Dream"" on Russian import CD... wow, the jewel case is totally in Russian except for the song titles!  Will upload soon."

Seriously underrated 1970 British popster Emitt Rhodes sounds so much like Paul McCartney you'll swear this is a lost Beatles album. 

Emitt Rhodes is indeed underated and very influenced by The Beatles but he is an American from Hawthorne, California hometown of The Beach Boys whose influence is also evident in his music. I highly recommend any of his albums.
