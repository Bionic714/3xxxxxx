,strategy_fan,2006-09-13T21:43Z,"Sorry never put something on here before, didn't know about the IMDB link. :P

Got 2 more of these to come, but this one isn't even seeded yet so will put the 2nd one out in a few days time... (Bill Hicks: Relentless will be the 2nd one, and Bill Hicks: Sane Man will be the 3rd and final).

Enjoy. :)"

,rydecker,2009-08-03T21:54Z,"What am I supposed to do with 90 rar files, each containg an iso file??????"
,expose13,2010-01-06T22:02Z,"Screw up/downloading 4gb for one video.
Convert to avi for the rest of us who don't have 
unlimited bandwidth."
,expose13,2010-01-06T22:04Z,"@rydecker
select all of the rar files, right click on them and select extract to folder. It should extract them all into one folder together. Open the folder and you should find one complete iso."
