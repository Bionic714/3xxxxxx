I'm trying to track down an obscure (to me) track it was out in the eighties by a swedish rock band called ""trash"" the track was ""hot legs and black stockings"" can anyone oblige with either the single or album

many thanks in advance

ps please if you are able post in english for me since apart from knowing that finished is ""slut"" and there is a chocolate bar called ""plop"" my swedish is non existent . . . . stockholm rocks though .  . . "
