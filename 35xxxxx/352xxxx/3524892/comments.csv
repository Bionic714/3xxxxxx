Prisoner quarters (with beds inside)
Guard tower (adjacent to the prisoner quarters)
Then you have to build fences around it the quarters and another gate.

That worked for me ONCE and now i'm giving up on this game until theres a patch released."

Note: This procedure involves editing a game file; create a backup copy of the file before proceeding. Save the game. Use a text editor to edit the .FDS file in the ""/prison tycoon 2/data/maps "" directory. Scroll to the bottom to find the lines: 


0,100000,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 

Edit the second number to reflect the amount of money you want. For example, $900,000,000 would be: 


0,900000000,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,Khono,2010-06-06T09:33Z,"This game, as well as Prison Tycoon 3, are terrible games.  Don't waste your bandwidth or your time.

The user interface is unwieldy without there seeming to be much effort put into it and the game is full of bugs and ridiculous function (like guards not doing anything about prisoner escapes, etc)."
