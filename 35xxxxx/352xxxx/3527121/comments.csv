,aepZephon,2006-09-23T04:54Z,I was wondering if we could get a seed fer this so I can get past 90%...pretty please?
,lantig,2006-09-23T05:29Z,I need some seeds.  I have downloaded 521 MB so far and now I am dying.  My DL speed has been 0 for 2 days now.  HELP ANYONE!
,BurnHouse,2006-09-30T20:14Z,"Anybody know if this file actually works. It'd be pretty fucked up if I were stuck at 91% (much like my peers) and it didn't. If I ever get it, I'll say if it's worth it."
,BurnHouse,2006-09-30T22:39Z,PS: Please do seed.
