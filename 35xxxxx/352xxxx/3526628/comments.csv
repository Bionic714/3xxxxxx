,Eproxima,2007-02-01T19:46Z,Ok.. after nearly 300 hashfails i take a look at my peerlists... hmm. half the IPs starts with 38.100.x.x so i warn you all to ban theese suckers because they poison the torrent.. You download half the piece. and some other finish it.. and they get banned.. just search google for: torrent 38.100 and you will see :(
