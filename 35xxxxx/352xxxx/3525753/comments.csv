Well I'm a newbie when it comes to theese files but I like to try out HD material on my TV.

Does anyone know how to play this movie the best way. I usualy use Zoom player but it says the moie is about 30 some minutes and no sound.

Should I use som prog to join all the files to one? What about the sound? Some codec?"
