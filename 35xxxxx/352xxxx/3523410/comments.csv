"
,Bamimi,2006-09-13T10:51Z,anyone test this out yet?
,rakketman,2006-10-03T17:58Z,"Nice !
this program works perfect and the keygen works very good.
cheerz"
,jaakarit,2006-11-03T16:05Z,When trying to register it says: there´s a problem connecting to sibelius on the internet. If somebody has the same problem and knows how to overcome it please help. 
,dodginess,2006-11-30T02:15Z,"No problems with this one, but maybe there's a bit of confusion over the registration:

1) start the keygen program, then copy and paste the *serial number*
2) start the install program
3) run Sibelius then enter your name and serial number and click 'Register Later'
4) when Sibelius starts up you'll be told that the software only works for 15 days until you register, so go to the 'Help' menu at the top right of the screen and choose 'Register'
5) Choose the 'Register by post/fax' option then, on the next screen, get the *machine code* you're given, paste it into the keygen app then copy the new *registration number* generated and paste it into the relevant back in Sibelius
6) Everything should all be working now!

Thanks zer0-g! :)"
,crapthecrocodile,2006-12-19T10:00Z,"Keygen does not work. When you double-click it, a dialog box says:'Windows cannot find the file specified. Make sure you have correct access to it...'. What's wrong with my keygen?"
,cobr11,2007-01-19T20:52Z,"PLEASE HELP!
I don't get anything of this shit!

I installed sibelius 4, restarted my computer, but when i start the program, it says it's a demo version and I don't even have the ability to register!   PLEASE HELP"

,roth001,2007-02-28T21:41Z,"HELP

Installer comes up with something about H20 Try before you buy software..then disappears..having installed nothing and ended the process. Keygen works fine"
,thegreatandmightyme,2007-03-03T07:18Z,It took me two months to find a good copy of this.  I'll seed for a day or two.
,sharkzpt,2007-07-10T21:07Z,and sibelius 5. do you have it by now?
,pirraa_,2007-08-23T14:06Z,"Yep. I have registered it and it´s working fine but.

Why so...

,phantompirate,2007-12-14T04:09Z,"I can't seem to hear any playback at all. I hear the startup music, but none of the other sounds. Does anyone know how to fix this?"
,tripleX999,2007-12-28T17:39Z,"Works great!

Thanks a lot and also thanks to dodginess for the instructions!"
,tripleX999,2007-12-29T22:21Z,ok very strange - installed fine on xp yesterday but won't work on vista - says 'corrupt file'
,tripleX999,2007-12-29T22:22Z,"oh yeah, phantompirate - i had that problem and solution for me was to double click the volume icon in the taskbar and unmute SW Synth. dunno if its the same problem but hope that works"
,phantompirate,2008-01-01T19:15Z,tripleX999-Thanks! That made it work perfectly.
,thenetpirate,2008-01-06T00:16Z,"hey, i've just installed sibelius and registered. But I've got the same problem as phantompirate: I hear the start up signature but no other sound. I have clicked on the volume symbol in the taskbar but I don't even have any sw synth to unmute! what should I do?"
,Parkmanium,2008-01-06T19:35Z,Thank you very very much zer0-g! Will seed a week!
,tripleX999,2008-01-07T18:27Z,Has anyone installed this on vista? Is it just me? (I got it working fine on xp)
,tripleX999,2008-01-07T18:29Z,thenetpirate - try clicking the volume icon again and then go options -> properties and if sw synth is unchecked then check it.
,Phorat,2008-01-08T19:51Z,"WTF?  I unrared everything, ran Keygen, ran setup, but when I try to start Sibelius, I get an error:  ""missing GDIPlusWrapper.dll"""
,Phorat,2008-01-09T01:10Z,Works OK now. Thanks!
,SilentSombra,2008-01-10T22:34Z,"I'm having the same problem as pirraa_

None of the images are working"
,buffjunkie,2008-01-12T00:19Z,"Please Help!!  I try to install but the program freezes.  It starts installing, gets to about 1%, where it is installing a helskinki font, and freezes up.  Any ideas?  Thanks!"
,yellowcrap,2008-05-01T12:54Z,"Hi pirraa_, SilentSombra and everybody else.  To display the graphics correctly:

1) Open the control panel
2) Click on National Settings (or whatever it is named in English. Sorry, I only have Swedish Vista.) and go to the last tab.
3) Change the language for programmes that's not supporting Unicode to English (or any other language that use the roman alphabet)
4) Restart you computer when you're asked to.

It should work fine now."
,StrongEU,2008-08-28T02:50Z,"Thanks, after a while it started to download faster, I will keep seeding for a week out gratitude, maybe three (Hey, philosophical question: is that paying it forward, or back?)

Use 7-zip (it's free) or WinRAR (40 day free trial) or a similar app to decompress."
,straemer,2008-12-10T23:29Z,"I have the same problem as buffjunkie, any solutions?"
,NatalieA9,2009-01-09T21:53Z,"OMG IT WORKS! I have to say I'm surprised! I was like no way for 30MB. But thanks so much! And thanks doginess for the instructions I couldn't have got it otherwise. By the way, one problem I did have was with the key generator. If anyone else has this problem try temporarily disabling your virus protection (this torrent is VIRUS FREE) Hope it helps!"
