,odlumb,2006-09-24T21:46Z,"MP3 became popular at a time when ADSL, cable modem, and other medium speed internet connections were not readily available. It was originally considered to be an ?interim solution?, a compromise until network speeds across ?the last mile? improved. Somewhere along the way, probably with the marketing success of portable MP3 players, MP3 became a permanent fixture in the networking environment.

Unfortunately, MP3 is not a lossless compression scheme. If you have poor hearing, OR if the music you are listening to has a limited frequency range, the difference between MP3 and 44.1 kHz at 16 bits is negligible. On the other hand, if you have excellent hearing AND the music you are listening to has a full frequency range, the difference between the two is substantial.

With most popular music, about the only instruments which ever go above 6 kHz are the drummer?s cymbals. The majority of popular music can be MP3 encoded with very little (if any) loss of acoustic detail. The same does not hold true for a lot of classical music, and especially for electronic music.

Many people today who habitually listen to music at extremely high volume have permanently damaged their hearing. The ability to hear high frequencies is always the first casualty.  For such people, MP3 sounds roughly equivalent to 44.1 kHz even if the music contains a very wide frequency range, because they can?t hear high frequencies even when they?re present."
