These are my first nine finished compositions. The are composed entirely on the computer, weaving together all of the many musical influences in my life.

None of these works fit well into any of the acknowledged contemporary musical genres.  I describe my own style as ?world classical electronic orchestra?.  Starting with a strong Western classical foundation, especially the tradition of counterpoint, I weave in American folk music and Bluegrass, Spanish Flamenco, Rock & Roll, Japanese Koto and Shakuhachi, Indian Raga, South American folk music, and North African Arabic rhythms. My orchestration includes native instruments from all of these styles, as well as a wide variety of electronic instruments that have no equivalent in the acoustic world.

My music is complex - too complex for the pedestrian taste of the average contemporary listener who is an aficionado of Rap and Hip-Hop. I make no apologies for this. If you don?t appreciate classical music, or if more than two independent melodic ideas tax the limit of your musical sensibilities, it?s probably a waste of your time to download my works. On the other hand, if J.S. Bach and Jimi Hendrix both fascinate you, and you wonder how such diverse musical styles might be blended together, there is a remote chance you will find my music interesting.

Each work is accompanied by a few written comments by way of background, providing the listener with a glimpse of the motivation and intention that brought each composition into being. Here are the titles and durations:

Bach Rock Japan 8:15
Triptych - Visions of a Dying Queen 13:32
Las Pamapas por la Luz de la Luna 11:30
Rise Above 4:11
Sheltering Sky 12:47
Moorish Dream 11:50
Elegy ? Farewell Beloved 18:23
Europe After the Rain 15:52
Granada 20:50
