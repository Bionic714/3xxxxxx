,Miguel28,2006-09-19T02:13Z,They're both original DVD5
,spunky1a,2006-09-20T07:34Z,"hmm, 2% for a day, nice..."
,Miguel28,2006-09-20T14:54Z,"I'm sorry for the ""slowliness"" but i'm giving all i got, so we have to be patient"
,spunky1a,2006-09-21T13:09Z,"Seeders: 9? and 0.2% for a day? what to hell...

is this a other tracker?

ok, i kick it, thx..."
,wales,2006-09-21T21:37Z,"I agree with you, look at the stats, downloaded 682 times and only 1 seeder(now and again).   This is almost the same with all the other Elvis films.   Why bother to upload if you cannot seed it properly.   Don,t get me wrong i appreciate it but i just wish people would share and not hit and run."
,Miguel28,2006-09-22T13:32Z,"For the miliionesiam time, those users are FAKE, they are not downloading from me, they are not downloading at all, because they simply don't exist, it's kind like a bot. This ha+ppens only with torrents from Pirate Bay, anybody knows how to block those fake users?"
,Miguel28,2006-09-22T13:35Z,"And please, don't get me wrong for this, if you're not in the mood to wait to get the all movie, just don't download it. I know it takes time, but i'll get to you all, wouldn't do it other way."
,sleepyman2,2006-09-23T17:57Z,"Thanks for the great uploads Miguel28, and yes the statistic on the PBT is false, please continue seeding, the ones there are not patient to get the movies, too bad. I'll wait, I whant them. Thanks."
,PeGe1963,2006-10-08T22:37Z,"Hallo!
Why does it take so long time to download some of the torrents here at TPB? For example this one. I started downloading it almost immediately when it came up. It downloads very slowly and then it stops for some days. Then it?s downloads a few percents again. I?m at the moment 17.7% after 2 weeks and so are 45 other leechers. I don?t halve this problem with any other torrent-sight."
,Miguel28,2006-10-08T23:10Z,"Sorry, it's my fault, i've downloading some stuff and the upload decreased
I'll be fully uploading from now on."
,PeGe1963,2006-10-09T06:44Z,"Hallo Miguel!
I donÂ´t think thats the problem, because itÂ´s all to gether almost 30 full copies out there that are being seeded."
,Miguel28,2006-10-12T17:20Z,"Anyone who's interested in being a part of a great Elvis Forum, please contact me... lots of free stuff"
,sleepyman2,2006-11-25T18:29Z,"Please Miguel28, we are in very low speed mode, please help us with finishing these two movies. Thanks."
,troiboii,2006-11-27T13:46Z,"hhmmm. been downloadin this for 3 days, i have 20 seeds showing in azureus  but am connected to any of them, strange...

,The Soft Touch,2006-12-06T14:11Z,"THX Friend....

Happy Christmas"
,sleepyman2,2006-12-06T16:13Z,"Thanks my friend, some more Elvis classics with danish subs? Anyway mery christmas to all of you out there."
