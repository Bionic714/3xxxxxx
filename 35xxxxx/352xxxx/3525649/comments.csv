aww, what the hell... let's see, maybe it's the pope kissing the koran,hehe. (yes i know that he indeed has kissed the koran, so what?!)
it's all one giant association of the three big religions, right?! together they are trying to fulfill gods will on earth, right?! ...fuck lol.
thx for the upload."
,tomtomx,2006-09-18T00:33Z,The pope has the nerve to insinuate that islam is a violent religion. The arab fundamentalists react to the grave injustice and totally unfounded accusation by shooting christians and throwing bombs in churches... 
,GaNjaMaaN,2006-09-18T01:31Z,The Muslims does it again!!! and proves exactly what the pope said about them to be true.
,Orthafix81,2006-09-30T01:53Z,"What you guys have to distinguish is Islam and muslims. Islam is the religion of truth and peace, while muslims are falable and some maybe even violent. But violence can be found in abondance in the western society to. 
Take for example UFC - Ultimate fighting, people beat the crap out of each other, for what? Money and pride! Well that's one heck of peacefull society, that aloud that to take place! 

And that's not all. Take a look at how much money and live's getting lost due to all the alcohol consuming in the western societies. 
Now that's something you should get concerned about before you go critisising others!  "
,tomtomx,2006-10-03T20:27Z,Muddu: The tought that all non-muslims will go to hell is interesting. That means that all of mohammeds forefathers are burning for ever. Along with everybody else that had the unfortune to be born before mohammed. And along with all the now living non-muslim saintlike individuals all over the world. Do you really think that your god is that narrowminded and cruel? If so... Keep him.

Firstly: What you must understand is that the followers of the prophets before Muhammed, like for example Jesus, Moses, Abraham, etc. where muslims (i.e. they submitted to the will of God). So all muslims will ultimatly go to paradise, whether they lived before or after Muhammed.

Secondly: Those people who never got to know about God's religion or had a wrong understanding of it will on the Day of Judgement be treated differently from the one who knew the truth, but rejected it. God won't just punish people for no reason (and no, God is not narrowminded and cruel). He has left us to make our own choice of wheither we will follow the path of righteousness or not. So in that sence we choose for ourself to either go to paradise or to go to hell.

Now, you know the truth about the matter, and God has given you the free choice to either reject it or accept it, and by rejecting it you choose the eternal fire of hell and by accepting it you choose the eternal pleasure of paradise.

I advice you to at least accuire som knowledge about this (you won't lose anything to do it), because of the seriousness in the matter. Do you wan't to take the risk of going to hell, when you know that this would mean an eternal torment, which never, ever ends?

And if you still want to be ""narrowminded"" about it, then you can't blame anybody but yourself if that's what your end is going to be, because you have choosen it.

Like I said you won't lose anything to accuire some knowledge about it, not even your ""precious"" time, because then at least you've got some more or less knowledge about the most missunderstood religion (in my eyes) in the world, and hopefully got yourself going in the right direction. (Maybe this videos can assist you;))

You know the truth, there is one God and He is the only one worthy of our worship - this is the natural belief in every human being, even you (even if you would verbaly deny it, it's in your subconsiousness).

Now take care and have a nice day!!! "
,tomtomx,2006-11-08T23:29Z,"Thanks for the sincere answer Muddu. I don't share your conviction. I don't really believe in heaven or hell. I have always been very interested in the religions of the world however. I recommend you to sincerely study some of the other world religions. Not to convert you, only to widen your understanding and tolerance. 
By the way. If all the biblical figures were muslims  (i.e. they submitted to the will of God). Well... Then all of the religious people living today are also muslims. Regardless of their religion... (!!!!) And if only people that call themselves muslims are muslims, well... The none of the biblical figures were muslims either..."
