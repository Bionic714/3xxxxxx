,mechaone,2006-09-25T09:31Z,"Hey guys. Hope all is well with your installs.

""All Device Drivers ( About 3 GB Are integrated )""

Does this mean they aren't easily removed or deleted, as they were in the weird version compiled by Amit Talkin? I prefer this, as it frees up unecessarily used space on the drive, and allows me the option of picking drivers, rather than having them autoload.

Thanks - mech"

how do we know this isn't a 3rd party link?"
,moon69,2006-09-25T21:48Z,i cant instal the driver for my nokia 445pro
,moon69,2006-09-25T21:49Z,nokia monitor 445pro
,mechaone,2006-09-26T07:48Z,"Ironically this would be a third party link scenario, as this build was compiled by Amit. I like his work, but im wondering why my PC takes forever to shut down now. Any hints or leads guys? have any of you had problems with 4+ minute shutdowns at all?

,weirdigge,2006-09-26T08:59Z,"Like mechaone i've noticed the extreme shutdown delay. What's it wating for?
I've also noted that with this installation some
applicatons have ridiculously high cpu load.
Tried another xp installation on same computer and it worked great. I will however test it some more."
,weirdigge,2006-09-26T20:50Z,"solved slow shutdown:
mark controlpanel->bootvis->empty choice on list, then press save.
run botvis->trace(menu)->optimize system
reboot

The problem with slow computer in solidworks soled temporarily.
move dragbar for hardware graphic acceleration
to minimum, however it works with a swedish version of XP i tried it on so something is not right here."
,mechaone,2006-09-27T18:31Z,"Hey guys. Seems my slow shutdowns have been eliminated. Not sure what was causing the problem... It was something slowly saving to disk before shutdown. Till I tweaked the system and this stopped occurring I had to shutdown / restart the pc from the task manager window. No harm done though, Ive got an old 1 ghz cpu which could have explained the issue as well.
Best of luck with your installs and such.

,QuicSilver,2006-10-01T05:13Z,"DO NOT UPGRADE from a previous install, or it will ask for a serial. You must do a fresh install, if not it's up to you to find a serial."
,QuicSilver,2006-10-01T05:14Z,"Quote from info:
-You must Install this windows by booting the cd....so it wont ask u for attending installation process..like CD key, timezone..etc!"

,gregory4658,2006-11-26T20:58Z,"Good Program some errors though.
No Sound could not find Dpsfnshr.exe
Lock during install but reset and it restarted and completed install.

Seems to work so far."
,gregory4658,2006-11-27T03:17Z,"This version is altered to not allow Virus protect programs to run properly.

My Panada Atnivirus 2007 would only run on low setting. No searching for viruses or any harmful content. When ever it did the program locked up. Tried another from this site and no problem with Virus program.  This is not SP3 just a SP2 with updated drivers. 

        It can run but with no Virus protection may not be worth it."
,realking,2006-11-29T13:04Z,I can't install it. It says insert windows XP SP2 install CD. Can anyone help me please??
