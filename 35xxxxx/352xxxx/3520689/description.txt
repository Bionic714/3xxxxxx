Maximum Pool, an overall enhanced version of the undeservedly overlooked 3D Ultra Cool Pool, is a treat from 

start to finish. Despite its colorful, family oriented presentation, you won't find a better simulation of the table 

sport on shelves, with the possible exception of Interplay's soon to be released Virtual Pool 3. Sharks fending to 

lay hands on their custom-made cues can quench their thirst in one of the many available variants which range 

from run of the mill flavors such as Eight Ball and Basic Billiards to more exotic fare like Cutthroat and Snooker.
