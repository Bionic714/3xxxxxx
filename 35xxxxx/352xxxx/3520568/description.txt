The Wild World of Hasil Adkins
1993

A documentary on Hasil Adkins, the great innovator and madman of rockabilly. This documentary chronicles Hasil's boozing, womanizing and law-breaking antics. Filmmaker Julien Nitzberg's odyssey to bring The Wild World of Hasil Adkins to the screen is most telling: Shooting was held up for a year when Hasil threatened to kill and kick the director. He sure is a character.
