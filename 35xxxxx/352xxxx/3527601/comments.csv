,frasse0073,2006-09-22T16:39Z,This program is very good. 
,uraphake,2006-09-24T09:27Z,"This program doesn't rip DVDs, it converts video files to DVD format and even creates a simple menu with which you can put whatever background image you want. It's very fast and the quality is great. Creates NTSC, PAL, 4:3 fullscreen, 16:9 widescreen, chapters, any font, font size, color, etc.
Easy to use and highly recommended!"
