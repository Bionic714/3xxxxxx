,olav66,2006-09-08T19:11Z,"Nah... he's seeding but is SPREADING his bandwidth way too thin. When will you uploaders learn your trade? This is a huge torrent and the uploader's also got 2 other chunks going at the same time. That doesn't serve anyone... 7% in 7 hours??? Hey that's so ridiculous... to the rest of you: learn how to open ports for incoming traffic; it will hugely benefit those who dare :-)

And after completing, keep on seeding. If you really can't wait to listen/watch, simply copy your downloaded torrent to another location and burn it from there. Yeah, it occupies double the size but you're doing the swarm a big favor..."

,tinuviel949,2008-10-28T18:57Z,"you can bitch about seeding all you want because the people are fucking selfish as they come but where are the specifics, ie. are the subs in english cause I hate to tell you they're either IN Italy or speaking Italian half the time. The rest of the godfather 2's have swedish subs and what the fuck do the swedish need with the godather.

thats how to properly bitch children, come back next week for ""how to run old fat fucks over with your car"" in ENGLISH"

,dannychris,2010-04-02T15:22Z,"Arguably the best sequel ever made, The Godfather: Part II tells two tales: the beginnings of Don Vito Corleone's (Robert De Niro) life and career in the mafia, and the rise of Vito's son, Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) as he takes over the family business. Beautifully shot and intricately scripted, the two stories are symmetrical in plot and equally engaging. Godfather II was honored with six Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Supporting Actor (De Niro), Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Art Direction, and Best Score. Notably, it's the only sequel in Oscar history to win the Best Picture honor.

Danny... Thanks mate's"
