I've seeded almost 30 GB of season one and 20 of season two. Hope everyone seed them, because they are really good."

,MikeAK47,2008-04-11T12:26Z,"Hey there's nothing wrong with the quality, it's excellent. Thanks for uploading!"
,lampss,2008-04-13T01:43Z,"Thanks a lot, dude! Your torrents obbey the standard that i think everyone should obbey: they're organized, have a good quality and a good range of subtitles. 

Valeu velhinho! Vou continuar semeando a segunda temporada, e parto agora para a terceira. Muito obrigado, cara."
,Evil_Laserlord,2008-04-16T18:59Z,You rule!
,sominus,2008-05-06T16:56Z,"Remember these are old episodes. TV wasn't HD back then. So these rips are the best around :)
I've seen Seasons 6-7 and the quality is amazing.

Let's help keeping this classic online!"
,jthm,2008-05-19T05:55Z,PAL NTSC?
,jimmyfingers,2008-05-23T20:26Z,"DO NOT DOWNLOAD!
This is a great quality season but there are subtitles. Sometimes the subtitles are even right in the middle of the screen. It is ridiculously annoying and not worth the download."
,X-FilesFan,2008-06-12T23:00Z,"I've finished downloading, and am seeding it now. But how do I watch it?
What program should I use to put it onto a DVD?"
,milesaway10,2008-06-23T21:32Z,"Sou fã dos X-Files. Graças a você tenho todos os episódios e com boa qualidade.
Muito obrigado por partilhar."
,Schlangermann,2008-08-01T01:36Z,"Thanks alot for all the seasons!:D I´ve downloaded number 1 and 2 now and all of them have worked perfectly:D  Velhinhocego, you rock! Keep it up:D"
,ploinktiploink,2008-08-05T02:15Z,I'm at a VERY slow speed here. Annoying. All the other seasons are going about twice as fast as this one. :(
,Dodecahedron84,2008-08-08T22:47Z,Thank you for your upload! I wish all files were as organized and well seeded.
,Kruszakus,2008-09-08T11:01Z,Seed you a-holes! It takes even 5-7 hours to download just one episode! People upload the gayest and dumbest TV series you can think of and get a plenty of seeds - why a legend does not get the same courtesy? SEED!
,Lothol,2008-09-09T05:24Z,"Thanx a million! =)

Its the best show ever made! :D"
,paragon9,2008-10-19T17:48Z,great upload.............many thanks!
,paragon9,2008-10-19T17:55Z,"I'd also like to add that i've watched seasons 1 and 2 by this uploader, and the quality has been great, no problems at all.......... :7)"
,voodooi,2008-11-11T06:41Z,"Very nice gesture for the xfiles fans, thank you"
,kabalizo,2008-11-30T09:50Z,"I will never tire of thanking you, oh long-named-one"
,Hirsuteluvr,2008-12-24T09:26Z,"Thanks a lot VELHINHOCEGO! These are fantastic rips... pleasure helping seed.

,Hirsuteluvr,2008-12-27T04:48Z,"Thanks again VEL!
Uploading Season 3 now at 100+, going out to party now (boxing day, Canada) but leaving S3 running day/night.

4gb up so far for S3, and I'll continue to do so as S4-S5+ completes."
,paranoidandy,2008-12-28T23:55Z,"Thank you, and jimmyfingers educate yourself."
,SincereVisions,2009-01-15T06:40Z,BEST SHOW IN THE WORLD. IM BACK FOR SEASON 3
,ravemeover,2009-02-16T05:51Z,Anyone have any idea why i'm such a slow download speed?? I upload at 100kbs and download is always around 20...??
,JulianSmith,2009-06-01T09:11Z,"Sorry, but how do the subtitles work? are they a seperate file?
haven't downloaded it yet"
,JV-j3,2010-02-27T01:08Z,Jeesus Chrost SEED you motherfuckers! speed - 5kb
,sammyboblammy,2010-04-09T00:36Z,"How is it possible that I've uploaded more then the actual amount of the files? its 8.31gb and i've uploaded 9.40gb, also my upload speed is consistently higher then my download speed. no complaint because it gets done i've got the first 2 seasons, i'm just curious. if someone could reply, thanks."
,primalclaws1974,2010-04-25T09:36Z,kinda pain in the ass using this if you don't want all the subtitles and extra shit. Took awhile to choose just the video file. Hope the quality is good!
,primalclaws1974,2010-04-25T09:38Z,"sammy, thats what they want you to do! Supposedly u should upload at least 1.5 times as much as you download to give more than u take. U can control your up and download. Right click on the file."
,supplier13,2010-05-01T21:54Z,nice work!!
,kneebutt,2010-06-07T16:24Z,Primalclaws you dumb fuck - unselect all.  It's one click.  Then pick the file you want.  It's alot quicker than coming here and having a whinge about how much of a douch you are.
,seakali,2010-06-27T10:49Z,"For those complaining about subtitles, it's simple, use VLC media player, under video, click on 'subtitles track' and disable. Easy peasy!

The quality of this DVD is fabulous, and you can download disk by disk. Another great rip Velhin, thanks! "
,MrSucubus,2010-08-21T15:14Z,"Anybody knows if there are romanian subtitles for this torent?

Stie cineva daca sint subtitrari in Romaneste pentru acest torrent?"
,PeteWsolf,2010-09-23T01:22Z,"Great torrent. My average speed is well over 100 kB/s, and damn well close to 150. I don't know why people are complaining about the quality or the subtitles. The quality is not near as good as you'd find today, true, but that would be true no matter which rip it was from; it's just not shot with as high quality, remember it's from the mid 90s, not today. Also, with the subtitles, it hasn't really done anything to me; I just download the next couple episodes as I watch each one. It's quicker, more efficient, and you can just select not to download the subtitles. Honestly, great job, and I look forward getting through this season to check out your other seasons' rips"
,davidbay,2010-11-28T23:57Z,"Your work is appreciated, Keep it up.
AUDIO/10

Thanks, Dave."
,garbagedrew,2010-12-05T04:57Z,Awesome. These are the best torrents around for the X-Files!
,Nillerz,2011-01-28T22:07Z,"Great uploads on season 1 and 2, I know that. Going in a row, you see. I will seed each one to at least a 10.0 ratio. Thank you VERY much for the upload! :D"
,KarpoofdaJulii,2011-03-13T11:08Z,"The last episode, Talitha Cumi, is missing SRT subtitles."
,xylolz,2011-04-02T19:43Z,thanks
,gujar302,2011-10-18T23:13Z,Great Quality Thanks
,candorist,2011-12-26T11:05Z,"I love the X-files. I am still  at season 1 though, but thought lets get them all. "
