This is the second video out of 13 of the Eft Ultimate Therapist series by Gary Craig.

Mount ISO with Daemon tools or Alcohol120%.
The application showing the video will then automatically start.
If not, go to your explorer and doubleclick the launcher application.
This should work.

Note that before getting the best out of these videos, it is better to have first watched the "basic course". I have not uploaded this basic course since the torrents for these "beginner" courses are already to be found elsewhere.

This being said:
Enjoy!
