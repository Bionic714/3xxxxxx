Announcing: The official release of Microsoft Flight Simulator is October 17th 2006.

is there ganna be add-ons for FSX? is FS9 going to trash after the release of FSX?"
,allen_x,2006-09-22T21:39Z,About the trash part : i don't think so.
,rrodger99,2006-09-23T00:04Z,"I didn't really like the demo & there are too many out here with too much invested in FS9 to go straight to FS X.

My system isn't all new but is by no means a slow pc, but the demo ran like crap....I hope it was just the demo & the real thing will be MUCH better."
[T],stevekasian,2006-09-23T03:42Z,"Yeah - FUCK the FSX Demo. It blows big green donkey dicks. If the release is anything remotely like the demo, I ain't at all interested. And if it's not, MS are even bigger dolts than I thought for releasing something they label a ""DEMO"" that's not even a true demonstration of the final product. Gates is a fag."
,rrodger99,2006-09-23T05:37Z,"LOL @ stevekasian

Tell us how you really feel."
,flying_nun,2006-09-23T05:48Z,stevekasian ...tut..tut
,Panodilo,2006-09-23T15:34Z,"I'm going to squeeze as much joy as I can from FS9 before switching. Like twisting one's prick a two and twenty times, greedily exracting every little drop of glowing urine. I have inversted too much time downloading goodies to just switch."
