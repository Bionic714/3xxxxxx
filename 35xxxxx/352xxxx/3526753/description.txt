If you like this, check out my blog at http://knuthulu.blogspot.com where you will find lots more music like this.

This is the ultimate CD issue of Charlie & Esdor\'s collected work between 1970-1972. Their single and their legendary mini-LP are included as well as some ultra obscure bonustracks from the same time period. 10 mindblowing tracks. Inside the lush digipak one can find a 32 page booklet with detailed biography, exclusive photos and their discography. This is filthy hippie Swedish/Norwegian folk psych with sitar & freaked out fuzzguitars by the axman Lasse Summanen! It seems that these pioneers of \"real people\" music has been missed by many. ? freakemporium.com

The 32 page booklet is in English and contains a lot of good stuff. HQ scans of artwork and booklet are included.
