,ivan2005,2007-12-20T19:04Z,"Is there a secret how to write this to the DVD+R? My Nero (ver. 8) complains about the size being too big for a disc, even after I enabled short lead-in/out. ImgBurn also complains about the same error.

Could someone help me to solve this? 

Thanks!"

Try using dvdshrink. It will compress the movie to a smaller size."
