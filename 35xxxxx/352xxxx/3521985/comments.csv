,frostbrand,2006-09-15T23:01Z,"It is being seeded. Don't fall into despair just because I had a small power outage. 10% to go, this will be up in just a few hours."
,Daww,2006-09-20T22:33Z,"its a little big for my taste, but if i can finally get all of season 2 without it stoping on 99.7% i'll be overly happy i might kiss somebody, not a guy though, maybe just an mildly attractive woman i dont know."
,Nonameee,2006-09-21T22:05Z,please seed :( i started to dowload now so if sombody do it for me i vill quickly ;)
,EinZteiN,2006-11-30T17:28Z,"*THIS IS NOT 720p*

This is ""plain"" HR (960x528).
720p = 1280x720p and is usually encoded in x264 for better results/quality!

I did download this however, and the quality is what you expect from HR: good! (but not HD)
