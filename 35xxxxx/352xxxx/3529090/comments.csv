,snakus,2006-09-25T14:53Z,Unpack it. Copy to memory card using cable (Data Transfer Mode) or card reader. Launch it. Then launch cmd.exe (On Windows) drag&drop TT6_kg_4_C4Pda.exe to windows press space after that drag&drop  tomtom\PL-CZ-SK-HU.mid press enter. Enter device id from your mobile press enter. You'll get activation code write it to smartphone. That's all.

,Mentalpen,2006-11-15T19:50Z,"Hi Everyone, The files don't work on the Nokia N80 as there is a flaw in the files. Also there are no uk maps, points of interest etc, tec.

I have done a full working version with full UK maps  which where correct as of last month. I have also uploaded the full .rar file so it's super fast download.

There are full simple instructions for the N80 on a word document but if you don't have access to word the the instructions are as bellow.

Copy and paste the following link in to your browser   http://www8.rapidupload.com/d.php?file=dl&filepath=29040 
Then just click the download file link at the top left just above the words ""Sponsored Links""

These instructions are for the nokia N80 only.

Things required
Nokia N80
USB data cable
Mini SD card with 252MB of free space


Ok so download the files and then unzip the files to where ever you want using winrar.

Now firstly move any files on your memory card to either the phone or back to the pc.

Now hit the menu key, hit tools, hit memory, options, format mem. Card, click yes to the warning (This formats the memory card), give it name if you whish when prompted or just press ok to the default name ?memory card?. Hit exit, and red disconnect button to clear all the menu screens.

Connect the data cable to the phone and pc and select data transfer on the phone. Click ok the offline mode warning. This should open a box on the pc showing the memory card and it?s contents. Press maximize so the box covers the full screen.

Now open file 1 in a small box and left click and hold it so you can drag the mouse over all the files in this folder. Now click on the middle of the selected files, so it selects them all and drag in on to be memory card box behind taking care not to drop it into another folder. This will transfer the files onto the card.

Disconnect the Data cable by clicking the safely remove hardware icon in the toolbar and following the prompts.

At this point tomtom ?MAY? install but not to worry if it doesn?t.

Now turn off the phone and then turn it on again.

Then hit menu, my own and then tomtom. Tomtom will then load, select English uk, hit yes to English uk and then continue, select if you want miles or kilometres, the time format you prefer and the voice you want.

You will now see ?No maps found!?

Again hit the red call disconnect button to quit tomtom.

Now again connect the data cable to the phone and pc and select data transfer on the phone. Click ok the offline mode warning. This time you will get a different box, DO NOT open ?run tomtom Home? but scroll down and left click to highlight ?open folder to view files? and click ok, this will open the memory card. Now open file 2 containing the folder ?GB_plus_major_roads_of_WE? and left click on it and drag onto the memory card window as above taking care not to drop it into another folder and wait for it to transfer the folder and it?s contents.
Disconnect the Data cable by clicking the safely remove hardware icon in the toolbar and following the prompts.


Now here comes the tricky part for those of you inept ones out there.

Then hit menu, my own and then tomtom. Tomtom will open and again ask you to set it up, so select English uk, hit yes to English uk and then continue, select if you want miles or kilometres, the time format you prefer and the voice you want. This time it will see you have maps but will need to activate them.

This is very, very important.

Select manual.
Now take note of your device code (each code is unique to your phone, so NO, you can?t use anyone else?s.

On the PC hit start
Run
And type cmd and hit ok (this brings up a black box)

Now drag the file 3 titled ?TT6_kg_4_C4Pda.exe? onto the black box and hit space after it, now open the folder named ?GB_plus_major_roads_of_WE? in file 2 and drag the file named ?GB_plus_major_roads_of_WE.mid? on to the black box also and hit return on the keyboard.

Enter the device code from your N80 and hit return. This gives you the unique activation code.

So then on tomtom select activ"

,S8511768,2007-06-02T11:25Z,"hi there.

i downloaded mentalpen's link for tomtom. as i have a nokia n80 running on version 4.06 blah blah.

i followed his instructions for the first file, my phone puts all 3 files on at the same time and it does not automatically install.

i really need to get tom tom on my mobile as i need it for my job. i have tried literally 10 different downloads and none of them have worked. 

can someone please help me out here? what am i doing wrong?

all the files that are for setup and to run tomtom are all .exe files and obviously .exe is executable on windows yet on a symbian phone this will not work? do i need to convert it into a different file type? or what! 

all help will be most appreciated.

thanks all.
