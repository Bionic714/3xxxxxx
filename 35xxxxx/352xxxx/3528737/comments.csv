,goojam,2008-07-14T17:36Z,"Utter trash? Have you even watched it? Or are you too afraid you might be offended? GASP! OH NO! Hellooooo! New flash: This has plenty of supporting evidence, YOU are the one who has no supporting evidence. Watch it, then maybe you might actually learn something."
,EuroView,2008-07-19T01:22Z,"Have seen and shared the film with many people.  It's about time we all start growing up and come to the realization that we are responsible for our brother.  2000 years of ugly, bloody and brutal church history has taught us nothing but hate for one another.  Remember, these are the same people who put this ""christian"" bloodthirsty George W into office ... twice.  When will we have enough of hate and war?"
,hmcook87,2008-08-02T08:37Z,"""Don't waste your time watching this trash."" Of course I would expect an honest and un-biased review from someone who actually calls themselves ""Jesus_Christ_is_my_Savior"". Kind of gives away which side of the fence you've cemented yourself on...."
,LurkerX,2008-09-29T05:17Z,"Gods are made up, kid.  Read a book NOT written by christian propagandists, like a HISTORY book."
[T],IndianChristian,2008-11-02T03:13Z,"All these comments remind me of 2 verses from the Bible.

Enter through the narrow gate; for the gate is wide and the road broad that leads to destruction, and those who enter through it are many (Matthew Chapter 7)

And even though our gospel is veiled, it is veiled for those who are perishing, in whose case Satan has blinded the minds of the unbelievers, so that they may not see the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God. (2 Corinthians 4)

It is such opinions that increase my faith in the Bible. The Bible is right after all. Satan's main aim is to deny the Christ and for that he is prepared to do anything. Even if that includes inciting Muslims to kill unbelievers by promising them imaginary virgins in heaven or slowly replacing Jesus with Mary in worship and kicking Jesus out of Catholicism. Be careful of Satan & his way. He is out to get you."
,Kodiak1953,2008-12-20T23:00Z,"If I wasn't going to download this before, I am sure going to after seeing some of ignorant comments made against it.  Thank you for helping me make up my mind."
,Nitzrokk,2009-01-03T05:52Z,"Hey IndianChristianCuntrag, since you're trolling every ""The Got Who Wasn't There"" torrent writing the same stupid fucking shit on each one, I'm going to repost a response to your comment on this torrent as well, in the hopes that you see it and jump off of a tall building or hang yourself soon after. :)

""You silly cunt, you're uploading and pirating digital material on a torrent website and you're going to PREACH to us against doing things that are natural. You fucking moralless shit, DIAFuckingF!

Stop playing god. According to your QT pi scriptures we were given free will to do as we please, not to try and stop others from doing as they please. Fuck! Off!""

Have a nice day, and I'm downloading the torrent just to spite you. "
,adamryan,2009-01-10T19:30Z,"I'm a history and philosophy student and I've studied this very thing in school. There was this old ""history of religions"" school in Germany called  religionsgeschictle schule which propagated this argument at the end of the 18th and beginning of 19th century. It got destroyed for lack of convincing evidence, but it still straggles along for some reason (probably because of its evocative claims which people love). The story goes a little like this:

1st century Jewish Palestine took A.N.E. religions and cults and essentially created the ""Christ"" via a process called ""euhemerization"" (since we know for certain that Jesus was a historical person since he's written about by ancient historians like Flavius Josephus etc). 
By attributing parallels to the historical Jesus, he later became a deified godman even though his original teachings never claimed he was divine, and that the ""Mythic savior"" patterns show us how non-historical/ non-original the early Christian faith actually is.


The problems for this theory are numerous, when you take time to study it.

1) 1st century Palestine (especially in Galilee, the area where Jesus lived and taught) was a strictly Jewish and monotheistic society. All indications from texts dating from that period, before and after, all portray a society which was typically full of Jewish peasants; Jewish peasants who clung (in some instances even to the point of death) to a worship-no-God-but Yahweh type of mentality. To the 1st century Galilean Jew, ancient pagan myths like those of Tammuz/Dumuzi, Dionysus, Adonis, Attis (if they had ever even encountered these! some areas of Galilee, like Nazareth, likely never even had social pagan influence.) were not only abhorrent to them, but were downright blasphemy in their eyes. 

In order for this theory to work, you have to cling to this improbably conspiracy theory that a group of 1st century monotheistic Jews who literally LOATHED religiously pagan myths randomly decided to deify a man- something which goes against the very nature of their monotheistic religion [Deut 6:4-9, Deut 23:19, 1 Samuel 15:29, Hosea 11:9 etc]- and not only that, but also be convinced of their little story enough to actually preach and eventually wind up being martyred for this new faith. 

At the very least, this seems extremely improbable.



2) The dating is all wrong. This actually drives the nail in the casket stronger than any other case, the dating of the texts being used. 

The paralleled myth stories about Dionysus and Osiris etc, at their core, all predate Christianity, that's true. However, the cult' texts which contain parallels to Jesus all POST-DATE the rise of the historical Jesus. Nearly all of the texts date from the middle second century, which means that Christianity had already been around for 250+/- years- if any plagiarism had occurred, it was actually the other way around: Dionysus was mimetically written in light of the historical Jesus, not Jesus in light of Dionysus.

,abandofmilk,2009-01-18T00:43Z,"Just watch the movie.

For non-believers, its something to enjoy

For believers, its a good test of faith. I recently accepted jesus christ into my life and I read in the bible that god always tests your faith. So everyone i think should watch this. 

But beside the point, it's interesting."
,grain77,2009-06-29T17:43Z,"adamryan, nice comments and the most sensible bit of writing in this list. 

Puts childish nonsense like nitzrokk's in its place!"
