Not quite as coloful as the web site says, which in its own way is a good thing because I didn't like Bowling for Columbine or Supersize Me.

This is a film everyone should see, at least to add a little perspective to something that is much more important than gun laws or waist sizes.

In this provocative, critically acclaimed documentary, you will discover:

    * The early founders of Christianity seem wholly unaware of the idea of a human Jesus

    * The Jesus of the Gospels bears a striking resemblance to other ancient heroes and the figureheads of pagan savior cults

    * Contemporary Christians are largely ignorant of the origins of their religion

    * Fundamentalism is as strong today as it ever has been, with an alarming 44% of Americans believing Jesus will return to earth in their lifetimes

    * And God simply isn't there 

Dazzling motion graphics and a sweeping soundtrack propel this uncompromising and taboo-shattering documentary that Newsweek says "irreverently lays out the case that Jesus Christ never existed."

The God Who Wasn't There includes provocative interviews with:

    * Sam Harris, PEN Award-winning author of The End of Faith

    * Robert M. Price, Jesus Seminar fellow and author of The Incredible Shrinking Son of Man

    * Alan Dundes, Professor of Folklore at the University of California at Berkeley

    * Richard Carrier, historian and author of Sense and Goodness Without God
