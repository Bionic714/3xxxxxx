When i click on the green letters here that says DOWNLOAD TORRENT. a box comes up then another flashes ( the one that actually downloads the torrent link to your desktop ) it flashes then goes away.. and it auto starts downloading . What i need is to figure out where that setting is. so i can just save torrent starter on my desktop so i dont have to search in here everytime i want to seed it :) 

thanks in advance for your help :)

    **************************NOTE**************************

    Since the Piratebay staff doesn?t care for their VIP uploaders, then aXXo decided not to use TPB and he deleted his own torrents.

    aXXo was constantly exposed to assaults and harassments from possible members of MPAA. Their strategy was to harass aXXo by posting absurd and accusing comments on aXXo?s torrents.

    The latest assault incident was especially noticed on aXXo?s last torrent ?The Simpsons?.
    Hunter1980 and aXXo were involved in direct argue with possible members from MPAA.

    Unfortunately, this strategy was a success. The strategy was based on rumors and the intention was to spread rumors and all this have had a negative side effects on naive people ( downloaders ).

    Since PirateBay did not take any action towards ?Organized attacks?, aXXo decided to delete his torrent on TPB. aXXo is continuing posting his torrents on mininova or other torrent sites since they care for their VIP uploaders.

You provide an excellent service to many, many people, and if there's few whiners (as there will ALWAYS be), then so what!?
I'm really not into all this bitch-slapping.

TPB is lazy ! And stupid too !

About the Simpson rip I tried both DoNE and yours and you have the better one. Better image, better sound, better all around. In fact I'm really amazed how mediocre is the DoNE rip considering the fact that this is a 87 min 2D animation movie. I was hoping you do a proper one and you did!  For those who want to convince for themselves it's not so hard to download both and compare, I do that frequently  and aXXo usually comes on top.

To conclude, thanks for all the effort you put in and be sure that many of us will continue to download and seed your torrents. Take care man, last who leaves the ""building"" please turn off the light :))
