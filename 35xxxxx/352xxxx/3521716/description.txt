Mini Plot:

Director David Lynch has gone to Dumbland. The cult director, best known for the 1986 film Blue Velvet, the 1990 TV series Twin Peaks and last year's The Straight Story, now spends his days in front of a home computer, making animated shorts for Shockwave.com using software called Flash.

Describing Dumbland as a weekly offering of "stupid, coarse humor," Lynch sits at his Apple iMac, drawing images with his mouse, animating them, providing the voices, composing and performing the background music. All by himself.

"I like this (Flash) technology, and I like the company," says Lynch, 54. "They're the kind of people who will help define what the Internet is. It's modern thinking and the right way to go."
