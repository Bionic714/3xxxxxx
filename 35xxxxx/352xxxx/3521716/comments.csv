[T],sickboy88,2007-02-08T17:45Z,"Since this is the last torrent that I uploaded, I am going to add a comment to it, for everyone to read:  

I don't take part in file-sharing any longer.  Not only that, I don't upload movies to usenet either.  I don't have any of my stuff laying around, it was all taken from me last year when my house was robbed while I was away.  I do not wish to break the law anymore - yet I encourage everyone else to continue to do so as long as it brings you joy.  This tracker was the only one that I ever liked, and I hope it lasts until the technology known as ""bittorrent"" is replaced by something better.  If anyone needs help with encoding, or something like that, feel free to email me...I've had the same email address for 9 years.  I hope everyone continues to have fun, and can enjoy this hobby until it is no longer possible to do so.  Thus being said, my interests in life have changed...I now find joy by being in the forrest, and living off of the flesh of animals I have taken while hunting and fishing.  I don't even have a phone anymore, and if I did, I wouldn't answer it...technology has made me sick.  Have fun...be safe.  8FEB07"

,greasetrap,2007-12-29T20:59Z,"I can't figure out this how to PM anybody, so I thought that I might as well comment on here and see if you can get back to me.  I've been downloading torrents for a while and always try to seed my fair share, but I have no idea how to rip a DVD and upload it as a torrent file, any ideas or websites with a tutorial that you could show me would be great.  Thanks for all the great uploads, I appreciate the films."
,greasetrap,2007-12-29T21:01Z,"Fuck.  I just read your comment, thanks again for all of the great films."
,ergot,2008-04-23T17:24Z,"sickboy88 always had the best torrent comments.  Too bad he dropped off the face of the earth.  A lot of his torrents are dead now so a lot of his best comments aren't being seen.  Like this shit for example:
http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3319181/Heathers_(xvid102-sickboy88)_avi

Fucking awesome.  :)"

,E.P.I.C.,2008-09-03T15:14Z,"@artmike89::
well m8 first of all click the ''download this torrent'' and then at the screen that appears press ok.You have saved the torrent now.After that press at the icon of the torrent that should be at your desktop(basically you choose where to save the torrent).Your torrent dowloader(bitcomet etc.) will automatically open the page to download this torrent.Just choose where to save it and wait for the download to enjoy the film!!"
