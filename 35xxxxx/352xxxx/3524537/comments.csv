""Yo! Its goin cool for the doctor I got my shiat down and the birds r hangin off my cok!

I was hangin out by the shops with my bros and this hot biatch parks her car and goes into a shop. My wussy mates are like ""wow, she is hot but I cant talk to her shes too hot"". I say ""Yo, watch the doctor show you how its done"" and I go and sit on the front of her car with a can of beer.

She comes back and is like ""what you doing on my car?"" and I do some teasin on her and say she looks too dumb to drive. She says she aint dumb so I say ""yo must be drunk then so you aint driving this car!""

She starts smiling and give me eye contact so I touch her and say ""let me drive you somewhere quiet"". She gives me her keys and I drive and she keeps trying to feel my balls while I'm driving and I tell her to hold back cos shes gonna get some when we stop. I get to this park and this bloke says its closed and we cant go in, so I ram through the gate and the bloke runs off screaming.

Me and this girl start making out and have sex! She said I am the best she ever had and I say ""yeah I know but I aint got started yet"" and but the cops pull up and say they need to talk to me cos I'm trespasing and caused damage tot he gate. I tell them I'm busy and they must wait. And I start bumming this bird right in front of them.

It took 4 of them to pull me off and put me in handcuffs and they take me to jail. I got out this morning and they let me off with a fine."""
