(another) imdb link :) http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0384680

from imdb:
A Chicago weather man (Cage), separated from his wife and children, debates whether professional and personal success are mutually exclusive.

sounds worth watching & buying imo."

The film is well worth a watch, I really enjoyed it!"
