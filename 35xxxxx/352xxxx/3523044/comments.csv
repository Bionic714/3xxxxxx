,allah2006,2007-06-10T06:06Z,"DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS FILE, IT WILL STOP AT 99.99%...

GO HERE INSTEAD: http://www.mybittorrent.com/info/312220/files/

All you need to download is file .073 and overwrite what you already have.

thepiratebay.org is by far the most trustworthy torrent site however, so please upload at least x2, and share the things you get... Torrents only works when people are sharing at x2 or more...

If someone cannot get the file, send me a message, and I can FTP it to you, I am not going to open my server ports...
