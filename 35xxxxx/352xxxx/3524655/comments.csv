Why Quran is not from God:

Muhammad produced no miracles and when pressed he claimed that his miracle is the Quran. Yet a cursory look at the Quran reveals that this book is full of errors. Quran is replete with scientific heresies, historic blunders, mathematical mistakes, logical absurdities, grammatical errors and ethical fallacies. It is badly compiled and it contradicts itself. There is nothing intelligent in this book let alone miraculous. Muhammad challenged people to produce a ?Surah like it? or find an error therein, yet Muslims would kill anyone who dares to criticize it. In such a climate of hypocrisy and violence truth is the first casualty.


what a bankruped moron you are!think idiot!think!"

Heard, heard! This man speaks the truth. You would have to be quite unintelligent as well to convert to Islam.

Only death, corruption and hatred can come from that religion.

Zorianarki, you should learn to use proper grammar and punctuation, moreover, spelling is not your strongest side either. So, before you criticise someone else, you should learn to look yourself in the mirror. 

Islam is a religion for unintelligent immature adults that still allow themselves to act like violent teenagers."

,w000ter,2006-09-17T09:31Z,"some ideologies are more defective than others. islam is the most defective of the lot by far.  it is a death cult, a religion of oppression.  all this ""rage"" is because their ideology is supremacist, just like the kkk."
,w000ter,2006-09-17T09:32Z,islam is incompatible with the universal declaration of human rights.  just look into it. there is no freedom of conscience in islam.

,Bendico,2006-10-06T21:45Z,"If there is a true religion, just one, it would definitely be Judaism since it founded the other Abrahamic religions and is most concentrated towards God.

Judaism does not have its focus on Jesus or Muhammad.

They do not idolise, which is quite good in my opinion since the thought of one God, and only one God (AND NO GOD DAMN FINAL MESSENGER !!)

Muhammad was a stupid goddamn paedophile.

Then again I do not believe in anything... but since they all sprung out from Judaism I guess it does make it more ""right""."
,vicki_urs,2006-11-18T13:00Z,"Muhammad P.B.U.H is the last messenger of GOD and The Holy Quran is his miracle, a book from God and tht y the context of Holy Quran is same as before 1400 years ago and will remain same until the day of judment....beside other books like Bible, which has many version available today

and Islam is not only a true religion, but also a political system that governs the legal, economic and social imperatives of the state according to interpretations of Islamic Law."
,steve112,2006-11-28T20:30Z,"omg a bunch of idiots here too!!!
what is this nonsens about islam being a religion of hatred and death??? people before you write or even THINK....do some real research before relying on MEDIA and those bullshit news you watch every day! goddamn, if there is some hatred it is YOU people, hahaha your full of it!

and BENDICO, what do you really know about judaism you stupid ignorent !""##!%!, did you forget about how Jews are Gods ""chosen people"" and how the rest of us are a bunch of Goja`?? (even said in american pie) OMG people, if someone with a mind would argue with u, you would fall down and collapse!!!"
,maher088,2006-12-21T02:33Z,"Islam is a great religion. I am a recent convert. Islam is the truth, quran is  the only holy book that was never been altered. Go read quran translation and read the words of GOD. I have never been happier than now. You will not lose anything, take a look at this great religion and decide."

The creator of heaven, earth, and all in between, before Who we shall all stand to be judged some day whether you believe in Him or not!

,rockstar11998,2008-04-07T17:06Z,"CarlWilfilUranus - sure tell them there are many paths to God.  That is what Satan wants people to say.  That would make it easy for anyone of any faith to get into heaven.  Well, sorry to burst your bubble, but God has designated that only one path will lead you to Him.  Jesus was the Gate - why else would all of the prophets foretell of His coming.  It must have been more important to do what He told us to do than to accept any old religion that seems to be good enough.  God is bound by laws and so he expects us to be as well.  If we don't have a clear picture of the correct laws he wants us to abide by then we will be lost and won't be where we expect we should be after this life.  You need to do a lot more praying and searching instead of listening to the pleasing words Satan has given you to say 'All is well in Zion'.  Satan knows that he can use religion to cause contention amongst God's children.  That's why there are so many different religions today.  Some don't get involved with the struggle much - Hinduism and Buddhism but that is because they are so far off the path its not funny."
,CarlWilfilUranus,2008-05-18T00:46Z,"rockstar11998: Thanks for your response, and thanks for sparing us with blasphemous filth one commonly comes across in such responses from my former Christian brethren. Satan declared himself as our ?Open Enemy?. But he has no power. He?s called ?The Whisperer?; he leads us astray. We give him power when we do his bidding. All Power is God?s. I?ve been doing some reading lately, apart from theology I studied in a Maltese seminary eons ago. GOING BY YOUR OWN ?LITMUS TEST?, check out Deuteronomy 18:18: ?I will raise them up a Prophet from among their brethren, like unto thee, and I will put my words in his mouth; and he shall speak unto them all that I shall command him."" This does NOT refer to Jesus Christ or John the Baptist but it is an explicit prophecy about the Holy Prophet MUHUMMED!"" Also check out the warning: ?: ""AND IT SHALL COME TO PASS, "" ""THAT WHOSOEVER WILL NOT HEARKEN UNTO MY WORDS WHICH HE SHALL SPEAK IN MY NAME, I WILL REQUIRE IT OF HIM.? (in the Catholic Bible the ending words are - ""I will be the revenger"", I will take vengeance from him - I will take revenge!). The coming of Muhammed is also prophesized in the Hindu Holy Books but, alas, ?they cannot see the wood from the trees?! It?s hard to break away from our ?comfort zone?, what we grew up believing in ? even when truth stars us smack in the face! Who knows, you might have better luck.

PEACE!"
,rockstar11998,2008-06-29T18:24Z,"CarlWilfilUranus - aka Korihor aka Antichrist - I have yet another beef with your misinformed comments.  Here is what you said - 'Satan declared himself as our ?Open Enemy?. But he has no power.'  Pardon me but you are not even close with this one.  Satan has lots and lots of power.  Didn't you see Hitler take over most of Europe - a man empowered by Satan.  Satan can shake the earth, Satan can pose as an Angel of light, Satan can possess bodies (animals and human), he can heal and restore peoples bodies, Satan can see into the future and make predictions, and he has control over 1/3 of the hosts of heaven.  I can go on and on.  Now that it's clear he has power lets talk about what powers he doesn't have.  He will never have a body (so he will never become glorified), or the Priesthood, he has no power over those who choose to follow righteousness, he must always depart if we command him to in the name of Jesus Christ, he is blocked from entering dedicated buildings, and he must always lie.  The biggest lie Satan wants you and others to hear is that he doesn't exist or that he doesn't have any power.  So by you saying he doesn't have power you are supporting him.  If there is no Satan there is no sin. If there is no sin then we have no righteousness either, then there is no good or bad and we have a pointless and meaningless life.  But if Satan does have power and does exist the opposite is true.  We have great potential to become like God.  There is evil and therefore there is good.  There is sin so we need Jesus Christ in order to repent.  We can become glorified and receive the same glory as Jesus Christ and inherit the same kingdom he has inherited.
Now about this comment - 'check out Deuteronomy 18:18: ?I will raise them up a Prophet from among their brethren, like unto thee, and I will put my words in his mouth; and he shall speak unto them all that I shall command him."" This does NOT refer to Jesus Christ or John the Baptist but it is an explicit prophecy about the Holy Prophet MUHUMMED!"" This chapter is specifically about Jesus Christ. Earlier it states that the prophet will be just like Moses.  Moses was a model of Jesus Christ because he was a savior to his people by bringing them out of bondage. Just like Jesus Christ can relieve us from the bondage of sin.  There are many other parallels but I think that will suffice.  Once again you try to belittle the significance of Jesus Christ.  What about the Law of Moses - who or what were all of the rituals and performances meant to prepare the Jews for.  A savior, a perfect savior without spot or blemish, a lamb of God, someone who would willingly obey and lay down his life (not slaughter innocent people like Muhammad).  There is so much symbolism in the Law of Moses that to deny Christ as the Savior is to deny that the Sun shines.
Trying to justify Muhammad with Hindu text is ridiculous.  Satan was the author of that religion too.  Of course he would back up his own pawn in other text.  No where in the Bible does it predict that Muhammad would be anything but a false prophet.  Actually later on in the New Testament Jesus Christ pointed out that there would be many false prophets after his coming - along came Muhammad as foretold.
I really like this statement of yours - 'they cannot see the wood from the trees?'  Truer words were never spoken.  The Jews had the law of Moses to show them who the savior would be when he came.  But the leaders were so corrupt and evil that they didn't recognize it or want to belief it because then they would lose their position and power.  You are much the same.  You cannot see  all of facts and truth about Christ because you are too full of yourself and corrupt.  Your speech alone gives you away.  All the hate and perverted speech you gave on another topic tells us clearly you're on the side of Satan (or Islam which is of Satan - take your pick).  I wish you PEACE as well but you won't find it in Islam.  Islam has declared war on the whole world so peace is not in the future.  The only peace you or I will find is in acc"
