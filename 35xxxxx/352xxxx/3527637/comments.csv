,brasko,2006-09-22T11:20Z,For which country?
,sebeg,2006-09-22T11:50Z,"Thanks, works perfectly... country of Gaim is incuded (wherever that is)."
,dudevski,2006-09-22T16:42Z,"i am trying to install it on Yreo 650 with no luck so far. I copied files to SD card through card reader, then inserted in Treo and it did automatically start. Now after that I have trouble. I copied North America maps to the directory and it recognizes that maps are there but I have trouble passing activation code.

Readme file said to copy from crack to install directory and it will take any code, but I can't figure it out. I copied to Palm and to root of SD the cracked file still nothing. The program works, but activation is the problem for me. Hopefully somebody can help, thanx."
,dudevski,2006-09-22T16:56Z,"mhe: Yes I did delete the Start.exe from the root of SD and deleted start from PALM and replced both with tomtom navigator.exe from crack. Myabe I gotta use the hotsync or somth. I am using card reader to delet, copy etc files on SD. I enter Manual activation and 12345, it's not working. There is prolly someth simple I am missing here."
,dudevski,2006-09-22T17:08Z,"mhe: I understand now. I erased everything from the card and just started from the begining. It did what happened before. Treo did not really give me a choice where to install it, it just showed tomtom screen after I inserted the card and it went straight to map activation. Maybe I should use Quickinstall or somth."
,Furio65,2006-09-22T23:03Z,Try activating it with the Guam map first. Then switch to the map you want.

,Furio65,2006-10-01T22:55Z,"After some roadtesting I discovered the following: TomTom creates a file ""traffic"" in the used map. I don't know if this only happens if you use the Plus services though, but what I do know is that after a while TomTom suddenly fails to start when clicking the .exe Removing the ""traffic"" file (mind you, there are two. Remove the one with the most recent date) and TomTom works again. Hopefully this isue will be solved in a newer version or crack. For the rest: works just fine"
,michaeljv,2006-10-02T05:04Z,"try this, worked on my 2495b ipaq.

Do a Hardreset
instal .cab tt6
do not reboot
go to explorer
tap windows
go to menu
show all files
search for file BTCOREIF end delete it
reboot and install the crack
you can do with HP 2790 and Asus a636 mypal
you got sound again "
