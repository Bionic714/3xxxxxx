[T],BeastG,2006-09-28T17:32Z,Thanks for the great upload VELHINHOCEGO!! :D
,The|Dude,2006-10-08T13:57Z,"great upload man, I'm done with season 1,2,3 tomorrow perhaps and will continue seeding for at least a week or so. One question: swedish subs? anyone know? "
,screenslave,2007-01-13T11:40Z,"Great torrent, but the picture isn't very sharp - feels like a VHS-rip. "
,manteiga,2007-03-13T08:32Z,"Cara, me tira uma duvida, uma vez eu comecei a baixar um release parecido com esse só que o video já tinha uma legenda em ingles embutida no video. Isso não me interessa, dai eu te pergunto, teu release é video + legenda independente ou tem alguma legenda embutida no video fora os arquivos de legenda já presentes no torrent???"
,trollwize,2007-03-30T23:08Z,"Please put some seed guys. Gettin real slow. Open up your pipes to full.


Thank you"
,Nathan_,2007-05-18T23:20Z,These seasons don't fit on DVD-R DLs... Even just the video files by about 20 MB. :(
,Slakpad,2007-06-11T17:47Z,"download is very slow, though there are quite a lot of seeders. what's going on?"
,anotherdomingo,2007-06-19T04:20Z,"Does anyone else get an error that reads:  ""disk read error - Data error (ccle redundancy check) read fails"" ?????

I started getting it around 80% through the file and it's annoying because it stopped the download..."
,Slakpad,2007-06-22T15:08Z,"more people need to seed when finnished, to few seeders for this many leechers! "
,fasterthanhell,2007-08-31T19:40Z,"3 different subs' Thats the way you release avi files nice one dude, great!!!!"
,mr_poo,2007-09-03T22:41Z,"if you download a torrent and not seed back then you are GAY!!!

,theBruce,2007-12-14T12:22Z,Thanks a lot! This is more nineties than grunge!
,Torrent245,2007-12-15T19:39Z,"Hey, X-files. This was one of those popular shows I wasn't able to watch as a 'kid'."
,Torrent245,2008-01-06T02:16Z,"Bah, I was almost complete, then my torrent screwed up! I have to start all over! I've been waiting all month for it to work too."
,Erebus99,2008-02-03T20:00Z,Great Torrent. I'll be seeding this one for a long time.

,sominus,2008-04-26T00:51Z,"I think these are the best quality rips we can get on the net. subs and subpack included... It's amazing.
Wish this could be seeded for years. 
May be the upcoming movie will bring this epic series to new people."
,badwx25,2008-04-28T02:10Z,Anybody know of a good program to burn these to dvds. Everyone program I try won't work.
,silentnoise,2008-06-05T20:32Z,"What's a good way to watch it?
By ""order aired"" or by ""episode number"""
,thechameleon86,2008-06-08T07:28Z,Great quality. Perfect for burning to DVD. Torrent even includes a scanned image of the artwork on each disk.  Thank you so much!
,VPf2,2008-06-13T11:15Z,"Quote: What's a good way to watch it?
By ""order aired"" or by ""episode number"" 

Well it's hard to tell, I watched by episode number. I guess the air time is different in certain countries."
,s1r1,2008-06-29T13:37Z,"This is the best release out there, in my mind. Thank you for the excellent work."
,LtFransky,2008-08-01T16:54Z,Great upload.  How do I get rid of the subtitles when I'm watching in WMP?
,LtFransky,2008-08-01T16:56Z,"Oops, forget it.  I figured it out."
,greymann,2008-08-08T04:08Z,Why the lying bastard?  It says 184/95 ratio on the webpage when it's actually 159/1946.  Thanks.
,YellowVestedZmbe,2008-08-11T01:18Z,"VELHINHOCEGO

,turboman8,2008-08-13T22:53Z,more seeders please right now its telling me its gonna take 3 days to complete downloading

,RaffeAlexander,2008-10-15T22:44Z,Anyone who uses Bit Tornado here? im at 90% but i will seed till ive seeded 100gb but the thing is that my upload speed is 170 and my download is 50 and im connected to 7 seeders so why cant more ppl seed a little more instead off having such a hurry with downloadig? Im just trying to be nice:P 
,shaneSAYSchoke,2008-11-20T06:08Z,"Awesome seed! I love these shows. When I downloaded them, however, I only selected the AVI files in Utorrent, so I wont be able to seed everything else."
,SincereVisionz,2008-11-21T12:53Z,Forget the circus THIS is the greatest show on earth. Every episode is perfect in HQ. I will be on and off seeding for my X-ies out there. The truth is out there lol
,kabalizo,2008-11-30T09:44Z,"thanks, oh unpronouncable-named uploader."

,macmad14,2009-01-18T17:40Z,"Excellent torrent, but does any1 kno how to burn this to a dvd?"
,varilthes,2009-01-28T20:43Z,why does it insist on dowloading the subs? i use utorrent and told it not to download any of the extra bs beside the avi's and its downloading alot of that crap anyway? Why? 
,LadyAbagail,2009-03-11T09:00Z,"Because torrents are downloaded in blocks of data that do not end on the logical beginning or ending of specific files.  Part or all of the adjoining files may also be retrieved even if they aren't selected to dl, as they reside in the the same first or last block as the files you have selected to download."
,exu666,2009-03-27T20:06Z,"Ola velho amigo,
Sua missao esta completa e seu legado persevera! Ainda bem, pois mais uma vez tirarei proveito do seu legado, ja que mudei de pais e achei muto arriscado levar meus DVDs comigo ;)

entao, mais uma vez muitissimo grato!!!"
,Smuggles,2009-07-28T22:43Z,thanks for this :)
,jewfroHH,2009-08-13T20:50Z,"It sucks being a noob...but I was hoping someone could help me out. The 1st episode streams perfectly to my PS3 but when I stream/play the 2nd there's no sound! I have tried using Vuze and Tversity and even burning it onto a disc but there's never sound, unless I play it on my computer of course (I'm using ffdshow). Just thought it odd the pilot would have sound but no others. Any ideas?

Also, thank you SOOOO much for the up. I will seed through Hanukkah :)"
,Symn,2009-11-30T12:42Z,why do you include subtitle files whilst the episode are already subtitled within the files in a heinously big font that uses half the screen?
,Maul99,2009-12-20T02:31Z,"Thank you so much for this. I remember the X-files from my upbringning. That spooky sound in the beginning of every episode scared me. Science fiction in it's best. You deserve all my respect, I'll seed like a bitch :)"
,Zelda_PH,2010-01-31T13:04Z,Thank you for great upload!
,MrSucubus,2010-08-21T15:13Z,"Anybody knows if there are romanian subtitles for this torent?

Stie cineva daca sint subtitrari in Romaneste pentru acest torrent?"
,infid3l,2010-12-02T11:03Z,Now it is downloading very well in my opinion! ;) Thanks for the classic hit series. And good quality too.
,ajroberts,2011-01-15T04:28Z,I keep getting an ERROR-CORRUPT TORRENT.  Any way to fix this?
,_kn0wledge_,2011-04-02T22:12Z,"I am having the same problem ""Error - corrupt"""

,discmeister,2011-04-23T12:47Z,"Just a quick note to say thanks, VELHINHOCEGO. I've been struggling to rip my own box set - at least two faulty discs - so this is a quick, and effective, fix. Again, thanks for your efforts."
,mountain_6969uk,2011-05-18T01:55Z,"can anyone give me some advice? ive stuck this onto my external harddrive for viewing through my PS3, the pilot worked fine, but there is no audio for all the rest. any help would be appreciated. thanks."
,fretfree,2011-06-18T12:43Z,@mountain_6969uk I have the same problem with this torrent.
