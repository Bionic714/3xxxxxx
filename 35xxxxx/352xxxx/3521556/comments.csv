,datagutten,2006-09-10T22:34Z,"I try to seed as much as i can, but sometimes i have problems with my computer."
,datagutten,2006-09-11T15:58Z,"Anyone who finish downloading this, please help me seed."
,Thepieman,2006-09-12T06:29Z,"The longer it takes the higher the amount of people that will pass 1:1 ratio. Im already at 3.4:1 and its not even done yet. Try to finish it so the people with 1:1 auto won't stop seeding.

I will keep seeding for a while after you finish. Plz finish it though"
,Thepieman,2006-09-13T01:23Z,"Anyone else having install problems? Keeps looking for files on disk 2 for me.

,charlesb1,2006-09-13T23:03Z,"I have trouble burning cd 2, the files are all wrong for windows to read, and why all those repeating RAR ISO files, since they are all the same size and content.
It took 22 hr to download this so far it seem a waste of time unless someone prove me wrong!"
,Thepieman,2006-09-14T02:18Z,Yeah you have to keep clicking on browse to find the files properly otherwise it won't find everything. I don't know why this wasn't done right. It was a fucking waste of time. Its supposed to be a Corp. copy but it still fails validation.
