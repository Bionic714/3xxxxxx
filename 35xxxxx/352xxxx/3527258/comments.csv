,ticktock_man,2006-09-30T22:54Z,"awesome movie. this shows that even a relatively simple plot (you could summarize it in one sentence) can make for an extremely entertaining movie if it has top-notch acting.

theres no special effects, no T&A, no action scenes, just a pure dialogue movie (like Reservoir Dogs). the acting is fucking incredible, and will keep you riveted till the end. 9/10"

This movie is quite excellent."

,tikkig0d,2009-06-21T01:24Z,most movies that come in .rar files u extract the #1 file and it automatically extracts the rest.if after that if u still cant watch it i suggest that you d/l a codec or if that is 2 hard for u to understand just get a free dvd player I.E AVS
