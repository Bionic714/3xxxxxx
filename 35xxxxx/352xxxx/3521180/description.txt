        Plot

A horrific plane crash leaves 48 passengers alive, and stranded on a remote          island in the South Pacific. The survivors include doctor Jack, now freed           prisoner Kate, one hit wonder rock star Charlie, Iraqi military vet Sayid,           and a mysterious man named Locke. For a while their goal is simple survival,           but they soon realize that it was far more than mere chance that brought them           together, and each of them has a purpose that will help them unlock the island's           secrets.
