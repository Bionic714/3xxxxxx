the rest (meaning ALL the discs) will come, uploads will be slow at first, then uncap one by one. . .	
I will not keep the swarm alive after each disc is completely uploaded, I need to seed the others so pls seed to 1:1 - if you do, everyone will get a copy!
Please share to as many trackers as you can!	"
