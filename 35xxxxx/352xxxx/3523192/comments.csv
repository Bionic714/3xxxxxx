,decadent_ru,2008-05-27T22:41Z,"hello, panpa, thank you very much for this torrent, but could you answer my question, please:
Does this DVD (and the other DVDs of Lost season 2) have an audio commentary track ? This is very important to me, since I do own DVDs of Lost, but without the commentary tracks (which is very disappointing).
Being a fan of the series, I would love to listen to what the producers and the actors have to say about the ""making-of"" process...The commentary track I'm talking about should be included in the ""special features"" set. "
,miss_fortune,2008-07-13T19:46Z,"I cant vouch for these, but for those looking for all episodes, here are the links (took me a while!)  Hope it helps.  Im DLing DVD 5 at the mo...will post the Quality :)
