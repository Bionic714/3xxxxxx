ZZTop  "XXX" reseed/correction

ZZTop  "XXX" .... when someone played me a track off this I thought it was great, pretty off the wall and I couldn't work out who it was at all.  This isn't risque rock/pop with the band in cool shades, hot-rod and hot rock chicks.  
It's strange stuff IMO, but an intereting diversion that still rocks with a hint of their trademark country sway. 
I like nearly everything on here, but was delighted with Dusty's down and dirty version of Elvis's Teddy Bear.
There isn't a trace of Presleys cutie-pie dollness left in this - these guys ripped the stuffing out of the cutie-doll, banged her brainless and left her in the gutter squawking. 
It's low and sleazy and I loved it to bits.
