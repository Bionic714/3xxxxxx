,ImBored454,2006-12-23T00:55Z,"Thanks for the seed.  Season 3 is NOT OVER!  Its split in half over the winter like the sopranos or something.  Do a quick search.  Theres another ~10 episodes starting mid febuary i think.  Also, I believe season 4 has been confirmed too.  So don't worry, there's a bunch more Entourage on the way.  Show your support and buy seasons one and two (and three when it comes out)!! We don't want Entourage going off the air!"
