[T],Knaster,2006-12-08T23:37Z,"Hey cool man, this is pure nostalgia! Although it's a pain when it's in the wrong category don't beat urself up about it this time, if you search audio and rush you'll see it anyway! And i guess you'll post it right next time as this is music in the ""music "" section!

It would have been worse if it where porn posted in the wrong category, i don't think anyone like that, we have to think about the children ;)! Keep on rockin!"
