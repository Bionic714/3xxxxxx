,obiii,2006-09-17T09:34Z,THIS DOES NOT WORK... IT SAYS IT IS DAMAGE OR DIRTY OR SOMETHING.. DONT DOWNLOAD ITS JUST CRAP!!!
,Yobo1987,2006-09-17T10:04Z,I have tried to go around the problem and it went well. Copy the files on your drive to the desktope in a map. But after that when i installed it it dosent work. When i klic to start its just loads and nothing happens. The computer locks down.

,Snowstorm,2008-02-24T12:28Z,"Hi all! 
Thanks for the torrent Sunblock...
anyway I just wanted to say that for everyone that have played any of Max Payne games, this is a f***ing copy - and it's a bad one to! the enemy has 1000 times more health than you and are sometimes impossible to kill... anyway just wanted to share my thoughts about the game. 
Keep up the good work everyone. "
