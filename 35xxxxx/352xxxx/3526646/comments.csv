,Mr_Fear,2006-09-20T03:31Z,"If anyone is interested, i've got the orinal TOS too and am thinking about starting seeding these when TNG is finished, but only if anyone wan't em..."
,Muhaja,2006-09-20T07:59Z,"I'm VERY interested in TOS , mr_Fear. I would like it if you uploaded them after TNG. :)"
[V],firbie,2006-09-20T12:16Z,"Oh wonderful!, I have some TOS and a lot which have stopped at 90%. So you will make me so happy!!"
,doc99,2006-09-20T15:44Z,"yes yes seed tos please
Mr. Fear"
,Mr_Fear,2006-09-20T17:06Z,"Ok, you will get your TOS, so i found someone that are willing to seed TOS for me, so i'm going to start seeding from disc 1 tommorrow. 
But be patient, it's only an 512kb/s connection 8-15 and 1024kb/s 15-8 (GMT +1)."
,acomes,2006-09-20T20:52Z,"Would be possible to release TNG sesaon 6 in parallel with season 1 and season 7 in parallel with season 2?
Thanks."
,Mr_Fear,2006-09-20T21:32Z,"Sorry, that's not possible, cause is that i only get the originals as 2 discs every week, so it's not gonna change..."
,MagnumOne,2006-09-23T14:45Z,Could you please release the next discs in Dual layer (DVD9)? That way the quality would be preserved to 100%.
,Haldor_D,2006-09-24T00:22Z,"Dual Layer? I prefer them as they are - 4.35 GB. And i hope they stay that way. You want 100% quality? Buy them. Full-sized DVDs would mean longer download times, more expansive discs to burn on and a harder time to get people to stay and seed. Besides... 4.35 GBs times 45-50 discs is a whole lot less than full-sized discs."
,Mr_Fear,2006-09-24T08:55Z,"I will continue releasing these as DVD5, because:
- Half the size (keeping seeders)
- Quality isn't that bad (65% of original)
- Prize for DVD5 media is 27 times cheaper than DVD9
- Going to take to long to seed (4-5 days)

So no matter what, i'll keep these releases as DVD5 and i have no intention of starting releases as DVD9 at a later time.

But for those interested in DVD9 releases, buy or rent em online and release em yourself."
,ipeniemela,2006-09-25T05:41Z,Please upload disc four already...anxiously waiting for it...
,Mr_Fear,2006-09-25T15:15Z,"Ok, figured out the trouble reading this next DVD, so i will relese it tomorrow afternoon."
,eldard,2007-03-18T11:32Z,Forget this. Go here for 90% quality: http://thepiratebay.org/search/star%20trek%20the%20next%20generation/0/0/0
,knie,2008-05-10T15:21Z,"Please seed someone, stuck at 81%
Thanks!"
