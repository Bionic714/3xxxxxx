This torrent contains the keynote given by Richard Stallman at Granada, April 23rd 2005.

The keynote is given in Spanish, with no subtitles

The video material is freely distributable under Free Software Foundations General Public License.

The torrent contains 2 AVI video files, 973 MB total.

Transcript & subtitles?

I am seeding these already publicly available files, in the hope, that someone proficient in Spanish will be so kind and willing to transcribe and produce subtitles for this material.

Such a contribution would be most welcome.
