,Sinnersfury,2006-09-18T08:16Z,"For all of you that has a desire to play a VERY different character, and immerse yourself in a bizarre world, this is for you.

This is the game that fans of RPG and Adventure still talk about, some 10ish years after it's release, the characters that can join you include a chattering flying skull, a fire obsessed *burning* wizard, a cleric from Hell (yes, that's right), a walking set of armor and a mad robotlike archer. Other characters exist too ^^

The plot is simple: regain your memory and mortality(!). And in so doing make deals with the undead, meet witches and fallen angels and destroy a demon or two. Rely on charms, intelligence, wisdom, cunning or brute strength, your choice^^

Clearly recommended by lots and lots of dedicated players, many who (like me) still have the original and play it often, for the hilarious comments and very unusual style... A must if you ever want to know what a GREAT game should be like!^^"
,kitara,2006-09-18T08:27Z,"This is not point if you not seed, Why you not seed ??????"
,Sinnersfury,2006-09-18T12:19Z,"Don't forget, the number of seeders/leechers doesn't always update that fast, might be hours before any update. And if he's uploading, don't be in a rush, you'll get it soon enough^^"
,TheWhig,2006-09-18T12:19Z,"For some reason I'm seeding exceptionally poorly. It might be well worth abandoning this torrent at this point.

I have no idea why this should be the case, and am truly sorry about it!

I'll stay on for a while in case my connection gets any better, but it's looking pretty bleak at this point. Again, I'm really, really sorry about this, and hope the opportunity arises soon for you guys to try this game out. It really is my favourite game of all time, and I just wanted to share that with you.

Sorry."
,TheWhig,2006-09-18T13:09Z,"Sinnersfury, if you have the original game, would it be at all possible for you to set up a new torrent?

Or do you know of someone else with a copy who could do so? Because I'd really love for people to try PS:T out, but it's becoming rapidly obvious that for some reason I'm not the dude for the job. 

(I'm uploading so slowly that by the time people finished the torrent, they'd only have five minutes to play before the Sun expanded to consume the Earth, which means they probably wouldn't even have time to get out of the Mortuary before dying a firey death, so you see the problem)

If you (or anyone reading this) can help out, you'd be my hero!

[I seriously don't know what's causing this problem, and am really, really, really sorry!]"
,Sinnersfury,2006-09-18T14:55Z,"As it is, my copy has a damaged disc (my brother scratched it not too long ago) so I am also downloading this =/"
,kitara,2006-09-18T16:41Z,"thx, dropp in now !!"
,lews001,2006-09-18T19:36Z,"I also have discs 1-3 of the orginal, but my fourth was destroyed via being stepped on :(  Truly one of the best games I've ever played.  Have actually been planning on ordering it through ebay for awhile now but saw your torrent, thanks for trying!"
,Sanctos,2006-09-19T15:10Z,aint this a mmorpg wich you need to pay monthly fees to play?
,lews001,2006-09-19T22:05Z,"no, its old school, 1999 i think, and not multiplayer at all, unless you do some sort of hot seat play or some such, it's somewhat like baldur's gate, but the story is outrageously better then even most of today's games"
,TheWhig,2006-09-19T23:42Z,"Yeah, there's pretty much no multiplayer capability at all.

It runs on the same engine as Baldur's Gate, hence the similarities. The combat in PS:T actually isn't quite up to par with the BG games, but the story and characters are much, much more developed."
,Psion,2006-09-22T13:43Z,Is this game still being seeded?
,lews001,2006-09-23T07:46Z,"I believe so, we are still working up to getting a second/third/ext. seed, as no ones finished the first run through yet, average is about 90% at this time"
,TheWhig,2006-09-23T08:48Z,"Should be done the initial seeding by tomorrow!

Now we hope that everything works once trasmitted!"
,Crescent99,2006-09-23T19:56Z,seems interesting.. you convince me!
,lews001,2006-09-25T06:11Z,"plays fine so far, only tested discs 1, 2, and 4
as my old save games were in disc 4, and the install is 1, and 2 is first play cd"
,Articluna,2006-09-28T12:07Z,"Well, at the moment there seems to be a nice amount of seeders (9 seeders, 10 leechers) so I'll try this one. Hopefully it keeps going on.

Also, I don't have that fast connection (256/256 only) but I'll keep it seeding till ration of 5 or 10. Won't be home for coming week or two so PC can load and seed in peace.

Oh and thanks, I've tried to find it two or four times a year for couple last years. :) Pretty much done with ""majority"" of other Black Isle games."
,cfinch777,2006-10-06T03:16Z,"I spent a couple hours using Nero, and Alcohol to try to find a way to burn the .nrg images with no luck.  I now have 7 coasters that look a lot like CD-R's :)

Is there a trick to this that I'm not aware of?  If I try to burn directly with Nero I get the ""foreign image setting"" window where I have to specify a block size etc.  I get an error stating that the entered block size does not correspond to the image length.  It will burn but the result is a CD that looks like it has data but when I open in Windows there is nothing on it???

I also tried mounting the CD and I cannot open it in Windows.  Lastly I copied the mounted virtual CD using the Alcohol CD copy wizard and again the resulting CD appears to be blank although it looks like data was written to the CD.

This is only my second torrent download so If I'm missing something please clue me in.  I'd love to play this game.  I played it several years ago and never finished...HELP :)

Thanks"
,Exorph,2006-10-23T16:38Z,"I'm having trouble installing the game.. something to do with a spells.* file..
Maybe I just have to reburn it.."

Yeah.  It's called Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale, Neverwinter Nights.  "
,Icendoan,2008-05-05T21:54Z,"NWN sucked. Majorly.

Icen"
,dearsir,2008-05-12T05:32Z,"This look like 4 CD ver. That mean to patch 1.1 or suffer bug.

Do so.

And if TheWhig 7-Zip first, total size would be half to download.

Have fun with great game."
,mufuti9,2008-07-09T08:15Z,"Oh yes indeed, the truly best singleplayer rpg up to this day. Only a couple other Interplay/Bioware titles can keep up the incredible high standards and art design of this great game (namely Fallout1&2,Kotor and Mass Effect if you ask me)

I own the game but was forced to look for a 4CD release torrent because exactly 1 file on my Disc 2 is broken :( - it is an old game, lot of time to scratch the CDs ^.^

speed is very good and if you never played this game you did right to come to this torrent, maybe you can be forgiven.

If you want a lot of neat enhancements, like restored ORIGINAL content that was cut out before release, a resolution patch to play in widescren or high def resolutions - NO stretching but true upscaling  - and a lot of other fancy stuff visit this place :

http://www.sorcerers.net/Games/Torment/index_mods.php

and google "" G3 widescreen planescape torment"" for the resolution fix.

Enjoy this great game, it is a timeless classic with an still unmatched excellence in storytelling."
,JenxRodwell,2008-07-10T13:49Z,...You're putting Mass Effect alongside Fallout 1&2 and Planescape? Surely you jest! I'd put the Baldur's Gate series in that list.
,Lloardinen,2008-08-05T21:22Z,"If this game is better than Baldur's Gate, I'll be playing it for days without a break....Man, this sounds promising!

as for Neverwinter, NvN 1 was pretty good IMO, but the 2 was a huuuuuuge dissapointment"

,MKorny,2009-02-19T04:21Z,"To be Honest, i only played this game for a few moments as i didn't had time by then...

,Kingfish540,2009-03-20T01:52Z,"I have the same problem as Kiugen. When I enter Dead Nations or any other place that requires I switch discs, I tab out to the Torment file and load Torment with Daemon Tools Lite but I can't re-enter  Torment."

,Tzaeru,2009-05-08T19:15Z,"To who implied Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale and Neverwinter Nights would be sequels to this: That's bullshit ;)

They are all VERY different games in atmosphere and style, mostly designed by different people and teams. Baldur's Gate 1 and Icewind Dale 1 are well done hack'n'slash, BG 2 is less so and more comparable to Fallout 1. Neverwinter Nights isn't even in same genre anymore, it's pure out action."
,Naffster,2009-06-24T07:13Z,"Could someone help me? I can't seem to get the installer to run. I mount the file, the first screen comes up mentioning something bout view demo install etc. I click install the screen dissappears but nothing happens..."

,d0000h,2009-07-15T08:16Z,"For help with this error...
An Assertion failes in D:\Torment\Source\chitin\ChDimm.cppp at line number 809

This happened when I used the wide screen mod. I found this on line and it worked to fix the problem:
""I got it to work!! As you said it was because my monitor doesn't ""normally"" supprot 1280x800 (Even though my native res is 1920x1200 so the aspect ratio is the same and it *should* work)

For others who need to fix this, here's what you do:

How I could tell my res was non-standard, when I got to Start->Settings->Control Panel->Display in the ""Settings"" tab theres a slider with screen resolution. When I change that slider around there isn't a 1280x800 displayed as an option (this is your problem).

Because I have an NVidia card/driver the fix is this:
1. Click the advanced button on the settings tab you're in
2. In the advanced menu, find the otpion on one of the tabs of ""Start the NVIDIA Control Panel"" and click it
3. In the Advanced Settings, go to ""Manage Custom Resolutions"" or something like that depending on your driver version.
4. There should be a checkbox along the lines of ""Allow modes not exposed by the display"" and check this box.
5. Now go back to your display settings resolution slider, 1280x800 should now be an option and this mod should work!"""

,ReIVIeDy,2011-05-29T07:33Z,"Here is how to fix some issues others were having that I stumbled on. I too was having these issues. Here is what I did:

Q. The resolution is awful! How do I fix it?

A. Install Bigg's Widescreen mod.
http://www.gibberlings3.net/downloads/widescreen-v2.60.exe

Q. When installing Wide-Screen, I'm getting an error saying EXE patching failed, or the software simply isn't installing.

A. Download the latest ver. 1.1 patch to fix. The software's author claims it doesn't matter, but it DOES when people are pirating it. Because the ver. 1.1 is an authentic Black Isle approved .exe, I guess the software likes it better. You also must do a FULL INSTALL of the game. This is a manual process. Please consult this link to do a full install.
http://bootstrike.com/Torment/Online/tti1.html

Q. What order do I install all the fixes?

A. http://www.gog.com/en/news/mod_spotlight_planescape_torment_mods_guide/

Q. Even though I did a full install, it still asks me for CD's. Furthermore, how do I switch CD's?

A. It's normal for the game to ask for CD's. It's not asking for them for loading purposes - it's doing it for authentication reasons in a poor attempt to deter piracy. Simply alt-tab and use Daemon Tools (or another CD swapping software) to load the correct CD file. Keep the CD files as backups - you'll need them! Once loaded, go back into the game and you should be fine."
,ReIVIeDy,2011-05-29T10:38Z,"Q. I'm having stuttering framerate issues!

A. Several solutions. It could be config related, in-game option related, D3DWindower related, driver related, and or Direct Draw related.
http://www.shsforums.net/topic/43616-how-to-deal-with-the-ddraw-problems-of-pst-and-other-ie-games

For config files, in the .ini, try setting...
CacheSize = 1
Path Search Nodes=32000
Maximum Frame Rate=40"
,ReIVIeDy,2011-05-29T20:46Z,"One warning: This game has taken me over four hours, and counting, in an attempt to get 100% working. If you're like me, you'll be using a lot of DirectX disabling techniques, downloading a lot of extra software (Windower, ShiftWindow, etc.) 

The best case scenario is many will have to run the game in a window. If you think you're going to run this full-screen on a modern system with NO stuttering, cursor issues, or side-effects, then you're mistaken.

In a nutshell, this game has NOT aged well. Most modern systems don't know how to interpret it, and yet, I'm running Win XP, not Vista or 7. If this game wasn't one of the best games of all time, I would have gave up a long time ago."
