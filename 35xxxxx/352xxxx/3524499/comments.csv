,andyasl,2006-12-14T18:35Z,"had the same prob.
when you put the game in the 360 and it starts to load press and hold the A button on the remote.
This will remove other game chatch that other games use to load quickly.
dont worry it dosent mess upp game saves or anything else-enjoy"
,KingKobra1,2006-12-27T06:51Z,Can someone please UPLOAD the NTSC/J version of this game!!
,CoachP,2007-01-04T07:43Z,"I just got a 360 Premium. Can anyone share techniques used to play the games, mod chip info, modders contact info, etc.? WVCoachPerry@aol.com if you dont mind contacting me. THanks All!"
[V],Loske,2007-01-24T17:36Z,"What the hell i PAL and that other stuff?... STCC or what it was named now again?

It really sucks that there is no explenation on how to actually make a game like this work on a 360 whitout a bunch of new PALs and a invissible formula1 race in the livingroom."
,barrybevel,2007-02-27T15:02Z,"Anybody got this to work for NME/XENO CHIP PAL 360? I converted it using NME Associator. Its the correct size, so I burned it on DL DVD +R Verbatim using Clone CD (twice) and no luck. Just says unreadable disc.. Any ideas? Thanks."
,barrybevel,2007-02-27T20:22Z,Burned this a third time and it worked. Must have been bad discs. So this is 100% working on PAL even when converted to NME/Xeno format. Thanks Pornopartner.
,halo37253,2007-04-09T18:42Z,man y is everything always pal. ntsc  is the best. we are the people that make these games and systems and never can i find a ntsc game. if it wasn't of America you would be stuck with Linux because mac and the almighty WINDOWS is American. AND SO IS THE XBOX360. so please try and post eather ntsc or region free. since this site was basically made to please the Americans. we make all the greatest games and software. but i guess you guys are the last to get the stuff since jap. is the second to get shit. and why still have pal when most your tv now can handle ntsc but i guess u wont be getting HD tv's widescreen for awile. 
,pheonixltd,2007-04-16T07:46Z,"if you do not know how to get these to play visit a great site that I have found 


xbox-network.org"
,eXon_,2007-04-21T23:07Z,Without Sweden you Americans wouldn't have this great webpage to download from! And since this is a Swedish page it's not so surprising if the games are PAL!
,snigelelefant,2007-05-03T14:54Z,the expansion pack? can you like download it here or do you have to get into live to buy it ??
,snigelelefant,2007-05-03T14:57Z,"to halo: Man you americans are all the same, always gotta be first, we gotta be the best country in the world, ''god bless america'' well there are tons of better countries and as exos said, piratebay is swedish and alot of uploaders with a PAL system are european so theres not much to do.. you greedy fuck"
,pheonixltd,2007-05-05T23:47Z,does anyone know where to download the ntsc version of this game?
,jerrinho,2007-05-21T16:27Z,"hi Could you tell me if it is also in Italian?
Answer me soon at jerry1987@hotmail.it
Thank you for your kind attention"
,joste89,2007-07-11T18:51Z,does this work with ixtreme 1.2?? really need to know.. ;o
,beedatopytia,2007-07-20T04:29Z,"So this won't work on an NTSC machine?
Excuse my ignorance"
,krille__1986,2007-08-11T04:45Z,"hey halo37253...
maybe you didn't now this but actually the xbox 360 is made in china, and if you don't like this PAL versions why don't you buy a PS3 then you don't need to worry about if it is PAL or not!
Just gave you a tip."
,krille__1986,2007-09-06T23:14Z,"Can't get it to work have tested with verbatim 2 times, traxdata 3 times and fujifilm 2 times.
Have the same prob. with saints row, crackdown, Fight night round 3 and amped 3.
Btw don't like these .000 files better with the old .iso."
,mylo2407,2008-02-23T07:37Z,how do i burn this on mac????
,Barasrs,2008-03-10T17:50Z,"wtf? Is this shit nuked?
It seem to contain no data either when running the .000 or .DVD through alcohol nor when it's burned to a DL DVD+R and insertet to either the DVD or XBOX 360."
,swedench,2008-03-27T07:26Z,"Hey guys! 
Downloaded the game and burned it, didnÂ´t work.
But i downloaded XDVDmulletter (hockeyfrilla pĂĽ SWE) and ran it throu a CRC check it missmatched when i had fixed it i opend dvd-decrypter and instead of ""label=unkown"" it said X360. I havent tried yet because im going to work. I will try this and if it works i will put in a mini tutorial and of course say if it works. P.s this is NTSC as well according do DVDmulletter."
,swedench,2008-03-27T17:10Z,"OK! so i tested it now.. IT WORKED =D

just download XDVDmuletter beta 9,7 
http://360hax.com/download.php?view.14

Open the app: Pick ""view ISO"" --> ""open from file"" open your IMAGE.000 and run the CRC32 check. it will say ""missmatch, try to rebuild or something like that"" to that it takes a couple of minuets than you will get all labels and stuff in IMGburn and CloneCD, I have BenQ XB360 reader and pioneer 112D burner hopefully it works for U"
,MelvinFoX,2008-06-19T17:28Z,Pornopartner u stupid fuck! U should get at least 3 bans for this stupid release! It's nuke! Wasted 2 DVD's for nothing. Do not download if u don't want to waste your DL's!
,Vilon,2008-06-25T23:48Z,Agreed 
,IDCz,2008-08-12T19:56Z,"@halo37253 1st of all, LEARN TO SPELL IDIOT!!! my 5 year old daughter can spell better than you...

,gamerfreak,2008-08-31T10:08Z,it worked
,knace,2008-10-02T16:29Z,"Whats up with the .000 file?! My last 2 downloads have been that I just cant make it work... the .iso-files is so easy to burn, why change it?!
Is there a speciall app that I need to use to burn .000-files or is it just BS? Using IMGburn..."
,aghil98,2009-03-28T06:40Z,SEEEEEEEED
,aghil98,2009-03-28T06:46Z,SEEEED!!!! SEEEED SEEEED SEEEED SEEEED SEEEED SEEEED SEEEED SEEEED SEEEED SEEEED SEEEED SEEEED SEEEED SEEEED SEEEED SEEEED SEEEED SEEEED SEEEED SEEEED SEEEED SEEEED SEEEED SEEEED SEEEED     (sry for spamming)
,aghil98,2009-03-28T12:39Z,when i extracted it the iso file was broken.and when i did view iso on XDVDmulleter it sad broken wanna fix i pressed ok then it sas something video file not found or something!!!! :(
,aghil98,2009-03-28T12:39Z,what shall i do
,desquishybanana,2009-04-06T06:36Z,"to all the people angry at halo37253, plz don't think of him as being like all other americans! a true american would know that no one country is the best. yes america can be great but without other countries, america would fail and this goes vice-versa. yes microsoft was made here but you must remember that microsoft sucks ass, but so does everything else in that field (the only reason i use anything microsoft is that its more familiar to me and it would be harder to change). yes they must thank us for the 360 and windows but we must thank them because (here's a little secret) most 360s are produced out side of the US. oh to all the idiots who know nonthing about this website; yes pirate bay is swedish but that doesn't matter, everything on piratebay is user posted. thats the reason you seed, so not everything on this site is from europe. so before you people open your mouth about something you don't know about, go learn about it first. 
and so what if it is PAL or NTSC! its a format, software not hardware. you can change your format on the file to be read as a PAL or NTSC or you could just hack your system to run either one, you shouldn't worry about your console because you are already breaking it in the first place."
,desquishybanana,2009-04-06T07:52Z,"now to get to the questions, this is the first time i am doing this but i am very familiar with most of the componets. the only reason i am asking these questions is because i dont want to risk screwing up my computer or my 360.
first question is that could i use a regular DVD+RW? i think i cant because it might be too small.
next question is do i need to get tools for my 360 inorder to do this? if so then just skip rest of the questions because i don't want to spend money on something that would cost more than the game.
next does this come with a guide on how to do this and if not then can someone give me a step by step instruction to this on either this page or email me at desquishybanana@yahoo.com.

last is that i dont want to get bricked (microsoft can give you the RROD on purpose if u get caught doing something like using illeagal copies of games or hacking/modding) or have my Live account banded or plane out something bad like that to happen. will i get caught or something along the line of that? i don't want to risk it."
,berloga,2009-04-15T19:46Z,"broken it was!
swedench THZ for tip!
But I used
XDVDMulleterBeta10.2!
And as you sad, fixed video, after that fixed crc,
Burned it,  and 
IT`s ALIVE!
Great game!"
,blinkmdg,2009-05-29T09:05Z,"Hey guys for anyone trying to download this game as of now (coz i kno its quite old) i had the worst time trying to get this to wrk. i was one burn away from completely giving up but 6 burns later i finally got it to wrk.

for those whose mulleter worked for this game congrats but mine for some reason did not. i read a couple of forums which sed that mulleter's database has been out for some while. so here goes

i hav mulleter version 10.2 and AGBX360 version 0.9.4 and i successfully managed to fix the .000 file with mulleter (if this doesnt wrk for u then try downloading another version of mulleter) but the CRC check did not coz it sed the ini file was missing and the game was not found in the database. However the CRC wrked perfectly on ABGX and thereafter i burnt it and it wrked. im not sure how important the first step was (as in using mulleter) but this is the order in which i dabbled with this image file and if it wrks it wrks.
jst didnt want anyone who wanted to enjoy this game hav to go thru wat i did hope this helps anyone downloading this game newly."

,shaneoc,2011-08-21T14:59Z,"this isnt working in any iso burner, its one of them new updates with the data that cant be cracked or something?? works with the xbox 360 burner anyway, try it: really simple and fast. http://www.xbox360burner.com"
,stevieb1980,2011-09-07T13:36Z,"Just for info, This worked for me first time, here is what i did:

1.Download....
2.Run IMAGE.000 through ABGX360 v1.0.5
Originally it came up with errors (dmi missing, ss missing etc etc)
Let ABGX download and fix errors (does automatically)
3.Run IMAGE.000 through ABGX again to check all is now good.
4.Burn using DVD+R DL disc (i use cheap aone discs and never fail) using Image Burn and by clicking on the Image.dvd file.
5. Put in your FLASHED xbox360 drive and play

Hope it helps
