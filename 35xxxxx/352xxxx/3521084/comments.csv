One comment though, it's best to package them seperately (a zip for each game in the torrent) so if someone is only interested in one game in the collection they dont have to download the whole set.
Thanks again"

,jalan,2007-07-22T15:48Z,"I agree with Johnny Zero that it would be nice to be able to download only the games I want. But even in that case, you ought to download all the pieces, but prioritize the ones you want, and then seed the whole package for a while. Give. some. back."

,Encrtia1,2008-07-31T22:36Z,"I seem to be hacing issues accesing these games.. Worms, the main one I'm focusing on, seems to not work... I hve DOSBox, and try to access this, using it on all .exe files, including SETUP and WRMS - but when I attempt on WRMS, it just freezes, and SETUP, is just for the sound. What can I do, or what should I do?
