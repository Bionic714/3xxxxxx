,rhebult,2006-09-21T21:16Z,"woooooooow!
been waiting 4 the missing dvd's in the series!!!

U da man!"
,Haldor_D,2006-09-22T12:58Z,oz72 - They WILL update the specialeffects (among other things). It hasn't been done yet. http://www.startrek.com/startrek/view/news/article/23775.html
,Haldor_D,2006-09-22T13:02Z,Correction - I meant the DVDs haven't been updated. As you can read in the above link they have started airing these revamped episodes on TV.
,MtnWalker,2006-11-01T03:37Z,Thank you very much Mr_Fear - a wonderful TV series and a superb torrent
,interntminne,2006-11-11T17:40Z,Thanks :)
,ngm51,2006-12-12T02:04Z,"Hi all, great torrents, I've been looking for these for a while...  I've downloaded a few of these, and tried to burn them. the DVD's play ok on my PC, but they don't play in the living room DVD Player... I've checked for protection but it doesn't seem to be an issue...  what am I doing wrong?"
,Killfly,2007-03-19T22:32Z,Thank you...
,Killfly,2007-03-21T20:00Z,"To NGM51:

These are PAL and not NTSC. Either your living room dvd player or tv set will not play a PAL disc.  Most new players and sets play both now.
2005 and newer, maybe 90%?

Speaking of % ..Mr. Fear didn't they ever remaster these and take out the dust and hair specks on the film? LOL ..I have viewdd them on local channels and in HD with no dust etc.  They really look pretty good for 60% quality.

Satisfied customer.  :p"
,ngm51,2007-03-21T23:02Z,Thanks Killfly...  that is what I tought....  time to trash the DVD player!
,Killfly,2007-03-23T10:30Z,"The Quality is...

Although I do appreciate just being able to get copies I have to say the quality of these once on DVD are terrible.   I have a new Sony 40"" tv and a new Oppo dvd player with fujora (sp?) decoding for high quality ...even at native PAL resolution these stink.

Better than nothing!

I'll download again if someone can offer better quality.  I spoke to soon saying these looked great. They do look better on computer."
