,younso,2006-09-14T14:31Z,"Great CONTRA2.
Any chance that you could scan the items I mentioned and post them as I torrent or email me them, younso at hotmail.com?"
,CONTRA2,2006-09-14T21:57Z,"Sorry, I don't have a scanner."
,younso,2006-09-14T22:54Z,"OK, and thanks for responding :)"
,thewonderer,2006-09-15T01:07Z,thanx for the heads up contra2... will wait until a release with just english audio is out there and no subs so best picture quality is obtained...
,younso,2006-09-16T17:03Z,"It does not fit on to a dvdrw according to Nero! People you might have to load it into DVD Shrink and shrink it a little bit (I think DVD Shrink says 0.7%). CONTRA2, I might suggest that next time you just take the original disc, load it into DVD Shrink which will automatically shrink the DVD9 to a DVD5."
[T],WinstonSmith6079,2006-09-28T12:32Z,"Heh, has Lucas FINALLY released this on DVD!?  It's about time, FFS!  This I gotta see!..."
,MiT,2006-09-28T14:58Z,"For those of you who want to burn this I reccommend a program like CloneDVD or CloneDVD2 that can strip audio out. 

Remove at least one language from the main movie and there's no problem burning this disc.
