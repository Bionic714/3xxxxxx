,phishvideos,2007-02-05T21:23Z,Sunblock take your fu**ing virus loaded shit elsewhere.  This is useless without the crack as it destroys the video with a huge subtitle saying it is evaluation and the crack is a virus so this shoud be nuked.
,flortristanw,2008-10-02T21:47Z,"Guys calm down. Cracks and keygens will tend to show up as a virus even though they aren't. I've run into that problem myself, my virus protection software would delete it right after I tried to run it. I bypassed my protection and it worked fine, NO VIRUS. "
