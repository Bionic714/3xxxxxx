Thanks "
,xwoz,2006-09-17T21:28Z,"They are being seeded, please be patient. Thanks for the thanks! :) I don't have great u/l speed, i decided to seed in order of the season so everyone can watch the season in order. My thinking is by the time you finish watching one disc, the next will be on it's way.
Enjoy!"
