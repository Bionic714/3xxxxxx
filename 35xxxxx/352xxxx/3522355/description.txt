Not a re-union, but the next best thing. John Dyson has gathered together various unreleased Wavestar pieces, some of which were destined for the follow-up to 'Moonwind', and released them on what is effectively a Wavestar retrospective. As John says himself in the sleevenotes "...I think I've forgotten most of the reasons why they were left to moulder. Therefore there is no reason why you shouldn't hear them." The journey begins with 'Messiah', recorded in early '88 and was perhaps destined to be the opener of the new album. It certainly has that "setting out" feeling and the 2:18 length suggest it may have been spliced with something else. 'Early Voyages' is an early version of 'Voyager' from the 'Moonwind' album. Same feel and atmosphere though the sequencing is only suggested, this being largely a sketch of the opening section. 'Early Rain' will be familiar to owners of 'Different Values' as the track 'Through the Rain' was based on this. John himself admits he prefers this version because of the sequencing and I agree. 'Doom' is dominated by dark percussives and by Wavestar's standards is a weird interlude. 'Sea' really was an adhoc number, quickly conceived and never revisited but sounding fresh and somehow newborn. Two different versions of 'Acrotramp' feature on the album, and with the first its your chance to add the lead-line. After reworking the piece with the TR707 drum machine they never got round to re-laying the theme, so it's Wavestar Karaoke time! Up to now the album has been largely as advertised, a collection of interesting sketches and early versions. However, with the next 2 tracks things start to get seriously interesting. 'Cleopatra's Barge' opens with classic Wavestar sequencing, constantly ebbing and flowing, supplemented by string synth refrains. It's a mesmeric piece which should have fans smiling with nostalgic pleasure. However, once they've heard 'Crystal Ashes' they should be jumping for joy. Described by John as '...the one track we did finish for the proposed album' this piece underlines what a masterpiece that was destined to be. Chunky analog sequencing, beautiful chord changes and succulent themes combine to perfection. Apparently it was aired at the '86 Electronica and though John confesses to having made a complete "balls-up" of it he's delighted to present it here as it should have sounded! 'Theme' is a bright optimistic affair to match the athletics festival it was written for. Superficially it can sound lightweight but the sequencing especially must have taken some time to put together. 'Turkish Bizarre' is a suitably atmospheric piece laden with eastern promise. A delightful reedy synth theme is backed by complex percussive sequencing. 'Acrotramp 86' is actually a very different piece to the original and is in no way inferior. It's another beautifully crafted outing with pulsing rhythms and a whimsical lead. A remix of 'Messiah' ends the album - "more in time than out of time" are John's concluding comments, hinting at the double edged origins of the album title. John as ever is doing himself an injustice. There's plenty to please on this album with 'Crystal Ashes' alone destined to become an all time classic alongside 'Time Node' and 'Voyager'. (GG)
