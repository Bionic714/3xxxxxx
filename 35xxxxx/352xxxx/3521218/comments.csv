There is NOTHING in this movie that can be cut out without totally ruining the movie. Why spend all this time butchering a great movie just because you don't like it? Fuck you, man."
,RetardedPuppy,2006-09-10T00:18Z,It's just a movie. Did you even download and watch it?
,gukko,2006-09-14T22:41Z,i like the movie but recut is not good as i think
,disobedient,2006-09-16T03:50Z,"""The terrible love story between Padme and Anakin has been removed almost entirely.""

So you cut out the scenes of one of the hottest women on the planet?  Nice one."
,damienfrost,2006-09-30T09:42Z,"Interesting.  I'll check this out as I personally think that all three prequels were terribly done.  I'm curious to see if this is more enjoyable.

It is too bad that there's no way to cut out the love story while leaving Natalie Portman's scenes intact.  But for any Portman fans out there, just go watch V for Vendetta, it's a much better movie anyways.

Thanks"

Just pick another torrent!"
,FedericoDK,2007-07-18T00:08Z,"Great..!!

But even thou, it's still has a flow problem. But atleast it's better. 

And to Soundwall... it's diffently not a great movie, and if you not like it, don't download it. Even if it's actually better..
