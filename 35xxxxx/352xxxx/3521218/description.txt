Star Wars II - Recut of the Clones

Sorry to those who were downloading the first copy. I had to take down the first copy because the audio was out of sync in some parts. This is the same copy but with the audio fixed. Again, sorry.

About 26 minutes of the movie have been removed.

Recut to rid the movie of as much of the boring scenes and horrible dialogue as was possible. The terrible love story between Padme and Anakin has been removed almost entirely. They are horrible actors. The story is intact. The movie flows better this way.
