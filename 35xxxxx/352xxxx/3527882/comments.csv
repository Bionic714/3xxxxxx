,jaraeez,2007-05-12T04:43Z,"StiCkS515000 - lol i know how you feel about wind0$e anyway go here http://distrowatch.com/ have a look  & download anyone you like there all free. This is a VMware (virtual OS) which you can run in wind0$e, MAC or Linux. Do a google for 'Linux live CD' then download one burn it to CD & reboot your OS making sure that your system is set to boot from CD 1st.... the rest will be obvious - good luck"
