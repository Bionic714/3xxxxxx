PCLinuxOS 0.93a (aka Big Daddy). This is a full version of the PCLinuxOS Distribution. After installing PCLinuxOS to your computer, you can access an additional 5000 programs and libraries from their free software repository. If you are tired of Windows constantly crashing all the time, the blue screens of death, the nasty viruses/trojans, constant pop-ups, and sluggish performance then PCLinuxOS is for you.
