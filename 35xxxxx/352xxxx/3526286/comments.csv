,blemishednicely,2007-11-15T15:44Z,"I managed to get the game to run, using a combo of Daemon and WinRAR, but no matter what I do, I can't seem to get certain audio components to play-ie; footsteps, voices...didn't really play through to see if gunfire/elevators/other environmental SFX...any suggestions on that or is this strictly a ""mute"" version of the game? would really like to know---I am a mentally deranged stalker in regards to my love for this game---(It makes my heart feel like a dark, shadowy hedge by  Eidos Interactive's well-lit bedroom window)"
,blemishednicely,2007-11-25T08:21Z,"I'm not seeding this and am about to dump it from my files, as it seems to be missing vital audio portions-really sucks when you're all set up but can't hear someone open the door & walk up to you...the first sign of shit going down is the occasional shadow or the sound of gunfire going off right behind your head-if anyone else managed to get FULL sound I'll hold off for a bit, to see any suggestions but otherwise I say don't bother here-get a COMPLETE version."

Works like a charm.

,blemishednicely,2008-03-22T00:53Z,"'Kay, I've been paying GameTap to play this, and had the same sound issue-1st I was pissed 'cause the paid service seemed to screw up...then I felt somewhat embarrassed when I realized I'd been retarded enough to look for a solution everywhere but the in-game menu-Damn! If you seem to get SOME sounds, but NO footsteps, door noises, Etc.-check out the 
""Use Hardware"" box somewhere in the in-game menu, shut it off & you should be fine (might've fu**ed up the name ""Use/Enable"", but ""Hardware"" is definite - it's a check-box). As for FruKtaH's elevator issue, quite a few people can't quite get the hang of the menus that are seemingly only used by R-clk'ing, or rolling the mouse wheel...that should allow you to use the control panel's ""floor switch"" and choose a higher/lower floor. I had a few issues w/ GameTap's Vers. freezing my character in place if he was moving while the doors shut-if I stood still and proceeded after they'd closed, no problem...weird!"
,blemishednicely,2008-03-22T00:57Z,"BTW-Can I get some seed so I can see if I was just being dumb, after all? I remember the only problem I had was the partial sound loss (resulting from that  ""Hardware"" option via the in-game menu), and now I know how to avoid it (I think). Please seed me, I LOVE this one the best (out of the series)!!!"
,don_karollo,2008-08-11T14:01Z,"HELLO BUDDIES :) I DON`T KNOW HOW TO SEED. WHAT DOES IT MEAN? Seed = you're offering the file for others to download from you.

,tay1321,2008-08-17T06:56Z,can u show me the step by step to downloading these torrents and turning them into games i got all the programs i need but i just dont kno where to put the crack file at.

,777677467767469,2010-01-24T09:37Z,hey for anyone getting a stuttering effect in the game.... run it in compability for win 98/me... worked like a charm for me....
,xxdisturbed1xx,2010-03-23T06:50Z,to slayersboxer... when ur done downloading the game usually wat u need to do is mount it with daemon tools lite... after that just install the game and there ya go... some games need cracks tho... usually the crack should be involved with the download soo if u see a crack file go into that and copy the .exe file and go back to the main part where u saw the first .exe file and replace it with the one u copied and run the game and there ya go =D hope that helped

,Fem0o0o,2010-07-07T13:15Z,how the fuck are you suppose to reduce the game speed?
,RedEagle701,2011-05-15T19:20Z,"@tay1321  the best way (recommended)

go to www.gamecopyworld.com and search for hitman codename 47 choose a game fix then download it from a mirror site and extract it and copy the exe. and right click the icon on your desktop  and select open file location and paste it

if it did not work install the patch i'm pretty sure it will work"
,Cordelle,2011-06-29T06:06Z,"Thanks ktruba. Works like a charm.
I have encounterd two problems though:
1) The game has, on occasion, suddenly ended during gameplay
2) The Gun Runner's Paradise level will not allow me to complete the mission. I do everything right but it still says that the mission failed"
