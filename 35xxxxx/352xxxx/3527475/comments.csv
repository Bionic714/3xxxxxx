,tobiasgard,2006-09-28T17:44Z,Går inte att packa upp :S
,stumpalump,2006-09-28T23:54Z,Doesn't work for me either. Just gets a black screen. I think it's freezing the xbox. I tried clearing cache and no joy from disc or hdd. Never had problems with pal before. Xenium ICE 1.6
,megagbg,2006-09-29T16:36Z,"I cant extract it.. it says ""no archives found""
Why?? can anyone help me??"
,foo55,2006-09-29T20:03Z,"i actually cant play this game on my xbox either.  if the game hangs, it means youre trying to run it in ntsc mode.  in xbmc you can 'enable video switching' and get the game to run in pal.

if youre lucky, the game wont be in black and white and flickering.  if you are unlucky to have that happen it means your tv cant handle pal video, you should probably try on a different tv or just give up like i did."
,PanzerRanger,2006-09-30T11:32Z,The game does´nt work from hd ordisc. I use a version 1.6 Xbox with Executer bios
,breakfast4,2006-09-30T15:24Z,Doesn't work for me either. Just gets a black screen. I think it's freezing the xbox.

,SALUTE79,2006-10-03T17:03Z,"Ok thanks again! Works great on pal xbox.

No problems, will say again just unrar and then use nero6 burning rom, open the ISO and burn it at a sensible speed.. simple, does it all for you!

Thanks!"
,columbo99,2006-10-06T11:45Z,"Game works perfectly, burned to dvd then transferred over to my xbox HDD. No problems  at all.

,The NbL,2006-10-09T17:03Z,Make a few copies....if the first one is a coaster try different program and a slower speed. DVD decrypter and 2x worked for me. And i made 3 coasters.

,morseman21,2006-10-15T05:30Z,"Your all a bunch of Wankers! Pirates don't bitch and moan like little cunts getting fucked. 
If you can't get it to work it's becasue you're an idiot, if you have problems downloading it's because you haven't forwarded your ports correctly or your to fucking cheap to get a fast internet connection!"
,feere99,2006-10-15T14:57Z,how do u foward ur ports
,morseman21,2006-10-15T15:52Z,"Go to the help section of this website and you will find all the links and info you will need to make sure you are properly downloading.

,vikes,2006-10-17T07:44Z,Thanks for the game seed. :)
,nexus420,2006-10-19T21:32Z,"I have never had a problem playing a PAL game on my modded NTSC xbox, until this one...so just because I can't get this one to play properly on a NTSC tv doesn't mean I'm an idiot.  Video mode switching only works if your tv will support PAL (and mine doesn't)  So, this works on PAL tvs ONLY....that is all..."
,Eugordon,2006-10-27T16:26Z,I definitely have new coasters...will try 2x DVD dcecrypter
