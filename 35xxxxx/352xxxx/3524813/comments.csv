,wolverine_matt,2006-09-21T09:21Z,What codec do I need to play this?!
,wolverine_matt,2006-09-21T12:08Z,Help. All I'm getting is audio.
,wolverine_matt,2006-09-21T17:46Z,"No luck with VLC. I have the latest version. I also have the latest Xvid codec, and have tried it with windows media player and Real player, all without success. :s"
,mrtn,2006-09-21T18:20Z,Heard itÂ´s a fake.
,wolverine_matt,2006-09-22T16:40Z,"Well it seems this file has no video encoded. Gspot only recognised the audio. It certainly is the audio for the film, but that just makes it more annoying having downloaded it. Grrr!"
[V],bendowling,2006-09-22T21:12Z,Yeah no luck for me either - gotta be a FAKE
,MrRedBlue,2006-10-25T23:00Z,"The DivX player won't play it either, but it displays file info:

Video Track #1:
FOURCC: ""MPEG"" (MPEG-1 Video)
1755x110, 30,000031 fps
Audio Track #1:
FormatTag : ""80"" (MPEG-1 Layer-2 Audio (mp2))
2 channels, 44100Hz

As you all can see the video frame size is f#ck#d up !

Searching the web the genuine movie should have a filesize of 699.00 MB (732 954 624 Bytes)."
,probate,2007-02-12T07:31Z,"Hey at least you guys get audio, there's a bunch of us stuck on 95.7% for the last two weeks, any seeders?"
,spacehorse,2007-06-24T22:58Z,"Has this torrent worked for any of the 1309 downloaders? Audio only for myself and the other commentors. If this is universal, STOP seeding!"
