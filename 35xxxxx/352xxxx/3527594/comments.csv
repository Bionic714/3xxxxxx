,nero89,2006-10-08T07:25Z,hi.. i was wondering how do u use the torrent? omg.. i can't seem to use it anyway.. pls help me out thanks =)
,deamon2000,2006-10-08T13:21Z,"nero89 
the simplist way i can tell you is to dl the program called utorrent install it then run the torrent file you dl'ed from here should open a box that show the 3 files and where you want to dl it then ok that let it dl and it should tell you when its finished 
it will take a while so just wait  but when its done use a program called WINRAR to unRAR (like unzip) then unrar the file  Heretic II.rar then with a program like achahol 120% or clone cd (idk if clone cd can read this type of iso?)
burn the game as copy protected game to a cd then install the game from the newly burned cd 
then install the patch! hope that helps"
,cyberdaemon,2006-11-02T17:06Z,"I did burn it to cd and installed it , but something went wrong and it still asks cd... so i tryied a no cd crack and none of them i downloaded didnt work... any ideas ? "
,deamon2000,2006-11-04T03:59Z,"cyberdaemon
uninstall the game and del folders if any left over then reintall game AND IN STALL THE PATCH ( MUST DO THIS ) then dl the crack thats the same VERSION (1.64 for example) and REGION( 1.64 US OR uk version of crack  for example)  as the game patch then install and play





NOTE TO ALL PATCH BEFORE YOU START A NEW GAME OR SAVES WILL NOT WORK EVEN IF U HEX EDIT THE VERSION NUMBERS IN SAVE GAME FILE !!!!"

,szederp,2008-03-19T23:54Z,"I don't know if you still read this Deamon, but thank you for this torrent. What a marvelous, breathtaking game. Back in the old days they really knew what atmosphere meant..."
,666orba666,2008-04-09T12:19Z,"Everybody should have daemon tools by now, its just a waste to burn stuff anymore when you can make a ISO on your HD and mount it virtually."
,lol123lol,2008-05-28T18:50Z,"that's a very great game

=)"
,uselesswarrior,2008-06-21T18:01Z,"Just a word of warning, cd image is in NRG not in ISO format. Kinda sucks if you don't have Nero. However there are tools out there to convert, hopefully they work on this particular file."
,deamon2000,2008-06-24T13:01Z,you should burn it im pretty sure daemon tools dont play the sweet soundtrack
,Knight_Marez,2008-08-10T15:25Z,Thanks for this torrent. I've been looking for this game for ages and I finally found it.
,afreet5,2008-08-16T08:54Z,thanks alot .... extremely nice game and nice torrent
,deamon2000,2008-10-16T05:26Z,your welcome now if some one can only seed 3ds max 5 iso ill put more up
,zeracles,2008-11-26T20:40Z,"Financinal crysis - sux - Heretic (and Hexen, by the way =))) Forever!!!"
,mcgza,2010-08-17T00:40Z,"hey guys ive tried using the cd but couldn't get the audio, but when i opened up itunes there are the 13 tracks so i can listen to the soundtrack but not from the game on the right levels."
,Gashimahiron,2011-02-01T10:46Z,"Did you guys know that nero also mounts disc images?
if most of you are trying to mount a image instead of wasting a precious one million dollar CD! then follow these instructions:
since some older games have compatibility issues, when you mount a image with daemon tools the 3600x speed makes the game act weird or not recognize it, SO just go to nero(nero 6.xx.xx.xx not so specifically: ) then mount the image by toggling advanced user mode then going to extras(i suppose) and selecting mount image, or something like this...
then, since nero already comes with a speed limit it'll run ok, if not, then it's another side of hassle and you need to configure the speed manually, i won't explain this here now because i'm too lazy for it...
daemon tools lite DOES mount nrg images so don't worry,if you REALLY want daemon then good for you!
still daemon tools don't run some music pretty well, i tried the half life music but it failed, i tried again and restarted half life and it worked...
strange...
there is a way to mount a image on newer nero versions, i just didn't try it yet so when i find a way i'll explain(or try to) here!
don't care about the others deamon(2000)! you have uploaded a great torrent and it's a game i've been searching for a long time now!
just keep your cat away from your modem, and your monitor too...
i had to buy both new ones because my cat(s) destroyed them..."
,Gashimahiron,2011-02-01T10:51Z,"OH!

keep seeding!
i almost forgot about it!
i'll seed for at least one hour per day, guaranteed!
i could seed the whole day but, well...
NO!
i don't want a melted internet cable or wireless antenna again...
overheat happens!"
,kelv1969,2011-11-10T12:00Z,I remember playing this over ten years ago on my pentium 1 pc running windows 98. It ran very well and looked very good. Great 3d third person adventure. full of action and puzzles. Why oh why do we need such powerful pcs to play games today when you can show a game like this running on such a low spec machine. Mad world.
