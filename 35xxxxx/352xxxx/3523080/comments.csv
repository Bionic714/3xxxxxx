Im a swedish man who was in the Philippines last year to visit my gf. On the radio we heard this filipino version of System of a downs song Chop suey by Parokya ni edgar. I really liked that song alot and got more curious about this band even if I dont understand much of what they are singing, I just know a few words in tagalog but I would like to know if that song I was talking about is on this torrent or if u have it and in that case can upload that song here. Thanks! Ingat ka! /Hugo"
