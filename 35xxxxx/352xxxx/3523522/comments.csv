So long in fact it was before I had WinXP and probably WinME.

Basically, I had some trouble installing and running it so for anyone else who has problems:
To install:
You need to open the properties for ""setup.exe""
Under the compatibility tab check ""Compatibility mode"" and set it to Win95.
Click ""Ok""

To play:
Open up to the compatibility tab for ""CSTORM.exe"" in your installed folder.
Check ""Run in 256 colors.""
Click ""Ok""
Note: This will kill your desktop colors, just change them back to normal if you want to play and do something else."

,dickow,2008-03-19T04:25Z,"alright so I switched the compat on setup.exe, it still won't run any other sugestions?"
,george1122,2008-03-23T15:47Z,"i have found how to run it under XP
1: just copy CSTORM folder from the CD to where you want to have the install.Then just adjust the cstorm.exe to run in compactibility mode Win 95, and in 256 color mode and u r done. Apperently you can run the game form the cd, without installing anything, but i didnt try that.

,swampthing6166,2009-07-08T23:36Z,Can someone please seed this?  I've been looking for this game for years and I'm halfway done downloading it.
,154752,2010-12-25T14:46Z,dayoung1 do you happen to have also all of the audio tracks from the game? could you upload them? I don't really care if they're in MP3 format or whichever else. they are so scarce or actually non-existent on the net that finding them by myself is impossible.
,bluemann101,2012-05-01T03:21Z,For all those questions of it wont run in compatibility mode what do I do.. goto www.dosbox.com and download the emulator. After doing so follow the instructions on how to use and enjoy! Power to the Dos Gamers
