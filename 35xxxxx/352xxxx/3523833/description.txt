"Something horrendous is happening in the sleepy fishing village of Noyo. An aqua-culture experiment has gone very wrong and the results -fish-like humanoids- are rising from the sea to spawn their revenge!"

Cool Roger Corman B-movie which barrows (HEAVILY) from other monster flicks (Creature From The Black Lagoon, Alien) which includes plenty of nudity and gore -PERFECT ingredients for this 1980"midnight drive-in" classic!

Barbera Peeters directed until it was time to add the gore and nudity, then was fired and another diector was brought in.

The sea creatures were created by Rob Bottin before he went on to creat the werewolf suits and effects for Joe Dante's THE HOWLING. James Horner, who later won an Oscar award for the music in James Cameron's TITANIC, wrote the music for this movie.

Ripped from now Out-Of-Print DVD. 

If you like classic, exploitive, cheesy monster flicks complete with gratuitous nudity and gore, than this movie is for you! ENJOY!
