,peniscilin,2006-09-14T09:36Z,"You noted ""Ripped from now Out-Of-Print DVD"". Is this ripped from the New Horizons U.S. DVD? If so this version is heavily censored. Or is this another one with all gore intact? There were some uncut tape releases out. Please lemme know. If UNRATED I would like to download it but censored crap ain't my turn.   "
,dahulk12,2006-09-14T14:53Z,"This is the American NEW CONCORDE version. I believe it IS censored. What was removed from American version by the MPAA was a decapitation. If you look closely in this American version near the end of the movie, you will see a creature begin to rip a man's head off but it then cuts away to another scene. What you are talking about is a FOREIGN version (Japanese?) where it shows the full decapitation. This foreign version was retitled MONSTER, not HUMANOIDS FROM THE DEEP. This foreign version is currently being sold on eBay in DVD form but it is for a ripped version, as you have said, from a tape source.  If I could have purchased the ORIGINAL foreign DVD release, believe me, I would. I like a good monster flick as much as the next guy. But I don't want to have to watch a ripped version made from a fuzzy tape. So, to answer your question, this is censored version. SORRY!"

,EwigD,2009-11-22T06:04Z,Is the decapitation all that is censored or is the whole movie all cut up?
