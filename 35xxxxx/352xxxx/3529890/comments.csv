,ntixitjo,2008-12-13T05:59Z,"for christ's sake, just look on IMDB. http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0427954/

yes, a better title for the torrent would have been tom yum goong or the protector 2, however he is NOT incorrect! this movie was called Ong Bak 2 for a long time in thailand until the producers of the Ong Bak 2 coming out this year talked to them and they changed it. everyone's right, so everyone chill out... AAAAAGGHHH!"
