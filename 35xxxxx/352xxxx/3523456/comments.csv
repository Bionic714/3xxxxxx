,avlmtns,2006-09-22T07:17Z,The serial number I'm using (the E19EB89 . . . number) isn't working.  Is this the correct number?

,needtorrent69,2006-10-01T21:43Z,Instead of downloading the entire file.  Can someone be kind enough to list the serial number that's listed in the SERIAL.TXT file? Much appreciated. Thanks in advance.
,olan_b,2006-10-02T02:39Z,"If your using uTorrent, just open the torrent and when the tracker/file screen opens up (the one where you have to say ok to continue), just deselect everything but the serial.txt file.....  Im sure you can do this with otther clients too."
,olan_b,2006-10-02T02:42Z,"Oh, just realised you probably knew that and realised (before i did) that its a single .zip file..... will post serial when i download."
