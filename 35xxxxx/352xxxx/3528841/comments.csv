,ralphhabbshat,2006-09-28T19:09Z,"Hi - I'd just like to say thanks again to TokusatsuMaster  for posting this great series - and a really big thanks for keeping it up all the way to the end ! I'll help seed the last half for another few weeks. If anyone is interested, a similar series ""Space Giants "" has been posted by a kind person over at Demonoid (They are open for registrations evey weekend) - it's 52 episodes in English over three 4+ Gig DVD's - well worth it if you liked this ! If anyone out there is taking requests, I'd love to see the original Ultra 7 series. The original Ultraman is available in lots of places, but I've only ever seen a few episodes of Ultra 7, and the Kaiju look really great - so if anyone can help - pretty please ! English dub or original (or anything!) would be fine ! Anyway, one last round of applause for our generous provider of Giant Robo goodness ! Thanks again, man !!! Best wishes - John"
