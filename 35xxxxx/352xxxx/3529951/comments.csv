,0rr,2006-09-29T14:08Z,"it plays in many ways like Total Overdose. If you liked Total Overdose you'll like this one, too. Some parts even are realized exactly how it's been done in TO. Nice game though, it's cleaner and straighter than TO, which is a lot dirtier, meaner and offensive (especially to Mexicans). "
