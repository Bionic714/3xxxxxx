Experts keep telling us that man is directly responsible for global warming, yet most of us carry on doing precisely the things that are driving climate change. But when the peerless David Attenborough looks out of your TV screen and asks, "How could I look my grandchildren in the eye and say I knew about this [climate change] - and I did nothing?" it makes you stop and think. In the conclusion of his two-part film, he discovers that the Earth's future could be very bleak. If CO2 reaches a particular level in the atmosphere (the "tipping point"), we could lose entire ecosystems such as the Arctic, while entire cities - such as London - could be drowned by its melting ice. It's not too late to do something, though. Fictional family the Carbons show us where we're going wrong and what we can do to put it right.
