Many many ''thank you's'' to everyone who helped seeding the DS9-series, and naturally to the MASTER HIMSELF bender-c.
All the happiness, luck and health in your life for you and your family and friends. Specially with your daughter Alice ! !"

Also thanks to all the others who uploaded all the wonderful torrents.

Thank you all!!"

Thanks once again"
,Da King,2006-09-06T22:38Z,"Hey Lord Bender-c! Didn't know about that add-on to your family: congratulations! Wow, how cool is that! A baby daughter AND a new home. It must feel fantastic to be able to manage these two happenings in such short time! Tell you what: I'll keep my eye out for a cool little Star Trek thing for the baby room! Or maybe someone here has something suitable for a baby girl already? If I find something I will IM you. I know it may be a while before you get back online, but if the Piratebay doesn't go down, the message will be there. 

Now go be a daddy!"

,levdr,2008-01-09T03:39Z,"There must be people here who also downloaded the previous seasons. S6D6 and S6D7 (of the  bender-c release) are abandoned: no seeds and a whole bunch of us stuck at 96,7 and 99,9 percent respectively. Please, would somebody be so kind as to reseed these two torrents, so we can complete our download. Thank you so much!!!"
,V4Friend,2008-01-10T08:24Z,"Again, I would like to support levdr's request: could someone please seed S6D6 and S6D7 for a while, so we (and many others) can download and then seed them?"

,longdutchman2,2008-07-20T10:34Z,Im already seeding season 1-5 (s5 disc1-disc3) and i want to help seeding with the last seasons . The last ones are ISO files and unfortunately my original downloads are lost due to system failure.  I have only the burned discs. I cannot succeed creating the same ISO files as the uploader did because probably im not using the same software. So could the uploader bender-c please tell me wich software is used to create that ISO files so that i can create the same ISO  files from my discs so that i can also help seeding this ones. THANX in advance.
,badImage,2009-01-03T18:11Z,"Please please SEEEEEEED. I'm just missing the last part, I will seed too but the torrent doesn't finish!!! PLEASE!
