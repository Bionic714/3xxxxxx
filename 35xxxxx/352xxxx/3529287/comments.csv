,Temptation,2006-09-26T09:57Z,so. which version is better? theatrical one or the TV one?  Did the theatrical one have additional scenes.. or was it cut ?
,Dash101,2006-10-01T04:04Z,"I have to agree. This is easily one of the best documentaries I have ever seen. And I work in the film business so I really give a lot of respect to this man and this film.. Its fantastic...

(And yes, even folks in the biz download films. Hurrah for piracy!)"

But the ALLiANCE DVDrip version I downloaded the other night has very bad framerate, so choppy I had to stop the video despite the intriguing content. I'm sure it's an honest mistake. The documentary is made by BBC, which means a British standard 25FPS video. ALLiANCE tried to conform it to NTSC, which of course didn't work. I hope this one is done properly."
