,hellaraiser,2007-02-24T08:12Z,really really like this... thank you very much :)
,korbiekwan,2007-04-16T09:49Z,"Yeah, ""Details"" is an unbelievable album. Even today, it still sounds excellent.  "
,korbiekwan,2007-04-16T10:06Z,"I really can't believe ""Shh"" nor ""Flicks"" were never singles from Details, they are two of the best songs on the album. Although the whole album is damn good. Those ones really stand out in my opinion. I'm sure others will agree."
,korbiekwan,2007-04-16T10:08Z,Oh...I should mention...thanks for the up escapist! 
,escapist,2007-05-27T14:03Z,"You're welcome :) But although I can back you on Flicks, my faves are Only Got One and Hear Me Out. Still, picking out the tracks on that album that don't stand out is easier, just Psychobabble and Maddening Shroud. The rest are all amazing, IMO."
,rustedearth,2007-09-01T02:53Z,"nice upload, but why would you make a 'discography' of a band who has only released one album, and probably never will again?"

,SYNAESTHE5IA,2010-06-06T03:35Z,"Thanks for this. I love Imogen's solo albums, but have never heard anything from her Frou Frou period. I like to try before I buy wherever possible too, so this is great."
