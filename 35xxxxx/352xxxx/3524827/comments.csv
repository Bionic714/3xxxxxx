,qwyjibojones,2008-01-15T05:36Z,Thanx for this!! How many stations call signs make it into Oscar winning major motion pictures??? And coming from a smallish city like Cincinnati at that!
,Grizzley91,2009-03-28T21:56Z,"Awesome torrent, thanks for taking the time to assemble it. Have to point out though - 97X was broadcast from Oxford, Ohio (home of Miami University), not Cincinnati."
