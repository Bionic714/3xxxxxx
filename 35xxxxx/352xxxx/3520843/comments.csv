,nonantroll,2008-05-21T02:16Z,"MP4 may be compressed like the dickens, but it plays crappily.
I convert mine to .AVIs with WinAVI Video Converter, and they work fine.
They take twice the space, but hey, can't have everything!
There's a free mp4 player that occasionally works, should you not want to shell out your sheckles, but it's tragically flawed:  it's on the Net, offered by a company called ""I've found.""

Pazera has a free converter, but you need a Cray computer and a few weeks of leisure time just to do a single flick."
