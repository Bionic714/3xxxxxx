,Heybaperiba,2007-10-12T21:45Z,"This video does not play properly, too bad...was really looking forward to this show:(

(At least not in VLC or Media Player, the picture and sound is not in sync, the picture stops from time to time, and so on)"
,nikrusty,2007-12-30T16:55Z,Heybaperiba looks like a prob with ur codecs probably!! Check those...I dunno someties codecs just mess up with one file even if its VLC and Media player both...try at a friends place and see.
