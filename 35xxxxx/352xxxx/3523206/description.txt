
A couple of albums from the earlier part of the Robin Trower trio. 
Trower's never been ashamed to admit to his obvious Hendrix-influences - mind you, who could be ashamed of playing guitar so well?  He's no imitator though, in the sense that he doesn't simply repeat a few Hendix cliche riffs; rather he's learn the style, the approach and based his own work on it and very well too. 

There's no danger of mistaking him FOR Hendrix - apart from having a softer, rounder sound he just hasn't got the sheer fire and abandonment.  On the other hand, his music is non the poorer for that and perhaps sweeter to some ears/minds than Hendrix's raw - and sometimes even scary outpouring of emotion? 

Anyhow, his excellence as a guitarist and songwriter is undeniable and coupled with Dewars powerful voice, these albums a good listen.
