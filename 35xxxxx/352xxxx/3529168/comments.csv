,Mjr_ZiP,2006-09-25T17:53Z,"Ripped: Movies, Speech, Music

Not very suprising that the size has shrunk so much"
[T],songojk,2006-09-25T18:40Z,"this is no my rip, DOOM group ripped this game"
,barp,2006-09-25T20:20Z,"@songojk - nothing agaist you, thank you for uploading, vut the group who made this rip, they are stuiped..."
,Karmeck,2006-09-25T23:23Z,"tehy riped it down to 601 meg, tehy did not tip out 601 meg, only riping the movies take out 2,28gig. so they did a nice work."
,Churchills Dog,2006-09-26T01:32Z,"Karmeck, I came here to post the same thing after just installing it. I know very little about hacking, coding etc but I'm beginning to understand just how skilled these guys are.

They musta had to stand on top of their HD and jump up and down on it to get the files packed so tight!  ;P"
,Robbie785,2006-09-26T02:59Z,"a game the required a dual-layer dvd, down to a single CD. hahahaha DOOM ftw. nice work (but i already have full game)"
[T],Knaster,2006-09-26T13:43Z,Totally awesome and to the game devs i just say HAHA (Nelson)
,Karmeck,2006-09-26T14:12Z,the rip is 5gig instald
,Mjr_ZiP,2006-09-26T17:06Z,"Not really, most of it is just ""fake"" files that Windows reads as real but when packed takes 0. I think, that is normally the case with rips ;)"
,Churchills Dog,2006-09-26T19:37Z,"works great, no excessive sttutering like there as in the initial CLONEDVD release"
,Churchills Dog,2006-09-26T19:39Z,"Oh, BTW, this game sucks. So much potential but they didn't take advantage of the large areas by adding interesting side mission like GTA. Physics are too floaty etc."
,-OLDBOY-,2006-09-27T13:40Z,"Yeah, i have the game, and its boring!
Car physics sucks, the car doesnt even get a scratch when hitting a rock in like 200 km/h..."
,sobson,2006-09-28T15:55Z,very good rip but game sucks :( (is there any lector or music (only the farting of weapons :D) in this crap? 
,Arkinos,2006-09-30T13:08Z,"you guys who keep asking about sound, movies, bugs.. or anything.. you should keep in mind that this actually is a "" rip ""  wich means that the quality of this torrent is lowered bt 99 fucking percent!! this sucks.. come on!! download the real freakking 6 gig game... i did it. mine works fine. awesome!"
,ilyn,2006-11-23T21:05Z,I have it now and it is exactly 605.89MB!
,Champii,2007-02-16T11:07Z,"Varför funkar det inte o köra Setup.bat?
Dos-programmet kommer upp, sen när jag klickar på nån tangent så stängs det bara ner!

Why doesn't Setup.bat work?
The Dos-program runs, but when i click any key, it just quits!"
