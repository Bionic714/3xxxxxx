This is a collection of all Civilian Canadian instrument flight publications effective 28 September 2006.  Included are all HI and LO charts, Instrument Procedures, and Aerodrome Directories in PDF format.

I will upload VNCs / WACs / VTAs / TACs if/as they become available in PDF.

* CAP 6 has been excluded from the package as it is the french language copy of CAP 5.  I will upload a copy of the French language publications by request only.

Additionally, if anyone knows of any sources of American or European publications that information would be greatly appreciated.
