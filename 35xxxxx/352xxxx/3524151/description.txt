This is a DVDrip of a VHS recording when this movie aired on the Sundance Channel.
The index file is corrupt, so it will not make a working DVD.  However, the 4 individual VOB files can be viewed with Video Lan Client (http://www.videolan.org).  The quality is not great, but this is the ONLY copy anyone has been able to get their hands on (it's never been released on DVD or VHS).
