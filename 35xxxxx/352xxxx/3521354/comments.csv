,smoochie,2007-09-01T02:44Z,"Attacking Furry Porn, or Anime Porn, or BDSM, or any sort of 'kink' porn, or gay/lesbian porn, or any fetish porn shows just how insecure in one's own sexuality one is. When we really open our eyes, we can then realize just what a minority there is who practice *quote*normal sex*quote*. You don't have to like it, but that doesn't make it wrong.

And if you think all Furry sex is gay, you're way the heck wrong. Furries are anthropromorphic representations of all of us, and so they too run the gamut of sexual preference. Unlike regular people, Furries often are more open about their sexuality and willing to try new things.

Oh yeah, and I'm not a Furry. You don't have to be a Furry to see it there way."
