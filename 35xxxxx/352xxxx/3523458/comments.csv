,corndog123,2006-09-17T13:08Z,"There actually is a working ps2 em, its called pcsx2 and you can google it for the home page, you need a bloody good vid-card though to run it at any decent speed, you'll still have to search for the bios though, suggest e-mule for that, always get emu's from the makers website cos most of the torrent em's are out of date or just spyware/ads"
