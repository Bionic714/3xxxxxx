Seeder, maybe??? 
What´s the point to release something that´s not going to get seed???"
,epoper,2006-09-11T07:38Z,Seed ffs.
,jeff mills,2006-09-11T07:42Z,"guys, be a bit patient and show respect for the people uploading. Its been available for 8 (!) minutes....
And by the way, its downloading just fine."
[T],yiuloan,2006-09-11T08:02Z,"@epoper 
If you don't know what superseed is, shut the fuck up. get your fucking files somwwhere else, shithead."
,Brimsgutten,2006-09-11T09:13Z,No swedish subs???
,epoper,2006-09-11T11:36Z,"yiuloan, i am doing that from another site ´cause you have a shithead and dont know anything. Fart you out. "
,rounder,2006-09-11T12:02Z,"yiuloan: thx for sharing this one! really appreciated. don't mind the sour grapes, becuase for every whining one you can count on that there are hundreds of us that are grateful for you file sharing."
,jerbe,2006-09-11T12:42Z,"Brimsgutten: Nope, no swedish subs on this one.  There is a version out with custom subtitles (swedish). It's called ""The.Da.Vinci.Code.2006.CUSTOM.SWESUB.DVDR-20620""
Will probably show up here any minute if it hasn't already."
,ursule,2006-09-11T13:49Z,"I think those who complained about the missing seeder didn't download this torrent (and of course didn't realize).
There was another torrent with the same name for some minutes, then it's been deleted and this one appeared.
I'm not writing this to justify those who complained, but maybe this can explain why they were not downloading."
,rounder,2006-09-11T14:20Z,"ursule: you might be right, but I think it was the usual misunderstandings: even if everything is working, it might take a while to connect to a tracker, especially if its under heavy load (as often is the case with TPB), or if its temporarily down.

and it takes even longer connecting torrents through DHT (trackerless). 

and on top of that then we also have all those possibilities with wrong settings at the users side and ISP problems, etc..."
