When it's uploaded with rar files, you have to extract it for it to become an img file, then you have to extract it again to get Video_TS, so I've just saved you time by uploading it like this..

Just burn it straight to a dvd, using Nero or what ever dvd maker you've got..."
,arnold1965,2006-09-08T22:37Z,"Please seed!!

I know that there are those who have 100%, so please don't just download and leave...
Seed for others as well, because I've uploaded 22 GB for this movie here, so it's out there somewhere..

I only upload until I see other that have got the movie, then I close mine down..

Please SEED!!!"
,arnold1965,2006-09-09T00:06Z,"There are other seeders that can take over so I've uploaded another movie by request..

,yz44,2006-09-09T05:29Z,"Thanks, easier in the \video_ts-format,

(what's to like about a rar-file?, strange and a little spooky don't ya think ;-)"

,TVLoafer,2006-09-17T14:33Z,"Hey arnold1965.. 
Not putting you down by saying that This movie Bites!
But, the movie does suck.

Your a great guy... The movie is lame, not you. So don't take offense, I'm just warning other people who might think they are downloading a movie worth seeing."
,just me,2006-09-18T22:46Z,"Big thanx to you arnold1965, good job"
,aztekkrille,2006-09-20T21:04Z,"Where is the DTS sound???

,HVPF,2006-09-21T10:29Z,"LOL @ TVLoafer 
He wrote the same when i first uploaded Hoodwinked back in June, that must be his mission in life.
No matter how much you ask em to seed 80% of the ppl who download stop the torrent after it's finished and leave us to keep on seeding.

,andsv585,2006-09-26T16:15Z,"När jag spelar upp skivan möts jag av en ""Välj språk""-menu. Dock, oavsett vad jag väljer så får jag ett ""Fel på skivan meddelande"". 

Jag har brännt samtliga filer till mappen VIDEO_TS. Dock utelämnade jag mappen Sample helt, men det kan väl inte spela någon roll? Eller?

Vad kan ha gått snett?
Tacksam för hjälp!"
[V],satmah,2006-09-29T01:08Z,"Hi, I did download this movie and when I use ShowTime or WinDVD, I do get a error message. I have not burnt this yet to a dvd disc. These programs couldnt read the movie. Do anyone get the same problem? Can any one help me to solve the problem? Thanks!"
,Teknokrat,2006-10-04T16:56Z,"wtf would anyone pay $40 to get access to anything readily available all over the net? Scam! Ppl making money off pirated stuff should be treated with tar and feathers (and that's the kind version).

This isn't really aimed @ arnold1965 but I'm glad TPB autoedits out links to sites who charge $ for pirated movies/software/whatever..."
,Chellam,2006-10-11T23:54Z,"hey, can someone please seed this? Please I would like to have the movie down before tomorrow evening.... I will keep seeding until a rate of atleast 1.5 ... which is aprox 6-7gb... comeon guys :)

cheers!"

I'm using Nero 7.
Shall I burn the folder with all the files or just the files"
,volvopista,2007-06-17T10:38Z,Kan nå´n hjälpa mig med info? Hur omvandlar jag denna Video-Ts till en DVD ?

,Akromion,2008-06-24T13:58Z,Der er da hverken dansk lyd eller undertitler på!!! Mine unger blev da meget skuffet. Jeg ved ikke om der også mangler noget på andre sprog. Jeg har iøvrigt brændt filmen med DVD Fab Platinum.

,Abe95,2009-10-21T10:24Z,"I use The Pirate Bay, because I can get free stuff. Guess what? To use this you have to burn it to a CD or something. CD's are not free, contrary to your suggested belief. Does MagicISO/Magicdisk work with this c***?"
