,Dr4000,2011-03-16T03:49Z,"""does this one have subtitles that you carnt take off like the your x-files season 1""

There aren't any hardcoded subtitles dude. Subtitles will automatically load with most media players, so either turn them off from within the player, or move them.

Subtitle files will end in either .sub or .srt and will usually be in the same folder as the video file itself."
