  Uploaders Notes:
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  -  First of all, please be patient when you download, I only have 1 Mbit up, 
     so I guess it will take a while. If it isnt fast enough for you, wait for
     another torrent or go elsewhere.

  -  For better download speed, make sure you have the correct ports open in your
     router and/or firewall. Visit http://www.portforward.com/ for more info.
     It also helps if you dont download other torrents at the same time.

  -  If you already have this game please help me with seeding! :)
