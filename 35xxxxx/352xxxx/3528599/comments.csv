,sputnik_1984,2006-09-30T08:19Z,how do I get sound on the game? I don't have sound when I started the game?
,Cobra_Venom,2006-10-05T18:10Z,"Run Monkey.exe from the first folder.
And setup your soundcard.
If you already have done that, choose change configuration in the meny. Don't start the game in their folders. Use the monkey.exe that's in the first folder."
,exterill,2007-04-08T16:00Z,this works... but it is a little bit too ol' school if you know what i mean. only sound from the speaker inside the computer. but thanx anyway!

,davidtheman,2008-01-29T18:47Z,"Does this work with Vista? I have Vista home premium, and when i try to run ''Monkey.exe' 'in the first folder and setup my sound and stuff, then try to launch any of the games, i get the error message ''This system doesnt support fullscreen''"
,Stack0verflow000za,2008-02-27T02:45Z,"those were the days, thanks"
,tibib,2008-03-02T12:41Z,I have the same question as davidtheman had. Does this games work on vista? Do you have to install som kind of program to make the games work? I really love monkey island:)
,rbaleksandar,2008-04-02T14:40Z,Those of you who ask if it works under Vista - yes. Just use the ScummVM and you'll have no problems :) btw I LOVE THIS GAME!!!

,b00gie_n1ghts,2008-06-11T11:04Z,"can anyone give me some help getting sound to work on windows? I have tried running the exe in the first folder, then chosen monkey island 1. - it says cannot find monkey1.ooo. so I moved the files from the monkey1 folder into the first folder and it still has the same error. It will run in ScummVM, but it has no sound. I tried the advice already given and it didnt work. I need sound!!"
,brizznown,2008-07-01T19:00Z,"If you're getting frustrated with not having music...consider downloading the torrent for Monkey Island Saga...it's a huge collection with all four games (and 3 editions of the first game) and tons of other junk, and audio works right after install. ;)

Btw it's easiest if you download it, burn the iso to DVD, and install from there.  But if you're brave, you can do the 'manual installation' thing for Curse of Monkey Island.  (It worked fine for me, since I installed the whole thing from a mounted drive, and made Curse's installed explode.  Hence the manual install procedure.)

,kerrydobi,2008-10-14T19:58Z,"Hey, I've read the info and downloaded ScummVM to play the games.  Thing is, I can't add the games to it no matter how much I look.  I've done the soundcard thing too.  And there isn't an option to 'open with' when I right click.  Anyone got any pointers?  REALLY NEED TO PLAY!"
,THEFUZZ08,2008-11-05T07:04Z,"cant get the sound to work,what do i putthesetting to in config?"
