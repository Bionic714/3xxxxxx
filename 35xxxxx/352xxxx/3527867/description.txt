Release Notes:

With Jay-Z out on the road touring everywhere from
the USA to the UK and from Poland to Kenya, his
Greatest Hits collection is released. The album
features the hits that made Jay-Z a household name
worldwide, such as his version of the classic Annie
song Hard Knock Life, his collaboration with the
late Notorious B.I.G., Brooklyn's Finest and his
Jermaine Dupri aided Money Ain't A Thing. After
releasing his Black Album Jay-Z announced his
retirement from rapping although he has been heard
on numerous guest appearances with songs such as
Beyonce's Deja Vu, and many speculate that a new
album could be on its way. But for the moment this
Greatest Hits collection should be enough to keep
you going!
