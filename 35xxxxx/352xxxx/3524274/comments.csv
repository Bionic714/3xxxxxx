,mikekearn,2008-06-21T11:26Z,"Worked fine, except updating via Internet doesn't work for me. I get a ""Product Not Registered with the Update Service"" error. Anyone know what to do? These older versions don't support my phone!"
,916casanova,2008-09-04T01:30Z,It won't let me update either. I have a LG VX9400 phone that wasn't in the list. Any tips?
,twincam88,2008-12-02T20:40Z,this program sucks.  even if you install just like your told it wil not update.  wants you to register but we all know (don't register something you didn't buy)!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
