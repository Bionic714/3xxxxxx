,Phatz0,2006-09-13T21:43Z,"@glufs:

Terrible comment, Spanish is a bigger language then English and faaaaaar more bigger then Swedish ey? It's a free world, just don't download it if you don't want it!!! Ignorant little prick..."
,speakeasy,2006-09-13T23:03Z,"Yeah, this *is* a site where pretty much anything goes.
If you want it, grab it, if you don't, look elsewhere."
,glufs,2006-09-14T00:08Z,"sorry then...

please help us make this place more spanish!"
,Weymaster,2006-09-14T05:30Z,"I'll help you making this place more ""spanish""!  ""Mucho gusto!"" ""Soy alergico a los crustaceos"" ""Tu mama es mi pollo"" ""No me sorprende que pienses de esa manera, siendo que eres gringo"" ""Ten un buen dia!"" ""Viste ese culo?"" ""Son puras cosas al azar""."
,miman2,2006-09-14T15:36Z,"Easy mungo! Since Piratebay is a swedish site with english as secondary language, it doesn´t make much sense uploading anything in other languages...
It´s like putting Björnes magasin in dvdquorum which I believe is a spanish site. Why this upload is somewhat annoying is that Appleseed is a great movie and tonimacarronis is commendable for sharing, it´s utterly useless in Sweden."
,badboyhaninge,2006-09-14T16:22Z,is spanish bigger than english i dont think! :)
,playmobilzurdo,2006-09-14T23:33Z,"I't pisses me off that some people have nothing better to do but to think they're better judges than myself when it comes to what ""makes sence"" uploading in this site. There's plenty of stuff in all kind of languages for you  alwaysleechneverseed motherfuckers to download! Try keeping this site a only-swedish area if you can! Go out and beat up some immigrants while you're at it, mongolic bitches!"
,Nagoual,2006-09-18T02:15Z,"If the piratebay is only Swedish us you said before why you have the option to choose us a language preferred any other language expect English?

Aragon bastards

,Marre666,2006-12-07T12:58Z,"Phatz0: answer to you stupid.

comment to the nerf that says spanish is bigger HOW COME ENGLISH IS FIRST LANGUAGE LEARNED IN SCHOOL GOSH what moron you are then..

some people say ignorence is a bliss but not this time.. nope. XD.

yaya speak up when you have something to say otherwis SHUTE THE HELL UPP NOOB if you dont know what the hell you are talking about...!
chinese would be better since a third of the earth population is chinese dooh that is just as smart as your words.. lol.

so change of subject do someone have this with japanese language and english subtitles?"
,kblood,2007-03-28T22:11Z,"Most spoken languages:
1. Mandarin (Chinese)
2. English
3. Hindi ... yea, guess they reproduce nearly as much as those chinese people
4. Spanish
5. Arabic

Thinking that Spanish is one of the most spoken languages is a understandable error, since just about all of Southamerica, Spain, parts of Northamerica and probably second language in parts of Africa since some of them migrates to Spain.

Still wouldnt be happy to see a mandarin torrent release here, just because there are lots of people who knows that language."
,AmyRose,2007-12-08T16:56Z,lol... wth spanish haha good this torrent is dead
