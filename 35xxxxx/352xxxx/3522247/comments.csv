,topbear,2007-10-14T17:51Z,"1) Thank you very much for uploading this wonderful film.
2) So sorry to sound like an idiot but how do I convert the files to a file I can watch with English subtitles... do I need any particular software?
MANY APOLOGIES in advance, you must hate posts like this it is just I have tried fiddling around with the individual files and am just making a mess of things.
THANKS
TBx"

,dilbertgeg,2009-06-26T05:44Z,"When I finally got back to this, I thought there was no Eng Subtitles. I went and DL some, then re-worked it using DVDFab6.  It crashes on making AVIs, but worked ok on Customize (DVD copy) allegedly adding Subs.

I wanted to hardcode the subs for standalone DVD player. I don't think mine will read an external ""sub"" file outside or inside the VIDEO_TS folder.

When I ck'd it again using free SMPlayer program instead of VLC, SMPlayer showed the Sub, VLC did not seem to find it.  (Both VLC and SMPlayer use their own sets of internal CODECs not system CODECs.  Both good.)

Not complaining, by the way, just feedback to other noobs.

Thanks, looks like an interesting flick!!!  Soon to see."
