my apologies for being slow to post the second part, I got caught up with work this morning.

Anyways, here's the second half - I'm super seeding again so if you spot any SEEDS then ban them as they're fake.

The second half was only about 2 hours in length, so total filesize is 2x CDs (1.4GB total).  This is the AUSTRALIAN DVB-T digital broadcast version."
