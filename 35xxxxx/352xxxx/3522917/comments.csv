,raindr0ps,2007-06-07T23:03Z,Bullshit! I downloaded this torrent over 6 months ago. It uses the Zinoku reader and it is in .exe format. Do google search for Zinoku. It  IS the best magazine reader I've ever used. I wish I could convert a lot of my .pdfs to Zinoku but it appears the site Zinoku.com.cn has been put out of business and there's no software out there to build the Zinoku reader format.
