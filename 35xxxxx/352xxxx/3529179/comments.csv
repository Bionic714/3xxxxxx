,JimBotox,2007-09-14T15:18Z,wheres the other discs 4 5
,JimBotox,2007-09-14T15:24Z,forget my last comment :-D
,jcvegas,2008-03-24T22:41Z,stuck at 99.7 % like everyone else anyone have a 100% ????
,teddytestus,2008-05-07T13:26Z,"yep, 99.7% too...
jms30, any chance of a full reseed please?"
,TWOBIOS,2010-05-13T13:27Z,"Yup ..  common consensus seems to be stuck at 99.7 percent .. and because its an iso  ( disk one and two are glitchy ones too)    we can't access any of the stuff until we get that last 0.3 percent .. 
So , come on mr uploader..   put it back on for 10 minutes .. and there will be 10 of us currently holding 99.7 percent who will happily seed your torrent .   I have a ratio of 6.!! on my 99.7    so .  please .. re-seed or else there will have been a great deal of bandwidth wasted.

Might be worth making an email adress.. and posting it on your future torrents ..   you could break it up   JMs30 at hotmail dot whatever.  
as ten poeple at least , would very much like to be able to nudge you into a re-seed"

,SailTrimmer62,2010-08-26T03:22Z,"Please... If anyone can seed this, I too am at 99.7%. 

Thank you."
