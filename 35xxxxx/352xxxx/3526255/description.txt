-TAGLINE-
	 I forget.

-WHAT THE BOX SAYS-
	With crime ruling the streets...and the police department out of control...there was no choice but to call the ""C.O.P.S."" ...a ruthless band of bounty hunters in the ""Civilian Operated Police State."" Action Superstar David Carradine electrifies the screen as John Tucker, the most powerful and feared of the ""C.O.P.S."" As leader of the city's ""future Force"" he stops at nothing to capture each bounty, but when murder and corruption are exposed within the organization, Tucker takes the law into his own hands. Armed with a bionic cannon and a .357 magnum, Tucker is the city's only hope for protection from its own band of mercenary killers.

-WHAT REALLY HAPPENS-
	I don't remember anything but a powerglove and some absolutely fucking rediculous everything.

-Notes-
Wow a year! One year ago today I made my first upload! While I haven't done anythgin in a long time,I figured I was mostly done, I saw that it had been a year and I did have this one lying around so I figured why not. I might upload things again in small amounts.

Its been a while since I've seen this one, its a holdover from months ago before I stopped uploading. So I'll just post this perfect review from IMDB.

"This is by the far the worst movie I have ever seen. It should be classified under comedy, because everything about it is a joke. Through the whole movie, we are supposed to believe that fat david carradine is the best cop of the future....give me a break. The whole time he's moving in slow motion and talks like John Wayne. He has some stupid electric glove that looks like that old nintendo glove. 
At one point he used a remote control to operate it that only had one big red button. Everytime he pushed that same big red button the glove would do something else like open the car door, punch, send out waves of energy and even give the old thumbs up. WOW!!!!

Besides the horrible acting, the cinematography was absolute garbage. Whoever edited this movie should never work in film again. Some of the scenes were just added in to take up time. I remember one scene where the chief of police was in his office just drinking a can of soda. THEY SHOWED HIM DRINKING THAT SODA FOR LIKE FIVE MINUTES!!! The car chases looked like they were looped to show the same scene over and over. Every once in a while they would throw in random cuts of David Carradine just walking around or aimlessly driving around town.

I don't have to tell you how ridiculous the story was. The whole time I was watching the movie me and my friend were laughing hysterically at how ridiculous everything in this movie was. I swear you could have given me ten bucks and a video camera and i could have made a better movie in my backyard.

I recommend every film teacher show this movie to their students to demonstrate to them how NOT to make a movie."
