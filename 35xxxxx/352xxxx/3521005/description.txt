If you liked the later [circa 1988-91] experimental albums of the band Talk Talk [and those albums are phenomenal], then this 1998 solo album by Mark Hollis will satisfy the craving for more.  Once again, exceptional in intensity, spirituality, and sheer musicianship, nothing else out there sounds quite like this, and it's amazing.
