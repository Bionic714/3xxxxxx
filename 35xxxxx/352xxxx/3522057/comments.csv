,sys-error,2006-09-11T04:59Z,"arnold1965 - say i downloaded a torrent and i want to add myself as a seeder. do i upload the .torrent to the site, then set the .torrent to seed in my client? 

also, where would i need to place the .torrent once seeding, in the directory of the files to seed or does it matter?

i've done little research, and only find the same info over and over again, with no reference to these questions."

,Highlander009,2008-06-04T07:26Z,half a dozen of us sitting at 94% !!!!   Someone came in with 99.6% last week (I'd settle for that if I could get it!) but never stayed long.  Can anyone PLEASE seed it???????
,Highlander009,2008-06-04T07:36Z,"@ oinz:

It shud play fine in VLC.  All the VOB files (& IFO + BUP files) will be inside a folder called ""VIDEO_TS"".   Simply Open VLC then drag that VIDEO_TS folder onto VLC.  The movie will then play like in any other DVD player (working Menus, etc. :)"
