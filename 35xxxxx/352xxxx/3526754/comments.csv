just becuase it is a small file doesnt mean its not a DVD-R movie. its small because theres only 2 episode on this DVD. why make it a DVD and not CD? who still gets CDs? and why would anyone want to put this on a CD? DVDs are VERY cheap and doesnt scrach like CDs do. 

as for this being in the wrong section, where would you like it to be in? this is a DVD and should be here ;)"
