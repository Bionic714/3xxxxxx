Thank you uploader, hopefully this is a good copy."

Whoever still has this copy, please be so kind as to seed this.
Currently my ETA is 2y7w.
That's 2 years!!!
Please boys and girls, please seed.
Thank you."

Is everyone here on this retarded??
A lot of people must have this, and that they can't seed until there's at least one more seeder to pass the torch, is disgraceful!!!! 
Can someone who has the full copy please seed 'till I have the full copy, and I will seed this bastard 'till the end of this year, that's a promise! Please, someone please seed this thing!"
,fieldof,2012-08-10T01:21Z,"@icing53 -  ""Retarded""?  ""Disgraceful""?  Those are words most appropriately applied to those who feel a sense of entitlement to free movies to the extent that they call others ""retarded"" and ""disgraceful"" rather than just go buy the DVD, which would support the people who worked to make the movie.  BTW, this DVD is probably quite inexpensive considering the movie came out in 1990."
