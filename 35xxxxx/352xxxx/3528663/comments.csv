Cant even play ogg on my stationary dvdplayer...so for me ogg equals SHIT!"
,Ollan83,2006-09-26T17:50Z,Mp3 is not a free format.
,XONi49,2006-11-28T15:44Z,it might not be a free format but there are a shit load of free programs that will convert them to mp3 all the same shit even musicmatch will still let you do mp3 if you dont buy it
,Ollan83,2006-12-14T09:29Z,"Well. If u don't like OGG, don't download it."
,LubosD,2007-03-24T21:38Z,"MP3 sucks - it's non-free and quality is bad.

Thanks for using OGG Vorbis."
