i got E01-E21
what season am i in please?"
,wolverine_matt,2006-10-03T18:52Z,"ShibbyDK:

There are 23 episodes in the 1st series, but they have been split up on DVD releases, (and there was quite a gap in broadcast dates between episodes 7 and 8) so the first 23 episodes are often quoted as S1E1-7 and S2E1-16).

So this episode is the 24th episode."
