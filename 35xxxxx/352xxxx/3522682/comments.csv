Thanks"
,clpombo,2009-04-16T17:10Z,Please seed this movie again. This is the only torrent of cape fear in DVD I found. 
,nessl,2010-02-27T17:40Z,"I'm begging dvdquorum to upload this again.

This film is a masterpiece and it very rarely gets shown on TV in Europe these days. Also, it is usually sold on DVD in a bundle with Martin Scorsese version which most people actually don't need. 

So please dvdquorum, reseed this movie agian and thus do the favour to film culture in general.

Thanks"
