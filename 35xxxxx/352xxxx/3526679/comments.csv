,Osaka,2006-11-14T20:39Z,"Can't make what work?

The torrent or the screenshots? The screenshot links doesn't work anymore, but the torrent should, as long as there are seeders."
,virre_one,2006-11-15T22:20Z,"it doesnt work, not in vlc or media player"
,Osaka,2006-11-16T00:58Z,"It's in H.264 format, your computer may not be powerful enough to play H.264 video.

Try this player:

It's very fast and needs very little CPU power.
MPlayer is very good for H.264 videos.

The film works fine on my computer in both VLC and MPlayer, and also in Media Player Classic (thats NOT Windows Media Player!)"
,virre_one,2006-11-17T10:48Z,"nice...i tried  Media Player Classic ,,
like a glove,, thx man"
,Chryslerdude,2007-03-30T00:16Z,"Heres a little WARNING TO MOPAR LOVERS... As you might expect, they kill a white R/T Challenger at the end, and I was prepared and expecting that, but as a little extra STUPID Hollywood spice, why not flip over a beautyful black 68 Charger on the roof.... Seriously.. what the F*** is up with all that Charger-flipp'in...? Quality (picture) is FINE, but Viggo's otherwise good talent is wasted in this ""just another pointless Charger-crusher movie"". (and girl in desert has her top on here in 97... whats up with that?) THANKS to Osaka !!!"
,redhammer,2007-04-14T22:34Z,This is the one that`s good xD
,OzExcalibur,2007-07-18T09:20Z,Why the hell would you encode it in MKV? not many people watch movies on their PC and it is hard to convert it and burn it to DVD
,Osaka,2007-07-23T11:46Z,"Um... you don't ""encode to MKV""...

.MKV is merely a container, just like .AVI or .MP4.

The actual video is in H.264, and you do NOT store H.264 in an .AVI container.. it's simply the way it's done, it's wrong and creates problems.

You normally store H.264 streams in .MP4 containers, but then you also use AAC sound.

Since I didn't use AAC sound for this rip, I did not store it in MP4. Instead, I used MKV -- which is perfectly OK for AVC/H.264 content.

I used H.264 (the encoder I used was the open-source x264 codec) because it looks much better than XviD or DivX, and compresses much better also. If I would have used XviD instead, the file size would have ended up well over 2,5 GB if I wanted it to look as good as it does now.

If you want to convert it to .VOBs (DVD format), you'd first have to extract the video and audio streams with MKVextractGUI.exe that comes with MKVtoolnix... then repack it into an .MP4 with YAMB.

Then use some random program to ""convert"" it to ""DVD format"". I wouldn't rely on Nero for everything if I were you...

Also, just go to the forums at doom9 if you ever need any help with anything concerning video or if you want to learn how stuff works. It's a great place."

,nizzos,2007-10-02T04:06Z,check this out if you look in the original its a 67 firechicken on its roof 
,b1oware,2008-01-29T23:02Z,can you convert directly this movie to dvd with convert x to dvd program...or any else....???
[T],bozano,2008-02-15T06:27Z," If i burn this on a dvd it will play on a desk dvd without problem, or i need a home theather or something else?"
,zeinabqureshi,2008-03-30T18:44Z,"Not planning to d/l this one, but agree totally with *Osaka* regarding H.264 and using MKV to store it. Nothing comes close to MKV in small filesize and quality and sound. So, you have no other options. Plus, if you really want, you can include the subs (as many of them as you want) with the file itself, so it's a lot cleaner, elegant.

Thanks for sharing. Do watch the classic original, please do."

,rrpostal,2008-09-24T14:49Z,"I understand all the comments by videophiles about MKV being the ""proper"" and better way to do it. But many of you fail to realize, or simply are providing it for others like yourself (which is fine), is that a great many of us have standalone DVD player nowadays that handle lots of video (DivX etc), but not MKV. I have at least three, including in my car that will play AVI and the quality is ""good enough"" for people without discerning tastes and I can fit several movies per DVD. Unless it's a great movie worthy of HD, I won't waste the time and effort with anything else.

Not trying to be a jerk, it's just that's why I skip MKV unless it's all I can find, and probably why the angry comments. It may just be another case of where the better tech didn't win the popularity war."
,rrpostal,2008-09-24T14:51Z,"Oh yeah, thanks also for the movie, I didn't even realize there was a remake."
[V],maestral,2008-11-24T14:24Z,in this picture format it has nothing to do with real mkv. mkv is mainly made to support high resolution monitors above 1024*768 or 1280*760 if its widescreen.
[V],maestral,2008-12-01T00:28Z,can somebody RERAPE this thing to divx??? so normal people can watch the movie with no sound delay. THANX
[V],maestral,2008-12-02T00:23Z,"DIVX FORMAT, SAME VIDEO QUALITY. ITS NOT TAKEN FROM THIS ONE. I find fresh version of it.

[V],maestral,2008-12-05T12:55Z,"THIS THING IS LOW RESOLUTION DIVX FORCED TO MKV TO TRICK PEOPLE WITH HDs LIKE I HAVE. IF U TRY TO RIP IT BACK TO DVD OR DIVX YOU'LL HAVE AUDIO DELAY, SO YOU CAN ONLY WATCH THIS ON MKV SUPPORTING DVD PLAYER OR ON YOUR COMP. 
768x576 -- THATS BIG WAAAAAAY FROM MKV OR HD RESOLUTION, YOU'LL GET TRIMMED VIDEO WHEN U WATCH IT."
,Ouzotime,2009-05-13T17:01Z,after reading imdb results along with the mkv part i will pass but i did dl the original and a good copy it is i also agree with what rrpostal wrote..cheers to all
