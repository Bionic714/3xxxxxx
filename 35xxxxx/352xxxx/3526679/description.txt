The (not so good compared to the original) 1997 TV-remake of Vanishing Point, starring Viggo Mortensen.

Movie format is H.264, encoded with x264.
Audio format is MP3, encoded with LAME.
Container is MKV.

Video resolution is high: 768x576.

Suggested player for use: VLC Media Player or MPlayer.

It will play smoothly even on slow computers, because CABAC, Deblocking and other advanced features in the x264 encoder was turned off before encoding it, so very little CPU power is required to play it.
