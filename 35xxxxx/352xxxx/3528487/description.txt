Bug Juice was Disney Channel's original reality series about real kids at summer camp. It premiered in 1998 and lasted until 2002, with a total of three seasons. The show featured a different U.S. summer camp every season. Every episode features the struggles real kids go through with each other and themselves, and chronicled their friendships, fights, loves, breakups, makeups, and self-discoveries. After the show ended, it remained on as reruns, next to Disney's series, So Weird. Eventually, it left the airwaves and didn't return until the summer of 2004 as part of Disney Channel's new summer lineup.
