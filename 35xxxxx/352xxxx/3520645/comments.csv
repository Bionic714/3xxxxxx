,cytalis,2007-10-17T16:54Z,"to ward26:

Are you completely retarded?
Never used torrents before? 
You must have even the sleightest clue what to do with it.....
You need a torrent program such as uTorrent, Bitlord or BitComet or similair that handles torrent files. After downloaded one of theese you simply open the file and download the shite.

If you still don't understand I suggest that you try finding a torrent guide or something...or GTFO"
,Storken123,2007-12-14T16:56Z,can u play this with your keyboard??
,Manhax,2007-12-25T20:05Z,Thanks for uploading. This pack is genious!
,icet87,2008-01-21T11:09Z,"Thanks for the awesome upload! Once you get everything set up, It's quite fun. Harder than actual Guitar Hero, IMO."
,nativetrash,2008-02-18T00:58Z,"For fuck sakes,
It's Infected by BAD RELIGION, not black sabbath
good torrent though"
,dhuman3000,2008-04-17T07:42Z,"Hmm, not working for me...

When I try to extract it, it won't let me.
It tells me something like it's an unknown source or something.
I'll try re-downloading it."
,daneraw,2008-09-09T23:04Z,"needs a password, I am not seeing it."
,daneraw,2008-09-09T23:38Z,OpenDNS wont let me go to the link page.
,Boemeister,2009-02-05T19:57Z,"To open the files, download WinRAR and extract it to the folder ( ""C:\program files\FretsOnFire\data\songs"" this is standard i think).

The official site free 30 days: http://www.rarlab.com/rar/wrar380.exe

Or the Piratebay one(use this one of course):
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4505441/WinRAR_3.80_Professional

One can never be too precise! (or mabye u can) but anyways this should solve your problem! :)"
,jax6661,2009-03-25T21:05Z,"Kiitos - Tuntematon :D
Toimii täydellisesti ;)

Thank u Tuntematon
works perfect! :p

For those who don't know what to do:

1 : Download the file
2 : Unzip the winrar file to C:\program files\frets on fire\data\songs (or wherever u installed the game)
(3) : for those who doesn't have winrar, goto http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm and download ur language.
4 : ROCK ON!! :D"
