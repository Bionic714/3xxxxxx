,MayorSlack,2006-09-12T02:33Z,"This is a dvd of all the os's listed.
XP home OEM, Retail
XP PRO OEM, Retail, Volume License
etc....

It also has 'burn stand-alone ISO' of each, as well as a 98 command prompt with NTFS."
,leonardo2005,2006-09-13T01:59Z,"As far as I can see, in all of those RAR archives, there is only 2 ISO files. ISO for CD1 and ISO for CD2. Also, it says it is the upgrade version of Media Center with SP2, so, that means: it can be run on existing Win XP.

So where are the other ISOs?"
,MayorSlack,2006-09-15T01:23Z,"mount the mdf and burn the DVD-

This is a bootable dvd as well as autorun in windows.
It has SP2 for ALL - Not real complicated, pretty much the same as the 8 in 1 sp1 and the 9 in 1 sp2.
This 11 in 1 has MCE 2005 and Tablet as well as the ability to make stand alone ISOs for each OS."

I hacked it and changed your port forwarding to dissallow port 80 from 192.168.1.1 to the internet. PLEASE do not do this again! I am nice but many other on the net are not!! if you are going to allow the port 80 from 192.168.1.1 AT LEAST change your config password."
