Type/Genre...:  Concert

Description:  Recorded live at Radio City Music Hall on April 1, 2006, this concert is the culmination of the band's 20th Anniversary Tour, featuring two full sets and over 30 tracks.

Rippers Notes:  This is an amazing concert.  Unfortunately, its 2:44 long.  The PCM audio track was just way to big to include.  It takes up about 1/3 of a DVD5.  The DD 5.1 track was transcoded from 448 kb/sec to 384 kb/sec to give as much space as possible to the video.
Average bitrate for the whole DVD is 3318 kb/sec.  Chapters are in their proper places. This was packed with WinRar 3.60.

Ripped: Menus, all audio tracks except DD 5.1, subtitles

Enjoy
