,derwood,2006-09-25T05:57Z,"I've been seeding now for about 22 hours since I uploaded the torrent.. I'm in super-seed mode, so you may not see me listed in the swarm, but I assure you, I am there.
The highest leech in the list has 62.6 percent.  I've uploaded 3.88 gig so far. 
Any help I can get seeding will be appreciated.. I've never uploaded a DVD before :)"
,Flu_And,2006-09-25T20:33Z,"Thanks a lot for this DVD, derwood.
I have downloaded it and will seed for at least three days."
,Venerdi,2006-09-26T23:10Z,"thx, but...    no menus    :-("
,derwood,2006-09-27T01:43Z,"Menus on this DVD took up 526 megs.
With this being almost 3 hours long, the bitrate was way to low to begin with.
If you want menus and extras buy the thing."
,Clapton,2006-09-27T23:59Z,"Thanks Derwood! This is an awesome concert!! The best I've ever seen of Dream Theater...They all play so great. Petrucci and specially Jordan Rudess are impressive. Portnoy is totally crazy in here, he is the soul of this band. Without his enthusiasm Dream Theater will not be DT :-) 
Could you please seed a menu and extras version? Thanks!! "
,Venerdi,2006-09-28T00:31Z,"derwood, thanks the same one...   :)"
