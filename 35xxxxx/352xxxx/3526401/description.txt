This is a video demonstration of how you can play DOOM (Ultimate, Final and classic), DOOM II, HERETIC and HEXEN in a new and exiting environment, with ehncanced graphics, dynamic lighting, halos, volumetric smoke, new hud options, true 3D environment and weapons, and much more. It comes with options to install several addons like new graphics, models, texrtures, so you can extend your long-aged DOOM experience still for a long time..... ;)
