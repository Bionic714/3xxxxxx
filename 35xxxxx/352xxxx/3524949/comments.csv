If anyone has Repair manual of Chevrolet G20 example Haynes then please share."
,m2c,2006-09-16T14:09Z,I'm glad if i can help other USA car enthusiasts in their hobby. You probably need a book to rehaul the transmission like http://www.haynes.co.uk/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?catalogId=10001&storeId=10001&productId=14751&langId=-1 or the ATSG manual. But the video is still great help.
