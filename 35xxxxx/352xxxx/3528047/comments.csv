,enick,2006-09-23T19:26Z,Just because its going on a break doesn't mean its a season finale. Its just the half season cliffhanger...
,damionofdeleroy,2006-09-23T23:27Z,"Hey, this is a thanx from canada. we only get the space channel and would have to wait till november to get these! I'm a real Stargate fam, but only stargate sg1. I'm not a fan of the atlatis series. I want to kill them for canceling the series. It was just getting interesting.
Well, thanx again!"
