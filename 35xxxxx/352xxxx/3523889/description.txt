Danny Elfman has written soundtracks (Batman et al.) for the last decade, so it's no surprise he's ditched the hyperkinetic pop of the Oingo Boingo era for more mature, long-form epics in reviving his old band. Most people will run screaming from Elfman's intensity and dense wordplay, but the emotional depths plumbed by tracks like "Can't See" (Useless) and the 16-minute fever dream "Changes" ensure cult acclaim. --Jeff Bateman
