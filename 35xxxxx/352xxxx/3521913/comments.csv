,gasman364,2006-09-10T14:57Z,I don't suppose anyone has Acronis Universal Restore that allows you to restore an image to a different machine with different hardware?  Has anyone tested this feature if they have found it?
,Rexxxifon,2006-09-15T06:58Z,"I've searched for the Universal Restore, and the copies I've found, tell me Acronis isn't installed.  Anyone have a working copy? I'd like to get this as well."
,uraphake,2006-09-18T09:02Z,"According to the Acronis site: ""Install the Acronis Universal Restore option. Please note that Acronis True Image 9.1 must be licensed and installed for Acronis True Image Universal Restore to function.""
A working version of that implementation would be most welcome indeed!"
,Rexxxifon,2006-09-18T23:41Z,"Gee, thanks for stating the obvious."
,gasman364,2006-09-20T06:07Z,"Hell, I can't even find out if this Universal Restore thing even works at all!  Anyone even seen a proper review of it?"
,uraphake,2006-09-21T01:13Z,"The ""obvious"" here is that this version with a keymaker lacks that which is necessary for Universal Restore to be installed. While all other functions in this release may work, it is still not a complete crack when it reports that Acronis is not even installed. In short, if you're looking to use Universal Restore, then pass on this torrent. In short...""Gee, you are welcome."""
,Rexxxifon,2006-09-21T23:14Z,"Thanks Sigmund for the analysis, but nowhere did I state that the keymaker works for Universal restore. So your comment is moot.  Scroll up and see where Universal Restore was said to be working with this torrent?  I stated ""Acronis True Image Workstation v9.1.3718 Includes Keymaker"" And that's it.

And BTW, I found the Latest version of Acronis TrueImage Enterprise Server, and Universal Restore works awesome with that.  I tried it out with a backed up Image from my main system, and restored it onto a secondary computer, which was completely different, and it worked awesome."
,Todde@Swe,2006-12-26T17:59Z,Does this version work to install without any request of a .dll file that can't be found anywhere... ? :)
,felix222,2006-12-27T09:36Z,"Hi all
Can I restore RAID disks with this tool?
"
,felix222,2006-12-27T09:39Z,With the old Acronis (it was Acronis 7 maybe) I didnt see my RAID disks when I was  booting with Acronis CD. 
,acheron72,2007-04-14T23:48Z,"Workstation v9.1.3887 and Universal Restore v9.1.3887 can both be found in the following...

They seem to work together; so if you are looking for Universal Restore, that is the best bet for now."
