,vegeto222,2008-07-25T20:22Z,"Nvm... I was so stupid that I didn't plug in my earphones 

*bonehead*"
,oggign,2008-08-01T02:45Z,"This one is not truely HD, just a DVD upscaled to HD resolution. 
The Advent Children HD will be released as ""Final Fantasy VII : Advent Children Complete"" on the Blu-ray Disc in 2008"
,Szimen,2008-08-17T20:21Z,"because a DVD doesn't have enough capacity for full HD quality movie - This download is small enough for a dvd because it's compressed in XviD, but in raw format you need a larger storage media, e.g. Blu-ray
try thinking before speaking, or just f*in google it."
,maxkill,2008-09-14T22:00Z,"Hej jag har gjort ett försök att för första gången ladda upp en subtitle på svenska till denna filmen med justerad timing så att text tal stämmer...
(kan ej lova att det funkar men borde funka..)

SVENSK SUBTITLE:
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4395974"
,crazyteknohed,2008-10-29T08:55Z,"To anybody who is interested, this film plays quite well using XBMC on an Xbox 1 and looks beautiful. The only problem is that the subtitles are not being played whenever the DVDplayer core is used, and playback is to slow using the Mplayer core. If anyone figures out a workaround please let us know. Also, I had to split the file in two to overcome the 4gb file limitation."
,crazyteknohed,2008-10-29T08:58Z,"And to those naysayers (oggign, I'm looking at you) who are saying that this isn't in HD please download the file before throwing around accusations. There is no f*cking way that this is upscaled material. Only a blind fool would think that this is not an HD rip - it looks f*cking amazing!"
,crazyteknohed,2008-11-01T10:19Z,"English subs:

,oggign,2008-11-06T05:13Z,"@crazyteknohed: No offence, but plz consider this fact before you swear : How the hell can a HDrip be available if the HD source is not exist?
Check this link, dude : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy_VII_Advent_Children (go to Special Editions section).
And let's face it, although this realease look amazing compared to DVD quality, there's a long long way ahead compared to a real HD quality. Just check out Cars or Kung Fu Panda realeases in 720p or 1080p, the differences are clearly visible.
BTW, thanks to the uploader, though I didn't download this."
,black_buster,2008-11-26T17:05Z,"the subs don't match with the audio, how do i configure the delay? i'm using vlc and mplayer (classic player)"
,bumjeans,2008-12-13T13:00Z,"Looking at the caps, upscale was the first thing which came to mind.  Heard theres a super Blu Ray on its way next year though."
,devious_mind,2008-12-30T19:45Z,Please seed the subtitle!
,crazyteknohed,2009-01-05T09:58Z,"Oggin, it's quite simple - an HD rip can exist without the HD source apparently exisiting in the same way that all th axxo DVD rips exist without the DVD sources existing. People here seem so have the means for obtaining the unobtainable.

Besides, this release is an HDTV rip, not BR/HD-DVD rip, so I don't see where your argument is? I can see why you are arguing that it's an upscaled DVD as the caps are a bit crap. But hey, I can't force anyone to download this, nor do I care if they do or don't, I just wanted to vouch for the uploader. Some of us appreciate the work they do ;)"
,rbin,2009-03-07T12:08Z,"Its an Upscaled because the maximum resolution of a dvd is 720X480 & the Blu-Ray which is in 1080p is not yet out & haven't seen any BDRip, 

Well if you have it already Rip it and please this time in H264(X264) Loss less Codec in a REAL 1280X720 (720p) Resolution"
,Yeroff,2009-04-08T17:55Z,"Just saw it and it's not HD, it has high resolution but the quality is no better than the DVD, thanks anyway"
,Blackpegasus,2009-05-07T19:09Z,"It's not so bad!
Would be better with mpg+H264, encode, but this is an old release...

And it's not a plain upscaled DVD!
It's graphic is greatly improved!!! (But the movie itself is upscaled).

If you are a fan, I say get this!

I have the H264 DVD version, which look like ""cleaner"" (because H264), but this one is ""nicer"" (better graphic).

@Osaka: please, if you can, make a H264 version of this HDTV rip!
(I like this older version better, than the new ""Complete"" blue-ray version).

And thanks for the upload!"
,ultaman1,2010-02-05T11:53Z,Does this download works on ps3?..
,Gotpwnage520,2011-08-28T06:30Z,Is this in English becuz i'm seeing a lot of comments linking to english subs
