-->> Advent Children in HDTV format: 1280x720. <<--

The video is XviD, the audio is the original AC3 sound (5.1 surround), and it's all in an .AVI container. I suggest use VLC or MPlayer.

I was going to put up some sample screenshots, but last time I tried that, imageshack didn't seem to like it and disabled the hotlinking to them.

It's rather big, about 4,16 GB, but that's still a pretty small size considering it's High-Definition, and the res is 1280x720 (also known as 720p).

..............Since my upload rate is not extremely fast..............

---------------------------------

I'm giving you links to the sample screenshots anyway, but I have no idea if it will work or for how long. It doesn't hurt to try, right? 

Please keep in mind that they are in .jpg format, so the quality of the screenshots are not the exact same as that of the movie, which is a lot better, especially when you see it in motion.

Highlight it then copy and paste into address bar.
