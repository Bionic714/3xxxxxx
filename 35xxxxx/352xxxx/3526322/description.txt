The debut release of Calle 13 in late 2005 offered a refreshing alternative to the mass of reggaeton then dominating the urban side of Latin music. Comprised of el Residente (vocalist/songwriter) and Visitante (producer/musical arrangements), Calle 13 employ elements of reggaeton, specifically the beats and rhythms produced by Visitante. Plus, they\\\\\\\'re from Puerto Rico, which is ground zero for reggaeton. Yet the these guys don\\\\\\\'t follow the standard template for reggaeton any further than that. The music is quite diverse, employing hip-hop and Latin dance elements as well, and el Residente raps in a colorful style that borders on singing at times. Moreover, his lyrics are witty and humorous, if still urban in character and fixated on women as sexual objects. A few songs stand out, notably \\\\\\\"Se Vale To-To\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\"¡Atrévete Te, Te!\\\\\\\" Too, there are a number of skits interspersed throughout the album, and they\\\\\\\'re just as much fun as the music. So if you like the urban side of Latin music yet feel put off by the machismo of reggaeton, Calle 13 offer a refreshing alternative. The beats are here, as is the rapping, and you can dance to it, except the emphasis of this duo seems to be wit and creativity rather than cashing in on the reggaeton gold rush with the same old staple motifs. ~ Jason Birchmeier, All Music Guide
