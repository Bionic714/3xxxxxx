,DaftHonk,2006-09-20T01:39Z,"Glad to be of service.  I pulled these rips of of Usenet, and will be posting each region as I finish it.  A good terrain mesh such as this should hold us over until the release of FSX.  Looks like they use a much better mesh in the new version - not to mention new textures and autogen.  But it appears FSX may not be out until Christmas now. :(

Oh well, until then enjoy the mesh.  I'm thinking of combing it with Ultimate Terrain / BirdsEyeView / Ground Environment Pro.  I'll get back to everyone on my results."
,David-7237,2006-09-20T01:45Z,"hey, I have got UT Canada/USA installd.. do they harm FS Globle?"
,ANW14,2006-09-20T03:27Z,"@David no this is only mesh, meaning that it only affects the levels in which the ground rises and falls. (Like mountains)"

,DaftHonk,2006-09-20T23:14Z,"I do plan to add more continents.  I have South America and Europe ready to go, Oceana downloading and Africa queued up.  Unfortunately, the copy of Asia I found is not quite complete so I have to see if I can find the extra parts.
Each continent will be uploaded once there are sufficient seeds from the previous."
