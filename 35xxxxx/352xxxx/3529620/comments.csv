,raindr0ps,2007-06-09T17:04Z,I downloaded this torrent months ago. It uses the Zinoku reader and it is in .exe format. Do google search for Zinoku. It IS the best MAGAZINE reader I've ever used. I wish I could convert some of my other .pdf mags to this format but it appears the site Zinoku.com.cn has been put out of business and there's no software out there to build the Zinoku reader format.
