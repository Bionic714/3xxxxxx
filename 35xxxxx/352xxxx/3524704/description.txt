Synopsis:

Legendary, late comedian Bill Hicks was just
starting to gain critical mass when he passed
away in 1994. A comic's comic Hicks was dedicated
to stand-up as the be-all-end-all, not a stepping
stone to a flaccid sitcom. This DVD showcases
his incredible live act with Hicks assaulting the
stage and his audience with a non-stop cornucopia
of hilarious insights into our twisted world; the
government, the military, the police, religion,
smoking, pornography, drugs and, of course, for
those of you who are getting antsy, a couple of
dick jokes.
