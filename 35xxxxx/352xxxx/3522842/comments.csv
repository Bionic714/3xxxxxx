,psycosteve,2008-09-12T14:35Z,CDisplay ZIP Archived Comic Book File .CBZ  is a renamed .ZIP file and can be decompressed with any .ZIP file utility. The CDisplay program displays the comic book images so it is useful to use for this particular .ZIP archive type. its a free and easy program to use if your into manga or comics . 
,sillyscrewy,2009-08-30T06:24Z,Good stuff. I liked Larry Hama's stories in GI Joe. I did think it was weird though that he gave the Night Creepers the names from the Hebrew alphabet. Jewish ninjas?!?
