,ottolunch,2008-02-22T05:00Z,"BEWARE!! Ad-aware 2007 found Win32.Trojan.Agent in the Autodesk AutoCAD 2006 folder. This is the same program that the ""Readme 1st.txt text document tells you to install FIRST!!
In the mean time, I advise everyone to download Ad-aware from Lavasoft (it's free). Install it and run it in full scan."
