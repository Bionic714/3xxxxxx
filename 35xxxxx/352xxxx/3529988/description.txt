Back in the old  days you could remove  the vocal from a  stereo track by
subtracting the left channel from the right.

  * You only got mono output,

  * The bass was missing,

  * The mix sounded terrible,

  * You could only remove the vocal, not isolate it,

  * It only really worked on old tracks, before they started using stereo
  reverb.

Voice trap offers two sophisticated DSP algorithms: 

  * FFT-based center channel suppression / isolation,

  *  Cepstral  liftering  (an   advanced  technique  that  can   identify
  harmonically rich elements in a mix).

Together these allow Voice Trap to overcome those problems:

  * The output is stereo,

  * The bass frequencies are left untouched,

  * The mix is largely preserved,

  * You can choose to remove the vocal OR isolate it,

  * Good results possible on some modern tracks (ie, with stereo reverb).
