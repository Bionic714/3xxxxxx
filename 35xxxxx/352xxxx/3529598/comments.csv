,pmfabri,2011-02-01T00:49Z,"Quality sucks dick. Instead of stuffing the torrent full of shit samples and trailers, do a higher bit rate next time."
,michaelrwatson,2012-04-14T11:30Z,"HELLLOOOO....... Dow anyone know if this has English subtitles for the Russian parts? 

Those are key to the story, so unless you speak Russian, no point in watching w/o those subs."
,michaelrwatson,2012-04-14T21:15Z,@pmfabri: You're a moron too. The rip is 700 MB as it should be. You don't have to download the other files unless you're using the lamest torrent app on the planet. 
,michaelrwatson,2012-04-15T22:57Z,"Okay, downloaded it and it *does* have hardcoded English subs for the Russian parts. Good job, r0d3nt!
