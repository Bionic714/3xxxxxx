,shiny_,2006-09-09T04:26Z,Any seeders out there?  Everyone seems stuck at ~11%
,itBme,2006-09-27T04:56Z,There seems to be a seeder that helps out every once in a while.  We are now at 51.8%.  Are there anymore?  At this rate we won't finish for another couple of weeks/months.  :(
,Zetoss,2006-10-08T15:24Z,"Looks like the site thinks this pack has been downloaded 17 times already... I find that very hard to believe, because nobody had more than a few % for days, and there has only been a single seed showing up every now and then... Now the total bunch of downloaders have crawled a few % per week only to now get stuck at 99,7% so how about you mysterious savior help us and seed for just another day, pleeeaaase? :/"
,itBme,2006-10-08T23:35Z,2 x 8MB blocks left to seed.  Pleeeez?!?  There are about 45 of us that are stuck @ 99.7% so all you need to do is send them out once and we'll continue to pass them around.  :)
