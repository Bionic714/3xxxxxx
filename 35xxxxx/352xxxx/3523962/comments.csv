,jimmychan,2006-09-14T14:31Z,yes vote democrat I guess.  lesser of 2 evils.
,flamesong,2006-09-14T16:07Z,"Vote Democrat???

It's like being given the option of having whipped cream squirted around your mouth whilst the devil rams a glowing poker up your arse.

Republican/Democrat - Conservative/Labour - two arse cheeks of the same corporate whore.

Ain't yous learn'd nuttin'!"
,kanye,2006-09-14T18:05Z,"not voting is almost as stupid as voting bush!
the us only has these 2 options, the others not play a role at all"
[T],BhangWalla,2006-09-14T18:28Z,"parliamentarism or a constitutional republic is NOT the end of the century old democratic process. why should it be? not voting is a way to spread that message. how is it democratic when 49% of the people continually get turned down?
so called representative democracies have one thing in common - not representing the minorities at all."
[T],BhangWalla,2006-09-14T18:32Z,"It is a catch-22 situation. The government, in order to maintain democracy, must keep people voting. But the campaigns are so shallow and dumbed-down for the masses that the issues actually being voted for are irrelevant to the what the politicians want to do. So, only a shallow, almost fake, democracy is upheld. The problem is that the people (including myself of course) do not understand deeper issues, the trends or complexities of society, and that no society has come up with a way of effective mass-education to a good standard. Politicians themselves rarely understand what they are doing. Bush is the ultimate example! So go ahead - vote!"
,flamesong,2006-09-15T00:17Z,"Democracy?

What the fuck are you talking about?

First, look the word up in a dictionary.

Second, try to apply that definition to what amounts to a five yearly poll on which of two corporate sponsored parties between whom you could not pass a cigarette paper.

In the UK, the process is further diluted by the division of constituencies and the 'first past the post system' which effectively disenfranchises the majority of voters.

In the US, the so called electoral college is even more risible whereby winner takes all, state by state. Only the wealthiest can survive.

These systems are both designed to perpetuate a non-competitive two party dictatorship in which minority views are rarely, if ever represented.

Even if one accepts that Bush did not win either of his election, which is widely believed, the electorate do not in reality vote for him. Furthermore, not one member of the Bush administration is an elected representative - they were all appointed (ostensibly) by Bush.

And you call that democracy."

,I_Rule,2006-09-15T10:09Z,"In what way are the democrats better than  the republicans? The democrats are NOT against the war, in fact they claim that they are going to fight it ""better"" than the reps. Recently John Kerry and Bill Clinton in separate speeches said that they need to send more troops to Iraq to quench the Iraqi resistance. How democratic is that?

@ Knaster:

Yeah, we saw how much good national socialism did for Germany. 12 years after Hitler had come to power half of Germany lay in smoking ruins and a good part of its population were dead. There is a thing called history, its good, read some."
,rectalragingfungus,2006-09-15T10:40Z,DEMOCRACY SUCKS! HAILS MONARCHY!
[T],Knaster,2006-09-16T14:44Z,I_Rule you dumb fuck Nationalsocialism doesnt automatically mean world domination and WW3. Read history youself cause i think you need it. Hitler was a maniac but nationalsocialism saved germany before ww2.
