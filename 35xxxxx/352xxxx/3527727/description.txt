Super Bowl X was one of the classic matchups in Super Bowl history. Chuck Noll's Pittsburgh Steelers were back again, this time against Tom Landry's Dallas Cowboys. The game featured two of the games greatest quarterbacks in Terry Bradshaw and Roger Staubach, and two of the best defenses in the league.
