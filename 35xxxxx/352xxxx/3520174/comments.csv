(I haven't burned the files and am running the install by initially clicking on monkey.exe)

Thanks."

,Thai-N!sse,2006-12-27T02:16Z,"Why doesn't it work? when i mount cd1 it says :

""Setup requires_SETUP.DLL and _ISRES.DLL (located in SETUP.LIB) in order to work properly.Please ensure these files are located wirh SETUP.EXE""

Please help,i really want this game !!"
,Leslie_lizzard,2007-01-16T20:20Z,"Here's how you do... get a program called poweriso or something similar to that. Mount the cd1 iso file an choose install, whem it asks for the second cd, unmount the first and mount the second and choose continue or wathever it says... then it will ask for the first one again so do the same proceedure with the unmounting and mounting and wait for the setup to finish... then play the game... If you chose compact installation you're gonna need to have cd1 one mounted as you would with a ""real"" drive. Good luck!!"
,Dare-Sama,2007-02-12T15:14Z,"When i run the game, it says that cannot find files, Reinstall or insert CD or something...I have done everything as you sayed...HELP!"

,Jan899,2007-07-28T01:25Z,"Sorry.. stupid question..

Should I ""mount"" the ""cdÂ´s"" and their
files to the same folder?"
,Mcready,2007-07-29T13:42Z,well if u want to. Doesnt matter where u put the .iso files aslong as u know where they are when ur goin to mount them ;)
,Jan899,2007-07-30T00:08Z,"yeah. thanx.. : Solve that already..

But another problems ooccurs.. Mounting went
good, install also fine..

,matt198992,2007-10-13T18:58Z,"works PERFECTLY. as the author said, just use daemon tools (or a similar program) and mount it and install.

during installation when it asks to insert disk 2, just mount disk 2 and hit yes, and do the same to reinsert disk 1. its not that hard guys. if it is, you shoulnt be dealing with torrents. lol. 

anyway, i love this game, its another from a long time ago that up to 50$ new if you want to buy. BS. ty.

10/10"
,Multislaggan,2008-01-27T17:33Z,I just can't find the iso-files to mount with daemon tools damnit! I open the downloaded map and there's nothing! What shold I do? Copy them to new folders or what?
,Multislaggan,2008-01-27T18:06Z,"OK. I installed the game, but the pointer is not to be found! WTF?!"
,micarone,2008-02-21T11:13Z,"Same thing with me too. The game installs just fine and starts up just fine but there's no frikkin' mouse pointer anywhere and cursor keys won't do any good in the action menu.
I've tried to change my desktop bitdepth to 16bits as it recommends - with no effect.
I've tried to run it in Windows 98/Me compatible mode but all what happened was that my whole system jammed.
So WTF is problem and does anyone have a slightest idea how to fix it?
I'd REALLY want to play this game once again, but it seems too damn hopeless... :(("
,rbaleksandar,2008-04-06T11:46Z,"micarone, there is NO CURSOR in this MI. That's just a new gameplay, that's all."
,Xenomorphica,2008-04-06T16:03Z,"Seriously, where is the files that need mounting. I've been through every folder and deamon tools see's nothing that it can mount."
,zeraij,2008-04-12T13:03Z,"what is the iso file in the second folder, cant find anything to mount to continue the instalation. Please can some one tell me"
,woomonkies,2008-07-08T08:03Z,"This works wonderfully!  Just follow these steps to get the game working:

Firstly, you don't need to burn the files to CD's.  Simply download the latest Daemon Tool from here and install it:  

http://www.daemon-tools.cc/dtcc/download.php?mode=ViewCategory&catid=5

Next, right click the Daemon tool and choose Virtual CD ROM then scroll over Device...and then select Mount Image.  This feature emulates the file information as if it were reading a physical CD in your D Drive.   Search for the CD1 file where ever you downloaded that to on your computer and select it...the CD should load for installation.  When the installation prompts for CD2, follow the steps above to mount CD2 and continue installation, again for CD1 when it prompts.  

To play the game, make sure CD1 is mounted and then start your adventure!

At the end of CD1 you'll be prompted for CD2.  I had some trouble trying to exit the game with the alt-tab method, so I downloaded a program called EMI Laucnher that was designed to run a  windowed mode of the game.  Simply use it while CD1 is mounted.  You can find it here:

http://quick.mixnmojo.com/downloads?download=EMILauncher1.5.zip

Once prompted for the CD change, in window mode, mount CD2 and the game should automatically continue.

Note:  Gameplay features do not include a mouse cursor.  Press F1 to see the main menu and ""H"" to see the keyboard shortcuts which include the arrow keys and Page Up and Page Down as main control functions.

Enjoy!!!

,soniasonia21,2008-07-12T05:00Z,"hey Woomonkies guy, you seem to know a lot about computers problems, here's mine: I downloaded and installed Daemon tool as you said to do and also the EMI launcher. I mounted the 2 .iso files when asked during the installation, everything worked great for the installation. but now that I want to play i can't launch the damn game it just crashes to my desktop when i run the game.... !!!! ARGH!
the EMI Launcher doesn't work at all for me: it crashes to the desktop as well as the monkey.exe file either for the windowed or fullscreen mode. I downloaded the last patch for monkey4 and installed it and i mounted the CD 1 before running the game and it still crashes. What do I do wrong? I did everything you said to do. I got Windows 2000 pro.
My video card is a ATi radeon 9800 AGP and directX is installed and Direct3d works fine too.
Can you help me? thank you.

,jack_mehoff,2008-11-10T05:14Z,"1) I downloaded game
2) Unzipped both files
3)Unzipped both files again
4) Opened the ""Monkey"" file to start up the setup
5) It got to about 50%
6)It told me I need to insert CD2 to continue so I go to the second cd file and choose ""autorun"" and it does absolutely nothing

I was curious because everybody says ""mount the isos"" I know how to mount stuff, it's just there's absolutely no Iso's.  None show up when I filter for them.

I tried to mount the ""monkey"" and ""autorun"" files but to no affect. Can someone please tell me?

,xheffalump,2008-12-15T17:20Z,"Installed game and played up until the end of CD1 with no problems, and then kABoOm! - every time I go to mount CD2 the whole game just crashes and dies on its arse.

At first I was using Ctrl-Alt-Delete to bring up the task manager and return to desktop (because for some weird reason, EFMI won't let me use the Alt-Tab function) so that I could mount the second CD. After that I tried woomonkies suggestion - EMI Launcher.

Ran the game in a windowed version and tried mounting CD2 again and it still crashed. I'm sad :'(

Any other suggestions guys? Like I said, CD1 ran like a dream and I had no problems at all up until Guybrush and his crew decided to sail to this new feckin' island!"

,liberate98,2009-07-13T20:28Z,"I was able to mount both files with daemon tools, and it installed fine for me.

If you're having in-game problems due to the separate CDs, then I advise getting a no-cd crack from gamecopyworld.com"
,im2cool4uroflolz,2009-07-15T15:35Z,";-;

So I get the torrent downloaded, move everything DISC1- related to the DISC1 folder and same for DISC2, mount Disc 1...

It comes up with the autorun. Not the install, the autorun. None of the options work (though I can click on them)"
,soulfried,2009-09-17T08:23Z,"used a program called magic disk and this torret works great. Just mount disc one from a known location, start install, when it asks for disc 2, unmount disc 1, mount 2 and press continue, then do the same when it asks for 1 again. Think of the mounting process as putting a disc in the drive and unmounting like taking it out and the steps are actually very simple."
,Laith_88,2009-11-15T13:45Z,"Thank you very much. It worked perfectly in Vista. It's easy to install too, just mount 1 then 2 when prompted and then 1 again in the end and voila you now have the fourth installment of the best game series ever."
,YarzRevenge,2010-01-24T04:07Z,"Install works like a charm using Power ISO and Magic ISO. For those having problems try a different program to mount the ISO. Now I just need a noCD patch so I won't have to mount CD1 every time :)

,energico,2010-03-27T16:56Z,"guys, it's so simple. here's what i did:


-> mount CD1 ISO
-> begin installation
-> at 50% installation, unmount CD1 ISO and mount CD2 ISO
-> continue installation
-> at end of installation, unmount CD2 ISO and mount CD1 ISO"
,Cgoff87,2010-03-31T09:44Z,"Congratulations Guys!!!

Your now amongst the 25,000,000 people who already know how to do this!!

lo jk

And also remember some files could be diffrent than iso.

 e.g. Bin, Vcd, uif

I recommend that anyone use Daemon tools lite, as it has extensive mounting abilities.

Alcohol 120%  is also good when it comes to turning anything into cds. With it you can also burn Playstation 2 games on dvd and in NTFS format and use them like a real game cd.

,atma_gyan,2011-03-07T23:25Z,Does anyone else have an issue with dialogue controls? The game went fine until the first scene where Guybrush had to talk to somebody (at the mansion). The answers can be highlighted but the enter key doesn't work nor does any other key; I have tried all of them. I even tried changing the controls but the new key doesn't work either. Not to mention that once the dialogue options are showing I can't escape them in order to try doing something else like walking elsewhere.
,atma_gyan,2011-04-01T17:01Z,"I got the above fixed somehow but now it keeps crashing and rebooting my computer. It got worse after I got arrested, same as JennL."
,BOLTpra,2011-04-11T09:27Z,"ya.. i installed it and am running the disk 2

extract the 2 zip files given in torrent. you'll get two iso files. mount them with software like daemon tools, power iso,etc(googlethem and you'll get them - instructions too) mount first disk, install, mount second when asked for it. when running game mount the first image file.

when i reached jambalaya(whatever) island, it asked for cd2. if i quit i couldnt return to that moment. task manager, cursor and alt-tab dont work, i cudnt find any saved games on net for after the cd2 asker(except in french!). luckily, woomonkies commented(and gave link) to an emi launcher. it works and no virus shit. use it to run the game in windowed mode, n mount second disk

xp professional, 1gb ram, 128 mb standard intel chipset video card"
,breezr,2011-10-12T05:29Z,"OK READ CAREFULLY

i recently fell victum to the saame problem the group that couldnt get the iso to load...i tryed everything. then i tryed this.. FOLLOW these steps exactly

1.DELETE YOUR UNPACKED FOLDERS OF ESCAPE FROM MONKEY ISLAND

2.GO TO YOUR ORIGINAL DOWNLOAD FOLDER OF ESCAPE FROM MONKEY ISLAND

3.DOUBLE CLICK THAT AND DOUBLE CLICK YOUR ESCAPE FROM MONKEY ISLAND DISK 1 FOLDER

4 DRAG THE ONE FILE (USUALLY AN ICON OF A GOLDEN DISC) INTO A FOLDER OF YOUR CHOICE

5.REPEAT THE SAME STEP FOR DISK 2!  

IMPORTANT:DO NOT EXTRACT THE DISK ITSELF AS YOU NEED THE ISO FILE IN TACT.

6.DOWNLOAD A MOUNTER OF YOUR CHOICE(I USED POWER ISO) 

7.LOAD UP  :MY COMPUTER:

8.RIGHT CLICK THE VIRTUAL DRIVE YOUR MOUNTER HAS CREATED IN YOUR MY COMPUTER FOLDER

9.CLICK MOUNT IMAGE

10.NAVIGATE IT TO THE FOLDER YOU SAVED YOUR ISO FILES TO(GOLDEN DISCS) AND DOUBLE CLICK DISK ONE

INSTALL THE GAME AND WHEN ASKED TO INSERT DISK 2 REPEAT STEP 8 TO 10 BUT INSTEAD OF CLICKING DISK ONE CLICK,DISK 2.
FINISH THE INSTALATION AND REMOUNT DISK ONE USING STEP 8 TO 10 AGAIN

THATS It....   sorry for using so much detail but there is alot of ppl out there that dont understand image mounting... i think this explains it all
"
,bruh16,2011-11-16T17:12Z,"Well, it took me about a weak to download this file and unhappily it doesn't work the normal way it should. I thought it was just simple as burning the ISO files, but it seems people are using mounting programs. I've already tried Daemon, PowerIso, Power Magic, but they don't work. What will I do? Ti think find another torrent, that's it."
