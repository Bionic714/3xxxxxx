,manicmailman,2007-02-08T13:01Z,THANKS for the seed! I don't know why it took me until now to search for this great show. Right from the first episeode I knew it was too cool a show to last very long.
,Liddan,2007-04-16T02:31Z,"I beg of you, please reseed this, I have been looking for this serie for years."
,tracker2208,2007-04-17T08:00Z,"I know how you feel Liddan.  I've been searching about once or twice a year for this show for the past 4 or 5 years.  I just found this a couple days ago.  I'm 70% done with the first three episodes completed.  I normally don't make it a point to seed torrents I download, but when I'm done I'm going to seed the crap out of this.  There were a couple of seeders that disappeared today. "
,nonimus,2008-08-14T22:41Z,I've completed this after downloading for days and days and I'll seed for as long as possible. I expect you all to do the same.
,buttonsmum,2008-12-26T01:40Z,thanks  your a star..
,Zzznorch,2009-07-09T23:33Z,The DVD's are available from http://www.dvdavenue.tv/movies/drama/vengeance_unlimited.html but unfortunately there is no DVDrip available here yet.  This quality of the video's in this torrent is okay but there are few glitches and ghosts which are to be expected from an over-the-air analog broadcast.  Too bad the ripper did not have cable ;-)
,gold167,2010-03-14T02:16Z,This was a great show when it was on TV - Channel 4
