,KutmasteR,2006-09-12T08:48Z,What kind of files are these?
,stele007,2006-09-12T20:50Z,Ogg Vorbis.  Winamp can handle them.
,gaelenmag,2006-09-13T04:28Z,It would be nice if you posted it in normal MP3. Most people don't use Winamp or have access to a free OGG converter (I couldn't find one for download).
,MrThePlague,2006-09-13T05:46Z,"So out of 619 downloads, 2 don't know what an ogg is or how to handle it? That's not enough impetus for me to change my ripping format to .mp3, sorry. And everyone has access to a free ogg converter, because it's a fucking open source codec."
,nerhal,2006-09-19T08:29Z,mp3 at constant bitrate at 320 kb per sec is perfect format to send over the internet. and is a hella more convinient. so yeah winamp what??
,MrThePlague,2006-09-21T01:06Z,Less than .001% of people who downloaded this torrent seem to disagree with you. Fuck off.
,nerhal,2006-09-29T10:35Z,hey you fuck off fagot!
,MrThePlague,2006-10-02T01:19Z,Die in a house fire? Don't download the torrent if you're too stupid to get your computer to read the ogg file.
,DanceToTheStars,2006-11-15T11:16Z,Just use google to find a way to convert the files...
,VEpP,2008-05-02T05:29Z,"SERIOUSLY
FOOBAR2000 FOR THE FUCKING WIN.

it plays everything with no lag. srsly. i used winamp, then i found this. it doesnt look shiny, but seriously, how many of you leave your winamp/wmp open just to look at it?
