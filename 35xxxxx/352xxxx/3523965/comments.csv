,CharlesDarwin,2006-10-01T00:44Z,"lol I think I'm doing something wrong here...

It installs just fine from the ISO after mounting it into daemon tools, BUT I can't seem to backup this download to disc...

I unrar'd, then I took the contents of the ISO file and moved it all to a folder, from there I'm able to install just fine. When I try to burn the contents of the folder to disc it doesn't work. I get EXTREMELY slow read times and the setup doesn't even run.

So to all who's reading this:

IF YOU WANT TO BURN THIS DO DISC, JUST BURN ALL THE RAR FILES AND UNRAR IT WHENEVER YOU INSTALL ON A DIFFERENT COMPUTER. 

At least this is how I THINK its done... I dunno, I gotta redownload now and see cuz I deleted all the files once I burned the disc ("
,Blackwing Dragon,2006-10-01T01:18Z,"You do NOT have to do the whole "" burn "" shit. I'm sick of people saying you do when you DO NOT.
It makes things easier for storing, but then again, if you beat it, will you even play it sometime later?
Christ.

Anyway, I tried unraring it and near the end, it said there was a CRC error. Effectively, the ISO didn't come out at all. Hence, this torrent is f*cked."

,CharlesDarwin,2006-10-02T22:23Z,"Blackwing Dragon, your the biggest fucking moron I've ever seen on the internet. Seriously. You should feel proud that out there, there is a guy who thinks your the stupidest fucking moron he has ever seen in his life.

First of all: Don't tell people not to burn it. I'm not downloading a 4GB game so that I can leave it sitting on my HDD taking up space. You fucking idiotic moron. 

Second: The reason it didn't extract for you is because your computer is a dumb peice of shit and the download YOU got probably got corrupt either by not closing your torrent client propperly or just interupting the download way to many times.

Seriously mother fucker, its a free game, don't bitch, and don't call people idiots when clearly your the biggest fucking idiot here."

,Dossla,2008-12-30T19:26Z,"How to install??
PLZ Tell me!!"
,Irishramb,2009-01-29T02:49Z,"This game is fantastic. I have it at my other house and it is a resource whore on your PC, very demanding game, but it's awesome.

I'll start the download as soon as I'm done DL'ing Rome Total War, and I promise to seed them both =)"
,Irishramb,2009-01-29T21:55Z,"Confirming successful installation. This is how I did it:

Navigate to where you downloaded the torrent. Select the first .rar file and unpack it into the same folder where everything is. Mount the .iso that you just unpacked (I used Daemon Tools). When it prompts you select View All Files. Navigate down to Setup. NOT AcroSetup, this is something different. When it asks for the CD Key use the one posted on the bottom of page six, it works fine.

After that you're all set =)
I promise to seed for a while :=)"
,goofisteve,2009-02-21T05:26Z,"It worked Just Fine!
Just follow Irishramb's directions and you'll be set to go!

P.s. 177 comments and only 6 seeders? 
Seed, don't be a jerk!"
