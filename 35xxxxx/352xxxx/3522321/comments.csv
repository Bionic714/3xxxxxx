Do u have Utopia as well ? the one thats been put on pb by someone else is of awfull quality , so i would gladly redownload if the original would be better !!!"
,Clansman-uk,2006-09-13T18:51Z,"Whats wrong with micvel's Utopia DVD????

Before complaining consider this, the film was low budget & was made over 50 years ago. 

Things do deteriate with age, just like the brain."
,thatsmine,2006-09-14T07:10Z,"read my last words !
""if the original would be better ""
i beleave utopia was the very last movie they made ? so then i would expsect that one to be of better quality as it is less old ...
it made me think it was a converted avi / mpeg file into dvd.
If not , then okay ..."
,flash_214,2006-09-15T17:39Z,"I recorded Utopia from TCM awhile ago and the video quality was actually worse than the one uploaded here.

I don't think you will find a better quality Utopia."
