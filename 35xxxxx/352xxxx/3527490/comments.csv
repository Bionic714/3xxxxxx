,vinylking,2006-09-27T15:41Z,Many thanx. TW is great and so is FLAC. I wish more people would upload music in FLAC.
,ethanoic,2006-10-26T07:40Z,"Yes vinylking - flac is great. But I often have to recode to mp3 depending on where I want to listen to it. Same if I give a copy to someone else.

I wish more players would play flac!"

Hope it's something with my audio player or something."
