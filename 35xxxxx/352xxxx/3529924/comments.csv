,scudruck,2006-10-16T20:57Z,"This saved as a folder, unlike heroes episode 2&3 that are avi files and work greeat. The only video file i can play is a one minute sample vid. Other then that there is a rar file and and sfv, anhd a bunch of numbered R files (ex: R00,R01-R23) none of which will play. There is also an MSinfodocument but when i click it it says ""cannot recognize this NFO file. it might be corrupted or an unrecognized version"". Im am not sure what to do and am new to torrent. can somebody please help me? my email is iamacn@hotmail.com

Thanks"
,The Teacher,2006-10-18T14:05Z,"You need a little program named WinRar to extract the files... then you get a .avi-file! 

MSInfo documents can be opened with Notepad."
,-pete-,2006-10-19T12:59Z,"Why do you guys insist on putting these in numbered rar files? I can't see much difference in size or anything, its just another thing for me to extract?

Not bitching just wondering :)

Thanks for the file anyway, keep up the good fight :)"
,crackhammer,2006-10-24T01:38Z,Good job!!!! Thanks for uploading!
,xenoxs,2006-10-25T22:33Z,"Thnaks for this great upload. Just one suggestion.
Why don't you guys compress these files using Xvid, the file sizes will then be half of the actual size and faster to download."

,hank0940,2006-11-25T12:20Z,"Hej, kan någon vänlig själ förklara hur det är? S01E00 är det pilotavsnittet? Eller är episoderna s01E01 och S01E02 piloten uppdelad på två? Jag läste att piloten blivit nedklippt till en episode, och blev lite förvirrad...

Jag antar att man ska se E00 först och sedan E01, E02 osv?

Tackar på förhand."

,LunarKaos,2009-06-01T22:00Z,"for those of u who r complaining that even though this says its HD, the file size states the obvious. if u search ur channel listings, theres something called HDTV channels. this is recorded from 1 of those channels, and then cropped and uploaded. the blurred box is the channels logo, i wouldnt want that on any vid i upload, and im pretty sure no1 else would.

and thanx for the u/p ares."
