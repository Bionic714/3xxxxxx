,thiagopanda,2008-09-20T07:14Z,is this the original from 1920 or the remake from 2005 ?
,harigata,2008-10-21T02:26Z,Man the subs are in SPANISH!
,harigata,2008-10-21T02:39Z,"Forgive my discontentedness,
but are the fucked-up English texts part of the original issue?"
,harigata,2008-10-21T03:22Z,"I'm not sure yet, but it seems the ""fucked-up"" English texts are part of a German restoration of the movie. I was expecting the old square-styled text cards I've been used to in silent movies, hence my mistake. Apologies....

And thanks a lot for the upload!"
,Coobanos,2008-11-30T23:40Z,"fuck the subs, fuck the dubbing, this is an silent movie you american idiots, i've already download the movie and some dude explaines every scene, wft is wrong with you junkfood lovers?"
,scoobydoo2u2,2008-12-16T05:00Z,Many thanks for the upload. Excellent quality. This is the 1996 restoration. Very clean sharp print. The intertitles are in English but made to look like the German originals. There are 2 selectable audio tracks. Track 1 is the standard music track. Track 2 has the DVD commentary by film historian Mike Budd. Choose the correct audio track if you are watching for the 1st time. The Portuguese subtitles are optional and can be turned off. Great work. Well done.

Greetings."
