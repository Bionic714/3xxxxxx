,protocogni,2006-09-10T00:28Z,"Typical, no other way to download the latest securom bypass but here.

I think the other ""Sword of the Stars"" seeders should have made better research before wasting peoples time with giving us half the deal.
Without securom bypass, people can forget running this game, and you are the only one offering the bypass at all, applications included.
So screw the other seeders for wasting our time.

All credit to you geckoone, for giving us the complete, and not half the package.

Too many lousy seeders out there."

3. in the CureROM language i lefted English Internal default and i created a new CureROM profile selecting swordofthestars.exe in the install dir.
   Aplication arguments i lefted empty coz i dont know what to put there.
   Aditional options i lefted UNCHEKED
   In the Black-list i SELECTED CureROM anti-Blacklist measures

,crissxcross,2007-09-11T09:50Z,seed pls :)
,Goodsword,2008-08-08T19:49Z,"When I ran the CureRom setup, I received a trojan virus warning.  I don't think you have to worry about it if you don't run this part of the torrent.  Find it somewhere else, maybe?"
,dangleskin,2011-06-05T22:37Z,I really want to play that game but there is a virus in it :(
