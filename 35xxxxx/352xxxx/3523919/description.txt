Kel'Thuzad the Final Boss In Naxxramus, the hardest and possibly last Wow 40 Man instance. This movie is the entire kill with a few parts cut out, to at least leave a little to the imagination.

The Movie is shot from a DPS warrior POV. ( Nazghul ).

Song credits are in the movie at the end - so please don't ask about them.
