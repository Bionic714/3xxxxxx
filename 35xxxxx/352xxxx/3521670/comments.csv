,amber82,2006-09-11T05:38Z,really it has only 192kbps
,tzongue,2007-04-18T11:28Z,"Probably not even 192, if it's true that this was only released on cassette.  But thanks for the upload!  I look forward to comparing it with my ""168"" copy.  There are rumored to be 2 versions of the compilation."
,tzongue,2007-06-30T14:27Z,"kudos on sharing this lovely album, but FYI: this got out only as a cassette bootleg.  a 320 recording is therefore a transcode."
,tzongue,2007-06-30T14:27Z,"LOL, didn't even realize i'd commented here before. i feel douchely"
,mrbitbot,2008-01-01T01:13Z,Thank you! I've been looking for the 12 track version of this!
