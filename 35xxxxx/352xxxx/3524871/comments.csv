,JubbHubb,2006-12-16T23:57Z,plz seed
,shiverix,2007-01-01T23:20Z,Can someone please seed for just a little bit? It's stuck at 92.5% and if someone could seed me to 100% I'd be happy to take over seeding.
,atreju1978,2007-01-07T17:31Z,"I'm stuck at 94.5% now. So if anybody decided to re-seed, it seems it wasn't enough."
,tadaoando,2007-01-21T12:23Z,"Thank you so much to the uploader, I haven't been able to find this game in any stores in my area.

But would somebody out there PLEASE SEED?
I'm stuck at 88%, 95% and 97% for the 3 DVDS!
Thank you! "
,atreju1978,2007-01-22T11:44Z,"Okay - so this is what I did. I downloaded a DVD9 version from another torrent site - it didn't work. So I got the original game from ebay - and that didn't work with swap magic either.  I'm going to get a chip for my machine now, but I fear that's no use either. (swap magic said the original game was ""not a valid ps2 disc). Only this version works for me, so please please please seed!"
,tadaoando,2007-01-25T06:48Z,"Attention: 
Don't bother with this torrent, it is dead. Nobody has the last 5%."
,atreju1978,2007-01-27T00:25Z,"Actually, I have some good news. After I bought the game, I have now done the same as the original uploader and split the original game into three discs. The files match the filesize of these ones. But how do I upload them as part of this torrent?"
