,spiralgirl,2006-12-11T06:43Z,I have the same problem where it says a problem was detected with your application.  Please reinstall the software.  Does this even work.  Twice I opened the zip file and got the same message.
,mac_davis,2007-01-16T06:50Z,"Hard to believe this is 65 megabytes ;)

Don't even try downloading stuff like this, the package should be gigabytes, even compressed."
,powerscape,2007-02-25T03:29Z,"I downloaded this fucking torrent file triple times in Mac Os 10.4.7. But when I start to open Dreamweaver 8 application, I got an error message that ""A problem was detected with your application. Please reinstall this software to correct the problem"". Also, I tried every solution like using Appzapper for deleting Dreamweaver MX 7.0 in my entire system. Finally, I understood that this is a missing torrent file. Never waste your time for downloading this torrent file."
,kimberntson,2007-06-03T21:48Z,"HI there,
most probably this version is an PowerPC-version only. I hade the same message on a downloaded torrent. It did not run on my INtel MacBook, but runs flawlessly on my PPC Mini."
