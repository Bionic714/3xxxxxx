,holymoo,2007-01-18T22:00Z,"I don't know if it's just me, but should there be 2 .img files in this torrent?"
,roghaj,2007-01-20T01:04Z,"I guess this is dead.  I checked peers and all were topped out at 99.8.  If that was the problem 3 months ago, I doubt it will get any better.  "

,blemishednicely,2007-12-04T05:40Z,"So (even though it looks like it's been 86'd), can I play this on my PC, or is it ONLY for burning an ""unofficial"" disc for an XBOX 360? New to this shit & don't want to waste my time DL'ing primo games I can't even use---have awesome laptop/no XBOX....still in it or fucked solid? R.S.V.P."
,Dani25,2008-11-02T00:25Z,"can somebody seed it...i just got a modded 360 and i really wanna play this game lol
i can only find the pal version wich is not good for me"

,Padraic_Seebrr,2009-08-01T06:21Z,"Hey thanks for torrent, I know this sounds stupid, but will this work on a normal XBOX360 or do I have to buy a special one? What I mean is what is ""modded""?"
,Cavecock,2009-10-15T08:33Z,"@padraic - a ""modded"" 360 means the dvd drive has been flashed with new firmware, i recommend having a friend or ""service"" provider do this if you are not a knowledgeable tech person, after that you must use abgx and imgburn to make this a useable game, the burning is fairly simple its flashing the 360 that is the tricky part  "
,davired,2010-06-15T16:48Z,"Someone can seed, please? I see only people with 99,8% on the peers menu, none have the full game... I would be very appreciated."
