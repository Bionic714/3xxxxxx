WASTELAND, Issue #1: \"Some Kind Of Stranger\"

One hundred years after the Big Wet, Earth has been left a broken, infertile world of rock and sand. The town of Providence is like many others on the post-Big Wet planet - small, mostly illiterate, and struggling for survival. When the town welcomes a stranger named Michael into its midst, will the quiet man lead them to a brave new world or shatter what little order still exists?
