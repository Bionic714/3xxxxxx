I can understand why this says ""The Original"" on it.  This is the original 2 live crew with all the original members before luke came along.  I'll tell you why.  

1) These are songs that were made when they was in calironia before luke signed them to Skyywalker Records (later to be renamed Luke Records).  The 2 live crew was originally from california.  Luke brought them back to miami.

2) Shortly after 2 live crew won thier case against broward county for trying to ban their music.  the 2 live crew broke up.  brother marquies left and started a group with dj toop call 2 nasty.  fresh kid ice did a solo album and luke released a few solo albums.  Then luke brought in verb to replace brother marquis luke labeled it The New 2 LIve Crew.  

So there is nothing fake about this torrent.  This is the ""Original 2 Live Crew"""
