Ron Paul is a Republican member of the United States House of Representatives. In this speech before the US House of Representatives Ron Paul goes through the real reasons for USA?s warmongering policy. He points out that Saddam Hussein had switched to Euro instead of Dollar, threatening the Petrodollar and the Dollars role as the world currency. Iran use Euro when they sell oil to Europe and Asia - but most importantly they are about to open an oil bourse selling oil for euro instead of dollar. This is probably the real reason for the upcoming war against Iran - Iran is threatening the Dollar Hegemony.  

It's a very educational speech.
