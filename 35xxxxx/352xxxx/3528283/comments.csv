,Weymaster,2006-09-23T20:49Z,"Is kind of stupid, his torrent contains another torrent... Maybe a virus or something? I'd keep away from it in any case."
,mrdunworthy,2006-09-23T20:52Z,"It seems that this torrent contains yet another torrent: ""Dragonball Z All Episodes [ENG].torrent""."
,defeatedking,2006-09-26T20:38Z,"this is only episodes 1-276,  277-291 are missing. But the video files are great! thank you!

anybody got 277-291?"
,crackmann,2006-09-30T14:46Z,It's not a virus =)
,tommyboy123x,2006-10-02T03:25Z,This is NOT a virus... good shit is what it is
,ramonator,2006-10-08T03:03Z,where do i get the software to play toorents?
,tommyboy123x,2006-10-08T04:58Z,"http://torrentbox.com/torrent_details?id=27494 is the info about the torrent you will download from here

if you dont understand torrents, don't even bother leeching off us....  but i'll give you a hint, well first of all google, second of all, you don't ""play"" a torrent, and thirdly, http://azureus.sourceforge.net/

if you suck so much at life that you can't figure out how to open up your ports if your behind a hub and stuff, again you shouldn't be downloading it cause i know your not going to seed, but if you are, check out bit comet... it's n00b-friendly"
,tommyboy123x,2006-10-08T05:02Z,"thanks to all the seeders, so far i have a ratio of 2, but in about 2 day's i'll have the whole thing and seed for a good week or two.  Im gonna try to get my ratio up to 3.000 or higher

lol, i already have a share ratio of like 17 for this torrent that your all downloading... that was some hard work giving up all the bandwidth"
,ramonator,2006-10-08T17:49Z,"if u dont play it,den wat u do wit it"
,tommyboy123x,2006-10-08T23:12Z,"a torrent has all the information you need to download the files.  what the torrent downloads is about 30GiB

so the torrent reports to the tracker, in this case torrentbox.com, and torrentbox keeps an eye on evyerone downloading and uploading the files.  Try to keep a download:upload ratio of 1 or more, that means you download just as much as you uploaded.  If you download more than you upload, that is known as leeching... some links to consider
