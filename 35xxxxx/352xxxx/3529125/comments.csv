,wolfie22,2008-03-10T23:35Z,"DON""T BOTHER DOWNLOADING!! These are extremely low res, poor quality .avi's.  I can't see how any of you like these downloads."
,Ohmstar,2008-04-03T05:31Z,"This torrent is better than nothing, but I would rather some high quality versions. Even rips of the Italian DVDs would be awesome, since those are the highest quality DVDs of the show that exist."
,ramajuko,2008-04-28T06:54Z,"@wolfie22

What the hell do you expect from VHS rips? It even says in the description that the resolution is low, learn to read."

,ThePoliticsOfStarving,2009-01-21T15:11Z,"It's amazing how many people will download this and admit to enjoying it, and we're probably all in our 20's too.

Is it just because it reminds us of our childhood, or because we actually like cheesy 1990's kids shows?"

,Damascus25,2010-01-03T22:27Z,"Thanks for the UL, but all should know that some of the titles are in the wrong order.  I recommend checking the series Episode list on IMDB for the correct order.  In season One episodes 41-55 are jumbled.  Just a word of warning so you don't watch it out of order."
,primalclaws1974,2010-01-19T21:56Z,"Downloaded during the night, and was done this morning. I wanted to save some space, downloaded this torrent opposed to another one that was 2 gigs bigger. I should have went with the other. The video is a 4 at best! Looks like VHS copies. Will prob burn one dvd worth and never use this again. Sorry to sound harsh, as this uploader is trying to help people, but it's just not very good!"
