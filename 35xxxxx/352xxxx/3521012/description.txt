The SimFlyer┬« GMXv1 package includes the PMA8000, MX20, GNS480, and SL40 gauges. All have been developed in XML format and designed to extract the information needed to function directly from your Microsoft┬« Flight Simulator 2004┬« GPS data files, and  because they feature their exclusive FRF┬⌐ technology these gauges are very framerate friendly.
      no pass needed
