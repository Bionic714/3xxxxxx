In Open Season, youll team up with a cast of crazy critters for a riotous
romp in the great outdoors. When a grizzly named Boog gets lured into
leaving home by a fast-talking mule deer named Elliot, he finds himself lost
in the woods -- just three days before hunting season. Forced to rough it,
Boog goes native, rallying all the forest animals to take back their home
and send the hunters packing. The rowdy brood of forest animals turns the
tables on a bunch of unsuspecting hunters.
