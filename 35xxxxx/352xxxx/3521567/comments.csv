I urge everybody to try this game and play it for a few days (it needs some getting used to)

If you like it then go buy it and we can play together on multiplayer ..where the real fun begins! :D "

,6FtUndr001,2007-07-14T18:45Z,"DON'T Download!! This doesn't even have all the files! I would say 3/4s of the game files needed to play the game are not present with this download! The entire DATA folder is missing! You get the movies folder and 1 of 2 .gob files, which are needed to play. And the NOCD crack is also missing! So I say again, DON'T DOWNLOAD!"
