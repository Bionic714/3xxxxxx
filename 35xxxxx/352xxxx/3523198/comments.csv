,Siovhan,2006-09-28T22:22Z,is this directors cut or US version?
,Siovhan,2006-09-30T21:59Z,"ok i downloaded it, its the cheesy shitty directors cut version, the USA version with the tangerine dream score is much better"
,IchBin,2007-09-20T23:55Z,"Well after downloading this version I have no sound on file VTS_01_1.VOB. Sound is OK for all other files. Could anyone confirm that this file is damaged and has no sound. Hopefully the initial poster can resolve. 

Back in the late 80's I bought this movie in VHS format.  The music is not the Eng version. The rock Group ""Yes"" had a few sound tracks recorded for this move which this one does not have. And as also mentioned also the group ""Tangerine Dream"". Real disappointed because the video quality is great."
