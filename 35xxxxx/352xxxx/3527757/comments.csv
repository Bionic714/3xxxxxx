,markerb,2008-02-04T11:06Z,"Thank you new seeder...  Some of us our still here, getting teeny download rates of our few last packets."
,markerb,2008-02-05T16:22Z,"Oh, pooh!  ""New seeder"" left, and I was probably the only one who didn't get the last few chunks.

Beware, newcomers.  The Pirate Bay has been listing a seeder that doesn't exist."
,markerb,2008-02-06T13:51Z,"Okay...  I finally got the whole thing.  Thanks!

Now I'm the only one seeding this, with nobody downloading.  I'll wait for a bit, and then give up.  At that point, this torrent will be dead."
