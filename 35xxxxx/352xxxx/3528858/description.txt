This is the very hard-to-find major label debut of Swans' "The Burning World".  It was an experiment in more subdued instrumentation and acoustic songwriting than  were found on previous Swans albums.  M. Gira seems to have been disappointed with the album and it has gone out of print.  I am only making this available because it is virtually impossible to find (unless you want to shell out $60.00).  Gira did re-release this album briefly in 2003 as "Forever Burned", an online only autographed CD-R, but it is now unavailable. 

Contained herein are the usual dark, depressing Swans dirges but performed in a less abrasive manner than earlier albums.  Strangely, a haunting version of Traffic's "Can't Find My Way Home" was included.   Also appearing is the Swans classic "God Damn the Sun".  The more melodic yet still heavy music here seems to document the beginnings of Gira's forays into what would later become The Angels of Light.

Enjoy the music,
Love, Chronophobe.
