nfo:
=========
PROPER REASON: lame group did other release with DSR source and try to pass it off
as PDTV.
look at xor.frame.23626: there are no popups in digital source. If it is
an affil miracle, the popup should be cut off
because its fs with black bars.
but you really need to just watch it to see its a crappy DSR.
We included a sample pic comparing theirs and ours.
Color bleeds and artifacts in their rls (this is everywhere
in their release). Ours does not.
So Lesson of the day, SD DSR, not PDTV :-P
