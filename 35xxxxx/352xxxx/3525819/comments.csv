,poKonom,2006-09-20T02:44Z,Hey yiuloan...i keep gettin stuck on downloads...how can I tell which ones to download?   Some have scene names.  whats the deal??
,wanderingeyes,2008-01-29T18:51Z,"Can I make a suggestion to torrenters in general? Can whoever posted it include the TITLE of the episode is in the NFO? Or whoever's downloaded it mention it? That'd stop all this confusion and moaning about 'seasons'.

Anyway; this one is 'Mother Tucker'.
Case in point... I didn't want to d/l this one!"
