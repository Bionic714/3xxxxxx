Thor: Son of Asgard  (2004-2005)

Issues  #01  -  #12


Before he claimed the throne, before he battled 
the dragon Fafnir, before he became worthy of 
mighty Mjolnir, he was simply Thor, one of many 
young sons of Asgard. In a saga of courage, 
adversity, revenge and brotherhood, Thor faces 
perils that will challenge his mettle as a young 
warrior, and trials that will test and temper 
his immortal spirit. Sent on a Great Quest by 
All-Father Odin, Thor and a fellowship of other 
young godlings Balder, Sif and Loki face their coming 
of age in this epic story written by celebrated manga 
writer Akira Yoshida and beautifully illustrated by 
Greg Tocchini.
