
DOCUMENTARY: Chile: The Other 9/11 
On: BBC 4 

On the morning of Tuesday, September 11th 1973, two jets launched a 
deadly attack on the Presidential Palace of la Moneda in the heart of 
Santiago, Chile. The result was fire, the suicide of President 
Salvador Allende and ultimately the death or disappearance of over 
three thousand people. 

This documentary pieces together the dramatic hour-by-hour events of 
the military coup that brought to power General Augusto Pinochet and 
changed the course of the Cold War.
