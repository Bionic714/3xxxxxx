The Meiks brothers, twelve-year-old Fenton and nine-year-old Adam, enjoy an idyllic relationship with their father, a kind and sensitive man still recovering from the death of his beloved wife. When their father suddenly announces that he has been visited by an angel who has entrusted him with the holy mission of destroying "demons" who pose as ordinary men and women, the boy┬┤s faith in their father is tested. With an axe and a list of names believed to be from God, Fenton and Adam are forced to help their father rid the world of "evil".
