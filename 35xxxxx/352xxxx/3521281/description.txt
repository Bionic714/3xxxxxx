Subtitled: British Sixties Acid Obscurities (Various Artists 1966-1968)
No real apparent publisher, but the case is marked "Para CD 002"
Encoded 320 kbps CBR LAME MP3 for no good reason, since most of the 
songs sound like they're from the mid-60s. But worth a listen for 
historical purposes and possibly of value to the collector.
