,webrosc,2006-09-23T23:43Z,"whats the point in sharing this? you need a mod chip or swap magic to use it, and if you have those you don't need hd advance.

But saying that hd advance is excellent, i use it myself :)"

..So how do you propose to install games on a PS2 hard disk without HD Advance?   Burn a CD/DVD every time you want to test a new game?"
,rreedd321,2006-10-01T21:58Z,does anyone know how to get this to work? that would be cool if you could let me know
,vali31,2007-07-25T03:00Z,Jennysalala.........HOW CAN I compress a file like you did.  I have a DVD .iso that I would like to compress like you  did.  Can you please let me know how you do it?
,hangon,2007-09-26T17:10Z,"Hi jennysalala , I'm also interested on how you compressed 6GB to a 4MB... please let us know...thx."
,mrspock09,2007-11-02T02:10Z,yea could you let us know how to compress 6 gig to 4 mb?? that would be very helpful
,freakshow17,2008-01-04T23:35Z,"Hey Jennysalala - Thanks so much for this torrent.  but how do I mount it so that my PS2 will recognize it?  I downloaded it, unzipped it, and found 2 folders - CD and DVD. I mounted the DVD ISO with POWER ISO but the PS2 didn't recognize the disc. Then I tried by burning the MDS file. still the PS2 doesn't recognize the disc to load HD Advance.  Any ideas?"
,diddy4444,2008-05-29T05:27Z,how do i sucsessfully burn these files back on to disc i tried it with img burn and my ps3 wont rekignise it
,y0ul053,2008-11-20T03:24Z,"it's not for PS3, DURRR.

Anyways... so many idiots out there so let it be clear.  You actually need to buy Swap Magic to be able to burn and read games.  HDAdvance and HD Loader let you use a HD with a PS2 (and I believe read burnt discs) but the point being that you MUST buy one to make any burnt disc work with your PS2."
,fpcguy,2010-02-25T16:50Z,"Someone who has a mod chip would want this.  Especially if it can't support ToxicOS.  Someone like me has swap magic, but I get tired of the load times and disc read errors, so it's better to have games on the hard drive instead.  

It was shrunk to 4 MB because the original disc contained dead bytes to make it the size of a PS game. Tricking the PS2 to allocated enough memory to load a full game. (Usually is the reason for doing this)  Basically it's smaller to write 50(0) instead of 00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 for those who don't understand compression.

Now the PROBLEM.
This is PAL not NTSC."
,Foozlesnorf,2011-02-24T07:40Z,"As fpcguy said... ""Someone who has a mod chip would want this""

& when you have a handy dandy modchip.... PAL/NTSC doesn't matter since it will then read both, woot ;)"
,xXBLACKXx,2011-08-29T20:25Z,"to get HD advanced 2.0 to work u need 2 esr patch it first. google esr patch download it run it as admin. and patch the HD advanced iso. after that u either need a mod chip or mcboot, if u have mcboot the esr loader will come up automaticaly. make sure u have ur disc drive opening tool ready. ur gonna need 2 take off the face plate u can check youtube on how 2 swap discs in ur ps2. once u get HD advanced running use ur drive tool 2 get ur drive tray open do not push eject. place ur burned disc in2 the tray or back up close the tray quick enough (dont break it) so that it goes in2 place. next click convert cuz it is the PAL version then ur game should install. thank u"
