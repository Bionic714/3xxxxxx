,Yobo1987,2006-09-19T07:50Z,"For you that have the disk space problem, try to copy all the files from your cd to a folder in the desktop. Then try from that folder to install. Worked for me."

,Spyder69,2006-09-19T19:38Z,"Yobo1987, worked for me too. Thanks.
I also changed the environment area for TMP and TEMP values to another disc because I didn't have 5 GB on my C disc + restart.

Not to mentioned single player campain seems to be something wrong with too after u get out in the game, thinking there are some realy annoing bugs in this game. Any1 else experience this too eh. btw besides some of the above the game semes to be working ok"
,oblus,2006-12-28T02:02Z,"SOLUTION - AND IT WORKS FINE !!!

Click the start button and click ""Run..."".
Typ ""regedit"" (without the quotes)
Go to the key HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion
In the right window doubleclick ""ProgramFilesDir"".
The value of ""ProgramFilesDir"" is probably ""C:\Program Files"". Change this to a drive with at least of 3 GB of free space. For example, I changed it to ""D:\Program Files"" (Make sure sutch folder exsists).
Install the game.
After you've Installed Joint Task force change the value of ""ProgramFilesDir"" back to ""C:\Program Files\"""
,Amirhosain,2007-01-22T07:46Z,"Hi friends, After installing the game and  downloading patches 1.1 & 1.2, it says for 1.1 ""wrong version, the patch can be installed only on version 1.0"", I found the registry key containing Hex & Dec values of version and but both show 1.0, but in the main menu of the game, the version is not ""1.00.0000"" and the build is not ""0"", it's wierd!
So I have 2 questions:
1) How can I change version of the game manually? (Where the version is saved?)
2) How can I extract files packed in the .exe patch files? (I tried winrar, but it can't unpack it)"
,_spiken_,2007-02-26T15:37Z,"I know i'm a bit late downloading this now, but please can't anyone seed. The file has been downloaded over 1000 times. Someone must have file."
,Niko2.0,2007-04-07T11:33Z,"please seed!
My download rate is at 0 kB/s

And i'm stuck at 98.5. Really annoying"
,Yellow13,2007-05-22T23:50Z,"Ok, well, I'm new to this torrent stuff so I have a question. How do I install this? It finished downloading in Azures and I have winrar, but what do I do?"
,Theodine,2007-08-19T05:26Z,"@ Amirhosain you have to take off all cracks you are using first and make sure that the original exe is there, then update to 1.1 then after thats done update to 1.2 then you rename the original exe and get a 1.2 fixed exe/crack.

@ Yellow13 you usualy just extract the first file (rar file) into a new directory and the rest should un-rar in sequence.  after this you get Demon tools or Magic-ISO and you can then mount the image. after this you should be able to install."
,brunodouglas,2007-09-06T00:45Z,"I've seen an excelent review about this game and i really would like to play it, but i've tried to download it over 3 weeks now, and all that i could get is to be stucked at 68% and there are no seeders to this torrent anymore (what is a shame since this game seems to has been downloaded more than 1166 times )

Sooo, finally, could some good soul please seed this game again??

Thanks in advance mates!
