,Utah_Mann,2008-08-20T22:18Z,"right..real player, but i think you need to convert them in order to burn to a dvd, is that right?"
,Fred3,2008-08-21T01:39Z,"Good enough torrent. Still sad that there are a few Real Media movies in there, don't like that."
,Legioner_mk,2008-09-13T19:01Z,"Can someone please tell me,someone who may have completed the download,how many episodes are there in this torrent?And are there only the Dragonball episodes or it also contains Dragonball Z and GT?? Tnx"
,Fred3,2008-10-21T17:40Z,Legioner_mk when you open the torrent in your torrent client you can see all this without having to download it at all.
,joda84,2008-11-10T08:53Z,It only includes the original Dragon Ball series. Z and GT are separate torrents.

,adamstru,2009-06-27T23:49Z,"Thanks, just watched Ep 1 and the quality's good. But I can't resist the temptation to ask how come the resolution in it is 640x*464* since the source most likely was 4:3. It's really no biggie, just curious... :p"
