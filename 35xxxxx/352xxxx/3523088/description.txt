Two Against Nature: Steely Dan's Plush TV Jazz-Rock Party In Sensuous Surround Sound delivers Walter Becker and Donald Fagen's characteristically witty (and plush) work in a live session recorded at New York's Sony Studios. As the title suggests, the notoriously concert-shy duo concentrate on songs from 2000's subtly charming Two Against Nature, including "Cousin Dupree," "What a Shame About Me," "Janie Runaway," and "Gaslighting Abbie," but they also return to classics like "Pretzel Logic," "Green Earrings," "Kid Charlemagne," "Babylon Sisters," and "Peg." More vivid than their 1995 live set Alive in America, Two Against Nature... finds a vibrant balance between Steely Dan's studio perfection and the immediacy of a concert, as well as their new and time tested material.
