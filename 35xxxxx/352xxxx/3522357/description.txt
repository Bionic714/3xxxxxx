Live set from the Stockholm Concert Hall 3rd Feb '72 features the classic line-up of Jimmy Dewar on bass and vocals, Bill Lordan on Drums and Robin Trower in fine form. 
There's some great stomping rock on this album though IMO the rendition of the slower track "Daydream" particularly shines.  Dewars vocal is powerfully sincere and Trowers  backing guitar is subtle and delicate, while his lead lines soar, with a fairly clean sound and amazing sustain.  A tour-de-force. 
I've loved this album for 30 years and I don't think there's a bad track on it.
