Have you ever wanted to start up or run your very own Triple Triad game on the internet?

If you have than there has probably been a site out there that has either (a) ran your good name through the mud. (b) stole all your ideas and used them for their own site. (c) stole your money and stiffed you for the bills (d) made up a much of lies about you and then banned you from their site just because you are trying to start your own game. or (e) all of the above.

If you answered yes to any of the above, than this is the torrent for you!

By using means that are a bit too technical. We have procured a full backup site rip of ttadvance.ca and ttnetwork.ca

All you need to run this is:

A Server that is running Mysql 3.23.58 and PHP 4.3.10.
Some spare time to edit the files to your liking.

I know what you are thinking. You are thinking that you don't have the time and/or the server to run your own Triple Triad game. But that's okay. You too can help by downloading, seeding and telling all your friends about this torrent.

The whole point of this is to send a message to the above site and it's admins that you can't go around and treat people that crap because karma will bite you in the ass sooner or later.

So my internet brothers and sisters, lets all band together and send the message that you can't do this to people. And please, by all means, enjoy this source code.
