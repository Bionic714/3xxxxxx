I started watching it not so long ago and I'm almost midway through season 2.  My favourite part so far has to be in episode 203, where he fights the big chicken cuz it gave him a bad coupon hahahahahaha.

Yea-
Don't use MP10. :)
Seriously, use Media Player Classic + FFDSHOW + CCCP (Community Codec Pack) and you should be able to play just about anything. You may have to actually learn a few things about turning codecs/on/off and prefer some over others...

,p0tat0eboy,2008-09-03T15:15Z,"Hey, 

I have a litle Problem,  it's probably because of codecs.

I wanted to burn these episodes and the movie to a DVD, so I could play it on my home DVD player.

I can't watch them on my PC, because I have a Pentium 3 and it has a hard time loading youtube videos.

I used Xilisoft AVI to DVD, and it failed at one point.

I used Magic video Converter's Burn function, and it also failed.

Any help or recommendations are welcome, Thank you"
