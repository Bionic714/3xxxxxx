,Cargonnas,2006-12-06T16:19Z,"This is a great Movie, I miss the old horror-flicks now'a'days there are to many CGI-monsters running around in this genre, in the old films there was the unseen malevolance and more of the occult. and this movie delivers just that.... pure evil and with a great and chilling feel to it... definatly worth seeing"
,bergatroll,2007-07-17T11:30Z,"I can't get this film to work, it shows George C. Scott in red after about 5 seconds and then it's black throughout the film, there is sound and I don't know what the problem is, it should work since they show the name in the beginning but I don't know.. Do any of you know?"

,themissingpatient,2009-08-07T07:54Z,"Over the last three years I made an independent horror film called 'Attic.' It is being released in film festivals across the US this fall and so far, the few people who have seen it, tell me it is very much like, this movie, The Changeling. Even on IMDb, it recommends The Changeling, at the bottom of the page for 'Attic.' The truth is, I've never even seen The Changeling! This is so strange, it's going to be very odd watching a movie with the same premise as mine... kinda scary, actually."
,m33rkat,2009-09-09T18:45Z,"Hi themissingpatient;) Do you know where I could find that movie ""Attic"" for download?"

,redfishone,2011-07-22T01:50Z,"Movie fuckin SUCKED! All in all, the download is pretty good considering the age of the movie. Thanks for the UL dahaulk.... Another added to the collection anyhow with pretty good AV."
,AJNorth,2012-03-30T10:25Z,"A nicely done thriller of the haunted house genre, sort of an amalgam of ""The Innocents"" (1961) and ""The Haunting"" (1963), though somewhat less stylized than either (and with more explicit violence). Very good transfer: A=9; V=9. Pity there wasn't more of the mighty Brahms 1st."
,binyo66,2012-04-22T07:05Z,thx
