,mmaraak,2006-09-11T16:08Z,"Haha... i knew finnish guys were crazy, but this makes Jackass look like kindergarden.. And the spoken language is really English not finnish..

I loved it when they light that guy on fire while hes sleeping."
,Biotekken,2006-09-12T23:24Z,"OMG what a bunch of freakin' loosers.

Wannabe Jackass, without the professionalism and security.

Maybe kids at 15 think this is cool, but hey, it's really not! Weee, look at me, I lost my thumb and broke all my bones and love trashing stuff. Aren't I cool?!

Again OMG!"
