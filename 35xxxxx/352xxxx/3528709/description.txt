Show number 21 of Theme Time Radio Hour hosted By Bob Dylan.
I know it is a lot later than usual this week but, either I am living in a different dimension to the rest of the world, or, it was released late this week?
Anyway enjoy.
Great quality, I grabbed the FLAC files from the digitally capped version and encoded with FHG to 160VBR Mp3.
Sounds fine!
