I have a question, though. Can you tell me where the XBMC saves the configuration, e. g. the options I change in the settings menu?"
,0rr,2006-09-11T14:49Z,"I have two bugs (which I found immediately).
The LED doesn't turn off if I adjust it to turn off when playing music and videos.
The automatic temperature control doesn't work properly. I put my CPU to 53째 and it keeps on 54째. I have to put it even lower to keep 53째.
The media player doesn't play vids from a dvd anymore. I put some vids there I took with a cam and it doesn't play them anymore. They don't have funny codecs or anything... just normal divX/Xvid. Nothing fancy but it doesn't show anymore, XMBC freezes then.

I think I'll wait for the next release and go back to September, 4th for now.

Btw., I like the re-arranging of the menus you've done. =)"
,0rr,2006-09-11T14:50Z,"That was three bugs, sorry. =)"
,Tcip,2006-09-12T21:04Z,Why all this bugs in the newer xbmc?! 
,0rr,2006-09-14T10:44Z,"I don't know. I am sure it was not on purpose. =)
I'm just waiting for the next release.

@gas: just wanted to say that I didn't just overwrite the old files on my xbox. I always delete the whole folder and put a new, clean xbmc version on my box.
one more error source you don't need to think about. =)"

,Tcip,2006-09-14T22:14Z,0rr - You need to clean e:\ to. It's like save games files there.
,0rr,2006-09-15T11:50Z,"Hmm, do you know exactly where XBMC saves anything? I don't wanto to lose my save games."
,Tcip,2006-09-17T19:54Z,"0rr - Yes. You can use this program: XBox-Saves Manager (http://www.megaxkey.com/downloads/XBSM451.zip). It's an lovley program, thats can take copy off all your save-games and delet"
,0rr,2006-09-19T11:05Z,I'll give it a try. Thanks. =)
