,koshman,2006-09-19T16:08Z,"Thanks man! Tie-Fighter is without doubt one of the best games ever released. X-Wing was also good, but a bit to difficult for my liking plus rebels... well, dark side is dark side :-) Havent played Alliance yet, but looking forward to. Thank you again."
,koshman,2006-09-19T22:43Z,And thanks once again for RARing the image files. Some people still dont get the fact that they can save up to 2/3 the size of a CD image by compressing... (or they re just 2 lazy)
,Phoenix_Hacker,2006-09-26T00:37Z,"Thanks for the torrent.  I'm having a bit of trouble installing XWA though.  After loading the disk image, I clicked on Install and the loader just freezes.  I've tried using both Power ISO and Daemon Tools and the same thing happens with both the .cue and the .bin.  I tried opening alliance.exe in compatibility "

...compatibility mode and the launcher stopped freezing but still didn't do anything.  It just closed."
,Threedots_dead,2006-10-28T02:57Z,"TIE-FIGHTER CTD FIX: If nothing happens when you run Tie-Fighter from the exe and an error message pops up, just run the exe in compatibility-mode (right-click,properties,compatibility-tab and then tick the first box and choose windows 95)

I curse myself for having lost my game cd."
,Indrid_Cold,2007-06-14T20:03Z,You should definitly write in HUGE letters: YOU MUST HAVE A JOYSTICK!!!!!! I just wasted many hours on this shit!
,spectre100,2007-07-13T07:10Z,"Firstly: he DID say you need a joystick.

Secondly: you clearly don't read the info posted with said torrent before blindly pressing the 'download me' button
this tells me you have more bandwidth than brains.

thirdly: Someone has offered a joystick EMULATOR for those of you who don't wanna go dump 20 bux into a shit-stick

and finally: don't dump on provider for not posting a TL;DR version of his comments along with the long drawn out comment he intended for you to read anyway.   he offers these up for us to enjoy.

,Threedots_dead,2007-07-19T20:50Z,"Thanks spectre, I really appreciate the support.

Indeed Indrid_Cold ( I liked that movie btw), if you had only checked two comments above you would have found an alternative for people without joysticks."

,mistic dragon,2007-10-31T20:36Z,works like a charm on vista just dont install direct x and after u install the game go to the .exe file to lunch the game right click go to properties and change the compatibility to windows 95 and ur set :) thanks threedots 
,akarikk,2008-01-12T04:51Z,"Hi, Thanks for share this great game, I own it but in DOS, and in 5 1/4 floppy disk :P, I didn't know about this version.

I have a problem whit the game,  the game runs but I have no sound, I put win95 compatibiliti mode in the exe.

Mi PC has Win xp, the rest i think isn't necesary to tell, cuz the requeriments for this games are so low.

Please can you help me getting sound in the game?, also Do the xwing, comes whit the 2 expansions (bwing, and other than right now i dont remembar the name)?"
,Threedots_dead,2008-01-17T02:45Z,"akarikk: I haven´t run across this problem unfortunately, but it could have something to do with XP compatibility. Try running the XP-patch. You can find the link further up in the comments. "
,Threedots_dead,2008-01-20T23:41Z,"Henry6:
Yes, I never played the old version with sound, but as far as I understand it they did some fancy things with the midi engine basically creating a dynamic soundtrack. The old diskette-version can be found in various torrents on the web.

And yeah, XWvTF is strangely difficult to get a hold of..."
,Threedots_dead,2008-01-20T23:56Z,"If you´re having problems with the ""PPjoy"" joystick-emulator, you can try this little program which is said to work great:

,CptNeutral,2008-02-17T20:17Z,"Hi. Thanks for this torrent, looking forward to playing it.

I've got the whole joystick emulation working (thanks for that too), but i can't run the game - it's not picking up the CD, even though i've got it set up using daemon tools.

Just wondering how you got it working."
,nova2futura,2008-03-09T23:11Z,"Hello, I would like to know if someone has downloaded the compatibility fix from http://www.lucasfiles.com/index.php?s=&action=file&id=653, since this link gives a server error message.
If yes would it be possible to upload it as a torrent?
Thank you."
,Deputy276,2008-06-17T17:52Z,"I got everything working. But I am curious....what is the second disk for in X-Wing Alliance? Everything installed on the first disk.
I never played X-Wing Alliance, but even at ""Easy"" level it's nearly impossible to hit anything. Everything is just way too fast to target. Also, the invulnerability setting in X-Wing Alliance doesn't seem to work. I still crash into things and die. I also had some problems with my gamepad as far as selecting what function the joysticks on it controlled. Had to quit and restart to get it right. 
If someone can post the no-CD cracks, that would also be helpful. It's a great torrent and thanks for posting t.

,Drkmage,2008-07-21T05:31Z,So I'm running Vista and I'm able to mount Tie Fighter fine but when I click install Vista is telling the setup program was unable to launch and to make sure the CD is in the drive.. Can anyone help?

IMO, yes! In fact, I just bought one!"
,HobFlob,2008-09-04T20:31Z,When I launch the game from the .exe file it says I dont have a joystick plugged in and shuts down. It´s the same from the launch icon. I just want to see that it actually works before I go buy a joystick....?? (my old one when I played this loong ago is lost somewhere..)

Im having trouble with daemontools, i can not mount the cue or bin files, it just shows the xwing folder and then will not display the cue or bin files I know they're there, i can access them in winrar  but cannot mount then into daemontools.  Ive tried copying and pasting it and renaming the files but nothing works, WTF?
does any one know what im doing wrong?
am i just retarded?
all i want to do is restore peace and order to the galaxy!!"
,corvak,2008-10-15T02:28Z,"Have to say I like TIE Fighter more than X-Wing.
The noise of the TIE fighter engines is one of those sound effects that everybody can recognize :)  Evil always wins, because good is dumb.

If you don't have a joystick - remember that a standard corded Xbox 360 controller is compatible with XP or Vista. (Wireless controllers require an accessory)

It's not as good as a real joystick, but it's a cheap option if you already have a 360 controller around."
,cwg138,2009-01-12T02:09Z,"Tie Fighter worked great on xp here. FYI if you don't have a joystick/flight-stick, you can download a little program called 'xpadder'. This program works outside all others and binds keys to a joypad.  I use a logitech Ps2-like joypad and the analog stick works the same as a joystick control.  Perfect for this game. Simply find out which are the default control keys in the game, then exit out and program the xpadder accordingly. Re-enter game and viola!Check it out. Koodos Threedots"

I'm going to buy a joystick, coz mouse is too inaccurate, but importantly:
Is there any way to get the music to run properly in Tie Fighter, like it always did?
I miss that, or has it been removed from the game??"

Wanted to buy one myself but I'm not sure on what works, what's good etc."
,urf-urf,2009-07-23T02:54Z,"If your check out the Wikipedia articles about these games (e.g. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_TIE_Fighter) you'll find out why getting the *older* CD versions of X-Wing and Tie Fighter from 1994 and 1995 instead of this 1998 collection is such a big deal, although if you haven't actually seen the older and better versions it may be hard to understand all the fuzz.

The older CD editions are expanded and improved, yet old skool in a good way. The games look and feel much more alive, while the '98 versions are something the company just threw together. The older editions have tons of classic, sweet, meticulously drawn pixel graphics and lots of cool little atmospheric animation here and there, while this version has something the artists had to come up with in a day or two because the resolution needed to be higher.

And I'm not even going to mention the lost midi soundtrack.

Like Threedots_dead said, the floppy releases are available in other torrents. But that's not exactly what I'm looking for.

I'm downloading a couple of torrents right now, hoping that maybe they are the real thing -- I'll let you know if I learn something."
,urf-urf,2009-07-23T18:36Z,"I found the '94 cd version here (even though it says 1992 for some reason):

,battle21,2009-12-26T08:59Z,you can use a gamepad its almost like a joystick
,battle21,2009-12-31T05:52Z,If you dont hear any souind. Use DOSBox to run tie fighter and x wing.  It worked on my pc with DOSBox. It has sound but a little laggy
,Syberia22,2010-05-06T00:42Z,"In order to get these to install on 64-bit versions of Windows, you may have to download the custom .msi installers here:

http://www.markusegger.at/Software/Games.aspx

and follow the instructions to create new installation folders (you can ignore the part about burning them to CD, they work just fine when left in folders) from the files on the disc images in this torrent.

The original installers present in this torrent were written in ancient 16-bit code, and do not work on 64-bit operating systems."
,quietID,2010-07-25T15:28Z,Can't believe there are updated versions which run in XP and I didn't know. Wow. So down with this. I never played any subsequent entries in this series. X Wing was the first game I ever bought as a kid and I played it for years.
