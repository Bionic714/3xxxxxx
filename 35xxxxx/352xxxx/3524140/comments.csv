AVG found that virus in the 
x:\Crack\GTR2.exe file included on the .iso"
,McKain1,2012-01-07T03:03Z,When an uploader is found to have placed a Virus in a folder He/She should have all their files deleted by TPB. 
,tpboss,2012-02-05T20:56Z,"WOW. The file was fine, no viruses, clean install, but the game! If you're looking for a game like NFS or something like that where its a game, not a simulation, I would highly suggest you do not get this game. I'm sure to the right people this game is amazing, but for those of us who just want to wreck, go fast and what not, ohhhh no. Not this game. Far too professional for me."

,pdubbs7,2012-07-13T16:55Z,"Torrent works but I have one problem. There are no driving school challenges? In each category it shows 0/0 challenges complete, not 0/1 or whatever. When I go into I can't click attempt button, and without these challenges complete, I can't unlock all custom championships? What do I do?"
