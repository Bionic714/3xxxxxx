Captain Insano are a metal band hailing from Co.Cork in Ireland and formed about 2 years ago from the seeds of various other bands. After a few member changes Captain Insano have never settled on a sound that they are happy with and will continue to experiment and evolve as a unit. In 2005, Captain Insano released their E.P. ''The Inevitable Conclusion To A Wasted Life'', from which 'Doombuggy' is taken. Download it, if you have balls of steel. We're about to release our new EP, 'Howtofakeyourowndeath', it's gonna be the tits. It should be out in late April, providing it's mastered on time. We'll keep you posted.
