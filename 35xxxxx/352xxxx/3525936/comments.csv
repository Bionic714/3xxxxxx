,anton87,2006-09-18T22:42Z,"Please seed asap.

I would kill for this :)"
,anton87,2006-09-18T22:46Z,"Note to seeder:
Since this is your first time, there might be some confusion; uploading the torrent to TPB.org isn't enough. You have to keep the torrent open, so the people that want the file can get it from you."
