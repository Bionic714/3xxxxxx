Synopsis

Brazil is a surrealistic nightmare vision of a "perfect" future where technology reigns supreme. Everyone is monitored by a secret government agency that forbids love to interfere with efficiency
Jonathan Pryce and Robert DeNiro star with Michael Palin in this chilling black comedy directed by former Monty Python member Terry Gilliam.
When a daydreaming bureaucrat becomes unwittingly involved with an underground superhero and a beautiful mystery woman, he becomes the tragic victim of his own romantic illusions.
This offbeat fantasy blends biting humor with an unforgettable look at a delightfully dastardly tomorrow.
