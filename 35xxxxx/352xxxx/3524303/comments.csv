,vinylking,2006-09-15T11:08Z,"No, it's ABBA! Haven't you heard of ABBAS great White Album from the late sixties?"
,alcocops,2006-09-15T13:36Z,"No, it can't be ABBA. The singers are all male and sound English. One of the songs is 'Ob La Di Ob La Da' which was a hit by Marmalade so it's probably them."
