,gojiraeight,2008-05-25T19:29Z,Butlerian Jihad chapters are all out of order. Starts with a chapter towards the end of the book than skips back to the middle of chapter 1. Opening chapter by Princess Irulan is missing. Also the entire thing is either incomplete and/or abridged as most of the chapters start in the middle of the book chapters. Not even going to bother looking at the others.
