UK power-trio of great talent, the Hamsters play a range of original material and covers.  This is their live CD of original rock and r&B "They Live By Night"
These guys are powerful! Ultra tight and not as well known as they richly deserve, they aren't tied to any major label AFAIK preferring from the outset to plough their own furrow.  
Lead vocalist Slim is an exceptionally talented guitarist. The band also do a set of ZZTop covers and another magnificent set of Hendrix covers. 

Check out their website for more details. 

Enjoy! .....and Play It Loud!  :-)
