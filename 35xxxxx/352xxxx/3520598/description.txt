When a private laboratory supported by the government finds the cure for the mutants, using the DNA of a powerful boy, the mutants have the option of giving up their powers and become human, but their society split. Magneto (Ian McKellen) opposes and decides to join a force to fight against the government and kill the mutant boy. Meanwhile, Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) resurrects uncontrolled by Xavier and with the personality of the powerful Dark Phoenix. She destroys Cyclops (James Marden) and Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart), and allies to the evil forces of Magneto, making them almost invincible.
