,snakebtr,2006-09-24T19:20Z,"Ok, I am uploading 4mb / sec constantly but cant keep it up for too long though due to previous ISP-problems....

Please seed after you have downloaded this one."
,raisak,2006-09-24T19:34Z,Awesome work mate! 
,Jindohexxer,2006-09-24T21:37Z,"Appreciated.

Especially since Fight+ channel managed to air wrestling when UFC63 was scheduled last night. Someone at Canal Digital is overdue for some ass kicking."
,kep0ne,2006-09-24T22:17Z,Please seed this after you are done. Seed/Leech ratio sucks right now.
,snakebtr,2006-09-24T22:49Z,I had to reduce my speed to 400k / sec up since I have my isp after me. All I can do..sorry.

,snakebtr,2006-09-25T12:39Z,"Well I uploaded 4mb/ sec for the first 4-5 hours but had to go down to 450k / sec after that due to my chasing me already as it is.

Should pick up soon I hope."
