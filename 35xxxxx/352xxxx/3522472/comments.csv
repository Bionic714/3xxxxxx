,gLITZ1987,2008-10-13T10:19Z,"Great movie, wow.
And FINALLY I find the one with the ""proper"" ending. My girlfriend has bought the ""director's cut"" version which has 2 endings but both of them suck.
This one's the most satisfying:) and a great song too."

going to download anyway, because it is an amzing film."
