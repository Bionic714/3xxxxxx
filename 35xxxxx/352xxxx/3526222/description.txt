    and you never need activate the windows.


NOTES: The Windows desktop Control Panel button don't work after you disable the activate service; than you need create a folder to copy and paste the control panel files before disable the activate service. This way you can to have access all control panel files click in shortcut.
        
       The Aero Glass sometimes is not active in Windows Vista registered. You have to active the aero glass in: Control panel/Personalization/Windows color and appearence: choose in box "Windows Aero", click  "apply" and "OK". You need do it before disable the activation service, because later the system don't allow this change.
