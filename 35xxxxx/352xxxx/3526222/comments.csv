 control panel doesn't work and you have to make a folder with shortcuts to ever turn it on again. i also couldn't run games, windows update, backup and restore center, personalize.. basically, most of the os features. so you have the system loading, probably running installed apps and games, playing music or films, but sort of blocked."
