,XenuTheMagnificent,2006-09-10T15:34Z,"flowerpoop I upload these all the time and you're the first person ever to say it doesn't work. I'm going to have to say I know for a fact it does in fact work, as a matter of fact i'm watching it right now on my tivo, so if it's not working for you then it's definitely user error."
,XenuTheMagnificent,2006-09-10T15:38Z,flowerpoop oh I see now. I just went and looked at all the other ones uploaded here and you upped them. I guess you're just mad I uploaded it before you. Sorry I beat you to it but to say it dosent work is really just childish because I uploaded it before you. Wow all I have to say to you now is you are really just a jackass!
,flowerpoop,2006-09-10T16:01Z,"Nope, sorry. Completely my fault. It wasn't properly downloaded."
