,bionaire,2006-09-25T01:51Z,"I see from how many people downloading this file that my message that the file is corrupt has not been read.

So I'll say it again. You will all be disappointed when it's fully downloaded because you've wasted your time downloading a corrupt rar file. And the file repair tools I've tried have told me it is unrecoverable.

Have fun."
