,redvex,2006-09-14T20:02Z,this keygen works perfectly for activation
,Bohous78,2006-09-16T00:19Z,"I encounter install problems
When I finish install (I followed the instruction carefully) it all seems ok but when I launch PS a message appears saying ""the serial number has expired""
I thought there were traces of the previous CS2 version (the english one) SO I delete ALL adobe files from my iBook 
Trying to install it again but...nothing, just the same message
Now I cannot restore the previous working version neither, the same message appears
Someone can help me?!?
Thanks"
