,thecableguy003,2006-10-19T09:45Z,"Hi.... for people suffering with crashes when trying to create a new player.... I am assuming you have moved your ""My Documents"" folder onto a seperate partition as I had done. Thanks to EA's coding you will need to restore the whole ""my documents"" folder back to it's default location. Just right click on My Documents, Properties, then restore default.
This worked a treat for me. You can find the original thread on the EA Forums here http://forum.easports.co.uk/viewtopic.php?t=9819&postdays=0&postorder=asc&start=15

The solution is to run autorun.exe in

file on the DVD , go to the shortcuts properties and choose to run the file 
in Win 2000 compatability mode . This will install the game correctly , by-passing the faulty DX9 check , you can then run the game normally "
