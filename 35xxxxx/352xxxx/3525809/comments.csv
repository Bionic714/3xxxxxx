,BleedingCello,2006-09-22T14:10Z,"OK, after much fiddling with this file, I must say, this is more like Company of Fools.  I mean no offense to whomever released this, and it may work on some machines somehow.  

I've tried both WinRAR and 7-ZIP, and both give me CRC errors (Cyclic Reduncany Check).  But that's not even my gripe.  Its one single large .rar file, that when extracted becomes 256 smaller .rar files (double-compression=never good)

And 256 pieces?  I understand its over 3gigs, but other releases (which I'm now downloading and have been named above) only have 76 peices.

And it's not like the the sizes even matter, except maybe when downloading, which might be why this torrent was slow.  But when it doesn't work, and start to wonder why, then 256 little peices becomes appearent.  Considering I just unRAR'd a huge 3gig chunk already.

So, as it stands, this doesn't work, at least not for me,  Sgt Hardon, Kollekanin, or tzare.   And why there's more than 700 people on this torrent is beyond me.

I know I don't post or comment much, but I have to in this case, dissappiontment after downloading 3+gb kinda sucks.

And again, no offense to the Psyfer team, keep doing what you do...."

,Syltloken,2006-10-25T20:06Z,why doesn't the *.iso file work when I've unrared it?
[V],Murlok,2006-11-25T11:52Z,Rarfiles are fucked up no use take another
