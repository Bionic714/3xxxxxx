In 1975, Putumayo began as a Latin American import shop in New York city. In 1997, we return to our roots with an album featuring exceptional Latin artists, great salsa and other Latin rhythms garanteed to have you dancing. 
"Latino! Latino!" features Latin legends Oscar D'Leon, Willie Colon and Pancho Sanchez along with exceptional cross-cultural fusion such as Ricardo Lemvo's Afro-latin rhythms, Manzanita's Spanish flamenco rumba and Kaoma's unique cha cha cha. 
Latin music has been growing in popularity everywhere. As with Gloria Estefan's Latin albums, "Cubanismo" and other crossover efforts, we believe "Latino! Latino!" will help build Latin fever for hundreds of thousands of people.
