Syware Visual CE 9.1 Personal Edition.

Improve the way you gather, integrate, organize, and share information. Visual CE is sophisticated enough for developers and easy enough for new users.

Use Visual CE, the award winning, "Go Anywhere" database, to build the perfect mobile database applications for Windows Mobile, Pocket PC, or Windows CE devices quickly and easily. Eliminate paperwork and improve data accuracy, even centralize data. Simply decide what information you'll need, then drag and drop controls to create your custom electronic form, no programming required. After your data is collected, synchronize your device with your desktop PC or corporate server. Share data with popular ODBC-enabled software like Microsoft Access, SQL Server, Sybase, Oracle, or Visual Basic.

    "Visual CE offers a rapid and stable path to our mobile healthcare application that is 10 times faster than traditional development products such as Visual Basic or Visual C++. I can choose from a list of command sequences for functions like sorting, filtering, or communications. I don't have to write all the code behind the command buttons. It's already done in Visual CE."
    -- Chuck Colley, President of Biologix-IT
