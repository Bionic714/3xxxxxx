,LordP666,2006-09-12T19:50Z,"First I want to thank ulysses56 for uploading these, it seems that he had a hard time with
it but he still did it. Thanks.

OK, I think I found a solution for those having a problem with the Anatomy Primal CDs. This
works for me at least and if someone else could try it and let us know if it works for them
it would be a good thing.

I'm going to illustrate with ""Anatomy Primal 3D Interactive Series 3 Hands"" which is the
only one I have as of now.


Use Magic ISO and extract all the files to a folder.

Use ""Safedisc 2 Cleaner v1.2.0"" to clean ""hand2000.exe"" which is in the ""setup"" folder
- the cleaner will make a file called ""SD2cleaned.exe"" for you to test.

When you run this test file it will tell you that it can't find ""APPSETUP.TXT"" (it's in
the ""shared"" folder). What I did is to tell it where to find APPSETUP.TXT and it worked
like a charm.

Just to be safe I placed a copy of ""APPSETUP.TXT"" to the ""setup"" folder.

Now all I had to do is delete ""hand2000.exe"", rename ""SD2cleaned.exe"" to ""hand2000.exe""
and burn the whole thing to a CD using the original CD name of ""HAND2000"".

Works nice.

You can find the cleaner here: w w w.cdmediaworld.com/hardware/cdrom/cd_utils.shtml"

,mazdon,2006-09-17T18:04Z,"What a sad story.... hmmm
I can get some of these torrent to work... with a lot of trouble.... burning CD:s that doesent work, loading down diffrent programs that doesen´t work to crack this torrent...so sad, I really looked forward to get this torrents as I have a lot of friends that are nurses or working in that area.
But I can see that it will be far to complicated for them to manage this downloads.... so sad.... ;(

Anyway ulysses56, thanks for trying...best regards Maxthegun"
,Alexiito,2009-02-05T17:36Z,"Hi have solved the problem!

Konvert all de sec. (knee, hip,shoulder, etc) to iso. file with poweriso! 
Extraxt them to new folder.
Then mount them with alcohol 120% (NOT the HIP, KNEE or SHOULDER!!)
And every time you would like to use one of the programs mount them with Alcohol120%

And for the KNEE, HIP and SHOULDERS mount them with Daemon tools Lite but you´ll have to set the ""emulation settings"" on ALL OPTIONS ON!! (safedisc,securom,laserrom and etc!!
and its the same there, you´ll have to mount them on daemon tools if you want to use them.

PS: the HAND program doesn´t work for me. It ask for appsetup.txt

I´ve hope I have helped you!! =D"
,bobmarley2,2010-10-25T21:56Z,"So how have people got this to work.  Done everything that LordP666 said and still can't get the program to find appsetup.txt.

Is there another way???  Would love to get this working  "
