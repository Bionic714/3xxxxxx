Gothic Melancholy Vol.13 - Home made compilation by AssMaster
Released at The Pirate Bay

Quality differs from 128 kbps to vbr ~200 kbps, most songs
are around 192 kbps though. I haven't ripped these tunes,
they're picked from various albums, both scene and non-scene
releases. I take only credit for compiling the albums.

The songs are picked by me, and are for my listening pleasures,
so if you don't like them, I don't care. I you DO like them,
you're more than welcome to write a comment at TPB :)
The genres varies from gothic rock, metal, electronic and
death metal, all with the gothic feeling :)

Since a couple of the albums' torrents disappeared, I'm upping
vol 11-13 in one torrent. Vol 13 is brand new! ;)

Enjoy the stuff, and help to seed when done, as always :)
