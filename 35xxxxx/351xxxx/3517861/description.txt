Here it is again folks. Sorry about the problems with last weeks edition, the file somehow got corrupt. No such worries this time anyway!
The theme is \'Radio\' and the show is a damn good one.
160K/bps 44,000hz MP3 converted from the FLAC files that were done from a direct digital satellite broadcast. 
Ciao.
