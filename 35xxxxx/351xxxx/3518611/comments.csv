,zerolimit23,2006-09-02T23:49Z,anyone have a key for this? or activation crack?
,Hosser,2006-09-02T23:56Z,"This will be released to the public via the CPP program next week, just like Beta 2 was. 

Just wait until then - you'll get your own legal key which will make activation possible, and you'll also be able to download it at 150kbps+ from Microsoft's dedicated servers. =]"
,zerolimit23,2006-09-02T23:58Z,I wasnt a beta tester so thats why i need a key!
,ruva,2006-09-03T00:27Z,I hav been a beta tester sens I bought windows XP 2001 :)
,Ior_2,2006-09-03T01:26Z,Thanks!
,revenge7,2006-09-03T04:15Z,post your email address and I will send you an email with a product key.
,mimi007,2006-09-03T07:09Z,"is this dvd? do i need a key for this?

thx"
,BuK0,2006-09-03T07:35Z,"its dvd iso , for the cd key i dont know , i use one cd key for all versions of vista from 1 year and its working :)"
,BuK0,2006-09-03T07:42Z,"use this cd key - 

PVYFQ-2JTBV-9KXQ2-FQHDY-MTBVH
"
,KennyM,2006-09-03T08:18Z,Do you have the x64 edition too?
,ericcarr,2006-09-03T11:06Z,"I have used this key. 
PVYFQ-2JTBV-9KXQ2-FQHDY-MTBVH

It works to install it. It's only activated for 3 days though."
,fez?,2006-09-03T11:15Z,Is there coming a activation crack soon? 
,Gleeed,2006-09-03T12:03Z,Can someone upload x64 please?
,lioncat,2006-09-03T12:07Z,"you can install it, you can use serialkey.....but you CANT have it property without activation....so what ever its useless...whats the point install...for 10days.....what i can see nobody on TPB ever have activation it as a proper OS"
,az5,2006-09-03T16:53Z,"Beta 2 testers can use their keys, I have one. Too bad if you don't ;)

The new CPP will open within a few days anyway."
,skowfritt,2006-09-04T00:39Z,SLReArmWindows will reset vista for another 10 days and it can be done indefinitely.
,Aenimal,2006-09-04T05:51Z,"Here's my method:
1. Install using PVYFQ-... key. Make sure to uncheck ""Automatically activate Windows when online"" (something like that) when installing, it's under the product key field!
2. You've got 14 days. Make a .BAT file as described here: http://elliottback.com/wp/archives/2006/04/08/vista-bug-1-can-i-can-i/ (July 8th, 2006 at 5:17 pm comment) and run it as administrator to reset activation clock to 14 days indefinitely."
,mr.arne,2006-09-04T11:41Z,"There's a X64-version available at isohunt.com.
Go search for ""Vista RC1"" and you will find it."
,Arthinel,2006-09-05T14:26Z,"Men, if u wanna no **ck with activation, just use illegal key (upper in comments) and then, when vista is installed, call Microsoft's activation service by telephone. As for me, operator had just told me the key is needed for my machine, i wrote it, and it is f***ing working!!"
,Sontiago,2006-09-07T04:06Z,"Has anyone used this iso sucessfully? I burnt it twice and can't get past 49 percent saying ""corrupt files detected""... the x64 one worked perfectly and is so much faster I'm amazed..."

,Windir1184,2006-09-07T08:37Z,"This is full and working perfectly =)
Just go Run: 

'rundll32 slc.dll,SLReArmWindows'

Without inverted commas.
There you have Vista RC1 5600 ;)
It's amazing!"
,Pope John Paul 2,2006-09-07T15:43Z,"Hey there fellow sharers...

Some feedback on my experience:
Installed Vista Ultimate x32 and activated it no problem (using call to India method). Only my Mass Storage driver doesn?t work (even after search updates). Works smoothly enough and looks great. So far (3 days and counting) no hiccups whatsoever. Many progs are still incompatible (latest versions usually: Nero Ultra 7, Driver genius, Scan Soft, Mcafee, Tuneup Utilities 2006. Al the Powerquest suite, Drive Image 7, Reg Mechanic etc... In fact, all those complex yet non-vital works that help while away the long evenings fiddling in cyber space!). it sure is a sweet piece of software, but buy it? No, not for a while - too many of my fav progs don?t match.
If you haven?t seen the list of compatible units, there are some helpful points to be learnt: e.g. older (3.33) Deamon Tools works etc... 
If anyone knows of a good Vista tune-up software that can change things like internet speed optimisation (as TuneupUtils or TweakPro could) I would be grateful.
Overall, a great improvement, but best to keep dual boot for awhile..     "
,XiXiX,2006-09-08T16:58Z,"Hi guys!... 

My question is where can I buy a new cd key to Windows Vista RC1 or just get a new one? doesnt matter for me just a new CD key..."
,PureChaosX,2006-09-08T20:37Z,"So, basically, Microsoft doesn't know the Windows version you are activating over the phone? Just says it's XP Pro and they will be none the wiser? But all-in-all, does this work well?"
,stubbis_jr,2006-09-11T20:25Z,"I actually don't like the new Vista.... And a WARNING to all of you: when you install it, ALL of your files will be deleted, the hard drive will be EMPTY!"
,RobNyc,2006-09-11T22:55Z,"Damn. I need to get a product key if you guys said PVYFQ-2JTBV-9KXQ2-FQHDY-MTBVH will only last 3 days.. I'm installing Vista currently, before I was getting a lil problem with the partition I don't know why. 

So where can we all get official product key the right way?"
,RobNyc,2006-09-11T22:56Z,we need to set up an irc channel for talks .. how about .. irc.r-type.ca #vista or irc.macspeak.net #vista or irc.freenode.net #vista
,CaribouLou,2006-09-12T01:37Z,"I seem to not be smart enough to run this.  I burned the iso file onto a dvd.  When I put the disc into a drive all I can extract is a readme saying this disc contains a UDF file.  Can someone point me in the right direction?  email me at CaribouLou5 at msn dot com, or post a reply.

Oh and THANKS!"
,sidewinder310,2006-09-12T17:35Z,"Use this url and select location to get a key...

http://www.laboratoire-microsoft.org/n/22215/

enjoy."
,xerberos,2006-09-12T22:23Z,"Download it from here instead: 
http://download.windowsvista.com/preview/rc1/en/download.htm

With the Akamai download manager you'll get it faster than with the torrent. I got it in less than one hour.

And then get your own real key using the link that sidewinder310 provides in his comment. No need to mess around with some hack.

That's all you need."
,the living hell,2006-09-13T16:58Z,hello i did download the NvIDIA driver for this and then i did restart my computer and i get the fucking bluescreen what did i do wrong
,the living hell,2006-09-13T17:15Z,ops did forget dos enyone now a anti-virus for vista:)
,Enigma of Reality,2006-09-13T21:36Z,"When you go to:

http://www.laboratoire-microsoft.org/n/22215/ 

Go through the registration process with the e-mail verification and everything.  Then when you get to the screen with your product key and the download links, copy the key listed and then hit refresh on the page and a NEW key will appear!  Now you have 2 REAL PERSONAL product keys.  *Hint: If it doesn't put a new key the first time you refresh try a few more times... it will show a new one.  Also... I've only been able to get it to show me 2 total keys.  But, if you sign up for a bunch of hotmail addresses and do this method you could have endless product keys.  So... if your product key ""runs out"" you have backups :)"
,Enigma of Reality,2006-09-13T21:38Z,"****NOTE****
Windows Vista RC1 can be installed and activated on up to 10 PCs using with one Product Key. "
,sidewinder310,2006-09-16T13:19Z,"I have just noticed ms has just opened up the Customer Preview Progam to the public.

Just go to: 

http://www.microsoft.com/windowsvista/getready/preview.mspx

I haven't tried this yet but you should get a working key to activate vista, and it should be faster to download from here, than using a torrent.

Have fun ;-)"
