,ressington,2006-09-28T12:33Z,does anyone know if there is a crack for the updated version of badder adder?
,DavidatMPA,2006-10-03T15:48Z,"I was wondering the same thing as well.

It looks like myspace has made some updates, that prevent a few featuers in badder adder 2.0...but the new version appears to have fixed these problems."
,botreviewer,2006-10-11T00:15Z,"yea thats the problem with getting cracked versions of these adders, they have to update a lot to stay current with myspace's bulletin updates and captcha updates. I review all these kind of programs over @ http://www.botreviewer.com and yea, its a pain to update these progs even if you have legit versions. "
,batdave0,2006-11-16T19:18Z,This version has been discontinued and will not work.
