,symetric,2006-08-23T21:24Z,"Weird. I've been seeding this for a couple of days now (22GB's), but it still says that i'm not seeding. Most peculiar. Download anyway. You should be able to connect."

awesome band...grew up one town over from them...still see the lead singers parents at the XXX diner every now and then."
