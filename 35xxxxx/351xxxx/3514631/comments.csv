,cypher35,2006-09-01T02:29Z,"Just FYI, Earthbound is NOT by daft punk.  It is a self-titled album by a swedish techno group of the same name...

Also, you appear to be missing the album ""Human After All"""

,raptor550,2007-01-22T00:18Z,"Ok, the quality is good... but your missing one of the biggest albums.  Its weak that this is the only popular Daft Punk torrent on this page.  Also cypher35 do you have any more info on this ""Earthbound"" album?  I am actually really liking it and would like to know more."
