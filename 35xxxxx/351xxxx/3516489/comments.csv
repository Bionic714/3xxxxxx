,em0rox,2010-07-07T13:11Z,"Episode 2 does not work in some players, out of the 3 I tried 2 of them the video would freeze every few seconds while the audio played, the other would play in sync but because very blocky/pixelated a LOT. If you actually watch stuff like this on a computer with the proper codecs you should be fine.

The rest of the episodes seem to work fine."
,em0rox,2010-07-13T00:41Z,"Nevermind, the last episode wouldn\'t play at all in any divx player I tried and even on a computer with all supporting codecs it froze and skipped so much it was almost unwatchable. Also the guy cut off all the credits too which is very annoying..."
