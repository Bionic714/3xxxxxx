As the filename says this is a cap of Dolphins @ Bucs from week 2 of the NFL 2006 preseason.

Was capped at 450Kbit/sec. Quality is decent. The file includes partial pregame show, the game itself as well as partial postgame show.

To view the file use Winamp 5.xx (works on latest 5.24 Pro).

Enjoy...	


IMPORTANT INFORMATION
Jump (CTRL+J) to 15:25 for the partial pregame show.
The postgame show ends abruptly at 208:52.

Due to me messing up while scheduling the recording all video after 208:52 is unrelated to the game. This is the reason for the large filesize and since NSV files can't be edited I'm unable to remove it. Take it or leave it.

This time I recommend you stay and SEED after you complete the download. Otherwise the next two Bucs pregames will not be shared on TPB. YOU decide.
