,quisla,2006-09-04T16:31Z,I get file error when trying to download this. Maybe name is too long or something else is wrong with some of the file names. Suggestions?
,boingo,2006-09-07T09:21Z,"Hydrogen isn't a fuel, it's a battery.  You have to use electricity to separate the hydrogen from water, so just use an electric vehicle.  No pumping and shipping of hydrogen.

Electricity can be shipped on wires, no pipes, no tankers.  That's huge wasted energy.

Duh."

,quisla,2006-09-10T14:09Z,"Hey ReVIsed, thank you for interesting stuff.

I reported a problem with the download. I think I know the problem now.
Turning of the download of the files
Engine_Fundamentals_Class_Part-2....
Engine_Fundamentals_Class_Part-3....
will make the download start.
It seems as if these file names are so long that  an error is generated.
Probably not a problem for Linux users though. I use BitComet and if anyone can recommend what Bittorrent program to use for winXP - please do. I would hate to miss those 2 files."
,ReVIsed,2006-09-10T16:33Z,quisla: Try to make the path as short as possible. E.g: C:/Incoming . I think that will solve your problem
,quisla,2006-09-10T17:09Z,"I already tried that and it is not enough. I did however - after getting the error message - manage to continue downloading with the 2 files turned on. If I will get them remains to be seen. 
Only one of them appears in the directory although still empty. You may consider archiving if you decide to repost the torrent in the future. If it is archived the name length will be a problem once the files are already downloaded and the name issue can be resolved whilst unpacking."
,Tripled,2006-09-11T19:19Z,"i inadvertantly placed an "":"" in the file name which i believe win does not like.

Azureus lets you rename the file to download."
,Hyperi0n_Supreme,2006-09-11T22:02Z,"Boingo, your mentality is highly limited.
You assume hydrogen car is synonymous with fuel cell electric car.
Break the chains of assumptions in your own mind, and open up whole new ways of thinking about things. No offense intended, I'm learning to decondition my mind as well.
-----

A hydrogen powered car is either one of two things; an electric car with a fuel cell for electric power, or an internal combustion engine running with hydrogen as a fuel source. The big automotive manufactures have shown both types. In their modal of how things should be, the hydrogen required to fuel the vehicle is stored onboard in compressed tanks. Of course, when you run out, you go buy more from a fuel station, just like you do now for gasoline. It is not very practical or safe.

There is a much better way, and its not going to be developed by any existing entrenched corporation as it removes '$$$$' profitability from there business modal.
The better way is to simply split the water into hydrogen and oxygen in the vehicle as its needed by the engine. Fueling your car up is as simple as adding water, and no dangerous amounts of hydrogen need to be stored.

Using the limited means available by conventional science, it takes more energy to split the water into hydrogen and oxygen then you get out of it. Obviously, to be practical you would need to generate far more energy then you put into it.

So then, it comes prudent to ask: is there anyway to split water using less energy then you can get out of hydrogen?
And this is where heads clash, hair is pulled, names are called, and people get upset.

Stanley Meyers, for example, modified a little air-cooled vw engine to run on water, and put it in a road legal dune buggy.  He demonstrated his car, and went into production of an inexpensive kit to modify any internal combustion engine. His technology replaced the spark plugs in the vehicle with what I'm guessing was a combination water splitter, injector, and ignitor. Unfortunately, he answered the door to his house one day, and was shot dead. I'll leave it as an exercise to the reader to figure out who would benefit from the suppression of this technology.

A simple Google search for water powered car brings up lots of results, including videos.

,quisla,2006-09-11T23:40Z,"OK I now have the 2 files with long names. This info may be helpful to those that have similar problems. The first one, ..part2, I managed to coax BitComet into downloading, but to get the second one, ...part3, I had to use uTorrent. I will probably switch completely to uTorrent to avoid such problems in the future."
,Mimih,2006-12-14T15:19Z,"Ok... a little more seeding and we can all watch, then discuss ;)

The file names may be strange, but get a better client or operating system, and it will not be a problem. (And the torrent-makers *could* refrain from using : in file names, it's a known no-no)"
,talhead,2008-06-16T20:23Z,"Here is additional information for converting gasoline and diesel powered cars and trucks for Hydrogen supplement.

Easy to do!!

Did you know that you can convert your car or truck to a water-burning vehicle (Water Hybrid)?
Convert Your Car/Truck to BURN WATER as well as Gasoline--Double Your Mileage!

The website here offers information. It is not free, but put here for your reading and information gathering, if you are interested.

Good luck!!

,talhead,2008-06-16T20:29Z,"What I meant to say in the post above was that the website is free, they offer a solution to high fuel costs. Complete instructions and diagrams are less than $100.00 USD. 

There is a lot of information on their website that you can garner for free and is real handy when thinking of converting to Hydrogen supplemental fuel system.


Again, good luck!!"
,richard.boyd,2008-06-21T20:28Z,"Hyperi0n_Supreme is an idiot. Before you comment on a torrent the least you could do is make an attempt to view it. the author spends nearly 40 minutes explaining why people like YOU should ""bang your head against something hard, that way you will be helping everyone else"" shut the eff up"
,kerouac1,2008-06-26T23:21Z,"Has anyone else had trouble understanding these comments? Files wouldn't play. I downloaded the new Divx 6.8 codec and now the files play. Good luck. 

P.S. Stanley Meyers was a psuedo scientist. His theory of storing water in a car until you were ready to use it - splitting the water molecule into its base elements of hydrogen and oxygen just before using the hydrogen for fuel - was well-meaning in concept, but flawed. It took more energy to split water in a closed system than the energy gained from the hydrogen produced.

That said, hydrogen can be viably produced commercially and cleanly nine different ways! Projected costs? $4 per gal retail equivalent now, $1.50/gal as hydrogen production ramps up and becomes more available. The real problem? Can you say MONOPOLY? The oil companies are taking over alternative energy sources and dragging their feet. Write your Congressman."
,Icyman01,2009-05-13T18:53Z,"this guy is very book smart but fails to test his points. he uses false assumptions with regards to the HHO generator. I have multiple HHO generators. he spends 20 mins proving on paper that HHO generators in cars will not work but it does. I built mine for only $40. It looks home made too. 
the HHO or Brown's Gas as it's called, is only used to accelerate the flame spread during combustion, thereby getting more of the vaporized fuel to combust during the initial part of the power stroke.  The benefits of the addition of Hydrogen in an internal combustion engine, including a diesel engine have been well researched and documented.

he may not be part of the ""conspiracy"" but he is too smart for his own good. I'm sure if he rode in my car and could see for himself that I get 12mpg more with the HHO generator, he would still say, no no no, it's this or that or you had a tail wind, lol.  His numbers don't mean anything when right from the beginning his assumption is junk. and that is that 5-7% of btu's comes from the Hydrogen.

the fact is that not all of the gas burns in the initial combustion process and he doesn't even address that at all.

the reason cars get better fuel economy with HHO is because the HHO enables more of the fuel to be burned in the engine!!!  

why wouldn't we want to get every BTU out of a gallon of gasoline or any other fuel.

Sir, please don't be too proud to test the HHO for yourself. the facts will speak for themselves.

good day..."
