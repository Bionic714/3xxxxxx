,hfw,2006-08-24T18:01Z,"still 0,0%...
It's obvious that you have a problem seeding this. Do you get a connection but it does'nt start seeding - try BitTornado. Do you get a connection but still don't read 100% something is wrong with your searchway/upload... or are you experiencing worse trouble ?"
