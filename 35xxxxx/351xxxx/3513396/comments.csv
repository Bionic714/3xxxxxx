,Starks_27,2006-12-02T23:27Z,"Hello! Something is wrong with the torrent, i'm stuck on 96,5 % and can't finish the download although there are seeders with the complete file. What could   cause this?"

Thanks!"

,Drainland90,2011-08-20T13:03Z,anyone know why there is no sound?
,oo_500,2012-01-31T19:25Z,"For some reason the game always mutes the sound when you start it. So you have to hit F4 to access the options and turn it on again, every single time. 

There's also a windowed option that is greyed out for some reason. So 3D3Windower has to be used."
