,bessiboy,2006-08-23T02:57Z,thx mate
,bessiboy,2006-08-23T03:52Z,"I just tried this one out and WOW.. This is something u all should have in your collection. What makes this program so good is that it really ""solves"" all the problems it finds. My computer had 630 problems and then I'm already using registry mechanic and spyware doctor etc. You can do so much more. Like change the bootscreen on startup :).. Funny thing... (maybe put a scary picture and scare the shit out of my little brother when he turns on the computer) :)... You can also get GREAT information about every single detail on your computer. I dont know what to say.. U just have to try it out. Great Stuff! really. Hope they dont disable my account :P... Thanx again mate."

Thanks"
,mark1012,2006-11-30T12:29Z,All you have to do is put your own username and for company just put n/a but make sure you do the same username and company and serial in the kegen and the tuneup so they match!

,pursuant,2006-12-09T17:39Z,I used this for awhile and all seemed to work fine until this week when it said this was not a registered version and I needed to enter a reg code. I went through this 2 weeks ago. I went back to the keygen reentered the code and restarted and it gave me a message that this was a fake code and wouldn't run till I had a valid code. Anyone else run into this?
,Dirty Freestyla,2006-12-15T06:32Z,thats weird.. everyone seems to be having with the key on this one except for me!! i ve downloaded this 2 weeks ago and it still runs like a charm! =)
