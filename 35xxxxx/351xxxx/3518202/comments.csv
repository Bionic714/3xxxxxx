,legendary_goku,2006-09-02T00:43Z,Am i blind or not? I installed this and copied the 2 font files into my fs9 fonts folder and the aircraft doesn't appear in my list? i mean in the list of aircraft selection...
,4X-AXG,2006-09-02T01:01Z,it's under Boeing-PSS
,Bob_T,2006-09-02T01:02Z,"@monkeydoodle, what do you mean plans? It's still being worked on, but AFAIK won't be a FS9 product. I've heard it's going to be FSX only.


@legendary_goku, did you install it in to the correct directory? PSS for some reason didn't have the installer check your registry to see where FS is installed, and you have to manually browse to it.

If you're sure it's there, I don't know what to tell you, sorry. It's working fine here. I did have to copy the two fonts over twice to get them to work, but just made a short flight around SEA and everything worked fine."
,tsakonas,2006-09-02T01:02Z,"@legendary_goku  : aRE u sure? Do you see the Boeing-Pss category?

btw if anyone's FPS are bollocks, just remove the vcockpit sections of the panel.cfg, and the FPS will jump back to normal"
,rrodger99,2006-09-02T05:06Z,"Heh,

I would love to take credit for this but all I did was download it & bring it here.

The real thanks goes to 4X-AXG & Baabis for the original upload."
,emb110,2006-09-02T05:20Z,"Thanks rrodger99 
However PSS has updated the base installer that fixes alot of things, such as no nav data, fps problems. Any chance of getting this. "
,NullCharacter,2006-09-02T05:33Z,"Regarding FPS problems,

I've noticed that my FPS hover around 30 when loading the plane and staying in the 2D view. However, as soon as I look out the window, or switch to 3d view the FPS drops to near 10 when I go back to 2D view. 

To solve this I found that you can simply hit the Alt button to bring up the FS file menu and then just simply click back to the simulator, or press the right mouse button and left mouse button again. It causes a slight pause but somehow resets the FPS back to 30 for me.

Hope it helps."
,emb110,2006-09-02T05:35Z,I know that may solve the fps problem but the fmc has no nav data so its basically useless.
,NullCharacter,2006-09-02T06:00Z,"You can get the navdata here: www.navdata.at

Just download the 0608 AIRAC for the PSS and install it."
,FSSR.Keyno,2006-09-02T06:53Z,"Interesting..
Beta right?
Anyone have luck with lighting?
Still cant get rid of the Z in set up/keyboard. I use Z for change View,WASD for moving in VC and Walkthru.
Thanks for the up.

,pilot013,2006-09-02T07:03Z,"Wow this is terrible.....In 2D I can't get more than 6-7 frames, outside the aircraft - 4-5 frames. Terrible! Hope the fix or any kind of updates to come as soon as possbile unless to increase the framerates!"

,legendary_goku,2006-09-02T14:29Z,"Bob_T Actually when i ran the installer the shortcut directory was default pss and so on,the next screen you had to choose where the pss757 must be installed...The box was filled in correctly C:/Program files......

So i clicked continue....

I didn't see the aircraft in my list so i rebooted after i rebooted a window opened named ""program"" and there i could find the pss757 but in the wrong directory..I copied the files to the correct directory but once i loaded the pss757 some of the gauges didn't work...I copied the 2 fonts into my fs2004 fonts folder but i haven't tried it in the windows fonts folder..Maybe that should help me solving this issue?
