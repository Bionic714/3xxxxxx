Originally released in Japan in 1992 and reissued in the U.S. by Squealer in late 1998, Dispersion is an album to acquire only if you like your psychedelic rock and heavy metal with a lot of improvisation, jamming and blowing. If you love hearing Cream and Jimi Hendrix's Band of Gypsies stretch out on their live recordings, Dispersion would be an excellent purchase. As a rule, Cream would provide its share of radio-friendly singles ("White Room," among others) and save the extended blowing for the stage. But there's nothing radio friendly about "Sanctuary," "Outside Gentiles," "Eucharist" and other extended performances on this CD (which isn't as punk influenced as earlier efforts like 1986's High Rise II). Extended guitar solos are the rule for High Rise, and Munehiro Narita (whose blistering, metallic distortion and feedback recall Hendrix and Eric Clapton) is such a captivating guitarist that it's a joy to hear him stretch. Obviously, long solos aren't everyone's cup of tea; Dispersion is for listeners who are willing to sit down and hear improvising rockers do their thing. ~ Alex Henderson, All Music Guide
