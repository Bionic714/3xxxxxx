JavaScript Essential Training
with: Charles G. Hollins
JavaScript Essential Training is a movie based workshop for HTML developers who wish to move from 
static to interactive Web development. Although JavaScript is primarily used to execute programming 
logic within the Web browser, the language has now become the industry standard for client-side 
programming. Thus, developers can apply their skills to Macromedia Flash, Adobe Acrobat and a variety 
of applications which support the JavaScript language.
