,fuckemily,2006-08-22T02:06Z,"might help if you look over your torrents before you release them
there is no .cfg in this package"
,FFWD,2006-08-22T12:11Z,"@fuckemily

If you unrar the file there is one;)

@gasgiver, is it possible to add a mc360 splash logo in your next release?"
,pinny121,2006-08-22T14:52Z,thanks for the scripts update
,GasGiver4711,2006-08-22T19:15Z,"fuckemily: Hmm, when I look at the Release I see 6 files here - 4 .rar - 1 .sfv and 1 .nfo - and yes its included in the rars, too ;-)"
,GasGiver4711,2006-08-22T19:17Z,"fuckemily: Oh - might really help to read the comments before posting ;-) ... You meant the .cfg - for sure its included in the rarset - why should i put it outside the archive, too ?"
,Manzzon,2006-08-23T07:56Z,"No dont add any MC360 splash logo like in the TECH releases, I see no reason for that. :)"
,ZENDO,2006-08-26T10:35Z,"GasGiver why is this build everytime i go to programs scanning al my games? And why is the menu on the left gone with Emulators and Programs? 
"
,Manzzon,2006-08-27T09:22Z,ZENDO: You can add menu items on the left in the settings now. Its not there by default any longer for some reason.
