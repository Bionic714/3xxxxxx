,duder1,2006-08-25T00:51Z,Rexxx?  I know that torrent is there but it's seeders have abandoned it and as you noticed I did make the comment that this is a repost.  guess you can't read descriptions.
,Rexxxifon,2006-08-25T01:05Z,"guess you can't read as well, as 5 people are seeding it right now.  Yeah it's a repost, but we don't need a repost of something that's already posted."
,duder1,2006-08-25T02:22Z,seems funny that as soon as I started seeding this there was about 25-30 people downloading it from this repost.  I'm not gonna sit here and argue with you over nonsense such as the crap your bringing up.  Move on too some other site if all your going to do is bitch and complain about someone posting or reposting something in here.  Move along little kiddie. chow.
