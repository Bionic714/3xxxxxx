,freakinsweet,2007-02-10T01:51Z,"i love PINKPOP.

the best concerts are at a place you can drink and smoke without being screwed over by pigs or security, gotta love the relaxed dutch ways.

i hope this is a good copy, i'll post a comment when it's d/loaded.



REQUEST:

does anyone have a good copy of RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS LIVE AT PINKPOP 5 JUNE 2006.

i have a bad copy, it's video/audio is out of timing and it pauses and jumps, all in all it's not a great copy.

i really would like a good copy coz i was there and had one of the best times of my life, so if anyone has a good copy please upload it. Cheers"
,freakinsweet,2007-02-24T11:27Z,"this torrent suffers from almost constant hash check fails, very annoying to see the % of the d/l going backwards not forwards.

but i have finally got it.

picture quality is ok but pixelates from time to time.

sound is not bad at least the timing is correct.

if you don't mind your d/l % going up, down, up, down for a few weeks then go for it."
