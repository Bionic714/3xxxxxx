I tried Forced Start briefly but I don't really know what that's supposed to do.  I'm missing two tiny pieces.  Any suggestions?"

codecs to play virtually every video file you can
find. The program also reads unfinished 
downloads, thus will you be able to view the
movie exept from the last 3% of it.

Get the player with codecs here (download link)

Good luck"
