wrong (it works but it takes longer) im gonna say how to do it the fast way
ok start by downloading PowerISO
then when its downloaded u just right click on the gold disc in the corner and go to mount disc or hower it written and when u have pressed mount u just go to the place where you downloaded it and double click on the winrar file (if u dont have winrar it will just be a text ""Rome - complete"")and anyway after that the program comes up like when u put in a cd and ask's u if u wanna install it and that crappy stuff press install and wait untill its done when it is done u just double click on the file that u mounted and it will open up with either poweriso or winrar well anyway then u just go into the map crack (i think thats the name havent downloaded it yet) and simply drag out the crack to the file where u installed rome total war and replace it with the startup file done play, play and play online"
,Basse94,2008-01-07T21:34Z,this might looks out like it takes longer but it doesent it takes at maximum 10 mins(without counting the installation time)
,Basse94,2008-01-07T21:36Z,it takes at maximum 10 mins for me(without the installation time)
,Basse94,2008-01-08T16:11Z,"ive downloaded it now and u need winrar and change the file u downloaded do like this
1.press change name
2. write "".rar"" after the text
3.if u dont have a full version download a serial key (just search here)
4 extract and use with DAEMON Tools"

,ObamaTookMyTV,2008-12-14T04:41Z,"to every one who is new to torrents: first off, the files in torrents are usually ""zipped"" or made smaller. inorder to play the game you have to ""unzip"" them. You can do this with any number of programs: Winzip is probably the best, but confusing at first to use, my preferred program is poweriso. However, with poweriso you cannot add an image file (the game) larger than 300mb. to solve this problem get a serial from it, i get mine from www.serial.ws,. after unpacking them, you have sever options:
1. mount the game
2. burn it to disc.
with option one all you do is after unpacking the game, open up the files, and then click on the button ""mount.
with option two, you open up the program, make sure you have a blank disc in your drive, then click burn.
*note* if the game has a crack with it, be sure to copy it into your installation directory before you burn it. 
Now you install the game. if you burned the disc, just take the disc out, re-insert it and it should automatically start install, if not open the disc up manually and find auto-play or some sort of installation application.
If you mounted it, do the same thing above, just with out the disc step.
Now, after installation, you need to copy the crack from the games folders, which you can access my merely opening up your torrent program of choice and selecting open containing folder and locate the crack. COPY everything in crack folder, and paste it into your installation directory. You access your installation directory by going: 
1. computer
2. program files
3. find game file (in this case sega)
4. paste into file
After pasting the crack, walaa you are done and ready to play the game. if you have more questions, or need more details, google it, its how most of us did it. 
Hopes this helps to all you newbies out there! :-)"
