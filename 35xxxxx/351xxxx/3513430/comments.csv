,djrvn,2006-08-17T23:35Z,can someone tell me how can i upload a torrent.. ???
,riancurtis,2006-08-23T03:08Z,"happy to say this thing works perfectly. Just so you know. you need the second and third disc from installation to update. It works though. . . . . no more lagging problems or ""computer too slow"" problems for those of us with Macbooks and Macbook Pros. Works like a freaking charm."
,oevboev,2006-08-27T05:45Z,Downloaded program with no problems now I need disc 2 to continue - What should I do? Is it downloadable?
,adam666,2006-08-27T15:58Z,"you can use windowz version of cd2(orkester) and cd3(soundbank),  search tpb for reason 3 and youll find two reason 3 win torrents."
,mikeymontano,2006-09-17T20:03Z,"Hey, download and installation worked fine, I downloaded the other 2 soundbank cds off the windows torrent, burned them to disc, but now Reason won't recognize them when I run the program and I have to put them in. The cd is ejected. What am I fucking up?"
,kevin360,2006-09-19T21:20Z,Do I need to burn cd's? can't I just open with azureus?
,Brule Thesp,2006-09-28T02:07Z,"I have the Orkester and Factory cd's from Reason 3.0, will they do?"
,dbsoundcheck,2006-10-17T21:15Z,"Installing onto my macbook pro right now! Using the  orkester and factory soundbank cd's for windows worked great! adamm666, you the man! Works great!"
,adam666,2006-10-19T20:10Z,"you dont have to burn the orkester and soundbank cds, one you hace the iso's you can just mount them with toast titanium when reason asks for them"
,thebowmanater,2006-11-11T15:50Z,"Toast Titanium 7.0 won't mount the .iso disk images from the windows version of reason.

Neither will the mac os built in disk mount.

does anyone know how to mount it if you are running on the new intel macs?"
,cukesuke,2006-11-23T02:40Z,"I have a PPC iMac and using the built-in disc mount didn't work. However, I used Toast Titanium to mount the disc image and it did work. So, Mac users, just use Toast."
,channelthirteen,2006-11-28T09:59Z,"Alright.  Fairly new to torrents, new to macs.  Couldn't mount the second disk, the Factory sound bank, to complete the install.  I know that stupid questions tend to be ignored... but...

I would also like to say that I was using BbS's before this whole internet thing happened and I am very glad to see that the true spirit of how I learned about computers is still alive (meaning good old pirate boards... I am proud of you kids!)"
,youwelcome,2006-11-30T12:26Z,Hi there guys! I am new to this website and I am trying to download Reason 3.0.5 for my Intel Mac but I only get to save a download name and no software. Please help :) Tanks a bunch!
,channelthirteen,2006-12-01T07:54Z,"nevermind, I figured it out.  Hey youwelcome, do you have a torrent client like bitlord or something?  Maybe that is why you can't download anything but the filename, you sort of need that."

,hotlunch,2007-03-22T23:01Z,"Most of your answers can be found in wikipedia
search azureus, or torrents, ect."
,ZoRzEr,2007-04-09T16:34Z,"I just simply burned the ISO file Orkester to a CD using Toast 7 Titanium. When prompted by Reason I just popped the CD in and voila, it started loading."
,MisterSheik,2007-04-28T01:45Z,"1st off adam666 is the man!
It took me a week to figure out how to get this to work so I'm doing a write up for ""the rest"" of us, who are perhaps not as computer savvy as we would like to be:

2nd: everything posted on this list enables you to get the program running.  Here's h
how I did it in a nutshell:

Download this torrent.
Download the two other reason CD's entitled rs-pr3b and rs-pr3c.

Download Toast the toast titanium torrent (search in the above search field on TPB) or open it in your mac.

Once toast is open, from this point onward you DO NOT need to burn any CD's. to brush up on what a CD image is and what iso 9660 means go here:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_9660

In toast in the left hand column there are 4 choices ""DATA, AUDIO, VIDEO, AND  COPY""

go to copy

under disc copy there are four choices ""DISC COPY, IMAGE FILE, BIN/CUE files, DISC IMAGE MERGE FILES""

go to the tab  entitled Image file 

Now on the right hand side of toast you will see two buttons ""SELECT, & MOUNT""

choose select.

this button will open up a finder window.

If you used Azereus (sp?) to download this torrent the file will be located under documents ->Azureus Downloads->""the torrent you downloaded for CD2 and CD3"" -> rs-pr3b (or c).

go to the folder for rs-pr3b and the file rs-pr3b.bin will be highlighted (note: we are still in toast here)

click on the file, and it should appear in the right hand side of the toast menu.

lastly press the button on the left called mount.

this should mount the disk ""image"" of the orkester bank, and you will see it as if it's actually there. in your cd drive.

You can do this for CD 3 as well, again , WITHOUT ever having to burn anything.

I hope this helps. feel free to contact me via this website for more information."
,moronthannot,2007-05-19T20:41Z,"ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL!!!!!
Oh, and by the way, thanks 5 million times MrSheik!!! I would never have gotten it to work without your ""to-do"" list.  Im in business! Thanks guys!"
,dillzaster,2007-06-13T07:47Z,"MisterSheik-

Ok, so i opened the file for the cd in Toast. i get a message saying ""Toast could not detect the format of ""rs-pr3b.bin"". Click continue if you are certain it is a valid disk image."".
so i click continue, and then i click mount.
here's my problem- the disk is mounted on my desktop, but it says its an Audio Disk and tries to open it in iTunes.  and when i try to install Reason and it tells me to put in the Orkester disk, nothing happens when i mount orkester.

help, please?"
,VariousBerries,2007-06-14T03:22Z,"Great step by step!    But where can I find those two other files???

""Download the two other reason CD's entitled rs-pr3b and rs-pr3c.""


Where do I find rs-pr3b and rs-pr3c ?????

"
,adam666,2007-06-28T20:40Z,"@VariousBerries: cds rs-pr3b and rs-pr3c can be found in the torrent i linked to earlier:
