This is one of my favorite albums ever. It's a South-African musical, sort of a mix of all the popular music styles of the era.

It was the first black South-African musical to ever reach an international audience, and did much for the anti-apartheid movement.

If anyone has any higher-quality rips of this, please let me know - I have so far not been able to find a CD version of this musical. Please rip it if you have it!

This was ripped from the LP Galaxy GAL 6001, using some mediocre equipment.

Ripped and edited with Audacity, encoded to FLAC using flac 1.1.2 on a Debian computer.
