if its the real program it a very good program 

so if someone could seed this many thanks"
,peeweesweden,2007-04-12T01:15Z,"This sort of works... you can install and crack it. However, you cannot connect to another one using the same crack, you get a ""license key conflict"", thank you very much. What good is this for then?"
,peeweesweden,2007-04-13T03:49Z,"Edit on my own comment:

On another torrent-site, this release is marked with the following note:

1) Unrar.
2) run the file: Fantasy Grounds Install.exe
3) run the file: Fantasy Grounds Patch Full Version- v1.05f
4) Then just copy the CrackIt.exe to the same directory as FantasyGrounds.exe and run it.

SERIAL NUMBER: Y4264-WV61F-XKR8E-KYW3Z-xxxx

PS = for the four xxxx enter random Capital Letters and / or Numbers.

And it seems to work! I got a campaign running on my stationary and my laptop here, working just fine. "

,KnThrak,2007-08-01T23:49Z,I wish someone would seed v2.0 of Fantasy Grounds :(
,jegol,2007-08-03T22:51Z,"Ok, I've moved the CrackIt to the same folder as the FantasyGrounds.exe, but whenever I try to run it, I need to enter a License key? What am I Missing? I've patched it with the patch it gave. "
,schaeffer2,2007-08-28T19:46Z,"dude you just type in whatever you want, 
(e.g. Jegol's Comp)
thats what i did."
,schaeffer2,2007-08-28T19:56Z,"i did everything right and checked the comments for help,
but it only lets me do the Tale of Dinor quest and only use the D20 system.
can someone help?"
,schaeffer2,2007-08-28T20:23Z,is it supposed to start out as D20 only? Do i make my own adventures? Will i get more quests later other than Tale of Dinor?
,hazardousindex,2007-09-22T04:19Z,"Does this crack not work with Windows Vista? It has been installed on several of my friends' computers and my own and worked fine (all running XP). But, when another friend followed the exact same instructions we did (twice), it wouldn't crack. Fantasy Grounds and the patch installed fine, but the crack file kept saying ""Error: cannot open file."" Any ideas on this one?"
,Sjavage,2007-09-29T19:25Z,hazardousindex: Try to copy the cracked exe (FantasyGrounds.exe) file from the XP machine to the Vista machine.
,hazardousindex,2007-09-30T06:43Z,"Oddly enough, it all worked when everything was installed on the DESKTOP in Vista. Whenever they tried installing Fantasy Grounds and the patch to a folder in the C drive and then cracking it, it wouldn't work. But they just installed FG and the patch to their desktop, then cracked it. I have no idea why this worked."
,Templestone,2008-01-31T13:27Z,"hazardousindex: Vista's new security system gives the Program Files directory a unique set of permissions which prevent other programs from altering the contents of files inside it. Basically, you can't overwrite a file (Mostly .exe and .dll, but there are several other protected extensions) that's inside your program files directory."
,Aelth,2008-05-16T00:57Z,Does anyone have Fantasy Grounds 2?
,Stitched,2008-06-08T16:34Z,"Has anyone tried just downloading the Installer for v2.0 and tried applying the crack ? 

According to the forums:

""FG2 looks for the FG1 license, if it finds it it won't ask you for it.""

So, it looks like if you have a ""valid"" license for FG1 installed the FG2 won't prompt you for it.

If that's the case, you should be able to make it work by installing this torrent and trying to install v2.0"
,ConraDargo,2008-06-17T18:29Z,"Doesn't seem to work that way, Stitched. I just now tried to download FG2 after having installed this cracked version, but what you get from FG's website isn't the full program but instead a download application for the full version - which asks for a license key the moment you run it...

And since you _don't_ have a key, just a crack, it won't work."
,krakenyi,2008-07-01T23:59Z,"Your time is worthless, absolutely worthless. Pretty damn cheap to use an outdated version to save, what, 30 bucks or so. Hahaha! "
,ConraDargo,2008-07-06T13:51Z,Actually it's 40 bucks for the GM and then another 24 for _each_ participating player - assuming that they'll settle for the Lite version.
,jegol,2008-08-19T10:42Z,"Satisfied with this torrent, but could we please get an update for 2.0?"
