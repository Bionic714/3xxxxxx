,912_na7,2011-11-06T19:43Z,"Can somebody please tell me what to do once i have the files downloaded? There is no ISO image, just a bunch of random files. What the hell do i do with those!"
,Mr_Jim,2011-12-13T21:04Z,"You have to unrar them, i would recommend winrar or 7-zip to ""un-pack"" them."
,jim.27,2012-01-22T10:14Z,i'v unpacked them but i only get a bin and a cue file but no iso. any help??
,Cleric21,2012-04-15T01:06Z,"Try mounting the .bin, then try mounting the .cue. Some Virtual Disk programs use the .bin, some need the .cue to tell them how to use the .bin. Didn't your mother ever tell you to try new things?

I'm getting an awful black scanline spam when I start the game up. I've put it into all sorts of compatibility modes, but every time I start the game up, it INSISTS on running speech recognition, which minimizes the game, and when I alt+tab in, the lines start. Leaving Speech running doesn't help, because it still minimizes and starts with the damn lines."
,rob701,2012-07-07T17:40Z,setup inx corrupted!!! help!!
