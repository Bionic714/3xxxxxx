Thank you very much for the video! I'm from Brazil and if it wasn't for people like you and Rosa Mannen I would never be able to see Amy's performances. And I'm a big fan so you have no idea how important those performances are for me!

The quality of the video is awesome and I'm glad that you included the introduction and the judges! I couldn't understand them but it doesn't matter because I got to see Amy!

Thanks again
