,parlyzone,2006-08-22T10:42Z,"This is the same copy as the others on the net, just encoded to DVDR... (3.7Gb!?) Why?

Sorry to say this but, you can get the exact same film in 700Mb -984 Mb in exact same quality...

Off course, if you don't know how to burn kvcd or other foramts to dvd, this torrent is just for you ;)

,master-beta,2006-08-24T02:31Z,"is there some problem with this torrent?, i've been trying to download for two days and am still on 0%"
,jeff mills,2006-08-26T21:38Z,"Very good Quality? Allow me to LOL!:)
Visual sucks, no colors. The less being said about ""the sound"", the better. 
My advice - wait for a better upload.

Cheers"
,pl1,2006-08-27T15:20Z,har nån passwordet till att öpna filen?

,Tiffany1,2006-09-01T13:14Z,"Please seed!!!  I´ve been stuck on 11,1% for several days now. :-("
,Primus1,2006-09-03T19:25Z,"I dont get it ?
Dvd-R should be a rip from a Dvd
not from any ather source 
Whats the point in doing Dvd-R from Vcd ? "
,naturespocket,2006-09-07T08:27Z,NTSC or PAL?
,zzzpanman,2006-09-13T01:37Z,"Quality is bad because it's a cam, so if you're after a DVDrip, I suggest you wait until it is released. No use whining here...
Be happy people bothers to put in the time to share with all of us what they have...
BTW, password for this rar file is: 'joining' (without the quotes)"
