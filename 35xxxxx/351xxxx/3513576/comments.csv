,amihaita,2006-08-22T06:54Z,"it seems is not working...
when starting the application cannot ""validate cd"""
,unstabil,2006-11-03T01:27Z,"Are you using Deamontools?
Try to mount your image on the first available drive letter, if it does not work, try another.
If THAT does not work, try to burn your image and stick it in your first drive."
,Dimma,2006-12-04T00:20Z,"Same problem as amihaita. Can't get it to work.
Does it work for anyone? Please help!"

,kinger251285,2007-08-02T16:07Z,"Burnt images onto cds of disc 1, 2 and 3 using nero smart centre. 1st disc ran fine opening and running the application. Entered the further cds and would not validate these, what is going wrong? can someone please help!"
,unstabil,2007-12-03T00:15Z,"Install, run the app from your C: -drive.
In a lot of cases, the image needs to be mounted at the first optical drive letter.

Ie, if your cd-rom is e:\, switch it to g:\ or whatever, then switch the ISO-image to be e:\.
Works for me, and a lot of other people.

Thanks to the uploader!"
