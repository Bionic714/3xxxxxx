Home to some of the world's most revered DJs and a thriving electronica scene, Europe is the source for the lastest trends in chill-out and down tempo music. We've traveled to France, Italy, Spain and beyond to seek out some of today's most progressive sounds. Euro Lounge is the perfect album for parties, clubs, cafes, or just enjoying while chilling out at home.
