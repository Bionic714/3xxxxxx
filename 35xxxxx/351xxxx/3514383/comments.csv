,Moogly3090,2008-01-13T04:37Z,"would be great if someone seeded I will seed for like a month, I always do... but damn will it kill you to give out 10kbps? or something low? remember, whoever seeds just adds to the speed of the download so if you all seed at least 5kbps with like 10 people seeding I could download it in like 1 hour or so thats not so bad... but damn fucking seed, anyways if you can't tell that Lil Eazy E implies that its his son you're a fucking retard. R.I.P. Eazy E"
