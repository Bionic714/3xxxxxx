,Carbamide,2006-08-23T06:34Z,"I'm just wondering; am I the only one that's *super* unimpressed by Captain Sim's efforts with this 757?  I mean, obviously the ""block"" system doesn't work when releasing aircraft, but it just seems like they did a hell of a lot better job on the 707 and 727."
,razorseal,2006-08-24T02:26Z,"i'm confused... why would I need the crack when I cant even get the updater/installer? lol
