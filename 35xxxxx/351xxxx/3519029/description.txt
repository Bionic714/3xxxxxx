Dutch Library book

Copied painstakingly 2006, AD.
JPG (Jpeg) format, High Resolution.Music in b/w and colorpictures of course in color, even more HiRes.
Be advised that the book was old and copying hard. I could not remove stickers since the book is still in use by the library in a city miles away.
The book also seemes to have been diminished in volume by the library, hence the incomplete frontpage. Music is intact and wonderfull, including all the stories by Poe.

Have fun, enjoy and spread freely.
From a musiclover for musiclovers.
