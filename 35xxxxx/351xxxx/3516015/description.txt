REVOLUTIONARY WEALTH: HOW IT WILL BE CREATED AND HOW IT WILL CHANGE OUR LIVES comes from the authors of FUTURE SHOCK and THE THIRD WAVE and examines how tomorrow's wealth will be created. It's not all about money and economics, however - it's also about educational opportunities and advantages, child-raising choices, and the work we do without pay for big companies. Moreover, it covers many connections between daily activities, form hobbies to habits, and wealth-producing non-money economic factors which economists might miss. Want to prepare for the real future? Don't just look at 'how to make money' books - consider the underlying social influences, as in REVOLUTIONARY WEALTH.
