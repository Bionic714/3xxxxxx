,MCFC OK,2006-08-19T23:35Z,"Doesn't work, needs a crack or a S/N"
,4X-AXG,2006-08-19T23:59Z,"rrodger99, since I read some people cannot get this to work, I think you have upload the installer only..that is not enough..I have posted the crack for this (made by -who-else- Wildmans)..it's on usenet as well..:)"
,rrodger99,2006-08-20T00:07Z,"I will have to go through the tons of unsorted files to see if I downloaded the crack.

I had no issues with the install but I didn't have the airplane installed prior.

Sorry it took a while to find...I have about 80gb of unsorted files I need to straighten out."
,Panodilo,2006-08-20T03:57Z,"lolol - what is this? No panel logic, no FMC? No pedestal? I can't throw the fuel cutoff switches on spool up. Seriously, CapSim have lost it. CapSim are fantastic exhibition items, but they offer no realism, nor the performance required to make such an addon work. Awful stats running this turkey. Maybe some camel jockeys can use it to practice crashing into Burj Al-Arab or some shit - lool."

,boeing777,2006-08-20T20:12Z,"The crack posted above works fine with this 1.2 release. 

Anyone else notice drop of fps with the new update vs. old ? Also it sucks that you can only use the flaps inside VC and not at all in 2D :-S

Maybe I just wait the LDS-757 and ditch this CS757 crap."
