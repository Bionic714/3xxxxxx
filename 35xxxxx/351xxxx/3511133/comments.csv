,scottieroot,2008-01-30T02:33Z,Thanks to those that seeded for me. It took me about three weeks but finally completed this beauty download. I will be seeding the shit out of this torrent for a few more days.  8.053 share ratio and counting

,DKqw,2008-07-19T08:15Z,"OK, so I finally got a 1TB hard drive, so I have somewhere to keep all my torrents. I'll be seeding now as much as I can."
,DKqw,2008-07-19T22:05Z,"So, this version of the DVD is sourced from a WMV and is not the most stellar picture quality. I've finally gotten the ASF version to transcode properly. As a result, I can now burn a higher quality version of the webcast. If anyone is interested in a somewhat higher quality version, let me know and I'll start a torrent. I can also do a DVD9 (DL) version if there's any interest.  

Please note, the ASF still contains the ""Now Playing: Oysterhead"" overlay and is still looks somewhat compressed because it's from the webcast."
