,Texaslambada,2006-08-14T21:16Z,Thank you!!! 
,Killer Joe,2006-08-14T21:21Z,"Speed is slow, but hang in there..."
,cykelskur,2006-08-14T21:23Z,only norwegian? not danish or swedish subs?
,Killer Joe,2006-08-14T22:01Z,"If you need subs for this movie, you don't get it anyway... Sorry..."
,olav66,2006-08-14T23:13Z,"But Killer Joe,

You have 2 large torrents going at the same time. That's ruin your bandwidth because you spread it too thin. It's been on for 2-3 hours and 0.7% is shared this far. By my calculus that'll mean some 300-500 hours(!!!). Hey, don't upload the 3rd one... it'll destroy the other two uppings..."
,olav66,2006-08-14T23:14Z,"Even better, remove one and leave only one running. Also, you seem to be firewalled..."
,Killer Joe,2006-08-15T00:06Z,I'm taking olav66's advice here and lowering the bandwith on the other Python until it's properly seeded. Thanks for the input olav66 !

You are serious, correct?

Killer Joe, thanks for this one for sure!"
,Killer Joe,2006-08-15T09:57Z,"Yes. Sorry about that. Only English and Norwegian subs. We are the the knights who say ""NIH""..."
,Killer Joe,2006-08-18T23:15Z,Finally we have 50 seeders. I'm signing off. Thanks for being patient with me !
