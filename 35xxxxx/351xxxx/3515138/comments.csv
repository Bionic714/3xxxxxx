,pidge,2006-08-23T16:47Z,"Not A fake. It's definitely Xmen3, and its good quality (don't no about insane though, after all, its a single disc divx).

Although there is an annoying logo in upper left corner."

,Tabs888,2006-08-24T10:10Z,"Good quality, but there is a KimSoft tag in top left. Worth the download."
,bluewer,2006-09-02T13:46Z,"Audio quality sucks
but
Video quality is good."
,weezl,2006-09-03T00:32Z,"Audio quality SUCKS ASS and sounds like CAM sound, also sometimes seems to be out of sync with video.
But video actually looks like a Divx3 dvd-rip.
