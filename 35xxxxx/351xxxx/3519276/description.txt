Football Factory star Danny Dyer is to host a new documentary series looking at the reality behind the movie.

The Real Football Factories will trace the history of football hooliganism from its roots in the 60s, holiday resort riots in the 70s and 80s through to the organised violence of the 90s and the present day.

The series, airing on Bravo early next year, will "replicate the style and imagery" of Nick Love's acclaimed movie through music, pop culture and news events of the time.

"As a big fan of The Football Factory I want to pay homage to Nick Love's film with The Real Football Factories and am delighted that Danny has agreed t be our front man," said Jonathan Webb, programming director at Bravo.

The show will begin with a one-hour special on England, with subsequent episodes focusing on different famous football fighting regions, including the North West (Man Utd and Liverpool), Yorkshire (Leeds and Sheffield), the Midlands (Villa and Birmingham), Scotland (Celtic and Rangers) and London (Chelsea, Millwall and West Ham).
