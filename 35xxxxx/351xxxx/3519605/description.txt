
This is the third chapter in Macaulay's great History of England
from the Accession of James II. In this chapter Macaulay looks 
at the state of the nation in 1685. He discusses the population, 
the revenue, the military system, the roads, the inns, the 
coaches, the great cities and, of course London, its coffee 
houses and first experiments in street lighting. An interesting 
diversion from Macaulays's usual obsession with politics but 
worry not, he still manages to crowbar some political intriguing
into this chapter.
