,odoinn,2006-08-24T11:45Z,I've been looking quite a while for such a torrent.  Thanks.
,fisk0,2006-08-26T00:42Z,"This torrent IS being seeded, it's just piratebay that  doesn't update the seeder list. At the moment there are 4 seeds."
,Osmooms,2006-09-21T10:55Z,"fisk0, thanks for share. I'm a fan of Adi Newton's work since I bought Advantage as an LP many years ago.
I have ""Thirst"" on a CD which I bought, and also ""Collective"".
If you're interested I can upload for you, however due to computer time restrictions a torrent would not be the way to go.
Leave message here 
Cheers
Osmooms"
,fisk0,2006-09-21T12:40Z,"Thanks Osmooms, I don't have Collective, but I just got the Thirst CD, Digital Soundtracks and a live recording from 1992 which I'll upload soon, I'm just waiting to see if possibly the Kinetic Engineering video album will finish anytime soon, so I can upload it all as a single torrent.

Do you have any other of Adi Newtons works, or perhaps any of the other Clock DVA-related bands (Like Visions of Excess, The Anti-Group/TAGC)?"
,Osmooms,2006-09-21T14:19Z,"I will upload Collective tomorrow (late here in Aussie land now) The only other work I have is an almost mint condition vinyl LP called ""The Last Testament . It was the final Fetish Records release and is a ""Best Of their artists. They include WKGB, The Bongos, Perry Haines, 8 Eyed Spy, Clock DVa, Genesis P-Orridge, Z'Ev, Stephen Mallinder, Bush Tetras, 23 Skidoo & Throbbing Gristle
Perhaps best if we contine by email Osmooms@zor.org"

I've been wayting so long for this"
,fisk0,2007-04-21T04:11Z,"Great to see that this is still seeded almost a year after I uploaded it.
I can not seed this at the moment, but I have got my hands on A LOT of Clock DVA and T.A.G.C. recently, and will make a torrent of it all as soon as it is all completed, properly tagged and checked for errors."
,fisk0,2007-08-05T01:06Z,"Well, I'm back after a lot of trouble after TPB restored an old backup where all my info was set to some incorrect stuff.

And since my last posting I've got A LOT of Clock DVA and their related bands (T.A.G.C., The Box, The Future, Visions of Excess - and that just a few of them!), which of course means I'll upload a HUGE - 2.90 GB - torrent of it all soon."
,Model 52b,2008-05-14T02:16Z,"This is great stuff ..

Anybody know of a digital version for torrent with thier awsome video installment called Kinetic Engeneering. A total classic - from the beyond of Amiga graphix. Let it come !"
