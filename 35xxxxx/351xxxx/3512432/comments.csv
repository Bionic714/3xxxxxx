,Philcore_The_Loud,2007-04-02T18:37Z,"Seed?! My torrent client says there's 0 seeds connected. I don't give a fuck what the statistics say if I'm still downloading at only 13 fucking kB/s... 19 hours is a loooong time. Please seed?! I promise I'll seed for at least 24 hours afterwards, probably cpl days even. Thanks. Btw, aXXo, you could fuck us all big time if you wanted :D Your name is the best proof of quality on tpb. I never even read the comments anymore, I just fly over the list of torrents til I find the movie I want with the ""-aXXo"" ending and I click download immediately. So if you wanted you could upload the worst virus ever and thousands of people would fall for it :D But I'm sure you would never do that. Thanks for all the great work! Take care"
,Demorgon,2007-04-16T03:49Z,"Just a tip if you want to view only aXXo torrent uploads us this link. http://thepiratebay.org/user/aXXo

Now you can see all of aXXo's new and past releases!"
,madhouserevival,2007-08-15T04:16Z,"I've downloaded movies fast even when Utorrent says there are ZERO seeds. So, yes, the stats are BS. I uploading a program. 2.5k  was the upload speed (even though I set is for 500). Anyway, the site said there were 4 seeds, when I hadn't even come close to finishing the upload."
,Harry Q Hammer,2008-04-06T11:32Z,"The stats are usually fairly accurate, however there is more to consider, such as the torrent's extant distributed hash table (DHT) and peer exchange (PEX).  As long as you use either uTorrent or Azureus and don't screw with the default DHT and PEX settings you will maximize your chances of getting the file, even if the tracker's stats say zero seeders.
