Noticed there were no torrents for any Bandits music, so... here's some.

Bandits of the Acoustic Revolution's only released EP, so far. I don't know who ripped it originally, but here it is in any case. Great music, completely unclassifiable by genre.

Contains: 
All 5 tracks from the EP in 192kbit.
Scans on all images from the original cover.

'Tis my first torrent, so bare with me if something b0rks up.
Enjoy.
