,Pajas1,2006-08-16T06:03Z,sensons 22 > What are you referring to?
,Hellraiser5,2006-08-17T09:44Z,"The Rar file is corrupted, i really dont understand why people go to all the trouble to make an errorsensitive rarfile instead of just putting the VOB files in the torrent?"
,eb#1,2006-08-17T12:46Z,The rar file is NOT corrupted. It unrared just fine. You are probably using an old version of winrar.
,Pajas1,2006-08-17T16:37Z,"IÂ´ve cheked the files before I upped it, and it worked just fine.  Try again."
,yobro62,2006-10-04T22:28Z,Seed please!
,rorschach1234,2006-12-05T19:47Z,"This torrent is stuck at 99.6% (very frustrating!) - please can the uploader seed just a bit more, so that the rest of us can complete the download and seed to others... THANK YOU!"
