The astonishing true story of Hitler's private secretary coming to terms with working alongside unspeakable evil after remaining silent for nearly sixty years.

In 1942, Traudl Junge was an apolitical 22-year-old chosen from a clerical pool to work as one of Adolf Hitler's private secretaries. Working day-in, day-out for Hitler, Junge viewed him as a surrogate father figure, private and polite, nothing like the crazed rhetorician of his speeches. Shielded from the knowledge of Hitler's acts of atrocity, convinced she was in the centre of information, she was actually in a blind spot. As the Nazi regime plunged further into madness, Junge witnessed everything up toithe final chaotic days in the bunker. 

Completed just months before Traudl Junge's death, 'Blind Spot: Hitler's Secretary' is a riveting personal history which demands to be seeniby all.
