Putumayo Records Presents:
Islands 1997
A relaxing world cruise, from Puerto Rico to Madagascar.  
Rip 320kbs
Covers Included.

It's a word that conjures up images of verdant, sunsplashed hideaways. Maui. Tahiti. Tortola. We think about escape, relaxation, and regeneration on palm-lined, white sandy beaches running into turquoise seas. Islands are stages for love, romance and passion. 
Since you can't always get to them, we're taking you on a sonic world cruise, from the more familiar Puerto Rico and Hawaii to the mysterious Cape Verde and Madagascar and ports in between. For what defines a land more than its music - full of local colors, rhythms and language? So sit back and relax, let the exotic sounds of foreign voices and instruments wash over you, and take a trip with "ISLANDS".
