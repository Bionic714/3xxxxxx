,Hosser,2006-08-19T19:11Z,I'd be cautious. Filesize seems VERY low for a program like SpinRite.
,xenomatrix,2006-08-19T22:13Z,"I tested the program on my PC, creation of a bootable floppy is OK, several scans indicate no virus or malware here...."
,blackleotard,2006-08-20T12:11Z,170KB is about right for the executable.
,naturespocket,2006-08-25T05:47Z,What's this for?
,SolSlyng,2006-08-25T06:11Z,SpinRite is for Technical Maintenance of HardDisc and Repair of Soft Faults - see www.grc.com
,djjester,2007-01-12T11:34Z,Filesize is very low because the writer writes all of his programs in assembly language
,Nightwalker05,2007-05-01T23:54Z,"This is a product to be bought. I shamefully regret I had a cracked version of this software, but I am BUYING this software because I have learnt what a brilliant man Steve Gibson (the creator) truly is (and that goes for his product too). Spinrite saves reputations and businesses, it deserves its fee and more. YOU CAN CHOOSE the right thing and purchase SpinRite here: http://www.grc.com/spinrite.htm

You can also listen to Steve Gibson's superb free security podcast here:

,Leffoo99,2008-10-14T12:55Z,Ok IÂ´ll buy it if it works!
,DogNo7,2009-08-08T23:49Z,"Steve Gibson is a complete git.

And as for his security podcast...

He understands less about computer security than the tiddledinks that wrote that piece of cow flop movie ""Hackers"".

This program is the only thing Steve Gibson has ever done that was worthwhile, once upon a time.

However, even this program was a ripoff of earlier work by Kolod research.

Don't buy this.  Just download it.

You'll feel better, and it is one of 1000 things you will never use."
,1560,2010-01-04T23:23Z,Nightwalker05 fuck off you goof
,Arecibo,2010-01-06T09:21Z,"1560, he ""fucked off"" almost three years ago, you fucking retard. Learn to check timestamps, n00b."
,TheMercO,2010-01-28T04:12Z,"Arecibo

LOL"
,MJKW2Ab,2010-09-07T01:43Z,"I do not have a dog in this fight over Steve Gibson. However I feel it's worth mentioning I recently seen him in a video interview in which he shows SpinRite and talks about how it works. He may not be a Bill Gates or Steve Jobs, but he did strike me as a man that has a real good understanding of hard drives and how they operate. So I figure with the hard drive job I currently have that SpinRite just might be able to extend the life of this hard drive a little while longer. "
