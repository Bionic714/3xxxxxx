Since you probably have the CD maybe you could re-rip it and make a new torrent, I would definitely seed. You could do WAV or FLAC or APE or atleast mp3 320kbps. I hate lossy music. I wont stand for it... degrading music to save space... please, why ruin a beautiful sound with distortion and low bitrate? Anyway, any word would be appreciated, thanks."
