,chuzzlewit,2008-03-22T03:39Z,This is an intensely frightening movie if you happen to believe in the UFO phenomenon.
,d00rkey,2008-08-23T10:25Z,"Thanks a lot!

I tried searching for the title and was really glad to find it here! I've only seen this movie once before and that was many years ago, but I remember it as a very good SF movie though.

There is no glowing fingers on these bastards, I recall. ;)"

,arthaxerxes,2010-10-05T17:54Z,Anyone had a problem playing this in their DVD Player in Region 1 (North America)?
,arthaxerxes,2010-10-05T18:55Z,"Source of this DVD is PAL so people in NTSC countries (North America, Japan, etc.) will probably be out of luck like me! :(

Unless people play this in their computer which usually plays both PAL and NTSC formats. "
