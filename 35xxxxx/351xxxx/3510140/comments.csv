Anybody knows how bypass it?

I have recently bought the CS 757 v1.1 blocks B C and E and I'd be more than willing to upload the installers becuase i've done my fair share of d/l'ing from this community.  If it is so that you should want to get ahold of these leave me a pm or comment in this torrent and I'll do my best."

also, all crackers please be ready for FS2Crew PMDG747

someone inform us please about the lvld 767 version...
how did you get the installer.. if it's working in your PC then you should send the .lic file which is  found in C:/WINDOWS/  
you will know which .lic   could be named like this 2c...and something like that"
,David-7237,2006-08-11T15:50Z,"hey FSDude... if you really bought this and installed it on your computer... then you would find the .lic flie in your C:/WINDOWS/
I'm sure that you ganna find it there
or search for .lic
you ganna see other .lic for other products but you need to get the 767 one... 
like the 737 defualt one is 2C733.lic
737pro one is 2C731.lic
I guess that 767 would be like 2C763.lic or soemthing like that

hope you reply"
,Panodilo,2006-08-12T01:08Z,lol - you got big cojones posting a file you bought in your name.

,David-7237,2006-08-14T15:18Z,"the file is OK..(the installer)
but it says when I start it (click on the clock)
