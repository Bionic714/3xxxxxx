David Arkenstone's music is usually found under a New age music section in music stores. Many of his pieces include a map and story in the CD case, almost all of them having a fantasy theme to them. The music itself is primarily instrumental in nature, with some vocalizations by Arkenstone and others. It has recently been described as "Cinematic New Age Rock" by some. He cites World Music, New Age, classical music, and rock music as his major influences.
