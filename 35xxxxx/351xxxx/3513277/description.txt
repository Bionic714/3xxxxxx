The most amazing album of the year. AMRC version is like 20MB smaller, so we bring for you retail, with pic's.

Agalloch?s third full length release called Ashes Against The Grain is a superb and eclectic collection which sports a myriad of different influences which will satisfy the needs of even the most demanding music lover. This enigmatic quartet which hails from the Pacific Northwest (Portland Oregon) play a unique style of music that blends all the best elements of Prog, black metal, doom and ambient soundscapes just to name a few.

Enjoy, this is really the best of the best.
