,olleulv,2006-08-23T01:00Z,shouldn't it be XII??
,pether,2006-08-23T20:36Z,"""shouldn't it be XII??""


Why would it?"
,gaila,2006-08-25T00:12Z,"Well...I got it down. But how do I use the files?
They're not rar or anything like that. Do I need a special program?"
,pether,2006-08-26T02:16Z,"They are ""rar"".
Just extract them like any other file and you will get a image that you can burn in whatever program of your choice."
,panteley,2006-08-26T09:03Z,"they are not 'rar',how to burn this game"
,pether,2006-08-26T20:32Z,".....

Extract the files and you get a image that you can burn. Why wont you listen?"
,panteley,2006-08-27T01:36Z,"i'm telling you,files are not extracting,they are something like .001 .002 .003 winRAR telling me add to archive etc. "
,pether,2006-08-27T14:36Z,Rightclick > Open with(?) > WinRar > Extract > Burn Image.
,Kackeroach,2006-08-28T11:14Z,"When the files are named .001 .002 and so on, you need to change the names. What you do is that you change the first sero to r... like .r01 .r02 and so on... easy isn't it :D"
,pether,2006-08-28T17:21Z,Or..... you just open them with winrar.
,panteley,2006-08-30T22:41Z,thx

,PhatSquirrel,2006-10-10T20:41Z,"First of all, there are 78 files,Â´which one should I extract or should I extract every single one of them?
second, even if I do so, theres shitloads of errors and saying the information is corrupted, I'm not used to extracting this way so if anybody could help out a bit and tell which file I should extract I'll appreciate it.
Thanks."

,dr.jaul,2008-03-24T22:24Z,how are people running this game? granted i am attempting to run it with an emulator which has hence resulted in epic failure. i have yet to find a way to run burnt game disks in my ps2. so again how is this torrent useful?
,psphackerowned,2008-07-18T06:06Z,"-for noobs- once you have fully downloaded this what you do is right click on the FIRST RAR folder and select the option ""extract here"", what thats going to do is take a part of the game from each RAR folder so all you have to do is extract the first folder, YOU DONT NEED TO EXTRACT THE OTHER FOLDERS JUST THE FIRST ONE"
,failure_xD,2008-11-05T17:04Z,bah... seeds?
,scorpionx55,2011-11-12T15:17Z,is it working after all this?
