Coffee has always had romantic resonance. Cowboys and vaqueros crouched by campfires on tiptoe, squinting into the smoke and cradling a tin cup of range brew. Humphrey Bogart's droopy eyes peering over a steaming cup of Java in Casablanca. Sensationalistic photos of beatniks in dark basements, dressed in black reading poetry, listening to jazz and sipping tiny cups of espresso. The smell of your grandma's kitchen on a Saturday morning, the air heavy with the smell of bacon, pancakes and coffee. 
Coffee has always been there in the background, like a dark liquid melody, perfuming the air with the scent of lands far away and unlimited possibilities. So sit back, enjoy the music, and sip away.
