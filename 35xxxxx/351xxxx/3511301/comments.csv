kinda scary to think about if you watch regular tv you're giving about 1/4 of your live to marketers"

,claudez,2008-01-24T20:33Z,"there is a problem with this video. on a standalone player it only shows the first 2hrs 5 minutes. i tried to re-encode it but when i do it runs out of sync. it does so because the audio file is 2 hrs 59 minutes and the video is 2 hrs 53 minutes. :(

P.S. on the computer, it plays fine."
