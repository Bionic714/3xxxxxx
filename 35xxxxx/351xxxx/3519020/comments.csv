This ver posted here is not supported."
,ldemetriou,2006-09-03T21:38Z,Arneapekatt you'll have to wait till TomTom Navigator 6 come's out.
,Arneapekatt,2006-09-04T18:07Z,Thanks dude!!. Now i know what ver to wait for. Is it that they have not made one yet? or is there no cracked ver yet. Is there any other navigator (cracked) for the symbian v3?

,duggan,2006-10-07T14:45Z,ive got a 6600 but i cant get it to install tomtom 5 can someone help me plz
,arcadia,2006-10-25T22:18Z,"sorry to ask an only somewhat related question: where do I put the maps and the voices? I tried /maps and /voices on memory card, but tt keeps saying they're not there."
,dataheadache,2006-11-02T10:28Z,arcadia - you need to put the maps in the root folder of your memory card. It will work fine once you have done this.
,lordloon,2006-11-29T01:30Z,"Where do i get maps and voices from, bit dull you see anewbie"
,Kapietein,2007-04-28T17:35Z,yeah yeah nice

,tigrisimo,2008-09-26T13:50Z,"duggan its very easy, just copy or send the .sis file to your mobile fone (and then install it on the memory card instead the phone memory) and enjoy your fresh tomtom"
,tigrisimo,2008-09-26T13:54Z,"duggan just copy the .sis file to the mobile (or send it via bt) assuming oyu still have 6600 then install following instructions from phone, now install to the memory card instead the phone internal memory and thats it"
