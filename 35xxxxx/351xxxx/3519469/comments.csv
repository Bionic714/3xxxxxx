,toppenkillen,2006-09-04T21:07Z,"Ok, so there will be no misstakes about it: This is the 64-bit version of Vista.

If you want the perhaps more ""normal"" 32-bit WinXP-followup then you should download this:

,hijoq,2006-09-04T21:58Z,"is the serial number included in the disc? otherwise, we need it! thanks"
,toppenkillen,2006-09-04T22:09Z,"Regarding serial:
Check the README.TXT file for info. For those already having a serial since pre-RC1 releases; use those if you want.

Another little thing:
The size given i the description (6,261.47 MB) is wrong so forget about that figure."
,Ior_2,2006-09-04T23:00Z,"Thanks, but read this:
""OK, there is one caveat. If you try to install an x64 version of Windows Vista, well, God help you. I have no idea what Microsoft was thinking with these products, but after getting over my initial euphoria at how good the hardware support was, I descended quite quickly into software compatibility hell. So unless I mention it explicitly, all the good news here applies solely to standard 32-bit (x86) Vista versions. The x64 stuff is still a nightmare. My guess is that it will always be a nightmare. So unless you have some specific workstation-type needs for more than 4 GB of RAM and very specific applications, please just skip out on x64 Vista versions entirely. There's no happy ending there and your sanity hangs in the balance.""

,toppenkillen,2006-09-04T23:16Z,"Well, Ior_2, that's pretty much *exactly* why I gave the heads-up in the 1st comment of this thread.."
,Ior_2,2006-09-05T00:12Z,"@ toppenkillen
I know.
I just think we can't give too many warnings :)"
,gomzi,2006-09-05T06:48Z,"thankyou Ior and toppen for the warning, i also heard that visa by itself is crappy....i mean OMG a 4GB sized OS, wht have they filled in it???? nuclear warheads."
,skowfritt,2006-09-05T06:58Z,They`ve weighted it down with MCE. Why? Somebody tell me.
,az5,2006-09-05T09:13Z,"I wonder if he did a serious test with Vista x64, he says he used it one day.

Straneg that Winrar wouldnt work since winrar has a shell extension that works perfectly in XP x64.

He seem to be continuing the compatibility myths about 64bit, ""nothign works"" while in fact you just have to use some brain and download the correct stuff instead of the wrong stuff.

However, I would agree VISTA x64 has more bugs than the 32 bit right now but Paul Turrot seem to want to throw out all 64 bit versions of Windows which is just ridicolous and shows that he doesnt know squat.
