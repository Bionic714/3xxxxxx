,FTP1,2006-08-13T16:07Z,"How is this supposed to wrok exactly? I've extracted and burnt to CD but it won't boot on power up. I've no problem with other boot disks but all the Hiren's I have tried to date have never booted. And when I access it through Windows Explorer, I can't find a program that launches any GUI. So I have no idea how to run any of the progrms the NFO lists. Any help please?"
,insert1821,2006-08-26T21:11Z,"to FTP1
It is because the mohterboard driver you are using not supported by the linux bootsystem that Hirens is made for...."
,FTP1,2006-09-01T07:48Z,Uh oh. OK is there a fix for that? Do I try to upgrade the motherboard driver somehow or what? I have an Asustek P4S800.
