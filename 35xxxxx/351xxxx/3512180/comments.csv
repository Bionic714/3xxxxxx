,ReVarre,2006-08-13T19:31Z,"Indeed it is, ignore TPB's saying that there is no seeders, I am seeding."
,ReVarre,2006-08-13T19:34Z,"THIS IS THE MP3 VERSION! Sorry for that.. It is NOT .WAV, and this is not 100% Quality either. 
I will put up an non compressed version for the finicky people, if asked (450Mb+)."
,joti666,2006-10-07T00:33Z,A non compressed version of this one would be more than nice...the covers would be a great bonus....Thanks 
,ReVarre,2006-11-24T15:54Z,Alright I'll upload and uncompressed one.. I'll let you know when it's up
