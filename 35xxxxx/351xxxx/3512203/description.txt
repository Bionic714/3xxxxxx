The debut solo effort from the Radiohead frontman, 'TheEraser' delivers elements of 'Kid A' and 'Amnesiac' as well as drawing from contemporaries such as Aphex Twin. Produced andarranged bylong-time Radiohead producer Nigel Godrich, 'The Eraser' gives Yorke the freedom to move further into the realms of electronica whilst retaining the melody-driven style of Radiohead.

Brilliant album, but very few torrents of it and any that are out there seem to have problems with the second track "Analyse", sometimes it's in a different format and it's missing the first few seconds, missing the intro of the song, kind of annoying, hence this torrent which doesn't have that missing part of the track. 

Please seed.
