,catchow58,2007-08-14T08:06Z,"HERE'S MY IMDB REVIEW!

I think my new favorite movie about Rock and Roll is also my favorite movie about religion! A quiet, dweebish librarian for the Mormon temple gets a chance to play with his old band, which happens to be one of the most important (and outrageous!) bands in rock and roll history. It's the chance he's dreamed of for thirty years, and his church friends help him get his bass guitar out of hock.

Years earlier, the excesses of the rock and roll lifestyle drove him mad, and nearly killed him, but this time Arthur ""Killer"" Kane stays humble, strives to be ""a good latter day saint"", leads the band in a backstage prayer, plays a triumphant set before ecstatic fans in London-- and then returns to his Mormon life, not knowing that he will be dead from leukemia in just a few months.

If it were written in a script, you'd find it too unbelievable, but it's all real, right down to the motherbeeping New York Dolls bowing their heads in prayer. I love how the incredible irony is never played up. No one telling the story feels the need to say how ironic this all is. Arthur Kane feels no conflict between his Mormon faith and his rock and roll. ""My job"", he says, ""is making people happy."" No one makes fun of Arthur. Both his Mormon friends and his Rock and Roll friends are interviewed, and they all have insights into his amazing story.

Back in the day, Arthur and lead singer David Johansen were feuding, but now, as grown-ups, the affection between the old friends is palpable. After the show, David says to Arthur: ""I love you so much! You make me so happy!"" Really, this is not so much a documentary as a feelgood-tearjerker scripted by Almighty God himself. And God turns out to be a Dolls fan.

If you want to know my opinion, I find the tenets of Mormon faith to be more that a little strange... but I was genuinely moved by the story of how Arthur Kane saved himself by finding a life of humility and service. And the band rocked!"
