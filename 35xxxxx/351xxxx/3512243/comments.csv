,KimiSA,2006-11-19T19:00Z,"i done everything like u guys said,, but my loader just keeps showing ERROR :-(

Someone plz help,, i dont wana play online ,, just need to get the crack working for offilne and lan.. "
,FordPL,2006-11-28T18:58Z,Sux. Showing error whatever i do! I renamed file rfactor.exe to rfactor.ex_ and it's still crashing! Damn it...
,scottevil,2006-11-29T01:22Z,"In rFactor folder, go to Tools/Folder options/View tab and uncheck ""Hide file extensions for known file types""

Now you'll be able to change the extension.

Rename the original rFactor.exe to rFactor.ex_

Don't overwrite it! It seems that the crack needs

the original (renamed) exe to work."
,scottevil,2006-11-29T19:50Z,"OK MY BAD.The info i put up is wrong
The crack zip has been built incorrectly and is one folder too deep.What you need to do is go in past the crack folder so you see the folders within the RAR=>CRACK=>  Loader GameData etc etc and extract those manuallly to the rfactor installation destination eg select gamedata the extract to C:\ProgramFiles\RFactor\.
If you just extract the main crack folder from the context menu you get a crack folder appear inside rfactors main loaction with the loader data etc etc inside that which wont be the right place for it.
An easy way is to extract the crack to a new location and remake a rar with the recently extracted folders needed ie the gamedata the lm3 file and the loader.Select them all right click and make a new rar then un pack that to the right folder,it then comes up with the overwrite confirmaton of the sound files within the gamedata folder.Dont rename the exe extension,run the loader and your good to go,pls be aware that good anti virus apps like Kaspersky wont allow the loader to run so you will need to diasble it on a temp basis or it will never load up for you.Paranoid? me too,i did a scan and the loader is clean of infection.I now have rfactor in complete form.THANKS TO SIMNOV for the upload :)

Sorry for the long winded explanation here."
,unknownspeedster,2006-12-02T01:36Z,can some explain to me what to do with the loader file and the .lma3 file i'm a bit of a noob at these things  
,leomax,2006-12-20T10:57Z,"^^ put both loader and .lma3 in the game folder ,that is Program Files\rFactor\ folder.
Then run the loader..."
,qwerty4030,2007-01-18T06:51Z,"ok i put all the files int he right places. and renamed rfactor.exe to rfactor.ex_ then ran the loader. this give me an ""Unexpected load error""
renaming the orginal exe back to rfactor.exe then running the loader also give me an error with weird characters :( HELP"

,edy1976k,2008-12-28T13:38Z,"Perfect!

Thanks simnov!
1-Extract crack folder and copy the files in to rFactor directory. Chose YES to replace the original files.

2-Run rFactor with rFactor.1.150.loader. (If first time not work run it again)

3-Enjoy!"
,TrialsPunk,2009-04-06T19:07Z,"DJ tony, your a prick. Not everyone speaks english, your just fucking ignorant. If you can't download and install a simple crack your a fucking retard."
