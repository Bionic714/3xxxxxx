The David Shayler and 7-7 Files (Audio+Video+Images+Archive)

On 28th July 2006 EX-MI5 agent David Shayler was prevented for good from disclosing information obtained in his employment. The British Attorney General won a final injunction against him at London's High Court to replace a 1997 interim order.

The judgment followed the conclusion of criminal proceedings, which began with Shayler's conviction under the Official Secrets Act in November 2002, for which he got six months. Shayler, ordered to pay costs after representing himself, was "likely to continue to make disclosures that could endanger lives" if he were not restrained, the court heard.

David was arrested on 1st August 1998 and held, without charge for nearly four months in a Paris Jail until his release. After his arrest, David's family and friends were denied permission to visit him for over sixty days. He is now forced to live in exile in France.

David's only crime is to have revealed ineptitude and malpractice within MI5, Britain's security service: shortcomings which have resulted in the waste of millions of pounds worth of taxpayers' money and, worse still, to the deaths of innocent civilians.

As Shayler has now been officially gagged... please find here a selection of his works and writing to date, along with some other 7-7 London bombing and UK related materials.
