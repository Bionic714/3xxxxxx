Because of the reason I have too low free space on the harddrive, I can only download 2 episodes at a time, but now I've donwloaded them all and so I write the comment here instead. =P
I just wanna thank you so damn much. I missed the first episode on TV, so I was like ""Oh well, wtf, I'll download it instead"".
Thanks man, they work great!""

So, djseph ey, Get the picture? This is all about my torrent. Dont brag on your torrent as if you did some great magical deed that no one yet did. Get off your lazy ass and search for it before you fuck up again. Oh and for all you visiting this torrent go to the ORIGINAL TORRENT here.

Thank you all and djseph rollover and well you know the expression. "

,brassman,2007-12-01T22:47Z,Fuck voldemortgod. This torrent is clean. voldemortgod's is a mess.
,_blank,2007-12-19T01:23Z,voldemortgod is quite the piece of work. there are more eloquent ways of letting an uploader know they have upped a dupe. 
,martinuz,2008-01-19T10:02Z,Cool.....
,PhishShticks,2008-02-14T17:58Z,is this uncensored or what?
,BloodLogic,2008-05-31T16:25Z,"If you're looking for crisp, clean, quality versions of seasons 1 and 2 of the Boondocks, then download this other torrent.
