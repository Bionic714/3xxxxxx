I Walked with a Zombie is a 1943 horror film directed by Jacques Tourneur.

This was the second horror film from producer Val Lewton for RKO Pictures (The first was the very successful Cat People). The film was edited by future film 
director Mark Robson, who would later direct his first film for producer Lewton.

As was typical of many of Lewton's horror films, he was given the film's title and, with the aid of credited writers, he created the story around the title.

I Walked was not a traditional zombie film, and was a box office success. It has since been acclaimed for its haunting atmosphere and nuanced performances.


Spoiler warning: Plot and/or ending details follow.

The plot is loosely suggestive of Jane Eyre.

A recently graduated nurse from Canada is hired to take care of a "mental case" living in a remote location on an island in the West Indies. The sick woman 
lives with her husband (Conway) and half-brother Wesley. Wesley secretly loved the woman. The husband thinks his wife has gone mad while the locals think she 
has been turned into a zombie. With the help of a local doctor, the nurse attempts to revive the woman from her trance like state. Nothing seems to work. 
Later, after hearing about a cure by a local witch doctor, the nurse takes the woman from the compound and walks her to the witch doctor.

The film's most memorable scene may be when the nurse guides the sick woman through the high sugar cane fields at night trying to find the voodoo 
practitioners. The only sound in the scene is the wind blowing and the distant drums.
