,Spoonto,2006-09-19T22:38Z,"Says 18 seeders, wonder why it's 0,1kb/s speed =\"

,pigdestroyer,2007-07-13T10:38Z,works for me. don't know about you guys but i got them both to work just fine. 
,cow_man,2007-10-14T00:02Z,Both work for me. Includes some screencaps in an asian language but the games themselves are english and work fine.
,pirotec,2007-11-20T06:26Z,"The games installed and worked properly but my mouse and keyboard scrolled way too fast on the maps on 1 and 2, also the coloration on 2 was really off... might just be system settings though"
,mrmagicstick,2007-12-27T18:16Z,"Can somebody help me install dont know how to do it

,Falleen_Fan_No_1,2008-02-01T16:51Z,"not working for me.  Sometimes i get audio, but not video.  It worked immediatly after finishing downloading, but this morning it won't load.  Can somebody tell me how to get it to work?  I really want to play this!"
,Falleen_Fan_No_1,2008-02-01T18:22Z,"use this torrent.  It's smaller and works.  I used DOSbox to get it to work.

,Compendium_Guy,2008-04-17T16:39Z,"War1 is the Orks & Humans game, War2 looks like the Expansion pack: Beyond the Dark Portal. You'll need to find the actual War2 game: Tides of Darkness, then use this as the expansion. Sorry guys, somebody screwed up here. Maybe the Battle Net Edition(BNE) has the original?"
,tzvu,2008-05-10T17:51Z,Yeah I can't figure out how to install this on dosbox there is copyright protection and the included manual doesn't seem to correspond to the copyright protection questions.
,Alleonn,2008-07-28T19:49Z,"Use DOXBox for normal scrolling and to play in DOXBox without occuring the no-cd problem type in:
Mount c: c:/warcraft (enter)
cd warcraft2 (enter)
changecd c:/warcraft/warcraft2/war2cd.bat (enter)
And you're done, I made an example for Warcraft 2 and in put it in c-drive within a folder called warcraft."
,devouringone3,2008-12-08T04:41Z,"Works fine... on XP directly ? Or do you absolutely need DOSbox ? Are there any other ways ?

""1. unrar
2. open war.exe or war2.exe
3. play	""

He never mentionned dosbox.. :/
Last time I tried that thing it did nothing but shit."
,devouringone3,2008-12-08T21:18Z,"Alright I played War2... Orc mission 1 and 2 worked perfectly... And I was able to reduce corner and key scrolling speed... there are no cinematics though :(.

I used DOSbox... :/"
,devouringone3,2008-12-08T21:19Z,"Oh yeah and this game is in english and features both Tides of Darkness and Beyond the Dark Portal... for playing on battle.net ..... mmmmm I don't think so, I won't even try it."
,BleedtheSky,2008-12-12T07:11Z,"21 seeders, 320kb/s. nice torrent."
,thatguykalem,2008-12-21T06:34Z,"Pretty good speed, but could be better.

Seed please!"
