,SpiralExit,2006-12-10T03:13Z,Half of episodes are NOT complete in my case... Can someone else confirm? 
,micleg,2007-03-21T20:44Z,Half of episodes? You mean 2984 people have downloaded this but noone else has mentioned it? Then I think I will take the risk and download it.
,tankdigfor,2007-03-29T08:56Z,"I am so sick of this! what am I doing wrong? 
Cause everytime I try to upload something here
it wont open! Is there something you have to unlock?"

,Logan X,2007-05-11T16:16Z,"does anyone else find that the special has the audio out of sync?
on the actual file before being burned to a dvd.
does anyone know how to fix this?
thanks"

,Saki33,2011-01-08T06:38Z,"Hey thanks eldianarda! You did a good job. I've only just watched s01e01 so far but excellent quality for that one.

I found subs for this at Subscene, the one that suits esselkuit. They are HI, but a quick job to remove them with Subtitle Edit 3.0. The others don't synch. If you aren't Brit you might need them. I was not catching all the words and my hearing is pret-ty good. 

Funny thing, you figure what are your chances this many years later? Damned good that's what! Plenty of seeders now and downloading very fast."
,DeepHole,2011-02-14T02:11Z,"Cause its Magic...
Better then Tv on Demand"
,clumsyshadow22,2012-08-01T02:12Z,"Brilliant show!
Hilarious!
Thanks for the upload!"
