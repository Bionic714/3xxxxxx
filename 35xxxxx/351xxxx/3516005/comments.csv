,Juhen,2006-11-09T17:13Z,I can't install it... I got daemon tools. Do I need any other program?
,darBis,2006-12-13T22:55Z,"2 Juhen: As I wrote in comments, you will need program called PowerISO to mount/burn this image. You can found it on TPB or buy it.
I decided to use it instead of packing it in archive, because u can use it without decompression and thus there is higher propability u keep original file on your hard drive for other leechers."

TPB means ThePirateBay
(but I'm sure, everyone knows)"
,Manas1,2007-01-16T17:00Z,"I downloaded this program, but i can't understand chezk language. So is there other languages in options? How can I change language?"
,darBis,2007-01-28T22:47Z,"ok, again, this is a Czech language version and there is NO OPTION to the change language. So you should download it ONLY if you speak CZECH.
If you don't speak Czech, find another torrent?"
