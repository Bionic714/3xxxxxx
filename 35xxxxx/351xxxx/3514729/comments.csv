,blackrave123,2007-01-02T15:29Z,"Yes, this file is working great."
,kristofferlh,2007-04-16T20:11Z,How did you open it?
,Rottweiler_,2007-04-19T17:55Z,Seed please :)
,srw985torrent,2007-07-15T20:11Z,"To open you need to burn to blank CD using Nero etc, or unzip it using winrar. Winrar is generally easier as it means no wasting CDs.

Both software you can get cracked / keygens for that work great on here."

Just download that and mount the ISO File. No need to waste your dvd/cdÂ´s."

,notARRRestedyet,2011-06-13T05:39Z,"Installs fine, but when you try to load anything to do with the expansion you get an error... looks like this one doesn't work. Anyone have a good copy? I can't find one anywhere."
