,seven8nine,2007-07-26T03:39Z,"1. show hidden files on your computer
2. rename your .rar file without torrent extension
3. expand your files
4. all files are not verified, but may be all complete.  
5. worked for me"
,seven8nine,2007-07-26T03:45Z,"quality is highly variable on this torrent, some files are for the most dedicated fans only. allman brothers band archival video may also be found on many fan sites, individually available with some review and audio quality ratings.  personally, much of this torrent i will dump because of quality standards.  happy returns for all, and thanks for seeding bootleg recordings."
,charliedawg,2007-07-30T13:39Z,"I have been at 99.8% for 2 days and have u/l almost 10 gigs.  Someone, PLEASE help a brother out and open your full seed."

,cyrano69,2008-10-26T22:09Z,Another one begging you to re-seed so we can finish off the download and then seed on your behalf.
,ummelman,2008-12-10T08:46Z,"I did as seven8nine recommended, and had success!  I simply set to show hidden files (done through the folders button in control panel), and then downloaded the trial version of bitzipper, which extracted my .rar file no problemo, and now I have some of my old Abb favorites, like that sweet 8/26/71 fm broadcast, and 29 more days on my bitzipper trial too!  Hell yeah, Happy Christmas to all!"
