,karekare,2006-08-14T12:39Z,"Thanks for the uploads :)
Too bad your disc 3 is broken, maybe it's time for the legendary petsel to step up to the plate ;)"
,pitufoburlon,2006-08-14T13:48Z,Thanks a lot !!!

,Son Of Mogh,2006-08-14T16:37Z,"Thnx again bender-c. Hope you had a good vacation too. 

I'm sure Petsel will at least *try* to help us out. It will be sort of a comeback as as a special guest. It will give us the chance to remember him and to thank him for the first 5 seasons. 

Long live all uploaders! And people who keep seeding after done downloading!"
,kvistarn,2007-07-30T12:22Z,does anyone have s6 disk3? It would be very nice if anyone could upload it...
,levdr,2008-01-06T14:09Z,"Would somebody please seed this? We're all stuck at 96,75 %. Please, somebody? Thanks so much."
,V4Friend,2008-01-10T08:20Z,"I would like to support levdr's request: could someone please seed S6D6 and S6D7 for a while, they are both stuck above 90% :-("
,V4Friend,2008-01-16T09:53Z,"OK, disc S6D7 was finally completed. Thanks for the hero who seeded the last piece. Could anyone please do the same for S6D6?

B.T.W. why do the stats say 1 seeder and 2 leeches? There really is NO seeder and there are about 20 waiting for the last 2.5%

???"
,V4Friend,2008-01-16T16:17Z,"No sweat, all_taken: we all make mistakes sometime (he who doesn't make mistakes, makes nothing?)

It would be really, really great if anyone could re-seed this torrent, cause many are waiting for the last bit. Maybe anyone can contact the original seeders? I've tried, but can't find any of them in the forum(s)."
,levdr,2008-01-17T01:45Z,"Weird, Transmission now says there's 1 seeder. I don't see him, no one is downloading, but it says Seeders: 1. The tension is killing me... :) "
,levdr,2008-01-17T11:50Z,"Wow, it's true, somebody is seeding now. This is SO GREAT! Thank you very much!!!"
,V4Friend,2008-01-17T19:05Z,I like to join your party: at last a seeder! Thanks! Please leave a message so we can thank you personally :-)
,V4Friend,2008-01-17T21:28Z,Sure hope that seeder comes back again :-(
,V4Friend,2008-01-21T14:27Z,"A small message for the two leechers that have (just a few pieces) more than the rest: Torrents only work if EVERYBODY uploads.

So be a sport and raise your upload rate!"
[T],wormman,2008-01-25T01:45Z,I found the disc and will help you seed.
,levdr,2008-01-25T03:42Z,"wormman, what luck you read the comments here. You are very kind to be helping us out like this. Thank you so very very much. "
