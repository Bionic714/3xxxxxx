,Fusebox2000,2009-02-02T09:17Z,"nma, you suggest that ""Modern day science and recent research indicate that it was humans evolving to cold weather that made them more innovative and less aggressive."" 

Weather averages are usually segmented by geographic areas, whilst I do think that what you suggested played a large part in the advancement of humans, it isn't as independent from Diamonds own theory as you imply."
,Minerva7101,2009-06-27T08:37Z,Great show! I also recommend reading the book which is much more in-depth than a TV documentary can ever be.
,cletussjy,2009-08-17T18:52Z,Thanks
,seraphserenade,2010-12-10T11:18Z,"wonderful documentary, even better book.
I highly recommend checking out the book ""A People's History of the World"" by Chris Harman - it builds on a lot of the insights of Jared Diamond while providing a much greater understanding of the role that class has had in shaping human society. Read both, Jared Diamond's first, Harman's book second, and I guarantee you'll walk away feeling not just that you know a bunch of historical facts, but that you're starting to understand 'how history works' maybe for the first time in your life."
