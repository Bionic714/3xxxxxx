1. all my shortcuts on my startmenu/quicklaunch has been edited.
2. gotten 2 folders. data\resources\ (hidden)
3. there is a .exe file (hidden) wich run the original .exe file.
4. wierd connections to port 13 and 80 from programs without icons and same name as applications that are running.

id say its a trojan there."
,manganh13,2006-09-07T14:22Z,"Please help, can´t get the game working. It keeps telling me to insert proper Darkstar DVD.
What do I do wrong?"
,The_Breadfan,2006-09-09T04:57Z,"There's no trojan or virus in this. My scanners would have picked it up and nothing had tried to call home at all or ZA would go scitz.

Just been wondering what region this is ie USA/Europe. I'm thinking that I should risk patching it because of graphical errors. So long as the patch doesn't replace the exe I should be fine, right?"

A bit of googlin taught me that this is because of a worm. Am currently doing a virus scan, hoping the problem can be fixed. The worst part is that the message now comes up when I start other games, even though they start after about 20 of these messages have appeared.

Wouldnt recommend this download if you dont have a good anti-virus. Wich I don't. :("

,ernescz,2010-01-01T02:39Z,"Thanks for the up! It works fine so far (4h into the game, no problems yet).
------
Here is what I did:
1. Install the game:
2. do NOT use reloded cracks
3. get the 1.3. update (just google it), english version is just 10mb. use it.
4. google for: DarkStar One v1.3 (v1.3.1416) [ENGLISH/RUSSIAN/GERMAN] No-DVD/Fixed EXE #2 26-06-2007, it's a 1.1 mb large rar,
5. extract the darkstarone.exe, AND WalPlugSpace.wex & WalPostFilter.wex to the install directory, overwrite existing ones.
6. enjoy!
---------
Hope this helps for anyone who still had some problems. No trojan or viruss found by ESET smart security.
Thanks for the up! The game is very similar to Freelancer but with modern graphics."
