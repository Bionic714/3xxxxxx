,saljumah,2010-01-21T13:38Z,Thanks! Great quality as always! :D
,rambambula,2011-04-14T10:06Z,If you play it with VLC you can delay subtitle both ways (+&-) with the 'h' and 'j' keys. You can also do the same with sound using 'f' and 'g' keys. As for codecs; google. You'll always find something.
,rambambula,2011-04-14T10:07Z,"...oh, I'm using a Mac so I don't know if the speed controls for VLC are the same for PC, but I would assume they are."
,rambambula,2011-04-14T10:10Z,"...and I just realized, maybe I should comment on the movie as well... It plays and sounds fine, nothing wrong with the quality. Great film for the family."
