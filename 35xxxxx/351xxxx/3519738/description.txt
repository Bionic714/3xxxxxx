A new language. Complicated...



Example (Non-sign): Llek. Wohoye?    Means: Hello. How are you?
Example (Sign): Ã–llek. Wohoye?    Means: Hello. How are you?

Also: If you don't like this language then please, don't flood the comments saying: "This is total crap" and "I hate this, don't download it", just delete it if you don't like it.
