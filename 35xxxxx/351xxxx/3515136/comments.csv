,speakeasy,2006-08-23T00:05Z,Nice up - thanks
,Holger Linström,2006-08-23T16:28Z,Why upload videos with ugly childfucker Michael Jackson???
,timelord,2006-08-27T19:24Z,"Cause even if he seems to be a prick, his music and videos are astounding. An artist and his work are different things.

Also, innocent until proven guilty, right?"
,kyrkbymannen,2006-09-22T08:33Z,Schysst upload! Kanon! (Great upload dude!)
,just me,2006-09-23T14:17Z,Outstanding work   :-)
,mackemacke,2006-10-11T12:51Z,nice dude
,karlmarx79,2007-02-06T04:36Z,Great Success! Very Nice!
,strokeny,2007-02-19T00:36Z,The only people that think that MJ is innocent are NAMBLA members. He's a freak and he should die pretty soon. No need to have him breathing my air.
,soggy_90,2007-02-20T08:27Z,"nice
foo fighters !!"
,Rex500,2007-03-20T05:46Z,Pls continue seeding!
,dboykin,2007-05-31T23:02Z,"Great upload and who cares about MJ? No matter what he does, doesn't change that his music/videos are works of art."
,Silver_Sickle,2007-06-26T20:50Z,Don't think about MJ. Think about the greatness of Queen. That's why your downloading.
,keesen,2007-07-19T23:51Z,"Otroligt dålig kvalitet.

Ser ut som nån filmat av sin TV med telefonen."
,Araaz,2007-07-24T20:43Z,Only FUcking ugly videos.............
,goingape,2007-07-27T06:13Z,"Don't get me wrong. I'm always happy when someone uploads a bunch of old classic videos. Thank you for that at least.  But two things to consider - #1 - most of us throw these videos into a playlist on random, and the last thing we want is for each of your videos to be prefaced by a really gaudy abuse of some 3D rendering program and home computer video editing featuring a 3D ""Skidvid"" logo in gold floating over a horrible aquamarine background complete with cheesy video transitions BEFORE EVERY SINGLE VIDEO! *sigh*

#2.  The video compression is awful.  And in this case, the source media is not entirely to blame because even the cheesy, unnecessary ""Skidvid"" intros have compression artifacts doing backflips and cartwheels across the screen."
,ornapster,2007-09-23T22:43Z,"Michael Jackson is not a freak neither a childfucker..
They accused him but he was proved to be innocent..
They made it because they wanted to take money from him but in the end they went to prison for lying to the police."
,olstruls6666,2007-10-28T12:07Z,"Ornapster has right! I dont like Michael Jackson neither, but there are people who can lie for money. And that´s what happened."
,demodin,2007-12-08T19:33Z,"okay?
and korn - freak on a leash?"
,dae.edorian,2007-12-17T07:39Z,"Nice collection, shame the quality isn't better...

Thanks just the same."
,jetcityjimi,2007-12-25T10:29Z,"@ornapster: NOT ""Proved Innocent"", only ""Not Guilty"". Big difference."
,Masta6,2008-02-16T11:05Z,Michael Jackson IS the freak
[T],towerelect,2008-02-17T16:49Z,"I find the quality of Skid Vid Video rips pretty poor, too much compression and they are no good at all for public performance on Hi Def flat screen TV's - So I source elsewhere.   If you look on Bit Torrent you will find ALL this lot on line many right off DVD and (added bonus) you do not have to spend time editing out the Ego Skid Vid Logo which really is truly awful... There I said it...  EGO... BIG SKID FLICK VIDEO EGO... Get a life dude...  Look at the John Lennon video collection I just put online and learn DUDE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
,theone_nr,2008-03-06T11:50Z,SkidVid i want to say that i have nothing with you or your work but the encoder in use for ur work SUCKS dude !!! Take a decent one like Tmpgencoder or CinemaCraftEncoder or even Nero Vision  !!!
,Saadi,2008-04-02T09:36Z,"Holger Linstr?m  you mother fucker Michael Jackson is not a Child Molester!!

,ANGAR,2008-05-01T12:59Z,F*CK this quality. Idiot!
,jakkop,2008-05-23T10:13Z,this was a really shitty collection of music vids. shame om you. =P
,DeepSpaceFreelancer,2008-06-23T22:04Z,Michael Jackson likes small children.
,grafikkort,2008-07-25T09:36Z,"even though much have been said about MJ he still has set a new kinda standard for music.

remember many of our socalled "" genious"" have some kinda screw loose somewhere :)"

,HerdFan39,2009-01-21T15:26Z,"Michael Jackson is not a freak? Wow, are you fucked. He's a fucking pedophile, boy-loving, no-pubes-having degenerate queer! I say that as someone who owns Off The Wall and Thriller. You know...when he was actually BLACK, and not a whitened, Diana Ross wannabe. 

And to the jackoff that said they (the fans) love his ""first 10 years"" of work? You mean when ol' man Joe was pimpin' out The 5, right, dickmeat?

I love the meatstick trying to justify the boy-fucker's alleged genius by spelling it ""genious""....now THAT is genius.

You MJ lovers are all so motherfucking delusional. Yeah...everyone out there has a goddamn agenda against the poor, lonely freak peter-puffer. Fuck YOU and fuck Michael Faggson. I bet my Roth and 401(k) you wouldn't allow your male children to spend the night at Neverland. If you would? As I said earlier, YOU ARE FUCKED.

Oh yeah...shitty fucking torrent. Mostly Oyster Bar tunes for fudge-packers.

Then again, that's just MY opinion. I could be wrong. (props, DM)"
,toodlefuckinoo,2009-02-08T01:42Z,"Might wanna double check those years. True Faith 1994? It was 1987. And Madonna's Vogue was 1990. Also missing quite a few of the ""most famous vids ever"""
