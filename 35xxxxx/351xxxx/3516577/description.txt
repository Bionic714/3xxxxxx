This wonderful CD is the 1st of the Adventure Cargo series. Produced and performed by Diane and David Arkenstone, the music of Adventure Cargo transports you to the land of Africa, beginning with African Skies. Throughout the album, you hear instruments such as marimbas, kalimbas, drums, flutes, and tribal voices. These beautiful musical instruments weaved and intertwined together to paint a rich portrait of the beautiful African landscapes. And while the music is wonderful, the album covers are also very attractive. The CD is packaged as a digipac with tri-fold covers. Inside, you will find some beautiful illustrated objects relating to Africa and a well-written descriptive note by Diane Arkenstone. These, along with the music, make this CD, a well-rounded album. And this great adventurous album is not one to be missed!
