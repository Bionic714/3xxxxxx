  The 4400 tells the stories of 4,400 people who disappeared 
  over a period of fifty years and they all reappear at the 
  exact same time without any memory of where they\'ve been 
  and what happened to them. Some of them have been altered 
  and have strange abilities, both good and bad.

  The series kicks off with a ball of light sailing toward 
  Earth, but rather than the expected catastrophic event, 
  thousands of people emerge from the ball of light. 
  They returnees have been missing from a few years to 
  several decades and no one has aged a day.

  Most critics have described the show as Close Encounters 
  Of The Third Kind meets X-Men but imho it is much more
  and much better.
