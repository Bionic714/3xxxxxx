Thanks for seeding this. I also can't get the file to mount and am unable to extract it. Any hints would be much appreciated, if someone has been successful with this.

,acezone,2006-09-08T15:59Z,"I cannot seem to open this dmg as well and I have no option in my ""right click"" menu."
,Creator_of_torrent,2006-09-12T01:20Z,"You have to finish downloading it before you can open it. The program you have, I have stuffit deluxe, will open the .dmg when it apears on the desktop, even if its not done. So just cancel the first time but CONTINUE to download it. When its done, open it normaly and it should work. "
,sgu,2006-09-17T17:57Z,"Does it work with macbook pro? Has anyone actually successfully installed this copy on their machines? If so, how did you do it? Thanks"
,Doodles23,2006-09-19T19:56Z,"Watch out for this one... 3 days after it was downloaded, Adobe found the IP address and sent Comcast an email. Comcast sent an email to the person who downloaded this particular torrent a cease and desist letter!"
[V],zofo,2006-09-23T10:03Z,This is complete bull. Mac OSX do not accept this file as a genuine .dmg file. Don't waste your time downloading this crap.
,Paddle,2006-10-10T23:33Z,Sorry guys this torrent don't work 10-10-06
,xXGogetaXx,2006-10-30T20:10Z,"""a cease and desist letter!""
Wow, that's like so much money... Wait, what?

Also, yeah. This torrent is bull crap. It doesn't open with stuff it. Same damn error."
,powerscape,2006-11-24T06:58Z,This DMG file is corrupted. I wasted my time by downloading this garbage. This image failed to mount because of not recognized from Mac OS 10.4.8. Nothing to do. Never download this.
,onedime,2009-12-30T11:23Z,A fake one.
,katiazev,2011-08-16T06:04Z,It doesn't work
