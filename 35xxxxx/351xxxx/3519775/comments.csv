,orgpunk,2006-09-06T15:59Z,"This movie is dubbed.
The most amusing part was that gayparty at the sheiks where they dressed up as dicks and danced in a circle around him."
,wankan,2006-09-17T22:02Z,Some people wouldn't recognise culture if it walked up and introduced itself .
,wankan,2007-02-28T21:20Z,"I'm fascinated . Which part of the description ""Texted language : English , spoken language is either Arabic, Turkish or Kurdish"" didn't you understand ?
Thanks for letting us know the spoken language is Turkish . I didn't know ."
