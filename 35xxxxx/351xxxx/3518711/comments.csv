,Crillie,2006-09-04T10:53Z,"This game sucked. And IÂ´m talking bout the gameplay. It feels like if you created ur own fps game in fps creator, and u would end up with something like this.

Yes I also googled for pics, and yes I also watched the trailers but damn this is aweful.

ITS SO AWFUL, SOMETIMES TO GET THE CROSSHAIR ON THE ENEMY YOU HAVE TO MOVE YOUR BODY, NOT ONLY THE MOUSE, BECAUSE THE STEERING SUCKS.

DONT DL for christ sake lol or be prepped to waste some space."
,lelle22,2006-09-04T19:16Z,"i DL another copy of this game and jeeeesus the game didn't even seem finished ,, the controls made me chew my keyboard into itsy bitsy pieces, and the framerate could be compared to watching a donut turn into mold, not so good ,, so my advice is ,, DON'T DOWNLOAD !!!"
