The World.
A lot of secret Russian military bases remained on the continents after the end of the \\\"Cold War\\\". They were waiting for the only command - to destroy the imperialistic enemy using nuclear power. However, as time passed, these bases became an economic and safety problem for new Russia. Latest news stating that a small Cuban base in Africa had been plundered by local inhabitants was also very disturbing. This base belonged to a network of the \\\"Spider System\\\", which was established by the Soviet Union. Local armed forces managed to get the stolen material back in a few days. However, nobody had a clue about the devil that sleeps in these small titanium cases. Message of the \\\"Cold War\\\". Atomic bombs.
A top secret programme \\\"Steel Fist\\\" was launched shortly after that. The aim of this programme was to remove the weapons and nuclear arsenal from the \\\"Spider System\\\". The 8?member crew of heavy cargo aircraft IL-76 Ruslan was aksed to carry out this mission.
\\\"We are on our way back home, the package is secure\\\" ? these were the last words of the aircraft captain. This aircraft never landed!
Situation.
A small specialized team, SPECNAZ, operated in Iran at that time. The team soon found out about the programme \\\"Steel Fist\\\". Its task was simple ? to return the \\\"package\\\" to its rightful owner.
