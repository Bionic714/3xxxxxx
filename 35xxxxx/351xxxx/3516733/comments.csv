,_-WoK-_,2006-08-28T16:18Z,"All of these episodes are Digital Satelite Rips (DSR) except E00 which is HDTV rip.

Huge thanks to ORENJi and SAiNTS scene groups who's provided this season of the 4400. Huge thanks to the leaks in the scene that made the episodes available for everyone.

Will it be a 4'th season? I don't know..."
,SoundWall,2006-08-30T10:08Z,"Thanks man!
I've got season 1 and 2 on DVD and have been waiting like mad for the third season.
And now I don't have to wait until I've bought the dvd to watch them!!

Thanks again!!"
,_-WoK-_,2006-08-30T11:49Z,"Good for you SoundWall, but remember that this torrent contains the episodes in XviD, so if you're going to watch them in a budget DVD player without XviD support, you have to convert them."
,LondonOntGuy,2006-09-02T03:37Z,"I assume they'll play good on a Philips DVP642 R1 no problem? 

Speaking of, if you play a video and it looks all fuckered up, hit the ""system menu"" button and it'll play normally. "

,Raggur,2006-10-08T19:54Z,what's with the download? it slower than my granma' crossing the street!!!!
,_-WoK-_,2006-10-09T16:08Z,"Raggur: I tried redownloading the torrent now to see if what you say is true, but for me it's not. After i got a piece, a lot of peers connected and the upload/download speeds were fine. 
It's just the thing that you need to get a complete piece first before the seeds/peers will start sharing for real, and that may take a while."
,Raggur,2006-10-09T20:04Z,"ok, thanks for answer.

and by the way: thanks for the torrent WOK. i've been looking forward to this for ages. love the 4400;D"
,_-WoK-_,2006-10-10T07:37Z,"You're welcome. I hope your speeds have gotten faster than granma' now. :)

By the way, There's going to be a 4'th season of The 4400."
,4365nokb6,2006-10-27T10:58Z,"thx for the quality up.  also thx for the split, i needn't the first couple.  thx."
,Lanix,2006-10-27T19:42Z,"I think I downloaded this before and deleted because of low quality.

Or isn't these the 4:3 and lowres rips?"
,_-WoK-_,2006-10-27T21:10Z,"These are 4:3 indeed, because the 4400 are originally aired in 4:3. 

Low quality? well, these are DSR, but they're not baad for being TV rips. 
HDTVrips or DVDrips are indeed better, but when this torrent was created there only existed DSR of the third season."
,_-WoK-_,2006-10-27T21:11Z,"BTW, the resolution is 512 x 384, which many 4:3 shows are released in by the scene."
,Lanix,2006-10-28T20:30Z,"Well, many channels pan & scan tv-shows/movies. OAR for ""The 4400"" is 16:9. I'll wait on a dvdrip."

,Rajje,2007-08-12T01:56Z,"The edges has been cut off on this release, the quality is low and ads show up in the corner now and then. The 4400 is filmed in 16:9 HDTV!

This release seems to be correct:
