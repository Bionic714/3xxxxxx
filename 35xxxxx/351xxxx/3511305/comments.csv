,janek2x,2006-08-19T14:03Z,That's lot of data :) I'm wondering how long I will be downloanding it...
,xlr8rpirate,2006-09-05T17:57Z,"ok, i just spent last 2 weeks downloading this, now what do you rename the ""worryingly"" small .PAR2 files to ? I tried renaming to .ts files but they dont play. The first 5 .ts files play ok (with chinese subs). hope some brainbox out there can assist. thanks in advance....."
,Necksnapper,2006-09-05T22:45Z,"this is not 1080p its ""only"" 1440x816"
,xlr8rpirate,2006-09-06T19:55Z,"ok, i got it to play smoothly using the suggested VLC Media Player software, but i still cant get any audio whatsoever from these files ?? All my other downloaded .ts movies play fine and with sound, except for this movie, anyone help ? thanks."
,xlr8rpirate,2006-09-07T13:41Z,"eureka!! sorted! Because I had changed the skin of the Player, i couldnt see the option to select the audio streams. Stream 1 is blank, stream 2 has English audio. Nice torrent now that i got it working. good job!"

,galt,2007-03-14T16:59Z,"A comment on the picture on this torrent. 

This is my first time writing and I would like to say to those who put up torrents that I am verr, verry greatful. I really admire your courage, skill and all the time you put down here. I cannot say enogh times how much I appreciate it, and I think I speak for a lot of people who don't nesseceraly (what difficult word to spell) write to share their satisfaction. The only sad thing is that people don't seed. I would suggest that you have to upload in order to download as a policy. 

What I really wanted to comment on was the picture. Has anybody else gotten a streched picture on this. It seems to me that the file is a litte compressed. I am not able to get a perfect balanced picture. I don't complain, but just raise a question as the new technology og hd is very new and there are a lot of things to discover. 

Again, thanx to alle the heroes out there"
