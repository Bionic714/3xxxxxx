,rrodger99,2006-08-15T06:23Z,"Ok A little bad news

The update to 1.1 won't run on this.

I am going to try make a rip of it but this is a learning process for me & it may take a bit."

,rrodger99,2006-08-15T06:30Z,"Just a reminder....

Thanks Huleo for posting the link above....but remember to just copy & paste it into your browser & not to click on it.

We dont want to bring attention to where we are coming from & direct links can provide that attention."
