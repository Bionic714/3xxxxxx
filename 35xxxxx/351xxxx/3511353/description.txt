Come Together - Guitar Tribute To The Beatles
Original Release Date: August 5, 1993 
Label: NYC (New York City)

Covers Included 

Thoughtful, sometimes moody, occasionally eerie collection of Beatles tunes released for the 30th anniversary of the Beatles hitting the pop music scene. Includes some terrific guitarists (many who don't get all the airtime they deserve) playing their favorite cuts. These are all very interesting arrangements with a few inspired riffs and others so lovingly executed that they have obviously been considered over a number of years. Great driving music for a rainy night. Not a single slouch track on the disk. A sleeper.
