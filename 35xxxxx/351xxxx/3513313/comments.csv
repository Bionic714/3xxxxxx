,onofus,2006-08-20T12:41Z,These things is really pissing me off. Why cant people seed so that others also can share the files?
,onofus,2006-08-20T12:50Z,I have been chasing this for months and every time im about to download it either nobody seeds or its a bad torrent. Anyone who has any hints on where to get the MUI for Thai? I already tried the LIP but that was no good since i dont want thai on every account.

,harigata,2009-01-20T20:44Z,"x32 means 32 language packs, I think : )

Does anyone know how to burn both iso images to the same disk?

'twould be a waste of a DVD to burn each separately....."
,n-talent,2009-08-12T04:34Z,"@harigata

I think james_eg1 meant 32 bit .... some people get confussed because they think if 64-bit is X64 then 32-bit has to be x32 ... but 32-bit is X86 instead. Am I right james_eg1? "
,n-talent,2009-08-12T04:38Z,"Sorry james_eg1... forgot to say thanx... 

Thank you...!!"
