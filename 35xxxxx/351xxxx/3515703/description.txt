The original flubber movie starring Fred MacMurray and the sequel:Son of Flubber

both in VCD format for a standard 80 min cd each

I had to upload these again as the other torrent disappeared and I was able to use a 

copy of The absent minded professor.  It's a DVD rip but the Son of flubber is from a 

VHS tape.  it's a fairly good copy though
