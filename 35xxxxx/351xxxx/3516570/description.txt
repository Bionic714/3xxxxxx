Hellsing Ultimate OVA Part 2


This is Episode 2 of the Hellsing Ultimate OVA series, where Jan and Luke Valentine invade Hellsing Manor. If you are a Hellsing fan, you have been waiting for this one since OVA 1 came out last march. 
This is in Japanese! There are no subtitles in any language! This is an early release, and no one has subtitled it yet! Get this file first, and then, if you know how, add the .ssa file when a sub group creates one. 
In the meantime, if you ever watched the Hellsing TV series' "Brotherhood" and "Dead Zone" episodes, or if you have read the Hellsing manga, you will know perfectly what is going on, and will have no problems. 
If you know nothing about Hellsing and just want to see some gorgeous gory anime, that's good too! But head to ATU-BOTI and read Hellsing Manga Volume 2 if you're confused. 
In the meantime here it is. This is a beautiful copy wiht strong color and I had no problems playing it. It is a great second episode, much much better than the first.
