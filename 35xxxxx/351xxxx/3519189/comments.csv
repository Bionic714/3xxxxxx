,kratman,2006-09-08T15:36Z,"The new album is bad, really really bad.
Been waiting for their new release since the day after rEVOLVEr came out and by the way that album was the greatest, so after they dropped the rEVOLVEr bomb, why the fuck would the release something like this?? No anger, No hate and no energy in the album, man they aint going to win any awards this year or the next. So it's rEVOLVEr thet will play through my days untill their next realese around 2009."
