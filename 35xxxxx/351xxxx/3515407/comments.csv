,bengel,2006-08-23T19:32Z,"That's *Enrique* Iglesias, you muppet. He is son of Julio who is well over 60 now.

Anyway, that clip is several years old and Enrique is doing lip-syncing without any clues to how his voice is sounding. Try it yourself: put on some headphones, crank up the volume and sing along while you're recording. Play it back.

Did you sound like Elvis or Enrique?"
,bengel,2006-08-23T19:49Z,"It's not that I'm a big fan of Iglesias or anything, but this story is 6 years old and it was settled when Enrique went into studio with Howard Stern to prove he could in fact sing. I've no idea why swedish television is using this bit without supplying the whole story.

Some background here: http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1430260/20000607/story.jhtml"
,bengel,2006-08-23T21:16Z,"That's exactly the point: he had no monitor. He's singing into the microphone, while the prerecorded track is played back over the sound system at high volumes. He can't hear what he shouts into the microphone, and thus has no cues available to correct himself.

But hey, be a fish if you want and believe all the false angles you're thrown. It's your loss not mine."

Tomorrow someone will give you ""irrefutable proof"" that Holocaust never happened or that there were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, and since you are the ridiculous tool that you are, you will believe them.

E. Iglesias has sold millions of records and held tons of live (no playbacks) shows. Of course he can sing. He sang directly in front of Howard Stern (do you even know who this is?), and Stern was satisfied that he know his stuff.

Here's a few more links, although you will never believe them, as you have in your hand ""irrefutable proof"" in the form of a video clip. Good game, man.

,Blixten_80,2006-09-08T17:36Z,"This was pretty funny!

And ""bengel"", it sounds like you know much about Enrique, for ""not"" being a fan... hmmm.
And if he ""Really"" could sing, he wouldn't put himself in that position. Everyone knows you can't sing very good if you don't hear yourself! Right?

Ps: Don't take everything so seriasly! You gotta LAUGH!!!"
