,Ethra,2006-09-07T03:24Z,"Hoppas du gillar den, mer 채r p책v채g... If you have requests, drop a comment, I have way more anime than I've currently got uploaded. If you're lucky I just may have it, or can get it ^^"
,technograph,2006-09-07T05:32Z,I can't get it with Japanese speech and English subs? I'm using Mplayer Classic. Are there subs included at all?
,Ethra,2006-09-08T19:45Z,"Naturally you can get it with english subs and Japanese speech. First of all, select the Japanese sound stream by opening the ""Play"" menu, and then select ""Audio"". There you find the two sound streams, called [Filename] /english and /japanese. Now you should have the Japanese Audio if you chose the Japanese sound stream. "
,Ethra,2006-09-08T19:50Z,"Now for the subs. Also under the ""Play"" menu, you'll find the section ""Filters"". Highlight that, and in the next menu that opens you'll hopefulyl find the DirectVobSub(Auto-loading version), or if you have any other subtitle filter, choose that. Highlight DirectVobSub(or your other subfilter), and make sure both ""Show subtitles"" and ""English(Embeded)"" are checked. That was the standard settings for me, don't know why it wasn't for you."
,Ethra,2007-01-14T06:04Z,"Thank you all for helping me seed this, I will not be seeding this torrent any longer. I hope someone can find it in their heart to take over this torrent and keep it well-seeded. But no torrent of mine will ever die, so if we suddenly run out of seeders, I will start seeding again by demand. Just send a message. I need space and bandwidth for new torrents =)"
,lee79,2007-01-21T15:02Z,"Could you please SEED a bit longer. I am very appreciate your help.

Thanks in advance."
,Ethra,2007-02-26T09:37Z,Seeding.
,Ethra,2007-05-12T18:51Z,"Seeding for a few weeks again, I hope at least some of you will help me seed this so I can focus on new releases."
,armand14,2007-07-15T01:22Z,Thank you Ethra. Great quality and you didn't have to but you did. Would you happen to have Vampire hunter D. Thanks again I will help seed as much as possible.

,AnimeLover,2007-07-16T17:21Z,"hehe thought this would be a newer anime ^^

i hate these Old Type of anime XD

So for those who like well drawn newer anime dont DL this :)"
,Ethra,2007-07-20T23:46Z,"it IS well drawn, but keep in mind that was 15 years ago. It's a nifty little series tho, and the fact that it's still popular efter 15 years speaks for itself =) 

I'm looking forward to your uploads tho, I could help seed =)"
