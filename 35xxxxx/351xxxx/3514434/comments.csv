,lelle22,2006-08-21T12:01Z,"So i just saw this film and yeah it DID sound interesting , but the film itself was actually nothing more then boooring, and the animations sucked ,, might be because the entire thing was made by just ONE guy, so in that aspect it's pretty impressive , but still, not enough for an entire movie ,,, a comicbook would be cool though.."
,orgpunk,2006-08-21T12:55Z,Worst movie ever!
,orgpunk,2006-08-21T12:56Z,The rip was ok though.

,ANicki_InTheUk,2008-01-20T01:33Z,"i rarely bother saying when a movie sucks, but this movie really sucks. terrible animation, no story, not worth bothering with, really."
,abomb1,2008-04-09T06:01Z,"if you like tweaker movies this is for you.  possibly one of the best movies ever made, but definitely a tweaker movie"
,Smoke.Lord,2008-08-27T00:36Z,"It's an really cool animation, try to make an own full length movie i flash^^"
,chaotix66,2010-08-17T07:34Z,"Great upload. As for the quality of the movie, this is one of those movies that you either get or you don't. Most people do and will fail to see the genius of this film. I'll admit, the first time I tried to watch, I only made it ten minutes in. When I did watch it all, that's when I saw what it really is. This movie is a masterpiece. Don't bash a movie just because you don't understand it. As for bashing me, feel free because I'll never be back to see your feeble attempts at trying to make yourself look big and bad over the internet. Most people on this site wouldn't know a good movie if they were beat to death with it. The ""Top 100"" here further proves that. "
