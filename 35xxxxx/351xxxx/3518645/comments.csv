,jagermeister,2006-09-03T00:34Z,"Btw, the difference from the other torrent(s) with the ""complete"" soundtrack, is that this REALLY is complete (both w and w/i DJ:s, ambience, police radio etc.), and has slightly higher quality."
,Nazca_,2006-09-06T21:06Z,"Cool,  nice share "
,aznvfgirl,2006-09-09T04:32Z,"This is a great seed, unfortunately all of it is in oggformat. Which is a pain if I want to put it on my mp3. I had to convert the tracks to mp3 format...ALL of them...."
,marvin12345,2006-10-02T21:23Z,"Great file :)
BTW, could you share your secrets of how to convert .ogg -> .mp3?"
,jagermeister,2006-10-08T18:37Z,"I use Batch processing in WaveLab (find it here on TPB). That way you can select all files, or all folders you want to convert and specify the output format to almost anything."
,jagermeister,2006-12-30T21:07Z,"Sorry for any inconvenience with the file formats. I will repost this one i MP3 format (nor RAR-ed) as soon as I get it myself again. My harddrive crashed and left me with no soundtrack at all... :( In fact, NOTHING at all... Oh well..."
,jagermeister,2007-01-01T17:25Z,"All the files are now converted to MP3, 192 Kbps, and 'll upload a torrent as soon as TPB gets their SQL errors out of the way... :("
,randall_ranks,2007-05-15T20:33Z,"I dont get it i downloaded it and all i got was the R.J's talking from all the stations but no Music.

BTW OGG format works in VLC Player. "
,gravy_t,2007-09-17T21:48Z,"thank you, j채germeister!

this upload is awsome! it really has everything! all the commercials, all of the talk station, everything!

i'm gonna keep seeding it for a while as much as i can. not day and night, but i will seed it for a couple of hours every day."
,skate666,2007-10-22T21:57Z,SEED PLZ!!! THANK YOU!
,skate666,2007-10-24T16:54Z,"I've downloaded san andreas wothput the cutscenes sounds and radio stations and i'm trying to put them back into the game with this file but i don't know how, help pls...thx"
,skate666,2007-10-24T18:49Z,How do I integrate it into the game?!thank you
,gravy_t,2007-11-23T19:13Z,"i don't understand your problem. the game already contains all this audio, why do you want to integrate it? these files are taken from the game and converted into ogg so you can listen to them any time you want.

if you want to add music to san andreas and listen to it as a radio station in-game, you'll need mp3 format files. read the game manual for instructions on where exactly to put the files."
,WiseNomad,2008-03-14T15:21Z,"How can I organize these files in my player to get smth like radio shows in game, Djs talk->music->Djs talk->Some commercials
Do I need to download some playlists?"

,Pr0gamE.,2008-07-18T14:44Z,Extract the file into Audio Streams
,_404,2008-07-25T21:10Z,"Great job. This is fantastic post. Just a suggestion but in the future if you just post the torrent as individual files or at the very least as individual station .rars you wouldn't need to post individual torrents. With uTorrent and I'm sure you can do this with others, you can select as little or as much of a torrent you want to download.

Also to those of you who are using MP3 players and needed to convert, try using Mediamonkey. You can use it to sync your player plus automatically convert the file to mp3 as it goes to the player."
,AkoHa,2008-08-07T14:45Z,where do u put the cut scene file i put it where Pr0gamE said it didn't work plz help
,jagermeister,2008-09-05T21:35Z,"Will be uploading this as MP3 ~192 Kbps in an hour or two. Note that this music already is in the game, this torrent can be used if you want to listen to it outside GTA:SA.

More good news: No more RAR files in the next upload... ;) I'll post a link here when I'm done."
,jagermeister,2008-09-05T23:32Z,Having some troubles with the upload page generating a 500 error... Have patience! :-)

,lightburst,2009-01-01T21:17Z,i've got all the folders with the ogg files in them in audio/stream. is this correct?
,musicskier,2009-01-03T20:18Z,"hey my download is downloading about 5kB/s

can someone help me make it faster?"
,musicskier,2009-01-05T22:17Z,"ok so i extracted the files from the cutscene and put them into the audio streams folder.

i also took out the original cutscene file and then ran the game. the game froze when it tried to play a cutscene
so i put the original cutscene file back into that folder, and there is still no sound...can someone help me?"
,musicskier,2009-01-06T01:43Z,"ok one more thing

i have no audio in the cutscenes so do i extract the cutscene rar file into audio streams or do i just put the cutscene rar file into audio streams?"
,LP_Man,2009-04-10T07:10Z,"How fuqqin' stoooopid can one get? No instructions. Not everyone here knows everything. A fuqqin' text file telling where shit goes would've been nice.

But noooooooooo."
,Bearface6,2009-06-10T07:58Z,"Musicskier, I'm having the same problem :/ let me know if you figure out what to do."
,djharehadzija,2009-10-07T20:27Z,N00bs put it in the audio folder for gods sake!
,-ZEEBEE-,2010-03-03T17:24Z,Thanks
,Unrestrained,2010-04-19T18:16Z,Where to put it? In your playlist.
,kshste,2010-05-16T23:11Z,Where to put it? The game already has these files u idiots!
,calavier,2010-06-26T08:44Z,"Hang on, everyone:
First of all, these files are the RIP of the GTA:SA compatible tracks. THESE FILES ARE NOT COMPATIBLE WITH GTA:SA. If your copy didn't come with the radio stations, I suggest finding a complete copy on tpb. if you do not know how to turn on your radio, press 'R' or 'Insert' to turn on radio, and change stations."
,colorado5a2,2011-01-28T16:47Z,"Compressed songs into a single RAR file?
That sucks... I enjoy the freedom to choose the files I want to download!"

,end0fdayz,2011-08-13T05:14Z,"Hey people, if you want to conver these Ogg files to mp3 or something else, get the free audio program at monkeysaudio.com.

I've been using that for years and it's not only good, but easy to use. Best of all, it's FREE.
====================================
Thanks to jagermeister for these songs!
~ GTA Fan 4 life!"
,STRYKER37,2012-02-19T06:41Z,"Thanks for the upload, this was excellent. Nice quick download. I'll be making sure to seed it for at least three weeks. My up speed is pretty average, but every bit helps I guess.

BTW: Does anyone know where I could get the beat that plays any time Tenpenny & Pulaski roll up? I've seen a few spliced and pieced together versions of it on YouTube, but I haven't been able to find the actual OGG file anywhere."
,xxranoshaxx,2012-03-29T23:41Z,gr8 really
