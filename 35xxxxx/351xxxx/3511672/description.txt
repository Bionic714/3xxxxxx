Abe, the strange Mudokon, is back with his powers to possess enemies and lead other Mudokons. This time he's joined by a Gabbit named Munch, an amphibious creature that can communicate with Fuzzles and shoot electric beams. They are definitely two of the weirdest characters in gaming, but they ooze personality, partially because of their design and mainly because of the outstanding voice acting provided by Lorne Lanning, president of Oddworld Inhabitants. Although the characters are cute, in a peculiar way, the game's dark humor gives them an edge.

Oddworld: Munch's Oddysee is primarily a puzzle game, with some action and adventure thrown in. The puzzles are great brainteasers that require players to use the special abilities of the two characters, know when to switch between them, and know when to guzzle performance-enhancing SoBe beverages. Several of the game's best puzzles get the player so caught up in their conventions that they overlook much simpler solutions.

This curious world seems totally believable through the power of Xbox. The mountains, water, caves, and factories in this foreign world are extremely detailed and lifelike. The in-game cutscenes are comparable to Pixar movies. Although the Oddworld games for the PlayStation had spot-on personality and gameplay, the Xbox has truly brought the developers' visions to life.

Oddworld Inhabitants has crafted a captivating experience that's imaginative, clever, and beautiful. Simply put, this is a must-have Xbox title.
