,kavabean,2007-12-08T14:21Z,"I am seeding. If you download please seed till ratio 2.0. This way this series will be propagated. People in the US need to get a better understanding that treatment, not prison is what is needed  for the drug problem. Seeing drug users as they are helps to see them as humans who need help... not prison. It's a medical problem."

,pukaface,2010-01-12T07:51Z,"I agree that the book is better and in hindsight this series doesn't compare to The Wire, but still a great watch and an awesome upload.  Thank you.  As previously mentioned this one is hard to find."

,alienguy,2011-10-05T08:10Z,"Hey spatcho, why would you comment that this is good quality? People like me see these sorts of comments and download it thinking it will be watchable. Why bother?? This is A-5 V-7 at best. Thank you for uploading jburnes as i havn't seen this before, but i will be deleting it afterwards as the quality is definitely not good enough to keep.. (P.S. I am not a blueray elitist asshole, i just like to be honest and save some people the bandwidth or time of downloading something they will be disappointed with as that is mostly what the comment section is for...)"
