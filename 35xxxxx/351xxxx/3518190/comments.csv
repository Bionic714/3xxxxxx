,Waldobaby,2006-09-11T05:44Z,"Not to worry. It is slow, but it is working. It just sits there in the list slowly getting to 100%, not bothering anyone, and worth every penny...
Thanks for the upload!"
,nefrit,2006-09-13T13:56Z,"I have just downloaded this ISO Image.
Its a DUTCH version. It has English Sound though, but subtitles can only be in DUTCH.
Apart from that its pretty good quality as one might expect for almost 5gb.
Seeding it for another week."
,ShAd0w_hUn7eR,2007-11-01T21:43Z,"hey wtf is it with ya people!?!?!??! what's the reason that u never write a full description for these DVDs! It wouldnt hurt to just say ""it has .......... subs, ............ 5.1 or dts audio, stripped or untouched menu and if there are extras on the DVD! THERE REALLY IS NO POINT IN UPLOADIN DVDS IF U DONT WRITE A DESCRIPTION!"
,metal_head81,2007-12-30T05:03Z,so does this include menus and extras or not??
