But I have one question.  You've posted all the songs except for Jacqueline and Evil and a Heathen.  Were you not able to get them, or were they not show, or something else?  It's just that I very much wanted Jacqueline.

Thank you so much!"

,smith_joe90,2006-09-03T01:12Z,Woah these are fantastic!! Do you have them in just audio format so i can put them on my ipod without taking lots of room with video. Thanks again!!
