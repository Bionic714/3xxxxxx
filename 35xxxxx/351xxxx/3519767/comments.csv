,kizzz2000,2008-05-01T15:35Z,"Ok now for all of those that cant figure it out I'm going to tell you step by step

Step 1: Download and install Demon tools (I did Demon tools lite) Download it at http://www.disc-tools.com/download/daemon

Step 2: Open demon tools you will see a icon on the bottom right hand corner of your computer where the time is... left click demon tools then chose  (Device 0:) navagate to the DANCE7D1 it should pop up with the install. 

Step 3: when it pops up to insert disk 2 Do the same as step 1 but navagate to DANCE7D2 and hit ok. when it is finished installing head to step 4

Step 4: mount DANCE7D1 again go to my computer then right click DANCE7D1 then exsplore. You will see a folder called CRACK open it Right click Copy. Find the eJay folder most likey in (C:\Program Files\eJay) in the ejay folder right click past and it will ask you to replace it say Yes then I suguest you right click the crack you just put in the folder and send to desktop so you can just double click it there. 

Step 5: Pat your self on the back you just did it. 

Ps. It does work on vista as well as xp good luck :D"

However, when I then launch the program, I get the following error: ""Unable to initialize the ASPI manager.

Any and all help will be muchly appreciated. =)"

In case others experience the problem, the solution is quite simple. All you need to do is run the program as an administrator. Once done, you'll need to close the 'WnAspiNT' program that opens up when you first launch it.

Hope that helps others with the same problems. =)"

,pappudj,2008-12-16T14:15Z,"""Unable to initialize ASPI manager"" ?
hello everyone, finally i figured it out.
the solution is for Windows Vista Ultimate..

1st. Install Dance Ejay 7 (install everything)

2nd. Crack it, use the crack exe file in Crack directory of Disk 1 (copy and paste to installed directory).

3rd and final (the most Imp. point) is. goto your system32 folder and delete the following file (WNASPINT.DLL). thats it.

now enjoy Dance Ejay the way you like..

Thanks.....

Oh! and if needed then download and install ""Force ASPI"" (http://www.radified.com/ASPI/forceaspi.htm) and update the ASPI drivers if it says so, ofcours in Administrator Mode"
,AngusBurgerus,2008-12-22T13:37Z,"I still have a problem...(I need desperate help)
When I run it normally it says ASPI not working etc but when I run it as administrator the box that says ejay appeared but then it just stopped so i went to task manager and shut off ASPI thing and then the whole thing just shut off so then I tried deleting WNASPINT.DLL and tried it all again but it just says cannot find ASPI needs to close.Anyone be able to help me?"
,Matthuffy,2008-12-23T18:27Z,"for all those that are having problems with WnAspiNT issues in either vista 32 or 64, do the following. It has worked fine for me after this.

1.Go to this URL: http://www.frogaspi.org/download.htm
2. download the renamed dll file to desktop.
*3. If you are using Vista 64 but, rename it again to wnaspiNT.dll.

4. place this in your system32 folder overwriting the one that is there (*for vista 64, place this in your SysWOW64).

5. start the program and all will work fine.

if it has not worked for 32bit users, then try also changing the dll to wnaspiNT.dll.

very simple and permanent fix."
,125212,2009-01-03T02:29Z,"Well, I know steveo3242391 has already posted an answer to this qestion, but it didn't work. I made multiple songs, which each time I wasn't able to save. I go to the file manager, click save, and eJay confirms that it's been saved. However, the song does not show up in any folder. I looked in te C: drive, and there was nothing. I looked in the eJay program files, and there was nothing. I even tried exporting the song, which didn't work any better. If anyone else had this problem and was able to fix it, please tell me how. Thanks in advance."
,125212,2009-01-03T02:35Z,I also did a full system search for any file with my song's title in it. It came up with nothing.
,125212,2009-01-07T00:26Z,wurks fine on xp though...
,GustavK,2009-01-13T03:49Z,"Don't worry folks. This torrent is packed with everything you need to run eJay smoothly.

-there's a good comment along the thread explaining how you turn the .iso files into readable data, with de Daemon software.

-The comment also details the crack procedure, how you open CD1 with Daemon and extract the cracked .exe, etc

-Finally, for those who cant save and are probably using Vista, there's  a way to fix this:

Solution: Rick click ""computer""->Properties->Advanced System Settings. Under the advanced tab click the properties button under performance. Then go to the Data Execution Prevention(DEP) tab then click the ""add"" button and locate the DanceEjay7.exe file and select it. then click apply/ok. Now run Ejay Dance 7

If it does't work, try to run the program as an Administrator - right click on program's icon (.exe) - choose Run as Administrator

If you do this last step, the program might appear hard to inicialize. You might want to use Ctrl+Alt+Delete to open Task Manager.

 Doing this, notice how three ejay windows appear on your bottom task bar. Try to close the WnAspiNT window and click on the other remaining two. The program should start normally and you're all set to record your music.

Make sure to have the compatibility box unchecked in the program's .exe properties(right click-properties)

There might be a way of avoiding this task manager, window closing procedure, but it is not of my knowledge . I appreciate if any of you overcomes this and posts an solution.

I got the first procedure from this post: http://forums.govteen.com/showthread.php?p=4430092

,JBenyon,2010-08-30T14:16Z,"Ok then, I have managed to get this to work on Windows 7 Ultimate 32-bit so hope this helps you all!

1. First of all download and install VMWare Player from their website (google it) it's a free download but you have to register first.

2. Download Windows XP Professional SP3 from here http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5199210/WINDOWS_XP_PRO_32-BIT_SP3_ISO_ACTIVATED_GENUINE only took me about 10 mins to download, lots of seeders

3. Open VMWare Player and click to add a new Virtual Machine using an iso.  Find where you saved the XP file and use that.

4. Go through the install procedure (NOTE: You will need to find a key off the internet, although it is already activated, this only works when you do a clean install rather than using VMWare Player).

5. Mount the Disc 1 iso using whatever program you want in Vista/7 and make a note of the drive letter your virtual disc is assigned

6. Open your VMWare Player and open XP up.  At the bottom of the Player, there should be an icon of a CD. Click on it, then click settings. In the box that opens up, change the drive letter to the letter of your virtual drive. Click OK out of that window and then disconnect and re-connect to the disc drive in Player (Click CD icon, disconnect, click CD icon, connect).

7. Install CD1 of Ejay 7 in XP and go through the setup until it tells you to insert CD2. In Vista/7 unmount CD1 and mount CD2 into same drive. Disconnect/reconnect the CD drive in Player as before and click OK on the message that told you to insert CD2 and complete the installation.

8. Remount CD1 in Vista/7 and disconnect/reconnect to the disc drive in Player and cancel the autorun setup that comes up.

9. Open My Computer in XP and right click on the Ejay 7 CD and click on Explore. Copy the .exe file out of the crack folder into the installation folder (default: C:/eJay/)

10. Run the program

This is how I did it after a couple of hours of messing around with it and it works for me, I leave the CD1 mounted and connected to VMWare Player, don't know if it will work without but I just leave it connected.  Also when installing XP through VMWare Player, I just used all of the default settings going through, and it works fine. Hope this helps you all!"
,JBenyon,2010-08-30T14:17Z,"Btw, I haven't tried running it on 64-bit so don't know if this will work for that but give it a try and post your results :)"
,Kiweed,2010-09-11T02:41Z,I am running Windows 7 64bit and everything is installed and cracked but when i launch the app my screen just goes black and nothing happens.... Please help me if someone has a solution. Thx!
,Azriel2.0,2010-09-12T10:49Z,"is there a crack included? i found an app version of a crack, but it dont seem to do anything. any help plz"
,Rastamanse,2010-09-23T18:22Z,"first rule! dont use AVG 9.0 Or other crappy shit they always block the cracks when they find it. 
other rule if you have mounting problems, unistall it and get a new one from piratebay PowerISO workd great even when ive heard every stupid comment of that dosnt work! Second Rule Use Only 1* CD on PowerISO then After You Unmount And Mount Secondary ISO file in this Ejay Dance 7. 
If their is any problem more then download somewhere else a Ejay Dance 7"
,Rastamanse,2010-09-23T18:24Z,JBenyon - or you could do a clean install for windows xp and use virutal pc to switch from win 7 and xp! then install from xp and play from there.. but you need atleast 400GB with good speed.
,b0ngh1t,2011-01-05T22:40Z,"if you can't get this to work on xp then you are a moron.  Stop bitching and pay attention to what some of the people on this site have been posting.  All the information you need to make this program work on xp is in this thread.  Try page four or five.  As for Vista I can't get that shit to save no matter what I do, so I said fuck it and installed it on my desktop with xp and it works like a fucking charm.  Nice Fucking Upload."

,o6o6,2011-04-13T15:39Z,"it works fine for me on windows 7

when you extract the files from iso 1 and 2
go to setup and right click - properties -compatibility. and mark the compatibility mode then chose windows xp service pack 2 , click ok efter this run as administrator.

when you install the whole thing and copy the crack . make sure to do the same thing with the  program shortcut. 

and it will work just fine with no black screen.

i hope this will help you.


thanks meet_ball"
,reechuk,2011-09-26T19:54Z,"works fine on windows 7
