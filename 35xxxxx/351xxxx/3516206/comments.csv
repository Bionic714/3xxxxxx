,AforAnonymous,2006-08-27T03:25Z,no.
,uraphake,2006-08-27T16:41Z,"Unwilling to give a description usually means the content is either gay or some other less-than-desireable nonsense.
Kiddies must play, I guess."
,AforAnonymous,2006-08-27T23:13Z,"well, actually, the content is gay.

what else did you expect of lesbian porn by sapphicerotic.com? to be straight?"
,uraphake,2006-08-28T21:16Z,"What, are we supposed to read your mind? This is ""Pirate Bay"" not ""Psychic Bay.""
Regardless, I will pass on your offering since it doesn't have an adequate description or screens.
Thanks anyway."
