,Roge,2006-09-06T14:00Z,"Im trying to transfer games into my xbox for the first time. But theres no IP in my xbox. Should i just type a random IP? Also what should i type in DNS, default getaway, subnetmast and the other things in network in settings?

Im useing Qwix 1.1. Can anyone help?"
,dman10000,2006-09-06T15:28Z,superb un rared  and burned the iso file with nero on 4 speed  and worked perfect thanks for upload
,R0ssc00,2006-09-06T19:28Z,i unbuldled the iso with magic iso and copied to my xbox and i come up with the disk is dirty or damaged
,Roge,2006-09-08T20:07Z,"nvm i found it in a guide. :) 

But now i have another problem. :P 4 out of 5 games dont work. One stops at 99% when i try to transfer it and one at 84%. The other two dont start at all. That cant just be bad luck, can it?"
,Absolutfalk,2006-09-09T01:54Z,"Got the same problem as R0ssc00, i can play the first training level, then when it comes to chapter 1 it says ""Theres a problem with the disc youre using, it may be dirty or damaged"" 

I have burnt it with dvd decrypter and i have also copied it to my xbox harddrive, but if i start it from my harddrive it wont event start, i get theres a problem directly. 

Any suggestions?"
