,Rooboo,2006-09-08T20:59Z,"Om man en gång har laddat ner från www.fraps.com 

Kan man inte då änvända sig av en regad ?"
,dirtygirl,2006-09-10T07:23Z,"Jag har laddat ner, installerat men jag kan inte öppna det?. Vad är felet? det blinkar till när jag trycker sen händer inget:("
,woicer,2006-09-11T21:11Z,"HJÄLP! Jag gjorde misstaget att installera en demo-version innan, och nu kan jag inte starta den här. Hur kan jag göra? Jag hittar ingen lösning!"
,MamboX,2006-09-17T13:01Z,"tack för denna, funkar kanon!"
,Swedishbanshee,2006-09-23T16:05Z,"Hello, to solve problem with this getting locked if you had Demo version installed. Just simply open Regeditor. (Click on start then Run then write regedit). In regeditor you press Ctrl+F and Write Fraps and press search, then delete the file you get marked then press F3 and delete and repeat until done."
,Tonze92,2006-09-23T19:20Z,"thanks swedishbanshee, working now 100% :o"
,woicer,2006-09-25T15:02Z,"Don't work for me. I have uninstall the trial-version, delete all fraps-things in the regediator, but i cant run the real-version....
whats the problem?"
,Jaaaag,2006-09-26T14:45Z,"same here?! not working even when i have done all the tings in regedit.
Skulle gärna ha en förklaring/lösning på svenska."
,xxxLesy,2006-10-07T11:31Z,"SOLUTION!!!!

For all of you that had the discomfort of Fraps not running because you installed the demo first, here is the solution. It's a long and complicated process but it works ;)

1. Download Regmon (its a free registry monitor) - http://www.sysinternals.com/Utilities/Regmon.html
2. Extract and run it
3. Run Fraps, click back on Regmon window and wait untill the sandclock on your cursor disappears then quickly press Ctrl+E to stop new entries being added to Regmon.
4. Now use search (Ctrl+F) and look for ""HKCR\CLSID"".
5. You will find a line like this ""HKCR\CLSID\{7D028A55-8EDE-2854-1EFE-4D6FAC5A7AB8}"" (note: the numbers will not be the same on your computer)
6. Select it and press Ctrl+J to jump to regedit.
7. Delete this folder (to be safe also run a search for those numbers in Regedit)
8. Now go back to Regmon and search for ""HKLM\Software\Licenses"".
9. Like before, select the entry and press Ctrl+J to find it in Regedit and delete all entries in the Licenses folder (you wont be able to delete ""(default)"" but thats ok).
10. Now everytime you wish to start Fraps you will have to open Regmon first or it wont work! (If you forget to do this you will have to go to Regedit (Start\Run\Regedit), then HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Licenses and delete the content of that folder again)

The only other way to make it work is to format your c:\ and make a clean install without the demo.

Enjoy ;)"
,themegaloser1,2006-10-07T13:30Z,"To get it work if you had the demo version earlier. 

Delete the following keys in HKLM\Software\Licenses

{07F9ECD69182A4E6B}
{K7C0DB872A3F777C0}
{I7F9ECD69182A4E6B}

You can use regedit for example to do this "

,allemann,2006-11-17T21:52Z,"To open a torrent, u have to download a Torrent program... i like µTorrent and BitTorrent the most...
using those, u add the .torrent file u downloaded, and let it download.
a good thing is to read the comments and describtion (spelling?), because it can be hard to know what to do after downloading..."
