This torrent is in response to the previous "The Rosetta Stone Western Languages" torrent.  The previous version had a problem with the the English US Level 2.  The .rar file was corrupted.  What I did was add a good English US level 2.rar file as well as added British English Levels 1 & 2 as well as Hebrew.  It should all fit on a DVD just like before. Besides the languages listed below it also contains "Application V2.0.8.1a.rar" so there's no need to go looking for the application and the languages.  You can get it all right here.
Here's a list of the languages included.  Enjoy
