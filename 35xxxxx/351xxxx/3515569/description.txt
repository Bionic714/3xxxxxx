About half a year ago, a friend and I started recording our conversations. While we may be retarted, we think these are pretty funny.

Going from serious topics, (rarely) to random song outbursts, there are likely 4 or 5 people on the net total that will laugh at these. Hope that those 4 or 5 have a good time. :P
