Recording from the Danish radio channel P2. Each Tuesday, the channel airs a one hour show featuring new and innovative electronic music. Unfortunately, due to copyright restrictions these shows aren't available as podcasts, unlike the rest of the shows on the station.

More info on the show, plus playlists, can be found at the address http://www.dr.dk/p2/radium (Danish). Even though the show is in Danish, I guess other people would enjoy it too, as it's mostly sweet, uncut music with a few words thrown in between the tracks.

This week features a live recording of the Turkish musician Dj Ipek, which played on the Public Service Festival in Copenhagen this summer.


I would love to get some response from people if they find this useful, then I'll try to keep a torrent ready each week!
