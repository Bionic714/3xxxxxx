,anaustralian,2006-08-25T11:10Z,"If I download this I will report all seeders to their ISP, you have been warned."
,El Jafar,2006-08-25T12:09Z,emmpe: How do you know it is infected? It should contain at least one trojan. How can you see if it is that trojan or another malicious trojan that infects the infectors computer?
,Havalito,2006-09-01T05:16Z,"LoL what a bunch of noobs, ofcourse the AV companies say it is a virus because Optix is known by them. And thay block it from your computer because they donĂ¤t want you to make more trojans to spread. 
And for my opinion I think optix sucks there are better ones :P"

,csb696,2007-02-22T22:59Z,"you bunch dumbarses, not saying it ant infected, but if you did want to use software like this u have to turn off your AV because the trojan builder is detected as a trojan it's self because it has parts of the code from the trojan surver inside it... if you really want this software go to www.evileeyesoftware.com then you know it ant infected... by the way this fill is suspicious, optix pro is under 2MB so his added something to it"
