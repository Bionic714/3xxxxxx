,geppino,2006-09-02T22:11Z,"After installation, when I try to run the program it keeps asking to ""insert the CDROM"". do you need a patch or something? "
[T],ulysses56,2006-09-02T22:53Z,"To Geppino.
all you have to do is or burn a cd or insert your iso file into your virtual cd drive program as Daemon. It´s easy."
[T],ulysses56,2006-09-02T23:02Z,"Or you can put all the series of the interactive primal to an dvd-rom, then install all the programs and it will run just fine using the dvd as a source."
,sefred,2006-09-03T04:33Z,"bring em on ill help u seed
these are great   thanx"
,geppino,2006-09-03T10:59Z,"Sorry to keep asking but...I still can't run the SW.
My actions are:
1) I mount the .img file with deamon tool,
2) install the SW
then (leaving the cd image mounted) when run, the sw keeps asking to ""insert the correct cdrom""

Looks like the cd image (which is a .img not an .iso) is not passing some test. A disk name perhaps?

can someone help?


P.S anyway thansk to the uploader, very cool app."
,puttiplatt,2006-09-03T18:13Z,Works perfect. Im using deamon 3.47. Thanks alot ulysses56.
,az5,2006-09-10T15:49Z,"Getting same issue, it asks for the ""correct cd"" no matter what you do."
,az5,2006-09-10T16:04Z,"Works fine using Daemon tools.

Apparently using Daemon tools is required, if burned to cd it doesn't work."
,toofan,2006-09-16T12:29Z,ok tnx ...
,mazdon,2006-09-17T18:05Z,"What a sad story.... hmmm
I can get some of these torrent to work... with a lot of trouble.... burning CD:s that doesent work, loading down diffrent programs that doesen´t work to crack this torrent...so sad, I really looked forward to get this torrents as I have a lot of friends that are nurses or working in that area.
But I can see that it will be far to complicated for them to manage this downloads.... so sad.... ;(

Anyway ulysses56, thanks for trying...best regards Maxthegun"
,joburocks,2006-12-29T13:11Z,"Seriously thanks for the up, but why not redo it to .iso format.  now I gotta go steal deamon tools rofl"
,feror2,2007-01-21T15:46Z,"I'm from Brazil and i liked Anatomy Primal 3D Interactive Series(thanks ulysses56), it helps me with my medicine studies. cds 2,3,4,5,8,9 worked with daemon tools 4.00 with safedisc emulation activacted but the 1(knee), 6(shoulder) and 7(hip) didn't because it's safedisc 1.45.011. Someone can help me get those cds working? Thanks."
,feror2,2007-01-21T16:31Z,"I found the solution:
download this crack:
http://www.bestsharing.com/files/F6ocK208343/anatomy3d.zip.html
after installation of anatomy 3d products extract the 2 files in \primal pictures\knee or other...
and rename the executable shoulder to the executable folder name
i tried it only with knee, shoulder and hips i don't know about the others...
Sorry my bad english...
Enjoy :-)

Special thanks to ulysses56"
,booca,2007-01-30T17:15Z,"I could not find that crack to download on that site . Please, can you send again. Thanks a lot!!!!"
,Dr. Reef,2007-03-27T11:48Z,"Anyone have the ""anatomy3d.zip"" from Dr. Fernando Rosa..?

Could those persons please seed it or upload it somewhere again?

Thansk to both ulysses56 and Dr. Fernando Rosa.."
,haroo,2007-05-20T12:54Z,"I too was having lots of trouble getting these programs to work, but i think i have found the solution.

For some reason, using daemon tools 4.08 only allowed me to run discs 2,3,4,5,8 and 9, but by installing the older version daemon tools 3.47 (this is available from the website), i was able to get the whole series working by mounting the .img/.iso file with safedisc emulation (missing files torrent is not neccessary). Hope this helps others having trouble.

also to those who dontt like the files taking up their hard drive (neither do i) just burn all the files onto one disc using nero express (so that the .iso/.img files remain as .iso/.img files) and run the programs through daemon tools directly off the disc. abit slower but saves space:)

A huge thanks to ulysses56 for these! I highly recommend these programs, they have helped me hugely with my studies as a med student"
,Melguinha,2007-11-18T03:32Z,How to make this software work on Windows Vista?
,MeInClover,2007-12-08T16:17Z,"PrimalAnatomy was unable to find the Hip-CD.
How I solved this problem?
I mounted .CCD file (not .IMG file) with UltraIso 8.6. When Primal run for the first time, asked for folder with appsetup.txt. I pointed to the folder shared. That´s it.
You can get UltraIso here:
rapidshare(dot)com/files/5139533/uiso8601936.rar.html"
,MeInClover,2007-12-09T01:14Z,"forget about UltraISO.
as haroo said, use Daemon Tools 3.47.
configure to Emulation: Safedisc.
Mount img file"
