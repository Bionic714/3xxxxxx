,Elwood27,2008-12-17T06:34Z,"Anybody know where I can learn how to use those srt files? Or what program I need to use?

I wonder if this easier to find in Finland than America. I haven't seen it anywhere in the U.S. 

Thank you bob-ic!!! "

I especially remember the scene when the manager sits in the restaurant eating steak with the bar owner (Duke Robbilard) while the band sits outside sharing an union, great humor!! "
