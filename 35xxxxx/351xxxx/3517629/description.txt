Known Issues

This are problems you may encounter:

   1. The game may crash when changing resolution from the menu. Change it from file settings.ini in the installation folder. Change the number at the end of the line SET DX_CONFIG_RES to the desired resolution (1 = 640x480, 2 = 800x600, 3 = 1024x768, 4 = 1280x1024, ...).
   2. It is impossible to change language from main menu either. It must be changed from language.ini. (1 = English, 2 = French...). This file will not be created until you start a game, so start one (saving it is not required), then exit.
