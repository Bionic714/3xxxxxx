?????????? INSTALL  NOTES ????????????
UnRAR with WinRAR and Burn or view on your harddrive by clicking on    
either the WindowMode.exe or FullScreenMode.exe files.
????????????? ATTENTION  ????????????
????????????  MAC USERS  ????????????
???????????????????????????????????
The Mac GUI Interface files for the tutorials can now be found in
this upload. These two files (one for FullScreenMode and one for
WindowMode)can be found in the \\\"Mac GUI\\\" folder on all of the CDs
(They\\\'ll need to be extracted from the compressed \\\"Mac GUI Apps.sit\\\"
file - Note: This should ONLY be done on Macs, since Windows messes
up the file structure). All Mac users need to do is replace
FullScreenMode.exe and WindowMode.exe files with the
FullScreenMode.app and WindowMode.app files.

What\\\'s more, these two files are interchangable with all the
Quasi_Mojo Lynda.com Releases/Repacks that have the Lynda.com Flash
GUI Interface. Again, all you would need to do is extract those two
files to the root directory of the various Lynda.com tutorials that
you have.
