,dontaskdonttell,2008-08-16T05:31Z,"ok, that's the real thing. the basis is the same as what you get from qxp download to which mr hubberz just added a very nice xml script ... you now either have to go by the standard installation (don't change anything in the options--or change the script according to what you want)
and BTW, forget the again keymaker (after you have already ignored your virus scanner's screams), it just gives you a key but no activation key. so, no use at all (there come keys with this download).
good work. thanks mr hubberz."
,dontaskdonttell,2008-08-16T05:36Z,"whow sorry, my last comment concerns the qxp 7.31 upload by mr hubberz. link see above."
