Alright, here it is. All dialogs translated with a translationprogram. Its not perfect, but better then nothing. All texts so far in my game works just fine.
Some words couldnt be translated and all english sentence are not correct.
But it works and its better then russian language. All names on characters are also converted to english, some of them looks pretty funny :).
I cant speak a word of russian, remember that *s*.
Enjoy!!
