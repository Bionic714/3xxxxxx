,William Thorpe,2006-08-26T23:55Z,"LOL  As I say I cant speak russian *hehe*
I suppose that dialog comes from one of the drunk barmen?? Looks like it *s*"
,William Thorpe,2006-08-27T00:02Z,"Trader, shipyard, governar, tavernowner itemdealers etc. works fine.
You can even get a good grip when you read tutorialdialogs (people with blue marker).
Sure it fun to read just the worse of those dialogs *hehe*. Anyway play for a while and tell me if its the same or better ;) *s*
(No offensive taken or given)"
,Mr_Blaze,2006-08-27T00:02Z,"Many thanks for this translation, finaly i can play the clean russian patched version. i played it for 2 months ago
and i had a hell with the files i copied and pasted with the earlier patches to get it in english..

(for this i give you four stars)"
,William Thorpe,2006-08-27T00:11Z,"THX a lot man!!! =D
I hate to play when I cant understand anything, so I have to do something about it. Amazing no one have done it before (so far I know). Age of Pirates come out 9th december 2005 in russia as Corsairs3. It wasnt that hard to do it either, but someone have too =). I love this damn game too much, I gonna buy it (bet on it) =)
Hope it works well and THX for those stars."

,William Thorpe,2006-08-27T00:30Z,"I have a translation program under tools.
Maybe I should try this mod. What I know of, there are lot of mods to Age of Pirates. If you try it, dont forget to backup all english dialogs and so on :).
You can always download it again *s* 
thx"

,William Thorpe,2006-08-27T01:10Z,"If you want to work with it, be careful!
