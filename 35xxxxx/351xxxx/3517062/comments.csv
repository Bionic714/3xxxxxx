,artemis+,2006-08-30T04:55Z,"It was a compressed (ie 1.4GB divx) that I re-authored to dvd. I haven't yet found an uncompressed copy. So be warned, video quality isn't perfect."
,Wetbones,2006-08-30T14:12Z,Thanks for the info.
,fallenacorn,2006-10-26T20:34Z,"thank you for this. i saw this opening night in NYC and it really is classic, all-out Gilliam. I mean, don't expect Time Bandits II or anything like that, but die-hard fans will enjoy this film."

,mgchardcore,2008-03-15T01:50Z,"DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS MOVIE, WORST CRAP I HAVE EVER SEEN, REALLY, EVER! WARNING YOU SO THAT YOU WON'T WASTE YOUR TIME LIKE I DID! TITLE MIGHT SOUND INTERESTING BUT THERE'S NO MEANING IN IT, NO STORY, JUST ALL CRAP. WISH IT WAS NEVER MADE IN THE FIRST PLACE. "
,Nickenbokan,2008-07-26T01:08Z,"haven't yet seen this film, but Terry Gilliam has created some of the best films I've ever seen. if you want the same old bullshit Hollywood has been feeding you your whole life, this one's probably not for you
