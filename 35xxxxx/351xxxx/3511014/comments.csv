,50footqueenie,2008-05-21T15:11Z,"Does this work on a mac?  I have been looking on various torrent sites for this and learning xhtml and although they are ""movies"", they are not mac compatible.

Anybody know?  Or better, does anybody have a link to either this or learning xhtml that works on a mac?"

Have a look at this virus analysis of the keygen for Poweriso before using it. [22 virus]

,goive,2008-12-25T14:34Z,"I've just started downloading and I'm on a Mac. Because the package includes three files: a .daa file, an installation of PowerISO and a ReadMe, if you're a Mac user, you don't need to download the PowerISO installation package.
You won't be able to open the .daa image file because it's not directly supported within Mac OS X. Instead, head on down to http://www.twilightedge.com/mac/daaconverter/
to download a free .daa -> .iso tool. That'll convert the .daa file into a .iso which you can then mount and view the vids! Good luck and Merry Christmas!"

,msavic8,2010-03-14T23:59Z,"boys and girls,you'll ned the quicktime player to see the video correctly,secondly neither the power iso nor the keygen is not a virus,this is a noobish observation,thirdly enjoy it and try to learn html already

,XiaKangli,2010-06-25T23:14Z,ALL keygens show as viruses -.- 
,tre.fire,2010-10-16T04:42Z,"I am fully capable of extracting and using this program, but I fail to see the logic behind posting things in such arcane formats. Supplying a PowerISO.exe that one should install seems just a way to force people to use a piece of software they have no need for (I use magic disk and don't need another disk program), or a converter for a rarely used .daa format...there is no need for that and to do so is just a waste of everyone's time. Thanks for the program, Lynda,com is great, but there are other resources equally as through as their stuff that does not have all the hoops and garbage installs included."
,Ancalimon1960,2011-01-02T16:33Z,Thanks for the great upload.. works fine.

better to go for resent lectures"
,snowbirds,2012-03-24T00:45Z,"Okay, to explain what's going on here.  The uploader has uploaded the file in .daa format, which almost no software can open.  

However, he also included PowerISO.exe which CAN convert .daa to .ISO  which many softwares can run [I use MagicISO].

Why he didn't just convert it to ISO before uploading it I do not know.  It seems simpler than forcing every downloader to install new software just to convert this thing to watch it.

If you do want to go to all this trouble to download it and convert it and watch it even though it's about 6 years old, then I recommend finding powerISO's website to DL the software, that way you aren't taking any risks.

Oh, and once I converted .daa to ISO, and then mounted it with MagicISO, and opened the folders and attempted to watch the .mov files with VLC, I only got sound, and no video.  Maybe because the files are 8 years old, and VLC no longer supports that version of .mov?  I don't know.  Perhaps Quicktime would run them, but that would mean another install of a piece of [CR]APple bloatware, which I won't do.

So in other words, I went to a lot of work to watch this for nothing....  Sometimes torrents just need to die.  This is one...

Thanks to the uploader though.  I'm sure it was a really useful torrent for many years."
,RakGuy,2012-07-15T15:03Z,"Nice Work Uploader..
