,darkgamer18,2006-08-31T14:53Z,"I'm sorry. I thought you didn't need a cd key but you do 
V2C47-MK7JD-3R89F-D2KXW-VPK3J a simple solution to never input it again is to read http://unattended.msfn.org/unattended.xp/view/web/1/ and create a Unattended Windows installation"
,darkgamer18,2006-08-31T16:04Z,Yes it's genuine with cdkey and yes you can use it as a bootdisk. Like I said I would create a Unattended Windows installation first and go from there

What ITT do you attend?n/a Can you get more disks?no, I found this on some other site and thought I would post this here for everyone. However I downloaded it and there was no cd key posted with it so I hunted down a working one. All I'm saying is this cd is meant to be copied and passed around for ""schools""(everyone). For copies depending on your needs you might be interested in getting a cd or dvd Duplicator(or if you can find/afford one a replicator :D for making cd/dvd manufactured copies). For cd key to be embedded download this program called n-lite http://www.nliteos.com/ either mount the image in daemon tools, use iso buster or the like and extract to somewhere. open  n-lite, choose either your cd or the directory and add your cd key. There are alot more options on there so mess around to your liking.   "
