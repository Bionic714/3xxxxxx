,JTZer0,2006-09-20T05:41Z,I downloaded the torrent and placed it in my psp iso folder. I'm not sure which emulator to use but I used fastload and all it does is turn off my psp

The torrent name says .RAR, but it's not a rar, it's lots of files with extensions of .001 up to .027."
,Osaka,2006-09-22T19:02Z,I've trested the game now. It works fine with Devhook 46.

,zoson,2007-03-19T18:41Z,just associate winrar with .001 files and you're all set.  no need to rename anything.
