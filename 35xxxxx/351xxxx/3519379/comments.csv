,ronemp1,2006-09-08T09:23Z,"Watch yourself buddy, if u don't like the movies then don't dl it, don't be bitching all day if you don't contribute. axxo makes good rips and in general most of the movies are worth watching. If you have nothing to good to thank for, then it's best to keep it shut. Keep up the good work axxo!"
,SEYKYU,2006-09-09T00:52Z,"you got that right bro if you dont want the film then dont get it,and go somewhere else for your shit.axxo make the best copies !!!!  "
,the unforgiving,2006-09-09T18:20Z,"lol, axxo do have the best rips ive seen on any torrent site. i dont need to read the comments i just no its a gonna be a good copy :)"
,neomoxie,2006-09-09T23:13Z,"Well said indeed, axxo does quality work. If you don't like the film(s), then that's your opinion. 

More so it's your problem, you should have checked IMDB for a review before you downloaded. Are they films I would watch over and over again? Hell no! But damn do I love that I have the oppurtunity to watch quality copies of the films, for free and it's all thanks  to whomever was kind enough do go through the trouble of purchasing, ripping and uploading it for us.

I for one am very apreciative. A thousand thank yous aXXo.

If you don't have anything positive to contribute, then don't contribute. "

Nice work"
,triple,2006-09-23T11:47Z,Comments about quality are interessting for other users. Comments about what people think about the movie self aren't (leave that kind of shit on IMDB). So keep it to yourself will you!

,dWnLd_wHOrE_BiaTCh,2006-10-17T08:59Z,"absolutely true I couldn't agree more with ""asdfx"" aXXo does put out real crappity crappa movies, hollywood w*nk stuff, looks like he's out to get em...

that said, aXXo totally rulz for his quality and number of output, I mean the first thing I lookout for when I login to piratebay are aXXo releases :-)

when we say they stink it's not that we're having a go at aXXo, I just wish he would soon start including some quality classics, some asian, indian and rare to find stuff soon, I mean movies that make u jump from your seat...whatever

lol u idiots who think comments should stay only on imdb and only rip quality should be mentioned, no need for that, if it says aXXo it means QUALITY!

I think ppl should put their movie opions here, its a place for sharing, aXXo is ripping and uploading top notch quality but he's only going for lame hollowwood schmork...

anyway aXXo u r the B E S T !
thank u"

,Jaenus,2007-04-27T22:38Z,"As always, aXXo is great quality.  The movie on the other hand is not so great in my humble opinion.  It's this girl who, by chance, manages to torture a confession out of some guy who she has no real proof has done anything except another guy's confession she tortured out of him.  The movie is poorly put together and I kept wanting the guy to stab her. -.- Save your time."

,chayant.g,2008-02-14T14:38Z,"sorry to keep this argument fuelled, but i think people around here should really think before they type some things. for all you misinformed dolts, aXXo closed down his own account on thepiratebay some time ago, thus all his torrents were removed. since aXXo was such a popular uploader, other people tried to imitate his titles so that they would get more downloaders. take, for instance, this torrent. you can tell at once that it isn't the real aXXo. the uploader is 'axxo-torrents' whereas it should be 'axxo'. i'm not saying that the quality of the torrent is necessarily bad if it isn't aXXo's, but it isn't necessarily good either just because it has his name on it. therefore it really is useful for people to comment on the quality of a torrent. also, i guess even the best uploader can have a bad day or uses a bad computer or something and his torrent's quality isn't up to snuff. all i'm saying is that people are helping out by telling us whether it's a good torrent or a bad one. i guess all you newcomers will understand when you start actually getting familiar with downloading."
,chayant.g,2008-02-14T14:43Z,"oh, and as for what you guys think about the movie itself... thanks, but no thanks. everyones opinion is different and something that i like may not appeal to someone else. we'd rather not have this space clogged up by people fighting over whether the movie was worth watching or not, regardless of your good (or otherwise) intentions. and just for the record - it's a great quality upload. thanks!"

,trigidey,2008-06-05T13:59Z,"I agree with you chayant.g. I'm not interested in getting some dumb-ass information about how this movie was for a jackass who just watched it in agony to see some flesh or horror. I'm downloading this movie because I saw it on DVD and now I want it on my computer, so I have already seen it and consider it good. Very intense and intimidating, but good.

,Ms_Medea,2010-03-14T12:24Z,"I have something to say to chayant.g-

""we'd rather not have this space clogged up by people fighting over whether the movie was worth watching or not""

Who is this ""we"" that you're speaking for? Suddenly you're the voice for all the users on the entire site? Wow...

You must think pretty highly of yourself to have the nerve for this comment, particularly when there was already someone who proved you wrong by posting that they believe the comment space should be for sharing of all kinds of information and not just A/V quality. 

People post all kinds of things in the comment section- questions about the torrent or downloading torrents in general, requests for other movies, praise for the torrent provider- is all of this clutter ""we'd rather not have"" as well? How useful is it to post a comment about how awesome Axxo is or how happy you are this movie was made available or thanking him/her profusely? Not very. But it's polite and a nice thing to do. It's also possible that knowing they're appreciated helps in encouraging the person to add new torrents, thus contributing to the site as a whole to benefit of everyone. Does that mean these things are acceptable to comment on?

My point is this- I find it useful (some of the time) to read comments about what people think of the movies, and since this is a sharing based community people should be able to offer up whatever it is they want to say, whether it's a simple ""thank you"", giving details on the torrent quality, adding their feelings about the film, or addressing an irritatingly high-handed comment by another user who had the gall to think that they can speak on everyone else's behalf. "
,daveydudely,2010-03-29T01:21Z,"What a great movie, just two actors commanding the screen so well- and one of them just 17.  Direction, camera and editing are all nicely restrained.  An impressive little film."

,thegreatbuddha15,2010-08-02T15:35Z,"@Ms_Medea

I get what you are trying to say

but discussion about the quality of a movie in a setting like this almost invariably leads to arguments and/or flame wars

if i wanted to know what people think of a movie i would go to a dedicated movie forum (or imageboard)

there are hundreds of websites dedicated to discussing movies and personally i would rather the arguments take place there, and here i would like to see mostly comments about A/V quality, what kind of download speed people are getting, technical issues etc etc 

i will concede the inanity of uploader-praise comments is kind of unneeded but i think i can speak for most when i say they are more welcome than a bunch of personal insults against people with different opinions than ones own
"
,Sit3UserX,2010-10-26T10:08Z,Great print! a10/v10
,chayant.g,2011-01-02T04:53Z,"@Ms_Medea

I just saw this after nearly two years and saw that my comment had quite a fallout, so decided to address the issue.

First off, I'd like to apologize for the tone of my previous torrent - it was certainly uncalled for and was from the viewpoint of a fairly angry, pompous 16 year old. I agree that I don't speak for everyone (which is obvious considering I also said something to the effect of ""people have differing opinions"") and if that came out, I apologize.
However I still hold to my point. I know that it's extremely frustrating to try to download a torrent and find a string of comments below that don't say whether or not it's worth downloading. As a personal choice, I only download movies that I have checked reviews of already and have a fairly good idea what to expect. There are sites specific to these needs and I don't think of TPB as one of them, so after a point, squabbling over preferences gets tedious.
It's obvious that people will have very varying opinions over each movie but to get into full-scale, space consuming wars over such matters seems a little too much.
I would also like to point out that comments about quality, criticism about the torrent/uploader and praise or otherwise of a torrent is something that I value and I did thank the uploader in my last comment because I felt that this was a job well done, not because I felt it was necessary. These are grey areas of course on where to draw the line.
In short, I'm glad you decided to confront me. It was a while ago and I see where it came across as offensive.

Ps. This probably contradicts my original comments since it is not specific to this torrent or uploader, but I felt it was necessary to address your comment with an apology/clarification. Thanks for your feedback"

The comments section, first and foremost, is for commenting on quality and offering relevant info or asking questions, but the only comments that piss me off are the assholes ripping other people for leaving negative ratings on quality. Yeah, I know it's free, I wasn't complaining about the price. I leave a negative rating to help others, not to insult the uploader, and it's one of the aspects of TPB that makes it so reliable. 

Anyway, thanks axxo...
