,FunkyHonky,2006-09-02T00:03Z,"I'm not sure if this is the same version I d/l'd, but when I played the game the audio and video were about 6 seconds out of sync with each other on all the fmv's. Might not sound like much but a big part of the game is in those clips so it kinda killed the atmosphere for me."

Henry Townshend finds himself trapped in his own cursed apartment. Only by exploring mysterious portals leading to disturbing alternate worlds will Henry begin to uncover clues as to why he is trapped. Such is the premise of Silent Hill 4 The Room, a more action-focused entry into Konami's survival horror series. Features include a higher number of weapons and enemies than previous games in the series, changes to the environment in real time, shifts between the first- and third-person perspective, and various visual and control upgrades to the Silent Hill 3 engine. Levels include a forest, a prison and a hotel. 

Problems ?
If you notice that the voice is out of sync then you have to change your region to NTSC whit an program that should be located in your application use programs like Englishmans swichdisc and change to NTSC. If your picture gets Black and white, your tv don`t support  NTSC
