,omechron,2007-06-30T01:03Z,"This is NOT a virus, it runs perfectly fine. Looks like a pretty cool fangame. I wish it was a little more creative... most people who would play it at all know the story by heart, so a totally new story would be more fun."
,MemmoX,2007-11-14T19:57Z,"This is not a Virus. I made this game.
If it doesn't work, then YOU have a virus.

Also this was locked with a cracked program
and virus scanners see that as a virus too.
