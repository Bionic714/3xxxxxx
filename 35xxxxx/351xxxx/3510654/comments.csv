,brent7890,2007-09-23T01:09Z,"This is my first time dealing with clone cd's. I understand there is a special way to burn the items to a cd, or a step you must take for the actual game to read it as an official cd, because i burned it all to a cd, and it dosnt recognize that it is a cd with all of the files on it. An easier way to say this is that, when I play the game, it tells me to insert cd 1 or 2, when i already burned the goddam files to the cd, and its in the drive at the moment. So some help would be greatly apprieciated."
