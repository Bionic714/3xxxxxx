Synopsis

A seaplane lands on the island of Talua to unload three criminals - including Harry (Academy Award® Winner Frank Sinatra, 1954 Best Actor in a Supporting Role, From Here to Eternity) - plus a young priest, Father Perreau (Kerwin Mathews), who has come to succeed aging, irascible Father Doonan (Academy Award® Winner Spencer Tracy, 1938 Best Actor in a Leading Role, Captains Courageous and 1939 Best Actor in a Leading Role, Boys Town). When an earthquake and volcanic eruption strike Talua, Father Doonan persuades Harry to parachute with him into the mountains on a daring rescue to an isolated hospital. The party - mostly children - is menaced by landslides, forest fires, flowing lava and the near-collapse of a footbridge as they make their perilous way to safety. Tracy and Sinatra are in peak form as the unlikely heroes of this suspense-filled adventure..
