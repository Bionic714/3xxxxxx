REVIEW
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Recorded at Analogueland Studio.
Final mastering and enhancements by Steve Roach at the Timeroom
Composed and performed by Jeffrey Koepper 

Steve Roach - xpander textures on track 2,6 and 7
Kelvin Russel - additional synthesizers on track 1 

Track 3 is dedicated to the memory of Michael Garrison 

Jeffrey obviously loves his analogue synths as he lists the ones used by each track. So for you 'gear heads' out there they include. PPGwave , loads of Arps, Rolands (including Jupiter 4, 6 and 8), Moog, Prophet 5, Oberheim, Elka etc etc etc.

Wonderful little melodic touches and twittering electronics are punctuated by dark pulses, then in enters a fantastic one hundred mile an hour sequence as the 'Byzantine Machine' explodes into life. A melodic rhythmic loop increases the oomph factor still further. 'Outside' cools things down somewhat with loads of slow atmospheric pads and strange alien noises. 'Godspeed 2' (dedicated to the memory of Michael Garrison) wastes no time is cranking up the sequences again (3 ARP ones this time!), each being deployed one after the other to create a very pleasurable wall of ever shifting pulsations. Sonic whooshes come and go over the top like spaceships flying low above our heads. 'Sense of Time' again uses cosmic 'twitters' to great effect then in come the sequences again in very 'Rubycon' fashion. Vast powerful stabs add to the excitement as yet more lines of bubbling mayhem spew forth. I'm losing count of the number of sequencer lines and yet more seem to come, all shifting around each other. A cracking lead line joins in the fray. What an awesome track. The aural equivalent of a nuclear reactor going to meltdown! 

'Eternal Sea' starts with an incredibly deep bass sequence, other notes sort of fizzing from the edges. It's all brooding ominous stuff. Another sequence joins the first, itself oozing menace. Percussion is added. It's as if energy is rising like solar flares, escaping a sphere or forecfield that isn't up to containing such a pulsating mass of energy. '2600 A.D.' is a short cosmic collage of electronic whooshes, gurgles and twitters which I bet was great fun to do. It acts as an introduction to the awesome 'Sequential Meditation' which continues straight on without a break. A heavy four-note sequence is initially the main feature but before long more sequences come to join it. It all morphs wonderfully, little percussive detail and electronic effects coming and going in the background. As the track progresses things become increasingly intense. It is a track with real venom and attitude. 

We follow straight through to 'Awakening' which effectively acts as the third part of an almost twenty-five minute piece. The main sequence now develops a sort of skip to its step whist melodic runs of notes playfully dart in and out of the other pulsations. Fans of seventies style sequencer music will just love this CD. (DL)
