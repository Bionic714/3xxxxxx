,I_QBot,2006-08-14T22:23Z,"Silliness... this Fryman guy just doesn't get it. Muslims (some), in particular, want free thinkers dead because we don't believe as they do, and therefore, all westerners must die. THEY believe in everybody must die, WE believe in everybody has a right to be free (of thought and expression). Simple as that. "
,piratebill,2006-08-14T23:49Z,"You write like an intelligent person, but you have alas taken on  the media led sound bytes of propaganda. People such as yourself are in fact the real problem, because by having bought into the propaganda from the powers that be which demonises the Muslim world, you empower our leaders to continue with this hopeless, savage and murderous war."
,I_QBot,2006-08-15T00:48Z,"I don't listen to our media anymore than I do this Fryman guy. I don't want to hurt (or murder them), but they sure want me dead. They are demonized because of these murderous rampages they go on. Everybody seems to forget WE didn't start this war in Lebanon (for instance), fanatical Muslims did, and its only because they just don't like the Jews. Has nothing to do with the U.S."
,piratebill,2006-08-15T01:48Z,"The thing is, it's not just about the Muslim world. America is the new Rome dominating the world, and that has to be the starting point for any understanding of international affairs. The Muslims have oil. The West wants it. So please do not insult the intelligence of us all here in trying to say the US is blameless in this affair. You are in denial IQbot, and until you and your kind start facing up to the guilt of how the West and America has screwed and continues to screw the rest of the world, there wil be no peace."
,I_QBot,2006-08-15T03:41Z,"YOU may feel guilty, I know not what for, but I for one, do not. Self pity is a terrrible thing. Since the world economy depends on oil, all this government wants is a stable supply, not world domination. It's attitudes like yours that cause all the strife in the world right now. Oh, and what intellingence have I seen here? Nothing but Conspiracy theory. Like I said - Silliness."
,vper1,2006-08-15T05:41Z,"I_Qbot, piratebill hit it on the nose with his first comment that you have been taken by the media sound bytes. You may not listen or watch mainstream media, but you sound exactly like a future Tucker Carlson to me. You are using the term ""conspiracy theory"" to discredit and belittle. Have you read the book? "
,piratebill,2006-08-15T10:40Z,"Your words IQbot (thankyou Vper) are those of prejudice. You probably know that the views you present are either one sided or at best biassed. You are like a cruel father who will not say anything good about his son. As you say, you have no guilt, and presumably therefore you also have no pity. I would guess that you had a cruel father who was very grudging in his acceptance of you, and likewise, you are the same as to others, including the Muslims."
,I_QBot,2006-08-16T16:06Z,"If you people, and this Fryman guy, think that at the ROOT of all the evil, and death, going on in the mideast is the US and the UK, then you are some seriously deluded folk."
,vper1,2006-08-16T17:10Z,"I_Qbot, why did the U.S. invade Iraq again? Why are we still there you say? Afghanistan too you say? 

Why did Israel invade Lebanon? Prisoners? How many Lebanese prisoners did Israel have before the invasion? How many Palestinian prisoners? You might want to check some of their receipts as well, we made sure they were able to pulverize their civilian targets.

Do you honestly think if our way of life is non-negotiable, that bombing (or clandestine activities) the bejesus out of others will make them complacent? Oil must be running through your veins."
,piratebill,2006-08-16T19:19Z,"What Sam Fryman has written in this article is an objective view and none of it is conspiracy theory. There is not one word in it that is conspiracy theory. It is obvious to anyone with half a brain that American dominates the world with its lap dog England and ally Israel which holds a huge arsenal of conventional and nuclear weapons to dominate and terrify the middle eastern Muslims. Only someone in total denial of reality could hold the views that IQbot is expressing. IQbot is not interested in logic, but only hate and vengeance. The vast majority of Muslims only ask one thing - that the Western allies cease to intimidate and dominate the middle east and stay out of their countries."
,spawny1,2006-09-07T12:41Z,"o dear piratebill, the world is so black and white for you people isn't it. One one side you have the great satan (USA) and unfortunately on the other side we've got you bleeding hearts. Yes, the war in Iraq is predominantly for oil, but who would really say that the prospect of Iraq without Saddam is a bad aim. As far as i can see, its not the US who are doing all the damage over there but the Arabs killing each other (don't tell me, thats the Allies fault too!!). I don't see where your logic works in the Afganistan comment vper1, i'm not sure theres much oil out there!

Lets get realistic about this, its a big bad world out there, there are bad people on both sides and bad decisions on both sides, but the demonisation of the west is far more prevalent over in the middle east than we experience in the west....."
,piratebill,2006-09-15T10:57Z,"Yes, that's right Spawny1 - it's a big bad world out there, because people like yourself are not willing to see the other guy's point of view, and any one who is gets referred to as ""a bleeding heart."" All Sam is doing here is suggesting that the West negotiates with the so called 'terrorists' to find a peaceful solution. It WORKED with the IRA, who no longer bomb mainland UK. But the American and Israeli leadership does not even TRY to find a peaceful solution, and just tells lies to justify its latest domination plans. But then again, it sounds like you believe everything the mainstream media tells you, which is both naive and UNREALISTIC to say the least. And please, do not give us the tired 'they are better off without Sadam' and equate the American PEOPLE with their government, as the two are not at all the same thing. 

And yes, as to 'black and white', of course, things are NEVER that simple as you say, for people who don't want to play fair. The only reason the world is big and bad is because people like yourself muddle the issue and refuse to see black is black, and white is white. "
