Anyone having to resort to religion and take it THAT seriously does not belong in this world."
,rockstar11998,2008-04-06T18:12Z,"muddu - LOL. Your comment about all non Muslims going to hell has no justification.  So Moses, Abraham, Isaac, and all the people you revere as prophets and good people are going to hell because I know none of them were ever Muslims.  Muslims are taught by the Koran to spread 'Allah's' faith through force, killing, and hatred.  I really don't like Islam or any other religion that makes claims such as you did saying all people not of your faith are doomed.  That is not a Just God you speak of.  My religion accounts for all of God's children no matter what age they have lived in.  All will have a chance for forgiveness of sins and the opportunity to accept or reject Him and Jesus Christ.

I have seen this video and it is excellent.  It really shows how connected Islam is with Nazis."

,sevenarmy,2009-05-19T05:02Z,"The power and love of God to Israel are here made the ground and reason of a number of cautions and serious warnings; and although there is much reference to their national covenant, yet all may be applied to those who live under the gospel. What are laws made for but to be observed and obeyed? Our obedience as individuals cannot merit salvation; but it is the only evidence that we are partakers of the gift of God, which is eternal life through Jesus Christ, Considering how many temptations we are compassed with, and what corrupt desires we have in our bosoms, we have great need to keep our hearts with all diligence. Those cannot walk aright, who walk carelessly. Moses charges particularly to take heed of the sin of idolatry. He shows how weak the temptation would be to those who thought aright; for these pretended gods, the sun, moon, and stars, were only blessings which the Lord their God had imparted to all nations. It is absurd to worship them; shall we serve those that were made to serve us? Take heed lest ye forget the covenant of the Lord your God. We must take heed lest at any time we forget our religion. Care, caution, and watchfulness, are helps against a bad memory."
