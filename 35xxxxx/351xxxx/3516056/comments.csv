If there is anyone out there who could help us get that 0.4% that is so little and yet so much, I can speak on behalf of everyone:  It would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you for your time.

Also, the aforementioned online version is in English.  I'm almost afraid to ask, but is the torrent also translated?  I certainly hope not and will respond with a follow-up as soon as I can see the scans for myself... Thank you, again."
