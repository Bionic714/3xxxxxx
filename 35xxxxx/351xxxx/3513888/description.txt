Better known for his tech-funk and house, this is Japanese producer Susumu Yokota's second collection of experimental music to be released by the Leaf label [following "Image 1983-1988"]. The thematic titles to the tracks-"Weave", "Unravel", "Spool", "Stitch", "Fiber"--are an indication of what to expect; a clinically-executed examination of sound texture. But to Yokota's credit the formalism is expertly reigned in to let the music breathe. "Weave" gently undulates with material created from disparate musical strands. "Reflux" gradually regiments the elements to a stuttering beat while maintaining a dark seam underneath while "Unravel" is the sound of incongruent elements rubbing against each other. "Metabolic" is timed to a thumping heartbeat which Yokota gradually overpowers with multiple layers of irregularly-timed rhythms. Magic Thread is a record to get wrapped up in.--Chris Campion
