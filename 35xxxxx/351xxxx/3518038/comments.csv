I have it installed on a lot of machines in my business which require a ""fresh state"" in the early morning hours."
,uraphake,2006-09-01T21:02Z,"The real thing can be found here: http://users.pandora.be/jbosman/applications.html

This utility is great on machines running older operating systems like Windows ME and 98. It will even schedule a reboot of a networked computer."
