,AtlasRaven,2006-08-25T19:26Z,Enjoy :) And post comments if I can improve the torrent or tracker in any way. I'll check and respond to people that have errors and need help.
,AtlasRaven,2006-08-25T19:36Z,ENJOY!! :) Let me know if I can help you or improve the torrent.
,Robbie785,2006-08-25T21:49Z,"thanks man, love this game, will be nice to be able to finally play it on XP :)"
,Robbie785,2006-08-25T21:55Z,"it's not showin any seeds, just FYI, i hope somebody seeding it :)"
,AtlasRaven,2006-08-26T00:20Z,"Sry for the double post. I'm doing the initial super-seeding, it doesn't show as a seed when you do that."
,extrudedplasticdingus,2006-08-26T16:23Z,"Ironically, I went to play this game this morning for the first time in a year or two, but have lost my soviet disk.  Thanks for uploading."
,uberghost,2006-08-27T20:17Z,"Can someone please seed this torrent, ive been at 99.8% for 2 days"
,AtlasRaven,2006-08-28T03:24Z,"Patience while everyone gets to 100%, then availability should jump as more ppl seed."
,soulbringer1,2006-08-28T16:49Z,2006-08-25 i began downloading Red Alert ..but why dosent it complete? plz do something so atleast some of all the 50 users who has 99.8% done get ready so there is more seeders . feels like timewaste here ... regards grottis
,AtlasRaven,2006-08-28T17:31Z,I'm baffled. I'm still seeding it and I am moving it as fast as I can to peers at 98%. Patience it is a new torrent( only 3 days old) with no 100% seeds except myself.
,AtlasRaven,2006-08-29T23:45Z,Ignore my last post. People are seeding and it will be more available/faster as those people grow.
,soulbringer1,2006-08-31T22:32Z,"Hums under the night when i where downloading the block dissapered *wiee* what a fun game :) an old classig *Great Seed m8* for some user ther might be a problem with soundcard . well thats no problem anymore open ""Redalert.ini"" And in the first chapter ther is 4 columns just type in the infor that you get from *system* about youre soudcards  IRQ , Port and Cardplace . and fixed  "
,AtlasRaven,2006-09-01T06:24Z,Nice! In rectrospect I maybe should have included Redalert.ini although it will run perfectly fine without it. You can get the Rules.ini from Rich at: http://www.r1ch.net/old/ra/rules.zip. Put it in the game folder (C:Westwood\Red Alert) but you can only play with ppl that have matching rules.ini
,darthcornel,2006-09-10T15:46Z,hmm i can only find my IRQ but the rest i cant find do u know some other way where i can find the DMA and the rest ? plz
,AtlasRaven,2006-09-11T21:23Z,"How To Find DMA/IRQ/PORT Settings:
Sound Blaster default- IRQ:5 DMA:1 PORT:220, worth trying if you don't know.
You can find your settings if you open AUTOEXEC.NT(WinXP) in C:\Windows\system32 with notepad and AUTOEXEC.BAT for older. I think the RA1 iso has a sound setup under the install or setup folder (not sure which). Just don't go editing it unless you know what you're doing.

,bitemybutt,2006-09-12T07:19Z,"Can smb help me pls.I keep getting the following error msg:""The Win16 Subsystem has insufficent resources to continue running.Click OK,close your applications and restart your machine.""I do everything as the readme says but still can't manage to pass this.It gives it when i click ""Install"""
,bitemybutt,2006-09-12T16:58Z,"oh,sorry for the inconvinience i solved the problem"
,vaughneagan,2006-09-15T04:22Z,"can any one help?
 im unsure if you have to burn the iso file direct to disk or extract the files first to get it to work right. ive had problems w/ other programs and am sick of wasting dvd disks for no reason, so i thought id ask first.
please, anyone inthe know, help!"
,vaughneagan,2006-09-15T04:23Z,"also, does anyone have daemon tools that arent associated with that pesky whenu bullcrap?"
,AtlasRaven,2006-09-15T18:16Z,"You don't have to burn the ISO to dvd, although it might be possible to do it that way. I'd recommend using Daemon tools or 120 alcohol or whatever you use to mount the iso."
,D34D666,2006-09-22T01:32Z,"whohoo , my childhood has become a download ^^"

,D34D666,2006-09-23T06:41Z,"ok forget my last msg ,because 1 day later i have it all :D ill be seeding it from now"
,InFlames_NL,2006-09-23T14:37Z,"Cool :D I bought win 95 edition red alert and it was crap so I'm very happy with this one ^^

One question though. The site about that LAN program said that you can only play one hour with the demo version of that program. Is that the case with what's in this Torrent too? That would suck :( I want to play longer than one hour!"
,InFlames_NL,2006-09-23T14:38Z,p.s.... seeding like hell :D
,AtlasRaven,2006-09-26T19:14Z,"About the 1hr TCPcom limit: I'm fairly sure i've had some games last longer then one hour, but I haven't ever got cutoff. I'll experiment a little and post the results."
