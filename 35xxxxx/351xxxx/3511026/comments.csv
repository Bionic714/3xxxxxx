,DanLoader,2006-11-12T22:47Z,"Uhhh what? What I see in this file is a PowerISO file, for Windows. No actual Lynda.com file of any kind. Just PowerISO, and a KeyGen folder.

In other words.... FAKE."
,lollielala,2006-12-17T04:35Z,"This torrent contains 3 files:

1. Photoshop CS2 and Flash 8 Integration.txt
2. Lynda.com - Photoshop CS2 and Flash 8 Integration.daa
3. PowerISO v3.3.rar

.daa is a file format native to power iso.

I haven't yet downloaded all of this torrent - but chances are, it is NOT a fake.

Love Lollie"
,shypys,2007-06-08T10:50Z,"You guys amuse me to no end. This is not a fake. .daa files are image files which can be burned on a cd/dvd or mounted on a virtual disk using power iso/alcohol/daemon tools.
