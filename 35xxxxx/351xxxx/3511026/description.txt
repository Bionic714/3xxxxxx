Photoshop CS2 and Flash 8 Integration
with: Michael Ninness

Photoshop CS2 & Flash 8 Integration is a series of video-based tutorials designed to show you the most efficient 
methods for importing content created with Adobe Photoshop CS2 into Macromedia Flash Professional 8, while 
maintaining as much of the original appearance as possible. You will learn how to take advantage of the new 
bitmap features in Flash Professional 8, such as filters and blend modes. The tutorials will also show you how to 
control the optimization settings in Flash for bitmap images when they are embedded inside exported SWF files, 
and how to load external bitmaps into Flash movies.
