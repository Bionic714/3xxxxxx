SORRY FOR THE F==K UP - This torrent now has Laurel and Hardy speaking Spanish language for the two marked films below (the rest are in English).  Problem was an up to date version of DVDFab removing all other languages apart from English.  The previous DVD18 torrent has been removed!!!

Original English speaking language with subs (except for the silents
and the Spanish ones).
I always leave in other languages and subtitles however the Retail DVD
Source does not come with any other language or subs.      :(


Full DVD9 RIP (onto 1 DVD5), PAL format, 4:3
(DVDFab, CCE 10 passes, DVD Rebuilder)

This torrent contains the VIDEO_TS folder.

Burn this onto DVDR using your favourite DVD burning software - 
if you don't know how to burn these onto DVDR's, get Nero and search
on Google.  Then print the DVD Cover and DVD Inlay Booklet (oh yes
you get this too).

I noticed that some of the colour versions are slightly shorter
than the B&W versions.  In Brats, for example, you'll see that
some small scenes were cut out of the colour version and so is
shorter than the restored B&W version.  Brats is on DVD Vol 5.
Note that colourised versions are not as sharp as the B&W versions,
although this is normal if you've ever seen a L&H colourised
version before.


You can download all torrents done so far by going to 
http://www.thepiratebay.org.  They're having a few issues at the
moment, so all back torrents should re-appear soon.
Any suggestions - please leave in comments.
