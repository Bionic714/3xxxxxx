FUR ON THE ASPHALT: The Greg the Bunny Reunion Special
We are proud to announce that we have just completed shooting on a new, half-hour special for the Independent Film Channel, the same channel where Greg first got his start (before selling out to be a sitcom star). Written, Directed and Produced by the original creators (Sean Baker, Spencer Chinoy and Dan Milano) this new special finds Greg and Warren both desperate for work after having lost the Fox show to poor ratings.

Encouraged by puppet agent Pal Friendlies to star in a new IFC special, Greg and Warren must unite and go to Vegas in order to recruit fellow fallen star, Count Blah. What ensues is thirty minutes of debauchery and irreverence, completely unsuitable for family viewing. Human guest stars include Fox alum Seth Green, Sarah Silverman and Bob Gunton, as well as cameos from Jon Favreau, Adam Goldberg, Clint Howard, Martha Plimpton and Lou Ferigno.
