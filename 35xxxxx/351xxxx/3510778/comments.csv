Help me!
Hjälp mig!"
,yoleven,2006-10-08T17:28Z,"To play the game you simply ""click"" the file called ""install.exe"" in the pippi folder that was down loaded.  Then play the game.  You don't need to burn it to a cd at all.  
Game works fine but it is very simple.  (Maybe for very young kids.)"

Now for all the parents that do not know how to help their kids.
To install you should be able to just click the file named Install or setup. And then it should install the game. But it seems to me that this should be a ISO file. So i suggest burning a ISO file. You can google for "" build a ISO disc"" or something. the forums at www.tankafett.se got a guide how to build a ISO. 
Thats all i have to say..

Dont forget to seed! 
Save the children seed the torrents!"
