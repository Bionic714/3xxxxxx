To the guy who commented about people not seeding...why don't you get the idea of BT and get some fucking patience you moronic pleb.  I hope you do go and buy it cos' I would feel pissed off to know I was sharing any of my fucking data with a prick like you.

has anyone managed to get disc 2 working?"
,crowsmokesweed,2008-03-07T15:31Z,"This is really ""GSP software DRIVING TEST (ALL 3 TESTS IN 1 FOR THE UK AND IRELAND 2006!) 
and not ""LDC"" as stated
cheers 4 the up anyway guys : )"
,koolie,2008-06-02T22:14Z,"This is the LDC Theory and Hazard Perception discs, and not GSP as someone claims, it's free from viruses (to my knowledge) however it is a 2006 version and alas, has 35 questions instead of the new 50 questions. the new pass rate is 43 out of 50 yet you can't configure the 35 questions to give you more. It does however if anyone is interested have 2006 stock questions on both car and motorcycle tests.
