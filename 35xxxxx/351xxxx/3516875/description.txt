This is an alternate copy of the second OVA that I found, I figured you guys here would appreciate both versions being posted since this is  a different frame size, which probably dosent matter, but the thought counts, Ive heard over on other sites this supposedly has subtitles, but so far amoung the players ive used, I havent seen any, so no promises/

You allready know the story since you hunted this down, so I wont bore you with the details, But for those who havent, this one is based on the second of the Manga series, its imperfect if your a hardcore follower and believer that the book version is the best, but Its somthing that blows the origional series out of the water, so enjoy.
