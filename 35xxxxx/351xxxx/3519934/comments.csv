,manti6999,2006-09-08T04:23Z,dont download crappy version wait for official version
,Pentagram010,2006-09-15T14:24Z,Umm... who idiot made this torrent? Evanescence isn't even partially gothic and even less gothic rock band.
,brijones,2006-09-15T16:33Z,"What are you talking about? Of course it is gothic. Geez, I suggest you go and listen to something other then fallen. A few of the other CD's are pretty gothic. But then again, what truely is gothic? The genre is so damn done to death."
,Pentagram010,2006-09-16T16:57Z,"No, it's not goth band, and not even rock band. Evanescence is just an ordinary metal band, not rock, and if you want to know what is difference between rock bands and goth rock bands, you can go and try to find a album of Siouxie and banshees, Joy Division or Sex Gang Children and compare them to any normal rock band.

Just having black clothes and grimm lyrics makes no one a goth band. That's a fact that many just don't seem to understand.

And gothic genre is not dead, it just isn't mainstream."
