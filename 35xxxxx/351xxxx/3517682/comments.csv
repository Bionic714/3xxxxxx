,Kihlstroem,2006-08-31T19:51Z,Never ever let this movie leave PB! 
,Goflorp2,2006-08-31T23:22Z,"Fatal Error : not a valid bencoded string

very funny.

It even asks me if I want to quit Bittorrent. Is this made on purpose you fuckhead!"
,tof,2006-09-02T09:16Z,"funny thing about popular american science documentaries, they use up 140 mins and say absolutely nothing. Brian Green is a playboy, a new Carl Sagan with shinier trappings. He conjures up expert after expert and the only thing the are allowed to say is, like ""matter consits a tiny wiggeling strings, they exist in an 11-dimensional space"". Either the american ppl are disturbingly stupid or the assumpsion is that they are, which is also disturbing. This doc is just one of many symptoms of the sickness in the one-dimensional american society. But hey, thats just my opinion..."

yes, I agree this is pretty basic and repetitive.. but the topics being discussed here are extremely complex.  If you want more depth, you need to have a solid background in mathematics and physics, and you need to read books and scientific papers rather than watching a science doc meant for the masses.  I mean.. what is it exactly you expect from a science program on TV?  Unless you're a scientist or mathematician, this is good basic introduction into the concepts and ideas behind string theory.  Brian Green has written a book on string theory.. you can read that if you want more depth.

az5,

that was an excellent explanation of how to imagine higher dimensions.  Thanks for the link."
,dynasoar,2006-09-08T02:47Z,"Not to criticize the uploader for making this available here, but you can get the entire program plus extras from the PBS site: http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/elegant/ 
(just in case it loses its seeding here)."
,redox1,2007-08-08T01:22Z,"Have to agree with tof. Bunch of pseudo-scientific babble designed to impress the uninformed. Nice moneyspinner. The guy is an excellent salesman, but he is not a scientist. "
,lord_of_war,2007-11-28T04:39Z,"at least science is trying to understand. religion prefers it to stay in the past. both bizarre, but science is approachable to new ideas."
,ssj11_Vejito,2007-12-29T21:04Z,"First of all tof is dumbass. I agree with Temptation, but he/she was way too nice in putting it. String theory, although just theoretical, is probably the next General/Special Relativity. Note that I said probably. You think the general public would even begin to understand if Brian started to spew out all the mathematical/scientific proof for it...? That is why they made something to introduce it to the general public. So don't go around saying ignorant things if you don't understand it.

(I'm copying and pasting this message so it may sound weird.)
Second of all,

don't download this one!! The torrent has the DVD quality version of his awesome series. But since it huge we need as many seeds as possible.

http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3555227/Nova__The_Elegant_Universe_(2003)_%5BDVDx3%5D_%5BNTSC%5D_%5B16x9%5D

It is already up to like 20 seeds. The quality of this page's torrent is really bad and pixelated. Actually just a rip from the low quality version from the PBS site. The link above is directly form the DVD set. So please download from there. It will be worth it.

Thank you. :)"

,zushigreg,2008-05-28T16:37Z,"The comments here largely miss the point. I have only seen the TED video so far (20 minutes or so, on youtube, etc.) and it is plainly communicated, without reverting to higher level math, that:
1) anyone can join in the discussion in science. It is inherently inquiring. There is no Pope or censor of any kind.
2) String Theory is another conceivable model of the universe. The simplicity and beauty of the theory is complemented by its breadth. One simple theory answers more questions than any other, though it is untested . . .

If the ""theory"" is truly untested, or without confirmation, then it is actually a hypothesis, not a theory. I imagine the determination of one number (pi, e, c  (velocity of light), plank's constant, etc.), other numbers come tumbling out (sorry I can 't give an example now). It does, nonetheless, have confirmation. What is needed to elevate it the level of theory is prediction and confirmation. That is what the Large Hadron Collider may be able to determine."
,dave_stein,2008-06-17T00:41Z,does anyone know the name of the string theory doc that aired on the science channel a few months back? it wasn't this one. the one I watched was a lot better.
,Dmaj87,2009-03-07T20:16Z,"funny thing about tof, he use up a comment long enough to be a novel and say absolutely nothing. Blah blah blah, playboy and shinier trappings. He believes he's an expert. but if you read between the lines, the only thing he says is, like ""i didn't understand a damn string, I must be one-dimensional"". Either tof is disturbingly stupid or he's simply one-dimensional, which is also disturbing (cause he just can't be). tof is just one of many symptoms of the sickness in his own mind. But hey, thats just his opinion... "
,mrtvi,2010-05-06T21:17Z,"no, tof is right, you have to watch the same blabbing three times"
,Masleyko,2011-06-17T15:54Z,"Lets see ... i`m looking for documentaries like this .. so far watched historys channel The Universe  series with nasa scientist and university profesors .. then stephen hawkings universe , and into universe with stephen hawking .. those are scientifically interesting .. curious about greene ..dont u know some more series about astro anything ?
