I installed everything correctly and when I start the game with the second disk in the intro starts but when that finishes it asks me to insert the correct disk  =["
,makeitcrispy,2007-08-29T10:03Z,"problem solved =D

the file on the second disk which needs to be in the computer when you start is an .iso

what you need to do is unpack the .iso [I used winrar] and burn the contents onto a separate disk.

Be sure to burn each file separately, not under one folder. Use that disk as the start up disk and everything should run 100% ok.  "

,Gunsmith,2009-09-03T05:12Z,"I love how rude some people here are. Folks, it's really easy. Get a program like Magic or Power ISO, Daemon Tools, Alcohol 120%, whatever have you. Make two virtual drives and mount both GTA_Vice_City.iso and Vice_City_Play.iso. Go to the first one and run it. If it won't run with a double click, explore the drive and run the setup.exe.

Install everything, finish and exit. Now, download this No-CD version of the client at MegaGames. [1.0 for this.]

Replace what's in that download with what's in the installation directory.

Finally, if you're running Vista or Windows 7, right click the .exe and set it for Windows XP SP3 compatibility mode, to run as administrator, and if on 7, to disable visual themes and desktop composition. 

It should work 100% flawless as it has for me. Good upload alienseeder, this upload's one of about 30 I'm gonna seed until 20.0 ratio. "

,Jamaibloos1,2010-01-05T16:28Z,Thanks
,schmitty84,2010-01-06T20:34Z,Best advice I can give at the time is go to game copy world dot com and download a crack if there isn't one already included with this download. After you download the crack put it in the game folder in program files. This is located in the C:/ drive or whatever the hdd of windows is. Then select copy and replace. Then right click the icon that starts the game and select run as admin. You should be good to go after that.
,psyc213,2010-01-18T07:16Z,"vistafag here.

I used DAEMON Tools Lite (4.30.4.0027) for mounting purposes.

ALL THESE INSTRUCTIONS CAN BE FOUND IN A TEXTFILE AFTER THE DOWNLOAD!!!


--After downloading is complete, mount the GTA_Vice_City with DAEMON Tools. It won't show up as a .iso file because it's compressed.

--Run the set-up from here. If the option doesn't pop up, then go into ""My Computer"" and do it manually. You've waited roughly an hour (or at least I did) so you might as well just make sure the option with the radio station is checked. I don't know about any problems without it because I installed it.

--During the installation, it's going to ask you to insert the CD for the radio stations. From here, you unmount the GTA_Vice_City from DAEMON Tools and mount the Vice_City_Play. Don't do anything to any pop ups. Just continue on the installation wizard. The rest of the isntallation should go fine.

--After installation is done, head back to the original folder you downloaded. Find the folder named ""Crack"". Copy this.

--Head into the location where you had the game installed. If you didn't mess with the settings, it should be ""c: > Program Files > Rockstar Games > Grand Theft Auto Vice City""

--After you enter into the folder, go to a clear section and Paste. When the options pop up, Replace or Overwrite the file. Don't keep the other one.

--Create a shortcut from the newly pasted item, and you're all set to play.

Thanks for reading."

Grand Theft Auto: Vice City

""Graphic Corruption Fix""



-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*** Users who DO NOT have this corruption NEED NOT apply this patch ***

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Contents: 



Zip file ""Vicepatch_11.zip"" containing: 



- ViceCity_Patch_11.exe

- ReadmeNOW.txt (this file)



Installation 

--------------



- Unzip file.



- ** OPTIONAL ** make a copy of your original GTA-VC.EXE file (from the directory the you installed Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, for when this issue is fixed with a driver update, and you would like to revert to the original version).



- Start ViceCity_Patch_11.exe. 



- After clicking next twice, browse to your installed Grand Theft Auto: Vice City directory (the directory where GTA-VC.EXE resides) and click next. 



- The patch will check for the presence of the correct GTA-VC.EXE file. If the patch finds an un-modified GTA-VC.EXE, then this file will be updated to version 1.1, otherwise no patching can occur. 



- Click start to begin the update process. 



- After patching click exit. 





The only file changed by this patch is GTA-VC.EXE which is upgraded to version 1.1





Save game and setting files are carried forward with no issues.





This fix is an UN-SUPPORTED update that corrects polygon corruption that has been noticed on certain video cards and PC combinations. 



This is the only change that has been made from your original version of Grand Theft Auto: Vice City.

Uglier than how I remembered it and, looking back, not worthwhile, hah... the only GTA since the third that I hadn't finished, so I got it again out of curiosity, but it's a bad game now. Ugly, sounds are merely passable and you can still have some fun driving but the game's story is ghastly, so it was a bit of a waste of time, but still, I skimmed thru it rather quickly and now it's out of my system."

,Jan_Vat,2012-01-04T21:23Z,"I also get an unhandled exception. Something happens when the game has started - it switches the resolution to something like 640x480, screen goes blank for a sec, then goes back to explorer in low res. I have to push the windows key to get back to the old res, then it says unhandled exception.
I copied over the crack folder and the new .exe is in the directory, run as administrator. Have tried compatibility as XP SP2. Still same result.
Win 7 Home Premium 64.
Any clues guys?"

Just seemed strange to me, as why would it need to access the internet? So I just blocked it. Use with caution."
