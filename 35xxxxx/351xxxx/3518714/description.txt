The concept of the Nour Ensemble's repertoire is based on Persian, Kurdish and Medieval Vocal Music. Supervised by Christophe Rezai, they perform Persian and Kurdish folk melodies, Spanish Cantigas and Gregorian Chants.  Alba has been recorded at the ruins of the 1600 year old Ardeshir Babakan Castle, southern Iran. More info here: http://www.nourensemble.com/

NB: This record is provided in MP3-format and not a loss-less format such as FLAC for a reason: the recording quality of this music is outstanding - and you really, really should buy the CD. These guys are not Britany Spears or 50 Cent. They do not have villas in Bel Air, neither do they drive golden Hummers with spinner rims. They are iranian musicians and they really need your money.
