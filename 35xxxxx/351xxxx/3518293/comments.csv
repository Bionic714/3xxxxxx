,Jamesy2007,2008-04-28T14:54Z,"Digimon is a really good animĂŠ, it is worth downloading. Before I started to dowload this torrent I thougt it would download very slow but it is downloading in 131 kb/s, Thanks qorthevile"
,X-Naut,2008-05-22T07:55Z,This needs some seeds! I wish to relive my childhood lol.
,Pennyforth,2008-06-15T15:28Z,Can a fat man get some seeds?  stuck at 94%.
,darkflare000,2008-07-12T08:23Z,"Stuck at 94.9% Please seed.

If I manage to get 100%, I will never stop seeding.
(not something I do for a lot of the torrents I get.)

I'd really love to be able to just relive my younger years again... This would help me do that! =]"
,Mistro1337,2008-08-05T12:11Z,Also stuck at 94.9% plz seed! I would love to relive one of the best anime shows ever!

,jedigon,2009-01-02T04:33Z,can we seed this please? thanx.
,MagicalT,2009-06-08T23:36Z,"Today for about 10 minutes someone was seeding, i was getting between 250 and 300 kbs.  Whoever that was, THANKYOU SO MUCH! that was the first time someone has been seeding while my computer was on in days.  I would really appreciate it if they would seed for like 30 minutes so I can get the rest though."
,not_a_twitard,2009-06-09T01:39Z,Is there any way I can seed without downloading it first. I really want to help out cuz theres no seeders :(
,MagicalT,2009-06-09T01:46Z,"No, you have to download to seed =/
"
,MagicalT,2009-06-09T02:05Z,"Thanks to whoever is seeding right now, at 76%.
I noticed that they only have it downloaded to 94.8% as well though, like several people were complaining about earlier.  It is now my new mission to find a working torrent for the first season of digimon, hopefully the whole thing.  Ill post it here if I find it."
