The sound is new and refreshing, to hear the ecclectic mix of South Asian harmony with the gritty power of spoken word. Little Empire promises to do what Reggeaton did for Latin music, to bring a new flavour of music to alienated youths.

Some of the music to watch out for include:

*Tough --> A song that establishes that South Asians are not simple people to walk over, it shows the South Asian frustration with people's perception that South Asians are weak.

*Amazon Remix --> A song that features the Tamil songstress Miss. MIA. A nice song to get you in the mood to party.

*Jesus Walks Remix --> So does Allah, Vishnu, ... This song plays on the words of Kanye's song 'Jesus Walks' by stating that all religions walk together for a common interest of humanity, and morality.

*Pain is Power --> This song is dedicated to those lifes lost to the 2004-2005 Tsunami. It is a painful song, that incorporates actual news cast from the incident into the beat ... it is as if the world is crying.

Watch out for these guys, as they do show you how Pain can be Power ... these guys are hungry.
