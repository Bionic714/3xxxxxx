Star Wars Episode III - Recut of the Sith

About 30 minutes of the movie have been removed. Nothing is added.

Recut to get rid of as much of the horrible, horrible dialogue as was possible. I also removed most of the Padme scenes. It makes the movie better. The first edit doesn't happen until after the Chancellor is rescued. Also, I'd get rid of Hayden Christensen if I could. He's such a bad actor.
