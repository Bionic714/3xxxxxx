Watch the real deal, dont validate this loser's lack of a life. Padme is a good character, the dialogue is a necassary part of the story... and lets face it, Natalie Portman is HOTT... which prolly explains why he cut her out. "
[T],Knaster,2006-08-28T15:00Z,Hott and prolly is not a word!
,dmfyrespray,2006-08-30T02:41Z,"Wow nice stuff i cant wait till you recut pulp fiction and put it back together the way it is suppose to be ! .....Also looking forward till the King Kong recut where all the boring scenes where the girl and ape is alone, and the boatride too please..really boring.

you rock!"
,Astralia,2006-08-30T15:57Z,how about you get your fucking ass to school and there learn to make your own movies instead of destroying others....
,testor1138,2006-09-01T05:24Z,"Give retardedpuppy a break already.  ANY CUTTING at all would be an improvement to this  hellhole of a movie. anyone who claims that 
eps 1/2/3 arent a work of enormous crapitude
needs to take their head out of george lucas butt
and look around.

dialog, plot, characters, and casting: they all 
went out the window.

and, what, these movies are sacred? they cant
be touched?   lucas HIMSELF cant keep his gd
hands off the product-- what is it, 3 times? 4?
that he's redone Eps 4/5/6?   he managed to 
improve Ep6, but he needlessly degraded and
eye-candied-up Ep4/5.   Hopefully, he'll get his
busy hands onto Ep 1/2/3 soon--- any retouching
cant hurt those bombs."
,RetardedPuppy,2006-09-01T21:31Z,I guess the people who didn't like this recut won't like my recuts of Episode 1 and 2 then. Those will be up next week.
,RetardedPuppy,2006-09-08T07:59Z,Recut of the Clones is up now if people want to download it. http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3520972/Star_Wars_II_-_Recut_of_the_Clones.avi
,RetardedPuppy,2006-09-08T20:01Z,That link is no good. Here is the proper link to Recut of the Clones. http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3521218/Star_Wars_II_-_Recut_of_the_Clones.avi
,damienfrost,2006-09-30T09:51Z,"Just a quick defense of RetardedPuppy and recuts in general.  I personally think that fanedits are one of the more interesting things that people have found to do with the power of modern software.  Yes, you should definitely watch the original versions first, but there's no harm in checking out someone else's take on how they would have liked it to be.

And for me personally, I would watch The Matrix Dezionized over Reloaded and Revolutions any day!  So go ahead and check out some fanedits, it's not like they are going to cost you anything!"
,JoakimLj,2006-10-03T20:57Z,"Why should I download it, the real ROTS is much better... The dialoges/scenes are there for a puropse!"
