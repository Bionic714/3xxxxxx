Here is the newly released Quest Kodiak Aircraft by Lionhart studios!! I know you can just download it straight from their site...

...but hopefully someone here can crack this? 

I have tried with the DOS based wrapper cracker and Wildmans de-wrapper v3.7 but to no avail! :(  As I don't have v3.81 my only request is that some kind person uploads v3.81 of the de-wrapper and tries to crack the wrapper with that!

Info:

Download package contains:

*9 Seperate model variations of the Quest Kodiak including 3 in Amphibian form
*7 Texture packs with high resolution 32bit format exterior textures
*Authentic and high realism fully functioning Garmin G1000 Avionics system
*6 Fictional Bolivian high detail village scenery sets
*1 Main Kodiak Missionary airbase in Bolivia with 4 hangers and static aircraft
*14 Preset Missions that include detailed HTML mission kiosks with maps and music
*Backup Low Res exterior textures for all 7 texture packs.

Thanks!
