Requests:
1. Yak-40 http://suprunov.valuehost.ru/
2. Captain Sim B757-200 Block B Version 1.2"
,luke97,2006-08-14T07:13Z,"TNX!!!!!! Great release!! I tried to de-wrap the installer yesterday, but seems that all F1 dewrappers are useless.

S!"
,luke97,2006-08-14T07:18Z,"Wait a second.....WTF!! This file is un-cracked!! The 3.81 de-wrapper does not work.
What a useless release xcooby. Very bad."
,scooby321999,2006-08-14T07:22Z,"umm... luke.. i kinda hoped you read my info before you downloaded it.. I did say it was un-cracked!! 

""Here is the newly released Quest Kodiak Aircraft by Lionhart studios!! I know you can just download it straight from their site...

...but hopefully someone here can crack this? 

I have tried with the DOS based wrapper cracker and Wildmans de-wrapper v3.7 but to no avail! :(  As I don't have v3.81 my only request is that some kind person uploads v3.81 of the de-wrapper and tries to crack the wrapper with that!""

I did warn you..."
,luke97,2006-08-14T08:12Z,"Well, 6:00 am here when I saw the release....but how can I imagine someone will upload something you can download directly from the companyÂ´s site? :-(

Also, 3.81 does not work and it is avaliable on emule.   I repeat. Very bad."
,belga1,2006-08-14T09:06Z,"Thank you very much Scooby.It's not bad at all...already seen ppls who post freewares!!
Bad it's the no crack available.Don't ask me to crack..I'm only here for bashing..flaming..download..and few time tell thank you."
,PHBFO,2006-08-14T09:11Z,"Thanks!
Req: Captainsim New update & PSPanels 737NG"
,scooby321999,2006-08-14T09:28Z,"Luke i realise the idiocy of uplaoding something that you can get a direct download from but:

1. I posted it here to get attention to the great TPB FS community so that someone with the right knowledge will be able to crack it..

2. I could have just uploaded a blank text file but I bet more people would have flamed me for doing so.."
,scooby321999,2006-08-14T09:28Z,"3. It takes the load of the main servers and spreads the product farther, also it is possible to get higher speeds this way if the main servers at LionHart were congested due to a bunch of other people trying to download the profuct..

In any case.. I am dissapointed that v3.81 did not work..

However seeing as to how I don't have (or like) eMule and it is less than 2mb, could you upload v3.81 of wildmans de-wrapper??"
,luke97,2006-08-14T09:36Z,"Check your PM. I uploaded it for you.
S!"
,scooby321999,2006-08-14T09:58Z,Thanks very much! Check your PM too!
