This contains two live concerts from November 1996 and April 28th 1997 respectively.

Recorded originally by Radio 1, this 2 CD set captures the extremely exciting Kenickie live experience, complete with bum notes and banter from the ladies Laverne, Du Santiago and Montrose.

Also bundled as extras are two live studio sessions, recorded for Stuart Maconie and Mark Radcliffe, the latter in the final week of the much-missed Graveyard Shift. This is not a transcore, stream rip or bootleg (so please take this into note o beautiful Oink mods before going snip ban crazy). Just quality live music performed by shouty glam 19 year olds.
