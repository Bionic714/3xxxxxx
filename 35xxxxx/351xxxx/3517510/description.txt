Putumayo Presents:
Romantica 1998
I really love this CD. The melodies are exotic and warm and stay with you long after the CD is finished playing. Beautiful, melodic songs with an ecclectic mix of flavors all throughout. Great CD!

Love stories abound in the literature and art of cultures dating back to ancient times: from the Chinese (represented by the still popular Blue Willow dishware pattern) to indigenous American tribes whose stories are told in parable and carving, to the Western world's current infatuation with soap operas, romance novels, and even Top 40 radio. Putumayo's Romantica presents an appealing alternative to the airwaves' fast-food diet of "oh baby, baby" with a collection of music that sounds more colorfully genuine, rooted in the age-old tradition of courtship common to all cultures. Scotland's favorite son Dougie MacLean contributes a traditional hopeful ballad, "She Will Find Me," and Louise Taylor's sweetly eccentric intonation is set off beautifully by rousing hand drums on the standout "Your Face." American Toshi Reagan's "Love and Affection" is spirited, sultry, gospel-tinged R&B, while a loose and lighthearted Marley-esque take on a reggae tune of the same name is performed to great effect by African popster Majek Fashek.
