,farsan H,2006-08-07T16:17Z,Missed the race this weekend....please seed!!
,Messerschmitt,2006-08-07T16:41Z,"It is seeding, but I have to upload 1.36 GB with my limited bandwith so you have to have patience. 
I am very happy to share this amaizing race covered 100% with the community but also, this is not my computer so there 'might' be some periods when I cannot be available. 
I can promise you I will try to be here as much as possible but please bear with me."
,farsan H,2006-08-07T16:48Z,k...thanks for the release man :-)
,DOS4GW,2006-08-07T19:36Z,"Thanks for the release.

Fold Em: Try overnet/donkey. I got all most races since '94 of it."
,Messerschmitt,2006-08-07T20:46Z,"The interesting aspect is that I have uploaded more than half (756mb) and yet there is only 22% availability instead of about 40-50% and there are plenty of peers available so the already uped pieces  to be available. 
I'm not a torrent expert so I cannot judge this statistic. 
Anyway very soon I will be unavailable for several hours but I will be back as soon as I can."

,DOS4GW,2006-08-08T10:42Z,Messerschmitt: Set yourself as superseeder! I told you in a private message.
,Fold Em,2006-08-08T15:23Z,"videoman.
Thank you very much for the link. I wrote them an E-mail because i didnt get  the languish ;) 
DOS4GW.  What is overnet/donkey? I did a google search and found something about downloading in german languish. Is there an English version? Im not an expert when it comes to downloading and torrents. Thank you very much for the effort. "
,Messerschmitt,2006-08-08T15:50Z,"Fold Em those are peer 2 peer programs which mean you will connect directly to a user and download. I never heard about overnet tho.

DOS, Yea I did set myself to initial-seeder from the beggining. Oh and I have no idea where to find the private messages. They are not in Preface option"
,Fold Em,2006-08-08T23:35Z,"Messer.This should display in preferences if you have a message in your inbox:. 1 message(s). Unread: 1. Its below the ""save"" button.
I cant figuer out how to get it started? How do i search for formula 1 at overnet? Could someone put out a direct link to ""download this torrent"" I would highly aprisiate it. Take care and THX"
,Popeye666,2006-08-09T20:44Z,"Well , now iÂ´m seeding anyway...........finally"
,Fold Em,2006-08-30T17:23Z,"Budapest was the best race so far this season. Enyone who's going to put up the Turkish Grand Prix? I cant find it.
