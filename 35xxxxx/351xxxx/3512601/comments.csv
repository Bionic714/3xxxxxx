,k-t-m,2006-08-15T18:21Z,"no hoax. http://www.themovieblog.com/archives/2006/08/snakes_on_a_train_yes_you_read_that_right.html -- snakes are hatched inside a young woman, slowly devouring her from within. Her only chance for survival is a powerful shaman who lives across the border. With only hours to live, she jumps on a train headed for Los Angeles. Unfortunately for the passengers aboard, they are now trapped, soon to be victims of these flesh-eating vipers."
,grantweiler,2006-08-15T21:33Z,This is actually true.  Its a fanboy effort that was created on the back of the Samuel L Jackson movie.  Sounds terrible though.
