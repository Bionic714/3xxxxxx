,BirdEyes,2007-10-21T21:37Z,Cheers for this
,nathismus,2009-04-01T14:57Z,"Thank you for this, it works perfectly and is just what I need. Saved pounds on a class I could not afford. : )"
,icedbabe24,2009-05-10T04:25Z,"the quality of this torrent is excellent!! i highly recommend it. my ONLY problem is that the workout is too fast pace, the makers should have taken more time to let you feel the stretch. before you know it the workout has ended and youre left feeling a little cheated. but perhaps running through it twice will help you! overall i give it a thumbs up!"
,gabrielilla,2010-03-04T23:26Z,"Thanks so much for the video. At first I had problems watching the video. The audio worked but there where was no video. My Windows Media Player didn't read avi files. So, to the people that have the same problem. I downloaded a code and now it works fine. 

Here's the link...

,mister_v,2011-09-09T22:04Z,Thank you for this. I plan to plonk all the file into a VLC playlist so they play one after the other. Cheerio old beans.
