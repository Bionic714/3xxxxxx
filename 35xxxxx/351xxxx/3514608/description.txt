brink of war. The Russian serfs are in revolt; Germany?s industries are
building an ominous war machine; the porcelain surface of the Austro
Hungarian Empire is beginning to crack; and the Balkan States are tearing
at the fabric of the disintegrating Ottoman Empire.
Into this tense, volatile mix roars the fabled Orient Express, the epitome of
luxury, power, and decadence, crossing Europe from Paris to Constantinople.
With all of Europe ready to explode, this train could literally be The Last
Express.
You are Robert Cath, a young American doctor, who receives a strange,
urgent request from your old friend, Tyler Whitney, to join him on the
Orient Express. As soon as you step onto this opulent train, you are plunged
into a maelstrom of treachery, romance, and political intrigue. You?ll need to
think fast and act faster to unravel the secrets of The Last Express.
