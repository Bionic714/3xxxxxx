,S010,2008-02-02T13:01Z,"I've been looking for this for years.. Many thanks!!
Will seed promise..."
,raveyz,2008-02-17T20:12Z,Please can a few more people seed this for the next 12 hours or so? I'd love to have this done soon...
,Katana314,2008-02-24T01:48Z,Anyone else getting a problem reading one of the files when going to CD 2? It might be the fact that I'm using DOSbox.
,mcfelix,2008-05-11T16:00Z,"so.. there's a Mac version and a Windows version in this torrent..? If so, anyone tried the mac version under Classic or Rosetta?"
,mcfelix,2008-05-11T16:01Z,"I meant SheepShaver, not Rosetta, lol"
,Mikes86,2008-08-08T00:01Z,"Hey guys can anyone please tell me where can I find a crack for this because it asks me for the disc.
I searched at megagames and gamecopyworld but couldnt find one. Many thanks"
,WogerWabbit,2009-07-29T16:16Z,"Yes, thanks for this! 

But cannot get it working with Boxer on Mac due to it needing CD!

Any no-cd cracks or work arounds for this? "
,nsc007,2009-11-13T22:20Z,"Seriously, could you people seed this when you're done, I don't like downloading at 1 KB/s"
,WogerWabbit,2010-02-19T17:41Z,"Any Mac users wanting to use Boxey, follow these instructions: 

1) Mount the 1st ISO as a DOS disc (will need Toast or something that does the same)
2) Run Boxey, point it to the mounted disc.
3) Mount the 1st ISO as a Mac disc (just alt-click on the iso)
4) Copy HD.HPF to your Boxey/Express1 package (alt-click on the package->Show Package Contents...)
5) Move all the files of Boxey/Express/Express up one level (so they are in the root of the package).
6) Run the package.

Full screen colors were munged here (Boxey 0.85) but the game plays fine otherwise.

For the other discs, you'll need to mount them as DOS discs as you did the first one."
,avenger2690,2010-10-14T02:23Z,Thank you so much for uploading this! Could we get some more seeders on this though? I'd really appreciate it. =)
,Advize,2011-01-29T18:52Z,"Why is this torrent 1.88GB when the game takes up 35mb? Also, why is there 3 iso's included in this and what are the differences between them?"
,chrispm84,2011-09-02T14:15Z,"@Advize:

I know you're probably too young to understand or remember this, but here's why it's so big. People who are wondering about a no disc crack, you should read this, too. Back when I was a kid in the 90s, we didn't have super fast HDDs. In fact, the cd-rom drives were MUCH faster than a HDD, so running the files from the HDD would have been much slower than from the cd. So, in those times, all games ran from the disc while only some things were placed on the HDD. Now, I haven't tried this on this game, as I haven't played it or finished downloading it, yet, but I know on some of the games made in this time period, you could just copy all the files from each disc and run it from the HDD. No promises it will work, but it might. You may have to change some registry strings to make the game point in the right direction, though. Again, I'm not sure, as I haven't tried yet. You can try if unmounting the disc is that important to you. "
,chrispm84,2011-09-02T14:20Z,"Lol, oops... I need to sleep. I just read that over and realized that I fucked up what I was trying to say. It's not that they were faster, it's that cd-roms were fast enough to do what the games needed to do. Putting them on a faster than cd-rom HDD wouldn't have given many if any games a performance boost and would only increase the installation time. So, only files that were needed to be quickly loaded into ram were put on the HDD. Everything else was just streamed from the disc. Sorry if I confused anybody, lol."
,pabolton,2012-01-26T00:20Z,"couldnt install, prob bcuz im on win 7...disc one would come up but once instal is pressed nothing happens"
,xhizors,2012-06-04T16:21Z,@Advize: Because most of us only had 200MB harddrives... DERP.
