,_Whoopy_,2007-03-08T17:20Z,"ty, atleast that is a positive comment :)"
,mozo1,2007-06-08T04:18Z,"The recent NOD32 haven't found any virus.
And I DL keygens via torrent because almost each google hit contains viruses. Sure, I could found a one without, but it usually takes more than a hour.
And why a torrent for this small file: Other good things about torrents will still work: If t contains virus, nobody will seed, if it isn't, there will be a lot of seeds. And don't forget, this feedback too.
This is not like a keyword-flooded page where anybody can set a trap, and no feedback, or any reaction if sby step into it.

SO NOT VIRUS, ANYBODY WHO WOULD HAVE FOUND A ONE COULD HAVE WRITTEN HERE!

Who aggre, seed plz, who don't, post here the virus's name, and the scanner's url and version to let us find it! If you say virus witout these, that's like: watch, there is santa there! (And everybody watch it... :|)"
,Jonahtan,2007-08-23T17:56Z,TY ! Just what i needed :D. It works fine guys! So say sorry yes!
,7vegeta7,2008-03-01T14:57Z,"This is no virus i promise...BTW thanks Whoopy!!
i really needed  this big thanks to yah! =)"
,iMuffin,2008-03-28T07:32Z,"McAfee didn't detect a virus, ran fine, worked so far, haven't tried bnet, but other than that, great find whoopy!"
,DrPoppe,2008-04-06T11:36Z,Can you play on bnet with these keys?
,filecore,2008-04-29T20:42Z,"@DrPoppe and others

Of course you can't play on battle.net with this. That's because game servers always, always, always check for valid serials, and since you're STEALING this game without paying for a valid, unique serial, of course you can't play online (unless you're running a cracked server yourself). You can't expect to steal stuff and then walk up to the owner and demand he use his guarantee on the stolen goods because you'd like full service! Fucking moron."
,LastShinobi,2008-06-15T23:09Z,can i go online with this?
,bob1202,2008-07-04T19:52Z,"yes, but only on private servers like eurobattle.net"
,Foustace,2008-08-28T12:31Z,Does this work on bnet at all?
,uzi8,2008-09-18T19:11Z,"No it doesnt work on b.net, as far as i know there is no other way to play on b.net than buying the game.
But you can go to a private server like eurobattle.net"
,Mikeross3,2009-04-05T08:20Z,"Ok look. I was nervous to click download. I promise, this is a working keygen, no virus.  I was very realived and got my frozen throne. Thanks Whoopy, sorry for doubting you!!"
,shoozer,2009-06-14T00:43Z,thanks for the torrent!  much appreciated
,stickelmo,2009-07-10T11:38Z,There is no virus  i just downloaded it and I'm fine. Ran it... i got a key :D
,ddr_master,2009-07-23T05:56Z,"I downloaded it just fine, I scanned it with Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware, ESET NOD32, and I even had my Comodo stuff tell me it was fine, so don't listen to these fucktards that don't know what they are talking about. If YOU haven't personally tested the shit, DON'T FUCKING SAY IT HAS A VIRUS! Fucking stupid asses."
,jaybonline,2009-08-20T17:35Z,it doesn't have viruses... i scanned it using bitdefender anti-virus... it's the best anti-virus when it comes to detecting viruses....
,scozzie,2011-05-19T12:23Z,worked perfect ty
