,carltonpalmer,2006-08-07T17:09Z,Just wondered why this emulator with 6000 games is 400 mb and why a recent C64 emulator on here with 2000 games was 1.1 gb. Makes me a tad suspicious.

,Knyte6426,2008-05-12T19:40Z,"To Kirby:

IIRC, Aztec challenge used PORT 1, instead of PORT 2 for the jostick, so try swapping those under the options."

Anyone know where we can get a good copy.?"
,zeratul3,2009-03-07T03:31Z,"Endrina and kirby -

Since this was my first computer, I immediately downloaded this torrent as soon as I saw it.  I use the VICE emulator to play the games, and I too had trouble finding out how to use the controller.  Fortunately, after playing around with the program (VICE) for a bit, I figured it out :)

Open up the emulator and go to Settings > Joystick settings.  Then on the pop-up window, click ""Config Keyset A"" (Or B, your choice).  Map out the keys you would like to use, then click OK.  Under the drop-down list for ""Joystick in port #1"" select ""Keyset A"" and click okay.  

And you're done :)

However, I'm still working on how to save these settings...just poke around the program for a bit.  By the way kirby, Aztec Challenge was one my favorite games too, along with Beamrider.
