After receiving hundreds of cards and letters from parents and teachers telling us how much children love dancing, singing, and listening to Putumayo CDs, we are pleased to release our first kid's CD. World Playground: A Musical Adventure for Kids is a collection of great songs from around the world that the family can enjoy together. This CD takes children and parents on a musical journey to faraway places where they can be introduced to other people and places around the world. A trip to the World Playground makes exploring other cultures a fun adventure for music fans of all ages.
