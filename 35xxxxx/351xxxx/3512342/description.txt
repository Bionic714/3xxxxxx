Game Notes :

"This is the second Discworld game.

What do you mean,┬┤I haven┬┤t finished the first one yet?┬┤

Good grief,some people...look,give the prunes to the fishmonger,get the
dragon to breathe on the mirror,throw the Black Monk to the crocodiles and
shoot the dragon with the other dragon.

Done that? Good. Now, if everyone┬┤s caught up...

Ahem.

This is the second Discworld* game. Death has gone missing. A hero is needed
to bring him back. But there┬┤s only Rincewind, incompetent wizard and
higly-trained coward. You won┬┤t catch Rincewind running away. He┬┤s too
fast.

Unfortunately, he┬┤s all there is that stands between people and the horrible
prospect of immortality. No one wants that , do they ?

We┬┤ve made DW2 a little easier (snigger), with lots of new locations and even
prettier graphics and sounds.

As Death himself says: HAVE FUN."

* A magic world which goes through space on the back of a turtle,
  as everyone should know by now!
