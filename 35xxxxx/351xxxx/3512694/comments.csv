,mongpa,2009-05-01T05:58Z,"Please include English subtitles next time. Each subtitle is only a couple of MB, so it's false economy not including as many as possible. They are important for people who don't hear too well and for people who read English better than they hear it. If more people (with different languages) want the movie, more people will seed it."
