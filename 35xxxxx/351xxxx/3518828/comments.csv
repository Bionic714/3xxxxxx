secondly, thats only the good ones. i'd be surprised if that comprised half of all downloaders. 
basically what i'm saying is take some pride in your release. don't even bother if you're not going to seed it properly, and by properly i mean at least 5:1 if not more. otherwise you're just wasting everyones time with a release thats going to die out early on. if you're not going to invest some time and love into seeding then don't bother, you're not doing anyone any favors by being selfish and stingy about it. 
all that being said, thanks for the release, i'll try and seed to 2:1 like you've asked, but i'm only downloading three of the albums."

Every upload from him (and there's a lot) is a fake! Don't download anything from him"
