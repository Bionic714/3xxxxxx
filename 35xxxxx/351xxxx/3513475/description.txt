VitoriaMario was a chaotic network of people in Brazil using this same avatar in the early beggining of this millenium.
(S)He worked a lot with cut and paste, detournment and a tactic of "confusing discourses with overloaded information".
Maybe just an "immature" Nihilistic project but that generated some interesting actions, most of them not well documented and that now belogs to orality and symptomatic relationships that it helped to build.

This 4 videos are just a homage to this network, and they just mean that you're now part of it.
