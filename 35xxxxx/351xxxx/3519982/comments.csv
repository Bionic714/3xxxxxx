,matrix_wc,2006-09-06T05:01Z,"It looks like this torrent is looking for inferno.demonoid, not TPB. I think the torrent needs to be re-created. "
,Matias21,2006-09-06T15:01Z,I think that this torrent would need seeds first and then public torrent in demonoid
,husk666,2006-09-08T23:28Z,j채vla fegisar!!!!
,Virgil0211,2006-09-10T03:37Z,This torrent SERIOUSLY needs some more seeders.
,awemaker,2006-09-17T06:39Z,"There are 75 of us stuck at 20% & are still holding on for a heroic seed for a couple of hours.  Is this you????   Just do it.

Thanks!"
,Jamirotauro,2006-09-17T15:08Z,"Matias21....Why post if you are not going to seed?

This is a cruel joke, a legendary torrent that never was...Your chance of giving back to the community that has given you so much i s fading away...SEED at least to completion 1 , Ill seed for a week this..I promise"
,Jamirotauro,2006-09-20T15:13Z,"You know...If you are thinking about downloading this ...Forget it..You ll have the fastest 20% you have ever downloaded then you will be stuck like the 106 guys here...

This was potentially one of the best torrents ever...."
,TechStud,2006-09-26T01:32Z,20% and holding.  Been two weeks now...  Some day hopefully.
,happyclamper,2006-09-29T09:41Z,"20 percent and waiting ... waiting ... waiting for more.  Where, Oh where, has the little bastard seed gone?"
,Daddy_Spank,2006-10-09T09:01Z,PLEASE SOMEONE WITH THIS TORRENT SEED... THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE STUCK AT 20.2 % FOR A VERY VERY LONG TIME. I AM BEGGING YOU......
,happyclamper,2006-10-15T04:00Z,Now there is some joker out there running Shareaza 2.2.1.0@62.1.164.215 giving out bogus blocks!  What a putz.
[V],beileveld,2006-10-16T22:30Z,Seed!!
[V],beileveld,2006-10-16T22:32Z,"The torrent has not been properly made. Between the tracker URL's, you need to put an empty line.

However, with DHT working, you can still find seeds."
,djurgarden1,2007-01-19T01:53Z,Why can't you give us the hole thing? I want this so badly.
,irishdunn,2007-02-04T18:08Z,"I have been running this thing for 5 days, when is it going to get a solid seed?"
,munk55,2007-02-18T11:43Z,Kan n책gon seeda eller....laddat ner 20% och sen d책???????????????????????

,EgoPhone,2007-02-27T07:26Z,"There is hope I have some Sting and I will try to start a new torrent. Never done it before. Quality is mixed. 96Kbps to 196Kbps

Will post when its ready."
,Georgebrooks_3,2008-04-02T16:16Z,"NO SEEDERS! COME ON PEOPLE, PLEASE SEED!!!"
,Borzth,2008-07-22T09:52Z,"Seed... if i may pleas.... :D
