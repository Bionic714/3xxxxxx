,Lurest,2007-02-12T14:44Z,"From the past? Well i wasn't born tomorrow. That crackfix u refer to leaves and error msg saying, missing blabla resource 001 something. Any tip on what's needed to do here?"
,Lurest,2007-02-12T15:30Z,"LoL, nvm my noobishness, i figured it out. And i am a noob, so it should be failry easy to get up and running for anyone. All u need to do is:

1. Mount the RUNAWAY_CD1.mds file with Daemon Tools (just google the program if u dont have it, its freeware, easy to find and very easy to use).

2. Start the installation by clicking the autorun.exe file. U will find this by exploring ur new disc drive that has automatically been created by Daemon Tools. During installation u will be asked to switch to cd.2 and later to cd.3. Just hit the windows button and mount the next mds file with Daemon Tools.

3. After installation is complete u will be asked to restart ur computer. Once this is done explore the runaway cd drive again, open the crack-fixes folder then the crack2_nocd folder. Copy the runaway.exe file from there to the folder in which u have installed the game.

4. Click the copied runaway.exe file to start the game. It should now run perfectly with full sound, speech and cutscenes. And no cd-key is required.

This is a truly great traditional 3rd person Point&Click adventure game. Strongly recommended for fans of The Monkey Island series, the Discworld series(the games ofc) and similar games. This game has helped this genre of games to bloom again, with 600.000+ copies sold in Europe alone. Have fun adventurers:)"
,Logan X,2007-05-14T20:13Z,"for me the animations keep repeating in an endless loop,  tried all cracks from www.gamecopyworld.com

any ideas thanks?"
,ahfangs,2007-09-27T06:32Z,"I'm having the same problem as Logan X. During the intro, after the guy talks about his story, the animation sequence runs once, there is a slight rewind sound, and it starts looping non-stop. Theres no way to start the game."
,banessi,2007-12-16T16:10Z,"I've had a same problem as everyone, game crashes in the middle of an intro. I tried to copy a game save and still the same problem happens. Solution is to download ACE mega codec pack (42mb ) and install a Truemotion 2.0 Codec (you must do this manually in the configuration meny of the
program during installation). Just check all of true codec boxes (there are 3 or 4)and play the game. Worked for me and my cracked version of the game. Try unninstalling any previus codec pacs. Just for precaution . Ofcourse you'll need to download crack.exe to bypass starforce"
,BabelonKing,2008-07-21T03:24Z,"The image file seems to be corrupted for me. When I mounted CD1 to Daemon Tools, nothing happened, so I decided to extract all files from the images in there own folder (exactly named after the images themselves, i.e RUNAWAY_CD1, CD2, CD3). During installation, it asks for CD2 after using CD1, so I browsed through my folders to RUNAWAY_CD2, it continued installation until asking for CD3, then mounted CD3. With the game completely installed, I rebooted and overwritten the original .exe with the crack from the 1st folder, then started the game, but nothing happened except that I can see the loading icon (cd image) in the bottom-left corner of the screen for a few seconds. How the hell did everyone else get this game working properly, with limited to no readme/instructions available in the mix, it's mindboggling to figure out how to exactly make the game operate."

,thewatchmaker,2009-04-24T11:00Z,"i have downloaded this torrent a couple of times and messed about with it but could not get it working until i followed banessi's post on downloading the ace mega codex pack. and yes, success. thanks banessi. the codex pack looks cool as well (so far)."
