,WiiFisher,2006-08-30T10:05Z,Self-righteous wench forgets one of her own Bible's lessons: People Who Live In Glass Houses Should Not Throw Stones.  But then all the religeous right-wingers think they know what's right for everybody else and do their damnedest to force it upon the rest of us.  I just can't wait until they get to face their God and see just how evil they have been.  I soooooo wanna be there when DUHbya gets his comeuppance.......
,macrossroads,2006-09-03T20:08Z,"Self-righteous wench? Better that than a self serving bitch like far left winger Hillary don?t you think? Never mind, I just answered my own question...

,Shut_Me_Up,2007-05-09T14:59Z,"Hillary Clinton is NOT on the far left, you moron. 
Ann Coulter is a hateful bitch. The fact that Clinton is a piece of shit really doesn't change that."
,OzPhantom,2007-06-25T01:17Z,"Oh Hillary is definitely on the Far Left and is only posturing for the sake of the general election. 
Everyone is controversial in some way or another. So taking that into account, I think Ann Coulter is great. Leftists miss when she is joking and being sarcastic. They not only have no sense of humor, but they have alot of hatred to make up for it."
,tshipp,2008-09-16T05:02Z,"Wow, maybe you should remember that ""people in glass houses"" is not in the bible. But then all the self-righteous left-wingers think they know whats right for everybody else and do their damnedest to force it upon the rest of us. I just can't wait until they get to face our God and see just how evil they have been. I soooooo wanna be around when people stop bitching about our president......."

,torgman1,2009-01-21T03:17Z,"OzPhantom & tshipp : ROTFL

BTW, tshipp, they stopped bitching about our president today :D"
,Aeronomer,2009-04-18T01:40Z,The fact that she drives all you fucktard crazy is why I love her. LOL
,Aeronomer,2009-04-18T01:42Z,"P.S. The only way you could think Hilary is NOT the far left after she admits to being an old school ""progressive"" (read collectivist) is if you're a left-wing whack job yourself. "
