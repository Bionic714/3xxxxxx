A Cocorosie album from 2004.
Try this one if you want some melancholy indie music with a very characteristic voice of the singer. Chanses are good you will like this if you enjoy bands like Anthony and the Johnsons.

I'm aware there's already a torrent of this album up. This is not a reseed since this seems to be another release.
