When Nate?s irresponsibility finally catches up with him, Bob and Margo force him to get job at a local theme restaurant where the food is served up ?fresh from the Bawbie.? Being pulled into this new world has its benefits when he decides to move past Amber and takes a cute coworker on a double date with Dove. Meanwhile Bob and Margo try to find creative ways to enhance their love life and search for inspiration. Nate?s first date back home starts and ends in typical Mark Dove fashion when Dove arrives with his Aunt Louise and the foursome are forced to spend an awkward evening together.
