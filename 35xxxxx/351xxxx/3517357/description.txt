COWBOY BEBOP (Kaub√¥i Bibappu)

--------------------------------

Spike Spiegel is a bounty hunter in the far future with an easy going attitude and some deadly skill at martial arts. Together with his partners, Jet Black, and later Faye Valentine as well, they go to job to job across the galaxy looking for the high priced fugitives to bag. Along the way, the bad guys are in for a load of hurt and frustration from these characters.

Summary written by Kenneth Chisholm {kchishol@execulink.com}

In the year 2071, the Solar System is linked by a network of hyperspace gateways. Police lose their grasp on crime and a bounty hunting system has been implemented. On an old fishing starship called the "Bebop," a cool as Zen man of mystery, a macho former hard-boiled cop, a brash and fickle woman with a large debt, a whimsical whiz kid hacker and an unsuspecting Welsh Corgi band together to hunt bounty heads for a meager living. Unfortunately, they are some of the unluckiest people in the star system. These are the stories of the adventurous (and misadventurous) lives of four struggling people and a dog.

OGM-files, dvd-rip quality and dual audio(English and Japanese).

I use codecs from ACE Mega Codec Pack and Media Player Classic to view these files. Media Player Classic is included in the ACE Mega-pack. To change audio in Media Player Classic, just open the file and pause the clip. Right-click anywhere in the window, and under "Audio" you'll see the two audio streams. Just choose whichever you prefer.
