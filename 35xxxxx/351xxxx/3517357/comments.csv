,thehooly,2006-09-11T00:59Z,Does this copy have subtitle errors in some episodes?
,Ethra,2006-09-12T21:48Z,"Don't think so, but I don't give the subs that much attention... But downloaded 88 times and no-one has complained, so I don't think so."
,Hellfish117,2006-12-26T00:22Z,Someone with good connection seed plz. It says it's 2 days left untill finished dling :S
,Ethra,2007-01-14T06:03Z,"Thank you all for helping me seed this, I will not be seeding this torrent any longer. I hope someone can find it in their heart to take over this torrent and keep it well-seeded. But no torrent of mine will ever die, so if we suddenly run out of seeders, I will start seeding again by demand. Just send a message. I need space and bandwidth for new torrents =)"
,boringmike,2007-01-20T11:43Z,"please seed someone, i need it very much!

,Ethra,2007-05-12T18:52Z,"Seeding for a few weeks again, I hope at least some of you will help me seed this so I can focus on new releases."
,Herforder_Pils,2007-06-25T17:18Z,"How is this going to work eg. when I play the files with the Media Player?
Am I going to hear pure English Audio or pure Japanese Audio or he two at the same time (which I experianced of most ""Dual Audio"" torrents)?
If yes, which programm can play only the English or only the Japanese Audio?
Media Player 10, DivX 6 and PowerDVD 7 play both Audio files simultaneously *damn*

I'd like to download and seed as well but I need some further info before starting ;)"
,Ethra,2007-06-26T08:09Z,"I use Media Player Classic, which comes with the Ace Mega Codec pack, amongst others. I suppose VLC would work as well =)"
,evergreen82,2007-06-26T19:56Z,"This Animation is the best one ever. I'm seeding. It is in perfect quality, and works just fine. Enjoy"
,Aynatix,2007-06-28T13:03Z,Seed please.
,Ethra,2007-07-04T02:05Z,"""Seed please""? Are you fricking retarded? One more comment like that, and I kill this torrent! Upgrade your line and stop whining, I've uploaded OVER 2500GB of this torrent, and I'm seeding it at a steady 1-3.5MB/s! "
,Ethra,2007-07-04T02:12Z,"I've uploaded, and to be precise since I started the torrent, 2982GB of this torrent! And I'm still seeding! If anyone of you doesn't get enough speed, blame someone else. I have a 100/100Mbit line that I pay for, and I do it for free. Complain to someone who gives a crap."
,Yersmoky,2007-07-13T19:06Z,"THANK YOU!!:D,I don't know why,But every time I've looked for a FULL set of ENGLISH epsiodes I'd get notta,Untill today:D,As soon as this gets downloaded  I will become a regular seeder of this amazing series:D,Thanks for sharing:D"
,Ethra,2007-07-20T23:42Z,"You're welcome, glad you like it =) 
If you have any problems with the Dual Audio, I'll help you out as best I can =)"
,YinXao,2007-08-28T20:10Z,"I appreciate the up, but I gotta say, it's annoying that the ""scene"" that made these sticks their logo in the beginning of each ep. for a full minute or so. It's just really unnecessary. I'm actually tempted to check out other dual audio sets, or the ""uncensored"" ones. But thanks anyways, it is good quality. "
,Ethra,2007-08-30T23:56Z,"Well, I gotta say you're one lazy fucker. Enjoy the 1-minute intro(which takes 1 sec to click by), or just download some other realease. This is the best tho, so best of luck to you, poor thing."
,leeper,2007-09-01T00:21Z,"thank you so much for seeding DVD quality of cowboy bebop; this is one of those shows where the top-notch music and animation go so hand in hand with each other that anything but the highest quality  rip spoils the experience.  one downside is that it means downloading over 5 GB's, and that you have almost singlehandedly (over 3000GB's uploaded?! jesus dear fucking christ...) kept this torrent alive.  

Only seen this before on Adult Swim, watched every episode in English several times.  Will be very interesting to watch in the original Japanese as it works with the Kanno score and Watanabe's original direction, word."

,Cowboy_F,2007-10-13T03:26Z,"I appreciate the people seeding, for some reason I think i'm connected to a few people but only one of them is properly seeding (at an astonishing rate of ~1.5kb/s). It'll take over a month to complete, come on guys. Seed this. "

,ppierce,2008-02-26T13:18Z,"This collection does not include Session 10.

Session 10 in this torrent is just a copy of Session 8. You will need to find EP10 elsewhere."
,ppierce,2008-02-26T13:21Z,"Correction, that was just an OGM error, whereby some files do not load cleanly in VLC and thus requires a restart.

EP 10 *is* in the torrent."
,aurturia,2008-02-27T02:18Z,Can somebody show the less-than-tech-savy how to switch between dubs and subs? thanx.
,ep591189,2008-02-29T06:34Z,Took forever to download but finally complete.  Quality is 10/10.  You are awesome Ethra.  As promised I will keep seeding this for a month or two.  Thanks

,purpletouch,2008-03-23T20:55Z,"i jus wana share what i came across to on the net..if you want this torrent jus in english without the subs dl these xvid, ogg splitter,cole2k codec... but that only works with wmp 9 or higher well i can't picture anyone here using a version of wmp that's older than ver. 9 "
,purpletouch,2008-03-24T04:15Z,"here's a better way of playing this file in english than what i said before DL this codec
http://www.brothersoft.com/the-codecs-62817.html
then on your desktop taskbar you'll see the ffdshow icon right click on that pick... switcher-in-place then the morgan... will show up pick audio 1...well usually as soon as you install this on your comp its already set to english audio"
,nedep,2008-03-28T20:33Z,"Hey yo, anyone who can tell me; to which format i shall convert the OGM-file to, to maintain the audio... its because i want to burn the files down on a DVD, so i will be able to watch the episodes on my DVD-player... but when i convert the files, they lose thier audio... (ogm cant be burned down as a video format)
i would really appreciate some help :) thx"
,jaysinz1,2008-05-26T01:54Z,"be easy on me im still learning. i finished download and got some weird spanish guy talking over all the audio, anyone els get that? im gonna try again, can anyone tell me how to change over audio?"

,Alannah,2008-07-21T09:18Z,"Anybody know the resolution of the episodes? Looking at the comments I can tell its high quality, but just how high?"
,Deesotilio,2008-07-27T15:59Z,Nice on the upload. Just started it and I'm getting a pretty decent bitrate. I'll seed this one up to at least 3-4 :P
,sweatersdc,2008-08-21T21:22Z,"Good audio and video quality, but there are REALLY annoying watermark tags. At one point, in the middle of one of the episodes (not in the intro or credits or anything), a tag comes up that says ""If this is not an OGM file then it has been stolen by lamers."" Are you joking? That's like giving someone a gift but writing your name all over it with a Sharpie. Grow up.

And by the way, anyone who is having trouble converting this file from OGM to a more compatible file, use a program called ""AlltoAVI"". I know next to nothing about video conversion and that program enabled me to watch these episodes on my 360 in basically no time at all.

Thanks for the upload and seed, but again, those watermarks are annoying. Think I'll just buy the DVD so I can watch it without ""commercial interruptions."""
,LeDomo,2008-08-22T02:42Z,"I'd like to say Thanks Ethra.. for just uploading this torrent i don't care if the quality is good I just need Cowboy Bebop.. My average download speed is 20kb/s I'm uploading 100kb/s Just got to 6 percent.. I'd like to get it done fast cause my home connections sucks ass.. and i only download at .3kb/s(At a hotel right now).. Also, if you have a crappy ass connection like me. Its not the seeders fault just get better internet. And Im not gonna say, ""PLEEEASE SEED."" But. i could use it... My hardrive is already blown to shit from downloading Japanese Audio versions. I finally found one that I hope you can convert to English.. As long as my computer is on I will be uploading this, there is no reason why someone should miss out on a wonderful series such as, Cowboy Bebop... Mr.Pants@gmail.com if ya wanna contact me. Thanks again for the upload."

,LeDomo,2008-08-23T06:52Z,"Okay, couple questions.. being fairly new to Torrents. I downloaded the Codecs, from Brothersoft.com that Purpletouch suggested.. I play one of the sessions specificly Session 01. I get past maybe a minute and the sound justs cuts out. I converted it from OGM to AVI. Useing OGMtoAVI. Is there a program that you would seriously suggest? I'm going to download Media Player Classic and see what i can do. AT 59% right now thanks for all the seeds.. Im seeding at full power. So right now im experimenting with Session 01. On how to conver the rest of the files. From OGM to AVI or any other one that will work."

Haha, then by your logic we should complain to you as you obviously give a crap.
Calm your tits and seed for us, knowing we give no care whatsoever to you.

Would LOVE a dual-audio rip with good subs and NO hardcoded crap like above. Don't get me wrong, I'm glad to have a good copy, but I love Cowboy Bebop and it seems REALLY lame and selfish that LonghornXtreme felt the need to mar the artists' perfection with his name by tagging it."
