,LatynMommy,2008-02-26T06:51Z,If you didn't see the tittle then you have a problem!?!
,zeinabqureshi,2008-04-16T22:29Z,"Frankly, this is a good rip. Small size, good quality. In my opinion, download subtitles from subscene.com or from opensubtitles, and use this file instead of any other. 
Though heavily seeded, it took me more than four days to complete the d/l.
Thanks for the up."

,x_d,2009-08-02T14:48Z,"As per torrent info, language is not English, and neither is the subtitles.  I have not been able to find an English subtitle file which has the matching start time and also at the right speed.  Anyway I have corrected one which I have now uploaded.  Let me know if there are errors.

,Phazzed,2009-09-08T19:11Z,"@Tremors 

Wtf? It's not gay porn. It's an actual movie... Just because it is not in your language it doesn't make things gay. Maybe you yourself just rub one off thinking everything is gay. Well I like this movie. Hope the download is great!"
