This is a copy of a torrent on TorrentSpy for which the tracker disappeared. I got tired of seeding for no one.

I have just copied it and use the same piece size, etc. I do not know if you can use any partial torrent already downloaded from the other place, but I have changed nothing so perhaps it is possible. 

I have a low upload speed but will not abadon the torrent. Seeding will be daytime and evenings Europeean time, not during the nights.
