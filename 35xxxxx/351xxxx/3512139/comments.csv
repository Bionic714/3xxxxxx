,Froh,2006-08-14T15:56Z,"Many tnx dude/dudette...

Hope you can get the season 2 also ;) Would be GREAT. But that is perhaps not done yet!?"
,Consider-Phlebas,2006-08-14T18:42Z,"Thanks!
Dude, actually. Too old to be watching this according to standard norms, but also way too old to care ;-)
I should make clear that I take no credit for the quality of the episodes in this torrent (which is quite good), I do not even have the HW setup to rip TV. I was one of the last to get a full copy before the other torrent evaporated due to the tracker disappearing, and I thought that I for once could make a difference by uploading a new one. 
The second season of W.I.T.C.H. seems to be airing somewhere, and I've seen torrents for episode 6-7 or so. Have not downloaded any of them yet, though. I will start collecting, and if no one else makes a Season 2 torrent I might do it when we have all the episodes.
This torrent shows good health by now, I can see 60+ peers in Azuresus, and I've also seen that a couple of people with partial downloads from the previous one seems to have joined."
,Consider-Phlebas,2006-08-14T19:11Z,"Before anyone asks: 
If you have problems playing the files on your computer get VLC from www.videolan.org; it's free, it's available for several platforms, it's one of the best players available, and you can forget about downloading any codecs.
If you want to convert to DVDs try for example ConvertXtoDVD from VSO, it worked fine for me and is not expensive. This set of files fitted into 3 disks."
,Consider-Phlebas,2006-08-14T22:05Z,"I've been looking for season 2 episodes on various sites, and found reasoable torrents from 2-9. For episode 1, however, it does not look promising, the only one with anyone connected had a peer with 0.8% and the same tracker that vanished weeks ago...
Someone knows a working S02E01 torrent, or could upload?"
,Consider-Phlebas,2006-08-16T18:08Z,"The dead tracker has now revived itself, and with it a viable torrent for S02E01!"
,Consider-Phlebas,2006-08-16T21:13Z,"This torrent has now reached a availability of a full set of files and many peers are nearing completion. I hope that some of you will stay around a while and seed. I will be around for a reasonable time, but will soon seed less frequently and diminish the upload for this torrent so that I can support other things as well. Enjoy!"
,Messerschmitt,2006-08-17T10:02Z,"It's great tho I would hope for a season 2. I already have the full season 1 in my own language, which frankly I prefer much more over english, since the people translating know how to transform the jokes and words from english to make it realy fun."
,Consider-Phlebas,2006-08-18T22:02Z,Test with a smaller comment (I'm just getting Database error when I try to answer...)
,Consider-Phlebas,2006-08-18T22:04Z,I'm collecting and I will publish a Season 2 when it is ready (and if no one else beats me to it).
,Consider-Phlebas,2006-08-18T22:05Z,You can however already find s2 ep 1-9 in various torrents on TPB other sites.
,Consider-Phlebas,2006-09-01T09:54Z,"Wow - the DL, Seed / Leech statistics has started to work again :-) Plenty more than 3 DL so far, though, according to the swarm statistics in my client..."

,wujin,2006-09-18T18:29Z,hi just registerd here but i cant get it to work even with vlc so what am i doing wrong  
,Consider-Phlebas,2006-09-20T20:58Z,"wujin - if you can't get VLC to play the files I don't know what to do. Contact a computer knowledgeable friend.
If you are asking how to download, that is not with VLC, you need a bittorrent client. See
http://thepiratebay.org/howdoidownload.php
and/or search the web for bittorrent or bit torrent."
,wujin,2006-09-21T16:27Z,thnx anyway
,wujin,2006-09-22T20:32Z,"well got a converter and its says file is corrupted

damn i hav bad luck al the time"
,Consider-Phlebas,2006-09-22T22:05Z,"I've played all the files myself successfully, and I've got no other reports of corrupted archives, so yes, you we're probably only unlucky. Hope you manage to sort it out."
,cathrine20,2006-09-22T22:43Z,can you get all episode of season 2 of w.i.t.c.h.
,Consider-Phlebas,2006-09-22T23:56Z,"Answered you in a PM, Cathrine."
,wujin,2006-09-23T12:49Z,well i thought i would give vlc another try no i got no sound and a warning of some unknown format any one got an idea :(
,Consider-Phlebas,2006-09-24T20:09Z,"I tried Windows normal Media player as well, and it works like a charm. Either your computer or your download is corrupted."
,wujin,2006-09-25T10:08Z,yeah thought so to so i downloaded it again from here and another site and if it still doesnt work i will have to watch them on youtube.

,Consider-Phlebas,2007-10-14T13:12Z,"OK guys - this is not working out well - people are not seeding back enough so I have to fill in all the time to keep it alive. 
I will support it for some time more, but in the end I will leave for other ventures... 
Please help by seeding to > 1! The more the merrier."
,Consider-Phlebas,2007-12-15T12:15Z,I will delete this from my hard drive somewhere after New Year. I will seed a bit heavier the last few days.
,greymon8,2008-07-18T02:32Z,PLEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAZ SEED! I'M STUCK ON 75%. i would appreciate it.
,Level10,2009-12-28T05:11Z,I'll seed this torrent for a good while if I can finish it.
