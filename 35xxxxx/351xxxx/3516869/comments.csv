,theLured,2006-12-01T00:50Z,"Not sure what kkaos is complaining about not knowing the codec when if you are going to watch this documentary you already use Linux and know that mplayer/gmplayer is such a good movie player.
This documentary is basically about Linux and the Open Source and Free Software movement. In plain English a load of nerds talking about computers :).
If you really need the stats for some reason here is the output from idvid.

I have just finished watching this and the video quality is not great. It is inbetween VHS and DVD quality. The sound quality is ok, but fluctuates a bit. Still very watch able.
The documentary might bore most people. It is only interesting if you really want to know the history of how Linux evolved.
the best quote from the documentary is at 00:58:15 ""There any chairs around here?"" because it is randomly added.
Also check out the cool ghost effect at 00:09:34"
