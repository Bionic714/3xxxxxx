How can file-sharing be bad for the music industry? :)"
,katjing,2006-10-05T21:15Z,"1. They count every downloaded record as a loss.

2. Not everyone buys a record they like since they've already got it. Partially because music is too expensive and too much go down the pockets of the companies and not the artists. Also, the kind of people downloading music are usually young with a very limited economy. Going to the store to buy a record is also a lot of unecessary trouble."

Oh and by the way its not really ""Heavy Metal"" its ""Power Metal"""
