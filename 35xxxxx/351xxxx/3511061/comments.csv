,fragility666,2008-02-01T16:53Z,i cant believe this. torrent has been going since 2006 and nobody has the fucking decency to warn others that there are a/v sync issues with this. dont download.

Precisely what I was thinking when I finished downloading.
The nonsense edit that the author have made to the filme has desync'ed Audio from Video...
It's frustrating to have spent 2 days dl'ing this to have Bishop say ""children"" 1 second before he opens the mouth to talk!
It's incredible how people seed bad rips regardless of minimum quality!
Fuck this."
