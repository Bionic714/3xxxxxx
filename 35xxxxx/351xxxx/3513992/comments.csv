so if this is the case if someone could find it somewhere else and add the tracker that would be much appreciated."

,dgg3jab,2006-09-04T19:46Z,"Good work, but what emulator ( and what settings) should I use. I am using UMD emulator V0.8C (by humma kavula et al). It recognises the iso but when I try to start the game I get the error message ""the game could not be started (FFFFFED3)"" 

Please advice, I can't wait to get my hands on the virtual pig skin!"
