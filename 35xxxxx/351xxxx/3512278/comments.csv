,Rammstone,2006-08-17T03:54Z,"carlton palmer, I cant say it any better than the readme does. Just extract files from the TapaniPatch-3[1].06.3beta.rar into your cm0102/data folder and run the cmpatcher-3.06.2.exe"
,Rammstone,2006-08-17T03:55Z,"This is what the readme says..

1. Extract the files to you Data folder
2. Run cmpatcher-3.06.exe and select your settings
3. Enable NT or 98 compatibility mode if using windows XP"

,Pirate_02,2010-01-08T15:23Z,"You can download Championship manager 3 (01-02) at picktorrent.com
http://www.picktorrent.com/torrents/d8/championship-manager/

For those of you who are new, Championship manager 3 has three editions:
1. Championship manager 3 (1999-2000)
2. Championship manager 3 (2000-2001)
3. Championship manager 3 (2001-2002)

After this they released Championship manager 4

So if you see the title Championship manager 01-02, that means it is Championship manager 3 (2001-2002 release)

I am currently downloading with decent speed....

Also remember there is a forum with regular updates for this game
