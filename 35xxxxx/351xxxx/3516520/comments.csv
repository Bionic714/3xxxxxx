,Crazynutt,2008-01-05T12:07Z,"This is a great upload, thanks...although, we really need some seeders! I'm stuck at 92.5%!!!

I'd love the rest of this album.
Thanks!"
,LoveShined,2008-03-11T02:06Z,Please please seed the rest of this album; me and at least a dozen other peers are stuck at 92.4%. I'm sure I'm not the only one who'd like to hear the whole thing

I did not know Jean-Luc Ponty created a tradition, but if he did, CL was certainly not influenced by it: both artists began their careers at the same time, in the late '60s. You really should try that Google thing.

CL has alway experiment with different musical styles: don't think this album is all there is to the lady."
[T],thegreenfrog,2009-06-11T17:35Z,"Forgot to mention this: I am going to upload a bunch of early CL songs soon. 

Of course, in the preceeding comment, I meant to say 'experimented', not 'experiment'."
