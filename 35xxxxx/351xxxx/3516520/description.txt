"Aral" is violinist Catherine Lara and that facile name reversal is a good reflection of the music inside her debut album. Produced by Eric Mocquet of Deep Forest, it shares his penchant for global pillaging and upbeat grooves. They've packaged it all together on Aral, with sampled voices and ethnic instrumental accents emerging out of the mix, commenting on Lara's violin melodies. She's a fiery player, coming out of the Jean-Luc Ponty tradition, and much of this music veers closer to jazz-fusion music than you might suspect.
