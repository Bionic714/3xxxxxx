,xenu dot net,2006-08-28T16:48Z,"Influenced as much by the lounge scene specialised by Air as much as 80s electro-pop, Alpinestars B.A.S.I.C album was an enjoyable if rather superficially good album rescued by a few moments of clarity. 'White Noise' represents a substantial progression that is pleasingly eclectic. 'NuSEX City', Snow Patrol' and 'Vital Love Disciple' are icy slices of pop that comply with the theme of the album, that of slushy, easy listening pop. All are fine enough but something more is required and Richard Woolgar and Glyn Thomas deliver through their decision to experiment. 'Burning Up' has a nagging bass hook that will not be shaken off, 'Brotherhood' and 'Lovecraft' are almost semi-classical interludes to break the mood. Even the vocals improve, 'Crystalnight' and 'New Ice Age' convey real emotion in their lovelorn delivery and the choice of Abi Tucker to deliver the folky bonus track 'Partisan Song' is an inspired one. In this company the appearance of Brian Molko is an unnecessary and unwelcome one, 'Carbon Kid' sounds just like a rather average Placebo track. By casting their net wider than before, Alpinestars have found themselves to be far more than a one-dimensional nostalgia project."
