Instead of telling you to help seed and that will help everyone get all the files faster I'd rather explain why I am. 

It's for more than just a vendetta.  It's for a dear friend of mine.  She always talked about the series and I always ignored it.  Now I have this and I really do want to share it with everyone.  Hope you all enjoy.


Will miss u hailey and I'm sorry.

,mikaoj83,2006-10-07T14:25Z,"Hmm, just get error's when i try watching any episode. don't understand why really, i have all the latest codec-packs ;("

,Pistara,2007-01-05T13:03Z,mikaoj83!1 use vlc player almost everything works there. the best!
,Quirky_Puppy,2007-01-19T17:26Z,"Can we have some sort of concerted opinion as to whether this works or not please? 2969 people have downloaded it!

Can someone tell me if mikaoj83 is right, and some of the files are invalid, or if Red_Snake is right and there are episodes missing?

Is this in a disk image format?"
,HEzooL,2007-02-16T12:51Z,"@ Quirky_Puppy

theese are not images, only avi.-files =(

personally I'd much rather have 'em on image format :-P"
,goodrejects,2007-06-05T05:29Z,"NONE OF THE EPISODES ARE MISSING. Anyone who actually followed the series would know that the first two episodes of the series were compiled into the 'Battlestar Galactica' movie. They aren't missing; just not usually included when talking about the series.

If you want the first two episodes, watch the movie."
,eonic451,2007-06-20T23:17Z,Thanks for posting and seeding!  Downloading faster than most (188).  I'll seed for sure!
,axts01,2008-02-10T19:11Z,"All episodes work fine. Season 1 is great quality, but season 2 is quite bad - looks as though you are watching the screen through the bottom of a drinking glass. 

Also if you are watching this from scratch you will have to download the miniseries 2 part pilot to understand what is going on."
,NawwNaw,2010-06-21T02:23Z,Seed Plx! have been downloading for 2 days with avarage 30 kb/s and like 3x uppload :S will seed this for a loooong time so plx gimme 100%!
