,Souls,2006-08-17T18:58Z,"They already tried forbidding alchohol... Prohibition, anyone?

That didn't go down too well. Bootleggers, gangs, etc. etc..."
,johnnyfacker2,2007-03-28T00:40Z,"Therefore making prohibition just like the U.S. war on drugs (are we seeing a pattern yet?, look at amsterdams crime rate and compare it to areas in the U.S.) "
,shlnmastakilla,2007-08-29T17:34Z,"sooo yeah theres lots of gang activity and widespread use just like prohibition, but  i think by that time everyone had already had a beer, not everyone, and probly most people who are againt weed havnt smoked it"
,bluecarvw,2008-03-18T14:34Z,"It is interesting to learn thatr alcohol prohibition was a smoke screen to ban ethanol for fuel as it was 25 percent of the market and was becoming a threat to the oil industry.  The made everyone believe it was a moral issue.  Quite deceptive!
