Historically, the Ordo Templi Orientis has been greatly offended by the availability of this text. It was available on the internet here and there... until its removal was requested or forced. This pdf file MAY deliberate many of the long-hidden internal secrets of the organization. It would be wrong to verify the truth or falsehood of that statement. If it IS true, then Francis King commited the same offense as Crowley in reference to breaking a magical oath and publishing the "secrets" of the order in which they were respectively involved. In spite of the hypocrisy and disorder that existed within the Stella Matutina, I believe the publishing of the Golden Dawn teachings was one of Crowley's great gifts to the world. Why should this be anything less? Crowley's reputation shines far more than King's... but Crowley's writings were never so forcefully suppressed. 

In the meantime I am just curious as to whether or not I will be asked to stop seeding... Enjoy it while it lasts.
