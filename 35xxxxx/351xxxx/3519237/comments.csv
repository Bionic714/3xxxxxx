,Bamimi,2006-09-05T08:18Z,"wel thats one person who is asking for you TO seed. heh, this stuff is useless no one cares about secret organisations anymore because its the era of disinformation, so everything is subject to being false and thus no one believes it anyways."
,angma,2006-09-05T18:26Z,"Yeah... the controversy has died down. I haven't heard much about it in a long time. I'm seeding because I am curious. There is really nothing to ""believe"" in the document insofar as it is history--very important history in terms of occultism. Someone IS interested, and that is all that matters. ..just making sure this document does not disappear from the hands of those who need it most and, ""in this era of disinformation"" i really don't think it can fall into the ""wrong hands."" (Partially because of the internet and free dissemination of information...)"

2. The OTO is still active and very much alive today, so there is someone that cares a great deal about this kind of documents. Not that you have anything to fear, quite on the contrary.
3. Love is the Law - Love under will!"

,nchvshtn,2008-01-06T05:05Z,please seed! I must have this text!
,benmack,2008-09-21T10:40Z,"I'll politely ask you to stop seeding this.  The availability of this text is a threat to the safety of the OTO's members because it contains various statements which could be construed in an anti-governmental fashion which, in this modern police state, is a threat.  If you think such connections don't have backlash, you're wrong, and it'd be a respectful act in OTO's and AC's honour to stop seeding. "
,amentii,2009-02-01T15:08Z,"I find it utterly amusing that someone would feel like ""OTO members"" are threatened by comments within this book.  If that is the case, perhaps they should quit the OTO because they follow the same rituals almost to the letter (changing only a very few things) and they certainly don't change the extreme sexism against women that is in the text in ""De Natura Deorum.""  I suggest you quit the OTO if its offensive to you what is in this book, further - please keep seeding because for every person who learns the truth and every book of these obtained for free (and open), is less they have over us all."
