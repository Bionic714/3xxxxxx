Great work, I love those DVDs!
Could you please reseed DVD 11? I'm stuck at 83% for days. And is there a chance to get the DVDs 5,6,7,10, 12 and 13? They are not listed anywhere on PirateBay :-("
,peter7a,2006-08-20T19:00Z,"Thanks very much for your time and dedication.
Truly a huge effort on your part and its very much appreciated."
,denzel-uk,2006-08-20T21:20Z,"thanks so much hexen, you have been amazing and with little error"
,KayJayDK,2006-08-21T00:46Z,"Thanks once again.

And again, could someone please reseed #7? I lost it on the way and it's not seeded anymore."
,thatsmine,2006-08-21T02:36Z,"nico42 , there was 1 fake torrent that got stuck somewhere near the end because of NO seeders , i wonder if it was 11 ? (i got bad memory)

Hexen-Ni thanx buddy ! reading what daqck commented i can only say thanx for all the work !"
,dirtmaster,2006-08-21T19:00Z,"5,6,7 and 10, 11, 12, 13 are the only torrrents that are missing, all others are still running strong. 

Couldn't some of you that have the complete set so far please reseed those volumes? I've got a 10/10 connection so it wouldn't take much time before they are up and running again. Thanx!"
,063341,2006-08-23T01:56Z,"i have all 19 torrents done so far and the pc is seeding constantly, never switched off so i dont know why some people are stuck with partial download. bushtorrent lists number 11, i dont know where i found the others listed, i just kept searching all the other torrent websites. will seed all forever."
,nico42,2006-08-23T07:18Z,"Hello 063341,

could you than please, please post the torrent files for the missing DVDs here on this site? Otherwise we would not be able to download from you. Thanks a lot!

,FourthTry,2006-08-23T13:11Z,"Anybody noticed a small detail...this volume, back cover, there are two small typing errors...Resotred instead of Restored. Description of tTitles 'Liberty' and 'Wrong Again'"
,FourthTry,2006-08-23T13:12Z,"And there is a small typing error also in my previous message...boy, this is contagious."
[V],Hexen-NI,2006-08-23T14:47Z,"I promised I will have all 21 DVD's completed by September, so:  DVD 21 later on tonight (Wed) or sometime tomorrow (Thurs)."

,olivernorwellhardy,2007-11-11T18:25Z,any chance for a re-seed? thanks
,Drowlord,2008-01-09T20:29Z,"TPB deleted a few of these Hexen-NI Laurel and Hardy torrents because of outdated trackers and external tracker urls in the torrent.  I have found them all on other tracker sites, and attempted to correct them for posting on TPB.  However, I thought I knew how to do that, but when I tried it it appeared that I would have to remove trackers that contained active seeds and I didn't want to create a gimpy torrent.  So... I created a torrent filled with all of Hexen-NI's torrents.  Kinda lame, I Know.  Here it is: http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3969220/Laurel_and_Hardy_DVD_Vol_1-21_Torrents_by_Hexen-NI

Also... I've ripped all of these DVD's to XviD, and I'll post a torrent with these soon (when my seeding capacity isn't saturated by all these ISO's)"
,Drowlord,2008-02-10T18:32Z,"As promised, the entire collection's DVD Rips in XviD format: http://thepiratebay.org/tor/4021071/Laurel_and_Hardy_Movies_-_DVDRips_-_142_Movies"
,Armoured-Fury,2008-08-17T16:13Z,"Thank you!  I'm actually doing the opposite.. I'm going from 21 back to 1 lol.

Already downloaded 21, took me about a day and a half so it's not that bad.

Might need to buy some larger DVD's though i only have standard 4.7Gig.. Anybody know of a way to fit this much onto a disc that big?"
