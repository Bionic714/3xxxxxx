,Mr_Ecks,2006-08-20T08:08Z,Thanks! I missed this when it was a new release. I just drag n' drop the file and I never ever bothered making a iso-file.
,Mr_Ecks,2006-08-20T08:17Z,You have to seed your own torrent... It won't work unless You do. By the way... is it PAL or NTCS? Thats bloody important tho know if anyone intends to watch it on tv.
,Mr_Ecks,2006-08-20T08:33Z,Well this one seems to get a seed atleast...
,Mr_Ecks,2006-08-20T08:36Z,I spoke to early... He stoped seeding. What a fuck!
,Cremmm,2006-08-20T13:46Z,"Why donÂ´t you shut and be thankful & patient, Mr Eck? Otherwise, go buy the goddamned dvd."
,l19bal,2006-08-20T15:56Z,Yes the movie is in PAL
,Mr_Ecks,2006-08-20T16:26Z,Cremmm>> Shut the fuck up... It isn't suposed to take over two hours to start seeding. Mind Your own buisness. The other seeds were eronous and if nobody sais so it's imposible for the original seeder to do anything about it.
,l19bal,2006-09-02T17:56Z,Yo ppl. Stop fucking arguing. I am seeding all my torrents 24 hours a day 5 days a week and sometimes even 24-7. and the main problem is tht im the only one seeding it. so once you have downloaded it can u plzzz seed it. it would be greatly appreciated
,l19bal,2006-09-02T17:58Z,There is some software on www.vso-software.fr called copytodvd. This works really good and all u have to do is copy the contents of a VIDEO_TS folder of this movie to the VIDEO_TS folder of the BLANK DVD. If you need a serial or crack email me l19bal@hotmail.com
,zippydog02,2007-06-27T18:37Z,"So I got so pissed at the MPAA because the put anti-piracy BS all over my LEGALLY BOUGHT dvd, I decided to go online and help seed it. Fuck you MPAA. I will be seeding this for the next week at least. Enjoy."
