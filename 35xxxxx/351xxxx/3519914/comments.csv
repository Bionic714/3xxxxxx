,David-7237,2006-09-06T11:09Z,"Thank you... but I think PSS sucks

well, I have got SSTSIM Concorde and working but not everything..
I have the installer and the update and then the crack..I can fly the airplane but when I need to set the Center Fuel in the panel, I just cann't...also, when I want to config fuel or load..when I press on it, it crashes to desktop(the config)   I don't know what's wrong with it... SSTSIM is a way better than PSS

REQ.
-------

1- FS2Crew PMDG 747 installer to crack it

2- Angle of Attack 767 DV"
,legendary_goku,2006-09-06T21:26Z,Yes David i've seen the SSTSIM plane around here but nobody has actually managed to crack it and make it work without problems....That's what i actually guessed..The SSTSIM Concorde is probably WAAAAY better than this one..Too bad it's so tight on security that we can't make it work....
,legendary_goku,2006-09-07T12:14Z,"Hey redarrows i received your pm so go fuck yourself you fucking childish noob! i don't accept insults like yours! If you want to contribute something good then upload it in one rarred file you idiot! By the way the SSTSIM concorde is way better ;) i know somebody who has both concordes but he actually bought them and he was more satisfied with the SSTSIM even though there was no clickable VC... So shut up...I know that there are many children here on TPB with no respect to tohers..I never even insulted your work but i'm doing so now because you deserve it....Damn you know i've only met a few nice people over here which are popart,mogz,rexxxifon and many other which ive forgotten the name but ive met more disrespectfull, hated childish noobs on here who just seem to insult other people...I don't know where those people come from but i would recommend them to get a life and have some education so they know how to treat other people decently and respectfully"
,belga1,2006-09-07T16:54Z,This one is a turtle indeed....the King Air 350 fly more speedy..lol.

,Golf3188,2007-05-21T19:00Z,"Block IP's of people not seeding? And you're really gonna check that? Man.. your not just an attetion whore but also a ""credits"" whore.

Look where all this b*tching around got you..a dead torrent."
,airman123,2008-01-17T15:59Z,"If you have downloaded this torrent, then you have helped put PSS out of buissness. That means they will make no more addons. For proof, go to ""http://www.phoenix-simulation.co.uk"" and see for your self. I hope your happy!"
,SIG_550,2008-02-23T02:33Z,"Blaming TPB for it sounds all to easy, doesn't it? Piracy is one thing......

pricing policy, upgrading, etc another ........."
,bogey4brian,2008-06-04T05:37Z,"While airman123 continues to spread his love for PSS (probably because he worked there), he has failed to do so with facts. It is not the torrent sharing system that has cost PSS. After all, the only money PSS could possibly lose from torrents is from those who would have purchased the product had sites like this not been available. I highly doubt that there are enough people who would have otherwise purchased this product legitimately that would make any notable difference in sales. Also, airman123 (aka PSS) has failed to note that PSS products are generally pathetic, with inaccurate and poorly designed systems management. And finally, the prices at PSS would have you believe that there products are on par with quality flight simulator products, such as those from PMDG, Level-D, Flight 1 and others. This is far from reality. The LDS 767 is miles beyond any PSS aircraft and cheaper than most. In closing, airman123 (PSS) should consider all of this before he re-opens the site. Perhaps with some proper planning you will manage not to fail miserably next time, though I'm sure you will."
