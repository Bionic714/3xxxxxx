Seems I missed getting the base pack for this so I have a request.

Can someone please seed this http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3505823/FS2004_-_FranceVFR_FlightParis_Base_Pack

Or just reseed the flightparis base pack?

This is the autogen pack for France VFR FlightParis & the aircraft collection for the same pack.

The autogen pack is an installer with serial....the aircraft collection is a rip.

The flightparis Base pack must 1st be installed to use this pack.

Of course this is untested because I do not have the base pack. I did run the installer however & it did run fine.
