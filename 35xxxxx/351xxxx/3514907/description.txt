TORRENT UPLOADER COMMENT:

Not worth the US$20 price tag though still a good read with some indepth information about the history of pocket bikes, a basic understanding of how they work, and what you can do to make them go faster.

The Ebook focuses on the China (Cag) Pocket bikes, and only refers to the European mini motos for comparison.

Please buy it from www.pocket-bike-secrets.com if you think you got something out of this book to justify the US$20 price tag.
