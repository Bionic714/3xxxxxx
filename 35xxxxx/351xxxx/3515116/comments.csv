,Spironic,2008-11-11T21:31Z,"FFS, stop saying PacSteam allows you to download ""all Steam games"".  It doesn't.  I think there's maybe about 2 dozen games you can download with it.

Yes, it SHOWS all Steam games in your games list. But no, it does not actually allow you to download all of them.

It certainly isn't useless, (I love the Setti Servers mod)  but for christ sake, stop lying about this software."

,kilotx,2009-07-06T12:46Z,OK all create a new account for saftey if you already have an account with any game on it dont use it incase you get banned uyou wont loose your old account.And yes you can be permament banned with this proggram so i advise you to creata a new blank account!Ok alla gör en ny account för säkerhets skull om du redan har en account med nåt slags spel på den använd inte! den ifall du blir bannad du har din orginella account med spel på kvar man kan bli permament bannad så jag råder er att göra en ny tom account.
,samanoskeake,2009-07-22T20:48Z,"PacSteam is totally not worth it. I've used it before, and I was really disappointed. It's a lot easier just to torrent non-steam versions, or XBLA versions that were converted over, seeing as how Steam has tons of those games, and anything that isn't an arcade-type game can be run as a standalone without the use of Steam."
