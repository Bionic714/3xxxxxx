,ds25,2008-04-08T19:03Z,"Does anyone know how to get this thing installed? How do I use the .bin, .cue and .nfo files? Thanks!"
,ihtiaon,2008-05-25T20:40Z,ds25 you can load the .nfo file in notepad to read info/instructions (nfo = info). You should be able to load the .cue file in an image burning program such as imgburn and burn it to a CD-R. the .bin basically holds all the data and the .cue file is a sort of index for it.
,trancemix07,2008-06-11T20:58Z,"Man I LOVE THIS TORRENT. I was thinking that this was going to have less functionality then the trial i am using directly from their website, so all i did was used this serial included on the trial and UNEXPECTEDLY it worked. I had other serials from the web that just didnt work for some reason, but this one did. 

In any case i could have just used this program but i didnt know if it would do what i needed. 

DOES ANYONE know how many more NEW VERSIONs this serial will work for. Its working on 7.5.508 right now, and im guessing like other programs the serials good until the next version, in this case 8.x. THIS IS A GREAT TORRENT, definetly worth the wait. 

After using Roxio 10's BackOnTrack, and Norton Save and Restore 2.0, and wasting 20 dvd's trying to span data off my my HDD across multiple discs ,, i found this program and decided to use the trial. It worked great!! I will be seeding and maybe uploading it myself with the new version 7.5.508 included and maybe we will get better download speeds  

 thanks ermoura"
,delugaz,2008-12-15T17:56Z,Totally useless without serial. :(
,trenton24,2009-07-10T09:31Z,"The serial is in the CYGiSO folder you dopes, it says that in the nfo - why do people post before reading the nfo's?

The program is clean and works great by the way"
,curlykale,2009-11-05T12:02Z,Double click on the image file and use nero or whatever.  When the disc is burnt it will be an install disc. Right click on the disc and you'll see the CYGiSO folder mentioned.  LA la la la
,ThatMuslimGuy,2011-01-24T08:36Z,Can we please get some seeds? It's not moving at all. :(
