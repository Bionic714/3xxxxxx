The Brown Bunny is a film by actor/director Vincent Gallo that had its world premiere at the 2003 Cannes Film Festival, where it played in competition. Critical reaction was so hostile that the film quickly became labeled the worst in the festival's history, and many journalists even questioned the entire festival's artistic direction in admitting it in the first place.

The film is a rambling odyssey about a motorcycle racer (played by Gallo) who undertakes a cross-country van drive in search of his former lover. The road scenes received especially heavy ridicule, consisting as they do of lengthy unbroken shots out the van's windshield, and one sequence in which Gallo parks the van and washes it, which plays in real time. Further ridicule was based on the fact that the film's cost was estimated at $10 million (it eventually grossed $356,734 in a limited U.S. release).

But the strongest outrage was reserved for the film's final scene, in which Gallo's character finally meets up with his ex-lover (ChloÃ« Sevigny), and she performs unsimulated fellatio upon him.
