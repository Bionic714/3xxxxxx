North Africa has always been a source of fascination to people from other parts of the world, yet it remains one of the most misunderstood regions. Everyone from Emperors (Napoleon) to rock stars (The Rolling Stones & Led Zeppelin) have traveled to North Africa to explore and, in many cases, exploit the cultural and physical riches of this diverse and prolific region. While the terrain from Egypt to Morocco is arid and often barren, it supports one of the most musically fertile regions of the world. A rich classical tradition is joined by unique and surprisingly vibrant modern music evolving from traditional and folk expressions. From the bubbling funk of Algerian rai to the entrancing polyrhythms of the Moroccan Gnawa, sophisticated Egyptian pop to rootsy Nubian soul, the music of North Africa has much to offer.
