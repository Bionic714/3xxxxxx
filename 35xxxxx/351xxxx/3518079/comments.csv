,Massmordaren,2006-09-01T16:22Z,"And, as usual, the comments doesn't say anything but, ""request, request, request"".
Is it really so hard to spell the small word ""thanks""?

By the way - thank you, mad_flyer!"
,rikzter7674,2006-09-01T16:38Z,"I agree Massmordaren. People these days just keep requesting but no ""thank you's"""

,mad_flyer,2006-09-01T17:31Z,@BobDaSlob: Fuck Off Bob. I haven't seen you upload anything. At least have the decency to say thanks. Load of rotting shit you are. 
,airbus320,2006-09-01T17:34Z,"Bob are you fucking buying these addons with your hard earned money and sharing them with us? No you arn't dipshit, so STFU low-life."
,The_Hangar_18,2006-09-01T18:19Z,"LOL Bod,
""i'll let you bang my wife""
Give me your adress, i bring you iris f14, und give me a hour or two ^^"
,belga1,2006-09-01T18:54Z,"Bod..give adress please szo we will make a gang bang.. : Thank's a lot for the upload.Me think..many requesters here must preferably post their request in a torrent as txt.... :)
Annoying requests and no thank's....
BTW..thank's are never annoying for the poster."
,keemoosabi,2006-09-01T18:56Z,"With people like you in this world bobdaslob no wonder it is going down the pan, which I might add is exactly where you and your mouth should be!!!!! Some of us totally appreciate the generocity of people sharing these items, so why not go off and play with mummy arse wipe??? And don't worry we won't cry if you don't share anymore because there are plenty who will!!!!!!!"
,Rexxxifon,2006-09-01T19:41Z,"Any woman that would marry bobsafuckingslob would probably give you crabs anyways.

No more sharing bob? Hmm, never noticed. Fuck off and die!"
,ak111,2006-09-02T02:43Z,thx very much
,FSSR.Keyno,2006-09-02T07:53Z,"BobASlob, have you gone off the deep end??

Talking about crash and burn!"
,Massmordaren,2006-09-03T18:05Z,"""so fuck off wanker""

I cannot see any reason for the use of such harsh language. Swearing only makes things worse.

If you are not able to deliver your critisism in a more propriate way, you should not speak at all."
,Horatio85,2007-01-12T17:40Z,"Seed please
