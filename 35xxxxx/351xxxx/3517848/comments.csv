,micleg,2006-08-31T23:22Z,"Correction: Schulze is not even the producer of this album. From his discography: ""There exists an album called Drive Inn II, but despite the fact that Klaus Schulze's name is put on the cover, it is a Rainer Bloss solo project. Furthermore, there exists a Drive Inn III by Rainer Bloss. Klaus Schulze has nothing to do with it or any other of Rainer Bloss' solo recordings."""
