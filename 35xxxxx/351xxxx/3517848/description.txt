Re-seed of someone else's torrent I downloaded some months ago.

It's Rainer Bloss' album "Drive Inn II" which has some really interesting tracks. Better than "part 1" I think, but this time Klaus Schulze is producer only.


Tracks:

1 The Long Way To Acapulco (4:43)
2 Dessert Inn (4:31)
3 Berliner Nachtmusik (6:26)
4 Pleasant Voyage (3:13)
5 Pan Americana (4:19)
6 Drive Me Funky (7:27)
7 Millers Continental (4:35)
8 Lovely Hitch Hiker (3:58)
9 Highway (4:47)

Released 1990

Hard to find on CD? Rather impossible I would say.
