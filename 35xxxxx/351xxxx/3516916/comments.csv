,KiochiTehFox,2007-09-13T06:27Z,"Thanks a lot for seeding this. I've been trying to get 3.11 for workgroups for my old 286. And I still use Win95 and 98. I think 98 is built much better than 2000, XP or Vista. But that's only my opinion "
,joshua8790,2008-05-20T06:38Z,"i also agree, the older OS's were more simple and less complex and not stuffed full of a buncha crap you dont even use or need.other than slight incompatibility for some newer stuff older OS's are better (i like windows 95)"
