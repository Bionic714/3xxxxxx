Technical details
------------------------

Backups now automatically have pre-locked PSN range same as stated in extracted PFI sector if exists, or embedded PFI, therefore cannot read extracted SS/PFI/DMI sectors from disk. Currently all original 360 games have same PFI sector but maybe not in future, hence new feature of extracting PFI in Enable0800 mode and read from backup at PSN $4fb1d (Xbox 360) and $605fd (Xbox1) or if these sectors are blank embedded PFI will be used
 
Backups now support loading of DMI sector. This sector is different for every original 360 game but is currently not checked for, but maybe in future hence DMI can now be extracted also in Enable0800 mode and read from backup at PSN $4fb1e (Xbox 360) and $605fe (Xbox1)

Firmware checks for Enable0800 security sector @ PSN 04FB1F and if found, enables 0800 mode of firmware.
ISO image Enable0800.iso included. Just burn and insert into drive when you wish to extract security sectors or dump games.
0800 mode of firmware deactivated by inserting game backup (Xbox 360 or Xbox 1) or DVD movie or turning off console. 
Reads Xbox 360/Xbox 1 security sector from PSN FD021E (Layer 1)
Reads Xbox 360 security sector from PSN 04FB1F (Layer 0)
Reads Xbox 1 security sector from PSN 605FF (Layer 0)
Security sector must be extracted using Enable0800 DVD for Xbox360 games and Xbox 1 games
