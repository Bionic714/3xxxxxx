veteran David L. Wolper.

The mini-series starred Richard Chamberlain, Rachel Ward, Barbara Stanwyck, 
Christopher Plummer, Bryan Brown, Mare Winningham, Philip Anglim and Jean 
Simmons. It was directed by Daryl Duke.

Set primarily on Drogheda, a fictional sheep station in the Australian outback, 
the story focuses on the Cleary family and spans the years 1920 to 1962."
