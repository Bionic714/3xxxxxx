,dulli,2006-08-23T19:50Z,A tip. Seed.
,kaospilot,2006-08-23T23:42Z,thank you thank you thank you.
,Sargent_D,2006-08-25T05:38Z,What kind of FUCKED UP filenames did you use here? My WinRar won't recognize these as all parts of the same archive.
,kaospilot,2006-08-25T16:57Z,just open afo-xvid-devil 001-fil whit winrar and there you have the movie.
,burri,2006-08-25T22:18Z,thank you!!

,leagaloo,2008-02-08T03:02Z,"And what video player makes this work on a mac, por favor!!"
,Art_Vendelay,2008-02-09T12:27Z,this thing is super seeded i was gettin it at 800 kbs!!!!!!!!!!
,Art_Vendelay,2008-02-10T02:17Z," i saw this movie on tv, think it was ifc channel.  everyone says this guy is a genius & so great, his shit sounded pretty lame to me.  Sure a few of his early songs were good, but that casper song sux.  he sounds like brak from space ghost.  This is an awesome documentary tho, highly recommend it to all music lovers"
,leagaloo,2008-02-11T13:01Z,"I got it...! 
I couldent figure out winrar, sow i used stuffit 12.. litle bit messy but at at least one full time avi!!

Then lets hope this is wort the effort!"
,NASTY_138,2008-02-14T06:36Z,"Thanks so much for this. One of the best documentaries I've ever seen, and it works perfect.

Video - 10/10
Audio - 10/10

For anyone wondering how to get this to work, just open afo-xvid-devil 001 in WinRAR and it extracts the .avi. Just find the folder it's located in, copy and paste it to your desktop or your videos folder, and delete the original .avi."
,betsku,2008-02-27T10:51Z,"Hi! 
When im trying to open/extract this with powerarchiver 2004 it says that there is CRC error in afo_xvid_devil.016 Does anybody know how to fix this? "
,dihnekis,2008-12-25T08:11Z,"Broken, won't unzip with 7-zip."
,QuantumDriven,2009-08-24T12:25Z,"Okay I'm on this mofo, but it'll be the first god-damned rar file I've tried to open.  What the fuck am I supposed to do with this motherfucking shit after it downloads. On everything else I open with the VideoLan codec player.  But I don't know shit about rars.  The other torrent has been dead forever, btw.  I little help here. sonneymcdey@yahoo.com"
,IbarcodeI,2010-02-01T11:34Z,"Read previous comments or learn how to use zee GOOGLE... I PITY THE FOOL!

Thanks for the up, great doco. Just saw him live yesterday at Laneway! "
,nightowl4064,2010-03-05T08:39Z,"this isn't working for me either. winrar doesn't have any extraction option for these files, not for me anyway. i used hj-split, which joined them all together, but it stayed in that same weird unusable format, instead of becoming an avi file or whatever like these kind of files normally do."
,frenzyface,2010-04-03T17:58Z,thanks
,LifeSux,2010-04-15T01:50Z,Thank you!
,cbond1c,2010-05-05T14:52Z,"This file is absolute garbage. Will not open, play or extract whatever methods one might employ. Good thing it didn't take long to download. As a result, I can't complain of wasting too much time at it, but really..."
,Lumpy_Chewbacca,2010-05-08T03:09Z,I've downloaded a few movies with the files like this and I usually just click the first one and extract the avi. But I can't get winzip to read any of these. I'm pretty sure this isn't just me being a dumbass. I'd appreciate some help.
,Lumpy_Chewbacca,2010-05-08T03:18Z,I tried renaming all the files with .rar at the end and that didnt work. Says I'm missing a file or something. Not sure whats up.
,TacoSteve,2010-06-01T16:52Z,only assholes limit their UL speed to 5kbps. 
,TacoSteve,2010-06-03T17:19Z,"For those who's operating systems/winrars won't recognize the file(s)...

-Right click the first file (001)
-Select 'open with', winrar will not be listed under the programs to open this file
-Select winrar as the program in which to open the file
-Once in winrar just simply choose to extract to a specified location, done and done

and now you should have one long 698mb avi file of ""The Devil and Daniel Johnston""
enjoy"
,erich555,2010-07-06T01:00Z,"you're supposed to upload files, not butload them. "
,JackAssin,2011-07-23T14:35Z,"Warning:  If you're getting pop-ups about a new version of Bit Torrent blow the motherfucker off.  It's pure crap and will lasso your PC and cram a fake version of Google Chrome down your ass.

The fucking Danish brains that brought us TPB are takin' big $buck$ for spam now it appears."
,QuantumDriven,2011-07-24T20:55Z,"Hey it worked for me somehow. Didn't seem like other rar files though.

I unzipped rar file #1 but it disappeared.

Then I went to my downloads and clicked to play the whole bushel of rars on the file with VLC Player and the motherfucker worked.  Go figure."
,xMajesticMeteorx,2011-07-24T20:59Z,"This fucker Daniel Johnston is back in the mental hospital for finger-fucking a little girl, lol."
,JackAssin,2011-07-30T16:09Z,"His former manager uploaded this after Dan's brother brought complaint. The poor guy never made much off Dan, but was kind enough to give some rare master tapes (cassettes, lol!) back to the Johnston family.

But paybacks are hell baby, and so now we can sift through Daniel Johnston's over hyped ""genius"" for free.

Daniel Johnston is currently incarcerated for a rape spree upon age 8 - 11 girls in 1984, whereby Dan would lure girls into his corn dog trailer and tie them up at a traveling carnival."
,WhiteOprah,2011-09-15T17:57Z,"yeah seriously WTF is this format.  WinRar won't touch it, Rarzilla can't even see it.  I know this is your first upload but fuck me, delete this and put a valid format up here or at least get it off of here so ppl aren't wasting a bunch of bandwidth with this shit."
,rrpostal,2011-10-13T20:47Z,Calm down knuckleheads. This works fine. It's not that freaking complicated.
,rrpostal,2011-10-13T20:49Z,"Oh yeah, thanks for this. I've been wanting to see it. I was never aware of this kid. Unstable people and Gibby wouldn't mix well."
,Liliedugg,2012-08-12T22:49Z,Epic documentary. Thank you!
,anonpirateanon,2012-08-22T16:51Z,I was able to open torrent just fine after downloading.  I used winrar then played in vlc.
