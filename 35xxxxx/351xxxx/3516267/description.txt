Rip VBR
Fcover included.

The music of Portugal's former colonies in Africa - Cape Verde, Angola, Guinea-Bissau, and Mozambique - combines elements of African, Portuguese, and Brazilian music to create some of the most exquisite music the world has to offer. Featuring some of the most important figures in contemporary African music as well as many discoveries who aren't yet known outside their homeland, An Afro-Portuguese Odyssey captures the magic of a unique musical world. Putumayo's first collection of Afro-Portuguese music, the 1999 release Cape Verde, has become one of the label's biggest- selling and most beloved titles. An Afro-Portuguese Odyssey continues and expands on this journey by revisiting the music of Cape Verde and uncovering more melodic musical gems from other Lusophone (Portuguese-speaking) countries such as Angola, Guinea-Bissau, and Mozambique.
