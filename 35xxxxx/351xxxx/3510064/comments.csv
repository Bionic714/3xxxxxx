,crazy2be,2008-01-26T01:06Z,"how do you put this on floppys?
if you run setup.exe, it says:

""Setup cannot run from within Windows NT. you need to shut down Windows NT, and then start MS-DOS. If you have a previous version of Windows, start that version and then run Setup. Otherwise, run setup from MS-DOS."""
,crazy2be,2008-01-26T01:14Z,"I'm Guessing this is a CD version...

of course, you need a floppy to boot MS-DOS, then drivers for the CD, THEN you can run setup.exe. 

unless there is a way to put it on floppys."
,Artuir,2008-06-28T07:19Z,"This is the Windows 95 Upgrade disc, not the standalone."
,wbm56,2008-11-26T08:47Z,"If this is the CD version, the downloaded file should be a single .iso file ready to burn to a CD.
If this is the floppy version, there should be separate image (.img) files ready to copy to floppies.

This .rar package is neither.  It has 40 files in it, which appear to be what you would see if you directoried the CD version after burning it."
,dataguy,2010-05-06T12:49Z,PLEASE SEED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
,dataguy,2010-05-06T12:52Z,"THE USB thing, Google:
USB support for Windows 95"
,dataguy,2010-05-06T13:01Z,What is the directory structure of these files?
,raxp,2011-02-06T22:16Z,Thanks for torrent.
,fima_007,2011-12-12T18:28Z,"imho, this is cd version - just burn it in uiso or nero with DOSSETUP.BIN as a loader, all keys included"
