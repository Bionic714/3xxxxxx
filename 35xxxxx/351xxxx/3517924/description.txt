Discovery Channel - "Patent Bending".

The Patent Bending team scours books of patents from the past 100 years to find the seemingly greatest, strangest or most fantastically odd ideas that never got off the page - then figures out why.

Each episode identifies one idea and starts the process of bringing the invention to life. They build it, test it and they quickly figure out why it never worked. 

Season 1, Episode 1 - "Bicycle Lawnmower":
Cutting grass and cycling merge in these strange, mostly defective but sometimes effective versions of the "Bicycle Lawnmower." For nearly 100 years, a parade of would-be inventors have envisioned the future of lawn-cutting: a quiet, environmentally-friendly, healthy alternative to mowing the lawn - by bike. The Patent Bender crew takes this one on and goes for the ride of their lives.
