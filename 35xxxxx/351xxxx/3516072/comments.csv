,pcsjith,2011-09-07T20:56Z,If you could please seed...thanks in advance.
,darklotusegg,2012-01-07T08:31Z,"No doubt sounding like a broken record but can somebody please seed this? Been stuck at 23.7% for a week now. Really want to see this film and did consider buying it but the price for the retail dvd is OBSCENE.

Thanks for the original upload Feid. Hopefully you'll see this and reseed"
