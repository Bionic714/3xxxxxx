,jukeboxen1980,2006-09-01T18:03Z,if only pinball dreams and pinball fantasy was here... those old amiga games rock
,Thepieman,2006-09-02T00:25Z,"Yes the ones I played so far are all DOS based and a little buggy. They use the old DOS4GW. If you are using windows XP you might have to right click on the EXE and set the compatibility mode to windows 95.

,black francis,2006-09-03T12:59Z,"this rocks!!! I've been looking everywhere for psycho pinball and balls of steel! Screw pinball fantasies and pinball dreams, they've got nothing on this torrent. Keep seeding assholes :P"
,black francis,2006-09-03T13:07Z,"oh by the way. if you're having problems running these games I suggest you check out dosbox: 

http://dosbox.sourceforge.net/

which is a software that emulates dos in windows. It's pretty simple to use. just download and run it and type HELP or INTRO in the command prompt to get the assistance needed to get it running the games you wish to play. I've found that it works with almost every old dos based game that won't run properly in windows. What's even better is that dosbox emulates the old sound blaster pro soundcard as well so you get the proper sound as it should be! I owe it so much for leting me relive those moments I had so long ago. The Sierra and Lucasarts classics are just few of the games that I have run and completed on this software. Check it out."
,ryanbrancel,2006-09-19T10:03Z,Only want a few good ones... which ones should I choose to download?

,Henriku,2007-02-07T14:39Z,"Ok, can anyone here make the Addiction Pinball game work?
I mounted the fucker with daemon, which I'm positive should work just fine, and all I get is some encore ""pinball madness 2"" installation setup. Which kinda doesnt seem right. Also, the image file (nero file, i think) is about 700 megs, but when mounted it shows as just 155.

And when i try to open the addiction pinball setting itself, i get the good ol ""cant install a 16 bit on a 32 bit os"" shit.

Maybe I'm being totally stupid here, but help would really be appreciated. That game is awesome, and the soundtrack is even better. Got me really into BjĂ¸rn Lynne's stuff."
[T],Elq,2007-02-11T19:23Z,"!. Burn the image file ""AddictionPinball.nrg"" 
   with Nero.
2. Install the game = X:\AutoRun\Autorun.exe
    (X=your cd/dvd-drive)

I donÂ´t know if it works with Deamon tool."
,Darz,2007-02-25T01:57Z,Nero? Nero the burning cd thingy or?? could you link   the site where its possible to download Nero. thanks.

,pikkie001,2009-04-26T11:19Z,"Thanks very much for this torrent.

If you're running Vista-64 like me, you will have problems running / installing some of the games ofcourse(!).
The DOS-based ones I got running in DOSbox. Others work fine with 'compatibility-mode' set to win98 res. 640x480.
For the ones running a 16-bit installation, I came up with the following solution: I install the game in my WinXP partition, and simply run the game from my Vista-partition. Done this for several programs like this, works almost allways.

But then again... You don't really have to HAVE them ALL running, do you?
Check out the 3D ultra pinball torrents on TPB.. Also very nice pinball-games."
,Axeman1919,2009-06-18T23:11Z,"Thanks for the great collection of PinBall games.  :)

'hansjovis' made a post stating that he found a virus in DARE DEVIL PINBALL, my anti-virus didn't find one there but my Nod32 did find a '''class.exe - Win32/Agent.ONQ trojan''' in Devils Island Pinball.rar

Thanks again for the games."

Austin Powers pinball graphics are totally messed up on Windows 7 and I have tried many compatiable modes but nothing works. Judge Dredd Pinball won't install for me. That is just the start. I hope at least one game installs, displays and works properly!"
,tbraybrook,2011-10-07T07:06Z,"WTF!? 
Don't waste your time on this torrent!!
None of these games seem to work on Windows 7. Tried and tried with what is an odd installation of the Tombstone one and no way that will work. Tried to get the Star Trek one and another to UNZIP but WinZip pro keeps encountering error after error. NOT WORTH THE TIME TO TRY THIS ONE! "
