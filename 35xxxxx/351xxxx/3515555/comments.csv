,X-piraten,2006-08-24T02:25Z,nån seedar denna?
,ncheckoway,2006-08-24T02:32Z,"Yes, this is being seeded.  Not sure why the tracker isn't showing this...  I've had a similar problem with another torrent I uploaded, ""The Music of Chance"" located at http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3510017/The_Music_of_Chance.  It's been downloaded many, many times, but the tracker is still showing 0, 0, 0."
,teckla3,2006-08-24T11:19Z,"951Mb...är inte denna på fel avdelning..Tyvärr är ju många lagda här som hör hemma innom Video-film, INTE DVD-R"
,Temptation,2006-08-25T02:15Z,thanks for this.. been wanting to watch this ever since I heard about it way back when.
,Temptation,2006-08-26T11:48Z,"Just finished watching this and wanted to thank you again.  This was indeed an excellent film.  Great acting, great story, great direction, and great music.  I enjoyed it very much.  Thank you for giving me the opportunity to watch this."
,Temptation,2006-08-26T11:49Z,"Just so you know, though, this is a rather poor rip.  I am not complaining about something I got for free, and I was able to enjoy the film as I'm not overly fussy and the qualitiy isn't that bad that it can't be watched.. at least, for me, it was good enough to watch.. just not good enough to save.

I'm no expert at ripping myself, but I think you should know certain basic things when making a DVD rip.  I hope you will take the following suggestions in a positive way.  They are meant as polite constructive criticism for future rips you might make and share here:"
,Temptation,2006-08-26T11:51Z,"1) The audio quality is poor, i.e., 56 kb/s at 24000 Hz.  I don't understand why you would rip at such a low quality unless you're trying to cut the file length because the movie is 2 hours long.. but the file size is already at 950MB.. so what's the point in cutting corners with the audio?  It's not going to save you too much to have proper audio, which should be at least 128 kb/s and at the standard 48000 Hz.  Audio data isn't very expensive in terms of size."
,Temptation,2006-08-26T11:51Z,"2) This rip has artifacts, i.e., those horizontal lines throughout the movie.  This is a major problem.  Are you aware of the need to deinterlace when you rip from NTSC DVD that is at 29.97 fps, and which has artifacts?  Also, the 29.97 fps needs to be converted to the standard rate for film, i.e, 23.97 fps, through a process called inverse telecine, i.e., IVTC."
,Temptation,2006-08-26T11:57Z,"test. sorry for splitting my comments, but f*cking Pirtae Bay is giving me database errors because my comment was too long... so i had to split my comment into multiple ones."
,Temptation,2006-08-26T12:01Z,"3) You have ripped at the original DVD NTSC resolution of 720x480.  This is not only unnecessarily wasteful, but the aspect ratio is incorrect."
,Temptation,2006-08-26T12:02Z,"(point 3 continued) Usually, it is a good idea to resize the horizontal resolution to something like 640, and then resize the y resolution appropriately to get the correct aspect ratio.  I know this rip is still widescreen, but this rip has a bad aspect ratio.  If you look carefully, you will see the image is squeezed horizontally.  This is usually corrected by a step whereby you resize the image when you create a rip."
,Temptation,2006-08-26T12:05Z,"4) Are you aware of what cropping is? Again, referring to the point above, you have ripped this at the original DVD NTSC resolution of 720x480, which also includes the black bars! "
,Temptation,2006-08-26T12:05Z,"(point 4 continued) Usually, those black bars are removed when creating a rip in a process called ""cropping"".  There is no reason whatoever to waste valuable bytes just to encode black bars.  Black bars are automatically added by the media player.  So your rip could have saved a lot of bytes through the cropping step, and those valuable byes could have reduced the file size, or could have been put to better use by increasing the video bittrate of the actual image, or by increasing the audio quality."
,Temptation,2006-08-26T12:08Z,"If all the above sounds foreign to you, I recommend you visit the following sites that have some excellent guides and suggestions on how to create proper DVD rips:"
,Temptation,2006-08-26T12:08Z,"1) http://www.afterdawn.com
2) http://www.rita.lt/index.htm

You should also check out the easy to use tool AUTO GK, which can be used to create excellent quality rips without having to worry about the details I mentioned above.  "
,Temptation,2006-08-26T12:12Z,"Anyway, I hope that helps.  

And fuck Pirate Bay and its annoying database error that refuses to let me write a long comment!"
,ncheckoway,2006-08-27T01:06Z,"Temptation:

1) Thanks for the feedback.  Just FYI, I had a helluva time ripping this film directly from the DVD.  My attempts to rip using IMTOO Premium (the tool I typically use without many problems) could not yield an Xvid or DivX rip without serious audio sync problems.  Soooo...
"
,ncheckoway,2006-08-27T01:07Z,"Temptation

2) ...because I wanted to get this film out into torrentville (I had searched for it for over 2 years), I took the original mpeg, loaded into Virtualdub and transcoded it (converting to MP3).  I know the quality is not typically what I have been able to produce, but I thought that it was important that a film of this caliber be put into wide viewership and that I would attempt to produce a much cleaner rip or even a full DVD copy in time.

Hope this helps to explain some of the shortcomings of the current rip."
,R2/D2,2006-09-28T20:01Z,"Hi, ncheckoway. How about uploading the entire DVD? At least I would appreciate it very, very much."
