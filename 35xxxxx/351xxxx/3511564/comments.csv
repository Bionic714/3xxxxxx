Do you eguys even know how much time its taking, he is spending hes own freetime to be able to give this to you. Enjoy it instead. I really appriciate your releases axxo :) keep up the good work"

,Harry Q Hammer,2008-04-06T11:38Z,"@ etropx
Turtle9's comment was constructive, not whiney.  Don't appoint yourself TPB's resident thought-police!

@ Turtle9
A common outcome of highly compressing video is that low contrast scenes (ie: night shots) are poorly reproduced.

You may do better if you crank up your monitor's brightness and contrast.  Otherwise you will need to download a less compressed (ie: bigger file size) copy of the movie.

This movie apparently even has a decent budget, so that is no excuse. I think one, no one read the damn script, 2 they hired some music video director who has no business directing something with a narrative and 3 what is the damn point? Maybe such bs logic is okay in a video game, but a movie. Please...."
