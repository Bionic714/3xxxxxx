,webrosc,2006-09-06T01:47Z,"here's the quick methods of playing copied PS2 games, instead of downloading this, 
1. get a mod chip.
2. buy swap magic.
3. buy HD Advance/USB Advance"
[V],exion2,2006-09-06T15:01Z,"HD Advance works great for me, no mod, no swap. 200gb Harddrive connectiong to lan and play all you want ... perfect. Even my orginal games loads extremly fast, no loooooong loading times .... "
,lap87,2006-09-07T20:20Z,i love my DMS3 soo much! 
,sdh,2006-09-08T09:02Z,once a friend of mine farted so a piece of poo came out.
,dj robbe,2006-09-11T14:26Z,"I have DMS4 Pro works perfectly for me.. 
just download burn and play ;)"
,n4516,2006-10-01T08:23Z,"re:webrosc
you forgot method #4:
If your fortunate enough to own a version 9 or less ps2 you can use the memory card exploit to load one of the later patched HD Loader versions from your memory card (runs a lot more games than hd advance)
works great. search (with google) for: 'ps2 exploit' and you'll find plenty on how"
,3d recon,2006-11-05T02:49Z,why dont you rather search for kylie minouges greatest hits.. this ps2 is old bullshit...fkn go out n buy a 360 or sumthin
,phoenixflame,2006-11-05T13:11Z,probably cos the 360 is crap
[V],distrea,2006-12-23T16:35Z,dette forsto jeg ikke stort av... noen som gjĂ¸r det? hjeeeeeelp :-)
,erik400,2006-12-23T20:55Z,plzzz help me how can i play this game without a  modchip is it just to burn it to a dvd rom or hvat plzzz help
,Wolfi,2007-01-17T19:29Z,"you fucking noob, you want to steal games, but you want it to be easy, done by others and free. You should really go buy a modchip, or find a guy with one to get the ps1 exploit."
,jennysalala,2007-01-20T19:07Z,"OMFG. I keep seeing the same idiots posting over and over again. YOU CANNOT PLAY ONLINE OR ON LAN FOR THAT MATTER ON YOUR HDD UNLESS YOU HAVE A MODIFIED SMAP.IRX.

n4516 isn't an idiot at all but just to point out v10 can also have the ps1 exploit.

YOU DO NOT NEED A CHIP TO GET THE PS1 EXPLOIT. GO BUY ARMAX, CODEBREAKER, GAMESHARK AND MAKE A SAVEGAME EXPLOIT. 

DO SOME RESEARCH BEFORE YOU COMMENT BULLSHiT."
,petvirus,2007-01-28T06:40Z,"Involves BUYING GameShark, and then dissembling your PS2 so you can forcibly remove the GS disk and replace it with your burned disk...bad for the drive tray motor, and if you have to buy GS, why not just by the modchip and get these benefits without damaging your PS2??  Waste of time!"
,Soul6ess,2007-01-29T23:56Z,"Jenny&Wolfi, maybe if you two would stop acting like cunts, and help the people who need it, they would stop asking the same questions over and over...  

Dont get a mod-chip if you dont know what you are doing, just get magic swap.. its 34 bucks and works great.. If your a kid ask your parents im sure they would say yes, since they would save money on buying you games..  "

,mr_yeah,2007-05-23T07:47Z,"the only thing that you have to buy , its a modchip , you don't have to buy swap magic or something , get alcohol 120 % and nothing more!"
,suulan,2007-06-28T15:55Z,You just have to buy USB Extreme or HD advance and a Hard drive. Then you can play allmost all PS2 games without a modchip.
,Knyte6426,2007-07-17T23:06Z,"There is one more way you didn't list. Swap Magic. For the same price you would pay for a gameshark at the local Gamestop you can order the Swap Magics disc with ""Tray/Door Tricking"" tools.

I have it for the older LARGE PS2, but since that died, I now have a Slim model, and I have the USB Xtreme HD on it's way."
,Painter21,2007-09-28T03:26Z,Where can I get a chip from?
,jasonbir,2007-11-23T04:08Z,"search craigslist, I paid $60 for mine, price of 1 game! I can play jap DDR too :D:D:D"
,ZodiacKillerSFPD,2007-12-01T04:44Z,"if in new york city, chinatown is the place to find shady shit like this

40 to get your ps2 modded, you bring it they mod it you pay"
,Patkaa30,2007-12-19T11:41Z,This site here talks about copying ps2 games http://copy-ps2-games-software.blogspot.com/
,Altair77,2007-12-24T17:06Z,"im a bit of a noob but i have a question myself

now is there anything else i need? "
,jmartin3233,2008-02-10T13:09Z,does anyone here know about memor32? does it work?
,McM1337,2008-03-12T10:26Z,"@ Asudragon

Your problem is probably a corrupt/broken ISO. Which game are you trying to run?"
,MotoX86,2008-03-19T00:03Z,Does Action Replay work too or is it just Gameshark?
,xbomb,2008-06-12T19:34Z,memor32 works great.
,regivel,2008-08-29T18:10Z,"Im new to this ps2 torrent. i have a ps2 from united states the thin version and have it modified here in the philippines. installed a chip dunno whats the name of thats chip they installed on my ps2. the reason we modified the ps2 here in the philippines because the original ps2 games so freaking expensive it cause the same in US dollar if you convert the price of original ps2 games here in the philippines. in other words i modified my ps2 so i can buy pirated ps2 games here and i was able to play all the pirated ps2 games. yup whenever theres a new ps2 games release in the US, there will be a pirated version of that games here in the philippines. it only cost 1500 pesos for modifiying the ps2 unit. i have both the thicker ps2 and thinner ps2 modified. new ps2 game cost $50 the pirated games here in the philippines cost 70 pesos. thats like $1.50 if you convert it."
,wontgetfooledagain1,2009-02-01T16:34Z,"Maybe you should write a guide on how to make yr. PS2 work, period."
