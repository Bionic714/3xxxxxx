Who expects a music DVD here I must disappoint that one.

This Doku tells the biography of Farok Bulsara to that one later to Freddie Mercury should become. Freddies mother Jer, Freddie Schwester Kashmira, classmates from India, musician colleagues, Queenmitglieder and further friends come to word in this case from Freddie.
The telling-style does not correspond to the typical, American glorification style, but it is very einfuehlsam and reserved; Dolezal and Rossacher are also Austrians and no Americans.

One receives this DVD only in the "Freddie Mercury Solo Collection" which contains 10 CDs and 2 DVDs. With this box one holds the complete life's work, excluding the Queen collaboration, in hands....


.... and so that everything is complete I have both DVD's geuppt.
