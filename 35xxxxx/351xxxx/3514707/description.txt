Radical Austrianism, Radical Libertarianism: A Steven Berger Seminar

In this ten-lecture seminar, the roots and reach of both Libertarian and Austrian theory are covered by a leading authority: Professor Walter Block of Loyola University, New Orleans. The economic theory is value free, deriving from relentless deductions from first axioms, but it takes flight when combined with a theory of natural rights in the Thomist-Rothbardian tradition. Professor Block is qualified to present the full package as you have never heard it; he is perhaps the most well published of any author writing within the Austro-libertarian tradition.
