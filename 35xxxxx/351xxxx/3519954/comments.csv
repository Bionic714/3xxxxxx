,ph0en1xs,2006-09-06T02:12Z,"here is something,but i dont know if it works!

first i have download bf2 from torrent and tried to use the vitaly key gen.but it did not work....suprise.

after that i have bought the game with a working online key.patched it to 1.3(full patch!).

but when i have tried to start a onlinegame with the new key they said to me it is not a ""validate key"".

sounds fishy

i go to the ea homepage to find a solution.

its from the ea-faq:

if the messege is shown:

""cd-key in use""

-edit the windows registry

go to ""start"" -> ""run""

enter ""regedit""

goto:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE \ SOFTWARE \ Electronic Arts \ EA Games \ Battlefield2 \ ergc

(at this moment if registred that bf2 have not create the folder ""ergc""

because of that my cd-key is not ""valid"" because he was not created at the installation or was deleted as i have patched the game)

-create a folder named ""ergc"" and insert your key without ""-""

if this will not work then try to insert this ""x9392""

and then write your key behind this(big and without ""-"" ->like this:""x9392YOURONLINEKEY""

ea say that this solute the problem with the message ""cd-key in use"" AND with the message

""invalidate cd-key""!!!!!!!

maybee it work also with generated keys.

go to ea homepage:bf2 faq's to read it again

there is also a tool called ""BF2SF_Key_Repair_1.0.0.4""

cause the 1.3 patch sometimes damage the online-key and other values at the registry.

try and error method.

good luck to everyone.....

see you all on the battlefield

somthing to explain!!!

goto:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE \ SOFTWARE \ Electronic Arts \ EA Games \ Battlefield2 \ ergc

at the ""ergc"" folder is your cd-key stored

normaly uncrypted with big letters and without the ""-"" signs

if you run e.g. the 1.3 patch the key will also be crypted.when the key is crypted the five first letters look like this:x9392.......

i tried to run the game with both versions of the key(crypted and uncrypted)

first it only works with the crypted key what is (i think) impossible,but i was online!!!!

now i play with the uncrypted.

on ranked servers!!!!"
