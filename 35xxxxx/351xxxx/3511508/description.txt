vBulletin 3.6.0

The vBulletin team is proud to present vBulletin 3.6.0 Gold.

vBulletin 3.6.0 is now our stable, fully supported version, superseding both 3.0.x and 3.5.x. While we will continue to support 3.0.x and 3.5.x with security and critical bug fixes, these lines are no longer in active development.

Many visitors to this forum will have been keeping tabs on the 3.6 beta and release-candidate versions that have been available for the past several weeks and will be familiar with what is new and improved in vBulletin 3.6. For those who have not seen what you can expect, there is a thread available here for your benefit.

What is a 'Gold' Version?

The term 'gold' in software terms has nothing to do with the color of the application. It refers to the practise of burning the final version of software to a gold CD-R in preparation for the manufacture of CDs for sale and distribution to customers, and is used to indicate that the code is finished. The official name of this new version is vBulletin 3.6.0.
