Mounting ->

similar to cracking, putting downloaded image in virtual CD/DVD-ROM using programs like Daemon Tools, Alkohol 120% etc.

U make it first clicking on daemon red or green lightning next to your clock down to the right, then...
Virtual CD/DVD-ROM -> Device {C,D,Q,Z or any other letter} -> Mount image

Then you just choose image u want to mount..usually image is file with *.iso,*.mdf,*.rar or sometimes any other
