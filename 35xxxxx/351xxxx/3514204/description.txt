78 min. + 2 hours of special features- Piece By Piece is an excellent DVD documenting 20 years of San Francisco?s graffiti. It features interviews with a lot of SF graffiti artists, including Revok, Saber, Giant, Norm, Cycle, Grey and many others. The main feature is 78 minutes long and you also get 2 FULL HOURS of special features, including live painting, more interviews, 500 SF graff pictures slideshow... And if it's not enough, it comes with a 50+ page booklet with extra interviews and flix! Definitely one of our strongest recommendation to date.
