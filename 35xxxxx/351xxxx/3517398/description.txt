Computers can slow down over time, and disk fragmentation is generally one of the causes. Fragmented files are broken up and stored on various parts of your disk causing slowdowns, crashes, and slow boot times. The new Diskeeper 10 keeps your PCs and servers running as fast as they did when they were new. You'll have no more time-consuming manual defragmentation jobs. Just install Diskeeper 10, then "Set It and Forget It". The program uses a high-speed, thorough defragmentation engine that runs unnoticed in the background, eliminating fragmentation while your PCs and servers are in use.
