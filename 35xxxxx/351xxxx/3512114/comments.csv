Hexen ... top effort mate !"
,olivernorwellhardy,2007-11-11T18:27Z,any chance for a re-seed? thanks
,Drowlord,2008-01-09T20:29Z,"TPB deleted a few of these Hexen-NI Laurel and Hardy torrents because of outdated trackers and external tracker urls in the torrent.  I have found them all on other tracker sites, and attempted to correct them for posting on TPB.  However, I thought I knew how to do that, but when I tried it it appeared that I would have to remove trackers that contained active seeds and I didn't want to create a gimpy torrent.  So... I created a torrent filled with all of Hexen-NI's torrents.  Kinda lame, I Know.  Here it is: http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3969220/Laurel_and_Hardy_DVD_Vol_1-21_Torrents_by_Hexen-NI

Also... I've ripped all of these DVD's to XviD, and I'll post a torrent with these soon (when my seeding capacity isn't saturated by all these ISO's)"
,Drowlord,2008-02-10T18:32Z,"As promised, the entire collection's DVD Rips in XviD format: http://thepiratebay.org/tor/4021071/Laurel_and_Hardy_Movies_-_DVDRips_-_142_Movies"
