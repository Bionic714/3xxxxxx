From the Preface:
.
As the Romans were fond of telling their heroes: ?Sic transit gloria mundi.? This (worldly) glory passes. Roman history proves it.
.
Rome is not alone, ancient Egypt, Babylon, Greece, Persia, all have found: Gloria transit. 
.
Rome had its come-uppance. So did Egypt, Greece, Persia and the rest. Some say America is due for a comeuppance. Are we witnessing it today? Unless you are totally blind or live on a desert is-land, the answer is clearly: yes. 
.
Unwilling as I am to come to terms with the come-uppance, I find it as inevitable as the next sunset.
