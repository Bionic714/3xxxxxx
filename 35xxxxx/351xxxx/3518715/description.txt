Lectures by Srila A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada on Bhagavad Gita, Srimad Bhagavatam, Chaitanya, lectures, morning walks, japa, etc.  Transcendental Knowledge is passed from the lips of a pure Vaisnava devotee through disciplic succession to your ears.  Prabhupada brought the Hare Krishna Movement from India to North America where it spread to Europe, South America, Asia, and Africa and now to your home.  Enjoy transcendental bliss and may you always have Krishna's mercy.
