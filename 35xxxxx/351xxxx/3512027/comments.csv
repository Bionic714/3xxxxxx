,VOLVO_245,2006-08-13T10:16Z,are there an swe subs??
,enije,2006-08-13T10:44Z,No seed...?
,chossein,2006-08-13T16:50Z,"Sorry should be seeding now g/F shut down the CPU.  

The only subs are the ones I listed above is texted langs.  To be honest with you guys here in North America I have never seen a DVD with Swead subs.  So from here forward assume none of the uploads I post have swead subs.

Ciao"
,chossein,2006-08-13T22:43Z,Come on guys this is not right try and keep bit torrents alive.  I have 69 peers connected and 0 seeding.  Please open up the share for this once I hit 100% I am stopping my sharing so a lot of you will be left with partial d/ls
,shoggoth,2006-08-14T12:20Z,I'll help you with the seeding as soon as possible!
,enije,2006-08-14T15:42Z,You are stopping your seeding after 1 day... Come on... I seed my torrents for at least 1-2 weeks... What a rip off..... :(
,shoggoth,2006-08-14T16:46Z,Yes.. This won't do... Why upload a torrent if you don't plan to be the main uploader?! Stick to downloading in the future!
,chossein,2006-08-14T23:10Z,"Hy guys relax,  I said I let it seed 1 week after it reaches 100%.  "
,chossein,2006-08-14T23:17Z,shoggoth thanks for saying you will help seed once your % gets high enough.  Wondering why you are suggesting I only d/l from now on not upload?  This was a rental that I took the time to copy for everyone to share. 
,shoggoth,2006-08-14T23:40Z,"Was thinking of ""I am stopping my sharing so a lot of you will be left with partial d/ls"". Sounded a bit strange if you would stop seeding, and the fact was that the torrent was stuck. But if you're seeding then I beg your pardon!"
,chossein,2006-08-17T14:39Z,Ok now what are people going to say? 20+ ppl have d/l the full DVD and I have 0 person(s) seeding on my end.  Wow this is the very reason I left my comment before.  This is what will make most stop their u/l after it hits 100%.
,doug2004,2006-08-20T18:17Z,it is a shame people do not seed torrents after they are upped  with no speed
,The Soft Touch,2006-08-21T22:16Z,"DAMN.... Been stuck on 72.9 % for long now. Why wont anyone seed????? 
Its FREE, so share the damn movie......"
,enije,2006-08-24T08:22Z,"Fuck this film... It obviously isn´t going anywhere... Newcomers - don´t download this torrent, nobody is seeding it.... We are about 50 people stuck at 79, 5 %....
If anybody actually downloaded the whole thing but didn´t share  - remember the same thing can happen to you... I´m deleting.... :("
,chossein,2006-08-24T16:07Z,"My god I can't understand that?  I was away for 1 week so I closed my cpy down, but I know at least 20-30 ppl got the movie and that was my point no one is sharing.  Damn shame.  Well I'm back and it's running."
,Aggressor01,2006-08-27T01:39Z,"Where the F*** is all the seeders! Im stuck at 98.1%. Been like this the whole week. Im not blaming chossein, but all the other 20-30 who just leeched."
,doug2004,2006-08-27T06:49Z,they dont beleive in sharig you get a seeder for 10 or 15 then they are gone
