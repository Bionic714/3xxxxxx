3.If you haven't Winrar then download it seek on Googel.

4. Mabie the files you have downloaded isen't winrar so you can extract it, then rename all files that have 001, 002, 003 
and so on in the end if the name RENAME THEM TO: r01, r02, r03 and so. Just take off the 0 and replace with r.

5. Now when the files is rar you can extract the files, Take the first winrar file and right click and click extract hear.

6. Now you got a big file that are more then 200 mb. Now open the big file with MagicISO (when it come up thing just click ""Try it"".
Now seek up the buttom named extract and click on it, extract it in the same map you have downloaded the game ex: The sims 2 Glamour life stuff

7. Now you must have a file named AutoRun. Click on it and then it open the file. Then folow what is stand.

8. Then you put the serial key: Q4LU-35BZ-Y1Z8-50B8-1911

9. So now put the NO-CD crack ex: Sims2SP2 and file like that in /Pogram/EA GAMES/The sims 2 Glamour Life Stuff /TSBin and replace
the old one with the NO-CD crack.

Keygen is infected with Trojan.Horse.Backdoor.Hupigon5.NOP

,XOmikaaXO,2011-11-06T10:46Z,Tnx!! 
,labellavienna,2012-03-02T05:46Z,"Actually, after trying for half an hour I finally got it to work...let me explain in a detailed and coherent way (this method takes a while but it works I guarantee it!):

1. There are 22 files total that you need to extract...this does not include the SFV file and the system info. file, ignore those. 

2. Create a folder on your desktop called ""Bella""

3. Back to the Glamour Life folder you just torrented: GO TO the very first file at the top, this is the 001 file and should be the very first file. 

4. Right click on that and press open, if the option is not available then click ""open with"". Choose the program WinRAR. This will open up a folder that includes 2 things. A BIN and a CUE file. 

5. Copy those two files and paste it into your ""Bella"" folder.

6. Do this EXACT same thing with the rest of the 21 remaining files. Open each one individually and copy then paste into your Bella folder. IT WILL ASK YOU TO OVERWRITE EXISTING FILES each time...CLICK YES and let them overwrite. Don't worry....I know it sounds weird but it works!

7. After everything is done (there should only be 2 files in your Bella folder...the CUE file and the Bin file) mount the CUE file with Daemon Tools and enjoy!!!

*Hope this helps!*

,kerstinr,2012-03-15T15:24Z,"Hey guys :)! Um, I actually registered here on PirateBay partly to become an official member, but mainly because I want to let all those who are worried about downloading a torrent file just in case there is a virus. I want to do this, because I was worried this file might have a virus too.

ANYWAY. 

I've downloaded AND installed this torrent SUCCESSFULLY. For those who are worried about downloading this file because there could be a virus hidden, I assure you - THERE IS NO VIRUS. The file is completely safe, and your computer will not be in any danger. As said above, I've downloaded and installed this torrents along with my other expansion and stuff packs, and there seems to be NO PROBLEM AT ALL.

I promise you, there is no actual virus. It may show up as a trojan detected by your Anti-virus program, but this torrent has no virus trojan/virus.

WHY DOES IT SHOW UP AS A VIRUS?
The Razor1911 release is not a trojan/virus. Many of the ""pirated"" keygens and cracks contain code fragments that may trigger antivirus software into thinking there is something wrong. Most of the time, you are safe. "
