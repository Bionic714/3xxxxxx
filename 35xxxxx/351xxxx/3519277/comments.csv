This is high level of betatesting!
What went better in this build?
Where do we report bugs?"
,GasGiver4711,2006-09-04T21:01Z,"gigante1: 
what exactly do u mean with ""savegames dont work"" ?
cant reproduce problems with jpg viewing, works for me (can ne1 confirm ?)
BetaTesting is ALL about finding BUGS ;-)
read the changelog yourself, dammit

You should post Bugs here (NO Script related Bugs !) : http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?atid=581838&group_id=87054&func=browse "
,mark429,2006-09-05T05:02Z,Gasgiver- I love your releases plus you save me the irc/ftp hassle... Thanks for all the hard work you do!!
,Sanctos,2006-09-05T16:09Z,i.. dont understand how to get it to work =(
,0rr,2006-09-06T00:24Z,"Props from me, too, Gas. I've been trying several XBMC's and you're the man. Your version was a little slow before (had the BLING BLING edition before) which ran a lot faster but since August you've put some speed in your program which I appreciate very much. And since you've implemented the nifty little scripts, you're the man. I love it."
,0rr,2006-09-06T00:27Z,"I forgot, your XBMC is moz def the best out there (judging from the other releases I tried). "
,GasGiver4711,2006-09-06T01:26Z,"0rr + ALL : Thanks m8 !
Don´t forget, all XBMC Versions are based on the exact same source code ;-) We all just compile and some of us add some extra stuff . So, again, all versions share the same codebase - so its basically impossible that they differ in speed.
One thing comes to my mind : What maybe makes the GasGiver Releases sometimes look slow to you, is the Massive Milkdrop Megapack. If you enable this (depending on your HDD Speed, too) starting the Milkdrop Vis takes ´some time´ to load. If you dont like this, try a Milkdrop Vis Pack with less Presets, like e.g. BritneysPairs - it contains a small fraction of the Megapacks Visualization Presets, so it gets loaded WAY! faster than the MegaPack ..."
,GasGiver4711,2006-09-06T01:30Z,... and yes ... that is the exact reason why the Milkdrop Megapack is not the default MilkDrop Preset anymore ;-)
,Sanctos,2006-09-06T12:06Z,"can someone make a point list of how to make this work, and even better.. make one in swedish"

,0rr,2006-09-09T01:19Z,Gas: I don't know why the previous releases were smaller. It makes sense if you say that they are based on the same source code and you changed to another preset pack. Maybe it was just that. =)
