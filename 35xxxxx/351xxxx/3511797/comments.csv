,jimtick,2006-08-12T14:40Z,"Hmm, it will no register my seeding for some reason. This is the first time i'm using TPB to seed a  torrent, although i've successfully seeded using other trackers"
,krutan,2006-08-12T17:22Z,"Try downloading your own upload, it might start seeding then"
,jimtick,2006-08-13T03:01Z,"It seems to be okay now. I apologize for the slow seed speed, but it's all I've got

Don't worry i'll keep seeding!"
,jimtick,2006-08-13T12:11Z,"Upload speed from me is now around 5-10K/sec, and there are currently around 26 peers who are all at ~10% downloaded.

So it's working and there are both 1 seeder and 26 peers, even if TPB doesn't show that"
,jimtick,2006-08-14T19:21Z,"Still seeding.
It still doesn't show here on TPB. 26 peers connected and 1 seeder (me). Upload is around 10 K/sec and availability is around 1.5 or so

Please help me seed this one, when you have the whole file, since my own upload is so slow"
,jimtick,2006-08-14T19:22Z,"BTW I'm using utorrent which also supports DHT (trackerless) - that should give us a little extra speed/availability

most peers have around 50-52% already"
,jimtick,2006-08-15T22:36Z,"45 peers, most of them at 93%. UL speed is around 8-10 kbit/s"
,jimtick,2006-08-18T08:35Z,"It seems like everybody is done and no-one is helping me to seed. 
I'm going to stop seeding, since there is no-one downloading anymore I declare this torrent DEAD"
,jimtick,2006-08-18T08:39Z,"Hmm, i just tried dl'ing myself on another coneection and i see several peers. Maybe my seed died for some reason. I'll restart my seeder machine, so you ppl can get the last bits!"
,jimtick,2006-08-18T08:44Z,"Yes, that helped. 
I apologize! My seeder had stopped for some reason :(

It's now running smoothly (but still slowly). UL speed i sright now around 20-30 K/sec and there are 36 peers and 0 seeders"
,moxie,2006-08-18T10:26Z,Excellent! Slowly getting there is better than not getting there at all :-) Ta lots for this.
,moxie,2006-08-18T11:19Z,Are you still on? Me and a few others are hanging on 99% :-/
,jimtick,2006-08-20T11:24Z,"Yes, I',m still seeding. There only 6 peers now and the speed lousy, around 3k/sec :(

I don't why it's this slow. I'm not running muvh else really. ANyway, just hang in there"
,jimtick,2006-08-21T23:10Z,"I'm still seeding, but no-one is helping me seed. We have seven peers and UL speed is around 13 k/sec"
,jimtick,2006-09-18T07:28Z,"I'm going to stop seeding now.
If you request it, i can reseed it later"
,burzum4life,2007-06-16T10:49Z,"someone plz seed! im only getting .01 or .02 Kb/s, and I really like this show"
,ialdabaoth,2007-10-09T07:10Z,Seed Plz! Getting only 1kbps right now...
,njalldur,2007-11-18T18:51Z,"Please re-seed,, I can seed at 200mps as soon as I've got it."
,Doc Lithius,2007-11-25T16:12Z,"I just LOVE how on the episode, ""The Egg Beater"", I can hear the microphone input from whomever recorded the episode.  Around 19:07.75, I get to hear this vaugely creepy chuckle, for example.

In any case, all seems to be in order, here.  13 out of 24 total episodes isn't a bad haul in the least.  They're of standard VHS quality, no big deal for most people.  30 frames per second, mono sound, slightly fuzzy picture.  My personal favorite episode of this batch is ""Opposites Attack"" in which Evil Jim ([1x05] ""Conquerer Worm"") creates evil opposited doubles of Princess What's-Her-Name and Peter Puppy.  ""We now interrupt Earthworm Jim for three seconds of dancing turtles.""  I think that statement says it all.  :D

Anyway, as I said, that one episode was apparently using Mic-In or perhaps ""All-In""/""What U Hear"" and is a little quieter than other episodes, but the other episodes are probably alright."
,Doc Lithius,2007-11-25T16:46Z,"I'd also like to note that ""Darwin's Nightmare"" has some strange subtitles on it.  The subtitles look German, but I can't get any sort of translation for them, so I have no idea what they are...  They continually refer to something called ""Splatangreb"", though.  It's definately North Germanic.  Possibly Swedish or Danish...  I dunno.  Really weird..."

,Trantor11,2007-12-09T01:16Z,Reseeding... thanks for posting this. It's been hard to find anywhere.
,Johntheman,2007-12-29T08:10Z,"Every single episode can be found on youtube, just type in the name of the episode (found on wikipedia) and there are usually 2 parts to the episode. "

,DevinBedari,2008-03-12T03:39Z,"Those of you who are seeding, THANXALOT. Those of you who have an unlimited cap limit, but don't seed, FuckYou"
,arestice,2008-07-16T05:54Z,"Thanks jimtick, I haven't seen this show in YEARS. =]"
,Mur4hl,2008-07-20T22:11Z,"Hey Jimtick!

This rocks man, i still remember the series as a kid :) They were so great!
Im at 4% now, and i've decided to try to let the comp stay on for the night. Is there any chance that u could lend me ur email or MSN? I really want to know more about the series, and maybe u could help me out with some torrent-stuff aswell. Could be sweet :) Thanks for the upload! I hope i'll have it on my comp soonish! :)"
