A selection of Earthworm Jim episodes. It's a hilarious cartoon that's not aired anymore and impossible to get on DVD, so I've decided to release them here.

Be aware that most of the files are encoded with the old Divx 3.11 codec. You probably need to get VLC Media player in order to play the, it has that codec (and maost others) built-in m - you can get it here:

"The TV show Earthworm Jim is based on a video game by the same name. As in the video game, our main character is Earthworm Jim, an annelid with a power suit. His best friend is Peter Puppy, a scared doggy, but when Peter gets mad... Let's say you do NOT wanna be in the vicinity. His love interest is the "beautiful" (whether she really is or not depends on whether you're a pro or anti) Princess Whats-Her-Name.

The villians are the evil Psycrow (an evil, well, crow.), Evil The Cat (a cat who lives in Heck), Bob & #4 (a goldfish and his very big friend), Queen Pulsating, Bloated, Festering, Sweaty, Pus-Filled, Malformed, Slug-For-A-Butt and others. Our hero must do battle with these creatures, and while he does, he's a master of hilarious quotes."

The video quality of the episodes are not great but they are very enjoyable anyway. They were recorded on VHS tape from TV and later captured to avi with an ATI Radeon videocapture card. Finally they were recompressed using the available tools at the time like virtualdub/nandub and using codecs like divx 3.11, divx 4 and 5.

My connection is not fast as I'm on a regular ADSL and also use for other things. So be very very patient, I will try to keep seeding it for a long while.
