,zploek,2007-04-25T18:55Z,"Oh my God! I am in love with Sara (fraux) !! She is violently beautiful! Raise your hand, guys, who also thinks so!

Anyhoo ...

Good film! Navnen ""Steal this film"" er myke bedre en ""Steal this movie"", which sounds lame

And about the money argument, you know, the ""boohoo, we're all gonna be poor coz of Piratbyran""-thing: I just wanna say this: the studios are making HUGE amounts of money on these films, they can afford to pay stupid people like Tom Cruise not 20 million dollars, not 30 million, not 40 million, but .... 100 million dollars per movie!!!! Let all the script-girls, movie-cutters, coffee-people,  security-people get their money there first before coming cry-babying to us about piracy!

If that industry can lose 18 billion dollars (if you believe them) and is still around, then obviously their complaints are not about their survival but about Valenti's second cousins third yacht .... all fifteen of his cousins!

And firing 250 people from the studios and then complain to us that it is coz of piracy and coz of the 20 million dollars they pay Stallone, Jim Carrey, Cameron Diaz etc. .... it's beyond me. And its HYPOCRITICAL. And it's also time to give back. So much money and power in the hands of a few people (Americans at that .... ;) ) It's no good, and I'm VERY glad that the Pirate-bay is doing something back."
,CsmcDem,2007-09-16T02:54Z,"hey thanks for this movie. i love it! ive seen it like 5 times now. lol. Me and my friends in america, would like to make a movie such like this, just in america. but, we are having some trouble, mainly cause a lot of people in this country know virtually nothing about bittorrent. and use shitty LimeWire. And many people don't even know the word piracy. lol. Long Live P2P!"
,Conformist,2007-09-26T16:52Z,"CsmcDem you're right!
I hate how being a pirate is so fucking mainstream now, I tell them hoes *slap* ''Look bitch! You don't know the first fucking thing about pirating! I spend almost all of my free time pirating and seeding for my pirate family! So next time you start to say you're a fucking pirate, SHUT THE FUCK UP!!''

They all think that pirating is just grungy people on a boat that are 'mean'.
FUCK YOU MAINSTREAM!

Raise the sails!
ThePirateBay sails on forever!
I'll be in Davy Jone's locker before I give into the american government over-charging for music!

LONG LIVE US PIRATES!!"
