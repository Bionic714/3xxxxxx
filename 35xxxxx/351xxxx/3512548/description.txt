Release info: Thea Gilmore returns with a brand new album, 'Harpo's Ghost', on Monday 21st August, her first for two and a half years. Despite being her first release for Sanctuary Records, 'Harpo's Ghost' is the highly prolific singer-songwriter's seventh studio album to date. An amazing acheivement for someone who is still only 26-years-old.

Oxfordshire-born Thea has been compared to everyone from Joni Mitchell to Ryan Adams and Tom Waits and counts Bruce Springsteen, Bob Seager and Martha Wainright amongst her famous fans. Already described as the best British singer-songwriter of the last 10 years, this new album will only help to reinforce that claim.

The first single to be lifted from the album - surely set to be Thea's biggest hit to date - is 'Cheap Trick, which will be released a week earlier on 14th August. Thea is scheduled to perform live at the SWAP Festival in Manchester, which runs from 14-16th July and will then embark on a 12-date tour of the UK from 18th September - 8th October.
