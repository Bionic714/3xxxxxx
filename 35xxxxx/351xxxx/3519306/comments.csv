It's a shame you will lose your fast connection soon though, hope you will stay with us, even with a slower speed."
,Da King,2006-09-04T22:15Z,"Looks like we can finally conquer the Dominon! But what do you mean: loose your internet connection? WHY?!?!?!?! You know something we don't? Is Al Queida (how the hell do you spell that) going to hit you? Or worse: the internet itself? 

Cheers buddy, thanks for making me a happy puppy!"
