,Staple,2006-08-28T15:50Z,I'm not sure what OGG is. Is it possible to watch with the VLC player. And if you want to burn it to a cd is it watchable on a dvd-player compatible for divX and Xvids ?
,WiiFisher,2006-08-30T11:02Z,"OGG (although I though the standard was to use OGM for video) is an open-source ""container"" format much like (but not compatible with) M$' AVI files.  Such a ""container"" may use any of a wide variety of formats for each of the data streams contained therein (e.g. audio and video portions each take up a stream).  From a technical standpoint OGG is a supeior format, but from a user's standpoint AVI is better simply because it is so much more widely supported at this point.  Either way you need the appropriate ""CoDec"" (e.g. DivX/Xvid, AAC, MP3, etc.) to interpret whatever format the individual streams are using.

VLC will most likely support this without a hitch, but you'll need transcoder software to convert it to the very rigid limited formats DVD players support.  Assuming you're on a Winblows box, try either of the following freeware transcoding options:

Glad to see another Linux user here.

We have better video encoders, players and even better bittorrent clients on Linux !
Can you rip more of twilight zone please ?

Thanks"
