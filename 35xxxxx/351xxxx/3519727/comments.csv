,Semptimilius,2007-06-23T01:16Z,"Game Issues With Multiprocessor/Hyperthreading Systems


If you're reading this you probably already know that Thief, Thief Gold, Thief 2, System Shock 2, as well as Grim Fandango don't like multiprocessor/hyperthreading systems.
The non-permanent way to fix this problem is to:

   1. Start the game(go only as far as the menu).
   2. Alt-Tab out of it.
   3. Bring up the task manager(Ctrl-Alt-Del then T).
   4. Click on the processes tab.
   5. Find thief.exe / thief2.exe as well as thief2.icd for thief 2 / grimfandango.exe for Grim Fandango.
   6. Right click on it/them and go to set affinity.
   7. Uncheck one of the cpus.
   8. Alt-Tab back into the game and play. 

This will need to be done every time you start the game as this is not a permanent solution.


The permanent way to fix this problem(without turning off Hyperthreading) is this:

   1. Download imagecfg.
   2. Unzip it to Windows\system32\ as well as Windows\system32\dllcache\.
   3. Make a backup copy of your exe and icd(for Thief 2 and System Shock 2) files.
   4. Open notepad and enter the following for Thief/G:
      imagecfg -u thief.exe
      imagecfg -a 0x1 thief.exe
      pause

      For Thief 2 it's:
      imagecfg -u thief2.exe
      imagecfg -u thief2.icd
      imagecfg -a 0x1 thief2.exe
      imagecfg -a 0x1 thief2.icd
      pause

      For System Shock 2 it's:
      imagecfg -u shock2.exe
      imagecfg -u shock2.icd
      imagecfg -a 0x1 shock2.exe
      imagecfg -a 0x1 shock2.icd
      pause

      For Grim Fandango it's:
      imagecfg -u GRIMFANDANGO.EXE
      imagecfg -a 0x1 GRIMFANDANGO.EXE
      pause
   5. Save the file in the game directory as ""processor.bat"" including the quotes.
   6. Double click the file processor.bat (must be in the game directory). You will see something similar to the following:
      D:\Games\Thief2>imagecfg -u thief2.exe
      thief2.exe contains contains no configuration information
      thief2.exe contains a Subsystem Version of 4.0

      Press any key to continue . . .

6) Right-Click SHOCK2.exe and in the compatibility tab, select Windows 2000
7) Hit apply and off you go!

However, if you have a Dual or Quad-core machine, as soon as the game starts, ALT+TAB out of it and bring up the Task Manager (CTRL+SHIFT+ESC) Right-Click on SHOCK2.exe and select ""Set Affinity"" uncheck all but one CPU and it should work!

After going through various search results....i found a link to a topic on the Nvidia forums regarding SS2.

The reason why this game won't run on many systems (including mine) is because of the architecture of Nvidia 8800 series gfx cards (7 & 9 series also) as well as their drivers. I have an 8800 GT & ForceWare driver 175.16 installed on my system. Even ATi cards suffer from these issues.

System Shock 2 is a ""Dark Engine"" game, its rendering & dithering method is not supported by these modern GPUs & their drivers, the engine also suffers from texture corruption....reason for the game not being able to run. So, it?s a hardware as well as software issue.

Same for you too, I hope you have downloaded

No sound ? Can't see the game cutscenes ? Well I haven't tested things on Win Vista. However as a last resort, try this - 

Go to the directory where u installed the game. Now, remember the DDfix files u copied into there ? Find & open ""ddfix.ini"" using notepad.

You will find a line - 

;Set to 1 to fix the duel core related crash
MultiCoreFix=1

Make sure its set to 1 & not 0

Now the next line-

;Set to 1 to automatically register lgvid.ax each time thief is started up
VideoFix=0

Change the value 0 to 1.

There's also a line which goes as ""Turns on the 32 bit texture loader........"" Make sure the value for that is set to 1 (beside Thief2Extensions)

Finally, when u scroll down to the end, there is a line-

OverlayColourKey=0xf81f

Make sure the value is ""0xf81f"" & not ""0x0000""
Now save the changes & exit. See if the game works."

The only problem I ran into was it crashing at the loading screen, but this is because it gets all frightened and confused when presented with a dual core, so just go to your processes and set the affinity so it's only running on one of the CPU's. Should be fine.

Other than that, I installed everything normally, replaced the .exe for the cracked one and everything was fine."

,MikeDecipher,2009-04-04T13:07Z,"**[Please Help]: I'm not an illiterate when it comes to this stuff.**

(I have Windows XP [Just in case that matters])

-I went through the processes perfectly:

-I used the ISO to install the game.

-I installed the patch.

-I replaced the original Exe with the crack.

(all very simple and easy stuff...)

But when I tried to use the NoCD patch, it doesn't work. It says that it failed.

After that, I went along to the cam.cfg to add the line: ""safe_texture_manager"" (which, by the way, thanks to the person who posted that suggestion...)

**************

The game works perfectly. But I only downloaded it so me and my friend can play online co-op from our different locations... We both have this same problem with the NoCD patch, and when we try to join each other's servers, it says ""connection fail.""

I went along to many different archives to download a different NoCD patches. I considered the notion that perhaps our lack of unique registry (or cracks) is preventing us from playing on each other's servers.

I'm doing so much research and run around to troubleshoot this problem. Any help from this thread will be greatly appreciated."

I'd love to fix it with the crack, but I can't actually find it as this torrent only has one file which is an ISO, and no crack is in the install directory. All of the great directions people have given here aren't much good if a nubcake like me can't find the right files! ^_^'"
,josslynn,2009-04-22T08:12Z,"Ayantae:
try mounting using Daemon Tools, since Power ISO didn't work for me. the CRACK folder appears in the virtual drive. if that still doesn't work, you can even use WinRAR or I believe WinZip to extract the CRACK folder from the .iso file just like you would for a .zip or .rar file."

1. Mount the .iso file with Daemon Tools
2. Full install
3. Open the .iso with PowerISO
4. Run the 2.3 patch
5. Copy the SHOCK2.exe file in the .iso to wherever you installed the game (replacing the installation SHOCK2.exe)
6. Copy the 2.03 NoCD patch and run it (this personally didn't work for me, but I don't know if it had any effect. Run it anyways however).
7. Start playing it, if it doesn't work, switch the compatability mode of the shortcut or SHOCK2.exe file to Windows XP

Hope that clears up and problems and questions.

,Webberjo,2010-10-11T04:58Z,"Installing is so easy, you don't even have to mount the ISO.

1. Download the SS2 torrent.
2. Extract all the files to a new folder on your desktop.
3. Go into the folder when it's done and run ""panel.exe"".
4. Install the game to wherever you like. (I prefer C:\Program Files\System Shock 2)
5. Download this simple patcher. http://www.systemshock.org/index.php?action=dlattach;topic=392.0;attach=3560
6. Run it, and check Patching up and Bug Fixes. If you have a widescreen monitor, check DDfix + WideScreen Mod too.
7. Click Next, then Install, and wait for it to finish.
8. When it asks where to install the Start menu directory, simple erase ""\Games"" from the line and continue. You're now done and free to play!

If you have a widescreen monitor and checked the widescreen box, it will  launch a command prompt asking you to input its dimensions. If you did not, ignore this.
9. Say no you don't want to read the readme, input the horizontal (left right) length of your monitor, the vertical (up down) height of your monitor, and for field of view put in 100. Say yes to all that and you're now done and free to play!

,danii555,2010-12-21T17:44Z,"Ok, here is a guide on how to get it to work on Win7.. Probably works on vista too.

1. Download and install. If you can't install, copy the files in the ""SHOCK"" folder to C:\Sshock2\

2. Install SS2Tool v3.4 (It's a autopatcher, buggfixer and tweaks the game so that it gets better) from http://www.systemshock.org/index.php?topic=392. Choose the options you want, if you don't have a widescreen screen, uncheck the widescreen mod.

3. Now you are ready to play. But if you want better graphics, follow the following steps.

4.Go to http://www.shtupmod.net/files.html and download SHTUP BETA 6.

5. Copy-Paste all the files to your root SS2 folder (C:\Sshock2\).

You are good to go now. If it doesn't start/crashes on startup, run in compatibility mode for Win XP Service pack 3.

Enjoy!"
,danii555,2010-12-21T17:52Z,"Also! If you have a multi-core processor you got to start the task manager, go to SS2:s process, then click processor affinity and uncheck all but one.

And if you can change the resolution in the CAM.cfg
And if the cutscenes don't work add ""safe_texture_manager"" in the CAM.cfg
