Music from the Tea Lands is a collection of music from countries where tea is grown and where it is an essential part of ancient cultural traditions. The companion to 1997's successful Music from the Coffee Lands, Music from the Tea Lands introduces listeners to the rich and exotic music from the Asian continent while providing an aural backdrop for all types of relaxing activities. 
Music from the Tea Lands features readable and informative liner notes giving details on the musical traditions presented plus a recipe for chai, India's flavorful spiced milk tea. The Putumayo website will feature extensive links to resources on Asian music and tea, including artists who appear on this collection, record labels, sources for more music and information on tea history, culture and consumption.
