... cant start the master blaster game though.. well i can start it but not play it, and only way to shut it off is through the ctrl+alt+del hehe"
,imsephiroth,2006-08-23T09:54Z,"well thats the whole point bith blaster master..   u die in the very intro..

and yes right after the relese we realised that one or another of the games could only be shut done by pressing the old fashon way ( Alt+F4 )
in other ways the Esc button is the faitful one."
