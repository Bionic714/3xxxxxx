,killerco,2008-01-15T15:12Z,"i am saying and answer all your questions look here 

if u got a hitachi driver these discs are needed: verbatim or hp's dl discs costs about (swe 230kr) that is about 17-18 dollars i think 

samsung needs: almost evry disc's can be readed in this one.

burn whit clone cd the little .dvd file and the iso will be automaticly founded just do this and u can play burnt games.

p.s  u need too have a firmware too your xbox 360 or a chip a good chip is ixtreame i got it make stealth backups and play online for free i play halo 3 only the real xbox live.

,hogsander,2008-09-20T11:51Z,"Hi i unpacked a file with the name Dr-drisp and open the file 000-file with Windows Media Player. And it says ""To play this game put it in a Xbox 360 console"". And I thinks thats right. But I have two files one DVD-file but when I open that file nothing happends. Should I burn both files to play or just the first one?

Hej jag har packat upp filen DR-Drisp och öppnade filen 000-file med Windows Media Player. Då kommer texten upp ""Snälla sätt in skivan i en Xbox 360 konsol"". Den andra filen DVD-file går inte att öppna med Windows Media Player. Och min fråga är ska jag bränna båda på en disc eller räker den första?"
