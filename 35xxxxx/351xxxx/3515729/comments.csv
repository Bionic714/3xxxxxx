,zploek,2007-04-25T05:13Z,"Oh my God! I am in love with Sara!! She is violently beautiful! Raise your hand, guys, who also thinks so!
Anyhoo ....

Good film! ""Steal this film"" er myke bedre en ""Steal this movie"", which sounds lame

And about the money argument (the ""boohoo we're all gonna be poor coz of Piratbyran""-thing): I just wanna say this: the studios are making HUGE amounts of money on these films, they can afford to pay stupid people like Tom Cruise not 20 million dollars but 100 million dollars per movie!!!! Let all the scriptgirls, moviecutters, coffeepeople, securitypeople get their money there first before coming cry-babying to us about piracy!

If that industry can lose 18 billion dollars (if you believe  them) and is still around, then obviously their complaints are not about their survival but about Valenti's second cousins third yacht .... all fifteen of his cousins! 
And firing 250 people from the studios and then complain to us that it is coz of piracy and coz of the 20 million dollars they pay Stallone, Jim Carrey, Cameron Diaz etc. .... it's beyond me. And its HYPOCRITICAL. And it's also time to give back. So much money and power in the hands of a few people (Americans at that .... ;) ) It's no good, and I'm VERY glad that the Piratebay is doing something back."

Therefore 'movie' sugar ;)"
,TehCho,2007-12-08T12:54Z,"Great torrent, great quality."
,DeeCay85,2007-12-13T17:46Z,One of the many questions that popped into my head while I was watching this movie was: Why are some actors job worth more than my job in a kindergarden? Is their contribution to the society more important than mine?
,mangethegamer,2007-12-15T23:56Z,"Great documentary!!
Piracy will last forever"
,cybercitizen,2007-12-30T21:40Z,Downloading to show support!
,dan6550,2007-12-31T04:38Z,"I'm getting sick and tired of all you motherfuckers slurring Americans when if you were giving the chance you assholes would give anything to live in this great country of mine. 
God bless America"
,vikhr,2008-01-13T13:56Z,I am bit late here..but dan.. overreacted..When people say they hate america..they r not actually refering to the great entrepreneuring and free thinking americans..but those greedy fat ass corporate dickheads who wants to make money out even by selling their own family if they could..admit it people..corp america is the most unscrupulous of all moneybags..a richard branson here or a larry page(google) are exceptions ..comparitively indian moneybags like TATAs are very ethical and conscious of social responsibilities against all odds..

,baboonbob,2008-06-01T13:58Z,"In America, we have very good sewage systems in most places. It doesn't stink when you walk down the street. But most ppl elsewhere are used to the smell and don't notice it. Probably used to a lot of other crappy things they don't notice too. I won't apologize for being born here, and it's not your fault you were born there. I guess we lucked out. "
,upsidedowngiraffe,2008-06-19T23:42Z,"to baboonbob... you have no idea how idiotic you are, a prime example of why people perceive americans to be arrogant bell ends, patriotism is not good for anyone, look up ""tribalism"", then do some thinking."
,baboonbob,2008-07-11T19:10Z,"FREE??? HA!

But who is free to express their opinion without getting jumped on by a gang of thugs?

Here's another one - Thanks to all these movies and songs, we aren't even free to think our own thoughts. It is unnatural for people to be bombarded with so much input from the start of their lives. It was never like this until the past 100 years or so. Now we are like junkies who can't function without the ""stuff"". When was the last time you got in your car without turning on music to shape your emotional state? How do YOU really feel about women? Do you know? Or is the music telling you how you SHOULD feel?

Do you know what you want, or only what you SHOULD want from life? Don't get me wrong, I'm not looking down on anyone. I'm just another leaf being blown around in the windstorm of what one man tries to sell to another man. THAT... is why we have all this in the first place."
,american_no.421,2008-08-01T16:40Z,"Why does everyone have to use thepiratebay.org as a way to spew hate speech about Americans? You know, there are a lot of us who are on your side, politically speaking."
,iamauser,2008-10-05T00:08Z,"Jesus Salad Sandwich! Firstly, the title ""Steal this Movie"" has been taken. It was the movie version of ""Steal this Book"" by one of the Chicago Seven. Which leads nicely in to point two. America is chalk full of radical types that make the whole world better, and they give out of a duty to better the world. It's in our blood. Many of us a the descendants of Europeans that got fed up with your old world. I hate all this anti-somebody else shit. Ignorance is not a national trait. Ignorance is not American/European/Asian/etc.. Me thinking that all Europeans are Socialists, that never ""hit the shower"", and suffer from cowardice in the face of evil(ya, the WW2 thing again), is about the same as others thinking that Americans cant wait to enslave the word and force them to wear Nike/Tommy H./watch mindless blockbuster movies. But really, I dug this movie and it solidified my beliefs that Europeans have really bad haircuts, can't grow a dense beard, shower rarely, and only brush when they shower.     "
,torrentjunky,2009-04-14T19:26Z,"People of the world wake up! It's the democratic dictatorship that will end this world or we have to raise against the true evil from the top. We all  can have a true free world without the money systeem build on technology and resources. There are no shortages in any matter, its the big corporations and the elite who create the shortages only for making profits. This is going on not only in the US but world wide (THE NEW WORLD ORDER) So start deprogramming yourself and see the possibilities. Politicians only make laws they can't solve problems. Check out ZEITGEIST. Maybe you can learn something."
[V],Big_dude,2009-12-21T08:18Z,"Uploading helps to get want we want for free duh, but there are expectations the console games require either a hacked/modded console and some games to be ripped require certain software and hardware/DVD Burners with the right firmware to rip the games, some need patched to. And most software and pc games require some kind of keygen and crack or methods to make them function.

These exceptations are the work and care taken in to get the pirated material to work right.
The challenge and effort to get this stuff uploaded and working is about the main thing that drives people to pirate.

The good quality uploads and the ones that work with instruction minus viruses or malware is golden to the scene because we can't always afford some of that shit. This is the beauty of File Sharing
P2P."
,batty007,2009-12-22T05:09Z,The comments are way better than the movie.
,fruityloop7,2010-04-22T23:31Z,"Thank god copyright laws were invented!!  The world must have been so boring with writers, painters, musicians and filmmakers sitting around unwilling to create anything cus noone had invented copyright laws yet!
As soon as copyright laws were invented all those creative types started making interesting stuff - just so they could earn shit loads of money!!!"
