,rdvenom,2006-08-10T06:01Z,I scanned this with the latest version of mcafee with the latest dat file update and there isn't any trojan or virus.  AVG is crap!
,thegr8ashish,2006-08-10T07:07Z,"crack file is blocked by noton antivirus 2007 Beta permanently. 
can u give me the email address of this 
system identifier :  7A296470 .
can this application shrink a vob file to xvid avi format Plz help"
,y+man,2006-08-10T07:54Z,"Hey rdvenom,If the  other comments made here are true,I owe you an apology.Sorry.When I scanned the file with avg the program told me the file had a virus(trojan downloader)Is anybody else getitng this result with avg?"
[T],DasBot,2006-08-10T09:40Z,Kaspersky is also crap. Hangs during all sort of realtime scanning.
,Cobra631,2006-08-10T09:59Z,"AVG with the latest update says their is a trojan in the crackfile.
Norton with the latest update saysthe same their is a trojan in the crackfile.
Both crap???"
,snuffnews,2006-08-10T13:12Z,"AVG isn´t crap - most Kaspersky or McAfee, already NOD32 security are infected. But i use Symantec Antivirus Client Version, and it helped me some weeks ago to get rid off WinAntivirus was i downloaded from mininova. Every time i touched near the folder of it my PC shut´s down, and i had a traffic log which tells me islamists used my connections to send infos to each other..."
,snuffnews,2006-08-10T13:18Z,"And Yes Symantec found a Filenamed hacktool and cleaned it. I wonder why this file is about 9MB large, the original file is about 1 MB??????
There are many guys around payed by the industry to bring in problem tools denying people to copy their DVDs...like it was years ago in Kazaa etc.....think of it."
,snuffnews,2006-08-10T13:29Z,"Once again: So it was a communication breakdown! DVDshrink is a small program which works perfectly with AnyDVD - it shrinks all DVDs
to DVD5 at best possible quality! But program is illegal in most countries and the official site just shows you a google search to download where...
Conclusion: this DVDshrink includes crap like DVD rebuilder, CCS and Smart ripper....it isn´t DVDshrink which is the best copying tool (Clony DVD is good as well)....."
,brandit1949,2006-08-10T14:26Z,"It works just fine, and it's the best for compressing DVDs, but the CCE encoder are a bit old.
DVDshrink are grainy and not suitable for big screens !"
,snuffnews,2006-08-10T14:49Z,"Dream on bandit, DVDshrink works und looks perfect on on big screens. If you look at special forums you will find exact this conclusions!!!!
Already the question is why posting infected software in here with wrong descriptions?!"
,snuffnews,2006-08-10T14:55Z,"If quality is the question why then don´t copy on
on DVD9 without 10000 steps?! Most films noone is looking more than one time - so why wasting all the time if you can copy directly with DVDshrink a common DVD in 30 minutes including burning?! Already if the original includes Alpha or crap like this you use Alcohol doing a perfect image, then shrink it with DVDshrink and burn... "
,rdvenom,2006-08-10T15:44Z,"greyriver,  I also think that its a heuristic scan that is suspecting the crack file as a trojan because of what it needs to do to the registry.

snuffnews,  dude if you want to use DVD shrink and have low quality then go ahead.  The encoder in DVD Shrink is far inferior to CCE.  If you want the best quality possible then use the CCE encoder posted here.   Maybe the reason people want to put it on DVD5 is because it's cheaper and they dont have a dual layer burner."
,killingjokez,2006-08-10T15:44Z,"DVD Shrink is crap compared to the DVD Rebuilder/CCE combo. DVD Shrink just compresses, whereas CCE completely reencodes. No comparison at all."
,snuffnews,2006-08-10T17:06Z,"Once again - what DVDshrink belongs maybe youre right! But i use this for years and it works fine! If it is that bad - why it is prohibited in so many countries?!  It´s like driving cars dudes switch in the key and drive, it´s not about making an IT-workshop out of it. And movies i like much i normally buy! This all sounds like Linux users who love their keyboards or pimpin´up my car with certain idiotism - at last i just wanna watch a movie and the quality is okay."
,JJJBBB,2006-08-10T23:31Z,yup... what snuffnews said.
,killingjokez,2006-08-11T00:54Z,"snuffnews, DVDRB/CCE isn't difficult at all. OK it takes a bit of effort to set up initially but once that's done it's easy to use. Taking your analogy further both a Mini and a Rolls Royce will get you from from A to B, but one will do it in style and quality, the other will just about do.

If you can't be arsed to give CCE a go, certainly don't go saying DVD Shrink is better, because it's most definitely IS not. I've thrown DVDs away that someone has reduced with DVD Shrink. And when was the last time you ever saw a DVD release done with Shrink? Scene releases would be laughed away if done with DVD Shrink. CCE is the industry standard MPEG2 encoder remember."

Latest version is 1.10.3 The highest quality ripping method available!!! http://dvd-rb.dvd2go.org/  And use the freeware HC encoder found in the download section, it's just as good as the CCE encoder.

,Waldobaby,2006-08-15T08:56Z,"It appears that many people are missing the point, and the point is simple: do not fuck with ANY program that gives your anti-virus / anti-spyware / anti-trojan software the fits. 
PERIOD."
