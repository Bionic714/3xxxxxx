Forget to push the triangle for debug.
Instead keep ctrl+F9 pushed until the registration window apears. After entering a name and push the regbutton,  use ctrl+F9 in Ollydbg again. You also need v1.10 of Ollydbg,  1.09b didn't work.
Good Luck!"

also, to waleed's and same thing (and khalid) so, they are at school just to get to know each other and the school.. and once we give them the files they will get their books and registeration

If it does work on your computer: The Product ID is determined by one of your HDD serial numbers. Don't know which one, but if u change around your IDE buses after you crack, it won't load. Gotta re-crack."

Your serial doesn't work for me, but could you tell me the steps you took to get it, and where to look for it?"
,David-7237,2006-09-01T19:45Z,"1-Run ollydbg from the archieve...
2-go to File-->Open  and browse for dumpserial.exe...wait till it finishes analysing
3-press the blue triangle(looks like the Play button in the recorder)
4-now it should start.. and a window pops up(the dumpserial)
5-type any NAME in the box below(not the 2 boxes above) and press the button below it
6-go back to ollybdg(if it didn't get back by itself) and press that triangle again.
7-now in ollybdg.. you see 3 boxes with 3 scroll bars each.. look at the thrid one to the right(the box)
8-scroll up slowly you will see you NAME that you entered in the box in dumpserial, right?.. ok
9-scroll up slowly.. and look for UNICODE.. right next to it is the serial for you...
it looks like this:
EJFOJMKPFJIOMQOOINELCNGIMANIOOHG

don't forget to save the Serial you got for a future use... you won't need ollydbg anymore.."

If i try to debug rcv4.exe (which theoriticaly looks the same as dumpserial, same size and mod date) It goes past that point but no serial nor the name is shown in the ""box"""
,wlaziu,2006-09-02T12:20Z,"OK no worries i've done it via my second system (good old 98). At the beggining it wouldn't start because of lacks in .ocx files in system dir but debugger was saying wich files were missing so i fed up him with those form xp. Works Great

BUT

I can't get this thing to run...I've done the ollydbg, and dumpserial thing, but now when I click on the rc4.exe file to enter the reg key, the rc4.exe file won't even start!  I click on it, and nothing happens.  I've even tried reinstalling rc4, with no luck.  Did anyone have the same problem?  Is there any fix for this?"

I installed rc4, then update 4.01 and 4.02 (sobstitution of exe). After run dumpserial and create my code, i try to insert in.
It seems go ok but when I restart rc4.exe appears again the registration popup!
Where is the problem? 
Maybe in the sequence of install?
Thanks! "
,David-7237,2006-12-16T02:46Z,"@sauceface, Scorpio85 

1.	Install rcv4 and copy dumpserial.exe in same directory as the rcv4.exe

2.	Now you'll need OllyDbg.exe to continue (if you don't have it, make a Google search and download).

3.	Start OllyDbg.exe and open dumpserial.exe with it. You'll see a ""pause"" sign on the left hand side.	

4.	Start ""Debug"" (Hit the triangle on the menu). OllyDbg will pause again. Hit CTRL+F9 a few times untill the dialog box in dumpserial opens.

5.	Now enter ANY name in the box where it wants a registration key - click the box under.

6.	Go back to OllyDbg and debug again.

7.	Go to the box on the bottom right and scroll up. Look for UNICODE. You'll find one with the name you entered in the dumpserial, and an 	other below it. SKIP them and to continue scroll up until you find a UNICODE with something like this:
	""EJFOJMKPFJIOMQOOINELCNGIMANIOOHG"". Copy the code within the quotes - that's your licence key.
8.	Now open rcv4.exe and enter your code in the box for reg, key. Click the box below - the dialog screen will disapear. Open RCV4.exe again 	and now the program should be running OK. Save your Reg Key for future use."

[T],stevekasian,2007-01-01T11:57Z,"You people just don't fuckin read. I warned you - his crack is a load of shit! The fucking dumpserial.exe was never written correctly in the first place, that's why u gotta use ollydebug on it to find the serial it generates and stores in memory. Unfort., the process only works on some machines.

Why the fuck doesn't someone just re-write the damn shit keygen correctly? If Iz the dumbass coder who wrote this thing, I'd be pretty ashamed of myself and be quick to save my rep. and release a proper program. lol What a dumbass."

,fourkills,2007-07-19T09:04Z,"Heres how to get it to work, step by step.

1. Download Ollydbg (Google Search)
2. Open dumpserial.exe into it.
3. Press Play
4. Enter ANY serial & click to submit
5. The program should run into an error...
6. There should be a window in the bottom right hand corner. Click on it and scroll around until you find UNICODE ""OMEH8JHS7JIHS"" (Varies).
9. Copy that, it is your damn code.
10. Open RCV4, and paste it. App should close itself. Reopen RCV4, and enjoy.

It is really damn simple people.

Oh and for ThePupper; try searching around google, see if you can down a new one."

using dumpserial.exe with ArtMoney!!!
1. Install RC, copy dumpserial.exe to rc4 folder
2. Install latest ArtMoney from ArtMoney.ru and run.
3. Run dumpserial.exe, enter exotic name in lower box (for ex: hollymolly) and press button below. The program will hang on.
4. Go to ArtMoney, choose process Radar Contact. Press search button. In opened dialog set Value: hollymolly, press ? to the right then in new dialog press Encoding and select Windows and Unicode. Press ok and ok.
5. It will find two entries. Press green arrow. You will see hollymolly  with its addresses.
6. Now go to menu Process ? Memory editor and move to these addresses.
7. There You ll find first part of the serial key (little above of hollymolly word in text window). It will look like KHIKHCIMIGOGABHLOJNBHBFNDOGE. 
BUT THE LAST SEVERAL LETTERS WILL BE MISSING. The serial key consist of 32 letters.
But you can find the remaining in other places of the process memory.
8. Repeat search in ArtMoney, now look for the fragment of your key ie KHIKHCIMIGOG (in Unicode!)
9. Youll find 8 addresses. Seek for key that is the longest consisting of 32 letters.
Use this key to register"

,Frederf220,2010-08-03T14:11Z,"Thanks to social anxiety's method it worked. I ran dumpserial and pasted baloney in the key field, hitting submit. The program crashed but hung on the ""Has encountered an error, press OK to close"" dialog so all that luscious data stayed in memory while I mined at it with ArtMoney.

I found two instances of my baloney tracer key. Just a few lines above that I found some capital letters spread out over several rows consecutively like L O P Q E T S W N... etc. I happened to get lucky and the one I found was the full 32 character key. This is the key that tthe registration program holds as correct to comparison when you submit your key.

I copied the key down and on the next run through registration process success. I think finished the upgrade path to 4.3 via 4.01, 4.2."

,gerrarditto,2011-05-06T13:15Z,"How the fuck did you manage to crack this think??? I've tried with both options from here, but non of them is working. 
After I tried with aArtMoney I searched for the key and I found this: iqldehhijhjckbdhdkgfjjiodagnobog
But when I insert this key in radar contact and press the button below, the windows it's staying for 5s opened and the is closing. 
When I open again RC it's asking me for a license key. 

Help me guys!"
,gerrarditto,2011-05-06T13:26Z,"Now it's working.
I just retype the serial but with capitals.
Thank you!"
,paoloa,2011-06-14T10:46Z,"Does anyone got this working on FSX using W7 64bit? I always get a runtime 6 error when using the dumpserial.exe and also the Artmoney procedure is not working for me. 

If anyone got it to work on FSX with W7 64B please let me know!!!! I keep seeding the file in the meantime. "
,friezer,2011-07-21T20:12Z,"ATENTION 64 bits users (WIN7/XP/VISTA)!!!!!!!!!!!!

The reason why OLLYDBG is not working on 64 bits machines is because debuggers were pre-defined to work on 32 machines and not 64. So in order to work on 64 just download the following file and put in the same folder where you installed OLLYDBG (http://board.b-at-s.info/index.php?showtopic=6881&st=0) it´s called stealth64. It´s in that same page"

,KevTheOne,2011-08-31T23:54Z,It doesnt work at all
,laukejas,2011-09-18T15:38Z,"I run Windows 7 64 bit, using OllyDbg with stealth64. Everything works as it should, but the serial provided by OllyDbg is not accepted by rc4.exe. I enter serial (in capitals, no spaces), then rc4.exe closes, and next time I open it, it requires serial again. It worked on XP 32bit, (with both OllyDbg and ArtMoney), but does not work with Windows 7 64bit, even with stealth64 file. What to do? Please, help..."
,laukejas,2011-09-18T15:51Z,"I failed to mention, that it doesn't work with versions 4.2 and 4.3. Versions 4.0 and 4.1 accept the serial. How can I make 4.3 accept it?"
,mickyfinnny,2011-12-08T13:41Z,"socialanxiety has the answer,i also use win 7 64bit and for the life of me couldnt get dumpserial.exe and stealth to work.A little bit of the old grey matter,together with artmoney and you will work it out.Thanks to socialanxiety,and David-7237 for upping."
,andy_mk3,2012-03-21T00:25Z,"Wow, after about 2 hours of trying with OllyDbg and ArtMoney, I finally got it working :D Many thanks to all that have helped."
,iramacky,2012-05-11T00:18Z,"Id just like to say thanks David-7237 for upping this program. Now i use FSX on vista 64 and i got this working so far and updated to v4.3. Im at it about 8 hours now if not more, but after i looked back at what had to be done it was silly mistakes i was making that kept it that length of time. Anyway im going to put this bitch to the test and ill let you's know. On v4 it was fully working on FSX so ill test it now for a few hours on v4.3 and ill let you know but im very certain its working 100%. If so ill type a step by step guide on what to do which shouldin take that long since i know what mistakes i made so and so. Even better if someone did want help we could teamspeak 3 - Save me typing it out. All the best"
,iramacky,2012-05-11T21:09Z,"well iv put this to the test and as far as i can tell, Everything works 100%. Its a really great program to have, infact i dont think ill ever fly FSX again without it. I really like the co-pilot feather, Very usefull if you had to run out for a few mins and leave him to fly. Well thats it all iv tested this and it works 100%. These are the other addons i used while testing RC...FSX SP2, Vista 64, FsCaptain, UT2, ActiveSky, UTX, and few addons planes and scenery. So thats the update and it works 100% on FSX Vista 64 bit. Plus i didn need any stealth64 or ollydgb thing. All the best"
