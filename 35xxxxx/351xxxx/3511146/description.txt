Learning XHTML
with: William E. Weinman

In the fast-paced world of web development XHTML is becoming as important as HTML. Whether you are already 
familiar with HTML or just learning, whether you use an authoring system or write by hand, you need to know 
XHTML and how it works. Learning XHTML is designed to help you understand XHTML, why it is replacing HTML for 
many new applications, and how to make it work for you. More than just a tutorial, Learning XHTML covers the how 
and the why of XHTML documents, including document structure, block and inline level tags, floating images, 
controlling white space, phrase and font markup, and much more! From setting up a simple web page to adding 
Cascading Style Sheets and JavaScript rollovers, Learning XHTML gives you the skills you need to take control of 
your web pages.
