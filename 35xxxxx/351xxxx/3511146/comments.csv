,JSIT99,2008-04-19T16:07Z,"It doesn't work as it should be MAC & PC

Nothing to see with the link

,50footqueenie,2008-05-21T15:09Z,This does not work on a mac.  I am confused because since it is a movie file it should be cross-platform but it's an .exe file.
,digiectomy,2008-08-03T11:13Z,"Mac users, ignore the above comments.
the exe is the powerISO app for windows.  You won't need it.
The stuff you're looking for is in a .daa file.
daa is a disk image that is proprietary to PowerISO, so what you WILL need is a converter to change the daa to an iso.

The app is free.  I tested the conversion, mounted the iso, and watched a video.  It looks good.

Big ups to na74 for including the FULL disc image!  Exercise files and all.  Nice!"
,digiectomy,2008-08-03T11:17Z,"Thinking about it ... maybe 50footqueenie was referring to the exe in the disc image...

Lynda dot com makes their images to work on pc and mac, so the exes are there on the disc for pc users, and all the autorun stuff for mac users is there, too.

Yep.

Good seeds right now, too.  File came down in a few hours."
