,anavah2003,2007-02-19T12:20Z,PLEASE SEED...
,sumsaR2,2007-04-23T21:27Z,"the picture's lagging, and there's only spanish subtiltles... fuckin' douchy!"
,OrpheusDude,2008-09-02T18:02Z,I and several other Peers are all stuck at 99.7%.  PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE SEED!!!!!
,OrpheusDude,2008-09-03T01:22Z,"The 700.26 MB version of this film (scroll down a little on the Pirate Bay directory, searching under ""Lynch Straight"") is the way to go: the quality is superb and the download is fast and reliable.

I have been stuck at 99.8% at Coralito's site for 5 days and am about ready to hit the ""cancel"" button.  Unless Coralito or somebody seeds, this download is a huge waste of time and space.  DON'T USE THIS DOWNLOAD UNTIL IT IS PROPERLY RESEEDED!

,Cbswe,2009-08-12T23:05Z,The picture is lagging. Also.. the video feels really compressed even though it is a full dvd-r download. I'll check with the other dvd-rip and the other dvd-r image (even though it only has 1 seeder atm...)
,araysoloartist,2009-09-11T22:21Z,Please seed I really want this movie....
