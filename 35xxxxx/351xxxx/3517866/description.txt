Justice - Season 1, Episode 1.

The show features a dream team of four lawyers from disparate backgrounds who join forces to tackle the most controversial and newsworthy cases at the law firm of Trott, Nicholson, Tuller & Graves. (TNT&G)

The show is unique in that- unlike other crime shows- it centers around the trial of the accused, and is in the defendant's point of view. The true crime is revealed to the audience only after the verdict is read and the defendant's fate decided.

Some critics declared the show to be "CSI meeting Law & Order at the speed of 24."
