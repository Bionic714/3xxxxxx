,Xenity,2006-09-02T22:14Z,"As a counterpoint to all the 'mystery', here's the link to IMDB:
http://imdb.com/title/tt0846789/

IMHO, the IMDB commenter throws the baby out with the bathwater (as the saying goes), but he does identify a major issue I have with most if not all of the 'new age' types, and that is the narcissistic tendency towards 'blaming the victim'.  In other words, if something bad happens to a person, it is their fault, in the new age view.  I myself reject this notion as too simplistic, while at the same time trying to keep an open mind about possible connections between 'mind and matter'."

,CT2006,2006-10-16T13:40Z,"What they forget to mention in the movie is that for this to work "" U must have power"" !

The idea of atraction is taken out of the eastern philosophy and spiritual practice, like Yoga and Tantra, where it is mentioned as "" The law of Resonance""  But there it is taught as a three-step-method.

So by taking the subject out of the larger context they make it seem undooable and unbelieaveable. By forgetting to tell you what they do tell you in Tantra Yoga (that you need power and a strong focsed mind) they are actualy just telling you ABOUT the secret, but not HOW to make the secret work. 

The way to make this principle work is like this: 

1. First gain power!!! Do Tai Chi - Yoga, or Tantra that realy builds up power in your aura. 

2. Then Train in meditaion to get a one point focused mind!! If our mental processes are scatered in 100 different directions, by the end of the day we dont have enough energy to realise just one of those ideas!

3. Then aply the principle of atraction!! Use the power you have build up together with the laser-like quality of a strong focused mind to start emanating thoughts and atracting. 

In the film they dont put it like this because they never realy studied the mechanisms of the ""principle of our atracting subcounscious mind""...They just found themselves at the peak of success and then thought: ""Whoa, it mus be because i was going on the lines of atraction"". What they dont realise is that they already HAD power! And they already HAD a strong and focused mind...otherwise they wouldnt be where they are.

Some people are born with power and a strong mind, but most of us must work for it. So work for that first...then aply the law of atraction. And u will see for yourself.

There is nothing wrong with the principle of atraction, its just us that are weak in so many ways..."
,Tuxis,2006-10-27T17:53Z,"I think it was Mark Twain who said ""keep an open mind, but not so open that your brain falls out.""

 In the movie they say you can cure cancer whit positive thinking, you can heal yourself. That?s just one example of how fucked up this film is. In it they try to pass everything they say of as truth and they say a lot of fucked up bullshit.

,Tuxis,2006-10-27T18:03Z,"Sorry I think it might have been Richard Feynman who wrote/said ""keep an open mind, but not so open that your brain falls out."""
,Tuxis,2006-10-31T13:17Z,"""Yes, I paid for it.""

""Also, this is free. You don't have to pay for it, unlike those books (which are mostly scams, which we all know).""

Is something wrong here....? You had to pay for it just like those books which you seem to think of as scams. Is it because it?s a movie you think it isn?t...?


Why don't you try to chop of your leg and then try to grow it back whit positive thinking. Sure the placebo effect exists but that does not mean that you can cure your body through thinking.

His body healed itself the normal way. I mean if I cut myself it isn?t me thinking positively that makes it heal. 

Oh. And I think her name is written like this. Oprah?"
,Tuxis,2006-11-03T20:31Z,"""Stress/depression makes injuries heal slower.""

Stress slows wounds from healing that is true. But that doesn?t mean that you can heal cancer by being happy, it doesn?t mean that a leg can grow back out, and it doesn?t mean that the man in the movie can walk today because of a happy cure. It just means that if you are stressed wounds heals slower. That may be of help to you if you?re going into surgery. And your life depends on you having a fast recovery.

Besides I have not read anything anywhere about injuries healing faster if you?re in an extremely happy state neither.

""Scientists investigating why wounds heal more slowly on patients who are stressed have found that psychological stress can increase the levels of some hormones in the blood.
These hormones can slow the delivery of certain compounds -- cytokines -- to the site of the injury to start the healing process.
But if the process is slowed at the beginning, the wound will take much longer to heal, posing potentially serious consequences to patients recovering from surgery."""

,YourMomma,2007-01-16T11:35Z,"Seriously, this movie rocks!  At the beginning of December I hated my job so much it was making me sick.  The bad part was I couldn't think of what job I would possibly want to do that wouldn't repulse me!  

I started watching this movie every day and two weeks later I lost my job (yes, the one I hated).  The weird part is I was living paycheck to paycheck and even though I don't have a job all my bills AND my rent are getting paid.  

Now it's 30 days later and I have figured out exactly what I would love to do for a career and I get so many ideas on a daily basis about my new business I barely have time to do simple things like take out the trash or do the dishes.  The weirdest thing is I'm ecstatic all the time now.  

I've tried to work with texts like Catherine Ponder and others over the last 17 years of my life and they were all shit - they did nothing.  Watching this video every day for 30 days has moved more mountains and caused cash just to COME to me in the strangest ways that I was never expecting - it's frickin' amazing.  

If you've been living a challenged life for a long time (never having enough money to feed your kids, hating every job you've ever had, always behind on your bills), I'd advise going to the EFT (Emotional Freedom Technique) website and downloading the free EFT PDF manual.  People that have been living in severely negative lives have to get that crap out of their system.  Its just an easy, free way to get the ball rolling even quicker.  

It absolutely has nothing to do with personal power.  One of my friends is just as mousey as she can be and even she's started getting business ideas out of the blue.  (She's actually the one that sent me link to the YouTube copy of the movie.)  On top of that, I never meditate...mostly because any time I've tried I fall asleep.  I gave up on meditation many years ago.

I got my good DVD copy off another torrent web site.  Loved the commentary, outtakes, etc.  

You want to have the best life ever, go for it.  You want to grumble about things not working, let it be.  It's a personal choice, but it works if you do the things they say.  I've already manifested two things off my vision board. :)

The first amount of cash I manifested out of the blue?  $1,800.00.  That was proof enough for me. I had an open mind though.  When I told my girlfriend how I felt after watching that video for 30 days every day, she said it sounded like I was on coke.  Free endorphins - hell, I'll take those any day.  I love being happy as all out.  "
,Judas4ever,2007-03-11T00:18Z,This movie has one agenda to spread a crap dumbass message . Dont dl its really a big waste of time!
,danny_g,2007-06-11T15:40Z,"Why do people like Tuxis even bother watching this movie if all they ever do is crap all over it. Are they the voice of reason for us all? He/She must live a pretty sad sort of life were there is no hope. As long as this movie helps one person on this planet, then it is a succes in my book. And I'm sure there it has helped more then just one person. Instead of being so critical, why dont you give it a try. Or are you scared it might just work and prove all your self rightous theories wrong. 
Since I've watched this movie things in my life have definatly taken a turn for the better. At the very least why not try at least to be positive about things instead of trying to bring everyone down. "
,Quite_Contrary,2007-06-25T02:22Z,"halo08master08cap,
    Thank you for the d/l. This is amazing information! For those cynics, you probably need this the most."
,kauken,2008-01-28T21:56Z,"READ THIS FIRST BEFORE U DOWNLOAD.

If you are a cleaner, parking attender, live of wellfare, alcoholic, druggie, a hillbilly ( or from Hisingen/Bromma in sweden) , gayhater, rasist, pedophile or close AND you spend your days looking at other peopels faults ( classic projection) in order to avoid seeing and feeling your own misery....

... AND you enjoy it and have no intention to change your life: 
THEN DO ABSOLUTELY NOT DOWNLOAD THIS - it may cause strong reactions to you and you might see how you COULD live - this of course may have you to post stupid comments here and farting through your mouth as some people already have.


IF THIS IS NOT YOU .... then ""the secret"" is nothing new- it is a way of living. However in this movie  it is presented in a maybe more appealing way to the modern western person. What may have scared the, as mentioned above, lonely and scared people from the outskirts of Sweden who listen to rasistrock and drink beer on tuesdays watching the exciting game of ""Handboll"" - is the unfortunate hollywood way of presenting it where they focus on wealth, money and building expectations through music etc.... 

But however, I downloaded this( with many other resources like this) 1 year ago and my life has become just the opposite. You see I was like the swedish scared people before - and I came from a background where my father constantly complained and projected his own fear onto others. I was lonely, scared, angry, and had accomplished nothing ( else than jerking off twice each day ).

I was 25 when I decided to change this and these resources helped me alot. Today I am 26 and I am always happy, positive ( might not look like it here  he he ;) smiling. All my friends returned after they saw that I wasnt complaining anymore, I got hundreds of new friends. I fuck at least 2 new women each week and trust me they are hotties from the age 20 to 45. 
I have now sold my first succesfull comany for 1,2 million swedsih kronor ( not  much, but it keeps me going). 

LOOK, its all up to YOu and how YOU WANT to view it. Of course its easier to not beleive in this, but waht are you then doing here and downloading it?? Just keep on with your live - but if your not satisfied - then do something about it and The Secret is a great way to start.

Thank you for reading this far - it means that you are serious. 

Puss p책 rumpan. "

,eastern876,2008-06-03T10:28Z,"If you are interested in this subject matter, you will definitely want to get the following torrent: 

In the 1980s, radio station KABC carried the ground-breaking radio program ""OPEN MIND"" with host Bill Jenkins.   The subject matter covered included UFOs, alternative energy, spirituality, ancient religions, and more.   Bill Jenkins later went on to host the classic film ""THE NAKED TRUTH"" with Jordan Maxwell, upon which the current internet hit ""ZEITGEIST"" is based.

The ""Open Mind"" radio programs have not been heard in many years ... until now.   We recently came into possession of a large collection of cassette tape recordings which had been made by a loyal listener, and had them digitized into MP3s.  This is a priceless collection of otherwise unattainable radio programs.   It is being freely shared here in an effort to make sure it is not lost to  history.
