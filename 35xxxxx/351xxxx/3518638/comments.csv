This is really an Oldfield masterpiece, the man is a genius!
I only had ""Millennium Bell"" on CD, but the ""Art In Heaven"" concert on DVD
really brings a whole new dimension to the music.
I just regret I didn't went to Berlin in Y2K...

Every song is great, but my favourite is ""Amber Light"".
Fantastic music, and the lovely singer Helen ""Pepsi"" Demacque is so cute in her white jacket and black hat. 
Can you imagine she was 42 years old when this was recorded?
She really looks a lot younger.
What an attractive, adorable, beutiful and gorgeous woman she is!
Lovely!!!

I must try to get a legal copy of this DVD, it's almost a blasphemy to download it from TPB :-)"
