,Son Of Mogh,2006-09-03T07:17Z,"I played halo cd some time ago, is halo pc different or is it just the same in a different package? 

Thnx for the up!"
,Son Of Mogh,2006-09-03T07:18Z,I meant I played halo ce some time ago.
,Getus,2006-09-04T17:24Z,"it was differnet a long time ago ... there was only 1 cd (this is just over a cd... maybe a cd and a half), and it contains 'custom edition' which i dont have a clue wat it is ... and why is the trial packed with this? "
,FlameBV,2006-09-04T22:22Z,"Custom Edition lets you use custom maps, but its multiplayer only. (I included five custom maps for you, you can get more at halomaps.org). You can make custom maps too.

I included the Trial because it has a following and people still play it. It can be fun actually. Try it.

I play all three, I most frequently play CE 1.6 and PC 1.4."
,FlameBV,2006-09-04T22:24Z,"SOrry for double commenting but I forgot to answer Son's question. Halo PC has more players, includes singleplayer, and does not allow you to play custom maps. I explained CE in my first comment."
,FlameBV,2006-09-04T22:27Z,"Triple comment, I know I suck but the trackers for this are:

,Son Of Mogh,2006-09-04T22:34Z,Thnx for info. And many thnx for upping this!
,skankin,2006-09-05T11:38Z,"The comment for the torrent says, Seed it.. But the upper forgot to seed it long enough for us to get stuck at 99,9% :P

Sucks :) Yesterday i saw we where about 50 with that problem :P"
,MrVaffel,2006-09-05T17:22Z,"Me 2 =/

:("
,MrVaffel,2006-09-05T17:25Z,"Lol, sorry for posting twice, but does anyone know some place I can get CD-keys for Halo? Been looking around a little yesterday but found nothing...

I know there should be a website or something for this but I can't remember it =D"
,Real1,2006-09-05T21:29Z,For god's sake. Eevryone is stuck at 99.9% SEED
,ChronoSpark,2006-09-07T00:06Z,"someone seed please, i've been stuck at 99.9% forever!!"

,FlameBV,2006-09-09T04:45Z,I'm seeding mad crazy. Just hold on there.
,ChronoSpark,2006-09-09T04:58Z,"still no seeds... =\ still stuck at 99.9%, 1.19 GB... i'll give it some more time, but this is annoyingly frustrating"
,FlameBV,2006-09-09T05:52Z,"I HAVE FOUND THE PROBLEM. There is an error in the HaloTrialSetup.exe file. If you skip that file, you should get to 100 percent. Then just follow the instructions, skipping steps 4, 15a/b, and 16a/b.

You can download Halo Trial legally from http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=1c2678b1-90a1-4ca7-af68-b83ae2dec1cf&DisplayLang=en if you wish."
,ChronoSpark,2006-09-09T08:11Z,"maybe i'm a total noob, but what do you mean when you say to ""mount"" the .ISO file? ...=\"
,ChronoSpark,2006-09-09T09:59Z,"k, nvm, i am a noob XD got it.. works great! thank you!"
,the seal giver,2006-09-10T14:04Z,where can i find the damn cd-key?
,FlameBV,2006-09-10T18:08Z,That's your problem. FLAME never supplies CD-Keys on BitTorrent. We supply them on the Scene but we aren't supposed to disclose them.

,-Sairus-,2007-03-01T15:32Z,"It stops at 99.9% because the NFO (readme) is missing. just cancel the download (dont delete data duh) and you're good to go.

@clown, you're the dumbass, think before you post"
,Herofish,2007-03-14T20:56Z,"Articuno, I think it's pretty openly that your cd-key is invalid. Let's day it like this; you're pretty screwed."
