This pack was put onto the Scene by {F2}BV.

This pack was ripped off the Scene and put onto BitTorrent by {F2}Humble.

FLAME is a Scene group that does not release on BT. Most of our work on BT
was put on BT by people that show it off as their work. We don't like it,
but it doesn't matter to us. Just remember that we know who we are talking
about, and that they shouldn't be underestimating us.

FLAME runs on 370 servers located in the Netherlands. Each is served by 12
T3 lines.

{F2} Humble: I got permission to release this on BT as long as I included
BV's readme.
