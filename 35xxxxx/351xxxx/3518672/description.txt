This is an updated version of FairUse4WM that works with the latest version of Micrsofot's DRM components. (They updated it to make FairUse4WM not work anymore, so viodentia fixed it!)

This program will quickly and lossless remove the DRM from just about any protected WMA or WMV file you have the license for.

Changelog: 
--- Works with the new IBX version being pushed by Microsoft on new individualizations.
--- DRMv1 support for files you ripped yourself with protection enabled
--- Now should work with WM9 (individualized) 
--- Includes a Workaround for WM11beta2
--- Subdirectory support - takes a directory as the command-line parameter
