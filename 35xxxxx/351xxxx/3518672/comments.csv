If it uses Microsoft DRM, then it will work 99 percent of the time regardless of where it came from. Those times when it doesn't work has more to do with your individual machine than anything else."

If you download DRM'd files from someone else, this app *WILL NOT* strip work for you. As the name suggests, it's for ""Fair Use"" of content you own, rather than a means to pirate music without paying for it."
,uraphake,2006-09-18T09:21Z,"geekdreams: I know that. I misunderstood what PhxAnarchy was saying. Yes, if I sent my DRM'ed files to you, you would not be able to unDRM them. The term ""downloaded elsewhere"" seemed ambiguous as to the meaning."
