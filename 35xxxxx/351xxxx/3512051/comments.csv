,man_dude,2006-11-19T13:36Z,"If it should be a virus, don't you think the other 306 downloaders would say it was a virus? :P i'm just speculate.."
[T],ale4,2007-08-11T11:19Z,It's good antivirus!
,f0ffen,2008-04-15T09:07Z,Maybe the other downloaders didn't notice that there is a virus installed thinking that they have antivirus installed and therefore are safe from it? 
,ICPeti,2008-08-24T06:45Z,"Only way to get this is U have to surf with Your mobile to http://mobile.f-secure.com/devices/index.html and download from there, trial or buy... "
