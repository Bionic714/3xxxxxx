\ The sequel to the epic Little Big Adventure had been long waited for. Adeline   \
\ wanted to create something new with LBA2 as they did with LBA1, while           \
\ maintaining the feeling and sense of adventure of LBA1. After a year and a half \
\ in production, LBA2 was finally released late in the summer of 1997.            \
\                                                                                 \
\                                                                                 \
\ Twinsen chattingStory: LBA2 takes place a couple of years after the defeat of   \
\ the tyrant Dr. Funfrock in LBA1. The planet has adjusted to life without        \
\ FunFrock in power, and everything is peaceful. You start off on a quest to find \
\ the weatherman, as bad weather is preventing you from travelling. But as you    \
\ find him, and he clears the sky of dense rain clouds, UFOs land, and friendly   \
\ Aliens emerge. The story revolves around those Aliens and their somewhat vague  \
\ intentions at times. You travel across the three planets, Twinsun, Emerald      \
\ moon, and Zeelich in an attempt to discover the truth regarding their           \
\ intentions.                                                                     \
\                                                                                 \
\ Graphics: The Adeline team had, at the time, always been a pioneer in the field \
\ of graphics. First implementing 3d into Alone in the Dark, then using           \
\ incredibly detailed static backgrounds in LBA1, and pushing the boundaries with \
\ prerendered backgrounds in Time Commando. It was obvious from the start they    \
\ were going to do something new with LBA2 yet again. And they did.               \
\                                                                                 \
\ LBA2 boasts a full 3D world, something not so common in the world of adventure  \
\ gaming during that time. LBA2 is a world of detailed and lush terrain, fluidly  \
\ animated characters, and special effects rarely used during its day was the     \
\ norm in LBA2, such as the rain on Citadel Island when you first start the game, \
\ or the fiery lava on Celebration Island.                                        \
\                                                                                 \
\ LBA2 also used a completely rewritten game engine, the "Nectar", which made all \
\ the graphics possible in LBA2. One thing can be said about LBA2's graphics      \
\ without uncertainty; they leave the game playable to this day with little       \
\ complaints.                                                                     \
\                                                                                 \
\ Audio: Philippe Vachey, who composed the soundtrack for LBA1 continued to       \
\ compose music for LBA2. The music of LBA2 had a more epic feeling to it, aimed  \
\ at emphasising the feeling of battle. Unlike LBA1, LBA2 features a fair amount  \
\ of fighting, with soldiers far more common and aggressive, and even better      \
\ equipped. The soundtracks adjust to that, so say a location you visit is        \
\ over-run by the emperors soldiers, the music track would blend into a track     \
\ with a more epic upbeat feeling to it. Also, like LBA1, there are voice overs   \
\ for all the characters. One word comes to mind while were on the topic of voice \
\ overs, Mosquibees...                                                            \
\                                                                                 \
\                                                                                 \
\                                                                                 \
\ Franco's IslandGameplay: The gameplay in LBA2 has not changed much compared to  \
\ the one of LBA1, except for some small new functions. You can still use the     \
\ same behaviour scheme with the Normal, Athletic (now called 'Sporty'),          \
\ Aggressive and Discreet modes. As an addition Twinsen can now avoid projectiles \
\ with  some dashing moves that are different in all four behaviour modes. The    \
\ health meter, magic meter and clover boxes are still there. There are again     \
\ four levels of magic in which the magic bar will extend and the magic ball will \
\ become more powerful. In the beginning of the game you start with the first     \
\ level of magic again. There is still place for twenty-eight different items.    \
\ There are more weapons than in LBA1, including a laser pistol and an            \
\ upgradeable blowgun.                                                            \
\                                                                                 \
\ Overall: LBA2 expands upon the sense of adventure displayed in LBA1. While the  \
\ game is at times lacking in puzzles, or scenarios requiring you to think your   \
\ way out, it is an improvement over its predecessor in terms of gameplay. Its    \
\ strongest point is its ability to fully immerse the player in a world that is   \
\ unique and funny.                                                               \
