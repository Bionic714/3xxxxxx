,soh_crzy,2006-08-28T06:10Z,Even after applying the patch I can't see anything but blurs.
,krigelkorren,2006-08-28T16:09Z,"hmm thats strange, it worked for me, not sure that the patch is a complete solution that works for everyone though, hope you did extract the patch into the game directory before applying it, else it wont patch correctly. try running the program in compability mode for win95 or 98 if possible. it has never helped me but its worth a shot... else there are a lot of emus out there, one i think is called WINLBA or was it LBAWIN?? :P anyway ive heard some reports about issues there too like lagging when tring to save. hope this comment helps you out a bit ;)"

i'm running on AMD Athlon 64 processor, 3200+ 2.00GHz, 1,0 GB RAM and i have Windows XP pro v2002 service pack 2..i dont know if it makes any sense but i think that the problem is with my hardware or graphics card, or even directX, but i have latest directX..so if anyone could help me solve the problem...i'd be very happy if anyone knows what to do...and btw i cant go to options in game because i dont see nothing really

,noom,2008-04-10T00:56Z,"Patch didn't work for me, but I was able to get the game running in DOSBOX no problems.

If you're running in DOSBOX, it's worth pointing out that you will need to mount the CD drive (whether it's a virtual drive containing the image, or an actual burnt-to-CD copy) as well mounting your hard disk.

To do this, type [b]""mount d x:\ -t cdrom""[/b] within dosbox, obviously replacing x:\ with whatever drive your CD/image is mounted on. The ""-t cdrom"" is important as DOSBOX won't recognise it as a CD drive otherwise and it will prompt you to insert the CD when you try and run LBA2.

Hope this helps some of you. I'm having great fun replaying this one ^_^"
,Dhaka-dice,2008-04-10T13:58Z,"I got this game to start and everything with no graphics problem using the patch.
However, very late in the game, some character routes are all fucked up so I can't exit the volcano island because the ferryman never gets in place and after I've rescued the wizards, I can't move because one of them is trying to walk into one of the others, preventing him from getting to his spot and start talking.

Also, I can't steer the car while driving so I'll have to stop everytime I want to make a turn.

Anyone know a patch to fix this?
I can't complete the game because of the wizards problem. :("
,Bakdom146,2008-04-24T08:26Z,"I downloaded it, got it all to work, with only one small issue.  I can't walk/run and turn left at the same time.  I have to stop completely, turn left, then keep going.  Walking + right works just fine.  Any ideas?"
,Harrewho,2008-04-28T23:10Z,Seed please! I haven't played this game for years! And back then I only played the demo. SO COME ON!!! =D=D
,Harrewho,2008-04-30T16:35Z,"yay! =D at first I only saw blur and so, but after instaling the patch it worked great! Thank for the torrent man"
,nagelbitarn,2008-05-17T19:43Z,"Everything is working flawlessly! Except for one important detail, the music and sound :S It just keeps shutting itself off, it wouldn't be a very big issue, but the music in this game does about 25% of the fun and the nostalgic qualitites it has. If anyone has any answers to what I should do, please tell me!"
,tmac7,2008-05-28T07:27Z,"Hi nagelbitarn, you could use VDMSound and I think you can fix sound problems.

You can download from here:

,Gamejunkiez,2010-08-23T18:04Z,"How to run this on Win7 x64:

- Mount the ISO and copy the folder LBA2 to any location.

- Apply GFX patch.
(You need a older Windows version to patch the exe as the patch file is 16bit.)

- Edit ""LBA2.CFG"" to set the Language

,Contraspirit,2011-05-01T20:51Z,"ppl running windows 7 might find this of interest

ive tried alot of stuff today to get the music/sound to work correctly, only solution i found was to both install and run it via dosbox. i hadnt used dosbox before so i guess shouldnt be too much of a problem. just look up some youtube tutorial, how to mount cds, run games etc.

hope it helps, enjoy"

,88kramer,2011-07-04T18:50Z,"For all Windows 7 64bit users:
You need to run this in DOSbox for it to work perfectly. 

1. Mount the .NRG image in daemon tools.

2. Explore/open the drive you just mounted.

3. Copy the LBA2 folder to your harddrive (e.g C:/programs/lba2)

4. Copy the PATCH.EXE, found in the patch zipfile of the torrent, to the lba folder you created (e.g C:/programs/lba2)

5. Open the folder you created and find the file LBA2.CFG. Open that file with notepad and edit it so it says:

 Language
;
; English
; Franâ€¡ais
; Deutsch
; EspaÂ¤ol
; Italiano
; Portugues

Language: English



; Spoken Language (CD)
;
; English
; Franâ€¡ais
; Deutsch

LanguageCD: English

(This changes the language to english. the game is by default set to french. you may however set it to whatever language you prefer) (also if the text editor wont let you save the edited .CFG file make sure it is not in ""read-only"" mode. you can change this by right clicking the file and going to properties.)

6. Open DOSbox. (if you dont have it. go download and install it first) http://www.dosbox.com/download.php?main=1

7. In DOSbox, type: ""mount d e:\ -t cdrom""
  (This tells DOSbox to use your mounted image as a virtual CD. if you dont do this the game will ask you to insert CD and you wont be able to play)(the ""e:\"" should be replaced with whatever the name of your mounted LBA2 CD is""

8. In DOSbox, type: ""mount c c:/programs/lba2"" or the directory of the folder that you copied LBA2 to. 

9. In DOSbox, type: ""c:""

10. Now you need to patch the game so you dont get any graphical errors that many are experiencing. In DOSbox, type: ""patch""
(the game will patch up. wait for it to finish)

11. Now you should be good to go. In DOSbox, type: ""lba2"" 

12. Enjoy, seed, share & care.

NOTE: If you are getting problems with the Audio droppping out, go download the VDMsound project http://sourceforge.net/projects/vdmsound/ install this and try running the game again. Now the sound should stick with you. =D"
,ponke56,2011-08-16T09:59Z,Your stuff is worth uploading a while =) thank you for nice torrents
,bumclouds,2011-09-06T18:28Z,"Hey folks,

I struggled for a long time with the sound cutting out after about 1 minute on Vista.  The problem was fixed after I installed a patch called 'LBA2 Fixes' which you can find on the Magicball Network.  No need to install DosBox."
