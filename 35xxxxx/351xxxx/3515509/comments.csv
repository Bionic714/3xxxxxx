,jizac2,2006-08-24T22:32Z,Thanks for sharing 
,lozartist,2006-08-27T07:37Z,"wondering how to get the activator to work?
i get a message saying that the file is corrupt or invalid...."
,jizac2,2006-08-27T12:50Z,"It's not working I downgraded back to version 1.9.5.3823 which works fine and as expected.

Don't forget to clean your registry after uninstalling this one before going back to an older one."
,iskoptrixx,2006-08-30T18:07Z,"jizac2 what is the problem? I have the same one and its workin' fine.. 
Well ok downgrade you, but why are you posting how to downgrade, or what to do before you downgrade?
Go and make shitty comments another place.."
,ponyup,2006-09-07T00:37Z,"I'm having trouble with registering, won't seem to accept it."
,urgay,2006-09-09T06:46Z,"to all of you who upload, thx in advance
hopes it works"
,ehagglun,2006-09-09T11:19Z,"You see, this is what really pisses me off.

iskoptrixx, thanks you sharing. If this works for you, fine.

All you 810 people that has downloaded, I guess that at least some of you, say 10 % has installed it, or tried at least. Lets say another 10% of you, that has installed it could actually bother to post a comment on it so the rest of us know wether it works or not. Shitheads.

Now I have to try it myself, and fuck all of you (except isoptrixx) if it doesn't work, you could have told me."

Thanks for backing me up..!!
Other comments are being ignored"
,bakawally,2006-09-19T18:20Z,"I found a method off another site, tested and works for me

""1. install
2. activate&register&forbid url
3. check your Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts for this lines:

127.255.255.255 serial.alcohol-soft.com
127.255.255.255 www.alcohol-soft.com
127.255.255.255 images.alcohol-soft.com
127.255.255.255 trial.alcohol-soft.com

3. block all outgoint communication to IP 195.137.236.101 (in Kerio Personal Firewall is it very easy)

OR

Start->Run->cmd and type
route add 195.137.236.101 mask 255.255.255.255 192.168.X.0 -p
(where X is from your IP or you can replace IP 192... with any non-exist IP in your LAN)

if you can problem with this route, for abort this route type
route delete 195.137.236.101"""
,bakawally,2006-09-19T18:29Z,"Oh some clarifications,

The method uses the keymaker file in this torrent, 

activate, register and forbid url (I use the default info and key and the ""route add"" way)."
