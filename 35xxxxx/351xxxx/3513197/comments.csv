,byblos,2006-08-17T13:41Z,"Hi,

You have to uninstall everything before you install the 1.2 version. It is a complete package."
,byblos,2006-08-17T13:45Z,"I forgot....

If you have the soundpackage, you have to reinstall that after you installed the 1.2 version since that is the only way the aircraft.cfg file will write the correct sound directories for each aircraft."

@ Goku-thing: try to abuse some search-functions instead to pull down a wishlist :|"
,*iON,2006-08-19T22:38Z,Yeah I think you can find 1/4 or half of the stuff here.
,niknil,2006-09-01T15:01Z,"NB!! This does NOT work.

Do NOT bother to download this. It's unwrapped,as it says, but it's not cracked. Trying to load it in FS2004 will give a ""f1pc12.gau"" load error."
,minimaximal,2006-09-05T18:28Z,Yes. I get that error too when i push the FLY button....
