http://redfactionview.net/patchesandfixes.htm

Scroll down the page to ""No CD Patch"" and replace it with the executable inside the Red Faction install folder (AFTER updating the game, otherwise the updater wont update because it will say the file is corrupt).

,doochecookies,2008-02-06T19:03Z,"HEY! i figured out how to fix the freeze at intro video problem. if you can't even get to the main menu of the game because your game freezes then do this = 
go to
C:\games\RedFaction\data\movies
and remove all the videos or just the intro, i would store them somewhere else, just in case. but this alows you to get into the game. you will need to download the 1.20 patch to play online, so just google for it."
,waRse,2008-02-20T17:15Z,If your game looks weird and has lots of graphic problems you will need to download the PureFaction patch from this site http://www.purefaction.org/ ;)

thanks"
,Demonss,2008-04-23T10:43Z,Tnx. I love this game and this is the best game. Old but I love it. I played it 2-3 years ago. But Red Faction 2 is good too. First is better :D
,dave_agaric,2008-06-05T14:10Z,"Great game, used to love this years ago, cheers for the upload, got it in 40mins. No problems with anything so far. Can I use this online? Says incompatable something or other. Its 2 with the bots isnt it?"
,djTeka,2008-06-12T10:23Z,"This is an awesome game.
Can't say the same about the 2nd one.
This one has a good story, good gameplay (Blowing up almost any wall is more fun than it sounds, and it sounds fun in the first place, right?), and online play that still people play on sometimes.

II has bots only multiplayer, no other player can play at the same time with you...
II has a story I could hardly follow, I can only tell there was a twist, since you came up on the main bad guy so fast.
I guess II just kept the gameplay, and screwed everything else 
(but it does have a cool little thing where you can unlock concept art by playing through the game on different difficulties or by doing bonus objectives).

In other words, get this one, get the second one if you want, but expect to be disappointed by the second game."
,dave_agaric,2008-06-12T14:19Z,"Great game, works perfect, cheers for upload. Onlines great. What gamepad would you people recommend? I know you need one that you can redefine to use keyboard keys, so what would you recommend? Im on a laptop, and shooting and running at the same time is a pain in the arse. (havent got a REAL mouse)"

,btbam006,2008-08-15T18:05Z,"Im not saying this doessn't work, i installed it, started it and it said insert disk 2. so i got the no cd crack after updating the game to 1.20 and the game started. When the game starts the graphics are fine but as soon as i move around the walls and the floors start disappearing and stuff, besides that the game works fine, but how do i get rid of that. My computer can definitely play this game, I have Crysis installed on this comp and it runs it fine on all high settings. Any help is appreciated. Thanks."

,Primo-Weed,2009-06-28T23:07Z,"Nvidia 8/9 series - Users running any modern Nvidia graphics cards will suffer from strange graphics anomalies.
""8MB VRAM"" - Users running Windows Vista 64-bit and 4Gb (or more) RAM will receive the following message:""At least 8MB of available VRAM is required to run Red Faction"" and be unable to play.
Dual-Core - Users of any dual-core processor will experience odd warping issues and other problems related to their use of a dual-core processor.

All mentioned bugs and more besides are fixed in the third-party Pure Faction patch.

^From wikipedia.

Even if you don't experience some of these things I suggest getting the patch anyway because I have a dual core Nvidia 8800 and near the end of the game it kept crashing trying to render some things.

Patched it and worked fine, so patch it and enjoy it like the original."
,waRse,2009-07-06T11:38Z,As i stated earlier in the comments you will need the Pure Faction patch to be able to play the game with new hardware http://www.purefaction.org/
,MisterGod,2009-07-13T19:05Z,"I downloaded a different (but seemingly similar torrent) and had a problem that I'm posting here because this has a seemingly larger community.

I use purefaction because none of the cracks that I've tried have worked properly, they all say something about a missing file. This is fine, I was planning on using purefaction anyway. My problem starts after I click new game (using purefaction, or normal with ISO mounted) if I start with training, the game video freezes at the loading screen, I can still here sounds, but that is it. If I skip training, I can watch the video, but it will freeze at the end (or any part that I decide to skip at) I can then hear sounds and words fine, but again my video is stuck.

My video card is by no means old, but also by no means is it great (although I can run halo CoD etc on it) I have Mobile Intel 965 Express Chipset Family 

any help?"

I used MagicDisc and mount both disc 1 and two, and KEEP them mount on two different virtual CD/DVD-ROM.
Try this with your mount .ISO program. If you cannot mount two discs at the same time. Then go to Google and search for MagicDisc. It's a freeware."
