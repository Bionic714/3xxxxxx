A nice gift - this is Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War; all three CDs in ISO (disc image) format, so universally easy to burn. They're stored inside a NON-PASSWORD-PROTECTED tarball (don't worry, Winzip can access it! Along with almost any other archive software in the world), along with a working key (although it won't get you Internet play, it'll allow you to install the game).

The no-CD crack is located within the ISO for CD 1, so will be accessible after it's been burned.

Enjoy! And as usual, if you do... then buy it!
