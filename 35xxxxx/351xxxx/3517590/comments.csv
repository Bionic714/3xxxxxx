,Kane78,2006-08-31T06:28Z,Invalid torrent file... 
,lupine_nickt,2006-08-31T09:15Z,Really? Then how are 10 others managing to use it? ;)
,Mandres,2006-09-03T06:19Z,"I'm getting a file error too with BitTornado.  Don't know what the problem is.
"
,lupine_nickt,2006-09-05T03:27Z,"All I can suggest is that you try a different bittorrent program (I'm using KTorrent, but there you go), and possibly report the problem to the Bittornado devs. It's fairly obviously working with other bittorrent clients - although I couldn't say which, as I've not been seeding for a few days (problems with WLAN). Don't suppose that anyone who *is* downloading this successfully could pop a short message to say which client they're using...?

I suppose one thing could be the filename - bittornado might not like the +'s, or something. I'm grasping at straws, though."
,lupine_nickt,2006-09-05T23:44Z,"People are downloading fine with KTorrent, Bitcomet, mu-torrent, Azureus."
,PimpulaX,2006-09-06T21:27Z,"I am confussed I have downloaded 2 torrents, working fine but when I go to install the game it starts to install AIM, this makes me mad.

Any of you might know why its doing that?."
,pigman_1,2006-09-15T08:57Z,"ok so it downloaded fine and shit but now when i use daemon tools it says ""wrong disk"" this has happened to several games, so im assuming that im doing something wrong"
,ledwing,2006-09-15T11:05Z,"If you get the ""invalid Torrentmessage "",try to mchange  browser,it worked for me."
,Ninj54,2006-09-15T13:26Z,"Getting the same 'wrong disc' error as others. Is everyone else getting this?

If anyone has fixed it can they say how?

Cheers"
,Pantythief,2006-09-16T23:14Z,"You need to go into the ISO for CD1, and copy the exe out of the crack folder and drop it into DoW's root folder, to overwrite the current exe.

Hope this helps"
,juzto,2006-09-22T15:28Z,"Lol... Such bug on the CD 1...
The errormessage all is getting is:
Error 1335. The cabinet file 'Data1.cab' required for the installation is corrupt and cannot be used. This could indicate an network error, an error reading from the CD-ROM, or a problem with this package.
"

,Jiimpa_,2006-10-10T19:56Z,Det hade varit skit bra om någon hade kunnat/viljat seeda..  jag fortsätter att seeda efter att jag fått hem det. 
,Jiimpa_,2006-10-11T13:30Z,"i would be very nice if someone could seed this one. :)  I'll keep on seeding after i've downloaded it!

,robinp91,2006-10-16T21:45Z,i cant install it.. i get the error 1607:Unable to InstallShield Scripting Runtime.. whats wrong? can anyone help me plz
,CarlMemphis,2006-10-19T22:34Z,"Look, I got an errormessage during the checkup at the end of the installationprocess, bitching about this SGA-file that was corrupt. I managed to override it though, and the game was running really smooth exept for one thing. The textures were all missing, leaving all structures and units glowing pink. Not really what I had in mind... So right now I'm looking for a fresh, untaunted copy of the w40kdata_sharedtextures_full1, either  from the w40k folder in anyone's install directory or from the .rar file on disc 3.

You get it? If so, goodie goodie. For I intend to praise thou blessed nerd, as you drop me a line.

Ta-ta"

,sobx10,2007-09-07T23:37Z,"k well i just got one anyway, but why is my disk3 iso corrupt??? everytime i try to install i try to ignore errors and it won't install"
,sobx10,2007-09-08T00:26Z,"k after fucking around for a bit i found out the problem, bittorent said the file was done at 100% but after restarting i found out that it was actually only 86% because i had noticed that there was a huge 40k kb chunk of data misisng that i thought might have gotten corrupted and winrar might have auto deleted it, but no it was bittorent

(ultimate problem fixer = restart)

at this point im still assuming that this torrent works"
