Password for ftp: TRk94-fjlTTy
No leading or trailing spaces...

I just was diligent and found the newest full version on their ftp site... 

The password I found in a link from an un-updated page on their website. :-)

Good Luck, and remember to use a real FTP program... there is an update in the same ftp folder as 5.0.133 (but I have not updated with it)

,BDPr0ductions,2008-11-28T13:48Z,"Let me amend that:

If you use a real ftp program and visit ftp://ftp.overlandstorage.com/Software/Snap/GOS/

Logging in with the name and password I provided, you will see the other file to download.

If you navigate arounf their ftp site, you will find more of what the newest owner of GuardianOS has to offer..
