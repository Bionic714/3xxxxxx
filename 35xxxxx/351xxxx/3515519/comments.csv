,apateu,2007-06-28T00:18Z,I am getting f...ckin frustrated with this torrent shit. Nothing is downloadable. Surely it was meant well but it does not f....ckin work. 
,apateu,2007-06-29T11:37Z,Ignore my comments. It was me being an arsehole and doing it wrong. My apologies. Worked fine. Thanks

,underoath281,2008-11-08T16:06Z,"I saw this band last night at Fitzgerald's in Houston Texas.  

They played like 2 Choking Victim songs, and the rest were Leftover Crack, an amazing show dude."
,oh_woah,2009-06-03T08:09Z,Daaaaamn B! very. good.
,hijackit,2009-08-22T01:59Z,"The only ones really worth downloading are No Gods, Squatta's 7"", Money Changes Everything (unreleased) and Sweet Dreams (comp)  ... unless you like scratchy vinyl sound or live recordings. 

Overall, this is one kickass torrent and I'll be seeding for a few days. Thanks!"
