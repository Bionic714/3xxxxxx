,gza673,2009-04-02T00:06Z,"yeah that was really the most brilliant thing i've read all year.  cant spell ""divorced"" or ""nature""  but somehow he got lucky on  ""beautiful"""
,gza673,2009-04-02T00:07Z,"anyway, thanks for the upload, 2012"
,AvatarOfGaia,2009-07-03T09:41Z,"looks like a good mix of relaxing nature sound. Thanks. 
And for themercifulmp (the merciful moron prick...), if you work 12 hours a day, 6 days a week, you dont have to be a divorced whatever to need some relaxing sound and music to sleep. "

Thanks uploader for all the effort. If U feel U have done a good job...U have and please continue to do so. A fact that the critics (...themercifulmp) are commenting itself proves that they do wanna free stuff and hence are here...but wanna make their presence felt... hence non appreciable comments.... else I do not see any reason why they even are here in the first place"
,Truvbay,2010-04-03T18:04Z,"@aCe_vEnTuRa2: Did you really save much time writing ""U"" instead of ""you""? Its two extra letters. They're even on the same line on your keyboard. Maybe you should look into using fewer periods, and more letters. Eventually, ""U"" will leave high school, and I doubt employers will accept such abuse of the language. 

The up itself, however, is very good. Worth the download."
