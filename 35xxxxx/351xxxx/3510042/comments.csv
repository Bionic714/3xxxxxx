UTORRENT DOESNT DOWNLOAD THIS FILE 
well thats crap!!
i am using utorrent right now and it's downloading lol"
,351c,2007-01-28T14:49Z,"attention
Casmus, jamesjansson
there is a nocd patch in the download
i noticed this is an NRG FILE = ""nero image file""
Well i never use nero very much well fuck all..

i use alcohol 120% not a fan of nero

you say cant get the game to work, well this is why ""LOL""
and to those where it says: put in the correct CD-ROM! what should i do? 

I downloaded a NO-CD crack for this right now. How do I use it?

please read on all you noobs!

copy the nocd patch ""Gun.exe"" into the gun folder where ever you installed it and paste or copy in there and over write the old gun.exe file.
Now make a shortcut on the desktop or where ever you like. and wow it now works

1 tip for all you guys as i see this on forums everywhere! 

get yourselves a copy of isobuster, magic iso, ultra iso, power iso, etc

i use power iso to view all my game downloads befor i burn any game! i can modify them and add stuff like the crack, cheats, trainers, anything or even delete shit too if i want.

like some people never add the bloody crack lol. when they seed their games

always handy for that reason.

well i hope this has helped ya"

,kartel73,2007-10-29T10:56Z,Hey techno use the Utorrent loader and not bittorent. You will see the difference in downloading speed. Bit torrent loader blows. only allows like 1 and 2 kpbs and with uttorrent I get up to 120 kpbs.

,BatCool,2008-04-02T15:37Z,need any crack tho this?
,Tragonn,2008-04-04T18:24Z,Antagligen har de flesta som klagar på dålig download speed inte lärt sig att strypa sin upload till korrekt nivå. Om ni har 8 mbit adsl som jag så sätt upload till 20-30 kb/s. Jag får utmärkt hastighet.
,Tragonn,2008-04-04T18:52Z,"Reinkaos try this: Open dxdiag and go to sound options. Turn down the sound acceleration. Theres 4 levels. Lower it one at a time til you get sound(if it works).

About download speeds. Im getting 500kb/s down.
As I said in swedish. If you are getting just a few kb/s in download just cap your upload. I have 8mbit ADSL and I use 20-30kb/s in upload and I always have good speed."
,lol_davve,2008-04-25T15:19Z,"This game is very funny, I had it on PS2 a year ago but it was too short. Completed it in a week and played just about 1-2 h a day."
