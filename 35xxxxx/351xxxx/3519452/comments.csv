,wonderboy22,2006-09-04T21:59Z,Thanks for the info. kelken757 I would'nt have been able to do it without you!
,GokGokMeMok,2006-09-04T23:24Z,Giant Fag uploads a Azuerus...and not even a current version.  Shame.  :(
,Typooni,2006-09-05T09:37Z,Yeah. Latest is 2.5.0.0... Why upload this shit when you can download from Azureus site 1000 times faster and latest version?
,wonderboy22,2006-09-06T00:26Z,"Because if you DL it directly from Azureus, it won't be full of spyware ans viruses. Take a walk on the wild side! "
