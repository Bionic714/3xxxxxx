,Safariarkiv,2006-08-12T23:13Z,Republican bullshit encoded with WMA. Figures!
,nmne,2006-08-13T00:00Z,"if you want me to upload it in mp3 i can do that.  incidentally, i read both this and Michael Moore's ""Dude, Where's My Country?"" and i find them both to be extremist.  you just have to dig through the bullshit to get to the value."
,extrudedplasticdingus,2006-08-13T00:53Z,"There's a lot more substance to Moore's work than there is to Coulter's.  I haven't read this yet and would rather listen if she narrates.  Maybe that'll make it a little amusing.

So is it her?"
,Puny Human,2006-08-13T07:28Z,You ever notice that Ann Coulter has a very large adam's apple?  
,nmne,2006-08-15T17:36Z,It is indeed narrated by the author.
,Fubi,2006-09-25T01:54Z,Ann Coulter is a man. 
,TheUnUsualSuspect,2006-10-21T09:57Z,"If you ask me why so many liberals say nasty things about Ann Couter, it is because either they can't argue any of her points (she does very through research), or they just don't believe in free speech. (not sure which)

Regarding michael moore, most of his ""so called"" facts can be disproved as half truth, lies, or rumors.

This is what sets ann apart, she never states anything unless she can back it up.

And for her haters, please get a life...   She is an entertainer...   Change channels if you don't like her...

Now the true test of a persons charture is if they simply reply with their opinion, or reply calling her names and insulting her (calling her a man for example).

I have insulted no one here, but I expect I too will be insulted for speaking my opinion, as Ann is everyday of her life.

However, she contines to speak to sold out audiences, and gets paid big $$$ to do it.

If I was a woman, I would want to be her, but since I'm not, I guess I would want to be her husband...   :)"
,macrossroads,2006-10-26T04:37Z,"Actually, I don?t mind calling those who actually comment on this book BEFORE they read  (listen) to it the FUCKTARDS that they have proven themselves to be. Can?t be bothered to even LISTEN to this before chiming in with Moron Moore comparisons - Moore who prefers a Johnson over a Bush..."
,FredCPA,2006-11-20T13:18Z,Excellent post.  Thank you!
,peoplayer,2007-03-05T04:26Z,"UnsusualSuspect: Ann Coulter is pretty outspoken, and I'm not really sure she does ""thorough research"" as you say. A couple of quotes from her: 

""If you don't hate Clinton and the people who labored to keep him in office, you don't love your country.""---George, 7/99 

""We're now at the point that it's beyond whether or not this guy is a horny hick. I really think it's a question of his mental stability. He really could be a lunatic. I think it is a rational question for Americans to ask whether their president is insane.""---Equal Time 

""I think there should be a literacy test and a poll tax for people to vote.""---Hannity & Colmes, 8/17/99 

""I think [women] should be armed but should not [be allowed to] vote.""---Politically Incorrect, 2/26/01 

""If those kids had been carrying guns they would have gunned down this one [child] gunman. ... Don't pray. Learn to use guns.""---Politically Incorrect, 12/18/97

""I have to say I'm all for public flogging. One type of criminal that a public humiliation might work particularly well with are the juvenile delinquents, a lot of whom consider it a badge of honor to be sent to juvenile detention. And it might not be such a cool thing in the 'hood to be flogged publicly.""---MSNBC 3/22/97

""Anorexics never have boyfriends. ... That's one way to know you don't have anorexia, if you have a boyfriend.""---Politically Incorrect 7/21/97 

The list goes on... she does NOT do her homework, she babbles about stuff she doesn't understand, and is generally pretty arrogant."
,pinkincide,2007-07-21T10:23Z,"MUCH of what Ann says is HYPERBOLE--obvious exaggerations statements to make a point.  http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/hyperbole

Quite funny in their original context, but extreme sounding when purposefully taken out of context, as they constantly are by left wing websites.  If Coulter said she could eat a horse the daily Kos would charge her with animal cruelty.  When she deals with FACTS she meticulously footnotes her sources.  It's a night and day difference that leftists willfully ignore."
,TheUnUsualSuspect,2007-10-16T02:41Z,"Very well put ""pinkincide"".

As I said, Ann is an entertainer, and she is popular because she says outrageous things.

If you notice (peoplayer), all of your quotes were her expressing her opinion, and as (pinkincide) states, they are all said to be humor. 

What I was referring to, is when she quotes someone, states a law, or other fact, she can back it up, unlike Micheal Moore, who makes statements that have no basis in fact, and refuses to provide any proof, or reveal his source (which is his imagination). He nearly changed the outcome of a presidential election with a hollywood film, and some people actually believed what was in his film...   now those people shouldn't be allowed to vote (in my opinion).

Thank you very much for this torrent"
,BigBlackDog3,2008-06-18T02:03Z,thanks
,Animal1000000,2008-12-01T05:47Z,"
I found many of the posts amusing. Michael Moore and Ann Coulter are twins, seperated at birth. That Americans put up with them, tells you what is wrong with the Excited States. "
,Whiskey6,2009-01-23T07:43Z,"I read this book, Coulter does indeed back up her statements with facts, unlike those who bash her on a regular basis.  Much lime Limbaugh who is also routinely accused of falsehoods by the liberal left.  Funny thing about Limbaugh is that when he slams some dimwit like Harry Reid or Nan Pelosi, he usually just records their statements and plays them back, in full, allowing the libs to show themselves to be idiots."
,wontgetfooledagain1,2009-02-01T15:52Z,"Ann narrates!

By the way, I beat off to this. I usually cum around Chapter 3.

Just thought you'd want to know. ^_^"
,H4rryP4lmer,2009-02-23T21:43Z,"If you notice, most of the extreme comments are made when she is on Politically Incorrect.  A comedy based political show.  What type of comments would you expect?  I would expect comical, politically incorrect comments.  Wake up and smell the jokes!"
,pssyluvr,2011-05-06T10:05Z,"Michael Moore is a fucking moron, that spews nothing but lies from his fat fucking pig jowls. Ann Coulter is awesome! She survived dating Satan himself, also known as Bill Maher. You gotta give her some credit for that alone. She tells it like it is and some people can't handle it. Most people can't handle the truth. "
