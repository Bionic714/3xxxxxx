Notes: 
The DVD contains a bootleg of the complete Seigmen and Motorpsycho performances at the
Quart festival in Kristiansand, Norway from July 9th 1993. 
This DVD was discovered for sale on a Norwegian record fair in late 2005. 
A fan somehow managed to avoid paying the steep price, but instead borrowed & secretly 
copied it for it to be liberated now (thanks!). The sound is unfortunately terrible, 
you should have a good idea what is going on there to actually enjoy the music but 
the great footage makes up for that: Great unobstructed vision all way through, 
supposedly shot from a gallery of some kind, decent close ups & all band members 
get a fair share of closeups & equal camera time. 
This is an incredible item all in all -- very well worth a fan's time.
