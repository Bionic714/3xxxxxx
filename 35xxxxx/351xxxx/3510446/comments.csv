If i'll download this ""DVD-Rip"" and it will be having that sucky quality sound that your releases always have... i'll see to it that you don't ever again call your releases ""DVD-Rip""... Where as they are reversed TC's/TS's.. with the picturequality top-notch.. but soundquality catastrophioc (on the paper its good (112kbs)... but the recordingsource is rubbish...

Please make a note or something in the release when sound isn't ripped from dvd. Lets see now how this movie compares to the bunch,."

now. just foget that everything in PC world is Plug & Play. sometimes you've to install or set up something.

START.

1 - Just forget about your Windows Media Player. it's crap. I've tested almost all kind of media players. one of them is reaaly good. and that is VLC media Player. VLC media player is a highly portable multimedia player for various audio and video formats (MPEG-1, MPEG-2, MPEG-4, DivX, mp3, ogg, ...) as well as DVDs, VCDs, and various streaming protocols.
You can DL it from here : (for Windows ) http://www.videolan.org/vlc/download-windows.html 
for other OP systems , please check the home site : http://www.videolan.org/vlc/


2 - you need some filters or codecs. these work like translator for your PC, Which sysytem shold play how!?
one of these are AC3 filter. it enable your system to play Dolby and DTS sound system.

DL AC3 Filter from here , then install it : 
http://ac3filter.net/index.php?name=Sections&req=viewarticle&artid=5

3 - one of the video formats is Xvid. XviD is an MPEG-4 compatible codec, which produces very good video quality -- something that really competes with DivX. 
DL from here, then install it : http://www.afterdawn.com/software/video_software/codecs_and_filters/xvid.cfm

4 - the most usual, powerful and popular format is Divx.
DL and install it from here : http://www.divx.com/

*** When you have all these codecs and filters, then it doesn't matter which Media player you use. these codecs will be in you PC forever.

that's all for today. any question?

( I'll send this to all aXXo releases )"
,bimusia,2006-10-09T00:25Z,"thanks, that was a very big help:-) now I can enjoy watching movies:-) bye bye:-)"

,redhead84,2006-12-31T10:24Z,"I dunno if this means anything to anyone else, but i just received an email saying that two of the torrents i downloaded from this site, (jackass 2 and barnyard, both from aXXo) 

were traced back to my ip address. Should i be worried? I also just subscribed to a group thing that i am pretty sure aXXo is affiliated with.

As is appears, aXXo is done. We will no longer be posting movies, and 

will rarely, if ever, visit this page. Sorry everyone. But who knows... 

we may put a movie up once in a while, or we may return. 


Thanks for all your support,

So, does anyone have a take on this? Did some big shit go down? Has anyone else gotten one of these? I dunno what to think. Please reply. I love all of aXXo's releases, i hate to think that i cant download them anymore cuz ""the man"" is watching. 


HELP!?!

,Magic_friendly,2012-08-08T08:39Z,"Sucks he gives it away to anyone who ACTUALLY hasn't seen this movie. This guy uploaded it in 2006 and it's 2012 already... But, no he is partially wrong. This movie is NOT called The Wrong Man. He is a moronic piece of shit who can't read. The name IS Lucky Number Slevin. He's just a guy who was in the wrong place at the wrong time and you watch events unfold and twists in the story plot will make you go =O WOAH! How hard is that? No spoilers at all. =) Thanks man.
