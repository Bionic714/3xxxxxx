This is the really bad Chinglish subtitled version of Star Wars episode 3 that floated around for a while online.  There was a torrent that was of the DVD files, but this is a small AVI that clocks in at about 700 MB for a faster download.  Plus, this one has a working source.


See http://winterson.com/2005/06/episode-iii-backstroke-of-west.html for the story behind this version of the film and several screenshots.  This is one of the funniest sources of unintentional humor I've seen in a while.
