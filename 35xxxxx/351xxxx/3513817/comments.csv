,crippa45,2006-08-20T18:40Z,Så här löser man problemet: I KeyGeneratorn - högerklicka - markera allt = så får ni med alla 48 tecken.

Can someone that is having success please generate a key and send it to me in an e-mail?  buddyhackit9@hotmail.com

Thanks."
,VaryX,2006-09-16T23:17Z,the keygen that came with mine doesn't have columns or anything like that in it.  How the heck can I copy column 1 if there's 0 columns?

,tagomago23,2008-07-28T20:25Z,"Awesome upload! Many thanks... had a bit of a problem with the keygen but I double cilcked, hit control + A, then control + C, then pasted it in the field using control +V. worked perfectly. "
,Booga23,2009-02-25T23:35Z,"OK just had to re-install this amazing program after PC wipe.
I have been using this for well over a year and it is great.
The keygen does work you just cant see and therefore select all the digits.
Right click in the window, click select all, right click again and copy, then right click in the first code box and paste.

Many thanks to Hubberz
