,mrcorytrevor,2006-08-17T20:03Z,5.05GB when opening i Toast?
,bobbysdad,2006-08-18T04:29Z,"It's just not worth it unless you can burn this to a dual layer dvd. It's a waste of 4.27GB of valuable d/l quota otherwise. Once un-rared this WILL NOT fit on a standard single layer dvd. I've tried all sorts of suggestions from Restoring it to a partition, then trying to install it that way, but it simply WON'T BOOT on a G4 800 12 inch iBook or a G4 500 14 inch TiBook. Don't d/l ANYTHING unless it's a complete Disc Image, and known to fit on a single layer DVD. If it's RAR, then it probably wasn't done on a Mac. Be careful everyone. Anyone with a real working workaround, please post."
,grzgrz,2006-08-18T07:46Z,"This image DOES WORK!
You need to burn it with Disk Utility. IF you burn with Toast the boot will fail at te spinning gear screen. You do need a dual layer DVD!
This is apparently a release earlier/less mature than the version that was used for the keynote since iChat Theater is missing.Â 
TimeMachine backups are intolerably slow but the interface is cool.
Spaces allows up to 16 workspaces, not just the 4 Steve demoed.
"
,coinKid,2006-08-18T11:49Z,I guess one could restore it to a firewire harddisk and have the Mac booting from it. I have done it before and it worked for Macs that could not read DVDs. This is a PPC version. Isn't it?
,kildjean,2006-08-19T01:16Z,Could someone re-seed this? I am at 99.7% done and been stuck at this for over a week.
,etherghost,2006-08-20T03:31Z,"what is this??

I downloaded it, got a folder with a  rar, a bunch of .rXX files.

I double click the .rar (iver got rarexpander, and all I get is an empty folder osx-leobeta.

Is the the PC 9n ppc) file?"
,carlco,2006-08-21T17:15Z,"for christ sakes what the hell are you posting this for ? its a beta its incomplete it does nothing but hog the bandwidth , the only person that this torrent would be any use to is bill gates and his legriders at redmund"
,mrcorytrevor,2006-08-23T17:23Z,what are you on about? large scale beta testing benefits all.

It's not the best idea to download/upload Mac beta crap. They pride themselves in shitting down your neck if you break the nda

,milodeescorpion19,2006-08-26T06:42Z,"here's a guide for installing it on ppc's and intels
without a DL DVD
Note: G3s are not supported by Leopard

,camgangrel,2006-09-02T07:04Z,"This one does work I am using to right now.
You have to burn it to a DL-DVD to make it work.
Use the disk tool in OS X 10.4 to make it bootable.
I know I used toast and it would not boot.
thank you to who ever put this up!!!"
,rdoger6424,2006-09-05T16:22Z,"so it's too big to fit on a regular DVD? I guess I should have bought the dual layer superdrive. I suppose I'll buy leopard. :D, but in a way, D:"
,binglax09,2006-09-10T22:42Z,"Instead of messing with DL-DVDs or any type of slow media for that fact, just back up your iPod and load the image onto it with firewire. Once the image is ""burned"" to the iPod restart and boot off of firewire. This is takes a hell of a lot less time and if you dont have a DVD burner your all set. "
,badapple18,2006-09-21T22:13Z,"can't wait to get home and give it a try, ipod is a great idea only if you have an older firewire ipod 4th gen or older"
,Pismo500,2006-09-25T00:34Z,So I took the original Disk image and created an empty disk image and cloned it minus the dev tools and burned it.Then I used the disk utility to burn it and it got only so far when I tried to boot from the DVD (single layer)... What did I do wrong and what has to be removed to get it to work on a G3 - if that is true? Thanks in advance...
,Sith1ord,2006-09-25T06:27Z,"""Spaces allows up to 16 workspaces, not just the 4 Steve demoed.""

I'm assuming its a Universal App for both PPC and Intel chipsets, but Spaces and other things just sound like they ripped from the dozens of awesome original freewares people have made previously :( i hope they at least paid those people"
,mr.know,2006-09-29T22:23Z,"Please seed guys!!!

Thanks in advance."

[V],felch,2006-11-28T21:03Z,"Guys - when uploading ANY mac system software it should be obvious which architecture you are uploading for.  There are only really two main options:
 * powerpc series (G3, G4, G5)
 * Intel

Which is this one?????"
,ben boyd,2006-12-01T12:40Z,I think you'll find that Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard is universal.
,JonoOrgill,2007-02-09T18:53Z,If you're using this on your mac it should have a firewire port and you should have an ipod.  All you do is use disk utility to write the file image (after you've unrared it) onto your ipod and then boot from it.  No disks required.
,yashrg,2007-02-14T05:28Z,someone please seed this. there are three other people stuck at 21.8 percent!!!

,djjuice,2007-06-12T15:21Z,"I hope everyone downloading this knows this IS NOT the version that was shown at the 2007 WWDC, i'm guessing you didnt look at the upload date 8-2006, its from last year, this is the FIRST leopard build. You're just wasting your time"
,jazzg4,2007-06-13T21:21Z,"THIS NOT NEWEST VER OF LEOPARD
this have no  new dock finder or quick look

the download work but it like tiger on drugs.
i would not download this at all ."
,ultrapiratebuffer,2007-06-14T16:33Z,"### THIS IS A EARLY BETA ###
### NOT THE STUFF YOU SAW AT THE KEYNOTE ###

even though it was told here before, people are seeding and leeching an old old beta version with a lots of bugs and like no working features.

do not download this, except for curiousity. NONE of the cool things shown at WWDC are in this build.

if i'm correct the version shown at the WWDC was build ""9A466"" not this one, wich is like 9A400 or sth.

so, save trouble and bandwith and wait until the WWDC is over and one of the developers return home and upload the new one :)
