Since its foundation in 1996, the Amsterdam Klezmer Band has evolved explosively. Starting as a trio that mostly played in the bars and on the streets of Amsterdam, they now are popular guests at numerous international festivals, dance events and pop clubs. The sound of the band is exclusively Oriental. With the heritage of Klezmer music, the intensity of a punk band and the inspiration of all kinds of Gypsy and Balkan dance music, the seven musicians leave their audiences astonished and covered with sweat after frantic dancing. The band performs their own music but has also collaborated with various groups over the last few years: The Galata Gypsy Band from Turkey, Shantel (Bucovina Club), 
Zuco 103 (a new collaborative effort), C-mon & Kypski and the contemporary 
jazz trio Man Bites Dog are just a few examples.

After 10 years of live performances and the release of 9 albums (including 
joint productions) they were looking for a new way of displaying their musical 
tastes. After some shared club dates with DJs and creative experiments with 
drum computers and samplers the idea arose to invite some exciting DJs and 
producers to work on their material. Now here is the result: Amsterdam 
Klezmer Band Remixed!
