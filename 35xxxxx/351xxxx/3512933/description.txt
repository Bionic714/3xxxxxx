Putumayo does it again with an incredible collection of tunes from reggae artists around the world. South Africa, Australia, Brazil, Sudan, Mali, Nigeria, France, Ghana, USA, and of course Jamaica are all represented in this collaborative album. My personal favorite was Peter Rowan, the former guitarist and vocalist for bluegrass legend Bill Monroe, doing his Americanized rendition of the Bob Marley classic "No Woman No Cry" backed by bluegrass legends like Mark O'Connor and Jerry Douglas. The low point of the album was jazz/reggae fusion guitarist Ernest Ranglin's instrumental "Stop That Train" where a few notes are less than stellar. Still, the concept of an instrumental approach to reggae is an interesting one and lends further credence to the notion that reggae is a state of mind. The attached booklet gives you a good introduction to the artists and the songs to help broaden your horizons on this musical genre. Highly recommended.
