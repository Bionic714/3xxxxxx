OK.  If I did it right, you should be DL'ing the second episode in this new series.  You can find all the info about it at ( www.TV.com ) and search for "Three moons over Milford".  I also have put up the first (pilot) episode on TPB.  Look for it.  I'll put more up as I find them.  They are in Xvid format.  Have fun.
