Putumayo Records Presents:
Best of Folk Music  1993
Rip 320kbs
Covers included

Putumayo World Music was established in 1993 to introduce people to the music of the world's  cultures. The label grew out of the Putumayo clothing company, founded by Dan Storper in 1975 and sold in 1997. 
In the past ten years, Putumayo World Music has become known primarily for its upbeat and melodic compilations of great international music characterized by the company's motto: ?guaranteed to make you feel good!? Putumayo?s CD covers feature the distinctive art of Nicola Heindl, whose colorful, folkloric style represents one of Putumayo's goals: to connect the traditional to the contemporary. By combining appealing music and visuals with creative retail marketing, Putumayo has developed a unique brand identity - a rarity in today's artist-based music industry.
