,Grimberg,2006-11-19T21:54Z,"Label the CD 2 as Orkester when you burn it and there you go!
But CD 3 is a mystery! Have tried several ways. As SOUNDCD, SOUND CD, FACTORY, but with no luck...
Please try forward and let us know if some of you got it right! :)"
,Grimberg,2006-11-19T22:22Z,"All is done!
Just do the following and you can use it. Just tried it, and it works like hell:)

Download PowerISO. In the PowerISO ""tools"" menu, set the number of virtual drives to 3. Mount the first Image (Reason 3.0 CD 1.daa) on the first drive. Second on the second and third on the third.3. From the first disc, double click ""install reason"". As long as you have the second and third discs mounted, they will install automatically when the first has finished.After that, run the program and use one of the 2 serials provided in the read me file

GO NUTS!"

,Deezo_m1,2007-05-13T17:02Z,"Well I have just installed with no probs without even burning a cd ...

For you guys having trouble try this :)

Use Alcohol 120%

Click on 'Image finder'

Alcohol will then find the the 3 reason iso's from your reason folder

Now right click on each one and select 'add selected files to alcohol 120%'

when all three are added just click on the 1st and away it goes .... when it askes for the 2nd disc just click on it in alcohol 120% and off it goes again ...same with the 3rd

then its serial number time ... then just click on the 3.04 update in the disc 1 folder and that goes to work :)


Now i just have to work out how to use the f....kin thing :O)"
,yentertainment,2007-06-20T16:58Z,"The Winrar file is the actualy ISO file that you need to mount or burn, for those who have problems with that, don't unpack it and burn the contents onto a cd, that won't work.  anyways, I lost my reason key, can anyone help me out?"

,baby_cyanide,2008-04-19T20:58Z,"follow these instructions and it will be real easy

1) install the Virtual Clone Drive
   - the virtual clone drive is there to trick your computer into thinking you have a disc in your computer when you actally dont
   - it burns the image of a disc on to your computer, this is known as ""mounting"" the file.

2) the next step is to install Reason
   -open the Reason folder
   -open the Reason 3.0 CD1 folder
   -open the Reason 3.04 folder
   -install Reason

3) after it installs, you are instructed to enter the 1st disc
   -return to the Reason CD1 folder
   -double click Reason CD1 icon- then it installs the 1st disc

4) after thats done, you are instructed to enter the 2nd disc
   -open the Reason CD2 folder
   -double click on the icon- then it installs the 2nd disc

5) after thats done, you are instructed to enter the 3rd disc
   -open the Reason CD3 folder
   -double click on the icon- then it installs the 3rd disc

6) after that, the program asks for a password
   -open the New Text Document and choose the first password on the list and enter it

7) ok, its almost done- just follow directions."
