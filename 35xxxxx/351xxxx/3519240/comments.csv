,Pesci,2006-09-21T02:27Z,"One more thing. This same screening version of the film was in Google Video and it was sensored, taken out in less than 24 hours I belive! So demand Google to put it back there so people can see it."
[V],smartypants,2006-09-22T16:14Z,I think it was removed due to some copyright thing. 
,datars,2006-09-27T03:18Z,"I uploaded it to Google, and Aaron Russo's Team ask if I would remove it, so I did about 12 hours later."
,theblackbay,2006-10-03T11:50Z,"As soon as it's out on Dvd it's going to be everywhere anyhow i don't know why all the copyright paranoia, I know he's got to get his cash back, but it needs to get OUT and doing so will generate more cash, look how popluar Money masters became AFTER it was out on Google and places like this.

This idea of Copyright apart from the common law one is an old world Structure being added to a New Techology environment and it can't work there. MORE MONEY WILL BE MADE BY SPEADING THE FILM ASK ALEX JONES. "
[V],smartypants,2006-10-08T00:28Z,I agree with you a 100%

,kakballe,2006-10-28T03:33Z,"Wow, great film! Feels a lot more uptodate and easily accessible to present day man than the ""money masters"" och the ""capitalist conspiracy"".
Plus I like the fact that he markets an idea, and a solution: Vote for noone that doesn't want to bring the Federal Reserve down. Practice coupled to the theory. A simple and elegant solution to much of the worlds problems today, I believe, if we manage to unite our power and efforts enough.
But don't forget much of the rest of the world is cought in a similar trap .. we have to get a clear idea of the structure in every country to defeat these bastards."
,Culiptist03,2007-01-06T04:47Z,"This world is scary place.  Unfortunately there's nothing you can do about.  :) 

Your are a pawn!  You must answer to someone.  Not god(for now)! 

Original the U.S. was a country of unity. With unity there's strength, but are we really united?  Even the very fundamentals of our government is polarized (a vs. b).

This is not what our government was based upon.  

Once the world is forced into a one world gov. then a revolution will begin.  By then it will be WELL beyond or control.

,Art_Vendelay,2008-02-21T03:17Z,"oh & zakimar, u r gonna be waiting a long time for our economy to collapse, the richest assholes on the planet control the US.  if somehow magically our ecomy did collapse it would fuck things up for the countries that depend on the US economy, which is pretty much the entire world.  if china was running the planet for the last 70 years things would be so shitty, we deffinetly would not have this wonderful internet.  u think america lies to its populous, china is about 100 times worse..."
,kennethsaksee,2008-03-04T08:55Z,"I agree with al of you that had to say something about our corrupted gov.  Although, where's the love at?  I don't getthis no more.  Thank you. "
,Amerifox,2008-03-06T20:09Z,"Aye zakimar unfortunately its true, the richest assholes on the planet are using our country as a front for their own gain, we americans are beaten into a fearful closed-minded patriotic fervor only to be supportive of the fools in power, making us the ultimate fools, i was young when i watched the trade center fall, and remember hearing ""curse the pacifists for thier lack of patriotism and bringing this war upon us"" now years later and a bit more wiser and mature i understand the truth behind the matter, and am trying to learn the truth behind the world... all i know Zakimar is that its not just going to be america anymore... once china and india take ""power"" they will simply move thier front from our country to thiers, it may take them a while as it did with ""us"" but judging by what i know of human nature it will simply corrupt and happen again... we need something more than democracy... more than republic... and especially a change in total human psychology otherwise we will be doomed to repeat our mistakes again and again... we have evidence of a neuclear holocaust that happened an eon ago, radioactive bones EXTERMELY similar to our foolish mistakes on hiroshima and nagasaki, etc. I only wish my american peoples would wisen up and see the truth instead of hiding undera veil of fear and insecurity... however... if we are going to change or even save the world... thats how we will have to do it AS A WORLD, its up to us, the worlds people, not the aristocratic fools who think they know whats going on, yet are dooming us to repeat thier mistakes again and again... and what is it for? a better world? not for us... but for them..."
,Amerifox,2008-03-06T20:12Z,"id like to add another speil... The only thing we can do to help these facists is do nothing at all! Never say we can't do anything for we are men and women and we are alive, and if they are men and woman and are alive AND have done something then there is no reason that we cant do something too. We are many and they are few, all we can do for now is get the word out, change the minds of the people EVERYWHERE not just your own country, from complacent to open-minded, and then come together as a whole of humanity, I say xenophobia and a discrimination is nothing but a falicy, a burden on the growth of the human being as a whole And now that the world has become smaller (metaphorically) with flight and that the information world has become more diverse, we only have more power to come together, more strength then ever before, i say ignroe the disinformationists and the sceptics, and allow them to come to mind of thier own time when theyre ready, but as for us, those who are willing to work together... those who are willing to become HUMAN we can rise up and make the world a better place for all... not just the better place for some! Eventually everyone will come with us, i know in my heart theres a better way than what these silver-spooners are doing, and i may be a spoiled-assed american but i am trying, i am trying to do what i can for everyone, and everything for that matter, and i think we should all join together, as a band of all people not just a group under another group, a round table to a square one, a flat plane to a pyramid, true equallity is our last hope as a human race, lest we be doomed to repeat our past mistakes... oh and dont take my speculations as gospel, take them, think about them, and make your own, but for the love of all things be open-minded about it! And remember ""Our observations are only as good as the tools we use to observe them with"" Keep this in mind and the veils of lies will gradually rise to the truth, whether it be wisdom or not."

,eastern876,2008-06-03T10:26Z,"If you are interested in Russo's film, you will probably also be extremely interested to get the following torrent:

In the 1980s, radio station KABC carried the ground-breaking radio program ""OPEN MIND"" with host Bill Jenkins.   The subject matter covered included UFOs, alternative energy, spirituality, ancient religions, and more.   Bill Jenkins later went on to host the classic film ""THE NAKED TRUTH"" with Jordan Maxwell, upon which the current internet hit ""ZEITGEIST"" is based.

The ""Open Mind"" radio programs have not been heard in many years ... until now.   We recently came into possession of a large collection of cassette tape recordings which had been made by a loyal listener, and had them digitized into MP3s.  This is a priceless collection of otherwise unattainable radio programs.   It is being freely shared here in an effort to make sure it is not lost to  history.

,Tsundere,2008-07-23T19:03Z,"The quality of the torrent is good, both audio and video. However, Russo's manner of speaking is annoying, he sounds like his mouth is constantly full and jumbles words, making the bits with his narration almost unwatchable. This film will appeal mostly to the libertarian crowd, also probably some ""fiscally responsible"" repubs. "
,h.alex56,2008-08-17T11:06Z,"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. ? That *to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men*...

Just a reminder :) Great torrent, the movie plays properly, thank you all for seeding."
,Pug_Fugly,2008-09-10T16:15Z,"Fucking right, 244 seeds and 329 peers. I was hoping the internet community would be actively trying to do something about this. Ive watched this film now 3 times on google video. I'm downloading it now so I can burn it to several hundred discs along with Zeitgeist and wake some people out of this delusional fantasy they all live in.

Added to that, if there are any other Christians out there that read this, try to get this out to the people in your and/or your parents' and/or your siblings' churches. Tell your pastor you'd like a moment to speak, and tell them about this video and the information it presents. Tell them that Russo did the research himself, He heard the truth out of Nicholas Rockefeller's own mouth, that he put this video up himself for free on google video, and sells the DVD for $1. That he made sure that even after his death it would be available to buy in bulk. And get these churches, if they're not just a bunch more of brainwashed sheep (...wait, it's a church, what am I saying?) get those churches to put out weekly collections to buy this DVD in bulk, so we can start handing it out everywhere to everyone.

I don't know how much time is left to be honest, everything is uncertain and clouded. At the same time as this is going on, we know for certain that aliens exist! UFO's are interplanetary spaceships, and they've been visiting us! Chemtrail operations from the US Air Force are worldwide; people are dying because of them. Storms are rising, and HAARP is doing what it can to stop them, the audacity.

Please don't just watch this and forget about it. Get everyone you know to watch it, and believe it, and think deeply about what it means and how far it reaches. It's the single most important thing for the US and the world at large."
