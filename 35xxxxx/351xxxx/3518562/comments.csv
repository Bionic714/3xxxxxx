Thanks for the share.

I have actually got this documentary and watched it, but was looking for a better quality than google provides.

For such a subject as this documentary reveals, it is brilliantly done in it's simplicity in not attempting to overstate the evidence and simply allows you to reconcile what has been done in the supposed name of democracy. As an individual on this planet, it is vital that you know what is truly being done by 'governments' and the war crimes that they commit against all of us.

Thanks to whoever is seeding this, I appreciate it and will continue to seed it as well."
