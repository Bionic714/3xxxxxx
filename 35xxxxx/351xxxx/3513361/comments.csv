[T],Booster2,2007-10-31T23:27Z,"atlana said: I wish i'd know what tools/settings Axxo uses to make those fine quality XviDs.

No offence but Axxo's version of ""The Sentinel"" has bad sound quality & less resolution than mine. Axxo's audio quality is ""MP3 48000Hz 96 kb/s"". 96 Kb/s??!! That's bad. I've even encoded my own version and it has MP3 48000Hz CBR 192 Kb/s with a resolution in 640 x 272. That's a bit different."
,n8h,2007-11-30T10:03Z,He encodes them the way he does so they fit on a single cd. useful for divx supported dvd players. Plus he's just a kid
