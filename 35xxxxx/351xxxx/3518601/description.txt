A world's first: watch videos and movies on yourTomTom GO navigation system. Turn your navigation device into a portable media and entertainment centre. Movies, recorded TV and any other video can be converted and watched on the TomTom GO, in great quality, in full screen, with excellent sound. A memorycard as small as 128 Mb is enough to store a couple episodes of a tv-series, a full length feature film, or a hundred minutes of your home movies. Let your children watch their favourite TV-cartoons in the car or watch a blockbuster movie while travelling for business. The software installs an encoding package on a Windows XP computer, users pick a video file from their harddrive, CD or DVD and with only two clicks, the software turns it into a very small movie file, which will play on the Makayama video player on the TomTom. Subtitled and foreign language DVDs are also supported. Software runs on: Windows XP/2000/NT/Vista and the following TomTom models: TOMTOM GO, GO 300, GO 500, GO 700 (TomTom One and Rider will be supported later).
