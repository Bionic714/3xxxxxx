Putumayo Presents:
Africa 1999
A joyous celebration of music from an extraordinary continent.  
Rip 192kbs
Fcover included.

One cannot overstate the influence Africa has had on music of the world. Jazz, blues, rock and roll, gospel, salsa, samba, funk, hip-hop, reggae, zydeco, zoukÐthe list of genres which have roots in African music is endless. Africa is home to a myriad of styles, and it remains one of the most creative places for music on the planet. 
Tradition still plays an important role in today's African music, yet increasingly influences from around the world are making themselves heard. Ironically, many of the foreign music styles that have been most influential on today's African music have African origins. They are merely long lost relatives returning home. You will hear echoes of jazz, reggae, hip- hop, funk and salsa in the songs included on this collection. 
Once you have listened to Africa we hope you are inspired to explore further the richness and variety of African music.
