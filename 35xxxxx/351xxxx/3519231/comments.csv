,Tonttu86,2006-09-04T12:16Z,"Now this would be nice game, if RELOADED wouldn't have screwed the crack. 

The crack is modified Polish version exe (because the polish version doesn't have starforce), so it has some bugs, like your crew doesn't always come help you in boarding battles, so you get zerged by about 30 enemy soldiers and your crew can't aim shit with cannons and they do poor damage... so just a heads up."
,Tonttu86,2006-09-04T12:19Z,"Oh and with bugs I mean that the english and polish versions are a little different structurally, I think. :P"
,Tonttu86,2006-09-04T15:14Z,Well that sucks then...
,vigeza,2006-09-04T18:16Z,Please somebody seed
,elrancido,2006-09-04T18:20Z,"take it easy, it got on TPB 11.21 today so ofcourse it will take awhile before people got it"
[T],Knaster,2006-09-04T19:22Z,"Tonttu86 your crew gets better the more exp and loyalty u get and if you have an officer with good gunnery skill this is no""bug""."

,elrancido,2006-09-04T20:46Z,"He is seeding, but it will take awhile before more people get it.  im at 40% and 75kb/s that fast enough."
,tomazahlin,2006-09-04T22:05Z,i love swedish uploaders :D... btw nightspydk thank you very much
,Tonttu86,2006-09-04T23:54Z,"My crew was masterful, and I even tried to add 
all the skill points to accuracy to see if it made any noticeable difference, it didn't...seems you have to manually aim the cannons (in the deck mode) if you want something to be done properly. 

The exe that was used for the crack is 1.0.0.1 or something similar version and the whole game is supposed to be 1.4.

In the menu it shows 1.4 and all the files are from 1.4 version except the cracked exe. Nice going. I hope reloaded releases a fixed crack soon. :P"
[T],Knaster,2006-09-05T01:16Z,Tonttu but aiming manually is what ive always have done it's much more realistic and gratifying seeing the cannon ball cutting down a mast from that view :). Hmm but it isnt that hard to aim auto not for me anyways yeah sure u dont hit with every gun perhaps but that wasn't the case in real life either. But if you are close enough for a broadside u wont miss i promise u that.
,nightspydk,2006-09-05T01:56Z,"That the crack has anything to do with cannon accuracy beats me I confess.

Tonttu86 when you initially create your caracter you can further increase realism. If you somehow done that, it might get really hard. The last installment wasn't easy at first either. The safe way I found was to trade to get a nice vessel. Upgrade cannons. Get a 1st class crew and then engage. Demands piles of gold obviously.

To the second seeder thanks whoever you are. :)

tomazahlin you are welcome my friend. :)
Swedish no I wish though.

About the engine.exe problem.
Read readme.txt. 
-Check minimun requirements.
- Set everything low. Disable AA,AF run at crap resolution, refresh. Disable sound. See if it runs.
- Try ""safe mode"" (start->programs->....)

You are running Windows XP?

Else there isn't much we can do about it, though it does seem there might be a problem with the game.
Nothing to do with this version.
Does indeed need a patch or several."

,enaceo,2006-09-11T12:30Z,"killme15 one less seeder ain't going to kill nobody so you can go wherever you want.
I have installed the game today , and it works with no problems.No crack problems, no crew problems , NO NOTHING PROBLEMS.
Crashing after intro-screen problems with games that have 3d-renderd menus or images in the menus like Hitman:Bloodmoney or AOP are most likely caused by graphics cards not supporting either DX9 or Pixel Shader 3.0 or whichever this game is using.
The crack supplyed by RLD is not the problem, your computer IS.
If you don't belive me when I say this game is working , I can give you whatever proof you want.
Write hte game to DVD and go to a friend or relative with a better computer and see if it works there.
So other people,the game works for me.Thanks again RLD for a great release ,and the uploader for ... well..uploading:D
The release is fine , you computer might not be if the game is not working."

,roysh21,2006-09-11T16:14Z,"Dear Enaceo,
It seems that for some poeple, myself included, the crack wasnt extracted properly from the RAR files and is the cause of a crash error, regardless of users graphic card. I, for one, can guarantee you that my crad supports the latest DirectX version, as  Im running all the latest games, such as ""Oblivion"", ""Call of Juarez"" and ""Battlefield 2""

so if all you have is ""Its not me its you"" response it would have been better to say nothing at all...  "
,killme15,2006-09-11T17:21Z,teah enaceo if your goin to try and blow our graphic cards which isnt the problem SHUT THE FUCK UP BITCH
,enaceo,2006-09-11T17:56Z,"roysh21 , I am sorry for that . You are indeed correct , ther might also had been a problem with the archives , but since you said the instalation worked, I figured they were ok.
There was the same problem with people with many other games ,and in the end it was the card not supporting something in many of the cases.
But , if you say it is not the computer, then I am sorry that I forgot to mention this possibility.
As you see in the last sentecnce of my post , I say the release is fine , because it works for me , but the comptuer MIGHT be wrong .I did not say it IS the problem.I am sorry if that is what you understood.
Again, sorry for being so ... direct .
Mr killme15 , you are an asshole and can go to hell.
I was just trying to help .Thank you for being a n00b and making my day .I really needed to laugh at some moron as he tries to say how right he is and how wrong everyone else is .
I know a lot of things about compter software and computers in general , so don't start to say that ""oooh you are wrong n00b go away !1! haha fuck off you stupid me rullzor "" and other crap like that ,because I Do know what I am talking about.
And ,mr killme15 , remember , that now you are doing something against the law ,and could even go to jail in some countries for this.
You could always go to the shop and buy the game you n00b , but you decide to download it .
Instead of thanking this community for what it does , you swear at other people , and act like a complete n00b.If the admins of the site were bad ,they could easily take our Ip's , report to the authorities and I guess you know what might happen next.But they don't do that , and they support n00bs like you.(In this last sentence I am only talking to killme15 , all other people , I am not saying you are n00bs or assholes for downloading here and not buying the game .Again , my apologies for being so dirrect ,and again thanks killme15 for making my day )"

,Thoux,2006-09-11T23:00Z,"lol killme 15! 
I've just read the whole line of posts through...
Are you?... like... kinda retarded?
You get kinda personal in you last post and I guess I do too.
Have you indeed been raped in your ass by someones mom since you so passionately want to return the favor?
you say you've JUST accuired a geForce 6200...? quit bragging omfgimbapwnz0rz! hax that you've just gotten hold on such a powerstation of a GFx card... 
the 6200 is from 2004 and was launched with a special turbo cache edition in december 2004 as a MAINSTREAM card, so do not expect it to run newer games!
The industry has a tradition of inventing new standards all the time and the software industry of making these things requirements even if the game theoreticly could be run without it.

here I am rounding off with a somewhat decent post even it I just wanted to tell you to stfu!

... and geforce 7950 ftw! only got one though so no quad SLi :(

grow up!
get mature!
get some kind of job!
then you gan buy this kind of gear if you like me have no life and got no better things to spen your hard earned cash on... :P

BUT REMEMBER kill(somethingsomething)15:
ppl here are in NO WAY obligated to do your technical supprt for games you download illegally. If it doesent work for you, or your 1337 gerforce 6200 and you can't make it work from any og the posts here, then LEAVE IT. look for a demo and see if it works or just simply buy ot!
IF YOU'VE BOUGHT A GAME AND MEET DEMANDS YOU CAN COMPLAIN...
releases like this... cheers at the release groups and the guys who seed! don't be so negative and flame ppl that are really putting an effort in posting a contructive reply!

lol I could go on... I hate forum posters like you! unintelligent, tempered and attention seeking youngsters who sounds like the'll just end up in a gang and on drugs so they can really blame society for ther crappy life.
and here I am going on... you just tipped my cup and I had to let it out :)"
,racenutalways,2006-09-11T23:04Z,"finally got it working, 4th swing, home run, LOL
once it's unpacked, open the iso file with magicISO or equal, extract crack folder to desktop(find it easy). mount iso file with daemon tools. do this in order, open crack folder, copy engine.exe, paste to C:/program files/playlogic/age of pirates carribean tales, you will get confirmation if done properly.
  Next, open modules folder in the crack folder, copy location.dll, paste to c:/program files/playlogic/ageof pirates carribean tales/modules folder, confirm. Do the exact thing with xinterface.dll file, confirm.
 Copy entire Program folder, from the crack folder. Paste to C:/program files/playlogic/age of pirates carribean tales folder.
I had to uninstall and redo all those steps 4 times, and voila, it works just fine.

Well,for someone who has been doing ""this shit"" for 3 years   , whatever that must be , stealing games from the internet or other things like that , you surely haven't learned shit.
1st of all ,no one should help you if the game don't work , and you would go to jail if not for this community and it's supporters.
2.The 6200 is a low -end card by now , and I would not be surprised if that is the problem.
3.How long did it take you to make up that last post? Considering your IQ , ust've been quite some time ... I like the way you made the things you said make so much sence .You are probably some 12 year old kid who barely found out what that thing in his pants is and is saying he's omfg haxor leet  because he dwlds games from the internet .
Oh,and also, there are abou 3-4 releases of thisd game , so if you are so omfgleet haxor you can dwld all of them you prick.
If you would've been nice ,and not act like a fucking retard , maybe you would've gotten help  , but since you act like an asshole , the only thins you will get is probably a ban and swearing from other people."

,enaceo,2006-09-14T09:24Z,"Lol I can imagine you laughing ""hahahahaha"" with your mouth open just waiting for a cock to come in .
And oh I can't right , but ""dumass"" and ""assho;e"" are very well spelled right?
And I don't give a damn if I can't spell , you asshole n00b.
Oh,I'm glad you discovered what that button ""caps lock "" does since you don't write all your swearing with captial letters now (that means big letters , like these ones : FUCK YOU  in case you don't understand)."
,enaceo,2006-09-14T09:28Z,"""are very well spelled right?"" - instead of right I meant wright .Just so you would understand you n00b since it would be too hard for you pea-sized brain to understand what I really wanted to say there .
Oh , and there's one more thing.I'm playing this game and having fun with it , while you are staying here , acting like a fucking idiot and not playing it n00b!
I've noticed the only things you can use to swear are "" fuck , motherfucker , dumass which isn't even spelled correctly , cock and that's about it "".That shows the amount of street-smarts you have in that pea- brain of yours .
You probably picked them up on some shitty Halo or CS server , when you were getting owned by other people with 0-39 score you fucking asshole."

And you should really stop saying that you had your way with peoples mothers.
That says more about you, than it does about them.
You're 17, enaceo's mom is probably 40-60 or something.

,GT_Jani,2006-09-20T17:39Z,its something wrong with the sea.dll file.....anyone who has a idea of correcting that?
,Xx~GameChronic~xX,2006-09-21T06:22Z,"yea when i removed the sea and island .dll it worked fine for me aswell but naturally the sea doesnt show some one that knows more then me forsure sould see if they can find the problem, if i only removed one of the .dlls it still crashed. ill continue to poke away at it but where its not happening to ppl with better PCs then it might be tough luck for us oldies with bare system reqirements like myself."
,GT_Jani,2006-09-21T11:26Z,thats right and every time it crashed i relocated one more of the dll file and the game worked forward......its kinda funny to have to remove files for it to work ;)

,Baztardo,2006-10-04T01:07Z,"Hi!
No problem making the game to work.
Just unrar the files with winrar, the mount the ISO file with deamontools. After that it will start to autoinstall. Then go to the fictive drive and explore the ISO, find the folder named Crack, and copy the files in the Modules folder, then paste and replace em in the gamefolder. Same as for the engine.exe and the folder program, just copy and paste them.

Then if the game doesn´t work for some reason, try update sound/graphdrivers.

But just for the record, the game sux.. :)"
,Pfc_biggins,2006-10-05T04:21Z,"I totally disagree with the comments about this being a poor game. 


This game is truly a freelancer at its best. The options they give you for how you play are nearly limitless. The new STORM engine used makes everything look incredibly. The detail that is placed in it really shows. Getting caught in a tropical storm (While causing some damage to your ship) looks absolutley amazing. 


Unlike many other caribbean style pirate games, Age of Pirates lets you become the ultimate terror of the caribbean. Through diplomacy, destruction, and trade you can set sail to make your fortune and increase your power. 


The charecter leveling set up in this game is very simiular to the Fallout games. There are a dozen different primary skills that can be increased. These include leadership, trading, smuggling, (Yes trading and smuggling are both different skills.) fencing, pistol, tactics, boarding, sailing, and many more. The hiring of personal officers will also increase these skills if you put them in the correct department aboard your ship. I.E. your navigator would go in the navigation spot aboard the vessel. 


As well as the primary skills you also develope traits, much like the traits from the fallout series. There are a few dozen traits that can be selected. Some that have draw backs as well as perks. (For example the beserker cannon ablility, while increasing to the load times of the cannons also increases the chances of an accidental explosion on deck.) 


Your officers are the back bone to your fleet. Each one is set up much like your own charecter. They will level up and increase there skills and traits. Each officer has there own inventory so you can aquire new equipment like swords and pistols and give them to your officers. You can hire as many as you like (If you can afford it.) They will also demand raises as they level up. A free officer is required in order to capture a ship or a town for your own personal use. Officers are also able to be placed on your flagship as specialists. Specialists increase your own skills. There are about a dozen different spots you can place them, such as surgeon, navigator, gunner, etc. Beware though, keeping a good eye on there loyalty is a must. A disloyal officer can be the loose end that starts a full out mutiny should conditions for your crew become less then desirable. 


You have the option of working for any of the four major political powers to increase your military rank while also working towards leveling up your charecter. The missions that the governors give you vary greatly. They include destroying trade ships, deliviring messages to spy's, eliminating or kidnapping high ranking officers, and capturing rival cities in your countrys name. The perks for this include the full support of your nation should you piss up the wrong tree. 


However if working for the gorvement is not your flavor, there is the option of becoming a master trader or (My favorite) a pirate that can truly choose to adventure in his or hers own personal style. 


The trade system in game is very elaborate. There are two different trade areas. Legit trade and Smuggling. Legit trade is a good way to start as you don't have to worry about pissing off the authorities. There is a huge selection of tradeable items and it requires keeping track of were certain items are produced and were the towns are that have limited access to certain items. The pay can be good if you invest in ships that have large holds such as the galleon. However the real money from tradeing comes in smuggling. Smuggling ilegal items for trade can be tricky but oh so rewarding. There is a large selection of ilegal goods available (Including slaves.) They can be purchased from other smugglers or stolen from the holds of other pirates through ship combat. Slaves are aquired through capturing any ship without killing the crew. (A large trade ship that surrenders without a fight can be a very vauluable prize. The best way to do this is by eliminating any escorts and using the chain shot to destroy its sails.)

,joeypesci,2006-10-08T16:43Z,"Yes it's English.  I think the crack makes it so or it is by default.  Just loaded it and it's English.  No speech so far, wonder if that's suppose to be like that.  Speech in the opening movie though and that's in English.

,Whoami1,2006-10-08T20:40Z,"I have the same problem with the non working crack for 1.41 like the many hire. Then I find the problem - the Star force. If you install it (i.e. after install the game click on exe icon and accept to install the Star force (like I did)) crack don?t work (even with patch 1.42). I did this because the crack doesn?t exist in game folder after installations. I find it later in rar file from which I install the game (for this who don?t now haw: just start the fail with double clicking and then it open the rar program and show the folders exist in the file, there is a crack folder, you need to dezarhiv it in game directory). 
When I reinstall the game, than copy the crack and all in these folder (without install the Star force) into game directory, game begin to work. Tray it, maybe it will help you.   
It work with 1.41, I didn?t tray with 1.42  
(Sorry for excellent English :)"
,joeypesci,2006-10-08T21:59Z,Apprently the crack doesn't work with 1.42 but then apprently that patch is really shit anyway and alot of buyers of the game have reverted back to old versions.
,joeypesci,2006-10-09T00:46Z,"Seems to be the English version yet I've had one pop up box appear it wierd text, which suggests its another language yet that language files are missing (not that I would of understood it anyway).

,XPsihoX,2006-10-09T10:41Z,"Is there a way to make the game run if u dont have the 1.42 patch, since i have a ATI 9200 Series and it constantly crashes the game after the intro, so there's no way i can run it in the 1.41 ver.

,stoopidboiy,2006-10-10T19:03Z,"i know alot of ppl are having alot of different problems with this game .. personally i think its not worth it to take the time to go thru all the dl'ing and cracking and patching im about to just go buy it.
however, im very broke. lol SO..
can anyone let me know if they've found a WORKING no cd patch for 1.42? if so pls email me @ sean1808@snet.net thank you much!"
,joeypesci,2006-10-11T03:24Z,"Don't EVEN THINK ABOUT BUYING IT!  The game is buggier than a big bug thing.  It's fucked.  It's enjoyable but save often as it randomly CTD with no error or warning.  Even people that have paid for the game get this.  And alot of people that paid for the game reverted from 1.42 back to the previous patches as 1.42 apprently makes it worse.

THIS game is the reason why people pirate.  Ironic considering it's name.  It's FUBARED!

If you save often it can be enjoyable.  But there are so many flaws and so many bugs, that the developers and publishers deserve to go out of business."

Now I get the same error as last time, but I don't remember what i did to resolve it.
In the \crack dir. there is a folder called ""program"", are we supposed to copy over the folder in one piece?"
,NoobAtDownloading,2009-01-03T19:32Z,I copied over the whole folder and it works now.

1 where is the crack cz all ihave is the rar files and 
2when i start the games it says cant find disk pls put the lisend disc in 
thank you"
,nightspydk,2009-02-03T13:09Z,"@hexplore15

If you through the description it included a step by step.

- Unrar the files with winrar (rarlab.com)
- You'll get an image file you need to mount with Daemon tools  (daemon-tools.cc)
- The crack you need to copy over is located on the mounted disk.

If that's not enough try post in games help on

I needed to copy-paste EVERYTHING from the /Crack directory that one finds in the Mounted Disc!!

...and not just the .exe


Now it works!

Thanks for the upload!!

I'm seeding... and I'm waiting for the next game of the series to be uploaded in .ISO file!!

Thx"

thx ;)"
,JSAknow,2010-02-15T05:09Z,"About the Engine.exe stuff..
I got the same error all the time, but then I had a look at the error description from windows, and noticed that it said ""Modname: ffdshow""

After that i had the idea that it was coos of an outdated version of ffdshow i had installed.

I went on the net and got the new 2010 ffdshow version and now the game works fully and fine :)

I hope this maybe can be some kind of help for others :)"
