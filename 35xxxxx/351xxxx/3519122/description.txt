+ RELEASE iNFORMATiON +
-----------------------
Wednesday 13, the former Murderdolls frontman whose campy reinvention of the
horror core genre has turned the most pre-eminent of shock rocker, Alice Cooper
into a fan, is set to release "Fang Bang," a 13-track album set for a Sept. 12
via Rykodisc.

Wednesday explains of the new release, "This is truly going to be the catchiest,
glam, punk, rock 'n' roll record that I have made in my entire history. The new
tracks are fast, fun, dumb and I'd say a little more reminiscent of my earlier
days with Frankenstein Drag Queens, but with a new twist. I'm really approaching
it with a 'less is best' attitude."
