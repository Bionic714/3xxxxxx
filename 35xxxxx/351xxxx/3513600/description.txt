Sadly, preview DVDs for this week's instalment of the thrilling recreation of Scott and Amundsen's race to the South Pole weren't available, but there's no reason to think that the pace and excitement will slacken. In fact, quite the opposite, things are cranking up now that the British team is facing potentially huge difficulties after earlier, unexpected events. And team leader Bruce Parry has to make tough decisions that will inevitably cause crushing disappointment to some of his colleagues. The journey concludes with two episodes next week.
