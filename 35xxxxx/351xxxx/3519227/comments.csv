,X_Virus,2008-02-24T17:17Z,Any way you could email me the sh2patch file by itself? My explorer freezes when I try to open the folder itself. my email is X_Virus333@yahoo.com
,Dr_Snugglebunny,2008-04-20T12:21Z,"Same problem as X_Virus; installed from ISOs OK up until trying to access the Crack folder, then had cyclic redundancy check errors and Explorer freezes. Gave up after 45min and bought a used copy...  

In future just put Cracks folder as a zip archive in the torrent? It's small enough and not needed on the CD version."
,powerthirst89,2008-11-04T02:53Z,"Down the torrent ""silent hill 2 pc 3 cd"", installing is much easier, and i have a walkthrough of how to install.  If you have any questions, post them on the other torrent page."
