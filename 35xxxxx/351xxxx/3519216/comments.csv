,white431,2009-01-02T15:42Z,"Well, I've watched the first 2.20hrs and I have to say I'm less than impressed. Some bad editing going on here, not seamless and jarring. Especially plonking the credits in half way through. The editing has done nothing for the pace, although it tried.

I concur above - WHY WMV?!??! Had to split this up and convert to DVD."
