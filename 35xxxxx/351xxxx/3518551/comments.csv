This is a different kind of ""game"" than what you usually play. It is a VISUAL NOVEL. Its a BOOK with music and visuals... NOT necessarily a game. Visual Novels have pretty much no gameplay so to speak - so if you are expecting an RPG from a VN, you'll be sorely dissapointed. I myself love visual novels and I reccommend this to anyone looking for another one to read. Also check out Divi-Dead and Fate/Stay Night. "
