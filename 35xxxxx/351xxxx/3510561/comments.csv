,BritneysOrifice,2006-08-09T00:50Z,"Anyone know what version this is? There's been a 1.03a floating around for ages (with keygen).  IGFly has a 1.06 out for about 6 months, but they don't make the trial for that version available at all.  Any chance this is the fabled 1.06 (or higher)?  Anyone know?  You can tell the version by simply running the install.. it will tell you in the install window."
,BritneysOrifice,2006-08-09T03:06Z,"For anyone else who's wondering:
Confirmed.  It's 1.03a.  If anyone has a 1.06+ version, please post it.  Even if you don't have a regkey for it.  Post it!!!!"

,[FSSR]HesAMental,2006-08-30T15:00Z,"Forget 1.06, it's bugged and bad. If anyone has 1.05 though, post it as reports suggest 1.05 is working OK."

,xxgunnerxx,2008-09-01T02:12Z,this program is crap. i have to use my keyboard for the movements. a freeware called f1 view from avsim.net is sooo much better. Just use the scroll wheel and you can rotate in all directions. Only downside is you can't save the viewpoints and you can't rotate like a clock's arrows.
,Tooumas,2009-12-20T19:45Z,"I have a problem. I open the trial setup and choose fs2004 folder, but I can't press install. :( It's disabled. Anyone else having this same problem? Any ideas?"
