	Skullview - Consequences Of Failure

Yesssss, this is true Metal for me! Rough, heroic without these easy-going choruses! Here epic, there fast, then doomy! SKULLVIEW are one of the few, who still manage to emanate the flair of the Eighties! It's obvious to me that only quite few people still are receptive to this kind of style! Their fault, shall they praise their gods - I praise mine!

The Epic Metal of the first two albums has been continued, but I think that this epos sounds more mature and rounder than ever before. The production, too, is the best so far. The vocals are brilliant, just imagine Bruce Dickinson screaming coupled with the roughness of a Tim Baker (CIRITH UNGOL). Vocals that 99% of all young Metalians won't even be able to stand for more than one minute! But you fools! If you think that SLIPKNOT or LIMP BIZKIT are Metal, then you are lost!

Ten songs can be found on this more than one hour long epos, among them a good rendition of BLACK SABBATH's "Digital Bitch". And with the song "Skullview (Warrior)" they have a hot contender for the award "Best song of the year". This track is absolutely divine! Incredible! And also the fastest SKULLVIEW-song so far, with a fat OMEN-touch!

As the rest also is more than convincing I just have to award them with 9 points! SKULLVIEW rule supreme! All hail to them![/quote] ripped from http://www.metal-observer.com/articles.php?lid=1&sid=1&id=3908

	Gods Of Fire - Wrath Of The Gods

I can?t help myself but wonder why some bands are still so fascinated with the 80?s. For sure, these years bring their bunch of influences, but still, as good as those years were, they are in the past for good now. Americans GODS OF FIRE brings us ?Wrath Of The Gods?, a true tribute to bands like IRON MAIDEN, JUDAS PRIEST and even JAG PANZER. Long songs await the listener, which will embark on a journey through different stories, narrated in mid-paced guitar oriented songs. In fact, not a single song is above 5 minutes of length, although it never gets dreary or dull. The band kept a high level of song writing, although the songs may sound straightforward sometimes, following a typical verse-verse-chorus-verse-verse-solo-chorus template. Lyrically, the band founds its inspiration in such stories as Dan Simmon?s ?Hyperion?, Stephen King and also some old poems.

 

As I said, the music is heavily guitar oriented. From slow paced riffs to speedy solos, intertwined with tasty dual guitar attacks, the already renowned gallop like IRON MAIDEN sound will make you head bang to death. My main complaint comes from the vocals. They are not bad in any way, it just feels like they are out of tune too often or that the singer doesn?t really know what to sing over the music, staying in a comfortable range, which makes the melodies sound flat. The overall sound of the band is not bad at all for an underground production, although the vocals would have benefited from a better treatment, as they often sound too monotonous.

 

I always like it when a band throws some surprises into their music, a little something that will change the pace of a song or will impress by its unpredictable character. Song 6, ?Eternally Strong?, is a perfect example, as it finds the band throwing some tasty Death vocals harmony over the clean lead vocals. It shows that music, even if it sounds like old songs of the past, can have a modern flavour, without sounding too far like the influences the band wants to transpire. It is just sad we had to wait for the 6th song to get to this point. I would have like to hear more of these kinds of elements in GODS OF FIRE?s music. It would have shown a desire to stay out of the bunch, while still playing the music they love.

 

Fans of modern bands that pay tribute to the masters will certainly appreciate the efforts of GODS OF FIRE. (Online April 8, 2005)[/quote] taken from http://www.metal-observer.com/articles.php?lid=1&sid=6&id=7770
