,Sieber,2006-08-13T20:44Z,Is the macbook Pro dual-layer ?
,Halcon,2006-08-13T20:52Z,You might try using the Restore function in Disk Utility and restore the image onto an iPod for example.
,bofors,2006-08-13T20:53Z,"1) This is the real deal, see Harieje's comments here: http://forum.insanelymac.com/index.php?showtopic=24308

2) The disk image expands to 5.05 GB.

3) This is a Univerisal Binary (UB), x86 and PPC.

4) This might not work on G3's.

5) On PPC Mac's is possible to install this without burning a disk by copying the image to a hard drive partition."

,icetoo,2006-08-17T19:41Z,"To get this to fit on one single DVD
download Carbon Copy Cloner,
create a new emtpy disc image (4.7 Gb) from disc utility.
Then use Carbon Copy Cloner to clone
from this Image (you must mount i first)
to your new created, but exclude Xcode Tools from this image by select it in Carbon Copy Cloner and then press the lite red buttom at top right. Then clone, you might get a error, but just click OK."
,miscaog,2006-08-19T04:08Z,"icetoo: I tried your method but it didn´t work, I even burned 2 DVDs and both got stuck when I rebooted to install.

I have a dual layer burner but no dual layer dvds :("
,markiv34,2006-08-19T10:53Z,"icetoo's method works just fine, I tried it myself and  you have to remove other files besides the Xcode folder, Desktop DB and also the hidden files.  Remember to burn the image using DiskUtility or else it wont boot."
,miscaog,2006-08-20T02:17Z,"Can you tell me exactly which files I have to remove other than Desktop DB & XCode Tools? How do I know which files are hidden?

Thanks."

,exG5,2006-08-21T00:35Z,Can we please get a reseed!
,exG5,2006-08-21T00:52Z,"I got a copy from another tracker, but it is exactly the same files.  I tried using Carbon Copy, but it only copied like 7 files.  I burnt the image anyways, and when I tried restarting it, it just hung after showing the grey apple.  Also, it made the fans on my dual 1.8 GHz G5 go crazy.  What gives?"
,jizac2,2006-08-25T20:05Z,"harietje thank you for sharing... 

To the real mofos, Yes this works.

and lol i've never read so many moronic idiotic questions and comments in my life. Y'all don't even have common sense or basic comuting skills.
Do your own legwork and some research before embarrassing yourself. 

Oh wait your hiding behind a pub serv."
,milodeescorpion19,2006-08-26T06:42Z,"here's a guide for installing it on ppc's and intels
without a DL DVD
Note: G3s are not supported by Leopard
Link:http://iamboredsowhat.blogspot.com/2006/08/mac-os-x-leopard-installing-guide.html"
,mpcwolf,2006-09-05T10:53Z,"Hey guys, can someone help me out with some installing probs?
I did everything in the guide etc. but when i start the installation, it restarts the pc, and when it reboots, all i see is a ""folder"" in the middle of the screen. inside the folder there is a blinking question mark which changes back into what i believe to be the os 9 logo, this goes back and forth and keeps going for about 15 seconds, after which the compuer returns to the regular os x boot, and so nothing happends.

I also tried to start up the comp while pressing the c key, but this didnt work either, it wouldnt boot from the disk. 

I burnt a double layer dvd for leopard with disk utility, and as far as i can see in the finer, the disk seems ok.

Any suggestions?

Thanks a lot for any help!

Cheers, "
