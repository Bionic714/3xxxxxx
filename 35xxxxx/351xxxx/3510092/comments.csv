,mrvain32,2009-07-29T08:44Z,Pls Seed this torrent I need at least 22 hrs to finish downloading. Pls seed. Anyone? Cos I maintain a ratio 1:1 for each download.
,musicvault,2009-08-07T21:07Z,"This torrent is my first experience with ""seed request"".Though I've downloaded more than 200 torrents.
From last 2 weeks I'm trying to download this. I've got 256kbps line.Somehow I reached 89.8%. All I need 2hr 30m of seeding after that I'm gonna seed it for others. There are atleast 7 in waiting.(4 in 89.7%,1 in 67% and remaining 2 below 20%) Pls understand. And Pls seed. My current share ratio @89.9% is 1.060 and still counting.
Pls seed, It would be greatly appreciated."
,musicvault,2009-08-08T18:03Z,Now....6 people @ 94.5% + me(94.6%). My current share ratio @ 94.6% is 1.309. Dude PLZ do seed atleast for 1 and half hr.
,musicvault,2009-08-10T08:47Z,"Man this is really funny...now 7 are @ 96.8% plus me at 96.8%. We are slower than snail's pace. Any good soul out there...pls seed for god's sake. Its making us nuts.
Cos when I'm done, I'm gonna be sharing this for atleast a week."
,thirteenburn,2009-08-26T10:20Z,"Just as I figured, this was nothing more than a vehicle for VH1 to milk and then shelve. Supposedly, both The Nuge and Bonham want to hold off on releasing any of the material ready for distribution, but no reason given. Supposedly it will interfere with tours or something, but I really think that it's VH1's call and they just wanted to run the show and be done with it.

I for one never had any hope that this would actually become a ""Supergroup"" as it had the VH1 ""reality show"" greasy little fingerprints all over it.

For those of you who are still waiting for this ""Supergroup"" to do something, stop waisting your time and move on. This is a dead issue and will never happen, was never going to happen."
,musicvault,2009-08-28T16:01Z,finally I did it. oh I  have 100%. I'm seeding for 4 more days. Peeps if anyone wants it pls drop a comment I'll reseed later too.
,The_Evil_138,2010-09-18T06:05Z,"I had all 7 eppisodes on my DVR for over a year but never got around to put them on my PC. Then yesterday I upgraded my DVR forgetting they were on there and lost them all. I'm so glad to see someone took the time to create this torrent. This is the best reality show ever, so big thanks to the uploader. "
