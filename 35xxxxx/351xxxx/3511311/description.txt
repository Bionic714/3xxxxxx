this is a trial to see how we are recieved
 
would love comments
 
little history on the song, originally written back in 2003 and played live, never recorded.

when I got to iraq I had all my equip sent out to me and recorded this between missions took about a month to finalize the vocals.  but the mix was completed in Iraq, the guitars were laid down by my buddy chris and the beats are me and my friend Mikey.  this has been our latest song ever since I have gotten home but more are in production.

So all the humor can you imagien recording this during a sand storm in a tent?  Oh and all my equip was sent otu to me through my other buddy mikey...so tell me what ya think I would enjoy hearing all comments
Thanks for supporting the locals
