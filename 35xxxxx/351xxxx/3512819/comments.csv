This was due to the DVD being made with the episodes in order of production, not in chronological order."
,CovertOPSDragunov,2009-08-22T07:28Z,Yah The DVD was made in Production Codes like freak and geeks instead of the episode numbers and freaks and geeks is excellent and watching episode 8 and downloading this haha everybodys probably watching this and freak and geeks because its on G4
