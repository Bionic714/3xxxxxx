,skoobydubie,2006-08-19T01:08Z,you really need to watch a rebuttal of this film. loose change is the loosest conspiracy theory ever made. an average ten year old can tell you what is wrong with their assumptions. get a course on critical thinking so that you can do what average ten year olds can do.

get a brain!"
,iamu,2006-08-19T16:55Z,Poorly made and hard to watch. No need to download this. Save your time downloading and you will have saved your time watching it. This is a feeble attempt to further the cause to misslead. The information given is not only thin but in many areas down right lies. What a waist of time.
,p2P2p,2006-08-19T17:24Z,"Hey there skoobydubie, can I ask... have you actually watched this re-cut version? It is brand new - in part forced by the threat of a lawsuit from the Naudet Brothers. The ""Final Cut"" is still likely to be bigger and better and with any luck in cinemas soon. This Docu looks at some of the facts and testimony not covered in other works. Still among the best films to get people to accept that the official versions of events fed to us by our government are a pack of lies. Please, I urge you to do your own research.

Look up some of these terms: Patsie/Asset, Controlled Demolition, Themate, Thermite, Cordite, Melting temperatue of steel, Combustion temperature of jet fuel, Firefighters and other eyewitness testimony, 25+ missing cameras footage of the Pentagon, Able Danger, Operation Northwoods, Echelon, Psy-ops... the list goes on...

Lastly..., but not least... WTC building 7.... http://67.15.129.139/6014/152/upload/p5124948.gif

""...doobie-doo... got some work to do now!"""
,p2P2p,2006-08-19T17:34Z,"...and @iamu - ""Poorly made and hard to watch"" - this couldn't be further from the truth - what ARE you talking about - just use the google video links above to start watching and make up your own minds.

And took a watch at a doc. called ""Screw Loose Change"" that tries to answer the questions that the guys in ""Loose Change"" asks.... but he can´t explain anything... just using his personal agony agains the one who did it and tries to take the focus from the real issues... 

That doc. is poorly done... but I still recommend ppl to see it and take a look the patetic tries to convince ppl to think it´s all a ""conspiracy theory"".... and yes for sure... it´s a conspiracy.... but when you got facts it´s not longer a theory.... It´s a ""conspiracy fact""

More ppl has to wake and stop listening to mainstream media... TV news is brainwashing ppl!!!"
