You prolly jumped on it too fast. Be patient config ur client correctly.

Upload rate, global max connects, whether you have DHT enabled or not, max half open connects, what the swarm avg is, all important factors determining what ur dl speed will be....

don't forget upload stream is directly related to your dl speed. Shoot I'm half done already while typing this muhahahah"
