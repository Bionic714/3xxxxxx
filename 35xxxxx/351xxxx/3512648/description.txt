
IF YOU'RE HAPPY IN AMERICA, DON'T READ THIS BOOK.


The fall from grace of the greatest power on earth since ancient Rome,
in sixteen chapters liberally foot-noted, end-noted, complete with appendices and bibliography.

This gut wrenching depiction of facts and observations, now told or soon to surface, will leave you saying: "I knew that", all the while wondering why the same view wasn't ever so clear before this. Not since Ayn Rand has such face slapping philosophy been exposed to the fresh air."There is no such entity as 'the public'. The public ismerely a collection of individuals.

The notion that the 'public interest' supersedes private interests and rights means: that the interests and rights of some individuals are less than the interests and rights of others, by fiat.

That person who places the interests of 'society' above his own rights as an individual has a very low self-esteem.

However, those wretches, whose societal reward comes from sharing in the forced redistribution and/or spoliationof other peoples? work product, have an even lower, depraved collective sense of self-esteem. This collective lack of self-esteem can only be assuaged by more spoliation."
