,flightcrazy,2007-07-13T23:04Z,"Thankyou 4X-AXG for this great upload, it is much appricated.

Readyed, instead of calling people who 'UPLOAD' and are willing to give their time up so us/we/the TPB flight sim community can have the best of the new releases that some of us can't afford.

4X-AXG has done a bloody lot for the TPB flight sim community and i'll be darned if i see a low level loner such as yourself act like that towards somebody who is willing to help others and who is willing to give their own time up to upload such great payware releases!

So next time you go to open your gob and are about to put something like that towards somebody who has given so much, THINK!

And think about yourself and if you were a person such as 4X-AXG who did so much for this bloody community, how would you feel?!

Or atleast start showing some bloody respect for those who deserve it!

Think i've already mentioned this, but thanks for the upload and look forward to future realeases.

,twan256,2007-12-30T08:49Z,thanks.. but for your information.. this is not a standalone SP.. you still need SP1 to correct the FDE problem
,airman123,2008-01-17T15:59Z,"If you have downloaded this torrent, then you have helped put PSS out of buissness. That means they will make no more addons. For proof, go to ""http://www.phoenix-simulation.co.uk"" and see for your self. I hope your happy!"
,Rayovak2.5,2008-05-27T18:23Z,then why are you here?
