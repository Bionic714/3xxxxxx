I obtained this torrent from another site which does not allow commenting. It contained no further information on its source. After downloading it, I can state that the quality at least appears to be from a DVD source. According to Window's properties, the encoding is XviD, 23 Frames/sec, 126-132kbps, Lame MP3, 640x480 resolution. I did not have time to load it into VDub to determine additional information, but that should be sufficient. Happy downloading.
