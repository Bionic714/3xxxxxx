,jen_eric999,2006-09-06T14:57Z,"Jinx, thanks for torrenting this. I was missing some episodes and this is better quality anyway. It was an outstanding show. I will be seeding."
,Jinx_Dojo,2006-09-09T01:50Z,"Thank you jen_eric999, I'm glad I could help and I appreciate you seeding. Unfortunately, due to constrictions of time and space (and the fact that for some reason my computer is now operating at dangerous temperatures), I will probably have to stop seeding in the near future. If I can fix these issues, I will try to seed again in the coming months.

Just so everyone knows, if seeds die on this torrent, you can feel free to private message me. I don't check it often, but I can try to help out if I see your message.

My request to anyone downloading this torrent is that they try to seed back 100% of the 6.49GB. It will help keep the torrent alive for all the fans of this great show."
,steadfaststylee,2006-10-03T21:00Z,"Thanks for providing this...I got re-hooked on this show lately as It's playing on a TV network called ""The N"" in the middle of the night...it's just too bad it isn't still on the air with new episodes."
,Jinx_Dojo,2007-02-16T16:43Z,"If I were to create a set of DVDs (that is, ready-to-burn ISO images) from this set, would anyone help me seed it? I know that discs 1, 2, and 5 exist elsewhere, but those of us who desire a complete DVD-playable set are left to either convert these or buy a DVD player that supports XviD. While I personally own such a player, the people for which I downloaded this do not. I have already converted the XviD to MPG2, so the question is whether I should take time to make menus, etc. or simply burn all 16.2GB of the MPG2 without menus. Perhaps I should simply seed those instead?"
,Jinx_Dojo,2007-06-06T17:25Z,"Is anyone still using ThePirateBay to find this torrent? I noticed an increase in traffic since I posted it here, but since this remains uncommented and ThePirateBay returns increasingly irrelevant results to search strings, I'm wondering if anyone even sees this anymore.

Anyway: I have realized that some of the audio is skewed on the video in these releases. It's possible that it's all the files, or just a few. Regardless, this has angered me: people need to learn to check, recheck, and if need be, re-rip. It's not that hard. I just can't stand improper releases. (Reminder: this is not my release--I simply forwarded the torrent file to this site.)

I have found a friend with an original retail DVD box set which I can borrow. The question is whether I should bother making a post here, especially if demand is down for this series. Let me know if anyone is interested. I'm considering ripping either DVD9->DVD9, DVD9->DVD5, and/or DVD-DivX/XviD, assuming I can get some quality software to do episodic discs with ease."
,digitalenemy,2007-07-23T11:30Z,"i would really appreciate that, jinx. you could do xvid/350mb for each episode, so you won't have to bother with dvd mastering. "
,joevollman,2007-10-22T05:33Z,i will be downloading this for sure! just gota clear some space to download the 6.49GIB! Can't wait this will hopefully be as good a gift to my sister(who was a big fan of the show) as it would be buying it for $60-$70 at the store on Oct. 30th! THANKS SO MUCH JINX!!
,joevollman,2007-10-23T14:33Z,1/3 of the way done! please please please keep seeding-thanks!
,lucyboo,2007-11-07T03:03Z,wil anyone be seeding this cuz I will be downloading as soon as Im done which would be like in 2 days I love this show and jordan was so cute 
,crazylamb1,2008-01-03T03:01Z,"i'd personally love to have the full dvd edition... there is that complete series with the book on amazon.. i live in bosnia and can't really buy it (no card for online shopping, and doubt they'd even ship here- and if they did, it'd cost a fortune)..anyhoo, it'd be awesome to have all 6 discs (there's a bonus disc with it on amazon i guess), and either .jpg scans or a pdf of the book.. 

in any regard, this is good, if the audio works (please let me know)? and are there english subtitles? some people i want to watch this with know english, but not well, so it'd be easier for them to at least be able to read what is being said..so please tell me about the audio and subtitles! :) thanks!"
,josefibbla,2008-03-12T19:01Z,"Oh, this is fantastic! Please seed :)"
,inticito,2008-03-26T01:46Z,"Jinx, muchas gracias, mi wife loved this show when she was a teenager growing up here in canada, and   Is this season 1? if you are thinking of posting the other dvds, i will seed to a ratio of 2. thanks again!"
,musemonster,2008-05-25T22:38Z,"oh man, i really hope this works because i'm KEEN! :) thank you!"
,sjkiss,2008-08-02T17:36Z,I'm really interested in getting the soundtrack for this show. Can anyone help out?
,2BRO2B,2008-10-24T21:13Z,"   I would be happy to seed the DVDs (no converion to anything) three times.  I am seeding twelve-thousand-megabyte files right now.  
   I love this show, too.  Claire Danes decided she did not want to be in any more shows--that sucks!!"
,2BRO2B,2008-10-24T23:05Z,"I cannot use these, they are AVIs.  Thank you anyway.  There were many seeds and peers for this, today.  "
,bad-and-ugly,2010-02-09T23:26Z,I'd totally download it if you posted it.  So the audio is a little skewed you say?
[T],Robston,2010-04-16T11:56Z,"Thanks. 
Currently 160 seeders, 230 peers. Downloaded this in just over an hour. Great job folks."
,thornybrown,2010-05-04T21:45Z,"Yes there are audio issues, and they vary from file to file. So it's not like one resync value works for all of them.

It's a pity as this is a great series. Jinx if you're still willing to borrow the box set and create fresh rips I can promise to seed for as long as is necessary."
[T],Robston,2010-05-11T17:25Z,"Can I recommend this from the BBC

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4767027/Drop_Dead_Gorgeous_Complete_Season_1___2_xvid_rip_(s1__amp__s2)_BBC

Excellent , but short show, much overlooked."
,Jinx_Dojo,2011-01-03T22:40Z,"I'm happy to see that this torrent is still so popular. I do sincerely apologize for the audio issues.

In regard to releasing the DVDs: I think I would definitely use DVDShrink, as there are 5 dual-layer discs in the original set. This would bring the size down to 21.85GB. I'd love to re-encode them to Xvid, but I don't think my computer is quite up to it.

I'm not sure if/when I'll get around to it, but please do keep a lookout here."
,bad-and-ugly,2011-01-14T16:52Z,"I hope you'll release it some day, Jinx.  I'll download it for sure '=)"
,samosa81,2011-03-15T20:26Z,"jinx - thankyou ever so much. i remember watching this when i was a teenager and i used to sit around with my girly friends and could completely relate to this program! havent seen it in years until just recenty i thought id look up a clip on youtube and see if it is there. and it was totally awesome, next step was piratebay and bam you have it here and its still going strong seed wise! thank you for the bottom of my heart, relive the heartache :)"
,9wires,2011-04-16T12:19Z,"you're a saint jinxy! i watched this show religiously when it was shown in the early 90s, and was completely bummed when it was cancelled!! so happy to find the one and only season on here and fall in love again with jordan catalano... "
,ingles666,2011-08-09T21:53Z,Thank you. In spite of the comments about the dodgy audio I'm going to give it a go. Nice work!
,kcdkeel,2011-12-22T00:54Z,"thanks for this, fast download, great quality, great show!"
