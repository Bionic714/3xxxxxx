now my stuff

anyone thats a fan of smallville or the shortlived series birds of prey will probably love this show.
the special effects are amazing and the story is so well developed and written it's so hard to believe that noone is going to pick this pilot up for a series. 
a great shame in my eyes
anyway the pilot is fantastic quality and i hope all of you enjoy it

,Asiablue,2006-09-02T20:52Z,How do I download this? I cant seem to get it to work.
,CraigH5477,2006-12-10T12:05Z,"methosivanhoe, I think I totally agree with u here my friend, this is a pretty good start to a TV series, just hope some network can pick it up & write some more Aquaman, plus they picked a good range of actors, didn't think I'd be seeing the likes of Ving Rhames on the small screen though, well least not for a little while anyway. However great work & hope to see some more of your torrents around the place"
,Niceonewill,2007-01-01T00:33Z,"Your right, this is a great Pilot. Too bad CW does not see the merit of this Pilot. Hopefully some other network will and cash in. If they do, I'll be a hooked fan...:)"
,rageofthemage,2008-01-29T14:53Z,"meh, a huge gigantic meh. aquaman is about as cool as the sub mariner...meaning he isn't."
,ArthurCurry,2008-01-29T18:49Z,"Does anyone know the name of the song at the end of the Pilot? When Orin is just standing there with the book in his hand?

,valerieG,2008-10-23T19:53Z,Thanks. This played fine in WMP.
,EeijiT,2008-12-13T04:43Z,This feels pretty weird when you have seen Smallville since the guy who plays aquaman here (Justin Hartley) is Green Arrow in Smallville. :P
,dustinbell84,2009-01-12T02:45Z,Thanks!
,IamAhab,2009-01-15T22:58Z,I thought Vincent Chase was Aquaman???

A - 9/10
V - 8/10

Everyone seems to talk about the pilot itself and not the quality of the video."
,spawn3731,2012-04-20T04:51Z,"Great shows/pilot. Too bad it didn't make it. A/V were as expected for a SD video. So like an 8 for both, audio was perfect for me, then I always use VLC and amp up the sound."
,jani372,2012-05-02T09:47Z,thx man
