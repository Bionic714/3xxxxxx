+ RELEASE iNFORMATiON +
-----------------------
Following the success of Only and Endless Road, Favored Nations Acoustic is
releasing two new projects from Tommy Emmanuel c.g.p. (certified guitar player):
a DVD entitled Live at Her Majesty's Theatre, Ballarat, Australia, followed by
the CD The Mystery.

A finger style guitarist inspired by the legendary Chet Atkins (who became one
of Emmanuel's biggest fans and gave him the title c.g.p.), he can simultaneously
play multiple parts, much like a pianist does with his left and right hands. But
his astounding technique isn't just for show; Emmanuel uses it to organically
blend folk, country, jazz, and other influences in his highly personal, emotive
compositions.
