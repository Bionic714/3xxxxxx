The Ship is a unique multiplayer PC game developed by Outerlight Ltd., created using Valve's Source engine. Set on a series of luxury, art deco cruise ships built by Mr X, this devilish game challenges you to kill or be killed.

Once you're on board you're given the name of another passenger whom you must find and secretly murder.Watch out for security unless you want to do some time in jail, take care of yourself and keep looking over your shoulder because somewhere out there is another hunter looking for you!
