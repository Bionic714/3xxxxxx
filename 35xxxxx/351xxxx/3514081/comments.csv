,Zenit33,2009-12-30T11:30Z,"Caution: Waste of time! Download something better.

This was a very average mod, eventually sold as a $20 boxed stand alone. But for online it uses Steam. If Steam wasn't annoying enough of course it makes it harder to play multiplayer with a downloaded copy, requiring programs which hack Steam or playing through VPN like Hamachi.cc

As for the game itself, it is a role-playing mod (if you have tried those), so the action is extremely poor and the idiotic jails (with sentences over 60 seconds) make an appearance. Few characters (though at least they are not randomly generated), even fewer enemies, weapons, (very limited ammo i.e. 2 bullets) and the rare firefights which you wait for are more clunky than Richochet, one of the earliest  mods for the first HalfLife which later came packed with it (costing an extra 8mb to install). 

A poor mod from 2006 is not a fun experience in 2009. Simplistic graphics, boring repetitive gameplay, and the maps (the whole draw of the game) are pathetic. Endless narrow corridors. 

The idea of this genre is solid, (surprise firefights in unusual situations with unusual weapons, resulting in great joy & intensity compared to almost every other FPS out there. But the execution (end result) stinks of amateurism. They failed the most on the movement of your character. How can a firefight be exciting when you walk at a snails pace through boring hallways with non-interactive environments?

If you want intense, atmospheric, (like Doom3 was supposed to be), go play Stalker.  If you want fast, crazy, endless, download TS (TheSpecialists) Matrix mod for CounterStrike 1.x

This was advertised like a Lucas Arts story game, but it plays like pure garbage, trust me. "
,aand,2010-07-20T01:28Z,Very nice gameplay in multilplayer. I'll upload an updated version.
