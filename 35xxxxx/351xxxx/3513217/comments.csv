,steinbrenner,2008-01-17T10:29Z,"Which one is it? The last one was Wing Commander 4, right?"
,Roland19303,2008-04-29T12:42Z,This is fake! Only 2.7mb!
,dredre27,2009-01-05T07:47Z,"Roland19303, this ISN'T fake. I just downloaded it and loaded it in dosbox. As the description says, this is an ""Old Skool Classic Space Shooter"". That is why it is so small. I bought this game back in the day when WC was new. The commercial version was distributed on just 3 or four floppy disks. Is definitely a very small game by today's standards."
