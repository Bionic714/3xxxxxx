,supernaut1330,2007-11-04T09:12Z,"Great post!  FYI - The quality 4 setting, is not a  quality setting.  It's the compression ratio.  A number 4 setting has the same quality as a number 8 setting.  The difference between the two, is the file size."

,jamieg420,2008-04-16T21:01Z,wtf? these files are formatted for VLC player and won't burn on a cd?????  wtf good is music you can't burn???
,Drumerguy12,2008-04-19T18:30Z,"@Jamieg420
These files are not ""formatted"" for anything but a FLAC decoder. Use Nero and burn a CD with them just like you would with MP3s. If it doesn't work, get a newer version of nero or download the nero mega plugin pack. Of course there are many other ways with many other programs. Try google. It's this cool website that searches the internet for you to find the information you need. A search such as ""burn FLAC to CD"" will work wonders."

,ChillyCrossFoot,2009-12-18T06:06Z,"No LOG
No CUE Files
If you are going to rip in FLAC, Please educate yourself on how to use EAC. I have just put up CORE, as that's the only CD I have, and I did it the right way. LOG, CUE, show some effort when ripping. Though most people won't care, some of us would like to have the original Pre-gap and indexing on the original CDs. 
Last but not least, thanks for the effort. "
