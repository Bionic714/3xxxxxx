If you're posting something which requires downloading a *License* then it's SPAM.

Free, or not, downloading any video which requires a license is a dangerous thing in the file sharing community. http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/01/13/drm_trojan/

Just say ""NO"" to licensed torrents!"
,dalecooper99,2006-08-16T05:46Z,fuck off
,uraphake,2006-08-16T08:33Z,"I suppose the I could have said the same thing, but it wouldn't be polite and help people understand just why licensed bullshit is just that -- bullshit. But it's free, so it must be good, right?
Something that is ""free"" yet has a string attached to it is perfectly harmless, right? Yet...what purpose does the string serve?"
,Honken101,2006-08-16T12:30Z,"Something that is ""free"" but still has strings attached to it isn't free. FREE is when there are no strings attached!"
,docker,2006-08-16T23:12Z,fuck that
