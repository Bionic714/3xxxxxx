,Tcip,2006-08-23T17:23Z,"Hello? Why downloading this, 251mb big program when it's 26mb ?"
,urbanriot,2006-08-25T06:54Z,"It's not 26mb, nor is it 251mb. The full release should be in the 400mb range. 

This version is already dated and has security flaws. Look for the 10.1 torrent. "
,Tcip,2006-08-26T10:05Z,"urbanriot - Why 400?! what's included in that one, thats doen't exist in my 26mb ?"
,r4v3n,2006-09-08T01:11Z,10.1.4.4000 exists with a free update to 10.1.4.4010...
,enlightend,2008-03-27T15:24Z,"Symantec Corp is a server/client system with client versions for nearly every OS ranging back to Windows 95.
It also includes an app for centralized management, an app for centralized quarentine, client creators, centralized update system, centralized reporting and notification to email/cell/..., etc, etc.

The 20 something meg file you were using was nothing but one of the client versions.

Now you know why its supposed to be a whole lot more then 26MB."
