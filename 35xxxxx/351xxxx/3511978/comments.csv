However, I juz posted a crack that finally work..check out FL Studio Registration Revived..and download it

,demoguy,2006-11-03T00:09Z,"great, thanks for this. one thing though, i deleted the annoying html file that pops up when i start FL, and now it's gone, it's just that now i get an error message saying ""couldn't find bla bla file.html"" (FL still works)

anyone know how to get rid of it?"
,emceeshroom,2006-11-14T12:52Z,So i Dl'd the torrent and it says that windows cannot open the file because windows doesnt know what file created it. What can I do? I use FL everyday and this is drivin me nutty. thanks
,pythonusr,2007-01-30T23:44Z,"Guys, you can't just patch the FL.exe file. You need the registry entry and the dll as well. I have a torrent up now that includes everything with instructions, but without the extra files you aren't going to be able to save files bigger than 0 bytes."
