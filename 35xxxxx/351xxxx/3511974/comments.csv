'1. Plug your USB Flash Drive into your Xbox 360 and go to System Settings -> Memory -> USB Stick -> Configure Now

2. After the usb is configured to be an xbox hard drive, go to Hard Drive -> Themes, and copy or move one of your themes onto your usb stick.

3. Now plug your usb stick into your computer and open USB Reader. Click on File -> Open Device -> Content -> 000000000000 -> FFFE07D1 -> 0030000 (themes)

4. Unzip the contents. Copy all of the themes into your themes folder (00030000) in the USB Reader program

5. Exit USB Reader and unplug your usb stick. Plug it into your xbox 360. Move all of your recently downloaded themes onto your Xbox Hard Drive (it is easier to use the Transfer Content feature, by pressing Y while the Memory Stick is open).

6. Enjoy these custom themes :)'"
