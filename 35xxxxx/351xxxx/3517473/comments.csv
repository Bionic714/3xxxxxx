,Roblee,2006-09-02T02:23Z,"fsn sucks! it was better earlier.. you can see it is american tv, commercials all the time! i hope it isn't fsn every time.. then i rather see ufc!"
,padre_,2006-09-04T20:03Z,"Thanks for the rip, Noisemaker. I'll take it and load the rest of the matches (most of them) from the Korean version. They didn't show every match even earlier in the ppv shows, but now they have managed to ruin the show totally. Producers should be put in the ring with Fedor."
