,Tcip,2006-08-09T14:41Z,"ZENDO - If you read the changes you can see that the have change the settings. And is it to hard to click and see if you can find it, or search for it? Keymap is in folder: UserData. And: xboxmediacenter.xml dosen't exist more. The data in that file is in: sources.xml (the network settings is here). RssFeeds.xml gueest .."
,ZENDO,2006-08-09T16:02Z,"ffs what a crap. 

I just want to start my xbox with XBMC. Why the whole new setup.

changing the default.xbe to evoXdash.xbe on the c:/ drive wont work!

And where is under programs the submenus emulators and programs? "

The XBE shortcut maker gives an error on this pc if i want to start it.

thx."
,Tcip,2006-08-10T11:44Z,Google?
,ZENDO,2006-08-10T12:04Z,"tcip, if you dont want to do it fine!

looking on google for exact that shortcut .xbe is useless. i think you have a problem with reading. I have the program to make shortcuts, but it gives an error! 
"
,ZENDO,2006-08-10T12:20Z,"always great builds! But this one really sucks! 

- It doenst regornize my old scanned info from my cd's so all the covers are gove. 

- clicking on programs, he has to load it every time. And why are the buttons on the left gone with emulators and programs?

- playing a videoclip in the front screen, why stays the useless info on the right there?

And many more......
