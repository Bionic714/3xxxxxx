,jester45,2007-02-10T04:19Z,"i didnt add a crack on cd just use d-tools or burn to a cd you can find cracks online

also just a tip if you want to get it to start faster delete the folder C:/Program Files/Microsoft Games/Freelancer/Data/Movies

it should have 3-4 movies those are the ones at the beginning so you can delete those"

Don't try to run it from a folder, burn it to a CD and then run it from there."
,jester45,2007-07-02T22:55Z,i dont suggest the void server for beginners. at least beat the single player missions first. the Voidmod is a great mod though. and you can use d-tools in replace of a noisey/slow cd

,jester45,2007-12-31T07:47Z,"nothing needs to be done it works fine when you first try to connect it makes a key that kinda acts like an account name meaning you can write this down and put it on any other comp and play with your chips there. once your accept the key you get a list of servers join one and you can play.

i dont know how or if it possible to change the key without reisntalling"

,E419,2008-08-30T16:15Z,"IF you want to play online and it wont work try this workaround for the global servers 

http://www.moddb.com/games/freelancer/downloads/freelancer-global-server-workaround "
,Thief()Lord,2008-12-03T00:56Z,"The Microsoft global server went off line some time ago. If you need to get connected then here is how to do it in a few different ways.

1. Use an installer that will do it all for you. Freelancer List Server Patch

2.Use a mod that works with Freelancer Mod manager. Freelancer List Server Patch as flmod file

3. Do it manualy

You just need to modify your freelancer.ini in your EXE folder.

You?ll find the following line:
hostname = fllistserver.zone.msn.com ; GUN server in Redmond (DNS entry)

Replace that line with the following lines:
;hostname = fllistserver.zone.msn.com ; GUN server in Redmond (DNS entry)
hostname = gun.fllistserver.com ; http://www.fllistserver.com"

,NeKo-ArroW,2009-06-11T15:45Z,"I just thought I should inform the fans of freelancer that even tho the global server is offline, there are still a few servers out there that's fully playable.

one of them is Freelancer Universe, barely modded and the mod is optional (but it might be a bit unstable without it) and it's fairly easy to join, simply open ""fldirectip.hta"" in the \freelancer\exe\ folder and enter:
IP: 98.223.122.33
Port: 2302


If you're running VISTA i recommend you visit www.Freelancer-Universe.com and go to ""Technical issues"", there's a topic there explaning how to fix all problems with VISTA."
