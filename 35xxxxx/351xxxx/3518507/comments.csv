,Goodsword,2007-01-23T01:08Z,please seed.
,TLyn589,2007-04-22T16:33Z,How do you load this file? It is .mdf and not an iso file. I have alcohol 120 but when I try to mount it the file doesn't even show up!
,Nuvax,2007-11-15T08:10Z,Mount the .MDF using daemon tools.
,bungiefan,2008-03-06T01:59Z,Does this version work for Mac OS X?

,OrpheusXY,2008-06-09T18:52Z,I mounted the file on daemon tools but when I try to run it I get a ''An unsupported operation message''. Any clues on what I'm doing wrong?
,lysje,2008-11-09T14:27Z,"Me too, when I try to mount it with Deamon tools lite, I got the ""an unsupported operation was attempter"" (autorun)... 
Does anyone know what I could do?

ps. I played creatures 2 and looooved the game! I really hope to be able to try this Creatures 3!"
,etiienne14,2008-12-30T23:45Z,"Hi!
It's the first torrent that I downloaded and I would like to know how to install it on my PC!
Thank you!"
,Juiicyjet,2009-01-31T15:05Z,"I have the same problems as OrpheusXY and
lysje. Can someone tell us what we did wrong? I really want to play the game!! :D "
,orcywoo6,2009-03-08T23:14Z,I will seed this amazing game once it downloads :)
,downloadadmin8,2009-04-05T07:33Z,Never played Creatures 3 but loved creatures 1 back in tha day ;)
,crisdine,2009-04-10T06:50Z,"no instructions?xD
i managed to open the mdf file
but when i run the Setup.exe but then
it kept looking for a file.
Error 105
looking for Setup.Lid file."
,weavermage,2009-06-24T13:31Z,"omg. Do not download this. Go find it somewhere else to download this. OP made this the most infuriating piece of shit to download.

Daemon, ISOpen and all manner of programs won't do shit with it. Right now I am extracting it to my personal hardrive to see if that works.

I joined just to inform you all, download it somewhere else! Not worth the wait/frustration/struggle"
,SittingKarcass,2009-07-20T18:35Z,Does anyone have a clue how to mount this file? .mdf files do not even show up in the mount browser. From what i've read some of you seem to have at least mounted the file. Care to lend a hand or will you simple ignore other pleads for help?
,SittingKarcass,2009-07-20T18:55Z,"OK, you have to convert the .mdf toi an iso. You cam do this using the freeware version of magic iso."
,MacGregor91,2009-08-05T01:27Z,"From gamespot forums: ""You can run Creatures on Vista. Go to My Computer or whatever its called. Then right click on Creatures 3 and go to Explore. Then click on the Install folder. You go through a few more folders and you should find a Setup icon. Right click on it then go to Properties. Go to Compatiblility at the top. Click the box to run the compatibility mode and set the mode to Windows 2000 for the best results. Apply the changes then exit out. Then double-click on the Setup icon. You might have to right click again and go to Run as Administrator. This will install the program on your computer. You'll have to go to the Start menu with the disc in to play. Vista doesn't recognize the startup engine to Creatures for some reason so every time you want to play, put the disc in, wait for the message telling you that the engine won't work, click out of the message, go to the Start menu and start your game up from the Start menu.""

It worked for me (tried it with Creatures 3 and Vista and Daemontools) "
,bisous91,2011-08-09T00:47Z,"Worked fine for me.
I renamed the file from .mdf to .mds"
,BlackEthelRackham,2011-10-05T03:58Z,Just downloaded and installed this. Very good torrent. I just mounted the .mdf file with a pro version of magicdisc which you can get right here at good ol' tpb. Thank you LeLoomer 
,Frogstar1988,2012-08-19T05:59Z,yeah it defenetly doesn't work with Daemon tools lite and renaming it didn't do it ether 
,Frogstar1988,2012-08-19T06:20Z,"SittingKarcass  

Thank you verry much you're way works perfectly fine Thanks again and thank you LeLoomer for upload. but next time please a Description on how to use/install something that helps all of us."
