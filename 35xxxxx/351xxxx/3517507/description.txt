A broad overview of the two-decade career of David Lanz, Romantic collects music from his numerous studio albums plus four collaborative tracks and three compilation-only cuts. The pianist's works tend to fall into two categories: contemplative contemporary instrumental and classically influenced compositions. The latter is where he shines, as represented best by the sentimental stylings of "Cristofori's Dream" and "Return to the Heart," and the effervescent energy of "Vesuvius" and "Valencia." Most of these 27 tracks are solo piano performances. However, the soaring "Eagle's Path" (with Paul Speer) integrates rock guitar, and a few other pieces include orchestral instruments. This isn't a "best of" compilation, but the double-disc compendium is a good way for longtime fans to get lesser-known tracks and sample albums they are unfamiliar with. More important, it's a means for the uninitiated to learn about, and then seek out, other Lanz music of their choosing
