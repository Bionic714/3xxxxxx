,rought69rought,2006-09-10T02:38Z,works great man... get magic ISO and then convert to an iso...then go to tools/burn cd/dvd with iso and make a disk...install using the new disk..works like a charm
[T],ulysses56,2006-09-10T21:14Z,"To be honest, Im so tired of making copies of this wonderful series I have on my office. Its work perfect with my laptop but when I started to copy the discs I had a really tough time. Some disc is with ?copy security? and make the whole thing so difficult. If I knew that in the beginning I would never make all this effort. 

But I know it will work in the end for all of you, just try and try like I did. I?m not very technical. 

Take care everybody.

,mazdon,2006-09-17T18:02Z,"What a sad story.... hmmm
I can get some of these torrent to work... with a lot of trouble.... burning CD:s that doesent work, loading down diffrent programs that doesenÂ´t work to crack this torrent...so sad, I really looked forward to get this torrents as I have a lot of friends that are nurses or working in that area.
But I can see that it will be far to complicated for them to manage this downloads.... so sad.... ;(

Anyway ulysses56, thanks for trying...best regards Maxthegun"

,haroo,2007-05-20T12:53Z,"I too was having lots of trouble getting these programs to work, but i think i have found the solution.

For some reason, using daemon tools 4.08 only allowed me to run discs 2,3,4,5,8 and 9, but by installing the older version daemon tools 3.47 (this is available from the website), i was able to get the whole series working by mounting the .img/.iso file with safedisc emulation (missing files torrent is not neccessary). Hope this helps others having trouble.

also to those who dontt like the files taking up their hard drive (neither do i) just burn all the files onto one disc using nero express (so that the .iso/.img files remain as .iso/.img files) and run the programs through daemon tools directly off the disc. abit slower but saves space:)

A huge thanks to ulysses56 for these! I highly recommend these programs, they have helped me hugely with my studies as a med student"
