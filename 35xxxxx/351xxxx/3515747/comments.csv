,panther68,2006-09-09T02:35Z,yes make sense dude
,swechetter,2006-12-27T10:15Z,"this is a .jar file and it will probably work on the most common SE mobiles.

if you have an USB cable to the mobile, sync your mobile with the computer.
then you acess its memorycard through windows explorer, go to the folder ""others"". (main menu/file manager/others)
put the .jar file there.

ok now youre done, pull your USB out of the computer.
ok, now you go to your mobile, go to the ""others"" folder where you put the .jar file, install it and play :D"
