,geckoone,2006-08-10T16:24Z,"Nevermind, this one is working now."
,philip_bennefall,2006-08-13T01:43Z,"Wow, this is amazing. I love those episodes! I've heard a couple of dramas that I downloaded from other places, and although the audio quality is horrible they're still great to listen to. Keep it up and I'll be sure to seed!

By the way, the download rate isn't too bad. 16 kbps is perfectly okay, I start sighing when it goes down to 800 bytes."
,philip_bennefall,2006-08-13T01:55Z,"Right, things are speeding up. About 80 kbps now. Whatever you do, please don't stop seeding! Thumbs up for this one."
