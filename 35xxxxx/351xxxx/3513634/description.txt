I have always loved music of Capercaillie mostly because of gentle but also powerful voice of their singer Karen Matheson. 
"The Dreamins Sea" is her debut solo release, quite influenced by Capercaillie's style, but providing more opportunities to Karen to express her jazz feelings together with traditional Celtic instruments. 
I can listen to it again and again and I always like the music. It is warm, soft an fair - if you like Capercaillie, this is also a must-have for you.
