Plot

"It's a new night for terror...and a new dawn in
horror movie-making when special effects genius
Tom Savini brings modern technology to this colourful
remake of George A. Romero's 1968 cult classic.

Seven strangers are trapped in an isolated farmhouse
while cannibalistic zombies wage a relentless attack
killing everyone in their path. The classic for the 
'90s: graphic, gruesome and more terrifying than ever!"

Ripper's Notes:

Accordning to IMDB this movie is 88 minutes (not the
uncut version which is 92 min), but the one on this dvd
only 85 minutes? This is from the UK release, is it
more cut? Well, enjoy anyway, it's a great zombie flick
however :)
