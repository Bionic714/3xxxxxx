Don't download it, even out of curiousity (no, I haven't sone so - and nor will I). It could set you on a seriously fucked-up path that you really, really don't want to travel."
,86pOkLmN,2007-11-03T23:10Z,"My word, how happy people are to condemn that which they do not understand. This movie is not porn and even describing it as bestiality is a little misleading. I saw this film when it was shown in the London Film Festival in 1975. It is an art movie in the spirit of Un Chien Andalou or C'est arrivĂŠ prĂ¨s de chez vous (Man Bites Dog), another Belgian movie that scandalised people. Having said that I am not going to download it and watch it again beacause it is difficult to watch and quite unpleasant in parts, although the sequences where he tries to raise the piglets as his own children are quite funny. Of course, this humour is just there to relax the viewer for the final horrifying twist. "
