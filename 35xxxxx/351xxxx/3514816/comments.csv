[T],sotis,2006-08-23T18:20Z,"@ WrightOne1111: Make sure you go into the reservoir dogs folder and click on the crack (resdogs.exe) that you copied to the folder. The original shortcut links to the original exe (reservoir dogs.exe) and will not work. I´m not sure this is your problem, but it´s all I can think of."

[T],sotis,2006-08-24T18:53Z,"@ pcgamers: Have you even tried to download this torrent? If you don´t get any seeders you must have some problem with your router and/or firewall.
By the way, next time you make a comment, why not try to be a little nicer?"

,Vapez,2006-09-08T17:19Z,"If you experience lagging, try to finish the mission and restart the game after that. The lag will be gone the next mission but it comes back after 2 or 3 missions so you have to do it over again. It's a great game but it's realy short."

,tonyboner,2006-09-11T19:02Z,"Great torrent.  Everything worked flawlessly.

Games like these are what torrents are all about, too.  It took about six hours to finish and there's very little replay value.  I would've been pissed had I spent more than twelve bucks on this...

Thanks again, Reloaded."

,jomos352,2006-09-19T14:39Z,could anyone please teach me how to set the video resolution in the game? i want to reduce the in-game resolution.
,maran123,2006-09-20T20:13Z,i read about a sort of unortodox solution... remove eax.dll from the game folder.. it stops the lag but the sound gets wierd from time to time and after 30min gametime my computer shut down...
,maran123,2006-09-20T20:59Z,"update:: if you reduce your sound hardwareacceleration while eax.dll is not in its directory game works like klockwork.. here is the guide for how to do it

1)	Enter the Control Panel from the desktop by clicking on the Start button, followed by Settings, and then Control Panel.
2)	Double-click the icon labelled System, usually located alphabetically towards the bottom of the Control Panel window, to bring up the System Properties panel.
3)	Click on the tab at the top labelled Device Manager and when the new panel appears, locate the section labelled DVD-ROM and click the Plus (+) sign in front of it. (If there is a minus sign in front, don't click it.) 
4)	Now double-click the DVD-ROM drive revealed and the DVD-ROM Properties panel will appear.
5)	Click on the Settings tab at the top. 
6)	Towards the middle of the panel, you should see a few checkboxes within the Options section. At the bottom of that section, you should see a checkbox labelled Auto insert notification. 
7)	Make sure there is a check mark in the box provided and click on the OK button to complete the process.

Just run the exe and extract to a new folder on your desktop. Once thats done run the setup.exe file in the folder that it extracted to and that should fix your problem."
