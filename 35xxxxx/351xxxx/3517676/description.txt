Discovery Channel - "Patent Bending".

The Patent Bending team scours books of patents from the past 100 years to find the seemingly greatest, strangest or most fantastically odd ideas that never got off the page - then figures out why.

Each episode identifies one idea and starts the process of bringing the invention to life. They build it, test it and they quickly figure out why it never worked. 

Season 1, Episode 2:

"Floating Tent"
With lakefront property harder and harder to find for campers, the idea of a floating tent seems to makes sense. The concept of camping by the lake is taken to new levels as the team expands on the ?Floating Tent? invention. The team takes the idea to the next level and sets sail with their version and goes camping on the lake.
