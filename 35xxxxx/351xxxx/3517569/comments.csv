,Dash101,2006-09-02T15:59Z,"Eize, your an ass.. WHY would you upload this to this site and then quit at 96.8%? ??   FINISH THE JOB YOU ASS! "
,Temptation,2006-09-05T08:13Z,"thanks for this documentary.  Ignore the rude assholes.. the stats seem to show completions, so it sounds like you did indeed seed.

Dash101,

I can't speak for the uploader, but he/she probably did that to prevent leecher scum from not giving any bandwidth as soon they completed the download.  By stopping at 98%, he forces people to upload to other leechers... after which he can jump in again and allow people to complete without wasting too much bandwidth because of leecher scum who would have stopped seeding and forced the uploader to give a lot of bandwidth.
