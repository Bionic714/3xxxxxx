,marionappo,2006-08-17T02:21Z,I really wish some one could seed this movie with swedish subtitles.
,marionappo,2006-08-17T02:23Z,And that the movie could fit on a ordinary DVDr
,ramday,2006-08-17T06:20Z,Anything ripped or compressed? NTSC?
,sparcane,2006-08-17T08:21Z,"NTSC, as the title says. I can't find the nfo so I'm not sure about the compression, but the only extra is the trailer, which is still there."
,Mattias1977,2006-08-17T11:14Z,"what about the audio. according to the cover there's English 5.1 DD and DTS and spanish 2.0

Can you inform us about this?

I can't play DTS so I need to know if any of the audio is ripped out and if so which part. If all audio is kept the bitrate will be quite low"
,marionappo,2006-08-17T11:24Z,"There is a dvd with swe sub but its on 6,*Gig. For Dual layer."
