they\\\'re dub, they\\\'re reggae, but they\\\'re also much more than that. the trinity roots sound encompasses wellington\\\'s unique jazz, funk and soul traditions as well. with their live shows they create a real and honest connection with their audience, being natural performers who captivate with their skanking grooves, fantastic musicianship and heartfelt subject matter.

formed in 1998, trinity roots are lead singer warren maxwell on guitar, rio hemopo (baritone) on five string bass and riki gooch (falsetto) on drums and assorted items.
