In Introversion's second sci-fi computer-themed game, you once again find
yourself as a hacker. Unlike Uplink, however, Darwinia focuses on the
world inside the computer rather than our own.

Cruising around the net, you stumble into a mysterious computer network
called Darwinia, the brainchild of the barely sane genius Dr. Sepulveda.
Darwinia is what amounts to a Jurassic Park for programs; small sprites
called Darwinians evolve and adapt to their digital environment as its
maintainers watch. But despite the fact that you're not supposed to be
in the system, Dr. Sepulveda has no choice but to enlist your help. A
deadly virus has taken over the system, and in order to save not only
billions of dollars of research but also the simulated lives of the
Darwinians, you will need to take command of the computer.

Played inside a fractal-generated world inspired by retro arcade games
as well as films like Tron, Darwinia requires you to take strategic
command of various program-generated units to protect the Darwinians
as well as engage in fast and furious action combating the virus with
soldiers.
