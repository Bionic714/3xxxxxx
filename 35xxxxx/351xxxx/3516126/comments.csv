,UnforgivenII,2007-07-09T15:40Z,"GUITAR RIG 2
-----------------

And where are you supposed to connect your guitar, when you don't have the actually rig to the program? The rig looks like a effect pedal, that you connect with USB into the cpu. But without it, I'm not sure it'll work.

Does someone know if it works without it? Where I should connect my guitar and stuff?"
,Smappa2,2007-07-22T09:55Z,"In guitar rig 2, connect your guitar to line-in plug. You will need an adapter to do that, it costs about 2?. Adapter will change 6.3mm jack to 3.5mm so you can plug it to your PC."

 It's easy, Just copy the very long serial number that is on the right hand side of the Cubase regestration box, and paste it onto the keygen.

What up with this nbst11kg.exe?  Can someone tell me how they are allowing this on their system?   I don't want to let it through unless I have more info.  W'ere you guys able to completely clean this and fully test your systems for infiltration?   Takes maybe thirty hours of install and set up to get a music computer working, and to trash it for just one lousy ""trojan""?  Thanks for any suggestioins."
,Jorobon,2008-06-11T02:14Z,"jesussaddle - did you check this out?
nbst11kg.exe, is executable for Novation.Bass-Station.VSTi.v1.10-H2O.  Look for the file on the net, including Symantec and McAfee, and see what you come up with. Downloaded, checked and rechecked, file was clean. Ran it on 3 systems; Win2K, XP SP4 & Vista, they all ran well using the suggestions on Vista.  I understand being paranoid, I've lost much data to bugs, but this torrent has been running for almost 2 years and you are the only one talking about a bug. . .
