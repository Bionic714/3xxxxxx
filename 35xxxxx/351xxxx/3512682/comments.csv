,anvil_,2006-08-16T13:54Z,"ok, dont go through any trouble :) just thought if you had them on your harddrive"
,andbir,2006-08-17T12:30Z,"well as of this moment i have 85% of episodes 3-10 down and running, and ~20% of episodes 11-22 which i am downloading at a lower priority so i guess 3-10 should be here by tomorrow friday at the latest"
