Note:  We consider ourselves at MP3 to be ahead of
the game when it comes to audio quality.  We prefer
to rip to LAME 3.97b because it yields better sound
quality at a more efficient bitrate.  However, the
scene is not yet prepared for 3.97b, as pzs-ng/glftpd
have not yet been updated to detect the presets in
this new encoder.  In addition to this, some groups
have been taking advantage of using new LAME versions
or presets and have been sound shaping and altering
bitrates to make re-encoded webrips appear as legit
releases.  As such, we have decided to revert to an
outdated version of LAME until the scene is prepared
for an update.
