But what is listed is a good start...and appreciated that you would take the time to post it!"

,sanaa17,2010-02-27T03:48Z,"What a bunch of assholes! You should be happy that this shit is free, and that someone took the time to upload all this. Especially Laxana, put your money where your ass is, and upload that missing discography, if you even have it. Otherwise, keep your trap shut and appreciate the freeness... "
,bendoveru,2010-03-11T06:46Z,"From what i gather this torrent's songs aren't tagged?  I think i will just pass on this one, but much thanks to the up-loader!  Seriously how is anyone going to complain about free shit..."
,theskinner,2010-05-21T06:40Z,This is awesome... Am searching for the flac/Lossless version..anybody ?
,Akronias,2010-06-27T10:54Z,"You have made my week, I can not thank you enough."
,5yuma5,2010-07-27T01:03Z,"You missed a song or two here and there and their self titled album Duran Duran is not the original it is the re-release in the US which was not done in 1981. 

Really good torrent though just needs some modifications."
