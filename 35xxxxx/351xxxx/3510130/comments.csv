,200regal,2008-12-09T11:56Z,"seriously i want to see this so bad!
i mounted with daemon tools and just the video and audio files comes up
and i tried to burn it with dvd flick but it cant burn it for some reason 
what do i do to play this?!?!?!"
,erox,2009-06-23T08:49Z,"This is a Nero image file, like ISO but made by Nero.
Apart from the different file type, it is practically the same.
It burns with Nero and a few other burning apps.
It mounts with most apps, D-Tools, MagicDisc, WinMount, Virtual CloneDrive...
Once mounted/burned, it plays like it is. A DVD."
