As I said it before, you have no idea how thankfull I am for all the Amy videos you post! Thank you for making it possible for me to watch! 

And these last two are HQ ones! That's awesome!
I wish I was there in the show! Amy was great and the sky looked really beautiful. Plus, I loved the introduction/chorus that she sang without the band!

Thanks again!"
