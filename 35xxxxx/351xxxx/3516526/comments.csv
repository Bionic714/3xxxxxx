I write this for all the fans in the netherlands and everywhere in the world. We need all go go to this site: http://www.savestargatesg1.com/ 

why? Sci-fi has cancelled the show!!! 


As the 200th episode of Stargate SG-1 aired, the SciFi Channel cancelled the show. Season 10 will be the last unless we as fans rally to support Stargate SG-1 and MGM, the studio producing the show. MGM are actively seeking other options for Stargate SG-1, but they need ratings to remain strong with as many people as possible watching live on Friday nights. It's also vital for the Stargate SG-1 fanbase to show concrete, quantifiable support by writing letters and postcards, making calls and faxes, and in downloading episodes of the show from iTunes. 


Please fans, Wherever you are, help stargate survive! ""...they were NOT PREPARED for the speed or the strength of international fan protest against their abrupt cancellation of Stargate SG-1..."" so we still have s shot at this. 

Jera7, the Dutch guy.
