Well where to start with this one!?!


This is the famous Effin Eddie GAA Video encoded for the first time and uploaded I believe.

This is an Amateur Gaelic Football Video of a match between Aherlow and Nenagh in County Tipperary in Ireland in 1992.

The video of the actual match is not the highlight of this but the commentary by Eddie Moroney is one of the most hilarious things ever(Only if you are Irish maybe?).

Some Highlights include:

"What a relief, he's like a tablet".

"Bollox of a ref".

"You can't be boxing Tyson!".

"It's going to be a big night in the Glen".

"I think I'm gonna get sick!!!".


There are many more gems to be found within and at the end we get the interviews with the coaching staff, players and locals!

All up this accounts for one great laugh!!!!

The video quality is shite but the audio is there and that is the most important thing!

Enjoy or maybe be confused!!! Leave a comment!!!!
