,jen_eric999,2006-08-17T03:39Z,"Thanks for torrenting this, Mr. Bluesman!"
,drogos,2006-09-10T14:01Z,"Hello,
many thanks but it seems there is no links attached.
Regards,
Drogos"
,Yesmaniac,2008-01-26T00:48Z,This is why I don't like offering collectibles like this on public sites. Because they end up compressed. Bootlegs are already of questionable quality without destroying them like this with lossy compression.
,KiLLdead1336,2008-08-03T18:47Z,Please post part 1 & 2.
,mrt999,2010-03-12T17:53Z,"Part 1 is available and part two was as well but is no longer due to no one seeding it, however cd1 IS available and can be converted to video im happy myself
Thanks for uploading Mr_BluEsMaN your one of my new torrent heroes!"
