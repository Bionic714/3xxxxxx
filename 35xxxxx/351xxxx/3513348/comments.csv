,pitufoburlon,2006-08-17T16:13Z,Thanks a lot !!!

Is there a fifth season on enterprise?"
,doc99,2006-08-17T18:00Z,"Tak mange gange.
Er der nogle der har 
ST:TNG "
,El Jafar,2006-08-17T20:03Z,Tackar! Då får man äntligen se slutet på denna serie!
,El Jafar,2006-08-17T20:05Z,"Zyxen: No, there is no more Star trek at all. This is the last DVD produced and it doesn't look like there going to be any more in the future."
,uhura,2006-08-17T21:54Z,"Series got cancelled, but there might be some Motion pictures released..."
,Haldor_D,2006-08-19T19:49Z,There might be? :) There IS an 11th movie coming. Slated for release in 2008. Check out the poster for it here: http://www.startrek.com/startrek/view/news/article/19575.html
,VikingZombi,2006-08-20T10:19Z,Is'nt it a disk 7?
,Haldor_D,2006-08-20T15:53Z,Only 6 disks in season 4
,bantavoer,2006-08-22T09:34Z,"NO! There are 7 dvd's. But the 7th is a bonus dvd (?). 	
Star Trek Enterprise - Season 4 (7DVD)
  PAL"
,Haldor_D,2006-08-23T07:45Z,"Indeed, the 7th disc is a Best Buy bonus disc with a short featurette on it. As far as i'm concerned, not worth the cost of burning it onto a disc... But then all the seasons of Voyager and DS9 aren't complete either as there were Best Buy Bonus Dics for those as well (making most seasons 8 discs)"
,karthur,2006-08-25T16:51Z,I'm still missing season3 disc 5. Anything new about that?
,Haldor_D,2006-08-26T15:01Z,"This is the link given for disc 5 season 3.

,Rambo Killah,2006-10-18T22:24Z,How far have they come in season 4? more than episode 22?
