Gardens of Eden is a multidimensional tool of anthology guaranteed to whisk even the most hardcore urbanites into the folds of Shangri-la. This collection of music from around the world is built around the theme of paradise on earth; the highly detailed liner notes include an overview of environmental organizations pledged to preserve vanishing resources. The subdued, lighthearted music is constructed around the soft caress of acoustic guitar, ukulele, African kora, Polynesian drums, Indian tabla, and sitar. Exceptional tracks include Ana Rita Simonka's unique fusion of bossa nova and Indian classical music, "Mais Filhos de Gandhi," and Keola Beamer's soothing, oceanic "Elepaio Slack Key."
