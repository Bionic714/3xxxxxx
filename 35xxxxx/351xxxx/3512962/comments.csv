,Gazzaman,2006-08-21T13:55Z,This is Inner Fears but it won't work :(
,chamee,2006-10-08T21:35Z,dirty disc error!!! what can i do to make it work?
,FunkyHonky,2006-10-17T14:02Z,"It's not inner fears it's restless dreams, and it worked fine for me, well almost fine. in the part in the forest just before you get to silent hill, the trees are missing textures so they just appear as wierd black shapes, and a few other things are also missing textures also. once I was in the town of silent hill itself i didnt notice anything wrong though.

I don't know why it didn't work for you guys, if ur using unleashx, instead of using the A button to launch the game, press start and a menu should appear, then try the run game in pal/ntsc mode. Or you could try changing yous systems region setting."

,JimmBimm,2009-08-07T14:36Z,"Just Burn with imgburn works Fine...  but AFAIK it is Inner Fears because it is in German, English, etc. ... so it is the Euro Version.
