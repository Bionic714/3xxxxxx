,_-WoK-_,2006-08-21T07:41Z,"Thankyou Kvante :)

It seems to be harder being the first poster of torrents when school starts. I Noticed that someone got this episode before me this morning, but it was in RAR volumes and this one's not, so I'll keep this torrent."
,_-WoK-_,2006-08-21T07:50Z,"by the way, it says ""first aired Sunday, August 21"", but the 21'th is today and it's monday, so it should be saying August 20"

Do you have Blade The Series E1 & E2. I have E3-E5.......... Would really be great!!!"
