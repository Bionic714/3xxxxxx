,Pentika,2007-01-02T11:57Z,"there is a 3rd acidbath album for sale.  i forget what its called, i seen it in a fye once.  its a bunch of unreleased songs and demos.

dax has other bands though that are VERY much like acid bath. ""Agents of Oblivion"" is one, and ""Deadboy and the Elephant Men"" is the other one.

the deadboy project is a lot more acoustic.  one of the agents of oblivion albums has a (heavier) remake of Dead Girl.

if it wasnt for music we'd have no reason

thnx"
,Pentika,2007-01-06T09:07Z,"thanks for the torrent.  i'll seed this one out for a few weeks. i think everyone on earth needs to hear this music.  really great stuff.

thanks "

,Hewitt99,2008-05-15T15:51Z,Can someone upload the live bootleg dvd. I can't find it anywhere
,macgyver8181,2008-07-20T12:02Z,There was an album called Hymns of the Needle Freak and one called Screams of the Butterflies.  One of them was a demo cd that got them their record deal and the other was a live album.  I used to have them both but my ex girlfriend ripped them off.  I'm working on getting them both again and will seed them both when I get them.  If anybody out there has them please seed them.
