My 30 day activation period was already gone by 2 days and I couldnt close that freakin activation window or it would log me off. I had the key gen do 100 searchs, it found 2 keys within 25 passes and the first one worked!!
Thanks"

99% oc ""cracks"" will come up as a virus becuase they are ""hacking"" other software on your computer to bypass security measures or feature lock outs etc.
don't cry ""ZOMG VIRUS!!!11!!1"" becuase your anti-virus is telling you ""dont crack your XP, shame shame!"""
