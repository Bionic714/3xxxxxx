,Oye,2006-09-16T17:41Z,seed plz
,vespahespa,2007-12-12T20:57Z,"A good upload. Much appriciated. Especially for the YNQ albums. But unfortunatly I feel that I must point out that the following albums are incomplete:

Jaylib - Are Jaylib
Madlib - Remixes
Madvillian - Madvilliany (Madlib's Pre-Release Mix)
Madvillian - Madvilliany Koushik Remixes EP
VA - Stones Throw 101
VA - Peanut Butter Wolf's Jukebox 45's
YNQ - Angles Without Edges (intro only tough!)

Many thanks still. Just felt I had to let others now. And remember if you like what you hear. Go buy an album everynow and then since labels like Stones Throw deserves the support. Not many labels putting out as good and versatile music as Stones Throw. One love. "

Anyway, great program for organizing MP3s..."
,elyk1212,2008-01-06T00:31Z,"Oh, one more thing, MusicBrainz Picard is free, as in Beer and Freedom...."
,elyk1212,2008-01-06T22:43Z,"You know what, EasyTag is easier to use for just album naming.  But you can use Picard for a great ID23 tagger.

,laterthannever,2009-04-17T13:31Z,"what a bunch of garbage.

great music, but this is the worst torrent i've ever seen. learn how to seed. while you're at it, learn to organize your folders, romeo.

*sigh*"
,laterthannever,2009-04-17T13:35Z,my bad. i take it back. i seen this is an old torrent and you've obviously gotten your shit together since you've seeded it. apologies.
,JamesT67,2010-07-20T18:30Z,"Jesus H, i downloaded after reading the comments about tags thinking, how bad can it be? I took one look and deleted this sucker. No way I'm attempting  to organise this absolute shambles. To the creator- by taking some time out to organise this torrent you'd have saved everyone else a lot of time and hassle.

What a tit."

,windowwizard,2011-10-05T20:36Z,"When you add the files to ITUNES, they come out perfectly tagged and organized.

!!!!!"
,appidydafoo,2012-02-24T23:36Z,"Shittest. Torrent. Ever.

Is it free if you have to spend an hour fixing it? Go fuck yourself ""silentsprings"""
