,chronophobe,2006-09-07T16:54Z,"Call me retarded, but I can't seem to figure out how to delete the bad torrent of this...  Any hints?"
,chronophobe,2006-09-07T17:03Z,"Ah!  Forget it...  I spotted the tiny red ""X"" and deleted the old torrent that was missing a couple of songs.  (I think it wasn't showing up on Firefox - when I switched to Safari I was able to see it).  Enjoy the sweet Lips rarities!!!"
