Gothic Melancholy Vol.14 - Home made compilation by AssMaster
Released at The Pirate Bay
Quality differs from 128 kbps to vbr ~200 kbps, most songs
are around 192 kbps though. I haven't ripped these tunes,
they're picked from various albums, both scene and non-scene
releases. I take only credit for compiling the albums.
The songs are picked by me, and are for my listening pleasures,
so if you don't like them, I don't care. I you DO like them,
you're more than welcome to write a comment at TPB :)
The genres varies from gothic rock, metal, electronic and
death metal, all with the gothic feeling :)

Enjoy the stuff, and help to seed when done, as always :)
