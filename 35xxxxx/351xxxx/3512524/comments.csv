,jayman512,2007-01-18T09:56Z,"cmon guys....please seed this torrent after you download it... it took me forever to find this game and its really great. i would like to keep this one alive. for errrik81, yes you need an emulator to play the game as well as others. they come in the form of iso, cause you use discs for the games, rather than cartridges (that use ROMS)."
,HappyMojo,2007-02-03T06:08Z,"for some reason the icon for this game says its a golf game. however when i start it, its FF:Tactics  lol :P"
,username666,2007-12-19T20:33Z,"Just wanted to thank the original upper for this classic.  Even though his stupid fuktard ass wanted to use some password protected rar file.  

This is my all time favorite game ever for the PS1.  Used to play it over and over again."
,username666,2007-12-19T20:33Z,I plan to seed to at least 10:1.  If I get engrossed in the game again I plan on letting it seed indefinitely until I'm done playing the game.
,papajazz,2008-01-27T15:09Z,what is the password so I can play some ff tactics...thanks
,Oddlogic,2008-02-13T02:18Z,"If I can get the whole thing at this point, I will seed it back to life"
,menagerie,2008-04-24T05:55Z,"There's a fan-made patch for this game at auritech.eu that balances the mechanics out and increase difficulty; you can use CDMage to replace SCUS_942.21 with the patched version in their download section (import the patched file over the old one and it will work even though the timestamp doesn't change).

You can also replace SCEAP.DAT with the attachment in http://auritech.fantopolis.com/viewtopic.php?t=281 for an indication right at boot that the ISO was patched."
