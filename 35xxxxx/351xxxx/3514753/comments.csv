I screwed up a couple of times, you will too, but if you want something bad enough you will go get it. I seriously think i downloaded halo 2 six times before i figured out how to use it..... it just takes practice. a first download i would recommend is kaspersky antivirus, it kicks nortons ass anyday and uses less resources. The internet is like a hooker, its dirty, expensive, and you dont have alot of time to get to know it very well.
