,Supersten,2006-08-28T16:29Z,letar desperat efter det också... är nära på att köra igång med orginalet igen...
,learningd1,2006-09-04T02:40Z,"Eh? It's not a demo(although the installation process says that a file is missing)

The missing file seems to be the World War I scenario"
,tzare,2006-09-08T03:03Z,"Paradox games like victoria, hoi, eu etc doesnt have protections. Not even if its original."
,JuliusKaiser,2007-04-17T14:54Z,SEED PLEASE
,Rowena,2007-05-14T01:04Z,"Daemon tool wont find it!  i got Daemon manager v4.08HE

what to do?"
,bad_habit,2007-11-03T18:57Z,"the install says something about ""the original source being corrupted"". while the file that's missing it's just a bink file (a video intro i think) the game is unplayable, your stockpile will reset to 20 every couple of days, some cheats won't work, and if you patch it it won't start up again."
,MaxFinn,2008-01-19T12:00Z,Has a CRC error on the .BIN

,Krikon10,2008-06-22T11:39Z,"If u buy/download this game, DONT FUCKING INSTALL 1.04 PATCH!!!!!! IT SUCKS ASS"
,danostrife,2008-07-28T11:56Z,"Is anyone able to upload the TNTVillage version? That is 777MB, so there's no files missing. Everywhere I go for that, there's poor seeders; taking me 3 days to get it."
,Osinka,2008-11-17T04:31Z,"If you wanna avoid falls, errors and crap like that just install the official patch 1.04. Althought the game calls itself 1.04 when you apply this patch you'll see that it's 1.00 in a kinda weird way.
+Rowena
You've to unpack it and then you should see it when you choose to display all images. If you won't  just choose to display all FILES and find the one file that's BIN suffix. ... and enjoy this game ;-)"
