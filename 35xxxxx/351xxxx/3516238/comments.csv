,Jackio,2006-08-26T17:11Z,"Thanks!

btw, does anyone still have the Alphasim Catalina out there? Been looking for it..."
,luke97,2006-08-26T18:11Z,"Anybody have keys for WideFS and FSUIPC tested and working for use from a 2nd PC?
I tried all the emule ones, but, altough FSUIPC alone work OK, once I install the key for WFS (same user and email), FSUIPC does not work correctly as before, and WFS still does not work. The registration info seems ok, but... I fact, I never was able to make WFS work.  Any help from somebody that uses a 2nd PC? Tnx!"
,McPorra,2006-08-26T21:12Z,"FSUIPC & WideFS are both working in my system. If this is the reg (K6H3U8JQ2GZT) you're using for WFS, then it should be working. Is it possible that your firewall is blocking WFS? Good luck"

Ultimate Scenery Canaa/Alsaka is being seeded... download!!"
,Icebird1,2006-08-26T22:07Z,"same for me, WFS don't work.
as well the key of McPorra don't work:("
,zclown,2006-08-26T22:16Z,"Seems that registration aknowledge is NOW not enough for FSUIPC or WideFS. 
You have to test it in a real way :
 - external FS2004 applications for FSUIPC (IVAO, VasFMS, ...). If these applications are running fine, the FSUIPC key should be OK.
 - live Widefs tests using another PC."
,rrodger99,2006-08-27T01:01Z,"It seems that the author has redone the algorythmn & most of the cracked serials no longer work.

There was a discussion on usenet a couple of weeks ago."
,McPorra,2006-08-27T02:31Z,"OK, here's an update on the subject after a couple of tests: 
1. FSUIPC will work with the provided serial. 
2. WideFS won't. 
So, don't try to input the serial for WideFS, otherwise you will disable both modules. If you have done that, just remove the data for WideFS in the ""key"" file in the Module's folder and your FSUIPC will work again. "
,luke97,2006-08-27T07:44Z,I agree 100% MacPorra. Its exactly what happens. Anybody have a working combo? I need WFS urgently.  Tnx in advance!
,jerms,2006-08-27T08:30Z,"Thanks!

You know I was considering buying this program until I saw the price! You've got to be f'kn kidding me!

Plus he's the rudest prick on his forums, everytime I think about actually purchasing this I just read his last few posts and I'm cured again."
,subicbay,2006-08-27T11:28Z,"Here is a working alternative for FSUIPC

,luke97,2006-08-27T12:41Z,"Subicbay, the problem is the combo FSUIPC-WideFS. FSUIPC standalone already worked ok."
,subicbay,2006-08-27T13:34Z,"Luke 97

I know, this is why register both (combos combo FSUIPC-WideFS) with this keyGen in version 3.65
then update the dll-files.
keyGen works from Verson 3.x to 3.65 for FSUIPC andWideFS

THANKS"
,luke97,2006-08-27T18:15Z,"No luck. I still cant use FSCommander ot FSMoving map on my 2nd pc. The registration data is ok, ASV6 works right, and even the connection between WideFS and FS9 is ok, but once you try to run a progam that uses WFS, simply it doesnt works.  :-("
,sparksnmagic,2006-10-17T23:11Z,"A KeyGen-produced reg will make both FSUIPC and WideFS appear to work -- you can edit FSUIPC settings, the computers are talking, etc.  HOWEVER, if the key is not one that was PURCHASED, which is checked when FSUIPC fires up, then the processes will not work.  "
,mendoza1,2007-04-06T18:09Z,"guys.. FSUIPC and Widwfs works for me without problem..
