,NezzoX,2007-01-13T02:02Z,"Seriously jester77, u really need to grow up. If you dont learn to live with the rar format you should'nt download your stuff, you should buy your stuff with money, so you can complain about how you cant get the plastic wrap off and that you hate it or something.

And btw, thanks alot for this album, the movie sucked, but I liked the soundtrack."
,Sir Foxx,2007-01-28T22:21Z,The movie didn't suck just a really depressing view on life.  Thanks for the album.
