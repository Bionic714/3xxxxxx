,Massmordaren,2006-09-06T09:39Z,"I grew curious about the serial and downloaded the *other* Abacus Military Helicopters -package available on this site.
It turned out that the serial that redarrows offers is working perfectly with the other package - I will try to put together a nice reseed of both the Abacus Military Helicopters and the correct serial later today."
