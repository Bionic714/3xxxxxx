,Sniper1935,2006-08-25T04:51Z,"@ oneeyejack1 - It's in the pathetic RealMedia (rm) format for some reason :(  If you install Real Alternative (google it :) ) and get Media Player Classic you can then play it :) (You may notice slow down and speed up when playing though, I did but that may just be because my PC is old :( )  Any chance of an XviD version of this please deus2000 as this look's amazing! :D"
,Valentinoo,2006-08-25T08:26Z,"Sorry but the title is wrong

it's not ""Le Parfum de Mathilde""
but ""French Beauty""

the beautiful french is Mathilda, that's why you were probably wrong

One of the best french movies in my mind

Enjoy"

,paroxysme,2006-09-10T17:50Z,"This is remarkably good. Very high production values. Malthide is devastatingly beautiful and the film has a sense of humor. Lot's of clichĂŠs like high heels and tacky shaving, but still *very* entertaining. No subtitles. Practice your French!"
