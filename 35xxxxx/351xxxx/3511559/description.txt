ReSeed: (English SoundTrack, No Subtitles)

Inspector Morse (1987-2000) TV series, starring John Thaw as Chief Inspector
Morse, Kevin Whateley as Detective Sergeant Lewis, James Grout as Chief
Superintendent Strange and Colin Dexter in a guest role in each episode.

Set mostly in and around Oxford, Chief Inspector Morse tries to solve
various crimes he encounters. Perhaps the finest British detective series
ever.

Tech stuff:

Each episode is contained within a DivX 5.2 AVI, DVD rip, full frame 4:3,
448x336 pixels, 733kbps, 25 frames/second. Audio 192kbps MP3,
original English soundtrack, mono for episodes 1-22, stereo for the others.

Since each episode is somewhere between 100 and 105 minutes in length, the
resulting AVI size is less than 700 MB, but the video definition is still
0.195 bits/pixel which is very good for a non-action (ie. no pyrotechnics)
film.
