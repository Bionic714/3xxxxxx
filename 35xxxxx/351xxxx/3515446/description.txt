One of the most influential countries in the world of music, South Africa has been the homeland of some of the greatest popular music artists of our time. From the global success of Miriam Makeba and Hugh Masekela in the 1960s to the groundbreaking work of Juluka and Paul Simon with Ladysmith Black Mambazo in the 1980s, the music of South Africa has introduced millions of people to international sounds. 
"South African Legends" is a retrospective of work by artists who are important figures both at home and abroad. In some cases, the artists on this collection are legends around the world. South African Legends is a tribute to a country whose social and political history has taught all of us the importance of perseverance and the ultimate triumph of social justice. It also celebrates a land where the joy and power of music has served as inspiration and relief for millions struggling for a better life.
