I was online all the time and there were lots of peers who tried to DL, But bitlord never started uploading. So I stoped using bitlord and tried with azureus instead. The problem dissapered almost instantly.
Bitlord sucks when it comes tro seeding."
,stewed_meat,2006-08-22T03:49Z,"Well, I tried to download on azureus and I'm stuck on 54.6% same as bitlord 1.1. 
So now what??"
,stewed_meat,2006-08-23T03:29Z,Are there any seeders out there? I'm still stuck on 54.6%
,gaiag,2006-08-25T16:09Z,i've been stuck at 54.6 for days now...  booo
,gallaghersen,2006-08-26T23:20Z,"Scottish Lad: Use another torrent client, like utorrent...upload this again. Please! There's a guide here: http://teoulas.myname.gr/"
,UFOelectric,2006-10-08T21:03Z,"saamo- How peers connect to you when your seeding has nothing to do with what torrent client your using.  Some clients seem to work better for others but if you are having probs seeding its most likely your port/pc config/router etcc.  By just downloading another client can fix those prob's for you and make you think the client you had before sucked when it wasn't the client it was the user/pc config.

I for one have used Bitlord and found it to be the best torrent client by far.  I have used azureus, utorrent, bittorrent, bitcomet, and have found Bitlord to download and upload faster than all of those other more popular torrent clients I just listed.  Bitlord also has by far in my opinion the best and easiest software user interface to navigate.  utorrent has everything all over the place and I was amazed at how well Bitlord is organized compared to the more popular clients.

But then again thats my opinion and everyone uses what works for them, I'd also like to note that most people I refer to Bitlord that are using AZ, utorrent, bitcomet etc.. never go back once they see how much an advantage you have w/ using bitlord.  Many torrent info websites have also claimed that more peers have a better chance of connecting to someone that seeds from Bitlord, which completely contradicts your statement that you made.  I'll try and find those links, or you can ""google"" ""best torrent clients"" and Bitlord is highly recomended in those search results but still not nearly the most popular as other clients like AZ and utorrent."
,brassman,2006-11-16T20:49Z,Chirst! Everybody... Use Utorrent! The fastest and simplest client on the web!
