I have loved Nina Simone's ferocity and intelligence and music forever. She is very very real. a resource to draw upon in this dark time when truth seems scarce. I give this album 5 stars on the strength of the single track that I've heard...West Wind. I heard this song on the radio while I was driving late one night recently and was transported by its power. An African prayer for transcendence, the song begins in a whisper and builds slowly upon the accompaniment of a band of truly master drummers to a place of shining mystery, freedom, and release. Nina sings with breathtaking wisdom fully aware of all complacent dangers, praying for us all to be taken up and lifted to safety. Nina for president!!
