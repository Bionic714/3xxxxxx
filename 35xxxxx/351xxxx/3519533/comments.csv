,Untrustable,2006-09-16T10:37Z,"I encountered a cheat before at CS S
I loaded 'm up with all i got, but the opponent seemed to be unvulnerable.
So he kicked my ass instead.
I Fraps-ed him, (recorded), including all data that came along.
So far i couldn't find 'm.
I also met some kind of a auto-aim bot at Americas Army at a bridge map. This one shot everybody within 13 seconds even when he faced at you backwards.
Is this torrent about the same thing?
I dont call it noob-alike. Its a funny kind of programming, which i like to learn more about.
Dont worry, Me, UnTrustable will not use any cheats or some graphic-card setting tricks to do some winning."
