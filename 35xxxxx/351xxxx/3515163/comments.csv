,poxy1,2006-11-16T05:35Z,"To anyone who wonders how this list was compiled, RS Magazine basically asked of a bunch of industry insiders (musicians, producers, song writers, etc) to submit a list of top 50 songs, and then they made the list from that input. i admit it's not the list i would have made, but there's a lot of good songs on here, nonetheless."

,swoner420,2007-09-11T07:20Z,"OK.. so i took the time to sit down and read a few comments on this list and decided i would answer some questions that ignorant people don't seem to understand.. first, this list was made in 2004 and came out in the december issue of that year.. it is compiled of the GREATEST songs voted by music artists, producers, writers, radio hosts, etc...  for example  elvis costello, jakob dylan, ?uestlove, Ozzy, slash, and so many more.. they chose the songs that represented the original idea of a song; a few riffs worked out on an electric guitar or lyrics scribbled on a legal pad that became great music...  now as far as the list.. i noticed a few songs so far are not labeled right.. so i am taking it as my personal duty to fix this since i own this mag..  Now for all the people that seem to have a problem with how this list ended up.. you should get the dick out of your ear and really listen to music for once and see why its in the place it is.. just because it gets played more than shit does not mean it needs to be at the top.. you gotta realize why this list was made..  Im only 21 and i appreciate the fuck out of this list.. every single song..  grow up people..  its not the end of the world if red hot chill fuckers didn't make the list..  but anyways.. fuck it.. "

Can you please properly tag all the songs that you upload. It is like having a second job just to organize my music library. And everyone who downloads these music songs has to tag and organize them, some of the lazy people just toss it in and have a ""whatever-the-fuck cluster-fuck"" of a music library.

Some of us freedom fighters would like not to have to slave constantly to properly ID3 tag the songs we download.

,Tragonn,2009-06-01T00:34Z,"To Akyel and every other moron that say this list sucks:
Best of is relative to the listener. You might not like it and it might not be on YOUR top 500. However there are 6 billion people out there and they all got their own best 500. And for your information U2 is one of the most popular band in the world history. They are legends with bands like Rolling Stones, Beatles, Abba, Elvis etc etc
So I would think that there is a hell of a lot of people that have them on their top 500."
,baggytooth,2009-06-04T06:12Z,Here's a really good current band that draws their influence from the classics... http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4917451/Penguin_-_Traveling_Songs_(2008)

,asulik,2009-06-18T00:51Z,"never ever will we agree on greatest song list, each 1 of us hav diff. preferences
nice coll btw, keep it up..."
,vanillaicecream,2009-06-22T08:03Z,"Tragonn,

Did you actually just put Abba in the same sentence with the Beatles and Rolling Stones? 

Only way I can see this happening is if you were IN Abba! And even then, could someone really be that delusional?

Thats like comparing the Black Eyed Peas with fuckin' Mozart man."
,Kate68,2009-06-23T02:15Z,"4 Tragonn, yes I am an avid fan of U2 (really one of my true faves), and I think they are one of the influntial bands of the past almost 30 years. Although they really needed to apoligize for the album ""POP""; ugh, what a real piece of shit, but otherwise... very talented; next to the Beatles, Doors, Smashing Pumpkins (Siamese Dream of course), and Coldplay, Heart ect... Definitely part of the cream of the crop. I'm only 27, but for some reason it seems that most music released post 2000, sucks ass. One good thing that my Mom actually taught me is how 60's and 70's music was nearly historically exceptional ( and I truley believe that w/ all my heart). On the other hand, asuilk is right on the subject in question, because NO ONE is ever going to agree on what is considered what the ""best"" songs of all time are, because everyone is different. O.K. I did't read all the comments, but vanillaicecream maybe some what right (hmmm I dunno). Sure ABBA certainly isn't the Stones or Beatles, but they are definitely one of the earliest intial cornerstones of a genre that we all now refer to as ""Pop music"". Personally maybe their music was'nt legendary, but it is a hell of alot better than all the dribble that Britney Spears, or any other crap""boybands"" for that matter has produced."
,Kate68,2009-06-26T03:02Z,"Damn, forgot to mention the Who, Steve Miller, The Drifters, and Fleetwood Mac.  I'm only in my 20s, so I tend to overlook this shit (lol) Sorry, I hope that is a broad and respectable enough preference.  I hope that it's within your preference, If not, then you are totally & pathetically SOL"
