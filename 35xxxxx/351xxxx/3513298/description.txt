Rip 320kbs
Cover included

Putumayo World Music is pleased to present Mexico, a collection of compelling songs from a country whose musical culture is as diverse as its landscape. From the sones of Veracruz to the boleros of Oaxaca, Mexican music is both upbeat and poignant, and offers listeners a surprising array of traditional and contemporary sounds. 
There are many reasons why people from around the world travel to Mexico, from the beauty of its natural landscape to the richness of its culture. Some probably just love the food! We hope that this collection reminds anyone who is from or has visited Mexico of the enchantment it offers, and encourages those who have never been to discover its charm and beauty.
