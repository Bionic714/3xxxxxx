,paladijn,2006-09-04T19:42Z,"geweldig, bedankt voor de download"
,snafas,2006-09-24T10:55Z,"Is it only me or has no one noticed that this iso is partly broken? There are supposedly four episodes on this disc, but when when you click on ""Once More Unto the Breach"" in the menu you get the wrong episode (""The Siege of AR-558""). The menu works fine for the other three episodes.

If anyone could seed a proper version of this disc it would be greatly appreciated.

By the way, if anyone could help seeding the first season torrents for DS9 it would also be very much appreciated as there are a couple of  us that are stuck on 96.7% (SE01DVD2) and 35.4% (SE01DVD03). I haven't started downloading the other season one torrents yet, but perhaps help is needed with those too.

Many thanks!

(No disrespect intended. A great thanks to all original uploaders and other seeders that keep these torrents alive.)"
,Mqq,2007-02-19T13:26Z,"This disc could use someone to seed the last bits, only seeing one with about 97% done..."
,Mqq,2007-02-19T13:30Z,Needs seeder... :/
,kvistarn,2007-07-30T12:13Z,does anyone have s6 disk3? It would be very nice if anyone could upload it...
