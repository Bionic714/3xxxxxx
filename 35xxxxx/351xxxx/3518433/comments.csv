,JunirCat,2006-09-24T01:00Z,"what is a seeder and what is a leacher?  All foreign language to me.

My hubby had his Medion GPS nicked from his car (and the windows smashed in) & bought a Tomtom One. He did'nt realise that we need the maps of Europe for us & the kids & the grankids to go to Spain on our 1st hols for 5 years. Can you help me work out what I need to get to copy & paste to an SD card please?"

Regards,
