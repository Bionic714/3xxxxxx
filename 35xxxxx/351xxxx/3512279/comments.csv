,turk182,2006-08-14T03:02Z,"thanks for this, its the only one i download, cool you just uploaded it"
,GasGiver4711,2006-08-14T04:07Z,"Qiji : Nope, there is no Website - You will always find the latest Release here first."

,Jedih,2006-08-14T10:13Z,"GasGiver4711: Superb release!

I just can't get the QuickTime movie browser script nor the Game browser script to work with the latest releases. I have configured the network option as I always has done before and my router are working as it should. Anyboby else who has this problem?

Also the ""My movies"" doesn't work. My movies are located in the ""Movies"" folder on my E drive but they don't show up. I have deleted the 2 folders in the UDATA and TDATA (can't remeber what the names where...somenthing an 8 in the name!) but that doesn't help!"
