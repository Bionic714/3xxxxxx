   RELEASE NOTES:

   Configurable! Shortcut for -C-Drive included.
   Points to E:/Apps/XBMC/default.xbe by default. Configurable in the .cfg file.
   To use XBMC as Dash it┬┤s the only way now. The ┬┤old way┬┤ is no option anymore.
   Rename the .xbe AND the .cfg to something your BIOS can boot - eg. evoxdash.xbe 
   and evoxdash.cfg then copy both files to your -C-Drive.
   Weblink in docs/XBMC-Manual.url now correctly points to new XBMC Manual.
   Weblink to XBMC Changelogs updated in .nfo

   CHANGELOG:

   To keep this .nfo shorter, I only list the topmost 3 lines here, so you can
   see what┬┤s included here. Always read the official XBMC Changelog at  
   http://xbmc.cvs.sourceforge.net/xbmc/XBMC/Changelog.txt?view=markup
   You can also find it in /docs/Changelog.txt

   13-08-2006 changed: renamed some variables. system.screenshotpath
                       -> pictures.screenshotpath, mymusic.recordingpath
                       -> musicfiles.recordingpath.
   13-08-2006 updated: mplayer.dll with support for aac and aac+ streams.
   13-08-2006 fixed: listcontrol and listcontrolex would wraparound instead of
                     going to ondown if it where at the max page size of the list
