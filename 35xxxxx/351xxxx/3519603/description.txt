
This is the second chapter of Thomas Babington Macaulay's 
History of England from the Succession of James II.

In this chapter we see the restoration of the House of Stuart. 
The mood of the people sours toward the Roundheads, Army and, 
of course the Puritans. An examination of the character of 
Charles II. We see Charles attempting to recruit assistance 
from France so he can attain absolute monarchy and so emulate 
Lewis the Fourteenth, the French Sun King.
