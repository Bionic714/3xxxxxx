The movie looks alright, but there's a watermark that's at the top of the movie reading ""Property of Nordisk Film A/S"" It does take up part of the screen, so don't think it's above it, where the black space is.
The movie itself looks slightly fuzzy, but not too bad. I might look for a better version though, without the text on the top."
