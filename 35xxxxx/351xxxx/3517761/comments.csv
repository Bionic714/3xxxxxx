,ctrlaltde1337,2006-12-05T18:23Z,"O seeder, where art thou? :("
,ctrlaltde1337,2006-12-05T19:07Z,"located a file which might make this torrent fully seeded again (by me), we'll see if it makes it through the hash check..."
,ctrlaltde1337,2006-12-05T19:20Z,"Didn't work, replacement file was identical to the incomplete one in the torrent. (missing first part of cedega-small-5.2.3-1.i386.rpm). I'm really disappointed now. :("
,ctrlaltde1337,2006-12-05T19:40Z,"found another file which I am quite sure is complete... doesn't work in this torrent though, it must be the ""cedega""-file causing the problem. (if anyone is still interested in the file cedega-small-5.2.3-1.i386.rpm, msg me and I'll lead you to it.)"
,Lierodeath,2006-12-19T20:24Z,I wouldnÂ´t mind :)
