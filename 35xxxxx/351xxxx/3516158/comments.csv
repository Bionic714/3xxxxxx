,=Xarus=,2006-08-26T15:12Z,Ehh... Thx for leaving all the subs.. but which subs might that be..? And as =michael= said plz never remove anything except if u cant get it over 53% while shrinking it... :) and gz on ur first torrent...
,ClaudiuS51,2006-08-26T15:37Z,"I wonder when you start seding it? Maybe, since it your first torrent, you dont know that you have to download the uploaded torrent. That you cant just start the one you made!"
,daga01,2006-08-26T15:53Z,subs ?
,amicdeb,2006-08-26T17:15Z,Is it working better now?
,xyncro,2006-08-26T19:14Z,..why are you not seeding..? i've been connected for a little over 6 hours and not a single percent received.. are you perhaps doing this wrong.. with seeding it i mean..? you know you have to download your own torrent file.. that's the way we find you.. after that you stay connected until one of us has it.. it's as simple as that..
,amicdeb,2006-08-26T20:40Z,OK...I think I got it now...btw there was ONLY English subtitles in the DVD...
,=michael=,2006-08-26T21:05Z,you can check it with the program dvd shrink!!!
,ClaudiuS51,2006-08-26T21:29Z,"No, it still doesnt work properly, maybe it's your firewall preventing the proper communication?"

,ClaudiuS51,2006-08-30T11:51Z,Decent upload? Less than 1 Gb in 4 days! Are you seeding this from a dialup?
,ClaudiuS51,2006-08-30T13:42Z,"Please, turn on superseed, or as it's called in utorrent, initial seed!!"
,amicdeb,2006-08-30T23:51Z,I'm uploading at 30k/sec with an adsl connection
,ClaudiuS51,2006-09-01T07:41Z,You STILL have to turn on superseed!! This is rediculous!! 1/3 DVD in six days!

And a supprice iÂ´ts not ""Timeline"" no no this is
