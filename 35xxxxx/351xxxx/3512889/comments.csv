,ZooAntelope,2006-08-16T05:55Z,"p.s. if anybody's interested, you can make a simple UDP server to hijack the calls to cod2master.activisionc.om:20700 and return ""accept"" for every request - this works too, and also means you don't have to overwrite anything, *and* it works for every version of COD2, but I figured it was easier to release an exe for people"
,ZooAntelope,2006-08-16T06:04Z,"p.p.s.  if you are interested in what I changed (i.e. suspicious like I would be) just do a file compare on my exe compared to the original 1.3 mp exe.  You'll see all I've changed is ""accept"" to ""deny"" :)"
,Ewald90,2006-08-30T16:24Z,Is there no way of creating a client fix for COD2 1.3 MP? I have not seen any decent working ones around since the original COD2 came out.
,axelib,2006-12-17T07:55Z,Is this a crack to that doing so you can play on internet?

,mofoelite,2008-04-28T23:10Z,"206.222.26.18:28960 cracked server pb is on so no hacks allowed

make sure you update your game to 1.5"
