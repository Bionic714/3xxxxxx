Release notes: One of the most intriguing bands on Polish atmospheric dark metal scene returns with new, disturbing album, which will send cold shivers down your spine.... New dimension of dark metal, new voice and the band's new face: the darkness remained, but the music is more melodic now. For all who love to submerge in Katatonia or Paradise Lost climates. "The Event Horizon" - a great comeback of the genre harbingers!

Enjoy and please seed.
