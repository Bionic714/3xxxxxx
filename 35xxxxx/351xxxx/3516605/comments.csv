,eldianarda,2006-08-27T20:05Z,"I'm trying to seed but i'm new at this and it only says connection, not connected. Can't find any imformation on what to do either. If you want me to seed than help me."
,eldianarda,2006-08-27T20:05Z,"Sorry, meant that it says connecting."
,screenslave,2006-12-20T18:58Z,"Great torrent to put out, but the picture's not very sharp - a disappointment. Have tried various programs to get it clearer, but nothing's worked so far. Still, thanks for the initiative!"
,bakewell,2007-01-21T21:25Z,"What do you need to play these videos?  Windows media Player does not seem to recognise them
Thanks"
,bobcprimus,2007-04-08T18:49Z,"If you are having Player problems then try VLC player, i was turned on to this by a friend here on Pirate Bay an have never looked back, if i have a file causing problems then i'll play it in VLC check it out here - http://www.videolan.org/

,joe313,2007-09-08T04:33Z,Excellent show. Hilarious. Love it. Downloaded great. Got entire first and second seasons. Thanks.
,Cat,2008-03-14T14:37Z,"I've heard there is a concluding single episode, like a single s3 episode or a special. does anyone have it? torrent?"
,Jonesing,2008-07-05T02:39Z,"Thanks for the series :)

Also, seconding what Cat said, does anyone have the christmas special final episode? I loved the ending of it, very true to the show."
,serellie,2009-03-15T17:19Z,"I downloaded the 1st three episodes, and I was really disappointed in the quality. Not only is the picture mediocre quality, but there are black bars at the top and bottom hard coded in. A shame. 

I appreciate the hours that went into encoding, and the hours of seeding. Thanks for the effort."
,pukkalover,2009-06-20T02:52Z,YOU ALL SUCK DONKEY DICK...no seeds and the other torrent 'season 1' as 2 seeds.  WOOPDY FOOKIN DOOOOOO   eta...Just after the sun explodes.  I really wanted this series was a great show.  Thanks for nothing you spiteful kants
,pukkalover,2009-06-20T02:59Z,Nevermind it's seeded much better on isohunt. Thank's eldianarda.    booo to the pb seeders
,nickridiculous,2010-01-27T03:34Z,"Thanks Elidianarda!

The other torrent on PB is missing SE2EP4 so I'm getting it here."
,Saki33,2011-01-08T06:34Z,"Hey thanks eldianarda! You did a good job. I've only just watched s01e01 so far but excellent quality for that one. 

I found subs for this at Subscene, the one that suits esselkuit. They are HI, but a quick job to remove them with Subtitle Edit 3.0.  The others don't synch. If you aren't Brit you might need them. I was not catching all the words and my hearing is pret-ty good."
,Vynbos,2011-09-15T07:51Z,"Bad Video Compression. For this quality you'd expect far smaller file sizes. The effort is appreciated, but a little bit of time spent on improving compression techniques would improve your uploads in the future."
,Vynbos,2011-09-15T10:33Z,"Sorry, I meant to post the above comment on another Green Wing Torrent. The video here, though not great, is good enough. "
,clumsyshadow22,2012-08-05T00:31Z,"Brilliant Thanks!
This show is one of a kind. Genius!!"
,uheardmebitch,2012-09-01T16:08Z,"the ratio is fukked. to fix, use media player classic > view > over-ride aspect ratio > 16:9 picture is good otherwise. thanks for the up"
