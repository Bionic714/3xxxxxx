,LaikaRoonie,2006-11-12T23:46Z,Ouuuh! Great stuff!!
,Oberlus,2007-02-27T21:21Z,"Nice one, Mate! Thanks!"
,insecure_abnormality,2007-03-08T02:30Z,"Em, might be a fairly odd question, but why can't i get the sandman rar file to unpack? It keeps sayin it can't extract because the file names can't be over 120 characters long. Is it something to do with the version of winRAR i'm using or what's the story??"
,darklingmiss,2007-06-17T16:52Z,"To insecure_abnormality, you just have to move it to your root directory or like one folder down. That should shorten the file names.

Also, I had to re-rar some of the Sandman files to where CDisplay would load them properly. But overall, a great torrent and well worth the download. Thanks!!!"
,ishba,2007-08-18T14:35Z,"winRAR keeps telling me that page 21 of Books of Magic #18 is corrupted- anyone else having this problem?

Otherwise this is a great torrent!"
,HenrikOlsen,2007-10-13T11:34Z,"Where's The Last Temptation, Harlequin Valentine, Sandman: Dream Hunters, Violent Cases, Stardust, Mr. Punch : The Tragical Comedy or Comical Tragedy, 1602?
It's not complete if it doesn't have everything:)"
,Bossman69,2007-11-18T01:26Z,"It's also missing Sandman: Endless Nights, adding to its lack of Completeness."
,Myself980,2008-01-18T03:46Z,"More incompleteness!  Although since it isn't anywhere else, you're forgiven.  Anyone know where Signal to Noise is?"
,IAmBill,2008-05-08T04:19Z,"I downloaded this for Sandman. Unfortunately, a majority of the comics are listed, but missing. (Folder with no files)"
,Hell76Lx,2009-01-12T13:51Z,cant read it with comicrack...why???
,mcon1964,2010-06-04T20:10Z,"Just to add to the incompleteness, where's
Stardust?"
