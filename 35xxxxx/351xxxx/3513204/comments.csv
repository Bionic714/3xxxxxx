Tnx mate!!!!

,FSSR.Keyno,2006-08-17T08:04Z,"Got F1 traffic and Military traffic too. I dont use GA, because too slow on APP, and Comm have 2go around. I will install this addon when FSX comes out.
thanks for the file, and no, ive not heard of this file.
also, the latest BGLMAN crack crashes with the new F-4F Phantom ver 1.00 by C9, bummer

ciao"
,The_Hangar_18,2006-08-17T10:11Z,"Hmm thx.

I used MyTraffic 2 Years ago. But before 4 weeks, i testet F1's Traffic, and i don't like it. Then i testet Justflight's, and i thing that was amazing. The aircrafts, and the density, nice. @Mytraffic the loading time from fs9 stuck after install, it takes a much longer time to load. The aircrafts don't look good, the performance, i thing mytraffic is a performance killer. But i was very afraid about the quality of Traffic 2005. Very good performance, and the aircrafts look very well. At least, the small bonus tweak programs are fine.
I'll test this Adobe AI Pack, too^^ Maybe there is a other package that can top Mytraffic 2005, we will see.

Ty for uploading, rrodger99"

,rrodger99,2006-08-17T13:41Z,"Since my Korean is a bit rusty , I am having a bit of difficulty reading that site.

From what I gather though there is no dnload link for the 4.6 package because of the issues they are having with the modelers at AI Aardvark & AI Porject screaming that they are using their freeware to make better freeware.....go figure."

Don worry Crillie, the C9 Phantom will be ours soon and you cant do anything. :-)  Fuck you!"

Do you know if it is the latest 4.6 version?"

You should begin you an occupation to search..."
,NullCharacter,2006-08-17T17:05Z,"As for the C9 Phantom, have you guys tried using the BGLMAN.DLL crack that is included with some of the C9 sceneries?

This plane uses the same protection so it might work unless they've updated the file with this release."
,MCFC OK,2006-08-17T18:32Z,"They are constantly updating the BGLMAN.DLL

,BaMordi,2006-08-18T12:28Z,PSS B777 has been updated! Anyone? :)
,fsx_2k6,2006-08-18T12:42Z,I downloaded the files (traffic 4.6) and none of them will allow me to extract the files. I think we're missing the 1st file which I believe the link was e-mailed to people and not posted for the public.
,scooby321999,2006-08-18T14:05Z,From what I can gather after translating with Google.. it seems you need to send an e-mail and you get the download link to part one.. but that link expires after some time.. Again I am not sure.. but there is definetly some sort of application process to get part one... 
,scooby321999,2006-08-18T14:05Z,"All other parts of v4.6, including the Traffic pack will not work unless you have part one!

Anyone who speaks Korean here that can help us out?"

we need set 1.

I was wondering that too. Where do i get the first one!"

you get it to work? How?"
,easypeasy,2006-08-18T17:12Z,"Only problem with this package...  the traffic sliders don't work.

Planes are gorgeous, great traffic coverage.  But you can't turn it down at all.  At 100% traffic I get the same as 3% traffic, so it seems.

Anyone else get this, or am I just huffing glue?  Any fixes for this?

(Still a good thread to share, though.  Thanks)"
,rrodger99,2006-08-18T17:55Z,"@easy

I have read (I forget where) that you will not see any difference in the traffic from 40-100% but under 40 it will reduce the traffic.

There is a 4.61 part but it was pulled from the site...possibly an instal issue? I have aalso seens hints of a legality issue in some of the Korean forums but the translation is not that good.

There has to be a Korean air pirate out there somewhere that can help us out."
,rrodger99,2006-08-18T17:57Z,"Oh yea...@gippone thanks for the great links.

I tried clicking on some stuff but nothing ever worked."

My wife has a friend at work that is Korean & while she doesn't speak Korean she may know someone that does.

appreciate your effort. Will be awaiting for great news."

,fsx_2k6,2006-08-18T23:49Z,"@easypeasy 

The problem is that the author complied all the traffic using 100% traffic. Can't do much unless you decompile the entire traffic package and manually set the traffic which will take a lonnnnnng time."
,easypeasy,2006-08-19T17:10Z,"@fsx_2k6

Yeah, that's what I figured.  Maybe their new package spreads it around to different percentages.  I'll bet someone here will get it soon, and post it.  Come on, you intrepids souls!!

But man these models look great.

I have posted to usenet about the drop in traffic & thats just an oddity...most others see traffic at 100% & gatwick stays packed. I just have to wonder if it has to do with me uninstalling JustFlight Traffic 2005.

If anyone has Traffic 2005 still installed can you post the follow me van that comes with the package? I don't want to reinstall it just to grabe the file & that is a great way just to cruise around these great sceneries."

,legendary_goku,2006-08-23T09:59Z,Jackybacky maybe you didn't install it correctly and are you sure that your slider is set to 100%? I wouldn't dare to put it on 100%...Last time i tried 30% traffic and Frankfurt was filled at every gate and almost every parking with an aircraft...The visual models are better than any ai traffic package out there

,luke97,2006-09-02T23:17Z,"I found a solution for the 100% traffic.
The problem is that most of the flight plans have 1% volume on them. What it means this 1%? Simply that if you put your traffic slider on 1 or more, youÂ´ll have 100% traffic. The only option is change this 1% for  i.e. 50%. This means that if you put your traffic slider on 49%, you will only see the other flights that have a number lesser than 50% on them. A lot of flights have 30%.  The solution is de-compile with TTools the Traffic_AdobeTP_4_4.bgl file and change the 1% valors inside FlightPlans_AdobeTP_4_4.txt for i.e. 50%.  
Recompiling the file again give us a corrected traffic file. Simply exchange the old file for the new one and voila! We have Adobe AI traffic with working traffic slider.

""We don't providing ATP for foreigners(not korean). Do not ask by anything.""

I think that's why AVSIM told them to fuck off.

The download links on their web site seem to be broken too.

If the AI aircraft telefrag you, and you need to decompile the pack to get the proper traffic density then it doesn't seem like a worthwile download. Might as well put in the models and flightplans one by one."
