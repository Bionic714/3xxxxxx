,Astralia,2006-09-03T23:40Z,Thanks but there seem to be none seeding!?
,masukie,2006-09-04T23:52Z,Is this a Fake? Just a fucked up big rar file. Maybe included trojan infection!
,snapdragon470,2006-09-05T12:36Z,There were one or two seeds a couple of days ago but they appear to have faded into the woodwork. Maybe someone else can help.
,Astralia,2006-09-05T16:35Z,and the u/l doesnt seem to answer on pvtmsg.
,Astralia,2006-09-07T03:34Z,FUCK YOU FOR NOT COMPLETING YOUR U/L YOU FUCKING ASSHOLE!!! ILL GO D/L THIS FROM DC++ INSTEAD!!!!!
,markB.,2006-09-11T21:38Z,"sorry i couldnt seed before, my internet crashed. a bunch of people got both torrents before it crashed so shit on them for not seeding too. ill seed as soon as i can"
,markB.,2006-09-11T21:42Z,this is the real deal. i had to put it into a rar file so bitcomet would create the torrent (it had too many files to create as a folder)
,audioVST,2006-09-12T11:24Z,More VST for the people !!!!!

,TheSilencer,2006-12-14T17:46Z,"If you two who have 100% of this torrents just puts it on high priority so that I can get the last 7% I will dedicate it 200K/s in upload for a long time.

That would be great for the rest of the leechers.
Great torrent, but very slow swarm."
,TheSilencer,2006-12-14T17:49Z,And I can confirm that this seems to be the real deal. Disk one contains the keygen from H2O. :)

,pjacosta,2008-02-06T10:15Z,"Listen, 

  I'm trying to use this plug-in on a PC.  I've downloaded these sound libraries already--my hope was that I could download the free version of Sonik Synth, officially register it with the manufacturer, and then just insert the sound libraries I torrented into the sound directory.  Unfortunately, I think that Sonik Synth 2 has stopped letting people download and register the free version.  The keygen works fine, but to register the product you need a MATCHING serial number, System ID #, and Authentication number.  So my question is, could anyone who has successfully installed this plug-in with a MATCHING set of serial numbers, please give me all three of yours, so I can start using this big ol' libary of awesome samples.  PLEASE.  I desperately want to try it out."
,cyberdine,2008-02-23T15:14Z,"Who have a sonik synth standalone version v2.1? I would like to try it, please."
,eArtrash,2008-06-23T12:06Z,"these are huge files, really hoping it is a s good as i hear! please keep on seeding! its all about the share! :)"
,skinup,2008-07-21T12:41Z,"when installing the keygen says it needs digi-ID before i can get the authentication code, where is the Didi-ID? I've done this before i the past but forgotten what to do :P"
,skinup,2008-07-21T12:44Z,^^ not intsalling I meant when I try to open it in cubase it says it needs activating. 
,SeederMan11,2008-08-31T01:19Z,"Downloading.... Name says it all, so if it's legit... YOUR WELCOME!"

,po-po187,2010-02-28T08:25Z,"Can someone for the love of all things good and holy spell out how to find the sysid/digi ID needed to generate the authorization code for this keygen?

Thank you in advance"
,psyjunta,2010-07-05T03:55Z,"Download the amplify keygen generator instead. I had mine from an old sampletank torrent and it worked fine. I uploaded it here for easy access if you're brave enough to click the link ;)

2shared . com / file / i5qhY2JS / Keygen.html

Delete the spaces

All you need to do is choose which application you want the keygen to crack on the right and then press the generate button. Easy."
,GodlySeeds,2010-07-07T11:29Z,"heres a couple of serials with auth codes for those having troubles, enjoy!

,sw3120,2010-10-12T18:15Z,"quik tutorial on how to generate all three codes needed (serial, digi id, auth code)

do the following after installation
1. generate serial using keygen
now open you host app (reason, cubase, fl studio....etc)
load the Sonik Synth vst ( the serial code shit should come up)
2. request new authentication code
3. choose the option to connect using another computer
4. select - dont have existing account
5. you should now see your Digi ID - highlight and right click  copy (dont push the copy 

button thats to the right of it)
6. past your digi id in the keygen and generate your authentication code
7. go back to your installer window, click back 3 times and select use existing 

autthentication code
8. click next
9. paste it here
10. next and you should be done

Ur Welcome :)
