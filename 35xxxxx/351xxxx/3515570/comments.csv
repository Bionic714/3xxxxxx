,Silverlock,2006-11-19T08:07Z,"I REALLY want to see this one!!
...but, this has no subs.  No English (which i need) or any others.  

*pout*

ahh well...maybe one day i'll catch it.

Also, as a warning...this version is VERY POORLY compressed.  There are major artifacts and other picture degradation issues.  I'd suggest trying one of the other versions out there..."
