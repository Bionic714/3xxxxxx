,bnb098,2007-03-12T21:11Z,"I got the same error.  If you notice, the missing file name contains a registered mark (速) after Spots.  Rename the file to contain this (alt +0174).  Reburn a CD and reinstall.  This should fix your problem."

,hellov37,2007-07-02T04:27Z,"For west map:
Rename '...west v5.msi' (remove 速);
Edit setup.ini -->change PackageName to match above new name: 
PackageName=MapSource - US Rec Lakes with Fishing Hot Spots West v5.msi."
,FlamingAnt,2007-07-06T06:04Z,"could someone give a little more detail to how this works, i downloaded the west only map, changed the program name and changed what that one file had written in it, ran the setup, but when i use mapsource, the recreational lakes map won't show."
