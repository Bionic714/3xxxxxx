ALL 3 ISO's WEST, CENTRAL, EAST, just burn to cd with your burning program
AS Always with the Garmin stuff I upload there is no unlock required.
Unfortunatly despite what the Garmin website shows, it does not have coverage of Ontario Canada lakes, 3 lakes is not what I would call coverage.

U.S. Recreational Lakes with Fishing Hot Spots is ideal for fishing, recreational boating or camping. Featuring maps of thousands of the country?s best fishing and boating destinations, it is divided into three easy-to-use geographic regions:
	East
	Central
	West

Anglers and pleasure boaters alike will appreciate the detail, selection, and easy-to-use format of these lake maps ? all at a very competitive price

Garmin has simplified the way anglers purchase and use these maps. Map detail and data may be viewed on a personal computer and then downloaded to select Garmin GPS products or purchased on pre-programmed data cards. All lakes in each region are unlocked ?making it easy to use. The CD-ROM version includes all U.S. Recreational Lakes and Fishing Hot Spots maps for each region, while the data card version offers regional Fishing Hot Spots maps only.

In addition to Fishing Hot Spots lake detail, U.S. Recreational Lakes with Fishing Hot Spots v5 CD-ROM features thousands of recreational lakes, some with more information than others. In particular, Central and Eastern regions contain extra detail, including depth contours, for many lakes throughout nine states.
