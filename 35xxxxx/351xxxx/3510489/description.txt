Monaco 2005


 Monaco is a lot of things, but above all it is small. For American minds, used to large scales, it is hard to believe a country of 1.95 sq km (0.75 sq mi) can exist. The population is around 30.000 (yes, that makes it very crowed). The

The average airport is a lot larger, that gives you some idea of the scale. To make matters worse, the available land is extremely steep, about as high as wide. But it is independent and a full member of the United Nations. It deserved its place in FS2004.

It is rare that an add-on for FS2004 adds a whole country (not COVER a whole country but actually ADDING the country to the FS2004 GOTO airport list) but we managed with this amazing product. Monaco, the second smallest country on the globe is done in amazing detail. And indeed, Monaco is smaller then some airports and it does not have an airport, but is has a very nice heliport that is one of the busiest of the all the heliports. Every hour several choppers fly to and from Nice airport to pick up the few people who can afford a house in the nicer parts of the city.

Aerosoft Monaco 2005, follows in the footsteps of Manhattan, the best selling product in our online shop. Clearly for a niche market, as there is no way to even land a Super Cub in Monaco (okay, if you?ve got floats), but if you like your choppers you will find this a very exiting scenery. With the manual and the included charts you are able to fly the complex route to Nice Airport, and we?ll even provide a nice repaint of the Robinson in the colors of the exclusive Aeroclub de Monaco. Or you could take the short trip between the heliport (in stunning detail) and the Lady Moura, one of the top ten biggest private ships ever built, which also has a large helideck. The night effects are also stunning, and because Monaco is perched on the cliffs of the Med and the lights and streets go up the mountains, the first time you fly a night approach to LNMC heliport is a very strange feeling, but a stunning sight for sure.
