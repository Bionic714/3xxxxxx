,IceMaster,2008-04-24T01:44Z,"This torrent has an incorrect name.  It is NOT the Dragon Ball series.  Name torrents correctly when uploading.

Dragon Ball
Dragon Ball Z     "
,b1indfold,2008-09-20T07:45Z,"hello guys Just finish downloading this torrent, some of the chapters are repeated Dragonball 091-120. part01 and part02 are the same episodes so as 121-150. part01 and 02, and 241-276. part01 and 02 so be aware that you are downloading repeating episodes  that is why the file is so big, you only need one of the parts quality not that very good you will need daa converter to transformer into iso"
,omgben,2008-12-04T02:07Z,"i've been downloading this for over a month and i'm not even halfway finished yet.

Pleasssseeeee seed!! I would like to watch some of this over Christmas!"
,quezicotl,2009-04-13T11:19Z,"Shut the hell up about the seeding, if it wasn't obvious enough that u wouldn't be seeing Complete anytime soon just for the fact that this idiot put a file up that is 38 Gigs, then it should have been the 4 to 43 ratio, your torrents will never be a success with these tactics."
