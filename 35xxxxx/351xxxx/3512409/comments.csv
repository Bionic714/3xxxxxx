=3"
,Sheer Productions,2007-01-08T16:19Z,"illmind197289, all you have to do is copy the FLregkey and the .dll into the fruityloops folder in: C:\Program Files\Image-Line\FL Studio 6 or wherever you installed it and then hit the FLregkey icon you just copied to the folder and let it do it's thing.

The .dll (dynamic link library) isn't an aplication, the aplication that uses it, in this case FL, opens it in runtime and runs passively to make the aplication work.

Thanks a lot for this kick ass torrent. Keep smiling! =)"
