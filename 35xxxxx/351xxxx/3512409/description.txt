As we all noticed the "JonTerp1000779" Fl Studio 6.0.8 KeyReg works no more (it will "die" soon) 
so in the name of Demonoid I present my deeply sincere (u'll never know how true !!)condolences for the whole FL Tribe and the true FL lovers around the world. 

However, the good news is ....FL Studio 6.0.8. could be revived with this registration patch...... 

Long live FL Studio lovers ....and please seed for all the FL buddies out there......
