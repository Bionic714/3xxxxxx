,mazdon,2006-09-17T18:03Z,"What a sad story.... hmmm
I can get some of these torrent to work... with a lot of trouble.... burning CD:s that doesent work, loading down diffrent programs that doesen´t work to crack this torrent...so sad, I really looked forward to get this torrents as I have a lot of friends that are nurses or working in that area.
But I can see that it will be far to complicated for them to manage this downloads.... so sad.... ;(

Anyway ulysses56, thanks for trying...best regards Maxthegun"

(it starts install program, but then it hangs)

What is wrong ?"
,saguigt380,2007-04-11T22:35Z,"For me (XP SP2, mounted with Daemon Tools 4.03HE), it works fine, with or without safedisc emulation. I've install it on 2 computers, running OK.
Thank U!"
,haroo,2007-05-20T12:53Z,"I too was having lots of trouble getting these programs to work, but i think i have found the solution.

For some reason, using daemon tools 4.08 only allowed me to run discs 2,3,4,5,8 and 9, but by installing the older version daemon tools 3.47 (this is available from the website), i was able to get the whole series working by mounting the .img/.iso file with safedisc emulation (missing files torrent is not neccessary). Hope this helps others having trouble.

also to those who dontt like the files taking up their hard drive (neither do i) just burn all the files onto one disc using nero express (so that the .iso/.img files remain as .iso/.img files) and run the programs through daemon tools directly off the disc. abit slower but saves space:)

A huge thanks to ulysses56 for these! I highly recommend these programs, they have helped me hugely with my studies as a med student"
,Alexiito,2009-02-05T17:36Z,"Hi have solved the problem!

Konvert all de sec. (knee, hip,shoulder, etc) to iso. file with poweriso! 
Extraxt them to new folder.
Then mount them with alcohol 120% (NOT the HIP, KNEE or SHOULDER!!)
And every time you would like to use one of the programs mount them with Alcohol120%

And for the KNEE, HIP and SHOULDERS mount them with Daemon tools Lite but you´ll have to set the ""emulation settings"" on ALL OPTIONS ON!! (safedisc,securom,laserrom and etc!!
and its the same there, you´ll have to mount them on daemon tools if you want to use them.

PS: the HAND program doesn´t work for me. It ask for appsetup.txt

I´ve hope I have helped you!! =D"
,jdiz0808,2010-02-21T03:37Z,"It installed, but when I open it I get a runtime error 216 and then ""Access violation at 00000000. Read of address 00000000"" Any solutions?"
,morphirr,2012-03-10T13:48Z,"Couldn't get this to work in Win7 but after a lot   hassle, I used a VMware Image of Windows XP, and reading from another thread of these Cd's I used Daemon Tools 3.47
http://www.filehippo.com/download_daemon_tools/236/

Def seems to work ok in Windows XP
Thx ulysses56, but please use ISO format for any other uploads, it makes life so much easier
