This game is dead and unsupported, since the company that brought it to life is dead.
Enjoy this, but if you can buy it anywhere, then do so, like I did back in 2003 and delete this release!

1.Install the game.
2.Goto $InstallDirectory$\system\ and replace MobileForces.exe file here.
3.Play the best PC-game ever made.
4.Take a look at www.MobileForces.tk for news on my remake. C ya! ;)

And don't forget my remake that starts this fall!

C ya!
