,cronos12,2007-02-24T07:59Z,Im having the same problem.  After entering serial code and click on the registration button the program jams (!?)
,Jo Mama,2007-03-10T02:22Z,"Hey fellas, same problem for me, but read around the site and found good instructions from David-7237. NOTE : you must have OllyDbg.exe , which you can get from http://ollydbg.de/. This program does stuff to the dumpserial exe

1-Run ollydbg from the archieve...

2-go to File-->Open and browse for dumpserial.exe...wait till it finishes analysing

3-press the blue triangle(looks like the Play button in the recorder)

4-now it should start.. and a window pops up(the dumpserial)

5-type any NAME in the box below(not the 2 boxes above) and press the button below it

6-go back to ollybdg(if it didn't get back by itself) and press that triangle again.

7-now in ollybdg.. you see 3 boxes with 3 scroll bars each.. look at the thrid one to the right(the box)

8-scroll up slowly you will see you NAME that you entered in the box in dumpserial, right?.. ok

9-scroll up slowly.. and look for UNICODE.. right next to it is the serial for you...

it looks like this:

EJFOJMKPFJIOMQOOINELCNGIMANIOOHG

don't forget to save the Serial you got for a future use... you won't need ollydbg anymore.."
,A330-300,2007-09-30T13:00Z,yea this method works untill u get up to the point where u actually put ur code in... the program rc4.exe ends up not responding and subsequently self closes without registering!
,Mister_Toine,2008-01-04T14:36Z,"This doesn't work for me.

4-now it should start.. and a window pops up(the dumpserial)

Nothing starts or pops up here :(
Please help me! "
,Mister_Toine,2008-01-04T14:55Z,"When I press that 'play' button, I got an error in the left hand corner:

Access violation when writing to [00000010]
Help me plz!"
