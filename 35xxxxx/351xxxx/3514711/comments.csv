,vinhalo,2006-08-25T03:27Z,"An observation rather than a dig, but why does everyone in the film have really bad teeth?"
,theBruce,2006-08-25T09:57Z,Vin halo> Because these guys have sacrificed thier odontological health so that we all can download files for free. Ain't that something?

U hypocrate! U think u can both have the cookie AND eat it? Check  witch torrents has the most users. Do u think there would be so many ppl using filesharing at all if they removed the most popular section?"
,vinhalo,2006-08-25T12:25Z,theBruce - (Robert?) That is indeed something I greatly appreciate from the PirateBay team.  But it seems members of the public interviewed in the movie share the same dental affliction...  Just wondered what the dental care system was like in Sweden.
,kelken,2006-08-25T13:28Z,LOSER..... THIS MOViE SUCK!!!
,drskill,2006-08-25T16:33Z,"First of all, fuck you. You are the scum of this Earth.
Why, you ask?
You try to argue on the Basis of ""Free Decision of the Individual"". Yet, in your Movie you include subliminal Messages to corrupt the natural Process of forming an Opinion by including minutest Messages for a few frames only. This Technique is known for Dekades to meddle with Viewers Opinions (e.g. in Commercials). These Messages may be pro-Piracy, but they show that you give a fuck about OUR Opinions and want to make us Slaves to Yours. In this Aspect, you are no better than the Industry.
Thus, fuck you.
Nice Movie btw."
,Inquisitor1,2006-08-25T21:55Z,"So you would rather be a slave for a few people who want to take everything from you or the huge filesharing community that gives and instead of taking, makes copies? :)"

IT'S WRONG!!!!! "
,Parasitetwin,2006-09-27T00:10Z,"I agree with HallamBerg, could you remove the subliminial messages? They're damn annoying, just make 'em show a longer time and I'll probably contribute with (unfortunately) a lesser sum."

,realblades,2006-12-19T20:42Z,No codec info. Not taking chances since people mention the subliminal messages. At the very least that kind of thing is guaranteed to work in one way. Anooyance.

Anyhoo ....

Good film! ""Steal this film"" er myke bedre en ""Steal this movie"", which sounds lame

And about the money argument (the ""boohoo we're all gonna be poor coz of Piratbyran""-thing): I just wanna say this: the studios are making HUGE amounts of money on these films, they can afford to pay stupid people like Tom Cruise not 20 million dollars but 100 million dollars per movie!!!! Let all the scriptgirls, moviecutters, coffeepeople, securitypeople get their money there first before coming cry-babying to us about piracy!

If that industry can lose 18 billion dollars (if you believe them) and is still around, then obviously their complaints are not about their survival but about Valenti's second cousins third yacht .... all fifteen of his cousins!

And firing 250 people from the studios and then complain to us that it is coz of piracy and coz of the 20 million dollars they pay Stallone, Jim Carrey, Cameron Diaz etc. .... it's beyond me. And its HYPOCRITICAL. And it's also time to give back. So much money and power in the hands of a few people (Americans at that .... ;) ) It's no good, and I'm VERY glad that the Piratebay is doing something back."

,-T2k-,2007-09-24T15:36Z,"Nice geek story, OK editing (for an amateur movie) but HORRIBLE CRAP CAMERA WORK - nobody noticed Rsms is OUT OF FOCUS? What kind of idiot handled the cam there? The stupid project he lives in was sharp (well, rather just the sharpest) while his face was totally blurry...  made those segments unwatchable. I wonder WTF the editor thought... is this some kind of stupid joke? If so it's really lame - if not, it's downright pathetic."
,-T2k-,2007-09-24T15:56Z,"PS: This TiAMO guy should not be allowed on front of the camera - his ENglish is HORRIBLE, he barely scratches the level of a 10-ys old English speaker - he barely can formulate a cohesive thought, even less a coherent sentence (he speaks with words only, without any actual sentence formed) and if this and his obvious errors wouldn't be enough to turn you off, his high pitched, singing-styled voice will surely make you stop watching the movie or at least skip him ASAP."

For all those that are complaining about this film, you are all forgetting what pirating is about and what filesharing is all about.

,chatmaster,2009-01-22T01:13Z,"I love filesharing but lets consider the con's.  

Imagine yourself working on a software for a couple of years.  Your intent is to sell 1000 pcs. to compensate for the time you spent on it.  Now, I buy one and share it with my fellow members.  Out of 10 million people there are 999 that the software was meant for.  You don't sell the 999 needed.  Wouldn't you be pissed?

I am one of these people in my example.  Only thing I never did is sell it through the internet, probably the reason why I never sold more than 23."
,fenzel,2009-01-22T20:48Z,"chatmaster, sharing your product freely online increases public awareness and interest.. it shows the internet that you aren't scared of distributing things in new ways, as well as showing us that you care about the consumer and your product enough to share it in its entirety.

the more people who know about and have used it (and are happy with it), the more people are likely to purchase it ""legally""... and better than that, you will be ""on their radar"" for quite some time... any future releases will be much more appealing than if you had not pirated your own material."
