A comedy set in a brothel run by a chain-smoking granny who's seen it all. Unhappily-married Michael's middle-class existence slowly unravels when he falls for the adorable prostitute Hayley. To maintain his double life Michael requires cunning and subterfuge, neither of which he is blessed with.

Michael, a middle-aged henpecked husband nervously visits The Debonnaire and pays for half an hour with the very dim but pretty Hayley. He doesn't get any further than stripping down to his underpants, however is so happy to have found someone who seems to like him that he soon finds himself falling in love with Hayley and starts making regular visits to the brothel behind his wife's back so they can chat more.

The Debonnaire is run by Maureen, a no-nonsense 27 year old (well plus a few years). Also at the Debonnaire is 'maid' Naomi, the intimidating Yelena and Kate, a clever girl who's looking to subsidise her academic career. Rather awkwardly for Michael it turns out Barry, a builder he and his wife are employing to decorate their house, is one of the brothel's best customers.
