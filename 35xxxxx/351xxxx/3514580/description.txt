The Papal Chase is a feature-length guerrilla documentary that captures one man's obsession to meet the Pope in order to win a bet. The Pope is visiting Canada and Kenny Hotz's friend has bet him $1,000 that he can't meet 'his holiness'. Kenny is a maniac, a non-believer, totally lacking any form of spirituality, he is overly determined to win the cash, but he has only six days to redeem himself. In his attempt to meet 'the most heavily guarded man in the world' Kenny becomes a Pope-arazzi, fighting his way through millions of pilgrims and onlookers, thousands of cops, security guards, Vatican Special Forces, precision snipers, the media and 2 million religious zealots.
 
Over the 6-day period, Kenny becomes slightly catholicised, beginning to search not only for the Pope, but an understanding of God. His religious quest is a fascinating glimpse into contemporary global faith and Papal celebrity. Hotz's irreverent, often confrontational style explores the limits of personal freedom and expression at the highly secure, international festival.
 
Armed with a fake press card, Kenny has undertaken a task of biblical proportions. Is it possible for some obsessed non-believer to meet the Pope?
