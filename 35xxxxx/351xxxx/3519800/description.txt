KateOS 3.0 LIVE is the newest version of our distribution which boots directly from the CD. It is a great demonstration of our system's possibilities. It can also come very handy when trying to rescue another system. The CD contains 2GB of compressed data, including the Xfce environment with multimedia and office applications. Also available are system and partition rescue tools, Gparted (partitioning tool) and Clamav, an antivirus scanner. All these tools are priceless during a data rescue session after a system crash. The LIVE version automatically detects and configures all available hardware, which gets you a fully functional system in just a few minutes. KateOS 3.0 LIVE includes all updates available so far for the 3.0 version.
