,suprhero,2008-01-30T05:38Z,Amazing documentary. must see if you like fighting and have a brain
,t1nuSK4,2008-03-31T15:00Z,"Ad torrent: Flawless video & audio

Ad movie: Interesting and amusing, but some of the conclusions that the ""scientists"" arrive to must be taken with reserve. After all, they test only one speciman from every sport. So claims such as ""kung fu is the fastest"" or ""tae kwon do has best reaction times"" are a little stretch, based on comparison between two people. However, the documentary is still fun to watch. I recommend to all martial arts fans."
,taxim99,2008-05-21T22:10Z,thanks so much for this one.  i saw this a long time ago and its awesome to be able to find it here.  i'll be seeding this one for a long time. i just hope it has the weapons as well as the hand to hand combat.
,MyUserName0027,2008-06-13T09:34Z,"Good torrent.
Thanks, will seed so long as computer is on.


(Like what others have said, don't apply everything these people say though, because they are only basing everything off of one person from each martial art to represent a whole.)"

,dragorin1000,2011-02-13T04:12Z,"the show's test are done terribly they have no kind of control at all.ofc the sm,allest guy has the weakest punch and the biggest guy will have the strongest"
,dragorin1000,2011-02-13T04:13Z,"oh yeah also, the kung fu guy is a wushu practitioner, wushu is not really martial arts. its all about competition not fighting"
