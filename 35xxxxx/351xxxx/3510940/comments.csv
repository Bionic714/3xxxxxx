IÂ´d like to get rid of the subtitles when suing english audio, is there a way to do that, the menu did not give me any option...
Polanski and Hajime rules!"

,barton101,2012-08-14T09:36Z,"Next time, please include English subtitles for the hearing impaired. They are also good for people who don't have English as their first language. Subtitles take up hardly any extra space and they make for more seeders because the torrent is useful to more people."
