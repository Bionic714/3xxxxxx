I seem to remember them being pretty decent sized then....course I guess that was pretty decent sized at the time, but they were bigger then 1.44 floppies I believe. and now all three are just slightly bigger than one? hm."

Bard's Tale!  -whoa!- Flashbacks of 300 baud manual modems,
FastLoad cartidges, instant-on! &  the SID chip!  Ahhh, those were the days.

psst Bamimi:

It's quite the opposite.

A formatted C64 1541 floppy had 168,656 bytes of storage capacity (170kb!)

Today's 1.44mb floppy, has a formatted capacity of 1,457,664 bytes (1.38mb)

pwnt!  Almost 10 times over, so- 1.79mb is a very realistic amount for the 

Bard's Tales 3-Disk set.
