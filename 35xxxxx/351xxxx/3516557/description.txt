"The vibe of Eye of Ra goes from instrumental stoner rock grooves to thrash charges to foot tapping jams to doom ballads, covering the whole gamet. This album is a frenzy with a riff rarely ever repeated within a song. Constantly in the red, abrasive production and forceful tunes really push the threshold."
