,LuNk4n,2006-08-21T20:58Z,"I really works, no need to install. Strange!
Did you install the game on your computer and then made a torrent off all the files?"
[T],DasBot,2006-11-26T08:22Z,Too short to be the real thing!
,marpe771,2006-12-09T15:41Z,"Fake? 
Chessmaster 10th comes in three CD, and itÂ´s a heavy program. I donÂ´t think this torrent is the real thing."
,Norwegianange,2007-07-14T19:28Z,"Wow! This really workd, without installation without anything... just unpack and start playing. Thanks for the game..."
,RaiRai_7,2007-07-29T13:31Z,Yeah! Worked fine for me too! Starting animations and tutorials (they contain a lot of speech) have been ripped. Game and puzzles are working great! Thanks andjamsaw2!
,hmp7,2007-08-09T12:22Z,"its small cause its just the game, the learning-part is gone!"

,peeta,2008-03-01T14:04Z,work great. How can i change the language
,nipitiri2,2008-04-23T09:15Z,"Ok i rarely comment, but this one deserves it. It works, no install no crack. I was looking for just a small sized powerfull chess game, and what's more powerfull than chessmaster?
Some things ask for CDs like the ""Natrural Language Advice"", but even that when i click cancel it still works! so in conclusion this game has all what you need, stripped from the shitload of additions that come with the full version."
,scorpio_india69,2008-05-23T09:22Z,"This is a real thing. A very Nice Upload.

,blombardo,2010-01-22T21:31Z,"I confirm that on XP sp3 - Chessmaster.exe and game.exe both cause an Application error.
""the instructoin at ""0x0049d9de"" referenced memory at ""0xeefa3d80"". The memory could not be ""read"".

therefore - this torrent is NOT good anymore; at least for those of us on XPsp3"
,solamande,2010-04-09T16:57Z,Thank you very much for this. It's perfect for (and works great on) my laptop.
,vicfreeworld,2010-08-07T08:45Z,"This works. Its the real thing. I have chessmaster 10th installed on a desktop, but had lost the CDs. So this helped immensely since I wanted to set it up on a laptop... Thanks!"
,tpb2009Nov13jb,2011-11-04T21:14Z,Thanks! It works fine on Windows XP Home SP3 as a portable app. Unpack the .rar then make a shortcut to the .exe file and you're all set to go! Installation-serial-crack not required. 
,amzbhagat,2012-01-06T15:30Z,"Awesum DOwnload!! Very lucid, compressed version Game working very well! Thanks Mate. Great JOb!!"
