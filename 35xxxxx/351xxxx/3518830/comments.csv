,danbethrach,2006-09-06T14:50Z,"I've downlaoded this twice and the MP3 files don't work, either in my burner or through my various player programs, like Windows Media Player, etc. Is anyone else having this problem? Have you identified a solution? I'm open to any advice you can offer. You can e-mail me at dmccue@charlestonbusiness.com.

Thank you!"

IÂ´ve downloaded this torrent also and it includes couple dozens of clips from movie ""Apocalypse Now"" ???
For purpose, or else???
David Johansen and Swaheto Woman makes your day better :-
Perhaps SwePelleTelia has made mistakes with buttons :-)
We wait real David Johansen.... ;-) "
,bba221,2006-09-16T20:48Z,"This torrent does NOT contain any music of David Johansen whatsoever, but instead various video clips ( with the wrong file extensions ).

Please remove it!"
,Napoleon666,2006-10-05T18:48Z,Seed plz
,Alltattooed,2007-03-04T19:05Z,"DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!!
Stupidly I decided to take a chance and download this in spite of the warnings, well there's NO David Johansen, only short seconds of film music."
,halcro,2007-03-31T18:17Z,This does not work. Please rip it in another program and reseed. This is fantastic record that I have been searching for for years!!!
,sigany,2007-07-12T14:09Z,"BAN THIS GUY FOR LIFE! 
Every upload from him (and there's a lot) is a fake! Don't download anything from him"
