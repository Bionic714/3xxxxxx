,zver999,2006-08-11T21:08Z,jag fattar inte varför i hela kukens namn reenkodar man DVDn från MPEG2 till MPEG2?! kvaliten suger ju efter... XVID har fan bättre kvalitet och tar 10000 mindre bandbredden... jävla idioter rippa VOBbar istället!
,Wetbones,2006-08-11T21:22Z,Looks good. I'll download this to tide me over until the inevitable extended super uncut unrated director's cut comes out.

From NFO:
------------
Notes: CuriousJotos had reencoded menu that causesÛÛ   Û²        freezing on standalones, and nonworking menu² ÜÛÛß   for some. ÛÛÞß     ÞÛÝ     we could rls a ifo patch, but to be honest, ""reencoded menu""ÞÛ and stripped IFOs, and a made up bitrate from a calculaterÞÛ looks more like a one click program. ÞÛÞÛ      so we propered. enjoy. for those who say ""yea but one-click isÞÛ ok"". one click is ok for your personal archive or maybe for classicsÞÛ but not for pre. pre is a race that should be fair for all based onÞÛ rules we all agreed on. without following those rules, you are justÞÛ savages. we and another group could have one clicked this rls as wellÞÛ and had this out way early, but thats not fun. stop ruining the sceneÞÛ with going for fame. the rules and the scene were here before youÞÛ were scooped up from the newsgroups. please leave if you dont likeÞÛ it. To the jotos out there, everyone gets caught not using CCE, evenÞÛ us. so dont get mad, get better. we hope to see on the battlefieldÞÛ again. we hope you arent a puppet grp just testing your src with aÞÛ clever name. it would be nice to see more good rlses from people whoÞÛ have the src to do so.ÞÛÞÛ  p.s. this rls only came with eng subs. check amazon if you jest.ÞÛ       enjoy."
,Son Of Mogh,2006-08-11T22:09Z,"It would be nice than if you would up the proper, wouldn't it, instead of just telling us."
,zombiezombie,2006-08-11T22:56Z,"well fukkers, this is a great movie and a very nice transfer!! Looks fukking great on my Panasonic ptae 900 projector."
,psykopat,2006-08-11T23:23Z,Or simply run the iso in DVD Shrink and remove the damn menus. i hate them anyway.
,spanx,2006-08-12T00:19Z,kan ingen fixa swedish subs ?
,andyfox01,2006-08-12T00:52Z,"yiuloan is the man,i've downloaded/seeded a few of his uploads without any problems.
