i had to put it into a rar file because it had too many files as one folder for bitcomet to create the torrent.
 plus, i dont know how to make those rar's where its a bunch of little rar's that all connect

common people!!"
,syntaxxx,2006-12-01T17:33Z,SEED!??
,TheSilencer,2006-12-14T17:50Z,"If you two who have 100% of this torrents just puts it on high priority so that I can get the last 7% I will dedicate it 200K/s in upload for a long time.

That would be great for the rest of the leechers.

Great torrent, but very slow swarm.


And I can confirm that this seems to be the real deal. Disk one contains the keygen from H2O. :)"
,Reveirg,2007-01-04T20:46Z,"Is this a self-install?
Or will I have to burn it on a DVD before? (I don't have a DVD on my PC)"
,furrimunki,2007-03-01T09:57Z,please re-seed! I'm stuck on 18% with 0% health and no connected seeds or peers :-(
,m2thedeep,2007-05-31T23:40Z,"you know what's great? when you're the only one who uploads on a torrent using all of your upload bandwidth and you can't even get a speed of higher than 0.1kbps. im at 82 percent so if someone wants to see while i finish, ill be happy to reseed."

,BigMike_Quebec,2010-03-23T06:21Z,"Can someone please hook me up with a Keygen download or an activation key + serial # please? I tried to download this torrent but it said it wasn't completed because of a virus(Obviously the keygen - But it's not a virus they just think keygens are) So I don't want to have to re-download 3gbs just for a keygen. 

Thanks in advance! "
