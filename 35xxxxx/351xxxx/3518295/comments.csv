,Kallic,2006-09-03T00:35Z,"I think you guys are just freakin out about the ""virus"" thing.  From what I recall, alot of people said they had ""viruses"" from the demo version too.  It's just your scanner reading a file wrong.

It's like with AVG Free Edition virus scanner, java gave me 3 ""viruses"" ..  But obviously the 3 files aren't actually viruses, they're java files, and the scanner just read em wrong, don't worry about it.

I'm having trouble, though.  Like everyone seems to be doing, I mount the image with Daemon Tools (newest version), install it, and then open the .exe with the Securom loader.  I get an error message telling me to use the original disk instead of a copy.  

Does anyone know what to do to counteract this?  If not, can those who got it to work tell us some specifics (i.e. did you mount it with all options on?)?

,Bangelore,2006-09-03T14:24Z,"Maybe I got a bright idea! 

Using DT4 and secuROM loader didn't work for me when loading the .mdf file in DT4. I think that the problem is caused by the fact that there is no .mds file, so I made one by making a new image using the 'make image wizard' in al120. Then I loaded the .mds file in DT4 (all emulations off) and used secuROM loader to start the game. et voila! Now it works!!"

Re; game. This game is fantastic. great storyline and amazing voice acting. I havent been this into a game storyline since HL2. First chapter of the game is strictly stealth so don't get impatient, just let the story unfold. It alternates between characters so theres plenty of gunplay. Note, the medium difficulty feels ""just right"" its challenging but not frustrating. good stuff."

First of all try Pr0tst0p, I´m actually not sure anymore if I hid the device when i finally got it working but anyhow, just to be sure.

But then don´t listen to all comments above, just ENable the Securom Emulation in your daemontools menue and run securom loader from a directory other than your CoJ Game directory(try Pr0tst0p before, but as I said - not sure if needed)!

This should do the trick, worked perfectly for me :)

,@vi@tor,2006-09-12T14:29Z,"Well i don't think Win32 modification is the actual virus, what it does is download other files to your hd.
When installed all of a sudden i got some malware and spyware on the hd, in my win/win32 directory there was this file: srshost.exe all of a sudden, which wasn't there before installation. Norton just found it in my win directory after installation of the game, maybe you should keep an eye on that one."
