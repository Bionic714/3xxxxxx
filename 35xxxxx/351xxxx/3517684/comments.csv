,swamp33,2008-02-22T08:11Z,"I hope my search for The Bootleg Series 7 (The No Direction Home Soundtrack) ends here.

I was surprised and quite sad how hard it was to find living Dylan torrents out there.

I normally seed 2:1 whatever I get but this one, if it comes down, I might have to open up unlimited ratio for a while.  There's too much talent here and not enough availability.

Bless Bob Dylan and bless TPB."
