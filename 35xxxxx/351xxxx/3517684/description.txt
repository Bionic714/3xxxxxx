Since I cant seed my old torrent of this and since it seems to be badly seeded these days, I decided to up my Dylan albums again. New additions are: Modern Times, The Bootleg Series 7 and Bob Dylan and The Times They Are A-Changin' in their new remastered editions (released as an afterthought to the Reissues Series). Apart from that, all the Reissues are included (except Love&Theft which I decided I didnt need). John Wesley Harding is in both editions because the reissue of it was so critized - judge for yourself. Various duplicates on compilation albums have been deleted - all official albums are of course complete. 

Most are in mp4, a few is in mp3 meaning I got it from here, mostly. I have encoded using Nero Digital AAC @ 250-300 kbps (Reissues @ 448 kbps). Maybe youll need a plugin, but they are easy to come by (get dbpoweramp, for example). Enjoy.
