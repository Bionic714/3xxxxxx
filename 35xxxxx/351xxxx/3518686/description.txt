I patched this myself, using the default.xbe file from my UK PAL retail copy of the game. Now the file is patched to NTSC and so plays on my Japanese NTSC xbox from the hdd. This should work for most people who have tried everything but can't get the game to load from the hdd. Enjoy.
P.s. this is my first torrent, and my connection speed is slow, so bear with me.
