!Description!
This is a rip of a Magellan Roadmate 300 regional card.  This card has detailed regional maps of the United States Eastern region (basically all eastern states from Florida to Maine that touch the coast of the Atlantic).  This fits on a 512mb SD card.

!IMPORTANT!
I do not know if you need all of the files on the card- Some of the files appear to be Magellan Operating system files.  I can't test this theory since I only have one card.  Also you may need to certify/activate/authorize/whatever your 512mb SD card on the magellan webpage before you copy over the files (this is free).  This may add a couple files onto the card; I don't know, I have not tried it.

!NOTE!
I assume no risk if you make a brick out of your GPS.  Be careful and make a backup of all your files!

If anyone has other regional cards for their Magellan 300 please upload them; I only have Eastern.
