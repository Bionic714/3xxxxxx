,dj245245,2007-01-30T05:10Z,"Yes I will, but the original torrent I lost so I will have to recreate it.  I can't simply reupload because I was an idiot and rar'd it and did not include the rar options in the comments

Then I deleted the rar file after it was fully seeded and forgot about it.  whoops!  Should be up by Wendsday 31-01-07 at the very latest
