,Momijigari,2006-09-04T03:30Z,"Thank you.
But by ""ratio 2 : 1"", I do hope you mean that you will seed until there are other seeders - so far the average completion is around 24%, and I have only seen a seeder (you) for brief moments.

As for seeding, as long as you seed until at least some of us has 100% I doubt seeding will be a problem... for instance, so far I have managed to download 70 MB, and uploaded 690 MB (about 50 MB was uploaded just while writing this). So *my* ratio is already more than 10 : 1 :/"
,Momijigari,2006-09-04T20:07Z,"Now that I read e.meduza's comment, I tried listening to some of the songs that I have 100% of... and there is no sound. I tried several apps, and no sound in any of them. Is this torrent a hoax??
Gee thanks... I am really glad to have uploaded 2.47 GB - NOT!!!

BTW: it's not even six albums, as the info says. One of the folders contains only the cover art, and no songs."

The file was just clips of the movie ""Apocalypse Now"" For anyone thinking of downloading this file STOP NOW this shithead who submitted the file lied to you. p.s. The reason it won't play is because it's a video file which works when playing with Windows Media Player. There are some real pricks in the community and this submitter is one of them."

,FrankSpank,2007-12-10T01:04Z,"Ummm yeah, I have Apocalypse Now on DVD, don't really need fake MP3's with bits of the movie in it.

Maybe it's really Diamond Dave behind this and he doesn't like his music stolen, LOL

Come on Dave, you don't have to be mad, everyone knows you are much better than Sammy Hagar."
