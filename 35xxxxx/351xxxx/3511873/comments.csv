,LeRoiCR,2007-07-11T20:24Z,"For all those who are wanting to download this in hopes it will work; do yourself a favor and don't.  It is my fault; It's broken due to me not testing it properly and removing bugs in it.  I meant well, and will probably get around to fixing it.  But in the meantime, this download is broken!!!!   Sorry folks!!!!  And by the way, my Morrowind All In One is not broken.  It works perfectly, that is if one follows directions perfectly."
