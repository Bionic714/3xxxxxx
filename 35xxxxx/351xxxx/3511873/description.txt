Here is a Patch for Windows XP - Windows Genuine Advantage.  a.k.a. (The "Un"-Official Windows Genuine Advantage "Hot"-Fix)  This puppy allows for You to Disable/Install Windows Genuine Advantage Easily.  You will want to Disable "WGA" so as to gain RAM back and for less Spyware "WGA" running in the background.  You will want to Install WGA if the Auto Update Client fails to download any new Windows XP Updates.  Hence it's like a Windows XP Auto Update Client Enabler.  It has a nice interface which I built myself.  This is pretty much the same as "How to disable or uninstall the pilot version of Microsoft Windows Genuine Advantage Notifications".  Which can be found at http://support.microsoft.com/kb/921914.  Mine's better though, cuz it does a lot of it for you, and Fast.

Here are two reminders, please read the nfo with notepad, and here is the link to the picture I made of it, so you can check it out a little, and obviously it's not the same thing as any of the other WGA Patches you see out there available.

It's a whole lot better looking and Absolutely Clean in Every Manner of Malicious Code compared to them.  Although they did give me an idea to start work on one.  I'll be releasing others available here and on other torrent sites.

Hope you like the quality and handiness of this Patch.
