,sgu,2006-09-03T13:03Z,Is this version in anyway different from the 930MB one uploaded previously? Thanks
,mspider,2006-09-04T10:59Z,After downloading Final Cut Studio 5  (979.3MB)the installation program asks for Installation discs.                                                           Any way around this?   thanks
,Bixxx,2006-09-20T23:55Z,"Hmm, I can't install anything but the actual ""Final Cut Pro"". If i choose any other alternatives from the install menu I get requests for other CD's... is this as it should be? Or have you guys managed to get around this somehow..? Please let me know!
=)"
[V],Andy^^,2006-09-21T11:26Z,"Final Cut Studio is about 30 GB , then you have it all ... This is only Final Cut Pro.. You are missing some cd's , like Motion"
,Bixxx,2006-09-21T13:37Z,"Hehe, thanks Andy.
;-)

Then I know."
,gmacman,2006-10-12T22:03Z,"Does this have the universal build for ALL of Final Cut Studio?  Or is it just the UB of FCP?  

That's been floating around for awhile but the rest of the UB (DVDSP, etc.) is no where to be found."
,gmacman,2006-10-16T18:43Z,Found an answer to my own question.  The rest of the UBs are available on demonoid
,Computerchief,2006-10-28T16:10Z,Does this work well on my Powerbook (PPC)? I hope i can work with full speed even thought this is the ub build of fcs.
,spinkfuzz,2006-12-16T20:49Z,"THIS IS FINAL CUT PRO ONLY, IT IS _NOT_ FINAL CUT STUDIO. This will work with PPC or Intel. Others have commented on this, and this is the final word."
,jarandm,2007-01-11T20:49Z,"I have had problems with other Intel final cut downloads (Uiversal binary). When its innstalled and i try to run the application, it bounce one time in the dock, and dissapears.. The program dont starts.. Have someone noticed something simular on this torrent?"
,OutlawJoe,2007-01-21T14:09Z,Dise anyone have a serial number?

,knvb1123,2007-04-24T06:14Z,The whole Final Cut Studio should be 30GB.
,jandk,2007-07-13T19:35Z,"You can install Final Cut Pro, Livetype (NOT Livetype Media), Cinema Tools, Compressor.

Nothing Else!

Works fine with the serial provided by geekgood"
,shadowcorp707,2007-07-21T07:32Z,"I used that serial (and others I've found) FCP installs, but when I open the application and have to put in the serial again this box comes up.

""LICENSING ERROR

This application cannot continue because the licensing data is corrupt.""

damn"
,indesignimage,2007-07-23T16:45Z,"this is just final cut pro only,  Final Cut Studio is about 30G"
,shadowcorp707,2007-07-25T11:03Z,"yes indesign, this has been said numerous times above already. 

To repeat, when I ONLY try to install final cut and use that serial above (and others I've found) FCP installs, but when I open the application and have to put in the name/serial again this box comes up.

""LICENSING ERROR"" This application cannot continue because the licensing data is corrupt.""

does anyone else have this problem?
I'm running a G4 PPC laptop"
,leboundesign,2007-09-20T15:56Z,"I have the same problem!
when I put D-342-VPT-206-QGO-363-YDV-134-RXN-STP
as first sn, it works, then he asks me the others (DVD sp3, FCP HD, Motion) and I can't get any anywhere!!
Pleease heeelp!"
,Garrison628,2007-11-01T04:46Z,SEED! Please! I'm at 89.8%... i really gotta get this thing!
,cstyle83,2008-03-07T16:38Z,"i downloaded and everything works fine, it never asked me for a serial number, maybe because I already have express.  BUT none of my filters work from the video effects section, I can work with scale and rotation but nothing else, no solarize or anything.  Does anyone know what to do??
Thanks for all this, really great to find things on here!"
