,Da King,2006-09-05T21:10Z,"@ Son of Mog: http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3519306/Star_Trek_DS9_S7D3 of course I read them. I was simply asking Lord Bender-C why he was loosing his internet connection and giving a bit of a gig towards this fact. these days, one should not loose an internet connection! What say you?!?! 

Lord Bender-C, hope to see you back online ASAP. I applause you."
,bender-c,2006-09-05T21:51Z,"Im loosing my connection because im moving with my family to our brand new house and currently we dont even have a phoneline there, but it will be installed begining of next week. But i wont have much time over, me and my fiancĂŠ had our first child the 14th of august, a beautiful little baby girl, and now she is far more important then any star trek, internetwhatever or anything else to me, but i promised you the last season so i'll put them up before moving and then im out of here :-)"
