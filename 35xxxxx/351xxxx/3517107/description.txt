With her first studio recording in six years, Miriam Makeba makes a remarkably rootsy return, celebrating both South Africa and her place in it. Both "Masakhane" and a reworking of her international hit from the '60s ("Pata Pata 2000") positively shimmer with loping South African rhythms and harmonies. But Makeba is also an accomplished ballad and jazz singer, and both of those facets are shown, in songs like "Amaliya" and "Unhome," where the piano work recalls the township jazz of people like Abdullah Ibrahim and Chris MacGregor. Makeba's voice has acquired a compassion and even greater control as she's grown older, but she never sounds old--in fact, there's an incredible energy about this record. While every track is a joy, the real highlights come when the rootsy elements are emphasized and things simply kick. If you thought Graceland or Ladysmith Black Mambazo encapsulated the sound of South Africa, take a listen to this--the country's queen of song has returned in full voice.
