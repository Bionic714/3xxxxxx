,Jannez,2006-08-13T13:23Z,"musicMATCH Jukebox är en spelare som jag ser mer som ett virus. Kan man göra denna låt till ett sundare format? 
cool upload, visste inte att låten fanns ;-)

,olav66,2006-08-13T14:47Z,"Hi Jannez,

Been using MMJ since the late nineties and it has never failed me and never showed any syptoms of any virus... BUT I use the 1998 (6.10.0165 version), which is quite 'old'. I've always shyed away from the newer releases because... well, of what you said. If you'd like this version I could ""yousendit"" out to you..?"
,alcocops,2006-08-14T00:16Z,"Hi Olav. It won't play in my MMJ 7.5. The Media Player won't support it either, though it usually plays MP3s in my experience. If it had been uploaded by anyone but you I would have suspected a hoax."

's been a long time; how r u doing?
Did you succeed well on DIME? I think I never saw you aroubd there..?"
,kukenIstyret,2006-08-19T14:59Z,"Whats the use of uploading an mp3 that won't play on ordinary players?!?
Is there anything one can do to hear it without instaling some obscure, old musicMATCH Jukebox?"
