The GPP-1 is a high quality soft-limiter / peak compressor designed for peak-
taming / compression during real-time tracking, sub-tracking and mixing, live or
in the studio. It can compress troublesome peaks, soften the sound, and bring
out instruments that would have been buried in the final mix. It offers five
different release types designed for different material and taste. Program
dependent envelope times for increased loudness and minimum pumping are also
included.
