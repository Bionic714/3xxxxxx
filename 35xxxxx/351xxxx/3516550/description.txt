Discovery Civilisation - Famous Diamonds

The world's most famous gem has graced the presence of emperors, kings and commoners alike. It survived a revolution and was the prized bounty in one of history's boldest and most bizarre thefts. This visually compelling one-hour documentary explores the legendary 45-and-a-half carat Hope Diamond, from its roots in 1600s India to its journey to America at the turn of the 20th century. The film debunks many of the myths surrounding the Hope Diamond, and explores the cursed legacy of this mysterious and intriguing jewel. The world's largest blue diamond was filmed under tight security at its home in the Smithsonian Institute.
