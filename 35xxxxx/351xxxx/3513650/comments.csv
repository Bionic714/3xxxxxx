Often their servers are broken tho, which actually is not so bad. it saves you a lot of time as trying to make a net install of a huge OS like Suse from broken servers will leave you feeling very pissed off. Try another distro made by people who actually give a shit about their users enough to maintain their servers.  If you want a faster download than bt and not get a corrupted file then get it from the maker's fast ftp server and download uninterrupted. 

stalkerPL  if you want to make a release you actually have to make the *file* available, not only the torrent link. "
