,codecoptor,2007-01-14T02:07Z,"but still, thanks for sharing ulysses56. And to anybody reading, this CD has some awesome tracks. For example ""soy como soy"" (which is mis-named in this torrent)"
,sleslie23,2009-04-19T09:10Z,"In addition to the problems codecopter mentions, this torrent is missing track 2 of the CD. It took longer to rename the tracks than it did to download.

Still, there are some amazing songs on this CD."

Thanks again for uploading these Ulysses."
