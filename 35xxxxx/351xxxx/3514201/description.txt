Putumayo Records Presents:
Colombia 2001
Upbeat, danceable music from the country that inspired the Putumayo name.  
Rip 192kbs
Covers Included

Named after a beautiful Colombian river valley, Putumayo returns to its roots with a fun and danceable collection of cumbia, vallenato, porro and salsa. Colombia plays an important role in Putumayo's history, as company founder Dan Storper was inspired to name his original clothing and handcrafts company after the stunning Putumayo River valley he visited in 1974. 
The music of Colombia has yet to make an international splash like Cuban music has in recent years, but everyone who is familiar with Latin America's third largest country knows that it is likely to be the source of the next big thing in Latin music. Fans of the straight-to-the-bone grooves of Cuban music will find the music of Colombia equally entrancing and soulful. 
Discover the instantly engaging music of Colombia with this fun, accessible collection of music that will light up any fiesta. The extensive liner notes are in English and Spanish, and the 32-page booklet features artist photos as well as beautiful images of Colombia.
