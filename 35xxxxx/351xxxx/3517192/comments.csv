,meneguzzi,2007-06-27T19:39Z,"This documentary is not even close to being scientific in any way.

The analogies made by the director to justify the huge leaps of reasoning he makes could only convince a 10-year old. For instance, he states that if someone went to look for evidence about WW2 and thought it happened 100 years in the future or past, he would not find it (or something along those lines).

The thing he absolutely disregards is that societies that had calendar systems (like the Egyptians), situated events in their writing. While differences of one or two decades are acceptable given the gaps in some parts of an ancient civilization's history, but the assumptions he makes would require re-dating the whole known history of ancient Egypt, which could be acceptable if he had the background to make such claims, and he has not.

Some more details of the faults in this documentary can be read in the Wikipedia, which cites references, unlike him.

In summary, this documentary draws mostly on highly disputed theories about history, which were clearly cherry-picked by the director to support his wild claims.

This documentary might serve as a model of how *not* to discuss history."

,Ronin969,2008-07-16T10:54Z,"menguzzi, you are a fool. LOL yes SOME of what he is stating seems to be shots in the dark, which he STATES.... you know, they are called hypothosys. any theory can't start without them. And the evidence he come p with AFTER those theories prove that they are at least PLAUSIBLE. why do u have to be such a hater? do you have evidence that what this documentary shows IS FALSE?! if not, STFU and stop hating until u have the obsoulute truth. how would it hurt you so much if these thing WERE true? it doesn't discount god in any way. Just that the events were done THROUGH nature, not magic. PS. the wikipedia shit didn't really anve any evidence AGAINST these theories. it even falsly states him ""admitting"" things that he never states, but people who work in museums who had never thought of thigns this way has said, nearly to a direct quote. Go find a someting that is DEFINATELY a lie to spend your life fighting against, like global warming"

,tripper511,2010-09-18T05:31Z,"It's real simple.  A volcanic eruption which happened in antiquity and could have caused some of the plagues if it occurred at the right time is the eruption of the Thera  volcano 650 miles to the northwest of Egypt. Controversially dated to about 1628 BC, this eruption is one of the largest on record, rivaling that of Tambora, which resulted in 1816's Year Without a Summer. The enormous global impact of this eruption has been recorded in an ash layer deposit found in the Nile delta, tree ring frost scars in the bristlecone pines  of the western United States, and a coating of ash in the Greenland ice caps, all dated to the same time and with the same chemical fingerprint as the ash from Thera."
