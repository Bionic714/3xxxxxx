,who66,2006-08-31T17:10Z,what program can i use to burn this file???
,assassinmonk,2006-09-05T19:33Z,".flac files can be played in Winamp with a free download.

If you use NERO to burn, you can also download a free plug-in to burn the .flac files straight into a normal CD.  I'm not too familar with other cd/dvd burning programs.

Nonetheless, if you search the net you should be able to find a free downloadable plug-in that will let you burn the .flacs into a normal CD."

,NewToasted,2006-09-11T15:49Z,"I've would buy the CD, if it wasn't for EMI. It feels like I can't be sure whether or not there CDs have some kind of worhless copy protection, which would make the CD worthless to me, since play all my music via the PC.

Uploader, THANKS A LOT!! Finally someone that understands that music is about sound quality as well! Will be a great package to test my new Sound card with!"
