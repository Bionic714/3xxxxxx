Psychiatrist Dr Park Dietz explores the cold-blooded actions of Mafia hit-man Richard Kuklinski, known as the Iceman, who has admitted to killing more than 200 people. Using interviews with the assassin, he tries to find out what makes a man able to commit murder without a second thought, looking at the childhood experiences which are thought to contribute to the creation of psychopaths, with a focus on the lack of positive male role models.
