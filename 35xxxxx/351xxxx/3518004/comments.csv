One of the best westcoast albums ever!"
,skymiles77,2006-11-08T08:07Z,"Good album. Not as much ""rock"" compared to Birdge 2 Far (shared here, as well), but solid songs. First track = strongest.
Many thanks!"

Stuck on 72.7%"
,fruktis1,2007-12-15T19:55Z,Thanx! Never found a copy for my own....it's a true classic! 
,Johnm71,2008-01-22T17:18Z,"ridiculously cool upload and at 320 bit rate. You kill me. You have uploaded the best offering of westcoast to piratebay. I also got Bill champlin runaway which I was missing in my digital collection, but Maxus, wow. What a treat. I have several Lp's of it, one new never played but I was murdering for this in digital.
If anybody has any LAVA (norwegian AOR group who's cd's are rare - in particular the classic ones) or if anyone has Greg Guidry Over the line at 320 (if possible) I would really appreciate it.
Right now, I don't know how to upload torrents but it can't be too hard, so I'm going to find out, but if anyone can hit me up with anything on my digital want list (lava and guidry are just two) I'll happily repay them with anything of mine, even 'promo cd's' (in the event I was so retarded I could'nt learn the torrent uploading).
Let's everybody send each other want and 'what we have lists' to start things off.
Posts like this are surely gonna see others hopefully be as generous in sharing there real westcoast classics. Thanks again.
And westcoastmaniac. Your a real saint for upping all these true rare offerings."
,Johnm71,2008-01-22T17:32Z,"not sure if people can contact each other through piratebay so here is my email (just set up and obviously inspired)... westcoastpsychopath@gmail.com

anybody feel free to send your 'want' and 'what you have' lists !

I always think 320bit is important with a lot of westcoast often already sounding frail on the cd's being from masters 20 years old etc, but that being said, even low bit rate is a good offering 

Just a few things off the top of my head that I have which I don't think are upped anywhere...

I-TEN taking a cold look (84), KIMBERLY FRANK 1000 miles (94 - great voice and great album in the total westcoast vein. Very rare and feat Joseph williams) EXILE Keeping it country (1980 - rare classic hi-tech westcoast/country release of don't leave me this way album)"
,Johnm71,2008-01-22T17:50Z,"here is a short note, for westcoast fans,  of torrents I have found here on piratebay in early 2008 (I am only listing the ones that I could successfully obtain, except in a few cases where I did not try to download the album as I have it already)

Please if anybody can add to this with info with things they know about, it would be much apppreciated

As of the week of late Jan 2008, I have found on Piratebay

Finis Henderson - Finis (1982 - successfully downloaded this cool cd)
Albert Hammond - Your world and my world (1981- did not download cause I already have this Incredible cd, but I saw many seeders)
Michael Ruff - Speaking In Melodies (1993 - successfully downloaded this nice release)
Patrick Simmons - Arcade (7? or 8? - successful download!)
American Flyer 2CD (76 and 78 - two albums on one cd from the classic early westcoast/country/folk band with craig fuller and eric Kaz - successful download)
Michael Sembello - Bossa nova Hotel (8? - successful download of this classic)
Also, most all of maniac's posts, needless to say.
I'll post more updates as I find them

Also it is worth searching via google for anything you have in mind as I found some other interesting posts that way that ended in successful downloads. Cheers"
