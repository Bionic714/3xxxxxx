,Mart32,2006-08-11T14:11Z,The files are just blank. just curius? what prog did FreakShO use to pack those files?
,Mart32,2006-08-11T14:18Z,"1. files are blank.
2. data in the files are not blank but filled up with               junk!
3. i think that FreakShO is aware of this.
4. this sucks, because this movie rocks!"
,FreakShO,2006-08-11T21:10Z,i used winrar....i dont know what u guys are talking about...
,gjesme473,2006-08-11T21:54Z,"Yes, this is the wrong set of winrar.   Dvd cover pictures is blank and the sample vob to preview does not work too.  I think Freaksho didnt know how to split up the vobs to winrar.   I even had tried to use 7-zip and that didnt help to work with the given rars."
,ottoniemi,2006-08-11T22:41Z,"Same here. 4,4 GBs of garbage!"

,canonball227,2006-08-13T18:21Z," I ""Think"" that the Source was/is OK

but when dickwod made the ""torrent file""

he cocked  that process  up somehow !

thats why  ""all"" the files are screwed

cuz if he was puttin up a fake file , would he not fake only the main rar files, and have a good pic,nfo % sample ??"
,canonball227,2006-08-13T18:41Z,"he made the torrent file ,tested it and somehow up'ed to P/bay the empty files, ""dumdass"""
