,annorlunda45,2006-11-25T23:14Z,"Asmogriff: Yes, so would I! Haven´t figured out how to convert the individual chapters to mp3, must be possible to do though. Any ideas anybody?
Was going to buy it at www.allofmp3.com but visa and mastercard has banned the site so that was not possible, arghh."
,annorlunda45,2007-01-21T20:14Z,"Well, I could not find the retail cd but I managed to convert the DVD chapters to mp3.

It is not a perfect solution but it will have to to for now..."
,annorlunda45,2007-01-28T23:48Z,"Just saw it in Gothenburg, it was actually great (despite the Swedish translation). Guess I am hooked..."
,annorlunda45,2007-03-14T23:32Z,"Sorry, some screw up, the DVD2mp3 rip is now found at http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3639608"

,Franklint,2009-12-02T01:36Z,"Great rip, thanks for this. Because I'm pedantic, would you mind telling me the exact, character-for-character name of the disk, the one that comes up when you put it in a computer?

Thanks again.

Cheers,
Franklint"
,Franklint,2009-12-13T11:31Z,"@Darktangent2:
This is a direct DVD rip. This means that, to play the files, you will need to either
1) burn the VIDEO_TS folder to a DVD and play it in a regular player, or
2) use VLC Media Player (or a similar application) to open the VIDEO_TS folder and play it as though it were a commercial DVD.

Have fun!

I'm still hoping for an answer to my question :(."
,annorlunda45,2010-01-17T14:18Z,"@Franklint: Have been looking around, I should have a booklet I found in a London theater somewhere but I cant find it now. If I ever find it I will post all the names then."
,annorlunda45,2010-01-17T14:24Z,"@Franklint: For now you will have to get the names from IMDB, http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0173714/fullcredits#cast"
,Franklint,2010-01-23T05:52Z,"@annorlunda45: Thanks for your help, but you misunderstand. When you created the DVDRip, you would have had to put the disk in your computer to copy it. When you put it in, what was the name of the disk? It would have been something like ""Cats"", ""CATS"", ""CATS_DISK1"" etc. Any chance you can help me out?"
,annorlunda45,2010-01-31T11:44Z,"@Franklint: Sorry, got your question now. It says just capital ""CATS""."
,Franklint,2010-01-31T13:11Z,"You are a gentleman and a scholar, sir. Thank you very much, and please enjoy your 2010 :D."
,Franklint,2010-01-31T13:13Z,"That last comment was to annorlunda45, obviously."
,happyyasu,2010-02-24T20:26Z,"Saw in London, Moscow and Irkutsk, gr8t-awesome-fabulous! "
,Indollia,2011-08-28T04:31Z,"To 
Asmogriff and annorlunda45 

If you have Realplayer (if not, it's a freedownload on the net), you can actually edit videos to where you have the sound but not the video and save that as a seperate file while keeping the original video in tact. You can also convert most files in Realplayer as well. Hope that helps! ^^"
,JohnERuddy,2012-03-05T12:47Z,"It took hours to download and finding out how to  make it play was frustrating. - But it was worth it in  the end. - Thanks for sharing.
