The longest ever running musical. Now the first Webber production especially filmed for DVD. Starring Elane Page as Grizabella (as it should be!, imho). A straight forward DVD rip, no compression and untouched audio (5.1 Dolby Digital and 2-stereo). There is a Making of Cats on DVD2 that may be uploaded on request?
