,maxiam,2006-09-04T20:35Z,This is an old version and doesn't work with QT7. Apple has a new version of this plugin.
,remizorrr,2007-07-29T16:55Z,"It works allright with my quicktime 7.1.6 the one in the directory ""6.3 or later"""
,MacBoy90,2007-10-26T19:29Z,"Well it worked out just fine for me-- you got to chose between QT6.3 or QT6.4 or later. So running this on 7.2: no problems.
Thanks for the upload ;)"

,DrLex,2007-11-30T18:58Z,Anyone have a version that works on Intel macs?
,chewy27,2007-12-19T09:43Z,"I have a brand new Intel mac with the newest QT7.what ever and it works fine, if you don't believe me DL and see "
,casperboo,2008-01-13T09:05Z,"I have Intel 10.5 Leopard, and it official does NOT work on Intel Macs with QT7"
,casperboo,2008-01-14T02:56Z,"There are 2 versions with 2 different sizes.  The 716k size is ONLY for PPC and will NOT under any circumstances work on Intel.  After install, Quicktime, MPEG Streamclip and any other software that uses it will not recognize it.  

The 2nd one is 868k and will work on both PPC and Intel.  That is the one you want, and I should have it posted soon."
,casperboo,2008-01-14T03:09Z,"Do NOT download this if you have Intel mac as it will NOT work.

Someone beat me to the upload I guess, because I couldn't find it before, but here is the link to the newer Component that works with Intel macs on QT versions 6 and 7.

,Liskrig,2009-03-08T16:27Z,"It's pathetic that Apple charges for a file that could fit on a 3.5"" disk. Thank you for the upload."
,aquaticcentre,2011-01-14T02:54Z,"video works for me, but no audio! running OS X 10.5.8 and quicktime 7.6.9. i am trying to play mpeg2 files that were transferred from my sony handycam... a lot of handycam users are having this problem despite apple saying they have a functioning codec.
