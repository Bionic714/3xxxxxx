Putumayo Records Presents:
Congo To Cuba 2002
An Afro-Latino musical odyssey from Africa to Cuba and back again.  
Rip 192kbs
Covers included

A musical reunion between the irresistible swing of Cuban son and the soul of West African salsa, Putumayo's Congo to Cuba is a memorable collection of Afro-Latin grooves. Inspired by the critical and commercial success of the Putumayo compilations Afro-Latino and Mali to Memphis we've gone back to the archives to uncover some classic and contemporary gems of Cuban music and Cuban-influenced African music. Congo to Cuba reveals the deep cultural connections between these two distant worlds. 
Congo to Cuba is a celebration of the ways in which music has helped keep the African-Cuban connection vibrant over the years. It features a number of the classic Latin recordings that were popular in Africa, as well as work by African artists who pay tribute to the Afro-Cuban sound. While time and distance may keep them apart, common heritage and family ties between West Africa and Cuba have provided a bond that can never be broken. The music on Congo to Cuba is a powerful and thoroughly enjoyable testament to the unifying nature of music.
