Friends of dark meditative ambient are in for another treat with this new co-creation from the Finnish ambient producer Doc and the Russian pianist Lena Selyanina. This album was inspired by Maurice Ravel's waltzes for the piano. There is a cinematic and dramatic feel in the music itself, and the sense of drama is accented by subtle lines, sighs and sounds originating from some noble and ambient movies by Wim Wenders, Ingmar Bergman, Krzysztof Kieslowski and Andrei Tarkovsky.
