Ohh, i just noticed that are some more popular films are not included in the box.

Like fra diavolo and few more, like the one that stan and ollie are busy with a lot of laundry on a moutian of laundey (forgot the film name).

Anyone knows why they didn't put all the movies in the box? Just a question,

thanks anyway."

Thank you!"
,denzel-uk,2006-08-31T22:56Z,"javil, i believe that mountain of laundy feature was Blockheads, which is  included in this collection."
,denzel-uk,2006-08-31T23:00Z,"or scratch that,
that was a mountain of beans lol
anyways i belive
the mountain of laundry one was flying deuces, which indeed is not on this collection..it is probably on other dvd releases tho, same with some other feature length l & h which idnt make it, heck, maybe hex is planning a release of this kinda thing shortly :)"
,Javil,2006-09-02T00:42Z,"ok, i hope so!

Fra diavolo was really funny, i had old video tapes (VHS) of it but i lost it.

Is here someone who can tell me which movies from stan and ollie (together) are made in there career. And i mean only the short and long where they speak (no silent). I am looking for al list..

thanks

,RootenMcflooten,2007-12-06T18:34Z,"Fyi, 'Jitterbugs' and 'The dancing masters' Arent in these sets either

Long live stan and ollie !"
,Drowlord,2008-01-09T20:28Z,"TPB deleted a few of these Hexen-NI Laurel and Hardy torrents because of outdated trackers and external tracker urls in the torrent.  I have found them all on other tracker sites, and attempted to correct them for posting on TPB.  However, I thought I knew how to do that, but when I tried it it appeared that I would have to remove trackers that contained active seeds and I didn't want to create a gimpy torrent.  So... I created a torrent filled with all of Hexen-NI's torrents.  Kinda lame, I Know.  Here it is: http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3969220/Laurel_and_Hardy_DVD_Vol_1-21_Torrents_by_Hexen-NI

Also... I've ripped all of these DVD's to XviD, and I'll post a torrent with these soon (when my seeding capacity isn't saturated by all these ISO's)"

,Armoured-Fury,2008-08-17T18:27Z,"Omg!!

I was just watching the tribute to the boys one of this dvd and when he said

""Author Stanley Jefferson was born into a theatrical family in Alvaston, England.""

I used to live in Derbyshire and Alvaston was like half a mile away.. Wow.. I never knew that o.O"
,Armoured-Fury,2008-08-17T18:34Z,"Whoops...

Ulverston

Not Alvastan.. Bugger! haha"
