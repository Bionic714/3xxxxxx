SINOPSIS: Another son of the old one Frankenstein (Cedrick Hardwicke) tries to clarify the truth on the monster (Lon Chaney Jr.) and he should fight with an 
ambitious colleague (Lionel Atwill) and with the hunchback Ygor (Bela Lugosi). Effective example of black comedy, with transplantes of brain, a monster 
that climbs to the roofs to descend the globe of a girl, apparatuses of crazy science, and an implausible and amusing plot of conquest of the world on the 
part of Ygor, in his higher rank of prominence in all the saga.
