Recoil, classic 3d shooter made by Zipper Interactive, first released 1998/99.

This release is COMPLETE with the original game CD music missing from the other ISO's that have been seeded before.

This is a NERO image, to burn it you need Nero 6 or another program that can read Neros image format.

To get the CD music to play during the game you MUST burn the game to a physical cd and keep it in your cd-rom, it will not work using daemon tools although you can install the game that way.

The game installs and works fine in all Windows versions, including XP x64. Make sure you select complete installation with the avi files and make sure you go into game options and turn on all effects and put everything to HIGH quality.

Some tips:

o F5 and F6 controls the information display and toggles between full or no hud. 

o M opens the map.

o 1-9 switches weapons.

o You can access "inaccessable" areas by blowing up craters in the ground and use them as a "natural ramps", you can also hide in a crater.

o You can destroy objects from very far away, but this takes a lot of the fun out of the game so don't do it all the time ;)

There is a complete PDF game manual on the CD to get the initial story and details on weapons and the different missions.

Although the official multiplayer servers are long gone you can host your own game once you get tried of the single player.
