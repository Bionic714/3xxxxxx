i used to play this, but i could not find it anywhere."
,az5,2006-09-06T19:11Z,"Recently moved completely to Vista RC1 and although this game wont install it works fine with some trickering.

Here's how to make it work in Vista:

1. Install the game in Windows XP.
2. Search for msvc*.dll in your system folder and copy all dll's it finds into the recoil installation dir (msvcp50.dll, msvcp60.dll ...etc about 7 dll's total).
3. Zip the complete recoil installation folder.
4. Unzip it to a folder in Vista.
5. Right click the Recoil.exe, select Properties, select ""Run as Administrator"", and ""Run in Win98 compatibility mode"". Enjoy the game !

Also make sure you have the proper graphics and soundcard drivers.

Can't live without my favorite game ;)"

,deepthoughtdevil,2009-04-18T21:17Z,"IF YOU WANT TO RUN THIS GAME ON WINDOWS XP, FOLLOW THESE INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Install the game from the burnt cd of this torrent. During installation, check the 'avi files' check box when it comes, so the game is installed fully on your system.

2. After the installation is complete, there will be a prompt to install DirectX 6. DO NOT install it. Click NO.

3. Go to the directory where the game is installed/ Example:D:\Games\Zipper\RECOIL. Right click on RECOIL.exe. Select 'Properties', Click on the 'Compatibility' tab, Check 'Run this program in compatibility mode for', Select 'Windows 98/Windows Me'. Click OK and you're done.


One thing to remember is that after you do this, don't run the game from the autoplay menu that you get when you put in your cd. Run the game either from an icon you can put on your desktop or from the Start Menu. This is very important coz if you try to run it from the Autoplay menu, it won't work.



Hope I Helped. Enjoy!"

I downloaded this and i can't load, can't save, there are fonts (text) missing for example, i see the options new game load game and all that stuff, but if i go to options i don't see the current detail level, or the resolution it says just 'screen resolution' and blank below where the current resolution should be. And ok that, but i can't load or save the game... i have windows 7 Starter (Acer Aspire ONE) help."
,ryrgh67,2011-05-30T14:43Z,"Guys, this is a NERO cd image (nero.com) so burn it using the Nero burner and it will be fine !! Game music may need a physical cd in the drive, if you have issues always try burning a cd using the correc software instead of some virtual cd crap that may or may not work !! 

The control issue is somethign with certain laptops and only with XP, try running in compatibility mode (right click the shortcut, properties, compatibility).

Install issue: try comaptibility mode, drag the installer onto desktop, create shortcut, right click, properties, compatibility.

The tearing is more difficult, seems never ATI cards/drivers can't handle this game, I would report it to ATI but I doubt they would care since it's an old game, solution: put in an older graphics card.

For most people this game works just fine as it is, just burn the cd properly !"
,ryrgh67,2011-05-31T15:03Z,"For those with ""tearing""/pixelating issues, the software mode from the first start screen always seem to work and is fast enough on newer computers, doesnt look that good though."
,DaGier,2011-06-17T13:49Z,"Thanks for the torrent. The game works but there are 2 problems. I can't adjust the controls. Whenever I click controls in the main menu the game crashes. My 2nd problem is moving the tank, whenever I press forward and release it, the tank still keeps moving forward and I have to press backward to stop it. This is pretty annoying since it's very hard to stand still... Can someone help me out?"
,JRJ-000,2011-07-21T10:04Z,I mounted the game to a virtual drive using Ultra ISO and it played fine. THANKS ah6.
,Cerebral222,2011-07-21T16:52Z,"Game works well: I mounted it with Alcohol 120's virtual drive, then opened up the disc, right clicked on the ""SETUP"" appilcation and set the compatibility mode to Windows 98 / Windows Me, then installed the game, works perfectly on windows 7 32 bit. Thanks for this upload ah6, a neat game I use with xpadder. Cheers."
,Hizze1337,2011-10-12T15:06Z,"Any one got this working on Windows 7 64b?
Starting screen is fine, and the sound works in the begining. its just freezes exacly when your about to start playing.

Tried ""Run as administrator"" ""Compability"",running directly from a physical CD.

last hope is to download Windows XP 32 bits and hope:(

Anyone know how to fix it, please tell:)

Ty for UL"
,B.AJAYADI,2011-11-27T05:27Z,"hey! hey! hey! everyone who download this torrent please read this thing:
actually this is a game of windows 98, so after mounting and installing the game open the game's directory folder you have installed.
next from the file ""recoil.exe"" rigth click and click
properties.
then check the box ""run this program in compatibility mode for windows 98/me"" option in the list box
then click apply and ok.
then run the game
cheers"
,Thiopental,2011-11-29T00:36Z,"This one is complicated, but if you want to install this awesome game on win7 X64 you`ll need to install the Application Compatibility Toolkit from Micro$oft.
When you first run the 32Bit version (both x32 and x64 are available), click the FIX button.
On the new dialog window name the program as Autorun and the vendor name EA. Locate the autorun.exe file with the browse button and click next.

Select Win95 compatibility mode and, in the dropbox below (additional compatibility modes) select ONLY --> Layer_Win95VersionLie "
