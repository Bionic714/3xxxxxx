there are lots of other websites where you can download hundreds of extra venues. dont forget that there are lots of venues in this pack that you have to import yourself.its a chew on but worth it just read the readme.txt happy fishing"

I have tried changing the compatability and video settings, but still no worky. I am running XP with 512 MB of Ram and a 128 MB Nvidia video card. Any suggestions or help would be greatly appreciated."
,Blazeu,2008-05-12T19:11Z,works fine thanks uploader. OPEN FISHISM FOLDER CLICK ON A FILE I USED GO1 IT WILL THEN ASK YOU TO OPEN WITH THEN PICK CHOOSE APPLICATION TO OPEN FILE AND SCROLL TO WINRAR THEN EXTRACT INTO A PLACE YOU CHOOSE GO TO THE FOLDER YOU EXTRACTED IT TO AND RUN SETUP
,mecca30uk,2008-09-29T22:40Z,"If your having trouble using this in vista, simply install to C:
Rather than program files which it will do automatically.

you may still need to change compatability by rught clicking the .exe file"

i use vista 32 bit and dont have it directly installed on c: i just run it in compatability mode


right click on the files and click on open with, then browse to winrar.exe in your program files and it should open fine, i just messed up the raring a bit"
