Whether you want to float, ledger, fly, lure or go sea fishing this amazing 
simulator will allow you to fish on your pc in the most realistic way ever.  
Fish the lochs of Scotland, the canals, lakes and shores of England, Ireland and 
France or even Australia from the comfort of your PC, when you want, any time of 
the day, no matter what the weather
You can catch carp, trout, salmon, pike, perch, tench, eels, rays, pollock, 
catfish, bream - in fact almost everything you can catch in the water - it's 
right here!

Although great fun, fishsim is not strictly a fishing game.  It is fishing 
simulated.  Ever caught a 20lb plus carp on a light set up and had to play the 
fish for an age?  Have you been lure fishing for perch or chub and a 30lb pike 
snaps and heads off to the horizon?  Anything that can happen in the real world 
is simulated here in fishsim.

Amazing real images of actual fishing venues such as the Avon at Chippenham, 
Loch Lubhair or Newquay Bay with realistic weather, local climate and real water 
motion effects.  With more than 500 pegs to choose from you can fish a different 
peg every day for a year and still have over 100 left to try!  

What about tackle? Choose your rod, line rig, feeder, bait and hook from 
thousands of combinations.  If you can keep up the pace set up two rods, perhaps 
one on a float and the other ledgered with a bite alarm just waiting for a 
monster to take and run.
