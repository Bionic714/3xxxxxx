Release Notes:

With one firm foot in the hardcore community and
the other stomping in the metal scene RAISED FIST
are back to leave us breathless with the
deliverance of their fourth studio-album.

With the new intense wall of sound killer-album
?Sound of the Republic? the focus and determination
to take their brutal hardcore to a new level is
stronger than ever. Completely destroying all
boundaries - this is the new sound of the Raised
Fist republic!

Over the years RF has become a well respected name
in the hardcore scene. Formed back in 1993 when the
scene in Europe started to simmer, the band took it
first steps with influences taken mainly from bands
as Gorilla Biscuits and Youth Of Today. A couple of
early ep?s, followed by the three full-length
albums ?Fuel?(?98), ?Ignoring The Guidelines? (?00)
and ?Dedication? (?02) has lead to a gradual
musical development, as well as earning them fine
criticism from many leading music-magazines as well
as massive support and legendary cult-status among
the kids.

With the ferocious onslaught, variety and
flexibility and musical maturity of ?Sound Of The
Republic?, Raised Fist lead by mad-man Alexander
"Alle" Rajkovic, and strengthened by the
recruitment of Matte Modin's (Dark Funeral) razor
sharp drumming, in addition with the excellent work
of producer Daniel Bergstrand (In Flames,
Meshuggah, Strapping Young Lad) has come up with a
record that certainly will be a milestone in the
bands career as well as shaping the European
hardcore/metal landscape in 2006.

Raised Fist deliver sheer brutality - a pissed of
aggression that makes you feel like you are being
repeatedly battered in the faced with a large
hammer. As painful as it may sound - if you don't
like getting sonically ridden over - just look
elsewhere!!!
