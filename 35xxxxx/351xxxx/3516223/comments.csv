,DrChandra,2006-09-16T20:07Z,it's a decent docu and there was a 600meg tv rip out earlier. in the interest of bandwidth perhaps someone could recode it to xvid. 6-8 times as many copies for the same bandwidth should have an appeal

Seriously though, this is a very good doco, with a destintive lack of blurry glowing things (and no Moonies for as far as the eye can see!)"
