,winson,2006-08-12T15:28Z,Thanks! =O)
,athletic,2006-08-15T14:47Z,"Dude, if you are really interested go buy the swedish book. It costs merely 149 SEK, at Adlibris or Bokia. Small investment for a good entertaining book, and you may learn some useful stuff at the same time. Well worth the money if you'd ask me."
,Jadine,2006-11-14T19:32Z,"I've got this book translated in finnish (by myself), if someone needs it, send me email.

,n_karlsson,2007-08-25T20:53Z,kan du inte l채gga upp den svenska?
,Puppet_Master,2007-09-04T22:06Z,Dude I'm going to enjoy this book so much
,Striker2005,2007-12-11T23:43Z,That book really sucked. A bunch of nerds trying to get laid. Amusing for the first 100 pages but after that plain boring.
,iNB,2008-02-26T19:16Z,"This book came to me with a shock. 
I would never, ever, have imagined something like this to be real.

,SrU Claytonian,2008-09-02T22:02Z,"@jkillah1
Me too.  Damnit."
,Pyros89,2008-09-04T22:30Z,"First I thought this was a cheesy guide to ""get any girl you want"" and all that shit, but for my suprise it turned out to be an interesting book instead of guide. I was even more suprised when I found out that Mystery method and Real Social Dynamics (or somethign) are really real. Now that gave a new look for the book since I thought it was fiction while I read the book. "
,dartb,2008-09-22T23:59Z,I've just lost.
,dsaintx,2008-10-04T03:38Z,"after reading the book, i recommended it to a few friends. so much so, the local borders bookstore went out of stock. believe it, i even heard a guy who came all the way from a neighbouring country to get this book. 

entertaining read this 1."

Go there to find out why I lost the game..."
,serotoninjunkie,2008-10-17T07:54Z,"AMAZING. Works REALLY well, I didn't even finish the book and I'm kiss-closing and getting numbers like crazy.. although it makes me feel very hollow sometimes depending on how fake you are. Sex loses some value when you can do it all the time too.. I already had some NLP background and with it, it's like butter. The clothes just flow of her body it feels like.. takes so little energy"
,PFC4LIFE,2008-11-13T13:04Z,I lost but was winning for over 40 years till just now.

,paper1111,2009-05-25T09:12Z,"ok im confused, what this losethegame.com shit supposed to be?
