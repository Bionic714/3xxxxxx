Are any of these abridged?"
,V_Lenz,2006-09-21T20:44Z,Thank you very much for this release !!!
,avaksi,2006-09-26T22:20Z,Thanks a lot for this. The other books incl the Butlerian Jihad ones are avl at http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3527070/The_Rest_of__The_Complete_Dune_Audio_Books
,Darklight310,2006-10-27T06:34Z,The tone and voice are dull and flat - almost as if a computer reads it.
,kwikky,2006-10-31T21:36Z,"I see ""House Atreidis"" is also included. I also have these audiobooks, but the ""House Atreidis"" audio book I have is corrupted. It seems that the original tape was twisted or something. It starts off ok, but along the way it's like it's being played backwards."
,heimdall39,2006-11-09T01:40Z,"hey could someone seed this, please. pretty please."
,arronax,2006-12-02T08:53Z,omg thx thx thx thx ^^ 
,the almighty dude,2007-01-14T01:42Z,"Ok guy, you don't really know what you're talking about. I think you guys gave up after dune messiah, didn't you? Frank Herbert was a genius and the dune world evolved into the pinical of sci-fi. They just get better and better. heretics is my favorite. Now you've got them on audio you might give them the chance they deserve. his son's work is ok to an extent but reaching frank's level IS impossible.

To all the people who haven't read dune; enjoy. you are about to visit the greatest saga ever written.

P.S. Star wars and harry potter can suck my left nut"
,bodeb,2007-01-31T00:47Z,"@the almighty dude

U live in Libanon? Where I live ppl can say whatever they want, So if one finds one book better than the other he is allowed to say so.
So... shut ur cakehole, you want freedom of speech as long as it is ur kinda speech...? Go read dune for once ;-) U Braveheart.

For my comment on the torrent; very nice =)"
,olizog,2007-05-15T07:10Z,This is a great find! But what a tease. It doesn't work on WMP or VLC. How do I get this to Play? Thank
,phatzmb,2007-08-15T16:13Z,"This is the shit. The entire Dune series is right up there with the best literature ever written.

None of these are abridged right?"
,museiscool123,2008-03-17T04:33Z,AMAZING lol i cant be assed to read them so i got the audiobooks will seed for long time
,SmegBrains,2008-03-26T05:22Z,"Thanks for the upload, but the guy reading most of these books is ridiculous.  I can't listen to his voice for more than a few seconds, let alone many hours.  Too bad."
,Ursinus,2008-04-11T01:14Z,"I just love bodeb's moronic comment.  Freedom of speech may apply to opinions but it also applies to criticism of those opinions.  As for hating freedom of speech, telling someone to shut their ""cakehole"" is about as hating on that freedom as you can get.  Not to mention this site is from Sweden so only Swedish law applies."
,wbwoodford,2008-04-26T05:47Z,Please continue to seed....stuck at 90%
,mUnTe,2008-04-27T19:16Z,"OOhhhh the horror.

The original books are read by som freak with a horrible accent and it sounds speedup. Makes me want to kill myself, goddamn awful uuhwl..."
,mUnTe,2008-04-27T19:20Z,oooh i think im going to puke...
,mUnTe,2008-05-03T20:41Z,hmm i think there is about 1 hour or more missing from Heretics of Dune (Dune 5)
,Tbone139,2008-06-01T11:23Z,"I registered just so I could rant on this. Children of Dune is the first novel I tried from this set, (having read the previous 2) and I'm giving up on it because the narrator sounds constantly cynical and unemotive, with a ceaseless warble. The only voice that comes to mind close to this narrator is huckleberry hound, taking away the southern influences and adding flamboyant overtones. (Sentences ending higher than his vocal register would indicate.) I'd rather listen to a software-based voice."
,divine03,2008-06-13T04:54Z,"Can someone please help to put these in some kind of order?  House Atreides, House Harkonnen, House Corrino, Dune, Messiah, Children of Dune, God Emperor of Dune, Heretics of Dune, Chapterhouse Dune, The Road to Dune, Hunters of Dune, The Butlerian Jihad, and Sandworms.  Or if I am Missing  Something, Please say something."
,TawnyT,2008-06-14T13:43Z,"this would be sweet, but the person reading is so awful it makes these books un-listenable..."
,divine03,2008-06-14T17:59Z,Dune Messiah is out of order.
,MattDWeed,2008-08-10T22:08Z,"Thanks. 
Dune: The Butlerian Jihad (Great book)
Dune: The Machine Crusade (Great book)
Dune: The Battle of Corrin (Great book)
Dune: House Atreides (Good book)
Dune: House Harkonnen (Okay book)
Dune: House Corrino (Okay book)
Dune (Good book)
Dune Messiah (Okay book)
Children of Dune (Great book if you reach the end)
God Emperor of Dune (Good book)
Heretics of Dune (Kind of boring book, but I'm still reading it)

Darklight310 is kind of right about the voice being flat and dull, but the Dune series of books are meant to be more kind-of-intellectual books. They are not meant to be screaming emotional/annoying stories.

Some minutes of audio are missing (or just quite and distorted) in some of the books, but still a very good read. 

I highly suggest reading it all."
,Porphyrogen71,2008-10-23T12:29Z,"God bless you, bigbadbrian : )"
,sanfranciscojack,2008-10-30T00:58Z,"Don't waste your time. Completely unlistenable. 

I don't know who this guy is that is reading these books but whoever hired him should be taken out and shot. Seriously, why would you want somebody with a wheezy nasal voice to read 9 books? Trying to listen to this is pure torture. *sigh* and I was /so/ looking forward to these. "
,581011,2008-12-03T01:23Z,"I'm currently downloading, but I've listened to a hard copy of House of Atreides...Tim Curry narrated that one at least...not sure who does the others."
,zadig1,2008-12-08T09:14Z,"If you think that any of the dune novels are just ""good"" or boring or anything less than the best of all sci fi then you are a shallow person and should stick with Harry Potter."
,marius2859,2009-01-20T06:08Z,There are new versions of all the original books.  They are done in a more dramatic style with multiple readers.  
,cros,2010-04-06T01:56Z,I had version read by Conner O'Brien...can't forget the name: sounds like Conan O'brien.  Anyway i'll search my files see if I can find it but I think it's gone.  Anyone have the Conner O'Brien version?
,vinveezy,2010-05-14T20:31Z,this is DAN GOOD nice job man! Seriously. Fuck that moron saying it does not work it is just FINE
,Fuddhed,2010-08-22T16:30Z,"I would like to start by thanking bigbadbrian for taking the time and effort to upload this. It does take effort, and for that I am grateful. The following comment does in no way detract from my gratitude nor impugn him in any way.

There may have been times  in your life when you've experienced horror. Perhaps terror. Perhaps you can remember the sound of a car accident victim wailing shrilly  and sobbing over a decapitated relative as you were forced to drive past their personal trajedy explicitly exhibited for the world to see as a tableau of twisted metal perfused in blood atop body parts splayed across the highway as the traffic moved on uneffected by the gruesome death only feet away from their cars. 

Or maybe you've been present when a cat manages to catch a small rabbit and discovered that rabbits can scream when their life is ending viciously in the jaws of a predator. The shreik a rabbit makes is surprisingly bloodcurdling for an othewise mute animal.

Possibley you were present when a mass catastrophe occured; an earthquake, a terrorist crime or a building fire and can intensely recall the screams and cries of innocent people  witnessing senseless death all around them with howls of pain and anguish so distorted and primal that it was difficult to believe that they were coming from humans. The sound of lost children wailing for their dead parents to wake up mixed with shrieking pleas for mercy, help or death from the injured so deafening that you found yourself momentarily questioning the existence of God while simultaneously wondering if youre among the dead and in Hell.

As horrible as those sounds may be, as chilling to the soul as they are, none of it compares to the experience of listening to thirty seconds of this audiobook. You find yourself ready to relax to a treasured piece of literature and then only moments later scrambling as though your face was on fire to find the mouse to shut off the soul-leeching moan that is the voice of the reader, speaking in tones that actually challenge your assumption that it's a human speaking. Perhaps, like me, you'll scream in horror yourself and be in such haste to shut off not just the player, but upset an ashtray with a burning cigarette, a coffee mug and accidentally trample your beloved cat who then bolts from the room with a screeching howl than is actually favorable in comparison to the groaning whine coming from your computer as you drop to the floor to unplug it as well as a stereo on the same outlet just for good measure.

I can compare this sound, this feeling to nothing other than the feeling I got when I was linked to ""3 Guys & 1 Hammer"" and watched and listend as an inocent man was clubbed to death over a period of 15 long minutes. But unlike that video, this time I felt the need to cry before plugging the computer back in. Nor did the 'hammer' video make me contemplate praying to God to make me deaf rather than be ever subject to such spirit tormenting sounds again. Part of me died listening to the first thirty seconds of this; I felt somehow that the narrator had raped my ears, and that music would never feel quite the same. I remembered a flash of the Kubrick film ""Clockwork Orange"" where Alex jumps out a window from the torturous music and understood the scene in a way that I may never would have before being subject to this audiobook reading. I got a shower before coming back to the computer, spending most of the time with either ear directly connected to the shower-head roaring away, gushing water into my ears as I tried to wash the memory away and forget the horror. The horror.

If you must test fate and listen to this, give your silverware to a neighbor to hold on to,  as I suspect that another ten seconds and any creature unable to make the audiobook stop fast enough would simply resort to shoving knives into their ears to stop the pain and cruelty. Also refrain from eating for four hours before or after trying to listen to it; nothing will stay down and youll simply make a mess if you can t get to the toilet fast enough."
,honunetcti,2010-08-31T07:39Z,@Fuddhed  Best comment ever.  So you are saying u didnt like it?
,zadig1,2010-09-11T01:35Z,"Fuddhed, that was hilarious! cheers.  By the way I'm such a big fan of Frank Herbert that I did listen to all of the original Dune books in the torrent."
,cros,2010-09-12T01:55Z,"Ok someone wanted to know which books to read, and in what order.

The original author is where you want to start.  

1. Frank Herbert - Dune series
2. Dune Messiah
3. Children Of Dune
4. God Emperor of Dune

These are all written in sequel.  I have read this novel many times and these 4 books are complete masterpieces of literature.

If you can't spare the time, atleast try to get through the first 3.  The 4th book, which is actually my personal favorite, is during the end of the reign of the great dictator.  The god of all men.  Half man and half sand worm, he is the God Emperor of Dune.

The last 2 books written by Herbert Sr. are not my personal favorites.  I did read them, but I don't recommend them to anyone.  They are technically in sequel to the first 4.  But none of the old characters exist.

Anyway, the book speaks for itself.  Go read on wikipedia.  Dune is one of the first books to ever win both the hugo and nebula awards jointly.  I recommend most every book that has won both awards.  Enjoy.

,TawnyT,2010-10-28T22:09Z,"I agree with ""Fuddhed"". Totally."
,dvalmont136,2010-11-10T03:50Z,"LOL @ Fudhead, hilariously awesome and sadly true...  How does something like this happen.. :("
,Banjoboots,2010-12-28T02:45Z,"After reading Fudhead's comment (BTW - I laughed till I cried),  I was driven to downloading these audio books. Could it really be that bad?  Er, yes it could.  If you really want to experience this for yourselves, I recommend download one book only but do so at your own risk.  Pins in the eyes is preferable.  YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!"
,mohiergauth,2010-12-28T18:31Z,"This sort of thing happens my fellow humans, because the ones making the decisions are complete morons. It happens for the same reason that Adobe completely screwed up macromedia, EGO. Whoever sucks the most rectum gets the job, never the best qualified. It is a shame. The same thing happened to SK's Gunslinger series, they reissue the audio with some valium~head reading, and take SK's readings off the market.......WE ARE A DOOMED SPECIES!"
,bakaonna,2010-12-28T18:32Z,"Fuddhed made the best comment ever. While my opinion might be influenced by the connection his chosen subject has to my favourite author, I must say it is a (personal and subjective) honour to share this humble site with him/her.
Furthermore, driven by the same subjective feeling, I propose to somehow make this comment know as the greatest comment ever posted on the internet, and a crowning achievement for the interacting flow of information that it represents.
That is all."
,Mal--Man,2011-01-03T17:24Z,"Fuddhed, I totally agree. Connor O'Brien and his fucking robot voice are more than just a little irritating.

Does anyone know where I can find the 'Children of Dune' audiobook that is NOT narrated by a monotone voice synthesized asshole? I've looked on every torrent site there is, I can't find anything. Every download that shows promise has 0 seeds or doesn't say the reader's name. And when I download it, it's fucking Connor O'Robot-Voice everytime, without fail.

,c3bhm,2011-02-04T11:04Z,"House Atreides
&
God Emperor of Dune

are read by THE WORST voice you could ever imagine somehow getting hired to do this professionally.  It's impossibly bad reading.  Like a robot that treats a line break like a period: ""I'm going to the.  Store to buy some milk.""
It's surreal!"
