,djmopa,2006-09-25T06:07Z,"complete shit, after reloading computer. The computer loads, and spy sweeper tries to load, it then freezes, and the whole system lags. I finally was able to uninstall it, and everything is back to normal, well close, except for the spyware.

It may work for some, but for me, it made things worse."
,frankie79,2006-09-27T11:30Z,"@djmopa ...it works perfect for me, wich OS do you have? Got all updates?"
,frankie79,2006-11-07T11:28Z,Stop downloading this old version now! You can download v5.2.3 (Build 2125) here.
,Lynswin,2007-03-21T10:35Z,"Anyone managed to the updater working in Vista (I am running version5.2 of Spysweeper)? I have moved the crack into the Spy Sweeper folder but when I run it I get various messages: If I press 'kill' it says ""No definitions file in the selected directory. Please use 'choose directory' to navigate to the masters directory"". If I run 'update' anyway I get ""Spy Sweeper cannot download the definition to this location. Please install Spy Sweeper and try again"". Any help would be appreciated. Thanks"
