free for distribution as-is,
play it on your radio station,
use it in your video,
burn it to cd,
all as long as you mention my website : www.realisation.org
for 5 seconds in film, written on the cd, spoken words on radio...


some interesting notes on some of the tunes:

flute and drums on track 1 played by myself (well done! mmm.)
3838 voices : eat my moomoo beans, past last centuary, eat my salmon til the fishcakes come home, i eat rapberries twice a day.
drymen : samples of radio police recordings when i was in london, and some shortwave samples
turn your life over : vocal by myself as well, eastern voice from a sample disc "voices of india"
the callsign of the blue angel : the weird samples generated by picture to sound conversion
convention: weird ambience created by using sony's acoustic mirror with not impulse files but other samples
iconoclast 3rd: entire tune put through pi-warp
love:kettle boiling in the background
lygoranicides and two blocks from murder:wrote these when i came up to scotland..
