Every single track is great, they've managed to keep the spirit of the original songs, and toughened them up a lot. Recommended! I have listened to it so many times, and still not tired of it. Whenever I browse my MP3 collection, I always end up playing at least some tracks from this album!

This reminds me why I now download music before I buy it, after having bought so many albums that were utter garbage (to me, anyway). Thanks PB."
