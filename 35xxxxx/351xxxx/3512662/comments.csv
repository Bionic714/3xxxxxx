Really nice upload, I discovered it recently, so I quitted seeding S6D6 and jumping on this!

if somebody have problem downloading the torrent-file from  torrents.thepiratebay.org, use the IP: 83.140.176.147 ->
http://83.140.176.147/hashtorrent/3512662.torrent/Star_Trek_DS9_S6D7.3512662.TPB.torrent

It seems that there is some DNS messup. ;)"
