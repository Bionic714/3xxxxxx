NOTICE: PLEASE SEED. If you download this, please keep it up and available for others. I am trying to give back to the community, and have several good torrents to offer. However, seeding each one takes up 3/4 of my up bandwidth, which prevents me from working. (I'm a neuroscientist and analyze large datasets from MRI and such; I take in 20 to 40 GB, analyze it, and send back 2 to 4 GB of result). So please help me to give back to the community and seed these if you can, for as long as you can.

Jarre in China (2005) is a 2 DVD (and CD of the music) compilation of two concerts Jarre gave in China in 2004, plus many extras with commentary, primarily aimed at exposing the world to the political and social situations in China. He obviously hopes to help bring about change. This is a noble cause. However, the concerts alone, without the commentary and editorial pieces, would take up about 2/3 of a DVD. If you want the full material, you can download the 2 DVD + 1 CD set elsewhere. That's where this material came from. Some people are only interested in the music. This file contains only the two concerts, the first at Wumen Gate at the Forbidden City (just over an hour long), the second at Tianamen Square (about 22 minutes). They are converted with DivX 6.3 and have a DivX inserted menu in front. You can use the menu if you wish to watch only the second concert; if you start the first concert the file will play straight through both. The audio was sampled at 320k, in order to provide the maximum quality available from the original. The video (sampled at 1400k) suffers a very few minor irregularities, primarily where a thin object such as a street light is sitting in front of a wide, monocolored background, But these are so small and few that they do not detract significantly from the viewing.

There being no IMDB entry, if you're interested I suggest the Amazon review at http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00069KFJQ/026-2624205-6016421
