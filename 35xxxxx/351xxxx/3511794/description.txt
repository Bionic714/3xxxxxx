Game Notes :

You┬┤ll find here wizards, dragons , heroes and household hygiene
Specialists. There is danger here, but there is also custard around the
place. Because Discworld is a fantasy world with low reality threshold.
The real world keeps on breaking through - but Discworld changes it.

So You┬┤ll find here things that you sort of recognize.

Discworld has got photography (tiny imps paint the picures) and movies
(tiny imps paint really fast) and it even getting its second generation
of computers now that the old stone circles don┬┤t work fast enough.

However, because it is a fantasy world there are some things that it
has to have, and one of them is certain tendency to experience some
trouble with dragons.

Unfortunately, a dragon is now ravaging Ankh-Morpork, the world┬┤s
leading city. Many people would consider that this falls under the
heading of civic improvement, but what Ankh-Morpork needs right
now is a hero. All it┬┤s got, however, is Rincewind the wizard, whose
only talent is that he is not in fact dead yet. He also has the luggage,
the nastiest piece of travelware in the Universe. With that at his side,
there is probably no limit to the things he can fail to do...

oh, did i say he? I meant... you.

Beware of anyone who TALKS LIKE THIS and carries a scythe,
and remember that a loaded pun sometimes goes off...

... and have fun..
