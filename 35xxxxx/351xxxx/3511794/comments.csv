,Funkah,2006-11-13T21:03Z,"Does the seeder/leecher statistics near the top of the page sometimes lag?

Cause it's saying 7 seeders and my torrent program says two (connected to one of 'em).

And, if anyone would reseed this.. I'd love you to Sweden and back."

,Helldron,2009-04-12T19:42Z,"Alright, I know I need to mount it, but when I do, I get a folder containing DISCWRLD, DISCWRLD.CD, DISC.bat, The manual, and DWU.

Sooooo...What am I supposed to do?"
,BinkyDeath,2010-05-08T03:54Z,"Mantropolix - can you please contact me or leave a post on the torrent you created for Discworld 2 please?

I have a major problem with Discworld 2 as the DW2_CD2_ENG.iso file shows up as actually being for Disc ONE.

I've tried everything to get the game to work and the file IS labelled Disc 2 (TWO) but it definetely says Disc 1 when I mount the drive with Alcohol.

I'm on the forum for Pirate Bay if you want to talk to me but you can post here or on the other torrent, I don't mind.  I'm worried you may have uploaded the same iso twice but with two labels.  They look exactly alike (same files on them both).

Would you please confirm whether there's an error or if it's something else hun?  I can't play disc 2 although disc 1 works perfectly.  

Thanks hun.  xXx"
,BinkyDeath,2010-05-08T03:59Z,"@katieva Hi there. I haven't downloaded this torrent yet but I'm guessing Mantropolix included a piece of software called ScummVM.  If not download it at www. scummVM .org and get it.
Once you've got Scumm VM run it and you'll have a window that says Add Game on one of the buttons on the right hand side.
That brings up a menu - choose the folder with that drop down menu (you want the folder your Discworld game is saved in / extracted to) and click Choose.
It should find the game for you.  Click Start and play your game.

ScummVM is your best choice but there's also DOSBox which is harder to use.  I can provide instructions if you need them but try ScummVM first and you probably won't.

Hope that helps you honey.  xXx  Binks"
,BinkyDeath,2010-05-08T04:00Z,"Forgot to say:  ScummVM is an emulator that you need to play old DOS games on (just in case you didn't know what it was and why you needed it).
Moderm computer won't play old out-of-date games without an emulator. x"
,BinkyDeath,2010-05-09T12:40Z,"I can't get this version of Discworld 1 to work with ScummVM or DOSBox.  I'm on Windows 7 Home Premium.
Mantropolix would you please reply to me about these cracked games?  
I can't even try this game in DOSBox because I don't know the command to run it and there is only an iso file there - no instructions at all and no directory to look at to get the right file name to run.
Please reply - I've been trying to get hold of you all over the place now.  :-("
,robertpnz,2011-02-13T13:42Z,"@Binky: Mount the ISO file with a virtual disc emulator such as DTLite
