Contains both albums released by swedish band Urga. The first, Etanol, is more etno-based, while the second, Urgasm, is more dubby. Both features a nice mix of rock, klezmer, reggae, gypsy music, electronica and balkan folk music. Both albums are kickass party music albums, but Urgasm is more of a pot album.
