I have captured most of the season 5 from the SciFi Sky UK channel
The pictures are directly captured from the satellite stream (704x576 PAL MP2 sound)
and after removal of the commercials, the files are converted XviD AVI files of 350 Mb each with MP3 CBR 128 bps sound (around 42 Mb)
I have captured in this manner the episodes 5x03 to 5x17. 

Later I recovered the episodes:
5x01 - found one of my digital video tapes and with the help of [b]paniq[/b] , who provided me with 35 missing seconds at the beginning.
5x02 - completely provided by [b]paniq[/b] as a video file in 640x480 picture format and an English soundtrackand 44.1 kHz audio sampling rate. A minor point is that the main title Sliders has a German under title \"Sliders - Das Tor in eine fremde Dimension\", which means \"Sliders - The portal to a strange dimension\", and the German episode title is \"Qu√§lend Erinnerungen\", which means so much as \"Troubling Memories\", but it is really the \"Applied Physics\" episode. 
5x18 - recaptured from the UK ScFi channel. This is a complete different version, which was made available earlier and has a sound synch problem.

One of the viewers discovered that 60 seconds at the start were missing from the episode 10 Easy Slider.
I found on my older video tape that he was right and captured those missing seconds. The quality is a little bit less and there are some glitches, but for the rest is it Ok. I provided this collection with the original version of 5x10 Easy Slider and the fixed version. So you can take your pick.
This description is just an addendum for the \'description.txt\' file.

5x10 - the FIXED version have the 60 missing seconds at the start. These 60 sec. are from tape, which contains some glitches. As a consequence of just appending the file to the non-fixed version, it is 20 Mb larger and does not satisfy the requirement of half a CD.


The set is now a complete Sliders Season 5 in PAL
