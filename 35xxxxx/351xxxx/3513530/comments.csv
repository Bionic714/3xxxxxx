,TheHooligan,2007-09-22T01:30Z,"Well, I searched hard to actually find this, and when I finally did I could not just leave it on my harddrive, instead of uploading it in the form of a torrent. Thank you very much and enjoy!"
,Wopatoolie,2008-02-25T01:57Z,"you dun good hooligan. im not dloading this cuz i saw it when it first came out as a kid and i know it is a god awful film (not your copy, the film in general), but a must have for loyal kiss fans. Cold Gin! :P"
,3Storms,2008-07-18T01:41Z,The quality was crap to begin with since it was made for 1970's TV's and not the theaters. 
,warsmith1,2010-05-11T21:26Z,the only REAL flaw i see is its out of sync in the first file.  its old ya but that dosent make it bad.  nice find Hooligan.
