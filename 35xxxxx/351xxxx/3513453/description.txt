Synopsis

Robert Redford leads an all-star cast in one of the most satisfying films of the year! Computer expert Martin Bishop heads a team of renegade hackers -including a former CIA emplyee, a gadgets wizard, a young genius and a blind soundman- who are routinely hired to test security systems. But Bishops past comes back to haunt him when government agents blackmail the "sneakers" into carrying out a covert operation: tracking down an elusive black box. Along with his former girlfriend, Bishops team retrieves the box and makes a stunning discovery -the device can break into any computer system in the world. With factions from all sides willing to kill for the powerful box, Bishop and his team embark on their most dangerous assignment ever in this exhilarating high-tech caper from Phil Alden Robinson (Field of Dreams).
