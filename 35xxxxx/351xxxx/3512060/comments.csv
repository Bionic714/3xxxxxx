,tutike2000,2006-08-13T14:09Z,is this the same as the torrent on isohunt ?
[V],SCORPION2000,2006-08-13T14:37Z,Thanks!!! :D
,Felgard,2006-08-13T15:53Z,i am seeding only problem is im slow (60Kb/s)
,cela4yah,2006-08-13T16:52Z,"Ok, we wait. Thanks for seeding."
,Son Of Mogh,2006-08-13T17:02Z,I can't find anywhere what system requirements this games has. It sounds really cool though. I hope I can play it on my pc.
,Felgard,2006-08-13T17:08Z,"Homepage: http://darkstarone.ascaron.com/gb/gb_darkstarone/home/home.php 

requirements: http://darkstarone.ascaron.com/gb/gb_darkstarone/system/system.html"
,Kheynom,2006-08-13T17:11Z,"Yes, it's the same torrent as at Isohunt. I'm uploading too... ;)

Requirements are here: http://darkstarone.ascaron.com/gb/gb_darkstarone/system/system.html"
,DaDDeh,2006-08-13T17:43Z,"This is not cracked ok, but does it still install and play if mounted ?"
,Kheynom,2006-08-13T17:49Z,"It installs w/o problems, but it cannot be played because of that Tages protection... I've tried almost everything including DT, Alcohol, PowerISO, blacklisting tools... I've even burned it with 1x speed, then uninstall of that emulation tools, but I'm still getting ""Insert original DVD ""Darkstar"" """
,Felgard,2006-08-13T18:05Z,the main reason as to why i uppload is in the description but also to allow people to download it so the dont need to download 4.33 gig when reloaded or som other group crack it and just download the crack
,Dancingwind,2006-08-13T21:16Z,Did you try the Starforce3 trick with physically disconecting dvdrom uninstaling all emulation software exept for dtools v4?
,Felgard,2006-08-13T21:27Z,"i'we tried varius metods but it seems i was wrong about it being tages protected another sorce claims its ""protectCd 6.1/7.0"" or newer"
,Kheynom,2006-08-13T21:31Z,"Hehe, why not to try? Gimme a moment :D but IMO I don't think it'll help, cause as far as I know this protection is relying on ""twin sectors"", and that Starforce trick is working only with Starforce..."
,Kheynom,2006-08-13T21:36Z,"Yeah, It's a little confusing, cause in the root of this image are located two files - tagessetup.exe and tagessetup_x64.exe . So I decided its Tages."
,Felgard,2006-08-13T21:44Z,seems like you are correct sir. i been fooled yet again... well it gave me somthing to do for a cople a minutes till you reminded me of those files :)
,Kheynom,2006-08-14T00:47Z,"It's English version... I've installed it and everything is in English. Must be UK release, cause US version will be shipped 15th August according to official statement."
,Felgard,2006-08-14T00:48Z,well the movies are in english so i guess the rest of the game are to if we just could get past the copy protection
,Churchills Dog,2006-08-14T04:26Z,is there anyway to modify the German crack and install it for this?
,MaksiuWoW,2006-08-14T08:04Z,For a working copy of this software you have to make a data position measurement
,DaDDeh,2006-08-14T15:40Z,Just got a DEV (Ascaron) tell me that the UK/US version does infact use Tages as copy protection.
,SDude,2006-08-14T16:46Z,Because no one knows ( well most of us ) how to make a TDF file for TETRIS will just have to wait for one of the major scene groups. Well people guess who's gonna crack this first :). My money goes on reloaded.
,Dancingwind,2006-08-14T19:33Z,doeas anyone know how long does it take to crack a game? like after how many hours/days a crack usually appears? 
,SDude,2006-08-14T19:49Z,"I say 8-48 hours ;). Because this is tages itll be 100% cracked. CDV will use tages. So Reloaded, Deviance and so on. Will crack this one in a matter of time. Well it happens on the first day the game is released ( that is if they manage to get it ;) )."
,SDude,2006-08-14T19:52Z,Hmmm soon should be today ;).
,Dancingwind,2006-08-14T20:01Z,:) that's great ... well i must say that I feel a little guilty when good games get cracked in ... 1-2 days. And extremely bad when they get cracked 2 weeks before release.
,Dancingwind,2006-08-14T20:04Z,by the way ... how do the very first cracks spread? torrent? ed2k? website (like gamecopyworld)?
,Dancingwind,2006-08-14T20:27Z,I don't know if it's apropriate here but ... DON'T START any cracks you dload from ed2k or similar networks without an fully updated and active anitivirus and a firewall. There is already a bunch of razor1911 crack-imitations with a virus.
,DaDDeh,2006-08-14T20:33Z,"Well the US version was released today, and still no sign of a work around (nocd crack)."
,Kheynom,2006-08-15T01:16Z,"Nope, not working. I've got splash screen and then my PC stucked... :)"
,DaDDeh,2006-08-15T01:44Z,The german nocd/crack won't work with  the UK/US version as the german version used protectcd v7 and the UK/US version uses Tages protection.
,Kheynom,2006-08-15T01:48Z,"Yeah I know that, but I'm desperate, and I'm trying everything :D"
,SDude,2006-08-15T06:48Z,"15th of august ;). Godamnit no crack yet..... Don't worry people it's tages 5.5 its cracable it's only a matter of chinese.... i mean time. 

And PS: Dont use azureus when you play a game when you exit the game the pc craches... Remove Azureus ;)... But ofcourse try it out yourself with a game."
,SDude,2006-08-15T06:50Z,Sosseres so do it then ;).... And share... Go into hex editor and edit the Tages Image and it should work... I just don't know how and someone has to have an original cd to figure out what to change.
,Dancingwind,2006-08-15T13:46Z,48h+ and no crack. I think there was mentioned a bug in the game ... something about performing dvd checks and therefore degrading fps from time to time. If that's so then it seems that dvd checks are performed within the game and ... therefore potentionaly much harder to crack.
,weedjams,2006-08-15T15:48Z,"1395 peers, 29 seeds and I'm getting 14k/s avg over last 16 hours. wth?"
,Dancingwind,2006-08-15T16:10Z,no crack no rush :)
,SDude,2006-08-15T18:12Z,Like i said its tages either a TDF image... Noone in the public knows how to make TDF.... Or a crack ;)..... Thisll be a matter of time... Come on reloaded my cactuses for you bah..... CRACK DAMN YOU ;).
,buzz_uk,2006-08-15T19:32Z,last version of tetrris emu I tride (with Fahrenheit) didn't support 64 bit operating systems.  Whoever cracks this lets hope they make it x64 compatible. 
,Felgard,2006-08-16T08:38Z,"has anyone tried the demo trick whit this?

installing the german version and then copy all the englis voice and movie files from this installation and the use the english patch thats floting around?"
,DaDDeh,2006-08-16T18:23Z,Ascaron have just released the 1.2 patch for english version and US version which stops the diskseeking all the time so maybe now we will see a nocd/crack ?
,Dancingwind,2006-08-16T19:14Z,"As long as there wont be any other patches :)
v1.2 in ..3 days? Theres no point to make a crack if there is a new patch every day"
,SDude,2006-08-16T19:59Z,There is ;) If the game is playable... as far as i know 1.2 patch made the game playable again.
,IceMaster,2006-08-16T20:52Z,"There won't be a patch every day.  The discs are pressed well in advance of launch day, and the patch has been in the works since then."
,DaDDeh,2006-08-16T21:24Z,"V1.2 patch was only been in the works since UK/US release (11th/14th August) it was made to stop the diskseeking/checking The v1.1 Full game was doing it did this as part of the diskprotection (Tages), so we still need a nocd crack before we can play it."

,Durpius,2006-08-17T01:12Z,So.It has been cracked by Reloaded.But it seems you have to download all game because I cant find only crack.If anyone will find it please post a link here or make a torrent of it.Thank you!
,DaDDeh,2006-08-17T01:26Z,"So it's been released wheres the URL for the download please, i'll download the full version again. :)"
,Durpius,2006-08-17T02:05Z,"I'am terribly sorry.I found where to download and started to, but it seems it's a fake.But if theres nfo ( http://www.nforce.nl/index.php?switchto=nfos&menu=quicknav&item=viewnfo&id=105933 ) there should be a game too.Or I can be wrong again."

,bensson,2006-08-17T10:48Z,"It would be lovely if someone will seed ""only"" RELOADED crack files for this game... thx"
,Akillez01,2006-08-18T15:05Z,Seed!!
,project6,2006-08-18T22:17Z,"Sorry to pop your balloon, but TAGES cannot be cracked at this time."
,IDontCARE,2006-08-19T10:43Z,From what the developers of Tages are saying http://www.tagesprotection.com/main.htm we might never have the pleasure of playing Darkstar One UNLESS we buy the game... same goes to any other Tages protected games... i wish luck and the best to all the scenes out there maybe one day they will figure out how to whoop those punk bitches from Tages and crack this shit up... until then the only way to convince game developers NOT to implement Tages on their games is to refuse to buy ANY game that those fuckers from Tages put their claws on
,IDontCARE,2006-08-19T10:45Z,"Personally i say fuck Darkstar One, fuck Ascaron and fuck any game,developer that chooses Tages.

But most of all FUCK TAGES "
,Lurker85,2006-08-20T15:13Z,I tried the crack and patch 1.2 and everything but it didn't work so now I just bought the game at www.cdwow.com for nearly half the price found in the stores! Plus it's free delivery! Have a nice day =)
,daklab,2006-08-20T15:36Z,"idontcare: you are just stupid, you get angry at people because they have managed to protect their software from theives like you???

what are you? an immature spoiled little brat! that is what you are!"
,IDontCARE,2006-08-21T08:59Z,"Daklab: 
It seems that on every blog, forum, etc. there will always be a dumb jerk such as yourself to pick on people for no goddamned reason or right... up until now i have always bought the original of a game if i liked it... i just prefer to download the game 1st for 3 reasons: 

1. Most game do not deserve to be bought, i download a game and check it out, if i like it, i will always buy the original to support the developers... however if i didnt like it il just move onto the next game assuming i have time for it...
2. Its hard to buy originals here in Romania... lets say that all the games that came out in US or Europe this week, will only reach the shelves of our shops here in maybe 6-8 months if were lucky... im not that patient..."
,IDontCARE,2006-08-21T08:59Z,"3. I have 2 5yo boys and if im not able to make copies or download a game it would mean il have to hand them the original CD/DVD... lets get real here... 2 5yo boys + Original CD/DVD = one scratched and maybe even destroyed CD/DVD... so no thank you...

As for the calling me a thief part... dude... do you know where you are? thats right youre on www.piratebay.org... were ALL thieves here mate... otherwise there wouldnt be any reason for you to be here now would there? like it or not YOU are a thief just like the rest of us.. judging by your comment id say youre a dumb one too thinking youre o so high and mighty superior... some of us will decide to buy the original to support the developers and some wont, thats piracy for ya... in conclusion: please do us all a favour and judge yourself before judging others would ya? thank you.

anyways... a wise man once said ""every lock has its key"" New Tages info: 1:1 backups possible with trick ?

,Ravenmeister,2006-09-05T20:51Z,"well, when i installed this darkstar one this happend:
1. all my shortcuts on my startmenu/quicklaunch has been edited.
2. gotten 2 folders. data\resources\ (hidden)
3. there is a .exe file (hidden) wich run the original .exe file.
4. wierd connections to port 13 and 80 from programs without icons and same name as applications that are running.

id say its a trojan there."
,-___-,2006-10-03T06:21Z,"I love this game, and was perfectly willing to buy it after trying it.
Tages screwed all that up.
Now, not only will I not buy it, I will make doubly sure never to buy games with such oppressive copy protection measures. I'll wait for a better no-cd. Spite can be a bitch, as i'm sure they'll learn."
