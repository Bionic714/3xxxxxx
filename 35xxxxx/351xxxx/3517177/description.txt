While cinemas are working to deliver us a better moviegoing experience, quite a few of us seem to be perfectly happy watching dodgy copies of movies downloaded directly to our PCs.

Clever file-sharing technlogoies like BitTorrent have allowed online movie sharing to flourish. It's reckoned half a million films are traded every day in the darkest cloisters of the 'net, the so-called darknet.

The perpetrators are the new, 'net savvy generation who laugh in the faces of those who say copyright is theft. Often they're simply bent on getting something for nothing, but some get off on the thrill of metaphorically slapping the Hollywood suits down in the way they did the music industry behemoths.

Hollywood is clearly unhappy, and in amongst the public education campaigns, its defence of its intellectual assets has been robust. Tinseltown is sharpening its knvies and wheeling out its even sharper legal eagles. In practice this has meant action against everyone from movie sharing indidivuals, BitTorrent search engines, the Internet service providers hosting them, and anyone else who's deemed to be threatening their profits.

But could there ever be peace between Hollywood and the hackers? We tracked down the two most powerful voices on either side of the divide and asked them about their own philosophies, and what they thought of their opponent.

In the red corner: John Perry Barlow, lyricist in the US band The Grateful Dead. More pertinently, he went on to co-found the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the pressure group that's placed itself centre-stage in the fight to keep the digital copyright cops at bay.
