Btw. its a great game, I love zorklike humour. Its better (and wackier) than Hitchhikers Guide to Galaxy :)"
,Zorcher,2006-08-08T18:25Z,"Actually, this DVD I own is one I got with a special deal included with a Gateway computer I bought.  This DVD version does not contain Zork Nemesis like the actual DVD does, but it does contain all the content on one DVD.

However, there seem to be some heavy DVD decoder requirements to run the movies in high quality, but even if you don't, it should run as the CD version has."

Zorcher is in holiday?
Zorcher=asshole?

Zorcher=banned?"
,Zorcher,2006-08-21T04:18Z,"I must apologize for the late comment.

I did recently lose my hard drive that hosted this file and the image file itself.  When I reinstalled Alcohol 120% on another computer, it completely refuses to remake the image file.  It stops at 0% and calls it done.

Until I can solve this problem, I can't send.  I don't know what to do.  :("
,Zorcher,2006-08-21T07:50Z,"There, finally got the image recreated.

Again, sorry for the lack of seeding lately.  It should  be up now."
,Greyson,2006-08-23T02:42Z,"how do you get this to work? every time i try to play the game, it says insert dvd. ive dried daemon and alcohol and theyre both a no go"
,Zorcher,2006-08-23T03:25Z,"This DVD is too old to have any encryption of any type on it.  I'm assuming it's looking for the DVD in the first drive, it only uses the first DVD ROM drive it finds.  Try burning the image and using your physical drive or remove the physical and switch the daemon drive to your default."
,Zorcher,2006-08-25T03:38Z,"I would appreciate it if any downloaders would leave some comments.  You did wait 9+ days for me to seed the damn thing, plus a few more to actually download the whole thing.  =P

Is it working?  Having fun?"
,providen,2006-08-26T22:15Z,"Zorcher, you the MAN !

I've been looking for the DVD version for 8 months now, on torrentsites, on DC and nada.
And now: wooohooooo !!!

I am not done yet, so can't tell how it worked, but I guess an alcohol clone can't go wrong."
,Zorcher,2006-08-30T06:34Z,"I've done some research and the reviews say that the Zork DVD requires certain codecs to play those videos well.  However, those codecs really don't exist anymore.  Do you remember during install that it said the movies would play using standard quality because a DVD decoder wasn't found?  There's nothing really that can be done about it, sorry.

The codecs aren't offered on the DVD, which seems pretty pointless to me, but if you do some searching, maybe you could allieviate the problem."
,Zorcher,2006-09-08T22:35Z,Thank you for the post.  I'm sure that will be a big help.  :)
,Temptation,2006-09-10T15:43Z,"anyone have Zork Nemesis ?  

Zorcher, someone uploaded ""Journeyman 2"" a few days ago... but it was the normal CD version.. I know you mentioned the DVD version in your comment above, but I just thought I would let you know in case you were looking for any version.  I'm not sure how much better the DVD version would be for an older game anyway."
,Zorcher,2006-09-15T17:23Z,"I got em, thank you."

,KWP,2006-11-18T15:42Z,"Is this working for you guys? I just cannot make it work. When I try to install, a message says ""Unable to load a necessary bitmap"", and then it quits. I tried to mount it with Daemon Tools, and Alcohol. Tries to turn the regional preferences to English. I even tried to install under Windows 98, but it does the exact same thing.

Can anybody help me with this problem?

Thanks a lot.

,emalog,2007-02-06T18:06Z,"Hi!
I've finally downloaded Zork and have left it to be seeded.  Unfortunatelly, I have the same problem as Grayson.  I've tried to start the game with Alcohol 120% but it keeps telling me to insert the DVD...  Help pls...  I've waited for this for a long time (Zorcher, thanks heaps), and I don't know what to do now...  :-(("
,bol247,2007-06-27T17:01Z,"Hi everyone, emalog in particular, i've had some troubles with this and found some things to work around the problems, which I'm wanting to share to save someone else a future headache.

I admit i wrestled with this file for half of this evening trying to get it to work... First alcohol wouldn't recognise it, then the DVD wouldn't burn... eventually alcohol caught up and I could at least mount the game to the virtual drive.

So then i tried to install, and it crashed partway through.  Solution: go to ""my computer"" and find the virtual drive, (in my case, J:\), right click, and ""explore"" the drive.  Should open a folder of the game files.

Find ""setup.exe"", right click it, go to properties, then on the compatibility tab select ""run this program in compatibility for windows 98/ME"" or something like that.  Click ok.  After that, it should install fine.

Next problem - it installed fine, but refused to play.  Would ask me to install the DVD in the drive - naturally, I don't have it.  I can't burn DVD's, and from what i'm seeing online, even if you do burn a dvd, it doesn't necessarily mean it's going to work (most times it apparently doesn't).

SO, for emalog and anyone else experiencing this problem, you need to copy the files to your hard drive and then tell your game files not to look for a DVD.  (Need about 3gb space on your HDD.)

Go to C:\program files\activision\zgi_dvd (your newly created zork folder) and create a new folder here, call it 'DVD'.

open the virtual drive that alcohol uses (in my case, J:\) with explorer.  Copy the contents of the zork virtual dvd, and paste them into C:\program files\activision\zgi_dvd\dvd (the folder you just made.)

Next, in C:\program files\activision\zgi_dvd find the inquis.zix file, open it using notepad.

Replace the first part of the inquis.zix file with this:

007575
0 C:\Program Files\Activision\ZGI_DVD\DVD ' Zork Grand Inquisitor DVD

,useresq,2008-08-30T11:06Z,"Downloaded. Didn't take very long actually. I've done everything everyone has suggested and it's still not running. It's installed; it's running from the hard drive instead of the virtual drive; it's running in Windows 98 compatibility. I downloaded the MPEG-2 decoder.

And it's still working like crap. I can run the program, but all I get is a black screen with the pointer and access to ""restore"" ""prefs"" and ""quit"". ""Restore"" and ""prefs"" crash the program. ""Quit"" works properly, lucky me. That anyone would say this works beautifully completely baffles me.

What's anyone suggest? Thanks."

thanks alot dude!  Your method of installing worked perfectly for me! "
,Payne010,2008-12-21T21:44Z,"For those still having trouble with this game, I found a way to make it work.  The site Woof_Wuf posted has almost all the answers, but it still didn't work at first for me.  I tweeked the theory a little bit and got it working.  The way I did it is where the site tells you to copy this line: 

C:\Program Files\Activision\ZGI_DVD\DVD

to replace:

g:\..

instead, do that, but DO NOT add the DVD at the end.  Instead, where it's telling you to change the CD0: lines to lines like:

CD0: zgi\zgi_e\zgi_mx
to
DIR: .\DVD\zgi_e\zgi_mx

change them to lines like this:

DIR: .\DVD\zgi\zgi_e\zgi_mx

Keep that first ""zgi""

After that, go into the ZGI directory (the real one, not the DVD folder you just made) and right-click on ""zgiwin"" and go to Properties/Compatibility and change it to Windows 98.

My theory is that because of the way the site was changing the log, it had DVD in the directory to search, and then it was looking for another folder called ""DVD"" within that directory and couldn't find it.  This way, it searches for the DVD folder only once, and then gets all its information out that way.  Those were the changes I made and it works perfectly.  Hope this helped, and enjoy a great game!!!"
,nassik,2009-01-19T11:18Z,"when I mount the dvd (from physical or virtual drive)

This DVD has never given me any of the problems that anyone has suggested, but when the drive letters are not ""normal"", IE, D: isn't a CD-ROM, it's another Hard drive, then it starts to cause issues.

Downloaded and finally got running on Win 7 (64bit) using methods shown here - thanks guys ;)
Only problem I have is, the game is TOO fast. When turning left and right, the scenery just zooms by. I can slow down by controlling with arrow keys, but this makes for very annoying gameplay. Panaview turned to slow as possible in options. 
Anyone else having this problem, or know of a way to slow down the game?

,halofubar,2011-11-15T01:51Z,"Best bet for anyone running Windows 7 is to get the ""GOG"" version of the game, which has been revised/revamped to work properly on newer Windows operating systems.

You can go to http://www.gog.com/en/gamecard/zork_grand_inquisitor for information and to buy the game, or just search for ""zork grand inquisitor GOG"" to find it for download."
