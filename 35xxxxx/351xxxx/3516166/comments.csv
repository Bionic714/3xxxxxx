,NeverRAR,2006-08-27T22:02Z,"I will have to stop seeding this for a while, but at least it has a 5.972 in availability.

I will start seeding again in a couple of hours."
,NeverRAR,2006-08-28T07:13Z,"OK, I'm back now. Hope that didn't slow down the speeds too much."
,oceanofdarkstars,2006-09-08T10:03Z,"Hey Could Someone Maybe Mail this To Me Seeing As How I Have The Crappiest Dial-Up Con. Email Me If U Can. Do U Know How Long I've Been Looking For Just this Thing. Too Long.....Oh yeah The Email: Oceanofdarkstars@yahoo.com 

I'll Be Willing To Mail U Anything I Have"
,NeverRAR,2006-09-08T12:27Z,"oceanofdarkstars,
After laughing uncontrolled for about an hour, I'll give you the answer you need:

1. Most e-mail providers don't allow files over 10MB's to be sent as attachments, this is 10GB's.

2. Even if someone sent it to you as an e-mail, it would force you to download it from the slow mail-server instead. So there wouldn't be any point at all to do so.

3. Torrents can be resumed, shared between multiple people at the same time and it's a lot faster, easier and more sane than sending anything at all over 10Megs by e-mail.

I'd recommend you get yourself at least a DSL connection, which you can get pretty cheap nowdays since there's a lot of competitive providers."

,mdking,2006-11-18T21:46Z,i think oceanofdarkstars was asking someone to snail mail it to him/her on a dvd
,NeverRAR,2006-11-20T15:12Z,"mdking,
What? Are people still using that? I thought it was extinct. :D
Anyways, maybe I got it wrong, but since he put his e-mail there I figured that's what he meant."
,zake88,2006-11-30T19:43Z,Is this cartoon?
,NeverRAR,2006-12-01T22:12Z,"zake88,
No, this is the BBC television series (1988-1990).
Please check the IMDB link next time.


EVERYONE,
I will start seeding this again for a while soon, since I see there's only 1 seeder. Unfortunately it will take me a few days before I'm able to begin seeding."

,1melvis,2007-11-16T18:09Z,"Hej:til alle.
Glem alt om langsom email man kan sende ubegrænset mængder af data over www.sendlargefile.com
det er nemt og hurtigt og man kan benytte maximum båndbredde.
Så hvis nogle skulle være så venlige at de ville sende filen til mig så er min mail adresse jkm-foto@mail.dk NB. hvis man vil sende filen til flere end 1 person så behøver man kun at oploade den 1 gang."
