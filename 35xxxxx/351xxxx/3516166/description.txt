I skipped making a .nfo for this, so I'm just putting some info here instead:

IMDB Links:
Season 1: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094500/
Season 2: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096681/
Season 3: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098912/

This contains all three BBC series with nordic (Swedish, Norwegian, Danish, Finnish) subtitles.
It's "shrunk" from the originals to fit on regular DVD-R/+R discs, so the quality is somewhat reduced. I don't remember the exact figure though.

Enjoy!
