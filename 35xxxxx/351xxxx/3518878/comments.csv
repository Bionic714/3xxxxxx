I've installed it on four different computers, and it works fine.

Btw please seed after you. The file is so small anyway."

that's true, tho it is leased out to Norman as a part of their Internet Security package.

Btw sorry about the misleading version number. It's obviously supposed to be 1.06 as that's the name of the latest version."
