"Norman Ad-Aware scans your system for adware and spyware (Malware) and removes them. Malware is a generic term that encompasses a range of computer software that is designed and used to either harvest specific information from user machines for the purpose of marketing, or to display advertising messages and banners either within existing Web pages, or in Pop up boxes. These types of applications are sometimes legitimate, however the methods by which they are installed to your machine are often questionable, and on occasion they will be installed without your knowledge.

Norman Ad-Aware?s real-time scanner (Ad-Watch) protects you against such malware before it has been installed and reports every serious registry manipulation."
