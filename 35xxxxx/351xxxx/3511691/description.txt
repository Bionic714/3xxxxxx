The case cover front is the official release and the back is custom made. The dvd labels are custom made.

This collection is what I included with my DVD release of Doctor Who and have compliled them in this file for those who were just looking for covers. I also took the liberty of fixing mistakes and adding consistancy.

The only big exception is for Volume 5. The release I included with the DVD was entirely custom made but the cover in this file now contains the official front release. The back is still the same.


Enjoy!
