It's really great to see this series as it was never shown - even in the Johnny Sockko format -  in my country - Wales- or indeed I think any of the British Isles. I'm mostly used to seeing Ultraman from this period so it's great to see something from a different studio - some interesting Kaiju, but my vote so far goes for episode 5's Giant Claw - very striking visually ! I've done my best to seed the 1st 13 for the last 2 weeks - I've just had to burn them off to free up some space, but I'll do my best to keep the 2nd lot of 13 up for as long as possible - at least a week or two again. So thanks again for a really great upload - it is most appreciated ! My only request would be if you could repost episode 2 sometime - for some reason my download  of that is stuck at 85.7 %, and it's the only one I've missed. I could probably finish it off in a few hours or so, and them I could leave it up for a few weeks for anyone else whose missed it - I can see at least 3 others in the same boat as me ! Anyway, thanks yet again, and I'm really looking forward to the last 13 shows ! Best wishes - John"
