,Halbermunken,2006-08-15T22:41Z,PNAC is imperialism and terrorism can't be won by military means since once you use the military you are in effect participating in it.

,rhclayto,2006-08-16T23:50Z,"If 'wmarcy01' ever heard Chomsky lecture at MIT, it was some time ago, since he's been professor emeritus (retired from teaching) for quite a while now.  He also never heard Chomsky lecture on politics: he is a professor of linguistics--by far the most important linguist, perhaps philosopher or scientist, of the twentieth century--not of political science.  Plus it's obvious from the quality of his writing alone that 'wmarcy01' is unlikely ever to have made it into a university the caliber of MIT.

Aside from all that, he seems to think it's some sort of blasphemy to 'hate America', whatever that means. Chomsky might be said to hate militarism & plutocracy, but then, so do all right-thinking persons. It's hardly his fault that the US is governed by those philsophies."

,yannisath_21,2006-08-27T01:55Z,WELL SAID rhclayto!!!to avoid repetition...
,almalena,2006-10-05T19:56Z,"wmarcy01: ""There is not a bigger hater of America""

Well, he lives there, works at MIT, educates there and still hate america...

I would say that he loves the Big Corrupted land but despise their politics, which is veeery correct to do since the US government are murderers that profit from violence and greed, a true lover of USA do not approve of such atrocities made by it's own government.

He wants change to save the people in the land not to kill it.

BTW you are a stupid retard apparently.

Loving a country does not mean loving it's government, but I guess that you think that patriotism is about raving flag waving and loving murderers..."
