,potatodemon,2008-05-28T09:03Z,"Schopenhauer, thank you so much.  You make would make your namesake proud."
,MaureenCaudill,2008-09-02T01:37Z,"Appreciate the contribution because I've personally discovered that only reading his books doesn't do it for me, so getting this from various sources on various formats should hopefully make this stuff seap into my brain. I really recommend the kosmic consciousness interview from 2003, I really found that helpful to explain everything. Look forward to seeing this one. :)"
