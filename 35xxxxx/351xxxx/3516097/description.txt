
Ken Wilber is one of the modern worlds most read and translated philosophers, with 22 books allready published. He's been creating a great synthesis of western and eastern thought, of science and spirituallity. His aim is a integral theory of consciousness which combines knowledge from fields such as psychology, sociology, philosophy, mysticism, postmodernism, empirical science and systems theory. Many has tried to build something this and it all has turned to incoherent mess instead of a stable philosophical framework. If you are interested in philosophy, science and intelligent spirituallity this movie really should interest you.
