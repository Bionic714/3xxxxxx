,ptoner,2006-08-15T10:13Z,"well let me put a few things straight... u have clearly not  read anything by this man and have been listening to alot of propaganda, and like most people dont bother to find out the facts for yourself. The fact that people think he is a satanist (which he is not) is down to a number of factors. 
1. He wrote a book entitled ""the synagogue of satan"" which was about the current social and political issues at that time. He thought it was a ammusing title others did not. This caused people to think he was a worshipper of satan. Again they didnt bother to actually read the feckin book.
2. Other writings increased his nefariuosness. In another book Crowley wrote ""a male child of perfect innocence and high intelligenceis the most satisfactory and suitable victim for sacrfice"" Tjis was of course rubbish, Crowleys further statement that he had done this 100's of times only added. His detractors jumped on this and labelled him the most evil man in th eworld etc.. When in reality all he meant was to sacrifice oneself spiritually
3. In order to sell newspapers the tabloids had to have scandal didnt they so egits lap it up.

So why dont u download and actually read the material for yourself... better still go out and buy an autobio recently done by Martin Booth called ""A Magick Life"" which is unbiased and actually will  give you his almost complete background.

,ptoner,2006-12-19T11:54Z,typically listening to propaganda hence it scares people away from things that could do so much for them... why do u think he has such a bad rep? cause it sold papers at the time! doh same shit happens today even tho its alot worse!  also how can someone have an opinion on something if they havent even read about the topic... come on wise up!

,ptoner,2007-04-18T09:45Z,fair enough thats ur opinion Apfelstrudel... so the advice i give u is.. dont U download it! i think free will is important really.. enforcing ur personal beliefs/system on another is what causes the shit in the world today. 93/93

Ptoner thank you for the torrent."
,Retsol,2008-07-20T02:00Z,"This is wonderful. Just wonderful. Almost all of his writings. If you read any Robert Anton Wilson, and then any Christopher Hyatt your respect for Crowley will be sent through the roof. Crowley was first and foremost a spiritual adventurer and the primary theme through all spiritual adventuring is self-change; improvement of the self into higher circuits of consciousness. It is the healthiest and least understood of things.

It is cloaked in a lot of occult language and symbols for reasons I have never understood, but this stuff is primary primary knowledge. Thanks ptoner. Thanks so much."

,cockn1pples,2011-01-31T05:33Z,"His books seem to be much more illuminating when read from the actual book, but nonetheless this is a great reference collection.. cant argue with that. 

One of the most intriguing misunderstood florid writes ever to have reached such a magnitude."
