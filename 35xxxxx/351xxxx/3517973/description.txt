Axel has been a firm fixture in the German Melodic Hard scene. In the musical microcosm Axel Rudi Pell has always had everything in its traditional place, on the other hand he moves it continuously. If one had supposed that after the early 90's albums "Eternal Prisoner" and "Between the Walls" (at that time with singer Jeff Scott Soto) that Axel would have nothing more to offer, one quickly assured with the knowledge that Axel has always stood High Level Hard Rock. "Black Moon Pyramid", "Magic", and "Oceans of Time" cover the detailed possibilities of the genre, without crossing the line, but at the same time remaining interesting and entertaining musically, which is the trademark of the German / American band. The spring into the new century was made energetically and easily with "The Masquerade Ball", "Shadowzone" and "Kings and Queens". He's ready to rock again with "Mystica".
