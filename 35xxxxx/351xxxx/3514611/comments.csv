,dynasoar,2006-08-21T22:01Z,"Come on folks, please leave a note if you've got it all and will continue to seed. I'd love to keep this up myself, but I need to work."

,dynasoar,2006-09-30T20:16Z,"PLEASE NOTE: The song/file names on FA II are incorrect. Somehow the first song on II got named ""Chorale"". From then on all the song names got pushed down one: file 2 is The First Door (should be file 1), file 3 is The Second Door (should be file 2). Remove the name of file 1 on FA II, move all the names up one, and name file 13 ""Going To Another Place"", and all will be as the originals. I have no idea how this happened, as I didn't do this by hand."
,wotthe7734,2007-07-16T23:15Z,"I first heard Fresh Aire 3 a bunch of years ago (before CDs really took off) when I went to buy new speakers. About 2 minutes into it, I was hooked forever. (And I bought the speakers and album #2 - they were sold out of the rest.)

And you are so right - their Xmas albums can't hold a candle to the Fresh Aire albums. These are the Real Deal!

Now, if only someone will upload #s 5, 6, and 7...........

10-Q so 2 much!"
,Oldat49,2007-12-28T04:16Z,"I realize that it may be a bit of a chore (understatement) but could someone upload the other 4 of the series, as well as Classical Gas and any of their other albums?

[For Dynasoar, if you read this.. would you by chance have been selling your stereo equipment in New London, CT ..say in the early to mid '80s?
If so, I guess I'm one of those who fell into the ""bought equipment & fresh aire 1-4""]>>Audiophile records which someone working at UPS decided would look better in their collection than in mine. :(

Thanks very much for this and any future uploads!! "
,HomerJayJay,2008-12-28T20:05Z,"Thx for posting - excellent LPs, quality is superb

LMAO & small world, also sold stereos - moved many more copies of FAIII which was used for demos. That and Santana's MoonFlower which really gave the equipment a work out

Also hustled a lot of Graddo FPE+1 cartridges. Didn't cover the tutition but had a blast... 

Cheers/HJJ"
,TheP0sitive0ne,2009-04-23T09:00Z,"I'm in the process of Downloading this and have always wanted to get copies of their older work.  I was first turned on to Manheim Steamroller with their Christmas albums thanks to Rush Limbaugh when I listened to his radio show back in the early 90's.  I now own every one of the Christmas albums, and have seen the video of Fresh Aire 7 which I enjoyed a lot.  Chip is very funny and a genious with music.  Thank you dynasoar."
