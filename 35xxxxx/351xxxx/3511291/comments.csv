,bigben2k,2007-11-21T07:50Z,"Not sure if it's just me; I can play this, but I can't burn it; error in VOB file: Nero won't touch this. No subs."

Bullshit files! Single VOB (I) NO 2.3.4! Studio Canal then want you you to visit their website to buy the DVD! WANKERS! Get the studio file fakers out of here!

Fuck off mosmooth you spamming cunt. Its the real deal and a good film too."
,infin666,2008-12-11T00:21Z,"Good news: plays from hard drive (not burned to DVD) with PowerDVD v7.
Bad news: does not play with VLC 0.9.6 Grishenko. It craps out quickly. I tried various VLC commands (after immediately pausing to prevent failure) but everything I tried failed.
Although I did watch the whole movie with PowerDVD, it seems to be a flaky/braindead player, at least as far as going forward or backward to a different point in the film.
And there were a few places where video was jerky, and a few places where image was not crisp. Maybe the 3.85 GB size indicates that in fact it was compressed into the RAR archive, despite containing standard-seeming VIDEO_TS folder."
,redsparrow,2008-12-18T04:33Z,Not worth it if you want to play it on your DVD player because after a bit it starts to skip and you'll get an anti-piracy video. I was able to get it to play the individual VOB files from mplayer however.

Subtitles take up hardly any extra space. They also make for more seeders because the torrent is useful to more people."
