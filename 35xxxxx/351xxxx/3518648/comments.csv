[V],Barclay,2006-09-04T18:44Z,Va tror du den med versionen med svenskt tal hade ju biopremiär nyss. Du får vakert vänta tills den kommer på DVD i sverige.
,HenrII,2006-09-05T16:22Z,"Yo, Whitelow. Use another program for exempel WinDVD or Media Player. And the menu should work."
,chrillebanan,2006-09-05T22:39Z,"Någon som vet var man hittar svenska dvd etiketter nånstans... ?cd.covers.cc har jhu inget.. Är det någon som vet.. så hjälp mig pm:a mig så är ni as schysta 

Alltså etiketterna till skivorna.."
,_-KILL4FUN-_,2006-09-14T13:35Z,Tja! Någon som vet vad som hänt med http://covers.box.sk ???
,timmy81,2006-09-15T03:50Z,"Hey, I downloaded the movie..but there's a couple of problems im having...it doesnt not play any video..there is sound, but no video, and I can't get it to burn..How did you burn and put together this DVD? I have Nero and tried it and it said it successfully burned, but NOTHING was even copied to the DVD. What can I do to fix this problem? Any help is much appreciated. "
,Whitelow,2006-09-16T23:52Z,"I used DVD architect to put it together then Dvd shrink to get it into Iso. format. Then i used Dvd Decrypter to burn it out.

Dvd Decrypter is a freeshare program and has allways worked for me, so try it."
,rstanley,2006-09-25T08:02Z,can someone please be clear about the quality of this movie before I download?  Is it dvd quality or crap quality (anything other than dvd)
,rstanley,2006-09-25T08:03Z,I'm guessing it's crap since this movie isn't released in the U.S. till November.
,mary51shawn,2006-09-26T04:18Z,The quality is not all that bad. It is a little darker than the real thing...I downloaded and burned it for my kids and they love it! It was definatly worth it! Thanks a million!!!
,mary51shawn,2006-09-26T04:20Z,"Oh, and I forgot, there is a part in the middle of it where the audio is cut off for the movire theater to ask for the parents of so&so to come get there kid from the cossesion stand..LOL but other than that, its not all that bad."
,i-k.b,2006-09-30T12:58Z,Noen som vet om sider hvor man kan laste ned cd lablene? Takker for alle svar :)
,JMH53,2006-10-03T16:29Z,"The quality is really good on this one.  I used ImgBurn to put it onto DVD (a free program) and everything came out perfect - even the little menu screen.  The part with the theater breaking in for an announcement doesn't happen during a speaking part and it's only for 10 seconds or less, so it's not a big deal.  Definitely worth the time of downloading it!"

texningen! Den synkar bara den första hälften!
Det tar väl c:a 3-4 timmat att få det synkat bra?
Har testat med de flesta text programmen!"
