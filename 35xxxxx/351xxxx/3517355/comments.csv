,spiit,2006-08-31T14:43Z,"okey aXXo, im impressed. you are n1 in what you do."

,warpengi,2006-09-01T00:16Z,"This is Steven.King's.Desparation, some sort of biography or autobiography of Steven King, I guess.  Who wrote it?

I don't know why it bugs me so much but why do so many people label movies ""Steven King's, Clive Barker's, Adam Sandler's, etc?""  It sounds juvenile and like the above title is misleading as I'm sure this has nothing to do with Steven King being in despair.  Are there so many versions of this show that we have to label it Steven King's so that people don't get confused between the Coen Brothers' version, George Lucas's version and John Waters' version?  No.

oops...

just checked imdb and that is the AKA for the film in hte usa, land of all things stupid.  That explains it then."
,mark429,2006-09-01T07:16Z,"jackass if it weren't for the ""land of all things stupid"" you wouldn't have a computer, the internet, or 90% of all movies worth a damn

and why not give credit to the people who make these movies, I wouldn't know who the %^&* John Carpenter is otherwise. Please explain why it's juvenile to take credit for your work."
,mark429,2006-09-01T07:19Z,"AXXO- You are blowing TPB up man, keep up the good work!"
,Boosa,2006-09-02T11:43Z,"funny thing! I got this book in my appartment, but i never read it, well i read about 10 pages! But i have to say that the trailer looks pretty good. Problem= Read the book or download the movie? It would be cool to read, cause that i have´nt done in years, but then again, why waste 1-3 days on something you can get done in 1,5 hour! Keep up the good work pirates!"
,beridox,2006-09-02T17:42Z,"I really recomend the book, it is good. "
,Number999,2006-09-02T18:12Z,"@Boosa, read the book first and then watch the movie. The book is definitely worth the time."
,stiffmeisterr,2006-09-02T18:31Z,Thx aXXo your the man!!  or woman??
,latulipe,2006-09-02T22:21Z,the movie is definitely not even ridiculous
,bamsebiffen_88,2006-09-03T18:14Z,"will this fit to a cd??just wondering...cause i've downloaded video-files that have been around 730 mb and they have fitted to a cd, but this one is about allmost 800, so just wondering ;P

,X-piraten,2006-09-09T14:25Z,"killen äger , axxo a great guy , you are best ! allways great uploads :)"
,mark429,2006-09-11T19:02Z,"LegoLazze- I was just pointing out that without the US it is improbable that we would have the ability to use computers, watch movies, or have the Internet with which to freely trade warez of all sorts.  and to say the US sux is absolutely true is ridiculous. Sure some things about the states are bad and some are good but you can't deny that fact about any country and you also can't deny that without the ""stupid americans"" you sure as hell wouldn't be downloading movies onto your computer off of the internet because you wouldn't have computers,the internet, or (with some help from the french) movies to watch. Basically don't bite that hand the feeds you...."
,(-Zonkie-),2006-09-11T20:35Z,"Hi aXXo :)

Love the GREAT picture quality in your uploads, but PLEASE do NOT use 80kbps in the sound, the sound are terrible.

Sorry for saying this, LOVE all the uploads of aXXo. But the sound in a normal (about 192) is also important.

Sincerely (-Zonkie-)
[The one whit the OLD uploads]"
,pitamcpro,2006-09-14T16:10Z,Great upload! But the movie is a kind of boring!
,Marfere,2006-09-22T00:51Z,Thx for this up :D
,MrJurister,2006-09-29T00:46Z,"Great quality as usual for aXXo-stuff. The movie itself however... the title might as well have been ""Wonder how many times we can put the word God in a movie without goofing it up"". Stating the obvious; they crossed the line and broke the sound-barrier at the same time, just to be on the safe side.

And an remark to previous posts regarding the title. Many famous directors/writers/producers graciously ""loan"" their names to movies to make them sell better. Luc Besson and Jerry Bruckheimer for example.

Finally, coming from a generally secularized country (Sweden) these constant, rather typical american, references to God just strikes me as rather queer (not the in the gay-sense, just odd)."
[V],luca_turilli,2006-09-30T12:05Z,I like this movie :D the cop is my new idol!
,eloisa19,2006-10-04T06:04Z,help..am haiving a hard time downloading..when i double click ...download this torrent..another window at opera opens for the transfer..now when the double click all it shows is the website...thanks
,StreetSlick,2006-10-05T23:31Z,"Hey well i was having some problems too but i fixed it kinda.... Are you using Firefox or some sort of DL Accelerator all you gotta do is right click it and click on download ______ and than you should get the option to download. 

If not than sorry.
Something like this happened to me and this is how I got it resolved

,luca_turilli,2007-10-02T22:38Z,This is the best movie ever made!  the police is friggin´awesome
,jlivings10,2007-11-02T09:48Z,"eloisa19, your problems sound strange. For one you shouldn't have to double-click download this, and i don't get StreetSlicks comment either. You shouldn't have to right click either. Are you sure you have a bit torrent client? If not get it, this site is useless without one."
,jlivings10,2007-11-02T10:04Z,"eloisa19, your problems sound strange. For one you shouldn't have to double-click download this(click it once), and i don't get StreetSlicks comment either. You shouldn't have to right click either. Are you sure you have a bit torrent client? If not get one, this site is useless without one. Lastly, you guys are either using a browser I am unfamiliar with or you don't really have clue as to what you are doing. Using and problem shooting with bit torrent clients can be pretty technical so take some time to do some reading and figure what you are doing."
,esindrkhavi,2007-11-09T22:23Z,"About the title (again):

""Desperation is a horror novel by Stephen King. It was published in 1996 at the same time as its ""mirror"" novel, The Regulators. It was made into a TV movie starring Ron Perlman in 2006.""

He wrote the book under the name Richard Bachman. He used this pseudonym because at the start of his career the general view among publishers was that one book a year was enough.

Do a google search on Richard Bachman and you find plenty of information, including how a persistant bookstore clerk figured out who he really was.

I havent seen this movie and I'm not going to. I've read every book of King (and Bachman) and I have yet to see a movie version be up to standard (the exception beeing The Shining).

Cheers."
,ztreakmcgover,2007-11-20T09:43Z,Love you axxo! Tnx!
,darrellpotts,2008-01-29T20:33Z,"great movie, especially the part where all the doggies are lined up sitting pretty by the highway"
,SpiderGav,2008-04-29T18:33Z,"so esindrkhavi let me see if i get this right...you have no intention of downloading or watching this or any other stephen king movie.... so what are you actually doing here? u another one of these dl'ers who search for torrents just to leave comments? obviously nothin better 2 do with ur time
Thanx 4 the (yet again) quality dl axxo.....keep up the good work :P"
,devilishme98,2008-05-31T05:57Z,this is weak alway trojons in AXXO s work BEWARE
,nuGFX,2008-06-02T17:41Z,"@devilishme98

anyways aXXO is the only way to go, i put most my movies on my ps3 for watching and most files have to be converted when from other people. axxo rips always play and ALWAYS great quality."
,Roland115,2008-06-23T23:22Z,If you like the movie read the book and its sister book The Regulators same characters diffrent roles
,Emotron7,2008-06-28T06:10Z,"LOVE the movie, great torrent, thnx!"
,jingle_juice,2008-07-02T05:46Z,"this movie is absolute shite.  terrible acting, awful story and boring as hell.  this straight to video p.o.s. should have gone strait to the dumpster.  waste your time if you want but don't say i didn't warn ya."
,Overkill360,2008-09-19T16:47Z,"Great quality
movie itself was not that good"
,harigata,2009-04-29T13:20Z,"Mark429 - a few facts, dude: the American film industry ain't too hot. Having tons of money isn't the answer to everything. The French film industry, for instance, which produced so many films better than anything america's ever made was bought and smothered by you, and now produces unwatchable sugar-coated shite that only appeals to bovine americans, it seems.

As for all the other gifts your proud country has brought to the world - spare me. You're just the biggest bully on the block. The world was not ""in darkness"" before the invention of computers (by German scientists by the way), or before the advent of your particular take on liberty. And the fact still remains that the average american is just about the dumbest thing ever to have walked this earth.

Oh yeah - and your religious fundamentalism is disgusting. You're really not that different from fundamentalist muslims...."
,bullyooo,2010-07-18T19:11Z,VERY GOOD 
,aroyals,2010-09-16T15:07Z,"@ SpiderGav
shhh he was just giving a bit more info on the story & I would have found it interesting if I already know.

@ esindrkhavi
lol yeh how good/bad any of these movies are seems to come down to which director/actors screw it up the least"
,aroyals,2010-09-16T15:08Z,"^^if i DIDN'T already know...

TPB needs edit :("
,aroyals,2010-09-17T00:39Z,"oh god, this was even worse than i remembered!!
I remember why i deleted it in the 1st place lol

Still, just read the book again it had been 10 years since 1st reading so ty to the uploader

ALSO: It was ""The Regulators"" that he published as Richard Bachman not this, even tho it was long after he was exposed as a part of the whole desp/reg being the 'same but slightly different' thing"
,Rickslick,2011-10-23T13:17Z,Thanx =)
