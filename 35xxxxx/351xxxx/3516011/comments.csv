[V],Kuthumi,2008-10-06T07:17Z,"xMissAshleyx1389, this is the wrong place to ask help questions. This page is only read by people interested in this film. Click the Forum button below and register.
But: Yes, this IS the Video TS version. If you click '11' to the right of Files on top, you will se the contents with VOB, IFO and BUP files in a TS folder. You will see the same if you click 'Files' on the torrent in Vuze.
If you can burn a DVD with the Video TS folder, you can also burn other formats. Install Nero Burning Rom, or Google your problems like the rest of us."
