,eris276,2008-10-05T14:12Z,"hi guys, probably its my own fault but somehow i just got the sound going without any picture. this is all on windows media player. which update is required? i thought i had the new one, do i have to do anything special to get that going?
cheers"
,Spooky101,2008-10-25T04:08Z,"eris276, download CCCP. CCCP is basically VLC player inside Media Player Classic, its just a bunch of codecs. Once you download and install CCCP just watch the VTS_01_0.IFO file with media player classic. imo, CCCP is way better than VLC ^^.
