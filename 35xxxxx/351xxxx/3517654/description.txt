This is the DVD Rip of Vabank that was floating around the internet and stopped at 98.8%.  I downloaded up to the 98.8%, un-rarred the files (allowing it to un-rar corrupt files) and used MediaFixer to fix the movie so we can at least see it.  Thus, there is 2.2% of the movie in which you won't see.  These parts have been cut out.  I'm sorry, there's nothing I can do to help with this part!  I have no idea what the movie is about since I don't speak Polish (boyfriend does, I'm just learning).  So...  I at least got everyone this much of the file.  Try to enjoy!!!
