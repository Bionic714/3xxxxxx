,William Thorpe,2006-08-26T21:21Z,"Hmm Im new to this :)
Which format should I use then?"
,Massmordaren,2006-08-26T21:21Z,Why not? It's a superior format for files at this size.
,William Thorpe,2006-08-26T21:31Z,"My translation from russia to english will be finnish very soon. I use a translation program so all text are little odd, but every dialog will be in english... better bad english then in russia. :)
So within a couple of hours it will be finnish.
Hope all downloaders will enjoy it, I did so far :)"
,William Thorpe,2006-08-26T23:23Z,"I finish my translation a sec ago. 
Age of Pirates Translation.
Enjoy!"
,William Thorpe,2006-08-26T23:52Z,"If you change language.ini your mainmenu screen gonna be fucked up. Better to copy english content into russian folder. Thats my experiance btw :).
I added instruction in my file how to do it, so there should not be any problems then."
,William Thorpe,2006-08-27T19:40Z,"OK!! :)

,William Thorpe,2006-08-28T03:55Z,"Knaster!?
Did you edit all dialogs to perfect english or do mean just all menus?"
,intetnetrage,2006-08-31T17:46Z,i applyed your stuff and now my game crashs before it gets to the menu.
,William Thorpe,2006-09-02T03:48Z,"Alright Intetnetrage.
