Alright here we go again, the last torrent was corrupted (I think) so here's a new one.

----------

A fusion of historical drama and mystery, this provocative new series focuses on the effects of World War II on the villages of England's vulnerable southern coast. As the war heats up in Europe, police inspector Christopher Foyle (Michael Kitchen, "Reckless", "Our of Africa") is prevented from enlisting by his superiors who need his talent at home. Foyle is an everyday detective, waging war against local crime in an atmosphere suffused with extraordinary personal and social turmoil.

I'm uploading this and will upload the second series when this torrent have enough seeds as I only have 0.5Mbit. It would be really nice if someone could upload series 3 and on. I can't find it anywhere.

I know the description isn't good but I'm to lazy to write something myself (It's from the back cover.)
