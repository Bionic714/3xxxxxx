'Point North' was the best album I had heard from a newcomer so far in 2006 and with 'Timecode' Uwe has proved that this was no fluke. A lovely deep bass sequence kicks the title track into life. It increases in pace still further as more sequencer lines are added, one being quite melodic, also taking the lead line role whilst the other is quite percussive. Everything combines together to form a captivating brew. What an opener! 'Continental Drift' combines an excellent slow bass sequence with soft 'Tron' sounds. Things build majestically with the addition of first another sequence then a rhythm until we are motoring at quite a pace, added excitement coming in the form of some very good melodic embellishments. Another real winner, probably even better than the opener.

'Metamorphosis I ? III' clocks in at seventeen minutes but doesn't have any individual index points between the three parts so I will review it as one slab of music. Unlike the opening two tracks we start moodily. Atmospherics gradually give way to a warning beacon type pulse. These fade away as brighter sequences comes in then joyful bounding lead lines and foot tapping rhythms. It is all so infections I defy anybody to keep their feet or hands still. By the half way mark things have begun to be stripped back, developing a much moodier character. By the eleventh minute we have completely returned to atmospherics but excitement soon returns to finish the track in the same bounding upbeat mood as we started. 'Moon Chime' probably takes its name from the title of one of the 'voices' he uses as there is a sort of celestial sound used to one of the loops but whatever, it is another body mover with excellent infectious melodies and rhythms. There is a rather interesting twist in the third minute but overall completely undemanding to listen to but also 100% wonderful! 'My Turn to Eternity' is initially slow and moody but it isn't long before more superb beats and pulsations strike up. It is a little bit more restrained than some of the previous numbers but no less devastating. The interwoven melodies are particularly exquisite. This could very well be many people's favourite track on the album. 'Archimedes' starts with a combination of strings and bounding sequence that grabs you straight away. Then comes the melody played on first one lead sound then replied through another. It is simply fantastic and sticks in the mind so much it has been in my head ever since I first heard it. 'Frozen Colour' spends time building up the atmos, the mellotron sounds used being wonderful. It takes about two and a half minutes before things become more syncopated but even so this is fairly sedate stuff by comparison to the rest of the album but with a rather mean twist. 'Moonshine in The Garden' (Oh Heavens!!) is actually another track who's melody will stay with you long after the album has finished. It is an absolute delight, ideal for air keyboard playing, placed in an equally infectious rhythmic setting. 

Uwe is very much his own man but there are hints of Edgar Froese (especially Stuntman, Pinnacles and Ages) and Tangerine Dream in 'Exit' type mode, also maybe a little 'Underwater Sunlight' and touches of earlier TD as well such as 'Tangram'. Uwe combines all these elements together, along with his own natural exuberance in a completely irresistible mix of E-Newage Music.
