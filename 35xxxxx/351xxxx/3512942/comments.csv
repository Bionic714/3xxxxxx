,manndrine,2006-08-16T13:37Z,I would love to have subs... but I was limited with the software I was using when I made this. I'm in the process of learing a new prog that will enable me to include subs. So until then your on your own...

- You are getting a movie for FREE, and still u are complaining with your fu**ing swedish subs.. !? 
How about coming up with a better copy then - ungrateful fuck !"
,Windiez,2006-08-23T11:31Z,"I hate subs... And there are plenty of programms which you can use to add your subs by yourselves! I mean not everyone is swedish, some might want for example french or norwegian!"

,evilneuro,2006-09-25T20:31Z,"thanks for the efford manndrine

just some full disclosure for anyone downloading: this is in stereo lpcm, not dd2.0, 4:3 letterbox, not 16:9 widescreen, and since this is a dvd to xvid to dvd conversion, the picture is a bit soft.  I'd had spent more space on the disc for picture rather than adding a photo gallery and trailer, stuff you could download anyway :)

still, a good option for anyone wanting to watch on the tee vee without an xvid player."
,Davy91,2006-10-06T18:16Z,is this movie with subs?
,jensaaah,2006-10-10T01:20Z,"To Windiez:

Correct me if I'm wrong you dickhead, but isn't this a Swedish Torrent Site?

I'd like to citate Adv|sor:

""Ungrateful fuck !"" - USE YOUR OWN TORRENT SITES THEN WINDIEZ? "
,Windiez,2008-02-23T23:22Z,Every idiot monkey knows by now how to add subs and almost every idiot understands english so why the subs...
