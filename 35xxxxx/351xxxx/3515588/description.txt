Due to some complications with some bittorrent clients, I have volunteered to reseed this torrent for the original poster.

The original file can be found here: 

[url]http://www.demonoid.com/files/details/392464/5449812/[/url]

The only changes I have made is to add some trackers, and add a txt file to allow the file to be tracked by h33t as well as demonoid. also, the piratebay tracker is listed first, so they would accept the upload as well.

if you have any questions directly relating to [b]THIS[/b] torrent, please feel free to ask me, but if you have questions relating to the [b]CONTENT[/b] of the torrent, ask the original author, Piorel.

Below is a reprint of his original description:

[b]Quoting Piorel (italics mine)[/b]
[i]Here are over 2000 Wallpapers manually selected. I think this is the best - yet never to be complete - collection (Animals, 3D, Painting, Cars, Sports, Flowers, Games, Nudity but no porn!, Landscapes, Cuisine etc). This is my personal collection, I've been paying very much attention on selecting each wallpaper. Not last, resolution is 1280 x 1024 in 99,9%.

These wallpapers are only for personal use.

Please seed after snatching. My upload band is up to 600 KB, but I don't know how much longer it'll last.

Enjoy!  ;D [/i]
