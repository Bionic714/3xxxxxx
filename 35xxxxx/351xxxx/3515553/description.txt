Ivar Lovaas, co-founder and current Director of the UCLA Young Autism Project, developed these classic videotapes in 1981 as an important addition to the well-known ?ME Book? to demonstrate effective methods for teaching students with developmental disabilities (such as autism). These techniques are as important and relevant today as ever. The videotapes present valuable information on the learning strategies developed through the years for use with such challenged children.
As Dr. Lovaas himself demonstrates in the videos, early introduction to basic skills is critical in preparing children with developmental disabilities to confidently learn and interact with others.
