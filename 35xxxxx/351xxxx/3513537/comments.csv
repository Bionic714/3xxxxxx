for about 20 minutes?

Im assuming someone here has it. PLEEAAAASE

Im U/L at 5000k for this torrent alone, stuck at 99.6 percent with two other poor bastards

not to mention Im seeding this torrent too at the same speed

pretty please with sugar and bandwidth!?!?!"
,crazycalvin,2006-10-26T22:13Z,"Exactly the same problem as HeadHunter above. 

I have been looking forward to trying out OpenFalcon.

It doesn't seem to be working with the German version of Falcon 4.0 available here, and I don't have an English one with me. Did you ever get OF to work with the German version? Is there anything special that needs to be done?

Thanks for the help! Sincerely appreciate it."
,JohnnyWithmoore,2006-11-28T21:26Z,"Are there still any needs for full original Falcon iso (eng)

,T4,2007-07-03T14:39Z,is this Falcon 4.0 released in 1998 or is the latest allied force falcon?

,Soondead,2009-12-09T17:17Z,"Installed everything as per the .txt file, I can start the program but all mouseclicks outside of 640x480 go to the desktop so I can't click ""setup"", nor the airplane icon in the lower right corner of the screen."
