A couple of us have been stuck at 95.7% (100MB remaining) for a number of days. There are no uploads or downloads at the moment for this file, and my share ratio for it is still embarrassingly low :(

Are you going to seed this torrent again, or should we just cut our losses and burn what we have? It's /kinda/ watchable ...

Of course if I get the whole thing I'll keep seeding it, I just don't want to do that if it means more people get only 95.7% :)

Thanks!"
