Lets give some cheers for our latvian friends :)"
,npras42,2006-08-24T22:46Z,"Hmmm... is this not for v1.2? Everytime I play the game, everything starts to go blurry and sometimes the colours become negative. This isn't the most detailed .nfo I've seen for a Reloaded release!
I will try without installing the v1.2 patch and see if it works better."
,AzatoTh,2006-08-24T23:23Z,"I only tried it without the 1.2 patch, and that is good enough for me :)"
,johndmes,2006-08-25T06:25Z,"There is a missing folder from this archive - a CRACK folder that has the patch for the already-installed version.

In this archive is a patch for the ISO file.  Not for the already-installed one."
,AzatoTh,2006-08-25T11:28Z,"Ummm, dont know what you have managed to do, but this archive contaiuns both the Crack and the PPF folders..."
,Lord KiRon,2006-08-25T11:47Z,"Still not a good crack , textures become bluered from time to time.

I have original game too - does not happen there."
,Lord KiRon,2006-08-25T14:00Z,"OK, now it is ok - had to copy  original file with extension .org  too ...
it was not just for a backup :)"
,voltar,2006-08-26T14:36Z,kuva mela tady n?kdo ?esky
,Typooni,2006-08-27T16:19Z,"Yeah thisworks fine. Fixes blurred and fucked up Navigation window [N] and also makes it possible to make hyperspace jump to that one system where you couldn't jump before because Darkstar One just announced that ""there is some large objects closer than 4 units"" even if you were lets say about 20 units from nearest station or whatever. So thank you Reloaded for making this work and thank you for the uploader who distributed this to us. :)"
,Slimsoj,2006-08-28T00:03Z,THANK YOU Reloaded!!!
,Zigna,2006-09-04T23:47Z,"This crack works whit the 1.2 patch too, just rename the DarkStarOne.exe from v1.2 to DarkStarOne.org and replace it whit the one in the patch :)"
,Zigna,2006-09-04T23:54Z,even thoug it seams to crash whit this crack and v1.2 of the game...
,Hieyeck,2006-09-15T03:49Z,"Here's what i did:
1. Patch the ISO with that comes with this crack
2. Install like normal.
3. Extract the german patch to a working dir.
4. Copy ds_interface.cpr to the dir you installed to.
5. Use this crack.

The problems it fixed for me:
black-screen (with old patch)
post-processing filters (overbright, ghosting, other effects that might be confused with textures)
system map spazzed out "
,Kilerden_HELL,2007-01-14T13:52Z,How do you instal this game???
