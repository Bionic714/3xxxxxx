,meta4,2006-08-12T19:49Z,What ?? I´ve got 40 takers of this torrent  and nobody says thank you . Well - goodby TPB. U´ve seen the back of me.
,Lupillus,2006-08-12T23:24Z,"Dear Meta4, have mercy with our poor lesbian souls. I think everybody has been a bit nervous after the last raids at TPB and hasn't logged in and been able to write a comment. But thank you very much. We have indeed appreciated your effort and enjoyed the movies we have downloaded from you."
