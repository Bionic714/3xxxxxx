,martink123,2007-01-29T19:31Z,SHIT 
,martink123,2007-01-29T19:31Z,DONT DOWLOAD THIS FUCKING CRAP!
[T],WinstonSmith6079,2007-02-08T09:37Z,"HAHAHA!  How could you ""thinked"" that when it's clearly marked ""[1933]"", as in it's the great, classic original?  That's your fault, not the movie's.  I mean how could you be so dumb?  Maybe if you learn how to read, you won't d/l things that you don't want...maybe.

I think people who can read, know what this is, and want it are gonna d/l this as they have been already."
,Burroughs,2007-05-22T11:16Z,How does I seed/share a file that is already exicting? So that it will work faster for other people?
,Skogsmullen_89,2007-06-03T20:43Z,"OMG WinstonSmith
LEARN HOW TO SPEAK ENGLISH, PLEASE!!!
You write english as a 5 year old, fucking retard!!"
[T],WinstonSmith6079,2007-06-06T07:04Z,"Skogsmullen_89: My English is better than yours.  Anyone who can read can see that, you fuckin' pieceashit n00b!"
,Icarus78,2007-06-13T02:22Z,"I couldn't see any problems with Winston's language...maybe you mean martink's..
Cheers for the upload Winston"
[T],WinstonSmith6079,2007-06-16T09:01Z,"Thanks, Icarus78.  No problemo as I like uploading stuff.  More to come!  :)

Skogsmullen_89 uses more than one exclamation-point after a sentence and doesn't capitalize the word ""English"", but is stupid enough to criticize (badly) someone else's language.  It's he who writes like a fuckin' five-year-old.  What a dick!

No worries about him though: He's only capable of making moronic comments and uploads nothing at all.

,ellkay,2007-09-20T15:22Z,"Hey Winston, don't listen to martink/skogsmullen, they don't seem to know what the heck they're talking about. 

Thanks a lot for this movie, it's on my list of movies to watch (http://www.listsofbests.com/person/ellkay). Now I can watch it and cross it off the list, thanks to you!"
,zeinabqureshi,2008-03-14T16:51Z,"Really enjoyed the exchange of *words* (if one can call it that). As far as I know, this version here is the best available of the ORIGINAL stop-motion classic. And, to be sure, people who can't read better not download torrents.

Nice, sci-fi slanted collection you've got here, WinstonSmith! I've only recently came across these, you seem to be the man!

And I actually downloaded this more than 6 months ago...guess i enjoyed the comments even then... 
:-;"
,creatinghavoc,2008-03-26T14:09Z,"Looking forward to seeing this again, been a long time and i,m gratefull to the uploader. cheers"

,fluke42,2009-07-10T13:57Z,"finally i can call this classic mine!

thx for the up!"
,echoecho03,2009-09-08T01:28Z,but is this the rereleased b&w beauty or or the shit colorized one?
[T],WinstonSmith6079,2009-09-25T22:54Z,"echoecho03: This is the glorious original B&W version.  No shitty colorized version here, as the only one who seems to actually like colorization is Ted Turner hehehehe"
,Kjoe331,2009-10-06T20:59Z,I knew what I was looking for and found it! There is nothing like the original in good old Black & White. Thanks!!
,avago,2009-12-05T04:39Z,Audio out of sync.
