Towering Above The Rest
peace"
,Trui76,2006-08-23T08:15Z,"No, this is called Hovering Above the Tower because
it's made by ateasers to beat the audio quality of towering above the rest. Track list could be the same of towering above the rest, but that's just coincidence. "

Ive only just found them and would love a copy.

Many thanks."
,PhilJW,2007-08-09T21:00Z,"Please please please continue to seed......

Theres a load of us stuck at about 90% (mainly cos its downloading very slowly). Please could you seed just for a couple more days. 

Once I (and I'm sure the others) have completed it I'll seed it for the next week to ensure everyone can complete it.

This 4 discs are a fantastic set so I'd be very grateful if you could carry on a bit longer. 

Many thanks."

I mean Towering Above the Rest is immense but the audio is bootleg quality because it is one. Then this is an amazing collection, but FLAC is probably too much for the casual listener. I was thinking maybe there should be a compilation of all b-sides perfectly ripped as V0 MP3s in EAC, something like that. Then again, I could download these and just convert them pretty easily. Great upload anyway."
