The Hard part is getting & keeping the Girl ??????

Then Man up Get out there & Open that Fcuking Mouth & Talk. Tell her you love her shoe's... Lips.. smile. something to make her feel good.

Don't ask to buy a Drink. find what she drinks..with out asking & go get her one.

Ask her to Dance. 98% of Women love dancing. the contact of a Man making her feel good. & Feeling safe.

Talk to her. ask about her.. Do NOT talk about your self. Unless she asks you something.
Make her your Centre of attention..

Gees Bud.. Maybe you should be reading some                         """"""""  confidence Books  """""""" Once you find that with in you... you'll have your Girl... 



Good Luck "
