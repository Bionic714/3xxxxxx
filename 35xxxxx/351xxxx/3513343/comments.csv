,omniborg,2006-08-19T12:50Z,"This is going to be deleted from thepiratebay, to much hit-n-run and not a single appreciative comment. Thank you."
,mesb1973,2006-09-29T14:21Z,"Please don't. I've just found this torrent. I'm doing a subject at uni on the civil rights movement and this is absolutely perfect. 

I also never go below the 1:1 ratio. 

Thank you for uploading. "
,seacrest,2006-10-10T19:39Z,"This is re-running on PBS this month.
Otherwise I had forgotten about it.
Thanks for sharing."
,amecarilda,2006-10-13T07:40Z,Thank you for making this available.  I've been looking for a copy for years.   
,Sgt Pepper,2007-06-08T15:20Z,hey i registered just so I could leave a positive comment. Don't take this down!!!! Its important
,Sgt Pepper,2007-06-11T06:09Z,Can someone pleeeeaaaasse seed this?
,jesblah,2007-10-30T05:48Z,"Please, please, please seed and please don't remove from the pirate bay.  This is such an important piece of US history... I promise to seed in return once I have the entire collection.  Thank you!"
,srennie,2007-11-12T12:45Z,"Thanks for offering this important series. This should be a part of every school's curriculum. Surely there are groups out there with the money to buy the rights for the songs and clips in perpetuity for Blackside... Whats really blocking the re-distribution of this movie? The PBS Teacher's site within their online store still offers the series, but I'm not sure if they offer it to the general public. I'm in Canada anyway, and they don't ship here, although they seem cool with getting my contributions... Anyway, thanks again, for taking up a big chunk of your memory to make this available again. For other looks at those turbulent times, try reading James Farmer's book, ""Lay Bare The Heart""."
,DR-Crew,2007-12-20T05:20Z,"please keep this seeded....maybe one of the most important documentaries of all time

,sq0nk,2010-02-01T07:42Z,"Two pairs of episodes are mislabeled in this collection.

The first is ""The Keys to the Kingdom"" and ""Power!"".  That is the file that says that it is ""Power!"" is actually ""Keys"" and vice versa.

The second pair of swapped files is ""Back to the Movement"" and ""The Promised Land""."
