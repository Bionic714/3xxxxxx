Release notes: With the new masterpiece by the Danish Power Metal trendsetters, you get an intriguingly written concept album that takes you back in time, on a journey with a travelling circus in New England 1896.

The concept is an H.P. Lovecraft inspired horror story that is written as real letters from one character to another! Manticora has chosen to part ways with the normal way of writing lyrics, and have used the letters in this story as background for creating some very complex, yet characteristically Manticora-like and very listenable tunes.

In the first part of this 2 album concept, you?ll be dragged into the mysterious and dark atmosphere of The Black Circus, leaving you with a desire for more. A spellbinding story that takes its beginning on August 25th.

Part 2 of the concept will be revealed in spring 2007

Enjoy and please seed.
