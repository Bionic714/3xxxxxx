Take a musical cruise of the Mediterranean from melodic Spanish flamenco to joyous Greek rembetiko. Sit back, grab a glass of wine and enjoy! 
The Mediterranean is one of the most culturally diverse regions on the planet. Each of the four countries featured on this collection have unique histories, distinct cultures and languages, individual styles of art, food, literature, and, of course, music. Yet, for all the differences, there are many common threads that link the music of the northern Mediterranean. Influences from the Arab world, both historical and contemporary can be felt in every corner of the region. The echoes of Jewish culture have left their mark, from the Sephardic melodies of Spain to the Eastern European clarinet riffs that resonate in Greek tradition. Tinges of an ancient Celtic world can be heard in the music of nearly every country. And the wandering Gypsy minstrels passed through all corners of the Mediterranean, leaving an indelible mark on the style, instrumentation and attitude of music from Athens to Andalucia.
