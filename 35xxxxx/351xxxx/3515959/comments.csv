But the colors are strange. Black and white with a redish furnish and a green line in top of the picture. I have had similar problems with other moovies."

,everlander2007,2007-01-03T19:58Z,"The official story says that United Airlines Flight 93 went down in Shanksville, PA at approximately 10:06am on 9/11. At first, the ""Let's Roll"" story came out about passengers storming the cockpit to take control of the plane--causing the flight to crash. The Pentagon said the story wasn't true. Then speculation about whether or not it was shot down was raised, and that was dismissed right away. Interestingly, Rumsfeld later slipped while addressing the troops on Christmas, 2004 by saying ""shot down the plane over Pennsylvania"" in an apparent speech against terrorists.
Many eyewitness reports from that day include hearing two explosions. Some remember seeing a small white Leer-type of private jet that circled overhead for 1-2 minutes after the crash and then took off. Others recall a C130 flying overhead after the crash, as well as a fighter jet speeding by. The FBI at first denied that any other aircraft was in the area, but then came up with explanations for the white jet and the C130. They stated that the white jet remained in the area to help authorities know the location of the crash. The C130 had actually been dispatched to assist in identifying Flight 77 within minutes of it crashing into the Pentagon, and then was ordered to assist in locating Flight 93. Very odd...
The debris field of the crash of Flight 93 was spread over a 3-6 mile area.  At Indian Lake, 3-miles away from the ""official"" crash site, witnesses spoke of a ""rain of confetti"" after a loud ""boom"". The official site of impact didn't look like your typical airliner crash. Witnesses at the crash site said that there were no pieces bigger than just a few feet, and that none of the debris was recognizable of a commercial jetliner.  The Mayor of Shanksville, Ernie Stull, whose sister was first on the scene, even said ""There was no plane"". Reports did tell of body parts and clothing strewn about the 3-6 mile area, but the official crash site was basically a crater covered with aluminum flakes that looked more like an explosion had occurred there, rather than a typical crash, which consists of large pieces of aircraft wreckage including wings, engines, fuselage, & luggage.
So what really happened? Well, judging from the witnesses and information, it is OUR BELIEF here at GTC that the plane was shot down, which explains why the debris field was spread over such a large area. The blast crater that was photographed and inspected as the official crash site, we believe, was most probably made by a second round of artillery to give the appearance of a crash. How many lawsuits do you think would arise against the government if it was made public that they shot down a plane full of American citizens?

The morning of 9/11 a report came out from WCPO-TV that told of a plane being forced to land at Cleveland Hopkins Airport in Ohio at 10:45am. United Airlines had identified the plane as one of their own--Flight 93. The Mayor of Cleveland, Michael R. White, told reporters in a press conference that the emergency landing was due to concerns of a bomb on board, and that air traffic controllers heard screams as well. The flight held 200 passengers which remained on the plane after it landed, but were taken off by authorities a half-hour later. The airport and surrounding areas were subsequently evacuated. Later that day the original report was removed from the WCPO website. Luckily, local Ohioans were posting online reports of the news regarding this incident as they heard it that day on the radio and television.
Another plane, Delta 1989, was brought into the mix as well and was forced to land at Cleveland Hopkins at 10:20. The 69 passengers on that flight were evacuated after an hour and a half, only after the plane was surrounded then searched by the FBI. Passengers from Delta 1989 say that the plane was basically quarantined at the airport until 12:30pm when they were taken off the plane and brought to the FAA headquarters for questioning. According to witnesses, the 200 passengers from what was reported as Flight 93 were taken to the NASA Glenn "

,bigporch,2008-12-12T09:54Z,"I at first hated the very idea of this movie, but when I saw it, I was confronted with a very human story, whether real or not... and who are we to say much of these ""based on real events"" are true? I think Greengrass did an excellent job showing what ""could"" have happened, but also showing the pure reality of that day for average people. A bold, controversial (I do not believe the official 9/11 story by a long shot), and ultimametly, heartbreaking film about the REAL people who lost their lives that day. What was initially one of my contenders for WORST  movie of the year before I saw it, became one of my contenders for BEST. The story is there, and it's just as fictionalized now as many of the war movies we love, so political theories aside, this film touched me."
