,mickflip,2006-09-03T16:44Z,Whats the difference between this one and the one that was uploaden a few days ago? Is this the non-prerelease?
,4X-AXG,2006-09-03T16:44Z,yep this is the 'public' version :)
,pilotsr,2006-09-03T16:45Z,"Thanks a bunch for posting, blue skies m8 :)"
,Icebird1,2006-09-03T16:48Z,"Great news, thx for your work 4x-AXG:)"
,Turkish_Gladio,2006-09-03T16:55Z,"Why 180 Mb ? Did you include the pre-order livery sets to the pack ?

I have this bird with two versions NoVC and VC and it is aprx 100 Mb without liveries :)

Also I made a replica installer for both model sets , one is 85 Mb other ise 96 Mb ..."
,hafez,2006-09-03T16:57Z,Really really appreciate this - Thanks! Will I have to uninstall version 1 or does this just overwrite it?
,NullCharacter,2006-09-03T16:59Z,Thank you for a great release.
,baabis,2006-09-03T17:00Z,"@Turkish,

I dont know anything about that, i just installed the things i got from the base installer that came from PSS..that was 300 mb each models..

@HappyFlyer,

Both models are included here, no liveries(they are releasing laters separate)..in my folders is the Non-VC/VC models 300 mb each ;-) i just made an install from the public release."
,baabis,2006-09-03T17:02Z,"@Hafez, uninstall the old version and install this one after that..

@NullCharacter, no problem :-)"
,4X-AXG,2006-09-03T17:03Z,"@ hafez:

I'm pretty sure you have to uninstall the old version, but you might want to save some liveries and see if you can use them with the updated plane..at least until the new liveries are released :)"
,Turkish_Gladio,2006-09-03T17:09Z,"@Baabis ;

Sure they are 300 Mb unzipped :) But when I made the installers size reduced to 100 Mb with zipping inside the installer then rar ... Final 85 Mb ;)

Anyway good work , I will not download your release but thanks again ...

@all ;

As far as I know older liveries will have some minor problems with the new builded models of 1.1 ...

This is the final release , both the PSS and Baabis versions are 1.1 ;)"

,Nitrox_Diver,2006-09-03T17:19Z,"Thanx m8!!
Is the fps issue in VC solved yet, or is the sollution just to use this one without the VC as before?"
,Turkish_Gladio,2006-09-03T17:26Z,"@Nitrox ;

As I could see they have solved the FPS issue in 1.1  ( but this can be a system specific problem )

I was getting 10-15 FPS in the 1.0 ver , now I'm taking 35-40 FPS ( max set to 40 in my FS )

Hope this helps "
,airbus320,2006-09-03T17:29Z,Awesome THANKS! Baabis and 4x!
,hafez,2006-09-03T17:29Z,"Thanks for the help baabis, 4X-AXG and everyone else and well done for getting the release out so fast!"
,legendary_goku,2006-09-03T18:12Z,"Thx for this! i downloaded the pre release version but i'll use this one instead!

,Turkish_Gladio,2006-09-03T20:17Z,"@legendary_goku ;

Go and do a search over the torrent and ED2K sites then post your fucking bullshit REQ list will you !

Do not bother people sharing comments on a very fast and new release !!! And have some respect to others whom will read this page ...

I have %90-95 of your silly requests and all of them repeat all of them comes from torrents published on this site !

@All ;

I uploaded 85 Mb Non-VC model to a non-dl limit sharing site for non torrent familiar friend :) 

VC is on the fly and will finis soon . If you wish just send a PM and I will send the direct link ."

,legendary_goku,2006-09-03T20:42Z,"Turkish gladio don't say fuck because i'm gonna say shut your own fucking mouth!

Some people may want a reseed since many of these products listed are almost dead!many new members that didn't get their hands yet on those products might appreciate it if the torrent would be dead if existing there would be a reseed..I can't believe how rude some people can be....

I guess that you never had education in your life because educated people don't throw silly childish harmfull words at others and neither do i but this time i will because i hate people like you that show disrespect to others so shut your own fucking mouth will you?and i'm kindly asking it...

If you have further comments keep them for yourself, give other people a chance...I may not be a pro on this site yet which means i'm a noob probably at this and you might be a noob at something else which i am good in so there is the comparison"

,Nikolay2,2006-09-04T11:09Z,"Hello,
I want to ask You, from where I can get these free liveries?
For sure it is not from the PSS main website :("
,Icebird1,2006-09-04T12:40Z,"someone has to upload the liveries here, cause the PSS livery installer checks your account details and when you don't buyed the product you are not able to download the liveries.:("
,leobarrichello,2006-09-04T15:41Z,"Hello 4X-AXG,

Thank you very much for this bird.
It is installing better, quicker then the CS B757.
Soon the liveries will be available hopefully.
This time no request but saying thank you very much again.
One beer for Mr. 4X-AXG!!!!!"

,legendary_goku,2006-09-04T18:54Z,"Here we go again...Pilot you've proven yourself to be the stupid moron, idiot and fool and i can call you more names but that is not needed..For the pleasure i will own you....Watch these words pass you buy carefully..I've had enough of you..In my earlier post i stated that people should not mix their noses into my business or issues i have with other people, i can solve those issues myself thanks! Most people here learn to ignore these posts of mine because it doesn't concirn them..Those are the mature people..I'm really not in the mood to reply to your post but sometimes childish kids piss me off...Ok now to get you owned...

Have you ever considered the fact that my list could somehow help people (newbies) in TBP? They might find something interesting in my list which they have never heard yet before!That's a fact...Also likely people who aren't new here want a reseed of some of these products which can be dead by now...

Before you even state calling me stupid get your facts right,mind your own business and if you can't do that then just go into therapy if you have a problem with that..If you have a problem with my post that is YOUR problem..Should it be my concirn or my problem because you find it stupid? NO...Grow up and learn..."
,FSDude,2006-09-04T23:41Z,Are we sure this is the 1.1 version? I'm having all the same issues that are supposed to be fixed in this version...
,rrodger99,2006-09-05T07:28Z,"I have the liveries ready to post except I cannot get the fuselage to paint on any of the 200-rr.

The tail & engines paint fine it's just the fuselage that doesn't.

Any Ideas??

Please post a comment so I can get these fixed & uploaded."
,Icebird1,2006-09-05T13:43Z,"Haven't heard about this problem until now. Did you get the liveries from pss account wih the installer? I have no textures, so I can't tell you how to install them on the aircraft."
,rrodger99,2006-09-05T14:14Z,"I got the liveries from the 1.0 installer.

All of the other planes look fine except the 200-RR model & like I said it's just the fuselage that will not paint."
,rrodger99,2006-09-05T17:40Z,"Well I have gotten this far:

It only affects the planes using the h.model

If you use the h.model folder from the 1.0 installer it solves the paint issue but then you have the VC again & all the framerate issues."
,Vergissmeinnicht,2006-09-05T19:09Z,Where can i get the liveries for this bird? Is it supossed to be included with the 1.1 installer? That is not the case for me. :/
,pilot013,2006-09-06T11:30Z,"Mr Legendary Goku....If you like any software,try it here,download it,and if you really enjoy it go and buy it...This is what are doing 80% from TPB, because everybody realizes that with not buying the software of these companies,they will just die..right!

So think nicely over your enormous list..IF you like something, there is no problem to try it for fry, but then go and buy it!
