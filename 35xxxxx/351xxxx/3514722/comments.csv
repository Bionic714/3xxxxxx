,drskill,2006-08-25T16:33Z,"First of all, fuck you. You are the scum of this Earth.
Why, you ask?
You try to argue on the Basis of ""Free Decision of the Individual"". Yet, in your Movie you include subliminal Messages to corrupt the natural Process of forming an Opinion by including minutest Messages for a few frames only. This Technique is known for Dekades to meddle with Viewers Opinions (e.g. in Commercials). These Messages may be pro-Piracy, but they show that you give a fuck about OUR Opinions and want to make us Slaves to Yours. In this Aspect, you are no better than the Industry.
Thus, fuck you.
Nice Movie btw."

Certain types of subliminal perception (hypnosis, for example) are known to affect the perceiver without any conscious knowledge of the effect on his part. Furthermore, stimulus by single words is well established to be modestly effective.

,tloc32,2007-07-19T11:27Z,you got your information from wikipedia... enough said
,JM_Praetorian,2007-07-22T07:54Z,"Well, I just watched this film...and just registered as well :-)

Let me review this in two parts...cinematography & content...

Cinematography: Good for (I assume) a low-budget film. Kept my attention. One thing, the PB guy with the facial hair I had a hard time understanding (I'm a dreaded American) due to his accent plus his stumbles during talking. This is just me though because I'm not too familiar with listening to foreign dialect...I caught some of what he said and of course all of the other English speaking people. I thought maybe when i was downloading that this would be just a bunch of 20-somethings throwing some home video together of ""why we're such rebels"" but it wasn't and I was truely impressed.

CONTENT: Living in the US and having ""big brother"" breathing down your neck in just about every way possible this subject hits home with me...I'm an avid downloader, seed when i can (slow up speeds) and have great animosity towards the fucking people over here that spend millions of dollars on films and reap profit beyond my wildest dreams. These people are millionaires....the actors, directors & producers....and the ""little people"" who work behind the scenes would absolutely NOT get paid ANY less, even if HALF of all film profits went out the window. It's kind of like Major League Baseball here...some son-of-a-bitch complains that he only makes 30 million dollars a year when all he does is sit in the outfield and catch fucking balls! People that HAVE a shitload of money and bitch about losing profit can kiss my ass....I'm fucking broke and work hard every day for nothing so you won't get any damn sympathy from me, the MPAA, RIAA etc. 

As for the US govt making Sweden bend their National laws in order to serve themselves is in no way suprising...our country has been bullies since the indistrial revolution and this will never change. All I can say is KUDOS to the Swedish citizens and much of their govt for standing up for what's right to THEM and not letting some superpower bully tell them what they can and cant do. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE America, I just HATE it's government.

A key point I noticed in the film was when you were talking about how when VHS came along, and Cassette came along the companies tried to do the same thing...along with the evolution to CD and DVD (and the internet) you'd think they'd fucking figure out that you CANT stop people that WANT something....hell my country runs it's vast empire on that same philosophy.

I'm anxiously awaiting Part II...and I can't wait until someone on this side of the issue (americans) does something like this...if it's out there someone please let me know! 

And after all, isn't a torrent site just a bunch of links, scripts and shit? Information should not be illegal....they don't sue Netflix, they don't harrass Blockbuster Online...they're just databases like PirateBay.....they don't bother those people ONLY because they make a shitload of money from them. If only PB could get SO huge as to build this massive conglomerate where people would be kissing your feet to advertise to your traffic...maybe you could pay off Hollywood enough for them to leave you be.....but then again don't worry about it because ""The force of piers is loose upon this world"" HAHAA....rock on!"
,cheinesen,2007-08-19T22:50Z,how do i seed. thanks 
,sonygeek3k,2007-08-30T06:08Z,"""...People that HAVE a shitload of money and bitch about losing profit can kiss my ass....I'm fucking broke and work hard every day for nothing so you won't get any damn sympathy from me, the MPAA, RIAA etc. ""

I agree / nuff said !!"
,CsmcDem,2007-09-16T02:43Z,whens part 2 coming out!!!
,BlackBeard.Gar,2007-10-31T08:07Z,"well i can kinda see where there coming from if every one in the world downloaded then they wouldnt
make much money. but thats not the case first off like the movie said they have adapted before

 like with videos they complained but in the end blockbuster
hollywood video and many more have made billions and has become a way of life, rent movies order pizza
and relax on your weekend off. im sure if they stopped crying about it thell get past it as well.

same with record companys 

george cloony was talkin about how hollywood was so ahead of the curb this realy smug snotty man should
then shut the fuck up and show us how ahead of the curb hollywood is by finding a resolution.
actors often act like there better than average people like somehow there more than human
well you all sound like whining little bitches to me.

as far as america tellin another country what to do with there people thats just fucking insane
they dont even know how to run there own country yet they want to force yours into submission.
sometimes there unwillingness to show reason makes me regret being american. kinda funny our country
pissed off about stealing when the founders of this country killed and stoled this land from the natives.
next time the words of american influences reach your country tell them its Manafest Destiny, lol.

 its insane how hollywood claims downloaders are destroying there buisness, how there going broke, how there
under attack.. it must be a pretty fuckin sweet buisness to where you can still manage to pay your actors millions
and still have enough to go around. 

in the end its all about corporate greed, yea they have the right to do what they want with there product.
but why not try developing a solution to meet both our needs ..there right to sell and our right to share..

but no they just milk there product for what its worth and move on. not realizing that in the long run 
they lose money doing that, as they can now see. point is the times are changing and time stops for no man. 
adapt and you will make your money

ps fraux you are the sexiest pirate i ever seen ...well except for me ofcorse.."
,hacker_707,2007-11-23T09:30Z,great film. can't wait for the second part.

Amen Brother!!!   While I do not support out right piracy where some numbnut makes 15,000 copies and sells it, now thats flat our wrong! I also do not support the idiots that sit in movie theaters or in the projection booth with a a camcorder either!  While I do not or can not afford to go to the movies every weekend, mainly because I just can't afford it and also Hollywood is pumping out so much damn garbage these days its a waste of my time.  

Ya, the fat cats keep getting fatter!  You know, if they made CD's, Software, Movies, etc. more fraken affordable I wouldn't be using torrents now would I?  I love how they cry ""We are poor"" yet can pump out millions and make billions?  By all means, I do want the artist to earn what they deserve, not to the damn record producers pockets!  

Yes, I am an American and I love my country, but there are those who are running this country that I didn't elect either!   Ya, big brother for sure running rampade.  Gee, you think the US Goverment is in bed with the Pharmacutical Industry? YES! Is the US Goverment in bed with the Banking/Credit Industry? YES. Was the Department of Energy in bed with ENRON? YES YES and YES!  

Here is another piece of information. You know why Bill Gates completely changed Office 2007?  GREED! He completey changed the format around so that you can not even use older versions of Office with it. Also, and the main reason was that ""Open Office"" was becoming more popular and was very compatible with Office 2000 and 2003, so Mr. Gates didn't like that one bit either.  Hell, he even changed the default margins again with the newest Office. Perhaps now he is pissed off at the logging Industry too, lol.  

Either way, the bottom line is this and I repeat myself.   I DO NOT SUPPORT PIRACY!  If your downloading torrents for the strict purpose of making many many copies of something with the INTENT to make a profit then your ass belongs in JAIL!  If your sitting in a theater with a camcorder with the intent to make copies and sell them then you belong in JAIL!  Do I make sense here or what? 

The question as to why we use torrents has been summed up in the comments I have read. The main reason is affordabliity.  My main reason is that I am finding music and movies that are either out of print/hard to find or to replace what I lost or was damaged.  One good example is ""Song of the South"" by Walt Disney Studios.  It was made in 1946, yet it is no longer (banned) available in this country!  They figured by now that the movie would offended delicate sensiblities.  WTF ever!  Ya, political correctness once again prevails!  We are a free society??? Says so in our Constitution, but I'll be damned if Uncle Sam sure likes to over regulate us lowely citizens with laws and regulations, lol.  

In my final few words in this here praddle,  besides greed of the Music, Movies, and Software Industries if P2P is such a big problem, why are we motovaited to use them?  I know that the vast majority of us are hard working and honest law bidding citizens, but even we know when enough is enough and must take a stand to out right greed!  

If I remember correctly, sometime in the not to distant past WE where entitled to make one back up copy of our software, music, etc.. This was before the advent of CD-ROMs burners of course.  That is the main motovating reason I use torrents because I am not that savvy at ripping material from my own originals!  Yet, with the advent of copy right protection codes in place today, you can't even make legal backups!  The way I see it there is two problems...the damn recording industry and the blackmarketeers!  OK, I now endith the sermon! Thank you for reading my views."
,Northward,2007-12-30T03:56Z,"This is, first of all, to: JM_Praetorian, BlackBeard.Gar and tony4505: You have just restored my faith in Americans (some of them anyway). We are a few that believe Americans are psychos, mean, self-righteous and simlply egos. ""Everything an American do, say or think is the right way"". Your country has Double Standard as a an everyday motto. For example: You are the largest country to produce/distribute porn, yet you can´t stand seeing a pair of natural breasts on tv. Nipples cannot be shown, better to tuck them in thick layers of fabric. God is important in your life: praying and churchgoing is just so natural. Yet you kill, rape and hurt other people without hesitating! Well, blame the negros...wich you brought to your country as slaves because you are to lazy to work yourself, and that negros has darker skin...the same skin you are workings so hard to get on a sunny beach!! And finally...sharing movies and music is just wrong says the government, and the actors and the artists wich are paid in millions because they believe they are godsent. Remember J-Lo? Jennie from the block? Pah! Pathetic. So guys; JM_Praetorian, BlackBeard.Gar and tony4505. You have restored my faith in the American people. You are just plain an ordinary people (I must asume?). Maybe you´re not that all bad after all? Maybe you are just like me? It´s just so sad that we cannot hear you!!! You´re dumbass brothers and sisters are taking to much space!!! Don´t be angry guys...I´m just letting my heart speak. We love your music, we adore your movies...but we hate your President, the Government and Bigasses like those who really rules your country; the religious ones...may they burn. Feel free (hehe) to respond to my comments. I´m Norwegian living in Sweden so be patient reading this stuff...all right? Ok. C ya! Your´s Humble Northward "
,RaZorLeaf,2007-12-31T01:01Z,"Only an idiot would think that hypnosis affects anyone subliminally. Hypnosis at its strongest is only a relaxed mood.

""subliminal"" images were made up by a television advertisement company to increase their income.

Wikipedia usually is pretty accurate, but sometimes people bring their beliefs into the article.

Nevertheless I dont like ""subliminal messages"" or cuts in movies. I often try to remember what the image had in it, why it was there, and miss a minute from the actual movie :P"
,Johnny_Eager,2008-02-03T12:53Z,"    I LOVE THIS FILM, and I am sure many of you will too but we have to remember whom it is who use this site,  preaching to the choir has never done much good for social change. 

    Many have made comments about money and it's affect on humans Subconscious, I believe money is an afterthought to agriculture and all else stems from that course of human evolution, if you appreciate this film and what it is trying to accomplish then educate yourself in human sociology and prepare for a war because we will never regress and now we have to know where to go from here. ""You can not truly know where you are going, until you truly know where you have been"". A good place to start is Daniel Quinn's   books Ishmal, My Ishmal, and The story of ""B"" 

    Happy hunting and gathering."

,CaCtUs2003,2008-06-15T16:23Z,"The only reason I download movies is because I don't want to waste my time and money in a theater watching a film I might not like.  I'd rather just download it, watch it, then buy the DVD later if I like it.  But if the DVD's too fuckin' expensive, then fuck it.  I'll get a DVDRip.

The main point is that I pirate because I don't want to waste money that could go to more important things.  Like groceries, or gas money.

The reason I wish to save money is because the MPAA, RIAA, etc. are fucking heartless, greedy bastards that want nothing more than your money.  So they jack up the prices sky high hoping to reel all the fish in.  I say fuck that.  Why pay when I can get it for free on TPB?

Anyway, that's enough of my rants.

P.S.  Great speed on the torrent, by the way! :)"
,CaCtUs2003,2008-06-15T16:38Z,"Also, Northward.

The only people that act like the bullshit ""American way is the right way"" are the rich assholes that work for the RIAA, MPAA, ESRB, etc.

Middle working class Americans, such as my sister and my mom, don't succumb to their bullshit because they work too damn hard to let them tell them what to do.  They want to decide things for themselves and have their own way.  But the way American government and industries are set up is that the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.  I do not work, even though I am seventeen (had a summer job, but got fired), but I can already tell that I'm going to work too goddamn hard for my money just to give back to the rich, greedy assholes for the rest of my life!

That's why you see people like JM_Praetorian protesting against them.  Because they work to goddamn hard for their cash to let some greedy bastard steal it away from them because of jacked up prices.
