,TheArnold,2006-09-27T20:26Z,"You need to have codecs. Google ""K-lite mega codec pack."" :)"

,beardown50,2006-11-04T08:01Z,This is a great movie! A new cult classic! Don't pay attention to anybody that says this isn't!
,spineblaZe,2006-11-04T11:53Z,"The audio seems off somehow.  The actors voices sound higher than they should be.  The same problem exists on aXXo's ""The Da Vinci Code"" rip.  Is there is a fix or is it a problem with the files themselves?"
,ArkhamAsylum,2006-11-04T11:56Z,i have the same problem with the sound... voices sound tinny
,fanoxo,2006-11-05T17:52Z,thanks
,beardown50,2006-11-05T18:03Z,"I didn't have the sound promblems u guys mentioned. dunno about that........but i use a combo of winavi to convert to DVD, then Blaze media pro to burn. Takes about an 1 hour and a half 2 hours with great quality.......anybody know a faster way? Nero 7 doesnt seem to work right for this."
,GoldRush22,2006-11-14T03:10Z,thanx Axxo the movie's bad ass holmes great picture quality and sound excellenta'.......
,braedan51,2006-11-25T14:30Z,"Just so everyone knows, I got a notice from the MPAA over this torrent, I don't know much about how they track people, but beware."

,pmsbull,2007-01-03T00:40Z,"Great laugh out loud zombie flick. Also check out FEAST and SEE NO EVIL. Anyone getting sound probs, check out your codecs, download AC3. Axxo rules."

,Claes81,2007-10-01T00:48Z,This movie is only worth watching thanks to hot babes Elizabeth Banks and Tania Saulnier. And I'm not talking about ther acting performances.
,darknemeziz,2007-11-06T01:49Z,"Great flick, thx for the UL."
,Lynxdom,2008-01-06T21:42Z,"First let me say thanks for the download, I enjoyed it.

This torrent is being monitored, I got a letter from my ISP from a ""concerned third party* about its download.  

Take care."

,Trip-Kings,2008-05-04T11:58Z,"You all should get Divx player wich is a free download, it has a side feature to burn, 6 movies on one DVD! Just invest in a 30 doller divx compatibility player from walmart. 6 free movies on a 15 cent disc is pretty decent."
,yrah,2008-05-27T03:22Z,"Great work as usual. 
Movie is wicked fun and full of great character actors; Fillion, Rooker and my man Greg Henry playing the same character that he plays in The Riches."

,Smuggles,2008-11-30T16:02Z,"I love this movie, thank you!

Can anyone else recommend any other good zombie or horror comedy movies? Cause there are so few. This one really found the right balance!"

,RickyTheFish,2010-10-30T05:32Z,"As always, another quality upload from axxo. Thanks a lot!

Also, to the commenter ""snake71157""... if you like horror/comedy type movies, you might want to look into a movie called Killer Klowns from Outer Space. Such a cheesy movie, but it's a fun watch."
