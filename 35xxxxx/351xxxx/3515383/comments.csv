,darkg,2006-09-10T22:45Z,"Yeah, seed would be much appreciated. Many stuck at 96.5% :-/"
,RoboSpinoza,2006-09-11T02:08Z,"Plz seed. Everyone is stuck @ 96,5%!
Keep the Beatles alive!"
,tronicman,2006-09-11T16:19Z,"Hey..  I was also stuck at 96 % until I canceled my download I started to listen anyway when 
I noticed that the mp3´s are not mp3´s. (not all)
I haven´t checked all. But ""the blue box - 67-70 disc 1 and 2"" are not. It is small clips from the movie ""Enemy At The Gates"". t´s the same with a couple of the ""complete albums""

So....  Mr (Swe)Pelle[Telia]     What Are You Doing???!!!"
,darkg,2006-09-11T20:29Z,"568 downloads and nobody tells this is crap?!

Most won't play, ""2002 - Other Way Of Crossing Abbey Road, The"" is filled with Scorpions clips, and the odd stuff tronicman reports...

Sad, really. Just about the same effort would have made people happy. Interesting choice. If You are going to make a joke, at least be witty."
,RoboSpinoza,2006-09-12T12:54Z,"Thnx for telling guys. Now I can cancel and stop waiting @ 96,5%."
