,Jackass Jimm,2008-07-12T23:15Z,Really?  Only English?  That sucks.  I can't find any more torrents of this here.  Hmm...

There you go, the KAA version with jap audio and eng subs."
,MagicMercury,2009-02-01T21:38Z,I'm happy that it is English dubbed.  Usually Japanese Voice actors suck compared to English voice actors.  Take FMA for example.  Plus I like being able to watch and listen instead of watch and read.  Thanks for the upload.
,Rayclaw,2009-09-07T11:17Z,wicked loved this when i was younger but never bought it so thanks a bunch!
,bambadep,2009-10-25T05:27Z,"Thanks for this, I was 91% on a different torrent, but then I saw it was only subs.  I'm one of those rare few that prefer dubs to subs, I just can't stand the Japanese language.  Thanks a lot for this.  "
,Panacamanana,2010-01-04T20:49Z,"The English dub for the series equates the Osaka dialect with Southern American English. A pamphlet included in the first DVD volume of the series states that a Texan accent was determined to be the English equivalent of Kansai-ben because of the similarities shared by both districts in terms of cultural significance and portrayal in the media. Further supporting this decision is the ""cowboy""-style appearance of Sasshi's hat, as well as the frequent use of banjo music in the soundtrack - all things that Western viewers would, incidentally, associate with Texas."
