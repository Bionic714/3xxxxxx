,SweThule,2006-08-21T12:52Z,http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0365737
,warpengi,2006-08-23T09:10Z,"great film indeed.  It would be nice to have subtitles for those of us who don't speak Arabic and Farsi.  At least I think that's what they were.

If there are no subtitles hard coded then why does it say above ""Texted language(s): English""??"
,Skogswald,2006-09-11T20:47Z,"@warpengi,
Let's be glad that there are no hard-coded subs, 'cuz it seems to be plenty of them on local .sub/.srt sites, i.e. Swedish subs for this release available at http://www.undertexter.se/?p=subark&id=5936"
,MisterFizzle,2006-09-13T05:56Z,"So how is the film?

I see it was upped by a poser."
,Snuppeluri,2006-10-19T19:06Z,Seed please..
,DavidGGG,2007-05-06T07:16Z,"The real Axxo torrent is at torrentz (dot com) for instance, and it's got ~100 seeders. Strangely, the real Axxo torrent is tracked by the Pirate Bay even though it doesn't show up at searches here.."
,Movie_Critic,2008-01-20T17:30Z,Great Torrent again. Brilliant again aXXo. Thanks to everyone else for seeding!
,Movie_Critic,2008-01-20T17:33Z,"Thanks also to ""Phr0z0n"" for the Upload!!! "
,pinalv,2008-02-21T16:16Z,as always axxo's da best!! though wud've been great if subs were added with them.
,atlantisisdead,2008-07-04T23:51Z,"I don't do subs, so that doesn't matter. What does matter is English. It says ""spoken language: english"" at the top, so why are folks saying it is in Arabic? Even the file name says [Eng]. I am getting frustrated trying to get this movie. This is my 3rd attempt with the title. Another uploader forgot to add the video to the soundtrack. Yet another uploader had a good video, but extremely poor volume. These take so long to download, I resent having to seed them in those circumstances, but do it anyway. I hate that. I hope all these good reviews means that mediocre speakers will work well with this next attempt, as they have with all the other movies I have watched to date, AND that it is spoken in English as described. Crossing my fingers that hours from now, I will have a good review for it."
,atlantisisdead,2008-07-05T06:04Z,"Well, it's downloaded. Probably a good file. I did some searching to find out what a PreVail Cam is, and what an aXXo torrent is. (The language on every Syriana  and Leatherhead movie torrent I've found). So, axxo is a person not a recording method. Or, maybe he IS a recording method.. heh heh. But here's the thing. I don't want subtitles, quality cover pictures; I don't want to burn to dvd and resell at a buck a piece. I just want to watch the movie. So, laugh all you want, but how do I watch this thing? It isn't behaving like any .avi file I've ever had. QuickTime says I need a DivX codec. WMV just says it won't play it. Period. Would appreciate any sincere info, before I take the time to download QT's stuff. Just don't call me a retarded noobie. My feelings will be hurt.  ; P"
