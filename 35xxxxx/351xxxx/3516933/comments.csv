,hypn0t1c,2008-12-20T22:36Z,"All 3 OLD albums. Not the newest one Storm the Gates of Hell, which most people are probably looking for."
,SnuffThePunkz,2008-12-29T20:29Z,"hypn0t1c, if you had enough brain cells to rub together you might take the time to look at the date posted you ignorant fuck. Kinda hard to have the new CD in the torrent, that is over 2 years old.
Food for thought."
,Linuxus,2009-12-05T04:12Z,Bitrate? and is it virus free?
,bendoveru,2010-07-30T18:43Z,"Yes knowing the bit rate would be nice, by looking at the file sizes im just guessing there 320kbps"
