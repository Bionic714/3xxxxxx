Request for some retro products for FS5

Does anybody have the Apollo and Tekmate products for FS5?"
,Jassie12,2006-08-12T16:31Z,Had some fun with this plane *snif* and even more fun with the 747 *snif* Thanks!
,MrMansson,2006-08-12T20:41Z,"You speak no lies about a great era....

Stepping into FS2004 way late I get BLOWN AWAY by the wealth of goodies available here.

Just incredible. I foresee lots of lost souls that will have a VERY difficult time leaving FS2004 for FSX.

But then again- forward, onward is always the way to go so...

I think I'll have to habe dual installs for some time.


REQ: more time on my hands"
,belga1,2006-08-12T21:21Z,Great upload for this classic.About FSX...no sure I will play it in a while....as no PC upgrade intended in the 2 coming years.....so I can wait FSXI...rofl.
,WinnieXL,2006-08-12T21:52Z,"X2 4200+ //-- ASUS A8N32SLI DL //-- 2 Gb OCZ Platinum //-- Sapphire X1900XTX //-- 2X RAPTOR 74Gb raid-0 //-- and it runs terrible in my opinion. No, no fsx for me. I`ll play a few years longer fs2004. Tnx for upload of this great great plane!!"
,rrodger99,2006-08-13T01:03Z,"Gotta agree....Though true it's a demo & not a very good 1 at that, I won't be running FS xany time soon.

I just got FS 9 running the way I want & the big 9 fps I got with FS x sucked."
,PopArt,2006-08-13T01:11Z,"Probably no FSX for me neither. Though I think the demo is cool, my system disagrees :) I still have so much to discover in FS2004 and so many planes to master, I will wait for the next release or for the first FSX torrent and have dual installs."
,blankbox,2006-08-13T01:37Z,any difference between this and the MAXIMUS ver?
,toddw,2006-08-13T03:43Z,"Yeah__ I won't be running FSX either ant time soon__ I need to upgrade my PC, moreless build a new one___ the only improvement I see in FSX is the scenery___ the rest is just XBox bullshit___ Bullocks to ol Bill Gates and his Console game port.
