From the feverish mind of Rob Zombie, comes the follow-up to his cult hit The House Of 1000 Corpses, The Devil┬┤s Rejects. Written and directed by Zombie, this sequel further explores the Dr. Satan Cult Murders by blending traditional horror elements with the western genre, to paint a shocking portrait of vigilante justice. 

Hell-bent on getting revenge for his brother┬┤s murder, Sheriff John Wydell (William Forsythe) takes the law into his own hands, tracking down the Firefly family. With the help of the bounty-hunting duo known as ?The Unholy Two?, they set off to take part in one of the most depraved and terrifying showdowns in cinematic history..
