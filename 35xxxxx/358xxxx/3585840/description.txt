Review	by Mark Pytlik
So named after a European tour inspired the band to record an album based on its travel experiences, Holidays in Europe is anything if not an emotionally draining record. Working with an even wider palette of colors at the band's disposal (with samples, exotic synths, and various delays added to the bag of tricks), Kukl has somehow crafted a record that makes its dense debut seem like a picture book by comparison. Indeed, if The Eye was a record that flirted with lunacy, then Holidays in Europe is gunning to chew right through the wrist restraints. Although the intensity and ambition are hard to deny, it's obvious that these songs are the product of a band at odds with itself. With internal sabotage evident at every turn, Kukl would not last much longer; some of the group's core members would go on to form the buoyant Sugarcubes as a reaction.
