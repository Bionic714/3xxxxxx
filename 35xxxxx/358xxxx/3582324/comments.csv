,coolhand6,2007-01-20T21:46Z,"Hell yes!  This is the best music post I've ever seen.  Favorites like the gobs, celibate rifles, hoodoos, died pretty, saints, and bands I don't know yet but can't wait to hear."
,Sektion8,2007-01-25T16:33Z,"You've got some really bizarre crap here, and missed most of the true tunes... Just another mish-mash of PERSONAL favourites. I'll cherry-pick, but that's about it. Thanks anyway."

,Mr. Master D. Evil,2007-01-27T02:18Z,"And the AC/DC - Back In Black album is crap? o.O
I though that was the second most sold album ever =P its pretty much more ace than all of this =)
(im no hip hop guy =P I like most kinda rock and metal) =P"
,Mr. Master D. Evil,2007-01-27T02:29Z,"Oh, I had to add another comment =P
AC/DC did much for the heavey metal ^^
They made some of the first really radio friendly heavey metal =)"
,Hilding6125,2007-01-27T20:17Z,AC/DC died with Bon Scott. They don't make it onto my list.

,mike123,2007-10-13T14:22Z,"Total crap! Give yourself an uppercut, you trendoid Melbourne yuppie!
What a crock of SHIT!!!
Fuck me, arsehole... where the fuck are ACDC?, Elvis Presley? Jimi Whatsisname, AYERS ROCK, Slim Dusty, ...
This is just a tonne of weird obscure crap recorded by a biased record company who don't know the difference between good music and the Pinchgut cesspool.

Anyway, some of our foeign friends might like it (or go insane)


What a crock of shit!!!"

Sheesh!"
,mansies,2007-11-13T18:58Z,Evermore are from New Zealand - thieves!!!
,seamer,2007-12-02T06:35Z,"This is entirely mislabelled.  How the shit can you include the Cat Empire in a list of -rock-?  You deliberately omit the real Aussie legends after implying ""30 years"" and then include a bunch of shit noones ever heard of (Chris Bailey?  Died Pretty?)

Go read the wiki definition of Aussie Pub Rock.  Get some edumacation.

I'm really disappointed too, I lost my library through some lost luggage and needed to rebuild it.  No AccaDacca...christ..."
,Hilding6125,2007-12-04T17:34Z,"The ignorance and ungreatfulness of some don't surprice me no more... Post something yourself insted of complaining all the time. If you have anything negative to say, just shut up and move on. Noone force you download the ""crap""...

Chris Bailey was the singer and leader of The Saints. If you don't know some of this ""nonsens"" you're the one who need some education. "
,seamer,2007-12-08T08:11Z,"Like I said, I lost all my CDs and harddrives on an international move (thanks go out to all the baggage handlers between MEL and LAX).  If I had my music to post, I wouldn't need to have looked on TPB for a replacement, would I?

As for Bailey, the lead singer of a band noone's heard of is still a lead singer noone's ever heard of.

,badlands,2007-12-12T23:14Z,"Amazing! Thanks man, a lot of almost forgotten stuff surfaced in my musical memories thanks to you. Very appreciated!"
,ljtorana,2008-01-10T04:57Z,Have you got something wrong with your brain AC/DC are only one of the biggest rock bands ever and the easybeats took Australia by the balls in the sixties those bands are true rock your a cock
,ljtorana,2008-01-10T05:00Z,just because bon scott died does not mean the music did you are a stuck up w**ker
,desertlightning,2008-01-13T14:56Z,Seems pretty typical to have to encounter absurd aggression with a post of Australian pub rock. Shame. Any sane people out there with some early laughing clowns and more early Hunters and Collectors to share? Would really appreciate it.
,Pikosaurus,2008-03-05T03:27Z,"Wow seamer, chris bailey and ed kuepper are both ex saints members, and hey... if you don't know who they are, take your own advice.  Read the Wiki!

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Saints_(band)"
,seamer,2008-03-13T09:59Z,"Pikosaurus, I looked at the link you provided.  I've never heard of the Saints, nor the people you mentioned.

Granted, people have different tastes, but when one person declares a whole range of...stuff...as the best, without including the official best (ARIA, sales records, critical acclaim, public opinion)...then the list is missing alot of high quality content.  Which this list is.

A better title for the items listed here should include 'rarities' and/or 'alternative'.  I just needed full classic rock to replace what I lost.  Accadacca, chisel, mentals.  Don't have time to investigate new music when the old stuff has been taken away from me, eh?"
,Burger666,2008-03-17T11:06Z,"Sports, Angels, Australian Crawl, Matt Finish, Richard Clapton, The Models, Chain, Thorpe and the Aztecs? There are more, of course. Very undergraduate choice mister.  Nothing like revealing your weaknesses internationally, eh? :)"
,Hubird,2008-05-13T09:07Z,"POOR QUALITY....Too many 128kbs mp3 files and not complete albums, what a waste of time."
,MonoEncyclopaedia,2008-05-21T22:16Z,"This is a truly great compilation. I would also have included the Moodists though, but that's just my opinion. Long time since I listened to The Lime Spiders, Celibate Rifles, Hard-Ons.
Hoodoo Gurus I still listen to all the time, as well as The Saints. Thanks!"
,Chickpea,2008-12-26T08:58Z,The Star Spangles? They're American ...
,krytie,2009-05-07T15:03Z,"Thanks very much, this fills so many holes in my collection!!"
,joydivisionboy,2009-11-21T10:15Z,"No Hummingbirds,Clouds,Skolars and where the bloody hell (haha) is Australiana????"
,halfsquid,2010-10-01T20:16Z,@joydivisionboy-I have most records by the Clouds. I can upload their power poppy goodness if you want it.
,kglogs,2011-11-12T04:47Z,"Thanks Hilding, this is a great collection :) Aussies rock!"
