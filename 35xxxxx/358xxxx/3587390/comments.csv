,ArrMatey,2007-01-04T10:16Z,"Could some one, please, seed? It's up for only 3 days and the only seed there was seems to be gone. I'm stuck on 98,7% and it's driving me nuts.

Thanks!"
,Bagpiper,2007-01-04T16:09Z,Again -  pleeease seed! Also stuck at the 98.7%...
,doctorgordinho,2007-01-04T23:55Z,The others are right. There is a sizeable number of persons caught at 98.7% who wish to complete the download. It's telling to note that there have been apparently zero downloads. If I get to 100% I'll seed for five days.
