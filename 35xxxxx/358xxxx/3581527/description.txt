This is the ORENJi release of S03E11 of Battlestar Galactica, but has the commentary by executive producer Ronald D. Moore that is provided from the offical podcast (http://www.scifi.com/battlestar/downloads/podcast/season03/) for sound, as well as the original sound much softer.

There is only the one audio track, with the commentary, so if you haven\'t watched this episode please download the original one.
