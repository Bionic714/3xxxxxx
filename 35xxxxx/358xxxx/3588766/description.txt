THE AUDIO IN THE VIDEO FILE (MP4) IS WAY OUT OF SYNC!

I've included a corrected audio file (AC3) in this torrent because there wasn't enough time to fix it.

TO PLAY BOTH IN SYNC:

1~ Open both files (audio and video) in seperate instances of VLC.

2~ Pause both.

3~ Disable audio track in the player with the video file opened.

4~ Un-pause both as close to simultaneaously as you can.

5~ Adjust by quickly pausing and un-pausing whichever file is too far ahead.

6~ Once they're in sync, you should have no issues from there on out, excepting a few chirps in the audio, which mostly sort themselves out after a few minutes.

X~ I apologize for the 'cheap fix', but it will work, and that's the best I can do on such short notice, without re-capping the entire thing from scratch....
