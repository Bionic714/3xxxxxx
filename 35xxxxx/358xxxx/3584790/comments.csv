UnRAR everything into one folder and run the keygen, then move the dlls and preset folders into your VST plug-ins folder. Everything should then be available in your sequencer.

Waldorf PPG 2.3 - 80's-style digital synth. Doesn't have the warmth/phatness of analogue synths, but the sounds have a crispness that  might appeal. Includes a bunch of preset banks containing leads, basses and pads. Most of the presets are instantly usable but can also be modified using a graphical envelope.

Waldorf Attack - Analogue-style drum sounds. Rather than use the same tired old kit samples, this VSTi mathematically creates them. The preset kits included are notably electronic and crunchy. This plug-in is the perfect foil to d16's Drumazon and Nepheton recreations of the 909 and 808. If you've got any midi drumloops lying around, play them back through this for a massive improvement over your soundcard's GM set. The zaps and squeals are great little SFX on their own.

D-Pole filter. Showing its age a bit, but this filter is good for way-out delay and LFO sweeps. Can totally transform a static drum or instrument loop. The presets are all a bit extreme, so you may prefer to use something simpler if you are making more commercial tracks.

All the plug-ins have low CPU usage, so are good for anyone running a system with limited speed or RAM.

Everything tested and working with FL Studio 7.
Thanks for sharing."
