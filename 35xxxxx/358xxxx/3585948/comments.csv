,hentooth,2006-12-30T23:26Z,"OK, I ain't seeding no more, 123 downloads and no seeders, you bunches of leeching bastards"

,mikecombat2,2007-01-01T18:24Z,"Thank you 4 the music, the bitrate is 128 (works but not great) and the overall sound quality is good.
The counter doesn?t work, I've been seeding for a long time now (days), but the counter has not changed from ""1"" in that time. Unless I'm the only one seeding... doubtfully"
,hentooth,2007-01-07T20:10Z,"mikecombat2, no problems mate, sorry about the bitrate, if I had ripped them it would have been at max, but it was a bought thing"
,joint4fun,2007-01-14T21:18Z,"Hen, I will be dlng and seeding for a while , owe you 1"
,Whatever01,2007-04-22T09:39Z,"Thanks a bunch, I've tryes five other Queen turrents and they were all incomplete, this is the first one where someone has 100%

I'll keep seeding it after I'm done"
,Herttanen,2007-04-25T09:32Z,"Got the first half during the night, but please seed! As said all the other complete Queen torrents are dead.. =( I'll keep seeding this for while in return."
,Herttanen,2007-04-26T13:33Z,"Come on guys.. I'm missing bits and peaces, like 8% of the file...  Someone with 100% seed, if you'd be so kind. Can't be that hard."
,Herttanen,2007-04-26T13:43Z,"Thank you, my norwgian friend! Gettin' it. Slow, but gettin' it!"
,hentooth,2007-04-30T01:06Z,"I'll Reseed this next weekend (Sat 5th May), and post the link back in here"
,scatmandoo,2008-02-26T07:56Z,"I must be missing something here about torrents. As far as I can tell it doesnt hurt me one bit to seed, it doesnt cause cancer, or make your hair fall out. So if you want to download, please do, but seed, or dont download."
,lordminhaz,2009-06-21T07:27Z,why isnt anyone sharing?? its such a great collection but just cant download with so few leechers!!
