,CSuk,2008-03-16T21:12Z,"Great movie this and good quality audio/visual too. I remember seeing the original 1956 version (which is brill!) as a kid and loving it. The 2007 remake version, 'INVASION' with Nicole Kidman isn't too bad either but this one is way more gripping to watch. The 1956 one is the best though...IMHOpinion
Thnx 4 the upload"
