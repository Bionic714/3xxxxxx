A very paranoid, disturbing horror movie remake about a plantlike alien species taking over Earth by duplicating human beings with soulless replicas grown in pods, disposing of the original person.  Once the main characters remained human catch on they are fighting for their lives facing an organized, overwhelming force of pod people in their midst who have nothing on their minds other than turning the whole human population into emotionless, hive mind zombies.

With Donald Sutherland, Jeff Goldblum...
