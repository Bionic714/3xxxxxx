OneStepAhead brings you another complete season torrent. This time its Sleeper Cell Season 2. If you haven't seen this show yet you are missing out. This is one of the best shows on TV this year. This torrent contains all 8 episodes in High Definition 720p with 5.1 Dolby Digital sound. The video is encoded using the new h.264 codec, and all episodes were encoded using the open source x264 encoder. The first episode was encoded by me and is fully xbox compatible, however the rest of the episodes are not. You can still play them back on your mod'd xbox but you will have to re-encode them to an xbox friendly format. It takes a fairly powerful computer to play back h.264 encodes so don't bother downloading if you have a computer from 1995.

*How to Play*
