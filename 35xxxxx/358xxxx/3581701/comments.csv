,phil286,2008-03-12T11:16Z,"which one is this? the 1988 release(animated), the 2004 release(cg), or the 2008 release(cg) ?

cause I'm looking for the 1988 animated one.
TY
I'm guessing 2004
'Movie Type: CG Anime'"
,Matiladir,2008-03-31T21:51Z,Whats with the blinking screen during the opening 45 seconds? it goes grey til the opening quote is comes up? Other then that its great!
,Tzetsyn,2008-04-19T20:59Z,FYI the blinking screen is true to the original
,derrique,2009-01-14T04:02Z,"since it does say ""Movie Type: CG Anime"" it would have to be the 2004 version since the '88 version is regular cartoon stuff. i'll give this a lash, so if there's nothing more heard of me here you've another satisfied sharer, Many Thanx Tzetsyn... !   (-:"
,wooky89,2009-08-19T12:12Z,How is the sound synced with the movie? I downloaded a copy of this movie once and it was out of sync. Hearing a person finish a sentence after their mouth stops moving really sets off my pet peeve about sound-sync.
,foreveralone,2009-08-21T02:24Z,"well u should be able to tell which form the description
i know which one this is just watched it on syfy 2 days ago
this is he 04 version i belive

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4056699/Appleseed.Ex.Machina.DVDRip.XviD-BeStDivX

but animenetwork.net isnt reliable enuf to trust to keep this there forever"
,foreveralone,2009-08-21T02:26Z,"ad about the audio sync
perfect just perfect
THANKS

,Supertulle,2009-08-28T22:39Z,"FYI: This movie is dubbed to english. If you want japanese sound and English/other subtitles, this is not the torrent for you."
,aje14700,2010-01-20T07:55Z,what's up with 12:35 am? I lost all 8 seeders all at once. what's with that? But appleseed id a great movie and I sugest others watch it.
,mokkan13,2010-07-31T11:57Z,"Please seed, really want this movie."
,starsofdraco,2010-09-17T16:00Z,please seed
,sunnyape,2012-01-21T06:34Z,"If you ever read M Shiro's original Appleseed comic series, this modernised CGI rendition seems a little 'overblown'.
It's nice enough, but it's got a Hentai feel to it and that sort of mars it for the 'purists' (like me:) )
Anyhow, the quality of the actual .avi is fine, so is the English sound track."
