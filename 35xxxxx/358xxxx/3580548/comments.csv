,XyLoSe,2006-12-24T10:26Z,"Also: Are you the same guy who posted this on Demonoid and others and who wrote that this came from a PC that PASSED through your shop? Seemed to have the same hash at any rate.

If so this is the older hard-coded version thats pretty much useless to anyone but the original owner of that particular PC. And as I took note of the files being copied during installation and definitely saw OEMBIOS.BIN, I'm pretty sure this is the case. "
,XyLoSe,2006-12-24T10:37Z,"Anyone got a copy/image of the NEWER ""retail"" (meaning the OEM MCE that one can purchase from a reseller which isn't BIOS/Hardware-coded).

Do you guys have any OEM keys?"
,Elboom,2007-01-05T08:56Z,"bruor, do you know which manufacturer these OEM cds belong to? 

If what some people have said regarding hard-coding to a machine is true, that's ok. If you're using a machine from the same manufacturer that distributed the MCE here, you'll be able to use it. For example a Dell version of XP will work with all Dell machines and you won't need to enter the serial (since it picks it up from the bios) and you won't have to activate. Same is true of other large manufacturers."

,pcstuff,2007-03-02T16:31Z,"As with ALL Windows XP MCE versions, you have to install it on a FRESH harddrive (ie completely nuked and reformatted). It will NOT work over a previous install of XP.

,MaidenFan06,2007-07-03T14:24Z,"Brilliant torrent! I can confirm the following:

1) These discs are best burned with CloneCD - I burned with Nero first and the PC couldn't boot to them.

2) The serials are NOT hard-coded. I used this on my Acer Aspire 5630 laptop with no problems whatsoever.

3) Only OEM serials will work - not really surprising because this is an OEM torrent ;)

4) The version of Windows you get depends on the serial you enter. If you enter an XP Pro key, you will get XP Pro.

I would recommend using these discs if - like me - your OEM did not include discs with your PC or laptop.

And finally, for those who are intent on cracking Windoze: don't. It's far easier to just buy an OEM copy. With the release of Vista I'm sure you can find XP pretty cheap now anyway."

,templeofboom,2008-03-29T22:21Z,"For all you naysayers out there, here's the deal:

A friend of mine had to have his install reloaded after a hdd failure, and he had mucked up the mbr, so he couldn't use the laptop built in restore partition.  He has a valid key, as witnessed by the sticker on the bottom of the pc.  He does not have a copy of the original install media.  It is not an HP, Dell, or other big name brand.  It's a cheap and cheerful brand.

We nuked the hard drive, wiping the MBR, and grabbed these 3 cd's then burned them with clonecd as the directions say.

Popped in the first disc, inserted his product key, and it took it just fine.  1st CD completed, and it prompted for the 2nd.

Put in the 2nd CD, it ran a minute, then prompted for service pack 2 or something similar.  Popped in the 1st CD and pointed to the I386 folder, and the installed ticked on along.

Finally put in the updates disc and completed the installation.

This worked flawlessly from start to finish and installed Media Center 2005.

The naysayers have either not wiped the hdd fully before installing, burned with the wrong app or too high a speed, didn't follow the directions, or haven't even bothered to install it.

Bottom line, this works perfectly.  Thanks bruor.  This was just what we needed."

,XtremeOverclocker,2008-06-17T11:43Z,"BEFORE YOU DOWNLOAD THIS MEDIA CENTER EDITION ""2006"" OEM, YOU MUST READ THE FOLLOWING:

1. This is NOT 2005 edition but 2002 edition MCE.
2. There are mainly 3 ISO which consisting the CD1, CD2, and update file.
3. Burn each ISO to a blank CD or DVD accordingly.
4. It's BOOTABLE from CD1 
5. During the XP installation screen, it will prompt you to insert CD2.
6. Then, it will ask you to insert CD1 back in after CD2 finished copying files.
7. It DOES NOT auto prompt to ask you to insert the ""upgrade"" CD (3rd Upgrade file .ISO I mentioned earlier)
8. After the installation from CD1 -> CD2 -> CD1, the system will restart and log into windows XP Media Center Edition ""2002"" SP2 for the first time.
9. You can install the upgrade file after you have INSTALLED .NET FRAME updates from windows update.
10. I used my own OEM CD-KEY that comes with my ACER Laptop which the CD-KEY is originally dedicated for Windows XP Media Center Edition ""2005"" SP2; So, I doubt it's my CD key which ""downgraded"" this version of windows to ""2002"".

Other than that, you've got yourself a free operation system...well, this just one of many 2002 edition MCE. The actual size for both CD1 & CD2 = exactly 838.55mb. It's exactly the same as some torrent files that you can find for those so called ""2005"" edition MCE.

,nystud162,2008-07-09T07:31Z,"Okay, a lot of people are having a problem getting a genuine Windows XP installation.

There's no point into cracking it, I will run you through a few steps that have worked every single time for me.

1. Use a CD supplied on this site or another, MAKE SURE ITS CORRECT.

2. Enter it in to activate... it won't work.

3. Use phone activation and call.

4. Tell them that you reformated your Hard Drive and installed a few components (If they ask, say something like you had a fryed Motherboard or something).  And that you have no idea why this CD key isn't working because it's the same one you used to reinstall a week ago on the same PC.

5.  They will ask you if this is the only PC that this key is being used on and of course reply yes.

The reason why this works is that when activated, the CD Key is associated with your current hardware.  Creating a hardware ID of your computer, If you tell them that you installed new hardware it would explain why the hardware ID isn't matched.  

Be as blunt as possible and tell them as little information as possible unless they ask.  This works with all Microsoft software.  I did it for a friend of mine who was changing laptops but wanted to install Microsoft Outlook again on his new laptop.  It wouldn't activate so I used this trick.  This is fool proof, after you get the confirmation code for the Phone Activation, there is no way that Microsoft can detect whether you have a CD Key that is being used on multiple computers.  I've done this with Vista like 5 times, Microsoft Office like 3 times, and Windows XP like 8 times.  

(educational purposes only)"
,sageman98,2008-08-09T23:29Z,It is no big deal if you have to call Microsoft to get this to activate. I have done it hundreds of times doing repair work for customers. The main thing is that you need to use your CD-KEY on the case of your computer. That will make you legit. Also only install it with that key on one computer. Usually the phone call is all automated and you don't have to talk to a person much anymore but if you do its no big deal.

These computers have usually been HP machines, but this has worked with other manufacturers too. All you need is the serial that is printed on your case, and you will have a legal, clean install. I've never had a PC or laptop that has not worked with this CD and the legitimate serial printed on the case."
,etheesdad,2008-11-07T11:30Z,"Just wanted to add to whats already been said. This is the real deal. There are three cd's. The main installation uses cd 1 and 2. If you provide a valid ""media centre edition"" serial during the installation, this will give you MCE 2002 installed. Once installed, grab .net framework 1.1 and 1.1sp1 & install them. Once installed, run the MCE 2005 update from cd3. The end result is complete XP Pro Media Centre Edition 2005. 

Ignore what the guy above said about bios images. You dont need them (I did the complete install without using any).

Its a no-brainer to install as long as you follow the steps outlined here and in the comments above. 

Great copy. Thanks bruor!"

These discs came with a ""touch systems"" computer which I think is made by CDW or some other systems distributor.  I was excited to get my hands on them since most other copies I had found were branded to one of the big systems makers.  If I get some time on my hands I will re-post an Nlite slipstreamed version of this to include all the service packs and IE7/MP11 if possible.   Otherwise, keep this baby alive!!!"

NOTE:
Some people have been erroneously saying this is MCE 2002 (based off what system properties says).  This is what your version of XP is, NOT Media Center!  Open system properties on any XP machine and it will display this too.  

The media center version can actually be found by opening media center and going to Settings/General/About Media Center/Software Version.  Rollup 2 on Disc 3 will upgrade media center to 2005 version.  Rollup 2 is SP2 with the Media Center program included.  Afterwards you can run XP SP3 and windows updates to patch all the bugs and security holes common to M$ OS's.  Hopefully this clears any confusion"

,jsk14jeca,2009-05-27T17:15Z,"Hey guys: Let me share my experience with you all because there are mixed opinions posted and since I'm an experienced computer professional, many of you might value my opinion:

1. This torrent IS, in fact, Windows XP Media Center Edition 2005. You can verify this by opening Media Center>Settings>General>About Media Center>Software Version.
ALL editions of Windows XP will say 2002 in the system properties regardless of the edition or service pack.

2. I used this Product key found in the comments:
VQBTX-HHK7C-DF4RC-97FHM-X2QW3

It let me complete installation but not activation (of course). So I used antiwpa12.tk (website) to circumvent activation and after that the key still lets me pass Windows Genuine Advantage to get updates and such.

3. Installation was easy. Both Discs 1 and 2 are required during installation. Setup refers to the system as Windows XP Professional during install, but don't let that alarm you. You will have to use CloneCD (google it) to burn the disc images to real discs.

I hope this info helps some of you...
Its a really good version of Windows XP. It is essentially Windows XP Professional with Media Center features, so you have nothing to lose upgrading from Windows XP Professional. Good Luck and Seed."
,jsk14jeca,2009-05-27T17:27Z,"I almost forgot to add:

4. When Setup asks for ""Windows XP Professional Service Pack 2 Disc 2"", it is referring to the discs from this torrent. Some of you couldn't figure that one out... (idiots)

5. This copy of Windows XP Media Center Edition 2005 can be installed on ANY computer. You are not OEM limited. However, you can NOT install this on a Intel Macintosh using Boot Camp software. Boot Camp does not yet support using more than one disc during installation. however, you can use this on any virtual machine like Parallels or VMWare."

Have tried to make with clone, nero, imgburn, but no luck. I can cancel the request for the 2nd cd and continue with the 1st but then not all of the windows is installed. It says in 'system' that it is a media licence, but no media features.
Can anyone shed any light on this??"

I was going to reinstall XP on my sister's laptop, and of course she had forgot where the CD was.
I had to install with one key, and activate with another, this was the only strange thing :S"
,supernaturalfan,2010-01-01T02:09Z,"Hi there,

I'm having huge problems with this.  I downloaded because my Sony VGN-AR21S needs a restore of windows, typically sony provide no recovery discs and so I'm stuffed.

I thought this was gonna be the solution!

Burned and running discs during boot no problem it goes through installing loads of drivers etc, then asks if want to install Windows XP, I don't get to any part that asks me to enter my serial number.  

When I say I want to install Windows XP it comes up and says it cannot find any hard drive?!? 

The drives are definitely there and installed, in fact the bios checks and confirms this on start up and I'm still getting into Windows, albeit it's f**cked and I need to reinstall it.

Any ideas peeps?"
,supernaturalfan,2010-01-02T10:55Z,"Managed to use to do a clean install on my machine no problem.  Once figured out had to integrate drivers for my HDD into install.

Took my serial number and activated online no problem.

Cheers bruor, you're a star :-)"
,BIRDMAN09,2010-01-14T10:27Z,This worked perfect. It does require a working product key though. I have a valid working product key if anyone needs it. Please shoot me a ICQ at # 459-468-563 . Thanks for the OS!
,sketchman,2010-02-04T19:51Z,Thanks a lot for this. Would be stupid to buy a copy when my customer already has the legal right to own the thing if they could only download it from M$. Idiots. Thanks again.

,Drunkenmunkey,2010-05-01T07:32Z,"I have downloaded and used this. There was no need for me to wipe my drives all i did was chose the repair option when it booted and it fixed everything. PC runs like new. I burned using daemon at 4X speed. and used the product key on the back of the pc. Once it was finished repairing i did auto update and the updates installed no problem( we tried to do a system restore so all the updates had to be reinstalled) The pc has been sitting in the corner gathering dust because i didnt want to pay anybody to fix it and we did not have the original disk. Thx for the upload, worked perfect "
,mucky37,2010-05-04T01:51Z,"If you get the ""cannot find any hard drive"" error when starting to install, here are two possible solutions:
- you might need to load a driver when it says Press F6 to Install etc.
- on an HP Pavilion dv2000 laptop, I had to change a BIOS setting ""SATA Native Support"" to Disabled. After installation it can be Enabled again.
Thanks bruor!"
,Sageowl,2010-05-11T07:59Z,"I downloaded this and followed all the necessary procedures (burned the images at 4x with clone cd) and even formatted my drive. When it came time to install windows, the installation would not proceed past the installing windows screen. After about 20 minutes, an error screen popped up saying something about a cyclic data redundancy check concerning some misplaced or missing files.
In other words, it would not install. I do not know if this is because of my computer (an old dell vintage from 2002) or because of the files being hosted here; either way I wasted my time and cds using these images.
Thanks a lot."
,ghostman101,2010-05-18T13:15Z,"many thanks to you bruor these discs worked a treat for me. Tried a few other dl's of MCE2005 but none would accept the OEM key on a dell dimension e520 until I tried this. I used ultraiso to open the .img files and burned straight to disc from there. For those of you not sure about this let me asure you IT IS MCE 2005

Cheers bruor your the shizzle"
,sgayres,2010-05-29T15:24Z,"It needs to be resaid that this install WILL allow XP MCE to be installed and *successfully activated* using the original owner's product key on the label affixed to their computer.

Other torrents point to ISO's that do not pass activation with OEM product keys and require hacking.

Use CloneCD to create Disk 1, disk 2, and also the Update Disk.  Boot to disk 1 and it will ask for Disk 2 a bit later. During the 2nd disk part, it will ask for ""XP SP2"".  When it does, reinsert Disk 1.  Run the Update Disk after updating to Service Pack 3 at Windows Update.

Thanks to the dude that made this available... works flawlessly with my customers' legit OEM product keys."

It worked perfect with my HP Pavilion DV9010us.
I had to change the mother board. Disks did not recognize it
HP original backup.
This version accepted the serial label in the laptop.
It's a shame this mafia between HP and MS.

Thank you!

,neo-phx,2010-06-23T04:48Z,"@Sageowl

The ""cyclic data redundancy"" error you described is because the CD you used has a flaw.  Burn a new copy, using a clean disc and at a slower burning speed."
,bigfish19912,2010-06-23T12:19Z,"Well I downloaded this, burned all 3 Disks using CloneCD like sgayres said. I install the first disk fine, but when the computer restarts to continue installation, it tells me there is a disk read error. I'm hoping its not the hard drive itself, but I'm afraid it might be. So if anyone else is planning on downloading this torrent I would still go for it cause it looks like a good copy. I'll comment again when I know more. And if anyone else has the same problem please email me at bigfish19912@hotmail.com."

I got it when writing the first disc, but eventually it was able to complete.  Has this happened to anyone else? Please, any help would be appreciated."
,3doxiemom,2010-12-06T01:47Z,"THANK YOU bruor, for this torrent. Worked beautifully and saved us big bucks! I installed on our HP Pavilion a1630n purchased in 2006. Ran into a couple things I wanted to mention that were snags - but finally got them figured out and all is working like a charm - your time, effort, and all the comments from everyone on here with help was greatly appreciated. Here's my input:

1) If you don't buy QUALITY CD's to burn this torrent to, you'll hang at various % areas. I tried 5 brands before I finally took the plunge and ordered the MAXELL PRO CDs from Sears. Worked beautifully and FAST! I wasted a lot of time trying all the other CD brands that I already had - but I should have followed the advice of others on here from the start about the quality of CDs for burning this! :( 

2) Don't forget to ACTIVATE WINDOWS after your installation is completed. 

3) My network interface card (NIC) did NOT show under Device Manager after my reformat of hard drive and restore using this image. Did troubleshooting on this issue for over 24 hrs before I FINALLY found ORIGINAL DRIVERS on the HP website for my PC. I downloaded the service packs (6 of them). Some of them actually install, some install INTO ANOTHER FOLDER ON YOUR HARD DRIVE (which I didn't know!). The one I needed for my NIC had installed into a c:\softpaq folder. It took me HOURS of troubleshooting/reading tech sites to discover that I needed to go to that location and drill down into the service pack and click on the NVIDIA_LAN folder with the NIC drivers in it. I did that from Device Manager, actually. My driver was NOT showing, so I noticed an item under OTHER DEVICES that was a PCI DEVICE. I right clicked on it and installed the NVIDIA_LAN drivers into it. VOILA! My NIC showed up under Network Adaptors again!

So - use this, use all the comments made by those who had problems and fixes, and enjoy! It is well worth the effort to NOT have to buy this again, especially since we all had purchased a PC with it on it in the first place and did not get disks at purchase time!

Again, bruor - THANKS BUNCHES!! Merry Christmas and Happy New Year!"

,cheezst8ke,2011-05-03T15:35Z,"I installed this on my computer and didn't get any request to put in disc #2.  It installed as regular XP Pro with no MCE in the start menu.

When I go to activate, it asks me to re-enter a cd key because of one being used is unauthorized. I tried a couple of the cd keys that were mentioned here is these comments but they didn't work for me. I even tried the one on the side of my PC but that isn't for XP MCE, just XP Home, at that didn't work either. The OS works though and is installed as XP MCE 2005 and took updates form MS website.  I guess I will need to find the crack for the activation.     "
