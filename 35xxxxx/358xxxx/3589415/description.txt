We start the rundown with 'favourites' like from Jan Leeming and Paul Burrell, Tom and Katie and Kate Moss. These are the famous faces who have had you reaching for the remote and hurling the gossip mags out the window. They?ve sold their stories, proclaimed their love, got divorced, got plastered, danced, sung, bitched and pouted their way into your bad books. So now, before 2006 is out, it?s time to name, shame and celebrate them.
