,Jomppa83,2008-02-04T15:19Z,I really love the music they have made but i'm truly disappointed about this one. I may play it if I do something else same time but there's no way that I would watch it. It's a very lousy picture. It's only a mix of pixels. You can't say that this is a good quality. In Finland we have this thing called reilu meininki. So it would be nice if you could inform better bad the picture really is...

The sounds seems to be as good as you could expect for a DVD format. However the video quality is mediocre. I'm not referring to problems with the sharpness of the image (which are to be expected in a recording from 25 years ago), but with obvious encoding problems. There are moments when the screen turns into a grid of very large pixels, particularly in moments with lots of movement/motion. This is clearly a sign bad encoding. I've tested it on 4 different media players on two computers and on a DVD-player with the same results."
