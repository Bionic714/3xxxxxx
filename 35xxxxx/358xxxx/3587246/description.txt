One of the first Broadway musical scores to be overtly jazz-influenced was Leonard Bernstein's West Side Story, a tale of rival street gangs in the inner city. In 1962, pianist Oscar Peterson put his light-swing signature on the already popular score, making it, in the words of one critic, "a delight to hear again" and earning him a Grammy nomination.
