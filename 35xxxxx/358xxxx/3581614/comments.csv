,shoeshoe,2006-12-22T18:53Z,You have the non-dubbed version by any chance? It's hard to find.
,fairchild,2006-12-22T19:43Z,"Yes, I too would like the non dubbed movie, if someone has it!"
,vhs,2007-02-26T17:19Z,"agree - dubbed movies sucks - allways. Dubbing may be used for movies for very small children and perhaps for kitchy martial arts b-movies. There's absolutely no need for dubbing when subtitles are so easy to use in this day and age. If you can use the internet for downloading movies, then you are also able to READ."
,lilwoodenboy,2007-06-07T13:34Z,"thanks for this!  I like BOTH versions ..  undubbed for a more natural feel, and I do understand French when Im paying attention, as well as the dubbed for when I am working and cannot pay attention -let-alone read subs!

,Carpeljet,2008-01-13T00:37Z,the dubbed version of this movie sucks.  the voice acting is so horrible.  other then that it's a great movie.
,rrpostal,2008-08-14T16:47Z,"Damn, I thought this was the""real"" version. I used to have it and can't find it! If I do I'll post it because the dubbed version is worthless IMO."
