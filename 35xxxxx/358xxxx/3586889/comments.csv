Saddam was dropped down into a hole in the floor.
That's why we don't see him hanging in the gallow.
The hanging method used is being called ""The long drop"".
When a person is hanged using the long drop, (several meters)the pressure from the person's bodyweight makes the neck break.  Depending on the persons bodyweight; its is determed how long the drop should be in order make the neck break. If the drop is too long; there is a risk of the person getting decapitated....
I don't know if it causes an instant death but it wouldn't surprise me.
