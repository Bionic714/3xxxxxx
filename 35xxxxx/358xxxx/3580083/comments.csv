,BratAN90,2007-09-23T18:12Z,Wow!!! %) I love you zeek2freak :D MEGArespect!
,alt.slack,2007-09-27T18:50Z,"was happy to find this until i learned that zeek used iTunes to rip the cd's.  WTF zeek are you some sort of complete noob.  iTunes is absolute crap at ripping discs.  If you have the original cd's use EAC man.  Everyone knows that.  No one other than a complete novice uses iTunes for anything ripping, playback, or a media library, it's total crap."
,zeek2freak,2007-10-08T05:28Z,"Actually iTunes is very good at ripping cd's if you don't like it I don't care. Pirates can't choose what people upload. Go find someone else to insult. All I know about iTunes is that so many people don't know how to use it and they claim that it's bad because they don't investigate the features and try out settings. Lossless format is a WASTE of hard drive space, I don't care who you are."
,ashasaur,2007-10-16T00:31Z,"thanks a bunch bro, this saves me ALOT of time....ive been collecting bits and peices of the soundtracks for some time now...but this is COMPLETE, VERY well done torrent....many thanks again!!"

,Lithia_Lydia_Atis,2008-01-04T20:19Z,"Do be proud of this technological piece of music you've constructed; the ability to listen these songs is just as significant as the power of the Force it self.

May the Force serve you well Zeek."
,zeek2freak,2008-04-20T01:56Z,"Wow, I've had this up for a while...=)"
