Some Like It Hot (Special Edition)

The Film 
Set in 1929, in pre-depression, prohibition Chicago, Some Like It Hot tells of two unemployed jazz musicians Joe (Tony Curtis) and Jerry (Jack Lemmon) who whilst struggling to find work accidentally become key witnesses to the St. Valentine's Day massacre and therefore must go into hiding. Dirt broke and attempting to protect their own lives, the duo foolishly dress as women, and manage to join an all-girl orchestra en route to Miami beach in Florida, and luckily for them all of their expenses are paid for. En route to Florida, they share living arrangements with other members of the group - all female - which is especially pleasurable considering the appearance of lead vocalist, a lovely blonde named Sugar (Marilyn Monroe's best, most legend-affirming performance). The obvious complications ensue, with Joe falling in love with Sugar and using another fake identity - a Cary Grant-esque playboy yachtsman. Jerry's feminist charade is also having trouble, with millionaire Osgood Fielding III (Joe E. Brown) determined to woe his female fabrication, not knowing Jerry is really a man! To make matters worse, the mob is on the pair's tale after finding out their witnessing of the murderous events.
