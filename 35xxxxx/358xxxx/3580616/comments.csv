,vidor16,2006-12-20T20:30Z,goodtoshare - you are crazy?
,goodtoshare,2006-12-20T20:43Z,"No, I just didn't see the point in writing a program when you could just post the files, or a link to the files. Why reinvent the wheel?"
,vidor16,2006-12-20T20:53Z,No comment...
,goodtoshare,2006-12-20T21:10Z,"You are not commenting because you know I'm right. Writing a program when all you need to do is click a link is basically just overkill, and trying to show off... but you have posted the files now so I guess you agree with me too. Enough said... Thanks for the Airac files , no hard feelings, and Merry Christmas :D"
,vidor16,2006-12-20T21:12Z,You are really crazy :))))) XD

Happy Hanuka, Xmas, Ramadan, Halloween, Winter Solstice, and Festiva to all.  

I'm going to figure out how to upload/create a torrent in the New Year and should be able to pull my weight then.  In the meantime I've got a 1.75:1 seed ratio and wish everyone else would do the same.  

Even though that would be impossible for EVERYONE to do that.

Many thanks to the contriutors.

P.S.  Did anyone else find a bug in Flight Zone 02 way back?  I did but it may have been a false alarm.  Either way it is quaranted.  Fantastic scenry pack though.  "
,neslesman,2006-12-20T21:58Z,I also fully intend to learn to spell in the New Year.

Req: Airac update for FSBUILD"
,Capt.Jambo,2006-12-28T20:36Z,"Many thanx for this, on of those must have!

by the way neslesman wana know what the torrent community in my country did to resolve ratio issues? well, one simply has to have a minimum of 0.7 ratio otherwise one won't be able to make any downloads, only uploads until one has 0.7. It used to be a very bad community now it is very good. I'm from portugal and the community is called BTUGA. I usually have more than 1, that means what i take i give a litle more!

I'm a son of a TAP Portugal retired Captain, best teacher one can have, my father began with the legendary B707, then the B727 as first officer, he then made captain on the B737, whent to  A319/20/21, and ended his career at the controls of the A343. All of this to say it's in my blood.
I just simply love it!

Happy new year!! Oh and happy landings too!
hope u all practice manual crosswind landings!!!"
