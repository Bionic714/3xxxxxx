,Roro,2007-01-05T02:03Z,2000-06 !   200006 to far away :-)
,Imblar,2007-01-05T02:10Z,"Hehe, well this is a test-torrent ;)
But yes, it shall be 2006 :P
Does it work to download.. ?"
,nUDiE<3,2007-01-05T02:10Z,wtf?
,nUDiE<3,2007-01-05T02:11Z,`why upload NV06 when there is a 07 version? :P
,Imblar,2007-01-05T02:23Z,well this dont contains any trojans or viruses and it is like I said a test to see if I could make a torrent to work.. so.. does it work and how fast can you download?
,lordtarl,2007-01-05T02:40Z,"1. the person uploading the file saying there are no virus or trojans doesn't mean squat. 

2. the speed of the download will vary depending on how many people are seeding the file at the time and the speed of thier connection / setup.

3. 200006 is really far away. Do you maybe have 200005?

4. You do NOT talk about fight club.

5. as far as if it works.. no clue. looks ok but I don't need it so Im not going to download it. might want to try posting something people will want to download to make a good test. name your file something like ""hot baby sitter porn"" or something and I garuntee you will see downloads.

,Imblar,2007-01-05T03:33Z,"1. Well, its actually the same thing as http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3424155/Norton_AntiVirus_2006_With_Full_Activation_Instructions.zip wich I dowloaded and checked with my other Anti Wirus program with no result.

2. Yes I know but it also depends on wich upload speed I have.

3. No I mean 2006 but wanted to be sure wich of the torrent that was mine ;)

4. No I dont =)

5. Actually I didn't expect anyone to download it in the first days but already 30 min after the realese the first one started :)


Have a nice night and hope u got ur comments answeard ;)"
