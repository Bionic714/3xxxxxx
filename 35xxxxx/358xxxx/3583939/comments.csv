,majtymicke,2006-12-25T22:33Z,"I cant find this as a retail dvd, atleast not with nordic subs. Could you please post a link to where I can see its specs?"
,majtymicke,2006-12-25T22:36Z,"It must be this one if this isnt converted from .avi files.  http://www.dvd.reviewer.co.uk/reviews/details.asp?Index=4362

,protagonista,2006-12-26T07:16Z,"The original is 6045 MB, then shrinked to 4GB

Maybe you want to release enough information so they can get me?"

,protagonista,2006-12-26T12:31Z,Dutch also
,majtymicke,2006-12-26T12:46Z,No way! But if it had been over 8gb and then shrunk I would have been doubtful of the quality that remained. Great uploads! I will get disc 3 when I clear out some harddrive space.
,protagonista,2006-12-26T17:55Z,How was disc one?
,protagonista,2006-12-26T22:15Z,"DISC FOUR:

,majtymicke,2006-12-27T01:48Z,"I dont know how any of the discs are yet, I have not gotten all of any. Still downloading and I will seed ALOT when Im done. This is so great =D

How many discs are there ? More than the four you have uploaded?"
,protagonista,2006-12-28T08:51Z,season one are four discs.
,majtymicke,2007-01-02T18:44Z,I need to clear some space so Im gonna burn and delete this from my harddrive. I´ve seeded to a ratio of 6.850 so I have done my part.
,majtymicke,2007-01-02T23:18Z,Atleast disc 1 and 2 have a bit more pixelation than I would prefer. But when its free you cant be picky. I will buy the complete first season when the price has dropped a bit. 52 US dollars for it here in Sweden is a bit much.
,draculade1931,2007-02-28T05:34Z,"Too bad it's from a PAL release... I was looking for the NTSC (Region 1, US) version."
,Maverickso,2007-03-21T03:54Z,can anyone seed this disc two please everyone is on 99.8% including me
,Prinsallan2,2007-10-24T12:15Z,"Yep, Im stuck at 99,8% as well. Seed please!"
,Prinsallan2,2007-10-25T09:11Z,"I will seed this for a couple of weeks if I can get the last 0,2%. Plz seed. I seeded the broken disc one yesterday. Now its saved. 3 Peers right now."
,Prinsallan2,2007-10-29T15:42Z,"There was 1 copy for about a minute- FFS: Learn to seed- If all where leechers like the guy who just seeded for one minute, how many movies would survive here on PB even a day? -SEED FFS!"
,NordicPablo,2008-03-13T21:30Z,"Oh seed please. 98,1% only "
