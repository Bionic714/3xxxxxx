If you want JMEs shit go out an buy it!

The 1st 2 mix tapes are only ÂŁ6 and the last 2 are ÂŁ6 for the pair

There allways getting new stock at http://www.ukrecordshop.com

so theres no fucking excuses"
,djtdon,2007-09-04T17:58Z,"Seriusly its 1 thing download programs and shit but dont download BBK shit or infact any grime mixtapes just go out and buy them 

if you wana see more music like this then they need money from sales 

and 

if everyone just downloads there tunes there not guna make any money so they will just stop making tunes 


do you really want that? "
