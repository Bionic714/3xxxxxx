Below is a little description by Kristjan:

This was my first experiment with stop motion animation and I kind of went all the way.  I took something like 7000 photographs in two weeks when I was staying at my friend\'s house in New York and at my parents\' place in Newport, RI.  There\'s no narrative here, just a lot of things I found in the house moving around like crazy.  I made a  randomly modulating squarewave drone with lots of reverb for the soundtrack.  Enjoy.
