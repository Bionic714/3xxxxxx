Jorge Cortell - Intellectual Property Xvid MP3

In this lecture given by Jorge Cortell to the Norwegian UNIX Users Group (NUUG) on the 17th of November, 
2005, Mr. Cortell discusses the idea of intellectual property and how - at it's core -
it is simultaneously absurd, prohibitive to human progress, socially suicidal and probably 
just another corporate grab for money and power. Closer to home, Cortell portrays file sharing 
as more akin to marketing than stealing, and he backs this assertion up by showing that 
sales for "intellectual property" have actually risen since the rise of P2P.

Jorge Cortell-Albert taught Intellectual Property Law and eCommerce for the Multimedia Internet 
Applications Masters Degree at the Polytechnic University of Valencia (Spain) before he was 
fired due to pressure from corporate media interests. Jorge is also an active lecturer and 
researcher focusing on the interplay of business, technology, and intellectual property
 law, and the impact that interplay has on consumers and politics.

About the Rip
I can't tell the difference between this rip and the original three MPEG files I got it from, 
so the video is as good as it can possibly be. Also, don't let the 31Kbps(VBR), single-channel 
audio freak you out - it sounds just fine as it's the equivalent of two-channel, 80Kbps(CBR).
