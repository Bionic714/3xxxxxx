,Orloxed,2007-04-13T00:31Z,"What are these .dmg files exactly? From what I have read they are like an .iso but for the mac. I also know that PS's plug-ins file extentions are .8B* , * being different variables. So if someone can extract these and put them in a .rar us people on windows would be able to use them as well. If its is posible to do this and someone would be so kind as to upload it to me, send me a pm and ill get you the info. Thanks."
,kanenas,2007-04-28T09:57Z,"You can convert a Mac image .dmg to an .iso file with Ultraiso and Magiciso.  Both programs allow for the conversion.  
My question is does that mean we will be able to use these plugins for windows then?"

,maracan,2007-08-20T00:41Z,"Nik Dfine did not come with a SN.  Can you send?  Also, there is a 2.0 version of this great noise reduction program.  Any chance to update the torrent with this one?  The other two Nik came with the SN's and are working great.  Thank you!"

,bunkerman,2007-10-26T13:42Z,"CAN ANYONE HELP? I've just successfully installed the entire bundle into the PS CS3 Plug-ins folder - as per instructions - on a Mac Mini. Only PS isn't recognising them when uploaded. I've checked each of these plug-in files and they're (PowerPC) and not (Universal). Could this be the issue and if so, would anyone know a way around this? Thanks in advance... "
,moongod80,2007-11-21T22:52Z,"bunkerman, if the alien skin plug-ins are for PPC Mac, you can make them work for intel by choosing  open using rosetta in the PSD CS3 get info tab. it will slow down system but work until the alien skin upgrade is complete for the intel DCD2.

,masterbluestar,2007-12-22T05:37Z,most of this turd doesn't work with Intel Macs - just so U know
,ptannenbaum,2008-05-09T06:47Z,"CS3 and Intel users, if you are installing the plugins and not seeing them show up (many are under the filter menu in PS), try this:

Quit photoshop. Then navigate to the photoshop cs3 application file, control-click and ""get info"". There should be a checkbox that says ""open using Rosetta"". Now reopen Photoshop, and they should be there. 

It should be noted that Photoshop runs noticeably slower in Rosetta than natively in OSX, so if your not using the plugins you might want to uncheck that box. Enjoi."
