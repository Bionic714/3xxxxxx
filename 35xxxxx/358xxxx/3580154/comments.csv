,R2/D2,2006-12-20T19:59Z,"It can't be Stone's movie, since it says in the box above it's 85 min. Stone's film is much longer."
,OutlawServer,2006-12-21T00:35Z,"I forgot to change the date in the little box sorry, my bad...... Run time on my dvd cover is 1 hr 25 min at IMDB it says 145 min so I don't know the actual length............... HAPPY HOLIDAYS........."
