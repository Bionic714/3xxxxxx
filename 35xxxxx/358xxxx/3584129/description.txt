SEED SEED SEED!
English, Video 10/10, Sound 10/10, .avi encoding. Also released as three rar\'d files (I didn\'t rar it!) for those who like rars for whatever reason.
Pretty dumb flick, but still funny & quirky, probably be a cult classic someday. Couldn\'t find it anywhere as a torrent so thought I\'d release it for those poor wankers who\'ve been searching high and low for it like me. Worth watching for a good laugh.
Enjoy!
