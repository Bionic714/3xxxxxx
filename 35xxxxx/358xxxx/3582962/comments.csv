,ladoman,2006-12-25T11:35Z,Any chance of this getting seeded? and what version is it?
,chetwah,2006-12-25T14:54Z,Please seed!
,William_J_Wood,2006-12-25T17:40Z,I am currently seeding (i think). But I am not sure how long I will be able to.
,William_J_Wood,2006-12-25T17:42Z,"I am new to this. As long as you have the torrent open in your BitTorrent software, is that seeding?"
,ladoman,2006-12-25T22:52Z,"well, looks like something is wrong, there is currently 14 leechers and 0 seeders and there has'nt been a seeder since it was started, try downloading the torrent file from here and tell your program to save in the same folder you used to make the torrent.."
,WiNsUrFeR,2007-02-03T06:08Z,Tis is supposed to be shareware... is there some crack or keygen in tiz?? Or is tis the trial version??
