[T],Shanklys Love Child,2007-01-02T07:16Z,That'd be a very long car journey tnekka :p
,Keaneolle,2007-01-02T14:11Z,"Thank you very much ""Shankly""  for all of your great upploads, I really love all of your music.

Please can you type a ""quicklink""  here so I can find all off your torrents on a same side. You have underlines between your nicknames or something and i cant copy this right.

Happy New Shankly Mix 2007 year

Best Regards from Keaneolle "
,Kr0ken,2007-01-02T23:30Z,"Seed please, I'm at 96% :) i really wanna hear those great songs."
,tnekka,2007-01-03T06:48Z,why cant i listen 2 the music?? is there a password??
[T],Shanklys Love Child,2007-01-03T14:34Z,"Keaneolle - the only other link you need is: 

http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3587455/Shankly__s_Best_of_2006_-_End_of_Year_Charts_(not_to_be_mi

which has all the end of year stuff. The rest is all in this zip file. "
[T],Shanklys Love Child,2007-01-03T14:34Z,tnekka - have you unzipped the rar file? I hope there isn't a problem after that???
,Keaneolle,2007-01-03T16:37Z,"Hello Shankly
I know this link, but I think in future upploads, it's easier to find new torrents from you, If I have add you to my favorite links, I give you an example right here:

,telepilot,2007-01-05T13:15Z,"Keaneolle: I talked to some guys on #thepiratebay.org and there is apparently a bug in the /user/ feature that prevents it from working with usernames containing spaces... It doesnt allow %20 or + as arguments in a string.

We must hope that Shankly continues to include his name when naming and describing his torrents, so we can find them through a search on ""shankly"" :)"
,telepilot,2007-01-05T13:44Z,"Keaneolle: Messed around a bit with the help of IRC guys and found another way of doing exactly the same thing as using the /user/ feature.

Do a search with the following string:
uploader: (""Shanklys Love Child"")

or bookmark this page;
http://thepiratebay.org/search.php?q=uploader%3A+%28%22Shanklys+Love+Child%22%29

Now you wont miss any Shankly torrents :p"
,Keaneolle,2007-01-05T14:48Z,"telepilot: thank you very much for your helping

Best Regards Keaneolle

Dont forget this ""Shankly"" lovers:

,Keaneolle,2007-01-05T14:52Z,"Hello Shankly

It is possible to reseed this torrent:

""Shankly's 2005 Top 365 - Indie Favourites""

Best Regards Keaneolle "
[T],Shanklys Love Child,2007-01-06T15:36Z,Keaneolle - sadly the file with the 2005 Top 365 songs got corrupted and I lost a lot of them. However I am going to endeavor to put up something similar before the end of January (even if its only a top 100).
,Talonkarrde88,2007-01-14T19:36Z,"As good as always, :P.

Keep it up, please?"
,zabiyaka,2007-01-30T15:19Z,"i tried 3 times! it starts good but around 80% it stops and says ""connecting"" and doesnt download!
i need this!
help!"
,Twinrehz,2007-03-21T18:19Z,"Damn, mothafukkah! (No offense). It's all .rared, I just want 1 song!"
,Abstracta,2007-03-21T23:56Z,What bit rate is this? 192kbs or better is OK for near CD quality.
[T],Shanklys Love Child,2007-03-30T04:28Z,The quality is great
,Iddiz,2007-06-23T21:35Z,Very nice indeed :) Great music =)
,atlantis_rhythm,2007-06-27T22:46Z,seems like a good torrent but why do people insist in zipping files?  i thought this was against torrent etiquette.
,rjd22,2007-09-17T17:19Z,"i really need robbie williams - lovelight soulwax remix. a bit f a waste of bandwidth downloading 3gb for 5mb song, can anyone seed it or zshare it for me?"
,robfirey,2007-11-16T12:09Z,"Unselect all then click on tick the files you want to download. Simple

You have a choice!!

though why Robbie when there's all the other good stuff..."
,robfirey,2007-11-16T12:11Z,"ooppss shit I see your point.

RAR grrr

look elsewhere..."
,sigurros888,2008-02-03T00:39Z,this is a rar.file...i've gotten other shankly stuff but never a zip file.  Is this easy to open up?
,sigurros888,2008-02-20T19:05Z,"does anyone know how to open this..or if its still ""openable""...i just downloaded it and now i cannot get it to open...."
,ericsepulveda,2008-02-23T04:03Z,"wtf?! you dont know how to open a rar file???? ... have you been living under a rock for the last 15 years? download winrar.. 

there are also versions available for other types of computers. "
