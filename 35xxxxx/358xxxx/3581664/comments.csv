[V],kalleanka_98,2006-12-22T21:39Z,"Read the information that i did put in the description field(just move up your eyes a couple of lines), before posting any unnecessary comments."
,racingduden,2006-12-23T00:07Z,use 7-zip instead then it works fucko

[V],kalleanka_98,2006-12-23T11:57Z,"If you are able to read and understand this, then please read my last comment. It will provide you with an answer. Have a nice day."
,Murda Money,2006-12-26T03:47Z,Why the fuck a CZ version?!?! Czech is a crap language
[V],kalleanka_98,2006-12-26T05:55Z,"Probably because there is only Polish and Czech to choose from, take your pick. If you want English, you will just have to wait until sometime next year."
[V],kalleanka_98,2006-12-26T06:04Z,"And it's only the text that is in Czech, voices are in English."
,Kaskilott,2006-12-27T12:57Z,"Did anyone find a crack for this game, in case you did, please post a link here."
[V],kalleanka_98,2006-12-27T14:12Z,"Crack is good to have, but remember that you can play this game without one. I use Daemon Tools 4.08HE without any extra cloaking software and i don't have any optical drives on the gaming computer either."
,seddy13,2006-12-27T21:41Z,"stáhl sem si ?eskou verzi Alpha Prime z torrent.com a vypadá to ?e to chce crack, ale nikde není ani na gamecopyworld, nevíte kde ho sehnat? p?edem dík"

,seddy13,2006-12-28T16:22Z,"Lidi prosím CRACK do ?eské verze, kde ho mám sehnat?"
,koshman,2006-12-28T18:00Z,"psal, ze to staci jet v DT 4.08 a jede to i bez cracku"
,seddy13,2006-12-28T20:30Z,"Alcohol ani Deamon tools mi nepomáhají, bez cracku to nepojede, tady to asi není ?eská verze ale jiná z upravou na ?eskou, já sem stáhl z torrent. com ?eskou a to je asi z?ejm? v prdeli, (starforce). Crack nikde není, kdyby jste n?kdo v?d?li jak na tu ?eskou verzi tak dejte v?d?t, nechce se mi to stahovat celé znova, dík"
,pyczhy,2006-12-28T23:32Z,"It's not working. Ki akarom csomagolni, és minden file-ra azt írja h helytelen vagy sérült hitelességi bizonyítvány :S:S:S"
[V],kalleanka_98,2006-12-29T00:02Z,"If it's not working, how come I am able to play it? Right now i have drove through the landscape with a car and entered a building. Very Doom 3 like environment, but without the monsters and creepy sound :) You may only have SCSI DVD drivers connected on your gaming system, just as it was tested(read the description field). Daemon Tools is a SCSI drive emulator....just a tip."
,pete1505,2006-12-29T01:34Z,"Kalleanka, if you dont understand Czech will you be able to adjust settings, like video settings--keymapping and so on? If not, unfortunately, Ill have to wait. Thanks for the upload either way, though"
[V],kalleanka_98,2006-12-29T02:34Z,"Pete, settings are in Czech and right now i don't know if there is a way of altering them to English, but I have included a translation(as stated in the torrentdescription) textfile that you can print and use to change your key-mappings and performance/graphics/audio settings. Hope that helps you to be able to enjoy this Doom 3 like FPS."
,mymy,2006-12-29T02:51Z,"thanks  kalleanka_98
but do i have to unplug my cd-rom drives like on other games??   :)"
[V],kalleanka_98,2006-12-29T03:07Z,"mymy, yes, if they are IDE(don't know if USB wired counts) based optical drives. But if they are SCSI optical then you can leave your setup untouched. I don't know if simply disabling IDE optical drives in the BIOS would do the trick. If you try the BIOS part and it works, please post a feedback on it. I have not tried it because i don't have any optical drives on the gaming rig."
,MILKOD2001,2006-12-29T16:36Z,"nexapem preco si nedal na net priamo rozbaleny imidz ale taku picovinu co sa ani neda rozbalit rarkom ani winzipom, do tej pice ceskej"

[V],kalleanka_98,2006-12-30T14:29Z,"devil_033_here, what exactly is WinRAR telling you? Did you even read the torrent description?"
,Itsara,2006-12-31T02:39Z,"Please !

Send a crack! I Hate Starforce!
Thx"

,Bacami47,2007-01-17T14:20Z,"Thx for this good game.

The game is 100% working you just need the leatest deamon tools"
,DJ_Bite,2007-01-22T01:25Z,"I tried both cOBRa and c0BRa as the password to unrar these files, but both are NOT working.
Please tell me what the actual password is.

Thanx"
[V],kalleanka_98,2007-01-24T00:55Z,"DJ_Bite, post EXACTLY what WinRAR is telling you. If you are unable to do this in writing, then post a picture instead, because:
1. The password is the one in the torrentdescription(can't read it, when copy&paste it).
2. You are not using the torrent i have uploaded.
3. You have not read the entire torrentdescription.

So C'mon, please post a screenshot."
,methos_tress,2007-01-24T11:42Z,"I hope this game will Work :-)

Thx m8"
,degenerus,2007-01-26T17:07Z,"DIKY - THX , more CZ games THX - uz hraju :-)_)"
,eirik and,2007-01-28T21:23Z,Send a crack
,DJ_Bite,2007-01-30T13:26Z,"kalleanka_98: it says

! \\Downloader\h\Alpha.Prime.CZ.Aclone-OBR\A.P.CZ.Part01.rar: Invalid or corrupt authenticity information

Then it continues with part02, part03 etc...

This is with password: cOBRa as given in the info on top of this page.

Bite"
[V],kalleanka_98,2007-01-30T14:45Z,"Great DJ_Bite, what more did i write in that info? C'mon read it all, and you'll see something that you can use for future reference, making a long story short:always read instructions all the way before doing anything =)"
,DJ_Bite,2007-01-30T22:10Z,"You know what else is great? That after I ignored it, I end up with an empty folder.
Great upload Kalleanka... 
I'll wait for a working version from Reloaded or other experts "
[V],kalleanka_98,2007-01-31T09:39Z,"Try using WinRAR 3.10(the one i'm using) because I have no problem what so ever of getting the contents extracted. Otherwise you are doing something wrong, like for example, you are using a extracting software that discards the output file if the authenticity check fails."
[V],kalleanka_98,2007-01-31T09:53Z,"DJ_Bite, please read the description again. Your second last comment was referring to something that is not written in the torrent description. If you are having problem with reading it, then copy and paste it instead. What are you thinking of? Can't you read a simple instruction?"
,MILKOD2001,2007-02-05T16:59Z,"is it so difficult for u to reseed it?, just put there iso file/or some another image of this game/ and crack which works and that's it,of course without stupid password,if not u/kalleanka/somebody who has it and for who it works, we do want to play this game!!!please do it"
,jellas,2007-02-05T17:42Z,Password????    cOBRa = functional
[V],kalleanka_98,2007-02-06T07:34Z,"MILKOD2001, 1. I never upload anything else but original releases. 2. There is no crack to apply. Just use Daemon tools without any IDE optical drives connected. 3. The release i got was password protected from the beginning, thus re-RARing it would make it a completely different release.
If you want a crack, why don't you make one for the game, so that people who have trouble executing/reading instructions can play it?And no, it's not difficult to re-seed it in the format you prefer, so why don't you do it then?
jellas, the password you are typing is not the correct one, thus i recommend you to copy and paste the password written in the torrent description, because you are not the first one to not being able to read it correctly."
,Albertozamp,2007-02-22T12:23Z,Belicimo game vlw
,jediuberknaft,2007-04-29T08:52Z,"Hey i have one question .. I have installed the game now, and updated it. Now i click on the shortcut to launch the game, and it askes for installation of the starforce drivers .. Do i have to install them and then play the game like you described ? Willl they not screw up my pc ?

Thnx for the upload btw :-)"
,jediuberknaft,2007-04-29T12:43Z,"Nert mind the stupid starforce shit ...

There is a crack and it works for me :-)

here you go people:

[url]http://dl.gamecopyworld.com/?d=2007&f=AlphaPrime!rar[\url]"
,jediuberknaft,2007-04-29T12:45Z,"sorry for the wrong link ..

just go to Gamecopyworld and search for Alpha Prime, then use the russian nocd crack .. it works fine !!"
,jediuberknaft,2007-04-30T11:02Z,"Well guys ..

after playing it for some hours .. i can say .. this game sucks ..

- AI sucks
- sounds suck
- graphics are not that good as i expected
- hacking ... Hacking ? You call that hacking ?

Not worth the money and download in my opinion ..."
,PCaristot,2007-05-04T05:08Z,"Ok, starforce for this game is easy to get around, here is what I do so that I don't have to unplug my Cd-rom drives.

-Mount the disk with Daemon tools - all emulation off.
-In WinXp, right-click on My computer and click manage.
-Click on Disk management on the left hand side
-Right click on all your REAL cd-dvd rom drives and click ""Change drive letter and paths"", then click the remove button, make sure you leave your virtual drive

run the game

(to get you drives back after you play you must reassign the letters, just repeat the process but add letters instead of removing them)

Hope this helps anyone with a situation similar to mine."
,bongraster,2007-05-04T11:38Z,so you can disable your dvd form bios instal safety driver and the game is runin ok :) no need of crack!
,jediuberknaft,2007-05-06T08:20Z,"Why do all that ?? I just said there is a crack available at Gamecopyworld, and you dont have to disable anything ...

Well, do whatever you like, but in my eyes, just simply put over a crack is WAY more easy than disalbing your DVD everytime :-)

But you are free to do whatever you like :-))"
