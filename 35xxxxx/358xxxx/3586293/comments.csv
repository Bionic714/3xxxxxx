it updates graphics a lot :) and adds a few more features, but it keeps the same great gameplay as the original."

,szd1971,2012-01-25T06:12Z,works on my win 7 64 bit.just follow the instruction in readme.This torrent is great since it has resistance and red hammer along with cold war crisis.For best experience use ecp redux and patch to 1.99
