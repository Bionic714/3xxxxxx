(Foreword by Bhakha Tulku Pema Rigdzin) 'The five texts translated from Tibetan into English in this book are considered the first transmission of Dzogchen Ati to Tibet (Snga 'gyur lnga). They constitute the root and essence of Dzogchen in Tibet -- basic, raw Dzogchen precepts, appropriately styled 'radical Dzogchen'. This is the special, extraordinary teaching of our Nyingma lineage. The great masters have all attained realization through Dzogchen, contemporary masters all owe their status to Dzogchen, and any attainment in the future will be based on the precepts of Dzogchen Ati.'
