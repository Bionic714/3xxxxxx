,Halbermunken,2007-01-15T22:37Z,You mean merry mithras? :)
,piratebill,2007-01-21T21:08Z,"Christ's existence as a historical figure and the consequent ritualistic celebration of Christmas is pretty much a non-issue. All that matters is whether his PHILOSOPHY is applicable to our 21st century society or not. I think if you give it some thought Halbermunken, you will realise that his saying ""treat thy neighbour as thyself"" would pretty much take care of all world problems. No belief in God is required."
,Halbermunken,2007-02-09T04:18Z,Never said belief was required.

,twaseverthus,2008-10-17T07:56Z,"no belief in god is required? there's more proof of god than the guy who posted that comment. he'll vanish and the bible will still be around. available in many languages from all book stores.

protected from solar radiation and winds. placed not too far or too near to the sun, just right. iron core which projects a magnetic barrier. oceans. life. over a hundred elements. a moon that controls tides. food. very convenient. "
,rrlane,2011-11-06T22:20Z,"So if the existence of the Bible proves your god, then does the Bhagavad Gita prove the existence of the Hindu gods?  Do the Norse Eddur prove Odin and Thor exist?

Silly man..."
