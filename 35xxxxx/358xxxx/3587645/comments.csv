,seinfeldfreak,2007-01-02T01:08Z,As far as i know there is no DVDR release on this movie yet. So either this is a scam or the source isnt DVD5
,vickyk73,2007-01-02T03:52Z,Well download the dvd and check it urself.
,abbey4000,2007-01-02T12:31Z,This must be the movie from 2004 with Christian Slater. The DVD of the 2006 movie isn't expected for a while yet.
,vickyk73,2007-01-04T04:55Z,It's not the christian slater movie. It's the new matt damon movie. I m sure by now u must have finished downloading the movie and u must have seen it for urself.

,vickyk73,2007-01-11T04:36Z,It doesn't have swedish sub cos it is not a pal release. It's an ntsc release.

They got another movie cover about a priest called the good shepherd, but that movie is a totally different movie. Would be nice to get the dvdcover for this really good movie. thanks."
