I hear a very low and constant ding for this and have downloaded more than just this torrent, I downloaded every damn thing I could find and it still sounds the same, I feel it is some sort of flaw in the original rip and that it's been spreading over the net like a seed. Someone should re-rip it if the CD's not like this."

It might be a fault in recording that stands out a lot more when put into certain audio compression formats; sometimes that happens."

Although it only has 4 episodes. How disappointing."
,Quazarius,2008-07-08T18:15Z,"it looks like the sample was taken from not fully stable source (vinyl for instance, or even live recording)
so there's sound from inperfect source...
it might bring this kind of disturbance in overall song... so it is in every rip...

As for me this looks GOOD!!! 
not like studio recording"
