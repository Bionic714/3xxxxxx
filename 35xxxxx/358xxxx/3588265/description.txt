Synopsis:

Lavish live-action adaptation of Kenneth Grahame's much-loved children's novel.
Matt Lucas stars as Toad, the aristocratic amphibian with a love of fast cars,
with Bob Hoskins, Mark Gatiss and Lee Ingleby as his best friends Badger, Rat and Mole,
who 'poop-poop' his new hobby when they realise he's becoming a menace to other road-users. 
However, true to his selfish ways, Mr Toad ignores them, runs away and steals a motor car
for which he gets thrown into prison for 20 years. And with no one to look after his
stately manor house Toad Hall, the place is soon overrun with nasty stoats and weasels.
