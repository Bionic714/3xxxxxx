PLOT

The time is 1998. The setting is Macau. Every living soul
jumps at every chance to make quick money before the
Portuguese colony ushers in a new era under the Chinese
rule. For the jaded hit men, they wonder where this journey
will end. Against this background of fin-de-si?cle malaise
come two hit men from Hong Kong sent to take out a renegade
member trying to turn over a new leaf with his wife and
newborn baby. They soon find themselves in the throes of a
dilemma when two of their former associates also show up,
intent on thwarting them at every cost.
