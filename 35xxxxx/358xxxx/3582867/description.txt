One of Longchen Rabjam's "Seven Treasuries", this is a treatise on the four great samayas of dzogchen: ineffability, openness, spontaneous presence and oneness. This book contains the original Tibetan of the root text and autocommentary, with extensive quotations from Dzogchen tantras and masters such as Garab Dorje, Nagarjuna, and Padmasambhava.

Longchenpa is revered as one of the greatest masters in the Nyingma tradition. He wrote more than 250 treatises on a wide variety of topics, but is best known for his works on Dzogchen, especially the extensive exegesis of the Dzogchen tantras known as the Seven Treasuries. This collection discusses the primordial nature that is the ground of all experience, the view, meditation, and conduct of the spiritual path, and the final freedom that is the fruition of that path.

"Simply having this book in one's home is more valuable than having statues or stupas, for it is truly a relic of the dharmakaya."Chagdud Tulku.
