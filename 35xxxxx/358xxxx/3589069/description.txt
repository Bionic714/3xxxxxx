"PAST IS PROLOGUE" - CD 

    * ELECTRONICA
    * label: MERCK
    * 02/11/2006


Merck do it again with a simply luscious and very pure sounding CD of electronic purism. Yes, you could say that it's a bit Boards-esque, but, quite frankly, who gives a damn when it's this good? Not me, that's for sure. Deep, melodic tracks with acres of atmosphere and divine sound design that kept me listening and feeling the love all the way through. And on an absolutely blinking freezing cold day like today it's good to have something to warm my cockles - apart from the lovely Simon of course... A recommended album, oh yes. And while you're at it, you might want to check the other new Merck bits... marvellous!
