         Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) has now been retired for some 
        time, but hard-up for money, he decides to step back into the 
        ring against a few small-time boxers. Everything changes, though,
        when Rocky is offered the opportunity to step in with the 
        reigning Heavyweight Champion, Mason "The Line" Dixon. Does Rocky
        still have what it takes to make another Championship comeback??
