,karnokd,2007-02-06T21:34Z,"Unfortunately, some episodes are faulty, incomplete video data: serious blackouts."
,holischit,2007-05-27T13:22Z,"Any chance you will upload full season 3 of Medium? :)
Thanks!"
,akaret,2007-06-15T14:16Z,"ep 4 is not sync,
ep 8 is some kind of viruse or something
dont bother to download"
,bagetto1,2007-10-15T16:36Z,"carcass2, you need help."
,TehUberGeeK,2008-01-19T06:37Z,"Episode 4 is out of sync. If you're using VLC, goto Preferences, Audio and click Advanced Options. In the Audio resynchronization compensation box enter 11000. That'll delay the audio by 11 seconds. Then click stop and play and see if that helps."
,roges,2008-11-29T01:10Z,Thank you VELHINHOCEGO and thank you TehUberGeeK you were right about the delay.
,Nokturnalia,2008-12-02T22:16Z,"I can't get the sync right, even with TehUberGeeK's tips!"
,ImLazy,2009-02-28T05:08Z,"Sync was fine for me, Use ConvertXToDVD to burn files to dvd. except for episode 6, had some errors in it, was playable on pc, but CXTDVD error everytime on that episode."
,Garler,2009-03-10T21:43Z,"So, this is dvdrip?"
,scatman839,2009-07-08T23:31Z,"http://www.opensubtitles.org/en/subtitles/3409171/medium-en

Matching eng subs.

Also its tv rip as far as i've seen.

Episode 2 also goes out of synch for a little.

Episode 8 isn't a virus."

,Tyvak,2010-01-15T11:51Z,"Save yourself the hassle and don't use this torrent. Every episode has some sort of annoying problem with it, even when played in VLC player. Get a better torrent and save hours of frustration."
,SeZret,2010-02-04T15:49Z,The sound in episode 4 is totaly fucked up. In every torrent I have tried to download. -.-
[V],matimike,2011-03-15T11:26Z,"just skipped e 4  not a big deal  
lol"
,lPyrokinetic,2011-11-26T19:21Z,"@ carcass2 You're the one who deserves to be tortured to death for being a worthless asshole. Really good show, really crappy torrent."
,wicKedShaydes,2012-05-25T01:20Z,"Is this set of episodes really that bad? It seems to be the only complete set on here anywhere and this is much better then downloading each individual one, thanx!"
