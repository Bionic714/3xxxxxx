1) If the problem happens to be associated with video, you probably need to install the ""DivX Codec"". 2) If the problem is audio-related, you need to install ""AC3 Codec"" 3) For further info in regards to codec downloads (for Windows Media Player users), you may want to check out the following web site: http://www.wmplugins.com/

Even so, I *highly* recommend VLC (VideoLAN Client) [www.videolan.org/vlc/] when it comes to playing DivX movies or any file format for that matter because it has a wide-range of support for codecs, which are, by the way, built right into the software, so you don't have to download any extra codecs (or codec packs, etc.) to get to see your movie. The same thing applies to sound codecs. Very powerful and efficient tool to play multimedia files with! Hope, this will minimize further technical issues."
