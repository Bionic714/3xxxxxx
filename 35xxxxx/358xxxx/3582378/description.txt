Paths and Grounds of Guhysamaja according to Arya Nagarjuna is a very significant eighteenth century Tibetan treatise(with brief contemporary) which maps out the paths and the grounds of Guhyasamaja Tantra according to Arya Nagarjuna's tradition. It is based on the incomparable masterpieces of Manjushri, Lama Tsongkhapa and his hear-like disciples.

In many Buddhist Tantras and works of realised masters Guhyasamaja is refered to as 'the supreme and king of all Tantras". Acharya Chandrakirti's Bright Lamp(sgron gsal) states. "This (Guhyasamaja) is the supreme subsidiary practice; a compendium of the meaning of all Tantras".
