,mikeymouse,2007-01-25T00:43Z,"This game is uncompressed but can be compressed to about 355MB(usually 700MB) to take up less space on your memory stick, using any new popstaion program.

Custom firmware 3.03OE-B firmware is required to play compressed PSX games on the PSP.

Update from 3.03OE-A to 3.03OE-B
