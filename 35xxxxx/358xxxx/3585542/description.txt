Did Henry Kissinger sabotage the 1968 Vietnam peace talks for his own political gain? Did he orchestrate the secret bombing of Cambodia without approval from the U.S. Congress? Did he authorize covert ops - involving kidnapping and assassination to ovethrow a Chilean President? 

Henry Kissinger, one of the most powerful and controversial figures in U.S. history. And these days he visits the White House on a regular basis. Connected with Counsil on Foreign Relations (CFR), together with buddy Dick Cheney, these guys make the world a happy place.

Kissinger was the first person selected by the Bush regime to head the 'independent' 911 commision. Agains wild protests they had to replace him (with another member of the same click...).

The documentary is featuring previously unseen footage, declassified documents and revealing interviews with Kissinger supporters and detractors.
