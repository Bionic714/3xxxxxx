,Kismeth,2006-12-28T14:09Z,I had few problems with GasGiver's release... I hope they won't appear in here :)
,del_toro,2006-12-28T16:52Z,"Well, I haven´t experienced any trouble with this release..."
,Kismeth,2006-12-28T21:25Z,I agree... no trouble. But... I don't see a point of d/l this release either... This release is based on november's bugfixes... I deleted it and uploaded previous XMBC to my X. :]
,del_toro,2006-12-29T01:01Z,"Ehmm... What do you mean ""based on november´s bugfixes""? Maybe I´m just don´t understand what you mean, but this is the latest T3CH-release. And according to the changelog the last revision implemented was the 25th of Dec... Even though you´d think they´d take a day off at least on Xmas."
,del_toro,2006-12-29T01:01Z,"without the ""`m"" =)"
,rebecca2,2006-12-29T05:39Z,"can someoone post the xbox live games such as all these

,del_toro,2006-12-30T04:57Z,"Well... My thought was that the 25th was a national holiday (in Sweden anyway) whereas the 24th is not. So you work christmas eve, not on christmas day, but on the other hand XBMC is probably made in spare time not on work time so it would be quite logical if they worked on the 25th (albeit sad though). By the way, you give presents on the 25th in USA... =)"
,del_toro,2006-12-31T03:28Z,Amen!
,del_toro,2006-12-31T03:29Z,Hmm... När jag läser det undrar jag om det kanske lät bättre i mitt huvud. Jag menade som i att jag håller med =)
