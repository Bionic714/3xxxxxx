Xpand Rally Xtreme is the Extreme follow-up to the 2004 Xpand Rally racing sim. The new game features a chilling adrenaline rush racing spree: tracks designed according to hundreds of authentic special stages from real life rally races full of moguls, jumps, grooves and tight hairpins, plus an even greater sense of raw power are only some of the game's new features.

This single-player demo contains a pair of tracks situated in Malaysia and Italy, drivable with a choice of two cars from groups AC and WRL.
