,neslesman,2007-01-01T20:56Z,"It's not long since Max uploaded the original of this but boy is it a great package.  Literally hundreds, or at least a hundred plus UK airports in very high quality, especially Gatwick, Heathrow and Glasgow.  Ever since I've installed it I've almost exclusively flown navigation and instrument practice, landings and touch and goes throughout the UK and have never seeing the same airport twice.

10/10 thanks to Maximus and now namestain."
