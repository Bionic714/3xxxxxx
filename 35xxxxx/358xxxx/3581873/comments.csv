Too bad I'm Intel, just trying to be patient for the Intel SSE2 release... coming soon, I think....

Nice release!  Good work to all involved."
,Cynic821,2006-12-23T11:38Z,"hey TUBGIRL...

FUCKYOU

call people jews for not buying a new cpu, yet your too much of a mizer to buy the superior apple hardware.  eat. a. dick."
,_TubGirl_,2006-12-23T12:45Z,Hey Cynic821 yes you are a jew now go back in the oven and stfu
,yuris9,2006-12-23T15:57Z,thank you TubGirl
,intrax,2006-12-24T02:42Z,Hey TUBGirl great release ! Thanks... will seed this 2:1 once it's arrived.... Merry Christmas to all and start running OSX on all those ghetto rigs... :-) 
,eximer,2006-12-24T04:48Z,"This is an interesting dilemma, among others:

* Should we have used medical discoveries made by nazi experiments in concentration camps? (if there were any discoveries at all)
* Shoud gold from South-Africa in its slavery-apartheid time have been bought in the 60's-70's?
* ... and many other similar juicy situations which we don't even thing about every day.

And now: should we honor myzar/goatsecx/tubgirl obvious neo-nazi racism by downloading his dvd, since only he has been able to provide adequate AMD support in the hackint0sh world? (no offense to jas)

Well, we're still using transistors, even though Shockley was a notorious racist bigot s.o.b., aren't we? And who among us doesn't buy some items that we know comes from some sweatshops in asia?

So, I'll still use myzar's work, notwithstanding his weird fascination with anuses and fetishism about excrements (search google for 'tubgirl'...), and his antisemitic mental illness.

I'm sure that deep down, he's a good guy when he wants to. At least I hope so.

Keep up the good work myzar."
,varmekanin,2006-12-25T02:25Z,"""PATA HD on nforce4"", I hope that is ""no sata support on nforce4"" and not ""pata and nforce4 required"".

""call people jews for not buying a new cpu, yet your too much of a mizer to buy the superior apple hardware. eat. a. dick.""

I've nothing against being called a jew, fucking racist! Also I haven't found this so called superior Apple hardware, if it existed I would already have bought a Macbook Pro or maybe the iMac. 256MB vram in the first one or upgradable gfx in the later one and they would have had my money.

Medicine discoverys? Sure.

Shall we trade stolen goods from other people? No, give back what is theirs, fucking colonist people =P

How do I support tubgirl by getting this? And what says he's a nazi anyway? And Jas just haven't release his version since I suspect he respect the fact that Semthex don't think it's final yet and haven't release it + source yet. It will be there, it's not like Jas can't do it ;)

Of course I buy things from poor countries, shouldn't I? What shall we live on then?

There is nothing wrong with taking a dump in the tub."
,janonden,2006-12-25T15:29Z,Support ASUS M2N-E ?

,filomur,2006-12-27T14:35Z,"So anybody put this on nforce5 (570, 590) ?"
,ramijames,2006-12-31T21:44Z,"I don't know why, but the install is going super slow. it takes like ten minutes to get into the actual language selection screen. then it stalls and doesn't keep going.

is it a bad burned disc or has someone else had this problem too?

using AMD athlon64 3200+ SSE2 on an Nforce chipset. JaS installed perfectly but i want 10.4.8 for the nvidia video card stuff."
,nnc,2007-01-03T23:29Z,"Does anyone have any more info about what hardware is supported?

Is there some web page about it?

Thanks"
[V],pythonx,2007-01-06T13:15Z,""" fuckyou to apple and its X86 clones with a broken bios and partition table.""

Ehms, first of..it's not a Broken BIOS, it's not even BIOS it is EFI... and Broken partition table? FUCK it is GPT, not ordinary BIOS/MBR.

Think a person smart enough to actually create a  torrent and upload it would be smart enough to know the difference between BIOS and EFI and not call it ""broken bios""..."

,Notebook guy,2007-01-20T11:46Z,"Since SSE2 doesn't work, can we use SSE3?"
,vonkain,2007-01-24T01:16Z,"Hey does it work on a ps/2 keyboard?

,Metron,2007-02-06T09:19Z,"""even jews with a ghetto cpu""; I read that as, ""even someone in extremely dire circumstances probably not of their own choice"".  I don't see anything racist there.  You people need to take your brains out of your asses and back into your skulls."

,chuckbales,2007-02-15T03:03Z,"Mine gets hung up after choosing to install, gets to a line mentioning buffer headers and IO clusters, then sits there dead, can't get past it.

A Pentium M 1.8Ghz should work, no?"
,chuckbales,2007-02-15T03:03Z,"And also, can this be dual-booted with XP?"

,limepile,2007-05-31T20:18Z,"Funny how people are quick to condemn with their politically correct lack of thought. ""cochy"" needs to pull his head out of his ass and think about the jews, in the ghetto they had to make shit out of anything they could find, resourcefull, wasting nothing, being smart. Thats what I took from Tubgirls comment. Mention jews and you're a racist? Think you idiot. Thanks for the up Tubgirl, smart and resourcefull !!"
