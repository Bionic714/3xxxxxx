OSX 1048 AMD FINAL

Requirements SSE3 or SSE2 cpu, PATA HD on nforce4

Notes:

SSE2 support is still not 100% perfect but it works so even jews with a ghetto cpu can use it :P

512MB Nvidia Cards aren\'t working, don\'t install the nv40 package if you have one


Merry Christmas and a big fuckyou to apple and its X86 clones with a broken bios and partition table. Hopefully you\'ll go out of hardware business asap
