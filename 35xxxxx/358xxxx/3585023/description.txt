SoulBlade for the PSP. 
This copy must be played on Dark Ales's 3.02oe-b firmware.

Extract and put the EBOOT.PBP and KEYS.BIN in a folder named 'SOULBLADE' within the PSP/GAME directory on the memory stick.

When first played you may notice the screen is not postioned correctly so go to options in the main menu of SoulBlade. In the options select 'Adjust screen' and position the screen correctly.

Save after making the adjustment and it will be correct every time you load the game.
