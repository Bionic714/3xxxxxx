Generative art from the series \\\'Inherited Delusions\\\' by Helmuth Ziegenmalte 

Ziegenmalte is downloading popular TV news clips from several filesharing networks. This material is fed into a fungoid digital image processing system based on aesthetic rules - acting deconstructive only at first sight. The result of this proces is shared again on the same filesharing networks and is spreading on the internet like a fungus.
