,shuffler,2007-01-26T18:10Z,"I put LOTS of files up here like this one and I'm pissed at the number of times people grab and just fuck off once they have the files themselves.

Torrents are a game of KARMA. 

Idiots."

,resonator,2007-02-18T01:54Z,"Everyone should see this. Very interesting documentary I must say. But for every answer presented here, there are a 1000 more new questions that need to be addressed. This is hard stuff to digest, although I'm consider myself being more of ""a believer"" than a sceptical. This is not just about the UFO-phenomenon, but also handles the earth's political and economical systems, our technical and medical progress together with the military, media and religion aspects to the whole universe and the history of mankind. (Did I say it raises more questions than answers ?!) The documentary is of course, as always with these subjects US focused, but several of the interviewed people /witnesses are not the usual well-known (or infamous) UFO-researchers, but seemingly sane and trustworthy scientists, pilots etc which make the stated truths more ""disturbing"" and harder to make excuses for. You won't  see any cults, lunatics or freaks in this one. Most frequent quote is ""The evidence is overwhelming"", and I have to agree. The documentary left me with an incredibly strong I want to know more about all of it feeling. Knowledge is power. "
,mGoLos,2007-02-22T16:32Z,I guess I have to give this one a chance. Thanks for the upload.
,Bulbos,2007-04-14T21:16Z,Interesting documentary! Thanks uploader!
,c_e_l_l,2007-08-28T03:41Z,Let it all be known!

,mike123,2007-10-12T13:51Z,"Huh? Is everyone here living on a staple diet of propaganda?

It's pretty simple; 
.Tesla came up with electrogravitics.
.The Nazis cottoned onto it about 20 years later.
.The Yanks used the Rat Lines to bring the Nazi researchers to the states after WW2
.They needed a cover story to cover the whole show...
And guess what? Alien visitations were born! The almost perfect cover!"

,Nattyman,2008-01-02T20:04Z,"Hey Mike123
If its all just to cover the work of Telser etc  then that would make sense for say for the first 10 years or so, but these ""alien visitations"" have been going on for a long time now. Are you saying that the US government/military have been experimenting with this black technology for 70+ years and still have not actually done anything with it yet?"
,Art_Vendelay,2008-01-26T23:12Z,"having trouble with sound...also when i go to burn it tells me cant recognize file, whats wrong with this file"
,FenixII,2008-02-13T18:41Z,"Well. 

There may be UFO's, there may not be. 
I'd say this docu proves little, if anything. 

associating to the Adamski fund and the works by George Adamski himself (died 1965) severely diminishes the credability of the program. 

Adamski thought he had met a ETI from Venus, and at one point claimed that he had been invited to a conference on saturn. (see wikipedia)

Logically speaking, the chances that we are not alone in a potentially endless universe is huge. 
This however does not mean that we have been visited by ETI*S. 

Given our ol' faithfull E=mc2 + the fact that space appears to be flat, not convulsed, makes intergalactic spaceflight very unlikely and timeconsuming, no matter level of technology. 

refering to the web for giving the term ""fastwalker"" veracity is not convincing either, the hits you get is from a)SafeSpace's own site B)sites like YouTube etc and other belivers. 

Gimme some classified documents goddammit! 

The ZetaRetuli reference is not very convincing either.. Binary starsystems is not very promising for development of life. First of, the stars rotation round eachother causes gravitational shifts that could be harfmul. Second, this may also result in very shifting temperatures. Third, binary systems is less likely to host planets, due to the fact that the stars will need most of the matter available. 

Also, one of the stars in Zeta Retuli appears to be a pulsating star, wich would make the temperatures in the system would be even more shifting and unhospitable. 

Apart from all this critizism, the docu mostly contains the traditional tales by UFO belivers, including the reoccuring claims that ""we have classified documents"". However, we get no ""footnotes"" or other ways to verify the claims.

,kronika_psybn,2008-03-18T16:01Z,"FenixII you sound like one of those losers from SETI. Trying to keep everyone in the dark when what they are saying is the truth. Everyone in this movie is 100% creditable. Dr's, Phd's and air force pilots. How can you say 'Adamski severely diminishes the credability of the program' ?????????????????? because Adamski 'claimed that he had been invited to a conference on saturn'. If aliens exist do you not think they would have made contact with mankind by now? I certainly do. seriously, you sound like some loser who has been paid to make aliens look like figments of the imagination. Where it is actual proven fact that aliens might exist. and they might be working with the governments in the world today.

YOU CANT TELL ME ANY DIFFERENT FenixII BECAUSE I'VE SEEN A UFO AND I KNOW WHATS REAL. I KNOW WHAT I SEE IS THE TRUTH.

ignore FenixII's post, its obvious they have nothing better to do than manipulate you into being non believers. they fail at life."
,eastern876,2008-06-03T10:35Z,"If you are interested in UFOs, you will definitely want to get the following torrent: 

In the 1980s, radio station KABC carried the ground-breaking radio program ""OPEN MIND"" with host Bill Jenkins.   The subject matter covered included UFOs, alternative energy, spirituality, ancient religions, and more.   Bill Jenkins later went on to host the classic film ""THE NAKED TRUTH"" with Jordan Maxwell, upon which the current internet hit ""ZEITGEIST"" is based.

The ""Open Mind"" radio programs have not been heard in many years ... until now.   We recently came into possession of a large collection of cassette tape recordings which had been made by a loyal listener, and had them digitized into MP3s.  This is a priceless collection of otherwise unattainable radio programs.   It is being freely shared here in an effort to make sure it is not lost to  history.

,highlander777,2008-08-27T07:49Z,"Well, I downloaded this video and watched it. I went to every website cited in the video. There was NO conclusive evidence in any of these websites. All the pictures are small, fuzzy and in black and white. It's all hearsay.

It seems this video is a marketing tool for these websites to sell their books and DVDs. Bah.
