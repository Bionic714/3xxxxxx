Now.....what I make with this..??
The readme in the patch pack show
Flight Enviroment - Flight1 Software
1) Run FE_Setup.exe
2) Run FE_Upgrade1.exe
3) Copy the 3 Patched files from FE_Patch.rar
   to your \Flight Simulator 9\Flight One Software\Flight Environment
   folder and confirm overwrites.
4) Edit the FE_Information.CFG file in the same folder so the first 2
   lines in the [Main] section read:
showRandomizer=1
showFavorites=1
5) Save the file and Ur good to go!

Run FE_Upgrade1.exe ... ????
Where is this file ... ????
