POINT BLANK (1967)

ACTORS: Lee Marvin, Angie Dickinson, Keenan Wynn, Carroll O'Connor, Lloyd Bochner, etc.
DIRECTOR: John Boorman

TAGLINE: There are two kinds of people in his up-tight world: his victims and his women. 
And sometimes you can't tell them apart. 

PLOT SYNOPSIS: "Point Blank" is an expertly made, fast-moving film, based on the theme of the 
individual pitted against the large, impersonal organization. Here the central character is 
an old-fashioned loner of a gunman (Lee Marvin) embroiled with a large-scale, corporate 
criminal operation behind a respectable-looking 'front'. Without delving into psychology or 
motivation, the film places emphasis on action and surface appearances, superbly capturing the 
glossy, depersonalized feel of a 1967 Los Angeles--a nightmare landscape of concrete, glass 
and coiling freeways.
