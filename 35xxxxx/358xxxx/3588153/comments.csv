,elifrac,2007-01-02T14:39Z,Is this going to take you 3 weeks to seed like the last one ?
,Kyros3,2007-01-03T13:21Z,YES! These volumes are from my personal collection and I seed alone until someone with better connection downloads them and seed them. So be patient and seed if you want others to download them faster...

The fact that you are uploading on your own doesn't have anything to do with three weeks it took you to upload the previous torrent, its obvious you have limited your uplink on purpose.

Here is a suggestion: set uplink speed to full during the time when you don't use your connection, like at night. That way we'll download properly for at least several hours."
,Kyros3,2007-01-04T11:20Z,I have upload limit only for the files that I download. My files that I share with others not only there is no limit but at night I increase the general upload limit. I must have a general upload limit because my 768kbps connection isn't so good to download and upload  these kind of files. I will test increasing the general upload limit. Thanks for your suggestions
