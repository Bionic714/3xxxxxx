This is a \"homemade\" DVD from an Xvid. Beware, quality is so and so. It only got swedish subs and its not removeable. Sub is homemade too... Anyway, I hope someone enjoys it. I\'ll seed for some time but not so long. I\'m a bit short of space.

Jamie Uys\' sole documentary is beautiful, tragic in places, hilarious in places, and always charming. What it\'s not is accurate, but that detracts not one whit from its charm. \"
