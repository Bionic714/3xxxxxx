VirtualDrive is a soft that emulates your computer?s CD-ROM/DVD-ROM drive which enables you to run CD and DVD programs like PC games and DVD movies (non-CSS) directly from your hard drive without the use of the physical CD/DVD-ROM drive or the actual disc. VirtualDrive makes a copy of the CD-ROM or DVD-ROM image (called a virtual CD) directly on your hard drive and plays it in a ?virtual drive?.
