Soundtrack for \"A Scanner Darkly\" with the score by Graham Reynolds featuring the Golden Arm Trio and includes exclusive remixes of Graham\'s music by DJ Spooky and Jack Dangers (Meat Beat Manifesto). Reynolds set to work on remixing the surround sound music into stereo. Reynolds selected 44 minutes out of the film score in order to craft something to listen to while attempting to retain some feel of the arc of the film. Some of the shorter cues were assembled into longer tracks.
