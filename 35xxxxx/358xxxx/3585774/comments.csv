CPU usage is low-to-medium for a virtual analogue and the display is stylish and clear. Standard volume is a bit low, which means it doesn't immediately seem very hard-hitting in comparison to other VSTis, but turn up your amp and enjoy the phatness.
Lots of preset banks but also some extensive tweaking options. If you've not already got a ton of dance/techno VSTis, this has all the usual bread and butter basses and synth sounds, along with some nice analogue-style drum kits. 
Well worth having in your arsenal.

Thanks for sharing."
