,w00tterz,2007-02-04T00:12Z,more seeders please :) i appreciate everyones efforts here but no one will finish a torrent this large that downloads at a pace of less than 1K/s.
,w00tterz,2007-02-04T00:17Z,"woah, i take that comment back. great job guys. only, there are no seeders =/"

,jonnycostly,2007-07-13T05:24Z,how do torrents work?
,Jay87,2007-10-07T05:15Z,um I can't get them to play I have the divx codex but nothing will play them. I don't know if anyone else has had this problem.
,touchworks,2007-10-15T20:51Z,"seriously guys, seed... I'm stuck at 99.87%... it would take 10 minutes to get the last of it...   good karma comes to those who seed... but my karma will run over your dogma if you don't."
,oggmuzak,2008-01-05T17:43Z,"One of the episodes is widescreen, ""Futurama - 2x02 - Mars University.avi"", and it is stretched and looks like crap."
,isthisthereallife,2008-02-18T10:55Z,"episodes are in different file formats, and it was quite the hassle tracking down all of those goddamn codecs. also, video quality differs from great on some to piss poor on others. great show though
video: 5/10-10/10, on average about a 7/10
audio: 9/10, -1 for needing dumb codecs = 8/10
content: 10/10"
,FlamingAnt,2008-02-29T05:01Z,"tracker check. theres actually 100 seeders to 900 peers. 2/28/08 8pm PST

this torrent is doomed. noones reseading it and it's too big. i've gotten up to .4 ratio not bad, thats 5gb! i'm sure some people have uploaded well over 100 gb's thanks to u."
,Kakis.91,2008-06-13T01:18Z,Downloading from 7 of 53 pers? Seed ffs!
,neuroxik,2008-07-22T05:00Z,TYhanks heeps! Can't wait to see the extras too!
,CherryxDarling,2009-07-22T03:38Z,"Great torrent but honestly the extras are the only thing I downloaded and they are very very small. I still watched them, but the overall quality of the actual video isn't all that great. "
