Episodes 6 to 10 of the classic space series shown on UK TV in the early seventies, following the war between a secret organisation based in England and an alien race who are using human beings for spare body parts. Some of the predictions made in the show came true, such as phones in cars. Nicely non-PC with a dark mood to it, most of the episodes do not end on a happy note.
