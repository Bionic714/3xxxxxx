,IncubusAZ,2006-12-31T22:05Z,What is the link to the other episodes please???
,pip1,2007-01-01T02:56Z,"could you please recode these with AVC/x264 perhaps http://mulder.dummwiedeutsch.de/home/html/projects.html#mencoder264 is easyest to use for a gui.

far better quality at a far lowerbitrate and filesize ,thats got to be werth the effort and you 153 gig will be reduced a hell of a lot.

with practice you can get good looking AVC encodes down to 100meg an hour..."
,zarekguate,2007-01-21T06:08Z,I am extremely happy and grateful that you uploaded. Thanks for the effort. It looks great.
,MorganFreeman,2007-02-01T06:09Z,"Wow pip1 you seem to have done all the work, now instead of whining about what other's haven't done with the newest codec (that you'll be complaining about people using in no time), why don't you shut up and do it yourself...
whiner...

Shut up and encode it yourself, and post it yourself, then we can all critique your work.


OKAY, NOW FOR WHAT THE COMMENTS SECTION IS FOR:

Clean quality audio and video.
1970 TV show from Gerry Anderson (the Thunderbirds and you can see it), but this is miles better. Set in the future (1980) this show was literally years ahead of it's time. It's what it says it is, and WELL WORTH the download.

Thanks ddickie, keep the good stuff coming.

And know there are people who are appreciative that this is in a high quality format, from a great source, with decent audio. "
,eastern876,2008-06-03T10:36Z,"If you are interested in UFOs, you will definitely want to get the following torrent: 

In the 1980s, radio station KABC carried the ground-breaking radio program ""OPEN MIND"" with host Bill Jenkins.   The subject matter covered included UFOs, alternative energy, spirituality, ancient religions, and more.   Bill Jenkins later went on to host the classic film ""THE NAKED TRUTH"" with Jordan Maxwell, upon which the current internet hit ""ZEITGEIST"" is based.

The ""Open Mind"" radio programs have not been heard in many years ... until now.   We recently came into possession of a large collection of cassette tape recordings which had been made by a loyal listener, and had them digitized into MP3s.  This is a priceless collection of otherwise unattainable radio programs.   It is being freely shared here in an effort to make sure it is not lost to  history.

,Gardengnomechomsky,2009-11-10T08:10Z,Thanks ddickie!  I've been yearning to see this again for 39 years.  This is the show that made me a sci-fi fan.  Good work and thanks again.
