,Robert Redbeard,2007-04-23T15:41Z,"No, Ashica Kim is a fake. He just made a bunch of books during the Ninja Craze in the 80's to get some fast cash before anyone knew better than to listen to him. Hatsumi and Hayse are the ones to liik for."

,Herr.Pilsken,2007-06-16T20:16Z,"Thanks For these books can't wait to read them.
I would just like to point something out to all the people downloading these books in hopes of learning the ""secrets"" of a one of these martial-arts, You can't learn martial arts from books, they are great once you have gotten started or to get you intressed but to really get something out of them you should have trained awhile.
Atleast this is what I have come to realise.
To sum it up download these then read one or two of them after you have done that locate a dojo you think has a nice atmosphere and try a couple of classes."
