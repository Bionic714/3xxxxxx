,bhutan_6,2011-08-17T22:25Z,Can any one seed please. A bunch of us are stuck in 90%. Please seed and I'll continue to seed until everyone in done. And also can anyone upload Viewtiful Joe 2 Gamecube NTSC. Thx
,yuurf,2011-11-05T18:05Z,I honestly created an account just for this.  I'm 256 KB away from finishing the download.  It would be wonderful if you could just re-seed it for even a couple minutes.  Thanks again.  I will seed for an extended period of time if you do this.
,yuurf,2011-11-06T09:49Z,Thank you so much.  I will seed as long as there's leechers.
