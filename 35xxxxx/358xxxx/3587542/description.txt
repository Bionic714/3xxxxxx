info:
another high-bitrate DivX rip; intended to provide minimal degradation with decent compression. although it is known that Vivian Kubrick made a documentary about it, I was unable to properly rip it.

system requirements:
1.3 Ghz processor, 32 MB graphics card ; 5.1 speakers highly recommended.

seeding:
only this week; possibly sometimes later. get it while it's hot!

credo:
"I know you're out there. I can feel you now. I know that you're afraid, you're afraid of us, you're afraid of change. I don't know the future. I didn't came here to tell you how this is going to end. I came here to tell you how it's going to begin.

I'm going to hang up this phone and then I'm going to show these people what you don't want them to see. I'm going to show them a world without you, a world without rules and controls, without borders or boundaries, a world, where anything is possible. Where we go from there, this is a choice I leave to you."		ssible. Where we go from there, this is a choice I leave to you."	

Enjoy ;-)
