[V],iggy.stooge,2007-01-01T13:22Z,Wrong section. Hardly any DVD-R :)
,asp4dos,2007-01-01T23:43Z,"well it's not a 700 MB piece of crap either, and I'm not moving it. you still need a dvd-r to store it and you can view it on a stand-alone player like I did."

Maybe, but the Administrator is dictatorious.
He ban you without no warning, or reason after you have donated money.
He won't take no critics.
I think he is a little spoiled child.
So beware, don't quistion ther metode, and think before you donate."
,asp4dos,2007-01-04T22:25Z,so when I see the green pirate symbol I should be nice and quiet? Okie ;-)
,asp4dos,2007-01-07T12:49Z,"seeding has now ended; I have given it ALL of my bandwidth over the last days, so from now if it is not 100 % available, blame all those who have downloaded and wont seed it anymore."

,asp4dos,2008-06-24T11:21Z,"the image is exactly as on the dvd. it was 4/3 there, it is 4/3 here."
,Ncodia,2008-10-05T11:51Z,Hi! I was wondering whether you could please seed...
