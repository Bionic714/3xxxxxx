Step Right Up was named "Tribute Album of the Year" in 1995 by Tower's Pulse! Magazine. 

I Hope That I Don't Fall In Love With You as recorded by 10,000 Maniacs, is not available on any 

other CD. It was originally released as a cassette-only b-side to "Candy Everybody Wants" in 

1992. 

Pasties and a G-String was Jeffrey Lee Pierce's final recording ever before his tragic and 

untimely death in April, 1996. 

Tim Buckley recorded Martha in mid-1973, just as Waits' first album was being released on Asylum 

Records. This is the first cover of a Waits song ever, to our knowledge. In those days, Tim and 

Tom played on the same record company softball team! 

The front cover of Step Right Up features a rare photo of the Tropicana Motel, where Waits lived 

in the early 1970s. The photo is courtesy of Art Fein. 

The original recording of Mockin' Bird by Waits only appears on "The Early Years Vol. 2." It is 

recorded here by Tindersticks.
