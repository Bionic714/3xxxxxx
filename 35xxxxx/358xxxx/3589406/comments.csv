,eric88,2007-01-04T13:02Z,The versions at popcorn-song.com aren't the full versions. But it's a great site about the best melody ever composed!
,Twinrehz,2007-01-21T22:20Z,"Dude, you're missing THE best version!

M&H Band - Popcorn (Remix Version Special DJ)

Often found under the name of Jean Michel Jarre, it's 6:59 long (can also be found as 6:57 long, with a slight glitch somewhere in the song), and I haven't been able to find it in any other bitrate than 128kbps. It's mentioned on the site http://www.popcorn-song.com/"
,L0L3R,2007-02-28T16:26Z,seed plz
,faanvet,2007-04-07T19:47Z,"twinrehz, The H&M version is there.
As you mentioned about the mistakes that it's composed by Jarre (listed as 06), there's the mistake that it's composed by kraftwerk also (listed as 09 above).
Neither of these two groups/musicians have done covers of popcorn so propaply both (06 and 09 is H&M)

But for me the original will always be the one with hot butter.

Keep poppin...."
