,Nelly4Vitality,2007-08-19T15:38Z,"Use softpedia.com

But it is developed by some students on washington college, and only a beta. Take azereus instead. 

(If u r really keen on BitTyrant, then you can download it from softpedia. And use it on mac and pc)

But use piratebay.org!

Half of the torrents on softpedia is shareware "
