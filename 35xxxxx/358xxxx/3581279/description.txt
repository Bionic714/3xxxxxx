One of the best thrash releases ever in my opinion. This, the second album from UkÂ´s Sabbat, is an epic concept album full of aggressive and technical songs with masterful vocal from Martin Walkyier (Skyclad) spitting out lyrics like there is no tomorrow. This is a true masterpiece in 80s thrash metal history!
