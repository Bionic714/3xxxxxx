[V],Kuthumi,2008-01-23T08:15Z,"I have seeded this when necessary for over a year now, because I think it is a valuable film showing Hopkins' outstanding acting qualities already early in his career. Who else could be better qualified to portray our foremost symbol of evil, than the later Hannibal Lechter? 
But I have never seen such an example of hit-and-runners. I start to suspect that most people downloading this film are more interested in Hitler than acting, so I might stop seeding soon..."

,Pirate_P,2011-04-11T08:04Z,"Please Please Seed.

I understand you have slow upload. Maybe you could get a seed box. 

Google seed box. Once uploaded to the seed box it would be available at high speed. :-)"
