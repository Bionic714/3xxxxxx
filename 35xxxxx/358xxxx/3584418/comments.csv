,eggewert2,2006-12-26T20:47Z,Awesome! What are the demo features? 30 mins usage? 2 weeks? embedded noise signals? Or better still -- have you 'tweaked' it?
,deg,2006-12-26T20:53Z,"it´s not fixed. It´s the same demo file from the refx site. You can use it for 30min, silence every 20sec and you don´t get all the presets. But still it kicks ass =D"
,jacoweb,2007-02-07T10:20Z,"If you look at http://refx.net/?page=Nexus

Default presets is 650! so, you have enoght presets to browse in the full version of nexus."
,Zyriak,2007-02-26T22:29Z,Good idea to try to help ppl. but even if it takes 2 hours to download it from Refx.net  it takes 4 weeks to download it from here :P
