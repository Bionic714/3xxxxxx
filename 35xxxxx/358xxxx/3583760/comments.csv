,dhstec,2006-12-31T09:49Z,Excellent picture quality and excellent sound.  Worth the download.
,sterioskull,2007-01-02T22:58Z,"shit hot quality, been waiting for this!!"
,Amerialb,2007-01-07T02:58Z,"Thank you for the upload, I now know not to pay good money to see this piece of crap that shows only hopelessness. "
,CuZo,2007-01-07T04:13Z,tanks 4 da wuk
,rorsha,2007-01-09T10:19Z,excellent movie! this is a must see.Thanx
,screenslave,2007-01-11T21:58Z,"A film greatly anticipated, but quite a disappointment - a very bleak and weak look into the not-too-distant future. Some terrific scenery and what could-have-been an interesting story, but despite Clive Owen the movie soon turns into a death struggle. It goes nowhere. Afterwards it's like ""Oh, so it ended there...well, what happened?"". A lot of good ideas wasted in the end, too heavy on the symbolism and with a lot of reference to, f.i, The Bible & Jesus, V for Vendetta, 1984, The Survivors (TV-show mid-70ies) plus a lot else, blended into a tasteless mix. But hey, that's just kinda my opinion."
,hentooth,2007-01-13T00:45Z,"screenslave I was also a bit disappointed with the movie, not the pic/sound quality, but the plot, but it does have it's moments, worth a watch if you don't have anything better to do"
,nephilim70,2007-01-13T02:31Z,"I also thought the movie was pretty weak. It could have been so much more than it was. It reminded me of Half Life 2 so much, I just about reinstalled the game.... Download it if you like, but don't expect too much"
,madsturbator,2007-01-13T15:21Z,I must give this movie some credit inspite of your complaining. I loved this movie it isnt what you expected and when you complain about the ending pls consider that you couldn't have endet it any better or else it would have gotten to cheesy or gloomy. This movie rox - it is beautiful and brutal YEAH!
,multii,2007-01-13T17:13Z,This movie is genius. You have to see it if you are a movie fanatic.
,newcpitate,2007-01-14T16:47Z,"Hi 
thanks for the movie!
my computer doesn't recognize the file...what extension should it be?
Thanks again

P.S. If i leave my file in my folder so others can up load (and they are ;) ) am I doing my bit to support this community? I have only been doing this for a couple of days and want to make sure I'm doing my bit. "
,Aun,2007-01-23T22:16Z,Can somebody tell my why people insist on sharing .rar files when it's completely unnecessary with bittorrent?
,Oblivion_4,2007-02-02T21:48Z,"In response to newcpitate, Please try the DivX player located here http://www.divx.com/

and in resonse to aun, your retard putting movies into the .rar file format MAKES THE FILES SMALLER which means a FASTER DOWNLOAD ok?"
,Highorbit,2008-01-28T17:17Z,"DAMN good film!
It has my favorite scene of all times..
Nearly all the bang-bang in this movie is shot in one single, five-minute scene.. an absolute no-miss.."
,corthew,2008-02-14T11:46Z,"I'm curious how much smaller putting it in a rar file really makes it since avi files are one of the best compression video formats available. Can someone let us know what massive space savings were accomplished by raring this avi? 
In my experience it is like raring a zip. "
,corthew,2008-02-15T02:29Z,"Too funny. I downloaded this movie. The RAR comes to 718MB.
They rared it to make it smaller.
The AVI is 699MB.
They actually made it bigger.
Too, Too funny."
,thisoneguy.cms,2008-02-20T12:39Z,"Funny how that works huh...

Anyway, I rarred it to upload to rapidshare...but made a torrent out of it as well..."
,corthew,2008-02-24T19:19Z,"That makes more sense than the explanation Oblivion gave.

Thanks"
,Licurgo,2008-04-21T03:31Z,"excelent movie from a genius director from my country, i cry when the soldiers stop. 
the movie is in rar because have a follower cookie 
is kinda harmeless but if you want to rid of him just make a virus analisys"
,esoa,2008-05-13T00:22Z,movie looks good.... i'll seed for a while after im done
,MementoMoriTiny,2008-06-12T01:29Z,"Interesting opinions. Frankly, this is my favorite movie."
