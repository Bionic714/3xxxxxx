,freakindawg,2008-01-13T07:51Z,Why is the sound so crappy on divx files compared to other video formats? Is it the new version of Divx or the converter? And how does anyone adjust the sound? Is there an equalizer software I can use?
,Fton_David,2008-03-03T08:02Z,"Haven't downloaded it yet, but if you mean that the volume is simply low and you need to amp it up to hear on you computer then try ""DFX Audio Enhancer"" ... worked well for me before the advent of Xbox Media Centre."
