,sefred,2007-01-04T09:22Z,is this for real and working???   if it is ty!!!
,jaimetout,2007-01-04T10:48Z,"sefred:

yes, it is very much for real, and it works flawlessly. the fact that you will not need to validate this has nothing to do with any kind of crack or anything, it's because this is a student version that was distributed by Microsoft so that students can do multiple installs in computer science classes. 

since you not need to validate, you will be able to download any and all microsoft updates just as if you had bought and validated your copy of XP. 

i couldn't believe my luck either when i first found this a few months ago."
,CursedGroin,2007-01-04T13:55Z,"Forgive a Linux user, but are Windows disks single-language or can I get this for my brother who only knows Swedish?"
,jaimetout,2007-01-04T19:49Z,"CursedGroin: I'm pretty sure that you specify a language during setup, so this should be fine."
,atarilover,2007-01-04T23:12Z,"so this is the same as xp pro/home?
just no validation?
thanks for upload"

,jawhoot,2007-01-22T10:06Z,"Downloaded this a few days ago.  Works perfect.  Best XP PRO version I've come across; and unlimited installations....

Both XP PRO and XP Media versions ... but I have not tried the media version ."
,deLar9e,2007-02-02T22:40Z,"How about the media center edition, anyone tried that out yet, is it a properly working one with no validation fuzz also?"
,larsp,2007-02-03T13:30Z,Did a clean install on vmware. Media center doesn't start. It tells me that it only can run on a windows media center edition. Rollup2 doesn't work either as it isn't  a windows media center. xp works though.
,Pol Pot,2007-02-08T14:36Z,"26 seeders and I'm still stuck at 99,9% ?!?!?

,dev1ous,2007-06-08T14:32Z,"great copy of windows, works perfect. and i also liked the windows noir themes.. the nice black one, i also made my firefox and limewire & msn black. so looks and feels great! im very pleased with this although dont install automatic updates.. specialy the windows genuine patch.. because you will still get the msg about this copy not be'ing genuine. *note you will not be able to install windows media player 11. and IE 7 as they require a genuine windows.  other than that this copy is perfect for anyone!!  so thank you for the uploads and seeds!"
