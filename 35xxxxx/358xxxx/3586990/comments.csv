Thanx but no thanx ??"
,frorider,2006-12-31T19:02Z,Hmm.. AdAware and Spybot didn't find/found anything....
,the_borg_200,2007-02-23T22:57Z,"My virus scanners didn't detect any viruses or trojans, but the serials generated by the keygen don't turn trial into full version. 


Although ACDsee accepts the serial generated, it still only works for 30 days and then stops working. I suppose one could uninstall/reinstall every month with a different email, but you could do that anyway WITHOUT the keygen.

Also, I tried installing with internet disconnected but ACDsee won't let you. 


Sooooo . . . . SSG's big fucks fly out to everyone who brings bullshit to the scene instead of quality releases. 


. . . . guess that includes you, SSG!"
