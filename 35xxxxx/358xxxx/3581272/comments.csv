More audiobooks please!"
,kamanova,2006-12-31T01:03Z,"I really appreciate your contribution, but your upload speed really sucks. You might want to consider seeding only one torrent at a time, at least until you get a full copy out there. This ones been up for 8 days now so your avg upload is less than 2 kb/s. If you have 4 upload slots, that means .5 kb/s per peer, which is horrible.

Also, since you are the only seeder, make sure you are in Super-Seeding mode.

Please don't take offense, it was just a suggestion to help get the circulation going. :)"
