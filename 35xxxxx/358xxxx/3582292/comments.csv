I have tried and tried to burn duallayer dvds but can't seem to get them to work. Is there a way to ""open them"" and burn them on a single layer disc?"

,spawn1987,2006-12-23T13:17Z,2 kb/s :( 
,azazan,2006-12-23T16:42Z,"ok, and now im thinking we need someone with more then 7,4 % seeding on this one.
please :)"
,gmenright,2006-12-23T16:58Z,OK - I'm a newb - relatively speaking at least - but why is this downloading as an .IMG file instead of .ISO ?
,azazan,2006-12-23T17:06Z,"oh, compleeted ones ;)
I see you out there but dont get anything from you..."
,Sebgob,2006-12-24T05:55Z,"Mmmm 
Can't wait for the single-layer disc version 

Thx Mr seed0 ;)"
,gmenright,2006-12-25T03:04Z,Thanks VERY much for Disc1 - it's awesome! My wife and I are enjoying it as I type this; I've decided that downloading Disc2 would be a good idea while watching disc1 - THANK YOU!!
,JessicaSarahS,2006-12-25T04:43Z,Needs more seeds!
,gmenright,2006-12-26T03:22Z,"There will be more seeds as soon as there've been some completed downloads... there are currently about 25 of us @ around 60% or more... honestly, it could be a couple more days.

I wonder if the original seeder is using a 'super-seed' mode or not."
,1971,2006-12-31T05:03Z,"Downloaded: 129 times 
yet only 30 ppl seeding and to top it off.
giving up no more then 10kb/s??
come on folks "
,rpb113n,2007-01-18T08:06Z,"""but why is this downloading as an .IMG file instead of .ISO ?""

wondering the same thing..."
,noir.na,2007-01-22T05:05Z,"If you're concerned about the .img file, once it's downloaded, if you have any problems, you should be able to simply change .img to .iso and burn it with Nero."
,xjb119,2007-03-12T00:21Z,"I've tried using Nero and DVDDecrypter both and have still not had a successful burn. Nero gives the error that the compilation is too big to fit on a disc, yet I'm using a Verbatim Dual Layer disc. DVDDecrypter burned the disc, but it was unreadable on both my pc and set top player. I used ImgBurn and it gives the error that there are no cells that are suitable for the layer break. Has anyone else had any of these problems? Help!

Also, thanks for seeding this!"
,S04p,2007-03-26T00:30Z,"If you're having trouble burning the .img file to a DVD+R DL DVD (I'd like to take this opportunity to strongly suggest Verbatim, since they're the only DL media right now that don't suck) it simply means the layer break information is not correct or missing from the .img file. This DOES NOT mean it can't be burned.

All you'll need is a simple image mounting tool like Alcohol 120% or Daemon Tools. Mount the image as a virtual drive, load up Imgburn, select Build Mode, and use the ""add a folder"" button to add the root folder of the virtual drive. Once you've done that, make sure you've selected ""ISO9660 + UDF"" as the file system, enter the necessary volume labels (if you want), and burn the thing. Heck, if you want to even make an ISO image with the proper layer break information before you burn, you can do that too so you won't have to go through this procedure again if you want to make more copies.

Happy burning."
,S04p,2007-03-27T09:46Z,"If that method doesn't work for you, try copying the DVD files to your hard drive via your virtual drive. Then use a free program called PgcEdit to rearrange the order of the title sets. Good luck."
,sebzapata,2007-04-26T23:57Z,"I am not sure about this because i dont think i have downloaded a dual layer dvd before but in dvd shrink you can open a disc image (Ctrl+I). then could you take out the languages ou dont want and stuff and burn it to a single layer dvd? 


anyone know what to do? thanks."
,sebzapata,2007-04-27T00:00Z,"here is a good website for pcgedit

,guppygrrl,2007-06-07T19:25Z,are there still plans for the single-layer version to be released?
,scrapsoflife,2007-07-28T18:01Z,"I haven't tried to burn this paticular file yet, but for .img files in the past I just used CloneCD. It's small, VERY basic, and I used to use it to burn playstation games for a friend. Once I get some DVDs I'll try this and let you know."
,scrapsoflife,2007-07-28T18:03Z,"Also, I'll seed this until I upload the equivilant size of each file. You're welcome."
,Depdep,2007-10-18T09:13Z,"Thank you.
Very Much.
For this.

People, stop complaining, learn how to work your machines.
This is one of the best torrents ever.
Thank you."

,rustynotarednek,2008-05-13T02:53Z,"could someone please seed this for a few days, activity has stopped altogether before it finished"
,rustynotarednek,2008-05-16T05:01Z,"keep seeding guys, just a few more days.  i will seed this for at least a week when i finish."
,rustynotarednek,2008-05-19T01:13Z,"more seedage please, my internet kinda sux

,figrindan,2010-06-26T16:51Z,"Thank you, seed0.  You rock!"
,jerrywexler,2011-08-15T10:47Z,"This is amazing. I bought Closure the day it came out. I loaned my tapes to a friend and never saw them again. I bought another set, kept them a while, loaned them, never saw those again either lol (you'd have thought I'd learn a lesson)

When I first found this torrent I was elated.

It had 2 seeders when I found it, and it took me over a month to get both of these discs and broken.

I have to say, it was worth every second of waiting.

seed0, you're a hero! "
