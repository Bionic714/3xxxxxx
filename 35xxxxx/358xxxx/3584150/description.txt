About this Series:

In a future where blood-thirsty werewolves and mutants roam the countryside killing anyone foolish enough to leave the protection of city walls, the only hope for humans are the Vampire Hunters. When a young woman is bitten by a powerful vampire lord she hires a Vampire Hunter named 'D' who is particularly suited for battling demons... 

Release Notes:

When darkness falls, the hunt begins. D has been hired to track down Meier Link, a notoriously powerful vampire who has abducted a human woman, Charlotte Elbourne. D's order are strict - find Charlotte, at any cost. For the first time, D faces serious competition. The Markus Brothers, a family of Vampire Hunters, were hired for the same bounty. D must intercept Meier and conquer hostile forces on all sides in a deadly race against time. Despised by Vampires for his profession and by Humans for the blood in his veins, D relentlessly pursues his prey for a price. "...An Apocalyptic Epic." DAILY HERALD - Dann Gire, "...A visual poetry that's refreshing." VARIETY - Derek Elley
