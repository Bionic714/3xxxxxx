,Volryn666,2008-07-19T15:05Z,"Dude, wtf. I know that this is in compressed rar format and everything, but at least say if its good qual or not. And for info for rosetta and bag. Go download winrar (you can probably find a full version with a crack on this site somewhere, just do a search. Then just drag one of the numbered files to winrar and open it and just drag that shit to your desktop or something, there ya go)

so iso right? or just mpeg or avi or something, cause i wanna be able to burn it on dvd, even though i bought it legally on itunes and everything, and i have the wire for my ipod to hook to the telly, but i wanna be able to have a dvd of it too so the quality is good on my widescreen. Can someone tell me?"

,10stinkyfingers,2011-03-04T07:52Z,WinRAR wont open these. It says I need to insert a disk with the volume and press OK to try again. I've tried every one of them.
