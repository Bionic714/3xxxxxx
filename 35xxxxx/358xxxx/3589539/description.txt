BHA B'S Recorder Gold is a nice software to record CD's/DVD's, as it produces excellent results and may be an interesting alternative thinking about well known Nero or Alcohol. You can find some functions I mind you'll aprecciate. Example: Rip function extracts an *.IMG file from your CD/DVD with a "simple click", through it's easy-to-use interface wizard. Serial nummber is embbeded on installation process. Enjoy.
