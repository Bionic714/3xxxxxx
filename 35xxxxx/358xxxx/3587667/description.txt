Home Grown - Almost full discography

Albums:
That's Business
Act Your Age
Kings Of Pop

EP:
Wusappening
Phone Home
Connection
When It All Comes Down

Single:
Surfer Girl
You're Not Alone

All these were ripped from original CDs at 320k/s

I know that japanese version of Kings Of Pop, which I don't own,
has two extra tracks. One of them, Break Me Down,
is on Single You're Not Alone, included. So that's only one track missing.

Japanese version of Act Your Age also has a bonus track, The hearing song.
I ignore if it's the same version on That's Business or a newer one.

Connection is an Ep splited with another band named Limbeck,
so half of the tracks are not by Home Grown.

Surfer Girl Single is totaly useless.

Some of the extra songs are not complete.

They are from various artists album, tribute songs or holidays special.
So it's not a full discography, but it's the most complete available as far as I know.

If you think this band sucks, good for you, no need to post any comment to say it.

Enjoy.
