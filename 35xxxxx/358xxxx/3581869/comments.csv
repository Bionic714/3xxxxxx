,caper454,2008-02-27T21:02Z,"The difference between this and the original is that this has 2 extra songs, Aggressive Perfector and the Criminally Insane Remix. I would have thought the ""Bonus Track"" notation would have been a giveaway."

,orsoncart67,2009-03-18T22:00Z,"samsaantana
d/load the flac version and stop whing cus this is FREE!!!
FLAC is Free Lossless Audio Codec
hence exact copy of disc!!!"
,audiux,2010-05-26T03:03Z,"Listen up faggots! I'm sick of hearing ppl bitch about 192k ULs, so here's some fucking truth for you stupid sacks of swill: 192k is the same bitrate that audio CDs are tracked in, therefore, 192k is cd quality. Don't believe me? ask any audio engineer in the music industry. Newer albums are tracked at higher bitrates, but all cd releases are 192k, at 41khz. the only way to get better quality is to go pick up the HD audio shit like DVD albums, which are rare, or to get a file that is ripped directly from the in studio masters. So for a release like Reign In Blood, it's pointless to go for lossless audio because the masters themselves were in 192k.

@samsaatana:
Next time get your facts straight before you open your big mouth and show everyone how ignorant you really are. So now I have to ask YOU: WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOUR EARS?!"
