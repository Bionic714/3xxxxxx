Corel Paint Shop Pro Photo XI - v11.0 - Keygen

1) Unzip, unrar.

2) Disable the network before installation and don\'t enable it back before you\'ll      
   activate the program.
 
3) Run the keygen and install Paint Shop Pro using the serial number from keygen (you
   can either use \"Already have trial serial\" field or press \"Phone Corel\" button and
   enter serial there).

4) DON\'T GENERATE NEW SERIAL AND DON\'T CLOSE KEYGEN UNTIL FINISHING ACTIVATION OR 
   YOU\'LL HAVE TO REINSTALL APPLICATION ONCE MORE.

5) After the first run you will be asked to activate application.

6) Use offline activation by phone, copy installation ID (w/o dashes!) to the keygen
   (at this point you must have same serial in application and in keygen, that\'s           
   why you should not generate a new one or close keygen) and generate activation 
   code.

7)Paste activation code to application and activate the program. 

That\'s All.
