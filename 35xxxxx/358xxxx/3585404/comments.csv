Occult means ""hidden"" and so ""Occult Studies"" is one who studies hidden truth. Hidden truth has a long history of becoming accepted truth. The earth being round was hidden from those who did not have the tools to measure its curvature, or lauch a satalite into space. I find that more often, a ""moron"" is somebody who posts comments online, without truely understanding the topic about which they speak. "
