,Lepowski,2007-10-30T19:29Z,Truly awsome film! Thanks!
,sushiplatter,2008-01-24T02:24Z,What program are you using to add the subtitles to movie.  I want to burn to DVD but can't add subtitles.  Thanks
,angelinadekirk,2008-02-07T08:35Z,"Hi, Does any know where to find the subtitles in English. I cant watch this film if it doesnt have english subs."
,Pirate_Bay_Rules,2008-02-13T20:07Z,"@angelinadekirk

The subtitles are in three languages - Portuguese, English and Espanol (Yes, all in the same sub file). If you use VLC Media Player, just play the video, right-click -> Subtitles -> English. If you are running VobSub for subtitles - start the video,  right click the VobSub (green arrow) icon in the system tray and choose English. If you are using another software for subtitles, try and find out how to play a particular language from a sub file which has multiple language.

I had almost deleted the avi when opened it and found the non-english subtitles. Found this post while looking for english sub downloads. Then this possibility of multiple subs hit me. The info should have mentioned these three languages."

,scrumpiest,2010-01-14T16:46Z,"@Pirate_Bay_Rules
Thanks for that, almost deleted it thinking there weren't english subs!

Minor addition though - for VLS it's right click -> video -> subtitles -> Track -> English

And many many thanks to iggypop!"
