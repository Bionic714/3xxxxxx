  And do you even in your wildest dreams think that Iraq is a better country now then it was during Husseins command?
  Hussein made taskes like infrastracture and education important during his command. He held away the civil war away though his methods were extreme, brutal and unconsistently.
  But the reason america went to war against him and all the Iraqi's were that he made the oil foundations to be owned by the Iraqi's and not by the big american companys."

,mogura,2007-01-01T03:09Z,"Gormdengamle, consider this; allthough Saddam undoubtedly was a ruthless dictator, the Iraqi people in general fared far better during his regime than now. Saddam managed to keep Iraq united, despite the significant ethnic and religious divides in the country; now, due to the ignorant misjudgements of the Bush administration, Iraq is in Civil War. Furthermore, Saddam established the best educational system in the Middle East (he even received a price from UNESCO for his achievements), and abolished Sharia during the most of his reign. Iraq also used to be the country with the most liberal legislation concerning women; they had for instance the same right as men to education, and several Iraqi women became well-educated and acquired important positions. Due to the lack of Sharia and the establishment of a secular state, the Hussein regime was a lot more tolerant in religious matters than other Middle Eastern countries like Saudi Arabia (through conservative wahabism) and Iran (through Islamism), both two of the most repressing Muslim nations of the world to this day. Today, Iraqi society is being increasingly subject to Iranian influence, inter alia resulting in more religious fundamentalism (particularly shi'ite) and thereby terrorism, and leading to less freedom for women. For instance, the use of veil is increasingly considered necessary for women's safety in many areas of Iraq. I'm not by this saying that Saddam Hussein was a nice guy, considering both the political repression in Iraq itself as well as the wars he waged against Iran and Kuwait. But he wasn?t any ?worse? than any given US or Soviet government was during the Cold War, probably far less in grand total. The misdeeds of Saddam?s 30 year regime has probably been blown up and exaggerated in the Western media to the extent that the image of Saddam?s rule has been negatively distorted to something worse than it actually was in many people?s minds, even though it definitely was a repressing regime. 

Much of the suffering of the Iraqi health care system after the Gulf War, for example, was first and foremost the result of the international blockade against Iraq and not Saddam Hussein's policy per se. The picture is far more complex (certainly far more so than I'm portraying here), and the ""good guy/bad guy"" division you make between Saddam Hussein and George W. Bush is just plain stupid. 

Regarding ""the Good Guys back in the US of A"" you should consider this;
In the aftermath of the Iranian revolution in 1979, Saddam Hussein became one of the most important allies of the United States in the Gulf. It's true that he had some vague ties to the Soviet Union before, but from here on onwards to the late 80's, USA cooperated with Saddam's regime willingly, and even helped fuelling the Iraqi war against Iran (1980-88) by providing him with weapons. USA even overtly supported Iraq?s warfare against Iran. This period, from the end of the 70?s to the end of the 80?s, the very time when USA and Iraq were allies, was the period in which Saddam committed the gist of his worst crimes. Even the gas used to gas thousands in Kurdistan is speculated to come from factories in the West who happily sold it to Saddam knowing of his repressing tendencies as a dictator. See the jolly pictures of old bastard Rummy shaking hands with Saddam yourself. Indeed, the only reason USA came in conflict with Iraq in the first place is because of the Gulf War when US oil interests were threatened. Had Iraq, say, invaded Syria or Lebanon, USA would never have intervened, and probably supported Saddam for waging war against countries supporting the Palestinians. The United States officially kept quiet when the worst crimes were committed and even supported some of them (like the Iraqi war on Iran), for then to cynically use them 20 years later, together with slandering fabrications, to rally support for an illegitimate war.

Then, in the time after 9/11 leading up to the Iraqi war, Saddam was by the redneck dipshit government of Bush slandered, ties to Al Qaida and false rumours"

,Zirak_90,2007-01-01T05:36Z,"For all of those who protects Saddam and feels sorry for him, don't be such a stupid, there's no doubt he's a son of a bitch. 

Now I'm not a Bush-fan and don't really care if he really wanted to invade Irak just for the oil bla bla bla. That they got Saddam is something he should get Nobel's peaceprice for. This bitch Saddam makes Hitler look like Mother Teresa. He doesn't deserver to be buried, they should just throw his stinky body in a sewer, that's what he deserves, if not worse."
,kaiser86,2007-01-01T05:41Z,"Very telling (and dangerous) that the men carrying out the execution chanted Maoqtador Al-Sadas name. He leads the Shiite militias - Saddams a Sunni -and is the cause of the inevietable civil war. So for all of you who claim Bush has the blood of thousands of iraqi deaths on his hands, you should actually blame the real villians - iraqis.

The yanks stopped fighting the war proper, a long time ago and has given the iraqis plenty of time and democracy to sort themselves out, but they haven't. 90% of that 650,000 dead, were caused by IRAQIS - not the us, as they are not the ones setting off car bombs and suicide bombings on women and children shopping in the market.

Now don't get me wrong here, I enjoy the casual racism/rabid anti-americanism as much as the rest of europe, but you have to put blame at the feet of the real culprits and murderers - and to blame the bush regime for the daily killings is wrong, and just gets really stupid when the only real critique you can offer on how bush fucked up is to say the that there were no wmds, the jews really blew up the wtc, etc

Give us a real solution to the problem or shut up.

,Zirak_90,2007-01-01T05:54Z,"To Mogura, u really need to know every terrible and cold-blooded things Saddam did before u judge. Seems to me u have nothing to do with how it was in Irak when Saddam ruled, I know because I was there and one of the victims.

Mogura: ""the Iraqi people in general fared far better during his regime than now""

Oh really, how come many people visit their old country now and not then, cause now they can. When I lived in Irak when Saddam controlled, we were isolated and couldn't move from that little place we lived in.  I know u hear about so many explosions in Irak 24/7, but that also happened before the war, but it's just that they didn't write about that in the newspapers, trust me I've seen it and was nearly death several times when I was like 7 years old. No matter how it's like in todays Irak it's still better than before cuz Saddam isn't the president.

U also said: Saddam managed to keep Iraq united

United? It's obivously u haven't read the facts well. The Kurds where isolated in the North with no rights and many of them got killed totally innocent, not to mention that most of them were women and children. The Shia-muslims were isolated and lived in the poor areas with no rights. Only the Sunni's got rights and had money, now how can u call that United??????????

Please Mogura at least know what u're talking about."

,drumbum4392,2007-01-01T06:00Z,"Zirak is also right about how there have always been bombs and killing in iraq its just that its getting more publicity now that the americans are there, and in the news its not like that my father is in the U.S army and from his experience its not how the news says it is there isn't car bombs killing many americans and children suffering in iraq as much as it was when they got there"
