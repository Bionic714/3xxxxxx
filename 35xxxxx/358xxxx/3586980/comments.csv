,unloosed,2007-01-05T18:09Z,"Dude, you have no idea what you're talking about.  The spyware must have come from another program you downloaded.  

I've downloaded and scanned this program with PC-cillin 2007, Ad-Aware Professional, Spyware Doctor, and a-squared Free.  No results, natta, nothing. "
