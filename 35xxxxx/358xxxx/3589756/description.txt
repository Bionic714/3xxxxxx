Hi *

This was requested a while back. Personally, I think it's pants but some might find it useful.

This is what they have to say about it on their website:


VoxATC is a huge advance in Flight Simulation that adds a whole new dimension to the experience.

VoxATC is the first ATC add-on for FS2004 that has been developed with integrated voice recognition.

Talk to the controllers using standard ATC phraseology and what you say will be heard.

Just like in the real world, requests must be properly constructed, instructions complied with and read back correctly.
