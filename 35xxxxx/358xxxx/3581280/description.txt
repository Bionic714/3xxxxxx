This is the one you've all been looking for... the one, the only Voudon Gnostic Workbook by Michael Bertiaux. I guarantee that this is the real deal as published by magickal childe (i.e. no illustrations) and it is every bit as fucked up as you imagined.

voodoo. sex magick. occult nuttiness. aliens. time travel. it's all here.

watch out... this is the book that almost killed Grant Morrison.
