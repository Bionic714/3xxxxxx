Or, if you REALLY can't be bothered to do that, at least recommend others to come and download it, or if you can't be bothered to do THAT, buy one or more of their albums and give this amazing band some support!"
[V],mjeith,2006-12-27T01:43Z,"I'll be happy to seed, if I only got the last 0.1%..."

,portvakten,2007-03-19T18:50Z,"hello no i have seed this one for about a month i want too share but can not more people seed this one so more people can get this great albums....

,brutalspoon,2007-03-31T14:53Z,"sorry, my computer has been excommunicated from the internet, so unless somebody else who has finished downloading it seeds, i cant help >_< i wish i could though - sorry i cant be of any help"
,brutalspoon,2007-06-01T00:06Z,"Uh, if people are still stuck on 99.9%, if you could give me the name of the song which is incomplete and i should be able to seed it from another source. Otherwise, those who have already downloaded it - there should be plenty if the download counter is to be trusted - please do the Right Thing (as far as downloading music without paying for it is right :P) and seed that last .1% for everybody else. Thanks, and sorry again for my computer being shitty :D"
,brutalspoon,2007-07-12T13:53Z,"For those interested in downloading this torrent, I forgot to mention in the description that the majority of songs are VBR (Variable Bit Rate) and play mostly at 192 kbps, however sometimes the quality does change. I have created another Edguy torrent - although it does not have as many albums (4 albums and an EP), they are all at a constant 320kpbs bitrate with 44KHz sampling, so they are much higher quality. This torrent can be found here:

,brutalspoon,2008-12-31T16:27Z,"@Krillian:
No problem - glad to have helped somebody out

@Everybody else:
Sorry guys - due to multiple OS reinstallations and file sorting my folders got all mixed up and separated, so I can't seed this any more. Hopefully the 25 seeders or so that are around are actually seeding."
