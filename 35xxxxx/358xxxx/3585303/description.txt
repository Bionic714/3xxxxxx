~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Pugliese formed his own orchestra in 1939 and made his first recordings in 1943. The Maestro was one of the very few to maintain the size of his orchestra through the lean years of the 1960s, and the 1939 lineup remained unchanged until 1968 when six of his best players, in search of work, departed to form the Sexteto Tango.

The orchestra returned to form in the 1970s and continued playing right through the 1980s, making its final recordings in 1989. 

The great popularity of the Pugliese orchestra means there are many re-issues of his work on cd and here we cover only the most significant - there are more not described here. Reliquias have made themselves the label of choice for those wanting to collect his work.

The best thing to do is collect the Pugliese cds on Reliquias. There are four instrumental albums:

    * Instrumentales Inolvidables EMI 859023
    * Instrumentales Inolvidables vol.2 EMI 499985
    * Instrumentales Inolvidables vol.3 EMI 499962
    * A Los Amigos EMI 837407

Instrumentales Inolvidables volumes 2 and 3 are fantastic albums. Each presents twenty tracks from EMI's catalogue from the 1950s and 1940s, presented in reverse chronological order. Volume 3 is probably the one to get first but there's very little in it.

Volume 1 contains the first twenty instrumentals Pugliese recorded, except La Cachila, which was included on A Los Amigos, and Vayan Saliendo which was omitted so that La Yumba could be included as the 20th track. (Never mind, it's included on volume 3). It's a unique collection.

There is a small snag with this disc, though: there are no mint condition 78s of Pugliese's 40s recordings anywhere in existence, and the noise has been filtered off which makes the music a little less involving. Comparing the transfer of La Yumba to that on Ausencia and the difference is clear.
