,torrenting,2006-12-23T00:47Z,"Very nice quality on this DVD screener. Colors are sharp and vivid, only a tad blurry at times. Resolution runs at 624x336, which is different than that of Distill's release. Audio sounds good and now in-sync. Great proper from mVs.

How to extract? Click on the left mousebutton on one of the files and then click ""Extract Here""."
,Zirak_90,2006-12-26T05:11Z,"Did a mistake, mean the right mousebutton not left."
,eterna111,2006-12-26T22:11Z,"Don't listen to what C0LDSH07 says, he's linking to an old copy of this movie, not this mVs-release. He's spamming a lot of forums, just ignore him."

[V],mikohl,2006-12-31T11:10Z,"Well well well... COLDSH07, there is no dvd-rip available of this movie. There are only dvdscreeners available. There is no way in hell a dvdrip can be made available before they actually make the damn dvd, now is there? I do not know what you're putting out for, but pls, don't make a bigger fool of yourself then you already have. Come on, saying ""fuck"" and ""hell"" in a comment to ppl you have never met (and if I'm right, you're praying to the almighty God you wont have to meet'em either) ? How about thanking the uploader or staying the fuck out of here?"
