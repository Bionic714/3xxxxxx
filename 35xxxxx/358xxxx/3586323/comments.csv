,Smoke_,2006-12-30T18:54Z,Oh my. This will totally beat the snot out of my mpeg version from years ago.
,hei1spawn1,2006-12-30T21:20Z,Is the quality of this better than the verison that came out last year?
,grumblz,2006-12-30T21:43Z,Awesome!  All I've had is a crappy VHS ripI got a long while back.  Thanks!
,ripmixburn,2006-12-31T00:15Z,"Let's hear it for NINE INCH NAILS... whoo, they're good!"
,1971,2006-12-31T05:02Z,"ppl complaining about the speeds think about it.

,JayjayAbnormal,2006-12-31T07:24Z,"From the wiki article:

but was primarily taken from an anonymously-received, low-generation copy of the tape. Like all of the copies that exist online, however, this version does not have video footage during ""Help Me I Am in Hell,""

They're talking about my version I leaked about a year and a half ago, obtained by my brother in law back in 96 when the uncut Closer video was actually considered rare.

I'll download this just because I wouldn't mind having a DVD of this"
,JayjayAbnormal,2006-12-31T07:28Z,"By rare, I meant before Closure was released. and it mightve been 97, who knows. It just sucks that I stuck my name in credit on the file, and yet people are claiming how it 'anonymously' leaked"
,JayjayAbnormal,2006-12-31T17:07Z,"Scratch the last comment. Someone else recieved a copy like mine without Help Me I Am in Hell in it, I guess"
,beckfan21,2006-12-31T21:21Z,oh my god.....i've been waiting for something like this to come out for a long time.......is it true? is the quality really that good?
,JayjayAbnormal,2006-12-31T21:57Z,"The quality is outstanding. I'm beginning to get convinced its sourced from the master.

Never thought I'd see the day where the world will see a good quality video of Gave Up."
,chelchik,2007-01-01T05:28Z,"Just finished downloading.  

Thank you so much.  Happy Holidays!"
,danno828,2007-01-07T22:34Z,just finished d/l. i tried opening it up with windows media player and nero 7 player but there is no sound. can anyone help me?
,MissMidnight,2007-01-12T07:11Z,"I'm having the same problem as danno828, I haven't tried burning it onto a DVD yet, but when I opened it with Windows Media I had no sound.  Any help?"
,MissMidnight,2007-01-12T11:09Z,"Strike the last comment from the record, I solved it myself, thanks!"
,paramnesiac,2007-01-19T21:55Z,"Holy shit.  Never thought I'd see this.

Thanks!"
,cafegrrrl,2007-01-25T08:04Z,"All i have to say is Wow! 

I just discovered this site and this is the first thing I've checked out.

I've had (and still do) a VHS bootleg of the Broken movie since shortly after it was leaked. I bought a copy of it from a kick-ass music store when I was in college. I had no idea as to how hard it was to get a copy.... 
I still watch it every once in a while. 
I still wat"
,Werm,2007-02-18T20:28Z,Got a VHS copy of this in the mid-90's from a record store in Cleveland. Must have been 5th gen+ :) I don't know where you got this or who you are but from a long time NiN fan - A big fucking THANKS!!!! (I acually dl'ed it from another site but wanted to thank the original Seed0 ).  :)
,aocrkid,2007-03-02T21:30Z,did danno828 and MissMidnight  mount it with Daemon tools?
,alienoverlord,2007-03-15T07:30Z,thank-you seed0 for being who you are
,jedcore,2007-03-23T02:14Z,How the hell do I get this to play?  It's a .img file...  What am I supposed to open it with?  I tried Nero and that doesn't work.  Now what?
,jedcore,2007-03-23T03:40Z,"Nevermind.  I figured it out.  Just needed to extract the files from the .img file.  After that it's just a simple drag and drop of the video_ts folder onto a dvd and burn it.  Burn it.  Burn it.  Burn it.  Burn BURN!
Sorry.  This video fucks with my head a bit.  This is about the best quality I've ever seen of this film."
,runkill.com,2007-04-22T20:49Z,"I know I sound like a begger but I suck at reencoding stuff and was wondering if someone could rip and release this as a divx .avi file. As I remember its only 18 minutes and could be easily fit in 200mb without quality loss. 

This is a great video, I just which it was in a format i didnt have to burn or virtualize. 

Thanks for this, Ill try to do it it myself but I have Vista and it cripples many burning and ripping progz."
,runkill.com,2007-04-22T20:54Z,"In return, heres my contribution to all you NIN fans out there, 28 NIN Music Videos. http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3667586/Nine_Inch_Nails_Videography_-_28_NIN_Music_Videos"
,runkill.com,2007-04-25T06:24Z,I did it! Ripped this DVD to an .avi file at only 80mb with little loss. Enjoy http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3672627
,kd10774,2007-05-06T09:46Z,"Love the Video quality, maybe i'm doing this wrong but where's tha sound?"
,sven2861,2007-05-21T06:45Z,I'm so confused. I can't get this from a .img file into something burnable. Or am I supposed to burn the entire .img file?
,kins138,2007-05-22T07:44Z,"WTF! 
help im new to the site, etc etc etc (and apparently tech. challenged!)
how the hell do i do this and get it to work i downladed it but no broken!!
can somebody help me step by step?
THANKS!!!"
,kins138,2007-05-22T07:44Z,also is there anyway to transfer this to itunes?
,president_Bob,2007-06-19T20:43Z,"am i correct in saying that there is NO video for ""Last""?

im almost 100% sure there isnt, cause im working this into the COMPLETE discography/videography im about to post up here :]"
,generation_apathy,2007-12-07T01:14Z,"Hrm... Looking at wiki, seed0 is suspected to be Trent...  Oh well, I just wanted to note how the listings are not capitalized.  That's something I've noticed with Trent's music, is that he won't capitalize songs/tracks, etc.  Also, he makes mention to wiki, and that's something I would suspect of Trent (steal my music and all).  I don't know.  Just something to mull over.  Oh well, thanks to Trent for this, and seed0, if you are Trent, or just another person, thank you very much.  I am very grateful for this.  Good luck to Trent and congrats on breaking from your record label. "
,Lenorethm,2007-12-19T07:06Z,"Too awesome. I salute you. 
Can't wait to see this properly, not off dodgy youtube."
,R4W,2007-12-28T00:45Z,"Ah, the infamous seed0. (:"
,nashmunsh,2008-01-21T05:42Z,well the video quality was gr8 except for the snuff footage... and works just fine using PowerISO to extract image file
,RETyrant,2008-02-15T21:33Z,I have the CD (.wma) and movie (.avi & .divx) available for download.
,Instrumentallyinsane,2008-02-16T17:19Z,"One of the finest examples of torrent files.  Thank you, Trent!"
,CBass99,2008-03-07T18:11Z,"My oh my, no more shitty You Tube quality shit! Thank you, Seed0 (Trent). You really are a credit to the music industry, the torrent industry, and simply a good guy. "
,giggleloop,2008-03-11T16:15Z,"Thanks ""seed0"". ;) You're awesome. Can't wait to download these and watch them -- and I'm loving Ghosts. Rock on, man."
,MeXPaiN,2008-03-12T15:39Z,Thank you SO much Trent!
,itchino1,2008-03-20T15:43Z,Cool many thanks to seed0 and all the seeders. 
,james_97223,2008-04-29T00:21Z,thank you for sharing and i'll seed too
,SegaShaheen,2008-05-03T14:15Z,I seen the VOB format that I convert the AVI format already! ^_^
,finallynin,2008-07-20T11:03Z,"Hi there - If anyone has the ""Seed 1"" Release called ""Collected"" (you know what I mean) 
PLEASE SEED AGAIN ... this one is almost unfindable on the net and the one seeding here at PB is stucking and not started since several days! I really want that one

THANKS"
,mister_playboy,2008-08-09T08:01Z,"Wikipedia stats that the .img file type is used for creating disk images of floppy disks, allowing the data to be transmitted digitally.

This makes sense, as we are dealing with material from 15 years ago.  There isn't much software support for this format anymore, however."
,CobyJames,2008-08-18T03:19Z,dont download this shit. just look up the dvd
,dartmouth,2008-09-11T02:46Z,"two of the worst comments i've ever seen?

.img is just another .iso format, i think some of them can even be just renamed to .iso and work (not sure if that's the case here) but this has nothing to do with floppy disks.  did you really think there'd be 1,000 floppy disk images you'd have to paste together to get a dvd out of this?  also 'don't download this, look up the dvd' ..wow, that's really just beyond the normal spectrum of stupidity.  i think you might want to be posting comments on youtube, you'd probably fit in better there."
,daveyjones1111,2008-11-15T22:48Z,Thank you Trent.
,dunxd,2008-12-13T00:22Z,"This blew me away.

I watched the whole thing, and it kept me awake for a couple of nights.  Truly disturbing, and I'm not surprised it didn't get an official release.

Mind you, that this thing would get passed around as ever degrading VHS copies seems to me to be the point.  So if you are re-encoding this to make it smaller, do a shitty job - it makes it all the more authentic :-)

Not one to leave lying around where your kids can find it..."
,weitulong,2009-01-13T09:01Z,"HELP! Any reason why this burns fine but won't playback in dvd player? 

DVD Shrink > Phillips Lightscribe DVD-R > Emerson DVD Player/Recorder. 

It also won't play back in DVD drive on computer."
,weitulong,2009-01-14T01:28Z,"Ok, so this thing plays fine in Shrink, but when I burn it, I also get no sound and it only plays about 20 seconds of the intro and loops. 

Any suggestions?"
,weitulong,2009-01-14T06:23Z,"Well I'm an idiot! (Or drunk. Sometimes both, definitely interchangeable.) I found the application in Nero to burn image files and this burned at max speed (16x) in less than a minute. And it works! 

So what is wrong with DVD Shrink?"
,deftonesmx17,2009-07-31T00:30Z,"Trent.....I mean seed0, you are a god among artists; not just because of your work, but also because you actually give a damn about getting your work into the hands of your fans."
,mrfracas,2009-08-05T00:11Z,Legend! This is what I've been waiting for... uninterupted Broken. :D
,abyss93,2010-06-10T09:02Z,Thanks! I've wanted a copy of this for years. I will definitely seed.
,masterp90,2010-11-06T19:11Z,Trent Reznor is that you behind the ''seed0'' user?
,skrjj,2011-01-21T08:23Z,"Thank you seed0!!!!!!!!
Everything about this is super high quality, I will seed as long as possible."
,13beat,2011-02-07T19:19Z,thanks
,Catatonicat,2011-06-08T09:32Z,It might jolly well be Trent behind the user's name. Giving his policy on releasing stuff for free I wouldn't be surprised.
,disarraygun,2011-11-22T07:45Z,"Holy crap! I haven't seen this in 15 years...

My copy, which I still have, was given to me by a kid on the bus who knew NIN was my favorite band.

Watching it with no context whatsoever, I ended up not able to sleep for a couple of nights.

Thanks so much for the upload!

I am still left wondering: Do I really want to download this?"
,disarraygun,2011-11-22T07:47Z,"...and i suppose the answer is ""yes..."""
,mkyl428,2012-02-09T22:24Z,"Thank you so much Trent I mean ""seed0"" lol great quality video! I loved it a true work of art, keep up the good work YOU ROCK!!!!!!!!!!!!"
,dopestar75,2012-05-11T16:46Z,was having a problem with opening the file. all i did was change the .img to .iso. then opened it with winrar. played it with vlc (use the video_ts file). definitely way better quality than what i dl'ed 3yrs ago. btw seed0 is trent. if u ain't figured it out he left clues. for the most part seed0 has had this torrent up for 6yrs. who the fuck does that??? trent does. he must be hiding the original torrent file in sum null corp. server. also this version doesnt have trents water marks that he originally used on the original vcr tapes. go to the broken movie wiki page and u can read more about the marks. only one copy had no marks. trents copy. booyeah!
