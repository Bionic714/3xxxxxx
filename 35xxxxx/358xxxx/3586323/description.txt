NINE INCH NAILS: BROKEN
Original "release": 1993

Unofficial DVD Release [halo 5 dvd]

In 1992, Nine Inch Nails released the "Broken" EP.  It was followed in 1993 by a short film, roughly 20 minutes in length, known as the "Broken Movie."  Filmed and directed by Peter Christopherson, the movie wove Broken's four music videos together via a violent "snuff film," and included its own video for the song "Gave Up" as its conclusion.  Due to its extreme graphic content, the Broken Movie was never officially released (and likely never will be), but was leaked as a bootleg which became heavily traded on VHS in the 1990's, and in recent years via the internet.

This release contains the Broken Movie, in its uncensored entirety, in DVD format with the highest video quality that will likely ever be available.  Enjoy, and happy new year's.
