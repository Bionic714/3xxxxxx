Let's get something straight first. You cannot download a PSP game just because it says you can play it on your PSP. There are a LOT of things you need to account for before playing it.

1.) Firmware.
2.) Memory Stick / Internal Memory(PSP Go) Space
3.) Compatibility.

For those of you getting the ""To use this content, you must activate the system"" error, just give up. It means there is something lacking on your PSP that prevents from working. I'm assuming all of you are running on OFW(Official Firmware) when you guys encountered this error.

The 'System' it speaks of refers to your Playstation network account. I swear, just give up. Wanna know why? I'll tell you why.

1.) You are required to be signed in to PSN in order to activate the system.

2.) Even if you do manage to login to PSN and activate the system, unless you possess the necessary license for the game you just downloaded, then you're out of luck. It won't work.

I tried it before. I researched everything.

If you active the system and try to run the game, you DEFINITELY encounter this error next. 

""The copyright information for this content is invalid""

Which means that whoever owns the game you downloaded has the game activated on his/her PSP system. He/she needs to deactive them first before another person(only 1 person) can activate it. It's basically just giving away/selling a game you bought on the PSN. 

If you wanna run this without this license bullshit and all others, get a custom firmware. It will definitely work for you.

Learn the different between CFW(Custom Firmware) and OFW(Official Firmware). It will save you a lot of time."
