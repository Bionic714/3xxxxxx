,Beavernisse,2006-12-26T17:59Z,Sounds fishy... does it really work?
,IcepickTrotsky,2006-12-26T19:07Z,It works just fine. A classic game which deserves a workover like this.

[V],mrlovalova,2006-12-29T12:12Z,"Thanks for the perfect upload.

Everything works perfect, the original game runs as it should, and the hi-res version with the proper 3D (i.e. no more 2D pixel enemies etc) is just gorgeous.

Also includes the level editor and a couple of extra maps thrown in for good measure. A class act all the way!"
