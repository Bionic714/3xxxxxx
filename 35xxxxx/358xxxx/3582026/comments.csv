Not you, obviously. Why are you complaining? This is one of those things you can safely ignore and it won't hurt you, you know. How can you 'destroy' a movie like Time of the Apes? Cinematic gem that it is, it probably would have been banned as a crime against humanity by Geneva Convention were it not for the MST3K guys. 
You're my hero UMe2."
