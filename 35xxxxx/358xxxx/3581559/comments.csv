,Plexxor,2006-12-22T15:42Z,"Many Thanks JohnyFiama for posting

And you are right abt this

IMPORTANT NOTE!

Please, Do *NOT* restart your machine directly AFTER the installation. 
Make sure that you've FULLY CRACKED Eset NOD32. Then, do a restart! 
Otherwise, the crack won't work, according to some people. 


My Regards"
,JohnyFiama,2006-12-22T16:32Z,"@Plexxor: No sweat! :) Thanks for showing your appreciation! ..and for the feedback, of course! :)"
,Hypnosis4U2NV,2006-12-23T01:35Z,"Good upload..

Im running my laptop on Kaspersky 6 and Comodo v2.4.8 Firewall and my desktop is running NOD32 and Jetico v1..

My desktop is way faster with this config using a slower processor than my laptop..

These programs are way better than Norton, McAfee and ZoneAlarm..    "
,JohnyFiama,2006-12-23T16:52Z,"@Hypnosis4U2NV: Thanks mate! :) First of all, I totally agree with you about Norton, McAfee and ZoneAlarm. Those softwares are just too commercial, and they lack to offer the stability that most users demand nowadays.
Unfortunately, I havn't had a chance to try Comodo as software firewall. Some people suggest that it is very good. But, it falls short to the major leak tests, which is pity. On that note, Jetico Personal Firewall has been proven to be the most secure personal firewall application, although its logging functionality sucks. Here's an excellent reference: http://www.firewallleaktester.com/software.htm
I must say that you have a very good sense of security. But, after all, layered security is the way to go, IMHO. Combining, honeypot solutions with HIPPs (Host Intrusion Prevention System) and AntiVirus/AntiSpyware/Firewall/PacketFiltering (router/software) is perhaps the most secure strategy. Well, besides running a secure OS like FreeBSD (probably the most secure one at this point of time).
I would suggest that you check back soon. I'm in the process of uploading the whole NOD32 AntiVirus System package (as ISO as well as in separate folders) soon. ..and, I'm talking about the real fish.. not some lame trial with crack, like this one. Merry Xmas and happy new year!"
,JohnyFiama,2006-12-23T17:09Z,"@Little Fingers: Thanks for your feedback! Appreciated as always. :) You are absolutely correct. But, I think TPB has pretty damn good security because things get done pretty quickly since people are not affraid of reporting abuse to admins. Some lamers like alex116, detredwings1, Lemmelin, yasashito_okamura and UK-W got their account revoked in a matter of day for spreading malwares. But, sure.. there is always risk involved when downloading materials off the Net. 
I suggest that you check back soon. I'm in the process of uploading the whole NOD32 AntiVirus System 2.7.x package (as ISO as well as in separate folders) soon. ..and, I'm talking about the big fish.. not some lame trial version with crack, like this one. Merry Xmas and happy new year! :) Well, and a virus free Xmas, of course LOL :P"
,Hypnosis4U2NV,2006-12-23T22:33Z,"JohnyFiama: Im looking forward to it.. If you get a chance check out the Comodo Firewall, its pretty nice and they are always eager in making in better.. I wouldnt be surprised if they turn out a great AV product one day.. The best thing about Comodo is that its free so theres no cracks, keygens or serials to go searching through thus elimating some risk of downloading viruses.."
,Hypnosis4U2NV,2006-12-23T22:42Z,"Ohh BTW: I believe Comodo addressed the leak testing with the newer version of their firewall which at the moment is v2.4.8.122 (beta) and v2.4.6 (release).. The review in your link used v1.1 and they made much progress since then.. I used the testing at www.grc.com to test the security of the firewall and it was very good..  I would be interested in finding a review that compares the newer versions of Comodo firewall against some of the other commercial ones out there..

For the Beta version go here: 

http://www.personalfirewall.comodo.com/download/CFP_Setup_English_2.4.8.122_BETA.exe

I think you will like it.. Afterall, theres no ALL-IN-ONE solution to security.."
,Hypnosis4U2NV,2006-12-24T05:02Z,"I think it can hold its own with some of the other good ones..

I found a link with a more recent testing and rating of leak tests for firewalls..  While Comodo is ranked first, you have to observe that not one firewall gives a total protection against leaks..  Also Jetico v2 is ranked 2nd to Comodo.. Jetico offers its version 1 firewall as shareware..

http://www.matousec.com/projects/windows-personal-firewall-analysis/leak-tests-results.php#firewalls-ratings

How can anyone go wrong with these two firewalls? Their FREE, so NO cracks, keygens or viruses when you download from their respective sites..

DonÂ´t kid yourself or anyone else! )))

I mean wtf dude, whats your point? I mean if you really wanna be helpful, and we would really appreciate that, can you for f*uks sake please be a bit precise, which would mean something like the following:

1. Which security app found the malware/trojan/etc that you are talking about.

2. Where is it's location

3. Did cross-reference check it with another security app, and also are you sure it's from this NOD32 torrent?

4. Were you able to disinfect it?
-----------------------------------

Ok all you people who post out comments like ""kamikatz"" please for f*ucks sake post out a comment that can be useful, we would all appreciate that very much.

And to all you stupid scum malware spreaders eat sh*t and die."
