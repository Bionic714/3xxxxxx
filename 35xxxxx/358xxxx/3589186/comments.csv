DON'T COUNT ON THE """"7"""" SO CALLED SEEDS... IN FACT THERE ARE NONE ::((
My ports/firewall and bittorrent client are very well configured, so I guess that the so called seeders are not connectibles,or disconnected, but what I'm sure of is that there are absolutely no seeds on this torrent."
,0xotox0,2009-02-23T07:50Z,"Found a working one (135 total seeds, 50 connected/really working seeds, that's fast).
It's the air ""discography"" containing all their albums, you can choose to download only ""pocket symphony"", and it's 320kbs mp3 (the highest mp3 quality).
