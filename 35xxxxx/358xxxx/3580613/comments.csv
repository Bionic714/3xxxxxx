Can anyone confirm this? I'm dl this now but it'd be nice if someone that already has the file could confirm it does work."
,SeedLeechPirate,2008-10-26T13:31Z,I just finished downloading this it went really fast at 600kb/s! I just want you to know that the 2 people complaining are wrong. The video and audio quality are both fine (its not dvd but w/e) and the sound works trough the whole movie (i fastforwarded to 23:50 and then trough the whole movie to make sure). Thx for the upload Yeast!

If you listen very closely you will hear some new sounds that weren't in the original. I haven't watched this movie in ages. Great movie. Great torrent."
,JustinV77,2010-10-25T03:55Z,"Starts off playing really fast and cant hear any sound on the PS3 and on the xbox 360 sound is fine for first 2 minutes then begins to skips and run choppy until it completely freezes and cannot be fixed, and no it is not a streaming issue, i copied it to my ps3 and xbox 360 hdd and same thing happened"
,RIggsta,2010-12-05T15:29Z,"works fine here on my ps3 and every other device, must be on your end..works great here 10 for both"

,tweakmode,2011-12-13T06:33Z,"well, unfortunately it does NOT play on PS3 via PS3 Media Server. So I will confirm that. It starts out playing very fast, no audio.

IT DOES play on tha computer, and quality as such is exceptionally good. Thanks!"
