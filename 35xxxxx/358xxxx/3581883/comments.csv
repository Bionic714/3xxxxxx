,MrMojo1,2007-09-22T19:47Z,"Just wondering...

If ""Hex"" is a British show, why are English subtitles needed??

It's already (spoken) in English unless the British accent is difficult to understand to some hence the English subtitles.

Or the these episodes are Not the original English versions and the English subtitles are needed.

Anyway...
Please seed! Been trying to download literally for days!

Thank you!

,Baloo2,2008-04-06T16:17Z,"MrMojo1, British English usually is no problem when all the actors are properly trained -- preferably on the theatre scene, where they are used to articulate properly.

Modern TV stars on the other hand, often uses not only difficult accents, but do not speak out properly, mumbling in a way that makes it very difficult for a non-native listener to understand without support from the subtitles.

It's like if you see a blurry picture of something you have seen before, you usually have no problem recognizing it. If you have never seen anything like it before it's a totally different ballgame.

Sometimes I even have to turn the subtitles on when I watch some Swedish (native for me) TV shows, because the vocal acting is so poor..."
,wakasashi,2010-02-16T11:41Z,i am british and i think they are speaking quite well. also LLayr if this is language thing then please bear in mind that americans took the langage with them and altered it to the point where alot of them cant understand how it should sound anymore. it is called English for a reason.
,locutus0985,2011-12-28T23:15Z,These subtitles are brutal. Many of them aren't even close to what the character said. Many of them have horrible grammar. Many are gibberish - incomprehensible - they're not English. You need to at least have someone proof-read them. At least that way you can avoid the gibberish.

You translate to english but you forgot translated into Swedish as well, not everyone can english."
