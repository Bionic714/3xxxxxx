1. Welcome to North korea - 2000.................Rating = 8/10
2. CNN- North korea undercover- 2005.............Rating = 6/10

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
They both give the same picture, its heartbreaking to see this pennalism.
I gave the CNN documentary a 6/10 because they hype it too much (infotainment).
