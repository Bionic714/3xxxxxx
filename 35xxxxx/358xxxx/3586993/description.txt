Noise meets screaming vocals as Brainbombs pummel the poor listener with lyrics straight from the collected writing of Peter Sotos.

Black Sabbath meets `The Stooges┬┤ and `Pussy Galore┬┤! With lyrics from Peter Sotos Magazine ''PURE''

The deadly Obey album from notorious Swedish fuck-ups the BRAINBOMBS. Eight festering tracks of open-sore rock damage, played simple, ugly and for maximum effect. A total car wreck, with guts spread all over the highway. Bee-yootiful.
