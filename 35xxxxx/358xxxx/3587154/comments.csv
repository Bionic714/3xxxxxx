,CoMMaNcHe,2006-12-31T16:45Z,"Do your own research.

Fire does not melt steel at 1200 degrees F.

Steel melts at 2750 degrees F.

It's a technical impossibility for steel to melt at 1200. And it will certainly not melt in a dirty un-controlled open-air kerosine-fuelled fire. "
,CoMMaNcHe,2006-12-31T16:46Z,"You cannot get a 110-story pancake collapse in 8,4 seconds (free fall speed - the speed at which an object drops through air).

Never would a pancake collapse GAIN speed and go beyond the speed of gravity, it would LOOSE speed since it would fall into the path of most resistance - the building itself. For it to fall at free fall speed the floors beneath would have to cease to exist completely BEFORE the upper floor reaches them.

George Bush and the other goons in the government can't change the laws of physics, even if they say they can.

Learn to think for yourselves. "
,All_Your_Sky,2006-12-31T17:02Z,"You dumbass, Entertainer.

The simple facts of temperatures:

* 1535ºC (2795ºF) - melting point of iron

* ~1510ºC (2750ºF) - melting point of typical structural steel

* ~825ºC (1517ºF) - maximum temperature of hydrocarbon fires burning in the atmosphere without pressurization or pre-heating (premixed fuel and air - blue flame)

Diffuse flames burn far cooler.
Oxygen-starved diffuse flames are cooler yet.

The fires in the towers were diffuse -- well below 800ºC.

Their dark smoke showed they were oxygen-starved -- particularly in the South Tower. "
,everlander2007,2006-12-31T17:13Z,"Well said All_Your_Sky, well said.

These government employed disinformation terrorists (such as entertainer, bobdaslob, tomtomx) can't stand up to cold hard facts."
,petern,2006-12-31T17:29Z,"So, a 110 story building is suppsed to stay perfectly intact untel the exacy moment the supporting steel... goes liquid? I think not.
You conspiracy dumbnuts should just grab another straw."
,goatfucker99,2006-12-31T18:17Z,So what actually happened then All_Your_Sky?
,Eark the Bunny,2007-01-01T00:59Z,"The steel does not have to melt, all it has to do is weaken. The building wasn't built to withstand such forces.  No need for extra explosives or conspiracy theories just cheap materials. Remember Occam's razor."
,xtr_Franklyn_44,2007-01-01T01:09Z,"Remember the Windsor building in Madrid, Spain (just one of many examples) before you open your little mouth and say shit you don't know anything about."
,xtr_Franklyn_44,2007-01-01T01:13Z,"No steel framed building has ever collapsed due to a fire.

Do some f*cking research."
