,tullweed,2007-09-16T17:33Z,"There seems to be a lot of confusion about 
dealing with TomToms in general and specifically the map features. 
I can tell you only about my own successful experience with this torrent.
First of all, I have one of the relatively newer Toms that has an approximate 1 GB internal memory along with a SD card slot.
I decided not to deal with the SD card issue because, number one you need a high-speed 
high-quality card and you need to know how to 
prepare it to store data properly for the Tom 
Tom. It appears that many users are able to 
put the data on the card but run into difficulties when trying to run two different maps -- some kinds of registration issues or choice issues or 
something -- I decided not to deal with that.
The very first thing I did was install the newest edition of Tom Tom home software program  from the web site -- did all the updates which brought me up to home version number two and added some nifty features to my Tom Tom -- like map share.  Sometimes you might have to disconnect, powerdown, restart your computer and run through the process once more.The point is, you want your software updated -- then you want to do a full backup to your computer... paranoid people will also do a manual backup either using Explorer or the software -- the point is you want be able to undo any mistakes you might pull off.  :-)
After storing this torrent (You should use WINRAR to decompress this file) download a 
torrent keygen found HERE:http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3686761/TT6_kg_All.z
It's called TT6_kg_All...(I tried other ones, this one worked)

You should also decompress this keygen to your desktop or something.  Inside you'll find an application file called test4 and a text file which tells you do pretty much what I'm going to tell you to do.
1) make a folder at the root of C drive (go to my computer > C drive > make a folder -- call it ""Crack"" or what ever)     2) copy ""test4"" into this folder    3) here is where many people get lost... now you need to go into the decompressed folder of the map file you downloaded (if it's this one it's called Western Europe 660.1256) and find a file called Western_Europe MIDI sequence and copy it to the crack folder... you can put the text file in there as well if you like 4) so now you should have at least two and possibly three files in that folder. 4) if you don't know anything about Windows or DOS files, find a geek to help you.. but here is the process > press Start>run> type cmd which will bring up a ""DOS box"" which is old-style black background with white text>type CD C:\ (must be a space between CD and C:\) and press enter on keyboard) you will now be at the famous C prompt (C:\>) and you now need to type CD Crack (or what ever you named your folder -- just make sure there's a space between CD and folder name) you should now be at C:\Crack>...now type test4 Western_Europe.mid and hit enter (make sure you have a space between test4 and the rest and make sure you're using the_underscore and .mid 5) if you are successful you should see the following text:  Enter Device ID 6) most of you know how to find this -- if not refer to the Tom Tom web site or simply (before all this) power up your Tom Tom and find the ""show version"" under the preferences... it will be a capitalized set of 10 letters... so you need to enter this  set of 10 letters into the DOS box -- it doesn't matter if there is a space between the first five and the last five... you will now have three activation codes, one for Palm, one for pocket, and one for One/Go... write down the appropriate one.

Almost done -- now you're going to delete your original maps off your device (remember you made a backup, didn't you?  :-)) -- the best way to do this is to use the Tom Tom software believe it or not because it will remember that you deleted it and it will remember where the backup is stored in case you screw up).
NEXT you're not going to use the Tom Tom software to install the new map -- you should exit the software but leave the Tom plugged into the USB port on your compu"
,tullweed,2007-09-16T17:59Z,"FY I -- I have a TomTom One -- purchased at RadioShack about six months ago -- it does have a card slot but he is not being used because the North American maps are preloaded on the hard drive. If it is as simple as placing other maps on a card, running the key generator, and registering them -- that would be great -- however, I was under the impression that I had to place a copy of the tom-tom software on the new card... can anyone confirm?

Would ideally like to get all West Europe on one instead of only Scandinavia... experiences and/or advice warmly welcomed. Thank-you for reading this. 
,Philipp5,2008-01-12T06:59Z,"Worked for me. This is how I did it on my TomTom One SE (similar to TT One V2):

1. Format a 1 GB SD Card with FAT.  Stick it into the TomTom One SE. 
2. Start TomTom Home (TTH) and then turn on the TomTom. Let TTH check for updates and then 
3. allow it to download and install software version 6.5 (even though my One SE should come with version 7 (new edition), I felt it would be better to stick with 6 to be compatible with this version 6 map).   
4. Unzip the files from this torrent to any directory and run the keygen (http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3719683/TomTom_Keygen). 
4a. To run the keygen, copy the key.exe file into the same directory as the maps and then give the following command: ""key Western_Europe.mid"" in the Command prompt.
5. Copy the files contained in this torrent to the SD card in a directory that you can name as you want (you can do it while connected to the TomTom or through a separate card reader). I created the directory WesternEurope in the SD card root.
6. Once copied, just power on the TomTom with the SD card inside and it will boot from it and after a couple of reboots ask for the Activation.  Enter it with spaces just like in the keygen and you're done!  

If you want to go back to the original US/Canada maps, then just turn the TomTom off, remove the SD card, and then power it back on.

I'm only doing this since the maps are too expensive to warrant for a short vacation, if you are going to be using them for longer please PAY for them to support this great software.

By the way: I tried version 6.75 maps from other torrents thinking they are newer, but they did not work on my device."
,puttingau,2008-02-25T10:56Z,"this worked for me with ipaq 5765 travel companion-some notes I made.
These are my notes that worked for ipaq 5765 pda, thanks tullweed and philip5
1. the hardest part was finding the device code, ended up being in tomtom home menu 

help/configuration Information.

2. Unzip the files from this torrent 

(http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3585390/TomTom_6_Western_Europe_660.1256.zip) to any 

directory and run the keygen (http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3686761/TT6_kg_All.zip).
This keygen worked for me, whislt the other did not because it gave a separate one for 

pocket pc.

3. To run the keygen, copy the key.exe file into the same directory as the maps and then 

give the following command: ""test4 Western_Europe.mid"" in the Command prompt.

4. Copy the files contained in this torrent to the SD card in a directory that you can 

name as you want  I created the directory WesternEurope in the SD card root.

5. Once copied, just power on the TomTom with the SD card inside, then choose from the 

preferences ""map management/swap maps"". Western Europe should be there, selec that, it 

will ask for the Activation. Enter it with spaces just like in the keygen and you're done!"

,weeteebee,2008-06-07T17:54Z,"Hello, just did it on my HTC TyTN II
It took some work but it works right now.
Just to try to help others and save them the time i spend:

http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3686761/TT6_kg_All.z
Use this keygen.. follow the instructions.

IT TOOK ME A WHILE TO FIND THE DEVICE ID:
THIS IS IN THE PROGRAM TOMTOM 6 NAV. OPEN IT AND CLICK ON THE RIGHT UNDER RECEIVE PICTURE (How many bars you have for sattelites) Then you see a button with the version of TOMTOM you have: CLICK ON THIS AND YOU SEE INFO LIKE ""Language' UNDER THAT IS YOUR DEVICE ID, some like: ANAS6 X8WJ2

Then I didnt get it that you have to go to the Command prompt (start-programs-accessories-Command prompt) VERY IMPORTANT THAT YOU DO THAT

There you fill in the test4.exe ('space') ***card***.mid... you fill in the ID you found in TOMTOM, then you get 3 code... I needed the 2nd (Pocket)... fill this in (watch the text file for further instructions and more clear instructions :P)...

but just wanted to help with those 2 points:
- DEVICE ID IS NOT IN YOUR TEL, BUT IN TOMTOM (see above how to find it in the prog)
- USE COMMAND PROMPT FOR ""TEST4.exe Western_Europe.mid"" and you get your right code (for Palm, pocket and ONE)...

Hope i helped y'all...

,AlexWayne,2008-07-26T01:50Z,"I only wonder one thing. How old are thi maps. According to the info above this file was uploaded 2006-12-28. 

Is it correct to asume that the maps are older then 2006-12??? Or are the maps newer than that?"
,cri33,2008-08-14T12:27Z,TULWEED  it is working as like you told. Brilliant . I have copied the map into my TOMTOM & hi was asking to activate the map. I've done the job with test4 all and then i put the activation code. It is working without problems. Thank's for your advice.
,cri33,2008-08-14T12:34Z,"Tulweed it is necesarly to place a copy on the card. I've done it and it is working good. Also done it with a ONE without a slot for memory card. I've used the memory remained on the hard drive. On the memory card for the other device ,i've copied the map and a copy of the tomtom software. Otherwise is not working"

,VULTURILI,2012-06-24T12:01Z,"Very Important ! No one says here,

The map is working properly but you need to activate it and the process i sucks because if you have a TomTom One you can not enter spaces when you are asked the activation code. To resolve this issue you must connect the navigator to your pc, open TomTom Home Software and locate : Operate my Device button, there you can enter the key code with spaces ... because the activation code must be entered in TomTom One with SPACE S!
