Swear to god this is the best program i have ever used to convert any format to DVD. It does it perfectly!

So far i have:
xvid HD to dvd
divx to dvd
xvid to dvd
MP4 files to dvd
VCD to dvd
PAL dvd to NTSC DVD


All of them has come out perfectly too.

PAL to NTSC pulldowns are PERFECT!!! no jittery motion, totally smooth.
any other pulldown comes out perfect as well

It also burns dvd's within the program and this as worked extremely well, as well as automatically adding chapters every set interval."
