Sync was adjusted 105ms to correct. Left in .avi and not compressed to .rar for ease. Mpeg2  and actual DVD to follow. Enjoy"

,kaboom2009,2006-12-24T07:11Z,"Help please

I can hear the avi play, but I cannot see any video.
It takes a bit longer to load, I am playing it on regular windows media player, maybe I need Mpeg2? -I don't know what that is. 

Help please."

Don't use WMP, it's evil."

,bigkev000,2006-12-30T18:23Z,i tried burning this onto a dvdr but nero says its too big to fit on a dvd but only  dvd 9. i cant find these anywhere. so i tried breaking it into two parts and put half on one disc and the other on another disc and sat down to watch and saw that the audio was out of sync. how can i fix this?
,acandr,2007-01-01T15:03Z,"bigkev000, no need to burn to dvd it's 700 mb. I overburn 150mb on hp cd's using K3B (in Linux of course). Vid/Aud is in sync. Download a live cd distro like Linspire,Kanotix,Knoppix and use K3b it's way better and free.No install needed.Hope this helps. "
