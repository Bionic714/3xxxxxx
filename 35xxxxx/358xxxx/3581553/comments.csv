,jomax,2006-12-22T13:35Z,"Nån som vet?
Packar upp med WinRar och får ner en Winamp media fil. Så fort den kommer upp får jag ett felmeddelande ""explorer.exe har stött på ett problem och måste avslutas"", ""skicka, skicka inte"". Filmen går att se i datorn men pga felet går den inte att flytta till tex DVDSanta eller ConvertXtoDVD så att man kan göra om den till DVD och bränna. Detta har hänt med flera filmer jag laddat ner. Mycket tacksam om nån som kan vill förklara? GOD JUL alla ""pirater""!"
,biffaboy,2006-12-22T14:32Z,"Yeah, this is real and good quality.
Thanks for the upload, Rockhard."

,smithjohn57,2006-12-22T22:15Z,What the fuck is XViD.DVD?
,y222,2006-12-23T00:45Z,How is the quality?
,blue_tomato,2006-12-23T03:42Z,"Good quality. Kinda sad and melancolic movie though, not at all like the previous ones."
,Iceburgslim,2006-12-23T05:10Z,"Great quality.  Very pleased.  

The movie is a typical Rocky movie with better effects and better acting.  So if you didn't like the other movies, you won't like this one.

I wasn't a big fan of the older ones, but i think this is the best in the series by far."
,Vampire1979,2006-12-23T06:36Z,Unbelievable !! GOOD WORK 100% good video and sound .... THANX ALLOT an keep up the good work 
,pmsbull,2006-12-23T13:45Z,"FANTATSIC QUALITY POST OF THIS VERY GOOD MOVIE. Hats off to you Rockhard1, this is what we want to see, new movies in excellent quality in doublequick time. 10 / 10 matey.
Have you got any other posts out there with this quality ?"
,Latiino,2006-12-23T17:17Z,c'mon seed ffs!
,ticktock_man,2006-12-23T19:15Z,"this looks more like a VHS screener than a DVD  screener: anyone that says this is 'awesome quality' needs to get their eyes checked. 

either way, quality is not so terribly important since it is meant to be a grainy, dark, seedy-looking movie and not an effects-laden cinematic feast. 

so while i would rate the video a 6/10 - it is far better than any CAM or telesync, and the video and audio of this release is more than sufficient for this particular movie.   "
,Movie_Critic,2006-12-25T22:18Z,"Perfect! and in-sync!

Rockhard1 - you're ability will not be questioned ever again. "
,marcus_667,2006-12-27T19:32Z,oh great film loved it seeding  like a trooper now with my sucky 50 kb/s upload speed :(
