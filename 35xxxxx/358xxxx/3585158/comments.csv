,Macaque,2008-05-10T07:15Z,"This app doesn't work under Vista, FYI.
I initially thought it was a bad release but it worked fine in a VMWare session running XP on the same machine (naturally it's useless in VMWare). Under Vista the app will run but when you select any of the recovery tools it just crashes out.
Neat tool - wish I could use it :("
,pixogen,2008-05-11T21:12Z,"This app has saved my ass so many times. As Macaque has stated, it doesn't work under vista, but it works great on Windows XP and Windows Server 2003."
,Phara0h,2008-06-17T11:54Z,"Actually, I just tested this under Vista (right click and run as administrator) and it seems to work fine.."
