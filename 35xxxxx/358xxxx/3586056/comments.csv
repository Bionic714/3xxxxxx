,Flagcarrier,2008-04-22T20:07Z,"This is NOT a ROM, but an image of the mini-DVD. You can use this file in order to burn it and then play it on a chipped Wii or Gamecube. It will NOT work on any emulators."

,critters30,2011-05-03T20:40Z,"Works fine with latest Dolphin emulator. Cut scenes are slow, but the game it's self runs at 100% speed. I have several versions of Dolphin on my pc, as different versions play certain games better. This game would only work with r7501. Thanks for the upload, my daughter loves this game!"

This can be loaded in several ways.

1. PC - Dolphin emulator. Works fine.
2. Wii - both hard and soft modded.

For softmod wii, you can burn this to a disk, and load it with neogamma (get newest version)

You can run it from an sd card on wii using mios dios lite.

you can now run it from usb on wii using mios dios 2 - http://www.wiihacks.com/homebrew/103429-dios-mios-v2-0-a-4.html"
