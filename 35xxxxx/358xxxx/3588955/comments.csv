,Wav3 CrackeR,2007-01-03T18:39Z,"Woohoo! This one really works! I`m using ..

1. Run Setup.exe (That will install diskeeper)
2. Don`t run diskeeper! (After installation)
3. Run Crack (Wait)
4. When u start diskeeper the first time click ""Remind me later"" (Never) when the registation window appears!

Good Luck N Happy New Year!"
,ALIEN68,2007-01-03T19:54Z,"This isn't a proper crack.After instalation and runing the crack its anyway days are counting down from 30.After instalation its anyway a 30 day trial version.What this ""crack"" does its simply after everytime you run it, it resets days back to 30.Maybe someone finaly will crack this program properly. Are you crazy? Why you upload with the same so called ""crack"" which is not function.Exactly the same crack like this one http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3586741/Crack_for_Diskeeper_2007_Pro_Premier_by_AHTeam.You just took and reuploaded the same thing only one difference that you icnluded diskeeper iinstaller.What's use?How you can say that its function 100% if its not!!!!!"

,k9182000,2007-01-03T21:10Z,"what you mean doesn't work ALIEN68

I have install it and changed the clock ahead 6 year still not activation? I have tried this with the license  hack and it will ask you to active. So if you don't call that crack well I don't know. (Cracking a program means removing the nag screens a limitations) Now I think we have done that. "
,gedent,2007-01-05T19:15Z,"George: Ihave tried it now for some days and it is all working. No problems about the automatic defrag and no questins about activating.Nor is there any counting down messages. Also search it with Ashampoo antispyware, Windows defender,Ad aware and of course Mc Affe internet securitu, but no bad results, so this is okey"
,ALIEN68,2007-01-06T02:56Z,You are not getting meseges about activating or day counting.Go in in menu activate diskeeper or enter licence key and you will see.

,Wav3 CrackeR,2007-01-09T11:32Z,ALIEN68 it sounds to me that you search for problems on this program/torrent! I have used this program from this torrent when it first become uploaded by k9182000 and it have been working since that day.So i think you should stop complaining. You can use the program right?
,crippa999,2007-01-10T15:54Z,This one actually works. Thx dude for this upload!
,NWE,2007-01-15T21:03Z,"About the lame Virus/Trojan/Porn spam comment-terror:

Come on they're trying to confuse us by telling there are viruses and telling us that there are NO viruses in the comments. Who cares? Download and see for yourself if your antivirus reports!

BSA/MPAA/RIAA/whoever (spammer) tactic:
> Upload appz with virus
> Spam TPB appz comments with ""virus warnings"" and fake statements, to confuse people.
> Sink PirateBay(!)

Will it succeed? Hmm... At least I download and my antivirus checks, as usual. It is rather pathetic after all.."
,Uncle_Ian,2007-01-25T23:57Z,"I have yet to install the program and run the crack, but I can at least confirm that the crack file, ""crack_aht.exe"" does not contain any viruses according to http://virusscan.jotti.org/  That site allows uploads of files less than 15MB, and scans them with 15 different AV scanners.  The setup.exe file is to large to upload to that site, but my own scan with AVG detected no viruses with definitions current as of January 25, 2007.  I'll report back as to whether the crack works for me or not."
,jorgen213,2007-02-20T18:50Z,Thanks! :-P
,barrettg,2007-03-11T16:33Z,"For all those trying to get it working download this Zip file [http://www.eggdisk.com/files/290923_lj2xk/License.zip] and extract the 2 files to your diskeeper installation folder then run the ""crack_aht.exe"" and it should work fine."
,Uncle_Ian,2007-04-02T00:34Z,"A followup to my previous post regarding this torrent: Over two months after installing this file,  ""Diskeeper Corporation 2007 Pro Premier 100% Working,"" it is STILL working just fine!!!  No nags, no limitations, no problems with it at all.  Oh yeah, and NO viruses, either."
,niovis,2007-04-11T22:56Z,"The crack DOES work.

If it doesn't work for you, it's probably because you installed diskeeper somewhere besides the default installation directory. What you can do is:

1)Run the Crack. The crack will create files in the default install Directory (C:\Program Files\Diskeeper Corporation\Diskeeper)

2)Crl+Alt+Del and end DkService.exe

3)Cut/Copy the files that the crack created.

4)Paste the files into the install directory wherever you installed it.

5)Enjoy!

Note: Diskeeper might not run without the DkService.exe. If so, restart your computer and you should be good to go."
