,blwilli,2006-12-29T13:00Z,"Nero Showtime, Nero Vision, and Nero Wave Editor are all available in nero 6.6 Ultra, yet it takes up half the space.  That is beside the point, as I have watched three people download this, yet only one has stuck around to seed.  I'm done."
,blwilli,2007-01-04T01:19Z,"I did seed until a couple (exact meaning of couple...two) other people reached 100%.  appearently they bailed when they were done, so my asking me to reseed until a couple reach 100%, you actually mean until 4 reach 100%.  What do I do when THEY bail too.  Am I expected to be the sole seed for this torrent from now until eternity?  Why must I bear the burden for other people's lack of courtesy?  I'm on Azereus, so people who aren't even on the tracker can download from me (that's why the Pirate Bay only shows it downloaded once).  I will seed until two, AND ONLY TWO more have 100%.  Then I'm done.  Period.  I will not reseed again, so do not ask."
,olav66,2007-01-04T14:57Z,"Thanks to the uploader and for him expressing we should stay on. I'm used to do that over at DimeADozen and happy to see it finally happening here too.
It's actually easily done, to stay on after completing a torrent.
Simply create another folder and copy the contents of the download folder into it. Then you can continue seeding and still burn from the another folder.
Please do! We're not here only for ourselves, we're here for other peers too. It's a pity PB doesn't have a share ratio system. If that was implemented everyone would benefit...

Thanks blwilli... for your upload :-)"
,blwilli,2007-01-08T02:22Z,and thank you olav66 for your support.  I agree..I like dime's enforcement policy
,lutefisk,2007-01-30T14:36Z,It says i need to remove windows to do this but when i looked how theres like three ways to do it how should i remove windows so i can install this?
,lutefisk,2007-01-30T14:52Z,Would i open command prompt and put format c: /s then pop in the winborg cd and restart?
,tomreedtoon,2007-02-06T12:30Z,"Kind of surprising. It took three disk copies to get it to begin to load; I guess some sectors on the disks were flaky (although I haven't had trouble with anything else). Then, it asked me for the reg code. I thought that was supposed to be filled in automatically!"
,blwilli,2007-02-08T15:30Z,"It asks for a registration code if you ""upgrade""...you're supposed to format your drive and do a clean install."
,LOKI_LOKI,2007-04-19T05:31Z,"How does this version differ from the Windows XP Borg Edition V5.0 Final found at

http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3425819/Windows_XP_Borg_Edition_V5.0_Final

I downloaded that one months ago and have a share ratio of 7 on it.

Have there been changes to the actual installation of XP or has the list of programs changed which are available to install after the initial installation is complete."
,tabasca,2007-06-14T17:10Z,"When i download this i get a zip file, but when i exztract it, i dont get the iso file, i get a whole bunch of programs! how do i do this? burn ever of these files to a dvd and just put it in??"
,blwilli,2007-07-06T17:49Z,"I don't know that there's any difference, except that a friend of mine needed it, there were no seeds at the time, so I just made a torrent so he could download it, and then stayed on a while to seed after that."
,FlankerB,2008-01-30T16:58Z,"quote: ""...Nero Showtime is much better than PowerDVD.."" 

What are you talking about, steelynx?
Nero ShowTime is definitely worse than PowerDVD 7 or WinDVD 8. ShowTime (from Nero 7) has the same picture quality as PowerDVD 6, but it doesn't read subtitles correctly. It displays only the first subtitle track of a DVD, that isn't good if you are trying to watch a DVD with 2 or more subtitles.
PowerDVD 7.2 and 7.3 works great without AVIVO, while version 7.1 (first with Vista support) is better with AVIVO."
