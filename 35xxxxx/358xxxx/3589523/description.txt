Biography:
With the experimental warmth of '60s French films and the pizzicato flavor of 
horizontal hip-hop, Simon Green's Bonobo project established a welcome niche of 
a pretension-free, post-party intellectual chill-out. An almost silent figure 
among Ibizian romanticists, Green began in Brighton, debuting in 1999 with a 
track on Tru Thoughts Recordings' When Shapes Join Together compilation. Though 
tempted by offers from Mute and XL after the official issue of "The Scuba EP" 
and the "Terrapin" single, Green stuck with Tru Thoughts for the acclaimed debut 
LP Animal Magic. Highlighted by downtempo dub, funk, and an equally likable use 
of sitars, Animal Magic was an obvious success and plans were quickly made for 
careful European support appearances, as well as a follow-up album, Dial "M" for 
 Monkey, for Coldcut's Ninja Tune label. A tour to support the record followed 
and was documented on the 2005 EP Live Sessions.

Kiba Informs:
This is the latest album from Bonobo. If you want the other albums you may 
download them here: http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3528562/Bonobo_-_Discography
I have tried to get this album for months, and I finnally found it on eMule. There are two versions of this album; one with 18 tracks, and one with 11 (this one). I actually bought this CD, but CDON needed more than a month to get it. It supposed to be in my mailbox soon. So if its the 18 track version i bought, I will put it out on the Pirat Bay.
