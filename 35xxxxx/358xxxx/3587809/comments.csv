The connections there maybe isn't that fast, or pherhaps starting 12 upploads at the same time wasn't a good idea after all :-). But at least he is trying and I'm thankful for every kb. I've airbrushed a Triumph Bonneville -53 once, it did not look good at all. Much harder than it looks."

,oleanhardrock21,2008-01-12T16:51Z,"In my opinion this video sucks.  Basically one long advertisement for skullmaster stencils.  
Here's some advice guys.  Go to office depot or ebay and get some transparency film for overhead projectors (thin clear plastic stuff).  Bring it to your library, computer screen, print outs, anything flat, and trace over it with a thin sharpie.  Cut it out carefully with a sharp exacto and theres your skulls, fire, chipminks, cat poop, whatever.  

On a side note, everyone should remember to thank those who go out of there way to helping us out!  You should also throw in a couple of personal comments on the video so we can get an idea of what it is before we DL.

Bunje, thanks for your great contributions man!  I for one really appreciate them!"
