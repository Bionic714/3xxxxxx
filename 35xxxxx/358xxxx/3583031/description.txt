Description
...........


This program focuses on the high-profile conflicts and rivalries emerging between hip-hop artists. 

These battles might be called cat fights if their participants didn't put so much stress on machismo; the back-and-forth insult contests can lead to impressive wordplay and entertainment--but also, sometimes, to violence. 

The "beefs" between 50 Cent and The Game, Lil' Flip and TI, and Nelly and Chingy are just a few of those examined here.
