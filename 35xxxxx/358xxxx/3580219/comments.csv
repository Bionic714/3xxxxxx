People, these guys are WONDERFUL!
Every year they hold a music festival, and then donate the money to a worthy cause.  

Make sure to visit them on the web (www.wookiefoot.com); if you want to help make a difference, please, donate to their charities, or buy one of many CD's 

(I personally suggest buying ""Domesticated"" and ""ACTIVATE"" for your first two).

Stay funky bliss-junkies!
