World of Warcraft Patch from 2.0.0 to 2.0.3 


This is the European Patch 



I don\'t have a fast internet connection (20kbs upload) so please seed this as well for others to get as the blizzard downloader sucks and is too slow...I was getting 3kbps with that....just hope my connect is quicker 


Folder Structure (assuming your WoW is on drive C):


C:\\Program Files\\World of Warcraft\\Patches\\WoW-2.0.0-to-2.0.3-enGB-Win-patch\\


Place the extracted file in that folder (wow-partial-1.MPQ)....in fact if you run the blizzard patcher once it should create this structure then just over write with the bigger file if you prefer.


Also the first time I\'ve done a torrent hopefully it works fine.
