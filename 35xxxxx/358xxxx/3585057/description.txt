Synopsis:In this funny French entry in the "Gendarme" series of films, bungling inspector Cruchot (played by Jerry Lewis-like French comedian De Funes) finds himself trying to save the residents of St. Tropez from oil-guzzling humanoid space aliens. But for their constant thirst for petro-products, the only other way to tell the invaders from people is touch them and see if they sound like empty garbage cans. Soon chaos reigns. ~ Sandra Brennan, All Movie Guide
