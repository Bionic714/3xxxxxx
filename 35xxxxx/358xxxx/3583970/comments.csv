Cold someone please help me?"

,variscora,2007-03-11T02:14Z,"This file is unusable...cannot be opened with any player, including VLC."
,variscora,2007-03-11T02:32Z,"Attempting to play this file with any media player triggers a message...""file name invalid."" This file is not recommended...long to download with nothing to show for it."
,madscape,2007-03-11T09:31Z,"playback problems are caused by the number of letters in the title. Shorten the name, and it wil play"
,variscora,2007-03-11T14:03Z,"Thought of that...file does not allow renaming, or copying and pasting, or anything else."
,variscora,2007-03-11T14:18Z,Seeder arttorrents needs to rename this file to something more usable...files that do not play do not get re-seeded.
,madscape,2007-03-11T21:31Z,"try changing the folders name, or redirect your finished downloads to a folder in c:

Its a great film!"
,gubbins4ever,2007-03-23T08:00Z,"I figured out how to get this file working, despite not being initially able to change the filename. Here's how I did it:

Delete the folder with the file in it. Then go into your Recycle bin and Restore the folder and file. Now you are able to rename both folder and file: do so and rename both with much shorter filenames."
,sourman,2007-07-23T05:39Z,"It doesn't work. Its Windows that cannot read the file not the media player. The file name is invalid on an english version of Windows because it uses characters that are not standard (east-european I figure). 

Look at the title of the torrent at the top of the page, it reads ""?i?ek"". Do you get it ? Not even the web server can display them properly.

I try deleting and restoring, no go. If you have a client where you can change the file name before downloading, you're in business, if jot, you're screw...

Someone knows of a software that can rename files even if Windows can't read the name ?"
,sourman,2007-07-26T04:37Z,"Oupse. My mistake...

IT does WORK, you only need to shorten the folder name.

Seems the path is include in the name of the file and the buffer can't hold that many characters."
,blrock69,2007-09-28T17:58Z,Yes that works fine! thanks
,videoclub2000,2007-11-18T18:29Z,"Repackaged this torrent here...

Removed non roman characters from title, and corrected aspect ratio, at least on my Mac. It is a mov file now but the encoding inside is identical mpeg-4. It was not re-compressed.

,Johnny_Meagher,2008-03-16T15:54Z,"I had problems with this one also. I downloaded Quicktime (which I didn't want to do) but it only played the sound. I opened with Media Player and it only played the video! (when it says ""may be able to play it"" just click ok)  So with the two going (and a bit of manual lip syncing I got it playing. :) Thanks"
,Johnny_Meagher,2008-03-17T01:08Z,"further comment

quality and sound very good

had trouble opening this one for a while, had to play the sound in one player & the video in another but it works just fine in VLC - looking forward to starting to watch this 2.5 hour film at midnight! check out Zizek! also, very funny in parts"
