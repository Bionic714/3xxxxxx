ask any troop that comes back from iraq.. they will be shocked when they turn on and all they show is the death in iraq. 


they never show the positives. 


terrorism kills roughly 300?

if yoiu dont know the economy is BOOMING in iraq.. everything is up. the people in iraq been killing eachother for years hundreds of years. its there religion. why dont you research a little before you start posting your liberal crap and a view that noone wants to hear. another thing. u say they kill roughly 300. what about our troops that died? they werent killed by terrorists tho right? got another movie to defend that statement?
