I was going to launch the new version, but i cant find the soundtrack; perhaps when I finally get home..."

info:
this is a high-bitrate Divx rip, intended to provide decent compression with minimal degradation. video resolution is 1024x576 , in order to preserve detail by not shrinking the vertical axis. audio tracks are the original ac3 /5.1 versions. 

requirements:
-hw : 1.3 Ghz CPU, 64 MB graphics card, 5.1 speakers highly reccomended
-sw: Divx 5 or better , Ac3 codec, Haali media splitter, Morgan stream switcher, FFD-Show; or any player that can manage these by itself, such as VLC or Media Player Classic.

Enjoy ! ;-)"
