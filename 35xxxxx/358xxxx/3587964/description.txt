In a similar tone to her first full-length release, Hot Cup Of Talk, Kathy Griffin returns to the stage in another rampant release of rage. Dishing on everyone from Pam Anderson to Debbie Gibson to Hilary Swank she leaves no stone unturned and no celebrity reputation undamaged. This is one DVD Hollywood doesn't want you to see.
