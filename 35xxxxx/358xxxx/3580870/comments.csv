,bahamutnyne,2008-03-07T05:40Z,@indianacolts...look at the info it says audio:japanese and subtitles: enrish the other 1 is engrish/engrish theyres only so many episodes in engrish cuz its still getting translated i would prefer watching all the episodes in engrish but i dont wanna wait til they all get translated so im watching the japs wit eng subs and its not that bad u just gotta adjust how u watch them and its a good idea 2 not eat while ur watching cuz itll be easy 2 miss something gr8 seireies so far i thought it was just a kids cartoon when it started on cartoon network like yugayhoooo but its actually good its no yu yu hakusho but its mad long and the shippuden saga is suppose 2 be good as well so 250+ ep is good
