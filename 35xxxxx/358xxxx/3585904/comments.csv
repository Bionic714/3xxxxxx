[V],felch,2007-01-04T01:07Z,I think using devhook will do the trick - devhook seems to make whatever firmware version you have less of an issue... drop a message to let us know how you got on
,DeadlyBro,2007-01-06T04:26Z,no because u gotta downgrade ur psp to fw1.5 or lower and i dnt want to because im afriad to screw uup my psp.

If you have custom FW 3.xx you put it in the (memcard)/ISO
If you use 1.50 you need a ISO loader"
