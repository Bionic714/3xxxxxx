Here you go, Brainiac - s04.
Contains all eps that are listed at www.tv.com
I downloaded these eps from TPB one by one, so this torrent is just all those combined in one place. The eps have good quality.

Here's my previous Brainiac upload, with s01 + s02 + s03

If you like Brainiac then you'll like MythBusters. You can dl MythBusters here:

Observe:
I don't want messeges concerning subs, there aren't any in this torrent and I DON'T
know where to get them, so just learn english!
Don't msg me about "i can't play the files...", download VLC! (www.videolan.org)
Seed atleast 1:1
And don't msg me about seeding if your dl averages around 20 KB/s

if you have any other questions you are welcome to msg me @TPB :)



Sidenotes:
Have in mind that not all you see on Brainiac is a 100% real.
Many things are filmtricks. Like htf can vinegar mixed with baking soda result in such a violent reaction that it blows apart a microwave and bends the shell metal?? I say it's fake - they put an explosive of some sort in there to make it look better on TV, which is cheap. Apart from the fake stuff and the totally rediculous/unscientific experiments this is a pretty entertaining show.
