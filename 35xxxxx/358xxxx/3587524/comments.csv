,Straticus,2007-01-01T15:18Z,"I seem to be seeding it through Azureus, but I'm not quite sure how to seed it HERE on Pirate Bay...someone want to tell me so I can get it done? I'm really anxious for you guys to see this flick...If I'm not doing something, you HAVE to tell me otherwise I won't know how to fix it :)

,Straticus,2007-01-02T07:28Z,"fuck...I added the pirate bay tracker announce addy into Azureus...there are a bunch of people downloading from me, but nobody from here, it seems...will someone PLEASE tell me how to make sure you all get this? Again, this is my first torrent and upload, and all I need to know is the process ONE time, so that when I create and upload new torrents, I won't have to ask these retarded questions again :)...And by the way, please don't respond to me in Swedish :) I have NO clue what you're saying....

Peace

,Straticus,2007-01-03T05:33Z,"I don't get it...whenever someone needs to bitch and complain about something, these comment lines are FILLED with bullshit...I'm wanting to contribute, I'm having a bit of difficulty, and nobody's commenting on how I can get it done? Come ON you frequent torrent makers! Give me the info I need please :) And only in English or French please...I don't understand Swedish at all (unfortunately)

,Aga1980,2007-01-05T10:33Z,"Dear Straticus,

It's not the complete DVD. Only the vob files and one ifo. We need all the files on your original dvd.

Please correct this...

Thanks for your efforts."
,Straticus,2007-01-05T15:35Z,"alright, I will redo it :/....this was the information I had gotten, and did what I was told...in the future, I'll snag all the files...are you saying that the movie doesn't work in the current state it's in?

S O'C"
,Aga1980,2007-01-05T20:50Z,"Yup, won't work...
I am sorry for you. 

Maybe you could do a separate torrent for the missing files only?"
,made-of-technetium,2007-01-08T17:35Z,I couldn't burn to DVD because of the missing files so instead I converted it to DivX (my preffered format anyway) with DrDivX & It plays fine now
