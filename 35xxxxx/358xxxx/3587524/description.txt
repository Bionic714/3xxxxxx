Well, I think I finally got the process correct for this world premiere release of Liquid Sky! This is my first torrent, so if it does't work properly, let me know and I will do whatever it takes to fix it, and make sure it's right and everyone can enjoy it.

This is a very strange and wonderful cult film from the Punk, New Wave era about aliens who come to earth searching for heroin. They find that the chemical produced in the brain during orgasm is very similar to the effects of heroin, and I'll let you all watch it without spoiling the story.

For those of you who love the bizarre, you will not be disappointed. This is a MUST-SEE. I ripped it directly from the DvD, so the quality is top notch.

I hope you all enjoy this very hard to find cult classic!
