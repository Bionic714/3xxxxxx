,james_mel,2007-01-07T12:47Z,"Hi great video - are you still seeding? Torrent says stuck at 48%, but may be building.  Also at Mininova you have posted it under the music video category, so may be hard to find on there.  This is an excellent training programme.  Thanks for uploading!"
,james_mel,2007-01-07T12:50Z,"Do you have the others as well - breastroke, etc?  Will deftinitely help seeding.  Thanks!"
,castufari,2007-01-09T02:28Z,"I was stuck at 48.1% too, someone is seeding it and I should have it tonight. Will let this gem sit at 100% until it's no longer wanted!"
,rh128592,2007-02-09T16:35Z,"I'm seeding this off an old 700mhz computer that locks up every few days.  If I don't catch it then the seed will go down.

More importantly, lots of people are downloading this and no one seeds it for very long.  Given how limited the interest is in this video (relative to 24 or Lost) anyone who downloads it needs to seed it for longer than they would The Daily Show.

I'm afraid I don't have any of the DVDs.  I got this from the library and saw the other torrent were huge.  I do suggest getting the book.  It fleshes out the underlying ideology.

Hope everyone is swimming faster and easier.  I'm still working on floating better.

Cheers,
Brian

PS: SEED THIS!!!"

Thanks for the idea.  I did just that but (unfortunately) didn't get a speed boost.

I'm not running a firewall or antivirus on my torrent box.  I forwarded both TCP and UDP.  My global upload and per-torrent upload rate is set to max.  I'm using Azureus.

Cheers,

,momist,2007-06-02T00:39Z,"Come on - if you really support the concept of Total Immersion, seed this for at least 500%!

Everyone should be able to swim well and confidently.  Please help others and seed this for as long as you can."
,rh128592,2007-06-04T20:27Z,"I'd had a ton of problems with my ISP.  If I upload 20k I essentially shut down all my downstream traffic.  That, coupled with server problems, wrecked my seeding.

But yes, you're right.  Ideally I would still be seeding it."
,rh128592,2008-03-04T03:04Z,"I'm glad to see this torrent still going strong.  When the USA kicks Australia's ass in swimming at Beijing, I'm taking most the credit.

Happy laps,
Mook & Bee"
,boonp,2008-04-07T11:56Z,"NO one seems to seed it at the moment. Please help seeding it.  I am seeding many others. If seeder need any others. If I have it, I 'll seed it right away."
,MrMansson,2008-05-10T16:26Z,"Any chance of getting hold of this in proper quality?

Thank you!"
,Mariachy,2008-05-30T21:33Z,"THX a lot I almost buy the DVD today thx so much for all who seed this DVD, Im going to look for the another ones "
,rh128592,2008-07-24T04:24Z,"It was one of my first tries.  So yeah, it's fucked up.  Check your local library--they might have it."
,redhare,2009-02-28T18:08Z,"Just uploaded it, ripped from original DVD.

Complete DVD image coming."
,Maoxx,2009-03-03T21:45Z,Hey Mook & Bee.. That's a pretty prophetic statement you made above. I think you truly deserve to bask in the glory!
