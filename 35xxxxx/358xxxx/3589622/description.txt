FLYLOGIC's "Airport GENEVA 2004" - Repack By 108

This is some sort of CD-ROM Rip I guess - The original torrent is gone from tpb, so no record of who up'd it in the first place.

Included is the file: Geneva_Patch_CHPRO.zip
This is a compatibility fix for using Geneva 2004 with Switzerland Pro. Pretty self explanatory there.

Not much there to read though, so I suggest U just install the damn thing and enjoy. :-)
