,empty.handed,2006-12-27T00:25Z,What's R5? Region 5?
,Qrystjof,2006-12-27T12:05Z,"Over the past 6 months the major movie studios have been releasing retail 
dvds early in Russia.  They do this to stop the widespread use of pirated 
telecines (which were once very common).  Lately however there has been very
few real telecines, most of the scene telecines you see are actually R5 
retails.  
R5 retail is rushed out by the studio, they are basically competing with 
pirates, so there is little to no cleanup of the film after the telecine 
process.  So the main difference between telecines put out by the pirates 
is that the r5's are done using pro equipment, professional studios and 
professional people.  The quality of R5 retail is very similar to dvdscr's, 
no time is usually spent cleaning up dvdscrs either.
The range of  quality we now have is like this.
R1/2 retail > DVDSCR > R5 Retail > Telecine > Telesync > Cam.  Vhs scr and 
wps, come around the ts mark (obviously differs between rls).
We will be tagging future releases as follows:
Tag: R5   Example:  Moviename.R5.format-group
Description: Any R5 retail with english audio will be tagged as this.  
In the past R5 with english audio has been wrong tagged as, TC
(ex: The.Departed.PROPER.READ.NFO.TC.XviD-ZN), DVDSCR 
(ex: Trust.The.Man.LiMiTED.DVDSCR.DVDR-BOOM) and DVDRip 
(ex: The.Matador.2005.DVDRiP.XviD-HLS).  
We want to cut this bullshit, and just tag as R5, not as dvdrip, just 
a new category:  R5.
Tag: R5.LINE   Example: Moviename.R5.LINE.format-group
Any R5 retail, which hasn't got english audio will be synced to DIRECT LINE
english audio and tagged as R5.LINE.  In the past these have been tagged 
as TC (ex: Crank.TC.XviD-ZN) and DVDSCR
(ex: Ice.Age.2.The.Meltdown.DVDSCR.XViD-DaNK).
Tag: TC  Example Moviename.TC.format-group
Any illegally produced non studio telecine, should be tagged TC.  
Basically we are sick of whats happening, somebody has to make a stand, 
just look at the whole pirates of the caribbean mess!

,djapstar,2007-01-07T22:24Z,Jag har också svårt (eller omöjligt) att få 5.1-ljud. Den leverar bara två kanaler.. Hur kommer detta sig när det står 5.1 i releasen?
