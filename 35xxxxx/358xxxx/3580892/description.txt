Based on Jeff Lindsay's novel "Darkly Dreaming Dexter," this crime thriller follows Dexter Morgan. Dexter is a successful forensics blood spatter expert, but lurking just beneath his charismatic personality is a terrible truth. Dexter has corralled his innate homicidal urges into a closely guarded second career: He hunts down and brutally murders those vicious criminals who have managed to avoid the clutches of the law.
