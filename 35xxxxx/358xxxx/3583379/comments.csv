This is working. It's the wrong movie size according to the webpage, but i tried them all and this worked when i renamed it to ""moviename"".srt"

Thank you! I've been having problems with every srt file I've downloaded for this movie.... finally I get to watch it!"
,nlwient2,2009-01-24T16:31Z,The videoquality of this torrent is not really good.. Especially movements of people are somewhat 'fading'
,qkn13,2009-03-28T00:43Z,thanks for sub info hope the rip is good:)
,regsucks,2009-04-02T04:59Z,Is this the full movie? It seems to start mid scene?
