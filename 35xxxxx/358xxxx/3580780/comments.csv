,Palle-Pirat,2006-12-22T10:06Z,"Hi there.
Using the correct catagorys makes it much simpler to find the download You've searched for.
Selecting the DVD-R section means that this is ONLY for DVD-R's. Either as VIDEO_TS folders or as .bin or .iso.
Please make it easy for all of us and respect the catagorys.
