I am up loading at 500kb and I?m getting 15kb back."
,blackinkgeorge,2008-11-17T07:17Z,"Thanks BhangWalla, nice rip. This movie pissed me off, in a good way.

BTW: if anyone wants to actually down load this I am up loading at 1mb so increase your down load rates and take more than 40k at a time. I would feel a lot better if I could get my ratio to 1:3 at least, but I?m not gonna seed forever."
