,T2G,2007-05-21T16:51Z,"This coming from someone who's never bothered to upload anything!

I'm well aware this is available free for download. 

But there has been 11,705 downloads of this torrent so far from tpb alone. Let alone the fact that six months on from when I first uploaded it there are still 50 seeders.

It seems that all these people either preferred to download it here or didn't know where else to get it.

So, to answer your question that's why I uploaded it.

Maybe you should contribute something yourself before bitching at some else for providing stuff for leeches like you."
