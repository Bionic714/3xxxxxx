,skoobydubie,2007-01-03T23:54Z,how many episodes are in this one? I saw six from an earlier dl. i always up 1.5 times my down. torrents are fed by us all so be nice and replace what you take. that's rule number one.
,MethodLoser,2007-01-04T02:54Z,"There are 8 episodes, 4 per disk I believe."
,MethodLoser,2007-01-11T08:32Z,"Okay I'm off this one, on to making another torrent. I'm relying upon you people to seed for me, now, please don't let this die :("
,MethodLoser,2007-01-11T09:16Z,"I'm moving to Story of a Junkie, by the way.

Here's a list of all my DVDs, make requests if you want- http://bradp.co.uk/fredryk/dvds/"
,djstallion,2007-01-16T06:46Z,"Please seed! There is no seeders anymore! MethodLoser, You're seeding 9 gigs only one week...??? :("
,tjimpen,2008-03-12T16:58Z,please reseed this....
,jeffknight,2008-10-04T03:29Z,please seed!
,jeffknight,2008-10-04T18:35Z,"come on guys, stuck at 97%. Only an hour or so and I'll be at 100..."
,robin.mg,2008-10-05T16:35Z,"Is there a chance someone could seed? Just for a little while, everyone is stuck at 97.1 %
MethodLoser? Would be really nice!"
,Eriiik,2008-10-07T20:01Z,"plz plz plz seed

also stuck at 97,1%

pretty plz"
,robin.mg,2008-10-08T20:49Z,"hmm, i strangely saw 2 seeds yesterday, for about one hour. 
however, the peers stayed the same, and the seeds did not want to connect.

once again, PLEASE SEED!"
,paddlebitch,2008-10-14T19:47Z,"97,1% is the max, just rip the files as an iso and watch with VLC, it's fine

If you use a torrent program that add an extension to the files' names, remove it before buring the DVDs.

Cheers and thanks to the uploader"
,paddlebitch,2008-10-14T21:38Z,"correction, it doesn't work when you watch 'em...
lame"
,irPuMa,2008-10-27T11:20Z,did anyone end up getting this? would love dvdrip quality!
,irPuMa,2008-11-09T00:18Z,"holding strong at 97.1%

SOMEONE PLEASE RESEED THIS FILE.. i fully plan on seeding it for some time as soon as it finishes up.. so, someone out there.."
,MeesterDaveed,2009-05-28T02:52Z,"http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4917157/That_s_My_Bush__DVDrips_and_Commentaries

i did a dvdrip and the commentaries, so it's basically everything you'd get with the dvdrs...if people still feel a need for dvdrs, request them in a comment on my torrent, but first download it, thanks!
"
,msguy9875,2009-06-22T22:52Z,"After 2 years of nobody seeding this, I went ahead and bought the DVD set. (Hell, it was only $4.)

I replaced the incomplete files with the ones from the DVD's, so now I've got this torrent completed, and I'll seed it for a while so y'all can get it. I'm glad I didn't have to create a new torrent - it would have really sucked for everyone stuck at 97% to have to start over!"
,casaddams,2009-06-23T14:43Z,OMG! So there is a chance I will get this after all! Thanks buddy! (I'm not your buddy guy... I'm not your guy friend!... I'm not...) ; )
,casaddams,2009-06-23T14:45Z,Someone could make nice scans of box and cover... or is that pushing it?  : )

,casaddams,2009-06-26T04:13Z,Wow! That was prompt! Thanks alot!
,msguy9875,2009-06-26T07:13Z,"No problem... Oh btw, especially considering how long we've all been waiting for this, it'd be great if y'all could help me seed it when you finish downloading. Sharing is caring!"
,msguy9875,2009-08-05T20:28Z,"I'm abandoning this one - I fear for the future of Pirate Bay, so I've posted this collection on Demonoid. I can't post the link here due to the spam filter, so just go to Demonoid and search ""That's My Bush! The Definitive Collection"" (without the quotation marks), and it'll be the only result.

I've added cover screenshots and an nfo file to the new torrent, but I left the rest of the file structure intact, so if you started downloading it from this torrent, you should be able to continue from where you left off."
,dolamic,2010-01-01T08:05Z,MMFWCL Juggalos! You all keepin it real in the new motherfuckin' decade. Long live TPB and all s33d3rz!
