,Puttethebad,2006-12-24T09:27Z,CouldnÂ´t some of you guys stop downloading this so that a few can get it down and help with the seeding! I want to watch the final on this side of new years... 
,Puttethebad,2006-12-24T20:12Z,FFS stop downloading this torrent! You wont get more than about 5% anyway. PLAVI290... set your uploads to maximum 2-3 and a few of us will get a chance to help you seed eventually... This is gonna take us three weeks if you stupid fucks keep this shit up...
