It seems to be impossible to find a good rip of this CD.
I wish somebody would upload it in FLAC or even RAW/WAV-format.
Or maybe the master CD never went by someone with good ears.."

They made this music in a hurry. So distortion made it into the final, so to hear this music in mp3 is not good at all. You should find a RAw concert or Flac. Even though does the original CD have som disortion too, but less noticable than in Mp3."
