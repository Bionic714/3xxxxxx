So, I'm back with round 2 of the Moving Shadow Tribute Mix. I was going to do 3 parts however I've decided to condense the mix series down to 2 mixes with the first part focusing on the early years up to the 100th release while the second mix focused on everything else. Once again it was VERY hard to make a great mix due to the rediculous amount of quality quality tunes that are available through Moving Shadow's back catalog but I believe I've been able to pull it off nicely. I've also gone and "upgraded" the mix itself. If you have an iPod, where you would normally see the lyrics (press the center button 1-3 times) I've included the tracklist itself so that you'll be able to identify any of the songs you don't recognize or forget the name of...on the go :bgrin: plus full ID3 done this time. Anyway, on to the tracklist:
