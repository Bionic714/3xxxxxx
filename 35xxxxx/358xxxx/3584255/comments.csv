In the 1980s, radio station KABC carried the ground-breaking radio program ""OPEN MIND"" with host Bill Jenkins.   The subject matter covered included UFOs, alternative energy, spirituality, ancient religions, and more.   Bill Jenkins later went on to host the classic film ""THE NAKED TRUTH"" with Jordan Maxwell, upon which the current internet hit ""ZEITGEIST"" is based.

The ""Open Mind"" radio programs have not been heard in many years ... until now.   We recently came into possession of a large collection of cassette tape recordings which had been made by a loyal listener, and had them digitized into MP3s.  This is a priceless collection of otherwise unattainable radio programs.   It is being freely shared here in an effort to make sure it is not lost to  history.

[T],AhsokaTano,2008-11-09T00:30Z,I already have all 26 episodes of this UFO TV series already which are DVDRip to XviD and are High Quality 688x512 resolution at 700mb per episode. Its a good show but maybe a little outdated for you younger people out there but not for us older Sci-Fi fans out there. I also have all the 43 episodes of the 1960's Sci-Fi TV show called The Invaders from DVDRip to XviD and I also have all the DVDRip to XviD episodes of a TV show called Space 1999 as well which is 48 episodes all together; as well as all 78 original + the 2 pilot Episodes of the original Star Trek and the Star Trek animated series as well which was 22 episodes. I also have all 43 episodes of the Original Land of the Lost Tv series as well from DVDRip to XviD. I also have all 24 episodes of the original Battlestar Galactica and all 13 episodes of Battlestar galactica 1980 as well which are also DVDRip to XviD. Do you have any of the above shows I named IF you do then speak up below otherwise go back to the drawing board when it comes to having Sci-Fi Tv series like I have here.
