With the .r00 files there are .bin files and .cue files but I could not get them to work with daemon or winrar.  Any advice, suggestions, or instructions?  Does one need to load them to a disk first?  If so, how?  "

,Magpie13,2009-09-08T18:27Z,"@ juniorx72

use something like PowerISO or similar to manage your bin files - they're a bit like an ISO, only split into smaller files perfect for downloaders...use PowerISO or similar to mount the bin and you'll be fine :)"
,Aterman,2009-10-15T11:01Z,"There isn't a simple way of say this...the rar files have something to be desired. Each file is for a separate program. The one I was looking for isn't complete. I tried to run the ISO at the end, thinking it would simply burn a DVD for me, but that isn't so. It burns an install face for everything but nothing is attached to the install itself. IS THERE A WAY TO GET THIS TO WORK!!!"
