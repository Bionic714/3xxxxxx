It's a bit late since - according to the latest polls - 85% of the US population know it was an inside job, but that don't seem to stop them from pretending to be normal people on message boards, commenting on this forum, and so on...

Haven't realized 9/11 wasn't done by 19 arabs with box-cutters yet? Download this movie - and research 9/11! And beware that it's not just DoD who don't want you to know the truth, all NATO governments are still pretending there is a ""war on terror"".. download this video - and other 9/11 videos - and compare the evidence against the propaganda on state TV."
,PerSørensen,2007-01-04T12:14Z,@ odnaix what you meant to say was that 85% of the US population THINKS it was an inside job. 
,intheb0x,2007-01-07T18:49Z,"i keep seeing this 85% of americans thinks it was a inside job..
just pure bs and nothing but speculation just like all these films.

you still ahvent posted proof to where you got these numbers.
i think your making them up to be honest.
yes fox does provide both sides of the story.
for once a news agency that does.
whats wrong with a news agency that shows both sides?
unlike all the others that are so far left they show only but the death in iraq and never the positives. but yet there so many far left stations but only 1 that shows both sides but fox news gets the most picked on.

funny"

,Brig22,2008-01-10T05:56Z,"This video is not working properly. I believe I have all the required codecs, so I doubt it has anything to do with that.

There is no audio.

It freezes at 36 seconds of playing it

The seeker bar is inoperable. "

My uncle loves O'reily and asked me if I watched his show. I said I do only if I am in the mood to be entertained and not informed."

,C0RPSEGRiNDER,2009-01-24T23:27Z,If I hear the phrase 'cover up 9/11' one more time I'm going to get really pissed off. The government is evil but they aren't geniuses. 
,Monkeybob,2009-04-05T02:10Z,"Horrible video quality. I really don't see why anyone would upload a 700mb file with quality this bad. Sound is good, but the video is terrible. Find another torrent if you want something that is watchable."

,ShutUpFoo,2009-12-17T20:55Z,"@C0RPSEGRiNDER 

9/11 COVER UP. Do something. They aren't geniuses? They send men to outer space. What the fuck have you done lately?"
