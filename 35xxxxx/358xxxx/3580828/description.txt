Synopsis from the boxcover:

It's a story about Japan's first scientific expedition to the Antarctic in 1958, where Ushioda and Ochi were confronted by a severe winter with their 15 sled dogs. Later they were forced to abandon all of their sled dogs in an attempt to get back home safely. They apologized for not taking the dogs with them, but people were angry and upset that they left all those beloved dogs behind. A year later, when they returned to the Antarctic to search for the dogs, they found something incredible...two of the sled dogs were still alive, agains the odds of extreme weather conditions.

Disney remade the story as "Eight Below."
This, the original story is more truthful to actual events (and brutal in comparison) although the film makers increased the actual number of dogs involved from 9 to 15 according to some sources.

IMPORTANT INFO!

This is a re-seed of the original torrent uploaded to The Pirate Bay back in July (2006) and it is identical except it now includes the missing VOB file which was placed into a separate torrent when I discovered that discrepancy.

If you are trying to complete the version of the torrent that had the missing VOB file and you didn't yet have that file, do this:

Create a blank file using Notepad and name it "VIDEO_TS.VOB" (without the quotes) and place it into the Antarctica VIDEO_TS folder with the rest of the files. Do not delete any of the files you would have already previously downloaded. Download the .torrent file for this version and tell your Bit Torrent client to save to the same folder as your original. Your Bit Torrent client will then verify the percentage and complete the torrent from whatever percentage you had achieved at that time.

If you are acquiring this video for the first time you need not do anything except download as usual.

My apologies to those of you on other trackers who were not able to complete the original file.
