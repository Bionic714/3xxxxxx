,uraphake,2006-12-21T02:55Z,"Just wanted to add that my upload speed is about 40 kB/s so this will take some time. I'm here for the long haul so don't worry.
Also, I forgot to mention that the soundtrack for this movie was by Vangelis. This is where his famous ""Antarctica"" music came from."
,kolosok,2006-12-21T03:38Z,Many thanks!
[V],pryll,2006-12-21T07:31Z,thank you. Looking forward to see this one.
,phisi,2006-12-21T17:07Z,Thanks a lot for the reseed.
,uraphake,2006-12-22T05:24Z,"No problem Phisi! And to everyone else, you're welcome too.

Some of you might know that we've had a blizzard here in Colorado over the last two days. When I came home this evening, the cable Internet connection was out. I know it must have been out for at least 3 hours or longer - I have no way of knowing - but it's back on now. I hope this didn't discourage anyone. What's really discouraging is the nearly 3 feet of snow that I'm now enjoying. :P"
,uraphake,2006-12-23T22:01Z,"My Golden Retriever didn't care much for this movie.
Go figure. :)"
,uraphake,2006-12-24T19:00Z,"Now that the reseed of this is completed, I just wanted to wish everyone a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!

Also, I thank all of you for your patience. If you have any problems or any questions don't hesitate to ask.

Cheers!"
,uraphake,2006-12-24T19:56Z,"My previous comment is retracted to the 8 people who left as soon as they completed the file. There should be 15 seeders along with myself right now instead of just 7.

Bunch of leeching Scrooges!"
,buffyben3,2007-01-09T13:56Z,"Thanks for the reseed,uraphake.I will be keeping this on my HD for a long time for others to enjoy."
,uraphake,2007-01-17T15:31Z,"Thank you, Buffyben3.
And thanks to the rest of you who have kept this torrent alive.
To those of you out there who have not seen this movie and are reluctant to download, my advice is: Try it. You'll like it. The Disney version (Eight Below) really sucked eggs in comparison to this, the original."
,freebluewater,2007-03-13T16:05Z,"please keep this torrent alive, we almost in 99.7 % ...."
,azalea2001,2007-04-03T23:13Z,Does anybody still seed or is it just a waste of time to try and download it?
,asp4dos,2007-04-09T09:44Z,"seed this thing, por favor..."
,asp4dos,2007-04-11T20:50Z,i see that the torrent is being re-seeded. to whomever is reseeding: please specify your time-zone and when do you usually seed. and thanks...
,azalea2001,2007-04-15T05:36Z,thanks to the person who is currently seeding!!!

,ryosumy,2007-08-15T10:24Z,"Please, seed or reseed this Movie... I try to download it during last two months and it still not finished... Thanks a lot!"
,MaxSardius,2007-11-12T06:26Z,Can someone please seed? A bunch of us are stuck at 97.3%. Thank you :)

,yuzuosu,2008-06-11T10:22Z,"Please, someone seed..."
,Rexje,2008-06-16T11:53Z,"uraphake 
Please continue seeding untill we have finished, as there is only 1 seeder at this moment! As soon as I have completed the download, I will help seeding.

"
,Rexje,2008-06-18T16:16Z,"Please guys who have finished this download, please seed untill the others have completed this torrent also!!!
"
,Rexje,2008-07-04T15:04Z,"The succes of a site like this is depending on the members who continue to seed for others, after they have finished the download themselves.

But what is happening here? Nearly every one who recently has finished this wonderfull movie, stopped to seed! Hello, my friends: That is not what is agreed when you joined this club! P2P means sharing, so why don't you seed a little while untill others have downloaded this movie from you?

Uraphake uploaded nearly a year many GB to many members, and I have recently uploaded at least 60 GB in a few weeks. Time for others to take over, isn't it?

So, I will contineu a few days to upload this movie, but then others (who are downloading at this moment) have to take over!! I will remove this torrent from my PC, so don't ask to keep seeding.

,cslowe,2008-07-05T06:49Z,"Thanks! too bad there's no english subs for the extras, but still a great upload. So once more, thanks for the effort of uploading this:)"
,uraphake,2008-07-14T11:44Z,"I uploaded this movie in December of 2006. It is now July of 2008. I took this off of my hard drive about 8 months ago -- it was becoming a real drudge coming in off an on to keep it alive.

That's why I uploaded the smaller DivX version for those of you who don't take P2P seriously enough to carry the load for a good while after completion. However, I am satisfied to see that this torrent is still going and would like to thank those of you who have done a man's job by seeding. Thank you!"
,Murgen,2008-08-03T05:38Z,Thanks for this movie. I've been looking for it for a long long time since seeing it on VHS. I'll continue to seed it for a few more weeks! 
,Phov,2008-09-13T16:06Z,"Hi,
Thanks a lot for this great classic. I?ve dloaded the DivX version... but I?d really like to have the full DVD too. 

I?ve been dloading it for almost 2 weeks now. Up to 90% (6.46 gb). Please keep seeding! I will too. 

And thanks for making this possible.

Phov"
,Penelope987,2012-03-15T13:10Z,seed please
