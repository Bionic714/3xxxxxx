,giggedyguy,2008-04-25T07:44Z,"Unless you know for a fact that your hardware is ALL supported with 64-bit drivers, then you shouldn't install xp 64. I ran it, discovered no available drivers for my Dell Latitude D830, couldn't run Power Iso or Alchohol or even Acronis True Image! So beware."
,meowing,2009-01-03T03:33Z,"@giggedguy;
That's a load of nonsense. I've been using XP x64 for ages now, and never had one iota of a problem finding drivers for it. 99% of all hardware is fully supported. Besides, the Windows server 2003 is such a heavily backed Server OS by so many companies that it will be a cold day in hell when a manufacturer decides NOT to develop drivers for XP x64 and 2003 x64.

Don't believe the hype! It works fine. Just not THIS version. I would try a more recent XP x64 here on piratebay."
