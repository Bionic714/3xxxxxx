I missed this by a couple of days in the cinema & ahve been looking for an Eng sub version.
Props to you."
,Psycho0124,2006-12-29T08:37Z,"Hey no problem. My apologies for the slow initial seed. ADSL with upstream limited to around 60KBps.

For any future releases i might do, is it prefferable to shoot for smaller size/lower quality for ease of download or are high quality rips what people want despite the size?

Also I find that torrents which contain multiple spanned archives dont get seeded as well and with the high compression allready in the Xvid and MP3 audio codecs they dont reduce size very much anyway so just sharing the file seems best. Anyone have any reason to compress?"
,Crackzter,2007-01-05T17:57Z,"Thank you Psycho0124!
Your DVD-RIP is 1000 times better than SWsleeps version of this movie!

Thank you alot."

,BetterRedThan,2011-01-29T02:15Z,"This is a first for me, but the film 'SOPHIE SCHOLL-THE FINAL DAYS.avi' is in reality a brittany murphy?!?! film (her last i think).
given brit murf, like the majority of americans was a shallow (semi-)fascist, this is all the more disturbing.
Please take this torrent down, er like NOW!"
,hammerheadieaglethrust,2011-02-12T08:14Z,thanks
,morphirr,2011-05-10T23:14Z,"just heard about this movie & find here already, many thanks"
,grassy987654321,2011-11-27T11:15Z,"Thanks for this and thanks for the english subs. I dont know if you guys have seen the foreign movie called ""Downfall"" which is another good movie based on the last days of Hitler in his bunker. Thanks again bro for a fantastic effort."
,kibarfeyz0,2011-12-09T18:46Z,fuckin hardcoded subtitles. shit only!
,p0p0ist,2012-04-18T16:48Z,"@BetterRedThan 
what are you on about?
it's a german movie, it's not even possible to make a high profile german fascist movie in germany, if there's one country that has something against fascism it's germany.

where do you get your info? sources please, this one is http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0426578/

and I don't see the name brittany murphy anywhere, so please, if you think it is, state your sources.

anyway, even now, still, almost 6 years after, thanks for the up! my german is by far not good enough to watch the movie without subs, not yet anyway"
,buck3th3ad,2012-05-10T22:18Z,"@BetterRedThan 
in this age of IMDB you would think you'd get your damn facts straight .... dumbass"
