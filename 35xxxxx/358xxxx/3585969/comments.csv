,resonator,2007-10-10T13:13Z,"Damn, sorry about the above comment, there is nothing wrong at all with the audio in this torrent. (The fucking speaker connector had come loose from my computer.)"
,DeadGrrl,2008-01-22T23:39Z,"well supporting an artist is important if you beleieev in what they stand for, but i personnally would like to have a digital version, not just vynil.... if you know what i mean.."
,roldgold56,2008-09-11T23:48Z,I just ordered their Cd it was so cheap online compared to the fucking local stores that probably don't even have it.  
,mickeys240,2009-03-30T12:05Z,"I even went to Vancouver Canada to check out many MANY local record stores as well as EM music at burnside in PDX.  NOTHING!!   

I really wish I saw them live and purchased the CD's there when they were live in PDX.   I really can't wait to get an original pressing, or maybe a STUDIO Master of there stuff.    their mixing engineer is not the brightest  ( I really thought that some parts were to muddy on the newer cd).  But the music is just so Awe Inspiring.     This stuff is Shelfield Labs Material and Even XRCD.   Lets hope that that since they are such a niche accompaniment they do get a better master out to the masses.  It would be a shame that the best you could get would be a DAT file floating around. "
