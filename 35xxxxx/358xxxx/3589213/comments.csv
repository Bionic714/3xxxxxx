yes... klaasi70 is not responding... What a fraud! >:(

But I have something for you. :D
If you got a serial, that goes like this:

AES-171-xxxxx-[N]xxxx-xxxxx,

...you can create a new one by replacing the ""N"" by a ""3"" and vice versa:

AES-171-xxxxx-[3]xxxx-xxxxx.

This also works with:
AES-171-xxxxx-[10]-...  AES-171-xxxxx-[40]-... up to
AES-171-xxxxx-[12]-...  AES-171-xxxxx-[42]-... 

Enjoy! :)

,BritneysOrifice,2007-04-05T20:50Z,"Charonb: huh? I followed your last equation (pre-version1.21) which worked like a charm. This one has me confused. I have a serial as noted in the first part, but what does ""vice-versa"" mean?  Additionally, the equations you list after that (i.e., -[10]-, -[12]-, -[40]-, -[42]-) leave me confused as well. Where do those numbers plug into?  And finally, the ""gift"" serial you listed (thank you very much) doesn't seem to work as the format is undecipherable. Any hints about what you mean by ""x2"" and the comma (,) used?  Wish I could follow you on this one as your equation some months ago came in very handy.  Thanks again for all your mathematcial prowess!"
,charonB,2007-04-06T05:13Z,"Hi again,

1. ""vice versa"" means ""and the other way round"". So, if you have a  ""3"", you can replace it with an ""N"". It works both ways... Next time, try to use the wisdom of the internet. There is an invention called ""search engine"", ya know... like ""google""!?

2. The second set of equations was corrupted by piratebay. Originally it should say, that if your second block of numbers (the ""171""-Block not counted) begins with 10, 11 or 12, you can replace it by 40, 41 or 42, the gain will be a new serial. 

3. If you understand Point 2, the code I granted at the end, will provide not only one, but two S#'s. (BTW: It is NOT a #, that someone shared with me. So don't worry, people! :) Think logical... What could "" { ... } x2 "" mean? And could it be important, that 85,5 is the half of 171?? I dunno! Find it out for yourself. I'm  going to bed now.

Happy Easter everybody,

,BritneysOrifice,2007-04-06T08:24Z,"charonB:

First off let me say two things: first, that you're a genius, and second, this little ""puzzle"" was fantastic. Thanks very much for taking the time to explain a bit further.

I also want to say that I didn't mean any disrespect with my last post. A few things had me confused, but now they're completely cleared up. You gave me the hints I needed to snag some AES serials. :) 

A couple of responses to your points:

1. As regards the term, ""vice-versa"", I naturally knew what that meant. However, I interpreted the ""N"" in your equation as representing ""any given number"" and not, literally, the letter ""N"". :) Sorry about that.

2. Ah, understood. Yes, TPB corrupted the appearance of the equations, but they're completely cleared up. 

3. Oops! My major mistake. I was thinking like an American. We don't use the ""comma"" when as a decimal place, so this was my ignorance. I thought that perhaps the ""comma"" was a typo. Thus I didn't read ""85,5"" as ""85.5"", but saw the "","" as literal. Again, I apologize for being too provincial in these matters. :) And, yes, I agree. The latter equation does, indeed, provide two serials.  

Thanks again for all this help. I totally appreciate your work, dude. Literally fantastic and the ""puzzle"" of sorts was a treat. Next time (I hope there is a next time!), I'll be a bit smarter!

You have a Happy Easter, too."

,charonB,2007-04-06T18:26Z,"The corrected one should work (twice), if you find the right factor (Yeah, it's that, what you think!) and multiply all three blocks (!) with it. Not only the first and the last one! And don't forget the prefix (AES-...) If that still doesn't work , contact me via personal message. :/"
,BritneysOrifice,2007-04-06T19:37Z,"Ah! Worked at the Easter Egg hunt for a while last evening, but was working with the old number (i.e., 9353). It was driving me crazy. :) Funny, I even applied the proper 'factor' to those generated numbers, including the 2nd block. Glad to see the new number (8353) or my hair was going to start falling out!

Just giving it a shot now with the new number (8353). I know what the proper factor is to use on all three blocks (of course!), but I'm still missing something regarding the 1st and 3rd block ""thirds"" to add to each.

I've experimented with serials built in the following ways:

AES-171-([X2803 + (2803 ÷ 0.33)]-N2728-[8353 + (8353 ÷ 0.33)])*secretfactor

and...

AES-171-[(X2803 + 0.33)-N2728-(8353 + 0.33)]*secretfactor

... but that hasn't worked so far. I'm not completely stumped yet, but it's tricky. :) Please DON'T give me the solution; I want to figure it out.  But perhaps a very, very, very TINY bit of information might carry it over. I have a feeling you'll see the error in my own equations above immediately.

But wait! If the only ""hint"" you can give will completely give the solution away, don't give it out yet! I've liked the challenge so far, and it's a good feeling to see when an AES serial is accepted into the program. It feels like a big mystery has been solved. :) Also, I definitely see how this 'puzzle' will lead to TWO serials. Can't wait to figure them out!

Okay, no more talk.  I'm going to back to my abacus. Hehe. "

Whoa... now my noodle is really cooked. :) 

Are you saying that either of my last two equations will generate valid serials? That would mean 4 serials could be produced since each equation could produce 2 separate serials.

Maybe my equations aren't well written enough, because you'll notice that each of them produce completely *different* serial codes.

In short, the first one -divides- the first block by 1/3 and then adds the sum to the original block, and the second simply adds a flat value of "".33"" to the first block.

From my point of view, at least ONE of my equations -must- be incorrect. Could you at least tell me which one is wrong? (unless, again, both are valid and then I could produce 4 serials) I don't want any more hints, though. :)

,BritneysOrifice,2007-05-05T21:11Z,"charonB:

Yeah, I confirm that the last three generated serials (the ones using the ""19"" key, so to speak) were blacklisted in v1.60. Additionally, 1.60 deletes the serials from the Credits list, but still consistently posts a dialog box saying that you have ""Illigal Serialnumber detacted"" (their misspelling, not mine). 

Additionally, there is another problem. AES simply ceases to function entirely as a result of its detection of ""illegal"" serials, so it doesn't matter if you have any ""legitimate"" serials left over since the entire AES system 

It's a drag, yes, but luckily I tested it on a separate machine (so I still have my main FS9 machine with v1.5 working well). You should note that uninstalling and reinstalling AES (including removing the installation folder) doesn't help. You still get the ""Illegal Serial Detected"" message and AES doesn't function. A cursory search of the registry doesn't show anything to do with AES serials either. 

As always, looking forward to your thoughts on this, my wise friend. :) "

If you wanna install AES v1.70, that came out today - be careful! Anything can happen, because the developer, Mr. Pabst is really pissed off by our little chit-chat here. ;)
Most important: Lobotomize AES by using the tutorial on page 3.
Second: A Firewall should be set.
If possible Try the new version on a backup-PC. 

@Mr. Pabst: Don't be too cruel! All the little pirates here are simply too poor to spend the money, but they DO love your work! And there are thousands, who can AND do pay for it, aren't they? ;)"

If you enter a flagged serial there is now a timer, so that you can't reenter a new serial until a certain amount of time has passed. I assume that this works similar to the pin-protection of cell-phones."

I'm stuck on CharonB's code:

A__ - 19 - X944.000 - 2995.333 - 2813.111
A__ - 19 - X941.333 - 2465.333 - 2805.111
A__ - 19 - X945.777 - 3335.333 - 2818.444

Could you give me some help please? I've litteraly felt I've come within seconds of solving it, but then it throws me a curve. So far, I've figured that the outer 2 last two digits of the numbers (ie, 2818 - the 18 minus the 13 in the 2813 = 05 in 2805) numbers = the inner number, but I have no clue where the 19 comes in.

Also, and this has been bugging me for a while, what is the X in front for? A random number, or a number such as N,3,10-12,40-42, etc?

Thanks for any help, and CharonB, if you feel up to it, feel free to help :).

Thanks in advance!"
,BritneysOrifice,2007-06-21T07:53Z,"fgrivel:

I think you might be experimenting with one of charonB's ""old"" equations. Those no longer work with the current version since one or more Aerosoft spies who lurk here figured them out as well.

If you track back in this thread to Page 13 and back, you'll note that several people here received serials *privately* from charonB. Of those serials, only ONE was ""blacklisted"" by Aerosoft.  Hence the constant request for a SINGLE extra serial, for which charonB provided a nice little puzzle/equation for on Page 13.

That last equation on Page 13 is the only one of charonB's puzzles that will generate a valid serial. You'd need to have the *privately* released serials if you want to have more than the 10 credits provided by the puzzle on Page 13.

As regards that last puzzle, it's very easy. Think simply and it will come to you. I know I wracked my brain for a while on it until I realized that charonB, as always, gave us the most obvious hint.

Hope you figure it out. As for the privately released serials, I do believe that charonB is no longer releasing them since they might be compromised by Aerosoft spies."
,charonB,2007-06-21T09:02Z,"@all&Britney: Almost a perfect answer. :) But the reason, why I don't send the private mail anymore is not the spy. It's the spirit of PirateBay that should be revitalized: I ""seeded"" the codes for a very long time now. So: Feel free to pass the set on via eMail, if someone requests it here. BUT: Don't publish the codes publicly or create a torrent. That would kill 'em all in v2.0 for sure! On page 13 I wrote a longer statement on this.

,mem1991,2007-07-15T19:49Z,Hi I need help deleting aes i want to get rid off the keys and all please help
,PsyberMind,2007-07-15T20:10Z,"Ok so I have just recently stumbled upon the Flight Sim world, after taking a very long Heitus (Last version I played was 4, WAYYY back in the day) And I now play it religiously. Hell I even belong to a VA now (never thought I'd see that) anyway. I've been racking my brain for AES, trying to figure out how to crack the ""Code"" and am comming up with bupkiss. I have version 1.8 now (I think, according to aeshelp.exe). If someone could toss valid codes to me at psybermind@gmail.com it would be superb. Also, I'm looking for the LevelD 777 if anyone has it. I've got the 767 already. PMDG and LEVELD 4Life"
,allanssong,2007-07-15T21:29Z,"Ok I have this much figured out.

AES-111-22222-33333-44444

set 2 of numbers multiply by three is always one hundred and seventy less than set 4"
,planefreak,2007-07-15T23:55Z,"mem1991, look on page 3. it explains how to erase aes completely."
,mem1991,2007-07-16T01:05Z,hi ive tried but i dont get the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\aerosoft\ [cryptic string] bit and other bit
,RamboHH,2007-07-16T02:07Z,"allanssong,
I dont get it ... what you mean?
how we can do it ?"
,allanssong,2007-07-16T02:50Z,"Example>>>>

AES-111-22222-33333-44444

Take second set of numbers = 22222

Multiply by three = 22222X3= 66666

Now set four of numbers is always 170 LESS = 66666-170= 66496

Thus

AES-111-22222-33333-66496

Now, X and N are just there instead of Zero, so if you see X3456 it's really just 3496.

Look at it, take that second set of numbers from ANY serial and the last set is always, set two multiply by three minus 170......"
,planefreak,2007-07-16T03:48Z,"mem1991, if u erase the aerosoft folder in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE, it should erase  aes completely. i tired and it worked for me. :)"
,allanssong,2007-07-16T03:50Z,"MEM:

You need to use ""Regedit"" to get to that.

Look it up on how to use it on Google, it's really simple."
,planefreak,2007-07-16T03:53Z,"mem 1991, i didnt quite understand ur question so what i answered above is what i think that u had problems with. if it doesnt answer ur question, ask me again but more clearly. :)"
,allanssong,2007-07-16T07:47Z,"Noticed in the reg code it looking like this under ACK>>>>

KEY001 

!!!4MPXX112411111112 1818153115

With the formula, less one on each number & digit and you get this...

4 = 3 credits
MPXX = LOWW
1124 = 0013 (about the 13th released)

11111112 = 00000001 (all active airports have this in the code)

The last 10 digits are the date and time, in this example = 07 07 04 2004

Thus: 2007 July 4th 20:04 hrs (the date and time you activated the airport)

Also:
[ = letter Z
: = number 9"

,busyinny,2007-07-19T19:22Z,"Had tried to do some work on this before. The '33333' block is definetely the toughest one and it certainly does not appear to be linear. Charon had shared a couple of serials a while back that had all blocks match apart from the '33333' block. Based on that I had attempted to do some work to see whether I could figure it out but didn't get anywhere conclusive. I was wondering though whether the fact that 22222 and 44444 have that 170 worth of difference has anything to do with the fact that the 111 block always seemed to be 171. Played around that a bit too, but again nothing final. Would love to work out the formula behind the '33333' block so if you are interested in including me in the 'math' puzzle, please email me at busyinny@yahoo.com."

Greetings once again, my friend.

There's a rumor that AES 1.9a (updated today) has a new protection system. Apparently, it makes AES disappear (including the gates) after a short time in the sim. This happens even if you have added new credits. 

Can you verify this at all? Is this your experience?

If it's true, Oliver has apparently gotten real smart about the serials floating around. :|"
,charonB,2007-08-17T02:49Z,"Greetz, BritneysOrifice and all you others!

I dunno. Have no time to fly or experiment around these days. :/

A question:

Does the new version refuse to take older serials that are definitely blacklisted, or does it accept them (seemingly) in this new version, just to activate the blockage later on?

Maybe some of you could make some more tests like:

? Lobotomizing
? Reinstall of the original v1.90 (let's call it ""v1.900"", ok?)
? Adding only one serial at a time

... and report to me? 

@BritneysOrifice: I'll send you a serial, that was never posted anywhere, so you can work with it as a 100%-clean probe! :)

Greetz,
charonB

PS: AES v1.900 can be found here: http://www.m3gaupl0ad.com/?d=LK3TWC58 (You know, what to do - TPB has blocked the ""m""-word :/ )

It's one more case of RTFM!!! :) Last night I feeded AES v1.90a with every serial, that was ever posted by me anywhere. Then I activated an airport and everything worked fine and without any problems. That's the first good message. 
The second one is, that I think, I know, what caused the dissapearance of the gates at some installations. You forgot to activate the airports. AES-Support will be given to every airport by default (DEMO-Mode.) But only for a while. This is an old feature, that existed even older versions of AES. Read for yourself:

''All airports where no credits are needed go directly in FULL mode when they are activated. All others will show DEMO and will only run AES features for 10 minutes in FS before switching them off.'' (AES-Manual)

AES-171-X9168-29412-27334

Some of them get refused immediately, but there are also some serials, that are seemingly accepted, BUT get recognized as illegal serials after some hours. So take care and don't use 'em!

I hope, this helps to clear the confusion! ;)

,thedragonweb,2007-08-26T10:37Z,"Slasherblazer.
the way to activate infinite airports for 10 credits is to uninstall AES and kill the keys in regedit and install again (you also have to delet the AES files in FS9).
So with 10 credits you can install another airports, but you will use just 10 credits.
This way is use if you don't want your activated airports anymore and replace by anothers."
,thedragonweb,2007-08-26T10:45Z,"It's impossible to activated all the airports at the same time.
But if you fly on IVAO ou VATSIM, you can activate the airports of you fligth befor start FS9.
Simply uninstall AES kill the regedit keys (search for ""aerosoft"", ""AES"", ""VB and VBA program setting"" and kill the keys) go to FS9 install folder, Aerosoft/AES and delet the folder. go to Module folder and delete ""AeroCore.dll"".
So after that reinstall AES, enter your serial key.
Then you have 10 credits again and can activate other airports. You loose the old activated airports but you have AES with 10 credits for another airports.
Am i clear enough ??"
,thedragonweb,2007-08-26T10:48Z,"Yes it's more complicated than to use another keys to add more credits.
But if you don't have the keys or if you are to lasy to make a key generator, then use my method.
You'll loose 15 minutes, but you will be able to activate another airports."

,charonB,2007-08-31T06:54Z,"Hello everybody!

It seems, that AES v1.90(a) corresponds through the stupid little [U]aerocore.dll [/U] with his big bad mama (the aerosoft server) and get's the infos about the latest blacklisted serials. 

I'm not sure at this point, but after killing it (it always installs, when you add an aerosoft product, if you want it or not) from the modules-folder manually and trying with a bunch of ""delayed"" blacklisted serials. nothing bad happens anymore - for 24 hours now. 

So try this:

1. Do a fresh installation of AES v1.90a.
2. Kill the stupid aerocore.dll which is good for nothing!
3. Enter some of the ""delayed"" blacklisted serials.
4. Fly around for some time. ;)

I guess that should do it, but I'm not sure... 
Please report your experiences! :)

,BritneysOrifice,2007-09-01T00:39Z,"charonB:

Or, perhaps, aerocore.dll is just one thing that's calling home. Maybe the Vimacore DLLs do it. Oliver's getting sneaky; maybe he has a 'fallback' to the aerocore.dll.

Or, perhaps, the above user is simply using universally blacklisted serials that are already accounted for in AESHelp. The only real way to find out is to list the serials used. 

Ironically, if we do that here, they'll be found anyway. :|"
,Phio,2007-09-01T07:06Z,"Hi

To charonB and BritneysOrifice:
When this happend I had not killed the aerocore.dll. I have not used any serials that been blacklisted in charonBs posts on page 24 or 25.

Youre aerocore.dll thoughts might work anyway. I have now killed aerocore.dll whit the same serials.

Can you send some serials to algisrr@yahoo.com, thanks for your help!"
,thedragonweb,2007-09-04T00:22Z,"Use my methode, it's really simple. You just have to get a valid licence key before that.

1. First, make a new folder. Copy in this folder the  AES installation file and rename it aes.exe.

2. Make a .reg witch kill regedit entries of AES. Name it like this example AesClean.reg.
And put this in :

REGEDIT4
[-HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\VB and VBA Program Settings\{HERE WRITE THE KEY}]
[-HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Aerosoft\{HERE WRITE THE KEY}]
[-HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Aerosoft\AES-Base&&AirportPack - FS2004\]
[-HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\MenuOrder\Start Menu2\Programs\Aerosoft\AES-BasePack]
[-HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\App Paths\AES-Base&&AirportPack - FS2004]
[-HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\{HERE WRITE THE KEY}]

(remplace the ""HERE WRITE THE KEY"" by the key you will find in regedit, i don't know if it's a personal key so i don't give mine) Save the file.

3.Now make a batch (a .bat file)witch erase all AES files.
And put something like this:

AesClean.reg
cd\
C:
cd Program Files\Microsoft Games\Flight Simulator 9\Aerosoft\AES\
del *.* /s /q
""X"": ///// Replace X: by the Hard drive where you put the batch and the reg folder/////
cd X/X/X/X ///replace the X by the folder where you put the batch and reg files///
AES.exe

In this exemple i use the original installation folder of AES. Be careful with this, because if the batch don't find the folder it will erase all the files of the last known folder (for me it was D: and erase all the files...) So be careful !!!!

Replace the lines where i put ""/////"" and delete the comments... 
//// "
,thedragonweb,2007-09-04T00:24Z,//// 
,thedragonweb,2007-09-04T00:25Z,"the slash are not a comment or a command line and it will stop the batch.


So, with this way i made a full auto uninstall and kill regedit key and reinstall command for AES.
Now It takes me exactly 20 secondes to clear and reinstall AES ready to enter my only licence key to activate another airports. With the 10 credits i bought, i can activate any airports just before a flight by using this method. I have a valid key witch never will be blocked, and i can use it anytime i want.

Last advice, be careful with the DEL command. If you don't know how to edit a batch just forget it."
,Skylink*Wien,2007-09-04T09:10Z,"""thedragonweb""can't i just do what u said manually?without the batch and etc.It's too risky :D"
,charonB,2007-09-04T09:16Z,"Ok, the mystery is solved! :)

The aerocore.dll is responsible for the delayed blacklisting! I ran my AES stuffed with blacklisted serials for many days now and nothing bad happened (without aerocore.dll, of course.)

Then I tried to put it back, started my FS and the first thing I see is that ugly red AES-Alert.  :/

Interesting to mention, that, if you remove it again, before starting the aeshelp.exe, the problem vanishes. Only if you leave it in its place after the red alert and then open the aeshelp.exe, you'll have to ""enter xy valid serials"". 

So, my recommendation: Replace aerocore.dll by any .dll-File, that you renamed to aerocore.dll before (I use the F1View.dll.) Then you set it to write-protected. :D So, if any aerosoft-product is out to install its little spy, it fails. Hehehe! :cool:

Have fun!
charonB

PS1: I think, with AES v2.0 the pseudo-blacklisted serials will be REAL blacklisted ones. But well, ... tomorrow is not today... ;)
PS2: Nice work, thedragonweb! :)"

It is possible to make my methode manually, it will take more time, something like a couple of minutes.

Then in Registry i Found....

In my case, there's an ""ACK"" folder as well as a ""CED"" folder, so maybe the names are different. However, it's interesting to note that I also don't see any key to change the protection from 0 to 1. Any further hints?

,theperfectpirate,2007-11-17T05:42Z,"Hello,
To every AES user and specially for the experts like CharonB:

I was using AES normally and everything worked fine until I installed London Heathrow 2008. That installation caused me a lot of trouble. Since that day AES ( especially v.190a) recognizes that I used ilegal serials on the past. Although I used some 'solutions' ( like lobotomizing and replacing AeroCore.dll), I keep having the problem. Everytime I have to enter new serials to keep it working, but of course ther's always  an end and I get out of serials.
As a result I personally ask the 'Experts' to try and fix this problem. There has to be a file that does the recognition. Everybody here will apreciate the work you will do for us.

,pirateaero,2007-11-19T18:36Z,"Ok guys i have the solution for all you people.

ok so the only way aerosoft can blacklist your stuff is via web programming.

SO

here is a simple step by step for you all to follow IF YOU HAVE BEEN BLOCKED FROM AES
its more simple and detailed version of whats on page 3 ok.

1. Uninstall AES
2. Go to the Aerosoft folder in the main FS9 folder and delete the remaining AES folder
3. go to the start menu click Run, and type Regedit.exe.
4. When the folder opens click HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\aerosoft\{D48E210F-8F8C-404e-B3D7-F4BF6881F193}
	Delete this file
5. Then click HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\aerosoft\AES-Basepack&&AirportPack 
	Delete this file
6. Then go to HKEY_USERS\S-1-5-21-1214440339-1450960922-839522115-1004\Software\VB an VBA Program Settings\{D48E210F-8F8C-404e-B3D7-F4BF6881F193}
	Delete this file aswell
ok so the 6 simple steps are done.

Download and re-install your AES, once you have installed this do the following steps

1. Disconnect the internet
2. open AES and add all your serials blacklisted or not.

and your AES should now work fine make sure when ever you open AES you are not connected
to the internet at the same time same when you fly aswell, all is now done my friends hope this works.

Worked fine for me, always ensure your internet is DISCONNECTED when you use FS or AES or
both

All previously airports are still unlocked (sure thing), none of my 7 serials got blacklisted or deleted or anything and for some reason I see this wonderful line:
 - 2335 credits left - 
Total: 70 + Bonus: 2265

,Falcon1964,2008-02-05T14:45Z,"THIS IS HOW I DO IT!!!!!!!!!!!
First install version 1.93, then use these serials:
AES-171-X8426-18210-25108	
AES-171-X8444-29190-25162	
AES-171-24316-N9300-72778	
AES-171-24350-29244-72880	
AES-171-24358-13530-72904	
AES-171-24358-N4584-72904	

Now you have 72 credits. After this you can install version 1.94.
DO NOT UNINSTALL VERSION 1.93 !!!!
Works perfect for me."

We all know, that we shouldn't be connected to the internet while using AES with illegal serials.
But is it possible to block internet connection only for AES (firewall for example)? In this way AES would be blocked, and we could use ActiveSky with internet connection enabled at the same time..."

,charonB,2008-09-28T15:56Z,"=======================================
Fresh serials are out. You have mail (pages 57-60.)

Enjoy, ;)
charonB

PS1: Please DON'T use [dot] or [at], because I have to remove them manually, what is very annoying. If you're afraid of spam, create a new account for AES-purposes as described on the first five pages of this thread. Also please put the email-adress alone in one line of your comment. This way, it's easier to mark for me. ;)
PS2: Please DON'T do multiple requests until a now round is opened (now it is!) If I'm not answering immediately - be patient, I won't forget anyone.
PS3: Unfortunately, selfdestruct.com terminated it's service. That's why I had to learn more about remailing techniques and the vast possibillities, that emerge from it. Using Quicksilver now, working with 3 bounces, 3 copies, so the propability of losingit on it's way to you is rather small. Delivery time varies between 2-10 hours, so don't panic! ;)

PS2: Please DON'T do multiple requests until a now round is opened (now it is!) If I'm not answering immediately - be patient, I won't forget anyone.
PS3: Unfortunately, selfdestruct.com terminated it's service. That's why I had to learn more about remailing techniques and the vast possibillities, that emerge from it.

Fresh serials for v2.02 are sent right to you! You should have mail. [pages 66-68]

Enjoy, ;)
charonB

PS1: Please DON'T use [dot] or [at], because I have to remove them manually, what is very annoying. If you're afraid of spam, create a new account for AES-purposes as described on the first five pages of this thread. Also please put the email-adress alone in one line of your comment.

PS2: Please DON'T do multiple requests until a now round is opened (now it is!) If I'm not answering immediately - be patient, I won't forget anyone.

PS3: Unfortunately, selfdestruct.com terminated it's service. That's why I had to learn more about remailing techniques. Using Quicksilver now, working on 3 bounces, 3 copies, so the propability of losing it on it's way to you is rather small. Delivery time varies between 1-10 hours, so don't panic! ;)
