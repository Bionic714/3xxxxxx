,Crazypunkrock,2008-05-03T06:30Z,"for those that it asks for registration code.
acopy the neat image application to the install directory, usually c:program files/neat image and over write the old one.
then click on the start icon, go to run an type regedit, go to file an clock on import, search for the ssg file located in your download directory, an click ok, then it will work fine for you"
,den_fly,2008-09-05T18:27Z,"still, cannot use the neat image plugin. It doesn't save, saying that the copy i not registered.
The standalone is registered, but does not allow for RAW editing....
