Are you deformed and can only view 5 frames per second or something?"
,k-t-m,2007-01-03T16:57Z,"that's exactly what this patch is for - disabling high-end shaders etc so it runs way faster, even on older rigs. polycount isn't a problem for most machines (doom 3 runs fine on voodoo2 cards), shaders, filters etc are!"

 Probably because they're supporting little spoiled brats who post on torrent sites...."
