,mattvingar,2007-01-19T17:18Z,Can som one upload only key generator?
,langleyk1,2007-01-28T01:54Z,Could someone give a little help on the install.  When trying to install network deployment it asks for serial?  Is this right?
,smurfenglubb,2007-01-28T10:44Z,"The serial can be wathever u like i have noticed... I used: ""111-20111111"".
But I have another problem :). I can't start the program! The licence shit is very annoying and I apparently got it all wrong... well well... I have to find anoter torrent maybe :("

,stink_foot,2007-02-25T15:25Z,how do I get the text tool to work ?
,uschwarz,2007-03-02T19:55Z,"No viruses and no trojans.  It's the real thing, but the instructions don't match this version of Inventor.  Good luck installing it!  Also, this is the Pro version.  The Pro version requires XP Pro or other 64-bit Win OS.  XP Home is not supported.  I sure wish it was and I knew how to install it."
,snikende ullteppe,2007-03-04T02:44Z,Anyone installed this on Windows XP Media Center?
,Andreas Ehn,2007-03-06T20:19Z,"boy!! shure needed this one...getting the final touch on my house drawings, my 30 day trial expired!!

Thanks a lot!"
,mush360,2007-03-20T06:57Z,"Works on all versions of XP. However there IS a slight problem in loading the fastener Libraries. To fix that problem I used the previous version of Inventor 10.  

For the breast cancers who can't find the keygen:

Inventor 11 does NOT run under any version of Windows Vista. But Dassault SystĂ¨mes SolidWorks 2007 works just fine."
,stink_foot,2007-04-08T19:55Z,the text tool dosent work if you installed all windows updates. if you have this problem there is a fix on autodesk webpage.   
,PsychoH-j,2007-06-13T11:17Z,More seeders thanks.. :P  
,Kisakeissi,2007-10-24T10:07Z,IÂ´ve tried to install the program many times but nothing seems to work... I cant activate the program. Is there anyone who could put the accurate instructions here? Please!! I really need the program :D
,jurken1,2008-02-25T19:23Z,"Would'nt be bad if a coiple of more ppl seeded :O thx anyway, been waiting for a torrent like this! :D"
,Crevil,2008-11-12T17:17Z,"Finally got it down.

It works for me now after this method:

Choose the first link in the main window when running setup.exe. And hit the link ""Install Autodesk Inventor Professional 11""
Accept terms and so on, and when it gets to pick your working environment, choose ""Standalone user"".
When you get to the window with the overview of products to be installed, hit ""Options..."" at the right side and choose ""Network License"".
Then run the installation, I had a few keys that I was unable to write, but I just ignored it.

When finished with the installation copy the ""bin"" directory from the Crack folder to /Autodesk/Inventor 11/  and overwrite the original file.

Then edit the license.lic file in the FlexLM directory. In the first line change ""this_host"" to your computer name. Save the file and copy the folder ""FlexLM"" to /Autodesk/Inventor 11/
Create a "".log"" file in the directory, this could be: ""logfile.log"". You can do this with notepad if you don't know.

Run ""lmtools.exe"": Choose the ""Config Services"" tab.
Write ""Service 1"" in the ""Service Name"" field.
Locate the ""lmgrd.exe"" file with the Browse field. It is in the ""FlexLM"" folder.
Locate the ""license.lic"" file with the Browse field. Same folder as before.
Locate your "".log"" file that you created earlier.

Save the Service and go to ""Service/License File"" tab.
Check the ""LMTOOLS ignores license file path environment variables"" checkbox.

Now go to the ""Start/Stop/Reread"" tab and push ""Start Server"".

You are now able to run the program.
Just run the ""lmtools.exe"" and start the server when ever you want to use Inventor 11.

Good luck!"
,Legato2,2009-03-31T20:06Z,"This crap works on Win Vista... (64bit tested), but it's full with bugs. I'hate it!

But the main point is, you have to launch the setup.exe as win xp and install only the inventor 11. Thet network shit you can only change at the step you choos from the programs.... So you have to install it as single user, and during the process do you have to change this option.
After the installation there are several msg box saying..... i don't know wath... you have to skip them.... that's it!"
,hmrhead,2011-11-24T19:20Z,I tried it ... it don't work
