,kenta48,2007-12-31T16:15Z,"En stilla undran bara.
Varför envisas alla att skriva på engelska,
det här är ju ändå en svensk sida.
Men tack så mycket för ett bra upplägg på en bra film."
,Director0001,2008-01-12T16:52Z,Is this version of film on japanese language ?
,zolizoli,2008-02-05T13:52Z,"Many thanks for the seeder!
Well I think it will take some time to find the way how I can watch the movie with English subtitle, but i understand you; everyone shares his own stuffs, usually in his mother tongue (or susb in his moter tongue).
Anyway, if someone has the English version, or has this movie in avi format please seed it!"
