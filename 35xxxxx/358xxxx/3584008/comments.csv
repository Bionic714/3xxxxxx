,pip1,2006-12-30T06:58Z,"when are people going to get a clue and use AVC/x264 for their video encoding for the benefit of everyone?.

far better encodeing for far less size, try it..."
,idiotproof67,2007-01-02T14:38Z,"Ssssh!
This file size is fine, so be quiet & complain about FREE air instead."
,RaptorTorrent,2007-01-06T09:41Z,I used to encode in x264 but then I had hundreds of people complaining that they couldn't play the file and they didn't know what codec to use
,tavisjohn,2007-01-10T21:44Z,"I prefer Xvid and DiVx because it will play back on everything I have!  My DVD Recorder, My LifeDrive, My XBOX, and even my PVR MultiMedia PC!

Yes there may be better codecs out there, however few of them are playable on soo many devices!  That is why MP3 is the standard format for music players!

For me (And many other people) The easier it is to play is more important than quality.  If I have to mess arround with something to get it to work, then it is not worth it to me."
,Gandoon,2008-02-19T23:22Z,"OK the codec h.264/AVC/MPEG4 part 10 (x264 is not the codec, just a free encoder) is a really good codec, quality-wise, but the truth is that it requires much more processing power on the decoder side, which makes it less suited for lower end computers, a few years old computers, standalone players without specialised AVC processors (very few such units are to my knowledge in existans today, there will probably be more as the codec supercedes MPEG2 in HiDef settop boxes).
Disk space as well as network bandwidth is very cheap today and thus the DivX/XviD/MPEG4 part 4 encoded file, which has almost guaranteed playability, tends to be the easy choice.
Just wait a few months and h.264 will probably gain on the DivX/XviDs as HiDef gets more popular among this kind of downloads."
,kvasilistic,2008-11-04T20:56Z,"""which makes it less suited for lower end computers, a few years old computers""

True, if by ""a few"" you mean more than five or six. My more than four year old computer had no problems decoding h.264.

And by using inferior already widespread codecs you're not really encouraging companies to develop and support the new and improved codecs are you?"
,_kii_,2009-02-05T08:32Z,"xvid is still better - if you watch on a dvd-player, that is. i'm really glad that i don't have to spend time recoding this.
anyway, thanks for the upload!"
