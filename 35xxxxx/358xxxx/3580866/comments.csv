,sbrob,2007-01-22T20:36Z,"Is this with HARD SUBS? 

If not I won't bother downloading since I don't know how to get the sub-files (.svi? .svf?) to work then burning and watching on my TV from divx-player. Maybe there's a program that can burn the subs on the movie? Watching movies on my 17inch computer screen is not an option. "
,sbrob,2007-01-22T20:40Z,How is the quality of sound and picture BTW? OK or better? 
,sbrob,2007-01-22T20:59Z,Stjärnorna som ska indikera betyget på kvaliteten tycks inte lysa alls så vad ska man tro - nån av alla er 156 som har serien hemma kan väl tala om hur kvaliteten är? Och det här med hårdsubbningen?
