I have searched everywhere for this one... and finally found it. 

So I thought I should share it, since alot of people are searching for it... 

This is the UIQv3 version of TomTom 6.02 (For Sony Ericsson P990i, m600i, etc)

Just copy it to the root of the memorycard and go to the configuration menu to install the software on the device. After the installation is completed, you can select and run the program from the regular menu.

Use the included keygen to activate the maps for TT6. Only Guam map is included to activate the software. Other maps are available as torrents from this site. Just make sure you have enough memory available on the memorystick.

This one is tested on a SE P990i.

Have fun.
