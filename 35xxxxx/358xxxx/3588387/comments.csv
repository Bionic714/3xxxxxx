3. Go to menu: Tools - Control Panel - Other
4. Select Install
5. Follow onscreen instructions and start TomTom
6. TomTom will ask for activation
7. Select manual activation

,redpirate,2007-01-05T16:24Z,"I got this working on my SE w950i phone. Works perfect! Included keygen worked for the included GUAM map and with the maps found in the torrent with Western_Europe_660.1256

SE w950i users: make sure you copy everything
to the media memory root using fast transfer mode (USB disk mode)
Make sure you don't have other existing destination directory's using the same names. If so copy the source files one by one or else the existing destination directories might get lost.

Anyone know how to get these maps placed correctly on my PC so that TomTom HOME recognizes them?
