,Baleurion,2006-12-30T21:19Z,VOL? volgarian? :p what language?
,unloosed,2006-12-30T23:51Z,"It probably means ""volume"" as in volume licensing.  In other words, he (or whomever he obtained it from) got this version of Vista out of a volume purchase. "
,unloosed,2006-12-30T23:52Z,But I could be wrong...

,Amerialb,2007-01-01T18:37Z,"I have installed this and it has not asked for any activation or a key nor has it given any indication of such. However, if you do use this you will be forever attached to the tit of microsoft."

,Akbar_The_Great,2007-01-03T03:56Z,Skatt - x64 refers to the 64-bit version of the operating system. There is a 64-bit version of XP as well as Vista.

,mrblack927,2007-01-25T03:15Z,"i know, im gonna be THAT GUY and say it.... More seeders!"
,kokoloupo,2007-03-01T08:55Z,"Yeah, funny download at 5 kB/s. Many seeders upload at less 500 B/s.Could you improve your upload speed, or learn to configure your BitTorrent software?"
,kokoloupo,2007-03-02T09:56Z,"Torrent was uploaded December 30, 2006, so it is another RTM iterations yeah?

It is no actually final...?"
,kokoloupo,2007-03-02T09:58Z,And have all the same problems with some generic drivers as the other RTMs?
,kokoloupo,2007-03-02T17:09Z,"Yeah, I've just tested now this. It is a good one, but beware, there is no activation serial or crack. Only has 3 day grace period before compulsory activation, so you will have to find on your own some crack. Some generic hardware which run on XP has some problems with Vista. Any way I've managed to install the WiFi LAN USB dongle from SMC the SMCWUSB-g EZ Connect after some hacking. It works well. Onboard LAN from Intel also goes OK. Saound MAX onboard audio OK also, so onboard graphics.

Yeah, anyways OK but with some minor (or not so) issues.

I will wait a year or so to see if I migrate, by now I will stay with Win XP."
,kokoloupo,2007-03-03T12:12Z,"Ok, first of all what I'am to tell you have nothing to do with trolling or Microsoft basshing.

After investigating some compatibility issues on some hardware with Windows Vista I found that similar problems face the Windows Media Center Edition.
