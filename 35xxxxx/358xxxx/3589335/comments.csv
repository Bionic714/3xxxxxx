,Mroakman,2007-01-05T09:14Z,Very satysfying that you give som much ...really good info about the torrent. I cant bealeve the stupidness of ppl puttting up things on TPB.
,amoren,2007-01-05T17:27Z,"Hmm i can`t get it, the file all in one is 7.69gb, but whet u press to see the files (under type) then it says..
/IMAGE000.cue	337 B
/IMAGE000.dvd	34 B
/IMAGE000.iso	2 GiB
There isn`t even 2.5 gb here..

,Bacardi_AVT,2007-01-07T02:52Z,"@Mroakman: 

I can't belive that U are so stupid that you don't realise that this is a raw dump made for those of us using Xtreme FW 5.1 or 5.2 on the xbox 360 to be able to play xbox 1 games."
,Mroakman,2007-01-07T12:07Z,LOL Yeah!
,alonroz,2007-01-11T19:40Z,"So does this work on a 360?
Do I need to merge any SS files, or is this burn ready?
Any special instructions? Never burnt an XBOX 1 game for my 360 yet..."

,shoesgotsoul,2007-03-05T12:47Z,PLEASE SEED!!! by the way thanks for the upload
,IVIaleficus,2007-03-08T05:11Z,sorry its taking so long i cant seed during day much cuz my family gets on the internet and seeding and d/l torrents make it extremely slow so i usually seed at night 10 PM - 8 AM CST
,sweeznit,2007-03-11T05:27Z,Please just seed the last 1.1% lol its only 1.1 percent left common really. After its done I will seed for everyone else so you dont have to. Thanks so much!
,infernopyro,2007-03-26T00:09Z,i seriously need some seeders been downloading for almost a week only at like 34%
,BuNgi3 HuNt3r,2007-04-07T13:33Z,download my torrent is has had 40 downloads unlike this one that has had 3. it is only the iso file but that is all you need to hot swap. inject the maps into the iso then burn it onto a 4.7gb or 8.5gb disc and it'll hot swap perfectly.
,Spikoman,2007-04-09T13:37Z,"The Torrent is Dead. After xx Days 98,9%. "
,infernopyro,2007-05-09T00:40Z,if i use the .dvd and .cue from this torrent on the iso from your torrent that dosent have the cue and dvd  will it work? cause im not hotswaping i have a modded xbox 360 and i want too be able too burn this as a normal 360 backup
