asia4all, u can try guessing which one this is..."
,artytorrent,2007-10-11T22:14Z,"The good news is that the torrent is not corrupted, and the program is easy to install thanks to the AiR Setup.exe and Keygen.
The bad news is that a monstrous synth like this hogs your processor and uses a huge chunk of screen estate. You can shrink the GUI by disabling the modulation matrix/patch cords, but it's still quite cumbersome. With FL Studio 7, it was pretty hard just to choose one of the preset sounds on my old system, such was the CPU usage.
I'd only recommend this synth if you have a PC less than a year old and don't already have one of the other Moog emulations. How many phat virtual analogue synths does one person need?"
,frojo__,2008-01-22T22:40Z,"Why canÂ´t I install this?..
It says error moog modual V not present when i try to run the program after installation. 
Help would be appreciated"
,el_thompson,2008-08-22T15:37Z,"yeah, smae problem for me. IK Samplemoog instead. Far better"
,LezDawson,2009-01-10T02:06Z,"to el_thompson: No way is IK SampleMoog better than this!  It's too limited (obviously by the available samples) and the portamento is crap due to the pitch-shifting needed to try and re-create the effect.
I agree with earlier comments about how cumbersome this is though - I do tend to use minimoog V more for its simplicity.
Thanks for the up - I'd lost my installation files for this somehow, so grabbing it again from here. :)"

,tungfork,2010-09-26T05:21Z,"The cumbersome nature of this emulator is due to the cumbersome nature of the real Moog console. It appears to be a very fine emulation, indeed. If you want something easier to use, try the Mini-Moog; however, if you want the full functionality of the full-size console, I don't think you can beat this unless you have a physical full-size Moog console. Kudos and thanks to TEAM AiR and funkiez for giving the people of Arturia the opportunity to have me decide to buy their software, having had the chance to evaluate it."
