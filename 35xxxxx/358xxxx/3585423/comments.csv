,0x011304090D,2007-07-03T03:50Z,"Works great, laggy, but that's the fault of my CPU.

And no, to the stupid people on here. You don't deserve the computer you're sitting at. Turn it off and go learn how a computer works."
,bobgoober,2007-08-06T23:33Z,"Great work! A warning to all however, it will probably be a little laggy and you do need half a brain to make it work."
,philatio,2007-12-31T12:40Z,Works but too slow to be any good. Even on top spec quad-core gaming PC will only run games at a few frames per second.
