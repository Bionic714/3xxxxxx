The Infinity Combat Prototype (latest version: 2.1) is a standalone game that has been released and improved upon the past months, as a way to test many components of Infinity before it is finished.

The combat prototype is NOT the game !

This is a completely separate program that only shares the engine. It does not represent what you will find in Infinity. Its goal is, namely, to test: the graphics engine, the physics engine, the networking engine, experiment with controls / combat mechanics / balance, to improve stability/fix bugs and measure/stress performance.

The combat prototype is not meant to have a deep gameplay; do not expect any form of planetary landing. 10 ships are available to the players. The gameplay is arena (team vs team) based, while Infinity will be a fully open "sandbox" type of game
