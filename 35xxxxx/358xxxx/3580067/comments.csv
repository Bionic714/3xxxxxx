,Riastrad,2008-11-24T02:30Z,The audio quality in this video is kinda shitty. :(
,etoneto,2009-01-05T07:44Z,"""with the passage of the Federal Reserve Act of 1913...a small number of very rich men have been able to lay  upon the masses a yoke little better than slavery itself.""

Really? 

So what historical instance of slavery are we comparing the life of the average American Joe with then?

Could you point the way to the free societies without a federal reserve act so we can all go immigrate there and enjoy their utopian bliss."

,Diceman_,2009-06-12T16:58Z,"The pirates are the people who would have never known about it otherwise and if they did, would rather not watch it then pay for it.
In other words a large audience that would not otherwise exist."
,DevilPrez,2009-06-18T09:24Z,"To all and Diceman:
Knowledge is power. a Lot of information/knowledge can be found on TPB. E-books and documentaries and even the crappy comments are freely accessible to anyone. If that results in more knowledge available to the layman, the layman risens to the level of scolar in different fields of expertise. That may be exactly what this world needs. So fuck copyright, fuck the central banks, fuck NWO, fuck the Bush's and the Rockefellers, fuck religion and its ties to the money machine, fuck organised crime and above all, FUCK THE BIG WAR MACHINE WHERE A LOT OF MONEY IS DESTROYED PAID FOR BY THE TAXPAYERS....THE  SAME TAXPAYERS THAT ARE SEND THROUGHOUT THE WORLD TO 'HELP OUT' SOME STRANGE COUNTRY IN DEEP SHIT... The way to make the most money is to CONSUME a lot of money....what better way than to buy oil and burn it in a car (poluting our planet) or fire missiles worth millions of dollars each....or orchestrate a big economic crisis, grapping the money of small investors all over the world....the big corporations are not the ones in trouble, there will always be coca cola, general motors, boeing, smith and wesson, microsoft and we will probably not get rid of the Carlyle group and its cronies...."

This is stuff that everybody should learn, the same people that this movie is about, is the same people that are gaining control of the INTERNET, totally ending freedom of speech.
A movie you should show or mention to everybody you know before it's to late.
For some reason this title is not listed on IMDB, ask yourself WHY !"

[T],one_last_round,2009-12-24T06:01Z,"If you want to learn more about how the government is spying on all of its citizens check out this Documentary

BBC-Sex.Spying.Conspiracy (PBS.Discovery.History.Channel.Theory)

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5218472/BBC-Sex.Spying.Conspiracy_(PBS.Discovery.History.Channel.Theory)

Watch and see how the government is tapping your phone calls, reading your emails, and creating databases of everything about you. Companies get paid by the government to collect info on all of us. All the purchases we make. The spouse we might have or what kind of pets we have, or even our favorite color. Here we have an ex CEO of the company talking about all this. Watch as you see how some companies monitor all their employees even while they are away from work! Finally the video shows the infamous NSA and how more than 20,000 people working each day listen to your phone calls. Hear ex employees talking about it. The sources are from MSNBC, Discovery Channel, and History Channel along with others. Not only is this evidence but it comes from high sources and it takes you right to the heart of where this is all happening. 

And this is just part 1 of a four part series."
,ChimChimtheOmni88,2011-02-15T02:55Z,"While searching for this movie I also found 'The Secret of Oz (The Revised Money Masters). I'm torrenting that film as well as this to get both sides of the story. From the description, it sounds like the movie (or at least the uploader) is anti-zeitgeist, but also anti-capitalist. I could just wait until the torrents finish and compare the two, but any unbiased insight into this 'revision' would be appreciated."
