,Motivsprechr,2007-03-09T04:20Z,"WTF is going on with this torrent!?!

Two IP ranges are seed/leeching this.
208.10.23.xxx
and 
38.100.24.xxx
38.100.25.xxx
38.100.26.xxx
38.100.27.xxx
38.100.134.xxx
38.100.135.xxx
And I'm stuck at 97.9%

This looks like a brute force attack on this torrent and PG is not blocking it, yet...
