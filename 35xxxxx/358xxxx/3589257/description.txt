Jubb & The Dirty Sleeves

Up Until Now

Hello,

I was asked by Matt our bass player if he could come round mine and record a couple of the songs that we had written on to my four track whilst Leon our drummer was away. We got rather carried away; and before we knew it the thing had become a 16 track CD with our friend Laura playing Violin on one of the tracks, and me and Matt spending the time when we should of been doing Christmasy things sat in my room at my Mum's house, getting sick of the sight of each other, recording all the songs we had written in Jubb & The Dirty Sleeves as well as some earlier ones.

The whole thing was recorded on to a 4 track that I had received a few years earlier for Christmas off my Dad, then mastered on to a reel to reel then finally recorded on to my pc so i could burn cd's etc..


So here it is for you to have a listen to. I thought I would upload it to our web space and Torrent it too, so as many people could get their hands on it for free.

I've included the sleeve artwork which needs to be printed on a A3 printer ideally, but cut it up or whatever in photoshop, you can get a nice little plastic sleeve from ASDA or music zone to put it all in. The CD sticker label is also included so DIY it up!
