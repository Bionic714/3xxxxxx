the mix tape, vol. 1: 60 minutes of funk - album review
Funkmaster Flex's The Mix Tape, Vol. 1 recalls hip-hop's past while pointing toward its future. Featuring a wide array of hip-hop styles graced by amazing freestyle raps by some of the '90s top MCs, the album sounds like a mixtape compiled from the radio and 7" singles -- there's simply nothing but first-rate music, with no filler whatsoever. Although there are elements of old-school rap as well as modern funk, the daring production and stunning rhymes make The Mix Tape a rarity of mid-'90s hip-hop -- it's a record that sounds like none of its competition. It announces itself as an instant classic. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine, All Music Guide
