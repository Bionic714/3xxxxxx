,korpblitz,2006-12-24T12:46Z,"You need:

1. WinRAR
2. WMP with XviD/DivX codec for video."
,nickar86,2006-12-27T09:51Z,thanks mate.... How's the quality? the last 3 I've downloaded was like crapy old VHS....
,StDrahcir,2006-12-28T07:01Z,"I have a question.  I'm semi new to this stuff.

I unzipped (using Winrar) the main movie file, but what are all those extra miscellanous files such as ""invincible.custom.swesub.dvdrip.xvid-korp.r18"" and .r19 and etc.  Do they have a certain use?"
,korpblitz,2007-01-03T16:51Z,"StDrahcir, if you unpacked main movie you should just look, doesnt work.. search for xvid at google and you will find a working codec."
,s3bb33,2007-04-26T19:37Z,"seeda, snälla ;D"
,zibra,2007-07-14T14:45Z,seeda lite snälla
