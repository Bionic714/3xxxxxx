I've downloaded and burnt your Roadstarter then of course booted my test Rig with it.
I chose Wxp as a test, the scrollbar loader started rolling with the xp 2003 logo, soon after,
 I got a full desktop with a real nice 3d graphic display of the box of Windows xp Professional x64 Edition.
 It has everything one needs to run a OS in ""virtual"" mode.
 I haven't tested all the stuff,
 but so far I think that this is a FANTASTIC creation (and a useful tool too)
If you compiled Roadstarter you're a really good programmer. Thank you ! 
For me this one is a keeper,
and something to brag about, :))    "
,mypirate,2007-04-04T11:39Z,"Downloaded and burnt it with Nero, but doesn't work. It's not booting. Any tip?"
,technosmurf,2007-04-08T00:31Z,"I can't get this to boot, either. Burned the image with both Nero and Alchohol. Tried it on Asus laptop and inside Parallels on Mac--Parallels says: ""Error loading image: DEFAULT.EZB"". Anyone else have problems?"
,technosmurf,2007-04-08T11:59Z,"The CD works on my old Dell desktop, but not on newer computers (Asus laptop and Macbook Pro running Windows XP inside Parallels). Maybe the CD does not correctly load CD-ROM drivers for SATA drivers?"
,debakaputite,2008-10-26T01:44Z,"Yes same here, it is nice, operational , and almost everything works fine! I had an issue with some files being read-only, I mean on the HDD, very strange, I can't explain it.  May be the new DELL machine is protected by some magic :) 
Or this SATA bulshit is standing in the way. 
I tried to switch it in the BIOS , the two possible modes, yes it works , no drivers needed, but something is amiss...
No viruses, not very speedy though. 
You can get the small ""Live USB edition 60 MB only"" and you can have something portable.

Anyway I will seed this Roadstarter 2.0 because it was a lot of efforts to make it , and some of the stuff is useful
