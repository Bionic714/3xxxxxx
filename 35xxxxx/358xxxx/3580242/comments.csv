,JohnyFiama,2006-12-20T13:21Z,"@bluewater: A have a question for you. Do you know where to find the Swedish version of this great product? Maybe, it's too much but I've desperately looked for the Swedish version.

Also, I'm looking for the ""Proofing Tools"" for Office 2007. I'm not referring to the Proofing Tools included in the leaked Enterprise Edition because that one only supports around four different languages. Instead, I mean the real Proofing Tools that has all the languages included, like the one you have for Office 2003 but for 2007. Sorry, this may be too much. But, I hope someone out there can help. Thanks in advance. "

Since, I've not installed this torrent I cannot confirm anything in regards to this particular software. However, I did download one of the copies of ""Microsoft Office 2007 Enterprise Edition"". And, that one didn't need any activation . I'm certainly not talking about the beta version but the final. Here's a useful link related to office activation:

Maybe you're having the same copy as me. But, if you don't perhaps the URL may provide some useful information for you. So far, however, I've not had any reasons to validate my product. And, by the way, I totally agree with you about your previous post. :) Good luck!"
,Capt Pugwash,2006-12-21T00:40Z,"The 'Wink' Enterprise release is indeed already activated, but it fails the MS validation check - the serial is blacklisted"
,Jonbajo,2006-12-21T00:58Z,wink's office 2007 does not include help files (when you click the help link in the upper right hand corner of any of the office 2007 pregrams...does this version have the help files?
,JohnyFiama,2006-12-21T03:44Z,"@Jonbajo: I don't know, since I have a copy of another torrent (by WinK), pointing to ""Microsoft Office 2007 Enterprise Edition"" and that one is already activated. All you really need is to provide the serial number which is included. And, the help section works great. Also, it includes Proofing Tools for 3-4 different languages (English, French, Spanish and one more..can't remember) as opposed to another torrent of ""Microsoft Office 2007 Enterprise Edition"" (can't remember the URL). 
HOWEVER, there are some comments, suggesting that WinK's hack of ""Microsoft Office 2007 Enterprise Edition"" is not working as far as Microsoft's new OGA (Office Genuine Advantage)  validation is concerned. 
Here's the link to the torrent I downloaded (it's the one hacked by WinK): http://thepiratebay.org/details.php?id=3556775&page=3
And, here's the quote from the person claiming that the validation does not work for that particular hack:  
irkeith at 2006-12-05 21:20 GMT:
""as of december 5, 2006 this no longer passes the genuine addvantage test..it passed a few days ago..the messages is invalid or stolen key.."" (it's from the same URL mentioned previously)"
,JohnyFiama,2006-12-21T03:58Z,"@Little Fingers: No problem! :) I suggest that you read my comment to ""Jonbajo"" here on this page for some further info in regards to the ""Microsoft Office 2007 Enterprise Edition"" torrents out there. It seems like some people are having doubts about whether it will pass the OGA (Office Genuine Advantage) validation. Also, some copy-cats have posted poor copies of this product. Like this spammer ""mitch71h"" who kept sending trial versions. To me, it looks like no one really knows if there are any copies out there that are able to not only become activated but at the same time ALSO pass the OGA. It will be interesting to see how this whole thing plays out. Please PM me if you find out the answer. I will do the same if I find any fix for this great product."
,JohnyFiama,2006-12-21T04:22Z,"Soon, someone will hack Office Genuine Advantage as well, exactly like what ""ETH0"" and ""Team CRUDE"" did with Windows Genuine Advantage. Just give it some time. I don't even think people even know exactly how the Office 2007 Installer really works because they have totally changed their entire application architecture to be more similar to Vista, which is now 100% hacked by a Russian guy."
,JohnyFiama,2006-12-21T04:31Z,"@Little Fingers: I'm not sure. Man, I'm confused. I'll let you know whenever, I find a 100% working copy."

Is there any:
MS Office 2007 genuine advantage workaround crack out somewhere on the Internet?
You can`t download anything from Microsoft download site if you don`t have a genuine copy of Office 2007. MS Office Enterprise 2007 Genuine advantage crack should solving this problem. Where is the crack??"
,dave911la,2007-01-25T03:52Z,"Has anyone been able to crack office genuine advantage yes (OGA) so that i can start downloading updates and additions to this software?
