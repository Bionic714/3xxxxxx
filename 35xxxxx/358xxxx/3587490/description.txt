 Hip-hop has had its share of fiery debuts, but few are as   
 stunningly self-assured as the Souls of Mischief's 93 'Til  
 Infinity. Though barely out of high school, the four Oakland
 MCs bring an energy and consistency far beyond their years. 
 They cast themselves as bemused observers, relating tales of
 urban violence, girls, and sucka MCs with cleverness and    
 exuberance. The production features sample piled upon       
 sample, creating a sun-soaked funk more lively and eclectic 
 than the West Coast's usual P-Funk-styled beats but without 
 the gloom of East Coast hip-hop. In 1993, Souls of Mischief 
 along with fellow Hieroglyphics Del the Funky Homosapien    
 and Casual gave notice that there was more out West than    
 languid G-funk. Indeed, the fluidity of Souls of Mischief's 
 rhymes and the freshness of their voice make 93 'Til        
 Infinity a startling debut and a hip-hop classic.

 imagine. an off-shoot of one of the mp3 scene's major
 releasing groups; developed with a different standard
 and set of ideals.  as a reaction to  the mp3 scene's
 increasing  competition  and  hostility, imagine  was
 founded with a more focused intention; the music.

 each member's devotion to music is not by unrewarding
 pride in the fastest sites, quickest advance release,
 or most releases, but by their own personal desire to
 promote the diffusion in music.

 thinking of joining? all we ask for is the sharing of
 your musical knowledge & desire to contribute quality
 recordings and commentaries at your leisure--mutually
 benefiting yourself and other enthusiasts. if you too
 are fed up with competitive, time-consuming  nonsense
 that the mp3 scene can bring out, you may be ready to
 sit back, relax, and imagine.
