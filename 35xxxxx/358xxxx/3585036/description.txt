   HOW TO MAKE XBMC YOUR DASHBOARD:

   A configurable Shortcut for your -C-Drive is included in the ROOT dir.
   It points to E:/Apps/XBMC/default.xbe by default. If your XBMC Directory is
   elsewhere you must change its Application Path by editing the .cfg file !! 
   Rename the "ShortCut for -C-Drive.cfg" and the "ShortCut for -C-Drive.xbe" to
   something your BIOS can boot (evoxdash.xbe + evoxdash.cfg) + copy both files to
   your -C-Drive. !! Double check !! you did everything right then reboot - Voila !

   2006-12-27  7441  fixed: after the vista fix, if server closed an idle
                            connection next request would fail. now if a
                            connection is idle for more than 10 sec,
                            it's completly verified before reuse.

                            render, meaning incorrect states could be carried
                            over after a windowclose animation.
   2006-12-27  7439  fixed: Moving focus onto the list did not perform the
                             focuseditem's focus animations.
