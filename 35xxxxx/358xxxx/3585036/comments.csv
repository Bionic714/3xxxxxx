,Kismeth,2006-12-28T01:55Z,"I'm sorry to say that but this is one of the most problematic releases of XBMC I've ever d/l. First problem that I've encountered is file manager's second command window. When you simply change it (cycle between windows) operations on the other are not visible. Second problem is that during movie, you can't do the 'fast forward' with thumbstick (as usual), but you have to open the console (with START button) and that thumbstick-up the movie... but... here's another problem, because time window won't disappear. Similiar situation with music, when you have to open the console to do the fast-forward, but console again won't disappear. During movie/music or whatever else, some buttons won't work. You need to close the playback. Another problem is with music again - if you've got visualization set as a screensaver when time comes and vis. is starting the music track plays from the very beginning even though it was i.e. in the middle or whatever.

Funny thing's that I encountered that issues in the first five minutes of experimenting... I'm quite scared what I find out again.

Happy thing's that I still have the old release on my PC..."
,Kismeth,2006-12-28T02:26Z,"Yup, my friend also tried it. Same problems... Work it out :)"
,siegson,2006-12-28T11:21Z,"This version is not good.

Same RC problems with TITLE and INFO button as reported above..."
,GasGiver4711,2006-12-28T13:18Z,"Thanks for the bug reports, you might want to post these on sourceforge.net, if they are unknown.
Remember that i have no influence on whats going on with the sources - i just compile ... :-)
I will closely follow the changelog and make a new release when things you reported got ironed out."

Thanks again."
