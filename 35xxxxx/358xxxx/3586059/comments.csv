,tysonbravo,2007-01-03T02:37Z,"Good course. Thanks.

But why are the pages of the workbook each separate and why'd you save 'em in Fireworks?"
,FekketCantenel,2007-01-03T06:24Z,"The pages are still seperate because I didn't want to distill them as a PDF, since the filesize would be large. Also, I'm hoping someone in the distant future will be able to change them to text while keeping the special formatting.

Photoshop runs too slowly on my computer, so I use Fireworks 4 for scanning. Also, it's better at saving PNGs (if you use Photoshop, you need to run PNGCRUSH afterwards to lower the image filesize).

Thanks for downloading, thanks for seeding, and thanks for the comments!"

Thanks (should be a great package)"
