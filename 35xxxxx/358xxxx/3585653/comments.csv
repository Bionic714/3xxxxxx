,rotagep,2007-10-11T15:14Z,"yeah what i have to say to seed this excellent film?
I think last comments tell the true.
Really why put   here this torrent if you not seed,?
or ok . i know its not easy to share and load up all times this film. But i think not only 7 people wanted to load this film. But somebody can seed it i promise i ll seed it for another 1 month after i download. ok??"
