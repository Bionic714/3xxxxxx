,AshardAsNails,2010-02-27T00:02Z,"Keygens should be run inside 'Sandboxie' software, then no infection if present will infect pc, and you can still use keygen in safe conditions

Here's a key: ML-J071-B2QC-1N3"
,Petetech888,2012-04-21T03:15Z,"When I downloaded it and attempted to copy it to another partition it said it contained a virus and had been removed. I have no software installed that gives those messages. A little suspect, and if the upload was not from a VIP I would suspect something dodgy. Any ideas?"
,Petetech888,2012-04-21T03:16Z,I forgot to mention The zip file contents were empty and there was a break in the operation if that helps anyone.
