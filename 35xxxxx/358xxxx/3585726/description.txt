input|output is Honeysound´s first compilation, gathered to
celebrate its first year promoting new Portuguese music,
for free. Located in northwestern Portugal, Honeysound
describes itself as ``just an address, a gathering, a way of
being inside music, an idea, a wide open concept...´´.
Spanned across two discs, input is dedicated to electronic
music whereas output is aimed towards punk and rock.
