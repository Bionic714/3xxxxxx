a) In it.

b) Not dead."
,xenontouchstone,2006-12-24T18:24Z,"My fault, I was missinformed, charlie was too ill to actually appear but his voice was used, the character of baron hard on is dead in the panto and this is where the confusion came from.
thanks for the correction."

At 10:32 I mentioned that he wasn't dead.
At 11:24 the BBC web site announced he was."
