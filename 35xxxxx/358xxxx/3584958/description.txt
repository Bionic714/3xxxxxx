         ?  Detailer is a  stereo mastering process  developed by  ?
         ?  Roger  Nichols  and used  in  countless hit  records.  ?
         ?  Detailer  offers   a  new   way  of   increasing  the  ?
         ?  perception of "detail"  in the mid  level of a  final  ?
         ?  mix  while  still  allowing  increased  loudness. The  ?
         ?  process involves a combination of three-band limiting  ?
         ?  and    dynamic    widening    using   psycho-acoustic  ?
         ?  processing. Roger Nichols has fine tuned the  process  ?
         ?  to produce the most  effective result with the  least  ?
         ?  amount of adjustment.                                  ?
         ?                                                         ?
         ?  Three is better than one                               ?
         ?                                                         ?
         ?  Detailer  splits  the  incoming  signal  into   three  ?
         ?  frequency    bands    that    are    each   processed  ?
         ?  independently. Great care has been taken to eliminate  ?
         ?  phase  shifts  at  the  crossover  points,  a  common  ?
         ?  problem  with multi  band plug-ins.  Once the  signal  ?
         ?  processing   is   complete,  the   three   bands  are  ?
         ?  recombined into a full frequency band signal.          ?
         ?                                                         ?

         ?  Detailer   uses  spectral   harmonic  detection   and  ?
         ?  intelligent   parameter  adjustment   to  apply   its  ?
         ?  innovative dynamic-widening processes only where  and  ?
         ?  when it is useful.                                     ?
