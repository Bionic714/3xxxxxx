The Fird film to celebrate this f***ing xmas


Documenting hooliganism on three continents, this DVD gives a uniqe insight into
the bloody hemisphere of football violence -  among the both players and fans - as well the police
brutality used to chrush these riot-likeoutburst of agressive entusiasm. the film neither condones nor promotes
violence. it simply gives a realistic picture of the rather unknown but very real and very bloody underworld
of football.  not to be vieweb by minors *smile* or the faint-hearted or people easily offended by scenes of real graphic violence.

contains no speak and have no subtitles... only music
