,TheFreshestKid,2006-12-31T16:42Z,Like I said - I highly doubt that. - If you think there is something in it ... Don't install it - eXPerience is really popular in what he/they do. - I highly doubt they would stick any of that b/s in there. - Peace

Soooo if you don't like the program - then just fucking look for another one - It is'nt that hard. - TheFreshestKid"

Det innehåller bara en massa skit,som kommer förstöra en massa."
,-Fredrik-,2007-01-01T00:53Z,"Fuck you and your fucking program. U stupid meaningless cunt fucker. And stop putting YOUR name on programs that not YOU have made. You are a complete retard!!!
Go sit in a corner for a long time"
,-Fredrik-,2007-01-01T01:03Z,"Those riskware is no virus, they are made to change original files in windows and if u want to ""change"" your windows xp to ""vista"", those files need to be changed. Some antivirus may try delete them cos they can change some of windows original files. No virus danger or unathorized access. Dont worry about that. The whole program is a bigger treat to your computer. Do not install"
,V!zal,2007-01-02T06:25Z,Yup ^^   I did'nt find anything wrong with these files - Don't know about the installment - I did'nt get to that - Just checked the files.

,mattchazz,2007-01-06T10:47Z,"you guys are idiot with your lame virus claims.  get a an anti-virus program that works right or get some knowledge to go with your program. eXPerience wrote the scripts to install this program.  In doing so he wrote a script to silently install with minimum fuss.  He has made the script available for examination.  This guy -- TheFreshestKid -- should have told you that informtion instead of acting clueless.  But, in all of ePXerience's downloads -- other idiots have made similar charges and he's pretty much showed them they weren't ready to play with the big boys.  Now join the club."

,steelcityroller,2008-02-05T08:01Z,"lol i was just googling pskill out of curiousity and boredom after an asquared false alarm...again.  i  know bloody nothing about programs and how they function on my box but i do know how to use a bit of common sense and i just google it all.  

i would love this site just for the freaks who come out like kolofon. haaha pure entertainment.
i don't think i have come across one torrent without some freak like kolofon to make an ass of themselves.

its a year old torrent and i am a nutter for bothering, but at least its a bit of closure.  i learned my lesson for the day too:  asquared sucks ass and i am going to get rid of the piece of shit.  thanks for showing me the way again pb and kolofon you should say your sorry for being such a dumbass dick.

its the polite thing to do. "
