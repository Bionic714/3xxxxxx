Here we have album number 5 from the ""wooly-hatted one"". In true Damon Gough style, it has a playful, punning title (""Born in the UK"" - a nod to his idol, Springsteen.) In true Damon Gough style, the music here is beautiful, exhilirating, uplifting and GODDAMN LIFE AFFIRMING! I hate to be so predictable, and bestow it with 5 stars, but...WHAT THE HELL?! This music is making me happy. 5 STARS it is. Let me guide you through, track by track:-

1.Swimming Pool. - Some spoken word philosophising from Damon. Would probably sound lame coming from other artists, but from Mr Gough, this outspoken love for his family sounds earnest and real. A powerful start to the album.

2.Born In the UK. - Vintage BDB. Impossibly catchy and energetic. Power chords on the piano and a Joy Division-style rolling beat. A very infectious vocal line. Be prepared to fall in love with this tune!

3.Degrees of Separation. - Piano-driven kitchen sink pop. Beautiful.

4.Welcome to the Overground. - Sounds like something from a 1970s musical!(Godspell, possibly?) This brings the album to a whole new level. Operatic backing vocals, a triumphant melody, gigantic piano stabs. The energy here is tangible.

5.Journey from A to B. - Very remeniscent of New Order's ""Run"". This contains a very captivating one-finger piano hook.

6.Nothing's Gonna Change Your Mind. - This one you know. A melodramatic masterpiece!

7.Promises. - Introspective and melancholy. Builds and builds, then the beat kicks in and this tune spreads its considerable wings! Superb.

8. The Way Things Used to Be. - Good use of slide guitar.

9. Without a Kiss. - Classical-style arpeggiated piano. Another introspective beaut.

10.The Long Way Round. - My personal favourite. A gorgeous vocal line, accompanied by an equally gorgeous muted trumpet and minor piano chords. This sounds like early Belle and Sebastian. Possibly even better.

11.Walk You Home Tonight. - Perfectly executed tune. Piano and ghostly synthesiser. This would have fitted snugly into the ""About a Boy"" set.

12.The Time of Times. - A rythm guitar heavy, golden sunset tune.

13.One Last Dance. - Upbeat ballad as a finisher. This is a beautiful love song that floats on perfect waves of melody. The climactic chorus makes this the perfect closer to a pretty much perfect album!

So there you have it. Buy the album. Slap it in the HI-FI. Feel your hair stand on end. Feel alive. "
