Amazing short film starring the great Stellan Skarsgard which I saw at Tribeca Film  Festival last year and was lucky enough to get a copy. I won\'t give away the story but suffice to say it will both shock and move you. I\'ve never seen anything quite like it. 

Director made the earlier, equally disturbing Young Poisoner\'s Handbook and also 
RKO 281, Golden Globe winning HBO movie about Orson Welles.

Here\'s  an internet review:

Every now and then a short film comes along with such a fantastic 
story that you wish it was feature length. Torte Bluma is one of 
those films.
Putting a personal perspective on the horrors of war, this little gem 
looks terrific. The cinematography is equal to that of far more 
expensive undertakings and the look is matched by the content, the 
details of which I won\'t go far into for fear of spoiling the great 
number of surprises.
A middle-aged man is doing a spot of woodwork. He calls to his 
butler for tea and everything smacks of the genteel upper-middle-
classes until he bites into a slice of cake and ants scurry out.
What happens next turns the film on its head and makes for 
something a very long way from Merchant Ivory. This fantastic 
drama is made all the more powerful and chilling by the fact that it 
is based on a true story. Want to see man\'s humanity - or lack of it 
- exposed?
You should. If you dare.
