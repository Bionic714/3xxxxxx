CloneyXXL + CloneCD v4.202 
The last version that integrated the two programmes.
Enables 1:1 CD copies to be made.
Identifies and defeats many of the protection systems used on earlier CD's.

It also integrates directly with Clone CD* so that settings to defeat the identified protection are automatically transferred.


* v4.101 or above- may work with earlier Clone versions, but not tested that myself.
