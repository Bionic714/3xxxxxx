,Regnilas,2007-06-16T13:56Z,"Hello,

I have trouble watching the 6th, 9th, 12th, 14th and 16th episode of this torrent. All the others are working fine. I'm normally using VLC media player, however I've also tries a bunch of other players but none of them works.

Does anyone have a solution or any tips for me?

Thanks."
