,Shuyin,2006-12-24T02:34Z,"WOW! Thank you very much!
We really appreciate you have uploaded it for us!
I'm wondering if you could upload 2 other albums of  Andy Mckee?  
If you own the original CD, perhaps you could also ordered with the guitar tab books, so I'm wondering if you could do us a big favor and scan it for us, and finally upload it to us all! we really do appreciate if you could do it! :D

Cheers!"
,Adoddode,2006-12-30T01:17Z,"Awsome album, and awsome seeding! Gonna Seed for a day or two guys! All that dont know who this dude is.... JUST GOD DAMN GET IT!!!"
,Gripenstedt,2007-01-18T21:39Z,"Yes! Truly awesome. Those of you that like Andy McKee check out http://www.candyrat.com. Lots of great guitarists there, e.g. Antoine Dufour, Robert Taylor, Tony McManus, Erick Turnbull and many many more. Good thing about teh site is that you can listen to samples of each and every tune. Enjoy!"

,avatar1337,2007-05-22T01:05Z,"wow he is great, I saw him on YouTube... thanks mate for uploading"
,AlteredTuning,2007-06-01T19:36Z,"Yeah thanks a lot for uploading! It's not like I need to make a living with my music or anything.

8,676 thieves. 

If you really appreciate what I am doing, buy my CD legitimately so I can continue to compose music rather than work at K-Mart. I'm not Metallica. I don't have hundreds of thousands of dollars, much less millions.  

Andy McKee"
,horakimi,2007-07-10T16:41Z,"Andy,you very best!Thank you this music!"
,Kaymann,2007-08-18T00:42Z,This guy is AWSOME!!!
,mrpyo,2007-11-04T16:11Z,Relax man. When I will be earning money I swear I will buy one of your CDs. 
,Morphicon,2007-12-09T02:18Z,"If you really enjoy his music, buy his CDs so he can keep composing. You can buy them online at www.candyrat.com - his record company."
,hansning,2007-12-11T05:23Z,"oddly enough, the more people that download this will result in more people buying the cd too.  remember, it's the same crowd that gave you this fame as well."
,ovalie,2007-12-24T17:32Z,im gonna download it then probably buy it if i like i. He is an amazing artist.
,Mytheas,2008-02-13T19:54Z,He is AMAZING!!! :D Wonderful!
,ParanoidArtemus,2008-04-24T22:31Z,"I really do love Andy's work but he does need to realize that file-sharing benefits for less known artists. (I'm talking anyone not on the top 50) We really are the reason that artists these days become more successsful. We get your name out there. I've recommended you to god knows how many people. For some reason, you'll survive.

P.S.
I bought your album after I downloaded this. So please don't assume everyone is a thief. jeesh."
,-Anonymous-,2008-05-25T03:05Z,"Very beautiful music.

On Rylynn i nearly cried because it reminds me alot about what happened in the past.."
,spangel3,2008-06-17T01:47Z,amazing seeding. I just downloaded this in 3 minutes! Thanks allot man and all those who are seeding. I will do the same!! XD
,guynamedan,2008-08-10T08:08Z,"andy-

as much as im sure you hate to hear it, i would never have heard of you if a friend didnt give me a burned /pirated cd of art in motion... I liked enough to download some. I liked that enough to want to go spend a bunch of money to see you live. I liked the stuff I pirated so much I believe you have enough talent that you deserve some money, hence Im going to buy some albums from candyrat.com... 

have a little faith.  Your music is getting out there. Even if someone pirates your stuff, its not like they were going to buy your album anyway, at least they have some badass music to be a douchebag to. 

Now im gonna go download some other mp3s of yours from candyrat.com, and share them with my friends,....... sorry if that offends you"
,Arnalion,2008-08-23T21:15Z,"@AlteredTuning

I'll buy Art of Motion when I find it.
The problem is that I can't seem to find any store which is selling it. :(

Do you have any suppliers in Sweden?
"
,niklashbg,2008-08-31T19:48Z,"Thx!
This guy is awesome! Buy the album if you fancy it, just as I did!"
,shitpuppet,2008-12-08T18:57Z,Sorry Andy add another thief to your total. 
,mhr275,2008-12-22T19:16Z,"I cannot believe you guys trying to make excuses why you steal people's music. no matter which way you look at it, you are still stealing money away from those artists you claim to support"
,relizz,2009-01-10T01:53Z,"mhr275, the fact that you're hanging out on a filesharing site kinda takes away your credibility."
,weeksamot,2009-03-03T17:37Z,10 /10 thanks :)
,coriander,2009-03-18T09:51Z,"Hey andy, I had never heard of you before TPB.  I'm gonna check this album out and if I like it I WILL buy a CD.  Really.  I make a 6 figure income and do not use TPB to save money -- I use it for convenience.  I buy lots of CDs from artists for music that I already have when I like the artist.

Best wishes,
  C."
,coriander,2009-03-18T09:57Z,"@mhr275 -- you make the mistake of thinking a download equates to a lost sale.  This is mistaken.  Many people who download an album would never purchase it if they had to pay for it.  Others never have the opportunity to buy it and others would not pay $12-18 dollars for a new CD unless they had heard the music first and were sure they liked it.

It is very possible that the benefits of exposure outweigh the theoretical lost sales for obscure artists."
,freewillly,2009-09-26T15:48Z,"Thanks for the music Andy, and remember...that some of your listeners also work at K-mart and are not Metallica either. 

Stay Real
And stay true to the music... We are not the ones hurting your cd sales... We are the ones helping you gain the fame that you need. How many other guitarists in your genre have 8,000 thieves aka ""fans"" on TPB?"
,jrbidybids,2010-05-05T05:52Z,"Wow guys.
Even though I partake in this activity, I still thought it was really bad that I do.
I do it because of convenience and lack of money to actually buy albums.
Of course when I can, I will, but that's actually kind of rare in my case.
But after reading all your comments, you've convinced me that downloading music illegally can actually have some pretty good side effects."
,Dylon87,2010-08-22T16:53Z,The power of these comments actually changed my mind and made me go into itunes and buy this album for $10. Totally worth it. 
,Tsetsu,2010-11-26T09:27Z,"@coriander

If you make a six-figure income, why don't you buy an iPod and download from iTunes?  It's even easier than TPB; since you're into convenience."
,Adjustice,2011-01-03T00:19Z,"Hi folks,

First of all: Happy New Year to everybody!

I've seen Andy McKee on youtube and then live in concert, uncomparable great music!
I talked to him after the concert. he is a real nice guy and I support him, bought his CD.
You can do that too, it's just a click away...
Yeah, iTunes, Amazon, whatever you like, it's easy to give something back!!!
But then, go, see him live, it is worth it!

And via Andy I got to know Preston Reed, check him out too, interesting...

All the best !!!"
,Ivex_Rodriguez,2012-03-19T22:47Z,"fuck it, i'm in mozambique, i can't buy no legal shit, TPB rules..."
,diablo51990,2012-04-03T09:34Z,"WOW! Just, WOW! Come the fuck on people. Don’t try at all to justify what you do. You are downloading someone’s music illegally. It doesn’t matter what your argument is ""oh, i only use this site to check out music b 4 i buy it. derp derp"". instead of just saying sorry u fuck tards seriously just have to shit out reasons to feel good about what you’re doing. I understand, i really do but when the fucking artist himself is telling you that your fucking wrong don’t try to make it an argument. He’s RIGHT! He’s had how many fucking hits on youtube alone. So, yea I’m so sure that your insignificant little ""hey man check this out"" is doing much. Also to those of you that are dumb enough to say that you can’t find a place to get his music, ITS CALLED THE FUCKING INTERNET and NOT some torrenting site, an actual website that you pay for the music you download. This isn’t that hard. Hell, half the shit online that I’ve seen that you pay for is cheaper than fucking iTunes prices. ""Well some of us do work at K Mart."" well he makes his living off of sales alone and only gets a small percentage of that. not only that but when touring he’s away from home for long periods of time if he has a woman, a kid and pets guess what he don’t get to see them and u assholes don’t make it any easier. Just fucking admit you are wrong and that the downloads here should be going toward album sales."
