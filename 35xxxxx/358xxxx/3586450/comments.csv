,wilric44,2008-03-15T04:51Z,"Need help with burning to CD.  cant convert, I used iso, I am a little rusty so any help I would appreciate.  "
,wilric44,2008-03-17T19:20Z,I guess it was my PC but now disk 1 and 3 do not want to burn.  I did not have a problem with the others.  Did anyone else experience this problem. 
,CarlosCc17,2008-03-29T07:21Z,"hey wilric44 i recommend you not to burn them, use daemon tools to mount them, or copy all content to a dvd, or do you really wanna waste 8 cds of no more than 300mb each one"
,eric_5025,2008-04-01T03:34Z,There you guys go. I have created a seed using my t3 line
,wilric44,2008-04-02T03:02Z,Your probably right Carlos but using 8 cds is nothing compared to the price of the course.
,ChromasomeZ,2008-11-05T20:58Z,"CD8 of 8 is missing
probably because it contains certain 'toolz'   ;)

when others mention the missing 8th CD, their comments magically vanish from here"
