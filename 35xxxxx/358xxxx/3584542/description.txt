        ----------------------------- PLOT ----------------------------
        
         In February, 1945, one of the fiercest battles of the Pacific 
        theater of World War II occurs on the tiny island of Iwo Jima. 
        Thousands of Marines attack the stronghold maintained by thousands
        of Japanese, and the slaughter on both sides is horrific. Early 
        in the battle, an American flag is raised atop the high point,
        Mount Suribachi, and a photograph of the raising becomes an 
        American cause celebre. As a powerful inspiration to war-sick 
        Americans, the photo becomes a symbol of the Allied cause. The 
        three surviving flag raisers, Rene Gagnon, John Bradley, and 
        Ira Hayes, are whisked back to civilization to help raise funds 
        for the war effort. But the accolades for heroism heaped upon the
        three men are at odds with their own personal realizations that 
        thousands of real heroes lie dead on Iwo Jima, and that their 
        own contributions to the fight are only symbolic and not deserving
        of the singling out they are experiencing. Each of the three must 
        come to terms with the honors, exploitation, and grief that they 
        face simply for being in a photograph.

               noticed thats the video qualty outstanding But the audio 
               is lacking a little but is very watchable Just have your
               head phones ready for this one.
