Also, has there ever been CAL's released for SBS 2003?  Thanks "
,beaujames,2006-12-25T18:31Z,"BTW... don't do this on an existing install, repack your original iso and do a fresh install.  The advantage of corpfiles vs. antiwpa is that you CAN do windows updates (until the key is blacklisted).  this IS from the original release, however, it works on sp1 and R2.  If you've ever d/l'ed SP1 and look at the files with say winrar, none of these files were ever updated.  If you want to test this out d/l virtual PC 2007 and do a virtual install."
,3wheeler,2006-12-26T03:53Z,"Thanks for that info. Do you know if there is a crack out there for the CAL's? I understand that as installed, SBS allows only 5 connections. Thanks"
,beaujames,2006-12-26T05:02Z,"No, unfortunately not that I've found."
,beaujames,2006-12-26T05:04Z,"But, from what I've found, CAL's aren't mandatory unless you are using exchange or SQL.  I've installed several legal SBS boxes one on a network of 12 PC's and it hasn't required CAL's.   They aren't using SQL or Exhchange though."
,3wheeler,2006-12-26T06:35Z,"I now have 8 connections using exchange to SBS 2003 and no request for more licenses. I would like to add more.....maybe it's just time to bite the bullet and buy.
Remember that beautiful unlimited CAL's crack for SBS 2000? The good ole days.
Thanks for the Corp Files!"
