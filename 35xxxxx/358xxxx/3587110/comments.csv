Vista txt Guide info and Crack



Run`s stable under Vista RC2 Final x86. (some x64).

I have not used a zip proggie, because some of u only mabe need keygen`s or other info.
Maybe you only need some of the Software, not all.

Use: uTorrent @ www.utorrent.com enable DHT and select what U need.

Have a nice day :-)

,oktan,2006-12-31T22:00Z,notnoisy .... idiot? ok i didnt know you was one...but its ok!

,skyclad,2007-01-01T21:20Z,"the seeding works fine.yeahh right....There a lots of these 86% og 96%  99,9% and then it stops...why???????:)"
,ecsisbest,2007-01-02T04:19Z,"I have had many large torrents quit like you said, mostly on demonoid. Most are never seeded and they either stop or are deleted after most of it has been downloaded. Much bandwidth and time, sometimes 2 weeks is wasted on these.

On demonoid it has ruined by upload ratio. Plus the ratio isn't properly updated as I am always seeding, 24/7."
,PLCharlie,2007-01-17T20:04Z,okay. I didn't download this but I've had Vista ultimate for about 15 days.. And I gotta say that nothings really changed.. I mean - yeah some cool animated layouts which make it look more attractive.. but thats about.. unless you're a real lover of it and checked it all out. but my point.. WAIT until its out proberbly.. nottin is designed to vista and I had a lot of problems with different apps and stuff.. but my advice to those who want it to work from scratch is WAIT!!!
