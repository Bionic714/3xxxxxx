,rastabengen,2006-12-31T11:56Z,Nobody that knows where the whole show is or is it anyone who have put it up yet?
,NemligJa,2006-12-31T12:04Z,"Quality is decent - wmv. Fights are great.

But it seems the torrent doesn't work... damn.

If one of you guys wanna help, send med a PM and we will work something out."
,jimmy189,2006-12-31T13:01Z,"It isn't necessary to torrent each individual file. 

This one torrent can suffice since most clients will allow you to select which files from the torrent to download. Making multiple torrents and seeding each will only slow the process down."
,NemligJa,2006-12-31T13:03Z,"> It isn't necessary to torrent each individual file.
I know, but this torrent seemed to be broken, so I tried once more with the individual fights."
,Iceburgslim,2006-12-31T16:50Z,"Someone help him figure out what he did wrong.  It will be beneficial next time if he's the first to upload again.  

Thanks for the effort."
