I would recommend

instead"
,hentooth,2006-12-30T13:19Z,The sound files for book one on that torrent are the same size as these!!!
,made-of-technetium,2006-12-30T17:28Z,"Then how come your's only 104MB for 9 episodes while the other one is 951MB for all 26 episodes?
I personally have all 26 encoded at 128kbs total size 671MB (240MB for just first 9 episodes)"
,hentooth,2006-12-30T21:47Z,"On hard disk here, the first book came to about 5 meg more than this download.

Not dissing your download, jusy saying the book I have uploaded here is not a lot different, and if all the downloaders want is to put back the book that somehow got corrupted when I encoded all DA's work, then this is a quick download for them.

Besides, it plays clearly, and burns to disk nicely, I have done so for several friends, and have NO complaints.

,made-of-technetium,2006-12-31T00:52Z,"I've downloaded a part of each torrent & this is definitely of a noticeably lower quality.
This is 56kbit, 22050Hz compared to 160kbit, 44100Hz.

Fair enough though I suppose there must still be people out there (probably on dial-up) who are prepared to accept low quality sound. If not I would recommend The other torrent especially since this is more than just an audio book but an audio feast for the ears

ps   The other torrent has nothing to do with me, I just found it when I checked to see if there was any point in adding my copy

,hentooth,2007-01-01T00:39Z,"made-of-technetium , no probs, I'll also point out that this was NONE of my creation, the original torrent was a collection of pretty much everything the master ever did, not just HHG which I'd downloaded over the years, but the first book of HHG got corrupted, so I re seeded it by popular request.
