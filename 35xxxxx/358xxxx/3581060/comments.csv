,duvet_demon,2008-06-05T13:36Z,"Okay guys - since using it you may have discovered this anyway, but I am gonna spell it out just the same.
Been using this for a week now, and up until today I have had a reduced internet access, countless pop-ups and no end of spyware....
All is not lost however....
Today I double checked that Stopzilla was actually working, and it suddenly updated to a newer version, then updated the protection database with six update files.
The newer version looked somewhat different to the one I downloaded here, and I did a complete scan.Took about an hour.
Apart from 2 virii that AVG missed, Stop zilla found 4 files called Defender B Add/Spyware deposited in the registry by Stopzilla, and pointed it back to the original download from here.
Now everything is hunky-dorey! :)
This software is great, if you ensure that it updates as soon as you install it, and do an immediate scan to eliminate the problems associated with it.."
,Redperil,2008-06-06T21:58Z,"**DO NOT INSTALL THIS**
seriously messed up my system, devet_demon's right in what hes saying about doing an update, but after doing this and then doing another scan... finds loads of viruses relating to the original install, but when you ""fix"" it, believe me... your comps not fixed at all.  Mine took 20 mins to boot up and when it did, everythings so slow... its unusable.  When shutting down it just hanged on the ""windows is shutting down"" screen, forcing me to manually switch off.  Fortunately for me i created a restore point beforehand and used this or else would have been reformat job cos i have no patience like that.  Of course this is just my opinion but take my advice and stay well clear."
,Xeokym,2008-11-30T03:22Z,"This thing is supposedly a ""virus detector"" and ""pop up blocker,"" and it does do that, but the damn program ITSELF acts like a virus!! When I installed it, I specified that I did NOT want it to install on my toolbar nor as add-ons to IE, and yet it REPEATEDLY attempted to install itself as add-ons over and over and over again. Finally I had to remove the fucking program because I got sick of clicking ""NO"" on my Scotty Watchdog everytime it detected stopzilla trying to install itself! Stopzilla also does its own annoying pop-ups, and tries to highjack your homepage if you're not careful. 

Use it to detect & remove mal-ware, and then UNINSTALL the fucking thing or else it will drive you fucking insane!!!"
,MMARIZA,2008-12-23T08:39Z,This shit dont let you uninstall it  something about you cant access this network bullshit do not download its caca

,kira41910,2011-01-20T22:49Z,I was tired of the new popups appearing on pbay so I did a search and found this new browser called maxthon. its rated better than firefox or anything else. plus it has THE best popup blocker out there. I downloaded it and NO MORE popups. I highly recommend it.
,DannyIsPro,2011-03-30T17:45Z,"Clean. Scanned it with Panda Cloud Anti-Virus, Avast, and Norton. Came out clean. No worries guys, don't believe anyone else on if this is a virus, its COMPLETELY CLEAN. But on the flip side of this actually working, now sure."
,hgreezy,2011-05-13T01:39Z,"THIS IS A FUCKING TROJAN DON'T DOWNLOAD IT, Earny 384 is a punk bitch, Glad I have a version of mcafee that caught it before it even downloaded, fuck this guy"
,teesimmons14k,2011-07-19T05:02Z,"Its a shame.... you would have thought by now that ANY file especially those of small smallest size are warning signs of themselves a ""red flag"" as to their content.  Why in the world you use the user either download a small file or take the word of other people.. most of them are designed to entice you into downloading the fire with the STRONG possibility that they themselves ""packed with intrusionary devices"" and encourage you to download them..... RULE OF THUMB if there is a strong need to acquire a file and you can't get it from ""legitimate"" website for free, then purchase the software... at least you will be assured that it won't ""ladden"" with spyware/adware, trojans, viruses, or other items that has a main focus of of entering into your computer, act like ""Asexual"" to sneak about infecting every facid of your computer and then ""striking"" when it is at the point of rendering your computer to the point where you  will have to reformat and start over.  Creating a ""restore"" may work on some things but moving your computer ""back in time"" AFTER your system has been infected serves as a lost cause.... hey you know the attage... ""You Get What You Pay For"" so if you don't head these words of wisdom... you will have no one but YOURSELVES to blame"
