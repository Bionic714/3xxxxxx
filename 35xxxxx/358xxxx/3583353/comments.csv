,elyk1212,2006-12-24T19:21Z,"Hey, FYI, I play online without any crack from a friends burnt disc.  Seems odd....  Why would this be needed, to avoid using a banned serial number, or something?   Also, it isn't like some other providers system, There are master servers that contain the internet server hosts, but each server host is independently maintained, thus bans would only be likely at the top, master serer node.  But as I understand, these are just inquiry servers, that do not need authentication. 

Summary: This seems a little strange... hope it's not a virus."
,peachwhiteowl,2006-12-24T22:49Z,hope it really works
,Frankenfish,2006-12-25T01:06Z,Have anyone tested it? Is it OK?
,practice00,2006-12-25T02:21Z,"elyk1212,  Lemme explain. I downloaded ut2004 from a torrent... and i guess that there are quite a few users that did the same. Now.. .i tried to play online... but the game automatically connected to a master server even before my list of unreal servers would be updated. The server detected that it was a cracked copy and forbid me to see that list of servers. I have spent some time searching for this crack not to mention the more-than-underground sites that i had to visit. Finally i found it and tested it on my own unreal. It works. and taking into account that is not so easy to find... i chose to help everybody not to go though the same ordeal. It's not my crack, i haven't made it or add any modification to it. For viruses i tested it with nod32 v2.5 and for spyware i tested my system with spybot s&d. 

Summary. it's not a virus, and if you don't need it .. then DON'T download it. If you can't play online... then this should help you."

,menvafanda,2007-01-10T19:00Z,"thx, so u only need to install the patch and paste the crack files to the system folder, nothing more when u start the game or something?"

,That_GuyVIIX,2007-03-10T02:31Z,doesn't work.... ignore this garbage
,Amandax22,2007-03-22T07:47Z,"To get it working, find your Unreal Tournament 2004 directory (I don't know the exact location.) and find the .exe. Replace that with your new one."
,sniffysniper,2007-03-28T12:29Z,ty
,Hednoize,2007-05-03T06:03Z,"I used this. I was only able to see a small amount of servers, mostly demo maps if not solely. I used the deviance full game. This crack doesnt seem very good.."

,Reconunit415,2008-05-07T02:05Z,"Good crack, works. Couldn't find anywhere else even at GameCopyWorld because it is down at the moment.
I'm going to seed, thanks."
,OnyxgrinD,2008-06-26T08:00Z,1.4 mb? lmao please this has got to be garbage. The normal install is over 5 cd's.
,sterbik,2008-07-01T17:06Z,"OnyxgrinD:

You stupid. This is just the crack file. it's NOT a garbage."
,freecoolph,2008-08-11T11:26Z,"actually i dont think ut04 need a crack to join multiplayer. yes, it automatically connects to the master server and check for cd key, and kick you out from a multiplayer game if it thinks the cd key is invalid. then let us skip its checking :P
go to ut2004\system and find unreal2004.ini and search for ""[IpDrv.MasterServerUplink]""
then set all items under that as false.
save the ini and it should work nicely =]"
,Asmodien,2008-08-15T22:33Z,how do you set it to false?
,fanofgam3s,2008-12-04T17:37Z,hey zseed it maan!
,fanofgam3s,2008-12-04T17:41Z,and can someone plz tell how to install/use crack
,practice00,2009-01-05T19:43Z,"there is a file contained in the archive (ind.nfo) that describes in a few steps how this crack is installed. Please note that you'll need to open ind.nfo with notepad or a similar text editor in order to see its contents (double clicking on it will just popup an error message). Anyway I'll just  paste the contents of the file here to make it easier for everyone:

1 Unrar
2 Download and install v3369 update from the web (http://www.fileplanet.com/files/140000/140688.shtml)
3 Copy Engine.dll and IpDrv.dll to /ut2004/system
4 Play"
,kvrga88,2009-11-10T21:55Z,Works great!!! thx
,mufuti9,2009-11-28T09:59Z,"i believe with this patch you will be able to ONLY join servers that are ALSO using this patch.

At elast that is what the readme of the original patch on gamecopyworld says. Sadly there is no patch for public servers, not for v3369 at least.

So if you want to play this game on real servers - no way other than buying it..."
,Sabonum,2010-01-28T15:53Z,Thanks. Greatly working! :)
,-sl-,2010-08-28T17:36Z,"Why won't the invasion servers load?

,mirage3,2010-10-10T12:05Z,thanks
,Arnuxs,2010-11-16T22:02Z,It finds only demo servers... Better than just single player... But I would like to play in all servers...
,Captain47,2011-03-19T16:47Z,"Worked for me on Win 7 64, great upload~"
,scytheh,2011-06-09T17:32Z,This crack worked for me for a week. Now I can't connect anymore. It says there's a problem when connecting to master server. Tried changing the key and re installing this crack with no success.
,Gassaroth,2012-02-19T05:47Z,Thank you man!
