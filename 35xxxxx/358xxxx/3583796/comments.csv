,didoucebu,2006-12-26T08:48Z,"Works fine, It does not properly activate, but gives you an unlimited 30 days trial period.
I changed the time to 2009 and it's fine."

,Idolsys,2006-12-26T19:55Z,"This is a repack of a crack released on a Russian site a week ago. There it was called WinVICrack. It appears to function as posted even on the MS proclaimed ""FrankenBuild"".

If this can actually stop the MS check in I'm not sure as of yet, would be really cool if it does."

,SestoUniverse,2009-01-19T06:13Z,"holy shit, it actually worked!
i had just reached 30 days and used this patch at 11:30pm and it read 21600 minutes(15 days). When 12:05 came around, it still read 21600minutes(15 days) lol.
simply follow these instructions :http://keznews.com/1951_Permanently_Activate_Windows_Vista_by_Skip_Activation_with_Patched_TimerStop_sys_Crack
and get this torrent and it should work fine.
thanks!"
