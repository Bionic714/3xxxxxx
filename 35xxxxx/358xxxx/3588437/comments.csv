,freebsdhost,2007-06-20T14:57Z,"If you're using a PC, get a copy of Nero 7 Reloaded.  Use ""Nero Vision"" to encode the DivX file to a DVD image and burn it to a DVD disc.
Make sure you select the correct encoding in the 'options' (PAL or NTSC).  As this DivX was created from a PAL dvd, it will default to PAL.  Converting it to NTSC will take longer!"
