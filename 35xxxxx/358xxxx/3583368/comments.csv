,cossie paul,2007-02-05T01:58Z,no picture just sound ?
,appledot121,2007-04-03T23:15Z,"Hey, the quality is great, but what's with the sound, you can barely hear two characters talking to each other or talking by themselves.

If someone knows the problem, please comment or send me a message or something. Thank you! "
,bebe90,2007-04-15T12:16Z,Those of you that have probs with the sound.. check that you have the newest version of vlc.. 
,cyberham,2007-05-20T05:44Z,"It's quick time. You can download Itunes with quick time (very not recommended) or if you want to play it everywhere (e.g. SubEdit...) then download Quick Time Alternative (very recommended). 

Thx Phrax!"

CoreAVC is MUCH better than FFDshow for decoding H.264 video..."
,ViperXxx,2007-09-02T12:41Z,"you fucking idiot, done it in mp4! fucking retard noob"
,forayer,2007-09-15T01:16Z,h264 is so much better than divx (or xvid or clones). nice work mate.
,Ivo_Urrutia,2007-09-26T20:25Z,"Una reverenda mierda !!
Solo te va a servir para verla en el pc. Si la quieres ver en el dvdplayer vas a tener que sudar sangre ;-)

,Shwanger,2008-01-23T13:17Z,"Possibly the best sound and vid quality I've seen.

Prob is, I can only play it on Media Player Classic (Windows Media Player Unicode version 6.4).

...and to the guy who says there's no sound,. PLUG YER DAMN SPEAKERS IN, DUMBASS.  Period..dotdotone"

,Huskieu,2008-06-03T16:54Z,"I assume the VLC will play that as it plays everything. Nevertheless, what's the point in making a torrent in format that is not well recognised? Moreover, it would be easy just to mention that in description. Media market is real minefield! Thank God for VLC :D"
,GeorgePowell,2008-06-10T15:39Z,"why not AVI?

when your ripping it, is just as easy to make it AVI... besides, it is just standard to have movies in AVI, why do anything different? its just awekward for people. download this, its just as fast, but no shitty file extensions:

http://thepiratebay.org/tor/4025998/Batman_Begins_avi"
,SyluxReaper,2008-06-29T07:29Z,"Great quality for a 700 mb file, thanks a lot
and just use the latest version of VLC to play

looking forward to seeing the Dark Knight in theaters next weekend!"
,SyluxReaper,2008-06-29T07:30Z,and the reason he didn't use avi is this has a much higher quality..does downloading one program (which is smart to have anyway) take that much effort?
,Arksun,2008-07-03T13:15Z,"Good picture quality, but there IS a problem with the sound, its rather off-center to the left side. Especially dialogue, which is a real shame.

One can adjust the panning in the player or soundcard mixer to try and compensate but then it skews the other sound effects and music.

Tested in latest VLC player, WMP etc etc. I'm amazed no-one else spotted this flaw!"
,Arksun,2008-07-03T13:27Z,"ok ignore last comment, it seems my VLC wasn't quite up to latest version as I had thought, oops. lol.  That DID make a difference to the centering of the audio stream.  Lesson learnt, always ensure your VLC is fully updated to get the best picture/sound quality... and erm, dont post comments before doing so  *egg on face*"
,Slackore,2008-07-06T01:36Z,"Well, one reason could be the program he is using either suggests or forces you to make MP4's"
,miknos,2008-07-08T23:44Z,"GeorgePowell,

 The file is not AVI because it's a different format. It's not Divx. It's H.264 (as the title says). It's the new standard for blu-ray discs. H.264 is better than Divx comparing the same bitrate. Probably this is the best quality you can get in a 700MB. Even though, the movie has 140min, so I'll search for a +1GB DVDrip at least."

,miknos,2008-07-20T19:10Z,Downloaded this version and Klaxxon (which is double the size). I must say I got impressed by phrax quality. Both look just like the same and Klaxxon removed the credits at end (so phrax has like 10min more vid). H264 rocks! Hope all releasers start using it.

and for all you nubs who complain it for being MP4 or cant play it, it isnt MP4, its a Blu-ray format called H.264 which delivers the best sound and video peformance for a compressed file format, and to play it just go to www.videolan.org and get the newest VLC-player, can play all file types with no problems, so dont complain for something great you get for free"

will it work with MPlayerX for Mac??? thnx"
,michaelrwatson,2012-02-11T23:50Z,"@h11s, drziakhan: i too think Dark Knight is better, but this is a very good movie, and un-Batman-like, which is cool.

And Phrax, THANKS FOR MAKING THIS .MP4 which is much better than mkv."
,michaelrwatson,2012-02-14T09:44Z,"OMG, i take that back. Batman Begins is every bit as good as T.D.K. And this is a *sweet* rip. Best quality i've seen in 700MB. I think 5:1 24KHz audio is a good idea--more data for the videostream, and no one but a music teacher can tell the diff betw 24 and 48KHz anyway. Clearly there is no reason for a 1.4GB rip anymore unless you're watching on a 50"" HDTV.

Is this a two-pass encode? Should be if you're going to go to the trouble of making quality rips. Thx. "
,Kalabrate,2012-02-24T08:52Z,Well done buddy.
,AtariMeow,2012-03-15T14:38Z,"This plays fine in my computer using VLC. However I download movies to watch from a harddrive plugged into my TV and when I try to do so with this file, the only sound I get is an extremely loud, constant clicking. In short, 
using VLC: V:10 A:10. 
using TV: V:10 A:Big Fat Zero."
,wee-bay,2012-06-14T06:01Z,"yo much appreciation to the uploader but some problems...

quality 8.5/10

audio is just bad.  3/10 tops.
