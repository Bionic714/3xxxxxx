,Masterpoolcat,2007-01-03T03:31Z,"Hey! Thanks for this Rezzixcountry!!! I'm curious why you decided to make the first vid ""Ab Ripper"" an avi file and not an mpeg like the rest? Any chance you can upload the fitness guide and the nutrition plan? Thanks again for this great upload!"

,Pirate_Josh,2007-04-20T03:28Z,"hey guys, if you want to download fast, download the other sections/parts as well as the 7 gig file and then replace the completed sections with the incomplete files of the 7 gig files this way you will be half way done and faster download.

ex: download the leg_shoulder, chest_arms, biceps_back  whatever that available individually.  after finish just move to the download folder where your 7 gigs files are and replace the incomplete"
,daddy86,2007-05-03T02:58Z,So far it is downloading great...does anyone know the order that you are supposed to do these workouts?

,lepsog,2007-09-12T15:27Z,"I finally got it all downloaded and it took about a week. I highly recommend using BitTorrent to do this. All the videos played fine with Windows Media Player except for 1 (I can?t remember) but it played fine with QuickTime. To burn these as DVDs, download the Latest Nero with Vision 4. Here is a how to guide: http://www.dvd-guides.com/content/view/125/59/"
,trinitee,2007-11-03T20:24Z,"I have been tryin to download it but in Bit Torrent all it says is that it's ""connecting to tracker, waiting for response"" and it never starts
what should I do?"
,flappyboris,2007-11-17T09:17Z,"Thanks Rezz for this torrent. Kind of ironic that I bought this w/ a friend & he went out of town with it...so...lucky me for torrents!

Anyways thought I'd add my two cents: You can substantially decrease the filesize of these videos after download by converting to MP4 using the H.264 container and a little tweaking w/ the compression rates. Nero 8 Recode did this well (when Recode analyzes the video it may appear to freeze, but just keep waiting...it didn't freeze)."
,absolutezero2382,2007-11-21T19:21Z,Does any one have the 3 phase nutrition plan? I would really appreciate it. And thanks so much for the download!

--Ab Ripper X in AVI format -  not able to play (only sound). HOWEVER: ""Ab Ripper X"" included after all strength workouts as the P90X plan advises to do  (as in no need to stop, search and play)-- VERY NICE compitalion. 

 --""Shoulder & Arms"" and ""Cardio X"" missing. .. But definitely not worth complaining. WIll look elsewhere for these two.
