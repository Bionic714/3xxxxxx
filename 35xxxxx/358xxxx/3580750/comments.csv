Je travaille sur des sous-titres en franĂ§ais pour ce film, Ă  date j'ai traduit tout le CD1. La sortie des sous-titres se fera dans 2 ou 3 jours."
,Heero14,2007-01-05T02:50Z,"Subtitles in SRT format are now available here: http://gabest.dyndns.org/subm/

Also, I have uploaded French subtitles on that same website. Enjoy."

,Heero14,2007-08-19T07:13Z,"In October, my internet bandwith will become limited, so I won't be able to uplaod anymore. It's very frustrating, nothing I can do about it. Because of that, I will try to seed as much as I can until October arrives. Get it while you still can!"
