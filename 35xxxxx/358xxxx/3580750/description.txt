Story:

Sugihara (Kubozuwa Yousuke) meets a Japanese girl, Sakurai (Kou Shibasaki), at a party. He blunderingly starts to date her and gradually feels drawn to each other. Sakurai becomes the first girlfriend he has ever had. Sugihara has not told her that he is a Korean. With a peculiar background, he is in agony wether to tell her or not, for his confession might ruin their relationship. Sugihara was born and raised in Japan and schooled at a Korean school in Japan. His father, a former professional boxer, hammered boxing into Sugihara since childhood. So far, Sugihara got the best of 24 fights and thanks to dad, he becomes strong-willed. One night, Jong-il, Sugihara's best friend, calls and says: I've something to tell you. It's awesome and I think you'll understand. This is the beginning of his future destiny because the peculiar identity will no longer be the unbeatable obstacle to him...
