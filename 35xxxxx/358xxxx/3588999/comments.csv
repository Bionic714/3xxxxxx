,LJE111,2012-08-12T12:42Z,"Good quality: V: 8 A: 8 There are a couple of glitches early on where the film pixilates for a few seconds, and the sound is slightly out of sinc - but only in the beginning of the movie, and it might have been a problem specific to my DL. (Someone seeding might have an incomplete version - have had this happen before.) But I'm not going to bother re-downloading... it's so good I'm going to buy it.

This is one of the best documentaries on crop circles I've seen... I decided to purchase the DVD from amazon to support the filmmaker and because I want to see the ""extras"" which the reviewers  on Amazon say are as good as the movie.

 FYI: I found a 2-disc set that was just released by UFOTV. It costs a little more but I figured the extra DVD might be worth it.

Thanks again Ikobesak -- will check out your other uploads!"
