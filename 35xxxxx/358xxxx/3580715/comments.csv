[V],mondo,2006-12-21T10:41Z,"No, but then itÂ´s called DVD-R.. This is an DVD-RIP, but in the DVD-R category.. 
Wrong category that is....."
,amac13,2006-12-24T06:21Z,It's funny watching all these losers squirm over someone putting something in the wrong category...get a fuckin life!
,Wetbones,2006-12-28T11:53Z,"So how is the quality of this DVD rip? Is it even a DVD rip or just the same unwatchable cam version? If it is from the actual DVD, was it taken from the R rated or from the UNRATED release?"
,GR3NAD3,2007-01-16T18:26Z,its a scanner not a screener
,Dartemis,2007-03-02T11:38Z,it's okay quality.. the whole movie is a little dark/yellow :/ but you can watch it anyway if it dosen't bother u..?
