,drumz0rz,2009-04-29T06:41Z,"This is a great movie. If you've never heard/seen it, get it now. Quality's really good too."
,SamuelRiv,2009-07-11T20:59Z,"Subs hardcoded, low resolution for the file size, no rip information given. Recommend ECHiZEN or DC instead."
,meowers,2009-07-14T13:01Z,Good movie. But I highly suggest going out and getting the book. This movie doesn't do it much justice; much is left out from the book. Battle Royale is definitely one of my favorite books of all time. 
,kunoichi15,2009-09-18T14:20Z,"please seeeeeeeeeeeeeed, I will as soon as I dl it. "

,hanahana-deruka,2011-07-08T00:09Z,"Im confused about the story line
when they showed the girl covered in blood in the beginning,
was that the last battle royal
or a skip to the ending???"

that was the ending of the last battle royal."
,B.Torrents,2012-08-04T21:55Z,Thanks...
,subliminalz,2012-08-19T22:27Z,Poor video and shaky subs. 
,subliminalz,2012-08-19T22:28Z,"hanahana-deruka: they included English subs in this, so I am not clear on why you failed to read them. That was the girl who won the previous ""game"" and the reporter was commenting on the fact that the girl was smiling. Learn to read, bro."
,himynameisshu,2012-08-24T05:06Z,"all useless comments, go on a site that rates and explains movies, comments are ment to tell others HOW GOOD THE TORRENT IS. Kthx (make an adjustment)"
