Blazing fast DVD to Nokia transfers. Put a movie on your cellphone in less than 40 minutes. Enjoy tv-series, home movies, and even feature films on your Nokia mobile phone and watch them in great quality, in full screen landscape mode.

A memorycard as small as 128 Mb is enough to store a full length feature film, or up to a hundred minutes of other content. Take your video's and movies on the plane, train or automobile, watch them on vacation, at work or at school. With only two clicks, this PC software converts the content of any video file (AVI, MPEG, Youtube, etc.), from any drive (harddisk, CD, DVD, removable) to a super small movie, which will play on any Nokia device, from a postage stamp size memory card. You can use a headset or the built-in speaker to listen to the sound. Subtitled and foreign language DVDs are also supported.

The following 43 Nokia phones are supported: NOKIA 3230, 3250, 3600, 3650, 3660, 5500, 230, 6230i, 6233, 6235, 6260, 6270, 6280, 6600, 6620, 6630, 6638, 6670, 6680, 6681, 6682, 7610, 770, 7710, 9300/9300i, 9500, E50, E60, E61, E70, N70, N71, N72, N73, N75, N80, N90, N91, N92, N93, N95, N-Gage/QD
