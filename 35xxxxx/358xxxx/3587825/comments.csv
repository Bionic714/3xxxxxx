,aliast,2007-01-02T01:07Z,I'm wondring if it will work on my inspiron 1100
,Smackturd,2007-01-02T02:37Z,"Yes it will work with any dell units, it checks to see if the mainboard is a branded dell and installs, I will post the Dell XP PRO W/SP2 that I own, that you can use the same way, when installing on a dell Mainboard laptop, or desk top, you will not need to enter cd keys, or anything, it activates, and will pass genuine activation.  all I need tofigure out is how to make, and upload a torrent. 

Pick up an old dell mainboard from ebay, keep a Dell XP cd handy, and you have a great cheap sysytem.

Any advise on were to read up on making and uploading torrents"
