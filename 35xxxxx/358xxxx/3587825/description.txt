Here's a mirror of the Dell Windows XP Home Edition SP2 Reinstallation CD that came with my laptop.  If you loose this CD, you're completely hosed as far as your legit license.  So don't pay that Microsoft tax twice!

This CD should work on Dell Inspiron 9200 and 9300 at the very least, and probably any other with an OEM WinXP SP2 Home license sticker on the bottom.

THIS CD WILL NOT WORK FOR NON-DELL COMPUTERS.

THIS IS NOT A GENERIC OEM WINDOWS CD.

DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS CD IF YOU DO NOT HAVE A DELL LAPTOP ('cause it'll be worthless.)

Cheers!
