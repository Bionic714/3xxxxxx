Kan man få tag på CS3 på svenska ?"
,QuZack,2006-12-28T11:37Z,"Vet ej, men tror inte denna fungerar till svenska endå (:"
,Pyssel,2007-01-02T16:38Z,Men hallå! CS3 finns ju inte som något annat än publik beta ännu! Vad är skulle det här cracket åstadkomma?
,QuZack,2007-01-03T02:06Z,Det tar bort prövetiden som är på två dagar. D.v.s. registerar photoshop.
,Neglo,2007-01-04T10:39Z,Asså vad menar du med kopiera dit den som finns i zap???
,Neglo,2007-01-04T10:39Z,zip*
,kicker259,2007-01-04T17:38Z,er det noen som har crack til CS3 til Windows??
,QuZack,2007-01-05T17:13Z,"Neglo, det finns en fil i zip filen som heter Adobe Photoshop CS3.app, den ska du kopiera in i Photoshop mappen som ligger under program/"

,terminus-,2007-01-08T05:12Z,"@andy721:
They can speak whatever language they want, considering swedish is the native language of the pirate bay. Maybe you should get off your self-centred american ass and realize things don't revolve around you"
,beline,2007-01-08T07:20Z,"ok, so swedish, whatever, the question is, does it work?  and how? "
,Spongeh,2007-01-09T14:53Z,"Yes it works, just how its described ;)

1) Delete or backup Adobe Photoshop CS3.app in /Applications/Adobe Photoshop CS3/
2) Copy Adobe Photoshop CS3.app from the zip file
3) Start CS3!"
,MattDemon,2007-01-10T03:15Z,"I love Swedish people!

So this works?"
,xmountain,2007-01-12T06:13Z,"Here is how to crack Photoshop CS3 and get rid of the trial period:
1) Complete the installation as usual.
2) Go to the installation folder \Adobe\Adobe Photoshop CS3\AMT
3) Rename the file called application.sif to something else, like application.sif_

that's it .. xm"
,Sjogras,2007-01-15T20:23Z,"whats different with cs3 from cs2? got cs2 9.0 now.

ni kan svara på svenska:)"
,typat,2007-01-19T10:37Z,"CS 3.0 supports Intel Macs, while 2.0 doesn't

Its emulated=slower"
,majorawol,2007-01-25T17:34Z,"Fatal Error -- Missing components.

Doesn't work on this bran new mac"
,Spongeh,2007-01-29T17:03Z,"xmountain: to start with thats the wrong path for Mac. You have to view package contents for the Adobe Photoshop CS3.app file then look in Contents/Resources/AMT for the application.sif file.

also I used that for a short time before it stopped working. So I came along and found this. This crack is far more reliable than fupping with the application.sif file.

majorawol: gotta ask you downloaded the CS3 installer and installed Photoshop? Otherwise I dunno what it could be missing. Though I do get messages about components which PS wouldn't load but they are just the PPC bits."
,Seaman Staynes,2007-01-31T18:42Z,where do i find the Adobe Photoshop CS3.app file?
,johnw100,2007-02-03T13:14Z,"terminus, so english is only spoken in america ( i assume you mean north america)? You arrogant twat. P.S is arse, not ass. Ass is a donkey you fuckwit"
,majorawol,2007-02-06T22:00Z,"Spongeh: All I downloaded was: Adobe Photoshop CS3.zip

Am I missing something? The prg loads, it just gives me fatal errors"
,h4rl3qu1n,2007-02-07T03:13Z,"@ majorawol

Yes, you are missing something. Start by downloading the application first man, this is just the 'crack'."
,ofeig,2007-02-08T12:29Z,"""P.S is arse, not ass. ""
I thought ""P.S."" was Postum Scriptum?"
,redticket,2007-02-28T23:08Z,"hi. i just downloaded and installed photoshop CS3 from adobe website. i have also downloaded this crack...
then, when i open the zip file, it unzips then a file photoshop cs3 application goes to the root folder.

i copied the file to the applications/photoshop cs3 folder

i run the program and it has no more trial perio warning. but it says something about missing plug-ins?

how to fix this? 

thanks."
,stapler101,2007-03-02T20:02Z,"

I am new so please accept my thanks and answer a question. How can I know if the crack worked??
thanks again."
,BigFuzzy,2007-03-06T17:12Z,"Just FYI, after a while (not sure how long) the program stopped loading up for me. I think it's some sort of workaround to this crack. Wouldn't load at all. 
If this happens to you, don't lose faith, i got it to work again. 
I simply renamed the application.sif back to it's original name (ie ""application.sif"") and tried starting CS3.
It will then say something about the trial period being over. 
I then go in and rename the ""application.sif"" to something else (I use application.xxxsif) and loaded it back up and it works fine. 
I hope that helps anyone who may have the same problem. 

PS Terminus -  I resent your generalizing. I'm an American who speaks 6 languages who knows much about the world at large and isn't self-centered whereas your comment makes you look as bad as the many self-centered Americans you're complainging about.

You and Andy both should try it. "

,rubberkeith,2007-04-16T18:45Z,Are there any major changes between the BETA and the official release?
,karandasj,2007-05-21T13:15Z,"the download of the CS3.zip stays stuck at 99,8% ... argh, what do I have to do to get the file completely?
thx!"
,AnalogSplender,2007-09-29T23:28Z,"I unzipped this to my mac and as far as I know I didn't have to install it.  I opened it up and a ""Fatal error - missing component"" came up and the component was ""/Library/Application Support/Adobe/Adobe Version Cue CS3/3.0.0/Version Cue.Framework"".  I clicked OK. Then something else came up and said ""One or more files in the Adobe Application Support folder, necessary for running Photoshop, are missing.  Please run the Photoshop installer and re-install Photoshop."" I don't know what to do because it won't let me open anything up, making the whole thing useless.  Someone please help figure out what I need to do!"
,yorkandy,2008-01-26T18:02Z,Hi.....I now have 2 working apps........one beta and one (time limited) trial.........is there another step I missed?....thanks :)
,Kingtiger88,2008-02-11T12:15Z,"Hi!

Is there someone that have a SWEDISH PHOTOSHOP CS3 for Mac OS X??

Have looked a long time for the Swedish cracked version.

Thanks! / Tackar!

,1wille1,2008-02-14T21:54Z,Is this only the crack??
,hhelliesen,2008-03-13T08:20Z,Tjänare! Hur fungerar dette med patcher och lignande? Denna .sif filen finnar jäg inte pä min MAC.
,imru2b12,2008-03-22T19:22Z,"is this cs3 ""Extended""? I already have the entire suite installed in my system. But i'm trying to run a photoshop web building plugin called, ""Sitegrinder 2"". My problem is: sitegrinder requires Photoshop to have a registered serial number (even though it doesn't have to be legit). In photoshop, when you  go to help>system info, there should be some written text in the window that pops up. My version has nothing in it. If anyone knows where i can get Adobe Photoshop CS3 extended, where that has some sort of registration info in that box, then please let me know. I will pay you if you can help me. my email (@ is replaced with ""at"" to prevent spam): needfornameatcomcast.net"
,reznorfan15,2008-04-11T22:34Z,This program worked great for me. Loaded in 5 minutes and is running fast. thanks!
,derekc06,2008-06-05T20:00Z,worked perfect so far... thank you sweden
,fellfromdsky,2008-07-02T00:52Z,"worked fine, the zip converted right into CS3 the app.

however, this doesn't have all the presets and settings/content from adobe...
it gets you the app. and you can work with it, but it doesn't have things such as the different brushes and or presets for some effects

worked perfectly though

*working crack*
(no serial needed either)"
,luxreign,2008-10-28T21:26Z,"thanks!
at first it said fatal error, but it works fine now.
