,JJJBBB,2006-12-22T21:28Z,"It's tru Jen, if u been here a while you will know these loosers are only here to f*ck with people. Check around, search files posted by any of them, always a virus."

scanners of all sorts often do not catch viruses in installer packages prior to installing.
once installed, u must update the scanner, completely disconnect from the internet, then scan...in some cases, u must reboot into safe mode as well...before u can detect some viruses/trojans.
disconnecting and/or safe mode scanning are often the ONLY way to detect some types of trojans.
myself, i use avg from safe mode...and it detected nasties in every single file of from these guys i've ever tried.
AND, this is the second time in a week that 'AnyDVD 7' has appeared on thise site..and as now, it was a trojan source.
the companies producing software has been deliberately seeding fakes and trojan laden files for some time now, as a way of combatting piracy.

be warned, dear lady, that the enemy IS here and seeding stuff intended to discourage us from dl'ing ANY appz."
