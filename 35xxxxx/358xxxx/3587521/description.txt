Notes:
Put the Parasite Eve-folder in your /PSP/GAME-folder and launch it
from the Memory Stick in the Game menu (XMB).
It has custom made icons and it's own save folder.

DiscFiX PROPER:
The original game is two discs in size, and the game doesn't allow
players to save before disc-change, hence a problem arised on the PSP.
This release fixes that issue because the two CD's has been merged
into one.
Credit goes to psychospacefish for his work on this fix.
