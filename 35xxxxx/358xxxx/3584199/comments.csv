[T],Darkydark,2007-07-09T16:12Z,"wæææææ   stuck @ 99,1% for a looooooong time now.    protagonista  plz plz plz plz  seed"
,Kamelen_I_Dr_Snuggles,2007-08-01T16:55Z,"Darkydark, I've also been stuck at 99,1% since 24/6 and have now given up.

I don't think it's likely that anyone with 100% will seed sometimes soon so I have done a small workaround to get the DVD to work (with minimum errors) .

I've extracted the files from the ISO (with ISOBuster) and then burned them to a new DVD in Nero.
I have watched the whole DVD with the english menu and swedish subtitles and have only seen a minimum of errors (there might be other errors with other languages, I haven't checked)...

The sitter - No errors
No day at the beach - Errors at 10:18-10:21, 11:16-11:21, 17:10-17:13
One for the road - No errors
Gather ye acorns - No errors
Boo! - No errors
Dorothy and Ben - No errors

The DVD-player continues through the errors without any trouble, the picture freezes for a few seconds."
,adventurejunky,2007-10-21T01:38Z,"omg man me too 99.1% but im not giving up ill give it a week or 2 more maybe ther`s a seeder out there who forgot his pc.if that doesent work, hey great idea!"
,adventurejunky,2007-10-21T01:45Z,"damb leeching fucks,if you see a torrent that has only one seed the least you can do is wait till someone else can take over."
