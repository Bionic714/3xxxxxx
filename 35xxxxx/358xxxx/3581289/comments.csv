[V],Ludor,2006-12-22T17:06Z,"Wow. Great work, dude!"
,McGrupp2000,2006-12-25T02:58Z,"I don't believe you will see an official dvd of this. It was originaly ""filmed"" on video in the days when video was still something new. The original tapes were destroyed so there is no original master to use. 

It was released on laser disk but I haven't seen it so I can't vouch for its quality."
[V],josephus,2006-12-25T10:08Z,"Man I'm impresssed by the work you've done, thanx for the upload, I really like old Zappa music. I think he went way too commercial after sheik yerbouti, but this i Zappa at his peak. Thanx again. "
,your dear mother,2006-12-28T04:26Z,"i'm new to this.  what do I do, just burn this to a dvd-r and then watch in in my dvd player?"
[V],Pijano,2006-12-29T11:57Z,"Your dear mother:
Yes! Just burn it for example with Nero burning rom to a dvd-r disc. Watch and enjoy in your dvd-player."

,SK234269,2007-04-22T19:48Z,Help!  There's two of us stuck at 48% . . . can some kind person please please please seed?
,SK234269,2007-04-23T10:21Z,"Oh, wow.  I just realized I was trying to download a different torrent.  I have since quit that one, and started this one -- its health is MUCH better!  I also humbly apologize for my begging, as well as the proxy accusation of McGrupp not keeping it seeded.  :)  I hope you all can forgive me (and my promise still stands to keep this seed going!)"
