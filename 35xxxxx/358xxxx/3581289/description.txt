Why hasn\'t this ever been released on DVD? I wondered that myself! So I took it upon myself to fill this gap and you sse the results here. This is ripped from a commercial VHS tape and then I synched the parts of the OST (thanks Wazoo!) that matched the film\'s soundtrack. I kept everything at highest quality possible and I must admit everything came out better than I expected.

Linage:

Commercial VHS cassette MGM/UA M200423 > (video) Hauppage WinTV composite in (audio) Creative Audidgy 2 in @ 48kHz 16 > Sony Vegas 6.0 capture utility > .avi file, highest bitrate > Vegas 6.0 for editing and audio synch > DVD Architect 3.0 > DVD Files.

This was previously seeded at Pedro\'s.

Notes:

This DVD is comprised from 2 sources; first the commercially released VHS and the original soundtrack that was released by Rhino. It is interesting to note that the soundtrack does not contain everything that was on the film and vice versa. Mystery Roach is the most notable example as the version is different in the film than that on the OST. Also some songs that are complete on the OST are only partialy used in the film. I tried to match up what I could.
