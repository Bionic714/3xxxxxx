,DadoBong,2007-01-04T11:52Z,"Paranoid eh?

Now how would you call a person, let's call the person ""DigimonSlobDABob from the UK"", who thinks that any moment anywhere a ""jihadi"" is just waiting to kill his digimon-ass?
And because of this, he demands, full of hatred generated by his paranoia, that everybody has to be watched, listened to and even more.
And all that is just done to give him a feeling of being protected from the ""Jihadi"", lol.


I call that person a nutjob. Lock him away and give him some electroshock-therapy. Or some nice pills, so he'll stop bothering the rest of the world with his fantasies(paranoia).

Hey Bob&Co., are you just a kid which is affraid of the bogeyman?
Bzzz bzzzz BZZZZZZZZZZZZZ...done.

If fires can bring down a building like that, then why do demolition experts spend years learning the trade, weeks preparing for a single job,  when all they need to do is set a few fires and voila- the building falls perfectly into its own footprint."

,organeer,2008-03-28T03:33Z,"HAHAHA...HAHAHA...I keep hearing all these Conspiracy theories...Let me see!...we've had the ""No Plane Theory""...""The Saddam Hussein""...The Elvis Theory (don't ask!) But the best by far..the one that cracks me up every time..the one that is such an insult to everyone,s intelligence (and i must say to everyone that believed it....you need to stop licking the boogers of bus windows ) the one that even Dr Bernardo's reject kids laughed at is the ""OSAMA BINLADEN THEORY"" HAHA..HAHA
The people that believe in The official theory need only to start researching the FACTS and slowly but surly you will start to see a very similar pattern emerging within the US history, Question everything you read hear and see, take nobodies word as Gospel...Or you can bury your head up your ass(if you find this head up your ass position difficult to achieve..I'm sure BOBDASLOB will gladly show you how its done seeing as it comes naturally to him (ain't he a fucking inbred bush believing butt nugget) And before BOBDABITCH offers hiss 2 cents worth...try this for size...Who would you say is America's most wanted?...could it be Bin laden? you would think so wouldn't you...well go to the FBI,ss most wanted site and have a look for Bin laden and see what he's accused of ..THEN ASK YOURSELF ...WHAT THE FUCKS GOING ON"
