,Mazero,2006-12-26T17:56Z,You have to hexedit popstation.exe
,Mazero,2006-12-26T17:59Z,"Just so noone gets confused, this is the NTSC-U version of the game, just PAL cover artwork."
,Ompet,2007-01-30T20:13Z,Can someone tell me how to hexedit popstation(or what it means!)
,Runiko,2007-03-26T20:58Z,"Suikoden II doesn't play past the first boss with any ISO, and won't until PopStation is updated by Sony. There is nothing you can do about it, as far as I know. Though, if there IS a fix hiding out there in cyberspace, I'd love to hear about it."
,ace90099,2007-07-25T14:48Z,search psp-hacks.com they have a way to fix the game so you can play all the way through but it has a few steps to it
,fyhn,2008-02-16T21:01Z,"please could someone tell me how to get past the firs boss, it crashes every time"
,spiralarchitect,2008-03-08T11:34Z,"This is the solution for the PSX emulator, but it's worth trying on the PSP as well..so..

To get past the bug of the first boss, and any possible bugs later in the game, do this:

Make a shortcut of your PSPemulator
Edit the shortcut(right click-properties)
And on the ""target window"" add a space and -r to the end of the path

This will bypass the FMV that loads at the start of the Boss battles that crashes the game.
