Synopsis: In this supernatural thriller, Kathy (Andie MacDowell) is still coming to terms with the death of her husband, Jeremy (Tim Roth), several years after his passing, though the event filled her with mixed feelings -- while she was devastated by his death, he was also an alcoholic with an uncertain temper, and she hardly misses the violence he brought into her life. Wanting to bring in some extra money, Kathy decides to rent out a room in her house to a boarder. Her new tenant is a handsome engineer from France (Samuel Le Bihan), and she soon finds herself deeply infatuated with him. However, while Kathy may be a widow, she finds that Jeremy's spirit still walks the halls of their home, and he's been sent into a jealous rage by Kathy's new romance.
