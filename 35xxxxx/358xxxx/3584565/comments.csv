We're currently at 55% 22 hours into the torrent. So we should be seeing finished ppl in another 18 hours."
,Glenn74,2006-12-28T01:50Z,"Why are the 3 DVDs not split up into separate files, so one can get one or two DVDs only? I have a slow connection, so all savings count :-)   Not complaining, this was meant as constructive critisism. Thanks for putting the series here."
,NezzoX,2006-12-28T03:42Z,"Well Glenn74. It is a mini series... so it would be really boring to see just one dvd, cuz they are all connected. That is why I didnt split them.

Didnt think anyone would care eighter. :P

Happy new year."
,NezzoX,2006-12-28T03:46Z,"Dear mr limeburn. Winrar... I mean... it should be common knowledge by this time. And yes, inside the rar files there would be three iso files... that you would have to burn.

Hope you like it...

Winrar btw: http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm"
,NezzoX,2006-12-28T03:47Z,"Previous comment was meant for hernesnissen, not limeburn, who btw seems like a smart person.

Ok this is it... time for sleep."

,Glenn74,2006-12-28T11:31Z,"For Nezzox - the reason why one might want only one of the DVDs is that one have gotten the other two from other sources. I just want to fill up the hole, you see. But, I dont want to complain about something that is free :-)"
