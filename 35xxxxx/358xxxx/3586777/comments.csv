,Titan360,2007-01-05T22:01Z,What version of picture package ? I will try this tonight and let you know. Thanks !!
,fogus,2007-01-25T05:02Z,"Hey, this is version 1.8.1.  Sorry it took so long for me to find, my computer was broken for a while.  Now I have all new parts and I'm seeding again."
,fogus,2007-02-09T00:02Z,"Hey, and if there are any updates, they are available for free.  Sony only charges the ridiculous fee for CD distribution, and offers no download.  This, Sony, is why I posted this.  I finally found my CD and decided to HELP USERS.  This picture package is for hardware Sony products.  Why be so hard on your customers, Sony?

,dusan.grbic,2007-03-18T19:26Z,i have download torrent. what shal I do now?
,torquepoint,2007-03-19T19:25Z,"Thanks fogus... you saved my life!

I can't understand why people continue to buy Sony rubbish. Most other manufactuers supply software for free on their sites if you buy and register their products. Sony just have to do everything differently. 

I only need this software as my girlfriend borrowed the camera from her work to use on a holiday to India and they lost the disc, otherwise I wouldn't go anywhere near Sony.

I used to buy Sony years ago, but they have gone downhill in recent years.

Sony products may look good, but the build quality is poor as they usually use cheap components. Has anyone ever noticed how many of their products die just after the warranty expires??!!!

Anyway... that's my rant.

Thanks again for the torrent.....much appreciated.

,fogus,2007-03-24T20:37Z,"Guys, I am back from vacation, sorry for the delay in answering your questions.  In order they were posted:

davetab001:

Your question: ""hey, why when i downlaod it takes so! long""

The reason is because bandwidth is not free, and the collective users do not have enough money to make it very fast.


dusan.grbic:
Your question: ""i have download torrent. what shal I do now?""

When you say you downloaded the torrent, what do you mean?  If you downloaded the little ""http://torrents.thepiratebay.org/3586777/Sony_Handycam_Picture_Package.3586777.TPB.torrent"" file, then you have to open it with a torrent downloader.  I highly recommend utorrent.  Google it.  If you mean that you have downloaded the Sony_Handycam_Picture_Package.ISO that the .torrent contains the hash information for, then you should burn that to a CD, or mount it using a CD drive emulator.

torquepoint:  thanks for your comments!  I heartily agree with your rant.  This torrent is meant for people exactly like you!

mbarnes023:
your question: ""This isn't working for me. How do I obtain the ISO?""

Please read my response to dusan.grbic's question.  That should clear things up.

346 Downloads as of this posting.  I'm happy to help so many! :D"

,fogus,2007-04-04T08:43Z,"69.00 a head at 433 downloads is nearly 30 grand.  I'm just so happy I can help you guys out!  Personally I hate this software, however its very hardware specific, and people simply loose it.  No one should be making money off of people loosing things that they could give out for free.

I tried to post it up on as many forums as I could get on to so people would find it.  If I could ask any of you to do something in return, it would be to tell more people that this exists now.  I remember vowing to myself, after talking to a Sony rep who asked me for $69, that if I ever found the disk, I would upload it for the rest of my days.  Thankfully I found it.  Please help others find it too.  Post it on forums.  Tell your friends.

At 433 downloads: this thing seems to be explosive!

,harias_uk,2007-05-05T14:29Z,is any one still seeding this?
,fogus,2007-05-22T04:22Z,"Sony:

You may redeem your image by making the next version of the Sony Picture Package available to download for free on thepiratebay.org 

I, personally, would also appreciate it if you would release a DVD version of the next Underworld movie here also.


kleivin:

Well, I wish you were right and it was ""40 thousand grand"", but we are not there yet (although we continue to get closer).  Anyone got 40 thousand grand (aka 40 million) they can give me?  Thanks for downing this.


harias_uk:

I will be seeding this until 1.9.x comes out, or until I have a more recent version to upload.  In short, yes, there are people still seeding this, including me.

Happy birthday to my bro, shmithers (not known by that name everywhere).  An awesome guy.

,and448,2008-01-20T11:57Z,"hey fogus
is this a direct copy of the CD? shouldn't it work on Mac too? anyone know how to install this sofware on mac....any ideas?

thanks dude"
,fogus,2008-02-24T08:12Z,"plm2200:  Yeah, I_had that problem too for a while.  I think that menu is simply broken.  I think you can access any option a different way (it is software published by Sony)

ccohe: Am I sure this works?  Nope.  (it is software published by Sony)

and448: Yes, this is an ISO image of the CD (created by directly imaging the CD).  I figured that that is what people wanted.  Does it work on a mac?  No clue.  (I don't)

Perhaps more helpful: Mac images (whatever the equivalent to ISO is) don't work on my PC (or any that I have tried them on).  Perhaps you need to convert the disk to a different format?  I looked on the disk just now and it did not say anything about macs or PCs."
,aldet001,2008-03-06T04:05Z,"ok...so i have the iso file...but when i click on it in the dowloaded torrents section of utorrent...it needed another software to recognize that file.

,fogus,2008-07-29T20:33Z,"Seeing the large number of problems people are having with this, I thought I would recommend that anyone looking to buy a camera consider going with a hard disk model (Sony or otherwise).  

I will never buy a camera that needs special software to dowload the video clips again.  The Sony Picture Package is the essence of bad design.  Draging and dropping .mpg files is the right way."

You sound confused.  There is no password for this torrent.  There is no serial number.  There is no part number.  There is no ""and so on"" either.

Sony is asking for the serial number for your camera (most likely)."

Far out.  Thank you so much and Sony does suck, trying to make money on something they have already sold once.  Double jeapordy, and guess what, it is the last time I will buy sony. I have Sony camera, sony computer, sony TV, sony receiver, sony DVD player, and sony DCR-HC21.  Last time I buy sony anything.  Next time I buy any electronics Sony has lost a life long customer and I will never speak highly of them again.  And they call this PirateBay.  Sony is the pirates.  Dogs that they are.  I really have a good mind just to smash all my stuff and pile it out in front of my house with signs saying what a rip off sony is.  No more sony for me, nothing, not ever again.
