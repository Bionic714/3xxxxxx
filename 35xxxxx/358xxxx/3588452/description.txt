I upload this, because everything can be found on the net (check Canon's Aussie site, really great) but Canon in Sweden (and their EU site) want's you to buy manuals (!), etc. from a third party... Lame mofo attitude! Also, when I lost my disc to my IxusV2, that gave me some problems. Perhaps I can help someone out there with this.
So I present to you the latest (I hope) disc that came with my Ixus850IS (actually IXY900IS, as it is called in Korea).

Note: My ISP is f*cked up, so I only have 0,5MB up for now, please bear with me. Even if I go offline, I will go back up and seed within 12hrs. I am superseeding.
