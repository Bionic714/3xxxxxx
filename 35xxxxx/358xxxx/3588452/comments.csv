,drys,2007-01-02T22:59Z,Thats ok i will help ;)
,ungern,2007-01-03T19:14Z,"I think it works like a charm. Read one of the tests on http://www.dcviews.com/reviews/Canon-SD800/Canon-SD800-review.htm
Stabiliser is superb."
,ungern,2007-01-12T23:51Z,"Another great review:

,SgtPsycho,2007-01-30T22:56Z,"Thanks so much!

I lost my software disk too, so couldn't do any photostitching.  Canon only provides updates to the original software... they won't give you the software online.

Very annoying..."
,Slocetung,2007-02-07T10:40Z,"Plz seed this nice program. I've lost my cd too..

Thx"
,ungern,2007-02-11T17:10Z,"Seeding again.
Sorry if this torrent is not seeded sometimes, I kind of expect leechers to stay online to seed and keep the torrent alive fรถr a while. :)"
,Frood12,2007-02-23T05:31Z,"What a great torrent! Software that is free from the manufacturer *except* for the fact that they won't allow you to download it for ANY price here in the US. I agree, Canon has their CCD chip shoved way up their Flash-hole. I have the original CD v19.0 (ZoomBrowser EX 4.6....much older than this torrent offers) but I too will seed on request. There's a new ZoomBrowser upgrade to version 5.8 available that is very nice but you MUST have an older version of ZoomBrowser (like this one) installed to use it. 

I have a fast connection and will get you started but you have to contact me, I don't seed this thing on a regular basis.

If you are the owner of a fairly new (last few years, like '05+) Canon digital camera, you want ZoomBrowser. Trust me. It has a lot of very nice features but the biggest one for me is that it will download all the pics from your camera into separate folders based on the date the pictures were taken. If you're trying to photographically document a long term event (the growing up of a child for instance), this feature is worth its weight in gold. All the other crappy Canon programs just barf up the pictures into one big pile on your hard drive and it's up to you to sort it out.

Anyway, if you know your Canon and you don't have ZoomBrowser, you're already sold so I'll just shut up now.

THANKS UNGERN, GOOD ON YOU."
,ungern,2007-03-03T10:10Z,"Thanks Frood12, always nice to get a thanks  =)"
,spiffy9,2007-03-12T14:51Z,"Nice job, well done,
any chance you could upload the digital ""video"" version in english please. ty"
,knx,2007-06-10T17:07Z,Does it work with C EOS 30D?
,ungern,2007-06-24T22:21Z,"It should, but does it hurt to download and try? :)"
,ungern,2007-06-24T22:23Z,"Oh, btw I had to reinstall my laptop, so this torrent is gone at my end. This will be alive as long as you keep it up. Thanks!"
,Frood12,2007-10-11T14:06Z,"I got you covered ungern. This disk is pure gold. I've decided to seed it indefinitely since I can't get in trouble for distributing a free utility. My upload ratio is currently 53.8

A lot of new ""system cleaners"" are now disabling certain PNP services on your machine that ZoomBrowser depends on. They're being disabled because they can be used by viruses to damage your machine. If your PNP services have been disabled, ZoomBrowser will not recognize that your camera is plugged in no matter what you do. VERY FRUSTRATING. 

When I have a few minutes, I'll post instructions on how to reactivate the needed PNP services temporarily. Once you're done communicating with your camera, you can shut the services down again to keep your machine safe. It's a pain but worth it. "
,TekHousE,2007-12-15T14:16Z,"Thanks for this.

I just bought a 40d and the software that came with it will not install at all. Version of mine is 15.1..

I hope this one works.."
,elefantti,2008-01-10T22:11Z,"Does anyone has the user manual for the Ixus 850IS or 950 or 960?
Can someone upload one of them?"
,ungern,2008-02-28T22:48Z,"Hmm, I have it, but just moved, so it's in a box somewhere. Have you got hold of it yet?"
,nir_kumar21,2008-05-13T00:21Z,"Thx a ton buddy........i needed this sofware very badly......I  have this canon camera but lost cd at a very bad time......actually version 25....i hope v29 works fine....Thx again and keep up good work.....

,danne999se,2008-08-16T02:05Z,"Thanks!! :-) Im out traveling and had to reinstall my laptop and I dont have the CD with me, only the 850 cam. "
,Vorperblad,2008-09-27T12:49Z,"thanx! An all-in-one package. Works on my G2, since I bought from a hock-shop w/out a cd"
,ungern,2008-11-10T23:44Z,Glad to help out! :)
,kust0m,2008-11-27T19:25Z,does anyone know if this works for camcorders?
,ungern,2008-12-18T22:38Z,"Nope, you need the digital vireo solution disk for videocams"
,Frood12,2008-12-27T14:37Z,"Okay, it's been over a year but here are some instructions for getting around the ""camera not found"" problem.....

If you run ZoomBrowser and you plug your camera in and get a two-tone ""bee-boop"" confirmation but then can't access your camera to do anything, try the following (if you use Windows):

Go to Control panel
Go to Administrative Tools
Go to Services
Start the SSDP Discovery Service (you may need to change its' status to Manual)
Start the Universal Plug and Play Device Host (you may need to change its' status to Manual)
Reboot
Start ZoomBrowser again

A lot of disk cleaners and virus protection programs turn these older services off so malware can't sneak in through these routes but ZoomBrowser depends on these services. You might want to set the services back to Disabled when you're done with ZoomBrowser.

Just remember that you MUST have a previous version of ZoomBrowser installed in order to use their ""Updater"". You can not download an entire copy of ZoomBrowser from Canon which is insane since this free utility comes with every applicable camera anyway. Getting your foot in the door so you can use the Canon Updater is what this torrent is for. "
,ungern,2009-01-10T21:25Z,"Frood12, I thank you for your support! :)
Just put up v37.2 here... time to let go of v29.0 perhaps? :P"
,metro2,2009-04-08T20:41Z,Is this for Mac  - it is listede for  Windows but there are  no EXE files or others that Windows uses
,ungern,2009-04-09T21:00Z,"Are you for real?

Read the info. Btw, it's an ISO..."
