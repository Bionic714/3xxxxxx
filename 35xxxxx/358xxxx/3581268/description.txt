          | The Prince of Persia, a seasoned warrior, returns from   | 
          | the Island of Time to Babylon with his love Kaileena.    |
          | Instead of the peace that he longs for, he finds his     |
          | homeland ravaged by war and the kingdom turned against   |
          | him. The Prince is rapidly captured and Kaileena has no  |
          | choice but to sacrifice herself and unleash the Sands of | 
          | Time in order to save him. Now cast to the streets and   |
          | hunted as a fugitive, the Prince soon discovers that past| 
          | battles have given rise to a deadly Dark Prince, whose   |
          | spirit gradually possesses him...                        |
