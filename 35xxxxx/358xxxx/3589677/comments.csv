,antimatterserpent,2008-01-16T06:05Z,I'm stuck at 98.6%.  Will someone please seed for 5 or 10 minutes?  Then I will seed.  This is a good torrent- please keep it alive.
,antimatterserpent,2008-01-16T08:22Z,Thank you very much!
,Fire1052,2012-05-29T22:18Z,Someone stopped seeding after about 20 minutes in to my download. Got ~45% of the way through. I'll seed for a good while if anyone else will seed for me.
