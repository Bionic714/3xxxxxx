,Fenk@,2006-12-26T11:04Z,Funkar inte med den svenska!
,BlueGyver,2006-12-27T12:46Z,"Works like a charm...this is NOT a virus.  This is a LEGITIMATE WORKING KEYGEN FOR Office 2007 Enterprise.

Now...if we can only get keygens for Visio 2007 and Project 2007...

FYI...you DO NOT NEED TO REINSTALL TO USE A NEW PRODUCT KEY.  See:

http://bloggingabout.net/blogs/mglaser/archive/2006/12/12/Change-Office-2007-Product-Key.aspx

Essentially, the steps are:

1.	Close all Microsoft Office applications.

2.	Click Start, click Run, type regedit in the Open box, and then click OK.

3.	Locate the following registry subkey:
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Office\12.0\Registration
Note You may also find another subkey that resembles the following subkey:
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Office\12.0\Registration\{30120000-0011-0000-0000-0000000FF1CE}

4.	If you find additional subkeys that reference Microsoft 12.0 registration, open each subkey, and then identify the product by the ProductName entry. For example:
ProductName=Microsoft Office Professional Plus 2007

5.	When you find the subkey for the product from which you want to remove the existing product license key, delete the following entries:
?	DigitalProductID
?	ProductID

6.	Exit Registry Editor.

The next time that you try to run an Office application, you will be prompted for a new product license key."

Twenty of them. I can verify this torrent works, though. The chicken for xmas thing at the beginning is just a joke, and by the way:

Most keygen's aren't viruses! The heuristics (byte by byte check) of antivirus software just picks them up as malware because of all the code incorporated. As for the double rar, it might have been trying to help with the false alarm some antiviruses trigger.

And get rid of that AVG shit and download Comodo firewall."

,hcalex666,2010-10-06T07:59Z,DON'T DOWNLOAD if you have a version that came preinstalled. Keygen doesn't work for it.
,maykaDK,2010-11-25T14:45Z,"it is without viruses (scanned by KIS 11.0.1.400), but keygen didn't help me. codes just didn't fit."

,raindeux,2011-07-14T06:34Z,"Ain't a fuckin virus you fail trolls. This shit works perfectly. First download to actually work for me thanks. Worked on the 1st key it gave me. Just double click the torrent, and click search, copy-paste the key it gives you into the box for Enterprise activation and hit Enter. Done."
,SecretAgentWoman,2011-07-26T17:54Z,"Sure, the keygen gives a serial, but will it ACTIVATE? That is where I keep getting stuck."
,Dynasty11,2011-09-07T19:12Z,Works fine for me.
,everlasting.divinity,2011-09-14T20:10Z,"I have Microsoft Pre-installed, you know with the laptop when it came, will it still work or will I have to download another version? Or something.."
,daniel4567,2011-10-06T01:07Z,"Worked perfectly well for me :) on Microsoft Office Enterprise 2007. Some antyviruses may say its a trojan, but dont worry it is not. It is often the case that antywiruses find cracks and keygens as a virus. If the program doesnt work make sure you have extracted all the files into one folder. From the first .rar (mo2007ek) you will get the second .rar (keygen) extract the second one as well into the same folder than run keygen exe and press search. Enjoy your key ;). Hope i helped, sry for my bad english"
