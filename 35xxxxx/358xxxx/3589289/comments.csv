,lotus_anima,2007-01-17T10:51Z,"For me, the location of that application.sif file was more like:
Applications/Adobe Photoshop CS3/Adobe Photoshop CS3.app/Contents/Resources/AMT/application.sif

For those having trouble on a mac, just do this in the command-line assuming you've installed to the default area:
mv Applications/Adobe Photoshop CS3/Adobe Photoshop CS3.app/Contents/Resources/AMT/application.sif Applications/Adobe Photoshop CS3/Adobe Photoshop CS3.app/Contents/Resources/AMT/application_bak.sif"

By the command line do you mean the ""find"" option?"

~/Applications/Utliites"

,mhornbach,2007-02-07T12:51Z,"Applications are actually folders in Mac OS.
Here's how to open your photoshop.app file (the thing you press to start the program for you noobs).

Click on the file with your right mouse button and select ""view package contents"". It will reveal it's contents and you can open the file and change the name like the instructions here say:

,spiralgirl,2007-02-20T18:40Z,I can't install this because it keeps saying I have to close the TWAINbridge.  What is this?  I just got Photoshop so haven't learned it yet.  Is this something in Photoshop?
,konceito,2007-02-23T07:58Z,Does this work for Windows?
,spiralgirl,2007-02-23T20:15Z,"Okay I got it installed and figured out my problem.  When I open the program though it says I'm missing some plug ins and tells me to go to the help program info (or something like that), then it lists all the plug-ins I'm missing.

Anyone know where I can get these or maybe my CS2 had missing plug-ins.

,rubberkeith,2007-04-29T13:08Z,"spiralgirl: Open the Activity Monitor in Utilities, then search within it for TWAINBridge. Highlight it and press the ""quit process"" button.

I think TWAINBridge is used by image capture apps like iPhoto for connectivity with scanners, cameras etc, so be wary of this as you quit it."

If you are having problems uninstalling Photoshop, it isn't too hard. Just look for Adobe folders in your /Applications folder and your /Applications/Utilities folder."
