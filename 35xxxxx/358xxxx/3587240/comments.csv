,swfsnapper,2008-04-11T21:00Z,"Watched the film, but this audio book is worth listening to, superb! Audio isn't great and  a few glitches on the last couple of tracks but didn't ruin my enjoyment. I have seen this avaliable on CD now, so mabye an digital version will surface soon. 

Yet again, don't hesitate to download and listen to this audio book. You will enjoy it!!

Thanks Bob!

PS 297Mbs is worth the trouble.

PPS Anyone got any other fav audio books that they could recommend, don't hesitate to PM me. I just listened to Playing for Pizza by John Grisham... great fun, really enjoyed it."

,wrlitzr,2011-07-03T21:32Z,The audio is very choppy... I can't even listen to it because it pauses in the middle of words. Is anyone else getting that problem?
,wrlitzr,2011-07-03T22:16Z,"Nevermind, I downloaded it on another computer and it plays smoothly. Great upload. Thank you Bob!"
