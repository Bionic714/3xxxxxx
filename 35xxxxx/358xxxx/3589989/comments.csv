Mr Japan, I know your ancestors had problems controlling their agressions.. That's why Hiroshima burned 63 years ago. However, Stop writing threatening retarded comments not relevant regarding the file, please..."
,politikill,2008-05-07T00:01Z,"Which is more ""treasonous"", scottfry1988? Michael Moore expressing his opinion and exercising his rights, or you saying he should be put in prison for doing so?

And you quote him ""more or less""? That doesn't even make sense. It's either a quote, or it's not a quote.

Finally, he's a filmmaker. If you don't like what he has to say, guess what? You have the right to not watch his films or read his books! Amazing, huh? And if you're going to insist on watching/reading them, maybe you should take Khardon's advice. Just because he says something you don't agree with doesn't mean he should be put in prison or hanged.

And I'm not even gonna start on MrJapan's fascist statement. I think it says enough on it's own.

Anyways, I'll seed this for a while after I finish it. Thanks!"

Please don't hate my country. We're not all stupid. It's just that our corrupt, greedy politicians are ruining it, and half of America does nothing to stop it i.e. vote.

I apologize profusely for my country and some of the knuckle-dragging, mouth-breathing gorillas that defend a shoddy government which does horrible things like treat the very people that defend it like crap. As penance, I shall seed when I am finished downloading. :)"

Yes I know America isn't full of selfish, psychotic idiots (Although it's got its fair share).

I've been there quite a few times now, as my brother lives there and the trouble is that, in America as, to a lesser extent, here in the UK, the the selfish psychos tend to have an inordinate amount of power."
