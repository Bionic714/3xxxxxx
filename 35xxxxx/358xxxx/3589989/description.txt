The Awful Truth'is the television show Michael Moore made.  It used to be called "Tv Nation" but after it was moved to a new network (Bravo) it changed its name.  If you liked "Bowling for Columbine" and "Roger & Me" and "The Big One", you'll love "The Awful Truth".
please share these with as many people as possible and put them in a location where they can be downloaded from your shares.  thanks.
