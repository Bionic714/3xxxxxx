,Lensman,2006-12-25T00:16Z,"21:30 ""Have not those who disbelieve known that the heavens and the earth were joined together as one united piece (/as one unit of creation), before We clove them asunder (/then We parted them)? We made from water every living thing, Will they not then believe?""

This passage not only just describe ""Big Bang"" (common origin of earth and heaven) and beginning of evolution from water, as Allah said that He created us from soil of the earth, from which our food, origin for semen and growth is, that soil has formed from died animals and plants originated from water.


FUCKING HILARIOUS!!   get some logic and stop  making crazy leaps, this is on par with the davinci code :D

oh and jesus was not a muslim...jesus preached peace and goodwill to ALL men (if he existed)

islam just promotes violence towards ""kaffirs"" (non belivers)

and if the koran is so ""scientific"" why are all muslim countries technological and economic shitholes?   and if its so good why are you in FINLAND???!?!"

,rockstar11998,2008-03-12T16:44Z,Dr. Kakir is annoying to listen to.  I only watched about 15 minutes and he kept going back and forth speaking Arabic and broken English.   It was really hard to follow.  All he did was tell others where they are wrong by quoting the Koran.    Aside from that Islam IS evil at its core and should be kept a close watch on if its already in your country/community.  Muhammad was no prophet and Satan is the head of that religion.  Kill Kill Kill molest molest rape rape force force intolerance intolerance lie lie hate hate hate hate deceive deceive.  These are all attributes of Satan not Godliness.

,peacekeeper77,2009-08-19T23:06Z,"Muslims will never speak against Moses or Jesus (My peace be on them). please before commenting read Quran first. suicide bombers or terrorists are not mulims. We believe in Peace and believe in freedom of religion. can anyone anwer why Islam is best spread religion even in US. Even after 9 / 11 coz peole accepting Islam after studying Islam not bcoz of Idiot osama bin laden. islam considers killing of one innocent as killing of whole humanity. Hitler was not muslim he was christian so do I have a right to consider all christians as Hitler. Definately NO. Same is with us, acts of terror is different and fight for Right is different. If you fight for a right cause you are never terrorist. plz read Islam before making any comment which can harm you. May peace and blessing of Allah be with you all."
,rudaba7,2010-01-07T17:55Z,"Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) was the last  and final example send for us and thus he was meant to do a lot of things in order for us to follow them. for sake of argument even if i agree that he married ayesha(may Allah be pleased with her) he did not do it against her will and definitely it was for some purpose for the better good. non muslims keep quoting these verses of the quran that they do not understand , they were revealed during war times and directed the Prophets to do so, we are just being told what Allah told them in those situations.If you really have the guts to fight then why not fight as well about the proven scientific facts that Quran spoke about 1400 hundred yrs back.forget science it also gives facts about geology,astronomy,physics and many more that has recently been discovered. i would suggest all to read the quran with better understanding, with references and also consult scholars to explain you the meaning cause you are definitely not being able to read between the lines."
