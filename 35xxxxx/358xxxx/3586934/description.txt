Concluding part of Channel 4's Iraq: Legacy of Hate strand. The torture and slaughter of Iraqi civilians is reaching unprecedented heights with estimates of up to 655,000 dead. Night after night death squads rampage through Iraq's main cities. In Baghdad, up to 100 bodies a day are dumped on the streets.

"Everyday in Iraq, up to 100 mutilated bodies are found. They're not killed by Sunni insurgents. They're mostly killed by Shia death squads who are ethnically cleansing Baghdad in a systematic campaign. Many of the killers are actually policeman. Behind them, senior religeous and political figures stand accused. Those accused of supporting this daily carnage, are the same people America has put in power to shape the future of Iraq."
