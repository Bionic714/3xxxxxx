Features:

-Pushback with sound, animated objects and automatic perfect alignment
-Animated gates that link up perfect to the doors of the aircraft (unlike other system),
-Follow me car to show the way to the parking position (looks a lot better than those strange arrows used by Microsoft!)
-Sound effects while rolling over the centerline lights at the runway
-Simulation of water or snow at the runway
-Highly detailed (3d) marshaller at all parking positions that do not have docking assistance systems
