,allen_x,2007-01-04T02:15Z,is there a AES for all the major airports in the world ?
,4X-AXG,2007-01-04T02:20Z,"nope not yet, with every new version there are new/more airports included"
,allen_x,2007-01-04T02:23Z,"thanks man, really appreciate it"
,neslesman,2007-01-04T02:46Z,That looks like quite a gimmick Aerosoft has got going.  Why don't they just give the pirates what they downloaded right off the bat?
,blankbox,2007-01-04T03:51Z,"...here I am sitting down in front of the fabulous twin towers in beautiful down-town KL. Its 10.00 in the morning temp is already a balmy 27 degrees and Im downing my first Anchor of the day. Then neslesman has to post that...which got me to cogitating., He's right you know...they are just like that 2 bit hooker we all have come to love... you know the one...
1 buck ....you get to look
2 bucks ....you get to sniff
3 bucks .....you get to touch
.......and on...and on...and on..
...well pretty soon you've laid out a hundred bucks....and you haven't been laid yet ..hehe
..oh....ya wanna kiss me honey....that'll be an extra deuce....hmmmm ??

ahhhhh....shit...least the beers cheap.."

It's always 2ice as nice when someone like you shows a n00b how it's SHOULD be done ;-)"
,kachira108,2007-01-04T04:50Z,"Do i need to install the base pack from aerosoft website?

Thanks for sharing!
4X-AXG~THANKS!"
,neslesman,2007-01-04T05:45Z,"Kachira it's a case of ""if"" you have any of those airports they will do you a favour a activate the stuff that's already there but you can't have.  That's after you waste a half hour figuring it all out.  They could take a lesson from UK2000.  Ya also gotta get  your aiplane ""fitted"".  

It's a little like forbidden fruit.

Good analogy there blankbox.

,BritneysOrifice,2007-01-04T06:31Z,"nes: Actually, it's pretty easy to get the aircraft fitted and have it all working in minutes. Love this little addon. This stuff is totally easy if you're an old skool flightsim tweaker (and the dain bramage isn't too heavy). "
,kachira108,2007-01-04T06:48Z,"Sorry~I mean the Airport Enhancement Services base pack from Aerosoft one~!It is because they provide a base pack at their web and the credits is another addon on their base pack(that's mean they required basepack for credits more aiport)I wonder that do i need to install the base pack+this one/ only this.

Thanks guys!
Good DAY!"

Just put the numbers 00 to 99 where ?? is standing:

With this trick I have 990 credits now ôÔ"
,BritneysOrifice,2007-01-12T19:51Z,"Oh boy. These serials no longer function with the new AES 1.2, released Jan 11th. Bummer."
,eftelrobje,2007-01-12T22:14Z,"Hi,

i have one that works. no only we have to know what figures we have to change to et more of this serials.  

The one that works is :

aes-171-16242-n3522-48556"
,JetmanHB,2007-01-13T16:53Z,"Just found out how you can make version 1.20 working with the credit serial of 1.10!

1. Install version 1.20
2. copy the folders ""airports"", ""scenery"" and ""texture"" from AES folder anywhere on your harddisk
3. uninstall version 1.20
4. install version 1.10
5. paste the new version's airports, scenery and texture folders in AES main directory
6. Make sure NOT to overwrite if prompted (very important -otherwise it will result in an error massage)
7. Start AEShelp and convert the Demo airports to full ones by using the serial provided in this package.

Works perfect on my system. "
,BritneysOrifice,2007-01-13T17:27Z,"Jetman: now that's brilliant! I'm just about to try it, but have a question: did you *already* have 1.10 installed before you install ed 1.20? In other words, did you simply install 1.20 over it, or did you completely uninstall AES?  Secondly... were you able to do the little +1 thing to the serial in order to generate more credits?  Thanks for any info; you came up with a great workaround."
,BritneysOrifice,2007-01-13T18:34Z,"Jetman: one more thing, though. Something has me confused. You say NOT to overwrite any of the files when copying them over, otherwise you'll receive an error. But the AES 1.2 update did more than add airports; it also added new services at those airports... such as new aircraft guidance systems for proper jetway alignment. If we *don't* overwrite the airports, doesn't that essentially mean we'll be missing the new stuff?  Have you tested it out at those specific airports? Additionally, have you tested out any of the NEW airports added to this package?  Just wanting to get some more info. Thanks!"
,eftelrobje,2007-01-14T00:19Z,"To BritneysOrifice :

Well it doesn't work. You can get the credits but if you go to one of the new airports the follow me, gates and pushback ar not working.

At least at Gran canaria and Budapest. The airports that i tried. So i'm afraid we have to look for another solution.

Any one have an idea?

greetz"
,BritneysOrifice,2007-01-14T01:41Z,"eftel: thanks for following up. Hopefully something will be along. The trouble with any approach to a warez solution for this package is that -- since Aerosoft monitors all the torrents sites...especially this one (hi, Aerosoft!) -- it's highly likely that with each and every airport expansion, new serials will be blacklisted.  Bummer. :(  Once again, though, thanks for following up!"
,charonB,2007-01-24T20:08Z,"Teamwork is great...

Thanks to eftelrobje, ready2taxi and my super-intelligence, you'll get flooded with serials for AES 1.2 now:
