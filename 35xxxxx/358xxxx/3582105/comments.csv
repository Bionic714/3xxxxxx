To sasaxxx:
Are you imbecille? If something is more than six month's old you think that people that would want it would find it immediately? You need to seed for a at least a month!!!

,cheeesen,2007-01-08T14:59Z,season 2 anyone???
,Hamurabi,2007-01-13T01:18Z,I agree with cheeesen: What has happened to season two? DoesnÂ´t it exist? I find nothing on channel 4's site...
,Hamurabi,2007-01-23T21:51Z,"Yes, Dog, it was schedued to the 5TH of JANUARY!!!

WTF, if you look at channel4's site it's strangely quiet about it - even on ""IT Crowd""'s own homepage!!

My guess is that some Dinosaur saw it and decided that since computers are just a fad anyway they'd cancel it.

Possibly it might have been delayed 'til the autumn, though."
,sasaxxx,2007-02-06T21:21Z,seeding again
,mJohnson66,2007-02-13T22:14Z,Who's got the Brit DVD? Someone rip and seed that please?
