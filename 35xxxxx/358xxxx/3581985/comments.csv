,Ykalon,2006-12-23T15:24Z,Why the heck you want to do that for? Thousands time better if you DON'T rar it.
,univibe69,2006-12-24T08:40Z,"Really?
AFAIK, RAR-ing helps preserve the integrity of the contents - is that not so?  "
[T],Knaster,2006-12-24T11:12Z,and why can't you delete it yourself?
,univibe69,2006-12-24T16:27Z,Sorry - I was unaware that deletion was possible - how?
