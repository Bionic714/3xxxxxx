,Largo-Sama,2007-04-04T12:55Z,For some reason i couldn't start this game. I get some japanese text on the screen with yes/no choices.I can't read all of it but it says something about system check and memory card. Whatever i choose they will just pop up again. I have played pop'n music which is japanese and saves to the memory card so my system should be compatible. I am booting from a swapmagic3.6 disc.
