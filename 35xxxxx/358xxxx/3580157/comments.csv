,Beksinski,2006-12-23T12:58Z,Thank you very much.
,oddish12,2006-12-23T16:41Z,"Can anyone confirm whether this works or not, I've got someone telling me that it doesn't?"
,woodenheart,2007-01-07T02:53Z,"the video only has 18 of sound when played with wmp, but when i played it with neuro, there was sound all the way through, but the video locked up at the end. "
,DARK X,2007-01-23T19:44Z,"For all the people that have a problem with this movie: Download VLC media player from the internet and all of your problems will be gone. You will have 2 hours and 25 minutes of the film instead of 1 hour and 45 minutes, and you will have the sound all the way. VLC media player is the best video player to be found. I never had any problems when it comes to it. Download it, see it for yourself.
Regards, Darko"
