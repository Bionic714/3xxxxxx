`Red Corner' released in '97 is a surprisingly taunt, entertaining and subdued romantic murder mystery. 

Synopsis: Jack Moore (Richard Gere) is an American businessman entrapped within the Chinese Communist legal system. He awakens from a romantic one night stand to find himself accused of the grisly murder of a beautiful Chinese woman. A woman who also happens to be the daughter of a powerful Communist official, Jack pleas of innocence fall on deaf ears until he convinces his attorney Shen Yuelin (Ling Bai) that he is being framed. Can one lone female voice halt the powerful forces that seek the death of the American? 

Richard Gere delivers a strong performance, but Ling Bai is the real star as the demure, yet strong willed and beautiful attorney. `Red Corner' is a little strong handed in its depiction of justice behind the Bamboo Curtain, but the story and romance make it well worth the time.
