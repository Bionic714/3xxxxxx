,inhahe,2008-02-10T16:40Z,the sound dousn't fscking work. what a waste of time.
,inhahe,2008-02-10T16:44Z,"n/m, i see that it says the audio codec in the description.  i'll download that and see what happens, assuming ac3 isn't something that i should have by default."
,bartman34,2008-07-12T20:03Z,"the end is missing???
seen this movie years ago, love it!!!!

Anyone knows for sure????"
,pipo90,2008-10-03T19:22Z,"stop seeding this one, image quality perfect.........but NO SOUNDDDDDD because of the high seed-level i thought it was oke, grrr 2 hours for nothing!"
,DonDuracell,2008-12-29T22:19Z,"I've got no problem with the sound when using the VLC player.
Only one thing to complain about the sound is that it is a little bit to low."
,ipedreroc,2009-01-10T21:26Z,Thanks!!!!
,camicio,2009-02-27T20:58Z,"Video is fine, Audio is a little too low but it shouldn't  be a problem. English subtitles available on podnapisi."
,steveturner,2009-03-19T00:38Z,"There's only 2 torrents of this movie on the net that I could find.

This was the better find, but downloaded slightly slower.

I'll seed as much as I can, I hope y'all do as well."
