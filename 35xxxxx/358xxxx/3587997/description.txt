The Blues - The Radio Series
  
Beginning in September of 2003, Public Radio International stations nationwide broadcast "The Blues," thirteen hour-long programs hosted by Grammy Award-winning bluesman Keb' Mo', produced by Robert Santelli, EMP Radio, and Ben Manilla, Ben Manilla Productions, and presented by WGBH Radio, Boston. 


Each episode of this comprehensive chronicle includes a visit to a celebrated blues location. Venues such as the Delta Blues Museum, the Chess Studios in Chicago, and Beale Street in Memphis emphasize the music's contemporary connections and establish a firm sense of place. Each program breathes life into blues history and culture with new and archival interviews from prominent artists, historians, record producers, and of course, historic and modern-day blues recordings. Each episode ends with a performance of a seminal blues song from a contemporary artist.
