,martinexd007,2009-09-06T21:13Z,"Thanx very much for the upload & seeding.  It was a great flick -- I want to read the series!

I guess it's not likely, but I sure would like to see the rest of the novels done in the same stop-motion style.  Love the stuff!

Very decent quality too, considering the file size!"
