F-Secure Internet Security 2007

Todays's challenges


In addition to computer viruses, there is now a new breed of threats on the Internet, such as carefully planned targeted attacks that can pass through conventional security solutions unnoticed, possibly taking over your computer for illegal purposes. For this reason, it is essential to protect your computer not only against computer viruses and worms, but also against any suspicious activity that might be a sign of danger in your computer.

The solution

F-Secure速 Internet Security 2007 provides a complete and easy-to-use protection against all Internet threats, whether they are known or previously unidentified. It includes an award-winning antivirus, an easy-to-use personal firewall, an improved antispyware and a new technology, F-Secure DeepGuard, that constantly monitors the very heart of your computer, ensuring that no malicious programs can take over your computer even if you do not have all the latest updates. In addition, the product filters unwanted spam and so-called phishing attempts from your e-mail, and with the parental control, you can block access to websites with questionable content."
