Do your own research.

Fire does not melt steel at 1200 degrees F.

Steel melts at 2750 degrees F.

It's a technical impossibility for steel to melt at 1200. And it will certainly not melt in a dirty un-controlled open-air kerosine-fuelled fire.

You cannot get a 110-story pancake collapse in 8,4 seconds (free fall speed - the speed at which an object drops through air).

Never would a pancake collapse GAIN speed and go beyond the speed of gravity, it would LOOSE speed since it would fall into the path of most resistance - the building itself. For it to fall at free fall speed the floors beneath would have to cease to exist completely BEFORE the upper floor reaches them.

George Bush and the other goons in the government can't change the laws of physics, even if they say they can.

Learn to think for yourselves."
,All_Your_Sky,2007-01-02T18:55Z,"The simple facts of temperatures:

* 1535ºC (2795ºF) - melting point of iron

* ~1510ºC (2750ºF) - melting point of typical structural steel

* ~825ºC (1517ºF) - maximum temperature of hydrocarbon fires burning in the atmosphere without pressurization or pre-heating (premixed fuel and air - blue flame)

Diffuse flames burn far cooler.

Oxygen-starved diffuse flames are cooler yet.

The fires in the towers were diffuse -- well below 800ºC.

Their dark smoke showed they were oxygen-starved -- particularly in the South Tower."
,odnaix,2007-01-02T21:05Z,"Don't mind bobdaslob, it's a government employed terrorist who comments on absolutely all 9/11 related videos.. and a good reminder for everybody: Intelligence agency terrorist in all NATO countries are still, desperately, trying to cover-up 9/11.

It's a bit late since - according to the latest polls - 85% of the US population know it was an inside job, but that don't seem to stop them from pretending to be normal people on message boards, commenting on this forum, and so on...

Haven't realized 9/11 wasn't done by 19 arabs with box-cutters yet? Download this movie - and research 9/11! And beware that it's not just DoD who don't want you to know the truth, all NATO governments are still pretending there is a ""war on terror"".. download this video - and other 9/11 videos - and compare the evidence against the propaganda on state TV."
,bobsmith5,2007-01-03T04:24Z,"bobslob, you are really having a hard time with reality. thank you for revealing the depth of mind controlled personality possibilities. you are a prime example of brainwashed denial"
,bobsmith5,2007-01-03T04:26Z,"great job commanche, these loose change boys are awesome for such a tender age. they are true patriot geniuses. thanks again for the torrent"
,polsy37,2007-01-06T05:11Z,"Which article are you referring to, Ikobescak, any link or anything? Any proof that it exists? Name of publication maybe? Any chance of you backing up your claim?"
,spankbot,2007-02-21T02:22Z,"Here is a documentary about the Loose Change idiots and their ridiculous film.

,spacey1,2008-01-16T10:01Z,"bobslob,bobdaslob,bobdaslub, all same asshole visiting every iraq doc. site including mine.  i don't believe everything in this one, but several questions are raised as they should be.

http://thepiratebay.org/user/spacey1

this one is there as well, smaller .avi format of 700mb, but seeders are low, and hopefully some people can keep it going.  29 other iraq.bsh docs. are there as well, please keep the seeds going if you can..."
,someguy_on_piratebay,2008-02-13T10:01Z,"Can anyone seed this? I was told to find it and watch. This all sounds very intresting. I want to watch it.

Please seed?"
,mazzer123,2008-04-22T16:43Z,"good film but also see for more scientific analysis (less mood music): improbable collapse, e.g.:
