I already got the Carl Barks collection, now Don Rosa. Great.
One small thing: Why those dam .cbr and .cbz files?
[if you don't know how to use them: rename to .rar and extract, you 'll get a serie of images]
The Open Office word processor manages to save files as .pdf, I'm making a Carl Barks collection using the cbr/cbz files, and I plan to do the same with Don Rosa... but it could take some time, so grab these in the meantime, C.Barks is at http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3303609/Walt_Disney_Collection_-_Carl_Barks 

tips for downloading Crl Barks using the linked torrent: add http://tpb.tracker.thepiratebay.org/announce to the tracker list, the original torrent has only http://tracker.prq.to/announce , I got a 'couldn't connect to tracker' error until I added http://tpb.tracker.thepiratebay.org/announce"
,LucisFerens,2007-01-03T19:30Z,"sorry, the torrent I used was http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3279071/Carl_Barks_Stories
do I want http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3303609/Walt_Disney_Collection_-_Carl_Barks too, or it's the same stuff?"
,LucisFerens,2007-01-03T19:41Z,OK I checked: it's the same stuff-
,Section8^2,2007-01-06T18:10Z,".cbr and .cbz files can be read by a comic book reader program, like CDisplay. "
,TheArnold,2007-02-03T11:30Z,There is also many Carl Barks stories in this torrent.
,Korhedron,2007-08-22T17:42Z,"Hey LucisFerens? Use CDisplay!
It's easy to use, and makes your reading experience so much better. Excellent upload, Scuttle"
