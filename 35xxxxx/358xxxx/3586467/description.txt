Plot:

During World War II, more than 70,000 Finnish children were evacuated to neutral Sweden to avoid the conflict. \"Mother of Mine,\" the latest from the award-winning Klaus Haro (\"Elina\"), tackles that painful patch of history in a tale of 9-year-old Eero, a child who increasingly feels abandoned by his biological Finnish mother and yet not attached to his Swedish surrogate mom. When he is returned to Finland, his confusion intensifies.
