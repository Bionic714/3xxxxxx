French Foreign Legion Documentaries:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.Laserlight 80574: Foreign legion.90's
Shows the recruit and his way to the farm and the training at the farm.
The secoond film shows the jungle training in French Guyana.
This series as a more down to earth touch to it pretty bad quality though but watchable.(VHS-rip from "xsiops" he has a good selection of other military-documentaries)

Rating: 7/10

2. Discovery:Warriors of the french foreign legion.2003
Infotainment as always I believe this film is pretty faraway from the truth.

Rating:6/10
