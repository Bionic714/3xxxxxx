This was a performance by the Byrds at a concert in 1990.  They start singing MR. Tambourine Man, then as a surprise to everyone, BOB Dylan comes on stage!  This is a fantastic alternate version of a classic Bob Dylan Masterpiece.  Although the video quality isn't great, the piece is still mind-blowing.

Enjoy
