,artytorrent,2007-10-05T11:43Z,"Crashed FL Studio 7. Couldn't use the keygen because HOST ID was blank.
Acid 6 refused to boot up.

Looks like Cubase is the only option.
Had to uninstall, so bit of a wasted download for me. :("
,karkass666,2008-02-04T22:04Z,I got the keygen to work by typing the Host ID in with spaces then going back and replacing the spaces with hyphens. wierd that it wouldn't let me just type hyphens in the  first place..

,Chuckmeister8,2010-01-05T06:31Z,"For everyone asking about the host ID, it is found on the same screen that asks for the serial and license key when you open it in your DAW. You have to enter the host ID into the keygen before you generate or it won't work."
,neoray,2010-01-12T13:26Z,Could anyone generate a license key for me? I don't have a keygen for mac. My host ID is 8953-1100-0144. Thanks a million!

,theheartlover,2011-09-30T08:32Z,"The Keygen will not open for me, no matter what I do. "
,dylanbk,2012-01-01T04:10Z,"Works fine for me, using FL Studios on Windows 7. Been waiting to try this out for ages so much thanks funkiez!"
,Gidogg,2012-01-05T12:17Z,"Works with Cubase LE 5, thanks!! To get it to work & register, just install melodyne first (after unzip etc. like it says in description) start up your DAW software (Cubase in my case) pick a channel and add 'Melodyne' in insert effects in the channel (it is not a VST instrument or anything, it's a channel insert effect) than melodyne will start in your DAW software and it will ask you to registrate. Here it will say what your Host-ID is. Copy the Host-ID and paste in the Keygen.exe from this torrent and copy&paste the serial and license nr's to the Melodyne plug-in in your software. thanks again!"
,mrhanover,2012-02-17T07:04Z,"ugh! u r all n00bz!
1. unzip all 3 folders.
2. take each rar, r00, r01 files from each folder and put them onto the main ""melodyne folder"".
3. use either ""winrar"", ""extractall"" or ""7zip"" to extract them ""highlight all 3 of them"" right click them with your extracting program and extract and tadah! if your iq was high enough you successfully did it, well done. *pats on back*
4. Run the SetUp.exe just click next on all of them ""i recommend u do"".
5. run keygen
6. load ur daw then channels then browse then more then quick scan ""or whatever method u use to find ur new vst/plugin whatever""
7. it will ask u to register and u kids r big enough to handle the copy n pasting on your own... (dont forget to copy the host id 1st*"
,BTG1989,2012-03-16T14:34Z,"Hey, i know everyones done this and you're probably all sick of it, but i run keygen.exe because i'm on a mac so can someone please get me a serial and licence? My Host ID is: 2456-6024-8281. Cheers"
