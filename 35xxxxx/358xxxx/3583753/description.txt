         ?  supremely well and in  the highly musical manner  for  ?

         ?  pitch and  volume of  individual hits,  straighten up  ?

         ?  as well  as a  new algorithm  for percussive material  ?
         ?  ensure   that   even  when   you   introduce  extreme  ?
         ?  modifications,   the   results   remain  impressively  ?
         ?  natural and the sound quality is in no way  impaired.  ?
         ?  The  programmable  scale snap  function  provides for  ?
         ?  harmonically  correct  transposition,  and  the multi  ?
         ?  -level  Undo  function for  relaxed  editing. Virtual  ?
         ?  knobs  that  can  be   automated  in  the  host   and  ?
