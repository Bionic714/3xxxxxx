,MyOthrRide,2007-02-06T17:05Z,"The albums are:
System of a Down (1998)
Toxicity (2001)
Steal This Album! (2002)
Mesmerize (2005)
Hypnotize (2005)
Hold Up in Antwerpen Bootleg

Pretty good torrent. One of the live songs, Spiders was a very small file and added to my playlist but did not play. I'm not sure if this was only a download problem with me, but oh well. 

Note: If you use iTunes to play music, note that the Toxicity album is not in a format that works with iTunes. Inside iTunes, select all of the files on the Toxicity album, and go to Advanced --> Convert Selection to AAC. It will work then."
