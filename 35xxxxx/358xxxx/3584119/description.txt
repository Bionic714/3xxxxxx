         ?  Ableton  is  proud  to  release Live 6. Like no other  ?
         ?  Ableton  release,  Live  6  has  opened itself to new  ?
         ?  creative    communities┬¿offering    Quicktime   video  ?
         ?  support,  a  professional  multisample  library,  and  ?
         ?  customizable racks of instruments and effects. Live 6  ?
         ?  also  satisfies  frequent user requests by delivering  ?
         ?  multicore support, enhanced project management tools,  ?
         ?  and improved MIDI control.                             ?

         ?  "Live  6 upholds Ableton's tradition of responding to  ?
         ?  and  respecting our vocal user base while maintaining  ?
         ?  our vision for the program," says Ableton CEO and co-  ?
         ?  founder Gerhard Behles. "The results are               ?
         ?  exciting┬¿Live  6  is  our most versatile and powerful  ?
         ?  version   to   date.   We   also   spent  significant  ?
         ?  development  resources  on  workflow  improvements to  ?
         ?  make   sure  Live  continues  to  feel  good  as  the  ?

         ?  With  Quicktime  video support, Live enters the world  ?
         ?  of  post-production.  Drag  and  drop movies directly  ?
         ?  into  Live's Arrangement View, and monitor the result  ?
         ?  on a video window or second screen. Then, align music  ?
         ?  to  visuals,  and  process  the  movie's audio signal  ?
         ?  within  Live.  It has never been easier to improvise,  ?
         ?  compose and warp music to picture.                     ?

         ?  The  Essential  Instrument Collection provides Live 6  ?
         ?  users  with  a  comprehensive library of multisampled  ?
         ?  instruments.   The  included  instruments  cover  the  ?
         ?  entire  musical spectrum, from orchestral strings and  ?
         ?  brasses,  to  classic guitars and electric keyboards,  ?
         ?  to  instruments  like  the harp and the glockenspiel.  ?

         ?  Dynamic  Tube. Like many of Live's effects, it can be  ?
