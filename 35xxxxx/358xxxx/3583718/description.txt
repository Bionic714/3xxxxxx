          | In a new reality where the Soviet Union won the Cold     |
          | War, a fierce conflict is unfolding in America as the    |
          | Red Army invades a vulnerable United States. The player  |
          | takes on the role of an average citizen caught in the    |
          | middle of the conflict as forces take control New York   |
          | City and begin imprisoning innocent Americans, including |
          | the player's brother. With American military forces      |
          | pushed out of New York City, an Underground Resistance   |
          | movement in Manhattan is all that remains to retake      |
          | control of the fallen city. Recruited by the Resistance, |
          | the player will rise through the ranks by successfully   |
          | completing missions with minimal casualties, ultimately  |
          | becoming the charismatic leader of the group. Success    |
          | will largely depend on the player's ability to recruit   |
          | and lead fellow New Yorkers to join in the battle, and   |
          | eventually rescue his sibling and liberate the city. <   |
