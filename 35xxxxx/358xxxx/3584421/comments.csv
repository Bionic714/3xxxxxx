Type: Documentary
Rating: NR
Running Time: 96 Minutes
Directed by: Walon Green
Soundtrack: Stevie Wonder

The thesis of this visually stunning documentary feature is that plants have feelings, too, and that they have a variety of ways of expressing them. Based on the best-selling book by Peter Topkins and Christopher Bird, the custom of talking to one's houseplants is strongly recommended by the filmmakers. Though scientific in tone, the film does not air the opposing view advocated by, perhaps, a majority of scientists. One highlight of the film is its original musical score by Stevie Wonder. ~ Clarke Fountain, All Movie Guide"

,angel25252525,2011-07-20T17:20Z,Thanks quality fine by me I`ve got a poor connection so the smaller and more compressed the torrent the better even if the quality is maybe  a little compromised in the process

,paksirtyn,2012-02-07T21:39Z,"You shouldn't nag about the quality. The original movie was shot with the cheap cameras and was not of great quality. What do you expect from a low budget film? Even so, this is a great movie! Thank you for uploading. Looks good and sounds good. Thanks."
,jiltedw49,2012-04-02T10:39Z,"Awesome upload will seed until I am a zombie... or infected, whatever you want to call those nasty buggers!"
