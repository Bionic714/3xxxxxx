Agnetha performs 6 songs from "Wrap Your Arms Around Me" album.  She is backed by a load of familiar faces including Smokie, and musicians Mats Ronander & Lasse Wellander and Rutger Gunnarsson. Extremely rare liveperfomance for Swedish television 1983. Don't miss this! 


I want to wish everyone here at Pirate bay a happy new year.
Peace and love to all of you from Rosa Mannen.
