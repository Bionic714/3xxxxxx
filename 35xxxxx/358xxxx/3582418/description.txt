Found this on dc++ somewhere, and I personally loved it, so I thought I would share.

Its a Trance/Electro mix by Dutch Dj Patrick Markus, not sure where its been recorded, but I think these are the tracks on the mix:

1  Booka Shade - In White Rooms (Neo Mix)
2  Kupon - Zoom In
3  Deep \\\\\\\'n Pure - Musica d\\\\\\\'Amour
4  Martin Landsky - 1000 Miles
5  Jose Amnesia feat. Jennifer Rene - Louder
6  Patrick Markus - silence & Motion (Tenthu Deep Mix)
7  Dave Spoon - At Night
8  Leama & Moor - Waiting (Patrick Markus Club Mix)
9  Shlomi Aber - Bagpipe
10 Jaytech - Engage
11 Cicada - The Things You Say (Dirty South Remix)

The mix is 60 minutes and the quality is 160 kbps.

Some good stuff here!

Hope you guys like.
