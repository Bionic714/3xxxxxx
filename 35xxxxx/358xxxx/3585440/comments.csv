,=michael=,2006-12-29T06:31Z,"idiotproof67

[V],Kuthumi,2006-12-29T16:08Z,"I hope this is the old black-and-white documentary about one of the most exciting stories of WW2. For us Norwegians who know what really happened, the Kirk Douglas version only sucks. The real guys certainly did not have a luxury cottage where they could live out their romances."
,=michael=,2006-12-29T16:46Z,"Kuthumi
no it is not the black and white documantairy"
[V],Kuthumi,2006-12-31T17:47Z,"Thanks, this is a new BBC documentary where modern guys try to repeat the deeds. Also interviews with the real, old boys. This documentary is briefly described at http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0499247/
The old black-and-white film from 1942 was called ""Kampen om tungtvannet"" (Battle of the Heavy Water) http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0040504/ and clips from it are used in the documentary. By the way, ""Gutta på tur"" made a similar documentary called ""Gutta på Vemork"". Olympic skiing masters Bjørn Dæhlie and Vegard Ulvang really had to struggle!"
,=michael=,2007-01-03T16:03Z,"Where are the seeders?????

,ffxiftw,2007-02-07T18:44Z,"First of all great documentary, thank you for sharing Micheal. This documentary is though to find.

Ive been sharing this documentary for quite some days now and it seems when people get what they want, they stop sharing.  

To Leeches out there...
Whats the idea of file sharing if you guys out there don't share.   

Thank you^^"
