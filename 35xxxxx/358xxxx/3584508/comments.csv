Winrar doesn't recognise this format."
,Schlimmy,2007-01-02T21:36Z,But how to extract? There are 22 setup files. Thx for advising!
,Schlimmy,2007-01-04T23:27Z,"I did. Then what?
I might still sound ignorant but I'm working on it.
Thanks again!"
,yxzie,2007-01-05T01:55Z,"WinRar of ""old"" versions accepts a sequence of files named as;
*.rar, *.r01, *.r02, *.r03 and so on - up to *.r99

This is also true for the newer WinRar versions, but they also have a more relaxed style available - which apparantly has been used here.

Rename the files as indicated above and you will probably have it work.

The cygwin/Linux bash shell command sequence to do this is:

for (( i=2; i"

,timpirate,2007-01-18T01:45Z,"Can't rename these files. I try to give it the r00 and r01 and such but an error msg comes up that says, ""Cannot rename Setup: It is being used by another person or program. Close any programs that might be using this program and try again.""

Help, please?"

,maticony,2007-01-19T12:26Z,"Can any of you get the ""Create Bootable Rescue Media"" function to work ? 

Nothing happens when i click on it. Any ideas ?"
,Truvbay,2007-01-24T01:38Z,"Even easier way: JUST rename setup.001 to setup.r00 .
 Extract that file. When it wants you to find the next file in the series, point it to setup.002 .
WinRAR is then smart enough to do the rest, which is great, but shame on the uploader for making it so difficult."
