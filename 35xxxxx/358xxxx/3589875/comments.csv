,neslesman,2007-01-05T01:56Z,"Listen folks, I'm trying to create and upload my first torrent.  I've created a torrent and pointed it to where the file is but I don't know how to get it to TPB.  If someone could give me a quicky tutorial or point me in the right direction I've got 3 Jeppesen Videos here with 10 hours of great instrumentation instruction from beginner to commercial.  3 files of 15 gb total but I'll break them into 3 torrents.

I've got some other good stuff for a later day.  It's time for me to start contributing to the great stuff here.
"
,neslesman,2007-01-05T02:01Z,"further to the above, is this the tracker thingee that I enter when I create the torrent?

http://tpb.tracker.thepiratebay.org"
,Dr. Frikadel,2007-01-05T02:22Z,"Okay quicky: 
1. zip the file and give it appropriate name
2. with your torrentc client select ""make new torrent"" or something alike
3. point and select to the zip file you just made
4. in the dialog screen you need to enter ""http://tpb.tracker.thepiratebay.org/announce ""
5 make the  torrent. The client will now upload but you're not finished..
6. Go to http://thepiratebay.org and after logging in choose ""upload file""
7. make an appropriate description and title (FS2004 - Title)
8. Point to the torrent file on your comp.
9. Enter code from image
10. Choose ""upload""
11. No KEEP SEEDING so no closing the torrent client program
11 Seed...and make people happy

[T],stevekasian,2007-01-05T02:25Z,"Yes, it is the correct tracker info.

And to some this may sound like a dumbass thing for me to say to you, but you must also understand that you will have to keep a constant data stream coming from your computer to the tracker in order for everyone (or at least SOMEONE) to get a full copy. That means that it's gonna take a few days if not weeks to transfer all that data. You are the ""seed"" until someone else downloads ALL of the data FROM YOU, at which time THEY become a ""seed"" as well. You can at that time elect to remain a seeder to help out the stream (because your stream will combine with every other person connected to the torrent) or discontinue seeding and leave it up to the goodwill of everyone else who's been able to get 100% of the file from you to continue seeding until enough people get 100% of it, at which time they can elect to do the same, etc,etc,etc...

But you MUST understand, if you don't upload long enough (and at a fast enough rate!!) for at least somebody out there to obtain a full copy, you'll be fuckin' everybody with a gimp torrent... and that ain't cool.

So if you don't have the time, bandwidth and dedication to complete the circle, don't EVER upload a torrent!

Good luck.

,neslesman,2007-01-05T02:26Z,"thanks doc, it looks like I got it right except I forgot to zip the damned file.  Lets see if I can get it zipped then I'll re do it.
Thax"
,neslesman,2007-01-05T02:29Z,"Yea I understand the seed part and 5 gb are going to take a while at 60 kb but ya gotta start somewhere.  I can run it for about 16 hrs/day as long as it takes.  I don't have any problem seeding a long time, my seed ratio is almost 2 to 1 for my download stuff."
[T],stevekasian,2007-01-05T02:29Z,"...and btw, please disregard my comment about that being the correct tracker URL. :-p

The good Dr. has posted the correct URL. :-)

,Dr. Frikadel,2007-01-05T02:34Z,"mmm....it's a bit slow with 0.2kb/s :)
