Genre: Turn-based Strategy

Requires Dark_Alexs firmware 302OE-B google it if you don't know what it is.


Notes: Works with minor slow down and still has the problems that was inherent in original game.
Done with PsGUI123beta which I've added in case you didn't like  what I added so you can customize it yourself. it claims it will also pull the image from the pbp. not sure how well but thats what it claims.

If you've never heard of X-com google it. It rocks trust me. unless you despise turn based games I highly recommend it.


please seed as much as you can.
