,little_beagle,2006-12-20T15:24Z,this is the real deal as far as i can see I've watched the intro definitely seems like e16.
,chris j,2006-12-20T18:51Z,thx for this.....CAN ANYONE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD TELL ME WHY I CANT FIND A TORRENT FOR EPISODE 14?!?!?!?!?!?!?!
,Devinius977,2006-12-20T20:15Z,yeah.... I forgot to say I was thinking about SG-1 :)...heh. 
,deakstarkiller,2006-12-20T20:33Z,"@chris j

""thx for this.....CAN ANYONE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD TELL ME WHY I CANT FIND A TORRENT FOR EPISODE 14?!?!?!?!?!?!?!""

I read in another forum that episode 14 won't air until later. Don't remember why, though.
But anyway, don't spend your time looking for it just yet."
,macbrush,2006-12-20T23:16Z,"E14 doesn't exists. All E14 I found on the net were either E15, or password protected file which require you to download spyware or trojans like netpumper!

Someone said they put E15 on when they supposed to show E14, no explaination was given."
,chris j,2006-12-20T23:49Z,hmmm strange one indeed...thx for the info folks :)
,luisgate,2006-12-21T00:27Z,"Devinius977, if you are talking about Stargate SG1. You can download seasons 1 to 9 in:
http://undergroundtorrents.org.ru/tracker/index.php

IÂ´m downloading all seasons from the torrents of that site.
The uploader name of those seasons is hanen87."
,DanPainter,2006-12-21T04:05Z,"Is underground just a TV,Anime torrent site?"
,luisgate,2006-12-21T05:05Z,Yes it is DanPainter.
,EarlHare,2006-12-21T11:13Z,"Firstly, this torrent is episode 15, great job with the mis-information!

Secondly:
""Production Number & Airing Sequence are sometimes different. The Ark was
filmed after Tao of Rodney because they couldn't build the Ark in time.
Production Number is the order of which the episodes were filmed in.

Airing Sequence is the actual order that it's aired. Sci-Fi does not need to
air it for us to know the airing sequence.

Movie Central bought the airing rights for SGA. Therefore, they are airing the
episodes in order.""

I found that after 5 minutes with a google search, you guys should try using it sometime, very useful :)"
,DanPainter,2006-12-21T11:49Z,Then what episode is The Return part 2?
,RivieraDude,2006-12-21T12:49Z,"but beware , there is two different episode 15 floating about, 'Tao of Rodney' and 'The Game', guess the non aired episode 14 have fubared the episode numbering somewhat. =)"
,DanPainter,2006-12-21T22:25Z,Episode 14 should be called the Return part 2 shouldn't it?
,Devinius977,2006-12-22T03:57Z,"THNX luisgate!!!!!
:))
the site is fantastic!  I got them all.
thnx again"
,dicda,2006-12-22T19:32Z,"has anybody seen episode 14?? i cannot find it. 

thx"
,mnbrtg,2006-12-23T16:05Z,"From tv.com; notes on s03e14: This is actually episode 16 of season 3. The production number makes it seem like this is episode 14 as it was filmed out of order, but will be aired as episode 16. Production episode 15 then becomes episode 14 and similarly production episode 16 becomes episode 15."
