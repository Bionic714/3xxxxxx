,kvanum,2007-01-03T17:01Z,"you can see it, but it wont be in full hd quality. so you would be better off with a xvid or dvd version."
,leecher71,2007-01-09T17:53Z,Does this work with VLC? Is it really 1080i?
,Fintelvoodel,2007-01-11T15:27Z,"You need a powerful CPU to decode H.264, my P4 1.6 GHz can' do it. Core2Duo is recommended.

VLC will play this fine, or WMP with CoreAVC codecs installed. Btw this movie has 8 soundtracks, 4 chinese and 4 english!"
,rush.chevsky,2007-01-24T07:03Z,Why don't the 10 files add up to 7.2GB?
,Benjamaaan,2007-01-25T12:14Z,How do i burn it? My DVD can take HD-cdÂ´s...
,AIMBOT,2007-04-18T14:50Z,"This only plays a Chinese soundtrack for me, using PWR DVD 7.3 or WMP ( with the CoreAVC codec)... No Language selection menus show in either of the two players."
,AIMBOT,2007-04-18T17:41Z,VLC player (0.8.6a) works  and shows all the audio tracks ! Now I just need to join the two .TS files somehow ...
