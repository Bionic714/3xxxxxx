StarCraft: Retribution (Authorized Expansion)

Not sure if anyone wants this old thing, but in the event that someone does, here you go.  This is NOT the Brood War expansion, but rather a very rare expansion that was authorized by Blizzard and released by WizardWorks (ironically the creators of the Deer Hunter series).

Installation Note: For some reason the expansion will not install to my non default StarCraft directory, but maybe it is because the installer cannot 'see' StarCraft anymore due to its extensive patching since the expansion's release.  However, when I tried to install the expansion with a default directory installation of StarCraft with no patches outside of those accompanying the Brood War expansion, I had no troubles.
