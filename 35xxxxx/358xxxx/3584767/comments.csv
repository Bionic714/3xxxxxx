,simplem,2006-12-27T17:49Z,"Ups...i just saw the file name - international, sorry for double post and thanks again story!"
,dvdfreak,2006-12-28T14:52Z,Would be *very* nice if someone would upload the finnish one as well! It is one of the most sold games in the country.

,Omegafrog,2006-12-30T21:28Z,"i am sorry for stupid questions i have used many game torrents but only for my pc  never for my ps2    so i have some questions i hope some of you can answer for me 
1 do u need a mod chip or anything to play the game?
2 how do i burn it on a disk so ps2 can read it? (please be specific on this one ^_^)
thanks for helping guys "
,nenikoj,2006-12-31T00:26Z,Yes you need a chip. Burn it with Dvd decrypt. That work´s for me.
,fidofido,2006-12-31T01:45Z,"Yes, mod chip is a neccesity, then you will also be able to play both pal and ntsc versions.

the mod chip is worth every cent.  But, don't try to install it yourself. it is fucking confusing and hard to do and you can screw up the entire console.  spend the little extra dough and have someone do it who knows what they are doing."
,fidofido,2006-12-31T01:50Z,"oy, the second part of your question. Unpack it and extract it to a file so you have an iso image. use winrar to do this.

Once you have the image, use ""burn image"" in nero, change the file reader in nero to ""read all files"" then simply burn the image onto a dvd.  But, you can make no use of the disks unless you get the mod chip.

,Royvedas,2007-01-01T19:03Z,"Yes - endelig. Nu mangler vi bare den danske version, eller måske den finske - blot på grund af Lordi - Hard Rock Halleluja."
,peppesbordega,2007-01-11T22:03Z,"Jag har ett problem med att det ofta hänger sig. Låtarna spelas inte när man ska välja låt och när man gör det så blir bilden vit och inget händer.

Vad kan felet bero på? Har fler detta problem?"
,fuckgoogle,2007-01-17T15:52Z,PLZ seed som STORY !! // FUCKGOOGLE
,fuckgoogle,2007-01-17T18:42Z,"plzz little more, it's only 24kbit ! ;D"
,latino77,2007-02-08T21:26Z,"Can someone release ""Singstar Rocks""
It´s been out some time but it´s not in piratebay =("
,robke112,2007-02-25T13:21Z,Omegafrog: You do not actually have to modchip your ps2. There is an exploit available that can be installed on your memorycard only. Google for cogswap. This way you will not have to actually fiddle with the ps2 itself.
,Zandie,2007-03-20T21:36Z,"Tack! Funkar kanon! Saknar Singstar Rock, någon som har?"
,piratejack69,2007-04-14T22:25Z,"Stupid question time.....

Are the words all in swedish?"
,peppesbordega,2007-05-19T12:42Z,"Ni som har denna torrent, fungerar den verkligen? Fryser inte spelet för er?"
,uNderdog84,2008-01-20T17:31Z,"Hmmm, 58 seeders and coming 66,2kbit/s"
,rickjeweetwelwelke,2008-02-26T20:28Z,would be *very* nice if someone would seed...
,toshineon,2011-10-27T23:49Z,"Najs, har letat efter det här spelet. Finns det nån som kan ladda up Singstar: Kent också? Hittar inte det någonstans :s"
