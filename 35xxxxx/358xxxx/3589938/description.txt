A Live Linux expressed as a screensaver for Microsoft Windows.

The original comes from http://knopper.net/ ; this version you can 'autoplay' under Windows by putting the DVD in; you can install as a screensaver in the usual way; or you can tell your computer to 'boot' from the DVD and then it runs the way Klaus Knopper intended it to.

To end the screensaver version, Ctrl-Alt-F and click on the red X.
