,Quirky_Puppy,2007-01-19T17:28Z,"Quick question, is this in .iso or .img format please?"
,C_Duck,2007-01-23T22:44Z,"This is not an image file. It's just the vob, ifo and bup files, ready to burn with your favorite dvd burning software."
,Quirky_Puppy,2007-02-02T13:35Z,"C_Duck, you are my fraking hero!

Quick note to everyone, I've now downloaded all four of the disks he's uploaded, and they are perfect. DVD quality, faultless sound and in a nice easy disk image format.

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

Now all we need is someone to upload season 2! ;)"
,Quirky_Puppy,2007-02-02T13:36Z,"Oh yeah, sorry. It's not disk image.

It's a VIDEO_TS folder (I was getting it confused with something else I just downloaded)

Easy to stick on a disk, I used DVD Shrink."
,Deer-Hunter,2007-03-05T21:48Z,is this a good verision to have on the computer?
,maew4,2007-05-18T14:04Z,Please seed. Noone is seeding disc 1 & 3 for season 1. Even disc 2 and 4 have very poor seeding.
