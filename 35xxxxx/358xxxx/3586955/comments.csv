The Brothers Grimm SiLU from HDTV China worked fine for me, but this one gives me a 'channel not found' error in HDTVtoMPEG2.exe and SVCD2DVDv2DEMO.msi crashes repeatedly. Can anyone give me any pointers? I don't yet have a PC that can fluidly play 1080i, that's why I'd like to convert this for now."

,myulk666,2007-04-29T09:48Z,"IÂ´m experiencing the same problem as bbig119. Is there anyone out there who have got this movie working properly, and which player did you use?!"
,PriMo222,2007-06-08T19:09Z,"Use KMPlayer, it plays almost anything and is much better then VLC."
,Snurre__,2007-06-18T20:47Z,"Yes I can confirm that KMPlayer can play this movie, how ever the video audio is off sync (Delay between audio and video)
