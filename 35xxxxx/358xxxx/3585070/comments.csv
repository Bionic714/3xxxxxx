,whoamitoyou,2007-01-19T04:01Z,You open command by pressing 'Esc' key.  You load bots by typing 'bot_add_ct' or 'bot_add_t'.  You overide steam problem by deleting the 'steam.dll' file from the 'Counter-Strike Source' directory.
,whoamitoyou,2007-01-19T04:05Z,You must copy the 'Patch.exe' file from the 'Crack' folder on the disc or .iso file.  Paste it into the 'Counter-Strike Source' folder and run the patch.  It will ask for a steam account id and password.  Use your free existing one or create one.  You open command by pressing 'Esc' key.  You load bots by typing 'bot_add_ct' or 'bot_add_t'.  You overide steam problem by deleting the 'steam.dll' file from the 'Counter-Strike Source' directory.

,RiSHBH,2009-07-30T07:43Z,"hey, is this real Counter Strike Source???

This size is so small.

If this is Real CSS and a working game-- I will
only say one thing



C'mon PPL Seed!!!!!!!!!"
,RiSHBH,2009-08-03T08:43Z,"This is REAL!!!

Counter Strike Source 

Supports both online and offline play

IF you want to play offline,

add these commands in console

bot_chatter normal
bot_add

bot_add command adds a bot in the game to
play, bot_chatter normal makes bots to talk like usual (or they will talk using radio)

INSTALLING GAME TAKE ALOT OF TIME

after installation, delete steam.dll

Patching is not necessary.

THIS GAME IS REALLY GOOD!!

FINEST GRAPHICS.

I'll say only two things.
1. bots are not too clever unlike condition zero
2. Seed!!!!"
,RiSHBH,2009-09-04T10:45Z,"If you are unsure to download this torrent,read this
this is the real Counter strike source
1. download the file
2. Open it with winrar or mount the image using nero image drive, alcohol 120% or deamon tools
3. Install the game
4. Open the game folder
5. Delete steam.dll
6. Open Cstrike.exe
7. Add these commands in console
(i) bind i ""sv_cheats 1; bot_chatter normal""
(ii) bind p ""bot_add""
8. Now create a server
9. Press i and the press p if you want to add a bot
happy gaming"
