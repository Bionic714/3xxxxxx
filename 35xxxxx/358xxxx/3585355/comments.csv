Not that fucking long ago, screencap previews were not even fucking available, you HAD to get it to see it. You people have all become so used to a luxury you can't even think back 6 months in time. Stop your whining."

There has *always* been the option for the uploader to post a link to a preview screen.
Shoey1964 seems to have just decided to say 'fuck it' and go  back to spamming for vipersden instead of offering a public link to imagefap as he used to. Even on Usenet, uploaders have always provided screencaps so no one had to waste their time downloading an entire movie file only to delete it upon discovering it was really crap. There are so many free image hosting sites today there's simply no excuse for not offering caps or at the very least a good, verbose description of the content (who, what, when, where, etc.)."
