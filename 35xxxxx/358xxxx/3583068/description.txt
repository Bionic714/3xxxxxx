I was fortunate enough to find this rare gem at a defunct video store that was selling all of its old VHS tapes.  BY FAR this is the GREATEST comedy I've ever seen.  It has been released under a different name as well...  "American Raspberry"...  Somebody took over the TV airwaves and broadcast their own funny shows and commercials.  This movie goes too far.  It is GREAT!  This movie pokes fun at Puerto Ricans, Gays, Cripples, People from India, Pro-Lifers, Tree Huggers, Charles Whitman,  the Catholic Church, Slaves, Hungry Children, and many many others.  If you liked Kentucky Fried Movie, you'll LOVE Prime Time.  I just ripped this one tonight from my VHS tape.  If you enjoy the dry humor of the '70s, please download this movie.  I am going to be seeding it for a while until it catches on.  ENJOY!
