,Mick Jagger,2006-12-29T08:49Z,"Yes they were rock's greatest pioneers ahead of their time. Sure they used other people's songs, they also included credis on many of thos direct copies, memphis minnie and willie dixon, and the estates there of to this day get royalties from Led Zeppelin publishing.

The fact is, if they had not taken old songs nobody at that time gave a shit about and reworked them into the electric magic that only Led Zeppelin are capable of, those songs would have been lost in the mists of time forever.

Rather than use a twisted sense of hindsite to criticise, look with a true historian's eye at what else was going on at the time Led Zeppelin were making those records. It's very obvious to a true musicologist that Led Zeppelin were indeed decades ahead of their time. Their time has probably not even come yet."
[T],tmax666,2006-12-30T01:08Z,Led Who?
,alcocops,2006-12-30T02:55Z,"How DARE Jimmy Page plaigiarize the New Yardbirds! Didn't know Led Zep had recorded 'She Moves Through The Fair' but if so, why illustrate the fact by including Hayley Westenra's version? I doubt she was even born when Zeppelin broke up . . . "
,freaktmp,2006-12-30T15:49Z,"Another display of ignorance and malice by UnclePaul. Most of the songs here were correctly credited to the original creators, either immediately or after litigation. 

Babe I'm Gonna Leave You - After litigation it has been credited to ""Bredon/Page/Plant""

You Shook Me - It is correctly credited to ""Dixon/Lenoir""

Dazed And Confused - Influenced by the Jake Holmes tune with the same name. 

Black Waterside - Black Mountain Side: based on a traditional song. If the changes merit a Zep credit or not, it's up to you. I think they do.

I Can't Quit You Baby - Correctly credited to Dixon

You Need Love - Whole Lotta Love: partly based on ""You Need Love"" by Willie Dixon. After litigation from the original artist he was given part credit.

Killing Floor - The Lemon Song: partly based on ""Killing floor"" by Howlin' Wolf. After litigation from the original artist he was given part credit.

Bring It On Home - Correctly credited to Dixon/Page/Plant

Taurus - Stairway To Heaven: the intro is influenced by the Spirit tune. Definitely not enough to merit a credit!

In My Time Of Dying - Partly influenced by ""Jesus Make Up My Dying Bed"" by Blind Willie Johnson. Definitely not enough to merit a credit!

Traveling Riverside Blues - Is correctly credited to Robert Johnson


This is not even a Led Zeppelin song:
She Moves Through The Fair - White Summer (The Yardbirds): Traditional Irish song. Jimmy Page later acknowledged Davey Graham's arrangements (She Moved Through The Bizarre).


These are the only songs still wrongfully credited to Led Zeppelin:

Nobody's Fault But Mine - Derived from the Blind Willie Johnson tune and incorrectly credited.

How Many More Years - Howlin' Wolf & The Hunter - Albert King: How Many More Times is partly influenced by these tunes and incorrectly credited."
,gyjkgjfljeg,2007-01-01T11:44Z,"Guys, Led Zeppelin = The New Yardbirds.

It's The Yardbirds that they supposedly 'plagiarized' music from, but even that's all stuff that Jimmy Page had the rights to (and even wrote).


Oh--
UnclePaul, mate,


Shut the fuck up."
,LordV8r,2007-01-30T07:06Z,Wow... Before you go and start calling Jimmy Page and Zeppelin thieves look up your shit..... The New Yardbirds is what they came up with for a name for Zeppelin before they came up with Zeppelin you dumb fuck...
,afro2000,2007-02-07T16:34Z,"There's nothing new about reworking old/ traditional songs, now we call them cover tunes. The songs you claim Zeppelin was ripping off came from a tradition of being passed down and reinterpreted through the generations. I don't think they ever claimed to be the original writers of these songs anyways (although they were not properly credited.)

Nevertheless, I find it interesting to present these tracks in this way. Makes for an interesting and educational listen."
,D45k10r,2007-05-03T01:31Z,ur all fucking stupid
,Armstrong14,2008-02-05T01:32Z,They're all great songs.  I just learned of Spirit's Taurus and how it influenced Stairway To Heaven.  They did take the tune...  And changed it around to make it a legend relive a masterpiece.
,kissfreak13x,2008-03-08T16:56Z,SEED PLEASE?!?!
,jimmybeam,2008-04-01T20:52Z,unclepaul you couldn't hold a candle next to any zeppelin member so stop hating. you gonna release all of elvis songs the same way(along with countless other famous bands)
,mucky37,2008-05-07T15:42Z,"Okay now the first one Babe I'm Gonna Leave You: this was wrongly acknowledged not by LedZep, but by Joan Baez, who on her earlier album credited it as a traditional number. Zep simply believed Baez's incorrect attribution. 

UnclePaul, don't let the truth get in the way of what you want to believe. But thanks for the upload, most interesting. "
,GOYA551,2008-05-16T08:53Z,"You left out ""When the Levee Breaks"" and probably some others."
