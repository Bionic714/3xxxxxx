,TheMasterE,2007-07-01T18:11Z,Hey how do I access the samples? I've downloaded the torrent but theyre all saved as different formats such as .NRG.  What program do I use to access them? Thanks
,risken,2007-07-09T14:26Z,"Common, please seed! I dont blaim Dashy! This torrent has been downloaded 670 times! but only one seeding???!! (probably Dashy)....  Hey this community is not about leeching from one user than dash... you have to help seeding the file, at least 1:1 ratio... Common piratebay users, behave!"
,DJ_LG,2007-08-31T01:49Z,Please continue seed!
,artytorrent,2007-10-17T23:44Z,Does this pack contain WAVs? I'm not going to download and seed if the files are Mac only as NRG.
,artytorrent,2007-10-18T01:56Z,"""Vengeance Effects Vol 1.nrg"" is a Mac drive image. 
Vengeance Ultimate Bass ""VUB.bin"" should mount or burn easily however, as the cue file is included.
I have enough FX already, but I everyone needs more BASS!
Thanks for sharing! :D"

the .nrg files can be opened with nero burning rom..."
