,duder1,2006-12-31T17:41Z,yes.  you'll just have to play around with the settings to get the trhottle to work but it does work.
,duder1,2006-12-31T17:49Z,"By the way, this game only works with either a joystick or with an RC type radio ( hxxp://www2.towerhobbies.com/cgi-bin/wti0093p?&C=ZHA )  This game will NOT work with just keyboard alone"

,xiIix,2008-09-11T00:50Z,"I would assume you did not use the crack, which is why it's still looking for the USB dongle."
,ganomia,2008-11-24T16:20Z,"These are NOT the add-on models!!!

These are custom free download models - AND they are not even in their original installer apps or archives-so sound files are missing etc., unless you get the app rar as well I would guess.

Not the best package out there... obviously mis-titled, but heh, if it works for you...."
,UglyPilot,2009-01-01T01:44Z,What kind of joystick does it support? Will any USB joystick do? I have crapbox 360 controller for windows (usb) and wondering if it works or not.
,UglyPilot,2009-01-02T08:10Z,"I just tried, it works."
