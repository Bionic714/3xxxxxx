Thanks and kudos to Elizabeth S. and Pamela B. for the \"leak\"... sorry, I just had to seed this...

Personally if this one comes out I think it would be too bulky for my taste.  But I suppose the design firm (one of many Apple commissioned) wanted it to still look like the iPod Video (when folded).  Then again, its hard to cram a 3G phone (with front and back cameras) and a full-featured MP3 player in a smaller iPod-nano package.
