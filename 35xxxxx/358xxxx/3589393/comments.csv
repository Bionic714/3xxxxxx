I don't get it!? Why tease us with this torrent if you aint gonna seed it? Doesn't make much sense! Why the trouble of making this torrent and then just leaving us stuck on 16%?"

,Kakash,2007-04-28T23:04Z,What the fuck mean the episodes download theme self with 187 kb/s until 23% or 68% and thene stops to 0kb/s  what the fuck is this if enywone knows pls tell me 
,Erasmius,2007-04-29T23:03Z,"Well, torrents are shared on p2ps by means of sending pieces of the file to others interested in the file.  You start off distributing the torrent from the torrent's maker, and then everyone leeches off of the distributor until enough people get the completed version of the file.  Well, in short, it seems like the people with the completed version of the file left as soon as they could to enjoy the file (I don't blame 'em) and we're stuck with...around 60%.  Lame, but true."
