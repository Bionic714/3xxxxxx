,thesoftparade,2008-09-20T02:43Z,"Really great upload! Thank you very much.

However, it is extremely annoying that every album is just one big track.  "
,Promteam,2008-10-15T15:41Z,"I do not understand what the problem is, One big track is what must be, IT IS A  MIX . 
if you want to get songs so it is not for you.
Euro Adrenaline is the best of the best.
thanks alot!"
,natria,2009-01-30T23:11Z,Thank you for this music.
,thesoftparade,2009-02-14T21:53Z,"I understand it's a mix and it's very good but there should be a cut after every song because if you don't like exactly every song from the mix it's really good if you can skip to your favorite, especially if you're smashed or high. 

There is software to do this and that?s exactly what I've done. But I'm just saying, it's better with a cut now and then so you can skip what you don't like, whatever it's a mix or an album. Don't get me wrong, I really appreciate what the uploader has done and it's absolutely amazing.

Thank you very much once again!"
