,lougrasn,2007-01-04T18:29Z,"not a virus not a trojan.
checked with kaspersky,avg antispyware,spyware doctor,steganos antispyware."
,oldiesguy8898,2007-01-11T19:55Z,"This DOES NOT WORK. Lisencese have already been disabled. Plus, when you try to start the program unregistered, your computer shuts down. What a piece of shit."
,lougrasn,2007-01-14T13:06Z,it works. don't install the firewall and antivirus that comes with system mechanic and disable updates.if you download updates the serial will get blacklisted
,sniggol,2007-02-18T04:01Z,"So if the antivirus and firewall don't work, then what the heck good is this program??? A lot of other programs are here on piratebay that do the mechanic stuff. Don't bother messing with this."
,gwilli33,2007-06-26T14:30Z,"system mechanic 7.0 SUCKS!!!! My computer did nothing but reboot itself with that garbage program on it. Now that I uninstalled it, everything is running fine. Forbes report on 7.0 is not any better, they actually call it junk."
