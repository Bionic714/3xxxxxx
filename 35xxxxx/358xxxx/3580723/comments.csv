,Miguel28,2006-12-21T23:18Z,"Again, keep seeding this torrent while it only gets to 99.7%. The rest is here in this post:

,Miguel28,2006-12-21T23:37Z,"Please, someone do me a favor: play one of the tracks that it's incomplete on this torrent and tell me if it goes to the end, i think probably the torrent it's complete though it's stuck on 99.7%... give me some feedback please"
,majtymicke,2006-12-22T19:19Z,"Yes it seems to be that way.
So for everyone that didnt understand the instructions here it is again.

When you get to 99,7% you have all this torrent can give you, but there are some tracks on vol 15 that are incomplete (thats why we wont get to 100%)
So then download those songs again from the link that Miguel provided us with.

Thats it. "
,affekopp,2006-12-22T20:51Z,"Well, I reached 99,7 % but my tracklist says:

Volume 10 / Track 10  = 80 %
Volume 13 / Track 11  = 75 %
Volume 14 / Track 10  = 75 %
Volume 14 / Track 11  = 66 %
Volume 14 / Track 14  = 75 %
Volume 14 / Track 15  = 66 %
Volume 14 / Track 24  = 75 %

plus the 3 incomplete songs from CD 15 which you have already re-posted. Maybe you should check your HDD or try Azureus for creating your torrents. Because after two corrupt torrents there seems to be something wrong. But anyway, thanks for sharing your treasures. I'll keep seeding."
,majtymicke,2006-12-23T00:46Z,"Those tracks end the way they should fine for me.
I tried those that you had listed."
,affekopp,2006-12-23T07:02Z,"Thanks for checking. But some of the incomplete files have missing parts or skips. Not at the ends but in the song. 
I.e. the ""Sweet Caroline"" version on Disc 13/Track 11 or ""Never Say Yes"" on Disc 14/Track 15. Torrents don't load from start to end. They load data-packages. So sometimes you have gaps or a mix-up of two songs in one track until it finished and sorts the packages. But you are right. The other tracks seem to be okay."
,Miguel28,2006-12-23T10:50Z,"What is funny is that after a re-check of the torrent, i miss those tracks on vol. 15 too, even though they're complete on my hard disk.
From what i read in web, this can happen with other app too. Think is a problem with super-seeding, from now on, i'll turn off that SS mode."
,majtymicke,2006-12-23T13:24Z,"Miguel, will you upload those tracks again also so we can get them all 100%
Thank you for clearing that up for me affekopp =)"
,majtymicke,2006-12-23T13:26Z,"Disc 13/Track 11 or ""Never Say Yes"" on Disc 14/Track 15"
,Miguel28,2006-12-23T14:03Z,"Ok, it's up
