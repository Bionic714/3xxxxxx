,bugg123,2006-12-30T18:39Z,Brilliant! I'll continue to seed these once I'm done so you can put all the others up!
,flobadon,2006-12-31T16:26Z,Seems the original seeder is not connected currently -- leechers are stuck at 33.5%.
,DeputyDave,2007-01-01T07:13Z,"Dumb question, but what are you using to burn these to DVD? i can't seem to pull it off."
,UMe2,2007-01-01T17:07Z,"I'm having some trouble with my router lately. It stops forwarding ports every now and then. A hard reset is made automatically every day at 0820 UTC/GMT by interrupting power for 15 minutes. Since I am 200 miles away from it until 3rd January, I won't be able to  replace the router with a new one I bought some days ago before the 3rd Jan. Hang on..."
,krum,2007-01-02T09:48Z,"Thanks a lot for these UMe2, such a pain in the ass getting hold of older episodes. Keep up the great work."

,netizencain,2007-01-06T02:09Z,I'm grabbing these now and will seed only MST3K for the next few months.  UMe2: Thanks for the great upload.  A big undertaking but well worth it for MST3K fans.
,woodpusher69,2007-01-09T05:54Z,Thx so much. I can finally watch MST3K on my T.V. Great work! Too bad there are so few seeders. Will do my part.
,aeonphlux,2007-01-09T06:49Z,"Holy crap. Will you marry me?  :D
Keep 'em coming, I'll seed as long as I can..."
