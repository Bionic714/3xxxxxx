jerry popperq:  I'm not sure what your taste in movies is, but if you like comedy, you should definately watch Kopps (it's like a Swedish version of Supertroopers).  There's a teen drama with an English Title called ""Show Me Love"" which won a bunch of awards about 10 years back.  One called ""Miffo"" is pretty good if I remember.  There are some great older movies too like ""A Swedish Love Story"" (English title) made in 1969 or so.  ""My Life as a Dog"" is great.  ""Angel Farm"" is pretty good, there's a less good sequel too.  The old Ingmar Bergman movies are awesome too, though strange and dark - ""The Seventh Seal"", etc.  Anyway, hope that helps."
