,inetcrimes,2006-12-28T14:00Z,"OK This is what you do, its very easy.

on your memory stick you should see 3 files

1.MEMSTICK.IND
2.MSTK_PRO.IND
3.PSP (Folder)

now that is all in the root dir of the memory stick.

You need to make another folder in the root dir with thos others called

MP_ROOT

Once you have made that open it up and create another folder called 

100MNV01

place all of the movies in that folder this is all you have to do no moding of any sort just make sure you get the file names right or it will not work."

so u need any emulators 
if what it is it?

p.s jus got a psp and need help"
,inetcrimes,2007-01-02T02:11Z,"WoW!


okay do what i said above the only file you need to put in the folder is the mp4 file (the movie)

you do know you need to have a memory stick large enough to hold the movie you wish to play and also have access to the memory stick via computer card reader or usb cable 

I posted the directions above but ill do it again ...
