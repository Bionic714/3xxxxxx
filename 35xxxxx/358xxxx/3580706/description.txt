Chet Baker's 1983 Swedish tour captures the trumpeter going through the motions -- extraordinary motions. The groove he got into in the 1980s in Europe found him performing excellent concert after excellent concert in places like Paris, Bologna and here in Gothenburg. Chet sings on My Ideal and But Not for Me and cooks up some compelling understated solos, too. To the casual fan this will sound like any old Chet Baker live record. For the afficionado it will reveal another facet of his sound and evolution, the tragic and the sublime.
