,drifter7508,2006-12-26T12:05Z,"""Miroslav Philharmonik will include more than 1,300 orchestral and choir sounds and over 7GB of sample material on 2 DVDs.""

15,48 mb?.... yeah sure.. lol"
[T],funkiez,2007-01-02T16:00Z,"how about u guys first go learn the difference between rip and ISO. and THEN, maybe come back bitching about it... :)"
,teh_dudezorz,2007-01-02T21:04Z,"Okay, so this is the main program itself. I see you've uploaded the first DVD, too.

Is this whole thing fake, or virus-y, or anything like that?

'Cause if it's working perfectly, I'm gonna start worshiping you dude! I've been wanting to get my hands on Miroslav for a while now..."
[T],funkiez,2007-01-02T22:12Z,"teh_dudezorz, there is no viruses. and no, i have not uploaded the DVD. it was someone else. i'm waiting some proper (complete) release of the soundbanks."
,teh_dudezorz,2007-01-03T17:24Z,"Okay, cool. I hope that guy's gonna upload the other DVD also. I'm kinda excited now..."
,teh_dudezorz,2007-01-03T17:57Z,"Right; I've finished downloading, and the keygen seems to be really suspicious. I've checked it with Avast, and it says the file's clean.

BUT... It's 23kb, and has no icon: these are the typical attributes of a trojan that sends unwanted phone-calls through your modem for HUGE prices. This thing might not be it, but it's just... too suspicious. I'm not gonna use it until someone else who downloaded it assures me of its cleanness.

Maybe I'm a bit too paranoid, but I don't want any mess."
,teh_dudezorz,2007-01-03T21:18Z,"Alright, IGNORE WHAT I SAID! This thing is working PERFECTLY! Go download it with that DVD! Oh, and thanks very, very much, funkiez!"
,lomega,2007-01-05T00:51Z,"How do i find the DVD you're talking about? ive downloaded it and installed it, it's just missing the banks..  I can't wait to use it, just got a new midi controller and i'm jonesin for some good sounds.  Please let me know, any help will be much appreciated

thanks in advance!"

,jam543,2007-01-22T01:07Z,how do you open this darn thing. i am anxious to get it up and running. i have 5 rar files and its saying i have a certain volume to extract...please help me!
,jam543,2007-01-23T16:26Z,I was able to open in win xp but not in osx. has anyone else had this problem? any suggestions?
,Leslie_lizzard,2007-01-28T22:36Z,Where do I find the digital ID? 
,hatchetface,2007-02-01T03:19Z,"I unpack the 4 rar files and get a 5th rar that (supposedly) contains the exe. When I try to unrar this 5th file, it asks me to browse to B-MirPhi.part02.rar, which doesn't exist in this download.

How exactly did you guys get this to work with a missing file?"
,hatchetface,2007-02-01T03:24Z,"That's... bizarre.
I un-rar'd the in a different way (same app, winrar) by just right-clicking and dragging to extract and now it doesn't ask me for the second, non-existant file. No idea how this was packed, but it was odd. Danke."
,pursevere,2007-03-23T06:57Z,I dont know what to put on digital id
,andolatut,2007-09-27T00:15Z,"Detta verkar ju va fantastiskt! Men...
Jag har laddat ner o installerat allt, men programmet hittar inte ljudfilerna. De kom ju som två stora ISO-filer. Ska man dela upp dem med nåt verktyg i småfiler? I så fall vilket verktyg? Hur gör man annars? Det funkar varken när jag kör det i Nuendo som vsti eller som stand alone. Snälla hjälp, jag vill så gärna att det ska funka."
,andolatut,2007-09-27T00:21Z,"This seems really great!!! But...
I´ve downloaded and installed everything, but the program doesn´t find the sound files. They came as two big ISO-files. Are you supposed to split them up into smalles files with some tool, and if that is the case, which tool? How do you do otherwise? It doesn´t work neither as a vsti in Nuendo nor as a stand alone. Please help, I really want this to work!!!"
,taiwanma,2008-03-13T05:43Z,Has anyone got the mac version?

,manoktrain,2008-12-05T23:38Z,"Hello funkiez, first off, thanks for the torrent. Great program.  Second let me apologize for my newbie status and idiocy.  I have the software running fine and like andolatut, can't get the sounds to load. I used alcohol 120 to mount the iso of the first dvd and got the updates running with no problem.  Was hoping you might be able to help as far as what I am missing here with getting the sounds to load. What I get with the iso mounted are files with extensions .stv .stw .stip .sth when the program is looking for extension .fxb for the banks.....  
I appreciate your help and the torrent. great download. "
,raxxroth,2008-12-26T00:18Z,"Thanks for the upload. Can't wait until I get this straight. Does it work properly though, like the real buyable version?"

but couldn't find any keygen for Mac, if you do, let us know! cheers "
,andrewblack128,2009-03-16T13:37Z,Don't know if this Torrent has changed since being seeded but there are nested RAR files and after the first extraction there is one RAR only and it clearly requires further files. THIS DOWNLOAD IS INCOMPLETE AND DOESN'T WORK.
,PaulHazard,2009-03-27T03:50Z,"Kissturtle, it has to do with the velocity. on your midi channel, select ""track parameter- velocity shift"", (not sure how it is in FL) and crank it up to about 40, then you will start hearing the slides.
hope this helps."

,Speziax,2009-11-27T00:13Z,"Ok, confusing as hell and completely inadequate explanation so far as the installation is concerned, but I think I've got it figured out. You get your torrent. It has four zipped folders. They each contain a sequential .rar (they are arranged in order and stay that way). You open one of the zipped files, and try to extract the rar, and you get an error message that basically tells you in order to do so, you need to 'have' the other one. The other one is always the next one in the list (B-MirPhi.part02, for instance, which would be located in the second folder). So you go to the next folder, and try to unrar that. Same thing, but now the dialogue is requesting the NEXT folder's rar, and so on and so forth - so here's what you do: 

Create a new folder on your desktop. Transfer, by simple click and drag, all 4 .rar files (one from each original zipped folder) into this newly created folder, and once this is accomplished, DOUBLE-CLICK the first one. You will notice there are more options now in the WinRar dialogue than there were before. ""Install Philharmonik"" will NOW WORK upon double click.  (Ignore Philharmonik 1.1 Sounds Updater for now) and after you've completed that process, activate the next relevant rar (Philharmonik 1.1 Sounds Updater.exe) and the process will move right along. 

Next: you will get to a point where it's asking you to enter your serial number; now that you have your new folder with the operational packets, return to their rar dialogue (double-clicking the first component will get you here) and run the key-gen. Simply select ""IK Multimedia Miroslav Philharmonik v1.x"" and click generate, and boom! There you go. Enter the serial number, and it will take you to another page which gives you the option to either ?Request a New Authorization Code? or ?Use and Existing Authorization Code for This Computer.? Select ""Request a new authorization code"" (per the instructions of the rar's info packet) and after that, ""Connect using another computer""  From here you should be able to enter your next set of information into the keygen, the 'digital i.d.' Of course once that is entered select 'generate' once again, and now you have your authorization code!!

Ok, so here?s the second half of the fun: after downloading the 1st DVD torrent of instrument content (located here: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3579866/Ik_Multimedia_Miroslav_Philarmonik_Sound_DVD_1 - you will need this for your Philharmonik application to stop telling you the soundbanks are empty!) open its corresponding rar. You should see an ISO image.  What I did was extract it to that same new folder I created on the desktop for those 4 packets earlier.  Once the extraction is complete, simply mount and it should execute the installation process for you!  You can select the destination of the soundbanks (I chose my external drive) or just leave in its default setting ? either way it probably takes about 10 minutes.  

Ok, final step: NOW execute ?Philharmonik 1.1 Sounds Updater.exe?, select the location of your bank, and proceed!

I?ve just finished installing my library and am about to run it through its first go-round..
and..

Success!  

Enjoy fellow pillagers.  Thanks for supplying the torrents funkiez and xxxbass!

And always remember to SEED SEED SEED!"

,djwallay,2012-01-12T19:52Z,"FOR FL-STUDIO USERS WITH INSTRUMENT NOT FOUND PROBLEM!!

I was messing around in FL Studio with this VST because everytime I went to an instrument it would say ""INSTRUMENT NOT FOUND"" and/or they wouldn't even show up under the ""Instruments"" side on the right. THERE IS A FIX :D

Just go load up the Philharmonik VST, and go into ""PREFS"" which is right above the word ""EFFECTS"" on the bottom right hand of the plugin. Click on ""PREFS"" and where it says ""RELIST ON STARTUP"" click the ""ON"" bubble. Now reload Philharmonic and the instruments should be there! :]"
