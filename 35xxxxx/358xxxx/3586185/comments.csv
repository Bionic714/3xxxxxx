,AKAliaz,2007-03-28T09:58Z,"John Even, this is in FLAC, not mp3, the files are bigger because it is much higher quality thatn mp3. Hope that helps."
,Camaro69z,2008-03-16T07:48Z,"Seed please. :)

I wish FLAC was more popular. I can't stand the compression in songs... 

LONG LIVE FLAC!! :D"
,FCCKiller,2008-03-25T17:46Z,"Yes, long live FLAC!

Could someone upload ""One X"" in FLAC?"
,GNR7600,2008-04-28T01:50Z,"If this is in FLAC, can itunes still play it or can it be transferred to a mp3 player? Just wondering so I don't waste my time downloading them.

or

whats a good FLAC music player?"
,MarcusHuddinge,2009-08-12T14:50Z,"Wma isn't lossless?
The highest bitrate i've seen on wma ever was 440kbit =x So yea... o.o
Otherwise you can just convert your Flac's into Wave files. Wave is lossless and can be played on like every single player that there is o.o Even portable ones =D"
,Metal1Dead,2010-03-31T07:56Z,"to the uploader , can u pls reseed ur torrent for papa roach -the paramour sessions . PLS and thanks"
,Dekrypted,2010-10-25T02:08Z,Just convert he Flac to Apple Lossless if you want the songs on your Ipod DBpoweramp is a really good program to use for that purpose.
