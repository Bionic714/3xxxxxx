No hard feelings against you apw. You are free to do your subtitles as you like (yellow, white or what color you like). 

It's just that I personally don't like other colors than white on subtitles. Maybe the mayority of people want other colors, don't know.

We can have a poll here too, if you want white or yellow subtitles.

Make your opinion please. (White or yellow subtitles)
