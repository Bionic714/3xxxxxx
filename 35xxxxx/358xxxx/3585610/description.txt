David Peel\\\'s classic album \\\"Have a Marijuana\\\" was recorded live on the streets of New York in 1968.  I ripped this myself from a mint condition LP that I purchased.  I also ran it through various filters to make it even better sounding.  This album includes the acclaimed song \\\"I like marijuana\\\"..  download and enjoy!
