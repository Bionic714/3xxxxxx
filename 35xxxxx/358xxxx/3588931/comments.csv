,WildWelshWarezWebWizard,2007-04-05T01:30Z,"Right...the problem I have with this is that he is comparing apples to oranges. For example he has a race between a Chrysler 300 SRT8 and a BMW M5. The M5 costs more than double of the Chrysler. There should be no surprise who will win that one. The tests are riddiculously unfair so they don't really make a good case against American cars.

It might be fun to watch ONCE but this DVD isn't a keeper."
,paulpowell100,2007-10-30T13:37Z,American cars are crap anyway
,raging80,2007-11-09T12:57Z,"The Crysler should be able to compete against the M5. The Z4M can keep up with the far more expensive Viper.

99 percent of American cars are rubbish. "
,daconic,2008-01-22T18:37Z,"The srt8 should not be able to compete with the M5.

The SRT8 is heavier, with less horsepower (and slightly more toqrue)... the M5 has it hands down. 

Especially when you factor the m5 costs TWICE as much as a SRT8.


You wanna compare Euro to American ? Watch top gear. THe CTS-V (400hp, RWD) beat a brand new Ausi RS4 (420hp, AWD) around their track without a hitch. 

But ya, ALL american cars suck. Im a fan of clarkson, but dont let him put words into your mouth.

,daconic,2008-01-22T18:39Z,"Also, if all cars are rubbish, why did he drool over, and eventually buy a Ford GT? Sure, he later returned it, because the immobilizer wouldnt work (or rather would work when its not suppose to) and they'd tell him his car was stolen while he was driving it, but he was vicious about telling people it was a TRUELY great car.

But no, American cars suck, thats why they turn a confessed Euro / Ferrari lover (Clarkson) into a 8 year old boy when he finds a fun one."
,Blackadder75,2008-07-28T00:02Z,"So why, you may be wondering, do I own a Ford GT? That's simple. The body is British, the gearbox is British, the steering rack is from an Aston, the chassis was set up by a couple of guys from Lotus, the wheels are German and the brakes are Italian. The power is American, yes, but it's tamed and sophisticated by Europeans. It's a metaphor, in other words, for the perfect world."
