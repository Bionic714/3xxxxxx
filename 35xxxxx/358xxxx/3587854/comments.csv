,Dodge34,2007-03-29T03:53Z,"This is the best program, shouldn't be put in teenagers hand, especially at school, it is a nightmare to cover the pc to make sure all of them have a bios password and can't boot from a cd or dvd, otherwise, boom, no more safety with Locksmith, they can get administrator powers on the local computer (thanks god most schools have an Active Directory system and the student's can't get full powers on the network itself)"
