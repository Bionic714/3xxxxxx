Was looking for a program to help us speed up re-conditioning second hand PCs in my work (and to bypass the XP passwords)

Found this to be a VERY VERY usefull application.



Just set the BIOS to Boot from CD, insert CD, hit restart and play away.

(Locksmith appears in the start menu items once system has booted up)
