Fruity Loops Studio for Windows

Fruity Loops is a full-featured looper/sequencer with tons of VST and DXi plug-ins, all compatible with CakeWalk, SONAR, etc.

This program allows me to create virtually ALL my backing tracks, from strings, winds, drums, etc... arrange in sequenced loops, and then simply add in Guitar Leads, vocals, etc.

VERY handy for Home Recording Studio and Project People!

Annoying Install Tune... but its fully cracked, and works like a charm.

It works best to Install FRUITY LOOPs, and THEN SONAR, or whatever you use to mix/edit.
