,opposite,2007-01-06T01:24Z,"Doh, can't you read or what? he don't know how to seed this upload. Its quite easy.. once you have got the torrent uploaded just leave it on as if it was a finished download, its no harder than that!, and remember to keep your ""bit-program"" running. You must have done it right once, else i wouldn't have made it to 92 precent!"
