3. Start-> Run-> cmd -> OK
4. Type: cd C:\Deflorator and press enter
5. then type: de-flight1.exe FS2Crew_737_Pro.exe [-r]
6. ""Press ok when wrapper has started"" -> press OK
7. do NOT!!! press ok when you see this: ""Press OK for immediate wrapper termination.""
8. Click Ok - > Yes, I Understand - > OK in the wrapper
9. Fill in some false data in the wrapper and press Click Here to Purchase. - > I Agree - > OK - > Yes
