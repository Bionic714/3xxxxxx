The program it's working perfectly.

Please, do you mind to let me now what kind of spyware is it.

Thanks"

,The Simpson,2006-12-31T16:21Z,"I also made a double check with AdAware and Zone  Alarm Anti Spyware and the KEYGEN file is OK!!

Are you sure is spyware?? 

Maybe is just a warning of your antivirus sofware???

So this western map i got it from this web,with torrent help.i dont knowif the map is ok because it asks me for an activationcode which i dont have it cose i downloaded the map.
i have tried all these keygen but wont work with them.i arrive to get the code but its says its no correct one.so, my question is how can be?
they say that keygen its working with one..is it a joke guys?or am i being tired?
this homer simpson is homeric?its not working the keygen.i really wonder about those guys who make keygen and all these stuff.really!cose i dont wanna pay a 200$ for a map, its too much,and i am poor(enough to buy a gps).
so if someone really can help me with an activation code that guy is smarter than me and i wil buy a beer for him.
thanks guys!cheers!"
,The Simpson,2007-01-08T08:38Z,"Hi emilluss

I'm sorry but I don't know what to say. The keygen it's working with my Tom Tom Go 510. I never wrote that's working even with ONE series.
As you did, I downloaded hundreds of different keygens before to find the right one is working with my Go 510. It's for free so don't blame on me if is not working. 
Bye "
