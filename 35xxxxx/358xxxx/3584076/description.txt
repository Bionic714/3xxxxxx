In 1995, FOX executive Brian Graden, commissioned Parker and Stone to create a
second short film to send to friends as a video Christmas card. Titled Jesus
vs. Santa, it more closely resembled the style of the later series, and
featured a martial arts duel between Jesus and Santa Claus
over the true meaning of Christmas.

This is _the_ South Park pilot.
