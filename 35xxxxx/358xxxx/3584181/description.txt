DISASTER! the movie. 

Animation (in clay) about how to rescue Earth from doom of a killer planetoid (asteroid). A parody of Armageddon and a lot of other movies. 

Lots of violence (in clay), gore (in clay), nude people (in clay), boobs (in clay) and sex (still in clay). 

I liked it a lot. Had a good laugh. 

And, no, it is NOT for children.
