,Rexxxifon,2007-01-05T23:01Z,a simple search to the guy that requested it would have yielded a result :) wonder why no one here uses the search?
,Sataris,2007-01-06T05:15Z,"I dont use the search alot either anymore

Whenever I used it, it was always broken

guess the TPB breaks easily?"
[T],stevekasian,2007-01-06T06:25Z,"Rexxxifon: I actually searched for it before ULing it again, but found that your other one was from March of 2006 and was no longer being seeded. And my hash was different, so I couldn't jump in on it with a seed."
,Rexxxifon,2007-01-06T19:46Z,"Fair enough Steve, actually I was referring to the one that requested it, while another was being seeded. It just makes it harder for people to get stuff when there's multiple torrents on the same thing, instead of 1 being seeded, there's 3 that are not, kinda thing."
[T],stevekasian,2007-01-07T17:34Z,"Yah, I know - just thought I'd throw out that little tid-bit o informaTION. I keep every .torrent file for every DL I make, so I can check 'em if someone requests sup'm L8r. Then I can cross reference them by number, etc., and have all the info right there, etc. Would be nice if everyone would do that, huh. >:-/"
