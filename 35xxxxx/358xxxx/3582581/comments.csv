,miketanner,2006-12-23T20:18Z,"I retract my previous statement thanks :)

P.S going to get some new artwork up soon on a seperate file as the last ones aren't 100% clear.

Cheers!"

,Diceman_,2008-02-14T17:08Z,"I unfortunately am a bit like that, I have a connection with only a 10kbps upload rate so it's almost not with bothering considering that it takes away upload data from my current downloads (at a measly 50kbps). 
I used to have an ADSL 2 connection with a 100kbps upload rate, I could get good ratios fairly quickly in comparison."
,JOSWHA16,2008-07-06T07:20Z,50kbps is a god send my friend! thats a fast average in NZ.
