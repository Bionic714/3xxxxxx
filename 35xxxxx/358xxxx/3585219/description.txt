TAKEN FROM Seed0 DUAL LAYER "PROTOTYPE" TORRENTS.\

This is a Divx rip of the second disc.

NINE INCH NAILS: CLOSURE
Original VHS release: 1997
DVD release: currently unscheduled

Unofficial DVD Prototype Release [halo 12 p]

Closure was originally released as a double VHS box set in 1997.  The first tape chronicled Nine Inch Nails' infamous mid-90's Self Destruct tour with backstage footage and raw live performances, while the second tape compiled NIN's music videos from 1989 to 1997.

In 2004, a long-anticipated DVD release was finally announced, only to be delayed indefinitely due to legal hang-ups and record company red tape.  Now, with no official release in sight, the prototype version of the 2004 DVD has surfaced.

This prototype has not been professionally authored, encoded, or color-corrected, and the main feature has not been digitally remastered.  As such, video quality is not as high as it will be if Closure ever sees an official commercial release.  In the meantime, it's better than nothing.

TWO VERSIONS of this release will be available, depending on how you intend to view it.  They are:

Dual-layer disc version (for computer playback or burning with a dual-layer DVD burner):
CLOSURE_DISC1_DL.img
CLOSURE_DISC2_DL.img

Single-layer disc version (for burning with a single-layer DVD burner):
CLOSURE_DISC1_SL.img
CLOSURE_DISC2_SL.img
CLOSURE_DISC3_SL.img

The content of both versions is the same, but the single-layer version is spread out over three discs due to space constraints.  The dual-layer version has slightly higher image quality.

Each disc is distributed as a .img disc image file (basically the same as an iso file).  They can be opened from your computer and played back like a physical DVD.  They can also be burned as DVDs with programs like Toast (Mac) or Nero (PC).
