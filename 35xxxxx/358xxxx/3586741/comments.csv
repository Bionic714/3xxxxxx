you have to activate it under the button action.
the timer counts down the days of the trial period."
,Manko33,2007-01-01T21:41Z,"I get none of that. Seems to be working ok. No nags, atleast. And autodefrag is being done. :)

Try to aply crack again, or see if you need to down one of the 2007 versions you see on this site..."
,Manko33,2007-01-01T21:44Z,"Also, the crack might not be smart enough to realise if you installed on nondefault path..."
,ALIEN68,2007-01-02T01:59Z,"This isn't a proper crack.After instalation and runing the crack its anyway days are counting down from 30.After instalation its anyway a 30 day trial version.What this ""crack"" does its simply after everytime you run it, it resets days back to 30.Maybe someone finaly will crack this program properly."
,tramho,2007-01-02T09:07Z,"I have version 11.0.686.0
I have run the crack several times.
and still counting down."
,domdom95,2007-01-05T13:48Z,"Hi,

My diskeeper has passed the 30 days and now can no longer work, just can do ANALYSE ;)

I tried this crack, what it does is to launch Diskeeper that keeps asking to activate.

So this crack does NOT work !!!!!!"
,Manko33,2007-01-05T19:19Z,"Actually they alter Tab.dll and reinsert License.dal and restart Diskeeper...
What this is suposed to do I can only speculate, but looking at the code it has to do with hashes and integrity checks...

If it works for some, LIKE ME, good, if not, too bad... A good crack will eventually come for youunfortunates too."
,The Punisher CRO,2007-01-11T13:30Z,Works. Thx.
,tzdaboss@hotmail.com,2007-01-15T11:07Z,doesnt work
,Fafik87,2007-02-05T19:34Z,It's Ok .Thx
,niovis,2007-04-11T22:57Z,"The crack DOES work.

If it doesn't work for you, it's probably because you installed diskeeper somewhere besides the default installation directory. What you can do is:

1)Run the Crack. The crack will create files in the default install Directory (C:\Program Files\Diskeeper Corporation\Diskeeper)

2)Crl+Alt+Del and end DkService.exe

3)Cut/Copy the files that the crack created.

4)Paste the files into the install directory wherever you installed it.

5)Enjoy!

Note: Diskeeper might not run without the DkService.exe. If so, restart your computer and you should be good to go."
