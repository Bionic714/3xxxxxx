Do your own research.

Fire does not melt steel at 1200 degrees F.

Steel melts at 2750 degrees F.

It's a technical impossibility for steel to melt at 1200. And it will certainly not melt in a dirty un-controlled open-air kerosine-fuelled fire.

You cannot get a 110-story pancake collapse in 8,4 seconds (free fall speed - the speed at which an object drops through air).

Never would a pancake collapse GAIN speed and go beyond the speed of gravity, it would LOOSE speed since it would fall into the path of most resistance - the building itself. For it to fall at free fall speed the floors beneath would have to cease to exist completely BEFORE the upper floor reaches them.

George Bush and the other goons in the government can't change the laws of physics, even if they say they can.

Learn to think for yourselves."
,All_Your_Sky,2007-01-02T18:55Z,"The simple facts of temperatures:

* 1535ºC (2795ºF) - melting point of iron

* ~1510ºC (2750ºF) - melting point of typical structural steel

* ~825ºC (1517ºF) - maximum temperature of hydrocarbon fires burning in the atmosphere without pressurization or pre-heating (premixed fuel and air - blue flame)

Diffuse flames burn far cooler.

Oxygen-starved diffuse flames are cooler yet.

The fires in the towers were diffuse -- well below 800ºC.

Their dark smoke showed they were oxygen-starved -- particularly in the South Tower."
,odnaix,2007-01-02T21:04Z,"Don't mind bobdaslob, it's a government employed terrorist who comments on absolutely all 9/11 related videos.. and a good reminder for everybody: Intelligence agency terrorist in all NATO countries are still, desperately, trying to cover-up 9/11.

It's a bit late since - according to the latest polls - 85% of the US population know it was an inside job, but that don't seem to stop them from pretending to be normal people on message boards, commenting on this forum, and so on...

Haven't realized 9/11 wasn't done by 19 arabs with box-cutters yet? Download this movie - and research 9/11! And beware that it's not just DoD who don't want you to know the truth, all NATO governments are still pretending there is a ""war on terror"".. download this video - and other 9/11 videos - and compare the evidence against the propaganda on state TV."
,bobsmith5,2007-01-03T04:17Z,"well, thank god the morons are now a minority as the people have begun to wake up. keep up the good work and continue seeding these great videos. the truth and the facts scare the morons to death that is why such vile language comes from their faces. filth is their only defence as ad hominem attacks. how typical of the braindead"
,bobsmith5,2007-01-03T04:19Z,"oh what a name bobsaslob is a perfect discription of his brain. awesomely perfect self-labeling, lol"
,polsy37,2007-01-06T05:06Z,"85% of Americans do not ""know"" that it was an inside job. That is a horrible stat. People who want to believe something can create stats or skew results of a poll to represent whatever they want pigeons to believe. What's funny is that many of you do believe them. 

You are, however, correct on the melting point of steel.  That is the temperature that it turns to liquid, hence the melting point. What you are deciding not to listen to, is that steel loses its tensile and structural strength at a point much lower than that, especially if it is supporting the weight of a building. Ask yourselves this, how did blacksmiths 1000 years ago forge steel? They did not have the ability to heat it to its melting point. Well, they didn't have to, as steel becomes maleable at a temperature much lower than its melting point. This is why it has always been a very popular substance to work with. 

I am a firefighter, and the basic structural integrity that I am going over is firefighting 101, support structures do not have to melt to fail.

Commanche, when did Bush say that he can change the laws of physics? I'd be very interested in reading that quote.

Ikobescak, how redundant is it to post a message on here telling someone that they have no life for reading and posting here, when that is exactly what you are doing? Not to mention hypocritical. All of us here have lives, other things that we do. Occasionally some of us are amazed at what some pigeons believe and feel like sharing our point of view. I, however, have never posted nor seeded, lies, innuendo, baseless accusations, skewed facts, and/or propaganda. Something you will never be able to say for the rest of your life. And I have made plans for the future, hanging out with greyriver and pointing and laughing at you guys. 

Thank you for the continued entertainment when I cannot sleep."
,polsy37,2007-01-08T04:20Z,"You really have difficulty catching the point of things don't you? I find you pigeons (get your own word, and opinion while you're at it) entertaining, but I find baseless accusations of mass murder offensive.

You don't believe me to be a firefighter, and I don't believe you to be intelligent and forming a cohesive thought, so I'll call it even.

What's the name and web address of the coalition that you are posting on behalf of anyways?"

any suggestions?"
