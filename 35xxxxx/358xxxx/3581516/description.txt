THE SAINTS

Roaring out of Brisbane, Australia, in 1977 with the punk-era classic \"(I\'m) Stranded,\" the Saints, despite going through numerous incarnations, were a part of rock & roll for more than 20 years, thanks mainly to their indefatigable leader (and founder) Chris Bailey. Although they didn\'t play anything that passes for punk rock after about 1978, and despite extended dormant periods, the Saints never officially broke up, and Bailey always seemed to have another version of the band and record ready to release. Saints fans fall into two distinct camps: the punk-era fans (up to about 1980) and the mature pop fans
