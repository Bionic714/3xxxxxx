Almost got to feel sorry for Sony...firmware 3.03 decrypted,  and their own PSOne emulator hacked to play ANY PSX game."
,Eddieh1979,2006-12-25T17:46Z,Hot Shots Golf 2 is NEEDED if you want to emulate your own psx games with 3.02-OE0-B. You need the base files so you can generate your own games. Hopefully we will see some custom releases on here like Castlevania-sotn
,Moomba,2006-12-25T21:02Z,"Does this torrent contain those keys.bin and EBOOT.PBP files mentioned in the readme for Popstation (included in 3.02 OE-B)? If not, where can I find them?"
,J-JONY,2006-12-31T22:31Z,"Yes, this torrent contain those files."
,XXrandomXX,2007-01-03T17:15Z,Rar files are apparently corrupted when you try to open them.  Even the .nfo?!
,XXrandomXX,2007-01-03T17:26Z,"Ignore that last comment by me, I was being a fool.  All fine now! :-)"
,tverra,2007-03-02T10:02Z,"virker dette med 3.03 OE-C?

Does this work on 3.03 OE-C?"
,Gunjyr77,2007-03-10T02:12Z,Not getting any connections to the seeders... Would someone be willing to post this on rapidshare or something please?
