But when i choose ""install"" at the gamemenu nothing happens..... After a few seconds i can press ""install"" again but nothing still happens. And so it goes on and on until i start making loud noices and throwing stuff around in violent anger :D

What to do?
I got a 3,2 Ghz with 1024 Ram 
Direct x 9.0c
Running Win XP

I want this to run, i had some sweet times with Darkstone a few years back!"

Sometimes the movies won't show - which just leaves a silent black screen, but this codec fixes that http://files.filefront.com/iv5setupexe/;1424264;/fileinfo.html 
 - I see nothing suspect in your spec, and even if you have ""the nvidia problem"" that just corrupts your display- It should at least install. "
,Cedaar,2007-01-01T23:23Z,"Ok, it works to install on my other low end PC
(1500 mhz, 512 ram)

But the exe wont work properly when i run the game.

Tried to dl some exes from Gamecopyworld and Gamefix but none of them works.

Oh well..... It aint my day today!"
,univibe69,2007-01-02T19:10Z,"Sad it doesn't work for you.  One crack used to work with W98, but not XP. 
If your burner won't write RAW data, 1:1 CD's aren't possible anyway. 
Safedisk protection is old though. You could try the generic wrapper tools http://www.gamecopyworld.com/safedisc.htm or the easiest solution is to run it from ISO with Daemon Tools etc.  
The old CloneyXXL+Clone 4.202 worked - dunno if it will work from that ISO, (though I don't see why not)  Handy tools to have anyway - I'll seed them  :-)"
,Cedaar,2007-01-07T16:50Z,"Mounted in Daemon tools.... now the install works..... and the .exe!

Funny how things turn out.
At first i mounted in Poweriso but i guess that the safedisc mode in Daemon is the way to go.

Thx Univibe69.. My girlfriends son will be delighted, Diablo and Titan Quest takes to much of his pc and the fact that Darkstone comes with swedish install means that i dont have to tell him what this and that means ;P"
