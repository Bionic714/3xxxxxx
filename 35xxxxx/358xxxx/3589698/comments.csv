,Tiffany1,2007-01-07T21:44Z,"Thanks a lot!!! The Danish & Norwegian languages works for the Swedish people as well, if they have problems with the English. :-) "
[V],VilleR2,2007-01-08T18:29Z,"Rather English than Norweigan och Danish... But you have to pay a little more attencion, of course.."

,johnleo,2007-04-03T09:35Z,"haha very funny dvd producer (not uploader) to make a dvd release with danish and norwegian + finnish
but not include swedish. where did buy this dvd?

very strange and kind of funny.

thanks again"
,ErnieMcCracken,2007-07-01T12:32Z,"?Only in Sweden? Only in mother-fucking Sweden? Stop bitchin' about the Swedish subtitles all the time!! This is pathetic! Deal with it bitches!

Also, try to be a little fucking grateful for a fucking change... Non-Swedish people do not understand this kind of shit. Your lack of courtesy and politeness is embarrassing for this entire fucking nation. This is sickening. Really.

So stop crying!!! Take appropriate action? Move on!! Take an English class if needed!

"
