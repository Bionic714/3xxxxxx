The Most Annoying People of 2006 is BBC Three?s first annual countdown cataloguing the most irritating celebrities of the year, from Lily Allen to Zinedine Zidane.

Does Sven Goran Eriksson make you groan? Is Madonna really our mum of the year? Are you bored of millionaire rock stars moaning about how depressed they are about their lives ? or are you fed up seeing photos of drunken reality stars falling out of nightclubs, flashing their unmentionables? If so, check out our celebrity Shame Academy of stars. These are the 75 celebrities who have set our teeth on edge, heaped ridicule upon themselves and kept our newspapers full of their gurning faces for the past twelve months.

An alternative review of 2006, the show also takes a swipe at the most annoying products, pop songs and pop culture disasters to have got up our noses in the last twelve months - including everything from the annum's most annoying fads to the most shocking celebrity fashion frock-ups.
