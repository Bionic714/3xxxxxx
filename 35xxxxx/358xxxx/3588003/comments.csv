When converting the Flac files to Mp3, it just runs through the procedure rapidly, it doesnt actualy convert anything, so in the end there is no sound to the files when played - What do I do wrong, anyone?"
,audiohead22,2009-07-26T09:32Z,"Why are you converting from FLAC to MP3 elpOp? There are many free download players that handle FLAC files and you don't loose any audio quality.

Thank you very much for the share Xoptics!

Peace,
