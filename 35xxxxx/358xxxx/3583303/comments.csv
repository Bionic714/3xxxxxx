,RENI,2007-01-12T21:00Z,"Thanks a lot for the upload of the Allied Disc.It's too hard to find the CLONE images of this game.(There are 3 CCD CLONE images of RA2&Yuri on the ed2k,but the images are bad and you can't even pass the protection check.)
Would you please upload the Alcohol CLONE (mds/mdf) of the Soviet Disc and Yuri as well?Thanks a lot. "
,WiNsUrFeR,2007-01-13T14:52Z,"First of all Thanks for the comment M8. 
Its good to know tat atleast someone appreciates the upload.
I will not b able to up the clone for the soviet disc as my original 
disk is too badly damaged n I am not able to get it to clone as it shud.
As for the Yuri expansion I have made a clone with nero as tat disc is 
easy to copy. I myself have checked it n it works without the NO CD 
patch as well.
For ur convinence I will up the same with the No cd patch, 
+ the official update.
Do lemme know if its okay with u or u cud like the Alcohol Image
Nero clone is of : 657 MB (689,797,216 bytes)(Original Size)
Alcohol Clone of : 786 MB (824,523,606 bytes)in file, 
changes to 657 MB when mounted
(Size increase coz of mdf/mds format)
So which one do u want ??? :)"

Cancel the autorun. 
Click ""Start > Programs > Westwood > Red Alert 2 > Red Alert 2""
U shud have no problem after tat :)"

,RENI,2007-01-17T00:28Z,"Just finished downloading the Allied Disc,but I got some problems when running it.I mounted the disc,installed the game,applied the 1.06 patch,everything is OK.But when I clicked the RA2 in the Start menu,the common Safedisc checking splash screen appeared and then stayed there forever,which means I can't get in the game.And in the event viewer the logs said ""The device, \Device\CdRom2, has a bad block."":o
Dunno why...any solutions?
Thanks again (again) for the upload.:p"
,RENI,2007-01-17T02:15Z,BTW:I'm using the Windows XP with SP2 installed.

,WiNsUrFeR,2007-01-17T14:52Z,"RENI ... I dont understand how tat is possible ... I 2 am using xp pro with SP2. I have mounted n 
played tis game so many times.... Well ! I am mounting the image on DT. In the options 
""secure mode"" and ""Automount"" is ""checked"". All ""emulations"" are ""OFF"". 
When I mount the disc it autoruns. I cancel it an instead start the game from Start menu.. 
Game works without a hitch. Get the splash screen, then the video starts... everytime.... 
Also I have DT (ver 4.06HE) n Alcohol 120% installed. Fst drive is Alcohol. 
2nd Daemon and last drive is my physical DVD writer. Plus I have done all of windows updates to date.
""Try changing drive letters"""
,WiNsUrFeR,2007-01-17T15:00Z,"One more thing .... If u still get stuck on the splash screen. Hit ctrl, alt del. End task in ""windows task manager"" and try again. I do hope it works. BTW did u d/load yuri's revenge. Did it install okay for u?"
,RENI,2007-01-17T17:29Z,"mmm...I'm using DT 4.08HE with Emulation/All options ON (tried the OFF option but no luck...:( ) and the first driver is the DT,second my DVD burner and third the CD burner.
The Ra2.exe and the (random name).tmp are the Safedisc protection checking processes,if the check is passed,it will load the game.exe to execute the game and terminate themself.The problem is the game.exe did appear in the Task Manager but the ra2.exe and .tmp are still there and if you terminate the ra2.exe process the game.exe will exit as well.
BTW:Did you checked the Event Viewer/System?
Thanks.:)
Oh forget to say that I'm still downloading Yuri.I guess the install will be OK but the splash screen problem will appear again.:("
,WiNsUrFeR,2007-01-17T19:32Z,"RENI - I installed n ran tis game on 5 different machines today. Wanted to find out why u were getting tis problem. 
Used DT V4.08HE tis time to install n mount image  to play. 
I did get the splash screen hanging up on 1.
All I did was hit ctrl alt del an under applications tab. 
Highlighted Red Alert 2 N hit end task. Got the error report crap. 
Again clicked Start > Programs > Westwood > Red Alert 2 > Red Alert 2... 
got splash up n screen went blank n the game video started... Dont seem to know why u r to getin tis problem. 
Even installed Yuri's revenge expansion and played a game to see if it crashes. 
It worked with no problems.
Try the ctrl alt del stuff a few times continously."
,RENI,2007-01-17T19:43Z,"Hooray!! You're right WiNsUrFeR.After ending the whole game instead of just single process.It worked.:DDD

Try changing the game exe. compatibility to run in win 95/98/2000 or the display setup. Remove any crack or game transformation pack if u have installed. Follow the instructions I have given N u shud not have a problem. Maybe its your PC.

,manangel,2007-11-30T10:39Z,"Thanks WiNsUrFeR! Great game, and very easy to understand your instructions. I have a few questions tho....

After following your step installation, I played a few levels before I downloaded and installed RA2 Yuri. Ocne completed, I played a couple of levels to to make sure Yuri was installed properly. Then I whiched back to RA2 to continue campaign and now, it seem to be having problems. Before I reinstall everything, I wanted to know if you or someone would have a fix for it. I remember reading about this in someone else's ""Comments"" but I do not recall if anyone had a fix for it or not. What happens is during game play, about 25-30 seconds after the game starts all my troops (sometimes) including myself  would simply explode for no reason. This happens regardless if you play vs the computer or doing the campaign. Have you ever heard of this before...? Please advice.

Other issue I?m having (which is not related) to this download, is not being able to seed for some reason. I?m currently using µTorrent and downloading either from piratebay or mininova. In the pass, my downloads would remain on my µTorrent list unless I delete it. Since it was not on my list, I don't think I'm seeding after each downloads. Now, my download is listed on my browser?s list of Transfers, and labeled as ""Done"" instead of ""Seeding""

I hope you understand what I'm trying to say. Sorry, I'm having difficulty explain this...."

The cdcrack is what the virus is.

Just delete that when you download it cause the rest of it works.

I know how you can play this very good game, but consider changing your operating system to Windows XP pro.

Here is how you do it.  Instead of just double clicking the .exe file, try opening a context menu by right clicking the .exe file and selecting ""Run as administrator"" (or something like that)  

The reason why you have to do this for it to work is very simple... VISTA IS GAY

you are an idiot need i say more, vista works fantastic unless you don't have SP1. Either you haven't used it for long enough to figure it out or you are a complete jackass.
