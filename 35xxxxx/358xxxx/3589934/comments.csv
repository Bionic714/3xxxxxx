I have never heard any of the 'Scholars for Truth' say planes didn't hit the buildings. If anyone is issuing disinformation, it is you!

So, Mr Stooge, who do you work for? Someone who would like to muddy the otherwise crystal clear waters (the evidence is astounding) and subtly point the finger at a certain racial group?
Get your head out of the chaff bag you stooge! The 'nebulous' groups you mention are extremely well documented. Does your 'Mob' still think we are gullible morons living in the ill-informed dark ages?
I'm not saying people shouldn't watch the video, there may be some elements of truth in it, but people not well aquainted with the matter should not be sheepish enough to swallow the 'blame the racial group' line too easily. There are mountains of documents, videos, and opinions, and any 'newbies' would be well advised to do a great deal of homework before forming their opinions. Should they fail to do this, and simply adopt someone else's opinion, then they could be considered part of the problem."

Reality necessarily appears ridiculous when one looks at it through a veil of false appearances one has mistaken for it.


>I have never heard any of the 'Scholars for Truth' say planes didn't hit the buildings.

From wikipedia:
""Two members of the group, Judy Wood and Morgan Reynolds, left the Scholars due to disagreement with the organization, objecting in particular to the Scholar's rejection of their 'no plane' theories (theories arguing that no planes hit the World Trade Center). However, st911 co-founder, co-chair and webmaster James Fetzer has recently spoken and written positively about Judy Wood's views - a piece by Fetzer on the st911 website argues that the Scholars should now broaden their research to consider the possibility that ""directed energy...space based"" weapons or ""mini-nukes"" were used to bring down the World Trade Center. Steven E. Jones and others have criticised the mini-nuke claims. Jones later resigned over the issue of the ""star wars beam weapons"" as a plausible theory.""

The announcement from Fetzer on the Scholars for 9/11 Truth website:
""I am inviting Judy Wood to organize a paneldiscussion on non-conventional means, including high-tech directedenergy weaponry, that might have been used to destroy the World TradeCenter. I am inviting Morgan Reynolds to organize a panel on planes/noplanes at the WTC.""


>If anyone is issuing disinformation, it is you! To correct another of your pieces of disinformation, The Scholars actually agree with Steven Jones! They have never tried to discredit him.

As I wrote, they lend credibility to the ideas by even raising the possibilities for discussion, and thereby discredit the ideas of Steven Jones by association.  This leaves them open to the perjorative label of ""conspiracy theory"" (which truly describes the aforementioned ""non-conventional means"").  They can then be safely dismissed and ignored.

""The most perfidious way of harming a cause consists of defending it deliberately with faulty arguments.""


>Someone who would like to muddy the otherwise crystal clear waters (the evidence is astounding) and subtly point the finger at a certain racial group?

Zionists, though they are Jewish, are not a racial group but a criminal network.  Most Jews do not belong to this group, know nothing about it, or vehemently oppose it.

It is no more anti-Semitic to oppose Zionists as it is anti-Italian to oppose the Mafia.


>The 'nebulous' groups you mention are extremely well documented.

Certainly, some of these groups, such as the ""Illuminati"", do indeed exist, but they trace back to Zionists.

Please get your facts straight when shooting out disinformation, it at least makes it more convincing.  

I have nothing personal against DBS or Huffsschmidt, just that when they attack people for being in the spotlight without actual evidence to back up there claims, it doesnt make you credible, as DBS has a huge section on AJ and it doesnt prove his claims in the least.

People attack AJ for using the term New World Order when he didnt coin it, it is the standard name for the group of people controlling our future.  So go attack Bush Sr. when he used it in 1991 ok?  Educate yourself, open your mind, seek truth, always choose your own truth.

That of course depends on how the word ""inside"" is interpreted.  ""Inside"" most directly implies a Bush and Cheney masterminded and orchestrated 9/11.  But in reality they are nothing but useful idiots.  Some Zionists operate from inside the Bush administration, so in that sense, it was an inside job.  But that would be a half-truth for Zionism is a vast international network, and was originated and carried out by many people outside the United States government."

They asserted this while still members so damage was done, and to compound that, as I quoted above from Fetzer's recent announcement, in case you missed it:-

""I am inviting Judy Wood to organize a paneldiscussion on non-conventional means, including high-tech directedenergy weaponry, that might have been used to destroy the World TradeCenter. I am inviting Morgan Reynolds to organize a panel on planes/noplanes at the WTC.""

I would encourage anyone who hasn't listened before to download one broadcast from the French Connection website before deciding whether to download this large archive of broadcasts or to dismiss it as nonsense or ""bizarre disinformation"".  There really is no gentle way to introduce this information to anyone.  Most of the interviews are of a very high quality, and I would recommend as an introduction one of those with Christopher Jon Bjerknes.

>It's complete and utter bizzare disinformation.

If this were disinformation, who would stand to benefit?

Who stands to benefit from all the theories that are pushed which never bring up the obvious Israeli/Zionist connection?

Both truth and falsehood can seem bizarre, and so the subjective sense of ordinariness/bizarreness cannot be relied upon as a criterion for judging truth.  (The fact that we are survival machines constructed by molecules called genes living on a rock-ball orbitting a spherical fire at 20 miles per second is shockingly bizarre - but true.)"

Pods?

Professor Peter Scott put it this way: ""Disinformation, in order to be effective, must be 90% accurate.""

Loose Change ignores the Israeli connection and place the blame on the Bush administration.  The producers of Loose Change stated on Air America: ""We don't want to point fingers at Israel for a number of different reasons.""

This is all appearance.

The offical story of 9/11 is likely to collapse soon, and when it does, those who orchestrated it will want to be in control of the truth movement.  And presently, they are maintaining control.


>I have nothing personal against DBS or Huffsschmidt, just that when they attack people for being in the spotlight without actual evidence to back up there claims, it doesnt make you credible, as DBS has a huge section on AJ and it doesnt prove his claims in the least.

When you have realised that Zionists are behind all this, it will become obvious that Alex Jones is acting as nothing more than a ""goy-pen"", given his avoidance of the obvious Zionist connection for so many years - until called on it by Daryl Smith, whereupon he went into ""damage control"" mode.


>Zionists, Elite, Illuminati, Jesuits, Vatican, Bankers, whatever! They are all bad, and as far as I am concerned, these and more make up the New World Order!!!

Zionists are at the top of this ""pyramid"", and the New World Order they aim to implement is a world government run out of Jerusalem.

The bankers are Zionists.  Allegiances have of course been formed between the elite and the Zionists.  The Jesuits and the Vatican have been infiltrated.

From the History of the House of Rothschild, by Andrew Hitchcock:

""1770: Mayer Amschel Rothschild draws up plans for the creation of the Illuminati and entrusts Ashkenazi Jew, Adam Weishaupt, a Crypto-Jew who was outwardly Roman Catholic, with its organization and development.  The Illuminati is to be based upon the teachings of the Talmud, which is in turn, the teachings of Rabbinical Jews.  It was to be called the Illuminati as this is a Luciferian term which means, keepers of the light."""
