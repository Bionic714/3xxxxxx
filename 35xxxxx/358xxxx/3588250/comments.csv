It's a bit late since - according to the latest polls - 85% of the US population know it was an inside job, but that don't seem to stop them from pretending to be normal people on message boards, commenting on this forum, and so on...

Haven't realized 9/11 wasn't done by 19 arabs with box-cutters yet? Download this movie - and research 9/11! And beware that it's not just DoD who don't want you to know the truth, all NATO governments are still pretending there is a ""war on terror"".. download this video - and other 9/11 videos - and compare the evidence against the propaganda on state TV such as NRK, SVT, etc."

Do your own research.

Fire does not melt steel at 1200 degrees F.

Steel melts at 2750 degrees F.

It's a technical impossibility for steel to melt at 1200. And it will certainly not melt in a dirty un-controlled open-air kerosine-fuelled fire.

You cannot get a 110-story pancake collapse in 8,4 seconds (free fall speed - the speed at which an object drops through air).

Never would a pancake collapse GAIN speed and go beyond the speed of gravity, it would LOOSE speed since it would fall into the path of most resistance - the building itself. For it to fall at free fall speed the floors beneath would have to cease to exist completely BEFORE the upper floor reaches them.

George Bush and the other goons in the government can't change the laws of physics, even if they say they can.

Learn to think for yourselves."
,All_Your_Sky,2007-01-02T18:55Z,"The simple facts of temperatures:

* 1535ºC (2795ºF) - melting point of iron

* ~1510ºC (2750ºF) - melting point of typical structural steel

* ~825ºC (1517ºF) - maximum temperature of hydrocarbon fires burning in the atmosphere without pressurization or pre-heating (premixed fuel and air - blue flame)

Diffuse flames burn far cooler.

Oxygen-starved diffuse flames are cooler yet.

The fires in the towers were diffuse -- well below 800ºC.

Their dark smoke showed they were oxygen-starved -- particularly in the South Tower."
,roobija123,2007-01-03T00:36Z,"but do the bolts that were used to hold the supports need to melt or just be heated enough to lose their threads ( about 2 mm thick at most) and thereby allow the collapse, and no i'm not in the CIA but i am a steel burner on demolition work"
,Scudmeister,2007-01-03T02:46Z,"NIST did FULL SCALE testing of the floor models with even hotter temps and the fires lasting longer.
They could not get any kind of collapse or weakening of the floor model.

Which proves that the fires did nothing to the building."
,bobsmith5,2007-01-03T04:37Z,"no rubija, there was not enough heat to strip the rivits which have no threads. this was an inside controlled demolition job, the evidence is overwhelming. you need only look at the facts and connect the dots, that is if you possess the necessary critical thinking skills "
,bobsmith5,2007-01-03T04:38Z,no steel frame building in the history of steel frame engineering has ever collapsed due to fire
,roobija123,2007-01-05T01:04Z,"Tall buildings have generally been made with a rigid steel skeleton, sheathed in the lightest materials to keep out the weather. Alternatively, reinforced concrete, where the compression-resisting and protecting concrete surrounds the tough, tension-resisting steel, integrated into a single body, has been used. Such structures have never failed (when properly built on good foundations), and stoutly resist demolition. When the lower supports of a steel skeleton are destroyed, the weight of the building seems to crush the lower parts and the upper parts descend slowly into the pile of debris. Monolithic reinforced-concrete buildings are diffcult to demolish in any fashion.

The World Trade Center towers used neither a steel skeleton nor reinforced concrete. They were designed as square tubes made of heavy, hollow welded sections, braced against buckling by the building floors. Massive foundations descended to bedrock, since the towers had to be safe against winds and other lateral forces tending to overturn them. All this was taken into consideration in the design and construction, which seems to have been first-rate. An attempt to damage the buildings by a bomb at the base had negligible effect. The strong base and foundation would repel any such assault with ease, as it indeed did. The impact of aircraft on the upper stories had only a local effect, and did not impair the integrity of the buildings, which remained solid. The fires caused weakening of the steel, and some of the floors suddenly received a load for which they were not designed.

What happened next was unexpected and catastrophic. The slumped floors pushed the steel modules outwards, separating them from the floor beams. The next floor then collapsed on the one below, pushing out the steel walls, and this continued, in the same way that a house of cards collapses. The debris of concrete facing and steel modules fell in shower while the main structure collapsed at almost the same rate. In 15 seconds or so, 110 stories were reduced to a pile 9 stories high, mainly of steel wall modules and whatever was around them. The south tower collapsed 47 minutes after impact, the north tower 1 hour 44 minutes after impact. The elapsed times show that the impacts were not the proximate cause of collapse; the strong building easily withstood them. When even one corner of a floor was weakened and fell, the collapse would soon propagate around the circumference, and the building would be lost.


 The connections of the floor trusses with the external wall were indeed not very substantial--two 5/8"" bolts each, so the floors and the wall could easily be separated"

The truth will eventually prevail.
bobdaslob! maybe your head is stuck too far up your ass to be able to realise that the truth about 9-11 is not what the media served us a picture of, or do you got a assfuck by the president himself--Die motherfucker!!!!!!!!!!
It´s sad that you idiot weren´t inside the south or north towers when they were blown by Controlled Demolition (the only company allowed at ground zero, not even FEMA was allowed acces)"
