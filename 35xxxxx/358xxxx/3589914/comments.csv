,galemann.,2007-01-05T00:49Z,"LOL R U INSANE DUDE?? If, and i say if, anyone ever gets this down they'll never seed it.. they'll close the connection and run as usual.., and in the end there'll prolly be some ppl screaming in here for seeders coz they're stuck etc etc etc.., hehe =)"
,Devinius977,2007-01-05T00:55Z,"omg..... I need a new hard disc...

,asort,2007-01-08T09:55Z,"Any subs on this?, and if so, what languages?"

I have uploaded 325% of of it now hope someone will have the hole one soon or maby most ppl only want some of them dont know"
,nismodude,2007-01-08T23:49Z,"i only need altlantis se2, but i will try to get as much upload as i can on this one...i have a monthly upload limit of 5 gig's and will be spending most of it on seeding this one..."
,hoku12345,2007-01-09T03:34Z,Thanks nismodude
,cliokoda,2007-01-09T18:08Z,"Great torrent, but wouldn't be more practical to pack only one season per torrent (with all extras for the season) and publish them separately. 

After that you could put together another torrent with one txt file in it, which will contain links to all uploaded torrents.

I think in this case more people will be willing to seed your torrents.

Just a comment..."
,willmer_,2007-01-10T00:19Z,"If U seed this so I´ll get it all down I promise to seed this for at least 3 months...And I don´t have the problem with maximum uppload...

I love this...

Big thanks to U hoku12345 "
,westgazer,2007-01-10T19:37Z,"This is going to take some time......please seed, seed, seed, seed.......

,hoku12345,2007-01-12T01:03Z,Whell good to hear there are ppl out there ho appreciate it. And yes it seems to be working
,nemesys,2007-01-12T10:40Z,can we get some seeds guys? ALL the seeds got their torrent and left....over 100 of us just sitting here waiting to finish
,dimebag,2007-01-16T15:32Z,"ja det är tur man har fet hdd :P fan va gött det ska bli när bluray blir lite billigare, så att man kan bränna ut sånna hära saker på dvd och spara platts på hdd:n "
,fannaf,2007-01-17T12:17Z,Fuck me how long would this take to download on a 2.2mb connection :( good work though :)
,hoku12345,2007-01-17T16:40Z,"fannaf whell as fare as i can calculate 4.74 days at full speed:
2.2 mb/s / 8 = 0.275 MB/s
110 GB * 1024 = 112640 MB
112640 MB / 0.275 MB/s = 409600 s
409600 s / (60*60*24) = 4.74 days
LOL that is a long time. I have made it to upload about 1 TB now. But not to many others seeding so if anyone would help with the seed it would be really nice. And thanks to the few that do."
,Rawk-Hawk,2007-01-23T19:34Z,lol the biggest piece of torrent i've ever seen ;D insane duuuuDe
,soultaken,2007-01-29T13:08Z,"all i see is leech leech leech!!!! 111 at time of postin this with 5 seeders, if any of us ever want to complete this then we need to sort out some sort of system where by some of us put priority to one series and others to another etc etc til we got them all covered, 

at least this way we are not relying on one rather small group of seeders to give EVERYBODY the files. hope this makes sense, i have set the priority for season 1 to high, 

please somebody set priority for season 2 to high and post here and 3 etc etc"
,soultaken,2007-01-29T13:11Z,"**after thought**

7 weeks to finish this set is a long time so seeds are really needed seed for ever more muhaha"
,soultaken,2007-01-29T13:14Z,"one last thing, when i get season 1 i am going to repack it and post the link here "
,hoku12345,2007-02-02T15:30Z,Yes would not be a bad idea if someone wants to repack them in each season. I think it is best if i yest keep on this one and keep the upload of this as fast as posible
,Mistress,2007-02-03T17:57Z,"Thanks, I'm just chasing SG1 S8 :)"

SG1_S09E11 does not exists, it is a renamed copy of E10
SG1_S09E12 has spanish subs
Atlantis HD S01E13 audio wont play in vlc
Atlantis S02E13 is in German, no subs"
,JustinSnow,2007-06-29T07:42Z,"Atlantis 02x13, 02x14

Both contain slow motion A/V
Audio is Russian or something."
,JustinSnow,2007-06-29T18:43Z,"Atlantis 02x13, 02x14

Can someone play these episodes and tell me if you get english audio or what....

Because currently when I play it in Winamp I get like 0.45x speed and a high pitch ring with really low tone stretched audio. Then if I run it in WMP then I get 1.2x speed and can ""understand"" that it isn't english audio that is playing. Divx is 2.4x speed."
,JustinSnow,2007-06-30T02:02Z,"I noticed that
Atlantis 02x13, 02x14

are both divx encoded and the others are xvid."
,SysGhost,2007-07-07T17:22Z,"Those who do seed this, please increase the upload bandwith. downloading this one with only 5 kbyte/sec is kinda... slow.

And those who don't seed at all: don't download it either. No share = no take
Gonna take years in this rate."
,Peto-,2007-07-19T16:19Z,Thanks m8!
,Bayz0r,2007-08-01T09:04Z,"I've been seeding this for about a month, my upload is 60KB/s, not much, I know, but still something.

This swarm is severely messed up, 8 seeds and 228 peers, more people have to seed. I need the drive space so I won't be able to keep seeding for ever."

,mike18xx,2008-02-11T11:26Z,"From the description: ""all episodes except....""

...?

What part of the *definition* of the word ""complet"" does the uploader not understand?"
,hoku123456,2008-02-15T08:59Z,"The time where this torrent was made only half of SG-1 had been aired, and the same with Atlantis only half of season 3. Then there have turned op af few episodes that have a problem with them."

,youngscientist,2008-04-24T09:14Z,"Please help!!! I was at 16% and suddenly i got an error message that a file was missing. I then noticed that all the Thumbs.db were missing, but there are supposed to be 4, for seasons 1, 2, 4, and 5. I tried to delete those selections, but it won't let me, and now for some reason my download menu thinks that I've downloaded 0% of the stargate torrent. Anyone have similar problem, or know how to help? My email is youngscientist600@yahoo.com. Maybe if someone can send me those 4 files, I could reinitialize the download. There only about 10kb each. Any help would be appreciated."
