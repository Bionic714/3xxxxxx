,thisisit3,2006-12-21T11:13Z,"Please seed, still stuck at 8%."
,Kyros3,2006-12-21T12:14Z,"Sorry guys but I am alone here! Connection is active all day, problems are temporary so be patient. And when you download this, please seed it  for as long as you can."
,thisisit3,2006-12-21T15:57Z,"No problem, i'll keep my azureus online 24/7. I just hope these videos are better than the vol 1, which look like VHS quality (noise at top/bottom borders, etc)."
,thisisit3,2006-12-21T15:59Z,"btw, it would be nice if you used Divx/Xvid codec instead of WMV, that will make them playable under all operating systems and will also play on home DVD decks."
