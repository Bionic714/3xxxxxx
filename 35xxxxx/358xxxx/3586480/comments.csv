,cfghyt,2006-12-30T17:50Z,really small file-size but could be useful
,tys1198,2006-12-30T17:51Z,Dam I'm using Bit Comet .80 to seed this thing but it's not showing here on the site that I'm seeding it :(
,tys1198,2006-12-30T18:04Z,"If you cant get this to download you can get the same thing from here:
http://keznews.com/1957_New_Vista_RTM_Timer_Stopper_Crack

I have installed this thing with the new Install and it worked out great but scan it! Just in case my virus scanner is wrong"
,tys1198,2006-12-30T22:28Z,No watermark (at least not on my screen) and this way of cracking it should make it so you can always get past wga for Vista updates due to the fact of the timer for the ten day grace period is stopped so it doesn't use the wga check. It will always see it as a new install and let you get updates. Whats even better is the fact you never need a serial number for this to work.
,tys1198,2006-12-30T22:31Z,Almost forgot to mention that you can choose which version to install too. I'm running Ultimate with no serial number :)
,rotemburo,2006-12-31T21:17Z,"Rearm with already installed version does not work for me.  Upon reboot, I immediately get ""Windows has expired"" with the usual screen to either activate or re-enter serial and no other functionality, obvioiusly because the date is now 2099 and the 30 days have thus long passed..."
,tys1198,2006-12-31T22:27Z,Yeah I haven't tried the already installed way yet but when I did the fresh install crack it worked out perfect (In fact I'm in Vista as I write this). My timer still says 43195mins after I put the crack on a week ago.
,tys1198,2007-01-01T01:40Z,"hmm not sure but if you go to the site where I got this from they explain in detail how and why this thing works:

http://keznews.com/

I wasn't sure how resetting the date forward wouldn't cause it to expire so I figured I'd just start off with a fresh install and follow these steps and it worked out nice. "
,tys1198,2007-01-01T08:33Z,Yeah it's supposed to be.
,ern88,2007-01-02T23:25Z,will it work with vista business x64?
,tys1198,2007-01-03T03:16Z,Not sure but worth a shot. The only thing I've tried it on is Vista 32bit. I was going to get the 64bit version of Vista and try the same thing.
,vh14a,2007-01-08T01:19Z,"Works on windows 64 bit vista ultimate.  
every time I reboot it goes back to the exact time I applied the crack!  Im sure you must have to make sure you reboot at least once every 30 daqys.   Nice!"
,XenomorpH_swe,2007-01-11T19:40Z,"When im pressing the TEST button it says. ""Cannot open  service manager""...
and when im pressing the INSTALL button it says. ""Failed to copy file to system 32""
but when im doing the time change in the Bios an putting it back in the OS the automatic activation time goes back to 3 days!!!"
,darrenj,2007-01-13T22:37Z,"same problem as 
XenomorpH_swe "
,gamepsyched,2007-01-23T20:22Z,i have wireless internet ... built in to my laptop ... i cant disconnect.... any way??
,gamepsyched,2007-01-24T02:17Z,UMMM ..... if u disconnect internet and boot vista .... wont it delete all files??? so how do i not connect internet to get this file back??
,gamepsyched,2007-01-24T06:31Z,"do you rite in ""\slmgr -dlv\""   with a space and dash - ??"
,gamepsyched,2007-01-24T07:12Z,what does the minutes should remain same mean??
,nontitle,2007-01-29T17:49Z,"well, for the already installed version, it says you have to set the time to 2099 in the bios and then to 2007 in vista... that doesn't make any sense. wouldn't it work better to set the time to 2099 in vista then change it to 2007 in the bios? i haven't personally tried this, but i would think this method would work better... and if vista locks you out, just set the time back to 2006 in the bios."
,Hoptu,2007-02-01T17:51Z,"For those of you getting ""Cannot open service manager"" error.

Right click the file, select run as administrator. That will fix it"
,ipwnnoobs,2007-02-10T21:30Z,i have tried using the timer crack when vista was already installed but it would give me an error message..(probably because the validation period already expired) but i will try cracking on a fresh copy...will see what will happen 
,ipwnnoobs,2007-02-10T22:17Z,"ok, now since the vista expired once, even with a fresh install, it still doesn't let me use it and only opens the buy website...........anyone know what i can do to fix this? new mobo or format C:\?? plz help"
