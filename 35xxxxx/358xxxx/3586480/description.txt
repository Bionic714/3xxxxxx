First off I take no credit for the crack, description, or files here. Just 
figured after all the cool shit I\'ve got from you guys I would try to give 
you guys something that I know actually works to crack Vista. Check the link 
contained in this folder to get to the site for a full description on how this thing works. This has been scanned with Anti-Vir, AVG, and Avast so no viruses to my knowledge. Don\'t ever download anything without scanning it before you run it! 

How to Install:


For a new Windows Vista installation:
1. Go to your BIOS, set the year to 2099.

2. Disconnect Internet (physically pull out your LAN cable if you will)

3. Install Vista. DO NOT enter any key while installing, and select the 
Ultimate edition.

4. Once vista boots up for the first time, set the year back to 2006 (from 
within Vista). Remember, internet should still be disconnected.

5. Reboot, and check date in BIOS to make sure its 2006.

6. Use enclosed patch

7. Unzip the patch and run the exe.

8. Click on test. It should say 4 timers stopped.
9. Click on the install button.

10. Reboot.

11. Connect Internet

12. Test by typing \"slmgr -dlv\" in the command prompt (in administrator 
mode), and note the minutes.

13. After about an hour of use, reboot and redo step 12. The minutes should 
remain same!

14. Enjoy!




If you already have Vista installed, you don\'t need to re-install it. You can 
just re-arm in 2099. Steps:

1. Go to your BIOS, set the year to 2099.

2. Disconnect Internet (physically pull out your LAN cable if you will)

3. Boot vista, open command prompt in administrator mode and type \"slmgr 
-rearm\". Wait for the command to complete, and then reboot.

4. Once vista boots up, set the year back to 2006 (from within Vista). 
Remember, internet should still be disconnected.

5. Reboot, and check date in BIOS to make sure its 2006.

6. Use enclosed patch

7. Unzip the patch and run the exe.

8. Click on test. It should say 4 timers stopped.

9. Click on the install button.

10. Reboot.

11. Connect Internet

12. Test by typing \"slmgr -dlv\" in the command prompt (in administrator 
mode), and note the minutes.

13. After about an few minutes of use, reboot and redo step 12. The minutes should 
remain same!

14. Enjoy!
