,Merdre,2007-01-02T11:21Z,"Oj, vad kan man s채ga, det var ju en ganska fyllig listsamling! Ser mycket trevligt ut (som vanligt)! Tack!"
,telepilot,2007-01-03T11:29Z,"Really great collection, as always! A high standard has been set for 2007, and I'm looking forward to more great music from my primary source of new stuff. These torrents combined with artist info from last.fm has kept me busy and happy all through 2006. My friends are happy too, as I'm introducing new Shankly music each month :) Great work, and happy new year!"
[T],Shanklys Love Child,2007-01-03T14:36Z,Great to hear you like the music as much as I do Telepilot. I'll try and keep things going in 2007 ;)
[T],Shanklys Love Child,2007-01-15T09:29Z,"Yup, ""Good Weather for Airstrikes"" is an excellent blog - well worth checking out!"
,carnydog,2007-01-18T05:01Z,"i love the mixtapes and collections
your taste is nearly impeccable (the gospel stuff confuses me)
thank you for all your uploads

one comment, though: if you were to release as sets of files as opposed to one big rar file, then we (the downloaders) could 
a) choose songs to skip ... i already own some of the albums represented
b) seed longer ... i do not have the drive space necessary to maintain the rar file necessary to seed AND have mp3 files which i can listen to
c) not have to read endless irrelevant comments such as ""how do i listen to this?"" and ""please don't use rars!""

i will continue to love your compilations whether or not they are zipped, but i feel this could increase accessibility and ease of use for many gormandizers 

thanks again for your dedication to spreading great music and thank you for reading my comment"
[T],Shanklys Love Child,2007-01-18T14:16Z,All good comments Carnydog - will see what I can do. 
,Iddiz,2007-06-23T22:12Z,Are these the songs who are in the mixtapes collection for 2006 (3GB)?
,swervedriver,2007-07-23T11:35Z,Mac users: MacPAR Deluxe can't manage this file but UnRarX does the trick. Thanks to Shankly for this awesome compilation!!
,stefanov1,2007-10-08T16:28Z,owner torrent...wish smiths didnt break up :(
,hap_morrisson,2007-10-10T23:43Z,"AMAZING
as usual, you make me sick
thanks
;)"
,bandwagon,2008-12-13T09:30Z,Awesome!!! Thanks you very much m8.
,diryde,2009-05-26T19:40Z,Boo on you for .rar'ing 400 mp3's! Most of us don't want the entire freaking list! And seeding would have gone MUCH better if it was multiple files rather than 1 2-Gig .rar file. I'm not even wasting my time!
