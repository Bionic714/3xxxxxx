,producer007,2009-04-17T16:24Z,dont normly wright comments but since downloadin stuf without virus scanin laptop ended up with serious virus so virus scans bein done with everythin you got few nice vsts up all virus free but this 1 came up with Trogan on mcafe dunno if its the keygen but had be deleated:(
,driver76,2009-05-03T02:35Z,"Damn Shame the TBK3 isnt included. Thats the secret tool. On harsh settings the thing rocks.  I actually bought the original sonalksis bundle a few years ago and would buy the TBK3 but am just totally skint at the mo.  Sonalksis is one of the few soft plugin companies I would support, Voxengo being another one, providing they stay away from Pace. It was due to my constant hassles with thousands of pounds worth of plugins I had bought, many of them protected by pace (Waves for example) that brought me on to the bay. I now use cracks of everything I own that had pace protection, and dont get the issues I had before..Amazing huh, my original copies fuck up my computer, but the cracks dont..Bleh!!

Anyway, this is a great bundle but if you do make a living from music the least you can do is buy something from the company at some point. Right then, theres my moral little tale, Im offski."

,jonni_sula,2010-01-07T07:18Z,it doesn채t work for me in windows 7 but on xp it did.
,mordokch,2012-03-23T21:35Z,"no probs extracting despite the stupid double packing, which is there no doubt to hide the trojan in the keygen. How fucking stupid do these arse holes think we are ? Fuckin cocksuckers."
,al_pigment,2012-04-12T05:19Z,"Has anyone gotten this to work on Windows 7?  I'm having a little trouble.  I'm getting a ""Next volume is required"" message. Any help would be appreciated."
