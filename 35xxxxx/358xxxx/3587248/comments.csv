,jeancdg,2007-01-11T13:35Z,"wonderboy22, thanks for your comment
since i have the concert, i try everything to share it, i made another Image file with a new menu dvd, sometime i make a new torrent file (because i'm not a pro with sharring torrents files, and no one try to help me, but like you just critics, oh Great you are !!! )
Maybe i will stop to try to share it, if the ppl are so ingrat with all the time i spend with that file"
,sheeba78,2007-01-12T20:56Z,"I,ve dl a torrent thats 3,62 gb or 3,82 as it say in the bittorrent, dont know why its differs.

I got a little dissapointed at both picture and sound, but the sound I could fix a little with vlc soundsettings.

Is this a better one?
Its bigger, but if its the same as I have now its not much use...
the one I got now has the MSN logo at the left corner of the screen half the time and sometimes it say controlroom..."

,sheeba78,2007-01-14T18:17Z,"se my message at the other torrent, and if u want me to seed this one I will...so let me know.
I have nothing against the menu, and I could fix the sound pretty good, but I m not sure of the image quality?

på svenska; det är inte så bra bild, men jag tror det kanske är för att det är så ljust på scen?
Jag har den förra koncerten på dvd och den har bättre bild...nån som vet?"
