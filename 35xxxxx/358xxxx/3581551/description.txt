 ↑                                                                     ↓
 ↑  We must all face the fact that our leaders are certifiably insane, ↓
 ↑  or worse - W. S. Burroughs                                         ↓
 ↑                                                                     ↓
 ↑  It is a 'no-brainer' for veterans within the research-community    ↓
 ↑  to understand that the US Government was deeply complicit in the   ↓
 ↑  September Eleventh tragedy. However, it has taken quite a bit of   ↓
 ↑  book-writing, in-depth journalism and documentary-making to get    ↓
 ↑  this rather simple message across to the masses of people in       ↓
 ↑  America and the world.                                             ↓
 ↑                                                                     ↓
 ↑  Those who have so labored are to be accoladed for their            ↓
 ↑  revisionism and bravery. However, veterans of alternative history  ↓
 ↑  know that such exposure is merely the tip of the ice-berg. They    ↓
 ↑  know that the masses of mankind need to dig a lot deeper to know   ↓
 ↑  the real extent of the treachery and guile of the world's          ↓
 ↑  so-called 'Democratic' politicians. The roots of today's           ↓
 ↑  atrocities lie in the ancient past, and in the agendas of          ↓
 ↑  powerful secret-societies who are moving ever nearer to their      ↓
 ↑  'end-game.' What lies ahead for mankind is not freedom, peace nor  ↓
 ↑  prosperity. Time is short, and if the human race is to end evil    ↓
 ↑  and survive it must first have the WHOLE TRUTH. "Solution-Think,"  ↓
 ↑  must replace "Problem-Think."                                      ↓
 ↑                                                                     ↓
 ↑  In Program Four of the 'Origins & Oracles' series, Michael         ↓
 ↑  Tsarion conducts his own investigation into the history of the     ↓
 ↑  very real 'New World Order,' detailing for us its founders and     ↓
 ↑  their real purpose. He reveals, in some depth, the magnitude of    ↓
 ↑  the occult agendas behind the furtherance of the draconian 'New    ↓
 ↑  Imperialism,' and lets us see just how those arch-enemies of       ↓
 ↑  America have slowly and vampiristically hypnotized an entire       ↓
 ↑  continent's historically-amnesiac inhabitants into selling off     ↓
 ↑  their sovereign power, prosperity and freedom. Using the           ↓
 ↑  September 11th attack as a back-drop, Michael's investigation      ↓
 ↑  into unseen and sinister stratagems involves warnings regarding    ↓
 ↑  the future. Michael insists that it is not by chance that we have  ↓
 ↑  conjured such evil in our midst. Overcoming our enemy involves     ↓
 ↑  re-learning better ways of being, not new ways to fight. As        ↓
 ↑  Michael warns, there can be no victory over an evil which          ↓
 ↑  strengthens itself due to our futile, anti-spiritual and self-     ↓
 ↑  defeating rivalry. As he reminds us: 'Evil does not take our       ↓
 ↑  power...we give it up ourselves.'                                  ↓
 ↑                                                                     ↓
 ↑  Michael opens the book of the world's secret history and focuses   ↓
 ↑  on the ancient European dynastic powers - the all-powerful 'Black  ↓
 ↑  Venetians' (Guelph, Saxe Coburg Gotha, House of Hanover            ↓
 ↑  Dynasties), whose agents operate throughout the US, in media,      ↓
 ↑  healthcare, big-business, law, and politics. He covers the         ↓
 ↑  English secret organizations, such as the Rhodes 'Round Table'     ↓
 ↑  groups, the 'Club of the Isles,' the 'Fabians' and the Tavistock   ↓
 ↑  Institute. He also deals with their lieutenant orgs in the US,     ↓
 ↑  namely the 'Illuminati,' the Scottish Rite Freemasons, the         ↓
 ↑  corrupt Council on Foreign Relations and the Trilateral            ↓
 ↑  Commission.                                                        ↓
 ↑                                                                     ↓
 ↑  Importantly, Michael's research indicates that these bastions,     ↓
 ↑  and their controllers, are motivated by more than simple           ↓
 ↑  physical domination of the earth. Although most under-informed     ↓
 ↑  researchers believe the machinations of political and religious    ↓
 ↑  elites to be motivated by simple greed and power-mania, Michael    ↓
 ↑  shows us that there are far more sinister reasons for the          ↓
 ↑  policies that lead our world toward the precipices of want and     ↓
 ↑  tragedy. We find out the real reasons why the vanguard of the      ↓
 ↑  West is back in the Middle East, and why our world has been        ↓
 ↑  engulfed in ages of crime and cruelty. Michael reminds us that     ↓
 ↑  the real "Intelligence Community" are those in America (and the    ↓
 ↑  world) who are not afraid to face the facts and intelligently and  ↓
 ↑  eloquently expose those who have no legal or moral right to        ↓
 ↑  dominate humanity. Although "We the People" are not respected,     ↓
 ↑  protected, served or free, there is something that can be done     ↓
 ↑  about it once we realize where the real power lies and how to use  ↓
 ↑  it.                                                                ↓
 ↑                                                                     ↓
 ↑  This one of a kind presentation will inform and inspire veterans   ↓
 ↑  and beginners alike, giving each viewer a comprehensive,           ↓
 ↑  no-nonsense, yet sane and balanced expose into the real history    ↓
 ↑  of the world. As Michael says: 'The subject of history as taught   ↓
 ↑  in schools is surely boring, but the study of how history has      ↓
 ↑  been manipulated...is one of the most interesting of all.'         ↓
 ↑                                                                     ↓
