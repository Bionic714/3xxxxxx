,Mr_O_Bond,2007-05-20T13:07Z,"When unpacked the files adds up to 5,9 GB, more than normal DVD capasity.  How shold these files be devided on to DVDs?  And it don't seem like any of these files are any aplication - so how do I use the files?  I cannot install it in any way.....?  At least my PC does not recognise this file-type or understand how to make use of these files.... "
,picaso457,2007-07-16T21:01Z,thanx gart for the file. It's working with me fine and there is no problem but i have a question i am looking for the trailer parts actually how can i add that to the epc ??? do i have to download the trailers file ???
,chienda,2007-09-08T15:53Z,"I'd already download successfully. Thanks GART so much!
It works fine. It's not difficult to install but you must use epc_kg13.exe down in http://www.hamsk.ru/murzik/Keygens/epc/
Original epc_kg13.exe have virus and not running.

This EPC version updated 01/2004, so it's not very old. Although it's not so good as EPC.net but it's free and very useful for who works in Auto area.
Sorry for my poor English."
