Once you've experienced the power of the present moment, what's next? Eckhart Tolle, who ignited a spiritual awakening in the West with his best-selling The Power of Now (New World Library, 1999), invites listeners to join him on a path that takes us even further into the profound experience of pure presence. Through the Open Door is Eckhart's highly anticipated return to audio, featuring new teachings on:

* Achieving, Space Consciousness, learning to focus on the underlying field from which all forms and thoughts arise

* Refining your alertness to become alive and present with every cell of your body

* The illusions that lead to suffering, spiritual longing, and the need for more time in our lives?and how to dispel them
* How to discover true liberation beyond the limits of the thinking mind and the ?little self,? and more
