This is one of my favorite Tolle presentations, enjoy and seed! I will seed daily.




From Amazon: The teachings of Tolle are deceptively simple. Here he continues his teaching on the benefits of focusing on the now and being present in the moment. He has a low-key manner that is easy to listen to and to follow. With self-conscious humility Tolle breaks down his ideas into simple concepts that together offer a glimpse into the profound. He takes his subject matter seriously but not himself, and sprinkles in a light dose of humor. The recording has some of the drawbacks of a live recording, from a baby crying to some volume unevenness, but the energy of the presentation offsets any such shortcomings.
