IRIN has produced a new film, "Somalia: A State of Need" (18 mins), which takes a balanced look at the country, the current humanitarian situation and the social impact of the Islamic Courts. The film includes rare footage of life in Mogadishu and the rural south. It is viewable online at: http://www.irinnews.org/film/. IRIN is looking at new techniques to distribute its films online in a higher-resolution format. As a trial of one technology option, we are offering a Bit Torrent of the film in MPG format. The file is about 450 MB.
