-What is \"Backup HDDVD\" for?

It can do backup copies of HD DVD movies that YOU OWN! I don\'t want anyone to do
piracy here! This software is a good way to protect your investment, because I have
notice that this type of media seems very fragile, if it\'s scratched a little or 
dirty, it won\'t play. It seems less tolerent than DVD format. (Higher density!)


-What \"Backup HDDVD\" is doing exactly?

This is a java based command line utility that decrypt video files (.evo) from a
HD DVD disk that you own, to your hard drive and you can play them back with a
HD DVD player software.


-What are the system requirements to use \"Backup HDDVD\"

1 - A Windows based system
2 - A HDDVD disk drive
3 - A HDDVD player software (like PowerDVD)
4 - A HDDVD movie(s)
5 - Java rutime 1.5
6 - The possibility to access the content of the disk with a drive letter under windows.
(you may need UDF 2.5 file system driver for this)
7 - A lot of free hard disk space to backup your movies!
