This project is a GNU GPL licensed, loose, from-scratch remake of Quake III Arena using only the source code from the source release. It's got four player characters (2 for both sexes) and some maps of extremely varying quality. It requires a Pentium 166MHz with 8mb video card, however like all OpenGL games, your mileage may vary.
