,Destoroyah,2010-01-07T18:56Z,"i got a question:
is there a difference between the 2 versions of the songs that are on both redeemer albums?
i know there are some tracks that are only on the underground edition and 1 track (ghost) is only on the retail version, but are the tracks that are on BOTH albums different from each other?"
