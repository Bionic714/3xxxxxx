,Somntuutan,2007-07-21T16:59Z,"So, how do you do so it will work on game cube? Do i need to burn it on a small CD?"
,spystyle,2007-08-14T19:10Z,"Q ""So, how do you do so it will work on game cube? Do i need to burn it on a small CD?""

A You need a modchip installed into your gamecube. 

Also need a special case that will allow full size DVD-R to fit. 

Then you may need to adjust your Gamecube's laser potentiometer. 

Then use only best quality disks, I use RitekG05 only for both Wii and Gamecube."

,shino123,2008-01-19T12:32Z,does this work in the wii cuz i got a message sayin (An error Has occurred) 
,ozke,2008-04-28T09:51Z,"Lolz, this dosent work without the real Action Replay memory card?! What a waste..."
,Rovelius,2009-08-02T20:11Z,"Of course it doesn't work with the AR memory card. The AR memory card came out with AR 1.20, this is 1.14B

Only way to have this working on a Wii is by using a modchip (hardmod) or going the softmod method and using Wiigator's Backup Launcher 0.2 (WILL NOT WORK WITH THETA NOR XI 0.1 !!!)

Action Replay on Wii has been disabled since 3.2 I believe, there's no way it will work without a cIOS."
