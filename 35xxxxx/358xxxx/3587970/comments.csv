,extrudedplasticdingus,2007-01-02T14:50Z,Could you open your connection a little more? This has been downloading for 10 hours and I'm only at 37 percent.  Thanks.
,millemis,2007-01-02T20:21Z,"Where are those 2 seeders???
Half a million leechers getting stuck at 38% !!!

He/she, who made the torrent should at least seed for a while."
,extrudedplasticdingus,2007-01-03T01:39Z,"Downloading 20 hours and 11 minutes...I've gotten 41.5 percent of it.  It's coming, but it's extremely slow.  It'll be worth the wait for an image, though, because Dark Side is worthless on separate files.  Interestingly, my client says there are 12 seeds but is only connected to one."
,extrudedplasticdingus,2007-01-03T19:01Z,"Well, I gave up on it.  There are a couple of torrents around which are better seeded, although I don't know know what kind of image file it is.  I wish someone would just upload a regular one."
,Gowsk,2007-01-05T16:52Z,I gave up too. Average download speed: 0.6 kb/s. There's faster torrents out there.
,Hotfoot,2007-01-19T17:43Z,C'mon. It was all running so well. Where is everyone now? Please seed.
