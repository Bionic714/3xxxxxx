,domdom95,2007-01-05T11:40Z,"Hi,

Thanks but who succeeded to make the 4.2 working? This is not a crack, this is the file you can download from the official site. In others words no need to upload it here, grab it on the official site. However the file request a key. The one I get from the 4.0.2 update do not work in 4.2.

So who today can play FS2004 with Radar contact 4.2?

Thanks a lot. :)"
