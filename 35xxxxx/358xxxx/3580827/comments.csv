,g92cat3,2006-12-21T13:15Z,the sound on this release cuts off 2minutes in to the film and does return picture quility is ok 
,tuppen2000,2006-12-21T17:20Z,En sådan storfilm förtjänar att ses på en betydligt bättre relle än denna...om man nu inte vill gå tillbaka till den sämsta VHS kvalitén såklart !
,Jacky_D,2006-12-21T20:12Z,cam?
,malcite,2006-12-22T03:06Z,This stops being a great movie once you read the book. Even if you don't everything would be messed up once the second movie came out (trilogy)

,Jacky_D,2007-01-04T16:31Z,"hade inga som alls problem att se denna, packade bara upp med winrar, och öppnade i vlc fungerade fint, även om kvaliteten inte var den bäst... men men, gratis e alltid gott!"
,Lars Andersen,2007-01-07T15:15Z,"To be honest the quality isn't the very best. Most of the screens are extremely dark, which makes them worth nothing. For instance most of the battle screnes are so crappy - need a nice version!"
,Motn,2007-01-23T23:16Z,"Not worth downloading this..

Quality is poor, u don't get half of the film.

I can think of a thousand things which could have made my evening better... Cleaning toilettes for example."
