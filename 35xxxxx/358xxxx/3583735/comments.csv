Seriously though ear training is one of the most important parts of knowing your instrument.

How would you get out tunes you have in your head ? By trial & error ?

I don't know about this program though, could anyone tell me what it does exactly ? Play random notes which you then have to guess ?"

  This is a simple program that will help you learn to recognize intervals, chord progressions, etc....by ear. "
