Jimmy Reed was born in Leland, Mississippi in 1925, learning the 

harmonica and guitar from Eddie Taylor, a close friend. After spending 

several years busking and performing in the area, Reed moved to 

Chicago, Illinois in 1943 before being drafted into the United States 

Navy during World War II. In 1945, Reed was discharged and moved back 

to Mississippi for a brief period, marrying his girlfriend, Mary "Mama" 

Reed, before moving to Gary, Indiana to work at an Armour & Co. meat 

packing plant.

Reed's crossover appeal peaked during the revival of interest in the 

blues during the early Sixties, a period that found him playing such 

hallowed venues as Carnegie Hall and the Apollo Theater. He also toured 

England, where he was revered by musicians such as the Rolling Stones, 

who covered "Honest I Do," and Van Morrison, who recorded "Bright 

Lights, Big City" while with the group Them. Back in America, Reed's 

influence extended to such groups as the Grateful Dead, who performed 

his songs in their jugband days and recorded "Big Boss Man" on a 1971 

live album.

Jimmy Reed died in 1976, a few days short of his 51st birthday. He is 

interred in the Lincoln Cemetery in Worth, Illinois.

In 1991 Jimmy Reed was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.
