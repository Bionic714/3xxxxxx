,mkmg365,2008-03-11T15:30Z,"I hope I'm doing this right.  I'm downloading SMDM--and it says something about uploads--% points.  When I'm done--I will leave this up so it can continue this upload thing.  I think that's the seeding part but am unsure (hey I'm new to bittorrent and the terms are confusing to me).

I hope to God its in English...or I'm screwed.  Thanks for having this huge torrent (is that the right word for ""file"" in torrent language?).
