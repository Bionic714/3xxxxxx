The Pacific Ocean breeds the biggest and most powerful typhoons in the world. So far, the seven million inhabitants of Hong Kong have never felt the full impact of a typhoon, but a change in weather means that the most powerful force of nature has the island in its sights. Dr Chai of the Hong Kong Observatory has a few short hours to determine whether the super typhoon will hit or miss. Out on the streets, fire service officer Annie Soho is taking no chances, worrying that her father - a fisherman - may be lost to the storm. With conditions already ripe for the most destructive typhoon imaginable, watch as detailed CGI illustrates how the storm would come together and arrive at Hong Kong?s door. Experts explain how the city?s skyscrapers would react to a super-strength typhoon and how the city would deal with the crisis.
