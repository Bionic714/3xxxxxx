,supermurer,2006-12-27T07:32Z,Part 2 ?
,boppan,2006-12-27T10:39Z,"Wonderful
He is the king"
,majtymicke,2006-12-27T18:57Z,"Can anyone find a link to any of these records? I want to find out if its several takes of the same songs 5-8 times on the same record. I get bored when its like that Im afraid =/ Good upload nevertheless.
Miguel has it all in his magic toybox =D"
,affekopp,2006-12-27T20:50Z,You mean you get bored  from listening to the king working on the arrangements of his  famous songs? Oh my god. Then this torrent is not for you. By the way. If you got all the sessions you can arrange great CD compilations of your own.
,holken1,2006-12-27T21:11Z,this totally rocks. big thanks.
,CinEmaS,2006-12-28T00:03Z,"Cool, Thanks!
But why ripp without complete filenames?
ItÂ´s so sad to only see Track 1,Track 2 ......."
,Miguel28,2006-12-28T12:59Z,"i know, but i got this collection on mp3 and it was already like that"
,scottdk,2006-12-28T15:10Z,"Do they sell this or is this just a compilation put together by someone? 

I know this doesnt apply to this torrent since Miquel said he got this in mp3 but for all you guys out there that have alot of stuff, it really makes a difference if it would be in lossless FLAC.  I'm sure most of you dont want to here that and think I'm just a crazy nut but trust me you will be kicking yourselves a year from now.  I started collecting grateful dead about 20 years ago and in 1999 we finally figured out that lossless was the only way to go, SHN then we moved on to FLAC.  For those of you that have all of the originals, FTD's, etc, you should be ripping everything with EAC to FLAC just for backup reasons.  What would you do if your dog was chewing on your Elvis is Back DCC Gold disc? Plus when you have everything archived, you no longer need to ripp anything and can just skip the EAC step altogether which saves a ton of time.  Just decode and burn.  Even with EAC(which is the only one that works) you wouldnt want to rip a copy and then someone else rip that copy because there is no way it would be an exact copy.  

Merry Christmas everyone,

This torrent looks like a doozy, thanks for all that you do.  Bring on the FTD FLACs . . ."

,Miguel28,2006-12-28T15:29Z,"I see what you mean, of course in lossless format is always better, because we'll be getting the same sound quality that it's on CD. But most of my collection is on mp3, i got it for somewhere else... although i can rip the originals i have in lossless, no problem
Regarding this set, it's a BMG product, not a compilation by someone else"
,Miguel28,2006-12-28T15:31Z,At least according with the logo on the cover
,scottdk,2006-12-28T15:37Z,Wow thats one huge BMG release . . .sure any originals you have that can go to FLAC would be fantastic
,lapouleus,2006-12-29T05:03Z,"It's definitely not a bmg release
1956 volume 5 is taken from a vinyl source
and a bad one too
thx"
,Miguel28,2006-12-29T12:06Z,"Yeah, and i nottest that too on some other volumes coming up, they're from vinyl"
,lapouleus,2006-12-29T20:47Z,"Yes Migue28
but a nice compilation anyway!!!
with all artworks 
Part 2 soon????"
,sutteb,2007-03-11T01:31Z,"thanks miguel,you are great."
,galland,2007-04-16T12:39Z,hey your fuck 60% of the files are not working !!!!
