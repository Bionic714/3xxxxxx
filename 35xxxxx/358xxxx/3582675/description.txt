Ok here it is, the double length double sized(!) Christmas and New years special show.
This is already being seeded but I went ahead with this as the quality is far superior to the one going around...sorry but it's true!
so grab this if you value sound quality..
Tracklist?
well let's just say it's a christmas special so use your imagination!
(Hint - it does not have that 'I wish it could be christmas every day' crap on it at least!)

Happy holidays and don't be impatient...I #AM seeding but there's a limit to my upload speed so it will come, maybe just be a little slow to start with.
