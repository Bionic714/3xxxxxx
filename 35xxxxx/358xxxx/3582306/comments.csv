With all the advances in animatronics and CGI this story would make a great remodel/remake...again. It would have to be directed by Guillermo del Toro or Tomas Alfredson...someone who can get dark without going down the Disney is-anybody-there-jump-out-of-your-seat crap...Of course, if anyone with the funding is reading I'm available  in all capacities: directing, screen writing, key grip, running, coffe making etc.   "
