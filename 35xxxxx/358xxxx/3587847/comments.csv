,hh674523,2007-01-02T04:38Z,Why is religion so offensive to so many people? I find all the hateful comments on this site quite amazing... doesn't people have anything better to do than to hate people and/or their religion?

Isn't religion the seed of hate and intolearance amongst people? 
Take a look at the world today if you want examples."
,hh674523,2007-01-02T19:56Z,"No, it isn't. People are the ones doing the hating. All profets I know of, including Moses, Jesus and Muhammad, preach love and tolerance. Anyone claiming anything else is just misinformed."
