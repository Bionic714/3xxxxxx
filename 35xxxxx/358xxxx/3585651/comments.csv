I don't recommend Dling this It's a great program but my internet was shut off because of it. I live in SoCal and my ISP is Cox. I don't know how TTC found out or how they got Cox to shut off my internet but they did and it sucks. Just be aware that this may happen. Good Luck!"

You and anyone else considering dl-ing ttc material should be aware that *it is among the most heavily defended material by anti-p2p concerns because ttc have arranged it that way.*  If you want to dl them then you should exercise the kind of caution that, in truth, you should definitely be exercising anyway even if you weren't p2p-ing.

At the *very least* use PeerGuardian2 from Methlabs - but even at that you are still taking a chance - and *always enforce encryption* in your p2p client.

Better still, enforce encryption, use PeerGuardian2 *and subscibe to a VPN connection*.  VPN connections can now be got at inexpensive prices.  Once you have one, and use it to p2p with, your actual isp address is never shown in any swarm.  The ip address that is shown is the one that the VPN provider has provided you with.  If you've chosen to subscribe to a VPN in Tibet then as far as any tracker and anyone in any swarm is concerned, including anti-p2p participants, you and your isp are in Tibet.

Another advantage to using a VPN is that now your own isp can't tell that are you are doing p2p either.  (They might guess it from the manner in which the data stream is conducting itself, but they cannot actually prove it.)  So long as you are using the VPN connection all your isp can see is that you are connected to a VPN, and nothing else (provided your isp doesn't actually fully monitor your connection *and break the encryped stream* between your computer and the VPN - doing that is not a trivial matter and at this point in time no isp, on cost grounds alone, would even consider attempting to do it for thousands upon thousands of VPN connections.  Even if they could do it easily (they can't) they would still have to hold back because of legal issues involved in an isp deciding it was okay to go ahead and bust encrypted VPN connections - they'd be in court faster than you could say ""Boo"" and at the very least leave with their asses in a sling.

In addition the same kind of thing applies to web browsing using the VPN (provided you choose the right kind of VPN) - your isp can't even know where you are browsing.  So you can visit tpb (or anywhere else for that matter) and your isp won't know you've done that and won't know that you've dl-ed a new torrent file for you p2p-client.
