This album is great and is highly recommended to anyone who likes some semi-electronic indie-rock. (Radiohead --- Kid A, Amnesiac, Hail to the Thief --- comes to mind at times, but without VETO sounding like ripoffs or anything like that.) Enjoy!"
,lillesvin,2007-01-02T23:56Z,"Hmm, I've been trying to download this since a couple of minutes after you posted it and not a single byte has been transfered in my direction... I'm beginning to suspect there's something wrong somewhere...
Right now the official BitTorrent client (for Linux) says that I'm ""connected to 5 peers with an average of 19.8% completed (total speed 0 kB/s); connected to 0 seeds; also seeing 0.991 distributed copies""...
Doesn't it seem kinda odd, that it doesn't download anything? Other torrents work just fine."
,ButtGoat,2007-01-03T03:52Z,"I am still trying to seed this torrent. Seemed there was some trouble with Bitlord, so I switched to BitTornado, I hope it works now. I will still be seeding as much as I possibly can. Sorry for the inconvenience. "
,Saibot1008,2007-01-31T14:09Z,Plz seed! :)
,Lhadrepsak,2007-03-03T21:50Z,"Come on seeders!

Once I'll get this, I promise there'll be no trouble with the DL speed anymore ;D I'll be seeding with about 1.5 mbps ;)"
,Pudels,2007-07-12T23:14Z,someone give some seeds to epo-555 PLZ! Love danish music!
,pAbzT,2007-11-23T19:42Z,"There is no problems with the seeding anymore, "
,applearch,2008-09-29T19:10Z,FLAC or 320 kbps at least....
