You say it's a non-denominational approach, meaning somehow this makes it better? Well, I have a question for you: a non-denominational approach implies that it's mainly a ""private"" interpretation. God's endtime church is going to be a worldwide movement, so he has a lot of work to do to get the Gospel to every single country and not only preach the Word, but to minister to the sick, poor, imprisoned, etc. In fact, Revelation says God's endtime Church will keep the commandments of God and have the testimony of Jesus (Rev. 12:17; 14:12). How many churches keep ALL !) of God's commandments (including the true Sabbath, Saturday - from Friday sundown to Saturday sundown? I am willing to bet he keeps Sunday, the pagan day of worship instituted by the Catholic Church in the third century. Check it out for yourself."
