This is the introductory CD offered by The Shepherd\\\'s Chapel in Gravette Arkansas. Pastor Arnold Murray is the best chapter by chapter, verse by verse Bible teacher and scholar I have ever been able to find. He never begs for money yet maintains a world wide ministry and has his own 24 hour satellite uplink so that his lessons can viewed around the world. His Bible studies can also be heard and viewed via the Internet at www.sheperdschapel.com. This CD is one of many subject lessons he has also done and a good sampling of his teaching style. If you have had your fill of milk and are ready to get into the meat of our Father\\\'s Word, and want an in depth understanding of the Word, then this is what you have been waiting for.
Dr Murray is an ex Marine with a no nonsense, non-denominational approach to guiding you through the Bible. He pulls no punches and tells it like it is no matter who it may offend. You could go to a religious college for years and never get a fraction of the Bible insight you will gain from Shepherd\\\'s Chapel. I highly recommend it!
