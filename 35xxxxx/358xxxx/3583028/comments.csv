,jordinary,2008-12-13T21:54Z,"I'm having the same problem, it's not actually an ISO file. How do I burn this torrent once it's completed?"
,jordinary,2008-12-13T22:14Z,JUST MADE A COASTER! IS ANYONE GONNA HELP AT ALL?
,sophiroth,2010-02-01T10:31Z,"OK everyone stop whinging. The ISO itself does burn and start up on my PS2. BUT - It comes up with the usual ""there's no data, do you want to create?"" ""yes"" ... then it just comes up with this error message that flashes up so fast you can't read it. 

So yeah this game doesn't work."

Thank you uploader ^.^ I wanted to try the JPN versions of DDR ever since I started playing. "
