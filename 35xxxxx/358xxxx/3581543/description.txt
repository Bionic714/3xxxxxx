 ↑  - What did Jesus mean when he said the Temple of God is within,    ↓
 ↑    and that others could do what he did?                            ↓
 ↑  - Why did Jesus refer to himself as the "Morning Star," and ask    ↓

 ↑  In Program Five, of the "Origins & Oracles" series, we learn       ↓
 ↑  about the real origins and meaning of the term - "Holy Spirit,"    ↓
 ↑  and we learn what humanity must do to secure its survival in the   ↓
 ↑  following years. We discover the actual roots of Christianity and  ↓
 ↑  find out what religious hierarchs have been hiding for over 2,000  ↓
 ↑  years. Michael Tsarion investigates the suppression of women, the  ↓
 ↑  ecocidal tendency and the corruption in high places. Since, as     ↓
 ↑  Michael Tsarion says, the world elites have allegiances to hidden  ↓
 ↑  cults and secret societies, how can we expect them to honor their  ↓
 ↑  professed duties to humanity? In this all-revealing presentation   ↓
 ↑  we discover that the modern religions and political ideologies     ↓
 ↑  morphed out of seven great cults of power which ruled the world    ↓
 ↑  for millennia. The most powerful of these Cults was the "Stellar   ↓
 ↑  Cult," dominant for over 10,000 years. Christ and the other Magi   ↓
 ↑  were initiates of this Cult, which gave mankind such sciences as   ↓
 ↑  astrology, astromancy, and the Tarot. Known as "Serpents," they    ↓
 ↑  were the architects of the great temple structures such as the     ↓
 ↑  pyramids and the Sphinx. After the great Cults became corrupted    ↓
 ↑  they eventually gave rise to the modern exploitative religious     ↓
 ↑  and political hierarchies that prey off society today. We are      ↓
 ↑  still controlled by the elite bloodlines of these secret orders    ↓
 ↑  which continue to lead the world toward ruin and chaos. In this    ↓
 ↑  astounding presentation, Michael Tsarion demonstrates how          ↓
 ↑  religion and politics work to shape both the events around you,    ↓
 ↑  and the thoughts within you. "Astro-Theology" reveals the nature   ↓
 ↑  of the psychic and spiritual desecration which covertly operates   ↓
 ↑  upon us daily, and unlike the majority of other experts and        ↓
 ↑  researchers, Michael offers provocative solutions to our social    ↓
 ↑  and psychic predicaments.                                          ↓
