,Send-Receive,2006-12-27T22:16Z,"That guy is extremely postulating, although he touches interesting areas, he doesn't make the slightest effort to explain his reasoning. Therefore this programme makes no sense to me at all - just waste of my time. Hope you are in to this already, and can do the reasoning for him! Bon Appetite!"
,bthoer,2006-12-28T08:14Z,@sendreceive: that you think it is a waste of time tells us more about you than about this extremely interesting series ;)

How wonderful of you to label him, that way you help to illustrate the stupidification of the world today. 

I prefer to read/watch and then make up my own mind, I hate people labeling other people. It's simply stupid to avoid reading based on someone elses opinion, free your minds from mental slavery people!!!"

alright, he shouldn't called it stupid etc, but the main trick is just to ignore negative expressions and come over it with something positive!"

,piratebay75,2011-04-10T11:47Z,"Every time this guy says ""And this is where you have to understand..."" or ""Now you realize..."" I talk back to the screen, telling him ""No, YOU have to realize you're a nutcase!""

Deep paranoia and a profound sense of superstition abound. Not even good for a survey on astrology, mythology and old religions: I mean he cites madam Blavatsky as an actual authority. Viewer discretion advised."
