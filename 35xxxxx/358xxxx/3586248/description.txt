A welcome dose of old-fashioned animation for parents and a delightful, easy-to-follow experience for kids, this is a nostalgic cartoon feature for fans of the Pooh series. Rabbit, Piglet, Tigger, Eyore, Winnie the Pooh, Kanga, and Roo, are all on hand for a lesson in how to fearlessly face new and possibly strange experiences. The plot concerns the hysterical panic that arises when the gang learns of a nearby family of dreaded heffalumps. Their subsequent excursion into Heffalump Hollow to capture the beasts is not a great success, but the littlest member of each side--Lumpy (Kyle Stanger) and Roo (Nikita Hopkins)--end up meeting and becoming friends. Mutual distrust lingers amongst the other animals however, and when Pooh and company try to capture Lumpy, his well-meaning but overprotective mom (Brenda Blethyn) charges to the rescue. The always relevant "don't judge a book by its cover" moral is conveyed with subtlety and wit, the animation style is clean and calming, and the scenery is rendered with an easy-on-the-eye pastel palette. There's an assortment of fun and lovely songs as well, including: "The Horrible, Hazardous Heffalumps," "Shoulder to Shoulder," and "Little Mister Roo" by Carly Simon. Parents may heave a nice sigh of relief to see that an animated film doesn't have to be rife with hyperkinetic action and over-the-top clowning to excite their kids' imagination.
