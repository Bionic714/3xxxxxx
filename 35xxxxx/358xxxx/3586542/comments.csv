,neslesman,2006-12-31T01:07Z,According to the jeppessen web site this also has the interface.  I am so excited.  does anyone know what regions are included?
,rikzter7674,2006-12-31T01:44Z,Neslesman: It has all major airports from 6 continents. I know because I have an older version of JeppView.

Is it possible to burn it and to run it from the cd?

Or do we have to mount it?"
,vidor16,2006-12-31T14:20Z,"If you want to burn the disk.

Use Nero Burning ROM -> Devices -> Burn Image option
Select the Image file, and click Burn."
,caruso2006,2006-12-31T14:59Z,Thanks for such a quick reply...
,neslesman,2006-12-31T20:41Z,Burned and worked just dandy as per vidor's post.  This has been a great Xmas present captain.

,albertoan,2007-02-03T14:22Z,"Dear Sir:  

I am very happy to found a file of this date type , thank you, it is truly an excellent tool for these that we 
are passionate for the aviation. I download the file JeppView 0623 and I need their help to be able to 
use it. The download file ist in format WinRAR not in ISO. I have had the following problems:  

1. - I have decompressed it inside a portfolio in the desktop, to the portfolio I put him the name JV623 once
and in another intent jeppview623, and then I have tried to install the program, in both cases to the moment to 
begin the setup program the following message appears: ERROR: UNRECOGNRED DISK, and the installation finishes.  

2. - The decompressed file  I have copied in a CD (with Nero), to which names jv623, with the same previous 
result: ERROR: UNRECOGNRED DISK, and the installation concludes without results  

Then, where this the problem for my, I have read in the forum that there are people that have had, I believe the same problem 
to install, but there are also others that have not had it. The file definitively is compress with WinRAR and what there is inside 
doesn't seem to be a file ISO. That I should make.  

Thank you again and I hope to have news to be able to have access to the program ........  excuse my English

Regards, Alberto  "
