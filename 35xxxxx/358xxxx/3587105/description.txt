Release Notes:

HELTER SKELTER VS RAINDANCE
HARDCORE 2007

Following the massive success of United in Hardcore
and Hardcore Classics, compilations that sold over
150,000 copies, Ministry of Sound reunite two
hardcore legends to make one of the most exciting
albums in the history of rave.

Celebrating their 17th Birthday this year, London
legends Raindance are known throughout the land for
their consistently amazing parties, which see 3000
nutters go wild at the awesome seOne complex on a
regular basis. The atmosphere at Raindance is
unbeatable, still enjoying the accolade of the UK?s
very first legal all-night rave. Similarly, Helter
Skelter has been rocking the UK since 1989, staging
breathtaking events for up to 18,000 people and
bringing the finest in drum 'n' bass, old skool and
hardcore to the country?s biggest and best venues.

Both promotions are keen supporters of the best in
new and classic hardcore - and this marriage of old
and upfront is what Hardcore 2007 is all about.

This anthem-packed triple CD has been selected and
mixed by the two legends themselves- painstakingly
presented, for a true and totally authentic glimpse
of the scene in 2007.

Slipmatt was responsible for some of the biggest
hardcore and rave anthems of all time (a few of
which are included in the album), while Billy
?Daniel? Bunter has helped to spearhead the hardcore
renaissance with his awesome Tasty events. Both have
been playing at the country?s biggest raves since
the birth of hardcore ? in short, there is no-one
better that could have put this CD together.

Disc 1 is the old made new- 22 classic old skool
anthems and modern dance smashes remixed fresh for
2007 and given the hardcore treatment. Things get
fully pumped up on Discs 2 and 3, with some of the
most exciting, uplifting hardcore from the creme de
la creme of the scene's producers; CLSM, Sy &
Unknown, Robbie Long & Stormtrooper, Squad E,
Technikore, Dougal & Gammer, Styles & Breeze,
Sytronik...all the legends and all the hottest new
stars join forces to bring by far one of the best
Hardcore albums of all time.

66 tracks - the full hardcore and old skool spectrum
? and a ton of exclusive cuts...what better way to
start your 2007 than with a hefty dose of HARDCORE?
