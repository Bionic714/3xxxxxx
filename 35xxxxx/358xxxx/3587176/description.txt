Sorry for the really bad quality, I\'ll upload a better one as soon as I get it.

Really, it\'s almost unwatchable... it\'s actually worse than that, you can only watch it if you\'re really interested in these topics, otherwise you better wait for the divx version... which I can\'t guarantee I\'ll upload ( maybe someone else already did: try to google \'conspiracy of silence torrent\', or look at youtube and google video)

This is a Discovery Channel documentary, never aired on any TV because of politicians not wanting it to. They even used tax payers money to pay for production costs (something between 250000 and 500000 dollars) just to keep *you* fromm seeing the show.
