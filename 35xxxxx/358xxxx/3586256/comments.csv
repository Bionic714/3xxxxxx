,kallekolan,2008-09-09T16:14Z,How do i open the files? Never heard of .cbr or .cbz? What program do I need?
,MasBass,2008-09-09T23:17Z,cbr are in fact rar files and cbz are zip files. if you rename the extensions you can extract the individual image files in folders. the reason they do all this is so ppl can read comic collections in one file and not have many jpgs. you can read them using a cbr / cbz reader like Comical: http://comical.sourceforge.net/
