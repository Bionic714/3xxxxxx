,sowhere,2006-12-26T14:38Z,"hello everyone, well anyway thank to Tarnatos to upload this content, well your torrents (i dunno why) after finished download it , cannot be executed,because your files is VTP6.mz not VTP6.rar, that can be extracted to exe, i suggested to everyone in here to download it form http://www.sendspace.com/file/vksa8k, then wait for 60 second , and download it using regular download (WARNING: DON'T USE A DOWNLOAD MANAGER !!

,thereleas0r,2006-12-26T16:28Z,"why dont you people download it from the official site?

http://www.windowsxlive.net/

its faster and guaranteed to have no spyware or viruses."
,Tarnatos,2006-12-27T10:48Z,"@Todde@Swe
I don't know the bugs on x64. Please contact the author @ www.jcxp.net

@sowhere
I don't know why you have this problems. The seedet file is ""vtp6.zip"" it is the original unchanged file from the sendspace link. Please tell me more about containing adware!!!

@thereleas0r
This is the same release like the one from the official site. Just check the hash id. I provide this webseed torrent to help the author to provide his downloads!

,BongSanvictores,2007-01-03T10:11Z,The official site may be faster but it does not support continuation of broken connections. I have wasted a lot of credits using it. I found that torrents may be even faster with all those nice seeders. Thanks a lot people. Back to watching my download coming in. (drool)
