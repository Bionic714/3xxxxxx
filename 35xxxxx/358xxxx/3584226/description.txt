This release has successfully archived full setup integration support (no more experimental) and add covering on x64 partial support (experimental). Plus, I added many new 3rd-party applications to make your system looks more like Vista such as Styler, Sidebar, Taskbar thumbnail preview, Start orb fix for msstyles, etc. and update many new resources for system files. It's definitely the best release that I ever made!
