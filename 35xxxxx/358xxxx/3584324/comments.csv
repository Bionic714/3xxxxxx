1. Unrar the ISO. Be sure to mount with Daemon Tools 4.x or newer, no particular emulation needed. Install the game. DO NOT run the game after install. VERY important.

If you did this earlier and agreed to installing the StarForce protection files (which it claims is neccasary in order to start the game although now you won't have to) then you are in a heap of trouble (not really, just a figure of speech actually).

I've heard, and experienced somewhat, that if you agree, the protection system penetrates your windows and will not be removed before windows is removed and re-installed. I've done that a few times now, due to the alluring wish to experiment... ;)

2. After you clicked away the install, locate the ""CRACK"" folder on the disc root. Inside you will find bunch of stuff.

All you need to do right now is to locate the one file that says something about extreme (which is the free expansion pack that you can also find here: 
Install the expansion. Once again, DO NOT launch the game, not quite yet.

Jump right back into the CRACK folder again and select all the files. Deselect the expansion-file, which you won't be needing anymore, and copy.

Locate the installation folder and simply paste and choose yes to all when prompted, that you want to overwrite all the files with same names.

And presto - Only one remaining step:

3. Note that you also copied a keygenerator that was also in the CRACK folder (this answers your question by the way). Start it and a screen should appear with a key and a generate button.

Mash the generate button a couple of times, and leave the window open.

UNMOUNT THE IMAGE (important!!), start the game, and it will ask you for a key.

Draw forth the generator. Try to fill in the digits into the designated area untill the OK button appears. This means the key is okay, and all is supposedly good to go.

Ladies and gentlemen, without further ado:

Trackmania Sunrise Extreme with NO-CD crack is up and running! :)"

1. Unrar the ISO.
2. Mount with daemontools or eqv.
3. Install, and DO NOT run the game after install. DO NOT agree to install StarForce protection files.
4. After install, locate the ""CRACK"" folder on the disc root, and install the expansion pack extreme. DO NOT launch the game
5. Go into the crack folder again and select all the files, copy them, and paste and replace them with the ones in the game folder.
6. UNMOUNT THE IMAGE (important!!), start the game, and it will ask you for a key. Use the keygenerator which you just copied to the game directory from the crack-folder.
7. Play

!! IMPORTANT NOTE !! In order for these steps to work, you HAVE to install the Extreme expansion. The NO-CD was obviously made for the Extreme version."
