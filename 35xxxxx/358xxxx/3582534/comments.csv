,Maj_Hoople,2006-12-23T21:30Z,Never did a 'join files' before. Joined the files using HJSplit and ended up with one file...flt-il2s(3.29 GB). Now what do I do? Can't open it and Daemon dosen't recognize it.
,WhiteIce89,2006-12-23T23:09Z,What happened to just using split .rar files? *rolls eyes*

,b17tony,2006-12-26T08:02Z,"Oh one more thing for those of you who don't know this or who are wondering this:

IF YOU GET THIS, YOU NO LONGER NEED YOUR OTHER INSTALLATIONS OF IL-2 ANYTHING, INCLUDING PACIFIC FIGHTERS. THIS GAME INCLUDES THEM ALL, WITH THE ADDITION OF THE NEW STUFF. JUST SO YOU KNOW AND DON'T HAVE 2 INSTALLATIONS OF THE SAME GAME ! ! ! ! "
,Clownie,2006-12-27T21:19Z,"Can you guys even SEED!?, Change your Bitcomet to Azureus.... You aren't sending the file with your bitcomet.... It send's automaticly with Azureus"

,AnarchistBigAl,2007-01-20T23:08Z,"perfect works great :)

probably worth getting a joystick to get the most out of this download though."
,deviant_goof,2007-01-21T14:22Z,sorry for being really thick but how does that work?
,Podgkin,2007-02-09T00:11Z,"I just used WinRar to open the first file - and run setup on Virtual CD...put the .exe in place after.

Sweet! LOL

Nice one! ;-)"
,Lumpydog,2007-02-09T05:30Z,"This torrent worked great for me.  Downloaded at 50 kb/sec, took about 20 hrs.  Let run overnight a couple of nights did the trick.  Downloaded Bit Torrent program to do it, had to open some ports (6969, 6881-6889) on my NAT router.  Extracted all 71 files into one ISO file with picozip, just start extracting the first one and they all go to one large ISO (Image) file automatically.  ""Mounted the Image"" with NERO 6+ to a DVD.  Loaded the game.  Replaced the IL2fb.exe with the one provided and wa-la i'm up and running.  I used the games Direct X updates but they caused some problems.  Much better to go to MS and downloaded thier Direct X componets.  This was awesome, thanks masseur a bunch."
,Jusco,2007-07-24T19:56Z,"Hmz, great. Been looking for this. Gonna leech/seed 24/7. Keep up the seed! :P"

,hijay1,2007-12-03T06:11Z,"hey, im new to all the file joining stuff. So could some please tell me exactly what you have to do to get this game to work : ) Thnks."
,Megamushroom07,2007-12-22T23:53Z,"I'm new to this whole thing....but it stopped responding at 4.3, saying that some file was missing.

Can you shed some light?"
,fishcheese,2008-01-23T18:50Z,"Frankly, I have no idea what I'm doing with this... oh well."
