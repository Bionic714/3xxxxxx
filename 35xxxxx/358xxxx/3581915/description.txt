Josh Groban's 'hands on' approach in the creative process of 'Awake' is reflected in several Groban penned and produced songs along with musical contributions from Ladysmith Black Mambazo, Dave Matthews, Glen Ballard, Eric Mouquet, John Ondrasik Vandrasak, Marius DeVries, David Foster, Imogen Heap and Herbie Hancock.
Awake's 13 new songs including the single, 'You Are Loved (Don't Give Up),' show the Grammy nominated Groban's tremendous growth as a vocalist, producer and songwriter since he first appeared on the musical landscape.
"I learned from touring that my fans are really open-minded, musical, intelligent people and I feel like they want to come on this new journey with me. The music still sounds like it's coming from my heart and my soul and my voice. That is always the most important thing to me. My goal on 'Awake' was to create the music and find the best people to help me create it," - Josh Groban
