                                 Release Notes
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
JFK: Reloaded is a video game recreating the assassination of John F. Kennedy. 
Released on the 41st anniversary of the event (2004-11-22) by Scotland-based 
Traffic Games, JFK: Reloaded puts the player in the role of Kennedy's alleged 
assassin, Lee Harvey Oswald. The player is then scored on how closely one's 
version of the assassination matches the report of the Warren Commission. 
According to the company, the primary aim of the game was "to establish the most 
likely facts of what happened on November 22nd, 1963 by running the world?s 
first mass-participation forensic construction", the theory being that a player 
could help prove that Lee Harvey Oswald had the "means and the opportunity to 
commit the crime", and thus help support or disprove the Warren Commission's 
findings. See you on Dealy plaza//leeker@hushmail.com
