,djoneway2000,2007-08-25T04:29Z,how do you play this download?
,john1801rambo,2007-08-28T19:07Z,I had problems too extracting the files. You need a prog like Filzip - open the zip icon in each folder then right click in the right area and choose extract. It prompt you for a folder then extracts all the files into one movie for each CD file.
,TeknoWire,2007-11-04T00:08Z,"In order to extract the video files, you should use WinRar, much easier. You should also have the xvid  codec installed."

,p_daimaoh,2008-08-27T05:43Z,"Quit using WinRAR on vids that are COMPRESSED... that's the whole point of XviD, don't ya think? To compress a video that you can watch or host. WinRAR on the other hand, you can only host as it requires extraction, which fails if not enough seeders are parking the waste of space RAR on their drive..."
