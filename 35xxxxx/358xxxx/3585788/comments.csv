,Rambo3543,2006-12-31T02:10Z,"This one works, there is a cracked exe that you have to use but it works just fine. My Russian disc is kind of destroyed."
,Rambo3543,2006-12-31T02:34Z,"Command and Conquer Red Alert 2 Disc One, this is the Allied Disc ONLY!! My Soviet Disc is fubard so this one is all I have, this is also all you need to play the Multiplayer and the Allied main game.


1.) Mount this ISO with Daemon Tools and install, the KEYGEN is in the \\\""CRACK\\\"" folder on the disc, run that and generate the key.


2.) When its done installing you still won\\\'t be able to play until you copy the RA2.EXE file from the cd to the harddrive. The file is one the cd in X:\\\\CRACK\\\\crack\\\\RA2.EXE. Copy that file to the following directory:

C:\\\\westwood\\\\RA2\\\\ replace the existing RA2.exe

3.) Run the game and enjoy


PS. DO NOT GET UPDATES OR TRY TO PLAY ONLINE WITH THIS GAME, I WAS ABLE TO FOR A WHILE BUT WESTWOOD CAUGHT ON TO PEOPLE DOING THAT AND NOW IF YOU PLAY ONLINE OR UPDATE THE GAME PAST V1.6, YOU CAN STILL PLAY THE GAME BUT AFTER 10 SECONDS EVERYTHING EXPLODES AND YOU HAVE TO REINSTALL THE GAME.

I will seed this for a while, PM me if you need it seeded some more."

,ptz_,2007-01-10T16:00Z,"Please SEED!!! It stop's after 11.3%.
If you will seed a promice to seed after I download It."
,andreasae,2008-06-06T01:51Z,"Could someone reseed this, please."
,JVisc,2008-09-14T11:11Z,"There is a crack to stop your buildings exploding after 30seconds,
but I believe you need a valid serial key for playing online, or you automatically get kicked.

For playing over networks download a patch from: http://www.understorm.net/cnc/lan/ts_ra2.php
(possibly use Hamachi to have a network over the internet)"
,SharkDay,2009-03-11T05:36Z,Seed plz.... i will seed if i am done but no one seed.....
