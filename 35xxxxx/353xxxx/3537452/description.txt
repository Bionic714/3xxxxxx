                       HOOLIGANS STORM OVER EUROPE

so you might have already guessed, Hooligans is a strategy game based around controlling and improving your very own band of thugs. The game begins with you in control of a small gang of hoodlums. Your first aim is usually to get some cash, by smashing up some of the local shops. Suitably flush, you then proceed to the local public house, where you get your lads drunk and recruit others to your nefarious cause. Weapons can be obtained from weapon shops, with each unit specialising in a particular weapon. Leaders get pistols, with hooligans receiving fireworks etc, and each unit type is useful in a particular situation. Certain units also have special skills. For instance, the Bulch unit has the ability to create and dismantle roadblocks. Bikers can run people over. As well as the hardcore unit, buying rounds in the pub brings supporters to your cause. These units have no special skills, and cannot be directly controlled, but they can tip the balance in your favour during a close battle.

Your units can be improved in several ways. The first and simplest way is to get them drunk at the local ? a double-edged sword, since the drunker they are the harder they are to control. As stated earlier, weapons can be purchased at the local weapon store. Drugs can also be taken to improve fighting ability. Unit?s special abilities are also important to utilise, especially during the tough later missions. Units like the chick and the raver can distract the enemy, and allow you to pick off small groups at a time and exercise a superior numbers advantage over the other gangs.
