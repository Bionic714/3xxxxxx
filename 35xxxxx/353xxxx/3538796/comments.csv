,janus5471,2008-06-30T16:15Z,"Screenplay by David Mamet is brutal and snappy, and the all-star cast is an acting connoisseur?s dream. 

Academy Award winners Kevin Spacey, Jack Lemmon, and Al Pacino; and nominees Ed Harris (nominated 3 times) and Alan Arkin (nominated twice), have all had brilliant careers, some leading up to, some beginning with, Glengarry Glen Ross.

Thank you  - thermalrearrangement"
