,inaj,2006-10-15T18:52Z,Does this work?
,pumbertot,2006-10-15T19:07Z,im sure it installs but no crack. however there is a workaround using virtualcd and alcohol. 
,Timich,2006-10-15T19:10Z,"You will be able to install the game, but if you want to play, you have to wait for the crack. Tages + Xprot protection systems are tough thing...
"
,Timich,2006-10-15T19:11Z,"Also, there are only a few seeders, so download speed is slow.
You can add following trackers to get more peers:"

,Timich,2006-10-15T19:15Z,"What workaround, manipulation with Alcohol 120% and Virtual CD?
This solution, AFAIK, is not reliable."

,Rackem,2006-10-15T23:22Z,"There is a English version out so this is probably it. I know I got my thro rapidshare. But the workaround ONLY works for the German version. I and many more tested it on the English with no success. Installing the game worked fine.

,dampersvin1,2006-10-16T00:53Z,"Hmm still isnt working for me, what version of vcd are you useing ? "
,dampersvin1,2006-10-16T00:54Z,and oh yea that razor crack has been confirmed a trojan on most other sites
,dampersvin1,2006-10-16T01:43Z,"groweren.  can you tell me what steps you did to get this to work, i follow the steps in the german tuturial the the letter, and yet it still doesnt work and yes i have got the german release. i mean just mount the vc6 file and it works or what ?"
,Timich,2006-10-16T02:03Z,"So, does anyone know, how to change savegame path?"
,Knugo,2006-10-16T02:12Z,Timich. Why change the language? Isnt this the english version?
,Timich,2006-10-16T02:26Z,"I was testing a workaround for the German version and found that the language can be easily changed from German to English and so on. 

At least, in game menu. :) "
,John65465,2006-10-16T02:37Z,"I can't get this to work with the German version. The only problem I can see is that whenever I create the VCD8 image, it comes out as .vc4, not .vc6. I just moved in the vc6 file and renamed it as vc4, but that didnt work. I also changed it to make a vc6 file in the options, and then copied it over, but that didnt work either. Are there any more specific settings to have for creating the virtual CD? It just plain doesn't work."
,dampersvin1,2006-10-16T02:38Z,"i dont get it timich, iv removed all my vitual drives in alcohol i dont have any virtual drive hideing progs running, and iv tried to mount the GOTHIC3.vc6 file over and over again and start the game but no luck, it still says i need the cd"
,ReverendMike,2006-10-16T03:18Z,"The seeker of darkness iso installed fine, however, I'm having a prob with starting the game, it say's its got 10 flags, anyone knw wht this is bout? also do I need a crack?"

,Victor_Radu,2006-10-16T07:59Z,anyone knows how to deal with that savegame path thing?
,adymeshter,2006-10-16T10:28Z,"seed...seed..seed please
If anyone has a premium account on rapidshare please give it to me. I want to download from there and then seed it here. I have a 3mbps Internet connection and my upload is something around of 400 KB/s. My email is adymeshter@yahoo.com. Many thanks !"
,Ei8hter,2006-10-16T10:30Z,Now really does this link work's or not ? without any passwords or stuffs like that.
,P4p3Rc1iP,2006-10-16T11:31Z,"*****

If you install the game using this English release (Which will only install but not play), but mount the German release, you can play the English one.

*****"
,Timich,2006-10-16T11:59Z,"No password or serial is required. 

As I have said, current workaround (manipulations with images) is not reliable - Gothic 3 usually starts after 5 - 10 unsuccessful tries (that cursed ""Insert disk"" message from Tages. Xprot component doesn't check game disk, it is a very good exe/dll encryptor and is used to protect Tages code itself.)

Tages official site http://www.tagesprotection.com/main.htm

For those, who cannot start a new game - Gothic 3 saves: http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3540245 

By the way, these saves didn't work for me. If they will not work for those, who have only Latin symbols in savegame path, then the reason is possibly in so called ""Tages decoy function""

,groweren,2006-10-16T14:58Z,How are we supposed to to attach the savegames when we load the games as mounted image ?

,jayheld90,2006-10-16T18:07Z,"well i would be uploading after its done also, but its never going to get done since the original seed/seeds are not uploading anymore. so the full file isnt available. the poster of this is dumb because he didnt continue to seed."
,Victor_Radu,2006-10-16T18:28Z,i hacve a question 4 those of u wht cannot start a new game..does it crash when u press the neues spiel button?
,groweren,2006-10-16T18:40Z,"Yep it crashes. You need to get a save game to run the game properly.. But I myself cant figure our where to put the savefiles...
If anyone know where the save files should be placed in the gothic folder pls tell.
Thx"
,nagorian,2006-10-16T18:47Z,"the savegame files shall most likely be put in 

My Documents/games/Gothic3

or Gothic 3

You may try putting it in a Gothic3 folder directly in My Documents as well.

,groweren,2006-10-16T19:38Z,"THose cracks doesn't work.. at least not for me..

However I can play Gothic 3 now.. with the Virtual CD method described from Timich.. Just follow his steps (AND it doesn't ask you to overwrite the vc6 file iwht the vc4 file. BUT just copy the vc6 file in the folder and delete the vc4 file.)

Now download the savegame and put it into C:\my doccuments\(then into the folder called gothic3)

Run game load the savegame and it works"

It is a true FAKE ...
If you don't beleave it check in the gamecopyworld forums and see...

It seems, that Tages checks actual data on disk. CRC or so. 

The presence of PhysX dlls doesn't mean that the game will get some benefits from using Ageya card. For example, these dlls can be found in 3D Mark 2006 folder, but test results with or without using Ageya are almost identical. 

Quote from Guru3d's article:

3DMark06  - Since Ageia is a program partner in Futuremark 3Dmark 06 we had a look at that as well, we think the Novodex engine is included into he software.. I could show you a couple of benchmarks but suffice to say the scores came out equal on all fronts. There's no way the Ageia cards is helping out this application somehow and neither does it show extre eye-candy.

,Knugo,2006-10-19T02:01Z,"VCD 8 was the confusing part for me untill I learned it. 

This is what i did:
1. Download this torrent, the German torrent called Gothic.3.VCD8CLONE-ST0N3D, the new game patch, savefiles called gothic3_initial_saves.rar (cant remember were i found them, but it was not on this torrent site, search other sites and you will find them), Virtual CD 8 and the GOTHIC3.vc6 file Timich uploaded (http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3540013/Gothic.3.VCD8CLONE-ST0N3D%5B)

2. Install Virtual CD 8.

3. Unpack and mount the English Gothic3 in Alcohol or Daemon tools.

4. Install the game.

5. Put all files from the save game torrent in /my documents/gothic3. If the directory dont exict, create the gothic3 directory in my documents.

6. Patch the game with the official patch.

7. Unmount the game from alc/daem. 

8. Move the GOTHIC3.vc6 file in the same directory as were the German Gothic3 version is.

9. Mount GOTHIC3.vc6 in Virtual cd 8. Its important that you mount it in your physical drive. Yes, that means the CD/DVD ROM mounted in your pc cabinet. Its the cd/dvd device on the top of the list when you right click on the virtual cd 8 icon. Make sure there are no cd/dvd in it when you mount the vc6 file. Dont know how this is manageble, but its briliant :)

10. Hit the Gothi3 shortcut untill the game starts. There will be some error messages before it will start. Insert correct cd and som .dll error. Try again, it will work.

11. When you are ingame, load a game, hit escape button and choose Start new game.

,Grga001,2006-10-19T17:02Z,You mount image into phisical dvd drive by mounting it not on your virtual dvd drive that vcd software creates it but on your phisical dvd drive letter!
,Sargan,2006-10-19T17:02Z,Mount as physical means that you mount it on your real drive. Lets say your real dvd-reader is E: then you mount the image on this E:.
,cruc1al,2006-10-19T17:22Z,"I need some more advice, read on please.

So far I've done the first seven steps of Knugo's guide, except that I've yet to finish downloading the German ST0N3D-VCD version of Gothic 3.

So once I get that, I 
1. unpack it in the same folder with GOTHIC3.vc6,
2. mount GOTHIC3.vc6 with VirtualCD8 to my physical drive letter,
3. hit the gothic3 shortcut as long as it takes to get in the game

Right?

May I ask, why does the GOTHIC3.vc6 file need the German VCD version of gothic 3? Why doesn't it work when you just mount GOTHIC3.vc6 in VirtualCD and that's it?
Because I get an error message if I try to mount  that vc6 file. It says:

""Error inserting/ejecting the virtual CD.

Reason: Invalid drive designator""

Should that error not occur if I have the German VCD unpacked in the same folder with GOTHIC3.vc6? Or is that error about something entirely different?"
,cruc1al,2006-10-19T17:28Z,"EDIT to my above comment:

I get that error message when trying to mount any other virtual image too... What should I do?"
,Knugo,2006-10-19T17:43Z,Umount and restart your computer. Or reinstall the program. I had som bugs with that too.
,cruc1al,2006-10-19T17:46Z,"OK... I got rid of that error message... There was info on the net about how to go around it.

BUT I get another error message:
""Error inserting/ejecting the virtual CD.
Reason: Error opening track file(s)""

I suspect that has something to do with the vc6 file it self, and maybe it works when I have the german VCD gothic 3?"

The very best way to crack this bitch is to look for the ""Gothic 3 Community Patches"" I believe any version of this ""community patch"" that came out after version 1.5 was also designed to break Gothic 3's copy protection :-)

Google for the Gothic 3 Community patches and once you've got the latest installed you should be all set "
