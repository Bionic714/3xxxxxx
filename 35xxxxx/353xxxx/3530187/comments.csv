,Zerojohnnyx,2007-04-09T23:19Z,"I have several questions if someone could help. People on here say they have downloaded things in about ten minutes or so. It takes me a few days sometimes. How exactly do you configure the seeding & everything else to help make it download faster? Some things i download i can't get to play on Windows or whatever media player I have. I was going through some of the comments people leave as feedback on the things they download. One person suggested Azureus. Instructions say if you don't have Java then download that first. Which i did & I could get neither software to run. With Azureus some kind of error occured , could not find class. After i have run either Java or Azureus i can't get either to open. Is there something else i can do to get the things that (namely movies) download to open/play? Any advice please?"
,stevevai1,2007-07-04T20:28Z,How do i get my mouse to work? I have tried everything
,BigBugBite,2008-06-14T04:43Z,"To: Stevevai1 & Pegases
Forget about the mouse guys! Classic Doom should be enjoy with old style keyboard.
It is a DOS game after all.
