little problem.

works fine on laptop, but if i burn it to a data disc, no sound on tv ? 99% of divx's play fine on my player ? why not this one ?

anything i can change in the file to make sound work in divx / dvd player, wife like to watch it on tv."

,Softwarezer,2006-10-03T14:53Z,"venta: The first releases are usually of crap quality, because it is not a group rel. Wait for the HDTV group release by LOL, XOR or hV. It should be up today."

,Cbytes,2006-10-04T01:07Z,"to venta, catchuppp, and gringo steve. Fuck you.

The whole point of this release is because the better guys dont release it immediately after the show airs, or as fast as converting allows. BTW I dont see you posting shit, stfu and please lick my balls."
