,DarthBubba,2006-10-10T04:40Z,"Thanks for the memories!  What a hoot.  I gotta give this a try, just for grins. 

Thanks again!"
,jennysalala,2006-10-10T05:17Z,I'll seed in the morning which is 9 hours from now and I'll seed for 2 days. I promise
,jennysalala,2006-10-10T15:03Z,I agree with you half and half there PhXAnarchy. But if you look on google Windows 3.1 is now abandonware. So go to someone elses torrents like axxo's and say that there.
,ldx94,2006-10-24T03:16Z,"Can someone please seed this.

,black curtian,2006-11-05T15:03Z,"kool thanx i god a buddy thats been looking for this

,black curtian,2006-11-05T16:26Z,ok i could use some help here. what are you using to burn a disk from the ISO. nero says it's an invalid file. or are you just mounting it to the HDD
,DJfatalicus,2007-04-13T21:31Z,"to the two of you that are currently seeding: thank you!

,Jack-Docherty,2007-04-15T03:26Z,"hey guys can we get some seeders thanks

,Mal1024,2007-04-30T14:49Z,This ISO doesn't boot on M$ Virtual PC.
,stocky12345,2007-09-03T15:25Z,is this completely safe?? and would it work in vmware server??
,amgreenhawk,2008-05-29T09:13Z,Thanks for bringing this back. Was looking for this version for a long time.
,Racecar56,2008-07-12T19:56Z,"This isn't bootable, please make it bootable!
I will seed when you do!"
,jennysalala,2008-07-17T09:31Z,"Sorry, should have mentioned this wayyy earlier. Some people have problems with booting the CD so I made the original 7 diskettes available here:
http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3536718/Windows_3.1__7_Floppy_.ZIP_s

It works flawlessly though you DO need a DOS boot disk (preferably 6.22) to boot the Setup.exe on the first floppy. "
,MikeyS9607,2008-08-19T01:20Z,Awesome! Perfect! Thanks sooo much!
,trb93,2008-08-29T08:49Z,dont know why i want it . but i do . will seed
,1bones3,2008-09-11T23:13Z,doesn't boot with virtualbox set to windows 3.1. seems to be a bad iso.
,kragle,2008-09-15T02:49Z,"sweet, cant wait to make stupidly crap music on this platform using my toshiba laptop with no screen and no usb disk. LOL will have to burn everything to disk hah"
,JimmyTheGent,2008-10-15T09:26Z,"Classic!  I hope it works, it has only been over a decade."
,Tahg,2008-12-20T06:25Z,"As an alternative to booting to Win 3.1 you can try DosBox.  Doing it that way, it installs as a regular directory in my Vista 64 filesystem just fine. (Alt+Enter for fullscreen and you'll hardly notice the difference) Nice for the occasional game or program that you love that refuses to run on a more modern OS."
,Eric_Shabaj,2009-01-01T13:08Z,Thank you very much! :)
,Magical_Monkey,2009-02-25T05:17Z,Will this still work if I burn it to a dvd?
,misanthropichud,2009-03-21T00:11Z,"got on here just to find this... thanks so much, wanted to play castle of the winds on my modded xbox! thanks for making my pipe dream realistic!"
,vtrbase,2009-04-26T14:21Z,Another reason why the TPB should be here: it's a time machine!
,ryanmh,2009-06-11T07:13Z,Hmm... I couldn't get the CD to boot. Oh well I'll still seed.
,skulldragon,2009-09-03T05:42Z,"Okay, after wasting 10 hours of my fucking life, I finally managed to install Windows 3.11 on VMware.

Here's what I did:

1. I downloaded an actually working MS-DOS 6.22 from
http://vetusware.com/download/MS%20DOS%206.22/?id=3991

2. Mount disk 1 and do what MS-DOS installation asks.

Now you have fully functional MS-DOS 6.22 required by Windows 3.11.

3. Get a bootable floppy disk image
I used a boot disk from allbootdisks.com - those at that site have CD support!

4. Mount this torrent's Windows 3.11 ISO.

5. When you have booted up with the ""BANANA"" disk, type ""LOCK C:"" - this will allow you to install Win 3.11. Then type ""R:"", then ""Setup"" and follow the instructions on screen.

Now you have fully functional Win 3.11.

But if you want more and if you got brains and PC more than just VMware, then you can try to enable Internet, Sound and save CPU by following this tut:

,klaaso,2010-05-07T18:35Z,i wil seed as mush as posible
,MasonDunne,2010-05-14T05:53Z,"Works great!

Installed it on DOSbox 0.73, installed in a under a minute and works flawlessly!"
,sanved77,2011-04-16T10:09Z,what a fate i getting this for my symbian mobile nokia 5800
