No .nfo so I'll explain everything here. 

 Start off by making a partition on your HDD atleast 80MB with the FAT filesystem (I reccomend using Partition Magic 8). NOT FAT32 because Windows 3.1 doesn't recognize that type. 

 Then boot the CD not from Windows but from your computer start up. Press F12 or Esc to choose Boot from CD-ROM or something similair.

 Follow instructions and choose your new partition when it asks where you want to install Windows on. Installation should be pretty damn quick (took 47 secs to install on mine).

 Then configure some stuff like resolution (don't ask me how to do that) and printers if possible and other stuff. There's tons of drivers and system files out there made specifically for Windows 3.1. Look on google and you'll find USB drivers to DVD drive identifiers which actually let you write on DVD's and CD's.

 The half of you probably won't even bother to read this because you know what Windows 3.1 is and you've used it hundreds of times. This is and oldy that I just decided to throw in for people who lost their diskettes or something happened to their Windows 3.1 set.

 If atleast 100 people download this I might consider putting up Microsoft Works 1991 or 1994 (can't remember the year).

 Some of you are also going to download this and open the ISO and assume that this is a fake because there is not boot folder. Trust me that it's there but hidden. 

 So seed and enjoy!
