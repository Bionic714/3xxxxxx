,rrudolphu2,2006-09-30T04:48Z,"Ursule,
gp here to grab the first3 disks and wait for the 5th. 
It's an amazing serie and the download is worth.
I saw it last 2004 when HBO transmitted it in South America.

same thing happened to me, but after seeing your post, I told myself that the other disks should be somewhere ;)"
