Release info

Rotten Apple is a 2006 album by G-Unit rapper Lloyd Banks. It will be Banks' sophomore album.
While originally intended for a release during the summer, it has been delayed several times 
for a number of reasons (primarily due to lack of airplay and promotion) and is now scheduled 
to be released October 10. The title of the album is a play on the New York City nickname 
"The Big Apple." Banks also wants to show the darker side of New York City, and allow listeners 
to hear what it was like growing up in South Jamaica, Queens.

Early reviews of the album have been average, with the album only garnering a L from Hip Hop 
magazine XXL, which has been fairly friendly to Interscope artists in the past, giving labelmate 
Tony Yayo's debut album an XL despite poor reviews elsewhere. Declaring that "overall, it isn?t 
the new Massacre that?ll shake New York hip-hop down to its core."

The album is to feature guest appearances from 50 Cent, Tony Yayo, Young Buck, Scarface, Mobb Deep, 
Spider Loc, 8 Ball, Rakim and Musiq Soulchild. Production will come from Eminem, Havoc, 9th Wonder, 
and Ron Browz.

Singles to be played on mainstream radio include "Hands Up" and "Help."
