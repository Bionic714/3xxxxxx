,doughboy428,2006-10-06T20:36Z,"I'm almost done with the movie, I'm at a 0.5 upload ratio. When I am finished I will make sure my ratio is a 1.5+ So please seed!!"

,Flash Aron,2006-11-26T09:09Z,"Hi there,

and thanks for sharing.
Have a problem with sound.

1. I renamed the files with only Gladiator and the part which is different ... like

Gladiator_disk1.ts
and so on.

2. I had to delete the Chinese UNDERTITELS, because with them they didn't played.

-> srt Files

3. used ACL to play the 4.5 Gbyte files.

All fine but AUDIO Track 1 didn't play (Seems that is the 5.1 Sound) 
only Audio Track 2 (English STEREO) and Track 3 (Chinese STEREO) is playing.

FIRST QUESTION:
SO HOW COULD I GET MY PC or ACL that it plays that 5.1 Track ?
(My sound card is connected with 3 Cables AND ALSO with electric digital output to the receiver )


SECOND QUESTION:
There are also some files which seems to be senseless. Anyone know for what they are ?

THAT PAR2 Files ? Which player uses them ?
(All in all 6 Files from 56Kb to 128MByte ?)

THANK YOU FOR READING and have a nice day."
,Flash Aron,2006-11-26T09:31Z,"Okay seems I got the IDEA about PAR2 Files ...

Don't rename the Files FIRST you have to INSTALL that programm:

http://www.quickpar.org.uk/Download.htm

Install ist and after that you could start THE FIRST PAR2 File (that without VOL in the name)

After that the program INSERT the missing date into the 5 disk1 to disk5.ts Files ...

The program EVEN finds the renamed files ... so now it is working ... will see what it will do !"

,Fysle,2006-11-27T19:26Z,"Hi

Mmmmm... can someone please tell me/the rest of us how to play this fantastic HD-movie? What program do I have to use, well...., need a ""how to play hd for Dummies"" guidence. Would appreciate that a lot. And yes.., I will seed this for at least 2 months..."
,Fysle,2006-11-27T20:56Z,"Well, I have abour 10 left to download. Anybody who knows if I use the ""add media files"" tool in PowerDVD 7.0, it will play this movie? Please anyone.. answer please.."
,MrG_01,2006-11-29T18:52Z,"Quality on this one is ok, but not exceptional...  (I'm watching on an HDTV 40"")...
Make sure you rename the files to get them to play.  I'll continue seeding this for a while.. but if I see no one d/l'ing, I'll just stop it."
[V],ab029,2006-12-01T10:21Z,Sitter pĂĽ DH nu och seedar i 3-4MB/s...
,Killer.X,2006-12-01T21:26Z,Great big film but its great quality ;) are hopeful to get it down
,benja83,2006-12-10T20:31Z,"I can't access the catalog after downloading, and total commander thinks that the catalog is empty, I can't rename it, nothing... what's wrong?"
,Donald24,2006-12-21T20:19Z,"great movie. i just needed to delete the files other than *.ts. 
BUT nobody will find a DTS-track in there, it's Stereo Chinese, but at least DD5.1 English!

Have fun!"
,Fintelvoodel,2007-01-11T15:38Z,"Play this with VLC.

If you have SB Audigy/Audigy2 and can't get DD5.1 sound, try using KX Audigy drivers, and set it to AC3 passthru."
,Freedz,2007-03-01T22:09Z,"Isn't it DTS-ES 6.1 on this one? or has that been removed...

In the description it says 27,8G but the actual size is 21,7G just wondering"
,Shalimar,2007-03-14T20:51Z,One does have to wonder why UL the TS file insetad of converting this to a HQ 1DVD sized avi in XVID... save one hell of alot of bandwidth (I converted the TS of Serenity and it looks fantastic in avi.. and is 4.5gb instead of 12.4)
,rafaeldb,2007-03-23T21:30Z,"guys i'm confused, I should rename the file to what?"
,rafaeldb,2007-03-24T00:13Z,and you guys are using which player to watch this?
,Shalimar,2007-04-22T19:17Z,"Just to confirm.. this is complete.. working and is DTS audio contrary to what Donald24 posted.

It plays perfectly in MPC and  VLC.  
Just rename the files in sequence:

ie: Gladiator 1080p Proper DTS-ES 01.ts
     Gladiator 1080p Proper DTS-ES 02.ts
     etc

If you get confused as to which file is which just play it and match the scene to the other previous/next one (don't post stupid questions here about such.. a little common sense is all you need).

Also wincmd/total commander work perfectly with this as well.. therefore I say benja83 needs to learn how to use Total Commander."
,T1T4N,2007-09-13T07:35Z,was the source 1080p? or is it a reencode ? thanks
,bebebebe01,2007-10-07T06:55Z,"Shalimar is correct..... DTS sound 5.1.
FULL HD!  NO REENCODE!!
Play it with VLC. Sound divice 5.1. DTS itÂ´s in ENGLISH!!

Audio 10
VIdeo 10
Overall 10"
,griiid,2007-12-09T00:29Z,just a question... is this the extended edition och the original one?

,stateofdreaming,2008-02-16T11:43Z,"So thanks go out to the person nice enough to up this, and equal thanks to the person who provided info on how to rename these so they play one after the other in MPC. I still have no idea what the other files in this torrent are for though. "

It plays in VLC but the default audio track is 1, sound doesn't work under this but if i change it to audio track 2 sound works. How do I get audio track 1 to work or set track 2 as the default??"
