A freshly created VMware image of BackTrack v.1.0
 
http://www.remote-exploit.org/index.php/BackTrack

\"Backtrack security collection is a Live-System based on Slax. With no installation whatsoever, the analysis platform is started directly from the CD-Rom or RAM and is fully accessible within minutes. Independent of the hardware in use, the Backtrack security collection offers a standardised working environment, so that the build-up of know-how and remote support is made easier.\"

This has been installed to a VMware Virtual Hard Drive (4GB uncompressed)for a much quicker response time.

Kernel sources have also been installed just in case you fancy compiling your own bits ;)

The Image will boot to a login screen where you would login as root & if you want the GUI type startx & hit enter (but you already know that!!).

BackTrack does not enable auto dhcpcd.

To get an IP via DHCP, enter the command :

dhcpcd ethX

where ethX is your ethernet card (eg, eth0)

Manual IP Configuration

For manual IP configuration, try the following commands (change the IP\'s accordingly):

ifconfig eth0 192.168.0.5/24
route add default gw 192.168.0.1
echo nameserver 192.168.0.1 > etc/resolv.conf (I did it manually & the above commands all work as stated)
 

user = root
password = toor
