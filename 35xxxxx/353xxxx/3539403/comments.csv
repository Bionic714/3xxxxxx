,audiolord,2006-11-15T07:00Z,Please seed!!! I'm stuck on 98% I have a share ration well above 1
,audiolord,2006-11-16T05:47Z,I would help seed if I could get to 100%. I'm stuck at 99.9%. I even messaged the uploader to see if he would seed a little more so that I can finish.
,rod.smith,2006-11-17T12:02Z,"there are now 6 ppl at 99.9%....

i really really need this file, if anyone has it could they please seed."
,audiolord,2006-11-18T16:39Z,This is totally screwed up!! What does it take for the seeder to finish seeding? Was this an idea for a cruel joke???

,egyptiangod1,2006-11-30T23:42Z,"does anyone know what version this is?  im thinking that i had read that the 15"" mbp's initially shipped with 10.4.5 but now ship with 10.4.6.  and also that the 17"" mbp's shipped with only 10.4.6.  so im thinking that since darkyx said it would not work on his/her 17"" mbp, then it has to be 10.4.5.  or maybe darkyx didnt burn the dvd with disc utility.  is my thinking logical or am i on the wrong track?"
,egyptiangod1,2006-12-02T03:43Z,"heres my problem...got a mbp15 with a bad hard drive. need to buy a new one, its sata but i dont know if there are any more requirements that a mac hdd requires (im guessing pretty much any sata notebook drive would work?). also would i be able to put these 2 discs onto the new hdd (by means of connecting it as a slave to my desktop)? also what is the difference in the 2 discs? after one finishes, does it need the other or is it just optional stuff?"
,Phonecardfree,2006-12-20T05:32Z,I just need that last .01% ... please seed!  I swear I'll seed 'till the cows come home afterwards!
