,delpieric,2006-09-30T23:22Z,Does Lost in Blue work with SD-cards? 'cause the version i downloaded a while only showed a black screen... :(
,delpieric,2006-09-30T23:22Z,(The Japanese version worked)
,NirreFirre,2006-10-01T02:57Z,"Check these pages if you have an M3: http://m3wiki.com/index.php?title=M3_NDS_roms/0101-0150 and http://m3wiki.com/index.php?title=M3_NDS_roms/0151-0200

Lost in Blue (E) (Legacy) GM2.9, FW29, Mini-SD 	(Trim-Rom, 4xDMA, Software Reset) BUT:  

Lost in Blue (U) (Legacy) V2.4 V24 	CF / SD 	(4xDMA, Trim-Rom, NO Software Reset!)

But it depends on the card you use...."
,sv_ea,2006-10-11T21:23Z,"How do I play these games?
Do I need an emulator or is there some way I can play them to my DS?
Thankful for help and advice!"
,lacs1979,2006-10-15T22:51Z,Ok so what sort of memory card should i buy to put these on? I want the easiest one to use and not really expensive.  I live in the uk so i guess ill have to buy it off E-bay or somthing.  Pls help me out here guys.
,Tyralyon,2006-10-15T23:40Z,"My advice would be to buy a DS-Xtreme.
You can check out their forums at http://forums.ds-xtreme.com and buy it either at http://www.modchipstore.com or http://www.foundmy.com

It's a backup system for NDS, a cart that you can put downloaded games on and play. You can even put music or video on it to watch on your DS :)"
,lacs1979,2006-10-16T15:06Z,"Thanks Tyralyon, that looks like a good option, seems they have just become available as they are only on pre-order but i think ill get one."
,XTZGZoReX,2006-10-18T22:21Z,nice one! *dling/seeding*
,MrMuko,2006-10-20T06:28Z,Do these work with emulators?
,lacs1979,2006-10-20T16:01Z,I cant find a decent emulator that plays the games well.  The one i do have( DeSmuME) wont run most of these roms.

,Sedrik,2006-10-28T15:39Z,How can I convert these to .NDS? Or could a torrent with .NDS files be uploaded?
,NirreFirre,2006-10-30T01:50Z,"Sedrik: what's your problem, these are zip files with nds roms in them....? Check your operation system file system settings (to show file extensions) or else I don't know"
,momaniacs,2006-11-01T17:55Z,Try the DS-Xtreme at Consolesource.com http://www.consolesource.com/ecomm/catalog/DS-Xtreme-4GB-DS-X-p-2449.html
,duek,2006-11-01T21:46Z,I'm useing G6 flash   and I can't get the games working   can anyone help me?
,Bigmo,2006-11-22T00:10Z,"I really appreciate this whole discussion about the DS Xtreme, thanks to all who have contributed.  Before I shell out the $125 for it, would someone just confirm that they have downloaded this torrent and sucessfully played the games on this (or another) mod?  Thanks!"
,Bigmo,2006-11-22T18:36Z,"Scratch my last comment.  I did a BUNCH of research and DS Xtreme is clearly a good purchase (but beware of the ""4 gig"" claim - as many will tell you, it's GigaBITS not GigaBYTES.  It's not huge but still better than the other options.  The best review (and reviewing site) is http://gbatemp.net/.  You need to sign up to read the DS Xtreme review, but it's free and well worth it."

,Wlffrsether,2007-04-23T16:24Z,"I'd recommend the M3 Simply (which uses seperate microSD-cards). It's the same size as a normal DS cartridge with an built-in passcard, so your DS won't get big and bulky. So far, all the games I've tried have worked ""out of the box"" with no need for patching."

,Timewarptwo,2009-10-05T00:22Z,I used an Acekard2 DSi which is a slot 1 card from www.acekard.com it works in the DSL and the DSi (I have both consoles and 2 of these cards) I use both of them with a 4GB micro SDHC memory card each. This slot 1 card can utilize up to a 32GB Micro Memory card. I only paid $26.00 for each card and about $6 or $7 for each micro memory card on Ebay. They offer EXCELLENT support. I highly recommend this slot 1 card. Programs load fast and there is no slowdown or speed lag like other cards. Just drag and drop your games onto the memory card. Also you don't have to flash your consoles firmware so it doesn't void your warranty. These are not clone cards. On the Acekard web site they have recommended sellers and I chose a USA seller but they list sellers for all over the world. I am no way affiliated with Acekard. I am fairly new to this concept of slot 1 cards so I was very sckeptical. This card was so easy to set up and use I bought 2 of them. I LOVE this card so much I just wanted to share these with you.
