,boredbypolitics,2006-10-16T01:33Z,"It is being seeded, although unfortunately I'm an Orange ADSL customer, and so suffer from various disconnects and overall poor service quality, so it's taking a while to get it out there.

I've currently got 4 peers connected downloading, with 5 total in the swarm.  The more the merrier!"
