David Wilkerson were in Sweden in May 2004 and preached a very strong message about the swedish christians being filled with apathy. It's a very strong message from a watchman and prophet. There is also follow up interview with Wilkerson from spring 2005.

The follow up interviews have swedish subtiles. (2-3)
The fourth file is only the sermon in speex file format.

I first upload them in ogg/theora and speex. They are encoded with default setting, which means audio quality 1 and video quality 5, with the resolution 352x288. If there is an interest i may upload them in a better format.
