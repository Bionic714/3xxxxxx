Welcome to XMugen II: Double Impact

This is an easy to use XMugen distribution that contrains both GuyBird's Slim Menu Direct Boot and the 4.5 version of GenTooX bundled together in 1 package.

Also included is a very detailed instruction manual on what you need to do to add your own screen packs, and some premade files to help you get going faster.

I will eventually post my screenpack collection and my personal Config.xml file, which differs slightly from this, in another torrent. Do not talk about it in any of the XMugen related sites, please.

Seed like crazy.
