Spain 1982 Color 100 mins

Only spanish DVD exist with spanish subs only;so I\'ve searched the ebay and found this VHS tape burned on DVD.Picture quality is not great,but is still wachable and english subs are available as CC.So long there\'s no international DVD version this one will do.The only movie left from Almodovar collection is The Holy Girl which I\'ll upload on sunday.

And don\'t forget the usual stuff like seeding.....
