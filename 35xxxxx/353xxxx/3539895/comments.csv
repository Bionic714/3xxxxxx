,Evil Bastardo,2007-06-14T02:54Z,"Attention All Downloaders:

I personally seed all my torrents between the hours of: 11:00pm - 7:30am Central Time, USA, every night, 7 days a week.

I only have a dial-up connection so please excuse the ""F""ing slow upload pace.

This is also available in MP3 only format, to increase upload speed. (See my other torrent)"
,Evil Bastardo,2007-09-23T04:43Z,"Ahhhh! Faster Upload Speed!!

Now At slowest DSL connection, so you should see some improvement.

Still seeding during my regular hours and sometimes more during morning and weekend
hours."
,pirate04kitty,2008-02-06T05:01Z,please seed.
,pdabber,2010-05-07T19:26Z,"In your torrent you requested Head East/Head East!
My first attempted upload is in response to your request. I have been a fan of Head East for a very long time. I posted what I have in my archives under the title Head East collection today. One good turn deserves another! Thanks
