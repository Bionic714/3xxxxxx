,alkohol222,2008-06-17T16:49Z,"Installation was no problem, but when i start the game it always shut down and my pc reboots automaticlly, wheres the problem???"
,MagnusGL,2008-06-18T16:53Z,"Okay, for those who DIDNT read the description: It is not online, it is LAN only. You can play with bots or friends at LAN, but you CANNOT (no, seriously) play online with this one. Only way to play CS online is to buy it."
,qbrtux,2008-11-24T15:34Z,"As a matter of fact, If it is a LAN version you CAN PLAY ONLINE, but you will need a LAN-emulator, like Hamachi.

I have not tested it yet, though."
,qbrtux,2008-11-26T07:32Z,"rofl, It is playable online... but I am having a bit of a problem though. I played two maps online that i had to download and now i cant see my ""original"" maps when I try to host a game."
,Holo_no,2008-12-18T14:27Z,"Eid. Skal laste ned og flytte den over til den andre PC'en. Har kjøpt CS 1.6, men må ha en LAN versjon på den andre, så kan jeg eie kompisene mine, vettu ;)

Lol, noen som har prøvd aim_porno? XD"
,Siiiver,2011-09-18T17:32Z,"Awesome! :D
