The collision of sounds, deep rooted in Southern Rock mixed with modern inspirations of The Black Crowes and Stone Temple Pilots, come together in the sound of The Lugnuts. 

The Lugnuts busted into the Midwest music scene in 1996 with brothers Ken Kasik (24), Zach Kasik (21) and Carl Collison (22) creating a blazing live show that people had been longing for. The Lugnuts played around their hometown of Yankton, South Dakota for 8 years developing their sound and writing songs that would someday form the now completed debut album, "Rhythm And Booze". 

Enjoy The Ride...
