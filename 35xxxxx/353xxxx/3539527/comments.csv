I just moved to Korea and was searching for anything by Kim Ki-duk. I saw Spring-Summer-Fall-Winter-Spring a few years back and loved it. That's basically all I knew about Korean film, or even Asian film. I came across this torrent and now have a whole new horizon to check out. That's the beauty of file sharing. Money doesn't buy this kind of tribal connection. "
