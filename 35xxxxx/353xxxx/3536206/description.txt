Fly Using Road Reference Points Coast to Coast 

Designed to raise Flight Simulator 2004 to new heights of realism, USA Roads for Microsoft Flight Simulator will bring your flying experience alive with nearly every road in the continental USA, from surface streets in your neighborhood, to the major roads, highways, and more. Interchanges, ramps, access roads, are all included. The entire continental United States (with the added extra of Hawaii) is covered in super high detail, with millions of miles of roads.

The product uses precision proprietary mapping data to provide highly accurate road layouts. Divided roadways and highways are displayed in their correct positioning for both sides, not just as a single line using a divided road texture. You will see roads the way they are supposed to look! This is invaluable for those VFR flights where you need road and highway landmarks to help you navigate. Now you can take off low and slow in the Piper Cub from the tip of Florida, across the central plains, up through the northwest mountain regions, and all the way to Seattle, with just USA Roads and a road map.

USA Roads have been carefully optimized for FS2004 to have little impact on performance, and to blend in nicely with existing scenery textures, land class, and terrain mesh. USA Roads include their own texture set. New daytime textures brighten up concrete roadways and blend in with the urban land class textures. New night textures provide more accurate looking street-lighting effects.
