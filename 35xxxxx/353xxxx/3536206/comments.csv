Can someone please help?"
,Citrusloka,2006-10-14T13:27Z,"Come on...seed plz...stuck at 32,8% for days now."

I thought about seeding my copy but I could not see how it could be done so the torrent would run.

It is a nice piece of scenery, exactly as described but the roads and freeways are a little on the light side.
