Tracey Ullman - You Broke My Heart In 17 Places

Original 1983 album.

Includes all the earlier hits, \'Breakaway\', \'They Don\'t Know\', \'Move Over Darling\' etc.

Also included is the video for \'They Don\'t Know\' & a live performance of \'Breakaway\'.


Ripped from vinyl, so sound is very good, if not excellent!

Re-live those 80\'s memories!
