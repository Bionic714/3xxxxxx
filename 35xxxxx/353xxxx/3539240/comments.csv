The worse are the people who download and don't upload jack. You are a disgrace to the community. "

,RamiusLupin,2006-11-25T11:24Z,"The movie was fantastic.  It was a little drawn out and rather sad, but it was a good story.  Infact, I believe it was based on a true story.  How freakin cool is that?"
,skeebz,2006-12-08T23:53Z,I have seen this in the theater..now I must see it on my computer screen.  Great movie.  Must upload & seed!
,ticktock_man,2006-12-15T04:40Z,"kindof slow-paced, but an excellent movie.

i have no idea what quality this particular torrent is (i downloaded another  one  many months ago), but the movie itself is highly worth watching. my g/f never likes martial arts movies and hates jet  li with a passion, and she even liked it."
,conga,2006-12-24T01:02Z,good movie! the subs are much better to another one that i had. thanks!
,datelinenbc,2006-12-24T17:32Z,"Pay it forward people.  If you cannot pay it forward 3 times, please do not download.

By paying it forward, I mean, upload 3 times for every 1 time you download.  

If you're ISP is on your case about uploading movies, visit  www.findnot.com, it's only $10/month."
,uraphake,2007-01-04T05:34Z,"Findnot might be suitable for ""normal"" activities, but not for BitTorrent. They will actually turn you off if they consider you a ""bandwidth hog"" by using BitTorrent to connect to more than a few people.

The solution? http://www.relakks.com
It's cheaper and does have certain limitations but I've used it for downloading with BitTorrent and it gets the job done. I also would trust them more than a company which logs (like findnot) and acually has a server in the U.S. I don't trust anything for ""anonymity"" which is inside of the United States. I live there and know better. You should too."
,lilh6,2007-11-22T15:19Z,i didn't download this.. but you do more reading than watching... you should've ripped it with english audio
,xkexkexke,2008-02-02T10:00Z,"In this movie Jet Li,who is Huo Yuanjia, became famous fighter (martial 
artist) in all China.
Huo Yuanjia's father did not wish for his child to follow in his 
footsteps,but Huo Yuanjia resolves to teach himself how to fight - and 
finally win. Daily training enable him to ace match after match in his 
home region of Tianjin. After an ill-advised fight leads to another 
master's death, members of Huo's family are slain in revenge. Grieving 
and ashamed, Huo wanders the country in shock. Near death, he is 
rescued by women from an idyllic village, and is offered simple 
kindness and generosity that help him heal and regain his equilibrium 
over a period of several years. Huo realizes that the future of martial 
arts lies in sportsmanship and not brutality, and he rejoins society to 
apply what he has learned. Huo Yuanjia returns to Tianjin, takes steps 
to come to terms with his past and finally restores his family's 
name............For more information go to
