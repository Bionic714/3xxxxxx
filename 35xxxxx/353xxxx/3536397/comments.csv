Not good.  When flying if I right click it brings up options menus.  None of the option text is visible.  Only blank options panels.  It's either the crack that's faulty or the entire sim x razor packed files are screwy.

The game control menus work fine. But the all important in-flight menus are blank.  Understand?

Anyone else found this problem?

Just because you're stupid and obviously lack of simplest computer knowledge doesn't mean that others are as stupid as you... If you can't handle simple things as Graphic settings then stick to wanking that you have most experience in.."
,feathers632,2006-10-14T13:59Z,"I've just reinstalled this Razor1911 release in the hope that I could get the in-flight options menus to display their text.  It's a waste of time.  When you're in flight you should be able to see game options when you right click mouse.  This razor release is fucked.  The menu panels appear but there is no text.  There is another serious bug as well... Your aircraft has it's wheelbrakes permanently ""on"". Pressing ""."" should release them.  It doesn't.

I don't know if these problems are caused by the razor disc packing or the no activation crack?

The bottom line is that this repacked razor release is fucking useless.  Don't waste your time downloading it.

,badeyeuk,2006-10-14T15:30Z,"feathers632 your obviously a gimp who knows fuck all about downloading games and them to work coz i have downloaded razors version of FSX and it works fine, there isnt 1 single problem with it!! ive installed it on 2 PC's and it runs perfect as well as online too.
So until you sort yourself out with a half decent computer and the knowledge of knowing what the fuck your on about shut the fuck up!!!

When I ran the Sim X demo last month there were no problems with in-flight options menus.  I install illegal pirate games all the time and I don't have probs.  I only have probs with this particular razor release. 

My PC is water-cooled and overclocked and runs very well.  I got a BFG 7900gt overclocked by 80mhz and water-cooled.

I think I know how to install a game.  Like I said, when I installed the pre-release demo last month it didn't have any problems at all.

,Puck7845,2006-10-15T13:28Z,"Hey feathers632, when you say water cooled do you mean the processor has a closed water cooling system, or the CPU and the motherboard, or does the whole setup have a circulating tube system that links to an external pump/heat sync tower? How fast is your processor, the fact that its water cooled doesn't mean its good. How much RAM does you video card have? How much RAM is on your MB? what type of RAM are they (DDR3 SDRAM for example)? Oh and it's comprendeS, with an s."
,feathers632,2006-10-15T14:13Z,"Ok.

Most of my water system is external.  I use an Eheim 1048 pump which is submerged in the coolant in a custom waterbox (approx 8"" x 6"" x 6"" high).  My radiator is actually a small radiator taken from an AUDI car.  It has 2 x 120mm fans sucking air through it.  I got a Polarflo E waterblock on my P4 630 3ghz which is overclocked to 4ghz.  My motherboard is an ASUS P5ND2-SLI Deluxe and both North and Southbridge chips..."

I was intending to switch to Core Duo months ago but I couldn't decide on a motherboard.  I've now downloaded the BLUESCAN version of Simulator X (via this site) and applied the Razor dll crack.  I still can't get the in-flight menus to show text (all the menu panels are blank).  It's either the crack or maybe I need to update my videocard drivers (I suspect that won't help). When I tried the demo last month, the in-flight menu text worked fine."

When fonts don't display in-game, Microsoft suggest checking the fonts in windows fonts folder.  There are no fonts missing.  Both installs of XP are using the same video drivers so what's the problem?  Why do the in-flight menus display properly on one XP and not the other? (both installs of XP are from the same CD).  I will try to solve the puzzle.  Finally I must apologise to Razor1911 for saying their Sim X release didn't work.  It works fine!"

""This disc contains a ""UDF"" file system and requires an operating system
that supports the ISO-13346 ""UDF"" file system specification.""

I am running XP Pro SP2.  What am I doing wrong?"
,peterjung,2006-11-02T12:07Z,DVD2 mounts with no problems...can anyone help?
,peterjung,2006-11-04T08:21Z,"PROBLEM MOUNTING DVD1? - SOLUTION

For several days I have been having big problems in getting FSX to install.  I now have a fully installed and working version.

First the torrent from where I downloaded the working version is:

http://torrents.thepiratebay.org/hashtorrent/3536572.torrent/MicrosofFlighSimulator_X_Deluxe-Razor1911_(_DVD1_REPACKED).3536572.TPB.torrent

This download will give you two folders named DVD1 & DVD2 and an NFO file.

The two folders each contain a DVD image file in ISO format.

When I first tried mounting the DVD1 ISO file I ended up with only a single text file on the virtual drive.  When I opened this text file is says:

?This disc contains a ""UDF"" file system and requires an operating system 
that supports the ISO-13346 ""UDF"" file system specification.""

The result is the same using the very latest versions of both Daemon Tools and Alcohol 120%.

Despite finding a solution for this problem I am still not sure why some seem to have the above problem and others do not.  It is an issue with the particular Win XP install I suspect.  If anyone can enlighten me I would be very grateful.

To get around this problem you can use the Microsoft Virtual CD Control Tool as follows:

Get the programme from the following link:

http://download.microsoft.com/download/7/b/6/7b6abd84-7841-4978-96f5-bd58df02efa2/winxpvirtualcdcontrolpanel_21.exe 


1. Unzip the download 
2. Run the program file named VCdControlTool.exe from where you unzipped the files in step 1. 
3. In the ""Virtual CDRom Control Panel"" window, click on the ""Driver Control..."" button 
4. In the ""Virtual CD-Rom Driver Control"" window, click on the ""Install Driver..."" button 
5. Choose the file VCdRom.sys from where you unzipped the files in step 1. 
6. In the ""Virtual CD-Rom Driver Control"" window, click the ""Start"" button and then ""OK"" button 
7. In the ""Virtual CDRom Control Panel"" window, click on the ""Add Drive"" button 
8. In the ""Virtual CDRom Control Panel"" window, select the drive that was added instep 8 and then click on the ""Mount"" button 
9. Browse to the location of the ISO image file (?/download path?/DVD1/rzr-fsxf.iso) and select it by clicking in the Open button 
10. In the ""Special Mount Options"" window, click the ""OK"" button 
11. In the ""Virtual CDRom Control Panel"" window, click on the ""OK"" button 
12. Windows Explorer will now show a new drive that contains the contents of the ISO image. 

You can now run the setup.exe from DVD1 to start the installation.

Around halfway through the installation you will be prompted to insert DVD2.

Go back to the Virtual CDRom Control panel and click ?Eject?.  Then mount the DVD2 image in the same way.

The installation will then go on to complete.

Skip the registration screen.

Go to the mounted DVD2 image and in the folder Razor1911 you will find a file called crack.rar.  Extract this and copy the three dll files to:

C:/Program Files/Microsoft Games/Microsoft Flight Simulator X/

Overwrite the existing dll files.

Run the game and everything should work fine.

This worked for me.  The big problem was figuring out why the DVD1 image file would not mount properly."

,Velkator,2007-06-04T22:27Z,"More or less a reply to DRAKILY's solution, but also a question to you all.

I quote you:
""1.RENAME the ""/rzr-fsxr.001"" file

to ""/rzr-fsxr.rar""

2.Extract the .rar file over the ""/rzr-fsxr.002"" ""

for this to work as a rar archive each every file after the .rar needs have be .r00 - .r01 - r02 etc. And most importantly, there needs to be a .r00 file, in this archive it starts from 001. So it's all a bit confusing.

I'm not the most competent guy around here, but I've extracted quite a few games in the past.

And btw, could you please elaborate what you mean by ""2.Extract the .rar file over the ""/rzr-fsxr.002"" ??

It's all good and thanks for the help.
