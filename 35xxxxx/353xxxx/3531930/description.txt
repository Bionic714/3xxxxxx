\"Some amuse us, others terrify us. They slither, swim, walk and crawl, leap and lunge, and some spend their entire lives contained within a shell. Their ranks include some of the most skillful predators on Earth. And their long-departed dinosaur ancestors are an unending source of fascination to humanity, both in fiction and scientific endeavor. They are \'The Reptiles,\' the fascinating subjects of a four-part NATURE miniseries.\" 

Part 2 - Snakes 

\"The Reptiles\" continues with a look at the reptiles that humans may fear most: \"Snakes.\" But the film does not portray snakes as evil creatures. Rather, it takes us into their secret and very strange world to try to understand them better. Even though most snakes are not lethal to humans, many people are still terrified of these slithering reptiles. The program illustrates how venomous snakes bite humans only in self-defense and would much rather not confront us. Snakes also provide a valuable service by controlling the rodent population.
