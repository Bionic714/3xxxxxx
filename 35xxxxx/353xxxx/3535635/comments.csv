Apparently you must start the game through the autoplay screen that comes up when you load the image for some reason... when you try to start the game any other way you still get the copy protection. No idea why this is, but there it is.

,Hatshe,2006-10-11T18:13Z,"Hey,

I followed the instructions, but I can't seem to load the game anyway, even with all options selected in the laterst daemon tools version. I keep getting an error message about a securom conflict. I've also tried using the german patch 1.16, but with no luck. Any ideas what I can do?"
,Ma++,2006-10-13T17:32Z,"You have loaded the game through the the autorun screen that comes up when you load the image rather than the icon you get when you install the game? And have you changed the stuff in config.ini and loca.txt back to english as it was before? Shouldn't be a problem then, as I've patched to 1.16 myself (which by the way in my case fixed the memory leak completely) and I can still run it..."
,vladzzz,2006-10-13T21:00Z,"it worked for me,but the portraits are black.anyone has this problem?1.15"
,Cower,2006-10-18T14:38Z,Try updating your display drivers. That usually solves problems like that.
