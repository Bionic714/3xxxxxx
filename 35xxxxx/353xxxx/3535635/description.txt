I've had a lot of trouble (me and the rest of the world it seems) to get this game to work, and I can honestly say that there's no playing this game without patching to at least v.1.15 (stops the crashing, but apparently it doesn't do a lot to fix the memory leak later in the game which causes annoying freezes/slowdowns), but at least you can play longer than 5 minutes ;). This worked for me:

1: apply included patch 1.00 -> 1.11

2: open config.ini in your root directory and change the following 

// Language for localization
Language = "english"

to

// Language for localization
Language = "german"


3: go to the "Resource" directory, open loca.txt and change the following

ENG to GER


This allows you to apply the german patch to your english installation. Note that you only have to do this with an English game.

4: Now apply the included 1.11 -> 1.15 patch

5: After applying the patches, undo the changes you made in steps 2 and 3.

6: mount the included mini image in Daemon V.4.06 (latest), turn on all emulation options and you\'re good to go (without crashing after 5 minutes without fail I might add).


I stress that this is not something I made, I just collected the parts and information from various websites; regrettably I can't remember who did make the img or I would give them due credit for it... Just thank whoever takes the trouble of helping people like you and me out in times like these eh ;)
