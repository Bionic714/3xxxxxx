Last performances from Didjits, Scratch Acid and Big Black in almost 15 years.  Includes fireworks and actual kind words from Albini during Big Black set, complete with Sears Tower from Chicago skyline in background. Only a few songs of each set was recorded except Big Black was recorded in it's entirety.  Audio is mostly bad and video shaky at times.  Highlights are Big Black, Shellac and Pinback all with better quality audio/video than most other recordings on DVD.
