,DataPumpHer,2006-10-25T09:07Z,"I'm suspecting that ZD Recorder was allowed to check for updates immediately after installing?  This may be why your reginfos aren't working. 

Uninstall, reinstall, disallow checking for updates when asked at the end of installing, and use these reginfos:

,Cmon seed,2007-03-19T15:43Z,I cant watch the video i almost have every codecs in the world! and its slows the game like hell!
,DataPumpHer,2007-03-27T11:07Z,"""Cmon seed"" have you tried other codecs to use for encoding (in ZDGR's options/settings?) 
""Auto"" or ""Default"" isn't always the best choice for every system, you may have to experiment a bit. It could be-that your current selections just aren't up to it.  
Also, avoid 'jacking up' the quality settings too high, such as with sound and desired frame-rate since these can easily produce the symptoms you describe.
What game are you referring to, anyway?  Have you tried recording in other games with same/similar results?"
,zateh,2007-06-04T05:42Z,will the same licence code work for the screen recorder as well? 
,DataPumpHer,2007-06-21T07:44Z,"
Screen Recorder & Game Recorder do NOT
use interchangeable license code infos
to my knowledge!

ZD Soft SCREEN Recorder v2.6.4.0
================================
Download from zdsoft.com ""SRSetup""
After DL, right click on it, Properties
Top- Click the Version tab--  
Check to make sure the file version says 2.6.4.0!

License code:
Name: Twisted EndZ
Code: FPAE-NDIF-OVGP-VRTX

*Copy and paste each segment of the code
separately and watch out for trailing spaces
otherwise your license code will not work!
*The reg-name IS case-sensitive!"

,iLoveGamez,2011-06-11T21:07Z,How big are the video files once you have recorded them? Because on Fraps 6 minutes got to 2.82 Gib for me.
