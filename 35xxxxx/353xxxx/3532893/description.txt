This is a replacement torrent for stuck downloaders of the short lived torrent at: 
http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3531920/ZD_Soft_Game_Recorder-better_than_fraps__Complete_with_keygen

Unless the above mentioned torrent uploader included 6 keygens @ 200kb each or just 1 keygen + some bonus family vacation pics from summer this year, something was very odd about its filesize being almost an exact double of what it 'should' or 'could' have been.  

At any rate, here's a complete & %100 working copy (installed/tested prior to posting)  Game On!

  How It Works?  
Run ZD Soft Game Recorder before running the PC game you want to record. It runs in the background. It automatically detects which PC game you are running in the foreground. After you press the hotkey to start recording, it grabs every frame of the game, compresses the frame data in MPEG4 format and stores the compressed data to a video file. It also captures, compresses and stores the audio data of the game to the video file if the audio recording option is enabled. Everything is done in real-time. The video file is automatically named bases on the executable file name of the game you are recording. Press the same hotkey again to stop recording. Then the game video is finished. ZD Soft Game Recorder is now ready for a new recording.
