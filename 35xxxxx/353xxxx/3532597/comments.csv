,4X-MAT,2006-10-02T15:11Z,"Any known problems with this AIRAC cycle? 
The previous one - 0609 - fucked up all the info, I couldn't use SIDs/STARs and I couldn't see the runway on the navigation display..

For the mean time I will download it and seed, thanks man :)"

,raptor22,2006-10-02T17:14Z,"^^ rofl, do you think B744 just thought hed seed a free easly available AIRAC cycle just too waste his bandwidth? this is the payware version, very good may  I add, there new source is 110x better i used this cycle and the sids/sytars for the lesser known airports where way more accurate"

,biker9075,2006-10-09T22:53Z,"Bad news guys, I was just looking on the navdata forum and found this :

""In the near future you can expect following:
I create one universal database, which is binary coded. The addon-producer can than request a DLL, .net component, ... from me with which they can read out and use the binary coded information (ie. via gauge, ...).
Second, each universal AIRAC cycle have an own license file, which will downloaded and installed automatically with the setup to avoid some sharing and which will be checked with the DLL. ""

Hopefully someone will still be able to crack it."
