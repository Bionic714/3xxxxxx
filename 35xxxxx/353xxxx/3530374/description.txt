Description: An iconoclastic biopic about the adventurous 17th century late-Renaissance painter Michelangelo Merisa da Caravaggio, who was born in 1573 and died in 1610. The Baroque artist is superbly played by Nigel Terry and the story is brilliantly adapted to the screen by English director Derek Jarman. It is very sensually done, emphasizing the artist's gargantuan appetites for bisexual and, especially, homosexual affairs with his models, the various scandals he was involved in---including murder and his tricky dealings with the church. It was filmed on a very restricted budget which only proves if you know how to shoot a film, you can do it on shoestring budget and still come up with an outstanding film.
