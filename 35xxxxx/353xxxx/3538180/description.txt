Miko Mido, the endlessly pliable heroine of LA BLUE GIRL, is back and ready for more action/abuse in this iteration of the LA BLUE GIRL series, only this time she\'s portrayed by a live actress instead of rendered by an artist\'s pencil. The DEMON KING saga began one thousand years ago, when the women of the Miroku Clan were forced to take up arms against a race of lustful beasts known as the Shikima. Fast forward to the present, one thousand years later when the Shikima have returned to Earth for revenge, taking every young woman they can find to be their their own personal plaything. Enter Miko Mido, the fearless descendent of the Mirokus, who must overcome the Shikima\'s demon sex magic in order to avoid becoming their slave and so that she can rid the Earth of these unclean beasts once and for all.
