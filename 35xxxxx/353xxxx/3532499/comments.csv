,reatta32,2006-10-02T19:18Z,"YES.

You'll need to create a new Logical partition first using Partition Magic or Acronis Disk Director.  Once you've created a new partition.

Boot from the XP_JACKED CD and specify that you want the installation on the new partition you just created,

After JACKED installs, when your computer first starts up (Pre-Windows) you'll be prompted to choose which OS to boot into.  (The most recently installed OS is on top--JACKED).  

Good luck"

,janaltus,2006-10-09T03:48Z,"Grateful 'tho I am for all your hard work, reatta32, (this program might just help get back my life's work on dead PC) - one word of contructive criticism, if I may.

This ISO comes out as 469,112 KB.  But the most I can burn onto a CD (as an ISO) is about 450,000 KB.  Is that just me - or is it common??  If it is common, would it be worthwhile trimming the size of this version just ever so slightly?

If it is just me - and I should be able to write bigger ISOs to CD - then apologies - and I'll try to see how to write bigger ISOs ... tho' I don't know yet!"
,janaltus,2006-10-09T09:00Z,"Wow! This is fantastic! Please ignore my comments (above) I was talking through my hat (four nights without sleep, you see).  Now I can sleep - thanks to you.  You are a lifesaver! Many thanks!"
,Fum3tsu,2006-10-15T09:51Z,"Is it possible to get all the drivers back? I cannot for the love of god install even the most basic of things due to the lack of internet and networking.
