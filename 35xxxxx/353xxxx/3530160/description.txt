It's the 1960's.  Germany won WWII and it's Hitler's 75th birthday.

"Fatherland" shows a world where Nazi Germany won the Second World War after repulsing the Allied invasion at Normandy. Now, in the 1960's, Germany continues to fight a bitter guerilla war with the Soviet Union and desperately needs an alliance with the United States in order to finally beat Stalin's war machine. However, when local SS-homicide detective Xavier March begins investigating the mysterious death of a Nazi Party Official, a coverup is revealed involving the Jewish Holocaust of World War II. With the assistance of an American journalist, March probes deeper and discovers the full truth about what happened to the Jews; a truth that could destroy the peace process with America and a truth that Nazi and SS leaders will stop at nothing to keep hidden.
