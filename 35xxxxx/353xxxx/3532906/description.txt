This is not an offical cast recording of "Evil Dead 1 and 2 the Musical"
nor am I in any way affiliated with this production.

This is a bootleg recording made at the Just For Laughs comedy festival
in Montreal, Quebec, Canada back in 2004.

Some tracks did not come out well and were replaced with the same track
from the second run at the Tranzac Theatre, 292 Brunswick Ave., 
Toronto, near Bloor and Bathurst just East of Honest Ed's on 
October 29, 2003.

Note: The cover art was made from scratch from a friend.  Don't kill
      yourselves trying to find it on the internet.

I hope you enjoy it until an official cast recording comes out.

I hope this whets your appetite to see the real thing at the
New World Stages, 340 West 50th St., New York City, New York, U.S.A.
