,amoren,2006-10-05T16:31Z,"U are welcome m8, but i dont take credits for it though..
I simply put them all together so its not 5 small files but a -all in one pack- ;)"
,Uberbitch,2006-10-05T16:58Z,"Awsome, thanks a bunch for bunching them all together... (:"
,galemann.,2006-10-05T18:13Z,Does every episode has great quality in this release??? the file size seemed to indicate so.... If you're sure every episode is great quality then this is definately one for the collection..  :)
,amoren,2006-10-06T00:12Z,"Well i havent seen them all, but them i have seen (about 80-85%) are in good quality.. so the rest (15-20%) should also be in goog condition;)

But i had some probs when i played it in my wm-player ,theres was no sound comming out the speakers :(
BUT in vlc-player there was no problems at all.. "
,galemann.,2006-10-07T00:28Z,"You should try DivX Player 6.3 dude.......... I compared a tv show file once.. Both started at the samt time in DivX Player and VLC player and i garantee you that in DivX player the quality was ALOT better then in VLC..., VLC is good for playing some files that many other players wont play, but for avi divx xvid (and many other ofcourse) DivX Player is your best choise for optimal quality...,"

Another story, how do i update an torrent without making a whole new one??
Example =If i now upload a movie and have at torrent for it , and one day i get a cover for the movie and want to include it into the torrent, how the hell am i gonna do that??
Is that possible in any way to update a torrent?"
,galemann.,2006-10-22T23:20Z,"Im not sure, but i saw that you had put up an entire new torrent with Futurama season 1-5 (big pack) + dvd covers.. It would be much easier to just upload a new torrent with the covers only, and then post a link here in the comments....  >;)"
