,brekke00,2006-10-02T18:32Z,i realy am having a bad day in the writing part.
,brekke00,2006-10-02T19:22Z,"To masukia why dont you have uploads i hate people who is not serious. why did i put my mail adress in the info field if this torrent was not of good work. i think you are on of those that dont like that we are sharing files. or do you work at microsoft and just hate that there is a better solution then the ms office pack. If you just send me a mail i will answer all your questions.  the only thing you gain from writing false comments is that the torrent do not get downloaded an that there only is some people sharing it. then the download speed is going to be low, and that is not good fore any bt community. is this so hard to understand? and your bad tretts do not make me pee on my self it just make me *rolf*   i do think it only is harming the community.

just send a mail to me. brekke00@google.com or you can go to my home page and mail me from there http://brekke00.googlepages.com"
