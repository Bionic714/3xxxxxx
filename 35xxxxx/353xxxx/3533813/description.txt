P-P-P... P-P-P... P-Unit!
A satirical video about rap.

Excerpt from the creators' paper:

Essentially, ?Generic Rap Song? and its accompanying music video are satirical
attacks on the current top sellers in the rap (or ?hip-hop?) music industry. Selecting
specific artists to target was not an easy job, due to both the abundance of up-and-coming
hip-hop celebrities and, in our opinions, the blatant lack of talent in today?s ?Top 40?
(mainstream) music industry.
In writing and performing ?Generic Rap Song,? we targeted the specific
shortcomings of each featured artist, creating a synthesis of satirical attacks that, in turn,
targets the state of the industry as a whole. Moreover, our diverse body of targets
allowed us to further experiment with many different satirical techniques, including the
use of social standards, profanity, ethnic stereotypes, and current events as tools for
delivering social satire through parody.
