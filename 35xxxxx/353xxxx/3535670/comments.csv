,richel,2006-10-08T06:38Z,Thank you - have you got episode 6 please?
,duderofthenight,2006-10-08T06:40Z,I'm sure 6 would be here if he did...
,Shiftguru,2006-10-09T00:29Z,"Hmm im not sure i understand, so the one you released earlier is 7?"
,Merihim,2006-10-10T17:39Z,"A few thing I only do torrents here and only rip
in Xvid any real player MP4 etc. etc or  links
to sendspace have nothing to do with me/
People who posted these links were trying to
help. I can tell you this much files encoded
in RP or MP4 kinda suck and there usually
will have issues, pixelization blurry etc. etc.
I cannot tell people what's best to view them
nor will i upload crappy quality torrents so 
PLEASE instead of pm me for problems with 
this stuff ask the person who posted the links
or better GOOGLE it all the answers will be
found."
