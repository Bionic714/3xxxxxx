will not work on the dvd. I´ve tried, so don´t make the same mistake!!!"
,Capt.Wenge,2006-09-30T14:56Z,"Pleeas! How to make this work on a DVD!

,Capt.Wenge,2006-09-30T19:56Z,"THX

,x-z3r0,2006-10-02T22:07Z,Anyone who can get this one with swesub or tell me who to mix a dvd and a subtitle together? Cya
[V],spirit58,2006-10-04T10:15Z,"Hello Kalin1102,

thanks for the movie, but as you can see here there is something wrong. When you burn this and tries to play it in a DVD-player, it jumps back to main menu.

Is there anything we can do ?"
