Jon Arbuckle (Meyer) travels to the United Kingdom,
and he brings his cat, Garfield (voiced by Murray),
along for the trip. A case of mistaken cat identity
finds Garfield ruling over a castle, but his reign is
soon jeopardized by the nefarious Lord Dargis (Connolly),
who has designs on the estate.
