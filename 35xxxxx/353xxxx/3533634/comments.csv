Du behöver Power Iso  för att packa upp filerna... för i H-V...

You need Power Iso to unpack the files."
,bonkeman,2006-10-07T12:32Z,Why the fuck upload a daa-file???
,Baga,2006-10-09T08:29Z,I will NEVER upload a DAA file again... I dont know what I was thinking??? 
,ryan21255,2008-03-28T06:13Z,"If you have any problems with the DAA file then just download magic iso for free right here on the pirate bay. Magic Iso downloads really fast when downloaded from here. After that it only takes a few minutes to extract the files and create a new folder. Ahhhhhh all that hard work. It's amazing how stupid and lazy we all have become. I admit I'm not a computer expert, but it just took me a few minutes to do a google search to find what to do with a DAA-file and the tools I needed."
,ryan21255,2008-03-28T21:02Z,"I'm sorry Power Iso works better on DAA files, while Magic Iso is good for UIF files. Still, Power Iso is another program that can be downloaded right here on the pirate bay for free. Yea!!!! Got everything working, so now I can go back to reminiscing about the 80's. "
