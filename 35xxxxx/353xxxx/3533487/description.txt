Description: Filmed in 1952 shortly after the end of American occupation, Children of Hiroshima reflects the contemplative, often apocalyptic, testimonial cinema of the hibakusha - the survivors of the atomic bomb. By interweaving real-life accounts of actual survivors with the observations of a fictional protagonist, Kaneto Shindo creates a deeply personal, yet objective chronicle of the world's harrowing first encounter with the destructive potential of the atomic bomb on August 6, 1945: the highly formalized montage of everyday life unfolding against the sound of a ticking clock that resolutely moves ever closer towards the appointed bombing time of 8:15 AM; the haunting, reenacted shot of an anonymous victim's "vaporized" charred outline on an outdoor staircase; the flashback image of children reciting nursery rhymes in circular formation that cuts to two broken, sequentially rotated shots of the former kindergarten teachers standing on a vacant lot of the former playground. Based on a collection of thoughtful poems and stories written by the young survivors of the Hiroshima bombing (compiled by Arata Osada), Children of Hiroshima is a pensive, compelling, and provocative account of the residual effects and incalculable human toll of the atomic bomb's tragic and indelible legacy.
