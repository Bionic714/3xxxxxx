,AMcK,2008-01-26T22:32Z,"Why am I the only person seeding this excellent version of the movie with all the language and subtitle streams. Please stay online after you've dl'd so that others can enjoy.
Wikipedia says several versions of the film and video releases have been made: Petersen oversaw the editing of six hours of film, from which was distilled Das Boot: The Director's Cut, 209 minutes long (3 hours, 29 minutes), released in 1997, which combines the action sequences seen in the feature-length version with character-development scenes contained in the mini-series."

,HarryBitslinger,2010-02-22T21:28Z,"My client reports ~70 peers in this swarm out of which only 8 connect and the transfer rates are below a leaky faucet level. How about some uploading, dudes !"
,HarryBitslinger,2010-03-01T05:28Z,One word of caution - the English subs in this release are censored and sissied up. I've seen this film before and understand enough German to know that this is not the real thing. Find yourself a better subs version and don't be deprived of the full experience
