RELEASE NOTES:

Mhm, our leader presses me to hurry.
So what needs to be said about Nikola Sarcevic? Nothing i guess. If you don\'t
know him you\'re prolly into hiphop or dance floor hehe
The follow-up to Lock Sport Krock.
By the Way, in my very opinion this is so much more punk rock than like 80% of
the punk releases these days (..even there are some songs that may go straight
into the charts)
