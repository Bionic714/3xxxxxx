Finland vs. Sweden - Torino Olympics Gold Medal Final 2006


X264 codec, ffdshow and Media Player Classic (recommended) is required to view the video files, you can find all the programs here: http://x264.nl/


Look under \"encoder\" and \"decoder\" sections and you\'ll find them. 


In the torrent file you\'ll also find a decoder called CoreAVC Video Decoder, which makes the files run more smoothly on your pc. All you\'ll have to do is to follow the instructions in the CoreAVC_DSDec.rar file.
