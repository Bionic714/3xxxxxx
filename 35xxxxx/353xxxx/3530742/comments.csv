I've done search at piratnova and there's nothing under law of desire.Funny.I know there's no other version than this one ever printed and there's only UK version existing.You must have some hidden agenda."
,uncleroy77,2006-09-28T12:28Z,"Thanks a million, rudolfo2. I have been following your uploads for the last several weeks and am particularly grateful for the fact you always include english subs in your uploads. Looking forward to your upcoming releases and, as usual, will seed, seed, seed."

Here's Interent Movie Database for this one: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093412/"

,texassy,2008-10-07T13:13Z,What Region is this? Or has it been stripped out? Any playback on NTSC aka US?
,joeyjammer69,2009-06-18T01:26Z,"The file size is DVD% but DVD9 is listed in description also HCEncoder is also mentioned.

Was the upload shrunk down from a DVD9? 
Was any encoding performed?
Is this the complete DVD or was anything removed?

Can the subtitles be turned off or are they hardcoded?

Thank you for the upload.
