Part one of a month long look at \"OLD PEOPLE WHO ROCK\".

This week I\'ll be doing an album spotlight on Dead Moon\'s 1994 album \"Crack In The System\".
Dead moon is a Garage band from Portland made up of singer/guitarist/songwriter Fred Cole. His wife Toody plays bass and Andrew Loomis plays drums. They formed in 87 but Fred and Toody have been playing together since the late 70\'s, and Fred himself was playing as far back as 1965, with the Garage Rock band, The Weeds.
Dead Moon has become his longest standing band, and are still putting records out to this day.
Recently they\'ve found cult status in the american hardcore scene. This past summer they were asked to play at the \"Chaos In Tejas\" fest with bands like Tragedy, Limp Wrist, and The Dicks.
I\'ve only become aware of them since then, through people I know who saw them at that show, and they have quickly become a mini obsession of mine.
Tune in tonight to hear why.
