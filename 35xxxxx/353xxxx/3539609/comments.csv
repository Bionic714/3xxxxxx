,Dezsike,2006-10-15T16:53Z,"Thank you!
Its bad to know that only 3 disks left, but good to know that all of them are (will be) torrented."
,strider2004,2006-10-15T19:02Z,"Only 3 left!!  I doubt it!  You have mis- understood me, there will be loads to come, I have subscribed to the magazine and get them delivered to my door every 2 weeks straight from the distributer plus I buy another set and post it to friends in Hong Kong, so we will not miss any!!! 
But 'YES' they will ALL be torrented!

KEEP SEEDING!"
,Dezsike,2006-10-15T20:59Z,"Oh, there will be more? The last spot is '32' on the rewards screen so i guessed thats the last, sorry. I keep seeding them, i cant always online but i continue seeding as long as possible. Anybody need any of the previous ones just tell me i have them all so i can seed them anytime"
,strider2004,2006-11-01T14:08Z,"1st November,2006.   

I am seeding all 31 games again for a wee while - at least till we get some seeders.   

Please try to seed for a bit and keep these going.

Anyone stuck, P.M. me and I WILL seed."

,coolguy1976,2012-02-22T16:41Z,"Pls seed at least 1:1 to keep torrents alive.
