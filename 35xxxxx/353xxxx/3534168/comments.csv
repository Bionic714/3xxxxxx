:-)"
,speakeasy,2006-10-05T19:10Z,BTW is this based on the 350Mb or the 700Mb  AVI releases?
,speakeasy,2006-10-05T19:11Z,p.s. *Great* to see you back!
[T],deathmule,2006-10-05T19:38Z,"700Mb AVI converted into 16:9 NTSC DVD, great Quality :)"
,speakeasy,2006-10-05T19:50Z,Brilliant - that's the answer I wanted :-))
,awasegg,2006-10-06T13:50Z,"Very nice quality! =)

But I'm confused, is it just the half first episode of season 3? The first file was really long and gave a really good overlock of what have happend on Lost the first 2 seasons.. But the other file, 1st episode of season 3 was only like 25 minutes long? "
,awasegg,2006-10-06T16:26Z,"Sorry! Noticed that the other half was in the first file ;) 

And thank you SO MUCH!"

Is this Lost.E3S1 or is it the hole seaason 3? 

I think it's to big, for just beeing Epesode 1 

lost season 3 just started. if you read the info box, i said there are 2 Episodes on this DVD. first Episode is a recap on season 1/2 and the second Episode is the first Episode of season 3. each Episode is 755MB so its not to big. these are also HD Episodes (high MB)"

first you need to download bitlord or bitcomet and install it, then click ""download this torrent"" and it should open up in bitlord/bitcomet. if it doesnt open, right click on ""download this torrent"" and save the torrent file to a file and open the torrent file with bitlord/bitcomet and your done :)"

,spacedust,2006-10-09T15:42Z,"Hi deathmule

Many thanks for another great Lost upload.  Season 2 has just finished here in the UK so this is much appreciated.  Keep up the good work and look forward to downloading each weekly episode of Lost."
,geneva1206,2006-10-09T18:02Z,Thank you thank you thank you.  will you be posting all the episodes?
,spacedust,2006-10-09T18:37Z,"Hi Deathmule
Will you be doing a separate/individual torrent for each new episode or compiling episodes into blocks.  Personally I like the idea of individual torrents for each new episode/two episodes and possibly a compile every six episodes or so.  Food for thought and as you're the one doing the work obviously your call."
,morloc,2006-10-09T21:56Z,I hope the next episode is just around the corner. :D

when you install InterVideo WinDVD 7 or a program like InterVideo WinDVD 7. all you have to do is click on the VIDEO_TS file (not the folder) and it will open so you can watch it on your PC. heres what the files should look like
