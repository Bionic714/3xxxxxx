Maximus-Garyopa_XTRM-HITACHI_v2_2_Stealth 8in1
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
*** MOST OF THE WORK IS FROM garyOPA, even most of this Readme File ***
*** TESTED MANY TIMES ON 46/47/59/59B, other versions not tested ***


FEATURES (my contribution on this release):

* Removed old media detection and replaced with better media detection
(media detection ver 2) from Geremia.
* Incorporates Maximus Firmware Stealth (Full Firmware Stealth)
* Added support for 59b firmware (what a stupid fw)
* Not yet Media Stealth... I have not heard news on this topic


Three Commands (for flashing use only one: Flash15s or Flash22s, no both):

FLASH22S.BAT: Flashes your drive with 2.2 Fw Stealth (Media Detect 2,
F900 core and Firwmare Stealth

FLASH15S.BAT: Flashes your drive with 1.5 Fw Stealth (Media Detect 2,
and Firwmare Stealth, (NO F900 Core)

RESTORE.BAT: Return your drive to original State, even if you have
firmware stealth in your drive


*RECOMENDATION: If you have flashed your drive in the past use RESTORE
first. If it is a brand new drive use directly the Flash command you
like. If you dont plan to use your drive to dump games use the
flash15s.bat


* ALL NEW XTREME V2.2 FIRMWARE FOR ALL BUILDS OF THE HITACHI DRIVES!

- Now includes "Security Sector Extraction" for all Hitachi Drives

- Included media detection 2 from Geremia and Maximus Firmware
Stealth, this release just supports SS Extraction within Windows
without the need to re-flash your drive back and forth between
PLAY & RIP!



Flashing your drive
-------------------
FLASH22S.BAT automatically makes a complete backup of your firmware system

* To FLASH a drive, it must be in "Mode B" and have "Drive Letter"
* Then just run FLASH21 from "Command Prompt" while inside windows
* Prompt must be at the same directory with the rest of the files!

* FLASH22S needs two variables, the assigned "Drive Letter", and any 4
numbers for the BACKUP directory, use a new unique number like 1572

- This is used to make your BACKUP directory!

- For Example: FLASH22S.BAT H 1572

- Will cause the FLASH after running to have, a BACKUP directory
"X22-1572" and the program will store FIVE firmware files:

---- key.bin ---- DRIVE KEY /// DRIVE KEY
---- was.bin ---- Your drive before FLASH
---- gdrXX.bin ---- The untouch original fw
---- XX_22.bin ---- The patched Xtreme22 fw
---- now.bin ---- Your drive after FLASH!

- Where the XX in the above names will be the version of your Hitachi

* Program will not start unless a BACKUP is correctly made and stored!

* Flash will auto-detect your firmware build of your Hitachi drive.

* You can flash any drive, even "v1.1" or "f900" or your own hacks.

* System will check flashed firmware, and redo until 100% completed.

* Once you get the PASS / DONE line, you can shut-down the system.


FLASH15S.BAT is the same as above but, without F900 core, use this
if you dont want to extract SS with your drive.



Restoring your drive
--------------------
RESTORE.BAT automatically restores your drive back to original state

* To RESTORE a drive, it must be in "Mode B" and have "Drive Letter"
* Then just run RESTORE from "Command Prompt" while running windows.

* The new RESTORE does not need any backup, it will 100% restore your
drive back to "ORIGINAL" state as long as it is visible in Windows!

* Program will not start unless it detects the version of your Hitachi!

* You can restore any drive, even "v1.1" or "f900" or your own hacks.

* System will check flashed firmware, and redo until 100% completed.

* Once you get the PASS / DONE line, you can shut-down the system.
