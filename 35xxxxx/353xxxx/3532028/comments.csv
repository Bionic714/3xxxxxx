,skatekillen_93,2007-03-13T16:23Z,does it work on playstation 2?
,eye690,2008-01-21T20:26Z,"This does not work in my Elite with Xtreme 1.4. I've tested the ISO with XDVDMulleter and it lacks a video file and DMI among other things, making it incompatible with recent hacked Xbox360's."
,eye690,2008-01-21T20:28Z,"This is actually Amped_3_PAL_PROPER_XBOX360-RoME. The reason for the proper is that it's supposed to work with recent firmwares, but it's not iXtreme compatible according to XDVDMulleter."

,Entropy_X,2008-10-24T14:53Z,"Although typically mistaken for a noob question, I'm not exactly sure how to unpack this. I see the working .dvd file, but I'm not seeing an .iso file anywhere.

I've done this plenty of times before, but this is a first. There some forgotten files here, or am I just more ignorant than I thought?"
