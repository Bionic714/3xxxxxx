,badjesus,2010-02-27T10:40Z,"Fantastic application!!!

Downloaded in about 2 minutes, worked right away with the serial provided, and is one of the easiest applications I have ever used! Soooo simple! I have Used it to join two very high quality videos together, and it was fast, and absolutely none of the original quality was lost (which so many other video joiners suffer from).

Incredible app, and thanks so very much for the great upload!"
