immediately listenable, worth a download. thanks for sharing, you cant buy latin music in my country. esta bien el disco, creo que vale la pena bajarlo. gracias por compartir, no se puede comprar musica latina en mi pais. please seed to at least 1:1 guys or you can't get these in some months time

it gets better the more you listen to it, highly recommended. el disco es mejor y mejor cada vez que lo eschucho, recomendado. now the hunt to try and buy it..."
