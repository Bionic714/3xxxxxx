VERY RARE VIDEO. 
I have never found it for a download. I had a VHS recording, I copied it onto a DVD using an LG RC7000B equipment, and then, converted it into a DivX. SUBTITLES ARE IN BR-PORTUGUESE.

PLEASE, continue seeding after downloading. My upload bandwidth is VERY limited.
I hope you will have fun!!!!  ;)
