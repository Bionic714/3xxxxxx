Bulgarian Women's Choir - Le Myst?re Des Voix Bulgares - Volume 1 (192kbps) 1975

This album contains some of most unique music I have ever heard. Equal parts dissonant harmony, soaring melody, this album manages to be both deeply melancholy and incredibly joyous at the same time. The overall affect is both haunting and uplifting. Please seed!!
