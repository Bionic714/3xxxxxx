New Young Pony Club - All Releases Compilation

I heard this Intel Core2 Duo commercial (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZtCsxknt5k), and the music sounded interesting.  I had never heard of New Young Pony Club, but seemd like a good tune in the commercial.

This torrent contains every mp3 I could find by the group.  I even ripped a couple streams to wav and re-encoded them myself since nobody had an mp3 available for download.  Bitrate varies quite a bit, and there\'s probably alot more of their music available.  I listened to all tracks and made sure they sounded acceptable for portable.  Not sure how they\'ll sound on the big system off a cd.  I just though I\'d save you guys the trouble of finding all these yourself.  It took me about an hour.  Don\'t bother with the feedback if you think they sound like shit.  Keep in mind these were the best I could find when putting together this compilation.
