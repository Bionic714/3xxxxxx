The War Game is a fictional, worst-case-scenario docu-drama about
nuclear war and its aftermath in and around a typical English city.
Although it won an Oscar for Best Documentary, it is fiction. It was
intended as an hour-long program to air on BBC 1, but it was deemed
too intense and violent to broadcast. It went to theatrical
distribution as a feature film instead. Low-budget and shot on 
location, it strives for and achieves convincing and unflinching
realism.

Part interviews and quotations, part acting, this film simulates
the aftermath of a large-scale nuclear attack near a rural area of
England. It argues that citizens and Civil Defense authorities are
poorly prepared for this eventuality, and describes possible
physical, psychological and social damage in graphic detail.

Despite having been produced by the British Broadcasting Corporation
(BBC), the film was banned from television broadcast. The official
reason was for violence and depiction of human suffering, but others
hinted that it may have been because it went against the official
government line concerning survivability of nuclear attack. While the
ban forbade television broadcast, it did not forbid cinematic
distribution. Because of this loophole, the film was given wide
release in theatres, and won four major film awards.
