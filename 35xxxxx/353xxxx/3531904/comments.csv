Qoute: ""MESSAGE FROM T3CH___________________________________________________________
   This is the nonstandard 'FAT' build. 
   I have updated 'Apple Movie Trailers' to version 0.91. 
   This build is based on XBMC 2.0.0 sourcetree as found on Sourceforge.
   Other news is the added new 3D visualiser created by MrC. Great work!
   Also, Team XBMC snuck in support for USB FAT devices, read more about it here: 
 o http://www.xboxmediacenter.com/wiki/index.php?title=USB_Mass_Storage_support_in_XBMC .
   I will release a slightly bigger build soon, so if you want extras, wait for that!"""

,Joshatdot,2006-10-04T07:54Z,"There is a new build of XBMC out, 2006-10-03, it looks like the new builds from T3CH/CVS are the SLIM releases.

I have tried to upload the new build, but TPB is having issues with new uploads, something about Error 5 and failed SQL move file..."
,Tcip,2006-10-04T11:18Z,Joshatdot - how can i restore what xbmc did to my xbox?!
,Tcip,2006-10-04T18:51Z,I needed to burn out the Console Disc 3. To a DVD to make it to work. Evry thing works no (but i dosen't dl any more xbmc 2.0 ..)
,squirl14,2006-10-06T21:06Z,For the most part it is a good version.  Just don't unzip the trainers in the Trainer folder on C drive.  It will make your xbox reboot over and over.  To fix you can start xbox by using the open cd drive button and ftping in the xbox.  From there you can go to C: drive and rename the trainer folder to trainer1.  You could also delete all the files in the folder but the renaming  is faster.
,Tcip,2006-10-07T07:11Z,"squirl14 - I needed to: Burnout Console Disc 3.0 on a DVD-R. And format the harddrive . And install EvoX & xbmc (the ""old"" one).. So don't use this shit yet. Or use, gasdrives"
