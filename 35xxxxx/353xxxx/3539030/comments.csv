,charlie_echo,2006-10-14T20:44Z,"wow!!!!! thanks guys, downloading now and will seed afterwards!"
,rrodger99,2006-10-15T03:41Z,"Time for a little Saab 340 trivia.

This was 1 of the few airplanes that came equippes with a kick stand. There is an aluminum pole stowed under the cargo bin that must be attached to the rear of the aircraft.

It seems the aircraft is tail heavy & if you deplaned the pax or tried to load the plane prior to boarding, it would tip back onto it's tail...in theory this pole was to stop that...all that usually happened was the pole would bend or push up through the floor.

Also the cargo bin is higher than the crj's & erj's."
,PapaHotel,2006-10-15T08:53Z,Damn this bird is a beauty! Thanx 4X-AXG =)
,whityini,2006-10-15T13:32Z,"Sorry I can't find installation instructions.
Where really are?
Thanks"
,niklasnordin,2006-10-15T14:59Z,"I have done exactly as requestet with installation, but registration fails and i've got no gauges
Tanx anyway for a lovely aircraft"
,darkyz,2006-10-16T11:37Z,"actually that kickstand wasn't supposed to hold the aircraft, it's just for the ground crew to know when to stop loading because of the tailstrike risk. It has a quick release when the tail gets too low (at least the 340B does, not sure about the A, only flew B).
The operation manual states that in that moment we must load the passengers before attempting to fill the cargo.

Also when powering back we're forbidden to stop with brakes, tailstrike WILL occur."
,darkyz,2006-10-16T11:40Z,"niklasnordin: install the basic pack, then update 1.1 and after that open the load configuration utility, go to the gauges setup and insert this data:

Registered Name: Michael Maidenberg 

Registered Email: jhadwig@desdeinter.net 

Product Registration Code: 5D1EE384B064B67B65B77DE307841033B0E02ABB21B9D06511

and that's it, should work without problems."
,niklasnordin,2006-10-16T22:40Z,That is exactly what i did. And registration failed.Sorry to say.
,niklasnordin,2006-10-16T23:07Z,"OK, I disconnected from internet and this time all went ok. She flies like a swan and this time with gauges. Thanx 4X-AXG"
,sgnauz,2006-10-17T09:29Z,I found this plane pretty but unfortunately I must state that the panel is somewhat peasant. I decided to mount the PSS Dash8 panel with better graphics and functions. If someone is interested on the Dashy I will upload it.
