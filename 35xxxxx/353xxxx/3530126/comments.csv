,SoundWall,2006-09-27T20:25Z,"You got 100Mbit at school?!?!

Of all the schools and courses I've went to, I believe the top speed has been 1Mbit. Although I got 100Mbit at home, so I don't give a shit.


Anyways, you don't happen to have any Swedish or English subs for this movie or know where one could get any? Thanks."
,SoundWall,2006-09-29T14:26Z,"I'm not usually one to shout ""seed"" at people who upload torrents, but this time I feel I have to since it hasn't been seeded at all since it was uploaded two days ago.

SEED GODDAMNIT!!

Or remove the torrent if you're not going to."
