,etho,2007-12-03T04:11Z,"I would argue that the book beats the television version. But I did enjoy the TV version.

This one... eh. It's not a very good version of Dune, but it's worth watching."
,Sachaztan,2007-12-11T21:09Z,"Well it's old so it's no big wonder that it looks a bit bad, but it didn't get nominated for those oscars and other awards without reason, not to mention it won one..."
