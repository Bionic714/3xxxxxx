Yeah yeah, sure. I can google it. But hey, anybody ever think about that not everyone has a 1,2,3,4 or better connection. Some of us actually still have old connections!! CALLED MODEMS!! Like in 34kbs. NOT MBS!!
Well whatever. Now people are just gonna pick at me for complaining instead of thanking. Sure, i would have thanked if the uploader would have finished his job. So piss of and complain all you want. Im never comming back to this torrent anyway so i wont be reading your BS!!!"
