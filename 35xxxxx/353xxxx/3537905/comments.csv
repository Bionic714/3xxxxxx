,encoded evil,2006-10-12T10:53Z,"how long does it take from the end of the episode till it's up here? can some1 tell me that?

And I always take the download where there are many seeders? Is that good?

Thanx for upload! respect"
,encoded evil,2006-10-12T10:54Z,does a NO LIMIT upload speed desadvantages my NO LIMIT download speed?

The time between airing and upload is usually pretty short, it depends on the show though, i would say to give them a couple of hours between.

More seeders means more people have downloaded the file completely and are sharing it with everyone, hence more options for where to get the file from, i.e yes, more seeders = good.

You should set you upload speed to be about 80% of the download speed, the reason why is that every packet will be confirmed when its sent, higher upload speed means that you are sending a load of these confirmation packets leaving less bandwidth for the actual transfer.

Oh yea, thanks for the show too, being waiting all week for this!"
,encoded evil,2006-10-12T11:27Z,"thnx for the info -pete-

""You should set you upload speed to be about 80% of the download speed""

hmm but I work with bitlord so I have to adapt it manually everytime my dl-speed changes? Anyway I do have the impression that my dl speed reduces with upload maxed out

so they do it like this:

capture the episode with a TV-tuner card, convert the episode to divx/xvid (30 min ??)
upload to torrent site (2 hours ??)

correct?

this interests me

How do i view the files on my computer?

after install, windows media player and any other player will be able to view these videos"
,_-WoK-_,2006-10-12T17:36Z,"XOR's releases are usually worse than LOL's. For example, XOR releases have sometimes claimed to be PDTVrips, but instead they are DSR. LOL also uses a little bit higher resolution."
,conjunction,2006-10-12T18:04Z,Were is the avi file?
,Alestrix,2006-10-12T20:02Z,"x-post from http://thepiratebay.org/details.php?id=3537900:

kdsde,

The reasons explained on that website are, imo, mostly bullshit. Having a load of rar files will no more or less ensure that this is an original release then if one shares one large AVI.

Splitting a release into many files of equal size may make a lot of sense when distributing them via newsgroups, but for bittorrent I do not see any advantage. On the contrary: for watching the AVI one has to extract the file, requireing twice the space on the HDD, which will lead many people to deleting the RARs and only keeping the AVI, resulting in fewer seeds.

Furthermore, the sfv file is not necessary for bittorent since it uses its one checksum.

And if one wants to have a sample with the ""full featured AVI"" (which is another argument brought forward on that site), then this can be added to the main AVI file just as it is added to the rar files. Thus, the sample is no reason to use RAR either.

So again, on bittorent, using RARs just makes no sense!"
,oleghh,2006-10-14T22:19Z,"Alestrix:

Stop your fucking flaming. We who appreciate rar has chosen this torrent because this is how we want our releases. There is an other torrent for you dumb fucks who obviously don't plan to share your files, keep it uncorrupted or just don't care.

You know there are other methods than BT out there when it comes to sharing files with your 'buddies'.."
