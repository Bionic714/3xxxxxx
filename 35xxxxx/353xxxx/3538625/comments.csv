Great stuff, thanks!"
,DonkeyHotay,2006-10-14T09:23Z,"More please! if you have any other Gilbert & Sullivan, they will be much appreciated and treasured :-)"
[T],naxosking,2006-10-14T19:50Z,I'll try. I think I got Mikado and Pinafore here somewhere. Just have to sort through all this music. I'll let you know when I upload it.
,magnum23,2006-11-23T03:09Z,I can't seem to be able to get the files onto my iPod through iTunes. Is there some kind of copy protection or is my computer just being a b*tch again?
[T],naxosking,2006-11-29T02:32Z,must be something with itunes. they're not copy protected mp3s. try just putting them straight on the to ipod by drag and drop using my computer.
,stamm5,2006-12-05T01:01Z,"Doesnt want to open any of the tracks in media player or nero says incorrect format. Any ideas would be appreciated.

Thanks"
,Angel_PC187,2008-05-08T14:14Z,"I'm having the same problem, when I try to move the track into iTunes I get this error message......""Gilbert & Sullivan - Pirates of Penzance [CD2] was not copied to the iTunes because it cannot be played on iTunes"" and when I try in Windows Media Player I get this error message....""The file you are attempting to play has an extension that does not match the file format. Playing the file may result in unexpected behavior. Do you want the player to try to play the file?"" but when I hit yes it plays now I just have to figure out how to make it work in iTunes so I can get it on my iPod. Any help?"
,rbsfou,2008-05-15T04:35Z,"I also had iTunes problems. I solved them by running the files through mp3val (http://mp3val.sourceforge.net/) doing scan and then repair, then i was able to put them in iTunes just fine.

Wish people would actually CHECK that their rips were not corrupt before uploading though :("

,paulbx,2011-01-02T15:23Z,"The mp3val suggestion to fix the files is still correct. But make a copy first (since mp3val renames all originals to "".bak"") so that the originals are still untouched for seeding."
