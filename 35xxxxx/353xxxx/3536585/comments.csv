,dirkie1990,2006-10-23T11:52Z,The file is currupt rickoso so why dont you tell us how you got it worked?
,HabbyHebbo,2006-10-23T13:47Z,"WinRAR gives CRC error from the last file: ld-coh.r76

SFV check says they are all ok.

==> this DOES NOT WORK!!!!
ANY WORKING VERSION AVAILABLE??"
,Jonbeee,2006-10-23T23:51Z,"Hey Rickoso.

Instead of declaring everyone as an idiot, explain how to install the game... 

You know, us ""noobs"" dont know everything."
,uggurhuggu,2006-10-24T14:52Z,how can i do with the file that is corrupt?? (81)
,at080171,2006-10-25T09:13Z,"DO NOT TOUCH THIS TORRENT! it doesn't work, part of the rar file structure is corrupt. I have used powerarchiver, winrar, 7zip, all fail. 
And no, I am not a newbie, I do in fact know what I'm doing with this stuff and can confidently say that this file is broken.
If anyone begs to differ, then please do it usefully - tell us what software you are using to unrar the files successfully."
,riotmind,2006-10-25T16:13Z,"I'm having no trouble unraring it (I use winrar), the trouble is that the game wont start once it is installed :/"
,rubben321,2006-10-25T19:47Z,"The same happens to me. So something is missing in the rar archive.

So don't..."
,yong1986,2006-10-26T05:51Z,"To riotmind:
what version of winrar are you using?"
,riotmind,2006-10-26T13:07Z,"Sry guys i was fucking with ya, I use Ultimate Zip 3.0.3, it works though the game won't start"
,yong1986,2006-10-27T08:22Z,"I tried to extract the file using Ultimate Zip 3.0.3, but it still failed to extract, this is what I get:
Extracting to: ""E:\Downloads\Company_of_Heroes-PCGAME-LOADiNG\""
Use Path: yes
Overwrite files: no

Error: ld-coh.iso     Bad block
Extracting: ld-coh.iso
Warning: ld-coh.iso failed the CRC Check"
,sft008,2006-10-28T02:25Z,"ld-coh.part81.rar fails CRC. Those saying they got it to work, wonderful. How in the world can you explain a rar of rars passes crc and then fails on 1 file? It probably came corrupted, and has nothing to do with you interrupting the download etc.... SO DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME."
,volvovolvo,2006-11-05T22:16Z,"I've downloaded and unpacked it with no problem at all. The 78 files (ld-coh.rar, ld-coh.r00-ld-coh.r76) unpack just fine into a file named DISK1.ISO. I'm using WinRAR 3.51, btw. The download also contains the file ld-coh.nfo, with instructions, serial etc. A good as a download can be, imho.

Keep your fingers crossed: I'll try to install next ;)."
,volvovolvo,2006-11-06T00:21Z,"Installed flawlessly (using 453a-b648-25a9-caa7-79e5) and seems to work. Seeing the trouble you guys seem to have, I start to wonder if I really comment on the right torrent... :/"
,sudniok,2006-11-09T02:40Z,The rar file #81 is corrupted. I checked it and tried to work around it but I had no luck. I have checked other torrents that may possibly have that 81 file but there was no luck. I'm guessing this torrent and rar files will remain damage until the original creator can fix the file. And for Rickoso; surprised you called everyone here a noob and yet I think that you probably had the same problem but didn't want to express it out here in this topic. And also the only noob here is you as only a noob would cry and complain about other people needing help. 
,WOTSZAPPLE,2006-11-09T04:12Z,"guys, would appreciate a shout if ya manage to get file 81 uploaded....damaged for me also!

and for those who claims it works, lmfao.
comment on the right forums plz....lol"
,chruttland,2006-11-09T23:55Z,"damn it, doesnt work for me either.. to bad. I´ll wait for another release. dont blame the ppl who uploaded though."
,Uzielen,2006-11-16T18:34Z,Yup... file 81 is corrupt... crc failure
,alexandersson,2006-11-21T23:48Z,have u tried mounting the file? haven´t downloaded it myself yet. but sometimes the iso file looks just the same as a rar-archive. mount it or burn the image to disc.
,Mickee85,2006-11-23T18:04Z,Works fine for me!
,Chiva$,2007-01-20T22:36Z,"People please stop telling that this works fine...Probably you're commenting on the wrong torrent,still i would really appreciate if we could get another part 81,and yes this is the only realease with 81 parts so be sure it's the one you did dl before posting here that it works..."
,Grom619,2007-10-27T18:41Z,Worked great for me. Just mounted it onto daemon with no problems.
,Fattig-,2007-12-14T21:39Z,i seeder SEED
,Santanao,2008-07-07T16:52Z,"For those that appears a message that Disk1.iso is a broken file, try to check the CRC with sfvcheck, and then, if everything is allright start extracting from ld-coh.rar, not from ld-coh.r00. Thanks for your patience, i hope that this will be useful for you."
