,Clapton,2006-10-03T20:29Z,Well I don't like to think in terms of who is better...but Ronnie enjoys so much while playing and transmit joy and magic to everybody watching him...only that worth a ticket entrance to see him playing...and F.C Barcelona is on top thanks to him. Let's hope he won't get injured like Eto'o...the soccer today shamely seems to be against players like Ronaldinho... Thanks KallAnka!
