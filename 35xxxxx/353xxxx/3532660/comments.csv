,lassekillen,2006-10-03T18:44Z,Several of the files are corrupt and will only partially play. Does anyone else have this problem?
,VoB Guy,2006-10-04T01:40Z,"They are not corrupt, read what I said in the info

""Make sure your favourite DVD player can play edited vob files, otherwise there can be stops in the middle of clips that are cut together""

PowerDVD 6 plays them all fine"

,Baloo2,2007-12-13T14:40Z,"Not a comment for a year on this great collection?

And most of the comments are totally off topic as well as nooby. Jeezzz man, VoB Guy, your collection really deserves better than this. 

It's an amazing collection all of you wankers have here, and yet you just download it, don't know what to do with it, and then run like the chicken shit pathetic low-lives you are.

VobGuy: I salute you! This is an awesome collection that obviously must have taken a lot of effort to create, and yet the usual hit&runners of the Pirate Bay are whining.

,Baloo2,2007-12-13T15:39Z,"And yes, I can confirm that all the completed files I have so far works perfectly well with my PowerDVD 6.5.

If you are so stupid you don't even try to search TPB for that player you really should not even be entitled to watch any of the clips with mplayer (that works fairly well but can't handle multi-scenes properly)."
,Baloo2,2007-12-16T07:13Z,"I've finally managed to complete the download. Thanks to you two guys (one Swede and one Brazil) that served me all the time. I will of course keep seeding for at least a couple of months (don't you all?).

I've looked at all the files and can confirm (once again) that they all work perfectly well with my PowerDVD 6.5.

About half a dozen of the clips are not nude but sexy at most. Some are really too short -- just a few pics. But most of them are bound to be classic flicks. 

Maybe they could have been bundled together so that every celeb only got one file, but that's just a humble opinion.

All in all, one of the best nude celeb collection I've ever downloaded! Highly recommended! I give it five stars out of five."
