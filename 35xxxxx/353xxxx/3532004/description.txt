I got so sick of the newest Nero for freezing up my system whilst burning a disk, I went looking 4 some light multisession burning software just like nero which let's me  go on doing my stuff

It's a portable, so you dont have to install
2 get rid of the timer,you have to import the 'reg' file (just double click it)
and make a shortcut of 'ScdbPrj.exe' to your desktop

you'll probably like it as much as I do
