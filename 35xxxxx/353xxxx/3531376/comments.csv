,kiwi_pearls,2008-05-12T23:15Z,"I'm really confused.  I am new to the world of torrents and downloaded smallville as I found out my tv network has being airing it late on friday nights, so I missed the first 3 episodes.  What I don't understand is, I have all these RAR files, but each RAR contains the exact duplicate file.  Could someone please explain to me why there is 40 RAR files all containing the same avi - as I wondered why this took over 3 days to download."
