The law of attraction is simple:  the more you take and the less you give, the more that shall be taken from you.  Watch out. Do not say I didn't warn you. This version is not even the complete book.  It is missing the last chapter and roughly 70 pages.  Do yourself a favor and *BUY* the complete version.  It will bless your life."

by the way the book appears complete in itself once you download and check inside....  "
,idsayblue,2008-11-02T01:09Z,"yeah, joshman, what was that?!!! i think you got the concept of the law of attraction confused with something else. "
