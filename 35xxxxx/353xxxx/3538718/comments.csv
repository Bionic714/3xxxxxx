I'm really really sorry but I don't have it anymore :(  I got it from a torrent, which is the same torrent file and just reposted here, so of the original seeders joins back in, we can get it.

The good side: AVI files play (with a tiny glitch at the missing point) ok even when incomplete so give it a try..."
[V],felch,2006-11-27T20:17Z,seems someone provided the missing chunks :D  yay!  feel free to keep seeding it's one that should last for a while i think!
,Oglomite,2006-12-27T01:52Z,"I was the one. I seeded some time in hope the torrent would come to life again, which it seem to have done! I found the same set of files on IsoHunt or Mininova and joined it all together and reseeded it here. I believe quite a number of guys got their 100% after that. Pleased to help! Keep the good work up!"
