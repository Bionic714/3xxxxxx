One hot summer night, five years ago, a couple of friends got together and penned down their thoughts into music. What they never realized was that it was the making of one of the most sought after and revered bands in India - menwhopause.

The band, which soon grew to five members, was literally forced by its bunch of dedicated supporters and believers to push the music they were producing in an abandoned warehouse out into the open.

An EP titled \'The Story Begins\' was soft-launched in 2003 under the band\'s own label \"the middle earth company\". The CD, which included three songs - Free, Sweet Despair and Fly Away, became an instant hit notching thousands of downloads over the band\'s official site and bootleggers making their money by selling pirated versions completely changing the way India looked at original contemporary music being produced in English! The songs found international airplay, including BBC London, and climbed on to top 10 ranks on international mp3 sites.

Ever since, menwhopause has been slowly but steadily setting benchmarks in India\'s music scene most importantly as being one of the first bands to have stuck to playing only original music and concentrating on the art of songwriting.

\'Home\' is menwhopause\'s debut concept album and is being released internationally by the middle earth company.
