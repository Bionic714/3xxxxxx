I have scanned with Quick Par it says they are still good.  I have tried every thing to open with winrar-ectract here-open it then tells me the file is corrupt or of a type it can not open. each R01 ect: has 14 meg of data in it but I can not extract it. Do you have any help for me on this issue, I would like to know how you would unpack each rar and into what format would you do it. Thank you. A few step by steps along the way would be nice, it would help a lot."
