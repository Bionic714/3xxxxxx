,littlesilas,2007-11-19T21:51Z,I have already downloaded the 3.42 G and I am still downloading. I am at 3.55 and it says I am only 82%done. What is going on?
,bVICIL,2008-06-18T21:05Z,"thanks for share, but nedd seed..."
,hanguk,2008-08-12T09:59Z,"This torrent doesn't deserve seeding, IMHO. The rips are ""banded"", so to watch at full screen, they have to be cropped top and bottom. Four of the episodes have corruption problems that not only crashed my media player, but also Virtual Dub Mod, a program that almost never crashes! I had to split the avi files, cut out the corrupt bits, rejoin them, and then crop the black bands at top and bottom. What a pain! Surely someone has a beter quality set they could upload...Please?"
,scoobydoo2u2,2009-01-10T04:18Z,"Firstly, thanks for uploading and seeding. But Hanguk is right. This is a pretty low quality rip. Especially for 600mb file size per episode. It is in letterboxed, non-anamorphic widescreen. Which means that there are black bars across the top and bottom whether you play it on a widescreen display or a standard TV. And the resolution is very low - 352x240 so it doesn't look good even on fairly normal sized screens eg. 22''- 24''. Maybe it's because this was ripped such a long time ago. With today's latest codecs you can get much better quality rips for the same file size. Hopefully someone will upload a newer, higher quality rip someday. Thanks and Cheers."
,safr2,2009-02-07T18:20Z,low quality! (confirmed what's written above)
,davidkayla,2009-06-15T04:17Z,I downloaded the first episode of this to assess the quality (and because I didn't believe the comments above). I then played it on my tv using my dvd player that has avi capabilities. The picture was very small with a wide black bar all around it. I tried to zoom but of course the quality was then very bad. In my downloaded episode the sound was not synchronised with the picture.

,mikedillon,2010-02-01T18:09Z,"Thanks so much to all seeders, great series!"
,r0ttiem0m,2010-09-21T04:09Z,"Hey, quit ur bitching & get in the kitchen.  I can't believe the stupid people bitching about the quality.  If you don't like it and your that picky about the quality then go buy the fucking dvd.
Thanks hvlint for these."
,greytil,2010-10-01T23:01Z,"If you use Media Player Classic you can use the Pan & Scan feature to expand the picture.

Not ideal, but since this is the only torrent in town, better than nothing."
,Trench000,2010-10-03T15:55Z,"Agree on the poor quality; only expecting broadcast quality, not DVD quality, but this one is poorer still, plus the forced banding.  Switched over to:

Spooks,_Season_1
magnet:?xt=urn:btih:RA2SL23277RA3KNMM6LKXNW42WDAUJUY

At least for me it transferred in under 24 hours, and can confirm HD 640x352 without banding encoded to ~700MB file size.

Would suggest we STOP seeding this poor-quality version and devote the bandwidth elsewhere, if not the above alternative."

I guess the host site where I found it must be verboten, since direct torrent link keeps giving me ""database error"" for the attempted comment.  Since the intention is to seed the higher quality torrent, let's try this:

http [colon] [slash] [slash] [abbreviate: International Standards Organization] hunt [dot] com [slash] lite [slash] files [slash] 93492477 [slash] spooks [space] season [space] 1

http [colon] [slash] [slash] [abbreviate: International Standards Organization] hunt [dot] com [slash] download [slash] 93492477 [slash] spooks [plus] season [plus] 1 [dot] torrent

It says PB is one of the trackers, but I've not found any link to this torrent on the site.  (Just the lower-quality Season 1 we're commenting in.)  Sorry if I've missed it and provided an off-site link instead.

,Austere,2011-05-11T17:29Z,Seed Please
,samhradh3,2011-06-19T07:31Z,"I'll confirm that the video isn't high quality and there are black bars along the top and bottom. However, I had no problem viewing any of the episodes and sound was synced perfectly. For watching on your computer screen, the quality is servicable, and I enjoyed watching the show."
,bryentheartist,2012-02-16T23:58Z,thnx
