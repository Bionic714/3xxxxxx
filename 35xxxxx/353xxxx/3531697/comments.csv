,mrdunworthy,2006-09-30T19:59Z,Beats me. Some kind of crunch-bar?
,Trasher1983,2006-09-30T21:33Z,its a pack of smokes =)
,mrdunworthy,2006-09-30T21:56Z,"Oh. Well -- all good things comes threefold; M&M, S&M and now L&M."
,makstake,2006-10-05T02:33Z,"I can only wonder why people have downloaded this... I was just testing how creating and uploading a torrent works. Oh, and I forgot to mention in the description, that it is a photo taken with a Sony Ericsson K800i camera phone."
,mrdunworthy,2006-10-05T04:10Z,"I think people were just curiuos as to what an L&M really was. You *did* state clearly that it was a test, but since the file was quite small, one was willing to give in for the curiosity -- at least I was. And I think, perhaps, that you got more downloads than those guys *asking* for people to download their torrent -- partaking in some kind of university-contest... heey -- you're not *in* that contest, are you ;-)"
