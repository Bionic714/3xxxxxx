,NirreFirre,2006-10-24T12:13Z,"Aah, nice one. But a few of bootlegs regarded as his best are missing AFAIK, ""Cold Beer on a Hot Night"" (Sydney -79) and ""At the Circus"" (Sthlm -99) are both AA+ in performance, sound quality and crowd. PM me if you want them up here, otherwise they're at dimeadozen.org"
