Took me awhile to put this altogether but here it is. All the studio recordings of Waits plus some awesome bootlegs. I put them in folders so according your your client you should be able to download particular albums individually.

Definitely check out the unreleased tracks from Tales from the Underground if you don't have it. Includes some of my favorite stuff by Waits. Listen to Helium(reprise) on disc 5. Amazing bass line. 

Enjoy and please seed whatever you download ;)
