,Mattias1977,2006-10-08T10:21Z,Thanx. I'll bet it's the best you can find because there will never be a real DVD release of this. Did you make it yourself? Menu?
,jeff mills,2006-10-09T18:13Z,"Hi Harlo

Just watched it. Hilarious:) Just one question for you,or anyone else who has downloaded it: How do I burn this? The .Cue file wants to burn it as a cdrom... What am I doing wrong?

Thx 4 a great upload"
,Kome_iiv,2006-10-19T00:56Z,"im in the process of downloading. ill post a review when i got the it.

To burn these files, you burn JUST the .cue file onto a disc, and it pulls all the important stuff in with it. I use Nero Rom. heres a good walk through

,vintsukka,2006-10-22T16:11Z,I'm struggling with the same thing as Jeff. Nero is asking for a CD-R/RW istead of a DVD. What to do?
[V],roaldhan,2006-10-25T14:50Z,Has anybody managed to burn this on a DVD?
,fdiv_bug,2006-12-05T03:30Z,"I was able to burn it by mounting the *.bin* file directly with Daemon Tools and then doing a disc-to-disc copy with Alcohol 120%.  I suspect the problem is the .cue file cutting the disc short or something, since when I tried to burn it from the .cue it wouldn't let me.  Try burning the .bin directly, or use Daemon Tools like I did."
,oblachubs,2007-03-09T04:14Z,Can someone please seed this?  If you upload a new one please post here so we know. I have a copy of this but it's very bad quality so hopefully this one is better.  Thank you.
,tvjohan,2007-03-25T14:12Z,"yes, please seed. this is a treasure chest! i'll seed for a week."
,Slowda,2007-08-29T02:00Z,"SEED SEED SEED
PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE"
,sushiplatter,2007-11-09T23:21Z,Please Seed.  I'm stuck
,_404,2007-12-07T21:33Z,"I had better luck with mounting the bin/cue with Daemon tools, navigating to the folder VIDEO_TS, and copying the contents over to my hard drive. Then I used Nero to create a new DVD compilation and copied the VIDEO_TS contents to the compilation.

For some reason trying to mount the archive and then using a straight copy dvd using either Nero or Alcohol would result in an incomplete copy."
,jornin,2007-12-08T05:53Z,"OK, I found a completely bassackward way to get this onto a DVD.

In Daemon Tools make a virtual drive and use the swhs.bin file to mount the disc.  
Open the virtual drive you have created and you should see the AUDIO_TS and VIDEO_TS folders, open the VIDEO_TS folder.
Copy the contents of the VIDEO_TS folder to a new folder, I just made one my desktop.

Then follow the instructions here for burning using Nero Rom
http://www.afterdawn.com/guides/archive/burning_dvd_with_nero.cfm
but use the the files that you copy to your new folder, if you try to use the virtual hard drive folders you created Nero Rom wants to burn a cd-rom.  Using the copied files lets you fool Nero Rom and make this into a DVD.

Thanks to Harlo37 for the up, and thanks to Kome_iiv and fdiv bug for helping me figure this out.

And I just realized that 404 beat me to the punch in posting instructions for this ;(  I suck"
,Kome_iiv,2008-01-25T02:57Z,Best version so far i have seen. ^_^
,MarilynMansonsZ28,2008-07-28T22:41Z,"lol, i like how beatrice arthur plays in it,,, pretty cool thanx"
,murmelwurmel,2008-12-20T09:04Z,"big THAN YOU to the uploader!!! this is a great unexpected Christmas present :)

found a pretty easy way to burn this, just drag the .cue file onto the imgburn desk top icon (or open imgburn and then open the .cue file) and you are ready to burn, no problem with detecting the wrong disc format."
,DanishOrgan,2009-06-13T01:18Z,"Important.... Use imgburn

,niggerplz,2011-11-19T03:59Z,"There seem to be two versions on here, rifftrax and the 3.4gb one thats includes some extras. rifftrax has a sharper and more contrasted image, and includes all the commercials that aired in between segments. The 3.4gb version doesnt have any of the original commercials, though it features a short ad for the empire strikes back at the end, and it has the muppet star wars special and 30 minutes of star wars toy commercials.  They both seem to be fine editions depending on what you like. "
