The fantastic Eddi Reader released "Simple Soul" in 2001. A beautiful return to her folkier roots, more in the vein of the lush "Angels & Electricity". Beautifully produced by Boo Hewerdine & Eddi Reader, the album also features long time Eddi drummer Roy Dodds and Teddy Borowiecki (Jane Siberry, kd lang).
This is the Japanese release with 2 bonus tracks. I believe "Good Girl" was a theme song to a UK TV show?
