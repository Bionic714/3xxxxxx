,Hioushi,2006-12-08T14:35Z,"Can you please post your selec.def file to see if there is any character I might be interested in?

Thanks in advance."
,thimiesama,2007-02-15T21:24Z,BEST GAMEHACK.......EVER!!! :P
,Chaos_Seer,2007-03-12T19:54Z,"Really good, but it's frustrating. There are over 200 characters, and not enough room on the screen to show them all. How do I get half of these characters that don't fit on the screen?"
,imperial_bahamut,2007-04-03T22:55Z,"yea i have the same prob as chaos...i cant get all the characters to show up...i tried rearranging the screen rows/columns but that just makes it worse sometimes....btw chaos, you can try it out and lemme know if you get one that shows everyone..just go to the mugen folder, then data, then open up system.def, then scroll down till you reach ""Character select definition"" (its not too far down..roughly 1/4 of the way down) and youll see some values for rows, colums, cell size etc...play arund with the numbers and see if you can get all the characters to show up....besides that if anyone can just give me their numbers they used to show all their characters...ive seen people that have hundreds and theyre all on screen"

,tniemirski,2007-05-09T21:42Z,Imperial also scre around witht he selet def.... with what i have it shows me all the chars... the reason they dont show the others is cuse their for random and ai only beacuse i guess their cheap... play also witht he select def... if ur a nerd like me.. its not hard.. you should b able to get all the chars on one screen

,darcoolio,2008-05-30T20:46Z,"I cant get this to work...Game start to load,and when i press anny button,it crashes..."
,Infamouz88,2008-06-11T06:54Z,"i downloaded the winmugen first and i was upset cuz it kep crashing, so i desided to give this a try and it works very well.. i have vista 84x and it works preety good. I just had problems extracting the files cuz of some txt. files had asian letters and for some reason it detected errors. after some time i was able to get it up and running and i cant complain cuz it works fairly well.. Good upload man thanks.. oh and im seeding like crazzy now lol =)"
,ShutUpFoo,2008-08-20T09:46Z,"http://dinsv.free.fr/dms/down.htm

Go here to download new screenpacks that will allow you to see up to 500 characters."
,FaustSnake,2009-07-13T08:22Z,"What the fuck am I supposed to do with this?
I got a fuckload of files and I know that I sure as fucking Hell ain't gonna start adding every single one to the Mugen game manually.
Is that really what is expected of people?
To add it all on their own?

Fuck, you ought to think that after such a long time you'd be able to just download the fucking game without the incredibly fucking tedious bullshit of changing EVERYTHING yourself.

I know it's freeware but what the fuck?"
,zeon15,2010-06-26T05:14Z,is this the same game as http://www.eyny.com/viewthread.php?tid=2653539 plz reply i really need to now
