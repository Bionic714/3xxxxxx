This is currently the best GBA emulator, and you don\\\'t have to search pages for the bios either, as it is included in this package. Source is included.

Unpack the zip file and copy the gpsp08 folder to your psp\\\'s GAME folder, and launch it. If you got a 2.0+ firmware you will need to get some kind of loader, or downgrade.

As for firmware 1.5, simply copy the gpsp08 and gpsp08% from the gpsp15 folder in the package and place it into your psp\\\'s GAME folder.

PS! you still gotta download roms.
