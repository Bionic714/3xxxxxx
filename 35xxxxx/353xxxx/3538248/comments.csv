,ToMaTe,2006-11-03T23:11Z,"Unpack the zip file and copy the gpsp08 folder to your psp\\\'s GAME folder, and launch it. If you got a 2.0+ firmware you will need to get some kind of loader, or downgrade.

I just downloaded it, so if I have a game for game boy, do I then copy the map and put it in the game boy-game map? is it this that you mean :P ?"

,mkt,2007-02-08T16:06Z,"You will have to downgrade if you have a 3.03 firmware. It is possible, but you need an original copy of the unpatched GTA Libery City Stories. "

,mkt,2009-09-28T21:41Z,"The program itself is old and obsolete, but the BIOS should still work like a charm."
