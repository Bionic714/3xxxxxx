,GasGiver4711,2006-10-01T00:25Z,VaktBleppe : Disk full on xbox ? using latest winrar on pc - FATX errors (do these exist?) on XBOX HDD ?
,shloader,2006-10-01T02:43Z,"Gasgiver... FatX errors do infact happen but I'm unaware of any potential quick fixes such as the Xbox equivellent of scandisk. The times I've encountered corruption I have temporarily installed a modchip and ran XBpartitioner and reinstalled all files for the system partition and another time I simply unlocked the drive in my computer and used Xbox Harddisk Driver to copy over the system and user partitions from a good image. I really hope he's not trying to do a system partition install.

That aside can you do another build off the recent FAT version? Love those scripts and other tweaks you add."
