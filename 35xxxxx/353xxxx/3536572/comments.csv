,feathers632,2006-10-14T14:24Z,"Don't waste your time with this ""repacked"" razor release. It installs ok but when you're in game, all of the in-flight option menus are blank (these menus are accessed via right-clicking while in-flight or on runway).  The menu panels appear but they have no text.  I can't stress how serious this bug is.  The in-flight options menus allow you to change all kinds of in-flight options!

There is another bug...  The wheelbrakes are permanently locked in the ""On"" position.  Pressing ""."" fails to release the brakes.  This means you won't be able to take off in a jet aircraft.  Lame huh?

Razor1911 obviously don't bother to test their games before distributing!

I don't know if the problem is the packing or whether it's down to the Razor dll crack?

Let me stress that downloading the REPACKED DVD1 won't fix these problems!  I suggest you all avoid this Razor release!"
,jigsaw342,2006-10-14T18:44Z,Can someone tell me how to crack it? Im very new to this stuff. is it just like mounting the dvds? 
,feathers632,2006-10-14T19:00Z,"DVD2 contains a directory called ""Razor"" or similar.  In there is a zip with some dll files.  The dll files need to be extracted into the Simulator X folder after install.  After you install the game, when it asks you if you want to ACTIVATE, cancel and close down that window.  Then extract the dll files as described above.

,CashRulz,2006-10-15T14:23Z,"feathers: I didn't have any of those problems. one thing I'm having trouble with tho is that i had to change the throttle up/down keys bc the f1-f12 keys won't work, but I'm pretty sure that's just sumthin with my system.

Anyone else have this problem, or know how I can fix it?

BTW, to all you people with a machine that ISN'T a monster, The game is gonna be choppy unless you make ALL the settings low. Even then, it won't look like what you think it will. This has nuttin to do with the fact that it's a cracked version. This game is massive. It takes about an hour to install, and uses 16GB of space. Think about it, there is an entire worlds worth of scenery...litterally. If your not into flying,  I promise...this isn't the game for you. Go get a war flying game or sumthin so you can blow shit up."
,CashRulz,2006-10-15T14:36Z,"Jigsaw: In the DVD2 file...there is an ISO. file you used to install the game, EXTRACT IT.
there is a file called Razor1911. OPEN IT.
In there is a Crack.rar file. EXTRACT IT.
Inside this are 3 .dll files. COPY THEM. 
Go to your flight simlulator X folder (C:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\Microsoft Flight Simulator X) and PASTE THEM. When it asked if you want to over write the files, click 'YES TO ALL'.

,feathers632,2006-10-15T15:25Z,I'm now wondering if the problem with in-flight menu text is related to my install of XP.  When I installed the pre-release demo last month I had no problem with in-flight menu text displaying.  I just remembered that install was on my other XP (I have multiple installs of XP for games and serious apps).  So I'm going to install on the same XP I installed the demo last month.  I got the locked brakes problem fixed.  All I had to do was assign to a button on joystick.
,feathers632,2006-10-15T16:38Z,"Ok, I've just installed Sim X on my other XP (the one I installed the pre-release demo version on last month).  On this XP the in-flight menu text appears!    
When fonts don't display in-game, Microsoft suggest checking the fonts in windows fonts folder.  There are no fonts missing.  Both installs of XP are using the same video drivers so what's the problem?  Why do the in-flight menus display properly on one XP and not the other? (both installs of XP are from the same CD).  I will try to solve the puzzle.  Finally I must apologise to Razor1911 for saying their Sim X release didn't work.  It works fine!"
,CashRulz,2006-10-15T17:33Z,"idunno, did u completly uninstall the first one that was fucked up b4 you installed this one?"
,feathers632,2006-10-15T18:04Z,"Yup! That's the problem with windows.  It can be screwed up in some small way but you don't even realise.  Then it's impossible to trace the problem.  MS troubleshooting guides NEVER works.  I don't have probs with any other games I install on my games XP (the one that Sim X has the problem with).
Only thing I can do is keep it installed on my serious apps XP where it works properly.
When sim x is running it's a lot of fun. There's a much greater sense of speed in flight compared to previous FS."

When DISK 2 to accuse an error, not clik in OK, goes for the Internet Explorer, opens the folder Program Files/Microsoft Games/Microsoft Flight Simulator X and copies everything for a temporary folder. To follow it copies ALL the archives and folders of the FSXdemo for the created temporary folder and confirms everything. It copies for the same folder crack of the RAZOR1911. It comes back toward the installation of the FSX Deluxe and click in OK. After rolling back, comes back toward the temporary folder and executes the FSX ..........

The two folders each contain a DVD image file in ISO format.

When I first tried mounting the DVD1 ISO file I ended up with only a single text file on the virtual drive.  When I opened this text file is says:

?This disc contains a ""UDF"" file system and requires an operating system 
that supports the ISO-13346 ""UDF"" file system specification.""

The result is the same using the very latest versions of both Daemon Tools and Alcohol 120%.

Despite finding a solution for this problem I am still not sure why some seem to have the above problem and others do not.  It is an issue with the particular Win XP install I suspect.  If anyone can enlighten me I would be very grateful.

To get around this problem you can use the Microsoft Virtual CD Control Tool as follows:

Get the programme from the following link:

http://download.microsoft.com/download/7/b/6/7b6abd84-7841-4978-96f5-bd58df02efa2/winxpvirtualcdcontrolpanel_21.exe 


1. Unzip the download 
2. Run the program file named VCdControlTool.exe from where you unzipped the files in step 1. 
3. In the ""Virtual CDRom Control Panel"" window, click on the ""Driver Control..."" button 
4. In the ""Virtual CD-Rom Driver Control"" window, click on the ""Install Driver..."" button 
5. Choose the file VCdRom.sys from where you unzipped the files in step 1. 
6. In the ""Virtual CD-Rom Driver Control"" window, click the ""Start"" button and then ""OK"" button 
7. In the ""Virtual CDRom Control Panel"" window, click on the ""Add Drive"" button 
8. In the ""Virtual CDRom Control Panel"" window, select the drive that was added instep 8 and then click on the ""Mount"" button 
9. Browse to the location of the ISO image file (?/download path?/DVD1/rzr-fsxf.iso) and select it by clicking in the Open button 
10. In the ""Special Mount Options"" window, click the ""OK"" button 
11. In the ""Virtual CDRom Control Panel"" window, click on the ""OK"" button 
12. Windows Explorer will now show a new drive that contains the contents of the ISO image. 

You can now run the setup.exe from DVD1 to start the installation.

Around halfway through the installation you will be prompted to insert DVD2.

Go back to the Virtual CDRom Control panel and click ?Eject?.  Then mount the DVD2 image in the same way.

The installation will then go on to complete.

Skip the registration screen.

Go to the mounted DVD2 image and in the folder Razor1911 you will find a file called crack.rar.  Extract this and copy the three dll files to:

C:/Program Files/Microsoft Games/Microsoft Flight Simulator X/

Overwrite the existing dll files.

Run the game and everything should work fine.

This worked for me.  The big problem was figuring out why the DVD1 image file would not mount properly."

,monstert,2006-11-05T14:03Z,"Even though there is shed loads of leechers it still seems to be downloading ok. The swarm speed is about 1.2mbps so the seeders are doing great :) I get about 40kbps average then sometimes i get a 210kbs+ burst for about 20mins. If you're getting low download speeds it is most likely your Torrent client/share ratio/upload speed settings/firewall/internet connection causing the problem.
Even if there is 600+ leechers they are still effectively seeding and if they all set their upload speed to 6kbps minimum the swarm speed would be fast as fuck. I've set mine on 15kbps, its not great but least i'm doing my part. If every leecher set their upload setting to 10kbps minimum the download + upload speeds would be so fast that everybody probably would have their copy of FSX within 1-2days. Thanks for sharing everybody though, you guys are awsome."

,monstert,2006-11-06T12:48Z,Yes Maj you need about 16GB in HDD space. Also if you do not have any extra spare HDD space you may find that you will have shit performance. I recommend investing in a bigger HDD. They are cheap enough to buy in todays market. hope this helps :)

Men när jag ska installera det händer ingenting. 
(Jag testade nyss på vår andra mycket sämre dator) och där började installationen i varje fall. 
Jag använder deamon tools. (emulation: all options ON) (och Options: alla förbockade) Jag har försökt trycka på ""DVDCheck.exe"" i DVD2 men absolut ingenting händer. + alla andra installationsfiler (de fungerar men de är ju inte till själva spelet) typ ""DirectX9"". tidigare när jag har installerat spel har jag utforskat och tryckt på ""setup"" eller liknande.

Är det någon som vet hur man aktiverar ""spela upp automatiskt""??

Fick för mig att installationen började med DVD1 men är inte säker. 
men i DVD1 finns bara ett textdokument där detta står: 

""This disc contains a ""UDF"" file system and requires an operating system
that supports the ISO-13346 ""UDF"" file system specification.Q""

,hypschen,2007-01-15T20:18Z,"Here is a quick fix for the install error 1935, whitout installing the FSX demo and adding all the scenery manually.
Install the game.
When the error message 1935 pops up, don't click OK - yet.
Open Windows Explorer and copy the content of the installdir to a new dir.
When copy is complete, confirm error message. Now the install rolls back, and delete the content of the install dir.
In the new dir, where you copied all the files, open the file msxml4.manifest. This should be empty (this is the error). Copy the content form the .manifest file in this link http://flyawaysimulation.com/postp140805.html#140805 (7th post) to your manifest file, and save.
Apply the crack from DVD2.
Start the game with fsx.exe.
If you already have done the install mentioned in an earlier post, where you copy the demo install on top of the full install, and have to add scenery manualy - and haven added all the scenery, and you want to do this quick one that does all the work for you, remember to delete the folder named \documents and settings\all users\application data\microsoft\FSX.
If you don't delete the folder, it will reuse the scenery settings from the demo install."

,Sobbsy,2007-07-02T11:21Z,"I hope someone here can help.

I was given FSX by a friend who downloaded it (who also, like a complete moron, deleted his original install image after installing it, thus only being able to give me the installed game). FSX works just fine, and I used the FSX reg tool to setup my registry properly so that SP1 should recognise and install ok.

Problem is, it doesn't. I haven't installed any addons or anything, only done two flights, and my registry and such is all fine...but when I run the SP1 installer it asks me to install the Original Release of FSX...what gives? Unfortunately I can't install it, and my net's capped so I can't just download it again.

Is there any way to force the SP1 installer to just install without worrying about the game's status? I've spent the last couple of hours finding ways to extract SP1, but it's pointless...I extract the installer, I get the Setup.exe and MSP files. I extract the MSP files (using a neat little MSP extraction tool I found), and I get a CAB file and some MST's. From there, I got nothing. I can extract the CAB file but there's no file structure or file extentions on anything...

So i'm at a loss. Please...someone tell me there's SOME way to install SP1. Some way to extract it, some way to force it to install somewhere where I can just cut the data over...ANYTHING.

Much appreciated :("

,Cobras2,2008-04-05T04:53Z,"I freaking hate copy protection >:(

My disk2 of FSX (the one I BOUGHT from the store for like $70) has a huge crack in it. So what do I do? I make a backup copy of course, before it gets too late and the disk explodes like what happened to my Fallout Tactics CD (which I also bought) a couple years ago. The problem is now the backup copy won't work either.

I'm a Uni student, I don't have time or money to be messing around trying to convince the company to send me replacement disks, or buying replacements of my own, especially when I already bought it once.

Soo... the scene comes to the rescue again! Thank you Razor, you guys rule. Some day the system (copyright) will come crashing down and a new system will take its place. Hopefully it will be a better system that benefits both developers and users; but that is for the future. For now, all we can do is keep fracking up the current system because it NEEDS to fall!"

I downloaded to replace my lost disc 2 and if you do that, you can't mount it. Both it needs both discs to be in the same drive so i had to burn it to recognize the dvd, before it kept saying ""please insert disk"". 

In short: This is the one to download, no issues worked perfectly."
