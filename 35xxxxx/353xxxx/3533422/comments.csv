It definitely slipped through the torrentazos quality control department, because its not fake, none of the tracks have errors, clicks, or are stuffed up, and most importantly, the music is great. Apart from the ""Chiquilla"" track which got alot of radio airplay in 2006, there is the excellent ""parece que va a llover"" and the cheesey ""mami"", plus some nice slower balads that have mariachi-style trumpet. Yes, a couple of the tracks are weak. Anyway, now we know who had all the talent in the Kumbia Kings. Kumbia All Starz, Kings of Kumbia Baby! If you like this, check out Kumbia Kings - Fuego. Please buy the CD if you like it ;-)"
