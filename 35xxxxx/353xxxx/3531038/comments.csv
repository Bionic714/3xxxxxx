,yang_damian,2006-09-29T19:01Z,I can't install deamon tools because the scsi driver it installs ****s up my computer. Does any body know any other mounting program that works with this game?
,Failer,2006-09-29T19:25Z,"Installed it by mounting it with daemon tools. used the serial and tryed to start it by doing:

asr.exe -r ""C:\Games\Caesar IV\CaesarIV.exe""

Got a dialog where I had to choose the CaesarIV.exe file instead but when I choose it I get:

A required security module can not be activated.
This program can not be executed (12004).

Anyone got a solution to this problem?"
,yang_damian,2006-09-29T20:16Z,Yes. You need to start the game from c4exec.exe not from caesariv.exe
,Johnny Zero,2006-09-29T21:17Z,"im not sure about the full game but with the demo the old Curerom didn't work (fucking demos with copyright protection...).

What do you mean when you say you used Curerom but did not patch the .exe? I see only one option and that is to enter in an .exe or else you cannot create a profile. (Sorry never used Curerom before)"
,redly,2006-09-30T02:31Z,"Well, Im going insane trying to get this to work.

Since you haven't updated anything, I can only assume that one of the windows updates is messing things up here, as I'm doing everything you are, in every concievable combination and still no luck."
,Geez48,2006-09-30T02:58Z,"Works fine with the Procyon loader that you can google if you don't have it already included with some other clone releases, or some people have had success with renaming the securom loader file !!"

,redly,2006-09-30T06:11Z,"Okay i got it to work finally. I dont know exactly how, really, after the 3rd hour of trying different methods it finally worked. I think for one thing, you have to turn OFF all emulation on the deamon tools but have CD#1 mounted of course....and don't need Curerom....and use Securom Loader 1.2....should be good to go...

Played first 3 missions....good stuff....but man, small first couple of maps."
,Cornflower,2006-09-30T09:26Z,"Found this, but haven't tested yet:

--------
Had the same problem with SecuROM Loader. After googling around i found a solution. 
1. If by starting the game you get an error message like 
""emulation detected"", you should upgrade to the latest Daemon Tools 4. If the error message is something like ""please insert original disk in drive X"" then upgrading DT is not necessary.
2. Download SR7.Stop, start it, push Hide then close it.
3. Start the game using asr.exe as in the NFO.
4. Don't forget to start SR7.Stop after the game, and unhide the virtual drive.
The game is running just fine.

You can find SR7.Stop here: http://www.cdmediaworld.com/hardware/cdrom/cd_utils_8.shtml

,Baltimore Dank,2006-09-30T10:35Z,"dude, that worked...but, the main reason why i was stumped was that i forgot to mount cd 1 up, i still had cd2 hidden=P so the wrong disc was actually the wrong disc^^ ty"

,Sneltrekker,2006-09-30T11:00Z,Commander. The Security Module error is because you load Caesar IV .exe instead of C4Exec.exe

Well, actually, Balty, your instructions are wrong.  SecuROM_loader should be pointed at c4exec.exe NOT CaesarIV.exe to get this working.

I cannot help peeps who are having trouble running the game due to their PC's being too low spec, as mine too is inadequate.  It looks like this game really does need an up to date graphics card, and many of the problems described above are clearly down to hardware/driver issues.

However, after much agonising, I finally got this installed and here's how I did it:

Download the latest Daemontools
http://www.daemon-tools.cc/dtcc/download.php?mode=ViewCategory&catid=5

Securom_loader 
http://www.daemon-tools.cc/dtcc/download.php?mode=ViewCategory&catid=2

and PrOt.StOp
http://cdmediaworld.com/hardware/cdrom/cd_utils_8.shtml#Pr0t.St0p

INSTALLATION

1. Unpack and install CaesarIV using one of the serials in the .nfo file
2. Delete the 'Play Caesar IV!' shortcut from your desktop (it will never work anyway)
3. Unpack SecuROM_loader to the game directory
4. Rename the SecuROM_loader exe (asr.exe) to something else - suggestion: srmldr12.exe
5. Create a shortcut to the renamed SecuROM_loader, by dragging the renamed exe to your desktop 
6. Right-click on the shortcut, select Properties and in the Target box, add this at the end:
 -r c4exec.exe
(Do NOT point to the game exe CaesarIV.exe at this stage)
So it should read something like: ""C:\Program Files\Caesar IV\srmldr12.exe"" -r c4exec.exe
7.  While in the shortcut Properties, you may also want to click 'Change Icon...' and then browse for the game exe (CaesarIV.exe) to give your new shortcut the appropriate icon, and click the General tab and rename the shortcut to 'Play Caesar IV!'  or whatever you like
8. Install PrOt.StOp anywhere

PLAYING THE GAME

1. Mount CaesarIV disc 1 image (ccd-cr4a.mds) using Daemontools and click 'Exit' if/when the autorun starts the CaesarIV install/play menu
2. Shut down Daemontools (leaving the disk image mounted)
3. Use Pr0t.St0p v1.0 (or similar) to hide all emulated drives... 
4. Uou *may* also have to disable any real optical drives you have - right click and select properties in Explorer, or do it via Control Panel > System > Device Manager.  They can be reenabled from Device Manager without having to reboot.
5. Check your running services to see that Alcohol's Starwind service isn't running
6. Run the shortcut and enjoy!

,lacabarat,2006-10-04T19:12Z,"HI Vice Admiral Jack Sparrow !
in the same way doing you have write, and the link strating

I followed your instruction, and same result...

""A required security module can not be activated.
This program can not be executed (5007).""

I did uninstall the game completely (too many times to mention), and did make sure each and every time that the registry entry for sierra/caesar is removed.

I'm not running (do not even have Alcohol120% installed).  I followed all directions (yours and others' too) all with the same result. "
,Karstoft,2006-10-04T23:00Z,"Okay guys, I've got it!

Do exactly as Vice Admiral Jack Sparrow says first. 
Then in stead of using the ""asr.exe"" file (secuROM_loader 1.2) you need the new version (Securom 7.26). The name of the .exe is here ""procyon.exe"" 
This version works with the ""CaesarIV.exe"" and NOT the ""c4exec.exe"". 
I also renamed the ""procyon.exe"" to a random name. In my case I called it ""nuri"". So the desktop shortcut in this case should be like this ""C:\Program Files\Caesar IV\nuri.exe"" -r CaesarIV.exe


My problem with Vice Admiral Jack Sparrow's instructions was, that when loading the ""c4exec.exe"" with securom 1.2 NOTHING happened. So in short, what did I do different?
1. I used Securom 7.26 instead of Securom 1.2
2. I loaded ""CaesarIV.exe"" in stead of ""c4exec.exe"" So if nothing else works for you, this is the solution.  Please give feedback!"
,cyborg51,2006-10-05T00:59Z,"Karstoft,

Tried it your way too - same result."
,D@NNY,2006-10-05T01:06Z,I'v tried it both ways. Both don't work. I guess this is why everyone was downloading the other C IV torrent and not this one . Anyway maybe a no dvd patch will be released or these people that claim to have got it to work be more specific i'v done exactly as kara and sparrow.
,Vice Admiral Jack Sparrow,2006-10-05T01:59Z,"I'm sorry to see peeps still can't get it working, even though *they say* they've followed my instructions.  I confess I'm no cracking guru, I just hadn't seen anyone post full instructions before, and after I'd read all the threads about this release on every website in the world and tried everything everyone had ever suggested and finally got it working, I thought I'd report back how it worked for me as specifically as I thought possible. :-)

I humbly suggest that those with no disk messages haven't mounted the image properly and those who are still seeing messages like: ""This program can not be executed (5007)"" have not succesfully hidden ALL their disk emulators.  I got that very message when I had anti-blaxx running, but shutting down anti-blaxx it changed number to (12004).

As I understand it Securom 7.26 and Securom_loader 1.2 are different apps and work in slightly different ways."
,shutmeup,2006-10-05T03:14Z,"Ok people, as frustrating as this game is, it DOES WORK! After mounting the image with daemon, run the securom v7.26 and make sure to use the game file from your programs directory and use the CaesarIV one.

,Zetoss,2006-10-05T19:42Z,"Anybody feel like making a site with rankings for cracks, like if a group cracks a game first, they get an award and great reputation? :) How that would be related to this game? A few thousand ppl desperately want a working foolproof damn crack and such a site would show how much we appreciate the groups that crack things and maybe it could help their motivation... :/ wonder if they know how much we really love them"
,cyborg51,2006-10-05T19:51Z,"Zetoss,

Good idea, however I'm in the U.S. and would have the FBI breathing on my neck in no time - see the case of isonews.com."
,Zetoss,2006-10-06T09:51Z,"Maybe it could be done in Sweden, the home of Pirate Bay... There's a few interesting laws over here that could make such a site perfectly legal, but I think asking a lawyer would be a good idea, just to be sure of how to dodge the police :P Anyone know any cheap .swe web hotel that doesn't care too much about the contents on their users sites?"
,3ndy,2006-10-06T12:02Z,"Hi I have had a lot of problems getting this image to worke. But I finaly found a way, its not pretty nifty or some super leet way. its just pure presistens. I had read a lot of post about this problem all over the net. And I finaly came to the conclusion that I did every thing right and there was literaly nothing left for me to try. So here come my advice ""If at first you don't succede, try try again"" I know you might think it wont work and im not sure it will for every one, but for me and on this computer it did, if I just keep on trying like 20 or 30 times in a row, it let me in.
Btw her is my setup:
1. Install the game.
2. Use the Latest Version of Daemon Tool's
3. Mount the Image you Installed the game with for me it's ""D:\Spil\Caesar IV\CD1\ccd-cr4a.mds"" but i guss you can use the mini Image as well.
4. run using Procyon.exe(SecuROM_Loader_v7.26). I use the shortcut on the desktop with a modifide strin so it looks like this """"E:\Games\Sierra\Caesar IV\had.exe"" -r CaesarIV.exe"". it just makes it easier if you have to try it like 30 times!!!
5. Just keep on hitting that button boy.
I was borred and there was Hollowman in the tv that was why I tried this approch ;)
I hope this can help some one. but I guss you have to be pretty desperate to try this...
Btw this ""works"" with version 1.1 as well"
,SpaceZvi,2006-10-06T17:48Z,"Got this problem:
The game worked. Installed it, used daemon tools with emulation options and securom loader 7.26.
Worked just fine!!! UNTIL I tried to start the game the next day and then - ""Insert the original CD and not backup""... any clues?"
,Segersten,2006-10-06T22:22Z,"It works just fine Vice Admiral Jack Sparrow ... 
It takes 10-15 min if you guys do like Vice says .
You do gona need all tree programs "
,mrgreenfur,2006-10-06T22:24Z,"jack sparrow's comments worked great for me. I used dtools and securom 7.26, just like he said."
,hitmizzle,2006-10-07T04:51Z,"the directions posted using sr7.stop program works great. if you are following those directions make sure you use daemon with all options unchecked. then run the sr7.stop program and COMPLETELY CLOSE Daemon (rightclick close) as well as the stop program before using the ASR program to open the game, works 100% of the time even with the patch."
,D@NNY,2006-10-08T01:02Z,"Here's what I did ran daemon tools all emulation options -OFF.
Mounted the .mds file
Exited out of daemon tools
Copyed sr7 and protstop both info my C4 folder and ran them and hide the emulation drives.
Then I clicked the asr.exe program renamed srmldr12 a few times and kept getting  Security module cannot be activated like I'm missing some security files or something. I followed Sparrows and hitmizzles directions what steps am I missing hitmizzle and sparrow?"
,The_Precious,2006-10-08T03:18Z,"Where can i find securom loader 7.26. From where can i download it, can somebody plz tell me."
,The_Precious,2006-10-08T03:27Z,"I've done exactly what Vice Admiral Jack Sparrow said and i couldn't run the game because whenever i click on the shortcut, i keep getting the message: 
Conflict with Disc Emulator Software detected. See http://www.securom.com/emulation_detected for more details. 

So i wanna try Karstoft's method by using Securom 7.26 in stead of Securom 1.2 but i' m looking for Securom 7.26 to download it but i can't find it. 

So can anybody plz tell me where i can find Securom 7.26."
,The_Precious,2006-10-08T14:23Z,Btw i tried Gamecopyworld as zosma suggested and it lead me to a different site where it's not for free. So if anybody knows another way to get Securom 7.26 please let me know.
,D@NNY,2006-10-08T20:37Z,Its there at gamecopy world but using securom 1.27 or 7.6 your still going to get the same results.
,tiivi,2006-10-09T22:02Z,"This may sound stupid, but:
What files i should have? I get CD1, CD2 and info file. In cd file's there's rar-packed files and after unpacking those are mdf, mds and bin files.

So how can i install this game?"
,oboelcke,2006-10-10T00:04Z,"TY for the torrent. Mounted in Daemon ripped to ISOs, burned to disk, installed then applied game copy crack after patching. 
works flawlessly."
,D@NNY,2006-10-10T18:56Z,what's the gamecopy crack a cracked .exe? Also how do you burn image with daemon does that mean mount it? You didn't need daemon or securom to run after installing it and applying the patch?
,D@NNY,2006-10-10T18:57Z,how did you patch from version 1.0 to 1.1 to apply the crack?
,oboelcke,2006-10-10T19:45Z,Mount disks with daemon tools. Convert the virtual disks to ISOs. I used NTI CD/DVD copy but you can use anything. Burned the ISOs to CDs. Used the Cds to install the game. Applied the official patch to ver.1.1. Applied the craked exe found at www.gamecopyworld.com
,_Lightfoot_,2006-10-11T19:41Z,thank you all for taking your time helping... some of us idiots including myself really appreciate your support....

New working crack!"
,mhammett,2006-10-25T04:52Z,"I am using the latest Daemon tools with SecureROM 1.2 and the asr application referencing the c4exec.exe file.  I do not get any error windows.  Whenever I try to run the game, the mouse pointer turns to the arrow\hourglass for a second or two, then goes back to the arrow without running the game.  Any ideas?  I'd rather not buy the game again after I scratch the disk because its used."
,Zaphod9901,2006-10-26T18:46Z,"Well, been following these instructions *to the letter* for hours now. No offence to Jack Sparrow and others, but what worked on your machine doesn't necessarily work on ours.

I have so far downloaded and used:

Daemon Tools 4.06
SR 1.2
Securom 7.26 aka procyon.exe
SR 7Stop
AlkiSecuROM

I uninstalled and scoured the registry repeatedly, changed file names when suggested, unchecked DT options, hid emulators, unpacked into the CIV directory, closed Stop and DT when in use, made sure I had disc one mounted, made shortcuts, added batch files then tried without batch files.. NO SUCCESS, people. All I did was shift the module error message code around (the latest being 5007).

I have work tomorrow morning and am going to sleep. I've downloaded the latest crack, also, and it doesn't seem to help. I am out of ideas. Anyone have any new ones, I'm all ears."
,Zaphod9901,2006-10-26T18:54Z,"OK, un-f**king-believable. When that title screen starts up, it's pure joy.

That new crack works.

I have no idea if all the other protocols were necessary, but I wasn't taking any chances and so used DT and procyon in the recommended way, too. Man oh man. Long night."
,tubarao21,2006-11-02T00:43Z,"So, like a big majority of us, it was hard for me to put it to work. I was having the error:

""A required security module can not be activated.
This program can not be executed (5007)."" 

But i got it!

Worked with me. I hope it works for you.

I uninstalled Caesar IV, and Alcohol 120%. I was working with Alcohol, it could work, but as i have seen in great part of this comments, i changed to Daemon Tools.

After uninstall this, i used Registry Mechanic hoping to clean values of Caesar IV from my Registry.

From here, i installed Daemon Tools 4.06 ( http://www.free-downloads.net/downloads/Daemon_Tools/ ). Then, i mounted the image with Daemon and installed the game. In this process, you have to mount CD2 image (of course).
IMPORTANT: after installing, don't forget to mount the CD1 image again.

Then, i used Securom Loader 7.26 Procyon ( http://ww2.cdmediaworld.com/hardware/cdrom/cd_utils_8.shtml  ). 
I put Procyon.exe in the Caesar IV directory ( C:\Program Files\Sierra\Caesar IV\ ), and then double click it. Now specify the game executable (CaesarIV.exe).

Now, it should work.

NOTE: Don't forget to shut down Anti Blaxx, shut it in Task Manager to be sure :)

Hope it works."

- Install winrar.
- Extract CD1 and CD2 by rightclicking the ccd-cr4a.rar and ccd-cr4b.rar respectively.
- Install Daemon tools.
- Install game by mounting CD1 with Daemon. ALT-TAB to mount CD2 when prompted.
- Get securom loader here http://www.daemon-tools.cc/dtcc/download.php?mode=ViewCategory&catid=2 
- Run the securon loader (asr.exe?) and point the way to the game .exe on harddisk in the game installation dir.
