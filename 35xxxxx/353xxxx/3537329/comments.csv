,blemishednicely,2007-11-20T09:39Z,"I can't get this to run! I managed to get it into the installer(w/ shot o/ Alien&Predator facing each other), but during the setup it asks for cd 2-all I seem to be able to load are the CCD & CUE IMAGE discs, but neither works! Both fail verification....mer? No idea WTF's up. "
,blemishednicely,2007-11-22T08:20Z,"I dunno, I've tried all I can think of and no success---anyone know how to run this? What to do/use? Want this game badly, but about to say fuck it....any advice would be helpful!"
,blemishednicely,2007-11-23T06:56Z,"My cheeks are redder than a German fetish shop...I must be completely fucking retarded, the second CD (for verification) you need to mount is MUSIC 2, then it'll pass verification, then reinstall the game 1 disc...runs great, it's just my brain that's defective....some things'll never change. I was so hung up on loading GAME DATA, I didn't even consider the MUSIC folder until closer examination---game is as it should be, but running other prog's. simultaneously tends to start sound glitches & load lag , usual stuff 4 games, totally authentic AVP FPS. GReat job, nagoo and sorry for my prior stupidity. *blushing*"
,Sorvos,2007-11-24T13:33Z,"It doesn't work! I installed it nice and easy, entered the game, changed the settings all nice and fine, but when I start playing it doesn't work. The movie works, but all I can see isthe HUD. The rest is all black. I can't see the gun, hands, tail what so ever. But I can strike and shoot with the guns and the noise works, but I can't see anything. To put it loudly, I CAN""T PLAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Does this game WOK on XP?????? Because I'm desperate and I want to play it!"
,black-black,2007-11-26T12:03Z,"SEED LIKE HELL

,Sorvos,2007-12-18T14:57Z,No wonder it's not working on my system. I've got XP. In the readme it says it requires Windows 95 or 98. Too bad!!!!!!!!!!!! Alien vs Predator 2 and Primal Hunt were so cool. I would love to play the original. :((((((((((((((((
,Kenny5555555,2008-01-05T21:35Z,Can anyone write a stepp by stepp instructsion on how do install the game i realy need help? thank you!
,mr.serv-on,2008-02-04T05:33Z,"My system must be incredibly slow b/c I'm using Vista and can play it without changing the games compatibility. Plays perfectly except for one thing that happens to me once in a while. Before a mission the last sound heard will keep looping but it can be fixed by saving and loading. Also, this game is very hard and surprisingly scary. If your up for a challenge then suit up and move out."
,Koshh,2008-03-05T05:42Z,"the game installs fine and runs fine. unfortunately it seems that i and a few others have a problem where the right side of the screen won't display. i looked around for fixes on the internet and couldn't find any. 

:C and i was looking forward to playing this again too"
,Zerko,2008-04-12T19:02Z,"How do i mount cd2???
I tried installing the game with just cd1 but that didnt work.... 
blemishednicely tried to explain how to do it but trying to understanding his english just got me more confused, so if anyone knows how to fix the problem with cd2 i plz tell me!"
,Kjub,2008-05-03T15:37Z,"If you have any problems with sound on loop when you try to skip movies. And if game won't load lvls. Try to rename avp.exe. I know it sound crazy but im serious. It helped me! I just dicovered it and i was like ""wtf O_o""."
,Kjub,2008-05-03T15:38Z,"Oh and forgot to say. Yes, I have WinXP sp2. Game runs smoothly."
,lynchie113,2008-05-31T17:50Z,"Alright, for all of you that are having a hard time running this, here's how it should go.  I'm running a dual core processor with an 8800 on XP and these settings work completely.

First off, right click the avp.exe in your Program Files\Fox folder and set the compatibility mode to Win 95.

Launch the game, and for those of us with dual core processors immediately alt tab out and alt ctrl delete.  Select the processes tab and look for avp.exe.  Right click the exe and choose set affinity.  There should be two checkboxes, one for CPU 0 and the other for CPU 1, uncheck CPU 0 and have only CPU 1 checked.

That SHOULD be it, someone said that changing the name of avp.exe worked, so if you have any other problems see if changing that works out for you.  The only problem I have with the game right now is that the text in the menu screens overlay when choosing to save game etc.

Hope this works for you"
,lynchie113,2008-05-31T18:10Z,"As for the mounting process it should go

CD 1
Setup Stops
CD 2
Setup Stops Again
CD 1
Install"
,roccorules,2008-07-02T23:03Z,"FIX FOR LOOPING SOUND:

Download Binkw32.dll from dll-files.com and place this in your AVP directory.

The game is said not to work with any GeForce 8 driver.. It has no problems with dual core processors however."
,xvfranco,2008-07-05T10:49Z,"Downloaded and installed just fine.  When I started a single player, I got a blurred HUD and all the ambient lighting trailed on the screen, eventually the lighting took up the whole screen.  Couldn't see anything else, even at the start.

I'm using Vista with a 9800GTX."
,mikeyrocko,2008-08-01T11:44Z,"Disc 2 won't mount with Power ISO, Disc 1 will mount. But when it ask's to insert disc 2, and I go to mount it and it says ""The file format is invalid or unsupported"" I can't get it to read disc 2. I've downloaded this torrent 4 times from seperate sites, No luck with this one. Any advice would be grealty apreciated. I really don't want to give up on it."
,mikeyrocko,2008-08-01T11:49Z,"For those of you, who got it installed, The program you used to mount the discs would be of great help. I guessing that might be the problem?"
,nattblind,2008-08-19T14:58Z,"Mikeyrocko, use daemontools"
,janus87,2008-10-05T10:43Z,"notes:
1)While running under winXPsp2,  if your graphic card is nvidia(GeForce4+) than to run you'll must install 94.24 drivers.
2)To fix ""sound loops"" you'll must download and copy to game's dir binkw32.dll [""as also said roccorules""]"
,Inzeert,2009-01-28T17:06Z,"Why does it say that the cd-verfication didn't work? 
any ideas how to install this? if someone that has installed this game and it does run smoothly why can't you just write how you did and so on. I have tried everything, doesn't it work with Daemon tools?"
,shang_master,2009-04-09T01:09Z,"hey guys....my graphics on the game dont show up at all.  sounds not a problem, but the visuals dont show at all...."
,Chmmr,2009-06-24T17:33Z,"For those of you using xp or vista and having graphic or sound trouble. http://forums.gamespy.com/tech_support/b49029/1049364/p1 source code patch, enjoy."
,Kanano,2009-07-27T11:57Z,"I used CloneCD to burn the game myself, and it installed fine.

,SNES_VS_PS1,2009-11-03T14:47Z,FUCK!IT HAS A TROJAN-_-
,DrBaronvonEvilSatan,2009-11-30T12:52Z,"Alright, so I've gotten this to work finally, and thought I'd help out anyone still wondering.

Install the game from the disc 1 setup.exe.

Patch the game to version 1.0.9.6.

Download a crack for said version of the game, then replace the avp2.exe in your game installation (C:\Program Files\Fox\Aliens vs. Predator 2  or whatever) with the crack.

Your game should work flawlessly, without needing to copy the ISO's or whatever to another disc. That, and all of these necessities can be found with a simple google search.

Or, if you'd like, try these:

Patch: http://www.filefront.com/845631/AvP2-Update-1.0.9.6-English/
Crack: http://www.freeinfosociety.com/site.php?postnum=907

Hope this helps you out; I've always liked this game, but I broke my CD."
,xxkubax,2009-12-30T15:23Z,shit !! rootkit and trojan inside..... !!
,ncc46537,2010-03-13T07:24Z,"What do people not understand about the fact that cracked programs and keygens are counted as trojans?
Seriously?
IT IS FUCKING NORMAL.
It IS A TROJAN but it is NOT anything to worry about as unlike the trojan viruses you idiots might download from porn sites the ones in keygens are NOT going to allow access to your computer."
,mandarp,2010-05-14T16:36Z,"Hi

Is this AVP 1 or AVP 2, i'm looking for  AVP 1"
,imgayay,2011-01-23T07:10Z,"Works fine. No viruses.
Singleplayer is pretty annoying tho with the looping soundtrack? Is there a way to disable the soundtrack?"
,Zenxmetal,2011-01-29T22:30Z,Is this the New One?? Also is it in English. 
,chint3,2011-04-07T07:56Z,"COOL game it worked
