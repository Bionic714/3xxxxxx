,FaderAbraham,2006-09-28T21:22Z,What about subs?
,ReVIsed,2006-09-29T15:05Z,mongodlx: You're probably right. With the extras this movie is about 3 hours anyway. FaderAbraham: No subs. But you can write some. :)

I would buy several copies of it, if I could, but I live in Sweden, so it's too much of a hassle to import."
,EmoStar,2007-05-22T10:11Z,How is the quality? Want 2 b able 2 read the txt in the movie. Only seen the youtube/google.video posts b4.
,PspLoverX,2007-06-11T19:43Z,"The quality is good.

Alex is releasing a new versions of Terrorstorm in a few months or so though, which he's said will look better... But until then, this one's just fine!"
,PspLoverX,2007-06-16T00:08Z,"The title of this torrent may be confusing for some people...

This is not THE ""Final"" version of Terrorstorm.

Alex Jones will be releasing a new updated version of TERRORSTORM soon, which he calls ""Special Edition"" and he sometimes refers to it as Final, or Final Cut.

This is what I'm talking about http://infowars-shop.stores.yahoo.net/tesped.html

BTW, I'm NOT spamming!! Just trying to help."
,caspersim,2007-11-25T18:09Z,"Im not new to torrents, but i have always avoided ""VIDEO TS/"" because I cant quite figure out how to make them work.
I use: winRAR,
UltraISO premium or PowerISO and Nero to do my torrents.
Could someone please give me a walk through. I feel like a noob."
,mythicshadow,2008-04-25T13:35Z,"i've been burning up my internet bandwidth for weeks now getting everything i can find on this topic. in the beginning i felt completely stunned. my whole world paradigm that i had lived in comfortably since my birth was suddenly and abruptly smashed to pieces with a finality that told me there was no going back. my new and much more accurate world view is still being constructed and i will take a while to digest all the new parameters. at first i was terrified. then i said...well fuck.. it the USA's problem. then i got pissed when i realized it's everyones fucking problem. if america goes..that's it. we are all fucked. hang on to your guns boys and if you need some help, i'm there for you in any capacity.   mythiconshadow...canada"
,level1online,2008-11-01T19:50Z,"It's easy to burn these VIDEO_TS/ files with Nero. I'm using version 6, a feature called ""Burn DVD-video files"" on Nero SmartStart.

Also, a program I use to preview these files is Intervideo WinDVD7. You go to Source > DVD From Folder... > then select the VIDEO_TS folder."
