,Sandman15886,2006-10-09T01:05Z,this is also a universal patch that can be used on any slysoft product
,daryl1,2006-10-09T02:13Z,This has an old patch file that doesn't work with 6.0.8.0
,DanPainter,2006-10-09T03:27Z,can anyone else verify if this patch works for this version?
,Daemon85,2006-10-09T03:28Z,"the Slysoft Products Generic Crack from SnD have never worked one singel time for any of the fucking slysoft programs, dont understand what they are going, always have to get other cracks"
,dsanchez,2006-10-09T06:00Z,I have downloaded and tried to use this version. It installs fine of course and then cracks just fine as well however while decrypting a dvd the program closes out and goes to the slysoft anydvd download page. I have tried 3 different dvd's and each time any dvd bombs out and closes then takes you to the slysoft webpage. No luck so far actually using this version of anydvd.
,greybigtop,2006-10-09T06:54Z,"The ""Generic"" patch has ALWAYS worked just fine!
But funny enough you actually have to use the right one.............
The sweet people behind it has even been kind enough to number the issues, so even the IQ-challenged has a chnace of getting it right.
In this case you need version 1.35!
Bon appetit."
,greybigtop,2006-10-09T06:56Z,"And of course you have to prevent AnyDvd from calling home!
To be 100% sure use a manually configured firewall."
,greybigtop,2006-10-09T07:15Z,"Actually the included patch works just fine as well.
All you have to do is:

1:
Prevent AnyDvd from calling home

2:

Exit AnyDvd in the toolbar BEFORE applying the patch."
,ianken_ms,2006-10-09T09:25Z,WTF is the point of a crack if it leaves the phone-home code in the app? Seriously.
,msmilam,2006-10-09T09:35Z,"to prevent it from calling home,
all you do is just go into pref. and unclick auto update option, right?
cuz, if thats not how, then thats weird cuz it never attempts to call home for me, and ive been using all the version up until this one.
now if this one is the only version to have call home feature, then it makes sense."
,greybigtop,2006-10-09T11:03Z,"Stay with version 6070 for a little while, the frequent issue of new versions are not neccesarily for our benefit only and you can copy 99,99% of all DVD´s with this anyway.
It appears that there is indeed some trouble with some DVD´s on some PC´s as described earlier, even when disconnected from the net."
,kiczek,2006-10-09T12:15Z,"THIS is BOGUS and the SnD patch this guy added with it is not Legit or the Latest version from SnD

,Daemon85,2006-10-09T15:34Z,"i have version 1.36 of the crack, the crack have never worked and i have tried all releases way before 1.20. always find a crack the next day or so that works so its strange that this crack would work at all, maybe just noobie work"
,KalleSpion,2006-10-10T00:45Z,"This one doesnt work
