The account that shows up when you need to authorize is needing a password, so you cannot hack this. If by any chance you do get the passwords for all the games because they are different users, there is no point. Apple lets you have 5 maximum machines that are authorized for the content, so if many people download this and keep authorizing, then once they get to 5, they have to de-authorize all the other machines so they can use it, which would then keep repeating itself so no one can actually keep it authorized for their self.

Okay, heres what you need...

-iTunes 7.0 (with account)
-WinRar
-Tetris 1.0 (ipg) (but I think it will work the same for the other games since all of them has the specific file.)

-iPod 5G (1.2)

Step One:
You will need to get your hands on a copy of the tetris ipg, now open it WinRar ""BUT DONT EXTRACT IT""

Step Two:
Midway down the name of files should be a file called ""ITunesMetaData"", drag this out of the list to your desktop, and DONT CLOSE WINRAR
(You will find the file inside WinRars archive once you've opened [the game file].ipg with WinRar)

Step Three:
Open the ""iTunesMetaData"" file with notepad. Somewhere you should see an E-Mail address, this is who originally brought the game. Change this to the E-mail account that you use with your ITMS account and then save the file.

Step Four:
Drag the file back into the list of files in WinRar, it will ask you wether you want to replace the file or update it, Make sure you replace it.

Step Five:
Close WinRar, open iTunes and drag the Tetris IPG into the iPod games tab, Double click Tetris and authorise it using your account and password. It should say it was successful, The next time you sync your Ipod it will be copied over and be playable under games, enjoy!"
