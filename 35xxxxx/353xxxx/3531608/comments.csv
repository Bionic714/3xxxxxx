,RedRaider,2006-10-06T21:57Z,You must be retarded if you can't play it...
,death734,2006-11-26T20:40Z,"redraider is right

its very simple to play this. get VLC or this download of tcpmp player http://www.mytempdir.com/1077848 or get the CCCP codec thing

x264 is dominating 1.1-1.4gb rips xvid and 720p is geting alot less frequent because x264 does give much better video quality than xvid"
,ultrapiratebuffer,2007-04-08T16:06Z,Matroska? wtf? i thought ppl. stopped using M in the late 90s. File is stated as neat mpeg4 .h624 with AC3 sound. why would ANYONE put this in a matroska container and not in an .avi or .mp4? FILESIZE?
