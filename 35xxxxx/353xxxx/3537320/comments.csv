,Roger5000,2006-10-16T23:47Z,"I would like to THANK EVERYONE who have SEEDED Prison Break Season one!!!

Adjusting your life after when TV programs go instead of the other way around doesn't always work to great (plus there is so damn much comercial on TV), but thanks to you all seeders (yes I seeded some myself to) I have not missed a single Episode up to Episode 19. Then I saw S01E20 when it aired on TV and then decided I wanted the box.
Ordered the complete first season and got it today and watched the last 2 episodes from the DVD today. 2 days before the DVD release in my country. :)
If it wasn't for you guys I would probobly have missed a few episodes and not got the official DVD box.

Who said piracy isn't a good promotion to get the legal DVDs/Albums etc of the things you really like!? :)

Again. Thank you all seeders out there!"
,SirLauren,2006-10-17T10:26Z,Please seed ! 
,Viru,2006-10-18T12:20Z,"I got till 16% by downloading the file S01E15 from another torrent, including the complete file in this folder torrent, and finally ""Force Re-check"" of this. Obviously I have lost some parts (head and tail of the file), but at least now all we will have some more data to share. Why don't you all try the same? We will still have problems with some parts (those involving two files), but at least we won't be so dependant on seeders."
,SirLauren,2006-10-18T12:30Z,Come on seed plz.. im stuck on 12.5 % 
,Viru,2006-10-18T23:41Z,"Hi again! Using the trick descibed above I got till 70% while all the peers I see are stuck at 16%. Plz, try it so we can reach 100% even without a seed!"
