,immagical,2011-12-30T13:50Z,"whats the quality like people..   V-* A-*???

soon as i get this i will leave it seeding,  i only get a max download speed of 3.5 mbpsbut it will only download a file from here at 420kb/s max  and upload speed of .076 mbps and i dont restricted the upload so it will only upload the maximum i get as this isnt slowed from me ISP,  dont understand why the downloads are slowed but not the uploads. hope it still helps as i see a load of tight ass's out there hit and runing or given speeds of .05 kb/s quite shit if you ask me 

does anyone ells notice this or have this happen to them..  soon as it hits 18:00 hours here in uk my conection drops big time and i dont get any download speeds on here above 10kb/s where it will run at 420kb/s download but soon as 6 o'clock pm comes speed hits rock bottom, no joke 1 second past six every night and evry night in the week this happens..  is this a isp thing ????"
