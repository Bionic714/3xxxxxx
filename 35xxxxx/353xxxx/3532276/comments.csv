,harpseal,2007-04-12T00:39Z,"This is a really great album! I may have to go out and BUY the other one, since it's not here (I don't think). 

Sounds a bit like fellow Skandinavians Motorspsycho, I suppose. Sometimes like the Japanese bads Ghost and Acid Mothers Temple. But I hear strong evidence of obvious influences: Gong, Black Sabbath, Jethro Tull (gulp), others. 

I downloaded this thinking it was some '60s obscure psych band. It's not! It's an obscure (at least in North America) psych-prog-metal band. 

Excellent! My favorit enew discovery!"

Very cool.  First Band From Outer Space is great stuff for those of us who enjoy spaced out music."
