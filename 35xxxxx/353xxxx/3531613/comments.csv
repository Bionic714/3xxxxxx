,bigairman,2006-10-03T04:01Z,We really need a serial. Not very popular to get a keygen.
,Ashie^,2006-10-04T07:37Z,Serial anyone? :P
,bigairman,2006-10-05T01:38Z,Someone should ask on itgfreak.com

,heffarumpel,2006-10-08T16:28Z,"a guy at the bemanistyle forum claims that it is possible to skip the cdkey vertification, anyone knows how to do this?

http://www.bemanistyle.com/forum/showthread.php?p=114014

or has anyone found the cdkey yet? searched everywhere, cant find it, want to play itg!!"
,bigairman,2006-10-08T20:45Z,"He probably used a repcker to get those extra songs.
Well, I got the songs working through a demo. I took the packs from the original a popped them into the demo /pcks. Just flip around things from the original directory and the demo directory. From here:
http://stepmania.naota3k.com/index.php?dir=ITG%20PC
It might have been beta 2 that worked.
But that means all the expert steps are locked and only the ITG1 theme can be used. To fix the expert steps, I used edit mode to access them and create edit steps."
,mobius35,2006-10-09T00:58Z,"There is a crack out there somewhere for it, it's difficult sometimes to get it working but there is. But the way it works is that the pck's are extracted into a directory and a line in the preferences file is overwritten permenantly. This means that the standard ITGPC works, but...

When you install the R2 update (itg2 + songpack a) all hell breaks loose.

Someone post a cd key please... it'd be way easier............"
,vlal5,2006-10-09T02:59Z,We really need a serial/cd-key or this is useless.... theres got to be one floating around somewhere....
,banzaigtv,2006-10-09T07:41Z,"This torrent is useless. Since there is no cdkey, please remove this torrent. It's just a waste of bandwidth and a waste of everybody's time. You cannot run all features on it. Everyone, just purchase the game. This file will never work."
,heffarumpel,2006-10-09T16:59Z,There must be a key floating around somewhere on the web..! keep the torrent running until someone finds a key...!

,Groove26,2006-10-09T19:34Z,"Ow, I'm sorry, but the crack I have isn't a serial or cd key, It's the thing what mobius35 already explained, a 'pack rewriter'.."
,mobius35,2006-10-11T02:55Z,"This file will be totally functionable and a great resource as soon as someone feels generous enough to throw up a serial key. Believe me, there are none on the web as of last week at least, or if there are they didnt show up on 3 of my hack resource sites and 4 different search engines... >_>

Please share."
,Ashie^,2006-10-11T09:07Z,Serials have the habit of eventually showing up. :)
,Groove26,2006-10-11T11:33Z,"Ok well, like all of you, I'll keep on searching for a key... There's got to be someone who has one. Or you can just run to the store and copy a key from the back of a original game :)"

,bigairman,2006-10-12T02:42Z,"Well, if there is a high enough demand, someone will make a keygen...

,TornadoTK,2006-10-12T02:51Z,"I also request, but I doubt any teams would work on an ITG keygen."

,vlal5,2006-10-14T23:22Z,"If you do make one, I would recommend installing the ITG2 update patch first, and then working from there.... I think ITG2 is one of the main reasons why people would want this anyway, since ITG1 is old and has been out for PS2 over a year anyway..."
,Talismn,2006-10-15T05:57Z,"I've managed to crack it by replacing the PCK File that keeps asking for the stupid Product Key, but everytime I do that, no songs can be played.

,Groove26,2006-10-15T19:23Z,"Ok this 'crack', is just the repacker we talked about before.. We're looking for an actual crack, or an repacker that repacks ITG2 as well..

grz "
,Talismn,2006-10-15T23:27Z,"I have the Repack, but have no idea how it works"
,neothe0ne,2006-10-16T02:03Z,"The ""crack"" works with the ITG patch R2 as well.  Just open Extract.exe in command prompt and direct it to the folder where you installed the ITG2 patch to.

But yeah, a repacker would be great, because this is eating my hard drive space away at the moment."
,GAMERJET,2006-10-16T03:15Z,"neothe0ne, are you sure that you got the ""crack"" to work with the patch? When I have used extract.exe, all that I get extracted is the standard ITG PC stuff, just out of pack form. With ITG PC + patch R2 you should have a total of 128 songs, but even with the extract.exe's extracted stuff you still only have 81 songs (The original ITG PC). Mabey I'm misunderstanding what you are saying, but as far as I can tell, it won't work with the patch R2. Also, Keygen requested!"
,bigairman,2006-10-16T03:20Z,"Are you talking about just extracting it? 
Could there be a way to rewrite the crack.bat to include the itg2 pcks?"
,Talismn,2006-10-16T03:57Z,"In order to get all the songs from In the Groove, In the Groove 2, and in the Groove 3, open the 3D or the In the Groove file to install the thing, and go to: In The Groove PC\In The Groove\In The Groove.app\Contents\Resources.

There should be a folder saying ""pcks"". Drag that folder over the Extracter and it'll extract all songs from the game itself."
,Talismn,2006-10-16T03:57Z,"Sorry, it's CD not 3D --;;;"
,GAMERJET,2006-10-16T05:23Z,"For some reason I had to drag and drop each pck file for it to extract them, but it does work anyways, extracting all of the files from the packs. Anyways, I was looking at these files and I see that the step files have the extension .SM (Which is the same format that stepmania uses). So I figured, what would happen if I put these files into stepmania. Well, it doesn't work like it should have! Here's the problem with trying to do this, stepmania will either read the step files just fine and won't play the music, or it will not read the step files and the music will play. Quite confusing, yes? :) I actually thought this would (And it should have) worked. I'll keep messing around with these files and stepmania. If anyone has any thoughts on this, please comment!"
,mobius35,2006-10-16T06:25Z,"I'm going to try the method suggested 2-3 posts above, with the drag and drop, but it'd still be cool for a CD key, or a simpler crack be put together. THis is eating up my HD space as well."
,Ashie^,2006-10-16T19:05Z,A serial or a keygen requested! These cracks aren't very effective solutions. :)
,vlal5,2006-10-16T21:59Z,"Cheers, dude, you rock!"
,GAMERJET,2006-10-17T00:33Z,"cypherz, every time I use this new ITG 2 crack you made, all it does is extract all pck data and puts it into the In the Groove folder, out of pck form. At least thats what happens each time I follow your readme.txt directions. Are you sure that your crack allows you to play ITG PC with patch R2? After using your crack and then running ITG PC, it cuases it to revert back to R1 with 0 songs! If I'm doing something wrong, please let me know, but again, I followed the directions given in the readme.txt; so IDK...
If anyone has gotten this new crack to work as stated in cypherz's post above, please share how you got it to work! Thanks! :)"
,Talismn,2006-10-17T01:06Z,"That Crack did not work for me at all. It does the exact same thing. Granted I can get through the Product Key request, unlock all the songs, but I still get the results of no songs being loaded. It's that DD70BA0B.PCK that's the problem. It allows you to get through that annoying Product Key requestion, but that's all it does. Can't play the songs regardless."
,vlal5,2006-10-17T03:46Z,"I got it to work perfectly. What I did was this: use nero to burn the ITG files on to a CD-R, installed the game and then installed the ITG2 Upgrade patch (most of us waiting for the crack should have had this done by now, it was simply a matter of waiting). Then I went into edit the crack file, made sure that the parts he specified were pointing to the correct folder (down towards the bottom, I just had to change ""Administrator"" in the location paths to ""Owner"", make sure you get this part right for whatever path you need), and simply double clicked the crack, it took a good 5 minutes to extract everything.... and voila.... ITG2!!!"
,bigairman,2006-10-17T03:54Z,"Hmm, I can't get this crack. Rapidshare isn't responding well, and the one on here isn't seeded well. Could someone reupload it to rapidshare?"
,mobius35,2006-10-17T04:59Z,Someone seed the crack or reupload it. Neither is working at the moment.
,GAMERJET,2006-10-17T07:21Z,"JACKPOT! I've finally got it to work! :) 
Thankyou vlal5 and cypherz! Everyone, do exactly as they have told us to. It DOES WORK!
Thankyou guys so much!!!! Now, I'm off to play ITG 2 PC! :) :) :)"
,bigairman,2006-10-18T00:54Z,"Great, I got the crack and it works.
Remember, if you have the old crack installed, you have to reintall ITG and the song pack A before you try the new crack."
,unohoo,2006-10-18T21:13Z,"""bemaniso.ws"" had two different cd key's in their torrent for this (well, it's mentioned in the comments).  Unfortunately, my account was banned and I think you have to be invited to get in now.  I'm also in need of the cd key because I just put this on my new computer.  If anybody can get into bemaniso or if I can get an invite, I'll post the cdkey here."
,cainz,2006-10-19T00:15Z,"I downloaded ""In The Groove for PC\MAC"" and the crack, and I think I succefully cracked the game (a lot of folders appeared afterwards). Am I doin it rite? Cuz it still asks me for a CD-key..."
,bigairman,2006-10-19T00:48Z,"To DJBon, did you edit the crack.bat? First of all, read the READ ME. Right click the crack.bat and select edit. It will open notepad and scroll to the bottom. It will say something like 
MD ""C:\Documents and Settings\Administrator\My Documents\In The Groove""
I had to change it to
MD ""C:\Documents and Settings\HP_Administrator\My Documents\In The Groove""
Find your ""My Documents"" and make sure the directory is correct."
,Talismn,2006-10-19T02:01Z,YES!!!! I finally got the stupid thing to work!!! Got my Metal Pad hooked up and I'm in freaken business!!! Thanks people
,Rumble_Bee,2006-10-19T12:45Z,"Got the whole thing working 2. But still one problem is making me trouble...
If I try to play the Survival Mode, this error appears: 
Crash reason: metal
(...)
Someone got the same problem and know how to fix it? I don't want to do something that I regret after..."
,bigairman,2006-10-20T00:28Z,"About the survival glitch, I simply put on 2 players and it works."
,vlal5,2006-10-20T17:41Z,"The only problem I have with this crack is that it seems to bump the program back to the more buggy R1, and installing R2 again makes all the songs disappear. I'm having some pretty bad lag problems, with keyboard even, and the game is very hard for me to play visually this way. I think R2 might help that a bit. A cd key would really be ideal.

Since ITG is pretty much assumed dead anyway, getting one soon would be nice since this game is going to be hard to by soon anyway."
,vlal5,2006-10-20T17:42Z,"Oh and the songs seem all synced evenly for me... but using the calibrate audio sync i get a value of -30ms, and while it syncs everything audially, I have to hit the arrows well before they have reached the target zone, which is unnaceptable."
,Talismn,2006-10-21T05:35Z,"I never had problem in the Survival Mode or any other modes. Hell I even got all of my songs from DDR to play in In the Groove. I have over 500 songes loaded now from In the Groove 1,2,3 and all of DDR Mixes"
,vlal5,2006-10-21T06:13Z,"I said ITG is presumed dead because the rights have been bought by Konami, but that's discussion for another time and place.

As for the serial, well, the Bemaniso tracker has one, but it appears as if they've shut their doors to new users for good now. They certainly are good at keeping themselves underground. I feel left out, cause I only just learned about them :("
,Talismn,2006-10-21T17:45Z,"Where I'm from, In the Groove is a big hit and has beaten Dance Dance Revolution badly. I mean lets face it. In the Groove is incredibly harder than DDR. If you go to Anime, Comic, or any other related Conventions, they always have In the Groove Contests instead of DDR and from my experience in both Games, In the Groove is way better and more fun. Even though it's bad to have those mines in it, but still it's fun as hell trying to avoid them. I fell off the damn pad trying to avoid those things I dunno how many times LMAO"
,vlal5,2006-10-21T22:04Z,"First of all, tell your friend that brute forcing a key that comprises of 25 digits is just flat out impossible. Second of all, lets leave the DDR vs. ITG arguments out of this discussion, please?"
,neothe0ne,2006-10-21T23:27Z,"The only case I've ever heard where it's possible is with StarCraft, which is just 16 integers.  This key is 25 characters which could be numbers or letters at random.  I'd say it's practically impossible."
,Scaraflipper,2006-10-23T01:30Z,Could someone please be so kind and post the CD-key? I wanna play this great game there is no way to buy it in Germany.
,shuruka,2006-10-24T22:21Z,"ummm i have a problem, i installed itg plus the R2, then after i apply the crack, i get the itg 1 theme and i can only get 31 unlocks which are useless cause there are no songs to play, what did i do wrong?"
,Talismn,2006-10-25T20:09Z,"I've been doing some experiment on these cracks and figured out the secret and what result I've been getting from other people. Basically it doesn't matter what version you install. It could be the In the Groove PC, or both with the ITG2 Pack.

The only thing you have to do is just edit the crack itself. Basically once you right click on it, it pretty much gives you a list on what's going to be extracted. The only thing you have to do is look at the links that shows where your ""My Documents"" are. You have to change the right link to your current one, because ALL computers aren't the same. Do that, save it, then click on it. That's it. All song including the game itself works."
