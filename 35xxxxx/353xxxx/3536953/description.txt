Set in 2010, the sci-fi equivalent of next Tuesday, and with a passing nod to last summer?s Paris riots, the capital?s suburbs have been transformed into a psychedelic version of Pimp My Ride. Sealed inside a giant wall, the lowlife occupants of District 13 are ruled by the drug-addled comedy gangster Taha (Bibi Naceri) and his motley crew of Goldie Lookin? Chain rejects. When the dimwits mysteriously acquire a massive bomb and trip the 24-hour fuse, elite cop Damien (Rafaelli) teams up with local resident and crime stopper LeÃ¯to to save the day.

\\\\\\\"A SUPER-SIZED DIET OF INCREDIBLE ACTION\\\\\\\"

With a sub A-Team plot and acting that makes the Teletubbies look like a Chekhov play, District 13 survives solely on its super-sized diet of incredible action and pounding beats. Both Raffaelli and Belle (the latter Parkour?s inventor) execute their own stunts, which gives the film a non CG-enhanced realism, stylishly captured by first-time director Pierre Morel. Instantly forgettable, but hugely entertaining for 85 minutes.
