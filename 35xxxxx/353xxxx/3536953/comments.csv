,sabretooth1,2008-07-16T23:05Z,"The best version of D13 by far! French with English subtitles keeps the originality of the movie. Do not watch any other version (unless you want to take this piss out of the badly dubbed english voiceover, whilst getting high!)...WATCH THIS definitely!!

btw the ""parkour"" moves are sick! and the main character is the baddy in Die hard 4, can you spot him!!?

,Eddie_Plum,2008-08-14T19:33Z,"Nice torrent, dude.  Quality's awesome (although my laptop can't deal with the frame rate, so it looks a bit jerky)
The Subtitles are well timed, which is always an arse to get right.
I managed to download it quite quickly, too.
All in all, I'm a happy pirate ;-)
