,az5,2006-09-28T13:30Z,"It's from the orginal UK dvd released 2001, I have shrinked it with dvdshrink but other than that it is untouched with extras.

There are no subs on the original dvd, as far as I know there are no subs on any dvd release of this movie."

,aka666joe,2008-02-15T13:48Z,I cant play it with VLC or windvd! Do I do something wrong?
,aka666joe,2008-02-15T13:50Z,Please help! I really love to see this movie!
,virtuality90,2008-04-22T19:35Z,"aka66joe:

I'm going to download this now, and as you see this is a .ISO file (Paris, Texas.ISO).
to play this, you will have to mount it, or burn it on a DVD. ISO is a image file, a virtual DVD on your computer. 

How to play:
1. download daemon tools (www.daemon-tools.cc) - install it - right click the symbol - emulation - all options ON.
2. right click daemon tools icon in the down left corner, choose virtual CD/DVD ROM >  Mount image > Choose the paris, texas ISO file > now your movie is mounted, and can be played in VLC or any other DVD playing program. 

hope this helps, -Virtuality"
