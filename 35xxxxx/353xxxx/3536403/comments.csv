it runs perfect on a 800 mhz 128 ram with windows xp...
and its veeery stable ...
it never crashes. but you have to change the skin.. the orginalskin is so boring...
it has 12 slot sampler and you can use effects(included) on the sound....
you can use it as a jukebox aswell and it will mix the music for you.."
