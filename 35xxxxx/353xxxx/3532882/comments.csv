,Eiht,2006-10-09T08:17Z,Cain and Able is listed in the text above.  It is a useful program if you know what to do with it.  Don't always believe what Norton says.  Norton probably wouldn't like it if I put a copy of LC4 on a machine but if it's there and you know it that's all that matters.  In this case don't try to cry wolf and shut down a useful set of tool just because Norton says so.  Point is if you know it's on here it's not just gonna jump off here and mess stuff up or anything that's why Norton calls it low threat.
