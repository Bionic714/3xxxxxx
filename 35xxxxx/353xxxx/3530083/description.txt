Thanks to Supaturtle...we all now have The Skyhawks Volumes 1-4.


This is the installer & since each successive volume added better panels etc, you will need to do away with the installed rips of volumes 2, 3 & 4....Install this 1 & then move the other files back after you are done.

Volumes 2, 3, & 4 are here...
