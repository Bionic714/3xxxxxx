,bryu27,2008-11-09T20:52Z,Odd aspect ratio.  This should not be in widescreen.  Looks much better in 4:3.  Great rip none the less.  Thanks!

,boltonwonder,2009-10-22T17:30Z,"I downloaded these (and a few other series of your x files) and whilst they all play fine on my laptop - look and sound great, many thanks, when I've burnt them to disk (using DivX) and tried to play them on my ps3, only some of the episodes have sound, not all of them. Anyone any ideas why this might be? Why is it only some episodes have no sound?? Any ideas???
Thanks anyway love this series, love the x files"

,honunet,2010-02-24T22:52Z,"Hey VELHIN, i have enjoyed up to season 4, and look forward to five and the rest you have posted.  excellent quality, you can really tell when hd became prevalent, somewhere in the middle of season 4 the quality skyrocketed to dvd qual.  Dont know if you still monitor this but thanks, brings back great memories"
,MrSucubus,2010-08-21T15:15Z,"Anybody knows if there are romanian subtitles for this torent?

Stie cineva daca sint subtitrari in Romaneste pentru acest torrent?"
,AidyD,2010-09-12T15:38Z,"Ooh awesome widescreen aspect, should start to look better when watching on my 42 tv now, and its been interesting watching the quality improve through each season, should be a nice step up for this season.

Also, the first X Files film is meant to be watched at the end of this series for anyone wanting continuity."
,AidyD,2010-09-12T15:39Z,"Oh just wanted to add - Im not getting audio through PS3 either, on most episodes, tho some I am?

Even tho they are all suppose to be using same audio compression/type?

Hopefully the later seasons will work. "
,chandlerboy,2011-05-27T06:42Z,No audio on PS3. Why?
,gujar302,2011-10-18T23:15Z,Great Work Thanks
