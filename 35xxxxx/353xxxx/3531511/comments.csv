,Sneltrekker,2006-09-30T11:26Z,This is a CloneDVD version that needs a securom hider ... or a release that needs a fixed .exe ... or ... ?
,Ykalon,2006-09-30T14:15Z,For me the game got buggier by installing the patch. It started to get short 1 second freezes constantly and crash to desktop at times. Without the patch it is much more playable for me.
,the_inquisition,2006-09-30T14:51Z,"The patches just make the game crash less than before. It dosen't fix the fundamental flaws of the game itself:

*the engine is so unoptimized that it becomes impossible to play after 10-15 turns, choppy and slow even if you turn everything down to minimum

*AI is barely even implemented! Lots of fun to have the exits to your shops blocked by other buildings etc etc.

*the UI is a disaster.

*Feedback is non-existant. Send one of your robbers out to waylay. If he dies, you get no message. Send him to extort money; you get no message when he is done.

*tons of other bugs;


Such a fucking shame on a great idea. Unplayable and broken. Sell the franchise to Maxis and let them deal with it."
,Mad_troll,2006-09-30T20:37Z,"There is a patch in development due for release in the next month or so, so hang in there! They say it will run normally after applying the patch...who knows, maybe it will =P"
