,rrodger99,2006-10-08T23:06Z,"Many of us already have the isos....any way you could just upload the crack seperately???

Great post."
,bnohifi,2006-10-09T00:41Z,thanks Ras_Putin
,biker9075,2006-10-09T01:48Z,"I am downloading now, once I get it fully downloaded I will post the crack only unless someone gets to it before me :)"
,gavind87,2006-10-09T02:16Z,"anywhere else that I can download this with more seeds . rrodger99 , where did you get yours from"
,biker9075,2006-10-09T02:26Z,"@gavind87, the other FSX download can be found here:

http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3535214/Flightsimulator_X_Deluxe_-_FSX_Delux

Although that one doesn't have the crack included. That one doesn't seem to have any better speeds then this. Its gonna take a day or 2 to download but I think its gonna be worth it. IF you already have the ISO's I will try and get the crack only uploaded on here and will post once done."
,slitex,2006-10-09T02:35Z,"Day or tho? wth are you talking about?
I've downloaded this one in 4 hours.. "
,biker9075,2006-10-09T02:43Z,"@slitex, I am only going about 46kb/s, so its gonna take at least a day."

Thanks Ras_putin"
,Crodge,2006-10-09T03:32Z,It should start to get much faster once more seeds are complete. Probably in the next few days. Thanks for the upload Ras_Putin.
,luke97,2006-10-09T03:36Z,"For the standalone crack, just PM me. I got it from Rapidshare, but (I dont know why) when a post the link here, I get a database error. Anybody knows how to avoid the error? S!"

I was on 99% install when I wrote that it worked, so I confirmed I didnt had any problem with the disks, but when the install arrives to 100% gives an error.

,biker9075,2006-10-09T04:16Z,"Luke97: I have sent you a PM for the crack so I can just download the bluescan release, thanks"
,luke97,2006-10-09T04:42Z,"Sorry rikzter, but I tried to install the game two times and no luck. I hope somebody could upload the repacked DVD1 soon or find a method to avoid/bypass the error."
,rrodger99,2006-10-09T06:22Z,"The re-pack is being uploaded to a.b.games now.

There is a confirmed install issue with dvd1.

Has anyone finished the bluescan dnload to see if it works with the crack?"
,Niedemeyer,2006-10-09T07:52Z,"---
What is the situation status for this torrent?

Is it OK to download this and apply the patch, or do we have to wait and download the repack version?

,rikzter7674,2006-10-09T11:37Z,Can someone confirm if DVD2 works? If it works I can mount Bluescan's DVD1 and then Razor's DVD2 since I'm 20% done with Razor's.

if there is now ISO. files (should be just one for one CD) Ex: ...dvd1, ...dvd2. If u got ....001,002,003 and so u need to extract the files. You do it with winRAR. You just select a file that look like three ""books"" (right click) and choose ""Extract Here"". Then you open Nero burning Rom, (Nero is best) And searh up the ISO.file, should be in your microsoft flight map. Do the same with dvd2 if it's not a ISO file allready. And everything works. You just need a product key to get the FULL game, u can't found it in the Map. So u can only play for a extended time. : / yaya.. pm me if u need more help."

This will unpack with winrar no probs,  open the download, double click on the first packed icon, selct win rar as the programme to open it.... hey presto it unpacks all 80 or so files per disk.  

Dont try using the winrar icon in the downloaded file, it didnt work for me either... like i say just try opening the first packed file.... with win rar..

Installed first time no problem so it cant be that hard, im a fooking moron when it comes to anything complexe on a pc. 

Using the Flight one de-wrappers for fs2004 was more difficult than installing this, and the wrappers were a piece of piss. so it doesnt get any easier really...

I dont know what all the hoo har is about.

,thepikey,2006-10-27T06:26Z,Everyone knows the problem... so heres how you fix it I figured it out. INstall up to the point when it crashes. the alt=ctr=del and cancell the install processes. so you have all the install files. Then downllaod and install the flight sim x demo. Copy the file msxml4.manifest from the demo install to the flight sim x deluxe install. add the razor cracks and there you go one full working version of flight sim x. its just that one file thats messed up. peace Pikey
,rossirep,2006-10-27T18:31Z,"Why dont you post the msxml4.manifest as a torrent so people dont have to download the demo......

Winrar should just unpack it into an ISO file in the specified location...

I unpacked mine to my desktop with no problems using winrar...

However, i didnt use the winrar icon inside disk 2 archive to unpack it as it didnt work.

double click on ""rzr-fsxb 001"" and windows will ask what programme to use to open the file, choose winrar out of the list of programmes and hey presto it unpacks all 80 or so files into one ISO file... honest!  

mine worked flawlessly and boy am i enjoyin FSX now! lol
