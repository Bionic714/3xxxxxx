,g21sf45,2007-10-26T14:32Z,"WTF?!? That first ""IROC Camaro"" mp3 clip..... bastards ripped it off from me on my server. I recorded the whole program from a 2005 Phil Hendrie show and edited that bit, and those dipshits from ebaumsworld stole it off my server and claimed it as their own clip. F*ckin' bastards"
,frequent980,2008-03-18T14:14Z,"Tough shit. You don't own the bit, period."
,revolver24,2008-10-12T19:57Z,"Yeah...  6.99 for only 3 years of Phil.. He refuses to put 2002 2004 2003 up in fulll length, so i say game on!"
