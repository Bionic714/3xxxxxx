,chisa123,2007-12-31T00:06Z,thanks for this.  when i have it i'll seed for a few weeks.
,OOPz,2009-01-03T22:39Z,"the torrent is seeded properly now (my thanks to everyone helping), but i still get a burn request every few months (i guess not everyone has uncapped broadband yet eh :/).

the above offer still valid and unchanged except that my pussified free mail host just closed the 'imaterrorist.com' domain (gutless f##kers eh :/)

new address = logicbomb(at)ikillclowns.com

,Roamer808,2009-08-23T22:27Z,"seeded this for over a month - nobody else uploaded a seed...
