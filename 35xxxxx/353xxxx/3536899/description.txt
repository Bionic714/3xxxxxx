Plot Summary for
\"Doctor Who\" (2005)

Rose Tyler, a young shop assistant in a London department store, 
lives a humdrum and profoundly average life - until the night 
the shop dummies where she works wake up and try to kill her. 
Her life is saved by a strange man who only calls himself 
The Doctor, and intrigued by him, she finds herself thrown 
headlong into a hectic battle to stop an alien presence from 
invading Earth and annihilating the human race. She comes to 
learn that her new friend is even stranger than she thought - 
in fact, the Doctor\'s an alien adventurer called a \'Time Lord\',
 seemingly the last of his race, who travels through time and 
space in his TARDIS battling evil where he finds it. And if 
she travels with him, she\'ll find herself witnessing the 
heat-death of the Earth five billion years in the future, 
meeting Charles Dickens in the past, and encountering lifeforms 
and invaders stranger than she\'d ever thought possible. Only 
one thing is certain - it\'ll be the ride of a lifetime...
