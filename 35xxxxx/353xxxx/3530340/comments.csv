I suck at English but i try at leest.
So if you want to write swedich then go to a swedich webside your idiots. If i want to write in Danish i go to a Danish webside.
So write english or FUCK OFF. Im so fucking tired of all your shity comment's no one understand it and no one will help you if you use that ugly languide. Get on mother fuckers. Get a life or something no one in here want to here you or listing to you. Gays. And by the way, buy your beer in you funking own country. We know that ours if the best but we don't want to look at you. Have a nice life."
