I'm beginning to see the truth in your name."
,fritzjob18,2006-09-30T08:49Z,"http://thepiratebay.org/user/uraphake

I notice you have contributed nothing."
,uraphake,2006-09-30T09:02Z,"Big deal. I have uploaded 6 torrents. All gone now. So what?

Point is -- when I up a torrent, I seed.
Now go fuck yourself or let blowfish101 blow you since you seem to like him so much."
,e4t_a_r00t,2006-09-30T10:21Z,this witty repartee is probably fucking better than this lame ass pr0n torrent.. LOL
,fritzjob18,2006-09-30T16:40Z,"Maybe the guy's computer crashed, maybe he lost his internet connection, any number of things could have happened.  

Point is, you're a jerk.

So, this torrent isn't seeded, so what?  Does it really ruin your life not to be able to download one piece of porn out of the thousands of other pieces of porn available?  If this torrent is not available, move on.

Get a life."
,uraphake,2006-09-30T23:27Z,"I'm a jerk? Yaaaaay!
Okay. Now you've done it. You hurt my feelings.
Mm-hmmm!

People have a right to know when someone is jerking their chain with a torrent not being seeded. Whether you want to believe it or not, there are people on TPB who get their kicks doing that (huntingcheny, watchtv4life). Blowfish101 is one of them."
,fritzjob18,2006-10-01T02:02Z,"Ah, I see.  So what exactly did you mean before when you said you would ""come back when figure out what you're doing?""

So now you are saying that he knows what he's doing, which is jerking you around.

Which is it?  

The people don't need you to protect them.  "
,uraphake,2006-10-01T02:46Z,"Not protecting -- informing.
If I find a torrent with a trojan or virus in it, I would write a comment informing.
Same thing if I find a torrent that's not being seeded, I inform also. If you don't like it, tough shit. No one is forcing you to read my comments but you sure do act like it was a personal attack against you. You must be a blowfish."
,fritzjob18,2006-10-01T02:55Z,"You're right.  The 146 torrents I've uploaded and seeded are all an elaborate plot leading up to this masterful prank of uploading 2 torrents under a different name and not seeding them.  I see now that I was no match for a genius detective such as yourself who saw right through my nefarious scheme.

I think it is much more likely that your first assumption, that blowfish is a newbie who doesn't know what he is doing, is much more likely.  And I think it made you feel important to make snide remarks at the expense of a newbie, and now that someone has pointed out that you're an asshole (not to mention a leech and a troll) that you have adopted this ""hero"" stance, and are trying to prentend that you are doing all this in the public good, patrolling the bittorrent for viruses and unseeded posts.

If you really wanted to make the bittorrent a better place, you would have posted a link like this:

http://www.google.com/search?q=bittorrent+tutorial&sourceid=mozilla-search&start=0&start=0&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&client=firefox&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:unofficial

That would have led this poor newbie to some tutorials that would have helped him figure out how to seed his files, and then we could all be enjoying this and whatever other porn he might have.

But thats not who you are.  I go back to my orignial statement that you're a jerk, and you have reacted to this situation exactly how anyone would expect a jerk to react."
,uraphake,2006-10-01T03:57Z,"As a ""leech"" -- I am proud of my 5 to 1 ratio on every torrent I download. It's the same at Demonoid as well. Leeches don't always fit your restricted worldview. We now know what it is you are proud of. Nice job!
Since you've set yourself up as the monitor of torrent comments here, maybe you should apply for the job of moderator. Oh, wait! They probably want people who actually care about other downloaders and not blowhards. Never mind."
,fritzjob18,2006-10-01T11:56Z,"Thats a bit of the pot calling the kettle black.  If i can steal your logic I'd say that I'm not moderating, I'm informing.  If I saw a virus I'd mention it.  When I see an asshole, I mention that too."
,nutmilk,2006-10-01T20:57Z,"remember focus on the content you find POSITIVE.

and ps you guys stop wasting your time. "
,uraphake,2006-10-01T22:51Z,"Fritzjob18 says: ""When I see an asshole, I mention that too.""

Then you're being redundant -- I already did that.
Let's be frank here: I may be an asshole for deriding some guy for uploading two torrents and not seeding, but you're an equal asshole for turning it into something completely different and unnecessary. I apologize for whatever I've said here to you but I won't apologize for my original comment to blowfish101."
,uraphake,2006-10-02T22:13Z,"XrOo said: ""Sadly, from my point of view you're both idiots :) ""

Yes, we are. :P
It just goes to show that TPB is entertaining even when you're not downloading anything. Heh."
