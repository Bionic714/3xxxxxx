,Luckster,2006-10-12T21:58Z,"Adding the files I have to the swarm , just missing a few myself :)"
,cliokoda,2006-10-12T22:25Z,"I'm aware of the fact that an hour of seeding is not long enough to download 3Gb of data. ;)

I intend to seed long enough so others could take over. At the moment I'm just all alone. :~( 

But I asked my friend to join and he promised me he'll do it tomorow.

So, I'd like to ask for a little patience.

And thank you to share your bandwith with us."

,hentooth,2006-10-15T20:17Z,OMG 52 days to download this... I'll wait untill I can see it on satelite
,sputza,2006-10-16T03:18Z,"Once I'm done downloading, I will see this for one week... maybe even two weeks. This torrent needs some seeds so I will lend some bandwidth."
