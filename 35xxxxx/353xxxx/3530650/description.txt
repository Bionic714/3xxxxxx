Perhaps more reminiscent of Camel circa ?Stationary Traveller? than the Genesis song their name implies, Foxtrot were a mid-80?s Norwegian band headed by ex-Kerrs Pink guitarist Harald Lytomt. Their drummer, Jon-Hakon Skarpsno, would also join Kerrs Pink some thirteen years later. Their only legacy is a largely keyboard-oriented CD released in 1984. While not the most original band around, they do sound far better than most neo-prog bands of that era.

Their only album, ?A Shadow of the Past? (1984) is a mixture of Camel, Pallas, early Marillion, The Alan Parsons Project and Genesis circa ?And Then There Were Three?; it features direct, pleasant, melodious 80?s art rock with excellent vocals, interesting compositions, good musicianship and a fine production. It is a short album made up of six tracks averaging 6 minutes each, among them one memorable mini-epic title track.

Highly recommended. Art rock fans will definitely like this and neo-prog fans may get a hint as to what good neo-prog could sound like. - progarchives.com
