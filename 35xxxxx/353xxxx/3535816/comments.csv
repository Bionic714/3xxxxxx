,gordilloedwin,2009-07-16T10:55Z,"I will try it our, i see 25 seeders, so am assuming it must work regardless of the bad opinions, anyone share the idea? If it works for me i'll come back and post a response"
,dontcomplain-its-all-free,2010-04-26T00:22Z,Works GREAT (for me)! using XP Pro SP3 32bit. Unrar and run STARTCD. Don't know what else to add.. wasn't magic.. Suggest a good Computing 101 book for those who can't seem to get anywhere on this one.
,DragonRider65,2011-04-27T09:19Z,"This is badass! I have never seen this formta before, where the heck did you get this? I had to right-click and run as Administrator, and the format opened for me and you can even view in a Video Mode! That is too cool! I am impressed! I know Inventor very well, I have a Degree in Computer Drafting & Design, but I love tutorials so I checked this out! I will help seed for as long as I can, and I thank you for this upload!

@coldgamer: Dude, the interface for 2010 changed dramatically between the 2010 and the 2009 versions. Download one of the newer versions from here and install that instead. Trust me; ALL of the 2010 versions of ALL of the Autodesk software have changed their interface to the ""MIcrosoft Ribbon"" format. You will see what I mean if you look at the 2007+ versions of MIcrosoft Office and then compare the top of the screen to those applications. Leanr the new version, the old ones will just throw you off. I started learning AutoCAD and all of those back in 2008 and then they switched up on me in mid-stream! It is fucked, I know, but you have to go with the flow man. If Autodesk changes, man, you got to learn the new version, that is all there is to it! Good luck!"
,SummondSkull,2011-08-22T20:56Z,"Steps for running these video tutorials for Windows XP:
1. Unrar these compressed files.
2. Make a virtual CD from the resulting files by using PowerISO.
3. Put this Image file by using PowerISO or any Virtual CD Softwares.
4. CD will run WELL.

Hint: - You can find PowerISO in this URL:
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6566450/PowerISO_v4.8___Serials_%5BChattChitto_RG%5D
        - Make Virtual CD by using PowerISO:
          I. Open program from its main icon.
         II. Put selected files inside the main window (Drag and Drop).
        III. Save the file an *.iso, *.daa, or *.bin."
