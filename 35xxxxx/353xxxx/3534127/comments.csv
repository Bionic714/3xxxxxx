,Darkewolfe,2008-01-05T15:52Z,"To install Java games to a Moto V3x, connect to PC then copy the jar files to the kjava folder on the memory card. Then open java apps, switch devices then install games from card to phone."
,firepyro090,2008-01-06T07:42Z,"It downloaded fine, but when i put them all on my phone, they just wont work. If anybody can help me please. I have a LG CU500"

,Mr.Lackas,2008-03-01T15:19Z,"I hope The will work on my w610i (a) but ty pal for upload the games 

(fun on the bus)"
,Michael-M,2008-04-26T01:44Z,"Spank, I ain't tryin' to bite your shit and stuff, but if you decide not to list the contents, you could at least upload the files as they are (without zipping them altogether). Most games in the zip file are most probably included in other torrents, so it wouldn't be worth it to download 20 megs just to end up with two or three new games."
,m1k392,2008-05-20T04:48Z,"Do these work on a Nokia 6288? It comes up with ""file not supported"" any chance of sum 1 posting a guide?"
,jimbojetuk,2008-05-23T23:11Z,"Sony Ericsson:

1) Copy files to OTHER folder in phone
2) Use phone, go to OTHER and install files to games folder
3) Play"
