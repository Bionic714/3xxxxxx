,balls107,2006-11-25T13:00Z,"It'll be a .cue and .bin file chap. Get yourself a toy called Daemontools to create a virtual drive. You can ""mount"" image files (which is what .bin & .cue are) in daemontools to make your compy think it's good wholesome discness. When it's been mounted, it'll appear in your ""My Computer"" like a normal disc. Alternatively, use burning software (nero, alcohol 120) to burn the image file to a cd then just stick it in your pc and it'll act like the original disc."
