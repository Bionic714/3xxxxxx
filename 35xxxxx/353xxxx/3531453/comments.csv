,007ace,2006-10-03T15:13Z,"I dont think so, but ive only used it on an english system so im not 100% sure.

more than likely... no"
,007ace,2007-12-19T22:30Z,Crazy i cant believe this torrent is still alive after a whole year
,Crazytown2008,2008-05-03T03:40Z,This is a great torrent downloaded with no problems!!! Thanks 007ace
,bdme00,2008-06-04T00:04Z,Seed? It is downloading VERY slow. Thanks.
,sim8079,2008-07-30T19:17Z,Hi - is this the UK version?
,bm_mad,2008-09-16T09:27Z,"great torrent....can't get past the 'sign in to open your money file' though. It won't recognise my .net password, is there a way to get past this screen?
Apparently the .net passwrod option should show during installation, but it doesn't."
,skaze,2008-10-26T00:43Z,i've got the same problem as bm_mad. anyone got any ideas how to get this running?
,007ace,2009-03-25T04:26Z,"hmm... odd, ive yet to run into this problem. all i can reccomend is the typical windows thing, restart, reinstall, retry.
maybe the .net server is having issues with 4 year old money software... ill look around and see if i can get a better answer"
