it is supposed to be for 6.1.4 or something but works on 7.1.9"
,paralittic,2006-10-13T05:13Z,"scratch that, if u use that key it claims that u registered but if u try to do anything that requires regestration ittl ask u to enter the key again, if you do that then the same thing happens again and again"
