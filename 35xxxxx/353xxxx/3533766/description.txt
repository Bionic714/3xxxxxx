\'Chapter-by-chapter, John Rose scrutinises the roots of the myths of Zionism. He separates fact from fiction presenting a detailed historiography of their origins and development. This includes an examination of biblical archeology, as well as a detailed exploration of Judaism\'s links to this particular region of the Middle East. He shows clearly that Zionism makes many false claims on Jewish religion and history. He questions its rationale as a response to European anti-Semitism, and shows that, if there is ever to be peace and reconciliation in the land of Palestine, this intellectual dishonesty must be addressed.\'

\"written in an accessible way, despite the very complicated issues with which Rose deals-- such as the cultural and ideological sources of the Zionist narrative\"

A very small chunk is missing from p14-15 about Israel Eldad\'s criticisms of Ben Gurion\'s assertions on the Torah and Jewish diaspora (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Eldad)
