,whomonkey,2007-01-07T07:46Z,"Ever hear of Ultramega U.K?
Ever hear of Louder Than Love?
Ever hear of the Loudest Love import with the cover of ""Come Together"" (that would be the Beatles just in case you haven't heard) and Heretic from the soundtrack of ""Pump up the Volume"" (you know - trhe movie with that Jack Nickolson wanna-be guy named Christian Slater?) Well at least your torrent works. Although I Thank You Sincerely for the download - some people just need to know that the Loud Love era was what was Seattle. Ever hear of Mother Love Bone?, Green River?, oh no that's Pearl Jam now - MudHoney? Pixies?"
