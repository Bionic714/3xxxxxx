Three Danish classics produced between 1975 and 1977 on one disc. A must-buy for fans of good old film grain, lush beaver pelts and nudie musical sequences. A trio of exemplary Scandinavian smut movies: BELLES DAMES DU TEMPS JADIS is an aristocratic costume drama, LA FOIRE ... drops the viewer in the ring of an orgasmic circus show, and LES LECONS ... is another retro-effort with lots of costumes, frivolous dancing, wholesome fucking and an auto-fellatio stunt that would put Ron Jeremy to shame! Expect some mild anal shenanigans as well.
