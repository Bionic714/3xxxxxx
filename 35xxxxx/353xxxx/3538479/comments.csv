,mrdunworthy,2006-10-12T23:56Z,Hate to sound stoopid but what exactly is it? An application for recording audiotapes --> PC (i.e. MP3)? Or am I way off the mark? as usual.

Some link to where the program was found could be nice."
,marwan63,2006-10-13T17:00Z,I think he mean tape but what does it mean
,mrdunworthy,2006-10-14T19:51Z,"OK, I may have found it. Torrent includes: ""PC Cassette Studio.exe"" and ""Orchestra.exe"" which leads us to:

And since traditional Torrents do not hash hardware, it's most likely the software. But can that be used without the actual hardware?"
