,analu,2011-05-31T22:29Z,"thank u so much VELHINHOCEGO for the x-files seasons uploads! 

obrigada pelo excelente trabalho! \m/^__^

gravei as temporadas todas da TV em VHS durante os anos 90 e fiquei sempre triste por a qualidade de imagem e som de muitos eps ser pĂŠssima - agora, estou a adorar deitar fora as VHS e rever tudo com versĂŁo rip de alta qualidade! 

Obrigada!

The X-Files = Best TV series EVER!
VELHINHOCEGO = Best X-Files uploader ever! ^__^"
