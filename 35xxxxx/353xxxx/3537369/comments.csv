,freddym3rc,2006-10-17T00:24Z,Excellent documentary on this American cult.
,37sammills,2006-10-18T07:08Z,"Shocking documentary of a ""cult-like"" for-profit organization descended from werner erhard's est training, (erhard seminars training) and werner erhard and associates."
,goodguy9069,2006-10-19T01:02Z,"Why does it say ""End Part 1"" at the end of this video?  Is there another part coming? 
Anyway, very interesting and thanks for the upload!"
,37sammills,2006-10-19T09:11Z,"I believe there is some more to the video, perhaps at least another 30min, but probably not coming at this point.  btw, werner erhard's brother harry rosenberg is ceo of the current company, sister joan rosenberg is on the board, and personal attorny art schreiber is general counsel and chairman of the board.  all of the above had prominent roles in the Est training and in werner erhard and associates."

EFF discusses Landmark Education's misuse of the DMCA subpoena"
,kyrkbymannen,2006-11-26T19:12Z,"Den där sekten är grymt destruktiv. En bekant till mig var fast där i över ett år. Fortfarande nu efter att dom lagt ner titelerar han sig som coach och guru, samt verkar helt inne i snacket.... genombrott... osv... alla dom där uttrycken som sekten planterat in som triggers.

Jag fattar inte att just han fastnade i den, han har varit egenföretagare och en rätt så stark person, nu styrs han av sekten, trots att dom lagt ner kontoret i stockholm för flera år sedan. Det verkar som det bitit sig fast på något sätt. 

Mig har han ingen kontakt med i princip, jag är itne längre intressant antar jag eftersom jag inte varit med i sekten och blivit ""upplyst"" som han och hans närmaste. Glad är jag för det, jag vill vara den jag är , inte en person som någon annan vill att jag ska vara.

Skitsekt.. borde vara olagligt!"
,kenmarton,2006-12-08T22:19Z,"This ""documentary"" is a disgrace.  It vilifies a fine educational organization, Landmark Education, whose effectiveness and utility in people's lives have been confirmed by studies done at both Harvard and USC.  This video employs a variety of emotive-manipulative techniques to influence the viewer's thoughts and feelings (ominous music, targets painted on people's faces, etc.), which act to inhibit rather than support critical thought.  It is ironic that the video attacks Landmark for ""brainwashing"", when in fact the video employs the kinds of techniques that are more akin to brainwashing.  I have a Ph.D. in the neurosciences from a major university, have enjoyed a great deal of benefit from Landmark programs, and find this video appalling.   The most appaling aspect of it is that its producers seem so willing to damage an organization that has brought so much benefit to so many people."
,37sammills,2006-12-08T23:04Z,"The producers of the Pieces a Conviction or ""Exhibits"" program are very highly regarded.  

They were featured speakers at the ""Conference on Investigative Journalism"" in October 2006.  At the conference they actually specifically addressed using hidden cameras as a useful tactic in investigative journalism.  

They have received paraice from Time Magazine, the International Herald Tribune, and 60 Minutes.  

In 2003, they received a prize for the investigation into the Frigates of Taiwan.  In 2005, they received the FIGRA award for their investigation into convicted killer Patrice Alegre.  In 2006, they received both the Albert-Londres prize and the Dauphine-Henri Tézenas of Montcel prize.

The ""ominous music, targets painted on people's face"" as you put it, are common sound and graphic design editing styles used by the program in many of their other episodes as well.

One only has to search Google ""Landmark Education cult"" to see a very different history than the one portrayed by the company itself..."
,37sammills,2007-05-08T10:06Z,"For those reading the comments - simply respect the fact that the producers of the documentary have received acknowledgement of their previous work from Time Magazine, the International Herald Tribune, and 60 Minutes - received a 2003 prize for the investigation into the Frigates of Taiwan, 2005, FIGRA award for their investigation into convicted killer Patrice Alegre, 2006, Albert-Londres prize and the Dauphine-Henri Tézenas of Montcel prize - lectured other investigative journalists at ""Conference on Investigative Journalism"" in October 2006.

Or just judge for yourself."
,kyrkbymannen,2007-08-22T20:12Z,"37Sammils, as you can see, some of the comments above are from members of the organisation... they are too brainwashed, thats why they try to defend something that has been proved to be destructive in serveral tv infiltrations."
,37sammills,2007-08-23T19:14Z,"Most likely, yup."
,Black_Rage,2008-01-28T18:22Z,"Those silly French, I'm a landmark grad, I did the Forum, the Advanced course, and a number of seminars, and I can tell anybody who wants to listen, landmark ain't a CULT, and not to forget, the French don't like anything that doesn't originate in France, except maybe for Jerry Lewis who they consider a comic genius, there is an old saying, "" just because you don't understand it, doesn't mean it doesn't make sense"" or better said "" go see for your self"" and make up your own mind ;-)  "
,37sammills,2008-02-02T00:09Z,"You do not have to try cocaine yourself in order to judge for yourself if it is good or bad for you.

Do the research, read the studies, read the investigations by the United States Federal Department of Labor, check out the resources on the Internet.

And make up your own mind."
,freddym3rc,2008-05-22T16:11Z,"Here's a fresh set of 4 videos: Lars Bergwik on Landmark Education. In his own words:

""I am introducing an antidote to the landmark virus of the mind. Landmark Education Corporation uses very powerful mind control/thought reform methods to implement a \""technology\"" into unsuspecting participants. I have been there - I was an introduction leader to the forum for 2 years. I was totally into landmark - it was my life...now I have turned into a very disgruntled ex member of the \""educational cult\"" LEC.""

,the_epoch,2010-04-04T01:35Z,"It's a shame this is missing the second part!

Whilst the style is very sensationalist, it's otherwise an informative look inside the Landmark education system."
,chamouf,2011-01-24T11:09Z,"I am in the SELP course right now. During the Advanced Course I changed my life. My ""act"" was this: IT'S EITHER YOU OR ME!!!! I had a competition going on with everyone in the world. ALL 7 BILLION!!! and I was stressed. I couldn't be in relationships, friendships, or ever let anyone get close to me. I am so thankful that I got my act...I was ready to leave my ""friend"" in Costa Rica over $17 because I had this ""me against you"" attitude. Bash it all you want. I now have a great relationship with my friends and mom because of landmark. Maybe they do brainwash...but maybe we need some brainwashing from all the crap we've made up in our lives and lived around :)"
