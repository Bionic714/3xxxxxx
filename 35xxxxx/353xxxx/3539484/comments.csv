This is an encyclopedic reference of editions of their Watchtower magazine for them to look up old articles when relevant to current topics.

I know many Jehovahs Witnesses and they will gladly share information about their faith with anyone who asks."
,belfastconfetti,2007-10-28T21:54Z,Not everything  - if anyone felt like putting up a copy of the Watchtowers hebrew and greek bibles then I'd be more interested and less suspicious.
,cybernero,2007-12-31T19:56Z,"HAHA!Not going to download this unless i want to show some JW friends of mine (i was a JW some time ago) the false prophecies...
Get a life,get a girl,Download some action games and movies and forget this shit!
If you want something strong to read get some Socrates or Plato books!They will surely help.
The only thing it will do is melt your brain!!!
(BTW Pirate Bay is a Sharing Network and not just ""pirate"".JWs wont allow their ppl to share information with ppl out of their cult...)"
,EMAILMEN0W,2008-01-30T00:10Z,"I know many Jehovah's Witnesses.  Yes they do share information with people outside their organization (it's by no means a cult!)  Umm, they go and preach their message at houses all the time, and any time I've asked a question, they thoroughly explained it, using the bible too, not just saying ""I think....""  And they have a site with a lot of their stuff on it, watchtower.org, so they obviously share their knowledge.  I'm convinced they have the true, and I think I will be one when I'm older"
,willy_smalls,2008-05-03T12:51Z,As a former witness I recommend that anyone interested do a little research before joining this cult.  What you see publicly does not jive with the passive mind control within the organization.  Read or DL the book Crisis of Conscience.  The NWT (New World Translation) is a modified Bible edited to support witness doctrine.  Read up!
,Mckye,2008-05-29T05:50Z,"FYI, the NWT has been voted many times over the 'most literal bible translation' using modern English, and as such, would not likely have been ""modified to support witness doctrine"".  Maybe you are the one who should ""read up""."
,NeoPirateX,2008-06-21T09:44Z,"You will find that it is their own ""NWT"" not the one you are on about......the fact that the WTBTS is a ""glorified book Company"" you might want to start digging abit deeper, and your friends would gladly share information with you as they want you to join. Been there, done that got the t-shirt!!!"
,thewindowisthedoor,2009-12-25T21:03Z,"The only thing modified about the NWT is that God's name, Jehovah, has been put back into the Bible, where it should be.  It's a great translation, easy to understand, and isn't made to fit JW doctrine at all.  "
,dusty122,2010-04-13T00:48Z,"man it is funny to read some of the comments 
the only reason ppl right these things are because they were one and then because of falling out of the TRUTH they then got mad and then started to rant about JWs and trust me, they are NOT cults because if they were they wouldnt be preaching from door to door. like CYBERNERO comment he was once one. he most likely did something wrong that the bible forbids and then he either left of fell out. and then he got mad and started to hate them. look up in some older versions of the bible and see if it says in the begining that they took out the name JEHOVAH. 

and somthing else that ppl should know is that JWs dont celebrate holidays like XMAS because all of it is pagan. Jesus was not born in December. the 3 WISE men were actualy astrologers that king Herod sent. and if u know wat king herod was like then u would know who sent the star. and the reason y ppl hate JWs is because they know that its the truth and because the JW are all over the earth and in the bible says that it would be spread over the earth and then the end would come. 
Mathew 24 :14 if u dont believe me and wat other religion besides Mormons that want your money preach from door to door and thats all over the earth. please i recommend talking to them as i am one. and we are not a cult. and people that write things like that are because they were one and they fell out. 

and all the stuff that you here are not from JWs its from the bible. please if you meet one ask them to give you the book""what does the bible really teach"" its ALL from the bible not from men. 

plz i recomend 
peace and love from canada        "
,pervert66,2010-12-12T07:55Z,"It makes me sick to see how easily ppl are manipulated by religion (and yes, esp JWs). You don't even realize that you have NO control over your life (ask the elders if its ok if you check out another religion on your own, read another religion's materials, associate with someone socially OUTSIDE of the JWs, express an adverse opinion during the watchtower study, question an elder, stand up to them and say no to something... etc). I pity you because it is clear you have no fucking idea what you are involved in. 

nuff said."
