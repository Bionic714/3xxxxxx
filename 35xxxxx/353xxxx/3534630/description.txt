I - Games Description:

Midtown Madness 2:

"Midtown Madness 2 delivers even more mad-cap racing excitement with all the wild and hair-raising racing challenges
you've come to expect! Midtown Madness 2 features two great locations (London & San Francisco) and 9 hip urban road
machines!"

"Midtown Madness 2 features the single-player Crash Course mission mode where budding drivers master the tricks of
Madness racing as a Hollywood Stunt Driver on location at a San Francisco movie set or as a Cabbie Trainee at the East
End Cab Company School of Driving in London!"

Motocross Madness 2:

"Motocross Madness 2 is the outrageous sequel to the award winning Motocross Madness. Motocross Madness 2 features all of
the killer dirtbike action of the original, but takes a quantum leap forward with entirely new gameplay depth, graphics
realism, accessibility and community/multiplayer features."

"Motocross Madness 2 lets you put your skills to the test racing to win and competing like the pros. Along with all new
event modes (like Enduro) Motocross Madness 2 features an entirely new mode of gameplay -- Pro Circuit career
mode -- where you start out as a rookie "privateer" competing against a field of tough AI competitors. Your goal: prize
money, sponsorship dollars and career win points. Your ultimate goal -- reach the pro Supercross circuit... and
Supercross Super Stud-dom.
Motocross Madness 2 features an upgraded physics engine that allows independent rider and biker motion, variable surface
friction (slick ice, gravel, mud) and a range of bike handling and performance options. We've also added incredible new
graphics for eye-popping terrain (4 times as large as the terrain in the original) populated with 3-D objects and a
variety of vehicles and characters. Throw in licensed motorcycles, gear, and a create-your-own custom rider and bike
feature -- and you've got one BOSS racing experience."
