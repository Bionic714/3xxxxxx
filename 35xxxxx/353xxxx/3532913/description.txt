Windows XP JACKED_reatta32 is a replica of the version of Windows XP Professional that I run and includes the 11 main programs that I use.  

9 of 11 programs are installed automatically and unattendedly during Windows XP?s normal setup (the other 2 will be on the desktop, waiting for you to install them).



Why is this OS so much bigger than the other Windows XP JACKED editions?

Office 2007 Professional Plus Beta 2 is included in this OS.  The setup file for the program is 450MB.



How much RAM does JACKED_reatta32 use under optimum conditions--no services or programs running?

18.46MB.  Need proof?  Check out this print screen shot (don't forget to subtract the task manager from the RAM usage).
