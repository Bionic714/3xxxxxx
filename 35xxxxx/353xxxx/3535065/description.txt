It is what it is.

The wife got hooked on this cheesey Australian soap opera, but the cable network here in the states stopped airing it after 3 seasons.  So I've been sent hither and yon through the bowels of teh Interwebs to get her fix.  

Most have been easy, but Season Six (the currently airing season) has been a bitch.  This episode has been so difficult to find that I thought it worth putting up in Torrent format for the other poor souls out there who need this to keep the peace in their homes.

(If anyone has Episode 6 of Season 6, it would be greatly appreciated if you could make it available.)
