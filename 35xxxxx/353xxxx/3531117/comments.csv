,netslaveone,2006-09-30T12:50Z,is there a way i can let people download faster...?  i ony have dm seeding and the speeds are really slow...
,EXAR_KUN,2006-09-30T15:16Z,try to upgrade your transfer rate ;) and let's see what happens
,netslaveone,2006-09-30T15:56Z,upload/download speeds are at unlimited.  would initial seeding help this situation??
,EXAR_KUN,2006-09-30T22:12Z,"could be, seems your conectivity is very limited  ......now the % is at 21.6 ;) we have to be patience ;)"
