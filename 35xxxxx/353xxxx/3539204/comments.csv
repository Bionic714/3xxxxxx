,Schwein,2006-12-15T22:18Z,Thanks. Hope it works. :)
,Schwein,2006-12-23T14:08Z,"Seems like it doesn't. On the first installation attempt it got stuck and I ended the process. On every new try it says there's not enough room on the drive. Unless it really requires 3,97 GB, that's bull."
,Schwein,2006-12-23T14:15Z,"NM, installation seems to work now. Instead of running the downloaded torrent again, one has to go into program files and the xbox360 folder and run the setup.exe from there.
However, the installation got stuck again. :("
,Schwein,2006-12-23T14:24Z,"Allright, one final comment now. I received a failure message again a few minutes into setup, but the controller still began to work just fine. :)
Thanks a lot for the software."
