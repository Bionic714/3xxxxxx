,joeypesci,2007-02-27T19:57Z,"ISO didn't burn.  Mounted it and as always with these EA games recently the directx install part failed, meaning you can't install it.

Work around is to download Directx from MS.  Unpack the .iso using Magic ISO.  Then copy the Directx into the directory where you unpacked the .iso"
,joeypesci,2007-02-27T20:01Z,"This input box is screwed up in FireFox.
So I was saying.  Once you copy the directx over, the install will now work.

To the other poster.  Explore the .iso and there is a crack directory.  Once the game has installed copy the nbalive07.exe over to the directory where the original is.  Play the game."
