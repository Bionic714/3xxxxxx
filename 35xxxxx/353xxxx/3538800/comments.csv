Nothing happens when i doubbleklick on it.

However it's a very nice antivirus software that dosent doubble the computer start time like Norton and Panda.
So I bought it online at http://www.bitdefender.com/."

,abobo1,2006-10-27T10:39Z,"KEYGEN PATCHED ON OCT-24-2006!

WITH THE RECENT UPDATE ON BUILD 108 on OCT-25-2006, ALL KEYGENS AND FAKE KEYS HAVE BEEN FUCKEN PATCHED!!!!

Waiting on HACKERS to make a new keygen or if u got keys POST THEM ASAP!!!

If you use a v9 key it will last about 3 days, I've been cycling v9 keys to keep it going so I have an AV. 

If someone has KEYGEN POST OR SEED FOR FUCK SAKE, dont be a JEWDEFENDER v10"

,la_cross37,2009-11-29T16:23Z,I recommend that you download the bitdefender trial at http://www.bitdefender.com/. the best bitdefender product is total security so i recommend you to download that one. after you have downloaded and installed the trial download this torrent http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5106765/BitDefender_2010_All_Products_Patch_v3.0A_(BOX_)_[RH] and apply it. you will have a fully working bitdefender 2010 to the year 2047. enjoy! if you need more help and information there will be plenty of it in the readme file in the torrent.
