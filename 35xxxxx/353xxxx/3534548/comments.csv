,Merihim,2006-10-06T11:26Z,"Damn I just got apm from a female cast member and she said ""you bitches should seed motherfuckas"" figure it out?! i dont give a a shit but if you guys dont SEED...! "
,extrudedplasticdingus,2006-10-06T16:19Z,"Weird.  I don't have HBO but I thought they were only on episode 5?  Is this really #9?  If so, where are 6, 7, 8?

I don't want to DL until I've seen those because I'm afraid I'll watch it."
,extrudedplasticdingus,2006-10-06T17:33Z,nevermind...I didn't read your description
,kant69,2006-10-06T18:18Z,"Fantastic, and thanks;

I can't wait until the rest of us are sent - or can get - the message.

When can we expect the entire season, and will it be individual episodes or the entire season all at once?

thanks again"
,Merihim,2006-10-06T21:59Z,soon Kant we are trying anyone can correct this if they want im pretty sure its episode 9...god im so fuckin hungover today but dont worry we are working it out to have those gaps filled! In the meantime support the Pirate Bay with a small donation...
,kant69,2006-10-06T22:41Z,"thanks Merihim - will do.

In the meantime, please release the episodes in the correct order or with the correct numbers - otherwise, your act of kindness or generosity will end up being mean or cruel!"
,Merihim,2006-10-06T23:03Z,"Ok an ongoing confusion I HAVENT EVEN WATCHED THIS EPISODE YET but my bro swears it's episode 7 but after reading the writeup spolers im convinced it's 9 feel free to correct me and if im wrong i'll contact admin and see if we can change it! in the meantime seed your damn torrents people!

here's the unofficial spoiler thread

,kant69,2006-10-06T23:30Z,"Um, you might want to watch the episodes before you release them under any given description - otherwise you'll only manage to piss people off, despite all your hard word. The show is like a novel with chapters - each builds on (and presupposes) the other chapters. Releasing them in the wrong order or under mistaken descriptions will only prove to be unwelcome and counterproductive."
,Shiftguru,2006-10-06T23:44Z,"I must say im chocked! Damn nice to have you the CRX team or who ever is getting the episodes getting them. And i will download it and seed lika muthafaka :D but i wont watch it since its lke kant69 says, the series is best when you follow it from the start, and ive seen all episodes so ill wait. but ill also seed for long. Peace (btw feel free to register to www.thuggish.biz)"
,Shiftguru,2006-10-06T23:45Z,"and by the way, great seeders! took me 6 minutes to get it down. And ill seed aswell. Peace"
,Merihim,2006-10-06T23:55Z,"Great job seeding people! and ill up another soon
 Now we need to properly
ident this episode my bros saying seven
im convinced it's nine! Also when a wire torrent
pops up new you better damn well seed that shit
or i'll boot you off top seeders get it first and
trust me im watchin like a hawk!"
,Merihim,2006-10-07T00:06Z,"Believe me Kant im getting a ton of shit for this
Im a young gun who went outside the accepted
release rules. This is why we have veterans i
have a Lester Freeman dude all over my ass for this damn torrent BTW so im being punished and 
dragged through the mud by others! Like i said noone is forcing you to watch it. Besides im the dude who's gonna get thrown from the Cliff not you!"
,Shiftguru,2006-10-07T00:10Z,"Thanks for posting Merihim, appreciating it =)"
,Merihim,2006-10-07T00:24Z,"Your welcome!
Im being told this is EPISODE 7
still not 100% sure on that i had a window
of oppurtunity last night so excuse if i labelled it
wrong! Any Wire freaks are welcome to Chime in
and positively ident this episode. Im doing the
best i can. If when we are all 100% i try to
contact admin and change the torrent name"
,Shiftguru,2006-10-07T02:42Z,Does not look like episode 7 since *cough* that guy in the beginging *cough* havent been caught yet. period. =)
,duderofthenight,2006-10-07T03:09Z,"""Does not look like episode 7 since *cough* that guy in the beginging *cough* havent been caught yet. period. =)"" 

Yeah, but at the same time episode 6 obviously isn't out there either, and if you watched five it was definitely building to this...
Plus I just watched the whole thing, couldn't resist, and it matches up with the spoiler for ep 7 on the link posted earlier.
Thanks for the awesome up! And yeah, you prolly shouldn't watch it if you don't like being spoiled..."
,Merihim,2006-10-07T03:22Z,"Correction: im finally getting around to watching it and it is Season 4 episode 7
http://www.tv.com/the-wire/unto-others/episode/744493/summary.html?tag=ep_list;title;5"
,kant69,2006-10-07T07:14Z,"Woo hoo!

please please pretty please bring on the rest of the season - preferrably as one single torrent if possible!"
,Merihim,2006-10-08T01:07Z,You guys can do whatever you want! If when all the files are upped and someone wants to repackage them into 1 full torrent GREAT in the meantime i can only do single episodes. If Crimson catches up and they covered the watermark great to go with those instead so far ive only seen episode 5 and we are also missing six. The next upload would be 9 not the one i mislabeled here which is actually seven. confused yet?
,kant69,2006-10-08T07:54Z,"Merihim, just out of curoisity (and to feel less confused): how is it that you're missing episode 6? and are there other episodes you're missing?

keep up the good work, of course - but please let us know what (and when) you can manage."
,anirog,2006-10-10T09:15Z,"""""Does not look like episode 7 since *cough* that guy in the beginging *cough* havent been caught yet. period. =)""

He's right this aint episode 6"
,duderofthenight,2006-10-10T21:17Z,^ I guess you're half right
,DrMalatov,2006-10-11T15:53Z,yo i'm trying to download this torrent but it has 0 seeders
