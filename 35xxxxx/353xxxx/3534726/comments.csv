,Darkarbiter,2007-09-10T03:15Z,"Learn what techno is dickhead. This is not techno. Techno has heavy base and often it's not very subtle and obvious.

All electronic genres fall under the term ""Electronica"" techno is a very specefic term. 

I haven't heard this yet but in general Juno Reactor is Goa Trance/Modern classical (NOTHING LIKE TECHNO)"
