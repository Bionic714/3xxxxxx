Great RPG crippled by bugs at release.  Fixed by the gaming community.  This version includes all the patches (official & unoffical) as well as the widescreen resolution patcher.  This patcher is included in the "Bin" folder, a file called "vtmbrespatcher.exe".  This will allow you to patch the game to run at your LCD's native widescreen resolution.  Anyway, enjoy!  DAMN Activision for making them release this early.  It could have been the mother of all RPG's!!!!!
