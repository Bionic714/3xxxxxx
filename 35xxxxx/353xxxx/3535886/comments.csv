,Cedaar,2006-10-08T19:12Z,"cracked and fixed?

Or do i need to DL some other files to get it to work?

Anyway.... sounds like a really good game.

Thx for upload, will seed until i got atleast 3 complete uploads."
,vpbpi,2006-10-08T19:14Z,"Cracked, no CD/DVD needed.  All updates make the game playable and finishable.  Very good game, but could've been great."
,vpbpi,2006-10-08T19:15Z,"Sorry for double-posting, I forgot to mention that you need nothing else to play this and finish it.  I wasn't sure if I made that clear in the last post."
,AssMaster,2006-10-08T19:21Z,"Yeah, this is a fucking sweet game, I've played it through 3 times since it was released, and I'm thinking of giving it another try. But as mentioned, it's really bug-ridden. it's one of my favourite games, all times anyway!"
,bush whacker,2006-10-09T23:02Z,"for some reason it crashes on my computer, even before it starts the game. I bought to original and it was so buggy that in a rage i destroyed it. really would like to try this improved version"
,vpbpi,2006-10-10T02:36Z,"Hey Bush wacker. Did you run the resoution patcher in the bin folder? It is set to widescreen, if your card or monitor don't support that resolution then that may be the problem.  I think the default resolution is 800x600.  I think this install is set for 1440x900 because that is the native resolution of my LCD."
,bush whacker,2006-10-10T11:46Z,thanks man working now
,vpbpi,2006-10-10T15:59Z,No problem.  Hope you like it.  I know I did.
,wolfbane,2006-10-11T20:57Z,"If you want the most fun, play as malkavian"
,kaisercs,2006-10-17T22:30Z,"I need some help. Every time I try running the file ""bloodlines_install"" it just locks up. Is there something i'm not doing right?"
,vpbpi,2006-10-18T02:46Z,This is the first time that I've heard anyone say that they have had problems installing.  What OS are you running?
,vpbpi,2006-10-18T02:47Z,"Just for everyone's info, there is a new unofficial patch that has not been included in this installation package.  It will not affect gameplay and only fixes some minor bugs, if you would like to download it, it can be found at http://www.worthdownloading.com/download.php?gid=196&id=8906"
,kaisercs,2006-10-18T20:41Z,Nevermind about my issue. When I would run the installer it would take about 3+ minutes to actually load up. I got it installed correctly and it seems to be running fine. 
,Senso,2006-10-28T19:13Z,"The game keeps crashing right when I start it, even after testing a few resolutions with the pach. Any idea? I get a dump log file but it doesn't say much."
,vpbpi,2006-10-31T06:39Z,Have you tried 800x600 for a resolution?  That is the original default resolution.  This version is set to 1440x900 by default.
,crazyfist_87,2006-10-31T14:24Z,started playing this game about 10 months ago and loved it! but unfortunatley I never finished it cuz of all the bugs n' shit.. if the decription of this torrent is true you have made me a very happy man.. :D
,Detect80,2006-10-31T22:14Z,I have the same problem as Senso but my game crashes after you create a character. Ive tried all 3 defult settings. Ive tried 800x600 but in that patcher there are so many spaces to type in the resolution/size I dont exacly know how to work it. help?
