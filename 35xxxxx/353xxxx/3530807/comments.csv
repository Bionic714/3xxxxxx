,One4ty,2006-09-30T14:48Z,"Axxo steals some of the films... for example from Diamond... and he gets all the creds, thats wrong..... =("

,foxxme,2006-10-01T12:04Z,No subs??
,dongle,2006-10-01T17:31Z,"Shabazia; you must have a problem with your downloader program try a new version, im assuming your using bitcomet, because i know when i was using that program it renamed my files with a ending suffix .bc and sometimes when it had finished downloading the files didn't get changed.

just single clik on the files and rename them by deleting the end of the file. ****.rar.bc remove the .bc and the file should be recognised by winrar. or look at the options/prefrences in your program perhaps theres a simple problem with your settings there.

hope this helps"

,mixim,2006-10-08T05:12Z,"For those of you still defending axxo,are you guys death?
112 kb/s CBR MP3  is like 1998!!! or even worse... The sound on axxo-releases is like hearing through a thick wall of earwax... Explosions sound like farts, and so on... aXXo is a fucking fony, joker and shitty asshole for putting stuff like that out there... I'll never download his shit, because it's per defenition, shit...

Go all other releasegroups! Like FEAR !"
,mixim,2006-10-09T23:35Z,"shp0ngle. Get a life;) Spellchecking on the net? hehe. Doesn't change the fact that aXXo is a dipshit using the fact that people some people can't hear. What a shame, for good releases like theese to go a bit wasted!"

,Zygi-PL,2006-10-27T13:20Z,"Seyss: warez scene is very traditional or i could say they obey scene rules (not all though), thats why they use old (compatible) versions most of the time, but thats not explain why for example they use old version of LAME (3.90) when new recommended one is 3.97 (by Hydrogen Audio forum - read LAME developer and lot of people with very good ears doing blind listening tests). Here is a link to they WIKI about LAME: http://wiki.hydrogenaudio.org/index.php?title=LAME"
,theseus,2007-03-20T19:15Z,Thanks for a genuine RARed scene release. aXXo? Who? What?
