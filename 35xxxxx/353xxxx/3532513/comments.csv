,uncleroy77,2006-10-03T03:28Z,"After all your efforts and all the positive feedback it almost seems redundant, but thank you, rudolfo2. I am almost embarassed by how much I look forward to each of these uploads."
,giuliana,2006-11-05T06:43Z,"Rudolfo... these are such a great find!  Incredible!  I just saw Women on the Verge and All About My Mother at a Almodovar film fest and went in search of more of his films to purchase.  Unfortunately, I was not able to find many until finding yours.  Thank you!
I have one question though... I was able to burn The Law of Desire with no problem, but Bad Education aborted soon after starting to burn.  (but I can still view it on my laptop) Has anyone else had problems burning Bad Education as well?

Once again, thanks a million!"
,giuliana,2006-11-05T07:14Z,"Excuse me, I apologize for the above... On second try, no problem burning at all. "
