,krypticchewie,2006-09-29T16:54Z,"I've had no problem with this file on CD on my player. And I have yet to get that error on any of the software players I use.
The audio was muxed using the official divXmux and divXmux gui."
,shickshaw,2006-10-15T16:29Z,Can anyone tell me how I have to do to see this movie in japanese with english subs?
,krypticchewie,2006-10-23T17:47Z,"To switch audio and subs either right click one the movie in DivX playre to get the options
or
If using anohter player ensure you have DivX 6.x installed and the DivX icon will appear in the taskbar. Right click on the icon to make the selections."

,3261dan,2008-05-07T19:27Z,"Could someone please comment on the quality of this download?

 How does it compare to the 700meg .Avi one?

 I ask coz I normally hate divx, don't know why anyone would ever use it... Very rare to download a Divx that is higher quality than an .Avi of half he size."

FYI: 90% of non-HD/BlueRay videos are DivX, just maybe not the .divx format. So, in fact, your said .avi file, is DivX encoded."
