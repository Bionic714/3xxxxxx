Now, for the first time, this \"One Night Only! Rod Stewart Live At Royal Albert Hall\" DVD captures the legendary rock n\' roller performing some of his greatest hits and newfound \"Great American Songbook\" classics at the world famous Royal Albert Hall in London, England. The concert captures electrifying performances by Rod Stewart with Chrissie Hynde (The Pretenders), his former Faces mate Ronnie Wood, and a talented new musical discovery, Amy Belle. The special gala concert also features Rod accompanied by the 60-piece BBC Concert Orchestra, the London Community Gospel Choir, and his own band and backing singers.

The British press raved about the one-night-only concert: The Daily Star exclaimed: \"This proves that he is still nothing short of astonishing live -- and long may he remain so. The atmosphere is amazing! A great barn-stormer of a gig,\" wrote The Guardian and the Evening Standard concurred: \"The surge of sheer pleasure that manifests itself through the audience during the opening notes of \"You Wear It Well\' prove that Rod Stewart still does it for people. \"Handbags & Gladrags\" increases the rush, and \"Reason To Believe\" clinches the addiction.\"

The Times raved: \"A silky \'Blue Moon\' and a joyful \'What A Wonderful World\' were followed by \'As Time Goes By,\' sung as a duet with a darkly smouldering Chrissie Hynde ... If the enthusiasm of last night\'s crowd was anything to go by, there could be several more (Songbook) volumes to come yet.\"

For three decades now, Rod Stewart has been an iconic force in the realm of popular music. Through a stellar catalog of classic songs -- many of which he\'s written or co-written -- he\'s earned his place in the pantheon of genuine musical legends. His infinitely expressive voice, sly wit, and a truly electrifying stage presence have earned Rod Stewart a place in the hearts and lives of millions of fans worldwide.
