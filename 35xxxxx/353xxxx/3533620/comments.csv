http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3502092/Swervedriver_-_Raise

I ripped  that one myself.  Don't know if the torrent's still active, though.

It's an extremely good record.  If anyone likes loud, noisy rock they will love Raise.  You're right that it's a classic.  If you have Mezcal Head I'd love to have that.  My copy's been lost for years."
