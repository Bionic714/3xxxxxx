The Matrix, originally shown in 1999.  I'm sure you've seen it.

This version contains a high-quality XviD encode using a very recent version of MEncoder, muxed with AC3 5.1 and full chapter names (english), all in a nice Matroska container.

If you cannot play this video, I recommend getting VLC <http://videolan.org/vlc/>.
