,FSxPilot,2006-09-30T13:45Z,Yep I agree that PES is not a simulation as such. What I meant is that PES has much more simulation type setup features when compared to FIFA. And no I don't get my information from commercials I am talking out of personal experience. FIFA is a game that once you figured it out gets boring. But the strategic aspect of PES is what keeps my interest.
