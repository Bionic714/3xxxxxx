A brief telling of the history of Iraq to describe it's huge importance and the politics involved with OPEC nations leads in to a chilling account of the the events that unfolded in the lead up to the war. News samples build the tension as the invasion is prepared, then you are pounded with an audio barage the brings war home to you and makes you acknowledge the reality of what happend. 
A chilling history lesson of the destruction of the origin of language, mathematics, justice and civilisation itself for a black tar from beneath the ground."
