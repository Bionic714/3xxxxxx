Tasker was created to record your mouse and keyboard actions, and then play them back as many times as you like, at the speed that you require. Tasker can even run unattended or as a scheduled task that occurs automatically. Common uses of Tasker are to do boring and repetitive typing, logging in to Internet sites, or automating administrative processes when you are not at your computer. "
