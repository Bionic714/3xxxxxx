This is a fully working copy of Norton Internet Security Suite 2006. Install all applications and then run a live update to get the latest virus definitions etc.

Registering this software will give you 3 months licence with Symantec. After the inital 3 months period your subscription will expire.. Not to worry, Read the instructions in the folder \"Subscription Limit Remover\".  

1. Browse to: C:\\Documents and Settings\\All Users\\Application Data\\Symantec\\LiveSubscribe and locate the \'LiveSubscribe\' file.  

2. Then replace this file with the one in the \"subscription Limit Remover\" folder and re-boot your PC.

4. Launch Live Update again and let it perform all updates now your subscription is extended. Then re-boot again (Norton may do this automatically).

3. After re-boot, launch the Security Suite menu and check your subscription Status.. This should now have extended your subscription to 2072!!!

4. If this hasnt worked, repeat all steps again (This definately does work!!)

*NB. You must allow your subscription to totally expire before performing these insctructions or it will not work!! Even the first day of expiration is ok..
