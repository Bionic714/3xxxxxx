So, here is a slightly more balanced commentary from IMDB to even things out a bit:

Right-wing propaganda, 19 September 2008
5/10
Author: lastliberal from Florida

In a recent British poll, George Bush was second to Osama bin Laden and ahead of Kim Jong-Il and Iranian president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad as the person most threatening to world peace. So, since we are about to be ride of the second most dangerous person in the World, maybe we ought to know something about the man the British considers the first. Especially when taxpayers are paying to have the DVD distributed through their local newspapers.

Of course, we have to take this film with a grain of salt - maybe a bucket of salt, as it is only promoted by Fox News, Glen Beck, Rush Limbaugh and the the right wing Olin Foundation.

Despite the fact that one website called the Writer/Director Wayne Kopping ""an award-winning filmmaker,"" I can find no evidence of this and he has only made anti-Muslim films to the best of my knowledge. It has to be noted that his background makes making these films a logical step. Do not expect an unbiased approach.

There is a distinct pro-Israel bias in the presentation of information in this so-called anti-extremist Muslim film. The overwhelming data presented is pertaining to those who hate Israel, and by extension we are supposed to believe they hate Westerners. They hate Westerners and the US to the extent that they support Israel. No nation that is not overtly pro-Israel is mentioned, nor are any examples given of terrorist attacks.

The question of why they attacked a the US on 9/11 is quickly dismissed as irrelevant and the terrorism is directly attached to religious belief. It is well documented that Osama bin Laden attacked the US because of our military forces in the Islamic Holy Land.

Those who watch this expecting an unbiased approach are advised that they are getting the same propaganda that the film criticizes. "

2  Ye shall not add unto the word which I command you, neither shall ye diminish ought from it, that ye may keep the commandments of the LORD your God which I command you.
3  Your eyes have seen what the LORD did because of Baalpeor: for all the men that followed Baalpeor, the LORD thy God hath destroyed them from among you.
4  But ye that did cleave unto the LORD your God are alive every one of you this day.
5  Behold, I have taught you statutes and judgments, even as the LORD my God commanded me, that ye should do so in the land whither ye go to possess it.
6  Keep therefore and do them; for this is your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the nations, which shall hear all these statutes, and say, Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people.
7  For what nation is there so great, who hath God so nigh unto them, as the LORD our God is in all things that we call upon him for?
8  And what nation is there so great, that hath statutes and judgments so righteous as all this law, which I set before you this day?
9  Only take heed to thyself, and keep thy soul diligently, lest thou forget the things which thine eyes have seen, and lest they depart from thy heart all the days of thy life: but teach them thy sons, and thy sons' sons;"
