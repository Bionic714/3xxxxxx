One of my favourite Coen brothers movies. =)

The Dude. One cool guy. Who one day comes home to find two thugs have broken and and ruined his favourite carpet--the one that made the room. "It really tied the room together" The confusion comes from the fact that he has the same last name as one of the richest guys in town and becomes involved in quest to reclaim the money to replace his soiled rug.

This is a rip straight from the DvD. NTSC. It has both Standard 4:3 and Widescreen. I used Nero and it only supported NRG format. I will try to find a way to make a ISO too.
