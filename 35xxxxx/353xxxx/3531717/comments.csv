,charlesb1,2006-10-17T04:53Z,I've downloaded this 3.1.2 facegen and guess what this guy put a key gen that works only on the 3.0 version why 'cause there is no key gen for this version at all so this guy slap in a non working gen just for fun I guess :(
,tomi7711,2007-02-12T20:01Z,Coool! Thx!
,Dr Benway,2007-06-04T23:10Z,Can someone seed this one ?
,leumasgee,2007-09-19T19:05Z,"Don't mind what charelsb1 said....he was just too stupid to read the directions.  And they are quite easy to follow.  If you are using this for oblivion check out this program http://www.box.net/shared/3rxhsey5yt .
It directly imports any facegen model onto your char in oblivion.

,VisionFactory,2007-10-12T04:20Z,"awesome thanks for the hint leumasgee
I just wanna try this thing in Oblivion. works great!"
,Lorenzox,2007-12-11T21:57Z,Is it any other game you can put the face on? or just Oblivian
,skull,2008-06-29T19:26Z,@Lorenzox: I think Football Manager 2008 has also this option
,hazonku,2009-01-24T19:28Z,"Just an FYI for everyone, not saying there's anything malicious in this torrent but it popped hot for a Win32 malware trojan on Avast, I'm just gonna assume it's cuz of the low tech keygen. I'll run it anyway & let you all know if it goes well or tries to kill my computer."
,hazonku,2009-01-24T19:40Z,"Yup this one was a no go. blah blah blah... windows could not acces the right path, file etc. blah blah, you might not have the right permissions, blah blah blah. I'm running XP media Center Edition... Any suggestions guys? I follwed the included direction exactly."
,ed420,2009-06-13T12:48Z,can someone seed for 15 minutes.. and allow max download rofl
,S53,2009-07-12T04:17Z,"Yeah, thanks for posting this. Really appreciate it. I'm trusting that nothing malicious is packed with it. "
,RenayT,2009-08-12T12:41Z,Works flawlessly. Thanks.
,Foaman,2010-06-15T06:00Z,3.4 request. :)
,haidaboy,2010-11-20T04:25Z,"This worked perfectly.  There was no problem with the keygen as another person mentioned.  He must have made a mistake somehow. 

(I used this programme for Oblivion, but I think it has other uses also).

Thanks for sharing it."
,harvengure,2011-03-04T02:03Z,"Downloaded quickly, scanned cleaned with exception of false positive from keygen.  Install was easy and software works perfectly on Win7.

As near as I can tell the site code does not need the last two characters to be entered into the keygen.

I will keep seeding."
,LymphN0de,2012-01-22T05:37Z,"How do you use the custom model set? I'm trying to switch but it just opens a window saying go to their website for more information, I click ok but no other window opens to allow me to change sets. Please help =)"
