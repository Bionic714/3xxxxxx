...::::  Why WeSC uses The Pirate Bay  ::::...

WeSC is more than just another brand on the market ? WeSC ha a story to tell, a background to be proud of. And WeSC is surrounded by a lot of interesting peoples, which has a lot of interesting things to say, we call them Weactivists. 
The very best way to connect to the idea behind WeSC is to watch it on film, to hear other people tell their version of what they think WeSC stands for. That?s what we?ve done with ?The WeSC Calendar?. And since we own all the copyrights to it ? we want to spread it world wide as fast as we can. That?s why we started this collaboration with The Pirate Bay.
And the bittorrent technique makes it possible to reach out with a large amount of information to a massive crowd in no time.
