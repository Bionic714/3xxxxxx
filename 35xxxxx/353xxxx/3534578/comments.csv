,Reese Kaine,2006-12-17T03:14Z,"Just out of curiosity, can anyone make it to the New York missions without the game crashing to the desktop?"
,stiltet,2006-12-22T10:31Z,I'm sorry dudes.. It seems to be a problem with yhe crack. Try google for another.
,NNT~Dark Deity,2007-02-02T10:25Z,"say, stiltet.....if you happen to know what proggie to use to open the .exe to recode it then I can re-crack it, test, then send out....if that would help at all....unless someone's already done that by now"

,TheDemonLord,2008-02-03T21:23Z,"I too was having the issue, but a reinstall of the small version, patching, cracking then setting it to run in Windows 98 Compatability worked fine,"
,Löfvet,2008-04-23T09:06Z,"can you please upload ""pyramiden: gåtan vid nilens strand""?"
,littlemermaid123,2008-07-08T23:20Z,"Oh :o ""Pyramiden - Gåtan vid Nilens strand""

I would really love if you'll put it up for download! :)"
,mp198,2008-07-14T13:12Z,"I'm having no luck with this at all. I installed Deamon Tools and followed the instructions to the letter, I think, but I just get told to insert the cd.

When you say, ""Copy the ""crimson.exe"" crack file, from the crack directory on the cd in to your install directory"", I am assuming you mean that I should paste it onto the CLOKSPL.EXE file.

I daresay you have a thousand other things to do but I would be very grateful if you could offer a bit more explanation in the instructions. For a novice like me, it is a bit vague. Cheers.

,KaptenStek,2008-07-15T15:58Z,Oh my..  can you please upload Pyramiden - Gåtan vid Nilens strand? PLEASE i've been waiting for this torrent for ages!

,haraldsuger,2009-11-04T16:58Z,"ITS NOT DEAMON! ITS DAEMON!
BTW thanx for the game : stiltet :P"
,greazar,2010-03-27T21:12Z,... anyone else notice he spelled simulator wrong?
,Deception45,2010-07-27T17:42Z,"I really don't get why people expect games from 10 years ago to have cutting edge graphics.  Just because you download it in 2010 doesn't mean it's gonna have 2010 graphics.  The game doesn't just magically update with the rest of the world.

Though that would be pretty epic...."
