I - Game Description:

"The year is 1937.The United States has shattered under the combined weight of the Great Depression, regional Prohibition
and mounting isolationism. The transcontinental railroad and the budding highway system have become useless as they now
cross hostile borders. Commerce and trade leave the ground as air travel now becomes a vital lifeline connecting allied
countries -- and a national obsession -- while daring air pirates and valiant air militias battle for control of the
skies. Giant zeppelins crisscross the skies, carrying both passengers and cargo. It is a time of gunship diplomacy and
airship piracy. It is the age of the fighter pilot and a time of daredevil adventure and sinister intrigue. It is the
world of Crimson Skies?"

"It's 1937 and air pirates roam the skied over a shattered America. You are Nathan Zachary - air pirate, ace pilot and
notorious ladies' man. Lead a squadron of aerial privateers in thrilling ground level missions while dogfighting exotic
combat planes and romacing a bevy of beautiful vixens along the way."
