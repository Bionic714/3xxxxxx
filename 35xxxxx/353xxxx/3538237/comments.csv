,simon_simonring,2006-10-16T19:24Z,Is this the real game or just a demo???
,Fisknils,2006-10-18T22:08Z,"It's the real game.
You wont be able to play it on the public servers unless your account is enabled for burning crusade use though.
Additionally, no private servers for this beta seems to exist as of now.
There *are* private servers for the alpha, though I doubt they are of any use, unless you only want to explore. (rumor has it there are no mobs or items)."
