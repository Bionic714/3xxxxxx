,inuyasha-d00d,2006-10-02T17:08Z,"Also notice that this is the only seeded Driver 2 download. :P

I thought, well, the other downloads are either not fully downloading or dont work, so I then thought that I'll put my Driver 2 onto the site, and the results were positive, I'm getting peers (About 3 right now) And I hope you guys seed aswell, to keep this download alive because I know that lots of people still LOVE the Driver series and still needs to put Driver 2 to their collection...

,Blayz1996,2010-11-12T20:56Z,not bad im kidding its great 
,mistamontiel,2011-01-29T08:23Z,"I've had a concern for this.

Damn it. Is this version 1.0 or Greatest Hits 1.1 ?

I always mount disc images in Daemon Tools Lite. And Run CD-R0M. ePSXe 1.7

Regardless, CD2 won't play thru after the grueling CD1 missions. All I found was you can use PSX Emulation Cheater and select a mission. Still pretty sucky.

Another odd thing, even the finale mission, Lenny Gets Caught played. On Disc 1."
,NoNeX2,2011-06-01T14:54Z,"SOMEBODY HELP!!!
How to mount these files if daemon tools doesn't support .bin files and i mouned them opened ePSXe and it sayd that no cd was found :( please somebody say step by step to me please :("
,X-Offender,2011-08-21T20:33Z,"Disc 2 won't play. I'm using ePSXe. I played Disc 1 by running the .bin file without having to mount it. But now I finished the last level of Disc 1, and no matter what I try, Disc 2 simply won't load. :("
