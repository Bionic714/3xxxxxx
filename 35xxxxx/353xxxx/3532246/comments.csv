XiSO's image did not boot if you burned their image using PC software. We found this to be problematic as your MAC may not be functioning, and that is why you downloaded the new OS X Tiger.  But if your MAC, is dead, how can you repair or upgrade it if you can't make a bootable OS X CD?  So, here is your solution, an image that can be burned on either a MAC or PC, and still be bootable.

     1. Unrar, burn.
     2. Install.
     3. Enjoy!
