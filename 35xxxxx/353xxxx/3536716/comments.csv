,meu56th,2006-10-10T18:11Z,"nisse59 - Sorry but I don't understand your comment... Areyou are having trouble with this release?

It's very simple... This is not a patch or a keygen, this is a modified executable to replace the TomTom original executable file, you must copy the file in this archive to your PDA and replace the one thats installed by the TomTom installer, then when you run TomTom on your PDA, it does not ask you for product activation code any more.

NOTE :- This release works fine with the updated TomTom 5 maps (ie v 632) but you *must* have an original version 5 map (ie v567 map) installed on your PDA, the v5 map does not need to be selected, as long as it's there and TomTom can see it when it starts up then your newer v632 maps will work perfectly.

Most people install Guam map v567 because it's only 355k and doesn't take up much room on your PDA. With Guam installed, *ALL* v632 maps will work without product activation using this cracked executable !"

works also fine with WM2003SE !

conditions:

,meu56th,2006-11-08T20:31Z,"@bricker:
Thanks for the additional information and the comment, this file has been downloaded over 500 times on Pirate Bay and you are the only person that left a comment to say it works, no one has even said 'thanks' for me taking the trouble to release it...

I could only test it on my Windows Mobile 5 device, the original version of TT5 wouldn't even install to WM5 so I had to grab the 5.2xx update from TomTom, which did install ok, but then I found there was no crack for it so I had to do it my self..

It should work for all versions of Windows Mobile OS, as long as TomTom say it's supported, then it will work, I only made a very small change in the code to by-pass the serial number check, so everything else is the same as the official TomTom file, but thanks again for the feedback.

@everyone
If you download this file, please COMMENT if this works for you, so others know this is a quality release !!!!

Also, please help me SEED this very small little file, it won't take up much of your band width and it will help keep the download alive for others, my system doesn't have internet access 24/7 so it would be nice to know that others can still download when Im not on line, thanks !

I see you have spammed almost every new torrent at PB with your shit, get a life and stop trying to trick people in to installing spyware or tricking them in to voting for you or what ever your scheme is.

Its probably not safe to click the links he keeps spamming all over PB, so I suggest you don't click on it."
,scotsblood,2007-02-11T16:22Z,Sorry but what did build 5431 do? Reason to go up from 5430?
,meu56th,2007-02-13T03:59Z,"As far as I know, they added support for Windows Mobile 5 in build 5431, so if your not running a WM5 device, there *may* be no need to update.

5431 is the only version I could get to install on my WM5 Dell AXIM X51v, when I tried to install an earlier version, it said my operating system was not supported.

There may be other improvements also in 5431, I really don't know for sure, all I do know is, if you go to the TomTom site and search for the latest update for TT5, then you will find build 5431, and if TomTom say thats the current version, then thats good enough for me...

If you are concerned about the saftey of this cracked exe, you should get a binary compare program such as Beyond Compare and then run a binary compare on the original exe installed by the TomTom build 5431 installer, and the version I cracked in this archive, and you will see only a very small change in the code (2 lines of code) to make the serial number check go away.

I want to say thanks to the people who are keeping my seed alive, I am not at home for the next few months and so my bitcomet computer is  off, without these seeds, this torrent would die.

Please seed this tiny file if you download it, help keep the seed alive for others, I will be back home in 3 months and I will be seeding again, am working in another country until then, thanks."
,rabbiteer,2007-04-18T15:58Z,"Never heard of BitTorrent and WinRAR before - fell over this file via Google- so it tooka bit of work to find out how to get to the useable exec file, however once done and loaded onto my Mio A201, WM v5,  it runs very sweetly.  I no longer have all the hassel of a suposedly compatable GPS failing to talk to my iPAQ on which I have my fully legit TomTom. And dont have to spend hours on the phone explaining why I have yet another PDA"
,meu56th,2007-05-05T14:52Z,"Glad to help rabbiteer, thanks for the comment :-)"
,Bunker Buster,2007-11-03T12:18Z,Will this work with HTC Tytn II/kaiser?
,meu56th,2007-11-05T20:27Z,"Hmmm, the HTC Tytn II uses windows mobile 6, not windows mobile 5.... not sure if they changed anything with WM6.

Have you looked on the TomTom site to see what they say ?

If it TomTom works with WM6 using the 5.2xx update, then it will work just fine, but they might need to make a new update for WM6 compatibility...

If they make a new update, I will crack that and upload it for you :-)"
,ed.barry,2008-03-06T14:06Z,"Excuse a question from a techie novice.

I have deleted, by mistake, a small 28kb data file from my PDA and now can't open TomTom Navigator 5 programme/maps.
I don't have the product code nor was it saved, so how can I,
1. Check that I have v567 maps on my PDA
2. Find the TomTom.exe file that must be replaced as a 'File Search' doesn't find it?"
,ed.barry,2008-03-06T14:34Z,"Further to the above, On searching for Guam 567 , 355k exe. file I find only  a 100Mb or 200Mb, via a 'Rapidshare' download- is there a link for the correct file?"
,ed.barry,2008-03-09T07:33Z,"Hoping you'll be along soon but a third question now that the tottent is sitting on my 'Desktop'. When I double click it I get a windows screen saying' Windows needs to know source etc,@ and neither of the two options work for me, so how do I get this file to my PDA?"
,meu56th,2008-05-21T17:38Z,"Sorry I didn't see your comments earlier ed, I still seed this but I don't check the comments on here too often any more as most people don't post...

Did you get it sorted or do you still need help ?

If you can remember the name of the file you deleted then I would be happy to upload my version of it for you to download..."
