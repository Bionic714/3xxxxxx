,variose,2006-12-06T12:55Z,"How do you use the crack technet11?

This file is a trialversion that anybody can download and at fotostation/fotoware webpage i think it says that the trialversion is not the full version? meaning that you get a new program or a patch when buying license?

But any way would be helpfull to know if this crack actually opens the trialversion?

and how to use it... thanks :-)


I have used an older version before that i actually bought :-)  But i lost my license after a hard drive crash. And also it was a long wait after windows editon before a new version come for Mac. So i startet to use Iview mediapro instead great program but only in english i think. it is small, fast and handle all multimedia for archive and som editing/gallery webpage making

much smaller and faster than lightroom from adobe and others. But same level of advance. if you have a small and not so fast computer it is great! (even greater if your computer is fast :-)

You can download from their webpage
serials is possible to find on net.

They where sadly just bought by microsoft :-(  hope they will not ruin the great work the company did before them..."
,variose,2006-12-06T13:28Z,"never mind, think i found out how. just replace the crack with the ""identical"" file with in fotostation programfolder... 

correct ?

Thanks :-)"
