,jfhjr,2012-08-19T21:50Z,"I hope there's still a seed of this! In '78 I wore this cassette out until the tape snapped! They just don't make music like this anymore! The ""hit"" from it was Never Been Any Reason (Save My Life I'm Goin' Down For The Last Time), but the song that sticks with me is Jefftown Creek - great post! Thanks! Will seed indefinitely!"
