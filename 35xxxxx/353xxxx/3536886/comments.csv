,iammendoza,2007-01-11T16:39Z,Guys i need help. I have no clue how to open your file. There is so many files...How do you open them? do you compile the video with rar zip or what program do you use to see the movie. I have VLC player and Classic media player with all the codecs. Please help. Thanks.
