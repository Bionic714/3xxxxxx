Recorded in 1971, this German album is a complex progressive rock effort with plenty of excellent guitar playing and a bizarre vocal style. Some nice psychedelic touches also feature and the disc comes housed in a digi-pak with a photo transparency cover. - freakemporium.com

Haze played excellent 1971 progressive rock with lots of impressive instrumental passages, but their lead-singer's voice sometimes sounded somewhat strange. Nevertheless it should be recommended for all fans of early 70s metal. Digipak CD-reissue with the original color-dia-gimmix-sleeve. ? rockadrome.com
