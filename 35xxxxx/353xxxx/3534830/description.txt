Plot:

The story begins with Wudan master Li Mu Bai (Chow Yun Fat) wanting to retire and giving his treasured sword, the "Green Destiny", to the friend of his late master. Though surprised with Li Mu Bai's decision, long-time friend Yu Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh) graciously accepts Li Mu Bai's wishes and delivers this 400-year old treasure to its new owner. Shortly thereafter, this unusually thin sword is stolen by a mysterious warrior who knows the Wudan martial art form. It turns out that the mysterious thief is no other than the seemingly innocent governor's daughter, Jen Yu (Zhang Ziyi), whose marriage is arranged to further her father's political career. Repressed by her duties as a governor's daughter, Jen Yu secretly wishes to live the life of a Wudan warrior -- a life of freedom, adventure, and glorious victories. Jen Yu is the disciple of the notoriously evil "Jade Fox". Li Mu Bai recognizes her strength and talent but also the evil influence of Jade Fox, and therefore wants to take her as his own disciple. But will he succeed in bringing her to the light?
