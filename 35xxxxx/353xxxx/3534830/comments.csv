,uncleroy77,2006-10-06T20:44Z,Thanks for this. The copy I previously downloaded was very hard to watch as the dialogue was dubbed in spanish with english subs. This is just the ticket.
,Ulven170,2006-10-07T05:20Z,"Superb upload, but is there anyone who has nordic subs... please...?"
,tredfxman,2006-10-08T00:07Z,"Thanks for this Dual Layer, i always wondered how a Superbit release will differ from a normal one. Anyone who knows? Is it about the sound?"
,Vishnu,2006-10-08T17:05Z,"yippie!
thanx! really looking forward to this one"
,BandarenIBaren,2007-12-03T14:08Z,"As far as I can see this isn't dual layer, its two R5."
,buzz_uk,2009-06-15T08:18Z,Thanks for the upload. A classic movie.
,old_gregg,2009-10-05T04:00Z,"Not to sound like a noob, but up until now I've never need the subs.
How does one incorporate them into a movie?
I use dvdflick to convert to a DVD from AVI & want to have the subs along with it.

Thanks"
