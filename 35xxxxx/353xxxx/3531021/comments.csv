There are some banners and pop ups, but show a good torrent site that is totally free from ""spam"""
,Mr_Ecks,2006-09-29T13:53Z,I wouldn't lable this as porn....
,BlackDahlia,2006-10-17T23:31Z,"Actually, this is NOT porn. It is rated R and was a 70's artsy-fartsy romance on an adult level. It does have a lot of nudity and sexual situations but would not qualify as even soft-core porn. See http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0075753/ for details."

What kinda weak ass logic is that? Just because it's not porn, doesn't mean it's fit for kids. There are shades of grey.

There's loads of not-porn, that I wouldn't show to my kids! ""Unfit for kids"" DOES NOT equal porn!

And there are some films with nudity I wouldn't want to watch with my kids but that's just because I'd feel embarrassed, NOT because I think it will harm them in any way.

Besides, I'd be ok if my kids see this, as long as I dont' have to watch it WITH them.

What kind of weak parent are you, that your kids will do all sorts of adult stuff after watching porn?

Sooooo .... after watching 24, are they immediately gonna torture their friends and siblings? 
Sooooo .... after watching LOST, are they immediately gonna do some timetraveling?
Sooooo .... after watching CSI-Miami, are they immediately gonna go shoot people in designer clothes?

You must be lousy at parenting if you let all that happen to your kids.

Bilitis is NOT porn"

A little more than screen of color patches."
