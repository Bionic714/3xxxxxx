,rnagy8,2006-10-09T20:35Z,"Guam map is included in the torrent package of TT 6,01 + crack. That is the default map...quite usefull :-)"

,spt100,2006-10-10T08:37Z,Maverick - TT6 does not see that map on my Axim X51v. Comparing to other maps your package does not contain *.mid file. Please check whether you have it on your Axim.
,Holle,2006-10-10T09:54Z,"Oslo91, you seem to be quite active on this TomTom things so can you verify does those PL-CZ-SK-HU maps really work on your iPAQ? You told that those are working with a V650.1111 so I quess you didn't try this V652.1211?

As 2mat already wondered so do I. Where these maps comes from 'cause there's no mention in TomTom's website about these four countries? Home made maps ;)

Hope we can have a real maps of those nice countries. Last time I was totaly lost in Czech because only ""main roads in WE"" was working with my TT5. Soon need to go to Slovakia...jaiks. How people can survive without navigators :)"
,vit7,2006-10-10T16:00Z,"Please help , how do we get it to work in tomtom?????
TT6 does not see that map on my Axim X51v."
,rnagy8,2006-10-10T21:41Z,"Guys, I suggest you to chose iGo 2006 once you need to leave for Eastern/Central Europe. Higher coverage smaller sizes and really operating maps..."
,Holle,2006-10-11T12:48Z,Thanx for the tip Maggy! iGO is on order :)
,2mat,2006-10-11T14:04Z,could anybody please seed igo 2006 for eastern europa if it works better  than tomtom6 
,Holle,2006-10-11T18:37Z,"It is already here:
http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3503699/iGO_2006_Europe_PDA_Navigation_Software"
,Holle,2006-10-11T18:45Z,"Darn, you were talking about Eastern Europe, not whole europe. But this iGO Europe 2006 seems to cover 26 countries including those eastern europe countries so you might want to DL that anyway. Here's a list what countries are included:

Andorra, Austria, Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Luxembourg, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Republic of Ireland, Romania, San Marino, Slovakia, Slovenia (only major roads), Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, The Netherlands, and United Kingdom"
,rnagy8,2006-10-11T23:01Z,"Besides those maps, I have just got the remaining available maps for iGo, e.g. Greece. I will share them soon."
,the maverick,2006-10-13T08:10Z,"If you have TomTom Home, use the latest download which contains the *.mid file. Just search for PL-CZ-SK-HU. TomTom only ""sell"" maps for popular places - remember PL is in the EU now"
,the maverick,2006-10-13T08:28Z,It is here: http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3538621/PL-CZ-SK-HU.rar
