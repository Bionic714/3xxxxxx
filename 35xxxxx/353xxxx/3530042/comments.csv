,zembla,2006-09-28T20:22Z,"Download and install : 
Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 Redistributable Package (x86)

then the keygen will work.

,loke.nor,2006-09-28T22:17Z,"But what when the program doesn't work when installed in ppc? I get the keygen to work, but the program doesn't start:-("
,zigma2,2006-09-29T01:34Z,Thanks Zembla!
,rstran,2006-10-11T04:07Z,"If your program won't start, or you are getting missing or corrupt files, try and free up some memory, you gotta have more than 20 meg free for this thing to run"
,spacedehouf,2006-10-13T23:01Z,"It's asking for serial number. the ""how to"" file say's we can put any serial, it doesn't matter, but no. 
If we can put any serial, What is the serial form ?
XXXX-XXXX-XXXX or XXX-XX-XXX ?"
,MrChompy,2006-10-22T23:13Z,Keygen doesn't work - even after installing C++ libs  as described above
,noxus,2006-11-06T23:43Z,"installion of GPS Tuner went OK
the keygen is running fine

!!! BUT the generated keys do NOT work !!!

too bad, would have loved this program."
,Master_Shake_,2006-11-08T18:09Z,"Still can not get it to reg, program runs, keygen runs, but key is invalid"
,Alein,2006-12-03T03:47Z,"It is working but you need to:

 Installation

1. Unzip, Install the software and run it.
2. Click register/activate (be sure to not be connected to 
   the internet).
3. Enter a serial Number(whatever you want). 
4. Click OK (u don't care about the message that says it cannot 
   connect to the registration server..)
5. Enter the custom key in the keygen to generate a valid 
   activation key (normal or geo).

What is not written that custom key must be with ""-"" like 1234-1234 but not 12341234.

,spacedehouf,2006-12-19T11:47Z,"Thanks Alein, I understood well now anbd it works well.

I put 12345678-12345678 as serial and I choosed GEO version in Keygen to have access to all options of the soft.

,vcorle,2006-12-20T01:04Z,"spacedehouf and Alein, how do you do it ?
I'm trying to put custom in upper case, in lower case, with and without '-', standard and geo but registration codes don't work. 
Which is the format of registration code ?? 5 numbers ??
Thanks in advance"
,bruttobastardo,2007-01-24T01:27Z,I assume you mean install on the PDA first and then register while running it on the PDA?
,john-dvr,2007-01-31T07:23Z,"after downloading C++, it works , thanks a lot"
,podula,2007-02-01T08:48Z,"How do I download a torrent?

I click on the downloaded file and nothing happens:(
"
,bitfikler,2007-02-23T13:44Z,"The code from the keygen is not working.....
I write the custom key into the keygen (nnnn-nnnn), and get a code back (5 digits). But the code is not accepted by the program.
Anyone who have got this to work, or know another keygen that is working????

,duro07,2007-04-20T11:36Z,"Keygen works only with version 5.0 (WM2003), not work with version 5.1(WM5), but version 5.0 works fine on WM5 systems
(WM5 on Orange SPV-M3100 (HTC-TyTN))"
,Guesswhotoo6,2008-06-03T19:29Z,"FYI... if you try to install under vista it may complain that there is no active sync installed.... ignore this and simply copy the *.cab and *.ini files to a directory on the PDA.  use explorer on the PDA to execute the cabs.  1st run will ask for the name and key info.  all set, works like a champ, fast too. installed tested under wm2003"
,default_user8,2008-08-16T20:55Z,Just a heads up! If you download this torrent you better have your adware working and updated since it is infected.  And on a different note.  You can enter any serial number you want it doesn't matter.  Run the keygen and then put the file it creates in your GPS TUner folder.

,influxed,2009-07-27T00:49Z,Make sure to delete your name from the register page for the key to work.
