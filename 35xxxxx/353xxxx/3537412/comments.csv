,skeppstroll,2007-03-11T22:40Z,"Sorry to say this but....this movie realy sucks, kinda like Druids (Slaget om Gallien) but hannibal is even more poorly made and the acting is just lame....

Great video\sound quality thought, and its free. Just warning those who might consider watching it........ "
