,kshipper,2006-10-07T20:30Z,"When I created the Torrent it asked me if I want to seed which I said ""Yes!' ...I see that there is one seeder here and I assume that's me? Is there anything else I can do? I know it does take time for others to get the complete file from me then there should be more seeders soon! I am glad there are so many Sprout fans---They are great!"
