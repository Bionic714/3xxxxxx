,hacke75,2006-09-29T13:58Z,"Tack!

Som jag har v채ntat p책 denna! U2:s b채sta konsertinspelning!"
,celebpicture,2006-09-30T00:17Z,"Thanks, Great release !!   Ntsc or Pal ?"
,SR71blackbird,2006-09-30T11:18Z,It's PAL.
[V],trixiehobbit,2006-10-01T21:25Z,"Idiot! Why do you seed to so many at this moment? Cut down your numbers of connection so you super-seed, instead of whining over your lousy connection"
,SR71blackbird,2006-10-02T07:54Z,Nag nag nag
,JeroenG88,2006-10-02T11:11Z,"Dont nag him! It's a great release! Wonderfull sound, PAL! I love this! But hell, it takes a very long time.. Well, he's the guy that releases it, he's the man, dont nail him! Just accept it and enjoy! Thanks blackbird! "
,SR71blackbird,2006-10-02T17:07Z,"If somebody has suggestions to speed up the upload and is able to tell in a normal way how to do it i'll be happy to. It is only my second upload (first one was U2 vertigo 2005, and it took forever to upload). So if anybody has hints (and isn't socially disabled like 'you know who') feel free to tell me. I use Azureus and have superseeding enabled with a max. of 2 connections per torrent (this one is the only one at the moment)."
,rkrijger,2006-10-03T20:32Z,"Currently I'm at 90.7% and it runs at 23KB/s. My program predicts 100% will be reached in 16h:20m. The speed will increase when more seeders are present.

Strange though, that my program (ABC) reports no seeders and the website reports 1 seeder.

Thanks for the up!"
,JeroenG88,2006-10-04T13:50Z,"Hell! Wonderfull.. almost in! But i'm quit stuck at 99,13.. No seeders i'm connected with (i see there are 3 currently?!) Come one.. the last 0,87 percent? Please! Can't wait! ;) Thank U so much Blackbird!"
,JeroenG88,2006-10-04T15:16Z,"I see i've got a connection with te seeder? (giving me 15kb/s at the moment?!) Please, stay in contact with mee, i will seed for a few weeks.. Got quit a fast connection.. I promise.."
,rkrijger,2006-10-04T18:18Z,"I'm at 99.8% currently. But very, very, very few progress...

We'll see..."
,JeroenG88,2006-10-04T18:41Z,"100% Great! Damn.. i love this dvd, Love is blindness is wonderfull! Damn.. i wish is was older in those years (i was 5 then, now im 18) Damn.. thank U so much!"
,SR71blackbird,2006-10-04T18:51Z,"Great!! Enjoy! I was 23 at that time, been to the ZOO TV concert at the Feyenoord stadium myself in 1993. This one brings back memories."
,SR71blackbird,2006-10-04T19:00Z,"Just checked, May the 10th 1993 Feynoord stadium Rotterdam. Damn I still got the t-shirt I bought there, doesn't fit anymore though."
,JeroenG88,2006-10-04T19:28Z,Dutch guy 2 ;)
,rkrijger,2006-10-04T19:48Z,"Got it! Already enjoying it!
Leve U2!"

[V],trixiehobbit,2006-10-05T22:38Z,Sorry for nagging you earlier SR71blackbird. Finally we got it down. Very nice UL with perfect Quality. Thanks! :-D
,SR71blackbird,2006-10-06T16:37Z,Glad you like it. Anybody interested in more U2 stuff? Got all the DVD's except The joshua tree which is a documentary and not a concert. Any suggestions for my next upload?
,mansie,2006-10-07T13:04Z,"Thanks!

Can anyone put Disc 2 online aswell??

SR71blackbird maybe?"
,SR71blackbird,2006-10-09T20:41Z,No I'am sorry don't have the 2 disc version.  It only contains some documentary and  it was twice the price of the one disc version (with the concert). You know Dutch people always want it cheap!!
,Shr3k,2006-11-12T12:30Z,"Thank you SR71blackbird.

But what really sucks is lack of solidarity of the damn leechers! They only downloading until they finish, with upload bandwidth limited to ridicilous value.

Otherwise I can't explain my stats.
