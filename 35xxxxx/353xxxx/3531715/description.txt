3DMeNow Professional is our top-of-the-range human modeling package. Used to build recognizable human and character models for interactive 3D games and broadcast animation, this software produces amazingly lifelike 3D head data (models, textures and morph states) in a fraction of the time taken with conventional manual authoring techniques.

Creates data suitable for use in 3DSMaxTM, MayaTM, SoftImageTM and most industry standard 3D authoring applications.
