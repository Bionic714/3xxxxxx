,ghrayfahx,2006-10-14T22:26Z,"Dude, Lay off. Just cause you're an idiot who doesn't know how to install something. If you actually had some kinda clue, you'd see that this works GREAT, and is just as good if not better than Gasgiver's release. Stop trolling."
,Tcip,2006-10-14T23:29Z,You can't build a god build. You copy a nother one ... 
,ghrayfahx,2006-10-15T00:49Z,"I Download my source from the CVS, I insert the scripts myself, and I add MC360 and the mods myself. Tell me how that's copying another build. I fail to see it. Oh well, I'll keep making and releasing my builds. If people like them, they're welcome to get them. If not, then they don't need to use it. It's their choice."
