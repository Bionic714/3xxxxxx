Plot Synopsis from allmovie.com

The Yugoslav Man is Not a Bird stars Milena Dravic as a Serbian heavy-machinery specialist. A lifelong bachelor, Dravic suddenly falls for Eva Ras, several years his junior. Though a flawlessly expert engineer, Dravic is hopelessly inept when its comes to courtship. He eventually loses Ras to someone who knows the score. The predictable but likeable Man is Not a Bird is directed in a refreshing free-form fashion (intercutting "reality" footage of the bleakness indigenous to mid-1960s Yugoslavia) by Dusa Makaveyev, whose first film this was; Makaveyev would go on to international fame by virtue of 1967's controversial Love Affair: Or, the Case of the Missing Telephone Girl.
