But do you NEED to see these before you start watching season 3?"
,Ekstreme,2006-10-01T00:50Z,"You don't 'NEED' to, but it will make things a little clearer I believe"
,i2mfan,2006-10-01T03:37Z,"Thank's for the credit. :D

I should have renamed them all but wanted to keep the original name. ;)

You forgot the .MIS and should have waited for the 10 episodes before making a pack unless you planned another one?

You can download all of them from my site if the speed is not fast enougth for your taste:

Just leave a ""Tip"" is you do(click one time a Google ad). It pays for the extra bandwidth. Those are very popular :D

Ekstreme is right"
