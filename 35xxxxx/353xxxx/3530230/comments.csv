,rdbrady,2006-09-28T14:18Z,This game sucks so hard. The interface is practically unuseable.
,the_inquisition,2006-09-28T15:26Z,"Yep; buggy and unstable if not patched. Gets boring very quickly, not much to do nor any real backstory.

Get Sid Meiers Pirates! instead. Much much better."

This game is truly a freelancer at its best. The options they give you for how you play are nearly limitless. The new STORM engine used makes everything look incredibly. The detail that is placed in it really shows. Getting caught in a tropical storm (While causing some damage to your ship) looks absolutley amazing.

Unlike many other caribbean style pirate games, Age of Pirates lets you become the ultimate terror of the caribbean. Through diplomacy, destruction, and trade you can set sail to make your fortune and increase your power.

The charecter leveling set up in this game is very simiular to the Fallout games. There are a dozen different primary skills that can be increased. These include leadership, trading, smuggling, (Yes trading and smuggling are both different skills.) fencing, pistol, tactics, boarding, sailing, and many more. The hiring of personal officers will also increase these skills if you put them in the correct department aboard your ship. I.E. your navigator would go in the navigation spot aboard the vessel.

As well as the primary skills you also develope traits, much like the traits from the fallout series. There are a few dozen traits that can be selected. Some that have draw backs as well as perks. (For example the beserker cannon ablility, while increasing to the load times of the cannons also increases the chances of an accidental explosion on deck.)

Your officers are the back bone to your fleet. Each one is set up much like your own charecter. They will level up and increase there skills and traits. Each officer has there own inventory so you can aquire new equipment like swords and pistols and give them to your officers. You can hire as many as you like (If you can afford it.) They will also demand raises as they level up. A free officer is required in order to capture a ship or a town for your own personal use. Officers are also able to be placed on your flagship as specialists. Specialists increase your own skills. There are about a dozen different spots you can place them, such as surgeon, navigator, gunner, etc. Beware though, keeping a good eye on there loyalty is a must. A disloyal officer can be the loose end that starts a full out mutiny should conditions for your crew become less then desirable.

You have the option of working for any of the four major political powers to increase your military rank while also working towards leveling up your charecter. The missions that the governors give you vary greatly. They include destroying trade ships, deliviring messages to spy's, eliminating or kidnapping high ranking officers, and capturing rival cities in your countrys name. The perks for this include the full support of your nation should you piss up the wrong tree.

However if working for the gorvement is not your flavor, there is the option of becoming a master trader or (My favorite) a pirate that can truly choose to adventure in his or hers own personal style.

The trade system in game is very elaborate. There are two different trade areas. Legit trade and Smuggling. Legit trade is a good way to start as you don't have to worry about pissing off the authorities. There is a huge selection of tradeable items and it requires keeping track of were certain items are produced and were the towns are that have limited access to certain items. The pay can be good if you invest in ships that have large holds such as the galleon. However the real money from tradeing comes in smuggling. Smuggling ilegal items for trade can be tricky but oh so rewarding. There is a large selection of ilegal goods available (Including slaves.) They can be purchased from other smugglers or stolen from the holds of other pirates through ship combat. Slaves are aquired through capturing any ship without killing the crew. (A large trade ship that surrenders without a fight can be a very vauluable prize. The best way to do this is by eliminating any escorts and using the chain shot to destroy its sails.)
