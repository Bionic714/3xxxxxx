,oogabooga222,2007-07-22T05:46Z,"heya,
this torrent does not contain  Episode 13: Justice or the first episode of season 2, 
 Voicemail. to make matters more confusing all the episodes are labeled one episode ahead of what the actually are. can someone please repost episode 13 ? thanks"
,canadianboy2,2007-08-29T08:20Z,"This torrent works great; all episodes are in order and work fine. End credits missing on few. oogabooga22 is out to lunch (likely works for the network), all episodes are here, in order and labelled correctly, entire season 3, 1-13 enjoy and thanks to whomever put this together! Bring on season 4 "
,hÃ¥rsmacka,2007-10-15T13:47Z,"I got all 13 episodes.
Still it seems like ive missed something between episode 12 on the 2nd season and the first on this season.
Very confusing...

,abbey4000,2008-01-15T01:41Z,Episodes 7-13 are not recognized by any player or GSpot. Episodes 1-6 are fine.
,ragigaji,2008-02-15T17:50Z,thanks to all who enabled me to get this top quality 
,TheDonkee,2008-02-27T19:19Z,All episodes work fine using VLC media Player. Anyone who says otherwise is just spoiling.
,mufuti9,2008-07-20T01:05Z,"@hårsmacka: Well judging from your comment you seem to have missed the final episode of season 2, episode 13 :-P

This torrent is fine, contains all episodes, all correctly labeled but unfortunately only the TV rips.

There is a dvd out of course but it seems to be impossible to find a rip of it."
,markennz,2009-03-07T22:45Z,thanks!
,BreakingBadFan,2012-07-12T22:57Z,"wow no comments for 3 years, torrent is still active for those who would like to download. Pretty slow download considering how old it is but not that bad. Quality is GREAT, this is the torrent you should download."
