,monofool,2008-08-21T06:51Z,"OK!!
got it folks.
you need to download H2o key gen.
its a pc file(exe).
so you need a pc.
generate a serial on the pc.
enter it on the mac.
then mac generates another key you enter in to the pc then you enter it back into the mac,
eventually it works and you are rocking..
