,dontmesswithme,2006-10-18T15:52Z,Thanks for unlocking this problem. BUT a small problem. CD6 will not mount - downloaded it twice to be sure. Any thoughts?
,beren12,2006-10-25T06:00Z,"Yeah, I noticed that too. Try to open it in somehting other than DiskUtil, Toast was able to mount it for me. Maybe once it's mounted you can make a disk image of it again."
,pomares,2006-10-28T16:09Z,"Did Toast do it for you ""dontmesswithme""?"
,Gruh,2006-11-23T18:55Z,CD6 of http://thepiratebay.org/details.php?id=3346905 works fine.
,doingdoing,2007-03-03T17:32Z,I don't understand how this works. Everytime I click DOWNLOAD THIS TORRENT it takes a few seconds to upload and then shows up on my desktop as a little piece of paper with a folded edge! Help!
,mac_davis,2007-03-08T02:39Z,"You need to open those document files in a torrent program. Download XTorrent's public beta 3 and drag the file into the window. Wait :) Also, I recommend changing the preferences for seeding to go to ""infinite"" instead of ""until seed ratio reaches 1"""
,lovelystuff,2007-03-08T13:05Z,I am downloading this for a friend  - he has a MAC - how can I burn it onto DVD from my PC to work on his MAC?
,erikolsen,2007-03-13T19:42Z,"Hi - I know I make a fool of myself with this question - BUT HOW do I download this 2.08 GB - everytime  I try I only get a file on 84,7 KB????"
,|D00M|,2007-03-17T17:30Z,"my download speed is jumping all over the place, is that normal?"
,XweAponX,2007-07-14T18:52Z,"Well I tried copying the 94% downloaded files... But I use uTorrent and I tell it to ""preallocate the space"" 

Well, if you have that setting... If yo9u stop the torrent, all of the data you downloaded already... Vanishes.

But if this is the whole thing... No problem.

I hate crap that suddenly STOPS at 99.99999 percent. FUCKERS. Fuckin fuckity FUCK.

Usually, shills from the RIAA, the MPAA or, MICROSOFT do that shit... I have never seen it with MacO)S stuff. Poopity PooP and Pissity Piss!

has anyone shecked this guys otrher torrents - Not this guy here but that guy who posted the 94% - Are they all at 94%"
,XweAponX,2007-07-14T18:55Z,"Oh Yah...

I'll try burning these on the PC with ImgBurn or PowerISO... Or ALC0HOL.

One of those things ought to burn the disk... I use Alchohol to burn MacOS cds and dvds...

Will a DMG file get corrupted if it hits an NTFS partition?"
,wadadliroo,2007-09-26T16:41Z,"SEED, seed, and seed some more....pleeeze!  Need this!"
,wadadliroo,2007-09-26T16:48Z,"
Um... could someone please seed this? I am at 0.5% and showing 31 days to completion!

Thanks!"
,10mil,2008-03-09T00:43Z,"If you are stuck at 99.4% do a search for:
Adobe.Creative.Suite.2.Premium.MAC.OSX-RoME

Download the torrent uploaded on March 8 2008.

Then follow the instructions to complete your download or to do a fresh download.

All of files, including disk 6, in the March 8 2008 torrent mount and install without a problem."
