U2 participated in the reopening of the Louisiana Superdome in New Orleans. U2 had previously performed at the stadium on the Popmart Tour and at a Super Bowl half-time show, and when Hurricane Katrina struck New Orleans, it was used as a shelter and broadcast around the world when it suffered damage and became the scene of chaos. After a year-long closure and repairs, it was officially reopened yesterday. As part of the celebrations, U2 and Green Day teamed up to perform a brief pre-game show before a gridiron match featuring the hometown New Orleans Saints. The setlist was:

Wake Me Up When September Ends
House Of The Rising Sun (snippet) / The Saints Are Coming
Beautiful Day

The only member of U2 to participate in Wake Me Up When September Ends was The Edge, who also played as Green Day's Billie Joe Armstrong snippeted House Of The Rising Sun before Bono came out for a cover of The Skids' The Saints Are Coming. The set concluded with an abbreviated Beautiful Day. The audio of the concert has been made available for purchase online with profits going to Music Rising, a charity in which Edge has been heavily involved.
