Very intresting..."
,asands1,2008-12-29T18:23Z,"actually, from what i learned in medical school, meat should only be 15% of our diets.  And some people say most proteins found in eggs and nuts can give you the vitaman D.  (the vitamin only found in protein foods) 
Now for the ethical reasons why you shouldnt eat meat when you can get it from other sources is another story.  
Im tired of hearing BS from people who know absoutly nothing about nutrition giving their opnions on how healthy meat is. its not as healthy as marketers of meat and their so called scientist want you to believe it is."
,searchsnit,2009-08-29T17:37Z,"I decided to become the first person in my family to NOT die of heart disease and became vegan 25 years ago and have been perfectly healthy since. There is no nutritional requirement in the human diet to eat dead bodies and every reason to not be a corpse-eater. 

You can more reasons to not eat animals at http://www.earthsave.org/health/index.html"
,thanas1s,2010-04-11T18:45Z,"while i do not thing that eating meat is 'bad', because we are torturing innocent animals, 
we are eating corpses, mplah mplah mlpah 
 and all that Bullshit etc etc etc i have a different
approach to this. An approach that extends to 
more than just meat, but to sweets and generally 'junk food'. 

Most of us don't realize that we are fighting a 
lost fight against obesity and bad nutrition. 
After 3.000.000 years (according to the more
recent findings) of evolution in the wild we 
cant expect ourselves to be able to distinguish
instinctively between good and bad 'food'. That
is, we will always crave for the food that is bad 
for us in those quantities. Also the availability of so much cheap junk animal food which is NOT normally the case in the open nature means that
it is up to us to realize that we need to rethink 
and get to know our own selves. 

So, i try to minimize my animal food consumption and processed junk-food in general, acknowledging the fact that  a whole foods, unprocessed, raw whenever possible, plant-based diet is the best diet there is. I am not getting upset if i 'fall' and eat some junk now and then, i am not paranoid on my weight but, granted that i live alone  i do try to keep my stocks up in the house of whole, unprocessed, no-gm, bio-friendly foods so i don't resort to junk food.

People should try it, craving junk-food is one thing, the feeling of 'healthiness' that comes up when you are getting a good diet for some time
is another. Its like you are a different person altogether.
