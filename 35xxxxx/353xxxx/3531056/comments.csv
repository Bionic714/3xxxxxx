,raindr0ps,2007-06-07T23:06Z,There's nothing wrong with this file.  I downloaded this torrent over 6 months ago. It uses the Zinoku reader and it is in .exe format. Do google search for Zinoku. It  IS the best magazine reader I've ever used. I wish I could convert a lot of my .pdfs to Zinoku but it appears the site Zinoku.com.cn has been put out of business and there's no software out there to build the Zinoku reader format.

After running for long periods of time, this program does not try to access the internet as far as i can tell. It opens into an adobe acrobat like e-book reader. The software is named after the website that used to host these books via bittorrent; zinoku.com.cn
While i would rather it was in pdf format for more compatibility, i cant complain because the reader does the job. Plus this issue of playboy has Diora Baird in it 0.o
Good Download!
