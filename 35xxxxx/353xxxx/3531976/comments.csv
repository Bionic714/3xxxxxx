,nicodemus_27,2006-10-05T18:56Z,"Well, no one is seeding here either except me so bye bye torrent!"
,oister,2006-10-06T03:27Z,I will seed!  Please reseed!
,oister,2006-10-13T03:37Z,"Hi there.  Someone needs to start seeding this, as i will not be able to continue for much longer!!  My ratio is 2.36.  C'mon guys, keep up!     "
,jeldf,2006-10-18T21:14Z,"Please RESEED! I'm upping 70kBs with a 1.2 ratio having downed only 31%. Help a guy out. I want the whole thing, please. Thanks"
,jeldf,2006-10-22T23:14Z,"OK you hit-n-runners. There are two guys I see in my client and after they are done you fuckers are screwed. Get 100% and fuck off, you HnR's annoy me. Ciao."
,excelsior55,2006-10-24T18:14Z,"I've been looking for this like mad.  My son and I love it.  There are 2 seeds and 1 leecher right now.  Please stay on, there doesn't appear to be much interest (16 total downloads) but I will seed for a week after download.

Also - I know you want to drop but if there's anything you are looking for, let me know and if I have it I'll up it for you (or just send me a message)."
,excelsior55,2006-10-25T21:57Z,To whoever is downloading now at 3kb/s - you had best increase your download allocation.  This is a huge file with no demand (17 downloads over a month).  I will seed for a while but don't expect me to hang on for 3 weeks while you finish at this rate.    Don't download 3.5 gig files on dialup.
,jeldf,2006-11-04T02:42Z,"excelsior55 is right on. I'm back seeding you MF'ers and you are downloading 3kbs. 
http://www.lvllord.de/?lang=en&url=downloads
Patch your godamn system and be free. Down and up at capacity. I know you weekend downloaders want stuff for your kids. PM me and I will help you get what you want  a lot faster than 3kbs. I'm uping 60 kbs to 1 client. I won""t be here much longer. I just feel sorry for you F'ers!"
,excelsior55,2006-11-05T16:44Z,"I started seeding again jeldf, I see 3 leeches and 1 seed which I assume is you.  No one is even connecting to me.  

This is kind of rediculous.  Between the 3kbs uploads (which incidentally dropped to 1 and even 0.5 for a time before I stopped seeding) and people not connecting to an available seed with bandwidth to spare right now - I don't know what to say.  I can up at 40-60 steady.

3 gig files do not take 4 weeks.  You people need to prioritize stuff and if you can't rally some bandwidth beyond a few kbps, DVD iso files are not acceptable downloads for you.  I don't know what else to say.  

I've never seen anything like this and honestly the only reason I'm even bothering to post is because we love this series and someone was kind enough to upload the thing so I'm trying to do my part for other parents out there and not split on people (but you are making it real hard, this ain't a 20mb file here).

Rant off."
,jeldf,2006-11-05T23:15Z,"I'm with you excelsior55. The only reason I came back to seed - after I up'd 12 g's is because I know there are parents that love this show. Unfortunately, the people downloading, have no idea how to tweak their client so they're happy with 3kb's down. You seem to know what you're doing. What other kids prog's would you like? Do you use Firefox? Have you heard of the Allpeers Extension? I have a lot of kids stuff. I'll check back for a reply later. Ciao
I won't be on this much longer because of HnRs. I see someone roll over 100% and disappear and I'm out."
,excelsior55,2006-11-09T07:56Z,"Jeldf, looks like other 3 seeders and no leechers right now.  It seems to have worked out.  I think someone must have read the messages here because they were pulling 20-40 from me consistently for a while (even though I left the cap open to 60 most times).  Not sure I know what I'm doing but Bittorrent isn't real hard.

Jakers is like the holy grail for me right now.  Just a fabulous show.  I don't know that Wonderpets is ever around but my son loves it.  I have some classic Fraggle Rock, Superfriends, and Dungeons & Dragons.  Shoot me a message by clicking my username and we'll hook up.  The allpeers extension is interesting.  Never knew it existed."
,nicodemus_27,2006-11-11T11:26Z,"Hi guyz.

I'll be seeding @ 30kB for a week."
,oister,2006-11-21T21:51Z,"Hey there Jakers Fans.  I've upped 13 gigs and will continue to do so as long as there is demand.  I may not be regular, but ill keep this torrent and if i see it is dying, ill seed for a while.  

Any other Jakers dvds or tvrips would be great.  please post if you have them.   thanks,
kellen

,oister,2006-12-14T03:13Z,"Seriously, now...

Im gonna stop seeding soon... the next person hits 100% better keep it up seeding, or this torrent will die.

,_whynot,2007-09-12T18:34Z,I'm sitting at 98.9% complete here and have upped 16GB. Somebody please seed this for a little while! Only 39MB to go... I'll keep seeding after I'm done until my ratio is 10. Right now it's 4.37
,_whynot,2007-09-24T22:31Z,"This is ridiculous! My ratio is now 9.038 and after upping 33GB I still can't get the last 40MB! I will drop my upload speed when my ratio gets to 10.0 so nicodemus_27, jeldf, oister, excelsior55... somebody please reseed for a little while!"
,Nadudas,2007-10-27T12:47Z,"plzz seed, ill seed this to share ratio 10 if you do! "
,christiandominic,2008-01-24T02:08Z,"Just started this,  on 20kB down, 8up. will stick with and seed to 2.0 at least, if I can complete."
,huggy_bear,2008-01-28T20:18Z,"My kid also loves this show.

Soon as I get this down I'll seed it as long as there seems to be interest.
"
,huggy_bear,2008-01-30T09:39Z,"I'm at 88% and dl speed has dropped to about 1-2 kB/s...ain't really used to wait 1 week to get a lousy 300 megs.. I see 4 other leechers with almost 90% completed as well, hope some of them will have the decency to seed when (if) they get the whole thing."
,munk3ymark,2008-08-06T00:20Z,"Hi all- I'm stuck at 97%. If anyone can seed so I can grab the last few meg I'll keep it seeding for as long as necessary. 
Please?"
