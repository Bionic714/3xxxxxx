A Daytime Emmy-winning PBS series that actually benefits from shared family viewing, Jakers! is a captivating introduction to storytelling and oral traditions that bridge the generations. Piggley Winks is an elderly pig still young at heart. He shares with his loving grandpigs universally appealing stories from his mischievous youth on Raloo Farm in Ireland. This volume contains four imaginative CGI-animated episodes. In \\\\\\\"The Salmon of Knowledge,\\\\\\\" Piggley would rather rely on a fish with mythical all-knowing powers than study for a test. In \\\\\\\"Rock Around the Cluck,\\\\\\\" aspiring guitarist Piggley gets sound advice from his friends when his first public performance hits a sour note. In \\\\\\\"New Best Friends,\\\\\\\" Piggley, Ferny the bull, and Dannon the duck are reluctant to partner with classmates they don\\\\\\\'t know well. In \\\\\\\"A Little Bit of Something Extra! Extra!\\\\\\\" budding journalist Piggley makes up a story, and that\\\\\\\'s bad news. Jakers! gets extra credit for the casting of Mel Brooks as the lively voice of Wiley the sheep. The only thing more fun than hearing a good story is telling one. Live-action \\\\\\\"Piggley\\\\\\\'s Storyteller Playhouse\\\\\\\" segments feature actual raconteurs and performers who demonstrate their techniques (two of the four segments on this disc also appear on the Piggley Gets into Trouble DVD). Another bonus feature, \\\\\\\"Meet the Grandparents,\\\\\\\" fosters an appreciation for family heritage. Donald Liebenson
