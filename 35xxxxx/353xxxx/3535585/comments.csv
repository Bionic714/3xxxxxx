,Son Of Mogh,2006-10-08T15:23Z,Do we have to speak japanese to be able to play this game or does it have some subtitles or something? Thnx anyway.
,lancet,2006-10-09T00:40Z,"It has subtitles, so if you can read and understand Japanese, then this game won't be a problem for you.
By the way, I am not certain whether this game can operate under English windows XP or not, because my O/S is Jwindows XP."
