Troubleshooting
The Month is designed to operate on a wide range of computers, but performance will be affected by a machines speed and processing power. Prolonged use of The Month in a singe session might cause slow performance, so try exiting from the CD-ROM and restarting. On older machines, please be patient during transactions or after viewing an advertisement - a single click suffices to move between pages, though some machines may take a few moments to respond.
