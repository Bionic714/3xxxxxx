I know all their money was SO well accountable under saddams rule right, thats why we found so much behind false walls in his mansions and hideouts. We're the US. we have a gross domestic product of over 33% of the entire gdp of the world. we could give a rats ass about a lousy few billion dollars of iraq's money. you people and all your conspiracy theories."

,ccw55,2006-12-03T19:31Z,"Ha. It was the fault of the Iraqis that the US had to go over there to begin with. So it should be no suprise that they are ""charged"".

Freedom isn't free,there guy."
,Up_Load,2008-02-08T10:33Z,"ccw55, 'charged', next time you fill up your car, imagine blood pouring into your tank, then imagine that it is your mothers, or wife's or your kids. What's a poor blind child gonna do with freedom! Tell you what, why don't cut your children's hands off and tell them to be grateful that they have freedom. To have cunts like Bamimi and you living on the same soil I do make me wanna throw up."
