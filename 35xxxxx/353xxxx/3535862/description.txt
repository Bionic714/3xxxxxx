Kultiration - Live i Göteborg 1/9 2006 (Kultiration is alive)

Dåligt ljud men gratis ;)


Label says about this release
\"Kultiration is alive\" was recorded at Musikens Hus in Gothenburg 1/9 -2006
 during \"Dans, svett och dårar\", which was a 3-years-in-business-bashment
 for I-Ration Records. The performance was engineered and recorded by 
Sven Jansson at Helikopter, who excelled in making this recording sound 
as close to a regular studiorecording as possible. The band delivers a 
truly magical liveperformance that includes all their best songs from the 
past albums, but also a new, spectaculary good, song called \"Harmoni\".
