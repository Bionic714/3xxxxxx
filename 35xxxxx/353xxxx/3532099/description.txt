Project Dogwaffle Particles

PD Particles is a software program for sketching, doodling, painting and drawing with particles. It is loaded with features made for professionals, yet priced low enough for artists, students and hobbyists at all levels. If you like to draw, this is for you!

PD Particles is perfect for PC users with a passion for creativity. It is based on a standalone version of the award-winning particle painting system called OptiPustics, found also in Project Dogwaffle.

PD Particles also contains a number of fascinating natural fx brushes and can be used as a  complete, self-contained painting program. However, it is primarily intended as a companion to your existing favorite photo editing, imaging and painting tools and it is focused on the use of a particular category of brushes: the Particle Brushes.
