Just in time for Halloween, another in the wildly-successful Gartner-recommended \'Stacks of Open-Source Software on a Windows Base\' Screensaver Linux series. Virtualisation in action; it\'s the way of the future. Bake yourself a cake-tin-ful; healthier than sweets, cheaper than chocolate, but I\'m not sure whether they are better as Treat or as Trick. Both, perhaps. Source code provided so that consciencious adults can check to make sure there are no kid-unfriendly nasties lurking; see the screenshot for how to get it. (Oh. When yor screen has been saved enough, the fastest way back to Microsoft Windows is Ctrl-Alt-F and click on the red X) Made In Taiwan ; whatever happened to good-ol\' Made In USA ? Are you guys and gals going to let them run off with the crown, or will you make me a better one ?
