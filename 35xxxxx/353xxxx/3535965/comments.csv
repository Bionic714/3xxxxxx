,mad_flyer,2006-10-08T21:13Z,Thanx. I look forward to NFS Carbon here at TPB
,DeZtr0,2006-10-09T01:02Z,If you dont haw a cpu that suports SSE2 i Think the demo run! whit out a error when u start it.
,Zade911,2006-10-09T20:28Z,SEED! :D
,Zade911,2006-10-09T20:32Z,"Please seed, 0kb/s isn't great!
I really want this ;/"
[T],Knaster,2006-10-09T22:05Z,This demo was awesome i definetly gonna buy this game when it's out!
,panzerschreck,2006-10-09T23:00Z,"I cant start the game, a windows error message appears!!"
,BrillOttO,2006-10-10T08:45Z,"I also get that error, and i have got windows xp sp2, 4.3 ghz cpu and a great mother board, shoul it be any problem? 2 gig ram bu the way, and i have updated my nvivida graphic card... got damn!"
,Tantalos,2006-10-10T10:30Z,"The demo, and possibly the full game as well, requires SSE2 support, that means it won't run on socket A CPUs! So all users of Athlon XPs can't play it! That's the cause of the error messages."
,BrillOttO,2006-10-10T12:01Z,ooh... well that is total awesome!
[T],Knaster,2006-10-10T16:18Z,:) good thing then i have Intel's P4 
[T],Knaster,2006-10-10T16:19Z,I must say this game is totally awesome. Rome total war is gonna be shit in comparison.
,Threedots_dead,2006-10-10T20:00Z,"Last I heard they hadn´t decided whether or not the final game was going to require SSE2, so I shouldn´t give up yet. 
And yes, Medieval 2 rocks! Too bad the AI is so heavily scripted though. It´s hard to tell if they´ve improved the AI which was horrible in Rome.
The AI pulled some stunts on me I never saw in Rome though, so I am VERY optimistic."
,BrillOttO,2006-10-10T21:20Z,"What is it not to decide? i think many have got a amd athlon xp, they will lose customers if the y do not apply that it will work, got damn it. ffs u think they should udnerstand that, btw the game is awesome, so much better graphics than rome total war..."
[T],Knaster,2006-10-10T22:51Z,"Threedots_dead those ""missions"" in the demo are pretty much scripted since they are historical. It was the same with Rome and Medieval with the premade maps. Don't worry i've heard the AI is gonna be better than Rome and that aint so bad ;)!"
,Threedots_dead,2006-10-10T23:37Z,"@Brillotto: I totally agree with you, just passing on information.
@Knaster: Yes, I know they are just historical missions. I just wished they included a custom battle so we could evaluate AI better. And yeah, i think we can be pretty sure they´ve made it better. 
Anything else would be shooting yourself in the foot :)"
,DrSnopp,2006-10-11T17:54Z,Anyone have any info when the full game will be released?
,Tantalos,2006-10-11T21:40Z,"It seems that the beta of MTWII doesn't require SSE2!

http://www.totalwar.org.pl/indexeng.php?ShowCat=2"
,BrillOttO,2006-10-12T12:55Z,"But does it exist a demo that can support ""sse2""? I really want try it on my computer... have only seen it on my mates.."
,Tantalos,2006-10-12T22:20Z,"Well, we have to wait for the final word by CA! For the moment, there is no way for Athlon XP users to get the demo to run! This might change within the next couple of weeks, though! We will have to wait and see!

But believe me: you're not missing much! The demo is worth 30 mins of fun, not more. A fully modded RTW is much better!

Re the better graphics: they are only noticeable when you are fully zoomed in! But they are constantly a frame rate killer! Basically it looks like RTW with knights! I will purchase MTW2, no matter what. But I don't like the hype."
,Tantalos,2006-10-13T11:08Z,"OK, IT'S OFFICIAL! The full version will definitely run on Athlon XP processors (SSE instead of SSE2 is required)! "
,mylongshlong2,2006-10-13T14:40Z,"To all you Technically inept...AthlonXP (Socket A) has SSE and SSE2. Sorry to disappoint you all.
In fact the new AMD CPUs have SSE3 as well.
Oh and AMD has 3D Now and 3D Power Now! which is their own in house tech.
And in case you were wondering, AMD invented 64bit extensions to CPUs 7 Intel copied them. 

So please, in the future, before you speak about  such things, at least google about it a little."
,Threedots_dead,2006-10-13T14:41Z,"@DrSnopp: There is a bunch of release-dates circling around. No official one though yet. 
I´ve heard 10-11 November a bunch of times.
Spelbutiken says it´s 23 of November in Sweden, which sounds a bit late to me..."
,Threedots_dead,2006-10-13T14:45Z,"@Tantalos: Come on... The demo was great. I was a pessimist just like you, but I really loved it. And the graphics are spectacular. From what i´ve seen and heard so far the AI will be good a s well, so stop worrying.
@mylongschlong2: I´m sure you´re right, but how can we take you seriously with a nick like that?!?! :p"
,mylongshlong2,2006-10-13T14:57Z,"Before some fool shoots me in the back I must say that the SSE2 support was enables since the AthlonXP 2800+ (Barton core) So the 2800 and 3000 (Thoroughbred core) wont have it
but the 2800, 3000 and 3200 (barton) all have it.

You can download a little program from AMD website to check if your CPU is genuine, it also tells you microcode instruction set...but then again almost any CPU utility does."

,Tantalos,2006-10-13T17:03Z,"@Threedots_dead: well, I play mods like RTR and EB. The demo was a step backwards then (besides graphics). But as far as I know the RTR team is ready to mod MTW2 as well!"
,Threedots_dead,2006-10-16T23:56Z,"There is a new demo coming out around the 24´th. It´s from the finished build of the game (this one is form a two months old beta from what I´ve heard) so it will probably support non-SSE2 processors. And there will be ""a new battle"" as well, whatever that means...

@Tantalos. I loved RTR. If the game blows I´ll most certainly download it for MIITW, but I have a small feeling CA have hit the mark this time and made a game that is actually playable from scratch."
,BrillOttO,2006-10-23T22:01Z,"so now that it is close to the 24th can someone please link to the demo, would really appreciate it.. spanks."
,Merethic,2006-10-24T19:08Z,"It's the 24th today and the new Demo is out, those who pre-ordered at Amazon.uk.com got their activation codes. Anyone seen a torrent? Please post link :P"
,Threedots_dead,2006-10-26T14:52Z,"No, I´ve looked everywhere. According to amazon it would be released to the public two days later, i.e. 26 of October, (Today!) But I haven´t heard anything sofar. They should really stop messing around like this. Fucking capitalists..."
,Threedots_dead,2006-10-26T19:56Z,"Ok, finally, here it is: http://thepiratebay.org/details.php?id=3546191"
,BrillOttO,2006-10-29T22:31Z,"thanks threedots, really wnat to play on my own computer, at last i am able to:D"
,Threedots_dead,2006-10-30T00:57Z,Don´t mention it.
,Asian lion,2006-11-07T22:16Z,"[No point to dowload this, the whole game is in the stores]

when will someone upload the whole game ?"
,blanklikeahell,2007-08-16T14:07Z,please seed!
