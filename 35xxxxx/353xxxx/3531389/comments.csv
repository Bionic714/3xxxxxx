,blietz,2006-10-20T14:07Z,"This package is not in the original scene release form. It has been repackaged into smaller 142x50mb parts instead of original 72x100mb. There is no accompanying .nfo or .sfv files and my downloaded copy is corrupted. As no one else has complained I am assuming the resulting ISO is ok, but as there is no .SFV file, there is no way of checking which part is corrupted and as it has been repackaged, no chance of downloading and replacing the single corrupted part. Nearly 7 gig of download down the tiolet is a lot and makes me pretty mad that there is no chance for recovery."
,blietz,2006-10-20T14:46Z,Anyone to seed the last RAR ?
,blietz,2006-10-20T14:55Z,"get it here instead:
http://torrents.thepiratebay.org/hashtorrent/3516221.torrent/Dead.Rising.UNCUT.PAL.MULTI5.XBOX360.3516221.TPB.torrent"
,ersterman,2007-01-18T21:09Z,"The package is broken. Do not download. 

!   Dead.Rising.UNCUT.PAL.MULTI5.XBOX360-DRabbits-RPG\Dead.Rising.UNCUT.PAL.MULTI5.XBOX360-DRabbits.part142.rar: CRC failed in Dead.Rising.UNCUT.PAL.MULTI5.XBOX360-DRabbits.iso. The file is corrupt"
,ULTRASERVER,2007-01-24T19:00Z,"It is a shmae this is CORRUPT, and within, no indication on the RAR log as to which part is the offender.

Mebe someone has the files, unpacked, , IE: the individual RARs, that DO work to extract this huge ISO.

fingers crossed, , Croissssed,   CROST"
,mozbius,2007-09-24T10:00Z,This one isn't broken (I have been able to verify  it through XDVDMulleter...). Only thing bad about that backup is that it isn't region free and will run only on European & Australian systems... Other than that it is an iExtreme compatible image.
,DamienHell,2007-10-10T00:54Z,So does this work or not?
