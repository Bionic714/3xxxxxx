,tim_cat,2007-05-23T08:22Z,"Hey, this package is a little weird, and the instructions aren't very explicit, so here's a quick walkthrough.

Reason: You need to treat the .rar files as ISO images (disk images) instead of compressed archives. That means DO NOT extract the three files in this torrent! Use either the Window pack-in disk burning utility OR another ISO burner to burn one file each to a CDR. Here's how:

1) Insert CD into your disk drive.
2) Double-click the first ISO to burn (in this case,""Reason 3.0 CD 1"")
2b) OR open your ISO burning program and follow the directions
3) Make sure the source is from the ISO file (as opposed to other source options) and set the burn speed to whatever's going to work for you (using the properties button, I set mine to 2x to make SURE it burns)
4) Burn the CD!

Do this for all three images in the torrent, and you'll be set. Now insert the first disc, click ""Install Reason"", and follow the steps. When you get through ALL 3 CDs, it'll ask for your s/n, so just enter what's in the text file included in the reason folder of the torrent.

Ok, now for cracks. These are weird to get used to, but INSANELY easy to use. Here's how:

1) Install the app like normal, following all install instructions.
2) Copy the crack file TO THE SAME DIRECTORY as the installed app file (usually in Program Files/App Company).
3) Double-click the crack file, and click ""crack"" (some don't even need you to click).
4) Run the app.

I hope this helps! Thanks for making this great torrent available to us, too!"
