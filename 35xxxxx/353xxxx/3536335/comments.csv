Crack for the game"
,Magits,2006-10-16T12:28Z,Works 100% with my comp. Thx for uploadin! Good game i recommend it!
,Fuerza,2006-10-20T07:28Z,"Agreed. Good game - fun to play, BUT...CivCity: Rome seemed way more challenging with more options. Great Wonders was something you could build. Research advancements. Move some buildings around without having to destroy them. Build chain seemed more complex - for example - you needed a logging camp to have wood in order to build a ship builder station in order to build fishing ships to go fishing. Graphics seemed better when it came to people doing their daily activities - you could actually see a person getting into a grape vats to make wine and watch him stomping around."

,ChasingSuns,2011-08-25T19:11Z,"No problem with installing at all, but the update-file contains virus. So don't bother download this torrent."
,m2austin,2011-09-11T03:46Z,"Opened the first RAR for each CD, extracted the contents of the .bin to a temp folder. Anti-virus caught an ""infostealer"" trojan - simply deleted the file and with all files extracted, ran setup. Installed without issue. Installed the 1.11 update and then moved the cracked .exe into the Caeser IV install folder and presto - worked perfect on the first run... didn't have to do anything else (I'm running Windows 7).

The only issue I had was with that trojan - sneaky little bugger - I highly recommend you download a free virus scanner (ie. AVG) and nab and delete that guy before proceeding - deleting it doesn't affect the install.

Other than that - good torrent mixermusic!"
,djnero,2012-04-06T01:10Z,the third serial key from MrMalarkee's list worked for me
