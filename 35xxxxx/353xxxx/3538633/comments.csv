If any body finds one, please let me know!

I have looked forward to this expansion to WoW more than a year now..."
,lOrD gHoSt,2006-10-16T13:15Z,"bha, you need the english version of WoW for installing BC -.- kk wait until release :)"
,Lagerin,2006-10-16T14:23Z,Can i download The burning Crusade full when it comes out or must i buy it 2 play online??? can i use my old acount??
,Kingrames,2006-10-17T05:47Z,"What language are you guys speaking?

Also, would someone please add the north american version of the game for download? there's three torrents I've seen so far that give the european english version, but it won't work for me. :P

I just want to be prepared in case I get into the beta. :)"
,pether,2006-10-17T12:32Z,"Does Wow players automaticly remove all common sense about mmorpggaming?
1. Its a beta. Which is out more. Means there are no servers.
2. You cant host a server with the beta game only, you need the beta server too.
3. Ofcourse you'll need to buy it to play it."
,Arska6661,2006-10-17T15:11Z,Need that authencation key :(
,cool20400,2006-10-17T20:50Z,"Where can I download the Burning Crusade beta software to run a World of Warcraft- Burning crusade server?
"
,pether,2006-10-17T21:39Z,I D I O T
,hofstad,2006-10-17T23:37Z,"LOL at everyone clicking ""Download this torrent"" cuz online games u MUST buy to play the REAL part of the game.."
,Cola911,2006-10-18T20:08Z,"Hva skjer hvis vi installerer dette i WOW? Blir vi banna, politi annmeldt? HVA SKJER?

(In english)What happens if we install this to WOW? Do we get banned. does the cop get us WHAT HAPPENS?"
,pether,2006-10-19T03:20Z,Inget händer. Du kan inte göra ett skit med det.
,Tolax,2006-10-20T19:49Z,"Please stop sending me PM's regarding cracked servers - this is an annoyance, i am also forwarding email addresses and possible alias to blizzard so that they may take action regarding to people attempting to break the ToS and EULA of WoW. "
,crissiejjj,2006-10-23T15:44Z,NOOB TOLAX
,Jeder,2006-10-27T19:12Z,"Read carefuly: ""The beta download including the blizzard tracker - enjoy :)""

= 

You still need to be ""special"" and have an invite from Blizzard to the beta. That's what i decipher anyway."
,Tolax,2006-10-28T13:36Z,"Exactly, i am only putting this here for people who have an euGB invite (thats the client type) and dont like using the blizzrad downloader - i really dont blame you, this will connect to anyone on the blizzard downloader, this is the same Torrent hash, iv just added thepiratebay tracker aswell and posted it here."
,Mogff3,2006-11-02T19:13Z,"Man behöver väl inte köpa skiten för att spela online, behövde man inte med WoW iaf, så länge man har ett acc var det bara att logga in på den nerladdade WoW versionen, om man måste ha nån speciell kod för att installera BC kanske det blir lite klurigare. Annars ska det väl funka till 100% att bara installera så kan man updatera osv."
,tyos77,2006-11-11T19:25Z,"Tänkte bara säga att det finns privat servrar för denna beta version. Här får ni adressen till en av dom, direct till deras reg sida. http://darksecrets.dyndns.org:8081/reg.php
