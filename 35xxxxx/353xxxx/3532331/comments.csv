I would love you share the mesh and scenery too!!! PM if you need any help on how release on BT.

Today has been a great day!!! Tnx again mate!"
,luke97,2006-10-01T22:39Z,I forgot to mention:  I already have Godzone Tauranga and RealNZ Wanaka and Tekapo. They were shared here some time ago. Tell me if you need them.  S!
,Archon2005,2006-10-01T23:03Z,"I have those luke cheers.  I will upload the 20m mesh a bit later as I have limited  Mb usage.
What I really want tho is Flight Keeper 2.8, I havent been able to crack it yet"
,Jayhawk9999,2006-10-01T23:33Z,Req the Aerosoft HH-60 Jayhawk and Coast Guard Package?
,luke97,2006-10-01T23:40Z,"Archon, I noticed this topo scenery is a rip. The install program not simply copy the files on FS folder. Also renames some files of the default scenery of FS9. The files renamed are specified here: http://www.redbarent.com/nztopo-support.htm but it takes time to rename all the files and its not easy for newbies. Please, if you can share the next addons with its original installer or with instructions, will be better. :-) S!"
,laotazoana,2006-10-02T00:20Z,"stop upload fs2004 stuff, fs2006 willb e out soon!!!"
,Archon2005,2006-10-02T00:22Z,"Yeah I'm sorry Luke, but that was all I got provided with too, I know its a hassle, but its all I got.  I do have the installers for the rest(most) of my other scenery."
,luke97,2006-10-02T00:29Z,"Dont worry mate. Plz, share what you have. It was just a comment in the case you haven realicedabout it or someone tells ""It dont work!!"" :-) I installed topo manually and its amazing. Looking forward to 20m mesh! 76 is nice, but 20 must be a dream!! Tnx again."
,scooby321999,2006-10-02T05:38Z,"Thanks so much! 

Hey luke could you uplaod RealNZ Wanaka and Tekapo??

Archon2005: keep up the great work! If you got more (especially the 20m mesh) please share it too! :)"
,luke97,2006-10-02T08:37Z,"Sccoby, I´ll try later. I have a lot of addons sharing and I want to seed new releases as long as I can. Bandwinth is limited.
S!"
,scooby321999,2006-10-02T10:25Z,ok sure no problem! Thanks!
,luke97,2006-10-02T19:29Z,"I´ve been flying around and its amazing the difference using this topo addon. Also, the integration with other payware and freeware scenarios is perfect. I hope we can get soon the 20m mesh and other addons.
I´ve seen that Auckland and Wellington has been released by GodZone-RealNZ. Archon, by a casual, do you have them?  Tnx!"
,legendary_goku,2006-10-02T21:28Z,"Thx this is great! request:  Stearman Model 4 Speedmail!

,Accuum,2006-10-02T23:51Z,"An easy way to get around all the changing of names, is to make a copy of the whole defauly Dir before you install it then it can copy over all it likes. Just a thought"
,heyitsme222,2006-10-03T06:50Z,"I invite you all to actually stop by and BUY my scenery, and Christian's, as it certainly seems a bit creepy to be stealing it. I mean it's not as if it's all that expensive. 

""I´ve seen that Auckland and Wellington has been released by GodZone-RealNZ. Archon, by a casual, do you have them? Tnx!""

So I've just worked for 3 months to get Wellington out, living on NZ$200 per week, so you can just grab it? I fail to see the humour...

,luke97,2006-10-03T08:37Z,"That remembers me that also I dont have Real New Zealand Rotorua Airport and City. Anyone?

Scooby, Im re-seeding Wanaka and Tekapo

S!
"
,heyitsme222,2006-10-03T12:32Z,So you have Wanaka/Tekapo and Tauranga but not Rotorua? Are those the same as the early betas which turned up on Usenet?
,luke97,2006-10-03T18:10Z,Nope. I only have Tauranga. The file I downloaded from PB didnt contained Rotorua. I´ll be grateful if you could share just that one. Tnx
,[T_A],2006-10-03T20:50Z,"I just looked at some pics ,hard to believe its only 10mb
and id love to also have the 20 m mesh and some other nice NZ scenereies

and to the ""developer"" - life a bitch unless we leech"
,heyitsme222,2006-10-04T02:00Z,"""and to the ""developer"" - life a bitch unless we leech""

That's ok, I can at least be grateful that you're not out fighting old ladies for their purses...

I'm thinking of running a 'Pirate Special', Rotorua for half price for a week, any takers?"
,fergusdog,2006-10-05T04:59Z,"Well, this really is a DUD!

The real scenery isn't only 10MB its a lot bigger -must be lots of files missing

and it screws the whole place up!

Don't install this!

I think I have to think about buying the thing, some stuff looks cool, but without proper installer this is worthless. Hmm, only 30 bucks anyway..."
,luke97,2006-10-05T07:28Z,Works great. Deeply tested. Only missing is the install files. Sorry. Good try.
,thol,2006-10-19T17:37Z,what is fs2004? everybody is uploading it and don't even know what it is. please tell me!!
,r80g,2007-07-11T13:06Z,"Hi could you please upload the NZ 20m mesh

mush appreciated "
,kdev,2008-01-12T15:00Z,Robin Corn - Fuck you. I almost felt sorry for you until I realized you are a fucking kiwi.
