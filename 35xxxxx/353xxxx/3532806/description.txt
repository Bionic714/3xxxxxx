This is the best introduction to meditation i have ever encountered, and i have seen sooo many others.
Its 9 cds long and it never gets boring even once. It takes practicly no effort at all to listen to this, in fact its almost impossible to stop listening.
In my collection of spiritual/philosophical media i got many 100 gigabytes of data and
i can honestly say that Jack Kornfields stuff is kind of the crown jewels of it all. Intelligent, interesting, wise, and a lot of humour. Kornfield has been a buddhist monk for many years and also got a Ph.D in psychology. You do not at all have to be into buddhism to find this material highly interesting and valuable.

If you dont want to start meditate but want to listen to some extremely interesting lectures about psychology/philosophy this stuff by Kornfield is highly recommended:
