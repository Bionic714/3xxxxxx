,vagkap,2006-10-07T22:21Z,"!!! AND HERE COMES THE SOLUTION !!!

From the official site.

--------------------------------------------------
This is due to InstallShield not being able to replace an older copy of Installshield with the files provided in the GRAW Setup.

The workaround for this is to delete the problem folder these files are in and allow the GRAW installer to replace the necessary files.

Delete the folder ""0701"" in the following directory

C:\Program Files\Common Files\Installshield\Professional\Runtime\

---------------------------------------------------
It works fine.

(i didn't like the game though !!)"

,madhouserevival,2006-12-02T07:22Z,"I have to give this game a flat zero. No A.I. whatsoever, if you die you start in the same position and the enemies are also in the same position and do exactly the same thing. The controls are terrible (no way to switch weapons quickly) and being forced to go to menu for every single action you want to take is just thoughtless of the designers. No way to save your position, which I realize is common, but it makes you go through the same damn movies and speeched over and over and over until reach the checkpoint. This is a terrible release and it was massively hyped and the game sites have to be getting kickbacks from the game companies to rate this any higher than a 3 (I give that for the layout and scenary). Unless you have the absolute best PC system available you will be cringing at the sluggishness of this game."
