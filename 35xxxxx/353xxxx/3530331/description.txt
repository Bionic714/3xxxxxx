GROUP iNFOS

Established in March 26th, 2003, GORE
was first a dedicated metal mp3 group
but later on, we decided to release
both movies and tv-rips, and has been
quite known in the swedish scene.
From the autumn in 2004, GORE mp3/mv
was splitted into the group mwnd and
the internals will now be in the hands
of our int-grp, UbM, hope you'll
like the all new formation of GORE
and notice our shining new NFO :-)
GORE was the first group to release
a COMPLETE custom swesub release and DVD9 rls.

* We are searching for sites (non-bbb)
* Also looking for suppliers
A membership in GORE gives you alot
back, so don't hesitate to join us.
