,rush.chevsky,2006-10-11T21:13Z,"Quicktime, Videolan, any media player in Windows that uses directshow filters. Windows media player needs an mp4 splitter, an H264 decoder, and an aac decoder. G-O-O-G-L-E"

Get a clue and quit acting like a bunch of half brained morons... were you born yesterday?  Lazy ass!"
,casperboo,2007-12-31T03:16Z,"Better yet... get a real OS... something *nix based... Unix, Linux, or OS X... VLC player is the best, but it is sad that it has to be used to clean up the mess Microcrap left behind without native support for standard formats."
