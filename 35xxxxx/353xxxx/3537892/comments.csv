just because its not your genera doesnt mean it sucks. Now go play with your dolls."
,Loompa,2006-10-13T10:17Z,"yes I am going to play with my dolls and cry all day long because you bashed me so cruely! wuaahhh!  Just kidding grown up man! Whatch your mindless show I do not care, this is a free country, even kansas hickebillies have the right to live in freedom, but I have the right to speak out my opinion, because that is what our forefather fought for! lol"

I still think this show has a future..."
