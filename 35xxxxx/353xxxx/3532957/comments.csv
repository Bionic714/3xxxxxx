,irish_dreamer,2006-11-02T04:47Z,"mmeofi - You should have two choices: either Mount the image to a virtual drive (using a program like Nero ImageDrive), and install it from that virtual CD drive; or, burn the Image (not the .nrg file) onto a CD, then install from the CD drive."

PS: Eats RAM like a java-app!). This app lets you run any Windows program on your mac. If you are unsure on how-to and if-to, Google it or check wiki. Good luck"

As for the vista problem right click on the program short cut and select properties then select compatibility chose xp or whatever and that should solve it.  "

Can somebody please help me? Or please upload the program and not the disk image. I already tried to burn this a year ago eventually I gave up and deleted it. Now I downloaded it again but it still doesnt work. Please somebody help me. "
,Getado,2009-12-26T18:55Z,"Unicorn333,

you don't need to burn it to get it work .All you need is a software/application such as 'poweriso' .In 'pweriso' you will find an option entitled ""mount"" ,from there you can have the file work as if its from a CD."
,darkmind35,2010-01-13T15:53Z,"Why does this have minus points?

Confirmed to work fine on Vista 32-bit, mounted with Daemon Tools. Only the main menu text is fked up. And yeah this torrent doesn't have all the languages it tells to have."
,Unicorn333,2010-01-31T06:43Z,"Ihave ISO, but still I dont know how to open it. Does anybody know why it does not burn as a nero file anyway?!

Is this a old nero file is that why it does not work? "

,jules3000,2010-06-20T11:36Z,"Just get Virtual Clone Drive so you don't have to burn, and get ANYtoISO to convert the .nrg to an .iso. Then just extract the .rar file to a folder, look under the TALK-NOW folder inside the one you extracted the files to, and you'll see the languages in this order.

AnyToIso: http://www.crystalidea.com/anytoiso
VirtualClone Drive: http://www.crystalidea.com/anytoiso (Go to near the bottom where you see the list of all downloads; VCD is a freeware.) Mount your converted ISO before clicking a language in the TALK-NOW folder, though. Hope this helps!"
,methadones,2010-07-09T20:15Z,"NRG means Nero Image File...but we can mount it like any other Image file, I use Alcohol 120%...Works for me =D"
,myjet.586,2011-11-17T01:38Z,"Install UltraISO and you can open the nrg file directly using UltraISO or mount on virtual drive. You can also convert the file from nrg format to ISO format using this utility.
