,Geezguy,2006-11-12T17:08Z,God thing that there's alot of seeds here right now :)
,Geezguy,2006-11-13T11:22Z,"I think that ""Dynasty"", ""Unmasked"", ""Lick it Up"" and ""Revenge"" is KISS best albums ever. "
,Geezguy,2006-11-16T14:42Z,"""Carnival of Souls: The Final Sessions"" must be KISS' worst album next to ""Music from the Elder"""
,cleavagecraver,2009-02-08T21:43Z,Don't be stupid mate. Carnival of Souls was a fine grunge album. Music from the Elder was a good one too. What wasn't good was Hot in the shade!
,cleavagecraver,2009-02-12T11:40Z,Please seed!!! Getting nothing here thanks!
,MatWilson,2009-11-08T10:51Z,please seed!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
