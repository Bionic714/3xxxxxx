,Raistlin (DK),2006-10-11T17:02Z,"Well i dont mind its long, but i wanna know if there is a .nfo file containing all the above information? or do i really have to cpoy/paste the lot into a new file>?"
,hellspawn66628,2006-10-11T20:06Z,"hi as stated there is a pdf manual in the rar file which contains the whole how to and what if's plus a couple of pics etc...
i have also put a direct download to a site called my uploads.com so you can download the pdf version straight away, so you can read it before you download.

BUT seeings that Im nice i have also uploaded the softmod to the above mention site... it took bloody ages.
so here is the link to the same file butit should be a lot quicker to down load:
http://files.myuploadz.com/dl543.html
this ia the xbox softmod installer deluxe version 4.5."
,hellspawn66628,2006-10-11T20:14Z,"I am testing the http://files.myuploadz.com/dl543.html
link to see if it works, it uploaded ok but it took a long time.... so im thinking it might take a long time for it give you the run or save option when downloading.... well give it a try what you got to loose.. apart from a littl etime but if it works it should save you a load of time ...
eitherway enjoye the mod .

http://files.myuploadz.com/dl544.html
the new file still all the same software needed but you have to extract it your self, still contains manual softmodder etc .
it take a little bit of time for the file to open but when it does just click save "
