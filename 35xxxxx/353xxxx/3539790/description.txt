As expected, Mad Season sounds like a cross between Alice In Chains and Pearl Jam, taking the ponderous seriousness of Alice and PJ\'s \'90s update of winding \'70s guitar rock. Most of Above is quite somber, surpassing the meditations of Temple of the Dog in its dour tone. Staley\'s voice has always worked well in this setting, yet he frequently has had more compelling material than the webs of guitars that form the basis of Above. Much of the music on the album meanders without much direction, yet there are flashes of invention, particularly in Staley\'s work, with McCready contributing a few tasty licks. However, it commits the fatal flaw of a side project -- it sounds like one.
