,Araya,2006-10-15T18:44Z,"""However, it commits the fatal flaw of a side project -- it sounds like one."" FLAW!?! This one of the best albums, hands down, to come out of the so-called ""Grunge"" wave in the 90's. If you don't have it, grab it FFS. Layne Staley and McCready is at their best on this album."
,Araya,2006-10-15T18:46Z,"...should of course be ""ARE at their best"", sorry."
[T],Superloozer,2006-10-15T19:02Z,"I agree. If you like this kind of music, this album is a must-have. The baseline of the first track defies definition, and the rest of the track are top-notch too."
,Rocco Ruthless,2007-03-11T15:07Z,PLEASE seed this.. and I will as well when I get it.  I love this album.. been trying for it for a couple of days now.
,Rocco Ruthless,2007-03-12T00:25Z,Well.. this would have been on my top 5 downloads of all time.. kind of sucks that there isn't a single song on here that isn't cut short.  And it's in .ogg format so I had to convert to find that out..  Lame.
,Rocco Ruthless,2007-03-16T18:25Z,"haha.. ok nevermind.. the audio converter I downloaded was a free trial that only converts 60%.

Great Torrent!  Thanks!"

Thank you Superloozer for allowing me to get river of deceit again since i killed my cd from overplaying ;)   "
