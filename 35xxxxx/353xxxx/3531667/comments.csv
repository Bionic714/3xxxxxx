Get the 3 second hour-glass"
,burtbach,2006-10-05T14:25Z,THis crack works. I have the game running. It does take quite a while to start up. I do have quite a major problem with the game. For some reason I cannot stop the view rotating so I played for a few minutes and got very dizzy :/ Has anyone else had this same problem and found a fix?
,vonkain,2006-10-05T17:07Z,"i have this crazy problem the camera rotetes like hell i can't play anything 


i feel dizzy again................"
,burtbach,2006-10-06T13:43Z,Unplug your gamepad. I had a gamepad plugged in that was causing the spinning camera
