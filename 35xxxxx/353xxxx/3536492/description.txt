Ever wondered what a common man will say in a
UN assembly speech ?

Well, here it is;
You have never heard anything true as this will sound.
Just checkout the Noam Chomsky part in \"Sample.avi\"

The UN assembly was clapping for one hour after
hearing the most stunning speech in the history
of humankind; yes history was made at UN on
20th Sept 2006 by the Venuzvela president.

No one has ever dared to speak so open heartedly.
After hearing this speech one will doubt the
inexistence of GOD, I mean the way he allows
USA to kill termites and Humans.
