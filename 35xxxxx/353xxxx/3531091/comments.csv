Thanks for your help . Now I'm enjoying the game . I've already found a key and opened a door near the fountain . Now I'm searching for another key to open a gate that contains the second garden key , but haven't found it yet . Looks like I need to use a metal detector !!!!!!!

Thanks for this wonderful game !!!!! :-)  10/10"
