TombRaider 5 Chronicles Overview:

After being buried alive in the Temple of Horus at the end of Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation, our heroine is presumed dead. Friends and colleagues gather at the Croft mansion to pay their respects and reminisce over Lara's past deeds. In flashback sequences the player gets to relive four of these adventures: The hunt for the Philosopher's Stone in Rome, a deepsea dive off the coast of Russia in search of the Spear of Destiny, a brush with Hellspawn in old Ireland, and a foray into a high-tech office complex to retrieve the Iris artifact. Lara's fate is still unknown, but these four mini-stories helped fill the gap between The Last Revelation and TR6, The Angel of Darkness.
