,GYMMY,2007-05-05T02:22Z,Fuck the Beatles!!! Seriously overrated.
,GYMMY,2007-05-05T02:23Z,"Actually, their music is ok, I just don't see why anyone would give a rat's ass about anything they say. Bunch of liberal pussies anyways. Just sing, and shut the fuck up, I say."

,ExarMereel,2007-09-25T23:26Z,"GYMMY you've done nothing. You are nothing. You'll always be nothing. But the Beatles were something. In their music and aside their music, they were more than you or your children will ever be. Because what you are is nothingness, the Beatles are there to be noticed... while you are anything but noteworthy."
