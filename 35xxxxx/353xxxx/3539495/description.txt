Synopsis:

Lord Nor accuses Clark of treason, and wants him put on trial before Kryptonian Law. Clark is pronounced guilty, and sentenced to death. Ching tells the tribunal that there is a law saying that Clark can have a duel with Nor, and if he wins hw ill be allowed to live. When they are dueling, Colonel Cash releases a Kryptonian gas to kill Nor and Superman, but, luckily for Clark\\\\\\\'s, just before the release of the gas, Nor\\\\\\\'s men appear. Then, they and Nor absorb most of the gas because they knocked out Superman. After the defeat of Nor and his men, Zara and Ching leave to rule New Krypton, and Clark makes a final proposal to Lois. 


Noticed video aspect ratio very slightly out due to cropping, using VLC media player changes aspect to 4:3 fixes.
