,agent 47,2006-10-14T16:04Z,how come there r no ps2 emulators that work???
,iYDB,2006-10-22T17:01Z,... because of the huge processing power required to emulate the PS2. No PC today can do it. Someone holla if i'm wrong.
,pmassey31545,2008-08-09T01:15Z,Y'all are all wrong. You can't run them on GIMP computers but on nice comps with good graphics(512mb) or more and a decent processor you can.Search for this. It's note mine but it works. Pcsx2_0.9.4 With 8 Bios
