,Merihim,2006-10-08T10:33Z,"Episodes 9+10 will be combined 
and called 27Calibre for the mid-
season break in addition there will
be an extra 7-10 minutes footage
not available on the screener the
material missed deals with Snoops
and Kris's interpersonnel 
relationship and Kris's close bond
towards SNOOP so even though
everyone here is previewing the 
screener you have to keep watchinglol "
,richel,2006-10-08T10:39Z,wow much appreciated thanks
,Merihim,2006-10-08T11:38Z,"First off let me thank all who made this
possible esp. 'V'' who took the time and
risked his damn ass to buy and upload
he's the man not me// Second all the
bro's who pm me with thanks...well
Your Welcome!! that's why we do it.
In the meantime we'll let Crimson 
catch up I KNOW THERE PISSED but hey
The good news is we're takin a few days off to watch football and let them catchup..."
,chuchupocket,2006-10-08T14:01Z,"this is episode 11, not episode 10.  episode 10 is credited to earnest r dickinson, 11 is credited to brad anderson."
,Merihim,2006-10-08T15:13Z,"You know what would be helpful? If your going to correct someone at least do the freakin research! 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0782660/
apparently it's episode 11 if you dont LIKE it DONT watch it in the meantime i'll try to upp the missing episode 10 or you can just wait till the tv show airs on Sunday"
,chuchupocket,2006-10-08T15:18Z,"merihim, noone is complaining about free tv, I just thought I would give a heads up to wire fans because this episode here spoils you for the real ep 10 in the first couple of minutes."
,Merihim,2006-10-08T15:24Z,"There's also no way for me to change
the torrent title I simply cant
we got sick of waiting for someone to
upload this show so your gonna have 
to deal with a few mistakes IM FREAKIN
SORRY bout that as i dont own the dvds
im just a conduit...so that's the way it stand"
,chuchupocket,2006-10-08T15:26Z,"no problem, should have started off by saying thanks to you for uploading them at all."
,Merihim,2006-10-08T15:27Z,"I also contact TPB to change 
the other mistake and havent 
heard back yet we are dealin
with an icomplete set and since 
I dont own it i cant preview it
The scene basically sucked because
they damn well had this set and freakin
sat on it so im doing the best i can
im more worried about getting the
show out there than anything else
when it's all done and said we can 
clean it all up and make one torrent
I wish i had editing power here but alas 
i dont"
,Merihim,2006-10-08T15:37Z,"Anyway PEACE didnt mean
to sound bitchy been a long night
so this is epidode 11! Thanks for the 
catch. We have it all corrected and
hopefully all episodes up before next weekend
Then someone here can package it into 1
torrent,,,brb we're just not going to wait
for the scene anymore we waited and waited 
and nothing happened..."
,kant69,2006-10-08T15:56Z,"Many thanks again Merihim, but there appears to be another confusion. 

If this is episode 11 - and not 10 - and you've already uploaded ep. 9, how is it that you'll be uploading eps 9 and 10 together as one file (as you've indicated)? I mean, you've already upped 9 and 11 - so only, 10, 12 and 13 remain (excepting 6 which seems to be missing)."
,Wased,2006-10-08T16:36Z,"Thank you very much Merihim it is appreciated.

Sillyslap to kant69, The 2 episodes 9 and 10 will be aired together - however this is a preview where some extra scenes are not included, these extra scenes will explain some things and give clarity about Kris and Snoop.

This is NOT included in the previews, therefore Merihim can upload them one at the time and this is also why you should be on the lookout for the tv-eps when they get aired."
,dr0wnage,2006-10-08T19:50Z,get episode 6 up. and there is no midseason. there are 13 episodes and that's it. season 5 is 1 - 2 years away still.
,Merihim,2006-10-08T22:38Z,"Damn PB comment section keeps
cutting people off. There's no confusion Kant
someone was quick enough to spot the
error. I havent had the time to watch 9 0r
10 but from what im told they run together
etc. etc. This is just a mistake like i said cant 
correct the torrent name or i would. In the meantime we'll try to get our hands on 10
and complete the series by Next Weekend 
with any lucke."
,Shiftguru,2006-10-09T00:45Z,"Would be nice if the you had luck enough to complete, HBO must be pissed haha.

Great sharing mates. Keep Them Corners Huzzlin :D

And just to get it right, The first Episode 9 is episode 7? I loaded another torrent that was supposed to be seven and it starts same as the number 9 which you uploaded before they uploaded 7. So in that case we have  1-5,7-9,11 ?

Anyways peace and greets from Shift.

For you Thug lovin people feel free to join www.Thuggish.biz forum ;)"
,Merihim,2006-10-09T02:07Z,"Ja episod 9 is eigenlijk zeven en episode 10 is elf zo TPB heeft 7,8, 9,11"
,MikeJonesofTN,2006-10-09T02:29Z,"So 10 is really 11?

and 7, 8 , 9 are actually 7 8 9 right?"
,MikeJonesofTN,2006-10-09T02:30Z,i mean 8 and 9 are really 8 and 9?
,alexdagrate,2006-10-09T06:45Z,"This will all be more appreciated once episode 6 is up so we can start watching them!

Thanks to the ups!"
,duderofthenight,2006-10-09T06:50Z,http://files.filefront.com/the_wire_s04_ep6pdf/;5991416;;/fileinfo.html rename .pdf to .avi and enjoy!
,letsgomets,2006-10-09T07:54Z,"Thanks for all the episodes, I didn't even realize that 10 was 11 (now that I think about it it makes sense)

I just finished watching 6-9 & 11 and I have to say that I can't wait to see the last two episodes. This season is great."
,lemurs,2006-10-09T10:03Z,can anyone confirm that filefront link for ep6?
,longbongsilver,2006-10-09T10:12Z,"""can anyone confirm that filefront link for ep6?""
Yes it worked. Thanks Duder! Now do 10!"
,MikeJonesofTN,2006-10-09T12:34Z,"Thanks for all the uploads but 10, 12 and 13 if there is one will be greatly appreciated"
,Shiftguru,2006-10-09T14:36Z,Would be nice if someone could make a torrent out of ep6 so that we dont have to use that crappy connection ^^
,duderofthenight,2006-10-09T17:15Z,Indeed.

,zeeeeg,2006-10-11T17:40Z,"This right here is episode 11.  Episode 10, 12, and 13 are available from those sendspace links but the quality of the video makes it pretty much unwatchable."
,charteriis,2006-10-17T13:45Z,"THIS IS EPISODE 11

According to wikipedia the opening text is from episode 11.  Having just watched the entire series - I know this to be accurate.  Links in the comments to Real Media version of Ep 10"

Thanks"
,Duboix,2008-03-08T20:11Z,As far as I know it was just supposed to be 10 episodes of this last season. So this was the Grand Finale. Hard to imagine a better series will ever be produced. http://imdb.com/title/tt0306414/episodes#season-5
