,black curtian,2006-11-20T14:34Z,"nice little app. HOWEVER...it is only useful for converting files for use on your mp3 player. if you want this to convert wma files to save space on your pc DON'T....it deletes the ID3 tag then if your using windows media player it wont see then and pull them into your library. they will still play but you have to go to your my music folder and tell them to play. or get an ID3 tag editor and re-tag all that was converted to mp3. pain in the ass. so like i said it great but i would suggest making a back up of the files before converting, convert to mp3 and load your mp3 player...DON'T fuck with any files you want in windows media library.

i learned the hard way and am re-tagging like 5G of music that I recently added and converted before i figured out what the problem was.  "

,Mikeandhisdog,2007-10-28T08:11Z,"Ok jackasses. As anyone with any type of cracking skills will tell you. KeyGens are tagged by most virus protectors as being a trojan or virus. 99% of the time, it lists as a trojan. Why this is? I don't know, I don't program anti-virus. The best thing to do is run the virus scan on the actual program, leaving out the keygen. You can google serials for most programs anyway. Furthermore, just downloading a virus won't do anything until it is ""triggered"". Sometimes, running a virus scan on a virus will set it off. like the Ali virus. It downloads within a program then once it's triggered, usually by Norton anti-virus, then it changes you settings to resemble win 95, connects to the internet and downloads every known trojan out there. So, if you are pissed that your ""protection"" is giving a warning, just be thankful that you didn't trigger it."
,Makewa,2009-01-18T08:01Z,"Thanks for the Keys guys.

Works with 2.1.69 as well.

If you get a virus alert, could it just be virus-like code detected by the heuristic check?"
