The government\\\'s 2006 review into the future of the UK\\\'s energy policy was used by Blair to give the go-ahead for a whole new generation of nuclear power stations.

Nuclear power will cost the Earth, will not stop climate change, produces deadly waste and is a target for terrorists.

Nor is nuclear the answer to energy security - nuclear power only produces electricity and thus only marginally deals with our need for the services that are mainly derived from gas, such as hot water, central heating and cooling. Furthermore it plays no role in providing power for transport. So its overall contribution to total UK energy demand is small - only 3.6%.

So even replacing our existing fleet of nuclear reactors over the coming decades will still leave us needing significant amounts of energy from other sources. The only sustainable solution to climate change and energy security is to reform the centralised UK energy system. 

Currently, two thirds of the energy from power stations in the UK is lost as wasted heat up the chimneys and down the power lines because it is produced a long way from where it is required. We need to generate power close to where it is needed, allowing us to use both the heat for central heating and hot water, and the electricity for our other needs. This is known as a decentralised energy system. We also need a massive uptake of energy efficiency and renewable energy. 

Sounds revolutionary? Other countries in Europe already generate power locally and use renewable technologies as well. The result is cleaner, cheaper, more efficient energy than nuclear power - better for the environment and for all of us.
