After listening to this I have no desire to go to a Metallica concert, ever (unless I could somehow make my way to '86). This album perfectly demonstrates why Metallica should have retired 15 years ago."
,Fanacas,2006-09-30T12:49Z,"Är det här ett Live-Album, eller vad är det?"
,Jamminturtle,2006-10-01T15:19Z,"I agree.  I have heard four of their new songs where they are supposed to be ""heavy"" again, but they have lost it forever!"
,ayi76,2006-10-05T19:25Z,lame fucks they are sounding better than ever listen to new mainstream heavy instead seems to be more your type of music suckers
,Jamminturtle,2006-10-06T01:07Z,"It seems like the only lame fuck here is ayi76.  It's pretty lame that you can't form a proper sentence, let alone use any punctuation."
,nuggster,2006-10-06T14:03Z,"Ok, well schpukzo, sorry to say, but it's not the sound quality that is the big thing on a concert, it's the experience of hearing 100.000 people screaming together, still makes my spine shiver 2 years later! "
,Dmge,2006-10-06T17:08Z,Amen to that nuggster! Nothing beats live. Still makes me shiver when i thing about 70 000 lighters during a massive course of the Nothing else....
,ghog,2006-10-08T16:56Z,"I'm with schpukzo 100%.  I did in fact see Metallica way back in November 1986 as a fresh-faced teenager, and I will testify that this is not even 10% of that!!  Its like listening to a fat drug-addicted Elvis in 1980.  If you're still a fan, go ahead and download... but there's much better metal out there people!  Meshuggah, Lamb of God, Strapping Young Lad... etc.  So why would you bother with this shit?  If you really want to hear some great Metallica live material look for stuff from 1986 and 1987.  That was the real deal.  (like that show at the 100 Club in London - fucking tits! - btw, to the poster who mentioned Motorhead, there's a perfect example of a band who HASN'T lost it.)"
,dalun_87,2006-10-08T22:23Z,"Elvis died at his Memphis home, Graceland, on August 16, 1977."
,Kulturellt,2006-10-09T00:45Z,"They're slaughtering the songs. How come they can't keep a fucking beat anymore? What the hell, they make millions of their fans and don't even have the fucking decency to practice? I bet Lars Ulrich's worst nightmare is to be locked inside a room with only a drum kit and a metronome and then be told ""play to the rythm""... James voice is shot and Kirk can't even play his own shit without fucking up. And these recordings are the best they could scramble together? When you see them live you don't think as much about wether it's supertight or how it actually sounds, but sitting relaxed and listening to it like this just makes you sad."
,p|p7,2006-10-09T13:29Z,btw - Elvis lives on..
,jockeb22,2006-10-10T19:39Z,"I have been a Metallica fan since I was a little kid, 
I should never have downloaded this ablum. can't be Metallica! tell me that it's not! because this sucks!! 
James Is screaming: is there anybody out there? well the audience must be suprised how bad Metallica really are. And Ulrich can't keep up anymore, and the breadfan track what ta fuck is James singing? He is just raping up some fucking bull shit. Metallica sorry you have lost it!  "
,ghog,2006-10-11T01:30Z,"Thanks for the correction on Elvis.  And Elvis does live on indeed.

'86 Metallica also lives on... but not here!!  Face it, this is CRAP."
,ghog,2006-10-11T01:33Z,"my god sfx321... you saw the 26 september Sweden show??  incredible!!! 
I saw them in November of the same year with a baby-faced Jason Newsted.  3000 punk rock kids goin nuts.  I'll never forget it."
,Ragnarsinferno,2006-10-12T22:10Z,hopefully jaymz will start drinking again soon..
,jasono,2006-10-15T20:01Z,"Metallica sucks they used to rock, besides if you were a real fan you would buy it instead of downloading it!"
,Pingi,2006-10-19T18:11Z,METALLICA RULES! The concert this year in Latvia was Awsome!
