,cisimago,2008-06-21T03:50Z,Is anyone else getting video but no audio?  Or am I just inept :( 
,Costiputza,2009-07-23T11:53Z," Thanks for the upload though is not a good quality, is almost like the version on 700 Mb I already have. Not a good encoding, a little blurred.
Not justifying the download of a double quantity at almost same quality :-(."
