,mindset,2007-01-21T18:20Z,"why is it in 4:3 ratio?
i can't turn off the spanish subtitles which is annoying the hell out of me.
avoid this one!"
,pete512,2007-04-25T14:37Z,"Yeah the spanish subs really ruin the movie. 
I guess it could be handy knowing every line [i]in spanish[/i]...except it isn't, it's just annoying."
,vandal_tbh,2009-09-08T00:19Z,"Title says English, but whole thing is permanently subbed in Spanish.  Also, the menu is on Spanish.  WTF???

This upload sucks.  Avoid this one..."
