This is a fixed version of the improved subtitles I uploaded some time ago. 

Sorry about that, but I noticed there were several typos, errors, and timing problems with the last version, so I've fixed them now and made a new torrent (this one).

Other than that, the same things apply:


This .torrent contains greatly improved English subtitles for the movie "Get ready to be Boyzvoiced". 

The improved subtitles were made because a lot is lost in translation in the original DVD and DivX subtitles, partly because they are so 'simple', and on the retail DVD they are actually even partially broken.

These new subtitles for the DivX file are more elaborate, and so they capture more of what's being said.

This .torrent ONLY contains the new subtitle file + instructions. Read the instructions to understand how to use it.
