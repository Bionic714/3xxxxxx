,Lanix,2006-10-21T23:51Z,"This is a crap rip.
It's encoded in a way so it won't play on DVD-players. Not mine at least. I won't watch whole season 2 of Lost on my PC...

My player can play any of the scene xvid releases. This rip is just encoded in a crap way.

Sigh, what a waste of time."
,Lanix,2006-10-21T23:59Z,"These rips not only use GMC which none of the release groups do, but it uses GMC 3. The default settings in xvid encoding. Which leads to the only way to fix this is to reencode the whole shit.
Great work!"
