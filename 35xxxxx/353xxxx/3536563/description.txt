Here are Revised bats for the "Maximus-Garyopa_XTRM-HITACHI_v2_2_Stealth" package
previously released. just copy this bats over the existing ones into your drive.

The previous bats have a bug with errorlevel variable (my mistake, not garyOPA).

NOTE: If you have sucessfully flashed your drive with the 2.2 Stealth package 
NO NEED TO REFLASH AGAIN SINCE THERE IS NO PROBLEM ON THE FLASHED DRIVE. 
For new drives you flash it is better to have this revisted bats to avoid possible 
problems (NONE Reported here).

Also if you RE-DOWNLOAD the "Maximus-Garyopa_XTRM-HITACHI_v2_2_Stealth" package
from the "usual places" will contain the revised bats (Added on 9-Oct-2006).
