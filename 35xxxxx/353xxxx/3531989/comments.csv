,jollan71,2006-10-01T10:31Z,Hur seedar man?
,Tcip,2006-10-01T13:31Z,jollan71 - Du laddar ner den. Sedan rör du inte den. Medans du laddar ner så seedar man

,Tmas,2006-10-02T17:52Z,jollan71: Since you probably can't understand these damn sweeds I'll tell you. Most bittorrent clients automatically seed the file after downloading. If it doesn't don't worry about it.

,vankis,2006-10-04T16:51Z,There is some pretty cool high quality smilies and stuff in there but also lots of crap and duplicates. After I removed the obvious duplicate folders and RAR's I got 67MB left. Maybe Lillsnorrens could try a little harder next time he makes a torrent.
