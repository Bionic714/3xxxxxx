mdf2iso v0.3.1 by Salvatore Santagati
Licensed under GPL v2 or later
PS2.TMNT3.Mutant_Nightmare.mdf is already ISO9660.

also, on another note... the sfv file seems to be incorrect.. i forced recheck on the torrent and it appears to be 100%, but here's what i get when i check the sfv against the mdf...

--( Verifying: PS2.TMNT3.Mutant_Nightmare.sfv )---------------------------------
PS2.TMNT3.Mutant_Nightmare.mdf                    File too large
PS2.TMNT3.Mutant_Nightmare.mds                    OK
