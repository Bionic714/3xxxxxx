,Miiqu,2006-10-05T11:02Z,im secretly keeping my fingers crossed that you could hook your fans up with Volver too before your cycle is over
,rudolfo2,2006-10-05T13:13Z,"That would be impossible.In USA is now running retrospective with 8 Almodovar's movies and after that Volver will get into cinemas.On DVD should be out in the first quarter of 2007.I hope.Maybe Spain will put out Volver,but I'm affraid it will be spanish subs only,like most of the spanish releases."
,tdia,2006-10-05T13:41Z,can someone upload Volver?
,Miiqu,2006-10-05T17:58Z,"ah... according to http://www.play.com/DVD/DVD/4-/1871234/Volver/Product.html

,marthafar,2011-04-24T14:32Z,"There is a bunch of people leeching this, but without a seed I fear it will never complete. If some kind soul could open up for a while, many people would be grateful to complete their download. "
