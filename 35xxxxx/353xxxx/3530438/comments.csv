,VikingZombi,2006-09-28T01:16Z,"Sorry foks, bur Satan....ehhh......Ups Sadam had to go."
,naturespocket,2006-09-28T01:18Z,NTSC or PAL?
,drayd,2006-09-28T08:39Z,It's NTSC.  Maybe someone else can convert to PAL and put that one up.
,drayd,2006-09-28T08:42Z,"Hey VikingZombi,

This has nothing to do with why we went to war or Saddam Hussein.  It has to do with corrupt leaders, Dick Cheney's stock going through the roof, and greedy bastards who would rather line their own pockets than be either peaceful or conduct a war properly.  The reason we didn't go in with enough troops, is so we could go in with over 100,000 (!) contractors.  Watch the film and you'll understand why I'm sending it out."
,Bamimi,2006-09-28T15:06Z,"got news for everyone, Bush/cheney are gone at the end of this election anyways. US has a two term limit policy on presidents and they're in their second one. furthermore, they ain't going anywhere for another 2 yrs. furthermore yet, people who have power use it to make more profit, thats just the way it is. Look at so damn stupid, he used his power for nothing but making more profit for himself. didn't see his people living like kings, or even 1/4 as good as people live in the states. About time the 'freedom' fighters realized having the US around can be a very good thing for all their people, let them help and let us all become friends and live peacefully. besides y'all are mostly killing your own people anyways, how stupid is that?"
,Halbermunken,2006-09-28T18:20Z,"It's really not just about making money on the war and Saddam and WMDs had nothing to do with the neocon war. Neocons own document said that US needs a permanent presence in Iraq even though Saddam might pass from the scene, or if the relations would get better. A + Iraq is just the beginning.

Read about Project for the New American Century. You'll quickly understand what this so called war on terrorism is really about.

Iraqis say it OK to target American troops and about 80% want you out. So my question is: How are you going to win?

Perhaps that's not part of the goal at all. Read for instance Michael Ledeen quotes, he once for instance stated that destabilizing the region is perfect and that he wants total war with no efforts to put together clever diplomacy a la Office of Special plans. The children will sing great songs about us if we just go about our plans....  right. Imperialism is suddenly good?

The neoconservatives are MAD imperialist people. They will do whatever they possible can to further the wars. The only real problem they have that there's not enough military men and women wanting stand in the line of fire. And the effects of the New Pearl Harbor are diminishing, the clay is drying... "
,drayd,2006-09-28T19:08Z,"sorry guys, I gotta cut this down to about 20 leachers for a few days until there are more seeders.  My default for azureus was 50 and I have two running on two different machines.  So i'm going to crank it down to 10 each until I see at least about 5 more seeds.  So guys and gals, please seed after downloading."
,micleg,2006-09-28T20:41Z,"drayd, why don't you use a client that let super-seed? Then you won't have to cut down the number of leachers manually."
,micleg,2006-09-28T20:41Z,"It should be ""...the let you super-seed..."""
,JK76,2006-09-28T23:12Z,"Bamini: Er... although the US has a rather limited take on democracy they still hold other elections than those of the presidential office... like the 2006 Senate and House elections, which I believe are referred to above.  
You really should stop and think before typing as your 'arguments' do very little to further your cause.
Sorry."
,thatsmine,2006-09-28T23:57Z,no english subs ? would have been nice for peoples outisde usa ! (it's easier to read than to listen)
,Son Of Mogh,2006-09-28T23:58Z,"@ VikingZombi: hey VZ, I know you from your great uploads, I just want to say to you that it is a very big misunderstanding that people who were against the war or are against Bush are pro Saddam. I was and am against Saddam for sure, but I am not less against Bush or other fucked up policies. It was the pro-Bush press that created the idea that there were only two choices: 1- be against Saddam => pro war 2- be against war => pro Saddam. Well, there were and still are other choices, just choices the american policy didn't like, so they just didn't give those any chance from the beginning. Even after the fact though that Saddam is gone and US has 'won' (I hope everyone sees the sarcasm) the war, this in no way gives big money and multinationals the green light to go and fuck up Iraq just for good old fashioned business. 

@Bamini: a long time ago Bush sr. went away too, but then we got fucked up with Bush jr. So how do you know that some day another relative of Bush or a friend or a business partner will not become president? Well, by getting out the truth you can at least make their chances slimmer. But from what you write here it is clear that you don't have anymore braincells in your head than an amoeba.

@Halbermunken: Even though I am aware of the big ideals of the neocons in america, one should always watch the thin line between facts and suspicions, theories or projections. The latter give us the feeling that we already have the big picture so don't need the 'small' facts. 

But the description of this dvd gave me the hope that it will give us an overview of facts concerning economical numbers, these facts, no matter how small they look next to the big theories, are the most important for future generations when they will be writing the history of now. So, let's just all wait till we get the thing and judge the facts it hopefully gives us, instead of starting the whole mumbo-jumbo of personal views and theories.

,drayd,2006-09-29T02:13Z,"Regarding the seeding... Sorry guys and gals.  This is the first torrent I've ever posted.  I'm using Azureus on Windows XP.  What the most efficient way to get it out quickly so that seeding can start right away.  Oh, wait, I think I understand.  People start seeding immediately, right?  But, if too many people are trying to all get it from the original source, then it will undoubtedly take longer for the first full copy to get out there, right?  Also, if I have two PCs and one cable modem (with a router of course), is it best to just seed from one PC, or do both and split bandwidth?  By the way, I just doubled my upload speed by paying an extra ten bucks a month to comcast so I can get this out quicker.  (I can feel the NSA working their way towards me... and that's the whole point.  This government has gone waaaay too far.  This ain't the country I knew 5 years ago, and it ain't because of 9/11... it's because of the neo-jackasses.)"

,drayd,2006-09-29T04:41Z,"Saw this on the web from the producer of the film:

-------------------

Dear activists, colleagues, and friends,

In the months of work on IRAQ FOR SALE, one of the most shocking and troubling discoveries was how CACI INTERNATIONAL profiteered by torturing Iraqis at Abu Ghraib.  Specifically, J.P. (Jack) London, the head of CACI, took home over $22 million! 

The film has former employees, military interrogators, and reporters tell this infuriating story.  CACI sent us a nasty 'cease and desist' letter trying to stop word of their involvement in this obscenity from spreading.  Of course, we're not stopping anything, and put together a short film you can pass around in your emails and blogs instead.  Be warned, it's about torture and not suitable for children.  (or our country for that matter)

http://iraqforsale.org/video_caci.php

This story and others moved and affected people all over the country.  As I went from DC to Philly, St. Louis, Denver and Portland, I was truly overwhelmed by people's response to the film and the outpouring of energy to get the word out and take action.

There is a great deal to be done NOW.  Only 10 days remain until the Patriotism Over Profit week of screenings start.  This is our opportunity to mobilize, activate and energize as many people as possible around the issue of profiteering.  We had an impact on Wal-Mart with all our efforts, and we can do the same here.  

Host a house party, buy a dvd, buy one for friends,  give a dvd to a school, library or community center. But most importantly, get involved.

Buy DVDs: http://iraqforsale.org/buy.php
Host Screening: http://iraqforsale.org/screenings.php

Most of the screenings listed on the website are filling up very quickly and this will only intensify, so please help make sure there are plenty of screenings available to meet the demand.

As we have learned with each film, this is an opportunity to get up in the morning and do something, not just be pissed off.  And with the election only 40 days away, there has never been a better time to reach people, to make sure we help stop this obscene profiting by letting those in Washington know they can't keep protecting the profiteers who fill their campaign coffers.

We don't have Paramount or Universal Studios, and we certainly don't have Fox Studios, but we have all of you and it's worth so much more. Your energy and smarts are what have made every brave new film a success, and we turn once again to the best.

See you at a screening,
Robert Greenwald"
,wayneco,2006-09-29T09:47Z,"We need more seeders, especially the person who posted it and anyone else that has 100% of the data.

I've now seeded 10:1 (uploaded 18.7GB/ downloaded 1.88GB) but can't even get to 50% because there isn't a complete copy being shared."
,drayd,2006-09-29T18:01Z,"wayneco,

I'm providing the original of the Iraq for Sale DVD.  I've narrowed it down to about 10 people, 7 of whom have about 70% downloaded.  They should have complete copies within about a day.  I'm only uploading at about 80 kB/s, so it's taking a while.  When I first started, I had way too many people pulling it down, so it was slower then.  I think I've got it optimized as much as I can more or less.

Cheers,

drayd"
,drayd,2006-09-29T18:03Z,"Oh, and once those 7 people have their complete copies, I'm going to open mine up again to more people at a time... etc, blah blah.  wayneco, you must be on a fast network.  I'm not."
,drayd,2006-09-29T18:10Z,"Sorry guys.  Like I said, this is the first time I've created a torrent and the first time I've used Azureus.  So.... I just found the damn SuperSeeding checkbox!!!  Hopefully things will speed up."

Also, I think Pirate Bay people (bless their hearts) are working on the site because I'm having trouble uploading a fixed divx torrent and I'm having trouble downloading any other torrents."
