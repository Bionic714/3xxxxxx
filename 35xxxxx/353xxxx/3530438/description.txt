This is a LEGAL copy of "IRAQ for SALE:  THE WAR PROFITEERS" by Robert Greenwald.

Why do I say it's a legal copy?  Because on the back of the DVD, he says "SHARE THIS FILM" and GIVE copies to co-workers (anyone in other words).  The DVD jacket is included as a scanned image, so you can see what I'm talking about.  Greenwald wants everyone on the planet to have this thing.

Of course, technically he might have just meant he wanted people to buy and share and give away copies but...  I'm sure he wants this to get out there.  So, COPY THE HELL OUT OF IT, BURN A ZILLION COPIES, SEND IT TO UNIVERSITIES, FRIENDS, EVERYONE!!!  GET THIS OUT BEFORE THE NOVEMBER 2006 ELECTION!

Also,

Please SEED SEED SEED this torrent.  Get the word out.  Sacrifice a little bandwidth to take our country back.

Thanks...
