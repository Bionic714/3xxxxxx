,Wav3 CrackeR,2006-12-28T14:33Z,All versions of Limewire wants to install Java on your computer ... and thats where the frickin viruses and spywares comes from its not in the installer its the Java that ads virus on your computer .. when i installed it my anti virus got dicabled and my firewall was down .. then when i restarted the computer nothing worked. So dont install Java from Limewire files go to Javas website and download it there to be on the safe side or use dc++ or utorrent. :(

,Govanator12,2009-01-27T18:20Z,For Yazzz. Use Transmission. It only downloads your torrents. No intalation of spyware. No browser though however. you get the torrents from the net. Put em in a folder and open them
,seveneyeassassin,2009-04-03T23:23Z,ive never had any trouble with limewire until i recently deleted it any tried to reinstall it... the installer didnt work.. i am  hoping this is not the installer... anyway limewire is a good choice for p2p and i have never had any spyware trouble!
