Som du ser så seedar jag för fullt.
Om du inte får någon download kan tyvärr inte jag göra något åt.
Gnälla utan anledning kommer bara göra att jag tar bort mina torrents istället."

,MrEAZ,2010-10-24T06:17Z,"THis game even runs on Apple, Linux, Unix and the new Windoesnt 7

How? easy!

Some cool guys made it possible to play the real games, from back then, like this on (DUKE NUKEM 3D) by theyre creation of DOSBOX, it's an MSDOS Emulator, which everybody can use FREELY.

Do not PAY for DOSBOX, it is freeware!

Fedora, WinVista, Apple and Gentoo Users please chec this page:

Ubuntu Users:
DosBox is available by ""Ubuntu Software Center"""

That's an astounding observation! You're family must be so proud of your technical prowess and limitless skills of observation! I mean, you answered his question so thoroughly! It's not like you were a complete fuckwad who blew him off in a sad little attempt to belittle him or anything..."
,aratron_x,2011-03-26T01:44Z,"Atomic edition includes ""The Birth"" scenario, this was different in ""Duke Nukem Total Meltdown"" and the Nintendo 64 port.  "
,aratron_x,2011-03-26T01:47Z,This is NOT the atomic edition.
