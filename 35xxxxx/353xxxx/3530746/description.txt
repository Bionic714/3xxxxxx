This DVD is a pro shot and in NTSC around 80 minutes of Vintage Hard to Find Classic Peter Frampton. 
This DVD is from the years of 1975-1977 when Frampton was the King of Live Shows!!

This is very good footage and I would give this an A to A-. There is a couple of news footage at the end showing
 the Peter Frampton Madness after Peters comes alive sells went crazy.

In the past, I have uploaded some Roy Buchanan, Rory Gallagher, 
and I created the Outlaw DVD but I also have an interest in Peter Frampton. Peter Frampton at one time was the 
opening act for Roy Buchanan after Framptons Humble Pie days and then after Framton faded away, Framton was 
touring with Roy Buchanan once again. 

Peter Frampton never got the credit that he deserved as a great Rock Guitarist and I would say one of the best 
and a perfectionist on top of it all. Framton is also a great song writer and plays pretty darn good accoustic guitarist. 
Now, set back and watch the Guitar Talk to you!! Enjoy, Rick From Roy Buchanans Hub.
