Error message: This installation package could not be opened. Verify that the package exists and that you access it.....etc"
,gasman364,2006-10-02T03:43Z,"Works great, thanks! I used isobuster to extract all files, then used the msi file to install.  Using setup.exe results in an error message.  The msi file works perfectly, no viruses I can find, and it runs without a hitch so far."
,ayhem,2006-10-02T05:37Z,Oh WOW that's crap doesn't work either burned or mounted or can't install by exe or msi. Shitty Once got to install it the logo didn't come up clicked on it and asked me to find the  setup.exe manually. Don't waist time or bandwith here

Found this: 
If you have already downloaded theversion that doesn't work, then to get this release to work, you need to rename a file - 

(Obviously you will need to do this before you burn the ISO image. 
I recommend mounting the ISO image, copy the files to a folder on your hard drive, re-name the file & burn all files to disk.) 

\Adobe Photoshop Elements\Adobe Photoshop Elements 5..msi 

to 

Adobe Photoshop Elements 5.0 (en_us).msi 

The program will now install correctly. 

There are two other HTML files also with corrupted file names you could change also : 

\Adobe Photoshop Elements\Photoshop Elements 5.0 Readme.html 
& 
Photoshop Elements 5.0 Readme.html 

And it's actually working.

Attempts to burn yielded the same result as before the changes were made. I am now attempting to maunally burn the files using Nero. Again, thanks."

,zeegoman,2007-03-05T12:44Z,I take it on Planet Geek that all have the neccessary genes to be able to instinctively know what to do here? Here on Earth some of us need instructions! What do I do with all these files?
,SpAjM,2007-03-06T19:28Z,"ok guys, apparently most people here doesn?t like to help, so I will try to help you?

first, you have to download the files (no kidding)?

after that, you will end up with 38 files in your hard drive or whatever you put the download.

at that point you will notice that the files are ?.rar? so, you will need WinRaR to
decompress the files? 
http://thepiratebay.org/search.php?q=winrar

as you can notice what you just downloaded is a splited document, that means that have to combine all the files together in one file. this is done this way?
you have a series of files named  (ZWTAPSE5.RAR, ZWTAPSE5.R01, ZWTAPSE5.R02?etc)

the file that you need to open is the one with the .rar extention, open that file and extract them? this will extract a folder with two files in it, a zwtapse5.bin and a zwtapse5.cue? you will need this 2 files to burn or mount the image of the installation cd?

to mount the installation cd I use PowerISO, there are hundred of software like this one, but I prefer this one, so if you want to follow my instructions you will have to get it.. is a very small applications so direct downloaded or torrent it?
http://thepiratebay.org/search.php?q=poweriso

in the Poweriso software you can ether burn the image to a cd or mount the image to a virtual drive. I prefer mount the image to the virtual drive, is more quick and you don?t have to deal with burning a cd..

to mount the image just go to the top menu? 

Tools / Virtual drive / Drive [?:]   / Mount image?

and then browse to the extracted folder and select the zwtapse5.bin file and open it?

and that?s it? now you will have the image mounted on you virtual drive, just go to My computer (not mine.. yours :0)) open the virtual drive and ?voila? your installation CD

now go to the crack folder open the genkey and generate a serial key? (don?t close the genkey because you will needed later) 

go back to the virtual drive and install the software, when prompted enter the serial key and the activation code and finish the intallation.
and that all... uffff

btw sorry for my english..."
