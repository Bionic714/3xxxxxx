,FaderAbraham,2006-10-08T14:09Z,"Luke, sooner or later there's a word you don't understand. It may be unimportant but also it might be vital to the whole plot - and that kinda sucks to have missed it.

Personally, I usually watch my movies in English with English subs nowadays. I still try to get releases with Swedish subs, because I might need them and I have friends and family who will want to see the subs."

Don´t be rude to us needing the subs, why strip away the subs, they don´t take a lot of space anyway. Most people at TPB is swedish....."
