For the half of you that PM'ed me saying the CD ISO version didn't work: http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3536591/Windows_3.1_CD_ISO

I've made the original 7 diskette for downloads. Even though the ISO would have been a much easier install I had to put this up for the people that couldn't boot the ISO. 

Same instructions for the partitioning (FAT or "FAT16" only, atleast 80MB). You'll have to have a Floppy drive (3.5") and 7 empty diskettes. And unfortunately this will take from a bit to a lot longer than the CD ISO would've.

And again same thing with configuring extras like printers and USB drivers and CD/DVD identifiers and so on are available upon searching on google or ask or whatever search engine you use.

I guess some computers can't load hidden boot folders. Anyway seed and enjoy!
