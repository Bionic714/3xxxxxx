The DivX Codec takes the power of advanced digital video 
compression to the next level, encoding video at resolutions 
up to high-definition 1920 x 1080. That's right, you heard it
 straight: 1080i and 1080p, at a fraction of the file size.
 What more can we say? Wait, we almost forgot, there is more.
 Read on, dear friend, for a list of DivX Codec features.




 *  Compress digital video 5 to 10 times more than MPEG-2/DVD 
format and hundreds of times over raw digital video
    * Encode high-definition (HD) video at resolutions up to 1080p
    * Maximized performance for all HyperThreaded, dual core and dual 
CPU (SMP) systems
    * Improved support for interlaced video
    * Six carefully optimized encoding modes for balancing visual quality
 and performance
    * Automated noise reduction reduces grain and low-light noise (common
 with DV cameras) without significantly degrading the video
