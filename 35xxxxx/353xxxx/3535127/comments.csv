,Xtraeme,2006-11-04T05:08Z,"I'm having some difficulties getting this AVI to play. I've tried Koepi's XviD Codec 1.1.2 final, XviD-1.2.-127-25022006.exe, XviD-Decoder-1.2.-127.exe, the K-Lite Codec Pack 2.79 standard edition, and the combined community codec pack build from 2006-07-28. At this point I can only assume another codec is causing a conflict. I'll try to clean the box, but in the meantime a link to a decoder that's known to work would be extremely handy. 

Any help is appreciated, thanks!"
