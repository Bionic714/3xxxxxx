I'm hoping this torrent will help me to help my mom get through a difficult time in her life again.
Thanks a lot!"

,Synthesist,2011-08-07T19:46Z,'Reg Dwight's Piano Goes Pop' (1994) is incomplete...
,AsplosiveForce,2011-08-21T00:46Z,thanks
,BesseB,2011-08-22T16:32Z,"@Synthesist - So let me get this straight buddy: sonko has taken the time to upload the entire discography of an artist whose work spans four decades, for no reason other than so we can download it for free. But you still feel compelled to point out that one of those albums is incomplete. An album that is so obscure it would interest only the staunchest of Elton John completists, and which consists of nothing more than middling covers recorded for bargain bin compilations before John was even a solo performer. Have i got it right so far? 

Synthesist i hope i'm saying this correctly: get fucked. Get fucked. Once again, get fucked. Am i saying that right? Get fucked? Get fucked."
