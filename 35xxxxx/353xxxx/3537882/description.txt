I authored this DVD for dc911truth.org as a cost-effective tool to help bridge the 9-11 truth movement from the realm of the internet into the real world. Instead of leaflets, a nicely packaged DVD is currently handed out which is highly compatable with stand-alone DVD players. Anyone with a DVD burner can easily make copies no matter what their skill level is with a PC. As a result, we have observed the disk profusely replicate in the real world.
