,elf337,2007-08-23T11:18Z,I seeded this for ages and there were never any connections - musta been doing something wrong. Since then my harddrive has been wiped at least once and I don't remember where I got the file from. Sory and all.
,cfh0384,2009-09-10T01:04Z,"Whoever started this torrent is a little fucking punk ass bitch since only 91.6% of the fucking torrent has been avaiable since , jeez i dunno, lord funking knows when!!! Don't start a fucking torrent then pussy out you fucking little pansy ass faggot!!!!!!!!"

,K570,2010-06-23T05:35Z,"Why bother keeping this torrent up when you (the poster/host) is not gonna SEED YOUR OWN CONTENT! Look, either continually seed, or don't bother!"
,K570,2010-06-23T05:37Z,"BTW, I managed to get to 99.6% and would have gladly seeded for the next week, but oh well. I'll keep trying, cause while I have already downloaded another version of this game, it apparently is missing some content (extra ships or something like that). Get your act straight, or get off this site!"
,Millenium010,2010-06-28T04:39Z,Hey could someone seed? Im at 99.9% So close! NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
,K570,2010-07-02T00:08Z,"Damn, why can't people seed. I have been riding this torrent so long, my ratio is 2.245! WTF MAN, FUCKING SEED! ESPECIALLY elf337! STOP BEING A FAG AND MAINTAIN YOUR OWN TORRENT!"
