I installed the base game and it works fine without touching it. If I try to run the patch I get the message ""A program for this install to complete could not be run."" If I copy the IC.exe folder to the game folder from Addons, it fails to work."

1) Create a new text file and give it a .bat extension instead of .txt
2) Put the following line (sans quotes) in the file 
""msiexec /i c:\""path to"" IC_Patch_101_English.msi""
2) Insert the real path to the IC_Patch_101_English.msi file
