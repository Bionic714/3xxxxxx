,mtndwarf2,2006-10-12T02:55Z,"It's reportedly a downloader type trojan.  ""Downloads and may execute or install software without user permission. ""  These are very nasty, they can load tons of spyware/adware/etc onto your system.

Please stop seeding this, folks."

,JackSpencer,2006-10-12T23:32Z,"Watch out for the latest versions of AnyDVD since 6.0.5 or so. I found that they worked great.. for 21 days. Trail has expired. Uninstall, reinstall, older version, newer version (and yes, updates was unchecked and I tried several of the reg.keys and crack program). I washed the registry and nothing worked. I ended up buying the program. Be aware that this MIGHT stop working in a month..."

,webspyder,2006-10-17T18:17Z,Why don't U check it on other webbased AV scanners? There are many. One is at www.bitdefender.com and see if you get the same malware there.
