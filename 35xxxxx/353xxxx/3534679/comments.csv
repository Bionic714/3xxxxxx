Yeah, so what?  a bit slow is better than a movie that doesn't work! your shitty release is a waste of time! learn how release a movie shitty fuck!"
,qwasdf,2006-11-09T09:17Z,"Thx, works fine, as does the other one. Yes, I DL:ed them both to see what the fuzz was all about. BOTH took a hell of a long time to download tho (this one was a bit faster actually, but not by much). But BOTH work without a glitch.

BOTH have SWESUBS."
