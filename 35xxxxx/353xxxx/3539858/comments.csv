,Schlimmy,2007-01-02T21:45Z,Anyone know how to open this file? Thx!
,karl500,2007-01-03T10:20Z,"How do you open a .7z file?
You need 7-zip: http://www.7-zip.org/
You can also use ALZip(http://www.altools.net)

Anyway both 7-Zip & ALZip are freeware.

I use the 7-Zip format (.7z) because it offers stronger compression than Zip."
,Schlimmy,2007-01-04T23:22Z,Merci beaucoup!
,karl500,2007-01-05T10:16Z,De rien.

I've download the file but I can't open it, even with 7-zip or alzip!

How must I do?
Thanks a lot"
