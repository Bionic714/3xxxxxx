,Ogel Bond,2006-10-13T04:43Z,"For those running windows or already have the file, here is the code and instructions.


Name: Barbara Kloeppel
Serial: 249E-S93G-WRJ2
Set Date To: October 15 2004
Use version 1.0.8

Unplug internet, register EV Nova, then launch while holding the alt key. Set to ""run nova in a window"" and play for around 10 minutes. Quit and restart computer. Change the date back to what it really is and make EV Nova fullscreen. You now have a fully functioning copy of EV Nova!

Do not upgrade the version of EV Nova. That may make your version invalid."
,Kholdstare,2006-10-14T19:14Z,"Works perfectly. Thx!
One thing though, make sure you turn your internet off and change the date BEFORE you open the registration window. it will not work otherwise."
,Sunal,2006-10-18T05:53Z,"Alright... Im playin the game and I had the Vis Arrow, died, and now dont have its weapon anymore.  Anyone know what to do?"
,aquastorm,2006-10-21T16:03Z,I cant registrer. It says your license code has expired. What should I do?
,gandalf95,2006-10-21T17:02Z,i got it all registered but when i launched the game it said invalid cd-key
,Kholdstare,2006-10-21T21:31Z,"wow. i registered everything and it worked, but it still says i need to register. And now Capt. Hector kicks the crap out of me every time i see him. think he knows i 'stole' the game?"
,Ogel Bond,2006-10-21T23:24Z,"If you have trouble registering, try following the instructions. Remember to set date to October 15th, 2004. The date can be accessed in the ""Date & Time"" section of your control panel. Make sure you unplugged the internet (or are using Lil' Snitch to stop it from running home to mothership Ambrosia).

The bit about the ""Run Nova in a window"" is because Nova tends to lock up when launching for the first time being registered with the Barb code. This may or may not be neccasary.

Also, if you didn't download from the torrent, then check your version.

If something went wrong, then maybe you need to reinstall EV: Nova to get it working again. If you've been a responsible pirate, you should still have the zip for seeding purposes. Right? ;)"
,Flagrum,2006-10-23T19:06Z,does someone know a HP were i can download 1.0.8 Â´cause my download doesnt load
,gandalf95,2006-10-23T19:54Z,"i downloaded the game but when i open the zip file it says: Unable to unarchive EV Nova 1.0.8.zip into Desktop
(error 1 - operation not permitet.)

anyone knows what i should do?"
,Flagrum,2006-10-25T16:32Z,you need StuffIt 10.0 to unzip the .zip file
,General_Beef,2006-11-19T03:22Z,"Ambrosia is clever with their registering, try using Little Snitch to prevent the game calling home."
,Blackninja729,2006-11-20T01:02Z,"Hey, does anyone know of a site where I can find the PC version of 1.0.8? Really enjoy the game and I'd love to have it finally un-locked.
(having Hector stop raping me would be cool too)"
