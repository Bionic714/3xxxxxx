,SoCalism,2008-12-25T07:39Z,"you guys should try using VLC Media Player for xVid video files. There's a reason WMP may fuck up the audio. IT SUCKS. It doesn't sync half the xvid files right for any torrent. VLC Media Player is an amazing app and its only like 2mb or somethin. also plays .bin/.cue files and anything else. VLC will sync a file with bad audio/video if that is the case. VLC will get the max frame rate out of any file. To put it simply, VLC is jesus. WMP is satan. Get with it people. It's a new era. I bet all you windows media people still use internet explorer too.
