People please stop worshipping so overestimated american cinema. Always the same film for always the same head. Eternity of death is yours."

I've seen the movie from 1979 and I have seen this one (obviously). Both are good films and I see no point in shouting and wining that I (or everyone else who dowloads this) should be called an overestimater of American cinema?"
