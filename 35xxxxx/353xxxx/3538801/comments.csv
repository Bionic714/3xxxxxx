,CursedGroin,2006-12-24T12:19Z,"omg wtf bbq! argo28, read the fucking description! This is not the game, it's the fansite kit. That means there are lots of cool videos and pictures. This is NOT the game! They probably haven't even started closed betas yet."
,argo28,2006-12-26T08:52Z,"hi CursedGroin,

what can i do whit this kit?
about beta version Hellgate can u say anyone?"
,CursedGroin,2007-01-05T13:15Z,"This kit contains various movies and pictures connected to Hellgate: London. Some artwork are pictures with layers so you can work with stuff separately. However, there is NO game in here whatsoever!

For news about Hellgate: London and possible beta info, visit http://www.hellgateguru.com or some other fansite. You should be able to find a date for the beta somewhere around there."
,armagedan,2007-03-08T16:54Z,"juhu!!!this is the game....NOT ;-) just kidding hehe thanks for this one :-) looking forward to the release of the game ("",)"
,Gortie,2007-10-06T17:26Z,"I'm currently in the beta and I'm totally buying this game. This is by far the most fun I've had in an FPS for a long time. 

Ok, Bioshock was nice too, but this really taps into that little RPG gene I have. It's just a shitload of fun and well worth buying for me. :)"
,CursedGroin,2007-10-13T21:04Z,I don't play games all that much.. But this is one I'm definately buying. Preordered it a while ago.
,Emmus,2007-11-16T21:09Z,"It is not the game! U should download the game, install it, crack it and play it as any other game."
,Emmus,2007-11-16T21:11Z,SEED it PLS!! I need this kit
