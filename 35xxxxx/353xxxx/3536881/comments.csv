Put the Koran in the crapper where it belongs."
,Nazz,2006-10-10T15:25Z,Yes... I suppose the truth scares the shit out of some people. But lets not go there. Let`s just leech the stuff that we want and stay away from what we dont want. No need to insult other people. You might get killed for doing so.
,pilatuspilot,2006-10-10T17:08Z,"""Phx4..."" & ""Sarg..."" are showing their true religion, the religion of ignorance and stupidity. Y'all's god must be the Anti-Intelligent."

what is this ?  a recitation of the quran , the text of the quran , or...?"
,greybigtop,2006-10-10T18:46Z,"ALL religions are nonsense made by idiots in order to control morons. 
And Islam is a particularly vile and disgusting superstition and the enemy of freedom, peace and thinking.
One good thing about young muslim boys:
they love to take it up the kazoo and give head with great enthusiam.
But then again Muhammed was a serious faggot who gave up his ass to any donkey passing by and sucked dicked whenever he had 5 free minutes.
Swallowed too.

,pilatuspilot,2006-10-10T19:32Z,"So ""Greybig..."",

I guess by your kindergarden non-logic, the ""Holy"" Bible of the Jews and Christians is about born-agains doing in 10 year old girls 'under' their spiritual charge and celibate priests cornholing teenage boys who felt called to serve at the altar. ...and Pope-blessed armies raping and pillaging villages whose people who didn't believe in the ""peace-abiding"" Jesus Christ, and holier-than-thou puritans who drowned anyone who guessed correctly it was going to rain that night, ... and, ... and, and..., and....
The plethora of history's torments and current evils, all with the imprimatur of some religion, is spread far enough that no one's religion is truly sancrosanct.
The atheists just might have it right, not believing in a creed, from which all types of folly could fester upon mankind."
,greybigtop,2006-10-10T22:52Z,"Pilatuspilot you silly little boy, itÂ´s often an advantage to attempt to read the instalment one is trying to reply to, - however feeble the reply turns out to be.
ALL religions are ofcourse total nonsense invented by idiots in order to control morons.
However for the time being itÂ´s the muslim idiots who are causing by far the most problems."
,UtCollector,2006-10-11T00:27Z,Remember people. There does not exist anything that is holy!
,gomzi,2006-10-11T00:35Z,"fuk u haters, those who hate others for not having the same belief as thiers , look they made us hate them,

is that what u wanted? that all non-muslims hate u ?"
,Sargent_D,2006-10-11T03:09Z,"pilatuspilot...ah, blow me. ""Religion of ignorance,"" what a crock of shit. The evening news tells me everything I need to know about Islam. Have you watched it and seen the evil done in Islam's name every day? Maybe you're the one who's ignorant. Better yet why don't you pick up a Koran and read it, then you'll see the basis for terrorism there. Terrorists haven't perverted Islam, they represent it all too well.

And all you ""All religion sucks"" folks are cop-outs. That's right, cop outs! You can go on about how religion is based on fairy tales and the dark chapters in Christianity's ancient history, but all the major religions of the world except for Islam have moved on from mideval barbarism? You can't acknowledge the obvious truth right in your face, and that is that Islam is responsible for more evil in the world today than all other religions combined. Gutless and pitiful!"
,greybigtop,2006-10-11T12:06Z,"The fact of the matter is simply this:
ALL religons are manmade fairytales and ANY notions of a socalled ""god"" or socalled ""gods"" are merely  childish unintelligent fairytales.
If you believe in socalled gods youÂ´re a moron and have absolutely no intellectual integrity.
Unfortunately even morons can fly planes into buildings or blow themselves up, but at least it keeps the silly muslims from hanging on the streetcorners."
,MadeInKurdistan,2006-10-16T16:06Z,"Dont be stupid guys..respect other peoples..no mather what they belive. Im not a muslim, but i respect every human."
,islam333,2006-10-17T01:03Z,"Islam is the number 1# growing religion in the world, and it will prevail in the end, and you disbielevers will burn in hell for all eternity,
You people proboably wouldn't have talked about islam like this before 911, you just don't understand islam is not a rieligon of hatred or violence, but the meidia making it look like just that. 
You people are just living in ignorance just look around you, can you relly bielieve that the world just made itself, that human beings have no purpose on earth, just to kill each other and make money buy cars/houses and other luxrys.
What ever you people see in the news or on tv is all lies made up by jews to control the masses
islam is not a rieligon of violence like it is made up to be, but the only one true religon."
,athenry,2006-10-21T01:12Z,"islam333 said: ""you just don't understand islam is not a rieligon of hatred or violence, but the meidia making it look like just that.""
No, the media isn't making Islam look violent - terrorists are making Islam look violent. And it is violent.

I'd like to take a second here to declare that all muslims are heathens, and that they are all in for a really big surprise when they die and find out they were wrong about God all this time."
,bnc788,2006-10-22T05:32Z,"If you do not want to download then just move along.

I am surprised to see so much hate for religons especially Islam. You know what burn in your hate, who give a damn about what you guys think about religions or Islam, Islam is the fastest growing religion."
,lastivka,2006-10-25T08:31Z,allah sucks koran sucks fuck muslims
,steve112,2006-11-28T20:20Z,"youre all a bunch of fucking IDIOTS!!!!
 especially the ones talking bullshit about religion and islam. The only ground YOU have is fucking media. And media is the twisted shit that controlls your life and tells you whatever they WANT you stupid ignorent blind PEOPLE, and the one who recited a sura upp there; before you put up something undersant what it means!!!, that """"war"" was only defense, if they were to attack them, then defense yourself. OMG there are a bunch of idiots in this world, especially AMERCIANS!!!"
,mmoi5,2007-09-12T23:52Z,"Well ""Al's Butt Pal"", I can already see that we will never see eye to eye on the matter of Islam, but you seem to pick and chose text from the holy book to your pleasing, that in itself is OK. But what amazes me is that you try to use it to your advantage but I can assure you that it works against your motives.
So your quote from the translation of the Quran is bad?.....and why is it wrong to attack those who attack first? why is it wrong to preach not to fight unless picked upon, heck one needs not to look at the Quran for that, the western countries have taught us by example, that if a bunch of idiots blow up a building killing 3000 people, the answer is to destroy in retaliation an entire region of the planet with consequences that reach the entire globe and affect international relations for decades to come if not centuries?..... in the meanwhile, here are some words to reflect upon, examine your own prejudice prior to labeling other as such."
,Xtremetaker,2008-02-24T13:10Z,Well people Who don't like other religions should not talk so filthy about  that. Because Atleast every person has a specific Religion!!
,Be_Fair,2008-02-27T17:06Z,"Folks, 
it is rather sad to see conversations end up like this.  Regardless of ur belief, background or personal experience..conversations should never stoop to this level.

Let me declare my identity first..i'm and arab muslim, living in the US.  I have duties towards my religion as well as to the country i live in.

we all have to be FAIR....

Muslims are responsible for not living their lives according to the book and the teaching of their prophet.  

Non-muslims are responsible for taking/viewing islam almost %100 according to the behaviour of muslims and media.

We tend to dislike what we dont understand, which is OK...not all people like physics or chemestry..but we have to be fair with our criticism.  We owe to each other the honesty of INFO transfer.

Quran is not a book of science, however, it holds amazing scientefic facts that were only discovered by modern technology...so my dear brother in humanity..Muhammed was an illeterate man and Quran is not his invention.

Quran's text is very unique.  u would often find that Quran does not care too much about mentioning names, specific locations, or even full story etc..it emphasizes the incident, action, out-come.

U will find the specifics of an incident in the prophet speach and teaching.  So it is unfair to take a verse from Quran, and presented by it self.  Ask a Christian person who speaks Arabic..they would tell u that the document is incomplete.

For my brothers in Faith..
u got to keep focused.  Others will disagree with you on many levels.  The tone will even change depending on many factors.  

What u have to do is understand where they come from, and provide them the evidance.  U know %100 that this Quran is the word of God, and that it challnages all man kind untill judgment day.  

So, pick and choose ur battles.  For those who wish to have a fair, honest and educational debate...let them bring it on.

for those who chose to come out screaming, cursing, labeling just for the sake of doing so...tell them PEACE, u have ur faith and i have mine.

In the end, i wish that we can all just agree to debate with respect. 

Sorry for the lengthy response.
