,MartinL,2006-09-30T16:26Z,"CRC error on the: Vanished.S01E06.HDTV.XviD-LOL.[neet4me].part24.rar

DONT waste your time downloading this."
,Countra,2006-10-10T16:34Z,"What Vanished is really reffering to is the
Illuminati (Bavarian Illuminati, 1776.)
A new sub-genre? Maybie, cuz in Prison Break there
was this ""The Company"", remember?
The hold on charge in everything behind the scence... Well, this is a description of Illuminati
for the general public so next time somone
like me starts telling you about all this you will
just say ""aww, c'mone! That's THE PRETENDER (You know, The Centre...) you're talking about!""
Heheh...
And oh yeah, you probaly have no idea in
what i'm talking about now so why don't
you check google for it and see?
The best keywords:
# Adam Weishaupt
# Illuminati
That was all from me then... And oh yeah,
dont download this file people! You're better
off without it."
