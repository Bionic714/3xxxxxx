This is just a renamed copy of the \"the Wire Season 4 episode 6 screener\" uploaded to filefront as: http://files.filefront.com/the_wire_s04_ep6pdf/;5991416;;/fileinfo.html as announced by duderofthenight in a comment here on tpb.

I\'ve not watched the entire ep, just verified that this is indeed a screener of a Wire ep. So a) I can\'t guarantee that this is indeed ep6, and b) I can\'t vouch for the quality, but from what I\'ve seen, it looks to be a good quality SCREENER rip (so expect som funny off camera voice overs etc).

If your googlefoo enables you to find a better spoiler list than I\'ve got the patience to look for, the tagline for this ep is:

  \"Don\'t try this shit at home.\" -- Norman Wilson


(Now I even got the name right, I think :-)


This is my first upload, so let me know both if you can, and can't upload please.
