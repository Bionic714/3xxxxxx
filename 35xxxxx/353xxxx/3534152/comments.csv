If you liked Inconvenient Truth you probably would like this one too http://thepiratebay.org/details.php?id=3532112"
,01100010,2006-11-13T05:45Z,"It is quite astonishing that an American politician would do something like this. Essentially, he's blowing all the political capital he ever had by pushing this, and good for him - maybe he'll be able to get something done. The concept is an order of magnitude better than the movie, but its great nonetheless. "
,oldngrey,2007-10-17T20:38Z,"This film would make a great prestiage if it would tell you the truth about global warming , it's quick flashing scenes and ill begotten music gave me a sense of forboding and doesn't not help to convey a sense of workable energy alternatives, this film made me feel helpless and depresssed. Much of the film is with Al Gore without anyone really backing up his views , it is like a big ego trip.My conclusion is if you want a pure disaster horror film then this is the one for you, but if you want a unbiased view of global temprature change then look to the bbc horizion documentary about global climate change. the nobelprize has lost all of its meaning and prestige since Al Gore got his. If anyone believes that humans causes global warming is either ignorant or having an agenda. Al Gore does have an agenda, look at his new company which buys and sells carbon credits, instant money for nothing.The ""Greener"" religion just doesn't standup to Scientific facts. Al Gore would sell his mother for a little feel good publicity. Alfred Nobel is probably rolling in his grave over what the Nobel prize has become. The Nobel Peace Prize had lost it prestige long ago when it was given to Arafat, the father of modern terrorism.

The nine alleged errors in the film
# Mr Gore claims that a sea-level rise of up to 20 feet would be caused by melting of either West Antarctica or Greenland ""in the near future"". The judge said: ""This is distinctly alarmist and part of Mr Gore's ""wake-up call"". He agreed that if Greenland melted it would release this amount of water - ""but only after, and over, millennia"".""The Armageddon scenario he predicts, insofar as it suggests that sea level rises of seven metres might occur in the immediate future, is not in line with the scientific consensus.""

# The film claims that low-lying inhabited Pacific atolls ""are being inundated because of anthropogenic global warming"" but the judge ruled there was no evidence of any evacuation having yet happened.

# The documentary speaks of global warming ""shutting down the Ocean Conveyor"" - the process by which the Gulf Stream is carried over the North Atlantic to western Europe. Citing the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the judge said that it was ""very unlikely"" that the Ocean Conveyor, also known as the Meridional Overturning Circulation, would shut down in the future, though it might slow down.

# Mr Gore claims that two graphs, one plotting a rise in C02 and the other the rise in temperature over a period of 650,000 years, showed ""an exact fit"". The judge said that, although there was general scientific agreement that there was a connection, ""the two graphs do not establish what Mr Gore asserts"".

# Mr Gore says the disappearance of snow on Mt Kilimanjaro was directly attributable to global warming, but the judge ruled that it scientists have not established that the recession of snow on Mt Kilimanjaro is primarily attributable to human-induced climate change.

# The film contends that the drying up of Lake Chad is a prime example of a catastrophic result of global warming but the judge said there was insufficient evidence, and that ""it is apparently considered to be far more likely to result from other factors, such as population increase and over-grazing, and regional climate variability.""

# Mr Gore blames Hurricane Katrina and the consequent devastation in New Orleans on global warming, but the judge ruled there was ""insufficient evidence to show that"".

# Mr Gore cites a scientific study that shows, for the first time, that polar bears were being found after drowning from ""swimming long distances - up to 60 miles - to find the ice"" The judge said: ""The only scientific study that either side before me can find is one which indicates that four polar bears have recently been found drowned because of a storm.""That was not to say there might not in future be drowning-related deaths of bears if the trend of regression of pack ice continued - ""but it plainly does not support Mr Gore's description"".
