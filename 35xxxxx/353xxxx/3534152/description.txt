Inconvenient Truth: Al Gore's masterpiece.

Recoded from the original Cam.

Not password protected.

Not split into a dozen small rar files.

Not blocked by a passworded tracker.

And small and neat to fit on a CDROM.

Dues to those who put it together for it was from somewhere else. 

Thanks!


And of course thanks to Al Gore for the courage to face off stupidity and bullying with facts, clear cold reason and logic. 

What an achievement. 

You are *the* Dude!  


See the movie, after all the profits are donated to a worthy cause.
