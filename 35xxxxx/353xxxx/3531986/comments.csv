And the game do not start....... please help me, I really want to play this game......:("

,berw,2006-12-06T11:43Z,"@Lindus82

Go to the drive where you have the dvd(actually .iso) made by daemon (right click on it and choose ""open""). Open the folder ""Crack"" and copy the .exe from there to the game directory over the normal exe.

And, I passed the game (this file), all working well."
