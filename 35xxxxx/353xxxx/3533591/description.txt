From the NFO:

\"Windows XP JACKED_game is, at present, one of the smallest and lightest Internet&Gaming-functional versions of Windows XP in the world.  That being said, you can do very little on this operating system in terms of ?output? operations (printing, faxing, scanning, etc.; full incompatibility list to follow).  What JACKED_game does is it gets you on the Internet, and it lets you play your favorite games.\"
