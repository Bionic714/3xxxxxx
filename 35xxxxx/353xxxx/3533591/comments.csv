,HansMarius,2006-11-15T10:20Z,Isn't there possible to mount this image and run setup from within Windows? Dont have cd-r discs available right now...
,LucisFerens,2006-11-20T07:20Z,"it is surely, but you need a good old windows start floppy, I guess you can find some basic-dos floppy
if nothing else works, install win 98 and make a start floppy (it's in control panel, add/delete software, second tab). Win 98 is available here on TPB.
Boot from that floppy
type C: end hit enter to get to your C: drive or another letter to get to the drive where you have the files you extracted from the image.
Let's say for example that your setup.exe is in C:\extracted\i386 (not sure whether i386 is the right folder, it was on NT4...)
to go to that directory you do
cd extracted\i386
(cd = change directory)
Then all you have to do is type the word 'setup' (no quotes) and hit enter 
The installation sequence should start. DO NOT choose ""format the drive"" when prompted (duh).
...but that will leave a lot of junk in your drive.
The best thing to do is to have two partitions (or two physical drives) so you can store your extracted imagen on  D: and format C: when the install program prompts you to do so.
In that case, when I said C: do D:"
