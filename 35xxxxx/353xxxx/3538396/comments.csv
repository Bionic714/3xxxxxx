,disenchanted001,2009-01-23T21:51Z,thank you..... a minor miracle downloaded in 5 mins... 700kb/s... remarkable..... great to hear it again...
,iaincomp,2009-02-28T23:50Z,probably the best of ZTTs bands.  Duel is just brilliant.
,IvyDrop,2009-03-01T04:11Z,This is freakin' rediculous taking 3.5 hours to download this when it should only take an hour or less.  I don't know what causes a download from time to time (speratically) to stay at 99% for over an hour or more and keep calculating down to 0 on the time and then recounting.  It's nuts!  
,mo_martir,2009-10-05T05:11Z,Oh hell yeah!
