,Rexxxifon,2006-09-30T14:15Z,WTF is this?
,V5Spectre,2006-09-30T15:05Z,It's from the guys who made dwarwnia (or whaterver). It resembles the movie war games alot.
,V5Spectre,2006-09-30T15:07Z,"I just downloaded it and got bored after 2-3 matches or so. Also, can anyone play multiplayer?"
,zartceps,2006-09-30T15:11Z,It does not work for me for some reason.
,the_inquisition,2006-09-30T16:17Z,no MP in this release.
,Squid-Box,2006-09-30T16:54Z,"Just buy the game, ?14 isn't all that much, and it's a blast to play multiplayer =D."
,Squid-Box,2006-09-30T16:54Z,?14 is supposed to be 14 Euros.
,x100762,2006-10-01T11:52Z,"try download hamachi vpn to use the mp version of this game on ya own private ""lan"" with ya friends.. great mp-gae.."
,Hezkore,2006-10-01T22:03Z,"This game is pretty cool, and you don't need Hamachi to play it, only thing that doesn't seem to work is the server list, just go to SEARCH and select Direct IP and enter your friends IP, played with 4 people today, great fun!"
,Mirbacher88,2006-10-03T17:34Z,"Cool game, like Darwinia it has a very special style. The developers actually had War games in mind when they made this game (quite obvious but any way)

The movie is quite good, It's about a guy who at the time had all the best computer stuff from the time when the movie was made.

Because it's a bit old, the film get an amusing retro feeling. And the acting isn't bad.

The main character is a young Matthew Broderick."
,BrillOttO,2006-10-04T22:37Z,"what the fuck ar u talking about? shit is a game, and I do not know what darwinia is... However, its quite a cool game with a nice idea but u get bored of it pretty fast.."
,ticktock_man,2006-10-10T15:12Z,"its very obviously a niche game. go to gamespot and look at  the screenshots - if you arent interested then dont download, and dont bitch.

but unless you are content with every single game on the market being the traditional warcraft, half-life and diablo II clones with simply updated graphics then STFU. its a good thing when developers think out of the box, it gives us gamers a lot more to choose from rather than rehashing the same tired old thing over and over again.

that said, this is not my style of game.. but i am glad its out there.  "
,Singular,2006-10-11T13:08Z,"I've always been a fan or Introverse games.
I'll propably buy this one from steam.



Uplink and Darwinia were the previous games, btw.
In Uplink, you played as a hacker. In darwinia, you had to lead some thinking pixel-guys out of a virtual world gone bad, with viruses."
,Madzu_pb,2006-10-11T20:55Z,can u give me serial key plz?
,nutgraph,2006-10-24T22:30Z,"DEFCON is made by Introversion Software, a game developer based in Great Britain.  For more info on DEFCON go to:

,Gen3sis,2006-12-27T18:34Z,How can i make single plyr to work?
,atarigamer,2007-01-28T23:27Z,"EVERYBODY DIES! Muahahaha!

The game is pretty fun. I like to run through an all-computer demo when people come over, then when they see it and ask what it is, laugh nervously and quickly say ""Nothing!!"" and quickly alt+tab out."
,Grom619,2007-04-16T01:06Z,Can anyone give me an authorisation code? How did you guys get yours?
,AlexMiguel,2007-05-02T03:07Z,"i dont really write comments , i dont really bitch abt other ppl work but in this case and cuz i like do play defcon online , theres really no point in downloading this torrent if u cant connect to official servers , yeah , bla bla the direct ip thingy , useless to me at least . 

The game works fine , execpt for the fact u cant play online . no point in having this ! all the fun is missing 

The release group could try to make a Keygen a crack but then again i dont know anything abt that either . 

USELESS !"
,Zade911,2007-06-07T16:50Z,Seed please :)
,josh246,2007-06-16T12:53Z,"Thanks alot mate. I was just a bit puzzled how small it is. For quite a high quality game... But anyway a great game!

I finished downloading in like 4 minutes! Yippee!

Thanks again!"
,Stevo24,2007-11-12T20:56Z,Can someone give me a valid authentication key for this?? Thanks ^_^.
,Ribrown3rd,2007-12-16T00:25Z,Auth..Code please!!!!!
,patrioticparadox,2008-03-21T16:14Z,"Thanks for the upload of this amazingly fun and addicting game, but RARs man? in todays technological age theres no point. just up the folder
Thanks for the up man"
,patrioticparadox,2008-03-21T16:17Z,"yeah go to that site Dol_Cheep is talking about and tell me it is ""warez or site like that"". theres no point in going to a site that you cant even read and clicking on buttons you dont understand. just go to the developers site if you want the demo. then you know its the real deal.
aaaaaar! TBP 4 life"
,Keshicus,2008-04-22T06:03Z,"The reason its ""boring"" is because you fucks are too immersed into  games that need flashing lights and sounds and lil 3D units (nothing wrong with a RTS or a FPS) But hell this game is decent for LAN parties or if your bored in the office or in my case, school.
This is really focused on to multiplayer (CPU is too easy and boring of course) So good luck trying to find a key. I simply bought the game."
,Blue_shift,2008-06-29T07:30Z,"who put a stick up your butt?

Thanks for the upload!"
,jaaames,2010-03-01T04:54Z,Does this include the linux version?
,Louge_128,2010-03-13T03:04Z,and the serial is .................. ?
,hexeric,2010-03-14T17:30Z,i'd like to have a code too!!!
,ZettaSlow1337,2010-04-26T05:50Z,"Thanks for the UL
it was lightning fast : D
for the people who dont know how to install, you open the file from any of the RARS.
the file you open is called Defcon Win32
from there you install
then you copy the other file into the directory and it wont ask for a CD key"
,dobknocks,2011-08-17T07:16Z,"Hamachi Server in case you get bored playing vs cpu :)
