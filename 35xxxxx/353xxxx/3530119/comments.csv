,zell69,2007-09-02T15:18Z,"My client shows that at this time there's 10 persons (icluding me) that have 99,8% of the torrent completed.

Can't someone seed it please?"

,kkkxxxaaa,2007-11-01T22:05Z,"Can anyone please seed, there 15 or so of us at 99.86%. 

Thanks!"
,zell69,2007-11-04T11:50Z,Can't the original uploader seed for a few hours?
,inlv,2007-12-01T02:10Z,"i,m stuck on 99.8 like the rest"
,inlv,2007-12-03T21:05Z,"if you are stuck on 99.8 you can whatch the show you just have to open the file with vlc player
than you will see a box that says
""This file is broken seeking it will not resolve this problem "" click no and you can whatc the show
Enjoy!:) you might lost 1 second in the end but that is ok."
,s.k0v4cs,2007-12-25T13:21Z,"Hi, you can also ""fix"" them if you are at 99.8%. I used a program called ""divfix"" (easy to find if you google for it). You need to add your file then click ""rebuild index"" and it works (worked for me at least). That way you may also be able to burn them on dvd and play on a player if you wish to (haven't tried it yet).

Though for episode 19, ""Hot Water"", I've only got 99.7% and neither this or any other possible solutions I've found don't seem to work. It would be great if someone could either seed this for some time, or just start this torrent if they have episode 19 for at least 99.8%. Thanks."
,insayne,2008-01-08T20:45Z,SEED this man ..............
,inlv,2008-02-04T17:34Z,I use divfix++ great 
,inlv,2008-02-05T22:51Z,Well the first uplouder said he/she would only seed until someone other would finish the download and seed.I've been checking some other torrent sites and none of them has seeder on Complete Savages  :( That sucks 
,rgnhild,2008-04-27T18:45Z,"pleasepleaseplease seed, desperate here!!1 "
,bobbym4,2008-05-27T20:55Z,"divfix doesn't work
when i add hotwater it says not an AVI file"
,Stinaaa,2008-08-12T16:41Z,Why can't anyone seed?
,inlv,2008-09-03T02:45Z,"I have the ""Hot Water"" episode 
100% full episode :D"
,nowandthen4,2008-12-04T21:12Z,Hey please seed these 99.8 %  and i will try to use divfix
,schrism,2008-12-22T19:04Z,99.8% is the end of the line.  At that DivFix works OK on 16-18.  10 has audio synch problem and is incomplete.  19 is hopeless.
,shghgh12,2009-03-10T14:02Z,respect to all who r seeding! and those who don't-just dont be so selfish pleez!
,martinhajek,2009-11-12T12:15Z,"Or you can download these episodes from RpdShare using ""rapidlibrary.com"" as a search engine. Worked for me, cause I'm stuck on 99,8prc too.:-("
