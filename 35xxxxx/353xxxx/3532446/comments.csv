,wackopath,2006-10-02T19:21Z,"why all these fucking WGA cracks all the time?
if you have the working cracked files , which i
prosume everybody (mostly) knows, try to
make a batch file (.BAT) with these lines:

@echo off
cls
taskkill /IM wgatray.exe
ren %systemroot%\system32\wgatray.exe wgatray.exe.old
ren %systemroot%\system32\wgalogon.dll wgalogon.dll.old
copy LegitCheckControl.dll %systemroot%\system32\ /Y
copy WgaLogon.dll %systemroot%\system32\ /Y
copy WgaTray.exe %systemroot%\system32\ /Y
pause


now you must have the cracked files in the same
dir as the .bat file and run it from there...
any questions?

btw. the latest cracks are v1.5.540.0

Peace"
