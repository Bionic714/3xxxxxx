,superhumanjesse,2006-10-19T01:35Z,"heard this is about as gory as it gets, saw a poll of gory movies probably 30-40 movies in the poll and this got 8% of the votes while the second most got 3%"
,rollerbase,2006-12-05T19:16Z,"Thx for this one, have looked for it......"
,mindset,2007-02-13T16:55Z,4:3 and 1.66:1 is not really the same thing...
,bloodbath519,2008-02-19T00:33Z,"This movie is so overrated. NO GORE AT ALL!!!!! Just a lot of blood and very bad FX.Not one scene will make you cringe. Its about as gory as an itchy and scratchy cartoon. Real gore is the bandsaw scene in Intruder or the 14 inch splinter in the eye from Zombie, not this crap."
