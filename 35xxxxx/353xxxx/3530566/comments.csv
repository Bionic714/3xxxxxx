Your releases are the only ones I've regularly used for about a year or so.
Thanks for what you are doing for the scene."

Seems like the XBMC team released 2.0 today.

can you update?

Also, was wondering about the possibility of adding in the Extras tab for MC360.....places Scripts and other extras in the normally Xbox Marketplace tab

thanx!  I missed you!"
