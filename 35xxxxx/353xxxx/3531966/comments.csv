,waylandchin,2007-05-21T05:49Z,"I believe a few files are corrupted in this package.  they start out fine when you are listening, but 30 seconds to a minute in, it gets mixed in with other lessons and renders that lesson useless. specifically lessons 2, 5, 6, 8, and 11 if I remember correctly.  can somebody upload the a non corrupted versions?"

,khunflip,2007-12-06T22:57Z,"i know everything now by heart. Just returned from my 3rd trip to pra-thet-thai, but can anyone tell me if there is a next training available thru torrent with the next 30 lessons, or more difficult? 

Because all you can do after these 30 lessons is order in a restaurant, ask for the road, count and  explain where your family lives and how many children you have.

So, I'm ready for the next level :-) In about 1 year I want to live and work in Thailand. I proposed to my Thai girlfriend already, but can't define a date for the wedding yet, because i want to learn more Thai before I live and find a job there. With proper Thai I should have more opportunities than without."

Would be great if that can get included as well."
,Lonepup,2009-04-01T19:38Z,"This was an excellent torrent that I d/l a while back. Re-seeding now. Great for farang husband/bf understand Thai wife. There's 4 important components when learning a new language - Listen, Speak, Reading & Writing. This excellent course will teach you listening and speaking skills, which to me is the priority. Reading and writing can be mastered at this free website: http://LearningThai.com"
,Lonepup,2009-04-01T19:46Z,"Yes, these are .mp3 files. The lessons can be played stand alone, or burnt to a CD as a regular music CD. Each CD can fit 2 .mp3 lessons, so I made 15 CDs. Remember, .mp3 is a highly compressed file, so 2 lessons will expand to fill a CD in the native .wav format. This is easy to do, I used windoz media player to create the CD, but there are many other CD creator apps out there. Each lesson is around 30 minutes. Do a lesson each day."

I will also be putting together a supplementary guide to use with pimsleur. Pimsleur is great up to a point. It works far better if you write down and memorize the vocabulary for each lesson (perhaps using the Anki flashcard system). Also make a point of repeating each phrase over and over and over again in a loud and exaggerated manner. Speaking is a MUSCLE skill, like dancing or karate or piano. It is not a ""linguistic"" skill."
