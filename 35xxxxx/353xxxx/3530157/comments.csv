,artytorrent,2007-10-04T21:46Z,"Torrent worked fine. Installed as a VSTi for FL Studio without problem.
Only had a quick look at this, but the new red skin is really nice and there are tons of categorized presets that are immediately usable. Doesn't seem to import my old Discovery 1.5 banks, but you can install this separately, so it's no great loss. CPU usage isn't too bad considering you're basically getting a Virtual Nord Lead 2.
Nice one. Thanks for sharing."
