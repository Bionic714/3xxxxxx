IMHO, I would have liked this a lot better if they hadn't used all the names from the original legend; very strong story as a standalone, excellent, extended battle scenes, but not what those of us of the Arthurian bent would expect.

I mean, a Roman vassal?  Really?  

There's also enough slo-mo to allow plenty of time to get a beer, take a leak, etc.  Go ahead, make dinner....."
