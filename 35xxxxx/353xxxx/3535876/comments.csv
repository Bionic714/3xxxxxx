,ghrayfahx,2006-10-08T18:03Z,"Nope, I just compiled this myself about 5 minutes before posting it up. Tested and works great."
,ghrayfahx,2006-10-08T23:27Z,"Oh, by the way, this will be regularly updated as long is there is an interest. (Note, there will unfortunately be a slight gap in mid-late October as I will be out of state and away from my xbox and PC) If anyone is willing to help me with a new server or something to host these releases, please message me so we can coordinate something. I am hoping to learm more about XML editing and improve my releases even more. I am looking forward to giving back to the community that has given much to me."

,Tcip,2006-10-10T14:12Z,I think this shit is build on the v3. That crach ALL Xbox... So DON'T download this. Use: http://thepiratebay.org/user/GasGiver4711 safe and easy
,0rr,2006-10-10T15:22Z,"well, that's what I always say: gasgiver is the man."
,Tcip,2006-10-10T17:34Z,He is the best xbmc-builder =)
,ghrayfahx,2006-10-10T19:02Z,"I don't know what you're talking about. What v3 are you mentioning? I built it using the latest XDK and VS.net 2003. THat's the one that I have noticed pretty much everyone uses to compile. I am curentally using this on my 1.6 xbox the most troublesome one. I have not had even the slightest hint of a problem. This weekend there will be another build of mine coming out. Like I said, noone should have any problems using this thing."
,Tcip,2006-10-12T15:02Z,"http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3531904/XBMC-2.0.0-FINAL-FAT-T3CH - This shit, fucked up my and another Xbox. And your build is build on it to"
,xLoial,2006-10-12T21:17Z,"lol, tcip, you really can't have a clue... Whatever reason your xbox got fucked up, it's highly unlikely to be the fault of the t3ch build... That is the only build the xbmc team recommends, as it has unmodified source, and only added a few inobtrusive scripts... No one on the official support channels have reported your problem..."
,xLoial,2006-10-12T21:20Z,"most likely an error on your method if installing xbmc... read the manual at wiki.xboxmediacenter.com

(oh and I echo ghrayfahx with asking what the hell you're talking about ""v3""?)"
,ghrayfahx,2006-10-13T00:44Z,"Yeah, I just realized that he thought T3CH meant some kinda version 3. It's L33T for Tech. My version is compiled from CVS that I DL that morning. I  will have another one tomorrow the 13th as well. Look for it."
