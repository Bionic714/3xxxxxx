XBMC 2.0 10-8-2006 FahxBahx

Well, I got tired of waiting for others to finally comple versions of XBMC for me, So I went ahead and started doing it myself. I have included Team Blackbolt's MC360 Skin, and have pre-installed Manturafs' LiveMark Mod, enabling an Unofficial XBMCLive Marketplace. There are lots of other options available as well. So, Hopefully you all enjoy. Also, extract the LiveContent folder to your E: drive. That way, when you DL new trainers from Marketplace, they'll all be in the same place.
