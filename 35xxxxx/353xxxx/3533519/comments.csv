,mski69,2007-09-02T21:55Z,"Great, but when i've tried putting it on a dvd, all play fine except for the last episode, there is full audio, but the picture is frozen. The file does contain the full episode as i can watch on my pc, or put on memory card and watch in laptop. Can anyone advise as to a problem, i'm using convertxtodvd to put onto the dvd.
all help greatly appreciated. 
I've had same problem with some episodes on the series 3 torrent file too, but series one worked without a blip."
