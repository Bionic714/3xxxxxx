Synopsis 
Charlize Theron (The Italian Job, Trapped) explodes in a magnetic, Oscar┬«-winning (Best Actress, 2003) performance as convicted killer Aileen Wuornos.Severely abused and unloved, Aileen immersed herself in the dangerous world of highway prostitution...until she met Selby Wall (Christina Ricci, Sleepy Hollow), a naive girl who was Aileen┬┤s last chance at a normal life. But ultimately all Aileen understood was violence, and nobody imagined the nightmare that awaited the seven men standing in the way of her happiness. A critically-acclaimed film from writer/director Patty Jenkins.
