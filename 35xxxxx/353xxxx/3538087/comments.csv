,Christian777,2006-10-12T23:34Z,"Ultimately we have to ask ourselves if there are good muslims. Nobody in their right mind today would claim that there are good Nazis, even though there surely were many nice and hospitable Nazis and there sure still are those. In the same way there are many nice and hospitable Muslims, honoring their guests, even infidels in the same way the Nazis would honor their non Arian and non German guest during Nazi Germany. 


Obviously not all Nazis where bad just as little as all Muslims are bad people, however, by pledging allegiance to a doctrine or religion which promotes hatred, the genocide of the Jews and the destruction of all others then the followers of this religion or doctrine one makes oneself just as guilty as any of the perpetrators of this religion or doctrine. 


Now, many religions and doctrines are abused by some power-hungry psychopath to promote violence and persecution, what makes Islam and Nazism special is that these politico-religious ideologies themselves are promoting the despicable crimes and their followers committing these crimes against humanity are not acting in contradiction to their ideologies but in full accordance with them. 


There is therefore no contradiction between banning Islam and Nazism and the freedom of speech, because the freedom of speech is only limited by the freedom you allow others. Therefore if a doctrine or ideology is denying others their freedom these doctrines, religious or political are not protected in any way by our freedom of religion or speech. It is illegal to promote violence and hate against other religions or political doctrines. No change in our constitution is necessary to ban Islam or Nazism, nor does such an act of self-defense affect any other political or religious doctrine."

MOVIE SYNOPSIS
This movie is not easy to describe. The Basic Premise runs with the simple Philosophical premise that WORDS MEAN THINGS. Silly statement? Well not really. The question is - when a leader of a country speaks - how important are the words they use? When the pope speaks and says something important how easily do we dismiss their comments?

The MESSAGE OF RADICALIZED ISLAM AND JIHAD is being spread by governments and leaders of MASSIVE territories. Iran has a population of the entire Mountain Time Zone. We can no longer afford to dismiss their words.

Osama Bin Laden refers to the current conflict of JIHAD as World War 3 - If he considers it WW3 - why would we think differently? "

Selective Memri

Brian Whitaker investigates whether the 'independent' media institute that translates the Arabic newspapers is quite what it seems
Brian Whitaker, Monday August 12, 2002, Guardian Unlimited
http://www.guardian.co.uk/print/0,,4480174-105806,00.html


Evidence from Memri's website also casts doubt on its non-partisan status. Besides supporting liberal democracy, civil society, and the free market, the institute also emphasises ""the continuing relevance of Zionism to the Jewish people and to the state of Israel"".

That is what its website used to say, but the words about Zionism have now been deleted. The original page, however, can still be found in internet archives.

The reason for Memri's air of secrecy becomes clearer when we look at the people behind it. The co-founder and president of Memri, and the registered owner of its website, is an Israeli called Yigal Carmon.

Mr - or rather, Colonel - Carmon spent 22 years in Israeli military intelligence and later served as counter-terrorism adviser to two Israeli prime ministers, Yitzhak Shamir and Yitzhak Rabin.

Retrieving another now-deleted page from the archives of Memri's website also throws up a list of its staff. Of the six people named, three - including Col Carmon - are described as having worked for Israeli intelligence.

Among the other three, one served in the Israeli army's Northern Command Ordnance Corps, one has an academic background, and the sixth is a former stand-up comedian.

Col Carmon's co-founder at Memri is Meyrav Wurmser, who is also director of the centre for Middle East policy at the Indianapolis-based Hudson Institute, which bills itself as ""America's premier source of applied research on enduring policy challenges"".

The ubiquitous Richard Perle, chairman of the Pentagon's defence policy board, recently joined Hudson's board of trustees.

Ms Wurmser is the author of an academic paper entitled Can Israel Survive Post-Zionism? in which she argues that leftwing Israeli intellectuals pose ""more than a passing threat"" to the state of Israel, undermining its soul and reducing its will for self-defence. "
,giganticdeathgrip,2006-10-17T02:37Z,"Sure no problem - nice research.  You've discovered that FORMER Isreali Inteligence people are behind a LOT of the Intelligence at MEMRI.

Walid Shoebot in the film was a FORMER PLO TERRORIST.  So what.  FORMER this FORMER that on means these people are PROFESSIONALS at what they do and they understand the middle east crisis better than anyone.

Do miss the forrest for the trees.  I said in my original post that the premise behind besically MEMRI.ORG in general is that WORDS MEAN THINGS and when people in POWER say them if you don't pay attention you will only have yourself to blame later then they really do bring DEATH TO AMERICA.

I personally don't give two jack asses if FORMER Isreali Intelligence people are the ones who figured out that these people ARE INSANE AND NUTS AND WILLING TO KILL YOU FOR ANY REASON COLOR OF SKIN, RELIGION, RACE, CREED NOT WITHSTANDING.  

Just listen to them talk and you will KNOW HOW THEY FEEL.  Ignore them and when you find a knife at your throat - you will know you put it there yourself by being stupid.

ENUF now just watch the damn film and go to the wbsites and READ and LISTEN and stop pretending this is an Isreali conspiracy or some idiotic thing."
,reddove,2006-10-17T11:49Z,"There is no such thing as a FORMER israeli intelligence Colonel - they sign up for life, just their role changes as they get older. 

Its true that as a participant of the crisis israeli intelligence officers will have a good understanding of it but that doesn't mean i would trust anything they said. Its like trusting bin laden to tell us what bush said in his speeches!

Face it MEMRI is propaganda office of the israeli government - there is no two ways about it. Having said that by all means visit the site and read what they say, but always keep in mind that they have an agenda - its israels agenda not ours so dont trust anything without independent verification.

For example Ahmadinejad is always quoted as talking about wiping the zionist entity from the map but they dont show what he means by that. In the extended 60 min interview he explained that israel will disappear from the map via a referendum not a holocaust. International law demands that israel allow the palestinian refugees to return to their homes. If this happens the jews will be in a minority in israel - the next election or referendum will see the zionist state wiped of the map to be replaced by all inclusive democracy of jews muslims and christians. 

Not quiet the anti-semite he's made out to be is he? Perhaps that why Mike Wallace, a jew, said in the radio interview said he did not think ahmadinejad was anti-semetic. 

http://hotair.com/archives/2006/08/11/audio-mike-and-mahmoud/

Pehaps this is also why cbs news showed holocaust surviver Rabbis hugging ahmadinejad and saying that they would pray for him.

,greatfugazi,2006-11-01T05:06Z,"Shouldn't we deal with the Tyrrany here in the US before we concentrate on the Tyranny 13,000 miles away?  The Bush Administration is tyrannical.  Isn't that a lot closer to home?  I mean here is a governement that attacked without just cause a sovereign nation in contravention of the UN Charter and International law.  This same administration, in contravention of the Geneva Conventions (even the Nazi's followed the rules of war...at least with the western powers) by torturing prisoners and then tried to justify it.  This same administration along with the rest of the Republican Party just effectively struck down the Posse Comitatus Act and Habeus Corpus on the very same day no less, 27 Oct. 06 when Dear Leader signed the Military Commissions Act (Habeus Corpus RIP) and the John Warner Defense Authorization Act (The Insurrection Act  RIP).  These together are a leap towards the Enabling Act of 1934.  BTW, also in the latter act were appropriations for KBR to build concentration camps for tens of thousands of detainess......so....which do you fear more?  Some guy in a cave in Pakistan wearing dirty laundry on his head or the idiot tyrant wannabe whom, I am guessing, a number of the people seeing this voted for and, laughably (while crying on the inside of course) would vote for again.  Wake up, your democracy is burning."
,TechStud,2006-11-06T21:11Z,"GreatFugazi-
Go watch the movie again and quit whining about our political system in the comments section for this torrent.  Your comment would go better under the Fahrenheit 911 movie since it sounds like you crawled from the spuge of Michael Moore anyway.  Do your homework and you will see that everyone wanted to go into Iraq including most members of both houses of congress.  We were pissed as a nation and someone needed to get their ass kicked.  Saddam and Iraq were convenient targets.  Yes, private companies are making money off the war.  I'm sure you are just jealous that you are not getting your share, but the truth is that it has been going on in other wars, long before the Bush administration was in office and unless ""we the people"" do something about the ethics of our elected leaders it will continue to go on and, no doubt, get worse.

Our political system is seriously corrupt.  Republican, Democrat... You pick a side.  That's what you are supposed to do, right?  Then you feel like you have a voice and are part of the political system.  It's all part of the smoke and mirrors that we call democracy that is actually cover for a political system ruled by capitalism and greed.

I have a friend who was in the CIA for 33 years.  His last post was director of cyber counter terrorism. Recently, after his retirement I had a chance to talk with him in depth about some of the big players in Washington.  In a nut shell, he let me know that we have reached a point, and have been there for awhile, that it truly does not matter which party is in control or who we vote for.  What's going to happen will happen.  The system is broke and he really doesn't know what it is going to take to fix it but he did say that it is going to take something catastrophic to change our course.

Anyway, my point is, stop the status quo of taking one side and blaming the other.  The strife is what blinds you to the truth.  The same as the hatred and ""struggle with the west"" the radical Muslims in this documentary preach continually.  Instead place the blame on the entire system where it belongs and get involved in ground roots movement to start taking our government back and finally working for the our people and the world.

,Hasnain,2006-11-20T00:02Z,"Christian777??? That's way too extreme and prejudice. Hard to believe Jesus pbuh would agree with what you're saying.

Islam and Nazizm??? Excuse me but 

Allah swt in the Qu'ran says:
""No arab is superior than a non-arab, no non arab is superior to an arab."" 

As well as the fact that Muslims are allowed to marry Jews and Christians. 

In Islam, several things are clear:

Suicide is forbidden.  ""O ye who believe!... 

do not] kill yourselves, for truly Allah has been to you Most Merciful.  If any do that in rancour and injustice, soon shall We cast him into the Fire..."" (Qur'an 4:29-30).

The taking of life is allowed only by way of justice (i.e. the death penalty for murder), but even then, forgiveness is better.  ""Nor take life - which Allah has made sacred - except for just cause..."" (17:33).

Christian777, you probaby don't know 1 muslim in real life and here you are judging them on the net, based from what other individuals do.

If a Christian priest is charged with paedophile related crimes should we consider Christianity a religion for Child Molesters???

You all people need to do some reading and in CONTEXT. That means that you shouldn't just read on sentence out of the Qu'ran and think that's all there's to it. 

So keep away from FOXNEWS for a while and do some real reading, hit the liabrary and judge for yourself."

PRO-WESTERN PROPAGANDA FILM!!

  It portrays people with insignificant qualifications as experts and their opinions and theories as truths.  The film attacks Islam for portraying the USA and the west as evil aggressors (and why should they?--I mean our numberous military bases all over the world and our disinterest in the opinions of other world powers as to our military actions; Afghanistan, and the invasion of the Nation of Iraq, where there were no Al quiada or WMAs....)

and i mean, have any of you seen fox news or any other media in the past 7 years??  how do/did we portray muslims, islam, afghanistan, Iraq, Iran.....coincidentaly all nations who support islam and who have natural resources we desire....  We dont seem to mind the dictators in south america(who WE installed) or the corruption, dictatorships and daily bloodbaths throughout africa...(i mean what do they have to offer?)

i mean this whole Islam-nazi connection is exactly the accusation and connection the media in Europe, south america, Asia, and the middle east make with the USA and Nazi germany..or more specifically, bush and hitler....

i laughed a lot during this movie but where are the actually facts and references? hmmmm

Palestine is terrorized DAILY by the Isreali  military...Daily...schools are destroyed, and women and children are shot at.
any of you know the history of Isreal, Palestine and the gaza strip?? might be a good time to do some research...if you did you would know why Palestinians and the rest of the Muslim world despises israel.

I think it's sad that some people don't know when 911 happened, when it was so recent. Also, the lack of caring of the american public. The PC of america is allowing these people to be in our country, burning flags and rallying our own citizens against us. They are using the justice system to escape from the punishment they deserve, and they live in great places with their families. They actually control(own) whole towns in the U.S. 

Can you say assimilation? It's very possible that we can be torn apart from the inside, when we don't know our enemy, and they can waltz right into the country and not get in trouble because they gain the rights from our country.

They (can) have agents all over the country. A signal and they can be activated. This is already proven true to be possible in korea, as north korea has many sleeper agents in south korea and japan.

Isn't it a sad day in america, when you see teens burn their own nation's flag? Laughing, flipping it off and stomping on it? Where has america gone to? And how's it gonna be in the future? Noone(not everyone literally) is really proud to be an american anymore, and we all take too much advantage of the system, that it's allowed all this to happen. We're too afraid of getting sued that we have all these rediculous policies that allow these things to happen.

The media is horrible. You should never trust your news station for good news. all they talk about is the bad things happening. US military bombs wrong target, US military tortures prisoners. You never hear of the good things that happen. You can find pictures of US soldiers taking care of children over there, and working together. You'll never see that on the news. Why? cause it's not interesting to see good things happening in the world. And the media is so extremely bias. Oh, and have you seen iraqi torture? That's shit makes what that soldier did look like child's play. When you think about it, she did shit frat houses in the u.s. does.

Put urself in a soldiers shoes. How would you feel if u came back home to a country that didn't welcome you back. That doesnt appreciate what you've done for them. They VOLUNTEERED to fight for your country. If they didn't, can we say draft? I actually would be happy if they reinstated the draft. Maybe then people would care more. No, we'd protest and complain. Other countries have required drafts for 2+years. If they were going to college, they can put it off for a few years, but they still had to go through it.

Oh, btw we don't control most of our ports and mexico is such an easy border to cross. Why? cause our government allowed them to be sold off. why? MONEY. Money runs this country. We are THE outsource country. We fund china's military. Remember that when you buy stuff from places like wal-mart, where most of it is made in china. 

And they remind you in the beginning that it's the radicalists, not all muslims. Most muslims are like us, they just wanna live out their lives. The muslims are actually very accepting people, as long as you believe in the one true God. But they have groups that interpret the Qur'an as that they must rid the world of infedels, including christians and jews, and those are the ones we are trying to fight. And the fact that anyone and anybody can be the enemy is not helpful. People that are normal everyday citizens in their nation can/are the very people we are fighting. We can invade a town and the citizens can be all happy/thankful that we did and then throw a 360 and kill many of the troops when they lower their guard. Or while we're invading, they can be walking along and pull out an ak.

There's actually events where US troops are on convoys and there are children in the road. Naturally we'll wanna slow down and not hurt them, but suddenly crowds of them will come out and toss grenades into the vehicles. And you wonder why their children our dieing? It's "

Those who say it is not the religion, but just some of the Muslims are wrong. It is the religion and despite of this there are still sensible and moderate Muslims. These are the people giving Islam a friendly face. A face it doesn't deserve. Islam is nothing but hatred and robbery of freedom."

,Wake_Up.,2008-10-24T14:56Z,"This is Islam. What Muslims are doing in Darfur.

Halima Bashir is a survivor. She was tortured and gang-raped for days as a punishment for speaking out about an attack on primary school children in Darfur.

Her crime was to tell people that a group of Janjaweed militia and government soldiers had attacked the primary school for girls, raping pupils as young as eight. She paid a terrible personal price.

""They were aged between 8 and 13,"" she said. ""They were in shock, bleeding, screaming and crying. It was horrific. Because I told people what happened, the authorities arrested me. They said, 'We will show you what rape is'. They beat me severely. At night, three men raped me.
""The following day the same thing, different men. Torture and rape, every day, torture and rape.""

In five 5 cases, women described that the rapists abducted them and held them captive for several days and during that period they were raped regularly by several men. One woman reported that her abduction lasted 6 days and she was raped by 10 men.

?I was returning from the market, that day. I was walking with a group of nine women and two men. We met some armed men along the road. They took the nine women and held us under a tree in their camp. They released us after three days. During all this time, I was raped every night and every day by five men.?
Among the nine women, only three came to the clinic, among which two girls were 12 and 13 years old. 

The women and girls fall victim to rape as they collect firewood outside the refugee camps. Many have been gang-raped in front of their families as the conquering Janjaweed militia burnt down their homes.

Seven women pooled money to rent a donkey and cart, then ventured out of the refugee camp to gather firewood, hoping to sell it for cash to feed their families. Instead, they say, in a wooded area just a few hours walk away, they were gang-raped, beaten and robbed.

Naked and devastated, they fled back to Kalma.
""All the time it lasted, I kept thinking: They're killing my baby, they're killing my baby,"" wailed Aisha, who was seven months pregnant at the time.

The worst case was that of a nine-year-old girl who had left the refugee encampment to gather grass for thatch and as fuel. A smiling man approached her and asked her to help him. She agreed, but as they moved further from the camp she told him her mother had told her not to wander so far.
Turning ugly, the man gagged her and tied her on top of the bundles of grass before raping her repeatedly. On release, she staggered back to the camp where Laird treated her for bleeding so severe that the child was unable to walk for many days afterwards.

In another case, an 11-year-old girl was raped by three armed men when she went to collect grass with her 7-year-old sister. The attack left her so badly injured she had to be evacuated by an African Union helicopter to the nearest hospital for treatment. 

""I am 16 years old. On day, in March 2004, I was collecting firewood for my family when three armed men on camels came and surrounded me. They held me down, tied my hands and raped me one after the other. When I arrive home, I told my family what happened. They threw me out of home and I had to build my own hut away from them. I was engaged to a man and I was so much looking forward to getting married. After I got raped, he did not want to marry me and broke off the engagement because he said that I was now disgraced and spoilt. It is the worse thing for me...
...When I was eight months pregnant from the rape, the police came to my hut and forced me with their guns to go to the police station. They asked me questions, so I told them that I had been raped. They told me that as I was not married, I will deliver this baby illegally. They beat me with a whip on the chest and back and put me in jail. There were other women in jail, who had the same story. During the day, we had to walk to the well four times a day to get the policemen water, clean and cook for them. At night, I was in a small cell with 23 other women. I had no other food than wh"

  Is your point that since israelis are involved with MEMRI, then MEMRI must be biased? Or, is it that jews, for being jews, are not to be believed. If it's the first then, you sir, are an idiot. If it's the second, then it's obvious what you are. (I'll give you a clue: it rhymes with 'racist' you moron!)

  I'm writing this on November the 9th 2008 which means... that the USA has elected a new leader. So what does that do to your Bush is a tyrant statement? If he were a tyrant how is it that americans are free to elect a new Democrat President? How is that possible... if Bush is a tyrant? How is it that a Democrat congress, a liberal majority Supreme Court and many other US gov't entities, sabotage everything Bush has done and all those gov't entities are still around still breathing, still manipulating minorities, if he is a tyrant? How is that? Hmm. You moron!
To bl00dcl0t:
  You ask people to be 'informed' not 'programmed' and then you tell people not to download this torrent. How strange.
 So if this movie is not valid how are we supposed to determine that it isn't valid? Because YOU said so? Moron! To be informed all of us need to see the facts and the lies to then sort them out for ourselves.
 We can't let ourselves get 'programmed' by some asshat named bl00dcl0t!
To Hasnain:
  Instead of telling us that, why don't you tell all those imams, al-Qaradawi, binLaden, HAMAS, Hezbollah, etc. that they are all misunderstanding islam. Go ahead my altruistic friend, tell them. Go to the Middle-East, and the UK, Russia, Africa, China. Tell all those obviously mistaken muslims that they read the quran, hadith and sura the wrong way. Let us know how it went OK. Actually, you wouldn't have to tell us right? Because once you have told them peace is going to breakout all over! Yay!!! You moron!
  To raf999:
  Why bring the mosad into a discussion on islam? That is strange. Very strange. I wouldn't bring up an alcoholic if you told me you were a crossdresser. I don't think anyone that wasn't trying to cause a distraction would do so either. Why are you saying anything to counter what's in the movie? The movie says 'this is proof' you say 'no it's not because of this'. See how that works? Now, instead of point to something other than islam, prove them wrong.
To shaheens:
  Same as Hasnain and raf99 you moron!
To andeanlogic:
  I don't know if you noticed but this whole deal (the torrent, the comments) was about how islam is a danger to the west (USA, UK, all the countries of South America, etc.). Do you have anything to prove any part of the movie is wrong? If not, then why the hell are you talking about all religions and bringing race into this? I can tell you're a kid.
Instead of posting comments about politics here and there on the 'net, wait a few years until you're actually old enough to make a more relevant and compelling argument. Whether you're right or wrong, as long as it has to do with what is being talked about. Good luck.

""MUSLIMS BROUGHT THE FIRST FUCKING UNIVERSITY THERE. EVER THINK WHERE THE WORD ALUMNI COME FORM.""
Whether the Muslims established ""universities"" in Spain or not, there is not question that the European University system of the Middle ages developed entirely independently. 
And since you ask, the word, 'alumni' is the plural of 'alumnus' which is Latin for ""nourished"", ""taught"", ""educated"" being the perfect passive participle of the infinitive 'alumnare' which means to ""nourish"", ""bring up"", or ""educate"".
And what does it have to do with anything?"
