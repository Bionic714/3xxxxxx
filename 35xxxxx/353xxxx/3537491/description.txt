Beaver Hunter 2006 is a beaver hunting game set in the modern day. Hunt down beavers for the sake of enjoyment in a revolutionary game engine (cough, cough). Unlock weapons as you progress, such as machine guns, rifles, and maybe even a bazooka if you are dedicated enough. For every beaver you kill you will learn more and more about the fine art of beaver hunting and you will improve your skills.
