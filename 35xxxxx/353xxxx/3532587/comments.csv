he stated he doesn't want anyone pirating the game
(note to uploader, www.PIRATEbay.org.. what do you think this site's for?)
so he will NOT be uploading the remaining discs..

too bad, find another torrent.. there are plenty of them after all"
,lexxy182002,2008-04-29T04:40Z,"Thank you thank you thank you.  I first baught The Sims CC about 2.5 years ago... and we play it almost constantly...  for the past 3 months, the disk is acting funny... when we reboot the puter is telling us, ""auto play will only work with installation cd""... and we have to eject the disk and put it back in... or other such  nonsense.  I've been trying to figure out how to burn a copy of it so I could put my disks away and not need to use them to play the game, but have not been so successful at it.  You are a lifesaver.  
I also highly reocmmend buying the game... I paid less than 20 dollars for mine used on ebay almost 3 years ago."
,TheMastermind2008,2008-05-27T22:21Z,"Oh thank you thank you, please seed everyone. I lost my disk one and here you are providing it. Still have the box with serial and other disks so this is exactly what I need. Currently downloading, but thanks ahead."
