This is the Sims (not "Sims 2") Complete Collection CD #1. This game is comprised of 4 CDs, only the first of which is copy-protected by SafeDisc v4.

I am not including the serial number with this CD since I am not providing this image to enable you to pirate this game. If you enjoy the game, go buy it. It only cost me $40 USD and has given me hours of enjoyment.

You can use this image to keep your original CDs safe from harm in their case, and to keep your CD free and ready to use without disk swapping.

I recommend that you use Daemon Tools to make use of this image since that program has no nag screens or 30 day time limits, unlike Alcohol 52%/120%.

Go easy on me - This is my first attempt at seeding a torrent that I created. Any tips would be appreciated.
