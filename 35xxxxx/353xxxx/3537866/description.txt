SWBF2 Custom Map Pack

Here is the slimmed down version of the TAW/Gametoast Map Pack that GWL has authorized for use. It only includes SWBF1 Conversion Maps and does not overwrite any SWBF2 game files.

These are the maps that will be used for all GWL SWBF2 Matches where a SWBF1 Conversion Map is chosen as the map to be played.

Current Version 1.7.6 (Note that Gametoast has recently released a 1.7.7 patch but we will not be using this version).
