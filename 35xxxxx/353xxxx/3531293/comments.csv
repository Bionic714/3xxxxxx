[V],hozza,2006-09-29T21:17Z,"Why learn english?? We live in EU and swedish language is like german, polish,norwegian....etc it's another languge to take seriously. It's  like to have all movies in swedish and then shout ""LEARN SWEDISH"". And btw perhaps plonki have some neighbours who are keenly aware :)"
