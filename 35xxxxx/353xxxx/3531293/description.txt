        After Brooke (Aniston) calls it quits with her boyfriend Gary (Vaughn),
        neither person is willing to move out of the condo they share. Taking
        the advice of their repsective friends and confidants (and a few total
        strangers), they both engage in mental warfare designed to force the
        other person to flee the premises -- until they both realize they might
        be fighting to keep their relationship alive.
