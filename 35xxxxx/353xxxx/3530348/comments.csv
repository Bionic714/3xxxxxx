anyone know why?"
,noseman-2,2006-10-08T16:45Z,"How does it not work?

I haven't tried this one yet, but with some other japanese games I've had to rename the image-file because of the unknown characters in their names (you know: ????).

Since this one has kanji in it's name too, I'd suggest renaming it to something like bbr.mdf and trying again."
,GenesisAngel,2006-12-02T20:22Z,"I was hoping someone could help me.  I downloaded it (first I used Daemon Tools) then I installed it.  but when I try to play it gives a message which I believe to be ""Reg: Original Disk please insert"" I don't know what to do.  I burned it to DVD and still no help.  I use applocale to handle the Japanese environment.  Can anyone help me?"
,Enacra,2006-12-03T23:10Z,"This is frustrating. Has anyone else gotten it to work yet? deathwisher, care to tell us how you managed to run it? (assuming you did)"
