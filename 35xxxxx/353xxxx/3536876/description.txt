From included info:

One of the more interesting teaser posters to arrive lately on the net, there\'s nothing
solid to say it, but anyone with half a brain and a fond memory of 1980\'s TV gold will
see right away that this has GOT to be for a movie version of none other than...

STREETHAWK!!!

IMDB isn\'t showing anything yet, but that may not be so suprising since the latest
word from \"a source\" within Universal seems to suggest that this is NOT an outright
teaser poster, but an attempt to test the waters and gauge how much interest there would
be in a movie!

So come on folks - get posting your comments around the web, fill the forums with your
thumbs-up, get a petition going... whatever it takes!! This could be sooo cool - a film
is made because the fans demanded it!!!!
