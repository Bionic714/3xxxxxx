Folque - Vardoger (1976 Norwegian Folk-Rock - 320 kbps)

The Influential Norwegian folk rockers third and probably finest album from 1977 that sounds like classic Fairport or Steeleye Span. A stunning album with male/female vocal harmonies, violin, electric rock guitar and flute etc. creating the archetypal '70's folk rock sound. The lyrics are all in Norwegian but the music is so strong that language is not a barrier to enjoying the album! Highly recommended for anyone who is seriously into '70's folk rock. ? freakemporium.com
