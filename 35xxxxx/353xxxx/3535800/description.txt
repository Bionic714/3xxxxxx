On a sunny morning in September 2001, more than twenty seven hundred people died violently in events of unimaginable horror.

Another killer was unleashed that day. A slow silent poison that now threatens thousands of lives? the toxic dust and gases created by the disintegrating towers. An enormous compression wave pushed through the streets and into buildings with the force of a hurricane.

This is the story of the rescue teams and ordinary people who were caught in the aftermath of this storm. A legacy that should shame the officials.
