,egyptiangod1,2006-11-30T23:41Z,"does anyone know what version this is?  im thinking that i had read that the 15"" mbp's initially shipped with 10.4.5 but now ship with 10.4.6.  and also that the 17"" mbp's shipped with only 10.4.6.  so im thinking that since darkyx said it would not work on his/her 17"" mbp, then it has to be 10.4.5.  or maybe darkyx didnt burn the dvd with disc utility.  is my thinking logical or am i on the wrong track?"
,egyptiangod1,2006-12-01T18:02Z,"good to hear darkyx, that at least gives me some piece of mind"
,egyptiangod1,2006-12-02T03:41Z,"heres my problem...got a mbp15 with a bad hard drive.  need to buy a new one, its sata but i dont know if there are any more requirements that a mac hdd requires (im guessing pretty much any sata notebook drive would work?).  also would i be able to put these 2 discs onto the new hdd (by means of connecting it as a slave to my desktop)?  also what is the difference in the 2 discs?  after one finishes, does it need the other or is it just optional stuff?"

,cafe_gemini,2007-01-22T18:40Z,hi! can anyone seed now....I am stuck at 72.5%...need this badly...
,NuXPeR,2007-01-24T04:22Z,"Been trying to download this torrent (MacbookProRestoreDVD1 OSX10.4), as well as ""MacbookProRestoreDVD2 OSX10.4"" for over a week now and they are both stuck. Can someone please seed these torrents??? I have a 15"" MacBook Pro and my hard drive recently crashed. I have purchased a new hard drive but have misplaced my restore DVD's and all other documents that came with my MacBook Pro. I own a previous PowerBook G4 for years and never had a problem with it - in fact, I'm using it now until I can get my MacBook Pro working again. I didn't expect to have a problem with this one so soon... It's likely not Apple's fault and I blame Fujitsu for a faulty drive. Anyways, I really really need these restore DVD's badly and would be willing to pay someone to mail me copies of these. I have given up on these torrents and it almost brings tears to my eyes to see my poor MacBook Pro sitting here dying to be used... Someone PLEASE PLEASE help me..."
