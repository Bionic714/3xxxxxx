Well if you rip the CD using APE or FLAC encoder, the quality is stunningly good. Nearly as a CD.

Thanks for the torrent though."

With your polite civility, you pre-cluded what was sure to follow:  one of the trademark, just plain breath-takingly stupid remarks that the ingrates and malcontents infesting Pirate Bay have made the stuff of legend.  He has a point though; even where FLAC is concerned, there's signal degredation that has nothing to do with the  protocol (AAC is the closest to 'lossless' I gather - but Apple creeps me out).  Analog signals degrade gracefully over a Signal to Noise curve - digital is an all or nothing proposition.  So if your NIC card, or disk drive or yatta yatta is dropping bits, doesn't matter that is starts out sampled at 192kbs - you'll hear it.)  But after all, it's freeee folks. So put a quarter in the juke and boogie til you puke...Peace out.         "
