Plot Summary for Scum (1979)

_____________________________


This is the hard and shocking story of life in a British Borstal for young offenders. Luckily the regime has changed since this film was made. The brutal regime made no attempt to reform or improve the inmates and actively encouraged a power struggle between the 'tough' new inmate and the 'old hands'. The film was originally made as a BBC play but it was banned before ever being shown. So 'Alan Clarke' and 'Roy Minton' got it re-made as a film. This is a tough and brutal film and should not be viewed lightly.

Allthoug this move was made sometime ago its still actuall and was the first movie in this catory, Bad Boys With Sean Penn is a duplicate of this movie in several ways but not close by a longshoot to the coldness you find in Scum. If you dont like English movies and the way are made you gonna love this one. It containes several clips never shown before, including the long version of the rapescene!
