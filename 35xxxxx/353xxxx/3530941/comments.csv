,zeusgodz,2006-09-28T21:33Z,100% Working. I looked everywhere for this program but couldn't get a full version. Thanks man. Glad someone finally got a working copy and is seeding it. SEED!
,Dudesson,2006-09-28T22:40Z,Looks like this guy gives praise to himself. Any neutral comments?
,Roro,2006-09-29T03:07Z,"Någon som kan ge en liten vink om vad det här används till, affär llr någon sorts försäljning.
Ursäkta den dumma frågan, men jag googlade på namnet men fattar tyvärr inget ändå.  :-\"

,zeusgodz,2006-09-29T10:42Z,"Yep, I did write a positive comment towards myself, but I wanted people to trust this torrent because it took hours of my life to get a working copy (many hours). I'm not trying to glorify myself at all. I'd love for someone to crack the latest version out there, but for now we actually have a working copy of a recent release. Don't hate  me because I'm promoting it. I'm just giving back to the community that I respect so much... hell, it's my first torrent upload and I had to do some research just to share it with the community.  Be glad that I took the time to figure out how to do it. We're all noobs at some point."
,loizides,2006-10-09T14:57Z,thanks sir
,zeusgodz,2006-10-21T11:46Z,"Decided to purchase the software because the newer versions are worth the cost. POSGuys have it for a good price so I went with them. It's not the most perfect program out there, but in my opinion, it's worth it. I guess I'm selling out, but I believe in the software I guess."
,cspat64,2006-11-16T23:19Z,"Thank you for working hard for us to enjoy the good stuff. I'm wondering if you would consider cracking Retail Pro, another good POS too? I have been searching for a crack for it for a long long time."
,cspat64,2006-11-17T14:58Z,"I have downloaded it yesterday. One thing I see is missing is ""Tax name"". I live in Canada so I need to separate GST and PST on the receipt but the cracked version just gave me Tax code # and Tax rate and Tax name is missing."

,bznssolutions,2011-05-15T20:58Z,Hi can anyone confirm they have dowloaded and installed this program.  I can seem to get it to install.  Does it work with vista?  Also the version on here and the keygen is for two different version.  does this make a difference.  
,tinytheyfon,2011-06-21T20:29Z,"Hey ZeusGodz,

Do you think you could make a keygen for Plexis 2.9, the newer one?"
,02915a,2011-07-30T19:44Z,Yeah this was great while it worked on my 32 bit xp but now that it's gone I would also like to see a new version posted please?
,mtotheathe,2011-10-16T18:42Z,"My friends, since this doesn't work on win7 you might want to consider the open-source alternative @
