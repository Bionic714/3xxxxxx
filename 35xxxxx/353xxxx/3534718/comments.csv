Thank you uploader!"

,SeedsofEvil,2008-06-27T22:32Z,"the subs and audio files are in the info, and yes i saw this version when i was a kid and got great enjoyment, came here looking for the new one but found no torrents, can't say i'm disapointed though as i get to watch this one again. This story is brilliant based on the book by jules vernes (correct me if i am wrong) who also wrote 10.000 leagues under the sea, the story that introduced captain nemo and his submarine (before submarines were even invented i may add and his sub was remarkable considering how similar it was to the submarines we have today) basicly point of this comment is to say get this and if you enjoy go get 10,000 leagues under the sea too. Sorry for so much text :)"
,SeedsofEvil,2008-07-02T01:14Z,"just watched it alot better than i recall, hope you enjoy it too"
,master_b415,2008-07-18T01:50Z,"Bravo....Well done! Indeed, a rare, hard to find classic. And everything works. Worth the long dl. Thank you very much, cheers."
