,Marinko420733,2008-02-02T17:18Z,"Thanks for this GREAT U/L WinnieXL and for all those who still seed it :-)
I've just finished D/L this, made an ISO of it, and played (the music od DCD is so goooood :-)).
But there are some important  info what I must submit for others who want d/l this film, in what the uploader's above description of this feature is not correct:
1 - The content is region free (good news :-)
2 - Audio is NOT DD 5.1, it is just DD 2.0 stereo, with 192 kbs (bad news)

I was so happy at first to see that it has 5.1 audio, I was hopeing that 4AD had the original masters of the concert, the film and the CD of DCD was made of, and remastered it to 5.1 for the DVD release. Unfortunately not. 
Anyway, the music of DCD still the best :-), even in simple stereo :-)))"

,intobearzz,2008-06-23T05:15Z,"hi uploader. major fan of DCD. Saw then twice live. I have downloaded this twice and it is only showing me one video 8 mins clip and it's a 5.35 gib. i try converting it and it only burnt the 8 mins video and not the Santa Monica Theater concert. is there something wrong with? is anybody having the same problem i am having?
