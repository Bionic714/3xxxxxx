The independent story about four young men on a journey throughout Europes lonesome roads. They visit places like Oldenburg, Amsterdam, Paris, Cannes, Nice, Pisa and what not now... On of them poops green squishy poo and a second gets shampoo in his eyes.

What no one expects is that a magical spell turns one of them into a wooden doll called Maggan-Doggan.
