,nlitement,2006-09-30T10:26Z,"Hey, nice job there, freemod. You silly.. err, fucking stupid thing.. if you would've learnt to FUCKING SPELL A LANGUAGE PROPERLY, then maybe I'd notify you of your mistake in a calm manner. You shithead still think that everyone has:

Windows
ET.exe named ""ET""
The same ""tcetest"" directory as you
The VERY SAME RAM as you, or some other guy..?

""OR THE SAME WITH LINUX EXECUTABLE SHOULD GET U [horrible, horrible, horrible sic.] STARTED"" - nice addition there for a Windows example.

This new ""update"" is a huge disappointment.. can't stand people licking its ass because it's ""new"". I can't even really analyze it too much because I CAN'T GET TO PLAY BECAUSE OF ADMINS BEING FUKCHEADS ADDING SHITTY MAPS I DON'T GIVE A DAMN ABOUT. WHERE THE FUCK _IS_ OUR CLIENT-SIDE PURE CVAR, MISTER DICKHEAD THE DEVELOPER?!"
