,d3synguy,2008-01-23T02:27Z,"Ummm... I'm American, but I have to ask. Is this site not based in a country other than America? Is it not used by people in other countries? These people are obviously uploading torrents. So what makes you think you can come in here and demand they speak English?

Dumb fuck."

Waldobaby, the pirate bay is based in Sweden. 

Their primary language is Swedish, however Finnish  and many other languages are widely used. Not to mention it is used world wide.

Waldobaby shows himself to be ignorant and arrogant, especially compounded by his harsh offensive language, however not all of us from the United States are like Waldobaby. 

He should be ashamed of himself because it just takes one prick like him making an ass of himself like this to further degrade our public image. 

But pay him no mind; he must be a fool if he cannot figure out what, ""buona versione di Alcoholl20"" means. Especially since theirs only four words and one is a cognate, one is an English proper noun, buona should be pretty obvious and di is clearly an article. Even if you never studied a foreign language that should not be very hard to figure out unless you have been living under a rock your whole life.
