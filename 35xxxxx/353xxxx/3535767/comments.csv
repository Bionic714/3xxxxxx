,Robert Fraser,2006-12-24T01:01Z,"OK... Same as the rest of you over here - 75.8%. Yet, I've seen users on deck with 100% of the file that might be seeding the torrent but aren't permitting others to use it. Be nice - it's almost Christmas, k?"

,The_Mollusk,2008-03-10T02:42Z,"wow, that has to go down as one of the worst descriptions I've ever read. call me when you have a decent description consisting of artist information, sound quality, album and song listing, and list of any other files in the torrent (track lists, album art, videos, etc.)"
