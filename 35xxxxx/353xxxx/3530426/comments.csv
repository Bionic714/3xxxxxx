.ogg or .shn format can be a nice addition to ur putter. IMO .shn is the best way to losseless pack 5.1 channel but .ogg is most popular for regular stereo.

I know there's the Flac format which actually is lossless, but I thought it more simple just to keep it as wave. You could always go for an mp3 version of the album if you are concerned about file sizes, I'm sure there are several torrents with mp3's."
