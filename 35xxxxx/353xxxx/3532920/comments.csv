,Anton_norton,2006-10-07T11:58Z,Does windows update work on the jacked versions? 
,teathief,2006-10-24T20:16Z,"I'm having trouble installing the nvidia driver for
3D acceleration I don't have jacked installed
on my main partition though and was wondering
if jacked supports the nvidia unified driver
or if not having it on my main C:\ partion
is messing with the drivers ability to install itself

or if it was the fact that jacked doesn't seem
to come with any default vga drivers
as the unified installers for nvidia and ati
usually require the adaptor to at least already
be setup with 'default vga'"
