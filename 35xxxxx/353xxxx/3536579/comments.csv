,krossadelgitarr,2006-10-14T16:47Z,vad är deta för nåt???
,Letorion,2006-10-16T02:47Z,"Krossadelgitarr: Det är en TV-serie med Blade the vampirehunter. Inte riktigt uppföljare till filmerna med Wesley Snipes, snarare mer en spinoff från dom. 

Läs på http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0823333/ för mer info."
