SYNOPSIS:     Top Hollywood talent agent Jack Giamoro (Ben Affleck) seems to have it all: a successful career, money, a beautiful wife. But he still feels like something is missing, and so he takes a journal writing class to explore his feelings. But when Jack learns his wife Nina (Rebecca Romijn) is cheating on him with his most important client his perfect life quickly starts to unravel. Things get even worse when Jack?s journal --which contains secrets that could ruin him personally and professionally -- is stolen by ambitious journalist Barbi (Bai Ling). Jack must fight back to hold on to everything he has fought so hard to win, and in doing so he finally achieves the self-insight he was looking for -- and he realizes that only through family can he really find lasting happiness.
