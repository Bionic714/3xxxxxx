Why would you think it was unaired?? Quality of the original is just fine, thanks. Your version isn't a patch on the ""real"" pilot show which is on here somewhere..."
,Joel_Matton,2006-10-31T20:12Z,"Um, no. This was NOT aired as the pilot of the show. This is not the pilot, this is the unaired pilot. Two different things. It has different actors playing Dean and Sookie. Did you ignore both the description AND not watch it?"
,LasaireLukesh,2006-12-13T02:54Z,"ACHTUNG SPOILER: ...these are two different shows alright, realy cool :) im also glad they changed the actor for sookie. that other woman was wierd. but they must have made it up for the actress by writing in a part for her as a even wierder harp player. 

i do think they could have kept the original actor for dean. 

thanx for uploading this, i will surely be seeding.
