,BBu,2006-09-30T12:13Z,"The game has one major bug with Soundblaster Audigy 2 and there is no patch. 

You need to lower the hardware acceleration. Otherwise the game will crash your computer -> Bluescreen, reboot.

How to lower the hardware acceleration?
Control Panel -> Sounds and Audio Devices
At the bottom you find ""Speaker settings"", click there on ""Advanced..."". Than on ""Performance"" and lower it (upper controller)
(Basic acceleration works for me)."
