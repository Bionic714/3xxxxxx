,daytriper,2006-12-31T22:24Z,awesome man. been looking for these for a while. Great up
,daytriper,2007-01-01T00:20Z,any seeds? sitting at 66.5. DL 73 times
,eden5900,2007-01-02T04:34Z,"hang in there buddy - it took me almost 2 weeks to get - whoever the original seeder is just logs in once in a while. SEED AFTER YOU GET IT - i'm the only seed and can't go forever here boys...

totally worth it though - there was nothing like a live smalls show!"
,daytriper,2007-01-03T03:01Z,No doubt. Smalls live was crazy
,eden5900,2007-01-03T05:18Z,"heh, it'd probaly be faster if i burnt them on a dvd and dropped it in the mail.."
,jaybag,2008-07-17T01:31Z,someone please seed!!!!!!!
,godofgrind,2008-07-19T22:47Z,hope this trackers stillup. long live the smalls
,godofgrind,2008-07-19T22:52Z,"i only saw on e smalls show i didn't like as much as the rest. they played the golden garter in edmonton for their 10 year anniversary, with strapping young lad and slow fresh oil opening. SYL complately slayed that show. every other show, from back at the bronx to red's, they were one of the best live acts...ever!!!
hope some seeds pop up
cheers"

,godofgrind,2008-07-21T04:30Z,i've got it all. i'll seed it for a few weeks at least
,fuzzbrain2,2008-11-26T04:23Z,"When I go to listen to all these albums the songs are all wonky, like every 10-15 seconds the song changes even though the player stills says its the same song."
,Malefoy666,2009-10-31T04:45Z,"Merci beaucoup!!!

SĂŠrieusement, c'est assez difficile Ă  trouver comme band!!!

Merci encore!!! "
,Mr.Beemu,2009-12-11T10:18Z,I true gem.  Will continue to seed. 
,Count666,2010-02-15T06:30Z,Ill seed for as long as I can
,DragonChaserKev,2011-02-01T10:32Z,"A few songs are done and play fine.

One of my all time favourite bands!!! Saw them several times back in the day, can't remember them all, one was on New Year's I think at Public Domain?  The other was in Leduc I think.  Also now that I think about it I believe I saw them as well in a place called The Rock Slide.  Can't remember the details but I remember the music and the pits.  Fun.
Pretty sure all these albums are available still from Stony Plain Records at $20 a piece.  I think that also includes shipping.  Just to let you know.

the smalls, they should have been bigger

Corb Lund is fine doing his country thing, puts on a good show I've seen twice but it is nothing compared to the smalls."
,ircanuck,2011-06-04T21:08Z,"Wow, I can't believe this is still going."
