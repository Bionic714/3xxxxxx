The reasons explained on that website are, imo, mostly bullshit. Having a load of rar files will no more or less ensure that this is an original release then if one shares one large AVI.
Splitting a release into many files of equal size may make a lot of sense when distributing them via newsgroups, but for bittorrent I do not see any advantage. On the contrary: for watching the AVI one has to extract the file, requireing twice the space on the HDD, which will lead many people to deleting the RARs and only keeping the AVI, resulting in fewer seeds. 

Furthermore, the sfv file is not necessary for bittorent since it uses its one checksum.

And if one wants to have a sample with the ""full featured AVI"" (which is another argument brought forward on that site), then this can be added to the main AVI file just as it is added to the rar files. Thus, the sample is no reason to use RAR either.

So again, on bittorent, using RARs just makes no sense!"
,therealduckie,2007-02-12T08:49Z,"I have to agree..

rars are for shit and whiny dial up users who arent smart enough to get broadband shouldnt be downloading torrents.  If you dont have broadband, it's not our fault.  Why should we have to suffer.

And in the many years I have downloaded torrents, not once have I had such an issue that a torrent was corrupted. That's pure poppycock and I'd like you to prove this happens if you plan on using it as your defense.  I see no proof, therefore I call bullshit on your premise.

I mean, what if someone has 2 gigs left on their drive and the torrent is 1.5 gigs of rars?  How the fuck are they supposed to unrar it?  It becomes useless unless that person deletes something off their drive, which they might want or need, just to make room. Maybe the rar is an iso of an OS they need to burn because their OS is corrupt but they only have enough space and time to get the right iso.  Makes no sense to rar it.

Rar fanboys are just pushers trying to overwhelm a once great torrent community. 

Oh, and also---with an Avi, Mpeg, MP4, MP3, or other FILE, not rar, people can preview it to see if it is the real file and not a fake.  Rar's ruin that possibility and a lot of crap torrents go unnoticed because of it.  "
