Anyone helping me get the 100% I need to continue spreading this documentary is a god!"
,kashman,2007-11-26T04:03Z,"So far I've seeded this to a ratio of ~9 and will keep seeding unless I need to seed something else. Once that something else is done seeding I'll put this on again. So it shouldn't stay unsseded for very long periods. 
If you cant find a seed post here and I'll put it on asap."
,SiliconJaguar,2007-11-28T05:34Z,"please. I too would like to download this DVD. I ran a BBS for many many years in my early life.  First on a CMB 64 with IEE-488 8250LP Dual 1Meg 5.25"" drives. Then on an Amiga 1000 with a home brew ST506 RLL 32Meg Hard drive. Them were the days!. I'd love to watch this old doco on the good old days. I am happy to seed for a while afterwards also. My BBS was `The Transcendental CONNECTION'. :)"
,tajisen,2008-03-19T16:29Z,"I have always seeded this one, if you see no seeders, then blame the tracker. Right now I have seeded 3623 GB on this torrent, which gives a ratio of 1578."

,Jason Scott,2008-11-28T10:42Z,"Hey, kids.

It's Jason Scott, director of the BBS Documentary. I just wanted to stop in and leave a note about how this particular torrent has been seeded and downloaded for over TWO YEARS! An amazing thing, considering how quick stuff comes and goes with the torrents. I hope you've all been enjoying the movie, and I'm working on a new one, at http://www.getlamp.com (GET LAMP, which is about text adventures).

Keep enjoying the movie."
