,Gestalt,2006-10-16T07:35Z,"Great torrent, but perhaps you should superseed it if you have a slow connection? 50 mb in two days means that it will take appr. three months to finish it at this rate. :)"
,seej,2006-10-16T23:48Z,"I've been superseeding it (""initial-seeding"" set on utorrent) all along. The problem is a slow connection in my area - up speed averages at 25kb/s.

But even though I've uploaded over 760MB till now, utorrent shows an availability of 1.04. :["
,p4to,2006-10-23T19:45Z,"everybody is at 84,5 % do you still seed?"
,Thurston1,2006-10-23T22:21Z,Stuck at 43% seed pleese!
,JaymiUSA,2006-10-24T14:26Z,Stuck at 84.5.  Help  me finish and I'LL Superseed.  Must spread the word.
,seej,2006-10-26T21:14Z,"Seems to be a bug with utorrent or some exotic virus: I started off seeding 100%, but a few days later a couple of the mp3 files disappeared from my hard disk and I was left with 95%. A week later, more files had disappeared and it was down to 85%. Anyway, got my hands on a backup which I'll chuck into the bermuda triangle to start seeding 100% again."
,seej,2006-10-27T09:13Z,"Ok, I'm seeding again :]"
,Gestalt,2006-10-27T11:08Z,Nice. :) Strange about the disappearing files though. Sounds a bit ominous.
,FooReal,2006-11-08T20:34Z,"Brilliant!, as Paula would have put it."
,seej,2006-11-17T21:04Z,"funkbeast, the release you're talking about is a recorded set of aphex twin playing at the primavera sound festival in spain. you can download the set here: http://www.thescenesaver.com/music/techno/aphextwin-2002-05-18liveatPrimaverasoundSpain.mp3"
,seej,2007-01-02T20:17Z,"maxpowerz, are you looking for this: http://www.discogs.com/release/83651

If so, I found it on ed2k. The hash is: 5FA6896AEB4CD5F62052B8A322CD7B95"
,seej,2007-01-10T13:14Z,"Chill Out or Die! is now being seeded. Get the torrent here: http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3593507/Various_-_Chill_Out_Or_Die__(RSN_LP_8)_(1993)

(This is mixed by Casper Pound, not Aphex Twin. Though the style - ambient - is similar.)"
,eMalware,2007-05-08T22:43Z,"Hopefully there's still decent seeds going, haha.

2.39GB is bit of a hard pill to swallow for me right now, so I'm just grabbing certain things. Thanks anyway."
,jegharto,2007-09-16T13:49Z,"super torrent, but one of the songs from 26mfc is missing, and there are are a few skips in the analords and the universal indicator collection isnt complete (and is it by the way aphex twin?)
better download the flac version of analords and the other ui-torrent instead but the rest is just great!"
,ANicki_InTheUk,2007-10-18T01:09Z,"OOHH I HAVE WAITED SOOO LOOONG FOR THIS GOD BLESS YOU MY CHILD I AM ONE HAPPY FUCKER OF A BUNNY WABBIT NOW. YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Me So Happy..."
,Sachaztan,2007-10-29T21:40Z,Oh man...I want this so bad!
,ANicki_InTheUk,2007-12-02T23:28Z,"ooh maaan, i'm still so happy about this shit that i'm a seed this forever.. but i don't have my own connection so only active 3-4 times a week, patience people....    aaaaaaaaaaaaah."
,Onito,2007-12-13T07:25Z,"Hmm, just finished downloading it, and like more then 50% of the files are "".bc!"" format. What is this? :P Never seen it before, and neither has my mp3... Whats going on? And is there some sort of converting program for this? Thanks."
,seej,2007-12-29T13:55Z,"Assuming you're using BitComet, those .bc! files are incomplete download files generated by that program. This means your torrent hasn't actually finished downloading. Raise this issue with BitComet or use another client instead, like uTorrent."
,Zettez,2008-04-09T21:08Z,"woot lol nice! you saved me from my boredoom, "
,mrstudly2687,2008-04-29T19:40Z,"seriously seed guys...you just got 50+ albums of aphex twin for nothing (except time) and you should at least have the decency to seed.

thanks seej"
,mrstudly2687,2008-05-03T08:26Z,seed y'all c'mon
,cobalt69,2008-12-21T20:05Z,WTF?!!?!!  it keeps saying element not found at about 50% ???? 
,catgravy,2009-02-06T19:06Z,I am at .636 for seeding. I will seed all the aphex twin / afx and richard d james that i find if i find some that i do not have. also when i do find some that i do not have i will upload the torrent here first. but i have alot of his stuff. i could listen to it all day and usually do. 
,Boolyman,2009-03-27T16:53Z,cobalt69; I think RDJ just rolled over your broadband connection in his tank..
,kane97,2009-07-15T17:35Z,Seed please
,856yt76,2009-11-30T05:16Z,seed please! ill seed this forever
,iceet,2010-01-01T04:49Z,This is amazing. I can't thank you enough for this. You're the man now dawg!
,miniweiz,2010-01-21T01:37Z,"This fucking blows! Most of the songs are shitty 120 kbs, there are maybe 10 songs that are 320 kbs. This crappy quality is disgraceful to Aphex twin, gtfo til you get better quality >:("
,KentuckyFakeChicken,2010-02-09T18:27Z,Is what miniweiz says true? Pretty shite compared to my Analord FLAC's...
,KentuckyFakeChicken,2010-03-15T21:53Z,A high quality discography is due for next month or something.
,Halfbrother,2010-06-26T07:40Z,im getting 3mb/s here the torrent is great for my location! better than my internets average speed.
,EyeOfTheMuffin,2010-11-05T03:46Z,People that complain about the quality of the sound just shut up because first of all its free and seej took the time to upload it. Second of all if your going to continue complaining go and buy the damn albums. Thank you seej for this upload!
,ramiere,2010-12-28T00:01Z,"Too awesome, took a while but I got it!"
,cc101,2011-02-27T19:06Z,would be nice to have more hq stuff... afx really deserves to be listened to in 320kbps
,everlife_420,2011-04-13T23:02Z,"Mad props on the upload. And to all the people dissin on the low quality, GO BUY IT YOURSELF!! lol. Thanks again for the upload. Will be seeding for a while."
,serious_joker,2012-02-28T14:28Z,"WARNING: This discography is messy, inaccurate, and things are missing.

NEVERTHELESS, this is worth downloading, just be ready for HOURS of fix up work.  Ugh..."
