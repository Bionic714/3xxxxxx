,Heritage97,2007-04-30T22:12Z,How do I open ISO files in DVD Shrink?
,Heritage97,2007-05-01T16:08Z,OK I realized I needed 3.2 then it worked!
,musicvault,2009-10-19T20:50Z,Hope they seed long enough. Thanks anyway for uploading...the last one I tried had a shitty quality. 4.3 GB wasted just like that. You're a trusted member so hoping for the best.
,mirkwood_archer,2009-10-21T16:00Z,"slow but great torrent, thanks so much. the quality of the .iso files are amazing. but when you burn it, the quality significantly decreases. is there any better way to burn these files? i wonder how it's done in the original dvd's. cause the .iso files are bigger than the capacity of a dvd. anybody who can help about that?"

Check your local cd/dvd supplier and am sure most have them.
Also, your burner must be dual layer capable-
most now are but oler skool types o' burners may not [just in case that wasn't obvious]."
