Orig pouÃ«t.net BBS post by ghandy:
Just in case you are interested into that sort of stuff and understand the german language:

Yesterday the german sender WDR5 brought a very interesting transmission about mp3 thievery, the sense of tracking and procecuting filesharers etc.
The editorial staff of Gulli.com was also present by giving the journalist a few statements about that matter. The original title was "Musikdiebstahl im Netz - Unterwegs mit einem mp3-Detektiv"
