,Pooslice,2006-10-08T06:40Z,There's something called RSS feeds
,blademccool,2006-10-09T16:54Z,Woe is me to be as bandwidth starved as I am so as not to consider the possibility of just downloading any random thing that crops up on a feed ;)

,blademccool,2006-10-11T02:05Z,Maybe I'm angry because I'm constipated? Yeah and I guess yer right its not so much yelling as talking in a silly voice.
