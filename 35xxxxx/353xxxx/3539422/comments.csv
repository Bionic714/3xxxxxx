,jsjoholm,2008-11-10T20:01Z,"I think its worth noting that it is indeed NOT the complete series. It misses:

the initial 4 episodes (the ""plunder and lightning"" episodes which were released as a intro movie to the show on DVD) 

the 32th episode (or episode 128 per the uploaders counting) entitled ""Last Horizons"" is missing.

and it also misses the last episode entitled ""Flying Dupes"" "
