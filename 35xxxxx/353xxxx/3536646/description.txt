I have included the 1.5FW and it is ready to use.
Hold the power button down on your PSP so that it switches it off properly.
Hold the R button and turn on the power so that it runs the RECOVERY menu.
Make sure you have the AC connected to your PSP.
Select the option to run the update flasher.
Let it run, then you will be back at 1.50FW.
