,FatFreddy247,2007-02-20T23:27Z,"BEWARE of the 11.11 update, it installs PROTEXIS software as an XP service which PSP becomes dependent on to run.  After a period PSP will not launch.  Google it and you'll see what it mean."

,AxxlAxxlAxxl,2007-04-26T16:21Z,How do u download the program???
,FatFreddy247,2007-05-09T11:30Z,"I've found one workaround on the net users can try to beat the Protexis Licensing but I'm staying on 10.03 until the issue is resolved. 


Install PSP 11.00 and normally license the program offline. 


Go to program dir and find PSIKey.dll and backup it somewhere. 


Now install Patch 11.11 


After patch with PSP 11.11 in program directory remove PsiClient.dll 

and replace with backuped PSIKey.dll and rename it into PsiClient.dll 


Then go to Administrative Tools -> Services and stop ProtexisLicensing 

(or just press Start-> Run -> services.msc and press Enter) 

Stop the service and put on Disable. 


Go to Strat-> Run -> sc delete ProtexisLicensing 

and press Enter, now ProtexisLicensing will be removed from services list 


Go to SYSTEM32 folder and delete this files: 

- PSIService.exe 

- PSIKey.dll

,.grave_digger.,2009-04-06T05:13Z,"the damn keygen doesn't work, everything comes up ""Invalid Serial Number"". anyone got a fix for this?"
,.grave_digger.,2009-04-06T05:34Z,program doesn't work. every single time it permanently freezes up about 15 seconds after you start the program. total waste of time.
