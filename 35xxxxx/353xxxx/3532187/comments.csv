,swamiolsson,2009-12-02T21:11Z,"Just now three people helped me out, downloading this. The heaviest of them gave me a stream of 666+ kb/s, and he came on and went off. But things really moved. The other two gave a smaller streaming, but steady. And the moment I reached 100%, all three went offline.
If this was done deliberately by seeders, who keep an eye on the peers, I'm impressed. You guys, - if this was deliberate - showed the kind of consideration that I would like to see all over the P2P networks.
Thanks for the download (which I had almost given up on), junoon and the three seeders who helped me out."
