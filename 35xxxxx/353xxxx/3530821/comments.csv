There is no doubt that there was something more that planes that took down the towers.
And what about WTC 7? Nothing hit it, but it still went down like a card house.
Think about it folks....THINK!

if there is anywhere in the world I'd rather be living at this time, it would definitely be in your spot of the world.

Love is the only way foreward.

why? is it so hard to get that besides damage from the crashed plane, intense heat from FIRE caused the steel to get soft so that eventually the SKYSKRAPER collapsed under its own weight...

''And what about WTC 7? Nothing hit it, but it still went down like a card house.''

ok? so you mean that ''bush'' planted a bomb in WTC7??? very smart to detonate... maybe nobody will notice that it went down when as you say ''nothing hit it'' LOL"
