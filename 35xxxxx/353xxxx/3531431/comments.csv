,candy87,2006-10-07T11:36Z,"Call me a dumbass or whatever, but how can i make the subs work? I use VLC, but have no idea how to get the subs working. Please help!"
,pseudonymo,2006-10-07T15:05Z,"HOW TO GET SUBS IN VLC

If the subs are located as a seperate file, you must go into the settings (ctrl+s) and choose video. In the video-dropdown menu (which you get by pressing the little arrow to the left of where it says 'video'), you will be able to choose 'Subtitles/OSD'. Here is an option to choose subtitles. You choose the subtitle-file, and now you must close VLC and start it again. Violรก."
