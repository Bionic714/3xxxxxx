-TAGLINE-
	 Bigger than Goldfinger's Finger - Bigger Than Thunderball's (. . . . . . .)

-WHAT THE BOX SAYS-
	For Your Height Only is a legend amongst lovers of truly "out there" cinema. A film about a two and a half foot tall Filipino secret agent: a kung fu master and suave loving machine who struts his stuff in a Travolta style white suit... 

Can it be true that such a film exists? It can and it does. Unquestionably one of the most whacked out movies in the world, it tells the incredible story of how agent 00 - played by the legendary Weng Weng - takes on the mysterious "Mr Giant" and his death dealing gang of white slavers and drug dealers. See him fly through the sky in his mini jet pack, see him fell his opponents with below the belt kung fu action....just see him!

-WHAT REALLY HAPPENS-
	Dear god.

-Notes-

BadMovies.org review: http://www.badmovies.org/movies/yourheight/

*I should note allthough I say 'midget' multiple time, I don't actually think he is a midget. Midgets and dwarfs have certain proportions that differ from regular people, but Weng Weng looks completely proportianl, just unbelievably small. 

Good god what the fuck did I just watch. Seriously, I have no idea. I've sat through The Crippled Masters multiple times, I've seen my fair share of horrible movies, so why can't I just stick this in the part of my mind that forgets them? Some parts are so goddamned golden you'd think I was in tears, yet its so horribly put together and orchestrated that it leaves me feeling like I just had a retinal enema. From a industrial sandblaster. Filled with powdered glass soaked in salted lemon juice. I can hardly remember a godamned thing about the movie, I dont even have a clue as to the plot, yet WENG WENG haunts my dreams.

I really don't want to talk more about this movie. I am still trying to un-burn its image from my mind. I am truly truly sorry. May god forgive me.
