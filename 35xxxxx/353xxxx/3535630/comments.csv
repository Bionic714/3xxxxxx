,AfterDark,2006-10-14T19:38Z,"Extremely smooth, Neotic! Great upload and seeding."
,CaribouLou,2006-10-15T23:12Z,"Is this quality better than the 1-6 seasons floating around?  I'm a little disappointed that the 20 gb of oz I have are not nearly up to par with the xvid versions of Deadwood and Rome.   They are perfectly watchable but inferior to all other dvd rips I've seen.  Looking for the 'holy grail' of Oz torrents!

Please comment about the specific quality I would really appreciate it."
[V],neotic,2006-10-16T19:09Z,"Yes, this is good quality. ;)"
,hovinen,2006-10-18T13:31Z,How fast are you guys getting this? I´m downloading this only like 70-100kb/s....what can I do to get it faster? I have a 1gb cable connection so that can´t the problem.
[V],neotic,2006-10-18T23:12Z,cable doesn't support 1gigabit ;)
,CaribouLou,2006-10-20T02:33Z,"sorry for another dumb question but how do I get the sound to work?  I'm gonna look into an AC3 codec on google, but I assume the sound is there for you guys?

And if you're getting 70-100 kbps, you shouldn't complain.  My connection is claimed at 6.0 Mbps but it's still gonna take a few weeks to get all this oz!"
,CaribouLou,2006-10-20T02:44Z,"okay nm it took all of 4 seconds to find the AC3 filter, shouldn't have even mentioned it.

It's not quite the 'holy grail' I was looking for, but noticably better (from what I've seen) than the other oz out there.  If I were to nit pick, I'd ask for a widescreen version.

Anyways THANK YOU FOR THIS TORRENT!  I will seed at least 1.5 ratio, like I always do.  I'll be seeding this for months."
,tofulicious,2006-10-22T14:06Z,THANKS!  :-D
,hovinen,2006-10-23T10:06Z,Season.3 Episode.1 Is not working...why?
,RIPRAW,2006-10-23T20:40Z,"Thanks very much for these.

However, I believe season 4 is nuked. I don't know how it was ripped, but it seems that as you go through the series, the episodes get more and more out of sync. By episode 16, it is unwatchable. 

Can anyone else confirm? Is it just the later episodes in series 4? I haven't got around to watching Season 5 yet (another MEDiEVAL Release)
"
[V],neotic,2006-10-31T10:58Z,"Every episode is working great for me, episode 16 on season 4 is as good as any other.

,LuNk4n,2006-11-10T15:37Z,"***** ATTENTION ALL SEEDERS AND LEECHERS *****

- Do not cap (limit) your upload speed. A high upload speed will not affect your download speed. In fact: The faster you upload to people the faster your download speed will be! If the total speed in the swarm is fast, it will go faster for all of us, including you.

- Please keep seeding after you downloaded all parts. This torrent is so big that you need to show solidarity with those that have not yet reached 100%. I?m begging you to stay and seed. This is a great show and should be given to as many people as possible. 

- Try to make yourself available to as many clients as possible.


Enjoy, and welcome back to OZ?

,Hei_på-deg,2008-03-22T11:21Z,"Yes, when you finish downloading and just keep it running, you're seeding.
It's very helpful for the torrent if people seed as long as they can.
Ideally you should upload as much as you download.

Set your upload speed to about 80% of max."

,dirty_cousin,2008-04-05T12:01Z,This torrent took me about three days to download.  I'd say thats pretty decent for size of file.  Everything is there in good quality so I don't see why anyone seeking all the oz would go for another torrent.

,butanebobb,2008-06-30T13:08Z,LuNk4n - If you upload at full throttle it actually chokes your download speed. You can throttle your upload speed to about 75-80% of its maximum before it starts affecting your download rate.

You will need to change the frame per second setting in the .sub or .srt files from 25.000 to 23.976 in order to get  a good match. Use mediainfo to know with wich frame/second the video files are set and then change the setting in the .sub or .srt files."

vous devrez changer dans les fichiers .srt ou .sub le nombre d'images/seconde de 25.000 à 23.976 pour que ça soit syncro. utilisez mediainfo pour voir à combien d'images par seconde la vidéo est ""settée"" et ensuite vous n'avez qu'à allez changer la valeur dans le fichier .srt ou .sub correspondant."
