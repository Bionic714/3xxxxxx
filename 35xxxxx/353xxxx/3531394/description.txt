Description: International action star and heartthrob Jean Paul Belmondo brings his smoldering intensity to French super-spy Joss Baumont, a top agent sent on a mission to assassinate a foreign dictator. But when the political winds change, and Baumont is double-crossed by his own government, revenge becomes the name of the game. Director Georges Lautner delivers a taut, thrilling espionage drama with a sensational score from Ennio Morricone.
