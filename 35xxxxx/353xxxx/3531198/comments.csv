,n4meless,2006-12-05T11:50Z,Can someone please seed the torrent is going to die 
,Devious!,2007-01-01T06:23Z,"For all those people saying ""Its a virus, it has viruses!!""

Its a hacking toolkit... Of course Norton and other anti viruses will say its a virus, and say ""Hack tool"" they're picking these up as dangerous because they can cause harm. If you don't understand that you shouldn't even be downloading this torrent!"
[V],d0nk3y,2007-01-29T13:42Z,Nice package.
,xaviel,2007-02-21T05:32Z,"lol ""it has virus"", don't believe everything norton tells you...the cracks i DL to patch games i own have ""viruses"" too...:D"
,CoLLecToR 91,2007-04-03T21:40Z,"LOL! 
What do u noobs expect to find in a package like this when u virus scan it?
You are downloading crack tools! They will ALWAYS be detectedas viruses, even if they are NOT viruses.
The ""bloodhound"" and the ""trojan"" is what u download. Exept it wont harm u, but ur victims.

,StiCkS515000,2007-05-04T09:26Z,"some of you are to much~~IT'S A HACKING PROGRAM you get it... of course norton is going to pick it up..It's got some really good stuff. Run your anti-virus through each folder seperatly. If you see a virus and you don't know what the fuck your doing...DON'T OPEN IT!!!
The Bloodhound and trogen are their for a reason. It's part of the program your downloading~~Maybe you should just go download some music off Limewire"
,jordfras,2007-05-26T21:53Z,"Trojans don't belong in packers or batch file compilers, no matter what you 1337 h4XX0r5 say!
