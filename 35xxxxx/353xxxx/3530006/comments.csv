hoping this is fixed one.. some1 confirm plz"
,Tantalos,2006-09-30T10:31Z,"shahab101, I don't know about the other d/l, but this one here is fine! I've flown the 747 yesterday without any probs!"
,Empress102,2006-09-30T11:27Z,"Beautiful installation! And for the most part it works great.

However, I had the ""blackout"" problem someone else mentioned, and a couple other quirks.

My PFD went offline just seconds after departure.

The map screen never worked.

The autopilot and Y/D refused to work after repeated attempts to engage both.

ECAS messages: 

""No Y/D""
""No autoland""

Electrics checked, double checked and triple checked, no faults found.

Anyone else experience this?  Any suggestions on how to fix it?"
,Tantalos,2006-09-30T12:32Z,"It seems that there is indeed some sort of copy protection build in that causes failures!

I did not encounter it, yet. Let's see if someone can figure out what's going on here."
,David-7237,2006-09-30T12:42Z,"well, for me, I use my way.. I install them and then copy my license key in aircraft.cfg and in windows folder then I fly....

that will ensure everything works like 100%

althu, installing is easier.."
,carter2241,2006-09-30T15:04Z,"Where abouts did u get that Liscence key from and how do you copy it to the aircraft.cfg

thx"
,tendu,2006-09-30T15:28Z,Same problems here with PFD and map screen.
,legendary_goku,2006-09-30T18:57Z,"Just download maximus his package it's really great and no problems at all...

He is a master in cracking..."
,David-7237,2006-09-30T19:16Z,"here what I do...

1st: I installed it using the crack with it(the same way we used to do it)

now sometimes the crack doesn't write the correct key or doesn't write it in the correct place..
(SOMETIMES YOU NEED TO RE-INSTALL USING THE CRACK TILL YOU GET THE CORRECT KEY)

2nd: I go to aircraft.cfg and scroll down till I find this line     //Do Not Alter the following line or your 747-400 may cease operating.
[AFDSAuth]
---BEGIN SHA1---
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
---END SHA1---

3rd: you have to find the key instead of the Xs
if you don't find a one line key of numbers then you have to re-install it and apply the crack again till you get a working key(sometimes you get a key which is not valid)

4th: copy the key(Ctrl+V)  now, go to Program Files in drive C:/ and change the settings to show hidden folders and enter (InstallShield Installation Information)

5th: search for PMDG installer by entering every folder and opening setup.ini and see PMDG pla pla written in it...

6th: now you will find a similer code or key to the one you've copied from aircraft.cfg.. you will need to add (-) to the copied key.. so 1st, count 8 from the left and put (-) then count 12 from the right and put (-) then in the med just put (-
) every 4 counts like this key I use:
26370DA8-C288-8022-310D-954A-9887-D08D5DDD6B27

after that just replace it with the already found key ( don't forget to replace the one in the below don't remove the {'s 

7th: save it and close the setup.ini.. in the folder you found the setup.ini just go back one step now rename the folder you have been in without removing the {'s

THAT'S IT....


BTW, I've made a vedio on how to do it.. if anyone would like to get...."
,David-7237,2006-10-01T00:41Z,"and I don't think that MAX cracks.... they are just in one file....

,Empress102,2006-10-01T09:17Z,"@ David - I'd like to see the video, to make sure I'm doing this right."

,aviator19,2006-12-24T02:59Z,"I'm having some problem with the PMDG 747...The autopilot will not engage.

1.  On preflight the electrical synoptics displays a message:
""Electrical synoptic inhibited for autoland""

Anytime before takeoff if I pull the disengage bar, I get the master warning and then electrical synoptics displays.

If I don't pull the disengage bar, by the time I leave the ground on takeoff I get the master warning then electrical synoptics displays.

Both times as if autopilot was on already.  On the MCP no CMD buttons were ever on.  I can push all the other buttons and they will work as normal, but no AP.

2.  After the master caution is cancelled or the disengage bar is back up, I can't get the CMD button to light up.  This is pretty much my only problem with both the 747-400 and -400F.

3.  A few months ago when I installed the 744 Everything worked fine.  I logged in about 400 hours.  

I had to reinstall everything on my computer recently and I come up with this one problem. lol.  Well, any advice or procedures are requested if anyone has had the same problem and fixed it.

Thanks in advance"
