,neslesman,2006-10-10T04:18Z,"I think this pack and the All Carenado Aircraft pack are my all time favourite FS9 Aircraft add ons.  Beautiful packages, I just wish this one was seeded, even though I already purchased it, so everyone else could see the beauty and craftsmanship of the PMDG products.

If raf-aldergrove does get all these recent torrents seeded it is a very generous contribution indeed."
,tex99999,2006-12-14T04:08Z,Thanks Aldergrove for this but there is a problem - unless this is validated the MFD screens go blank after a a few seconds. Kinda spoils the whole the hole thing. I guess nothing comes for free.
,whoho,2007-01-06T06:02Z,you are sooo wrong ;)
,dbuster,2007-04-05T14:27Z,Thanks a lot. It is fucking working. Can anyone seed the EZ scenery?? Thanks
,hejmeddig123,2007-07-11T21:58Z,Is this for FS2004 ..?
,xmagnus1,2007-07-14T22:42Z,"Does ""enable button"" work for Windows Vista?"
,kimsangkyu,2007-09-11T04:32Z,how can I download this file? where is the button?
,guybrush_threepwood,2007-09-18T13:02Z,"heres how it ""REALLY"" works...1) run the installer for either of the product, 2)get to the validation page,3)enter a pseudo email, a pseudo order ID (all numbers no strings!), a psuedo password,4) hit ""validate"", an error window will pop up, open the crack folder to run ""enablebutton.exe"" (with administrator rights, if ure on vista!!),get back to the error window and ""ok"" it, hit next, 5)after finishing the installation, just run the flight simulator......====WARNING==== U DONT NEED TO USE THE REGISTRY ENTRY SUPPLIED WITH THIS DOWNLOAD!!!!

PEACE"
,hejmeddig123,2007-10-07T15:36Z,The autopilot dosent work for me..?
,FL280_DCP,2007-10-21T05:14Z,"Omg. Register the fucking aircraft with the REG key file the download comes with to fix the black screens. The autopilot doesn't work if you are below 1200ft, and you have to activate one of the cmds (autopilot switches). And also, PLEASE SEED"

,PilotMilad,2007-11-24T19:15Z,"Why does my screens turn off after like 15 seconds?
Please help, really like this one! :)"
,Pocus1981,2007-12-09T13:15Z,"guybrush's method works for the 747-400 Passenger Version.

Does not work for the Cargo version 747-400f as that does not create a key when you hit the ""validate"" button it simply closes the exe file. 

Has ANYONE found a way around this? I will be in your debt."

,Daniellpilot,2008-06-16T18:34Z,"I saw that a lot of people have problems with he flight cokpit deck actually i can explain why it is happening to you . 1st when you download this go to read the instructions how to install his thing and do step by step not even cancelling any of the steps . Then after while you will need to copy some stuff to the cfg file so that is where the trouble is i guess nobody did that so that is why you can't see the cokpit properly i mean the gauges if you do copy them it will work nicely  "":) any questions ask :)"
,psycoguy2017,2008-06-24T09:41Z,"For some reason, I can't save the aircraft.cfg file after I make the change. I have vista, and I open the file with notepad. Any suggestions?"
,Daniellpilot,2008-06-24T21:00Z,Open aircraft.cfg with notepad or world pad better :) then copy the lkines where are theese supouse to by in the aircraft.cfg and click on cross to exit and it will say save changes or no press yes :) that is it :)

,Shpami,2009-08-15T03:12Z,"Ok guys this is really how you install it

1. Open the installer (with vista run as administrator)

2. Go to the page where you have to add serial and stuff , you can just write random things like 123456789.

3. Then once you have filled in the spaces open crack folder and run the crack  (for vista run as administrator)

Then once you have done that the next button should appear, if it does click it then go on with installation and it should work fine.

yours truly

,aljude,2011-09-20T00:38Z,"Try this to overcome the problem with the MFD's going blank with FS9.. open regedit and look for:
HKEY-LOCAL_MACHINE/Softwear/Microsoft USB Host/Din Controler/cssb2v6
I had 2 cssb2v6 folders with but only one had the data c2e80520102f0800e790160704de90760a1b3801
deleating the one without seems to have cured the problem..."
,gav24088,2011-12-04T01:09Z,"Any one still having problems with the blank PFD screens?  I have 64 bit windows 7 and discovered that the registry has cssb2v6 and lv994r2 located in TWO different locations in the registry. So the c2e80520102f0800e790160704de90760a1b3801
 value has to be entered FOUR times in the registry.  This fixes the problem completely!
regards guys."
