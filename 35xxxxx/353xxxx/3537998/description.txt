This is the sims complete edition. Set contains 4 discs. Cd key is not in manual but if you google sims complete serials youll find a cd key somewhat easily. Im also posting a cd key on www.serials.ws. Follow the directions on the read me and all should be ok. REMEMBER THAT THE CD KEY MUST BE ENTERED IN ALL CAPS!!! I was going to provide a key but chose not to before i zipped the file. you only mount the CCD FILES AND THE MDS FILES IN ORDER!!! It may take a few clicks and it may say you ahve the wrong cd entered but it works!!! you might have to click ok a few times to get it going. If there is further information you feel you need to know email me at

In this pack there are instructions also I am using someone elses disc 1 image so the file is alot larger than it probably would be had I been able to do it with my Disc 1.


Happy Gaming!
