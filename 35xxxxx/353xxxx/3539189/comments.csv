There are by now 37 seeders, and I'm not downloading at all. Weird!"
,futzle11,2007-06-05T04:10Z,"The file is corrupt. DO NOT DOWNLOAD.
Even if you try to convert it with the RAT DVD program, it will not work because it is missing a file that the program needs.
You will be wasting your time - and it is a very slow d/l - to get nothing.
This guy should be banned.
Don't tale my work for it. Look at other sites. They all have problems with this seeder.
It's a bad seed..."
