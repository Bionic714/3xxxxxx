This is a video filmed in New-York by a French Urban Hacktivist Group Ouvresa. There?s an interesting approach to ?Analogical Hacking? on their web site www.ouvresa.tk ,where the production of hacking tools or keys to urbain avdertisment furniture is pursued to question visibilities in the city. Some more videos too?
