,wargen62,2006-09-30T20:18Z,DonÂ´t work.................
[T],AdamSmith377,2006-10-01T03:21Z,"The keygen does work. Open the keygen, scroll down to DVD Ripper 4, press Do It!, copy the registration code and  paste it into the Enter Registration Code part of the program."
,fanch,2006-10-01T10:05Z,"The problem is not with the license code but with the ""Name"" to input in the registration info. The keygen give a code, but what is the Name???"
[T],AdamSmith377,2006-10-01T19:49Z,You can put any name.
,fanch,2006-10-09T20:56Z,any name don't work... Other ideas?
[T],AdamSmith377,2006-10-09T20:58Z,Any name does work!!!
,IdeyaRunes,2006-10-15T06:39Z,"Make sure that you're selecting the correct product on the keygen, ""DVD Ripper 4"" should work for you.  I was also able to use whatever name I had typed into the box.
Thank you for this!!!  I've been fighting with my computer all day and this did the trick.  ^_^"

,Mrmojo5,2006-12-01T17:56Z,I guess the ones having problem with the registration is choosing DVD ripper 4. You should select DVD ripper 4 platinum. Then it works with any name.
