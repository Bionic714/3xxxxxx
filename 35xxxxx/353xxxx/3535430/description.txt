The Clinton Chronicles was originally released in June of 1994. The videotape had a very big impact, according to some, on the 1994 elections. The Chronicles was put together because there were several people, not only in Arkansas, but across the nation, that had documented evidence of criminal activity that involved Bill and Hillary Clinton. That evidence was never allowed to be in court. The media refused to expose this evidence. The people who prepared this film took the time and the effort to allow the people and the investigators involved to bring the evidence to you, the people, to view. What you're about to see you're not going to believe. Some of you will say, "How could this happen?" All I ask you to do is sit back, view what we have and listen to what we have to say. You make your own judgment.
