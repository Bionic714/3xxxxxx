,wargen62,2006-09-30T20:29Z,It doesnÂ´t work
,uraphake,2006-09-30T23:39Z,"Wargen62: I've seen you write the same comment on all of the recent Xilisoft torrents. Like this one, for example. It's been downloaded about 650 times and you're the only one saying, ""It doesn't work."" Are you sure there's not an EBKAC error? [Error Between Keyboard And Chair]
Can anyone else verify if this file works or not?"
[T],AdamSmith377,2006-10-01T03:34Z,All my Xilisoft torrents do work.
[T],AdamSmith377,2006-10-01T03:37Z,wargen62 mate. Learn how to use a computer!!
,uraphake,2006-10-01T04:53Z,"Wargen62: Use the password in the text file for the setup start. Once the app is installed run the keygen. Select from the dropdown the DVD Ripper Platinum 4 and click the button ""Do It.""
On the Xilisoft DVD Ripper screen select ""Help"" and then ""Enter Registration Code."" The ""Name"" field is the same password from the text file. Then copy and paste the registration code from the keygen in the registration code field. You should now have a very nice, working app.

Thanks AdamSmith377! It works great."
[V],Renaissance,2006-10-01T14:43Z,Thanx for sharing ;)
,GokGokMeMok,2006-10-02T06:39Z,Please tell me there is not a trojan in here....major system issues after running.  Data Execution stops on explorer.exe???
,uraphake,2006-10-03T00:12Z,There isn't any trojan in this. I've been using this and it works. It sounds like your machine had other issues which preceeded the installation of this file.
,sandrahp,2006-10-09T15:36Z,I can't get it to work? :( That Keygen doesn't seem to work for me. I don't know why.
[T],AdamSmith377,2006-10-09T21:06Z,"In the keygen scroll down to ""DVD Ripper Platinum 4"" and click ""Do It!"". Copy the code. Open program and go to ""Help"", ""Enter Registration Code"" then enter any name and paste the code created by the keygen."
,fanch,2006-10-09T21:15Z,"""any name"" doesn't do the trick...
so what is the name?"
,Turntable_Terrorist,2006-10-11T01:55Z,Works fine for me.. definitely EBKAC in effect here :) Thanks Adam!
,Snorkfroken,2006-10-11T19:51Z,"How stupid can people get? The ""PASSWORD"" is written in the supplied info file and is ""Xilisoft DVD Ripper Platinum v4.0.56.0928"", the KEYGEN has a drop down where ""DVD Ripper Platinum v4"" should be selected. *sigh*"
,thebiochemist,2006-10-16T23:33Z,"Works great, nice one!"
,dejanifer,2006-10-17T08:47Z,"how many times do you have to click ""do it"" before you get a key code that works. this is taking me forever"
,dejanifer,2006-10-17T09:02Z,i feel like a moron. nevermind
,Glunk,2006-11-13T20:58Z,Thanks. I'm gonna enjoy this one. :)

,ehserti,2006-12-13T22:27Z,"If this works you have made me a very happy man Adam Smith. You have opened up a new world for me. Who made that Key Generator, nice work.

Is there anyone who knows how to convert e. g. .avi files to MPEG4? My SonyEricsson M600i wants that format."

,T4,2007-06-21T22:32Z,"You are right this download has a trojan within my spyware and antivirus detected it.
WARNING"
,kwskategod,2007-07-01T23:47Z,"How do I use the actual ripper?

I open the DVD and there are these ""files""

Title_01
Title_02
Title_03_01
Title_03_02
Title_03_03
Title_03_04
Title_04_01
Title_04_02
Title_04_03
Title_05



Do I rip all of them or just the first one? The first has ""21 Chapters"" and all the others have about 2 each (one has 4) which end up adding up to 20 ""Chapters"""
,smallanditalian5,2007-07-03T01:46Z,Good job guys. Avast found a trojan in the middle of the download. And a very mean one at that. Congrats! You have an infected computer!
,Uncle_Fucker,2007-07-17T13:33Z,"Your Avast is on drugs.
I've been using this since AdamSmith377 uploaded the torrent. It works fine and there are NO FUCKING TROJANS!

Damn bunch of Bozos!"
,Surfdragon,2007-08-01T23:21Z,carefull guys.... this one picked up a trojan according to avast..
,tried.n.tested,2007-08-03T01:51Z,"Spyware Doctor found a Packed/Unpack trojan on the keygen.

,MightyMouse957,2007-08-10T04:40Z,"Thank You tried and tested, Keygen didn't work, though it did come out clean with Zonealarm Internet Security Suite and AVG.

Anyways your first key worked, thanks a lot!"
