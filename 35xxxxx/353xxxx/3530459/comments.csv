	Dear Customer,
 We are writing on behalf of Cox Communications to advise you that we have received a notification that you are using your Cox High Speed Internet service to post or transmit material that infringes the copyrights of a complainant's members.  We have included a copy of the complaint letter.  Pursuant to the provisions of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (""DMCA""), which is codified at 17 U.S.C. § 512, upon receiving such notification, Cox is required to ""act expeditiously to remove, or disable access to"" the infringing material in order to avoid liability for any alleged copyright infringement.  Accordingly, Cox will suspend your account and disable your connection to the Internet within 24 hours of your receipt of this email if the offending material is not removed.
 Please be aware that the DMCA also provides procedures by which a subscriber accused of copyright violation can respond to the allegations of infringement and, under certain circumstances, cause his or her account to be reinstated.  To do so, however, the response must meet certain criteria.  Pursuant to section (g) of the DMCA (17 U.S.C. § 512(g)), you have the right to submit to Cox a counter-notification which, to be effective, must include the following elements:  
 (a)	a physical or electronic signature of the subscriber; 
(b)	identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or disabled; 
(c)	a statement under penalty of perjury that the subscriber has a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled; 
(d)	the subscriber?s name, address, and telephone number and a statement that the subscriber consents to the jurisdiction of the Federal District Court for the judicial district in which the address is located.
 In the event that you submit to Cox a counter-notification that includes these elements, Cox will forward your counter notification to the complainant and advise them that Cox will cease disabling access to the allegedly infringing material in ten (10) business days.  Unless the complainant notifies us that it has filed an action seeking a court order to restrain you from engaging in the allegedly infringing activity prior to the expiration of those ten (10) business days, Cox will reactivate your account.

,Turalyon,2006-11-29T00:30Z,"Don't worry about that UNIVERSAL and their legal threats. If they could have done anything about it they would have ages ago. TPB is hosted in Sweden, Scandinavia, and as of 11.29.06, Sweden is NOT, I repeat NOT a state in the US, so their laws and the so called ""DMCA"" does not apply here. Hell, even the swedish police raided and took a hold of TPB's servers but had ti give em all back with an apology. So, to UNIVERSAL, go fuck yourselves!"
,anla,2006-12-02T11:28Z,Great quality. And Turalyon is right about what he's saying.

,xkexkexke,2008-02-06T20:31Z,"Very nice movie with Jet Li.In this movie Jet Li,who is Huo Yuanjia, 

became famous fighter (martial artist) in all China.
Huo Yuanjia's father did not wish for his child to follow in his 
footsteps,but Huo Yuanjia resolves to teach himself how to fight - and 
finally win. Daily training enable him to ace match after match in his 
home region of Tianjin. After an ill-advised fight leads to another 
master's death, members of Huo's family are slain in revenge. Grieving 
and ashamed, Huo wanders the country in shock. Near death, he is 
rescued by women from an idyllic village, and is offered simple 
kindness and generosity that help him heal and regain his equilibrium 
over a period of several years. Huo realizes that the future of martial 
arts lies in sportsmanship and not brutality, and he rejoins society to 
apply what he has learned. Huo Yuanjia returns to Tianjin, takes steps 
to come to terms with his past and finally restores his family's 
name............For more information go to wing-chunws/Fearless.html"
