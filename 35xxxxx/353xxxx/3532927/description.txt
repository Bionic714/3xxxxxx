Hole In The Wall - Hole In The Wall (1972 Norwegian Country-Rock - 320 kbps)

Norwegian country-rock from 1972. The frontman here is Rune Walle, known best for his later work with Ozark Mountain Daredevils. That should give you some clue to what sort of music this is. Rune Walle also played in a band called ?The Flying Norwegians?, which took its name from Gram Parsons and his Flying Burrito Brothers one assumes.
