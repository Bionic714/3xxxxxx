Splinter Cell Double Agent

Game Notes:    

~~~~~~~~~~~    

When intelligence deemed critical to national security cannot be obtained 
by traditional means, Third Echelon is granted clearance to conduct physical 
operations. Its existence denied by the U.S. government, Third Echelon 
deploys units known as Splinter Cells: elite intelligence-gathering forces 
consisting of a lone field operative supported by a remote team. Like a 
sliver of glass, a Splinter Cell is small, sharp, and nearly invisible.
