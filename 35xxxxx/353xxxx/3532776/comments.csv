,flash_boy,2006-10-05T21:44Z,"Will these eight DVDs contain all 30 episodes of the show? Hence theres only three episodes on this one, if there are going to be three episodes on everey disc, eight DVDs vill contains only 22 episodes.
But thanks anyway, I love this show."
,PEITX,2006-10-06T11:52Z,"DonÂ´t worry, youÂ´ll have all the episodes, maybe in 10 DvDs because the second season will be uploadeb by my friend Alto Voltaje."
