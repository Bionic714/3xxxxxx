This phenomenal album set the standard for electronic music when "new age" was not even in mainstream: it was underground.

This is actually the third incarnation of the epic Wavestar album ?Moonwind?. Having sold out of the second re-press, the album had been unavailable for some time so this chapter is welcome indeed. The album is musically identical to the last release, hence includes the additional track ?For the Whales?. The packaging has been completely revamped and has the sort of presence which an album of this calibre deserves. I don?t believe I?ve actually reviewed this album before hence I approach this opportunity with relish. I took a temporary hiatus from EM during the 80?s and hearing this album around ?88 prompted me to approach the scene with renewed enthusiasm. For a long, long time this was my EM desert island disc. It quite simply contains pure 100% EM of the highest calibre and tackles styles across the spectrum, presenting epic Tangerine Dream style sequencing alongside stunning melodics.
For me the album pivots on 3 key tracks. The opener ?Voyager? is the track I play to people if they ask to hear an example of why I like EM. It is possibly the greatest 12 minute package in EM (New Age synth) history. It opens with drifting spaced out refrains and subtle effects. In the background the sequencing glories to come can be heard in subliminal fashion. At the 5 minute mark those sequences are unleashed to spectacular effect. The way the Digisound Modular?s power is harnessed to produce such hard hitting yet hugely enjoyable rhythms is a stroke of genius. Percussive rhythms explode and focus the beat to produce a hugely impressive backdrop, then John Dyson gets to work on producing some of his infectious lead melodies and we are presented here with some of his finest. They sear through the soundstage and scale seemingly never ending heights. The track seems to peak then goes higher. Why do I like EM? This track has all the answers!

The title piece ?Moonwind? is a brooding masterpiece which displays how effective electric guitar can be melded with synths. The main theme is wonderful and imparts such power and meaning at every turn. I remember lending this album to friend who thought that TD?s demise in the 80?s signalled the end of qquality E-Newage. He returned the album to me almost shaking with excitement, citing this track especially. However, he also did mention the epic ?Chase the Evening?.... No fan of classic TD style sequencing should be without this slab of pulsating electronic rhythmics. Not content with this, further lustre is added with marvellous melodics and massive symphonic escapades. It really is a masterpiece of synthesis, a sentiment which can be extended to the whole album. It?s an album I?ve owned for over 10 year and still look forward to hearing - with, if anything, growing enthusiasm. The more I hear the album the more I realise how much the New Age Synthesizer music genre owes to it. (GG)
