,alien_visitor,2012-06-18T12:11Z,"Does anybody have version which has the ending scene. In it the filming crew finishes work and scenes from the movie are flashing suggesting parallel between the hero and the author of the movie in a way typical for Bergman. Without this scene this scene the sounds of filming crew at the beginning make no sense. I saw it once in cinema, but all torrents I found lack it. "
