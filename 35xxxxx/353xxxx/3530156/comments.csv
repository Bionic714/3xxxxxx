I like to know if Rar-Files have the same qality as Flac-Files or MP3."
,mobio,2008-06-23T04:22Z,"I wouldn't bother with this one unless you like to have all your songs clumped up into one big ass file.  I uncompressed all the parts and it creates two CD images in .nrg format.  After mounting them using Toast, there is only one long .aiff in each CD images.  Once loaded up on iTunes, the entire CD is on one file.

Why not just compress the mp3 in a single rar?"
