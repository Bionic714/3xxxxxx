Was wondering if it would be too much to ask if you have considered placing a smaller version of this, such as a DivX or MP4 version which should come out less than 1.0 GB.

Thanks!"
,FSSR.Keyno,2006-10-12T05:35Z,"Great movie, wish it was NTSC.

I do have a avi,mp3,640x288,1.62gig Vid that i can upload, that looks great on a PC, even at 1680x1050. Wide Screen it is."
,shizilao,2006-10-12T08:06Z,"Just out of curiosity, why didn't you get rid of all audio tracks other than English (or even the DTS one) to preserve a better quality? Anyway, thanks for your efforts. "

Why would you want NTSC? NTSC has wrong video/audio speed and bad picture quality..."
