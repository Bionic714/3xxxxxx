The Departed - CAM-STRESS



Yet another big-production Hollywood remake of a hit Hong Kong film, this time it is 'Infernal Affairs' which starred Andy Lau Tak-wah and Tony Leung Chiu-wai. The plot remains the same: a criminal mole in the police department has to uncover the police mole in the criminal organization, and vice-versa. In the HK version, the undercover police/criminal end up with each other's mobile phones, and the cat-and-mouse game begins. But is either willing to turn on the friends and comrades they've made during their long stints undercover?
