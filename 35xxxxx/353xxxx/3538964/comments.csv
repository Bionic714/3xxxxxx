,D.T.I,2008-10-28T15:45Z,"Hey PLEASE HELP ME...
How do I get my computer to read RAR files?"
,ajamandadam,2008-10-30T03:39Z,"D.T.I.  Download 7-zip and install.Go to folder with RAR/ZIP file(s),open folder and right click on file and select extract here.The data/movie/music or whatever is in the zip,will extract.You can then play that file with whatever media player you have on your pc or burn it with the appropriate software.P.S. 7zip is shareware and is free.You can purchase WinRAR or Winzip which essentially do the same thing.http://www.7-zip.org/ is the link for downloading 7-Zip.Good luck"
