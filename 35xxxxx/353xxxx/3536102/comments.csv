,TMBLOCK285,2009-07-15T12:51Z,Im just getting the hang of this and i would appreciate it. if some one would tell me how to put these files on a dvd. when i download sertin movies it prompts me to insert a dvd and then it burns the movie but some times it has files and im not shure how to but them on a dvd
,guenther3,2009-07-19T05:44Z,TMBLOCK285: you need to download something like deamon tool or winrar. im not very good at eplaining things but basicly u have to extract the files or mount them

V=?"
,pjootor,2009-08-30T10:05Z,"So, you think this is a good release, it's shit - why - cause it's 100 mins long and have 5 spoken language, if u remove 4 that dont really need(and start begin to read those subs) there will be about 2.5 Gb for the movie and thats totally shit. I have 56"" full hd tv and this looks like totally shit in it. Move all exept english language and add all subs, then these movies works. In a 4.7Gb DVD-R disc fits berfecly only 1h26min with 5.1ch movie and about 100 subs !!!!"
,bander49,2009-09-11T15:04Z,"God damnit, stop fucking around!
Can somebody upload a retail release with only english audio?"
[T],minOdroL,2009-09-27T22:37Z,Thanks a lot for the upload!
,cuntsauce,2009-10-11T07:53Z,"Yes! Crappy home cinema equipment is very dependent on the source...  There are other alternatives than complain.

1.) BUY the High quaility retail disk

2.) Replace the crappy player.

""DVD Up-Conversion - The BDP-83 uses the same VRS? by Anchor Bay (DVDO) de-interlacing and scaling technology as in our award-winning DV-983H DVD player. The up-converted picture quality bridges the visual gap from your current DVD library to Blu-ray discs""

- Should be enough for a relative SMALL picture as a 56"". 

3.) Buy the separate unit from Anchor Bay (DVDO)

 Several languages will help more people which will ensure the availability of this download."
,echo873,2010-01-06T20:53Z,Suomenkieli ei ole yhdyssana ja sitäpaitsi senhän saa ihan hakemalla vaikka subtitlesourcesista (subtitlesource.org/title/tt1111422)
,kake91,2010-08-27T20:03Z,where is finnish subs?
,teacheroli,2011-02-01T05:25Z,"Thanks a very lot dude. Propper, fast download, files perfectly prepared to burn on dvd-cd. Do you have more movies? Like ""Charley Varrick"" or ""Hopscotch""? We love these old movies. Again, thanks."
