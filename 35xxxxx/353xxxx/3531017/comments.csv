,retropalace,2008-07-30T23:39Z,"suspect this will fall on deaf ears but please seed! This is such rare stuff that you will only need to seed for a short while to enable the music to be shared!!!!

If you like 80's indie and you are looking for anything I might have it and we could do a swap then it would be worth seeding for a while ... that's what sharing is about....."
