,aptomper,2006-10-06T15:10Z,Does it fit on 1 DVD??
,jmbe,2006-10-06T16:22Z,"No, it wont fit on one DVD. I didnÂ´t recompress it, just stripped everyting but the movie and menus or it would be 8.5 GB. You have to recompress it using your preferred software"
,jmbe,2006-10-08T09:16Z,"Sorry guys, I discovered that for some reason the DTS stream is still in there. Just strip it out and it will fit on one DVD. Sorry for the inconvenience.
