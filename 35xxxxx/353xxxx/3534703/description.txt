DEAD MAN WALKING (RE-ANIMATED)

THIS DEMO STARTED OUT AS A ONE OFF MIX FOR A FRIENDS CHRISTMAS. IT WAS NOT INTENDED TO BE UPLOADED TO THE INTERNET, BUT IT EVENTUALLY FOUND IT?S WAY THERE. IT HAS FOUND NOTERIETY WITHIN THE REEFER COMMUNITIES OF THE WORLD, AND IS OFTEN PLAYED AT CHILL-OUT SESSIONS. IT IS MUCH SOUGHT AFTER BECAUSE OF IT?S MUCH DEBATED WHACKINESS.

IT?S WAY OUT THERE MAN!!!!!
