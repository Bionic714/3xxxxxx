,legendary_goku,2006-10-13T12:41Z,"Fraps sucks....

Making a simple video of a few minutes already takes more then 1 gig even more then 2 gigs for 5 minutes....

i Tried 2.6 but just as usual it sucks too bad though it could have been good....

For the people who have bought fraps well they all regret it...."
,mon0x1d3,2006-10-15T06:32Z,"legendary, fraps records a raw .avi, you're supposed to use that and put into a video editing program to edit and compress/render to a normal .avi or whatever file type you want."
,Eara,2006-10-15T18:35Z,how do i use this File??? What can i do with it?
,Eara,2006-10-15T18:36Z,Send an Message to me if you know how
,legendary_goku,2006-10-15T22:05Z,Yeah i know but it's not only that...it's hyard on the fps too.... i'd recommend using easy video capture the quality is as good as fraps but the file size is like 100 times smaller...too bad that program isn't freeware
