Some Beatles CD Covers.  May Be Useful To Some Of You.

A 7 1/2 i.p.s tape of Jeff Waynes Musical version of War Of The Worlds has come my way but it does not have the Richard Burton Commentry.  It seems, to me, to be the same mix as 2 LP and 1 LP (highlights) versions But is one long track.  If anyone wants it leave a comment and I will prepare it for upload in a week or two.
