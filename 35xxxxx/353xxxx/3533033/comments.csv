,BlackEight,2006-10-03T17:16Z,"joe81, I could upload an image of the Dreamfleet CD,but believe me, 90% of it is already included in this one. I don´t know if it uses Securom. I f you REALLY want the CD, I will upload it later this week."
,blankbox,2006-10-03T19:00Z,"joe_81 

am I missing something here? This up is 21 files...3 of em are the 727 can't you pick them and leave the rest?????"
,BA331,2006-10-03T21:09Z,"Thx for this Blackeight

REQUEST: FFS Saab 340 please =)"
,BlackEight,2006-10-03T22:53Z,"A fact: from the last 20 peers that downloaded the whole file, not a single one seeds it now. Am I supposed to seed eternally? This site is full of leechers. I think that PB guys here should develop a Banning system based on U/L ratios,...
Request, request, request, yes,..sure...."
,mad_flyer,2006-10-04T20:14Z,@David: The very same happens to me!! I have tried the 727-200 and it gives me a CTD too. Does any one know what's going on?
,McPorra,2006-10-04T20:28Z,"Thx 4 the upload, BlackEight. I selected the Super80 only and after install, following the instructions the panel would not work. I had to substitute the gauge file with a cracked one that I had... If you have the Super80 CD, could you upload it? TIA"
,McPorra,2006-10-04T20:33Z,daveislander and mad_flyer: the EXE file if extrated from the CD will probably not work. You need the CD for a correct installation.
,mad_flyer,2006-10-04T21:20Z,"@McPorra: Damn, that sucks. I guess I'll try unwrapping with the Flight1 Unwrappers. "
,BlackEight,2006-10-04T21:33Z,"Ummm, I might upload the CD images of both products if you want them. No problem."
,McPorra,2006-10-04T21:53Z,"BlackEight, your effort will be much appreciated. TIA"
,mad_flyer,2006-10-04T22:01Z,Indeed they will! Thanks!!
,Carbamide,2006-10-04T22:03Z,Glad I'm not the only one that that's happening to.
,BlackEight,2006-10-04T22:27Z,"OK, I will upload both the 727 and the Super80 CD Images tomorrow. So that you can burn or mount them and avoid the wrapper. Sorry."
,Carbamide,2006-10-05T00:08Z,"With your permission, sir, I would like permission to stop seeding, since this *doesn't work*.

,alosh747,2006-10-13T14:09Z,"after downloading of b727 from this torrent,everything is ok.livery packs installed goog but during the installation,the message ""some files are write protected ""appeared,by accepting overwrite them,the final result was after running the program in fs9,it autoshutdowened. it means 
it was not cracked completely? waiting for your comments  guys"
,meskalamdug,2007-02-24T05:09Z,Which version of DF 727 ? version 2 ? It's important !
,meskalamdug,2007-02-24T05:15Z,"Does SP1 for Super80 works without crack ? for unwraped version ( using f1_loader version 3.8 ) SP1 makes a new ""super80.gau"" file version 1.0.2.0 and needs to be cracked . perviousely cracked one is version 1.0.0.1 ."
,zukito,2007-11-15T02:19Z,some seed plsssssssss
