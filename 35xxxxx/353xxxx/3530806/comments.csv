,eagle104,2006-09-29T18:41Z,The audio is off on this movie. Funny how the sample he shows doesnt have anyone talking. Dont bother with Dload. Come aXXo  give us a good copy soon!
,ticktock_man,2006-09-30T23:03Z,"is the audio really off on this? or is it another case of a n00b without the right codecs or a shitty divx player inadvertantly nuking an otherwise good release?
can anyone confirm?"
,eagle104,2006-10-01T09:07Z,"I'm telling you it is. I have several players. And I have dloaded alot of movies. The audio is off. I wish it wasnt, I would like to watch it. And you dont see me commenting this on any other movies on TPB."
,digby5,2006-10-02T16:56Z,"Yes, the audio is out of sync. However, you can just use nandub/virtualdub to re-sync with 500ms and the audio will be alright."
,digby5,2006-10-02T17:12Z,That's -500ms
,magliteswe,2006-10-02T18:18Z,Ljudet ur sync....instämmer med föregående talare...alltså tack för UL men ffs kolla innan.
