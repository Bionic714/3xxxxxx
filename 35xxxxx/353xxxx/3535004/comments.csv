,206frosty,2009-09-14T11:50Z,"Tournament of the Gods (????II) by Takehiro Nakayama is a 3-episode anime OVA series based on a H-game of the same name.

From the back of the DVD:

In a far away land, in a far away time, the greatest fighters of the land meet to do battle. Accompanied by a beautiful female partner, they test their might in the gladiatorial arena. To the victor go the spoils, including the partner of the vanquished!

But when Sid enters the tournament, he discovers the evil hidden at its heart. Shortly after he is crowned champion, the lethally lovely Aquross infects him with a hideous disease that requires him to steal the life force of Angels or be in constant unbearable pain.

The only relief lies in an insidious drug that kills the pain, but causes sexual urges that cannot be denied. Now, in-between bouts of unimaginable agony and savagely intense sex, Sid must defeat the evil Aquross and end the Tournament of Gods forever!
