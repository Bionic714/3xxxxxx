,Eagle-Leader,2006-10-09T22:54Z,"Why thinking it is a virus? It is just 700 games on 93,62 MiB....OK, get the point? But i haven't tested to download it, so i can't say for sure."
,konjo,2006-10-15T16:56Z,dude seems like a virus: Why in the world would you put 700 flash files into an exe? So you can hide a virus. If not you would compress them into a zip and export the .fla files :-P. All I am saying is I aint clicking it till someone verifies that this isn't a virus.
,Henkect,2006-12-10T09:06Z,"dude, 906 people have downloaded this file, if it were a virus they would have said something"
,langaren99,2007-11-19T20:38Z,no virus in the download but only old flash games
