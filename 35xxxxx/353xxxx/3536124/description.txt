A Great Movie about two teenagers with genius IQs who run away to Venice, Italy to, according to legend, kiss under the Bridge of Sighs in a gondola so that their love will last forever. Sir Laurence Olivier play a gentle, kind pickpocket who helps them on their journey. WONDERFUL MOVIE!

Including the CD of the Motion Picture Soundtrack, very hard to find!. Music was composed by Georges Delerue, who won the 1979 American Academy Award for \\\"Best Original Score\\\". It is very beautiful and much deserved the award! Influences include French, Italian, and a touch of Italian jazz!
