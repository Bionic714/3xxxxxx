[V],firbie,2006-10-21T02:13Z,"thank you very much Mr. Fear for the uploads of tos. I did enjoy it. 
As for the remark of Ursule. Season one of ds is dead for quite some time. Three left at 99,9%. And season one of the Enterprise have no Dutch subs, so who knows in the future.
Anyhow this one is complete and I am very greatful."
,uhura,2006-10-21T18:36Z,Do any of you guys have a url to a complete set of covers if TOS? cdcovers.cc is not complete...

,younso,2007-05-22T07:44Z,where are the seeders?! We are stuck at 96%! Please!
,Mopper,2007-05-26T13:39Z,"Yeah ... pls seed , stuck at 99,6 % ..."
,Mopper,2007-05-27T12:09Z,"It's in , thanx , I should be more patience , I will seed for a week."
,Braindrained,2008-03-09T12:34Z,Please seed
,capnpat,2008-08-14T15:23Z,"Thx Mr_Fear, but where have all the seeders gone???  I've been patiently grabbing Season 2 and 3 over the last few weeks and always UL at least 3 times what I DL and usually seed after that for another 2x the DL size.  These last 2 discs of season 3 are being a real pain though - not moving at all from around 50 and 60%.  Too bad."
,linux_terror,2008-09-21T17:02Z,PLEASE PLEASE SEED(at more than 1k/s)
,capnpat,2008-09-24T15:43Z,"Well, over a month later and I finally have disc6 but disc7 is worse than painfully slow...started this DL on July 25th and still haven't even broken 77%...is the single seeder I see on this on a dial-up connection or something???  I mean, c'mon there has to be more people out there who have DL'd this and could seed it faster than this....  :-("
,capnpat,2008-09-26T15:34Z,"To whomever graciously hopped on the pipe and seeded sometime between yesterday afternoon and right now, thank you thank you thank you.  Oh, did I mention thank you?  100% and will continue seeding (at 200K) 'til my share ratio is 10:1, simply as a thanks to anyone and everyone who hung in there on this DL."
,jimrude,2009-05-21T13:33Z,I'm at 99.28% . Could someone please seed for an hours or so and then I'll continue seeding
,BookRaider,2009-06-01T12:37Z,"I started downloading + seeding TOS the 15. of January. I still only have 7 complete downloads out of the 22 discs. Just like Capnpat and Jimrude, I've decided to keep seeding (at a lot more than 1kpbs :) for at least a year after completion, so please help me finish? I'd like to watch the series myself again soon, too :)"
,BookRaider,2009-06-01T12:46Z,"Very sry to add a PS, but I forgot: Yes, I have 95G hdd space that I've decided to use for nothing but seeding TOS for at least a year from dl finishes ;)"
