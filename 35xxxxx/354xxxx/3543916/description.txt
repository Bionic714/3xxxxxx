A cover band that manage to sound a lot like Metallica while merging Metallica with the Beatles. 

Classics like 
Sgt. Peppers Lonely Harts Club Band become Sgt. Hetfields Motorbreath Pub Band
Hey Jude becomes Hey dude
I want To Hold Your Hand becomes I Want To Choke Your Band
A Hard Days Night becomes A Garage days Night
We Can Work it Out becomes We Can Hit the Lights

All played in a Metallica style with a very good James Hetfield. A must for any fans with a sense of humour.
