Thank you so much Shojin, I've been a long time PirateBay user, and I just had to register and thank you for this torrent.   :D

Is it too much to say that right now at 3am where I live you ARE my God! :D"
,Shojin,2006-10-26T12:01Z,"NP ^^, enjoy.  We should have another seeder by tomorrow, he has a much faster up speed than me."
,Liekki,2006-10-26T12:02Z,"Hehe, same here as Ziggarius. I registered just to thank you, now if I manage to download this, I will be seeding it at least few days if not a week.

Awesome job!"

,zhanghno11,2006-10-26T12:10Z,"VIVA?I regested for thanks too! Shojin ,thank u very very much!!"

,Joeoski,2006-10-26T12:49Z,Thank you  Shojin was trying to dl the other one for ever i'll seed i over 2x thank you 
,KOLOFON,2006-10-26T13:24Z,It be nice if u seed man!!
,Shojin,2006-10-26T13:29Z,"Yes please seed when you finish, we desperately need seeders."
,Rip-Saw,2006-10-26T14:47Z,I don't think Sega really cares if people torrent this. And why should they when we'll be forking out monthly fees? Any BlueBurt players here I'd know?
,isomake,2006-10-26T14:48Z,Hey is this really full version and work this??
,casalmm,2006-10-26T14:53Z,why this torrent not is very fast like other 5g? 
,casalmm,2006-10-26T14:54Z,"the other 5g torrent dow=280k, this torrent =3k :("
,spookyg,2006-10-26T15:01Z,We're all stuck at 26.7%. Please come back and seed!
,delukard7,2006-10-26T15:15Z,shojin we're all stuck at 27% is something wrong?
,Shojin,2006-10-26T15:20Z,"Go back to the old one, this one got fed up, dont ask me how, I have no idea, all the files matched up the same size, but it was my fault for not going all the way through ,for that I appologize.  I have no way of getting the 5 gig on to anyone any faster, I just dont know what to do.  With the 5 gig one you;ll have to extract it from the iso to make it work.

Please forgive me, this has never happend to me before.. I'm sorry."
,bfcake45,2006-10-26T15:25Z, are you going to be seeding the 5 gig version?
,delukard7,2006-10-26T15:38Z,shojin decide please wich one will you seed?
,shunohoko,2006-10-26T15:52Z,"After reading the PC Tech support forum on the sega PSU message board there is no way I'd ever pay 50 bucks for this.

Shojin thank you very much for sharing your full copy with us it is much appreciated, I registered just to show my gratitude."
,shunohoko,2006-10-26T15:53Z,"Oops, for the 2 guys above me I doubt he's going to be seeding the 5 gig, your best bet is to just get the compressed."
,bfcake45,2006-10-26T16:04Z,shunohoko: read shojins previous comment...
,Trollhammer13,2006-10-26T16:06Z,:(:(:(

,Overlord123,2006-10-26T16:13Z,"I'll be waiting for this one:

,shunohoko,2006-10-26T16:27Z,"Thanks bfcake45 for pointing that out to me.

God damnit."
,Shojin,2006-10-26T16:40Z,"Okay, WinHUA apparently lied to me, totally screwed this one up.  Man this makes me look bad, but eh too good to be true.  Apparently it counted setup bin 2 and 3 as null data and snipped it, which would explain the extreme compression.  So ya, moral of the story don't use WinHUA, unless you're burning an iso from a disc that didnt use the full disc and you have null data.

Ya... Please dont hate me ; ;, see http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3545669/US_Phantasy_Star_Universe.iso

*dodges angry mob*"
,Macman430,2006-10-26T19:49Z,You could just... use WinRAR on it; it's an awesome tool
,Marcus_nr1,2006-10-31T13:06Z,can i play this game offline?
,Infected2005,2006-11-01T18:41Z,"Hi, i have a problem, i mounted the .iso with Daemon tool, the installation was successfull, but when i try story or network mode, i have an error : GAME HACK DETECTED, and then the game close. I didn't change any file. Someone can help me on that ? thkx"
,Naffnuff,2007-01-31T09:43Z,"5 GB -> 1,2 GB?
Did you really believe that?
Look, morons. The files on a game DVD are already compressed, so there's nothing for programs like winrar to get rid of.
I've seen a million of these retarded uploads on TPB.
How many times can you get disappointed?"
