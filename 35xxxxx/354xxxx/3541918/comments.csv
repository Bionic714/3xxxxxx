,S!indÂ®e,2006-10-31T18:27Z,You must have AOE III...This is the Expension pack
,dwatch,2006-11-04T12:39Z,"you must have the UN-cracked version of the original game installed. The expansion verifies the game exe file that you cracked, and if it can't find the real one, it wont install. for all you guys who craked the original game and didn't keep a backup copy, you might have to re-install the original game, install this expansion, then put back your cracked game exe files."
,henkepilsner,2006-11-08T17:28Z,Let there be a lesson always keep a backup of the original exe-file. Always good for updating and stuff.

,beerdude22,2007-08-26T16:19Z,"FAQ:
------
Q: Do I need AoE 3 to install this? 
A: Yes, you do! This is the expension set to AoE III.

Q: When I try to install the this expension, I get a error saying that I need AoE 3 installed, but I already got it, help!

A: You need the REAL AoE3 .exe. Not a cracked one. To solve this, replace the old exe, or reinstall AoE 3, then install this one, THEN apply the crack for this game."
