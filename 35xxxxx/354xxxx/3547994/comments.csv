,eldard,2007-04-22T03:15Z,The quality sucks after converting to DVD.
,crozierj,2007-08-04T16:50Z,What did you use to convert to DVD?  All the converters I try reject most of these files.
,Tooshyguy454,2007-12-18T07:36Z,"Good video and sound quality.  

I'm watching these on a 22"" widescreen with 1680 X 1050 resolution and I'm more than happy with them.  

In case anyone is wondering, they are all in english with no subtitles.  The quality is probably good enough to convert to DVD and watch on a normal TV if needed.  Thanks to the uploader!"
,joe180,2008-04-17T03:07Z,Are these Xvid or DivX?
,senseless06,2010-02-19T02:20Z,"
Not sure what whacked codec was used to encode these. A+ for effort, F for practicality. I don't understand why they were just coded in 350mb xvid files (like every other series and movie released in the past 10 years). But some feel the need to reinvent the wheel I guess.

After spending about 5 hours trying to get these files to play, I gave up. Gspot was unable to determine codec, the best I could get was audio only via ogg codecs.
