,colimodio,2006-10-17T21:33Z,just got FSX deluxe edition. IT will NOT install. on the 2nd DVD the installation freezes...i'll have to go back to the demo....:(
,barp,2006-10-17T21:36Z,"@colimodio:
i think you might have downloaded the 8GB torrent,both the cd's, am i correct?
if so, then delete the first cd, and download the Razor's cd1 repack."
