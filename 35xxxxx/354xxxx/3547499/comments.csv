,Hosee221,2007-02-03T09:19Z,"I installed the game with the instructions that came with the game. I mounted the image to PowerISO and installed it. Then i opened the program ""Patch ITG2.exe"" And installed it. And finally, i opened the ""Crack.bat"" file. I left it running til' its end.
I cant see the music files in the game. Instead of them, there is all ""Empty"". What should i do? I mean, the songs are in their right place's,
in the groove/songs/in the groove/...
in the groove/songs/in the groove2/...
in the groove/songs/in the groove3/...
...= song files
PLZ, HELP ME, answer to adress hosee221@msn.com"

,ytzone,2012-05-20T02:11Z,"If anyone still needs help installing it, follow these steps:

1. Install ITG.nrg with DAEMON Tools Lite or any other mounting program
2. Use bepower_warez CD-KEY (AA4BG-AAHFU-4DZAO-VLILK-4ARCR)
3. Install the ITG2 Patch.
4. IGNORE THE CRACK FOLDER.  It'll just screw the game up.
5. If you want to unlock all the songs, enter this code in the main menu: Left Down Up Down Right Down Up Down Left Up Down Up Right Up Down Up"
