,poke_master,2006-10-30T15:12Z,is these episodes encoded by (c_p)? or is it just bad cuality encodes?
[T],nskid11,2006-10-30T19:14Z,"I belive alot of them was encoded by Cartoon World, some of them may of been C_P but i couldn't say for sure as i re-named most of them when I got them, but they are all good, don't think there are any bad ones in it."
[T],nskid11,2006-11-04T11:01Z,"Be patient, I've uploaded 1.603 times the file size and there still only 0.86 of the file on other peoples computers, no one but me has a full copy yet and my 40Kb/s upload speed can only do so much. But with any luck there will be a full copy up by the end of today, so long as my connection doesn't play up."
[T],nskid11,2006-11-04T17:36Z,"I rename the files when i download them according to my fileing system, I wasn't expecting to upload them again, but the episode number are according to http://www.serebii.net/. Which I believe is based on all episodes ever shown, which means the numbering includes episodes shown in Japan and not the US, but doesn't include episode banned world wide.

If you don't like the file naming rename them yourself, its not like anyone else bothered to upload the full series since the 3 months I've had it. File names themselves have no effect on a torrent, you can happily rename the file then tell Azureus to re target the file and it will download or seed fine.

But if your talking about who encoded it, most good encoders put there name on the first frames of the video itself rather then just in the name which can be changed."
