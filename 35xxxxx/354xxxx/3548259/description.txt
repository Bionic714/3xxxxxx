*** JUST WHAT IS THIS TORRENT? ***
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Some folks seem to think that my NFO's are a bit vague, so here is the lowdown 
on this DVD. It's a fan edit of Star Wars Episode Two. 


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*** FEATURED FAN EDITED FILM ***
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


STAR WARS
Episode II: The Gathering Storm

There is unrest in the Galactic Senate. Several thousand solar systems have 
declared their intentions to leave the Republic. This separatist movement, under 
the leadership of the mysterious Count Dooku, has made it difficult for the 
limited number of Jedi Knights to maintain peace and order in the galaxy. 
Senator Amidala, the former Queen of Naboo, is returning to the Galactic Senate 
to vote on the critical issue of creating an ARMY OF THE REPUBLIC to assist the 
overwhelmed Jedi...

This fan edit of George Lucas's second Star Wars prequel offers a streamlined 
take on the courtship of Anakin Skywalker and Padme Amidala, along with Anakin's 
first steps towards the dark side.  Notable changes include an overhaul of the 
central love story, the re-introduction of deleted scenes featuring Padme's 
family, restructuring to increase momentum in the film's middle third, the 
excision of 'death sticks' and C-3PO's antics in the droid factory, and as 
always... less talking.   

No scene has been left untouched.
 
Special thanks to the crew at originaltrilogy.com, Rikter, and especially my 
friends for their interest in the project. 

And to my dad for instilling in me a frighteningly single-minded love for Star 
Wars.

efforts, Fan created Edits, OUT-OF-PRINT titles or titles that are not YET 
available on any "Official" currently produced DVD, Laserdisc or VHS release. We 
will not offer any titles that are copies of available "Official" DVD's via 
torrent or trade. SO PLEASE purchase or acquire via trade any OFFICIAL copies of 
these titles when possible (i.e. Laserdisc, VHS, CED or DVD) 

Information in any torrent posted by Blaksvn-Torrentz that is NOT 100% accurate 
will be corrected. I will update that information with what I believe is the 
correct information when it is passed on to me. I will ALWAYS give the proper 
credit WHEN I have this information. If I need to "attach" credit to an existing

and include any proper NFO, TXT or Word DOC that you may have so that I can 
include this information with any future Torrent releases.

SO, if I post a torrent and I have NO information about said torrent - I will 
post what information I have via an NFO; if the release does not already have a 
known title or name, I will again place a temporary name on the set until a 
correct name can be established. - I will no longer use any information gathered 
from any forums or newsgroups as this information will be considered strictly 
hearsay (unless the information is posted by the KNOWN source then it can be 
called canon). Again I will ALWAYS try to give the proper credit but this is 
only possible when I have this information.

ALL Personal information (i.e. emails, names, dates and places) will ALWAYS
