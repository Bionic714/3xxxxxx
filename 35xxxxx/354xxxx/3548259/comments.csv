Looking forward to seeing this version"

,Kaspar4283,2006-11-01T19:57Z,"Great, thx!"
,wabbitman,2006-11-02T02:27Z,"Wouldn't it be a good idea to limit the number of upload slots a little more if you're the single seeder? It's gotta be faster for everyone if a few peers get the whole thing as soon as possible so they can help seed.

Anyways thanks for the edit and upload, I haven't seen any of these fan edits but it sure sounds like an improvement!"
,jeronimo10,2006-11-06T23:01Z,Pleaze keep on seeding! Thnx!

,micleg,2006-11-15T21:44Z,"On my Panasonic S49 it feels like the movie is running at 15 fps or so. Not running too slow, just with too few frames. Anyone else getting that feeling?"
