,loco,2006-10-17T20:45Z,Anyone got the rest of the series?
,anuskasvo,2006-10-17T22:14Z,"THANKS so much!!! This is super funny show, a true classic..."
,flamboyant,2006-10-18T06:39Z,"Thanks a lot, Tsaparang! If you have any more episodes, please upload them! :-)"
,Tsaparang,2006-10-20T17:24Z,"In answer to flamboyant's question, I do have at least 9 episodes from series 2 and 3 (Spring and Autumn 1980) plus some compilations broadcast in 1981.  I didn't bother recording the first series back in 1979, because I didn't think it worth using up an expensive video tape.  I'll start uploading a batch of 1980 programs when the 1982 Series 4 torrent has reached 100%.  Please re-seed for fellow enthusiasts so I can start the next torrent and be patient!  With any luck I'll start the next upload in a few days time.   Enjoy."
,Tsaparang,2006-10-22T18:02Z,"I have posted some more Not The 9 O'Clock News episodes from the 1980 series, but due to my lack of familiarity with this site, I ended up giving the new torrent a very ambiguous title.  If you want to download the next set of files, search for ""Four episodes from 1980 - Series 2 and 3 - Part 1"".  Sorry about the mix up, but I was getting Invalid Tracker and Bad Code messages, when I tried to upload the tracker.  Next time I'll get it right!"
,nickdoofah,2006-11-18T17:00Z,thank you for these :-)
,justsmile,2007-08-25T13:36Z,"Thanks a lot for this!  I am looking for the 'Not The Nine O Clock News' record or tape which features the hospital bed bidding sketch, gerald the gorilla, and which starts with some mention of how much great value the BBC licence fee is...  Any got this please?  I would love to get it back..  Had it once but lost it in a house move sometime."
,Tsaparang,2008-03-20T15:43Z,"In answer to Justsmile, I don't think the hospital bed sketch is in any of the five torrents I uploaded in October 2006, but Gerald the Gorilla is certainly included somewhere amongst them, so check out the other torrents if you don't have them all.  I'm continuing to seed (very slowly) to keep the five torrents alive and have now uploaded 105GB in total!!!  I'd appreciate it if other people did the same so everyone can enjoy them.  I was very pleased my original tapes have survived so well after all these years."
,Tsaparang,2008-09-02T23:15Z,"This torrent died recently due to lack of interest (or seeders).  I've uploaded it 16 times (30GB) but have only minimal bandwidth.  If you're really desperate, post your request here and I'll reseed again, but only slowly. "
,Tsaparang,2012-01-08T23:54Z,"If anyone is really desperate to complete the download of this torrent, I might be persuaded to dig out the files I created from my original Betamax tapes and reseed for a short period.  Post a comment here and I'll check periodically."
