,extrudedplasticdingus,2006-10-26T23:44Z,This doesn't appear to be seeded at all.  I've had it running six minutes and it hasn't downloaded anything.
,nanaem,2006-10-27T00:40Z,"holy crap, this is an awsome upload... thx alot! :)"
,dahulk12,2006-10-27T03:00Z,"extrudedplasticdingus, I can upload torrents, I can seed the torrents, but I can't control WHO connects,  WHEN they connect, or HOW FAST they get to connect. Sorry. Keep trying if you still haven't connected. Others are DL from me now so I know it is being seeded. ENJOY!"

,VladimirLem,2011-06-23T07:13Z,"im download at 600k+ with 4 seeders and 4 peers.  Thank you guys very much.  Been looking for this for ages,  at least a torrent thats being seeded.  I will seed for 2 weeks once completed."
,VladimirLem,2011-06-23T07:15Z,"Correction:  And mind you,  i'm currently downloading a few other torrents,  so speed would moist likely increase once im finished downloading them.  I get slower speeds leeching for 30+ seeders and peers.  Thanks again everyone."
,a_goddly82,2011-08-25T16:04Z,"Looks Excellent..  will seed, much appreciated!"
