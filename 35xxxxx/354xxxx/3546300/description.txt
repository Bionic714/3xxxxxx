Now, just to keep you busy this weekend to celebrate Halloween here in the States, and for those outside America, to enjoy some more about GHOSTS, I\\\'m uploading a few more goodies!:

THE WORLDS SCARIEST GHOSTS CAUGHT ON TAPE
AVI, 40 minutes, MP3 audio, DivX encoded
Cool AVI file of TV show I found with eerie scens of REAL footage of people\\\'s furniture moving on its own, and one scene where someone took a photograph of an abandon house found in the woods, and when the picture was processed, shown a ghostly figure with a skull-like face!

MIDNIGHT SYNDICATE -BORN OF THE NIGHT
CD music MP3s = 320 kbps
MIDNIGHT SYNDICATE are a group who makes spooky music which is often played outside of haunted houses to the people as they wait in line to get inside the attraction. Very Cool SPOOKY MUSIC!

SPOOKY SOUTHCOAST INTERVIEWS BRIAN FROM \\\"TAPS\\\" (GHOST HUNTERS TV SHOW)
Recorded this from the Internet. Spooky Southcoast is a radio program that broadcasts every Saterday night. They interview Brian from TAPS (Ghost Hunters). Cool parts to listen for is when Brian tells of the time he went on an investigation with Keith and an old woman becomes POSESSED and her eyes, ALL of her eyes!, turn black and she starts cursing and laughing hysterically at Brian! He says he started yelling for Keith! COOL!

And last, but not least,...

ART BELL -GHOST TO GHOST RADIO BROADCASTS FROM 1996 TO 2005
Art had his own radio broadcast and would, about once a year, mostly in October to celebrate Halloween, allow ordinary people call in and tell their own ghost stories, personal stories of ghostly things that have happened to them. This show was broadcast ALL NIGHT so it was always a little eerie to listen to some of these peoples stories at night, in the dark. These are RANDOM files I have put together, some with the commercials intact, others with the commercials edited out. Some of these broadcast will last about 3 to 4 hours.

ENJOY! 
HAPPY HALLOWEEN!
