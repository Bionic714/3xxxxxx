Note to self, dont bother with catkillererer torrents. ......"
,morpheuscool,2006-10-31T22:43Z,I will never dl something from catkillerer again
,jediwillow,2006-11-01T00:28Z,"killerfox it took only 12 min to download for you, cause you jumped on this when it well seeded. But for the rest of us that were here for days d/l this...we have been fooled. Considering no other decent tracker site had this game...I was fooled by Catkillererer. That is the last straw for TPB for me....this site has become obsolete."
,jediwillow,2006-11-01T00:40Z,"did u also notice that the game size is supposed to be 932mb...but for some reason it showed up at 1.03gb on azureus. Something is not right. By the way I will hunt & kill you Catkillererer, unless a fix is upped in the next 10sec.....10...9....8....7....6...5...4...3 1/2......3 1/4.....damn u"
,travmax,2006-11-01T08:31Z,"It took me almost a week to download, a fix is needed ASAP!!!!! If anyone has successfully unpacked it please post the solution. Cheers. 

P.S- catkillererer is an absolute disgrace"
,horvnandi,2006-11-03T12:26Z,"Kösz, hogy az elbaszott feltöltéseddel növeled az oldal megbízhatatlanságát catkillerer. Legközelebb nézd meg mit töltesz fel! te tetü"
,IlyDemon,2006-11-03T17:44Z,"Maybe we should ban catkillererer from this website.  I mean does he really kill poor little cute defenseless kittens in his spare time (or full time maybe).
FOOL....... dont upload files if they take so long, and after all that, they're bloody corrupt.
Shame on you, you damn idiot............."
,IlyDemon,2006-11-03T17:45Z,CAN ANYONE ELSE GET THIS GAME FOR US........ HORSE RACING GAME I BELIEVE.
