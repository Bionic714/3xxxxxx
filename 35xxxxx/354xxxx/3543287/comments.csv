[T],TaurusKJ,2009-04-12T06:40Z,"Yo, Ihlavine! You don't have to wait for the NTSC USA copy of this movie.  Just get the other torrent listed:

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4595599/Yentl

Then all you do is the following.

First, you need to get and install these:

DaemonTools or PowerISO (or some other program to open the image file. I use daemon).
DVD Shrink 3.2

Mount the image file with daemon tools.
Open DVD Shrink.
Select Open Disc.
Find Yentl on virtual drive that daemon tools uses.
After analyzing, click Backup!
On next window, click on DVD Region tab, and make sure Region Free is selected.
Click ok, then let it do it's thing.
When it's done you should have a DVD that will play in almost any player.

Let us know if it works for you!  : )"

[T],TaurusKJ,2011-02-26T22:59Z,"@Fatherballbag: Wow! I guess the link is dead! That is unfortunate. I will try to find my copy of it and repost in the near future.  In the meantime, you need to work on your name calling dude....."
[T],TaurusKJ,2011-03-07T18:14Z,"I have returned, and I see that the comment I left for Fatherballbag is no longer here, so he must of deleted his account.  Before that happend, he left some choice words saying that the suggested link in my earlier comment is no longer in service.  I have now reposted the movie I originally recieved by said link, and you can get that here:
