What is Microbia?

Microbia is the initiative of two newcomers to the film making world. Both filmmakers work with new media and enjoy experimenting within the crossover frontiers of animation and live action. Microbia\'s aim is to provide a platform whereby they can share not only their individual work but also joint projects with a wider audience. 

 
Who is Microbia?

Microbia is Floris Kaayk and Sil van der Woerd; both friends since childhood. Floris is currently studying at the St Joost Academy in Breda and Sil at the Academy for Art and Design in Arhnem. Both institutions are in The Netherlands. 
Artists Statement

For Floris and Sil, Microbia, is their own fictitious world within which they choose to work. This world originates from the micro-cosmos environment of bits and bytes that form the basis for the creation of a boundless utopia
