Whoch concludes the 'original' Asterix serie; another bunch of episodes were wrtitten by Uderzo alone after Goscinny's death, still funny, but not quite the same great quality. I'll upload those too anyways, as soon as my Freenet downloads are done.

You have to edit that to a working address, I though that making it ""unintresting"" for link-collecting bots would be a good thing. freenetnet"
,LucisFerens,2006-11-01T17:30Z,"Well... actually, I can't really say which episodes ends Goscinny's production, maybe because right after he died, Uderzo may have used some unpublished material to make another couple of episodes, so the quality doesn't really drop down from one episode to the next one, the change is more gradual, but you can surely notice there is quite a difference between ""Asterix chez Razahade"", ""Asterix la Rose et le Glaive"" and the first say 20 episodes, while other episodes published after Goscinny died are bascially the same quality as before. The first couple of them, at least."
