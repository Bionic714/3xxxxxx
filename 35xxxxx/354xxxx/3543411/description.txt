The Ackermans-No One Knows Us Better Than The Ackermans (2004) indie/garage




Sweden\'s Ackermans, in existence since 1996 but just now getting around to delivering a debut LP, have made one hell of a rock n\' roll record. They do a poppier version of the Euro-garage thing (Hives, Manikins, Caesars), with a heavy infusion of mod/R & B and kind of a Brit-pop feel to the vocals. Perhaps that doesn\'t sound revolutionary on paper, but on record it\'s a blast! From wire to wire, this platter is catchier than the clap and more hyper than a nine-year-old on a Red Bull bender. The Alien Snatch press release says it all: \"With the loud guitars, the adrenalized and totally on the spot vocals, and a firecracker backbeat, this pop record will make you bounce your cheap flat walls off!!\" Right on, brother! Listening to any of these songs, I\'m reminded of those TV commercials where they show people listening to their MP3 players and dancing around like crazy and having a good time. \"Come On, Come On\" may be Song of the Year for 2006, and \"One With Us\" may be #2. And I can\'t get over how fucking good the vinyl sounds - so warm and crisp and just freakin\' PERFECT. Records like this one may convert me back into a vinyl purist!
