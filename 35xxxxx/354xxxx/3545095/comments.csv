,jonssonman,2007-09-06T02:47Z,"Please seed, im downloading with an average speed of 10kb/s :/"
,HOODLUMpirate,2007-09-25T03:23Z,"The torrent is not missing episode 18, it is missing episode 10 from season 2. Other then that video and audio are in great quality."
,elanab27,2007-10-16T02:22Z,are there subtitles with this? 
,f1lby,2008-02-08T17:35Z,"This torrent is missing Episode 10 of Season 2

Also missing Episodes 6 thru to 23 of Season 3, so it's not complete.

Series 1 & 2 has NBC watermarks on bottom right of the  AVI's.

But the quality is excellent (both audio & video) and you'll have to do a bit of extra searching to get the other episodes.

,iamwhoib,2009-11-05T23:22Z,WARNING NBC IS WATCHING THIS ONE....got email today
,dalilamahammer,2011-01-02T05:41Z,"Dude this shit sucks! Some of the episodes lag when it comes to the visual. Then season 3 only has 5 episodes in the file. Seriously man, wtf."
