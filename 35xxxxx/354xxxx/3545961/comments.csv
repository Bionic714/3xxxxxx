,Zipfil,2006-10-31T00:09Z,"This is the original, i use it myself.
No serial needed....."
,Zipfil,2006-11-01T12:03Z,"See that someone have a ""burning"" problem.
Maybe you people should go to: My Computer and select whateever ""burner"" u have, then select Properties and see if you have enabled burning in Windows on it.
Sometimes Windows ""reset"" this option by itself.
This OS live it ovn life :)"
