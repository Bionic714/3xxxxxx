This is the ATR for Starsiege 2845.  Repeat, this is the Alpha Tech Release.  This is not a final version of the game and is incomplete, and thus has many bugs.  The game is still very fun, and addictive once you get past the bugs.

The official 2845 website can be found at http://www.clancoregames.com/

Quick Description: This game has giant robots fighting each other, a basic fighter/bomber to fly around in, and infantry units.
