,RAMM00,2008-07-14T02:09Z,good torrent ppl. Just need more like these ones. Oh by the way is this 'complete'? because when i get to the section VTS_03_1.vob it seems to cut off when he(wingnut) is about to share more information? Maybe i am doing something wrong....let me know?  Everything else works fine.
