My 2 cents

,padre_,2006-11-07T18:42Z,"Goddammit! I'm getting crc-errors on every three part. And with two different apps, winrar and powerarchiver. I d'loaded cd2 from the other release (which seems to be identical with this one) just to test it and not so surprisingly it gave exactly same errors.  Any ideas?
Otherwise it's nice to see these here after couple mma-dedicated hubs died off from dc."
,padre_,2006-11-07T20:19Z,"Hmm, strange shit happens. I've never seen rarpackages getting broken while transferred, but that seems to be the case. I downloaded those parts which caused errors once again, replaced the previous ones with them and now it seems to be ok."
