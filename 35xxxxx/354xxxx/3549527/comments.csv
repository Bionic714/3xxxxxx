,gnochimusic,2006-11-28T01:55Z,"While I'm about to work on a song, after about 50 seconds I get an error message saying: Internal error ocurred. ID=16389.  Call Bias Technical Support for a fix.
The only option I have is to click O.K.
When I do the program shuts down and therefore I can't use the program.
Did I do something wrong in the installation?

Thanks."
