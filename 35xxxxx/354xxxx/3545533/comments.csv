,tawa72,2009-11-07T05:53Z,please re-seed!!!!
,komintern,2010-11-09T22:51Z,"Come on people, seed!
I have seeded almost 30GB of this, have seen dozens completing downloads but almost no one seeds it.
Remember that you only downloaded it because someone seeded, and If you downloaded you must share at last twice the size of the file. If you don't share torrents will just die."
