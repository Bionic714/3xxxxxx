,JackSpencer,2007-01-26T06:00Z,"This seems to be the Time Life series of Woodworking Books from around 1992. Very nice set of books if it is. Probably hand scanned. Worth the download if you are into woodworking.

,bertology,2007-07-26T01:48Z,"This was made with a scanner, some of the text are blurry but still readable (and usable), its a set of 25 TIME LIFE books. Just letting you know before you spend 2.02 GBs on it"
,thecompleteguitarist,2008-02-02T13:25Z,"Excellent resource, very readable and you can pick and choose the downloads so you don't waste time on the whole torrent if you don't want all. Great for any one wanting to improve their wood working skills."
