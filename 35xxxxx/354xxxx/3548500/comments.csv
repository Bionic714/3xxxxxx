,Tsaparang,2006-11-02T22:42Z,"Glad to hear that some of you folks out there  appreciate all my hard work.  I've discovered one episode in my collection from the first series broadcast in 1979 - it's probably the last in the series.  I bought the VCR at the end of 1979, so I missed taping most of the first series.  Shame they've never been fully released on DVD.  Too controversial? When I get the time I'll check my other 250 tapes to see if I have any more episodes, but don't get too hopeful!

Anyone interested in the Innes Book of Records (odd ball musical comedy sketches by Neil Innes)?  Let me know and I may decide to post them."

It doesn't happen to have the sketch where they sing about that retired news anchor (because I just love that sketch).
