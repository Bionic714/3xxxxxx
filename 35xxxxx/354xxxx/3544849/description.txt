MythTV 0.20 on Xebian 1.1.4 for Xbox

This is the fourth release of this dist. Let\'s call it 1.4

Installation
============

Unzip mythtv_0.20_xebian_1.1.4_xbox_1.4.zip into E:\\ on your xbox. You can\'t just put it anywhere, it must be unzipped to E:\\. You will probably need to edit your dashboard config file to add this directory to your menu. See your dashboard documentation for details.

You will need to login from another machine using ssh. The IP address is configured to be 192.168.1.6. There are a few logins that are default for this dist:

Login   Pass
==============
root    xebian
live    live

Once you are able to boot into linux, ssh into the box using the live account. Make any changes necessary.

Changes you are likely to make include:
=======================================
Changing the IP Address by editing /etc/network/interfaces.
Editing /etc/hosts to change the mythtv entry to point to your backend.
Editing /etc/fstab to nfs mount the media directory from your backend.

Notes
========
Currently MythTV is configured to point to a backend with the hostname \'mythtv\' as defined in /etc/hosts. It currently points to 192.168.1.8.

This installation is also configured to nfs mount mythtv:/mythtv on /mythtv.

You will also need to add permissions to your backend database so that this installation can access the database. I will not document that here. See www.mythtv.org for details.
