,uggenabben,2006-10-30T20:05Z,I am quite sure most of the retards around here are unaware about the fact that the information is available by clicking the number of files (at the top of this page). Try it!!!

I can't believe there are people who seriously 
appreciate a torrent like this. Sure it's nice that people wanna share and all but sometimes it would just be better if they didn't.

Why would someone want 3 different versions of Paintshop Pro? Why would someone wanna download DX9c along with the other programs in this torrent? Why would someone want both Dreamweaver MX2004 and the Dreamweaver 8 that is included in the Stuido8 suite? Why would someone even want Dreamweaver in a ""Graphic applications"" torrent? and so on..."
,uraphake,2006-10-31T13:35Z,"1. It's not 3 different versions of Paintshop Pro.
2. Do you even know what DirectX is for?
3. Do you even know what the Dreamweaver apps are all about?

Obviously, you're not able to connect the dots. But just because you can't doesn't mean that other people are just like you."
,uraphake,2006-10-31T13:57Z,"Also, would you question the inclusion of Quicktime as well (even though it's not included)? Some features in Studio 8 require Quicktime just as some apps require a minumum version of the DirectX APIs in order to function properly. Believe it, or not, there is a reason for some of what is included in this torrent."
