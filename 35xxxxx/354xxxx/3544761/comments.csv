BTW I use Azureus. PeppieHimself.
P.S. if it doesn't work (that is it says that files ar missing), read the Serials & crack.txt included in the zip file. It's just a matter of copying sims2.exe to your program directory."

When installing the first disk you will have to input one of the serial numbers thats provided in the zip file. Fully install the game, then quit. Next copy the Sim2.exe crack from the extracted zip file to your Sims 2 TSBin folder overwriting the old one. Now play the game stupid asshole. "

,Ad-rock,2006-12-23T22:40Z,"It works perfectly fine. Great game btw! Thanks Peppie. For people who can't figure it out, all you do is mount the image with Daemon or Alcohol. It's extremely simple. The easiest way is probably to mount all four images on seperate drives at the same time, that way it does all the work by itself. Not only that but Daemon only allows you to mount four images at a time anyway. "
,Ad-rock,2006-12-23T22:43Z,"""Aarspace"" you don't have to extract any files. The format the cd info comes in is already .ISO format. You just have to mount the .ISO's :-) "
,Ad-rock,2006-12-23T22:54Z,"Hey guys, I just realized, I didn't use the cracked .exe at all and my copy is still working perfectly fine. It's not asking me for Disc 1 or anything like that. What I did was mount all 4 cd's at the same time then install.(Example: Disc 1 on Drive E, Disc 2 on Drive G and so on) I just left it like that and even after I restarted it still allows me to play with no problems. And I don't seem to be having any problems with building either. Somebody give it a shot and let me know how it turns out."

To start, I then opened 'sims2.exe' from the tsbin folder, was asked to insert disc 1, I did and it worked fine. Hope this helps."

ANSWER TO BUILDING MODE NOT WORKING!

For those of you who cannot get the build mode working then use this fixed Cd exe. This is the brand new one, and def works! 

http://www.gameburnworld.com/dl/dl.php?file=Sims2v1.0FixedexeDVDEng.rar"
,Caliguiri100,2008-01-11T03:33Z,for people using vista or wanting an easier way to open do this go to maxis website and update your sims 2 then go to DAEMON tools and open up your disk one and u want to go and explore the files in it and use auto run it should work
,Caliguiri100,2008-01-11T03:34Z,srry for double post also but it works fine and u can use build mode lmao
,texasgirl8307,2008-01-17T00:10Z,I have windows xp and when I looked up the sims 2 game on wikipedia it said you have to have a compatible video card or something like that.  Do you really have to have the right one in your computer?
,Butler222,2008-01-22T17:52Z,I need help. I cant figure out how to 'insert' the CDs. Where is the file? Help...
,Galondel,2008-01-23T12:59Z,"Has anyone else had trouble trying to build a house from the ground up? It's like every build function in the F3 menu is frozen, cannot create walls, windows, doors, swimming pools, nothing..... Something wrong with the torrent, or a glitch my end?"
,Galondel,2008-01-23T13:01Z,"I apologise most profusely for not reading the above comment, thankyou very much leprachaun91 for solving the problem."
,Galondel,2008-01-23T13:03Z,"Oh bloody hell, that new patch of leprachauns' just bought back the original problem, now the sodding game wants a DVD again!"
,Galondel,2008-01-23T13:14Z,"Right, i have come to the conclusion that this game WILL NOT play properly. There is a choice of 2 gamefixes:
The first (just over 13mb, comes with torrent) bypasses the need for a dvd, but doesnt allow you to build.
The second fix (15mb) that leprachaun states above probably does fix the build menu, however it doesnt fix the dvd problem the first fix sorts out, so the game simply will not load without an official disk.
My suggestion is either play the game without using the build menu (which sucks) or don't play the game at all (which really sucks). Peace out"
,sarsaa,2008-01-23T15:15Z,"Ok, lets clear this one out!

First, you need daemon tools. Mount the first cd. (the .rar file) Do not extract the files before mounting.
When it asks for the serial number, you get that from the ""serials, cheats and crack"" one. (this one, you should extract to get the files.
When it asks for cd2, just mount the second file. (again, without extracting the files)
Once you've gone through all the cds, mount cd1 again.

DON'T use the crack, just play the game with cd1 mounted.

If the game doesnt play, it still says ""insert cd1"", do the following:
With cd 1 mounted go to ""my computer"" and then drive F (or wichever drive you have the sims mounted at).
The open the ""AutoRun"" file, the game will run perfectly from here, and the building mode works.
Altrnatively, you can make a shortcut of the AutoRun file and place on the desktop and open the game from there. (you still need to mount cd1)

Good luck and hope this helps you all.

Thanks for an excellent torrent!"

,liewyuqiang,2008-04-15T16:43Z,"Lol you all must know how to use these things...
Daemon tools - Mount? what is Mount? Mount is to fix or what ever you call it to download it.(not very clear)It should be a Iso. file or any other file which does not have an image or asks for what program to use it.


Daemon tools usage -
1.Download it - Google it
2.Restart Com
3.You should see a green or red lightning bolt on your right bottom -where all you icons are.
4.Right click it and go emulation and click on Safedisc
5.After you download the file you want Vi....Cd Dvd-rom and set how many devices you need - Lets say you have 2 files then add two devices. 4files add four devices.
6.Click on any device and mount the file you want! 

Simple! Tell me if my explanation is not good. [1 to 10]


co2

6.Click"
,liewyuqiang,2008-04-15T16:44Z,The is no 6.Click
,Atlas305,2008-04-16T01:45Z,"Hmmm... *****OR*****
-Download and Install "" MagicISO "" (free program, trial version is acceptable and unlimited time, no need to restart)
-and right click the ""image file""  (a C.D looking thing in the torrent)
-Scroll to MagicISO then 'Mount to drive' (any drive is acceptable)
-BAM!! GAme is installing!
__ now to  get the Crack just double click the ""image file' and find the CracK folder and right click and Extract__

MagicISo is a software that acts as Hardware.. it creates (vitrual) Drives on your PC. Sound complicated? Well if it does its really not.. follow these instructions for any game torrent and you can have the 80GB+ of games for free like me :P "

,Daniel72,2008-05-07T19:15Z,"Hey. How does this work: During the installation of the game use one of the serial numbers listed here:
THA2-Z3FK-OR1A-3HZ4-2WUS
374U-U5GT-1RZ9-4PDG-T5QZ
DKSS-YCA2-ZO11-SSP7-3AFH
XUT3-6LHW-ZOR1-JH7N-VV7I
DWJ2-Q92Z-R1R1-5F6R-077P

When starting the game, it asks for the first disc.
You do not have the original discs, so you do not have this one either.
To play the game, you have to:
- stop the game first
- copy the original program file sims2.exe (which usually resides in 
  ""C:\Program Files\EA Games\Sims 2\TSBin\"" or whatever comes close)
  with the one enclosed here.
- Start the game

,Destroy850,2008-05-15T23:37Z,"READ IF LOST;

before you can install.
get daemon tools.
download and install daemons tools lite(freeware) from their website, or get pro off pirate bay.

FIRST STEP.
open daemons tools and mount (PC GAME) The Sims 2 CD1

as your doing that first part of installation, unzip Serials, cheats & crack.ZIP

when the installation asks for serial, use one provided in the text doc.

when it asks for disc two, right click on daemon tools go and mount image and mount disc 2.

then just do the same thing for the other two discs.
very easy. 
if you need more help just ask the question and someone will reply.

If anyone knows a working crack with save mode and build mode would really appreciate if they wrote it up here please
bye"
,sean_360,2008-06-22T00:16Z,"Sorry about the post before, i figured it out using the crack and now everything works including build mode plus it saves properly.
This is how i did it;
Used""That Zero Guy's"" link (find his comment page 15) and downloaded the cracked file. Then replaced the original crack provided in this torrent with the new one.
Finally using Daemon tools pro i made sure the Sims 2 disc 1 on this torrent was on the virtual drive i have by double clicking the sims 2 disc 1 image so that it is now on the virtual drive  (was on my computer and sims 2 as though it was in the virtual drive)
Then it worked fine and didnt ask me for the disc.
I think you have to make sure that the sims 2 disc one image is always in the virtual drive when you load the sims because that is the only way it recognises it unless you have burnt it on to a real disc.
Good luck all and im only trying to help, so if its goes wrong to other people dont come to me.
Bye

Good luck"

you don't have to unpack the files they are iso's, all you need is a cd mounting tool like ""daemon tools lite"".

2- Download.
3- Install.
4- Left-Click on the daemon icon in the taskbar.
5- Click ""Device 0:... Empty""
6- Browse for the sims cd images (iso) that you downloaded.
7- After you finish the 1st cd, mount and do the same for each one of them untill you finish them all and continue installation untill it is finished.
8- Replace no-cd crack with the one in program files directory/ea games/sims 2 or whatever (game directory)"

Installing it isnt a problem though.  Half the newbs here didnt read the install instructions included in the fucking download, so dont believe its too hard."

1. Download torrent
2. After downloading unzip serial, cheats put into a another folder
3. Go to Daemon tools(selection emulations, then all options on.) Then select virtual dvd, peg over to J:(or whatever its drive is called) peg over again and select mount image.
4. The game should start the installation process, when it says insert cd 2, go back to step 1 and instead select the 2nd iso image to mount. 
5. Repeat for cd 3, 4
6. When it's done installing, don't start the game, exit out/quit instead. Then find the folder where you have the crack, copy it.
7.Find the TSBin folder (it should be in the EA/Sims 2 folder that is in your c:/program files.
8. Paste crack into folder, option comes up saying do you want to replace say yes.
9. Your done, play the game."

I am running Vista and to get the game to play, there are a couple of things I had to do to get this to work.
1. once downloaded, I unzipped using WinRAR and placed each ""Disk"" into it's own folder on the hard drive.
2. I burned a data disk for each one using Power2GO (you can use similar software). This was to make it easier for me and so I would have a backup. Some people have used mounting software for ISOs, but I have not tried that method. You should be able to skip this step if you can use that software effectively.
3. I installed Sims 2 using crack key # in text file in crack folder.
4. once installed, copy Sims2.exe file from crack folder into the specified location (see serials & cracks text file). I changed the name of the original so it wouldnt delete it, just incase I needed to come back to it.
5. once copied into new folder, right click and run as administrator.
6. game plays and you are done

When the game starts to run, if you get a DirectX 9.0c error, download update from microsoft.com. After that it works like a dream so far. I hope this helps."

i just read through all the 27 pages of muck so listen if u want to get this working.

secondly, make sure that the icon at the bottom of uttorent is green or ur download speed will be greatly reduced. wen i got mine fixed i went from 20kbs to 130kbs in about 10 secs. google it.

next thing to say, if u have noticed most vista users have problems with this so if u got vista, its a bit of a gamble to dl.

Install pirate games never guarantees to work as all systems are different so who noes if it will work for you. just hope it will.

also i will seed for a very long time i love the sims :)

If u get the build mode error where u cant build stuff, read page 15.

if u dont noe how to install this, u shouldn't be here. ask someone online in a forum on how to install don't spam please.

dont spam with ""SEEDD PLZ!!!!"" it gets annoying, people will seed and wen seeders read comments like that it discourages them so they stop seeding.

most problems have been answered in the last 27 pages so read over it quickly and u will  find ur answer thanks for reading"

5. the crack i told you to download needs to be pasted into the EA games folder AFTER you install the game etc.

to install, simply go to computer and click on the cd that you have mounted via a program (poweriso, daemon, etc). it should start installing. 



after you ""replace"" the file in your tsbin folder, make the replacement file a shortcut on your desktop.

Right-click the program's icon in the bottom-right corner of your toolbar; it won't appear in the taskbar. Choose ""Virtual CD/DVD-Rom"" and click ""Set number of Drives"". Set it to four. Now left-click (for those who can't figure it out, that's just a regular mouse click) on the Daemon Tools icon again. Load the corresponding disks into the corresponding drives (i.e., disk one into drive one etc etc, ignore the letters for now). When the Sims 2 installer asks for the next disk, direct it to the drive where you've already loaded the next disks. Unless you're doing something wrong, or there's something wrong with the download itself, this will work flawlessly."

Problems/Questions:
1. Slow Speed (Download /Speed/Kbps)
2. Building a Wall
3. Installation Problem
4. Not responding after you quit the game

Answers:
1. your Bittorrent should be Port Forwarded... go to http://www.portforward.com for more Info, and experience a 400 Kbps speed!

2. you should follow my instruction on my Comment on page 28 (just find the name Leon47)

3. Actually, there's no problem in installing this Game... maybe it's just you... just insert the disks using Daemon Tool... you can Insert it one by one, or set the Daemon Tool Drivers into 4 Drives, just right click on it then choose set drivers, then select 4 drivers, and that's it! you can now insert all the disk from your Downloaded File, or you can insert it 1 by 1 as I said earlier...

4.Do not remove, I repeat DO NOT remove the Disk 1 after you Installed the game or played the game...

Now, after installing, set-up will ask you what you want to do. Choose to start the game. It will ask you to insert CD1. Do so with DAEMON Tools. As before, the 'compatability problem' notice will appear. Now, if you click run program anyway, it should work (at least it did for me). Afterwards, just keep on playing the game by loading the CD1 with DAEMON tools and use start game icons on your desktop/start menu. Good luck, hope this is the solution for all of you!"

if someone experiencing this following Problems:

Problems/Questions:
1. Slow Speed (Download /Speed/Kbps)
2. Building a Wall
3. Installation Problem
4. Not responding after you quit the game

Answers:
1. your Bittorrent should be Port Forwarded... go to http://www.portforward.com for more Info, and experience a 400 Kbps speed!

2. you should follow my instruction on my Comment on page 28 (just find the name Leon47)

3. Actually, there's no problem in installing this Game... maybe it's just you... just insert the disks using Daemon Tool... you can Insert it one by one, or set the Daemon Tool Drivers into 4 Drives, just right click on it then choose set drivers, then select 4 drivers, and that's it! you can now insert all the disk from your Downloaded File, or you can insert it 1 by 1 as I said earlier...

4.Do not remove, I repeat DO NOT remove the Disk 1 after you Installed the game or played the game...


IMPORTANT:
1. this is a good Torrent by PeppieHimself so please, keep this Torrent alive! SEED after you download it... have a happy Sims life!


TRIVIA:
you can make your own character using MODs...
for example, using Rinoa as your Spouse...
or even Jill Valentine from Resident Evil 3 as your Sister...

Step 1: Download torrent 

Step 2: Open the folder you saced the torrent to and extract the Serials, Cheats and Crack folder

Step 3: Run Daemon tools

Step 4: Right click on daemon tools in your task bar and go to virtual cd/dvd rom, device 0, mount image

Step 5: mount PC GAME THE SIMS2 CD1, this should open an auto play folder, select run setup,exe, or select install game ( i cant remember which 1 it said)

Step 6:select where you want the game to install and insert one of the serials, found in the Serials and crack txt document


Step 7: instal the game, at about 25%,50% and 75% of the way during the installation, it will ask you to insert the next disk, all you do is right click on daemon tools again and mount the disks in order, 2, 3 then 4 

step 7:go to the folder where you extracted serials, Cheats and Crack and copy the file Sims 2

Step 8:Paste it into the folder you installed sims 2 to

Step 9:Any time you want to play, launch the sims2 crack

Step 11: Have a cookie:)"

,SDkitty,2009-08-01T21:55Z,"For those of you confused about the inserting disc 2, I'm assuming you're unfamiliar with using a virtual drive.  I recommend using Daemon Tools Lite but there are others available.  You use the drive just like a normal cd/dvd drive, when the computer asks you to insert 2nd (and so on) disc you simply unmount the disc 1 image and mount the next one.  I hope that helps :)"
,SDkitty,2009-08-01T22:02Z,"oh and @ Nikosgr1, it actually is possible to mount more than one image at a time, you just have to go into the preferences and set up more virtual drives.  For this specific game I would not recommend that though since it loads them in a specific order."

,Lagius,2009-08-03T01:01Z,"Okay, so now I've read all the comments for this torrent but I'm still having the building problem. The game worked perfectly when I first played it, probably because I launched the game with daemon and the cd1.iso file. But then, I got tired of the isos (I have 20GB disc space in my ancient computer), deleted them and tried the crack file. Then came the problem with building. I tested every one of the links to a new crack file posted here but all of them required the CD1 mounted to launch the game. So, is there a crack file anywhere that doesn't need the game disc mounted to launch?"
,Lagius,2009-08-03T15:46Z,I got it finally working! The crack issued by grimvh2 works fine. http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4629868/Mini-Image__amp__Crack_for_The_Sims_2_(build_mode_working

Follow the instructions and if your computer is Windows Vista you have to run the Sims2.exe as an adminstrator. (Right click and Run as Administrator). It would probably ask for a cd, so try using CD 2, the one you have mounted.

I tried to emulate (mount) the .iso images using Daemon Tools but it didn't seem to work in Vista nor did Alcohol 120%. So I burned the .iso images using Nero 7 (Demo) and it worked just fine, (though there are four cds lying around, kinda annoying).

How to mount:

1. DO NOT extract the files from their folders once downloaded.
2. Open (PC GAMES) The Sims 2 CD 1
3. Select ""setup""
4. It will ask you for your language, pick one, it will then ask you for a serial code. The serial code is in the ""Serials, cheats & crack.ZIP"" folder, just copy a serial from the text document.
5. It will begin downloading, and stop at 22%, and ask you to insert Disk 2.
6. (NOTE: IM USING DAEMON TOOLS LITE)
7. Open Daemon tools, and press the ""Add File"" button (It looks like a cd with a + sign)
8. Locate the compressed file you downloaded ""(PC GAME) The Sims 2 CD 2"" (Or whatever Cd is required next for you in the installation)
9. Select it.
10. Under Image Catalog, select the folder you just selected, and press the ""Mount"" button (It looks like a cd with a sideways arrow on it)
11. Repeat step 8 with the next file need for the download
12. If you still have any problems, i will be checking the comments for a while and help with any concerns."

How to unlock building mode:

For people who want to get the building mode working :

Instal this patch :

it did the first time, with some problems but you could play it. then i updated my computer and now it doesnt work anymore and asks me to insert cd even when i already have. 

compatibility options do not work either and updating the sims 2 will make your game not work. just dont download if you're using vista."

For all you people saying it doesn't work on Windows Vista... it does! Because it works on mine and I'm using Vista.

This is what I did...
When I mounted all the CD's and finished the installation, I replaced the sims2.exe file like they said with the file from the original. THIS DOESN'T WORK. The crack for some reason isn't working. So download another crack and replace it with that one! And finally it works!

,virmillion,2011-03-07T04:11Z,"Ok, everyone who is talking shit needs to stop!!!
This torrent is perfectly fine and working, if you cant get it, f*ckin learn something before your complain.

THIS IS HOW I GOT IT TO WORK.
Download torrent, I use BitTorrent. And Daemon Lite. Then once the torrent is finished you need to open Daemon.
Once open start 3 more drives. Once they are open, before you do anything with the files or try to install, put ALL FOUR FILES ON A DRIVE. BEFORE YOU START INSTALL. Then all you need to do is enter a activation code(They work, I used the 3rd one) and install. I didn't NOT have to even use the crack, and everything works PERFECTLY. It is not hard people, and quit talking shit to someone who is just trying to help out by giving this to you. Really."

,AlphaDog9910,2011-10-10T23:03Z,"This torrent works very well. I am running Windows XP with Service Pack 3. Haven't tried it on my Vista or 7 computers, so I can't say for sure if this will work on those Operating Systems. All I did was mount the .iso files in PowerISO and began installation. You have to do it disc by disc. Do not mount all at the same time. The installation will prompt you to 'insert' (mount) the next disc at which point you will unmount the current disc and remount with the next disc. At the beginning of the installation, it asks you for the serial. Make sure to use the 4th one. That one seems to work the best. 

There have also been issues with build mode not working. Build mode will not work if you apply the no-CD crack. Don't copy the Sims2 .exe provided in the torrent to the game directory. The game will work, but build mode won't work. To overcome this, simply mount disc 1 in DAEMON TOOLS! For some reason it will not work in PowerISO. Build mode will work. You just have to mount disc 1 every time you want to play. It sucks, but it's not that big of a deal. Hope this helps everyone having issues."

,A7X050393,2012-05-29T15:44Z,"OK
SO for all the people who are bitching about it being a shitty torrent, it works fine as long as you follow instructions!!

(1)
You need to download winrar and Daemon Tools to run pretty much any games you get off pirate bay...

(2)
Run (mount) each of the disks (in order) in daemon tools, and in the first disk use the serial code provided in the word doc in the download (you need winrar to unpack the file)

(3)
When all 4 cd's have been installed, go back to the winrar unpacked folder, and copy the crack into the directory, which is 
""C:Program FilesEA GamesSims 2TSBin
or something similar.
It will prob be Program Files (x86) if your on windows 7.

(4) Once you have copied and replaced the crack into that directory, go to
http://cdn.naxpgaming.com/gbw/dl.php?file=Sims2v1.0FixedexeDVDEng.rar
and download the file there, then copy the crack in the folder (it may require winrar at first) into the same directory which you did for the first crack, again replacing it

(5) 
Now mount disk 1 in Daemon tools and run the sims2.exe crack that you just copied. If you get an error 'unspecificied error' and the game won't run, trying right-clicking and clicking 'run as administrator', as this tends to make most games run properly on Windows 7.

(6)
with the crack installed, disk mounted and running as admin, there should be no problems with the game!

SUMMARY
- Download Daemon tools and Winrar
- Mount each disk in order to install
- Download crack from aforementioned website
- Install crack in program files
- Mount disk 1
- Run as admin
- Enjoy one of the greatest games ever made!

Any issues feel free to pm me...

Great upload Peppie!"
