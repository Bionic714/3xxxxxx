,BGFeltenink,2006-10-19T20:47Z,"Alright this worked on the ""Gothic 3 English NRG IMAGE"" however.... everything is in German!

I can only vaugely understand it, is there a way to switch languages back to English?  I couldn't find a setting in the game but I might have overlooked something."
,PolishEagle,2006-10-19T20:51Z,You have to look at the .ini file in your docs/gothic3 dir. Change the two rows about language to English.
,GarettJaxx,2006-10-19T20:56Z,At last ! I too can confirm that this works with my v1.1 updated German version (patched to English)
