On another note - 
Is anyone else getting a freezing issue?
My halts everytime I go near the third cupboard from the left in Lucas's Kitchen 

There's two bonus cards in there (one at one point one at another) There's a Scene in the Apartment where everything starts coming apart (sorry to spoil) It even freezes there 

Is anyone else having a similar issue?

lol I know it's weird to associate it to that specific aspect of the game but it's only when any form of interaction with that cupboard does the game halt.

Anyway - Much obliged - Running Vista MSI version"

,binhbinh,2008-08-15T06:59Z,"here's to people who's installer was 'interuppted'. i'm not sure this is the best way to install it, but hey it worked for me.

this is assuming you have winrar btw.

1. download
2. make a file on the desktop
3. extract 'rld-fahr.r00' on the new file
4. download the new .msi from here: http://www.zerowaitingtime.com/21759-download-Fahrenheit_Installer.7z
5. replace that .msi with the original one in the new folder
6. double click on setup in the new folder
7. after installing, get the crack from a folder inside the new folder and replace it with the original one where you downloaded it

i'm not sure if that will work 100% so if you still have the interruption problem, try selecting all the files in the new folder->right click->'add to 'file name.rar'->rename the .rar part to .iso. it'll probably take a long time but after that just mount and retry with the setup in your new winrar archive.

also, if you installed it correctly but have 'insert DVD' popping up, you forgot to up the crack in the place you downloaded."

,pikkie001,2008-10-12T12:41Z,"THE solution for VISTA x64 users.
I installed it on my XP partition & just run it form my VISTA x64 partition. Its THAT simple, folks.
This also works with other apps (with me 4 so far), just try...
Install & leave them be on the XP-partition and run them from your Vista, with all the benefits from the x64 architecture."
,BatmanJones,2008-10-20T17:53Z,"This method takes a little while to do, but it works.
For the record I'm running Vista. I haven't tried this on my XP computer but I am familiar with XP and this method should work.
You will need a copy of Daemon Tools lite to play this game or something similar here is a link to Daemons website
http://www.daemon-tools.cc/dtcc/download.php
I'm unique in the galaxy, and kind to nubes. Hence my directions are explicit. To those who don't need the lengthy explanations, my apologies for the opulence of my words.

1. Create a folder on desktop entitled Fahrenheit-RE
2. in the Fahrenheit Folder in your downloads folder there are many rar or zipped folders, right click on one and choose extract files... and extract them to the Fahrenheit-RE folder on your desktop.
3. There is now a rar or zipped folder in the Fahrenheit-RE folder it is called rld-fhr, right click on it and choose extract here
4. open the folder called 'crack' copy this folder and paste it on the desktop now open it and see the .exe file called Fahrenheit right click and copy this file
5. Open the folders programs/Atari/Fahrenheit right click on an empty space in this folder and select paste, agree to replace the old .exe file with the new one
6. Close all windows
7. Open the Fahrenheit-RE folder on your desktop
8. If the rar or zipped folder called rld-fhr remains delete it
9. Select all the contents of this folder right click, choose the option Add to Archive... name the new file rld-fhr.iso
10 delete everything in the Fahrenheit-RE folder except for the new rld-fhr file
11. start daemon tools, go to the red lighting bolt in your notification area (icon near your clock), right click select virtual CD/DVD ROM then Device then mount image select Fahrenheit-RE then rld-fhr if this file doesn't show up go to the drop down that says files of type and set it to 'Standard ISO Images'
12. Go to my computer open the daemon disc drive click on setup
13. after installation is complete, right click on the new Fahrenheit shortcut on the desktop select properties then click on the find target button paste a copy of the fahrenheit.exe from the 'crack' folder into the hard drive(C:)/Program Files/Atari/Fahrenheit folder, when the prompt asks you if you want to replace the old file with the new one say yes
14. Open the 'crack' folder and click on the update installer

As long as the rld-fhr file in your Fahrenheit-RE folder remains the mounted image on your daemon disc drive you should be able to play this game now with no problems. Enjoy the game"

,God4u,2010-02-24T18:16Z,"Ok, heres the deal! I wanned to play this game really really badly! But unfortunately i got this totally messed up Vista OS. And i got all the problems u can find posted here, and even more. Cuz even when i did edit .msi files, and got all the cracks, and did extract, and made new .iso files and everything. I even got the game starting to install, but it rolled back in the end of installation becouse os some kind of 1729 error or smthn like that. But i still didnt gave up. And what do u know, i found a solution... I simply downloaded Virtual Box, its a freeware u can go and download it on their home page, so...
1.Download Virtual Box
2.Download XP OS!
3. Install Virtual Box
4. Following quite easy manuals, create a new machine, like a new virtual pc.
4a. The VB will ask for the image file(.iso) with needed OS in it. Its easy, ull browse it and mmount it. VB got hes own mounting devices. So u wont need DT.
5. When everything is set, ull have windows popping up and in there ull see ur new virtual PC starting up, and like every pc, ull have to install on ur OS, thats also pretty easy, u can find some walkthroughs and faq's via internet search engines.
6. So when that all is done, just mount your FAhrenheit-rld.iso file, and there u go, ull install it on your new win xp! 

This might ask a bit more pc resources, but hey, its Farhenheit, and it doesnt ask too much resources. 
So thats how i got this game working for my crappy Vista, hope this one helps! HF&GL! "
