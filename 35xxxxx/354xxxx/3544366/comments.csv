,deaconite,2006-12-07T10:07Z,Thank you. Great Quality!
,jrnfl182,2007-04-22T15:44Z,How do you open a .FLAC file. What can i use to watch it?
,TheEaglesFan,2007-10-30T21:55Z,"The are most lightly that there are to folders; AUDIO_TS and VIDEO_TS. 
Open the VIDEO_TS folder and look for the one file named video_ts. When you find it, right click on it and choose ""Play In..."" or something like that, I'm a Norwegian guy, so I suck in English, and play this file in whatever you always use to watch movies.

Hope that this helped! And I'm sorry for any spelling mistakes. :)"
