Most people know Dr. Seuss as the man behind The Cat in the Hat. But 
how many know that Yertle the Turtle was modeled on the rise of 
Hitler, or that Seuss created WWII political cartoons that 
tackled racism, anti-isolationism and other issues of the day?

THE POLITICAL DR. SEUSS reveals how popular children's author Theodor 
Geisel advocated social change, teaching generations of children not 
only how to be better readers, but better people as well.
