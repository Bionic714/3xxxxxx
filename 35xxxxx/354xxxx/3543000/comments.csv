,blanka2g,2007-12-12T13:16Z,I need an activation code to play the iwin family feud how do I find one sorry this is my first download and there is alot more to this than just a point and click like I thought 
,darklingmiss,2007-12-22T06:51Z,"The download comes with a crack .exe file. Once you run the setup file, copy the .exe file from the crack folder. Then paste it into the folder where the game installed. It will ask you if you want to replace the older .exe with the new one. Tell it yes. That should take care of it!"
