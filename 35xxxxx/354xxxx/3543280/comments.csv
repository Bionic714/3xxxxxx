WTF..."
,Falleen_Fan_No_1,2008-03-16T06:09Z,"This title annoys you????  This is an AMAZING record.  How in any way, shape, or form could it annoy you?  The Violin mixed with the lulling voice, it gives me chills.  Just download the track ""Many Lives -> 49 MP"" if you're still skeptical.  Thanks so much thezulu for uploading this.  His stuff is so hard to find, I really appreciate it.  I say a lot on torrents ""i recommend this"", but i REALLY recommend this CD.  It's very different from mainstream music, but in the best way possible."
