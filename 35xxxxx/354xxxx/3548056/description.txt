Scare Tactics is the scariest hidden-camera show on television.

The new season of Scare Tactics throws a whole new batch of unsuspecting victims into even bigger and freakier situations than ever before. We\'ve taken it up a notch, and we\'re not apologizing!

We twist the realities of unwitting people who have been set up by their friends and family members for the scare of a lifetime. Every situation is shot as if it\'s a movie ? except that the starring \"victims\" are real people with real emotions and absolutely no clue that they are about to be taken on heart-pounding thrill-rides that will leave them creeped out, gasping and screaming.

The best part? The entire experience is being captured on videotape!

Scare Tactics is hosted by Stephen Baldwin and produced by Hallock Healey Entertainment.
