S.N.A. Lyrics:

Alright, now here we go / step back if you┬┤re moving slow
Dressed up, looking good / the coolest cats in the neighbourhood

Everybody┬┤s feeling nice, baby, saturday night arrite!

No drugs, no dealer to pay / we┬┤ll get some anyway
We┬┤re gonna feel the heat / tonight when we hit the street

Everybody┬┤s feeling nice, baby, saturday night arrite!

We┬┤re going downtown, we┬┤re going out
We┬┤re going downtown, tonight

Oh, we are going to the (1) R.o.k. / Oh oh where on our way
G ood times and happy days / Ah yes! allright! oh yey!

Everybody┬┤s feeling nice, baby, saturday night arrite!

Go on, get it on!

This is our own netrelease. If you find any of these songs in another release from another group, then they have taken the mp3's from our release. These songs are not available on cd or any other media, this is encoded directly from project mixdown masters. I'm releasing it like this for those who are like me and hate crappy releases, separate songs and messy mp3-folders. And for those who have filthy computers, just put the files in your chaotic mp3-directory, but please, at least don't rename them. Renamers should be strangled!
