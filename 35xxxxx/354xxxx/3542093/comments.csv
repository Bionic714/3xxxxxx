[T],Ythan,2006-10-19T10:40Z,Trial with license
,Jacke89,2006-10-19T19:13Z,"Någon som fått detta att funka? För mig säger den att jag måste aktivera, alltså registrera det på internet och att det bara är en 30 dagars trail. Varför?

Has anyone got this to work? It tells me that i have to register it on the internet and that i only have 30 days left on my trail. Why?"
,Meyithi,2006-10-20T06:09Z,"You have to copy the licence AND the .exe of the trial version requested into the installation directory.  Easiest way is to install the version you need, start app, close app.  Copy over licence AND .exe you installed.  Next time you start the app is should be registered."
,Jacke89,2006-10-20T08:20Z,I did all that but still wants me to activate it. Don't understand why.
,ludakris,2006-10-20T17:54Z,It worked for me. This is what I did...1.Create a diretory c:\Programs Files\Diskeeper Corporation\Diskeeper and copy the license.dal file into that directory.  Now proceed to install whichever version you want in the same directory as above.  You have to have the dal file in the directory before you install the program.
,EddieZ,2006-10-27T13:10Z,I guess the license only is meant for one of the included versions. I installed server but no luck...:-(
,jokio,2006-10-30T20:32Z,Do anyone of you have the working licence for this?
,jokio,2006-10-31T19:41Z,Do you have another link? I don't understand nothing of that page...
,jokio,2006-10-31T22:25Z,This version works after all. I tested to change my date to 31.12.2006 and the program was still working just fine. It sayed that I had over 1.7 millions days left... Now I have a peace of mind with this activation - days left - notice ;) 
,ALIEN68,2006-11-02T02:27Z,It doesn't work. I have tried maybe 15 times. Hope someone soon will post working one
,goodtoshare,2006-11-03T07:03Z,Same here. Tried to reinstall/register the server edition countless times. Still a 30 day demo...
,craigl281,2006-11-04T23:33Z,"ok this works
i installed pro premier
opened it, closed it, then copied over the license files]
then in the folder of those mentioned license files i double clicked setup and repaired installation, works perfect for me"
,Malvient,2006-11-07T07:25Z,This works fine if you follow the instructions in the readme properly.
,Matri,2006-11-07T23:40Z,have you actually tried activating it yet?
,dark_requiem,2006-11-09T07:03Z,"This only works for the Pro Premier version.  I tried the Enterprise Server version, and it won't work.  Follow the instructions as per the readme, but only use the Pro Premier version.  Besides, unless you're doing remote administration of Diskeeper or you have a terabyte or more of disk space to defrag, Pro Premier is all you really need."
,Wav3 CrackeR,2006-11-14T16:18Z,This is a good program it removed my paping file so i dont take so long to start my computer as it did before and its much faster!
,z_Melkor_z,2006-11-20T11:49Z,"I used license file fromthe beginning, but now I am suggested to activate it. So, this release will work for a month without saying anything about that."
,pattymayo321,2006-11-26T10:17Z,when i updated from diskeeper 10 to diskeeper 11 pro premier... it never asked for a serial so perhaps updating from older version will work
,pattymayo321,2006-11-26T10:19Z,"http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3418507/Executive.Diskeeper.Professional.Premier.Edition.v10.0.593.Retai

this is the version i installed before diskeeper 2007"
,Wav3 CrackeR,2006-11-29T17:43Z,This torrent sucks its not cracked!! it stops after 30 days!!!! :(:(:(:(:(:(:(:(:(
,Wav3 CrackeR,2006-12-11T18:25Z,Please Can Some one Make A Crack Or A Working Serial!???1111
,azidtrip,2007-09-24T22:27Z,"Listen to me ya bunch of helpless noobs :P. I remember an earlier version of diskeeper that I had same problem with activating it. What u need to do is to kill diskeeper process so it isnt running, THEN copy the files to install dir. I have not tested, but this worked for me in past version. 

Thanks..."
