,tomtomx,2006-10-18T19:08Z,"Former KuKluxKlan leader and right wing white supremacist David Duke got his honorary doctorate from a university in Ukraine known as the main source of anti-Semitic activity and publishing in Ukraine. He sure as hell didn't get any doctor title based on any knowledge! His writings are filled with misinterpretations, lies, fantasies, fabrications and forgeries. Which of course made him a hero in Ukraine and the arab world... It's a wonder the US ever let him out of jail again (where he spent time for mail fraud)..."

My Dear Friends,

I want to take a moment to thank all the people who have posted congratulations to me and have sent me, it seems, a hard disk full of emails of good wishes.

Thank You All!!!

I do want to say that in some ways I feel I undeserving, I was lucky to work with a great university and brave individuals who dared to raise the ire of the Jewish extremists. At this moment I think of my friend Germar Rudolf who was unjustly denied his doctorate in Germany because of this truth telling. I consider him even more deserving of the title of Doctor along with that great revisionist and incredible scholar Juergen Graf. And I can think of a number of writers, researchers, and philosophers of our Cause that deserve the title as much or more than I do for their intellectual work on behalf of our people.

Furthermore, there are so many without higher degrees that have done brilliant work for our Cause and they continue to deserve our respect and utmost support. One needs not a higher degree to tell the truth!

I would lie if I told you that achieving this PhD from a major university system has not been a source of great satisfaction, especially because the intellectual establishment loves to belittle my writing and speaking. So, yes, it feels great!

But the most important thing about the PhD in history for me is that in the minds of many readers it will add just a little bit of authority and power to everything I write. It will open up new doors of thought for many people. Furthermore it makes those attempts to stop me from speaking or writing or publishing that much more ludicrous for our enemies. Suddenly, policies to ban and burn my books, such as in Canada, become even more transparently repressive.

All this is why the Jewish supremacists are screaming bloody murder at this achievement. They just can?t believe it for they know it cannot but help increase my credibility and thus the credibility of the message that I (we) carry to our people.

The University left no stone unturned in holding me to as high and perhaps even a higher standard than many of their Doctoral candidates because they knew that the Zionists and Neocons would excoriate them. They brought together some of the most respected Professors in Ukraine to examine my work and to challenge me in my Doctoral defense. Twelve men and women professors, at the pinnacle of their Academic careers, ultimately decreed my work of serious and significant scientific value.

They too know that they personally will face the malevolent power of the Jewish extremists. The courageous President of MAUP, Georgy Schokin knows it as well, but he stands as a rock of integrity and courage.

They have my undying gratitude for their intellectual courage and altruism.

Finally, I thank all of you, because only by your encouragement over the years in the face of the most extraordinary hardship and difficulties, could I have been successful in this endeavor.

I try to earn that trust and support everyday, and I am very anxious that all of you will continue to be pleased an inspired by my efforts both in my writing and speaking for our Cause.

I hope all members of EURO, all my friends and comrades on Stormfront.org, and my fellow leaders in all of the Movements for our heritage and freedom will share this accomplishment with me. You deserve the incredible support of all of us.

Thank You All,

For Our Heritage and Freedom!

Latest news **translated by H. Friedman, Kiev**

Jewish leaders in Ukraine are condemning the actions of a major university in Ukraine (MAUP) for awarding a full doctorate to the notorious American anti-Semite David Duke.

MAUP, an acronym for the largest university system in Ukraine, awarded the controversial former KKK leader and American politician, David Duke, a PhD in History after a successful completion of exams and all doctoral academic requirements, and a spirited Doctoral Defense in an art-adorned academic conference hall adjacent to the office of the MAUP President Prof. Georgy Tchokin.

MAUP is one of the leading Universities in Ukraine as well as Eastern Europe. Formerly a national university system run by the Ukrainian government, it was privatized after the fall of communism. It has grown to over 51,000 students with branches throughout Ukraine. Cooperative arrangements exist with other universities in a number of other nations and it has the highest academic accreditation possible both in Ukraine (4) and on the international level. UNESCO recognizes the MAUP university system as one the world?s high-level educational institutions. MAUP is the source of most of the bachelor and post-graduate degrees of the Ukranian Government officials and administrators. Such influence over governmental employees disturbs many Jews in the Ukraine who are concerned about lingering anti-Semitism.

Jewish spokesmen decried Duke?s earlier Honorary Doctorate awarded him by the University and his subsequent, quiet participation in MAUP?s Post Graduate Degree Program and his recent achieving of a full doctorate. They say it is proof of the anti-Semitic stance of the university and its staff. Duke?s dissertation subject was entitled, ?Zionism as a Form of Ethnic Supremacism.?

Abraham Ribacoff, who read Duke?s dissertation, which was similar to his book, Jewish Supremacism, commented, ?No matter how many examinations David Duke has passed, the volume of his research, number of academic citations of his dissertation, or the cleverness of his literary style, his work libels the Jewish people. It concludes that Zionism is an ideology of ethnic supremacy and that Israel is a Jewish-supremacist state. It?s all a lie. In truth, Israel is the only true democracy in the Mideast.?

Markus Gollman of Kiev said, ?No matter how camouflaged in pseudo-intellectualism his historical and scientific inquiry, for such anti-Semitic writings, he should be stripped of his Doctor?s robes and given a prison uniform. We will not rest until Duke and the fascist President of the university, Gergiev Tchokin, rot in jail.?

The ceremonies awarding David Duke a Doctor of Philosophy Degree in the field of history came just one day after Israel?s Ha?aretz newspaper reported that Israel formally demanded that Ukraine?s president Victor Yuschenko forbid MAUP President, Dr. Gergiev Tchokin, from being a candidate in the upcoming elections for the Ukranian Parliament.

Some members of the Jewish community though are afraid that such demands from Israel will be viewed as Israeli interference in the internal policies of Ukraine and will be seen as an attempt to stifle freedom of speech and political expression. They fear that such moves will only serve to validate the shrill claims of MAUP President Georgy Tchokin and David Duke that Israel wants to control all nations and seeks to stifle political freedom.

Duke, was a former member of the House of Representatives in Louisiana and Republican Party Chairman in Lousiana, but he is more well known for his former KKK activity. He has lectured frequently in the MAUP system since 2002 while he quietly fulfilled his Doctoral requirements.

On Friday, September 9, a senior academic council of twelve MAUP professors sat in judgment of his doctoral defense. The academics included some former high officials of the Ukrainian government. The council was headed by University Rector, Prof. Mykola Golavatiy, the former Minister for Ukrainian Youth Affairs"
,tomtomx,2006-10-20T19:10Z,"""Duke returned to LSU, graduating in 1974. He became famous on campus for wearing a Nazi uniform while picketing and holding parties on the anniversary of the birth of Adolf Hitler. The year of his graduation, he formed the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan.""
On May 29 2004, David Duke brought together in New Orleans leaders of the European Nationalist movement to sign an agreement that would ""mainstream our cause"". The New Orleans Protocol signatories pledged to avoid violence and internecine attacks. It was immediately signed by eight white supremacist and neo-Nazi representatives, most representing organizations, including the notorious National Alliance, and Stormfront. Duke signed on behalf of his new organization, European-American Unity and Rights Organization (EURO).
In 2005, Duke has teamed up with Don Black of Stormfront and now delivers a one-hour webcast six days a week."
,The_Student,2006-11-04T20:26Z,"Heh, anti-semites are so cute when they try to turn this into a science! And that interesting 'you may be imprisoned for learning the truth' thing only applies if you, say, take this to heart and begin dancing in the streets of countries with anti-hate laws screaming ""Hoax On Holocaust"". Nice try on making the downloading of this seem exciting, though."
