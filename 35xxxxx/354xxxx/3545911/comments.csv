I love both musical groups, they are indeed primo artists, and frankly my 9 year old could have done a better job just cuttng farts overtop of pet sounds.  The song-combinations don't make sense, and the editing is simply choppy and dismal.  Otherwise, I guess the ""author"" is a neat guy, I am just putting this comment here for downloaders to save their time unless they are curious to download somthing hideous."

Cheers !
