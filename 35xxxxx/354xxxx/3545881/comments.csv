,xxxgurraxxx,2006-10-26T04:19Z,WhatÂ´s a DIY rip ?
,furiousV,2006-10-26T04:21Z,"It's not from LOL or XOR

LOL should be released in about half an hour from now"
,groovydave1973,2006-10-26T04:21Z,"i think he means an ""Independent rip"" meaning not from the release teams like lol."
,andre321,2006-10-26T04:22Z,oh great.. i'll wait for LOL :P
,elninzo,2006-10-26T04:24Z,People that downloads this is just too stupid to even watch lost
,grigorij6da@hotmail.com,2006-10-26T04:25Z,what meens with LOL ?
,groovydave1973,2006-10-26T04:26Z,"Yeah andre..... do the square thing..... wait for lol or xor, better not take the risk with this new guy eh? 

Personally I think buzz deserves our support, he/she has got it here first, so we should give buzz a go, if its good we know to trust him/her in future.

Well done buzz for beating ""the big boys""!!!"
,furiousV,2006-10-26T04:33Z,"your right Groovydave

Buzz actually got Lost S3 Episode 3 out about the same time last week, people who downloaded that will know.

Thanks anyway Buzz!"
,bl00dfeast,2006-10-26T04:34Z,"crappy mpeg file , wait...wait.. "
,andre321,2006-10-26T04:35Z,um actually my internet is quite slow so id rather download a 350mb file instead of a 450mb one :)
,grigorij6da@hotmail.com,2006-10-26T04:49Z,less than 10 minutes left  when buzz will upload his torent 
,buzzinhornets,2006-10-26T05:41Z,"thanx to the 2 supporters!  yes, i beat the lol and xor releases and if you don't like it don't comment...  mutha-f..."
,_-WoK-_,2006-10-26T08:04Z,why compress it in mpeg 1 when mpeg 2 is better?
,giggity55,2006-10-26T08:35Z,"give buzz a chance... if you download... seed it fully pls.  He's faster than the competition, they are just better known and respected.  Besides... this will fill a niche market for those that prize quality over speed for those that burn a copy.  "
,giggity55,2006-10-26T08:42Z,I'm beginning to think I made a mistake.  The quality seems to be pretty poor despite the file size.  I will download a copy of xor and lol to compare.
,Superdooper,2006-10-26T11:02Z,I cant see a xor or lol file for episode 4? Is one up? and if so can you link it here pls. thanks
,IspinneN,2006-10-26T11:22Z,"XOR Release:
http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3545941/Lost.S03E04.HDTV.XviD-XOR"
,encoded evil,2006-10-26T19:17Z,and can some1 say if Buzz his realeases are ok?
,ronan001,2006-10-26T19:42Z,"This version is fine!! no ""next on lost"" though! why does no release include this? 

this format suits me better than the XOR releases. it takes much less time to render to vcd in Ulead!"
,pandahora,2008-05-20T20:40Z,"seed, please. i'm stuck at 0,0 %. it haven't moved in days. oh wait.. it have never moved -.-"
