,Elend,2006-10-23T02:02Z,"Thanks a lot for this 'Kraut-music'.  
Crasy, but I like this music today much more than in the '70th and '80th.
The Vinyls are old or broken and it's very difficult to get music from the 70/80th. Great torrents!!!"
,Fartmannen,2006-10-23T18:06Z,There will be some more goodies from the 70s but my upload rate(time too) is limited. More Amon will follow and possibly some other psycedelia stuff too. See you /F
,Burje,2007-10-29T20:41Z,My up AND download sucks so if I get them down I promise to seed for a loooong time!
