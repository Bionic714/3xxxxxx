Black Sabbath one of the most revered, cherished, and beloved heavy metal bands that this world have ever seen. 

This two DVDs published only recently by Sanctuary are a visual proof of their unparalleled charisma, as well as a swift chronicle through some of the highest points of their career. Volume one concentrates on the Ozzy days, and contains a lot of performances from that era, the infamous video for paranoid, shot in Belgium among others, as well as rare footage - like a top of the pops performance of "Never say die". Mind ya, just because of the sheer age of some of those clips, the image can get pretty dodgy now and then, and well, the sound is obviously an expansion of the stereophonic image. believable perhaps, but easily distinguishable as fake by the trained ear. In between the clips you get some juicy snippets from the members of the band, minus the Ozman himself, candidly talking about "the early days". Ah those crazy guys in Sabbath. Anyhow, moving to Volume two, we got the one and only, The King of Rock'n Roll, Ronnie James Dio, talking about his days in Sabbath, also the videos of "Neon Knights" and "Die young", but for fuck's sake, the interviews are dubbed over the intros and outcross of the songs, ruining some of them completely. I can't believe that they elected to do that. They could have done it as commentary or sty. It certainly is a very big con, as far as buying vol two is concerned. Moving on we got the Gillan album, complete with the Spinal Tap, Stonehenge incident, the Hughes days (the 7th Star) and last but not least Tony "The Pussy" Martin's Era, represented by The "Headless cross", "The Shining" and "Feels good to me" videos. The second DVD, ends with a couple of promo clips from the Reunion with Dio era of Dehumanise. Pretty strong Stuff, but again there's a complete ruination of certain songs by some stupid intervention. The menu design is greatly stylized, and most of the features are easily accessible. Overall, pretty good, but it could still have been done better.
