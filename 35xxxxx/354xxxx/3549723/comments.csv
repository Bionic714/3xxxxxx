Somehow I can't get the patch to work. Have downloaded 3 verskjons now, none works. If anyone get it to work please say how, thanks."

Thanks in advance"
,Aleximoz,2007-04-27T21:21Z,How do i open this?
,glussus,2007-05-20T10:35Z,"(It is a copy of a CD according to an iso-standard, of that the name)

either you burn it to a CD with for example ""Nero"", but I recomand that you get a program that makes you able to mount* it to the system as a CD. Can be done with ""Daemon tools"" or ""Alcohol 120%""

*mount = in this case it is to fool the computer that it has an extra CD-drive, and when the computer accesses this CD-drive it founds this CD-copy"

,blemishednicely,2007-11-22T20:22Z,"I want to burn this (and other) game(s) onto discs, so that I may free up space on my laptop-however I've never taken a game from torrent to disc & I only have so many discs currently available (not really up for trial & error). Could you tell me exactly how to burn it to disc (and actually get everything I NEED-i.e. install, startup, game data...don't have Nero, but do have Sonic RecordNow---game is currently represented by a disc icon in my documents/downloads folder do I take it from there or what? Really want to be sure I haven't wasted a whole disc solely on the desktop shortcut or icon...poppin' my cherry & don't want to bleed over the good linen----"
,blemishednicely,2007-11-22T23:27Z,"Since you're taking your time to answer, I have Jagged Alliance 2 Gold, (JA2) Unfinished business, & (JA2) Wildfire, they are taken from different torrents, but all are set in the same ""Strategy First"" program folder...is it possible for me to put all of them on one disc to maximize my hardcopy's efficiency? Or will they conflict with each other? If it is a matter of the disc becoming ""confused"" in order of op's., would disabling auto-run work? 1 disc beats 3..."
,blemishednicely,2007-11-29T11:57Z,"Trying to figure out if you're on vacation or telling me to go fuck myself...hello? Gotta free up my space pretty soon here for Kane and Lynch-would like my question answered, if possible..."
,blemishednicely,2007-12-10T12:02Z,"Well whatever, these are awesome! It's really a good job and everything seems to be there (even all the cheats-except for the IMP ""Clone"" code where you were s'posed 2b able 2 make 6 or so custom merc's so long as you did no X2 mugshots)!
I did crash a few times w/ codes pissing 'bout but some o/ the crashes are same as legit prod., other's aren't surprising if rationale is applied. Add that I use a Satellite Notebook. Decent one, but still not optimal, but then what is? Either way, 
this torrent is definitely worth it for anybody who likes the JA series, and do bear in mind the for-sale copy in stores had numerous by now well-known issues resulting in numerous patches 
before you complain about crashes...for instance 
I wouldn't suggest long chopper rides through enemy territory unless you REALLY enjoy the opening movie.  "
,blemishednicely,2007-12-10T12:07Z,"BTW couldn't get K&L to work so I said fuck it & ret'd to JA all over again. I'm coming for you, D :=
You gotta love the feisty ones, you know?"
,Viking[Swe],2008-07-13T19:50Z,"I have found the right version of Jagged Alliance 2 Wildfire the patch 6.04 are made for, but I downloaded from another Torrent place. Ideal Games have relased the game. If you want it I can give you the link or the Torrent file, but i do not upload anything here or another place. You dont need burn the image if you dont want, just extract the setup.exe from the image and install it from you harddisk. The serial number is in the nfo file"
,hootieman,2010-06-27T06:26Z,"can't find a serial number for this, always epic fail when it comes to trying to get this game oldie but a goodie, anyone know where I can get a generator? or a working serial?"
,Jayjaysuper,2012-03-24T14:37Z,"Yes this game does look juicy,hard to find these old turn based games any more.Anyone fancy helping a couple of us out with a serial,i have failed in my epic look also.thanks in advance to some kind soul."
