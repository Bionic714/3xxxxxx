Salò o le 120 giornate di Sodoma (1975)

Not the Criterion edition, but a decent copy anyway.

(from the case)

Pasolini\'s final and most controversial film has been banned, censored and reviled the world over since its first release.  The film is based on the Marquis de Sade\'s novel \"120 Days of Sodom\", with the setting transposed to Mussolini\'s miniature Fascist Republic of Salò, Italy in 1944.

The film\'s content and imagry is extreme, and it retains the power to shock, repel and distress a quarter of a century on.  Salò remains a cinematic milestone -- culturally significant, politically vital and visually stunning.

\'Pasolini\'s final feature has emerged to appal a new generation grown complacent on consumerism and passive on permissiveness\'
