,Jedih,2006-10-30T15:46Z,"Could anyone please seed the X2 5235 Bios for Xbox version 1.5?

PRETTY PLEASE WITH SUGAR ON TOP!"
,A Murder of Crows,2006-11-01T10:44Z,"i normally love GasGiver's releases, but the last 2 have had issues that seemed strange.

Xbox 2 Xbox transfers were screwy with 2006.10.11, and though this one works okay, it seems i can only write to the xbox i'm controlling, where as before i could read and write to both boxes from either, like UnleashX can.

lastly, MC360 Marketplace has been online for awhile, yet GG hasn't implimented it yet.

love ya man, but can you please do a bit more like eX's releases up on sky, at least with regards to MC360 marketplace and the ""extras"" blade?"
,icetoo,2006-11-03T10:17Z,"Ive got problem with weather also get this in my logfile: 
rarmanager::extractarchive error while extracting Q:\media\weather.rar"
,Tcip,2006-11-03T19:37Z,"icetoo - Did you clean the ""save"" files for XBMC before installtion the newer xbmc?"
,icetoo,2006-11-03T22:07Z,"Tcip -> Do you mean the ""0face008"" files, yes i have, does it works for you?"
,icetoo,2006-11-03T22:15Z,"Tried to download this release with same problem
http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3547015/XBMC-2.0-2006-10-27-FahxBahx-PROPER.rar

Any more suggestion, whats going on?"
,icetoo,2006-11-03T22:18Z,"Hmm, when i unpack the weather.rar local on my computer its unpacks fine, if I upload it to my Xbox and then back to the computer its somehow gets broken!? "
,icetoo,2006-11-03T23:02Z,"Some more test and now it works! =D
I had to set my FTP client (Transmit for Mac),
into another transfer mode:
Binary=Does work
AUTO=Doesnt work
ASCII=Doesnt work
but this apply to all FTP clients i guess!
Better report this to xmbc forum as well..."
,Tcip,2006-11-04T14:42Z,"icetoo - I mean all the hm i call them ""save"". It's placed in E:\ folder for me. The weather works for me"
