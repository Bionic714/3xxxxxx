,johajo,2006-11-01T12:36Z,"Hi, I  just wonder if this is an expansion? Do you need a game before this?
  //Jonis"
,TheBeast,2006-11-01T20:04Z,"No its a standalone game, you just need to install it and you can play the campaign and skirmish with all races.
But you can only play as tau and necrons in multiplayer.

You need a reg key and some cd-keys for that."

,sparxxx415,2006-11-30T12:59Z,"why does it say i need data3.cab during install. there is no data3.cab in the download, but only data1 and data2 how do i fix this"
,BlaMMo,2006-11-30T20:55Z,"steelynx what are you talking about?

This game is incredibly easy to get good at, the UI is not bad, its actually quite good and the tooltips tells you exactly what you need to know. They dont give you alot of background story about the units but they tell you what they do and what they can counter etc. I havent played alot of the tutorial, but it does explain how to play the game and anyone should be able to master this through some campaign gaming"
,Asking-All-Those-FAQ,2006-12-11T19:19Z,How does it come that DoW: Dark Crusade is more than twice as big as DoW and DoW: Winter Assault?
