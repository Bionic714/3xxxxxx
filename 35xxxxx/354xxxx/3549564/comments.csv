,jordanwb,2007-12-30T21:26Z,For all other MM2 Lovers. I am downloading this right now. When I get 100% I will seed for a long time.
,jordanwb,2007-12-30T21:30Z,If a No CD Crack comes with it; the first start will take a while. Why I don't know but it will slowly speed up.
,jordanwb,2007-12-30T23:46Z,I was able to download it and mounted it using Alcohol 120%. It won't run because of the CD protection. You can get a working No CD crack here: http://gf.wiretarget.com/mm/mm_102.rar It works and I use it personally.

1) Install the game. Install the XP Patch from the MM2 website. (Search on google.)

2) Download the NO-CD Patch by searching 'mm2 no-' on google. extract file to the install folder. replace existing file.

Have fun!"

,simonofhell,2008-12-20T15:45Z,"I have a problem here:

I installed the game, and the game's graphic's were totally fucked up

so, i installed the graphic fix from the mm2 website
but then it says i need to insert a cd
so i get a no-cd patch, but when i replace the exe with the no cd patch, the graphic fix stops working!

so it's either no playing or crappy graphics?

how do i solve this?"

,koorosh.pirate,2011-01-21T07:16Z,"After installing the Midtown Madness 2 fix for XP the game requires CD and the old patch doesn\'t work. So here is a updated patch created by unsafedisc 1.5.5:


1. Install Midtown Madness 2
2. Download & install official XP fix patch
3. Extract this updated patch
4. Copy \""Midtown2.exe\"" file to game folder
5. Run \""Midtown2.exe\"" and have fun!
