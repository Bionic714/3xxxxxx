,flynndownunder,2011-09-16T01:15Z,"Started this one several days ago and stuck on 76.7%. Others coming online have the same problem. I've found an excellent copy, plenty of seeds, almost 7GB in total, you get everything youâ&#x20AC;&#x2122;d expect from a file this size. The guy has done an excellent conversion on this one (looks like a ""frame by frame"" restoration). V10+ (itâ&#x20AC;&#x2122;s that good) A10. # Birdman.of.Alcatraz.1962.PAL.Hun.DVD9-Jethro 6.99GB. You gotta download this."
