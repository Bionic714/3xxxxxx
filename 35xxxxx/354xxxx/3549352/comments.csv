It seems to help a little in early games, but it still goes down to 3 or 4 frames-per-second after about 15 minutes, on any maps and even against only two A.Is at 50 population cap each.

Either it doesn't work as intended, or the removal of the debug lines alone isn't enough to really make a difference in the long term.

Gas Powered Games indeed disabled the A.I for a good reason as I can see now. I'll keep playing on-line, where the true performance resides for me."

Yes it 's true, on large map the game goes slow after about 1h on my computer (without my patch : ~20mn) , but it's much better on 10kmx10km map on my computer, I played against 3 AI without  slow down."

works great for me"
,dxreaper,2006-11-05T04:15Z,"somehow can't get to 'build' nuke missiles, not sure if it's a bug issue with the game or this lua file, since I can't find anything regarding the missing 'build missiles' icon on structures like nuke defense and such."
,KingMoila,2006-11-06T15:31Z,"Maybe they thought that nukes are a ""secret"" and they shouldn't be released in beta... or something."
,dxreaper,2006-11-09T09:38Z,"nah, not secret. this also applies to the tier 2 tactical missile defense. but it seems to only happen later in the game which makes it weird... if you do build them quick enough you'll get the 'build missile' button"
,Molokk,2006-11-10T02:38Z,"Can you create a speed hack for version 1.0.30 ?

If you don't want to, can you let us know how to do it ? Which line(s) of code do we need to delete/edit ? Is it just in the .LUA file ?

Thanks."
