A Night To Remember from 1958, ready to be burnt on DVDR or watch on PC.

Interesting audio commentary is also included (track 2).

The format is NTSC. The DVD was originally R1, but was made region free.
So, it should play fine even on standard R2 PAL DVD players.

But most people have region free players, so whatever.

Keep in mind, that, if you can, you should switch your DVD player to NTSC mode before starting the movie, that way it will look (and play) better, since the native format of the movie is NTSC and res is 720x480.

Story info:
------------

The movie is based on the book by the same name, set in the year 1912, and takes place on board the White Star Lines R.M.S. Titanic.

The story revolves around lots of different people, there are no real main characters. However, Lightoller gets the most screentime out of them.

This is the most accurate film about the Titanic made so far.

It shows a lot of what went on on-board the other ships (Californian, Carpathia..), and centers only on factual historical records and eyewitness accounts of survivors.

And finally, and most importantly, it does NOT make up some half-assed fantasy romance story to try and draw attention away from the actual historical event.
