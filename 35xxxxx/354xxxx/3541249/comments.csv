,Tourniquest,2006-10-18T10:33Z,"Did you shrink it? If so, how and how much?"
,Osaka,2006-10-18T15:35Z,"It's the main movie only, all extras removed.
About 82% of the original quality remains.
Only 18% or so was removed.

It's nearly impossible to see any visual difference from the original Criterion Collection DVD.

The audio commentary was left intact. Because it didn't take up much space, and it's interesting to listen to (if you're interested in the Titanic and stuff).

If somebody is really interested in this movie, he/she should help seeding it later.

The best my connection can do (upload speed) is 128kb/s. And when that is split over a large group of leechers, it will take some time..

So please people, help seed it after you complete it, for at least a week or more.

I have other stuff I plan to upload in the future and I won't be seeding this alone forever - if no one has an interest in helping seeding it, the torrent will die in a week or so.

It's a very rare (and good) movie, so some seeding help would be appriciated."
,FredCPA,2006-10-20T00:24Z,Thanks!!  Great flick!!
,Osaka,2006-11-22T21:50Z,"Hmm, this torrent is actually still alive I see.

I've long since deleted the DVD from my PC, so now it's up to you people to seed this rare movie and keep it alive..."
,First Impression,2007-04-12T14:14Z,Will seed this if I get all of it
,First Impression,2007-04-12T14:20Z,Just 185 days left.
,First Impression,2007-04-15T22:17Z,"Stuck at 92,7% :/"
,fasfasasffgsdg,2007-11-01T02:57Z,"Please seed, I need this bad. "
,NOTNOMDE,2007-11-05T04:42Z,"I need more people to seed!!! I almost have this one 97%. I really need this movie, once I get it, I will seed forever & I will reseed it as well..... 

thanks!! "
,fasfasasffgsdg,2007-11-06T00:13Z,"Cheers guys, got 100% just a while ago. Watching now, great film. I remember having this as a cd release during the nineties, needless to say, compared to that this has quality from another planet :D

I'll seed for several weeks.  "
,PhilippaRM,2008-10-15T16:04Z,Please Seed!
,PhilippaRM,2008-11-21T16:31Z,"What sort of file is this movie, because I can't seem to open it.."
,PhilippaRM,2009-02-08T19:44Z,"Well I was really looking forward to this, after it had finally finished downloading. But the sound is completely messed up and makes it impossible to watch. Really disappointed because I was looking forward to see this classic."

@ PhilippaRM


lol noob, the audio is the original AC3 tracks from the DVD, so in other words: perfect quality.
