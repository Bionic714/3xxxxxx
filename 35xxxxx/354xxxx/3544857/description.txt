Slo Burn was the first band John Garcia was in after Kyuss broke up. Also in the band were Chris Hale on guitar, Damon Garrison on bass and Brady Houghton on drums. The first four tracks are from their EP Amusing the Amazing, the rest were tracks that John Garcia and company reportedly didn't feel were strong enough to include on the EP and make it a full length record. Tracks 5-7 also appeared on Slo Burn's demo.
