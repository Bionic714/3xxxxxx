,dentman,2006-12-14T06:27Z,I have been trying to find an annoying series of beeps on my desktop without any luck. Today I installed this roboform and now my 1 week old laptop is doing the same beeping. I don't know if it is the crack or the program itself. Anyone else have thi beeping?
,dentman,2006-12-17T18:35Z,"Beeping is from mIRC which this program installs on your computer. This is spyware. mIRC is installed under the name spoolsv,exe and runs scripts every 60 seconds. I installed Robo and then uninstalled mIRC and it's files stored in folder etc. Anyone know how to see what is being installed (hidden)?"
