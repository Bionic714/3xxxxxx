Ben Folds performs the cover song \\\"Such Great Heights\\\" on \\\"Like A Version\\\" in the Triple J studio on 06-Sep-2006.  Ripped from streaming audio - converted to 128k MP3.  

There are two MP3s in this set.  


1.  Ben Folds - Like A Version (Live in Triple J studio).mp3

This is the entire 20 minute segment that includes:

Ben Folds performing a cover:
\\\"Such Great Heights\\\" by The Postal Service

and they also play one of his own songs: 
\\\"All You Can Eat\\\"

(not the best choice, IMO - not the most subtle song!)

Lots of banter between the songs.  


2.  Ben Folds - Such Great Heights (Live in Triple J studio).mp3

Just the cover song from the above file.    


Enjoy!
Shawn
