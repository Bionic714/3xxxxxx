COMENTARY By Ollie501 from Dorset, England:
Planta 4a is a truly remarkable film. A coming of age drama, dealing with first love,  basketball, the usual childhood mischief, and above all, friendship. Basically a comedy, this  will definitely bring laughter, and maybe a few tears along the way? I can't recall seeing a  coming of age drama with such a refreshing honesty suffused with sadness and humour since  'Stand By Me'. Oh, and by the way? it just happens to be set in the cancer ward of a hospital.
