,dientology,2006-10-22T21:11Z,"Sorry, I checked at IMDB and did not find the title there. Here's the Wikipedia article: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bridge_(Scientology_documentary)"

I got a lot of http blocks from Church of Scientology International."
,Kharmak,2006-10-22T21:46Z,Wow scientology is lame...

,theslackerman,2006-10-24T02:49Z,"imdb link:

http://imdb.com/title/tt0799954/"
,dientology,2006-10-24T05:13Z,"That IMDB link is wrong. The film is directed by Brett Hanover. 

Here's the updated Wikipedia link (wonder how long it'll last): http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bridge_%28film%29"
,Bishop0151,2006-10-25T22:56Z,I understand what the film maker was trying to do but I think that it falls a bit flat and isn't actually that informative. If you want to know more you would do better spending twenty minutes looking at http://www.scientology.org/ with your sceptic hat on and then checking out http://www.xenu.net/ for the more honest opposing view.
