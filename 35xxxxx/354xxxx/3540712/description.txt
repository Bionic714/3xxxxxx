From the same company who brought you Sim City brings you Sim Tower. In Sim Tower the player must maintain and develop a Tower. While this sounds simple as it is only one Tower the player must help direct traffic through elevators, generate revenue, maintain parking and various other aspects of maintaining a real tower.

Sim Tower in our opinion is another excellent game from Maxis as it keeps the user interested and entertained for several weeks of game play.
