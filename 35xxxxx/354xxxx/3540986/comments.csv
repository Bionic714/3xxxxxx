,CaRinn,2006-10-18T20:40Z,I've been having the same problem as morningwd
,luring1,2006-10-18T21:51Z,It works fine for me. Downloaded the lates daemontools and mounted it. Followed the instructions in the *.nfo file and everything seems to be ok.  Maybe it's something wrong with your graphic card.
,lambilimbo,2006-10-18T22:57Z,You can actually play it? You can make a family and stuff?
,kate522,2006-10-18T23:00Z,My computer does not open .nfo files. Can someone please tell me what the instructions are?
,Smile From The Street,2006-10-18T23:51Z,"  1. Unrar.
  2. Burn or mount with Daemon tools.
  3. Install the game:
     AHNW-MG5V-XBOX-LRLD-RULE
     LYMV-KFW9-EUCU-LXMN-ARLD

     ZK2S-LSVN-BYPP-3LOF-1RLD     IWR9-YUI4-CRLD-AALE-RTHE  

  4. Copy the cracked files located in the Crack directory on CD to your
     installation directory.
_________

(Put the crack in the TSBin-folder.
Anyway, thanks, the game works fine.)"
,morningwd,2006-10-19T00:20Z,"After having searched A LOT, i was so desperate that i looked what was wrong with this expansion comparing to the other ones.
And i realized that two folders was incomplete. so here is what i've done. 

/!\ my game doesn't crash anymore during the intro is running, i can go in my neighborhood and see that Pets is well installed (though i didn't try playing the game -i'd like to sleep ;-)) but there are still some problems, like it's not ""Pets"" that i can read when i have to choose my neighborhood, but still ""Glamour"", the game is in English (whereas everything's been installed in French) and when i want to quit the game, there's nothing written in the little window... i had the same problem when i installed ""Glamour Stuff"", i fixed it, but i don't remember how i've done, so if someone know, let us know please.

First folder,""TSBin"":
when i install the game, there's just 4 files : ijl15.dll, S2EP4.exe, and 2 other icons that look like the game one. when you look in other expansions folders, there is far more files and they haven't been copied. they are all the same for all expansions : just copy all the .dll & the .016 and .256 (i don't know if it's the same numbers for everybody) files of ""Open for Business\TSBin"" folder and paste them ""Pets\TSBin""

Second folder, ""TSData"":
there should be a ""Sys"" folder -which is one of the most important folders- and there was nothing on my hard disk. As you did for the previous folder, just copy the ""Sys"" folder from ""Open for Business\TSData"" and paste it in ""Pets\TSData"" -it's the same folder for all the expansions.

Then try to run your game. It has worked for me, even though it's not perfect at all.

If you have more informations to make it run perfectly, please post them!!!(if i have some, i will too ;-), i'm going to search more) thnx in advance."
,morningwd,2006-10-19T00:33Z,"oh and i forgot to say that i put the cracked icon instead of the real one as we are asked to do. but if i want to run the game with daemon tools for instance without using the crack, it asks me to put the ""Open for Business"" cd... have to fix that too....."
,morningwd,2006-10-19T00:46Z,"ok, i've tried to play and i can't create a family. well, the game runs and the crack is good.. but you need to find the good missing files, those which allow you to create a pet and make this expansion complete. If someone can help us... pleaaase. Good night"
,jacknjive,2006-10-19T11:32Z,"mine is working good, although a few problems when first downloaded reg the crack. i did notice that the Petsd loading screen took a while at first to start loading, i can only think some people may have mistaken this for crashing, i did at first. i ctrl alt del'd and saw that it said ""not responding"" but when i clicked back on it, it started runnin, strange.Goodgame though. Thnx"
,erm123,2006-10-19T12:48Z,"No, it was actually crashing.. the window would close and there would be an error box.. i've got mine working fine now."
,InfectedEye,2006-10-19T13:59Z,"Well, morningwd, uninstall Glamour again, it just fucked it up for me and now I'm happy to not have it installed anymore.
And if we all do as Smile From The Street told us to do, wich is; ""Put the crack in the TSBin-folder."" wich I myself had to do with the other expansions, everything should work great.

I'll update you if it worked for me or not ^^
Peace out ... / iE"
,Bertilsson88,2006-10-19T16:51Z,I still can't get it to work =(
,XazteR,2006-10-19T22:29Z,"PERFECT!
Like always!


Just go into the CD and open the folder named 'crack'
copy the 'simsep4.exe' to install. directory, and then, happy siming!"
,InfectedEye,2006-10-19T23:09Z,"As we said before, put the bloody crack in the TSBin folder wich is in the games folder as the original file's there.

And the little ""crahs"" you tlked about, yeah, I had that to. It stopped for about between 5 and 10 seconds and then it worked fine again.
Just taht, it takes a while to load in the begining. But perhaps you should start The Sims 2 with another expansionspack, like Open For Bussines wich I always use to do to have it work properly.

Hope it will work for everyone..
Peace out ... / iE"

,-OLDBOY-,2006-10-24T14:43Z,"Konstigt.

The only thing i did was... 

*installed the original Sims 2.

*Extracted the files in the
""Sims.2.Expansion.Pets-RELOADED"" folder.

*Installed Pets expansion, but to find the cd-key you got to have a program that can read nfo-files, the key is located in the RELOADED file in the folder you downloaded. 

* The game will update your original Sims 2 in the end of installation, and tells you to put in The Sims cd4. Then Pets cd1 again.

*When it was installed i couldn't find a crack in the folder, so i downloaded it at gamecopyworld.
And remember to put the crack in the TSBIN folder. Replace original exe. file.

The game should work without a problem!"

So follow these steps and the game will work. It did for me.

(1) Download the Torrent.
(2) Extract the files using Winrar.
(3)Mount the image using Daemon Tools.
(4)Go to www.gamecopyworld.com and find a no cd patch for the game that you have. Also you can searh for a no cd patch on google.
(5)Now that you have that put it in the folder under Sims 2 Pets, and click on the folder in the Sims 2 pets named TSBin. Paste the no cd patch.{Note you may have to unrar the no cd patch to.}
(6)Play the game and enjoy. 

This worked for me and also the other Sims ex I downloaded so I believe it is the problem. Enjoy the game.

P.S. To the uploader thx for the awesome upload.:)"

when you are NOCD cracking the game extract the files and copy the Sims2EP5.exe from the crack folder and paste in the TSBIN folder, this is in the games directory which should be something like C:/Program/EA GAMES/The Sims Seasons/TSBin

NOW: Go to programs, ea games, the sims 2 pets. Then instead of just copying it inside the directory you go to TSBIN and put it in there, then click on it and there you go. The game starts. (Creata a short cut to the crack and put it on the desc)"
,mison2005,2008-11-18T00:48Z,"Please help! When I install, it comes out okay, but when it wants to update the sims 2, it asks for cd-4, so I put it in, and then it comes up with an error that says something like(Error: Terminating installation! And then it deletes all the stuff it installed! HELP PLEASE!"
,SublimeDelusions,2008-12-01T01:51Z,"Torrent DOES NOT WORK.  Game freezes at ""insert disc 4"".  Even with using the above method of inserting the crack into the TSBin folder, the game deletes the crack.  Using the mentioned ""shortcut"" to run the game give the message ""sims2ep4.exe not found"".  

Process went like this:  
mount image in drive:  success
run install: success
Copy crack: success
move crack into TSBin folder: fail
Create TSBin folder and insert crack: Success
Game writes into created TSBin folder: Success
Copy shortcut to crack to desktop: Success
Game asks for disc 4: success
Click ok on disc 4: fail
Game doesn't see disc 4 and terminates installation.

Looks like you guys will have to crack a new one or find a way for the crack to work.  If there's a way to get this to work that's different from the instructions above, let me know.  "

,Harshal56,2009-06-24T13:51Z,"Downloading the torrent at 50 kbps hope it will work.One question is 50 kbps a slow speed? my torrent says my conection is perfect, I live in India, any answer please? "
,ZabuzaMox,2009-07-04T19:23Z,"Ok Know im downloading it at a speed of 35kb/(seed please) i know it works if u try, u dont have to extract the rar, try to mount it on DAEMON Tools Lite bla bla bla. thats it. SEEEED PLEASE!"
,LoopHole12111,2009-07-10T06:05Z," Ok. For those of you who still don't understand what you have to do, I'll put it here in easy understandable steps.

1) Download WinRAR at http://download.cnet.com/WinRAR/3000-2250_4-10007677.html and then install.

2) Download Daemon Tools Lite at http://www.disc-tools.com/download/daemon and then install/

3) Go to the folder with heaps of files named rld-s2pe and right click on the first one (Make sure you have WinRAR installed). it will have all your usual commands (open, delete etc.) as well as the commands ""Extract file/here/to rld-s2pe"". Click on file and extract to a folder where you can find it later.

4) After extracting you should have a .bin and a .cue file. This is where Daemon Tools Lite comes in.

5) Daemon Tools Lite can be found on the bottom-right corner toolbar thingy (where the clock is). Right-click, put ur mouse on Virtual CD/DVD Rom and click set-number of devices and 1 drive. 

6) Go back to Virtual CD/DVD Rom and you should have a Virtual rom above the ""set-number of devices option"". Put ur mouse over it and click Mount Image. 

7) Find the place where you put the .cue file and double click. You now have a mounted virtual drive. 

8) To install, double click and click Autorun or whatever it is. If it doesn't work go into the TSBin folder (on your virtual drive) and click SIMS2EP4.

,jjskywalker,2009-12-23T20:03Z,Yes this is an awesome download and it works but u guys should download Apartment Life then put a crack on so u wont have to worry about cracking the others again all u need is apartment life because is the last Expansion pack

,hawtie1614,2010-09-02T10:36Z,"FOR ANYONE HAVING PROBLEM WITH CD 4:
Just kill the installation when it asks for cd 4, hold ctrl alt + del and go to task manager then find autorun.exe in the processes tab and click 'kill process tree'. The game will still be installed in your program files and will work without a problem!
Thanks for the torrent!"
,musentango,2010-12-25T07:54Z,The cd key codes no longer work (either saying they're invalid or already registered). Neither do the cd key codes one can find on other websites that provide them. 
,musentango,2010-12-25T09:08Z,"Also, the game crashes when it's starting up. Anyone interested in this game is better off just buying it, imo. That's what I'm gonna do anyway, not worth the frustration trying to figure out how to A) Get a working registration key code, and B) Prevent the game from crashing again."
,candicetan,2011-02-03T10:54Z,i can install this but it crashes when it starts..i thnk there mst b a prob with the data files..
,abcdeclan,2011-03-06T19:10Z,"Looking into downloading this, but after downloading a stuff pack and completely fucking up my game, im not too sure.

Can anyone give me some in-depth instructions on how to install this?"
,artgurrl,2011-04-02T18:14Z,"I've downloaded this and it works perfectly!

This is how I did it:

* First, to do this you need a program called UltraIso, you can get it here (or just google it):

http://www.ezbsystems.com/ultraiso/

(I have the free trial, it works great and it can be ""valuated"" for forever)

1. I downloaded the Sims Pets-torrent and got a bunch of rar-files in my folder
2. I right clicked the first rar-file and chose ""Extract Here""
3. When the rar-files were extracted I got two VLC-files in my folder. You may get other types of files depending of if you have the VLC-program or not.
4. I right clicked the larger of the two files (app. 800 MB) and chose ""Open with UltraIso""
5. I inserted an empty CD (700 MB) in my computer
6. Once the VLC-file was opened with UltraIso I clicked ""Burn CD-Image"" at the top-bar. The icon looks like a CD with a flame.
7. Now it starts to burn
8. Once finished the game starts on it's own (or just remove the CD and put it in any other computer you want to install it on)

- I used this code : 
AHNW-MG5V-XBOX-LRLD-RULE 
and it worked perfectly. I didn't register, that is NOT NECESSARY to be able to play the game.

Remember:
THIS IS JUST AN EXPANSION PACK- it is NOT a playable game. You need the SIMS 2 game or any of the follower games (Seasons, Holiday etc.) to play it.
Once you have installed it you need to put another of your Sims games in the CD drive and play from that.

Hope this helps!"
,-boni-,2011-07-03T05:49Z,"@artgurrl
i followed your instructions and it all worked perfectly until i tried to open the program.. it just keeps saying 'please insert the correct cd-rom, select ok and restart application'. I have tried both my original sims 2 disk and the burnt pets disk.. nothing works! help!"
,BM7733,2011-07-25T10:43Z,is this for a Sims 3 or Sims 2..?
