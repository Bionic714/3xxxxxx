,_DeviouS_,2006-10-18T20:01Z,and you'll also find that almost everyone who still plays online cheats/hacks.. 
,tmjam2002,2006-10-23T09:34Z,Just because you don't know how to play doesn't mean you can blame people for cheating. This is an old old game and people still playing it online. They are pro's buddy. One week of playing this game can make you a pro with the computer not online.
,P4triiik,2006-12-05T21:40Z,"I cant start the game couse there's some problem with ""_SYSDUMP.txt"".. anyone had the same problem or know how to fix it?"

,Rickets,2007-01-13T01:20Z,"this release has a few strong points over the compressed, but when i tried this version the crack didn't work properly, the good thing is i got to try the two demos and read the tactics manual that were missing from the compressed version (i think)... i'm not sure why, but the message ""please insert cd"" comes up and if i hit any of the three options over and over the game still works, but you have to do it several times to start a level."
,_DeviouS_,2007-02-02T00:02Z,tmjam2002 there probably pro's but there cheating pros none the less!!  many times they openly admitted to cheating.. and well alls you have to do is watch them and see.. im not a retard m8 i think i can see when som1s using cheats or not..
,tmjam2002,2007-03-20T08:23Z,"Dude the only cheat there is to type ghostpit by pressing alt+c if I am not wrong. That makes your plane invisible. But even that doesn't work online. Since you aren't that good you just said that they cheat. Please I said the same thing before until they tought me how to fly real good. Now when I own you, I am sure you will say I cheat."

,FelpMan,2008-07-12T20:35Z,"Thanks for uploading, I got the game working without any problems, but the game itself is pretty dissapointing. Your plane moves much too slow, and I couldnt figure out where I was supposed to go. Also, online didnt work..."
