These weapons may seem like cutting edge technology, but the ancient Chinese invented these weapons--in some cases thousands of years ago. Host Michael Guillen will demonstrate how the ancient Chinese repeating crossbow was a clear precursor to the machine gun and we'll see how, more than a thousand years earlier, the Chinese invented a weapon that rivaled the European cannon. Explore how ancient Chinese armies developed battlefield strategies that shape how we go to war today.
