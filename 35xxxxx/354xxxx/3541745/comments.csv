,Kholdstare,2006-10-18T21:08Z,Does this work consistantly for anyone else? it doesn't for me. it opens a new window only once out of about 5 tries
,firepiper,2006-10-18T22:26Z,I think it helps if you download it first...
,firepiper,2006-10-18T22:59Z,"Well, you need to have classic installed anyway, should be on your macos install disc."
,unsui,2006-10-20T00:38Z,"Anyone know how to emulate this BEST GAME EVER on a intel imac?

,Mayer88,2006-10-25T13:23Z,Does anyone else have problems opening the torrent ? my client says 'bad file path component' - anyone know what to do?
,Mayer88,2006-10-25T13:45Z,"nevermind, solved the problem by using another client.
I'm on a MacBook, what do i need to do for the game to work ?"
,crafterr,2006-10-27T13:44Z,"im sorry im probbly just being a fag again but this game must have the gay'est name.

WTF IS IT ABOUT!"
,ProfiPimp,2006-11-06T20:58Z,"Well, it runs under Classic on Mac OS 10.3.9, but the video scenes are not being played (for a game, which lives from them, thats pretty bad) although openGL is installed. Anyone else has this problem?"
,szlaeyer,2006-11-09T08:30Z,"Hi guys, does anyone know how to make them movies show? I only get a black screen when the cutscenes play.... :(("
,mark429,2006-12-18T19:28Z,"I have a G5 anyone know a way to make this(or any os9 games) work on a G5?
Thanks"
[V],felch,2006-12-28T22:31Z,"In case anyone is wondering this game runs in CLASSIC MODE on the mac.  I don't even have Classic installed, so I haven't bothered.

It also contains Monkey Island I, II and three, although one of the versions needs a code disk which isn't with the game."
,neolycan,2007-01-01T15:44Z,"For those running on newer mac's, go the the link below and download the mac version...  It will allow you to play most old lucas arts games, even if said games are for pc.  I've run PC versions of games such as Full Throttle, Monkey Island 1-3, The Dig, Sam and Max:  Hit the Road, Maniac Mansion, Zak Mcracken and the Alien Mindbenders, Day of the Tentacle, Indiana Jones and The Last Crusade, Indiana Jones and The Fate of Atlantis.  You can also run the mac versions of say the Monkey Island games, The Dig, etc, and they do have better sound and graphics so it is recomended.   Though I've not tried it with Monkey Island 4 yet it should work.  With the PC and Mac versions of the games I just copied all the files to a folder and used the programme below to load them.  Finally the link!

http://scummvm.org/

BTW they have full versions of two games they are allowed to distribute, Flight of The Amazon Queen, and Beneath A Steel Sky.  I recomend the latter, but both are good if you like Classic Lucas Arts games.  Oh and Scummvm is or was (hopefully still is) working on coding into it's programme the ability to play Sierra AGI games, such as Space Quest, King's Quest, Police Quest, etc...  "
,Topcat79,2007-02-11T16:03Z,"Hi, i just got this game down loaded and i cant get to work. Got scummvm but cant add thie game to it. I have mac os x... Someone please help have been looking forward to play this game!!!"
,snarlpatrick,2007-06-04T14:40Z,"Doesn't work in Scummv because the cd's contain the installer program, not raw data for scummv to interpret. So if you're on an intel mac like me, don't waste your time dl'ing unless you're prepared to emulate os Classic."
,bryce6.1,2007-11-28T02:58Z,Can more people please seed? I'm almost there! =S
,bryce6.1,2007-11-29T10:54Z,Thanks for the seeds! =D
,bryce6.1,2007-12-18T07:42Z,"Hi, I'm running on an iBook G4, OS 10.3.9, and I also can't get the cutscenes to work (Only the first one works, and sometimes only). Either there's a black screen, or they show a still from the previous cutscene.  What can I do to remedy this?"
,VileCore,2008-06-13T14:21Z,"@ crafterr: You think this game has a gay name? Wow. Talk about pot calling the kettle black. You never heard of the Monkey Island games? What are you, 9?"
