,ilive4harleys,2007-09-24T00:02Z,"Critic first of all your mentality and intelligence are appropriately shown in the fact that you do not even know how to properly spell boycotT. Buy a dictionary schmuck. Pity how the educational system in your country has failed you. Next while everyone is entitled to their opinion, people seem to mistake the American people for the boneheaded decisions of the boneheaded President and Congress of America. Most Americans are against the war, against having anyting to do with the Middle East and for getting the hell out. Do NOT blame us for Bushs' incompetence (in so many different ways including the Katrina debacle, the Gonzalez debacle and so much more). If America is so bad, why are there so many people from ALL around the world trying to get in. We may not be perfect, and it is the governmental and political issues you have a beef with, you should make that distinction. Everyone bashes America until you need our help then you come whining and begging, hat in hand. America is far from perfect but of the whole of the countries around the world, it is far better than most of the places elsewhere. Go live in Darfur or the Sudan, or a cave in Afghanistan. Have you even ever been to America? At least we don't have suicide bombing psychoes here. School shooters yes and on one occassion a domestic terrorist yes but it is still safer than elsewhere. And I will quote the shirt that I often wear, ""Don't blame me, I didn't vote for Bush"". Or ""The end is almost here"" (elections are next year). Hopefully, we will get a leader who knows how to lead."
