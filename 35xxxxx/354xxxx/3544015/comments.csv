,dontleech,2006-11-03T04:20Z,"Great seed, thanks! I had a few problems with the patcher, it preferred if I selected the .BAK file rather than the .dll file, but still, works great!"
,anpe91,2006-12-13T13:15Z,"more seeders plz...
0 seeders at the moment and  I really want this program..."
,anpe91,2006-12-13T13:17Z,I mean.. what's the point of making a torrent if its no seeders??
,Ash_Katchem,2006-12-16T11:27Z,"Can anyone tell me how to use the patch?
I don't understand where I'm supposed to put it."
,Ash_Katchem,2006-12-16T12:59Z,"LOL! Never mind, I figured it out :-)
for anyone else who is confused:
Find the Loquendo program (use file search) and open it. Open the directory and move the patch into it, then double-click the patch.

I'd quite happily buy this software if only it was for sale. I can't understand why they haven't put out a version for sale to the public. "
,Ash_Katchem,2006-12-16T13:20Z,"Does anyone know how to use TAGs?
DSpeech (good freeware TTS) has a ""custom tag"" option for Loquendo but it doesn't seem to work with Susan. I'd like to be able to access the options for laugh/cry/sigh etc."

,Ash_Katchem,2007-12-24T00:15Z,"Thanks Electro, I found that Trojan too. But is it harmful? On another page I found this comment:

""most keygens are recognized as malware, trojans and viruses. if you have it from a real (trusted) source you can be sure, there's no bad code inside! obfuscation and exe/runtime compression - might be used for viruses, but most of the time a common way of decompile protection, positive virus matches due to heuristic.""

So maybe it's a false positive..
Does anyone know how to check?"
,skwiez,2008-03-10T22:27Z,"My copy of Symantec Antivirus found no problems with the keygen, it seems alright."
,skwiez,2008-03-10T22:48Z,Although it just crashes when I run it...
,skwiez,2008-03-10T22:59Z,"Oh, I got the crack to run after I renamed the file to something shorter. Weird."
,hsntest,2008-04-07T21:09Z,"Hi..
This is my first day in pirate bay...
I am downloading the software...not getting more than 1kbps....please some one seed it...
and BTW does we have to download any other program for this to work.....?"
,gusplouf,2008-10-16T14:21Z,"How the patch is working. The file is 0 Kb and even if I click or double click on it or if I change its name or whatever it is not a win32 file.

Please help me on this one"
,Optics233,2009-01-15T19:12Z,"I downloaded installed and patched, but how do I run the program? There's no exe!"
,VenomGRtNL,2009-01-17T00:33Z,WARNING!!! It is infected with a Trojan!!! (got damn it! I have tried more than 10 times to dwnld from various torrent sites and aaaall TTS softwares are INFECTED! :-(
,Rayovak2.5,2009-03-28T01:04Z,"that is no trojan it's a keygen. dumbass....
i haven't downloaded but what the others say of the ""trojan"" is:loquendo_tts_text-to-speech_no-license-key-needed_all-voices-patch_>CRACK"
,Rayovak2.5,2009-03-28T01:05Z,where it says crack is the keygen.
,TrondHalvorsen,2009-08-06T18:25Z,It's not a keygen. It's more a dll-file with a program attached that will rename the old dll-file and insert the patched one.
,perniflard,2009-10-24T23:14Z,Trojan detected ! Download at your own risk !
,setotitan,2010-01-06T04:40Z,"just upped the new Loquendo TTS 7 package with TTS Director, TTS Diagnostic, and TTS Voice Experience: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5261377 get it while it's hot cause i'm not sure how long i'll have it posted. just took me so long to get it i had to share ;) "
