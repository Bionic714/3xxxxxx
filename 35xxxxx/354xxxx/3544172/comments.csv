,satchel,2006-10-23T17:45Z,"Additional notes:
- File format is .ttf (of course). Thought I should mention that. That means that these fonts will work on Linux systems, older Windows versions (such as Windows XP) and Macs.

- I accidently set bit size of this torrent to 250 kB. Hope it won't cause too much trouble.

Enjoy."
