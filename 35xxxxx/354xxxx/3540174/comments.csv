,TheDeathCalls,2007-05-05T21:51Z,"Guys.. It WORKS for all games. I tried it again on May 5,2007 for new games and it still works. Are you sure you are doing everything right? If you have any problems, post and i'll try to help you when i can"
,shakyna,2007-05-26T00:57Z,works perfectly thx!!! i tried it with nanny mania... really works!
,TheDeathCalls,2007-05-27T00:36Z,"judy74 you must have a torrent program like azureus or utorrent. I suggest utorrent as you seem to be new. get it here: http://utorrent.com/download.php
After you install it, open the program window and drag the file you downloaded into the program's window. Check settings and download. If you have connectability issues (NAT problem), check google. There are many guides to fix it."
,azureene,2007-06-12T04:55Z,I just tried this with Puzzle Detective and Private Eye: Greatest Unsolved Mysteries and it didn't work for either. =(
,TheDeathCalls,2007-06-12T19:57Z,You probably ain't doing it right.. Read the instructions and do exactly what they say..
,azureene,2007-06-14T15:09Z,Your instructions are simple.  I did do them and it doesn't work.  It says the codes were invalid.
,jjooten,2007-07-06T14:46Z,"i have found it works great on every game a good keygen but one lil problem it dont work with vista if you could fix it would be helpful

,staraflur,2007-07-12T12:16Z,This definitely works on newly released games.
,gravis57,2007-07-17T01:22Z,doesn't work for me on vista. invalid unlock code.
,jasp727,2007-07-19T03:28Z,"This KEYGEN does NOT work in Vista!

But it works fine in XP.

I have tried disabling the connection, blocking via the firewall etc.  Nothing seems to affect it.

The game states ""invalid unlock code"" everytime in Vista!"
,TheDeathCalls,2007-07-23T09:13Z,Ok. So we got to the sollution! THIS KEYGEN IS FOR XP ONLY. this is NOT vista compatible. I couldn't know earlier as i use Xp and not Vista.. Enjoy!
,procko,2007-09-21T14:05Z,"For some new games there's no option ""I'm not connected to the internet"" and no product code appear."
,p3189,2007-11-26T10:48Z,"if there don't have ""I'm not connected to the internet"" but still have pay on web u can use that code too just need copy that specal code in to keygen.

,lhainesky15,2007-12-01T05:00Z,"can you help me use this torrent, coz it doesnt seem to work,everytime i download it, a 1kb of torrent file is just what i download"
,TheDeathCalls,2007-12-03T15:36Z,"you must have a torrent program like azureus or lhainesky15 You must have a torrent client. I suggest utorrent as you seem to be new. get it here: http://utorrent.com/download.php
After you install it, open the program window and drag the file you downloaded into the program's window. Check settings and download. If you have connectability issues (NAT problem), check google. There are many guides to fix it."
,Jim.R,2007-12-04T04:18Z,"New Game

CRADLE OF PERSIA

Product Code:

EACC-39HG-Q5OB-3YMZ-694

Wrong Product Code!

Newer games seem to start with ""E"" in the product code.  Looks like they nuked the KeyGen again"
,littlenell,2007-12-07T18:01Z,has worked fine with all games for me apart from the new codes that have come on the games gets invaild code. Anyone got a new one for the new games please
,kyinsweden,2007-12-08T20:13Z,"YES this does work. found it on a blog and i have try it on two different games. i do not take credit for this either .Go into the last game that you used the ZWT keygen on and it worked. Open the game folder and then open the ReflexiveArcade folder. Find the files that read Arcade.dat (it may even simply say just Arcade and the file extension might not be showing for you) and also find the reflexivearcade.dll file extension. Copy BOTH files and go to the new game you downloaded which the keygens no longer work on. Open the game folder, and then open it's ReflexiveArcade folder. Now PASTE both files into this folder and click YES TO ALL. Once you have done this, relaunch the game and use the same method to crack with the ZWT as you did before."
,littlenell,2007-12-11T11:30Z,"thanks for the  tip, i tryed it and worked :P) thanks again"
,monstern,2007-12-13T23:15Z,"According to kyinsweden's guiding, it doesn't work any more. i've done for several times but now when i copy both files and open new games, it said that an application error -- there was an error initializing application. It will now exit. --and my new games can't open. This problem, however, not occur if i only copied  a file called Arcade.dat, all games can open but can't crack. What should i do!"
,littlenell,2007-12-15T13:44Z,well i just tryed in again on one of their new games monstern and it worked so ni why it wont for u
,monstern,2007-12-15T14:31Z,well....it doesn't work just this game--Azada

I got it! Here are the steps. But I have to do it in 2 separate portions since we are not allowed to add too long comments.

GO TO http://crackteam.ws/get.shtml?216286. CLICK ON 'PLEASE CLICK HERE FOR DOWNLOAD' and downlpad (300afea95a164b9965d809b89c72923bc24.zip). Run all sort of virus and spyware checks before you open the zip file. Open zip file & doubleclick on folder that reads 
(All Reflexive.Arcade.Games.v2.0_CRK-FFF). Read the README.chm file for instructions. But I have summarized it here in the next comment box.

22.Posted by superrmom on Dec 14 2007 at 01:43
(continued)
The readme explains there are two methods to crack a game file 
when ready to use the (FFF-ReflexV2.exe) file:

a) Select Method 1 (unwrapper) only if your downloaded and installed game has a "".RWG"" file (you can look in the actual game folder under Program Files/name of your game/ReflexiveArcade folder). If it doesn't,you must use Method 2.
b) Select Method 2 by identifying the actual game executable file and 
replacing it with a patch file to allow for the full version game. 
Here is how. Doubleclick on FFF-ReflexV2.exes, Select Method 2 check box, leave AUTOFIND selection checked and click GO. When prompted with a directory window, find the game's .exe file location and click open. The crack file will do its thing and give a message of completion. Now exit and go play the full version.

,littlenell,2008-01-08T11:11Z,monstern i gave it a try and sad to say it didnt work same now with what kyinsweden said doesnt work no more either
,monstern,2008-01-08T11:57Z,i try and it really works.
,violet62,2008-01-16T02:13Z,This does work just great with every game I have tied as of today. The read-me that comes with the file explains more how to use it. Thank you Mostern!
