Works with almost all games of reflexive.
Instructions:
When you start the game 1)choose the option Alredy Paid.
In the next window there is an underlined sentence that says I'm not connected to the internet. Click on it. In the next window, a code will be showing like this:
XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXX.
Copy the whole code and paste it on the product code on the keygen. Then hit gen on the keygen and copy the code to the reflexive game you want to unlock.
If you want further help plz write a comment.
