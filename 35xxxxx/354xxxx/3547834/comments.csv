,Gaggaa,2006-10-29T18:48Z,No seeders...maybe fake... Is here somewhere Screener or DVDRIP of Texas Chainsaw Massacre-The Beginning???   Cam and TS-versions what i have downloaded was awful quality.
,fastflow,2006-10-29T19:09Z,Been on torrent-hackers site (which is crap!) and the only torrent for saw3 is a cam....So i'm assuming this is the same torrent
,penol738,2006-10-29T19:17Z,"nothing on nforce.nl or VCDQUALITY.COM

probably a fake. I'll hold until the uploader can supply some screens"
,parlyzone,2006-11-02T12:35Z,"Screeners can be available at the premiere! The studio sends out screeners to partners, sponsors and others, so drop the bullshit guys.. How do you think Dirty Sanchez - The Movie came out so fast?!

I doubt this is a screener though.."
