,tibanu10,2011-07-07T19:19Z,i have a problem....when the race is almost over the ground dissappears..... can u tell my why?
,Zeiken,2011-07-12T20:45Z,@tibanu10 I also encounter that same problem. The game is broken... This happens way to commonly for me and my brother. I can't see anything and I always crash... Download another version of NFS. I think Most Wanted is better.
