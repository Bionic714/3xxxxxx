Gary Lineker presents highlights and goals from 
the day\'s Premiership fixtures in Saturday\'s 
Match of the Day.

Portsmouth were early table-toppers, racking up 
a five-match unbeaten streak to equal their 
best-ever start to a top-flight season, but 
today they face a stiff test of their 
credentials when they travel to champions 
Chelsea.

Pompey have not beaten the Blues in the league 
since 1957.

A big London derby features Tottenham against 
West Ham, while further north at the Riverside, 
Middlesbrough will be looking to change their 
record of managing just one home league win 
over Newcastle United since 1991.

Two teams looking increasingly likely to be 
battling relegation this season are Charlton 
and Watford - they meet at The Valley.

A couple of north-west derbies see Wigan host 
Manchester City and Bolton travel to Blackburn.

And elsewhere, in-form Aston Villa and Everton 
welcome Fulham and Sheffield United 
respectively.
