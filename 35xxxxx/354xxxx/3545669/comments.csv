,Overlord123,2006-10-25T19:18Z,Seed please!
,delukard7,2006-10-25T20:52Z,"the guy is seeding i see one with 100% 
i was wondering i know we have to pay to play but this .iso needs to be cracked?"
,Shojin,2006-10-25T21:06Z,"The one seed is me, this is the first site I uploaded it too.  Anyway, theres no cd key so it doesn't need to be cracked.  The only thing you need is a Hunter License."
,Watcher77,2006-10-25T21:15Z,"Hopefully this is the US release, it looks a tiny bit smaller then the JP version. Thanks Shojin."
,bapple,2006-10-25T21:33Z,Please continue seeding when you're done!
,Shojin,2006-10-25T22:02Z,"This is the  Us Release,  I .iso'd it myself"
,Dokupon,2006-10-25T22:56Z,"Gotta seed this one for a while, thanks a lot man."
,delukard7,2006-10-25T23:32Z,i have a 360 and will playt there but my syster wants to play so she'll play with the pc version.
,afi84,2006-10-26T00:04Z,shojin can u please confirm that u dont need the cd to play the game
,neo2120,2006-10-26T01:10Z,cant seem to find a seeder anyone know if this is on newgroups yet?
,afi84,2006-10-26T01:17Z,"umm yah i think we all know that, what does that have to do with there being no seeders"
,Antipika,2006-10-26T01:25Z,"ROFL 1337 pieces of 4MB :D

First time i saw that ^^"
,neo2120,2006-10-26T01:32Z,The ps2 version is all over the place....  I'm surprised especially because of what shojin said (no CD key required) that the PC version isnt easier to find by now
,deathbit,2006-10-26T01:47Z,"well i have to say this sucks for one its no were on the internet and 2 lol everyone is near 6.8-8%...

soooo eventually i hope there is seeders because when im done im fin seeding this and posting on katz.ws"
,deathbit,2006-10-26T01:50Z,OOOOO and what copy protection is this and is it  perfect? like u dont need  any anti securerom protection or protstop?
,delukard7,2006-10-26T06:16Z,i can't see any seeders were all stuck at 13.4%
,Shojin,2006-10-26T06:52Z,"Okay guys, hang tight.  I compressed the iso and now it will only be 1 gig, and no need to uncompress it will work.  I am transfering the iso right now to someone who has a much better upload speed then me.  Once he gets all of it, we will both seed.  I will upload it here in roughly 5 or so hours.  Hang tight please, and sorry for inconvinence."

,tensaichi,2006-10-26T07:08Z,How the hell does 5.2GB compress to 1GB?
,Macman430,2006-10-26T07:18Z,"ISO's aren't compressed at all, I can imagine getting it down to 1-2GB's using WinRAR."
,laggingsavant,2006-10-26T07:29Z,"If he made the ISO by doing a 1 for 1 dump of the DVD, you get every last bit into the resulting ISO file (5.2 GiB)... The installation files themself are probably 1 gig. Looking forward to the Repack shojin."
,Rip-Saw,2006-10-26T07:35Z,"Allright, I can't wait to DL this and start paying Sega $10/month ---___---
I'll look to seed the file as long as possible (until they take my bandwith away)
Rip-Saw, FOmar, BlueBurst, E200"
,bfcake45,2006-10-26T07:37Z,how do you burn this to dvd? will it fit on a normal one?
,DioBrando,2006-10-26T07:39Z,"I'm amazed that a major game with no copy protection has only one torrent on the internet, and that that torrent has one person seeding it.  Thanks for at least making it available, but next time, compress it, and get at least 5 people seeding it."
,jribanez2002,2006-10-26T07:42Z,is that possible? to have a 5gig file into 1gig size compressed? and What do u mean Hunter Lisence? :)
,jribanez2002,2006-10-26T07:43Z,"YOU CAN DO IT, shojin!!!:) "
,DioBrando,2006-10-26T07:44Z,"jribanez2002, the ""Hunters Liscence"" is basicly a subscription fee for the online portion of the game, $9.99 per month.  There is a full offline game as well though."
,jribanez2002,2006-10-26T07:47Z,"oh i see.. by the way, you can play single player without paying the subscript fee, right? thanks for the info DioBrando. :)"
,delukard7,2006-10-26T07:48Z,"ok we'll waith for you shojin
 i was thinking that you werent abouth to share the game anymore."
,tensaichi,2006-10-26T07:49Z,Whys he waiting 5 hours to upload it anyway?
,delukard7,2006-10-26T07:50Z,so that means thatt this torrent is useless shojin?
,DioBrando,2006-10-26T07:53Z,"tensaichi, it seems that he's probably compressed it by now and is uploading that to a friend with better up speed so that we can get the ball rolling on this torrent faster.

This torrent will probably be made useless very soon, I don't see the seed anymore so it's probably safe to delete."
,jribanez2002,2006-10-26T07:54Z,i dont know if its better to wait or download the file now. what do you think guys?
,jribanez2002,2006-10-26T07:56Z,"oh.. thanks again DioBrando.. about my question earlier, its not free even though we're playing single player?"
,DioBrando,2006-10-26T08:04Z,"No, single player is free.  You only need to pay the $9.99 subscription fee if you want the online component.

Even if you wanted to try downloading this massive 5 gig file, I don't think Shojin is even seeding it anymore."
,Rip-Saw,2006-10-26T08:05Z,I've stopped trying to DL it now. I'll delete it in the morning when the new one is up. I hope the network admins don't get pissed at me uploading so much in a few hours 
,delukard7,2006-10-26T08:12Z,"we'll we were at 13.7 in only few hrs
But maybe is better to waith."

,jribanez2002,2006-10-26T09:35Z,tomorrow it is then! thanks guys!
,tfujiwara,2006-10-26T10:12Z,yah so this is the only torrent out there for the US release...hope to see the compressed version soon with more seeds!!  Thanks shojin for the up!  
,Zelest_c,2006-10-26T10:43Z,"Ooookies, I'll be patient =)"
,Shojin,2006-10-26T11:51Z,"Okay, this torrent is now dead.  Go here for new one http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3545972"
,Ziggarius,2006-10-26T12:01Z,"Everyone, if you see this comment, Shojin's compressed Torrent is now up at:
http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3545972"
,Ziggarius,2006-10-26T12:03Z,"Hah, figures, choose not to wait for comments to load and I don't see Shojin's already pointed to his new compressed, yay! ^_^"
,KoroshiyaHunter,2006-10-26T16:06Z,680 leeches and no seeds. Let's get the ball rollin'.
,Shojin,2006-10-26T16:24Z,"Okay, this one still works.  Again I deeply appologize, apparently WinHua and 7z lied to me =/ They said the archive had no errors and the data file sizes were the same as this one.  Anyway, this one still works and we have another more efficent file on the way which will be seeded more, a 000 file.  Look for that soon, otherwise keep trying this one.  I'm sorry for the inconvinence."
,Shojin,2006-10-26T16:35Z,"Okay, more updates. Both this iso and a 000 file are being ftped to multiple people, which means more seeds for both files, just in case one doesnt work for people.  The 000 seems to install faster for me, but both still work and I fully installed both, so they should work.  Again sorry for inconvinences, WinHUA sucks =p.  

 Enjoy, EVENTUALLY!"
,Shojin,2006-10-26T16:41Z,"You don't have to wait, the 5 gig iso and the 000 file I will be uploading do work, I tested them to full installation.  A corrupted torrent wont happen again, I promise.

Please apprecaite the effort, thanks."
,shunohoko,2006-10-26T17:01Z,"kind of sucks I deleted this torrent for the compressed but hey, you can't really complain when you arent paying for the game huh?  Thanks shojin for not givin up on seeding."
,mightymage879987,2006-10-26T17:13Z,how come it stopped at 27percent is it fake or broke
,Shojin,2006-10-26T17:14Z,"I'm really sorry, I was just trying to get it out faster.  The compressed past corruption inspection, so it was a shock to me too.  I just hope I can make up for it by getting as many seeds as possible on this one."
,delukard7,2006-10-26T18:34Z,are you seeding or not shojin.We apreciate the efford but at least keep seeding this one. 
,Trollhammer13,2006-10-26T19:05Z,Wow downloading @ 0kbps.
,delukard7,2006-10-26T19:19Z,the pirate bay says 3 seeders but were all stuck at 17%
,Ultema,2006-10-26T19:27Z,Is... there any good and / or logical reason in particular that whenever a Seeder comes on... my download rate drops from 90kps... to 0 - 100 BYTES? :X
,casalmm,2006-10-26T19:39Z,0kbps on two
,Ultema,2006-10-26T19:49Z,Oh man I had like a 2 second burst of 30k XD that was sweet :( Whoever is seeding is stealin' mah megahurtz! :(
,delukard7,2006-10-26T20:18Z,well on bitcomet i don't see any seeder at all
,casalmm,2006-10-26T20:18Z,"Hey the 5G stop in 15,8% and 1G stop in 27%
Why?"
,delukard7,2006-10-26T21:18Z,oh i know about seeders and peers but the problem is that there is no seeder on bitcomet only peers stuck at 19.5%
,Hannibal01,2006-10-26T22:47Z,"First of all thanx for the torrent of this game, i am realy thankfull.
Then i would like to ask if someone has already finished downloading this game, if yes then please pm me or write a coment here.

Once more thank you very much."
,deathbit,2006-10-27T00:11Z,heres a better soulution give the game to like a few freinds to ost just show them how and link them so we all can get the game but anyways..... that games out tomorow and im just going to pick it up anyways i think mabe u guys should to
,Kevwin,2006-10-27T00:12Z,:( I really want this game but I cant download anything over 4gig because of my hdd type or something :(
,DioBrando,2006-10-27T00:31Z,"Shojin, generally to cut down on filesize what you do is you split the ISO into a bunch of .rar files.  Still, thanks for making this available, but you should look at how other groups release their games."
,Shojin,2006-10-27T01:11Z,"Ya, I've been splitting the file types and trying to send them to a few of my friends ftps, but even then its slow.  My upload rate just blows, but Ill have a better u/l speed by friday supposedly.

At the moment Im making 1 Gig parts."
,goldanthrowolf,2006-10-27T01:12Z,"Hmm.  For some reason, now that it's at 20% for me, it's dropped down to like 2k a second.  I see 1 seeder, and 300 peers/leachers.  Previously from about 12-20% I topped out at like 500k (I got a bitching DSL line :D)  

Though I tweaked AZ a bit, and dropped it down to like 100 connections globally/per torrent, tweaked with the up/down speeds, nothing seems to help.  Is there perhaps a problem with the tracker/seeding somewhere?  I know there are quite a few people (via the statistics) that have more then 20% so, what gives?  

Not that I'm worried, working on some work (redundant I know) and won't get to fiddle with it for a few days, still, kinda irratating hitting 500K for abou 20mins, then dropping back to dirt speed :("
,goldanthrowolf,2006-10-27T01:17Z,"If I had a way for it to be sent directly folks, I'd 'share it full tilt' as I got nothing better to do with a 600/100 KBS DSL at the moment.. sure, it's not a TRUE T1, but hey it's close :D  

If anyone wants to IM me, and try to send it that way, or something, I'll host it.  I'm just doing medical transcription, and need something to poke my nost at every 10 or so minutes so I don't die from boredom.  

I already downloaded, Fire Warrior, Dreamweaver 8, Roller coaster Tycoon 1, 2, 3, the Burning Crusade for Wow, and god knows what elese, and Iv'e not even tried them yet. o.O  So yah, if anyone wants me to throw anything up, find away for me to download and I'll share it."
,goldanthrowolf,2006-10-27T01:18Z,"Dur.. helps if I include my IM name. 

Y! GoldAnthroWolf, or AIM same thing. 

*slaps self*"
,Shojin,2006-10-27T01:42Z,"Sorry, 100 mb parts, not 1gig.  Should get more seeders soon. "
,goldanthrowolf,2006-10-27T01:43Z,Did you re-start the torrent or something?
,Trollhammer13,2006-10-27T01:58Z,Post the FTP address here and I'll help seed too.
,deathbit,2006-10-27T02:10Z,well its over for this torrent many new ones have been relesed just look around in 96% done now :P good luck
,saltytaco,2006-10-27T03:00Z,"Can you post a working torrent?  All the others I see have the same issues, no seeds :("
,Kenshin_x,2006-10-27T03:39Z,is this torrent working??? cause after waiting so much time....i don't wanna have a surprise....and thx Shojin your awesome!
,1935_bomber,2006-10-27T09:06Z,Jesus christ MAKE IT WORK
,Antipika,2006-10-27T12:26Z,"Teh UPS dude just came at my home :p I'm ripping the ISO atm and i'll start seeding :o

(only got 60-80 KB/s by the way :X)"
,Trollhammer13,2006-10-27T13:49Z,"Getting 227kbps now guys, win!"
,Liekki,2006-10-27T14:06Z,"I would be happy if the people who have downloaded this would seed it. Unfortunately about 7 people who had it downloaded, left right after 30minutes and now there is zero seeds again.

It is interesting that people do not understand the basics of p2p systems and they are looking only their own intrests."
,goldanthrowolf,2006-10-27T16:44Z,"No shit Liekki.  I always let it seed for about an hour after I download something, that way, it gets going further.  

Generally, I download at night/when I sleep, so I don't gotta worra bout using my machinef or something else, or if there's 20+ seeders or something."
,casalmm,2006-10-27T17:08Z,"this stop in 32,5%... X("
,Rip-Saw,2006-10-27T17:12Z,"I started a new torrent 11 hours ago and am 76% done with it. Appreciate the thought, Shojin. And I'll keep seeding what little % I got off this one in case the other is broken or something."
,Kenshin_x,2006-10-27T18:47Z,can you post a link rip saw for the other torrent?
,eragon18,2006-10-29T18:55Z,"Well, would u guys stop complaining. I hope u r happy since I am now the only seeder. The guy who started it isnt uploading anymore.

I didnt even download it, I bought a copy and made an ISO for my brothers. Then I saw this, so I decided to help u guys along.

I seed when I am not playing my games online, or my parents r not working at home.

So plz be patient."
,Bean Bandit,2006-10-29T21:46Z,Come on peeps. Were at 78% and it's not moving. This thing better be worth it.
,eragon18,2006-10-30T03:32Z,"I love the PSO and this game I think is better. That is why I am willing to share my copy with u guys. If you ever do get on and see a force name Gandrake, say hi to me. I love to hear from you."
,eragon18,2006-10-30T03:34Z,"I forgot to mention, my dad's internet is a bit slow. For some reason it can only upload at a max of 60kb/s. I'll try to get my brother who can upload at like a max of 600kb/s to seed to. I just sent the game to him over my personal torrent."
,Kenshin_x,2006-10-30T05:37Z,alright thx man! 
,Shojin,2006-10-30T10:02Z,"Hey guys, the FTP only uploaded to about 68% but I stopped it to give better seeding kB/s, after there are more seeders with the torrent Ill start the FTP up again.  But I found out my upload speed is capped by my ISP, at 128 kB's (in good areas), and being that Im in a house with very old cabling (like the 80's) it explains that my max upload speed is only about 80-100 kb/s.  So, theres nothing I can really do about it, even with a new modem.  But seems like its almost done for some of you so it should pick up.  Enjoy and if you do sign on network mode, I'm Seiryoku, or Shojin.

Enjoy soon."
,willis1712,2006-10-30T10:42Z,"Hmm, not sure if other ppl are getting this, but, apparently there is corruption in one file. Anyone else have it?"
,willis1712,2006-10-30T11:24Z,"Ehh, disregard my previous post. installed on second try with no probs, although attempting to run game gives an error in moonspeak."
,Shojin,2006-10-30T12:44Z,"Weird, you shouldn't get any errors.  I was able to install and run just fine, maybe you can give a screenshot?  I believe you do need japanese fonts installed."
,Shojin,2006-10-30T12:54Z,"Make sure you run ""online.exe"" even if you want to play the story mode, other wise the game wont run."
,Shojin,2006-10-30T12:55Z,"But ya, I just installed and logged on to network mode. So the iso is just fine."
,eragon18,2006-10-30T16:05Z,"Also, just like me, I had to install the directx off the game file too even tho i had the latest already. Try that too."
,Shojin,2006-10-30T20:58Z,"did the error as for a dsc something 17 file?  I cant remember the exact name but I know it starts with d and has some l's in it, dxll_17 maybe, those are language files that you need from windows XP.  "
,Bean Bandit,2006-10-31T03:37Z,Well I dropped this one cause it wouldn't run properly. And this wasn't released by a grp.
,Marcus_nr1,2006-10-31T13:03Z,"it is some problems when im installing the game it pops up something and then it says to ignore or cancel so i cant install the game, plz help me!! "
,Anahita,2006-10-31T17:07Z,Um now story mode doesnt work. Does this mean I needed to keep the iso data after installing? hahaha :(
,Shojin,2006-10-31T19:47Z,hmm.... I really don't understand...  did you try installing this iso when directly mounted to the virtual drive via Daemeon? And did you install using autorun? It has to be installed of course..
,Shojin,2006-10-31T19:48Z,But I have run it just fine and its the same size as the actual disc.
,Shojin,2006-10-31T19:56Z,"Also, some foreign games wont work unless you install to the default directory, Id try that too.  But even installing to a folder SEGA2 worked for me... I think its on your end.  You're welcome to try recharged's group but I think if you're having problems with this one you will with theirs, unless UltraISO messes up making isos.  Also ISObuster said all the data was okay."
,Shojin,2006-10-31T19:57Z,"Oh right, one more thing.  Gameguard runs on both story and online mode, so make sure you have your online firewalls accepting it or turn them off.  Thats been a recent problem"
,Shojin,2006-10-31T20:02Z,"Last thing I can suggeset is viewing the support tech forums at phantasystaruniverse.com  Because Ive had 2 friends this has also worked for, and like I said isohunt said all data was readable.  and its the same size down to the kilobit of the actual disk.  "
,ixelion,2006-10-31T23:48Z,So If I start paying for a subscription will I be able to play using the pirated version or will I have to buy it?
,Shojin,2006-11-01T06:36Z,Nah you can play once you get a subscription
,Infected2005,2006-11-01T18:43Z,"Hi, i have a problem, i mounted the .iso with Daemon tool, the installation was successfull, but when i try story or network mode, i have an error : GAME HACK DETECTED, and then the game close. I didn't change any file. Someone can help me on that ? thkx"
,chrisgdog,2006-11-02T04:37Z,"2 Questions:
1. Where can i download ""Japaese Packs"" or w/e u need so that i can read stuff in english. 


2. I want like the english version so i can play with my friends who actually buy it from the stoor. Is this what im DLin now?"
,Shojin,2006-11-02T07:45Z,"1. This is in English

2. Yes, this is it

Weird, I never got that.  Try reinstalling, and turning firewalls off.  Has anyone else had this problem?  Make sure you install to a directory with nothing else in it.

,chrisgdog,2006-11-02T22:10Z,I would greatly appreciate it if you could leave your BIttorrent up over night so other people could DL it faster =-D
,sabarblatoe,2006-11-03T08:39Z,"Go here to sign up for a SEGA account and after that it will give u the option to sing up for online game play for PSU ($9.99 a month). After that, just use your sega account info that you just created to sign in to the game under the network option and then u can create a character and shit.

I have finished the download of this torrent and setup a network account and everything works perfect.  Just mount ISO, install game and directx and ur ready to go.  Just so u know though, they shut down the server on thursdays from 1am to 6am for maintenance.

I will be shutting down all my other seeded torrents and dedicating all my upload this one as much as i can for a while so everyone can get this because it f-ing rocks hard nuttz.  the game rocks and so does the torrent.  I check out a few other PSU torrents and they sucked.  Plus, other sites dont have as good of comments as TPB does.  The only problem with this torrent is the asshole Fucktwats that finish there download and leave without hanging around to seed for others.  This isnt fu"

I have never played WOW so I couldn?t tell ya.  But from what I have seen of it, it seems to be kinda like it as far as MMORPG but more futureistic."
,sabarblatoe,2006-11-04T12:56Z,"To jittweezy954:
The No.051 error is still a bit of a problem with some players but it doesn?t seem to have anything to do with the game being pirated.  One known cause of the Error, is interference due to one of McAfee Security Center's Drivers.  I suggest you either go in and set McAfee to allow this prog to run or for a quick fix, just to see if this is indeed the problem, turn McAfee off all together. If the prog runs after that then u can go in and set up McAfee to allow the program.  :NOTE: I would not suggest turning off Security software for programs you have not already scanned and are sure are safe."
,sabarblatoe,2006-11-04T12:58Z,"To Hylozoist:
Shit man?.that?s messed up. I have yet to here that one. If you burned the iso to disk and are attempting to install that way, I suggest trying these options.
1.First try shutting down as many programs that are running in the background as you can.  It sound like it might be a mem problem but I don?t know.  After that try installing again.
2.try mounting the iso in Nero Image Drive(that?s what I used and it worked great) or daemontools and installing like that.
3.If you still have the iso on Hard Drive, use winrar to unrar it(if u have winrar on your system, just right click on the iso and choose ?extract to (name of file)? and it will create a folder with all the files within it.  Then just go into the folder and run the setup.
4.If you burned the filed to disk and no longer have the iso file then go to ?my computer? and choose to ?explore? the contents of the disk with psu on it.  Try copying all of the files back to ur hard drive and install the same way you would in OPTION #3.
If none of these work?.shit?I'm sorry.  I will try to look into it and see if I can find anything.  It honestly sound to me like a problem with the computer rather than the game.  Good luck."
,sabarblatoe,2006-11-04T13:00Z,"To Lefka:
Defanatly gona need more information.  What error are you getting.  If what you mean is that when you run the game and the menu screen pops up (the one with, single player, network, options, bla bla bla) it closes when you click on either ""network"" or ""single Player"", all you need to do is install the Directx shit and you should be fine.  If this isn't the case, post more info and ill try to help the best I can."

As for not enough HD space, uh , check the directory has sufficent space?"

,Mayunosuke,2006-11-08T13:22Z,"My game works just fine and i just installed the game with Daemon tools. No crack or anything i dont need to mount iso file in daemon to play either. Havnt played online yet couse i dont have any money to pay for it. But this game rox its so damn fun.


I have a lvl 36 Female Beast in Extra mode with loads of diffrent weapons in diffrent elements and stuff. Story mode is really really fun to."
,Shojin,2006-11-08T22:52Z,"chrisdog, thats gamegard, turn off firewalls or make sure gameguard is allowed to go through.

Deathbringer, as for the boxes, it sounds like you dont have japanese fonts installed.  You need them installed, since the game is coded in japanese.
"
,Shojin,2006-11-08T22:55Z,"Also, you don't have to turn your OS to Japanese, just have japanese fonts supported.

Japanese Fonts Test:

?????

If that shows up as boxes to you, you don't have Japanese fonts installed and need to get them."
,Shojin,2006-11-08T22:58Z,"Meh, my bad, apparently the board doesnt support Japanese fonts.

,NeXuS.9983,2006-12-19T03:25Z,"For all of you people who can't run story mode.

Goto this site, may need to register don't remember.
http://broomop.com/forums/index.php

At the top of the page click ""Downloads"".
Then on the left side, click ""PSU PC"".

At this point you should be able to see all the files to date for PSU on the site. WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR IS THIS, ""Loader.rar"".

This bypasses the GameGuard so you can play story mode.

HOW TO ?

Install PSU, DO NOT UPDATE, unrar the ""Loader.rar"", copy the ""Loader.exe"" to main folder where the game .exes files are. Run the main shortcut to setup the game options. Now run the ""Loader.exe"" NOT THE MAIN SHORTCUT. This will bypass the GameGuard. And no you do not have to mount the image to play.

THIS ONLY WORKS ON A NON PATCHED INSTALL. FOR VERSION 1.0 ONLY.
It will launch story mode if patch but crashes after playing a bit (I my self have tested it).

P.S.
I have used this loader now for 5 days and still works great, no trouble what so ever. As for the Network mode, no it does not work. But to play online you just need to go to this site ""billing.playsega.com"" and get a SEGA account (free), and then a new subscription (Guardian's License). $10 for 30 days, 50$ for 180 days. Bonus days for new subscribers."

install the game,  then click on online.exe then open up network mode and click log in so that it patches, you dont need a user name or password. It takes a few minute to patch the game.

Once it's done, delete PsuOff and copy/paste Psu. afterwards rename the copied Psu to PsuOff and it will work.
