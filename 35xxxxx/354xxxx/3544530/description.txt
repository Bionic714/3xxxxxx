Michael Flatley ?Lord of the Dance?



Dancer, performer, musician. To the many millions of his fans in all corners of the world, Michael Flatley
is seen as a genius of his craft. From the most humble of beginnings, this most talented of stars is
responsible for bringing the mesmerizing magic of Irish dance to the international arena. As one of
the world's most graceful athletes, Michael has shaped the future of Irish dance.

Michael, an accomplished flautist as well as acclaimed dancer, is a master of performance and art:
his intoxicating mix of traditional music and dance, both old and new, has broken every
record in the book.

Together with the superbly choreographed precision-dancers, the intimidating set design and the
visual complexity of the dance, the sheer purity of Michael's presence has created thousands of loyal followers.

Since opening at 'The Point' in Dublin on 2nd July 1996, 'Lord Of the Dance' has enjoyed a vast
array of accolades. 'Lord Of The Dance' was the first concert of its kind to sell-out 21 shows at
one of Europe's best-known venues: London's Wembley Arena. The tour has also outsold all
other major shows across the globe and a total of four other simultaneous touring troupes
continue to break box office records in Japan, South Africa, Europe and the USA.

The 'Lord Of The Dance' video was the 1996 UK Christmas No.1, collecting a twelve times
Platinum sales award.
