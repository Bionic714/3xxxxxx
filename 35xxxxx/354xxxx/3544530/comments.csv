,lagavulin69,2006-10-28T12:51Z,"Thanks for a nice upload! 
I'm having some problems with both of these discs. I have burned the iso's with NERO but my DVD-player will not accept the discs! Anyone got an cloue why? Is this an unusual DVD-format, the file VIDEO_TS.VOB is not in the VIDEO_TS-folder. I usually don't have any problems what so ever! Thanks"

,fay,2007-02-08T22:19Z,"Hej
Jag har fått lite problem med iso-filen. VLC samt Nero Show Time vägrar att spela upp filmer. Jag har ännu ej bränt någon av de utan försöker spela upp filmer på dator. Kan någon förklara till mig vad och hur jag ska göra för att få de fungera?"
,fay,2007-02-08T22:19Z,"Och min dator visat filer som image-filer...
Help!"

,brice3011,2009-01-05T15:41Z,"This is NTSC! How do I convert this to PAL without going beyond one DVD per movie?
Burning this iso to dvd does not playback on my PAL player."
,brice3011,2009-01-05T16:07Z,"Found the solution! Extract the iso, do not burn (use PowerIso or Isobuster). Burn the extracted files with DVD Shrink 3.2. This dvd will play on a PAL player.

To Lagavulin69: next time post your solution instead of merely boasting you found it."
,Badmamajama141,2009-03-20T17:13Z,"I burned the ISO files to the 2 DVD's and they will only play on any computer. My 3 DVD players all say ""Cannot play this format."" Please help. I thought the format was NTSC??"

Tackar så mycket för UL..."
,Toekneedeezee,2009-12-12T03:18Z,So good. Riverdance NYC was my favourite of the two. 5/5
,grasssnake,2010-03-19T16:28Z,"For converting and burning, use AVI to DVD converter by Xilisoft (can get it from the bay)
Will convert to pal if you want.  Iv'e found very few formats that this little wonder won't handle!"

,VD_T001,2011-11-05T18:40Z,"Nice upload, thanks!
It will be just perfect for me after correction of tiny misprint in folder's names (Flat_L_ey)...
and it's still a riddle 4 me why is it necessary to put jpeg and txt in iso format? :)
Good work, after all."
