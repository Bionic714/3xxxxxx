Crossbow / The Adventures Of William Tell (1987 VHS)
Starring: Will Lyman, Jeremy Clyde, Robert Forster, Harry Carey Jr., Johnny Crawford
Directed by George Mihalka

From Yahoo! Movies:
Fourteenth century Europe, William Tell and his son Matthew are imprisoned by the tyrannical Gessler. As Governor of Austria, Gessler plans to stop the Swiss uprising. But there is no stopping William Tell\'s legendary strength and skill. 

This movie is based on the TV show with the same name that starred the same actors. That show is listed at http://imdb.com/title/tt0140731/

A DVD is available on Amazon.co.uk that has the first four episodes of that show (released January 2006). This movie has not been released in DVD form as far as I can tell.

VHS Capture, XVid, 512x384, 29.97 FPS, MP3 128 kbps, 95 min run time.
There are intermittent video artifacts around 80-85 min but they are brief and limited. I could not get around the original VHS tape\'s limitations.
