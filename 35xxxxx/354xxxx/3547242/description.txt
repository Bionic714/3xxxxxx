Tresor.180CD  |  Various Artists |  Annex 4

The majority of vinyl-only releases are naturally picked up by DJ\'s and collectors: heard often in the clubs but virtually unobtainable by non-vinyl junkies and fans who don\'t own turntables. This third installation of the CD-only \"Annex\" compilation series samples 2000 and 2001?s standout EP and album VINYL-ONLY tracks found among Tresor numbers 139 through 179. Appearing for the first time ever on CD format is Matthew Herbert\'s \"Housey Housey Mix\" of \"Mistakes\" that he recorded exclusively for Tresor. Tobias Schmidt\'s \"Hard & Heavy\" is taken from his EP ?Real Life? (Tresor.179) and the unreleased Drexciya track \"Digital Tsunami\" introduces the second Drexciya album on Tresor \"Harnessed the Storm\" (Tresor.181). You\'ll also find Ben Sims and Subhead from their twelve-inch debuts on Tresor and the Shufflemaster Remix of Sender Berlin\'s \"Zeitsignal\" - and this is not the only club hit you?ll find here. \"Annex 4\" is a collection for the home-listeners of high-quality electronic music and for all DJs who\'d like to have an inside hint about which Tresor tracks should definitely be part of their set.
