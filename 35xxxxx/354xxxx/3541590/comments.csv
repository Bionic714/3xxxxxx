,MrWise.dev,2006-10-19T01:33Z,But won't text and stuff in the game still be in german?
,Sanjurolol,2006-10-19T09:18Z,"Just go to ge.ini file and chance subtitles to english then go to your data folder and take out german speach pak and put in english speach pak, then rename speach_english.pak to speach_german.pak.
You will trick the game and will have fully english version."
,Picakus,2006-10-19T10:34Z,"If you need english subtitle download this http://www.gamershell.com/download_15929.shtml and change in ini like that 
VoiceLanguage=German
SubtitleLanguage=German

to

VoiceLanguage=English
SubtitleLanguage=English"
