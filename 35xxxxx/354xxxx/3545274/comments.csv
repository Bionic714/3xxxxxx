,East Lansing,2007-03-03T13:18Z,It's nice to have these as AVI files.  That way if you're putting together a DVD you can omit the weaker offerings.  This collection of cartoons is hit and miss.  Audio and video quality are excellent.
,dahulk12,2007-03-19T23:26Z,"I ripped this from my laserdisc into 1 huge file, then used virtualdubmod to split into episodes. I split the cartoons by keyframes, that way if you use something like ConvertXtoDVD and line up cartoons in the order they are listed, they should play as one file again, going from one cartoon seamlessly into the next.
