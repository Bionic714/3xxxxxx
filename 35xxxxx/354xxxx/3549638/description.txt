kurdistani movie about a famous battle between the kurdish freedom fighters and saddams army.
the picture quality is lousy and there are no english subtitles. the movie seems pretty cool though and has some realy interesting fx. 
a translation would be apreciated.
also tell me if you fid it on the imdb.
