,warpengi,2006-11-03T01:17Z,"Well you asked for comments...
While I believe the Kurds have a valid case for a homeland they are right now being used by the u.s. occupation of Iraq.  I expect they will find like so many others (Saddam is a good example) they have made deal with the devil.  You can't trust the americans and I  expect the experience will only end in grief for the kurds as they are betrayed like so many others.  It is hard to be sympathetic, though, as there are enough examples of this that they should know better."
,the_traveler,2006-11-22T21:09Z,"well i was hoping for a comment that was reated to the content of the movie rathertthan current politial situation. altough i agree your point that the kurds are used by the us and probably will be screwed by them in the end, the situation in the protected kurdistan region of northern iraq has definetly profited from us oparations, their economy infrastrukture and democratic process has progressed alot since the first gulf war, and isnow on a muh higher level then in the rest of the country.
anyway, doesent anyone have any comments on the moi itself? and plaese, all you kurdish speaking people out there, give us a translation!"
