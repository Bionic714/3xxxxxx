Tip to the Uploader: Please jump off most of your torrents and seed this one as one out of, let's say 2 or 3 torrents. Unless one has unlimited bandwidth, like the Swedes in here, never ever participate in more than said number of torrents; it will harm you and it will harm us as leechers and most likely people don't bother to stay on. A loose - loose situation; the opposite would of course be a win - win one...

Btw, uploader should also close his previous torrent of this one. Tip: look for the little red cross in the rightmost upper corner of the description section in the PREVIOUS one, not this one!

Good luck with your future torrents :-)"

It should say lose - lose situation..."

,kiwi33,2006-11-28T05:28Z,"For the record...as opposed to what many comments would indicate, this torrent is seeded and does download. I am yet to confirm if it requires a password to open. One comment suggests they got a BAD PASSKEY error, although the torrent description suggest no key is required."

If you need to see or copy programs from the (AIO) packs , do this .

1. Run the pack 
2. Write in andress bar
