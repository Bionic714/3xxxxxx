Use C-XboxTools instead, much better."

,elyk1212,2006-10-21T18:04Z,"AS the previous poster implied, this program is an xbox ISO utility.  A feature is FTP but it is not the main function (as the title and description of the torrent, state).  This works great for downsizing isos to DVD-5 format from the 7GB dual layer.  It takes repeated data and puts symbolic links all over the disc, thus conserving space.   I use it now and again for this reason.  

However, just use normal FTP for when it comes to transfering your ISO to the xbox.  It must be extracted first, however.  It is really easy, and if you don't know what I am talking about, look up FTP on google and do some research.  Most FREE FTP programs are built for people who can simply point and click.....  they are pretty easy"
