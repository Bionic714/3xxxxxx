,Stiffer,2006-10-19T05:21Z,"The game is Awesome, Cool... I LOVE it :D"

,KiNgSoFsOf,2006-10-23T20:52Z,wtf where is all seeders there is 0 seeder in this download
,Juar3z,2006-10-24T00:26Z,finally i have been looking for this game with a good dl speed thanx
,357sig,2006-10-26T00:44Z,"No Seeders? If some people would actually stick around a while after their downloads finish we wouldn't have these problems.
Selfish bitches!"
,amishbuggy,2006-10-26T02:30Z,"Well I would love to stick around and seed this download, but it appears that noone wants to keep the entire version up online so I can finish my own download.  But i'll continue to allow everyone else to leech from me what I have until my download does complete."
,tittygraahams,2006-10-26T06:46Z,whats the deal i'm stuck at 77.7% complete 
,Juar3z,2006-10-26T16:55Z,no offense but this is why ppl with crappy upload speeds dont upload
,amishbuggy,2006-10-26T20:40Z,"Well you all wouldn't be stuck at 77-78% if it weren't for the fact that I haven't gotten past 78%, since noone seems to be seeding who is past this point."
,c_los1519,2006-10-26T22:38Z,Stiffer plz seed!!
,Juar3z,2006-10-27T20:50Z,NOBODY DOWNLOAD THIS U WONT GET PASSED 78.0% COMPLETE

,spiritcatcher,2006-10-28T13:02Z,"seed, pleaze..it cant be  that hard can it? must it take a week for this to come in?"
,senhor,2006-10-28T13:59Z,"now, someone seed. stiffer, you said that you would seed, so SEED. I must wait 20:13:30 hours to get this game if you do not seed. I do not care who seeds, the main thing is that could someone who is not so asshole-bitch seed. thanks."

,Beleidat,2006-11-02T12:05Z,"She canna take much more captain....

Almost there lads, promise I wont stop it on 99.9"
,amishbuggy,2006-11-02T20:10Z,"I've been done this file finally for about 3 days, so I am also seeding 100% of the game and will leave it up for awhile.  I also have a great upload speed so you shouldn't have anymore problems with the speeds or getting stuck at 78%.

Enjoy"
,daneww,2006-11-03T15:55Z,Could you up the Uploading a bit please? I'm ganna be party'ing most of the time this weekend so will let it sit and seed with max on :) Enjoy every one. and thanks to the people  seeding .
,amishbuggy,2006-11-04T02:59Z,"Well man, I don't think I can crank the upload speed much higher, since it appears that the restriction right now is on the downloaders, I just watched my upload peg at about 1.2MB/s for a few minutes, so hopefully everyone's downloads will be done rather quickly compared to what mine was like."
,daneww,2006-11-04T11:03Z,I'm downloading with 10-30 kb/s. would really appreciate if some more people could crank it up :p
,daneww,2006-11-04T15:02Z,great game!
,amishbuggy,2006-11-04T17:56Z,"Yeah I've increased my allowed download connections to 50 instead of 10 and now I'm hitting on average 2+MB/s and total speed of around 6MB/s, although I'm beginning to not understand the difference between the 2 of these, but enjoy them anyhow."
