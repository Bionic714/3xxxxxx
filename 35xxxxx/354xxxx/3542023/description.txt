Sorry i dont got an NFO or somthing for this game.
But as i can say it is the BEST game ever.

You have SinglePlayer and MultiPlayer wich you play on.

You start as a FEAR member and comming into a house, where you will \"meet\" a girl.
The girl walks slowly against you as your char throws out of the window by a explosion...

You will see a little strange things and you surly will jump in your chair...
This is more like a frightening movie if you sit next to the one who plays it...
I jump high when i play it...even if i know what will happen....
