1: The file format is NRG, not standard ISO, and you need to be careful about converting to other formats (as needed by most emulators), since it seems to contain 'sub-channel' data. I used 'Alcohol' to convert it to CCD+SUB+IMG, which works fine with the ePSXe emulator.

2: Apparently this is the italian version, so you'll need some basic knowledge of this language to play the game."
