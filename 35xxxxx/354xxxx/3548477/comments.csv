Don't waste your time with this..."
,gunshark,2006-11-28T14:42Z,"Please seed, it stops at 36,3 % !!!"
,e_ntropy,2006-12-10T04:11Z,"I can't get the installer to work.  Granted, it may be a problem on my end.  However, it took 3 days to download as well.

,spiralgirl,2006-12-19T08:07Z,"Anyone have the authorization code for this?  I can't get the keygen to open up.
"
,Piazzolla1,2006-12-20T08:55Z,Anyone who can share the name and serial number for the installation process?
,creril,2006-12-25T21:40Z,The KeyGen is an .exe file if im not mistaken. an .exe file in Mac?! 
,leo_smith,2007-01-17T21:55Z,"hey guys, are there any seeders that can help me out?"
,ts3624,2007-02-22T21:14Z,"if you don't want to download bootcamp or virtual pc, just email keygen to a friend with a pc and get them to open it. problem solved."
,wadadliroo,2007-03-09T20:22Z,"? March 2007 ?  Can someone PLEASE CLARIFY if this works on Mac? Yes it is labeled for Mac but some of the comments are very misleading. Don't want to spend days D/L-ing if this ain't happnenin!.

If it IS good to go for Mac, please seed it. Thanks! :?)"
,wadadliroo,2007-03-13T01:43Z,"The good ratio on this torrent is slowly diminishing. What happened to hanging around to seed after you've grabbed what you wanted? C'mon folks, repeat after me: ""Seed now, seed often!"""
,wadadliroo,2007-03-13T21:39Z,That's better - thanks!
,Thegreenman,2007-03-17T13:42Z,Thank very muchas !

,dr.kablamo,2007-04-12T00:12Z,please seed
,halo37253,2007-04-20T04:41Z,this works great. yes the keygen is exe but most ppl have windows and their windows computer is probly faster then their macs like me who has a intel mac. but really im downloading this for osx86. 10.4.8 osx86 boots faster on my pc then it does on a real mac. and i have full support on pc. this works great expically when u have it on a computer you can easy switch os 2. my mac pro is in the basement next to my old windows xp computer. btw this starts up much faster on the pc can somebody tell my y. i though macs were fast. but i do have a really fast pc that boots windows faster then mac also. MAC RULES! VISTA RULES MORE!
,txyz415,2007-06-14T19:35Z,please help!!!  i'm a pirate bay virgin.......what do i use as the request code so i can generate a working authorization code??   thx a million!!!
,danike567,2007-06-19T09:03Z,I'm having the same problem as the above post.  Sorry for being a n00b but I don't know what to use as the Request Code in the Keygen to get an Authorization Code.  Anyhelp would be greatly appreciated.
,wolverine_matt,2007-06-27T03:53Z,I can confirm that this does work. If you don't have access to a pc then use CrossOver. For the request code in the keygen use the activation code in the activate by phone page.
,blamusicrob,2007-09-08T22:16Z,"Holy shit, this downloaded in less then an hour. Never had a torrent like this before.

Installs great, don't use the windows serial number generator, heres one that works from another pirate bay torrent:
1045-0436-9551-0266-5984-9386"
,blamusicrob,2007-09-08T22:20Z,"My mistake, you will be needing the windows based software :) The serial works but you need to activate."

,bonkeykong,2008-02-04T17:14Z,"I got it to work, here's what I did.
1. Enter in a serial number during installation, I used 1045-0436-9551-0266-5984-9386 .
2. When it's installed and it's time to activate, don't activate over the internet, choose activate by phone.
3. Enter in the code it gives you as the registration code in the keygen (I used CrossOver Mac to run in on OSX)
4. Generate a new code and enter it in manually to the activation program."

,PiratNerd,2008-10-04T09:20Z,I don't understand -do I really have to call that number to get an activation code? :S Isn't there a nother way?
,PiratNerd,2008-10-04T10:12Z,"and yeh, btw -when I call and click in all the numbers it's asking for, they say that their going to activate me. But after some minutes is sais they couldn't. :S I was calling from my mobile phone -if that makes any sence."
