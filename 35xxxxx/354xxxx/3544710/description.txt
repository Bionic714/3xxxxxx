How to see Aura: developing auric sight
In an effort to see the Aura we need to: 
 Increase the sensitivity of our eyes AND 
 Extend the range of perceived vibration beyond the visible light. 

It seems that we can accomplish the above by:


 Using and training our peripheral vision 
 Increasing exposure 
 Enhance visual sensation processing in the brain - enhance the communication between left and right hemispheres of the brain
