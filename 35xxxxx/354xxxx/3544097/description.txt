This version of Super Ad Blocker has been updated to now work with IE7.  The program and crack work fine - just be sure to read the instructions in the crack.  I scanned the crack with Kaspersky and Symantec anti-virus and didn\'t find any problems.  The download includes both the application and the crack.

Company Provided Synopsis:

Super Ad Blocker blocks all forms of advertising, including Flash ads, rich media, fly-ins, slide-ins, pop-ups, pop-unders, spyware and adware ads, and messenger ads. The program blocks major spyware applications, sponsored search-engine ads, and Gmail-sponsored links, and it includes advanced privacy cleaning and automatic updates, so the product is never outdated. Super Ad Blocker provides detailed statistics for the number and type of ads blocked. The application plays a fun sound when an ad is blocked to celebrate your victory. The scanner features a kernel level driver designed to help detect and remove \'rootkit\' style infections. The ad-blocking now blocks IntelliText ads that appear on web pages as double underlined words that show a window when hovered over.

Version 4.1.1004 provides updated ad-blocking and spyware defintions to detect and remove over 100,000 pests.
