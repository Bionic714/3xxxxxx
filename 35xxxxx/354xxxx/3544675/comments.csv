,P4p3Rc1iP,2006-10-24T00:13Z,"For some reason, the first time I tried this it didn't work (Nothing changed, couldn't play lan/solo). I put the origenal file back and edited it to match the cracked one. This gave me an error. I replaced it with the cracked one and it worked.

Kinda odd, but got it working now. Awesome game! :D"
,flonge,2006-10-24T01:56Z,"Is this really working!?

I cant believe it. Downloading!!!

ALL INN!!!"

,faryn,2006-10-24T06:20Z,Good point... hadn't thought of that. Thanks. :)
,theamazingrand0,2006-10-24T07:05Z,"Then after I apply the patch, how do I re-crack it? 2.7 normal only lets me play GPG online. Replacing the patched file from the .rar causes the game to crash before it even loads."

Same thing with this new crack, what gives? anyone  have any ideas?:("
,paradoxial,2006-10-24T07:57Z,"Just click multiplayer, then from there you can select lan. I'm using the new crack i posted in the comments..."

,P4p3Rc1iP,2006-10-24T09:19Z,"Like I said in my above post, I had that too.

I've been looking forward to this as i'm a huge TA fan, but they have a lot of work to do. The UI is horiffic, the AI builds up way too fast, unless my huge framerate issue is somehow related, and the whole flashy zoomy thing they have promoted only works for me for about 5 minutes before it starts to jolt in and out, again due to the FPS issues.

If they fix that, the AI and the UI then they'll have a good game but they got a lotta work to do in my opinion."

,HiroshiSakamoto,2006-10-25T06:16Z,"crispenigl, can you tell us the general specs of both computers? It's probably an incompatibility with either specific processor type or video card type. It'd be nice to know which computer runs it and which gets the GAL error."
,HiroshiSakamoto,2006-10-25T06:17Z,"Excuse the double post, but yes - my 2.7 patcher took ages to finish. It would zip through about 40% of the process and then take a 1/2 hour to do one file and then go quickly again, etc. I went to bed when it was at 80% and when I woke up the patcher was gone so I'm assuming it finished. It made no difference with my GAL Exception though. "
,crispenigl,2006-10-25T08:14Z,"Hiya,

gal exception error:

Both computers are dells, both have nvdia cards and both have 1 gb of ram, the older one is 2.4 ghz and the new one is 2.8 ghz..   There isnt much else different. 

I have tried complete reinstalls and tried playing the game uncracked and no luck - always a gal error.

on the computer that runs - i get a lot of weird polygon errors.  game is almost unplayeable actually."
,HiroshiSakamoto,2006-10-25T09:27Z,"I was finally able to see the GAL Exception window's message. It seems to be looking for Vertix Shader 2.0, which is a component of certain newe video cards. Chris Taylor said in an interview that Vertix and DirectX 10 won't be necessary but they will add to the graphics. I imagine this problem will be fixed as the range of hardware the game supports increases. But you never know, there might be some other fix for it. "

P.S. Everything works for me. Installed it(took some time)  patched it (this takes forever) and used new crack and everything is fine. Well exept framerate."
,Overlord123,2006-10-25T16:28Z,"@HiroshiSakamoto: Vertex Shader 2.0 is not part of DX10 but part of DX9, it's pretty basic stuff every newer graphics card has it.

,dude0421,2006-10-26T09:54Z,"Hi fellas.

I am using Beta 2.7 with the 2.7 crack.

The only game that works properly for me is the Skirmish mode with AI.

If i host a LAN game by myself and i am the only player in the game after a few seconds it says ""TIMEOUT!"" and i cant select or do anything in the game (hence restart).

Is there a trick to getting the Lan to work properly?  

Also, sometimes the game turns into a slide show (1-2 fps) after a few minutes of play with the AI (haven't tried with human players yet).  Although i did get a full 1.5 hour game working fairly well when i was playing the UEF on the 10x10 desert map... maybe some factions like the Aeon cause major lag due to their rendering..."
,dude0421,2006-10-26T10:04Z,Another thing...  Can anybody take screenshots (CTRL-F) without the game hanging?  
,Rosetttta,2006-10-26T15:58Z,"i cannot download the 2.7 crack from filefactory, the limit has been reached. Can anyone else post?"

,Keners,2006-10-27T14:58Z,"I believe the Aeon faction and shield generators lag the game, so try to avoid using them."

I haven't tried Lan with humans yet but it shouldn't slow down like it does against an AI opponent.

Another handy tip:  press ENTER and type /cam_free and press ENTER (this turns off the fixed camera mode).  

Also you can enable cheats before the game in the menu, and press CTRL-ALT-B for full mass and energy (keep pressing).

For some reason i can't fire the long range guns or nukes in sandbox mode... i haven't tried against human players.  hopefully it will work in other modes..."

Here is the .nfo file:

SUPREME COMMANDER HACK-MOD UPDATE BY MaDDoX for version .30

This is a quick update on EPSILON & CSEBAL's outstanding modding work. It contains the same button-enabling modifications plus a 3x faster screen-edge scrolling. You can use the skirmish AI after hosting a game on the official GPGnet servers, very useful to practice, test build orders and such. Apparently there were some engine changes for this version that prevent the LAN and Skirmish option to run on standalone mode, since the game now always tries to connect to GPGnet when you select those. Which in practice means you won't play it without an official cd-key, although you can watch .30 replays normally (double-clicking on a replay runs the game and plays it back immediately). Maybe the original mod coders can find a way around this limitation, I haven't found any."
,choakem,2006-11-14T11:28Z,Hey guys - I upgraded to V3 with a mate of mine and it seems that the LAN option does NOT work with hamachi anymore. I dont have a beta key so I cant comment as to the online but ONLINE is not an option anymore *SOB*. Don't worry I'm sure someone will relase a proper crack for v3 when they figure it out.
,choakem,2006-11-14T11:59Z,Just re-read what i wrote. No LAN play. Enuff said.
,Fozzibab,2006-11-14T22:00Z,"So is there any method of acquiring the 3.0 version of the beta OTHER than having an official key? I'm not so much worried about multiplay but skirmish mode in 2.7 (with the crack of course) plays great for about an hour. Once there are a couple hundred units on the screen however, even my system (which is like a tiny little god) slows down to 4-5 fps. "

,danmcn12,2007-01-06T00:48Z,Is this the FULL beta?  Kinda small
,cheatsforme,2007-01-06T03:30Z,those who want an updated version of this beta just downlaod the patches and install all up to 3.8  then use this crack http://www.gamereplays.org/community/index.php?act=Attach&type=post&id=169013 but hurry b4 it gets taken off the net i heard rumours they werent happy about people playing the game outside there box :( damm fileplanet closing the beta keys grrrrr
,Kurpitsa,2007-01-06T12:56Z,"I'm still confused, does the 3.8 work so that you can play against a skirmish AI or in LAN? It's just that i haven't downloaded the SC client yet, and i wouldn't want to waste bandwidth with something that won't work when i try to play it...

Thx in advance!"
,cheatsforme,2007-01-06T15:56Z,"the .38 crack unlocks Ai, skirmish and LAN play its the latest stable release all the patches after .38 i think took out LAN play"
,firerevenge,2007-01-06T23:52Z,"ehm when i try the .38 version i can use everything but nothing works. skirmish stays on 'connecting', multiplayer still requires a beta key. i hope someone can help me"
,firerevenge,2007-01-08T17:33Z,"nvm redownloading repaired it
