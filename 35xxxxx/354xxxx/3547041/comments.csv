Second thought:  i've just watched the first .vob, and it's friggin' AWEsome.  SUCH a good transfer.  you have no reason to be humble about this one, sir : )  sorry this is like a year after you upped it, but i just found it.  speaks to its quality that it's still being seeded.  and wtf?  no other comments?  c'mon people!  show your appreciation!"
