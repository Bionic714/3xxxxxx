I\\\\\\\'m not one to share official products, but when the official product gets it so wrong, you gotta help fix it.  This is just a straight MGM/UA LaserDisc played into a stand alone Panasonic DVD recorder.  The transfer looks good, but I\\\\\\\'m sure others can do better.  There is nothing but a text menu that leads into the movie.  \\\\\\\"Chapters\\\\\\\" are aprox. every 5 minutes.  There is a brief blank screen at the disc flip.  Compared to the DVD, there is more top and bottom to the picture on the screen.  Perfect transfer?  No, but a nice companion to the crop job of the DVD.
