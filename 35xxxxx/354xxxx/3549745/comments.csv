,odlumb,2007-12-19T19:37Z,"Port 6881 in, TCP and UDP, UDP return port # > 1024."
,thayk,2008-05-07T00:22Z,"wow, you have uploaded a forgotten treasure odlumb. the world would be grateful. does it have a spanish subtitle? or is it a spanish language with english subs?"
,PeterAichinger,2008-07-17T22:55Z,"Unfortunately anybody seeds the first version. Maybe you should make a note there to direct ppl. to this version.
(Naming this one 2 was a mistake in my opinion, ppl think this is part 2 and they want to get part 1 first.)"
,odlumb,2009-01-26T07:34Z,"I continue to seed, indefinitely but sometimes sporadically. Incoming port 50002, outgoing port >=1024."
,mtndweller,2010-06-17T03:59Z,"odlumb, Are you still seeding this torrent?  I'm new to this but have been searching for this film for a long time!  (unable to download)  Please help!"
,tspia,2011-11-16T20:31Z,"Your comments are intriguing, and I have been unable to find this movie anywhere else.  Would appreciate a seeder! With a smaller file perhaps?"
,tspia,2012-06-12T13:58Z,"I've been looking for this for years. Got 1/3 of it in 2011, but no activity at all for the past 6 months.  Am willing to keep in going if you will restart."
