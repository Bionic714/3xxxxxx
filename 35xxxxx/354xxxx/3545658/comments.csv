,Ilsa Bitch,2006-10-26T14:36Z,"Many thanks for the Hurriganes albums, but there is 2 missing songs on the album Rockin, song 5 and 7."
,Ilsa Bitch,2006-10-26T14:53Z,"Was to fast on the Enter button :) There should be 12 songs on Rockin album, not 10"
,Jykaman,2006-10-26T15:21Z,"
That's correct.

This has been ripped from CD (Fazer Finnlevy MCD 18) which contains the both albums.

Maybe there was not enough room to put all songs from Rockin' to this CD."
