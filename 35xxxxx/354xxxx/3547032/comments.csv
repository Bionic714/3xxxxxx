,jwb41465,2008-04-03T09:00Z,"Ruination of a generation! After first hearing TMB I began buying all of their albums, and then CDs. This particular compiled collection is one that I loaned out, but alas. the bloke went off to war and never returned, much less the CD set.
Ruination of a generation! The sum many hours spent at the turntable and having a floor covered with TMB's albums is astronomical. Before online life we listened to TMBs to the point of missing work and losing out on the world around. Yep, I blame the Ruination of our generation on too much time at the turntable listening to the Moody Blues (okay, floyd too).
Here on the eve of 60 years doing this life sentence the night was meant to be used designing a landscape for an estate - yet, here I have sat and listened to hours of blissful, insightful, music that ranges across the full spectrum of human emotions, aggressions, fears, and intuitions. Marvelsously ruined.
Thank you."
