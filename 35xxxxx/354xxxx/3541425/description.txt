These is a complete collection of the 25 applications featured in Novembre 2006 issue of MaximumPC.  Although several of the apps are available freely on the internet, I believe this collection is good and many will be pleased with them.  I included scans of the magazine because it gives a  good summary of the purpose of each program.  I have used many different software being a tech junkie and know the power the apps here have.  I am trying to share with the community and this is my first post, so please let me know if you like.  I can only seed for a while, so please someone help me.
