,masselito_81,2006-10-23T16:08Z,How do you burn the image from a PC so it can be worked on a mac
,anders_and,2006-10-23T19:50Z,sure you are seeding?
,foobaz,2006-10-23T20:48Z,"AFAIK, you can't burn these from anything except a Mac. I'll be seeding on and off, be patient and you'll eventually get it."
,Paddle,2006-10-26T01:52Z,Has anybody actually got this ? told to be patient ? how patient - been trying to doenlown for 4 days!!!@
,anders_and,2006-10-27T13:10Z,"nope, this doesn't work. Some server error, it says."
,wwortell,2006-11-03T13:45Z,"is the 4th disc essential for the installation? (for panther i only needed the 1st 2 of 4). 
Plz keep seeding!"
,socheat,2006-11-04T09:54Z,"Use Magic ISO to conver dmg to ISO, or burn dmb to CD by Magic ISO"
,Duo Maxwell,2006-11-08T16:53Z,This the PPC or x86 version?
,iaml8,2006-11-08T17:15Z,can you install this on a ordinary computer (non mac) ?
,foobaz,2006-11-11T01:04Z,"This is for ppc machines, not x86. It's 10.4.0; Apple didn't start shipping x86-compatible OS X until ( think) 10.4.4.

Depending on what you choose to install, you may not need the last disc or two.

Has anyone had any success burning these under Windows using Magic ISO, as socheat suggested?"
,scarabza,2006-11-12T13:04Z,Greetings all - can we get some seeders up for this... i'm desperate for this!!! :)
,slinger2g,2006-11-15T05:59Z,"PLEEEEEEEAAASE SEED!

,CrazyChris2,2006-12-02T05:27Z,"Hey all mac guys, I'm a long time windows guy... I wanted to know what PPC stands for... I will be getting a 500 mhz ibook and want to know if this will run.

,feuerloescher,2006-12-29T10:27Z,">> How do you burn the image from a PC
I burned dmg, as i usually do, with Transmac

Everything worked except for CD3
I could install only when i chose not to install items on CD3"
,feuerloescher,2006-12-29T10:31Z,"CrazyChris2
>> I will be getting a 500 mhz ibook

That's the same as mine

PPC stands for PowerPC (not Intel) processor

,ThreeDee,2007-01-04T02:03Z,"Again, you cannot install these in a PC! You MAY be able to find some program that can open/burn the files though."
,ThreeDee,2007-01-04T02:04Z,Come on people! SEED!!! Speed is 0.0KB/s! I'm seeding as much as I can!
,serggo,2007-01-14T10:12Z,"how to choose not to install items on cd3?

,ski647,2007-02-08T11:38Z,PLS SEED I need these 4 discs for an old Yosemite I'm up and looking
,coltonjared,2007-02-22T04:26Z,I downloaded disk 1 and 2 and I used disk copy to burn them as cd/dvd master image so when i try to boot off the disk 1 it gets to the grey apple and stays there. did i burn these wrong?
,unoxius,2007-03-03T01:17Z,"god dammit!!!
it was so fucking easy!
just download them.
open disc utility
click the .dmg file and burn them, one by one (I only did the first three because that was all i needed)
restart your computer and hold down ""alt"" (option)
then you get some proposals of start up discs if you cannot see your disc insert it and ejecty it a couple of times until it appears.
choose disc osx 10.4 when you see it and follow instructions!!!

Thank you FOOOOOOOBAZZZ!!!
LOVE YOU!

,spoofmymac,2007-03-03T03:51Z,"Okay well I got this and used transmac 7.0 to burn my CDs since I could not get them to work with toast. Started the install and disk one was fine. I only selected the options that require the first two disks. Disk 2 gives errors for ICAL, German, and will stop on Korean. I could not unselect the extra languages options, it just would not let me.  I am using a smurf G3 that had panther on it. I am now stuck in the dreaded loop and I am trying to download the second disk from another torrent."
,d00dz,2007-03-05T02:50Z,"quick question. all i have is a cd burner, is there a way i can install 10.4 without having to burn dvds?"
,Zapple,2007-03-09T22:54Z,"""quick question. all i have is a cd burner, is there a way i can install 10.4 without having to burn dvds?""

Yea, there are 5 files, which contain the disks. Each one is probably around 600 mb, which you can burn to a CD, not a DVD. :-) 

PS- You only need the first 2 disks, the other 2 are fonts/printer drivers (and I don't think they work) So when your installing, be sure to do a custom install and uncheck ""Fonts"""
,putosusio,2007-05-02T08:12Z,what's a seed and why do some people here want  other people to do it?
,lesderid,2007-05-28T06:10Z,works it with vmware? on a PC?
,binzerfied,2007-08-11T04:37Z,Could someone seed please?
,foobaz,2007-09-14T00:45Z,"senuxis: That's normal, it asks for the other discs after rebooting."
,bigreen,2007-10-08T18:23Z,"I downloaded this torrent on a pc and extracted the files to dmg, then wrote them to a cd. I then placed the cd into an Imac. All cd's mount on the Imac. Cd 1 will mount and when I open it I see the MacX icon and click to restart......after that nothing. I have tried booting up holding the ""c"" button down, gone under system preference to boot from the cd and even started the machine holding the ""option"" key down (only the hd shows). 
Anyone have any suggestions as to why the software will not install? I have downloaded two versions of Mac X tiger from this site.....neither has worked. I'm obviously missing a step. Can someone help me?"
,Apple_Master,2007-11-12T14:21Z,"I'm kind of in a bind with my iMac. Could we get a few more seeders for the day? It would be mighty awesome if I could get this downloaded today, instead of 6d 11h. :-)

Thx!
