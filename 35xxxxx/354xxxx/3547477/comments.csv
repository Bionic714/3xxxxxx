Really looking forward to experience this with a high end hi-fi / high quality headphones. Again, many thanks!"
,El Jafar,2006-10-29T09:55Z,"Everything recorded on a CD has losses. I'm not talking about the digitalisation process, because you can't hear that minor flaw. I'm talking about the distordation because they always record a CD with a way too high volume.  About all pikes above 2/3 of maximum are cut and it is all unneccessary!"
,El Jafar,2006-10-29T09:55Z,BTW thanks for uploading this!
,jaaper11,2007-10-17T09:13Z,hello. i was wondering if this could be seeded so that i may have a copy of these wonderful recordings. thank you very much.

,ToxicAcid,2009-03-12T15:09Z,"Thank you very much for sharing this wonderful set of CDs. Yet, the 5th CD is not complete - does anybody know where to get the 5th CD in lossless format? Thank you."

,Air_Wales,2010-01-31T14:43Z,"Great torrents! Thank you very much for sharing!

Can anyone tell me;

Thre are 5 tracks, and 6 locations (according to the booklet) at which the tracks are recorded at. Does anyone know what i'm hearing at each individual track?

Thanks!"
,EngineersAnon,2010-06-27T18:07Z,"If anyone's interested, the same thing is available in 192 kbps MP3s over at http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5651533 - except that I dl'd volume 5 from ponkassmonkey's link and converted it to MP3 instead of the reportedly corrupt FLAC on this torrent.

Just me seeding at the moment, but it looks like that'll be changing as quickly as I can get it uploaded to one of the 11 people already downloading it from me."
,dedutch,2010-08-29T15:52Z,"this is just the best torrent ever! my dad used to put this up b4 i went to sleep but i lost the cd.

thank you soooooo much!!!!"
,dedutch,2010-08-30T03:50Z,"oh and btw the fifth file is NOT corrupted, just use vlc as it has onboard .flac compatibility.

thanks again, slept like a baby with this stuff on my mp3 player!"
,sixe6erx,2011-10-19T01:36Z,Thank you so much for the upload. Will be seeding for a while so others may enjoy.
