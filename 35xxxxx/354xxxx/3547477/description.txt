	This is a collection of audio sensor data from the Voyager probe as it cruised out of our solar system. See the included pdf for details on what instruments recorded this. This comes from a 5 CD set from Laserlight that is no longer available. Each track is from one CD.

Enjoy the true sounds of space as interpreted by our crude instruments. The only thing missing is Bowman's heavy breathing.

Lossless, of course, for your enjoyment.

"Soundsfrom the interaction of the Solar Wind with the magnetosphere of Planets,Moons and Rings of Planets In Our Solar System"

"In 1990,  we made the Symphonies of the Planets series fromraw, uncataloged  space sounds data as a ?promotional? series.. Wedid not go through the lengthily process to document specific planets,moons or  rings. Rather we selected random information from the rawdata and processed it to produce Symphonies of the Planets. Howeverall sounds are ?Space Sounds?. There are no engine sounds from the spaceprobes.

Since that time we have catalogedand made 12 titles of specific planets, moons of planets and rings of planetswhich are included in this catalog.

This re-release of the 5 CD  (no cassettes available) Symphonies of the Planets series isnow packaged as a set which include a 6th CD titled Celestial Love Songs.Celestial Love Songs contains 4 minutes each of the cataloged ?Space Sounds?titles."
