,93knight,2010-06-24T13:19Z,"What a f'n joke.  Every time I expand this I get another Zipped file.  First it's a rar, then zip, then cpgz, then zip, then cpgz, etc,...  This continues on and on.  Is there some kind of special software other than the Archive Utility in Mac?"
,tryjs,2011-01-08T01:52Z,"Unrar, choose mitsubishi_engines.zip for engines or mitsubishi_transmissions.zip for transmissions. 
Open start.pdf.
That should work even on a Mac... :)
Enjoy!
