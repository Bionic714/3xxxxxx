,elin66,2006-10-22T20:30Z,Superb!! This is great like most of his songs..
,CaptSpaulding,2006-11-08T18:03Z,"Awsome, just awsome!"
,Renaldo,2006-12-11T16:12Z,"""The Rodeo Song"" is NOT by David. And unless someone renamed it, ""The Asshole Song"" isn't either. That leaves 8 of a total of 20 ""X-rated"" songs DAC recorded on 2 albums. You're better off getting a torrent with all the songs. Shouldn't be too hard to find; they've been seeded here before, too."
,Bu66er,2007-10-21T15:24Z,thanks for the up

[T],Dark_Swordsman,2008-03-01T17:14Z,"Die hard vinyl junkie here.
What are you using to rip, etc?
I have tons of vinyl, mostly 60's and 70's-
A lot of ultra rare stuff.....
Any help would be appreciated..
Cheers 



sorry i didnt get your message until now..i been job hunting..wel anyway i use Micrsoft digital media Edition because it is easier to name the tracks individually after their cut...But I also been using something called..Total Recorder....and if you have a Soundblaster card...the software for it has a recorder...you have to get one of those wires with an earphon type plug in one end and rca jack in other end connected from stereo and sound card....i want to see other people put vinyls on pirate bay...in my book..its not about stealing the stuff thats out there in CD now...its about restoring what the corporare entity wont put out in CD."

FLAC would be great, too.  Thanks for this."
