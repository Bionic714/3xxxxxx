,illitero,2006-10-28T05:05Z,You took off paint?!  FUCK YOU!
,arajav,2006-10-28T12:32Z,How should I do when it's an ISO???
,Jessi5589,2006-10-29T06:28Z,"Fuck you illitero.  You have no clue about anything.  Paint sucks anyways you loser.  Go fuck your hand or something you loser.  This actually is more stable than the regular version, you boner."
,illitero,2006-11-10T07:28Z,"Loser Loser Boner, haha.

I never doubted this version's instability.  I just thought it humorous and pointless to remove paint.  And I had to respond to his immediate command to ""fuck off"".  Don't you know how a conversation works?  And as far as you telling me to go fuck my hand, is that a tip from a pro such as yourself?"
,jsiii,2006-11-12T13:44Z,"I also think that removing Paint is any clever... anyway, is there any way how to uninstall all the crap that is provided with this bundle and re-enable some of the features that had been disabled?

These are items I hate to see in the list: Adobe Acrobat Reader 7.03, Codec and Filters, Diskeeper 10, DivX Converter 6.0, Fraunholfer IIS mp3 Codec, jetAudio 6, LimeWire pro 4.10.5, MSN Messenger 7.5 (patched), Winamp 5.24, BSplayer v1.38, Damn NFO viewer v2.10, Image Resizer, Nero v7.2.3 (silent install), Opera 9, Quick time, Real player, ResHacker, Xpize, Yahoo messenger 7.5, Disable Welcome Screen and uses Classic Logon, Disable Windows Time Service, Remove Language Bar"
,jsiii,2006-11-12T13:44Z,Correction: I also dont think that removing Paint is any clever
