,cageman021,2006-12-15T01:45Z,Does this version work on Mac?
,tolley1466,2007-05-08T18:51Z,does this need a key?
,ingenus,2007-07-16T12:21Z,"No, this one is not for Mac. 

You got all the keys included, so this is a complete and working version, since I use it when spinning music without any problems."
