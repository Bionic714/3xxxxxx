@YourNightmar3, fckng dumbass,
why do so many people use those crappy online virus checks, they don't work and they fck ur pc.
Just use your professional anti-virus software.

Trouble with this one is, it's detected because it can harm websites:P

@Devoney2,
I changed the hex coding somewhat, it know works better, it is no longer detected as a trojan by anti-virus.
Contact me for the new file;)

,hacker_cracker,2012-03-25T21:58Z,I just downloaded this and I downloaded those 2 files you said and put them in System32 folder. I am running Windows 7. Do you know what it might be?
