I mean, come on.. throw away Fuel, St Anger, The Unforgiven, and their lousy covers and put in songs like Hit the Lights, Battery, Fade to Black, And Justice for All etc...."
,Wilmuth,2006-10-26T22:40Z,"Totally agree!!

It should be a death penalty to call this a greatest hits from Metallica"
,Homerx81,2006-10-31T07:28Z,"hey, I think fuel and unforgiven are great songs that should go on a greatest hits album.  But I agree...there should always be studio versions only, no live stuff on something like this.  "
