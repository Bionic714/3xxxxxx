,madhouserevival,2006-12-02T07:20Z,"I have to give this game a flat zero. No A.I. whatsoever, if you die you start in the same position and the enemies are also in the same position and do exactly the same thing. The controls are terrible (no way to switch weapons quickly) and being forced to go to menu for every single action you want to take is just thoughtless of the designers.  No way to save your position, which I realize is common, but it makes you go through the same damn movies and speeched over and over and over until reach the checkpoint. This is a terrible release and it was massively hyped and the game sites have to be getting kickbacks from the game companies to rate this any higher than a 3 (I give that for the layout and scenary). Unless you have the absolute best PC system available you will be cringing at the sluggishness of this game."
,noclips,2006-12-03T11:13Z,how do you open a .7z file?
,noclips,2006-12-03T11:17Z,"nevermind, you need 7-zip:  http://www.7-zip.org/"
,karl500,2006-12-04T12:24Z,"You can also use ALZip(http://www.altools.net)
Anyway both 7-Zip & ALZip are freeware.
I use the 7-Zip format (.7z) because it offers stronger compression than Zip."
,karl500,2006-12-20T14:59Z,About the comments of madhouse: This game is great! You have to be blind to give it a flat zero. Concerning the controls it's true that it's a bit hectic in the beginning but you 'll get use it. GAMEPAD support would have been great. The A.I is ok. When  you die the enemies are not in the same position. This game runs very well on my pentium 4 & the graphics are wonderful with a Geforce 6600 GT. If you like tactical games you will love GRAW.
