,El Jafar,2007-03-11T21:26Z,"Do you have problem downloading this torrent? I have when using Bitcomet! The torrent was created with Bitcomet and it has worked before. The TPB staff recommend using utorrent or azureus. I've tested utorrent and it works.

What error message did I get? ""Error: Can not understand Tracker Protocol.""."
