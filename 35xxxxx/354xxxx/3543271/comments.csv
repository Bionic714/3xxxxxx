Respect."
,Jonascbc,2006-10-21T13:17Z,Is't very old? :D
,CocoaZ,2006-10-21T18:50Z,"As I recall, the game is from 1997. I did get it to work under Win XP but don't ask me how, I don't remember.

Hope you enjoy it anyways ^^"
,penol738,2006-10-21T20:07Z,"sweet, I remember playing the demo for this! You could try to run the game under Compatibility Mode in WinXP. Right-Click on the shortcut, and select Compatibility Mode for Win98 or Win95"
,testdump,2006-10-21T21:06Z,"It is possible to install and play this game in windows XP. All you have to do is dasable your Hardware Sound Acceleration in windows. To do this go to: Control Panel>Sounds and Audio Devices>Speaker Settings ""Advanced"" (at the bottom) Then go to tab {Performance} And Move the first slider ""Hardware Acceleration"" to the full left position.  After playing the game you just have to set this back, or don't whatever soundcard you are using. Good Luck. I can still highly recommend this one. allthough the looks are old, it has potential ^^   I think I'm going to search those disks again :-)"
,>Flanders<,2006-10-26T16:01Z,I have the same problem:(
,Str8hate,2006-10-27T14:30Z,"WHERE IS THE CRACK?!

""Sugar, Enter Disc 2 now""

Looked all over the web for a no-cd crack but no luck.

Anyone? "
,rectalragingfungus,2006-11-30T15:48Z,i cannot install it:-(
,thebadtouch,2006-12-23T22:24Z,Dosent anybody have Interstate '82?
,hunmatt,2006-12-27T17:27Z,"it didnt worked at me when I put sound acceleration to the very left side, but it worked when put with one scale to the right.

CD problem fix: rename your CD, DVD, virtual drive letter so that it will stay right after the last HardDisk. 

thx for seeding! i'm just finished )

,mrblah,2006-12-31T01:25Z,"Someone please seed, I lost my original play disc and I thought i was SOL. Now I find this...."
,fatso_ace,2007-01-20T19:43Z,Please seed! Thanks
,blaz3r,2007-01-25T02:58Z,hunmat that didn't do anything! how's that a cdfix?? why don't you elaborate more!
,Adarious,2007-06-19T07:58Z,"Seeding this for a bit ppl, have it fully downloaded.  This had been one of my favorite games.  Hopefully the added 60 kb/s is of help"
,Adarious,2007-06-19T11:59Z,"Ok ... first, both the sound fix and the compatibility setting for NT/XP are necessary.  Second, if you don't wish to mess around with drive letters, burn to cdr.  

I first tried Nero but it warned of overburn, so I downloaded magiciso and burned with it with no problem.  Not sure if anything is missing but I got it to run and made it to the point where you go to the 'wagon wheel'...blowing up 1 target before it crashed on an exception error.  Will retry a bit later."
,Adarious,2007-06-19T12:02Z,I don't spose anyone happens to have the Nitro pack expansion?
,cclark0330,2007-08-16T06:42Z,"I'm sorry everyone but I'm terribly new. The torrent  just finished and is now just 2 folders sitting on my computer. 

What do I do now? I can't open any of the files and am feeling quite dumb, any help?"
,las_chezz,2007-12-16T15:06Z,"Can someone please tell me in a simple wayhow 2 fix the problem ""Sugar, Enter Disc 2 now"" and i can fucking rename my harddrive it´s driving me fucking MAD!!!!

Is´nt there a crack or something??"
,zazquatch,2007-12-23T11:59Z,"Totally the best game ever.... Hello from Sweden btw. 

Back in the days where Voodoo GC was the shit. and I believe you got the game while buying a GC."
,gusIII,2008-01-02T16:16Z,Creepers on the radar!
,Vyzaroth,2008-05-23T14:13Z,"Get the funk outta ma' face! :D
Love this game, used to play it alot when i was a kid..."
,Dooffie,2008-06-28T22:32Z,Seed please!
,Trazan82,2008-09-03T01:35Z,"Cool, ages ago I played this. To get it working on XP, you need to inactivate the acceleration on your soundcard. Don´t ask me why."
,forbidden7687,2009-01-16T09:33Z,been trying to find this game a long time now... i got vista. is it compatible?? 
,whackyscoop,2009-04-13T06:14Z,"I used to roll this game hard, Just beat it today (on wimp). I'm currently seeding this as well as the nitro pack, and patch. If anyone wants to get some multi-melee going I'd definitely be interested.

""this aint right... this really aint right."""

,ascii_skunk,2010-06-27T18:51Z,Thankies!! This is the second game I ever played with a joystick (first one is MS Flight Simulator) :P wheeeeee 
,bocmaxima,2011-11-03T07:10Z,"Yo, haven't played this in... 11 years. Gonna seed."
,bocmaxima,2011-11-03T07:15Z,"I have a lot of good memories about this one. The atmosphere, the music... The fact that I could salvage scrap, fix it, and arm my car with it. The dialogs over CB radio."
