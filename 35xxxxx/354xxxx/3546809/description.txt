I don't think this has been out there yet.
Since it's a classic and all, I figured I'd give back to the community a little.

I don't like re-encoding movies that are around the 90 minute mark. However, seeing how the movie was encoded at a fairy high bitrate (and I can't seed a DVD9), I didn't really have a choice. I got rid of everything except for the movie, so it's at highest possible quality. I've included a 30s sample, so you can judge for yourself.

Enjoy, or don't, whatever...
