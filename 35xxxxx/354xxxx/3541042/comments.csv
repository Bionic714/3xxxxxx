The producers of the G.O.D.D.TM game making system are releasing the game Paparazi as a non-commercial public service and social comment. Because of the complete lack of killing in the game upon first blush one may be tempted to label the Paparazi as non-violent. We don't agree. The endless, eternal unrelenting pursuit by a mob of stalkers does not match our definition of non-violent. "
