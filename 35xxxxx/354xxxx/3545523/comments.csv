cheers."
,big111,2006-10-31T20:22Z,hmm cant get it to work...no crack file
,arsenic87,2006-11-01T14:36Z,"The crack is in the torrent.
When installing, just ignore the errors. Then apply the patch, and then apply the crack.
If it still doesn't work, delete the songs from 15 to 23 and the main theme in the songs directory and replace them with one of the other songs. I prefer song 13 ""Steaming"". Hehe.

,daf3k,2008-02-23T10:30Z,wat is an ISO file nd how to unzip it?
,kbterry,2008-04-14T22:06Z,please seed
,darkdaz,2008-05-22T13:33Z,"ok everyone listen up.

the crack is the long zip file in this torrent. read the nfo file when u extract the long zip file.

an iso is a cd image used by other programs like demon tools. and other burning or virtual drive programs,

if u want to extract the contents,  i would suggest getting magic iso, but if u have a virtual program already installed, mount the image onto the program and install that way...

and also ignore any errors as the uploader has already said about..

please everyone read readmes if theres any.
regards
darkdaz"

,imicah92,2011-03-11T07:29Z,"Just finished deleting this game and running several various virus and anti-malware tools. Thought I'd post this before restarting my comp... 
AUTORUN.EXE, AUTOSTART.EXE, TTT_DX.dll, and TTT_GL.dll are infected with trojans and were quarantined as soon as i mounted the .ISO image, and the TTT Menu.EXE launched some sort of malware.

Great Job... 0/10"
