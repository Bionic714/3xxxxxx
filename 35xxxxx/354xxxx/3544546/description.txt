Back with a bang, now! 
Do you remember in the summer 
Back in nineteen seventy-eight? 
When they reckoned that the skinhead\'s days were numbered 
And the papers dripped with liquid hate 
Being patriotic\'s not the fashion, so they said 
To fly your country\'s flags a crime 
Society tried it\'s best to kill you 
But the spirit lives until the end of time 

(Chorus) 
Back with a bang, now 
Back with the gang, now 
Back with a bang, now 
Back with the gang, now

Reckoned every skinhead was a bad man 
Enough to make an honest man be sick 
And they filled the papers with this rubbish every day 
Never missed a dirty little trick 

And still today they keep on lying 
Four years on and they still ain\'t learned 
That the skinhead way of life is getting stronger every day 
And we are never going to turn
