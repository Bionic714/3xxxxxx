This is definitely some funny shit. The voice actors behind the Simpsons talk about the show, and then get interviewed in character.

The very beginning of the show is cut off....sorry about that!

Nancy Cartwright as Bart Simpson and Nelson Muntz
Dan Castalanetta as Homer Simpson, Grandpa Simpson, Krusty the Clown, Barney and Mayor Quimby
Yeardley Smith as Lisa Simpson
Julie Kavner as Marge Simpson, Patty Bouvier and Selma Bouvier
Harry Shearer as Mr. Burns, Weyland Smithers, Principal Skinner and Ranier Wolfcastle
Hank Azaria as Moe Szyslak, Chief Wiggum and Apu

There are probably some other characters I'm forgetting! Enjoy!
