From Touch & Go Record site:
[quote]Two-thirds of Mule, Jim Kimball and Kevin Munro (formerly Kevin Strickland) were made up of ex-members of the Laughing Hyenas. The other third, a former member of Wig, P.W. Long (born Preston Cleveland), was a blood relative to the Hyenas front man, John Brannon (Negative Approach). 

Mule began in 1991 in Detroit. Like the Hyenas, Mule played swampy Southern tinged backwoods rock, but with somewhat more of an affinity for traditional country--?hillbilly punk,? if you will. From 1991-1996, they released two full lengths, one EP, and a handful of singles. ?Mule don?t give a damn about your political hang ups; but they?ll do wonders for your sex life.?[/quote]

This is a Mule 3 pack. I purchased these discs back in the mid 90\'s on the premise of the single \"We Know Your Drunk\" from the Wrung EP. As far as I know, these are the only 3 Mule albums available although a few singles are apparently out there. Its best descibed as a blues fused rock with some very interesting vocals. If your looking for some solid, unique backwoods Indie, then this is for you.
