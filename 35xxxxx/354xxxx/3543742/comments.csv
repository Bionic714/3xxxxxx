Thanks man!"
,vrathofdoom,2006-10-22T11:37Z,It´s really impossible to download this. And I always upload three times as much as I download...even more!
,fuzzyka,2006-10-22T13:33Z,"You can choose to download individual files within a torrent.  I downloaded this in the past but I only have episodes 5-14, I shall try and share these so hopefully that should take some load off FrankAlSmith's upload bandwidth."
,fuzzyka,2006-10-22T13:46Z,"Ok.  Uploading episodes 5-14 on this torrent.  I'm not seeding 1-4 as I no longer have them. 

Upload speed is set to 80kb/s."
,FrankAlSmith,2006-10-23T06:41Z,"If you do a search on Pirate Bay:
http://thepiratebay.org/search.php?q=sharpe
you'll see the individual episodes as well."
,vrathofdoom,2006-10-23T22:35Z,I´m a nice girl...I always seed more than double sie up. Sometimes seven or ten times as much...So please seed! I will do the same
,FrankAlSmith,2006-10-24T15:53Z,"I'm seeding, I'm seeding..."
,fuzzyka,2006-10-25T01:16Z,"Bloody hell, My torrent client is showing my ul/dl ratio as 1962:1 !!

I've uploaded 7.6gb on this torrent and downloaded  0mb so this doesn't seem right.

Still, it is seeding, even though i'm not seeding eps 1-4"
,vrathofdoom,2006-10-29T00:54Z,"I have over 70% downloaded. Please don´t stop seeding!
have a nice day."
,One2,2006-11-08T16:49Z,EXCELLENT tv-series this! Seen all episodes some 5-6 years back - highly recommended!
,redhammer,2006-11-20T15:03Z,"Seems to me they are already DivX.. so it would take just as much, if not more space, if you tryed downloading them separatly, perhaps not even getting all of them.. I am going for this one, I tryed the separate ones before and half of them didnt even download.."
,karumÃµmmi,2007-01-06T00:03Z,its not big but comes slow
,tt13,2007-01-25T02:37Z,"thanks FrankAlSmith and seeders. Great serie.  Came down slowly, took me a forthnight, at least.  Will continue to seed 10 of the episodes.  "
,Edzard,2007-01-29T20:28Z,"Downloading it now, hope it doesn't stop halfway :P"
,scannor,2007-03-04T19:17Z,This is shit. The sound is fucked up. Not worth to download.
,crusstee,2007-03-24T00:34Z,"HELP

scannor's comment scared me...I wanna watch these, but is the sound really that bad?

Is it worth my time/patience to download?  Will there be any seeds?  Shit!"
,ZZ_00_ZZ,2007-12-29T17:09Z,"Scannor, you are a shit. The sound is not bad at all, it's definitely watchable. "
,01eg,2008-02-10T23:27Z,seed please !!!!
,metaltomato,2008-05-03T15:01Z,"I have read all the Corwell books, and watched the first few tv shows when they aired.....great stuff, great big HONKING up!

thanks!

Having said that, please seed!"
,soundman42,2008-09-17T04:18Z,"9 gigs is nothing
thats 2 dvds worth
try downloading 150 gigs of mst3k

the download rate is fair at 20k
im only downloading 1 ep so i can evaluate quality
honestly i havent seen a sigle program in recent times where u cant select single files
4 years ago maybe but not now"
,soundman42,2008-09-18T20:35Z,"THERE SEEMS TO BE SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE EPISODE I SNAGGED
ahem indoor voice

hq video
no audio

strike that
out of the 6 video players i use only media player classic plays the audio

it also REFUSES to be converter to any other format  i e mp4 for ipod

it always hangs during conversion

so watchable but skrewy"
