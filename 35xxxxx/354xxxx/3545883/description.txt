This American Life - The Complete Archives Vol. 3 (1998)
uploaded by Reverend Mediocre

This is Volume 3 of a continuing series of releases with the aim of having the entire WBEZ This American Life archives available in MP3 format. Vol. 3 includes the 31 episodes comprising all episodes from 1997 of Ira Glass's popular program. These are pulled straight from the WBEZ streaming archives. 

If you like This American Life, and other public radio programs, SUPPORT PUBLIC RADIO! Give to National Public Radio, give to Public Radio International (who distributes This American Life), I make these available because I love the program and think that episodes should be more readily available to put on your personal listening device, but without support from listeners like you and I quality programming like This American Life is not possible.
