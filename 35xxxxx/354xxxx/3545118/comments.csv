,Ajzer,2009-12-04T03:48Z,"My Avast-scanner found a virus in Maxwell v101 crack.exe but that's nothing to worry about, it's a simple win32.adware that causes no real harm. However, people should try to find a different crack instead of using that one. Simply delete the file after unpacking and find a new one."
