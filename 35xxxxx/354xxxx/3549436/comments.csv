,PanzarPaw,2007-01-07T08:55Z,"this torrent is great, and so is the game!"
,Kcazick55,2007-02-07T23:49Z,Is this the GH2 versions of the songs? Or a collection of all the songs featured in GH2?
,RisenDevil96,2007-04-08T04:33Z,"Looks like a collection if you ask me, it goes by the Album Name not anything like ""Guitar Hero II"" so seems pretty individual to me."
,Sephy626,2007-04-09T04:30Z,"but it has none of the unlockable songs.
