latest devhook, you can find it over here at our PSPR Downloads Section 
(http://www.psprevolution.net/forum/index.php?h=0&pf=0&c=7)

I also realized that most of the people only own a 1GB Memory stick, so included in this 
game Pack is a ISO to CSO or DAX (if you don\'t know what it is read below) converter. 
This program will turn the ISO game into something smaller and more suitable for your 
memory stick. 

If you have any questions about the PSP software loading, or installing the game please look 
over at our PSPR Learning Section Guide Archie which has everything anyone can learn about the 
PSP!
