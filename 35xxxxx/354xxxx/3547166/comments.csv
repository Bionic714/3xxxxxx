,julius76,2006-10-28T14:38Z,Must be due to no compression - DVD9 format
,bigmike_100,2006-10-28T14:47Z,"Ok, so how do I do it the next time ?
I was using 1DVDCopy and DVD43.
Didn't see any possibility to do a any compression.

[V],Tribaltiger,2006-10-28T14:50Z,Don´t do anything. Let us who downloads the movie choose what to keep and which size we want.
,downloading king,2006-10-28T15:06Z,it contains 12 viruses
,Abstracta,2006-10-28T15:57Z,"As it's been said, don't do anything. Then we can remove subs and extras we don't need and then shrink the video, if needed, ourself. 

I wish more people did this. I hate it when someone keeps the extras and then have to shrink the video."

,fuzzydude,2006-11-03T00:08Z,"It's taking a long time to download this torrent. If the seeder would be so kind as to limit his/her number of upload slots to 1 or 2, this torrent would probably speed up alot."
,fuzzydude,2006-11-03T01:37Z,"If you deside to follow my advise on limiting your number of upload slots, please set minium upload rate to about one third of your upload bandwidth."
