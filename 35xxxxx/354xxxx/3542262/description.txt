Watch The Skies (2005)



WATCH THE SKIES! looks at the history of science fiction movies from the silent era all the way up to the present. The one-hour documentary will look at six different areas within the genre:
- Atomic Anxiety: During the 1950s, especially, atomic bombs were on everyone's mind, and that made the issue ripe for adaptation to film. Among the movies have used the atomic story angle are The Beat from 20,000 Fathoms, Godzilla: King of the Monsters, The Incredible Shrinking Man and even the low-budge Attack of the Killer Tomatoes.
- Rockets to the Moon: Space travel has been the subject of science fiction since Melies' A Trip to the Moon, which set off a tradition that would later include such movies as Rocket Ship XM, The Angry Red Planet and the classic Forbidden Planet.
- Mars (and Everything Else) Attacks: Beings from outer space had a horrible reputation for destruction in the movies for a long time, with such spine-tingling entries as The Thing (From Another World), Earth vs. The Flying Saucers, I Married a Monster from Outer Space, Invasion of the Body Snatchers andThe Blob, not to mention The War of the Worlds, both the George Pal original and the upcoming Spielberg remake.
- The Word from on High: Not all visitors to this planet have been malevolent. Beginning with Robert Wise's The Day the Earth Stood Still, aliens with a message of peace have been preaching to their lowly human counterparts. Even Spielberg's ET: The Extra Terrestrial had something to teach the world.
- Post-Apocalypse Now: With the threat of nuclear bombs, it would only make sense that post-apocalyptic visions would also become a staple of the science fiction genre, with such movies as The Omega Man, The Planet of the Apes and The Terminator movies.
- Escapes to the Future: Envisioning the future put Jules Verne and H.G. Wells on the map and continues to serve science fiction cinema with such classics as 2001: A Space Odyssey, Things To Come and Metropolis.
