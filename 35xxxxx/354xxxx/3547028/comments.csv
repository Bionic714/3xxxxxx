,Mr. Tranceaddict,2006-10-28T08:29Z,"Go to archive in Azureus and create torrent, announce URL: http://tracker.prq.to/announce, choose file or folder(file/folder and torrent in the same folder, that you have chosen to download your files from Pirate Bay).
Go to ""upload torrent"" for uploading your blue frog.
Doubleclick your torrent, and ""open"" for seeding and feeding us leachers."
