UK Channel 4 Documentary: The Madness of Boy George

There\\\'s something indomitable about Boy George. Maybe it\\\'s because he\\\'s unapologetic, funny, filthy and often astonishingly outspoken. For instance, I think it\\\'s fair to say he won\\\'t be on Madonna\\\'s Christmas card list if she happens to catch an extraordinary tirade he unleashes about her in this fly-on-the-wall documentary. Cameras follow Boy George in the weeks running up to what was to become an infamous five-day spell of community service picking up litter in New York. The punishment was imposed by a judge after a strange incident involving Boy George, an emergency call to his flat and drug allegations. The Madness of Boy George is horribly fascinating, even though it retreads old ground. But we catch up with George as he awaits his sentence and ends up street sweeping in the full glare of the world\\\'s media. He\\\'s as candid as you\\\'d expect - and as foul-mouthed and indiscreet.
