,TeamAmerica,2010-01-19T22:09Z,"Hey, I don't know why this torrent isn't being seeded...which really sucks.  But I am seeding this torrent:

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5292413

which has the TI-92, TI-85, TI-86, TI-83 and some other ROMs for use with Virtual TI.

Just in case you are sick of waiting for eternity for this torrent.

Cheers."
