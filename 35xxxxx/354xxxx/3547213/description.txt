Filmed exclusively by an Iraqi doctor, This World reveals the terrible 
conditions of a civilian emergency room in Baghdad Al Yarmouk Hospital 
is in the most dangerous area of Baghdad. 
Sectarian violence is tearing the city apart and ambulance crews go 
from one dangerous mission to another. 
Talking on camera is dangerous, but here patients and doctors speak out. 
Wherever they go, the doctor is there with his camera. 
"People don't know what is going on in Iraq," he says, "they can't hear 
the Iraqi people screaming." 
In the constant stream of news reports from Iraq, the voice of ordinary 
people seems to have been lost. 
In this film, we hear from them directly... and get a harrowing insight 
into everyday life in Baghdad.
