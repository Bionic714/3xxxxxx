,neuroleptika2,2009-08-06T22:50Z,"SUG MIN KUK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Nej....jag menar....can somebody please consider seeding? I will seed this after Im finished! Im on 70% right now and it´s going really slow/dead...I have waited to long on this :(
"
,neuroleptika2,2009-08-08T00:40Z,"Ok I have it now, but the names on all episodes are in the wrong order! The first episode is called ""Within"", and that is correct - the one after that should be called ""Without"" but instead it´s also called ""Within""...and after that all names are just wrong/scrambled. That kind of sucks because it makes me confused, I don´t know if Im watching the episodes in the right order!"
,c3k1,2009-08-17T11:41Z,"These are the same AVIs as the ones included in http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4210756/X-Files_Season_1-9.
Byte to byte match.
IMO the other ones were ""stolen"" from here."
,Kelvin0,2010-02-13T01:29Z,Thanks I have downloaded a whole bunch of these seasons. And this seems to be the only place to find them.
,MrSucubus,2010-08-21T15:16Z,"Anybody knows if there are romanian subtitles for this torent?

Stie cineva daca sint subtitrari in Romaneste pentru acest torrent?"
,aienment,2011-04-05T12:46Z,Great upload mate. Thnx alot.
,piratiinho,2011-04-24T13:01Z,"Thanks, you are the only uploader of The X-Files. BUT it is damn too slow! And why do you put your nickname on all the tags, that is boring."
,naughtytorrentboy,2011-05-02T10:46Z,"Hi. I've been downloading this for 2 weeks now. Initially it was super fast up to %73, but clearly nobody is seeding the complete torrent any more.
PLEASE SEED so I can finish the download! I always upload X2(minimum) :o)"
,piratiinho,2011-05-05T16:39Z,"I DO NOT RECOMMAND THIS TORRENT
There is practically no one seeding."
,naughtytorrentboy,2011-05-09T11:18Z,I agree piratinho. I am in the same boat as you. I'm seeding bt only have 73%. If you have the complete file please seed!
,stgri,2012-03-18T05:19Z,please seed
