I do know because I deal with stats for a living: there is NO mathematical system to beat roulette in the long run, unless you would be very sure you are playing a biased wheel (= not all chances are perfectly equal due to a technical flaw).

As a matter of fact I read through another ""guide"" (I bet it's the same system), and sure enough, at every turn there is a great chance to win, but in the long run you will lose sooner or later because the house has an edge, and each time you lose you will lose more than you have already won (on average, of course, and that's all that matters in statistics). I even laid it out nicely in an OpenOffice document, mainly for my own fun. The only way this system will work is with an infinite amount of money and a finite amount of time."
