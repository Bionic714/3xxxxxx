,borgsta,2006-10-29T10:48Z,"Can this install from scratch?

I notice the file is 3.72 GB, does that mean there is several smaller files included?

Is there a file to put on CD so we can install it from the CD?

Thanks for any info."
,extreme69,2006-10-29T16:17Z,You can put this into your dvd rom and install all the appz by exploring the dvd and clicking on WPI.hta or set bios to boot from cdrom and do a fresh install.This does not upgrade.Yes you can do a full fresh install and after windows installs the WPI pops up pick your software and hit the install button and away you go.
,extreme69,2006-10-30T12:51Z,For any other info just go to www.extremebetas.com and post in the WPI unattended section and I'll answer your questions best I can.
