,richidpraah,2007-04-16T12:34Z,"i would just advise people against uncritically praising people like andrew cohen and ken wilber, both of whom there are serious issues about. especially cohen has an awesome misconscrewed notion of 'ego' and how to 'rid it' - wilber is just morphing more and more into a totalitarian nut, in spite of his undoubedly brilliant anal abilities with typography and systems.. on matters such as buddhism, taosim, hinduism, spirituality, nondualism, transpersonal psychology, ect. where it's at for me is with people such as alan watts, joseph campbell, carl jung, stanislav grof to mention a few that are not guru-nuts (read the book on cohen ""enlightenment blues"") or sports-spiritualists and über-achievers like wilber (he's really developing into quite a problem, i think!) just a tip!"
,donniwaha,2007-07-11T15:17Z,"This torrent contains a lot of video's and audiofiles that are really interessing if modern-day spiritualtity is what you're interested in. Of course there's a lot of discussion in this field - and we don't need some well-meaning advice not to read this guy or listen to that woman because they would have opinions and views different from richidpraad lofty insights. I'm very glad Schopenhauer (not family, i suppose ?) has seeded this torrent and will seed this myself for a long time. No hit and run people ! Sharing is the way to Good Karma."
,BuddhaSearch,2008-01-10T02:57Z,"This is a great torrent and I am enjoying the content very much.

However:

'Michael Beckwith with Andrew Cohen - Pt2, Is God Evolving, A Conversation About the Creative Principle.wmv'

is actually a duplicate of part 1 of this series of three.  Pity.  If anyone has the real one could they sling on out.

In any case highly recommended torrent."
,cheqwe,2008-02-27T16:07Z,"thanks schopenhauer. i was sure that you died few centuries ago! its nice to know that you are still around! thanks for introducing  wie to me. i havent make it through whole material yet, but what ive seen thats really great. im at stage that i want to publish few things from here! so... u gonna get spiral dinamics in serbian"
,crudjunction,2008-04-26T10:33Z,this is pseudoscientific nonsense and no one should take it seriously. 
,MaureenCaudill,2008-09-02T01:30Z,"I just started downloading but I feel obligated to comment(NO, not in the sense that I don't want to do it...didn't I see that in some movie with Tim Allen? Jungle Boy or sth like that...)anyway...really appreciate the contribution. :) Thanks a bunch."
