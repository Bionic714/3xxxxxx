,Pauper,2006-10-31T18:34Z,"DVDIdle Pro combines both functionality of DVD Region+CSS Free and DVDIdle into one efficient software!

DVD Region+CSS Free enables you to watch and copy any region-coded/CSS-encrypted DVD movies on any DVD drive! It fully supports region-protected (RPC2) DVD drives, and does not require any firmware modifications. It will even work if you have used up your region counter and can no longer change the DVD drive's region.

DVD Region+CSS Free works automatically in the background to make a DVD appear region code free and unprotected to any DVD player and DVD copy software. With the help of DVD Region+CSS Free, you can watch any region coded DVD movies with a software DVD player like PowerDVD or WinDVD! With DVD Region+CSS Free's help, DVD copy software (such as DVDFab, DVD X Copy, InterVideo DVD Copy, etc.) is able to copy DVD's which are CSS protected!

New Feature: DVD Region+CSS Free not only decrypts DVD's, it now also allows you to play, copy and rip protected Audio CD's!

DVDIdle helps you to extend the lifetime of your DVD drive. By using the Smart Read-ahead Cache, DVDIdle saves DVD data which will be played soon onto the hard disk cache or RAM cache, and then feeds it to DVD player. This allows the DVD drive to rest. For example: a 6X-speed DVD drive will only work for 15 minutes when you are watching a 90 minutes DVD movie.

DVDIdle works in the background, automatically caching the output of your software DVD player. With DVDIdle's help, a software DVD player like PowerDVD or WinDVD is able to provide smooth DVD playback while the DVD drive is sleeping!

New Features: DVDIdle now supports normal files, which means AVI, DivX, RM, ASF, WMV, MPG, MPEG, and DAT of VCD, SVCD files can be cached when you watch them from CD/DVD disc."
