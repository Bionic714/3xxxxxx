,SchwaWarrior,2008-04-02T07:17Z,"Um... I'm kinda new to torrents in general, so excuse my n00biness. I've downloaded this torrent in Azureus, but it says ""time = infinity"", and from what I gather that has something to do with seeders and leechers, neither of which this torrent has... Could someone possibly explain the problem and/or help me out? Thanks much. ^_^"
