The Tale of the Warlock
A tale about a man, who?s name seems to be forgotten. He is rembered as the Warlock.
After a very long period of absence, the Warlock is returning to his place of birth. When he left it many years ago to improve his skills as warlock, wizard and druid, this place was filled with peace and harmony. But during his absence, the evil Wizard of the Dark has taken over all control and power. Soon after the return of the Warlock, he meets the wise and beautiful young Princess. They fall in love, and everything seems heading towards a peaceful and very happy future . But then, one night a Storyteller is visiting the Warlock and tells him some myths and legends. It becomes clear by this stories that it is written in the stars that he must face the Wizard of the Dark. He accepts this challenge, and is then heading towards the Forbidden Citadel, where the Wizard of the Dark lives.
There is a confrontation between Warlock and the Wizard of the Dark. Although Warlock wins this battle, he returns home to his castle seriously injured, and will not recover again. After some days, fighting for his life, he dies in the arms of the Young Princess..

?The Tale Of The Warlock? is Gert Emmens? first concept album. It tells the fictional story about the lives and times of a magician and druid. We could already taste from it through a shorter version of the track ?The Warlock Returns? on the compilation-album ?Kinections-The Progday Support CD? and that was very promising. 

The Dutchman is a master in creating traditional electronic New Age music with a melodical edge. This is not different on ?The Tale Of The Warlock?. Stronger: it has become his most consistent and harmonically album yet and certainly the one that breaths most warmth. What?s very strong again are the sequences. This, combined with nice solos, wonderful atmospheric sounds en ingenious rhythms, makes this album an extremely enjoyable ride again. Gert?s collaborations with sequencer specialist Ruud Heij certainly have left traces on this album. Excellent is a piece like ?Myths And Legends As Told By The Storyteller?, that opens with atmospheric sounds and Mellotron choirs, after which great sequences are added and Emmens plays a soft solo. The following ?The Dream That Came True? is really something completely different: this short piece is played fully on the impressive Yamaha CS80-synthesizer, what immediately remembers of Vangelis. The highlight is perhaps ?Ghosts Calling From Yonder?, in which the sequences almost reach Klaus Schulze-like proportions. 

Gert continues to grow in his music and that is always a great thing for a musician.
