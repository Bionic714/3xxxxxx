,bobthebigbat,2007-01-15T10:22Z,Tried uploading to the xbox hdd but the game doesn't work. Used Enigmah to try both PAL and NTSC. Tried PAL-60 and non PAL-60. Nothing worked. Couldn't find a patch for the game either. Waste of time downloading.
,bobthebigbat,2007-01-15T11:06Z,"Update to my last post...
The game does work - you need to burn it to DVD and then you can use DVD2XBOX (I used DVD2Xbox07_8). Plays fine off DVD and Hard Drive."
