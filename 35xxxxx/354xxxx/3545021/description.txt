As Michael Schumacher retires from Formula 1, UK ITV Sport broadcast this half hour programme dedicated to \\\'The Greatest Driver of F1 Of All Time!\\\', Michael Schumacher.

As a McLaren Mercedes follower,I may not have always been a fan of his, but his all round performance as a F1 driver, and his 100% commitment cannot be disputed by anyone!!

Smashing all previous world records set by Fangio, Senna and the like.. He bows out and leaves the record books securely in place! 

A Half hour programme narrated by the original \\\'Voice of F1\\\' Murray Walker. Ive uploaded this for those who may have missed it on Monday night!!

Im sure we\\\'ll see him again in some support or management role back at Ferrari in the near future!!

On Behalf of all F1 fans, Enjoy This final look at one the all time greats!!

I have also uploaded the final F1 GP in Brazil, for those who are interested.
