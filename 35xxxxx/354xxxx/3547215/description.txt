From the Web:
One of the best and most influential bands of the 1980s, the Pixies broke up in 1992, seemingly for good. Though only together for about six years (and five albums), the Pixies earned themselves a passionately devoted fan base and became a major influence on artists ranging from David Bowie to U2 to Nirvana. Their mixture of punk, pop, and surf-rock was melodic, catchy, and set to lead singer Black Francis's oddball lyrics often both bizarre and innovative. In 2004 they reunited to play triumphant and quickly legendary comeback concerts all over the world, often in front of significantly larger and more appreciative crowds than they'd ever attracted in their first incarnation. Francis (also known as Frank Black), Kim Deal, Joey Santiago, and David Lovering hadn't missed a step since the release of the Pixie's last album, TROMPE LE MONDE, in 1991. This concert footage features excellent live renditions of some of the Pixies' best work, including "Bone Machine," "Velouria," "Where Is My Mind," "Gigantic," "Here Comes Your Man," and "Monkey Gone to Heaven." 

This DVD's main section encompasses 27 songs from the band's concert in Belfort, France; the nine bonus songs are culled from performances all over the world, from Austin, Texas, to Fuji Rock, Japan.

This is a necessity for any Pixies fan, even a growing fan. Based on quality alone this DVD is completely worth every second of recording and will be indelibly etched into my consciousness as the band itself is carved into the culture of music.
