,fanapathy,2006-10-16T21:01Z,"You need a so called torrent client to download the file. This is easy. There are several available, but I would recomment ""uTorrent"", ""azureus"" or ""BitComet"". Just search for it on google.com to find a place to download the client. Install it and follow instructions. Now you can download torrents via PirateBay and other sites. Good luck!"
