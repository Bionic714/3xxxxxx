,LunarKaos,2009-04-24T11:58Z,"SEED PLZ SEED PLZ..... ppl that say that r annoying. alot of seeders r helpfull with seeding at a 1/1 ratio. with this, since ppl stop seeding after the download, its gonna go slow. but look at leechers, theyre leeching, and not giving anything back. theyre point? they 'think' it makes the d/l go faster, but it doesnt. also, ppl that do seed, seed at a 1/1.5 to 1/3 d/u ratio because the d/l is slow. currently ive seeded 14 gigs, and i get a disk a day. if u need more then that, get a life, seriously. ur pirating a season thats $20 at HMV, y should any1 get a 5 hour d/l on this? im gonna be buying this season once i get paid, but its not like i'll die without it. if ur too cheap to buy this, then stop d/ling and get a life.... jeez ppl r annoying"

Stie cineva daca sint subtitrari in Romaneste pentru acest torrent?"

,Goatse64,2011-04-24T20:49Z,"We have enough seeds, it's just some people are being niggers and won't upload while they download.  I'm uploading 200kbs/second and downloading 15/second.  Seriously guys?  The more you upload to me, the more I can upload to you."
,analu,2011-11-03T23:45Z,"Thank you so much, Velhinhocego!
Obrigada!

I always seed from the start of the download.

I've seeded the X-Files first  6 seasons' uploads from Velhinhocego up to a 1/1 ratio and promisse I'll do the same when I'm finished with this 7th series upload.

Thanx to everyone who's seeding now. 
I don't mind if it's slow, since I know I'll have the whole series with good quality to watch in very few days. That's all that matters to me. "
,mojowoikin,2012-04-21T18:29Z,"Thanks VELHINHOCEGO, I appreciate you taking the time to upload this, and start the seeding.
DL started slow 8 to 20 Kbps, now I'm averaging about 40 to 50 Kbps. Pirate Bay should start doing the same as EU torrents - you need to register for an account, then if your total UL sharing contribution  drops below 10% of your DL, you are not able to DL until you bring it up again. If you're not uploading files - which I am not - then seeding is your contribution to the community. Seed to at least  1 to 1 ratio. C'mon people, without this it is not a file sharing site. A simple thank you to the uploader is also not too much to ask. A 5 year old file and 14 comments???? It's become like fucking kindergarten here. "
