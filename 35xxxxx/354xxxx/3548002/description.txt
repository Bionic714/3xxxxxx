Verizon has disabled features on the Motorola v325 such as the USB file transfer so you cant get pics off your phone or add ring tones.
They also took off the Vibrate THEN Ring feature.
Use these tools & get it all back 
All this info is on the web I just compiled & condensed it to a much simpler way.
