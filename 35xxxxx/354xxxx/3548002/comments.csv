,burn1,2008-04-21T13:40Z,"BITPIM.ORG is a program that allows you to view and manipulate data on many CDMA phones from LG, Samsung, Sanyo and other manufacturers. This includes the PhoneBook, Calendar, WallPapers, RingTones (functionality varies by phone) and the Filesystem for most Qualcomm CDMA chipset based phones. To see when phones will be supported, which ones are already supported and which features are supported, see online help. 

What phones do the developers have?
These phones are the best supported by BitPim as the developers have them. We appreciate phone loans. 

Phones that are listed here, but not in the list of supported phones are still being worked on. How to get phonespecs 

Manufacturer  Model  Notes  
Audiovox  CDM8900  Kindly loaned by RPI Wireless. Unfortunately the internal software on this phone proved to be too fragile and the phone is not supported by BitPim. The phone is also bricked after having been replaced 3 times in prior brickings!
