Tune in to CHMR(93.5 fm) Sundays from 10-1am for Apocalyptic Raids. Three hours of Crust, Grind, Power Violence, Thrash, H/C, Black Metal, NWOBHM, Crossover, Folk, and Punk Rock

Seeing as halloween is only  a few days away I\\\'m dedicating my whole show this week to the unholiest of nights.

This week I\\\'ll be playing Halloween favorites from:
The Devil\\\'s Whorehouse-Horror Punk side project started by a couple of dudes in Marduk
45 Grave-Spooky Punk Rockers
Lon Chaney, Jr-Son of horrors greatest actor
Diamonda Galas-The scariest woman in the world
Screaming Lord Sutch & The Savages-The original horror rockers
Deathcharge-Gloomy H/C
King Diamond-His satanic majesty
The Jacksons-Michael and his bros & some break dancing skeletons
Gang Green-Boston thrashers

I\\\'ll also be playing a live Samhain show from 1985.
I ripped the audio from a Samhain video I downloaded.
It has a few problems(like the sound peeking out), but the performance is solid.
This would be from just before the Unholy Passion ep came out.
Samhain is my favorite of Danzig\\\'s bands. This live show is a good example of why.
