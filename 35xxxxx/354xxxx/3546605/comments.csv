,mig65,2006-10-27T17:58Z,it works on anny BMW with navi ?
,thspimpolds,2006-10-27T23:16Z,"no, not any BMW, there are 2 types of navi's.  Check yours, this is for CCC only.


Correct no serials or such"
,peterpans,2006-10-28T16:58Z,"USA or Europe maps?
Tnx."
,thspimpolds,2006-10-29T00:33Z,USA
,peterpans,2006-10-29T02:22Z,"So why new torrent for 2007.1 USA maps?
There are already two torrents, also compressed with RAR (2,4GB instead 4,3GB) and are available since September 10."
,thspimpolds,2006-10-29T02:16Z,"i did this for a friend, i was told they were not CCC, they were the other version."
,peterpans,2006-10-29T10:41Z,"Yes, my mistake, you are right: they are ""high"" version.
Sorry for my bad company and thanks for your work.
Any chance to find Europe 2007.1?"
,peterpans,2006-10-29T10:42Z,"Ops... I mean ""sorry for my bad comment""..... :-O"

(simultaneously hold mute + CD eject + DVD eject until system turns off and restarts)."
,studio1b,2008-05-21T19:43Z,"to restart the GPS you need to turn off the car and then turn it back on. thats all after that the disc will load.

** when you turn the car off wait from 30 secs to 1 min before turning back on"
