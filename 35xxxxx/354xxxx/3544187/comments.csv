,urtehsuxx0rz,2006-10-25T17:36Z,"MANY thanks for this! This is probably the funniest but most offensive ATHF ever, with the possible exception of Slave Carl (aka Deleted Scenes) which was possibly more offensive but not nearly as funny.

I don't know how Cartoon Network let them broadcast this, but clearly the rainbow coloring on the phalluses was some kind of response to the Standards group..."
,somoney24,2007-10-04T15:56Z,awesome thank you...i have been tryng to get these episodes for months....handbanana worked great im sure this will too....thank you
,RakaDisciple,2008-08-24T10:56Z,well... thanks for the up... i can easily say this is the stupidest episode of ATHF. i have literally been a huge fan since episode one. i own the four seasons and have memorized them all. and sumhow season five has destroyed everything i ever loved about them. i barely even chuckled at any of the terrible episodes this season. i really sincerely hope they make a 6th season but i hope they get back whatever they lost...
