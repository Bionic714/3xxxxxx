,parlyzone,2006-11-03T19:52Z,"Plus 44... Nice!

Mark Hoppus and Travis Barker from Blink 182 making music together again, it's great (with their friends Craig and Shane, both on guitar)!

The sound is not far from Blink 182 or Boxcar Racer.."
,Svedberg,2006-11-06T14:08Z,Underbart!!! Väntat länge på denna. Travis e grym! Älskar honom på trummorna!
