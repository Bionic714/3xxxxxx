,brice3011,2009-01-06T10:06Z,"Fantastic show!! Kids and adults will love it.
To get on dvd: unpack iso (don't burn it with nero or alcohol120), and burn with dvd shrink 3.2

I burned the iso with nero but it did not read on my PAL player.
Burning the files instead of the image works."

,Sneb_Goupter,2009-05-30T11:43Z,"Hi... Just a wee note to say thanks, works a treat. I conld'nt get DVD shrink to burn Gold but nero work, then nero won't burn Celtic tiger but DVD shrink did. 
So just try them to see what works for you....

Thanks once again"
