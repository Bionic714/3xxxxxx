Release Notes:

Former blink-182 co-founders Mark Hoppus and Travis Barker have reunited under
the aegis of a new band, (+44), and will release their much anticipated album,
When Your Heart Stops Beating on Interscope Records. The album is produced by
Hoppus and Barker and executive produced by long-time blink-182 producer Jerry
Finn.

Recruited for their new journey as (+44) û pronounced ôPlus 44ö û Shane
Gallagher (The Nervous Return) and Craig Fairbaugh (Transplants, The Forgotten,
Lars Frederiksen and the Bastards) join singer-bassist Hoppus and
drummer-keyboardist Barker and pick up where the popular, multi-platinum-
selling band blink-182 left off after splitting in late 2004. ôWe were twothirds
of blink-182, so weÆre not afraid of sounding like ourselves,ö says Hoppus.
ôWeÆre not divorcing ourselves from the past, but we are pushing beyond the
past. WeÆre progressing like musicians should.ö Barker agrees: ôMark and I have
a natural chemistry after playing together for so long and itÆs only gotten
stronger. This band is a continuation of blink-182 but itÆs also different. For
a long time, blink-182 was an underdog. I like being the underdog again.ö
