Story:
------
Released as Three Wishes for Cinderella in the US, Tri Orisky Pro Popelku has been a Christmas tradition in the Czech Republic since its original release in 1973, and also enjoys a large fan base in Germany and Norway. Based on the story by Bozena Nemcová, director Vaclav Vorlicek retells the classic Cinderella fairy tale with modern-day socialist feminism. Popelka (Libuse Safránková) is a servant in the house of her stepmother (Carola Braunbock). A resourceful and independent young girl, she confides her closest friend the owl. When she comes across three magical acorns, she is granted a single wish for each one of them. She meets the Prince (Pavel Trávnicek) in the woods and competes with him in sharpshooting and matches his wit in riddles. After disguising herself in hunting outfits, she makes her final wish for a beautiful wedding dress.
