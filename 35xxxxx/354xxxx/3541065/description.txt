Their new final release will include X1350XT, X1650Pro, X1650XT, X1950Pro, X1950XTX and X1950 Crossfire Edition capability (available at this time only using modified un-official drivers). New Catalyst 6.10 also include information about an X1650 with R580 core (wich card is that?). As you can see, their new drivers (not launched yet) include compatibility with vga cards that are just launched today (and there aren\\\'t any official drivers available for them at this moment)\"
