Sorry for anyone who was downloading the 27 Essential.Apps.Pack (by, cooldud) files. My pc needed to have a format done, due to them that think that adding Virus Shit is fun. Anyway I have made a new download, its better and has more things, now has 30, this time I have made a back up.
Hope you enjoy it,

thepiratebay needs more of you to seed.
