,RipperSeregon,2006-10-24T09:17Z,"But anyways, many other essential apps not included, and many unnecessary apps included.. (And Paint Shop Pro 9 is old ;)"
,g.n.cooldud,2006-10-24T16:41Z,"Many other essential apps are not included, true!
But when you have over 763 Apps over 147G`s to offer were do you start.

Paint Shop Pro 9 was ask by a friend so I added it, it may be old as you say, but a good old up date will make Paint Shop Pro up to date. 

Many unnecessary apps included. Unnecessary for whom. In less than 1min of this upload over 30 users are downloading it. Anyway if you let us know what you think are necessary apps maybe I will upload them.


Please keep uploading as long as possible after you finish downloading your torrent, 
that way you'll help others get the file too and keep the torrent alive!!!"

,sariimoo,2006-11-22T21:18Z,"WELL DONE!!! What a great and well put together package! How anyone can complain about it's inclusions is beyond me, you've given me everything I needed and inside of my budget (free, my favourite price!)!"
,danneman_77,2007-01-13T14:41Z,Why couldn't you rar each of the programs by itself. I only wanted some of them... Takes a lot of time to dl this thing...
,MarmTek,2007-01-28T16:30Z,I appreciate the great amount of work to do this so thanks a lot but why all the old and out of date stuff.  eg.  Norton AV and Adobe Acrobat when newer working versions are available?
,Canison,2007-02-05T03:02Z,if all i have to do is ask..: any chance you have RoboHelp X5 or the new ver 6?  nice kit you've offered.
