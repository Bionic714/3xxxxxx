Make it something like port 50987, and enable it for both TCP and UDP ports, incoming and outgoing. Some routers won't let you allow a port to have both settings TCP and UDP, and if that's the case, create 2 port rules, 1 for TCP and 1 for UDP.

On your PC, add the same port and rules (again for both TCP and UDP) to whatever firewall program you use (like Windows Firewall). 

Now, under Azureus, in the menu, go to Tools>NAT/Firewall Test. The port number you created, add it to the text field, then 'Test'. When it says, ok, hit apply. If it don't work, restart your PC, modem, router, etc., open Azureus again, and do the NAT/Firewall test again. Hope that helps you, stilez."
