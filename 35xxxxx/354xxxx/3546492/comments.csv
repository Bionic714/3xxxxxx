,newuzer,2006-10-27T17:08Z,"Well, DVD2 is still here at TPB, so there's no need to do that as of yet.

We're (at this moment) at 34.5% and it looks like it's still being seeded.
Should it be removed when it's finished, I will recreate it :)

I looks like all finished torrents of North and South are being removed.
All three (reseeded) torrents of Book 1 are gone.
I have no idea why..."
,Hellraiser5,2006-10-27T20:34Z,"Can nobody read here? the torrent from Disk 2 is over 14 days  old ,and no downloads are completed!!!!!
So whats the problem to reseed Disk2??
"
,daqck,2006-10-27T20:57Z,"rrray did upload ALL of north and south, so since he's got some finished they will finish faster.
can you not read i did say OVER 30% for disc 2"
,daqck,2006-10-27T21:03Z,"found this:-

,daqck,2006-10-28T17:08Z,"the simple answer is yes
he uploaded 8 disc's (not my way of doing it, but at least he's sticking with it) and since this wasn't on here , a very healthy torrent

just as well you weren't after Phar Lap as he could only upload on weekends with a 56k modem and couldn't even keep an eye on it to make sure it was seeding, and then fucked it off while ppl needed 30%. so think yourself lucky."
,Hellraiser5,2006-10-28T18:41Z,"hey i dont complain i am happy with what i can get, but if you dont have the speed why put on torrents that can not be downloaded.It starts to look like Kazaa shit here :-)
Thats disk 2 from book 3 is stucked on 48 something% and it will take probably a couple of 24 hr days before its completed that is if that seeder dont take it off again before we are finished.Like he did before.....
i just think its strange that ""newuzer"" can´t reseed the 2nd disk.While he has the files .
FFS we're talking about a louzy 4.5 Gb's"
,newuzer,2006-10-28T22:58Z,"Who says I have the files?

I only posted the first DVD from rrray again because it was pulled from TPB as soon as we (that includes me) hit 100%.
If you actually read what I wrote above, you could have known ;)

So, rrray is providing us DVD2 also and we are thankful to him for that (52.5% atm).
If it's being pulled like the first one, don't worry, I will post it again."
