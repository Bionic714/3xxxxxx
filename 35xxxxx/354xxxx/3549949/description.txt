Leningrad (????????? in Russian) is a Russian ska punk band from Saint Petersburg (former Leningrad).

Composed of 14 members, the band appeared in the late 1990s around singer Sergey \"Shnur\" Shnurov (?????? ??????). It soon became famous for its vulgar lyrics (see Russian mat), the main reason it was avoided by most radio stations at first. But this did not stop its growing popularity. As Shnurov said himself: \"Our songs are just about the good sides of life, vodka and girls that is.\" The band is known to be disliked by Moscow mayor Yuri Mikhailovich Luzhkov, who cancelled many of their concerts in the city. But since then, the band has made its way to radio and TV (filler noises covering the rude words, certain songs containing many of these filler noises), with Shnurov even presenting some New Year\'s Eve TV shows.

Leningrad has gained some popularity in other parts of the world due to a well known Adobe Flash animation, created by Toondra, set to their song \"Menya Zovut Shnur\" (Russian: ┬½???? ????? ????┬╗) or \"My Name is Shnur\" in English.

Three songs by Leningrad appeared prominently on the soundtrack to the 2005 movie Everything Is Illuminated
