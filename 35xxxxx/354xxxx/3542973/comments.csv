I tried using the original 1.60 crack but it doesnt seem to work... Any suggestions...

I dont like mounting with daemon tools everytime..."
,iLeeT_PeeP,2006-11-02T23:34Z,"I figured it out for any of you peeps that may be interested...

This may help...

Using the game images ""Open"" both cds manually from my computer to view the cd contents... copy the S3GOLD1.DAT (from CD1) and S3GOLD2.DAT (from CD2) into the C:\BlueByte\Settlers3 directory along with an original cracked 1.60 s3.exe

This should work...

Good Games PeePs..."
