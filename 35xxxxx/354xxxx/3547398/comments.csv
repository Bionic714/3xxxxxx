,meisbored,2006-10-29T02:44Z,can ne1 seed?
,DrBraun,2006-10-29T02:52Z,I'm seeding like a biatch!
,calavera00,2006-10-29T16:19Z,"OH my god I can't believe this is happening, thank you so much. You have no idea how much I've been looking forward to this game!"
,john2k5,2006-10-31T14:25Z,"this looks real fake, all 3 isos are exact same size, and why have 3 isos when all 29 songs would fit on one disk?? especially if it is just a *cracked* demo as the title suggests?? that would just mean 1 iso, but a small hack to unlock all other *hidden* files, anyway i'll dl and report back, but don't get your hopes up! :D"
,john2k5,2006-10-31T15:17Z,"Ok guys, done some research and it seems legit! lots of vids on youtube of hacking the demo to play GH1 songs, all they have to do is replace .YYZ files of the demo with the ones from GH1, so this hack could be real, but i dunno how you could get the .YYZ files of GH2 this early on before release?!?! Anyway, here's hoping! If someone who already has it could let me know that it works for sure, then i'd appreciate it, also does it change the track names on the menu of the hacked disks or is it just that the songs play when u select a different song name? ie, disk 2 ""heart shaped box"" would you select Butthole Surfers from menu or does it say Nirvana? Thats all for now! Cya"
,john2k5,2006-10-31T16:48Z,"Even more research, turns out that this is 99% proven to work! The link on scorehero that is talked about in the main post is: h**p://www.scorehero.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=2337 
A guy there has released 2 small hack patches (PPF Format) that convert your demo to 10 different songs, all that the uploader here has done is applied both patches and upped the isos to save others having to patch their own files! so THANK YOU DRBRAUN for the upload, You, Sir, are a God! Can't wait to play Heart Shaped Box by Nirvana!!! My hand's gonna hurt tomorrow!"
,chud575,2006-10-31T18:39Z,"anyone know if this demo has left flip? the OPM demo didnt, and i dont want to play in front of a mirror if i can help it ;)"
,haazuki,2006-10-31T18:47Z,"this totally works...names are not overwrited so game says that you are playing war pigs when you really are playing ""Free Bird""..."
,john2k5,2006-10-31T19:49Z,"Works Perfecto!!! N no lefty flip that i'm aware of, sorry :("
,Royvedas,2006-11-01T01:43Z,"aaarrrgh no lefty flip!!! God dammit, why won't anyone cater to us carrying superior lefty genes?"
,topseeder,2006-11-02T03:54Z,"You are the man!
Thanks alot.
Will seed till the final game out."
,hummus88,2006-11-03T00:05Z,"What sort of programme do i use to play this?
Is it an emulator for PS2 that i need?
I haven't downloaded games before....
thanks"
,thenewmullen,2006-11-05T06:30Z,where can i find the 10 song demo of guitar hero 2. I only have the OPM version. I'm lost on what to do. Please send info.
