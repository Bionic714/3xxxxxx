These three files will replace the ones that were in the original download. 

There\\\'s a gap (~1.4 secs) at the end of For Your Love which needs to be removed, and the track fades at the end. The output levels on the complete My Generation are considerably higher than the original, and there is also a difference in EQ
between the 2 tracks (the original has more bass).

This is only track 5-7 of CD3.
