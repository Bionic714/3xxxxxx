,BucKFasT,2006-10-18T00:07Z,"Absolutly brilliant game this edition of Football Manager! I´m in a very good state of mind :-) 

Very easy install no problems at all, and for you MAC guys, don´t think this is your download, haven´t seen it in the package anyways, can´t you use a program for it though? A PC emulator or something. 

Anyways read the threads here and some of you that are having problems installing it, just do it like this.

1) Unpacking it, yes it looks like winrar wouldnt do the job but it does, just:
Right click on a file and click open. 
then you see 2 files, unpack the bigger one and put it for example in the same map as the rest of the files.
2) Now you have a image you can mount with deamon tools. Mount it.
3) Installation begins.
4) When the installation is finnished, just close fotball manager down, no need to start the game just now :-)
5) Check your deamon tool virtual drive and on My Computer, there you see FM 2007 mounted. Right click and press explore.
6) Inside you will see a map called Razor1911 open it.
7)Here you see the crack. Copy that image and paste it into your folder were you just installed the game. When prompted to overwrite, press YES.
8) Start the game and ENJOY football manager at its best!

Good luck! I´m off playing again :-)"

,ante_0227,2006-10-18T18:35Z,"Hej!
Jag har lite problem med en del saker. 

1. Först packar jag upp filen rzr-fm2007.001 så att det blir en rar-fil. Men när jag ska extracta rar filen så blir det på nytt en fil som heter rzr-fm2007.001. Allt har jag gjort med Winrar. Men vad gör jag för fel. Det blir ett likadant fel när jag försökt med NHL07. 

2. Men när jag använder Unrar så går det. Då blir det en cue och en bin fil. Men då när jag har bränt (mountat,provat båda) så kommer inte installationen upp. Och när jag trycker på själva dvd-enheten kommer det upp en massa filer, ex autorun och setup fm 2007 PC. Och då när jag försöker öppna dem går det inte, det bara kommer bara snabbt upp en svart ruta som försvinner på direkten. Varför går  det inte? Jag är så sugen på att köra nu. 

Jag skulle vara väldigt tacksam för svar.

1. Högerklicka på en av filerna, och kör den i WinRar, i Winrar ser du två st filer, en bin och en cue.
2. Markera båda, och ""extracta"" dom.
3. Dom ligger nu i den mappen där rar filerna ligger, det är nu du ska öppna/använda daemon tools, du vänster klickar på daemon tools och trycker på device. Där får du välja vilken fil du vill mounta, och då går du till mappen där den uppackade filen ligger (BIN FILEN), sedan sköter daemon tools jobbet.
4. Om du har gjort rätt så startar installationen och du får välja var du vill installera den mm.
5. När du har installerat, så går du in på ""Den Här Datorn"" och sedan på din cd/dvd läsare, då ser du mappen Razor1911.
5. Du tar den filen som ligger i mappen och kopierar den till den mapp där du installerade spelet, då kommer datorn fråga om du vill skriva över filen, och det vill du.

6. Om du har gjort som jag har skrivit så ska spelet fungera, det gör det iaf för mig! :)

extract to a folder of your choice in the folder there will be 2 files. a BIN file and a iso file.

when the game has installed go to my computer and find the drive fm2007 has been mounted to. 
click OPEN, there will be a file called razor1911 open that folder, right click the icon and choose COPY 
 now click your C: drive and go to programme files. Scroll down to sports interactive and choose football manager 2007. 
right click in the folder and click PASTE when it asks if you want to replace click YES
close everything down and run the game.  It should work

as a precaution I right clicked the football manager 2007 icon on the desktop clicked properties and then compatibilty. I changed it to run in Windows NT 4:0 service pack 5

1 Unpack = with the newest winrar version.
2Mount = with Alcohol 120% or deamon tools.(these make virtual cd/dvd drive(s))
  Burn alc. 120% again or Record now max.( my favorit)
3 It's starts from your virtual drive or real cd drive, if not click 2x on setup exe.
4 Now the after instal ,open razor 1911 file in your virtual or real drive.
Copy the whole map's contents( right clickyour mouse and click copy)
then go to :  C:/ program files/sports........fm 2007 en then paste it by right clicking your mouse again.
If correct you should get a message if you want to replace this file of blablabla MB with this one of blabla MB.
5 That's it . If you didn't screw up, it should function.

1) First you need two programs: ?WinRAR? and ?Daemon Tools?. Install them!

2) Download the game.

3) You will now have some ?strange? files in the FM2007 folder. Double click on the first file named ?rzr-fm07.001? and choose to open it with WinRAR. 

4) You are now in WinRAR and you should see two files: ?.bin & .cue?. Extract them to a folder that you choose. You can place them on the desktop for example. WinRAR will now unpack ALL files to your selected folder. 

5) After you installed Daemon Tools you should have an icon to you bottom right corner. Klick it once and choose ? Device 0: [*:] No Media. 

6) Browse to your new FM2007 folder and open the .cue-file. Start installing the game.

7) If Football Manager doesn?t start to install ? open My Computer and look for a dvd-rom drive that contains the FM2007 dvd. And install it from there.

8) When you are done, go to My Computer and right click on the dvd-drive and choose ?Explore?. Here you should see a folder named ?Razor1911?. And in it you find an icon. 

9) Copy this icon to the Football Manager folder: Default is:
?C:\Program Files\Sports Interactive\Football Manager 2007?

10) When you are asked to replace old icon you choose YES.

11) Play the Game!

,LuNk4n,2006-10-21T16:59Z,"Min svenska amatör-Guide (som även går att applicera på andra spel)


Såhär gjorde jag för att packa upp spelet:

1) Först och främst behöver du dessa två program: ??WinRAR?? och ??Daemon Tools??.

2) Installera dessa två program.

3a) Tanka hem spelet om du inte redan har gjort det. Och medans du tankar?
3b) ?Skapar du en mapp, t.ex på skrivbordet, som du döper till ??Lunkan är bäst??.

4) I den mapp du nu fått hem ligger ett gäng filer med filändelsen .001 till .039. Här finns ett gäng alternativ att angripa problemet. Men såhär gjorde jag: Jag dubbelklickade på den första filen ??.001??. Nu kommer en dialogruta att visas där Du väljer ??Välj Program i en Lista??. I rullistan som dyker upp söker du reda på WinRAR och väljer detta program.

5) Nu hamnar du i WinRAR och du skall här se (om du valde .001) två filer. En ??.bin?? och en ??.cue??-fil. Markera dessa filer och välj ??Packa upp Till??. 

6) I dialogrutan som visas söker du upp mappen du skapade tidigare. I detta fall ??Lunkan är bäst??. Det som bör hända nu är att alla dessa 39 filer vi såg tidigare packas upp och du får två hela filer i din mapp ? .bin och .cue filerna. (Men om detta inte funkar läs längre ner i denna guide).

7) När du installerade Daemon Tools bör du ha fått en ikon i aktivitetsfältet som finns längst ner till höger i Start-raden. Tryck en gång på denna ikon och välj alternativet ??Device 0: [*:] No Media??. (Jag använder version 3.11 så detta kan variera om du har en nyare version).
Du får nu upp en ny ruta och här söker du reda på mappen ??Lunkan är bäst?? och öppnar den. Och här borde du nu se .cue-filen. Öppna!

8) Om spelet nu inte försöker kontakta dig så gå till ??Den här Datorn??. Sök reda på DVD-driven som innehåller spelet och starta installationen här ifrån istället.

8) När spelet är installerat går du (igen) till ??Den här Datorn?? och söker reda på DVD-driven som innehåller spelet. Du högerklickar och väljer ??Utforska??.
Du bör nu befinna dig inne på DVD-skivan och se en mapp som heter ??Razor1911??, som innehåller en ikon som du ska kopiera och klistra in där du installerat spelet?

9) ?Om du inte ändrat något under installationen ska du klistra in ikonen här:
C:\Program Files\Sports Interactive\Football Manager 2007
Den nya ikonen ska ersätta den ikon som finns på adressen ovan. När du klistrar in den blir du tillfrågad om du vill ersätta befintlig ikon. Svara JA. Om du inte blir tillfrågad om detta har du klistrat in den på fel ställe. Ta bort ikonen och gör om! (Tyvärr kan jag inte beskriva det mindre krångligt än såhär. Fråga en datakunnig i din närhet om du inte vet vad jag pratar om).

10) Starta spelet!  

*** EXTRA ***
(vet ej om något av detta fungerar i praktiken eftersom jag inte provat ännu men det fungerar i teorin. Prova:)
4) Du kan byta namn på varje fil: Du ersätter den första nollan med ett ??r??. 
Exempel: Från ??rzr-fm07.021?? till ??rzr-fm07.r21??. Dom sista i nummerserien får dock ingen ny ikon, men det är nog i sin ordning. När du är klar högerklickar du på den första, r01, och väljer ??packa upp till rzr-fm07??. Det skapar automatiskt en mapp där filerna packas upp.

Eller 

Tanka hem den senaste versionen av WinRAR.

Denna guide är skapad i all hast eftersom jag såg att många hade problem med att packa upp spelet. Stavfel och annat får ni ha överseende med.

,NaZo,2006-10-22T16:20Z,"TROUBLESHOOT: Installer ""One or more errors occurred during the copying of files (bean 13)""
Added on 21/10/2006 @ 04:28:49
Applies to FM 2007

If the error during, or after, installation displays the error

""One or more errors occurred during the copying of files (bean 13), please refer to the install log for additional information""

then the installation did not complete successfully for some reason. We have yet to track down the exact cause(s) for this, but there are certain workarounds you can try to fix it.

Please note that if you experience this error, it may cause a side effect in the game where you will see black screen when running the game. This is due to the installer failing to install all the files it should do, and there many possible reasons for it, some of which are covered below.

1. Anti-virus or other security software preventing the installer from installing all files

In some cases anti-virus software (or other security software) may be preventing the installer from installing the all the files it is trying to install. If this happens, the above error may occur. If this occurs, please follow the instructions for how to do a clean re-install, then disable the anti-virus (or other security software) and try to re-install the game. You may want to reboot the computer between disabling the anti-virus and attempting to install the game.

Once the installation has completed you can re-enable the anti-virus software, however you should exlude the FM installation folders and the FM user data folders (see this document for FM07 folder locations from any real-time monitoring system. If it is monitoring all the FM07 folders in real-time it will severly affect the FM07 performance.

2. Make sure the Java version is compatible

Please refer to the general installer issues document for details on how to uninstall any current Java version, and download and install the latest one from Sun.

3. Install game from Safe Mode

If it still doesn't work, it may help installing the game from safe mode. Please note that you should only attempt this if a previous install failed with the above error. If not, the copy protection system may not have been installed correctly and it may not be allowed to installed correctly from Safe Mode, which may in turn cause the game not to run.

    * First clean up all FM07 folders from your system by deleting all contents in the following locations: C:\Documents and Settings\\Sports Interactive\Football Manager 2007\, C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Sports Interactive\Football Manager 2007\ and C:\Program Files\Sports Interactive\Football Manager 2007.
    * Please be aware that if you have any savegames, edited databases, updated skins or other data you want to keep you should back up any such data before deleting the contents of the above folders.
    * Reboot Windows into Safe Mode (Reboot your computer, press F8 after the BIOS screen (with logo and/or memory details, etc) - a menu pops up, choose ""Safe Mode"" from this menu and boot into Windows Safe Mode.
    * Run th FM0 installer and install the game.
    * Reboot the computer.
    * Start FM07."

Insert and explore the CD Image and run the 'fm.mac command'. The game installs using XDarwin. You do not need to crack the game. Also, I am quite sure this is Universal Binary, as it runs very nicely on my MBP.

I've have the same problem as some of you got. Not with installing, but with the game freezes! I've read atleast 2 of you had it. 

The problem: When i start a new game, everything looks and works fine, but however, when the game is done with the loading part, it freezes, just right before we're supposed to pick our manager details.. 

The wierd part is that, the first time i installed the game, i managed to start a game, and im capible to load that, but now, it freezes same what, if im trying to create a new game.. 

When the game has froze, the fm07.exe takes round 50% of my cpu, and i never seen it change..(if this information is useful) 

I want a solution for this, as many other people do. Thanks for reading this, and if you got any idea or solution for this matter, please dont hasitate :)"
,LitZmO,2006-10-27T00:49Z,"As eager i was to start a new game tonigh, i went for a solution. Searched lots of forums!

And now! To those who got the same problem as me, (look at the post above) I HAVE THE SOLUTION!

First of all, to prevent any other people to do the same mistake. WHEN YOU'RE STARTING A NEW GAME, AND,OR CREATING ANOTHER MANAGER! DO NOT! I REPEAT DO NOT, ADD A OWN PICTURE OF YOURSELF OR ANYTING TO THAT PROFILE! 

In order to fix this problem, you need to reset your settings. In order to do that, you need to add something to your FM07 shortcut.

01. Right click on your FM07-shortcut on the desktop, and press properties.

02. And than you got another box open! 

03. And in the field where it says ""Target"" you should add a little text at the end. And the magic text is: --reset_preferences

In my case, i've installed the game in: C:\Litzmo\Spill\Football Manager 2007\fm.exe , so after doing this in the target field it says: ""C:\Litzmo\Spill\Football Manager 2007\fm.exe"" --reset_preferences 
(NOTE: C:\Litzmo\Spill\Football Manager 2007\fm.exe is the direction where I installed the game and not where YOU did. So the text will say something else in your cases)

04. And then run the game!

Well, im off. Hope that i managed to help some of you!
Going to play FM07 all night long! 
I hope to get feedbacks! If it works, and if it did not!"

,LitZmO,2006-10-27T03:09Z,"First of all, you need to unpack them first, so lets consentrate on that first.

You need to have winrar, to unpack those files, and you said you got it, so that part should be fine.

Ok. Go into your folder, where the downloaded files are. If im not mistaken, the files you downloaded consist of 40 files, witch ends on many numbers like, .001, .002 and so on.

Locate the file that ends on .001, it should be at the top. And you need to open that file in Winrar.

If it isnt automaticly opened in winrar, you need to right click it! And press Open in? (Whats with the ""?"" you say? And i answer that my operating system windows xp is norwegian, so i dont really remember what it says in the english version)

And when you are done with pressing the open in button, you will have to choose winrar from a list, and press ok! 

Then winrar will open these files, and uncover 2 files! Those files are called: rzr-fm07.bin and rzr-fm07.cue.

Extract those files into some other folder! (these are a copy of an original cd, only its contained on the harddrive, witch you are gonna run via Daemon Tools afterwards)"
,shrinkboy,2006-10-27T03:16Z,thank you litzmo for responding...but when i right click on the .001 file i cannot open this??? is it already unpacked? this whole thing doesnt appear to be compressed or something???
,LitZmO,2006-10-27T03:28Z,"And then! For those who dont know how the Deamon Tools is working.

Aiit.. So by now you guys got these 2 files right?

rzr-fm2007.bin (this is the actual copy of the cd)

rzr-fm2007.cue (this is a small file that many times proves unesseraly, the only feature i know this have is the autorun)

So! If you got these 2 files, you need to make sure you got daemon tools downloaded and installed. (if not search google for it)

Aiit.. If the Daemon tools are installed, you will see a red icon by down by your clock (it looks like a cd, with a red lightning infront of it)

A-kay... If you are with me this far, you can press the daemon icon by your clock, and choose: Device 0: [ :] No media

When you're done with that part there will appare a new box with title: ""Select new image file""

In that box, you'll need to locate those files i was talking about, rzr-fm2007.bin and rzr-fm2007.cue

The rzr-fm2007.cue is the file you should open with the daemon tools.

And when thats done. You can enter ""my computer"" and see that there is an extra dvdrom with FM2007 in it :) 

Just dobble click and install :D"
,shrinkboy,2006-10-27T03:29Z,ohthank the lord above i now have the bin and cue file you talked about!!  where do i go from here?
,LitZmO,2006-10-27T03:30Z,"Yeah.. I understand your problem.

Can you right click the .001 file and just press open? And what happens?

This will help me to an answer ;)"
,LitZmO,2006-10-27T03:31Z,"I've already made an comment on that, right above your post ;) 

Just read and ask if you get stuck :)"
,shrinkboy,2006-10-27T03:37Z,"ok ive followed your helpful instructions and the game appears to be loading now, you are indeed a fine man! if you would ever like to visit manchester and watch the mighty united you just say so!!"
,shrinkboy,2006-10-27T03:43Z,now it asks me to insert the cd rom and restart application???
,LitZmO,2006-10-27T03:44Z,"Yeah! I hope you manage to take the Crack from the Cd now. That the only thing that can stop you! hehe.. :) But i think you can do that on your own.

Im glad i could help! Hope that you will be pleased by the game! I am indeed!

I would really love to come to england to watch a football game, but im really a big fan of Liverpool. That's the real big team in my heart :)

Hope you will give Solskjær some time on the field by the way! If you're gonna manage Man Utd :)"
,shrinkboy,2006-10-27T03:48Z,of course ole is a legend here
,LitZmO,2006-10-27T03:55Z,"Yeah! THAT was the crack i was telling you about! okey.. :) No problem! This would take a sec!

First! Enter ""my computer"" and locate the cd called ""FM 2007"" Right click it, and press open or explore.

From there you will see a folder called ""Razor1911"" right?.. 

Double click that one :) 

In that folder there is a file called fm(.exe)

This file is called a crack, what it does, it by passes the security of a cd to not get the error message ""insert the right disk(or anything like that)""

What you'll need to do with that file is right click it, than press ""copy""

And when you're done with that, you'll need to find the installation folder of FM2007 (the standard installation folder is c:\programfiles\sports interactive\football manager 2007, if im not mistaken)

When you have located the folder where the FM2007 is installed, you will se another file like the fm(.exe) that you copied from the cd earlier.

What you'll have to do, is paste the new fm(.exe) into this folder and replace it with the old one!.. 

And then run the game!

BUT! I hope that you have read the ting i wrote about the picture thing! If not. I'll say it again: When creating a new manager, DONT apply your own picture. (this will make FM2007 freeze in the future) "
,shrinkboy,2006-10-27T04:04Z,"thanks forhelping me again, but hwen i do exactly as you say i keep getting the message - please insert the correct cd-rom??"
,shrinkboy,2006-10-27T04:08Z,"no!!! its ok ive finally worked it out. you have been a great help....all the best of luck to liverpool this season, after last week i think you may need it. thanks friend!"
,LitZmO,2006-10-27T04:14Z,"When you have not ""cracked"" the game (meaning of the word cracked: To have replaced the fm(.exe) file thats in the installation folder of FM2007, with the one found on the cd)

If you have not ""cracked"" the game yet, you'll get an error message like that, because the computer can tell that you do not have the original cd!

But if you have ""cracked"" the game, you will not see that error message.

The error message can be different from game to game. I cant remember the spesific message from FM2007. But everyone got the same meaning. Meaning you dont have the original cd inserted! (here's an example: Error: Please insert the right disc, Error: Cannot find the original disc, make sure you have it inserted and try again)"
,LitZmO,2006-10-27T04:18Z,"Sure! No problem! Hope you'll be doing great in FM2007!

And yeah.. :( 2-0 loss over man utd, a shame.. but, fair.. I personaly think that Liverpool got there chances, but wasted them all. Well.. We'll have another try later this season ;)"

Nevertheless i managed to unpack it (with the crc error). Now i mounted the cue/bin file with deamon tools, but then i'm not able to install the game -> i also have no chance to burn this unpacked image on cd (i tried it like discribed on page 7 also)

1. open the .001 file in winrar.
2. extract the .bin file.
3. mount the .bin file, which is now in the folder where you have put it, using whatever you normally use (daemon tools or alcohol, or whatever it is you use)
4. install it, play it, and enjoy it :)

1. öppna .001 filen i winrar.

Now to give something back, if you've noticed SI couldn't licences for everything, and thus certain players & teams have fake names, and this can really shatter the realism. To circumvent this simply open your FM directory, and go to data\db\700 and simply remove the ""lnc"" folder therein. Then simply start a new game and all should have their real names back, unfortunately think that this only affects new games from then on though."
