Gothic Melancholy Vol.19 - Home made compilation by AssMaster
Released at The Pirate Bay

Quality differs from 128 kbps to vbr ~200 kbps, most songs
are around 192 kbps though. I haven't ripped these tunes,
they're picked from various albums, both scene and non-scene
releases. I take only credit for compiling the albums.

The genres varies from gothic rock, metal, electronic and
death metal, all with the gothic feeling :)

Enjoy while you can, I've decided that I'm gonna quit this
series with vol 20. One more to go...


Enjoy the stuff, and help to seed when done, as always :)
Also, cheer me up with a comment, you succubi leechers!
