,boeddi,2006-10-31T16:51Z,"Mycket märkligt. en minut efter jag gnällde, finns det plötsligt en komplett källa. Ration är nu 1.916. Tack. jag blev bönhörd."
,Slaytanic_pb,2006-11-12T06:16Z,"I see that this has been downloaded 38 times, and there's only 1 other seeder (thou I don't see that other seeder in my torrent client).  Hey, everyone who downloaded and ran, thanks for the help in seeding...  No, really, thanks a lot...  You're so fucking helpful.  God damn fucking leeches..."
,radicaldinosaur,2007-04-24T18:15Z,"first, i would like to thank Slaytanic for the thought, effort, and time put into making this available for all of us here, but i have found there are significant problems with this rip.

of the 20 or so episodes i have watched thus far, most, if not all episodes have at least 1-2 or more places where large pixelation occurs across  most of the frame for several seconds.

i have also heard a few pops in the audio, and specifically in the episode Carlie X, the audio is not in sync at all.

it would be most appreciated if you re-riped this and made a flawless torrent of the entire original series."
,mastertae,2007-06-19T20:00Z,"I'm having codec problems with a few of the episodes like Miri as one example...I was wondering if anyone knew what codecs I needed...some files work fine, but other don't..."
,smurphyzeke,2008-02-16T07:20Z,"Thanks, never seen the show, ever."

,princess_usagi,2008-04-28T22:26Z,"You guys really need to seed, I've been trying to d/l this for a while (a couple weeks at least) and I haven't gone past 2.1%.
I am such a huge trekkie living in a region where apparently The Original Series is the holy grail of all trekkie items and it is impossible for me to acquire. 
PLEASE SEED!!!!"
,mojobug,2008-04-30T07:12Z,"A desperate SEED PLEAD!
Help us Trekkies get this whole thing.
This thing is running at Dial-Up speeds..."
,linuxuser31,2008-05-28T14:43Z,"I can watch this only with a computer, but not with my DVD Player. It is about 3 years old, but till now I have thrown absolutely everything at it.
Does anybody else have the same problem? Thanks."
,zikman23,2008-07-03T23:19Z,"oh man, after a month and a half of on-and-off downloading, I finally finished this torrent... can't wait to start watching it now... will seed for as long as I can. already at 2.28 ratio"
,linuxuser31,2008-08-31T08:28Z,"If you can't play these files as they are (I have problems on 3 different players) convert them to DVD with DVD Flick.
For best results don't compress them too much, I am putting 9 episodes on a dual-layer DVD."
,kozykanuk,2008-11-25T16:37Z,I've been watching some of the completed files while downloading..I think the quality is excellent ..playing perfectly with VLC player..many thanks Slaytanic
,boomerwang,2008-12-31T05:34Z,SEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEED!!!!!!!!!!! please!
,CWbridd,2009-02-27T01:25Z,"great upload, Slaytanic, many thanks. i'm seeding constantly now, and will seed till piratebay is up, god save it!"
,Hymie1,2009-03-19T12:18Z,The video quality of this is SHIT. This guy doesn't know how to encode properly. He didn't deinterlace the video at all. Get another torrent if you want good quality rip of this series.
,nyiddle,2009-05-19T17:46Z,"is the quality of this really as bad as people say?

TV quality is fine for me, but if it's badly encoded then it might not be worth the download.

When I complete some of the files I'll check it out and post what I think; I know a significant amount about encoding video/audio so I will pass a judgment."
