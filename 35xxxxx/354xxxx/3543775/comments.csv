,guildmaster,2009-04-15T17:53Z,"The research into this presentation and knowledge departed should be highly acknowledged and well publisized by the media, but we all know that aint happening due to the fact it would get everybody thinking about stuff that the BBC or sky didnt tell them to fucking think about, I heard that he may have links with the rosicrucian society either way he speaks wise words.    ps  FUCK THE E.U !!!"
,Drumerguy12,2009-04-26T15:53Z,"This guy is possibly the worst orator I have ever heard speak. He is incredibly dry and doesn't even read his own PowerPoint slides in full sentences, pauses at the most awkward times. That being said, The information presented is really quite interesting, and if you can get past his horrendous speech and cheesy camera effects you will be quite intrigued."
