In Program One, of the ?Origins & Oracles? series, Michael Tsarion takes us on a vivid journey back to the time of the lost continents of Atlantis and Lemuria. On this journey, timeless mysteries are unraveled and explained like never before. Masses of disinformation concerning pre-history and the origins of humanity, which have duped scholars and researchers for generations, are eradicated and we are finally able to connect the dots and comprehend how the innumerable idioms of our modern world came into being. In the tradition of Immanuel Velikovsky, Zechariah Sitchin, Jordan Maxwell, Graham Hancock and Michael Cremo, Michael Tsarion investigates the true origins of mankind and throws open doors which have been sealed for many an age.

Enriched with a plenitude of rare source-material, Michael?s scholarly work investigates the records of our ancient forbearers. Michael also reveals to us the secrets of his own Celtic ancestors who, behind the veil of folklore, had much to say about alien visitation, genetic manipulation, wars of the gods, the coming of evil, the Anti-Christ, and the degradation of spirit. It is doubtful whether you will watch and hear anything more lucid concerning the fascinating mysteries of occultism, genetics, Darwinism, ufology, the paranormal, the phenomena of evil, secret-society intrigue, the ?New World Order? and the future the human race. This 15 hour-long magnum opus is compulsory viewing for those truth-hungry and educated seekers with a discriminating palate. This is revisionism at its best.
