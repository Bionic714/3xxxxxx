,Panodilo,2006-10-21T21:20Z,loool - Hey asshole! It was just a work of fiction.
,piratebill,2006-10-22T00:25Z,"Well no. You are wrong. This is what is called ""faction."" It is a blur betwen fact and fiction whose object is to deceive the public by suggestion. With your mocking comments you are attempting to do the same. But unfortunately what you don't realise is that Sam Fryman's average reader is about 10 divisions above your childish antics. Please criticise some more and we will make more ""sport"" of you."

,enjoyeverymoment,2011-12-22T19:02Z,"22/12/11 the COMPLETE works are being seeded right now. I decided to seed it all instead of just individual ones because I believe seeding the whole collection will allow everyone will be able to get the pdf they are looking for and keep it all in one organised, easy to search, easy to seed torrent. http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6905797/Sam_Fryman_Complete_Works_Nov_2011_PDF_E-Book"
