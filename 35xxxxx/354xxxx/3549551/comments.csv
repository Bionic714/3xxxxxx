,NisseP,2006-11-01T19:16Z,WOW. Thanks...
,speakeasy,2006-11-01T19:49Z,OMG!
,DrYes,2006-11-01T19:54Z,"Yikes, I spent a whole lot of work gathering these. Good work, too bad you didn't do it two years ago... :)"
,xionc,2006-11-02T16:43Z,"What about subtitles?
Have you got access to those?"
,PaulBunyan,2006-11-02T17:20Z,No subtitles. Most episodes are ripped from Sci-Fi channel. Not by me.
,PaulBunyan,2006-11-03T21:30Z,"Sorry for not being online in 24 hours.
Had problems with hard disks."
,danny_darko,2006-11-03T22:51Z,Thanks you and please seed
,NisseP,2006-11-03T22:56Z,all seasons except one can also be found at demonoid - if anyone is in a hurry or something. The last is at TVtorrents.
,mtoivo,2006-11-06T23:28Z,"I'm a bit afraid of the quality. I've used to ~350MB/45min quality, but some of these seem to be very much under that. Like the first two episodes from season1, together only 380MB? Gotta check the quality of 1st season before proceeding any more."
,PaulBunyan,2006-11-23T16:01Z,"My ratio for this torrent is now 14

I'll seed this 'till I get bored with it.

Probably after 1.1.2007 I'll stop seeding this."
,PaulBunyan,2006-11-27T17:25Z,Ratio now 16
,PaulBunyan,2006-11-30T17:03Z,ratio 17.5 now
,raptor550,2007-01-02T02:36Z,"Score!  I love Sci Fi and the Outer Limits.  I hope there is a lot of sharing in this torrent, it has some great value.  Thanks PaulBunyan for sharing 37GBx17!  I wish I could match that bandwidth."
,Wisa,2007-01-14T12:22Z,"Oh shit
thanx a lot man!"
,mauri644,2007-03-01T11:25Z,what program you use watching episodes? I can't watch any of those.
,Bowden,2007-03-19T17:05Z,I was looking for it more than 3 years! Thx MAN! =)
,struntprat,2007-04-11T11:09Z,"You gotta be kidding. I have near complete series on loads of poor VHS-tapes, I thought about how to try save this. But your collection will solve it all. A stunning work man! It's a treasure."
,valz23,2007-04-18T04:12Z,"Can somebody, please, seed!!! It's totally dead. Stock at 45.3%
Thank you ahead! I'll promise to seed for a 2 weeks, if somebody helps me finish!"
,maxkill,2007-08-15T14:49Z,geez biig =) 
,Te_Je,2007-09-07T04:38Z,Yes!! I've looking for this series complete in years... Thanks!:=)
,basketballismylife,2007-09-07T05:53Z,these are VCD quality not worth downloading very grainey with some stupid logo added to tne bottom of the begining of each? episode. A lot of effort for so-so quality. You should include stats or a sample for such a large upload
,PaulBunyan,2007-09-29T09:27Z,"Sorry for not bringing any information about quality.
I told in my comments that everything is ripped from sci-fi channel, forgotting to mention that there is sci-fi ch's logo in every episode. Quality is indeed about same you can found on old vhs's. If there is dvd releases of this series, could somebody tell me about it, i could have them bought for me and ripped 'em for all of you.
Thank you for previous comments."
,PaulBunyan,2007-09-29T09:32Z,"Oh, i forgot, my friend has collected all episodes of starg책te. i'm planning to get all (about 160 G's) of them to share for you. I still lack PSU from my No. 1 pc... Maybe for christmas..."
,neilaroo,2007-11-09T17:19Z,anyone have the 2 seasons of the old series--it's much better.
,PaulBunyan,2007-11-23T20:31Z,"Thanks for constructive comments from 
""KOBKED-X"" and ""basketballismylife""

Both of you are complaining about bad quality and both of you have uploaded 1 torrent each, total of 20.8 MB...

I DO upload things, how about you..?

Don't thou complain, thou have no level at all."
,Danux01,2007-12-01T16:10Z,"Thanks for taking the time to make this collection and share it, really appreciate the effort. Tough to find good stories, like these, any more."
,hiVe_,2007-12-30T19:08Z,"I'd like to thank PaulBunyan for this wonderful share! 
I've downloaded it some time ago (finally i may say, it was sooo slow on 128kbps line ^^).
Unfortunately my HDD broke recently and I'v lost everything. Could you kindly please keep it seeding for some time longer?

I believe you'd do us all a big favour~

Many thanks in advance.
Best wishes and merry christmass..."
,vitaliy2010,2008-01-06T01:03Z,Very Thanks you!!! Please seed for russian fans this serial. Thanks you!
,Drowlord,2008-01-10T20:01Z,Cool Show.  Thanks for the Torrent!
,Stexe,2008-01-14T01:02Z,"Unfortunately, these videos are poor quality and rips from the Sci-Fi channel and are therefore censored. It really messes up a few of the early episodes as they remove the cursing and nudity. Also, a lot of the scenes are blurry and hard to see. Would be better if you could get a rip from a DVD of the series. Still better than nothing..."
,PaulBunyan,2008-02-03T07:59Z,"I'm working on to get bigger and faster HD's for more to share. Also trying to find DVD-releases of this great show, so non of you who complained about messy quality and didn't read my earlier comments before long and painful download, thou shall weep on next package, which hopefully will contain whole series, not divx, but full dvd fit images."
,Typo91,2008-02-12T01:20Z,"5x13 only plays the first 26:47 and then stops..

its 229mb not as big as the others.

Also not all of them are ripped from Sci/FI and you see a LOT of boobies i am up to season 5... That girl from season 1 in esp (Valleriy 23) shows Full frontal nude!  She is like the hottest robot ever!  and she is a dudes Personal nanny/love slave in Mary 25 where you see full backside!!  i dont know who that chick is, but she is hot..

Lot of other famous people in these before they where big, too many to list, but there is one with the chick from the Speices movies... she gets naked too..  Outer limits has no shortage of boobs, or cool stories"
,TDX1,2008-02-23T08:40Z,"
I am new to Pirate Bay. Is there some special software I need to download before I can download 
PaulBunyan's complete Outer Limits 1995-2002?"
,No2097,2008-03-01T09:50Z,"There is complete season 1 on dvd, but i dont know if more seasons are on dvd. In my country not. It is good because there are english subtitles.
But quality from vhs isnt too bad :)"
,RufusThorne,2008-03-06T11:56Z,o__O   !!!    Oooh! Thanks for this. Amazing!
,hypersilent,2008-04-08T04:05Z,"Thank you SO much for uploading this. I am an aspiring writer, and the stories in OL are really aspiring to me. I would buy all the seasons on dvd if they was available. Again thanks, and thanks to the guys that keep hosting it:) Your seeding is much appreciated."
,Siafun,2008-04-13T22:58Z,Thanks PaulBunyan! great collection.
,TheDweep,2008-04-18T12:30Z,"Thanks for this great series.

One problem however. With the third season I've got two episodes that don't have sound sometime after the intro. This happened with S03E15 Revelations of Becka Paulson and with S03E18 A Special Edition. 

I have no idea how this can happen while watching the episode.

EDIT: Got it! Apparently, pausing the viewing does something to the sound line which can't be undone. I had to watch the episode in one go and not touch the controls of VLC. I guess that's because of the quality and the way they've been ripped. "
,djphatd,2008-05-05T07:20Z,PaulBunyan you are the greatest!  This is about the coolest torrent I have ever downloaded (still downloading)  I will gladly continue to seed this for a long time!  
,cali808,2008-07-23T10:47Z,"Thanks for this PaulBunyan, I'm sure many here will like these. And yes people, this is the newer series, not the original series (TOS)..
Sadly for me though, from what I can tell so far, even the best files here are below the quality I like (my guess/opinion).
I did download:
The Outer Limits - 1x01-02 - The Sandkings.avi (380.44 megabyte) from here and >
This looked more like a 180 MB version, unlike the better quality 300 MB versions I'm used to now. There might be some better ones in here, but I moved on to find better versions elsewhere, this is what I found:
Alas, I was able to find (with Google) better quality torrents for all these except seasons 2 & 4.
Note that the only season 1 torrents I could find are 6 full DVD rips here at TPB, of which I plan to further rip into smaller AVI's. The rest I found were good quality TV rips from SciFi Channel.
Point being, as it is now, it looks like the only way to get quality versions of seasons 2 & 4 is through R@pidsh@re (I know)....
I found them here:
k@tzforumsdotcom/archive/index.php/t-101156.htxx
k@tzforumsdotcom/archive/index.php/t-102401.htxx
Note: @=a  dot=.  xx=ml
Last, I posted this info here in hopes that we may get 1 quality torrent of all these eventually (I will try to do it too), until then, thanks to PaulBunyan we still have something, (better than nothing)."
,klingonmaniak,2008-11-11T23:35Z,seeds?
,sriepetine,2008-12-11T04:19Z,"The quality is worse than VHS on most of them.

The effort of the uploader *IS* appreciated nonetheless!"
,jonxjquee,2009-01-03T04:07Z,i have a problem with episod 5x13 - Summit it seems it won't play with anything i have
[T],kremit69,2009-03-24T20:14Z,"To all the naysayers you guys are jerks. This is THE BEST source for outer limits episodes anywhere on the net. 

Audio 8
Video 5-7 (different episodes have diff quality)

Overall this is AROUND VHS quality but like i said, diff qualities per episode.

Thank you paul, this torrent kicks ass!"
,PaulBunyan,2009-04-04T09:19Z,Nice to see that my torrent is still alive after 2 years and 4 months. Thanks to all those who did'nt quit seeding this.
,neondeception,2009-07-06T05:34Z,"watched all of season 1. They could download quicker, but I cant complain as they are free. Not the best quality, but watchable and audio has been clear and loud. I say good job on this one. Those looking for dvd quality should skip this."
,notenough,2009-07-23T11:41Z,Unfortunately these are the censored versions and not the versions with nudity. Bummer.
,accerules,2009-10-06T21:36Z,"VIDEO: 2-3 (Varies)

,Samforester,2010-02-02T09:38Z,Is the quality really  that bad and is it censored. I need a good quality and uncensored version.
,Samforester,2010-05-22T06:33Z,Great upload..... thanks alot.
,GamesoulMaster,2010-08-24T05:45Z,"To clarify to some people who wonder about the video quality vs file size... the bitrate is actually pretty good. However, the video size (at least on all the episodes I checked) is 320x240. Hence, watching at any decent resolution requires at least 2x stretching, and the decent bitrate isn't nearly enough to compensate for all that stretching.

I do appreciate the upload, as it's the only one here that contains the whole series. It just happened to not be suitable for my needs (my dad wanted the whole series on DVD, which looked horrible when I tested it)."

Thank You"
,krazeeeyezkilla,2010-12-08T16:32Z,"Thanks PaulBunyan, this is a classic torrent that I did dl once upon a time when I didn't have an external and my pc took a shit. To my everlasting sorrow it was lost. I hope to be seeding soon as I redeem myself and the wonderful torrent you've so generously bestowed upon us these past years. 

For those about to DL, we salute you!"
,AlmightyDread,2011-04-24T19:59Z,"The video and audio quality of these files is appalling. In its early days, this torrent was the best thing available, but it is long outdated, and should have been deleted. Thanks to the uploader for the original effort, but it is past time to put this beast to rest."
,ResistNWO,2011-05-07T08:58Z,stop bitching. you guys want a better picture how about buying the damn thing
,Philonetic,2011-06-08T06:20Z,"@ResistNWO
This was ok in 2006, but nowadays if an episode isn't atleast 720p and near 1g then it's pretty crap quality.  More and more people have faster and faster connections.  Times change, quality is expected.  Sorry for your small HDD and slow connection, but many of us are running 12tb+ servers on 10mbps connections, and we'd really like to get our time and moneys worth."

Shut the FUCK up you retarded idiot. 

320x240 was always crap and only for when you were desperate. 

About DVD quality or 480/576 is fine quality to watch any show in. 

720p WAS NEVER EVEN PRODUCED IN MOST OF THESE SHOW IDIOT. IT DOESN'T EXIST. I don't know what you're talking about 720p for.  "
,Eddiehjjjfcfjfc,2011-10-02T05:57Z,"So mclevels, you are the one that posted all the DVDRips?  Great job. :)  Why did you post them anonymously?  There's a guy, quual, saying they aren't really DVD rips because some of them are censored but that isn't true.  The DVD sets are censored as well.  All the eps I've watched so far look really good.  Thanks.  Amazing to me that so many people are downloading these low quality versions when yours are up."
[T],mclevels,2012-03-10T04:13Z,"@Eddiehjjjfcfjfc: This version has been promoted longer. Also as you can see now, a lot of it's seeders are dying down. I downloaded this one myself because it was all that was available. It's time for the better versions to take over now though."
