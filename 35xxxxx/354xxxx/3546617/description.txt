Didn\\\'t get this file from a torrent, so I create a new one. This version is tried and found working by me on a Macbook Pro in late October, so I can asure you it works. Yes, the crack as well.

Several bug fixes done since 5.0 but the main feature is universal binary, i.e. - it now officially supports Intel chipsets. Version 6 will be even better, since it gives greater support for multiple CPU and cores - so please upload it if you run across it!

I will seed whenever my computer is online, so don\\\'t give up just because the seeding might be slow or temporarily offline.
