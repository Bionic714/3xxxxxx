,djrvn,2006-12-04T14:24Z,"hi my ableton on my mac has crashed a msg pops up and asks me to contact tech support, does anyone know how to go abt this problem...??"
,kalaslemuren,2006-12-05T00:54Z,"I have installed it and cracked it, but it says ""Exporting  is not permitted in demo mode"".
Have I done anything wrong or is this crack just for the demo mode?
Both Live 5 and operator says they are unlocked.
Please help me!"
,waldomalone,2006-12-07T05:31Z,Do i have to worry about this trying to call home?

,nowtbeta2do,2007-03-13T21:36Z,"working, the way to get the hash key in is to hold alt and press 3... but and that's the only key that you have to put in that is not visible on the keyboard."
,victorfurbacken,2007-03-31T12:00Z,anybody got serial for 5.2?
,Bixxx,2007-04-29T23:52Z,"Donatoon - If you are refering to the 6.0 versions on the searchpage you linked, that version still isn't available with a working crack for Mac (as far as I know, please correct me if I am wrong). The existing 6.0 cracks despawns. It IS cracked for Windows - but not yet for native OSX.

For all you serial needs, make sure to ALWAYS download the latest Serial box before asking around; it usually does the trick. Check link below for current version as of April 2007!
http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3667748/Serial_Box_April_2007

Always follow the instructions step by step, especially in apps that require some sort of activation crack.

,mac_davis,2007-05-03T18:03Z,Awesome torrent man. Works like a charm! And a great piece of software too.
,mac_davis,2007-05-03T18:51Z,Yeah. I'm experiencing the same thing as kalaslemuren. It's randomly turning the program into a demo. Is Ableton too smart for us?
,pacanybe,2007-06-23T17:25Z,"ok, but in this 5.2 version i cant locate ""native instruments"" vst plugins, like i could do this in 5.1."
,boozernet,2007-07-12T15:49Z,"Finally, the S/N for Ableton Live 6.0.7 is available in the serial box from July 2007, BUT it needs a keygen, did anyone manage to find one?"
,TehSpife,2007-08-29T19:15Z,"Thank you very much for this! I love Live 5 but am unemployed and can't raise the munnies for the full version D:
I got to ask before I start seriously working on it, this version doesn't crash or scramble what you save right? (I've heard some cracks are given out by Ableton so you get to ""demo"" their software, but then it crashes and you can't load what you worked on). I know it was uploaded almost a year ago (and I read no complaints) but I just really got to know. Thanks and thanks again!"
,chaosdroid,2007-11-18T23:57Z,unfortunately the included patch doesn't work on leopard (on a g4 powerbook) and it seems that this was the most resent version to get on a g4.. there is a 6.0.7 out which says UB only (my guess was it would be for leopard which is universal binary) so anyway what it should mean is that its intel only... and not at all universal binary... i am pissed off.. do i have to partition my drive and install tiger to get ableton running??
,mr_fisken,2007-12-02T20:54Z,"after draging the ""live"" file to the kellogs program it cant be patched so when I try entering the serial in ableton it wont work and says ""this unlock key looks like it is from different computer""
What can I do to make the patch work?"
,vmango,2007-12-09T08:45Z,"so this won't work on my g4 running leopard? if it will, how do I type out that funny character? alt and 3 doesn't do it"
,movezig1,2007-12-31T04:25Z,"yeah, i have leopard and when i put in the unlock code, i get 
""sorry, this unlock key does not fit your computer's Challenge Code. this unlock key looks like it is for a different computer, or you typed the wrong key.""
so wtf, is there an ableton live crack anywhere for leopard? what's a brother to do... please dont make me use boot camp!"
,DJZobe,2008-01-12T07:18Z,yup had the same prob....the file it told you delete didn't even show up in HD
,ComfortableInClouds,2008-02-21T07:01Z,"Ah man! This copy registration error is terrible! I don't know how they detect that you are using a pirated version. Perhaps a hidden file of some sort that gets updated everytime you connect to the internet? After I got the copy registration erro for version 5.2, I downloaded version 6.07 and it was working fine for hours. Then I quit Ableton and connect to the internet, disconnect from the internet, reopen Ableton and soon after get the copy registration error. Arg! Does anyone know how to solve this copy registration problem? I am certain there is some hidden file that gets installed in your computer that perhaps you'd be able to delete? Or perhaps it's compiled inside of Ableton, so by installing Ableton, the file itself is surreptitiously installed as well. Shady shit. I really want this program! Does anyone have any ideas?"

Use Little Snitch to prevent pirated soft from using inet connection"
,GreyMatters,2008-05-28T00:40Z,"Ok, i just got the Copy Violation Error about the illegal key.  Seems to be an inherent problem, as I was surprised at first that my 5.2 UB was getting busted when 7 has been out for ages it seems.  Although this is how I got my 5.2 back up and running, it might/should work (except for the different serial #'s) for newer and older versions.   This is for Mac, no idea about PC except that you need to clean the registry.

Ableton runs a checksum when you're computer is connected to the internet (must be fairly random b/c I've been running Live for 6 months and I'm always connected via wireless).  Ableton has sneaky Advanced TCP/IP.plist files hidden in the Preferences folder, and they are zero length too.  This is how i got it working again using info from various forums on the web.  Thanks to the genius of Voidet, Entomologist and PUNK-ska I got Live back fully running (and for good!) and hopefully you can too. 

It should be noted that Ableton, when connected to the web, will catch the invalid key if the script is not correctly written.  To be sure you can always disconnect from the web before using Live, but that;s a hassle so the script is a perfect solution.  Following the other steps correctly will get Live up and running again, but it will only be a matter of time before Ableton runs a checksum and finds that its using an invalid key, yet again giving the  Copy Violation Error, crashing Live, and ruining the track you were currently working on.  Locking the ""unlock.cfg"" doesn't work, as it reports an error if you try to save a file.  But if the script is working, then the script will then stay open and every five minutes will call the Unix copy command 'cp' to overwrite 'Unlock.cfg' with the working cracked one, thus for that file defeating any counting/flagging mechanism.  I have it permanently running to re-copy the working cracked 'Unlock.cfg' file every 5 minutes - extremely low CPU usage too.  Make sure you are not connected to the internet.  After its working again, If you load files that have been saved with a (detected) cracked version, it will report back a Copy Violation Error and crash Live.  New files should work fine.

1. First open up Terminal, found in your applications folder/utilities. Type (or copy/paste:

defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles TRUE
killall Finder

*that is two commands*
(this shows all files, including the hidden files, in each folder)

2. Go to your home directory, then click on library, then Preferences.
~/Library/Preferences/

3. Look for a file that looks like ""Advanced TCP:IP 0000blahblahblah.plist"" and delete it.

4. Delete the folder Ableton in the Preferences folder.

5. Go back into Terminal and type (or copy/paste) these two commands:

defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles FALSE
killall Finder

(this hides all the hidden files in each folder again)

******Alternatively to #1-5:
Run Terminal and type: 
cd Library 
cd Preferences 
ls -al   "
,GreyMatters,2008-05-28T00:43Z,"rm ""Advanced TCP/IP.plist""   (or whatever the files name is, to delete these, for as many files there are of that type as necessary, but it should be a maximum of two.  Make sure you have the double quotes for the file name as Unix takes names with spaces as parameters if unquoted).

6. Go to ~/Library/Application Support/Ableton/Live 5.2/Unlock/Unlock.cfg
and delete the file and the Unlock folder.

7. Open Live. The procedure above should have reset your Ableton.  It should ask if you want to proceed in demo mode or enter a valid key. Choose to enter key.
-enter this serial:

4008-7527-B461-5C69-8A88-C075

8. Choose ""Enter unlock code"" and enter the following code (yes, there are strange characters in there):

unlock code found here:
http://forum.funkysouls.com/dump/f65t106012.html

9. To unlock Operator, enter this serial:

A407-7107-A71D-5764-5106-A196

10. Again, select ""Enter unlock code"" and enter the following code:

unlock code found here:
http://forum.funkysouls.com/dump/f65t106012.html

11. There, so Live should now open fine.  A new ""unlock.cfg"" has been input and the dreaded Advanced TCP/IP.plist file(s) has/have been removed.  However, when connected to the net, Live is still susceptible to the Ableton checksum in the future.  

***The only problem at this point will be that any Live files that are infected with the copyright file will not open correctly.  

12.  Somehow the Copy Violation Error checksum also modifies the 'Unlock.cfg' when it saves files, possibly a counter.  I found an Applescript which copies over the 'cracked' Unlock.cfg back in every five minutes, thus resetting it.  The script will stay open and every five minutes will overwrite 'Unlock.cfg' with the cracked working version, thus defeating any counting/flagging mechanism.

13. First of all, make a copy of the original cracked 'Unlock.cfg' file that is working fine to open Live, and paste it to any location other than Ableton's directory (I used my documents folder for simplicity).

14. Open script Editor and enter this:

on idle
tell application ""Finder""
do shell script ""cp '/{PATH TO THE COPY OF UNLOCK.CFG}/Unlock.cfg' '/Users/{YOUR USERNAME}/Library/Application Support/Ableton/Live 5.2/Unlock/Unlock.cfg'""

end tell
return 300   'Application' and set the checkboxes for 'Run Only', 'Stay Open' and if desired 'Startup Screen' (or choose to run script automatically on login, up to you, but I recommend for extra insurance).

15.  Run the script to ensure it works.  Double-click the file where it was saved.  Select ""run,"" and if it doesn't report back any errors but remains open, it should be working properly.

It's worth noting just in case to add to '/etc/hosts/' a line containing this:

127.0.0.1 www.ableton.com

...which will redirect any possible Copy Protection Violation reports away from Ableton's website to the local machine."

Topic:  Copyright Protection Can't Use Live 7 but I Paid!

Tue Mar 25, 2008
User1: "" Since 2 months now I a have a problem with Ableton 7 that I purchased
from the Ableton Website. Everytime I start the Program I get Message from Live saying ''A Copyprotection Violation has been identified. Please
contact...'' and I cant use the program!  I tried reinstalling and installing Live 7.2 with a new Unlock Key and it worked for about 2 weeks. Now again the Message comes and I cant use Live. I tried the same again but it still doesnt work.  Thats really bad since I use Live for producing, djing and many more...
and I paid for the Software! Ableton support doesnt even know what to do and leaves me with the problem.Thats not fair!!!""


User2: ""So what did Ableton support say, specifically?""
User3:  ""A couple of weeks ago I started live after a crash I think and it came up in demo mode!!!!  I had to authorize it again which worked but WTF?

User1:  ""To User2: The support asked me for the serial number, what they can check on my acount all the time if they want Confused
and then they said that I should use the beta version.
But it didnt fix the problem!!!  To User3:  Same here, it happend after a crash and since then its fucked!  I think everyone should know that with Ableton there are many problems like that!""

User4:  ""Im having the same problem. Support gave me a new serial to use after telling me to trash the unlock file and reinstall, which fixed it for a few days. It started happening soon after i started using a plugin called Lucifer by Devine machine. Are you using the same plugin by any chance?""

User5:  ""The same thing happened to me with Live 7.0.3 and 7.0.2 during a basic session. A window poped up Ă  la ""a copy protection violation has been detected"". After some email correspondence with the support I deleted all the preferences and unlocked Live 7 again. Since then it worked without a problem, although i am still feeling very uncomfortable about this whole thing.

The biggest problem is the way the copy protection worked (at least in my case): With the copy protection message coming up the audiostream IMMEDIATELY stopped and there was no way to save the current set. Imagine this to happen during a gig, what a horror. You have to fiddle for over half an hour to get things running again -> a night/business ruined.

This never happend with Live 6 which i am still using to play live. No way i am using Live 7 for live action if Ableton can not guarantee that the copy protection works as it should.""

User4:  ""This also happens on Live 6 im afraid. I was advised by support to do the same ""delete preferences and unlock file, delete and reinstall Live"". The problem returned within an hour. The latest thing i've been told is to reinstall Leopard doing an ""archive and install"" as it might be related to a corrupt user profile. I gig every week so im screwed if this doesn't solve it.

the people its happen to are you all on Mac's? What version OS are you using? I was on 10.5.2 when this was happening. i've since heard there's issues with 10.5.2. Back to 10.5 at the minute. fingers crossed.""

User5:  ""happened with winxp sp2 and live 7.0.3 & 7.0.2

i did swap the cpu 2 months before it happend but neither did i have to reauthorize nor did the the challenge code change so it can't be the cause of the copy protection error."""
