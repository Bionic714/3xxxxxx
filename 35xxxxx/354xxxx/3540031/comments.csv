,taxcut,2006-10-16T13:09Z,"This film suggests that half of Greenland and half of Antarctica is going to melt soon, which will flood all our cities.

This is bogus. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which is more credible than anyone else, has found that the sea-level will increase 110-770 mm (most likely value somewhere in the middle) between 1990 and 2100.

One hundred years ago electricity was unheard of. In another 100 years, who knows what will happen. Maybe we will have complete climate control, or live in module homes that can be moved anywhere. We will most likely have found a different energy source.

Sure there are other, both positive and negative, effects of global warming.

My advice is: don't lose any sleep over it. We have other much more urgent needs right now, such as Darfur. Problems that are also easier and cheaper to fix.

I'm not a USA republican by the way, but Swedish libertarian (almost). I perfectly understand I'm a minority, but maybe someone will rethink their beliefs, or maybe I will hear some really good arguments and change the way I see things.

,jimmychan,2006-10-16T15:22Z,"oh and btw, greenhouse gases, polutants etc have no real affect on the temperature of the planet... its a natural cycle... New evidence has shown the earth was much warmer in centuries past, before they had all these so called 'global warming' gadgets.  For example farming tools found in greenland from 15th centuray, proving it used to be warm up there.  
So yes sadly taxcut is kinda right, live with it....

,NuclearScientist,2006-10-18T00:44Z,"Seriously, you're an idiot!

We have a new alternative energy source named Nuclear Fusion, but it will only be productive enough over 50 years at least! There is just enough oil to last about 30 years, and Uraniuam and plutonium to last 50.000 years. Solar panels won't help, because they cost a lot of energy to build and don't have such a good efficiency. And i'm against windmills because they destroy underwater habitats with the acustic waves they produce in the water.

And don't think about a rise in water level like in waterworld. But even with a small rise New Orleans, The Netherlands and other below sealevel places will disappear because the dams won't be able to hold the pressure. 

And then there is the fact that deserts tend to spread out if temperature increases. So lots of fertile land will disappear and there will be foodshortage!

And don't forget, nature (plants and animals) are the first victims of global warming. 

And like many people said it used to be much hotter on earth thousand years ago and so on...global warming is just a natural fenomena i agree, but the greenhouse effect is an accelerated global warming!

I do think the greenhouse effect is a problem. I do my bit to prevent its acceleration. I know I should not be content with thinking that is enough but its better than nothing.

,oldngrey,2007-10-17T18:16Z,"This film would make a great prestiage if it would tell you the truth about global warming , it's quick flashing scenes and ill begotten music gave me a sense of forboding and doesn't not help to convey a sense of workable energy alternatives, this film made me feel helpless and depresssed. Much of the film is with Al Gore without anyone really backing up his views , it is like a big ego trip.My conclusion is if you want a pure disaster horror film then this is the one for you, but if you want a unbiased view of global temprature change then look to the bbc horizion documentary about global climate change. the nobelprice has lost all of his meaning and prestige since Al Gore got his. If anyone believes that humans causes global warming is either ignorant or having an agenda. Al Gore does have an agenda, look at his new company which buys and sells carbon credits, instant money for nothing.The ""Greener"" religion just doesn't standup to Scientific facts. Al Gore would sell his mother for a little feel good publicity. Alfred Nobel is probably rolling in his grave over what the Nobel prize become. The Nobel Peace Prize had lost it prestige long ago when it was given to Arafat, the father of modern terrorism.

The nine alleged errors in the film
# Mr Gore claims that a sea-level rise of up to 20 feet would be caused by melting of either West Antarctica or Greenland ""in the near future"". The judge said: ""This is distinctly alarmist and part of Mr Gore's ""wake-up call"". He agreed that if Greenland melted it would release this amount of water - ""but only after, and over, millennia"".""The Armageddon scenario he predicts, insofar as it suggests that sea level rises of seven metres might occur in the immediate future, is not in line with the scientific consensus.""

# The film claims that low-lying inhabited Pacific atolls ""are being inundated because of anthropogenic global warming"" but the judge ruled there was no evidence of any evacuation having yet happened.

# The documentary speaks of global warming ""shutting down the Ocean Conveyor"" - the process by which the Gulf Stream is carried over the North Atlantic to western Europe. Citing the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the judge said that it was ""very unlikely"" that the Ocean Conveyor, also known as the Meridional Overturning Circulation, would shut down in the future, though it might slow down.

# Mr Gore claims that two graphs, one plotting a rise in C02 and the other the rise in temperature over a period of 650,000 years, showed ""an exact fit"". The judge said that, although there was general scientific agreement that there was a connection, ""the two graphs do not establish what Mr Gore asserts"".

# Mr Gore says the disappearance of snow on Mt Kilimanjaro was directly attributable to global warming, but the judge ruled that it scientists have not established that the recession of snow on Mt Kilimanjaro is primarily attributable to human-induced climate change.

# The film contends that the drying up of Lake Chad is a prime example of a catastrophic result of global warming but the judge said there was insufficient evidence, and that ""it is apparently considered to be far more likely to result from other factors, such as population increase and over-grazing, and regional climate variability.""

# Mr Gore blames Hurricane Katrina and the consequent devastation in New Orleans on global warming, but the judge ruled there was ""insufficient evidence to show that"".

# Mr Gore cites a scientific study that shows, for the first time, that polar bears were being found after drowning from ""swimming long distances - up to 60 miles - to find the ice"" The judge said: ""The only scientific study that either side before me can find is one which indicates that four polar bears have recently been found drowned because of a storm.""That was not to say there might not in future be drowning-related deaths of bears if the trend of regression of pack ice continued - ""but it plainly does not support Mr Gore's description"".

Citing the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the judge said that it was ""very unlikely"" that the Ocean Conveyor, also known as the Meridional Overturning Circulation, would shut down in the future, though it might slow down.

There is a deep ocean current that circulates southward down from Greenland all the way down to Antarctica and East towards Australia and up and around back Southward and Westerly as the water rises and circulates all the way back to the starting point as warmer ""surface"" water over a period of 1,000 years.

And frankly, I would buy stuff from you company too, if you had scientific decency to mention that the same judge you are so keen of quoting concluded that the major thesis of the film stands and that it is suitable for the in class, school education, if completed with more less dramatical and more scientific evidence.

Then I seen things that said hey, it's a load of crap.  I think calling it climate change is better.  Because it's not just about getting warmer, but actually changing the earths global climate.  There is a group of people that want to tell us, that there is nothing we can do to prevent this from coming to pass and we just need to ride it out. Yes, we have seen warming and cooling patterns in the past. Though none, not a single one has ever been has severe or sustained as the one were in right now. Guess, what is the only thing that has changed since the last one, we are an industrialized world. Scientists aren't alarmed that the climate is getting warmer, its the rate and sustained period that it continues to warm at. People say well 2008 was the coolest since 2000, but it is still on the top ten hottest years since we have began measuring this. My parents and grandparents have told me they dont remember the temps being this hot and summers lasting as long as they do now, or even winters being as warm.  People that think over 6 billion humans on the planet with developed nations rising, have no effect on the climate, just are simply amazing. WTF are you retarded? Though people that make the claim that the earth isn't warming at all amaze me even more so. Hopefully something minor but undeniably irrefutable will happen that will be proof of this, before it is too late. Some people need to open their eyes and realize, we can do something and we dont have to give up our lives or money in doing so, just a change from where we get our energy and do with our waste."

,roadpizza,2012-03-12T11:40Z,"regardless of the quality of this film, climate change deniers are simpletons who distrust science because frankly, they don't understand it, thus lack the ability to double check the work of scientists.  Either that, or they're blinded by dollar signs, and incapable of admitting that what makes them money, is also bad for the environment.  I think it's hilarious that people take a political stance on this, like the verdict on science is still ""out there"" or some retarded bullshit excuse like that.  If you can't understand how infrared works, then don't try and say that global warming is a scam.  Stop trying to argue with thermometers. "
