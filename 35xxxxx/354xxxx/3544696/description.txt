Unida\\\'s first album is an epic tribute to Garcia\\\'s roots the way Spielberg\\\'s films are tributes to his own childhood. Their second album, The Great Divide (2001), got shelved due to company partner, Island/Def Jam, not seeing any potential in the album. As usual, the suits couldn\\\'t have been more wrong. This album blows anything that\\\'s been released in the last 6-7 years out of the water.
