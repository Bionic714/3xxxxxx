With GetSmile you can capture almost every smilie from the Internet and add it to your collection.
We distribute with GetSmile a free sample ready to use smilie collection containing more than 800 smilies!
You can create and distribute your own smilie collections.
GetSmile code is specially optimized to simultaneously output hundreds of animated smilies. Even the most popular browsers cannot do that (well, they are not designed to be powerful smilie managers though ;)!
The entire concept of the program's interface has one purpose - to make smilie management as easy as possible.
