,abbedabb,2007-08-12T14:53Z,"The crack doesn't work for me.
At first I can only choose ""30 days trial"" or ""register"", but after using the crack I can only choose ""register"", but I need a name and serial."
,s1croc,2007-10-17T00:57Z,Did anyone figure out how to use the crack?
,daffiex3,2007-11-21T12:36Z,"Works Perfect THNX!
all u have to do is install the trial version then copy and paste the crack in the ""Inspiration"" folder in Program Files(or where u installed it) then run the crack and click patch and it should be successful. JUST MAKE SURE THAT U DONT HAVE THE PROGRAM RUNNING WHILE U PUT THE CRACK OR EALSE YOU WILL RECIEVE A MESSAGE SAYING ERROR PATCHING. Enjoy!"

,Bat2001,2008-04-01T14:52Z,When it asks for serial number write anything you like. It does not seem to matter! Great Torrent THANKS!!
,georgs_town,2008-04-04T01:46Z,"am i just to stupid to get it??
i did as you said, but there's only one file (Insp8.exe) i can choose to crack, but when i try that it says ""error opening file"". which file do i have to select to crack? or what else do i do wrong?

,ferretboy425,2008-04-27T16:20Z,"great torrent :D drag the crack into the inspiration folder ( not the trial folder ) and run it, worked perfectly for me, like bat2001 said write your name and any random serial number and it will work, just close the pop up it gives you, keep up the good work the3rdguy"
,ferretboy425,2008-04-27T20:06Z,"also, how do you make that song for the crack? its catchy lol"
,scarbs,2008-05-31T12:03Z,"Demo didn't install!
Downloaded new demo from Inspiration Website but this is now suffxed with IE so it now reads 'INSP8IE'.

Any ideas here?"
,scarbs,2008-05-31T15:48Z,"I have worked out what happened.

I run Vista.  I changed the install path the the root of c: instead of Program Files.

Success"
