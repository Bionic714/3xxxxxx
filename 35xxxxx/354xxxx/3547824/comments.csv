this is the biggest disappointment 'comeback album' in years. other than the familiar scratchy vocals, guitar filters and awesome songwriting, this album is not recognizable as the who. not as they have been known in years gone by.
true, pete and roger have gotten up there in dog years, but the album should come warning who fans of its soft, almost country feel."
