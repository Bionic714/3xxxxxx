Help anyone.

/G"
,Gotlandix,2006-10-26T21:12Z,"I managed to get explorer to not terminate by doing:

1) Open a command window (Start->Run, type in 'cmd' hit enter)
2) Remove image preview, type and hit enter regsvr32 /u shimgvw.dll
3) Remove media preview, type and hit enter regsvr32 /u shmedia.dll 

But media player still terminates."
,andre321,2006-10-26T21:18Z,i fixed the explorer.exe error by renaming from .avi to .xvid :P
,GhostZ,2006-10-27T18:11Z,Is the sound off or not?
,webslave,2006-10-29T00:06Z,"If you feel annoyed about .avi, I've got a great tip for you. There's a media player called VLC that enables you to play video directly from the avi file without any unpacking whatsoever. Works great, and you can seed on without deleting the avi files. Recommended."
,access88,2006-10-31T04:59Z,Man Ive downloaded the torrent but i get 22 diferente files and i can't see any one except the sample video how can I fix this
,sebzapata,2007-03-14T00:42Z,"i have downloaded this video and several other videos and tv shows and none of them seem to play, this has only happened in the last 2 or 3 days. it is not the video because old videos which used to play, most of these dont play any more. i use power dvd to play my videos normally but i have WMP and several other video players."
,sebzapata,2007-03-15T23:22Z,"access88, you need to extract the largest winrar file and that conatains the video. i dont think you can just download that winrar file because i tried that and it didnt work."
