,bigdrbrain2006,2006-10-18T18:00Z,"if you own a modded xbox or dont want to pay for xbox-live you are also able to play online for free!
get XLink Kai at http://www.teamxlink.co.uk/ set it up (available for many OSes and quite easy) and play!"
,surfarn,2006-10-20T23:31Z,Thanks!!
,Articuno,2006-10-25T12:41Z,"Do you need a modded Xbox or does an ordinary Xbox handles this?

Thx, anyway."
,bigdrbrain2006,2006-10-25T21:56Z,"XLink does not depend on your Xbox. You can use either a modded or an ordinary Xbox.

By the way: XLink works with other platforms, too. It is possible to use it with your Xbox, PS2, Gamecube, PSP (and Xbox360 soon)."
,Jesusv06,2006-12-19T02:07Z,"Thanx for the upload!!  but what do you mean by plus update 1.1? does it update your xbox?  if so could that be bad if you have softmod?  could this maps mess up your softmod?   by the way you should get a faster connection, im downloading at .5 kb/s and it will take me a month!! :(  and no its not my connection, mines pretty decent i got cumcast =]  "

C'mon i know you guys got it to work 253 ppl have downloaded this cant anyone tell me how to fix this??
,bigdrbrain2006,2006-12-24T21:47Z,"Hi Jesusv06! Try to delete the folder E:/TDATA/4d530064 which causes also the loss of your Halo 2 savegames. 
If nothing helps a simple solution would be to erase the UDATA and TDATA folders if you havent any savegames or settings you want to lose. Then, after having started Halo 2 at least once, do the Update and Map Pack installation following the description exactly."
,Jesusv06,2006-12-27T01:47Z,I did delete the E:/TDATA/4d530064 folder and the complete TDATA folder. But i have yet to delete the UDATA one.  One thing i noticed using Qwix was that your iso is in PAL format. I have an xbox with NTSC region so thats where my problem occurs. It would had saved me a lot of time and frustration if you had mention if it was PAL in your description. As for gettin my Halo 2 copy to run i havent been able to. However I notice Killtrocity v2 still runs on my xbox so i took the iso apart and put default maps in it and got a Halo 2 hybrid...but with no campaign option.... I guess not everythin that you get for free works like you want it to...
,Bolbey,2007-02-03T20:07Z,"So i need to link my Xbox to my computer and arrange some files for this to work? I can just burn this on dvd, put it in and it installs the maps?"

Question: Do you need to install Auto-Update if you don't use XBL?"
