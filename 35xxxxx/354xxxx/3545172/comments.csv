,Flatskjerm,2007-01-01T22:35Z,"""""Don't bother downloading this, it doesn't have any of the radio stations or any audio during cutscenes. Just download a full .ISO instead.""""

Correct, but you dont need the radio or cutscene audio to play.
Just put in youre music in the radio."
,bobbyg2,2007-01-04T04:59Z,This is pretty cool. A definate solution for y'all with dial-up. It took me 1.5 days to download this and it was well worth the wait. I have been busy playing MTA with it with no problems. You should definately consider this if you have dial-up and yo don't wana wait over a week to download a 1.46GB file. Thanks Flatskjerm for uploading us this game. It was very kind of ya! :D
,Bottlenecks,2007-01-10T21:02Z,do any1 know any good zip unpacking devices??
,Bottlenecks,2007-01-10T21:38Z,"i downloaded it, and everything went smoothly, and then I unzip it with winrar and it just flashes on the screen, and when i try to run the file (thecuda something something) nothing happends. this is not a shitty file, i suspect more of a faulty download but i really would appreciate all the help i can get."
,Bottlenecks,2007-01-10T21:42Z,"now i am starting (i hope) to get it
all you need to do is to double click on the unpak.bak file you get when you unzip it"
,KolanSki,2007-01-10T22:09Z,"Heey nu har ja laddat ner den o jag har fått upp alla filer som den innehåller.
när jag öppnar
unpak filen står det att jag ska trycka på valfriknapp o sen stängs den ner??

,duhrealmaster,2007-01-23T00:20Z,"bobbyg2, or anyone, how did you get MTA to work? When I run the client It says that my .exe version is unknown, which is common when you don't own the real game and all the nocd things I try to update the patch don't work because this isn't an iso. help?"
,Skater_her,2007-01-27T21:46Z,"Can someone please seed??

,alx2951,2007-04-22T14:47Z,"Hei
Hvorfor kommer det ikke noe lyd?"
,Flatskjerm,2007-04-28T22:59Z,"Instralerte du det slik den dritten på side 2 sa? 
Hvis ikke så er det litt merklig altså, siden det skulle komme lyd altså."
,Flatskjerm,2007-04-28T23:14Z,"OO, i really wanna thank all of you who seeds this torrent (L)

It did only take 15 min to download "
,alx2951,2007-05-01T20:42Z,"jeg tror jeg skal ha instalert den riktig, har gjort det samme på en data med xp home og der funket det fint.
Tror kanskje det er på grun av os'n min.
Kom opp en feilmelding når jeg kjørte unpack om at det ikke funka med 64bits versioner, og jeg har vista ultimate 64bitters"
,Evimogwai,2007-05-04T16:36Z,"Great download speed and works awesome.

Just a warning to the fans, it doesn't have any sound for the movies or radio stations.

The normal dialogue (the one that get's subtitles) works great though"
,metallicafani,2007-05-04T17:59Z,Why sounds is not working??
,Theman-man,2007-05-09T14:21Z,"how did you make it so small file plz can you tell me beacause i have the radio station and they work fine and the other people how downloaded this game will be thx full

,Flatskjerm,2007-05-16T16:24Z,"I used uharc (a compressing program)
Takes long time to compress things, but it makes the files much smaler than winrar and other programs"

,apegomp,2007-06-25T00:43Z,"Flatskjerm! Jeg tror grunnen til at noen ikke får lyd i spillet, er fordi de avslutter Unpack.bat før dekomprimeringa er blitt 100% ferdig! Jeg gjorde den samme feilen, jeg kjørte Unpack.bat og så jeg at vinduet var svart, så jeg trodde at dekomprimeringa var ferdig, så jeg avsluttet før komprimeringa blei ferdig uten at jeg visste det, og så starta jeg spillet, det funka, men det sto ""no audio hardware found"" elns.. så jeg installerte det igjen uten å avslutte unpack.bat og det funka.."
,jasperik,2007-06-27T01:29Z,"hey thanks man  now i finaly got VC ...
its been a whila though since i DLed but still cool game.
i modded it so much you will only see that its VC by the map....thats the only thing that didnt change in the game."
,Takster,2007-08-09T11:48Z,"Flatskjerm, Thanks.

All you other people complaining, what a bunch of bitches, go download the full .iso or buy the game and then shut the fuck up. This is a perfect release, seen as i dont give a shit about cutscenes and crappy 80's music. 

20 minutes to download and ppl still complain..."
