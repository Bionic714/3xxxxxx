Reseed of Superfetch.

Superfetch is a tiny program that makes it easier to download files from the net.
It makes use of the clipboard, so you basically copy an URL that goes to a file 
on a webbserver and Superfetch handles the rest. When you copy a URL it ques up 
in a downloadlist so you can theoretically copy 10 URLs/second.

Superfetch handles:
- single clipboardURLs
- single/dual instances of fuskertags
- bitmapcompiling
- copied text
- automatic updates
