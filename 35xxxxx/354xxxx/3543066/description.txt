The trailer for our new snowkitefilm,"Entropy"

Entropy promises to break new ground by showcasing the talents of the world's premiere newschool snowkiters.

The film was shot entirely in High Definition during the winter season of 2005/05, in Norway, France, Italy, Sweden, Finland and USA.

Featured riders are Bjorn Kaupang (F-One) and AG Dokken (Ozone) on skis as well as Claes Lundin (Cabrinha), Remi Meum (Slingshot) and Sigve Botnen (Ozone) on snowboard. These riders are at the very cutting edge of snowkiting's new-school revolution, stomping everything from huge kiteloops to technical handlepasses.

Entropy will available to buy in PAL and NTSC format DVD as well as Windows Media High Definition on October 23rd. (Date is subject to change)
