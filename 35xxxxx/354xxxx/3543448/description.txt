From the web;
Nia Vardalos delighted audiences with her personally scripted blockbuster 
MY BIG FAT GREEK WEDDING. The movie inspired this short-lived sitcom. 
This sitcom starring the Canadian-Greek comedienne premiered on CBS on February 24,2003. 
She is Nia Portakolos married to Ian,an all-American man(Steven Eckholdt). John Corbett,
who played Ian in the film already had a show of his own,HBO's recently cancelled 
"Sex In The City",so he contractually could not do MBFGL. Also part of the TV cast 
who also appeared in the film are Gia Carides as Nia's sister,Michael Constantine 
as the father and Lainie Kazan as the mother. In every episode there are several 
flashbacks to Nia's childhood with her much younger mom and dad. Rita Wilson served 
as executive producer as she did for the movie. In addition to Wilson,other memorable 
guest appearances were made by Joey Fatone of the singing group NSync,who also appeared 
in the film as Angelo,and Frank Stallone,who's Sylvester's brother. After 6 or 7 episodes,
CBS pulled the plug on this sitcom.
