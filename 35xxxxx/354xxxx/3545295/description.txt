Plot Summary: "Reza is a petty thief who escapes jail by posing as a mullah. When he has to stay in disguise longer than he expected, he accidentally becomes the revered leader of a small-town mosque, bringing people flooding in with his on the hoof sermons featuring sexual innuendo and references to 'brother' Tarantino\'s Pulp Fiction."

This is most probably one of the most famous recent Iranian movies (in Iran), as it was both critically acclaimed and loved by mainstream audience. It kept going in and out of theatres, as it kept getting banned and then had the ban lifted, and then banned again, and ban lifted again, and so forth. It never actually insults Islam, but it pushes boundaries by shedding a different light on Islam. 

The movie I ripped, unfortunatly, isn't the best of qualities, but it is not bad. 

Subtitles are included in the movie itself.
