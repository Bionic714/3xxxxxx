,DVDguy,2006-11-02T18:38Z,Dickie:   Check this link out  :  http://btfaq.com/serve/cache/56.html
[T],deathmule,2006-11-02T20:25Z," ill see what i can do about the subs. i dont speek swedish, so i wont know if the subs are right or not"
,emange,2006-11-02T23:26Z,Seed! FFS!
,JohnDeer,2006-11-03T11:04Z,Is this the whole dvd or is it just a fix...
,trickydickie,2006-11-03T11:11Z,THANKS DVD GUY
,DVDguy,2006-11-03T13:47Z,"Dickie:  NP. It's not that hard really.  Just a couple steps. Take your time learning, and it will not be long before you are an expert!!  Will keep an eye open for your first torrent!"
,DVDguy,2006-11-03T14:31Z,"Watched a couple of minutes (Haven't checked the end for the audio fix ... want to watch the movie)

Screener for sure. Little Deathmule intro.

My concern:  the 16x9 seems pretty off. Really narrow on my wide screen.  Not sure what it will look like on a 4:3.  Those with Wide Screen TV's will have to play with the aspect ratio on their TV."

,dabolaa,2006-11-03T14:49Z,thank you   you the best
,mh99hojo,2006-11-03T19:05Z,Definetly not a screener. (Using the definition of screener=DVD quality made for awards consideration etc.). Looks like a good TC (telecine) if you ask me.
,suckmyballs,2006-11-03T19:11Z,You wanna Rat DVD full DVD's with menus It takes it down  to about 800meg and expands into 4.6GB it's Gr8!!!

,eanderse,2006-11-04T10:05Z,Thanx a bunch deathmule! qlty is xlnt!!
,emange,2006-11-04T12:31Z,The Audio seems to be in sync but why is it in this weird aspect format?.Its not 16:9 or 4:3 its like 1/3 of 16:9.
,emange,2006-11-04T12:41Z,"What the fuck has happened to the scene Pukka and Dope gives us these out of sync copies pirates of the caribbean and The Departed.
This One maybe in sync but the picture is reduced to a 3inch screen.Deathmule why did you have to fuck the aspect ratio upp?"

you know what buddy, if you can do better i would love to see it. i coverted it into 16:9. now since i did NOT make the avi. that means Pukka fucked up the raidos. now if you dont like it, feel free to download one of the DVDs that are out of sync. stop being a ungrateful little prick!!"
,supersnick,2006-11-05T00:05Z,"Thanks a lot! Just watched it, and the quality was very good. Don`t listen to the fuckers complaining :-)"
,goodtoshare,2006-11-05T13:39Z,"deathmule,

What you've done here is create a nice watchable version of this release, and I thank you for that.

A lot of the major releases these days are out of sync.  Do you plan to continue to fix up new releases in the future?  I hope that you do."

,vinlmonkey,2006-11-14T11:56Z,"perfectly good movie....Deathmule. And I mean perfect.

I dont make 'em I just download 'em. I dont know much.... but I know that I watch the film last night, and there was sweet fa wrong with anything. I didnt need to measure the screen, or adjust the sound. So really dont know why all these comments are not just thank you deathmule, for your time and trouble. Excellent.  thanks again"
,albert009,2006-11-14T20:01Z,"Thanks deathmule for the very good film, although the size is smaller than usual but it is still very clear and enjoyable"
[T],deathmule,2006-11-14T23:58Z,i apresat everyone who poped in to say thanks. i dont understand why people talk shit. they act like im charging people to dowload this.
,East Lansing,2006-11-15T17:44Z,I watched a few minutes and the sound was in sync and pic quality was ok - more than I can say for every other version of The Departed I've seen so far.  THANKS to the MULE of DEATH
,cheddarbob,2006-11-26T07:59Z,"Is this in NTSC or PAL?

My DVD player is picky"
,ciantic,2006-11-26T20:23Z,"Yeah, nice release, but one huge logical error there is, why on earth didn't you *just* fix the orginal release and leave the files alone, why did you also changed it to DVD format? If the image is correct then you don't change it.

Now it is rather useless, adding subtitles is more than pain and the image and colors does not look even close to what it was in XViD release.

Playing it is also pain, mplayer has hardtime playing these kind of DVDs without burning them."
