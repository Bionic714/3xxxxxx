,Not.SlyPee,2006-10-29T18:25Z,"And one thing,there has to be:

Replace C:\...\TSBIN\SIMS2SP4.EXE file with this crack.

\...\ means your install directory.

REPEAT: DO NOT! IT SUCK'S!!"
,Not.SlyPee,2006-11-08T15:01Z,why?Please more constructive criticism if u have any.
,FerretsG2,2006-11-11T02:11Z,"This worked great for me, apart from some minor slowdown on the intro movies (I skip those anyways) I really appreciate you doing this, the only reason I can think of that it doesn't work is that  people can't figure out the instructions for whatever reason. Try placing the file into:
C:\Program Files\EA GAMES\The Sims 2 Pets\TSBin
this is the default install directory, if you installed it elsewhere, then look wherever you installed it"
,Not.SlyPee,2006-11-11T13:08Z,"Thanks,maybe now they will get the point"
,yunin,2006-12-03T03:37Z,"I placed the file in C:\Program Files\EA GAMES\The Sims 2 Pets\TSBin. Everytime I click the icon, a new window pops up with no text, but has a red X. I can't get it to work. Is there something I'm doing wrong?"
,Kurare,2006-12-06T20:38Z,Yunin: same for me... suckyness...

,jlorren,2006-12-28T22:34Z,Everytime I try to download this its done before it has time to even begin and does nothing?

,TheBoxNinja,2007-09-15T15:05Z,"Alright people, this Crack works for me :). I can play the game fine. The crack i used to have would sometimes freeze the game and i would have to reboot my computer.

For the people that don't know where ""C:\\...\\TSBIN\\SIMS2SP4.EXE"" is. Its in ""C:\Program Files\EA GAMES\The Sims 2\pets\TSBin"""
,xmalii,2007-12-28T00:39Z,"eehhmmm...

Please help!!"
,xxgindaxx,2008-04-22T02:22Z,"ok so anyone having the same problem as me.. the crack works fine and when i get into the game i cant enter a lot, family or create a family just closes it self after loading for 10 min and comes up with a box saying the game has crashed .. help appreciated x"
,aquateenhungerforce,2008-05-02T07:53Z,"Hey, this probably would work for me because I've tried all the TSBINs (I have more than one, which may not be normal, because I installed the Sims 2 Double Deluxe [bought it]), and it seems like it would install, but then it gives me the message that the files have been corrupted during installation and to re-install.  What?  I even tried this with another Sims 2 Pets crack and it did the same thing.  I tried replacing SIMS2SP4.EXE with it and also tried it without getting rid of SIMS2SP4.EXE.  Kinda stuck now.  Also I'm running Windows Vista.  Thx for any help."
,Jeepeh,2008-07-17T11:23Z,work perfect thanks
,missie2000,2008-08-01T23:42Z,"it just come a X???

,rusty559,2008-08-12T21:13Z,"ive downloaded all no-cd cracks, but everytime i try to start the game it either asks me to make sure the sims pets disk is in (and it is mounted) or  after the openng scene ends, i get a red X error box that has no text, just an ok button
WTF is happening????
it does the same with my Business Ep
and btw i bought the sims 2, its not cracked and i use the CDs for it."
,Nikebk,2008-08-14T12:21Z,Nice
,ShinodasGuard,2008-10-01T14:50Z,Just one thing to say:How can there be a TSBIN//Sims2ep4.exe if we didn't even install the game itself?? you must have forgoten one file to put in the torrent
,Genesis3750,2008-11-13T02:53Z,"ShinodasGuard, this is only the cracked .exe file used to be able to play the game without the actual CD.

And for all of you, please download the full game somewhere else and replace the original Sims2SP4.exe file in the location (C: > Program Files > EA GAMES > Sims 2 Pets > TSBin) with this one..

Works great!! Thanks Not.SlyPee"
,GlennMaistro,2009-01-23T16:02Z,you copy the file and paste it in the programfile/sims2 pets. then you get a question. if you want to replace the file .... then click yes... easy ! :P
,Numlocq,2009-04-01T01:23Z,"Stop complaining that it doesn't work. It quite clearly says ""Sims 2 Pets NO-CD Crack"" It doesn't say it has the installation files. It is just the no cd crack. Read things before you download them"
,idep16,2009-04-19T20:54Z,"this ius only a crack, u have to download sims 2 pets and then copy this crack into the game."
,Teh_Snake,2009-06-11T01:25Z,"Works, Thnx!"
,terminator402,2010-05-01T17:48Z,"Too all of you who dont know how to use this crack.
You need to enter the ""the sims 2 pets"" folder, then the TSBin folder. Replace the sims 2 exe file within that folder, eiter ""cut"" and paste the old file in backup-folder, or just delete it. Then you paste in the crack.
Now you can enjoy the game. 
Good luck!"
,LastHopes,2011-09-25T10:19Z,awesome!! works perfectly!! SUCKERS!!!
