My thoughts: A teenage girl whose relationship with her father is deterioratad one day after another
as her mother is hospitalised for cancer. One day while cleaning her mother\'s room, she finds an unsent letter designated to a man.
Is this her mother\'s first love? The girl is off to look for the man. 

This movie is absolutely beautiful, the flow of the story is very pleasant.
Hiroyuki Sanada is featured in the film, he plays a good-for-nothing convincingly.
Acting from Rena Tanaka is top notch who happens to be one of my very favourites japanese actress who can actually act. She is prolly the best actress in her generation!
This is one of the best coming of age films, I just love this film! Joe Hisaishi\'s music is perfect for the film! I just don\'t find any flaws in this film as more japanese dramas are headin 
toward art house films which is beyond my comprehension. Nevertheless, the film is a must-see for drama fans! I remember after seeing this film I craved for more japanese dramas!
