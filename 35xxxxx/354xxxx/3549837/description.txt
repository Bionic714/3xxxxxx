-The audio on these DVD's are...let's say poorly produced? I think Magnolia studios needs to hire a 
new Audio Technician, lol. It's not horrible, but don't expect 5.1 Dual Channel Dolby quality or anything, 
and it doesn't have anything to do my compression methods as the quality on the shipped DVD's is what 
I'm reffering to here. Hopefully they'll get it right for Season Two.

-Burn the ISO with your burning program of choice (if you don't have one I recommend: http://www.torrentspy.com/torrent/854630/Roxio_Easy_Media_Creator_9)

-You can try mounting if you want. I tried with PowerISO and Daemon, but it only worked about 40% of the 
time.
