Classic PC games - 2002

A definite must 4 all old gamers out there. I promised it long ago, but the organising took much more time than I thought. Now it's done. Enjoy them...


U may need DOSBox or VDMSound to play the games:

DOSBox

VDMSound

P.S.: Please remember to seed, 'cause my upload is poor...
