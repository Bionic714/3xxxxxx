,noisy_mouse,2007-01-08T18:37Z,"Be advised: some kind of corruption with episode 5 (the girl in the fireplace) has dropped enough frames that one entire (and important) line is cut completely from the end of the episode.

I did redownload and check my own file for corruptions, so I'm fairly certain it's a problem with the original file and not just corruption on my end. You may wish to grab this episode from a different torrent."

,viperr,2007-04-06T13:19Z,seed for me plsss i`m downloading 4 days and i`m 34.3% i`m downloading with 8 k seed :) 
,elnomdeguerre,2007-04-30T15:45Z,"please seed! I really want to watch this, I hope some good souls out there will seed this, it's very slow right now. please, please, please !!! :)"
,oilovemeo,2008-03-16T17:49Z,"Please someone seed! It's really slow rigth now, 0k/s!
somebody? :)"
,humanisfilth,2008-08-23T19:01Z,WHY is this download so SLOW?!  73 Seeders and less than 100kB/s????  I'm presently only hooked to 20 seeds and over HALF have a download speed of ZERO!  If you're going to seed then please SEED.  At this point I've upped twice more than I've downloaded...c'mon guys...you're better than this.
,tinny112,2008-08-24T12:05Z,Nice upload. Good quality. 
,Lord-Darkstorn,2010-04-30T04:53Z,How's the quality?
,silentbob515,2010-06-08T20:42Z,Guyz do u remember times when u have only 64kb modem with 5mb upload speed?No?Well this torrent is exactly from these times!
,silentbob515,2010-06-08T20:55Z,"That mean u will seed like motherfuckers (or u can use another style,feel free to seed like super heroes etc.) until u seed whole season out....5.12 GB exactly.If u are lucky same as me,u will be able watch episode 1-4.Then my patience run out,cut this shit and download rest from rapid.

In other hand quality is fairly good. "
,PiratesForTheWin,2010-09-13T18:10Z,"Is anyone else having or had trouble opening the torrent? I'm using vuze, it's giving me an ""Error 503 Service Unavailable"" ... from reading the comments though it doesn't seem like anyone's havin a problem. What gives!"
