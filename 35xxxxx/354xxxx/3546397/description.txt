UFO: Enemy Unknown
X-COM: Terror From The Deep
X-COM: Apocalypse

These three games are some of the best ever made IMO and I bet you agree with me if you have played any of them.

They are all old DOS-games and as such runs best on the platforms they were intended to be played on (that is to say a 486DX2-66 running MS-DOS 6.22 would be perfect for XCOM1&2 and a Pentium 166 or 200 would be preferable for XCOM3) but you might have success using DOSBox or similar with newer computers running Windows XP (I havent tried that myself).

Enjoy!
