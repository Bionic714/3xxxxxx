,skif dank,2010-01-05T03:00Z,"dosbox and emulators suck, just dual boot your damn computer with a 1 gig dos6.22/wfw3.11 partition so you can play all you want and it will actually work. lazy new-tech-fags. "
,NeonRage,2010-05-14T08:24Z,"Skif Dank, why don't you go to hell, okay? If you knew anything about new-age technology, you would know that most computers nowadays are INCOMPATIBLE with DOS, mainly because the vast majority are now coming installed with Vista on them. The vast majority are also unable to have XP installed on them because for some idiotic reason unbeknownst to us, they have removed the compatibility for XP. Great torrent, btw."
,NeonRage,2010-05-14T08:25Z,"Oh, by the way Dank, quit being such a ""Holier than thou"" fag. Okay?"

I would appreciate if anyone could tell me what to do, thx in advance :)"

,synchro_w,2012-02-06T05:13Z,"played 1st 2 of these games to completion when they came out. poss best games of their period. i have winxp pro and i have run dos based games [wo sound] but not been able to get win95-98SE based games to run. since win7 is designed to run in 'winXP' mode i'm sure there is a simple way to run these [tbph, the sound on them isn't that great, maybe 3rd is ok but 1 & 2's sound are like zx spectrum!]. i lost a gf to first 2 games!!! never went to bed for 9 months! had 'qwerty' imprinted on my forehead from sleeping at the kb!"
