,rowborough,2007-01-18T21:40Z,"this cant be original the original release didnt have 5:1 sound it was stereo only?

it also wasnt 16:9 that wasnt even invented in 74.

it should be Dolby stereo with 1.85:1 pic, get the real deel not a remaster, why must everyone try to improve on clasic films. bit like re releasing old viynal (cleaned up and improved ) on CD .

A few pops and hisses makes it real !!!!!!!"

You are right. DVDs were not even invented in 1974. 

Seriously, if you want the real thing, go to the cinema. No DVD will give full satisfaction. But great storytelling like this survives the transfer to digital, like great vinyl albums are still great on CD. Even if they are not the original. 

But some people are so obsessed with originality that they can not love anyone but their own mother."
