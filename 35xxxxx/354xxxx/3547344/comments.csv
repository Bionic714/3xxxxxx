,div2div,2007-01-31T05:49Z,"Hi, there, I've got a question: Why can't I download more than 70,5% just like many other leechers I observe. I upload (unfortunately at night only because of traffic restrictions) without limiting the upload speed. Uploaded more than downloaded, but only upload continues since download had reached 70,5%. Could you please explain why? Thanx, Igor"
,fabbe1,2007-02-10T10:34Z,"I´ve got the same problem. Stops at 70.5% like most of the other leechers while a few seems to be able to continue.
Any idea why??"
,fuzzych,2007-02-11T19:41Z,"seed, please - only 70% :((("
,drewe,2007-02-23T11:34Z,"Please seed

Need another 29 % like many more"
,div2div,2007-02-26T21:38Z,"They have simply used a number of people to give out 70.5% and then allow downloading for their own IP range owners 38.100.25...... only. Therefore, they simply ""suck our blood"" and every seed from that range just disappears after 100%. I see 28 seeds in swarm but not a single kb downloaded in about two months already. 

To Hajime: 
Could you PLEASE SEED OR RESEED and give us the possibility to get 100%. Thanks"
,smartass69,2007-03-17T19:40Z,"heyy everyone, there´s no seeders MY SOFTWARE SAYS, where the #$$% are they?

Stuck on 70,5% Could anyone tell us how to connect to those 35 seeders? Is see some 97% guys but they do not upload"
