,ErnieMcCracken,2007-01-21T13:17Z,"Really cool!!! Did not know this was ever exported to the Arabic world.

I use to watch it in French as a child... I love this, always will. Too bad I don't understand Arabic.

Grendizer (Goldorak) was my hero for a long time.

,bicho911,2007-07-16T05:50Z,Guys plz seed. I would love to download this torrent.
,Grandizer,2007-07-31T18:38Z,"Thanks for the torrent. They do indeed work.

For reference, these are about VHS quality. They look like rips from the older tapes so the quality isnt the best. I am currently trying to get a hold of the Japanese or French DVD's and if that happens I will try to get a higher quality version of this up and running using the Arabic dubbing from this one. If anyone knows how to get a hold of the English subs that would make a great addition to it as well. Just leave the info here on this torrent if you can get a hold of them."
,Grandizer,2007-08-08T01:45Z,"I wanted to add a quick update here. 

1st I have had no luck finding english subs for this anime so once again if anyone knows where to find those please place some information here.

2nd several of the files in this torrent are pretty messed up. I quickly tested up to ep38 and found that the following files has some serious problems with skipping. I am unsure if this is due to the source they were taken from or if it happened during encoding. If the author can check that and let me know if they can be fixed that would be appreciated. The bad episodes include #'s : 

28, 29, 31, 32, 37, & 38

Again I only checked up to 38 so I will post here if I find any more bad episodes. If worst comes to worst I can still rip the audio from my own ancient VHS tapes through the sound card.

Thanks again."

,fadi299,2008-11-10T13:19Z,"thanks themanalaa for this amazing torrent, grendizer is hands down the best anime show i've ever seen and this is coming from a hardcore anime fan....however, as someone said here some episodes are messed up and the quality is kinda poor, so for collectors and fans i recommend downloading the HQ episodes from hqanime4arab.com!.....these episodes are ripped from the DVD release, i've already downloaded the first 20 episodes and i'm currently downloading the 21-74 episodes, great quality and sound but it's in arabic......if you're an anime or mecha fan, this is a must download, transformers can't hold a candle for this amazing show........"

,blackjackel,2009-02-22T07:52Z,"OH SNAP!!! this is just GANGSTER .... FIRE man FIRE!!!

I grew up watching this shit in the middle east and watched it in Arabic, there was even a local dialect dubbed version with really hillbilly sounding arabs made me laugh so hard.... check youtube for that version.

Man, this really brings back memories.

Now we just need to upload the smurfs in arabic and I'll be set for childhood memories."
