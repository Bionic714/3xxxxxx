Denis Leary\'s firefighter series, Rescue Me, is characterized by its delicate balance of brawn and sentiment. 

This CD, which collects tunes that have appeared in the first three seasons, reflects that balance, careening from the full-on rock & roll of the Von Bondies (their \"C\'mon C\'mon\" is the show\'s theme) and the Subways (\"Oh Yeah\") to the pensive, rootsy vibe of Ray Lamontagne (\"All the Wild Horses\") and the Devlins (\"Love Is Blindness\").
