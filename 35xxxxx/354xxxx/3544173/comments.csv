Dear Jim,

Thank you for your posts very much!
They are the only way to get these 5 Beavis & Butt-Head's DVDs in the inet now,
but there is 1 leecher only and no seeds. This leecher is me....

Please kindly seed these discs for me:
1. Work Sucks! / The Final Judgement
2. Troubled Youth / Feel Our Pain
3. Law-Abiding Citizens / There Goes the Neighbourhood
4. Hard Cash
5. Innocence Lost / Chicks n' Stuff

And what about the 6th disc - Beavis & Butt-Head Do Christmas / Butt-O-Ween?
Is it possible to add it to your posts too?

Thank you and thank all in advance!!!
