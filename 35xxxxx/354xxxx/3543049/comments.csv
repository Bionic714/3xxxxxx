,the maverick,2007-01-14T17:55Z,"only maps to work with TT5 & 6 are v660.1223. If you require a keygen, there are plenty on the this site. I know it works with TT One as this is where it is from. Most uptodate Europe Map is 660.1256, but this is not for TT5, but has Isle of Man and whole of Ireland with many road changes. It will work on all GO as well"
