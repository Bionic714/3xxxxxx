     A lifetime in the making (and a year or two or actual production),
     \"I am the Fire\" is the full-length debut release by The Idealist,
     a Swedish musician with a penchant for the subversive side of
     atmospheric noise. This 6-track album is a through-the-keyhole
     (earhole?) look at the mind of a man who lives, breathes and
     dreams of sounds with an organic feel but an electronic bite.

     Joachim Nordwall (b. 1975, Karlskrona, Sweden), The Idealist,
     began his experiments in sound as a young boy. In 1987, he formed
     the Alvars Orkester with Jan Svensson, in which they mixed
     electronic sound with an interest in psychic broadcasting. He was
     particularly active within the independent music scene of the
     1980s and 90s, releasing work through the B├╢rft Records label.
     After a brief hiatus, Alvars Orkester has recently (January 2006)
     released the \"Interference\" album on London?s Ash International
     label, showcasing their superb analogue sound experiments.

     From 1998-2005, he was part of the avant punk rock trio Kid
     Commando, a band that toured Europe several times. Also in 1998,
     he founded the iDEAL Organization as a platform for his ongoing
     work as an artist, label owner and curator of the near-legendary
     iDEAL Festival for the last four years.

     Nordwall has collaborated with many artists, including Henrik
     Rylander, Lasse Marhaug and Leif Elggren. He lives and works in
     Gothenburg, Sweden and is a founding member of experimental rock
     band The Skull Defekts (also with Henrik Rylander) who have two
     releases on AA: \"Open the Gates of Miner\" (AA04) and \"Rotating
     Feedback & Save the Skull\" (AA05/IDEAL036), two limited edition
     releases with deluxe card sleeves. The Skull Defekts are also
     releasing a long-awaited full-length studio album in 2006.

     REVIEWS & MEDIA
     Joachim Nordwall was born in 1975 and started playing music in
     1987 as the Alvers Orkester, so then he was thirteen... His
     releases were on the Swedish B├╢rft label (and in 2006 they even
     had a great album on Ash International, see Vital Weekly 512).
     From 1998 to 2005 he was a member of Kid Commando, \'an avant punk
     rock trio\' and also in 1998 he started the iDEAL organisation,
     responsible for some fine releases and a festival. As The Idealist
     he plays solo music, and so strangely enough \'I Am The Fire\' is
     his debut CD. I imagine that if you play this ultra soft, it would
     be indeed ambient music, but the atmospherics captured by Nordwall
     are all together of a much different kind. It\'s as beautiful as it
     also painful, at the same time. Powerful drone music that won\'t
     lull the listener into a deep sleep, but make the hairs on your
     back rise up. Intense music that defies genres, belonging partly
     to industrial music and partly drone/ambient, but is just right
     on.
