Professional Review of "Jay Chou Incomparable Concert Live 2004 (2CD + MV VCD) (Taiwan Version)"

- This professional review refers to Jay Chou 'Incomparable' Concert Live 2004 + Qi Li Xiang a.k.a. Common Jasmine Orange (Hong Kong Limited Edition).

Up to standard: Jay Chou 'Incomparable' Concert Live 2004 (CD) ~ Jay Chou

Warner got the right to publish the latest Chou concert CD, Jay Chou 'Incomparable' Concert Live 2004, after a series of dispute. The album sees twenty five songs from the concert in Taiwan and ten music videos from Qi Li Xiang included.

The present reviewer attended Chou's final concert in Hong Kong and also spent a night to listen to this latest album. He thinks Chou, in the concert, kept his standard and performed well in the concert. While he did touch fans' hearts when singing ballads, he also managed brilliantly when he sang those upbeat songs and the arrangement of dancing was also refreshing.

The majority of the songs in the brand new album are neat. For example, the unplugged medley of Clear Star, Back To The Past and Final War (CD1, Track#11). Fans from Hong Kong might somehow be disappointed as the CD, which only focuses on concerts in Taiwan, does not include Chou's exciting Cantonese versions of Repay, Only You Are Irreplaceable and Offering the World. The plain music version of Li Xiang Lan by flute is not there too.

Those who do not understand every word in the songs unavoidably have difficulties when listening to Chou's raps. But as the more popular ballads come on, this should not prevent the fans from enjoying. After all, that is just a minor problem.

Track (CD2, Track#12), Qi Li Xiang (CD2, Track#8), Park Tour Assembly (CD1, Track#7), Twister (CD1, Track#8), Simple Love (CD2, Track#7), Aground (CD2, Track#1) and In Father's Name (CD1, Track#1) are the songs that the present reviewer would first recommend.

The ten MVs are fabulous especially My Territory (MV, Track#1) featuring Big and Little Jay, Qi Li Xiang (MV, Track#2), Grandma (MV, Track#4) starring Chou's grandma and Cease Fire - Young Victims (MV, Track#10).
