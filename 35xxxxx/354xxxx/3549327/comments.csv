Hey guys! Did you ever hear about the concept of 'file sharing'? If you don't allow any upload, it will take for ever to get this package out.

I planned to publish season 2 and 3 after this torrent was properly distributed, but I don't know if I care to make that happen if you are not willing to assist me."
