,patrioticparadox,2008-10-15T12:31Z,"Control the OVER ALL look of your Windows computer with Theme Manager.  It's a new program that lets you manage all your skins, themes, wallpapers, icons, etc. from a single interface. You can even mix and match them together to create full blown suites! 

Theme Manager is a program that changes the look and feel of the entire Windows environment.  It works by talking to existing desktop enhancement programs and then applying a .suite file.  In short, Theme Manager is a front-end to other desktop enhancement programs to simplify the user experience. 

Theme Manager supports:
Wallpapers 
Visual Styles (WindowBlinds & MSStyles*) 
MP3 Players (Winamp, Windows Media Player, Cool Player) 
Desktop Themes (Microsoft .theme, DesktopX, Hoverdesk, NextStart, ObjectBar) 
Mouse cursors (both Windows and CursorXP) 
Logon Screens (LogonXP format) 
Boot Screens (BootSkin format) 
Icons (both MS Themes and IconPackager themes) 
Widgets (SysMetrix, DesktopX Widgets) 
Instant Messenging Skinning (Trillian, ICQ Plus) 
Launchers (ObjectDock, WorkShelf) 
and more
