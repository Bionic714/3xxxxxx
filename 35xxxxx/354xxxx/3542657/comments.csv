,Phil 8709,2007-02-07T12:23Z,hey which file is the installer or what??
,Romerro,2007-10-02T06:01Z,This is just the add-ons for Ulead Photoimpact 12 and does not appear to contain the exe file to install  Ulead Photoimpact 12.  So basically they are all install files for add-on components.
,ShyllonIT,2008-04-24T14:36Z,"I download Photo impact 12 and all the addons only to find that you cannot install the add-ons in the trial version of photo impact 12.. so i need these patched ones ---
Please can someone seed :)
