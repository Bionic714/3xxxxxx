,seven0fnine,2008-07-02T15:38Z,"I have so fond memories of this movie. I hope it has aged well.

Seeing as you have the DVD is your posession, might I request that you upload the DVD onto piratebay as well? I'm sure that would please many of us 80s afficionados.

In the meanwhile, thank you for this upload."

Came across this as I saw the trailer of his recent ""The Informers"" and it said ""From the author of Ameican Psycho and Less than Zero"". Of course, having read and seen American Psycho, I had to see what this one was all about, so thanks to contributing to my morning pleasure of ""I've got something great to watch!"" :)"
