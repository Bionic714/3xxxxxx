,aux_limites,2008-09-02T06:51Z,Please keep on seeding! This is for sure one of Allens best movies - and itÂ´s not available on DVD where I live anymore.

The smaller version of this film is corrupt (check the comments) so I'm grabbing this one.  I might see if I can convert it to DivX and re-seed.  Doumo."
,LezDawson,2008-09-29T03:06Z,"Here's a clean DivX rip, 699 MB.  It's very good.

,santaccc,2009-01-20T15:54Z,Picture gets a little shaky near the end.  Looks better on WMP classic than on WMP11.
