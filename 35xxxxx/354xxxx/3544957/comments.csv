....do you ever get the feeling that your talking to yourself?   :)"
,georgebah,2006-10-26T03:48Z,Guys this is completely NOT FREE phone calls as you may think you can setup the program and register an account but you cannot make calls until you pay
,www.tpad.com,2006-10-26T14:42Z,"Mr George, you are slightly wrong - if you want to make a call PC to another PC then it is Free - anywhere in the World - (VoIP / IP Call)

You get a Free Tpad Telephone Number and if your friend  has a Tpad Telephone Number then if you dial that 7 digit number then its Unlimited and Free..

If you want to ring Landlines / Mobiles then you go have to buy Pay As You Go Credit - but are call rates are the cheapest on the VoIP Market...

Check the rates at http://www.tpad.co.uk/callrates.php"
