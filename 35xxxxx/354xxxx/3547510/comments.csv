,Sunduc,2007-07-09T21:19Z,"I downloaded both versions available here; the other one is

http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3386958/MED_GRIMM_OG_GRU

I downloaded that other one for comparison, and ake no mistake: The version you are looking at now (the one at 1.37GB) is by far the superior one! The minus for both versions, though, is that they are captured from NRK and don't show the full width of the movie; you will notice this with the initial credits being clipped.

I look forward to when the English-langage version is released on DVD. Then I'll go pay for it rather than download. Take it as a hint, if you're a certain TV company ..."

,lvz,2008-01-04T21:22Z,Tusen takk!
,shawnee317,2008-05-03T06:37Z,"Just decided to become the 3rd seeder.  And will stay for a while. Since this is the highest quality available.

Med Grim og Gru, MaMA, Rockn Roll Wolf, is the best classic show out there. 

If you like this, then make an effort and become the 4 seeder. and maybe the 5th. 

Rare movies and shows need support. We have enough people share the new movies.
