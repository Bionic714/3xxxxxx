have wanted this for long."
,lgeistlinger,2009-01-28T18:31Z,"Ho! come on, This has been up since 2006 and no one has said ""Its not a full book""
Extracted you get 3 disks and total 3hr 34min play time 
The abridged version is 5hr 46min, I would call this one VERY abridged
Listen to the last mp3 it's not the end.. no credits.
Bottom line its missing 2 cds"
