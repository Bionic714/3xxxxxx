,killux12,2006-10-27T21:19Z,"Do you even know what Linux is?

Its an OS just like Microsoft Windows.

PS2 Linux is sort of like BB Navi but is more useful in my case.

With Linux on your PS2 you will basically turn your PS2 into a computer. You will be able to browse the internet, chat with friends or even type up an essay. You can also design PS2 games."
,T0MMIK,2006-10-28T16:21Z,ok thanks.  but do this work if i have chipped my ps2. will tha chip be broken
,lap87,2006-10-28T16:31Z,retard... do you know anything? at all? HOW the HELL would the chip break from using your PS2 the way it's designed for? do a little thinking before you post.... you made my brain hurt
,viperbo21,2006-10-31T03:52Z,Thanks man I spent a long time looking for this.

[T],deathmule,2006-11-03T23:29Z,i tryed this with swap magic and it wont boot. what im i doing wrong here? do u need HD for this to work? does this work with swapmagic? i dont have a modchip installed. has anyonr got this working with swapmagic
,chigga102,2006-11-05T14:51Z,you need ps2 linux dvd1 and dvd2 and you MUST have a no swap modchip

i love it when nerds get upset when people ask simple questions. you better not be yelling at your computer, or you mom will kick you out of her basement ;)"
,bozrom,2006-11-12T10:42Z,The exploitstation site is still running its here http://www.exploitstation.com/index.php?page=articles
,AndreBick,2006-12-30T17:23Z,"ricewithsoysauce, have you ever heard of a LiveCD? LOL OWNED"
,Squibble,2007-01-14T15:48Z,This DVD also contains the official hardware documentation PDFs.
,brianmay27,2007-01-29T11:26Z,"Ok. First DO NOT CALL ME STUPID ETC. I know this may be a ""omg i was that stupid"" but i will beet myself up if that does happen :P. I have a non slim ps2 w/ swap magic but no mod chip. I have tryed everything to get this to work but without sucess. Can some one please tell me if and or how to do it with swap magic that would be helpfull. I will be willing to do anything (except buy anything expencive) to get this to work. Thanks"
,pilly28,2007-02-06T03:18Z,"ricewithsoysauce: technically you can run an os without a drive, linux has had live cd's and dvd's available since oh.... about early 2003 so the question you responded to so politely was imho a legit question in this case , no, you need a hard drive to install to. I've heard talk of someone looking to add black rhino to a dvd for a live os/filesystem. hopefully its not just all talk, as I have a slim ps2 and hdd is (not no option but,) less of an option. anyways I guess this guy is just a windows user.... its not his fault..."
,tonyppe,2007-07-30T20:15Z,"all you people should go to google and search ps2 exploit. you can turn your ps2 into a file browser/ manager, sega and nintento emulator, and a .avi & .mp3 viewer WITHOUT TAKING IT APART :D"
,out there,2007-09-10T21:32Z,"deathmule, you are the moron in this scenario. i have used many computers that lack a hard-drive, it's quite common.  in fact, if YOU knew much about linux, you would understand that there are many distributions designed to be run from a cd with no installation.
get your facts straight before you make a fool of yourself."
,6ixtynin9,2007-11-07T05:49Z,"Has anyone successfully burn this image and get it to boot? I've tried burning with Nero, DVD Decrypter, and MagicISO and none of it works. I think this file is fake. If anyone got it to work please tell me the proper settings and burning software used. Thanks."
,qazwsxijn,2008-01-03T20:30Z,"Here's the deal. You've probably burned it right several times. The problem is, the default display output of the disc is VGA, which your TV can't see (it will just show a black screen when you boot it). They assume you have the PS2 to PC cable and it's hooked up to your monitor.

To see it properly, boot swap magic at normal. When the screen comes up to change discs, put in Linux disc 1 and (heres the trick) HOLD R1 + Select, and while holding those hit X to boot the game. Tada."

u really dont need a hard drive to ""run"" a computer...it will run as soon as u turn it on...with or without the hard drive...u just need the hard drive to actually use the conputer... shhhhhh...

i know its a technicality"
,Shamanskunk,2009-01-14T08:09Z,Everywhere I read if you have a Slimline model SCPH-70000 or newer it won't work! Because there's no way to configure and install it with out a hard drive!!! And no where did it mention that Usb hard drives work!
,powerslavus,2010-05-18T13:22Z,"guys this is probably going to sound like a noob question, this had been prob already established but i've been experimenting with the capacity of my ps2, it's a slim model and I've already installed a couple of things on a memory stick (8gb) is is possible to install and run the linux on a memory stick if i get the soft and stuff? I've tried a couple of things and they've worked,even running games off the memory stick by using ulauncher, and launching the elf file.i'm sorry if this question has been asked before i was just wondering if i should download the linux isos or not.thanks in advance "
,YJH1995,2012-02-08T23:13Z,Download is like 1kb/s When i am done downloading i will try to seed at 500kb/s
