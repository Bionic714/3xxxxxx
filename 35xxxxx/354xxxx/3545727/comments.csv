Covers are incl btw  :)"
,Greven89,2006-11-13T20:50Z,why is it so many files ?
,caiPHP,2006-12-18T02:04Z,"This torrent has a multipart rar inside--why?
It also has idiotic filenames, which follow *no* standard.

Highly unrecommended.  Best to use a different torrent, even if there are fewer seeds."
,Nautix,2006-12-18T22:00Z,"caiPHP  - why bother download at the first time if you hate this torrent so much.. 

I love multipart rar's so deal with them.

And the nice thing about filenames, is that you can change them to match your preferences.."
