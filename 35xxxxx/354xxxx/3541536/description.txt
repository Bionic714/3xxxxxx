Sinopsis: Between its companions is the Flagship of the ship of the Planet Express, Leela (Katey Sagal), beautiful a foreign one with a single eye and able to strike good blows (in spite of its problems of vision to calculate distances); and Bender (John DiMaggio), a robot with very human vices, like the alcohol, the tobacco, the small robberies and a weakness by the robotic pornography (that consists mainly of diagrams of circuits). On board also he is Professor Farnsworth (Billy West), a chiflado scientist whose ideas oscillate between the brilliant thing and madness; Hermes Conrad (Phil LaMarr), a bureaucrat with official license whose coldness towards the crew is clarified by its preoccupation by its lives, but because it does not wish to fill up a pile of forms of Death-during-gives solely if they do not return of a mission, and Amy Wong (Laure Tom), the scholarship holder of the crew, who among other things dedicates itself to be mona and to bind with Lieutenant Kif Kroker (Maurice LaMarche).
