We need an ISO! :)"
,wezywezo,2006-10-18T21:06Z,this is the version 1.8
,wezywezo,2006-10-18T21:07Z,err 1.08
,acantoni,2006-10-19T09:09Z,"I can confirm it's 1.08 and that works

Thanks uploader!!

May i ask how to update it when new patches come out?
Just put the directory in steamapps and run latest steamemu will do ? [3.64 no longer working for me]

Any suggestion would be appreciated.. in any case thanks!!"
,Senso,2006-10-19T18:10Z,Oh well if it's 1.08 then thanks!
,Kalagaraz,2006-10-22T08:01Z,Is this going to get my steam account banned?
,snogard,2006-10-25T02:00Z,"Like the seeder says, unrar and play. You do not need Steam started to play this. I don't know if you need Steam installed or not, but I doubt you would.

This is indeed version 1.08 and it works perfectly without any hassle here."
,Youno,2007-05-22T03:47Z,Seed dammit :)
,Lyyki,2011-03-03T02:06Z,It says that MSVCP71.dll file is not there. What to do?
,asnodeus,2011-03-11T02:02Z,"I found the solution, at least it worked with 1.20 version. What you need to do is:
-download 1.79 patch
-download ""Universal Extractor""
-extract the patch to some random folder
-copy all the files from {app} folder in the extract dir
-paste all the files to the main SE:V folder
-have fun :)"

,tnvidigal,2011-07-25T15:58Z,"I found the 1.79 patch, but it's simply a .exe to make the update, and if i try to run it, I get a message saying that the update  needs an older version of SE5 to be able to make the patch. Is there anywhere I can find the files to update manually? "
,goopd,2011-07-29T02:04Z,"@NephilimNexus
thanks a lot for posting the key got 1.79 working no problem

@tnvidigal

u need the ""Universal Extractor"" program mentioned by asnodeus; just search for it in google or go to 
http://legroom.net/software/uniextract
which is the site you find on google anyway.

-download universal extractor and install

-then when u open Universal Extractor in the top box do browse and find the 1.79 patch exe where ever it is on ur pc 

-after that make a new folder on ur desktop 

-now in the bottom box browse and find the folder u made and then hit extract (the extract to any folder part mentioned by asnodeus)

-once finished open the folder and then open {APP}s folder and copy all the stuff inside to your SE5 directory

-replace all

- use the key NephilimNexus so kindly provided"
