7-c.swf

,BerserkTomte,2008-05-27T19:15Z,This is rather well made and runs smooth. Recommended. 
,pwncakes,2009-03-01T01:05Z,"so yeah, i also got an error while extracting the .rar with the c-1.swf file. it isnt saying that its corrupted, but that the password for it specifically is different... thats probably not the actual case. but yeah, having problems with it, and unfortunately, im not getting any seeds on the c-1 torrent file"
,pwncakes,2009-03-01T01:14Z,"ok....so update:

the, um, WinRar whatever its called software, will unzip all the files with the password provided except the c-1.swf (for me anyway)

i then opened the archive with 7zip and unzipped the the c-1.swf file by itself with the same password (www.anime-miako.to) and it unzipped just fine

hope that helps for my fuckfaced buttmonkey brethren who were having the same problems as me :)"
