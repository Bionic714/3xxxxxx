From Motohiro Katsuyuki, director of Bayside Shakedown and Bayside Shakedown 2, comes the wacky sci-fi comedy, Summer Time Machine Blues! Written by Ueno Makoto (leader of the Europa Kikaku comedy troupe), the film features five members from the troupe as they play a bunch of geeks in a collegiate science fiction club, who just so happen to end up in an out of control time-travel adventure!

It\'s summer break, and the SF Study Circle are playing baseball, while the cutesy Ito (Maki Yoko, from The Grudge) is taking photographs. At the same time, another shutterbug named Shibata (Ueda Juri, from Swing Girls) is developing pictures in a darkroom next to the SF Study Circle\'s base of operations. One member, the shy Komoto (Eita, from Waterboys), has a thing for Shibata, so he buys two tickets to a sci-fi movie in the hopes he can convince her to come along. When he returns to the clubhouse, however, things start to get strange when the air conditioning remote goes on the fritz.

The next day, a stranger (Honda Isao) appears, as does an oddly familiar-looking device. The stranger abruptly vanishes, but the time machine he leaves behind remains! One club member (Nagano Munenori) decides to hop aboard, sets course for the previous day, and begins his journey into the past, a move that will no doubt alter the future and rip the very fabric of the space time continuum. Can the SF Study Circle boys get everything back the way it was? Find out in Summer Time Machine Blues, a freewheeling time travel comedy much in the tradition of Back to the Future trilogy!
