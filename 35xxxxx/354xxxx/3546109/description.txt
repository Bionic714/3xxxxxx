Here is the second part of the Spring and Autumn series of Not The 9 O\'Clock News.  For those of you who didn\'t spot my earlier postings, my apologies, but I\'m still a novice at uploading torrents.

For my two earlier torrents, search for the following titles on Pirate Bay under TV Series:-

\"Four episodes from 1980 - Series 2 and 3 - Part 1\" uploaded 22/10/2006 at 17:38

and:-

\"NotThe9OClockNews1982Part2\" uploaded 17/10/2006 at 20:02

Alternatively, check out www.torrentspy.com where the same torrents have more sensible titles!


Enjoy.
