This was my favourite show in the early 80's, and I can't understand why they haven't released all the episodes on DVD yet. That lame-ass ""best of"" DVD doesn't count (even though I bought it)...

I'm downloading parts I and II now, and I will be seeding for quite some time. This is good stuff - it deserves a wide audience.

All the best,
