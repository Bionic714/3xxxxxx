Awesome band. They've got a sound that's quite unique which is refreshing change from the MTV crap."

,Tetuh,2009-02-03T02:11Z,Why is this .ogg? It doesn't even play in my normal music player. mp3 would have been better. 
,dracheprinz,2009-02-26T01:24Z,please seed 
,PandaaMayaa,2011-08-04T00:43Z,Someone seed please! D:
,PandaaMayaa,2011-08-12T20:45Z,"So I finally got it, but I can't use .ogg. I'm sure I can find a converter, but still. >.>"
,noircakes,2011-09-01T06:30Z,"You can use VLC media player to listen to the files. I'm sure there is a converter somewhere online, but if you can't find one, there is always Audacity which will take a little longer~ But you can convert it to a.... ah, wmv file, which will play on WMP or iTunes. "
