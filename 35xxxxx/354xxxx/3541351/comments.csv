,valoi,2006-10-19T16:26Z,"What do I do after I have downloaded and unpacked rzr-fm07.bin file ?

I could use some help"
,raisak,2006-10-20T14:13Z,"Usually I dont reply on such obiouse  comments... Buut since you ask so nicely..


Take fm.exe and PLACE it in youre installed game folder.. I.E 

C:\Program files\Football Manager 2007

A little tip, rename youre original fm.exe to fm.exe.bak so when you want to update the game with a patch you can just delete the cracked exe and rename the original bak to fm.exe ... Might save you reinstallation time ;)"

,Terry3k,2006-12-02T16:16Z,How do I get a patch to work with this?
,raisak,2007-02-02T02:06Z,"You dont get the latest patch to work whit this one, you need tisnabro`s Maxi-Image. You can DL it here: http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3577579/Football.Manager.2007_Maxi-Image

That one works like a charm (tested it myself)."
