,thuglife50010309,2007-07-10T21:32Z,how do i download
,smurfiz,2007-08-22T02:50Z,"umm, thug....if u mean a program, u should search on google for ''utorrent'' and then download it, put this torrent in a folder, and then when u got ''Utorrent, u just click on the ''TORRENT'' and you started download, hope u know how to open a .rar file..."
,stormester,2007-12-18T02:19Z,this aint hip hop sampels............ just dull cold synth sounds...sorry but its true(you can use this sounds in pop or some thing).......................................:) peace
,RajinCadian,2008-01-17T23:10Z,This collection is useless..!! Its just a bunch of crappy midi sounds recorded as wave! So you loose the flexibilty of midi genarated sounds and gain the distavange of larve wave files... a few special effects on here might be usefull but its not worht downloading 1 and half gigs... dont waste your time
,soad811,2009-08-27T04:31Z,"i think if OP would take ""hip hop"" out of the description, and instead put ""trance/techno/ambient/etc"" in its place, this torrent would be correctly and more efficiently marketed. 

i am a hip hop producer, and i cannot use any of these samples right now. not to say that it cant be done, i just lack the ingenuity to pull it off. "
,d0mag0j,2010-01-18T00:26Z,"Hmmm.. well this sucks. I mean, download is fast but I don't like samples. "
,herbie_seky,2010-02-04T13:51Z,"Hi, Anybody know where to get dem mo phatt sounds? cheers"
,metalatem,2010-09-02T07:45Z,No drum kits?
,pawnone,2011-09-05T19:55Z,"its just a collection of synthy sounds recorded in wav format good for trance or pop but not hip hop... I guess if you think drake is hip hop here you go great for all of those who think RnB is hip hop, guess what its not.... stop letting Mtv control your brain..."
