Ghost stories
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Gakk√¥ no kaidan\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"

A must see!

ADV essentially took this anime and threw out the script they were given to dub with because it sucked.  Then they gave this show to the dub team and told them to do whatever they wanted with it (although they kept the plot - sort of).  From this comes gems such as \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Why is it principals always look like lesbians?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"

Watch the dub, trust me on this one.
