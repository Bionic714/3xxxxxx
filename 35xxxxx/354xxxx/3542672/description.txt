The Rocky Horror Picture Show is a wonderful creation from the musical stage show by Richard O'Brien! A story of creation, love, hate, adventure, and, most of all, sex, the story begins in Denton, Ohio as Brad Majors (Barry Bostwick) and Janet Weiss (Susan Sarandon), after getting engaged (Dammit Janet), travel to see "the man who began it," but wind up at the castle of Dr. Frank-N-Furter (Tim Curry), a transvestite alien from the planet of Transsexual in the galaxy of Transylvania (Sweet Transvestite). And they meet Riff Raff (Richard O'Brien), Magenta (Patricia Quinn), and Columbia (Nell Campbell) which leads to "doing the Time Warp again!" They discover they have been there on a "special night." Frank's creation is to be born! As Rocky has been revealed (Sword of Damocles / I Can Make You A Man), rebel Eddie (Meat Loaf), Frank's last-recent creation, ponders in on his motorcycle (Hot Patootie-Bless My Soul) whom Frank kills. In comes Dr. Everett Von Scott (Jonathan Adams, RIP), he's come for Eddie (Eddie's Teddy) which results in the discovery of Eddie's deceased body. Frank chases Janet and Brad and Dr. Scott chase Frank (Planet Schmanet Janet), which results in everybody (but Frank) getting frozen. Enter the floor show (Rose Tint My World / Don't Dream It / Wild & Untamed Thing) which then turns into the horrifying death of both Frank and Columbia die and the castle's blasting off! Brad, Janet, and Dr. Scott survive and leave with torn clothes and battered bodies (Superheroes, only in the UK version). This leads to Shock Treatment, the very-unsuccessful sequel with the continuing adventures of Brad and Janet.
