,korpatalik,2008-12-10T08:32Z,thanx for this film.
,pofkezas,2009-01-15T20:07Z,"If you're trying to play this back on Linux (and possibly OS X), you might run into some trouble with the audio. I couldn't get it to play correctly on either VLC, xine, or mplayer. To fix it, simply use avidemux2 to recompress the audio into mp3 or vorbis."
