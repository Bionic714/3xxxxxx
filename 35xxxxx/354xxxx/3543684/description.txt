"Stroszek. First name, Bruno. Five foot six. Eye colour, brown. Oval. No distinguishing features". 
With a bugle cry Bruno is sent into freedom. With the decay of germany and the now dull sound of its culture ringing out, Bruno, his landlord and a prostitute seek the promised fortunes of America.

David Lynch ? ?I think Herzog is one of the all time greats. Really great. I once saw  Stroszek on tv. I?d missed the beginning of it so I thought it was, like, some real documentary. I was just captivated in the first two seconds. Id never seen anything like it.?

Herzog?s brilliant film slowly drills deep into the American dream and lets the madness that it discovers gush out, filling the screen, in one of the most chaotic and memorable last ten minutes of any film ever made.
