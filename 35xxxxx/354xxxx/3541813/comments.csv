,teirdes,2006-10-23T16:07Z,"P00f! Is there any way to know what you're actually getting when you're downloading this? I'm slightly suspicious about the frequent occurence of the word ""metal"" in your description, but if you tell me there're some good ASF songs on there, I'm all for. Cheers!"
,AssMaster,2006-10-23T17:49Z,"teirdes: I've used the word ""metal"" two times in the description fyi ;) and sure, metal is the word to describe most tunes in this pack. I hope you didn't get disappointed :)"
