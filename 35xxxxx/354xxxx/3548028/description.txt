Capo\'s highly-anticipated new album, Hustler\'s P.O.M.E (Product Of My Environment) is set for release on Tuesday, November 7th.

Featuring the anthem \"We Fly High\" (Baaaaaalllllliiiiiinnn!!), \"Reppin\' Time\" and \"Pin The Tail\" feat. Cam\'ron & Juelz Santana, this is Jim
Jones\' best album to date. As Jimmy explains it \"when you are coming up on the streets you got to hustle to survive or else you\'ll be left out in
this cold world.  That\'s all we got and that\'s what my music depicts.  It depicts stories of everybody comin\' up. Sometime it\'s hopeless, but you
got to stay focused. We on the street corners doing the daily, and that\'s what we call hustlin\'. Stay tuned for some powerful music.  Your boy,
Jones.\"

The Diplomats have become the household definition of hustling, and Jimmy brings his hustle to life with Hustler\'s P.O.M.E.  The streets-
proclaimed \"Dipset Capo\" takes the Diplomat movement to new levels with his charismatic swagger, gritty lyrical realism, and head-nodding
production.  With guest appearances from The Diplomats, Lil\' Wayne, Baby and many more, Hustler\'s P.O.M.E. is sure to bang in every hood and
every block.  Baaaallllllllliiinnnnn!!!
