,Aristokrat,2006-10-16T22:48Z,"Thats strange, cause everybody has 0,0% of the file and there is no seeder in sight, so I cant understand how u can be seeding. Maybe u are doing something wrong?"

Thanks for the Tiger Woods Torrent but are you aware that you are not seeding it.  I just wondered if you may be making an error and arent' aware of the error.  Send me a note or ask on Pirate Bay torrent comments if you have any questions.

You have to leave the torrent program running and not move the file for it to be able to seed and you must wait until at least one person has received the whole program before they can take over seeding it so it will probably take a day or three or four for the initial seed.  You can stop and start in that period though."

,Aristokrat,2006-10-19T11:34Z,"He uploaded 6 torrents the same day and havent been seeding on any of them. Ether he dont know how or he is just fucking with us. I suppose he just dont know how to do it. 

Think we can forget about this torrent and wait for someone else to upload this game."
