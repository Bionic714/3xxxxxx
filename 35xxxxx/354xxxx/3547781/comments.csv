,zsoti,2007-01-19T12:05Z,"köszi
thank you man! "
,Zelest_c,2007-01-20T22:41Z,"This would have been the ultimate wet dream, was it just not for one thing... most of the c&c songs are in mono, just the right speaker. For instance ""No Mercy"" goes like:
""No No No! ... ... ... .. No! No! No! ... ... ...""
when I know it should really be:
""No No No! No Mercy! No! No! No! Mercy is for the weak.""

Otherwise, friggin' awesome release =)"
,Threedots_dead,2007-01-25T21:40Z,"Thanks for all the kind words. I´m still uploading, but recently I´ve only been getting crap speeds. I´m hoping you guys help me by seeding a lot, thanks.

Zelest_c: Hmm... Sorry about that, but they were like that when I got them. I haven´t been converting them or anything, so if anyone screwed up, it wasnt me! :)"

,Gurkpappa,2008-03-03T14:03Z,YEEEAAAA. EVE-Online Music. Thank you Threedots_dead 
,Waltorhomington,2008-03-07T04:23Z,This music is fun. Thanks.
,Waltorhomington,2008-04-07T01:42Z,"I've downloaded the others now. Oh, they are soo good!

Will there be a number 4 tho?"
,DEC_42,2008-04-09T01:16Z,"Superb job, Threedots. It's just, Some of the music I downloaded is only coming out in one speaker... Perhaps it's a problem on my end, but would you take a look at your file integrity? 

Oh, and is it possible for you to upload the rest of the BF2 and more of the EVE soundtracks? I've been scourging the internet for the two but to no avail."
,Lukion,2008-07-31T02:32Z,you are a god
,szederp,2008-08-05T12:27Z,Threedots..... you are a wonderful person!
,Wormicle,2008-08-15T20:16Z,Very well done. The Frank Klepacki collection is particularily appreciated.
,capt.night,2008-10-25T04:45Z,I love you :)
,Captain_Seasick,2009-05-19T10:32Z,"Wtf?! The Dungeon Siege collection is HORRIBLY incomplete! How can you even think to ""publish"" something like this when it doesn't even feature all the soundtracks?

Weak, man. Really weak."
,Villodre,2009-06-03T22:45Z,"Wow, how fucking lame from your part. If it's so incomplete get your ass to upload it yourself and stop whining.

Back to the matter, thanks a lot Threedots, this is an awful lot of game music. Thumbs up, man!"
,brohken,2009-08-17T18:20Z,"Thank you! Ignore those with the ""entitled"" attitude."
