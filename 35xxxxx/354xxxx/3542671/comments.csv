,jeppeone,2008-12-23T18:56Z,"The description is kind of thin, don't you think?
I've downloaded it and confirmed that it is this product: http://www.gaiam.com/product/media-library/yoga-dvds/yoga-for-beginners/kundalini+yoga+dvd.do
A very good instruction video indeed, feels very genuine."
,ChmoVSkafandre,2008-12-24T21:48Z,The only thing thats good about this video is the the quality... the workout itself is complete crap and a waste of time.....
,Blacklordheaven,2009-03-10T19:29Z,ChmoVSkafandre: that's because it's not a 'workout'
,vikhr,2009-05-25T09:41Z,"@ChmoVSkafandre
This is definitely not a workout..and should be taken very seriously..
Kundalini yoga is a pure spiritural science that leads to enlightenment and God-Realization under the guidance of a Spiritual Master. The awakening of kundalini means awakening of inner knowledge.-en.wikipedia.org
p.s. Engaging in advance yoga practice without expert oversight could lead to serious consequences.."
,m00nluvr,2009-06-03T05:04Z,"I agree, this is not a workout.  It's not supposed to be.  Straight from Gaiam's website on basic yoga styles:
Who it's best for: Practitioners embrace Kundalini as a holistic form of yoga that applies to all aspects of life and does not focus exclusively on fitness.

If you want yoga for a workout, try vinyasa/ashtanga, or bikram.  Those require a great deal more fitness."
,disco99,2010-02-03T18:28Z,"Thank you, this is a good introduction to Kundalini :)"
,j00k,2010-05-11T21:49Z,"I couldn't get this to work...
Anyway, the same dvd is here in a compressed form:

,teletubie9999,2011-12-29T03:17Z,"Sory guys, dont wasted your time downloading this video, this is not the true kundalini yoga

If you are an real seeker, search for the book kundalini yoga by Sivananda"
