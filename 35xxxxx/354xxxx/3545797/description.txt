Plot Outline 
The story of the punk rock band The Ramones. 

Plot Synopsis: 
In 1974, the New York City music scene was shocked 
into consciousness by the violently new and raw sound 
of a band of misfits from Queens, called The Ramones. 
Playing in a seedy Bowery bar to a small group of fellow 
struggling musicians, the band struck a chord of disharmony 
that rocked the foundation of the mid-'70s music scene. 
This quartet of unlikely rock stars traveled across the 
country and around the world connecting with the 
disenfranchised everywhere, while sparking a movement 
that would resonate with two generations of outcasts 
across the globe. Although the band never reached the 
top of the Billboard charts, it managed to endure 
by maintaining a rigorous touring schedule for 22 years.
