,mrfashozz,2009-10-30T18:22Z,hey can you guys teach me how to play the game without the disc. it always says insert disk
,Stalker_Stalker,2009-12-24T07:19Z,Failed to even download the torrent with utorrent
,DiZturb3d,2010-01-15T06:57Z,"Fattar inte hur folk kan ha svårt att få det att funka, kanske borde kolla upp hur man använder iso filer innan ni tankar hem? :)

Anyway, funkar kanon.. men klarade spelet igår och blev snopen över att spelet börjar om på normal när man kör new game? Ska man inte kunna köra Nightmare och Hell också på original 1:an, blev grymt besviken ;/"
,segin,2010-03-29T11:18Z,"hey retards that keep asking for a NoCD: Quit asking, this game doesn't install all the game data to the hard drive, in fact it only install about 6MB of .exe/.dll and nothing else! 

So, if you want a NoCD, then mount the ISO in a virtual CD drive.

If you want something other than that... wish in one hand and shit in the other, see which one fills up faster..."
,JShuSkates,2010-10-15T02:41Z,SEED!!!!!!!! this is awesome thanks a ton
,thebabyeater,2011-01-02T01:33Z,This is a bad torrent...i did everything right and it keeps not responding when i start it up
,limedisciple,2011-05-02T08:17Z,"Thanks alot.
Seeding."
,ArtK,2011-06-10T23:12Z,"This patch isn't working for me. It says can't find a file which is named ""C:/Program Files/Documents and Set. This is all it says. Help?"
,krakken86,2011-09-24T02:15Z,"alright, after careful study and long hours creating algorithms...i've come to the conclusion that you people are quite stupid, well here you are:
 1. have utorrent
 2. click download this torrent
 3. wait
 4. make sure you have ISOburner
 5. right click on the gold disk
 6. mount it
 7. go to computer and click diablo.
 8. install
 9. PLAY.

this is pretty darn right idiot proof, 9 steps for a 2 second download. please have a nice day."
,freedombaz,2011-10-22T21:37Z,Anyone can seed ^^ ???
,MrAwesomeLuis,2012-05-19T06:00Z,for the ones who are saying they need disk. you need to have an iso opener or mounter such as daemon tools mounting it and on since it doesn't really install but open up to your pc
,MrAwesomeLuis,2012-05-22T22:15Z,i cannot find my svaes through i have one. where can i look for them? i do not see a save folder i the game and i searched in appdata no luck
,hoogli,2012-05-26T21:10Z,"There is something wrong with the magnet file even though I'm using the latest utorrent. It works if I remove the torrent from utorrent, download the .torrent file instead, and use that."
,sagiy19,2012-06-12T22:59Z,"@MrAwesomeLuis, there was no ""appdata"" or anything like that back in win95.
The game just saves into a file called ""single_0.sv"".
It's that simple.

@Uploader, AKA maxaki, I can't seem to manage to play the intro movie.. I'm afraid that the rest of the movies won't play either when I'll get to them.
Can anyone confirm that they do play?
And what about the intro movie?"
,private42,2012-08-23T03:53Z,"Works perfectly, just needed to emulate the iso with alcohol 120%. thanks!"
,GnmDvd,2012-08-27T22:50Z,THANKS
