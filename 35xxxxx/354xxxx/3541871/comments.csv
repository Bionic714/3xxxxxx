Thanks for sharing none the less !!"
,mister_playboy,2008-11-10T07:45Z,Excellent.  Thank you.
,phound,2008-11-10T17:05Z,"@frankBIG 

Track 1 was somehow combined with track 2 during the ripping process.  In any case, the complete CD audio is on this torrent.  Nothing is missing.  Cheers."
,piecilati,2011-01-29T16:23Z,"I guess track No. 1 is still missing, as they start singing already in the first minute of the track No. 2, just a little bit of bells there."
,T0B1N,2011-11-03T21:44Z,"Thanks for this, My poor CD is scratched to hell and gone. Track 1 and 2 are in 2. Track 1 is only bells and about 15-20 seconds long, track 2 is 3.48 mins, so that's why 2 is longer in this download, they're together."
