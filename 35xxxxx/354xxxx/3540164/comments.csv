,CatScratchFever,2008-01-01T05:29Z,"I lived in the US during the era years ago when Tony Robbins' infomercials were on air 24 hours a day.  Like many people, I got the impression that he was shuckster, full of hype, with limited value..... Having downloaded and listened to Get the Edge, I have drastically changed my view of Tony Robbins.  This is really good stuff.  He admits many times in this material that he isn't so smart; he has just collected good ideas from highly successful people. And he states that he isn't a guru, rather, a coach. He comes across as very self-deprecating, even stopping himself sometimes when he realizes he's getting too hyper and talking too fast.  THis download is highly recommended.  Hearty thanks to the uploader and seeders for this potentially life-changing package. "

,FaustusTheAwesome,2009-01-06T22:49Z,"ehh...okay i can reccommend this.

I'm not usually big on this sort of thing but Tony Robbins knows his stuff.

Reccommended by some stranger on the internet!"
