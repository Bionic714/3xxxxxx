,metsapeikko,2006-11-09T09:16Z,"Mmm, thanks, im dloading it now."
,J-Ripperz,2006-11-28T00:01Z,Awsome man! :) To bad the Warcraft orc and Human sounds wasn't in this.
,aotredem,2006-12-15T00:02Z,could we get another seed or two?  I'm showing 0 seeds in my client and I'm not even 25% done.
,Queszacoatl,2007-01-19T11:42Z,the torrent is broken...
,Threedots_dead,2007-01-25T21:34Z,"aotredem: There are seeds. Just wait for the program to connect properly. 

Queszacoatl:
Wtf does that mean? It´s not broken. It´s working just fine."
,Queszacoatl,2007-01-31T20:16Z,I can't get it to work... Just says broken torrent... Is it possible to upload the torrent again?
,Queszacoatl,2007-01-31T20:33Z,"And btw I didn't mean to sound like an assh*le, I apologize!"
,Threedots_dead,2007-02-01T03:40Z,"Hmm... That´s weird. Other people that have written to me seem to have recieved it without problems.
Maybe you could try it from another source?
Like this one:
http://www.btmon.com/Audio/Music/Game_Music_Gems_Vol._2.torrent.html"
,Queszacoatl,2007-02-01T11:02Z,"Nope, that one did'nt work either... Could the problem be my torrentreader? Or the fact that I use mac?"
,P4p3Rc1iP,2007-02-04T15:28Z,"Thanks for this, adds more to my collection! I already had about half of this, but more is always better! :)"
,Threedots_dead,2007-02-06T14:19Z,"Queszacoatl: Sorry man, I haven´t got a clue what could be wrong. I´m not very experienced with these things...  Try out volume 1 and see if you get the same error.

P4p3Rc1iP: My pleasure."
,Queszacoatl,2007-02-14T22:10Z,"Vol. 1 works perfect, so I guess I'll just have to settle with that one for now... Thanks anyway!"
,seahan,2007-02-14T23:39Z,Great torrent.  Thanks for this.
,chrisse002,2007-02-15T18:33Z,Is this the new remastered music for morrowind or the original that comes with the game???
,Threedots_dead,2007-02-20T20:10Z,"Don´t mention it guys.
Volume 3 is up. Get it here:
http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3622895/Game_Music_Gems_Vol._3
chrisse002:Not sure, i thinks it´s ripped from the game files. Real orchestra though. Unfortunately I only managed to find two songs. The main theme and a battle tune."
,Phil_89,2007-02-22T20:12Z,"Thank you, Thank you, Thank you!!!
I just needed to have the Halo 2 Soundtrack, it's really good. And the fact that Incubus made 4 of the  songs(well 1 divided into 4 quarters) makes it even better. So THANK YOU!"
,Kheynom,2007-03-04T23:29Z,"Hmm, it's weird... Tracker shows 7seeders, but I started this torrent few hours ago and all I got asi 30people stuck on 0.9%... Anyone experiencing the same?"
,Threedots_dead,2007-03-05T20:53Z,"That IS weird. I see plenty of seeds and people with 
different amounts downloaded.
Leave it on for a while longer and see what happens. "
,Kheynom,2007-03-05T21:13Z,"It's just 24hours later and everyone moved to from 0.9% to 1%. I've even tried different clients... OK thanks, I'll wait then. :)"
,Kheynom,2007-03-05T23:33Z,"Problem solved. It seems that I've got a corrupted torrent file. It works fine only with proper torrent file downloaded from PirateBay. Isohunt and other index sites have the wrong torrent.

Anyway, thanks for help, I'm really looking forward to hear this. Truly gems. Big up! :)"
,Threedots_dead,2007-03-09T15:09Z,Kheynom: Hmm... I´ll have to look into that. You´re saying everyone except PB has the wrong torrent-file? How the hell could that have happened?
,smrarcher,2007-04-02T23:29Z,Seed Please
,Threedots_dead,2007-04-13T17:40Z,Will do.
,Minthos,2007-04-16T17:03Z,"Can't download this torrent with BitTornado on linux, because one of the filenames contain the ~ character, which is a special character in linux.

These errors occurred during execution:
[16:42:37] got bad file info - path ~kr-from-below-v2.mp3 disallowed for security reasons"
,The_playboy,2007-06-27T18:04Z,seed please!
,Threedots_dead,2007-06-29T16:31Z,muldjord: Glad to hear you´re putting game music out there. Getting clients to connect and show up properly can be a real pain in the ass sometimes. First just make sure that you upload the entire torrent to a few people that can help you seed. My email is lawe_jedi@hotmail.com if you should need any help.
,Rudicoolous,2007-09-03T06:40Z,Can't U include or make a torrent of the Scarface game's soundtrack.Its got really cool 80's tracks
,gomzi,2007-11-18T16:30Z,"WOW awesome, just searched for game music, coz i like them a lot, instrumental game music, yes i do hear IGI music and kinda music, the more the better, 

i'm gonna stop all my downloads and get this precious pack of game music first.

,gomzi,2007-11-19T02:09Z,"but i cant seed unless i have them, right! So someone please sed"
,yngvarystein,2008-01-15T06:25Z,"Hi
Somebody please seed so I can complete this d/l and seed away. Once or if I have completed download I shall seed it for 2 weeks such that other people can complete their downloads. And then it's their turn to seed.
Thank you for this nice upload Threedots"
,NaZGuLxNL,2008-01-17T23:13Z,hmm been stuck on 99.9 % for a few days now :|
,greatgazoo19,2008-02-05T01:20Z,Can someone please finish the seed?  I'm stuck at 99.9% like everyone else here.
,szederp,2008-08-05T12:29Z,"Baldur's Gate, Fallout, Planescape ???? You have good taste man! Greetings and thanks from Hungary!"
,szederp,2008-08-05T12:39Z,"Oh, I almost forgot Icewind Dale. Threedots, you sure know great games!"
,DjinnKid2,2008-08-08T05:41Z,"This set of Might and Magic is not any of them either. It appears to be a private artist. (I know I am going out of order.)

Aww, no Sheogorath music. I hope in a later Elder Scrolls game there will be a way to return Jyggalag to his ""Cursed"" form."
,RareRazz,2008-08-16T21:33Z,i have U2 but i never realized that the OST was so good! But the game ....sux....
,OriginalFire,2008-10-17T07:00Z,"Dude!
220Kbps!??

THAT'S A RECORD FOR ME ^______^

Ur Teh Pwnage!"
,evilof,2009-06-08T20:29Z,"This is definitly Warhammer-music. Im not 100% certain... but I dont think its from Shadow of the Horned Rat, so it should be from Warhammer - Dark Omen (both great games btw, altough SotHR has aged alot)."
,brohken,2009-08-17T18:21Z,Thank you!
