,Pman3003,2006-11-01T20:36Z,"Great upload. Works fine, but does someone know where I can get a noDVD-crack for the 1.22a (universal) upgrade? this version is only 1.22 (not universal)"
,mistermaggi,2006-11-05T12:58Z,"I would vote for a UB no-dvd Crack, too! It doesn't really work on MacOS Intel!

,musological,2006-11-14T23:47Z,"Sorry guys, I haven't come across a UB specific crack.  I assume you've tried with the official UB patch - http://www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/games/demos_updates/civilizationiiicomplete.html.

I'm still on a powerMac so wasn't aware of the problem.

Will keep my eyes open.

,donatj,2006-12-05T01:54Z,I updated it and it isn't working.  Oh well
,tommywing,2007-01-04T18:31Z,"I have the same trouble, it works before you update it with the attached crack, but once you patch the game to get round the ""Pedial Icons LARGE"" crash it asks for the Original disc.

I've tried burning a DVD, mounting a disk image using toast and Disk utility but it hasn't worked. 

Is there a solution?

,tommywing,2007-01-07T20:15Z,Surely someone muct have an idea how to fix this???
,biaojutsu,2007-01-08T03:17Z,"Yes! I am waiting for a UB Rev 1.22a no DVD Crack also. 

Looking and looking, but cannot find... 

I will surely past a link here if I find it, please do the same. Our combined efforts will find it someday. I just wish I had the skiil to make it on my own."
,tommywing,2007-01-18T20:16Z,"Come on folks you lot love a challange! write a crack for the updated version of Civ 3! 

Please!"
,Silver_Surfer,2007-02-05T20:43Z,"I downloaded it today, did what it told me to do and it doesn't work!! :-(
I opened the .dmg, it said to drag and drop   ""Civilization 3 Complete No DVD"" in
the ""Civilization 3 Complete"" game folder.
Everytime i click on the ""Civilization 3 Complete No DVD"" icon it tries to start up and then suddenly stops and gives me a crash report!

What do i do about this?
I'm pretty new at this so i really could use some help in this matter!
Thx

,hogscape,2007-02-16T10:07Z,"Folks is this actually 'Civilization 3 Complete' (Civ3, Play The World & Conquests) or is it just Civilization 3?

Many thanks"
,thisme,2007-03-27T20:45Z,"comon' I really need the crack, I can't stand not to play the greatest game I ever started. :("
,Wing Gull,2007-04-30T23:08Z,"Just tried burning DVD, didn't work. The crack works, but I want to play online, so thats going to be a problem... Like other people pointed out, Toast and disk mounting doesn't work, how do you get this to work?"
,grrcubon,2007-07-05T07:57Z,"yes MAC version, but I need it for PC ty
in any event there's a new History of Canada add on ""The New World"" for Civ3 and it's free at http://historycanadagame.com/ for Versions for Civ3 Conquests v1.22 and Civ3 Complete"
,ordo93,2007-11-14T00:07Z,"Hi, same problem here.

I have a Intel-Macbook w/ Leopard. Clicking the crack has no effect whatsoever.

Has anybody tried this on a Intel-Mac w/ Tiger ?

,arnaudnette,2007-11-23T15:51Z,Hi there. Can someone please seed again. There are two of us trying to download. Thank you.
,maeggi,2008-02-13T18:07Z,"Hi!
Hier die erhoffte Hilfe, zumindest f체r MacUser,
Trouble gibts wie so oft bei Spielen mit Quicktime, bzw. addons davon. Bei mir ging so lang nichts, bis ich Perian deaktiviert habe, also versuchts mal damit. Falls es bei Windows etwas 채hnliches gibt, vielleicht mal diesen Weg probieren?
For our english speaking friends:
As usual in game playing, its Quicktime or any addons of it, that causes trouble.
try to deaktivate Perian or any similar addons in windows, in the Sytem controls, then it shoul work. "
,ScottUK,2008-06-18T12:45Z,"Don't think the crack works on Leopard.  It starts up OK and lets you put the serial number in, but when it comes to starting up the game, it asks you to insert the original disc.  Tried it on my old iBook G4 with Panther and the game runs fine.  Does anyone know of a crack for this game for Leopard, or able to give instructions to fix this one?"
,voytekbb,2008-07-08T07:37Z,"Works on Leopard /MacBook Pro 15' - just follow instruction of Etabeeta.

,DerPapst,2008-11-05T07:31Z,"Hi folks!

Might be a stupid question - where can i find the serialcode in the folders? 

Opened every one but still cant find it... =(

Hope it works after that, great work! :)"

,kukodajanos,2009-12-26T19:24Z,Anyone can use it with the crack in multiplayer mode in LAN?
,fat47,2010-01-15T07:30Z,"I tried the directions exactly and then tried it with the patch but it didnt work. When I try to open ""civilization 3 complete no dvd"" it doesnt open. When I try to open ""civilization 3 complete"" it asks for a disk. I never had a screen to enter a SN either. Whats up with this? Im using an intel macbook and running snow leopard. "
