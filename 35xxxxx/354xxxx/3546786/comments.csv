Jesusv06, you're a dumbass. It won't download because nobody is seeding. .zip format is an archive format that compresses the file to make it a smaller size for a quicker download.

Great book, though. It makes you realize that atheism is better than theism. Satanism is gay, almost as gay as all the other religions. (including Wiccan)
