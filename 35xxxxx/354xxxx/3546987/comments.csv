,tango11281,2007-02-25T02:16Z,"GeoTrail, Ogg is a media container format which is mainly used to encapsulate Vorbis files. Vorbis is a lossy audio codec. It uses modified discrete cosine transform (MDCT) just like MP3 does. However, most people experience the audio quality of Vorbis superior to MP3 at the same bitrate. Thus with Vorbis as audio codec you usually get files that are smaller and/or provide better quality than files with MP3 as audio codec.

You probably confused it with FLAC (Free Lossless Audio Codec). Ogg files can also contain audio encoded with FLAC. In case of this torrent, this is highly unlikely as FLAC usually provides a compression ratio of 30-50%. 

Vorbis and FLAC are both codec projects by the Xiph.Org Foundation which dedicated itself to provide public domain (thus free) multimedia formats and tools.
