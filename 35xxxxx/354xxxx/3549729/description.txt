Extended Noise was formed in the fall of 1982 under the name \"AHA !!\" The group was gradually turned into a quintet (guitar player Frode Alnæs, later Bjørn Klakegg was the fifth member), and stayed this way until early 1987. This band was one of the central forces in the close-to-almost-free-improvised-music movement in Norway in the mid-1980s, with elements as far apart as tango and free blowing.
