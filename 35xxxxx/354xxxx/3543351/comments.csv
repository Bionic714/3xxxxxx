,Snowflake85,2007-05-31T13:56Z,"DO NOT Download this.

It does work and the Crack allows you to login in with any username/password but then the game forces an auto-update and gets stuck at verifying game files."
,Snowflake85,2007-05-31T14:00Z,"Or accually disregard that comment.
There's a workaround, start the game with the regular .exe and simply access the Demo.
That will allow you to successfully download the game updates."
,Snowflake85,2007-05-31T14:17Z,"Or back to my 1st statement... (LĂŚl)
There's a small patching process every time you attemp to start the game which means you cant start the cracked version, alas no way to get the full version with this copy."
