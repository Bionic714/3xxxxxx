In a land known as the Dragon Realms, the elder dragons are preparing for a video documentary of sorts about their realm. Meanwhile, the antagonist Gnasty Gnorc, who had been banished from the realms, becomes upset over comments the dragons make of him. Enraged, Gnasty Gnorc bombards the Dragon Realms with a magical spell, freezing the resident dragons into crystalline statues, and sends an army of Gnorcs in to steal the dragons' treasure.

However, Gnasty somehow missed imprisoning the youngest dragon in the realm, Spyro. Realizing who is responsible for the disaster, Spyro sets out to free the realm's dragons, recover their treasure hoard from the invading Gnorcs, and then confront and defeat Gnasty Gnorc himself.
