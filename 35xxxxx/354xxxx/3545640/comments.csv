Thanks!"
,Hyarion_1,2007-01-07T06:54Z,"Whoever made this torrent is an absolute moron. First of, no information about the files whatsoever. When I finished the download I didn't know what to do with the .cue file, as clonecd and alcohol wouldn't recognize it. After a long search I finally got hold of BlindWrite 6 to write the .cue with the .sub data. Even after all that the actual image was corrupt: much of the background music doesn't load or comes through like a scratched record.

Instead of posting shitty copypasta from the games back cover how about posting info like what program was used to make the image, what cd-reader was used, what speed, what settings etc.

I am currently trying another torrent for a working copy of Spyro 1."
,martenslox,2007-08-09T20:09Z,"Sorry, but I didn't make the images, and they worked for me with no problems: Maybe the fault is on your side...
I use ePSXe for emulating PS1, try it."
,martenslox,2007-08-11T18:43Z,"Yeah, you were right, after redownloading I see that the music is really corrupted, I'm sorry.
If anyone here has the original game CD, please make an image of it and upload it instead of mine (since I don't have a working CD - it is really VERY scratched)"

,Hollissterr,2008-11-11T03:27Z,I'm using CDRwin and it's not recognizing my empty DVD-R disk...
