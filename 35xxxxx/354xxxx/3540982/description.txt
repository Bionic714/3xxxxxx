"When acclaimed documentary filmmaker D A Pennebaker (Monterey Pop, The War Room) filmed Bob Dylan during a three week concert tour of England in the Spring of 1965, he had no idea he was about to create one of the most intimate glimpses of the rock legend ever put on film. Wanting to make more than just a concert film, Pennebaker sought both the public and private Bob Dylan. With unobtrusive equipment and rare access to the elusive performer, he achieved a fly-on-the-wall glimpse of one of the most influential musicians of all time.Hailed as one of the best documentaries about a performing artist ever created, DONT LOOK BACK is more than a view into an extraordinary concert tour-Bob Dylan?s last as an acoustic performer. It is a window into the 60s, its spirit, and one of the poet-musicians whose words and songs defined it.\" (from the Docurama presentation)
