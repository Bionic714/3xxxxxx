,overlordy1,2006-10-20T17:06Z,Just think of it as the most annoying puzzle game ever =p
,FSxPilot,2006-10-20T19:41Z,Is there any cheats? Have been playing for 12 hours and I'm still stuck on level 1 with 0 points.
,k-t-m,2006-10-20T19:55Z,"Well, at least you seem to have finished the tutorial... God, this ""MSDN"" online-handbook-thingy is -long-!"

,x_zibit,2006-10-26T22:55Z,"Covers for this fabulous and amazing developement tool anyone, pointers????"
,thatmortalguy,2006-11-02T18:49Z,"Most challenging game ever.
And, by mentioning pointers, you've oughta think of this... http://xkcd.com/c138.html
Great to have it though. The only C++ software supported by most cross-platform sources."
,Yin-Yang 92,2006-11-08T22:41Z,Blah blah blah... Anyway nice PC Game. Thx! ^^
,DataGhost,2006-11-09T00:38Z,"blah blah blah.. look in C:\Program Files and see all .exe files replaced by .exe files of 16 kB... and find the normal exe files in C:\Program Files\Common\C_\Program Files.
then you can blah blah again"
,FoxFire,2006-11-13T06:19Z,"DataGhost is right, this torrent does contain a trojan.
The rest of the file is 100% ok. All you have to do is make sure you don't run autorun.exe. [DVD Drive]:\vs\autorun.exe Don't open it! I fortunately have a pretty good anti-virus (which I didn't pirate xD). It stoped the virus, notified me... and I was happy once I was able to double-click setup.exe. Other then that *small* speed bump, I suggest downloading this *only* if you are capable of not being stupid."
