,zax2000,2006-11-03T21:44Z,Anybody that can seed for short while.....we're stuck at 99.9%
,minotaur3868,2006-11-04T12:51Z,"Please seed, it has taken weeks to get to 99.9% now stuck there for days!!  Come on folks, keep with the spirit and SEED!!  Same with season 2 too, although thats stuck at 49.3% !!!"
,ambiquad,2006-11-05T22:59Z,"Watch out, I downloaded this and - not sure how - but NBC told my ISP that I downloaded it and I got a nasty letter.  "
,jdkullmann,2006-11-06T15:27Z,"I've downloaded this too, currently up and seeding from two different machines , one on the west coast and one on the east coast. both machines have 9097 pieces of the 9098 - 99.99%.  kinda makes me wonder if this isn't a planted torrent, esp in lieu of the comment by ambiquad. since my machines are tier3 colo'd good luck if those a**holes at NBC try to contact 'my ISP'.  if anyone that has this completed can seed it and i can get the whole thing (only one piece left!) i'll happily leave both mine up seeding."
,jdkullmann,2006-11-08T02:18Z,"Suddenly, on both my systems, after over 2 days, the missing single final 9098th piece came in, so Thank You to whoever began seeding a complete version of this.  I'm leaving both my systems up seeding this for awhile now."
,jdkullmann,2006-11-09T15:58Z,"For some reason I can't read the comments for this torrent right now, but, I did get the final 9098th piece and am now seeding this from machines on both the east and west coast. thank you to whoever reseeded so I (and others) could get that last piece."
,gabnxe,2006-11-22T04:03Z,"Hi, all.  I'd like to use this torrent, but don't really need a nastygram from my ISP.  Has anyone else gotten one?"
,edgecy,2007-05-21T19:36Z,Could someone please seed? Stuck at 95.4% :(
