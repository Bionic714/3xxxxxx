,Budge4,2006-10-24T06:21Z,"Vedran i've downloaded this torrent twice now and both times when i try to unrar the files i get ""invalid or corrupt authenticity information"" Im using winrar v3.60, just wondering what rar program you are using just incase its a winrar problem my end."
,vedran,2006-10-29T17:34Z,i was using winrar 3.60 also.. does anyone else have this problem?
,tom86,2006-11-06T17:52Z,"hate to sound stupid but where do I go once the file has copied to a cd, connection isn't the quickest and has taken ages to download so would really like to get playing. Also got the message about ""invalid or corrupt authenticity information"" but ignored it! Any help?

t"
,tom86,2006-11-06T19:09Z,The file name i no longer .rar but iso is this wrong? Where do I go from here?
,enaceo,2006-11-08T21:33Z,"You sir, are indeed a hero!
Thank you for this upload , you have brought me and a hole lot of other gamers happyness !
Some of the best games ever made...right here.
Now I just need ""First to Fight"" and I can die as a happy strategy player..."
,enaceo,2006-11-08T21:37Z,You are supposed to mount the .ISO with DT or some other emulation software.Don't extract that too!
,vedran,2006-11-08T22:05Z,"okay, why the authenticity information is broken - i have no idea, but it's irrelevant anyway.

the ISO's can be mounted with a program like Alcohol 120%, or burned on a CD.

then you just run the setup (or autorun runs it for you)

for Close Combat 1, there is a short compatibility guide for windows XP."
,vedran,2006-11-08T22:08Z,"once again - the ISO images must be burned themselves (as in ""burn image"" in Nero), not copied as a single file on a disc.

these are basics, but you never know.."
,Solipsism,2006-11-22T19:43Z,"If you like this, check out the fansite www.closecombatseries.net for some great neat and extremely well made campaigns. GJS and Stalingrad are strong recommendations. Meuse, Omaha are great. Der Kessel coming up.."
,Sgt.Crack-Ho,2006-11-23T13:32Z,"I've got a strange problem... When I play these games, the longer my computer has been on, the more the game itself lags. The mousepointer speed is unaffected, but everything else slows down to a crawl. I can solve this by restarting, but who wants to restart everytime they wanna play CC?!"
,fÃ¶r_fosterlandet,2006-12-01T15:23Z,plz seed! would be greatful if you did
,Urashima_kun,2006-12-08T22:39Z,"I get this strange thing happening when i run CC III   and CC V; atfer a while it says a pdl image coudnt be found, failed or something like that. How do i fix it?"
,Harvesterz,2006-12-26T23:35Z,"I think the  'Invalid or corrupt authenticity information' error just means that the rar file was created with an earlier version of winrar than you are using to unpack it. 

BTW,  THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THIS!!!"
,thosch666,2007-01-14T01:06Z,"Hi there! Anyone is interested in part 1?
so tell me please, before i seed-""!$§"
,Kaffatraktar,2007-01-24T23:49Z,"I don't get any of these games to work, and, yes, I've done the .iso part right. CC 1 is missing indeo 4.1, CC 4 the .iso doesn't work and CC5 is missing some file. CC 2 + 3 I already have... Might it be that i downloaded and burned everything on mac osx and or that I try playing them on win98? Any ideas anyone?"
,fallout11,2007-02-02T00:50Z,This works great! Thanks guys.
,Kojak00,2007-03-05T10:44Z,"The game slows to crawl whenever I try to play - it installs fine, but the lag is terrible - and I'm playing on a P4 2,4GHz with 1,5 Gb RAM with a Nvidia Gforce 7600 graphics card. What could be wrong?"

,Fenri,2007-05-02T00:29Z,plz seed... 3 days and i only got 56% so far..
,Sgt.Crack-Ho,2007-05-27T21:44Z,"FOR ALL USERS WHO HAVE CAN'T RUN THE GAME DUE TO LAG: Easy solution - just run the game in compability mode for Windows 98. Right click the .exe-file, ""Properties"", go to the ""Compability""-tab, check the ""Run in compability mode for...""-box, and select Windows 98. It should solve the problem."
,sweettalk,2007-07-09T06:28Z,"Hi everyone! I really wanna get started and play CC but dont understand how to do it..jepp i sukk!! well, first: do i have to burn every single CC verson on a CD to make it work , and will i b able to play the game on Vista??

,spittykitty,2007-09-01T03:45Z,"If the game runs slow and laggy on a comp with dual cores, you may need this file from Microsoft.

It's a flaw with XP SP2

It worked for me.

Alternatively, you can do a search at the microsoft website for the file. "

,Kevlar-Messiah,2007-10-12T09:53Z,"Ummm, I downloaded this but I dont know how to get it to download to the computer.  Do i have to get Daemon tools or what?"
,redhammer,2007-10-28T08:30Z,"yes you need to get daemon tools: www.daemon-tools.cc

Remember to read the manual though."
,redhammer,2007-11-13T14:19Z,"I get a ton of errors,  on install I get error on 100 percent where it says it cannot find cc5.sis on cd rom even though its right there in front of me...

Then when I patch the game, then put in the crack, I get all sorts of shit coming up, it asks me if I wanna use ffsid or something like that, and I dont get menu up or anything, what the hell?  I have the 150 mb download from Kazaa back from the old days, no intro videos, and that works like hell on xp, vista, whatever I install it on, but this install is just crap :S come on man check what u put out before u upload it to people and give false hopes..

big minus to u there"
,redhammer,2007-11-13T14:28Z,"Yep this is nothin but false,  I cant even get the game uninstalled, and now its impossible to reinstall unless I remove ALL registry files..  Thanks a bunch now I got a fucked up registry and the seeder doesnt even answer for himself through the entire 2 pages of complaints hes got on his ass.. I want this torrent removed.."
,Bestefar,2007-12-31T19:09Z,"CCIII installed all right, but I can't see any .iso-files or cracks, and the game tells me I need to insert the CD. What do I need to do?"
,vedran,2008-01-03T13:10Z,"i don't really care about you complaints, i got these games for my own joy and happiness. i played them, and i put them here bona fide.. if you're unable to get them running, don't bother me.... buy the games if you want."
,Divie,2008-01-05T03:04Z,"hey vedran thx for this wonder, I am unfortunetly a complete noob (see name :P ) when it comes to getting anything to work, would you or any other kind soul be able to give as idiot proof as possible a guide as to what to do from download completion to being able to play? any help would be greatly appreciated!"
,Divie,2008-01-05T22:18Z,"nevermind got it all sorted , ignore redhammer he's obviously done something wrong as all is working fine for me! thx again for this gem!"
,lauritzjr,2008-01-23T15:46Z,"this is great! download was a breeze, and installing the games was hassle-free, they all work great (didn't install 1 and 2 though, but 3, 4 and 5 works perfect) 
Thanx:)"
,noobd,2008-02-09T20:04Z,"It keeps telling me to put the CC CD in when I try to run Invasion Normandy. I even mounted the ISO on my virtual CD drive as well as the CC1 CD and it still says the same thing. (Yes I've patched)

Any suggestions?"
,noobd,2008-02-09T20:13Z,Well it directed it to my E drive and it finds it but then it says it can't find the /Maps directory... which is clearly in my Data folder...

,Hustaryin,2008-06-04T03:03Z,Hey thanks for the upload but I am not to sure what I need to do here.  Your instuctions say to start->run the setup with the CD.  Does this mean I have to burn it?  To be honest the whole point in getting this is not to have a CD. Little help please? 
,Pr0phecy,2008-06-07T22:02Z,Hvala ti care!
,polarbare14,2008-06-09T21:28Z,"Had to do some trial and error to get CC5 to work.  I am running WinXP.

This is what I did:

Install game from .iso (either burn to CD, or mount using Daemon Tools).

COPY the ""maps"" folder out of the data folder on the CD into the CC5 install folder on your harddrive.  Note - do not put the maps folder into the harddrive ""data"" folder, it needs to go into the CC5 directory (same place as the .exe file!)

Run the included patch. This just overwrites some of the files in the CC5 directory.

Do NOT use the crack that is included in the folder on the .iso file!  Tried that and it didn't work.  However the .exe file that is provided by the patch works just fine to execute the game."
,lemenos,2008-09-17T09:22Z,"Hello,

I am usually pretty smart at this stuff, but i can't seem to avoid the ""please re-install from cd-rom"" on CC2 after i install it....

i would sure appreciate some step by step instructions to get around this error, as i love this game!  

Thanks!"
,rickopicko,2008-09-29T18:34Z,"hi!

i install the game (cc3), evrything is seems fine (to be sure i install it with default commander name and so on..)
but when i try starting the actual game, i hear the gunshot when clicking the ""play game button on the pree menu or clicking the shortcut, i get a response from windows vista that the game has stopped working for unknown reaseon....


anyone..please,please,please help.
(using good cpu, windows vista, daemon tools)"
,koolio521,2008-10-26T17:23Z,"Vedran I happen to know a little about software, the game works in the end but you have done a real shoddy job with the Zip file. It means it takes 3 times as long to run and install the game etc.

Why don't you start a new seed, zip the files using a new winrar version or better still don't zip the Iso files at all, dl will take longer but at least the games will run like normal..."

,Bernardi6,2008-12-11T00:01Z,"Thank you so very m, Fucking Close Combat still rules after so long time. My xbox got broken and this saved me in dark winter time....going to Sovjet for the fights of Stalingrad...fuckin great :)"
,destromet,2009-01-15T05:08Z,"I'm mid download and I am so excited to get back and play CC 3, which i haven't played in maybe 10 years, but I'm very concerned with the amount of comments about it not working without any responses. So for all those who have tried everything and are still having trouble running these classics, odds are its just not going to work on vista. hope I'm wrong (or that Microsoft will pull its head out of its ass) and happy killing Nazis to you all."
,DCFGS3,2009-03-18T12:59Z,"I've installed CC II, and when I start it up, it says loading, then plays some intro music, with a black screen and then stays black. The cursor is the game's one. How do i fix this?"
,PacmanCrackman,2009-04-11T02:25Z,What a crappy torrent
,FiletOfBaby,2009-04-17T20:26Z,And I thought I was the only one to play these games back in the day.
,beleve,2009-04-18T00:15Z,"Thanks for posting. Been a big fan of these games for years, glad I can play them again.

Question: Everyone of these games install and work fine for me in single player, however, all five games have the networking options removed when I go the the multiplayer screen. Is that because of the crack/patch that came with it, or is it a Vista thing (vista 64, set to Win 98 compatability). Please help, this game is only fun in 1v1 multiplayer, single player is ok, but the AI is dumb as hell."
,slippery1,2009-05-28T23:56Z,"guys if your close combat is running really choppy or too fast, 

right click on the shortcut , click properties,  

go to 'compatability' tab, and select it to be compatible with windows95 and that should fix your problems "
,DNanoMan,2009-07-11T05:13Z,"excellent torrent. love these games. I already had CC2, so i didn't dl it, but it seems that that's the one that people are having the most trouble with."
,DNanoMan,2009-07-11T05:50Z,"excellent. haven't played them yet but are there any cracks for any of these, cuz i'd like to get rid off the .iso files, if i don't need to keep them."
,DNanoMan,2009-07-11T05:50Z,*haven't played them all
,doors420,2009-07-30T21:19Z,hey thanks to the uploader but i know for a fact that i installed everything fine and i can play for a while then i get a message saying something is incomplete and the game goes bye bye so vedran thx for the uload but you done fucked something up and p.s. when you responded to some peoples comments there's no reason to be an asshole about people just asking for help or trying to understand why the game doesn't work so there
,MechwarriorPuppies,2009-09-11T03:20Z,I commend you sir - I shall seed this infinitely. Loved these games when I was a kid!
,nadflactem,2009-12-10T07:48Z,"i mounted the game with daemon tools and pressed play, but it still says game cd is missing. i tried to browse for cd and select the virtual drive, but doesn't work. any ideas? thanks a bunch...."
,synchro_w,2010-03-22T18:10Z,"he he.. i still got alll my cds of these games. by the sound of it XP won't run them and i have to use older grfx drivers but install/run in win98 mode and they're ok. geforce card. old drivers seem to like old games. but that means you won't be playing Fallout3,Theatre of War2 or anything modern while playing CC games."
,hagamablabla,2011-10-23T05:06Z,"Tried installing CC1, but when installing it says ""The procedure entry point SUnMapLS_IP_EBP_12 could not be located in the dynamic link library KERNEL32.dll.""
