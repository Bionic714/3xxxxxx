,Karl Mundt,2006-10-27T11:01Z,"First of all, thank you very much for the upload, i've been dying to see another Tarkovsky DVDR. I have two questions though: 
1. how is 10.41GB split in two? Is one of the discs DVD9 and the other DVDR or are they both DVD9 with 5.2 GB each?
2. how long do you plan on seeding this? I've been downloading Stalker (8.4GB) for about 5 months now i think, still 2GB to go.

Anyway, thank you."
,FaderAbraham,2006-10-27T11:41Z,"It looks like there are two discs with 4,7GB and 5,7GB."
,Karl Mundt,2006-10-27T15:40Z,"I noticed that and it puzzles me, because neither will fit on 1 dvd disc. Is there some way you can use DVD Decrypter to extract both files into two VIDEO_TS folders and then somehow merge them together and split them into 3 discs? Otherwise i don't know what to do with it.

bi20, on how many discs was the movie originally on and were there any extras on it?"
[T],bi20,2006-10-27T15:42Z,"FaderAbraham is right.

I plan on seeding this until I uploaded everything, then I expect downloaders to keep seeding so other users can still download."
[T],bi20,2006-10-27T18:36Z,"the original came in two dvds. There are extras in both discs but they are quite small.

My suggestion is that you shrink each disc to fit a dvdr. Or you can join just the movie part into one DVD9.

I personally prefer to have the max information without any recompression of any kind."
[T],bi20,2006-10-27T18:39Z,"btw, there's also this torrent:

,BioSoiD,2006-10-28T17:30Z,Thanks a lot. :)
,strangelove9,2006-11-09T04:34Z,"Quick, really important question:

Is this made from the official RusciCo DVD? What is the source, and what are the characteristics? PAL? NTSC? 

I'm asking because I have the original RusCiCo DVD, but was curious whether this comes from another source, like Kino or the studios in Europe."
[T],bi20,2006-11-10T23:24Z,"I think it's PAL, and on the start of the movie there's a screen about the RUSCICO.

here's the link of the physical dvd:

,strangelove9,2006-11-11T06:24Z,"thank you, bi20,

I'm going to skip this, just because my Russian isn't so good yet, and I don't speak any Spanish yet, (there are no other available subtitles, unfortunately.) 

But, thanks for sharing! Tarkovsky's one of the directors who really deserve universal exposure and praise!"
,EmptyDoor,2007-02-13T15:37Z,"How long is this edition?  There appear to be several versions, and the one I have is 169 minutes (Criterion Collection)."
[T],bi20,2007-02-25T11:49Z,the link I posted says that this one is 160 minutes
