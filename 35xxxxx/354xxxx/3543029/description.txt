This excellent german synth group should have / could have / would have been as famous as Depeche Mode unless....yeah, that\'s right, why not?
Beats me, but good, they are.
UL:ing their 2003 album Sensor, deliberately ripped at only 128 bitrate to give you guys a promotional taste of their greatness, leaving the die hard synth nerds with a desire to go out and buy their album in order to achieve the full impact of an original recording....

Cruel?
Maybe, but if you like it, go and buy their records - you won\'t have any second thoughts.....
