Fixes the older version of the Halo 2 OGH map pack that had the launcher that would display an error message for some people.

Use this file in one of two ways to fix the problem.

#1 ftp this file with its current name to this address in your xbox E:/TDATA/4d530064/U$= this will enable you to run the game via the launcher if you wish and to also run it from the disk as is.

#2 rename this file to default.xbe and replace all the other xbe files within the OGH version of Halo 2 with this default.xbe, so when done you will have one clean and simple xbe file, the launcher will be gone and you can then re- iso the file and burn if you wish to run from the dvd .
