,-OLDBOY-,2006-10-17T19:30Z,"Sorry if im noob, but whats the difference between this fila and the other eng version here  on pbay?"
,enaceo,2006-10-17T19:30Z,"Already has a few seeders ,but it needs more .After you complete the download , please seed some more!Be fair to the community - this is a currently very rare item.Also, if someone with the game is nice enough - could they maybe check if any of the cracks on this page work ?  http://isohunt.com/torrents/gothic+3?ihp=1&iht=-1&ihs1=6&iho1=a Thanks a lot!"
,enaceo,2006-10-17T19:33Z,"Well the difference is - the other english one has very few seeders , and some of them are fakes.
Also, this one is in a different format , NRG (Nero image) while the other one is an image.And also , it will reduce the number of leechers from theo ther one , whic are currently far too many."
,PolishEagle,2006-10-17T21:22Z,"I acutally connected to a seeder, but since the other is like 72% it'll probably get done by tomorow. Still is worh a try."
,BesteN1336,2006-10-17T23:58Z,does this work in the same way as the other english image file? 
,enaceo,2006-10-18T06:29Z,"Pretty much yes.However , this one is a different format.But the bypass method with the german game should work the same for both of them."
,buzz_uk,2006-10-18T09:48Z,Is this with english speech or german with english subtitles. There seems to be copies of the latter floating around already?
,SataNXerxeS,2006-10-18T11:48Z,"can you guys make a miniimage of the one used to run the game? i mean to make miniimage of Ston3d (someone who already has it), so it will be like 50mb large and easy to download and it could be used to run the game.."
,enaceo,2006-10-18T12:26Z,"This is the ENGLISH VERSION -  english speech , english subtitles!
If somebody knows about that minimage,please post here too .I would also like to have it. Thanks!"
,enaceo,2006-10-18T13:40Z,"Please note - this image is guaranteed to get you in -game .If you want to play , it is best to get the save-games, then click on new game , in order to avoid crashes.Follow the instructions you find in the download.Also, this download has the patch , so no need to take that separately either!"
,SataNXerxeS,2006-10-18T14:31Z,"please, try to make miniimage out of STON3d big image. there should be some software on the internet which can do it....i remember that once i have read some guide how to do it. Just please make it and post it here, so we do not have to download two images (en and ger) to play the en version of the game."
,MrWise.dev,2006-10-18T18:31Z,"Alright, first of all get more reliable links in the nfo, the yousendit for saved games is already broken
secondly, the link you provided for Virtual CD 8... the keygen won't start for some reason (running winxp) and I couldnt find any cdkey, only one that makes the program not work cause it says it's a pirated cdkey or something like that...
also, if you don't have any physical dvd drive, you're screwd?"
,PolishEagle,2006-10-18T19:09Z,Doesn't the Gothic 3 by FZR have mini-image? I'll let you know if it works with vc8 method. I got the english to get past check but it said it can't load game.dll. >.
,enaceo,2006-10-18T20:57Z,"The NFO was not done by me , and yes I know the gen does not work.Just use the demo version from the internet , or get a cd-key from another site.
Also,the save-games can be found onf TPB."
,enaceo,2006-10-18T21:04Z,"and no , you're not screwed if you do not have a physical.VCD8 will still work like there was one."
,sadrax,2006-10-19T00:49Z,ive checked allmoust all of the crack.. alot of them are with viruses so be careful and the other seems to have som program that protects them against us(people who dont give a FCk for paing just beacause we have internet and god bless those sites with torrents) also i wish you good luck with searching the crack... but if you find then post an link or comment .. thnx all
,sadrax,2006-10-19T01:01Z,PS- it wont work cause the savegame is not awailable on this site... dont know myself what to do...
,Knugo,2006-10-19T02:37Z,"Read on page 8 what i wrote. It will help you :)

,setoroll,2007-04-24T18:34Z,where can i find a crack? or does it have one on the image? pls help
,evensteven1969,2008-05-03T17:11Z, Enaceo I noticed that you downloaded T72 Baltics on fire. Question. What do I want to convert the bin file too? I converted to an ISO file and it keeps asking for the CD. Do I need to burn it to a CD-R? Or can I burn it to a DVR?
