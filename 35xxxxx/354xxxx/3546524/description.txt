3 very usefull things.

1. PeerGuardian v.2
2. Hide IP Platinium v.3.2
3. Kremlin v.3

For noobs:

Kremlin is a dangerus Software, u can wipe drives or encrypt\\\\decrypt\\\\zip files like never before.
U can also delete anything, WARNING not possible whit todays teck to restore what you delete.

If u use it to encrypt files and u forget the password used, u are fucked:)

It can do a lot more, find out by you`r self.

Have a nice day :)
