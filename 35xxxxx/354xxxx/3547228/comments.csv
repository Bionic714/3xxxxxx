,RMCUE,2009-04-11T11:08Z,"There is no way an amateur pilot could have taken a big commercial jet 270 degrees and slam into the exact opposite side  of the Pentagon where Rummy and other big brass were sitting. Of course there also is no reason the FBI should have been confiscating videos in the area other than cover-up. And there's no way there shouldn't be clear videos from surveillance cameras around the Pentagon. I could go on and on, but the point is that the whole thing stinks to high heaven. If the government is covering things up, than there's gotta be something to cover up- it's that simple."
