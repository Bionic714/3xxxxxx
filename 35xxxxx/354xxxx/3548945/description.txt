I couldn\'t find any of Annie\'s music here, so I decided to upload some
stuff.
This is an remix album with contributions from Ralf Hildenbeutel, Sven Vaeth, Juno Reactor and others. Check the file list for further information.
If you really, really like this stuff go and get you the CD.
The files are all, as usual, encoded using the ogg-vorbis encoder.
I used the highest available quality level of encoding (10).
You may not be able to play ogg-vorbis files on ordinary mp3 players. If it doesn\'t play it, either throw it away and get one of the Samsung Yepp series (for instance) or try to pimp it with a new firmware. Just a suggestion ...
Have fun.
