,Crash0verride,2008-12-08T19:43Z,"Um guys? Is anybody else having issues with corruption? I downloaded three times, double checking file integrity the last two times. Many of the tracks have loud distortion in them, most notably is Kiss Of The Dragon OST, Symphony Pt 2. This is kinda crappy, and I hope it's some problem at my end, given the fact that the torrent's been going for over two years, but having re-tried, I still get playback probs. FYI, playing back on Ubuntu Rhythmbox, as-well as WMP."
