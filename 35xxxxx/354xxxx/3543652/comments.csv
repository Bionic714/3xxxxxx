Guess we're going for type of world record....
Your fingers are near your keyboard anyway, so why not type ""Thanks"" while you are grabbing this (and anyone else's) torrent?
Hell, if you're too lazy to type, simply save this page and copy/paste the above thanks in the comments section the next time you leech and run....
How fucking annoying....
I've been emailed a hundred times about uploading this torrent....you would think they could at least thank me....they sure as hell had the energy to type a request....
So c'mon people, post a thanks, etc the next time you grab a torrent....
Otherwise, people may stop uploading...
My rant is now finished.....
Feel free to go on with your day...

,birdcatcher,2007-04-01T12:16Z,"I downloaded this for the LOLs and there were plenty of them... it's a shame he committed suicide though, but why this ever got popular is beyond words. 

He sucks at singing... and I'm not bashing him.
it's the truth. I feel like people are showing him respect the way a kid with a learning disability are congratulated for saying the ABCs... it's not a great feat that is accomplished but you kind of have to give them props out of respect.

I have respect for Anton"

[T],Dark_Swordsman,2008-03-01T17:13Z,"Die hard vinyl junkie here.
What are you using to rip, etc?
I have tons of vinyl, mostly 60's and 70's-
A lot of ultra rare stuff.....
Any help would be appreciated..
Cheers 



sorry i didnt get your message until now..i been job hunting..wel anyway i use Micrsoft digital media Edition because it is easier to name the tracks individually after their cut...But I also been using something called..Total Recorder....and if you have a Soundblaster card...the software for it has a recorder...you have to get one of those wires with an earphon type plug in one end and rca jack in other end connected from stereo and sound card....i want to see other people put vinyls on pirate bay...in my book..its not about stealing the stuff thats out there in CD now...its about restoring what the corporare entity wont put out in CD."
