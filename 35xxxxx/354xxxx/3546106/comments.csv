Step back and see the bigger picture."
,tobberone,2006-12-12T14:24Z,"Why is there just sound on this files and no pictures? Mediaplayer messages that a codec couldn't be loaded, and PowerDVD doesn't give me a message at all... Just sound! Please help!"
,tuzmor,2006-12-12T17:17Z,"you have to download and install codecs
divx, xvid, ac3 filter etc"
,curandero,2007-08-18T05:57Z,Could someone please seed.  I have been at about 98% for days.  My bittorrent client says there are seeders but I don't seem to connect with any of them.
,tzimoun,2009-01-05T23:09Z,"Well I AM keeping this torrent seeded! 

It's very much worth it, and I just happen to have an uber-fast network connection! ;)

Respect to Alex Jones..."
,tuzmor,2009-07-02T11:36Z,"I uploaded this torrent years ago, keeping my computer on for months. I am so glad to see people seeding after all this time."
