2006 MotoGP title deciding race from Valencia, Spain.

The two contenders for the championship going into the race are the legendary Valentino Rossi, who leads Nicky Hayden by 8 points after the controvertial race in Estoril 2 weeks earlier.

This torrent includes the warm-up lap, full race, interviews in Parc Ferme, podium celebrations and official post-race interviews.

Video is ripped from a DVD, recorded straight from TV and so the file size reflects this. The image size though is as a result more favourable.

Enjoy!!
