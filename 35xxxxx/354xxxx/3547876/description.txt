My thougths: I was totally surprised how a simple movie like this moved me! The story is rather simple: as Japan is rapidly making itself a powerful industrialised nation, some of its people can\'t keep up with the pace.
Especially the people living in the countryside is suffering from the transition. A family has to make sacrifices in order to continue living.
A Beautiful movie simply told with the typical slow paceness which did not bother me at all. Infact I enjoyed every moment in the film. A young Chieko Baisho is absolutely beautiful!
A Pure masterpiece and definitely belongs in the A-list! Don\'t let the year of making bother you, take it as a vintage wine, the longer it preserves the better it tastes :)
