I'm stuck (and with two others as it seems) at 444.35 MB. I was looking forward to this one so please help out, and as it is, with the extra bonus of helping two others.
Thanks for your kind assistance!

To anyone who has had a problem with the English sub titles, just give movie and subs an identical name, except for the .avi and .srt
so the names preceeding .avi and .srt to be exactly the same."
