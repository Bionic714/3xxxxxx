Do UFOs originate as psychic projections from our own minds? Terence McKenna is the author of Food of the Gods, Archaic Revival and True Hallucinations and co-author of The Invisible Landscape and Trialogues at the Edge of History. He is a leading thinker in the area of alternative realities. He suggests that regardless of their origin and material existence, UFOs are a challenge to the authority of science. Their chief function, he says, may be to offset the rationalist imbalance in our contemporary culture.

DAT Recorded at the UFO Expo in LA. New material from Terence and UFO fans. The McKenna brothers came into our lives by way of a story telling session just preceding an ayahuasca event that took place down a remote dirt road in the jungle of Ecuador. But that\'s another story. \"Following Bracewell, Terence amusingly suggests, we are in the \"phone home\" influence of a kind of attractor from the future that is literally sucking biological time into something else.\" He says we are furtively searching for a suitable metaphor to explain what he calls the transcendental object at the end of time. This is a full circle tape, we started recording Terence when he spoke about this topic ten years ago and what a long strange trip it has been.
