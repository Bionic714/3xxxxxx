*** MOST OF THE WORK IS FROM garyOPA, even most of this Readme File ***

WHAT IS NEW:   Change booting order to counter-attack the fake ss that
               appears to be on some EA games.

I have not tried it since here on America we dont have yet any of this
games. In the worst case will not harm your box.

**If your drive is flashed USE A RESTORE FIRST**  
(Use the restore included on this package)


FEATURES (my contribution on this release):

* Removed old media detection and replaced with better media detection 
  (media detection ver 2) from Geremia. 
* Incorporates Maximus Firmware Stealth (Full Firmware Stealth)
* Added support for 59b firmware (what a stupid fw)
* Not yet Media Stealth... I have not heard news on this topic


Three Commands (for flashing use only one: Flash16s or Flash23s, no both):

FLASH23S.BAT: Flashes your drive with 2.3 Fw Stealth (Media Detect 2, 
              F900 core and Firwmare Stealth

FLASH16S.BAT: Flashes your drive with 1.5 Fw Stealth (Media Detect 2, 
              and Firwmare Stealth, (NO F900 Core)

RESTORE.BAT:  Return your drive to original State, even if you have
              firmware stealth in your drive


*RECOMENDATION: If you have flashed your drive in the past use RESTORE
first. If it is a brand new drive use directly the Flash command you 
like. If you dont plan to use your drive to dump games use the 
flash16s.bat

   - Included media detection 2 from Geremia and Maximus Firmware
