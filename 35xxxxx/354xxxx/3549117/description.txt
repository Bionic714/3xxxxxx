In the fun-filled series \'\'Growing Up with Pooh,\'\' Winnie the Pooh takes your child on exciting adventures where the greatest discovery of all is realizing how much fun it is to grow up with good friends around you. The adventure begins with four engaging tales that show how a little encouragement and thoughtfulness can turn the stickiest situations into bother-free events. Your child will laugh along with Pooh as his bothersome habit of losing things suddenly includes Piglet! Watch as the gang puts their thinkers together to try and re-route the trout migration. Then travel with Pooh as he gets his head literally stuck in the clouds. Whatever goes awry, as things often do in the Wood, these friends always find a way to work together and solve problems by sharing ideas and showing concern for others. They\'re just a few more reasons why Pooh and his pals are a child\'s friend forever. Bonus features include \'\'Cheer Up, Eeyore\'\' Game and Disney\'s \'\'Winnie The Pooh\'\' Sing Along.
