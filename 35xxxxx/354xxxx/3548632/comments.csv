,mafija,2006-11-23T21:19Z,"Nice work.Rippers must leave the DTS soundtrack in the rip,coz people is not only concerned about picture quality,they are very much concerned about sound quality too!!!Whats the fun to have a Hi-Vision quality film and crapy mp3 or DD5.1 sound when the DTS was presented but deleted by some scrooge ripper??
Still thanks for all the releases."
