A film noir (it is in black an white).
Thundercrack!\" starts out as a horror flick with some people taking refuge in a ghostly mansion during a storm at the countryside.Their hostess is one of the weirdest female characters ever shown on screen.Dead drunk,horny,delirious:Marion Eaton plays the role with a vengeance.What is the secret with her dead husband?Where is her son? Why does she keep human body parts in the cellar?It really doesn\'t matter much.Very soon,everyone gets involved in something much more interesting:having sex in every which way possible and impossible.Curt McDowell\'s \"Thundercrack!\" is easily one of the most bizarre porno films I have ever seen.It\'s shot in a black and white and loaded with raunchy hard core homo/hetero sex.The script is supremely strange and the acting is fine.Marion Eaton is especially memorable as a creepy Mrs Gert Hammond.I can\'t wait to see a fully uncut 152-minutes long version of this film.9 out of 10.

A combination of horror, porn, art,poetry and kitch. One of the weirdest films ever.
Please don\'t whine about the explicit sex content - this is not a film for the Porn section of this tracker. If your English skills are any good - good luck in decrypting the dialogue.
