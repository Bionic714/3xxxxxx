I've tried to unrar it to a dvd, do the hard drive....mount the image with Daemon tools and stil get the error about dat1.cab being corrupted....


How did you guys mount the image so it works??

Thanks"

When it doesn't work it asks me for odd data like bit size etc.  So I just use alcohol's virtual drive, mount the image and 'copy' from that disk and it works"
