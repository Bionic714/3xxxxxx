One 1.45Gb DVD ISO winrar\'d
Unfortunately the metroguide series is not routable on the GPSr, but does contain the same data as the Navigator series.
I\'m still looking for Metroguide North America v7 if anyone has it please upload it. Thanks!
As always, no unlock codes are needed for my uploaded Garmin stuff. Enjoy!
