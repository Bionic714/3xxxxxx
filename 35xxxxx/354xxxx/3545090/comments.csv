Please have the decency to hang around even for a day or two to allow faster seeding!"
,hardpad,2006-11-17T10:17Z,"Many thanks for this but could someone seed this please..?? Been D\L for 3 days so far - there's virtually nobody connectable {and I'm running 24\7] which is why I've only managed to nab a measly 72 mb so far...!! There's up to 3 leechers who seem to do absolutely nothing even when they are connectable [99% of the time they ain't..!!].

51 have apparently completed it - where are ya..??!!!"
