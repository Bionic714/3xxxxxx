,baabis,2006-10-26T19:24Z,Thx Mate :-)
,Proctologist,2006-10-27T00:21Z,Awesome!! But is this thing legal???
[T],stevekasian,2006-10-27T06:53Z,Hahahaha... legal - that's a good one!
,blankbox,2006-10-27T17:51Z,hmmmm.....is Proctology legal??? my dictionary definition seems awful kinky to me...
,blankbox,2006-10-27T18:36Z,"hey everybody...

If this bat seems to not run properly...DELETE THESE 2 LINES

REM Execute the ipconfig /flushdns command every 240 seconds.
REM You can set your own value to suit.

They are just comments anyway...but they might just confuse XP..."
,Panodilo,2006-10-27T20:25Z,"Do I need to do anything? Can the included bat be used? When I start it it just scrolls endlessly 'set your own value'. Sorry for being an autistic cock slobbering noob, but I must ask. What values worked for you, Blankbox?"
,blankbox,2006-10-27T20:44Z,"Panodilo
see my previous post....open the bat in notepad....delete those two lines then save.
should now look like this:

:START
ipconfig /renew
arp -d
nbtstat -R
nbtstat -RR
ipconfig /flushdns
ipconfig /registerdns
ping 127.0.0.1 -n 240
GOTO START

sounds like they are interfering on your PC"
,Panodilo,2006-10-27T20:56Z,"Oh, ok. And this bat runs in the background then.
It's scrolling renew. This is normal then?"
,blankbox,2006-10-27T21:08Z,"yep...in the background for as long as the torrent runs then you can close it..

ping 127.0.0.1 -n 240

I used the ping 127.0.0.01 command as a timer it will actually run 240 pings then reset. 240=4 minutes that's the number you can fuck around with ....just that it's the sweetspot for me"
,Panodilo,2006-10-27T22:40Z,"Excellent, Blankbox. Hey, you said fuck!! Ten hail marys!"
,Jackio,2006-10-28T00:09Z,"to Proctologist:

What on earth are you talking about?

If you want legal stuff, then what are you doing here? Here we are, fighting against the law on a site that was closed down due to being ""ilegal""
There are parties around the world, like the swedish pirates partie, and you are her talking about if a file here is legal?

Im sorry, but I have one word for you: w00t?!"
,blankbox,2006-10-28T01:22Z,...said ten hail marys....threw in a coupla mantras too.....now what???
