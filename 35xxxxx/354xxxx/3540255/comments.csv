Incl keygen or cracked?
Works OK?"
,Dolph181,2006-11-16T05:37Z,"The keygen isn't straightfoward at all. Something about a license manager, and I couldn't figure out the command line crap needed. HELP!"
,avatar1,2006-11-27T00:56Z,"Start the installation and generate a valid key for the install progress
Create a .lic file with the same key (use the keygen program)

Install the .lic file with the NI License manager
(c:\Program Files\National Instruments\Shared\License Manager\Bin\nilmutil.exe)
  ""options\install licence file""

hope this helps"

Unfortunately, then there's the topic of activation. There's no point to dl this because labview 8 has an activation procedure, which your upload doesn't deal with. This dl is a bit of a waste of time."
,iboinkin,2007-08-16T05:26Z,"Re activation procedure: This is useable as is (after crack is ran). No need for any thing else. I love to use my gpib hardware and TE with Labview! Makes a non programmer like me look GOOD!! 
Now if I could only get a date!"
,chuybi,2007-11-19T05:19Z,"torrent works. just a mistake in the location of the *.lic file

Wrong
Install the .lic file with the NI License manager
(c:\Program Files\National Instruments\Shared\License Manager\Bin\nilmutil.exe)

Right
C:\Program Files\National Instruments\Shared\License Manager\Licenses
""options\install licence file""

hope this helps "
