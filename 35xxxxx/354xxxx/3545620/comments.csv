Thanks for the upload ;)"
,NoName711,2006-10-25T17:31Z,"Episodes 9 -12 were on
torrent 3529747 of Sep 26, 06

Perhaps some1 still seed this one"
[V],Jag92,2006-10-25T22:06Z,"No, beacuse I downloaded it, and it was disc 1. Sorry..."
,captin_underpants,2006-10-26T02:57Z,"everyone that is looking for NoName711's upload of episodes 9-12 just use google and search for the file Lost_S2D3_new.iso - i found it at bitmon.com for some reason ??????????????? im still downloading it but i hope its not also Disc 1 - if you want to wait till ive tested it - then wait and ill post a comment if its the right one HERE!!!!! if its not the right one then ""NoName711 COULD YOU PLEASE UPLOAD DISC 3 OF PART ONE OF LOST SEASON 2 AGAIN"" ill seed it for months on end for you so you can upload the other discs of part 2. :P"
,NoName711,2006-10-26T09:49Z,"Hello,

Keep me informed, if necessary I'll up it again.

Otherwise i'll continue with part 2 of the 2nd season"
,captin_underpants,2006-10-26T11:34Z,"OK NoName!!! i'll let you know as soon as i'm finished downloading it!!! im at about 50% right now with a slow connection so check back now and then to see if i post a comment-i'll post it here on this torrent although i posted my previous comment on all the torrents from you - nice work on the compression, what did you use? DVDShrink, CloneDVD or something else??"
,captin_underpants,2006-10-29T00:20Z,"So NoName711 -- Jag92 is right, your torrent of  DISC 3 OF PART ONE OF LOST SEASON 2 is the wrong disc, its disc 1, it contains the episodes:

01 Man of Science, Man of Faith
02 Adrift
03 Orientation
04 Everybody Hates Hugo

the disc 3 of part 1 contains the episodes:

09 What Kate Did
10 The 23rd Psalm
11 The Hunting Party
12 Fire + Water

the best thing you could do is make the image (*.iso) file all over again, just to make sure you don't upload the wrong file again - give it a torrent name like ""Lost Season 2 Part 1 Disc 3 (9-12) PAL DVD Rip"" and a file name like Lost_S2Part1_D3.iso to not confuse the people to much, just make sure that in the name the episode numbers are included and i think nobody will have a problem. the important thing is that you check the image file to make sure its the right one before you upload it. ill post comments on the torrent with the wrong disc image so people stop downloading it. 

"
,captin_underpants,2006-10-29T00:36Z,"I just wanted to say again ""MAKE A NEW IMAGE FROM THE DISC"" because maybe you made the image from the wrong disk from the beginning and you havent relized it yet. load the image with something like DAEMON Tools and start it with your DVD program to see if it contains the right episodes!"
,NoName711,2006-10-29T09:55Z,"Hello Captin,

Today we're at 60% of Lost S2P2Vol4, if everything goes fine this one should be at 100% on Nov 1.

I'll seed Lost s2P1Vol3 from this day on, only then I'll continue with Part 2.

Hope this will fit everybody.
Sorry again."
,captin_underpants,2006-10-29T14:04Z,"Cool! thanks for the quick answer!! no need to be sorry- shit happens :( anyways it would be nice if u place a link to the new torrent within the comments here to redirect the downloaders to the new torrent or just to the page where all your torrents are - as a matter of fact ill do that last thing --- all of NoName711's torrents good and bad are here:

,NoName711,2006-11-11T11:41Z,"Hello, 

There are so many versions of Lost season 2 

available. 

Do you really want me to upload the remaining dics ? 

Your opinion please. 


Thanks 
"
,captin_underpants,2006-11-11T16:46Z,yes NoName Please upload the other 2 DVDs - it would be stupid if u dont - after all the time spent uploading the other 5 dvds u could at least finish the job- its only 2 dvds and that wont take so long
,NoName711,2006-11-12T12:44Z,"Hello captin,
Thanks for the reply. I'll upload the remainders, even if every disc takes about 11 days due to my 'high' bandwidth.
There's a forth disc with Part 2; another one of these ""Bonus"" discs to justify the money they take by splitting the sales in two parts.

Some maintenance to do, and I'll be back with Volume 5 within the next days."
