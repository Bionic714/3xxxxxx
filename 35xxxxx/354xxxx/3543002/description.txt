Rare stuff from british progressive rock band City Boy:

\"Turn On To Jesus\" - This single was stopped by the record company due to the lyrics. The new version was called \"5.7.0.5\" and became the band\'s biggest hit.

\"What A Night\" - This version is rare because it\'s the Bside to \"She\'s Got Style\". \"What A Night\" wasn\'t on the \"Book Early\" album to start with but was added on later pressings and then released as the follow-up to \"5.7.0.5\". This first version is not exactly as on the What A Night A-side single and album version.

\"The Day The Earth Caught Fire\" - The second most well-known City Boy song. This is the single version which cuts off before Mike Slamer\'s solo.

\"Telulah\" - B-side to \"Shake My Head and Leave\". Not release on any album.

\"Medicine\" - B-side to the \"What A Night\" single.
Not relased on any album.
