,chiguayante,2007-01-12T08:43Z,"Pictures of Chiloe, Chile. This is a really pretty place (I've been there) and it has a really rich culture that is slightly different from even the rest of southern chile. It's a lot different from Santiago.

Actual translation of original comment:

I don't think this is interesting for eveyone... because they are pictures of a very boring place in Chile."
