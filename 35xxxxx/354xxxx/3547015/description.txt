OK, here\'s the PROPER version of XBBMC FahxBahx. I accidentally included multiple copies of files in my other release. Hopefully this slimmer, trimmer version will work better for everyone. If you downloaded or are downloading the other version, stop and delete it. This one works better, and is MUCH smaller! I apollogize, and will work to ensure it NEVER happens again.


XBMC 2.0 10-27-2006 FahxBahx


I\'m back from my vacation, and I come bearing a brand new release just in time for the weekend. All those of us who use Daylight savings time, make sure to make the most of your extra hour! I have heard some scripts haven\'t been working in some releases, so I\'m going to take some time to weed them down and fix that for my next release. As per usual, there\'s MC360 and Manturafs & Roormonger\'s mods in here, along with some images roormonger put together. Remember, put the folder named \"LiveContent\" at the root of your E: drive. Well, I hope you all enjoy!
