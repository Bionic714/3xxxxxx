DCI Jack Meadows introduces new DS Claire Stanton to the rest of the CID team, who are jealous when she manages to land an eco-terrorism case on her first day. Someone has been injecting mercury into oranges as a protest against GM foods. Security footage shows a 'New Age' couple lurking around the fruit section, but when they are questioned, it appears they were stealing oranges rather than contaminating them. Supermarket shelf stacker Darren matches the description of the perpetrator, and when challenged, he incapacitates DC Proctor and takes him hostage. Locating his flat, the police find Proctor alive and well, but then word comes through that Darren is in the children's ward at St Hugh's armed with a gas grenade. SO19 arrive at the hospital, but DS Stanton manages to talk Darren into giving himself up.
