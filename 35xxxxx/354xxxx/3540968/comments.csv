,shoggoth,2006-10-19T12:39Z,"I would help you to seed this greet movie, if you seeded the movie until some of us had a completed download. Don't upload if you don't plan to seed to a 100% upload. Don't know why you take yourself the time to upload a torrent if you don't consider letting us download? Now it's just a dead torrent, and that's because of you uploading amateurs.

please, don't ever upload again! PB is full of this incompeleted pile of shit as it is."
,Enforcer,2006-10-19T14:17Z,"well, i have uploaded a total of 6.94gb with a speed of 80kb so far, the problem is that people leaves when they have dl, that makes it difficult to get decent dlspeeds, when iam the only one seeding.."
,shoggoth,2006-10-19T17:39Z,Then I beg your pardon!
,shoggoth,2006-10-19T20:27Z,"Sry for the outburst, I'll help you seed a couple of days."
,ninahartley,2006-10-20T02:09Z,"This was named The Beast Of War in sweden back when it was released on VHS. This is a damn good movie but I will not download it until someone shares it with swesubs. Dvd release is very considerate, but somebody should seed this with swesubs for those who missed this grain of gold.

,Vipersniper,2006-10-20T08:07Z,"Cheesus! Have I been looking for this or not?
Thanxx buddy! (2 bad it ain't Swe-Sub though...)"
,1qwerty,2007-03-04T17:47Z,"We need some seeds please, everyone's been stuck for weeks. Ty all."
,lamarpye308,2007-04-02T23:48Z,Stuck at 97%.....I'd seed it if I could get the whole thing!
,G_urr_A,2007-04-04T01:46Z,"Just thought I'd chime in and tell everyone that the movie plays ok even though you're stuck at ~97%. At least it did for me in PowerDVD after being stuck at 96.2%.

And, it's not as great a movie as it could have been. A couple of ""factual misstakes"", some irrealistic movie stuff (as allways), an attempt at making the afghans seem like idiots, and the fact that the russians speak american english detract from what could have been a fucking great movie. Now it's just a great movie."
,cray1000,2008-02-10T15:08Z,seed please
