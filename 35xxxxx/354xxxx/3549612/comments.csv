,scripp,2009-01-27T19:42Z,"macgyver2004, Please tell me this isn't a rip of her DVD ""En Concert"". Don't take money away from her hard work bro.

The DVD isn't expensive and it helps keep her making music for us. So if this is a rip of that official DVD I wish you would drop this torrent, not only is it illegal but you're keeping our favorite person from making the money she deserves for her hard work."
,scripp,2009-01-27T19:46Z,"Don't get me wrong the DVD 1 is awesome but I just downloaded and well.... DVD 2 is that official DVD she is selling.

There's so much FREE content online and here at piratebay of her live performances that there is no need to rip retail work she is selling and torrent it.

No worries I'm not the torrent police, just expressing my opinion."
,scripp,2009-01-27T19:49Z,"And before the negative vibes. Yes I own every single piece of official retail product she has for sale and deleted the DVD 2 part of this torrent after reviewing it. I did keep DVD 1 part because that is a brilliant piece of work for burning some of her best.

Not disrespecting you macgyver. Just expressing my own thoughts about this sort of thing."
,FPyro,2011-05-08T12:45Z,"Thanks a lot! Very nice girl. Please seed this more, deserves it, I think."
