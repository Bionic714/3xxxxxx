Description: Bergman\'s metaphysical drama of two children and their effort to survive the tyranny of their step-father. Filled with biographical elements of Bergman\'s own childhood and latent with powerful symbolism and deep melancholy this extraordinary film is an epitome of Bergman\'s entire opus. 

This is the original Swedish television mini-series clocking in at just over 5 hours, NOT the 3-hour theatrical release.  Enjoy!
