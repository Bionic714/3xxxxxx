,TheFirstMan,2006-10-27T13:39Z,Thank you VERY much!
,fredrik_muppet,2006-10-27T15:37Z,Thanks been loking for ever!
,kegir,2006-10-28T21:55Z,Great up Bressonian. Mabye I replace my old rip with this.
,Kalle Stropp,2006-10-29T17:01Z,Inget ljud?No sound?
,bressonian,2006-10-30T06:29Z,"Sorry Kalle, not sure what to tell you, I've played this on two computers and the sound is fine and haven't had any other complaints.  Only thing I can suggest is to make sure you have the latest DivX codec."
,fredrik_muppet,2006-10-30T16:23Z,Do You have the Making Off ?
,bressonian,2006-10-30T22:23Z,"I do indeed, working on something else at the moment but afterwards I will be more than happy to supply the Making Of."
,aluakonek,2007-01-07T19:23Z,"Thanks! The quality is also good in my opinion. Looking forward to the ""Making of""?"
,sterbe,2007-07-31T16:38Z,"Tack!!! (thx) For this one.
May you rest in peace Ingmar.
You will be greatly missed, by those who´ve seen your pictures and plays, and by those who have yet to discover your fine pieces of art"

,netza,2007-08-06T16:36Z,Thanks! But would also love to see the making of. 
,ured,2007-08-10T17:18Z,"Hi, thanks a lot. One question though: I can't see the subtitles. The .avi-file and the subtitles are in the same folder and I use Nero as a viewer, even though I add the subtitle-file it doesn't appear. Anyone knows what I should do?"
,tremello22,2007-08-19T11:23Z,I'm guessing  I should download this version instead of the movie version?  I heard Bergman wasn't too happy about having to cut down the movie.  
,heALer,2007-09-02T14:33Z,Var är tredje akten??
,Mr_Love,2008-02-08T08:17Z,"I was a bit confused myself regarding the third act, but it sure is included, in the same file as the second act.

To avoid further confusion, the parts of this long version are:

Prolog (Prologue)
Första akten - Familjen Ekdahl firar jul (The First Act - The Ekdahl Family Celebrates Christmas)
Andra akten - Vålnaden (The Second Act - The Ghost Rehearsal)
Tredje akten - Uppbrottet (The Third Act - Breakup)
Fjärde akten - Sommarens händelser (The Fourth Act - Events Of Summer)
Femte akten - Demonerna (The Fifth Act - Demons)
Epilog (Epilogue)


And this is how they appear in the avi-files:

Fanny and Alexander Episode 1.avi
> 0.00 > Prolog
> 7.31 > Första akten - Familjen Ekdahl firar jul

Fanny and Alexander Episode 2.avi
> 00.00 > Andra akten - Vålnaden
> 38.06 > Tredje akten - Uppbrottet

Fanny and Alexander Episode 3.avi
> Fjärde akten - Sommarens händelser

Fanny and Alexander Episode 4.avi
> 0.00.00 > Femte akten - Demonerna
> 1.07.08 > Epilog

A bit confusing with the fourth act being the third file, but that's how it is even on the US DVD release. (Yes, the long version isn't released in Sweden!)"
,mariod10,2008-04-15T12:17Z,"hithe same problem as URED
I have to merge the subtitles but need some advice how to do it
"
,hager530,2008-04-28T11:41Z,"Thanks so much. I'm rather an idiot with this but how does one seed? Doesn't it do it automatically?
And for this, how can I get subtitles to be on screen?"
,rohansingh70,2008-07-15T18:35Z,Thanks for the movie.Please seed.After the download I promise I will seed forever!!!
,rohansingh70,2008-07-22T05:31Z,The subs don't work on my computer nor my dvd player.Also they can't be converted using software like avi recomp or win avi.I am eager to see this movie.If you could upload with embedded subs or convert the subs to .srt format and then post the torrent i would be extremely grateful.
,exapporiton,2008-08-09T19:20Z,"First of all, thanks for this amazing torrent. I will seed this for at least a 1:1 ratio.

Second, for the people with subtitles problems: the subtitles work fine. Just use the latest version of the VLC Media Player from http://www.videolan.org/vlc/

And Mr_Love, thanks for the info. I'm actually going to keep your comment in a .txt file next to the film, very useful."
,Krokodilcheg,2008-10-19T23:20Z,"Thank you for the torrent!
Please tell me what am I to do to see the subs? I've downloaded the VLC Media Player and still there are no subs. "
,Blodigfisk,2008-12-26T10:21Z,"""This file does not appear to contain a video track""
Anyone else got this error? Tried DivX, VLC, Windows, Winamp etc..

Any help appreciated!"
,Cbswe,2008-12-27T03:45Z,What is the source of this rip? I've heard the TV-cut it quite rare
,123freud,2008-12-28T10:49Z,"Finally I did find this version of Fanny och Alexander, and now I'm stuck at 61,3 % - this is the first time for me in here and please (!) I promise I will seed alot if I only could get finiched with this download!!"
,mzimu,2009-05-07T07:20Z,"Hi !
Thank you!
I am having problem with English subs.
Whatever program I use , it tells me that it can't read the subtitles. Anybody have a similar problem?"
,apkonster,2009-12-19T00:58Z,"Stort TACK ! Ska seeda denna länge.
Har nån mer än mej märkt att Allan Edwall ser exakt ut som Hitler i filmen ? (inga liknelser i övrigt :)"
,Synskadad,2009-12-21T03:46Z,"Only 1 torrent uploaded by you Bressonian, but what an upload!! Them 2.74 GiB equals the same in TiB when it comes to quality! My Christmas is saved."

[V],DownTYU,2011-05-19T16:54Z,"Hello
I am a wannabe torrent reviewer...
I am really interested in sorting the bad apples from the good one.
I make judgements of torrents (movies)
in the mirror of 1080p quality

THIS ONE IS EPIC (according to the container avi and size)

P.S. If I make a wrong judgement plz comment on my post.
& if the uploader wishes to stop making this kind of review with siree's future torrents.He may ask me to stop and he won't see me again.

I have seeded exactly what I've taken, If I can so can you...Seed what you take.

Thanks"
,rocky619,2011-06-27T18:35Z,can please upload a rip in about 700 mb please!!
