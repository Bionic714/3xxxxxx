,Stenhagen,2006-10-20T10:25Z,No seeders :(
,speakeasy,2006-10-20T12:42Z,Very quick - thanks :-)
,foomonger,2006-10-20T15:25Z,"No, speed of dissemination is decided by the chunk size. rar files is just a lame jhangup from the days of ftp, and totally stupid for torrents, not least because a 95% avi is quite watchable, wheras a 95% complete rar is probably fucked. How many people have the brains to add a recovery record?

It's like people trying to fit movie rips into 700MB/1.4GB CD sizes. Lame. Lame. Lame.

[V],boze,2006-10-20T20:14Z,"Torrent protocol splits up the file itself and it works better if it is let to do what it does best. Splitting and checksumming. The RAR phenomena started on BBSes when large files was a mess to get home. This carried on to FTP and later on DirectConnect which also did not have any way of splitting and verifying as good as RAR does.

This is partly what BitTorrent was created to fix. So just add the files like they are and BitTorrent will take care of the rest.

RARing file on bittorrent is therefor annoying. If I get a movie in ten zillion RAR-files which I have to extract to get to the content, I will have to have the files store two times (packed and extracted). How long do you think people is inclined to seed then? If I can watch the file I have downloaded directly I can just let it sit there and watch it a few times before I decide to not seed anymore.

RARing files for BitTorrent therefor inhibits the incentive to seed and the torrents dies sooner.

I would very much appreciate if trackers could be given some influence in this matter to aid in getting people to start seeding just the files and not RARed, split files.

The one exception to this matter is applications containing many files. Those I would prefer to have archived in one file (zip, rar, sit).

Music and movies should be just the tracks/movie. And if it's made into an discimage it should be in a widly accepted format like iso or cue/bin. Not nrg, toast, clonedvd/clonecd or some other proprietary format.


That's my two cents. "

It wouldn't play in my dvd player put plays just fine in the Xbox, but that is probably the way I burnt it, I'm pretty much a newbie and this was the first .avi file I tried to burn so i guess i'm lucky i got it on the first try.

thanks a lot diamond!!"
