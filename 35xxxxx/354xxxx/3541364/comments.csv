,fanoxo,2006-11-13T20:38Z,"ooooh very nice man, thanks in alot"
,evilshenzero,2007-01-19T07:26Z,thanks a lot
,jtilly25,2007-03-09T17:39Z,wanted to know if the show was in english or just the subs?? Still trying to download really appreciate all you seeders and I promise to seed once completed.!!
,valz23,2007-04-03T00:03Z,"Hey, thanks for the download, but I'm having problem with the sound, only got the subtitles, what am I doing wrong? I tried using both Nero 7 & Windows Media Player 11, can anyone help?"
,monkiesatemybaby,2007-04-08T03:45Z,"I'm starting the dl now, I'll comment back if it works and i always seed for at least a week or two when im done...but i got my fingers crossed i LOVE farscape"
,sortalv,2007-04-10T10:11Z,"I know ppl usaly dont answer questions others ask but i am trying anyway just in case. 
when whole seasons is shared like this. is it posible to download just one of the episodes? i have all the episodes of farscape exept for 1.19 Nerve. and also a episode or two from the other seasons aswell. feels so sad skipping that one since so much vital for the ongoing plot is in it:( 
and even sader to have to download the whole season just to see one episode.
please answer me"
,monkiesatemybaby,2007-04-15T08:31Z,"if you download the file here you must dl the whole file...no pick and choose. my suggestion is to use shareaza or similar software to search for the specific episode you are trying to get, use the episode number or the title and look for results with several seeders or sources"
,monkiesatemybaby,2007-04-15T08:34Z,"oh and btw ive suspended my dl of this file because i found one with all 4 seasons and the peacekeeper wars all in one, of course its 30 gigs but im gonna try it for a few days and see if i can get it instead but if i do get that one ill seed it for a month"
,jabbrwokk,2007-04-20T22:04Z,"Got it in good time, all files work great on my DivX player, thanks for seeding.  Now I'm waiting for season two to download..."
,Alq,2007-05-25T14:20Z,"Thanks a lot, This show is very good."
,monkiesatemybaby,2007-05-28T19:13Z,"got it finished... took me forever but after tweaking a few things with my p2p client i got things fasted up and now im almost done with 2-4 too. i gave up on the 30gb 4-in-1 file it was driving me crazy, but these are working nicely now. i'll be seeding for a couple weeks more (usually about 12-16 hrs a day) so enjoy"
,monkiesatemybaby,2007-05-28T19:16Z,"oh and btw referring to a previous question that wasnt answered, the subs and audio are in english, but you can shut the subs off. and for some reason it makes a VOB icon come up in my taskbar if i watch the episodes in wmp, not sure what thats about, but it works great regardless"
,UsurperAdamas,2007-05-28T23:03Z,"Ya, I'm just not getting any sound. I dont understand why. I use VLC media Player to watch videos and its not working. I downloaded DivX Player but I still get no sound.

Could someone please help me? I really want to watch this. (and listen)"
,UsurperAdamas,2007-05-28T23:09Z,"I guess Ishould have waited 5 minutes before posting. I found a AC3 filter online, installed it and now it works fine. LOL I've learned my lesson."

,xx_messiah_xx,2008-03-17T06:41Z,"Just finished the download, burned to dvd and is in very good quality (although for some reason didn't fill the screen. 4:3 with a black border.) Anyway, thank you for this release."

I am using VLC to play this... but to make the captions disappear, you don't have to convert to .mp4, just delete or move the .srt files. That's all. :)"
