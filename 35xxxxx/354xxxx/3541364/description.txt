Farscape Season 1 TV-Rips with english .srt subs.
Yes, I know there are probably better dvd-rips out there now, but haven\'t gotten around to looking for them myself. 
But Farscape IS the best sf-show ever and damn hard to find so I thought I\'d share what I have for you all to enjoy!
The quality is very good anyway, so I don\'t think anyone will be disappointed with that :)

If this ends up being popular I\'ll consider upping seasons 2-4 later on.
I\'ll seed as much as I can, but will probably be offline a bit now and then the next few days, just got my new 100/100mbit and I\'ll have to get it running on my other computers, get new networkcards etc.
