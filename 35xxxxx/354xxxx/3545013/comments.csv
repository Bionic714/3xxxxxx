,csilvano,2006-12-17T02:27Z,"How do I uncompress this file?
IÂ´ve tried to use winrar on the .part1 but the program returns an error:
""Unknown format or corrupted file""

Did anyone uncompress this file?
There is something strange about the subtitles as well, the subtitles are ASCII files with texts like:
@AÂŹs]Z"
,frankcass,2006-12-19T16:25Z,"Files corrupt even the sample

Don't waste your time with this."
,alienzen,2006-12-19T22:01Z,OK I took the chance that maybe this was gonna work. Why do people waste my time with this crap??
,kongdvd,2006-12-29T05:54Z,"RAR files for both CD 1 and 2 are corrupt, also the sample fails. Could not repair RAR archive with Advanced RAR Repair. Waste of time. 
How about another upload, kultik4?"
,x6502,2007-01-04T01:23Z,This torrent is corrupt. The files are just garbage. What the hell?
,larryman,2007-01-07T14:36Z,All the files are corrupt! THIS DOESNT work me! ..and obviously the same for many other also!!
