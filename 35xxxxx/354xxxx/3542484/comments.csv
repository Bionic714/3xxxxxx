,broadsword1982,2009-01-08T23:32Z,"I don't understand why the subtitles are inserted!!!
No possibilities to watch this movie without subs, and if you are a spanish born speaker, isn't funny to have english subs all the time!!!"
,geluclei,2010-02-06T07:33Z,It's the Almodovar's 1992 movie with Penelope Cruz and Javier Bardem?
,IvortTheBoneless,2011-03-15T15:05Z,Why the quality of this movie is so poor? Isn't a real DVD?
,nemosrings,2011-06-09T02:57Z,"My guess is it's been ripped from DVD, had the subtitles burnt into the video with some software, perhaps during the re-burning process. In other words, this is not a direct copy of the original DVD. And maybe it's also been shrunk from a DL DVD-8 to the smaller DVD-5 disk."
