If somebody have problems with traffic dissapearing, please, go to the official forums and see the solution there. Is something related to the paths of the files. Also thereÂ´s a patch there.

REQ: Vector X Europe as seen on Newsgroups.

Tnx again!"
,jabbaru,2006-11-01T13:13Z,"just out of curiosity, does there need to be any serial, online registration or the likes ? or has this version already been cracked ? "
,Ethanor,2006-11-01T16:09Z,Is this compatible with fs2004?
,4X-AXG,2006-11-02T23:47Z,"no serial needed, no registration or anything, and no it's not FS2004 compatible..there is a new version for FS2004 as well, if needed I can upload that one here as well"
,Ethanor,2006-11-03T08:24Z,"4X-AXG, would be great, i don't have fsx yet. Thanks."

,Competa,2007-06-28T10:07Z,it works for me ;) lucky me...
,zoidzoid,2007-07-04T02:48Z,"In my opinion, this AI package is not that impressive and not that easy to install given it is actually payware. ProjectAI for FS9 was great, and I'd wait for them to finish their FSX version; I don't get charging $40 for a piece of software that doesn't even come with a proper installer."
