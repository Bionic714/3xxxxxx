By request I'm uploading the audio cd which came with the Beautiful Voices 2 DVD from Nuclear Blast. By the way, the menu song is song number two on this album :) See file list for details.
Really good female fronted gothic rock and metal anyway :)

This is also a kind of experiment, I've never managed to make torrents with more than one tracker and got it to work. Hold your thumbs :)

Get the dvd here:
