Playboy should be outlawed!
Surely we are all intelligent enough not to consider women as objects?"
,lordtarl,2006-11-02T04:44Z,"You are so right. Women are not objects.
But their boobies are! WOO HOO!"
,Panodilo,2006-11-02T16:13Z,"Hey... Playboy is prestige. It's been a stepping stone for many great careers. It's not like flashing your pink grotto in Hustler, only to fade into oblivion  once the next issue hits the stands. Even if you don't hit it big after a Playboy spread, you will forever be honored in the wanking fantasies of military servicemen all over the world. Women as objects? Pussy, a hard cock and a box of Kleenex beats political correctness any ol' time."
