After spending many hours joining the various wma found around the net I\'ve made a decision to make this final torrent including all XFM shows with correct ID3 tags so adding them to WinAmp, iTunes, WMP etc. should be very easy.

Example:

Title - Artist - Album

XFM - Episode 01 (November 10. 2001) - Ricky Gervais, Stephen Merchant and Karl Pilkington


92 episodes in total and each shows length is about 1 hour.

All episodes are in mp3 format where the joined files are encoded in 128kpbs and the already completed episodes are in its original state which is 64kpbs. 

These radioshows includes features such as;
-That Film Sounds Good
-Rockbusters
-Songs With a Phrase
-Monkeynews
-Do We Need \'Em.


The podcasts from Guardian Unlimited and the recent ones are not included in this collection. Buy them instead on Audible or iTunes. 

I\'ll keep seeding this torrent for a long while.

For all of you who haven\'t got a clue to what this is, I suggest you read something on the web about the recent podcasts and especially something about the phenomenon Karl Pilkington.
