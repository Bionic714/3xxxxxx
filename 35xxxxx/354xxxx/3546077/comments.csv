,afh,2006-10-27T03:01Z,"this is by far the best torrent on this site. 
cheers for that"
,jjjam,2007-01-05T19:36Z,"Just to say thank you so much for this! 

I'm completely new to this - I just spent pretty much a full day going through the XFM/ Ricky Gervais archive, streaming each little bit, and recording it simultaneously before thinking - hang on, someone must have already done this... which led me to find out about BitTorrent, and get this. 

So thanks again for saving me about a week of sitting in front of the computer and getting up every five minutes so start a new stream.

,Galeah,2008-05-17T16:34Z,"Thanks, this torrent is perfect!"
,trxonspeed,2008-09-16T19:59Z,Alright. Just wanted to let you know that I appreciate this a lot. Good work and that. Alright?
,JacobProject,2008-11-06T02:28Z,"Great collection, all tagged correctly and dated, which is fantastic. My only concern is of the quality - while most are 128kbps which is more than adequate for voice recording, there are a handful from season 1 and 2 that are 32kbps, and episode 6 is 16kbps - almost unlistenable!

I understand though that these were recorded from a streaming web source so if thats the best quality available, then fair enough - but why the inconsistency? 

Anyway, thank you very much for your hard work collecting all this together, and sharing!"
,Buccket,2008-12-10T22:29Z,"Thanks man. 92 hours of the phenomenon thats called Karl Pilkington.
