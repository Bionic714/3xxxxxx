,Doffsing,2006-10-20T17:43Z,"I've waited so long for this, thx!"
,bobzter,2006-10-21T02:50Z,"I've downloaded the "" Gothic 3 ENG MDS Torrent DVD"" - torrent, which is just an image of the game and installed it with that. Now that I try the update and crack in this torrent I get the errormessage: ""The application or DLL C:\games\Gothic 3\SHW32.DLL is not a valid Windows image. Please check this against your installation diskette""

I've tryed absolutely everything with this game. Can't get it to work. Just waiting for the full razor torrent to be done and are hoping that that will work.

Please help!"
,AboBeX,2006-10-21T22:31Z,Spelet ser mycket krävande ut lol :S
,AboBeX,2006-10-21T22:32Z,"Hur fan kan spelet bara vara 61,27 MB lol"
,Crater_Face,2006-10-22T13:40Z,"AboBeX: ""Hur fan kan spelet bara vara 61,27 MB lol""


Hur dum är du? Denna torrenten är inte spelet, läs vad den heter och försök luska ut vad det kan vara."
,zephyr.02,2006-10-23T03:59Z,"Ppl, this game is terrible...it honestly isn't worth your time or bandwith to download, let alone purchase from a retail outlet.  It's possibly the the most broken game ever...quests are difficult to understand, npcs are unpredictable and the combat system is overall increadibly frustrating.  You want my advice? Don't waste your time... "
,Farook,2006-10-24T23:04Z,OK first off numb nuts (zephyr.02) this is one of the most waited RPG by the world community of Gothic Fans. If it ran so bad on your system update your system because this is a demanding game. I will spend as much time as i can getting this game to work and if it doesnt when the US is released i will buy as i have the other 2. So again keep your ignorant stupid comments to yourself.
,zephyr.02,2006-10-25T00:10Z,"That's great, thanks for the immature name calling there Farook.

Let me help you understand a little more about my system which you say needs 'updating'.  

I have an Athlon 64 X2 Duel Core 4200+ on a Asus A8N32-SLI mobo with 2 Gigs of Corsair XMS DDR Ram and a Asus Nividia 7900 GT Vid card.  

Secondly, my comments have nothing to do with display quality of the game, they're about the faulty game play mechanics. So I have no idea what you're talking about...

Lastly, everything I stated was an OPINION that I don't expect everyone to agree with.  Don't go around attacking other people just because they don't agree with you. It just shows a lack of maturity."
,Farook,2006-10-25T04:32Z,"""Don't go around attacking other people just because they don't agree with you. It just shows a lack of maturity.""

And hence thats your opinion. I'll attack anyone's opinion because i live in the USA here we have freedom of speech where we can attack other people's ignorant opinions like ""npcs are unpredictable and the combat system is overall increadibly frustrating"" Obviously you didnt reant the manual i know this for a fact because when i first got the game (gothic 1) i felt the same way till i really spent time to getting to know the game. Every game is not a console game and you cannot spend 10 minutes on this game you really have to spend a decent amount of time getting to know the game. If you dont have patience or just suffer from A.D.H.D like you do you wont get very far. RPG's you have to spend the time on anyway. So the time factor which you stated ""your time or bandwith to download"" is worth it. Most fans of this game would wanna hit you in the head with a shovel for saying that. This is a very complex rpg and well worth the money buying. Believe me i've played almost everything rpg that comes out including mmorpg's i have 6 level 60's on wow. Oh and your system is Average at best. I have SLI Congifg 7800gt. 4 gig's of geil memory. my memory ran me $600 alone nub. gforce sli board i forget the name. 2 200 gig hd (i do video editing). Your system is already dated my friend time for an upgrade if you wanna play battlefield 2142 on full :P"
,zephyr.02,2006-10-25T08:28Z,"Well now, it looks like you managed a civilized and coherent response! Now we're making progress!

Look, I don't care how much you or any of you fans like the game, that's not what it's about.  If you didn't like my mini 'review' why didn't you just write your own saying otherwise? You obviously are very experienced with the series/game...who knows maybe you could even convince me to re-install the game. But instead you resorted to petty insults, as if that will prove your point..."
,Rikoko,2006-10-29T16:24Z,"Kids kids kids, we all do not care about your quarrels with eachother,

as it are always teens that THINK that they know what mature is or not.

Seriously, we do not need such useless comments like that.

On topic:

We need a new patch c|24ck  for v1.08"
,leviticuz,2007-10-24T01:35Z,"""I have SLI Congifg 7800gt. '4 gig's of geil memory.' my memory ran me $600 alone nub. gforce sli board i forget the name. 2 200 gig hd (i do video editing).""

Thats funny, since Windows XP (since I highly doubt your minimalistic brain could handle Linux) only supports 3gb of ram... You've wasted money on an extra gigabyte of memory that your system does not even recognize. And you say that zephyr.02 is the ill informed one of the conversation. Pitiful at best.

And yes I commented on a year old torrent just because the verbal attacks between zephyr.02 and Farook were childish and unlike Farook zephyr.02 actually structured his comments well with intelligence and meaning. 

That and the fact that I just love when other people from the United States of America automatically assume that whoever they are not in agreement with are from other countries or backgrounds. Contrary to popular belief Farook our country is the worst country on the planet. Our education system is practically nonexistant we are enslaved by the IRS which is not even a governmental entity. My fellow countrymen are blind to the falsehoods and lies that our leaders have been subjecting us to since even before the 1900's. You project that you feel special since you have so many after market performance parts in you computer, and that makes you superior? Well unfortunately, our money is backed by nothing. Absolutely nothing. Our money is printed by a central bank called the Fedral Reserve System which inturn owns the IRS. We do not have any gold backing up our currency. We wage wars under false accusations of crimes against humanity, we stage threats on our own peopl and we kill thousands of innocent civilians in countries all over the world. So thus, we the US, are no better than anyone. We are worse than most of the world population.

So please enjoy living in that fantasy world of how our country is the be all end all of all mankind. I hope you figure out it all a lie before the world comes crashing down all around you."
