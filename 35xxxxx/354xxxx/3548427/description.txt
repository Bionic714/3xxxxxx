To play KotF you must have Jedi Academy and its 1.1 patch on your PC installed.

Download: http://www.lucasfiles.com/index.php?s=&action=file&id=235 

Furthermore this is very important 

* You must direct the folder adress of Jedi Academy Correctly. 
e.g.: "C:\Games\LucasArts\Star Wars Jedi Knight Jedi Academy/" 

* Never direct to "gamedata or "gamedata/base" folders otherwise demo won't work and you will get an error. 

* Empty the base folder. make sure nothing has left except the original files. 

* To get hints about the levels check out the "Options > Tips & Tricks" part in CD menu. 

* Some of anti-virus programs find the file named cmdow.exe 
inconvenient which is helping cd menu to run but i assure you its not a virus, dont worry about that. Besides a broad explanation about this subject can be found here: http://www.commandline.co.uk/cmdow/ 

* If you get TrojanDropper.Win32.QuickBatch.c error about kur.exe just ignore it. after you click install that file operates, and since it makes installation secretly anti-virus programs can sense it differently. its not virus or trojan. after installation finished file is useless.. can be deleted if liked 

* Please everybody take a look at here before playing, some answers lay there. Options > Tips & Tricks" part in CD menu.
