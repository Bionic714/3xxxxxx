,parquedematt,2007-06-02T18:16Z,I think there are alot of PB users who are submitting mis-information to keep people away from certain torrents (RIAA?).  Most of them have never uploaded anything and can be seen saying the same comments on multiple torrents.  Pitiful.

,vivatpb5776,2011-08-16T10:45Z,"Not sure what heavyweight was smoking but he should definitely stay off the sauce...

This is the original release of 'Like Father, Like Son."" There are 20 tracks (.mp3), an album cover (.jpg), and an .url (torrentazos).

Please note that there is a Deluxe Version of this album that includes five additional tracks:

- Stuntin' Like My Daddy (Rock Remix)
- Brown Paper Bag
- Neighborhood Superstars
- I'm Ridin'
- Shooter

These tracks are NOT included within this .torrent. However, I am sure they are all easily accessible somewhere else. Thank you uploader."
