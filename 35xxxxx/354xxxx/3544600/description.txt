Kvalim (1992, Hebrew)

Starring: Tzvi Shissel, Arik Einstein, Moni Moshonov

The IMDB entry explains the premise. The movie is (mostly) in Hebrew and is not available on DVD as far as I could tell. It is a VHS capture, hence the limited quality. I did my best to crop/enhance/color-correct the files. The movie itself came on 2 videocassettes (in PAL), so the upload contains two XVid files. I kept the commercials in the beginning for nostalgic value.

Enjoy.
