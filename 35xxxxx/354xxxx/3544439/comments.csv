,gandalf95,2006-10-23T20:09Z,is there any way to change the format from .zip to .dmg? it doesnt open for me when it is zip..
,kervich,2006-10-23T21:09Z,"gandalf95, simply run ""unzip filename.zip"" from the terminal and then open the unzipped .dmg file. Although ctrl+click and selecting 'open with->archive helper' should work too."
,RAAAARGH,2007-04-19T01:12Z,Man if someone seeds for like 10 minutes I'll be done and seed for days.

,mraard,2008-04-19T16:34Z,is this full or demo?
,archon.thelawgiver,2008-04-20T05:19Z,"I to would like to know if this a demo or a full version. What I can say that after putting my forefinger under a heap of strain I managed to storm my way into the second level.

This game absolutely rocks.  I recommend it to anyone with a half-way decent processor and video card.

Colours explode and smoke trails beautifully on-screen. The music rocks but I suspect that as time goes on I may get really sick and tired of it. However, as a game for mac users I'd give it four out five. One mark off for the default volume being way too high  and the music that WILL become grating over time. 

"
,archon.thelawgiver,2008-06-07T08:51Z,"This is a demo of the full game. The file on this link is  around 72 megs and the full game is 75 megs. However the full game costs a mere $US20.00 and is worth every cent. This game rocks. 

In the full version you have access to a number of different weapons which are crucial in  advancing the rough the various levels. 

I've got to get back to this game?I need to shoot some more nasties. Arrgh, I'm so addicted to this game"
,MacRockLive,2008-10-05T08:16Z,archon.thelawgiver upload the full version for us PLEASE!!! i love this game! im sure others would like to play it too!
