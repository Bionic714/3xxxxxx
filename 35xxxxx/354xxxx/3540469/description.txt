Tune in to CHMR(93.5 fm) Sundays from 10-1am for Apocalyptic Raids. Three hours of Crust, Grind, Power Violence, Thrash, H/C, Black Metal, NWOBHM, Crossover, Folk, and Punk Rock

This week I\'ll be playing:
Hexx-Kick ass 80\'s metal in the savatage vein
Trioxin 245-Ottawa based spiky punx
Demontage-Toronto Black Thrash
Disembowelment-Brutal Australian Heshers
Aura Noir-Black Thrash from Norway

Also this week I\'ll be continuing my look at \"Old People Who Rock\", and doing an album spotlight on Wire\'s 2003 reunion record \"Send\".
Send was the first full length Wire record since 1991, and I would argue it\'s their best since \"154\" in 1979.
Gone is the middle of the road \"mature\" pop of their late 80\'s early 90\'s incarnation. Replaced with a kick ass rock approach Wire had never used before.
And it works.
Tune in and check it out.
