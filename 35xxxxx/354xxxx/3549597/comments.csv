,XweAponX,2010-05-18T19:30Z,"This is my Favourite Original Cast ST Moooovie, saw it in the theatre about 5x! Good supporting cast, David Warner as big cheese Klingon was cool even though he had already played a drunken politician in the Shatnet-Directed ST:V (Which was allright, its the most underrated of the original cast moovies). They made the Klingons SO cool, even gave the Homeworld a name (qo'nos)"
