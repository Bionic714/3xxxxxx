I would like to give you a present: the rare Cyberwar from SCi, sequel of The Lawnmower Man!

- three game cd (cue/bin)
- bonus audio cd (flac)
- high res artworks (box, case and the 32 pages manual! in pdf)
- configured DOSBox (run and play)

I have just a slow ADSL connection (12kb/sec) so be patient and help to seed! Enjoy!
