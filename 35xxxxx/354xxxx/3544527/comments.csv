,Yrgal,2006-10-23T20:34Z,"First off, this is NOT virtually everything she did, and I'm actually glad you don't know how to seed since this is a crappy ""all files in one folder upload""."
,hammerogod,2006-10-24T00:01Z,"Well..........

After what Yrgal had to say I doubt that I will ever seed anything again.
That was my first effort...it was not perfect.

However it was good enough for Yrgal to take it and make a few changes and reseed it under his name.

If I don't seed anything else it will be a shame.
'Coz I have some amazing stuff I really wanted to share.

I was going to share a 25 minute interview with Janice Joplin that I recorded myself and had digitized reciently..pure bootleg and pure magic...plus some other Joplin stuff that has never been released before...recorded by her friends.

I was a roady at the Whiskey A-Go-Go in the late 1960's...and this stuff has been in storage for nearly 40 years on 10 in. reel to reel.
The stuff I have is Jance talking to Eric Burdon (The Animals) and Ray Manzarek (The Doors).
And a few songs bits from some things she and Manzarek were working on.
Plus a comment from Janice on how she felt about Jim Morrison's stage presence.

Tragic that I may not seed that.

And my utterly stunning Robert Cray collection and my Meatloaf collection and my Joe Cocker collection will just remain unshared.

1 Prick can indeed spoil the picnic.
Thank Yrgal.

I owe you people nothing."

,dedoos,2007-01-19T00:32Z,"same story, new package.

Not to long ago I was reading the same kind of comments after my first upload. Like this case there were a few persons whining about my poor upload result. OK they were right about that and I do believe they must be very good in uploading. Because most likely that is the only thing they are good in. They did not read to follow instructions. They did not think to work around problems themselves. But most of all they did not realise the effect of their attitude. Here you have it. Maybe I am just in the wrong place, but I am wondering how such behaviour is called on sites like these in general?

,connect4,2007-03-29T04:50Z,Anyone out there willing to seed this...Please?  Would appreaciate it so much :)
,Vampchiq,2007-06-13T20:44Z,"See, it's inarticulate morons like you guys, that make intelligent, educated people like hammerogod and myself not want to even acknowledge your existance, let alone share anything with you.  Grow up little boys.  Hammerogod, thanks for sharing this, it's fantastic, keep em coming, I'd love to hear the Joplin interview. "
,t3hc411,2008-03-31T22:43Z,"I think it's perfect. :| Thanks for spoiling exactly what I was looking for, jackasses."
