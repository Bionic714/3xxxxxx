Installation Instructions:

  Most likely you\\\'ve downloaded or are downloading this torrent and are now looking at a folder named eliteace.  In which there is a zip folder called objects_server and another AI and a third named movies.  These are the modded files.  So the following steps will help you create a small mod that is somewhat parralell to the original bf2.  This is completely seperate from bf2 so in no ways can it be used to cheat.  why cheat when you can gun down bots by the thousands.

Instructions: in your bf2 directory (C:\\\\program files\\\\EA Games\\\\Battlefield 2) you should see a folder called mods.  OPEN IT.  next you should see a folder called \\\"bf2\\\".  COPY IT.  Now Past it in the same folder.  So now in the mods folder you should have the original bf2 folder, and a copy of it.  Next rename the copy to eliteace (don put ur own name, u\\\'ll just fuck it up).  Now put the files that you downloaded into the eliteace folder and OVERWRITE the originals.

TO PLAY- click your bf2 icon and load up.  it doesn\\\'t matter if you sign in or not.  next click community and select eliteace.  playa singleplayer game or LAN game and have fun.


OPTIONAL STEP (to make startup faster)

I did this to put in my own videos and bypass the communnity shit-

instructions:  COPY your bf2 icon and paste it right next to the original.  RENAME the copy to \\\"eliteace\\\'s mod\\\".  CLICK properties and paste in this segment in the \\\"Target\\\" all as 1 line.  If you run off a different drive or installed to a different directory, then you probably know what to do from here:

\\\"C:\\\\Program Files\\\\EA GAMES\\\\Battlefield 2\\\\BF2.exe\\\" +menu 1 +fullscreen 1 +modPath mods/eliteace +ignoreAsserts 1

CLICK apply. and double click the icon and test it out.
