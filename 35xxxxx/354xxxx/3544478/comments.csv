It disappeared from the net as quickly as it appeared; scientologists are working to remove all traces of it.  It's a sad story, really.  I feel bad for the filmmaker."
,apoptos,2006-10-23T21:08Z,"It was always free for download, but they even managed to get it removed from archive.org!!

Is this the whole film?"
,netslaveone,2006-10-24T10:21Z,yes it's complete. one hour length and good quality
,kyger,2006-10-25T20:15Z,netslaveone - it's a good thing you've done! thanks!

,Bishop0151,2006-10-25T22:54Z,I understand what the film maker was trying to do but I think that it falls a bit flat and isn't actually that informative. If you want to know more you would do better spending twenty minutes looking at http://www.scientology.org/ with your sceptic hat on and then checking out http://www.xenu.net/ for the more honest opposing view.
,Loueloui,2006-10-26T08:00Z,"Required viewing. That is unless you mean to be brainwashed by some weirdo cult. 


Excuse me 
Oh will you excuse me 
I'm just trying to find the bridge... 
Has anybody seen the bridge? 
Have you seen the bridge?

I ain't seen the bridge.

Where's that confounded bridge?

,netslaveone,2006-11-02T13:18Z,"two days ago i put an entry in wikipedia that the film is still available through torrent sites. Later someone even fixed a link for the word ""torrent""
Today was erased. Today I put it back:)

[M],Lollash,2007-07-19T22:06Z,could be nice if someone seeded it.
,BrokeProphet,2008-03-25T07:09Z,"As an avid hater of scientology I will seed this one until L. Ron himself beats down my fucking door and shuts my computer off...

,harigata,2009-02-16T12:34Z,"""Scientology destroys lives""

Yes they do, but they get ample help from the rest of our corrupt society. Our society, our religions and our governments spread ignorance as an instrument of power and mind control. In doing so they have created a niche for cults such as $cientology to thrive in."
,harigata,2009-02-16T16:06Z,"What a piece of shit movie.....

It gives almost no information at all about the cult. Just a removed tourist's view from a fast moving train.... well, it does make you feel that the $cientology sucks, but you're not quite sure why."
,youface,2010-01-19T16:47Z,"If the film hadn't used copyrighted SCN footage, or had stuck with 10-20 second ""fair-use"" clips, or had shot re-enactments of the copyrighted stuff, or had been released anonymously, SCN's ability to apply pressure would have been seriously weakened.  I liked the film, its production values, its style and its sense of empty futility, in spite of all its weaknesses mentioned by others.  Happy to seed."
,TaiTheGuy,2010-02-15T01:47Z,"FYI. The most intellectual, well-read, cultured individuals I've ever met have been scientologists. And not 1 of them were drug-users or alcohol-abusers.
That's gotta say something for them as a whole."
,TorrentReznor,2010-10-15T18:20Z,"Fuuuuuuck, why did you have to go and make it a Windows Media Video?! (.wmv)
That's basically like sucking Microsoft's balls.

Use .avi or .mov or .mp4 or .mpg
There are plenty of good formats available.

Now I have to download additional software on my Mac just to view this crap."

,chk.chk.BOOM,2011-08-11T08:26Z,"Thank you, netslaveone. Your efforts are much appreciated.

I'll leave you all with a lovely quote from our beloved L. Ron Hubbard:

""If a man really wants to make a million dollars, the best way would be to start his own religion."""
