,ImuL,2006-10-19T04:09Z,Är det så illa kvalle som på bilden som är typ 235x213
,furiousV,2006-10-19T04:12Z,"This aint episode 3 yet, is it?

I'm not expecting that for another hour . . . which would be about ~4:00am GMT
"
,Mr.Mustard,2006-10-19T04:13Z,no this isnt it
,furiousV,2006-10-19T04:15Z,"I'm waiting for a release that has XOR or LOL in its name . . . 

whatever this is here seems a bit fishy"
,guilhermem,2006-10-19T04:20Z,"It seems that mpeg1 encode faster. XOR maybe still encoding...

Now I got 1 seeder and 50 leechers without a single byte."
,themanalaa,2006-10-19T04:21Z,är alla vakna ännu...snacka om en bra serie..alla väntar zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzZZZZZZZZZZZZ
,OskarOne,2006-10-19T04:22Z,Is this really S.03.E.03? If so does anybody know if the link to the picture is the quality of the episode?!
,OskarOne,2006-10-19T04:23Z,"Fuckin' hell, I wont download this shit anymore... wtf is MPEG1?"
,OskarOne,2006-10-19T04:26Z,"And antoher thing while I'm at it, wtf is DB and RP... I know they are seeders and leechers but which one is which?"
,guilhermem,2006-10-19T04:26Z,"The crazy language chars of ImuL has 235x213 in it.

That's probably 235x213 pixes ;)

I don't care if it's Mpeg1 or WMVHD, as long is download fast."
,OskarOne,2006-10-19T04:26Z,Never mind I've got it!
,guilhermem,2006-10-19T04:28Z,"Geeez, not a single byte in 20 min!

150 seeders, all empty"
,guilhermem,2006-10-19T04:29Z,Next time I'll watch on live internet TV...
,OskarOne,2006-10-19T04:39Z,why does it take so long to put up the other verisions?!
,furiousV,2006-10-19T21:26Z,"""why does it take so long to put up the other verisions?!""

because the other version will most likely be of better quality, like LOL, therefore encoding takes longer."

,Chriss_472,2006-10-20T00:56Z,i think somethings blokking the search. you can find release from lol a other place
