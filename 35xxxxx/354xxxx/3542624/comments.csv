,Flying_Dragon,2006-10-20T19:43Z,"byblos, true fs2004 might run a hell of a lot better, but its a 3 year old ""game"". same thing is going on wich we had going from fs2002 to fs2004. all flightsim versions from ms are build for the pc that still has to be build. even now pc's are struggling to run fs2004 at max"
,smartuser,2006-10-21T03:55Z,"OMG I'm so silly, I search lyk all the time for fs2004 because usually all flight sim stuff is labeled that, didin't even think that fsx wasn't fs2004 lol!!"
,byblos,2006-10-21T03:56Z," I don´t care a shit if its a three year old title. FS9 is here to stay mark my words. FSX is for archide game kids, while FS9 is for serious simmers. If you can show me even one single proof of that FSX changed the system variables on the commercial airlines, I am humbled to agree with you. But I am sure you will not be able to show me even one tiny proof of that. LOL"
[T],stevekasian,2006-10-21T04:29Z,"I agree - the argument that it's unfair to compare a stock FSX to an FS9 install with 50GB worth of add-ons is ludicrous.
FSX comes with most of those add-ons included, like high-res terrain mesh and photomesh sceneries, so that arguement is basically moot.
The main advances/differences I see in FSX over FS9 are limited to the following:
- Improved long-distance terrain/sky/clouds/atmosphere/ rendering.
- Default views are set to a lower FOV in FSX than in FS9 (i.e. Zoom=0 in FSX is equivalent to Zoom=3x in FS9.)
- Smoother ""eye movement"" with the spacebar panning deal than is achievable with a similar effect in FS9 by using the mouse scroll button and panning.

THAT'S IT!  Sure it's got lots of power to go beyond FS9 in the display settings, but the fundamental limitations of FS9 have not been improved upon one iota. The number one factor limiting performance in FS9 is the way the graphics are loaded from disk. Increasing the burden on the machine by increasing scenery element resolutions, without addressing the main bottleneck issue, doesn nothing but decrease performance. It makes it impossible to get a clear view around your aircraft because the sim is busy playing catch-up on the graphics being loaded.
Bottom line is, the scenery engine needs a complete overhaul by programmers utilizing forward thinking ideas and concepts, a concept in and of itself to which Microsoft is completely oblivious, and completely uninterested in. Stifling innovation is what MS has proven it's strong point to be in the software industry. It's what they do."

thanks!!! "
[T],stevekasian,2006-10-29T14:43Z,"Sounds like you've got major probs. with your OS. IRQs have to do with in/out devices - Could be bad video driver(s) though. Update to the latest drivers for your video card. Disable some shit in ur BIOS like the blue-screen error page probably tells u to.
Other than that, it's impossible to troubleshoot w/o working with the box in person.
Try a fresh install of Windows. Install FS9 (and only FS9, along with your DVD emulator and/or other necessary support apps) on that OS installation and try it again. If it still craps out, U know it's your drivers and/or hardware setup... cuz unlike FSX, Windows XP actually works somewhat. (lol)
Good luck...

CRACK INSTRUCTIONS:
IN ORDER TO KEEP THE F'N APP FROM ASKING YOU TO INSERT CD4, ETC., YOU MUST APPLY THE CRACK.
Once you mount the ISO image to a virtual drive/burn the ISO image to a CD/DVD/whatever, you need view the directory tree of the image with Windows Explorer/whathaveyou and look for the folder entitled ""CRACK"". Look inside the folder and you will see a .txt file. You must open this .txt file with Notepad or other text viewer and read it very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very CAREFULLY.

,doitright,2008-08-01T05:06Z,"Okay, download a free program to unpack the .rar files you downloaded with the torrent.  Run only the first .rar file in the unpacking program.  Find the output files and there should be four ISO files of CD1, CD2, CD3 and CD4.  These ISO files can be burned to a disk in Nero (which can also be found on piratebay).  Once you have all 4 disks burned, install them, starting with CD1.  Once they are all installed, the program will continually ask for CD 4 to be inserted when you try to run it.  You need to replace the fs application file in your program files with the one named fs9 that is located in the ""No CD Crack"" folder from the original torrent download.  Once you have replaced that file, you should be able to run the program without any CDs. "

[T],stevekasian,2008-09-14T02:02Z,"Thanks to all the seeders who've perpetuated this download for the last 2 years :-)

For all who are having problems, please just read the damn readme file. It tells you all you need to know about installing/cracking the thing.

If you can't get to the readme file, please use your brain... think... Google is your friend, right?? So go to Google.com and type in 'ISO FILES'. THe first result will probably be a wikipedia page which will tell you all about the filetype and how to work with it.

Remember people: GOOGLE IS YOUR FRIEND! (except when they're harvesting personal usage information from you without your consent! lol)

Not going to explain here, so try reading the manual for your Torrent Client.

Good luck."
,[Schotty],2008-10-14T18:30Z,"stevekasian i'd just like to say sorry for uploading your exact same torrent, i thought i'd got it from somewhere else and didnt use the search button before uploading :) yours has more seeders anyway :P"
,HarleyThePirate,2008-10-15T01:47Z,"Nice, relatively fast (depends), clean download, thanks.! I'll see how it goes.

Well, what can I say, the amount of idiotic noobs on this site makes me smile big time; okay, I was a noob too, but I remember myself- the first time I downloaded a torrent I was also like ""wow wow what am I gonna do with this mess"", but I didn't even ask anyone and read what was said there and it was dead easy, the only problem once was that I didn't copy the crack but just moved so then I was like wtf because it didn't work and had to ask somebody :D but that was no big deal! So, hear what I'm saying. Just use your brain :S
1. Download WinRar from their official page.
2. Unrar it and run ""Setup""
3. Once done, don't start the game but go back your unrar'd folder, copy the crack file and open the folder you installed your Sim in and past it there replacing the ""real"" file- just press Yes when it asks to replace.

That's it! LOL"
,HarleyThePirate,2008-10-15T02:50Z,"Wow, the 2004 is the winner, it's just like between FSX and 2002, but looks much nicer than either one, if FSX ran pretty nice on my pc, this goes as smooth as baby's skin :D"
[T],stevekasian,2008-10-15T03:46Z,"Yeah, MS really sucked a big green donkey dick on FSX. It's like all cartoonie looking - totally unrealistic. Everything looks ""smoother"", but actually less realistic. They should've stuck with the same scenery rendering engine and just made it more efficient... able to utilize 2 processor cores, faster and bigger video cards, etc... improved the cloud texture transparency filters a bit, lighting effects, etc. Instead they screwed every FS2004 user who'd for years been waiting in anxious anticipation for the next level of improvement to their beloved kick-ass flightsim. Released a completely incompatible cartoon-like ""game"" instead of ""the next level"" graduation of the best flight simulator ever made, FS2004.

Bill Gates should be hung. Litterally. I say kill the bastard and throw is worthless body into the ocean for the sharks to feast on. lol. I'm actually serious too. What a motherfucker - he's single handedly caused so much frustration and pain in the lives of litterally billions of people the world over with his stupid, money-grubbing greedy attitude and outlook on business. What a shister."
,HarleyThePirate,2008-10-15T19:10Z,"Yeah, well, FSX is not bad, but it's indeed a bit like some cartoon and also, maybe it's just me but I think FSX is for real more like just a game rather than a serious simulator software that is 2002, 2004. I get kick out of navigating rather than being a big Boeing wannabe, you know what I mean. Therefore those cartoony graphics as you said is nothing I wanna see right now. So yes, I agree.

Also agreed on Microbilly Softgates.... Microshit is not about customers and clients :( These sims are the only software I really admire by them."
,HarleyThePirate,2008-10-16T00:18Z,"Hey btw.... I have one problem maybe anyone knows... this game likes to crash randomly. it's a long story over here in my chair lol but i've tried loads of things. my hardware, drivers are all alright it seems, otherwise it all goes smoothly. just a thought- could that be caused by 3d clouds?? cause after it crashes and i come back- in the setting 3d clouds setting has been set back to normal clouds automatically...and i tried it with normal clouds and it seemed pretty okay that far, but i don't know... just a thought! 2002 goes without a prob....but...also FSX didn't have this prob! what could this be?"
,HarleyThePirate,2008-10-16T19:17Z,"yeah, ran FS 2004 for a pretty long time today with 3D clouds (""detailed clouds"") disabled and it was going without a prob! but i have no idea why it is so because FSX which is all 3D based went alright just as well. Is it some software bug? Any updates to get shot of it?"

This torrent works 200%, no viruses! 

To all those noobs who can't do it,
get Daemon Tools (GOOGLE IT)
Then, right click on the icon on your taskbar when it's installed.
Hover your mouse over Virtual CD/DVD-ROM
Then, click mount image and select the FS2004.iso from this torrent.
Then, it'll install.
When it's done, it'll say you need to insert Disk 4 for it to work.
To patch this, right click on the Daemon Tools icon, hover over Virtual CD/DVD-ROM and then you should see Device 0 : MS FS2004.
Click on it, select this torrent's ISO again, and then when the image has been mounted, click on Show Files in Folder.
You should see a folder called Crack.
Copy the fs9.exe into C:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\Flight Simulator 9\
Overwrite it, and voila, it works."

[T],stevekasian,2010-01-06T13:24Z,"guitargamery: Thanks for the props man - Much appreciated!

Yes, I am back once again to slap down the mudrunts hopping around here with arms flailing, crying about this and that.

TO ANYONE HAVING ANY PROBLEMS AT ALL WITH INSTALLING THIS GAME:

For cripe's sake man, READ THE GODDAMN INSTRUCTIONS INCLUDED IN THE TORRENT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  It's all there, you stupid, no reading, leaching off others for help instead of doing something for yourself motherfuckers!! NO MORE HELP FOR LAZY STUPIDASSES WHO REFUSE TO USE THEIR BRAIN AND FUCKING READ!!

As for the other complaints here about download speed, being stuck at 97% with no seeders, etc.:  This torrent has consistently had over 150 seeders on it AT ALL TIMES for the past 3 fucking YEARS. The only reason you are getting slow download speeds/showing no seeders/etc is because you haven't configured your torrent client and/or internet connection/firewall properly. If you have it properly configured, this torrent will ALWAYS - Yes, ALWAYS - give you download speeds on the order of 250kb/s to 1.3mb/s, slower only if you have a crappy account with your ISP. So any complaints posted here about such problems will be laughed at and/or ignored by all who know better.

Thanks to all who've given thanks, and to all the peeps who've kept this torrent alive for the past 3+ years by seeding after downloading!! You all rock! I am really glad so many people are able to get a hold of this 1-of-a-kind app.

Oh, and fuck you to ""The Boss"" - fucking dolt! I'm coming 4 u, u little poser wannabe/wishuwerea hacker. lolol"

What is your opinion on important aspects of this game? Graphics, Flight Dynamics, Realism, Accuracy? I understand that your (probably) not a real pilot and can't answer for sure but I just wanted to know what you think. I already have FSX but I heard this one doesn't leave a fat ass footprint like FSX does. Is it worth it to get this or what? Thanks..."

,eldiablo82,2010-05-09T21:49Z,"CRACK INSTRUCTIONS:

IN ORDER TO KEEP THE F'N APP FROM ASKING YOU TO INSERT CD4, ETC., YOU MUST APPLY THE CRACK.

Once you mount the ISO image to a virtual drive/burn the ISO image to a CD/DVD/whatever, you need view the directory tree of the image with Windows Explorer/whathaveyou and look for the folder entitled ""CRACK"". Look inside the folder and you will see a .txt file. You must open this .txt file with Notepad or other text viewer and read it very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very CAREFULLY.

If after following the above instructions you still don't get it, please just go away and never come back to TPB - EVAR! Thank you.

,daddyjerz,2010-06-14T08:01Z,"Alright I'm gonna do the noob thing here and say: I'm guessing you have to already have some form of flight simulator 2004 on already installed on your computer before this crack will do anything?  Also I have already read the crack read me and the only think it says is copy fs9.exe to the install directory. My question is, where is the install directory? I am not a complete noob as I just installed the crack version of Left for dead 2 as well as NBA Live 10, and worked perfectly. This is the only that doesn't make since. Here is the read me text so you know I have read what I am supposed to:


This is a No-CD crack. This is the only crack needed.

Crack Instructionz:  Copy crack ""fs9.exe"" into install directory (x:/Program Files/Microsoft Games/Flight Simulator 9/) and overwrite original.

Then:

1. Find all your freeware add-ons at http://avsim.net/ and http://www.flightsim.com/ .

2. Find all your favourite payware addonz at The World's Largest Bittorrent Tracker.

3. Spend days and weeks reading about how the sim works and how to install your add-ons, so you don't have to post stupid questions over and over and over and over and bother the shizzz out of people @ TPB!

4. Realize that FS2004 & FS9 are the same damn thing.

5. Play the game and like it!

,barwili,2011-06-30T05:12Z,"for those STILL struggling get a grasp on the crack thing or who can't seem to locate Disc 4, here's what you need to do...

Once you've downloaded/extracted/installed, the program asks for Disc 4 when you try to run it. You need the crack for this. You're going to go to Amazon.com and run a search for Flight Simulator 2004. Once you have found that, you will need click the ""Add to Cart"" button, then look for a link that says ""Checkout"". You will be asked for some personal info (required for this method to work), but in a few days you should receive a package. You are going to need to open and extract the contents of that package. You're also going to need to burn the first three discs in order to install them. You can do this with a match or lighter, but I personally recommend putting them in your microwave for about 30 seconds. You will then get the crack you need using the 4th disc. Take out a cocaine rock (or go purchase one from your local pharmacist), and set it on Disc 4. Use a razor or sharp edged plastic card to break the rock up and form the powder into a line. Snort this line into your nose and you will have successfully used the crack. In order to actually simulate flying, you are then going to need to find the tallest building nearby and climb to the type. Get a running start, spread your arms wide to create lift, and leap from the building. If this quick little how-to guide doesn't solve your problems, then I'm sorry, but you're royally fucked. Happy flying!"

,GAZZA7745,2011-09-08T17:21Z,"For all NOOBS!!!!!!

I installed this easy without any CD's. So in the simplest understandable noob term possible, I will put directions in order.

1. Make sure you have Power Iso installed on your PC/Laptop.
2. Download this torrent.
3. Create a new folder on your Desktop (call it what you want).
3. Open the Iso file.
4. Right click on 'setup.exe', then left click on 'Extract'.
5. Click 'Extract All Files'.
6. Browse and select the new folder you have created on your desktop (this will extract all files/folders to there, and will take a few minutes.
7. Once done, open the folder on your desktop.
8. Double click on 'Setup.exe' (this will install the program, and will also take a few minutes.
9. Once installed it will give you options to Start etc.....DO NOT START. JUST CLOSE THE PROGRAM!!!!! (You will now have a desktop icon for the program).
10. Go to the original folder on your desktop again and double click on the crack folder inside that.
11. Right click on the Fs9 application and copy.
12. Click 'Start' then 'My Computer' ( or just computer if using Vista or above).
13. When that opens double click on C: drive.
14. Double Click 'Program Files'.
15. Look for the Microsoft Games folder and double click on it (there may be more than one game folder in there depending on if you already have other Microsoft games on your system).
16. Once you are in the right folder for this game, find a blank space on the right hand side of it and then do a 'Right Click' and then 'Paste'.
17. When asked 'Do you want to replace this file with one already there', just click on 'Copy and Replace'.
18. Go back to your desktop and start the game normally........Simples.

I could have obviously put all these steps in one or two sentences, but I know how difficult doing these things can be for NOOBS  :-)


PS...A big thanks to the uploader for this game. I was downloading at a steady rate of 2.2 MB/s, and it took about 10 minutes to download completely. I will seed for a bit.
