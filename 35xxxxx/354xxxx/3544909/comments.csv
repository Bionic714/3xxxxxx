[V],Fredrika2,2006-10-26T09:02Z,"Dear dae-su: I have everything by him, but only as standard stereo discs, no more in dts. Any particular album you'd wish?"
,dae-su,2006-10-27T19:15Z,"dearest fredrika, strangely enough, I do prefer normal stereo discs to DTS ones, as I can listen to them on mp3 players.
Any Jay Jay's disc would be nice, but more than any other else I was searching for Tattoo and Whiskey: it would be very kind of you to upload them... ;D and even the others, if you can... :) thanks a lot!! hi"
,t.e,2007-01-19T00:28Z,Can anyone please seed the last 16%?
,Tomten21,2007-02-04T02:21Z,"I guess this is an homemade DTS mix of the album. The sound was very bad. Just a little reverb was added to the sound, nothing else."
