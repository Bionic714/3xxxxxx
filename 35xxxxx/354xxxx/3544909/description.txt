Jay-Jay Johanson: RUSH (dts) Special Edition Album

1. Unrar using WinRar or similar software
2. Burn .nrg image using Nero (or compatible).

What you get is a music cd. You will need a dts decoder, either in your disc player or in your amplifier/receiver/surround processor, or else all you\'ll get is digital noise.

Since all tracks are interwoven (no pauses between tracks), some decoders, especially in older processors, sometimes miss the decoding start point at track starts. This is not a fault with the disc itself.

Technical: 5.0-channel dts surround sound. Music hifi playback equipment assumed (music center speaker, no subwoofer). Center channel -3dB (average), surround channels -6dB (average).

This reprise upload was inspired by Rosa Mannen\'s upload of Jay-Jay Johanson\'s latest video single \"She doesn\'t live here anymore\". Please visit www.thepiratebay.org
