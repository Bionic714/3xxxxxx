,Son Of Mogh,2006-10-25T19:53Z,"Thnx man, I didn't care about the others either. It is such a shame, when people could use their bandwidths for the better stuff, to keep seeding the lame shit."

,Roy Keane,2006-10-26T13:41Z,whats the problem? not that I like foxy browns language but its all explained with his comments. He has ripped the languages and the other shit that noone is interested in so this is the best copy out! so download download and enjoy!
,Daniel_ak,2006-10-26T15:18Z,"Holy shittt !!!! This i a great Qality. The REAL STUFF !!!!

lOVE YOUUU....    "
,funeral,2006-10-26T19:07Z,This the real Retail but has previews so it has been super compressed. Lots of artifacts. (blocks) Too Bad. But thanks for the Upload.
,Roy Keane,2006-10-26T20:40Z,"ok sorry, was wrong, same shit as the others but i can´t understand why foxy brown1?
do u think this is fun? u can´t even see the faces of people downloading your shitposts.
go to hell"
,biffen74,2006-10-26T21:06Z,"Are there only kids on piratebay?????
Most of the comments here are only crap-comments, and stupid.

Knaster and foxybrown: GROW UP, and write comments related to the movie/upload instead"
,biffen74,2006-10-26T21:08Z,"Come on and seed! I only get 40-50 kbit, it will take more than a day to download...."
,S3ZAi,2006-10-27T01:06Z,"Yeah, this is the real shit: all audio is still there, previews, commentary. For my part, somebody, take the original dvd and rip only the movie itself, get rid of EVERYTHING ELSE, including menus, etc. Just leave the subs, as those are just a few mb's. When I say everything, I also mean remove all the audio except the main english 5.1. This shit sux big time. It's a shame of all the bandwidth and I'm deleting even without seeing it. Damn it big time. I'm furious and gonna have some beer now to calm down. It's a good thing you're not around foxy, you would get the real thing right in your face!"
,WHAT?!,2006-10-27T01:27Z,Great Copy Thx Foxy! ;)
,DocHOL,2006-10-27T11:52Z,Looks like he just took the already compressed version and reencoded it without the extras. It doesn't bring back the information lost in the original rip. So still block hell.
,jomos352,2006-10-27T17:11Z,"this is not a very high quality version, with video birate at about 1.8 to 2.4 per second, but thanks anyway."
,drifter7508,2006-10-27T17:22Z,Don't download this crap!!! Same as the others- but even worse!! =P
,Inari,2006-10-27T22:15Z,NÅN MÅSTE HJÄLPA MIG!!!!!!! ingen som har har Simpor och grodfötter. skulle bli väldigt tacksam om ni kunde dela med er:).
,enyaw,2006-10-28T04:50Z,"Has the 5-8secs glitch around 52 mins of the movie and may cause the video and the audio go out-of-synch.
Appreciate for the upload, but just informing the problem"
,TurboTape13,2006-10-28T14:13Z,"If you are a REAL movie buff like me, do NOT download this. foxybrown1 is simply a copycat, it's like the others with extras, previews and all languages. Unwatchable on a big screen!"
,Mamba4ever,2006-10-31T00:03Z,SHIT QUALITY!  DON'T WASTE YOUR BANDWITH!
,xxBerserkxx,2006-10-31T11:58Z,YUP.. bad QUALITY if YOU ARE GOING TO WATCH THIS MOVIE ON A BIGGER SCREEN THAN Laptop dont waste time on this
,tokskew,2006-10-31T18:55Z,were can i get swesubs ?

,Der Steppenwolf,2006-11-02T12:23Z,Foxybrown1: You can suck my dick and please tell that fat bitch you call mom that i will leave something for her too.
,gary_currington,2006-11-24T02:04Z,anybody who wants quality and faster downloads try using newzbin and astraweb.you need quick par and win rar aswell to fully use the system.
,tomten7,2006-12-06T20:21Z,"Der Steppenwolf  det var jävligt moget skrivet, han gör vell så gott han kan. men i allafall hur är denna? Der Steppenwolf jag lyssnar inte på dej :D"
