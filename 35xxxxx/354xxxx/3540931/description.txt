BBC Documentary - Suez

Episode 1: Betrayal

The Suez Crisis of 1956 has become an almost mythical moment, the tipping point of Britain's imperial decline. What this terrific documentary does is chart, step by step, how the crisis unfolded and played out, using revealing contributions from officials and observers at the time and a few perfectly judged reconstructions. (James Fox plays Anthony Eden, a role you feel he could have been born for.) So much of what happened seems now, as one contributor observes, to echo a Shakespearean tragedy - great men brought low by tragic flaws: in Eden's case, his desire to show he could be tough with dictators. But there are great comic details, too, such as Omar Sharif recalling how the Egyptian king used to cheat at poker. All in all, it's a finely crafted, unmissable slice of TV history.
