,d-tritus,2006-10-30T13:21Z,"Hey, madkupe: Is it true that ""volk"" also means ""sheep"" in Slovenian?"
,mukusaki,2006-11-01T09:43Z,"
heh, no ""volk"" actually means ""wolf"" :)

thanks a lot for the torrent"
,Rickslick,2006-12-15T20:57Z,Tack tack =)
,Racman007,2006-12-15T23:02Z,"Madkupe, sej bi se verjetno najdlo ?e kaj poslu?ljivega tudi iz Slo.

Madkupe, we could probably find some more decent music even in Slo."
,Carantanian_Knight,2007-06-27T15:43Z,I agree with madkupe. Laibach is the best Slovenian band. I'm proud of them. Everything else is pretty much childish. Slovenians simply don't know what's good music. 7 bands out of 10 are Turbo Folkers... Too much... >:/
,freshearth,2007-07-15T15:14Z,Very interesting one from Laibach. Thanks for the upload! 
,fejesistvan,2011-09-22T19:53Z,"if you allow me... Laibach is uniqe, not only in Slovenia, but also in the whole region. Hungary, Croatia, Italy... damnit, half of Europe do not knows what the hell music is... Keep Up!"
