,dlklaas,2006-10-30T16:32Z,"Ofcourse, looking in the torrent is a way to see what files you are going to download.
But it would be much nicer if this information was visable in the information in uTorrent.
But still thanks you for sharing!!"
,uggenabben,2006-10-30T20:03Z,I am quite sure most of the retards around here are unaware about the fact that the information is available by clicking the number of files (at the top of this page). Try it!!!
,vankis,2006-10-31T04:31Z,Sure it's nice that people wanna share and all but sometimes it would be better if they didn't.
,31u/commo,2006-11-02T10:16Z,casb1 thank you
