,kegir,2006-12-03T21:38Z,"Try this http://www.k-litemegacodecpack.com/. Get the standard pac and play it in media player classic. 
it is dual audio so you can choose between French 
and Italian audio."
,yazigian,2006-12-14T19:38Z,"thank you very much for the help, kegir! :-)"
,codmat,2008-01-19T21:33Z,"Thanks kegir for re-doing the torrent.
I have the previous one and the English subs are in a sort of pidgeon English format that just can't be understood."
,codmat,2008-01-19T21:36Z,PS. Nice to see the torrent still going after 15 months. Nice one peeps.
,zeinabqureshi,2008-03-04T07:15Z,"Compared to other Bresson works, this one is deceptively simple. There is the characteristic attention to detail, and, it must be said, the characters are not 'buffoons' (Bresson's own description) like the Dreyer version (which is superb in its own right). These two are the best films on Joan I've seen so far.
The rip is excellent (the movie is small, though). Thank you very much, *kegir*!"
