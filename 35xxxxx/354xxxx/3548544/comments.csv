req xclass cloud 9

Flight 1 c172 1.4"
,rossirep,2006-10-30T22:22Z,"LOL -  im using FSX now, i actually quite like it.....

Only downside,  with my age'ing 2gig athlon, 1 gig ram, and 256mb graphics card, i cant get the best out of it... graphics set to low or FPS are destroyed!! lol


"
,belga1,2006-10-31T06:55Z,"I let FSX...on the shelves for few year....Will return in the stores when it will be at 10$
Actually if you have...
The most powerfull CPU...
The most powerfull graphic card
At least 2GB of speedy memory
The best MOB for put all this....
Applied all the tweaks already availables...
You will have a nice 10 FPS....with all maxed....
All maxed is the way FSX must running.....
If you reduce this and that...you will have a FS9 like but with 15 FPS....so what the heck..ROFL."
,rossirep,2006-10-31T08:53Z,"LOL  so what your saying Belga1, is.....  FSX doesnt work well with anything other than a super computer!! "
,Panodilo,2006-10-31T13:03Z,"Agree with last poster. I'm sticking with FS9. But on the same token I must stress that if I was to be given a new computer that could run FSX with at lest half-ass performance, then I would have no compunctions about giving my mother to a Vietnamese brothel where she'll be fucked mercilessly and fed roasted beetles."
,wye,2006-10-31T13:35Z,"Thank you

Question: does anybody know where you can get effects such as water spray effects on takeoff etc, ive seen it in some pics for fs9 but never come across any looking hard for some, if anybody knows please let me know, thank you."
,belga1,2006-10-31T14:42Z,"Water effects (splashes etc...) are availables as freeware at Avsim or Flightsim....
Just make a search in their addon's libraries."
,belga1,2006-10-31T14:49Z,"For spray effect etc....
Try this download from Avsim

,MrJalla,2006-10-31T15:03Z,"about FSX relax a bit, of course there are no FMC:s in it, there are none in the FS9 standard edition either btw. 

Performance IS a nightmare and untweeked FS9 does look better with superior frame rates (unless you turn off autogen traffic and other cool stuff), but give it a little time for the software devs to catch up to all the new stuff and release of DX10 witch is supposed to make it look better and run smoother and I'm pretty confidant we'll all be using it by the first half of the new year...

It's always the same thing with every new release and for those of us that have been around since fs4 it's getting a bit old...

,BlackBug,2006-10-31T15:28Z,"Well, it seems Microsoft have tried to catch up with X-Plane Simulator [which incidentally obtained FAA approval for CPL, IR and ATPL training]. But in the process 'The Law of Averages' has finally caught up with them. I, sadly, dont have the hardware for me to run FSX and comment on its resource-hungriness. But I have come up with many more negative comments from simmers about FSX, than positiev ones. So it is FS2004 for me for quite some time to come. And in the process I request if anybody could share ""FSGenesis - Eastern Hemisphere - Southeast 153m Terrain"". Thanx a lot. hxxp://www.fsgenesis.com/Merchant2/merchant.mvc?Screen=PROD&Product_Code=153DEM-ESE&Category_Code="
,blankbox,2006-10-31T15:48Z,FS9 ran its course....no more money to be made...consequently FSX....whether its ready for the big-time or not GOD (microsoft) said RELEASE THE SUCKER consequently .....WYSIWYG
,blankbox,2006-10-31T16:01Z,ohh...forgot to mention...all those outfits in SIMMARKET ....FROM ....AERIALFOUNDRY to ZINERTECH TECH are running around with hard-ons cause the spending spree is starting again...(which should make Panodilo's day!!!! :)
,wye,2006-10-31T16:05Z,thanks belga1 for the link
,belga1,2006-10-31T16:06Z,ROFL
,belga1,2006-10-31T16:08Z,No probs...ROFL was for Blabbox....of course :)
,BA331,2006-10-31T20:16Z,"does anyone know why, when I select the Flight 1 727 my FS9 does a CTD???

But anyways thx for this ross"
,rossirep,2006-10-31T21:44Z,"LOL some fantastic comments ^^^

Panodilo always cracks me up....

One thing i will say is,  i can muster around 20 fps in FSX with scenery on low,  However i can get auto gen up to normal and still keep the frame rate, so forests and stuff look really nice...

Some times with fs9 i can only expect 18 - 22 fps... so even on a 2 gig machine its possible to enjoy the game to a certain degree....*checks ebay for a dual core base unit.... lol* 

@BA331  Im not sure m8,  anyone else had problems please let me know. I have a disk image (.mdf) so can up that if needs be...  just its around 700mb...  i was trying to save space with the smaller setup file ;oS

,Panodilo,2006-11-01T12:00Z,Has anybody noticed the latest offering at Simmarket? A japanese photoreal scenery package. It looks like it was created with the latest blur generators. Just awful. But the hood ornament stealing gypsy in me wants it just the same.

,rossirep,2006-11-01T20:15Z,"Lmao, 

Could do with one to highlight all the whore houses in the UK...  my UK vfr scenery is lacking this option sadly... "
,blankbox,2006-11-01T20:50Z,Aiiiiiyoooo....didn't know the UK had honey-pots...tell us more...!!
,rossirep,2006-11-01T23:27Z,"Well there all pretty seedy and well illegal by UK standards - but most towns have a good few ""massage parlours"" to choose from..........................

,rossirep,2007-08-14T20:07Z,thank the lord for my old torrents!  46gig of FS2004 stuff lost on my old HDD really hurts ya know! lol
,yankees13_2,2008-03-10T21:09Z,The cracker isn't working. How do I use the cracker exactly? I don't know if something is wrong with it or me.
,fs2004rockz,2008-09-07T01:43Z,im using fsx   well the case   as a mousepad cause i get crappy framerates on it and if i have fsx and 2004 installed at the same time fsx disables 2004 and wont let me play it  i mean WTF microsoft bastards wont let me play both on the same computer then fine im just gonna keep playing fs2004 then. heck fs2004 with both freeware and payware addons on my computer is well over 30gb in size. the downside is my framerates suffer somewhat  and have dipped into the fsx range a few times lol.anyway thanks for the torrent im still downloading it at a whle 0.6 to 0.8 kb/s    so it should only take me a year to download it. idk why i even got highspeed internet if a download is gonna take 5 weeks to complete. oh well mabey after 3am CST the speed will increase.
,fs2004rockz,2008-09-07T22:40Z,as soon as i get this 100% downloaded im gonna seed it for 3 days or more   im at 83.9% right now  but nobody is seeding. idk mabey its slow cause im uploading that fs2004 4 disk iso with no cd crack.
,rossirep,2009-01-19T18:05Z,"sorry havent been able to seed this, I lost all my unbacked up FS data on a busted HDD. havent had the inclination to try collecting them all again yet. "
