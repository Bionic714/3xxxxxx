,e40,2006-11-05T22:23Z,"Ignore my comment above, please.  (For the reason, see this: http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3548409/Lost_Season_1_Episodes_1-25)"
,Dr_rectangle,2006-11-05T23:38Z,Yo it says there are 32 seeders and i am only downloading from 1/32 and its taking for ever...can more people seed please. thanks
,dust345,2006-11-06T02:18Z,"Assuming you are able to tell me, what does ""forever"" mean (expressed in weeks)? It took me about 1 week to download all this shit. Maybe you just relax :)"
,zeppers,2006-11-07T08:05Z,"Any chance someone who has a completed file (or a couple of you) could seed this again? It's showing at 0 of 0 seeders in Utorrent and the download dropped to .2k a second, 98% done so I'd really like to get this finished."
,dust345,2006-11-07T13:53Z,"Seems to be a problem on your side of the chain. If someone else experiences similar problems, please leave a comment."
,filthykid0123,2006-11-08T23:37Z,Im new to torrents and stuff. I downloaded this torrent but dont know what to do next. What do i do to download the episodes?
,dust345,2006-11-09T00:43Z,read this: http://thepiratebay.org/howdoidownload.php
,biereco,2006-12-08T14:22Z,Why do i get a black screen with audio when i'm playing the files. I tryed several programs (olso VLC media player) 
,dust345,2006-12-09T09:17Z,I don't know. Maybe your machine is too slow?
,drummerdude,2006-12-14T22:31Z,"Hey when i play the video the episodes it works fine for a bit, but then the video gets ahead of the audio and its anoying to watch...dose anyone get that problem and how can i fix it when i want to burn it on a DVD?"
,dust345,2006-12-18T18:44Z,"You converted them in another format, yes? Then just play around with the setting of whatever you use to convert them (making a dvd usually involves a conversion into mpegs)."
,Tamashaki,2007-01-12T09:08Z,Are the seeders limiting their upload speed? Cuz my download speed keeps below average all the time and i have no limits to it at all
,jester45,2007-07-06T03:28Z,it is normal for people to be under the average if their connection speed is under the average. or the peers connected are few but fast. or you dont have your client setup very good.
,chumzy,2007-07-31T16:20Z,seed again plz if you have it
