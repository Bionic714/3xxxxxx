Update for 1.40 and fixed exe to avoid activation.


After having some trouble with my purchased copy of GALCIV 2 playing it on 3 different location and since there is no fixed exe i decided to make it myself.

I\'m by no means an expert in this kind of things and i only tested it by reaching the menu screen i\'ve not yet made a game with this one, however i used the same code i used for 1.31 so it should work well 


This game *really* deserves your support.
I urge you to download this only if you play on multiple pc or the activation doesn\'t work for you, in any other case *buy your copy is well worth it* !

If this doesn\'t work for you i\'m sorry you can try to write here your problem and i may look into it.



You can re-distribute this as you like , however you should ALWAYS state that this game deserve to be purchased and this \'fix\' is only for people with no internet connection or some trouble with the activation.
