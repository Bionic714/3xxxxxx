,131369,2006-11-02T18:31Z,"Could you please seed the Geister Faust separately?
My connection is pretty slow...and I have the others on CD"
,topbudget,2007-01-04T23:43Z,"Would REALLY appreciate (and seed copiously) if someone would upload Black Earth with a lossless codec (flac, ape). On this torrent the album is unfortunately pretty damaged. Thanks for the upload however."
[V],awesomo,2007-01-21T02:47Z,are there still seeders on this? 
[V],awesomo,2007-01-21T03:00Z,"ahh, yes, i see there is! thanks! :)"

,ninjarobot,2008-08-08T03:12Z,"Thanx for this Torrent. Bohren and the Gore Club is deffo this years best discovery for me.
But... I downloaded it twice because of problems with distorted files mainly on Geisterfaust, then second time only to find it would happen again. Anyone else have problem with Geisterfaust?
Anyhooo thanx for seeding it.
Cheers!"
,AP2k,2008-11-05T07:29Z,"Yea, I'm having problems with Geisterfaust as well."
,cromagnonmonster,2008-11-22T00:20Z,The bass levels on this torrent are AWFUL.  What did you rip this with?  Were you holding a mic to the speakers?
,Chesan,2008-12-11T15:05Z,Awesome music. More speed please=)
,I.C.Wiener,2009-06-16T18:14Z,"Unfortunately the commenter two comments earlier is right. The peak is way too high to let the musik sound good. It is often slightly distorted and if the drum is a bit louder, there is a loud scratch sound. Really disturbing!"
,sethsethseth,2010-01-27T15:16Z,"According to (for example) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loudness_war, the distortion also can be a result of a bad source, not only a bad ripping (DA-converter and other issues).
You need not download ""corrupt"" files; open it in a wave editor und you may see wether it is heavily compressed or not."
,I.C.Wiener,2010-02-10T07:40Z,"Nope, Loudnes War does not sound like ramming a screwdriver into your head phones. This is not an exaggeration.
Listen to Black Earth' track 1 for example. As soon as the drums come in, it just sounds like something in your ear just broke.

There are songs that are alright, but most just do not play here cleanly. :("
