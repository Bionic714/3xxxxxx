If I understand this correct you can only run this if you have the original disk (to use in the PS2) to run games from the USB drive. or... you can use a copy of the CD but only if you have a modded PS2... If this is the case what use is this to any of us? I am quite sure you get this SW when you by the PS2 CD right?
