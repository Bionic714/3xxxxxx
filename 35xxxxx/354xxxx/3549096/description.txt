Here's three clips of Lacuna Coil at their visit in Gothenburg, Sweden the
29th of october 2006.

First they played an acoustic live set at CD-Specialisten, a music store.
I don't remember which all the tracks were though. My plans were to shoot the whole
set with my camera, but I fucked up so I only got "Within You" =/ better than
nothing I guess...

Great performance btw. Afterward it was time for signing records and stuff.
I got their latest album "Karmacode" signed and a promo poster.
Last the whole band gathered for a photoshoot where everyone could take photos.

When it was over and most fans left the store I took the opportunity to pose
and take pictures with the band members, hehe...but I don't include them here
for obvious reasons.

Later the same evening it was time for the concert at Trädgårn. Support were
Gothminister (awesome goth-industrial metal) and another band which name I
don't remember since they were cancelled.

The performance of Lacuna Coil were great anyway, lots of energy. Cristina
have a really good connection to the audience, so you can tell they appreciate
their fans!

when they were done they threw out a bunch of guitar picks, and drumsticks.
Unfortuneatly I didn't catch anything, I only got a unopened waterbottle from
Andrea, haha :P

Anyway, this is my story from this day. Now enjoy the clips!

Yeah, almost forgot...I used a Konica Minolta Dimage X60. The damn thing
records to huge Quicktime files, so the clips are converted to MP4 to
reduce size, even if quality suffers a little.
