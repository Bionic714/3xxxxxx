Vampiros en la Habana - Vampires in Havana

This hilarious spoof of horror and gangster movies, presented in an outrageously caricatured, bawdy style reminiscent of Fritz the Cat features Professor Von Dracula, a vampire scientist who leaves Transylvania for Cuba, who he invents to survive in sunlight. When the professor announces his intention to donate the "Vampisol" formula free of charge to vampires all over the world, the Vampires from Dusseldorf Germany try to muscle in and steal the formula. The action escalates and other monsters and our hero with his girlfriend are all caught up in the chase.
