From the box:
Two Swords of Aikido
with Shihan Mitsugi Saotome

Many samurai carried two swords, but few used both at once. According to the legend, the exception was the 17th century folk hero Miyamoto Musashi, who is believed to have developed a two-sword system for dueling.
On this video, Mitsugi Saotome Sensei - a direct student of Aikido\\\'s Founder, Morihei Ueshiba O-Sensei - demonstrates and explains his own two-sword system.
