,amoren,2006-10-16T14:03Z,"But what is that file:(
I just got it like that..
Hmm hope it`s not damaged??

My brother has a x-box BUT it got broken abou 2-3 weeks ago so i couldn`t check it..

How can i delete that file and update the torrent??"
,applematt,2006-10-16T14:23Z,Stoned Again?
,AcidReign,2006-10-16T16:56Z,"noob torrent, kinda pathetic. What a 'related' set of games. But what can you expect from someone that thinks PS2 is better than Xbox, although PS2 has 1/3 the hardware specs than Xbox, shitty resolution, virtually no componant or VGA video compatability. And the list goes on. Dude, don't create anymore torrents. Hell, if he's this bad, I don't even trust the games to even work. "
,amoren,2006-10-16T18:23Z,"Acidreign- the games work u moron, but im not sure about ""panzer elite"" if it works, if u really like the x-box why are u complaining??

I was just trying to make it easier for people and morons like u ""x-box fanatics"".."
,Grabes,2006-10-16T21:54Z,"in yours opinion fifa07 is must have game on xbox 
do you even know there is a game called pes5 is still tha king till pes6
by the way fuck this torrent there are more torrents with each game and more seeders so go away and play yours ps2"
,BalaMob,2006-10-17T11:06Z,"What ? 10 gigs ? Are you crazy ?
Are these games representing the xbox for you ?
Please ul torrents for your lovely Playstation... Oh, no, it's that right ? the Playstation 2 is out ? Waow ! THAT's something... ;-)

PS: Stop offensive talks, it's really obsolete when talking games ! :-D"
,amoren,2006-10-17T11:44Z,"What is wrong with people in here??
The ps2 is great, the x-box maybe has more spec`s but is ugly as hell and is in no way pretty enough to have in a livingroom (maybe a basement) or the garbagecan;)

But the x-box360 it`s another story, now the style has changed, but i still think that the ps3 will kíck 360`s ass---------->
If u dont want 10gb of games then don`t download the torrent u asshole.."
,Grabes,2006-10-17T12:48Z,Amoren if You choose console via its looks like so goodluck in future by the way if you live in garbagecan  i can understand why there is no place for Xbox Havent you claustrophobia?
,amoren,2006-10-17T12:53Z,"Ha Ha Ha really funny...
Did u think of that all by your self, im impressed;)
Keep it up like that ,then one day you will be a ""normal"" child...."
,Grabes,2006-10-17T23:32Z,anoying is yours groaning about xbox
,amoren,2006-10-18T09:46Z,"I know grabes, but i just don`t like the damn machine that`s build out of Bill Gates pockets ,the very same man who is the worlds richest and who is making more big money on the damn machine..

The man is so greedy that it get`s me so mad sometimes, he makes the perfekt scam like he gives away 0.001% of his fortune to the fighting aids program (that`s many money for os common people)and then some assholes think "":oh wow he is so kind giving ""so"" many money away to those poor needy people"".
And that i call is making M$ a BULSHIT....!! ahh hmm hmm sorry i have a flu, i meant making M$ a better brand on some false hope for the poor in the 3`rd world..
Screw him and m$.."
,Grabes,2006-10-18T10:31Z,i agree fuck him in tha ass 
,B-manSwe,2006-10-21T02:23Z,"Stop offensive talks, it's really obsolete when talking games, a machine is never better than its games, you can have a playstation 4 and still have bad games for it, then that machine sux...easy as that...and i agree with the others, if this is your idea of great games for the xbox you probably never played on an xbox...

I bet this is a lot of viruses"
,B-manSwe,2006-10-21T02:27Z,"amoren sux and dont have a clue what his talking about, end of story...
amoren listen to everyone here, ps2 is dead, a game on a ps2 versus the same game on an xbox is 2 different things...look at need for speed carbon for instance, jeeesus it looks like crap on ps2....easy as that, the people has spoken..."
,amoren,2006-10-21T04:09Z,"Nice going b-manswe u are truely a man of big words :s
And now don`t whrite anything as lame as "" that`s not the only thing that is big"" u asshole..

And no it does not contain any viruses for your information.. I bet u get called ""a special boy"" and with that i mean an IQ like toiletpaper;) Have a nice weekend-------->"
,caresso,2006-10-23T15:17Z,"wow u guys like talking shit.... anyhow I just download and burn it? no crack needed?

Has anyone been able to crack xbox 360 yet?"
,B-manSwe,2006-10-25T18:21Z,"amoren, you are just one of all those assholes that think you are invincible on the internet and picks fight with everyone, if only one of us other people here should meet you in a dark alley you would probably run hom to suck yuor mamas tit and cry, from no on noboby respects you a bit here and hopefully they want reply to your stupid insults or anything you write here at all, have a happy life little silly boy...//B"
,amoren,2006-10-25T18:47Z,"Why the hell should i meat anyone else from here??
Don`t u dare too meet me alone?
Or can`t u solve ur own probs??
Are u afraid that i would kick ur ass??

Fuckin bøg...."
,FunkyHonky,2006-10-27T18:15Z,"Well, my xbox has a custom dvd drive that plays all media, a 250gig hdd with 60 built in games and 20 built in movies, and my entire music collection, plus it connects to video streaming sites (including p0rn). so as far as im concerned, the playstation aint ruling shit dude."
,-Drakir-,2006-10-31T21:15Z,"As far as i concern its only one (or two) annoying things with the xbox, you cant capture video directly and you cant play Gran Turismo.
Yeah... (and three) you cant play HD clips either, otherwise its the ultimate HTPC-gaming-allyouneed-console...!!!"
,lolipop10,2006-11-04T08:45Z,"exuse me you speek swedish?

can you take just NBA07 to piratebay i just want the nba07 please :) i give ja 100 bucks if you do it :) "
,amoren,2006-11-16T03:34Z,"HAHAHA way too go ""jroc26""...

The ps3 is gonna be THA BOMB..
I read at some site, that every cell in the cell-cpu could be clocked up too 4.5-5.0ghz and that is really some imense powers the ps3 can do;)

And note that every cell (there is 8) runs at 3.2ghz allready..."
,steve248,2006-12-03T18:37Z,"Any one with any sense at all would realise that the XBox is an amazing machine and a million miles beyond the Playstation 2, this is entire attitude from the anti XBox idiots is entirely because of the ""Bill Gates and Microsoft are so greedy and rich!!!""

I have to ask, is Sony poor??? Do they give billions to charity? Do they make the Playstation because they are really nice people and have nothing better to do? "
,rogehr,2006-12-20T20:52Z,Didn´t get NBA 07 to work. Ftp the files with Qwix but the Xbox says its a damaged disc. Any suggestions? How do I get the Xbox to connect to video streaming sites (including p0rn) ?
