,rosehyman,2006-10-31T18:07Z,"To kolboshore and all others that do not understand that children in sweden and finland like to watch cartoons in their native language, grown ups do speak and understand english. 

But does your child, if you have any, understand english from birth or do they like swedish and finnish children learn in school???

weÂ´re not retards or atupid for wanting speach and subs in our language for the enjoyment of our children.


Is it so HARD to understand ???"
,gsa10132,2006-11-08T07:57Z,"ordf03 is norwegian, which means retarded by default.

Don't expect a non-adult to understand that seven-year-olds need to watch movies in their native language.

Fucking loser."
,gsa10132,2006-11-08T07:58Z,"kolboshore that is.. not ordf03, sorry."
,thedevilmyself,2008-04-04T02:05Z,I think it's obvious that Disney must hate Swedish and Finnish children.  That's why.
