,Mister White,2006-11-01T16:39Z,Quality (audio and video) is looking very good. I would say an 8 out of 10. It looks like a screener or something. It is definately not a TS or CAM.
,casso11,2006-11-04T00:35Z,Somebody forgot to mention it was a bloody 4:3 resolution!!! ... !!! Cant believe I wasted bandwidth on this .. This is so the last time I download something that has no description posted ...
,Mister White,2006-11-18T23:44Z,"Somebody also forgot to mention this is a worthless movie.

Can't believe the high IMDB rating. Its horrible."

,nerys,2006-12-07T04:05Z,"I hate wide screen. I do not have 3 grand for a widescreen television so I have NO USE for a wide screen film. I never complain though when someone puts the effort into giving me something with NO work on my part except to click and wait. I appreciate 4:3 or at least High enough vertical resolution 16:9 that I can crop and still have enough pixels left.

What I DO HATE is when people post 2.35:1 or whatever it is (ultra wide) and then use less than 300 pixels for the height. Grrrr but again I never complain about free. (but in case you read this if your gonna post crazy widescreen PLEASE use enough vertical pixels so all of us can enjoy it 400pixels or more please is enough.

16:9 is a good compromise I can ""stretch"" 16:9 to 4:3 with minimal distortion (can not do the same with the really wide stuff) and then if thoe $3,000 tv's ever enter the realm of reality I will be ready for them.

Till then I LOVE 4:3 :-)"

Mindless death by snake. What more could you want!!! (it is what it is a mindless kill fest and for THAT it was VERY entertaining :-)"
,jebrew,2006-12-09T03:33Z,"While casso11 was a bit harsh in his original posting, I agree that it would be nice to know things like source and aspect ratio.  I dislike 4:3 movies as well.  I won't complain because I appreciate the free stuff, but at the same time, I appreciate those that post specifics like this so I know what I'm getting."
