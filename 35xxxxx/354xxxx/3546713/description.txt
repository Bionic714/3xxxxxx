I once knew someone who would pay $50,000 for an Ultimate VII Construction Set. Considering it the best game ever made. In honor of the #1 fan of Lord British and the Avatar, I am seeding:

EA Top Ten Pack

Contains:

Kasparvo\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s Gambit (deodrant not included)
Grand Slam Bridge (no reference to wrestling)
PGA Tour Golf (what a waste of a good walk)
Seal Team (Ink not included)
Xenobots (Oil change required)
Chuck Yeager\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s Air Combat (Classics never die even when shot down)
Wing Commander II (No 1. gunner stuck on the tail)
Ultima VII: The Black Gate (History repeats itself vote for Dupre in next election)
Indianapolis 500 (before the floods)
The Lost Files of Sherlock Homes (Say what old chap?)
