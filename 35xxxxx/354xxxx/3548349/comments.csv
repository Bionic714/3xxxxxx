,Abstracta,2006-10-30T19:31Z,"Even though we should be happy for the movie, I agree that the quality should be better. All spoken languages, except english, should be removed, aswell as all extras. Subs don't take that much space, so they could be kept.

The most important thing is to have the best possible moviequality."
,borch,2006-10-31T15:59Z,"I rip it, so I decide the lenguages. If you want it in better quality, you can always download another version or buy it.

Joder, con los gilipollas que escriben por aquí. Habrá que pensarse en quitar este tracker del multitracker."
