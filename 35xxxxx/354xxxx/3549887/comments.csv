,lifebane38,2006-11-06T20:47Z,Is this a valid plugin /addon for wow?  Have not seen any plugins that were exe files before.  Or is this a zil that holds a readme and the addon within already compressed?
,StryderKC,2006-11-17T15:56Z,"This is an .EXE because the original distributing site made them that way.  It was done as such to prevent the morons from screwing up the installation.  

I'm ""allergic"" to .EXE files and game ""hacks"" so I extracted the files using WinRAR (you can probably use WinZip).  The .LUA files are intact and correct, a quick glance does not show any malicious code.  

This will stop working when Burning Crusade is released, Jan 16th I believe is the current date.  Have fun while you can."
