Synopsis
Yoichi Sai\'s prison film Doing Time stars Tsutomu Yamazaki as Hanawa, a man serving a sentence in a minimum-security prison. Life in the jail is rigid and organized, eventually leading all of Hanawa\'s cellmates to abandon their individuality. Hanawa lasts longer than the others, but a stint in solitary confinement leads him to the same emotional and psychological state as the others.

My thoughts: Hanawa, a gun crazy guy who ends up in jail for possessing illegal firearm. However the whole prison itself doesn\'t feel like one, but instead it\'s more like a military institution!
The film depicts the inmates sharing a dorm like cell and their daily life behind the bars and special occasion such as christmas and day offs.
A quirky and pleasant film, definitely worth seeing! After seeing the film you wouldn\'t want to end up in a japanese prison, hehe.
