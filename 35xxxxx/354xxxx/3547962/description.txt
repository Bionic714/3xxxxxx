Shannon Hoon has got to be one of the most talented singers of the 20th century. This dvd has live shows, all of their videos, including one for one of Blind Melon\\\'s greatest songs, \\\"change,\\\" and it includes clips of them from their every day life. This is a must have for any Blind Melon fan. They have a very vivacious, unique sound in their music which is hard to find these days, and the lyrics are incredible. Unfortunately Shannon Hoon is deceased, now, so there won\\\'t be any follow up albums.
