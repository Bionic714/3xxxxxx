Release Notes:

Third album from the New Jersey emo-punk titans, following 2004's 'Three
Cheers For Sweet Revenge', swaps the grand guignol concept of that album
for an even more ambitious one following the story's protagonist into
death and beyond. Produced by Rob Cavallo (Green Day's 'American
Idiot'), this marks an ambitious progression for the band and goes far
beyond the scope of mere "punk", encompassing the pomp and theatricality
of 70s pop and prog rock. Includes the single 'Welcome To The Black
Parade'.
