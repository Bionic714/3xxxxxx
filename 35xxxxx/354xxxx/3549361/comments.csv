,CanadaGuy28,2008-02-28T18:40Z,"I am Canadian, and this may be offensive, but it is part of our story as Canadians. No worst then any movies about 9/11 being made about the tragedy in the US. This is based on the true story, and we as the human race, need to see what people do, so we can all make the world a better place. If you think it is too offensive, don't watch it, I will watch this, as I saw all the news stories on this, and want to see how close the movie is to th actual events. Don't feel bad posting this because of that OTHER Canadians sheer lack of balls to watch this, and possibly learn something."
,CanadaGuy28,2008-02-28T18:41Z,"BTW, if someone could seed this, it would be great, as I only have 0.96 availability."

,Grismannen,2008-04-16T16:34Z,"Seeda snälla. Är fast på 99,6%."
,lexxy12,2008-05-27T04:24Z,"I was born just after the trial took place but i was born in the same town as Leslie Mahafy and she was a friend of my fathers, and my uncles, so growing up with the stories and then the retrial i of course want to know what really happened and i hope that this movie will give me an idea of what happened considering my father forbids me to watch it because the movie was made such a short time after this all happened. With the chain saw massicare movies they made the movies so long after the stuff happened that it didnt really bother anyone .. so for the people that do watch this movie just realize that this movie is based of something that is real and that  it did happen not to long ago and that Karla is a real women and she was let out of jail about two years ago and has a child and is with a man that was also just let out of jail, why the law let that happen is a whole other argument. Hope you understand why this movie should been taken seriously and seen as something more then a movie."
