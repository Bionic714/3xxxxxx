,greace,2006-10-22T03:32Z,"thegamer, so, how come no one can load no more than 2 or 3% per day. i see a load of people stuck on the same amount.

WHY BOTHER TO PUT SOMTHING THIS LARGE OUT IF YOU ARE UNABLE TO SEED IT.?

TOTAL MADNESS? 
 NO ONE SHOULD BOTHER WITH THIS. UNLESS YOU CAN WAIT A YEAR OR TWO."
,kjduncan,2006-10-22T14:50Z,".... This wont work.

I havent even tried to download it, and I know it wont work.

You need Steam to use these games, and without a legit copy... It wont work. Trust me, dont bother with this download. Buy HL2, it fecking rocks."

,ursak,2007-09-02T13:30Z,"Ur kiddin me right? First of, there's no problem at all to play steam games. There are a bunch of cracks out teher that works fine. U dont get to play over the net on most of em thought.

But more important! I bought my Halflife 2 over steam (stupid-ass-me) and uploads like this is my only way of getting the game on disc."
