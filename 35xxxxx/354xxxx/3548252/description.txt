BBC Radio 2006 - A Charles Paris Mystery - Sicken and So Die - podded by cheops
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bill Nighy returns as Charles Paris, actor-cum-amateur sleuth in four episodes of approx 30 minutes each of high quality MP3.

A full cast radio dramatisation of the 1997 novel by Simon Brett.

For actor Charles Paris, life is wonderful for a change: Frances, his wife, has let him back into her apartment (and bed), and he has landed the splendid role of Sir Toby Belch in Twelfth Night. Of course, none of this can last. At a publicity party, the director succumbs to abdominal cramps severe enough to hospitalize him. Enter Alexandru Radulescu, an avant-garde director who says Shakespeare "writes only about sex." As the provocative, spectacle-loving Radulescu slices and dices the comedy to shreds, Charles, who clings to a traditional interpretation, becomes increasingly resented by his colleagues, all of whom appear to be turning into Radulescu groupies. When, following a group dinner, another member of the company falls sufficiently ill to leave the show, Charles suspects foul play...

For followers of this series, this is classic Charles Paris, with the interminably struggling actor again giving us Brett's wry and entertaining view of the theater.
