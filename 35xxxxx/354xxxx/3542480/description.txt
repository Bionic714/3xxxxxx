I have finally fixed any audio encoding problems on my PC.
To prove it and to celebrate, I bring you this weeks show, the theme is GUNS.
The bitrate has been raised too so you are getting:
225K/bps VBR @ 44,000 in STEREO.
I hope you enjoy it. The shows will be of this newer higher quality level from now on!
