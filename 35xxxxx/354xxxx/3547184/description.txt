 Michael Flatley ?Feet of flames?

An expanded and more polished version of Lord of the Dance, Feet of Flames
was recorded at an outdoor performance in London's Hyde Park. While
much of the material is familiar to Flatley fans, the production is superior in
every way. It's better photographed and the editing is less frenetic.
The individual segments are sharper, more self-assured, as is Flatley,
who also produced and directed this version. (He also demonstrates his
talents as a flutist--maybe he should call himself Lord of the Renaissance.)
The outdoor setting also makes the show feel less like a Vegas act, though
the proceedings have about as much relation to their Celtic folk roots as
the Broadway musical Cats has to the T.S. Eliot children's poems on which it
was based
