The customizable security suite for policy-based access control ? for office and mobile workers

Today?s networked business environment and the rapid emergence of mobile computing make a company?s IT infrastructure a key ingredient for its success. However, the IT infrastructure has many potential weak spots: sensitive information stored on servers and personal devices demand around-the-clock protection, and system availability is a prerequisite for business continuity.

Therefore, unauthorized access to the IT infrastructure is a major concern. Security issues include prohibiting unauthorized access to devices, applications, and the company network; preventing users from installing unauthorized software and hardware; and blocking unauthorized Web access.

Organizations make serious efforts to establish company-wide security policies, but they often lack the tools to enforce them. SafeGuard Advanced Security fills this need.
