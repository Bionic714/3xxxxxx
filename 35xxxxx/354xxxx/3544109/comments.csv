,Roughy,2006-10-24T19:36Z,"yah well, the 2cd torrents are both death, and this was the only rip i could find >_> 

guessing the extra space on the cds were for cutscenes or something, as this one plays fine, with the voice acting and everything. "
,kasseey,2006-10-25T18:54Z,if u r intrested i can put both cd or just second one on torrent

There is no Install file on the CD. shall i run it directly from the ISO file? How to save the games if we can?"
