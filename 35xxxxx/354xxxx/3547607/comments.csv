,heroman1,2006-12-17T13:27Z,"CAN someone help me to instal it`?
i dont understand."
,Da King,2007-01-05T09:53Z,"Have you managed to install it yet? You have two options: burn an image onto a cd, or download a free program called www.deamontools.cc
this program will allow you to run images off your harddisk and makes a virtual cd drive for you. This 1. saves you the trouble of burning it onto a cd 2. is much faster than running it off a cd.

Let me know if you need any help."

,marflo,2011-01-05T03:49Z,"I advise everyone who wish to learn Spanish follow first Michel Thomas method and the continue wish Pinsleur 1-2-3 and plus lessons ans in half of year you will be able to speak with native Spanish speakers for example I been in Cuba this winter and I was able to speak and understand the Cuban people! Encarta from my perspective sucks, I tried to follow it but is too simple and you get bored soon.These ones you can copy on your cell and listen and repeat, I have much experience in learning method and indeed the repeating is the mother of the learning.I wish you luck-buena suerte!"
