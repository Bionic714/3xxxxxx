This is a very interactive and entertaining Spanish course. Speaking, listening, reading, writing. It has short movies in a story line. Once you sit down, you will easily spend a few hours learning Spanish. It\'s a shame this program was discontinued by Encarta, it would have been nice to see much more of it.
