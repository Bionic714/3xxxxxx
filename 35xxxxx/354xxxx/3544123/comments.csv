,brucebronze,2012-02-22T21:02Z,"for those who encounter this error message: Error 1603: Fatal Error During Installation

The following solution has resolved this error in the majority of cases:

 Make sure short file name creation is enabled on the target machine. You can check to ensure that the target machine does not have short file name creation disabled by navigating to the following registry entry:
 HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\FileSystem


 Make sure the value ""NtfsDisable8dot3NameCreation"" is equal to 0. This indicates that short file name creation is enabled. A value of 1 indicates that this functionality is disabled. You should change the value to 0.

After modifying this value, the target machine should be rebooted before attempting to launch the setup again.

enjoy the game

,BayWarden,2012-05-24T01:54Z,"erichsee14...and all others.Crack is in the download,just open folder called ""Deviance"" and BAMM! there it is..."
,BayWarden,2012-05-24T18:09Z,"Also,to all others new to torrent and cracked games,here how goes the installation process.

-Download this torrent
(optional)-Download Daemon Tools (any version) or Power ISO
(optional)-If you do not download above said programs,then you must ""burn"" this torrent file to the CD/DvD.
-Using Daemon Tools,right click on the system tray icon,then pick ""Add Virtual Devices"" press ""Add DT Virtual Drive"" when you go to My Computer next time there it will be another drive.In the Deamon Tools,after adding DT Virtual Drive mount image from the Far Cry folder (where you have downloaded it)
-In the Far Cry folder run Setup launcher
-After the installation process you need to ""crack"" the game.
-Go to the place where have you downloaded the torrent,search for the folder called ""Deviance"" there you will find two files:a manual and Far Cry  "
,BayWarden,2012-05-24T18:13Z,"right click on Far Cry file (leave that manual alone,maybe read it for a change...)click Copy.
-Now go to the place where you have installed the game,right click on empty space and press ""Paste""
-Double click on the shortcut,Far Cry file in the installed folder and have fun playing the game :)

If you ""burned"" the game then just insert the CD/DvD into the disk drive and skip the ""Deamon Tools"" option and ""how to"" part of it.

If you are using Power Iso,well protocol is pretty much the same as for Deamon Tools.

Thank you very much  PowerCheez and Deviance for uploading it,and Crytek and Ubisoft for making it!"

,malcumsquirt,2012-07-12T10:47Z,"I'm getting an extreme graphics glitch. If I attempt to max out the graphics, or even set it to medium detail, then everything looks like it's shrouded in a bluish fog. I can't see anything and it makes the game impossible to play. I have no choice but to play the game using the auto-detect settings, but that sucks because the game sets everything to low for some stupid reason. I have an Nvidia GeForce 210 1024MB, so I should be able to increase the settings on an eight year old game. "
,incoherence,2012-07-16T10:26Z,"Really great torrent if you're using Windows XP, but if you're not you're going to have to download the x32/64 bit patch for it. Which is a bit of the bitch, that is unless you're okay with not being able to see the ground."

,Seargant007,2012-08-14T07:25Z,"works great so far and i have a mediocre laptop running windows 7..heres what i did:

-mount the iso file using poweriso
- u can then double click to the cd to start install or open and view the files and click on setup.exe
-after install go the the 'deviance' folder on the cd and copy the farcry.exe
-go to local disk->program files->ubisoft->farcry and paste and overwrite it there
-if you only paste it there you might get the crysystem.dll error like i did at first
-to solve this also paste and overwrite it in the folder named 'bin32' 
-you must also start the game by double clicking the farcry.exe you pasted in the 'bin32' folder ( i found that using the other one gives the same crysystem.dll error)
-if you installed a desktop icon you should delete it (that would give you 'insert correct cd error'
-just right click on the farcry.exe in the 'bin32' folder and create a shortcut and place it on the desktop for easier access....
- and voila enjoy your game"
