Fucked up world, ain't it?"
,hera150,2006-11-03T09:16Z,"Women are in a much more unclear and hostile situation the second they grasped what was happening - whore stigma, being weaker physically, fear of being taken advantage of (a line set up by society has been crossed- this doesent exist the other way around - we are in full control), all this in the backbone of their self. Also; in 9 cases out of 10 it'd be a perv and rapeist psycho (something the women has in the back of her head that second that she wakes up) - there are no women pervs and it'd be something entirely different if it ever happened."

,thepsychoanalyst,2007-07-11T07:56Z,"hera, that's why you tell her to say ""stop"" two times so she feels safe and that you don't want her to feel like she's getting raped and then she'll be glad to be fucked... "
