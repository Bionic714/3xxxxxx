I hope you are patient with me and my PC troubles lately. I thought I had fixed the encoding problem on my PC by trying different software but alas...someone mailed me to say that, wherever they paused and tried to play the file anywhere in the middle or another place, when it was played again, it would always play from the same spot. somewhere during the track 01. I tested it and it\\\'s right. I think the MP3 has an issue about where it can be restarted from but all in all, the file plays fine from start to end. The problem only becomes apparent if you try to pause it or play it from a part other than the very start.
clear?
This is a whole new encode, same source, no seek problem. Or any other problem!

NEXT WEEK...NOVELTY: The first release will be perfect!

Note..I will leave the other torrent of this going for a couple of days and then...delete it!
