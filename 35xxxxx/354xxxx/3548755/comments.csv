found above as this is what it reads:-

This is a VHS rip. The movie has yet to be released on DVD. A friend of mine bought this DVD on e-bay and only realized it was a VHS rip after the fact. To prevent someone else from being had on e-bay, thinking they are buying an authentic DVD copy, I figured I'd seed the ripped copy. No reason to buy it on e-bay now. "
,xprosector,2006-11-01T16:55Z,"Cheech and Chong's Lovers!

""Born in East L.A""...  This is the only DVD nobody shared in torrent ever!!!
