I do computer graphics as a hobby, and I've been taking photos and turning them into abstract wallpapers.

These are all 1280X768, which means it's WIDESCREEN. I plan to edit them and make a separate torrent for 1024X768 wallpapers soon.

I'm making the images in sets, each set having roughly 3-5 images. The sets generally correspond to where I took the original photos, what the photos were of, and my general feeling towards to finished work.

This is my first set, called Intimacy. I'll be uploading 2 more sets straight after this so watch out for them.

Here are the thumbnails for the wallpapers:

Please feel free to do what you like with them. I don't mind you using them for commercial purposes. But I would appreciate you giving me (Athanatis) credit for these wallpapers for any non-personal use. It would also be great if you could tell me what you're using them for, and give me the website if there is one (this is more for personal pride really, so that I know people like my work).
