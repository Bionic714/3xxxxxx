,tgbrfvedcwsxqay,2007-09-30T21:18Z,"Hello!

I found that the file list does not contain the filename of the patch file that is included in rar format. However I could not extract it. There is no error message but the after the extraction procedure there is ko file created in the destination folder. Does anyone any idea? It is strange that the patch file is less  than 20KB..."

,fatalerror1952,2007-12-05T18:26Z,"Hi;
I loaded the program and exams. I then ran the patch program and received the following message, ""2 out of 2 patterns at least once. The patch should work ok. I then ran the program and clicked the start button on the right and it took me to the exam page options. But if I select any of the test option buttons or the Flash card button the program displays a message box that states that the engine has encountered a problem and to restart the program and then shuts down. I have downloaded the torrent twice with the same results. does anyone know what I can do to correct the problem. Thanks. ;=)"
