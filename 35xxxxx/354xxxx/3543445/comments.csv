,aksko.aksko,2008-04-09T05:36Z,"It works OK.
Double click the downloaded FreeHandMX-en.hqx file
and it will extract working installer.

Working S/N is WPD700-57309-77394-37406 as submitted by chaos33."
,threepointstar,2008-05-11T15:15Z,"IMPORTANT:

You will need Stuffit Expander to unzip this file.

You can find it here:

,xeikon,2008-07-22T01:00Z,"DO NOT USE the installer inside the ""FreeHandMX-en"" FOLDER. Decompress the FreeHandMX-en.hqx file with Stuffit Expander. After decompress use the installer from inside the new folder created from the FreeHandMX-en.hqx file."
,Kixxr,2008-09-18T13:30Z,"works just fine.

Indeed, this S/N is WPD700-57309-77394-37406 is correct.

,raul_fdz,2011-02-15T17:14Z,You need to select open with the 6.7 kB file and then you torrent downloader will begin downloading the actual file.
,pirateoftheheart,2011-04-20T00:04Z,"Hi, I have the same problem as Ast_ph and thopants:
Done installing. When ever trying to launch the APP, it quits once the icon in the dock started bouncing...
Could it be incompatible with Snow Leopard, despite the fact, that Rosetta is installed? Any clues?"
,pirateoftheheart,2011-04-25T17:40Z,"Hi, ast_ph and thopants: After invesigating on the net I found out that the problem in my case really had to do with Snow Leopard. Find the solution here:
