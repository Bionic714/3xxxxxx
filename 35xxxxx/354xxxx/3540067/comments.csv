I must give you a hell lot of credits and thanks, but I think the uploads you were doing were a bit too big...
4 different manga-packages with over 40 GB, thats too much to upload and download. But anyway, a good project and good quality on the mangas;)
Hope you release another project, but not that big...
I'll be sure to seed then, my comp got busted up and needed to send it to the repairs:(
But keep up the good work, and this time, I'll keep my comp health up and seeding good:D"
