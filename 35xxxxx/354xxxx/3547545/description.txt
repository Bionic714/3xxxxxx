Shot with the HD camera (this is DVD version tho), 1 hour 40 mins of nature paradise cruise on Iriomote Island and Taketomi Island (southwest of Okinawa) in the tropical part of Japan.

Iriomote Island is covered with tropical virgin forests grown with abundant rain and scorching sushine. There are beautiful scenaries of waterfalls, mountain streams, and rivers flowing from mountains, forests to the coral reefs and the ocean. This mysteriously beautiful nature is a lush paradise for wild animals and plants.

Taketomi Island has beautiful Kondoi Beach, roads covered with white sand, garden walls of piled coral limestones, and red-tile-roofed houses with Shisa lions that ward off evil.

You can indulge yourself with this ambient film with only comfortable natural sounds recorded simultaneously on the location!
