,guru_stpetebeach,2006-10-27T04:20Z,"This little culprit:
mp2dmx.ax

was causing explorer, winamp and media player to crash on loading of this show! If you get the same thing, find that file and rename it and possibly mp2data.ax, to mp2dmx.ax.old, etc., and everything should play fine.

FYI: For those interested this is a DirectX module installed by some program that is known to be buggy. By renaming it, DirectX searches for another audio splitter and under most people's installations will find another appropriate audio splitter that will work.

thanks for the show spiderman!"
