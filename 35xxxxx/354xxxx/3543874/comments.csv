No. This is a multi-language version. To switch to another language: open the file ""vxSettings.ini"" in an editor, search the section ""[Language]"", go to the line ""Default="" and replace the word after with one of these: ""English"", ""German"", ""French"" or ""Italian"". Then save back."

How do I patch it? I downloaded the 1.16 patch from the main website, but each time I launch it, it gives me an error that ""Celtic Kings is not installed"".

I'm pretty lost at this point.

Aside from that, game is working fine."
