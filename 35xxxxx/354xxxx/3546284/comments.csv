,Hypermagic2,2006-11-05T15:07Z,"Please seed, mine is stuck at 43.1%, if you're going to upload a torrent at least seed it until other people have 100% of it, thank you..."
,Hypermagic2,2006-11-07T22:25Z,Hey thanks for re-seeding this torrent! You are awesome!
,Hypermagic2,2006-11-08T18:50Z,"Again, I ask that u reseed this torrent, it is stuck at 49.2%, please seed it for another couple of weeks, thank you..."
,Hypermagic2,2006-11-09T02:46Z,Please seed!!!
,Consider-Phlebas,2006-11-09T23:13Z,"If (s)he does not seed it is likely for a reason, and probably it will not help to repeat the request. I think the seeder has a very low bandwidth and just seeds daytime some days of the week. 
Would have been nice to have had an announcement about that though, before committing to download several GB in a rate that's slower than anything I've seen so far...

Linguistic unimportant comment: I do not think that you can reseed something that has not yet been fully seeded to a 100% ;-)"
,Consider-Phlebas,2006-11-11T19:21Z,Now it is moving OK :-)
,Consider-Phlebas,2006-11-12T20:00Z,"Even good speed! Finished download and now seeding to fulfil my obligations...
Thanks for the upload!"
,elocius,2007-06-06T03:09Z,"hey thx for this torrent! I have a problem reading the files though, I get a codec error. I am trying to watch the episodes that have downloaded, because the torrent is not finished downloading, maybe that's the problem. But if you used some non-default codec, could you please tell me where I can get it? Thanks"
