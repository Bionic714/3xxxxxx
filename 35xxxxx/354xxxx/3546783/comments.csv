,0verl0rd_of_Mayhem,2006-10-28T11:36Z,Your welcome.  I just wish K2 would officially release this on torrent themselves as they would be able to make it faster initially.  Plus they could use in-game rewards system for people who seed consiberable amounts too.
,dont_like_j,2006-11-16T00:33Z,"K2 is too dumb to trace ppl that seeds large amout, cant even ban the active cheaters, nor have active gms on. This game is only good for the ppl that have been playing it for sometime and has gotten used to cheaters (barley) sad but true"
,dont_like_j,2006-11-16T00:35Z,"oh and if you happen to like the game remember this, whatever the site say that its F2P its actually P2P since it has a block system with allow only paying ppl log on if the server is 80% full"
,chriz00,2006-12-26T18:09Z,plz seed !! got 99.8 %
