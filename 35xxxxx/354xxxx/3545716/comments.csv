Strange thing is that although TPB shows there is one seeder Utorrent doesn't show any seeder, it used to be the other way around... but then again the torrent are ver fresh so... we'll see what happens...

Thanks again for sharing the DVD."

I ripped the video from the DVD you seeded so that others don't have to download a 4 GB file in order to watch the one hour video. It's at http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3545716/Guild.Wars.Nightfall.Making.Of.Bonus.DVD"
