Series III

Set in the south coast of England, Foyle\'s War stars Michael Kitchen (Reckless, Oliver Twist) as the no-nonsense Detective Chief Superintendent Christopher Foyle, who fights his own battles on the home front while war rages in Europe. In Series III, Foyle and his team get caught up in a row between rival spy organizations, and investigate a killing at a country manor housing a severe burns unit.

Foyle\'s irrepressible sidekick, Sam (Honeysuckle Weeks), begins a romance with Foyle\'s RAF pilot son Andrew, and goes undercover to investigate a murder at a farm. Then the detectives probe suspicious activity at a shipyard, the scene of an unexploded bomb. Once again, Foyle\'s loyalties are put to the test as his inquiries uncover truths that powerful people would rather keep hidden.
