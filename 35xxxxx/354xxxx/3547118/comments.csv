,xander4,2009-08-10T20:41Z,"More seeds would be greatly appreciated!! At the current rate, my download wont finish for another 6 days.

I'm downloading this torrent on my seedbox and uploading at 10x my download speed... so my share ratio is staying steady around 1,000%"
,c3k1,2009-08-17T11:41Z,"These are the same AVIs as the ones included in http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4210756/X-Files_Season_1-9.
Byte to byte match.
IMO the other ones were ""stolen"" from here."
,srbvamp74,2009-09-10T07:32Z,"Would someone please seed...stuck at 98.8%.  Link died all of a sudden today...was going along just fine...tried reloading link and stopping and starting Utorrent again, but nothing...would much appreciate it.  Thanks"

Much obliged, VELHINHOCEGO."

,piratiinho,2011-07-30T00:10Z,"Same old problem: IT IS TOO SLOW !

Thanks anyway to the uploader, the quality is good and this TV show rocks !"
,piratiinho,2011-07-30T00:53Z,What I do by the way (I may not be alone) is to download episode by episode.
,runa99,2011-12-26T06:48Z,"Took me 5 days to complete the full series + 2 movies thank u so much uploader.
Decent speed except for seasons 2 and 7 which were quite slow. Gonna seed the whole thing for about a week"
