,AcidReign,2006-11-06T16:51Z,"The French sure do have a lot of shit talking, until they needs other countries (like the USA) to bail their non-bathing asses out of trouble. And to the idiot that said that Americans don't understand foreign films - we DO, but we have more money and better equipment, so we like to watch shit in better quality. Go stuff your face with Swede meatballs, loosen your suspenders, ang go make some chocolate or whatever the hell you do. 

And to who said 'French Power', -- WHAT POWER, the ENTIRE WORLD knows the French are pussies. That's like saying 'MIDGET POWER'. So again, WHAT power, other than your smell because you guys rarely bathe?"
,Loirinho,2006-11-09T22:12Z,And YOU should TALK AcidReign; those americans doing Europe without knowing SHITE thinking it is ONE country - but no WONDER with a shitty president like that... He really shows off the braincapacity of the american people...
