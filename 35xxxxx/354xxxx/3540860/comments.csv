,r4t,2006-10-18T06:33Z,"As i mention so many times, vodkaeye is one of the most known for sharing xbox games in TPB. I would never say anything awfull about him. Please be carefull on what you say, what i meant when is.... he's the only one that marks x on his description and never once i told him anything, what i said was all in fun.

anyways thanx again for this game and all others :)"
