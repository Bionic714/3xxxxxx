This is the Full version of C&C (version 1.0) Generals.

You\'ll need to use Toast or some other disc burning app to burn a hard copy of this to DVD, otherwise using Toast or Disk Image Mounter won\'t work. Otherwise, this works 100%. No serial required. Thanks to the good ol\' folks at Pantip Plaza for this. 

Now does anyone have the C&C ZERO HOUR expansion?
