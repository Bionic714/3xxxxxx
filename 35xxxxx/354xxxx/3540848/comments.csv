,theanimaster,2006-10-17T11:08Z,Damn. I accidentally clicked on 1 star for the quality rating.  Oh well.. tell me how well my machine seeds. This is the first torrent I've ever made. Ever. Really. Hope it works. 
,theanimaster,2006-10-17T12:24Z,"ARGH. I hate my ISP! Fcuking morons don't know sh1t about sh1t. Dickheaded connection keeps dropping. I hope someone DLs this quick so everyone can have a more reliable seeder. 

My Timezone is GMT+7 EST Bangkok and my 'puter will be online from 9am-8pm for the next 2 weeks, otherwise It'll only be online from 6pm-11pm when school opens again. I dunno about the rest of you but at the place I'm staying at I don't pay for electricity and boarding so I've got to follow the rules on power conservation.

Once again. DAMN my ISP! Mo-fos."
,stonkerman,2006-10-17T13:25Z,Thanks for the up man! Is this universal? (ie will it work on an intel mac?)
,theanimaster,2006-10-18T08:59Z,"This came out before the Intel macs. I don't think it's UB, so it might just run on Rosetta."
,Stormreaver,2006-10-18T15:53Z,"Universal binary update is under development. It runs fine on my MacPro under rosetta, however some graphicbug makes the ground show in strange colors(under rosetta)."

,tobbe_920,2006-11-24T20:20Z,"what is seed plz tell me at swedish
"
,theanimaster,2006-11-25T09:30Z,Sorry 'bout the being stuck at 30%. I had to re-seed this after something weird happened with Bitorrent (it stopped seeding... even though I'm th friggin main seeder). After that my connection just stuffed up and i've been with no internet access for almost a month (or about a month or so...) Now it seems to be seeding again... though I'm 'borrowing' the connection from someone else. I'll try re-seeding again from my workplace so I can get faster speeds :D.
,Marretin,2006-12-05T01:16Z,Seeding means kukslickare in swedish for you who dont know that
,parditty,2006-12-05T17:28Z,"im stuck on 53.6%, I had it downloading at 600KB's to begin with and now it's just sitting there :(
