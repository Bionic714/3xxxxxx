1) Just use KeepVid (web-based movie site downloader, it supports by far more sites than just google video and you tube) [http://www.keepvid.com/] and download the .flv (flash movie file format) to your HDD. 

2) Then, if you want to convert the file to another format (like avi, mpg, etc.) you can easily use a video converter of your choice to do so! In that regard, I highly recommend ""SUPER"" (freeware, extremely powerful, it has several built-in codecs so you don't need to download a bunch of codecs to be able to convert) [www.erightsoft.com/SUPER.html]

3) Finally, if you now want to build/burn it as a DVD, I higly recommend ""ConvertXToDVD"" (shareware, it has subtitle support and most things that you will ever need) [www.vso-software.fr/products/convert_x_to_dvd/]

Very simple and efficient! :)"
