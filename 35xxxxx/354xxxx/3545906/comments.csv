,tomloadus,2007-01-23T09:29Z,"all my sound seems to work except for episode 4, ive DL episode 4 from other torrent sites and it seems to be the same with those as well. anyone having this problem??? maybe if its just a file error SUPREMUS could re-upload this for his fellow torrent users here at piratebay. if you do this SUPREMUS let us know. thanks"

,LadyBlack,2007-01-31T12:15Z,does it work or is it shitty? It's just common sense and politeness to let people know dude!
,thunder1,2007-02-02T03:31Z,"I also have a problem with the sound. Nero showtime seys it needs a dolby plugin to play the audio. 

""Seed"" is probably all the english most of the users here know."
,Tha Bad Guy,2007-02-04T11:35Z,I want to d/l but can you guys confirm the sound works?
,garfunkle4life,2007-02-14T21:17Z,"Every time I try to play these files, they crash. I have downloaded the torrent twice, and I still have this problem. I have all the correct codecs, what seems to be the problem?"

,Carolinemf,2007-10-16T17:51Z,"Hey, can anyone help me out? My download worked just fine (200kb/s) untill 77,8 %. Then it just stopped. Is it because there is no seeders or what? I've experienced it before with some other torrents. Can anyone tell me why?"

I seed and never bitch about needing seeders.  could it be something with the transfer that got messed up or is a codec thing... need help thanks."
,xushi,2008-08-19T01:12Z,"What's with the file size ranging from 480MB to 670MB ?
