,Barkingspyder,2008-11-28T22:49Z,"If someone could upload the last episode of season 3  A Dog With 2 Bones part one, in a video format that is common enough that the average person is likely to have the codec for it, that would be just as good as the codec for these video's.

TIA

,SwedishMeatball,2011-10-17T17:48Z,"Farscape666: 
Thank you for the wonderful torrents. I have only watched the first episode and it is awesome. Keep doing single season torrents, it makes life much easier. However, might you be able to do a torrent of the extras for the entire series?

Downloaders:
My first few downloads, I was concerned about exceeding my data allocations or slowing the downloads by using uploading for the available bandwidth. I set the uploads to 1kb/sec max.

I found out that my provider wasn't going to slow down or stop my internet access and that it did not affect my downloading speeds. So, I opened the uploads up fully. 

The other side of this is that I have noticed a huge percentage of leechers. I am seeding everything that I have downloaded, until I reach at least 2/1 ratio. Please give back to the community! Give as much as you can, because it makes you a better person!

My uploads are set to unlimited, most of the time, on torrents I have completed.

The ones I am still downloading, I am throttling the upload back, if my download speed is less than my upload speed. So, if you are downloading this torrent, set the upload limits to 0 (zero) so they are unlimited! I will respond in kind!"
,kcg420,2012-07-02T04:51Z,"thanks for the upload

SEEDERS PLEASE fix your settings and seed to the max I see 40+ full copies and less than 10/k on your uploading and thanks again"
