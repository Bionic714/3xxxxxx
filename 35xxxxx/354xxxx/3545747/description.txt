DVD created from DivX version I found somewhere while ago. Techical quality is not too good, but that is something we just have to live with. This movie hasn\'t  been published on DVD and it seems that it probably never will be either. Here is you change to see one of the greatest films ever made :-) Original DivX probably ripped from some bootleg dvd.

I don\'t have great bandwith so be patient....Check the sample file first so you know the quality, before taking the big one... and yes it\'s my first, so be nice to me...
