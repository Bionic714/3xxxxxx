,givemefreeshit,2011-11-29T13:30Z,"Just asking: why, if the original is a not too great DivX, is this upload a 3.29 GiB file? 
Wouldn't it make more sense to upload the DivX in stead of an unnecessary bloated DVD file without the quality of it?
Not bashing you here, just wondering, as this will take forever to download and will take up more space than needed."
