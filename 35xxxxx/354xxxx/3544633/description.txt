Episode 63: Air Cylinder Rocket
Put simply, this episode is vintage, explosive MythBusters. Adam and Jamie have unfinished business from their Shark Week special, where they shot and then exploded a scuba tank. But they've always wondered if a ruptured cylinder ? carefully aimed ? can really cause the massive damage some people claim. Meanwhile, Tori, Grant and Kari go back in time to test some prototypes from the past. They all sound highly dangerous, and they probably are ... After all, they're tinkering with engines fueled by gunpowder!
