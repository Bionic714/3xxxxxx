,KaKistoZ,2006-11-13T05:31Z,"Hi KangaRoO. 

Have you tried playing this on LAN (offline, that is)?

I've already acquired a german/english version of the game. It works great actually, but the problem starts once you try to play on LAN.

It seems that you can only play 2 players at a time on one server. Whenever more players try to connect, it throws off one player, giving them the message that they were disconnected from the server because UT2k4 failed to check if the key was valid, or even sometimes, it says to us directly that the key is invalid. 

True enough, but however that seems strange because that usually means that we've installed with the same keys, but we made sure that we got ourselves different keys to play with.

We all updated to the latest version and used the latest crack available on GameCopyWorld. Could this be the problem?"
,KangaRoO,2006-11-20T18:10Z,"Hey KaKistoZ 
I played this game at a lan, Installed it at 20 Computers with diffeent Keys from the Key-Gen. One of us Eithet hosted the game as Listen, Or Play and Host. And it worked with No Problems at all.
Not Once anyone did get trown off. We where not on the internet or anything. We dident Update the game at all, JUst fresh install"
,KangaRoO,2006-11-20T18:18Z,"But also Try To Check the difrent settings inside the game regarding lan.. How many Players it are set for and so, Donno if that might Be your Problem'"
