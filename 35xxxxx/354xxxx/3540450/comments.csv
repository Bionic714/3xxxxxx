The laptop needed to be cleaned a few times, and just delete everything and install winxp again. So be careful when using this program."
,raisak,2006-10-18T03:06Z,"lol.. perhaps you should monitor youre brother DL`s ;)

Its not the program mate.. Its the user. All the spywere you find in there you altso find out in the opens.. Just use a virus prog and run addaware or something every now and then.
Great tool if you just looking for that single song.

9.5/10"

,Wav3 CrackeR,2006-12-28T14:32Z,All versions of Limewire wants to install Java on your computer ... and thats where the frickin viruses and spywares comes from its not in the installer its the Java that ads virus on your computer .. when i installed it my anti virus got dicabled and my firewall was down .. then when i restarted the computer nothing worked. So dont install Java from Limewire files go to Javas website and download it there to be on the safe side or use dc++ or utorrent. :(
,svenkhas,2007-01-07T22:29Z,"this is a very nice p2p prog to use for music and music videos if you know what you locking for even movies it works but i prefer torrents :D 

Gornax:

and by the way it is not the program that gives you virus that's bull it's what you download that gives you virus if you search for porn all the way that often can happen ;) "
,Hypnosis4U2NV,2007-01-09T04:24Z,"This is a good torrent..

If you are getting viruses and spyware after you install, follow these steps:

1) Monitor what you download
2) Get a GOOD AntiVirus program
3) Get some good spyware and malware removers
4) Repeat Step 1

,rowborough,2007-02-09T22:17Z,"limewire is great for one track downloads, just use some common and good anti virus software and for gods sake LOOK AT THE FILE SIZES you dowwload (how many twats download files at 80k that say they are film or games !!!!!!!   - you cant help some people)

If you are not very computer literate , or even worse a child that thinks because they are from the pc generation they must be Bill Gates (although most cant even string a sentance together), dont just download any old shit, ask people check what othrers say and use the best anti virus, adware spam, pop-up and phising software you can get.

To all of you that ignore these wise words, I hopr you get the worse dose of pc clap going, perhaps next time you will listen......."
,swedish-guy,2007-02-11T17:17Z,YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEES =DDDD I HAD LIMEWIRE NOW I GOTT PRO THANKS SO MUCH !!! =D
,bennnyy,2007-02-24T15:20Z,"gornax fuck off 
you have no idea what is a good program!!!
and it is not infected!! you stupid motherfucker"
,malcinblue,2007-06-21T18:51Z,"some good advice on here - if it's single music tracks you want then this is one of the best and quickest ways of getting them. Also a very useful feature is the ability to check out the hosts files. 
Finally, bennnyy - you are one angry guy, Gomax needs help not insults.... chill "
,m7F4Y3,2007-08-13T04:01Z,Very good for music. I don't like the newest version of limewire pro. Thanks for the upload:)
