,assweasel,2007-10-01T06:42Z,"Plays great in VLC. This was the all time shitty b movie. A ""horror"" flick that is also a musical? Get the fuck out of here. I love watching shitty movies but this was unwatchable"

The power of Christ impales you!"
,MarkInAtor,2008-06-13T19:44Z,"Don't really think this is as good as other troma movies ive seen but if ya aint seen a good movie in a while, you should download this. Tbh its probebly the worst troma movie ive seen but its still amazing!"
,COM.UNIST,2008-10-12T21:44Z,"Sounds like a great (as in crap as in good) movie, but this is not Troma, its by some Canadian company called Odessa Filmworks. Still, sounds great. Gonna get this."
