These are high quality despite their small size. Come on, Knightmare was never really a visually intensive programme was it? :)

Knightmare was a fantasy adventure game show, shown on Children\'s ITV in the UK between 1987 and 1994. It was created and produced by Tim Child and was a Broadsword Television production for Anglia Television/ITV. The show made extensive use of the \'Cromakey\' (blue screen) technique to generate rooms and scenes with different backgrounds and graphics.

The adventure was set mostly in a dungeon, and there were three \'levels\' corresponding to difficulty. Teams of four took it in turns to challenge the dungeon to complete a \'quest\' - usually to retrieve a symbolic object, such as a Crown or Shield. The dungeon master \'Treguard\', and his assistant occasionally helped teams along their way as they solved problems, puzzles and riddles

The \'dungeoneer\' is the one person of the team who is guided through the adventure, and wears a helmet to blind them from reality. He or She is guided by the three other members of the team, known as their \'advisors\', who sit in the dungeon ante-chamber and watch the adventure through a \'Magic Mirror\'.

The object of each quest was decided at the start, and teams would be awarded with a medal or FrightKnight trophy upon successful completion.
