,Wolfeee,2006-11-20T11:58Z,"Hello I have a little problem with this iso file.
I have tryied to transfer this to my Xbox but in won't work... :S   I have also tryied to burn in but it doesen't work.  Need some help please."
,kevbocat,2006-11-21T12:51Z,"Because of it's unusual size for an xbox game, it won't burn correctly using Nero Smart Start. You have to actually open up Nero and choose burn as a DVD-ISO. After dragging the file into the window, it will give you a pop-up telling you that ""you have added a single image file to an empty compilation..blah blah blah"" Click ""Yes"" and then in the new window that pops-up, click DVD from the drop down menu on the left, select DVD Image, your burn speed, etc, and away you go. Hope this helped. Good Luck"
,scorelord,2006-11-23T19:36Z,next time make the files fatx compatible please :)

Well instead of making a stupid comment zoltan_jeff, why don't you share it so everyone else can have it as well? Oh yeah, that's right! You don't care about the community. My fault."
,zoltan_jeff,2006-11-24T16:26Z,"Well, i got a bad internet connection...I can´t seed a hole torrent, just seed the things i´ve already downloaded. If i put something up here, it would take days for the first person to get it =/ Sorry..."

,GeXiUs,2006-11-26T02:30Z,Does it work if i put it in HDD? and if that so! where should i put it?  anywhere?
,Streetlights,2006-11-27T06:29Z,"Yeah, I'm just wondering the same as Gexius, if I unpack the file, can I use Quix to put it across to the HD and run it from there?"
,thizock,2006-11-29T07:19Z,i downloaded this burned it with nero but my xbox wont read it.  do i have to have a chip? cab anyone help?  thanks alot.  i love this community thanks guys
