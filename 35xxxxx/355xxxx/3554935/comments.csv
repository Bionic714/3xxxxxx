Hey dumbbass, the Flight1 PC12 (2.1 download version) is crackeable with the first  unwrapper, called deflorator, the green Flight1- DOS prompt.  You get to make a ""fake"" key , Offline, then it will mark the register with the kay, you can call it dumbbass or anything. Then it unwraps to  PC-12.exe and installs.
Now, you cannot go in the Internet with FS9 running, unless you lock your HOSTS file, because Flight1 will ""de-activate"" it by remote.

Bellow is some failed attempts with the PC-12.

Mine works perfect.

,colimodio,2006-11-11T18:11Z,"BTW= the same goes for Flight1
Cessna 172R
ATR-72-500
Baron 59
Bonanza a36
Cessna 441 & 310 & 152

for me at least all work perfect. Unwrap with deflorator, make key and install. Then avoid Flight1 in the Net. (Including installing with them legally, this will f*ck up all the illegal planes you installed before)"

,dreddhk,2007-02-09T17:47Z,"What is this god crap in the readme? I dont understand what rock these guys have been living under .. And I quote:


/rant


The events that have unfolded in the past several years, we would never have thought would have occurred 10 years ago. [Must be living under a rock!]  Elements of changes in world power, focus upon the Middle East, battle cries of holy wars, nuclear threats, thousands of innocents taken in a single morning, the list goes on. [Yep, as it has since, ohh, I don't know, pre roman times perhaps?]

These events were prophesied in the Holy Bible, and one by one, they have begun to 'occur' in quick [By quick, you mean you've finaly noticed?]  order and succession.  There are now not that many signs left of the 'end of this age', and the soon to occur 'seven year war of Armageddon'. [7 years of war ... LOL - fukn idiots! When, in the last couple of hundred years, have we not been at war at some point somewhere? Hmmm??]

And the rest is just some guy how can't think for himself preaching old testerment rubbish ... next thing we'll be told that ""god"" put the dinosaur bones under the ground as some kinda cosmic joke to catch out the satanist .. please keep your shitty religous crap outta our flight sim! WANKERS ... saying that (and boy do I feel better, 6 years of bible study have a lot to answer for!!)
