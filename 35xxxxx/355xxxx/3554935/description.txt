I have tested this 1 a good bit the last couple of days & it is a very nice plane to fly. The alternate vies can take some getting used to but once you are used to them it\\\'s almost like FSX has come to FS9.

I would suggest a nice VFR flight around the updated Vancouver scenery.

Thanks again to Supaturtle or the file....it\\\'s people like this that keep the community going.
