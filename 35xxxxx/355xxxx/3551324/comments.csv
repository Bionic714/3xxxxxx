,pcy70,2006-11-05T08:31Z,"Thanks! That's an interesting offer. But I have 32kbyte/s upload, and I upload about 6 hours a day. We're talking about 6gig of data. I can also upload them to usenet. alt.binaries.comp. I have to think about how I'm going to do this."
,Deznaj,2006-11-05T10:03Z,How about a pack with of 50 - 100 Mad magazines in .cbr format at once? Seed until it is widly distributed (20 seeders or so) and then do another. I wouldn't mind waiting a few weeks to get ALL Mad Magazines.
