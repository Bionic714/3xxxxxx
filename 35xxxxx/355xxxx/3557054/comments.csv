it works upto the point where the WGA Diag tool. Then I tried installing IE7 only to find it unable to validate my windows. 

After using the WGA Diag tool again it says it's invalid product key. I guess they're banning new keys generated by included key gen.

,segot,2007-01-21T00:29Z,"These programs work, for me at least. Some people complain that the generated key don´t work, these people probably have a copy of WinXp that needs a VLK key, that is a Volume Licence Key, so select this option in the keygen.
For the people that says that this post contains viruses, I can say that some Antivirus programs indicates viruses because this post includes a key-generator, which is used to crack pirated software and therefore are treated as malicious software even if it doesn´t do any harm to your computer. Anyone that is in doubt about any piece of software should upload it to www.virustotal.com for scanning. This site is totally trustworthy, and they scan your soft with several different and respected antivirus scanners."

,Assass1n,2007-01-31T20:20Z,"Now it works. I ignored the warning and ran the thing anyway. If you get the ""Cryptographic error"" it is likely that you have not installed the WGA at all, and this must be done prior to doing this operation.

,o_motors,2007-05-03T11:12Z,"This package is just awesome! Before I downloaded and used it, my really rarely used WMP 10 pop the screen which promised an update, which was nothing else but WMP version 11 I previously deleted form my system because I did not like Vista skin. The whole MS trick with passing that update is to suck you into getting use to Vista look but that of course many people don?t realize and get screwed when they download a version they cannot use ? simply sad, the richest moron on the planet cannot put 2+ 2 together and build the OS that can match Apple?s so he uses tricks to get pure souls to pay for upgrading to 6 years old Windows XP. Back to this torrent, rRight after I followed clearly stated instruction, my downloaded WMP11 unlocked just fine in the meter of seconds. The package does not have viruses or Trojans and whatever program reports them just uninstall it and get McAfee Enterprise version and Ad-Aware SE Professional and you?d be just fine. The false Trojan reporting is known issue with lesser quality programs, which see all key generators as potentially malicious programs. Thanks for sharing this great torrent! "

,MrKassner,2011-03-20T09:22Z,"Included instructions didn't fully work for me, however after some guessing I got it to work. Here you go for anyone wanting to try them:
1. Open ""Windows XP Keygen"" and select ""Windows XP Pro."" (NOT ""Windows XP Pro. VDK"") and click ""Generate""
2. Open ""keyfinder"", go to the ""Options"" menu and click ""Change Windows Key"" then in the window that comes up enter the key made in step 1 then exit ""keyfinder"".
3. Open ""wga-fix"" and click ""Yes""
4. Open ""MGADiag"" and click ""Continue"" then ""OK""
5. Go to Start Menu - All Programs - Activate Windows - and enter the product key from step 1.
6. Your finished.

So far I've been able to fully use Windows Update and have used the OS about an hour now in a VM, not a single problem but will see how it goes in the long run. Either way thanks!"
