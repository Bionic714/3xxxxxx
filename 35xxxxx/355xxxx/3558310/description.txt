Gimme Something Lyric:
Gimme, gimme something! Gimme something for this joy
Gimme, gimme something! Gimme something for this boy

I don´t care wich you choose, green, red, white or blue
Just give me something, uh uh uh uuuuh!!

Gimme, gimme something! Gimme something for tonight
Gimme, gimme something! Gimme something that is right

I want something for this evening! I want something for this perfect night!

Gimme, gimme something! Gimme something for this dance
Gimme, gimme something! Gimme something for this stance

Gimme, gimme something! Gimme something my luck
Gimme, gimme something! I really don´t give a fuck




This is our own netrelease. If you find any of these songs in another release from another group, then they have taken the mp3's from our release. These songs are not available on cd or any other media, this is encoded directly from project mixdown masters. I'm releasing it like this for those who are like me and hate crappy releases, separate songs and messy mp3-folders. And for those who have filthy computers, just put the files in your chaotic mp3-directory, but please, at least don't rename them. Renamers should be strangled!
