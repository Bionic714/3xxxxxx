Nice to see an OTL release, long time since last I saw one =)"
,segnicom,2006-11-08T15:51Z,"Prob is, it keeps telling me that it can't validate my version, and only lets me play the Demo version. "
,BOT9787,2006-11-10T20:41Z,"Hi segnicom :)

Edit the ""nwncdkey.ini"" file and insert the OTL key (or read *PROPER INSTALL*) ... FULL WORKING  !!!"
,Exertim,2006-11-14T23:35Z,"Ok, how do you insert the key itself? I have 3 lines saying Key1 =  Key2=  etc, but inserting Key4 for OTL does not work, and I'm not seeing any PROPER INSTALL text file on the cd or anything."
,Exertim,2006-11-14T23:43Z,"Nvm, figured it out. Thanks for the release!"
,erikj12251,2006-11-15T23:35Z,please help! I followed the directions even installing the dameon tools got the torrent to extract and load followed  the instructions on how to enter the key but I'm still stuck on the play demo 
,Sinnersfury,2006-11-19T17:21Z,"Actually, it seems to work if you enter the OTL key as number 1 and just shift the others to 2,3 and 4. =/

On the other hand, it also seems to end very abruptly about halfway as do other premium modules like Witch's Wake if not fully paid for =("
