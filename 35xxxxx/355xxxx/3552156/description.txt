     ¦ As you crest a hill on your noble warhorse, a  bleak sight un ¦
     ¦ folds before  you Cormyr, the land of  your birth, is scarred ¦
     ¦ and ravaged by a creeping blight. Once-green fields lie brown ¦
     ¦ and dead, smoke rises from farms, and village homesteads that ¦
     ¦ have fallen ramshackle and decrepit.                          ¦

     ¦ You have returned to your home with intentions of aiding your ¦
     ¦ family in rebuilding their lives from the ashes of wars past. ¦
     ¦ Yet  though  peace  seems  to  have  finally returned to this ¦
     ¦ troubled land, outlaws still lurk in  the wilds and a strange ¦
     ¦ silence has descended over the Hullack forest.                ¦
