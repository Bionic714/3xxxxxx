,lildarkangel,2007-10-14T22:29Z,How do I get the sound?
,Divine_Bob,2008-03-28T09:34Z,Hey where the hell is my sound. Windows media player needs a codec that doesn't exist and DivX just won't play it. jboo7 you are a bad person for toying with people like this because i love this film. I won't be seeding it because there is no point in anyone else downloading it.
,doaivu999,2008-04-04T21:32Z,try vlc
,horrorkitty,2008-07-07T12:58Z,"Excellent quality.  he sound worked great in Winamp, VLC, and WMP....... Thank you"
,Kjelsaasbjornen,2008-07-15T22:49Z,"Why oh WHY dont people use VLC player?
It comes with the codecs ppl! Just download vobsub in addition and youre ready to go with the subtitles too!
