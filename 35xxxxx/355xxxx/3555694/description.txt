Media dubbed Mobile Homes "the Swedish Depeche Mode", probably because Depeche Mode was the only international synth band they knew of, and Mobile Homes was the only Swedish synth band they knew of. Well, naturally, there are some similarities, since most synth bands today are more or less influenced by these giants, but musically they're a lot closer to German bands like Camouflage and De/Vision, maybe with a few hints of Depeche Mode 86 - 89 or so. 

    It seems band is constantly unhappy about things, whining and feeling sorry for themselves, complaining about lost love, the polluted environment, the cold modern society or just life in general (or even the weather). Their particular kind of whining can be liked though. Sometimes they over-do it, but it's mostly good and works with the genre. Other strong features of the band are the melodies and synth sounds.
