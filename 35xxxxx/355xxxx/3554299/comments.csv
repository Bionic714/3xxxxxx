,fragm,2007-02-06T16:44Z,This release has stability issues.  It keeps crashing on me.  Using WinXP and AMD64 (not overclocked).
,Huith,2008-01-11T17:06Z,Installed OK but crashes each time I try to add a list of FLAC files.
,FrejaSolAurora,2008-02-10T14:53Z,where is the code!!!
,kirinis,2008-06-10T16:15Z,"Very good program, works perfectly. I originally tried version 4.8 from ThePirateBay but this has a problem in that the registration does not work (it appear to but doesn't) so it remains in trial mode. 
This verion does not have this problem"
