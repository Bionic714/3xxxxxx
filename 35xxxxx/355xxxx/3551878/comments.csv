,aposess,2007-03-14T01:30Z,I get the same error message. Something about integer divided by 0. Can someone help me?
,TiNVeL,2007-08-03T22:21Z,"If you get that error: Reboot/insert disc/ when asked if you want to test your system, simply click ""no"". Worked for me.

,miknos,2008-03-29T20:56Z,"I had this game! The box containing the cd's where great. If the where possible to convert the video to another format, probably the game would be much smaller in size."
,lvasylp,2008-08-01T16:59Z,"When the game asks me to switch cd's I have to exit out of the game and mount the second iso in daemontools, but when I return to the game it asks me to switch back to the first cd. I've tried mounting two at once, but it doesn't work. How do I get past this?"
,Chemaporita,2008-08-03T03:25Z,"I have downloaded all the 7 disks, but disk # 3 says is not a valid image, either with nero, Daemon Tools or Magic ISO. Is that image wrong, or is just me? I would download it again, but it took me a while and idk if it is worth a try..."
[T],spotswood,2008-08-20T09:31Z,seven cd's!? wtf
,jceszz,2008-08-23T02:10Z,"will it work with windows vista 64 bits?
how can i make it work? help.
thanks."
,digglerdirk,2008-09-06T07:36Z,"I have a problem with disk 5. says its not a valid image... I am re dowlaoding that iso from the torrent.

Install was tricky but game works fine. except i am stuck at the end of chapter 4 and cannot progress because i got a bad disk 5 iso.

Wehn you are prompted to run the preinstall tests, i got the interger dived by 0 thing at the cdrom test. i guess it failed because its a virtual drive? 
Also I failed the windows version test. It says its for windows 3.1 dos and win95. 
(released in 1995... wtf is windows xp? lol )

Solution: skip the tests. and ""install anyway"" or what ever it says about install this version of windows or something. its an old game and doest not do a bunch of stuff to install. its really quick only requirs disk 1 and is about 30 seconds.

in all this is great, even though i cant finish the game yet.. i have all other disk iso's and just need 5, and i should find it i hope. 

Thank you jva65 for the post."

use alt+tab? and then just mount next disc image on the same virtual drive. give it a minute to recognise the new image and then use alt+tab to go back to game. then click the next chapter option not return to menu.

I hope that helps."
,digglerdirk,2008-09-07T04:48Z,redownloaded DISC 5 iso and IT WORKS GREAT!!
,thewatchmaker,2008-10-24T18:14Z,"also having a prob with disc 5, crashes at funny thing in conservatory, no spoilers intended. digglerdick, could you tell me how to download just disc 5 iso from the torrent instead of the whole nearly 4 gig download? or did you download the whole thing again?"
,steveporter,2008-12-05T02:55Z,"works with windows vista 64 bits.

some notes:

- you will see a message that says ""setup needs to test your system in order to make sure it can run phantasmagoria - do you want to perform this test before installing?"" click NO.

- you will see some errors but ignore them and continue with the windows installation anyway and it will install fine. now go to C:/SIERRA/SCARY (where the game installs by default)then right click on the SIERRAW.EXE file then click on >Send to > Desktop (create shortcut). right click on the shortcut then choose ""properties."" click on the compatibility tab then check the box to run the program in compatibility mode for windows 95... under display settings, check where it says ""run in 256 colors"" and ""run in 640x 480 screen resolution"".

- The game crashes at Disc 5!! That is when you go the conservatory and click on the fountain in the center of the room. You need to skip through the next 2 scenes by pressing quickly the "">>"" button 
It does prevent the game from locking up."
,poissonmagique,2008-12-08T17:50Z,"ANYBODY HAVE THE FILE ""SIERRAW.EXE""? I JUST NEED THIS FILE, AS I HAVE ALREADY DOWNLOADED THE WHOLE GAME, BURNED IT ON A DVD, DELETED THE DOWNLOAD, JUST TO SEE THIS FILE IS MISSING!

ANYBODY, PLS EMAIL ME THE FILE AT utopiancorp@yahoo.com AND THEN LET ME KNOW HERE.(SPAMMERS, DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT, IT'S NOT MY PRIMARY EMAIL AND I DON'T CHECK IT OFTEN AT ALL)

THANKS GUYS"

,is123,2009-07-27T12:23Z,"I can play only the 1st CD because I only have the autoplay and it does not let me choose the next CD when i'm finished with the 1st one. I wont even have the images of 1st, 2nd ... CDs, just the autoplay. Any ideas how to get to the 2nd CD anyway?"
,NerdCore47,2009-10-17T06:43Z,"Playing it now - perfectly - on windows 7 x64. Just google ""new installers for sierra games"" and download the installer - MAKE SURE YOU HAVE DOSBOX INSTALLED IN THE CORRECT PLACE (C:\Program Files (x86) for x64 or C:\Program Files for x86). If you have issues, just rename the DOSBOX folder ""DOSBox"", and it'll work like a charm."
,Pishakins,2011-12-29T19:54Z,"Has anyone figured out how to get it to run on windows 7?? I went nuts trying to find this game, and i cannot seem to get it to work on a windows 7 system!!! If it wont work, I'm gonna get a windows xp p.c. just for this game, i swear it!!! But I'd rather not.... Any suggestions or fixes to my dilemma??"
,Pishakins,2011-12-29T21:01Z,"^^^^  I even got the sierra installer and DOSBox. I ran the initial instillation and it completely finished. It gave me the shortcut to run the game, but when i click on it, it only tries to reinstall DOSBox or something like that, instead of actually running the game...... Must I actually burn a copy of the disk to play or can't I just use a virtual drive like Daemon to run it??? Someone give me a suggestion as to what i need to be doing.... mabye there is a step I totally missed???"
,eric_n1,2012-02-26T01:08Z,"@thewatchmaker:
you don't need to redownload the ISO.
You are running Phantasmagoria on Windows XP I take it?
Yes, there is a FMV issue on Disk 5, which only manifests itself when you play the game on Windows XP. I played it on DOSBox and it works great, no issues."
