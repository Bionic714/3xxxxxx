Here's the last of the shipwrecked shows. I hope you enjoy them. I beg you to seed what you have as long as you can. I will keep the torch lit while I can, but please show your thanks and keep these things seeded. I know most of you won't. This did take me a lot of time to get downloaded and a lot of bandwidth to then have them uploaded. I dedicate it all to Gus. Comment if you like.
