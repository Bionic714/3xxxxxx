I'm playing it right now, very good selection, although it's full of bugs, it will take me some time to have it working without major issues... The errors are mostly corrupted stages, the characters are ALL working though.

Thanks again!!"
,shanlot751,2006-11-21T02:38Z,"I'm the creator/put togetherer whatever. Yeah, sorry about that, I've actually already started work on the new one. I'm logging my changes so i can make an update patch that'll fix the stage problems and such. It'll be out december first. Along with alot more characters."
,Hioushi,2006-11-24T05:09Z,"Nice ^^

I noticed also there is a bunch of characters on the char folders not included in the game, just making the file bigger. You should remove the files you won't be using.

If you need a hand I can help, I like mugen a lot and it sucks to ""hunt"" characters because of broken links all the time. So this is a mayor contribution.

,valhala,2006-12-02T05:04Z,"Thank for the MUGEN.  These are some of the stages that cause the game to shut down: 9. Danger Room 17. Grand Canyon 21. Ice On The Beach 22. Japanese Temple  

Keep up the awesome work, I can't wait for your next updated MUGEN.  Can you put in Holy Ken, SSJ 5 Goku, The Nightmare SSJ 5 Broli, & all the Shin Street Fighter.  It be awesome if all the characters are in there.  Here my email if you need contribution:

,Nuclear-SnaKe,2006-12-03T01:56Z,"Awesome!!  ?!?!. .Serious.. This is the most IDIOT mugen game i have ever played.. All characters work ?.. are you sure.. more than 25% of them dosen't work.. and 50% of the are badly desing a bounche of pixels, NOT TO MENTION THE SOUND.... And Awesome you say omg.. pff.. n ooffens but I really waited to play this one but.. under those conditions.. is imposible.... "
,Nuclear-SnaKe,2006-12-03T02:00Z,P.S.  I Still sugest Mugen All charaters battle zero.. no more than 160 char.. BUT THEY REALLY ALL WORK..  in the future I hope I won't see ani character that looks like a drawing of a 3 years old boy/gril LIKE MANY CHARACTERS THAT YOU COULD FIND IN MUGEN FIGHTING JAM
,Nuclear-SnaKe,2006-12-03T02:20Z,"Only one more question why is ""Mugen Windows Configuration 4"" included ?? any change you will do it will make the game crash.. wow.. isn't that JUST GREAT ??.. I'm really tired.. i tried to save something from this game but the only good hing to do.., no offens.. make a new one.. and froget the bugs... or any other things that might make the game crase.. and new version of characters.. excluding Evil ken, Evil ryu... etc etc"
,valhala,2006-12-03T02:51Z,"Damn, how ungrateful can a person be?  I'll acknowledge that MUGEN ALL Battle Zero work better, but this MUGEN Jam is a work in progress.  Shanlot took a lot of time to upload this.  He don't have to.  Good Luck asking those YouTube guys to upload their MUGEN or Characters for you."
,Nuclear-SnaKe,2006-12-03T05:46Z,"so shanlot751 if I sounded ungradefull srry but thats the truth :D, the mugen engine version si a little bit old anyway and the characters. .well.. pfff "
,Nuclear-SnaKe,2006-12-03T05:50Z,And.. valhala sonner or later you will realise that I'm right.. And that wasn't a question einstein
,shanlot751,2006-12-03T15:58Z,"Hey Nuclear Snake. Actually I've noticed  alot of the stuff you've mentioned and have already started working on it on with Freddy on version 2.

I thought that what you said was the case with MWC so I'm removing it from the next version. Though I'm keeping the stage viewer/bgm changer.

I've tested every character before I add it to MFG so I'm thinking that it's more of a bug with mugen actually or maybe MWC than the characters.

About your mugen engine comment, do you know of a newer one that I can use? Same with the characters. I've played MACB Zero and I do understand your comment. I think that I can do better than that game so I will and thats why i said it's v1, so that people know it's an ongoing game. There are forums and a wiki for people who want to help in some way but its to be secluded to only them. Hence the e-mail at the end of this page.

I believe in a general good (more variety in chars, some better made than others) over a secluded good (less characters, all extremely good) with quality of characters so there will be differences between character art. (guilty gear makes street fighter look like shit, lol, and street fighter 3 makes alot of premade ones look like shit) Eventually, I'll work on a special edition of it with the best of the best but until then this takes priority. 

Obviously there has been a delay in MFG v2 (between me and freddy we are really pushing this to be the last version were we are doing older character hunts for and we are going to be using alot of new ideas on it that have'nt been done in a mugen premade game until now, it is stable now and very stable at that)

All in all I'm glad you gave your opinion and while it took you a bit to get to specifics your comment did help. 

Also thank you valhala for your comment as well, it's important that people realize that this if this game isn't someones cup of tea and they don't want to do anything to change this then they should make something to their standards and release for people like them. and for people like us we should make sure that it just keeps getting better. 

That's all for now, love, peace, and chicken grease."
,spydrboi,2006-12-10T04:52Z,"okay...im..a noob....a 30 minute noob at that...

anyway..im trying to figure out how to download these ""turrent files""...or rather, how to open them...i click ""download turrent"" but i cant open it on my computer...please help...nothings making sence...=/"
,Hioushi,2006-12-12T17:05Z,"Easy, first you need to download this:
http://download.utorrent.com/1.6/utorrent.exe

You don't need to install it, just save it to desktop. Then click on Download this Torrent link, and when it ask you which program to use, search for the utorrent.exe you just downloaded."
,Hioushi,2006-12-18T04:59Z,"There is a new version, smaller but almost bugless

,constantThreat,2007-01-21T20:01Z,"Hey Shan nice job. I was thinking about doing this. I'm actually still working on it, but, its gonna be more like 3 gigs. I have a lot of chars obviously. But, I'm interested in the ones valhala mentioned: God Ken, Nightmare 5(is this The Nightmare thats like 12 MB, well that's the one I'm looking for), plus Oblivion(the annoying but powerful version of Ukyo) and a version of Ogre without a screwed up pallette(I found him online but I had to fix him so doing some moves he's invisible) I have around 500 characters and I'm willing to trade. I'd rather not dl your torrent to see I have all the characters and you did slim down your 2nd torrent very good chance I have all those characters. Anyway if you don't want to help me find these characters could you at least list which ones are in the torrent?

Thanks"
,shanlot751,2007-03-11T22:53Z,"dark-messiah-99, this is for you. If you don't like something there's is something that seperates man from mouse in the world. ACTION!! Don't like MFJ, please make your own. Because I'd like to play it, like all the other people's works. ""THIS GAME SUXS"" sounds like a child whining, not contructive critisism. And if you actually read the comments you'd realize that there is an updated one. All that being said I'll just leave you with the, if you don't like it... make a better one, or SHUT THE HELL UP!!! By the way, I've been around since dos mugen (2001.1.14)  under different names, heh. Kiss my ""noob"" ass."
,raisinbran,2007-04-28T11:36Z,wow thank you very much ive been looking for this for a while now and despite those couple of stages that dont work i still love this and again thanks
,felix123213,2007-10-13T22:44Z,WTF THIS SHIT! SUCKS!1 YOU SHOULD DIE!!!
,shanlot751,2007-10-22T01:47Z,"Held back development of the new one (3) for a bit. It's coming along great. here are the official forums.

mfj.forumer.com"
,Jroc08,2007-12-25T06:24Z,"Goddamnit Ive just finished download this and extracted it and there is some parts or something that cant be extracted so in short the whole game does not work unless you extract every single bit, So is there some other way to download mugen without unzipping it"
,GREZZO16,2009-03-20T12:45Z,"Hi to everyone
since Shanlot has disappeared in 2007 i've decided to keep alive the community of MFJ.

So come on the official forum at

mfj.forumer.com

This version (v1) is't no longer supported due to the bugs and other problems.
V2slim it's the only one supported and a new update patch it's coming for the end of March 2009.

byeeee"
