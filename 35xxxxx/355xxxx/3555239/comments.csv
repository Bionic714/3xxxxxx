,malianteo921,2006-11-11T18:52Z,I have a question cuz I'm a lil confused. In amazon they're pre-ordering Kingdom Come but it has 17 tracks and all the torrents I see for this album have only 14 tracks. What's up with that. check for your self @ http://www.amazon.com/Kingdom-Come-Jay-Z/dp/B000JJSRUM/sr=8-1/qid=1163267043/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/102-9367140-7831361?ie=UTF8&s=music
,randombastards,2006-11-11T19:16Z,"Look at the last 3 tracks on the Amazon tracklist... they're new versions of old tracks from Reasonable Doubt. Bonus stuff that apperently isn't on the leaked version.

Feel me?"
