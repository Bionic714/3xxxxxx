Rockers 1978

The best reggae film ever made. Loose plot of gangsters and rastas wrapped up in glorious Jamaican patois (with English subtitles), contains some of the best reggae artists of the era, and lots of praising Jah with smoke and music.

Teasers:

I-man serve Selassie I continually. No matter what the weak heart say. And I know that I & I is like a tree, plant by the river of water, and not even the dog that piss against the wall of Babylon shall escape this judgment. For I & I know that all of the youth shall witness the day that Babylon shall fall!

The Ital scene is coverage. One need the Ital in ever'ting to survive. The Ital don't stop. So I and I forward within this time.
