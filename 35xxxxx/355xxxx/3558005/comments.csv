,ThePizzaMan111,2006-12-08T10:52Z,Yo!!  i´v downloaded about 2 gig og this torrent and then everything just died  whats wrong??
,naske1,2007-01-12T16:28Z,"kan ingen seeda med snabbare uppladdning. Har 8mbit, tankar vanligtviss i 850kb/s. Nu tankar jag denna runt 20kb/s. Är ju på 11gb kommer ju ta år och dar att få ner denna serie."
,sectest,2007-04-05T00:33Z,"There is a lot of doubles here. 

Episodes E11 to E20 are all unnecessary and included in the ""WSOP 2006 - Main Event""-files.

So if you are going to download this release, uncheck (don't download) the files E11-E20 and you will save a lot of downloading time.

Otherwise a great release!"
,kondo,2007-08-19T12:12Z,"This download is crap, I've tried to download it twice and when it reaches nearly 50 - 60% it stops and says something about truncated files..."
,kondo,2007-08-20T00:43Z,"Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

I'll have to retract from what I said. It seems that the download stopped because of a technical problem (the damn S*agate Hard Disk had some sectors ""down"" - apparently repaired with the corresponding tool).

At least now it seems to go on."
