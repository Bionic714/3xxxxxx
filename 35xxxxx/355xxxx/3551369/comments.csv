,majtymicke,2006-11-05T00:01Z,"This is cut, Tom Savini himself cut out alot of footage so it could be released without someone else cutting it. So there is not one single uncut edition out there but maybe in the future it will be released uncut."
,Wetbones,2006-11-05T02:15Z,Which is exactly why I've not purchased the DVD until now but I'll gladly download and watch it.
