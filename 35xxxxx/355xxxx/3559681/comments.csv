,colimodio,2006-11-18T19:10Z,"Guys, i wrote about this on this link:

http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3557600/FS2004_Project_Sierra_Hotel_T37_Tweet

in other words, by going to flight 1's website and downloading the original wrapped file, the by using the deflorator - do you all know what that is...- and with deflorator you can unwrap the baron (bonanza too!) and get it installed the way it was meant to be...but without you paying money...remember to go OFFLINE when you are deflorating  or un-wrapping any flight1 stuff. --at least until they change the wrapper version to the new  version , the one which is UN-CRACKEABLE..!!!!

Also, about what i mention ""remote disconnect"" your illegal (deflorator born) keys    ;0

Do you know what deflorator is???"
,neslesman,2006-11-18T20:06Z,"""remote disconnect"" your illegal (deflorator born) keys ;0""

and just how do we do that, where is it etc.etc.etc. and what does it do? "
,bushbear,2006-11-18T20:53Z,"they dissable the keys made using deflorator to install software in your PC. You merryly install all and run it and then after you are flying ONLINE FS9 or just downloading real-weather, etc. while you run FS( and -poof- your keys go away and next time you try to load the flight1 plane (with the illegal key) it says something to the effect: illegal or pirated ket,"
,neslesman,2006-11-19T00:07Z,Ok I figured it was something like that.  Now if I  only knew how to disable them.  
,bushbear,2006-11-19T14:47Z,"OK you want knowledge...mmm. Blocking access inside your PC to outside programms, or programms that try to access out, ; AND the HOST file (inside C: Windows/System32/drivers/etc/host)

http://accs-net.com/hosts/what_is_hosts.html

explains a lot, but if you Google HOST you'll learn a lot.

As far as i can limited tell, Firewalls, Routers, Norton Internet, Avast Internet, Anti-Virus (it's not a virus) don't always stop these unauthorized access into your PC...basically i download with a MAC, put it on CD and go to my (now) superfast PC and run an antivirus on the CD and then only then i install the software downloaded. This PC NEVER is connected to Internet. The 727v2 flight1 i got i installed first before anything else, then the others got installed.
OK, i need the GARMIN 1000 Cessna 182...please....req.

Bye..."
,neslesman,2006-11-19T19:41Z,"Thanks bushbear, that's a very enlightening web site.  Learned a lot today.
