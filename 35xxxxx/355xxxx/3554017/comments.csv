,Catz1987,2007-01-04T18:50Z,"Hey! Loved this. Also, haven't you perchance more songs by Bobby Gaylor? It would be a real treat. I've searched all over torrent community. :("
,Resurrection,2007-02-10T02:36Z,"Thanks! No18, ""Vapour Trail"""", I guess itÂ´s Andy Bell singing, but whoÂ´s the girl?"
,jimnick,2007-02-13T22:00Z,"Thx, good selection!

Catherine Wheel track is actually 'Judy Staring At The Sun'. :-)"
,hobmisterrob,2007-05-19T05:10Z,"To clear up any confusion...
Track 8 is actually ""Kitchens of Distinction""
The last track, ""Vaportrail"" is by ""Ride"". The beginning part is actually ""Mazzy Star"" covering the song, and someone fused the two songs together...which is why it cuts funny in the middle."
