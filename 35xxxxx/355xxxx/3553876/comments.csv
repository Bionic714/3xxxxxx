,AntiAntonAnt,2006-11-08T22:31Z,"Hmm, is the name of the emulator Xbox or what? Sounds odd with ""Xbox NES Emulator"" :/"
,kevbocat,2006-11-08T22:59Z,"The name of the emulator is called ""Mednafenx NES v8"".

Guys, also be patient with the speeds. I'm trying to resolve this issue. It should be uploading faster but it's not."
,Teknothug,2006-11-09T00:35Z,"what i think he is trying to say is that...

Its an emulator that lets you play burnt NES games on your Xbox"
,kevbocat,2006-11-09T01:04Z,"I'll try to make this a little clearer for people still having a problem understanding. This is an emulator that contains about 3,500 NES games. Just burn the ISO as you would burn any other backup game and you should be fine."
,SoundWall,2006-11-09T06:39Z,"Why not just download your emulator(s) from xbins and decide which one you want, since this one I've never heard of, and it's always good to check different emu's out.

Anways, nice of you to upload all these roms kevbocat, although I prefer SNES games myself."
,Krommie,2006-11-10T13:57Z,"Hmm I cant burn this, too big for a cdr, when I try to burn it on a dvdr nero and dvddecrypter wont burn it...help?"
,kevbocat,2006-11-10T19:11Z,"Because of it's unusual size for an xbox game, it won't burn correctly using Nero Smart Start. You have to actually open up Nero and choose burn as a DVD-ISO. After dragging the file into the window, it will give you a pop-up telling you that ""you have added a single image file to an empty compilation..blah blah blah"" Click ""Yes"" and then in the new window that pops-up, click DVD from the drop down menu on the left, select DVD Image, your burn speed, etc, and away you go. Hope this helped. Good Luck"
,*namaste*,2006-11-10T22:37Z,Hey thanks a lot for this kevbocat
,birdcrap,2006-11-12T09:44Z,"Thanks kevbocat, just burned it to disc and it runs perfect!"
,Fredde_1888,2006-11-18T20:26Z,Cool. Thanks kevbocat.
,MoongereMeow,2006-11-29T06:19Z,"I can't seem to burn this to a dvd-r it keeps automaticly trying to burn it to a cd-r.
i says its a cd iso
i have nero 6.6"
,Jesusv06,2006-12-08T04:27Z,"Sweet!! It does have the game Pitfall!! OMG dude i love you for uploading this fine torrent =]   As for people having difficulties burning this image for me it worked fine i used DVD Decrypter(best program for burning xbox ""backups"") at writing speed of 4X with a Maxell DVD+R's. Works good with my NTSC xbox =] "
,Jesusv06,2006-12-08T04:38Z,"Oopps lol nevermind my previous post its about another emulator. which is at http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3554070/Xbox_Atari_Emulator_with_533_Games

 ANd right now im about to try this NES Emulator! Thanks upload =] "
,DemskeetSkeet,2006-12-16T20:18Z,"Hi, I have nero 6.3.0.0 and was wondering how I were able to burn this to a dvd+r using this version of nero. Do I need to convert the file type or can I just burn it onto dvd then play it on my pc.

Thanks"
,DemskeetSkeet,2006-12-16T20:25Z,"Hi, just got done downloading it and was wondering how I get it to work. I have the winrar program but i am unsure on how to use it to get this emulator to work. I would like to put it onto a dvd+r from nero 6.3.0.0, and then delete it from my hard drive.

Thanks, please hurry"

 do i need a modchip?
 if i do which one do you recommend?  
which program should i use to burn it?
at what speed?"
,winja,2007-06-10T22:55Z,you do need mod chip for xbox to play emulators. use executer 2.6 or 3.0 and slayers evox. dont burn to disk FTP or qwix them ftp is easier just use flashxp. for more info go to team executer site.
,MoonGeese,2007-08-03T20:34Z,"If modded Xbox is necessary for playing, this should be mentioned in the info text.

Do you have a read me, or can you point me in the direction of one that explains all the features of this emulator ie. how to put certain games into my favorites, how to alter the controller buttons, etc, etc.?

Also if you have the new iXtreme software anyone can play online no problem, and if you have the right programs it will stealth check and patch every game and burn all in one process for you....these programs are available for macs and pcs mac use iBurn360 it will patch and burn it for you and pc's use clonecd with xdvdmulleter to stealth check"
