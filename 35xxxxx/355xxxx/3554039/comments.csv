,hakimdjebbar113,2006-11-11T02:18Z,is it a screener?????and how's the audio quality???
,Loughtus,2006-11-11T21:24Z,"Don't download this!
Somethings fucked with the framrate, looks like it's 10 frames/second or something. Video quality mediocre
Wait for a better release!"
,PIV Patriots,2006-11-12T01:44Z,How do I get the audio codec? There's no sound when playing in Media Player.
,anal61,2006-11-13T05:21Z,google for K-lite codec pack and you will be able to play any video available.
,Lusekoftan,2006-11-14T15:00Z,hello! anyone knows if there is swedish subs anywhere for this movie?? tx!

,Wetbones,2006-11-19T00:15Z,we know the movie is good now tell me more about the quality of this rip
,infen,2006-11-20T20:14Z,det är bra bild men ljudet är före
,vangelis1492,2006-11-20T23:36Z,"CRAP! 10 FPS, something totally wrong with the sound midway in cd2!! Fucked up music and noise suddenly came on top of the movie sound.
MY GOD, cant anyone check before they upload CRAP like this?"
,MrEd,2006-11-23T23:12Z,"Yeah, sound is fucked up here too"
,Roflfeathers,2006-12-09T08:26Z,"Don't listen to the RIAA bastards above with the whole 10 fps bullcrap. THis rip is perfect. Looks great, sounds great, and is one of the best films of 2006. Let them try and sow the seeds of doubt in our minds but we should remind ourselves whose community this is; Our's or Their's?"
,karvane,2006-12-11T19:12Z,"Yeah, have to agree that the framerate is messed up on this one. it might not be 10fps, but you will notice the jittering. "
,crazyfingerz,2006-12-16T00:44Z,"you have got to be frickin joking me. i have NO sound, and i am a real person, who just wants to see thisz movie.  niether of the discs have sound. the video part works fine, but no volume whatsoever! i hope i dont have to re torrent this. does anyone have a suggestion for another toreent for this movie?"
,bradc1988,2006-12-18T15:21Z,Turn your speakers on.
,crazyfingerz,2006-12-20T03:32Z," my speakers are on, im not an idiot. i have sound on every other movie, but not this one. and for the record, my computer is hooked up to home stereo speakers, if there was any sound id hear it. this just has no audio whatsoever for me"
,Stuurloos,2006-12-20T08:48Z,"Just download the AC3 codec, because without that you dont have audio for AC3 films. I had the same problem and fixed it that way

Greets from Amsterdam"
,maxgunnar,2006-12-22T03:07Z,"The frame rate is slow :(  I had the same problem when I ripped,  I didn't have enough box.  what greatly improved my rips where more mem and a seperate sound card in the pci slot.  don't forget to turn off the onboard sound.  please please please try again you almost got it"
,caughtowl,2007-01-06T23:44Z,"Yes, the frame rate is way off and thier are some bullets fireing in the second cd out of nowhere.  It was really annoying"
,rodax23,2007-01-11T00:32Z,This release not nuked!!
,BinSpew,2007-01-15T12:45Z,"This is one of the weirdest rips I have ever seen.

It is good quality visually, but the audio is messed up.. I have all the right stuff installed, it's the actual audio that's messed up.

It gets slightly out of sync in places, and towards the end has music and sound from different parts of the movie playing with the current audio track..

I would recommend not downloading this copy."
,puggy,2007-01-19T00:48Z,CD2 has fucked up audio in the most important parts. Frame rate is fine on VLC for Windows.
,Gayestlord,2007-01-19T19:07Z,"This is a nuked release, the persons saying that it isn't are lying for some reason.

Maybe they are industry people? that are trying to get people to bye a copy when they find out that the pirated copy has poor quality."
,mackiain,2007-01-25T06:58Z,"I downloaded this, video seems kinda off, and there are sounds and music that happen like 10-15 minutes before they are supposed to happen in the movie."
,xxdoomxx,2007-02-27T05:47Z,Video is choppy when the camera is panning. Audio is 6ch but some channels are out of sync in spots. I recommend downloading a different rip.
,xxdoomxx,2007-02-27T05:49Z,Video is choppy when the camera is panning. Audio is 6ch but some channels are out of sync in cd2. I recommend downloading a different rip.
