,burzum83,2008-10-18T11:23Z,"yes this torrent works. the game is kind of okay.
1>download daemon tools software and install, run it.
2>when u download this torrent, you'll get two iso files as cd 1 and cd2.
3>At the right hand side of your computer monitor you will see a red icon(daemon tool) right click it and mount the cd 1, it will ask for a serial number, this is the one NLDV-7N2X-MWJ6-MMWA-ARLD 
it will extract itself and give you an option (folder) for installation. 
4>will ask for cd2 and then mount the iso2 file again using daemon tools.
5>Once installation is done, it will ask you launch the game now, u clikc yes, it won't work, cuz u have to copy the cricket game icon from crack folder to the folder where you have installed your game. It will replace the existing cricket folder and then click the game cricket icon, and there you go....sorry was in a hurry so couldn't explain properly, hope it helped..thanks"

,keralaguy,2009-12-09T23:37Z,"great work..actually i had downloaded this game 4 my elder brother, i had suffered a lot of installation problems....i am going to tell the methods of installation its very easy..
1.you need to install either poweriso or daemon software.
2. through one among the softwares simply open and mount it ( no need to make changes)
3.may be a criket ball icon appears on the virtual drive ( if not don't worry)
4.simply click on that and installation starts 
5. put serial key AAC4-JP3X-QGS6-JQGS-ARLD 
( 100 PERCEN. WORKING KEY )
6. when it asks 4 cd2 then unmount the previous created virtual drive and mount it with cd2 
7. after installation it asks 4 cd1
8. no need to put cd1 , go to the installed directory
open c:/program/easports and replace the cricket.exe file with the same file in the cracked folder
9.you can do the previous step with the help of power iso 
10.now while clicking on desktop icon it doesn't ask 4 cd1 
11. enter and enjoy.................."

11) Enjoy"
