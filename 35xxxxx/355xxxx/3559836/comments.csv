,Kwibbe,2006-11-18T14:27Z,I fixed it! - wrong directory.
,eminenz,2006-11-18T18:55Z,"brilliant, kwibbe, an amazing treat, thanks so much!"
,Kwibbe,2006-11-19T19:38Z,"More info:

= Two dvd's

First 1:1 excellent quality

Second dvd 9 to 4, good but not excellent

Audio 100%

Includes cover, hunderds of pages of sheetmusic, booklet.

Recorded in Amersfoort, The Netherlands, 2005

Amsterdam Baroque Orchestra and Choir

Boys Choir of Sacrements Breda

In my opinion: much better then Koopmans recording on cd for Erato

Success,

Please help. Also, after decompressing the Disc 2 file, we got one file called ""ds_store"". Do you know what it is for? Your great effort is really appreciated."
,pazuzureign,2008-03-14T23:02Z,"Nice upload, quite apreciated, thanks! Since I'm a purist, I would have left DVD 2/2 uncompressed. Like you said, quality is good but not excellent. Nevertheless, thanks again!"
,tomtykwer,2009-04-03T12:07Z,"Anyone still having the audio problem with disc 2: just choose pcm stereo in the audio menu, not DD 5.1."
