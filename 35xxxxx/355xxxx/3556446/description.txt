These guys have really badass live shows, and I highly recommend checking them out. Ticket prices are usually free to $3, so yeah.

THE SPORES came to attention with the inclusion of noted figures vocalist / bassist
MOLLY McGUIRE, having recently exited from MONDO GENERATOR and featured
on QUEENS OF THE STONE AGE\'s \'Songs For The Deaf\' and MARK LANEGAN\'s \'Bubblegum\', along with guitarist GREG Stunbunny BIRIBAUER, engineer for QUEENS OF THE STONE AGE, eARTHLINGS? and THE VINES.


Home recordings would be given new impetus by McGuire\'s sudden exit from MONDO GENERATOR and THE SPORES would duly be built up as a live band with the induction of the SOUL and ORGY credited KENNY PIERCE on drums.


Featuring a supporting cast of mutant puppets and a tantalizing array of music and performance, the act would soon make a name for itself on the Californian club circuit guesting for the likes of
EAGLES OF DEATH METAL, BRANT BJORK and MONSTERS ARE WAITING...


Between shows, recording and building THE SPORES live act into a 75 min. puppet/human extravaganza, MOLLY added sessions with FRANK BLACK (of PIXIES fame) and electro-clash artist PEACHES to her resume.


In July of 2006, THE SPORES released their first official CD \"Imagine the Future\", on SideCho Records.
