i thought it best to listen to them first, i hope there good."
,freakinsweet,2007-02-03T01:32Z,"i just gotta say, i just got home from seeing the spores and eagles of death metal, it was a fantastic evening.

i'm pretty wasted now but both bands were really amazing, i can recommend them both to everyone.

i'm gonna continue to seed this for as long as i can even though i brought the CD tonight(i brought the CD from molly herself, had a wee chat with her and got her autograph, bonus :) 

if you like progressive music check them out, as the uploader says:

these guys have really badass live shows

i'll be seeding for at least a couple of weeks.

this band are going to be huge in the alternate scene.

enjoy it, go and buy it, help the band to become what they derserve to be.

end of my strunken rambling.

cheers very very much to Zosimus and to all those who seed."
