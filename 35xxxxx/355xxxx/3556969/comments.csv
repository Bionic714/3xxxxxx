,Kedohan,2008-02-18T22:24Z,"Hello Schottis. I have a question about these episodes 1-85...I downloaded the first 1-36 ones (really loved em!) and thinking if the other 37-85 contain what happened to Rick and Cpt Lisa? 

I mean after the 36th movie it kinda says that saga is over and some story about ""Dana"" is next...do I got this all wrong or, is dana from 37th+?"
,Panandhisflute,2008-02-22T03:21Z,"To answer your question Kedohan,

Yes, the Robotech storyline episodes 37 to 60 involve Dana Sterling, the daughter of Max and Miriya (the zentraedi woman), this series is called Southern Cross. This series mentions characters from episodes 1 - 36, but only a few times, otherwise the storyline is completely separate from the first 36 episodes. However, it's still freakin awesome.

Episodes 61 to 85 is the New Generation, which is another completely different generation of people that come after the Robotech Masters. The enemy in this series are called the Invid.

The Sentinels is the next series which is happening at the same time as New Generation, however it is in a completely different dimension. There were only a few episodes that were made and combined into a Sentinels movie over a decade ago, however it didn't do well and never really got started. The Sentinels was recently remade as another movie (The Shadow Chronicles), reviving Robotech.

If you dig Robotech, go to www.palladiumbooks.com and check out the re-release they are planning for the Robotech line of Role playing books from the 80s and 90s. The books are tons of fun to read even if you don't play.

Happy Hunting."
,Panandhisflute,2008-02-22T03:25Z,"And thanks for the complete episode torrent Schottis, that made my day/week/month.

,matthewp240,2008-04-14T05:24Z,"Are these ""Xvid"" files? I'm not very computer savy and I'm curious if I can put these on a dvd and/or watch them with windows media player.

I would have downloaded them first but It's a pretty large file and I didn't want to waste my time."
,youredead,2008-06-12T17:23Z,Tack som fan. minnen! ='D
,sableline,2008-09-05T19:06Z,"Jag kan inte ladda från btmon. Kan du lägga upp den på Piratebay också.
tack på förhand."

or try VLC"

,JagVetInteVaJagHeter,2008-12-16T21:37Z,"The Macross Saga was awesome, however I think it's to bad all the other chapters in the series suck. Robotech Masters, New Generation and all of that stuff is weak compared to the Macross Saga."
,JagVetInteVaJagHeter,2008-12-16T21:41Z,"Svenska röster äger sönder crap-engelskan.
Men det är nog bara för att jag är van vid dom rösterna. Försökte glo på serien på youtube, fanns bara massa japansk skit, med engelsk dubbning av japaner. Sounds like shit. Förstörde öronen totalt."
,BangUchiha,2009-01-11T06:57Z,"Thanks schottis for the upload,

but anyone hardcore into the series or the anime knows that the robotech series was butchered with the dubbing and the storyline was chopped more.
watching this made me kinda relive the moments when i was a kid but it lacked substance. 

I suggest to anyone that values time and entertainment, to at least watch/download the Japanese version with Eng subs and sit thru the 80's audio, after watching both i realized what everyone was really talking about when this anime is a legend. 

And at the same time i saw what i had missed. When we're kids we dont care about quality and if the story made much sense, but now that we're older to do the series any justice watch the orginal the way it was intended and you'll be amazed at the difference in story and what they actually say !

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4229615/(W_B)_Macross(1-36)

but if you dont like reading stick with this version, however, trust me you'll love the story in the japanese uncut version better!

-bang"
,BangUchiha,2009-01-11T07:07Z,"i almost forgot, the other 2 series - southern cross and mospeda (masters and generation in RT) you'll need to download to complete the rest of the storyline in the japanese storylines

the reason those episodes didnt make sense in RT was becuz they messed so much of the story with the dubbing and deleting scenes, remember that was for kids on TV back then so they censored alot!

get the jap/eng sub version so you dont waste your time"
,ninja2177,2009-01-30T17:36Z,"thanks for the tip, BangUchica, i am going to download that torrent cause the english versions are always censored and i want the full origional stuff. cant wait to finish downloading and watch!"
,cooldaddyphil,2009-02-19T20:29Z,"Damn, I can't seem to get it to download, it stays stuck on 0%. Seed it, maybe it will work better i guess :("
,MoviemMRZ,2009-04-08T23:43Z,"BangUchiha, thanks alot for the info and the link to the uncut jap version of Robotech! 

Just seen it in english and will watch some episodes now.

I must agree with Schottis that the swedish voices were great!"
,nuboo,2010-10-21T02:51Z,"Schottis I have it the exact same way!
I have only seen episode 1,2 and 10 in norwegian, but the american version is in my opinion awful!
They have even changed certain things, like making the first alien killed on earth more evil-like....

I really would have loved to get the other norwegian version too :|"

BangUchia, thank you a lot!!!

,zhnxjtab8,2011-08-13T19:44Z,"That link to the subbed version doesn't bring up anything. But I'm attempting to see if the torrent here is the right thing (English subtitles, original Macross saga, all 36 episodes).
By the way, the Wikipedia article makes clear that the Macross saga is actually an independent series that was spliced together with two other independent animes and edited to make the Robotech series for American audiences."
,zhnxjtab8,2011-08-13T19:57Z,"The link to the original series in Japanese with English subs doesn't work. Must have been deleted.
