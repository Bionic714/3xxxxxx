\"The Greatest Spaceadventure since Star Wars\"

This is my favorite series of all times.

Started watching the series in Swedish (I only had the first 4 movies out of 12), but now several years later I found out that I just had to watch the remaing ones.

Now the movies are so unusual, they can\'t hardly be found dubbed into Swedish.


In ny case, the English in this series are great.. Even tough I personally think that  the swedish voices are much better!


Happy Watching.
