,JANHUBERT,2006-11-11T22:50Z,THE CUE FILES DON'T WORK TORRENTASSHOLE
,Mr_Data,2006-11-12T20:44Z,Why is it that ignorant w4nk3rs have to post up negative stuff. If you can do better make your own torrent!!!
,raretare,2006-11-13T20:59Z,its most probably your software that doesnt work properly ive not even downloaded the file but ill tell you if the cue file doesnt work then you need to use an isobuster but being very knowledgable youll already know that in saying that you should realy be more gratefull people take thier time and effort to bring your ungratefull ass torrents be a little more considerate to the fact they bother and you may get on a little better 
,hottybotty,2006-11-15T09:55Z,Do the tracks run Seperate or does it run in one long mp3?
,Bika,2006-11-18T16:42Z,"If you google cue files. you will find instruktions on how to edit them. You can edit cuefiles in notepad. The most common mistakes in my experience is that the the mp3 file name and the cue file is not the same. ex. 123.mp3 have to be 123.cue. Also if you enter the cue file you will somtimes see that the file cuefile is suposed to read from is not the same as pointed to in the cue file. 
The information is out there, just google and read..

,unabatedshagie,2006-11-26T19:16Z,"You need to rename the mp3 files from 30x-va-clubland_10_(proper)_-_www.torrentazos.com to 30x-VA-Clubland_10_(Proper).mp3

With x being the number of the disc, then you can mount or burn the discs as you normally do."
