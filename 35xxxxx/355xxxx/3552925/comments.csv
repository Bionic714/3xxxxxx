,drdewy,2006-12-30T03:56Z,I went to the folder that I downloaded this Torrent to and I can access the keygen but can't find the install for corel draw. Can you help me out.
,drdewy,2006-12-30T15:57Z,"Never mind I went to Corel's website and downloaded the trial version and just used the keygen to activate it. Thanks for the keygen and activation tool.

I am new to this can you tell me what I need to do to seed"
,notwhoiam,2007-01-14T07:48Z,"I downloaded a trial copy from corel, as suggested, but the keygen STILL requires an intallation code before it's willing to generate an activation code or to activate CorelDRAW. I'm not really sure what I'm doing wrong. I've used keygens before and usually they generate the 2nd & 3rd codes - but this one provides the 1st and then needs me to enter a 2nd before it'll generate a 3rd. So I'm confused.
Also should I install the trial using the serial number that Corel gave me when I downloaded the program or should I use the serial number generated by the keygen since that's what I'll be using to officially activate the trial anyway??

Please help thayk!!"
,physiodave,2007-02-21T21:25Z,hi guys. i couldnt get the keygen activator thing to give me the correct activation codes and stuff os i was just left of the option of continuing on the trial version. should i re-install it and try again or is there a better keygen around?
,Frnk2002,2007-02-23T08:39Z,"Just like physiodave and notwhoiam, I too could not utilize the keygen since it ask for an activation code (2nd line out of 3) that was not provided.  For those that have already fully intall this program could you please leave some feedback about this to help us out. Thanx"
,tirisotsou,2007-02-26T08:52Z,How do you use the key generator?I try to use it in order by phone but the program says that the serial number is invalid. Can you please post the right proceedure?
,guntherlee,2007-03-21T08:36Z,"To those having trouble with the key generator, here's what worked for me: Open key generator, copy paste serial no. as key in Corel Draw X3, delete the dashes from the serial number then click register by phone, here's where you'll find your installation code, type installation code into Key Generator without dashes, click Activate and activation code will appear, IMPORTANT: Do not copy paste activation code into X3. You have to type it in or else the continue button will remain greyed out. Click continue, print a copy of codes for your records, and your done :) "

,safehands601,2007-08-17T11:02Z,"maybe i do have an IQ of zero  but i fail to see where to obtain codes and install this programme correctly, i download. then get trial version. disconnect so as to bring up manual entry of serial number in. enter serial number from keygen. click phone. then i get ID number and no serial number, which i guess i am supposed to enter after ringing the corel dudes, i enter serial number from here with no dashes, click continue and it just installs, if i try and enter ID number as instalation code then activate on keygen i get an activation code but then what do i do with it? please someone who has the knowledge supply a dummies guide cos i can't get my head round this. Thanks"
,nealzx6,2007-08-30T16:23Z,I've just followed SK81's advice and it works great. Cheers
,frank_online,2007-09-03T11:43Z,"Ok, I had the same problems with all the codes, but eventually got it to work. Here's how it's done:
1. Disable internet connection
2. Install program, and use the phone option when asked. Enter serial manually. No copy/paste!
3. When install is done, open program, choose phone option again. Copy installation code into keygen and remove the dashes.
4. Generate activation code and type it manually into the activation field.
5. Press ""Continue"". It should work now.

In case you fail, reinstall and try again. Worked on 2nd install for me."

Always diconnected! Once activated you are free to go on line. The same happens to COREL 12.

,Unisol233,2007-10-26T13:56Z,Hey guys I understand what to do with the activation code and serial number but corel keeps asking for a Key. Does anyone know where im going wrong?
,icubyx,2007-11-20T10:56Z,"Hi all,
Here are more detailed steps for activation with appropriate warnings:
Steps to activate the program:
1. Start setup in ssg directory created after unzipping the files
2. When the program asks for trial serial, start keygen and enter the serial under field ""already have trial serial""
3. DO NOT close or regenerate the serial in keygen.
4. Start program after installation
5. Click on ""Enter activation"" - do not click ""buy""
6. When program asks for key, enter the serial earlier entered
7. In the keygen enter the number generated by Corel as installation code
8. Click Activate (DO NOT click generate)
9. Enter the activation code manually
10. Click on Continue

If you messed up any of the steps - especially closing the keygen or pressing generate again in the middle of the process, you need to reinstall the whole program. The Serial, Installation and Activation code are somehow related and change in any of these will mess up the process

Cheers!"
