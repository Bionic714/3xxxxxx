The Real Group

It always seems much too long between releases of the legendary Real Group, arguably one of the finest a cappella groups of all time and of course one of Primarily A Cappella's best selling artists. "Stamning" is a gem, leaning more towards the choral side of this three-man, two-woman Swedish group. This is their first CD under the direction of Eric Ericson, well-known Swedish director, who first worked with them when they where members of his acclaimed Swedish Radio Choir years before. The twenty two songs are a tribute to the great Swedish composers, featuring a wide selection of folk, religious and traditional songs. With a long and well respected history of vocal harmony singing Sweden has, over the years, produced many great composers and this recording features some of the best of them all. Touching, hauntingly beautiful songs with polished, perfectly blended harmonies sung by the most beautiful of ensembles. Amazing!
