             When a CIA operation to purchase classified Russian 
             documents is blown by a rival agent--who then shows up 
             in the sleepy seaside village where Bourne (Damon)and 
             Marie (Potente) have been living under assumed names--
             the pair collapse their lives and head out. Bourne, 
             who promised retaliation should anyone from his former 
             life attempt contact, is forced to once again take up 
             his life as a trained assassin to survive.
