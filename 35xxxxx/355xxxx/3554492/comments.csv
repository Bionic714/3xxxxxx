Thanks for the great share."

,Zoracic,2007-08-19T07:45Z,"If ripping subs, for those wanting the film in English with ONLY English subtitles on the Russian parts the 3rd English subtitles (smallest file 0.35mb I think) is the correct file. In DVDShrink you can make it the default subtitle or force it with IFOEdit (http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&q=ifoedit&btnG=Google+Search&meta=)

Even though I did that some of my PC playback apps didn't like it but the DVD works fine on the 3 DVD players I tried."

,Candide78,2008-05-19T19:21Z,Hi. Why are there several different file sizes for this movie? Is the movie resolution better for the 4.41GB compared to the more common 700MB file size?
