,maxigawa,2006-11-07T21:00Z,"anyone help ? 
on my mates x-box an error code comes up ""your xbox needs servicing etc"" the code on the left is 16 .
the xbox has been modded.
i have done some research and found out the clock may not be set correctly-- or maybe he has fiddled with something --
anyway i downloaded this slayers 2.7 .and burned the iso to dvd at a low speed and tryed to boot the xbox but the error keeps coming up.
error 16 (top left) and the light on the front flashes green then red on and off.
so basically how do i reset the xbox?
as it won't load anything -with or without a disk in,
thanks in advance!
i don't fancy phoning microsoft
maybe i should buy a new hard drive for it?"
,maxigawa,2006-11-11T08:56Z,"hey jroc 26 ,any chance of giving me detailed instructions on how to fix that error 16 code please ? i will download that on your link . do i need a xbox to pc lead ? i will pm my email address to you"
,maxigawa,2006-11-14T10:20Z,"hello i tryed that mazzon and as with all the other software my xbox will not boot same error 16.
i need to use pc to xbox lead a presume ?
do i need to dissconnect the dvd drive in my xbox to unlock the xbox harddrive?"
,F3Z,2006-11-28T22:48Z,"To get rid of the ""your xbox needs servicing etc""  error message you need to make sure the chip is enable (Remember 2.7 is not designed for soft modding) then from the main Evox boot screen lock the hard drive. Then you will be able to use the xbox without the chip enabled."

,Lorand8822,2007-03-30T00:01Z,Can soemone plz tell me what do i do with the iso file?
,nuF Novak,2007-04-03T23:52Z,"No offense, but if you don't know what to do with the iso, you're likely swimming into uncharted waters. Fuck, shank me if i'm wrong...most installations of this nature tend to be a lot more complicated than people realize. 

Anyway, find a copy of nero...demos free, and pirate bay is littered with cracked full versions. (any burning program will do, I just prefer nero). Find something along the lines of ""burn image to disc""...

...I've heard xbox drives are tempermental occasionally, liking only a certain sort of burnable media...but im not sure about that...

--Hope this helps"

,iceman3099,2007-04-17T17:02Z,"so what exactly does this auto installer do, and is it as dangerous as i hear?"
,Vader-,2007-05-05T05:02Z,"This file is AWESOME. I just spent time changing all 15 of my movie,cartoon and game drives from Slayer's 2.6 to 2.7.   THIS sucker has the MC360 Dash   LOL Now all my reg. xbox drives boot to XBox 360 Cloned Screens and have SUPREMELY more variance as to the Look and feel....NEW LIFE FOR XBOX1,   LOL MS WISHES they could go back and do there XBOX 360 menues this way. 

Slayer Should be given free rain at XBOX for a month ...LOL 
Probalbly put MS-Xbox 2 years ahead of themselves.. Nice....Finest piece of software since.........dare I say it .....shhhh  windows

,Vader-,2007-05-08T02:37Z,"Having 2 modded xboxes has ran me into a funny snag, but also provided me with a fix. One xbox's disk drive reads both dvd- but not cdr??
 the other will read both formats. And although I have designed both my xboxes with removable hard drive bays wich would allow me to do up all my hard drives on one box, and just use them when I want, most people won't be set up this way.

Now first off you need to know someone with an xbox1 that reads both dvd- and cdr and is using a router to ftp to and from their xbox..@#!%@#YES I KNOW  tall order since most modders only no each other online(hmmmm but a torrent could be made).  
Second ...Remember this is for converting Xbox1 programs from cdr iso to dvd iso for use (particuliarly) with dvd read only xbox1 disk drives.
Now.....You need to be using Qwix 1.01 as your ftp client. 
Place a iso burned cdr copy of xbox1 program like this  ( slayer's 2.7) into your disk drive of the xbox.      Then open Qwix, go to  Create ISO on the left. Select FTP Folder ( thats connecting to your modded xbox) and choose Drive (D).[Qwix will now make a File type ISO in the DVD format] 
Lastly Select Creat ISO at the bottom , it prompts for a storage folder- 4 minuts later you have this program Slayer's 2.7 on DVD-(I think + works on some boxes too.  
 Now I know their are likely other ways to acheive changing iso type from CDR to DVD , lord knows the 3 programs I waisted the last 2 hrs on certainly claim they can( they can't) , but will they ever make your burner and OS hang til You decide it ain't working)-{specifically ultraiso}, and if someone knows of a way feel free to add your thoughts but I know this will be usefull to some folk and maybe someone could make a DVD ISO of this slayer's 2.7 so nobody gets left out on the most beautiful programming to date for modded xbox users."
,Vader-,2007-05-11T07:15Z,Dude I use 300 gigs and it reads them fine np what so ever and I have read that 400gigs works as well.  Now I must say however until this drive # 16 all my others have been Maxtor. I remember reading that they responded best.
,clayman___,2007-06-25T20:43Z,Works just fine! :D Can someone tell me how to copy games to the hdd ? :)
,Vader-,2007-07-03T20:34Z,"Use the FTP Client known as Qwix , version is 1.1 I think....Real easy to use never failed on over 350 games for me. You can also use Qwix to make iso's of games on the xbox drive -back to the P.C. to burn copies later. ALso the modded Xbox is a great DVD ripper so once you've droped the DVD on the Xbox drive you can use Qwix to create an iso back to the P.C. and you now have the Image of your DVD on Your P.C...sweeeet"

,maciver6969,2008-01-12T19:45Z,Whats the damn passowrd the website is now gone...
,maciver6969,2008-01-12T20:02Z,Password is sevx2.7
,Shmup,2008-03-22T18:34Z,"Hm, this is odd.

I've even downloaded it twice, but I'm not sure what the problem is. I download, and then unpack the exe using the password. Everything goes fine.

Some how though, the ISO is either ""an uknown format or damaged."" At least that's what it's saying.

It's evident that others aren't experiencing this, so how crazy.."
,timelord71,2008-03-23T15:23Z,the iso is not damaged you just need to burn it with any iso burning proggy i am Timelord i use to be on the slayers team on irc there is nothing wrong with the iso just burn to compatible media that will read in your xbox drive and your good to go
,Vader-,2008-04-12T02:49Z,IMO--Your better off with AID 4.2-That's Auto Installer Delux 4.2 over this old slayers 2.7.
,unrar,2008-06-04T03:28Z,"error code 16 is a dashboard error. is your xbox soft-modded? i'm pretty sure it is from your description of the problem. this disc may well work to fix your problem, but only if your xbox's dvd drive wants to read the media. try burning the iso to a dvd. most xbox drives can read burnt dvd media without a problem. if your xbox still will not boot the media, your only other option is to use a modchip. it doesn't need to be permanently chipped, only long enough to boot this disc and restore the xbox's drive to factory settings. the modchip can then be removed and the xbox can be re-modded. "
,tilen992,2008-08-13T00:16Z,Is this for the xbox 360 or the old xbox?
,Vader--,2008-08-20T20:20Z,its for the old xbox 1
,Vader--,2008-09-27T17:08Z,"People...,
 This is so old it's like going back to windows 98.
Do yourself and others a favour and stop using it.
Go get   AID 4.3   from june 2008, it has everything and much more than this OLD Slayers.
If further explanation is needed then you need to sell your modded box to somebody else!!!"

What does it do?"

do you have een doenload link?"
,J4Y,2009-01-20T09:02Z,"hi, i have tryed everything but my xbox doesn't recognize the installer on dvd or cd, how did you guys burned this ?
I used nero 8 to burn the image."
,superj1977,2009-11-18T20:32Z,"Pile of shit can NOT be burnt to disc under win 7,tried 2 diffrent programs,several discs,diffrent brands and laptop aswell.
FukinG WANK take this off immediately!!!!!!!!!!

People you been warned!! 
Dont waste your bandwidth here with this trash!!"
,Landmouse,2009-12-20T03:08Z,"This is a working, valid .iso, however you will need a program like Craxtion or Quix to open, read, or burn a disc.  The reason for this is that the files on this .iso are XBOX files, and Windows cannot read them.  You will also need an already-modded XBOX for this to work.  For more information, visit the forums at xbox-scene(dot)com."
,Vader--,2010-02-09T07:02Z,"@superj1977
 You are wrong , Listen to Landmouse. "
,rasher78,2012-04-07T21:57Z,"superj1977 is a numpty. There's nothing wrong with this file. The only thing that is preventing people from getting this installer to work is their lack of patience, intelligence, experience and competence.

Unpack the .rar, it will reveal an .iso file. This is an image file. You need to burn this with Nero or some other CD burning app. Burn to DVD or CD that is compatible with your Xbox disc drive. Check model number. Make sure your Xbox has a mod chip and not soft modded. The disc will boot up automatically, then follow the instructions. Or better yet read the instructions in the pdf file. You need to install adobe reader to read that file.

easy."
