This is my first one of these - hope it\\\'s all OK.

This is a recording of the complete week 10 NFL Sunday Night game Chicago Bears at NY Giants.

It is from the UK\\\'s Channel 5.  There are no adverts, but there is the occasional overlap of the \\\'five\\\' commentary team of Martin Bayfield and Mike Carlson, lead by the excellent Mr Carlson.  I find it very worthwhile to listen to Carlson, but in this case, I\\\'ve removed the commentary, assuming that die-hard fans of the NFL won\\\'t want to watch him.

The 2 files contain the first and second halves of the game in DivX AVI format.  The audio format is MPEG Layer-3 at 191 kbps and the video DivX codec with a data rate of 267 kbps and a sample rate of 24 bit.

The files were recorded from the UK\\\'s digital signal straight to my Archos AV380.  After recording I edited the files on the Archos to remove unwanted stuff.
