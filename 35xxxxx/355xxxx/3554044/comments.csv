,screams,2006-11-25T07:47Z,deal with it... rar files have never caused me any problems.. i find it odd that so many people have problems with them.
,Rolex83,2007-06-10T18:40Z,"with small file(s) such as this one rar doesn't bother me, but it really sucks when someone rars a 6 gb release, which means you have to free up more than 12 gb just to unpack it
rar files make sense on DC but for torrents it's just dumb"
,Gerry_A,2007-08-30T06:37Z,"I agree, rars are stupid, ancient and seriously reduce seeding (who wants to have two copies on his hard drive, so the rar gets the boot). The only people who need them are dial-up people and lets face it, they would have to be pretty desparate to download videos, and they are a dying breed."
,Razorbladesoup,2008-02-12T02:28Z,"ITS rared because they come from newsgroups and  
they have file size limits"
,Xendor69,2008-06-25T21:54Z,"If used properly, rars should be accompacied by par filesets. Pars allow the repair of any corrupted rar files. Rar/par filesets are easy (and quick) to encode and decode and have the advantage of providing absolute data integrety."
