,FaneFlugt,2006-11-11T14:17Z,subs for this one?
,reichert,2006-11-11T15:00Z,"I saw the film, it is a very good movie, but in German language only....."
,NeedMachine,2006-11-13T02:32Z,"I haven't found any english (or preferrably swedish) subitles -- if somebody has, please let me know"
,Bendico,2006-11-13T22:09Z,"It is supposed to be in German, Reichert. If it was not in German, it would lose a lot of its authenticity - and quality.

I do not think I would be able to see this movie in English and feel as entertained. Perhaps, because I speak and understand German, I have no problem.  Although I hate when movies are synchronized from English to German, and vice versa. 

(I am from Denmark, not Germany)"
,Red_Snake,2006-11-14T20:54Z,"Of course this film should be in german spoken language, but for us who don't understand german so well it would be nice with subtitles in english (swedish is ok for me too)."

,bruno_83,2006-12-20T03:29Z,"By the way, you'll need to rename the two subtitle files into ""daw-dldaxvid1.srt"" and ""daw-dldaxvid2.srt"" respectively, so as to make them auto-load upon play; --especially in regards of standalone set-top players.."
,bearsooner,2007-04-01T12:13Z,"sehr schรถne film danke sehr, bassooner"
,taksos,2008-01-23T15:25Z,"Password, please!"
