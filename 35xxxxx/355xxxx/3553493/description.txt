\\\"For those who think they\\\'ve seen everything comes Blood Freak, a rampaging
turkey monster with a marijuana high!  Finding himself sandwiched between
Bible-thumping good-girl Angel and her bad-girl sister Ann, a musclebound
biker named Herschell falls under Ann\\\'s seductive spell when she offers him
some weed.  Quickly becoming a writhing, spastic addict - \\\"I have a feeling
I\\\'m hooked!\\\" - the big galoot then gets a job at a turkey farm where he\\\'s
fed meat with an experimental drug, and like any junkie who eats tainted
turkey meat, turns into a man with a giant turkey head.  Yes, a man with a
giant turkey head.  Who also gobbles like a big dumb bird.  Still hungry for
a fix, Herschell-the-Turkey-Man proceeds to attack fellow drug addicts whose
blood he drinks with his pointy little turkey beak.  In one magical moment,
he even buzz-saws the leg off a pusher who holds his stump and howls for
what seems like days.  All of which is punctuated by philosophical pondering
by co-director Brad Grinter before two potheads with a machete decide to go
on their version of a turkey shoot.  Wow.  A monster movie unlike any other,
Blood Freak is a jaw-dropping almost-legendary milestone in crackpot
filmmaking, and the ultimate cinematic turkey.\\\"
