New tune from Evanescence. A friend of mine (she\'s an Evanescence freak)told me this song was only available through iTunes so far, and it\'s not featured on the \"Open Door\" album. It will however, be on the next single \"Lithium\" which is soon to be released. Guess better copies than 128 kbps will be floating around pretty soon ;)

Since it\'s very calm and played on acoustic piano with Amy singing, it sounds pretty good in 128 kbps anyway.

Enjoy!
