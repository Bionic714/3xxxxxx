,ArnWe,2007-12-20T20:37Z,"i had the same problem. The intro movie didn't work. I solved it by just deleting the movie in the install direktory. The the game started without playing the intro, and everyting worked. :)"
,Tygerxxx,2008-01-20T20:34Z,"Great upload :) got it working in seconds. 

Just unpack cossacks folder, install it, then when you run it it will probably say it requires a cd ...

Open up this torrent or wherever it is saved, and it should have a folder saying !Crack 

In this is a file called  DMCR - Copy this, then open up C:wherever cossacks is installed,
(my computer -> c: -> Program files -> cossacks ) you should paste it in here :D ... It will ask to overwrite the old one ... Accept, Bingo, launch and play :) 

Hope that helps."
