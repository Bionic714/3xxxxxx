Synopsis
Chris Cross, 25 years a cashier, has a gold watch and little else. That rainy night, he rescues delectable Kitty from her abusive boyfriend Johnny. Smitten, amateur painter Chris lets Kitty think he\'s a wealthy artist. At Johnny\'s urging, she lets Chris establish her in an apartment (with his shrewish wife\'s money). There, Chris paints masterpieces; but Johnny sells them under Kitty\'s name, with disastrous and ironic results.
