No idea what language those filenames are.  The ZIPs each contain a set of pictures, which are probably showing the uploader of this torrent and his buddies (school buddies maybe?).  He probably meant to share this torrent only with his friends but somehow thought that it's clever to upload it here for all to download.  I'm sure his buddies are very happy about this."

karácsony = Christmas
osztálykirándulás = school/class trip (tour)
Vasváris hét = week of Vasvári (name of the school perhaps)"
