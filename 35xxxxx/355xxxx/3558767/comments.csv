,strider2004,2007-01-04T11:52Z,"Hi folks, if you are looking for 34 and 35 I have them on DEMONOID and BTJUNKIE as for some reason I cannot get PB to accept uploads anymore!   I have tried contacting Admin but no one replies!   So the rest, up to #48,  will need to be on BTJUNKIE or DEMONOID.

I WILL KEEP TRYING TO UPLOAD HERE THOUGH!

All the best for 2007, Willie."
