Just an old arcade game in Mortal Kombat style, 100% working and nothing is ripped from the game, music and shit is intact. Simply unrar it to E:\\games or F:\\games or whatever, it will appear as Midway Arcade Treasures, but you can easily change the name in XBMC. Sadly im no photoshop head, could anybody make 3d style icon with Xbox logo and shit? Anyway, i ripped and tested it and it works flawlesly. ENJOY
