to update make sure your connected to the internet and open the mcafee security center either in your tray or in all programs once youve opend it  it should open on my security center click on update at the side of my anitvirus index.now a window should pop up and it will connect to the internet then it will ask if you want to update click on update.now internet explorer will open and you will be asked to supply your email address and password which u gave on intallation make sure you have pop-ups turned off.click update a window will pop up and your download will start once downloaded you will need to restart your pc.on restart the updates will now install once installed you will need to restart your pc again.updates now complete.
