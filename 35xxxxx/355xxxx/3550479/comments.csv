,BrillOttO,2006-11-14T19:07Z,"look.... its like this, the game is quite coool, ive played it before and u shoot down the buggies and everything but the thing is that u are almost alone against them, thats the bad thing, the other bad thing is that the uploader has included the unpacked stuff so the amount of gb doubles up... 

just do not include that in ur doenload which u can choose when it opens in ur client... have a nice day :)"
,Dealman,2007-03-14T19:21Z,"It's not bad that its you against like 100-300 bugs. Its a easy game... Its like halo but with better graphic i mean if you get damage just keep distance for your ""shield"" to regenerate. But im not one of those i wanna rush instead. And i have a problem... My screen is whole white i can see a little - someone knows how to fix this? I got a brand new computer with latest choksan doksan for my graphic card and i pass recommended on www.srtest.com"

,Duncan05,2010-06-08T15:19Z,"Starship Troopers  - to all having the black screen issue with ATI HD cards, visit this link:

http://forums.amd.com/game/messageview.cfm?catid=227&threadid=96638

To make the blackgrey screen dissapear and when u get attacked u wont see sh*T!

These are the settings you need change in the ""global"" setting file to make it all work fine! My Documents\Empire interactive\SST\Settings open up global.settings and these settings below:

PostProcessing: { ""0"" }
Distort: { ""0"" }
DisableSM2: { ""0"" }

Shader Quality (in the game options menu, at most) : MEDIUM
everything else in the ""graphigs menu"" can be set to any thing u want as long u change these things in the ""global"" file! =)

Check out other posts in this forum but this one solved all of my problems
Thanks a lot to noob007 for this post!"
