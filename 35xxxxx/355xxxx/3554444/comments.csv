Movie quality was good tho"
,dorkfromork,2006-11-15T16:21Z,"This movie was really bad. Instead of delivering on what looked to be a promising heart felt comedy on teen gay love, it perverts the whole thing and at times makes me want to barf. Quality was great though."
,bbn,2006-11-29T16:35Z,"lol, if you hate faggots: why download this movie then? i dont get the point"
,inethero,2007-02-03T23:58Z,"B4gg3N, hahaha.

You say you hate faggots and you download a ""gay movie"". Omg.

Can someone seed plz?"
