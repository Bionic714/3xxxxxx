,Gestalt,2006-11-17T13:22Z,"lossless formats rules, noob."
,Woodenhead,2006-11-17T15:48Z,"Nothing beats flac for sound quality, especially not mp3. I only download (and upload) flac. However, I convert everything to mp3 once I download it. I got tired of getting sub-par mp3 rips all the time. (128 kb/s doesn't cut it on my audio sytem - it's 320 or nothing) Flac's quality is the same as the original audio CD. To convert it, I use MediaCoder, which is freeware. (as in, totally free) It can convert anything to anything, at whatever bitrate, frequency, etc. you want. And even an uninformed n00b such as yourself could figure it out. Maybe. "
,gobbo13,2006-11-18T17:35Z,ahhhh Lossless! Lovely :) Thanks 
,vinylking,2006-11-21T23:22Z,It's mp3 that sucks! Flac is wonderful! Thanks for the upload!
,pmpsoftcore,2007-01-20T17:31Z,I might not be the most technical freak out there so I hope I can convert this to mp3.. But THANKS Woodenhead for this. Mercury Rev were(?) fantastic. Lego my ego!
,VirreSlavo,2007-01-26T12:10Z,Anyone has the movie sountrack Hello Blackbird by Mercury Rev? I'd be grateful if somebody could upload it.
,Snurrejev,2007-08-29T22:11Z,"Oktan: MP3 sucks so hard it can easily suck a football through a garden hose (hehe). FLAC doesn't suck at all! It just gives you the same quality audio as the CD... Sure, 320kbit MP3 isn't that bad, but the usual low quality rips sure does suck."
,OBx2,2008-12-26T14:01Z,"Woodenhead, thanks for the heads-up on MediaCoder. Great software."
,gorejuice,2011-08-12T12:58Z,"Great D/L thanks. For the record however. FLAC is about half the quality of the original CD. AIFF & WAV are TRUE lossless formats. Thanks for listening! Format. 	Average of encoded album size (as % of Wave size).
Wave 	100%
FLAC 	66.57%
Monkey's Audio 	63.86%
MP3 	18.20%
Ogg Vorbis 	17.60%"
,Kwitcher,2011-12-10T23:32Z,"gorejuice - you're wrong. Lossless = lossless. There isn't any lossless codec that is ""more lossless"" than another. If you take (using your example) AIFF or WAV, do a checksum, properly convert to flac, then convert the flac back to AIFF or WAV, and take another checksum, you'll get the exact same checksum. Because they're exactly the same in quality. No data is added or lost. Hence lossless. It's like zipping a text file. lol"
