,Dark-Alex,2007-04-06T02:10Z,"In Yuri's Revenge...

There MUST be a way to generate a VALID key that works ONLINE... I have a keygen called EA Games Multi Keygen, and I USED to be able to get online and play games perfectly with that. (Required a re-install every time with the generated key.. if you've gotten banned or something and wanted to get online again, you could just re-install the game and enter the generated key from the keygen and it worked fine) But, now that's not working anymore.

Anyone know? Seriously, if anyone know a way that works (as of NOW), then write it here."
,_Whoopy_,2007-04-12T20:56Z,"hmmm i havent tried to use it to play online because i have the game itself and dont get banned ^_^, but yes if u have a nice keygen for that, put it here. ^_^"
