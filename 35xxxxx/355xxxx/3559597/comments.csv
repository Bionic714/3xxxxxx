,IonUall,2006-11-19T18:48Z,Your Welcome mrfritte
,Dezsike,2006-11-26T20:23Z,"With the videos 1-21 fits on a DVD for me. I'll download it and check your custom stuff (and seed), but next time you should not remove the videos. I re-record them to complete my collection (S1 done, S2 and S3 almost, 2-3 eps missing), if anybody have eps i don't have and will FTP me i can torrent the complete seasons."
,Mamsen2,2006-11-27T13:18Z,Thank you very much! My daughter will be so happy now. A big hug to you.
,IonUall,2006-12-02T10:28Z,I removed the videos to save space. All the versions on the disk came from here so you sould be able to find them and then select to download just the videos. I you let me know which ones you hant I will look to see if I have them.
,Dezsike,2006-12-03T11:05Z,"I have them all since all Click and Create are available here, just query 'Dora' and you will find them (but you probally know it). I used my strong CPU to re-record the videos to avi files since nothing decode them but the player came with the disk. I re-recorded the ones are not available on torrents, GNutella and eD2K networks to complete my collection."
