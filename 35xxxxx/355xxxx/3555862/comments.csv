WMV or Divx???
looking for input"
,efneho,2006-11-13T02:55Z,"First of all, thanks for sharing!

To answer your question, definitely not WMV, but preferably not strange codecs like last weeks ep. I ended up having to rip the audio, guestimate the proper speed and pitch in cakewalk, then sync it back up to the video in virtualdub, because I couldn't find an easier way of correcting it."
,osc1882,2006-11-13T09:05Z,"Dude some of the aqua teen wmv's lately... I opened them in VLC and it tried to play it in 3 different play windows. So then I played it thru Media Player Classic and it worked.

But over all I hate WMV's and I think it's save to say that most pirates do to. I could be wrong. There's quite a few great codecs for AVI, Xvid comes to mind."
,ajames17,2006-11-14T06:08Z,Divx
,killalltheyuppies,2006-11-14T23:53Z,"As I saw last week, MANY PEOPLE are having problems viewing properly when I use DivX 6.2 and up.  I have also seen problems when using mp3 audio with the file.
so....
From now on all of my releases will be latest XVID PCM.
And will be viewable by all."
,efneho,2006-11-17T07:41Z,Thankyou muchly!
,armanix,2006-11-18T08:26Z,i believe this is ep 62.  thanks for sharing though
,efneho,2006-11-20T22:52Z,Yeah. Shouldn't ep 63 actually have aired by now?
,killalltheyuppies,2006-12-02T22:08Z,"I release them with the number THE FIX gives the eps not adult swim, and trust me, the guys at the fix don't know what the fuck they are doing.  I havn't even been able to get the fix to let me download the new ones yet, this is bullshit.  Go complain at the fix  www.adultswim.com/adultswimfix "
,armanix,2006-12-05T06:26Z,"i found ep 64 at isohunt, question is, where's the real ep 63?  is there any torrent site that dedicates to adultswim shows?"
