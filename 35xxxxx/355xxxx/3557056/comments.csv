,UFOelectric,2006-11-14T06:13Z,"I found out about this game on a website searching for games similar to Diablo.

Turns out a google search link only was refering to Titan Quest being similar to Diablo but Legend Of Ares was mentioned on the page as well saying its more action and less RPG, meaning no villages to buy/sell, just gives you points to build up.  Says it came out this year 2006. 

I found out about this game on 11-14-06, and searched right away on piratebay and ironically enough this torrent was posted the same day as well.  :P

Heres the link to the review I found, it also has other RPG's reviewed like Titan Quest etc....
