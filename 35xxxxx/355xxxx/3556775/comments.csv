I was just wondering that if this is the official version of Office 2007 because I don't think Microsoft has released the official version yet and the release date is 30th November with Windows Vista. "
,Glud,2006-11-15T16:03Z,"Reply to cheeky89:
You can find Windows Vista here on The Piratebay if you want? These version are just leakes (don't know how the hacker-guys get these versions from Microsoft)."

,dsrs,2006-11-18T15:32Z,"1. mitch71h is a cunt. his spam takes you to a porn site with link to official ms trial version, which does not allow you to save any documents=totally worthless

2. this is exactly the same as wink's release

3. doser,  that is a most interesting fix for the failure to install message...which i got. but could you please explain how and why this fix works?

4. after my installation problems, which included the error message 
The windows installer service cannot update one or more protected windows 
files==
i did some searching on google groups and it appears that this release appeared briefly on the official ms volume licensing site, before it was taken down. so that is where it comes from. and a great many people found it did not install.

if it works for you, great.

,Zack018,2006-11-19T16:10Z,"Ok ppl i ve read all ur comments several times trying to find a way to install this. Well, all i got from the .rar file was a folder with more .rar files (including .bin files and all same named, and all 14649KB) and .r## files + 1 .sfv file. No .cue or any image file to mount.

I'd rly appreciate anyone writing what should i do to have Office installed.

Thank you for your time. :)"
,Zack018,2006-11-19T16:15Z,"w00t, ah well i searched the .rar files and i found a .cue on the last one. Works perfect now. Sry for the above spam. And thanks once again, gr8 torrent.

,BasicKiller,2006-11-24T08:19Z,"@ qnhon
Torrent file that you will get from the download link (at top of the page), just contains some information not the actual office2007 installation
First of all you need to install any Bit Torrent Client 
I prefer Azureus, its really good (if u have good amount of Ram in ur system) or u may use uTorrent (its lite on resources)
After you install open the downloaded torrent file with Azureus or uTorrent
Your downloading will begin soon
Good luck"

,SpoinkK,2006-11-26T06:14Z,"Okay, The difference between this one and the other one with the wink at the end is that the other one has no spell check and its sorta messed up... This one is awesome if you know how to install it properly, Its simple... Extract the 600 meg file(ultimatezip,etc.)...Extract one of those little 15 megs files(Winrar,etc) and just use Alcohol 120% to mount it and install the software putting Either the Cd-key provided -KGFVY-7733B-8WCK9-KTG64-BC7D8 or just do what i did and find one urself on the internet..when in word if it works change it to English, Canada or wherever you are...It'll do everything else : )"
