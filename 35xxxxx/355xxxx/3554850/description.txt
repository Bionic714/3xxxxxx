Asia is an arena rock/progressive rock group. It was formed in 1981 as a supergroup, with former members of Yes, King Crimson, Emerson Lake and Palmer, and The Buggles.

The comeback album, Aqua (1992) seemed to feature Steve Howe and Carl Palmer, as stated in the booklet. But Palmer did not record for Aqua. All the drum sounds were re-recorded from previous works. They merely did this to credit Palmer and made it seem as if three of the original members were still around. His picture in the album was not even a studio picture like the rest of the band (including Howe), it was taken and enlarged from an ELP promotional photo.[citation needed]. Steve Howe made minimal contributions to Aqua. Downes' environmentalist single "Who Will Stop The Rain?" attracted some radio attention, but the "Aqua" club tour featuring Howe (whose presence was heavily promoted) was well received by most of the band's supporters, with Howe taking the stage after the 5th Song. However, the tour was successful enough to warrant the band's continuation.
