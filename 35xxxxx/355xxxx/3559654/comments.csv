,kangawallafox,2006-11-18T06:58Z,How do i add them to msn??
,yukimura0224,2006-11-18T08:07Z,"logon to your msn. go to ""tools."" choose ""my msn smilyes"" or something like that. then click on the option at top right corner... or with short-cut command (C). Sorry i had msn in different language. i think the rest of the steps are quite self-explanatory, as long as u know where your bt downloads are. good luck."
