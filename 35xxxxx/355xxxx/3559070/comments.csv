[T],DasBot,2006-11-17T19:41Z,He has probably also encoded it to another format like XviD or DivX => wrong category
,uraphake,2006-11-18T14:49Z,This is a *cam* version - in which the bottom of the screen is not visible and you miss a lot of what is going on. If you like to listen to people eating popcorn and crumpling candy wrappers then you will love this. Don't waste your time on this.

You will be glad you did."
