If you want to see the 101 to 200th song list of past years, please post a comment to Richard Kingsmill's (The station manager and an announcer) blog where he lists the 101 to 200 songs:

I have got the ball rolling with my comment. I also would like to see him publish the entire list so we know exactly where our favourites ended up."
