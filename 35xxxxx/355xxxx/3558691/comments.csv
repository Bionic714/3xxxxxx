,zeinabqureshi,2008-03-24T20:37Z,"It's an MPEG file...so it's probably taken from a VCD. 352x288@25 fps, and 100 min long... 
Thanks for the share..."

However in all fairness, it may be said that the quality of the movie is very bad. It is made obvious from the first frame itself, when the title and cast starts. The cast is seen cut off from both sides. You can only read half names. This shows that the movie was probably shot by someone with a shoddy camera within a cinema hall.
I am a great fan of this movie and downloaded it because I wanted to see it again and again. But after three days of downloading, I am seriously thinking of deleting the movie. Because seeing it is such a pain."
