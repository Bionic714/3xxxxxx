Ripped in Exact Audio Copy with Secure Mode to Musepack .MPC audio.

MPC settings:

--quality 7 (also known as Insane)

About MPC:

MPC (aka Musepack) is far superior to MP3 in terms of quality and compression.

--quality 7 gives better files than MP3s encoded with LAME with the -V 0 --vbr-new switch, while maintaining approximately the same filesize.

And many times, MPC audio at even lower quality than 7, or Insane, sounds better than MP3 would at 320-CBR. MPC is pure VBR and is designed to be as transparent as possible. 

----------------

Winamp users:

Copy in_mpc.dll to the Winamp plugins folder, then restart Winamp.

Make sure you NEVER have the equalizer on when playing MPC!
It will mess up the sound, so make sure it\'s OFF!
