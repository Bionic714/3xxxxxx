And please keep the .zip files after the extraction is complete, that way the torrent won't break apart, and other people will be able to download it from you."
,Osaka,2006-12-13T03:47Z,"I'm currently seeding this: http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3575057/

So I won't have any time to seed anything else, including the Final Fantasy soundtracks (or the Silent Hill OSTs for that matter) for some time now.

Please seed all the FF soundtracks after you've downloaded them for at least a few days, or weeks even if you can."
,dbsanfte,2007-04-17T11:04Z,Why are you .zipping already-compressed digital audio? Imbeciles. Who is going to keep a hugeass .zip on their drive in perpetua? Just .torrent the music files for crying out loud.
,Osaka,2007-04-30T13:33Z,"dbsanfte, you don't seem to understand much... and you don't seem to have much experience with making torrents either.

The reason I zipped it is NOT to compress it further (duh), but rather just BECAUSE I made a torrent of it... 

If you don't zip it, most people will just download all the songs then MOVE the files to another location (such as their music folder), thus rendering the torrent un-seedable from their side.

A zip will remain and when they unpack the files they can move them around how much they want and still be able to seed and share back.

This is a proven FACT. 

You're free to have whatever OPINION you want about it, but that won't change the facts, sorry."
,Amarth41269,2007-05-31T21:07Z,"The fact is that it takes twice the space on hard drive your way, and I, and other ppl dont like it. And many ppl just delete your zip and moves the files elsewhere. How clever is that?"

,ClassicsGuy,2007-08-28T03:22Z,"All he's saying is that you can unzip and enjoy the files while you are seeding it to other people without interruption.  
Sure it takes up a little more hard drive but think of other people.  
While I personally do not enjoy zip files too much either I understand why he's doing this and I want you guys to understand as well."
,cheLLfish,2007-08-29T09:25Z,"Yeah, thanks ClassicsGuy.

I uploaded some Silent Hill soundtracks, and they were not zipped... guess what, almost no one seeds them anymore. 

I had to constantly go back and seed because people either moved the files or modified them in some way. I've given up on seeding them now though.

I found the SH2 OST in lossless (FLAC), I might put it up in a few days or the coming week...

Oh yeah, the reason I didn't .zip the FFX and FF9 Lossless soundtracks is because both those torrents are rather big (1,42 GB each) and also pretty rare hard-to-find stuff (especially the FF9 OST)... 

It's unlikely that some clueless noob who has no idea what FLAC or lossless even means will just grab a 1,42 GB torrent and not seed.

What I mean is, most people who download stuff like that already have an understanding that it's good if they seed a lot.

So that's why they're not zipped, just in case anyone wonders."
,Osaka,2007-08-29T09:32Z,"Aw, heck!! LoL!

Yeah, that's me, actually...

Another username was already logged in... forgot to check that. Sorry for the confusion."
,Elvorn,2008-04-16T14:50Z,"I'm having a bit of trouble getting them to play. I've installed the plug in to its correct location but I'm not sure how to turn the equalizer off entirely rather than just hide it, can anyone help? 

Thx"
,Elvorn,2008-04-16T14:52Z,"My bad I got it, I was just having a retarded moment"
,eb88,2009-02-14T22:04Z,Damn that quality is blowing my mind! Do you have any other final fantasy ost's in this mpc format?
,eb88,2009-02-14T22:10Z,I have to convert this to put on my iPod nano right? So the quality would go down?
,lockydudeman,2010-01-30T05:23Z,I'm definitley gonna seed the heck outta this! thanks for the upload osaka!
,lockydudeman,2010-01-31T13:50Z,"question, how do i convert these to mp3, without them turning into crackling shit? im still gonna seed(i am now) but i wanna put these on my music player, and it doesnt play mpc"
,zarnaik,2010-12-19T20:06Z,"Sounds great, but i'm only at a 1% download after 15 minutes :((

,zarnaik,2010-12-19T22:40Z,"Update, speed improved a little and after aprox 2.5 hrs it's done!! great quality.
