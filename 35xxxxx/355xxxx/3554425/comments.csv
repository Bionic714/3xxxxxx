,thebc,2007-02-21T20:59Z,"thanks kb....... question on step 3, how do i get my ""computer name"" ? could it be hppav.domain_not_set.invalid ? .. when i click to install Pro/E, there's already a FLEXnet License Server listed, 7788@hppav. do i still need to click 'add' and choose 'single serv lic' ? if so, then how do i know my 'comp name' ? cheers "
,kissboll,2007-02-27T21:52Z,"thebc: to find your computer name. right click on your computer on the desktop. and click on the ""computer name"" tab (or similar).

I don't know if this is it. (It was about a year a go I installed it and I don't use it any more).

There is also supposed to say something vital for the installation in on corner of the installation window. I remember i missed it at first. So check  in the corners of the installation window.

good luck

'The following warning conditions arose during installation. These are informational warnings only:
Startup License Server
License Management was succesfuly installed but could not be started. Refer to the logfile
""C:\Program Files\flexnet\licensing\ptclmgrd.log""
for details and error messages.'

,kissboll,2007-09-13T16:50Z,"Sorry, i dont use vista so im not familiar with the OS.

and it was a year or so back i installed this so i dont remember shit how i did it... but i do recall having the same trouble. make sure you read the info carefully and that you've entered all the numbers right. dont forget your computer name thing in the bottom right corner...

im sorry to tell that om not even seeding it anymore (sorry). It was deleted when my harddrive crashed. Stupid thing.

Well, so its up the the rest of the piracy community to seed this and help you out.
if anyone got the same problem please leave a comment here."
