,norplay,2006-11-05T18:47Z,"If you don't know what FTP is, use a SEARCH ENGINE like GOOGLE. You find answer there, not here!"
,XazteR,2006-11-06T17:40Z,"I have tried this one.

It works.
simple.

but, i can only use this program to make a server in the Local Area Network, not out of the house."
,vankis,2006-11-07T13:52Z,Does it really take a genius to understand that it's a good idea to write what version the software is?
,pwingo,2008-11-03T04:25Z,"lol, it works, ftp is file transfer protocol, you can access files on your pc from other pc's
