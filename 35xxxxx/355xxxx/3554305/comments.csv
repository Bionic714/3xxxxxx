Can you give any info on quality , screen size etc ?

,wankan,2006-11-10T12:20Z,"If any one is interested there is a divx version of this at http://search.utorrent.com/search.php?q=song%20of%20the%20south&e=http%3a%2f%2fisohunt%2ecom%2ftorrents%2ephp%3fext%3d%26op%3dand%26ihq%3d&u=1

673mb . The torrent has been alive for 41 weeks so  hopefully is okay ."
,radar9999,2006-11-10T17:26Z,Can anyone else seed this for a few weeks. At this rate It'll take a month or more to download.

I downloaded it today from the above site and put it on thePiratebay . 300+ seeders ."
,ppaannzzeerr,2006-11-14T07:04Z,Super DivX it the one from FFMPEG and SUPER only encodes in Plain Simple Profile.  Not as good of quality.  (The connection keeps being shut off from all internet activity because someone is constantly trying to break in.)
,BlackDahlia,2006-11-14T07:21Z,"DivX, schmivX. Get the DVD rip here http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3520925/Song_Of_The_South_-_BANNED_in_US____hi-quality_DVD_rip_ and enjoy this fine classic any time you wish with all of the extras included."
,verde.centaur,2007-11-17T06:19Z,"Great file. It is NOT A DIVX. 

It is an MPEG-1 file. This is Video CD format, the one that is a lesser version of DVD video. (lower quality).

I give this two thumbs up. It is better than the AVI file, I watched both. 

The audio is great, the video is pretty good, not excellent. It's a good preview to decide if you want to buy/acquire the full on DVD version of the film.

The colors are vibrant and it is not blocky. I would recommend this download to anyone.

It is full screen.

Hey uploader, what is your name from ?"
,LowCastle,2008-03-26T20:21Z,Plays fine.  No problems.  Thank you ppaannzzeerr!!
,gcnd0001,2008-08-02T23:13Z,How about seeding this. Im trying to download this. Im uploading 3 times faster than im downloading.
,Pagnus,2008-09-19T18:49Z,"""BANNED IN US"" Suuure.. I dont think so. It has won an Oscar and you got free speech in USA."
,Pagnus,2008-09-20T21:40Z,Worst rip ever!
,Joreth,2008-11-23T20:42Z,"No, it's not ""banned"" in the US, but Disney will not release it, and since it's a Disney movie, that means no one else can legally do so either.  So no, it's not banned by the government.  The company that owns the movie is embarassed by it and is refusing sales."
,sbraudrick,2009-01-05T00:47Z,"No, it is not banned in the US. Furthermore it is a piece of art that reflects the time in which it was released. Disney is in no way ""embarrassed"" by this work but realizes its possible inflammatory nature and has not, yet, re-released it in the US.

There are some of us that remember this film as a part of our childhood, the gleeful song ""Zipideedooda, zipidee-ay"", and remember a time when ""P.C."" wasn't even a pop-culture term. 

Those that protest these types of films should instead celebrate them as a definitive marker of how far we have come in the last 60+ years."
,r2dl,2010-02-05T14:23Z,image & sound quality extremely poor on this one....
