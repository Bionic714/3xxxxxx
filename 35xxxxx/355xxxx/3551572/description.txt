Since BBC America cancelled this show, i know that a lot of you would like to see the ending. If you want more episodes, make sure to seed this for a long time. This is my first time uploading a torrent, and I won't both adding another one if no one seems to appriciate it. If you like it, comment and seed. There are 6 more episodes after this one.
