Do anyone know if there are a ""complete"" x-men torrent out there? Especilly for New X-men and Astonishing X-men."
,KhakiMan,2006-11-08T17:40Z,I could make a complete torrent for X-Men v2 if I could find issue #185
,Creops,2006-11-08T18:54Z,That would be nice :)
,profx72,2006-11-09T16:58Z,"Thanks, Mr. Khaki!  I was disappointed when I couldn't most of the files last time it was posted.  I'll keep it seeded for as long as I can.  (PS: I've got all of last year's DCP's seeded constantly.  Anyone holding Old DCP's from 2005, please seed.)

Thanks again."

I appreciate the effort you made to completing this torrent.
