This year, Clarkson has gone way out west to the United States of America to find out if there really is a decent American car! Watch the wagons roll as Clarkson has a show-down between some of the top American cars with some of the top UK and European cars! 

\"For my all new DVD I\'ve come to the U.S. of America-land to find out if the country that gave us fast food and the fast buck make a decent fast car? In fact, can they make any decent cars at all?

In my quest, I pitch the best of the West against Europe\'s finest. The Stig\'s along for the ride too as we put the BMW Z4M head to head with the mighty Dodge Viper SRT 10. And the little Lotus Exige against a tuned Mustang. 

I also put the 200mph Corvette Z06 through its paces alongside the Cadillac XLRV, the Ford GT and its topless cousin, the GT X1.

And then we find out what would happen in a car chase if a big American police cruiser were to set off in pursuit of an Ariel Atom. (This bit\'s quite short!)

There\'s science too, as I flood an old Jaguar and a Lincoln with water, tear two Buicks into little pieces, race a Mustang horse against a Mustang car and use high explosives to make my very own Star Spangled banger. Oh, and we discover what happens if you fill Toyota\'s green machine, the Prius, with a special kind of lead: bullets.\" - Jeremy Clarkson
