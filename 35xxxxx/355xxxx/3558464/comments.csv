,Apeloff,2006-12-06T22:54Z,"judec!  We would all seed this if the uploader would! If you look at the top you'd see that this file has been downloaded 0 times.

Why upload something if you have no intension of seeding?

If the uploader would get his finger out of his ass, and start seeding, then maybe he could live up to his nickname. He's no saint in my eyes :-("

,xiIix,2007-12-24T08:58Z,"Jeremy Clarkson is the most biased reviewer on the planet. That red Mustang he tested wasn't even a GT, it was an automatic V6 base model. And please, a Mustang vs. an Elise? WTF is that? The cars were built for two totally different purposes. Mustang was built for acceleration and the Elise was built for handling. That comparison was about as useful as a eunuch in a porno film.

I love Top Gear, I really, really do. It's a fantastic show and I'm hooked on it, but it gets really old seeing Clarkson do these ridiculous comparisons of cars that are in completely different price ranges and completely different areas of purpose just to make America look like a bunch of asshats. I'm sure he'll find a way to talk shit about the new ZR1 that's going to be whooping TONS of exotic ass next year, but that wouldn't surprise me."

,ChaosCenturion1282,2008-03-11T02:09Z,"Most any vehicle produced in the united states (essentially mexico) is a piece of garbage and cannot be compared to anything from overseas. Protectionist measures have prevented the evolution of the US auto industry and the importing of more European vehicles, besides the High End imports."
