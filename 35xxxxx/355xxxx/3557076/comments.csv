,Reisende Mac,2006-12-06T16:51Z,This album pretty much sums up all the best trance anthems the last years!
,Reisende Mac,2006-12-08T19:40Z,"Actually bought the album now, it's that good.. :) First cd's I've actually paid for in a couple of years, this one all thanks to the Pirate Bay.."
,Delerium_07,2007-03-26T06:30Z,"I think it should be called VA-Classic_Dance-Trance_Anthems-3CD-2006, because I don't see many trance artists. Still, it's good for the begginers who want to get into the trance-formation."
,smokie76,2007-04-18T12:24Z,"yeah, and you should be called Delerious not Delerium u muppet"
,Russian_TM,2007-10-27T11:30Z,Nice collection man!
,remedyz101,2008-11-30T18:56Z,Does the .rar file work with itunes ??
,Riste01,2009-01-17T05:30Z,"Oh this is crazy!! Thankyou!
