,LeffiLuv,2007-03-28T22:42Z,"I have many sleepless nights over this game, proves u don't  need graphics to enjoy a game"
,tooTiredtoo,2007-03-29T14:45Z,"LeffiLuv: My experience too :)

Thepawn: I sent you a message but the vesa driver issues is almost always because XP doesnt support vesa. Have you tried using the scumvare first and load it there?

If anyone else has encountered the problem and solved it, please help. I dont have the knowledge to be of much assistance here :(

,catch64,2007-05-28T13:50Z,"has anyone been able to find a way to just put this on your hard drive..? My burner went out annd Im trying to tell ""scum"" to open the game where I installed it.. alas.. any suggestions ? "
,tooTiredtoo,2007-05-28T23:48Z,"burn the .nrg file to a cd with Nero or possibly rename it to .iso and use any other burn program. The game was made for DOS, so you will probably need a prog that enables xp or vista to run a dos prog. If you choose the full instalation from the cd I seem to remember that you wont need the cd in order to run the game. you will need it to install the game however...
Help from others would be appreciated."

,lexington50,2007-10-04T06:32Z,"Well I couldn't get this game to work. 

Note that the scummvm emulator does not list Panzer General as a compatible game, and I couldn't get it to recognize the game after installing it."
,lexington50,2007-10-21T00:48Z,"chemicalneo -

Thanks for your help.

I did it just like you said, mounted the PG image with alcohol 120%, installed it, ran VDM sound to configure the sound and then run the EXE.

Only one problem remains: when I run the EXE I get the ""Failed to load @:\lib\drv\VESA480.dll"" error.

From checking Google I notice a lot of people have this problem. Some got it because they forgot to mount the image (or, if running from a CD, had the CD in the wrong drive), but I get it even with the PG image mounted in the virtual drive.

Any ideas?"
,lexington50,2007-10-21T00:52Z,"chemicalneo - 

ignore my last - I'm an idiot.

All I had to do is right click on the PG VDM Sound Shortcut icon and check the ""Enable basic VESA support"" box under Properties.

Duh!

Again, thanks for all your help!"
,NavyDude,2007-10-29T11:28Z,"come on guys please seed!! i really want this game, but i only have the DOS version of the game and it aint running well on XP, so... i saw on one comment that this is the win. 95 version and that should work :D"
,tooTiredtoo,2007-11-24T04:26Z,"Chemicalneo :)

Thanks for all your help. Been away for a while so I have not seen all your effort until now.
Its truly a great game. Shame that they didnt make PG2 and 3 as enjoyable. PG2 is quite good but PG3 is all work and no joy...."
,limace31,2008-03-18T11:57Z,"Chemicalneo - 

Same pb as lexington50: ""Failed to load @:\lib\drv\VESA480.dll"" error....even if I check the ""Enable basic VESA support"" box! "

Thanks for that - i will kepp seeding!!!

,JakilaTheHun,2008-07-02T18:00Z,"I'm having some extreme difficulty getting this to work.  Initially, I kept getting the """"Failed to load @:\lib\drv\VESA480.dll.""  I download VDM Sound.  That didn't fix the problem.  

Then, I read chemicalneo's post; I can't find the dosbox.cfg file (I only see an .exe), but I mounted everything from the DOS Box application itself.  That seemed to fix the VESA480.dll error thing - or at least, the game looks like it was about to launch and there's a brief red flash on the screen, but then the screen goes black.  I can hear the CD Rom working, but nothing seems to be happening.  

Help?"
,JakilaTheHun,2008-07-02T18:03Z,"Nevermind my last comment.  I think I got it to work.  I had to change the directory to the /pg/exe one and type ""panzer.exe"" to get it to work.  "
,RedCommie,2008-07-17T10:27Z,"Bloody Great! One of the first games I got for my 'new' 486 DX2/66 back in 1995! Hell, managed to do a 26 hr marathon game session, my all time record by far playing this! It was revolutionary at the time, great graphics, gameplay, and by far the best feature, not replicated in any game since, the branching campaign with so many possibilities and types of victory!! Panzer General II and subsequent ones missed this great idea. Only gripe was when defeating Normandy and Italy invasions. You still were pushed back by Allies when in reality such a blow would pretty much end their offensives. Thanks man!"
,RedCommie,2008-07-17T12:59Z,"@Chemicalneo

I love you and want to have your baby! GAME WORKS GREAT thanks to your instructions! Ahhh...that German Officer that gives the briefings, and the accent, the music when you start, the simple but brilliant move and attack, supply, reinforce method....So many memories! Last played it more than 12 years ago yet still remember almost every map! THAT is the sign of a BRILLIANT game! Thing is, in interface and clean graphics it still is better looking than many wargames out now!

@ tooTiredtoo

Thankyou so much for this! I still have my old DOS version in original box somewhere in a storeroom, but the Win Version never had the chance. So thankyou again.


Incidentally apart from Commander Europe at war, which mimics this game to an extent, the only other game similar to this that is out now is Fantasy Wars, itself very closely modelled on the gameplay of this, or rather it's Fantasy General derivative. Fans of that game and this one should give it a go as it really is good, though unknown."
,tooTiredtoo,2009-03-20T21:48Z,"My God!
I posted this in 2006 and still the torrent is up :)

I seem to remember a collection pack called ""5 star general"" was announced some time ago. It should contain Panzer general, Allied General, Pacific general, Fantasy general and Peoples general.

Has anyone heard any more about it?

At least Panzer general has got to be re-issued in some form sometime!?"
,DragonBice,2009-07-19T03:16Z,"I installed the sound thingy and tried to open the 'PANZER' file in the 'EXE' folder (C:\PG\EXE). The DOS window opens up and I get:

""Driver not ready error reading drive D
Retry, Ignore, Fail?_""

I can now hit R, I or F but they all do the same thing: the DOS window closes and nothing happens.      : (         ( help please... )"
,cymen,2009-09-15T01:52Z,"great game, installs and works like a charm. i've never played cd version before."
,ghostwalker747,2010-09-14T02:36Z,"tooTiredToo, go to google and type in panzer general wendy, you should come across a website with all those games mentioned"
,paloczi,2011-02-07T08:45Z,"""Failed to load @:\lib\drv\VESA480.dll"" error 

Solution:

In the Dosbox you have to mount the cd drive likewise:

mount d d:\ -t cdrom

Thanx tooTiredtoo"

It works! Thank you."
