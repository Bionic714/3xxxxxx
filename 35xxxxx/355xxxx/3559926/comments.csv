,Bluesluvr,2011-11-17T01:22Z,"I had this in CD form and the liner notes state that ""somehow Charlie Parker showed up without a Saxaphone and had to borrow some tinhorn of a Saxaphone but he made it sound like a million bucks..The original plan was for the Jazz Society and the musicians to share the profits from the recording. However, owing to a boxing prize fight between Rocky Marciano and Jersey Joe Walcott taking place simultaneouly, the audience was so small that the Society was unable to pay the musicians' fees. The musicians were all given NSF checks, and only Parker was able to actually cash his. This album is a must have, it is absolutely awesome!!"
