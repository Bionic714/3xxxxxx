UFO Enemy Unknown, or perhaps better known by the name of X-Com 1 is a strategy game where your job is to stop the alien invasion and threat to earth. You start off by building a base somewhere on the globe. You are initially given 3 crafts, 2 for intercepting airborn UFOs, and one with crew for getting rid of ground alien troops and survivors of shot-down UFOs. The base is also equipped with research, manufacture, radar, defense etc. facilities. 

Each month you get fundings from every continent. The amount of money you get depends on how well you have controlled the alien threat on a certain continent. As the game progresses, you research new weapons, either from recovered aliens and their artefacts, or just normal earth weapons. The ground combat is turn-based, but nonetheless very dynamic and interesting.
