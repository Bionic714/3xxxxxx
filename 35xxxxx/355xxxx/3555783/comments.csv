How do u install the game?

Greetzzz,
Coppenst"
,swechetter,2007-01-12T19:31Z,"oki people since many people have asked about this torrent im gonna mame it clear, this is NOT the game itself, you can see it on the size, the real game is 6.5 gigs.

this is a called crack, its for those people who have downloaded the game, but the DVD have copy protection, and the downloaded game wont work without a crack.

ok so do like this, go to your medieval war 2 install directory.
like ""C/Program/activision/medieval war 2""

now, can you see that there are alredy a file called the same thing as the crack here?
what you are going to do is to switch out the existing medieval2.exe with this one.

so, put this file in C/Programs/activision/medieval war 2
it will say like ""theres alredy a file called medieval2.exe, do you want to replace it?""
answer yes.

ok so now uve switched out the REAL medieval2.exe with THIS medieval2.exe

now you can play the game
by the way, this is how you do with other games too.
OK now you know how to crack  a game!"

,shortys240s,2010-11-29T22:53Z,"the guy who wrote that: after this downloads open it, copy the medieval 2.exe go to the folder the game is installed too, and paste, it'll give option to replace , do that and open up the new .exe from that folder, the one that may be on your desktop is not valid, id open from the folder, only way it lets me open the game"
