    Saracen empire, discover long forgotten islands, ruins and catacombs on a 
    search for a secret hidden on the ground of an ancient underwater fortress.

    that victory must be paid with blood, pain and even your very own soul...

    the Temple, which followed the epic exploits of the young templar Paul de 
    Raque in his battle against the demonic forces of Hell.
