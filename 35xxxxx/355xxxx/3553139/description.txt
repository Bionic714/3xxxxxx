Here it is: one of the most tremendous chillout albums I have ever heard!
Unfortunately, the band does not exist any more, and the CD is very, very hard to find.
The album was ripped using the FLAC (Free Lossless Audio Codec) encoder. You can use these files as perfect source material for any audio encoding (even WAV - no loss of quality!). You may not be able to play them, as FLAC is not yet very supported. If so, goto http://www.videolan.org and get the VLC Player. It will play almost everything. For the FLAC stuff goto http://www.xiph.org  - there you will find software and hints needed for transforming the stuff into your desired audio format.

Enjoy and relax. Life is too short. Do not waste it.
