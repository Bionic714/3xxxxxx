,jake3818,2007-07-10T07:33Z,does this have english subs for the french parts???
,darklittleapartmentstudio,2008-06-19T08:33Z,"nope, no subs at all.

Disappointing, that was the only reason i downloaded it- I speak more than one language, but french isn't one of them.

...I was  hoping for subs.

my other copy is just like this too-
 too bad, this is such a great film...

anybody got subs for this?  got a copy w/ subs?

UP THAT SHIT!!!"
