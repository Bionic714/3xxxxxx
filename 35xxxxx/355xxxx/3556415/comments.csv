,acjoven,2009-04-09T00:22Z,"Well, you're both right.

It is indeed the Jan. 29 show from Eugene.  The proper order of the tracks is in the first comment, while the track names of the provided tracks are in the second comment.

Solution:  Rename tracks via comment 2, then rearrange to match the order provided in comment 1.

What a show!
