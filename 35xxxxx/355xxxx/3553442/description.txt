I apologize to all the people that tried to download stuff from me before - Right after I created and posted my files, my computer died on me, and I just finished rebuilding it - From now on my torrent client will be running 24/7, so I will always be seeding - Again, I'm sorry for any inconvenience that may have caused!

Relentless Edition FAQ
======================================

*What is a 'RE' release?

 A 'Relentless Edition' game has been pre-cracked and rebuilt by 
 relentless_tech (http://www.noitats.com)


*What's so good about an 'RE'?

 All Relentless Edition releases are rebuilt to be 'install & play'
 This means no cracking, no CD-Keys needed, and most come with bonuses
 (trainers, cheats, update patches, bonus DVD's, and other extras), all 
 integrated into an easy-to-mount/install/play game!


======================================
Installation Information
======================================

Mount ISO image to Nero ImageDrive, Daemon Tools, or other virtual drive
device

Install the game, following the InstallShield prompts

Unmount image, put it away somewhere, and play the game ;-)
