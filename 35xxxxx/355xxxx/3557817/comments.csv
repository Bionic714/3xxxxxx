,metaljimmy83,2006-11-15T15:52Z,"thannk you very much demonlegion!!....

does this one work okey?"
,demonlegion,2006-11-15T17:50Z,"no virus or trojan, keygen works fine but i never fully installed the app, havent had time yet lol"
,demonlegion,2006-11-15T17:55Z,"please dont forget latest spyware is picking up keygens/patches/cracks as malware + virus.

all the above use similar programs to the virus writers...if you are unsure then dont install:)"
,tinntinn58,2006-11-16T19:44Z,is this just a demo???
[V],olingskoG,2006-11-17T16:41Z,Fantastic speed and fantastic torrent! =) Thank you!

THANKS ALLOT"
,varmekanin,2006-11-17T21:54Z,"Nero Sipps doesn't seem to be included at all, please don't upload torrents which says they are something they aren't."
,Mortuus Anima,2006-11-18T20:26Z,Seed plz. Only 2 unsatisfying kbs=(
,F3LIIX,2006-11-20T20:36Z,DEMO?
,Admiral999,2006-11-24T00:44Z,Thx mait!! 
,the evil twin,2006-11-24T09:52Z,"Works great...superfast download...no trojans...kudos demonlegion, well done."
,Ardroth,2006-11-25T20:52Z,"Yeah Hi.  Why isn't anyone answering whether this is a demo version or not?  It says it will expire in 30 days... Should I take this seriously, or DL a different version of Nero that won't expire?  Thank you."
,demonlegion,2006-11-26T21:52Z,"no it wont uninstall or fuck up after 30 days if you use the keygen properly.

by the way most demos are full programs they are just restricted from full use hence a keygen."
,demonlegion,2006-11-26T21:56Z,"sipps if this site was more user friendly, torrent descriptions could be edited do you not think??"
,kinglan,2006-11-28T05:07Z,"Got this from another site and its malware. Screwed my system up. Do not download this.

Had to go into safe mode to get rid of it along with adaware and spybot. Now my right mouse button does not work in windows explorer and cannot figure out where to enable it.

STAY AWAY FROM IT"

,asian_kaka,2006-12-27T22:53Z,"is this the latest ner premium?
if so then how somes its such a small file?"
,jarkmeister,2006-12-30T13:45Z,"go to nero's homepage and download the full trial version ( the newest )

and use the keygen to make it working :)"
,dermok,2007-01-02T21:42Z,"Cheers for this upload.  Just wondering, how come the file size is small compared to most others of this?

Thanks"
,charfordcharford,2007-01-10T14:00Z,"Good Download, Good Keygen, Good Program. Thanks. I'll seed as long as I can. "
,kc7riy,2007-01-16T16:07Z,"Kinglan, 

 Don't you scan your downloaded torrents for viruses?  If you had, you wouldn't be bitching now.

 Good download rate for my crappy connection. Good program and keygen.  "
,gamecock1,2007-01-23T02:12Z,"Hardware enforced DEP is only available (as of writing this article) to users who have machines based on the AMD Operton 32 or 64 bit processor, or the AMD Athlon 64 processor with NX (no execute page protection), or the Intel Itanium processor with XD (execute disable bit).  

BEWARE, OR AT LEAST TAKE PRECAUTION!

Got this error message for the first time ever! I have a a core2 duo, which has hardware based stop execute, why else would I get this message? "
,Martinet_12,2007-01-25T19:30Z,"This (NRB, I'm not using the extras) generally works, but crashes on exit, and produces an internal error when trying to verify a .bin burn.  A couple other glitches.

Also, I don't recall it asking me for a key.  There seems to be one in it already.

,brock100870,2009-01-28T05:17Z,"Thankyou so much.. i will seed for a month,downloaded within 4mins,installed within 3 mins..works almost perfectly on my vista home premium,did as you said,installed,used keygen..must be stupid peeps who cant do this..Anyway,the only bug (and i mean the only bug) was when i clicked on startsmart (no problem there) then clicked on make dvd to burn a movie i had downloaded (naughty naughty)..the window supposed to pop up after around 10 secs like the old one,well it didnt,for a while,well quite a while...so all you have to do do right click and maximize everytime,otherwise it wont pop up on screen..thats it...peeeezy,cheers me duck xx"
