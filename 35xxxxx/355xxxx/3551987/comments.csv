,John the Baptist,2006-11-05T21:18Z,"My first creation of this torrent was faulty due to a couple of spurious ""ghost files"" that actually weren't there. This time everything seems OK. I'm sorry for the inconvenience."
,John the Baptist,2006-11-05T22:47Z,"128. I feel that's quite adequate. If you like the music and think the bitrate is too poor, the box is only 35 ÂŁ on Amazon.co.uk and an absolute bargain."
,John the Baptist,2006-11-05T22:57Z,"Sorry - it's actually a bit more. The tracks are encoded with LAME, and the bitrate seems to vary between 180 and 240 K. I for one can't hear any artifacts, but then my ears are getting old."
,Peter0703,2006-11-05T23:57Z,"40CD's???? I only find 28 and most of them contain 2-7 titles, one even completely empty?!!! Is this a joke?"
,John the Baptist,2006-11-06T00:09Z,"As this is a file structure residing on my HD and not 40 CDs, I have been moving the tracks around to what I feel is a more 'natural' way of organization. The Mattheus Passion for instance fills 3 CDs, but I have put the lot in one directory and renumbered the tracks. The Cantatas on the other hand are grouped by three on the CDs, and I like to have one in each directory, with the proper name for each one. As for the empty dir, I'm unable to find it. Can you tell me what it's named?"
,gnome99,2006-11-06T00:27Z,"Thanks for the upload. Any opinions on the musical quality (I'm not talking about sound quality) of these particular recordings?

Peter0703: Here's a complete list of what tracks are included, you can compare with this:

,John the Baptist,2006-11-06T00:47Z,"I think the musical quality is very decent throughout. I have been listening to Bach for almost forty years from a variety of performers, and this collection is on par with anything I've heard. There will always be differences in the musical interpretation, and the personal taste will of course vary. But this is solid work from professional musicians."
,badblob,2006-11-14T14:58Z,"It appears as three of the organ chorals are broken, nos 15, 16 and 33, but thank you very much for the music"
,gbmaizol,2006-11-25T00:40Z,"Man, i feel like i owe you something good. Is there anything you want?
I have four beautiful teen sisters... :-D"
,nutriaposita,2007-12-11T12:55Z,Thank you so much for this - wonderful music and  a fast download too! 
,Johosc,2008-01-22T20:54Z,"Certainly fast, I had 1,5MByte/s download today :)

Very very nice. I'm missing some of the organ works though. Still, extraordinary upload - thank you!"
,HarebSerap,2008-02-24T00:32Z,"Hello and thanks for the upload. I've bought this package myself but one of the CD:s got scratched so I dearly wanted to replace it somehow.
Anyway, I can't seem to find the cd:s/tracks I need due to your elaborate tagging system. It was volume 13 that got scratched for me, on the back of it it says it contains ""Piano Sonata no.9 inE major OP. 14 NO.1"", ""Piano Sonata NO.10 in G major OP.14 NO.2"", ""piano sonata no. 13 in E flat major op.27 no.1 ""quasi una fantasia"""" and ""Piano Sonata no.14 in C sharp minor op.27 no.2 ""moonlight"""".
However, the archive that was linked to does not list the same tracks on cd 13, so I'm a bit stumped."
,HarebSerap,2008-02-24T00:45Z,"Ah, there was more than one set. This wasn't Beethoven as the one I bought. Oh well, time to download it all then.
Sorry to have bothered you."

,severed1314,2008-10-22T03:47Z,"thank you, this is a great up!!"
,unpez,2008-10-29T21:32Z,"As said, class act! Torrent uploaded 2006 and it seems pretty alive to me. Wonderful and well organized (it seems)

Thanks!"
,daveggg,2008-11-05T16:12Z,"Lots of crappy recordings. Download complete cantatas instead with Ton Koopman. Absolute world class.

[V],Kuthumi,2008-12-12T19:59Z,"Davegg, your link does not work. The link to Sumotorrent is 16 Giga with FLAC-files. The point with this torrent here is that we can get it all burned to one data DVD. I will put it on random play.
This link should work to Sumotorrent: http://www.sumotorrent.com/en/details/46158/Bach%20-%20Cantatas%20-%20Vols%201-20%20-%20Ton%20Koopman[FLAC].html"
