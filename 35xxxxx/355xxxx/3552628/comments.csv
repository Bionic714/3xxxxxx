,ANP_,2006-11-06T20:50Z,"Many people have been complaining about the quality on this one...though I'm sure it will be enough for most of us, and it has DTS! :D Going to watch it now... :)"
[V],pryll,2006-11-06T20:57Z,"yes, many have complained before they actually saw the movie. if you have an ordinary tv-set and an ordinary dvdplayer this is pretty ok quality, even though  it is not a proper release. If you dont, I guess you just have to be patient and wait for the proper one."

,Foxxen,2006-11-07T10:50Z,"What's the difference between this one and http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3551673/Pirates.Of.The.Caribbean.Dead.Mans.Chest.NORDIC.PAL.DVDR-COS ?
And it's a pitty that the left DTS in the compressed version, because it almost takes 1/4 of DVD5 space."
,TBaberg,2006-11-07T12:10Z,"Rar 46, when I extract the file it says that rar46 is corrupt so I have to abort the extracting, have you had problems like this?

,phusg,2006-11-14T21:20Z,"Thanks for the upload. Nice having English subtitles (hardly any extra space) and DTS sound (big quality improvent over DD). Video still ~3GB so should be fine. Did you use DVDshrink to make this?

Am I the only one getting 4 .sfv errors when quickSFVing and a CRC error when trying to unrar this?"

,>>>mm<<<,2006-11-25T15:42Z,how i put these files in one file?? i dont know how use to WinRar..??please help
,TUA ManicMonkey,2006-11-28T21:41Z,"This file is corrupted, gee thanx again for a perfectly corrupted file. Maybe you guys from the fake torrent scene should read how to do shit properly instead of stealing from the real scene. We all know the Bittorrent scene is full of wannabee's, no real crackers here, lol. I say this because I know. Anyway as I was pointing out, maybe you guys (fake Torrent Scene) should read 'Why_RAR_archives_do_not_belong_in_torrents.txt' and maybe I wouldn't have gotten an error when trying to unrar this fucking movie I spent too much time downloading. I read some replies of some really dumb people saying this guy talks bullshit, well I've read it and it's everything but bullshit. Don't waver of some story because you don't agree with it or just because the first few lines weren't to your liking. You should be open for certain stuff, in such a way that it makes you think about what you're doing. Now maybe you're lazy to try and do some new stuff, but if that's the case don't go critisizing some guy's work because you're too lazy to change your way of working. Just read it, think about the logic in it and FUCKING LEARN from it. Once some kiddies start typing a string of code they suddenly think they're a cracker/hacker, this is soo pathetic. Don't flatter yourself, you're not that good, if you were then you'd be on the news now wouldn't you? LOL
Anyway, in the end this file is still corrupt, and now I need to find another torrent which might have been rarred as well by some stupid wannabee torrent user.
Thnx alot and keep up the oh so crooked work, fucking torrent scene losers... Waiting months for a suitable dvd copy still nothing "
,TUA ManicMonkey,2006-11-28T21:49Z,"Baby steps? Man go on a forum and find what u need, not alot of peeps here will spoon feed you, lol
neither will I, not that we're bad people its just that when i needed help who helped me?
don't be a lazy ass and do something urself too, dont sit around on ur ass waiting for it to reach you, search for it yourself."
,markus_d,2006-11-29T18:42Z,Vad är felet med denna? Får felmeddelande vid uppackningen i WinRar.
