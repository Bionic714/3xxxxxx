,RealGenius,2006-11-07T22:42Z,"Actually, quite a number of American Government Organizations still use DOS and even Windows 3.x. The costs of upgrading these ancient machines far outway the simple tasks they are assigned to do. Not just government Orgs. There are still people who use Windows 9x/Me, why is beyond me. One last point before I leave. Knowledge is Power. By learning about how to do thing in DOS, you acquire skills that could be useful in things like hacking windows xp or other systems. As a side note, I do not condone hacking as a means to sell, steal or destroy systems or information.
