Microangelo Creation is an advanced Windows XP icon editor you can use to edit and create icons for all Windows desktops.

Creation\'s user interface and drawing tools are very similar to Adobe Photoshop┬«. Unleash your creative skills with multiple image layers, allowing you to position, manipulate and blend the individual elements of your icon design.

Multiple image layers is just one of the benefits that Creation offers to maximize your creativity and results. Creating icons with Creation removes the shackles of a fixed, 256 color palette when editing hi-color icons, providing access to unlimited color selection, rich gradients, and smooth anti-aliasing.

Creation can import and export complete layer and selection information for all rasterized layers in Photoshop compatible (PSD) format. A Publish Check option insures your final images will support all Windows platforms that you target, offering specific details and resolving the problems that it detects.

Microangelo Creation is recommended for avid icon artists and professional developers. It can be purchased separately, and is also available in Microangelo Complete! for extra savings.
