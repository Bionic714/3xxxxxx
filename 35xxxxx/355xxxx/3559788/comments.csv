,Visor4,2006-11-27T23:22Z,"Well, I've been seeding for 10 days straight now... my share ratio's more than 3.4:1 and I've uploaded close to 40 GB.  I'll keep sharing so long as my provider allows me to (they tend to get a little irritated if I upload more than 60 GB in one month).  There are currently 13 seeders, but 3 days ago there were 23+.   I can only upload at a rate of 65 KB/s max so please continue to help me seed this 11 GB share.

Thanks,
ViSOR"
