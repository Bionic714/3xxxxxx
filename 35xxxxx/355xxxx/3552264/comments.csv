,rorschach43,2006-11-06T14:04Z,the movie with the most fucked up scenes ive seen ever! little known cult classic!! highly recommend.
,shakewell,2006-11-06T18:48Z,"I must agree with rorschach43, if you like weird, fucked-up, gory and sicko films, this one takes the cake. It came out in 1987 and is almost impossible to find on video. I actually went out and bought a copy several years ago, second hand. It's right up there with ""Blood Sucking Freaks."" Towards the end of the movie is a crazy scene where bums are playing ""salugee"" (aka ""keep away"") with someone's severed penis. Don't believe me, check out all the rave reviews over at IMDB:

Trivia: This is the first film to use a ""steadicam."""

Think I have seen this one for many years ago..."
