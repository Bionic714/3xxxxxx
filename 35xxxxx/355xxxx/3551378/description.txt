During his transfer to a new school, Yusuke starts to think his luck couldn\\\'t get worse. Due to a series of inexplicable, unfortunate accidents, he is left in a strange city with nowhere to live. What is he supposed to do now? 

Suddenly and completely unexpectedly, he runs into an old friend, whom he hasn\\\'t seen for years. The hyper-active Asumi decides that due to an old debt that she must repay (Yusuke can\\\'t even remember what she\\\'s talking about!), she will help him out with a place to live. She then drags him along to her dorm, where she announces to her two roommates that Yusuke will now be living with them! But it\\\'s an all-girl dorm!

Things continue to get more and more complicated. First, boys are forbidden in a girls\\\' dorm, so Yusuke has to dress up like a girl each and every day in order to go to class. Also, he is apparently the new housekeeper and is made to do all the cleaning. And they make him sleep in the closet, of all places! Last but not least, he finds himself slowly but surely drawn to these girls, and begins to care for them?.
