,crystaltears83,2007-08-23T07:49Z,"This game doesn't seem to work. Got it to install. Mounted the disk 1 image to do so. Try playing it after install. No luck.

Mounted image 1
Mounted image 2

Mounted all the files there and tried it each time just to see. Still keeps saying 'please insert the correct disk' blah."
,SmoothRKJ,2008-01-07T14:57Z,"Maybe the crack is in one of the images, crystaltears83?

It says that DirectSound doesn't work on your system that's why, Punkvicious. But don't ask what your gonna do 'bout it, 'cause I have no clue."

mount CD2 and use the .exe from this CD."

,Dawnshade,2008-12-24T23:16Z,"Do note that most 2-cd bishoujo games like this one have the 1st CD for installing, and the 2nd for playing. If the game doesn't work and if you happen to use Daemon Tools, try mounting CD 2 in the 1st emulator."
