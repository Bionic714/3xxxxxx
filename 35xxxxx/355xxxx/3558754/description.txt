This disc is in response to the previous torrent I posted which was a fix to one that was already posted.  This is a single DVD ISO FILE, not individual files like the previous torrent.  I decided to post this one because it seemed that people were having problems creating a good working disc.

Before, you could download a single language or the whole thing, the choice was yours.  Now you will have to download the whole file with this one before you can use it.  It is setup to have the autostart work.  Once this file is burned to a DVD it will work!  You have to remember to keep the disc in the drive when you are ready to use it otherwise the program won't see the language files.

You can also use programs like Alcohol 120% to mount the iso image on a Virtual CD/DVD drive and then you never have to burn it to disc.

The Rosetta Stone applicatoin version is 2.0.8.1A

Danish lvl 1

Dutch Lvl 1 & 2
