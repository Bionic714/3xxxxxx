,LOKI_LOKI,2006-11-17T01:13Z,I appreciate the interest everyone has seemingly taken to this torrent but please SEED!!  Already there are 40 leechers and this was just posted under 8 hours ago and there are only 2 seeders with myself being one of them.  If the rest of you would like to download this file faster please help to seed it.  Helping others will only help you in the long run.
,vagranthoo,2006-11-29T07:35Z,"Thanks for this excellent package!

I had successfully downloaded and installed this program. But it popped out a message box claiming that ""This version of the program is not licensed to run on your system"" when I run the main program. I have googled it but no meaningful results. Anybody can help me out of this? I do appreciate any kind of ideas.

Thanks!"
,LOKI_LOKI,2006-12-04T05:11Z,"I'm sorry, but I have not seen the error message you've mentioned.  I've done several installations on not only my machines but my friends as well and I've never seen this.  If anyone else has some information about this please post it here.  Thank you."
,LOKI_LOKI,2006-12-08T14:42Z,"I thought I would post this message from  vagranthoo.  He figured out what the problem is so maybe it will help anyone else who has a problem like this.

Subject: About the \\""This version of the program is not licensed to run on your system\\"" error. 
Message:  
LOKI_LOKI, Thanks for your kindly help! Finally I got my question resolved. It\\\'s simply because I\\\'m using an Asian operating system. For more information please check out: http://www.rosettastone.com/knowledgebase/SSL/WebHelp/CD/This_version_is_not_licensed_to_run_on_your_system.htm The only difference between the so-called \\""new application CD\\"" and the one you\\\'ve provided in this DVD image is the file Xtras\\\\FLTXtra.x32. Simply by replacing this file everything just works fine. If you\\\'d like to integrate it into your images I can mail this file to you. I\\\'m sorry that I just forgot the address where I had downloaded it. Thanks again for your great job! vagranthoo

Thank you for letting me know.  Hopefully this will help others."
,tingtongmakkadangdang,2007-01-07T13:12Z,"Can't use this. Downloaded it and burnt it to DVD and it says the file is corrupt and unreadable.

Download problem or does the file just not work?"
,LOKI_LOKI,2007-01-20T19:12Z,"Dear tingtongmakkadangdang,

You must have  had a problem with your download because the iso image file works fine and is not corrupted.  Please delete what you have and try downloading it again."

,LOKI_LOKI,2007-04-06T21:37Z,"There is a folder Called ""Macintosh OSX"" on the disk, however I do not know anything about getting Rosetta Stone to work on a Mac as I don't own one and have hardly ever used one.  The file in the Mac folder is named ""TheRosettaStone.v2.0.7OSX_OnlyAppli.sit"" if that helps.

Good luck and let me know how it turns out and maybe others here can help."
,cafs13,2007-05-29T14:31Z,"Hi LOKI, firts of all thnks for sharing. a question i DL this torrent. i got the applic. working but i can't get the lenguage data working. do u have some help for me.  how to install it. i would like to learn dutch 

thanks 
"
,LOKI_LOKI,2007-05-30T08:17Z,"Most of this is posted in the info section at the top for the DVD but I'll post it here again.

First off this image file was created to work on IBM compatible PC's.  There is a file located on the disk for MAC's but I can't give you any help there as I've never worked with a MAC before.

Second, the image file will either HAVE to be burned to disk or you can use a program like Alcohol120% to Mount it on a Virtual DVD drive.

The reason for this is that the Disk has to be in the drive in order for it to work and see the languages.
If you burn the image you have to remember to keep the disk handy when you want to run the program.
If you mount the image file you never have to worry about putting the disk in the drive.

The image is created so that it will Autorun on insert so it should start automatically when you put it in the drive or mount it.

Remember after it is installed the Disk has to be in the drive or mounted in order to run.

Good Luck, Hope this helps."

To crazyninja73: do you have another version of Rosetta Stone already installed on your pc? I had an old demo version on mine and it wouldn't let me install this one until I uninstalled the demo.  i hope you get it all resolved soon. "

,waltermb,2008-01-05T20:50Z,i was able to download--but i have noticed on several torrents i have tried--that after working for a few minutes in the program--what i have done isnt saved by the program. wonder if anyone knows what i am doing wrong-or if i should do something. looked all over the program for a switch--but it is supposed to save your work up to the point of closing automatically---every time i restart--it goes back to the beginning as if i never ran the program before--any suggestions greatly appreciatead.  robert

,ednum5,2008-01-15T00:24Z,"Hi mb11231, you probably need to start the Rosetta Stone application while the language DVD is in your DVD drive or mounted with Alcohol or Demon tools. None of the language discs I've seen start automatically."
,drtyygo,2008-01-15T05:38Z,just a quick question.. when using nero to burn the iso what do you click to burn the iso to a dvd?
,ednum5,2008-01-15T16:51Z,"Use ImgBurn instead, it's lots easier, no pointless complication of the interface and it appears in the context menu when you right-click an iso file in windows explorer."

[V],cezen,2008-01-22T23:24Z,"*Hi all, has anyone actually confirmed through using this that it is indeed all it says it is?  Are ALL the parts to ALL the individual units here?  

*Rosetta Stone does not sell a product with ALL the languages.  THe only thing they have close is a free disc with limited capacity.  

*So.. was this put together from complete copies of ALL the different langauges?  or is this just a copy of the free disc ( which you can get from rosetta stone.com)  .  

*While i have not downloaded and used this particular torrent, it does have the same files listed as the ulitmate language pack which is simply a copy of the free disc from the manufactuerer... call them to get this for FREE without the code written to steal your info.. yes, i love this site and use it ALOT, and 

*yes I am careful about what i download ESPECIALLY when it seems too good to be true.....got a credit card?  buy the software legit from rosetta stone, call them in 1 month ( after you made your own iso) and get ALL your money back except shipping.  Works like a charm and they don't ask questions.  

*Another thing, i have found that the languages that are listed individually in the torrent index are legitimate and have not been messed with as far as hidden apps/exe files.  I have had no bad experiences with downloading the individual languages and using them.  

*stepping off soapbox"
,Coolman66,2008-04-16T01:27Z,Thanx. Works good for me.
,LOKI_LOKI,2008-06-07T05:03Z,"Sorry Guys, I had forgotten my password and was unable to get back in to this account to post comments.
To answer cezen's question.  This is not a copy of the free discs.  This is a compilation that was first put together by BobbyJoe but all he did was provide the files then you had to use your tech savvy smarts to figure out how to make it work and some of the languages didn't work so what I did was tried to make it easy for people to use.  First, I fixed the languages that didn't work then I decided to put everything on 1 DVD that I possibly could then make the image file.
The reason I made the image file is quite frankly because I got tired of trying to walk people through my other upload.  People just couldn't figure it out.  There are a lot less questions here compared to the other UL."

thank you"
,morrison0880,2008-10-30T21:39Z,"Hey all. Go to 
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3865583/Rosetta_Stone_Ultimate_Language_Disk_v2.iso
You get every language in an iso file. No Extracting, all you have to do is burn it to a disc with PowerISO or Alcohol and it autostarts when you load it. You can also mount it to your virtual drive. It comes with all the help files, language sheets, and even a bonus language program. Works perfectly. I got this about a year ago and I love it.
Oh, and only 3.62 GB, so it fits perfectly on a DVD, or takes up as little space on your HD as possible. Trust me, this is the easiest way to go. I tried torrents like this, and the set up and installation alone was the biggest pain in the a...With this, no installation is needed.

The file is in ISO format. You don't have to install the program to your computer. You can use PowerISO to burn it to a disc, and it will autorun on your computer anytime after you put the disc in. Or, if you don't want to burn it, simply use the ""Mount"" option in PowerISO and choose to mount image to drive [E]. It should then open up the file folder with RS in it. If it doesn't, go to ""My Computer"", right click on your new (E) drive, and click run. That's all you have to do. Rosetta Stone will run on its own, no installation needed, no extracting files, it is all self-contained. You will see every language, all you have to do is choose one and off you go."
,LOKI_LOKI,2008-11-16T12:01Z,"morrison0880,
While I appreciate your enthusiasm about other torrents it was inappropriate for you to fish for other downloaders here by posting your comment and torrent link here.  This isn't like other torrents for rosetta stone.  This is a DVD ISO image of the western languages.  There is NOTHING difficult about using this torrent more than there is with the one you posted about.  They both require the use of image mounting software or burning them to disc if you so choose.  The setup and installation is no more than having to click next all the way through the setup process.  The problem with what you are suggesting by not installing the software is that the program will not memorize what language and which lesson you left off at so you can begin at the same spot again simply by logging in to the software's interface and I use a different log in for each language I'm trying to learn so I can go back to exactly where I left off without having to try and remember where for each language.

Before you comment on someone else's torrent please try be a little more educated about the torrent instead of putting it down otherwise you run the risk of looking like an idiot."
,Bittornado,2008-12-12T00:02Z,"First off a big thanks to the uploader, not only for the upload itself, but also for something else which i pretty rare among other uploaders... which is well written comments, replies and follow ups to our comments here. Much much appreciated.

I just have a short question. Looking at the other upload of yours, it seems as if you did include Level 3 of the Latin American Spanisch language, whereas this ISO-version sayg only Level 1 & 2.
Am I correct on that point, or Level 3 text maybe was just forgotten to be included in the information box here?

I would very much like to get Level 3 of the Latin American Spanish language as well so a short reply to this question would be again appreciated.

Thank you in advance and please keep up the good work.

/Bittornado"
,LOKI_LOKI,2008-12-17T07:06Z,"Bittornado,
Level 3 was not included in the previous upload.
However I can see where you might think that.
When looking at the info I posted for the other upload it looks like this:

Language		size  image files used
----------------------------------------------
Spanish (Lat Am) I	123 	3
Spanish (Lat Am) II	129	3


Only Levels 1 & 2 are listed.  Maybe you saw the 3, which is under the column for ""image""
and thought that meant Level 3?  The 3 under image merely stands for the picture set
which is used for that particular language.  It is because a lot of the languages share the same picture
set that makes it possible for them to all be put on a DVD like this.

I'll have to get back to you about Level 3.  I'm not sure if I have level 3 for version 2 of the software."
,billrx,2009-01-26T02:57Z,"Way to go! This is by far the best and easiest to run version of Rosetta Stone I've come across. I've tried quite a few. As long as you have the software to burn the iso file, it's the user friendly version. I wonder why level three isn't available? Thank you, thank you. I'm gonna seed this one.

,listwah,2009-03-12T01:58Z,"I'm having a really hard time loading the ISO onto a dvd. I've had no problems with loading them onto a CD but obviously with the size of this file it's not possible. 
 Could you possibly load up welsh separately? I swear I've put in about ten hours trying to fix this. No-one has this one as a stand alone. 
 It's worth asking but I completely understand if you don't want to."
