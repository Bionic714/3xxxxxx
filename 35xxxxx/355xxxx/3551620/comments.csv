,CampyCamper,2008-06-27T16:05Z,"That tracklist is very wrong unstabil. You're right that it's weekender 8 but the tracklist is for the cd which is not live recording, it's just some of the songs they played mixed by different DJs.

This is the real tracklist:

	Paul Maddox- 'I Can't Let Go' (Tidy)
	Paul Maddox- 'La La De' (White)
	Guyver- 'Gouryella' (Tidy)
	Carl Nicholson- 'Blue Print' (Tidy)
	Colin Barrat- 'Get Down' (Gravity Trapp)
	Faithless- 'Insomnia' (Chamion)
	Alf Bamford- 'N20' (Tidy)
	Heaven's Cry- 'Til Tears Do Us Part' (Tidy)
	System F- 'Out of the Blue' ( London )
	Tony De Vit- 'The Dawn' (Tidy)
	Signum- 'What Ya Got For Me' (Tidy)
	Paul Maddox- 'In It For The Kicks' (Tidy)


Keep it Tidy ;)"
