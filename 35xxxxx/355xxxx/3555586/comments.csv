Maybe can find used disk."
,Video_Veg,2009-04-15T04:31Z,"Well, I hung in and 2 seeders came back online and I eventually got the files.
Will leave it on for a while so others don't suffer like I did. 
It really is better than current movie, with many more scenes and the superior BBC radio play sound track integrated."
