,skowfritt,2006-11-06T19:19Z,He uploads it again but doesn`t seed. Wonderful! 
[V],Murlok,2006-11-06T20:39Z,Time to seed !! I love this story Do you have a new upload ?
,black curtian,2006-11-06T20:56Z,how about some seed please.
,orionsune,2006-11-06T22:09Z,"what are you guys talking about, i've been seeding it since i uploaded the torrent.. geeze"
,olav66,2006-11-07T00:08Z,"I think the uploader honestly is seeding; it's just that he is firewalled and/or on too many torrents at the moment. If firewalled, he can't connect to leechers who are also firewalled. You just need to wait until a non-firewalled leecher comes along.

If on too many torrents at the same time, please do NOT spread your bandwidth too thin! 
Unless you have a super bandwidth, please jump off torrents until you're left with only a couple and continue seeding this one.

As an uploader you're responsible for letting people leech from you.

After you're done 100%, you're free to go elsewhere and leave the seeding to ppl who's already snatched your torrent... and of course, they should stay on until reaching a factor of 1:1 share ratio.

If ppl. got used to do that there'd be not much hassle amongst users here on PB :-) It's all about sharing, ain't it..?

Hopes are for the future.

Thanks again."

Thanks"
,orionsune,2006-11-08T02:30Z,"no big deal, I just don't understand why people have such a hard time leeching from me, my box I seed from is not behind a firewall and is capped at 300k/sec upstream speeds so I love seeding because of the good outgoing bandwidth I have available..."

,maxair90,2008-05-15T19:27Z,hey how do i install this? should I burn into a disc first before I install first? or just run the installation after dl finished?
,tengwar3,2008-05-18T02:51Z,"What program should i use to burn this image?  I tried MagicISO and Roxio to burn both nrg and the ISO formats, and both to a CD-R and a DVD-R  Each time i booted up it said that booting failed.  Any ideas?  Also keep in mine i am working on a duel boot with vista, but that should pose no problem with the disk starting up anyways.  I have also tried disabling the boot up from my HDD at the same time.  What should i do next?"
