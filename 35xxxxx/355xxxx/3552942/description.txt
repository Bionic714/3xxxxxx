Ever since Brain Voyager was released in 1985 it has remained a favorite. Its smooth, unfettered electronic keyboard style washes over your mind in pastel waves of aqua and lavender. Sequencer-driven cruisers give way to choral splendor on \"Glücksgedanken,\" sung by Monika Rath. Then the gorgeous theme of \"Love Symphony\" rises out of the fading stillness. Slipping on headphones, one embarks on a relaxing voyage through the electro-chemical universe of neuro-pathways. Memories lived or yet to be dissolve into one another like vaporous phantoms. Even as Schroeder builds up tension, layer by layer, a safety valve releases and you drift back on course. Chronologically, Brain Voyager is in the middle of Schroeder\'s many releases, but he has never duplicated this magical style before or since. His melodic themes vary, and never exceed seven minutes in length, unlike most of his IC titles, keeping the material as fresh and relevant as when it was released.
