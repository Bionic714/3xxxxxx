,snafas,2006-11-10T21:56Z,"Is it only me that are having problems with ST TNG S2D4? The episodes play just fine, but the submenu for the third episode on the disc (don't remember the name at the moment) doesn't work properly, i.e. the screen image doesn't show so the same image that was shown before (e.g. the previous meny screen) remains visible. This means that navigating the submeny to start the episode is quite difficult.

I've downloaded the torrent twice, burnt it to disc three times and created a disc image and run it on my computer once and the same problem remains.

Does anyone else have this problem or am I the only one? Does anyone know how to fix this?"

Snafas , I have checked my S2D4 and I don't have any of the problems you discribed (or any other problem) .
Mayby you have to re-instal your burning program to fix the problem ?"
