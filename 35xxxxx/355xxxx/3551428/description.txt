The talented book dealer Corso (Depp) is hired by the obscure obsessive Balkan to find the only other two copies of his rare book in existence. The book is called \'The Nine Gates of the Kingdom of Shadows\', and Balkan wants to authenticate his copy of this 17th century occult work, said to have been written by the devil. And thus begins an almost \'Angel heart\'ish (remember that one with Rourke and De Niro) escapade, filled with physical and supernatural catalysts and obstacles
