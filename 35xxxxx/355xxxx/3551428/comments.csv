There are only 1 left in the swarm, and i'm kinda stuck on 57%..

I will keep seeding this file, until there are no more peers for a week..

Support the community please."
,DogNo7,2006-11-07T10:21Z,"The reason there are not more seeders is that this is an original file.  Hence, it has to start from one seed.  As I write this, there are 40 seeders.

I am open to suggestions as to how to more rapidly seed feeds with the bandwidth I have.  Until I learn of a different way, I will make the best use of my bandwidth that I can, and limit the number of files I am seeding at a time."

Thanx for sharing!"
,DogNo7,2007-03-18T07:01Z,"To explain the end of the film would ruin the film for other peeps.  The ultimate explanation, and the most honest one, is that the end means whatever you think it means.

A really nice movie that lets you thinking when the end credits are rolling."
,Vitek/88,2007-05-06T19:29Z,"It must be played in DivX, but everytime I play the movie it just gets stuck at a random point, which makes me unable to see it properly. This really is a shit version, wanna let you know that!"
,DogNo7,2007-05-18T22:47Z,"Sorry its a ""shit"" version.  Video, sound, and everything are excellent.

You must be DMCA mustardmeat Vitek.  It plays fine on every computer and divx, xvid compatible computer and DVD player [divx mode] available."

Good Luck"
