While the music for the first ACT album by the great-great-granddaughter of Leo Tolstoy was all specially composed by Esbjörn Svensson, this "beautiful singer with classiness coursing in her blood" (Tonart) has dedicated her latest totally to her home country. MY SWEDISH HEART is an expression of love and a tribute to the great Swedish jazz composers from Lars Gullin to her contemporaries. 

Sweden developed a particularly active jazz scene before all other European countries, helped by the fact that many American greats didn't just tour in Sweden but also made their homes there. The list is long and impressive: Stan Getz, Art Farmer, Dexter Gordon, Sahib Shihab, Ben Webster, Idrees Sulieman, Bill Evans, Quincy Jones, to name but a few. The musical exchange of these great talents with the local scene resulted in a long list of exceptional local jazz musicians: Lars Gullin, Arne Domnerus, Ake Persson, Rune Gustafsson and Bengt-Arne Wallin. All were accepted as equals by their American friends and peers, even in the 1950s. The album releases from that time bear witness to the high level of musicianship. 

For her new album Viktoria Tolstoy has immersed herself deeply in Swedish jazz culture and selected a special homage from the large choice available.
