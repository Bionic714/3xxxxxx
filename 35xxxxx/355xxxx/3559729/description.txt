This British album preserves a real acid rock rarity, the 1969 US album from Steven Morgen; it includes "Welcome to the Void."

Reissue of ultra rare but all time favorite psychedelic 60's album from USA. Led by Steven Morgen, who simply named his band Morgen. A true psychedelic artifact originally released on Probe in 1969. Comes with original artwork 'The Scream' from Edvard Munch. 7 tracks. Radioactive. 2003.

One of the best pure psychedelic albums of all time. Heavy fuzz guitar all over the place with trippy lyrics to go with it. There is not a bad song on this album, with the highlights being "purple" and "love". Every psych collector needs this album.
