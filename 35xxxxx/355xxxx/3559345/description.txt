Release Notes:

Through a combination of zealous righteousness and post-punk experimentalism,
U2 have become one of the most popular rock bands of all time. Equally known
for their sweeping sound as for their grandiose statements about politics and
religion, they are rock and roll crusaders, who have undoubtedly influenced
generations of bands. 'U218 Singles' is their latest greatest hits album, a
career-spanning collection of 16 songs, and two new tracks, including their
new single, 'The Saints Are Coming', a collaboration with Green Day released
as part of Hurricane Katrina charity Music Rising.
