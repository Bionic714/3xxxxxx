This is the first movie of the project \"Lost - The Movie\". Lost - The Movie is the edited version of the Lost series, with no flashbacks, and where important scenes are moved in order to follow the historical timeline chronological. The movie starts off in 1999 following Desmond and his release from military prison. This first part of the movie ends at the castaway\'s third day on the island.
The most spectacular part of this film has to be the plain crash, where you (still precisely following the timeline) get a look from three different part of views. The Others, The Castaways and Desmond.

Enjoy...
