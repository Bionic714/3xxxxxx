,norsee,2006-11-10T20:22Z,"It's real and it's fresh. Only I have seen it, and I'm the one who made it :)"
,Mitjmannen,2006-11-10T20:32Z,"The download-speed is very low, actualy it's not downloading :p

But thanks, looking forward to see it :)"
,norsee,2006-11-10T20:34Z,"Oh, I'm sorry. Forgot to start the seeding. It's seeding now..."
,Mitjmannen,2006-11-10T20:38Z,"Hehe, that's better, working now."
,norsee,2006-11-10T22:18Z,"It didn't take long time to edit, but it took quite some time to encode. And I had to give it a lot of tries before I desided to just serve like a DVD image.
The quality is good but not excelent, and  have to blame crappy Pinnacle studio for that.
Total time: 1 week."
,mullhippiar,2006-11-11T15:51Z,"Hehe First i thought that some noob put up some seasons and called it a movie x'D  But now I think Norsee is a little more than a noob :)   Gonna clean my HD first, then im gonna DL!
Cheers!"

Next part (Lost - The Movie, part 2) will be made in Sony Vegas, cut from a DVD-rip and converted to XVID.

This first part was a test, made in Pinnacle, cut from downloaded AVI-files converted to MPG."

,thrapgid,2006-11-13T09:19Z,"norsee...you are my new best friend, just burnt to disc and starting watching...the quality so far looks excellent...you have to mail me when part 2 is available!"
,zorpry,2006-11-13T11:44Z,"Please dont call it a movie when it is homemade from a few episodes.
Nothing to do with a movie, even the quality is fine.
Has no ending.
Like serving a cool drink, without having a chance to taste the drink.
You should call it what it is.
Also you are in debt for serving the ending.
Otherwise you shouldn't start it.
Just my opinion."
,screenslave,2006-11-13T11:51Z,"Dude, this rocks! Great initiative and well executed - clearly aimed at the diehard-Lost-fans (like me). To experience the story linear is very interesting and you've done a great job. Naturally, it helps if you've seen the real series (seasons 1-3) to add some context, but having it edited like this is superb. Very well done and tremendous work! Here's nothing new in addition to what's been seen, but the editing puts the story in a linear fashion with many advantages: to experience the crash simoltaneusly through Desmonds, the passengers and the island people (""the others"") adds a lot. I think norsee (who did this) doesn't confuse anyone with the origin of this, everything is clearly stated and the usual complainers can go elsewhere. Qualitywise ok, even if the format changes sometimes (very few). Like I said, terrific stuff!"
,norsee,2006-11-13T17:20Z,"zorpry: It's a project, not a movie. If Lost should be made as a movie instead of a serie, then they would have to introduce the story more chronologicaly.

My attempt is to give you an idea of how that would look, but to make a real movie like the movies you know is quite awkward since I don't have access to video cameras, original location and Lost actors.

Anyway: I'ld like to say thank you those of you who liked this thing..."
,screenslave,2006-11-13T18:20Z,"I think most of us understand that perfectly, norsee. And you've given it a hell of a shot! Like I said, to experience the story linear when the plane is about to crash - seen from both Desmond's, the passengers and the others point of view - that's a knock-out. Really appreciate your efforts, keep them coming!"
,awe_92,2006-11-15T22:30Z,"Do you have a deadline, when the next one should be finished?"
,duncan6,2006-11-15T23:47Z,"Plz can anyone help me , what is the song called in the start?? and whos teh artist, very thnxful if anyone coudl help me  out :P"
,frankarmoton,2006-11-16T00:01Z,"Hi!

,majalogan,2006-11-16T14:07Z,"Sounds like a very interesting idea, but a 4GB download, some of us in the thirld world country Australia have 256kb lines with 10gb maximum per month you know ... is there a divx version ?"
