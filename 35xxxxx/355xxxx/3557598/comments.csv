,deverry,2006-11-16T16:01Z,Helt underbart. Jag seedar s책 mycket jag kan.
,Pirate_Albo,2006-11-16T23:20Z,"This is great except for the annoyance that it's all in one huge MP3; not even divided into individual CDs.
But it is complete, and it works."
,deverry,2006-11-21T04:11Z,Some people don't want it all in one big mp3. That messes up my mp3player. Plus it's much easyer to find where you left off if its split up like this.
,deverry,2006-11-21T04:16Z,"I mean it's much easyer to find where you left off if its split up, and _not_ like this.
But i too think its a great torrent.
I'll stop spaming now >_"
,anders.xson,2006-12-23T20:26Z,"What sort of idiot creates an 8 hour long mp3? Really? You got to be quite lucky not to accidently start playing something else when you are in the midst of it. 

Anyone got a version with smaller files?"

,gavinmgraham,2007-05-20T19:52Z,Good god you lazy bastards. Get an mp3 splitter and split it up your selfs.

,fatbird,2007-10-05T01:24Z,And that took me almost 3 seconds to find!
,Spalli,2007-10-20T22:59Z,"Just as a comment: in my opinion audiobooks should have low sampling rate (since the human voice doesnt have those higher frequencies anyway) and big files... at least CD size if not bigger...

But thats not the point.. Can you plz tell me if the book is abridged or not... ?  You loose so much pratchet humor if you litsen to his books abridged..."
,Heyaz,2008-01-24T21:09Z,"thx marra,

canny git stuff!

seems to be full version, at around half of the track is the part where i'm at reading atm.

Stephen Briggs gives a brilliant performace. Big Wee Fun ah'd say ^^"
,BabeB,2011-10-30T03:28Z,"Thanks! I appreciate the share so much, but I too plan to split it up into more manageable, smaller files. :)"
