I haven't seen this particular video -- yet -- but I have been exposed to a great deal of material covering the same subject matter. For example, Eric Phelps, and to a lesser extent, Greg Szymanski. Also Lenny Bloom of cloakanddagger.de, together with the late Great Sherman Skolnick, all confirm this ""conspiracy theory.""

The Jesuits have been around since the 1500s, and their goal is to roll back the Reformation, restore the Pope's temporal power over all the Earth's governments. See for example the Council of Trent. It is an historical truth that the Jesuits have been expelled, at one time or another, from just about every nation.

Think about it. Every town has some bum who's been kicked out of every bar on Main Street. One or two, that's one thing. But every bar in town, there's a reason for that.

What you should be asking yourself, is how come people know so little about the Jesuits, and their role in ongoing world history?..."
,Kiasyd117,2006-11-20T19:31Z,"Simply absurd, the ""creator"" of this piece fails to make a cogent argument at all instead merely clipping together file footage from other ""they're taking over america"" pieces in an attempt to lend credence to his baseless argument.  The author's claims are not aided in any way by the disjointed piece he presents, the audience is merely presented with a slideshow of random images so quickly that they become confused as to the goings on and inadvertantly arrive at the same conclusion as the author.  There is more truth in a Chick Track, and that is saying alot given the fact that Chick Tracks are the greatest piece of hate filled filth ever published.  And this review is comming from a pagan with no vested interest in the survival or dissolution of the Jesuits."

Get a fucking life.

Oh, by the way. I can sprout wings and fly. Watch out, or I'll piss on your head!"
,Murphy416,2010-03-16T00:24Z,"Nice to see an intelligent comment shakewell. One thing about the Jesuits is, they certainly seem to reek havoc wherever they go. They've been kicked out of almost every country in Europe, because they're so divisive. I was hearing that there were quite a number of Jesuits in the White House under the Bush administration, and It doesn't look like things have changed a great deal with Obama in office. But yeah, I would really like to find some kind of list of names 'cause they're not easy to follow.

@iamwhoam
I love being insulted by people who don't have a freaking clue. I get a laugh every time. XD"
