,DigiQ8,2006-11-11T06:11Z,"Yea but some people reported that you can install it without the serial code, and Windows will give you 30 days to enter it.

So you can choose Ultimate and use it for 30 days, and when a serial number leak you can use it.

there is no 'evaluation' or whatever watermark in the lower right.

I did not use the key from this release as I'm planning on using my MSDN key in a week or so when its out officially. So I just skipped teh cd key and picked' vista business'.

,arabesc,2006-11-11T10:06Z,Is it x86 or x64 version?

,Dutchman01,2006-11-11T10:41Z,"This is really the right version people.

I did install today with the serial in the NFO file.
Running Vista Business now.

And yes you can chose a other version if you are going to install. but with the right key the right version shows up on top.
And yes if you dont have a serial you got 30 days to activate.


OS Name	Microsoft® Windows Vista? Business
Version	6.0.6000 Build 6000
Hardware Abstraction Layer	Version = ""6.0.6000.16386""

THIS IS NOT A FAKE

Its the real right version.

Got past the 50% by using the method mentioned earlier.

My guess is that earlier Vista Beta files are locket and can not be deleted, even by the Vista installer.

I solved the problem by installing Vista by booting the DVD and Format the C: drive during the installation. It then went trouble free in just 15 minutes. 

I did not type in any keys, just leave the product key info blank when installing, and choose whatever version you want. That way you will get 30 days to track a valid key, and hopefully a wga patch as well. 

A lot of missing drivers, do not expect a trouble free Windows in a long time after installing this...."

Swapping in the two RC2 files works fine for activation, although this activation will expire at the end of May or maybe sooner since Vista runs WGA in the backround from time to time and since there are no thrid party firewalls for Vista, it is difficult to know when Vista is phoning home to Microsoft. Also, this activation method does leave the 'evaluation copy' notice on the screen, just like is on the beta versions of Vista.

Used the cdkey from the nfo file, choose ultimate. Working like clockwork. All devices detected except soundcard. Updated driver through windows vista and then the sound worked too.. Dont know about all problems u ppl are talking about.
Burning without a hitch, installed without a hitch. No activation warning or any stuff like that.

But my recommendation is install this on a second harddrive or a second partition and leave your old xp intact so u can go back in case it doesnt work..

Ultimate installation takes up 8gb on my disk so OMFG!!

I had the file corrupt error message too when I first tried to install and it was making me tear my hair out. I managed to get it working but I am still not sure how. Here is what I did to generate the error message:

ORIGINALLY I DID THIS AND IT FAILED:

Burnt at max speed
Tried to update instead of boot from CD

What you need to do is:

1. Download Dvd Decrypter (it's free!)
2. Burn the Iso to a DVD+R (mine was a 4x speed dvd but I burnt it at 2x speed)
3. Restart your pc with the cd in the drive and let it boot from cd
4. When it asks you for a cd key DO NOT PUT ONE IN
5. chose vista ultimate
4. Carry on with the install (you will lose all program information but all files on the hdd before installation will be in a folder called windows.old once you install)

this should work. I heard there is a 30 day period to find a vista ultimate cd key but I can't find anywhere in the version I have installed that this is the case."

That's why I haven't downloaded from a public torrent site like this one. About two years ago, I got the big copyright infringement envelope from MGM for downloading a TV show off a public torrent site.

Lucky for you your ISP doesn't warn you or care. My ISP (formerly adelphia, now time warner), does care, and they have a two strike warning. And they claim that by US law, an ISP has to terminate a subscribers service if they get two copyright infringement violations.

Using torrent sites like this one for popular software (especially the newest windows), is really a bad idea for Americans. It's quite sad that Americans have to feel like they were in some other part of the world where the companies don't push around the people like they do here."

Let me summarize what I just said for ADHD people: read comments and then ask question. 100kb/s download and 12kb/s upload -- it isn't hard to achieve ideal download conditions, IF you know what you're doing. Well, I suppose if you have 56k....just give up. Get a DVD from a friend :)

Latest Chinese KMS server (updated Dec 22, 2006) 


KMS server: 

kms.vbs.net.cn:1478 (or vbs.net.cn:1478), will be operate from now on till 24th Dec free of charge for worldwide KMS activation. Improved speed and no more waiting... 


After 25th Dec, the port number will be changed daily. For detail.. 

http://www.vistafans.com/viewthread.php?tid=75982 


KMS activiation is what Microsoft uses to activate Business Vista in Enterprise, it is not a crack or hack but an official activation. 


INSTRUCTIONS: 


#01) Install Vista Business Edition final release with key YFKBB-PQJJV-G996G-VWGXY-2V3X8 

(Only Business Edition or Enterprise Edition, not others !!) 


#02) Make sure you can connect to the Internet, then run ""Command Prompt"" in Admin mode... 


- From STAR menu, ACCESSORIES, Run ""COMMAND PROMPT"" as admin 


(Right click the ""COMMAND PROMPT"" icon, select ""Run as Admin"" from the sub-menu) 



#03 In Command Prompt (Admin mode) dialog, type 



cscript c:\windows\system32\slmgr.vbs -skms kms.vbs.net.cn:1478 


OR 


cscript c:\windows\system32\slmgr.vbs -skms vbs.net.cn:1478 



wait for response, then type 


cscript C:\windows\system32\slmgr.vbs -ato 



wait for a moment to get confirmation, Vista Business edition now activated !!! 


To check status, 


cscript c:\windows\system32\slmgr.vbs -dlv 



If error occurs, check - 


is your key YFKBB-PQJJV-G996G-VWGXY-2V3X8 ??? 


is your Vista Business edition final release??? 


did you run Command Prompt under Admin mode??? 


server maybe busy? try another time. 


For details and update - http://www.vistafans.com/viewthread.php?tid=75982 


If you use Chinese search engines to search KMS server and find some of them asking for money, do NOT pay !!

1.Burn iso with nero (for noobs: it doesnt mean that you burn iso file to the disk.... just select ""burn from disk image"" (or something like that)
2.Rewrite cd-key somewhere :P
3. go to bios and set some big year like 2080 
4. restart pc, and whan it writes press any key, press it :P 
5. install with the cd-key
6. After instalation (and configuring) install some soft and play etc...
7after few starts of vista go back to bios and restore normal date (BEFORE restoring normal date in bios, disable automatic time from internet) Itll be better if you set internet connection after point 7 :D. When date is restored you can use it forever-30days since the year you set in bios :D"

from page 12 lazy buggers

tutorial ....

1. Download the torrent using your favourite BT client, such as uTorrent or Azuerus.

2. Make sure the torrent is fully completed then use WinRAR to extract vistartm.rar

3. You are now left with an ISO file - DON'T burn this to DVD yet as it contains a minor error and installation will probably FAIL

4. Open up a hex editor such as WinHex and go to offset 0x4E932855. Make this change here: byte 0xFD should be 0xFF. Save the file. (This is quite complicated and there are apps that will automatically patch the BillGates ISO. However if you're comfortable with hex editing do it manually as you know exactly what change is being made and that it's being done *RIGHT*)

5. Your ISO is now ready for burning. Fire up Nero or CloneCD and select the ISO. Burn it to a DVD-(+)R.

6. Make a new partition for Vista. You'll be better off. Make 10GB of space at least available for Vista.

7. Restart your computer with the DVD in the drive. It should boot into Vista setup.

8. You can enter this key when prompted (it's the one included with the NFO):

YFKBB-PQJJV-G996G-VWGXY-2V3X8

Skip entering the key if you can. Alternatively, you can obtain a key from http://www.microsoft.com/windowsvista/PCTrialResults1.aspx?s=151&refer=%2Fwindowsvista% and use that instead. This is probably the better option.

That's it. Now should have installed Windows Vista. You're free to use it for 30 days without activating it.

Part B of the tutorial is what to do about the 30-day activation problem.

1. You need to replace some core files from the Release Candidates of Vista into Vista. Download this torrent http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3555654/Microsoft.Windows.Vista.RTM.PROPER.Activation.Crack-ReeBSaW and follow the instructions therein.

2. Obtain a key from http://www.microsoft.com/windowsvista/PCTrialResults1.aspx?s=151&refer=%2Fwindowsvista% if you haven't done so already.

3. You will have to go into safe mode, do a number of file copies and permissions changes to make this work. FOLLOW the instructions on the torrent's page.

4. After you complete all the steps, your copy of Vista should be activated - BUT - there's a catch. Your copy of Vista will only work for about 6 months because it has only been activated as a beta.

So maybe it's best not to activate just yet. Another solution has also been proposed by someone in these comment pages which I will post next. It's a temporary fix."
,blaze7,2007-01-24T09:23Z,"* Ok Here's A Quick Temporary Fix To Bypass Activation:

1. Burn Your Windows Vista RTM Build 6000 ISO

2. Disable/Unplug Your Internet Connection

2. Enter Your Bios And Set Your Date Year To 2099 (or whats the max year that your bios is capable of ex: on my desktop i set it to year 2070 and my laptop year 2099)

3. Boot From Your DVD

4. Dont Enter A Product Key! (leave it blank and a command will prompt click ""No"")

5. Wait Until Windows Vista Finishes Installation!

6. When Vista Installation Is Finished And Goes To The Windows Where You'll Enter Your Desired Account Name & Password Followed By Computer Name Don't Enter Anything Just Press SHIFT + F10 Key A Command Prompt Will Pop-Up Then type ""taskmgr"" (without the """") Go To Processes And End The Program Called ""msoobe.exe"" By Clicking End Process.

7. The Account Creation Screen Should Disappear & The Welcome Screen Will Appear But With A User Called ""Other User"" Click The Arrow Button In The Right Corner Then Click ""Restart""

8. Upon Restart Press F8 Key Then Go To Safe Mode

9. Now When Your In Safe Mode Go To START>RUN>type control userpasswords2 (the user accounts setting should appear)

10. Go To Advanced Tab & In Advanced User Managament Click>Advanced

11. You'll See Two Folders Named Users & Groups

12. Double-Click Users Folder Then Right Click The Icon Named Administrator & Unchecked The Setting That Says ""Account Is Disabled"" Click OK>OK

13. Don't Restart Your Computer Not Yet

14. In The Clock Time Shown In The Taskbar Right Click On The Clock & Click Adjust Date & Time

15. Go To Internet Time TAB > Change Settings > And Unchecked Synchronize With An Internet Time Server > Press OK

16. Restart Your Computer. Go To Bios And Reset Your Normal Date Year (don't plug your internet cable yet!not yet!)

17. You'll Notice That Your Username Is Administrator

18. Now Go To Run And Typed winver it will say that the product is licensed to: Windows User (you'll think why not my name?)

19. And In My Computer Properties The Computer Name Has A Randomized Name

*The Trick!

20. Go To Folder Options And Check Show Hidden Files & Folders

21. Browse To C:\Windows\system32\oobe and Run msoobe.exe

22. Put In Your Desired Account Name + Computer Name + Date & Time Zone And Your All Set

23. Vista Will Analyze Your Computer's Performance

24. When The Performance Check Is Complete

25. You'll Be Back On Your Administrator Account Desktop Go To START>RUN>type control userpasswords2 > advanced > in advanced user management click advanced > double click users folder > right click administrator then properties > and check account is disabled > restart your computer

26. Plug In Your Internet Connection LAN Cable

27. Then Take A Look At Your winver & my computer properties!

*30 Days Activation But Not Until Year 2099 (or what ever year you set)

*tested this by myself and ive been running windows vista for 3 days now with this trick and still 30 days to activate! "
,blaze7,2007-01-24T09:26Z,Above guides by WhatDoYouThink
,blaze7,2007-01-24T09:50Z,"Unlike a previous comment said,  WGA was infact beaten easily in XP. Vista uses keys to identify the type of install.  If you use beta keys you will get a evaluation install that lasts 160 days. If you get a RTM key it will be checked against a licensing sever.

This is why you should not use a key and beat the evaluation time instead until a way to disable the WGA component is found. Otherwise future updates will blacklist your key or your evaluation copy will stop in March or whenever.

There are plenty of options to identify build type, your key, days left to deactivation etc. etc

Turning off automatic updates is a good idea."

I`ve encountered an error myself, and out of experience i`d say there might be something wrong with the rar files or the .iso after unraring. Depends if you`re using an old winrar version. Try upgrading your winrar, if this doesn`t work, change your torrent client (!) if you`re not already using www.utorrent.com .. recommend this one.

For me, think its because of network mounted iso for burning. Anyway, ive used rc1 and beta1, so I dont bother anymore, tomorrow i`ll buy the damn software :-)"

DO NOT download ""Vista Validation Update KB929391"" or it will then Deactivate your Genuine Copy of WIndows thus, making your vista experience feel like XP...  but whats funny about that is if u accidently download that update , all u have to do is do a system restore and set the restore point to before u installed the update!!!! lol i think thats hilarious becuase it actually works!!!

,frodo_faggins,2007-02-04T09:43Z,"Right everybody Follow this and you will be fine.
You dont acualy need a cd key/serial for windows vista.

(1) Install the RTM build 6000 > ""Microsoft.Windows.Vista.Final-BillGates""

(2) Turn your modem OFF when installing and do not enter a serial key.

(3) I Selected Ultimate Edition since im running Vista Business on my other comp hehe.

(4) Then once install completed switch ur modem back on then download ""TimeStop""  From here or on Demonoid.

(5) that will keep ur 30 day trial period at 30 days.

Other notes to consider.
I suggest that you dont download windows updates the security on the computer is good enough for the time being. Unlike alot of people all my drivers got detected for me fine had no issues. There are windows updates what can cancel ur ""TimeStop"" so i would'nt bother really. Do not try and access the "" KMS server since you have no entered a cd key/serial on instalation. You will get an error and reported. as i found out when fiddling about with vista.
