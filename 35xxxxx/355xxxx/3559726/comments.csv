I am not real familar with making DVD copys but, the DVD plays fine on my PC but, when I burn it to DVD and try to play it off my home theater DVD I get a disk error.  Do I need to convert the files over first to a different format before burning to DVD.  Could someone please explain the process if possible.  Thank You for the seed it rocks."

,Video_Veg,2012-07-22T09:04Z,"Have always loved this movie but never seen the 'Directors Cut' before; so decided to see if it was still available after watching a related movie 'Taking Woodstock' on TV today. Was surprised and happy that it was; and came in very quickly too.
Thanks All - Will seed as long as possible."
