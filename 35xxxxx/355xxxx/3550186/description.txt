Please don\'t sell these... I hate those people.  I looked high and low to find these and make them freely available. The copyright is dead on these, but I don\'t understand the OTR community and why they find the need to sell stuff that is free.  I would understand if these people were only the people that originally sourced the material.  But it\'s not... it\'s 99% people that downloaded it from the net.  Screw you guys... 
 
Free the OTR!!  Please distribute freely and reseed!

X Minus One is a great sci-fi series.  I think some of the \"remakes\" are just copies in here so please excuse that, but otherwise this is the complete series.  For a couple of them  (Embassy), someone has spliced on the X Minus One opening to the old Dimension X production.  I\'ve included these just for curiosity\'s sake.
