Regedit32 - Cracked by Devoney

If you want to acces the registry but it is disabled by the admin you no longer get to see "Registry editing has been disabled by your administrator" but now you see "Registry editing has been enabled by Devoney's Cracking"

tested on windows 2003

Enjoy,
Devoney
