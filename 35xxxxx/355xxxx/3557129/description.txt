Excellent compliation of marijuana-related jazz from America in the 30\'s and 40\'s. 

Includes tunes such as \"Save The Roach For Me\" By Buck Washington.

I think this includes most of the tracks on the album \"Dope And Glory\"

22 Tracks. Enjoy.. and seed, if you don\'t seed it won\'t grow! :D
