FULL FULL FULL FULL 
How's that for clarity?
Also, why burn when you can load it with Daemon tools? Saves a CD, is quicker to get where you're going, and no errors! 
Serial is in the NFO, open it with Getdiz or something....Works SOOOOOO fucking nice! Great spam filter in Outlook, finally! "
,Raener,2006-11-13T11:54Z,"Works perfectly. Input seril in the .NFO file and install. I recommend doing a custom install as not every home user needs the extra programs.

,Buffy_TVS,2006-11-13T13:37Z,"this is not a genuine microsoft iso, i am not talking about the actual program, i'm just saying. 1st microsoft do not use bin images they use standard iso. second they don't use ultraiso to make them, the scene does that. this was made or at least remad using ultraiso 8.xxx
why ??? also microsoft has volume labels that show what the disc is, this does not.
there is no doubt this is a modified image, and if you say so what ? it works, ok i'm not here to argue, i just wish people would release true shit and if they DO modify it then just say so!! it's the faking that sux."
,Raener,2006-11-13T18:32Z,WTF Buffy_TVS? This is a torrent site. If you expect all that buy the damn release from MS!

,dsrs,2006-11-14T10:00Z,"this is no comment on the torrent itself, which is great. but i found a problem in installation. i have office 2003. in setup of 2007 i told it to remove 2003. but on two differnet machines i got an error message
""Microsoft Office 2007 Enterprise encountered an error during setup. The windows installer service cannot update one or more protected Windows files 
Then my 2003 outlook is fucked, because the map32.dll gets corrupted or changed by 2007. all you have to do is remove outlook 2003 [not fix or repair] and reinstall it and you are back to normal. but i cannot find on google any way to fix this problem of 2007 not installing ....
has anyone done this?
does it work if you first completely remove office 2003?

thanks again to poster of torrent"

It works!!!
for dsrs: I also have Office2003 installed previously. I just choose ""upgrade"" from the main option. Never have the chance to delete/uninstall my Office2003. it took quite a while to install though. The only things that Office2007 didn't upgrade are my Visio2003 and FrontPage2003."
,exodeus,2006-11-16T17:27Z,"downloaded... unrared the first rarfile and upon extracting the bin/cue from the second serie of rarfiles i get:

!

how can people say it works when there's no problem with my particular download since both bitcomet and winrar says OK on the first rarfile? but the second set fails crc?

i'm on a new system so i guess it could be some issue on my part, but personally i find that unlikely. just sharing my experience, if it works for you... great!"

i had serious problems trying to install
but can report it works perfectly now

if like most sane people you did not install xp on your system without using nlite to compact it and get rid of ms shit, you may find you cannot install this office 2007

you will get an error saying windows protected files cannot be updated

look in the event viewer under administrative tools on your start panel. read the message with red warning

it will tell you which file is the problem
in my case was fpault.dll
you need to find this file on your original xp cd, or download it, and copy it to the folder mentioned in the warning

in my case was prog files\common files\msshared\web extensions\40\bin

once you do that office will install fine

after that it is a question whether you want it. word is kind of ugly and overbearingly overloaded with crap"
,hailtome,2006-11-23T02:38Z,"FYI: I received a warning from my internet provider. Someone reported this torrent as copyright material. Therefore, someone is watching it.

,Beofres,2006-11-25T23:42Z,"Totally works.  Installed on Server 2003.

For the idiots & noobs that are just learning about torrents and .rar files:

1. Unrar
2. Read the.nfo file (right click and open in notepad if you don't have a 3rd party .nfo viewer like the cool kids do.
3. Go to wink-02k7e.rar  It's the only one that doesn't have .r## on it.  Right click and extract.
4. Using Nero or some other 3rd party burning software or a virtual drive, mount or burn the .cue

PROTIP:  You need both the .bin and .cue in the same folder to burn/mount the CD.

First double click the compressed file which will open it in winRAR..(i preffer this program so the instructions will pertain to it)

1. you will see a bunc of files from 00 up to 47 i believe..that is really irrelevant tho..just click them all then extract to whatever destanation folder you want.
2. once this is done click on the 00 file and press ""view"" on the top of the program. it will show a bin file..click on this and press extract.
3. it will cue you if you want to extract all files or just that one..press all the files. 
4. it will then give you an error saying a file is missing. click brouse and go to the file that you had extracted previously. 
5. you will see a one file in this folder press on it once and right click. press extract here. it will take another couple minutes to extract the file.
6. download daemon tools if you don't already have it.  right click on the dameon tool icon in your windows tray and go to the top to the drive E:
7. A drop down will pop up and give you the option of mounting. press ""mount""
8. a window will pop up just brouse for the windows file that you extracted and double click on it. 
9. all done the windows office window should open.. just enter provided Key and your all set..

It would be nice to have a torrent that has 2007 Office updates if this won't work."
,ukljk,2006-12-30T19:09Z,"Motorolan,

,holtky,2007-01-19T18:20Z,"Installing right now. Key worked well...
If you don't know how to use .cue or .iso, google 'mounting disk images daemon tools' or something."
,tg1789,2007-02-04T02:02Z,"Ok, I have been unable to get this to work, but I have been TRYING before I ask.

I have WinRAR.  I've downloaded this torrent.  I tried to follow someone else's directions, but it hasn't been working out for me.  I took a few screenshots to detail my issue:

http://i110.photobucket.com/albums/n97/TAYLORJNG/screenshot.jpg

Okay, that's what I had when I was down downloading.  

http://i110.photobucket.com/albums/n97/TAYLORJNG/screenshot2.jpg
http://i110.photobucket.com/albums/n97/TAYLORJNG/screenshot3.jpg

These are what I had when I opened WinRAR.

http://i110.photobucket.com/albums/n97/TAYLORJNG/screenshot4.jpg

This is what I had when I clicked on one of them.  Shouldn't the file be the same size as the thing that I clicked on?  Why does it compass all that I had downloaded.

If anyone can give me a step-by-step procedure on how to get this working, it would be greatly appreciated.

,ErikBooy,2008-02-28T18:56Z,"@ n2n, 

The reason for you .bc! extension is that you have downloaded the files using BitComet. BitComet automatically insert a "".bc!"" after every filename, if you have selected that option. If the extension is still there, then you have not completely downloaded the file yet..."
