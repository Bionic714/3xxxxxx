,Hobbish,2007-08-02T04:17Z,"I have the same problem, well actually i have 2.

First, the update doesn't work. It says:
""The update is only compatible with the english (US) version of F.E.A.R. Please use the correct update for the installed version of the game.""

I pressed ""ok"" and the install still said it had to restart my computer (it didn't install properly but had to do that anyway), so I thought maybe it maybe would work anyway. Well it didn't. Help!

And then i tried to install extraction point, and it said the same thing as the update said. 

Please, someone that has extraction point installed, HELP! Thanks in advance
