,IncubusAZ,2006-12-25T00:39Z,"Hey Sarre:
If you would rather have lossy mp3 then go somewhere else. This guy is nice enough to share his files and all you people do here is bitch when something isn't in a format you prefer. I prefer WMA over MP3 anyday! If you don't like it then don't bitch. At least this guy is sharing."
,IncubusAZ,2007-01-03T11:49Z,Torrent is stuck for weeks. Please reseed. Thanks for sharing! :)
,CDOGG,2007-01-05T23:12Z,"I agree with IncubusAZ, this guy is decent enough to put this up.Do a bit of searching for another format if you want it, don't whinge about the format."
