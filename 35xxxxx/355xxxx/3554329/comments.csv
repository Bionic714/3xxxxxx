,ripoweewee,2007-04-23T08:20Z,Don't bother with this one.  The Dixie Chicks are unAmerican and should be banned anyway.
,Distortion^,2007-07-20T15:45Z,"It's a good thing that they are ""anti american"", as they're probably the only ones that think we all should know the truth. USA and their stupid politics are just lies, and you really suck..."
,CandiedHaggis,2008-02-11T05:57Z,"Are You FKing kidding me?!?!  They are unAmerikan...so they should be banned?  You ignorant shits give the rest of Amerika a bad name in the eyes of the world!  Banning music you don't agree with is ten times more unamerikan than any mild anti-Bush-administration sentiments they may have expressed in their music.  You nazi fuck - ban yourself, shitbrain."
,dkba27,2009-11-29T01:18Z,"USA rocks get over it, you're just jealous."
,Rooster78,2011-07-05T00:41Z,"Um, what happened to 'freedom of speach' you americans are supposedly so fiercely prould of? Saying they are ""anti-american"" is extreemely close minded."
