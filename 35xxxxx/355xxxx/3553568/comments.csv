,guvnor_nutter,2007-02-06T21:34Z,"I've downloaded this eventually but there is something strange about the 2 large .daa files.

Ive mounted plenty of files from here before via poweriso or daemon tools but with these files while I can see them I cant actually select them and open/mount them. Also in explorer right clicking on them and selecting properties gives the response that ""The properties for this item are not available"" but these are the only files within the torrent that are like this and azureus says the entire torrent has been downloaded so I cant work out why I cant mount them to install the game.

Has anyone else had this problem with this torrent?"
,Lilloe,2007-02-10T15:23Z,"No problem installing the game, no problem starrting it, but just as I get on playing, when you follow the king and the guards down the stairway from your cell the whole computer suddenly restarts and I get a message there's something wring with my graphic driver!
