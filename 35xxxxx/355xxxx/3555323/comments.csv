,strangelove9,2006-11-19T21:34Z,"What's the source?
Is it pan-and-scan or widescreen?
What is the quality like?
Is it PAL or NTSC?"
,strangelove9,2006-11-21T03:58Z,"Dude, are you seeding or not???"
,strangelove9,2006-11-23T02:41Z,"OK... since the original seeder did not tell us more about the file... here goes:

It's a PAL .avi file, presenting the film in widescreen, the correct aspect ratio, BUT... the original English audio was replaced by a French audio track... which makes Anthony Quinn sound like Jacques Bonhomme... 

Hooray for posting, boo for the bad audio dubbing!"
,therion23,2007-11-21T15:17Z,"Anybody picked up this torrent?
