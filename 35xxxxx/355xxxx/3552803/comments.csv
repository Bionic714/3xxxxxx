But could somebody please SEED?"
,asp4dos,2006-11-10T00:24Z,"I cannot seed 24/7 ; it's a matter of life and...power bills; however I seed every day for a few hours; don't worry people, I won't leave u flat. I will seed it untill it passes 100% and afterwards only when it drops below that.

~end of line~"
,merlin_the_end,2006-11-14T03:54Z,"Thank you kindly for this masterpiece and promises of seeding when you can, asp4dos. It makes me happy. :)"

Recompressed to 500MB with nominal loss of quality.  If you prefer a low-bandwidth stream of poor quality content, go here. :)"
,asp4dos,2008-11-09T18:38Z,"dont forget that poor analog rips have a lot of noise, and in spite of some heavy filtering, the codec still tries to retain all the artifacts.

and if you don't give it a high bitrate, it will look bad.

anyway, this torrent is only temporary, until i find a proper DVD rip."
,Hymie1,2009-03-26T00:37Z,"I uploaded an alternative VHS rip if you guys want to check it out.
