Note:

this is a recoded version of the only available release of this movie I was able to find. It was very poor quality, having been broadcasted on television, recorded on VHS, mastered in MPEG-2 again. There were major issues such as bad image positioning, and short portions with white noise at the begining, not to mention temporal noise, especially in chroma. I've improved it as much as I could, but in the end you get a high-bandwidth stream of poor quality content.
Therefore, if you can find a torrent with a proper straight-from-DVD version, please post a link here.


Credo:

I believe artists should always be rewarded for the masterpieces which inspire us. However, in today's world, most of the profit goes to the studios/ record companies/ publishers. Publishers function as monopolies, and trash the rights of artists and consumers in order to maximize their profits, while they discourage content creation and render the access to information prohibitive to many people.

Intellectual property should be licensed, not sold. 

And information should be readily available to all, if we are to reach the stars.




Enjoy ;-)
