,speakeasy,2006-11-04T13:24Z,"Thanks for the post - looks good (IMDB 7.1)

Feedback:
An IMDB link is essential
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0222851/
And knowing the source / method is always nice.  E.g. Ripped my me from retail using DVDShrink at 85%"
,cr0tchg0bblin,2006-11-04T13:31Z,freakn aye thank you
,el_segundo,2006-11-04T13:54Z,"Sorry about the imdb thing will make sure next time.

Source is original retail disc ripped on DVDShrink all extras and menus retained. Not that there is that many. Not sure on th ecompression ratio but my test burn of the iso came out acceptably well."
,Araya,2006-11-04T16:26Z,Thank you el_segundo! Good work!
,apoptos,2006-11-06T06:49Z,"thanks for the upload...!
is it PAL or NTSC...?"
,el_segundo,2006-11-06T07:52Z,Original format is PAL
,el_segundo,2006-11-12T00:56Z,Well? Come on folks plenty of you have downloaded this so far. Comments re quality etc would be welcomed so that the next upload is better. Any requests for the next one? I have an extensive collection of asian and obscure movies.
,Heero14,2006-12-05T05:40Z,"Hey, El Segundo, thx for uploading this, but I need help. I downloaded this and burned the ISO on a DVD, but the only audio there is is English, there's no Japanese audio!"
,Heero14,2006-12-05T06:05Z,"Wait, sorry, never mind my problem. I thought this was a Japanese movie, but then I realized it was an English speaking movie and the subtitles are just for the scenes where the Japanese are speaking. Meh, you don't see that too often. You should specify it next time though, it's confusing. 

By the way, do you happen to have the movie GO (Japan, 2001) with the super hot Kou Shibasaki in your extensive collection of asian and obscure movies? I've been wanting to see that one for a long time but the one on Pirate Bay hasn't had a seeder for like a year! If you don't, then do you have Takeshi Kitano's Sonatine? Thank you."
,SQUEE!!!,2007-05-09T14:14Z,"first thanks for uploading this, it's a sweet movie, and i can't find it anywhere here. 
secondly if this is originally from PAL is there any way to burn it to a DVD and make it NTSC?"
,sanjuro_61,2007-09-14T02:17Z,"DVDShrink, oh god, it kills movies."
,sanjuro_61,2008-01-18T18:19Z,Goodbye seeds :(
,el_segundo,2008-01-28T20:30Z,Hey. Expermentally re-seeding this expired torrent. Let me know if there are any problems with the finished download. Cheers

,Free_mind,2008-07-28T13:16Z,Najs! Bra att n책gon sn채ll sj채l laddar upp. 5 av 5 toasters
,wulfeh,2009-08-02T21:16Z,"Could somebody seed? Right now 6 people are stuck at 87%. If I can finish downloading this, then I'll seed for a month."
,bignowhere,2011-09-29T18:23Z,Well dude I sure appreciate your words. How about a list of your extensive collection of asian and obscure movies.
