What George experiences beyond death is the focus of this darkly comedic series. It takes a slightly twisted look at life and at onepossible version of life in the after life. What if death is not the end? What if it is not even an escape from the issues that plagued us?What if it is not a way to avoid accountability, but an opportunity toaccept responsibility? What if it is a wake-up call?
