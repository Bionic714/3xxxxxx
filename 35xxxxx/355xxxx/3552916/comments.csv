Thanks thayk! :)"
,GaGaG,2009-08-14T19:39Z,"works fine, just follow the instructions, run install file, run LMSetup.exe (crack folder) and point it to the license.lic in the crack folder, copy this license.lic and the ARCGIS.EXE (from crack folder) into program files\ESRI\License\arcgis9x and follow rest of instruction. I am not sure if it is a bug or something but ""Check Start Server at Power up"" didn't work for me, I had to manualy start the service when i rebooted start>run type services.msc and browse the list for arcGIS .... and click start the service ... hoped this helped."
,jarawa,2010-05-16T10:50Z,"Hey Thayk, followed instructions but finally stonewalled at LMTOOLS. When trying to save service settings I get the message: Failed to Change FLEXIm Licence Server. You need to be an Administrator to perform this function.

Help please. Thanks!"

,hunter_ftw2,2011-02-16T10:03Z,"I had the same problem as jarawa, and im the admin on the computer... what have i ve done wrong?"
