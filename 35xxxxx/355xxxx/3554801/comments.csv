,patman666,2008-05-30T14:28Z,Has anyone been able to get the licenses working?
,ReasonsUnknown,2008-08-08T20:05Z,"The install files in this torrent used to work for me, but when I recently tried to reinstall the application, all it gave me was an ""UnexpectedException"" when trying to run the license manager.
Maybe the old installation wasn't completely removed or something.

TO THOSE WHO GET AN ""INVALID KEY LICENSE"" MESSAGE:
Learn to read the damn text file. If you're not even able to reproduce or anticipate such simple tasks you should defnintely not do any risk assessment..."

Thanks"
,matthewrbarlow,2009-07-12T20:03Z,"Thanks to the seeders, managed to download it.

One question, can find the ""BIN"" folder where you're supposed to unzip the crack to, does anyone have the full path?

"" Extract CRACK.ZIP to the /BIN""

Thanks "

C:\Program Files\Decisioneering\Crystal Ball 7\Bin
