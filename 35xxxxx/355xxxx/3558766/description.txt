Jay Weidner - Alchemical Cinema, 2012 the Odyssey
October 1, 2006
This is an incredibly exciting program with author and filmmaker Jay Weidner. We talk about his latest book \"Alchemical Cinema: A Search for the Spirit in Contemporary Filmmaking\", we go into Kubrick\'s 2001, Tolkiens Lord of the Rings, James Cameron\'s Terminator and Titanic. What are the messages in these movies, and are the directors and writers always aware of these messages themselves?

We also talk about the symbolism behind the events on 9/11 and his new film \"2012; The Odyssey\". So how does all this connect with 2012? This enigmatic year is only six years away... what does it all mean? Don\'t miss this program!
