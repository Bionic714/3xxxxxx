Microsoft Windows 2000 Unofficial SP5 combines 403 hotfixes into a single hotfix - fully automated. It\'s not just a matter of determining file versions, there\'s much more to it. The Microsoft Windows 2000 Unofficial SP5 interface is very easy to use since it\'s identical to a normal Windows update setup. Thank You  Gurgelmeyer & Softpedia ;-)
