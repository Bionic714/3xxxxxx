There are 
0 real chases
0 close calls
hundreds of red lights driven through
The exciting parts was when the film was fast-forwarded and somehow he misses a gear when he is driving slowly.

The driver has a really top notch BMW - carbon everything and the engine at the start does sound mean. He does get followed by 3 police vans, which must have a top speed of 60 and he passes some police volvos and drives so fast away they can't even begin to chase. 

If your interested in some good chases find Ghostrider, at least he lets the police catch up. If you like car chases find ghostrider 4. Theres a good one in there. I think GR3 has a Subaru chase


Sorry for the poor review, but this is rubbish"
,rayray360,2006-12-17T07:20Z,I'm inclined to agree with Mctart this video is shit

,encoded evil,2007-01-23T18:44Z,"this rocks!

respect to the driver(s)"
,encoded evil,2007-01-23T18:46Z,and i rather want getaway 8 instead of the cops catching these guys
