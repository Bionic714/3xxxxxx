,HangLoose,2006-11-17T08:59Z,"No seed for a week now, stuck on 75%"
,HangLoose,2006-11-18T10:35Z,"He don't understand, he say ""iam seeding waiting on others to do the same"" no one can seed , no one have 100% 39 have 75.3% , i have hang on to this from the beginning and i'm and all is stuck. i think many give up soon me too."
,HangLoose,2006-11-18T11:29Z,"What he not understand; ""if he don't superseed"" only seed up to 200% to for example 4 downloaders , no-one got moore than 25% , He the sourse have stop seeding loong time ago, now he's waiting for the other 4 to start seeding. he think 4 got 100% and quit.. if he start superseed now ""very soon there will be 34 seeders""."
,HangLoose,2006-11-18T11:51Z,"if he only seed up to 200% to for example 4 downloaders , no-one got moore than 50%...my counting was wrong but the thinking was right."
,0ldsch00l,2006-11-18T12:01Z,Yeah we still need a seeder. I'm stuck at 75.3 aswell. Would love to get this file.
,HangLoose,2006-11-18T12:45Z,"Counting for fun; if he start superseed now and he have uploaded already 200% (my example) he need to superseed (to be shure) at least 230% for the turrent to manage itself (if he is lucky) but count on, that all 34  when they finally get 100% already have seeding it maybe ""like me"" something about 500% and delete the whole thing after some hours.. i think the whole 75% thing is deleted, before he read this...still no seed !."
,HangLoose,2006-11-18T13:20Z,"Not very fun, but i give up this 75,3% torrent now. i need hdd-space

But I can't extract any of the files, I keep getting the following message :
