,brosee13,2006-11-05T16:47Z,"better yet, google ""jayteemaster ps2 utils""  for the pal2ntsc utility for patching. It works very well, and is simple to use.

,jennysalala,2006-11-06T15:03Z,I find jayteemasters pal2ntsc very sucky. It says it centers the screen but it doesn't. It should fix the refresh rate from 56hz to 60hz but it doesn't. So it turns your game to colour but the screen stays off-centered and it hurts your eyes because of the lower refresh rate.
