With Advanced Vista Codec Package installed, you shouldn't need to install any other codec or filter. Many user suggested default settings are implemented. This package does not contain a media player and does not associates filetypes. With this package installed, you will be able to use any media player to play DVD's, movies and video clips such as quicktime, realmedia, avi, mpeg, Flv, swf, wmv, etc. Streaming video can be played within web browsers. By default, you shouldn't need to make any adjustments to enjoy playback immediately.
