,Windowsvista,2006-11-13T11:42Z,"is this realese like all other vista realeses??
last one sucked! made by a stupid hacker ...!
good download´?? please feedback!"
,checkup,2006-11-13T11:43Z,"the biggest difference in AMD64 Mode is that you have about twice as much as registers (_additionaly_ to the fact that all registers are now 64 bit wide).

I'd say the speed gain is at least about 20-30%.

Linux in AMD64- SMP mode is much faster than uniproc x86-32 bit mode 
"
,FunkiBluDawg,2006-11-14T01:18Z,"Installed x64 version.
Thanks WinBeta, incredible work. !!"
,S-p-y,2006-11-14T04:07Z,Is this final or beta?
,kokoloupo,2006-11-16T02:51Z,"OK, it seems that most people using BitTorrent are stupid. I am seeding at my full upload bandwith whis is around 35 kB, and in spite that on the torrent there are more than 150 leechers and 15 seeders my download is only +-10 kB. It seems evident that most people are connected with his BT client misconfigured, firewalled, upload limited.... Please, could you read the help and configuration intructions of your software and set it right???"
,darkon11,2006-11-16T12:41Z,"What the heck is this?
I've installed it last night and there were no ways to get the net or the proper monitor resolution even with the vista ATI driver on.
With RC2 switching to right res. was automatic.
Is there someone who was able to get the WWW ?"
,S-p-y,2006-11-16T19:22Z,"THIS VERSION WORKING FINE (little problem with bootable installer) but:
1. noting works on it (AntiViruses, PS, nero)
2. games are much slower
3. all game using PunkBuster will not connect to any server (PB kick O/S not supported)
4. version will work only 3 days (need to activate)
5. version is not FINAL (uncompleted)
6. all GF 8800 will not work (no drivers)
7. GF 7XXX have only beta driver (crash some time)
8. many more :)

you are full of shit-you can only run the amount of ram that is compatable with motherboard you knob...

the difference is the applications you run you!

The methods described everyone don't apply to the 64bit version of Vista Ultimate:
Doesn't work on Vista Ultimate x64. The system is up and running, activation has been removed (windows is activated) but the damn watermark still exists.

I searched for all instances of user32.dll.mui and found several:

C:\Windows\System32\en-us\
C:\Windows\SysWow64\

and 2 backup locations. I applied the patched file to every instance but no go, the watermark is still there, sitting stubborn on the desktop. "
,the_reddevil,2006-11-19T02:41Z,"Has anyone managed to activate the x64 version of Vista Ultimate? The activation of this version does not seem to work. I have applied for and received a unique RC1 key. This key does not work.
I also succesfully replaced the tokens.dat and pkeyconfig.xrm-ms.
Help is appreciated."
,kokoloupo,2006-11-19T13:20Z,"Este torrent es una puta mierda. A pesar de haber decenas de sembradores va más lento que los caracoles.

Está claro que la mayor parte de la gente tiene el cliente bit torrent mal configurado, limitado en subida o tapado con el cortafuegos.

Cuidado que sé lo que digo, no es problema mío, otros torrents que he descargado bajan a 60 ó 70 kB y éste a unos miserables 20, 30 ó como mucho 40 kB.

Tíos sois unos cagados, no sabéis configurar vuestro sistema."

,kokoloupo,2006-11-24T12:54Z,"Yeah yeah yeah yeah... VERY VERY VERY VERY DIS-AP-POIN-TED, VERY D I S A P P O I N T E D.

NOT with this release though, but with this new Windows version.

It is amazing to see the current suicidal impulsions from Microsoft.

It looks like a combination of Linux SuSe 10 and the MacOS X but not at all neither of one.

Compared with WinXP and the very clear Win 2000 looks very clumsy. Configuration it's going a look like some Linux distributions. Though I had no problems in configuring networking and most hware I fear that the bulk of stupid Windoze users will face very serious trouble next months.

And the most offending issue is that after 5 years testing and debugging Microsoft has manage only to get a buggy OS that just after going out from the shops will need patching and patching and more patching.

As with Win XP surely after the first half year or so out from the factory will appear the service pack 1.

Probably this is a deliberate move from MS just to crackle on pirated copies and force all user to activate.

Nevertheless going into a Linux look like without beein real Linux MS it is realy going to muddle its traditional users.

Beware! some generic drivers WinVista installs are very buggy. If you intend to use your computer for serious work stay on WinXP or Win2000 by now and wait for events to come."
