Gothic Melancholy Vol.20 - Home made compilation by AssMaster
Released at The Pirate Bay

The last one! For now...

Thanks for all comments through this year, I know these
compilations has become quite popular :) But for now this
is the last volume, I'm currently a little bored with picking
songs. And frankly, I'm running out of good albums to pick from!

So maybe I'll continiue later on when I feel up to it, who knows? ;)

Also, I've quit seeding most of the volumes. I'm going to re-seed
volume 11-20 in one torrent later on when there's a demand for it
instead. Big torrents live longer!

See ya later...
