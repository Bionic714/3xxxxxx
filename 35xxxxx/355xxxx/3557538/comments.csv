,_Dradu_,2007-08-24T04:18Z,"Hey AssMaster, would you mind uploading the 11-20 Torrent?

Those torrents are alive, but barely, I've been trying to download them for a while, but with little success.

I love the comps you put together, and it would be greatly appreciated if you uploaded the 11-20 torrent soon, making it easier for everyone to download and experience all this music, rather than just the one or two comps that are well seeded.

Thanks for your time,

_Dradu_"
