The new expansion pack for The Sims 2. Pets!!

The Sims 2, is going to the dogs?and for that matter, to the cats, guinea pigs
and birds too!
The addition of a new friend is guaranteed to enrich the daily lives of your
Sims! Not only will players have the opportunity to choose from a variety of 
existing breeds, and hot designer mixes, but they ll also be able to personally
design their new friend with the Create-a-Pet feature. The ability to customize
gives fans the opportunity to create their ideal pet by choosing their body
shape, unique markings, even their pet?s personalities! With so many different
animals to choose from, there?s no telling what unpredictable experiences could
occur! 

Players will also be able to teach their pet new tricks, take them for a romp
in the park, outfit them with new pet accessories and even give them a job! As
in real life, your Sims? pet will require care and training. A neglected cat
with an urge to scratch might claw up your new couch if you aren?t careful,
and leaving your dog unattended near a freshly planted flower bed probably
isnt wise!
