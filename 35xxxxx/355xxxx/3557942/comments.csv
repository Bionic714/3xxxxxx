,Muflin,2006-11-15T10:43Z,ooooo now thats a program i need when i have done with these other downloads i will help ya for sure ^^ give me about 8 hours :S
,Muflin,2006-11-15T10:43Z,Also i have the free version of winrar but its an old version but still works
,elf240768,2006-11-16T08:10Z,Beware ! trojans detected in this file. Could not use my PC until I did a restore.
,black curtian,2006-11-16T22:39Z,"if there is, it was picked up from a seeder. I just scanned the original host files (.rar and torrent file) both are clean here. 

what did you scan with?

if it caused you to do a restore I would suggest you find another virus scan that will intercept it and not allow the infected file to complete downloading. I use Kaspersky, have had dozens of trojans come down with torrents, it cathes them out the gate and deletes them. I've noticed that most of them are in the keygen."
,Captain Kirk,2006-11-16T23:44Z,"This would not install as file atl71619A1c5B.dll was not installed - could not be found in 2DCDF6D4.cab
 ## This exact same error was reported in another Nero 7 torrent ## 

 This deletes version 6 , and tries to install version 7 demo .... but did not work on my system."
,black curtian,2006-11-18T18:06Z,"thats really odd capt,  because actually this torrent is one i downloaded, the original had 2 keygens one of which had a trojan and was deleted by my virus scan. 

it installed and runs great fine on my system so I just recreated a torrent for it minus the one keygen. as well i have noticed with Many torrents it's difficult to get all the files, maybe one seeder is haveing problems and others are not available, i've downed many albums that say 100% but then open the folder and one song is showing but is like 10 kb instead of 5 MB. this could be the prob.  

possible idea: 
did you uninstall nero 6 first? may not solve the problem but its a good idea to uninstall prior versions first unless just installing an ""upgrade"" package.

I just checked my copy and install proceeds fine.
in any case dude, sorry if you cant get it working, it's my first and i may have fucked something up. or I have noticed that a lot of torrents get ""corrupt"" along the way, i too have had the same type probs with others."
,kidoatmeal,2006-11-20T21:06Z,is this the demo or the full version?
,black curtian,2006-11-21T21:28Z,full
,black curtian,2006-11-21T21:32Z,"on install if i remember correctly it will state that it is installing the demo, but once u use the keygen and enter a registration number it becomes the full monte...just to be safe people uninstall any prior version of nero before installing this..this is a good habit unless ur installing an upgrade package which this is not"
