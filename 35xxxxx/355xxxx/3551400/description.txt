Fishmans (????????) is a Japanese dub pop/rock band formed in 1987. 6 In 2003, HMV Records Japan rated them #83 in their "Top 100 Japanese pops Artists. "If fishmans were categorized into a particular music group in Japan, it would be Shimokita-kei music as opposed to Shibuya-kei music. Their works still remain in the major music scene in Japan even 6 years after the singer passed away".
