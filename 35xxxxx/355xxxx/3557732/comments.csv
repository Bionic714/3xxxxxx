Back up everything you want to save on a removable drive and/or dvd-r's, make backups of your drivers, pop in the 2k cd, restart, pick your os, probably pro, delete partition c, create a new partition in the unpartitioned space, format with ntfs .....   that's the best possible way to install this OVER xp ;-)"

,Smokerillo,2006-12-28T08:21Z,"i have a seagate 300 gb ultra ata thats working great with it.. the disc wizard software that came with the drive quickly enabled support for drives larger than 128 gb. :)  in order to use a drive larger than 128 gb for the ""C:/"" drive the utility makes a bootable floppy that allows the install on it, enabling the support ahead of time. assuming most drive mfr's include a similar utility...."

yes, same cd but that is a .nrg (nero disc image)
this one is the ever popular .iso format, that you won't need nero or alcohol to burn. any burner will burn it :)"
,Tillion,2007-07-07T19:44Z,"Took 45min to download. Burned to CD without issues. Installed without issues. 

Good job, thanks!"
,DSMeTailer,2007-10-05T14:40Z,"I am unsure why, but I am having problems installing this.  I deleted my C drive partition, repartitioned it, formatted in NTFS, install went well, it restarted, then brought me back to the OS selection screen.  I tried the ""boot from HDD"" option, hoping it would continue installation in there, but got a frozen Win2K startup screen.  I restarted, then chose 2000Pro (same one I installed) from the OS selection.  It started the install all over again as if I hadn't done it in the first place!  I decided to reformat my C drive again, just in case.  When THAT installation was finished, it just did the same fucking thing to me again!  I know there is nothing wrong with this ISO, as you have gotten great feedback, so it must be something I am doing.  I have personally installed 98, ME, XP, Vista, and Ubuntu to machines in the past, and have never run into this problem.  Am I having a brainfart today, or is there something I need to do differently, this being a pirated version?  Thank you in advance to anyone who can help, I need that machine back up as soon as possible."
,Flying_Poo,2007-11-22T15:51Z,"I am getting an error during installation:

Windows 2000 could not start because the following file is missing or corrupt:
\system3ntoskrnl.exe

the file is there. could someone post and MD5 of their good working image so that I may compare mine to it to see if its just a bad download."
,Flying_Poo,2007-11-22T23:31Z,"NVM, I was trying to install it on a partition larger than 7.8GB. I re-partitioned to 7500 MB and all is well!"

,chabbe12,2007-12-11T18:39Z,Hey everybody! Just wondering if i should burn it to a specific cd for exampel CD-R 48 X????
,AlphaOmegaaaa,2007-12-31T14:35Z,"Win 2k is much better than xp. agreed.

apple is much better than windows alltogether. woohoo.

Now for the million dollar question. I have 3gb of ram and 900gb of hdd in my machine (1x500gb sata, 1x320 sata, 1x80 ide)

Will win 2k be able to use this hardware to its best ability? or will i lose disk space and will my 3gb ram be redundant.

oh boy, cant wait for macworld. Getting the new macbook January 18th ^^

Looking forward to an answer to the specs question"

,mwmoriarty,2008-03-21T17:22Z,"I am having a very hard time with the installation. I think the first problem was I forgot and had a memory stick in one of the USB pots and that was making it difficult for the installation with an unusual drive letter. I had to reboot and run the repair option a few times because it could not find the SP4 files. Finally, I got past that but now when it boots up from C: drive it requires a username and password but I never set one up."
,mwmoriarty,2008-03-23T11:11Z,Seems like that was the problem (having a memory stick in place and throwing off the drive letters). I started over with drive D: as the CD ROM and it all worked perfectly. Thank you Smokerillo for making this available to us all.

It did not show itself until i downloaded ie6 sp1 from microsofts website, after that they alll started to show themselves, i had a newly formatted hd, fresh install of win 2000 pro from this torrent and then the spyware appeared no other 3rd party software was installed which means it could have only come from this torrent."
