,SeHeh,2007-11-26T20:06Z,Truly beautiful and earnest!
,falcott,2008-09-14T11:16Z,"I thought I'd report back with an answer to my own question above: I was in Tiruvanamalai a few months ago and attended one of these chantings. It is a loose collection of spiritually minded souls, drawn from around the world by the presence of both Arunachala and Ramana, meeting together in a house in a village on the edge of the town. They filled the house, spilling out into the courtyard, some chanting, some meditating. Children playing and cows herded outside the walls. Beautiful."
,Zaldizale,2009-05-10T10:21Z,crappy quality: 128kbps; besides in mp4. The music is definitely by westerners. Otherwise ok. Thanks anyway.

,miracleminded,2012-03-19T21:31Z,"I have an inkling that this recording is of a weekly kirtan held by a talented and devoted sadhak, named Upahar, he spends half the year in Tiru,  this winter I was blessed to participate in several  sessions and get fully uplifted and drenched in the nectar of the heart, will download and confirm Hari Om"
