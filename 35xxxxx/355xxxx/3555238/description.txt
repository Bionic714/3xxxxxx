This is the .rar fix, for those of us who downloaded the corrupt version of
 
Superman.Returns.NTSC.DVDR-MPTDVD

Files:  
R12
R59
R72
R75 
R93(This one wasn't corrupt for me, but others have complained)

Copy/Paste these files into your Superman.Returns.NTSC.DVDR-MPTDVD download folder, 

and overwrite the old/corrupt files. Extract using winrar.
