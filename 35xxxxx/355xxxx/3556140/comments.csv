,saolinaso,2007-12-10T02:08Z,What's the bitrate for this music?
,funkymonkeypie,2008-01-08T02:39Z,"One album (I want you) is 128Kbps everything else is 256 or higher.  This is a sweet rip, fully and accurately tagged, all albums are complete and in separate folders.   

Thank you silent springs, this is how it's done.
