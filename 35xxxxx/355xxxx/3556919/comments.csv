It's worth the download. Anything to do with Postal is worth the download."
,klukman,2006-11-14T00:02Z,Indeed it is. This is just so Fucking awesome!!! :D
,Psykomanius,2006-11-14T18:49Z,Do this one need Postal 2 or ???
,phosphyre,2006-11-15T00:30Z,"Yes, it only requires Postal 2: STP. AW isn't necessary. 

Also congratulations on finishing ED, I can't wait to see what you guys made of it. "
,klukman,2006-11-20T00:43Z,When will your website be up again? And when will the chainsaw be available for AW7?
,markslo11,2006-12-09T08:11Z,I am scared to play on Singleplayer...so ..i will play multiplayer :)
,skoobydubie,2006-12-19T06:45Z,where do i find help on this? this game crashes right after the subway stops and you go into the bathroom where to mirror breaks. shuts down everytime. this game is so great. scares the shit out of me. better that the original.
,skoobydubie,2007-01-03T19:24Z,ok all. heres the scoop. the bathroom at the end of the subway is glitched. stay out. go to the control room with the guards key and keep killing zombies.
,skoobydubie,2007-01-04T00:01Z,i forgot one thing. thanks bio and tell your friends thanks also. i hope this new wave of game making catches on.
