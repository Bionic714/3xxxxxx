END OF THE BATTLESHIP \'YAMATO\'

This 20 min video is, not a documentary, partial clip ripped from a Japanese movie \'Otoko-tachi No Yamato\' released in 2005. (with homebrew subtitle in English)

On April 6th in 1945, a Japanese \'Yamato\', the largest battle ship in the WW2 period, leaved its home port \'Kure\' and moved forward for Okinawa. The last mission of \'Yamato\' and its 3,000 crew was a Kamikaze attack against the U.S. Armed Forces just landed in the small island located in the south end of Japan.
The day after, \'Yamato\' became the largest target for firing practice about 200 miles north of Okinawa. \'Yamato\' didn\'t have any guardian aircrafts.....crazy!
Its end was tragical, as you know, a tragedy is a comedy sometimes. More than 90% of the crew, most of them were teenagers, were killed or drowned.
