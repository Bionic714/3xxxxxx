,Osaka,2006-11-27T12:20Z,"I've probably asked this before, somewhere, but why do nearly ALL these videos have such low resolution? ""480x360"" for this one... Others have even lower.

And most of the rips of Alex Jones' documentaries that are out there are in 320x240 res and still 700mb! wtf! If the person who rips the stuff is gonna make a 700mb file then he/she can use higher resolution than that!"
