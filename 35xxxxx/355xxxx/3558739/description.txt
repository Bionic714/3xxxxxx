September 24, 2006 marked the first public event sponsored by Berkeley radio station KPFA regarding the alternative vision of the events of 9/11.

The panel discussion celebrated the publication of the book edited by David Ray Griffin and Peter Dale Scott titled ?9/11 and American Empire: Intellectuals Speak Out.? The book, published by Olive Branch Press (Interlink), contains eleven essays by American and international intellectuals. Ray McGovern, the host of the event commented that these writings ?in no way can be dismissed as the ravings of ?paranoid conspiracy theorists.??

The video of this landmark event publicizing 9/11 Truth, includes the complete presentations of each of four major contributors to the book: David Ray Griffin, Peter Dale Scott, Peter Phillips and Kevin Ryan plus question and answer moderated by host Ray McGovern. The audience?s standing ovation response to this standing-room-only event was tremendous.
