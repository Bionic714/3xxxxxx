,nonantroll,2009-05-27T10:41Z,"This is the best version, read by Arthur Addison.
Only question I have is if this copy is damaged.
I downloaded a torrent with the same size that had multiple occurences of glitches, splices, and fade-outs.
Can anyone comment on the quality who's listened to this download?
Thanks."
,tinpreacher,2010-08-23T19:29Z,"Same problem as nonantroll, multiple fade outs and skipping. Plus its cool that William Gibson read it himself, but he just drones on and on. If any other recording exists with a  professional reader, I would recommend it as opposed to this. "

This is not the version read by William Gibson (who reads much worse than this http://www.greylodge.org/gpc/?p=119 ), but by Arthur Addison, who's a book reader. "
