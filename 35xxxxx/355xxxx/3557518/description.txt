Synopsis
Captain Jean-Luc Picard and the Next Generation crew engage in their most thrilling adventure yet -a sci-fi action event that \"stands proud and apart\". They call themselves the Borg -a half-organic, half-machine collective with a sole purpose: to conquer and assimilate all races. Led by their seductive and sadistic queen, the Borg are headed to Earth with a devious plan to alter history. Picards last encounter with the Borg almost killed him. Now, he wants vengeance. But how far will he go to get it? Costarring Alfre Woodard and James Cromwell and bursting with spectacular special effects, Star Trek First Contact is one action film that \"has it all\".
