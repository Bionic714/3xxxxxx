     ¦ The planet of  Sproink was  bombarded  years  ago  by a giant ¦
     ¦ asteroid, & there was nothing that the poor inhabitants could ¦
     ¦ do but hide. They burrowed underground, creating caverns ben- ¦
     ¦ eath the  earth to re-establish their  civilization. It was a ¦
     ¦ major  undertaking,  but  they managed  to save  five million ¦
     ¦ Sproinklings before the surface was reduced to smithereens.   ¦
     ¦                                                               ¦
     ¦ It has been many years since, and now the little green aliens ¦
     ¦ have run  out of supplies. This planet appears  to have reco- ¦
     ¦ vered, so it is time to venture back to the surface & collect ¦
     ¦ the  food that  the beings  desperately  need. But  there's a ¦
     ¦ problem : the  caverns are  caving in. You  must clear a safe ¦
     ¦ path  for the  five  million Sproinklings. Are you  up to the ¦
     ¦ challenge ?                                                   ¦
     ¦                                                               ¦
     ¦ The road is arduous and there will be Sproinkling fatalities. ¦
     ¦ It  is nearly  impossible to save  all  of your  fellow green ¦
     ¦ aliens, so  you  must do  your  best to rescue as many as you ¦
     ¦ possibly  can. Along  the  way, you  will  encounter  several ¦
     ¦ obstacles  and  challenges that will  make your rescue effort ¦
     ¦ more difficult.                                               ¦
     ¦                                                               ¦
     ¦ In some stages, if not  enough progress is  made, your bridge ¦
     ¦ will rise  a level or  two. This gives you less space to work ¦
     ¦ with.                                                         ¦
     ¦                                                               ¦
     ¦ Don't bump  your head. If  the two  Sproinkets  operating the ¦
     ¦ cart hit  their heads on  the overhanging  crystals, they can ¦
     ¦ sometimes  cause an  avalanche. Many,  many stones  will fall ¦
     ¦ from  above, and  you will  have a difficult  time collecting ¦
     ¦ them  all before  they attack  your bridge. When  the  bridge ¦
     ¦ snaps, you lose a life.                                       ¦
     ¦                                                               ¦
     ¦ Rounded bridges can make aiming more difficult. The  angle of ¦
     ¦ the road affects the angle of your shot, so bare that in mind ¦
     ¦ when you encounter bridges that are bowed in the center.      ¦
     ¦                                                               ¦
     ¦ Special  items are  sometimes dropped  from  above by  flying ¦
     ¦ vehicles. Most of these are to your advantage -- giving you a ¦
     ¦ drill  tool, rockets, and  additional  bridge supports -- but ¦
     ¦ some can  be quite  detrimental. They  may narrow  your  cart ¦
     ¦ opening or damage your wheels. Be careful what you collect.   ¦
