,Churchills Dog,2006-11-05T10:32Z,"when Bush gets out of office, things will slowly go back to being normal. Islam always was and always will be based in intolerance of anything other than its own tenets. Someone draws a cartoon in another part of the world with rioting resulting and many deaths occur. Thats not a sane group....sorry.

There is no God folks. Just use simple logic."

Fucking idiots, if Muslims really were like this, how come the only aggressor at this moment is America. The Arabs have more than enough money to buy the world. No need to fire missiles."

This is done through religion, class war, politics...you name it.

,stam61,2007-04-20T18:18Z,"To all the Muslim people on this thread who are swearing and wishing violence on others you should be ashamed. Our religion (Islam) teaches us to be peaceful, tolerant and to respectful to others whether they are Christian, Buddhist, Jewish, Muslim or any other religion.

To non Muslims in this thread, please understand it is not our religion that teaches hate and violence, I doubt any of the worlds major religions do. 

It?s ill informed people in our religion who might feel committing politically driven violence in the name of our religion is justified. This is not true Islam and majority the Islamic leadership in today?s world should be ashamed of themselves, they certainly are not leading by example.

Muslims in parts of the world who have forgotten the basic teachings of our religion need to take a refresher course. 

And do not bash American, English or other western countries people in your discussions, sure some of their politicians might not make decisions that you agree with, but this does not mean the general population feels the same way. "

,captainmalon,2007-12-23T12:55Z,"Instead of watching this or fox news to learn about Islam, why not read some of the Koran?

Yea, there are quotes in this documentary, but there are quotes you can take from Christian and Jewish holy literature promoting violence as well.

I would argue that the violence displayed is cultural, not religious.  I think we can consider the US a primarily Christian nation.  The US homicide rate for 2004 was 5.5 / 100,000 inhabitants.  The homicide rate in Iran was 2.93 / 100,000.  In Pakistan in 2000 it was 6.86 / 100,000.

Is the west so violent because Christianity preaches violence?  Or is it our culture.

I am not a Muslim or a Christian -- I am just reasonable.  If you really believe something then think for yourself, do a little research on your own.  Whatever your religious beliefs, be more than the receptacle for whatever televised word-vomit is spewed in your direction."

,thamonindew,2008-02-05T23:14Z,"I'm a documentary filmmaker who's Jewish. I know some of you simpletons out there are expecting me to back this film because ""Jews hate Muslims and they're bitter enemies"" Of course, you simpletons have probably never met neither a Jew or Muslim in your life, hence why you think this film is anything but a complete hack-job.

This is a doc for people who have already made up their minds that ""Islam is evil"" and ""Muslims are our enemy"" without actually studying Islam in an objective fashion (reading evilislam.com doesn't count as objective, sorry)

It is the Islamic version of those anti-semitic films most of us Chosen Folks are familiar with that are produced by Neo-Nazi groups. It takes quotes from the Qu'ran completely out of context (ie - it quotes the Qu'ran as saying ""Jews (in general) are apes"" when in fact this passage is from the Islamic version of the book of Exodus, and that passage is talking about the Jews who practiced idolotry while Moses grabbed the ten commandments from the top of mount Sinai, if you wanted to, you could do the same hack job in the bible - you could say that since the bible tells the same story and refers to those specific people as ""heathens"" than the bible is saying that all Jews are heathens . . .

Expect this level of terrible scholarship or outright distortion from this film. Either the makers are completely ignorant of Islam (in which case, as a filmmaker, what the hell are you doing making a film about subject you don't know anything about?) or they're DELIBERATELY misleading their audience (again, what kind of a doc-filmmaker does that?)

The speakers are horrible as well:

Walid Shoebot - Was a Jew-hating Palestinian terrorist, before he switched sides and became a Christian and re-directed the same hate towards Muslims. In fact, much of what he says about Muslims now is similar to what he said about Jews in the past. Considering he hasn't been deported or charged unlike other Palestinian terrorists found living in the US, his new views seem to be keeping him in Uncle Sam's good books, which makes you wonder how sincere he's being, or if it's an act to stay out of jail.

Robert Spencer - Takes the worst examples of Islam, leaves out anything positive (and yes, sorry, there is much positive), takes quotes out of context - pretty much writes about Islam the way the Klan writes about Jews. But since it's publicly acceptable to be racist towards Muslims, unlike us Jews, he is able to make a joke of a career out of his amateur scholarship.

Bat Ye'Or - A good scholar of Jewish history in Muslim lands, however she doesn't keep things in context in making judgements such as ""Jews were treated like crap in Medieval Islamic countries"" - As bad as it was for Jews in say, Morocco in 1600, it was a hell of a lot better than being a Jew living in Christian Europe at the same time. After all, my family had to flee Spain to what is now Poland once the Moors were driven out by the Catholics, because of the Inquisition, which killed Jews who wouldn't forcibly convert to Christianity. So if Muslims are evil towards Jews because of this history, why not Christians? The answer is we should realize that the world IN GENERAL was anti-semetic for us and still is in many places, and up until after WWII for the most part, the best place to live for a Jew was a place like Seville in Moorish Spain, or Istanbul under the Ottomans.

These are the kinds of speakers in this film. A film that if it treated Judaism the way it treats Islam, would certainly be called an false, anti-semitic piece of propaganda.

If you really want to learn about Islam, go pick up no god but God by Reza Aslan (you've seen him on the Daily Show & Colbert Report, he is the Middle East expert for ABC News) great book written by a young guy who actually has degrees in and has taught religion. And an excellent writer as well."
,rockstar11998,2008-04-11T00:57Z,"I am a good sport about Islam all in all.  I just watched a video called ""Islam: The Light Illuminating the World"".  It was a great portrayal of what good Islam has brought to the world and how advanced a culture can get when it is founded on good principles.  They do claim tho that it was the most advanced culture on earth at the time.  That is either an uninformed statement or a deceitful one.  Has anyone ever heard of the Incas and Mayans??  I sure have, and guess what they were equally advanced if not more so.  So if they weren't Muslims what were they and where did their light and understanding come from?  I can tell you but you'd need an open mind.  They had calculated astronomical and scientific things that would make your head spin.  They even conducted brain surgery.  That's pretty darn advanced I'd say.  Well, I know of a book of scripture that explains how this can be but you may not like to hear its source(hint it's not Satan).
I forgot to tell you where I saw this video.  It was from y o u t u b e.  It was labeled fitna - the movie or something like that tho.  It was in 5 parts. I just looked again after watching it and there is the correctly labeled version there too.  I find this video great at telling the peaceful times and tolerant times but never does it quote any of the negative passages of the Koran or tell the mean things they did.  I guess it wouldn't go along with their wonderful title."
,rockstar11998,2008-05-30T07:17Z,actually at the outset Muhammad didn't want to hurt anyone or force religion on people but persecution and Satan led him to follow a more violent path.  He had good intentions but Satan knew he could use Muhammad to cause war and spread false doctrine throughout the world.
,rockstar11998,2008-07-06T01:43Z,I found a great site for showing how bad Muhammad was.  The name of the site is Prophet of Doom dot Net.  The author wrote a book of the same title but he put it all online for free so that everyone could be informed how bad Islam truly is.
,rockstar11998,2008-08-06T17:40Z,zarap21 - So that's how righteous people talk??? You have me all confused.  You have the spirit of Satan when you speak like that.  Islam = Satanic worship.  Want proof?  Just watch a video by Walter Veith entitled The Islamic Connection.  Have a nice day.
