,rus0,2006-12-04T16:27Z,"I don't know if this one is real, I bought the DVD, and it is well worth it because the bouns-material at the end of the DVD has updated information for what has changed since 2005 and things have gotten much worse.

And for those who don't believe in it, and prefer to take the cowardly reaction of ""climate change"" ignore this shit, you are FUCKING IDIOTS, and when the glaciers begin to cover the earth, you will be running and crying to the government to do something--- but it will be too late and it will be YOUR FAULT, and will result in the death of you, your children, and everyone and everything else."

,BasilBrush,2007-01-13T09:20Z,A very good presentation of the facts.
,JazonX,2007-02-10T13:12Z,"Propaganda.

Global warming is a fraud used by the globalists to push for the North American Union and ultimately a one world government. 

They're even saying now that the ""solution"" for this fake problem is a ""Global Tax"" and global economy. (Which means the end of all sovereign nations)

How stupid do they think we are?

... If you want to see a documentary about REAL things, download ""America - Freedom To Fascism"" or ""Terrorstorm - A History of Government Sponsored Terrorism"", or ""Martial Law 911: Rise of the Police State""...

Anyway, on the issue of global warming again, in reality, the core of the Sun is heating up, like it always has - from time to time - but now more rapidly than ever before, and it's effecting ALL planets in the solar system. Your SUVs have NOTHING to do with it.

There's a difference between real science and popular beliefs."

Are you a scientist? If not then you have no grounds to comment. Yes the sun is heating up, in billions of years it will become a white dwarf. Global warming is a scientific FACT, and our carbon emissions are causing the problem.

No I haven't been brainwashed by the film, I am yet to see it.

You are nothing more than a Conspirator. Try taking some Lithium!"

Do a google search on the solar system heating up.  Many places in our solar system are experiencing extreme unexplainable increases in temperature.  

Just because you can't believe what someone says or don't understand what somebody is talking about doesn't mean they aren't making sense.  It could be you that is lacking.  "

,oldngrey,2007-10-17T18:13Z,"This film would make a great prestiage if it would tell you the truth about global warming , it's quick flashing scenes and ill begotten music gave me a sense of forboding and doesn't not help to convey a sense of workable energy alternatives, this film made me feel helpless and depresssed. Much of the film is with Al Gore without anyone really backing up his views , it is like a big ego trip.My conclusion is if you want a pure disaster horror film then this is the one for you, but if you want a unbiased view of global temprature change then look to the bbc horizion documentary about global climate change. the nobelprice has lost all of his meaning and prestige since Al Gore got his. If anyone believes that humans causes global warming is either ignorant or having an agenda. Al Gore does have an agenda, look at his new company which buys and sells carbon credits, instant money for nothing.The ""Greener"" religion just doesn't standup to Scientific facts. Al Gore would sell his mother for a little feel good publicity. Alfred Nobel is probably rolling in his grave over what the Nobel prize become. The Nobel Peace Prize had lost it prestige long ago when it was given to Arafat, the father of modern terrorism.

The nine alleged errors in the film
# Mr Gore claims that a sea-level rise of up to 20 feet would be caused by melting of either West Antarctica or Greenland ""in the near future"". The judge said: ""This is distinctly alarmist and part of Mr Gore's ""wake-up call"". He agreed that if Greenland melted it would release this amount of water - ""but only after, and over, millennia"".""The Armageddon scenario he predicts, insofar as it suggests that sea level rises of seven metres might occur in the immediate future, is not in line with the scientific consensus.""

# The film claims that low-lying inhabited Pacific atolls ""are being inundated because of anthropogenic global warming"" but the judge ruled there was no evidence of any evacuation having yet happened.

# The documentary speaks of global warming ""shutting down the Ocean Conveyor"" - the process by which the Gulf Stream is carried over the North Atlantic to western Europe. Citing the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the judge said that it was ""very unlikely"" that the Ocean Conveyor, also known as the Meridional Overturning Circulation, would shut down in the future, though it might slow down.

# Mr Gore claims that two graphs, one plotting a rise in C02 and the other the rise in temperature over a period of 650,000 years, showed ""an exact fit"". The judge said that, although there was general scientific agreement that there was a connection, ""the two graphs do not establish what Mr Gore asserts"".

# Mr Gore says the disappearance of snow on Mt Kilimanjaro was directly attributable to global warming, but the judge ruled that it scientists have not established that the recession of snow on Mt Kilimanjaro is primarily attributable to human-induced climate change.

# The film contends that the drying up of Lake Chad is a prime example of a catastrophic result of global warming but the judge said there was insufficient evidence, and that ""it is apparently considered to be far more likely to result from other factors, such as population increase and over-grazing, and regional climate variability.""

# Mr Gore blames Hurricane Katrina and the consequent devastation in New Orleans on global warming, but the judge ruled there was ""insufficient evidence to show that"".

# Mr Gore cites a scientific study that shows, for the first time, that polar bears were being found after drowning from ""swimming long distances - up to 60 miles - to find the ice"" The judge said: ""The only scientific study that either side before me can find is one which indicates that four polar bears have recently been found drowned because of a storm.""That was not to say there might not in future be drowning-related deaths of bears if the trend of regression of pack ice continued - ""but it plainly does not support Mr Gore's description"".
