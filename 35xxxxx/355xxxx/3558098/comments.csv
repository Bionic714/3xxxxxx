,Magnulus,2007-11-27T15:46Z,I'd be really grateful if you'd seed for a little while. I promise to keep seeding afterwards. ^_^
,Magnulus,2007-11-27T17:35Z,Actually... You can get this one from Home of the Underdogs. No need to seed or download.
,bbglee,2007-12-07T06:17Z,Please reseed!
,countersweet,2007-12-25T19:51Z,the one on the underdogs is a rip. this is a full iso. btw i have heared that the real full versino had also cd tracks on it. that one is a little bit bigger than 110.2MB though =/

,Davidos3012,2008-06-08T14:20Z,"For christs sakes SEED this.

This game used to be better than Quake till it got fixed.

Besides, the underdogs has a very crappy demo-rip version of the game and it's not even worth downloading not having sounds, music or cutscenes what so ever.

So seed this so I can finally start seeding cause I can't leech and seed at the same time now can I? -.-"
,Gogi113,2008-07-14T01:38Z,"Can anyone seed it please?
I could not found it anywhere else."
,empSokol,2008-08-27T12:46Z,"It's ukraine programming group ""Action Forms Ltd.""
Somebody know, is it this game for(?) russian language?"
,Svento-92,2008-11-29T20:26Z,It seems to be a 16bit game and does not work for me
,Arsonist941,2009-02-01T14:35Z,"Ive spent soo much time tying to get this to work.  I own the game and tried the torrent version,
Dont bother downloading if:

You have windows xp or vista or 7 beta
You have a video card thats fairly new

A program that emulates dos in windows xp/vista is shit for this.  It works only sometimes.    

If you wanna try it anyway do a search for 
""dosbox""
and
""cpu killer"" 

dos box emulates dos and cpu killer slows down your processor so their is a small chance that the game will run.

A lot of windows 95 games still work but this game and redneck rampage are the WORST for xp/vista."
,Arsonist941,2009-02-10T18:23Z,finnally got it to work.  Windows 95 and 98 doesnt install onto most computers made after the year 2000.  I got windows ME to install on a somewhat new computer.  Dont try windows 2000 or xp or vista they wont work as said before.  Download a windows me torrent. 
,keneticst,2009-06-27T13:15Z,"Thanx heaps to those who are seeding this!
I just remembered this game & was suprise to see I could still get it.

BTW I have been running Blood in windows 7 using dos box it came with in the torrent. I have it setup so I just run a shortcut & dosbox runs full screen 800x600 & loads the game.

I found that
Output=DDRW setting in the config ran a lot smoother than any other setting.

I also told DOSBOX to use more ram.
(default is 16mg)

Try the same settings for chasm n let me know if it works.

Oh & keep seeding please! My net speed is capped for a while."
