,skowfritt,2006-11-11T22:10Z,Forget this. Get the 5600 reset app with the isohunt.com torrent. The reset will kick in every time you reboot. This works with 5600 and 5744 and presumably will with 5840 as well.

,F@TMAN,2006-11-12T06:06Z,"Any1 confirm using ultimate with ReeBSaW's crack? And what's wrong with this release, iSEPIC?"
,lap87,2006-11-12T06:43Z,"This works perfectly, even if you didn't enter a key when you installed it, i've tried and it's confirmed. Just follow the instructions and you are fine. i had to vary on point 2 and 4 since it wasn't exactly the same as described, do a search for tokens.dat and you'll find it.


a tip tho, get ahold of a RC1 key NAOZ! seems like this crack together with a valid key will last a long time.

btw, i'm proper.. forget about everyone else, nuke em' bastards! :P

,F@TMAN,2006-11-13T04:53Z,"using the WGA kill trick, as long as you enter a valid (non-beta) cd-key, should this do the trick?"
,Idolsys,2006-11-13T06:07Z,"Yes this trick works and you can use your Beta keys to activate and update. You MS types posting virus warnings how about going back to work and figure out how to write a secure OS instead of spending time online trying to scare people. Had you wrote a proper activation scheme it couldn't be hacked within two days.

You will get the eval tag on the bottom right of the desktop, haven't tried hacks for that yet."
,anastasia_bt,2006-11-13T08:04Z,"as for the question of what cannot be ran...

I cant get any type of emulation software or even a burning software on here...

whats hilarious is that... you need a DX9 video card to burn a DVD no matter what type of DVD you choose to burn.

as for DVD playback, recommended you use a 3rd party player (still) otherwise you get horrible interlacing tare and glitchin playback. (in both WMC and WMP).

Foobar2K crashes constantly...

I'll let vista mature, and also let app dev's play catchup so their software works."
[V],jnd,2006-11-13T23:59Z,"Hmm, so what happens when MS disables all pre-release keys on their activation servers? Or starts considering them invalid for the WGA checks? I think it's bound to happen at the moment Vista officially appears on MSDN."

,skowfritt,2006-11-14T03:31Z,Quite so. you must apply the MSDN patch to the BillGates iso.

No-one knows what to do, if it wven works, and for how long it may eventually work if they get it installed :D

This all because this is no crack in any way, this is some cheap activation trick. Do not install a pirated version if you want your computer to stay functional. Wait until someone comes out with a crack that will activate windows fully and present your copy of windows as legitimate. Sadly this is not going to happen, because they did not manage to get it to work with winXP either.

Admit your loss, Microsoft has finally done the OS that won't be used pirated. Sad But True.

I'm off for the shop to buy Vista as soon as it comes there. I want to enjoy the new features of vista and my dx10 ready machine."

,maibayar,2006-12-15T03:32Z,I can't download these files. pls help me by step by step to download.............
,andi968,2006-12-17T12:04Z,"Microsoft  released a security patch yesterday that stops this crack from working...However heres a way round the patch

1 Place your RTM copy in CD and set it running 
2 Select Repair previous installation
Then same as before :            
Browse to Windows\System32\Licensing\pkeyconfig' folder,right-click      
     'pkeyconfig.xrm-ms' Open property, click Security > Advanced > Owner >    
      Edit > Administrators. Click OK and close the propertes.                 
      Then re-open properties of the file, Click Security > Advanced > Edit >  
      select Administrators and click Edit.                                    
      Click ""Full Control"", Click OK and close the properties.                 

   3. Reboot into safe mode                                                    
      Replace 'pkeyconfig.xrm-ms' using the one in this package.               
      Go to Start > Run > type ""services.msc"" and find ""Software Licensing"".   
      Normally this ain't running, but if it is                                
      you need to stop it with the stop button above.                          

   4. Goto Windows\ServiceProfiles\NetworkService\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft    
      \SoftwareLicensing                                                       
      Replace the tokens.dat from this package with the one there.             

   5. Reboot into normal mode again.                                           
      Go to Start > Help & Support > type ""Activate"" in the search menu.       
      Click on the third topic ""Activate Windows on this Computer""             
      This will start Windows Activation.                                      

   6. Now here will start the other part. I can't give you a working key,      
      and this is why: The 2 files you have replaced earlier, are patched      
      from an earlier Beta release. You need a Beta1/Beta2/RC1/RC2 key to      
      Activate it succesfully. Since any beta/rc key would only work 10 times  
      to register & activate Vista, you will have to get your own key.         

      And this is the funny part: Microsoft still allows anyone to get a beta  
      key. The only thing you need to do is login with your passport.net       
      account and you'll get a vista beta key which will work on this final    
      RTM release with the patched files.                                      "
,Windowsvista,2006-12-17T17:22Z,"what a hell are you talking about!? it doesnt work microsoft can this trick now...!! we need a keygen or some other crack..! The beta key you get does not work! ANYMORE! UNDERSTAND?
when you activate with the betra key microsoft understand that it is a beta version of vista so this does not work anymore! another crack please!"
,staub,2006-12-18T16:03Z,"Hey, guys. 

First of all, this activation crack seems to work just fine. Windows activated for me without any problems.

I've got an old serial, so to speak, all the way back from Beta 2. If you also had one, and lost yours, i recommend that you make a search in your inbox for a message from service@microsoft.com or something like that.

You could also try to hack into my hotmail account to get mine (I think I've got a few uses left on it). 

Either way, as long as you have a proper key for Beta 1/2 or RC 1/2, you'll be able to activate Windows Vista Ultimate. 

Now I don't know wether this stops working after 60 or 90 more days, I've heard that somewhere. But hey, if a proper crack hasn't come by then, I reckon MS are worth their money for this.

Finally, just follow the NFO (and use about 12 % of your brain power) and you'll get this working in no time!"
,huge321,2006-12-19T02:31Z,"Maybe I'm missing something on the lastest crack to Vista... When I put in my Vista rtm disk, there is no option to repair a previous install. Please advise... Thanks"
,stabbypagina,2006-12-19T04:35Z,"The following steps still work fine:

I went to the site in the NFO ( http://emocut.com/uh ) and got a legit serial for the RC.

Followed the steps in the NFO (I did NOT need to enter repair mode), clicked activate, got this:

http://www1.imgload.com/uploads/568e26f8e7.png

Activated! However, you DO get an approximately 180 day evaluation version. After installing, go to Start->Run->winver to see how long your key will be valid for. I'm sure somebody will release a key/crack by then. Here's what it looks like:

Click on restore system to an earlier date.
