,NICKE7,2006-11-08T17:00Z,is it version 1.2? or 1.0?
,HangLoose,2006-11-11T04:03Z,Looking like he blocks everyone before it is complete (the seed stopping so i never gonna get it complete) looks like a trick from relentlesstech.
,HangLoose,2006-11-11T05:00Z,"sorry my complain !. it was a bit slow at the end but now it's complete 200% , if it's a trick it's a good one. Thank's"
,ursak,2006-11-12T15:54Z,"Na it works. But if I try to start first lap in first race, it gives me an error and shuts down. Same if I skip först race and start with the second. There I can finish the first 2 levels (of 3) but the third gives the same error message. (Zlib -3: fatal error) and shuts down. Its possible to play all laps as just single race, and do all the stunts. But its not worth it without being able to do the circuit.."
,neveszerg,2006-11-30T00:46Z,"I got the same error!!!!  (Zlib -3: fatal error) 

Any know solve????"

,Garfen,2007-06-12T21:04Z,"It's only a white screen, when I start it? How do i fix the problem?"
,cebe_123,2007-07-09T18:32Z,What's the problem! I get that fatal error and im getting pissed! Fix it or something!
,jared1221,2007-07-19T20:01Z,"The Zlib error apparantly has somithing to do with unpacking the files during installation. Mine happens each time it tries to load any of the ""Pinegrove""-tracks. I've searched a bit online and found that sometimes it helpes if you reinstall while mounting it differently. I used Daemon tools so now I'm downloading Nero Imagedrive and will try with that. "
,tomban,2007-08-20T19:22Z,fucking fatal error this is waste of time

,Floyd311,2008-11-27T16:42Z,"** For all who have encountered ZLib fatal error **

Qlhund's solution works fine.
Download this tool:
http://flatoutjoint.com/index.php?option=com_remository&Itemid=27&func=fileinfo&id=115

And then

1. Copy bfs2unpacker.exe & zlib1.dll to a FO2 folder
2. Run it from commad line as shown:
    bfs2unpacker.exe fo2a.bfs
    bfs2unpacker.exe fo2b.bfs
    bfs2unpacker.exe fo2c.bfs
3. Delete or rename somehow .bfs' & ""filesystem"" files
4. ??????????
5. PROFIT!!!!!!!

Now all Pinegrove tracks won't kill the game."
,brunolee,2009-12-02T17:28Z,"help!!!!!!

NO THANKS TO YOU!"
,MÃ©szÃ¡ros Lajos,2012-01-22T18:44Z,"I cannot get it installed under windows 7. It doesn't even start to copy the files to any folder I specify. What a shame :(
Windows 7, go fuck yourself..."
,pirat-no1,2012-05-26T19:35Z,"for those who cant make the installer copy over the files (i guess its a windows 7 or 64 bit thing)

just copy Empire InteractiveFlatOut2 folder as its that folder the installer copies to your harddrive

this also means that it can be done this way if you just dont want to run the installer"
