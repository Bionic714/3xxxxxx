,eKIK,2007-01-11T08:48Z,"Possible virus warning on this one.
AVG detected a Logger.Agent.ajy in Torque1.5\bin\nasm\nasmw.exe.

I haven't confirmed if this is a false alarm or not, but thought I should give you a heads up."
,ZRoot,2007-01-18T20:17Z,"this thing needs a crack??? because i really need a complete good game engine, fully working...."
,mmeltdown,2007-02-15T09:50Z,"As little value as my assurances can provide, I am willing to stake my reputation that this file was not seeded with a virus or spy ware. I am not a cracker nor do I claim to be. If this file is corrupt then you can thank Garage Games. In the mean time however, remember that all files I provide are taken from third parties. All I do is place them in convenient distribution file sets. I would like someone to scan it and post a final verdict if possible. "
,Nabarun,2007-02-19T21:05Z,"Final verdict from me (after too long, sorry!) is that AVG is sh1t and this upload is as clean as you can expect GG's files to be.

NO VIRUS OR ANY MALWARE!
100% WORKING!"
,Nabarun,2007-02-19T21:12Z,"final verdict from me is that this file is 100% clean and working 100%
AVG is sh!t !!!"
,xitars,2007-03-05T19:01Z,Anyone know if TGEA has been cracked (the newest version)?

,FatBoyZ2,2007-03-11T18:56Z,please seed
,mmeltdown,2007-03-12T05:24Z,"I do not want to take the time to seed it, but if their is enough to demand I will. I have the final release of TGEA and I will post it if there is enough demand for it. Send me an email at michael.derickson@gmail.com. Don't use a real email or your home IP if your privacy conscious. "
,mmeltdown,2007-03-19T00:49Z,"I seeded TGEA, please search accordingly"
,ANovella1,2007-03-21T00:12Z,Yo is this just a demo?
,bleeeaaarrrg,2007-03-24T05:43Z,"Great job guys, if you're only interested in sharing demos that are available directly from the garage games site. I really do appreciate your efforts however insignificant they may be. I think people are actually looking for fully functional cracked versions or else they would get these same files, without the worry of second hand contamination, from the vendors website."
,mmeltdown,2007-03-27T20:46Z,"This is not a demo. This is the whole engine. The demo application is the included precompiled engine with demo content to illustrate the engines power. If your not a programmer this is no good for you, because the demo allows you to do EVERYTHING this full version does, minus having the source code. 

If you don't know what your talking about, ask. If you don't know what your talking about, research. 

STFU and enjoy the program. "
,RobinK,2007-04-12T23:08Z,"Thank you very much, Mmeltdown.

Which license is this? I mean is it Indie or Commercial?"
,mmeltdown,2007-04-18T00:08Z,"License only dictates what you can do with it. For example, in this version you can remove the GG logo in the beginning through the source if you so choose. But like all game engines... if you end up publishing your title, you will need to purchase a license for it, otherwise your asking for a lawsuit. 

It isn't that expensive, but having it now will allow you to develop for it now, and pay for it later. It is like layaway. "
,Fishyx,2007-05-09T03:04Z,how can i enjoy this crap when all i can do is watch a demo!?!? How am i supposed to create a game with this crap? Don't upload crap please
,mmeltdown,2007-05-12T03:46Z,"FishyX: Again, your a stupid mother fucker. Instead of ripping on people who actually know what they are doing, perhaps you could read a tutorial or ask someone. This is, as was the TGEA, a complete copy of the source code, demonstration application and the precompiled engine. 

Go die. "
,Fishyx,2007-05-19T02:28Z,"Nvm i found out! D=

P.S. i dont want to be emo ... its scaries..."
,gstavskater,2007-05-25T20:31Z,Please seed thanx
,devinsmetzer,2007-09-10T00:51Z,Ok so I'm a noob let's not post comment discussing this fact. But I've download the torrent and I'm trying to figure out how to use the program. From what i understand I need to compile it from the source code? I'm using windows so i would have to compile it with cygwin right? Where is the source code? Or am I completely making this harder than it actually is. 
,tlchack5,2007-09-17T00:51Z,Anyone know were I could find a torrent for the Unreal Engine 3??? I wanna do a kick ass first person with a map I have conjured and none of these other engines have done it justice...
,tlchack5,2007-09-17T00:55Z,"Well... I figure I must make the best with what I've got, anyone know were I could find a torrent for the  Content packs? I need concrete walls and guns."
,coheedisdead,2008-03-15T02:36Z,i dont know what im doing. can someone say how to get it to work. short and sweet.
,jdock1,2008-04-15T08:20Z,"Wow thanks so much dude.

Everyone. If you are confused, this is what you do.

The demo itself is the full version, however it lacks tutorials on how to use it.

When you download this, there will be a pdf tutorial. Just read that and you will understand."
,Scope51791,2008-08-05T05:30Z,"I've been looking for a torrent that has the full Torque Game Engine but most have only shown demos.  I am sorry but I can't seem to figure it out.  It seems that when I read the comments, there is a way to make it the full engine.  But when I open up the icon on my desktop, it only shows demo stuff.  When I open the demo, it asks me to buy the game engine.  What am i doing wrong."
,J_Walk,2009-01-06T03:19Z,"torque is old and outdated. go to this link.

http://www.tradebit.com/filedetail.php/5027852-insomnia

 you can get both powerrender and leadwersk for 50 dollars. leadwerks is a nextgen game engine that runs 150 dollars and powerrender is also a nextgen engine running directx 9. both more advanced and easier to use then torque.

this is 250 dollars worth of software you cant find on the internet for free. you get the license access to the download area and everything for 50 dollars."
,RedAlert7,2009-03-08T09:01Z,"I use Norton 360, and once i download and install the this, im going to do a comprehensive (highest-possible depth) scan of my computer. If i detect a virus i will say so. DOnt worry i will scan my cmoputer first to make sure that i did not have any virusus before the download. =)"
,skojones,2009-03-27T16:52Z,"This is in response to user: Scope51791
In order to get the full version, just right click on the ""Torque Game Engine Demo"" icon, located in your start menu, then click properties.
Now, on the target field, at the end of the line, you'll see '-game demo', just change it to: '-game'
That's it. Enjoy! 
However, I purchased the new Torque 3D, which is the best thing I've ever used. A link to it is below.
