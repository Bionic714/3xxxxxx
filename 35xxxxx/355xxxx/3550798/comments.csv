,aupower,2006-11-25T19:10Z,"i just finished the game myself.
can't belive how great it is. im soaking wet on my back, and i was realy nervouse in the end. took me wuite a while to figure out how to finnish the last boss, but i did and it feels GREAT!!
notice that its upload in a realoded version, and i can't help but wonder why noone has downloaded this version. it's been out much longer and has NO problems to it what so ever!
there is no virus, spyware,malware or anything attatched.
i can only say: Criminal Origin the game....
Best ever...
now i can go back to Fm2007...."

but as i said, the game is awsome... right now i bought fifa07 on ps2 and i play that, but EA still hasn't managed to remove bugs. the game frezes ocationly. three times when i browse the transfermenu now... think i'll buy PES6 and play that instead!

happy newyear everyone!"
