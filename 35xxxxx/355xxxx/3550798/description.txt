This is a GREAT game!
You play a detective and suddenly find youreself cought in a reality thats not what you thought.
after exmining a crimescene the killer catches you off guard and steals youre gun.
You have to follow him, and while you do so, collecte evidence that lies around in the chapters. to do so you have a lot of forensic tool to help you.
Oh, and the greatest thing is that you got a tazer and can also pick up thing all around you to use as weaponds.
fancy smacking a criminal with a steelpipe? no? with a sign? no, then man you can use the fireaxe,crowboard or whatever you find lying around!!! or just blow off his head with a shotgun.....

I have to state that the meaning of this contend is not to offend anyone. I belive in freedom and choose of religion by will.

Also i would like to state that violente videogames are good if you can separate reality and viritual reality.

Dont try this at home folks!

Enjoy
