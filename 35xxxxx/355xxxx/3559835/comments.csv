,Kwibbe,2006-11-18T14:27Z,I fixed it! - wrong directory.
,eminenz,2006-11-18T18:55Z,"brilliant, kwibbe, an amazing treat, thanks so much!"
,Kwibbe,2006-11-19T19:37Z,"More info:

= Two dvd's
First 1:1 excellent quality
Second dvd 9 to 4, good but not excellent
Audio 100%

Includes cover, hunderds of pages of sheetmusic,  booklet.

Recorded in Amersfoort, The Netherlands, 2005

Amsterdam, Baroque Orchestra and Choir

Boys Choir of Sacrements Breda

In my opinion: much better then Koopmans recording on cd for Erato

Success,

,Meowulf,2008-05-23T01:13Z,"Would you guys please reseed it?

Thanks in advance!"
,Meowulf,2008-06-01T01:32Z,"Thanks for the occasional presence of seeds, it's appreciated. 

Weird thing, I've gotten slightly over 3GB, it tells me I have 1.76 GB to go, AND that I'm at 50.9%. My maths fails me here :)  (hash failures were only ca. 9MB, so they are not the culprit)"
,Permanentus,2008-06-06T13:34Z,"@Meowulf: don't too much pay attention to the info on the size  of the downloaded file.

@Kwibbe: I think I managed to revive your torrents, by reposting them here and there. I can see 12 to 14 leechers right now, compare this to some 16 downloads completed in 1.5 years. :) Well, they are worth it. Thanks for sharing, man."
