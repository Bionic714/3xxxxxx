,hedkandi,2006-12-02T22:23Z,"Sorry for the very very slow and desesperating upload. 
I dont have too much upload velocity at my internet connection. Also have others uploadings too. 
Hope that enjoy it after finished."
,Butane Bob,2006-12-03T17:30Z,"I've confirmed it works properly in Windows, with Zoom Player.

Also: sorry, hedkandi, for my earlier comment. The torrent is very much appreciated. :)"
,kismet_deity,2006-12-05T04:36Z,"I concur with enzeth in that this dvd doesn't play correctly.  That's wonderful that it plays in zoom player, though I tried with that as well and had no success.  Would the seeder please find a correction to the file or explain what we aren't seeing.  Thank you."
,jscottyh,2006-12-09T04:03Z,"I haven't downloaded the file yet, but the audio format (as described in hedkandi's description) is in DTS format and you may need a decoder for DTS Audio. That's my 2 cents."
,hedkandi,2006-12-11T10:02Z,"About the freeze image when play the album. Don't select FIRST PLAY. Select at side right of menu the option PLAY ALL. Other option, don't know. I tested at this moment with Windows Media Player and it works.
About the people that can't hear sorry for that but i told on the description that only includes DTS. Surely there is the problem."
,zaii,2007-07-25T05:42Z,"This torrent works with media player
i burned it onto a cd with nero 7
trying to figure out how to fix the audio because the video wrks on a standard dvd player but the sound wont....
I know about dts ...but when burned the dvd offers the option of regular stereo 5.1
lemme know if any one burns it successfully...and how they did it"
,LdMarduk,2008-12-12T00:26Z,This was a complete and absolute waste of bandwidth. It took 4 days to download...and then was completely useless where viewing it. There was noe audio and it could nae be moved from my HD (and it sounded so interestin)
,gino_m,2010-04-14T15:46Z,"Seed please!
