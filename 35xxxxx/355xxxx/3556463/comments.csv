EFF discusses Landmark Education's misuse of the DMCA subpoena"
,kenmarton,2006-12-08T23:39Z,"This ""documentary"" is a disgrace. It vilifies a fine educational organization, Landmark Education, whose effectiveness and utility in people's lives have been confirmed by studies done at both Harvard and USC. This video employs a variety of emotive-manipulative techniques to influence the viewer's thoughts and feelings (ominous music, targets painted on people's faces, etc.), which act to inhibit rather than support critical thought. It is ironic that the video attacks Landmark for ""brainwashing"", when in fact the video employs the kinds of techniques that are more akin to brainwashing. I have a Ph.D. in the neurosciences from a major university, have enjoyed a great deal of benefit from Landmark programs, and find this video appalling. The most appaling aspect of it is that its producers seem so willing to damage an organization that has brought so much benefit to so many people."
,37sammills,2006-12-09T09:14Z,"The producers of the Pieces a Conviction or ""Exhibits"" program are very highly regarded. 

They were featured speakers at the ""Conference on Investigative Journalism"" in October 2006. At the conference they actually specifically addressed using hidden cameras as a useful tactic in investigative journalism. 

They have received paraice from Time Magazine, the International Herald Tribune, and 60 Minutes. 

In 2003, they received a prize for the investigation into the Frigates of Taiwan. In 2005, they received the FIGRA award for their investigation into convicted killer Patrice Alegre. In 2006, they received both the Albert-Londres prize and the Dauphine-Henri TĂŠzenas of Montcel prize. 

The ""ominous music, targets painted on people's face"" as you put it, are common sound and graphic design editing styles used by the program in many of their other episodes as well. 

One only has to search Google ""Landmark Education cult"" to see a very different history than the one portrayed by the company itself..."

Ken your writing reads like something I'd expect from a ""true believer"" which discredits you, since you are a follower of LEC's Forum, and therefore EST and Werner Erhard a.k.a. John Paul ""Jack"" Rosenberg.

The point of brainwashing should never be used in cases like this, because brainwashing always implies physical torture, so of course it's not brainwashing.

But Elements of abusive mind control techniques are used, loaded language is employed, manipulation of time, environment, and information are essential to the Forum. Aggressive recruiting techniques are used, new students are pressed to recruit others while the glow on their faces is still bright.

The pressure from their peers to perform is overwhelming, the desire to give others this nondescript feeling from ""Getting It."" clouds their judgment. Thinking what the world does is a ""Racket"" but the are the real thing, is just bait and switch loaded language.

I don't care if you have a Phd, being a true believer is in conflict with the reality of the situation. You are involved with a High Demand Abusive Group that uses Mind Control techniques to exert Undue Influence on it's followers, by requiring their time and money in exchange for loaded language and implanted phobias."

,chamouf,2011-01-24T11:06Z,"I am in the SELP course right now. During the Advanced Course I changed my life. My ""act"" was this: IT'S EITHER YOU OR ME!!!! I had a competition going on with everyone in the world. ALL 7 BILLION!!! and I was stressed. I couldn't be in relationships, friendships, or ever let anyone get close to me. I am so thankful that I got my act...I was ready to leave my ""friend"" in Costa Rica over $17 because I had this ""me against you"" attitude. Bash it all you want. I now have a great relationship with my friends and mom because of landmark. Maybe they do brainwash...but maybe we need some brainwashing from all the crap we've made up in our lives and lived around :)"
