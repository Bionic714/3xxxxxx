The film's soundtrack was actually recorded in four-track stereo, although it had not been filmed in Cinemascope, but the film was eventually released in mono.  The film was eventually released that way on laserdisc.

so which version is this....?"

Ok.... ""Audio Channel Count: 1"" means Mono... Thanks for the information. "
,kennyg101,2006-11-12T10:59Z,You're welcome. It would be nice to see a full surround rip of this great movie.

I' had  seen this movie, in a bad copy. in the mid sixties. By then, my English was pretty much rudimentary. 
I bought the book with the Play in the early days of February 1964 (yes, sixty four).
Whether or not Shakespeare copied Plutarch line by line is Immaterial. Nobody reads Plutarch, millions today stiill read Shakespeare..

Did you ever notice that his work transformed the then English Germanic dialect into a language of culture by incorporatining Latin expressions, sometimes grammar, into it... 

Well let us give a small place  from praise, to a few complaints:

1-Well kennyg101, you are indeed an honourable man, when you publish the Techinlcal specs. The Image resolution does not do justice to this masterpiece, but you afvised us...
On the other hand the sound is pretty good, IF YOU HAVE a center Channel amplfiication. Normally I do not, but I can set-up my equipment to do it without messing up with cables.

There is  absolutely no need to ""upgrade"" or ""traficate"" the sound to DD 5.1 or whatever. It is good Mono, leave it that way and amplify it properly. It is almost Crystal Clear. 

I would appreciate if you could point me to a site that has English subtitles for this movie. Went to over 10 sites, Googled it, no way. 
Does everybody in England and America know Shakespeare by heart. I doubt..

Thanks again to the good work..."
