From the director of All About Eve, this William Shakespeare play features Louis Calhern in the title role, Marlon Brando (earning his third consecutive Best Actor Oscar nomination) as Marc Antony, James Mason as Brutus, and (now Sir) John Gielgud as Cassius. The film won an Academy Award for its Cedric Gibbons led B&W Art Direction-Set Decoration; it also received Oscar nominations for Best Picture, Joseph Ruttenberg\'s B&W Cinematography and Miklós Rózsa\'s Score. Also appearing are: Edmond O?Brien, Greer Garson as Calpurnia, Deborah Kerr, George Macready, Alan Napier, Ian Wolfe, Douglass Dumbrille, Rhys Williams, and Paul Guilfoyle, among others. The classic story features Brutus and Cassius plotting against and eventually murdering Caesar, fearing his power relative to their own. Antony, with support of the people, pursues them. This leads to a splitting of allegiances but, ultimately, Antony is victorious.
