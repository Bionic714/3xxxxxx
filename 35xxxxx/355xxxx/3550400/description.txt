DVD Genie allows you to modify the region code for popular software-based
DVD Players such as Software Cinemaster, PowerDVD and WinDVD (among a few).
It also allows you to tweak these programs with undocumented features to
better fit your system.

DVD Genie will also allow you to select which program runs when a DVD Disc
is inserted into the drive and contains support for fullscreen Zooming on
widescreen movies with certain players.
