,jorno.net,2006-11-06T23:09Z,"I started seeding with 10 MBit for the first hour-and-a-half, but I saw thing moved too slowly, so I have now raised the upload to 50 MBit. Hope you'll enjoy the speed. ;)"
,jorno.net,2006-11-07T11:14Z,"I have now seeded this 5000%, which should be more than enough to let everyone enjoy this torrent. Therefor I am now turning the upload down to 10MBit again. Sorry for this, but I need my connections to other torrents also. ;)"

,jorno.net,2006-11-12T15:33Z,"Jepp, denne DVDr'en fungerer fint med norsk tekst. :-)"
[V],Jag92,2006-11-13T20:19Z,noen som vet hvordan jeg kan få vekk kopibeskyttelsen på filmer? CSS eller hva det heter...anybody knows how I can take the copy protection away from movies??
,jorno.net,2006-11-13T21:01Z,"Jag92: Use DVDShrink. :-) It does not only compress movies, and allow you to remove certain subs/audio-tracks, but also removes the copy protection.
If not, DVD Decrypter and DVDFab Decrypter are great programs for ripping DVD's. DVDFab also takes some protections which neither DVDshrink or DVD Decrypter could take."

,jorno.net,2006-11-19T20:26Z,"Simen0401: There are 83 seeders! If the download does not go fast enough for you, it's because 50% of the users on TPB are leechers who does not seed the apropriate amount back. I have seeded shitloads on this torrent (more than 400 GB), so now it's up to the rest of the users... (that means you!)..."
