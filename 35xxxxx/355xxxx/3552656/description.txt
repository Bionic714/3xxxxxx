I could not find this already beeing uploaded at The Pirate Bay, so I decided to rip and seed this for myself.

I used DVDFab Decrypter to rip the DVD, and then ran it trough DVDShrink to make it smaller.

Removed:
- Audio: Hungarian, English Directors Comment
- Subs: Hungarian, Dutch, Hebrew, and all Directors Comment subs..
Besides that, everything is included on this DVD. Full menues, both 2-ch and 5.1-ch audio, 




Those of you who want to whine about the quality: Go F(!) yourself. I find this quality very good, and if you want something better; Go buy the frigging DVD instead!
