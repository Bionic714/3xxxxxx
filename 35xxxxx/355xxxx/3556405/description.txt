Spoken language: catalan (not spanish) 

Summary of the match played today between Barcelona and Zaragoza. Ronaldinho was simply fantastic!! He saved again Barcelona of a sure draw...he scored two goals...

The résumé of the match was recorded from Channel 33 using a TDT AverTv card and then compressing the file to wmv, a television from Barcelona, Catalunya. that\'s why the spoken language is catalan. enjoy ronnie!
