,Djacko,2006-11-08T06:46Z,Vilket program ska man ha för att se på denna fil? Det går inte med mediaplayern eller DivX. 
,mctart,2006-11-09T02:17Z,"Yawn. Really don't bother. If you want to watch 45 minutes of someone driving around some streets, waste your bandwidth or jump in the car with me as I drive to work, both are equally as exciting!

There are 
0 real chases
0 close calls
hundreds of red lights driven through
The exciting parts was when the film was fast-forwarded and somehow he misses a gear when he is driving slowly.

The driver has a really top notch BMW - carbon everything and the engine at the start does sound mean. He does get followed by 3 police vans, which must have a top speed of 60 and he passes some police volvos and drives so fast away they can't even begin to chase. 

If your interested in some good chases find Ghostrider, at least he lets the police catch up. If you like car chases find ghostrider 4. Theres a good one in there. I think GR3 has a Subaru chase


Sorry for the poor review, but this is rubbish"
,Beavernisse,2007-01-28T00:37Z,"mctart don´t complain, it´s not the same thing riding around on a motorbike and driving a real car during a getaway. The main reason why they can come so close to the squad cars is because the swedish police ain´t allowed to push a motorbike offtrack while they are allowed to do that with a car! So if you really want something better then go out there and do it, if you have the balls to do it! ;)"
