,XiaoJjang,2007-09-27T22:08Z,Umm...how do i run this game? Its just some .mdf files.
,picnicbasket,2007-09-28T18:34Z,.mdf is a CD image file. You should be able to run it by mounting it with Daemon or MagicISO or whatever virtual drive software you have.
,SombreDoom,2007-10-10T02:36Z,"I've downloaded PCB, extracted it and mounted the image. Now the problem is I don't understand how to install it or run it. Could someone help me?"
,SombreDoom,2007-10-11T00:19Z,"Can anyone help me, I'll send for 2 weeks and if no one helps, I'll take my bandwidth elsewhere."
