,orchird,2008-11-24T17:27Z,"the rip of the original santa clause is terrible. I've seen tons of 700MB movies before, but this one is not up to the quality of the others. If you are looking for quality this torrent isn't for you. The movie is improperly cropped also, so it doesn't fit your screen right. If you don't care about any of the above, then go for it, but if you do, you've been warned. "
