A rogue gunman is on the loose in Tokyo who, although actually fires upon his victims, has never once managed to hit and kill anyone. The police launch a major investigation to track down the perpetrator, but the teenage daughter of the police chief leading the case befriends the gunman and finds he is not the person the police and media believe him to be.


I haven't seen this film myself so I really can't anything about it. The average rating from imdb is pretty good.
Hopefully it's a decent flick. No thoughts this time, hehe.
