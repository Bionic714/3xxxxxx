,Jarven,2007-01-08T05:58Z,"Ha ha ha, jag var bara tvungen att skratta. Först sitter folk och klagar på att det är så dåliga låtar, sen klagar dom på att dom måste ladda ner så mycket för att få så lite. Dessutom klagar dom på att det är så mycket låtar och att dom inte är sorterade. 

Gör så här:

1. Ta listan i ""informationen"" till den här Torrenten och kopiera den till ett textdokument. 
2. Radera dom låtar som du inte är intresserade av från den listan.
3. Börja från toppen på listan och sök via Internet efter någonstans att ladda ner den ifrån.
4. Upprepa med nummer 2 på listan osv. tills du är helt klar med listan.
5. Fundera om det kanske inte hade varit enklare att ladda ner 7.65 Gb istället för att försöka hitta alla låtarna själv. 
6. Tänk efter före du skriver en kommentar om hur dåligt något är, kanske någon har lagt ned mycket tid/pengar eller ""själ"" i att fixa DIG något gratis.

Nu när jag ändå är i ZEN-Mode så måste jag ge er en till funderare. Varför säger alla att ""nästan 8 gig, inte orkar jag ladda ner det.""?

Hur svårt är det att ladda ner 8 Gb? Är det jobbigare än 6 Gb? Jag har ännu inte märkt att 8 Gb nedladdningar fått mig att svettas överhuvudtaget. Jag har laddat ned 27 Gb utan att ens få träningsverk dagen efter. 

Tänk på det. "

,VeritasInfinite,2008-02-28T08:09Z,"First off, to say that Hip-Hop sucks and then say that there's ""no trance"" music so this torrent sucks is sort of hipocritical. There wouldn't be trance music if it wasn't for Hip-Hop. DJ Kool Herc started it all, because he noticed that people tended to like only a certain part of a song. Thus, the beat-loop was born. All trance is, is 4 (tops) measures of music looped. Then every once in awhile, some extra noises are tossed on top at the same tempo. That's it. Here, here's a trance song for you: kick-snare-kick-snare-kick-snare.

I am now a DJ.

Trance or house or techno wouldn't exist without Hip-Hop. Learn your music history."

I'll DL it just because I'll keep all the songs, one never knows when something is needed, and it saves effort just to have it.

I'd like to see this keep going for my own personal amusement though..."
,gobbe100,2008-04-10T14:31Z,"GAHHHH   i want just one song
 of this"
,kelv1969,2008-04-12T13:56Z,god man. upload your files as separates next time. what a useless torrent. who is going to want to download the whole of this? 
,t8765,2008-04-16T06:59Z,"we have similar musical tastes and I would not mind downloading this entire list at all, boo to those who have probably never taken the time to uplaod and give a little something back.  Jolly good effort dpr i applaud your contrabution"
,alepro,2008-04-19T03:47Z,nice collection of THE SHITTIEST MUSIC EVER
,Nazgul9666,2008-04-19T03:49Z,"ok...i  found this entry doing a search for ""The Gregg Allman Band"".... what's listed at #575 as Gregg Allman - Midnight Rider  is wrong...that song is an Allman Brothers tune.... and ""yes"" there is a difference....this is the second time of only @ 6 search results total...can get a bit frustrating.....sort of like finding  David Lee Roth -Running With the Devil or Robert Plant - Stairway to Heaven lol  ...kudos on the work and collection though..."
,miniyou,2008-04-20T11:45Z,A lot of good music but even more gangsta/shit ;)
,jameswsparker,2008-04-21T13:21Z,"To the fucking twat that said 'nice collection to the shittiest music ever'. Your an idiot.
I'm sure you've heard it several times, don't fucking consider downloading it if you don't want it.
You know, watching everyone bitch, whine and cry like little bitches on here really is quite funny. I'm going to have a yogurt now, tara. PS Have a biscuit or something, get off your fucking computers for once. You fat fucks!"
,PentaMedia,2008-04-26T13:07Z,"Why didnt you just put each artist/group in its own seperate archive...?
Winrar have that extremely GOOD feature to put each folder in its own archive... Use that next time!!!"
,jonas-pirat,2008-04-28T17:45Z,where is B.Y.O.B with soad?  and there aint anything with BFMV and Coal Chamber? and slipknot before i forget?  nirvana - smells like teen spirit? and more with papa roach?  else you have some good ones exept that gangsta/shit
,Gordan_Freeman,2008-05-07T05:15Z,"justindudeok: i second your comment, but i'm with the other people (not complaining) and i already have my own playlist."

hahaha, what song do you want? did you download the whole thing? I´m not going to download this, but still, kudos to you, dread pirate roberts, who went through with writing all the names on every song... hahaha!!"

,stotah,2008-05-14T12:08Z,"I'm downloading all of this cos my computer's fucked and I want to fill up a new mp3 player with loads of music. I only like about half of this (ie the better half of the hip hop, sublime, etc), Nickelback is for pathetic Canadian emos."
,Agirl25,2008-05-15T05:51Z,"Wow,I read all of those comments and most of the people typing crap can't even spell.  I'm a noob to all this,but it seems to me that you people are crying a river about something that is free!  Haven't you ever heard you get what you pay for?  Kudos to you dread for giving back to the community,and don't listen to those cry babies.                                                     Those who mind don't matter,and those who matter don't mind!"
,mtlicat,2008-06-05T06:31Z,"I just couldn?t keep myself from sending my own thoughts. 
First, my hat comes off for you DPR.
I personally don't care for much of you?re the songs in your list. 
So I probably won?t be DLing this. But really, ""thanks"" for the contribution. Your hard work and time went into creating this and making it available for the real fans.  
Don't listen to these whiners. Some people aren't happy with anything, even if it is free. "
,PsychopathicMetal08,2008-06-14T22:36Z,"I dont see the uploader bashing all YOUR tastes in music, therefor why are you bashing his? YOU cant tell him what he can and cant listen to or what he should and shouldnt like -- basically if you dont like it dont download it DUMBASS 

but I must say you made the rookies mistake of uploading a RAR but im not gonna complain -- its your first torrent, your still learning and everyone fucks up just remember to not upload a RAR next time and you'll be fine =]

personally I like your taste in music, and I respect the fact you took the time and made the effort to list the entire contents of your torrent, unlike most the lazy bastards on this site who dont name half the shit in their torrents -- so well done newbie =]"
,armageddalhobbit,2008-06-26T07:49Z,"Alright, for all you dumbasses that complain...

SHUT THE FUCK UP! You don't want it, fine. but just from the count of seeders/leechers(at the time of my dl)... at least 55 of us do want it. the rest of you need to grow up. 

dpr, thanx for the torrent. even if it is a rar archive, it's much appreciated.
"
,exxonvaldeez,2008-07-02T01:04Z,"If someone who downloads this would please take the tracks from Bubba Sparxxx Deliverance album and make a torrent from that, I would be much appreciative. I don't feel like downloading 7 gig of stuff I already have or don't want. If you make that torrent it will be THE ONLY ONE on the internet, I searched many sites for, just not there....thanks"
,Mr.Mash,2008-07-19T22:01Z,Any1 got Roy jones Jr. - Body head bangerz album? you should make a torrent at it.
,xxashleyxx1389,2008-07-25T13:09Z,"In reply to exxonvaldeez.

All you have to do is unselect the songs you don't want in the ""Add New Torrent"" box before you start the download.

If that box doesn't show up for you... i don't know what to tell you."
,yinsw,2008-07-29T17:20Z,It's one big .RAR file.. you can't do selective download
,GothicProphet,2008-07-29T17:23Z,Why do people feel the need to RAR their torrents?  It just makes it annoying for people who don't want everything in it.
,mario-mushroom,2008-08-01T21:22Z,Damn thats nice but the worst/funniest thing is i only have 8 gigs left after spending 3 of them on rolling stones top 500 songs
,skanman14,2008-08-18T04:15Z,"man...as much as i would love to talk shit about this torrent (i make a point of insulting peoples taste in music), i cant. I mean you have some REALLY wack selections in here, but the fact that you have such a diverse mix here makes me impressed, and the stuff that i hate is probably someones favorite and the stuff that i love someone else hates, youve probably got legions of people listening to music theyve never been exposed to simply because its attached via torrent that contains music theyre familiar with. props homie"
,jeepmansro,2008-08-22T14:13Z,"This is a great diverse mix of music and I like it, it looks very similar to my collection! Thanks for the D/L!!!"
,Nasuttaja,2008-08-26T16:37Z,.rar files are BULLSHIT. Who still really thinks that is good????

,ThaSwede,2008-10-30T12:56Z,"I wanted 1 of these songs -.-
Let's here it for .rar files everyone :D Hoooraaay"
,Omakayd,2008-11-29T22:23Z,"there is nothing rare in here so why are you people complaining about wanting certain songs?

It's just a bunch of mainstream rap, rock and top100 type pop songs anyways.  go look somewhere else if you don't want this torrent.  simple as that.  the uploader was kind enough to give you a list of the tracks."
,Pirate4fun,2009-01-17T04:01Z,"Nice collection do u happen to have the whole lil flip cd undaground legend i have been looking everywhere for it and this is the closest i get if u do please put up a torrent of it, thanks alot"

This is the whole point of filesharing."
,nymersic,2009-08-23T01:48Z,"I don't wanna talk shit about peoples' torrents, I appreciate them, and I'm sure we all do.  Maybe certain dread pirates could take some constructive criticism, though.  Like making sure that a torrent is as top-notch as feasible before releasing it.  Example:
          188. Bob Marley - Bufalo Soldier.mp3
          189. Bob Marley - buffalo soldier.mp3
Really?  Thanks anyway, but I just can't bring myself to download this.  Clean it up and it would be a lot more appealing."

,fish_fingers,2009-10-24T02:34Z,Well don't zip the damn thing. Jeez.
,Enojado,2009-11-17T09:49Z,"You people complain too fucking much. Find another torrent, don't come on here bashing him for what he listens to, or has uploaded, or HOW he's uploaded. Beggars can't be fucking choosers. And I bet more than half you are only here TO beg, i.e. download, seed for an hour or two then be on your way. 

And to Shrapcheder, its not 'nigger' music, its rap. Atleast have decency to call it by its name, and not some derogative shit like that. I can atleast bet most of those 'niggers' can spell better than you, and spell Sharpchedder right."
