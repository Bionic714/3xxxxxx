A very good wargame =)

Check info at http://www.battlegoat.com/supreme.php


I've provided a temporary key for installing the game (beware you have to put a space  before entering the code) , i also provided all the patches.
However with the key i have (the only one to be found around) the game will work till patch 012, with latest patches you should see 'white boxes' instead of graphics.
Either some of you can share another key or you may look at the various exe i've put in all patch folders and find out how to fix this check

So patch 012 works
Patch 431 doesn't work
