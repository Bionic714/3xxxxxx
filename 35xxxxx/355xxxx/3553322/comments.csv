,duder1,2006-11-07T22:04Z,"upload to me faster. I'm able to upload at around 130Kbps.  I believe I was ur first connection but then it slowed down as others connected to you. 

Thx for the upload"
,duder1,2006-11-07T22:05Z,lol
,neslesman,2006-11-07T22:12Z,"Cool, that 's the AOPA members freebie with the glass cockpit.  This from Avsim below.  Aren't we all charter members of the AOPA?

AOPA = Association of the Pirates of America

Free to AOPA members, the virtual Cherokee Six duplicates nearly every detail of the sweepstakes airplane, including the S-Tec System Fifty-Five X autopilot ? which includes S-Tec's flight director and altitude preselector ? the Sandel SN-3500 electronic horizontal situation indicator, Garmin GNS 530/GNS 430 navigators, Avidyne FlightMax EX500 multifunction display, and JP Instruments EDM-930 engine gauge cluster.

The program, developed by Flight1 Software in conjunction with AOPA, requires a personal 
computer running Windows XP and Microsoft Flight Simulator 2004. "

,neslesman,2006-11-07T23:15Z,"I've looked at it on the ground now, it's a great cockpit and very user friendly and intuitive with excellent documentation.  A bit tough on FPS but to be expected with all the goodies.  

Very nice overall and I love the Cherokee 6.

Another 100 pages to read now, sure glad I saved that old computer."
,4X-AXG,2006-11-08T00:07Z,"awesome, love those Flight1/AOPA planes"
,GeeTI,2006-11-08T00:41Z,"Just tested in FSX and I  can confirm its 95/99% compatible.....only problem that I saw was that one of the ""glass"" instrument gauges failed to show up in vc mode.The other Garmin/Sandel gauges appear to work fine !!!"
,neslesman,2006-11-08T01:13Z,"There's supposed to be an FSX fix out any moment now and it should make it on here.  I'm liking this aircraft more and more by the moment.  It's like a 57 Chevy with space shuttle systems, very cool."

,colimodio,2006-11-09T13:39Z,"great plane! thanks AOPA.
Question:
--Has anyone noticed that some planes from flight1 ""get checked"" through the Internet by them? and if your license is not ""real"" ( made with the unwrappers we love so much ) they get deleted automatically? --Comments would be appreciated.--"
