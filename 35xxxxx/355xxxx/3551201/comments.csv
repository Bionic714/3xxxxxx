,Bzzzt,2006-11-04T15:10Z,Coiuld you please tell us something about the quality? And will you in fact be seeding it to the very end? My peers all seem to be stuck at 0.3% - not exactly very impressive.

Usually I seed until one more seeder appears."
,vidursingal,2007-07-04T22:01Z,"hi

the english srt is included but the subs are not showing when playing the movie ??

anything i can do to change that ?"
,jibbb,2007-08-03T07:51Z,"Depends on the player you use. In VLC you point at the srt file. MPC performs a search. JetAudio must find it independently. In general, if you click right mouse button on the movie being played, most players should list among the options choice of the subtitle track.

Which one is yours? "
