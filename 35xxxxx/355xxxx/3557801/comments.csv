,jonahx,2006-11-15T07:40Z,DD5.1 was ripped? 90% of the DVD players in homes can't play DTS yet!! Not all people are rich nerds buying the latest gizmos coming out..
,anthrax,2006-11-15T08:14Z,How do I create a new torrent and SEED it  http://btfaq.com/serve/cache/56.html
,aztekkrille,2006-11-15T08:23Z,"Rich nerds, latest ...what???
DTS is hardly not new , I think that every reciever ( amp ) from 4-5 years back handles DTS!!!!!

GET A GRIP!"
,ryknow,2006-11-15T10:28Z,I agree with aztekkrille. Not sure where jonahx got the idea that 90% of DVD-players can't handle DTS. I think most of them can. At least mine does and it cost less than 60 euros :)
,DCIONE,2006-11-15T21:16Z,"DTS is goooooood :) NEarly every Player plays it and nearly every Surround Amplifier can handle it i think.
So lean back and enjoy!"
