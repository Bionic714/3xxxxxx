Populous 3: The Beginning, Undiscovered Worlds, Populous Reincarnated's New Worlds and Multiplayer MatchMaker.

Here's how to install everything in the correct order:

1. burn "Populous The Beginning.iso" with any iso burning software or mount with alcohol and install the game with "COMPLETE install" checked (if you dont do a complete install, you wont be able to play the game without CD plus the Multiplayer MatchMaker will not find needed files, so make sure you do COMPLETE, the game only takes up like 400 Mb, so its no biggy)

2. run "Populous The Beginning_Updatepatch.exe" (this will update the game and also applies a no-cd crack)

3. run "Populous Undiscovered Worlds_Addon.exe"

4. run "Populous Undiscovered Worlds_Updatepatch.exe"

Now you can play Populous The Beginning and Undiscovered Worlds.
