,nanaem,2006-11-16T16:48Z,"dosnt work on XP for me. didnt expect it either though, but had to try. :)"
,weedje,2006-11-16T20:07Z,"It should work on XP after installing the ""Populous The Beginning_Updatepatch.exe""...
Afterall, most people who play it on the matchmaker are using XP too, me also...
In most cases, its a videocard problem if it doesnt work on XP, try using the ""Software modus"", as that doesnt use any graphics acceleration, it should work fine..

If all else fails, visit the matchmaker lobby and ask some people how to make it work, surely theres someone who can help u."

A .iso burning program isn't the same as a virtual device manager. The first is a program that burns the .iso into a cd/dvd, and the second is a program that tricks the computer to think that you have a cd/dvd with the file in.

DAEMON is the best/easiest virtual device manager, and Alcohol 120% is the best/easiest burning program for the moment.

Sorry if this wasn't understandable. Hope it was."
