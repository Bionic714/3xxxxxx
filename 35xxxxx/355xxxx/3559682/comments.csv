,djsiryn,2006-11-18T10:24Z,"sorry but this is for a few uploads that i have done....I am kinda new to this torrent thing and I have been tryinf to give the best uploads possible for me but i keep getting complaints. If I keep getting complaints i am going to stop uploading all together. Let alone the non seeding people. Remember these are free and mostly free or pirated copies. I am trying my best and want to share my collection with you all but I will not share if no one else seeds......please seed till your ratio is at least 1.50 or more...actually more around 1.80 and the seed will last for a long time. Thank you
