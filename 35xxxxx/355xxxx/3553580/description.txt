A little something I'm giving back to the BSD community ...

PC-BSD 1.3 Beta - VMware - Vanilla Edition

"PC-BSD has been designed with the "casual" computer user in mind. Home users will immediately feel comfortable with PC-BSD's desktop interface, with KDE 3.5 running under the hood.

Software installation has also been designed to be as painless as possible, simply double-click and software will be installed."
