,Clapton,2006-11-15T23:52Z,"Luis Miguel is the King. ""Noche de Paz"" is so awesome...with gospel choirs, soulful rythm... one of the best christmas albums I ever heard... Highly recommended although you don't understand spanish...when you hear Luis Miguel voice...all you can say is...WOW! He is one of the best white pop singers in the whole world... "
