Season three deals with the war drawing to a close, and the survivors' return to Singapore. Their struggles to return to "normal" and realisation that they may have had more freedom in prison, away from the strictures of post-war austerity, are perfectly played.

Part two follows them as it leads up to their finally parting and going their own ways.  Before they leave they vow to hold a reunion on the 5th anniversary.
