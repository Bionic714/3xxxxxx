,leonid,2006-11-09T04:47Z,This is the real one. The other one is crap! Some n00b
,timmyp3,2006-11-09T04:49Z,"Thanks...

...and, um, is it just me or is there no seed?"
,gibsta8570,2006-11-09T04:50Z,Thanks man  :)
,gibsta8570,2006-11-09T04:57Z,"original release is normally in one .avi file, not .rar, this one is a lot more plausible than the 600mb torrent though, i'm downloading."
,EasternBloc,2006-11-09T05:02Z,Nice One!
,gibsta8570,2006-11-09T05:03Z,Swarm speed is over 16 MB/s  :)
,Cheetahh,2006-11-09T05:06Z,Thx
,timmyp3,2006-11-09T05:08Z,"I take back my earlier statement.  There are now at least 5 seeds.

Oh, and what is this about the ""original release"" being on large .avi file?  It comes off of the FTP site as multiple .rar files.  Just because you're not used to seeing them this way,does not mean that this is not the way the file is sourced.  Seems to me that you've just been spoiled by someone farther up the food chain going through the motions of un-rar'ing it for you. "
,gibsta8570,2006-11-09T05:14Z,"ok, thanks for info. I ain't gonna get get cocky, i've never made a torrent so you probably know more than me. The avi ones are up now too, so that would seem to prove your point that they are made from the .rar ones."
,EasternBloc,2006-11-09T05:15Z,"MrDaniel...

Now who's the mug? The other release has been deleted.

NooBy... keep yer butt cheeks shut next time... especially when you don't know what ya talkin about!"
,DukeT,2006-11-09T05:19Z,Great job guys! Tnx!
,timmyp3,2006-11-09T05:22Z,"I just re-read my comments and realized I came off as a cocky ass.  

My apologies to anyone offended."
,gibsta8570,2006-11-09T05:26Z,"no probs mate, I didn't actually mean 'original' anyway, i meant more 'real' rather than 'fake' in relation to the nearly 700MB torrent that first appeared. Anyway, I'm in IT and take the approach that nobody knows everything, if someone corrects me then I am thankful, it means I learn something."
,celox,2006-11-09T05:36Z,"That's frkn fast! Thanks alot for this fast release, I'm able to watch it before I go to bed this way :) Keep on releasing Lost this fast it ROCKS!"

,hab32,2006-11-09T19:19Z,"there are supposed to be 1386 seeders, now i'm not some kick ass computer genius but as far as i know this means i shouldn't be downloading with an average of about 20KB/s.. anyone experiencing the same problem? maybe some guys could raise their upload rate? thx"
