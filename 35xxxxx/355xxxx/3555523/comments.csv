Weeks later you had to buy the CD again because of the added songs. Now he is doing the same thing again with his walmart DVD box. All concerts on the DVDs are edited and songs omitted. I bet he sells the concert DVDs again in January as complete DVDs. When he re-released his old stuff he had one lousy bonus song added to every CD. So every fan had to buy this stuff again just to get the one song. He betrays his fans. So, please download his music and don't support this scoundrel."
