Extended Spirit are not corrupted middle-aged men who disguise themselves in paisley-print vests and open shirts and inundate God\'s glorious creation with instrumental bilge water. They are members of the German movement that has given us God\'s glorious creation Jazzanova, Beanfield, and even the Compost Label (named after the roster\'s fecundity, no doubt).

Solid Water has a squelchy, squirmy, mulchy, and compostular opening cut, too. \"Fadin\' In\" does more than, well, fade in; it gets you in the mood for a joyful sixty minutes, bouncy with diminished chords and stylish augmented sevenths.
