MILITIA OF MONTANA

STATEMENT OF PURPOSE
Now, more than ever before, the information highway is reaching into millions of homes all

across America. Everywhere a person goes (Anytown, USA) you can find a conversation taking

place about the direction our nation is heading -- keeping it's sovereign status, or becoming a

state under the governance of the United Nations.
We, at the Militia of Montana, are dedicated to ensuring that all Americans are educated to

make an informed decision as to which direction America should go. Along with being physically

prepared to withstand the onslaught which will erupt no matter where we end up, we must at all

costs, keep reaching those who have not had the opportunity to decide for themselves.
The Militia of Montana has been, and continues to be, a national focal point for assistiing

Americans in forming their own grass roots organization dedicated to American's sovereignty and

status as an independent nation among the nations of the world.

This download contains an extensive interview of John Trochmann who together with his brother

David are the founders of the Militia of Montana. This is what seems to be a pretty old rip of

a VHS-tape. I grabbed it from the ed2k network with shareaza.

The audio and video quality is rather poor but its mostly a filmed interview and the

conversation between interviewer and interviewee remains intelligible, even to people who don't

have English as their mother-tongue.

The keywords that came with the file are: NWO, conspiracy, FEMA, 911, banned, secret,

freemason, illuminati. So this implies that this piece of footage is about stuff you won't see

on the 9 o'clock news or Fix news.

For more info about the MOM see for instance:
- see the enclosed .html file, a site I captured since it suspiciously kept 'falling' away. So

I saved it for relaxed reading.

Of course not everybody 'likes' the MOM, such as (surprise surprise) the ADL:
