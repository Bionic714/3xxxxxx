Did you smoke that evil herb \\\"marihuana\\\" while Clinton was President? If so, chances are you listened to Oasis while doing so, but what many people don\\\'t realize is that Oasis was a live band at heart. Their studio albums are shit compared to a live show like CIA\\\'96 or especially Earls Court (the best set of shows Oasis ever did).

Here is a collection of the very best Oasis shows during their glory years (when they did a lot of drugs and knew how to make good music). Some good shows are left out for various reasons: Live By the Sea Southend Cliffs is missing because it\\\'s been released officially, as has There & Then. Utretch and Wolverhampton are missing because, while soundboards, their audio is less than stellar. Earls Court Night One is missing because only one soundboard of it exists to my knowledge, and the quality is very low for a soundboard. Ridiculous, considering Night One was the basis for the There & Then VHS/DVD.

Don\\\'t ask for missing shows, I don\\\'t fill requests. Take it or leave it. Here is what you\\\'ll be taking if you choose to:

1994-06-02 - Gleneagles Golf Club
1994.10.15 - Cabaret Metro, Chicago, IL, USA
1995-01-29 - Commodore Ballroom, Vancouver, Canada
1995-06-23 & 24 - Glastonbury Festival, England
1995-10-14 - Orpheum Theater, Boston, MA, USA
1995.05.11 - Earls Court Night Two
1996-03-17 - International Arena, Cardiff, Wales
1996-04-27 - Maine Road.(Live.In.Manchester)
1996-08-10 & 11 - Knebworth Park, Stevenage, England
1996.03.07 - GMU Patriot Center, Fairfax, VA, USA
1997-08-10 - Hammerstein Ballroom
1997-11-27 - Brabanthallen, Den Bosch, Holland
1997-12-14 - G-Mex Centre, Manchester, England
1998-01-17 - Chicago Rosemont

Every single show is a soundboard recording. Some may have minor omissions (unlikely) or glitches (definitely) because these are bootlegs that have been passed between fans both on and off the internet for a decade. 

Enjoy them. I do. Every single night. Cheers from The Roman Empire... er, America.

Torrent note: I will seed this for a week, and only a week. 

EVERY FILE IN THIS TORRENT IS \\\"SAFE\\\" TO DOWNLOAD (though probably not fully \\\"legal\\\"), AS NO FILE FROM THIS PACK HAS EVER BEEN RELEASED COMMERCIALLY. 

There is a whole site dedicated to Oasis bootlegs here, and they\\\'ve been up for years with not a single complaint from the RIAA:

(bootleg forum is where the downloads are, ignore the site hosted DLs they are terrible)
