,emjaysea,2008-11-16T00:26Z,"I'm only  looking at issue 1 at this point, but this is a crap scan if there ever was one--washed out, and not particularly sharp."
,emjaysea,2008-11-18T00:09Z,"The next 8 scans are good, but PDF???  WTF?"
,redvigilante,2008-12-22T06:40Z,"There is a great PDF to CBR application that you can queue hundreds of items up and go afk for.  I use it for saving Heroes pdfs into CBRs, it's called PDF2CBR.  I don't remember where I got it from anymore, but you should be able to find it in a quick google search (or it might be a torrent here)."

,ramkvp,2011-01-21T20:34Z,"Just finished reading Preacher comics.It turned out to be a very pleasant surprise indeed.
Started off a bit silly but as it progressed,it sort of grows in you.
The main thing that adds credit to the comics is the great story-telling and the even greater character development.A must read for all those guys who will not be offended by the violence and the sheer amount of profanity(principally against god) in it. :)

Rating: 9/10.
Note: Like somebody said in a comment here at tpb, Cassidy alone is worth reading this one. "

,pokerstar24,2011-05-12T04:57Z,lets cam add me bokatwrigkhtelfrieda at h0tmail d0t cum
,Bumfinger,2012-01-04T15:47Z,I'm confused.  The beginning of Dixie Fried isn't there (the whole part where Cassidy meets Eccarius).
,Bumfinger,2012-01-04T15:49Z,"Found it, it's in a separate file."
,w00tbie,2012-01-19T08:07Z,hakonfl thanks for this. got every trade paper in the series except the last one or two. can't wait to see the almighty conclusion to this great story. 
,g0dd0gg,2012-02-17T21:21Z,"Looks awesome, high quality pdf, great work!"
