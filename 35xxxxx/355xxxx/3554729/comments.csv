,Bong_boy,2006-11-17T01:03Z,Dude whats up with the paypal stuff and the other doc? cheers anyway
,Hybrid_Pirate,2006-11-17T01:05Z,"Goddamn it! Why do they alway keep doing this with Lost. I thought every season was done before they started to show the episodes! Or can someone explain why Lost keep having these interuptings.

I think they ruin Lost by doing this."
,drukpa,2006-11-17T17:24Z,"We don't know what exact problems they have with the publishers, all I heard is that they will have a huge issue after third season -  the issue of contracts and sponsorings - so maybe there aint gonna be shooting of the next (4.) season for a long time ( or at all, unfortunately  )- and that's why they're making such a breaks! "
,blue_tomato,2006-11-26T18:18Z,"Who cares? 

Since season 1 Lost has been all about dragging out a thin story forever. The whole season 3 so far could be compressed into one episode, and nothing would be Lost.

Watch Prison Break instead."
,Brunroger,2006-11-26T20:54Z,man..
[V],Ole-The-Dude,2006-11-29T22:09Z,"This really upsets me. I watch Prison Break and Lost, as each episode gets released.

I guess Prison Break it's the only one I'm watching, until Ferbruary..

Damn you, Lost!"
,fulper,2006-12-03T14:12Z,"OZ is way cooler than prisonbreak
