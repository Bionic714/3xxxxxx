,revenger334,2006-12-28T02:31Z,There is no working nintendo ds emulator..there is one with sound and playing many games (not 100%) but go to www.normmatt.com and go to his www.desmume.surge (bla bla bla) on the display thing
,filip_xb95,2007-01-03T21:47Z,dont work on my g6
,Rakinite,2007-01-08T01:04Z,"There are a lot of DS emus that give you PLAYABLE games. None of them are very good though. Apparently No$GBA has DS support, google it and find out perhaps?"
,Alpha_Slayer,2007-01-17T18:30Z,"Right now, very few NDS emulators have very good 3D support. No$GBA does support NDS roms, but you need the NDS BIOS files for that. I'd say the best NDS emulator as of now is DeSmuME v0.5"
,-blakdoctah-,2007-03-08T09:32Z,does anyone know were to get de english 1?

,Mi-Go,2007-03-25T18:42Z,For the moment there is no emu that can play Pokemon Diamond/Pearl properly! Play it on an nds with one of all the aftermarket slots 1 cards that is out ther and btw. hope you speak japanese!
,kaitanuva,2007-04-07T04:01Z,"Actually there IS a working emulator for Pokemon Pearl / Diamond. Yes I'm speaking the truth. Swear to god. No lie. 

Unforunately, it only emulates the games 95%. The gameplay, graphics, and sound are outstanding , HOWEVER...
1. Slow emulation >:O - means 30% to 80%, which is REALLY slow..
2. You can't save!! (includes save states)

Just have to wait until they upgrade the emulator and theh world will rejoice. 

Now I know what you're thinking..No I will not tell you how to set up the emulator and crap. It took me weeks to find the site for it, so you should do it yourself :)"
,forcom,2007-04-16T20:09Z,is this the version from usa or japan?
,inanimateobject,2007-04-18T09:22Z,"Ok, it's simple for all the n00bs who don't understand:

They are working on a DS Emulator that works well.

For more info search for DeSmuMe.
Google, it's not hard.

For those who don't understand ROM jargon (j) means this is in Japanese. The USA version will be released in a few days.

AUS PAL version is TBA on release date.

THIS version SHOULD work on PC just need to use the DeSmuMe emulator. No guarantee though. The best thing we can do for now is thank the uploader and keep the files in storage until we can use them."
