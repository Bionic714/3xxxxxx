,crossmr,2006-11-29T04:48Z,"Garbage. Windows blind crack doesn't work. Claims it succeed then it won't properly apply themes and keeps asking for an activation key
Packing stuff up in custom installers is GARBAGE. "

I had the same problem, make shure you completely quit windows blinds installer (Ctrl + Alt + Del > Processes > WB5... (It begins with WB5, and I think there's INST in the filename to) > End process) then apply the patch, then reboot, then apply skins (if WindowBlinds is installed, uninstall it before you try again)"
