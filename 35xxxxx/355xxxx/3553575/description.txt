The Good: Driving, crashing, and racing simply doesn't get much better than this; meticulously detailed tracks and cars; 28-player online racing is fun and lag-free; massive tuning options; driving school is a great addition. 

The Bad: Hefty system requirements; qualifying seems inordinately hard; menu system needs a makeover.
