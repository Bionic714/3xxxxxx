,mad_flyer,2006-11-18T16:38Z,This 1.03a? IGFLY is offering that shit again for free. Why don't they offer 1.06 or something? Fuck them.
,neo258,2006-11-18T17:12Z,can someone post active camera thx
,4X-AXG,2006-11-19T00:35Z,"haha subtle mad_flyer, very subtle"
,allen_x,2006-11-19T01:54Z,turns out to be quite a shitty little program
,Panodilo,2006-11-19T08:20Z,"I think it's exterior views are superior to anything. It makes Active Camera look like an experiment by a newbie programmer following a tutorial in a Programming for Dummies book. However, the virtual cockpit module blows and chokes on donkey cum. Therefore I run both programs at the same time. You can disable W&F's cockpit module and keep the exterior module and let Active handle the former."
,monstert,2006-11-23T23:08Z,what version is this?
,FL280_DCP,2006-12-07T02:52Z,"Thank you for this shitty program, along with the shitty keygen that doesnt work, and hope that you make more downloads just like this. Exept they dont have to have the 1.03a, they can have 1.06. ""Rolls eyes"""
