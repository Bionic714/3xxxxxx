,President1977,2007-04-26T15:17Z,"1. Use WINRAR and extract files to hcg-ar07 
2. After open this folder and you see ISO file
3. Use Daemon tools and install.
Enjoy!"

,andenxtc,2007-07-14T22:16Z,Funkar hur bra som helst.  Synd att det finns folk som laddar hem program utan att ha elementära kunskaper i uppackning bränning osv. Fast de har väl samma sjukdom som de äldre. rädda för att pröva sig fram

,praethon,2007-08-23T14:59Z,Superb. Fast download and no problems with Nero. Installed first time. Thanks Guys
,philtre,2007-09-16T03:04Z,"Doesn't seem to be compatible with Vista. (Surprised anyone?) I've downloaded the same app from 2 torrents, and after what seems to be a clean install when I run it I'm told that some files have failed to write to registry. There's no mention of Vista support on the website."
,HIyaalll,2008-09-23T21:06Z,"I'm not sure what that .message file contains, I hope it's not the password because I chose to deselect it... But those of you experiencing trouble with this torrent due to that file, are you by any chance on a computer with a Fat harddrive?. I believe that the old style 8 character filename, which still resides within the fat32 even though transparent to the user, might have some issues when it comes to files which it interprets to not have a name, just an extension."
,Mr.McP,2008-09-30T21:11Z,thx dude. Works perfect 
,ketchua,2008-10-10T12:11Z,"is it possible, that autoroute EUROPE doesn't have charted roads in Ukraine, Bosnia, Serbia, Montenegro,Albania, Macedonia, or Greece?"
