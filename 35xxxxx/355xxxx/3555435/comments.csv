This looks like like a german edition, and since the film is french would probably have Deutsch subtitles but I could not find it in Amazon Deutschland.

Meanwhile please keep seeding . There are 4 people at 85% and none is from the Netherlands..."
,rhum_guardian,2006-11-17T09:32Z,"Sorry found it. It speaks German, therefore is dubbed and most probably has no subtitles.
