I would say it is without doubt one of mankinds most important ethic and moral question: Should we allow patents on life? 

At the moment, genetically altered bacteria, plants and insects are on the loose in the US. 

The absolute worst case scenario is mass extinction on a global scale, plants, fish, birds, mammals. Entire ecosystems wiped out. This technology has huge potential, and should be researched and tested before the results are fed to us."

In nature its always the fittest that survives but if u make something thats artificially been made super fit, it will be the only thing that will survive.


 This is not the first time humans hav introduced a specie where it dont belong and this time its on entire planet."

not how nature works, everything finds its balance.  people have an oversentimental or static view of nature..and thats simply wrong."

History has shown that mono-culture farms are susceptible to a single blight that can wipe out an entire nation's crop.  Plenty of examples... the Irish potato famine, the wheat blight in Africa & Asia starting in 2007, and so on."
,elite_fascism,2011-01-20T23:14Z,"Perhaps, videos like this will wake liberals to the true nature of the government that they adore, and conservatives to the true nature of corporations they defend.

The government they adore is in reality a corporation whose sole purpose is to promote the health and welfare of all of its brother, and sister corporations.  The FDA, USDA, Department of Energy are not looking out for the little guy as liberals so foolishly believe.  Corporations are not necessarily capitalist as many conservatives foolishly believe, either. 

 The mother of all whores, the Federal Reserve, owns all corporations worth owning, including Monsanto.  Abolishing the Fed is where we should start.
