Army of NONE - What the Military Recruiters Aren\'t Telling You

This is Activ8Media\'s short but highly informative video documentary Army of NONE - What the Military Recruiters Aren\'t Telling You which exposes the lies and deceits by US army recruiters who would do just about anything to get more young and stupid recruits to serve in US army. Hear for yourself what the reality is like when you become an armyman from many soldiers who after years of serving are coming out to tell the world that it\'s all a big lie. Be sure to inform yourself about the real duration of army service which extends for more years than you are being told and that you can be shipped anywhere in the world regardless of your wishes. Also the big lie about nice university schoolarships is finnally exposed as you won\'t get a penny when they are done with you. Face reality as you will discover that soldiers today are treated like cattle, trained like mad, shipped into warzones being created for interests by megacorporations and then finally dumped like trash when they are no longer needed for killing innocent civilians. Make sure you are properly informed if you wish to join the soldiers who are supposedly fighting for democracy and freedom but in the end merely serving the hungry corporate interests.
