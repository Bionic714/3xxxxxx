Synopsis: Peter LaFleur (Vince Vaughn) is a charismatic underachiever and proprietor of a rundown gym called Average Joe\'s. The facility\'s clientele of decidedly less than \"average Joes\" is made up of a self-styled pirate, a scrawny nerd who dreams of impressing an unattainable cheerleader, an obsessive aficionado of obscure sports, a dim witted young man, and a cocky know it all who, of course, really knows nothing. 
Peter\'s humble gym catches the eye of White Goodman (Ben Stiller), the power mullet sporting, Fu Manchud, egomaniacal owner of Globo Gym, a gleaming monolith of fitness. White intends to take over Average Joe\'s, and Peter\'s non existent bookkeeping is making it all too easy for him. A foreclosing bank has stationed attorney Kate Veatch (Christine Taylor) inside Average Joe\'s to finalize Globo\'s takeover of the gym. But Peter\'s boyish charms win her over and Kate joins his team of social rejects to beat the odds and their own ineptitude to try to save Average Joe\'s. How? A showdown dodgeball competition against Globo Gym
