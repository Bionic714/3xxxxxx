,ReVIsed,2006-11-12T20:09Z,ParaDogs: We've spent the past 5 years beeing polite. We got shit. Now it's time to take the gloves of. If a few moderators and sheep get upset about beeing informed on the event that triggered WW3 so be it. 
,kerson,2006-11-12T22:10Z,"WW3 yeah right, where have you been under a rock
Do you go outside with a tin foil hat on too...
Stop this shit, there is no ww3"
,ReVIsed,2006-11-12T22:28Z,kerson: Go back to sleep. You and your fellow zombies aren't really a problem anymore. We just walked all over you in the midterm elections and now we're gonna walk all over your democrat-puppets too. 
,captaind,2006-11-13T00:39Z,"well there will probably be a WW3 but 911 is not the cause or the catalyst.   The cause is well before 911, 911 is just one part of it."
,ReVIsed,2006-11-13T14:23Z,bobdaslob is a real gift. He makes the 911 truth folks look even better than they already are.
,tomtomx,2006-12-02T17:58Z,For all you REAL truth seekers out there. Don't miss Loose Change v.3 with corrections on most of the stupidities in the first two versions (and lots of the weird claims by the 911 conspiracists). Grab it for direct download at: http://www.lolloosechange.co.nr/
,AmandaYung,2007-08-23T23:54Z,"How can i get this?!

911 TRUTH!!"
,lovetoseed,2007-12-19T16:45Z,"loose change is the dogs bollocks, if you havn't seen that before, then you posts here should not be viewed."
,gomzi,2008-05-26T21:45Z,"this is a pure conspiracy about 9/11, they say that Osama did it, it was all for oil... do we all agree on that?

WW3 due to 9/11, certainly not... but yeah there will be ww3...oh god i hope i'm wrong."
[T],FaeGiN,2009-09-01T22:34Z,"Loose Change is PROVEN to be BULLSHIT.
If you trust Loose Theories, erm I mean Change, then YOU are a FOOL who does not research before believing any old shite!
And you have the audacity to call us sheeple....yawn."
