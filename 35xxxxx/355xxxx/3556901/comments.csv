The term to ""gamble"" is defined by anything that has a monitary attached to betting.

The only way poker is strictly a game of skill, and therefore fitting your specific and I would argue 'grossly mis-informed' definition would be if it were being played without the exchange of anything of monitary value, or having the ability to keep any monitary winnings.

Having said that, I feel that to say that it's somehow as a blanket statement 'not gambling' is incorrect. :-)

Would I ban it? no. Would I join you in your fight? no. Would you actually read this? no.
