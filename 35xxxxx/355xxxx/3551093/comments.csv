,royxx,2006-11-23T22:01Z,I try maps and how can I activate maps?
,kilroyj,2006-12-31T15:00Z,"Interesting map. Where did it originate from? I have yet to see this map offered by TT. None of the pre-installed ones and none of the additional maps I have heared of contain ""Germany"", the ""Alps-region"" and ""Eastern Europe"" in one big map. Perhaps TT could try to SELL this one. There is a lot of interest for such a map.

One has to take note, that the ""major roads"" in the eastern and balkan countries are few and far between. Just enough to connect a handfull of major cities, not nearly as detailed as the ones in the western countries. A typical ""all europe wall map"" contains more details than this map.

I would guess it's 99+% for Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Czech Rep: 90+%, Hungary looks pretty well populated, Poland too. Slovakia is almost empty. TT website states PL: 34%, CZ: 99%, SK 16%, HU 40% for the actual coverage in their maps. Everything else is way below 5% so don't think about going for a ride in the 
rural eastern europe.

But you can certainly not blame fransfl for that. Great torrent."
