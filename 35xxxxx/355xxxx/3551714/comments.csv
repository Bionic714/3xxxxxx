I've been looking for a complete set of this wonderful musician's beautiful works, and here you have been gracious enough to upload it.

Thank you!

Now if I get someone to share a 100% seed or 2, I would be even more grateful."
,Peter0703,2006-11-06T08:20Z,"and now we are at 99.8% and no one seeds 100%, which is, I might say, typical for the Pirate Bay"
,Timich,2006-11-07T16:17Z,"""and now we are at 99.8%"" - It is a side-effect of superseed mode. My upload speed is limited to 32 kilobytes per second (ADSL modem), so I turned it on to use bandwidth  more effectively. More info about superseeding is here:

Sadly, it is typical for users to stop seeding shortly after download. Currently, there are 4 seeders including me, but the torrent was downloaded 22 times... "
