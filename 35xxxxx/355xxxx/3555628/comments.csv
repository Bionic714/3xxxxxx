Criterion video and Masterworks audio, the best of every edition.
Thanks a lot ;-)"

Dialogue is OK but any outdoor scenes e.g. the wind on the hilltops or the splashing of the horses through the water are a slushy mess of noise! It's like there's reverb on the soundtrack.

I downloaded and burnt this without any errors so it seems DQ's fiddling with the sound hasn't paid off. Unfortunately for such a visually stunning film this spoiled the experience somewhat!"

,xas210,2009-05-29T07:22Z,"im also having serious trouble with the sound. think it's damaged - though it's very curious how it could have happened. sounds like low quality sound (32K).

might be something about the ""extra"" 5.1 sound as described in the notes for this torrent? 

does anyone know the how or why of this problem?
thanks"
