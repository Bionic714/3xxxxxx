,rodcr32,2007-10-15T21:46Z,"evangelion was considered the best anime ever made. I would add fullmetal alchemist (FMA) in the list... This is one of the two movies, apart from the series (26 episodes) "
,Xenoformen,2007-12-22T22:49Z,"This is the movie that was supposed tor replace the two last episodes. The company creating NGE became bankrupt and had to finish the series instantly without a proper ending.

This movie is made by another company and is considered the official ending of Neon Genesis Evangelion."

,Wes006,2009-11-20T10:01Z,"*DO NOT DOWNLOAD IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A ""HIGH QUALITY"" VERSION* 

I just finished downloading this and I can tell you, I am not impressed. The video quality is ""sub-par"" in my opinion. It appears that the video was recorded using a video camera and not actually ripped. Honestly, it now makes logical sense why this torrent is not well seeded. Do yourself a favor and download a ""worthwhile"" high quality rip."
