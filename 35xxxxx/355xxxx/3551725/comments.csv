,sand,2006-11-07T06:47Z,"t's possible that one needs to install the ms visual c++ package here before installing windvd8, which was written with this code.

,Olphus,2006-11-10T04:22Z,"it says I need ""microsoft directx feb2006 runtime""
when I let the InstallShield find it for me I get an error.
I can't find the exact name on microsoft's site either.
Also, must it be feb2006..."
,aka Wombat,2006-11-13T05:10Z,too bad you have to install ms visual c++ package and make sure you are running that directx but other than that it works! really was waiting for this because of the Pan and Scan widescreen function works just like a standard dvd player now I can fill my 16:9 tv to full screen on widescreen dvds!
,Lasloman,2006-12-07T18:47Z,thnx

,tonyboner,2006-12-20T22:55Z,"To install:
1- download and install the latest DirectX from Microsoft.com (or from a recent game CD)

2- download and install C++ package from

3- Unrar, run setup.exe, and use provided serial number."
,Nd4SpdSe,2006-12-24T20:03Z,"I'm getting the same error message as mortenkohler 

The module: C:program files\intervideo\common\bin\command.dll could not be registred. HRESULT -1073741795. 
"
,mactoy,2006-12-27T00:21Z,"went to the nlforce site but can't find the serial install, can somebody help "
,phusg,2006-12-28T19:11Z,"I also get the The module: C:program files\intervideo\common\bin\command.dll could not be registred. HRESULT -1073741795 error messages for about 10 .dlls. Funnily enough an official download mirror .exe gives the same result. The current official release from Intervideo 8.0.6.104 does install properly, but unfortunately this keygen doesn't seem to work with it. I also noticed that even with the official trial version the DTS isn't working properly. I'm going to try PowerDVD now as VLC just doesn't playback video as smoothly..."
,BaltBullet1,2006-12-29T15:46Z,I can't find the installation serial either because the nlforce website is not in english.
,shafiero,2007-01-24T21:28Z,"

just what i was looking for "
,Cr0nan,2007-02-13T15:51Z,thx fil76 and tonyboner!
,Cr0nan,2007-02-13T16:11Z,"i have downloaded latest ""directx"" but the ""setup.exe"" sais that i haven't got directx!!! i know i have... shitty program"
,imnok1,2007-03-15T07:26Z,"""use included serial""?  what, was this rar changed since original upload?  there_is_no_included_serial.  just this retarded ""http://www.nlforce.org"" splattered all over where a serial should be.  downloading and using the keygen or using the 3 examples shafiero provided from said keygen are not valid options seeing as how the setup asks for user name, company name, serial number, not mail, pw, license, cb #."

,xenomorph1138,2008-09-08T00:35Z,"DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!!!!!! THIS SHIT (THE SETUP FILE) WILL INSTALL (Zlob!gen.3). Norton can block it but can't get rid of it. If you find that you have this infection, start in safe mode and run system restore. Has to be in safe mode cause it won't restore in normal startup."
