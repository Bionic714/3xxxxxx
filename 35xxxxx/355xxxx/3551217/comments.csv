,oblachubs,2006-11-05T04:11Z,This is anything but HQ.  Very pixelated and the voice is out of synch with the video for more than half the vid.  Try testing it next time before uploading...
,DJ_Sooflet,2006-11-05T13:42Z,"What the hell is wrong with you people ? 

YES, OF COURSE i watched it, and for your information, the VIDEO is in ABSOLUTELY PERFECT SYNCH with AUDIO, so your ""out of synch"" problems are probably caused by BAD CODECS or SLUGGY SYSTEM.

Try following the procedure mentioned in the HELP FILE. If it won't help, then reinstall your buggy system, and start over the procedure.

And the quality is AS GOOD as IT CAN BE in a 110 MB file !! Of course it cannot be the same as in 350MB version which it was made from, but it still is EXCELLENT anyway. Watch it on a TV, and you won't see a diffrence."

,DJ_Sooflet,2006-11-10T17:54Z,"Perhaps your intelligence is of too low quality to understand somebody's hard work. It upload this files to VERY MANY sites, and everywhere else people are satisfied with the quality.

So piss off."
,DJ_Sooflet,2006-11-10T17:57Z,"BTW.

I don't understand - If you want THAT HIGH quality, then why are you downloading movies from P2P at all ? 

Order HDTV versions now and watch it on your big, wonderful HDTV screen.

Man you're a freakin retard."
