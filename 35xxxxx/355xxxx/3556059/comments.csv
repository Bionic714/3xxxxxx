its the only way i found it to work. "
,PHBFO,2006-11-12T15:40Z,Those this one has the Super 727 in it? (check dreamfleet site)
,BVT2,2006-11-12T15:42Z,"hmm,don't know yet if i'm up to reinstalling FS9 just to get the 727 working...Isn't there another way around it?
Thnx for all this work rossirep!!If there is anything to make it up to you,let me know!"
,rossirep,2006-11-12T20:43Z,"LOL - well im not sure what else to do with it to be honest, all other methods i tried lead to a crash to desktop. 


Its up to you if you want to wipe the lot just for the 727,  I like to keep fs9 nice and tidy, and re-install quite often....  messing with code i dont really understand, has been a catalyst for a few re-installs too! 

"
,rossirep,2006-11-12T20:44Z,@ PHFBO  yes this has the 727 super model in.
,cmb228,2006-11-12T21:41Z,Hopefully this one will work for me. :)
,rossirep,2006-11-12T22:25Z,"@ cmb228

if you had the original file i upped'....  that also will work on a fresh install of fs9...   its all very bizzare i cant understand what might be making it crash out on older installs of fs9. 

Dont shoot me if it doesnt work,  but i can say 100% it works with the method described above. "
