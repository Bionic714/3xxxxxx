Ok, so i\'ll try again. 

This works with fs9.1 update i tested it today. 

However for those that found the last torrent (727) crashed out to desktop on selecting the plane in the menu, (which it did to me also after re-installing it)

this was how i got this one to work... 

I started by uninstalling fs2004, and re-installing it with the update. 

Then mounted the .mdf file with powerISO and installed. 

Works absolutley fine.

Up to you if you can be bothered to spend an hour un-installing and re-installing fs2004 plus your add ons. but it works fine from a fresh install as said.

@ BVT2 - strangley, this is from the same source file as the old one. but seems to work as mentioned.
