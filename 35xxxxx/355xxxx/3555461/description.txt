Release Notes:

Yusuf's (formerly Cat Stevens) first album of modern pop songs since 1978's
Back to Earth. On his return to music, Yusuf says "I feel right about making
music and singing about life in this fragile world again. It is important for
me to help bridge the cultural gaps others are sometimes frightened to
cross."
