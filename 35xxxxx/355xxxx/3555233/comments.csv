And now for the request: Romeo and Juliet from 1968, the one directed by Franco Zeffirelli. I have no idea if this is something of the BBC but it's worth a try..."
,bobc,2006-11-12T08:51Z,"How about the BBC's Taming of the Shrew, with John Cleese?"
,nikko1,2006-12-06T20:00Z,"oh wow. thanks.

,tauro57,2008-07-27T01:46Z,"Thanks Daniel.  This is REALLY great stuff.  Do you have the Michael Horden [as King Lear] version ?
Thanks"
,PenniesOS,2009-08-07T13:58Z,"I'm going to have a day of Lear if I can get this from any seeders who are still graciously seeding......?

My plan of attack then is to start with James Earl Jonesl, move on to Paul Scofield, then hit up Laurence Olivier, then Godard & Kurosawa's interpretations, then listen to both John Gielgud & Alec Guinness's audio adaptations and finally finish with Iam MacKellen's '08 version.

Cheers in advance all!"
