"
,notenough,2008-11-10T14:16Z,"Well I'm seeding what I have of this so if anyone else wants to be stuck at 95.1% with me then they're welcome to do so.
"
,notenough,2008-11-17T06:39Z,"As I sit here watching some other sucker download this I find myself thinking that it's probably just cruel for me to seed it knowing that they'll never get past 95.1% unless the original poster completes the seed.

Anyone know of a way to contact the poster?"
