This is a collection of books that I frequently consult in my job as an IT professional. 99% of these books are computer related. Most books contain practical information though some are of a more theoretical (computer science) nature.

95% of these books are no more than 3-4 years old. Some books date as far back as 1992. These books are included because nothing better has been written since then on that particular subject.

I delete most certification books as these age too fast. The same is true of most books about specific software packages.

To find out if this is worth downloading, only download the /html directory first. and check out if the titles are anything for you.

The original file names have not been retained, as no common naming convention exist, and I need to access these files on several operating systems. The only way to use these files is through the html catalogue, or to go in and rename the files.

Some directories have been zipped to limit the size of the torrent file - everyt
hing name [publishing house].ZIP should be unzipped before attempting to use the
 those particular books.
