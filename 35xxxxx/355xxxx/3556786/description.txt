2hour movie - one hour of talk/strategy and 1 hour pure battle. Lots of smoke and many extras (mostly Russian extras, I expect). Famous actors. This is a movie from 1970 - so don┬┤t expect a lot of FX/or animation. Most of the movie is historically correct (according to accounts). Actin a bit questionable though. Was never a box office hit
