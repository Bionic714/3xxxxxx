Do you have the other seasons too?"
,zoneone,2006-11-24T20:03Z,"Ok, here's the deal:
I found these episodes on another tracker.. and I downloaded 100% of it.
They match the hash checking of _this_ torrent, but still I can't get higher than 99.8%.
The three eps that doesn't complete seem to work anyways. (Haven't watched every minute of them, though.)
If the original seeder doesn't join in, 99.8 is probably as much as you will get."
,heavypredator,2006-11-24T23:25Z,wich ones are not 100% - i will download them somewhere else. and i cant check in my torrent client so thx.
,zoneone,2006-11-25T02:33Z,"Ep 5, 10 and 14 are stuck just below 100% in my client...
But I think they're actually OK anyways. Watch them and see for yourself. :)"
,heavypredator,2006-11-25T19:56Z,"ep 5 just hunged will try to fast forward a little.
looks like lost few minutes."
