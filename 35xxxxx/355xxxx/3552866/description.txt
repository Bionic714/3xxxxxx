Family drama about how life changes when a traveling 
sideshow exhibitionist enters Granger, Texas displaying 
possibly the fattest boy ever, Zachary Beaver. 
The changes don't come because of Zachary but instead 
they just happened to occur when he enters town. 
One family breaks apart when the mother leaves to become 
a country singer. Another family has a member go into 
the Army, and Zachary's partner and legal guardian disappears. 
At this point, Toby from the 1st family, 
and Cal from the 2nd try to get to know Zachary. 
First as a joke and later more seriously because of 
their own personal losses. We get to see Toby try to 
grow up despite not being in the best of circumstances 
and as things get worse he tries to escape but obviously can't. 
An interesting story with inconsistent acting and direction 
makes for a so-so experience in what could have been a much 
better movie. Attempts are made to pull at our heartstrings 
but even Sasha Neulinger's appealing portrayal of Zachary 
can't help the movie from falling a little flat.
