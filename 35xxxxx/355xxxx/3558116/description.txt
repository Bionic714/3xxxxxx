Great Game from 1997!


Beasts and Bumpkins is a real time strategy game. It tells the story of Lord Mildew (your alter ego!), a poor member of the royal family, that has been thrown away from his country.

Your task is to complete over 30 missions in order to regain your former reputation. You┬┤ll have to set up prospering towns in order to gain wealth, which is necesary to supply an army. With your army, you┬┤ll have to defend your villages against beasts amd other evil folks.

The gameplay can be compared with Blizzard┬┤s Warcraft, althouth it lacks a lot of its qualities.
