Go to your cd-rom drive:right cklick on the cone  Setup.exe -) properties -) compatibility -) run under win95.

Now the setup will run under win95 emu. and the regkeys will be inserted normally.


the problem was that xp not could reg it correct but now its run under win95 and going to work!"

,bonglebongle,2007-11-19T04:46Z,"Old torrent I know, but... could someone seed please?
I've tried the download from underdogs but can't get it to run properly, would like to try this one.
Thanks."
,Dwarming,2007-12-08T14:24Z,"I couldn't realy understand what you were getting at earlier.
So letme just ask, do you have to have the CD to run this torrent when it is installed?.. Or what was all the previous talk about?"
,Dwarming,2007-12-08T20:13Z,"I have the problem with the screen turning black as well. The game seems to be starting, but after a few seconds it just freezes. 
I have set the setup and the game exe file to run in Win95. 

If i need an ISO or bin file to mount an image, where would i get one of those?
Running it with the CD is out of the question, cause there is no chance i can get my hands on a copy.

Some1 please help me, i have missed this game so much, and i cant belive that i finaly found a working version (almost)"
