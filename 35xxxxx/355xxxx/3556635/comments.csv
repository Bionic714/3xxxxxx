,Bule1976,2006-11-25T03:10Z,Sadly enough they stopped subbing naruto. Eps 210 will be the last one. :(
,thegardners42,2006-11-25T18:32Z,"I have begun downloading this series, and one of the files finished last night. I checked it quickly this morning, and got only audio, no video. I suspect I am missing a codec, but I have no idea which one it might be.

Any insight?"
,Duskeren,2006-11-26T00:00Z,"Bule1976
No its a Troll, theres no Naruto this week, so they think its funny to trick ya into thinking they stopped. ( in the ""news"" on the DB page, note the * at the title. Read the buttom then.  *YHBT. YHBT == You have been trolled. So dont worry, next week theres more Naruto! :D

there IS indeed english Naruto running on Cartoon Network, but this is the Subbed versions."

,juggalo_pirate,2006-12-27T09:34Z,"if u cant watch them with the video player u are using try vlc player (if you dont have it yet). i have hundreds of .avi files and it play's them all just fine. i recommend this not only for this but other .avi's also. (this is not an advertisement im just informing people of the player i use without problems). if you'd like the web site for it you can search it in yahoo or email me at psyco_tweek@kornkids.com. once again this is not and ad just an informative comment after reading all the ""it wont play"" comments. i havent downloaded this yet but plan to after i get some space cleared on my hd, so count on me gettin to it soon."

,kungk3,2008-03-04T23:56Z,which program is every1 useing to seed???
,digital_apocalypse,2008-04-03T23:25Z,"From BoxTorrents: ""WARNING: completly disregard all episodes after 147 (except 216-220) as well as 101-106. These are completly pointless filler episodes with no significance to the plot whatsoever and are often painful to watch.  They were created because the anime got dangerously close to catching up with the manga and their purpose was to let the manga get further ahead.  The main story atcually ended at 135, but episodes 141, 142, and 220 contain slight bits of story but each episode is embedded in a 5 or 6 episode filler mini arc. WATCH THE FILLER AT YOUR OWN RISK!!!!"""

,Ohmstar,2008-11-24T06:50Z,"Thanks for this great torrent! I've got the US release DVDs as they've come out, but I needed to get the OVAs (aside from the one included with Ninja Clash in the Land of Snow). But does anyone know where I can find the OVA that was released with the PS2 game Naruto: Ultimate Ninja 3. I know the OVA is mostly just about the video game, but I'd still like to see it once, just to be complete."

As soon as it finishes downloading, I'll seed it for a pretty long time. =3 Thanks for putting this up here; was finding it kinda hard to find the whole series, as far as it goes. I realize there's probably quite a few more, considering this was uploaded back in '06, but at least it'll help get me caught up! X3"
