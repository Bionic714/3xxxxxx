,ImpiousAngell,2010-05-15T02:45Z,"Ducati you are my hero - this is an amazing and epic collection. Great quality, clean download. HIGHLY recommended to anyone into ""old school"" trance. I will seed for at least 6 mo. Thanks to all you seeders too only took me about 3 hrs to DL. SWEET!"
,TranceJunky78,2010-09-12T10:02Z,"the quality is below average and im happy with 190 kbps. Im listening right now and its pissing me off quite honestly. All these ""blips"" and high pitched screeches in the sound. Wouldnt be a big deaL if this was like 1 cd.. but damn! Its not shiddy on every track but its an overall grade ""A"" dipshi t upload..Don't get me wrong theres nothing like getting free torrents, but sub-par anything is for douchebagz. Trust me, coming from a dude who is NOT picky about sound (i prefer NOT to have 320kbps, too much memory) as long as its good overall. What I'm saying is, dont download this. "
,TranceJunky78,2010-09-12T10:04Z,all these other comments must have been put in b4 they actually heard the music. the only good thing about this torrent is the track/album selection.
,Pimp666,2012-06-16T16:56Z,Fucking right! Nice work man!
