,willynillyking,2009-09-18T17:28Z,"Can I get a seed on this, please?  I would truly appreciate it, and I would continue to seed.  Please :)"
[V],Kuthumi,2010-12-26T17:17Z,"I downloaded this in 2006 and today  that it has run dry of seeders. Managed to restore the files from my burned disc, seeding now. Merry Christmas! 
This is a PAL version. If you don't need the subtitles, try this 700 Mb rip:

[V],Kuthumi,2010-12-26T17:49Z,"That came out wrong. Should have been: I downloaded this in 2006 and DISCOVERED today that it has run dry of seeders. Managed to restore the files from my burned disc, seeding now. Merry Christmas!"
[V],Kuthumi,2010-12-29T09:03Z,"This has become a very rare torrent. Please be prepared to seed to a ratio of at least 1:1, and do not leave the swarm with less than 2 seeders. My intention to save the torrent was to keep it alive, not make it prey to vultures who just hit and run."
