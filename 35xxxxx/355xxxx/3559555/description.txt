These are tracks I\\\'ve culled from various blogs over the past year or so. It\\\'s mostly electro and techno, with some house and other styles I\\\'m not sure how to describe. Most are aac, a few are >160kbps mp3. Also, for DJs, most of them are complete versions, but there are one or two that came from mix CDs so another track comes in at the end. Anyway, these are absolutely the best tracks I found after sorting through A LOT of stuff, so enjoy!
