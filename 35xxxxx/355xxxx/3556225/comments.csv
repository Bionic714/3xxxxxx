,deafblob,2006-12-03T03:35Z,"this isnt ""Comet, Butterfly and Sword"", this is just ""Butterfly and Sword"". the difference being the last bit cut out of ""Butterfly and Sword"", which really changes the ending.

also the english dubbing robs it of everything i liked about the version ive seen before. id reccomend finding another version or watching with the sound off and finding subtitles for it."
