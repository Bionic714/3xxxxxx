,djsiryn,2006-11-15T18:29Z,"Hi everyone, I am sorry for some of the probs. I am going to write instructions for how to install these files. Just give me a little while here. 
 Thanks"
,colimodio,2006-11-15T20:18Z,"Cool...the way to do it...It needs a key in the registry

Using the first unwrapper, called  -deflorator-, the green Flight1- DOS prompt. You get to make a ""fake"" key , Offline, then it will mark the register with the kay, you can call it dumbbass or anything. Then it unwraps to Project Sierra Hotel Folder and installs T-37v20.

This is a 3 download plane. The main file (for FS2002) and 2 uodates for FS9 (1.03 and 1.04)

Maybe and faster to downoad it from http://www.t37sim.com/

good flying, though...."
,djsiryn,2006-11-15T20:50Z,The registry file can be double clicked to write the key to the registry. As fro t not detecting fs 2004 or 2002 I cant seem to figure that one out unless the fs folder has been moved or the registry is invalid for it. I'll keep on it tho.
,colimodio,2006-11-15T22:05Z,"Here's an idea...use the deflorator...it unwraps the wrapper and puts everything right...this T-37 is one complicated bird otherwise. I advise you to fool proof install it using the deflorator.

So again, download the wrapper from http://www.t37sim.com/ along with the 2 updates, and install it right. What djsiryn is decribing is an incomplete RIP and with flight1 wrappers, it doesnt always work.

Mine is perfect, and the tweet flies in two variations. The MDL file is a new one over 3MB!!"
