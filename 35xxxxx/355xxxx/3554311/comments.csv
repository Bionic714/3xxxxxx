Hope you read this alltough your question is three month old :-)
When an uploaded DVD is greater than what a normal DVD+R can take, it is a DVD9, i.e. an exact copy of the printed DVD, which is dual layer and can take up to 8.5 Gb.
This is great, it means that you can choose between keeping menues, extras, subs, credits etc., or optimizing for quality. You can even use a dual layer disc and get it all, but they are expensive.
To shrink the film according to your own mode you need DVD Shrink, which is freeware, and probably the best freeware in the world :-)

While your at it: download DVD Decrypter, RipIt4Me and you have your DVD kit.
