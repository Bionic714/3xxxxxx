ActiveSky Version 6.5 has been released and includes full FSX support!

ASv6.5 also includes FSX native flight-plan file import support, official FSUIPC v4 support, and several changes to ensure the best possible experience using AS with FSX.  Of course FS2004 is still fully supported as well!  Users having both simulator versions installed can easily run either one at any time with full ASv6.5 weather generation.

ASG and AR, 2 bundled components that are included with ASv6 and v6.5, are not compatible with FSX due to significant technology differences which requires completely new FSX-based solutions.  These new FSX-based solutions are already being developed with more news and status on them to be made available very soon.


very latest version and build, for both FS2004 and FSX! also inclused the latest ActiveSky Graphics

enjoy!
