,4X-AXG,2006-11-10T11:40Z,"hey rexxyboy, thanks for such a great comment again..but I'm guessing since this is the very latest version build, the link you're giving is seeding an older version than this one"

,Xervish,2006-11-10T14:06Z,"Hey thanks for this. How do I install it for FSX? When I go to install this it gives me the default install directory as FS2004. I dont know where I need to install this for FSX.

Thanks."

,macman4,2006-11-10T17:46Z,"Xervish. Just install it to the default FS9. then when you start up AS go to options and click ""start paused"". then start up FS9 or FSX dosent matter. Then go to AS and click on refresh. It will give you the weather for which ever flight sim you started. You must have FSUIPC installed in both FS9 and FSX. I think the latest version is 4.0.1.0"

,Rexxxifon,2006-11-11T03:04Z,"Hey 4x-axg You missed the point.  Now there's 2 torrents of the same thing being seeded.  Which increases the chances that it will die sooner.

People need to use the search function before making new torrents of the same files, it's a waste of time to post something that's already posted, and been downloaded hundreds of times, and is STILL being seeded.

As for that version being older? Not really, download that one, head to the Hifisim site and Boom, download the latest update. Sounds simple to me."

,C2007,2006-11-15T22:43Z,"Rexxxifon >> I'll rather install a full version of 6.5 then install 6.0 and the going trough some updates. And i think your (old version) will die first. :-)

Thats it! "

,jabbaru,2007-03-27T23:23Z,"Hmmm... this dont seem right..

during install:

""The feature you are trying to use is on a network resource this is unavailable"" ( false as its on my C and D drives ) 
""Click OK to try again, or enter an alternate path to a folder containing the installation package 'activesky version 6 and activesky graphics.msi' in the box below"" meaning the browse option, well i have the Activesky 6 installation package too and guess what, dont work, havent seen anyone on thins torrent that has confirmed it working, im inclined to agree with Rexxxifon and stick to version 6"
,jabbaru,2007-03-28T19:21Z,"C2007, good luck.."
,jabbaru,2007-03-28T23:35Z,"have version 6 downloaded the update, 2 mins, installed and ready to 5 mins,,.. not sure what the big fuss was C2007... good tip Rexxy..

unless you advise otherwise, but first I need a little seeding help from your loyal followers.

Thanks soo much for the great upload :)> 

BTW, can anyone suggest where I can purchase some used HW (peddles, etc..) to play these little gems more efficently?"
