,Malvadao,2006-11-15T05:48Z,quality? source?
,ZinZaH,2006-11-15T11:27Z,"I checked out the sample, and that seems to be DVD quality.. I will post back after dl'ing the whole movie to verify.."
,Nascarjunkie,2006-11-15T13:26Z,Hay guy's the file only go's to 94.3 % so who wants to download this file and wait for day's for the other 6%

,Gestalt,2006-11-15T15:29Z,"judging by the filename, it's Saw III TELESYNC XViD-PUKKA."

,mrgaay,2006-11-15T23:33Z,"its good you got a fast out-connection.. i'm downloading at the speed 4 kb/ps from you, and i got fast internet.. weel i'm waiting for it to go a little bit faster, becouse this is the best torrent i found.."
,jansson_cold,2006-11-16T05:08Z,"Quality suck... it is not DVD-Quality. you guys should watch and learn from ""aXXo"" tha man...... not a single of his work is less than great. peace out"
,JohnBaez,2006-11-16T07:08Z,"Sure aXXo ""is the man"", when it comes to movies that are already available on dvd...he ROCKS ! that doesn't mean I dont appreciate him because I do. I'm guessing he works at Blockbuster Video cuz I use to manage one and we always got are movies way in advance before renting to the public. My point is that this movie is still in the theater and we get to see it and it looks decent, so i'm not complaining or being ungrateful to someone who took their time  to upload this for us."
,korhal,2006-11-16T23:20Z,why do you dont write it come from pukka?
,swe_84,2006-11-17T13:10Z,lilgox use vlc then you dont ned any codec
,Drunken Munkey,2006-11-17T19:05Z,"Take a chill pill or something, yes just type in ""VLC media player"" into Google. You don't really need to bitch at the uploader or anyone unless they bitch at you. All you have to do is ask and I'm sure there's plenty of helpful people on here.

Anyway, just beginning to download now, I'll continue to seed afterwards if it's working (which I'm sure it will, judging by the positive comments).

Thanks a lot xxx1001, you're the best :)"
