,parri,2006-11-30T14:23Z,"@PIMPIT!
You need a modded xbox.
When you have one you can either extract the iso and ftp the files to your xbox or burn the iso and play from disc.

,ajoharibelgium,2006-12-09T14:50Z,Can anyone confirm this works on NTSC and that its in english?
,tjenare_grabben,2006-12-09T16:14Z,"this is english yes,, dont know that NTSC means sorry :) BUT... when i try to copy this game to my hdd it says couldnt copy 1 files blabla try clean disc.. I've tryied this with 3 dvd's now and I get the same result everytime.. So something is wrong with this :) 
"
,ajoharibelgium,2006-12-12T01:06Z,I found Projectx's uploads generally the best uploads to bad they have such a small variety. I would appretiate if they can get som more James bond games on the site. :) just a suggestion.
,ajoharibelgium,2006-12-12T01:10Z,grabben its probably a bad file download if you find out which file it is you can download that one file using utorrent. Then replace it with the exsisting file then burn it to a disc it should work 1 time every time then :) just a trick i learned.

,beagla,2007-02-01T16:14Z,I have a similar problem as others... i burned it with dvd-decrypter. then i tried to use it but it does not go on either Pal or Ntsc (using switch disc) But if i go on to the disc i can start the multiplayer (live and such) but not the single mode.... clues? or ideas?
,poppe59,2007-02-05T18:06Z,"why does it say that it is dirty or damaged is it so with all games, this game worked very long but now when i have played maybe 15 missions it say that is damaged or dirty. why is it so??????

,Markytho,2008-05-08T22:30Z,Thanks for this and I hope that I can get all of this.
,XxGLITCHxX,2008-06-12T02:11Z,"Download the files (RAR ARchives)

Extract the px-cod.rar (this will extract ALL of the files into an ISO)

An ISO is a CDIMAGE this one is about 4-5Gig's in size,

If you dont have a DVD burner but an Xbox softmodded, you can extract the ISO using xISO (dont worry its free!) there will be 5 files

Media (FOLDER) and the 4 .xbe's, FTP into your Xbox in F:\Games or where ever you store your games....


Now delete CACHE data in the directories 

""X/Y/Z"" and also in ""E:\CACHE\LOCAL.BIN delete everything in thoes folders

Once that is done, make sure you dont have a gamesave! 

Once you clear everything. it will load the game without the ""This disc maybe damaged or dirty""

Have fun :D"
