,madsen-anker,2006-11-14T12:43Z,"You are the best, thx"
,stockholm,2006-11-17T18:46Z,"well..you are supposed to copy the updater to the main directory. but it's not possible to copy that file. so this program doesn't work.
correct me if i'm wrong."
,hunnilover,2006-11-20T06:45Z,"don't copy the updater to the main directory instead double click it, ""kill spy sweeper"" and untick box then download defs."
,blablayadayada,2006-11-25T01:54Z,"WARNING!!!

DON'T download this torrent! I did, since I wanted to fully test it, I had only seen friends who used this, and it seemed like a very good program. However, I still downloaded it and all was well. Installed the program, so far so good, and after the installation procedure the help file said you should reboot, and so I did, but after that, it said you should extract the updater to the main program folder.

That's wen the fun started. I couldn't, no matter how I tried, so read the comments on this torrent. I tried the instructions hunnilover posted, started the updater and then nothing happened. I started Windows Task Manager and it showed me that the updater was not responding. Perfect!

 Tried to reboot, but it didn't work, so I decided to uninstall Spy Sweeper, no problems with that, but when I tried to remove my updater program, which I extracted to a temporary folder, it wouldn't just go away. I tried and I tried, and eventually, after an hour or so, I finally succeded. Whew!

Never again!!!

DON'T download this torrent! If you want this program so badly, try another torrent and/or tracker!"
,stockholm,2006-11-28T19:26Z,"thank you hunnilover for trying to help me out. but the updater just does not work. so i consider this download useless.
until somebody tells me how to make the updater work."

,Shnoky,2006-12-07T06:33Z,well a fair warning to you downloaders. this version of spysweeper will cripple your system. down degrade your system it wil look like pentium 1. the versions 4 and 4.5 were great. the best there is in the net at certain time. but this one sucks! dont bother installing this. 
,Sashco,2006-12-13T18:14Z,"how about you pay lousy 29.95$ for the software and quit moaning about it! If you ask me, the softwear is cheap compared to all other crap that is out there..."
,FarmerboyfromTown,2007-01-14T22:21Z,"Anybody able to copy the ""Spy Sweeper Updater 2.0.0 Alpha 4000 Updater"" or the ""Spy Sweeper Updater 2.0.0 Beta 5000 Updater"" to the main programs folder? I get the message ""Cannot copy Spy Sweeper Updater 2.0.0 Beta 5000 Updater: Access is denied"", any solutions for that problem or how shpuld I copy it to there? Is the webroot folder the main folder or the spy sweeper folder the main folder, anyway I cannot copy the update file either of these. PLEASE HELP!!!"

,leafgreen,2007-03-30T23:41Z,"Did you read the comment by blablayadayada? Scares you huh? Now, search for the most popular Registry Mechanic torrent. Guess what you'll find: another scary comment by ""jadajadajada"". Hmmm looks real similar. And looks like blablayadayada works for Webroot! Ah, well, after 5000+ dls, I guess he's full of shit."
,strigoicaine,2007-06-16T13:24Z,"guys its easy, just download the latest version from webrooter -  version 5.3.2 build 9** and use the serials here in this torrent, works perfect just install and hey presto - no copying updater folders etc just dload, install, use key and BAM! done.........
