'Who Needs Actions When You've Got Words' is the debut album from British grime sensation, Plan B. Fusing elements of hip-hop, grime and rock into a an aggressive sonic mixture, and bringing to mind artists as diverse as Skinnyman, Rage Against The Machine and Public Enemy, this is a UK hip-hop album that truly defies classification. Includes the singles 'Sick 2 Def' and 'Missin' Links'.
