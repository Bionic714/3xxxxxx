,Rarlitensael,2006-11-26T17:43Z,"Having problems with the newer games I downloaded, this game (Marvel:ultimate alliance) among others.

When trying to run them from the HDD they just show the evolution x loading screen for a while and then throw me back out to the launcher. A reboot instead of the game starting up... Is this a copyprotection and are my problems due to not having the right patch? DoesnÂ´t anyone else have this problem? How do I fix it?

Anyone wanna help a noob out? It would really be appreciated.

Thanx to goose33 for a great upload."

Have you tried changing your xbox from PAL/NTSC to other?

Some games only work with one.

Or you could have a corrupt file."
