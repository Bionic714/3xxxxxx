,Rockenstein,2006-11-10T04:28Z,"The file extension was missing on this file, but I guessed .rar and was right. Easily fixed.

The patch for AnyDVD appeared to be in French, with the instructions in yet another language, but whoever made the instructions was kind enough to include screenshots. I thought the patch was failing, but it appears to have worked.

Patching CloneDVD was a little bit different, but again the screenshots in the instructions pointed me in the right direction. 

CloneDVD and AnyDVD both appear to be working, I'm testing them now. I haven't installed CloneCD yet, but imagine it will work like these appear to.

Nice upload! "
