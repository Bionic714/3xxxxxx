These 16 prime cuts represent the best of Jean Carn\\\'s career. Her most successful record, the floating \\\"Closer Than Close,\\\" written by Terry Price and Brandi Wells, and produced by Grover Washington, Jr. for Omni Records, didn\\\'t stop until it hit the top of the R&B charts on August 2, 1986, where it remained for two weeks. This collection also includes her duet with Michael Henderson, \\\"Valentine Love,\\\" and moving remakes of \\\"If You Don\\\'t Know Me by Know,\\\" \\\"Love Don\\\'t Love Nobody,\\\" and \\\"Ain\\\'t No Way.\\\" The popular \\\"Don\\\'t Let It Go to Your Head\\\" and \\\"Free Love\\\" are on board, as well as a rare O\\\'Jays production: the emotional \\\"My Love Don\\\'t Come Easy.\\\" ~ Andrew Hamilton, All Music Guide
