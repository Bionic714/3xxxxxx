,Rzza,2006-11-07T20:51Z,Stupid Bullshit Propaganda to make things easy for America and the West to continue wars for oil.
,shooosh,2006-11-07T21:33Z,"Actually it's quite on target.  Islam worships death and violence, the US is catching on but Europe is darn near lost already.  Anyway, the US is the richest nation that has ever existed - we can buy all the oil we could possibly ever need, or just start using our own; we have plenty."
,baterista,2006-11-11T12:05Z,"Let me just point out to you that the same thing could be said about a lot of christians -- often the very same christians that have a propensity for muslim-bashing: no tolerance for other people's mode of living, a will to dominate and have everything their own way, and last but not least a sort bent way of interpreting the Bible to their own needs (and there's of course more, but I won't bore you with the details). Whether your a Jew, Christian or Muslim doesn't matter much. Or an aetheist for that matter. It's whether your a moron or not, and let me tell you there are quite a few examples of those in this debate right here on TPB. "
,baterista,2006-11-13T10:05Z,"""Islam did not spread through evangelism or through its natural appeal, but through aggressive wars of conquest."" Well, how do you think christianity spread? If you think that christianity is in itself a peaceful religion, think again and read perhaps a few chapters of the old bible. Aetheist as I am, I am about to start praying to God that the moron, wherever he may hide, be persecuted with bolts of lightning, because I really can't stand these self-serving bunch of assholes anymore. Where's my nuclear bomb?

OK, I'm calm now, sorry everybody. I guess I'm the biggest idiot here, since I care at all. What do you think is best: If we in the so-called West start behaving like the murderous bigots that encourage and plan acts of terrorism, or if we try take sides with the ""moderate muslims"" (who, by this documentary don't exist) and at least try to understand one another? Actually, first we'd have to stop behaving like murderous bigots, because that's what USA has been doing ever since 1945. Who turned Iran from a struggling democracy into a shah-run dictatorship that gave the USA the oil they wanted? USA, more specifically the CIA. They were proud of it aswell. If not for the CIA, my bet is that Iran would have been a tad more moderate. The problem isn't one side or the other as this documentary claims, it's the multitude of morons everywhere.

I suggest Muslims and those who may take offense to just ignore the comments and this torrent as you will also promote in seeding it if you download.

Each being chooses their own path in life. Those who are firm in their beliefs, whatever that may be, does not taunt what other people believe in order to affirm their own faith to themselves. 

Only those, whose faith is shaky would strike at all others not because they think what they believe is right... but rather because they think everyone else is wrong.

Let people like shoosh and Lensman believe in whatever they believe in (including history from... I wonder where he got the facts...). If they want to continue to be the ignorant and arrogant people they are, it is their choice in life. 
Respect their choice and let them remain ignorant and arrogant if they so wish.

As for people who are respectful of others' beliefs, don't force what you believe on them. The thing is, if they can believe in what you believe, they'd join you in the first place.

The key to global tolerance is not to have a mutual understanding but to understand instead that nothing is mutual.

During the colonial era, the muslim countries were FORCED to adopt european standards, etc. etc. In this regard, I think the US can agree, having had to win independence from an European country (Britain) once upon a time.

Its narrated by many scholars - and an ex muslim bomber, who has woken up to his actions!

Listen carefully to how he explains how Muslims can lie at will, as it says so in their book.

And how they are never going to stop until the world says Allah is God and Mohammad is his messenger. And they do mean it.

But funniest (if something can be funny here), is that he explains that Mohammad WAS A PEDOPHILE!

Yes, you read that correctly. He took a 9 YEAR OLD GIRL FOR HIS WIFE.

,hielo999,2008-01-24T23:44Z,When did Christians start beheading muslims?
,HuneyMunster,2008-01-28T07:16Z,"hielo, take a brief look into history, the Spanish Inquisition - Christins forced the Muslims of Spain to convert and to be baptised. They made them to eat pork, and did all sorts of atrocities to them. They were killed in numbers as if it were a mass genocide. This was the result of King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella taking rule over Spain - and they were Christians, so does Christianity teach to do those things? 
Some things that some Muslims may do isn't always Islamic, but ppl get the wrong idea, just because they see some Muslims do such things. Another thing ppl need to differentiate when judging, is what is Islam and what is cultural Islam? 
A lot of ppl unfortunately think that honour killings and forcing a girl to wear the head scarf is from Islam, when they couldn't be further from the truth! 
But, ppl will go onto Anti-Islamic web sites and take verses out of contexts, or hadiths that are mistranslated, and not looking at the historical signifcance of when and for what reason the specific verse or hadith was said, and say, 'ohhh look ur so called effin peaceful religion bla bla bla and more crap' *sigh*
You don't have to become a Muslim to acknowledge the facts, the true facts in history, the true facts about a religion. 

And about the ppl taking things out of context issue, a lot of non-Muslims whine and say 'Oh all u Muslims keep moaning on and saying we take things out of context, but it clearly states this or it clearly states that' Well, I would argue in Poetry for example, in Romantic Poetry and others it is often necessary to learn the historical time period before being able to analyze the poem, you have to know the situation. 
And as I mentioned before, some translations are not very correct, and so ppl get the wrong meaning..also some anti-Islamic sites may twist things, they try to brainwash you, that is their aim, they're not exactly for Islam are they. 
And so, my advice would be to look at both sides, if you are fair and happen to read from those anti-Islam websites, then, look at the Muslim responses to their allegations, which are often debunked well, and see for urself , have an open mind. 
And know that any talk, any article seeks to brainwash u in a way, or to teach you for want of a better euphism, it seeks to 'mind-set' you.

,thamonindew,2008-02-05T23:14Z,"I'm a documentary filmmaker who's Jewish. I know some of you simpletons out there are expecting me to back this film because ""Jews hate Muslims and they're bitter enemies"" Of course, you simpletons have probably never met neither a Jew or Muslim in your life, hence why you think this film is anything but a complete hack-job.

This is a doc for people who have already made up their minds that ""Islam is evil"" and ""Muslims are our enemy"" without actually studying Islam in an objective fashion (reading evilislam.com doesn't count as objective, sorry)

It is the Islamic version of those anti-semitic films most of us Chosen Folks are familiar with that are produced by Neo-Nazi groups. It takes quotes from the Qu'ran completely out of context (ie - it quotes the Qu'ran as saying ""Jews (in general) are apes"" when in fact this passage is from the Islamic version of the book of Exodus, and that passage is talking about the Jews who practiced idolotry while Moses grabbed the ten commandments from the top of mount Sinai, if you wanted to, you could do the same hack job in the bible - you could say that since the bible tells the same story and refers to those specific people as ""heathens"" than the bible is saying that all Jews are heathens . . .

Expect this level of terrible scholarship or outright distortion from this film. Either the makers are completely ignorant of Islam (in which case, as a filmmaker, what the hell are you doing making a film about subject you don't know anything about?) or they're DELIBERATELY misleading their audience (again, what kind of a doc-filmmaker does that?)

The speakers are horrible as well:

Walid Shoebot - Was a Jew-hating Palestinian terrorist, before he switched sides and became a Christian and re-directed the same hate towards Muslims. In fact, much of what he says about Muslims now is similar to what he said about Jews in the past. Considering he hasn't been deported or charged unlike other Palestinian terrorists found living in the US, his new views seem to be keeping him in Uncle Sam's good books, which makes you wonder how sincere he's being, or if it's an act to stay out of jail.

Robert Spencer - Takes the worst examples of Islam, leaves out anything positive (and yes, sorry, there is much positive), takes quotes out of context - pretty much writes about Islam the way the Klan writes about Jews. But since it's publicly acceptable to be racist towards Muslims, unlike us Jews, he is able to make a joke of a career out of his amateur scholarship.

Bat Ye'Or - A good scholar of Jewish history in Muslim lands, however she doesn't keep things in context in making judgements such as ""Jews were treated like crap in Medieval Islamic countries"" - As bad as it was for Jews in say, Morocco in 1600, it was a hell of a lot better than being a Jew living in Christian Europe at the same time. After all, my family had to flee Spain to what is now Poland once the Moors were driven out by the Catholics, because of the Inquisition, which killed Jews who wouldn't forcibly convert to Christianity. So if Muslims are evil towards Jews because of this history, why not Christians? The answer is we should realize that the world IN GENERAL was anti-semetic for us and still is in many places, and up until after WWII for the most part, the best place to live for a Jew was a place like Seville in Moorish Spain, or Istanbul under the Ottomans.

These are the kinds of speakers in this film. A film that if it treated Judaism the way it treats Islam, would certainly be called an false, anti-semitic piece of propaganda.

If you really want to learn about Islam, go pick up no god but God by Reza Aslan (you've seen him on the Daily Show & Colbert Report, he is the Middle East expert for ABC News) great book written by a young guy who actually has degrees in and has taught religion. And an excellent writer as well."
,melwakil,2008-02-27T15:03Z,"Hitler was Christian and was the sun of a Christian priest. Does it make sense, saying that Christianity encourages genocides? 

Many Catholic priests were proven guilty of child molestation. Can we say that this is a Catholic Christian tradition?

The Christian crusaders, fighting in the name of the cross, committed cannibalism. Does that mean that Christianity calls for cannibalism?

Almost naked women are in display in the red district of Amsterdam, Netherlands. Many of the sex workers there are white slaves. Does Christianity approve that?

According to the UN statistics, domestic violence in the west far exceeds domestic violence in the Middle East countries. Is domestic violence a Christian doctrine?

Islam called for liberating slaves. African Americans were enslaved by a papal bull from Pope Nicholas V.

Muslim countries harbored the Jew, while there were laws in nearly every single European country dehumanizing them. For example, while Christian Hitler was slaughtering Jews in Germany, Egypt, a Muslim country, had a Jewish member of its cabinet.

If the bad actions of some members of that society is considered to be reflecting the merits of that society, then Christianity would be the most evil social/religious system human kind had ever knew"
,rockstar11998,2008-03-05T17:43Z,Early so called Christians did do to Muslims what Muslims did to nonbelievers/Christians centuries ago.  Neither were right to kill someone if they wouldn't follow their belief system.  The big difference is that the Muslims are following the old law of the Bible that did allow for killing of nonbelievers.  The new/higher law set forth by Jesus Christ took away forced punishments and executions.  So those early so called Christians were following the same beliefs as the top Islamic leaders of today. (kill the nonbelievers)  Islam does preach that is ok to kill the nonbelievers today.  All of the Muslims thinking/saying otherwise are deceived or liars.  There are peaceful Muslims and Christians but the core of Islam is Jihad - forcing others to convert or they must die.
,rockstar11998,2008-03-05T18:43Z,I have to add one more comment.  Those religious leaders that did kill for the sake of Christianity many years ago were not following the tenants set forth in the new testament.  They were corrupt men seeking power and influence.  Anyone that doesn't believe there was an apostasy is either uninformed or seeking to deceive others.  King Henry himself refused to obey the doctrine of no divorce and yet he ran a whole empire that forced others to practice the Protestant faith.  I'm not Catholic because they had similar leaders that did the same thing.
