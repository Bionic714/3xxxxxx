,jayne_jade,2008-02-11T16:51Z,i would just like to say im a huge fan of michaels and 1 person like Demorgon who cares what u think michael rocks 
,billymunster,2008-06-13T17:06Z,i find people utterly sad! if you dont like michael jackson then go fuck yourself!!! I cant believe you've gone to trouble to search his torrents and write comments get a fucking life you losers!!!! people who appreciate good music want these torrents and dont appreciate sad fucking losers who slag off innocent people. If your sad enough to listen to tabloids who know jack shit and like making money out of other peoples misery and not a high court judge who found michael innocent then you need to look at yourself!!! There are some sad mother fuckers on here who need to get a life!!! Thanks to all the kind people for seeding this torrent and keep up the good work!
,SincereVisionz,2008-09-25T02:10Z,This HAS AND WILL ALWAYS be a great film & great artist. I will be seeding for you
,vigalt,2008-12-19T11:32Z,"The quality is amazing. If you appreciate talent, then watch this.
And yo Demorgan.. MJ is released for no evidence. If you can say anything without evidence, then you are the one who rape children, not him. Atleast leave ur children in the future you motherfucking papa-dicksucker. "
,RubberJohnny,2009-06-26T04:32Z,"RIP Michael, brilliant artist not matter what. "
,krbbagel,2009-06-26T07:51Z,"RIP Michael.  The man knew how to dance and sing like no other.  Loving the memories from Moonwalker.

Even today if he had performed those concerts he would be the King of Pop, there are no contenders."
,Sketchys,2009-06-26T18:28Z,"Rest in Peace our dear friend - thank you Michael for bringing joy to Billions worldwide, you will be sadly missed.

This will forever be seeded now."
,D3LinQuENT,2009-06-27T04:52Z,"One of my most favourite movies.

Rest In Peace Michael May Allah have mercy on your soul!"
,coolguy2008,2009-06-27T06:45Z,"@delinquent. why would god need to have mercy on his soul? did he do something bad? the only BAD thing he did was being fuggin awesome and naming one of his albums ""Bad"" which turned out to be fuggin awesome anyway. Wishing mercy on someone's soul is reserved for murderers and criminals. Michael was not a criminal or maybe he was if you consider being a ""Smooth Criminal"" as being an actual criminal. if so, you're an idiot. RIP Michael Jackson"
,D3LinQuENT,2009-06-27T21:29Z,"@coolguy2008

Nobody of us that leaves this world is sinless, we all make sins and MJ just as any of us had sins, for that reason i said that! I grew up listening to his music and watching his movies and this one Moonwalker was my favourite. 

RIP MJ"
,mattyeire,2009-06-28T00:20Z,jacko was a legend never be forgotton thanks for dis will seed for long time
,mrvain32,2009-06-28T11:54Z,"Thanks for this fine upload 'Hoshisan'. thanks to seeders too.

Many of us makes mistakes and learn from it. MJ's talent and dedication to his music is the only reason why we all love him. Its our fortune that we had a individual who made music sound like it did and looked too, that too in our lifetime. He's the chosen one. We all will forget him soon but his music,sounds and images will live throughout in our lives.
Hope you're not alone anymore."
