Release Notes:

When Swedish musicians Björn Ulvaeus and Benny
Andersson invited their partners Agnetha Fältskog
and Anni-Frid Lyngstad to sing backing vocals on
some tracks, they were quite pleased with the
results, but could not have dreamed how successful
this new direction would be.
After adopting the name ABBA, formed from the
initials of the 4 members' first names, victory in
Brighton in the 1974 Eurovision Song Contest
propelled the band to international stardom. 'Number
Ones' is the latest collection of their hit songs,
which list as favourites to musical luminaries as
varied as Madonna and Scissor Sisters' Jake Shears,
to Bono and Noel Gallagher.
