  RIPPERS NOTES..: Removed Hungarian audio, who needs it anyway? All warning and nag screens removed.
                   We decided to keep all the bonus stuff, because that is we believe the purpose with 
                   an "Extended Explosive Edition" version some how. But just remember this: 
                   Extended scenes have hollow audio and aren't exactly 100% on target.
                   Extended scenes look like a decent telescene, because they aren't 100% digitally remastered.
                   So don't hassle us with this now, blame the DVD Company for not doing a proper job. :P

                   On the original DVD gives you a choice after pressing play, theatrical or extended. If you
                   select extended it will play theatrical vobs till it hits a certain point then play another
                   set of vobs (the extended scene), then it will resume back to the theatrical version. It
                   pauses the movie for a few seconds, but don't worry it will run.
                   Anyway....enjoy. ;)
