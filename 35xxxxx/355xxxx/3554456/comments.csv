,barp,2006-11-09T22:36Z,"Thanks for the upload!!!
any chance of packing the patch only for those who already have the installer?"
,Harls,2006-11-09T22:47Z,"barp

  only the full upgrade supplied"
,BritneysOrifice,2006-11-09T23:35Z,Harls: fantastic addon and SO glad to get the update.  Thanks a lot!
,4X-AXG,2006-11-10T00:03Z,"thanks man, updates are always more than welcome :)"
,BritneysOrifice,2006-11-10T00:11Z,Harls: just a quick question.... Is this a FULL Vancouver+ that's already version 1.1?  Or is it version 1.0 with the patch to 1.1 packaged with it?  Thanks again for any info.
,Harls,2006-11-10T01:01Z,"Britney
Guess it was patched by the author but supplied
as a full version"
,BritneysOrifice,2006-11-10T01:35Z,"Harls: wait a minute... this is a rip, then?"
,Harls,2006-11-10T02:10Z,Britney:   Not necessarily - it is not uncommon for authors to insist on a full version even if patched.
,BritneysOrifice,2006-11-10T03:39Z,"Harls: True, true. I guess the only way to find out is to complete the download. :)  Sure is slow tonight, though."

,BritneysOrifice,2006-11-10T17:21Z,"Harls: well, hate to tell you this buddy, but you uploaded the ****1.0**** version. I have installed it and confirmed that it is the OLD version. The Vancouver+ configurator does not report it's v1.1; and, just to confirm, ALL the file dates on all the installed files are dated 2005 and before.  Sorry, but this is the old version.  :("
,BritneysOrifice,2006-11-10T18:34Z,"Harls: o.k., forget what I wrote above. You have, indeed, uploaded the right version! It was my error as I accidentally re-installed the old version (someone else I read elsewhere had this problem, too!).  THANKS VERY MUCH for this timely upload, Harls.  You da man!"

,Speedbird84,2007-07-13T10:16Z,"Does anyone have the FSX version of the Vancouver+ scenery.

This is one of the best addons "
,cabbagecube,2007-08-29T22:01Z,Awesome work. I would have bought it but charging  40 Euros for a Canadian living in Vancouver is a kick in the face.  This install works.  Cheers
