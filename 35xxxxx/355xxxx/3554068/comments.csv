Thanks."
,jackyshow,2007-01-17T10:56Z,"dontleech, thanks so much for the torrent.

But I have a problem. The German female voice, ie. ulrike.exe is corrupted. Would you please test it in your own computer?

I know how you feel, dontleech, that happens on the torrents I up as well.  So I'm used to the grab - no gratitude mentality.  I DO want to thank you for this (and congrats on your first torrent!) 'cause I was looking for the AT&T Mike voice.

Thanks again!"
,MugiMugi,2007-04-02T21:42Z,"Yep thx for this torrent, always like to try out a voice fully before I decide to buy em and this one will help."
,unmaster,2007-04-23T18:09Z,"GREAT RELEASE!! +++props to dontleech Thanks!!

I've been looking for these a long time. They work perfectly for me.

What would be the extreme-full tilt-headbanging-super jackpot is if you (or someone else) could get their hands on Acapela's voice Erik. It's, hands down, the BEST swedish TTS i've ever heard..! Totally amazing...

Anyone up for it??"
,Ash_Katchem,2007-05-02T10:56Z,"I downloaded this one last year but I had a few problems, for some reason the voices all refused to work after a couple of months. 
Great stuff though."
,jnd,2007-08-02T19:33Z,Thanks! Good TTS packs for a variety of languages isn't easy to find!
,jnd,2007-08-02T21:01Z,"Yeah, hmm, after getting this, I'm not sure what to do either, at least with the Loquendo voices. I run the installer, it installs a few .dll's and things, I patch the .dll. Now, how do I use it?"
,jnd,2007-08-02T21:11Z,"Ohh, I think I know what to do now, and I'm surprised no one else told you, guys/girls. :-)

At least for Loquendo, you need an actual text-to-speech program too! Then you can use the voices with it. One such program is TextAloud.

http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3632963/TextALoud_(PC_Speech_Tool_)

Actually, that torrent comes with a lot of voices too, including Swedish."
,jnd,2007-08-02T21:13Z,"Btw, set the file txtld2237.rar to high priority in your BitTorrent client if it supports that (like ÂľTorrent) and only get that one if you don't need the voices and have already got those. That'll download TextAloud first so you don't need to get the whole 2+ GB in the other torrent."
,electroacoustic,2007-09-02T16:27Z,"TROJAN IN ""_patch.exe""!!!"
,MaximumTaco,2007-09-30T17:42Z,"There are at least two trojan horses in this file, _patch.exe and loquendo_tts_text-to-speech_no-license-key-needed_all-voices-patch_crack_serial_version_6-by_WAR_Hammer.exe.

,wayne329,2007-11-13T02:51Z,"WA, great Thanks. I have been lookinf for it for a long time. I finally found it:)"
,Gnorxy,2007-12-15T02:23Z,"most keygens are recognized as malware, trojans and viruses. if you have it from a real (trusted) source you can be sure, there's no bad code inside! obfuscation and exe/runtime compression - might be used for viruses, but most of the time a common way of decompile protection, positive virus matches due to heuristic.

war hammer dll patcher does not work if %programfiles% isn't located on C:\ drive, copy dll and patcher to C:\some\where\, patch dll and replace original on any other drive.

german female Loquendo voice ""ulrike.exe"" is corrupt :'("
,yngvarystein,2007-12-27T06:31Z,"electroacoustic and MaximumTaco are right. There are reported 2 trojans in these two crack files. Gnorxy I try to run the crack file but I get a message that I don't have permission to run the file. Is this because of AVG internett security which reports problem?
dontleech. nice work now if you please fix these two cracks may how or somebody pleae tell me how to use them?
Thank you"
,juliustil,2008-01-04T20:29Z,"Thanks man, it works just fine....except one thing. Acapela Telecom - voices does't work- it makes application crash, and in the proces list there is this little service running: acapserv.exe or sth like that. How to make those Acapela voices work? pls help ^^"

,skwiez,2008-03-11T04:05Z,"Thanks, this is great! I should mention that the crack for the Loquendo voices isn't a trojan, my Symantec Antivirus says it's safe and I also ran it through Kaspersky's online scanner. It works nicely, although I had to rename the file to a shorter name. I also noticed that the Acapela Telecom voices try to open an internet connection when you use them! My Windows Firewall caught it though, and I blocked it."
,ericIfromIsweden,2008-03-21T00:07Z,Thx for this torrent. works good

,Duckman33,2008-07-13T10:36Z,"Symantec Endpoint Protection keeps detecting Trojan Horse on the _patch.exe and loquendo_tts_text-to-speech_no-license-key-needed_all-voices-patch_crack_serial_version_6-by_WAR_Hammer.exe

Trojan horse is a generic detection so it could be that the files have virus like code on them. Or they could be a true trojan horse virus.

,chaucerchris,2009-02-27T00:14Z,"After discovering the Loquendo website I realised how good Loquendo voices realy were after listening to a demo on the site. But the voices were being used by a program called, TTS Director that allows for some amazing changes of the voices. For example, giving the voices more emotions where they can laugh, cry, cough, sneeze, sound happy and yes even sad. However they don?t truly come into their own when used with any other Text to speech program unless being used by Loquendo?s specially designed program TTs Director. When used with any other TTs program you loose a lot of functionality as stated these voices were designed for TTs Director. You?ll still get good sounding voices but you may find that they don?t work quite as well and at times the other programs using them can freeze up. Loqendo sadly don?t and won?t sell any of thier programs to members of the ordinary public, only to a business or large company. The other voices in this download are good and do work well but leave me very dissapointed after hearing Loquendo voices and only with TTs Director so I am less inclined to use them as they don?t come up to scratch when reading text and sound very flat in parts.
