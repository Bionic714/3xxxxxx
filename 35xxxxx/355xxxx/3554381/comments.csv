Having said that, I used the keygen quickly before letting AVG delete it. It worked and unlocked the software which now runs nicely and does its job very well indeed. And the virus was disposed of quickly and easily by AVG, leaving me with a nice CD converter and no viruses.

Just saying, be careful."
