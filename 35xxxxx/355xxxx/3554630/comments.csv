,ta84,2006-11-10T03:33Z,"I re-uploaded this torrent because I got the impression that the last one wasn't seeding at all.

Anyway, I recommend watching ""Relentless"" first and then ""Obsession"" right after that. Together, its only about two and a half hours and it keeps you watching the whole time! What I'm trying to say is its not ""long,"" and you become most educated and aware of how real the Islamofacist threat is today; it threatens Western society as we know it! 

I'd also like to add that I ripped these off the actual dvd's so they're good quality rips. Better than the low quality, unofficial, ""Obsession"" found on other torrents. Though this is the ""pre-release"" of ""Obsession,"" its only 15 minutes shorter than the low quality unofficial copy found elsewhere. Its also, in my opinion, put together better than the unofficial version. 

So download this, seed it, burn it, and distribute it to everyone you know! It's imperative that America wakes up and pressures their politicians to recognize and acknowledge this threat for what it is! Rick Santorum sees it most clearly of all politicians, and he got voted out last election. Its imperative to our very existence that we do not let this happen again and, for that matter, pressure more politicians to be more like Santorum. Thanks for downloading and getting this out."

,bl00dcl0t,2006-11-17T01:48Z,Dont bother not very objective.
,blaz3r,2006-11-18T22:34Z,"this guy clearly is a hate mongering dick. 

if he can lie to you and say this movie is objective while obviously he himself isn't then why should we trust and believe in anything else he says?

bottom line: ta84 is a liar."
,oboelcke,2006-11-22T02:09Z,"Take it from someone who has done 2 tours in the ME these movies barely touch on the institutionalized hatred of these Islamofacist whackos. The hatred some of these mullahs preach is striaght from rhetoric of Adolf Hitler. These movies are maybe abit to objective and they definately don't show the worst these people preach.
Most people in the ME are not like the far fringe whackos, but are peace loving good people. It is unfortunate that they have to live in fear from these psuedo brown-shirt thugs and murderers.
I do recommend everyone watch these clips though as they may get some idea what a threat the free world really faces."
