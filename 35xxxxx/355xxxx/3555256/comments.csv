vid has great riding but was put together poorly. bad music, doen't announce the rider, and riders talkin not in english"
,phosss,2006-11-28T04:50Z,"Beautiful film,

A refreshing change from the norm. This doesn't follow the standard snowboard film formula, there are no twits making stupid faces into the camera, no lame pop soundtrack, no product placement and no blatant idolization of riders. This isn't about worshiping world famous riders and by extension they're gear, but about worshiping riding - absolutely beautiful. A true celebration of snowboarding.

to recap:

Cinematography is top notch,
Soundtrack is AMAZING,
Riding is inspiring,
The terrain will make you cry."
