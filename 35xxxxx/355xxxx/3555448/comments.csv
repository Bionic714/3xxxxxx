,shakewell,2006-11-12T16:26Z,Why do people from the United Kingdom have such a big problem with wankers?...
,Globalhousepricecrash,2006-11-13T14:01Z,"People who masturbate ?
Is that a big problem , I don't follow ."
,Globalhousepricecrash,2006-11-13T14:17Z,Could be you are either referring to the disclaimer (which I think is the right thing to do as the owner of the site may not want to be linked with torrents) or the house price crash theme . If it's the latter then you obviously don't want to be informed of the possibility of people losing vast amounts of money on housing (as some are already doing) . That's your choice . But why the attempted insult ? Strange person .
