,killalltheyuppies,2006-11-05T22:00Z,"Sorry I was so late on this one.  I try to do them on Friday, I was just very busy this weekend.
Enjoy"
,amceagle,2006-11-05T22:25Z,"Awesome, thanks!"
,joakie,2006-11-07T02:36Z,"any idea why the sound would be sped way up when i play this? i have the latest divx codecs....but yeah, this is unwatchable as it is right now, hopefully it's something wrong on my end. help?"
,killalltheyuppies,2006-11-09T23:58Z,"sounds like a prob on your end.
Nobody else has had a prob.
Try the K-lite codec pack?

CODECS USED:
VIDEO : Divx 6.2.0.8 4cc: Divx
AUDIO : MP3 - l3codecx.ax"
,rotherhamat,2006-11-10T13:14Z,"I have the same problem as joakie.

Tried installing the k-lte codec pack, but it didnt solve anything. Any ideas?"
,killalltheyuppies,2006-11-12T12:24Z,media player classic is always better than media player.  You can try that.  try installing the Divx 6.2 or 6.4 codec.
,amceagle,2006-11-12T19:56Z,Same audio problem for me
,killalltheyuppies,2006-11-13T00:42Z,"It's been DL'd 1111 - times, so it's a prob on the codec end of YOUR pc.  I suggest removing codecs and reinstalling.  Make sure you have a divx codec for divx 6.2 or up as this file was made with divx 6.2"
,amceagle,2006-11-13T16:37Z,Is that the same codec you used for the other ones? I've been able to those no problem.
,killalltheyuppies,2006-11-14T23:50Z,"nope this and the last one... Hand banana were the same though.     Im going back to the codecs that worked for everybody from now on though.   Stick to good old XVID PCM, and everybody will be happy.
I'm curious why it isn't working for some peeps.  Oh well, Ill just go back to the 150 + MB instead of the 75 - "
,gxgflame,2006-11-19T21:32Z,I've got the same audio problem. :'(
,armanix,2006-12-05T06:41Z,"I just viewed it and have the same problems when using BS Player, but with VLC it doesnt speed up the sound.  However, the frames does freeze when I forward it.  In general there's some big issues with this codec, I did not have any problems viewing the other episodes such as handbanana, with BS Player (ie no audio issues).  I will probably have to get this from adult swim fix myself and get it working because it's unviewable for me at the moment..."
