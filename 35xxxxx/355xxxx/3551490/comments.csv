,Soulpilot,2006-11-07T00:49Z,"What exactly is the process for mounting the installed .dmg file through toast titanium?? 
Sorry, justa newb."
,gazzer82,2006-11-07T19:13Z,"1 - Open Toast
2 - Go to the copy tab
3 - Click the little blue arrow to the right of the ""Image File"" text to expand the left side panel and choose image file.
4 - In the main window choose open and select the dmg file and open it.
5 - Toast will now mount the file and it will shoe up in finder as a cd rom.
6 - Install and enjoy!!

And probs let me know!!

Cheers

The 5.1 updater didn't work. The activation asks for the disk to be in the drive... Any suggestions?"

,mspider,2006-11-09T07:53Z,"I couldnt get the Activation Code to work. Is there a specific name that goes with it.
I used:  DP500-010D8-JV040A

just returns for a re-enter.
??????"
,gazzer82,2006-11-09T20:03Z,"To all people who are having issues, firstly please ensure that you read the readme, secondly make sure you have the image mounted in toast, NOT FINDER!!!!!! when you try to activate/install the update.

Any further probs then try another activation number (i.e from serial box or something), but really there is no reason it shouldn't work and not there is no name to enter, use whtever you like.

Cheers

,mspider,2006-11-10T01:21Z,"Hey gazzer,
thanks for the response.

I did mount in Toast on a MacBook Pro
Used your Activ No.  Serial Box had the same          
Activ No as yours.  Doesnt seem like i could be doing anything wrong.
But I cant get it to work. SUCKS, i wanted this.
I guess i'll keep looking for other Activ #s."
,mspider,2006-11-10T02:17Z,"OK, this is crazy. Version 5 ran with the Acticivation Code, although I did the exact same thing. Oh well, it works.

Of course now, i have the same problem with the 5.1 update. Activ code wont take.
Geeez.
thanks gazzer"

,voodoobutter,2007-07-02T19:33Z,"Gazzer, you rock. Great dl. For all who are still having problems, you must use Toast. Tried creating install discs with no luck. Keep the DP5.dmg mounted while you're installing the update and everything should take. Works like a charm on my MBP dual 2.0. Thanks again"
,desire_armed,2007-09-14T05:59Z,"Hey All,

For everyone having issues with authorizing DP AFTER you have installed the update, this is for you.  

In the readme, step 6 ""Unmount the Image"" is the wrong instruction.  DO NOT unmount the 5.0 image before installing the update.  Install the update with the image mounted, run DP 5.1 and authorization should run smoothly.

If that gives you issues, unmount the 5.0 image, install the 5.1 update, REMOUNT the 5.0 image, and then run the updated version.  The authorization ought to work this way as well."
,mindmuzack,2007-09-17T01:24Z,Can someone seed DP 4.5 please.
,mindmuzack,2007-09-21T18:43Z,"When I try to burn the file in toast it gives me a message saying:
""Toast could not detect the format of ""MOTU Digital performer 5.1(Univeral Binary).dmg Click Continue if you are certain that it is a valid disc image.""

Why does Toast 8 think its an audio file?"

,ComfortableInClouds,2008-02-17T22:39Z,"Awesome. Works great.

BUT!

Need a manual! This program is a beast. There's no way you could mess around on this program till  you ""figure it out."" I've used multiple sequencers and digital audio programs (mostly reason and ableton, but also max/msp and sibelius), and I can't even get my midi keyboard to play on a track :-(

I would love for someone to post a PDF of the manual, but it looks like if you d/l this torrent, you'll have to purchase the manual. So essentially you pay $30 for an $800 program. Not bad."
,abeliangroups,2008-03-08T09:45Z,"OK, figured out the problem where it just keeps prompting for the key over and over...

The deal is that DP writes a key file to the root folder of the harddrive it is installed on. My problem was that the hard drive is owned by 'root' and is read-only for the admin group. I fixed the problem by:

1) right click on harddrive icon in finder and choose 'Get Info'

2) expand the ownership and permissions details

3) click on the little lock and type admin password

4) set the owner to be my user: THIS MUST BE THE SYSTEM ADMIN USER - or else maybe the OS won't work any more

5) set owner access to read/write

6) set group to 'admin'

7) set group access to read/write

After this I was able to follow the directions to install and register DP."

,mac4music,2008-03-23T03:44Z,"I'm trying to do this process. I have the .dmg on a disc that I mount via toast titanium 7. the instal goes just fine until I get to the key portion. If I leave the image mounted while I type the activation code it basically freezes with 'application not responding' in the pop up menu from the dock. If I unmount the image it asks for a reenter of the code repeatedly.

Should I try to open dp5 before installing the 5.1 update? I have yet to try mounting the disc image, installing dp5, unmounting the image, installing the updater, then remounting the image and trying to enter the activation code.

any other thoughts would be appreciated greatly!"
,mac4music,2008-03-23T08:58Z,"correction: I figured it out, I just wasn't waiting long enough and thought the computer froze.

Firstly, make sure you go back into the MOTU DP5 Folder in applications and are running DP5.1!!
not 5.0

then have your disk image still mounted in Toast
(if you need help with that look at other posts here)

Then, just enter in the serial DP500-010D8-JV04A (comes in the README file of your DP (universal Binary) folder

and it should run fine!

enjoy!!
