7 albums of The Great Kat (Violin Virtuoso & Guitar Shredder Goddess)"
,Raas,2006-11-17T13:10Z,"Thanks,awesome stuff!
Also checked out her website.
I remember reading about her in a guitar mag
back in late 80's early 90's something."
,ElgerHz,2006-11-19T23:18Z,"You're welcome ""Raas"" :-)

For those who are interested, there is a music video for the song ""Torture Chamber"" on youtube: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJbTtfEChUM

Cool video although it isn't among her best songs.

On a personal note I must say that little did I know that so many would be interested in this torrent, 111 persons have downloaded it at the time of writing this. Perhaps I should upload some more stuff, I got a LOT of metal from the 80's & 90's in mp3 format. But what to choose is the big question :-)

Finally I would like to mention to those downloading this torrent: Remember to seed for a while after it is downloaded! I'll keep on seeding for at least a week from now on."

When I find them I will upload in FLAC. Also have Beethoven on Speed on cassette. Even though your sound quality is shit, I appreciate the upload irregardless. I PROMISE to SEED back @ least 5 times what I get!!! AWESOME torrent, THANKS ""ElgerHz"" and may both Satan & God bless the HELL outta you!!!  BTW, I met her in '87 or '88 @ a show in the Richmond,VA area(She smacked my face & in less than 60 seconds gave me an enormous hickey on the right side of my neck) My mother was SO pissed off when I got home!!!!!!! I was maybe Love, DrScott"
