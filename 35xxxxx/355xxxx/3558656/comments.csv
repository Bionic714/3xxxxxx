Just some month ago I encounted remixed music tracks on c64remix (commodore64 remix) with these Max Headroom. Now I have watched some crappy quality clips on youtube and yeah.. No wonder why these character did become some (in)famous. Very special.

Anyway, thanks for this, I will surrely check this out."
