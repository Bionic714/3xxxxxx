,kokoloupo,2006-11-17T13:08Z,"FLAC stands for Free Lossless Audio Codec. Contrary to MP3 and ogg Vorbis is lossless. No audio data is filtered or supressed during encoding.  And is not patented as is MP3. In fact mp3 should be boycoted. Here you can download for decoding http://flac.sourceforge.net/
 or try to install K-Lite codec pack here http://www.codecguide.com/download_mega.htm"
