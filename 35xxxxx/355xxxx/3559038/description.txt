A set of video tutorials for 3D Studio Max 8. I will seed this whenever possible, please be patient. (I\'ll seed this all day on the weekends.)

To view the videos, just simply extract the file from the archives, then mount the ISO using Daemon-tools or similar program. The Iso file does not autorun, you have to manually navigate to the videos.
