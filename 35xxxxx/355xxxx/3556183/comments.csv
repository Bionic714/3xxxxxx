,gigante1,2006-11-12T23:26Z,"I got the save-game menu to work ! I deleted most of the savegames via another dash.
Perhaps it was to many for this one, or one of them not workeing?

But doues anyone know how to map the memorycard in the savegame-menu, I can only copy to E: or F:\backup\UDATA, and I can not find out where to change the source for this?
In the original MS dash it chooses the memcard by default. "

,GasGiver4711,2006-11-13T20:26Z,"@All : The last entry in the official XBMC Changelog makes this Release the ----- 2.0.1 ----- Point release. Nothing was changed, just the entry ----- 2.0.1 ----- was added to the changelog."
,linjalmannen,2006-11-15T20:37Z,"Why is streaming video so slow on newer releases ?? I have streamed video many years with ccxgui without problems , but newer xmbc takes several minutes to start the movie.. Anyone??"
,Mange99,2006-11-19T00:43Z,"I have a problem, if a have a DTS record (music) on the hdd or network it plays as 5.1
And the reader can?t find it. I want DTS sound.
It works perfect whit DVD movies.
I had a DVD player before, and it work, but now it?s broken, So I need it on the Xbox
Thanks for an almost perfect media enter!"
,iksvo,2007-01-05T19:36Z,Linjalmannen: It's probably because you use your bandwidth to the fullest. The file can't be streamed as it should can when your disks are writing/dl and reading/ul very fast. Or it's just a big ass file. Or it's just a crap ass release.
,PIMPIT!,2007-01-13T23:17Z,How do i install this on my xbox?
