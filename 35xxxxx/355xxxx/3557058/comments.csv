'cause your dvd player probably doesn't support the divx/xvid codec. go and get you a new dvd player or look out for a firmware upgrade.

'cause dvd shrink doesn't know how to handle these *.avi files, I suppose

even if this _was_ a dvdrip I wouldn't even _think_ of distributing *.rar files.
I don't think there's any need of compressing 2 gigabyte just to decompress the shit after download again."
