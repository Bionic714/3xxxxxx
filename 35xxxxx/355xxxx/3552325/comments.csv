,Churchills Dog,2006-11-12T12:34Z,"The shitty quality gives it an almost home movie like feel that sort of adds to the whole thing. Unfortunately the guy who filmed it never bothered to center the camera so all the subtitled dialogue throughout the movie between Borat and his producer is cut off on the bottom of the screen.

It IS watchable but your better off looking for another version."
