Gnomes? Hobbits? No way, man--defective airplanes is where it\'s at! The debut solo album of Hawkwind vocalist/poet Robert Calvert finds as its inspiration the apparently true story of Germany\'s purchase of the Lockheed Starfighter jet. Due to the modifications made in Germany\'s appropriation of the jet (the \"F104G\") that proved to be fatal, the Starfighter later achieved the dubious monikers \"The Flying Coffin\" and \"The Widowmaker.\"

Captain Lockheed alternates between octane guzzlers in the classic Hawkwind vein and Monty Python-like vignettes that move the story along. For the songs, since all the key members of classic Hawkwind are actually on here (though Dave Brock is only present on one song), this is a veritable Hawkwind album in all but name, with strongest moments including \"The Right Stuff\" and \"The Aerospaceage Inferno.\" Brian Eno also is on board, and as Paul Rudolph and Simon King were with him to record his debut solo album, folks will notice an obvious resemblance in sound to Here Come the Warm Jets.

At their best, the vignettes are deliciously dark in their surrealism (\"Ground Control to Pilot\" would have made a classic interlude on Space Ritual) and humor (\"Interview\"). In the center of it all is Calvert, turning out a manic characterization of the Ãœber-Teutonic Defense Minister with a crazed German accent that might make even Keith Moon slink away.

Since this album is so laced with the British humor typified by Python that peaked in the early-mid 1970s, it probably won\'t tickle everyone\'s funny bone. In my ideal world, however, an album with such a bizarre idea as its concept gets points just on principle.
