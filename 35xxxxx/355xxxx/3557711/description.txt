General
-  All players will have talent points reimbursed and will have access
   to new talents throughout their trees; this includes the 41-point 
   talents. Several new abilities have also been added for all classes.
-  All pets now receive a percentage of their master\\\'s armor, spell 
   damage, spell resistances, attack power, and stamina.
-  Low-level spells cast by high-level players will receive smaller 
   bonuses from +healing and +spell damage.
-  HoTs, DoTs, and channeled spells have been re balanced to receive a 
   more appropriate (higher) percentage of +spell damage and +healing.
-  HoTs from different sources will now stack (i.e. multiple druids can
   cast the Rejuvenation spell on 1 target).
-  New item property \\\"Resilience\\\" has been introduced. Resilience 
   reduces your chance to be the victim of a critical strike, and 
   reduces the amount of damage critical strikes do to you.
-  Weapon Skill now does the following:
-  Weapon skill will no longer reduce the percentage damage lost due to
   glancing.
-  The player will gain 0.1% to their critical strike rating per weapon
   skill against monsters above their level.
-  When casting a buff on a low level target, the appropriate rank of 
   the buff will be automatically be applied.
-  Crowd Control effects in PvP will last no longer than 12 seconds 
   instead of the full duration, with a chance of a heartbeat resist.
-  Players will no longer lose faction when under the influence of 
   \\\"Mind Control\\\" or the Gnomish Mind Control Cap.

PvP
-  Honor System Revamp
   Current honor totals have been reset.
   Players may display their highest lifetime rank title (accessible 
   from character sheet).
   Honor points earned each day may now be spent as a form of currency.
   Check the PvP tab of your character sheet to see your honor 
   information.
   PvP rewards are no longer unique.
-  Marks of Honor earned from battlegrounds are no longer turned in for
   reputation or honor.  They are now used in addition to honor points 
   in order to purchase rewards.
-  Two New Arenas are now available in three different modes.
   2v2, 3v3, and 5v5 matches
   Players may queue up at Goblin NPC\\\'s in Stormwind, Ironforge, 
   Orgrimmar, Undercity, and Gadgetzan

Druids
-  The talent \\\"Swiftmend\\\" will now include bonus healing from the 
   talents \\\"Improved Rejuvenation\\\" and \\\"Empowered Rejuvenation\\\".

Hunters
-  Traps can be set while in combat, but require a 2 second arming time.
-  Auto shot will be automatically enabled if the Hunter steps out of 
   melee range while in combat with target.
-  1 agility will now grant 1 ranged attack power.
-  Auto shot is now reset when casting Aimed Shot.

Shaman
-  Shaman with the appropriate talent spec are now able to dual-wield. 
   Both main and off-hand weapons can be affected by self-weapon buffs 
   such as Windfury.
-  Rockbiter\\\'s weapon functionality has been changed. It is now a 
   damage proc instead of a flat attack power bonus.
-  Windfury Weapon and Rockbiter Weapon enchantments will only benefit
   the weapon with the enchantment on it.

Warlocks
- Range of \\\"Drain Life\\\" and \\\"Drain Mana\\\" spells have been increased.

Warriors
-  Rage generation from dealing damage has been normalized.
-  All Rage awards are averaged with our expected rage per swing 
   (adjusted for weapon speed).

Items
-  The \\\"Far Sight\\\" effect has changed so that the camera now zooms in
   to a distant location, rather than instantly showing the distant 
   view. This also affects the items: Ultra-Spectropic Vision Goggles, 
   the Ornate Spyglass, and the Hunter ability \\\"Eagle Eye.\\\"
-  Spells can now require either a totem item or a totem category item 
   to cast a spell. This means that the Enchanting Rods now count as 
   all of the lower level enchanting rods as well, so you only need a 
   single enchanting rod instead of all six. This also means that 
   \\\"Finkel\\\'s Skinner\\\" now counts as a Skinning Knife. Several weapons 
   that are picks have been flagged as counting as a Mining pick as 
   well.
-  Items that give bonuses, such as + to crit, have been modified to 
   adhere to a combat rating system.
-  All current items will provide the exact same benefit from ratings 
   at level 60 as they provided before the ratings system.
-  Thrown weapon items no longer stack, but use durability instead. One
   unit of durability is lost per throw, and these items can be repaired.
-  The tool tip for the Great Staff of the Guardian now shows the 
   proper increase of 28 to the party spell critical rating.
-  Items that are useable from player inventory with a cooldown will 
   now update the cooldown in real-time.

   vendors.

   break the Rogue ability \\\"Gouge\\\".
-  The \\\"Skull of Impending Doom\\\" has been changed and will now increase
   run speed by 60% for 10 seconds, but deals damage equal to 60% of 
   your maximum health and drains 60% of your maximum mana for over 10 
   seconds.
-  The Backfire effect on the \\\"Net-O-Matic\\\" will no longer break on 
   damage.

Professions
-  All of the profession-made items that have been created up to now 
   have been given proper stats based on the current expansion item 
   level progression table.
-  Most of the items made by Tailoring/Leatherworking/Blacksmithing 
   have had their creation time reduced. Now the cap on time required 
   to make an item in those professions is based on quality and level.
-  New Max times required.
   Level 31+ Green Items at least 8 sec
   Level 31+ Blue Items at least 15 sec
   Level 31+ Purple Items at least 25 sec 
   Skill level now determines what items you can disenchant.
   Skill 1= Level 1-20
   Skill  25= Level 20-25
   Skill  50= Level 25-30

   on a boat when the loading screen appears.
