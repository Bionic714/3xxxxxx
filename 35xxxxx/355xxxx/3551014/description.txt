Eidos Interactive\\\'s action/strategy title Abomination feeds on ominous visions of apocalyptic hell - plagues sweeping the Earth, unbridled chaos as millions die and thousands more suffer as they are left to fend for themselves in a world now devoid of law and order. From among these survivors rises The Faithful, a growing band of zealots who have embraced the plague and chant liturgies in praise of The Brood. You and your team of eight genetically altered, super marines are given orders to stop The Faithful and their agenda before their influence spreads. As a player you control this team, plus a ragtag assortment of plague survivors, four at a time entering into the depths of a biological nightmare world. As you go about your mission, you must gather intelligence, obtain technology and discover new weapons. You must be the one to free humanity of the Abomination.
