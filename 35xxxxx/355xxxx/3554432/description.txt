This gave me an idea to do some tinkering and I have. 

6 MLS teams are now in the Barclay\'s Premiership. (D.C. United, F.C. Dallas, New England, Houston, Chivas and Chicago). 6 English teams are now in the MLS.  I took the 3 promoted teams and the 15th 16th 17th teams in the EPL from last season. So, MLS fans, say hello to Reading, Watford, Sheff Utd, Aston Villa, Man City and Portsmouth.

Now I know what you\'re thinking. Hey that\'s not fair. The US teams are broke! I fixed that, not by sugar daddying them but by giving them enough $$$ to get a good wage budget going and to sign some players. Let\'s see what happens. :D Enjoy!
