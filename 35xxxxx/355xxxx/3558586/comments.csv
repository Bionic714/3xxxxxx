,Tsundere,2008-04-25T23:24Z,"Great film and good quality audio/video. Thanks IggyPop for your other uploads too, your upload list reads like a best film list. 

The only thing I find lacking in quality is the subbing,  and not just in this torrent but many others (particularly Kurosawa's movies). It seems that half of the dialogue is either translated poorly or not translated at all, and it is very obvious even with languages you don't speak. "
