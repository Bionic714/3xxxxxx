HERE IS THE GUIDE!

Requrirment : Daemon tools
ePSXe ( Dont know if the version counts. But i got 1.1.v

Download Daemon tools at : http://forum.daemon-tools.cc/download.php?mode=ViewCategory&catid=5

Install Daemon tools.

Now to the game! UNRAR/UNZIP the game, and place it in the map you have games. or any other maps, but you gotta know where you got it.
Press on Daemon tools. down in the right corner. ( CLOCK ) an then press on the FIRST pop up. Now you will have to FIND the RAYMAN.ccd . Easie peasie. Just go to where you have a the extracted the Rayman. and there you have it.(USE DAEMON TO LOCATION.)

Now open your ePSXe. Config and then CD room. But be4 doing this, you gotta know what driver you put the Rayman in. ( DAEMON TOOLS.)
Just click on the same daemon mark down to the right corner. and then look at it. It should look somthing like this Enhet 0: [F:] - blablabla

THe "" F "" is the driver it uses. So NOW open the ePSXe and choose the Config - CD room - Configure - Select CD rom letter. Change it to the letter you have in the daemon tools. 

Now the last thing. SAVE, and then press FILE - RUN CDROM

And there it plays. ITS A LIL SLOW AT THE BEGINING. SO it may look like its bugged, But just stay pation. 

Thanks!"

,TheScorpionKing131,2012-03-08T19:11Z,"Nice, downloading now.
Thanx in the name of nostalgia :D"
,Donslayer,2012-06-18T18:48Z,"[QUOTE]so that noob,what posted here you have to download Deamon tools is stupid[QUOTE]

Well, THIS noob uses Daemon tools to have SOUND working in the game, without it the sound wont work, so to everyone that has the sound bug, just run the game trough daemon tools -> PsX Emu. Have a nice day."
