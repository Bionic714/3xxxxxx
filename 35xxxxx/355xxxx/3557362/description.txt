Last change to the rest of text: 2006-10-28

Check the date above, if not changed, don't read 
the rest because it was not changed since the last time.

Please, seed 1:1 or max. 72hrs because I can't do that 
alone. Someone else let you have the file, so just give
back.

You can upload the .TORRENT on other publics/privates tracker
More trackers = more seeders/leechers = more speed overall :D
I don't know all of them ;) But keep all the files and 
use the .TXT for description.


Thank's

NEW: INFO 2 MIS v2.0.0B4 is out!!!! 2006-10-11

What's new:  Create a .MIS from IMDB within Windows Explorer 
and a few other things. I got a small video taken from
the M.I.S. site (249KB) that show you how. It could not 
be more easier than that now!

******************************************************
If you download a free file anywhere(database/software)
remember to click on the ads. They do appreciated it. 
It pays for the bandwidth/site! :D

******************************************************
So, what is a .MIS(my own definition)? 

A .MIS is a metadata text file(title, description, 
credit, goofs, chapters...) file formatted to help 
in the organization of all the movies/tv shows/podcast ...
you got in folders. It replace the .NFO.

It's formated so that players (software and consumer 
electronics) can use that information(metadata) and
display it on the screen.

The .TXT was made from the .MIS text file as the source. 
I only created it to post on sites. Otherwise, I don't 
use it.

******************************************************

INFO 2 MIS v2.0.0B4 is free. It's the app's that I 
used to create the .MIS. It can also extract
information from imdb.com(with picture), tv.com, 
amazon.com(with picture), dvdempire.com (with picture) ....

Took me a second with an episode on tv.com and
a few more for a movies on imdb.com

******************************************************
VideoRedo(not free) is the best for editing MPEG files.
It's fast and easy and worth the money. I can remove
commercials or cut an MPG2 with ease. :D
