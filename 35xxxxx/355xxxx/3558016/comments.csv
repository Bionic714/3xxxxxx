,BritneysOrifice,2006-11-15T16:36Z,"Jackio: hey... looks good.  Quick question, though: is this thing cracked?  Or is this the original wrapper, uncracked?"
,Jackio,2006-11-15T17:10Z,"Its just an installer. Double click, install and it works fine."
,4X-AXG,2006-11-16T12:08Z,"thanks Jackio, but can anyone confirm this works?"
,Jackio,2006-11-16T13:27Z,I can. It works.
,4X-AXG,2006-11-16T15:18Z,"lol okay well let me rephrase

thanks Jackio, but can anyone else besides Jacki confirm this works?"
,flightmax,2006-11-20T09:52Z,"A heard a rumor FS2Crew is using a new license system different from the old one.  The program will appear to work at first, but after so many uses it will launch some kind of virus or trojan that will fuck your system.

So be careful boys..."
,Jackio,2006-11-20T15:04Z,"Uhm, Wouldnt that make the fs2crew team hacker and should them selfs be put in jail?"
,flightmax,2006-11-20T18:53Z,"jackio, it's just a rumor i heard...

they're using some new system that can't be detected by a virus/trojan scan.  so if you're running a pirate copy, it will work for awhile but then you get fucked.  sorry to be the bearer of bad news... "

,duffman7575,2006-12-20T05:51Z,So does anyone know if there is any truth to the virus/trojan thing? Would like to know before I install.
,Jackio,2006-12-20T17:58Z,"There is no truth in that.  Sent an e-mail to the fs2crew team and asked (since Im one of those who buy thire products) and asked. Its not true, so dont be worried."

,Spitfire7,2008-04-01T12:33Z,Hey so what is the difference from fs2crew compared to the PMDG 747 Queen of the sky v2.?  Do I even need this fs2crew?
,Jackio,2008-04-19T11:53Z,"This is no standalone aircraft, but an add-on to the default 747. It adds a simulated crew that you can boss around. Hence, BIG difference from the stand alone aircraft by PMDG"
