Tune in to CHMR(93.5 fm) Sundays from 10-1am for Apocalyptic Raids. Three hours of Crust, Grind, Power Violence, Thrash, H/C, Black Metal, NWOBHM, Crossover, Folk, and Punk Rock

This week I\'ll be playing:

L-Seven-Early 80\'s Post-Punkers, not the Grunge band
Jesus Fucking Christ-80\'s style dark H/C featuring Dave Edwardson from Neurosis
Laughing Hyenas-Detroit Blues Punkers

I\'ll also be playing The self titled 7\" from Minneapolis band \"Final Conflict\".
Raging H/C, not to be confused with the californian band with the same
name.
And the full length debut album from Gorilla Angreb(though it\'s only slightly longer than a 7\"). Awesome female fronted European Punk Rock.
