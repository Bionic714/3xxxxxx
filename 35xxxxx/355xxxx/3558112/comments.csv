""Jag har bara 0,4 Mbit/s upp, så när ni (äntligen) får ner den, så hjälp gärna till att seeda lite.""

Which means...
""I've only got 0,4 Mbit/s in uploadspeed, so when you (at last) got it downloaded, so please help to seed a liiiiitle bit..."""

,martinthepirate04,2008-06-25T14:11Z,"requirements
pentium 133
windows 95 

issues only aplies to NT XP an Vista 

becuse these system are builr differently fom windows 98 the game migh not work well should this occur download dosbox http://www.dosbox.com/
this english instructions first go to your downloads there you will find the a folder named microsoft flight simulator then unpack with winrar this takes a long time so get a soda and run and run ps the archives in german just select installeran and fisrt runnin ist likely you will be asked for the serial dont cry becuse it has been uploaded
