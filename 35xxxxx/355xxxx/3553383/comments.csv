Does this work, cause I didnt know the .ace file compression was that good o.O"
,piratailin,2008-03-11T10:11Z,"ace compression is crap. The freeware version has adware built in. winrar and winzip won't decompress this. I don't know about 7zip, but somehow I doubt it."
,DKnight2066,2008-06-01T02:39Z,"I've stuck with Winace for it's superior compression for over 5 years. I've never had any issues with using it's "".ace"" format for all my compression needs.

However, I must agree that the freeware version of Winace now includes Adware. I downloaded a new Keygen for Winace to get around that, which is something most everyone that uses this site should be capable of doing.   :-)

I've always considered it a small price for superior compression and faster downloads. 

Lastly, yes, if you try and decompress a "".ace"" archive with anything but Winace, it will tell you the archive is corrupt. "
