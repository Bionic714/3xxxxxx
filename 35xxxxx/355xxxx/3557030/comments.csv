im using a  psx 1.13, not espsx.

when i inserted the cd image, it takes me to a menu which lets me choose between crash, 1, 2, 3, and spyro the dragon

so far it has worked great :)

thank you"
,alex73191,2008-07-26T07:12Z,"with psx 1.13, you dont have to burn a cd, you just save the image in a folder, and when you want to play it, just open it using the psx.
