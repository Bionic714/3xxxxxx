"
,mr_fong,2007-05-23T06:08Z,"7z files are similar to .zip  
just extract the files using winrar. "
,hXcpat,2007-07-09T02:48Z,Can someone seed please?
,Late123asdXXX,2007-12-06T15:00Z,"nice torrent!

,Mirzab14,2007-12-09T20:51Z,"YES! Thanks a lot! I've been looking for these so I can play them on my PSP.

Ill be seeding this."
,MLippen,2008-03-28T15:11Z,I need to know what to do to have the torrent DL start
,VileCore,2008-06-12T10:50Z,"I'd recommend not using Doomsday and instead using Skulltag. Skulltag is what Doom is all about. Capture the Flag, four new weapons and an active-game browser? 
www.skulltag.com"
,VictorDTarsus,2008-07-25T05:50Z,7z archives sometimes are crap though. I'll see if they work on my system though.
,GubbenIGruvan,2008-07-27T23:54Z,i like this torrent. i'm gonna seed it for a looooong time.
,RougeNetNavi,2008-11-18T02:38Z,Oh booyah! My collection of IWADs is complete!
,_biker_,2009-02-26T22:29Z,so this is not the actual game?
,corpus_callosum,2009-05-13T21:42Z,"Thanks, man."
,adamstru,2009-06-14T08:54Z,"Thanks! By the way, are the Doom WADs the latest versions?"
,lernatix,2009-10-19T10:48Z,"I keep getting time-outs, is PB broken today?"
,nineinchnail6794,2010-02-23T03:36Z,whats up with all you newbs and winrar? use 7-zip... its so much better...
,MwMike,2010-03-19T21:04Z,"I'm seriously hoping that this HexDD.WAD is the most recent version. For years I've had the original 1.0 version, but I'm helping someone compile a full DooM wad collection and seeing as I found my version was old I've since been hunting down version 1.1. Finding it is much harder than I would have expected, I can find every other WAD in no more than twenty seconds of searching. "
,doolykim,2010-05-07T13:48Z,"Looking for the latest WAD for Hexen: Deathkings of the Dark Citadel? Look no elsewhere but here at WWW dot MEGA_UPLOAD dot COM/?d=GVTUAE40 (remove _ )

Old one is problematic for playing background music. I converted it usng Raven's official patch in DOS environment (DOSBOX)."
,Knukkohead,2012-04-21T10:24Z,fanfuckingtastic! thanks!
,Sergeant_Mark_IV,2012-04-27T19:56Z,"All wads are working fine, and works in Multiplayer with Skulltag too. I will seed this forever.

PS: Don't use Doomsday, it sucks. Download Skulltag to play it online in a client-server achiteture which supports almost every mod."
,rocket221,2012-05-19T21:08Z,"Works great with zdoom on linux.
These are the game files only so you will need a doom engine to run them."
,Nakanaki,2012-05-24T13:07Z,Its working?
,staggy,2012-07-29T05:36Z,"Great download. Thank you very much!

@Sergeant_Mark_IV: Hello."
