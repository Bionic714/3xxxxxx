Famous Five On A Secret Trail Tape Play
by Enid Blyton]


Camping again! This time the gang of Five have pitched their tent near an old ruined cottage - which looks as though it\\\'s been abandoned for years! When Anne hears strange noises at night - coming from the cottage - the others don\\\'t believe her... Until they see the ghostly lights. All of a sudden camping doesn\\\'t seem like quite such a good idea. Is the cottage really haunted, or is there another, just as sinister, explanation?
