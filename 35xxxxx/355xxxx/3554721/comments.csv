[V],Ludor,2006-12-20T01:01Z,This is a lovely game.
,sanoi,2006-12-24T00:06Z,"Kholdstare: It is a simple game where you use the spacebar to jump with a guy riding a unicycle, the point is to avoid holes in the ground by jumping."

,Chrille_22,2008-01-09T18:49Z,"no it dosn´t, it´s os 9 only, not osx. I don´t think leopard have classic mode either so you can play it that way.."
