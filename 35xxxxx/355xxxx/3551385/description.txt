Release Notes:

The other one got nuked... here's the proper! :)

The eagerly anticipated second album from Irish
singer-songwriter Damien Rice, '9' demonstrates the
vast and diverse creative talent of Rice, who wrote,
recorded and produced the record, as well as
designing its artwork. The album is the follow-up to
Rice's critically acclaimed debut album 'O', which
has sold over 2 million copies worldwide, including
over 1 million in the UK.
