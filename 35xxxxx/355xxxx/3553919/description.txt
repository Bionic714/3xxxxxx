PLOT:
Once again Absinthe Films raises the bar to bring you 'More'. This title marks the beginning of a new era for Absinthe Films as they have broadened their scope to include and properly represent urban riding while still keeping the overall blend fresh and un-repetitive. Three years after first joining forces with the Air Burro Jet-Pack Camera Team, Absinthe Films is ready to unveil a new way of looking at snowboarding with the new 'Hover-Track' Jet-Pack camera system bringing you closer to the action than ever before and separating this film from the herd. Plus all of the technical magic, good times, deep pow, travel and massive jumps you have come to expect from Absinthe. All of this set to another unpredictable and fitting soundtrack that will have everyone clamoring for More. oh yeah.....and Travis Rice is back and it's ON.
