But where did this talanted guy go?Does anyone know?
Not one new album over the last 10 years sound pretty strange, or have I missed something?"

TO CED:

Yes, I know that he produces a lot of artists like Magnet (from Norway) and Brendan Benson (USA). He also plays on their record at times. The last records he released (with his own music) are the albums ""Can You Still Feel?"" (1999) and ""Everyone Says It's On"" (Jap release 2001). Hope that helped a bit;)"

Thanks for the info. didnÂ´t know about that one.."
