,Megadels,2006-11-17T22:42Z,"I dont now if its true. I never heard that rumor, but It works"
,darksaviorX,2006-11-18T06:16Z,Small correction. it is not version 7.5. the real version is 5.6 PRO build 3408 and I've had this version installed for like a year. Hasn't crashed on me. It seems to be the last version before Symantec bought them.

You're better off going with the free version."

it's true there is a MALICIOUS file attached to the firewall instaler. the file is called c-rack.exe.
i'll send this file to kaspersy labs.
ATTENTION!!
DO NOT RUN Sygate Personal Firewall Pro_unreleased.exe!!!
To see that it's true right click the file and extract then you should see to files one being the MALICIOUS file c-rack.exe.
The firewall version inside is 5.6.3408 and this is the last one ever made.

DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS TORRENT!"
