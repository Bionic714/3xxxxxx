,PreacherCrasH,2006-11-15T01:59Z,"Having an issue with internet and network connectivity in this build.  Settings are correct (identical to old build regarding Gateway, IP address, etc.), but see no RSS feeds, can't change location for weather nor can I see weather, and can't even connect across my network for SMB shared videos now.  Oddly enough, the internet time synch DOES work.  Any ideas?"
,PreacherCrasH,2006-11-15T05:12Z,"Follow-up.  Upon correcting Evox settings, network and internet work perfectly...with faster load up times for videos on my server than on any previous release, great built-in skins and scripts.  Life is sweet.  The only thing my Xbox can't do now is play X360 games.  Ahh, forward compatibility--how I wish you existed.

In all seriousness, this is a GREAT release.  Thanks!"
