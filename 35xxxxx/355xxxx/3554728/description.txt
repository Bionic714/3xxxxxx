Classic Yes is the second compilation album by British progressive rock group Yes. While the first, Yesterdays, mainly centred on their formative period, Classic Yes is exactly what it promises, a summation of the best moments during Yes' initial run as a group.

Originally released as a single LP with a bonus 45 RPM disc featuring live versions of "Roundabout" and "I've Seen All Good People" from 1978, everything has been compiled onto one handy CD. It was taken out of circulation by 2003.

Although it was initially not a strong seller, Classic Yes ultimately went platinum in the US and still remains the ideal entry point for Yes novices.
