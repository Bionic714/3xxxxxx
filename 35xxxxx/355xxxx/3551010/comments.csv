,FullMoonWoSagashite,2006-12-07T09:39Z,"I've been playing around with NWN2 updated to the most recent patch (1.03.835) for a few hours this evening and it seems to be running well.  It seemed to have no problems with dealing with my 1.00 saved games.

Here is how I did it.  It is NOT a crack, and has a few very annoying cons, but it allows me to play the updated version of the game.  No guarantees, but maybe it will help you guys who want to run this game with the latest updates --right now--.

You will need:

Daemon 4.08
http://ww2.cdmediaworld.com/hardware/cdrom/cd_utils_virtual.shtml

Poseden's no-dvd tool for NWN2 (or some other one in gamecopyworld)
http://dl.gamecopyworld.com/?d=2006&f=poseden_MAXI_NWN2!rar

The patch itself:
http://o.vnfiles.ign.com/nwvault.ign.com/fms/files/nwn2other/19/nwn2_pc_english_from100788_to103835.zip

The offline patcher:
http://www.casualcoders.com/utils/nwn2patcher.zip

Steps:
1) Install NWN2 to your hard drive.  DO NOT REPLACE THE EXEs with the RELOADED EXEs.

2) Patch NWN2 to 1.03.835 using the offline patcher, NOT THE MENU CHOICE IN NWN2.  Summary: unzip the patch and nwn2patcher to your NWN2 install directory and run the patch program.  Straightforward tool to use.

3) Install daemon (probably was installed before step #1 if you just mounted the NWN2 ISO).  Ensure all options (securom, etc.) are all set.

4) Mount the Poseden no-dvd image.

5) Start NWN2.

Notes:

1) I have tried this with 1.00 -> 1.01 and 1.00 -> 1.02 as well, and they seem to work fine (at least up to loading save games and moving around on the map; I didn't spend too long).  So in case the 1.03 patch breaks some functionality and you'd prefer an earlier install...

2) I have only tested the EN (United States) language install.  I think there is a hotfix for 1.03 for non-EN installs that caused crashing.

3) Pro: Since no EXEs are being replaced and from note #1, this approach is hopefully a
little future-proof for future (and I am sure there will be) patches.

4) Con: The Poseden image, while small unpacked, adds about 2 gigabytes to the whole game.  Just for a little disc check!

5) Con: The instructions from Poseden require disabling/disconnecting all optical drives.  I did indeed have to do this to get the no-DVD to work.

I am normally loath to upgrade if the game is working well, but frankly, 1.00 had a huge
number of problems (the one that led to my trying to find a patch is crafting holy weapons eats your reagents and leaves the weapon unchanged).  I am sure 1.03 has its own set of problems... camera angles are still wonky, I notice.  BTW, current game is about to begin Act III, and yes, *SAVE OFTEN* because the game (I was playing the 1.00 w/ RELOADED EXEs until today) is kind of buggy!

HTH,

Full Moon"

,pete1505,2006-12-11T11:41Z,"FullMoonWoSagashite's method rocks. I tried that and  the many issues (crashes, in game bugs) I was having with the game disappeared. You need the 1.3 patch and the  regular .exe for the game to work like it should. If you try to play the un-updated game with the crack youre in for a world of hurt. Also the crack didnt seem to work right with the 1.3 update- put you in some dm mode or something. I guess that you could find the 1.2 patch and play that with the crack, but I wouldnt bother


Fortunately for me, my optical drive was connected via a ide/usb adapter, so turnign it off was just flipping a switch. Thats the biggest hassle with his directions, disconnecting the optical drives.

No matter what I try... Now I downloaded the older clone cd thing from GCW and mounted it with Daemon Tools 4.06, and once again I get this:

""A required security module can not be activated. This program can not be executed.""

Note that this isn't because it detects the emulation, then it would just say ""Emulation detected!"" (like it did when I mounted with Alcohol 120%. When I ran sd4hide.exe it didn't detect the emulation but said this same error message instead). I haven't even updated the game yet, so you'd think it would run... But no.

But when I mount this ( http://m0006.gamecopyworld.com/games/pc_neverwinter_nights_2.shtml#Neverwinter%20Nights%202%20[MULTI4]%20No-DVD/Fixed%20Image%201 ) with DT 4.06 I don't even need pr0t.st0p or sd4hide.exe, it doesn't detect the emulation but just gives this:

""A required security module can not be activated. This program can not be executed.""

What's up with this? What causes it?? :("
,FullMoonWoSagashite,2006-12-15T17:36Z,"Hi folks, me again.  About the method I used above, sorry: I should have noted that I only tried the Poseden version.  But I am happy that this strategy appears to work for some of those who have tried it.

Now, for the meat of this posting (which will contain very minor spoilers, so quit reading if you don't want to compromise your gameplay enjoyment).  I finished the game yesterday, so at least it is confirmed that the whole game can be played through with the Poseden image.

Annoyances:
	* The game can be very jerky even though the graphics aren't much over NWN (which had no problems even on the machine I had back then);
	* AI stinks, especially for spellcasting.
	* Camera angle manipulation: ugh.
	* IMO the ending is disappointing; it feels like a rush-job ending, and is frankly uninteresting.  For a role-playing game, there's surprisingly little of that in the endgame.  The rest of the game, up to the ending wasn't too bad, though.  The final set of battles were boring.

I played on hardcore (friendly AOE should affect the party, and enemies should be allowed to get critical hits on us- there's a lot of that in the last quarter of the game).

The hardest battles, honestly, were in the beginning of the game (the bandit camp)  Later ""miniboss"" battles (golem/s, dragon/s, reaver/s, nightwalker/s) never needed a reload.  But by then, we had the missile storm spells, so that's a partial explanation.

The ending took longer to finish than normal (but still no need for reloads) because I never bothered to level up half the characters at all (and sold off all their weapons and armor).  In fact, nobody in my travelling party was level 20 because I was too lazy to perform the final level up before the endgame.

Since I looted the ""reserve"" teammates' gear (thinking I would not see them later), it was amusing in the finale to see half my team (e.g paladin, bard, druid) running around attacking the enemies without armor and weapons.  No prize for guessing who got knocked off first.  But that is fine because they were good meatshields while I was casting spells.

Just FYI, when most characters became available, I stuck with the dwarf, mage, cleric, and ranger.  I played a sorceror 10 / eldritch knight 9.  It's an ok combination, I guess.  Point is, if the above ragtag mess can win the game, most any PC can :)

Things I'd consider worth mentioning for your gameplay experience:

	* strongly consider crafting.  The party all used crafted weapons even when the more ""uber"" scripted weapons were given to us.  But only have a few who concentrate on those skills.  But remember some crafting is still broken even in the 1.03 patch.

	* sell equipment (particularly weapons) you don't need.  Cash is not a problem at all later, but for money in the early game, don't hoard these things in your magic bags.  Need quick cash?  Craft duskwood longbows or mithral/adamantine tower shields and sell.  Shopkeepers do have finite funds, but you should be fine since there are plenty of them.

	* I know there's considerable debate about monk vs fighter, but if Khelgar decides to follow the monk path, consider having him dual-wield crafted kanas: try +5, holy, and vampiric.  It's not much of an exaggeration that he probably could solo most of the campaign.

	* perma-haste helps progress in the game more efficiently.  There are at least a pair of bracers, boots, light armor, and a martial weapon that possess this important attribute.  You can always cast haste, but it's nicer not to.  Note: at least the light armor can be further enchanted.

	* Essential spells: missile ones (magic missiles, isaac's missile storms), elemental AOE (fireball, firebrand, vitriolic sphere), stoneskin, haste, summons (undead and elemental). Rarely used healing spells.  Missiles top the list for me - they tear through all bosses, and a sequence of level-1 magic missiles killed the final boss for me :)  Plus, how do you think Sand got the ""Dragon Slayer"" feat?

	* Don't sell the use magic device skill short.  T"

Hey there!  So i followed your directions to a T regarding the Poseden's no-dvd tool for NWN2 method of patching and it did end making some changes to my game.

Basically, I got heavy into Act III and did alot towards preparing for the battle.  I fixed many of the buildings, recruited, etc. with the original version of the game.  Then I ran into a dead end.  

First, the Nolaloth section was not available to me on the world map even after Ammon Jerro said he gave me directions.  This was fixed by the v1.03 patch.

Second, I did alot of quests up until I ran into my deadend; I had finished beating the first Reaver.  Unfortunately, it was then that i decided to start searching for Ore so that I can finish reparations and give the armorer ore to fashion weapons for the greycloaks.  And, even after the v1.03 patch, I can find absolutely no ore in amy of the sections still accessible to me.  here is a web page I found that lists sections that should have ore:
http://nwn2forums.bioware.com/forums/viewtopic.html?topic=530685&forum=110&sp=0

None of the sections I could access had ore. Any idea why?  Did I go too far into the game to turn back now?  The ironfist stronghold had doors that were unopened, but required a key; a key that I could not locate.  Don't know if I would found ore there either though.  

Third, do you know why alot of the sections have disappeared from the world map at the stage i am at?  I can get to some of them by going thru Ember and the caves of Duskwood (from Duskwood, some of the sections ""magically"" reappear).

Fourth, where in the world is the Tome of Iltkazar? And this supposed Crossroad Keep Escape Tunnel (see above web site)?

Lastly, the only way I could get the Poseden's no-dvd tool for NWN2 method to work was to physically disconnect my DVD/CD ROM from my computer.  Going to the device manager and disabling it didn't work.  Is there something else i could try other than opening up my computer everytime I want to play?

Pleaase help before i die of frustration.  Thanks."
,FullMoonWoSagashite,2006-12-19T10:24Z,"vlceks,

I don't know exactly where in Act III you may be, with regard to what quests you have already finished, but hopefully this information is fairly independent of quest contexts.

Without providing too much spoiler for others who may be reading:

(1) I read about a problem like this somewhere, and an Obsidian author replied to it.  The area should be on your map, but labelled as some vale or clearing.  If it's not appearing on your world map, open the console (` key) and:

DebugMode 1
rs ka_hotspot_show(""3090Nolaloth"")
DebugMode 0

I suppose this would confirm whether or not this spot was present or not, if a new location suddenly appears on the world map.

(2) Ok, I guess I also missed lots of ore spots, too. If you have found none, try going to ember to find the well + cave one described in that link.

One thing to note is that of the several ore spots I found, almost none of them highlighted with the ""z"" key (even in the 1.03 patch).  You have to kind of wander by it and face the character at the shiny area (here, it helps to have somebody who can cast arcane magic use the level-zero spell light to better see).  Once you find a vein of ore, you will receive an easily-missed note about it, and a piddly 50 xp.  There is no ore in the Ironfist stronghold itself.  I never went beyond the already-open areas in there.  Maybe there's a key, but I never bothered looking around.

You do not directly deal with the armorer and weaponmaker regarding the ore.  You will need to have hired the miner(s) - in Port Llast and/or in Old Owl Well (you can get there via the Duskwood tunnel).  Once those miners are in your keep, you report the ore findings to them.  Then you go into the courtyard to request to the blacksmiths about upgrading the Greycloak's equipment.  And each vein of ore you find only allows one upgrade on one armor or weapon, I believe, so you probably need to find about eight to ten veins to bring equipment to top levels.

I think in the end game, it doesn't matter, quality or quantity wise.  I can only really vouch for the second though, I had 100 Greycloaks only.

(3) I believe Neverwinter is in some evacuation mode, so that's why certain regions of that city are closed down.  Not sure why other sections are unavailable.  But this happens even during Act II.  I guess Obsidian figured it was not a critical section anymore.  Related scenarios like this exist even in the tutorial (once you leave the Starling house, you can't re-enter later).

It's kind of a bug to me that the Duskwood area lets you ""travel back in time and space"" to a happier Neverwinter.  But it's good to be able to do it if you miss out on the vendor items there.  Note when you leave Blacklake you have access to the old map.  But from other places (like Old Owl Well, Docks District) you get shunted back to the modern map when you leave the area, necessitating travel through the Duskwood area again if you want to go somewhere else in the old map.

(4) This tome (actually, I found two of them) I believe is on the second (or third?) shadow reaver.  I'm not sure if this is the reaver back in the revised West Harbor.

In any case, although Aldanon tasks you with finding the tome, he doesn't immediate recognize you have it.  When things seems stuck at that point, talk to Sir Nevalle (in crossroads keep courtyard, by the tower).  He'll fire off the crossroads keep siege/defense subplot that leads to the endgame - which is where Aldanon suddenly realizes/cares you have the tome.

(5) I can't really give much useful comment on this.  For some reason, now I am able to play the Poseden image without unplugging any DVD drive.  I have no idea why, so I guess my original quote is now inaccurate there.  But all I'm using is what I originally stated.

I strongly suggest trying out the complete craftsman:

,Lindane,2007-02-24T13:39Z,"Riddler-dk, I have a 128mb  gfx card and it lags me.. i have no idea what your using but you should definately go out and buy a 128.. haha almost every *new* game made is minimum 128.
 if your strapped for cash, you should look into an ATI All in Wonder video card, it is absolutely great and about $70 USD which is the best you can get for under $100 (works better then my dads new 256 nvidia card :P )

World of Warcraft works on my old computer and it only has a 32 erm or 34 w/e it is."

,jo0ker,2007-04-03T12:22Z,"There is a little trick when it comes too this game.

You have too inactivate your DVD/cd player/burner too get this too work. Too do this just right click on my computer then choose properties then the hardware part and then choose the unithandler? Aand from there you can inactivate it.
When youré done with that, just mount and file and let the fun begin..."
,Xaster,2007-06-13T16:44Z,"hmm..har ett litet problem här med detta; hoppas starkt på att någon med kunnighet om detta kan höra av sig. spelet funkar bra på min ena dator (den sege) men på min andra dator uppstår ett ganska konstigt problem som jag itne riktigt kan förstå vad det berors på, men är ändå tveksam om det är pga spelet..
Kan börja med att beskriva mitt system; Amd x2 5000+, 2gb ram, Ati x1950pro...drivrutinerna till grafikkortet är uppdaterade och allting flyter på hur bra som helst, utom detta.  
Problemet jag har dyker även upp när jag lirar Company of heroes, och det är exakt samma problem, men inga andra spel/program får denna kraschen. Här är problemet: sitter och spelar, ibland 5 minuter ibland 10, helt plötsligt släcks skärmen, och ställs på stand-by precis som att bildskärms-sladden dragits ur, detta gör att jag misstänker grafiken..allra helst eftersom ljudet flyter på och fortsätter precis som vanligt, och datorn låter inte konstigt eller jobbar hårdare.. Vad kan det vara som gör att bilden helt försvinner och att skärmen helt stängs av, (måste alltid starta om datorn ctrl-alt-del osv funkar inte) och varför uppstår detta endast på dessa två spel?
Är oerhört tacksam för svar! då jag befinner mig lite i panik här i törstandet efter att spela detta :)

ps. glömde nämna att den sege datorn prestanda = p4 2.8ghz, 2gb ram, och Ati x600 med gamla drivrutiner..ds"

,Aarnevaktis,2007-07-20T21:41Z,"Xaster... Du borde kolla så att ditt grafik kort och eller din processor har sina fläktar på full spruta. Jag hade samma problem med min dator... störande som fan, specielt om man sitter o lirar WoW.... "
