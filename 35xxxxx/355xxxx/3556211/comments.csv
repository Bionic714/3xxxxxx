,Pusher65,2006-12-31T14:47Z,"The clue is in the title 'Cracked'

Download the file and open then double click any 1 rar file and it will extract a new folder.

Open the new folder and double click the  'Sony self extracting packager' and install.

Once installed go to the folder named 'Crack' and open it and double click the file 'e-spmm 10' you'll be preseNted with a new window called 'Team EAT' Click the patch tab at the bottom and it will generate 2 new dll files.

Copy these 2 new files and navigate to Program Files - Sony - PSP Media Manager 1.0 and paste the 2 dll files here. If it says ok to replace files, click yes.

Now go an open the PSP Media Manager Program and it will work. 

Hope this helps :)"

,Torvid,2008-01-05T15:30Z,"Dosen't work on vista:(

But it works on my Computer with XP

Great Torrent!!"
,neocorpse,2008-01-18T02:45Z,"and you're surprised it doesn't work on vista how? Vista's the biggest joke since Mac's G4 tried to compete with PC's and failed miserably.
Do yourself a favor if you own vista, SCRAP IT. it's useless, and the most incompatible piece of crap out. Not that XP is much better, but at least with XP you know what you're getting, and it's compatible with it's own software.
Thank you for this, this looks like it'll be damn sweet! Cheers man :D"
,SpawnOfSatan31,2008-02-11T16:10Z,I does work on Vista you'r just too damn retarded to understand how you set compability to Windows XP SP2 just click on propertys-->Compability-->then X the box.. and you choose Windows XP SP2

,shankytown,2008-03-19T22:15Z,"I get an exception error blahblahblah..
And the file in the crack folder doesn't do anything for me."
,neocorpse,2008-03-20T03:00Z,"first off to spawnofsatan31 how the fuck can you get it to work on Vista if the fucker won't install asshole? shut your pathetic cocksucker and go back to doing what you do best, ass raping little boys in the park.
I get and error message that says ""Not compatible with windows 2000"" in Vista,  but if you right click the setup exe and switch to XP servicepack 2 in the compatibility settings it will install in Vista. The only snag you may run into is having to install netframework1.1 and netframework servicepack1. but it should be good to go after all that. I just installed everything and it runs fine. 
If you're having problems with the choices of frameworks just click the link in the installer and it will shoot you to microshaft's page and click the one that specifies for use with Sony Vegas, PSP and so on."
