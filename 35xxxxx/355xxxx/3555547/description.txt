Matt Bianco is a UK band that was formed in 1983 and continues to exist to date. They are mainly known for their success in the mid 1980s and their jazzy, latino flavoured music.

Hugely popular during the mid 1980s in continental Europe, Matt Bianco epitomised the new Jazz Pop genre that they shared with Working Week, Sade and The Style Council. The band name suggests that Matt Bianco is a personal name, but Matt is "a made up spy, a secret agent; we loved spy TV themes and film scores"

Formed by the late Kito Poncioni (bass), Mark Reilly (vocals), and Danny White (keyboards) in 1982 out of the shards of the abandoned art poppers Blue Rondo A La Turk, for their first album Whose Side Are You On? they hired unknown Polish vocalist Basia Trzetrzelewska. Her vocal arrangements gave the album a jazzy dimension that Reilly and White couldn't anticipate but made good use of. Hits like "Get Out of Your Lazy Bed" and "Half a Minute" turned Matt Bianco into one of the biggest acts of Europe in 1984. 

Mark Reilly and Mark Fisher are back as a duo and plan a new release in 2007.
