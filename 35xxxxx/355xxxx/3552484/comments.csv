,shakewell,2006-11-08T16:26Z,"This is worth watching just to see the look on the guy's face who works for NASA, when he's asked why the documentary is prohibited from taking measurements of the landing module door hatch. His eyes are wide like a deer caught in the headlights. 

Turns out there really isn't any room for those astronauts to fit thru the door, especially wearing giant pressurized space suits with bulky backpacks and other attachments. (All the documentation for the lunar module and dune buggy have been ""destroyed"") Then you look at the NASA film & photo prints, no stars in the background, because it was impossible to duplicate that artificially without astronomers figuring out it was fake. So they left out all the stars, you won't see one star in any Apollo photo.

Then you got that famous shot of the astronaut spacesuit moonwalk, with sceneic reflections in the visor. The other astronaut seen in the reflection has no camera. Also the photo is taken from an angle originating way above the ground. Many shots have shadows which conflict with the position of the sun, and with each other. And so on."
,DPStudio,2006-11-08T18:35Z,next 4 USA now is to send a missile to all the apollo landing site and clame a asteroid did it.
,PekkerCadette,2006-11-08T21:21Z,"This is *the* most amateuresc 'we haven't been to the moon'-film I've ever seen. He goes on for almost three minutes trying to convince You that *this* movie is *so*  open minded, thought provocing, yadda-yadda-yadda. After 15 minutes I had had enough and sent this to where it belong: dev null"

THIS IS REALLY EPIC"
,zombino,2009-06-10T01:27Z,"Lol, i love those arguments :) People like DPStudio and shakewell actually do not exist. Who financed this crap? BTW THERE IS NO MOON ANYWAY."
,shantheman,2010-05-14T23:42Z,"Zombino got that wrong ""There is no spoon"""
,general_monash,2010-11-28T10:20Z,"This is so absurdly amateurish I can't even fucking believe it. Download and see for yourself. The speaker is having a weird delusion of grandeur 'investigative reporter'! If you honestly have doubt about whether the moon landings really occurred, you should look carefully at your fellow travellers. Because you are fucked in the head."
,kritias,2011-08-06T03:43Z,"""If you honestly have doubt about whether the moon landings really occurred, you should look carefully at your fellow travellers.""
... fellow travellers? like who? I don't hang out with astronauts, and odds are nobody reading this does either.
If you honestly have doubt whether the moon landings really occurred, then you're on the path to the truth. If you honestly accept what you've been told without questioning the evidence then you'll never find out what's really going on, you'll just be manipulated into oppression.

On another note, this isn't that great of a documentary but it does make mention of several pieces of evidence that you won't find in any other feature-length documentaries."
,t7t76t,2012-04-01T09:51Z,"Anyone that believes that the moon landings were fake is just an idiot with either a history of drug use or an ego problem or both.

And that is a 1000 % F.A.C.T. "
,hippie2768,2012-06-09T14:05Z,"If you've noticed, most of the 'moon landing hoaxers' are from countries other than the USA. They refuse to acknowledge that the USA is the greatest technological country in the history of the world. Proof being, the USA is still the only country that has landed men on the moon, and that was almost 50 years ago!
 So long haters."
