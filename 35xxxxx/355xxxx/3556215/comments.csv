,klinej,2006-11-13T01:01Z,"quick question, I'm new to buring iso to a disk. Although not new to modding xboxs. I have a softmodded xbox. So if i want to run a backed ip dvd I download from this site then what do I have to do? Because I downloaded one and it contained many rar files. Do i have to un rar them or just put all of themin into an iso then burn?"
,moracca,2006-11-13T05:06Z,"unrar them...  you will get an iso file, which can then be burnt to a dvd or put directly on your xbox's hd using ftp, int the games folder that your dash's ini file looks for games in.  Then you can launch the game right from your dash without putting any cd's in.  Only problem is the default xbox HD isnt so big, so thats why its a good idea to put in a bigger one."
,moracca,2006-11-13T05:08Z,"oh yeah, I should have stated...  you should extract the files from the iso first if you're gonna put it on your HD.  that can be done using programs like Quix and Moogui.  Although I believe some dashes (like avalaunch) can load the iso directly without having to extract the files first."
