lookup RockXP in google."

Fuck off with the cheap worthless cracks. It's time to make windows legitimate in 5 seconds.


Don't open your mouth and call this a trojan without doing some research of what RockXp is first.
Try using google.
Try using a real scanner like Kaspersky, NOD32 or Bitdefender to scan this.
You can download RockXP from http://www.rockxp.org if you don't want to from here.
""Small Warning : RockXP is a tool that allow you to retrieve password. To do that, RockXP use a third part tool called Pwdump2.exe is an opensource software (Sources are included in RockXp). This tool retrieve HASH password of Windows. Unfortunatly, some Antivirus detect this tool like a Virus, but it?s not.

,millionmax,2006-11-08T22:46Z,"I have a problem and wonder if this crack fixes it:

 I downloaded windows media player 11 from another site and it was supposed to include a crack. 

 But when I installed WMP 11 the validation process turned out fine. Sadly, I didn't have SP 2 installed, so I installed SP 1 (I thought that to be pretty smart and thought I needed number 1 in order to get SP2 maybe I did, maybe I don't, let's get on with the story). After rebooting the computer windows gave me a very nice and amusing message, something like this: ""An error occured that did not let Windows check for authenticity"" or whatever. After that it went back to the log-in screen.

That pretty much sucks. Now I can only start my computer in Safe Mode which only lets me play FreeCell, and now I'm getting pretty good at it... and bored...

So my question is: Can I install this thing in Safe Mode and start my computer again and will all just seem to have been a bad dream or do I actually have to reinstall windows? (Luckily I lost my windows CD).

If I can't fix this shit I'm gonna cave in and buy a frickin copy of windows just to avoid the goddamned hassle! Bill Gates 1 - Me 0. 

Fire pon Microsoft with their expensive crap!

Very thankful if someone could please help me, or just point me in the right direction!

   5. Delete WgaTray.exe from c:\Windows\System32\dllcache.
   6. Lauch RegEdit.
   7. Browse to the following location:

Go to the programs website rockxp.org where they tell you the same thing."
,lele6719,2006-12-01T08:39Z,"Let me put in my 2 cents. This is NOT a virus -for sure.

_________From www.snapfiles.com

Why some programs may cause your anti-virus or anti-spyware scanner to show an alert?

These virus warnings should be expected for the following types of applications:

* Software that logs or captures keystrokes
* Software that monitors user activity
* Software that allows you to recover passwords or other personal data (such as RockXP -this torrent)
* Software that monitors or logs Internet or network activity (sniffers)
* Software that allows you to access or control your PC remotely
* Software that acts as a server (FTP server, mail server etc.)
_________

Now dig this! The key provided may not work very soon. Let me explain.

The WinXP key that the skankinred kindly provides with this download along with RockXP is a leaked Corporation key. For instance, a corporation bought 300 licenses of WinXP with only one key for 300 computers that may be used for some type of operations that are not connected to the Internet.

Therefore, Microsoft has no way of knowing if the key is being used until a computer is connected to the Internet, and Microsoft checks for its validity. It will always be valid for the first 300 different computers (any computers in the world) that share the same key. As soon as the PC 301 touches the validity test, Microsoft kicks in its WGA crap.

Anyway, I hope you have the idea. Just get a WGA crack handy. There are some very good ones in here ;) WGA may not happen to you, but it will happen to PC 301 ;(

Yet, WGA notification can kick in for any PC with valid key or not. Oh well ;)

,JohnyFiama,2006-12-22T11:26Z,"BEWARE: SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY DETECTED

First of all, I want to make it perfectly clear that I'm *NOT* a Norton user. And, I do not trust Symantec because of their bribery (ever heard of the incompetent C|NET ""reviewer"" Ken Feinstein's when he totally trashes NOD32? If not, google it!) and their diry tricks, bloat, etc. 
Let's get to the point.. I've used this tool with Ghost RegDefend, Latest NOD32 Standard Version (2.70.23) and other security applications. And, there is absolutely *NO* proof that indicates that this tool writes registry values to the registry, which is good. It only enumerates keys. So, no suspicion there.
HOWEVER, when I tested to delete the unpacked folder deriving from the compressed file that I downloaded, my Jetico Personal Firewall (latest stable version) keeps asking me whether rockxp4_.exe wants to access the network. 
Now, THAT IS SUSPICIOUS. Why? Because, EVEN *AFTER* I DELETED the freakin' folder, containing that file, it kept asking whether it wants to access the network. I even ran my jv16 PowerTools registry cleaner and CCleaner after deleting BOTH the compressed file that I downloaded AND the unpacked folder. YET, it wants to access the network!! 
Of course, there is something sneaky about this tool. And, since this tool never wrote any registry values, it must mean that it is HIDDEN *outside* the registry or it is injected in another process (that's what rootkits do). So, this may be a rootkit of some sort. But, I'm not sure at this point. 
SO, skankinred, I demand some explanation!! Please be specific about what this tool does to Windows. And for your information, do NOT try to fuck with me. I'm NOT stupid! I suggest you either PM me in private or send your comments here so others can see!! I leave it up to you! But, either way, I demand some explanation. "
,JohnyFiama,2006-12-22T11:33Z,"I forgot one more thing, I take this VERY seriously! And, any attempt to destablizie or threaten the security of my machine, will lead to actions against you! After all, I have the right to defend myself!! I suggest that you take these things into consideration!!"
,novem212005,2006-12-22T12:36Z,"JohnyFiama you are so stupid for making that extended comment. If your so worried about your computer don't download/use the file then dick face. Firstly, I've used this file and Nod32 picked up no virus. 

This file didn't work for my Media Center Edition and for some odd reason after using the program Microsoft's update page kept giving me a error and refused to let me update or scan my computer for updates. So to those a little suspicous about using this program I'd hold off of using it just based on my problems. 

Anyways, my Windows has been reinstalled and I now recieve updates including Windows Media Player 11 and Internet Explorer 7 using the WGA crack and a registry hack I downloaded from another site."
,JohnyFiama,2006-12-22T13:32Z,"@novem212005: First of all, don't call me ""stupid""/""dick face""! I never called you ""stupid/dick face,"" and, with all respect, I want to be treated the same way as I treat others. Secondly, I never implied that it is a virus. So, *of course* your NOD32 won't detect it as a virus. Well, mine didn't either. And, I'm also running the latest updates with hacked legit_check.dll, etc. That's not the issue. But, what I am saying is that it literally keeps sending packets to an outside network without the user's consent *after* you deleted the file. I've checked the hash algorythms for all the processes in the firewall config. table and all of them are different from each other. So, logically speaking, it shouldn't be sending packets to an outside network since the files have been deleted. So, I'm not making things up. The first part of your response is just ridiculous. Why using the Internet when you're not going to download stuff? Of course, we all take risks. Okay, my last comment maybe seems too harsh. But, it was my opinion and I accept your critism because we all think differently."

,Astrofly,2007-01-17T19:22Z,"JohnyFiama, it is not a good idea to blindly trust anything from the internet.  Despite explanations that any virus alerts are false, the question remains, why is the program sending packets to an external network? But the problem isn't with skankinred, the program rockXP4.exe was not made by him. It is from www.rockxp.org, and apparently they have some explanation of why it triggers anti-virus alarms. However, should we trust them? "

I know the reason that ur antivirus (and simular programs) are getting crazy. IT IS A HACKING TOOL!!! so if you can see the report from the program u'll see that its a hacking toll not a virus.

o för er som inte förstår så tar jag det på svenska.
det är ett hackingsprogram så det är därför som era antivirus program flippar ur... tänk på att kolla loggen från sökningen med era antivirusprogram så ser ni att det står ""Hacking tool""... "

,Keshicus,2008-07-09T04:30Z,"Ok few things about this.

It works. Just follow the directions in the readme and your fine. (If your stuck there then your stupid and need to delete this website from your bookmarks and possibly re-evaluate your life) And before I ran I, I scanned with Kaspersky and the type of virus it pops up as a password manager, so yes, some anti-virus services flag these kind of things as trojans but doesn't mean they are and are hellbent on destroying your computer. I checked everything and nothing new seemed to be added in registry or process so take my advice and trust the program. This one is a keeper."

,Shido1,2009-05-24T23:52Z,"Okay folks, lets finally put this to rest. 

Most virus scanners detect this as malware as it uses a tool known as ""PWDump2"", a program designed to pull password hashes from the Windows Secure Storage directory. The reason it trips the AV scans is because it is used for both white hat and black hat applications: Thus, this tool can be abused. Generally speaking, anyone who KNOWS the file is on their system put it there themselves and can safely ignore the warning. As far as I know, the program contained herein doesn't spread, manipulate itself, or otherwise act like malware. So, while your mileage may vary, this torrent is free of HARMFUL malware. 

TL;DR: Yeah, it triggers AV programs. This is because it is used to, among other things, change system files. It's a ""hack tool"" and is detected as such. It's safe."
,kadjubalanday,2009-11-20T08:30Z,"skankinred, would u be kind enough to post the instruction on how this thing works? I tried this many times but I coudn't make it work, my Windows Xp will expire 26 day from now, I hope u will help me pal, I believed this thing works, I dont care bout their negative comments, Im looking forward for your post. thanks and have a nice day pal.  "
,Madtechie,2010-01-15T17:47Z,"While its true, the anti-virus are giving ""A FALSE POSITIVE"", as PWDump2 is a hacktool and NOT a trojan, This torrent is pointless as all its for is changing the XP serial number to a VLK serial number (volume license).. 
But these are still getting black listed and if you had a previous crack installed windows update will also blacklist this serial..

So to sum up.. its pointless"
