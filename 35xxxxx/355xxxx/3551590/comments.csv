Everyone should  buy this. I'm ordering it, but I don't have the patience to wait for it.

The film industry should be aware of their classics, and make them available. I've been searching this whole city without finding a single copy. I'm ordering from outside the country... but as said... my patience isn't all that... 

Thanks a lot to the seeder!"
