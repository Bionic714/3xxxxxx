Q&A:

But I thought NTFS didn\'t fragment?

Every file system fragments. Microsoft has now also recognized that NTFS does fragment,
and even includes a built-in defragmenter in the latest Windows versions.

Newer Windows versions already include a defragmenter. Why do I need O&O Defrag as well?

O&O Defrag offers you much more functionality and better results than the Windows built-in defragger.
