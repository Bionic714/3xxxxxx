Thanks cultivator btw i downloaded it a couple weeks ago. But its one song i cant find. And i dont know the name of it. Anyone know which im talking about? Maybe he released it after the Confidence album?

Would be great if someone could tell me the name of it. Great song"

This ""Complete Collection"" is of course not a complete collection of all of Gentleman's recordings, but the complete collection of his albums. In addition to those, he have also released a couple of 12"": Superior, Rainy Days, Runaway, Dem Gone, Leave Us Alone, Jah Jah Never Fail, In The Heart Of The Night. 

So there are a few songs that is not included in this torrent. I would guess that the song you are searching for might be either ""Overjoyed"" on Leader-riddim, or maybe ""No doubt about it"" on Heavenly-riddim.

Good luck!"
