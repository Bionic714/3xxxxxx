On June 20th, 1977 at 9pm, the British Station ITV broadcasted a programme called, Alternative 3, a series of serious science documentaries that were produced by highly respected science reporters. It was simultaneously broadcast in the UK, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Greece, and Yugoslavia. However, it was never telecast in the United States. The documentary focused on a number of amazing "facts":

The earth is dying. We have polluted it beyond repair. The increasing "greenhouse effect" will cause the polar ice caps and glaciers to melt and flood the Earth. Extreme heat, such as that which is now inevitable,will melt land glaciers. That will result in a marked rise in sea level and then there'll be the start of the extensive flooding - with London and New York among the first cities to be affected.(Alternative 3). There are three possible solutions for mankind:

Alternative 1: Stop all pollution immediately and blow two huge holes in the ozone layer. This would allow excessive UV light to reach the earth and millions would die of skin cancer.

Alternative 2 - Immediately begin digging underground cities for the Elite (The "New World Order"?) - the lucky ones deemed worth saving - and let the teeming billions perish on the polluted surface.

Alternative 3 - Build spaceships and get the Elite off the planet - to the Moon and Mars. Kidnap and take along some "ordinary" people for use as slave labor. Use "mind control" techniques to control them. Leave the remainder of humanity to wallow in its own filth.
