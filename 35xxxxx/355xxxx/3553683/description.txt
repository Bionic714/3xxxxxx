X64 security pack V2 06 (HOLEBI)

*For excellent scanning and removal results, always perform your ad-aware and virus scanning in Windows ?Safe Mode?.
Enter windows safe mode by pressing F8 whilst windows is trying to boot up.

First install:

Eset NOD32 2.5
This antivirus software works very stable in a x64 environment.
It has one of the most update frequencies I have ever seen.
It often updates virus signatures twice a day!
Which means that the folks at Eset HQ, are working very hard to keep us safe.

Second install:

Lavasoft Ad-Aware SE Professional l v1.06R1
*Extra plugins are optional, and in no particular way necessary for better performance.

Third install:

AVG Firewall v7.5.425.814

This firewall also comes with a virus scanner.
I should mention that a virus scanner is a more delicate piece of software then a firewall.
So please bear in mind that whilst the NOD32 virus scanner was targeted and designed  to work on x64, the AVG was not. (perhaps a little)

So since Tiny firewall does not exist anymore, I have searched for other x64 firewall.(which was included in the former package) 
But none of any value exists. (perhaps ghostwall, which was far from perfect but free.)
This 32 bit Firewall is the best match for a 64 bit environment.





This package will work on all XP machines. (Both 32 & 64 bit machines)
But it was assembled with the x64 machine in mind.
