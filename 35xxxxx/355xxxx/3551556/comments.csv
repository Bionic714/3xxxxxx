,Capo88,2006-11-08T08:41Z,"Woohoo

No habla espaniol FFS!!!"
,elmoncho,2006-11-08T18:53Z,"You ignorant bastard, why the fuck did you delete the English audio if the original disc is a DVD5?

And why the fuck do you specify that the english audio is still present?

You and all the people who watch dubbed movies are just DUMB FUCKS.

By the way, I'm from a spanish speaking country. So you have no fucking excuse.

SOLO UN IGNORANTE REMUEVE EL IDIOMA ORIGINAL DE UN DVD"
,olip74,2006-11-13T20:45Z,"Yeah! Waste of bandwidth! Get it right up you!

,ursule,2006-12-28T19:10Z,Why oh why didn't I read the comments BEFORE wasting bandwidth on this one??? :/
,anne-li,2007-01-28T11:22Z,"Yes, I was disappointed about this - I wanted english language and swedish sub... But I have seeded properly to those who want it in spanish... Then I deleted it...

Jag tankade hem en avi istället:

Suben på den kunde inte min VLC läsa - men den finns fixad på undertexter.se
En lite ""kul"" film - eller kanske kult - som nybliven johnny depp-fan så var den helt OK... ;-)"

,s3x.m4ch1n3,2008-05-12T18:07Z,"would be funnier if there were english audio, fuck sake!!!!!"
