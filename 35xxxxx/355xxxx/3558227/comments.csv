,Ronafeld,2007-06-17T15:32Z,"Those who upload these movies with only 1 or 2 subtitles are IMHO not very smart huh?

1) Only the people who can read the language of the subtitle would be able to download it, and for that reason it will only be these people who will share it. Think about it. Maybe that is the reason that the these Torrents are always the ones where people whine Seed seed seed.

2) How much space does it take to add all the subtitles instead of just the single one 200kb, 500kb, 2mb? That is nothing compared to a whole DVD of 4700 mb is it? Maybe you will miss one frame somewhere in your compilation to make space for it is that too high a price?

3) IMHO when you do such things you kind of make a community whithin the community and IMHO if that is what you want then go make your own site and post your torrents somewhere else. Your Torrents may only seem like spam to the rest of us.

If you want to make a file interesting for people to share, then make the file attactive to people - then they will share it."
