It's not to be found on the original album, or any of the ""best of""'s I've come across. I've read somewhere on the net that it was on some kind of 7'' or 12'' release. Anyway, it's great, and if you have it, please share.... :)"

The xellent rack ""Get out of your lazy bed"" is a must for us who grove up on the 80:s"
,kuiksurfer,2008-03-02T23:16Z,"Matt Rules! Anyone got the ""Best of""? 'Cause the one torrent here isn't seeded ;-("
,swampmatt,2010-07-06T02:20Z,"Thank You xenu and to the seeders too. This is one of my all-time favorite albums! I bought the vinyl, lost in a flood, then bought the CD - lost in a theft, had digital copy, - harddrive crashed. I hope it's not bad luck to download this AGAIN! LOL Thanks!!!!!"
