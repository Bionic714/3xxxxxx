Apparently there are 49 files included, but 35 of them have a file size of 19 Bytes only. Why?"
,jacksecret,2006-11-09T01:00Z,"Sorry, Those 19kb files are my index files. I forgot that I had burned a data DVD of most of the files. If you open any of those 19kb files with notepad, you will see what I'm talking about. It's simply a disguised text file. Anyway, I screwed up and now I'm gonna post the whole season's videos. and no index files this time....
As for the videos you already have, there will be a folder called "".........disc2"" Just drop the working videos you already have into that folder once the client writes all the folders then restart the torrent client (or shut it off while you drop them in and then restart it....."
