search the networks for the xvid version.

A 73 minute experimental film made by Anders Weberg.

Filter is fully based on the emotions that I experienced in the beginning of 2006
when I woke up one night and found my son unconscious on the floor.
A couple of minutes passed by until I could bring him back.
The fear and desperation I felt during this time is what the film is all about.
