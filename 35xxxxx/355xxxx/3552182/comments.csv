,charlesb1,2006-11-14T04:36Z,"What is going on with this W2K installation.
I've burned the ISO file with Nero Image and all went fine.
When I went to install and booted from the CD after it inspect the hardware configuration it ask to insert the windows 2000 CD in drive A and it won't install at all we all know that drive a is the floppy drive What's wrong with this version of w2k with sp4 is it fucked up or what :("

not sure of the key..."
,crazy2be,2008-01-24T20:03Z,"based on the content of the other torrent (no key:( ), i think that what is ment is that you copy CDROM_NT.5, and rename the copy to CDROM_IP.5. you should now have 2 files."
,2p2buy,2008-02-02T05:07Z,"Rename CDROM_NT.5 to CDROM_IP.5. < this file is on the iso and it worked for me.

,ntoskrnl,2008-04-03T17:52Z,craig35: You'll have to burn the .iso using eg. ImgBurn (google it). Then put the disc in your drive and reboot your computer. The installation should start.
