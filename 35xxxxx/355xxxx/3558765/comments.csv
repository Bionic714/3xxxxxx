May just be Kaspersky having a bad day, but thought you may like to know."
,strider2004,2006-11-26T19:02Z,"I run with Kaspersky and my PC is clean, just to be on the safe side I scanned this file again 'no dangerous objects detected'  

I take these straight off each brand new CD out the wrapper so they SHOULD be clean.

Thanks for the warning anyway."
