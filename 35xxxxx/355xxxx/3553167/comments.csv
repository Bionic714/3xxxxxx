So in order to explain to the world, that Islam is a merely a childish peacefull superstition, they scream, yell, burn, kill, explode and destroy."

,Hasnain,2006-11-19T22:51Z,"In Pakistan atleast half the population talks shit about the mullahs and often jokes about them. Why??? Because Muslims world over are suffering at the hands of hypocrite and ignorant imams whom teach one thing but do another. It's just like Europe during the middle ages when priests were notorious for blackmailing poor people about going to hell or pay the church to be saved.

What angered the muslims worldwide because of the Danish cartoons wasn't because muslims have a bad sense of humour it was because of the pictures that depict Islam as a terrorist religion (bomb on Muhammed pbuh's head etc).

The taking of life is allowed only by way of justice (i.e. the death penalty for murder), but even then, forgiveness is better.  

""Nor take life - which Allah has made sacred - except for just cause..."" (17:33)."

,abyad,2012-06-28T07:11Z,"please seed! i am a new muslim and i find it less offensive than others indoctrinated since birth seeing muhammad (pbuh) being bombed on the head. as i understand, displaying images of the prophet are forbidden, but so is discrimination among the prophets as jesus(isa, yehsua)  is equal to abraham (ibraheem) is equal to muhammad. i didn't hear any muslims complaining about the passion of the christ, and it's clearly stated in the quran that jesus was tried and convicted, but that allaah saved him and another was crucified in his place. is that not blashemy to us believers? let us not descriminate among the prophets, and let's not ignore that material such as this exists. and if it makes you laugh, then perhaps you are sinning, or perhaps it is genuinely hilarious. god did not create us in jest, but he certainly made us with a sense of humor.
