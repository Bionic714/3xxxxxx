Here is included BitDefender Antivirus Plus v10
with keygen and a patch because some people have complained that after a while
it will display a message that the key has expired but that seems to fix the problem.
Please do read the ReadMe file in the patch\'s folder.

\"Keeping your computer safe from attacks now involves different types of protection. A BitDefender product offers four different kinds to keep you safe.
Rather than take the route of producing a single product aimed at meeting the needs of everybody, SOFTWIN has opted for the approach of having various flavours of its BitDefender solution so that users can select the most appropriate version that is best suited to their needs.  Recently I took a look at the company\'s BitDefender Antivirus 10 product which combines antivirus and antispyware features.  Now it is the turn of BitDefender Antivirus Plus v10.  This adds firewall and antispam capabilities to the antivirus and antispyware mix of the other product.\"

\"IMPROVED Proactive Detection
B-HAVE (Behavioral Heuristic Analyzer in Virtual Environments) emulates a virtual computer-inside-a-computer where pieces of software are run in order to check for potential malware behavior. This BitDefender proprietary technology represents a new security layer that keeps the operating system safe from unknown viruses by detecting malicious pieces of code for which signatures have not yet been released.
Permanent Antivirus Protection
The new and improved BitDefender scanning engines will scan and disinfect infected files on access, minimizing data loss. Infected documents can now be recovered instead of being deleted.
NEW Rootkit Detection and Removal
A new BitDefender module looks for rootkits (malicious programs designed to control victim computers, while staying hidden) and removes them on detection.
NEW Web Scanning
Web traffic is now filtered in real time even before reaching your browser, providing a safe and enjoyable web experience.
Peer-2-Peer and IM Applications Protection
Filters against viruses that spread via instant messaging and file sharing software applications.
Full E-mail Protection
BitDefender runs on the POP3/SMTP protocol level, filtering incoming and outgoing e-mail messages, regardless of the e-mail client used (MS Outlook, MS Outlook Express, Netscape, Pegasus, The Bat, etc.), without any additional configuration.\"

Enjoy!
