,Pooty29,2006-11-12T02:35Z,"The Keygen is a ""Trojan.Dropper.Agent.ES""  =(. For all BitDefender antivirus plus 10 release keygen Torrent.

So i have to open the virus keygen and make a new key every time i update?  and patch it again?
thats what im doing."
,Lava-Lava,2006-11-22T18:12Z,"I've had problems with bit defender, any version. I can't update, even tryed this one, no luck... What could be the problem?"
,Pooty29,2006-12-30T22:16Z,"The problem is all you noob ass report the crack and keygen to Bitdefender thats why they updated their software. And now the keygen doesn't work.


Bitdefender updated on the Oct 2006.

Anyways to update just follow the notpad info.
1.install
2.use keygen to make a key.
3.use patch.
4.check autoupdate.
5.after it autoupdate uncheck it.
6.use the patch again.

info: The update works once in 2weeks

,Murda Money,2007-01-22T12:16Z,The keygen isnt a virus. The people working at BitDef HQ just really dont like the idea of a keygen for their software lmao
,Pooty29,2007-01-24T04:01Z,"For most newbs that allow to send reports and virus to BitDef. The first v10 had a keygen that was a trojan. So when noob scans their computer they sent the keygen.

Thats why the keygen doesnt work anymore. BitDef updated there program. FUKING NEWB

Next time UNCHECK SEND REPORT n VIRUS ass hole. When CORE team makes a new keygen."

,phantom1911,2007-02-20T15:47Z,"And you dont need any patch.

,avseq,2007-03-15T17:18Z,"I don't understand what stupid morons like you are doing at TPB! I downloaded and installed this on my computer, and after 3 successfull updates, my subscription is active till 24th feb, 2008.
I used this key: 19E4243E56FFCADCC83C. (Now, don't tell that the keygen doesn't generate this particular key.)
And the patch??? Well, I just didn't use it. Why? Well, it was not needed.
Moreover, when I carried out a full scan with BitDefender Plus v10, it DID NOT DETECT the keygen or patch as virus.
Conclusion???
You guys are still at ""KINDERGARTEN"" at TPB!!"
,kestrel7,2007-03-20T00:47Z,"It has a Trojan, a backdoor and a keylogger. Thanks for the contribution."
,Blaseba,2007-04-02T17:11Z,"Hi i have downloaded and installed, and it all works. But i dont understand one thing... cant i have the autoupdate on?
In Pooty29:s diskription it says ""5.after it autoupdate uncheck it.""
Will it work with autoupdate on?"
,Blaseba,2007-04-02T17:21Z,"When i try to update it says ""Update error. Invalid key""
But under Registration Status, it says ""Registred by: Â´my nameÂ´"" and dont seem to be a problem..
But cant update.."
,gavinus,2007-04-10T09:17Z,thanks phantom1911 you rock!! at least now it will update for awhile :)

,gking1,2007-04-24T22:08Z,"Works Great
registered and updated
Thanks guys"
,redweed,2007-04-30T14:05Z,Bitdefender's integrated update system checks your license before letting you  update.  If the license doesn't appear to be sold to anyone it will report it as broken
,Dirty Freestyla,2007-05-01T08:24Z,is this or kaspersky better??
,davenator,2007-05-03T01:50Z,"Bitdefender sucks donkey dick.
Get NOD32 for antivirus. "

,bigballss,2007-07-03T01:21Z,"I wouldn't download this,  it doesn't help much."
,nonamo,2007-07-04T23:34Z,"if the keygen doesnt work for you, try this crack. it works FOREVER!!!!! updates and all!

rapidshare com/files/39352162/BDv10crack.rar

trust me ive used it for months, non of the keygens worked for me."
,fhakoff,2007-08-01T14:12Z,"Fuck, either this torrent is dodgy or this bit defender is as slow and fucked up as Bush.
It'll drown your computer unless you're running BlueGene/L or Cray XT4/XT3.
No my kaspersky and zone alarm didn't find any trojan, but so far it's taking me (over 30 minutes) to remove this piece of shit.
It's best if you roll back to an earlier image of your hard disk (if you had one, that is) to be on the safe side.

,wilky_88,2007-08-01T21:17Z,"ok this may be a dumb question, but...ive just used the crack that nonamo posted, and everything went smoothly, but when i look to update nothing shows up :s wtf? is that meant to happen? will it still update?

any help help would be great thanks.

wilky"
,unrar,2007-08-10T01:38Z,"major problems with this one. i installed it and everything was working properly, then i noticed a slowdown. it was small at first, but eventually led to a crawl. not on a slow laptop either. switching to kapersky."
,coke-boy,2007-10-23T17:54Z,i cant find nonamo's link -.-
,Antix66x,2010-06-08T00:24Z,Ok for all the DUMB ASS noobs first of all you are downloading an illegal copy of a software so that means NO UPDATES or REPORT OF PROBLEMS WITH THE AV and why you ask your self updates check for the genuity  of your key which means if you used a key gen expect your av to stop working and second every other AV will detect key gens and patches as an infection so don't be an idiot and use logic!!!!
