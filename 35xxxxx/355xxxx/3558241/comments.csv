,Osmooms,2006-11-15T20:41Z,The Rev. Ted Pike is an extreme right wing fundamentalist christian wanker
,ReVIsed,2006-11-15T21:31Z,Osmooms: Thats hate speech. And I'm not shitting you. If this bill passes you could be prosecuted for such outbursts in the future. 
,tomtomx,2006-11-15T22:16Z,Revised. Do you really believe that or it this only yet another example of how you spread your nazi/white supremaciast crap under false flag? As you know Ted Pike is one of the most rotten shitheads in the states and still mourns the good old days when he and his boys could dress up in white sheets and lynch people. 
,gergith,2006-11-16T08:21Z,"but tomtom... you you saying he's bad is no worse then him saying other people are bad, as soon as you start censoring beyond age to sex/violence you might as wel lgo straight to burning books"
,tomtomx,2006-11-16T12:38Z,"gergith: What I just wrote about Ted Pike was slander aimed at an individual and has nothing to do with hate crime. ANTI hate laws are aimed at people that spread deliberate lies to promote a racist or similar agenda. (Like Ted Pike and his KKK friends.) It's a myth that freedom of speach allows you to say whatever you want. We always had laws against slander, fraud etc. ANTI hate laws give a group the same protection that the other laws give individuals. Nazis, white supremacists and other racists naturally strongly oppose that and use irrational arguements as to call this 1984 inspired ""thought crime"" and other nonsense."
,ReVIsed,2006-11-16T13:44Z,"Ted Pike could esily argue you slander him on the basis he is a christian. The fact that you call him a nazi is merely a cover for the fact that you hate all christians. There you go. I just established legal grounds for indictment against you. Also, you could be sued for calling everybody nazis you know. In fact, the ONE person who spends most time on slander on piratebay is you. It's ironic isn't it? I'm beginning to wonder if, especially your self-hatred, but also your support of a terrorist-state at large, is the real reason you think everybody is out to get you = nazis are comming for you. *lol* Freak."
,tomtomx,2006-11-16T18:41Z,"That was probably the most stupid remark I've read here. No surprise since it's coming from Revised who uploaded movies claiming that jews eat small christian children, jews started WWII, jews were behind 9/11, jews lived in luxury in concentration camps etc etc etc. (How on earth did I get the strange notion that he might be a rebid nazi/anti-semite!!!? Must be paranoia.)
For the record. I don't slander Ted Pike based on that he is a christian. I slander him based on the fact that he isn't! He spends his time spreading hate through lies towards most groups but white americans. Christianity is about love, not hate, ergo he's not a christian. Neither is Revised (based on the same deduction). Almost all of of my close friends are though...
This is kind of weird:  Revised is PB's most fanatic conspiracy lunatic, who amongst other things believe that the whole world is ruled by ancient secret societies, all aiming to kill and/or enslave the rest of humanity. And then you try to make me look paranoid because I don't buy your insane fantasies!!!? "
,STGstylah,2007-05-10T12:01Z,"Interesting! As long as this Pike character makes such inspiring ""documentaries"", I don't see any harm. He has one single issue and goes on and on about it. I almost pity the man. Am not a christian and after seeing this, I am once more confirmed in my aversion of these people. Btw, I think I saw Pike's wife in a German bukkake movie a while ago. Interesting!"
