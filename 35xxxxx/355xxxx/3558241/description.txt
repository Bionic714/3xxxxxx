http://www.rense.com/general74/HATEBILL.HTM

\"Anti-hate,\" hate crimes legislation is touted as a sincere attempt to end violent crimes of prejudice. Yet nearly identical laws in Canada and some European countries have led to a virtual ban of public discussion on certain \"taboo\" topics. Also, public criticism of some \"identifiable groups\" can be a crime, subject to large fines and years of imprisonment.

In this unprecedented expose, author and filmmaker Ted Pike rips the cover off this little-known conspiracy against freedom by the B\'Nai B\'Rith and its \"Anti-Defamation League.\" Now is the time to protest to your elected representatives in Congress - before it is too late.
