,JohnyFiama,2006-12-20T16:07Z,"Seriously, this Symantec product is pure shit! Not only is it hell of bloated. It also makes your computer unstable (causes crashes, etc.) and slows down your machine due to the fact that it utilizes huge amount of CPU power (it's ridiculious, I know!). Besides, it is hard to uninstall if you don't have a good uninstallation strategy and the right tools/knowledge to perform a clean uninstallation. If you want something faster, smaller and more secure just stick with ""NOD32 AntiVirus System"" instead. The GUI isn't perhaps suited for regular home-users, but trust me: at least, it is reliable unlike Norton (which used to be great before Symantec bought Peter Norton's work). I would go as far as to not recommending this Symantec-garbage (or any other Symantec crapware) to my worse enemy. That's how evil this software is! And, by the way: I'm *not* representing any software firm nor am I trolling...just advising everyone who cares about their computers to watch out for this junk. Finally, there is absolutely no offence aimed at you, R4DZ1U. All torrent uploaders/seeders deserve all the credits and are highly respected by me."
