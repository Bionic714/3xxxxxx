An appreciation of George Orwell\'s 1984 and the enduring concept of Room 101,the psychological torture chamber in which Winston Smith finally cracked. This film is about Room 101 - the room itself,George Orwell\'s influences in creating it in his novel 1984 (his school days,his time at the BBC, Soviet Russia and communism), the psychology of fear used in Room 101, and its impact on popular culture since its creations. Broadcasting House\'s inspiration for George Orwell\'s Room 101 is demolished in the centenary year of his birth,artist Rachel Whiteread plans to cast the room in concrete as a memorial. Contributors including John Hurt, Michael Radford, Margaret Atwood and Tony Benn examine the powerful influence of Orwell\'s nightmare creation,and why the ideas behind it are still relevant today.
