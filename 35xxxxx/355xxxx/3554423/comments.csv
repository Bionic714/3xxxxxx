,domenicue,2006-11-23T23:45Z,"Any tip to get files made in ""Education Edition"" in Wildfire 3? Sick of it! Or where I can find it? Thanks!! "
,kissboll,2006-11-27T12:06Z,files from education edition can not be opened in any other program than the education edition... otherwise everyone would be using the cheaper education ed... I don't know if there is any program who can convert them... sry.
,kille22_kalmar,2006-12-09T13:26Z,"Can't get this to work. When I'm write my computer name as host name Installing PRO/Engineer (Step 2) i recive a warning. I can press cancel or Ok and can install it following all the steps. But it doesn't work....anyone else that recive a warning and knows what to do?? Plz help...

Thx for upload anyway..."
,kille22_kalmar,2006-12-09T13:32Z,by the way there is a program to convert files created in the education edition so they will work in others versions...I think this requiries a special license for the converter and you have to check a box when saving....I don't know how to get it or the name of this converter....but there is a way. I know that schools use this...if they make a job for companys.

when you install use the crack (in the crack folder on the cd). I had some trouble as well but it's not impossible. if you don't understand. google it. I don't feel like making a whole tut over this matter..."

Any answer.?"
,namgiaonline,2007-02-13T21:54Z,"Hello,
i have some question, hope you can help me.
I have installed Ptc-license-server, then ProE, chosen the option: Single-server , typed my computer name in the blank behind the port 7788, but it couldn´t find the license con the server, even when i start the server.
When i choose option :(Locked license file (no server running))  and browse to the license.dat(from crack generated) . It´´s ok, but nothing happened when i start ProE

How did you do it ?"
,kissboll,2007-02-14T03:53Z,"I don't use this anymore and it was like half a year since i installed it. Therefor, I do not remember how to install. I do know, however, that you need the crackfix. (see previous)

Take the time to read the ""README.txt"" file that comes with the crackfix and do so methodically(!) and everything should work out just fine.
I mean; if you download this you are probably an engineer.. use your brain.

I did experience some difficulties connecting to their server. Probably because it had a bloody hard day...
Otherwise this may be due to maintenance or your firewall. double check so you computer/firewall etc. allows traffic to their server. 
One other possibility is that they have found a way to block the cracked version from their network. But since other got it working i doubt that.

However, if anyone manages to install: please post how you did it so more people can use this software. It's a wonderful tool when it comes to engineering. 

And while I've got your attention: Happy valentines day! "

,koolier,2007-04-03T00:00Z,"HEY those of u wondering how to use educational and commercial editions, heres the info fro PTC:: 

Instructions for using EDU_COM_Convert Option
This document lists the instructions for using EDU_COM_Convert option to allow customers using Pro/ENGINEER Educational license to exchange files with customers using Commerical licenses.
Important Notes:
1. The EDU_COM_Convert option works only with the educational license of Pro/ENGINEER 2000i, datecode 1999500 or higher.
2. The license codes for the EDU_COM_Convert option are to be generated as floating only and need to be served from a license server. Please refer the Installation and Administration Guide for help with installing and configuring a license server, and for help with using this option with Pro/ENGINEER.
3. Caution: When a file is saved with EDU_COM_Convert option to be compatible with a Commercial license, it then becomes incompatible with the Student version. To make a file compatible with Student version, it needs to be saved with an educational license without the EDU_COM_Convert option.
Steps to obtain the EDU_COM_Convert option:
1. You obtain the option in the Pro/ENGINEER session from the Tools > Floating Modules Menu. This menu opens the Floating Modules dialog box, which lists all the floating options accessible in the current session.
2. Select the EDU_COM_Convert check box and click OK.
3. A confirmation is shown in the message window: “Option EDU_COM_Convert has been added to the current session.”
4. The files now saved by the Pro/ENGINEER session will be compatible with the Commercial license. This compatibility will be indicated in the message window at the end of a Save operation by the message “This file can be used by commercial license.”
Steps to release the EDU_COM_Convert option:
1. You can release the option in the Pro/ENGINEER session from the Tools > Floating Modules Menu. This step opens the Floating Modules dialog box.
2. Clear the EDU_COM_Convert check box and click on OK.
3. A confirmation is displayed in the message window “Option EDU_COM_Convert has been deleted from the current session.”
4. The files now saved by the Pro/ENGINEER session will not be compatible with the Commercial license, but they will be compatible with the Student Edition."

When running server diagnostics through the PTC License Server Tools, it showed the license was expired.  When i was looking through the license file i noticed that it's expiry was for december 31, 2007.  I tried creating a new license file today but it continues to produce already expired license files.  Is there any way to get around this?  setting my system date back a year also produced the same error and manually changing the dates in the license file produces worse results"
