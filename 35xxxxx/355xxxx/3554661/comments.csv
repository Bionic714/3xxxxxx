,brovo,2006-11-12T22:55Z,You get some Supremes as bonus or in fact this is not complete but mixed
,silentsprings,2006-11-15T22:05Z,"yea, sorry the last disc is the supremes, but the other 5 discs are correct"
,anvana,2007-04-17T08:56Z,"Hi AB fans,

seems the CD6 of this box is allmost equal to the 'Meet You At The Jazz Corner Of The World' album
(actually 2 tracks more here).

Would somebody seed this album, please ???"
,allloup,2008-06-02T04:31Z,"I'll seed this album !
Art Blakey was really FANTASTIC !
I discover him in the 60's and stay always a Fan ! ! !"
