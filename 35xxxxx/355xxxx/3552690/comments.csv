----------
The single player patch has been released here: http://forums.ubi.com/eve/forums/a/tpc/f/808101043/m/6051068105
--------------------------
I have tested this and it GREATLY improves performance and decreases the amount of crashes by 95% (removes ""Memory Reference Error"")
--------------------------
The crack DOES work with the patch."

,Ashendon,2006-12-31T15:51Z,"Why must those who think that their time matters more than others ask how to do something that with a little bit of trial and error or research always ask how to do something and want a step by step answer how to and right now?  Look, learn, listen, if you want it that much than do those three things."
,Madak,2007-01-06T16:43Z,"how do I update this game to patch 1,02? when installing the patch it says: ""Game not found, please install the game before applying the patch""."
,Dremth,2007-01-22T03:26Z,"Those with problems loading:

You may not have the right system requirements. Even with a computer far better than the recommended system requirements, I have some problems. This I doubt is because of the crack. It's because this game is very poorly engineered and uses very bad programming techniques that tax you resources much more than they should."

The game directory?? Where did you install the game on your harddrive?? or did you just push next, next, next and ok ok ok.. mindless installer!! pfffft!! The game dir (directory) is where you installed the game on your hardrive.. we have no way of knowing where you have done that on your computer.. go figure it out your self."
,CoffeeAndCigarettes,2008-02-07T07:49Z,"Ok, someone read this and please help. I've downloaded and installed this game. I did that patch thingie and replaced the mm.exe file of the game with the one provided by this lovely torrent. But the damn thing still just up and quits itself before the prologue can even load. It's played the intro videos and I've chosen to start a new game, and it doesn't get any farther than loading about halfway through the prologue ""bar""... like I said earlier. so I ask you, reader of my inquiry...
wtf?"
