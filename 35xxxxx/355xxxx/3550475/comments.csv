,matth87,2006-11-03T17:55Z,is there a  online version to this game? if so can you play it with this version?
,ladidadi,2006-11-03T18:06Z,if you downloaded the crack from gamecopyworld you wount get the cd key.. just so you know. its not the same .nfo as the one with the torrent.
[V],savox,2006-11-04T01:45Z,Ok after trying it for a day i must say its a MUST BUY game so i can play online. WOW it can be the best game of the year.
,Razit,2006-11-04T08:43Z,"I can't make it work... I get a black screen after starting from the desktop menu and nothing more. I noticed that there is a separate exe-file named -amdxp.exe (my cpu is a amd and I'm running xp, yes), but of course that didn't work either.
Any thoughts?"

,Metacom,2006-11-04T17:45Z,"First off make sure you are running the latest Daemon tools version.

Better to use a program like Pr0t stop, and update to 1.01 than use the crack and not be able to update till a crack for 1.01 is released.

If you are having the Black screen on load up and it hangs there, its your DirectX bugging out...to fix it do this: (windows XP)

Start> Control panel> Other control panel options (you may need to drop down the ""see also"" menu on the left> DirectX> click the Direct3D tab> Then click ""Use retail version of Direct3D.

If that dosent solve your black screen, see if your firewall is popping up and allow/disallow access."

Unless you're really desperate to try this game, I suggest you wait a few months so they can patch this mess up... It will save you tons of frustration. Don't get me wrong - this game has huge potential and I am confident it will eventually be better than its predecessors."
,kad153,2006-11-05T17:48Z,"Few questions:

If you patch to 1.01, does the crack no longer work? 

If yes, anyone know when a 1.01 crack is coming?"

They even use the same lame Character voice sets ""I hope you like pain!"" Anyone who played the first one will no what im talking about. Its like a big new module for NWN 1! Im so glad i didnt buy this piece of crap! 

By the way I downloaded this copy, and it does work.. Thanks to the uploader for your time.. Shame on Atari for Putting a $50 price tag on a game with 4 year old graphics!!  This game is  over 5 gigs, and i can tell you that its not due to the ""stunning, cutting edge graphics"", cause they SUCK! So that means that the game it self is HUGE.. Now ask you self, to you wanna spend a ridiculus amount of time, staring at OLD ANTIQUATED graphics?! Oblivion has set the bar for RPG's, and this game falls way short.. i loved the first NWN,..... 4 years ago...  Shape up Atari....

Sorry to the uploader, but dont waste your time, or bandwidth on this ""dog"" I literaly played this for 20 min., uninstalled it and deleted it.  It took almost 4 days to download!!

,fujji,2006-11-12T00:43Z,"You have to have a really crappy computer if you think the graphics are as Neverwinter Nights 1. zoom in on the characters and you will se its way better then NWN 1. And graphics are not the point to nwn. Not every game can have as good graphics as Oblivion. NWN 2 is one of the funnest and exciting RPG's in years. The story is great and its not like other RPG's where you know everything that's gonna happen all the time. In NWN 2 unexpected things happen all the time. And you get alot of choises that really shapes the character to make it how you want.

I Bought nwn 2 and I don't regret it at all. I really thing there is some games you must buy. And Neverwinter Nights 2 is one of those games. Its worth your money."
,fujji,2006-11-12T00:48Z,"Oh and one more thing about the voices and music of the game.

Its good that they kept some of the things from the original NWN. It gives you good memories. When it comes a secual for a game it should  have some things from the original game."

,Geraldoaj,2006-11-14T21:45Z,"Bigdice,

If you loved the firts one, then you surely know that this game is a TRUE CLASSIC RPG type based on Dungeons and Dragons Rules. This is NOT a silly first person action pc game with high-end graphics and low real rpg. Oblivion is good? Yes, it is very good, but it is another genre of game. Maybe Action-Fantasy style. I am of a time that i played RPG rolling dices on floor with game masters and all. I am sure that with some more patches this game will be better and better."
,bigdice,2006-11-15T01:40Z,"Ok, this is my last post. I was born in 75, ive played d&d for over 20 years.. i am fully aware of the rules and i still play 3rd edition. That being said, Oblivion is just as much an rpg as NWN 1 or 2  ..and just to clear things up, my computer runs this game just fine, on full settings. i just dont like this game.. is that ok? WTF?!"
,puhast,2006-11-15T16:51Z,"Hey guys.. Ty for ""seeding"" :) I'm seeding now everytime I possibly can.

I managed to install the game with no probs... But when I try to start it, an error message: ""Could not find any compatible Direct3D devices. The application will now exit"" After alot looking in to this I noticed that asian lion posted that he had the same problem... 

I think this is happening coz I use an old graphics card, (Nvidia GeForce Ti 4200) and it's not supported by this game. I was just wondering if there was any way to fix this problem without including me having to buy a new graphics card :) I'll be waiting for an answer...

P.S. Sry for the long post :)"
,burtbach,2006-11-15T17:17Z,"I tried so hard with this game - and ya know, its now such a bad game. Quite good really, BUT...arrrggh it crashes soooo much!! Especially when loading at world map transitions. I've given up with it now...its far too fucking annoying.
By the way..INFO about updating if no one has posted it:
I kept my original exe files before I cracked the game with the cracked exes available for version 1.0. 
Then I did the update to whatever it is 1.7 or something,,,then I copied my original exe files back over in to the main NWN2 dir, then I re applied the original cracked exes and the game worked fine.

,Evan010,2006-11-15T22:32Z,"First off BigDice, I don't think you understand what makes a game good.

It is not Graphics that make the game Enjoyable. Lets take Oblivion for instance, since it seems as though you have a fetish for the game. Oblivion has -0- Online gameplay, not even CLOSE to the expandability that Neverwinter Nights 1 OR 2 has, and can get fairly boring.

Neverwinter Nights, however, has online gameplay like no other. You can create your own damned worlds with its Toolset, NWN1 is still heavily played and is still enjoyable, as long as you're not ""OMG GRAFIX"". 

Whether you like to RP, PvP, or just go dungeon crawing hack and slash style, NWN's online will provide fun as long as there are decent servers out there. Not sure how many NWN2 has at the moment, but give it a bit and there will be many quality RP/PvP/Hack 'n Slash severs.


Oh, and another thing as far as Graphics go. Does WoW have good graphics? Not really. Does it have 7.5 Million people playing 15 bucks a month? Uh huh."
,snfinal,2006-11-15T22:46Z,I keep recieving an error that says could not find any compatable Direct3D devices can anyone help me to fix this problem

,burtbach,2006-11-17T12:23Z,"I bought NWN1 with all the expansions from Amazon for like £10 and since I uninstalled NWN2 I have installed NWN1 and I think it is a much better game. The graphics on the characters are a bit lame, but the overall world detail is just fine for this type of game. NWN1 is so much easier to play AND it feels far less linear than NWN2. MOst of all, it is so enjoyable because it runs so fast with no crashes. Loading times are swift as shit off a stick. HOW REFRESHING!!! NWN2 is one bloated mofo. FOr anyone with a slow PC like I would say NWN1 is the go.

This game doesn't even have the cool Dark Moody feel that NWN1 had, its like a little kids game.

,Reisende Mac,2006-12-12T04:33Z,"This game is so bugged I could cry. Fixed the previous problem by skipping the tutorial, thereby skipping the fight.

In addition I get stuck when trying to leave the village heading for Neverwinter, can't go back, can't go forwards.

Just a little heads up what you may expect, the game's forums are also flooded with complaints from customers. Glad I didn't buy the game yet, from now on I'll always download and try first."
,Tactical__,2006-12-17T11:24Z,"I have serious problems with this.

No matter what I try... Now I downloaded the older clone cd thing from GCW and mounted it with Daemon Tools 4.06, and once again I get this:

""A required security module can not be activated. This program can not be executed.""

Note that this isn't because it detects the emulation, then it would just say ""Emulation detected!"" (like it did when I mounted with Alcohol 120%. When I ran sd4hide.exe it didn't detect the emulation but said this same error message instead). I haven't even updated the game yet, so you'd think it would run... But no.

But when I mount this ( http://m0006.gamecopyworld.com/games/pc_neverwinter_nights_2.shtml#Neverwinter%20Nights%202%20[MULTI4]%20No-DVD/Fixed%20Image%201 ) with DT 4.06 I don't even need pr0t.st0p or sd4hide.exe, it doesn't detect the emulation but just gives this:

""A required security module can not be activated. This program can not be executed.""

What's up with this? What causes it?? :("

Kan börja med att beskriva mitt system; Amd x2 5000+, 2gb ram, Ati x1950pro...drivrutinerna till grafikkortet är uppdaterade och allting flyter på hur bra som helst, utom detta.  
Problemet jag har dyker även upp när jag lirar Company of heroes, och det är exakt samma problem, men inga andra spel/program får denna kraschen. Här är problemet: sitter och spelar, ibland 5 minuter ibland 10, helt plötsligt släcks skärmen, och ställs på stand-by precis som att bildskärms-sladden dragits ur, detta gör att jag misstänker grafiken..allra helst eftersom ljudet flyter på och fortsätter precis som vanligt, och datorn låter inte konstigt eller jobbar hårdare.. Vad kan det vara som gör att bilden helt försvinner och att skärmen helt stängs av, (måste alltid starta om datorn ctrl-alt-del osv funkar inte) och varför uppstår detta endast på dessa två spel?
Är oerhört tacksam för svar! då jag befinner mig lite i panik här i törstandet efter att spela detta :)

Here are some instructions for you!
When a torrent comes in multiple .rar files that all have the same name except for a number by them dont extract them individually. Select all the .rar files except the one that ends in .sfv and extract them all to the same folder.
I realize these instructions are somewhat vague but I think if you just remember this and use your brain you should be able to figure out how to do it. Good Luck!"

1) Download the torrent and whine about amount of seeders.
2) Open any of the .rar folders and extract it wherever you want.
3) Double click the nwn.iso you just extracted to extract it aswell.
4) Generate keygen, launch the setup.exe, insert the CD key, install the game.
5) Let it auto-update to newest version, then replace nwn2main.exe with cracked one and play."

I've been able to install it no problem, but I'm getting hung up on the no CD part. Could someone explain in as much detail as possible how -exactly- it works, starting from right after I finish updating the game to the newest version?

What I've garnered about the mounting process (I'm new to internet-downloaded games, this is my first.) is also very sparse, there's a probability that my problem may have its roots in having extracted the files the wrong way somewhere. Although if it was able to install perfectly, that seems unlikely.

Or, even better, a walkthrough from what you do after the torrent finishes downloading, including what programs to use to mount (I still don't get the term) the .iso and everything.

Feel free to call me a noob for posting such a long message and not having prior experience."

3. Download the crack from gameburnworld:(http://www.gameburnworld.com/gp/gamefixes/neverwinternights2.shtml)

I uninstalled.
Reinstalled.
Offline patched to V. 1.06.980.

I am now able to select skills from the character build when starting a game.
However, I am unable to see any character to change the appearance.

Which patch fixes the non-seen character issue.
It is not to much of a problem, as I still have my saved game, but incase I want to start over or when I play MOTB, I am unsure as to what to do.

Any more help will be greatly appreciated.

I had to download 5 different patches to get up to V 1.06.980:
In this order
1.00788 (beginning version) to 105910
105910 to 105912

Runs like a fucking dream.

If you like this kind of game, this is sure to please. Great story, cut scenes really make it come alive. With limited NPC choices they went all out on dialog between them- always at each other's throats. The graphics are great compared to the old Baldur's Gate engine, but most of the time I'm still playing from that angle, so I don't get to appreciate it until I zoom in on a fight or something.

What you may read elsewhere about  ruinous bugs is bullshit- maybe in older versions but not in 1.11.

I couldn't wait for MotB, so I installed, ran the auto patch (good time to find something else to do, it takes well over an hour), and then applied the fix from gameburnworld.

Cccpirate, thanks, without your advice I'm not sure how I would have proceeded.

Worth it in the end though, one thing DnD always lacked was graphics and this one has some pretty good ones.   Read some comments, bigdice and Sleppmegin need to take a chill pill, no game is perfect.  The reason the game is so large is that there is so much you can do with it, and graphics aren't cutting edge, but pumped all the way up they are pretty darn good.   They made the game so you can make your own dungeons/campaigns and a bunch of other editing options, and able to share with your friends and others.   On top of that you can multiplayer either with internet connection or LAN which is a great feature.   Don't knock a game till you've really explored all of the details ;)"

Graphics are great the storyline is very enjoyable and thrilling at times.
endless diffrent builds for classes etc.

Ive only installed mask of the betrayer couple days ago but that adds even more stuff to the game..new classes/stuff/spells etc.

However the storyline is ""more"" straightline then for exsample BG2. And sometimes have harder time using the camera after i installed MOTB.

(using mouse to change angles is too fast somehow)

But thats the only things that are negative really.

Still the best game out there. HF everyone.

ps. for those who have MOTB Installed (expansion) and have probs with the first shard quest u need to patch.

,Jonesing,2008-05-23T17:59Z,"Wow, installing this on windows 2000 was a nightmare, here's how I finally got it to work:

mount and install it as per normal.

REBOOT before updating, it doesn't tell you to do this but it didn't work without it.

run the updater and be prepared to wait 30 minutes for all the patches to download and install.

there doesn't seem to be a cracked exe out there for the latest patch so go to www.gamecopyworld.com, find neverwinter nights 2 in the pc game index then look for the link to:

'Neverwinter Nights 2 [MULTI4] No-DVD/Fixed Image #1'

follow the instructions on the page (you will need another 3 gigs of hard drive space to extract the image). Despite what the instructions say I didn't have to disable my DVD drive to get this to work so give that a try.

what is the problem? help me!"
,jinxhacker,2008-06-18T09:24Z,"To those who can't see characters!

It have helped to me resolve this problem:

1. Instal the game.
2. Run updater.
3. Go to official. http://nwn2.obsidian.net/support/patch_updater.html and download NWupdate v1.08
4. Run this updater.
5. Go to http://www.gameburnworld.com/gp/gamefixes/neverwinternights2.shtml and download ""NEVERWINTER NIGHTS 2 v1.06.980 [ENGLISH] NO-CD/FIXED EXE (12.5MB)""
6. Replace downloaded files."
,Nostro333,2008-06-21T22:28Z,"Okay , probably a lot of ppl mentioned this before , but im gonna say too : If you EVER have problems with missing archives when extracting with winrar or any other missing files (during installation, extraction etc) , always force a hash recheck in your torrent downloader client.In many cases ,after that check you will see that you only got 99.9% which was obviously the reason for errors."
,andrekalim,2008-06-23T02:13Z,"I am having this ""Could not find any compatible Direct3D devices"" problem.

I tried to install this program called ""3danalyzer v236"" (posted by Grashopa on page 14) but it did not solve the problem. 
Maybe it's because i couldn't configure it properly.

Does anybody know any other way to get around this ""Could not find any compatible Direct3D devices"" ?

Please!"

I personally have a tremendous amount of free space and I can deal with it (for now) but there's no reason for this, STOP BREAKING THE FILE INTO A MILLION PIECES. THERE'S NO EXCUSE, I DON'T CARE WHY YOU'RE DOING IT. JUST STOP."

Actually the reason for doing this is in case the download is corrupt, you will only have to redownload one of the parts rather than the entire thing all over again. It's not that hard to just leave a little space. And once you unrar it, you can just throw the rar files away. No biggie."

Actually, bittorrent clients don't work like that.  If a part of the file is corrupt, all clients will check the downloaded file against the hash, and it will re-download the corrupt parts.

The reason for multiple rars is because the scene is stuck in the early 90s.  They think people are on dialup and only have CD burners."

Playing online is worth the money by the way. I've played several MMORPG's (from Word Of Warcraft to Runescape, Ragnarok etc...) and I can say that NWN was one of the better I played.

The campaign, however, are mostly a big dissapointment."

	Complete instructions for installing this download, as well as both expansion packs. 

Using this method, you'll have all three installs, fully patched, with crack. Obviously, Multiplayer will NOT work as you need an account to play on their servers. So just fucking forget about that. Serious. Like, right now.  Follow instructions precisely or your on your own. 

Download these files, here at TPB. 

1) http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3550475/Neverwinter.Nights.2-RELOADED

2) http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3820777/Neverwinter_Nights_2_Mask_of_the_Betrayer-HATRED

3) http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4520920/Neverwinter_Nights_2__Storm_of_Zehir-ViTALiTY

Do yourself a favor, and just download them completely before you get started. They are all from top-rated scene folks, so pretty damn safe, and most importantly, they WORK. Flawlessly, if you follow my instructions to the letter. 

You'll also need to download the patches and a tool to install them. 

Let me explain. The patcher the game tries to connect to will not work with the cracked game. It knows you have a bogus install. Don't bother. The patches themselves are not executables, thus the tool needed to install them. Both the patches and the tool are from a reputable NWN2 gaming site. You will only need TWO patches. What I found is that all the previous patches are on the xpacs and install when you install the xpacs. So no need for the 200MB or so of downloads. JUST the following two(for the last xpac).

Ok, here is the fun part! You might want to copy these instructions. Be sure to disconnect from the web or firewall that fucker so it doesn't connect to NWN2 servers, do NOT let ANY of the installs auto-patch. If it wants to install the .NET 2.0 framework, let it, or you can't play.  

1) Unpack and mount the ISO from the ""RELOADED"" download using any discdrive emulator (I use Daemon Tool Lite).

2) Install game using the following key: GREAT-GREAT-GREAT-GREAT-GPE3T-6REA4-GVEXT

3) Do NOT copy the cracks into the game directory, repeat, do NOT replace any files at this point. 

4) The basic game should be installed, but not patched. Do NOT run the game yet. 

5) Unpack, Mount and Install the download from ""Hatred"" using following key: 
	HTD9P-V6GA7-AFKDX-PR3AT-KH4MT-GGTG9-RTL33

6) Again, do NOT install the crack, this time either. And don't fucking run the game. Patience.  

7) Unpack, Mount and install the download from ""ViTALiTY"" using the following key:
	7W7LA-FJ3PN-DXPGK-NYHCW-AHACY-QAHQN-E9PAH

8) You should now have all 3 games installed. Do NOT apply the crack yet!

9) Unpack the Patcher you downloaded and run it. Select the patch (nwn2_pcx2_english_from1201541_to1211549) that you downloaded earlier, hit the patch button and let it do its thing. Repeat with the other one(nwn2_pcx2_englishvofix_from1201541_to1201541) then close the patcher. 

10) Remount the ISO from ""ViTALiTY"" again, and copy the two .exe files in the crack folder located there and drop them on the NWN2 directory in C:/program files. Say ""yes to all"" when it asks. You ONLY need the crack from the LAST expansion! DO NOT USE THE CRACKS FROM THE FIRST TWO INSTALLS. 

11) You should now have the Basic game and all the expansions installed, patched and cracked. Play like normal. Just remember to never connect to the multiplayer servers or let the game try and patch itself, and it should run fine all the way to the end, as well as give you full access to the world builder tool. 

Enjoy!

,bugnexus7,2009-02-07T10:31Z,"Bugnexus's Game Torrenting/Cracking Philosophy...(posted in response to someone bitching about my above instructions)

	I FUCKING HATE DRM. 

	In my computer newb days, I replaced three perfectly good disk drives simply because SecuROM was installed on my computer when I installed some games, without my knowledge(it had disabled the drives to prevent me from copying disks when I had NO FUCKING INTENTION of copying them, and ""forgot"" to turn them back on after I uninstalled the games). 

	I've also paid about $900 bucks so far for games that simply didn't run on my machine(the mins. sys. requirements were a fucking lie) and couldn't return them because I had the temerity to try and play them. So here is my philosophy, in a nutshell.  

1) Always download and install a game before buying it. TEST DRIVE THE FUCKER. If it works, and you LIKE IT, BUY IT!!!
    Dead serious about buying it. If they guys making these games don't get paid, they stop making them. Simple as that. 
    BUY IT IF YOU LIKE IT. 

2) If the DRM on the game is anything more serious then a CD/check or an Installation key, DO NOT BUY IT. (Fuck you       SecuROM, and your mothers as well, since I'm at it...). Serious. As long as they pack that crap in games, and YOU pay for it, they will continue. Speak with your money.

3) No Demo? See rule #1

Simple as that. Don't like my philosophy? Good for you. "

And yes, to all ppl who are wondering if they will be able to play NWN2 (w'out the 2 expansions as mentioned in the links by ""bugnexus7"", then YES !! u CAN play this game w'out the need of the other 2 expansions.. :) 

just use the crack in the original NWN2-Reloaded ISO (mounted using daemon tools or power ISO) after installing the game..

===============

and to all those iDiots (with a capital ""D""  for dumb) screaming at the top of their lungs to ""seeed... with multiple ""EEE's...), jus SHUT UP and first set ur upload limit to 80% of ur d/oload limit and then see how ur d/load for this torrent as well as for many other torrents jus shoots up (in speed)....

DO NOT expect ur d/load speed to be 100Kbps wen u are jus uploading at 10kbps... u morons..... !!!! (jesus....)......

,bugnexus7,2009-08-04T05:00Z,"redfordrj:

You need to use a tool such as Daemon Tools Lite (what I use) and ""mount"" that .iso file in a virtual drive. The .iso is essentially a ""picture image"" of the original disc+crack folder+info file. 

When you use Daemon tools to ""mount the image"", your basically fooling your machine into thinking that there is a real disc in a real drive, just like there would be if you took an actual install/game disc and stuck it your cd-drive. "

,bugnexus7,2009-08-08T02:50Z,"Tom_379:

Yes, you can play it over a LAN, as well as a WAN, just not utilizing the official NWN2 servers. 

In order to do so, create firewall rules that allow NWN2 to access your ""Trusted"" zone, but NOT the internet zone. 

Once you have done that, add the IP addresses of the people you want to connect with to the firewall ruleset and allow them through your firewall. I'm not going to even try and explain exactly how to do that as every firewall is different. 

You'll just have to figure that part out yourself. 
I know it works because I've already done it. "
,bugnexus7,2009-08-08T02:56Z,"ryder121:

Did you do the install as I described it in my post on page 18 of the comments, or did you just install the original game and not the expansions?

I had numerous problems with the game when I did NOT use the expansions. To be quite honest, the game sucks ass without the patches, and patching the original release and NOT the X-pacs doesn't seem to work. The patcher hangs up on several of the patches. Not to mention the fact that there are over 10 patches just for the original game and only two for the whole series. WAY easier to just follow my instructions, even if you have no intention of playing the additional content. 

For those of you that plan to use the NWN2 Toolset, keep in mind that the patches ALSO patch the bugs in the Toolset making it far less buggy and more stable. "
,bugnexus7,2009-08-08T03:00Z,"Tom_379:

In addition, whoever is going to host the game also has to allow the game to act as a server in the firewall rules. 

ZoneAlarm makes all of what I described VERY easy to do. It is just a matter of going to program control and checking the appropriate boxes. "
,bugnexus7,2009-08-08T03:09Z,"For those of you that only want to patch the original game and not the whole series of expansions, you will need the following patches.

this is what you have to do

install each game and let them update using the updater, it is fine as long as you dont play the game or use any cracked exe, it just updates normally.

download the mini-image from :

http://m0004.gamecopyworld.com/games/pc_neverwinter_nights_2.shtml#NWN2:%20Storm%20Of%20Zehir%20[MULTI5]%20No-DVD/Fixed%20Image

NWN2: Storm Of Zehir [MULTI5] No-DVD/Fixed Image 

mount it using daemon tools light 4.30.3 or newer.

play the game, it works perfectly.


DO NOT use cracked Exe files
DO NOT use YASU

either of those will cause the game to not function at some parts, or not at all.

very frustrating to figure out on my own, but it does work if you only use the auto-updater then a mini-image and nothing else."

I downloaded this, and the expansions, and I've encounterd quite a lot of problems.

I have reviewd all the comments listed before mine, in hope to find a solution but I was unsuccessfull.

My first problem was that I was unable to see my character in character creation. When I followed Bubneux7 tutorial and the problem was solved. But I have deeper issues now.

When I get to all the loading areas outside the grafic is extremly glitched. It is impossible to play because it's white everywhere with just the shadows of my characters and some models loaded. I think the problem lies at the loading screen when it has passed ""Loading module- arena 1-23"" and when it gets to like, arena update 1-2 (When it loads area update 1-2 then the game becomes unplayable due to the glitch).

There was also a guy with the same problem but just saw a black screen and said it was just a matter of grafic changes to fix it but I have tried everything. The best that I've managed to fix is 1/4 ( top left screen ) it ok, still have glitches but totaly playable if it would cover the rest of the screen. (It is when Water reflections is enabled that I can see some things in the left corner)

But other than that I'm unable to fix. Tried some different cracks but now the game just crashes at start so will have to re install it anyhow, and though I might follow someones tip at the installation if you have a clue/suggestion on how to solve the problem.

,bugnexus7,2011-04-27T06:09Z,"Greetings, all

My previous instructions for Neverwinter Nights 2 are out-dated. This post corrects and vastly simplifies the whole process. It also makes sure you have full use of the game, both expansions and the Mysteries of Westgate add-on by Ossian. These instructions also enable MULTIPLAYER (woot!) over a LAN (WAN if you are using Hamachi2). That's right, LAN play! The regular hosted servers will NOT be usable, and connecting to them might actually disable this whole process. DON'T FUCKING DO IT!

Before you continue with downloading the files, make sure you read this entire post as I am going to make you jump through some hoops, and you need to decide if it is worth it before you download. You will not be using ANY Cracks that are supplied with the .iso files. Don't be tempted--they just break everything. All DRM is removed with the Ossian Add-on (Yay!).

I have altered my PC configuration since the last time I posted here, as well as started using different software. I actually went back to some older versions, as they worked better with older games. 

My PC (pretty basic):
Windows XP Home SP2 (and these instructions ONLY apply to this OS...sorry.)
Pentium 4 (2.9 GHZ)
2 GB RAM
Montego 5.1 sound card
Nvidia GeForce 9500GT

I also HIGHLY recommend the use of ZoneAlarm Free Firewall for gaming--simple inteface and very versatile. It is also what I use and it will make more sense to you when I mention firewall notices that will pop up.

,bugnexus7,2011-04-27T08:26Z,"When you have EVERYTHING downloaded, follow these instructions to the tee...
(Do NOT put the ISO files you download on a separate drive then where you install the game--it will slow the install process dramatically!)

1. Install Auslogics Disk Defrag and run it. Defrag your default drive (the one your going to install everything else on).

2. Disable your Internet connection (best to physically unplug cable/adapter--otherwise goto Network Places and right-click active connection, select Disable)

3. Install the newest video driver, DirectX 9.0c, .NET 2.0 SP2, C++ Redistributable and Hamachi2. (You're on your own as far as Hamachi goes, but it should be self-explanatory. You will need to make firewall exceptions for all of thr IP addresses using Hamachi (right there in the UI))

4. VERY IMPORTANT! Run Auslogics Defrag! As you can see, installing all of that stuff messed things up pretty good, and it will with each installation. It will run pretty fast since you've done it once already.

5. Open the Neverwinter.Nights.2-RELOADED folder and select ALL the files except the .nfo file and the .sfv file. Right-click and select ""Extract to /Neverwinter.Nights.2-RELOADED"". You should have an .ISO file in a folder now. "
,bugnexus7,2011-04-27T08:27Z,"6.Run Deamons Tools and left-click the taskbar icon and mount that same .ISO file you just decompressed. If you have Autorun enabled (silly...), the installer will start. Otherwise, run setup.exe and install using the following serial key:
GREAT-GREAT-GREAT-GREAT-GPE3T-6REA4-GVEXT
Do not install XFire if it asks. If your firewall asks for permission to connect to the internet, deny/remember it. You never want the game itself actually connecting until I tell you when. The game should complete installation.

8. Unmount the RELOADED .ISO from Daemons tools. 

9. Run Auslogics again. It should be pretty quick.

10. Mount the Neverwinter Nights 2 Mask of the Betrayer [PC-DVD] [Multi5] .ISO file in Daemon Tools. Install the expansion using the following serial key:
GREAT-GREAT-GREAT-GREAT-GPE3T-6REA4-GVEXT
No XFire, no firewall passage. Unmount from Daemon Tools and Auslogics again.

11. Mount the Neverwinter.Nights.2.Storm.of.Zehir-ViTALiTY .ISO file and install the expansion using the following Serial key:
7W7LA-FJ3PN-DXPGK-NYHCW-AHACY-QAHQN-E9PAH
Same as last install. Auslogics. "
,bugnexus7,2011-04-27T08:27Z,"12. Re-connect to the Internet. Goto the Start Menu/Programs and run the ""Update Neverwinter Nights 2"" in the Atari folder. Allow it through your firewall this one time. This will take awhile to update. It might pop up some red text saying it couldn't find a file (for me this was vnfiles.ign.com but it immediately found the file at downloads.atari.com). If your firewall asks, let it through. Let it finish updating completely. 

13. Auslogics again (I mean it...your HD would be a fucking mess by this time if you hadn't been defragging each step. I suspect THIS is what borks a lot of peoples installs and causes most of the problems in this comment section).

14. Disable Internet again. 

15. Mount the Neverwinter.Nights.2.Mysteries.Of.Westgate-CPY .ISO file. Install the game with the following serial key:
VQ31N-2FLQO-A81G7-2SXM8-BXH0A-HJACB-QL3K5
Dismount the .ISO and Auslogics. In case your wondering, This add-on won't install unless the base game has been patched to at least v1.22, and thus the patching beforehand. 

16. NEVER RUN THE UPDATER AGAIN!"
,bugnexus7,2011-04-27T08:28Z,"17. With Internet still DISCONNECTED, start the game. If your firewall asks, block/remember connections to the Internet.

18. Select ""Multiplayer"". Select ""New"". Either select a character, or create one. Start the game. 

At some point, the game asks you to login to the Online multiplayer service. Check the ""Remember Password"" option. Select ""Create an Account"".

19. Enter the following:
     Name: Bob
     Password: abcdefghij1
     Email: bob@bobmail.com
Enter...It will think for a bit, then let you through. 
Your firewall should ask for permission to allow a connection--This is very important--ALLOW it to connect to the TRUSTED zone (your network, and the one Hamachi will use), but BLOCK it from connecting to the Internet.

20. Once you have the firewall permissions set, close the game, Auslogics, then reboot your machine. "
,bugnexus7,2011-04-27T08:31Z,"21. Reconnect to the Internet. 

21.5 DO NOT USE CRACKS! If the game ever asks you to insert a disc (It may...) just run Daemon Tools and mount the .ISO it asks for. I'll only say this ONCE. 
CRACKS WILL BREAK THIS INSTALL. 

22. Play the game.

Multiplayer will work over a closed LAN, or through a VPN/Tunnel WAN such as Hamachi. When connecting/starting either, you will get a progress window that says ""Looking for Server..."", don't worry...the server it is looking for is the one the game just created on YOUR computer, NOT one of the public servers. Relax and it will start in a few moments.

ENJOY!

It will make entering all of the keys easier and you won't have to change windows constantly. Alt-tabbing doesn't help things go smoothly...
"
,bugnexus7,2011-04-27T23:46Z,"Verified fixed problems that others were having:

Character visible on creation screen.

Silver Shard is acknowledged by quest giver.

No black screening.

No Partial graphics tearing.

No texture failures (the white shit all over that some are seeing).

No errors (especially DirectX, or .NET).

So far as I can tell, everything works. I have played through the Silver Shard portion of the game in both single and Multiplayer."
,bugnexus7,2011-04-28T01:57Z,"Update:

Both Expansions definitely work. 

Toolset works, but needs to contact internet to work. Once it is running, firewall it to save modules.

Mysteries of Westgate still requires Online Authentication. The reason for this is the DRM requires an Install Counter Check. You can still  have the key in your registry and it will not work until it checks the Atari server for install counts the first time it runs.

You know what? Fuck 'em! Ossian's forums are FULL of people complaining of a broken game that they paid for. Boycott them until they drop the draconian DRM. THIS IS WHAT DRIVES POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS TO TORRENTS, OSSIAN! This exact shit. Fuck you. 

I recommend people just load up Community based modules instead of giving Ossian your money. 

Custom Content Modules work fine. "
,bugnexus7,2011-05-01T22:38Z,"As far as I can tell, the Mysteries of Westgate add-on removes the CD-check, and thus removes the need for any cracks. 

As a result, I recommend installing it and then using the uninstaller that comes with it to UNINSTALL just that add-on. If you use a program like Revo UnInstaller, make sure you leave the registry entries that MoW leaves behind intact. 

For those of you that don't know, the 2nd expansion ""Storm of Zehir"" is essentially a different game then the rest of NWN2. It combines aspects of the Baldur's Gate/Icewind Dale series of games, as well as a bit of MMO (You can play LAN/WAN with friends and their imported characters), Heroes of Might and Magic, and a bit of Ultima Online-style sandbox. 

Highly recommended and completely under-rated by the gaming community."
,bugnexus7,2011-05-06T12:51Z,"After numerous installs and testing...

Defrag your hard drive between/after installs...really, it makes a difference. Do NOT use any of the provided cracks, do NOT install XFire, do NOT let the installs patch until told to do so.

Install this Torrent...

Install this torrent...
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4520920/Neverwinter_Nights_2__Storm_of_Zehir-ViTALiTY

No serial key, just enter anything you wish.

After installing those three, run the Updater included with the game. This removes the CD check as well as massively updates all three games.

Don't bother with Mysteries of Westgate, it doesn't work without hours of registry alterations and quite simply isn't worth the effort.
