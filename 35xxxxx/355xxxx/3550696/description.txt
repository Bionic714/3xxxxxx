"The album includes 8 interchangeable CD covers by various artists, a spine cover that has an image of Vent with Model ZX disassembled, and a pinup featuring 1 modified CD cover, and on the back 4 others without the Capcom logo.

The booklet is, naturally, very japanese-text-heavy and doesn't include any full-page artwork.  However, amongst the text there are a few sketches in the background of Model ZX, Prairie, the three Operators, and what looks like two unused X models.  Also 3 pieces of art that were seen in-game in ZX."
