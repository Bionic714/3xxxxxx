I'm sorry, in MY country we use the kitchen sink to piss in. Its all about me you know....."
,nerull69,2006-11-11T10:43Z,"You piss in the sink where you live?   I like to go to parties and piss in other peoples sinks.  Sometimes their beds; depending on if I like them or not.  

If they are really special, I enjoy peeing in their shoes.  Nothing like watching someone try on a pair of soaking wet shoes, taking them off and feeling the wetness with their hand and finally bringing their hand up to their nose for a sniff.

Then if I am still there I like to yell and point at them and say ""Its piss!"""
