,jazmyne,2006-11-10T22:19Z,Thanks- I haven't had an opportunity to do this until the weekend. Sorry you're feeling put out that people aren't grateful. I really am!
,JimJonesLied,2006-11-11T05:37Z,"jazmyne, i'm getting the episodes from IRC, and i keep getting disconnected. It's taking me a lot of time to get them. So when I see that the previous two episodes were downloaded 13 times, and i personally had to do 10 of them, and at the time no one else is seeding, it upsets me. I see that some people are wising up though and seeding and I appreciate it. hopefully it keeps going, because that means that i can upload the new episodes faster since i have more bandwidth available. thanks for your comments and gratitude! i hope you enjoy."
