,AlbertE592,2006-11-13T21:07Z,As of the time of this comment - the latest version of limewire available (from the official UK Limewire web site) is 4.12.6 - THIS TORRENT IS A HOAX - PROBABLY A VIRUS - (((BE WARNED)))
,_Whoopy_,2006-11-13T21:10Z,"hmmm good that i havent opened it yet i wait for more comments then
thank you for the warning ;)"
,_Whoopy_,2006-11-13T21:26Z,"hmmm weird then, can it be that he just changed the name of it?
or has albert looked it up wrong? :S"
,MrxBirdman,2006-11-14T14:54Z,"guys this is not a virus or hoax if you dont believe me look at this pic:http://i109.photobucket.com/albums/n71/jack_assyrian/untitled.jpg

if you now still do not believe me go to limewires site it self www.limewire.com and then just click on basic download then underneath there it will say BETA LIMEWIRE, but that is the basic beta and not PRO 

so guys if you dont believe then dont download this torrent and fuk you, as i said thats it hard to get this shit and you dont apriciate it so really fuk you!"
,_Whoopy_,2006-11-14T17:03Z,"ok that cleared up everything, thank you for explaining and sry for not being sure of it

,AboBeX,2006-11-14T20:58Z,i dont think it is a virus but you should scan the file ...:P
,_Whoopy_,2006-11-14T22:21Z,"ugh....
MrxBirdman just explained how to check if its a real Limewire, after people started downloading no more complains and u say better check the file it may a virus?? -.- pfff....
aw well ur maybe right ;) always check TPB downloaded files:P"
,MrxBirdman,2006-11-15T15:34Z,"yes its tru, u are a user ther and not a uploader to be a uploader poeple will vote on you if they want you as a uploader that is anoying yes lol but that site is the best :D
everything you download will be done in seconds*!!:D

*depending on ur internetspeed lol 
what im trying to say is that ther are sites that the people on those sites have to seed back and if you dont you get banned thats how strict they are i download need for speed carbon ther done...... in a few hours not like here on piratebay lol"
,_Whoopy_,2006-11-15T16:17Z,"uhm can be true :P i may give it another try ;)
and uhm my inet speed is kinda low, the highest speed i ever had was 700kb ps
but that was on lan with my bro
and normal i dont get above 200kb ps
mostly its like 10 to 20 :S"
,Binky,2006-11-16T11:33Z,"Ok, this limewire is for real, but be warned! It hogs all *.torrent files to itself and changing *.torrent file association from the settings won't help! 
IT STILL FORCES LIMEWIRE TO USE TORRENT FILES!"
,MrxBirdman,2006-11-19T19:43Z,"to not make that happen delete limewire and install again but uncheck the box OPEN TORRENT FILES if that didnt help then just open ur torrent with ur bittorent creator if you got utorrent it ask you again then just click yes

thats it ;)"
,kingviper2,2006-11-20T19:57Z,"All you got to do to make limewire not to open turrents is to save the torrent not open it, and just right clic on it and open with but lord or what ever u use, lol"
,kingviper2,2006-11-20T19:58Z,"Few typos there, bit lord*  click*, lol"
,unresticed,2006-11-25T17:47Z,"I will hit n run!! ahahahaha ;P, Kiddin ;P."
,piratpasjon,2006-11-30T15:31Z,is limewire slow at downloading torrent files?
,Alpha_Slayer,2006-12-05T00:43Z,"For anyone who is stupid enough to think 4.13.0 is not real:
http://www.limewire.com/english/content/beta.shtml
Google, THEN warn! Google, THEN warn!"
,abhijit_net,2006-12-07T11:50Z,"This is real, and faster than older versions. I used to get 52KBps download speed with older versions, this one gives 100KBps. Although i get 135KBps to 200KBps with rapidshare and other websites. Atleast its 2 times faster than older Limewire Pro1.12.x versions. Also good for downloading torrents."

,s.b123,2006-12-28T03:03Z,"i cant turn off f/wall any ideas,i'm very new to this computer stuff can someone help please.
also to seed do i just leave the cleared torrent in the list"
,Wav3 CrackeR,2006-12-28T14:31Z,All versions of Limewire wants to install Java on your computer ... and thats where the frickin viruses and spywares comes from its not in the installer its the Java that ads virus on your computer .. when i installed it my anti virus got dicabled and my firewall was down .. then when i restarted the computer nothing worked. So dont install Java from Limewire files go to Javas website and download it there to be on the safe side or use dc++ or utorrent. :(
,lolle99,2007-01-26T19:50Z,"this is not a virus in this
this is NVAOS
(No Virus And Other Spyware)"
,lolle99,2007-02-03T10:42Z,"this works and it not a virus
sorry, my bad english"
,351c,2007-02-08T15:54Z,"hey just go to the sun Java website and get the latest version of java and then install this version. it's not a virus and it is the latest version out!

hey s.b123
what firewall are you using?? if it is windows go start button then click on control panel then windows firewall and in there click exceptions up the top and make sure limewire is ticked and anything else you want allowed"
,351c,2007-02-08T15:58Z,"MrxBirdman 
great upload
i love the idea how it now can do torrents and now i will have to see if it can compete with utorrent
