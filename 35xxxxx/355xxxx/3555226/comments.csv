And spread it...!"
,zver999,2006-11-11T08:50Z,bloody environmentalists... ffs give up this nonsense will ya!
,nerull69,2006-11-11T10:47Z,"Good flick.  Quite a bit over-exaggerated tho   
Sometimes to the point of being silly.

I pooped today...twice  ;)"
,Shinryuu_jp,2006-11-11T12:06Z,"@zver999: When is the time to take something like this serious. When it's too late? If this actually is happening it will have a great impact on the economy. The one thing every one is so happy about. 

@nerull69: Maybe it's a bit overexaggerated in a dramatical point of view. But the facts are nontheless very alarming. "
[V],sp1,2006-11-11T12:44Z,Those Jehovas Vitnesses also predict he end of the world all the time.. When is the time to take something like this serious. When it's too late?
,zver999,2006-11-11T12:53Z,"now put down the crackpipe and look around ya smelly hippie. the scientific community is in disagreement on this one. the planet has had wild temperature fluctuations during its life time. yeah we've all heard the fucking nostradamus: Y2K iz da end... never happened. economy? the alternative is to slap fat taxes on everything so the ones who can't affort stuff now will slip down further in misery. im rich, i work hard to earn the money to buy stuff and i'll take as many baths as i want... in fact i'll take one now hehe"
,Shinryuu_jp,2006-11-11T13:50Z,"@zver999: The scientific community is a part of this video, so I wouldn't agree with you on this one. But yes, the scientific community is in disagreement in how great impact this will render the earth. 
The earth resources aren't endless. I think both of us can agree on this one. And the fact that half of the number of human beings that ever walked the earth is living now, should tell something about that not everyone are able to live as luxuary as you do. "
,zver999,2006-11-11T14:26Z,"the planet's resources are finite - check. i'm fortunate to live in a first world country - check. humanity is fucking with mother nature - double check. so what's your point? mine: live today, don't give up your way of life. for all i know WW3 might happen long before the nature collapses, or aliens kill us all, or rabid squrrels rebel in the woods or whatever. don't give up your way of life. consume, consume and consume or the world as we know it will collapse and we all will be in deep shit... amen!"
,Shinryuu_jp,2006-11-11T14:58Z,"My point is, it's an egoistic way of life. We all depend on each other. Some have resources that we don't have in our area of the world. But that doesn't mean we can take advantage of them becasue they are weaker. 
If we exploit the earth. What do we leave our children and grand children. A lot has happened in this century. I don't see any good reason why we should lead a careless life. If there is a potential problem. Shouldn't we deal with it? Wether it is an enviromental problem or an upcoming WW3. "
,zver999,2006-11-11T16:02Z,"egoistic way of life, perhaps. i'd rather call it pragmatic tho. ya see: the world is like a big fucking train going 2000mph. you can go out and demonstrate and wave flags and it'll just keep on coming. it takes generations to turn the mofo around. changing the world aint trivial. overfishing, well ban fishing then. eh, right, but who will feed the now unemployed fishermens' families. too much fucking CO2, ez, well let's just tax the crap outta ppl. wonderful, but now the prices on everything are skyhi - things don't just magically fly themselves across the atlantic, they have to be transported. keep on FUDin' hippies, i say live the life and try to find rational ways to solve our problems..."
[V],pryll,2006-11-11T19:59Z,"IÂ´m surprised to find that there is actually people around who are still waiting for the scientific community to agree on anything. Thats not their function- their function is to create theories that are created to be falsefied. If anyone outthere is waiting for science to present ""The Truth"", youÂ´ll have to wait. Good Luck."
,b-mojo,2006-11-11T22:04Z,the scientific community does not disagree the global warmening will have a great impact on the planet. Infact they all agree that it will.
,hdtom,2006-11-12T21:25Z,"well, what about part 2 - 4 then?
thx"
,Shinryuu_jp,2006-11-12T23:56Z,"They will come, 
Wait until next thursday. "

,Echo06,2007-09-02T13:25Z,Very mature of ya'all to go bashing environmentalists. Go fuck yourselves you ignorant bastards. Don't care about any one else than yourselves then.. but don't come wining when the climate go nuts..
