,Madox,2006-11-15T17:04Z,"no, this is real i think it's the crack to Vista final version, i have seen many simular torrents like this..."
,figure004,2006-11-15T18:02Z,fake my ass.
[V],Albacken,2006-11-15T19:00Z,"How can you say this is fake, Come down lessen and maybe you learn something new"
,figure004,2006-11-15T19:14Z,"hope I was helpful with seeding. I seeded from 12:30am to 9am... so I've stopped for now since there are plenty of seeders, if not, lemme know and I'll resume seeding."
,roma0803,2006-11-16T00:52Z,Doesn't work!!
,figure004,2006-11-16T21:36Z,"if it doesn't work than you guys are complete retards. Myself and everyone else spent over 10 hours testing this shit before release. This is only tested with the ""BillGates"" vista release."
,figure004,2006-11-16T21:36Z,"P.S. For 32bit Vista, not tested in x64."
,roma0803,2006-11-17T11:42Z,"DOES work. Indeed needed the BillGates release. My wrong, sorry figure004. 

Btw. Make sure u own the original file by modifying the security props. U CAN do it in normal mode and reboot after replacing the file. Watermark is gone."
,PapaDocta,2006-11-19T13:34Z,"why a watermark remover for the final vista?!!? isn't the final release shouldn't have an watermarks ???

damn"
,Fat64,2006-11-21T23:09Z,":) you still end up with the watermark , I use a BETA key so that's probably why. Gahh I have problems though, cannot write the file mentioned because ""Some program is using the file"" :R"
