,1117954,2008-03-02T16:47Z,Hmm...language? English? El other? Curious...
,Rohen,2009-03-19T01:01Z,Much appreciated... my brother has been looking for it.  Thanks.
,goosoid,2009-04-16T13:19Z,"The movies called ""Tokyo Zombie"", guess what language it is in.  If you are American, here is a clue, Tokyo is in Japan.

Does this have English subs?  I hope it is not a dubbed version.  They are a crime against humanity."

lol @ u wapanese!"
,Dakenz,2009-06-17T05:27Z,"@goosoid my your smart, oh wait, nope, your actually an asshole. Sure Tokyo Zombie sounds like it is in Japanese( or is it Tokyanese?), but then by that logic Big Trouble in Little China could be in Chinese. And isn't it funny that you really did not answer his question, you just felt the need to be a twat, and even better you still asked the same fucking question didn't you? as you say ""Does this have English subs? I hope it is not a dubbed version. They are a crime against humanity."" what the fuck is diff from what 1117954 asked? not much, except that he did it simply you had to do it all full retard-like.  The only crime against humanity here is that your still allowed to use our good air."
,sumosmurf,2009-06-30T22:24Z,You never go full retard.
,sumosmurf,2009-06-30T22:26Z,Look what took me a whole 5 seconds to find by downloading the nfo. Language .........: Japanese Subtitles ........: English
,sumosmurf,2009-06-30T22:29Z,"It's amazing how many retards download torrents not knowing what the hell they're doing or how to find the information they want. Someone should write a book titled ""The Complete Fucktards Guide To Torrents""."
,JohnathonMacHaim,2010-02-15T03:10Z,Seconded
,JohnathonMacHaim,2010-02-15T03:14Z,Maybe a sub-section in the Anarchists Cookbook?
,w33n,2010-02-19T23:06Z,"I fucking lol'd.

Thanks for telling us, Smurf."
,zippyderppyguy,2011-01-05T14:20Z,"There are indeed a lot of retards here, mostly the ones calling anybody who asks a question a retard. See, this is a torrent, if the spoken language of the content is not listed, than people have no way of knowing the language of said content. 

so calling a person a retard for asking only betrays your own n00berism and shows us that suffer from random rage attacks. It doesn't make you look smart, look cool, look sexy are any of those things you think it makes you appear to be.

For the ones asking. The DVD itself has ENGLISH DD 5.1 AND JAPANESE DD 2.0.. As for this torrent, I have no clue as their is not a whole lot of info post and the links are to those torrent sites that you just can't trust.... So, I say downlaod it, thank the provider and let us know what the out come is before the hate machine rolls up in here and floods out the file info with fucking memes and internet slang."
,fusa88,2011-07-30T17:06Z,"@Dakenz you stupid moron 
""Sure Tokyo Zombie sounds like it is in Japanese( or is it Tokyanese?)""
tokyo is the capital of japan and if you have normal working brains you would know that "
,jinmi,2012-06-15T00:00Z,"@goosoid
I can not figure out why people hate when a movie is dubbed.
Only way I can figure a to keep the artistic prospective of the artiest that made the movie would be to read the movie in the language it was made in too. 
Here's the thing about most subbed movies  are fan made unless the movie was from a DVD.
Even with that said most of the time the translation is not perfect so in a way your all ways losing out one way or another.

I guess losing the focus of whats going on in the movie reading and hearing the actors real voices talking in gibberish is fine too.

Going full retard now!!!!!"
