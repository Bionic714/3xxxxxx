sigsagsug and salzhaus present ?snowbored??. our brand new movie is about to have its world premiere! on october 21st we want you to come to the cityhalle in winterthur, switzerland, where a very very special event is waiting for you. This movie is about to show that all the waiting for the perfect day is worth it and that it is even possible to have tons of fun on downdays. Riders like Markus Keller, Gian Simmen, Danny Kass, Stephan Maurer, Jon Cartwright, Christian Haller, Reto Kestenholz and many others show their skills in every terrain you could imagine and will make you long for the next season! ?Snowbored?? is neither a conventional ?part? movie nor a documentation. It?s the attempt to create a whole new movie concept based on different themes like park, powder, woods, rails as well as some other special features?
