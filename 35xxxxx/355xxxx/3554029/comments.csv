[T],TeamPS,2009-04-07T01:22Z,"thx...

and to the n00bs:

keygens/cracks/patches and such generate code to crack your apps. so AV's detect it as a trojan. if you seriously don't know that then you shouldn't download stuff like this...."
,SanzeeBoy,2009-07-04T12:42Z,"Despite the countless number of false virus reports left in this world by the newbiest of noobs, one cannot help but look down upon them and chuckle. They do not know what they're doing, and that is what makes them special. You cannot blame them. I don't blame them. They obey their anti-virus software without question. It's only natural. Though they speak as if retarded, they remain completely innocent. Their innocence is retarded too you see. That's what makes this whole thing fun as hell to watch. Retarded retards. What a great world."
