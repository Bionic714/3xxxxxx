The Level 1 course allows you to learn an extensive vocabulary and basic grammar in just 10-12 hours - about 3 times faster than you would take using conventional learning methods!! This will enable you to communicate effectively in Spanish (European) in EMERGENCIES, at the RESTAURANT, at the HOTEL, at WORK etc etc.

Levels 2, 3 and 4 courses extend your learning using exactly the same approach, so by the time you finish you will be able to read and understand the average newspaper, and speak and understand Spanish (European) in a very wide range of situations.

The courses are ideal for travel, for business and for schoolwork, since the whole course uses all the major grammar points you need for effective communication, including all major grammar points for GCSE.
