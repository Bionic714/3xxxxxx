,p2P2p,2006-11-25T05:42Z,"Everything you do online is monitored - so what? Downloaded 700+ times... that's the important bit - it shows people aren't scared to look at information for themselves and make up their own minds. I hope you enjoy this documentary, it is quite a good watch. I will repeat my comments here:

""Interesting also to note the shocking use of faked photographs and other media portrayed in this film, showing how interrogators will happily use forged materials to try to get detainees to admit they are terrorists or to blackmail them into going to work for the intelligence services.

Many hundreds of thousands of people worldwide have called for the Guantanamo Bay prison facility to be closed, many politicians including Presidents and Prime Ministers have concluded that it should close. Now close it."""

Heres another thought to ponder.. How about not not visiting countries at war because you're ""curious"".

What a completely out of the ordinary and incredibly stupid thing to do. Lets do a docudrama about it.

Im not sure this is going to work in anyones favor to generate sympathy or propaganda... my screensaver is more exciting..."

Total stupidity on the part of these british muslims, not like its not been constanly in the news over here, they knew the risks allright, so why did they go. Load of crap this if you ask me."

,Hixdog69,2008-06-01T21:31Z,"Lonewulf - You are an idiot

Irrespective of war zone or not war zone - there is something that protects you everyday in your country. 

HUMAN RIGHTS.

Since when does holding UK citizens against their will without trail or legal consort adhere to them.

I assume from your stupid comments about Buddhists not receiving the same treatment, that you don`t see the OBVIOUS. Which Buddhist countrys have Oil???? Burma? Thailand?

Oh......thats right its the Muslim countrys (which the West has been meddling with for the past century) which have it all.

War and oil fuel the economy of the UK and the USA. Sadly it is the way the 21st century world works. 

Read some decent literature and stop wasting your and OTHER PEOPLES time writing shit on forums.

Thanks for the up p2P2p."
,SkatingBella,2008-06-05T13:24Z,"what the fuck people?
comment on the quality of the movie not on America's mistakes (and yes, i am american).. 

thanks for the upload p2P2p, great stuff, excellent!"
,C_Rex,2009-06-20T23:05Z,"I agree with Lonewolf on this one.  If you go somewhere that sucks, don't expect to be treated well when you get there.  While not everyone in Gitmo has as much of a reason to be there, there are some hardened terrorists in there, and there's no reason we should let them out, especially just dumping them in the U.S., like the plan is going now.

Hixdog69, human rights are diminishing as we speak.  People who don't agree with the current administration are coming under attack.  The government is violating citizens rights left and right every day.  Muslim countries don't have all the oil, actually countries like Russia and Venezuela are very oil rich, and we're not attacking them.  Either way, that's irrelevant, as attacking someone who's supplying you with something is generally a good way to make the price of that something go up, much as it did.  How we got more oil, or cheaper oil, out of that, I have no idea."
