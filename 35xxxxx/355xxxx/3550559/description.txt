trivia from imdb:

\\\"Despite initial fears of an R18 certificate (preventing the film from being shown publicly and therefore ruling out its initial premiere at London\\\'s Tate Modern) the film was passed completely uncut and granted an 18 certificate by the BBFC. The BBFC president Sir Quentin Thomas said that the film was \\\"so explicit that it would normally attract an R18 rating\\\" but he judged that \\\"it was a work of art not intended to arouse\\\". All UK DVD releases carry a warning which states that the film \\\'contains strong, real sex\\\'.\\\"
