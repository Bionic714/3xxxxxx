,shagster,2006-11-17T06:09Z,hi can any1 explain y on azurues i cant upload quciker than 30kb/s when my limit is 100kb/s i have a 2mb connection my other torrents are stopped settings are good is it just azureus or is there something else i should know about please inform me if you know how to sort the problem out as i would like to share at my limits. thank you
,shagster,2006-11-21T08:36Z,"ok what part of seed dont you mother fuckers understand take take fucking take and it really pisses me off to the point that i feel like killing the torrent. i made 5 peeps download this alot quicker than the rest thinking atleast 2 of the 5 would seed with me for abit but oh noooo its to much hard work leaving ya comp running to seed for abit stupid mother fuckers. i just hope when more peeps finish downloading that they gonna seed and to you 5 that have not i hope u get cancer and die.


to every1 else i seed everynight 12am till 9pm somtimes 11pm till 9pm my limit seems to be 30-40kb/s on my 2mb connection which sucks balls cos if i could id upload at a much higher rate. if u use shareaza i can upload at 300kb/s download at 1.2mb/s with azureus max download seems to be 200kb/s and upload on 30-40kbs if any1 knows if i need to do something please let me know.thankssssss"
