,Friberg91,2006-11-16T22:12Z,39 gib....it would take a year for me to download...LOOOL
,BritneysOrifice,2006-11-16T22:55Z,"SupplyGiver: whoa!  Are you seriously going to seed this?  It would be fantastic to get this whole set.  Let us know, mang."
,DarkPilot,2006-11-16T23:50Z,Only Entire World ? Please? :)
,SupplyGiver,2006-11-16T23:58Z,"Yes I am going to seed this.  I have wanted X-Plane for some time now, and could never find the entire set on the internet.  So, I bought it and now I'm seeding it.  ULing at 60k/s is going to take a while, but thats how these things go.

-=[SupplyGiver]=-"
,SupplyGiver,2006-11-17T00:32Z,Make sure to be connected on Friday night at midnight EST.  I will be seeding from a 1.2MB/s source.
,BritneysOrifice,2006-11-17T00:39Z,"SupplyGiver: much, much obliged for this. And I'll definitely be connected on Friday.  Thanks again for the heads-up!"
,uull,2006-11-17T08:20Z,Thank's so much!
,BlueBlood_gz,2006-11-17T19:31Z,"When u bought it? If it's just happen, should be V8.5......"
,caruso2006,2006-11-17T23:44Z,"Thanks a LOT for this.

I hope we can keep the torrent alive for some time, it's really worth it...I'll seed as much as I can."
,SupplyGiver,2006-11-18T03:08Z,"If you want v8.50, then download this...  Install the X-Plane 8.40 Disc, then update with the 1.5MB patch off the site (http://www.X-Plane.com), then install the rest of the discs.  There are no other Full-Set X-Plane torrents, so be thankfull of what you are getting.  Geez..."
,SupplyGiver,2006-11-18T03:23Z,"BTW, I opened 30 slots and I am averagivg 800KB/s so the torrent is going pretty fast... The Ohio State vs. Michigan game is tomorrow... GO BUCKS!!!"
,likefilm,2006-11-18T16:15Z,"Great upload! Thank u!!!  It is a big job for me to download it! 
"
,whityini,2006-11-20T13:17Z,Thanks a lot for this but is it possible to have only Europe DVD uploaded?
,SupplyGiver,2006-11-20T22:27Z,"While I would appreciate the entire thing be downloaded and seeded, it is possible to get only the Europe DVD.  In you app (uTorrent/Azureus or whatever) you can tell it which ones to skip/not download."
,mike123,2006-11-24T01:20Z,"SupplyGiver, you are a legend!

I have been scouring the P2P networks for this. For reasone which are difficult to explain, it is impossible for me to order these disks. You are a savior!

For anyone who doesn't know what X-Plane is, it is probably the best flight simulator available. It craps on the MicroSucks product (from a great height).

I'll do my best to keep what I have uploading at a good speed, too.

YeeHoo!!!!"
,krapduude,2006-11-24T02:36Z,"Once you install the game, how big is it then? Im not sure i can install it without removing all the other games ive got installed :P nice upload thanks mate"
,mike123,2006-11-24T04:39Z,"I think the global scenery alone unpacks to about 60Gig, then you'll need a bit more for the prog and its generic scenery.
Remember that you can use your torrent client to select which images to download - you shouldn't have to download them all unless you have a lousy client. "
,jimmsu,2006-11-24T14:39Z,"am taking it also

but see only 64% "
,krapduude,2006-11-25T03:37Z,well I want to download it all ^^ thanks for the info. 
,caruso2006,2006-11-25T10:28Z,"SupplyGiver:

I think we need your help:torrent's been stuck at 64% for 2 days.

Thanks a lot"
,SupplyGiver,2006-11-26T06:57Z,"I apologize everybody, I have a Gen 1 Dell XPS Laptop (which is notorious for heat problems) and it recently (again) overheated and burnt out the power addapter.  Dell is sending me a new Gen 2 laptop for the crap this one has put me through.  Anyways, my comp has been on the fritz and I was unable to seed.  I am sorry for the delay, but am now back up and running.

-=[PeaceOut]=-"
,SupplyGiver,2006-11-26T11:24Z,"100% of the torrent has been fully uploaded.  It is all out there.  I will continue seeding, but seeds should start becoming abundant soon..."
,poogen1,2006-11-26T11:40Z,"Thank you very much Supply Giver
I'm really happy with your effort to
upload this huge program, but what I
can see there is nobody that has got
more than 75% yet.
"
,SupplyGiver,2006-11-26T13:43Z,"Well, thanks for the suggestion of such a status aluanda.

As for poogen1, I have uploaded 100% of the data to many different people.  The 75% that you are seeing is the people you are connected to.  It is not including the data of the people you are not connected to or the people whom are not  currently active on the torrent...  The point was that in one way or another, you will have all your data shortly (hopefully within the next day)

,jimmsu,2006-11-28T14:35Z,"SupplyGiver: 

this is the bigest download i have done with a torrent


I think we need your help:torrent's been stuck at 92,2% 

am conected to 122 people but dont come any further
see also alot of others stuck at 92,2%


Thanks a lot
"
,SupplyGiver,2006-11-29T00:54Z,"Guys, I'm not sure whats going on here... I have uploaded 5GB over the initial seed.  And only 92.2% is registering.  I am going to seed from another computer and see if anything changes.  Thanks for hanging in there guys.  Sorry for the delay and such."
,SupplyGiver,2006-11-29T22:35Z,"The first person to download doesn't seed...  Now I'm pissed.  To enlighten you people on how these things work, you need to have seeders in order to get the data in a timely fashion.  Without seeders, there will be a certain amount of data that will take FOREVER to get to the leachers.  If you aren't going to seed, DON'T BOTHER DOWNLOADING."
,poogen1,2006-11-29T23:49Z,"Hang in there. I'm on 98.2 and I will sead
as soon  as I have a full copy"
,mike123,2006-11-30T02:14Z,"I've got 100% of Australia, 100% of Asia and 100% of the program image, and am uploading all three (of course). Other images are still coming.

Asia looks really great, but am having a little trouble with Aus. Maybe I need to delete my existing custom scenery - or reinstall everything (as my existing installation is now a bit confused).

Again, great work, SupplyGiver!"
,poogen1,2006-11-30T09:06Z,"Well you made it SupplyGiver. It was a long
journey but now yo're off the hook.
Many thanks again."
,jimmsu,2006-11-30T09:13Z,"SupplyGiver: 

thank you for the last help

got it now at 100% and seeding

Many thanks again."
,SupplyGiver,2006-11-30T15:56Z,w00t!  2 weeks of seeding finally over!
,SupplyGiver,2006-11-30T16:20Z,A special thanks to you other who are also seeding too.  Thank You!
,caruso2006,2006-11-30T16:48Z,"@SupplyGiver

Thanks A LOT!

One last question:is it possible to burn evreything(including the scenery) and to run it from the dvd?

Thanks again, I will seed as often as I can"
,SupplyGiver,2006-11-30T18:11Z,"Sure you can burn it, but you are going to need Dual-Layer DVD-R's for 5 of the DVD's."
,caruso2006,2006-11-30T19:32Z,"Good thing to know...

You probably won the biggest-torrent-ever contest(don't know whether there's a prize for it...lol)

Thx again"
,rancormac,2006-12-01T07:14Z,"I'm on a mac... Do the .MDF files be placed somewhere, or need to be mounted and installed?
Thanks"
,c310,2006-12-01T13:34Z,Took me 11 days to download this but eventually done. Thanx. Will keep on seeding for a long while still!
,SupplyGiver,2006-12-01T16:54Z,".MDF in an Alcohol 120% image file, so you either need to mount or burn it.  I'm not a Mac fanatic, so I don't know what programs are available for you."
,wowofwarcraft,2006-12-03T11:46Z,tell me please with what speed is downloadig this??
,caruso2006,2006-12-04T14:13Z,"...Anyone knows where to find the cover?


Thx"
,buffybill,2006-12-05T05:43Z,"Just one queerie on this torrent.
Could some one who has already grabbed this tell me, Is the [b]scenery[/b] version 7 or version 8 ?
Thanks"
,mike123,2006-12-06T04:52Z,V8 :-) 
,SupplyGiver,2006-12-06T17:54Z,"There is no cover.  The DVD's came in sleves.  No Box.  Rather upsetting, but the product is what counts most.  I could scan the DVD's if you really want me too."
,buffybill,2006-12-06T18:38Z,"Thanks for the reponse mike, and thank you loads for releasing this torrent SupplyGiver. My hat goes out to you good sir.  No need to scan the dvds on my behalf but thanks all the same.
 I had read that the ver.8 scenery was quite an improvent over 7, so yet again well done to you sir on a FANTASTIC release.
 Now for the patience testing part....grabbing it :P

,buffybill,2006-12-06T18:51Z,"lol just realised the reponse to covers wasnt on my behalf. duh! But hey thanks anyway heheh.

You know, I've been around on the ""scene"" for a very long time and having just noticed you only have a 60k up speed, once again I commend you. I put this release and ur dedication to it, up there with some of the best I haven't seen for many a moon ;)

,Rigan,2007-01-04T21:15Z,"Just a small tip if someone is experianceing
install problem (like one small file is missing)
1. open up bitlord for example
2. ceck the file and priority list
3. rightclick on the file that is not fully compleated
4. inactivate it
5. activate it again and *poff* problem solved when it has downloaded it fully

can anybody partition the files and re-post the torrent?"

,SupplyGiver,2007-01-17T19:44Z,"It's been a while since I posted this, but I would just like to add that if you intend to burn these discs on non-dual layer, you can mount the disc, and re-image them with Alcohol 120% - setting the max image size to 4GB. then burn the image files.  You all probably knew that, but just in case...

I will be getting one of those nifty Bittorrent enabled NAS's once the Firmware issues get settled, and be seeding from it instead of my new laptop.

,SupplyGiver,2007-01-19T01:30Z,"For the FAT32 problem, create a secondary partition on the drive, and make it NTFS (Partion Magic is my Fav.)

I have tried sevral air ports in europe, with the same result. Other than that, it looks like a great game :) Please help!! :)"
,SupplyGiver,2007-03-23T00:22Z,"If all you are getting is water, you don't have the scenery files installed correctly or at all.  Make sure the location that you are at is in the an area that you have installed.  Mine defaults to USA, so if I only have Europe installed, then I would start off in water, but would need to locate myself to Europe where there is in fact land mass loaded.

In your case, I'm not sure.  Your post was like a month ago, so you probably have it figured out by now.  Please post the solution if youo find it :-)
