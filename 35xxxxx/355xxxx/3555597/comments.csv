,Salamifever,2006-11-11T21:05Z,is this the anachists cookbook or something other?
,ion_2004,2006-11-12T06:24Z,"this is an awfully small file...i doubt it is worth messing with.  The anarchy Cookbook is on here somewhere, but i had to get the whole 700mb collection to get it.  Not worth much either becasue it was so outta date, but  very interesting to read.  I might post something worth a damn soon.."
,LucisFerens,2006-11-13T02:11Z,"this is NOT the anarchist cookbook, this is better.
(the cookbook is a joke, this is real working stuff)
the file is small because it's somple text file, not a .pdf, but there is some intresting info inside"
,MCMJ,2006-11-13T23:19Z,holy shit is this the one Osama Bin laden gives out to the Taliban.. fuck yea.. let us use it on them
,000101000dude,2008-10-16T21:04Z,"The Anarchists Cookbook is out of date but there's still a ton of interesting info in that big collection. As far as this file is concerned, I want it but I'm going to wait until more seeders are available (Probably not going to happen - everyone is ""terrified"" to come near this file, I bet.)"
