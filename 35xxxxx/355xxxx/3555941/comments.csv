,printempsdavril,2008-04-10T04:58Z,"I recommend this very big film. It is one Big Film of the History of the Cinema. It criminal affair took place before the Second World War in France (but the movie was shooting during the war under NAZI Occupation). 
Henri-George CLOUZOT is one of better French directors. There was remakes of his works, but never the same quality as originals, as "" The Devilish (Les DIABOLIQUES)"" or "" The Salary of the Fear (Le SALAIRE de la PEUR)"". 
Look at originals, they are better!!!! 
Good Film!"
