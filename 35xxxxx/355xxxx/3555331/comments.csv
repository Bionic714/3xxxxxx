You can download 6.10 directly from www.ubuntu.com at high speed"
,LucisFerens,2006-11-11T21:15Z,"right
I was here to tell the same thing: Ubuntu 6.10 is out. http://ubuntu.com
A REALLY GOOD opearting system, very easy to install and use, perfect for those who are thinking about trying linux for the first time.
Also good for more experienced users: Ubuntu is basically like Debian, with one major difference: it works."
