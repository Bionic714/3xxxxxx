,tokkep,2006-11-08T20:44Z,I can´t unpack mmc.rar??
,friendly,2006-11-08T22:30Z,"Have a SE p990i.
I have placed all folder on my memory sticks rooth and placed the crack file in the rooth. And the started the .sis file. Everything looks ok. It installs everything and then asks if the application should start. I pres yes. After 3 seconds it says it is not possible to start the program...   :-(

I have redone the routine, same results.

Any advice?"

If you get a ""Certificate Expired"" error just change your system date back to 2006 sometime and it will install then
