,vinylking,2006-11-11T00:22Z,"It's a audioformat, like mp3, wma and others, with the big difference- it's totally lossless. You pack it with flac and when you unpack it back to WAV you have lost nothing. With mp3 192 kbps you lose about 90% of the information.
DonĂ¤t know if it works with itune-don't think so, but you can use for instance Nero with plugins for flac or Easy CD DA-extractor and convert it to any other format you like!"
,diksor,2006-11-14T12:11Z,"thanks vinylking, so the way to go is to convert to win-blows, hah? all the goodies don't seem to work with mac. what is the player so that I can actually listen to it? Nero? as you can tell, a newbie here."
,vinylking,2006-11-15T10:11Z,"I don-t know how to listen to it wit a Mac. But if you download easy cd da creator, you can find it here in TPB, you can convert the flac-format to any format you like, mp3, WAV or so, and then you can listen to it it the player-progam, whatever it's called in your Mac, (or buy a PC...:-)"
