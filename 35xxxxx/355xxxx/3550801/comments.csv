,cambridge court,2006-11-04T04:03Z,dont get all pissy about what section it is in it is good quality for what it is very veiwable and enjoyable sit down with your family and get off the computer for once and a enjoy a movie.
,Hulla Bulla Girl,2006-11-04T05:35Z,"Its a dvd, because he made it a dvd. So its in the right section, and as he writes, the bitrate for the movies is 700 and sound is 64 kbs. 
A normal dvd has the bitrate around 4000 when its on a dvd5.
My point is that the quality is something like a xvid movie, but now there 8 of them on a dvd you can view at you dvdplayer!"
