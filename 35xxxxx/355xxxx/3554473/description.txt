Rick Springfield started playing piano at age 9. He began playing the guitar at age 13, and writing songs at 14. In 1967, Springfield dropped out of high school to begin his professional music career. His first appearance in a band was as a singer/guitarist in the band Rock House. In 1968, the band changed the name to MPD, Ltd, then embarked on a tour of Vietnam to entertain the troops stationed there.

In 1981, Springfield returned to music with the album Working Class Dog. Most notably on this album were the smash hit singles, "Jessie's Girl" and "I've Done Everything for You", the latter written by Sammy Hagar.

Springfield won a Grammy in 1981 for Best Male Rock Vocal Performance for "Jessie's Girl". Springfield was also nominated for two Grammys in 1982 and one Grammy in 1983.

His subsequent release in 1982, Success Hasn't Spoiled Me Yet, also contained a string of top 40 hits, including "Don't Talk To Strangers" and the soft ballad "What Kind of Fool Am I?"

His 1983 release, Living in Oz, contained more serious subject matter, a more hard-rock sound, and more technological sound. The album went platinum on the strength of the hits "Human Touch", "Souls", and "Affair of the Heart". His 1984 single "Love Somebody" (from the album Hard to Hold) was his last top ten hit in the U.S.

Springfield was one of several performers who participated in the Live Aid charity concert. After releasing the album "Tao" in 1985, Springfield chose to take a break from recording to spend more time with his family, and to deal with the depression that had affected him since his adolescence.

In 1987, Springfield returned to the studio and released the album "Rock of Life". The next year, he was seriously injured in an ATV accident. Since he was unable to play the guitar for six months, the planned tour to promote his album was cancelled. It would be nearly a decade before Springfield would return to the studio to record the albums Sahara Snow (1997) and Karma.(1999).

In 2005, Springfield released his latest album, The Day After Yesterday with his favourite cover versions.

In 1974, Springfield dated and lived with then 15 year old actress Linda Blair. He considered it his first "grown up" relationship, despite nearly 10 years difference in their ages. [6][7]

In September, 2000, Springfield was arrested for alleged spousal abuse. He spent one evening in jail and was released the next morning on $50,000 bail. He was never convicted, and charges were dropped. Later, Springfield and his wife issued a joint statement to the press saying that they are happily married and will continue to raise their children together [8]

In 2006, after nearly 34 years of residing in the United States, Springfield became an American citizen. He still retains Australian citizenship as well.
