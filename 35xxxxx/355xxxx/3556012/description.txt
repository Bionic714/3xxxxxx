Description: This French documentary chronicles a sobering and little known event that occurred during the Battle of Okinawa, the final bloody man-to-man struggle between American and Japanese troops before the A-bombs were dropped. The event is framed by the story of a woman in the process of creating a computer program about the tragic event in which Japanese soldiers and officers killed their own families and then themselves en masse in hopes of frightening the American troops with the shock of it all. Unfortunately, the horrific gambit failed; the Americans misunderstood and this made it easier for them to justify using the bomb.
-AMG Review

The quality is quite bad but this is ultra-rare and there is no DVD or other rip available.
