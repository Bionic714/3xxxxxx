,Mr Googles,2006-11-05T21:31Z,"
What a great PC game!"
[T],stevekasian,2006-11-05T21:56Z,"Mr Googles: It's a utility for FLIGHT SIMULATOR, dorkus - if it were posted anywhere else, nobody would find it."
,framitz,2006-11-05T22:15Z,Pure crap folks.  Just visit the web site for the product to see for your self.
,allen_x,2006-11-06T00:43Z,"thanks, the difference is noticeable"
,McPorra,2006-11-06T02:01Z,"Gentlemen, this is pure gold. Believe me. I've tested them both for 3 days and I'm sure FS is running faster than before. Don't just say it's crap if you haven't tried it. And with such a fast answer, I'm sure you didn't even read enough about these utilities. I'd like to here some comments from those who gave it a try. Good day to all. "
,allen_x,2006-11-06T02:22Z,nice speech there 
,rrodger99,2006-11-06T02:37Z,"I use OO defrag found from a forum to speed up the megascenery....if you move all the megascenery int a file named ohhhh say A_Megacity dallas & then put that folder on the root of the install drive rather than buried in the fs9 folder & then defrag by name.

This places the megascenery folders on the outer edges of the platter & really cuts the load time & the reaction time in game.

This little tip will work with any scenery.Just make sure you delete the old location from the scenery library & manually add the new location."
,WinnieXL,2006-11-06T02:47Z,Wat also speeds up the load times: one oss disk WD360ADFD for system and 2 in raid striped WD740GD (ADFD is better of corse)
,WinnieXL,2006-11-06T02:48Z,on the 2 striped disk you install as first fs9 
[T],stevekasian,2006-11-06T04:01Z,"Thanks for the tips guys. I'll have to try it, as scenery tile load/access times seem to be my only bottleneck.

McPorra: Glad you have luck with it. I've heard others have had luck also, but FYI, I've tried all versions of SystemBoosterXP, with all different amounts of RAM, and every single time I use it it majorly slows my system down and makes FS sceneries load about less than 1/2 as fast as they usually do. As far as I'm concerned, for me & mys system, it's little more than snake oil. It tends to give varying results to varying extreems on different systems."

FS2004 FDC Live Cockpit With Working Serial"
,McPorra,2006-11-06T11:32Z,"Good to hear from you, guys. 
rrodger99: I was an O&O defrag user myself until I discovered Ultimate Defrag. Your technique for loading your favorite scenery is perfect but you can also achieve that with Ultimate Defrag without having to rename the scenery folder. Just go to Tools > Options > Select drive > High Performance > Select folders and place them on top of the selection. Then defrag using Folder/File name method. Very simple. 
stevekasian: This is how I take advantage of SystemBoosterXP for FS: Create a New profile (Call it FS2004) > Select folders like sceneries and textures you use most (your favorite aircraft and scenery textures). Then just switch SystemBooster to the FS2004 profile, before you load FS. 
The right usage of these 2 tools combined, will make your FS run faster. 
Good luck to all. "
[T],stevekasian,2006-11-06T13:03Z,"Thanks McPorra... Unfortunately, I tried every possible variation - spent all sorts of time reading up on it, etc... still nothing but a disaster 4 me. Better luck 2 others."
,Psykomanius,2006-11-06T14:02Z,"What is the good options for a Gaming Computer ?
There are sooo many options here in Ultimate Defrag :-S"
,Psykomanius,2006-11-06T14:04Z,"I have Windows XP on drive 1.
And all my games on drive 2.
And all backup files on drive 3."
,McPorra,2006-11-06T15:43Z,"Psykomanius: Please, check the Help file > Which Defrag Method To Use. It's all there. "
