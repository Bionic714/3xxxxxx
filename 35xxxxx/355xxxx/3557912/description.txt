                 :: notes ::

                 Respect to both FoA and Efterlyst for releasing this on PAL
                 earlier. Anyway, this is the 2 disc version, with both DTS
                 and DolbyDigital soundtracks. Also 2 disc versions means
                 higher bitrate, better quality. As a bonus, you get more
                 subs =). 

                 All extras was removed (it was alot), directors commentary
                 sound and subs removed.

                 We hope you like this 2disc nordic release. Have fun!
