I used Waves plugins and Cubase to process everything in 32-bit file format (dual-bit 48-bit processing).  I used Waves X-Hum to remove any DC offset before processing, then used Waves proprietary L2 plugin after processing to re-quantize back down to 16-bit.

I also had to re-create the cover, 'causethe old one was almost non-existant.

Thanx!"
