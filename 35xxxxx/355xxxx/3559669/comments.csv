,belga1,2006-11-18T05:26Z,"Thank's ...
Just a additional comment: dunno the reason..but why you don't compress the files (ZIP or RAR)..it will be some help for the two side as it's will be smallest size to seed and D/L.
Just a tought..."
,djsiryn,2006-11-18T05:39Z,"I tried but the torrent program I am using for some reason wont except them into torent files.
SORRY"

,djsiryn,2006-11-18T09:56Z,"yeah sorry everyone this is the A300-600 addon.  I miss typed. 
Sorry again."
,djsiryn,2006-11-18T10:20Z,"sorry but this is for a few uploads that i have done....I am kinda new to this torrent thing and I have been tryinf to give the best uploads possible for me but i keep getting complaints. If I keep getting complaints i am going to stop uploading all together. Let alone the non seeding people. Remember these are free and mostly free and pirated copies. I am trying my best and want to share my collection with you all but I will not share if no one else seeds......please seed till your ratio is at least 1.50 or more...actually more around 1.80 and the seed will last for a long time. Thank you
