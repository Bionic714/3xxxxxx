The Washington Redskins kept their playoff hopes on life support, and gained their first conference and division win by defeating the Dallas Cowboys in dramatic fashion at FedEx field.

Early in the game, Washington's offense appeared to have benefitted from the bye week and mounted a sharp opening drive. Brunell hit several medium-range passes down the seam, and the Skins drove close to the Dallas end zone. But the drive bogged down near the goal line and Washington could not punch the ball over in six tries, including a fourth down gamble that turned the ball back over to Dallas.

The Skins' defense instantly took advantage of the field position, as Lamar Marshall met Julius Jones in the backfield as he took a handoff, tackling him in the end zone for a safety. Following Dallas' punt, Washington again drove deep into Cowboys' territory but had to settle for a FG making the score 5-0.

Dallas was able to strike back in the 2nd quarter, driving 60 yards for a Romo-to-Glenn TD. Parcells elected to try for two but the attempt failed, leaving the Cowboys with a 6-5 lead. Washington seemed to be driving to an answering score when Brunell mishandled a snap and Dallas recovered. The Cowobys capitalized with a FG, making their lead 9-5.

The Skins got the ball back with about three minutes left in the half and struck quickly, with Portis darting almost untouched around the left side for a 38 yard TD. Washington reclaimed the lead at 12-9. Romo led Dallas through an efficient two-minute drill, setting them up for a tying FG with only seconds left in the half.

Dallas opened up the second half with a long drive culminating in an Ownens TD, giving them a 19-12 lead. The teams traded punts until early in the fourth quarter, when Washington moved deep into Dallas territory courtesy of a long pass interference penalty. Brunnel found Cooley in the corner of the end zone for a tying TD.

Neither team could mount a significant drive for much of the rest of the fourth quarter, but the field position seemed to be swinging in the Skins' favor. With 35 seconds left in the game, Washington set up for 49 yard FG try by Novak. The kick sailed wide right, and the game appeared headed for overtime. Dallas came out firing, however, and with 18 seconds left had driven into Washington territory, although still out of field goal range. Romo appeared to set Dallas up for a win on the next play, gashing the middle of Washington's defense for a 28 yard strike to Jason Witten. Vanderjagt lined up for what appeared to be a chip-shot game-winner, but his attempt was blocked by a diving Troy Vincent. Sean Taylor scooped up the blocked kick and returned it into Dallas territory as time ran out on the clock. But a face mask during the return moved the ball 15 yards closer and gave the Redskins one untimed play. Novak lined up for a 47 yard attempt, and this time the ball spun just inside the left upright, sending the FedEx crowd into a frenzy.

RIP Sean Taylor
