The Fifth Estate - Sticks & Stones.

The United States is in the midst of a very un-civil war. It's a
war of words that's pitting conservative against liberal, that's
already divided the country into red and blue. The new gladiators
are commentators like Bill O'Reilly and Ann Coulter and their forum
is the television studios of networks like Fox. It's loud, it's
raucous, but does it have anything to do with the truth?
