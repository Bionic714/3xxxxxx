,administron,2008-02-23T17:27Z,"For what it's worth, the WHOLE POINT of using a lossy codec is to decrease filesize, and they generally do a damn good job at it.  If you compress a ~700MB AVI file with RAR or ZIP or any other such format and manage to save more than five megabytes, then whoever encoded it probably made a major fuckup.  The only use for archive formats when dealing with stuff like this is to split it up into chunks, and with bittorrent that's just redundant.  Bittorrent isn't half as broken or ugly as USENET, but many (stupid) groups have yet to figure that out, because they RAR an AVI file into forty-nine separate little chunks before uploading it.  If you're gonna put it on USENET, fine, just extract it before you make a torrent out of it.  Surely you can afford three minutes to remove an extraneous compression layer, and save everyone else the trouble.  Face it; nobody keeps movies on a metric fuckton of 15MB floppies.

And to clarify: no, this torrent doesn't contain a RAR file or an assload of silly R00/R01/R02/whatever files.  Thank God for the intelligent distributors."
