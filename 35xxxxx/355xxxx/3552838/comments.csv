,oragorn,2006-11-07T13:10Z,"anybody who's done downloading and watching care to comment how this file turns out? comments from another site cite problems (such as, out of sync) from usually reliable release."
,JuhaT,2006-11-07T15:29Z,"all XviD-LOL releases are great quality, I´ve never ran to a bad video made by these guys. Thanks a lot :D"

= )"
,etatauri,2006-11-07T21:56Z,"yeah, this release does have a sync issue. but its still watchable. the picture lags about a second behind the sound."
,mmster,2006-11-07T23:50Z,Ja herre jävlar... nu tätnar det. De måste ha slagit världsrekord i att ta sig ur omöjliga situationer i den här serien... Men det är bra.
,mmster,2006-11-07T23:52Z,"And If you ask me there is NO sync issue. Plays perfectly in PowerDVD on my computer.

Great release!"
,PsyMan2000,2006-11-08T00:16Z,"Anyone with sync problems, try updating your codecs before blaming the video. It solved all of my sync problems. Remember these LOL guys and anyone ripping this stuff are gonna be using the latest, not 6 month old ones."
,GameGuNotNigga,2006-11-08T10:43Z,"Some Fuckin Retard must have synced this ? omg.. there is about 15 min. out of sync.. not totally fucked.. but still ? i'm used to crazy quality from lol ?

but maybe it's my codecs i should update? don't knnow shit about how to do that? Help ? :D"
,Heybaperiba,2006-11-08T13:44Z,"Use VLCplayer instead of whatever you are using, no sync problem, no shit, great quality...
VLC plays every fileformat thats out there.
By the way,LOL: great quality, again..."
,rasoul,2006-11-08T17:34Z,"Do not download and do not seed this shit,
out of sync.
Better to wait for new release from someother."
,Shadowcrafter1121,2006-11-08T21:16Z,"Thx.
Just seed :=)"
,CarlMemphis,2006-11-09T00:06Z,"Rasoul: How did you manage to pull your head out of your ass long enough to type that bullshit? There is a heap of effort behind putting releases like this together, and I haven't seen anyone pulling it off better than LOL does.
Having sync problems is an obvious issue here, but it's got nothing to do with the original file, and is not even close to a reason why morons like you should be allowed to spread this kind of disinformation."
,rasoul,2006-11-09T00:27Z,"you are a damn fool CarlMemphis.
Every normal person can say this release is a litle bit out of sync.

The only thing i said was better to wait for another releace who aint out of sync,

And itis'nt a codec problem because i have'been tesing with vlc and other players.

If you know your release are out of sync like previus episode why dont say so att first place,
Right CarlMemphis, mom to hoe and fool??"
,malvax,2006-11-09T12:37Z,nice download 900kb/s =) thanks..
