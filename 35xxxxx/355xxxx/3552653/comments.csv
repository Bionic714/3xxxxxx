,Kotten,2006-11-07T18:55Z,"Please seed!

I've downloaded at 300-500 kb/s until 90% or so but now it's down to almost 0 kb/s.

When I've downloaded it I'll seed as much as I can but I would rather like to have the entire movie :S"
,Kotten,2006-11-07T20:04Z,"Apparently really hard.

I've been seeding at over 1000 kb/s but right now I've lowered it to 400. "
,Kotten,2006-11-07T20:27Z,"ffs seed!

This torrent hasn't even been online for 24 hours. 31 people has downloaded it so atleast a few could seed it!

,Belajavorona,2006-11-09T20:49Z,"Downloaded alright for me, but didn't unpack properly. My computer just got hung up while trying. Why seed it when it didn't work?"
,Kotten,2006-11-10T00:52Z,"Belajavorona 

Wierd. It worked fine for me. Try again."
[V],esso99,2006-11-11T10:31Z,"Visst - öppnar för seedning igen men...
med risk för att ni inte heller kan bränna ner 
den  (""DVD-Video files real location failed"")"
[V],esso99,2006-11-11T10:39Z,"Det följde visst med en fil för mycket i paketet!
Ta bort ""VIDEO_TS.VOB"" (0 b) så går den att
bränna utan problem!"
,No Need,2006-11-11T23:55Z,l2seed nubs
,devvi,2006-11-13T22:09Z,seed plz !
,Lilla ja 72,2006-11-15T14:56Z,"Läste kommentaren av ""esso 99"" att en fil skulle tas bort. Denna fil har jag inte problem med, men enligt ""brännaren"" hittar den inte ""VIDEO_TS.IFO"". Denna fil finns dock med och är ok. Vad kan programmet vara ute efter? Har provat med olika program, men inte lyckats bränna med något (t ex Shrink, Nero). Är det någon som har något bra tips?

Tack alla generösa där ute..."

,Prebmar,2006-11-21T18:07Z,Puttiplatt Kan du forklare litt nermere hvordan du gjorde det? Jeg prøvde med Nero og fikk bare masse feil meldinger..
