,Trotyl,2006-12-25T22:05Z,"Is trying to seed more often, however, very few knows of it, so very few downloads it.
Too bad, cause it's a good movie.

One of my favorites on alien abductions !"

,steinos,2007-02-23T13:11Z,"hadde vært kjekt med litt seeding. Alle er stoppet på 88% Håper på flere seedere etter at vi 9 har fått lastet ned:-)

would have been nice with a bit of seeding. Everybody is stuck at 88%. Hoping for more seeders after the 9 of us is finished downloading:-)"
,Trotyl,2007-03-13T13:51Z,"No seeding needed now, is it ?"
,yesmalion,2007-10-11T06:59Z,"Could you please seed again?-I can't find it anywhere else and I've been looking for weeks, thanks."
