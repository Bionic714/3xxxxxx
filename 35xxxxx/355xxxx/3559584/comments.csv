,nickricci,2006-11-18T19:03Z,I did burn it and install. But the game asking for the disc. No crack???
,Ricky123456,2006-11-18T20:04Z,Has anyone got the DVD version of this? I've been looking everywhere.
,Purepwnstar,2006-11-18T23:27Z,You have to keep the disk mounted while you play the game.  I haven't heard of a dvd version...   
,Purepwnstar,2006-11-18T23:46Z,"Oh, right... the dvd game."
,Ricky123456,2006-11-19T02:38Z,"Do you have it? If so, upload and send me a Pm with the link please.. "
,Purepwnstar,2006-11-19T05:04Z,"No, I'm sorry man. I was also interested in the dvd game..."
,bubba20061,2006-11-19T11:41Z,does anyone have the crack for this game ?
,Ricky123456,2006-11-19T14:41Z,What are the requirements for this game?
,Ricky123456,2006-11-19T15:19Z,"There's loads of seeders and that, and the download is just too slow, any ideas why?"
,Purepwnstar,2006-11-19T21:02Z,"There is currently no crack for this game.  Just keep it mounted to play.  To get faster downloads open a port on your router for your bittorrent client.  It'll be the ""listening port"" number that you'll have to forward.  I have a direct connection with the router and I have the listening port forwarded on utorrent, the client i use, and I was dling this at a steady 250 kb/s"
,nissanfrontier04,2006-11-21T00:18Z,so what just burn the deal or no deal iso folder to disc?
,Purepwnstar,2006-11-21T02:44Z,"You could.  I recommend just mounting it with powerISO or Alcohol 120%.  If not, burn the image to a disk."
,Ricky123456,2006-11-21T17:13Z,"If you're using Nero, go to Start - All Programs - Nero -  Nero OEM - Click Nero Express then press burn image to disk, select .iso.


Thank you for this. ;)"
,Ricky123456,2006-11-21T18:50Z,Is the UK version out?

,nissanfrontier04,2006-11-24T03:13Z,burnt folder to disc and still says insert disc
,Purepwnstar,2006-11-24T05:15Z,"Burnt image to disk?  Make sure you use the ""burn image"" function."
,Ricky123456,2006-11-24T14:58Z,"I know it's the american version.. Is the UK one out?

Also, do not burn the folder to disc, just the .iso"
,T88MobDon88T,2007-01-18T05:50Z,It keeps telling me that it can't find d3dx9_30.dll and yet I still see it in the folder. Help. :(
,extremestunter,2007-10-19T04:21Z,"I have installed the game, but when I try to play it, it asks for the CD.  I have tried to burn the ISO with Nero multiple times with many different ways, but I cannot seem to get it to work.  What do I do?"
