In some ** way the program knows I used a keygen because it is ""unable to activate"".
How did you other solve it? Somebody please help otherwise its as good as a tryout version from adobes website"

,TorrentThief,2007-01-03T04:32Z,"Go here: http://paradox.crackteam.ws/get.shtml?176626 and get the keygen they're offering.  It will create the serial then you click on the phone activation option when it asks you to register and enter the code the phone activation gives you, the keygen will then give you an authorization code.  TaDa, you will never be asked to activate it again."

,DmnrThem3th,2007-04-28T11:54Z,"dream_catcher, mounting image means, that you open the .iso file in daemon tools. Then this file is like cd.

Put 'Activation code' on request code (in keygen file in MAGNiTUDE). Then you got Responce code. Put that on the registeration window."
,keystoneman,2007-05-03T01:43Z,"someone please help me! when i try to open the ""windows installer package"" it says it wont support the SSE2. and when i try to run ""setup"" it has a runtime error. what do i do?"
,dannydog2,2007-06-12T00:07Z,this is a fake.  it asks you for a serial number but there is absolutely no way of accessing the Activate by Phone mechanism as reported by previous comments.
,dannydog2,2007-06-17T21:14Z,okay i take it back....it's NOT a fake...i'm just very very stupid.. For anyone who's really stupid like me then you use the Serial Number in the KeyGen and THEN activate by phone. :-D

,termin8or123,2007-06-21T04:04Z,"Ok here is a full in-depth tutorial, on how to successfully install Adobe Premiere Pro 2.

1. Download the torrent. Once you have done that mount the m-appv20 with Deamon Tools, Nero, Virtual Clone Drive, or Alcohol 120%. Each of these programs work.

2. Once you have mounted the file, a new window will pop-up. Now go to the folder that says MAGNiTUDE and open. Once inside double click the keygen to generate your serial number.  Highlight and copy the serial and leave the keygen window open.

3. Now go back into the main folder, and open the folder that says Adobe Premiere Pro. Once inside double click the icon that says Adobe Premiere Pro 2.0 . DO NOT DOUBLE CLICK SETUP.

4. Now once you double click it will begin the installation, but at first it will ask you for the serial number. Paste the serial number you got from the keygen (see step #2 if lost) in the box indicated. And run the installation.

5. Once it is installed it will say Activation Period 30 Day Period over. Something like that. It will ask you to activate it, well click the option for more. Then click the option activate by phone. It will now give you your serial again and the activation code. Copy the activation code, and paste it in the Request Code: Box in the keygen opened earlier. It will now give you the Response Code. 

6. Now copy that code  and paste it in the box that asks for the Authorization Code. Once you do that it should work! If not use this keygen from here to generate your Auth Code. http://paradox.crackteam.ws/get.shtml?176626

Well Congratulations! You now have Adobe Premiere Pro 2. A Wonderful Program. Hope this helped! Enjoy!"

Thank you."
,lhw,2007-12-27T18:14Z,"In case anyone else is interested in this torrent, I've just installed it and so far, it seems to work so thank you to the uploader. Judging by the comments some people are still having trouble installing this. Termin8or123 has written an excellent tutorial so I won't repeat it. 
For the newbies - ""mounting"" the file means that you use a CD/DVD emulator programme which will read the file as if it is a CD/DVD. I started by using PowerISO but that didn't work so I used MagicDisc which did the trick. As the file seems to be an iso file, I presume you can also burn it as a DVD and run it off your DVD drive. Otherwise follow the instructions carefully and you should be able to install it.
Finally by reading old reviews, I believe it only works with XP "
,dont23,2008-02-11T23:25Z,"Works good! Thanks termin80r123 for the tutorial. I used MagicDisc to mount, and then had to browse cd for the ""window to pop up""."
