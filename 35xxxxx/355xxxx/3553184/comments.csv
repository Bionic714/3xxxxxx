,jayeuk,2006-11-10T16:39Z,Which loader / emulator do you useto load this? Thanks
,lpezster,2006-11-10T17:33Z,"I use 2.71 SE-B''. But i know Devhook work(search it) :)
You can download installers that install everything for you."
,jayeuk,2006-11-10T17:58Z,"Thanks lpezer. Still not getting any joy. I've got a psp that's downgraded to 1.50 so I'm guessing this is why I'm having problems. Not very technically minded I'm afraid. Checked out 2.71 seb which I don't think is gonna work for me and my version of devhook doesn't want to know either. Any ideas?
Once again thanks for helping out the novice!"
,swedench,2006-11-10T18:36Z,i have the first  FW 2.71 devhook it works flawless =D thx for upload
,lpezster,2006-11-11T01:08Z,"It's really easy actually!

I'll give you a good guide.

I hope you get it sorted out!"
,lpezster,2006-11-11T01:10Z,"I forgot to mention, remember to update SE-B to SE-B''

Or if it's too advanced, try devhook 46.
With these settings:
UMD SELECT: select your ISO
UMD MOUNT: ISO ANYUMD
UMD VERSION: no change
FIRMWARE: 2.71(MS hook)
CPU CLOCK: 222 Mhz (333 if experiencing lag but network functions will have issues, see T08 about this)
BOOT SELECT: Reboot XMB
PL-ADR: 89000000 (in: OTHER/preload address menu)"

,jayeuk,2006-11-13T13:50Z,"Lpezter, Thanks a lot mate. Everything is now up and running and the upload is working perfectly! Good to see there's some decent people on here who are willing to help new people rather than the idiots who call you all the names under the sun cos you don't understand something. Cheers buddy."

,arata75,2011-06-21T14:44Z,"Zerocell911 is right, I have the cso version of this game and it's pretty laggy. It's not *too* bad, but it's definitely noticeable and annoying.

So really you have two choices here, each with its own tradeoffs:

- Get the iso version and have no lag, but the file is large.

- Or, save space with the cso version yet suffer the moderate lag.

I only have a 4GB card and lots of downloaded games, but I'd still rather swap out than run laggy cso files.

But again, to each his own."
,arata75,2011-06-21T23:15Z,Ffffuuuuuuuck this version won't recognize the save file I've been playing on with the cso version and I can't figure out why. Is there a way to fix this? I don't want to start over. :/
,arata75,2011-06-22T00:45Z,"Nevermind, fixed it. I just took my original cso file and used UMDGen to convert it back to iso."
