Story: High school senior Shuji Ito falls in love with his best friend at school, the very popular Hiroyuki Yoshida. As their friendship develops, Ito wants to tell Yoshida about his feelings for him. But Yoshida develops a crush on new girl in town Kasana Aihara.

My Thoughts: This is no ideal high school film, instead it depicts high school boys Ito and his crush on his male classmate, Yoshida. Things get even more complicated as Yoshida has a crush on a newly transfered girl student, Aihara.
Aihara is not interested in Yoshida, but she forms a friendship with Ito. A rather complex friendship occurs.
The narrow minded japanese society has not accepted homosexuals in that time, instead they are treated as sick people in the hospital. A dark themed yet beautiful film! Emotionally powerful as the characters are no simple minded,
each of them have problems of their own but they just can\'t express them well. I highly recommend this film! This is a gem among the japanese movies, \"golden oldies\"! PS. The film features the teenage Ayumi Hamasaki, the current jpop queen. Witness her acting skill, hehe.
