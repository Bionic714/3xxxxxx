Release Notes:

Superstar rapper and hip hop icon Snoop Dogg readies for his highly anticipated
album "Tha Blue Carpet Treatment" releasing on November 21, 2006 through
Doggystyle/Geffen.

Early buzz from industry insiders promise a classic album complete with the
reunion of Snoop and DR. DRE with three bangers from the dynamic duo. This
classic pairing marks the duo's first collaborative effort in approximately five
years and promises to make history once again.

"Tha Blue Carpet Treatment" is a return to the original sound that put the Long
Beach rapper on the map with Snoop keeping it gangsta on each and every record.
Following the street single, "Vato," produced by PHARRELL and featuring B-REAL,
comes the highly anticipated second single, "That's That" produced by NOTTZ and
featuring R&B crooner R. KELLY. This catchy and melodic song was most added at
Urban and Rhythmic formats, proving it is shaping up to be another platinum hit
for the West Coast "Boss." Snoop says, "'That's That' is theme music for a
classy gangsta party - that's when you ladies pull out the high heels and the
playas pull out the three-piece suits. You'll see in the video! Me and R. KELLY
had a lot of fun shooting this one."

Throughout the album, Snoop takes it back to the hood showcasing the gritty
realness that helped shape his status as a cultural icon. XXL writes, "Snoop's
lyrical fire seems resurrected, as he delivers arguably his most consistently
scorching work post-Doggystyle." Thirsty fans will be thrilled with the thought
provoking song "Imagine," produced by and featuring DR. DRE, which reflects on
what life would be like for the California natives without hip hop. The
signature DR. DRE piano riff is complimented by the D'ANGELO sung chorus,
marking the first time fans have heard D'ANGELO in six long years. Another album
favorite is club banger "Psst," produced by JAMIE FOXX, N8 and BRAINZ and
features JAMIE FOXX's signature falsetto on the hook. The album also features
two collaborations with AKON, "Boss's Life" produced by DR. DRE and the current
radio smash "I Wanna Love You," the latter also being on AKON's upcoming album.
Of the album, Snoop says, "Tha Blue Carpet Treatment is my presentation to the
world on what it means to be the King of the West Coast. I really worked extra
hard on making this one perfect and got the best of the best among my homies in
the music game- SKATEBOARD P, TIMBALAND, R. KELLY, D'ANGELO... and you know when
me and DR. DRE get together - it's a monster."

As a gift to loyal fans, Snoop is treating 9 winners to "Tha Blue Carpet
Treatment." Nine winning tickets will be placed inside random CDs of the album
which reward the lucky recipient with a diamond Ice link watch. The grand prize
winner will win a diamond Ice Link watch worth $100,000. Three winners will be
prized with diamond Ice Link watches worth $10,000 and five winners will get
diamond Ice Link watches worth $5,000.

As if Snoop were not busy enough, he also recently released his first book,
"Love Don't Live Here No More," a story loosely based on his own life's trials
and tribulations. The book, co-written by playwright David E. Talbert, is the
first in a series of novels called Doggy Tales that takes readers from the
unforgiving streets of Long Beach to the bright lights of show business.
