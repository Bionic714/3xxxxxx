imagine watching a vhs videotape made in the 80's that has been watched 500 times and your watching on a 4 inch screen and any bigger than 4 inches and you lose even more quality

with so much decent quality stuff out there why this

im sure the site if you click on the 700kbs download speed then its better quality"
