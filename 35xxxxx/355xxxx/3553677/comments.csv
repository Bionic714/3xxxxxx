,Rboy,2006-12-02T08:24Z,I have reconstructed the torrent the only episode I could not find is the first one (the right version)  I am seeding now and the torrent will complete to 97.8%  If anyone can find the the right episode 1 Close your torrent completely rename episode 1 to the name in your download file and replace the exsisting file then restart the torrent.  This will give us a complete copy If I find the right episode I I will do it but so far no luck.
