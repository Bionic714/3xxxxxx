,Bhador,2006-11-12T02:17Z,kul som fan och lira på fyllan... bomba polarna med banabomer. tack som fasen för det här. underbart nostalgi
,Zackeee_w,2006-11-12T08:27Z,"Is the only way of playing this game to burn it down to a CD?? 

cant u just upload it like everybody else?
':)"
,seedaren (bra dator),2006-11-15T08:04Z,I wonder one thing?... can i mount this in DAEMON-tools? if i can't.. i don't know what to do :/ please help for instructions! :D
,varmekanin,2006-11-22T03:15Z,"Neither me or my cousine gets sound in Mayhem from this release, are the sound ripped away or is the game shit and only support a very limited range of hardware? (Integrated realtek acl850 or whatever it's called on via k8t800 chipset, sb audigy or whatever he has.)"
,AlkaLiner1800,2006-11-25T14:59Z,"Yeah I cant get any sound in Mayhem either...
If anyone knows a solution it's highly appriciated.

Thx for the upload btw!!"
,meer.station,2006-11-26T12:30Z,OMG i installed the game the starting credits show and then bam program exits :< lame lame and my brother can't get the sound working on his laptop eeek omh omh 
,Malendor,2006-12-02T16:16Z,i hope it goes fast ;) if it does then GREAT!
,Rcco3,2006-12-03T19:24Z,Does somebody know how much disk space is required to install all these 5 games?
,ThaGunnerz,2006-12-16T23:11Z,"great game,  downloading 200kB/s ;D"
,destroier645,2006-12-21T15:33Z,"I don't know how a 700MB file can possibilty have 5 games when each occupy at least one cd, (and worms 4 is even 1,4GB), but it does!

*Worms 3d- haven't played it much, but it appears to work perfect even with a file being corrupt, ! The music and voices have been hipped away, but it does have fx.
*Worms Forts- works perfect! It appears that only the music was ripped away, cause everything appears to be there!
*Worms 4- also works perfect, but all sounds have been ripped away. Even then, it's a great game!
*Worms Blast- don't know how the game shoud be, but it seems that nothing is missing! It even has music! works perfect!
*Worms World Party- works perfect, everything is there but the music.

When you mount/burn the image, a very nice install screen asks what game you want to install. Just choose one, choose where to install and play! No cracking needed and no virusses found!
Great great great package! Thanks ;)! "
,destroier645,2006-12-24T15:02Z,"Now that I've played those games a little more, there are some things to correct in my comment:
*the file that were corrupt in the worms3d makes it impossible to play the 11th mission. Don't know if it's THE download or MY download, but just in case some1 got a non corrupt ""bundle11.xor(or xom)"", post it here plz!
*worms world party has music, so it's complete!
*don't know if there were supposed to be some non-engine videos in the games, but if they have, they were ripped away. the only videos they have are the engine ones (the ones made form the actual game, not a ""real"" video), but these ""real videos"" barely affect the game (I don't even know if they exist!). The engine ones do their jobs just as well."
,<JesC>,2006-12-28T00:43Z,"Nice, thx Zero!

,Dizquard,2007-06-18T14:44Z,"- Sir Jah - 
Use Daemon Tools(Free software) to create a virtual drive on your pc. After installation, leftclick on the icon in the systemtray and mount the image file. That should do the trick;)"

,0Dantheman0,2008-01-29T15:41Z,"TO ALL PIRATE BAY USERS, This is By far the best worms pack and comes in a uncomplicated nrg. format.
HERES WHAT YOU NEED TO DO:
Get A program called Daemon tools lite(google it) then once its installed click on the icon it will say mount an image, now find the Worms file then mount that give it  a few secs and Bingo you got Worms! Keep On Seeding!!!"

,MatteKalle,2008-05-18T14:15Z,"WORMS WORLD PARTY

Kul om så många som möjligt spelar det...
därför ska jag hjälpa er som har problem med att få det till att fungera riktigt under Vista.

ctrl+alt+delete
aktivitetshanteraren
processer
avsluta process explorer.exe
starta sedan spelet genom att välja arkiv - ny aktivitet (kör...)

Jag har även inställt på att köra spelet i kompatibilitetsläge för win98/win me och ikryssat att köra det som admin.
Dessa ändringar vet jag inte om man behöver göra.

I vilket fall så funkar det felfritt för mig. Det blir aldrig något fel med färgerna eller så"
