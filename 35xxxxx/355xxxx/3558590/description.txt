The Worst Witch is a series of children\\\'s books written and illustrated by Jill Murphy. The title refers to the main character, Mildred Hubble, who is the worst student at Miss Cackle\\\'s Academy for Witches. It is also the name of the first book in the series.

Mildred is well meaning, but tends to let her enthusiasm get the better of her, and does things without thinking. The benevolent headmistress, Miss Cackle, is generally understanding, whereas Mildred\\\'s form teacher, the virago Miss Hardbroom (with whom Harry Potter\\\'s Severus Snape is often compared) thinks she just isn\\\'t trying hard enough.
