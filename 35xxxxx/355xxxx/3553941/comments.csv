,unpur3,2008-01-04T19:44Z,"one of the best games ever. thank you so much for the torrent, I've lost my old CD of it and I got this urge to play it once more =)"
,How Long,2008-01-08T09:27Z,"If you're getting an error at startup about not having a disk in the drive, then answer the following question:

Did you mount the image to a program like Daemon Tools before installing, or did you simply extract the contents of the .rar before running the Setup.exe?

If you did the latter then uninstall the game, mount the image and install from there. Worked fine for me and hopefully it will work just as well for you."
,looking54,2008-01-23T09:39Z,"wow , how fast does this game run , it like speedy road runner , is there a way to command propt the game to slow down the engine a little , "

,LoneFullmetal,2008-02-10T15:28Z,"@ everyone with the speed problem

I think I might have the solution, though I haven't tried it on this game yet, it has worked on other games that had the exact same problems.

Of course if you don't have a dual core, and it doesn't work for you, then I don't know what's wrong :/"
,Diozakrod,2008-02-20T13:52Z,"Having the same problem as the guy above, also running Vista. Even the same problem with the crack (There is no effects folder in C:\DeusEx)"
,Diozakrod,2008-02-20T14:22Z,"MrWilloch

I found a fix. http://forums.eidosgames.com/showthread.php?t=57187
3rd post down, worked for me... BUT.

I can start the game fine, but when I try to start training, or a new game, the game just goes to the Deus ex logo, and won't do anything untill I press a button, and even when I do that, it just takes me back to the main menu."
,vanity_eleven,2008-04-24T17:42Z,"This game is intriguing for 2008. Nice game ""thej0o""  !"
,cyberpunkx,2008-06-02T05:02Z,this is a most excellent game. cheers =)
,iabandonedmychild,2008-06-24T11:34Z,Does anyone have a solution to Vista's igfx problem? I play the game for a while and then it crashes and says that the igfx module has crashed and recovered. This has happened to me in the past and I'm tired of it.
,XenOtai,2008-08-13T09:55Z,"iabandonedmychild, yes. Uninstall Vista and install XP."
,criteria192,2008-12-02T03:32Z,"Anyone having the problem where the game's install freezes at Uncompressing Data Files, You have to go into task manager and to your processes, and in order, end the processes SystemFiles.exe, TextureFiles.exe, MPMaps.exe.

This should let you continue through the installation and successfully complete it. Happy playing guys!"
,samfreak,2009-01-22T05:51Z,"I discovered the problem with the game crashing on vista whenever you try to load a game, tutorial, whatever. Vista problem, maybe on XP, too.

All you have to do is run the Installer from the iso in Windows 95 Compatibility mode and it works perfect.
You still have to do the other instructions listed, ending the processes generated by the installer. But do all this and it should work perfectly. "
,Porgos,2009-03-13T01:30Z,"http://cwdohnal.home.mindspring.com/utglr/

That page contains much improved OpenGL renderers, the latest for Deus Ex is 1.9 (for game version 1112fm) Use the new renderers, you'll thank me later..."
,killerkomb,2009-03-18T07:17Z,"I had this game when I was like 5 and my mom didnt know what the M Rating meant, DLing at 200Kbps so hopefully this Torrent works,

Thanks"
,RedCommie,2009-03-21T21:09Z,thanks criteria192! That solved the problem!
,RedCommie,2009-03-23T16:42Z,"Hmm, can't go past the opening menu. No matter what I select 'new game' or 'training', it just loops back to the intro."
,Armaments,2009-04-06T01:26Z,"Works perfectly, thanks for the up.

To install:
1) Unrar the iso file
2) Run setup.bat
3) Choose the place you want it to be installed

Pretty simple :P

Thanks again thej0o!"
,Rizles,2009-04-09T15:31Z,"Did have some problems installing this originally. Tried installing with compatability for XP (I'm running Vista) and now it works no problems.

Thanks very much, great game :D"
