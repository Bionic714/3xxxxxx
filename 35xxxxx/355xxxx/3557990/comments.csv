,huh123,2006-11-18T01:29Z,"Just add the . in the spaces
For some reason it wouldent let me post the tracker like that"
,bethrezen,2006-12-08T18:28Z,"any possibility to get some seeding for this?

i mean... only 2 downloads and 1 seeder... and it's been almost a month"
,Epinox,2006-12-18T10:24Z,You know its evil to have a .torrent's filename to start with an . don't you? Some noob linux users like me becomes confused.
,Miss Ghostly,2006-12-19T18:41Z,"please seed, been stuck at 86.4% for almost a month now :("
,uber_jedi,2006-12-24T15:28Z,"Yeah....there are about 6 people stuck at 84.6% and they all upload like dial-up users.
Is there anyway that huh123 could upload for a week at least??"
,Shinji-no-tenshi,2007-02-03T09:07Z,Wtf... SEED!! IM A DAMN FAN OF .HACK//SIGN!!
,moonlightofdeath,2007-06-18T17:57Z,Why would you put a damn period in front of the file name?  Are you just fucking retarded and don't know anything?  A .file in Mac OS X is hidden.  Thanks for making me download some shitty program you asshole.
,j00n325,2007-08-10T07:09Z,"Please seed, I just stared downloading this again, becuase I really wanted to watch this series again in order to introduce it to my girlfriend at the same time.  =)  Thank you!

"
,Ronald McDonald,2007-12-23T07:33Z,Those complaining about the . at the beginning of the filename: couldn't you just change the name when you download the .torrent file?
,LLawlietRyuzaki,2008-04-04T20:20Z,"I actually made an account on this site to leave this comment...

This is 1-28+Extras, not 1-29.

It's also not in English, it's in Japanese, without subtitles.

Very disappointing... But who knows, maybe I did something wrong...let's see.

Downloaded it, opened folder, opened media file in a media player... Nope seems all ok on my end. =/"
,Kool2bchilln,2008-05-10T16:28Z,"""Why would you put a damn period in front of the file name? Are you just fucking retarded and don't know anything? A .file in Mac OS X is hidden. Thanks for making me download some shitty program you asshole.""

LMMFAO!!! OH IM ROFLLLLIN!! YOU SUCK MAC BALLS! LMAO!

When you start the download, it gives you the CHOICE of what folder you want it in... dumbass"
,Thalinor,2008-07-19T15:09Z,"LOL to the a$$hole with the mac:  If you are too stupid to use your mac then no one can help you, there is nothing else left for you.  Sorry man, your SOL.  The ""."" is there because its in the title of this anime idiot.

Next, the the jacka$$ who says its not in english.  I have not gotten the files yet (still DL) but they are .mkv files so my guess is they are dual audio.  9 times out of 10 when there is an .mkv file and someone bitches its not in the audio they want its because they are too stupid to know what they are doing.  Get ""VLC media player"" and use the menu's to choose the right audio language format idiot."
,Thalinor,2008-07-19T15:19Z,"I missed this one.  To the idiot that says its 28+1 and not 29.  You are on the internet, why not fucking use it?  

The show is 26+3 bonus extras.  I can only guess the guy who made the torrent (thank you BTW!) meant that it was the total show (26) with the extras (3) for a total of 29.  Its a bit confusing yes, but if you use your fucking head you can figure it out.  

"".hack//Sign (trademarked as .hack//SIGN) is an anime television series directed by K?ichi Mashimo and produced by studio Bee Train and Bandai Visual, that makes up one of the four original storylines of the .hack franchise. Twenty six original episodes aired on TV and three additional bonus episodes (Intermezzo, Unison, and Gift) were released on DVD as OVAs.[2] """
,Thalinor,2008-07-19T19:12Z,"Update:  I am at 12% but checked the files that have come through and they ARE DUAL AUDIO (English/Jap).

Don't listen to the idiot who said thay are not; he's a jackass.

The only Torrent that I have found to be a lie about the audio was Black Lagoon Complete 1st & 2nd Season.  The person that ripped that and seeded it said that it was dual audio and lied (They were .mkv files with jap only audio).  This was to be expected as the eng dub of Black Lagoon Second Season is not out till the end of summer 08.

Anyway, again... this torrent IS IN BOTH ENGLISH AND JAP Audio.  If you do not know how to use .mkv files use the fucking internet and look them up.  Stop posting BS about torrents that work fine. "
,Gortie,2008-08-29T01:48Z,Great upload. Thanks a bunch. =)
,traveling_east,2008-12-30T15:41Z,"Thanks for the upload huh123. For some reason, probably related to VLC newest version 0.9.8a, the English subtitle are not displayed in the screen, although they are listed and checked in the video tab. Can somebody confirm if they work with this version of VLC? For now I downloaded KMPlayer and the subtitles are displayed properly."
,azuren,2009-04-07T13:52Z,"estupenda serie, aunke la serie en si consta de 26 episodios + 2 ovas( episodios 27 y 28)

,GalvinTjime,2009-06-20T17:52Z,"I have a question. I recently ripped the ISOs of the entire collection of .hack//SIGN DVDs and was wondering if anyone was interested in downloading the full ISOs. They are around 7 Gbs in size but are the full quality. If anyone would like them please, let me know."
,Braveskin,2009-07-30T09:03Z,"@GalvinTjime:

I'd love an .iso download. If you upload it, would you mind linking me to it at ""braveskingmailcom""?

Thanks."

,hellboyjuggalo,2010-03-11T22:02Z,yeah you need to have your discription include that it's not in english and that it does not include subtitles. and to the fuck with the mac i have a mac too and shit works fine for me so stop bitching and be less of a fucking n00b. only thing was i reformated the movies to avi cause it's smaller size but the original files worked too dumbass

,DorianLun,2011-02-14T07:06Z,"the demonoid tracker listed in the beginning doesn't work, likely due to demonoid moving their servers.  if anyone has the updated tracker for it please post."
,Kyolution,2011-02-19T15:02Z,"A quick note: The 27th episode in this torrent, ""Evidence"" is actually the 15th episode in the series.  Its just a recap of the series up to that point though."
