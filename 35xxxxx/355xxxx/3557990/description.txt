Plot
*Quote from wikipedia:
In the year 2005, a computer virus called \\\\\\\"Pluto Kiss\\\\\\\" destroys the networks of computers all around the world, subjecting the cyberspace to severe restrictions. Two years later, as free access to the networks recovers, people are now crazed over a full-immersion virtual gaming environment called \\\\\\\"The World.\\\\\\\" Reality and virtual reality collide and an adventure unfolds. A mysterious accident leaves one player of the game, a \\\\\\\"Wave Master\\\\\\\" named Tsukasa, permanently logged in. A group of ciphers must figure out the truth behind Tsukasa while a rash of mysterious game-related incidents in the real world begins to draw the attention of even the most powerful players within the game.
