You can also see Hell House, a hard-to-find documentary comparable to Jesus Camp."

Interesting to note, that in the 1600's, the ""rednecks"" or ""covenanters"" or ""Scots-Irish presbyterians"" were originally kicked out of Britaln for agitating for the overthrow of the Monarchy and setting up a Theocratic state. So it's a long tradition with these people."
