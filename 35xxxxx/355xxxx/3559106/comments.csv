,slowpanther24,2007-11-17T17:20Z,"you have to burn the iso image to a disk cd-r and then run the disk install.  or you can mount the image using nero.

burn image with alchol120, powerISO, NERO, etc."
,Joe_purdy,2007-12-22T23:32Z,This is not a .iso file
,Macaque,2008-03-27T03:38Z,"You can safely sign in if you want, or just work offline (should still be possible in Money 2007).
It's just linking you to an MS Passport to protect your file and allow you to share your money data online.
I downloaded 2006 and then bought a copy the following week after I liked it - there's no serial number or anything so MS has no way of knowing it's pirated."
,DarKMaSk,2008-04-19T09:33Z,"There should be a serial in ""help->about microsoft money 2007"". Check that and there should be the expiry date also."
,gsdjj,2008-08-14T15:09Z,"I downloaded this, it kindly wipes off your exisiting version of MS Money Personal & Business, then wont run any saved files you have. Its the US version!!!!!! It works but not if you already have older *.mny files you want to contuinue to use"
,everettpf3,2008-08-16T18:55Z,This won't let me sign in. This won't let me do anything.
,Tehutihet,2008-08-19T01:37Z,Worked for me!  I'm still seeding this one.
,skykicker1976,2008-09-17T09:03Z,to work with this offline you have to decline the online privacy page
,bayonic,2008-09-26T23:02Z,this is not what u think it is....its a CD burning program!!!!!!! ITS NOT MICROSOFT MONEY
,skykicker1976,2008-10-19T19:12Z,"This Money 2007, bayonic you idoit, this is an iso so you have to burn it to a disk then load."
,skykicker1976,2008-12-28T02:09Z,or if you use winrar you can install without burning to a disk
,boomostik,2009-01-19T05:35Z,"WTF
I installed the program it updated it self and now everytime i click on something inside the program it just asks if i would like to open save or cancel some 1.5kb file called mny264.surfplace.

I googled it and nothing scanned with mcafee and avg nothing.

when i click on file it just runtime error crashes and closes.
WTF?"
