What would happen if the top 20 teams (from the top 10 FIFA
countries) all met in the English Premier League? Let's find out!

But wait you say! What about the 18 teams that didn't make
the top 2! I cut the numbers 3 to 20 out of equal sized pieces of
paper, threw them in a hat and did random draws. First team
drawn replaced the first team in that division. Second replaced the
second! (P.S. I used the 3 promoted clubs as 18 19 20).
