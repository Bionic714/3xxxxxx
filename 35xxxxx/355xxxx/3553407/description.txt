Pat & Mat is a classic Czech stop-motion animation series originally produced for Slovak TV, featuring two inept but imaginative neighbours in a Czech suburb, and following their disastrous attempts at DYI home improvement. Crispy photographed and sharply directed, the short, 7-minute episodes are surreal and often hilarious, and have been a cult hit all over Europe since the late 1970s. Stereo soundtrack, no dialogue.
