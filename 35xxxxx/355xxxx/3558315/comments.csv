,rdvenom,2006-11-16T21:19Z,This doesn't work for me.  It's all garbled sound with no video.  I tried playing with powerdvd on PC and burning and playing on home DVD player.

,Felfy,2006-11-17T19:51Z,"Hi All

I've tried re-compiling this DVD through DVD Shrink AND DVD Decrypter with no joy - still skips

The 'source' DVD info must be corrupt

Has anyone else got any more suggestions?
