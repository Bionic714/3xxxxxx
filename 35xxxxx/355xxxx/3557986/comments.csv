video converters are pretty common.  Just convert it to an mp4 file. i have the magic video converter and it works well for me.  just get it here on TPB."

,jarooko,2010-06-06T11:11Z,"This is the 2005 version?! Good thing i didn't dl it... I mean, the movie is hellishly bad. I understand the need of directors to load us with modern art movies and to copy their feelings in a movie, but boy, this on over did it."
,jarooko,2010-06-06T11:14Z,"No, wait... Hell, now i don't get anything... Is it the 2004 or the 2005 version?
Somebody says one thing, and then a few posts down somebody else says something else.
Hell, I'm just gonna dl it..."

,razzell2,2011-05-18T14:58Z,"Jeeze, all of those wasted posts could have been avoided if Maroo, the original uploader, would have put some kind of description in here. Maybe the stars names, a small synopsis. What does it take to copy and paste the synopsis into the description area?
Anyway, thanks Maroo. "
