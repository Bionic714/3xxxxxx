,yukonmaster,2006-11-26T07:51Z,"ockizzz; Your comment was unnecessary, if you don't like the band then why click on the torrent, and post your shit comments hoping that they will have the slightest influence on whether we download it or not, which really doesn't matter. We haven't criticized the bands which 'in your opinion are good' and left negative feedback so don't do that in ours!

Choke on that,
