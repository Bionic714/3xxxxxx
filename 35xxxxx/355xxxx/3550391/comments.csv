,seej,2006-11-03T19:05Z,"MattiP, what on earth are you talking about? This is a dvdr."
,speakeasy,2006-11-03T19:22Z,"Thanks deathmule.
Looks like a dvdr to me!
Though I s'pose it's also a TV show.
Maybe a new category should be created - 'DVDR TV Show'.
:-)"

ok sorry just looked at the size must be crappy quality then.""

i love people that see low bitrate and automaicly think its bad quality. have ever made a DVD before? have you even took the time to download any of my lost DVDs? these are great quality DVDs. the bitrate is low because it is ONE EPISODE. how about you download before you talk shit. i have not had one complaint of any of my LOST release. one more time for everone low bitrate DOES NOT mean its low quality or its not a DVD."
,Do!nK,2006-11-04T11:37Z,"these are quality rips hands down

,grendal,2006-11-07T22:58Z,"quality is amazing and the bit rate so low!! excellent to be able to down load and burn straight away. Thanks death mule. I also will be looking for your name on lost releases to download.  I dont have to convert the avi to dvd and better still your releases are in lip sync, I cant get mine conversions to do that using Nero vision.
Thanks again!"

Anyone who has the nerve to make negetive comments about the quality of these should take the time to sample the goods first!!!!!"
