Thanks a LOT"
,Arild23,2006-11-14T22:08Z,"How about giving out it out in a full dvd9?
That would be nice :)"
,Noffes,2006-11-14T22:35Z,"No problem in a few days you can find a full DVD9 in most stores.

With that I mean if you don't like what they seed then buy it but don't come here and complain."
,Fhat,2006-11-15T09:49Z,Some corrupt files that make this movie impossible to burn.
,Hellraiser5,2006-11-15T14:40Z,"I dont see the use of almost 100 rar.files to make an iso file that burns VOB files on a dvd.
Just put the freakin VOB files in the torrent , that saves evrybody a lot of time.
Thanx for the torrent ."
,Bigoload,2006-11-15T16:57Z,Damn i can se at it....its just a read and write file have do i do it so i can se at it??
,menvafanda,2006-11-15T22:01Z,"seed or something, the speed sux.... "
,thalia,2006-11-16T22:52Z,"takk denna er bra kvalitet :D 

god film men ikke like go som den første"
,TorrentMantra,2006-11-17T11:57Z,"Agree with Hellraiser5, especially if the image itself is smaller than the combined size of all the RAR chunks ! That doesn't mean to say we don't appreciate what's on offer :-)"
,wasa62,2006-11-17T22:11Z,fuck  fattas flera filer faan kan man läga ut denna
,Corrason,2006-11-18T16:33Z,"Är inte OK, ljudet funkar inte i filmen"
[V],mikohl,2006-11-19T07:40Z,"The point in releasing .rar files is just scene rules. There's many advantages in releasing in that format, for instance if a file is damaged you don't have to throw it all away, you just redownload the damaged file.  I could of course unpack it, but why the hell should I? If you're that damn lazy, then go buy the damn movie instead."
,Marie_Z,2006-11-19T13:52Z,"Varför fungerar inte ljudet????

Why doesn´t the sound works?????"
,dr.anonym,2006-11-20T23:02Z,Sound doesn't work in PowerDVD or my DVD-player. There is sound in the menu up until the movie starts. I tried choosing the audio track but there is just no sound. Is there a way to fix this so that I won't need to download another one?
,dr.anonym,2006-11-20T23:24Z,"The sound actually works in VLC-player. Though that does me no good, as I want to watch in on my DVD-player. I am going to try to edit the DVD to see if I can fix it. Goddamn amateur shit."
,dr.anonym,2006-11-21T04:13Z,"Found out that my DVD-player doesn't support DTS, neither does the PowerDVD that I have. VLC has the DTS-plugin. This release is still rather fucked in my opinion."
,mr_blackpt,2006-11-21T14:47Z,Why do not have the Portuguese subtitle ???
,tsgj1872,2006-11-21T18:47Z,How do I put all the files in one?
,mondeo98,2008-06-17T14:29Z,"Thats it, I GIVE UP. STOPPED AT 94.6% LAME !!!

MIKOHL, Check ya Torrents !"
,leonnis16,2012-09-04T16:00Z,"Please upload it with romanian subtitle !!!
