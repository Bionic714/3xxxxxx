Works for iTunes 7.1 only!

The patch adds some of the good old User Interface that vanished in iTunes 7.
APPLE!!!!!

Buttons are put at the top of the main window.
- Library
- Equalizer
- Video
- Settings
- Store
etc.

How to:
1. Make copy of existing iTunes.exe (7.1)
2. Run the patch, and locate copy of iTunes.exe
3. Try it out
4. Applause :-)

If you dont like the patch, simply revert back to the original iTunes.exe.
