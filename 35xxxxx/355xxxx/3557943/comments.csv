,meer.station,2006-11-26T12:31Z,This isn't burnout for pc :< omg a waste of bandwidth
,Lynium,2007-01-29T08:07Z,"*looks at mere.station stupidly....*

its the OST- as in Official Sound Track
its the sound track for the game, not the game itself...
that would have to be some pretty good compression to stuff an entire dvd based game into 196.52 mb.... lmao

some people... ugh!"
,Doddy83,2008-06-15T16:58Z,"innit, 3 reasons why you're stupid enough to waste your bandwidth:

1) 196.52MiB - Not even the best compression tools can pack a game that small

2) Can't you read? OST (Official SOUND Track)

3) Again, can't you read, every bittorrent client tells you what you're downloading BEFORE you ""waste your bandwidth""

It's n00bs like you who get sites like these watched by the authorities."
,Doddy83,2008-06-15T16:59Z,"oh and its spelt mier, btw"

,XdanneX1,2009-01-24T19:12Z,Thx!!! :D:D:D
,Lynium,2009-12-21T02:54Z,"2 yrs later, and still some of the best dang songs around, and yeah, Im STILL sharing this...
Even though theres been times when I've been without internet.. Im actualy re-downloading it atm as I wiped my HD for certain reasons. I am re-downloading it now to share once more! I love nothing better than to take off and rip down the trails and around the gravel and sand pits on my quad (LTR 450) while pumping these tunes into my brain via the ear ports! lol Enjoy everyone!"
,Gman-wins,2010-03-20T08:52Z,"this is arguably the best Burnout soundtrack ever! every game after this just cannot consistently match B3. dominator being the worst me thinks with 3 versions of that awful avril lavigne song..... ugh!

nice one dude! "
,terkoiz,2010-07-28T20:19Z,"I've noticed alot of crackling on some tracks. I tried playing on multiple computers, cdplayers, and my ipod so i dont think its a problem with my hardware. Just a fair warning to people. Its very noticeable loud in my truck..."
