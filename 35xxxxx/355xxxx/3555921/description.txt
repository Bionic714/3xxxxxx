Synopsis
James Cameron, the Academy Award┬«-winning director of "Titanic", presents this groundbreaking cinematic achievement. Joined by his personal friend Bill Paxton and a team of the world┬┤s foremost history and marine experts, Cameron journeys back to the site of his greatest inspiration -- the legendary wreck of the Titanic. During the voyage, you will explore the entire ship, deck by deck and room by room, encountering mysteries that have remained hidden for almost a century. Revolutionary underwater robots were designed and built solely for the purpose of allowing the explorers to peer deep into the remains of the once great ship and bring those surreal and haunting images back to the surface..
