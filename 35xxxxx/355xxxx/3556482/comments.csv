,olan_b,2006-11-14T13:26Z,"could someone give me a run though on how to use this key gen? Whats the ""Let me know your request first,then Press GenBtn to get your Serial!"" bit all about? Something to do with telephone activation code?"
,olan_b,2006-11-14T15:00Z,"This is what i got off another site, but still can't get it to work! Anyone got any better suggestions? Seems simple enough... But once i get the activation number and enter it into the text field and click generate it gives me two new numbers - is the top the NEW serial and the bottom one the activation code?

,prince12,2006-11-24T17:43Z,"Hello!
Wich program do U need to open all of the files, i am using both Deamon Tools and Alcohol 120, but i really dont know how to open it.  just tell me what program to use and a short description..Tanks!"
[V],olingskoG,2006-11-24T23:08Z,"prince12..

It works just fine to use Deamon Tools, you may need to chose ""all files"" when you are in the program looking for the file."
,xxxx4,2006-11-26T07:57Z,"Help Please!

When I initially got this release I didn?t have any instructions with the gen. I got it installed with a serial from the keygen and thought I had it activated, but a couple days later a dialogue box came up wanting me to activate it and saying I had only 5 days left. Use of the keygen at that point failed and I thought it might be due to no longer having the serial I originally installed with in the keygen. I then uninstalled it and tried reinstalling using the instructions above. Even then if I use a new serial from the keygen and then try activating it, I get an error saying it was an bad activation number. I noticed at that point that the type of installation it was trying to do was a ?repair? installation. I guess that is different than an upgrade or a new one. I thought shit, I?m f*cked. So I uninstalled again and cleaned the registry of everything I could determine was associated with acrobat. At the next installation attempt, it again failed and said that I now had 4 days left and was still a ?repair? installation. The keygen worked no better than before.

So, it appears that once installed and failing activation the program gives you 5 grace days to use it before you have to activate. Obviously there is a registry key that I can?t find that contains the installation information. I can?t reinstall using the keygen until I can wipe the info out of the registry.

I?ve done searches through the registry for ?acrobat? but it seems useless. I?ve also tried one of those uninstallers that analyzes an installation. I?ve searched the newsgroups for posts talking about this and also the web. You?re the closest to a discussion I can find.

I really need to get this installed. Does anyone have any ideas?"

2. Use SeriaL:111810261991678560422846. 
3. Start program after installation.
4. Start Destiller and close after font scanning.
5. Start Validation.
6. Cancel Validation and close Acrobat.
7. Copy files in ""Crack"" Direcotry TO ...\Adobe\Acrobat 8\Acrobat\
8. Now printing PDF's, Destiller and all works (for me).
9. Enjoy"
,goldanthrowolf,2006-12-07T05:57Z,"Well I'm not complaining.. mostly...

I got it unpacked, and the umpteen stupid RAR files.. *ugg* The point of doing all the .rar files for a .bin/.cue is pointless beyond imagination... anywho..

I went and loaded it with the latest Daemon Tools, after tweaking a few things, cause the original archinve was not openable by WinRAR 3.60 *shrug* So I got 3.62, opened fine.

I mounted, started ot install, then half way throuhg it threw a tantrum about a file, and I tried it twice, and it will not 'correct' so either Daemon tools is reading the ISO wrong (which I doubt) or the archive is just flubbed, and I'll have to download it.. again..

Any suggestions?"

,merc_fan,2006-12-30T21:13Z,"Works fine on my PC but when I started the installation on my other PC, it'd say that it couldn't find a previous version of Acrobat?

This was after I put in a serial from the Keygen, I tried about 10 serials and all said the same thing. Also, this was on a brand new copy of Windows.

So I installed Acrobat 7 and then started the installation for Acrobat 8 and it recognised 7 was there so it removed it and installed 8.

,umbepo,2007-04-30T21:56Z,"OK, I think their is a problem for people who don't have an existing version of Acrobat Pro. I am currently downloading 7 pro, I will install it then install 8 pro and let you know how it works..."
,umbepo,2007-05-01T11:01Z,"Success! 

OK! Here's the problem: this version of Acrobat has to have a previous version of Acrobat installed and activated before you can install it. 

Solution: Install Acrobat 7 Pro, then install Acrobat 8 Pro. Not exactly ideal, but it works.

http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3446809/Adobe_Acrobat_7.0___Keygen

I used that one. Download and install, keygen is included and working. 

Once you have installed 7, install 8 with a serial from the keygen (can't remember if it was the first or second, do some exploring). During installation I got an error, just press ignore, it worked fine for me.

Now, activate by phone and use the keygen."
