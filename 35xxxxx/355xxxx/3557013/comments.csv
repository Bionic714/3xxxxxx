,heman69,2006-12-19T10:40Z,"I have the European Version with Star Force Protection, and this crack works fine for me!!

Install the game and patch it with the fixed 1.2 Patch that's in this download! A detailed Instruction comes with the download. Make sure you DON'T HAVE the official 1.2 Patch installed, because if you have, this crack will not work!!

,charafos,2007-01-16T18:42Z,hi guys can someone help. It doesnt work for me. Should it be daemon tool ver 4.06 or any version.

4. OS tested: xp sp2 ,w2k sp4
