Slightly related to the Doom video game series by id Software, Doom is a action/horror movie where a group of marines are sent to a UAC facility on Mars where strange shit is happening.  Unlike the Hell-related themes of Doom games, this movie deals with a Resident Evil-like genetic manipulation issue causing the demonic behaviour.

This release is a high-quality XviD/AC3/Matroska release by me, Junx.  Video is encoded at an average of 987.0 kbps, audio is encoded at a static 448 kbps (straight rip from DVD), and the mkv file contains a chapter list for easy navigation.

If you are unable to play this movie, check out VLC <http://videolan.org/vlc/>.
