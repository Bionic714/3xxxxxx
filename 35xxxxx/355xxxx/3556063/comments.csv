,Maclain,2006-11-21T08:43Z,"thanks for the upload :-)

Will you be uploading disc 2 when you have it available?

I dont actually watch lost, but it's for a friend who doesnt have sky.

P.S when you complete the download PELASE leave the terrent running and seed the file!! 3kB/s ETA 512 hours!! :-("
,paul1568,2006-11-21T10:56Z,"Disc 2 will probably be available around the end of March 2007 and I will be encoding and uploading it.
Have been seeding this one for 7 days, but have also had connection problems. I think maybe a few leechers hitting and running. Will seed for another week or so.

Thanks for the comment."
,minetka,2006-11-26T19:54Z,"Great download! It took a while to pull down the whole thing, but it was completely worth the wait. Nice episode menu, good commercial expurgating, great quality, super easy to burn to dvd.  Thank you!  "
,paul1568,2006-11-27T10:20Z,"No problem, thanks for your kind comments. Will be posting Disc 2 when available."
,dizziestduck,2006-12-02T17:39Z,"Brilliant download! Did take some time, but burnt to disc very easily.  I left it to seed for a while as well.

Roll on disc 2 please!"
,DeadlyDrizzt,2006-12-28T03:57Z,"You've saved my life brother!
Just finished watching the first 2 seasons on DVD, totally hooked....

I was flippin' out over weather to watch the rest of season 3(without watching the first 6) or waiting 'til summer for the DVD's.... 

and, like I said, you've saved my life!(well not literally, of course, but youve certainly freed me from the endless torments of new episode deprivation. Maybe it could be called N.E.D.)

Thanks a million! I will continue to seed for all of my fellow Lost Addicted Friends...(L.A.F.s ???)"
