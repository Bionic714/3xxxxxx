,N-doe,2006-11-12T17:06Z,Why can't you rip the files so that each disc is just one file with the chapters coded correctly? 332 mp3 files are just a pain in the ass to keep track of.
,Turbonegro,2007-02-27T19:59Z,"thanks for the book
but why is there ""mumbling"" in the background
is it recorded in a public toilet ?"
,Viddeliten,2007-09-12T10:12Z,"N-doe, because I like it this way. My MP3-player will like it too... =)"

Aha, perfekt. Ska anteckna det."
,deadrising,2008-01-01T01:30Z,"These files are a mess.  Over 300 files for one book?  How about one chaptered file for one book?  I can't even tell where the chapters are on this thing, it's like if you lose your place you're just stuck.  Especially for a 50 some hour book, this is just a mess."
,w000ter,2008-05-20T10:27Z,"well,... its a long book!
get a better mp3 player"
