,xmaniak,2006-11-05T10:18Z,"Hi this is how to solve the problem for all (where a black screen hangs when the game is loading):

1. Install Offical Patch: (included in this torrent)

http://www.hollowbomb.com/html/sshock2/shkpatch.exe

2. Add The Windows XP Fixx: (included in this torrent)

http://www.hollowbomb.com/html/sshock2/shock2_xp_2000_fix.zip

3. Do this:

You will need to edit the shock.cfg file in the System Shock 2 folder on the hard drive. Open the shock.cfg file with notepad, and add the text ""safe_texture_manager"" on a line of its own. This change will become active when the file is saved.

And it should run fine"
,Gestalt,2006-11-05T21:27Z,"great game. i have some of these, but not all, so it'll be interesting to check them out. thanks!"
,koshman,2006-11-05T21:43Z,"Yeah, one of the best games ever. The mod with better enemies has never worked me unfortunately (well, it has, I just couldnt see the monkeys..... aaaaahh, the monkeyyyyyys, they still haunt my dreamsssssss......)"
,Kolya_,2006-11-06T04:19Z,"All of these mods (and more) are available as free downloads, including installation instructions written by me here:

http://www.strangebedfellows.de 

No registration needed or any BS. Anyone can just pick the mods they like and download them easily (and much faster than this torrent).

And this is obviously where you downloaded them too, xmaniak. So I wonder how you managed to ""spend 5 hours finding them""...?

Also a few of these mod authors have made it clear that they don't want their works used in mod packs. 
You disregard their legal rights AND trick piratebay's users for no good reason but to blow your own horn. That's pretty low imo."
,xmaniak,2006-11-06T04:45Z,Fuck u dude i had no idea that site existed. I got most of these mods elswhere fuckface. Oh and i never made a damn mod package all files are in tact and are all separate files u moron think before u speak. And if you read the readme it clealy states this is a compilation just like u have on your fucking site. U are a fucking hypocrite so imho u need to shut the FUCK up. and mind your own business. If ppl want to use my torrent then let them you cant stop them. Just like i cant stop them from going to your site you just want to advertise ur fucking site so piss off. (MOD PACK MY ASS)
,xmaniak,2006-11-06T04:48Z,Oh P to the FUCKING S bitch : I am hosting these mods same as u.
,Kolya_,2006-11-06T04:58Z,"""i had no idea that site existed. I got most of these mods elswhere""

Try to decide on your story."
,xmaniak,2006-11-06T05:00Z,U dont own the rights to host these mods on just your site.
,xmaniak,2006-11-06T05:08Z,ur an idiot let these ppl do what they want and try not to be a damn dictator and control what ppl do. this is a stupid argument. This is a great game and i am trying to keep it alive.
,Gestalt,2006-11-06T09:26Z,"Kolya_, your pathetic rant just makes me want to say away from your site forever. i already had 7 of these files and I've never heard of the site. "
,Gestalt,2006-11-06T09:27Z,*stay away*
,Gestalt,2006-11-06T09:31Z,"also, who is really ""blowing his own horn"" here. jeez..."
,Kolya_,2006-11-06T16:26Z,"Yes, stay away sockpuppet. As far as you can."
,mbala2,2006-11-06T19:34Z,"Tnx for those :D
I had forgot about this game, and didnt know there was a modding community. Dont listen to the whining. Its allways a good thing to promote good old games, so that new ppl can play them. Especially when there are a community out there.."
