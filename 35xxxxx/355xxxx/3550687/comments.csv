,Bhador,2006-11-03T19:22Z,Yes. it works great.. for me anyway.. so now i can play this game.
,BionicBear,2006-11-03T22:50Z,"to bad no one downloaded it, so u cant say it works"
,the_inquisition,2006-11-04T03:19Z,Utterly pointless since you need the 80 meg patch to 1.01  to play the game without being bugged to death. 
,kad153,2006-11-05T17:49Z,"Few questions:

If you patch to 1.01, does the crack no longer work?

If yes, anyone know when a 1.01 crack is coming?"
,areskamui,2006-11-05T20:46Z,Hi if u looking for tools for Nevewinter nights 2 like no-cd crack trainer or keygen have look on .... www.neweni2.szm.sk ... enjoy :)
,Balt,2006-11-06T21:03Z,"Okay here's how this works:

First off, it DOES work with the PROCYON release, which is nice :)
Second off, it also DOES work with the 1.01 update.
Here's how it's done if u don't know. Install Neverwinter Nights 2 and after the install, doubleclick the desktop shortcut (or whereever u have it), choose Update and press Update once again.
This will start a 80mb DL and the game will update itself from the DL'ed file afterwards. When it's done, just do like u normally would crack a game, copy the ""nwn2main.exe"" and ""nwn2main_amdxp.exe"" into the NWN2 folder.

The reason that the crack shouldn't be applied before the update, is that the updater validates checksum of the files, and finds the 2 .exe files to be invalid 3rd party executables. Thus stopping and uninstalling the update. From here its a good idea to have the original .exe files, else it's a clean reinstall :)

Hope u can this to work, in my oppinion its a piece of cake, but i know i've had probs when others didn't. Ask if u got any questions."
,Balt,2006-11-06T21:06Z,"Oh another thing. And this I must say is for the REALLY new crack-users. When copying the 2 .exe files from this download into the NWN 2 folder, u have to CLICK YES to OVERWRITE the existing files...
Peace out! :P"
,Tuzikas,2006-11-07T00:37Z,I try out versions 1.0 and 1.01.But geting always the same problem.Exe error.Some one geting the same? How to fix it?
,Balt,2006-11-07T08:49Z,"Tuzikas: U have to give a bit more information than that.

What does the .exe error message say precisely (I know it sux to write it all in, but it's worth it)? What did u install the game from? - If it's a download add release info (e.g. PROCYON / Reloaded release).
What cd'key did u use (DO NOT WRITE IT IF U BOUGHT THE GAME!)? Personally I used this one: DKQC4-U466M-E4CYU-TDGJ7-CYMEH-TF7H6-3MKMN
I take it that ur updater updated itself to v.1.03 and then updated the game to v.1.01? That's what mine did anyway. And u did overwrite the ""nwn2main.exe"" and ""nwn2main_amdxp.exe"" files after ur update?
Last off: What specs do u have? This would include Ghz, RAM, Harddisk space, and Gfx card RAM. If this is too requiring just info about the OS ur using (e.g. Windows XP Home SwedishVersion).
Hope we can figure out this little prob of urs, cuz the game looks sweet altho i haven't tried it yet :)"
,Tuzikas,2006-11-07T12:10Z,"hi.It says:Nwn has encountered  a problem and has to close.
AppName: nwn2main.exe,ApName nwn2main.exe,ApVer.1.0.0.0 modVer.1.0.0.0 and so on.
Its from 1.00 version.From 1.01 is the same.
I using Procion vers. and have same cd key.
And updater did the same as yours:) and overwrite those exe to.
I using notebook Fj.Siemens 1,7Ghz,1Gb RAM,80 hard,128mb Ati mobility video,Xp Home (english).
ah,I mounting it with Dm 4.06.
Maybe I need to try Prostop....."
,polar21,2006-11-07T15:06Z,Have the same problem!
,Sture_Ture,2006-11-07T23:15Z,"Game performs much better after update (1.01)

If you need original files 

nwn2main.exe
nwn2main_amdxp.exe 

for a clean update they can be found in the ""Root"" directory in the NWN2 DVD.

Had a lot of game crashes before I updated.
Now it works swell :)"
,Balt,2006-11-08T08:29Z,"Tuzikas/polar21:
Hmm this is annoying... To install the game I used DaemonTools v.4.03 (HE), cuz I've forgotten to update it for quite some time :) Anyway, the version of the virtual drive doesn't matter, because it's not used to emulate the cd afterwards. This is basically Mount->Install->Unmount->Crack, so the D-Tools version shouldn't have any impact.
I checked to see if perhaps the system requirements were too great to be run on ur labtop, and I think that might be a problem in the end.

Recommended:
3 Ghz Intel Pentium 4 or equivalent processor
1 GB System RAM
ATI X800 series, NVIDIA GeForce 6800 series, 256 MB, or higher video card
Minimum System Requirements:
Windows XP, Windows 2000
512MB System RAM
2.4 Ghz Intel Pentium 4 or equivalent processor
Hard Disk Space: 4.9 GB free hard disk space
128MB Direct3D compatible video card and DirectX 9.0 compatible driver

Nontheless u should be able to start the game at least, so we won't worry about this just yet :)

Okay guys, think I found the problem and it doesn't look pretty :/
Check out this forum thread: http://nwn2forums.bioware.com/forums/viewtopic.html?topic=511840&forum=116
A lot of ppl have startup crashes, which apprently haven't been fixed yet by either Obsidian or Atari. Think u guys should keep a look at that thread, that's prob ur best chance of getting the damn game to work :(

If anyone else knows any useful information, it would be great if u posted it.

Sture_Ture:
Well a ""clean update"" is the only option there is so far, since Obsidian haven't released a stand-alone update.exe file yet :) But the DVD\root info was great, beats my advice of reinstalling a lot =)
I heard that the 1.01 update was crucial to play the game, that they, like more and more Atari games, gets released with quite a few bugs. One last thing, ""swell""? U have to be kidding me, that word is so damn old that ppl don't use it anymore, why not just write cool/neat/nice/great/ejaculated/awesome or whatever? =P"
,polar21,2006-11-08T10:05Z,"Balt
Thanks for the info and it seems that i'll be waiting a while before Atari comes to the rescue.
Crack you later

,Tuzikas,2006-11-08T10:49Z,"thanks,I bit busy now,so no wory a lot about that game.Maybe next week:)"
,Balt,2006-11-08T19:19Z,"No problems mates, just hope it gave u some of the answers u were looking for. I know how annoying it is when u got some probs u can't take care of urself, so whenever I can help, I try to.
Oh and I completely forgot, thx for the download Ekkimus, I think I can speak for all of us when I say: We appreciate it a lot :)"
,Sture_Ture,2006-11-08T19:45Z,"Thx for all the info Balt, good job.

You're a swell guy :)"
,Tuzikas,2006-11-09T10:27Z,"Thanks for info,but I dont think its gonna work.PPl there have problems more with loading CD/DVD.And as long as I now,exe problems never going to do sumthimg with protection.Maybe I wrong...Anyway,if some one had the same problem and manage to work out,please share  with us:)"
,Balt,2006-11-09T19:51Z,"Sture: God u should be hanged for abusing that word! :P

Tuzi: As far as I read, they had about the same probs as u. If u suspect it to be a CD/DVD error or something software/protection related, I suggest u try to install and run it on another comp, to check. If u haven't got more than one, I'm sure u got a friend u could abuse =) Altho I think it's ur system specs, but that's nothing but a wild guess.

Everyone: I don't know if anyone has had a problem with gaming LAN, but the other day when me and my girlfriend wanted to game, it said we needed different cd-keys. Just like NWN1 duuuh >.< The PROCYON release only gives 1 cd-key, which sux. But I managed to get additional keys from The Reloaded release so here they are:
WE999-ARE99-RLD99-L33T9-AD9VD-K6AGU-DVGEE
GREAT-GREAT-GREAT-GREAT-GPE3T-6REA4-GVEXT
RLD33-RLD33-RLD33-RLD33-R6DK3-KLA39-RADJ3
99999-99999-99999-99999-9E9E9-99Q9K-9P9Q9

I've only tried the buttom one, and that works fine. When applieng the key, just change it in the ""nwncdkey.ini"" found in the game directory.
When pressing multiplayer it wants u to log in, if u haven't got a login from NWN1 u can simply unplug ur netcable, write something like Username: AssCrack; Password: BallSucker or whatever takes ur fancy :P
The game will tell u that u are unable to connect to internet games, click okay. Now u can game on LAN with ur buddies, and plug in ur netcable if u wanna go back online on MSN Messenger, search for pr0n or simply just log into thepiratebay.org to tell Sture what a swell guy he is xD

Hope someone uses this info, cuz it took me like 5-10 minutes to write :P"

,Tactical__,2006-12-17T11:24Z,"I have serious problems with this.

No matter what I try... Now I downloaded the older clone cd thing from GCW and mounted it with Daemon Tools 4.06, and once again I get this:

""A required security module can not be activated. This program can not be executed.""

Note that this isn't because it detects the emulation, then it would just say ""Emulation detected!"" (like it did when I mounted with Alcohol 120%. When I ran sd4hide.exe it didn't detect the emulation but said this same error message instead). I haven't even updated the game yet, so you'd think it would run... But no.

But when I mount this ( http://m0006.gamecopyworld.com/games/pc_neverwinter_nights_2.shtml#Neverwinter%20Nights%202%20[MULTI4]%20No-DVD/Fixed%20Image%201 ) with DT 4.06 I don't even need pr0t.st0p or sd4hide.exe, it doesn't detect the emulation but just gives this:

""A required security module can not be activated. This program can not be executed.""

What's up with this? What causes it?? :("
,arparparp,2006-12-19T21:59Z,Got damn! Give 1.02 crack now!
