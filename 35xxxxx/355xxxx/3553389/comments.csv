,crg7,2007-04-18T20:38Z,"I cannot apply the NoDVD patch... when I select the Sims 2 app file, it says that it cannot be applied to the file. Help, please!"
,crustythebird,2007-04-29T10:33Z,"Okay I figured out the prob... this also works for the Pets patch:

The patcher program has trouble reseting permissions. From the install CD the ""The Sims 2"" program is set to ""read only"". You need to right click on the file and set permissions to ""read & write"" for you and then right click on the file again, ""show package contents"", go to contents/mac os , and right click on ""the sims 2"". (that program will have a little icon that looks like a terminal) set the permissions on there to ""read & write"". Now the patcher will work. 

If you downloaded all of the expansions don't do this until you install Pet's and then just patch Pets. It saves time. Also if you actually own pets you don't have to patch any of the other expansions you download. Whatever is the most recent expansion you install is the only one you must own or patch and the order is: University,Night Life, Business, Pets."

,LanaSB,2008-01-15T05:34Z,"Please advise what I should be doing with the crack? I am new to using a Mac. I put it in the same folder where I have the sims2.app. If I try to open the crack, it crashes, like the previous poster described it. If I try to run the original app from the same folder, it keeps asking for the CD. I'm on leopard. Any help will be greatly appreciated!"
,Nuggler,2008-01-22T01:49Z,"the patcher crashes in leopard.
helpz???
"
,joeab,2008-01-27T15:53Z,"Ok.... 


in leopard, you have to run the patcher using rosetta, (ctrl click, get info, open using rosetta) 

Then you have to set the admin to read/wright privelges on the two files inside the app 

Those files are Info.plist (contents/Info.plist) and the sims 2 (contents/macos/the sims 2)

You do this by ctrl clicking, get info then under sharing and permissions, click the padlock and then change admin to read wright

Though then you run into another problem.... the patcher throws up a coupple of SHA1 errors... and i dont know how to fix these... but give it a go anyway... you may have more luck than me :D"
,trinja,2008-03-11T06:26Z,has anybody gotten this to work? I've run the patch changed the permissions but I'm still being prompted for a cd :(
