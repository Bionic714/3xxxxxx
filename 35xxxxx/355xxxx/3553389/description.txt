Sims 2 Open for Business Expansion pack with a matched No CD/DVD patch.

If you do not run the patch, then it won\\\'t allow the expansion pack to play on Sims 2  without giving you an error asking for you to load disc

While this should install in most Mac OS X systems without incident, understand that it will ask for change in permissions while the patch is installing and that you should keep a backup copy of your previous Sims 2 settings and saved games from your user/Documents/EA games in case you need to do a clean reinstall of Sims 2.

Please use with caution and enjoy..........
