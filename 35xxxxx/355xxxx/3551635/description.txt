?Forgiveness?
I 
I?m a roamer in time
I travel alone 
Throughout an endless journey

Home 
Where is my home
Fragments of a love life 
I won?t surrender

When the spirits are calling my name
Then I will have passed all the sorrow and pain
And I?ll go to heaven with you
I?ll lay down my head on your pillow and ask for forgiveness


Enjoy
