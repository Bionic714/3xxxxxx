,GnattyBrattyPants,2006-11-16T20:10Z,"'RE' stands for 'retarded'.    Relentlesstech you asshole, change your name to 'Retardedtech'.   This torrent is completely and utterly useless.   DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!!    DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME!    We need to identify the fucktards that upload this bullshit so that this doesn't happen again.   Relentlesstech is the biggest asshole on here right now.   What a fucking idiot.   "
,GnattyBrattyPants,2006-11-16T20:48Z,"Search TPB for Bluescan's FSX package.   Yep, it'll take you another couple of weeks but it's a good upload.    Asshole extraordinaire Relentlesstech didn't repackage a damn thing, he merely stuffed together someone else's previous upload and stuck Razor1911's original crack into a untested, corrupted .iso, then tried to take the credit for 'cracking' it himself.     Lesson learned, don't EVER download unless there are multiple, confirmed installation successes.   The guy who posted on here earlier with the corrupted .cab file tried to warn us but we didn't listen.  "
,monstert,2006-11-16T23:08Z,"hmm looks like this torrent is fucked then.
Its a shame the the rest of the 46+ people that have downloaded this cant make a comment if their download worked or not. Nvm
Think its gave me a massive insentive to go and buy the copy now lol haha"
,pieter1983,2006-11-16T23:40Z,"After I downloaded and installed this there was no FSX.exe file to be found anywhere. Re-installed it twice, same problem. So I'm just going to have a look around to see if there are any other, more successfully installable torrents available."
,JorgeWBush,2006-11-17T00:25Z,"Ok, I just copied everything from the .iso image files to a directory on my hard drive - same corrupt .cab file error as before.    Gotta agree with GnattyPants that you are a FUCKING ASSHOLE  'Relentlesstech'.      Your goddamn upload is chocked full of errors all over the place.   You ever think of checking your CRC's before you put a 8 gig torrent up???    THIS TORRENT IS COMPLETELY FUCKED DON'T DOWNLOAD (unless you just like wasting about a week of your time).  "
,JorgeWBush,2006-11-17T00:41Z,"I've just run several utilities to do some extensive diagnostics and they've all found  corruption in several of the .cab files included in dumbass Relentlesstech's torrent here.   ONCE AGAIN, THIS TORRENT IS FUCKED AND CANNOT BE FIXED.    Sorry, there is no hope.    "
,monstert,2006-11-17T01:52Z,"fuck it, cancelled. I'm going to buy this game now..might as well lol. Thanks anyway guys"
,GnattyBrattyPants,2006-11-17T02:20Z,"Sorry for my earlier rant everyone.   It's understandable when someone takes the time to make a huge upload and accidently makes a mistake.    What really caused me to go ballistic is that this torrent's author, RelentlessTech, claimed this was a pre-cracked install.   He lied about that for starters - this is a direct clone of FSX with no alteration whatsoever.    Secondedly as was mentioned, this guy didn't make the slightest effort to check the integrity of his .iso files and caused hundreds of us to download this crap for nothing.    Thirdly, he most likely copied his torrent from Bluescan's original, then try to claim he had 'repackaged' a cracked installer.   Total bullshit.    Anyways, onwards and upwards.    We need to verify crap before downloading is all.  "
,sodas,2006-11-17T17:14Z,"not al hove is lost i just did some basic checking and if you have a full copy of this torrent (or at least disk 1) just rename the ISO to Bluescan's FSX torrent and recheck the files you will see that disk one is about .2% diffrent from this torrent, and if my simple solution works i just saved me 4.7 gigs of waiting, alltho disk 2 seamed to be fucked so youl need to get that one completely, this will work ive done it many times before with video and mp3s when i had a MFT fuck up and about 30,000 files had thier adress rearanged, i ws able to recover about 90% through torrent file CRC checking."
,GnattyBrattyPants,2006-11-17T19:23Z,"Sodas,

The reason Retardedtech's torrent here matches Bluescans so closely is that they are one and the same .iso's, trust me.   Retard simply repacked the Bluescan torrent (and screwed it up in the process), so that he could take credit for 'cracking'.    The only crack Retardedtech included is an apparent FSX 'no Cd' crack.   Great!   Errrr, except that FSX doesn't have a CD verify copy protection scheme whatsoever.     This is the reason one has to activate an uncracked version of FSX.    Retardedtech is full of bullshit in other words, trying to pawn himself off as a master hacker/cracker, but all he is doing is screwing everyone on this torrent with his fucked up repackaged Bluescan torrent.    If you are successful with your methods, hats off.   But I've just run Advanced CAB repair tool on this and found multiple corrupted files (corrupted during the image-making process by Retardedtech).    I've already erase this crap and won't waste anymore time.    Good luck though, I hope you are able to pull of your technique.    "
,GnattyBrattyPants,2006-11-20T21:45Z,"For any unfortunate souls who have tried to get this torrent to install correctly, read the above.   :)   If you want one that actually works, download Bluescan's FSX torrent here:

http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3535214/Flightsimulator_X_Deluxe_-_FSX_Delux

Next, simply download Razor's quick and easy no activation crack here and install to FSX's main directory:

http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3543431/razor_1911_3_dll_microsoft_flight_sim_crack.rar

Mount Bluescan's .iso images via a UDF compatible virutal CD device (Microsoft's free virtual CD toolbox download works great), install, then drop Razor's cracked .dlls into the FSX main install directory, overwriting the originals.    After this, you have a perfect working copy of FSX Deluxe.   Enjoy and watch out for any uploads by 'Relentlesstech' in the future.   This guy is full of crap.   Happy flying!"

WOOT it VERKS disk one installed with the .2% that i downloaded form bluescans torrent

kick-ass

fuckin relentless you stupid fuck .2% corrupt such a small fuckin margin to screw up on idiot."
,GnattyBrattyPants,2006-11-21T08:20Z,"Sodas, could you explain again how you did this (the CRC checking thing) - I've already downloaded Bluescan's complete torrent but I'd like to know your technique for future reference.   Thanks a lot, I'm glad you got yours working!"
,sodas,2006-11-23T07:29Z,"GnattyBrattyPants

shure its fairly simple, youll need to first find a torrent that is the same rip/copy as the one your trying to get,(iso are the most common, mp3s are not a good idea sence diffrent encode means diffrent CRCs) so stick to images of what your getting, 
now heres the fun, once you find the torrent that has a verry similar file strcture,(exact copy but diffrent file name) rename the file to the new torrent your going to continue from.
then using your torrent applacation,(i use utorrent, but any other is fine) start the torrent then redriect the torrent to the files you renamed.
after that either the app shuld auto check the crc for you, if not refer to the manual to find the option, and thats it .

trust me its not very hard at all, but this realy works only with data that comes from a standrad medium, like cd/dvd images, sence the informatioon shuld be an exact copy of any other, so it dosent mater who riped it it shuld always be the same. altho my sitiuation was more drastic sience my files got mixed up every where,(ie i play a mp3 a clip fom a movie plays, thats bad verry bad.) but i lived through it. i hope you can use this to save your ass, or get a complete torrent you have half downloaed from a now dead torrent and splice it with a live one, thats really what this is good for. good luck "
,Juvetti,2006-12-02T05:04Z,i cant find a key for this game can you please help me ???
,salad fingers,2006-12-17T20:39Z,"Do not download, read other comments first!!

Relentlesstech has made a half assed attempt at repacking someone elses cracked version in order to claim the glory but in doing this he has fucked it up. It's such a piss poor job you would think that it was on purpose...........

Anyway if like me you downloaded the whole thing before finding this out then all is not lost, I was able to recover the first 4GB disc using Sodas technique."
