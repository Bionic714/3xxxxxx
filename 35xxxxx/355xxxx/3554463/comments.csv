?!? huh? how did that happen ?, It's not my rip but it was ok for me. anyone else having this problem?

aaahh, ok perhaps it's cause its a 900mb file right, so it will not fit on a cd. If you are burning it use a DVD or split it and put on 2 cds. Can you test it on your computer and see if it is ok?


I'm surprised that your burning software didn't alert you to that fact, maybe you don't have that feature or it's not set correctly.


A bad case of ""it doesn't work for me so it must be broken"" :roll: ... plz check more carefully before reporting errors - thx

,karmaseed,2007-06-27T17:42Z,"Is this the old english dub or the newer one?  Is Leonardo from Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles the voice of Kaneda?  That is in the original english dub.

also, any word on quality of picture and sound?"
,Raioh,2008-02-17T07:28Z,This is the Pioneer dub. It does NOT have voices by Cam Clarke and Jay Rabson. This was the RE-DUB from 2001. Please change the torrent title.
,Kyur4,2008-03-13T22:37Z,that was.... it was... that was the BEST MOVIE EVER!!!!!!
,VictorDTarsus,2008-04-11T10:14Z,"Holy shit! I damn near almost forgot how fucking awesome this movie was! I have the DVD around my dump of house. When ya can't find the DVD, Torrent it!"
,Nietzsche84,2008-06-23T04:13Z,I can confirm that the end is NOT missing.

,grabben83,2008-10-02T00:14Z,Bland dom bästa filmer som gjorts trots att den är så gammal! Även om man inte gillar animé så är den värd att se. Den är helt enkelt grym!!

,Arg_the_pirate,2009-09-24T23:36Z,"Great torrent! I love this movie.


By the way, Streamline dub is terrible in my opinion. Pioneer for the win."
,wulture,2009-10-09T21:38Z,"Just started downloading, good dl speed! 

Is this movie any good?"
,sideshow1176,2009-10-23T13:31Z,"It is a sad day when people get excited over a movie originally done in the Japanese lannguage, then dubbed into english, and then dubbed yet again into english. DO YOU WANT TO TRULY EXPERIENCE AKIRA??  learn to speak Japanese and watch the og. failing that--find the og w/ eng subtitles--not dubbed!! us americans are so stooopid!!"
,tibstah,2009-10-23T16:13Z,"To everyone complaining about the English dub:

Stop being a self-important twat. Only 0.02% of the world?s population speak Japanese, whereas over 25% of humanity understands English to some degree, and I?m sure they?d prefer English over Japanese audio. Nobody's going to learn Japanese just to watch a movie in the original language, so please kindly go fuck yourself."
,BucksRoger,2010-01-07T21:20Z,"Well after watching this NEW PIONEER DUBBED version I really consider learning japanese just so NOT to have to listen to that. Give me the original 1988 dub over this re-release crap anytime. 
BTW: I find watching movies in the original language w/ subtitles kinda hightens the experience. Of course you'll have to b able to read...
All that aside, as always: Thx uploader!"
,L337ish,2010-02-15T23:52Z,Great quality. Great UL. Thanks.
,Maphic,2010-02-24T03:27Z,"Rubbish quality the video is pixelated.  Forget this torrent, it looks like it was a rip from an old vhs tape rather than a dvd.  Downloading the 720 version now instead.

V - 5
A - 8"
,Skreshavik,2010-03-03T09:02Z,"Maphic, you're a fucking tard. I'm sorry that you were born in front of a 1080p plasma cannon, but this was in the late 80's.

Quality: 8
Sound: 9

The quality was pretty nice for back in the day, and this torrent has barely skewed it.
Sound was great, though there seemed to be the rare skip (might've been my machine, too!)

On a more personal note, the voice-overs are ok, but it doesn't have the same emotion as it would with the original Japanese voices. English subs with the Japanese would be the way to go on this amazing movie."
,eater78,2010-03-07T20:27Z,Thanks
,JigokuShojo,2010-03-09T00:28Z,thanks :]

,pervertednest,2010-12-15T06:17Z,"weird and surrealistic ending, really. japanese are really weird.  i should've just watched hentai instead."
,lrotger,2011-01-08T21:05Z,Fuck this mediocre dub. The original 1988 english dub is at http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4113979
,flapdroll,2011-04-17T15:17Z,I want more movies like this? two see tips someone
,osirisgothra,2011-05-24T11:23Z,"     I wasn't aware there was another English dub made for this movie. Although I am used to the original 1988 one that i have on VHS, I'll check this out and give some additional feedback on this, thanks to lrotger for pointing this out even though the comment was unnecessarily negative ;) ."
,Came12on,2011-07-24T03:55Z,"Yeah the newer dub is horrible, feel bad for people who havent watched the original"
,ingles666,2011-07-26T23:53Z,Thank you!
