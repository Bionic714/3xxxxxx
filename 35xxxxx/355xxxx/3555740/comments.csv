,Morlok8k,2006-11-25T07:28Z,"thanks for not including VCPR, it's only one of the best stations.  

you should have included it - we can keep what we dont want, but if you dont release it, we dont have that option - even if we wanted it.

just cause you dont like someting, doesnt mean that others dont like it as well."
,Demystikal,2006-12-02T14:13Z,First off those aren't all the songs from the game and second please add VCPR. Goodwork anyway.
,simoncelli,2007-01-02T20:07Z,it's all sux music

,dudedudesson,2007-06-09T15:00Z,Can someone  load up  the talkradiostation VCPR then ?
,goldenswordsman,2007-08-05T22:46Z,"the only fucking reason why this guy didn't upload VCPR is because he can't, because there aren't VCPR tracks released as CDs, and this fucking guy don't know how to convert .at3 files from UMD to .mp3, the song he got such as Phil Colin's In the Air Tonight isn't the exact version as the one in the game, which boasts better audio effect, plus, the arabic-indian stations songs aren't there because he's probably unable to because he's not familiar with the song and the spanish songs are incomplete, fuck you, fake!!!"
,Niklas91,2007-10-24T14:23Z,Right. This is very fake
,sushi_ahead,2007-10-31T13:06Z,"Jeezuss, feel the hate. Yeah, maybe it doesn't have everything, but just say that... If the guy ripped everything from seperate sources it just means more effort, and I note most of you haven't uploaded shit. Unfortunately the world is full of mouthy arseholes like half these posters. It's why we have wars."
