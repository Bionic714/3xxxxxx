,kencube,2006-11-08T15:34Z,"I'm seeding...
Tested with NWN2 v1.01, mount using DT 4.06, all emulation options on, and deactivate all optical IDE drives in the Device Manager. It works fine."
,carv,2006-11-08T19:38Z,You don't need to deactivate or unplug your drives. Just use Pr0t.Stop v1.0.  And it being a clone you can download the update patches and not worry about the game not working.   
,Marxist,2006-11-10T19:14Z,"i am using the reloaded crack and when i run it it goes to black screen and isnt responding. It says the amdxp.exe has an error. Any ideas how to fix it?

AntheiC , you are more stupid than you look (and believe me you look really stupid) if you post that link in 10 different torrents dont think that anybody will catch on that."

Just downloaded a buggered copy of the game, does this torrent work?"
,Tactical__,2006-12-17T11:25Z,"I have serious problems with this.

No matter what I try... Now I downloaded the older clone cd thing from GCW and mounted it with Daemon Tools 4.06, and once again I get this:

""A required security module can not be activated. This program can not be executed.""

Note that this isn't because it detects the emulation, then it would just say ""Emulation detected!"" (like it did when I mounted with Alcohol 120%. When I ran sd4hide.exe it didn't detect the emulation but said this same error message instead). I haven't even updated the game yet, so you'd think it would run... But no.

But when I mount this ( http://m0006.gamecopyworld.com/games/pc_neverwinter_nights_2.shtml#Neverwinter%20Nights%202%20[MULTI4]%20No-DVD/Fixed%20Image%201 ) with DT 4.06 I don't even need pr0t.st0p or sd4hide.exe, it doesn't detect the emulation but just gives this:

""A required security module can not be activated. This program can not be executed.""

What's up with this? What causes it?? :("

,Riddler-dk,2007-01-02T15:56Z,"Hi

I have a problem. Installed the game, and usedthe reloaded crack.
But then it checks my gfx card, and says it is not 128mbit, and the game might not run perfectly. i click ok, and the black loading screen locks down.
Is there anyway to trick or avoid, so it wont check my gfx card? cus i can play world of warcraft just fine in high resolution. So i should be able to play this aswell.

Hope to get some help!"
