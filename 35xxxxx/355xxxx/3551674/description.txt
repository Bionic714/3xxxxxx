yep, another great 3D pinball from the \"pro pinball\" series.
just burn the baby with clonecd (or imgburn, freeware on
imgburn.com), make a full install and play! you won\'t need any crack
when having the cd in your drive or mount the image.
if you want a crack, get it from megagames or somewhere else.
i don\'t spread cracks, that\'s all
have phun!

btw: my .rar-files always have a recovery record of 3%, so if your 
downloaded file sais \"corrupt archive bkla bla\" use the repair option
(winrar 3.61)
