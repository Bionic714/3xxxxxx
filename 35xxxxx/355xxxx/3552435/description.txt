Hey simmers, you\'ve all probably heard of adobes traffic pack by now, well another guy did something very similar and tried to get permission of evolve ai, PAI, AIA etc but they basically ignored him or told the lad to fuck off.

Read up on the dispute here--> http://tinyurl.com/ycze5u

Anyway to cut the story short, he made an AI package consisting of 220+ airlines using the best freeware models and paints available (AIA, EvolveAI, FsPainter, etc) and put it into an easy to use installer.

Required HDD space on install is approx 5.33Gb


Safe.
