,scooby321999,2006-11-06T14:03Z,this better than Adobe traffic pack?
,monstert,2006-11-06T14:13Z,"Dunno, never tried adobes 4.6 cos i couldnt get hold of it"
,mad_flyer,2006-11-06T15:28Z,Interesting. I still like the MyTraffic for FSX though. Looks better than that Orbit shit
,monstert,2006-11-06T15:44Z,I apologize about the slow transfer rate but i'm already seeding FSX as well. It should be alot quicker once a few people have downloaded this then begin to seed : )
,BritneysOrifice,2006-11-06T17:16Z,"monstert: thanks for the seed. I'm using Adobe 4.4 and, admittedly, it's fantastic. Great models, paints, airlines everywhere. But most importantly, I think the Adobe people set out to get the traffic as frame-friendly as possible. I'm wondering if Keiron (the maker of SimTraffic) has done the same thing? Have you tried it and how is it on frames (especially if you've compared it to Adobe AI)?  Thanks again."

,monstert,2006-11-06T18:37Z,"Well it works awsome on my computer and my specs are Nvidia 6 series and AMD 3200+ 
I only compared it to Adobe AI as this package was created in the same style. This will be a good package for anybody who wants some ai and cannot get hold of adobes traffic pack.
I've been looking for 4.6 everywhere but cant seem to get hold of it, but i'm happy with this one now anyway :)

[T],stevekasian,2006-11-06T20:41Z,"I've been using Adobe myself, and I'm really impressed with the accuracy of the scheduling, number of airlines, etc... But there is a majorly annoying problem with it: It's got the altitudes and speeds all fucked up. I get 757-300s flying along over Utah from KLAX to KEWR at like 13,000 feet... and other aircraft up at FL340 skidding along on their tails at 150kts. Happens all the time. I even have jetliners as low as 6,000 feet in the biddle of Bumfuck.
Framerates are much better than with MyTraffic though. I'll have to give this one a try.

,scooby321999,2006-11-06T21:48Z,"well no.. can't compare to v4.6 since no-one here has it.. but how is it compared to Adobe Traffic Pack v4.4??

Thanks for the feedback so far! Seems Like a good enough package... thanks for releasing it!"
,blankbox,2006-11-06T22:56Z,stevekasian.....BUT..... as long as its not yer ol Cessna 337 at FL340 things gotta be ok....right??
,monstert,2006-11-06T23:54Z,"I never tried 4.4 either. I guess you'd have to try this and see how they weigh up if you have both. This pack will be good though if you have no AI and couldnt get adobes packages like me. I'm having a really bad series of internet outtages at the moment due to my service provider fucking up so dont worry if u suddeny stop downloading, i'll be back seeding as soon as they rectify the problem. cheers."
,M@rtijn,2006-11-07T00:01Z,"Thanx! Been waiting for this one!

Anyone has got, by any chance, the updated PSS 777 (V2.1)?"
,BritneysOrifice,2006-11-07T00:32Z,"monstert: thanks for the reply (and thanks to others as well). So... having used Adobe 4.4 (like me), which would you say you like better? One thing I hate about Adobe 4.4 is the problem with traffic sliders. A great majority of the flights take place as long as the slider is at 1% or above! Insane. How does it work with Keiron's SimTraffic package (still waiting to complete the download)?"
,PopArt,2006-11-07T00:40Z,"Expect a traffic pack, made by me, before the end of the year. I am currently working on it. It uses Adobe 4.4 and 4.6 /WoAI /RATS /PAI and FrankO's packages as a base. I will check every airline for defuncts and rebranding. The slider will be working fine and cruise altitudes will be ""normal"" :) I have put a lot of effort in this package, being a perfectionist, so please be patient."
,BritneysOrifice,2006-11-07T00:49Z,"PopArt: whoa! Seriously? If you release that thing, it will be da bomb. One question: are you creating it for FS9 or FSX?"
,WinnieXL,2006-11-07T01:04Z,Yo Popart! Great to hear from you. A lot of work i think to make a traffic pack.

"
,PopArt,2006-11-07T02:31Z,"Yeah, a lot of work, but very satisfying :)

It will be for FS9 primarily (still using it, no plans to make the switch to FSX very soon), so I don't know if it will work in FSX.

So far, I have put a few months (!) work in it, but the end is near. Just some polishing, checking and making some readme's.

I'll keep you guys posted :)"

,pavcho,2006-11-07T04:40Z,"no, i'll keep seeding through the night.

,monstert,2006-11-07T08:51Z,"Thanks for seeding simmers.
Pop Art what you are doing sounds bloody awsome!"

,Sataris,2006-11-10T02:36Z,"does anybody have the patched Sim1.dll?

and :O PopArts around! :D"
,rrodger99,2006-11-11T20:08Z,"I just replaced the Adobe package with this 1 & saw a HUGE increase in traffic at Gatwick. It looks to be all the same models used in adobe & was very fps friendly.

Had a few instances of planes parked on top of each other but then had the same issue with Adobe too.

No GA or Mil traffic so I am going to see if the Tabntris pack will install."
,monstert,2006-11-12T21:55Z,"From what i know, there is going to be a 2nd version of this, bigger and better , including all the fixes, i'll try and get the blog address."
