This is my first torrent upload. Hopefully I\'ve done everything right. This torrent is for Pclinuxos Big Daddy p.93a. I\'m posting it here because the official mirror seems to be slow and I did not see a full unedited version hosted here.

This file is exactly as it was when it came off of their server. It\'s a very complete version of Linux that has excellent hardware detection. I have tried it on 2 of my computers (a laptop and a desktop) and have not ran across a single piece of hardware that did not work right out of the box. 

It runs as a live cd and you can install from the same cd if you wish. It\'s really simple to use and great for windows users that may want to try to figure out what Linux is all about. 

Anyway it\'s here if anyone wants it. Have fun with it.
