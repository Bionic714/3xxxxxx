,ghrayfahx,2006-11-07T19:10Z,"I apollogize, but I don't understand Swedish, and the translation stuff I have SUCKS! It translates to ""present dirt that had?: ) "" I'm sure that's not what you said, so could tou elaborate?"
,ghrayfahx,2006-11-09T00:28Z,"I personally recommend installing it all fresh, especially if you have a pre-2.0 release. If you have any problems you should delete the XBMC save and reinstall XBMC. (Copy it over again) I always do this, just because. It's not necessary, but it NEVER hurts to. You will have to readjust your screen if you have a 1.6 Xbox, and change any other settings though. Either way, I recommend deleting your old XBMC folder and replacing it with this one. Then take the Livecontent folder and put it at the root of your E partition."
