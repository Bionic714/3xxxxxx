XBMC 2.0 11-05-2006 FahxBahx Linksboks Integrated

Yes, you read that right, LINKSBOKS INTEGRATED! Your good ole pal GhrayFahx is here with the FIRST major release of XBMC 2.0 with Linksboks integrated right into it. And thanks to Roormonger's hard work, it is even supported in MC360. Yet another first ladies and gents. I hope this squashes the belief that I just cop builds by others. Just go to the XBMC Live blade and it's right there under internet. I've also included a new splash that I think you all should like. Well, without further ado, here's the build.
