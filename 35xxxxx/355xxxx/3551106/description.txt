Synopsis: 

This is the ultimate independent critical review of U2 on stage, on film and on record.
Presented by leading broadcaster Mary Ann Hobbs, the film draws extensively on rare live footage of U2 in performance from film and television archives around the world. The U2 biographer and Zoo Tour DJ, the legendary BP Fallon, leads a team of music journalists and working musicians in a complete review of the work of U2.

This film was made with complete editorial freedom. It is not approved, endorsed or associated with U2 or the management of the band. The result is the most hard-hitting, frank and penetrating review of the music and personalities which shaped the U2 phenomenon ever produced.
