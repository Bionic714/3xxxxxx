Just letting you know that the torrent's working fine and available for download now. I don't blame you thinking that it was dead. It's my first attempt at uploading and was 90% correct in what I did, but not 100%, hence the torrent was there, but not being seeded correctly. Sorry about that folks. I've added all 45 files as a single torrent now as well.
Go and try again...I'm sure you'll love it. all the best mate, have a great weekend.
