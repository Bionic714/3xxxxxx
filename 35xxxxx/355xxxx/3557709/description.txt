Movie Info:

In 2054, Paris is a labyrinth where all movement is
monitored and recorded. Casting a shadow over everything
is the city's largest company, Avalon, which insinuates
itself into every aspect of contemporary life to sell
its primary export -- youth and beauty. In this world
of stark contrasts and rigid laws the populace is kept
in line and accounted for.
