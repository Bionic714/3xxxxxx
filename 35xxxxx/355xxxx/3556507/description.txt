MESSAGE FROM T3CH___________________________________________________________
   This is the standard build I've been releasing for a while now. AMT has been updated to 0.93.5 since 2.0.0.
   I have also added Rockstarr's SNAKE Python game since 2.0.0. This build is based on 2.0.1 sourcetree as found on Sourceforge.
   The only changes since XBMC 2.0.0 are bugfixes, it is recommended to upgrade!
   Like last time around, a FAT build is coming, so if you want that, stay tuned!

APPLICATION INSTALL_________________________________________________________
   Fresh Install: Transfer _whole_ XBMC folder to your APPS folder (or where you want it).

   Upgrade: Backup the XBMC\UserData folder. Transfer whole XBMC folder to Xbox. 
            Overwrite UserData folder with your backed up copy. 


DASHBOARD INSTALL (SOFTMODS)_____________________________________________
   ARE NOT COVERED IN THIS README, SEE http://forums.xbox-scene.com/index.php?showtopic=406656


DASHBOARD INSTALL___________________________________________________________
   Option 1. Team XBMC's shortcut tool. 
   It's included in the _tools folder as <<SHORTCUT by TEAM XBMC.xbe>> + <<SHORTCUT by TEAM XBMC.cfg>>.
   Instructions here: http://www.xboxmediacenter.com/wiki/index.php?title=As_a_Dashboard (Option 1).
   Rename the <<SHORTCUT by TEAM XBMC.xbe>>+.cfg & also EDIT the .cfg so it matches your config. 
   See APPLICATION INSTALL above.

   Option 2. Thanks to an app called 'Team UIX's Xbe Shortcut Maker v1.0' by JbOnE, it's now easy...
   Transfer contents of XBMC folder (this is VERY important since the tool is hardcoded) 
   TO "E:\APPS\XBMC\". Rename <<SHORTCUT by TEAM UIX.xbe>> to something your bios can boot 
   (see http://www.xboxmediacenter.com/wiki/index.php?title=As_a_Dashboard or read your 
   BIOS README) and transfer to location your mod solution boots. No need to fiddle with HOME tag anymore, 
   and future upgrades you need not to worry about this file (unless you move XBMC).


UPGRADE TIPS________________________________________________________________
   If you're updating from a VERY old/bad build you may get issues. Follow these simple rules:
 o Replace (FTP OVERWRITE) all files in your XBMC folder with fresh ones from your new build
 o Delete old settings (from UserData/guisettings.xml)
 o In some rare cases some of the database files in UserData/Database/*.db may need manual deletion 
   (usually if they are very old). Note: This loses all per file settings you made with the old build!


TWEAKS BY T3CH______________________________________________________________
   I've cleaned up the scripts menu, >>XBMC\skin\Project Mayhem III\pal\dialogsubmenu.xml<< 
   (used for all resolutions) to only show the included QuickTimeBrowser & "XBMCScripts" scripts.
   If you add scripts yourself, this is the file to edit or replace.
