First two DVDs are DVD-9,very long ( over 8 GB ),impossible to compresse to satisfactory bitrate
so I'm giving them to you in full.You have few options here:

 A ) Burn with NERO on Double Sided DVD
 B ) Use software like DVDXCopy Express and split it into two DVD-5
 C ) If you have enough space on your HD,keep it there as long as you wish and than delete it.

DVD 3 is DVD-9 too,but only 5.5 GB long,done with DVD R-Pro.Here only English DD 5.1 is avaliable.
DVD 4 is DVD-5

The torrent will be closed at 99% untill everyone gets there.
