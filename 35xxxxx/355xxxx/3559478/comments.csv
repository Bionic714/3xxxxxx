Are there any interest for a other torrent with l word season 2?
I can up them, its a four split folders a season, with split files for every episode.
They are 3.5 gb per disk so I need help with seeding...there are some out there still seeding this but there rare and have slow upload.
I also have foxfire 700 mb.

,rudolfo2,2006-11-20T16:19Z,The torrent is at 99 % now and stoped.The problem is that most of you have slow connection or upload at minimum so it'll take a few days for everyone to get close to 99 %.
,rudolfo2,2006-11-22T09:17Z,"Some guys won't share/seed,so the torrent stays
unfinished.If you keep doing this there'll be no DVD 2/3/4.Get back and SHARE/SEED."
,rudolfo2,2006-11-23T09:35Z,No one want to seed so there'll be no DVD 2/3/4.Sorry.
