1) burn CD1 and CD2 on 2 disks. (see your burner doc for burning ISO files)
2) Insert CD1 and follow install directions
3) you must select ""full install""
4) copy ""syberia.exe"" from this directory to the microids/syberia directory (ignolre file already exists)
5) remove all cds
6) to play the game, you must use ""syberia.exe"" from this download.
7) have fun"

but could not thank you until now as I had some 
computer problems earlier....Anyhow this is a
great game and as I had played Syberia 2 and
seen the video in game 2 about game 1 I just
was so happy to find this one and the Graphic
Worlds in this one is almost as great as in the
second game....so ThanX a lot....Cheers."
