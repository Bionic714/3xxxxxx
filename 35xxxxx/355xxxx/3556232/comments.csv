,F@TMAN,2006-11-13T01:56Z,what is the difference between this MSDN release and what has already been released? Does it affect the WPA or registration?
,smoke420,2006-11-13T11:41Z,Question for agsqwe: Is this the original iso from MSDN or is it just the BillGates version with Windows.Vista.Iso.BillGates.To.Legit.MSDN.PATCH applied?
,-=robotnick=-,2006-11-13T15:14Z,As it's declared is an original image from Microsoft.
,crispytown,2006-11-13T15:17Z,Vista has not been released to MSDN as of  Nov 13 2006 @ 8:00AM CST.   So this is not a MSDN Release.  I also checked my MSDN Account and it was not there.  Only RC1 and RC2 and the Beta2.  So far only the Office 2007 suite has been added.
,smoke420,2006-11-13T16:49Z,Can anyone tell us the MD5 for this file?
,jlukensow,2006-11-13T17:19Z,Does anybody know if this is the actual release from MSDN.  I have heard on the forums that the RTM version hasnt even made its way to the MSDN download page.  What going on here?
,SpookyET,2006-11-13T21:16Z,"Just because it has not been posted on MSDN, it does not mean that this is not the actual ISO that will be posted.  Leaks are known to come out of MS."
,rdveu,2006-11-13T21:56Z,"As far as I know, this iso leaked before the patch. So, it could be real. Anyone who already tried it, please confirm :)"
,denlion,2006-11-13T22:53Z,"I've tried this and it works perfectly. After I installed it I had a 3 day activation but after I applied the ReeBSaW patch I have a fully functional 30 day ""evaluation"" version. I don't know if it will expire but when that happens I probably have a valid key."
,smoke420,2006-11-14T00:21Z,Can you tell us the MD5?
,linv5800,2006-11-14T01:45Z,"im using the bill gates version right now and it rocks!! but the fix no longer works , bill got to it.."
,skowfritt,2006-11-14T03:09Z,Look for iSEPIC`s activation instructions and follow them. They work as vista is now ACTIVATED on my machine.
,smoke420,2006-11-14T09:40Z,"Since nobody else will do it, here is the MD5 for this file: d1ff9802d93871c9b90fe5542e84f89e. It's the same as BillGates with the MSDN patch applied."
,smoke420,2006-11-14T10:38Z,Where can we find iSEPIC's instructions?
,smoke420,2006-11-14T11:30Z,"No it's not!

,noeyewar,2006-11-15T14:10Z,"hey
i have a questien to them of you who run this version.
it appears to be the final version but i am not sure.
i know the last thing ms did before sending the cd to the manufactor was to add some new nice icons.
look at this screenshot (look at the recycle ben)
http://winsupersite.com/images/showcase/winvista_rtm_starter_05.jpg

but my billgates version dosent show that nice icon, what about yours?
this should be a indication to if it really is the rtm release"
,kd6tas,2006-11-15T17:56Z,"(noeyewear): I didn't see any icons in that screenshot that weren't in this version.

What I question when it comes to whether this is really the RTM version is the fact that the ability to upgrade from an earlier version of Windows is disabled.  Further, no key at all is necessary for installation.  Logic dictates that this is more likely to be an MSDN version for developers to play with rather than what is actually going to put on disks and sold to the public next year.  Having to burn the .iso to disk and boot from it further supports that position.  Perhaps the core code is the same as what will be in the retail version, but the installation program will be different to say the least.

In any case, for those who are interested, this is the same as the Bill Gates version with the Bill Gates to MSDN patch.  I can verify that it works well.  I used Nero to burn the .iso to a rewritable DVD and installed it on a clean 27 GB partition so that I can dual boot Vista or XP.  The ""ultimate"" version takes up a little over 8 GB, so a 15 GB partition would likely be more than enough.
Also, this is a 900 MHz AMD Athlon box built in 2001 with 1 GB or ram and Vista Ultimate runs okay on it.  I like the performance testing and scoring that Vista performs.  I think it'll help people who ordinarily wouldn't do any benchmarking to know how capable their computers really are.  For example, the basic score for this one was 1.0 based on the video (GeForce 4 MX440) performance.  The overall score is something like 2 or so.  It's low by todays standards, but again Vista runs okay on it.

I've kept an eye on it since the 11th when I saw the first claimed RTM version on bit torrent.  In my opinion, this is the 32 bit version to go with.
It doesn't need to be patched, and when the .iso is burned to disk and installed to a clean partition it installs effortlessly.  At least it did in this case.
I've heard of some having driver issues, but that's an individual thing.  I was lucky in that regard.  As for activation, When installed with no key provided at all, it gave me 30 days to activate.  Personally, I don't like the current crop of activation cracks.  Back dating or using old files and keys seems hokey, forced and premature.  That's why I set it up as a dual boot arrangement.  I'm betting that something better will come along within the next 30 days.  If not, I'll either go with what seems best at the time or wipe the partition and start over.

I hope this was at least somewhat informative.
Good Luck."
