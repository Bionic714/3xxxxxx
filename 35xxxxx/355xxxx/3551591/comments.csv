,blizz26,2006-11-06T03:55Z,I didnt know that. All the videos I included said gartner or Cobra 148. Unless someone took claim to a video and put thier name on it or someone had changed the format somewhere along the way. I know that I believe the Gartner ones have the german subs which all the Season 1 videos do have in this torrent.

,p645n,2006-12-14T17:05Z,"THIS TORRENT IS CORRUPT
This torrent contains Season 1 rared into one file & Season 2 rared into a second file. Those two rared files are then rared together into a single file. You can unrar the big single file into the two rared season files but you CAN NOT unrar Season 2 IT IS CORRUPT -- it has a crc problem."

,blizz26,2008-05-19T02:11Z,"Go to mininova.com or torrentbox if you cant get it here. Warning, look at the file size and make sure its 7.84gigs.  Someone modified this file on other sites to 8.25gigs. I cannot say this file isnt corrupt in some way. The original file is on mininova.com and torrentbox.  blizz26"
,blizz26,2008-05-19T02:21Z,"By the way people. This is a blizz26 release not a jindel release.

 I no way did jindel have anything to do with the making of this file.

 jindel took this from another site and uploaded this file to this site.

 I had help from gartner and cobra148 putting this together. No one else. 

Give credit where credit is due.

,eaglenest608,2009-01-04T04:20Z,"For those that did not catch the really quick comment while reading, THIS HAS SUBTITLES.  Had I caught that, I would not have wasted my time downloading this.  Just wanted to warn anyone that is like me and hates things with subtitles.  Good quality though."

[T],whaleoilbeefhooked,2011-04-29T18:58Z,"Quite simple-You do not rar files for torrent -mays compressors are not compatible & its jus not necessary-rar was invented for windows 98 users with no space & measly 5 gig drives-we all have terrabytes of space now SO YOU DONT NEED RAR .
wouldnt take a week 2 d/l all thye back eps from eztv & demon & up the entire lot at once......UNRARED OF COURSE!"
