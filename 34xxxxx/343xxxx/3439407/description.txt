I've been going through one of my favourite movies, frame by frame and re-editing it into a different more fitting context.

Arnold Schwarzenegger is back, only with a twist!

This rendition of the 1987 classic is only 24 minutes long, and has a completely differerent context, one in which John Matrix (Arnold) is no longer the main character. Without him, the battle must continue, and the fight must go on.

Here are the arnold blockbuster fantastic highlights :

- Arnold DIES

- Sully Kills himself on a reverse upsidedown gravity cliff

- Biggs (That black guy) fights himself to death

- Alyssa milano (jenny) addresses some real disturbing issues not considered by the movie's original author(s)

- The *alternate* ending!

If you have trouble viewing the video, you might want to install the DiVX Codec.
