"
,phasmatrope,2006-01-13T23:58Z,"I'd delete it, but whoever designed this site ignored such a simple function. And based on all the torrents that I myself have tried to get from here that are STILL listed a year later, after noone's seeding them without any way of removing them, I don't want to perpetuate such misinformation."
,phasmatrope,2006-01-14T00:03Z,"I tried posting this disclaimer immediately after uploading it, yet this damn site won't let you write than a few lines per comment (which is why I had to keep commenting). So you can imagine how frustrated I am at how poorly this place is run, and why I don't want to deal with it. "
,phasmatrope,2006-01-14T00:11Z,"So until this site becomes more user-friendly, I promise to repost it someplace like D----noid, T-----spy, or M---nova (see, I can't even seem to post those sites' names). Again, sorry for the inconvenience."

,man-fish,2008-11-08T01:49Z,"I don't know if you'll read this, but once I get around to ripping the second disc of Preaching To The Perverted, I'll upload it here. =D"
