"
,TheBeastRocksOn,2006-01-13T03:09Z,"Don't know if it works on a Sony Ericsson K750.. I think it schould work on every phone which runs on Windows Mobile 2003SE or the newer Windows Mobile 5.
(You could maybe check on the TomTom site..)"
,Akoska1,2006-01-13T14:51Z,It won't run on a K750 since this is a PocketPC program wich runs only on PPC's.
,wannyw,2006-01-13T15:48Z,"It works fine on my nokia 6260, and it's runing on Symbian 6. I don't know about k750 though."
,Znuttisan,2006-01-17T21:20Z,"When I have followed the installationtip and then test it on my Qtek 8310 it stops at the startscreen, and then quits.
Does anybody know why?
Is it because the maps and *.dat files aren't syncronized?"
,Znuttisan,2006-01-18T19:02Z,"Is there anyone who can help me, 1000 people has downloaded the torrent, see below for the question."

,CPS001,2006-01-27T21:59Z,Anyone who knows how to add maps. Without maps the program starts and says it doen't find any. If I copy one on the SD-card the program terminates after I have agreed to not operate when driving. Is there special maps or what am I doing wrong. Running it on QTEK 8310
,docenten100,2006-01-28T23:09Z,"Also getting the same behavior on 8310, anybody got it to work with the crack?
Running the org .exe starts the program asking for activation, but the crack just quits, and yes, I have put some maps in the folder that the org .exe finds"

,alex_tay,2006-10-23T04:05Z,"Hi guys!

Not sure if anyone else is getting the same problem as me. TomTom's interface do not seem to allow me to use the touchscreen input on my ipaq. It responds only to my ""ok"" button on my qwerty keyboard. 

Have not been able to get pass to the manual activation yet.  

Tried replacing the .exe with the crack after I stopped the program. But the app seems to hang after that. 

Would appreciate some help for this pls! Thanks!"
