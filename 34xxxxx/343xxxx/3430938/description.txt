These files are an exact copy of the files on a SPV C500 and work fine on mine (as requested by some). 

This 'release' includes Postal codes (enables quick searching of an address) for the UK and The Netherlands and all voices. As an extra bonus ;-) I added some extra 'Colour schemes' (go to settings within TomTom to activate)

It does NOT include any maps since they are very well available.
