If my fellow armchair pilots find something (freeware or otherwise) that works well.. I'm all about reading it.  Just not enuff love in the world :)"

,hpteenagewizkid,2006-02-03T07:26Z,"Can't see the problem with freeware.  Yes it might be cool to say ""Oh look!  I've got all this payware software that I of course paid for and that's proudly part of my collection!"", but there are often freeware programs that are just as good if not better.

Keep up the good work."
