[V],Lillis89,2006-09-10T21:34Z,Don't write seed or seeding or nothing like that. Write thanks to the uploader!
,parlyzone,2006-09-19T18:25Z,"F*ck the uploader! It's been downloadet 13 times! That's not nearly enough to keep it going! He should know that.. And you should too.. Of course people are yelling for seeders! I'm one of them! Found another torrent on another site though.. Advice:

Everybody can throw every piece of shit out as a torrent, but what does that matter if the torrents they post are dead! I think you should have a link at the bottom called ""report dead torrent"" if you don't want this kind of shit repeated over, and over, and over, and over, and over again, catch my drift?

Universal love from Parlyzone! REAL Uploader! Check it!"
