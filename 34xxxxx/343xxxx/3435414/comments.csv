,Cylon99,2006-02-06T21:59Z,"Has anyone who's downloaded this expanded the files? I know I can mount it with Nero or Alcohol, but is it easy to exctract the MP3 files after that?"
,TheCracka,2006-02-07T07:28Z,You can't extract the mp3s man. It's all VOBs. You'd have to extract the audio VOB by VOB.
