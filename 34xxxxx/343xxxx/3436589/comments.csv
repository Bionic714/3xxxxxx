,xseb,2009-03-08T01:19Z,"stupid people!

there aren't 9 albums, but 9 folders full of music.

It's true, there are 5 albums... but not all the songs are released in an album.

there are singles, and exclusive songs that never go out to the market.

test before criticize!

BTW: I have 100% and seeding. It's completely OK"
