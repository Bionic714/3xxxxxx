This is Dungeon's & Dragon's Online Beta Hi-Res version, it is a very nice game, and is not available in stores except for pre-order.  You can head to http://www.ddo.com to get your free game key to play during the beta time, and once the game comes out, it will cost $14.95 per month USD.


The Hi Res version system requirements are


2.6 Ghz CPU
DirectX 9.1 compatable sound card
128 MB Video Card...I am playing with a 64MB NVidia GeForce 4 4000MX Card, it plays fine unless there are a lot of people in one area (i.e.  Towns and Taverns)
1GB RAM...I have 512 DDR RAM, and it plays but same problem as above.
at least 6 GB of HDD Space, this game is huge.
Broadband Internet Connection.
