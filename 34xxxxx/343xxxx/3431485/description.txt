DiSNEYLAND Mini Images for Thief Gold and Thief II (also Thief2X)

Haven't tested these with DromEd yet, so do that yourself :)

Either way, these images substitute any NoCD patches/cracks to run
the games without the CD2 discs in the drive. I'm very annoyed with
having to rip CDs with CloneCD in order to play games without
putting CDs in my drive, so for Thief Gold and Thief 2, these are
my solutions. Rather annoyingly, I had to rip all CDs and install
by mounting them with Alcohol (drive X:), otherwise the games would
look for the original discs in my real DVD drive (drive W:)... So 
you might have to do the same (unless you know of some trick to
have the game look at a mounted drive instead of the real drive). 

Anyways, I use Alcohol 1.9.5, and can't tell if it works with
Daemon Tools or some other program, but I can say for sure it
works with Alcohol 1.9.5.

Enjoy!
