But it's a ISO image, if you extract it you'll see the other files."

@zoltanruler ...It's obvious that you are a copycat because you've uploaded this software to in your name?! ;-)"
,krisbi,2006-02-05T22:25Z,"@frankie79   yes u are right i forgott that it goes,i never use winrar on ISO's,think u can do it from vers. 3.20 and newer."
,frankie79,2006-02-08T13:07Z,I've noticed that you can use this serial: SSDA-ONLN-AAAA-MZKS-UOVO but it will expire 060424.
