Prescription: Murder (1968)

This is the first of two pilot movies made before Columbo became part of the Mystery Movie wheel that played on television for most of the 1970s.

Plot outline:
Psychiatrist Ray Fleming is having a passionate affair with actress Joan Hudson, and uses her to help him murder his wife Carol, and to make it appear the work of a vandal. Fleming and Hudson pull off the murder and deception, but when Fleming returns from a vacation (which served as the prerequisite for the deception), he encounters a rumpled LAPD Lieutenant, Columbo, whose seeming bouts of attention-deficit disorder and meandering questioning mask a devilishly skilled investigator who soon recognizes the murder of Carol Fleming to be the work of her husband, but who must work diligently to find the proof needed.

This film, which established Peter Falk as the definitive Lt. Columbo, was adapted from a 1962 play by the same authors, which had starred Thomas Mitchell as Columbo. This in turn had been adapted from the "The Chevy Mystery Show" (1960) episode "Enough Rope", in which Bert Freed originated the role of Columbo.
