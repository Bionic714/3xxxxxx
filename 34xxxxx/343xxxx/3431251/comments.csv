,anotherreprobate,2006-09-08T17:28Z,"If you can't get CD's to work, I couldn't get CD2 to work either! Try this no CD installation method. Creat 3 new folders on desktop or wherever you want. UnRAR INV1_SERIES10 to New Folder (1), inv2_series10 to new folder2, inv3_series10_cc to new folder3.
Open New Folder1, open ""bin"", open the folder ""acadfeui"", One of the five folders in ther is called ""Cabs"".
In a new window, open New Folder (2op), open folder ""bin"", open folder ""acadfeui"".
Right click on folder ""bins""and copy it to your first folder. This will add cab files m110 to m150 to the first folder. 
Repeat this with New Folder(3) to get bin file m151. Close folders 2&3.In the open folder, click setup. Towards the end of the installation you may get 6 messages about not being able to wrte to registry about SQL Server priveleges. Press the button to ignore these"

,jordanm0611,2007-09-14T06:24Z,Works fine for me. listen to anotherreprobate if you have problems. his advice for this program works
,pindrop,2007-10-14T15:45Z,does not work... ms installer error
,chaosrxn,2008-01-14T00:38Z,"Works PERFECT with anotherreprobate's method
the only thing I did different was simply copy the .cab files into the first unrared cab folder

But I think there is something wrong with the software
There were many errors during installation, but I just skipped/ignored them, activation is perfect and hassle free, and finally runs perfectly, no .cab problems, doesn't randomly close.

Only problem: settings don't save
When ever I set the snaps, or any document setting, when I close Inventor, the setting go back to default. 

Otherwise, works PERFECT.
Seeded."

  Copy all the CABfiles from disc 2 and 3 to the CABSfolder at disc 1.. then install and use the keygenerator. (Ignore all the ignorethings, I had 34 of them..) Serialnumbers can be found all over the pritebay. "

,Keymis,2010-10-29T13:34Z,"Got it working on Windows 7 x64!
Just download the file, Unzip it completely into a new folder, and copy the cab files m110 to m150 like 'anotherreprobate' explained. Also install  MS WSE 2.0 (messiahmaster' already posted the link) Than start the install by running the file: 'Inventor' (can be found in your new folder, bin, acadfeui). Run the setup with the usual errors and warnings, than follow the rest of the setup guide for activation.
Hope this helps! 
P.S. I'm running it with an ATI HD5850 and this doesn't give me any problems.."

,sammy-tk,2011-01-02T05:01Z,"I seem to be able to install it alright (other than a couple of error messages) by adding all 151 cab files to the first folder and then running the setup.exe, but there are many flaws within the app such as not being able to modify dimensions or make components flush with each other etc. Does anyone else have these troubles or can anyone suggest something to fix this?"
