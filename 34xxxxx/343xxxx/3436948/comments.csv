One sub takes about 3kb and extra audio 400mb. Get my point?"
[V],hozza,2006-01-28T19:10Z,"Stuffer.....It's a movie for kids. Do you really expect a 5-year old swedish/norwegian kid to understand english? Do you understand swedish? Get my point?
Good work OnTheBeachside !"
,_crs_,2006-01-28T20:19Z,"Stuffer, are you retarded. The retail dvd released for the Norwegian & Swedish market contains only Norwegian / Swedish / English audio tracks and subtitles. He didn't rip out anything, and he even says so."
,stuffer,2006-01-28T21:12Z,"well, i only looked languages & subs, not the removed part. My mistake!"
,dvdfreak,2006-01-29T09:47Z,A subtitle on a DVD is far more bigger than 3kb. I'd say closer to 10MB/language for a normal movie.
,Hero_best,2006-01-29T20:08Z,SEED FFS!!!!

,Azman,2006-02-07T12:45Z,"What program must I use to play this movie??
I have never done this before."
,Azman,2006-02-07T13:05Z,"Sorrt for spamming, but what files must I play together to get sound and picture???"
[V],OnTheBeachside,2006-02-08T11:09Z,"Disse filene er laget for brenning på en DVD, eller kan kjøres via DVD player som kan spille av fra mapper.

Ved brenning benytt f.eks. Nero 7 og angi at du skal lage et prosjekt for DVD-Video.

Legg så inn filene i prosjekt mappen VIDEO_TS og du er klar til å brenne DVD'en.
