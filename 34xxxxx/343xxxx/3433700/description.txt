14 years ago P.O.D formed in San Diego. On the
new album "Testify" singer Sonny, drummer Wuv,
bassist Traa and guitarist Truby have received
help from hit maker Glen Ballard. "Glen pretty
much took the best of what we had already
recorded up to that point and made it even
better," Wuv said.

The title "Testify" has a lot of meaning to the
band. "To us, that word speaks for itself. It's
powerful. In our 14 years together, that's what
we've been doing. We've been testifying to the
things that we believe in and that we've come to
know," Sonny said.

Now it's time for all you P.O.D fans to enjoy
this testimony from the band as we have the full
album for you to listen to one week prior to its
release. Go on and enjoy!
