,DeeDoo3,2006-03-23T14:22Z,"I believe this movie has a potential, even thought it may not be as creepy as the games."
,butanebobb,2006-04-07T07:47Z,"The good thing is it's not being directed by an american. Also they're using music and monsters straight out of the games, so at least it will have a similar atmosphere... not like all the bullshit teen horrors that seem to be popular."
,Mr Underhill,2006-04-18T20:07Z,"None of the movies coming out nowadays are all that scary.... If you truly want to have the shit scared out of you, watch the Legend of hell house on a dark stormy night with the lights turned off and no cheating by keeping the glade airfreshener in the wall socket that has the night light..."
