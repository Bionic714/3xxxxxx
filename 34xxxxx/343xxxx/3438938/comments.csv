,fedrik,2006-11-25T12:58Z,"check the files. you will get the version no.

,BIGKDAWGTHEGREAT,2007-08-03T05:52Z,jonatanJJ the problem with this copy of linspire is missing modules needed to load the sytem either for install or Live cd so that means that it is useless so to all there is no point in downloading this even though Linspire is great lol!!!!!!!!!
