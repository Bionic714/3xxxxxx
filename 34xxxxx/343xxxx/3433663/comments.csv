,bushbear,2006-01-21T10:09Z,"FSD website  has new ""Download New File"" after ""Files & Installations""  for all their planes, including the CD versions-- STAY AWAY FROM THESE!! (UNTIL they are CRACKED)they bug your pc with worms and trojans- i hate you Steve Small!!! but i still can get your  overpriced-software --;-)"

Anyone got technical training on PC (CBT)? IÂ´m looking for something like JAR66/EASA66 B1 technical training or JAMF (from Lufthansa) or something similar?"
,experimental_pilot,2006-01-22T00:07Z,Has anyone had a problem with this B200?  I seem to have no pitch control.
,experimental_pilot,2006-01-22T00:09Z,"bobdaslob, Do you use Azeurus?  Go to File/New Torrent and follow the step by step instuctions.  If you need help send me a message!  :-)"
,whupp,2006-01-22T00:37Z,So has anyone got the new DF 727 v2 ? please anyone can they upload it or crack the wrapper :-)
,cfear,2006-01-22T06:17Z,"for pitch control, on take off you really gotta crank it up or ur not getin of the ground"
,cfear,2006-01-22T06:17Z,crank up the trim that is**
,experimental_pilot,2006-01-22T06:18Z,"Crank what up?  With full elevator deflection and over take-off speed, still no pitch control."
,experimental_pilot,2006-01-22T06:19Z,Oh ok.  Didn't see your previous post. :-)
,experimental_pilot,2006-01-22T16:40Z,Even with full nose up trim.  Still no pitch control!
,SimNute,2006-01-23T00:33Z,No luck. I am at 70% and no one is seeking.
,SimNute,2006-01-23T00:35Z,"You have to set the trim high. Almost to the line. Another thing, the torque gauges are not working."
,SimNute,2006-01-23T00:37Z,I meant no luck with the FSD Ceneca V
,experimental_pilot,2006-01-23T01:27Z,The updated B200 torrent above works fine.  2.0.0.1.
