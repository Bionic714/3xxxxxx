In the second drop down box in the network options menu, there is a list of three mac addresses, change this setting on each computer until it works.

If you still have problems, post again here and I will see what I can do (remember to seed!!!)

2) You can play LAN over internet using Hamachi (google it)
3) Use this patch: http://www.understorm.net/cnc/lan/ts_ra2.php for playing over network on vista
4) To play on vista, set the compatability of ra2.exe to 2000 or XP, and right click ra2.exe and click Run as Administrator"
