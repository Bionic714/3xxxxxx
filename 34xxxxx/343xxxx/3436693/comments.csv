,DickySwing,2006-01-28T18:07Z,"how does it really work? do I need a version of gta on my psp memorystick?
Or can I now buy GTA and play it but still play downloaded games?"
,Echonator,2006-01-29T19:47Z,"I´m not 100% sure, but i think you need a homebrew copy of gta. More info at http://pspupdates.qj.net/"
,Rille_92,2006-01-29T20:29Z,Is there a readme?
,alphatron,2006-01-30T05:05Z,"You need GTA:LCS to use this. The one you bought from the store. If you have a version on your mem stick, and can play it, you probably don't need to use this eboot in the first place. I just tested it, works great."

,Echonator,2006-02-17T21:41Z,"Om du undrar om man kan använda den här emulatorn på 2,6 så vet jag inte, men allt bygger på att du har en version av GTA"
