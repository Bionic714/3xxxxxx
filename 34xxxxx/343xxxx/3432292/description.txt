[b]Description/Info:[/b]

Tearing through 16 songs in under half an hour, Good to Go proves that at this 

juncture in their career, 7 Seconds are a tight, professionally solid hardcore 

unit, capable of writing catchy melodies and perceptive, intelligent lyrics to 

complement the hyperspeed aggression of their sound. Good to Go isn't a 

revolutionary hardcore punk record, just one that's extremely well done.
