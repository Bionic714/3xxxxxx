This Version contains absolutely no English.  I purchased it from yesasia.com not realising that there were no English subs.  It only contains Chinese and Japanese audio with Traditional Chinese subs.  I have included both audio tracks in my first attempt at creating a Matroska video, quality isn't perfect but it's not bad for a first attempt ;-)

BTW, in regards to the lack of English subs, if anyone knows a way to OCR traditional chinese subs I will be glad to translate them and upload a new file.  Just post here and let me know.
