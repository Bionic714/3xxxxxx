,daaaniel,2006-02-01T20:39Z,"What happened to ""Peter's Done it""? (Episode 10)"
,daaaniel,2006-02-01T20:42Z,"Okay I found out! ""Peter's done it"" is aired 5th feb."
,jimmy_929@hotmail.com,2006-02-01T22:17Z,It says why this is the 11 episode in the info. Just read it.
,sjørøver-ole,2006-02-02T00:46Z,Yeah! I wrote about episode 10 when i posted this torrent. Learn how to read the description...
,sjørøver-ole,2006-02-02T00:46Z,You're a good man Jimmy ;o)
,glupchup,2006-02-02T11:51Z,"haha! ...downloaded in 6 minutes. Gold.. thanx, man! :D"
,Tombraso,2006-02-03T19:08Z,Very wierd that episode 11 is released before episode 10!
,Tombraso,2006-02-03T19:14Z,ok sorry for my message before this is episode 10. im just confused why you have written episode 11... episode 9 was Brian Sings & Swings and after that episode Patriot Games is supposed to come. and you said that this is called Patrios Games so i guess this is episode 10
,HelgeFossmo,2006-02-03T21:55Z,"Tombraso: you are a idiot. every other post clearly tells you that this is episode 11, stfu you fucking retard"
,Tombraso,2006-02-06T15:27Z,HelgeFossmo: right back at you mate
,cluster-,2006-02-07T14:18Z,"Ni är alla medvetna om att detta faktiskt är episod 10 eftersom den har sänts före ""Peter's done it!""? bakaru"
,sjørøver-ole,2006-02-08T21:30Z,"Tingen er at dette -egentlig- skulle være episode 11, men det ser ut som om de har gjort om denne episoden til nr. 10."
,sjørøver-ole,2006-02-08T21:32Z,"Uansett, vi får se hva ""LOL"" gjør med den saken:p Kanskje vi får en dobbel 11, eller noe annet lurt:p"
,sjørøver-ole,2006-02-08T21:35Z,"""Peter's done it"" har dessuten blitt utsatt enda en gang fra 5. feb. til 26. feb."
,Tcip,2006-02-14T01:46Z,"FFS, there is NO seasons 5! http://www.tv.com/family-guy/show/348/episode_listings.html&season=4"
,Dragowitch,2006-02-14T23:45Z,E11? When does it come out?
,zoltaaaan,2006-03-08T04:59Z,"Ok, so why is there still no episode 10 OR 12? Have they even been aired at all?"
,janzak,2006-04-26T22:51Z,"Who the fuck CARES? Just download the fucking ep and enjoy, if you so badly need to know you can jizz all over the DVD box when it comes out"
