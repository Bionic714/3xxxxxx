In the arena of reality shock videos, few come close to the unbridled audaciousness of Bumfights. Bumfights, Vol. 1: Cause for Concern features exactly what one would expect from such a title. Homeless men are paid to go toe-to-toe, brutally beating each other to bloody pulps. Also included is footage of other streetfights and an appearance by model Angela Taylor. Viewer discretion is advised. ~ Matthew Tobey, All Movie Guide.
