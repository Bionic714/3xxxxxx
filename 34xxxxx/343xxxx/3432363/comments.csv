,Dead-Inside,2006-01-16T15:41Z,Just buy the god damned games. They're worth the money.
,PHILLY25,2006-01-16T17:13Z,"shut up, buy it yourself, i mean where dp people come from and talk so much shit, the game is old, realy old, its like a dollar now, so what downloading is also fun and ofcourse haveing 100/10 mbit internet connection makes things easier , thanx ukato, keep up the good work, i will seed when am done, ciao"
,PCaristot,2006-01-17T01:19Z,The major benefit of buying the games is that you will be able to use the battlenet = the best part of starcraft.
,ukato,2006-01-17T01:48Z,PCaristot speaks the truth.
,Dead-Inside,2006-01-17T10:01Z,"PHILLY25, you're just dumb aren't you? Read the below two comments. Also, when I say buy the games, I also apart from B.net, think you should support the developer, Blizzard. You should always support games you think are good (and this is a good game). Now take out your braces and go to bed."
,Koliare,2006-01-22T17:34Z,"I cant belive the size of this torrent u guys crazy!!!?!?!?

Cracked installed and fully workable (-B.net) if copied to another computer thats 150mb

But internet is the only way to have fun with SC:BW so therefor run out to any local gameshop and order it. unless you are a fatass and order it throu internet to your mail box and makes your kids run get it :D"
,Trashcanman02,2006-02-07T12:29Z,"Last time I was at GameStop, the price was 20 dollars. I am ashamed to play a Blizzard game without paying, but I don't have any money. "
,ukato,2006-02-07T22:40Z,"whoever asked about the size, it's because the .iso are included... for backups."
,aguil,2006-02-12T12:54Z,"the best game ever made ...if I buy it ,it will be no more that fun...
there is way to crack BNET...you have to change the registry key value ...thanks to the uploader..."
,ukato,2006-02-13T22:43Z,"aguil, that crack is included with the pack. i couldn't get it to work. of course i didn't try for very long."
,kingkhong82,2006-02-20T14:43Z,jus wana knoe if tis one can work in XP or jus the 95/98 version.THX
,cheersYpdr,2006-02-24T16:42Z,"how do I get the B-net file to work? Can anyone tell me please? I'm new to this =) ,)"

,pistolfied,2006-10-20T23:00Z,Downloading at the amazing speed of 0kb/s wow.....
,uikiliki,2006-11-11T02:36Z,"What are people like Dead-inside even doing here?
If you really dislike copyright infringement you have no place coming here downloading stuff. At least stick by your principles.
Blizzard are notorious among companies which enforce copyright. Look what they've done to bnetd and freecraft. Any company which tries to throw it's weight around and use stupid laws to restrict peoples freedoms does not deserve our money. If any company should NOT have games bought from it's Blizzard.
I'd be much more inclined to buy a game I really like from a company which doesn't care about copyright. Companies like Blizzard need to boycotted for their tactics, and taking their games without paying for them hits the point home that much more succintly."
,Username_is_hidden,2006-11-24T05:06Z,Amen to that!
,PureJeenyus,2006-11-25T04:03Z,damn i need this i just scratched the shit out of my broodwar disc
,kingofallworlds,2006-11-25T06:08Z,"I concur with uikiliki, Dead-Inside has no business being here. This is a copyright void site, if this goes against your morals, don't come here and complain about it. --- Also, I can't seem to play the campaign mode. I keep on clicking on Terran, but it won't access it. I can play custom maps, but that's it. What can I do to fix it?"
,the seal giver,2006-11-26T21:08Z,please seed for a while...
,panokkio,2006-11-27T16:02Z,thx for seed
,feelinsupersonic,2006-11-30T01:36Z,"For the record I have bought this game. 3 times. Stolen once, lost it twice. This is ridiculous. I'm not buying it again. It's 10 dollars anyway, so it's obviously not about money."
,Flatskjerm,2006-12-13T21:07Z,"Blizzard sux..
Games like WoW sux..
But actually starcraft and brood war rules.
But i dont wanna buy the game anyway cus blizzard sux."
,doff88,2006-12-23T01:32Z,"I need help!!!!  this error comes up: starcraft is unable to read a required file. Your starcraft CD may not be in the cdrom drive. please ensure that the starcraft disc is in the cdrom drive and press OK. To leave the program, press exit. what do i do?"
,Arne_1337,2006-12-27T23:55Z,where can i find the crack ?
,praxie,2007-02-24T01:17Z,Sluta ta alla mina seeders >.
,praxie,2007-02-24T13:56Z,"Fuck you @bz, where can i find the crack?"
,Ciprinator,2007-03-19T13:01Z,"The game works good, but the colours are screwed."

,GreviusTheMighty,2007-04-25T18:28Z,"Seed Please!!
Sn채lla seeda!!"
,ManUnited4Ever,2007-05-29T09:05Z,"Just so you all know, if you burn the iso to a CD, (instead of using DaemonTools etc...) the game will function perfectly without any crack.

I've cracked Battle.net a long time ago, but i think my keygen is different from this one."
,petergarrat10,2007-06-02T01:55Z,"if i use a successfull CD-KEY, can i play battle.net?

Is this only for campain? thats gay......"
,W00DR0W,2007-06-24T01:17Z,"Thanks, I'm going to see if it works by just mounting the ISO with deamon.

I bought the game, but CDs are scratched up."
