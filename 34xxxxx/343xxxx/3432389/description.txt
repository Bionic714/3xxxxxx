"Aaron Funk returns to the claustrophobic beats and brutal atmospheres of the earlier classics 'Doll Doll Doll' and 'Find Candace' for this dark opus recorded back in 2003 between the 'Chocolate Wheelchair' and 'Huge Chrome Cylinder' albums. 'Meathole' eschews the charming melodic sketches and string samples of it?s predecessor 'Rossz Csillag...' for a dark underbelly of unease and brutality. The beats are unrelenting and the odd-time signatures and spooky pads are all present and correct."
