,Ratiocinator,2006-01-17T04:14Z,Thank you for this. I bought it on cd years ago; ethereal quintessence.
,Arild5k,2007-03-03T01:28Z,"this sux, i tough it was black metal but it`s just some instrumental crap, fuck this shit."
,Tzaeru,2007-04-25T08:01Z,"*nods* Thanks for the seed. Actually I requested this over year ago, and never answered to your answer :p 

Erm.. Those were the messy times..

Anyway, great stuff. And may I ask, referring to above comment, what is 'instrumental crap' supposed to be? Using other tools besides of traditional band instruments doesn't automagically mean that the essence, idea or feel of the music changes.
Idiot."
,mastersturm,2007-12-21T01:22Z,"the answer to instrumental crap is ""poser"".  common poser reaction back in the day when black metal stopped being the underground of the underground.  All the posers that were into the image rather than the true essence of black metal have insecurity issues and misanthropic medieval melodies isn't ""tough"" to them, cause everything has to be ""tough"".
Stay away from this album if you're a poser, stay away from black metal all together come to think of it.  Go back to listening to Limp Penis... err.. Bizket."

,Mysticum81,2008-04-04T08:59Z,"Sweet, I haven't listened to this in a decade. Thanks for sharing :)"
,Gargoth666,2008-05-08T19:28Z,"i agreed to all of you, this is a really crap cd. how the hell could the labels even think this was good? "
,Gargoth666,2008-05-08T19:32Z,i can recomend elffor and summoning. much better than this.
,Gargoth666,2008-05-08T19:35Z,"mastersturm: yes, there are some band in the black metal scene, who think that everything must be tough. but that is just an image and not a thing all black metal guys think or believe."
,Nigmae,2008-05-10T19:39Z,"Hey Asgrahim, if you have all those Black/Death/Ambiant Metal torrents, you should compile them in a single Torrent and upload it!

BTW, most of your other torrents have 0 seeds. THat's to bad, because there's a bunch of good stuff listed."
