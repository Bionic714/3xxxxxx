,keralaguy,2009-12-09T23:41Z,"how to install 
1. no need to convert the file format
2. download power iso software
3. choose the file igi cd1 and expand it
4. click on the crack folder , we can see an igi.exe file there
5. then left click and copy to clipboard 
6. delete the original igi.exe file( do not delete igi.exe
        in the crack folder)
7. then again left click and paste it there
8. then burn into a disc
9. now cd1 is finished
next choose cd2 
1. delete folder special features ( it just about next releasing
  or already released game)
2. then burn it into an another disc
3. finish
next 
insert the disc and click install igi2
put serial key 1320-615D-BA73-52EC
after first cd, install second cd
at the end it asks for cd1 ( even it needs updating registry)
insert cd1 
automaticatically or manually select igi icon 
it opens and enjoy............."
