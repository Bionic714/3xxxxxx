,snafas,2006-01-28T22:57Z,"What codec is this? I have the DivX and Xvid plugins installed in my WMP and other .avi files run beautifully, but these files don't work.

Can anyone tell me what codec I need and where I can get it?

Thanks!"
,Deussu,2006-01-31T18:01Z,This is on some bizarre codec. I can't open it with anything. Who's the dim-witted person who ever did these?

,MicroNut,2006-11-26T17:55Z,"""Star Trek TAS 1x01 - Beyond The Farthest Star.avi"" is currupted.
Gspot wont recognize it and Video Fixer 3.23 says it cannot be repaired. 
If anyone knows how to fix or can post post a repair file this would be great.
All the other videos play fine."
