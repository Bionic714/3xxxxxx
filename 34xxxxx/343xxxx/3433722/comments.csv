,john170950,2006-09-02T17:03Z,"Thanks for the film.  It took me a while to get it but I think its good now.  The entire swarm was at 99.9% complete and it just would not finish (~1MB missing: 4425.81MB of 4426.81MB downloaded).  However the incomplete rar at 97% appeared to be the full 50,000,000 bytes.  So I double clicked it (part079.rar), opened in WinRar, right clicked on the archive and selected Repair archive.  A repair dialog asked if I wanted to discard suspicious data, I chose Yes and a copy of part079.rar was created.  Rename the copy to the original and extract selecting the option to Keep Broken Files.  There were errors but it seems to be ok and plays right through to the end.  "
