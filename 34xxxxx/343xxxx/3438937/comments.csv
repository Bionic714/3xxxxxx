,eskilator,2006-08-20T20:23Z,how do i run this file?
,Snaddre,2006-09-20T16:52Z,"Im having trouble running the the game, here is what i did:

Fist i mounted the torrent with deamon tools and then i ran the installation.
When it was innstalled i pressed play Airfix Dogfighters. Then i got a mesage that the cd room was not in. Further on i downloaded a backup no cd file pack. I followed the instrctions that told me to replace two files, the dogfighter exe and the aengine.ars or something like that. Then i tryed to run the game again, it occured an error and had to close down!

So i can start via deamon tools and get told that the game cd is not or i can run it from my brand new dogfighter exe and then occur an error! What shall i do to play the game?"
,Snaddre,2006-09-20T16:53Z,"BTW: There is some seeders and peers, i downloaded this when the info box up to the right told me there were no seeders or peers :D"
,Snaddre,2006-09-24T21:49Z,"Hi its me again, Snaddre... Just wanted to say hat ive solved the problem....

I downloaded a file archive and got two files wich i traded for the orginal ones. Then i selected a file named ""af.engine"" or something and selecte open. Then i choose select program from list and then i found the dogfighter exe. Gotta do that everytime i have to start the game, but its worth it!!!!"
