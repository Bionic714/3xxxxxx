,Only_mac,2006-02-02T13:57Z,"somebody have this game for mac: TIGER WOODS PGA TOUR® 2005 , please upload it"
,caldaean,2006-02-02T22:25Z,"Är detta för classic, eller det finns en OS X launcher?"
[V],nimbus123,2006-02-05T21:23Z,"Skulle tippa på classic. Köpte orginalet en gång
för 10kr (nytt), med box och manual och allt =)
Finns inte till OSX såvitt jag vet. I alla fall inte
officiellt."
,crafterr,2006-05-28T05:10Z,hahah SUKKA
,Brocccoli,2006-11-06T11:57Z,"now now children, no fighting!"
,Fire Crow,2007-05-23T17:24Z,"Does it work on new versions of Mac, like Tiger? 'Cause I've downloaded it and Mac shows me message that I can't open the application ""Diablo Installer"" because it is not suported on this system... I wanna play old school Diablo!!!!"
,Talonkarrde88,2007-06-28T13:50Z,Blizzard released a special installer for Tiger. Search OSX Diablo and you'll find it.
,bimble,2007-09-19T11:16Z,"you need to get the patch.works with shit quality graphics on full screen,but much better in a window.you have to run it in software on the video options page."
,m_magius,2007-10-08T22:41Z,I can't get this game to run on my macbook. Does anyone have a solution?
,jetlag4321,2007-10-23T01:01Z,please seed
,MACinized,2007-12-08T08:30Z,is this the 1st one? coz i'm hoping it's the Diablo II.
,MACinized,2007-12-10T13:57Z,"finished downloading & sadly it's not diablo 2. so frustratingly, it doesn't work in leopard. aarghh..."
,tilman,2008-01-17T16:21Z,i don't suppose anyone knows if there is a patch available to get this to run on intel based macs. i've been cruising around blizzard tech support and found nothing to say yes or no.
,snoopfroggyfrog,2008-02-02T19:06Z,I did a concentrated investigation... I can only find an OSX-Installer-version for Diablo2. No way to find one for diablo... (This version here is for OS9) Is there really one out there? could somebody provide a link? I wanna play it (on PPC G4)...
,gr8wizkid,2008-08-14T03:18Z,pleese seed I am almost done and will seed when I am finished
,paysed,2009-01-20T17:07Z,"http://forums.macosxhints.com/archive/index.php/t-60933.html

Boot under OS 9 if you've got a PowerMac and it should be fine even though you normally run osx."
