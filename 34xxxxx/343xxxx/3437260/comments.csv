But after playing Shadow of the Colossus (and loving that one) I decided to give it a try again, and guess what, the game is bloody brilliant!

Its being released in Europe again i feb, def worth buying."
,minoni,2006-02-04T22:29Z,"Hi, I've downloaded ICO but i can't burn it to a DVD. I'm using nero and when i try this comes up:
Sorry, your compilation cannot be written on this kind of disc. Please insert a disc of the correct type or modify the settings of your compilation to make it compatible with the current disc.
Disc required for the compilation: CD-R/RW
Disc type in the recorder: DVD+R 

Why doesn't it work with a DVD disc? I don't have a cd-r that has space for 900 mb. It says i can modify the settings but how? Anyone that can help me?"

cheers/Ich1 K"
,Nexus6000,2006-02-05T17:09Z,"Minoni: That true, Nero seem to think it's in Cd-r
format. 

Use Dvd Decrypter or Alcohol 120% instead.
