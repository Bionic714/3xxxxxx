"Aaron Spectre makes digital sounds with a distorted soul, fragile melodies sprinkled with urban grit, grime layered over dense harmonies." This statement is ever true with Aaron's latest release on the respected Omeko label from Osaka, Japan. And what a worthy follow-up to his "Evil Most Foul" release on Death$ucker. Tight amens collide with brutal guitar riffs to create an infectious and exciting blend of well, jungle and punk!"
