Description on back of DVD


"Anyone can put out a DVD of them doing well. I think failure is funnier. The contents of this DVD include some clips I found in my attic of my show watched by 23 people called "Late World With Zach" and a couple of recent shows of me struggling on stage in front of drunks.

Also included is some extra footage of me daydreaming.

Thanks for loving me so much."
