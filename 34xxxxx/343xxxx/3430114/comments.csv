Long story short, Zach Galifianakis rules, Windows sucks."

,zzxzx,2010-02-20T07:13Z,"first off... thanks for the awesome upload...

im a huge galifianakis devotee...anything that starts with a gal and ends with a kiss cant be that bad right?

having trouble with this file tho... when viewing the video freezes about 1/3 of the way in.. the audio continues fine.. and if i try to start from the middle it just plays the audio and freezes on the opening image...using vlc as my main player and have also tried windows media... anyone else have this problem? any ideas?

also, on a somewhat unrelated note... is anyone else noticing that pirate bay is acting really weird lately? half the time my computer locks up or shows a virus attack when i log onto TPB...dont have any problems with any other sites

lol are both these problems just me? or my crappy computer hahah?

at any rate thanks again
and zach is my freaking hero"
