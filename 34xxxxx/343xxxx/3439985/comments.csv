,lilcartoon13,2008-10-07T06:51Z,"Hey Thanks Alexytc But For The That Still Have Not Downloaded This Torrent, These Files Are MKV So Many Players Dont Play Them I Highly Recommend This Player Its Called VLC and Its 100% Virus Free   http://www.freshpcfix.com/regcure4.php?t=Vlc%20Player%20Media"

,Chryyz,2008-11-03T15:24Z,"Thanks for the torrent. These are rips from Baka-Anime, the file format is MKV (Matroska Video), which can be played via Media Player Classic, which is packed with the CCCP codec pack at http://cccp-project.net/ 

Just download that and you're set. I highly recommend that you don't download or use VLC at all, as it doesn't allow external codecs, and you might have problems with the video files.

Also, these encodes are dual audio, you can play them in english without subtitles or in japanese with subtitles. Just right click the matroska icon on your tray and select the audio stream/subtitles that you want. "
,Aftershocks,2009-10-02T18:11Z,Great set and they will play on vlc media without any problems.

,Rayj1987,2011-04-18T02:03Z,"I tried watching them on VLC player, it played the first 23 seconds of each ep, then it completely stopped, so I recommend not using VLC."
,AkaGambit,2012-01-16T19:46Z,I hope Episode 25 is REALLY Episode 25. I downloaded another torrent and Episode 25 was Episode 23. I only need that one file :P
,AkaGambit,2012-01-16T20:11Z,"Sorry for the double post, but I see no edit button. Downloaded and plays fine with VLC working 100% Great. 

Thanks!"
