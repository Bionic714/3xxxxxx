       Something has gone wrong at a remote scientific research
       station on Mars. All research has ceased. Communication has
       failed. And the messages that do get through are less than
       comforting. It's a level 5 quarantine and the only souls
       allowed in or out are the Rapid Response Tactical Squad -
       hardened Space Marines armed to the teeth with enough
       firepower to neutralize the enemy... or so they think.

    LMG was nuked for bad res (720x304) also their rls is of questionable quality
    and is very very unlikely it came from a retail source.
    Proper reason:
     - Proper resolution
     - Retail Source
