This is the manual and disks for the PC game x3: reunion by Egosoft(2005)
The manual is in PDF, good quality and is easy to read.
The disks are quite good quality, aprox. 2+ Mb per .jpg file.
Thanks to TEDOX for making this.

The manual is not needed for playing the game, but you will not get fully into it without it as it is a LARGE game.

Enjoy.
