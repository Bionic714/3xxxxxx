,97036,2006-02-01T17:26Z,Does it work or what?
,barchetta1,2006-02-16T18:55Z,"varför kommer det inte upp en ruta om att man ska ringa det där numret?? det funkade utan det..??

Step 2: disable the network settings and jump into the page for phone activation.
Step 3: Type '0' for all of the spaces provided for the activation key except the last three ones which have to change into 365. (e.g.: 000000,00000,00000,00000,000365)
when you do the activation put 999 when you put 365 and you get subscription for 2457 days. wow this is great. tested and works"
,barchetta1,2006-02-16T19:20Z,Activation failed står det och även problem med produktnyckeln..funkar ej..
,robban12,2006-02-24T12:00Z,"Jag har tankat denna för ett tag sen o allt funkade men va fan, nu kommer det en ruta, ""Trial time is out"". Aha, det stod ju över 2000 dagar? va fan tog dem dagarna vägen?"

I natt opplevde jeg å få den samme meldinga, og det er det mange som har. Tilfeldig at alle får sin Norton deaktivert i dag, den 24.02?"

But after the first time LiveUpdate is run, the program deactivates, and you are stuck with no protection...

Will have to wait for the braintrusts to release a version with keygenerator"
