,lee369,2007-12-29T05:09Z,Thank you for this. I just found it today. Did you ever get dvd 2? I don't see a listing for it. Thanks. Looking forward to seeing this.
,caboxander,2012-01-21T22:49Z,I'm new to PB and greatly appreciate all contributors but if anyone reads this who has this file could you PLEEEESE seed for just a little while longer? I'm at 95.5% for the last three days and I promise to seed for a couple of weeks.
