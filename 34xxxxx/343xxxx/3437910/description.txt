Bursting out of the speakers like a comet out of the sky is the heavy metal shred of Chilean guitarist Alejandro Silva, and his group, on his second solo CD, Dios Eol. The song titles may be in Spanish, but no translation is required to enjoy the eleven relentlessly energetic, all instrumental tracks. Silva's guitar strikes with jagged precision - he is capable of delivering a lightning-fast cascade of notes, and, just as quickly, bring it down to wring out slow, soulful melodic or wah-enhanced leads. This kind of dynamicism makes the music on Dios Eol stand out from the pack - you'll get power, musicianship, aggressiveness and searing heavy metal riffs in this superb one hour package. Second guitarist Cristobal Arriagada also contributes noteworthy solos to "Chomo-Lungma", "ERrock" and "El Sexto Mensajero". Instrumental Guitar (Electric (Heavy)/Heavy Metal/Shred), total running time, 58:39


This guy is one of the best guitar heroes from my country (CHILE), i just wanted to share the sheer awe of his instrumental disc  DIOS EOL.
if you like please consider buying it because this guy is no millionaire, he is independent  and his  stuff is not that expensive.
He's  been on stage with the likes  of satriani and paul gilbert, and often enough has schooled some of the  most famous guitarplayers in the world.

hope you enjoy.
