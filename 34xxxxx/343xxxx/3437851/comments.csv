,Nottinghill,2007-02-14T21:55Z,"No chance to install. It ask for a ""Old"" serial a new one. None of the combinations XOXOXOXOX works... Can anyone help?"
,ElMarrego,2007-06-29T16:29Z,"Ignore the previous posts. It definetly works, just _carefully_ read the included .nfo. It contains the the two serials required."
,dietcoke1,2007-11-02T20:11Z,"I've downloaded the 11 files. When I try to unpack it with Unrar, I get a message the file settings.dmg is damaged. I checked the data integrity with Azureus, and it says the file is fine. Any ideas? Thanks!"
,Mitterand,2007-11-25T06:18Z,Great job! Don't forget to check the .nfo for the serials
,booth.robert.e,2008-01-23T01:12Z,"Keep it easy...the first pw you need is 205805515. the second is 205905515. It works perfect. I think.

If you like it buy it. I did. The newer version is even better."
,booth.robert.e,2008-01-23T01:13Z,"dietcoke...
