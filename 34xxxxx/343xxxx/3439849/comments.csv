,dstar2,2010-03-26T14:09Z,"This game is simply amazing. This is one of the best games I've played in a long time. The control scheme is a bit awkward for the first 15 minutes, but it becomes second nature after that (Go to options and select the alternate control scheme). If you liked STALKER, System Shock 2 or Arcanum, you'll love this one - it's an amazing RPG.

Worked out of the box for me, very highly recommended."

,cl0ckwerk,2011-08-14T15:27Z,"Since you won't get a game manual when you download this game, I thought i'd help out and explain some controls that are confusing. First of all, interacting with objects does not work in the standard ""walk up to something and push an action button"" way. When you are close enough to an object so that its name appears, hold down the left mouse button and push a directional key (almost always just whatever you have assigned as ""forward"" although i think some objects do different things if you push other directions) you can think of it like grabbing the object with left mouse button, and using it with directional keys. talking to people works the same way. target with left mouse, interact with forward key. the standard button to draw a weapon is spacebar, but you have to equip it first by pushing tab, highlighting the weapon you want, then hold left mouse and push forward key. by the way, all items in your inventory are used the same way. once you've drawn your weapon, you can swing it by running forward and clicking left mouse, but this type of attack is clumsy and not a good idea against enemies unless you just want to kill them quickly and aren't worried about getting hit. when fighting something stronger, it's usually a better idea to get into fighting stance by standing still and holding left mouse. from here you have four different moves, which are controlled by the directional keys. left swings your weapon from the left side, right swings from the right, up swings high, and down makes you block. blocking doesn't seem to make enemies do less damage, but makes them far less likely to hit. i recommend trying to dodge their attacks rather than block them by letting go of left mouse and strafing out of the way, although as long as you're mixing up your attacks (don't just hit up over and over like i did when i first started, it's much slower and you get hit all the time) you should be able to keep most enemies stunned, provided they don't dodge your attacks. searching bodies of dead enemies works like interacting with objects. when you search them it will open their inventory and yours. to move items from their inventory to yours, simply hold left click and push right. selling objects to vendors works much the same way but, and this is important, just because your giving your stuff to them does NOT mean he's paying you for them. you have to move objects or ore from their store as well as objects from your inventory into the middle until the values at the top are either equal, or the value of what you're giving him is higher. he won't do the trade if the number on his side is higher than the number on your side. I didnt understand this when i started playing, and i accidentally gave away tons of items to vendors without getting anything in return. some vendors don't carry money, and most don't carry more than 200 ore, so don't count on being able to sell more than 200 ore worth of stuff to one vendor. finding the old camp and the swamp camp is easy, but finding the new camp is tricky, and much more difficult to figure out. from my experience, joining old camp is like easy mode, joining swamp camp is medium, and new camp is hard, but it doesn't make much of a difference later on. in old and new camps you can become a mage (fire or water) and use magic or a fighter type (guard or mercenary) which don't use magic, but in swamp camp you can only become a templar, which uses some magic, but also uses weapons. that should be enough info to get you started. i won't say any more because part of the fun of the game is how difficult everything is to figure out. this game does not baby you. if you think people in the game will be nice and explain everything to you, you are wrong. you have to figure out how to become different jobs on your own, especially in the new camp, where everyone is trying to take advantage of you."
,tpb4l,2011-09-29T19:43Z,"Game works fine, thx for the torrent.

Also a big thanks to cl0ckwerk, I was wondering how to actually play it xD"
,Kaapola,2012-02-05T21:27Z,"cl0ckwerk, it's nice someone takes time to write some instructions on the game for others, but I couldn't help noticing a few mistakes in that, and I'm sure you won't mind me correcting it a bit.


Instead of the left mouse button, it's also possible by default to use control + up arrow key to interact, and control + any arrow keys to attack. This is a bit more user-friendly, since using both hands on the same side of your keyboard (as in, one hand on the mouse and the other on the arrow keys) is a bit awkward and the reason why most RPGs use WASD instead of the arrow keys for movement. Gothic uses the arrow keys since it's designed to be played entirely without the mouse.

As to choosing your weapon, instead of tab you can simply use the hotkeys 1 to 0; 1 is your melee weapon, 2 is your ranged weapon, 3 is your last used spell and 4 to 0 are your assigned spells. Pressing space will unsheath your last used weapon, or sheath any weapon you currently have unsheathed. Sheathing and unsheathing actually happen faster while standing still, too, and pressing the hotkey for a different weapon will sheath your currently equipped one and then automatically unsheath the one you called up.

Another fundamental thing about combat: when fighting non-hostile humans (this is to say, humans that won't attack you on sight, such as bandits) you won't actually die, just get knocked unconscious if you lose the fight (and get robbed of your ore and weapon). The same applies to non-hostile humans you bring down; they're merely unconscious and will soon get up again (however both you and the NPCs can stab an unconscious victim to death while he's down, which NPCs will only do for a very good reason though). In saying this I'm just trying to point out that you can feel free to get into brawls, most of the time you won't do irrepairable damage.

As to blocking and dodging, blocking will only work when fighting enemies equipped with melee weapons. Monster attacks will always get through a block. Strafing can work, but only against single enemies. Often it's best to just keep on smashing (not forgetting the cooldown in between hits, obviously).

After playing through the game 4 times I would say joining the swamp camp is quite a bit harder than the new camp, though. The quests are more clear, but also far more challenging. That's subject to personal opinion though. Coming to think of it, even the old camp requires more effort than the new camp, but I still agree the old camp is the easiest."
,OverlordAlexndr,2012-03-04T19:30Z,runs perfectly. thanks phreakd
