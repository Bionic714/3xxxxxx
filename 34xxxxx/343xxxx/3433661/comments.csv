,excelsior55,2006-01-27T04:52Z,"FYI HBO and Co has a habit of screwing with Rome torrents.  This results in bad data swarming around.  This has happened on multiple (I should say the majority even some private trackers) Rome torrents before both individual episodes and collections.  Peerguardian software can help block these as the almost all of the IPs are in their database.

Not 100% sure if that is the problem this time but it has been an issue a lot."
[V],hansIb,2006-01-29T17:20Z,"Don´t worry about 99,9 %. When it´s Xvid, DivX or avi files. Just burn it."
,lavadusch,2006-01-30T09:07Z,Kanske lite korkad fråga men....kan man spela upp xvid -formatet på en vanlig dvdspelare när man väl har bränt ner den på en dvdskiva.?.?.?

,Tyralion,2006-07-27T20:11Z,Fogel: And why would you want to use anything else than VLC? :)
,mixxenator,2006-07-28T22:08Z,"Thanx for a good torrent!

Problem with VCL:

,sirzeppo,2006-09-27T20:57Z,"How do i get the subtitles to work 
i am a rookie so please halp me."
,mike_goteborg,2006-10-02T06:01Z,"Instruktioner:

1 - Skapa lämpligen en ny mapp för varje avsnitt
2 - Markera alla filer i respektive avsnitt (behöver ej ta med mappen sample eller .nfo-filen)
3 - Högerklicka nu på de markerade filerna och klicka på ""Extract files"" - Välj rätt avsnittsmapp du nyss skapat
4 - Nu ser du avsnitten i otextad .avi-format.

Om du vill lägga till Textning... - Enkelt...

1 - Klicka på mappen Subtitles
2 - Markera aktuellt avsnitt
3 - Högerklicka på den markerade filen och klicka på ""Extract files"" - Välj rätt avsnittsmapp du nyss skapat
4 - Döp om text-filen så den får SAMMA namn som .avi-filen (med filändelsen .srt istället för .avi)
5 - Klart att titta på avsnittet eller bränna ut på skiva
