Played OK for me...

,dordo,2006-02-02T18:42Z,There is sameone that have a working serial for the patches 1.40 1.50 and 1.60 of the War in the Pacific ?
,MediaMogul,2007-05-03T18:09Z,odd once the two intro movies have run all i get is a black screen and sound.
,MediaMogul,2007-05-04T05:38Z,"found out what it was. the 3rd intro movie is shitty long and had trouble running on my comp for some reason. 

if you have same problem go to your 
C:\Matrix Games\War Plan Orange\VIDEO
folder locatet he one named intro.avi delete it or put it in a seperat backup folder. 

Then copy and paste one of teh other movies and name it intro. The game will then just run that video insted of the longer kinda bugged one. 

and voila all fixed. im sure you could run any .avi file as part of the intro this way kekekekeke"
