     The Year is 1922.  World War 1 has come and gone  and  the  world  has
     settled into an uneasy peace.  The alliance between the United  States
     and the other powers is weak as the powers try to  maintain  peace  in
     Europe.  Fearful of the growing strength of Japan, the  United  States
     created a series of plans in case of a pacific war with Japan.   Their
     name:  War Plan Orange.  Consisting of three different scenarios,  War
     Plan Orange was a comprehensive and real life "What if"  scenario  for
     the war in the pacific.  In the world  of  Matrix  Games  a  different
     story is going to unfold, and Japan, seeking natural resources to grow
     their power, will turn the full strength of  their  navy  against  the
     industrial giant of the United States.

     Enter War Plan Orange:  Dreadnoughts in the Pacific  1922-1930,  where
     you will command the pacific fleet for either power in four  different
     campaigns.  The two major campaigns will take you from 1922 - 1926 and
     from 1926 - 1930.  With incredible attention to detail and  historical
     accuracy, War Plan Orange is the perfect modification to  War  in  the
     Pacific for anyone who loves the time period between World War  1  and
     World War 2.  The lack of airpower and inefficient fuels, as  well  as
     the natural resources required by both sides make War  Plan  Orange  a
     completely different experience.

     Additionally there are two PBEM scenarios included,  making  War  Plan
     Orange powerful enough to stand on its own, as  well  as  one  of  the
     largest mods and expansions to be released for any game.  War  in  the
     Pacific fans will rejoice and newcomers  will  stand  in  awe  of  the
     tactical battles that will be waged in one of the greatest  wars  that
     never was (or at least, never was until more than a decade later).
