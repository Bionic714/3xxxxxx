Release Notes:

Incredible work from vocalist Cecilia Stalin -- a singer you may know from her
work with Koop, but a far greater artist on her own! This has Cecilia really
fleshing out the groove she first explored on "Waltz For Koop" -- a spacious,
soulful mode that brings together older modes of scatting and vocals with a
freshly jazzy sensibility -- one that's clearly tuned on the tones of the
current club jazz underground, but which also has a lot more to offer than
strictly dancefloor jazz! There's a depth here that's really tremendous -- a
quality that easily puts the record at a level with some of our favorite jazz
vocal work from older years -- including albums by Carmen Lundy, Dee Dee
Bridgewater, and others. But Cecilia's also got an ear for the fresher sounds of
the 21st century too -- and although the album's an all-acoustic, jazz-based
set, it's sure to cross over nicely with fans of Koop and others from the
European scene! Titles include "Bogaloo Boy", "Lover's Bolero", "Straight Up",
"Everything Must Change", "Sustain", "Fast Food", and "Simplicity".
