,kevincad23,2006-08-25T05:30Z,i finally figured it out.the only way you can get this running is with a dvd-r dl disc.works perfectly in  my macbook computer for resetting the admin password and such.thanks
,amateeke,2006-09-30T01:35Z,"This shit is not working for any macbook or macbook pro.  First of all to get this working u need double layer dvd to burn on. Secondly u cant boot this. only with iMac.

U can access this cd from macboook / pro but not boot and iinstall. so its useless for macbook users (intel)

Plz Reply Fast!"
,sandwichbagz,2012-02-05T04:38Z,"To anyone asking for disc 2....there isn't one. This is a 4 GB OS X 10.4 Tiger install DVD for a specific model of Intel iMac. Any CD multi disc versions are for POWERPC and cap out under 3 GB. I have downloaded this file multiple times and it does work.

THIS IS NOT A WINDOWS ACCESSABLE FILE. IT IS A DMG ENCODED HFS PARTITION THAT IS ONLY READABLE BY MACS. BY USING ANY WINDOWS SOFTWARE, I.E. NERO OR ULTRAISO YOU SHOULD QUICKLY REALIZE THAT THE CONTENTS ARE INACCESSABLE WHETHER OR NOT YOU CAN ""BURN"" THE DISC IMAGE FILE. TO INSTALL ON ANY HARDWARE YOU WILL NEED ACCESS TO A MACINTOSH!!!

Any unsupported Mac or x86 machines will require that you ""show all files"" once booted into OS X (or through Target Disk Mode on another Mac) and click on the OSinstall.mpg under system/install. It will guide you from there. Just make sure you have a clean, bootable partition using Disk Utility. Hope I could help."
,alextrex,2012-05-03T03:11Z,"So yeah, this took me way to long to figure out all the details after I downloaded the .dmg.  I'm going to save some poor sucker some time.

First covert the .dmg to a .iso.  Use terminal for this.  Here is the command. 

hdiutil convert ~/Desktop/'filename.dmg' -format UDTO -o ~/Desktop/'filename.iso'

Then, once you've converted it to an .iso, drag and drop it into disc utility, then select burn from the file.  You have to burn it this way for it to work.  (I tired burning it straight up and with Toast)  Also, you have to you the DVD+or-R DL (double layer).

Hope this helps some n00b like me."
