"Interesting release. The Spanish group Neuronium, consisting of Michel Huygen and Carlos Guirao at that time, jammed with Vangelis in Nemo Studios one day in 1981. A Spanish TV show covered this session, and video copies of this show exchange hands amongst collectors. Out of nowhere, in 1992, Michel Huygen officially releases one of the jams and calls it "In London". The jam is released as a 8:53 track. It reminds me of the other infamous jam sessions that Vangelis fought for removal from the market (those being Hypothesis and The Dragon). In 1996, Michel Huygen re-released this jam session again, under the name "A Separate Affair". This release consisted of three remixes of the original jam: The Psychotronic Mix (20:00), The After Hours Mix (12:56) and The Radio Mix (3:03).
