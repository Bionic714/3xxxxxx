,onehotmong,2006-01-25T15:38Z,There is no serial packed with this - it says serial box has one... It doesnt!! :S
,onehotmong,2006-01-25T15:48Z,"ok - the serial isnt needed to play single player, but this will break the nocd crack for call of duty 1, so dont install this if you want to play cod 1 again"
,onehotmong,2006-01-25T15:51Z,"riiiiight, if you delete your original call of duty SP after installing this, then reinstall the SP  of cod1 it will work again... magic :)"

,unsui,2006-04-11T23:44Z,"Men kan vi inte göra en väntelista så man kan få spela lite onlajn, serienumret som finns i Surfers funkar, men bara om ingen annan är uppkopplad samtidigt med samma serial.

Jag röstar för väntelista ;-)"

,Frede007,2007-03-05T21:09Z,whow to mount?
,mikethejones,2007-03-09T08:52Z,"    Install Toast Titanium 7 or 8 and choose to install the ""toast and mount"" menu items. Restart your Mac and repair preferences.  Find the .dmg you want to mount.  Right-click on the .dmg and choose Mount It.  A picture of a disk will appear in the top section of the Finder Sidebar.  Most of the time, this takes care of the no-cd, as well as allowing you to install games. "

,jimmytwohats,2008-01-09T22:42Z,"I just realized that ""United Offensive"" is an expansion pack. This torrent doesn't included the original Call of Duty? Do I need the original game to use this torrent and play??"
,jimmytwohats,2008-01-10T00:35Z,Is this the full game??
,emopig,2008-03-20T18:00Z,THOSE WITH NORMAL PC DONT DOWNLOAD THIS !!.. ITS FOR MAC.. MEANS COMPUTER FOR FUCKTARDED IDIOTS !.. GET PC FUCKHEADS !
,wizzoh,2008-05-23T06:49Z,"Opening the .dmg file should be no trouble, double click to mount the disk image, or mount it with Toast.

If it isn't working and isn't recognised, your main problem could be that you aren't using a mac."
,VileCore,2008-06-12T07:02Z,"All you PC idiots who downloaded it thinking it was for PC: Doesn't ""Games > Mac"" mean ANYTHING to you?
If computers don't have walls or fences, who needs Windows and Gates?"
,VileCore,2008-06-19T06:28Z,"Oh, and Emopig: Go back to slashing your wrists and listening to gay music, you Windows-using tool."

,dafser,2008-12-10T19:52Z,"he sure were owned...

I have been searchin for a crack file for mac but I was pretty unsuccessful I found just one; http://www.usenext.de/index.cfm?TD=402066&sESR=LykwJkxSTi80VVA7VVZKTS1fXTc%2FCg%3D%3D&SCT=KCFNXl4%2FPzMuLkhYIAo%3D
 Its a mirror from another site but here comes the bad news... you have to sign a membership together with a paypal account (wich I myself dont have) to achieve your account.
however you could quit the account in about 14 days , doing it all for free. let me hear if you download it..."
,desquishybanana,2008-12-29T00:19Z,"emopig is right about mac, it sucks, there's little to no programs for it, it's confusing as hell if u have used Windows first. mac is a poorly done rip off of windows, its vista trying to act like windows 95 thats trying to act like windows 2000 that trys to act like windows xp that trys to act like a retard trying to eat horse shit. sure vista isn't all glory full but it still beats mac, u go have fun playing freecell and solitaire, i am going to go play halo and CoD and other games, hell, does mac have freecell and solitaire? when u buy a mac computer, remove apple from it and put XP on it, else wards just put a gun to ur balls and fire, then beat urself to death with a riffle bat."
