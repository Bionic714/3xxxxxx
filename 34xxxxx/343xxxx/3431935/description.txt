Burn this onto DVDR using your favourite DVD burning software - 
if you don't know how to burn these onto DVDR's, get Nero and search
on Google.  Then print the DVD Cover and DVD Inlay Booklet (oh yes
you get this too).

I noticed that some of the colour versions are slightly shorter
than the B&W versions.  In Brats, for example, you'll see that
some small scenes were cut out of the colour version and so is
shorter than the restored B&W version.  Brats is on DVD Vol 5.
Note that colourised versions are not as sharp as the B&W versions,
although this is normal if you've ever seen a L&H colourised
version before.
