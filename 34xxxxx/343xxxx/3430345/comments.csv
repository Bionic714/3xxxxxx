,Foxxen,2006-01-11T08:02Z,Why do you need a hack for this? I would recommend Folder Lock which you can find here: http://thepiratebay.org/details.php?id=3407149 Whith this program you can protect your files/folders whith three different levels of security. The highest even makes it invisible in DOS mode/safe mode.
,FALCON3X11,2006-01-11T11:42Z,THIS IS BETTER THAN FOLDER LOCK
,gasman364,2006-02-14T01:13Z,"No, it's not better than folder lock.  In large part because the install program doesn't work."
