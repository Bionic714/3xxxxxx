Razed in Black is a great industrial/darkwave act from Hawaii on indy label Cleopatra.  I haven't seen much of this floating around the torrent sites so I thought I would try introducing it into the mix.  There are four albums and a smattering of misc covers and random tracks, all various bitrates.

This is my first attempt to upload a torrent.  Be gentle :)
