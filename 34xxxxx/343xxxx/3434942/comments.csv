Deaf and blind and dumb and born to follow, what you need is someone strong to use you.. like me. If you want to get your soul to heaven, trust in me .Don't judge or question.You are broken now, but faith can heal you. Just do everything I tell you to do. Deaf and blind and dumb and born to follow. Let me lay my holy hand upon you. My Gods will becomes me. When he speaks out, he speaks through me. He has needs like I do. We both want to rape you. Jesus Christ, why don't you come save my life. Open my eyes and blind me with your light and your lies.  "

We are farther from God (as a society) then we ever have been, and look at where we are at... crime, including rape, is widespread and morals are a thing of the past.  ""Do what feels good.""  OK, hope you have fun burning in hell.  "

Never heard of the 'Dark Ages' do you? ? What did religion bring those days ?? With all the shit that's happening today, wouldn't like to go back to that time. Keep living with your eyes wide shut, and let fool yourself by religions. "

What did economics bring? Explotation, depression
What did Jesus bring... mission hospitals, freedom, justice for woman, the poor. Salvation.
Man is his own worst enemy."
