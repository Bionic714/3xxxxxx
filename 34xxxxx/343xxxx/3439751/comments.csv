Not to say serials aren't nice but would just like to know if there is any info on where I could get the sceneries from? Specifically interested in Budapest and Male"

,Irukandji,2006-02-05T20:32Z,"Well with everyone bitching all the time, i think that i will most likely stop posting anything at all... Freeware or payware... i only upload things that i think that people might like to have, whether you pay for it or not. I have tons ( nearly 123GB) of things that i have bought for FS2004 excluding the flight one stuff. But i think for now i will halt all uploads for a while"

,MrJalla,2006-02-07T14:31Z,"Wasn't bitching, I'm really sorry if you understod it that way... on the contrary I am very greatful for your postings. I just did not know how to get the install files and wanted to know how to... btw. the serials in this pack that I tried worked like a charm..."
