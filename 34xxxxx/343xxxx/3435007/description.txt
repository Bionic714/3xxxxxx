The Beatles Complete HTML contains all "The Beatles" songs plus more from John &
Paul  all  in HTML  format  (Internet Explorer)  For  users who  have  Quicktime
installed it would be best to uninstall it as this program looks for Winamp  and
if Quicktime  is installed  it will  take over  the whole  page ....  it is also
designed to work with  a screen resolution of  1280 x 1024 ....any  less and the
gfx will be to large  any more and the gfx will be to small....also its best  to
hit F11  in exploer  to go  to full  screen so  as to  enable a full screen view
...from the main  page which shows  all the albums  you can go  to all the other
pages that contain all the songs and albums ...you are given a choice of viewing
the lyrics  for each  song and  a play  all icon  on each  page ... if you are a
Beatles fan then this is a  must as I think it is  the only one of its kind  (as
far as I know) It was prepared a few years ago now and the code may be a  little
out of date but it is still great ... after all the Beatles will never age  ....
not in my book anyway....    
                         ... as they say ... ENJOY ----!
