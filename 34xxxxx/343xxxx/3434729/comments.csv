,KUKAL,2008-04-25T13:00Z,"Hello homeles, 
I want to deeply thank you for this piece of soft that save me out a big big trouble, I deleted 2 Gb of unreplaceable pics, and i was able to recover them all from the SD card in less than 10 min with Data Recovery !! thanks again, I would like to make a donation if possible to your cause... also I got some trouble finding the s/n for two of the appl in the package, one is Netware for mac OS and the other is Picture Rescue 1.1.0, for the Netware is there but is invalid and for pic rescue is not S/n, I was wondering if I had to look some where else perhaps.

Thanks very much for your generosity, I'm really grateful for this homeles.
