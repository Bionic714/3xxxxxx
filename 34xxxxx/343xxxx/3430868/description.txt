In the early 1950's, the threat of Communism created an air of         
paranoia in the United States and exploiting those fears was Senator   
Joseph McCarthy of Wisconsin. However, CBS reporter Edward R. Murrow   
and his producer Fred Friendly decided to take a stand and challenge   
McCarthy and expose him for the fear monger he was. However, their     
actions took a great personal toll on both men, but they stood by       
their convictions and helped to bring down one of the most             
controversial senators in American history.
