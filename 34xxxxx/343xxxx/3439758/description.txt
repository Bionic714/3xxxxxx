GROUP NEWS

 TCM loves TV. That's the reason we are doing what we do.
  
 If you would like to join us we are currently recruiting the following:

 - HDTV/PDTV cappers. You must have a decently fast upload and at least 
   one fast PC.
 - Digital cappers for non-digital source (i.e. DSR) Same requirements apply
   for upload speed and PC as above.

   We can teach you how to cap if you are a novice,  but you must be willing 
   to cap regularly, really love TV, and be all around a cool person,
   since we will be spending a lot of time together.  
   
 - Anything else that is legal that may help us. However - 
   we are not looking for suppliers, site affiliations,or dumps, so 
   please don't bother asking. 

   We do not respond with technical questions about our releases or tell you 
   where to get them.
