,Davidphill150,2006-01-23T13:23Z,"FYI ""pennyxlane"" Learn, to read the INFORMATION given on the movie ESPECIALLY the part that says Spoken language(s): ""Spanish"" Let that be a Fucking Clue Dumb ass, as to the Spoken language of the film  DUUUH! Then you wont leave stupid comments like ""fuck! why is it in spanish for? :| "" Now you know!"
,cantormath,2006-01-24T23:28Z,"Yeah this is totally in spanish, should have said that in the description.....but whatever, these things happen.  On the other hand, this has got to be the worst audio from a screener I have ever seen.
Good try though."
,luckylopez,2006-01-25T22:02Z,Davidphill: Pennyxlane was just asking WHY it was in spanish. He did not ask IF it was in spanish.  (And indeed why the fuck IS it in spanish?) So you 'learn' to read a question before you start being an asshole. Shut up. Fuck people like you.

Fuck you Davidphill! This crap sucks!"
