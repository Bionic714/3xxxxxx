,iduntomat,2006-04-01T16:09Z,"Sorry.. But I don't understand how to use the file. Do I need to read the ""cd"" i a DVD program or something?"
,Arnold S,2006-04-03T21:22Z,"Hi iduntomat.
You need daemon tools. You can serch it from google

Then you mount file with daemon tools and then there is a new dvd in my computer. Then run it and enjoy.

You can also burn the file to dvd with nero."
