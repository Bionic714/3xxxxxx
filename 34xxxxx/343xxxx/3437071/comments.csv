,Johnny5555,2006-01-30T14:51Z,"I downloaded this and when I mount with Alcohol to install I get a runtime error and the setup says abnormal termination, and it stops the installation.

Anybody else have this major corruption that prevents english install???"
,garagna,2006-01-30T21:32Z,"As Johnny5555 ""the setup says abnormal termination, and it stops the installation."", french install, but it said that "" need windows XP"", odd because my system is Win xp (pro), not 3.1!!!

If Someone succeed in install this, could you post the trick, please ?!"
