,juan_delgado,2006-02-01T23:39Z," oh my....this is a cruel movie, many thanks Kegir!"
,deadmeadow3,2006-02-04T19:57Z,"hi kegir, do you have glauber rocha's ""a idade da terra"" ?"
,kegir,2006-02-04T20:36Z,"No, the only other Rocha i have is ""Dragão da Maldade contra o Santo Guerreiro, O"""
,deadmeadow3,2006-02-05T06:16Z,great could you post it later? will be very aprecciated. thx
,kegir,2006-02-05T16:23Z,"deadmeladow3, the problem with ""Dragão da Maldade contra o Santo Guerreiro, O"" is that  i don't have any subs for it and that it is a Tv-rip from Rai with hardcoded Italian subs. The quality is ok but with no subs it's kind of hard to understand.  "
,deadmeadow3,2006-02-06T12:50Z,"im brazilian,no problem about it. thx"
,kegir,2006-02-06T20:15Z,"I didn't know you where from Brazil. Ok, I upload it before you see the first trio eléctrico. That give me about two and a half week. This morning it was 15 minus degrees in stockholm. I was in Brazil this day 9 years ago and the weather not so bad there.  "
,deadmeadow3,2006-02-07T01:30Z,"thx kegir :) . there no dvd version of this movie yet,so any source are welcome. we're having one of the most hot years,about 34 degrees every day"
,Bluesoul,2006-02-10T22:06Z,"Tripplesix, normally you should have subtitle options enabled in your media player (if it supports srt/sub subtitles) but i really advise you to use/install one of these media players which autoload subtitles and can easily handle them in every possible way ;)
