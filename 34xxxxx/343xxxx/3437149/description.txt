An amazing display of talent form a not so well known classical guitarist. Marc Rizzo is recognized for his work with heavy metal band Ill Nino, but this is a complete departure from the distorted power chords and crunching low tones he is used to playing. While there is some electric guitar weaved into a few of the tracks it is mainly all classical acoustic playing. A must have for any fan of great guitar work.
