,a7913824650,2008-04-16T16:59Z,"too much leechers i stop seeding, but rather seed http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3395422/All_Ranma_Mangas , for you guys with incomplete file uncompress with winrar with keep broken files option, lot of errors would come out but start http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3395422/All_Ranma_Mangas on the same folder and it would only download missing pieces. (at least in theory)"

,Estaj,2009-03-11T01:20Z,"Great torrent defrostedtuna.  Torrented it in half a day, and every file works great.  Its the whole collection up 'till the end seeders.  Surprisingly all in JPEG, so you can just view them in windows  image viewer.  You don't need CDisplay or anything.

Thanks again mate."
