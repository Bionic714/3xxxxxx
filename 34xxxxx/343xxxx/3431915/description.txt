These are the complete Ranma mangas. There are two older sets of them here at tbp, but they have been unseeded for some time.

If you haven┬┤t seen the Anime, I suggest you do. It is avaible for download here at tbp.

If you have seen the anime, here you have the manga behind. Many of the episodes are not in the manga, and many of the chapters are not in the anime. Most importantly, unlike the anime, the manga has an ending. A great big final saga with an actual ending to the series.

Unlike the two tards before me, I intend to seed this. I will seed it 24h/day for starters, and if you stumble upon it unseeded in the future you can send me a mail.

And no complaining about me not seeding untill the tracker updates.
