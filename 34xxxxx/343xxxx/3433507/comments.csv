Here is a little extra info on the site:
""The Internet Archive is a 501(c)(3) non-profit that was founded to build an Internet library, with the purpose of offering permanent access for researchers, historians, and scholars to historical collections that exist in digital format. Founded in 1996 and located in the Presidio of San Francisco, the Archive has been receiving data donations from Alexa Internet and others. In late 1999, the organization started to grow to include more well-rounded collections. Now the Internet Archive includes texts, audio, moving images, and software as well as archived web pages in our collections."""
,muddyh2o,2008-08-22T13:59Z,"zaftra- the rar file is screwed (that's a technical term)  nothing seems to be able to unrar all of it so several discs (some of vol 31 and all of 32 and 33) are missing.

can you rearchive and reseed pls?"
