IGN Score 3.3"
,tuckdragon,2007-11-04T16:55Z,lmao noobs... why ign gave it that low is cuz they only played the singelplayer witch sux it is only meanth for unlocking things for the online game witch onws. this is prolly a fixed exe that makes it abel to write all symbols and maybe remove those pain in the azz errors.
,Elkabeln,2007-11-24T11:11Z,"hope so,i cant even check ""my clan"" option cuz of the game crashes every time(just got an inv from a clan and i cant even accept).."
,tuckdragon,2007-12-23T01:21Z,yea then u would need a fixed exe... but now u cant  get this 1 cuz there is no seeders :S
