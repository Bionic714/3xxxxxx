,Loki1391,2006-01-20T08:51Z,"Install it as a demo version, once it is installed, attempt to save, this will bring up the activation screen. Proceed from there."

,buckethed,2006-04-20T00:26Z,"This is a full valid version of autocad revit 8.1. The file size looks small, and I about passed it up because of that, but what it did was downloaded everything it needed from Autodesk. In the end it was almost 700 MB. Serial and Keygen works, I have full commercial with no expiration, follow directions. After install is complete, firewall it off. Good Show Loki"
