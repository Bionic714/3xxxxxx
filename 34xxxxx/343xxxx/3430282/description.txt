You probly know what everything of those do.
But maybe not "Steam-down", it is very useful (if you ain't want to be uplink with steam all the time, or you just maybe want to play all the games from steam).

I'm not the goodest on kind of things (messing with steam you know).
But I included a bunch of tutorials (can get a lot of handy, when you using it).


So much else isn't there...

Hope it works!!
Pease out yo!
