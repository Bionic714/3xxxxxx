,Childofbodom608,2008-02-07T05:01Z,he didnt really write a summary but i will let everyone know the quality and sound is great and it has the commercials and the half time show
,big_daddy_rich,2008-06-08T14:22Z,"i dunno which video/clip you are, but the sound quality is flat-out shitty. video is decent, but nothing to brag about. if you're a big SB fan, i guess....but otherwise, don't waste your time on this."
