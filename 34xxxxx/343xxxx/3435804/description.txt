   INFORMATION:

   Please read the complete Changelogs to keep yourself informed.
   Some features might still be in their initial development stages ...
   You can find some Troubleshooting Tips further down this document.

   SKINS INCLUDED:

   Original Project Mayhem III Skin from CVS only.
   It guarantees everything works perfectly and keeps Releases Small & Clean.
   This skin is constantly changed and updated. I you want to use other skins,
   make sure they are suitable for this particular CVS Version of XBMC.
   Don┬┤t ask me about problems with 3rd Party Skins - You┬┤re on your own here !

   The only thing that┬┤s changed is the look of the Webserver Interface.
   I replaced the Original with the Project Mayhem III Style Webserver Interface
   from KanadaKid (Scott). Looks very nice ┬┤coz it perfectly fits the PM3 style.
   This also adds some small, but cool Functions to the Webserver Interface.

   FlexiBrowser / GameSaves / GameSpotPlus / GameTrailers
   QuickTimeBrowser [fixed] (Movie Trailers) / SubmenuEditor

   VISUALISATION ADDONS INCLUDED (All Zipped):

   G-Force:  1507 total (including the CVS supplied ones)
   MilkDrop: 7977 total (including the CVS supplied ones)
              
   I slightly modified some settings in /visualisations/milkdrop.xml
   The Milkdrop Addon Pack with 7977 Presets is the default setting.
   The original file from CVS has been renamed to milkdrop.xml.CVS

   ABOUT TRAINERS:

   Trainer files need to be in /system/Trainers - Use the context menu on a Game
   listed in MY PROGRAMS to refresh the Trainer List or to change Trainer options. 

   Get Trainers e.g. @ http://trainers.maxconsole.net (Free Registration required)
   Also there are TrainerPacks available for download on the net.

   Note that the new .xbtf Format Trainers do not work in XBMC yet!

   RELEASE NOTES:

   The Xored Trainer Engine is here - Another great gift from the developers !
   Only ONCE included in THIS Release is a bunch of Trainers i collected
   from the net (including Mikerowesoft Packs 1-3). All (binary) dupes have been
   deleted. I absolutely don┬┤t know which ones work and which don┬┤t ! 
   PLEASE do not ask me anything about the included Trainers.
   They are here to give you a start and will not be included in future Releases. 
           
   Added SubmenuEditor Script.
   Now you can get new Scripts via the XBMCScripts menu and directly add them to
   the Submenu yourself - without leaving XBMC ;-)
   THX to Rocko (Rockstar) and alexsolex for this really nice and clean Script !

   CHANGELOG:

   To keep this .nfo shorter, I only list the topmost 3 lines here, so you can
   see what┬┤s included here. Always read the official XBMC Changelog at  
   http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/xbmc/XBMC/Changelog.txt?view=markup
   You can also find it in /docs/Changelog.txt

   24-01-2001 fixed: forgot to add trainer path to xboxmediacenter.xml
   23-01-2006 fixed: checks for skin labels aliases were reaching compiler limits
                     (too much else if's)
   23-01-2006 fixed: <animation> tags in references.xml weren't being used.

   TROUBLESHOOTING TIPS:

   If you are experiencing all kinda weird problems using an updated version
   of XBMC it is always a good idea to delete the XBMC┬┤s "SaveGame"
   using the Micro$oft Dashboard.
   Alternatively, just delete the E:/TDATA/0face008 and E:/UDATA/0face008 dirs.
   This is especially important if you are updating from quite an old version.

   To avoid problems you should also check - with every new release - 
   if the included XboxMediaCenter.xml has been changed significantly.
   You should then update your own customized XboxMediaCenter.xml accordingly.

   If using XBMC as Dashboard, don┬┤t forget to update the files on DRIVE ┬┤C┬┤.

   THANKS:

   All the XBMC developers !!
