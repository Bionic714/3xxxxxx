,ludlow,2006-01-28T10:54Z,"damaninacan, look for and download e.g. IsoBuster (can be found here on TPB) for handling .bin and .cue."
,dan3411,2006-02-05T12:31Z,i have downloaded it but haven't got a clue how to install

,brosee13,2006-02-10T15:00Z,"Anybody find a keygen for this?
Please pass it on if you do
Thanks :)"
,brosee13,2006-02-10T15:04Z,"http://www.cracklib.net/cracks/adobe_audition.v2.0_keygen_196298.html
this might work"
,Noprotein,2006-02-11T19:54Z,"Are any of the *new* meaning version 2.0/7+ adobe ""pro"" versions for real with working keygens? The comments on each are confusing as hell. I'm downloading em but I still can't figure out the exact ways to unpack/crack/ which key to use etc.. any FIRM truthful information is appreciated.

Email me if you'd like"
,brosee13,2006-02-13T04:21Z,i tried with the keygen i posted above and all worked well. i never did try the crack in the file folder. alternative method of activation if the cracks not working.
,brosee13,2006-02-13T04:22Z,"awesome program

thanks ramnam"
,sprec,2006-02-13T13:42Z,"keygen doesn't work
anyone can make it work ????"
,brosee13,2006-02-13T20:09Z,"When you are asked to activate it, select activation options, then over the phone. You will be given your 'activation number'. But no need to call 'em, just copy/past the number into the key-gen and it will give you an auth code..

Enjoy this fine program :)"
,craytek,2006-02-15T05:38Z,How do download this it keeps giving an error ?
,exakt,2006-03-06T15:07Z,HEEEEEEEY  i cant get it to be a full version it says that it will only work in 30 days  how do i make it complete??
,smokingpro,2006-03-08T21:25Z,new audition is cool but there is no crack or real serial to register or activation code. i think we need to wait for the crackers to crack it !:)
,Janei,2006-03-09T15:38Z,Thanks a bunch!

,rackdemon,2006-03-16T07:21Z,"solved my own problem.. and for those of you who are getting that error ""tracker is for torrents on tpb only"" when starting download, try using a different client.  I was using Bit Torrent, and getting the error, tried BitLord, and bam, all good.  Thx for the upload."

[V],lecher,2006-03-31T23:33Z,"thanks for sharing this product... can anyone seed pleas, im stuck at 90,8%. it had been nice if someone did so, thanks."
,MadDickBones,2006-04-21T10:09Z,"Don't bother with this download,
it's a waste of time, why bother putting things on the site for people to download when you havn't even tested to see if it does actually work."
,raw_deale,2006-04-21T14:57Z,"This executable is infected with a trojan, suprisingly the kegen is clean. The actuall installer is infected, DONT download!!!"
[V],josephus,2006-05-19T23:22Z,"Do not download Audition 2.0 it has all the bad things you that they say about Adobe programs. It is slow, takes up a lot of system resources has a lot of non-useful gadgets bad GUI.
Stick with the faster and better written code that comes with Audition 1.5 which is the best version up til now. Believe me I use it everyday in my work,  I've tried them all from when it was Cool Edit pro up til today.
The 2.0 version sucks big time!!!
I installed it and uninstalled it after a few days and reinstalled 1.5 which is the best version so far."
,darBis,2006-05-29T19:14Z,"josephus, i was affraid this will hapen to my precious CoolEdit. Thanks for warning."
,OzzKiNgZ,2006-07-05T01:10Z,"com'n, seed please!"
,biksuni,2006-07-19T22:53Z,Thanks mate!
,BattleCry,2007-04-17T21:57Z,"very true Josephus

Adobe 1.5 is still alot better"
,simenson4,2007-05-31T02:13Z,havent downloaded and tested but it shoud be crack/patch on http://crackspider.us/ but be aware!!! its allot of viruses there
,YO-Q,2008-03-11T12:00Z,is this safe or what?
,Hollissterr,2008-03-20T00:37Z,holy shit seed nukkas
,stygmatik,2008-12-22T23:33Z,"only thing that 2.0 has over 1.5 is the ability to place effects on the master channel so you can play with compression or master eq without having to mix down first...
other than that one little thing, audition 1.5 OWNS this version...stick with 1.5 I agree with all the others its the best one, even better than audition 3...
ive used sonar, live, tracktion, and audition 1.5 kicks their asses too ! "
