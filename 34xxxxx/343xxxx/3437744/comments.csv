,bonsai_proxy,2006-04-15T06:09Z,Good rip. I think I am posting for the same jarhead I downloaded (don't hold me to that!). About 4 times(ish) some writing scrolls across the bottom of the screen saying that this version is only for award consideration. It's a very minor thing and is still very much worth downloading if you want to see this film. Thanks a lot.
,bonsai_proxy,2006-04-15T06:10Z,Also I had no password problem :s
