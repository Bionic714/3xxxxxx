,cklosows,2006-02-07T19:50Z,Don't be a punk and just finish and leave. I know you want to install this but so do the rest of us. Leave the torrent running on another system or something. I'm stuck at 98.9% with 2b/s....that's right 2 BYTES PER SECOND! SEED THIS YOU LEECHERS!
,cklosows,2006-02-08T00:10Z,"OK Again, 99.5% and I'm downloading the last 20MB but it will take me 193 days at this rate. Someone who has finished it just seed until a few of us finish....we will pick up our lame ass slack."
,Menge,2006-02-08T00:11Z,99.5%. waiting for it to finish to start seeding :)
,seaclearly2006,2006-02-08T01:07Z,Just got another PM from Jas saying he is now seeding it.
,sammybk,2006-02-08T01:09Z,Thanks so much for jumping on and seeding!
,bgoda,2006-02-08T01:46Z,"I have FIOS with 2M upload. I always leave Azureus running so if I get the whole thing you'll always have a seeder in New York, NY."
,sammybk,2006-02-08T02:02Z,That hit 40 seeds really really fast!
,seaclearly2006,2006-02-08T02:05Z,I'm still wondering why this site still says one seeder as its easily over 30 now.  I'm just finishing the hash check.
,seaclearly2006,2006-02-08T02:08Z,Its alive its alive.  I'm seeding it in about two minutes as I adjust my upload limits.
,insaneses,2006-02-08T04:08Z,I was stuck at 95% FOR DAYS! I'll seed as long as I can :
,hitzefrei,2006-02-08T07:53Z,"hi,

,amitai,2006-02-08T10:22Z,I have ibm r40 and in won't boot. i can see that it's a mac but it got stuck. the display card is ati. 
,smellycan,2006-02-09T01:08Z,"Any particular reason why there is no keyboard or mouse support after installing this?  Anyone know a terminal command to get past this?  Boots fine, goes to the login screen, and that is it.  No board or squeaker, no login.  This was used as an upgrade, not a fresh install.  Could that be it?"
,the_doc78,2006-02-09T04:22Z,"WTF IS WITH THE RUBBISH DATA??? I've been sitting at 99.8% for more than 14 hours. What the fuck gives? Can someone with a good, 100% complete copy seed? This is ridiculous!"
,JaSsEr,2006-02-09T16:54Z,"First of all read the forums about keyboard and mouse support,Fucking laptops have the worst chance of installing,This was for one type of motherboard and one type only,all other support has been added,turn off legacy usb support in your god damn bios and see if this helps,If not set it to auto,ffs."
,JaSsEr,2006-02-09T21:24Z,"Sorry for going off but if you need any help just go to www.win2osx.net you can find a wealth of information on installing and running osx on your x86 pc,I am active there and accept pm's just pm JaS."

,RobNyc,2006-02-15T15:57Z,"True. I'm being patient. I'm uploading to the max and hope we all do the same. We all seed even after its done so the faster we can download it, the sooner we can use it and join together "
,RobNyc,2006-02-16T03:38Z,"your right.. same problem with me, i have uploaded more than downloaded.. these people are not doing the right thing ="
,RobNyc,2006-02-16T03:39Z,"Actually what should happen is, the slower your upload the slower your download I hope that happens, and also if your not uploading at least 20kb/s make your download slower so people can learn how to share"
,hurdler307,2006-02-16T05:44Z,I'll upload this on UseNext as soon as I'm done.
,RobNyc,2006-02-16T07:01Z,"hey guys. i installed im running fine =] 
but some problems I hear with this install is going on. Safari crashes when you try to go to certain sites, like myspace.com, also ichat crashes. ="
,DragonOrta,2006-02-17T14:07Z,"It looks like I might still be the only seeder. As long as people are still downloading this, I'll keep it up. I'm uploading at 126kb/s."
,carloscarlo,2006-02-19T16:02Z,i hope u fucks appreciate me seeding this download. im not sure if this will work for me but everyone should try to join the cause to make this a stand alone upgrade to our ugly xp machines. adios
,klaupacius,2006-02-22T03:52Z,"8 seeders?  Please guys help out here for the almost 200 peeps (that just like you before you got it, want this file)"
,carloscarlo,2006-02-22T16:33Z,"im so surprised how well this worked for me. everything worked except sound. but i must admit. this download was a total waste of time. i installed it played with it, and now im back on xp. "
,hot_wired13,2006-02-23T00:44Z,"well.. lol. if u have cheap low end mobo's with celerons, u'd be surprised at how well everything just works.. ;)"
,hot_wired13,2006-02-23T00:44Z,"and to be frank, im planning to install them on all of my old servers with Asrock mobos + celeron 2.4's and use xgrid to link em up. muahaha supercomputer. :P"
