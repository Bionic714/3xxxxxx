I took the original disk image (dmg) from:
OSx86 10.4.3 Build 8F1111

Then converted it to ISO and then applied ISO patches:
JaS 8F1111A Generic Patch v4.2b. It includes all relevant Maxxuss patches and
drivers, and allows you to install 10.4.3 8F1111A on any x86 system without hassle.

And this is the resultant ISO file. I have burned it and booted it from a PC
and proceeded to install OS X successfully and was able to get on the net.

This has a working iTunes program, and the other features of 8F1111A are present,
e.g., SSE3 emulation (so just the SSE2 instructions are mandatory).

Please note there are CPUs and motherboards that are incompatible. Please see the
hardware compatibility list in the OSx86Project Wiki at:
