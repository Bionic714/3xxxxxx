Is almost complete (at 99%), once done I will seed for 3 weeks. It is now November 22/07.
I am currently in Western North America, so I may not be able to upload to the European population at an incredible speed. I will up what I can within that 3 week period."

Will seed from here on in for three weeks and 3 wks only."
