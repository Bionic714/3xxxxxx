A great "Best of" Stone Temple Pilots album. The only song that I wish they would have added would be Dead and Bloated. But other then that all the great songs are here and also an acoustic version of Plush.

This will play in iTunes and iPod, and any media player that supports MPEG-4 AAC compression. This is excellent sound quality.
