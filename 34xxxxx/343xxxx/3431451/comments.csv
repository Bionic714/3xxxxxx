That's a very personal song by Amy Lee (not Evanescence), and she doesn't want anybody to listen to it. Some guy hatched her PC and stole all the songs. She has accepted the other songs on the ""album"", Not for Your Ears, to be downloaded, but NOT You.
Support Amy and DO NOT download this torrent, or delete the song (You, that is) after you have downloaded it."
,LeGranDuc,2006-08-14T18:28Z,Evanescence has a new album coming out in november i belive.
,Guib,2006-09-20T03:27Z,"Hey Salamigirl,

Because you said that now I want to download it, even if I didn't have any interest in the song.

Funny how life works, huh?"

,stupid m0nkey,2007-11-20T03:49Z,"you guys are mean, funny but mean"
,stupid m0nkey,2007-11-20T03:50Z,haha jk i'm gonna download this one now too
,stupid m0nkey,2007-11-20T03:56Z,"FYI in the world of illegal downloads ppl don't usually care about someone elses feelings, and find messages such as, this torrent is offensive quite antagonistic as you can tell"
