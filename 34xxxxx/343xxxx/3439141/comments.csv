,doriansavage,2006-02-04T05:16Z,"Hey lylyacul! Two things:

1) Shut your stupid neophyte mouth. Not everyone speaks English, and if you had half a brain you'd notice that this site was based in SWEDEN. It's morons like you that make me ashamed to be an American.

2) If you're not happy with what other people upload, then CONTRIBUTE SOMETHING USEFUL instead of leaving pussy-ass comments on their work. Christ..."

,mickeyB80,2007-12-13T08:42Z,"2 everylittlethingismagic:

,Deznaj,2008-01-08T15:22Z,"MickeyB80, triple WORD on your gay-ass name."
,Tunt3maton,2008-02-08T17:41Z,"just demo, garbage."
,furtherdown,2008-03-02T15:51Z,"English is the best language in the entire world.  That's why you Swedish muppets learn it and why over one billion people have at least a basic knowledge of English.  Even the chinks are learning English.  I think these facts by themselves are enough to tell everyone else to fuck off, without expressly saying it."
,klety,2008-06-26T04:33Z,word!
,Necroclysm,2008-10-06T06:50Z,"tha_specializt: ""in fact, english is the EASIEST language out there ... no complex grammar, no pedantic rules and so forth.""

I have to admit... I laughed pretty hard when I read this, and most of the post.  Especially the last half of the quoted sentence.

Just because some moron is complaining something isn't in English, does not mean he is American.  Notice the second person complaining it isn't in English used the word muppet :p


This release not being in English IS a valid complaint, even if they were assholes about it.
There is nothing in the title or description that lists the spoken/written language.
Despite the website being in Sweden, English IS the chosen default language for the site.  If you release something non-English, please state the language/country code in the title and/or description."
,Necroclysm,2008-10-06T06:51Z,"""Even a 10-year old can learn this language""?  You do understand that learning a new language is easier the younger you are... right?



""English definitely isnt ""the best"" language, because there is no ""best"" language at all, my young friend ;-)""
Only thing I agree with here."
,countersweet,2008-11-08T13:14Z,"haha, yet another morons arguing on the internet

by the way, this release is shit, it's just default demo installer and there's some wallpaper of ""zuzana"" thrown in, has nothing to do with the actual program"
