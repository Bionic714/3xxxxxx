,thenumberthirteen,2010-06-15T14:16Z,"To those getting the ""Insert Disk"" error. Did you have trouble overwriting the .exe file in the no disk crack? 

I had the same error. It turned out to be that 7-zip (my rar extractor) didn't have permission to overwrite program files in Windows 7 (may also apply to Vista). 

Run your extractor as an Administrator (there is a special option when right clicking on the program in Win7) and try again. Hope this helps. "
