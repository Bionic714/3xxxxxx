,h2whoa,2006-03-07T21:23Z,"The Serial Number is in the Crack folder. When I try to install though it eventually asks me to insert disk 2, which obviously I can't! How do I get round this?"
,h2whoa,2006-03-07T23:24Z,As far as I can tell this torrent is useless as installation won't complete because it asks you to insert disc 2
,rtucker069,2006-03-08T01:46Z,"you mount both of the cds at the same time.  i use power iso and sety the number of drives to four (allows four mounting slots).  once you have mounted both, click on the ""run game"" icon in the directory of CD1.  the game should run and do a full install. in the case it doesnt do a full install: simply unmount and then remount CD2 ONLY! and then you might want to try openeing and closing one of your cd drives.  then click ok.  if it doesnt work keep trying.  it eventually will!"
,jburna,2006-03-14T02:26Z,"can someone help please!  i have winrar, i downloaded this and i cant get it to work cuz i dont know what im doing. any suggestions?"
,Tools2basic,2006-03-17T19:39Z,Seed more please! :D 
,Tools2basic,2006-03-18T08:50Z,".::Easy Setup::.
1. You need Deamon Tools
2. Mount Sim City A
3. The serial is in there in ""crack""
4.When it asks for Cd2, Mount Sim City B
5.Later it will ask for game disk, mount Sim city A

That shoud be it.."
,Tools2basic,2006-03-18T08:58Z,".::Follow up::.
I forgot to ad one thing..
when you have installd the game you shoud extract the crack from Sim City A(im not sure if it maters if its Simcity A or Simcity B)

But when this is done your ready to play

Thx for seeding guys :)"
,micleg,2006-03-18T13:55Z,"This is not the updated version of the game so you need to make an online update if you want the ""latest"" wealth of bug fixes and new additions. The cracked exe seems to work anyway (strange!). I think I'll just try to buy the original SC4 since I own Rush Hour. "

,wingrider9,2006-09-15T19:02Z,"I copied the ISO images to cd's and installed everything but when trying to play it says ""cannot find game data"".  Is anyone else still having this problem?? I don't know what to do next. Please help!"
,wingrider9,2006-09-15T21:49Z,"OK GOT IT WORKING!!! Here You Go to fellow newbies...

I had both these problems... If you have a ""Cannot Find Game Data"" or even that
 ""insert ~ play disc"" problem then you need to first:

Copy the cracked content located in the \Crack directory to your installation directory where you installed the game for instance /program files/maxis/simcity 4 deluxe/ 
( the simcity 4 exe file).

Try to run the game... 
it will probably say ""insert ~ play disc""... 

Then at the same time after that comes up run PowerISO (that's available to download from this site) 
(I see some people have 4 drives selected but I only have 1 drive selected and it works) and click ""Mount"" and select (""SimCity 4 Deluxe A_ISO"") wherever you downloaded the file: .

And THEN click OK to restart the game(while PowerISO is still running right after you mounted ""SimCity 4 Deluxe A_ISO""...

and then the Play screen will come up and you can close PowerISO and any other programs... and then click PLAY ...

and it should work!!!  It did for Me!!

Let me know if I helped anybody here!

Also don't forget to check for updates"

If anyone was having the same problem as me with it being stuck in portuguese, just don't overwrite the SimCityLocale in the English folder.

Stupid mistake :P"

,coat-hanger-abortion,2007-09-05T02:40Z,"I only have the two iso files and the language file.  I'm guessing thats why this isn't working, (asking for a cd, and yes both files are mounted with daemon tools), should I just re-download it ?  I'm still going to seed for a little bit longer. "
,coat-hanger-abortion,2007-09-05T02:42Z,"sorry to post twice but...

Just tried to redownload and there isn't a crack in this file.  IS everyone downloading a different crack on here, if so could someone post a link, I'd really appreciate it, I'm going to look around on here for one, but there are so many virus'"
,coat-hanger-abortion,2007-09-05T02:56Z,"...oh my god, i am SO stupid. *just realized I had to extract from either A or B*  If no one minds me asking ANOTHER stupid question, do I have to extract both or just the one?"

,ManMadeSpoon,2007-12-16T18:27Z,"fuck.
fully installed it, and i mounted disk 1 with Daemon Tools and went to autoplay and it loads and says to insert disk one. i've tried it like 10 times and i've ejected and everything. can anyone help figure out what's going on?"
,wildcat.nl,2008-03-20T20:56Z,"lol ManMadeSpoon, you have to download a crack, search for it on gamecopyworld.com search for something like fixed exe/no cd or anything, download it, extract it with winrar and then replace your new exe with the original exe in your simcity folder... good luck! "
