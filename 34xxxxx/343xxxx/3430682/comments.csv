,olson,2006-01-31T15:12Z,Found the original so cheap I'll buy it instead.
,lightnin,2006-01-31T21:55Z,"Downloading since day 1 and everyones at 83%...hopefully we'll get 100% before easter ;)

Note: This is not a complaint, rather an encouragment so close to the finishing line."
,DjMosse,2006-02-03T13:26Z,"This should contain everything, course I ripped whole DVD with out anykind shrinking or other things....."
[V],mjeith,2006-02-08T01:18Z,Anyone seeding?
,DjMosse,2006-02-08T21:02Z,Yes... I'm...
,DjMosse,2006-02-13T20:37Z,"Now ==> Error (Torrent unauthorised)
How that is possible, anyone knows?"
,DjMosse,2006-02-18T03:43Z,"Well... In Linux, we don't have many clients!

howsabout trying some other software for seeding?"
,lightnin,2006-02-18T17:17Z,"too bad. well, im gonna hang on for a while i case you solve it. if not, im not gonna sue you."
,asereje,2006-02-28T19:16Z,"What's means 97'6%?

Seed someone, pleaze."
,asereje,2006-03-07T23:11Z,"This is a fuck torrent. This iso is a corrupt iso. Any program read this. I burn a RICOH DL and any DVD read this format.

Please, DJMosse, DON'T MAKE ANYMORE ISO TORRENT, YOU DON'T KNOW MAKE IT SO OK."
,DjMosse,2006-03-09T23:00Z,"Well, maybe U calculate MD5 from it and send that sum to me, and I calculate it too... That is only way we can be sure it's no corrupted...
And maybe U say how make .iso file right way!
:-D


DON'T MAKE ANYMORE ISO TORRENT, YOU DON'T KNOW MAKE IT SO OK."
,asereje,2006-03-14T01:42Z,"MagicISO and UltraISO give error to open file. Nero burn RICOH-DL but copy was wrong. Any DVD didn't read this copy.

Wrong ISO, DjMOsse. Sorry, believe it."
,DjMosse,2006-03-14T04:22Z,"Well... Md5sum says something else!
Original DVD and that .iso are same in binary level...
So, maybe U calculate that md5sum and that way we know is it broken really, course I can mount file and look it without error in here!
:-D"
,asereje,2006-03-15T20:31Z,"Of course, after all things I wrote, I deleted it and never dowload your link anymore."
,DjMosse,2006-03-15T20:59Z,"So U say dd if=/dev/cdrecorder of=$1.iso is wrong way to rip CD or DVD?
If so, you have to allso say it to O'Reillys writers too!
;-)
So, only way is that mine OR yours torrent client is making error while downloading....."
,asereje,2006-03-16T09:27Z,"OK. You win !!!

BitComet is a bad torrent client,I have a so bad ISP and I haven't kwoledge about ISO format. All is true for you, finally I say to the world. I am stupid.

Can you share this concert into a normal subfolder VIDEO_TS format, please so I can download again?

ThankX"
,DjMosse,2006-03-16T18:56Z,"Not stupid... Nobody knows everything!
And after this point, all releases I make, there is md5sum too, so ppls may check if there is problem!
And that VIDEO_TS is little problem, course then here is two ""same"" releases!
But I will think of it..."
