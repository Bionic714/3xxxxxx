,nit3,2008-08-11T09:48Z,just to clear this up you all. and the rest of the world. when you download xbox games. if its iso. try to open it with winrar. if you cant. burn it with nero to a cd. then your done. if its rar. you need to exract all the files. make sure default.xbe is in the main directory. then download a program like xiso and it makes a xbox iso. then burn that iso to a disk. and do all the idiots that say you need a modded xbox. you absolutely do not. your retarded. if you do it like i say. the right way. you dont. Not being cocky. I just dont like people who think they know stuff when they dont. happy gaming =]
