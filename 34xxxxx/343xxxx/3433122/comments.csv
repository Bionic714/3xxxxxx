,BBinky,2006-01-19T02:32Z,I've been waiting for this one for a long time - Thanks
,Poeten123,2006-01-19T09:30Z,Sweet. Now we're waiting for more old ESC. I'm also looking for old Melodifestivalen. Is it someone that has those recorded and can rip them?
,franky80y,2006-01-19T19:01Z,"Good question Poeten123, you beat me to it!  Hopefully there are people out there who can rip these pre-2000 ESCs and share them.  Hopefully this does set a trend with folk to do just that.  Ones I'm missing are from 1986-1989, a better quality version of the 1982 contest and I understand there was also a colour broadcast of the 1969 ESC.  MFs would always be great to share too.  This idea with sharing contests by means of torrent files was just an experiment but it has turned out to be more popular than I imagined.  Watch this space for another in the next few days.  :-)"
