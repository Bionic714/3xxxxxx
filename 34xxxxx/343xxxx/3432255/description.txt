Kenneth R. Miller, PhD, was the star science witness in the recent Dover ?Panda Trial? in Pennsylvania where Judge John E Jones found ?intelligent design? to be a religious view, not science. He is the author of a bestselling high school biology textbook that was subject to the Cobb County, GA disclaimer sticker that warned students that evolution was ?a theory, not a fact.? The stickers were removed by court order in 2005. Miller is also author of the bestseller Finding Darwin?s God.
