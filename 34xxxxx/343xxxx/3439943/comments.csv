,erfo1,2006-02-05T20:14Z,How do i unpack & burn these files?
,simen_90,2006-02-06T11:58Z,"i cant fucking install this fucking applicaion... When i open the ISO file and click setup, nothing happens. When i mount the ISO in daemon tools nothing happens... WTF am i supposed to do?"
,xaxxon,2006-02-06T21:18Z,"copy all the files to your hard drive and install from there, then copy the dll's from the Crack dir over the installed versions (or just read the Crack/info.txt file like I did)"
,xaxxon,2006-02-06T21:20Z,"I'm not sure, but I think this is the ""Try out"" version offered from their website with the libraries hacked so that it never times out.  Since the ""Try out"" version isn't crippleware, this should be the same as the full version -- just when it loads up it says ""tryout version"" or whatever.."

,erfo1,2006-02-07T20:30Z,"This is a trial version!!!
No title templates or possibillities to burn DVD & more.
No crack or keygen can upgrade this version to full."
,Sir Winston,2006-02-07T22:32Z,It would be nice if the cRaCk was available seperatly.
,Parga,2006-04-22T22:30Z,"WHAT A JOKE!!!!  The software is a former Try-Out and therefor gallery as well as capture function does not work. It does not accept plug-in such as Magic Bullet.
THIS IS JUST WASTE OF TIME DOWNLOADING THIS!!!"

,Rezowitch,2006-10-25T17:58Z,"In Premiere 2 Pro built-in Minetoka Dolby Digital encoder may encode ac3 tracks only for 3 times, u must purchase it separately.

Anyone can help with that?

thanx"
,DSMKilla,2007-05-18T13:52Z,"Adobe calls this the TRYOUT version, but thats because it's the FULL VERSION but when you download it from Adobe you can only try it out for 30 days. Thats where the CRACK comes in to play. I have tested it out myself and have edited plenty of videos with it. Haven't found any restrictions!"
,DBraun31,2007-05-31T03:12Z,Stuck at 97.4%!! i need some seeders plz. and is this the trial version or not? has anyone burned a dvd?
,juanalzate,2007-06-24T08:48Z,"Did you receive any help? shbash_the_awesome I have the same situation. I can't uninstall it, uninstallation keeps being 'interupted'."
