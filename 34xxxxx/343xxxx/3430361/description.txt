Tender ballads, urgent travel songs, infectious boogies--Canadian Hank Snow not only handled them all, but he handled them quite well and rode them all to the top of the country charts. His music was a logical extension of his idol Jimmie Rodgers's style, and Snow's letter-perfect, prudently effective vocal delivery and crisp, tasteful acoustic-guitar runs graced countless (actually, 36) top 10 country hits. This 20-song collection provides a nice introduction to his various styles and captures all of his best-known songs. His own compositions "I'm Movin' On" and "Rhumba Boogie" plus covers like "I've Been Everywhere" and "I Don't Hurt Anymore" were not only hugely dominant hits (Shania wasn't the first Canadian country phenom), but they remain cornerstones of country. --Marc Greilsamer
