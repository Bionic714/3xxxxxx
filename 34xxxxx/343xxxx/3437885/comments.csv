,bagofcrap24,2006-07-30T17:18Z,"This Torrent is fucking bullshit, sorry 4 the insult man but i spent ages dloading this, only to find it burns to disc alright but within the first half an hour, after the introduction where sin appears in zanarkand, tidus meets auron and follows him,

auron then says look and then a video of tidus looking up at sin is supposed to play but instead the video doesnt play and the game freezes but the music keeps playing, sorry 4 the complaint but this torrent is a big waste of time"

,bagofcrap24,2006-09-11T11:40Z,"i take back my insult at this torrent, the game and image is fine, it was just my method of booting the game that was floored, for all others that use a method such as cogswap or that swapmagic thing, make sure that the ps2 dvd u put in first is larger in size than the copy you replace it with, you will need an original game that is bigger than 4.28gb or else your game will crash at certain points."

,Nyxxie,2008-06-28T16:27Z,Do you have to burn it or can you just use daemon tools?
,avatargohan,2008-08-12T23:46Z,It would be burned cause its safer that way. and as well to burn it use a program such as nero and burn it as saved image it should do it.
,semiar2,2008-08-14T08:04Z,"It worked fine burning at 8x onto Verbatim DVD+R disks. I use swap magic 3.8 to boot it.

Thx again mow_neo =)
it's people like you that makes life easier for us pirates lol"
,rikkitonton,2009-05-11T18:19Z,"This ISO image works very well with pcsx2. My guess is that the other commentators on here don't really understand how to configure pcsx2 for their systems, or they're systems are weak. i have a core i7 920, 3 gigs ddr3 ram, gtx285 graphics, and this game plays perfectly. i used daemon tools to mount the image. thank you for seeding, this game is the best ever!!!!"
,rikkitonton,2009-05-17T00:51Z,DO NOT WASTE UR TIME. the game crashes at the djose temple just as your leaving. i even took the time to redownload the iso and it keeps crashing at the same point. i was using daemon tools and playing on pcsx2. i did however find a save file at codes.ign.com that is set just beyond the djose temple. so i didnt miss much. if your burning this and playing on a ps2 then i dont know if this applys to you. but good luck.

,Gogits,2009-07-19T03:50Z,"i can confirm what rikkitonton said.
the game stucks and eventually crushes after completing djose temple during a cut scene that also cant be skipped.

i do not recomend downloading."
,Sky1,2010-02-18T06:05Z,"You guys really don't know how to use PSCX2, either that or you are too lazy to google your answers.
1) You don't need to burn or mount the ISO. Config > Configure > Use ""Linuz Iso CDVD o.8.0"" as your Cdvdrom plugin. When you Run CD/DVD select the iso file on your hardrive and bob's your uncle.
2) The crashing issue is an issue with PCSX2 0.9.6 and possibly with other versions. This ROM IS FINE. To circumvent crashing at Djose's Temple (right after Yuna's Hair Combing scene) turn on the following speed hacks
-Use x3 cycle rate
-INTC Sync Hack
-Changing the rendering driver is also recommended
Make a new save file then revert to your old settings and you are good to go."

,gahaj123,2010-03-22T02:28Z,"Just to let people know what I did...
I'm Using fat ps2. I patched the iso with Y-fix (google it) and It messed up gameplay. What i had to do was use adr patcher, and then Y-fix (google). then i burned at max speed with imgburn, and loaded via cogswap with vice city. works perfectly, screen centered and everything, I played up too where you meet wakka and everything works SO far..."
,gahaj123,2010-03-22T02:30Z,"oh yeah sorry google ""sks apps"" and the two patchers i mentioned. I had freemcboot and all that as well, for added info...."
,jtundra,2010-06-11T17:56Z,For any random poster that checks this I could really use some help. I have the American version of this game and it freezes at the same spot as this one. I've been looking all over for a download of a save state/memory card file that is right after that point so I can continue. I have found 1 but I don't believe it works or I'm not loading it properly since Ive never had to fix a problem like this before lol. If any of you figure out a way around this problem please comment on here or feel free to email me at jtundra10@yahoo.com. I would seriously love you forever :P
,Kraden,2010-06-15T20:36Z,"When trying to start the game I get the message: ""CDVD plugin failed to open.  Your computer may have insufficient resources, or incompatible hardware/drivers.(thread:EE Core"" I do however find it hard to belive that my computer wouldnt be able to handle the game since I can play FFX-2 without any problem. Im using PCSX2 as my emulator and using ""Linuz Iso CDVD 0.9.0"" as my cdvd. I would really appriciate any help."

,nickmilev,2010-08-20T09:14Z,Guys I burned the image with ''ImgBurn'' at the lowest speed x1 and when I put it in my chipped ps2 it plays up to where the hero meets Auron and it crashes at the cutseen. 
,Quad-K,2010-08-20T11:50Z,"Works great with Pcsx2 0.9.6 if you get the settings right, mainly Cd software. 

Linuz Iso was the only CD software that worked for me. For graphics, ZeroGS gave me superior graphics, but ruined the cinematic scenes so they were completely unwatchable, so i used GSdx SSE3. Don't try mess with sound too much, although it could use some tuning. Works on Euro and  USA Bios.

as mentioned earlier, to get past the Temple where it freezes on Yuna, use the following:

-x3 cycle rate
-INTC Sync Hack
-Changing the rendering driver is also recommended

Also worked in Matrix Modded Ps2.

Thanks mow_neo!! I'll seed to at least 2.000"

,Quad-K,2010-08-20T11:58Z,"WORKS with Pcsx2 0.9.6

CD:         Linuz Iso
Graphics: GSdx (ZeroGS causes cinematic errors)

Those are the only mandatory changes, besides the sound needing some minor tuning. Works with USA and Euro Bios.

You may freeze at the Djose temple when in a cut scene. If so., follow the instructions previously posted:

-Use x3 cycle rate
-INTC Sync Hack
-Changing the rendering driver is also recommended

Save it, then revert to your old settings =]

Works with matrix Modded PS2.

,Livy.the.pixie,2011-03-16T11:09Z,"Do not recommended this torrent for playing on PlayStation 2. PAL version of Final Fantasy X is a bad conversion from the NTSC counterpart. It has two annoying black bars at the top and bottom of the screen. The image is stretched which makes all characters look short and fat. If you play this game on PCSX2, everything is normal -- there's no black border -- but personally, I feel the gameplay slower than the original NTSC version. I recommend the original NTSC-U version instead. If you like the extra contents (dark aeon, Penance...) so go with the International version. It is in English except for the starting menu (you can change it to English later).

Source: PS2 owner. I've tried both version, including this torrent. Read the article at [http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/r_ffx_ps2] for more references."
,TheOnlyBlade,2011-04-14T10:02Z,"This was supposed to be made for the PS2 yet a majority of it doesn't work and it's buggy. Therefore use and emulator. If your disc says ""Wrong Format"" on the PS2 then clearly you burned it onto the wrong disc or your Ps2 isn't chipped/cracked.

Overall didn't get 1 crash and worked fine. Thanks for the torrent, also please seed. 4 seeds isn't enough for anyone. Thanks :)"
