BLAKE'S NEW JERUSALEM 1978

Tim Blake is one of the, often overlooked, early masters of New Age 
Synthesiser music.  His early accomplishments mark him out as a 
great innovator in his field and puts him up with the likes of Jean 
Michelle Jarre.  In his career he has worked with bands such as Gong, 
Hawkwind and Steve Hillage and there are aspects of all of these in his 
solo work.

I first heard 'New Jerusalem' way back, in 1978/9, when it was first 
released on vinyl, and I was delighted to find that a re-release on CD, 
in 1992, was still available.  Although short by modern standards, with 
five tracks playing for just under 40 minutes, this is a very 
atmospheric piece that is worthy of closer attention.

The first track, 'Song for a New Age', opens with acoustic guitar work 
which continues throughout, playing to a backdrop of moog sounds 
with vocals provided by Tim Blake.  This is followed by an excellent 
rendition of 'Lighthouse', written by Blake but known to many as a 
Hawkwind song - I have heard many versions of this particular track, 
but this has got to be my all time favourite.  The use of synthesisers 
and vocal effects at the beginning of the track really places it in the 
outer space setting. 

Next comes 'Generator (Laserbeam)' which is a much weaker track, 
the vocals have a very nasal quality which detract from its appeal 
when compared to the rest of the album, however at 3:34 (the 
shortest track on the album) it's livable with!  'Passage Sur La Cite De 
La Revelation' is the fourth track, this is a purely instrumental piece 
and is superbly effective.

Finally, we come to the title track of the album 'Blake's New 
Jerusalem', based on (and in fact using lines from) the poem 
'Jerusalem' by William Blake!  The introduction to this track is 
beautifully evocative, starting quietly with a repeating pattern than just 
builds up and up - it's very hypnotic, seeming to flow over you and 
carry you along like a river; sometimes fast, sometimes swirling slowly 
around, but always with an insistent driving energy pushing it forwards 
and keeping it moving.  The vocal content is kept to a minimum, thus 
enhancing the overall mood rather than intruding upon it.  This is a 
real masterpiece and turned out to be every bit as good as I 
remembered it from all that time ago! 

Over twenty years on, from its original conception, this album is, 
perhaps, something of a cliché.  Certainly, it could be tagged 'hippy' 
music by those who don't trouble to take the work in context.  
However, the fact remains that if you like this kind of music, or if you 
don't, it paved the way for much that came later in the rock and 
progressive world and, as such, I can recommend it as an addition to 
the collection of any serious keyboard lovers.
