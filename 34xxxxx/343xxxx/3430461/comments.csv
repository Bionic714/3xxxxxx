,junknstuff,2006-01-27T09:18Z,"dude, this is a kick ass program!! I got 5000+ files recovered!! yea!! this is legit"
,rimbim,2006-02-03T22:14Z,"No viruses or anything, but note the small size.
It hasn't got the file recovery or disk checking facilities in it!
go for the other BIG file d/loads (which I am currently using)."
,mungo75,2006-02-19T03:53Z,"Nothing wrong with this program it works fine.
 Maybe you should look at some of the other data recovery programs, they are much smaller. The only reason some are so big is because they include things like Acrobat reader and MS NET 1.1 installers ect."
,Chandro,2007-05-22T06:00Z,"mmm, when i select recovery data, the program closes, anyone knows why?

,TheAmishNazi,2009-04-01T02:15Z,"If Easy Recovery quits after selecting one of the recovery options try reading the following answer from the Ontrack FAQ:

Question
Why did EasyRecovery quit running on my system?

Answer
If EasyRecovery shuts down unexpectedly, it could be caused by a hardware defect or a hardware or software conflict. In the few times we have seen this, it was caused by either a conflict with antivirus software or by trying to scan a drive that has physical hardware defects.

Sometimes antivirus software can load components that are not visible in Windows, so if EasyRecovery abends (shuts down unexpectedly) while scanning a drive, please try booting into Windows Safe Mode and run EasyRecovery from there. If that does not solve the problem, then it is likely the drive is defective and would require our in-lab recovery service.

If EasyRecovery shuts down unexpectedly right after you choose one of the recovery options (AdvancedRecovery, StandardRecovery, DeletedRecovery, FormatRecovery or RawRecovery) or right after it says ?Please Wait, Scanning System?, it is most likely you have a hard drive controller that contains RAID hardware capability. The only solution would be to move the mirror or mirrored drive you wish to recover from (assuming it is not striped or spanned) to a computer which does not have a RAID-capable controller and run the EasyRecovery data recovery module there.

FileRepair modules or EmailRepair modules should not have this difficulty.
