If you like the Blues and Robert Johnson, follow John Hammond as he (John) retraces Robert Johnsons' footsteps into a journey that finds some of Roberts old friends, girlfriends, and old footage. John travels to court houses and one of Robert Johnsons girl friends gets to hear a Recording of Robert Johnson for the first time!! John also finds a possible son and grandson of Robert Johnson.

I give this Recording about a B plus. I recorded this several years ago on to V.H.S. and used the Standard Video Recording of the time and kept this Video put up and forgot that I had it. I transfered it on a new home unit D.V.D. recorder that I am trying to learn how to use!!

In the past I have uploaded some Roy Buchanan and Rory Gallagher but I thought I would give this Historical piece a shot! There are no Commercials in this and I recorded it off of a Sattelite. Thanks, Rick from Roy Buchanans HUB
