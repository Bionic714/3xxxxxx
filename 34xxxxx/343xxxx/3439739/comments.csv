Wesley Snipes acts as good as a crash-test-dummie and the story and screenplay looks like a bad schoolproject video.. The title ""7 seconds"" is taken from a bombtimer in the movie and makes no sense at all (as the rest of the movie..). This movie is only for people that would take a bullet for mr Snipes.."
