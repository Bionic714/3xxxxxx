All the police from around the world are after Anthony Zimmer, a criminal genius operating in the financial sphere. No one knows what he looks like, but among the competitors in the chase to nab him, Akerman, an exceptional cop, is one lap ahead: he knows that Zimmer will risk anything to see Chiara again.
The young woman was supposed to link up with the elusive criminal, but instead receives a message from him. To shake off the people on his tail, Zimmer asks Chiara to accost a stranger and to make everyone believe he?s the man they?re all after. Chiara sets her cap at François, an ordinary man who, fascinated by the young woman, rapidly finds himself caught up in a nightmare.
In a world full of manipulations and pretense, they all discover that, despite appearances, they?re merely pieces in a chess game being played while waiting for the grand master to arrive.
