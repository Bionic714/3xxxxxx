Amin Bhatia Reviews
From: "Mark Fonda" <> Date: Thu Oct 30, 2003 10:38 pm Subject: 
Interstellar Suite Reissue 
Dear Interstellar Suite Friend, Just when you thought all hope in the 
galaxy was lost... Amin Bhatia's acclaimed recording "The Interstellar 
Suite" has been digitally remastered from its original analog elements 
and is currently at the pressing plant. You will be able to order your 
CD through an exclusive web retailer to be identified on launch day, 
Tuesday November the 4th. Please visit www.interstellarsuite.com to 
get the official launch schedule for your universe. Yes, finally. No, we 
can't believe it either. Thank you so much for your patience and 
encouragement. This "interstellar" battle has taken years and would 
not have been possible without you. As further thanks, the first 500 
people who quote the phrase "Distress Signal" upon ordering, will 
receive 1 of only 500 CDs personally signed and numbered by the 
composer, Amin Bhatia. Best wishes, The crew at www.
interstellarsuite.com 

Years ago, as electronic music was strengthening its position in the 
mainstream and the radio was starting to play what became known as 
"New Age Music", there emerged a new label called Cinema, which 
was a new imprint from Capitol Records. The Cinema artists were 
mostly renowned keyboard artists from well-known bands, such as 
Peter Bardens (Camel), Patrick Moraz, Tony Kaye (both from Yes) 
and Michael Hoenig. And then there was Amin Bhatia, whose release 
has far outlived the others, and, in fact, most titles from that era, 
circa 1987. 

Unfortunately, the label folded soon after its launch, and these CDs 
have been unavailable since. Due to a total committemnt to quality 
and enduring music, Amin has never let up in his desire to make this 
CD available again. It just took a while!! Now, BACKROADS Music is 
pleased to be the Source for this classic CD that was so far ahead of 
its time that even now it is groundbreaking, and it sounds more 
sensational than ever thanks to the process in which the CD has been 
digitally remastered from its original analog elements... 

"...Bhatia has composed a whole orchestral suite as a soundtrack for 
an imaginary wide-screen science fiction movie and then produced it 
on synthesizers. The debt to composers like John Williams is evident, 
but Bhatia manages to avoid bombast and electronic clich?, leaning 
instead on string timbres and Minimoog brass. Fragments of imaginary 
dialog also pop up here and there, adding to the sense of drama. 
Definitely a winner." -JA, Keyboard Magazine Mar 1988.

"...Amin Bhatia's The Interstellar Suite is on a new Capital subsidiary 
called Cinema.. Though this full synthesized suite is not from any 
soundtrack, some enterprising movie-maker could almost make a sci-fi 
picture based on its music. Guideposts are offered via track titles such 
as "The Ship", "Launch", "Distress Signal", "Rescue Fleet", & "Battle". 
This is superb, imaginative and inventive music." -Jan 89 "...I'd give 
this all-instrumental album an 88/100 & I'd change that to about a 94
/100, if I were a fan of Star Trek music. Alas, the main setback of 
this album is that it is SO hard to come by." -David Barrio, Gibraltar 
Encyclopedia of Progressive Rock Feb 97.
