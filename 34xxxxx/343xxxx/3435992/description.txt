This contains both the French and English audio. Along with English, Spanish and Portuguese subtitles.
(The English subs are fully corrected and timed. Spanish and Portuguese maybe slightly out in places.)

the audio has been cleaned up and the db levels of each stream matched as best as I could manage.

I believe this to be the most complete version of La JetÃ©e available anywhere.

Enjoy!
