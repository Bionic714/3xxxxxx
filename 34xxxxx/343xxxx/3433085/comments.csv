,johnnyrico,2006-01-24T21:33Z,This description is misleading. Ape Escape 3 and Ape Academy are two dirrerent games on different consoles! Ape Academy is only on the PSP. Ape Escape 3 is on the PS2.

,Testman,2006-03-03T07:51Z,"Does anybody have the Full DVD version of Ape Escape 2, USA?

The one uploaded by callmebob is a cd rip, not a full dvd. The other version of Ape Escape 2 on Piratebay is a full dvd, but it is a European PAL version.

Could anybody possibly upload the full dvd version of this great gem of a game? Please help if possible. Thanks!"
