,digby5,2006-01-30T00:24Z,"weirdest shit ever..
the same characters one moment are speaking english and later on they're speaking italian. and in both cases the dubbing is rather bad - typical of 70s flicks. i still am not sure which is the original language - imdb says italian but the italian and the characters' mouths don't match..  argento movies & bad soundtracks seem to go hand and hand apparently."

The reason for this is because this is the director's cut. It was never translated into English so the parts that arn't original to the initial US release are still in Italian. "
