,KOREA Nuclear,2006-01-29T18:36Z,I would love to get that jeff mills soundtrack. Like his sets.
,junatik,2006-01-29T18:45Z,unfortunately the fritz lang society never gave mills permission to show it at his gigs nor release it on dvd. luckily i got to see it at a private screening by mills in nyc in '99..
