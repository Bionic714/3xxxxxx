PART1

right!

First of all, big thanks for the upload! Very good music! Some tracks are just great!

But then I found a little bug in the first compilation (  VA_-_La_Noche_Escabrosa_House_Compilation-3CD-2005-iDC)

To be precise in its CUE files. They contaon following strings at the beginning:"
,dimetrius,2006-02-12T17:43Z,"PART2

FILE ""VA - La Noche Escabrosa Mixed By Luca Agnelli CD1.wav"" WAVE

FILE ""VA - La Noche Escabrosa Mixed By Mauro Ferrucci CD2.wav"" WAVE

FILE ""VA - La Noche Escabrosa Mixed By Paolo Martini CD3.wav"" WAVE"
,dimetrius,2006-02-12T17:44Z,"PART3

They have to be changed to:

FILE ""101_va_-_la_noche_escabrosa_mixed_by_luca_agnelli_cd1-idc.mp3"" MP3

FILE ""201_va_-_la_noche_escabrosa_mixed_by_mauro_ferrucci_cd2-idc.mp3"" MP3

FILE ""301_va_-_la_noche_escabrosa_mixed_by_paolo_martini_cd3-idc.mp3"" MP3

respectively in order to split the tracks."
,dimetrius,2006-02-12T17:46Z,"PART4 - FINAL

If you don't know how to split them like I didn't some time ago then do Google for CUE Splitter. Great program!

And enjoy listening! Keep seeding! Take care!

,bombardemang,2006-02-20T22:55Z,"hehe, thx but I did knew how to split them but I've never felt the need for it though I use foobar2000 with .cue support. And then I don't really understood the part about .wav extensions but I've atleast not had any problems playing any of the files. Plus I got that specific release from tpb :-)

Thanks for the comments! Always appriciated."
