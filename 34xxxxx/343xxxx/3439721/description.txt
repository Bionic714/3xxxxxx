Le Orme - "Elementi"(2001)

Though the tracks are short, they flow together as one long suite.  It is perhaps a little more up tempo than Il Fiume and most of that CD?s occasional new age tendencies are gone.  Compositionally speaking, this is a very successful album.  These guys really know how to open up and let rip with a symphonic keyboard driven theme and then mellow out with reflective haunting variation.  Those sampled mellotron choirs are appreciated as well!  Aldo Tagliapietra?s voice is as warm and sincere as ever and he even plays some sitar here and there.  This is one of those albums that you put on and listen to all the way through; no single track stands out as each piece depends on what came before.
