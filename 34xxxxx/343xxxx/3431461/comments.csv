,fisheyebullshit,2006-03-23T08:37Z,"I'm sorry for me outburst... I just heard GWB speaking before I wrote that (what a piece ... he could never understand this movie in his life). Anyway, thanx X-Raider. I hope I get it. "
,fisheyebullshit,2006-03-23T09:05Z,Now seeder gone at 99.9% hmmm. Maybe some fool thinks GWB is for real. How can you ditch someone at 99.9%? Poor fool
,fisheyebullshit,2006-03-23T09:25Z,99.98% And the seeder is gone. If this does not come down I'm down with this site. And I have a huge upload rate. 
,fisheyebullshit,2006-03-24T09:48Z,"Yeah, I got it. I'll seed for several days. This movie is so fucking precient to the times. Everyone in Us (anyway, bccause it is so US) should see this movie. Think Iraq bitch"
,rasper121,2006-03-26T21:16Z,Can someone seed please?

,X-Raider,2006-11-03T23:56Z,I'm happy to see that this torrent is still running. Enjoy! ;-)
,Artak,2006-12-13T22:05Z,NO Finnish SUBS on this one..
,sanjuro_61,2007-03-24T23:24Z,"Please, SEEDS!"
,sanjuro_61,2007-07-15T21:39Z,Info says there's 1 seeder... wish it were true :(
,sanjuro_61,2007-07-30T23:25Z,"Info still saying there's 1 seed! 
WE are al stuck at 69.6 % since 323 B.C. !!!

Please, seeds!"
,sanjuro_61,2007-12-04T00:17Z,"Please, seeder, come back! 
We're still here."
,sanjuro_61,2008-01-25T21:29Z,"Seeds please! 
This edition (Warner Bros.) is the best"
,barton101,2012-07-22T06:50Z,"Next time, please include English subtitles for the hearing impaired. They are also good for people who don't have English as their first language. Subtitles take up hardly any extra space. They also make for more seeders because the torrent is useful to more people."
