,CYBER101,2006-02-02T14:14Z,"Don't mind the '0 seeders' stuff: I'm here alright!
And it's flowing to all the right people!"
,Mullebulle,2006-02-02T14:57Z,Why not share the original release? RAR for the win!
,suckittrebek,2006-02-02T18:15Z,"something is fucked up here, if you look at the size of the files in the release compared to the release size, the files only add up to 2.1 GB or so but yet it says its 4.38 GB"
,CYBER101,2006-02-02T18:28Z,"I'm uploading an IMG of 4.37 GB to be precise:
4.588.774 kb [which will add up to a burn of 4.698.904.576 bytes, don't worry it's all there!
Test burned it myself to assure there won't be any coasters"
,zipo24,2006-02-02T21:20Z,Thanks for the movie.

,majorwoodey,2006-02-04T21:57Z,"Ok, been downloading for 2 days now, and I'm only at 75.5 percent, and all of a sudden the tracker dropped like 300 leachers. I hope that you guys didn't download and run like most noobs do. Please help seed this when you finish."
,CYBER101,2006-02-05T12:58Z,"MWoodey, 040206 was site down last night. That might explain a bit. People could not connect to the tracker anymore.
Is now alright again I suppose if you read this, otherwise, Catch-22."
,Shenemanz,2006-02-05T19:31Z,"Hey

How Do You Burn The Img File To A DVD?"
,majorwoodey,2006-02-05T19:54Z,"Good question, I tried with nero and alcohol 120 and both burned coasters due to the file not being recognized."
,CYBER101,2006-02-05T23:38Z,"Shenemanz & Mwoodey:
Just burned it again to DVDr: Perfect screen and working menu. I used the latest version of Nero 7. If you have any  problems with Image or Iso formats try dvd-shrink or dvd decrypter to unpack it to the Video_TS file and burn that.
Or you can also use MagicIso, try this 1 from Hornetsuk: http://thepiratebay.org/details.php?id=3267446."
,dingel104,2006-02-05T23:47Z,hi. Is there a way to make a dvd-movie from a DivX-XviD file AND get about 4.38 GiB out?? I always end up with about 3.92 GiB... Thhxx
,Shenemanz,2006-02-06T04:29Z,"How Do I Use MagicISO To Make The Dvd Movie

Playable On A DVD Player."
,dingel104,2006-02-06T08:54Z,Shenemanz: open magicIso find the Iso-file and it will give you 2 folders - Audio_TS and Video_ts. Click Video_TS and all files will popup- select all files and extract them to a DVD-folder and after that you burn the files with ect. Nero or what U use... 
,Shenemanz,2006-02-06T13:56Z,"Not it is downloaded as a .img

Also how do i convert the .img to Iso?"
,suckittrebek,2006-02-06T23:40Z,"no need to convert anything, just go to recorder => burn image in nero, select all file types and choose .img file, leave all default settings alone, burn at whatever speed you want, 4 X is best imo, finalize and click burn."
,emiO,2006-02-09T15:56Z,how do i downnloade ?? plzz tel me
,jinkssick,2006-02-10T15:20Z,Use dvd decrypter to burn the image. has never let me down.
,henriktt,2006-02-11T20:02Z,Did you rip out the extras? because the quality of the movie is much more important than the extras
