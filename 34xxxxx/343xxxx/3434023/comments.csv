,smith-law,2009-07-12T16:44Z,"I downloaded this set off Mininova back in December, I was a big sceptic about hypnotherapy not anymore.. on the first listen I quit smoking not touched one in 7 months and believe me I was a heavy smoker I was one of those people who would flip out if I had to wait too long for a 'fix'. I've tried quitting before using patches and nasal spray but I went back to smoking but this cd set really worked. Cd 3 is the one that does the magic.
It says to listen to it for 2 weeks but you can use it for longer as it is so relaxing that you'll fall asleep whilst listening and wake feeling relaxed.
I used to think Paul McKenna was a fake but now I think he's God like.. it's so great being smoke free.
Smokers give it a go, seriously I doubted it would work as I didn't even want to quit.. but it worked "
