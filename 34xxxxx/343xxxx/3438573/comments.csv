,smguy,2010-05-09T22:40Z,"Could not get this torrent to work. Unpacked the .rar file, but there was just a .diz, three .zips (which didn't help when I unpacked them), a file named H20 that windows couldn't open, and a .rar that couldn't be unpacked because it was corrupted. Anyone else have this problem? Am I doing something wrong?"
,lycanized,2012-05-17T09:42Z,"Smguy and anyone else who has that problem, I had a problem with that too. Just don't undo the zipped files separately but highlight them all and unpack that way, then go into that file and use the rar, otherwise you will get error messages when trying to rar"
