Good quality and good subtitles.

,noxul,2008-04-05T16:30Z,Whats hardcoded subs?
,s3x.m4ch1n3,2008-04-14T04:26Z,"I guess that's where the subtitles are 'burned' into the movie and impossible to turn off, if u get my meaning."
,juckum,2008-04-24T01:05Z,"seeds plxses u seeders seed? me need seed... here's a poem about seeding:

seeding is sharing,
seeding is caring,
seeding is fun,
seeding gives cum!

the last line prob isnt fitting for this upload, but who cares, eh?!"
,shut.down,2008-05-27T00:35Z,"great movie, please seed.

thanks in advance!"
,pekerhed,2009-03-21T03:45Z,"I prefer the hard-coded.  They're good for the stand-alone dvd/divx players.  
So all you panzies who are complaining, if you don't like the hard-coded subs, download a different torrent.   Dumb asses."
,enritnt,2009-06-17T18:37Z,"if you know german OR english theres no problem whit the harcoded subs in this one, but remember TPB is an international comunnity so youll get people from all non english speaking countries that cant use this rip cause they cant put theyr own language subs in it, this is not criticism to the uploader that take his time and effort to put this here is for the assholes that dont understand whi other assholes get mad at hardcoded subs (they are all asholes, this is FREE if you dont like it do it yourself)"
,Jack_Raiden,2009-10-24T11:40Z,"Thanks trickykungfu, seeders & MONGODLX!
