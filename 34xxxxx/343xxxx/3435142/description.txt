A Control For Cancer

A lecture by Dr. Ernst T. Krebs, Jr. 

The discoverer of Laetrile presents a biochemist's view of the origin of 
cancer and how nature attempts to control it with a substance called 
amygdalin. When it is purified and concentrated for cancer therapy, it is 
called Laetrile. A classic. 60-min. audio.

I ripped this from a tape over line-in and normalized the two sides of the
tape.  I then increased the volume of the questions at the end and broke
the speech up into logical sections.  There are a few minor hiccups and
pops, but I think it came across very clean.

G. Edward Griffin is planning to release his audio archives in CD format,
and he now allows copying of his audio.  When they get released to CD I 
suggest buying them, or in some way supporting him and others like him in
getting pertinent information out to the people.
