Written and Narrated by G. Edward Griffin.

This is a video adaptation of a documentary filmstrip which explains the 
scientific rationale for Laetrile therapy. It presents evidence that cancer, 
like scurvy or pellagra, is a deficiency disease. It is not caused by the 
presence of some mysterious virus or X- factor, but by the lack of an 
essential food factor which, increasingly, is deleted from the menus of 
modern man. The native diets of those cultures where cancer is rare is 
examined and found to be 200 times more rich in this substance than the diet 
of industrialized society. The missing food factor is called amygdalin or 
vitamin B17, but in its concentrated and purified form developed specifically 
for cancer therapy, it is known as Laetrile. A theoretical model for the 
biological action of Laetrile is presented. Included are dramatic case 
histories of terminal cancer patients who have recovered using Laetrile 
therapy. Based upon the book of the same name.
