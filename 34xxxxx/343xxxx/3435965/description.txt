              Michael Palmer - The Patient (Unabridged Audiobook)
*******************************************************************************
The Patient, Michael Palmer's ninth medical suspense novel, is a fast-paced
beat-the-clock thriller. Someone is killing off the world's most gifted
neurosurgeons, and Alex Bishop, a renegade CIA agent, thinks he knows who it is.
Bishop is out to settle his score with Claude Malloche, an international
assassin responsible for the death of Bishop's brother. When he learns that
Malloche is afflicted with an inoperable brain tumor, Bishop understands why the
murdered neurosurgeons died, and where Malloche will strike next. Meanwhile,
Jessie Copeland, an MIT-trained mechanical engineer and neurosurgeon, is working
to perfect a robotic device that will revolutionize brain surgery.  One of the
patients awaiting surgery at Boston's Eastern Massachusetts Medical Center is 
Malloche--but which one? No one has ever been able to identify the assassin, and
Jessie is hardly well known enough to attract his notice. But ARTIE, the robotic
device, is--and Malloche will stop at nothing to ensure that it's used to save
his own life. He threatens to release a deadly nerve toxin on thousands of
innocent people, and Jessie is forced to save him at the cost of her own safety.
Notable for his swift pacing, well-drawn minor as well as major characters, and
medicalexpertise, Palmer delivers the goods with this heart-stopping read.
