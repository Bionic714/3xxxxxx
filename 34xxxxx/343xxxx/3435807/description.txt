              John Sandford - Mind Prey (Unabridged Audiobook)
*******************************************************************************
Minneapolis PD Deputy Chief Lucas Davenport, seen last in Night Prey, carries on 
as a smart, quirky hero in the seventh "Prey" book. When psychiatrist Andi Manette
and her two young daughters are kidnapped, Lucas must discover whether it's a 
ransom snatch, the work of oneof Andi's ex-patients or the ruse of someone in her
life who might benefit from her death. (Her father, stepmother, estranged husband 
and medical partner are all good suspects.) Readers know the kidnapper is John
Mail, a scary ex-patient who's entertained nasty dreams of Andi for years. He
enacts his violent sex fantasies with the imprisoned Andi; it seems only a matter
of time before he will go after the girls. Lucas, meanwhile, draws on all
available resources, including his own computer game company, to flush out Mail,
a gamer who enjoys taunting Lucas with phone calls. During this time, Andi has
been trying to maintain an element of control and contrive an escape. Sandford
expertly ratchets up the suspense from beginning to the brutal finish. Lucas does
get his villain, but no one comes out of this experience unscarred.
