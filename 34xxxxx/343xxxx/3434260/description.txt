Plot outline:
A young Tennessee lawyer fresh out of college takes the case of his life in this amazing courtroom drama. When a big insurance company tries to keep from having to pay for the care that a young man diagnosed with leukemia needs, the family decides to hire a lawyer. Rudy (Damon) takes on this client in his first case after the head of his law office has to hide because he's wanted by the feds. He must overcome many obstacles inside and outside the courtroom as he attempts to find out what it means to be a lawyer and how far you have to go before you become a sell-out.
