,ZtarQ142,2006-01-16T23:26Z,"Change the first file: alliance-the.fog-xvid.001
To: alliance-the.fog-xvid.r01 and start unzip it"
,190,2006-01-22T17:50Z,"It doesn´t work even if I change the filename.
Winrar ask´s for the next file .r02. Should I change all the file names to .r02 .r03 ec?"
,190,2006-01-22T22:33Z,"Oh man, that´s gonna take for ever, but I have already downloaded it so I´d better get started ;)"
,190,2006-01-23T18:53Z,"Shit, it didn´t work even when I changed all the filenames. Winrar unzipp´s the files but every 5 minutes I get somekind of error code or something, it´s the German version of winrar. Don´t understand German that well."

,sadoues,2006-05-13T09:48Z,I cant get the movie to work.. Just black on the screen .. :S Or some kind of a red skin.. 
,wally_91,2006-05-23T22:33Z,"You can just play the rar files in VLC. I have an other film that's in .rar format and it didn't work when I tried to unzip them but in worked in VLC.

It's no good anyway if you just want the videofiles. He should have made the torrent in some sort of movieformat. I mean the files :P;)"
,wally_91,2006-05-25T14:31Z,wait. it didn't work either. who is this masseur that puts this shit on the net? cant u just upload them in .mpeg or .avi format?
,otrixx,2006-05-26T11:29Z,"Im not at newbie, but not a pro either. I got the files to unzip. Just download Winrar (maybe you need the newest version). Click on the file alliance-the.fog-xvid and open it with Winrar. This works. If not, something is wrong with your winrar."
