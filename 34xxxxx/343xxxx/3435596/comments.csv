,adamreizz,2007-06-13T03:02Z,"If you already at 99%, u have dl the full movie. Just extract it and burn. enjoy the movie !!

The par & par2 is for parity check for error correction to the rar files (whether you already have all the complete files) . I've check it and everything in the rar files are all ok. u can use the Quickpar software to check. 

Open the quickpar and click the open button, use this file ""Transformers_Zone_English_Sub_Repack.par2"" to check the the PAR status. it will shown as completed from 01 to 77. 

Enjoy the great movie"
