Super Mario World was based off the popular video game of the same name and continued the Super Mario cartoon series. With Mario, Luigi and Princess Toadstool on Dinosaur Island and Yoshi replacing Toad and with them foiling the plans of King Koopa and his Koopa kids. This cartoon aired side-by-side with Season 3 of Captain N: The Game Master. See that guide for the shared Captain N cast list and episodes. Super Mario World was produced by DIC.


At first the Koopalings did not have real names because at the the time when the company was making the cartoon they did not know what their names would be, so they made up names for each of the Koopa kids. So the Koopa kids not having their real names in this cartoon is not a mistake or goof. 

Here are their real and cartoon names: 

Wendy = Kootie Pie 
Larry = Cheatsy 
Ludwig = Kooky 
Morton = Big Mouth 
Roy = Bully 
Lemmy = Hip 
Iggy = Hop
