South Park Kindergarten President Mr. Garrison vs. Rosie O?Donnell

This is one of the best political episodes ever made by the genius of the South Park creators.
It is a take on the election problems candidates create just so they can win. 
This time it?s in a more fitting atmosphere? kindergarten.
This is a cutup of the episode ?Trapper Keeper? but basically only showing the election and the tail end of the main plot because that?s where Rosie gets eaten.
