,AzulaMuerta,2008-07-15T09:02Z,"Umm ... letozeth, try looking at when this torrent was posted. Looks to me that it was from a couple years ago and Shippuuden has been only in the last year or so, right?

It is ALL the songs that were out when the torrent was originally posted so in other words a great help.

Thank you alexytc, two years later and it's still helpful :)"
