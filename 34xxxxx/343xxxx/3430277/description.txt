This LibriVox public domain reading of PG Wodehouse's 1910 
novel 'Psmith in the City' finds the eponymous hero and his 
friend (or as Psmith styles him, 'my confidential secretary 
and adviser') Mike Jackson having just left Eton, and being 
forced to enrol in the service of the New Asiatic Bank. The 
joy of reading Wodehouse is in his other-worldliness. George 
Orwell stated in his defence of PG Wodehouse that although 
the majority of his 'Jeeves' stories were set in the aftermath 
of the Great War, his characters stayed rooted in the 
Edwardian age.
