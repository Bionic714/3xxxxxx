,mofoq,2006-01-31T05:43Z,damn....I hate rar'ed....but I'll bite since this is the first post for this ep.
,filgy,2006-01-31T05:54Z,Files that are split and rar'd like this are much better than one large file because if something gets corrupt you only have to redownload one 15MB rar file instead of the entire file.

with one avi only a few seconds would be missing"
