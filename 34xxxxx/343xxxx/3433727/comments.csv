Hello, I'm french and I read comments that do increase hatred I feel towards the U.S.:
We do not drink tea, the English do ...
We learn other languages: English (with Spanish and German for some)
The french-is the most beautiful language in the world
-Americans seen by the rest of the world are morons

Americans are uneducated that deal only with their ass, in France it is often U.S. programs also stupids each other, where Americans are performing for our pleasure, we saw such a woman who claimed that Europe was a country whose capital was paris ... If you want an example of what we think of you, look at the emissions from Japan and you will understand ... You declare war, you arm the terrorists and the more you are proud! Always proud of your powerful and everlasting ignorance, you are the first power of stupidity worldwide continue, we (Europeans) it makes us laugh ^ ^. On this kill yourself you well with your weapons ^ ^ cya"

First, French is a language. It's better then a lot of languages.
Second, tea is good.
Third, Americans now have to have at least 3 years of classes learning to speak of a foreign language to graduate from high (secondary) school or to get into a 4-year college. Almost everyone I know can speak a foreign language decently. (Chinese, Russian, German, French, or Spanish. I can speak German, French, and English)
Fourth, not all Americans are idiots, and not all Europeans are geniuses. (Also, no one ever said American before you) It really depends on the part of the country you're from. Minnesota, where I'm from, has amazing schools, same with the east coast. But California's schools are awful.
Fifth, most Americans don't support the war in Iraq. Only dumbass Conservatives do.
Sixth, I live in America, why don't I have a weapon? Oh yah, because that's illegal. You know, guns are heavily restricted. And no, every American doesn't have their own WMD
Seventh, if you hate the US, you probable shouldn't watch this documentary. Or maybe you should, because it's made by the typical Liberal American.
Want me to type that in French?
tl;dr: You are all dumbasses.

How is the file?"
