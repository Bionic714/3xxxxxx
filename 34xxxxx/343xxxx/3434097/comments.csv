,Harryhydrant,2006-01-26T00:52Z,"I started downloading this movie off Demonoid originally but after getting a quarter of it there was an tracker error message saying the tracker was the TPB torrents only. So I came over here, grabbed the TPB torrent file and tried to resume. Now I get the same damn error message even though I'm using the TPB torrent! What's going on?"
