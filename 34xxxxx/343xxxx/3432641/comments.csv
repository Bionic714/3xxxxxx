The folks you should be paranoid about aren't the zionists but the ones they sold out to, e.i. the market driven banks, they are the ones who also supported the nazis, not the zionist as revisionists like bf are saying."

please upload some content that refutes Benjamin Freedman. Make a video, an audio file, or cite a book/essay we can consult. Name calling is not productive. Looking forward to your upload or reference."
