,TechWizard86,2009-06-04T02:51Z,"I would like to add a comment to all of you fucking noobs who want to ruin a perfectly virus free torrent.

I used Avast! Home Edition. It didn't even have a false positive. The crack is clean. If you are scared about a virus that doesn't exist then do us all a favor....shut the fuck up and leave this torrent alone. It isn't fair just because you have false positives you have to ruin a good torrent for everyone. Just because it says crack don't automatically assume it's a virus."

,Raventhorn,2009-06-10T17:41Z,"@HellRace
easy man, just because they are 'noobs' doesn't mean they don't know anything... and just because they wrongly accuse this torrent to have a virus doesn't mean you can tell anyone to go f*ck themselves... they are human too, so please, just stay calm and keep seeding :)

@TechWizard86
I agree, too many people assume its a virus then it says 'crack', but that's because there are a heck of a lot of cracks that ARE virusses.

@Everyone
This torrent is virus-free, as HellRace already said it has been scanned with 36 top antivirusses, and comes back clean.
I've scanned it with NOD32 v4 and comes back clean as well, so I'm not worried about a virus."
,neo_one,2009-09-05T12:48Z,"Just to help I check this with one care, avg, macafee, on different computers.  What I found is on my nephews computer running avg it showed issues he was running old crap software and not up to date.  I updated his stuff and there were no problems.......

for HellRace cool your jets a little don't get you shorts in a bind TechWizard86 is right....  if people did not comment you might not be qurrious to check you self.....  people that put up torrents and don't give you the hole thing or give you crap in the torrent bugs me worse those people need to be flogged or at least there computer turned off.......

For the noob's ya you comments are good every one start some where, but if you are going to comment make sure your up to date read and double check if the big bad virus is going to get you like any one that has been on a computer for awhile U R bound to get more than one.......  don't get free software or any other different torrents go to the store please.......  Thanks hope this helps.....  for mistresspandora thanks
