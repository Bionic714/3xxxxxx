While testing a new delta-wing plane for the government, Colonel Steve Austin is almost killed when a mechanical malfunction causes the aircraft to crash. After Steve is rushed to hospital for treatment, Oliver Spencer, the head of the O.S.I. - a top secret U.S. special intelligence organisation - authorises Doctor Rudy Wells to rebuild the injured pilot?s body using state-of-the-art bionic parts. However, although now equipped with a powerful bionic left eye, right arm and both legs, Steve soon falls into depression, unable to come to terms with his situation; but with the assistance of the attractive Nurse Manners he undergoes a course of intense physical and mental therapy designed to help him with his recovery. In an effort to raise Steve?s spirits Spencer offers him an assignment in the Middle East, hoping that the mission will enable him to work out his depression and his feelings for Nurse Manners. Steve accepts, and parachutes into the Saudi Arabian Desert to rescue a captured Arab-Israeli leader from a group of desperate revolutionaries?
