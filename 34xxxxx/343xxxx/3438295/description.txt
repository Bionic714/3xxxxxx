Unlike other "all-star" projects, "GORDIAN KNOT" is primarily the vision of one composer - Sean Malone. He startled the metal and progressive rock world with the self-titled debut release from his GORDIAN KNOT project. The music explores a wide range of styles from jazz-fusion to metal and it explores them successfully. 

"Emergent" includes Bill Bruford on drums and Steve Hackett on guitar, both play prominent roles on the disc. The symbiosis of all musicians involved is probably the most entrancing part of "Emergent". If you are a guitar player you should definately check this out. This CD smokes & burns with superior musicianship and writing! To fans of technical music, this is a dream list of musicians.
