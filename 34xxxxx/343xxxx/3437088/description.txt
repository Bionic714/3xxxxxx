Princess Soft has teamed up with the scenario writer of Final Approach for this love simulation. In Finalist, you play as first year high school student Yoshiki Shirasagi. Yoshikis name is somewhat girl-like, and because the boys dormitory at his school is full, he manages to get into the girls dorm. In typical love simulation form, youll find yourself in the company of at least five girls: Tamamo Sawaragi, Honoka Serizawa, Nomasaho Susuki, Ruka Sonobe and Wakana Sakoi. One of the biggest features of Finalist is that each of the five heroines is drawn by a separate character designer.
