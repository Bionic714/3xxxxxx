A tribute to Minnie-May Hopkins, the most explosive bi-character ever.

Because I ran out of material, the part after the second chorus didn't turn out really great. There was also something wierd about the song's BPM or the grids in Vegas, so i couldn't get the timing quite right, but in the end i am pretty happy with the results.
