I thought I'd post this one since I never saw this or the 2nd Audion Sampler
posted. This gives you a glimpse into what Larry "Synergy" Fast's Audion 
label was releasing in the 1980s. The label was shortlived and was absorbed
by Passport. The tracks varying from adult contemporary to progressive synth
and a mixture of both.

This is the 'First Edition: The Audion Sampler' cd (7 tracks, 1986 Audion Recordings/Passport)
