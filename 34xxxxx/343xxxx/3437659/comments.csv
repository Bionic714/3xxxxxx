FFS dont use winzip use winrar.
Great upload, if it wasnt HUGE corrupt file :D"
,cobramustang,2006-02-02T15:35Z,Same here on the corruption..  What was used to compress this file. and maybe I would suggest that you take the ISO and break it into 50mb files and max out the compression with winrar or zip or whaever your choice of compression is. 
,fixerken,2006-10-01T13:05Z,NOT WORKING/CRC ERRORS/DONT WASTE YOUR TIME LIKE I DID:(
,stratman71,2006-12-09T16:11Z,"Anyone have luck extracting any files from this archive?  I tried winrar3.30 repair with no luck.  Hey shoulder, if you could recompress this one and reseed it would be awesome!"
,cneed4speed,2008-03-29T15:24Z,"Did anyone figure out how 2 unpack this zip file? I have the same problem as everyone else file is corrupt?
Please Help!!!"
,foxboroman,2008-05-26T19:15Z,"You girls give up too easy.  You have to use winzip11 to open it up and it takes a long time.  My e6600 box took a couple hours to unpack the zip.  I have not installed it yet, but everything seem intact.
also, shoulder thanks for taking the time to upload this.  Do you have access to 2005 mustang (GT) manuals?
-Thanks-"
,exarmy,2008-11-12T05:13Z,can someone seed this please.
,bcarriveau,2008-12-04T18:41Z,"Can someone please help me get this to work? i extracted it, installed it to c:tso. That all i understand of the instructions"
,bcarriveau,2008-12-10T21:37Z,DO NOT WAIST YOUR TIME DOES NOT WORK
,bogz_pocs,2009-01-07T08:01Z,"Download Winzip 11 or 12, and unpack with that. It worked for me. Thanks for the upload! I'll seed this for a while."
,Ranofer,2009-01-12T07:23Z,This does actually work if you download Winzip 12.  In the not so far distant future I may turn this into a RAR file for easier un-rarifying purposes.  This is a great piece of software for Ford repair people!

,johnnyoneton,2009-03-24T19:37Z,works great except I'm getting errors when I try to open the wiring diagrams. Am I doing something wrong?
,RockyJones,2009-04-11T08:23Z,"johnny, i get the same error. I'm trying to DL another version of this manual to see if I can get better results."
,RockyJones,2009-04-24T14:35Z,"Johnny, I DLed the full ISO, and have the same problem with the wiring diagrams. :\

took me a long time waiting for a seed for the damned torrent, too. if you want it: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4863570/2000-2004_Ford_Service_Manual_DVD_ISO"
,johnnyoneton,2009-05-30T04:33Z,Thanks Rocky!!  I would really like to have the wiring diagrams.
,puddinhead88x,2010-05-28T14:55Z,I've unzipped this but it won't work.  Can't locate the data file for some reason.
,edenekp,2011-03-02T08:17Z,Able to download and then no contents...
,Tidosho,2012-02-22T16:41Z,"To all people saying it is corrupt, IT IS NOT!! If you actually researched and tried different programs, like me you'd find that 7zip works just perfectly!

Extract using 7zip, and run Setup.exe! Then go to comparethemorons.com! Simples!"
