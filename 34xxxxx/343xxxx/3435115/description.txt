Here are some files that could come in handy if you want to play AOE3 over a "faked" LAN.

You need:

- AOE3 (doh)
- Hamachi
- the files in this package

This package contains:

- AOE3 1.03 official patch
- Original age3.exe (some of you will need this)
- AGE3vpn
- AOE3 mini-image

Installation:

- Install the patch (you might get an error when updating age3.exe, this is because you have a cracked .exe, just ignore for now)
- If you're using the cracked .exe extract the original .exe from age3.zip and overwrite the cracked one
- Extract AGE3vpn to the AOE3 install dir

To play AOE3 over LAN:
- Mount the mini-image using Daemon Tools or some other mounting tool.
- Start Hamatci
- Run AOE3vpn.exe and make sure that the Hamachi IP is selected.
- Enjoy!
