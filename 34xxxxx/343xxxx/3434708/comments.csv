,DjHexor,2006-05-03T19:10Z,"alright. I got this game workin. just put the .exe in the Gamedata folder instead of the BattlefrontII folder.

To download this game you will have to get a bitorrent program. (or wtf it's called)
I use bitcomet. It's pretty fast.

Go get your bitcomet TODAY"

,twillight,2007-05-20T16:10Z,"would be nice if more could seed this...

And elememty dunno what PowerIso is just download daemon tools its the easiest mounting program I think.

Just click on the firs of the rar files(unpack) and  put the so called iso file in any map u want then mount the iso file with daemon tools and when ure finished the installation doubble klick on the isofile again to find the crack simple.

If u dont understand give me a messege"

,max_labraj,2007-08-06T14:14Z,and i have copy over the cracked executable file to the intal dir but cant play the M.F GAME!!!!
,Psuedonym,2007-08-27T10:20Z,"OK, I will answer your questions as best I can.

1) How do I mount the image/ what is an image?
A) You will need Daemon Tools to mount images (it will contain more information) and run the cd. An image is the .iso file, it is like a fake cd.

2) Multiplayer doesn't work.
A) With any game you download it will never work, unless you can get a separate cd key.

3) The game shuts down!
A) I believe this is because of processor incompatibility, although I'm not sure.

4) What is a crack/ directory?
A) A crack makes your computer think that the cd is actually there, in a way. The directory can be found in;
C:\Program Files\Lucas Arts\Game data
there you will find the game .exe, simply drag the crack into the game data file and replace the existing file.

5) Where is the crack?
A) The crack is in the .iso file. Use daemon to open it and go into the crack file.

Hope I was of help!
I too have the shutting down problem so if anyone knows please tell!"

thanks"
,fetish,2008-07-07T11:44Z,"Psuedonym > Wrong, most of the games you crack these days is playable online, the problem with this game is that you can't even create a own game on LAN, since when do you need 'crack' for that, pfft.
Just stupid."
,MM2007,2009-01-03T11:28Z,"@ Glorfindel61:

Yes, it's your PC.  Your video card can't handle the requirements for the game.

I'm in the same boat.

Oh well, I'll just hang on to this until I get a new PC.

Thanks for the torrent, da_rock!"
,Creative1994,2009-01-25T15:15Z,Where's the intall dir i cant find it... ??
,RiseAgainstBaldir,2009-02-01T20:02Z,"Hi all,

Now, I'm not really a complete noob, but I'm not very experienced either.

I'm going to explain properly what my problem is, I hope I'll receive a proper, detailed reply to this.

So, I downloaded this. I installed this. Now, I copied the crack to the gamedata folder. It asked me to overwrite. Okay, I pressed yes.
Now, I tried to run the game. Main pops up. I press start game.
It asks about the LnS thingy or something like that.
I pressed yes, still continue.
Now, something strange happened, it isn't described anywhere else. (I did a lot of research).

2 tabs open up. The game itself (I guess) and a tab called FATAL. I can't open the FATAL tab, nor can I open the Star Wars Battlefront II tab. I can't do nothing untill I press Control + Alt + Delete and then deactivate those 2. Then they disappear, but I still can't play.

Does anyone have an idea what the problem is? When I try to run the crackpatch, same thing happens.
Yes, I have daemon tools, and yes when I do the mount thing, same thing still happens...

Would appreciate help, cause I love this game."

,Obsidian501,2011-10-19T09:18Z,"How do you update this to 1.1??? I've tried running all the official .exe's from everywhere i can think of to no avail, some say wrong version and others say no CD. is this DVD or CD version?"
