,MKrone,2009-01-21T20:39Z,"Ahm, can ya try to hack or whatever the new deskmates, too plz.?"
,Vulcan262,2009-05-19T19:19Z,"You can set the deskmates program to manually update, click on the taskbar Icon and click on settings and set the appropriate area for updates."
,leafstalker,2009-08-18T08:56Z,Mine also keeps asking for an update that it says it does not need... could anyone tell me whats wrong?
,goldberg2046,2009-10-14T23:02Z,"They keep saying they are the demo versions, any ideas?"
,arlips,2011-10-12T15:50Z,"This torrent is very, very, VERY old and outdated. This only works on XP. What a tease. Shame that after all these years no one has updated the crack to work with Vista/W7."
,arlips,2011-10-12T15:55Z,Oh yeah and Oska recently closed up the Deskmates store so really pirating is now the only way to get them. Sucks that this torrent is for legacy computers only (I feel old now that WinXP is considered legacy).
,bugsbnny9,2012-03-05T00:01Z,"I did everything when i downloaded this torrent but I keep getting this message: ""Can't launch Manager.exe!"""
,HaroldCub,2012-05-09T12:31Z,"In order to use this; you need at least one Deskmate installed via Oska site. But they closed up shop, but I believe if you search Google; you can find a pre-installed one to use as a bypass to use this. I did that, but I can't find the file now. 

Good luck and thanks."
,bugsbnny9,2012-05-12T01:38Z,"I have to have an Adminstor's privilege to install any deskmates. But when I didn't need to, sometimes it says ""Failed Deskmates Update."""
,MegamanNeo-X,2012-07-12T22:58Z,"Could Someone Upload The Official Deskmate Manager Module Please? Like Make A Torrent For It, Or Upload It To Rapidshare Or Something?"
