---WARNING---
-Do not press the update button once you have installed the files from Deskmates.exe. 
If you do all of your deskmates will return to demo mode.
-You'll need about 1700 megabytes to install this product. 
---WARNING---


-You need deskmates demo installed before you install all the extra animations.
You can download one of the demos from http://www.deskmates.com, or run the Update.exe from within the directory you wish to install to.
The reason this is necessary is so that it properly registers the files.

After you have installed the demo:

-Execute deskmates.exe.  It'll ask for a directory to extract to.  Copy over all the files that are there from the demo.

-Run the register.reg - this will put the info into the registry saying that all deskmates are registered. 
You can do this by doubleclicking on it and pressing yes in the following window.

-You can start any of the deskmates by going to the c:program filesdeskmates directory, going into a directory (example: tahni3d) and execute the exe in that directory (example: tahni3d.exe)

-Optional: Make shortcuts


NB:
I got these off of the Emule network, I've been after them for years basically, finally found where to get them.
All files compressed and extracted have been scanned for viruses using FreeAV.
Works for me - touch zones and all ;)
