,Oplinger,2006-07-07T14:31Z,"ok...i come back to this and fine people are wanting me to seed it...well theres a problem, i had to reformat a while back hence why i stopped seeding, also now that i see people needing it seeded...well i cant find disc 1 anymore, so i cant really do much about it unless someone wants to send me a disc 1 image...
and well since thats not going to happen, anyone who sees this theres another torrent out there for it here :
