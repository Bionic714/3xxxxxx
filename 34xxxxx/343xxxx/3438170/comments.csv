i did everything. download file, extract it, run it. the instalation it's ok, but the program doesn't open.
then i make the ""touch"" on terminal and run software update, but still not working.

What do i do?

I do not have iLife... it wont work?"
,theti,2008-05-21T11:19Z,"to those having problems with the installation:
the installer is looking for a file called ""com.apple.mpkg.iLife"" in the normally hidden folder ""/tmp"". if it's not there it won't install. so what you have to do is create a file with that name in that folder (any file or folder with this name is ok).
easiest way: in the finder in the menu ""go"" select ""go to folder"", type ""/tmp"", create new folder at that location and rename it to ""com.apple.mpkg.iLife""."
