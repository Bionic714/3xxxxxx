,EliteBubba,2006-01-20T15:08Z,"Intro missing on this one, just so u know if another torrent turns up. Don't quite know about the end, looks good but could be a scene missing if they do a scene with the two brothers in bed like the last few episodes.    Nice speed on download though :-)"
,Bruiser,2006-01-20T20:29Z,"EliteBubba, how long of the intro is missing?

Keep up the good work eztv =)"
,EliteBubba,2006-01-21T00:50Z,"The file starts with the title screen, so opening sequence from A up to where he gets hit by a car etc. is missing..."

,sstackho,2006-01-24T20:41Z,"I love these caps, but I really really wish that the cappers would include the full opening AND closing sequences, all the way through to the end of the ending credits.  Why are they cut off?  Is it just to save a few megabytes?  

I hate watching a show, where it just suddenly cuts out, with no credits and music.  "
