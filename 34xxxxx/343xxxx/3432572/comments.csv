,kaos01,2007-03-25T06:35Z,"Since ""hey you"" is on the set list, This would be from 1st  leg of the 1984 Pros & Cons shows in Europe. The second leg was in the US and did not include Hey You or Eric Clapton. Set list is on the net, but 1st half was all Floyd tunes 2nd half was complete P&CoHH. Brain Damage /Eclipse encore"
,Collingwoodcan,2011-05-18T16:33Z,pros and cons was recorded with clapton and as stated he was on the european leg of the tour and thye had a falling out or clapton had previous commitments and didn't do North america\ the rest of the tour so we had to be content with Jeff Beck at the guitar.  Was this done to give the finger sort of to clapton for pulling out on the tour? ;)
,unvrswise,2011-08-04T02:15Z,"Collingwoodcan... Yes and No. Clapton had commitments and Jeff Beck is a good friend of Rogers and knows his music = it was the natural selection. Both Clapton & Beck had been in the Yardbirds at different times and this had happened before, one left and the other filled the previous ones boots..... you see? 

MORE importantly, this dl is Thanks For the Ride (Part One) http://www.pf-roio.de/roio/roio-cd/thanks_for_the_ride_1.cd.html

& the tracks are jumbled and named incorrectly

It would be good if someone could post Part Two. Is there anybody out there?????????????????????"
