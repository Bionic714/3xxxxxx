what format was this done in.
every song has its song number in front of it and there is no album names. i am deleteing this off my computer and will never ever seed this.
worst ever.
fine if you want to sit there and organize it and put each song in its album.




horrible.
hack job."
,polluks_,2008-07-12T18:13Z,"THX for a nice collection I hope it sounds better than it looks =), but please seed this torrent )."
,omega1147,2009-03-23T16:11Z,"Low bitrate = Low quality I could live with the organization problem if it was in 320kbps mp3 and or FLAC even better, and yes there is a major difference in sound quality especially in the higher frequencies tracks that have heavy symbols or high hats sound really artificial at low bit rates this is how sound compression works please read about sound compression before you complain about FLAC or 320kbps for that matter and posting garbage like this on TPB again.

,RavagedPheonix,2009-06-02T07:24Z,"beundertaker 

The greatest hits album also contains 2 never before released tracks"
,SamSwashbuckler,2012-06-28T04:07Z,"Needed a couple of the ""Rare Bonus Songs"" - thanks.  

Really amateur to label the self-titled album as ""1st"" though, wtf..."
