,z1a2q3,2006-03-14T01:40Z,"Does anyone have ""Beneath the Valley of the Ultravixens""? I think it's Russ' best movie and I've been unable to find it anywhere :S Argh and I lost the taped VHS from when it was on TV years ago."
,paard,2006-05-24T00:26Z,"Hey, awesome release :D

Anyone seen Mudhoney around? Been trying to find for some time now."
,yodie68,2006-07-05T18:51Z,cool slick film

[T],sickboy88,2006-09-12T08:04Z,"I made a pack for everyone to get that contains EVERYTHING needed in order to watch my .mkv/x264 shit, as well as instructions on how to install the programs, and what options to use. 

You can download it from the following link:

Enjoy the embedded music..."
[T],sickboy88,2006-10-10T05:14Z,"A redid this, with a newer version of the codec.  If you want to grab the new one, it's on ""alt.binaries.movies.x264"" the newsgroup I started 2 weeks ago."
,allaallaalla,2006-10-14T14:28Z,"haha. jag kom bara att tänka på en grej nu. du kallar dig alltså sickboy88, jag antar att 88 ska stå för det nazistiska budskapet eller vad fan man ska kalla det. Men i alla fall, för att kunna se denna filmen måste man ha matroska (eller CCCP som det också kallas). 

Man kan säga att det blir en fin kontrast här mellan faschism, kommunism och en billig skitfilm från 60-talet. :P"
,tallkrogen,2006-11-08T23:19Z,88 är en glass.
,lillesvin,2007-01-13T07:22Z,"88 could also indicate a year...
But yeah, awesome movie. I just wish I could dig up Mudhoney, Motor Psycho and Lorna --- all highly recommended to any Russ Meyer fan."
,Ramrod187,2007-01-21T23:26Z,My favourite movie of all time!  Most inspirational- every girl should see this!  I too know it word for word.  
,dunc1476,2007-02-04T13:13Z,"By the time I download all this extra shit and codecs and crap, I could have earnt the money to buy the fuckin thing online and it would have arrived before I got the last download to play it!

I don't like to winge but fuck, what's wrong with putting it out as an avi file or something simple?"
,dunc1476,2007-02-06T12:37Z,"And dude, that link takes you to a picture of a Ninja Turtle fisting a cheerleader and fuck all else.  Download some paint dry videos instead."
,koningnailie,2007-04-12T07:44Z,"It skips scenes and I get very blurry and pixely screenshots and than it flickers to another image again. It does that on my VLC. Very strange. Would love to watch it, but I can't?!"
,dollabill,2007-05-21T12:16Z,No Point downloading this shit! As dunc1476 said why not just put it out as an avi file and stop all the fannying about. for F!@ks sake.
,flobie11,2007-07-26T08:22Z,"Can someone please up Russ Meyer's Beyond the Valley of the Dolls?

...specifically the 2006 two-disc 'Cinema Classics Collection' release. 

Both discs (full DVD?) would be awesome!!"
,secondhand,2007-07-30T15:29Z,"hey! why you have to ruin the opening titles with your logo??, and it's not actually your release.., anyway thank you for the upload. movie is extraordinary!!"
[T],sickboy88,2007-08-05T23:12Z,"Beyond the valley of the dolls is here:

,CHOP857,2007-12-15T01:10Z,I don't know about anybody else but I downloaded this from sickboy88 and the picture was fine but no audio . 
,GwarBeast,2007-12-19T20:38Z,"Fuck this MKV bullshit... complete waste of my time. Nero won't touch it. Tried to convert it to AVI two different forms, wasted two discs and it still won't burn... I'll find a different torrent of it. Thanks for the effort sickboy, but I don't know why you chose to use this pain-in-the-ass medium. "
,stikke,2007-12-22T22:21Z,a complete waste of time and internet connection!!
,cuntycheese,2008-02-16T14:49Z,"i can't believe you put your logo over the begining of the movie.  and what's with the weird format?  this was a total waste.  normal version is here:

,cuntycheese,2008-02-16T14:50Z,"oh yea, to all you pervs.  this is not porn."
,betafin,2008-02-21T05:24Z,thank you soooooo much this is hard to find classic.I will cherish.
,CaptMidnight,2008-03-21T06:16Z,wouldn't this flick look better in COLOUR
,difference,2008-03-22T19:48Z,Fuckin nazi
,Ooiman,2008-05-07T18:32Z,"no porno, perverts!

,magicalnr6,2008-06-07T20:10Z,seeda!
,SlavidQuarente,2008-08-06T01:29Z,"Sickboy88 you have a lot of fucking nerve putting your logo over the beginning of the movie.  That's disgusting and disrespectful.  I've uploaded a bunch of stuff, some here some otherplace, and I never even thought of doing something that repulsive.

,AnastasiaScreamed,2008-11-16T08:38Z,"If I am low on memory will I be able to download these extra files in order to extract it? I want this BAD.......
(I am new to torrents, so I need a little hand holding occasionally)

AnastasiaScreamed

Your screen name courtesy of ""Train Spotting""?
One of my all time favorites too."
,lizardman666,2009-01-06T05:28Z,"I agree, this mkv shit is stupid. There are plenty of normal formats you could use that don't require a nail biting scavanger hunt for software.  Maybe it's just an elitist thing?  Anyhow, I appreciate the uploads but for me, and alot of others, this is a waste of time. Use the link ""cuntycheese"" (shudder) provided.  Works much better."
,wonderlust,2009-04-23T08:17Z,"sickboy88 put some shitty logo over the opening of this, do not download this waste"
,dilbertgeg,2009-04-27T18:17Z,"I have no problem with Sickboy's sick logo on this sick film. So what?  (It it pretty sick.)

Anyhow, try AVIDEMUX.  Convert it to Xvid or auto DVD format.  It works.  Then most DVD makers will deal with it.  I think it's kinda silly to use the MKV format for a 60s B/W flick when Divx would do, but it's not so much trouble.

What's worse is people who ZIP or RAR the entire movie so it cannot be seeded efficiently, and then you have to keep the Zipped and the Unzipped version.

I say, Divx3 or Divx5 esp for older flicks, unless it needs super image quality."
,dilbertgeg,2009-04-27T18:17Z,Sickboy's correct. EXCELLENT DO-NOT-MISS movie.
,argonunya,2011-03-24T23:48Z,"Hey dickboy: fuck you and your faggoty logo.  Dickboy knows how to use mspaint.  I'm so impressed.  This movie is so ""fucking rare"" that there's another torrent with 20 times the number of seeders. Plus it isn't in that .mkv crap. Thanks for nothing, you nazi asshole."
,Stultissimi_Amatorii,2011-10-06T21:14Z,"Thanks, sickboy. Some of us prefer the better quality of .mkv.
