The Gold Series
The Gold Series combines the sound and functionality of advanced vintage gear with classic signal processing methods, producing a highly desirable sound. The Gold series is made in close collaboration with professional musicians, producers, and technicians to ensure we produce a product that does not only sound good, but covers the needs of functionality in the studio and on the stage as well. All processing is done as 64 Bit floating-point operations and all Plugins supports up to 192 kHz sampling rate. Additionally, over sampling is done when it is necessary to ensure the highest quality. All of the Gold Series Plug-ins works in real time (no latency delay), making them the obvious choice for live gigs as well as in the studio.
