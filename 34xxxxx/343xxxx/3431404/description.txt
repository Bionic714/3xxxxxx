Deep Purple is the third studio album by Deep Purple, released in 1969 on Harvest Records in the UK and on Tetragrammaton in the US, who ran into difficulty over the use of the Vatican owned Hieronymus Bosch painting "The Garden of Earthly Delights". Original US editions are rare because Tetragrammaton went bankrupt whilst the album was still being issued. This also lead to the cancellation of a tour supporting The Rolling Stones.
