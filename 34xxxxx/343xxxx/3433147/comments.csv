,SantiagoAtez,2006-01-19T15:51Z,"Have you guys had problems with the torrents getting corrupted sometime through the transfer, and having to start over?  This has happened to me lately, and often i can't finish a successfull torrent transfer until the 3rd time I try.  Perhaps it's my computer?  Or have you guys had the same luck?"

,DarkC,2006-01-19T17:59Z,"Thanks for the Up!

Santiago - Sounds like it might be a HD fault, eg.g a bad sector. Cannot be sure though."
,Gaburieru,2006-01-19T19:21Z,"Jag tyckte Lost hade börjat tappa men sen sista avsnittet så kom jag på mig själv med att vara en jubelidiot. Snuskigt gött är det. Gött gött gött, som Ralf Edström hade sagt.
Sorry för dubbel."
,HelgeFossmo,2006-01-19T20:15Z,seed pzl!
,begamits,2006-01-19T21:10Z,"Santiago, one possible reason for corrupted downloads is a broken memory module - that happened to me. Other symptoms were miscellaneous file errors, ie. Windows was constantly repairing the file system on reboot. Check your RAM with, for example, memtest software."
,Sam3n,2006-01-19T22:14Z,WTF is up with the CT tagfile?? And how do I get rid of it? I'm not so fond of strange files on my hard drive.

,palelnan,2006-01-25T23:21Z,"Hi, maybe a newbie question, but I wonder why some torrents are RAR files which are divided into dozens of small files.

Not all torrents are like this, and I can't say that it's better this way - can anyone tell me why this is done?

As far as I know, movie files are so heavily compressed that further zipping is unnecessary, requiring extra hard disk space and time for unzipping.

Can anyone please tell me?"
,graveszie,2006-01-26T19:17Z,"Check your messages palenan, ive answered your question..."
