,dre8,2006-02-19T11:03Z,"Having problems unpacking the rar-files. Says that one part-file contains a CRC-error.

Got that problem with all the latest ""TiAMO""-files, CSI Las Vegas + Miami included. At least one CRC-error per packed file. Previous files on the other hand worked fine.

Any suggestions what the problem might be?

Thanx in advance! "
