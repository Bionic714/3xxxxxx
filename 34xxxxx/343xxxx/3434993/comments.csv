,stevepick,2006-01-24T10:42Z,"Its probably the new pro 2
yes thanks."
,jeebee,2006-01-24T11:24Z,"i just got the message : it's the Pro version , sorry"
,yachts,2006-01-24T11:43Z,"Thanks guys for this upload. The Premiere 2 PRO. Seems to be difficult to come over the 5.9 % notch though. Tnx again.
Ron"
,Ghostis,2006-01-24T17:31Z,Nice i waited for this one since i heard about it. Thanx man your the best
,Ghostis,2006-01-24T17:40Z,Does anyone have the new after effects?
,brainz,2006-01-24T18:42Z,"Adobe Aftereffects and Premiere can be downloaded from Adobes homepage under Tryout (http://www.adobe.com/products/tryadobe/) - i guess these allso work the same way as Photoshop CS2, which i downloaded and later found a keygen for. Premiere 2.0 Pro needs a CPU with SSE2 support, so check that your CPU supports it before downloading it (it will not install otherwise) - you can use WCPUID ;)"
,Ghostis,2006-01-24T19:00Z,Everything is not included in those tryout versions. I heard that from other people. Are you sure about that?
,Ghostis,2006-01-24T19:17Z,Did all seeders die????
,makeupfx,2006-01-24T21:40Z,It says downloaded 8 times so somebody must be able to seed. Please!!
,sourceunknown,2006-01-25T10:15Z,>>> Pretty please can any just provide us the serial? :-)
,Tanjo,2006-01-25T15:31Z,"This file is a dud. I have a working version on Premiere Pro 2 - tested this morning, but I'm a real torrent noob - if someone can tell me which tracker to put in the upload form I'll get it uploaded. "
,Iceboy84,2006-01-25T15:50Z,Seems to be stuck on 6.8%
,Ghostis,2006-01-25T17:09Z,I take back all good i said. What a shit seeding. :D Hope you get hit by a bus or something else thats hard.... 
,Ghostis,2006-01-25T18:59Z,I take it all back again! I cant deside i hope i get a bus up in my ass soon. Im a nice guy :)
,absent,2006-01-25T20:50Z,The serial supplied with this version doesn't work with the retail iso of Premiere Pro 2 I got off usenet. Haven't finished downloading all the files for this version but I suspect it'll be the trail & crack that's already floating around. The trial version is missing several supplementary features and codecs compared to the retail.
,Iceboy84,2006-01-25T21:32Z,No one seeding this?
,luckylopez,2006-01-25T22:26Z,Someone please tell Tanjo how to upload his working version of PremierPro2!
,puf,2006-01-26T03:30Z,Last number of serial is missing. I think it's a fake.
,puf,2006-01-26T03:35Z,"Completion with 0-9 doesn't work.
What a waste of time."
,jefbak,2006-01-26T17:49Z,I'll wait till some gets the adobe production studio figured out instead. That will have all these apps on one DVD like creative suite.
,Ghostis,2006-01-26T18:37Z,Dont know why it says download 39 times. Everybody else got 8.4% its some kind of fale program he must use.
,puf,2006-01-26T19:01Z,You are wrong. Downloaded: 39 times means only that 39 user have downloaded the torrent via Piratebay. It does not say anything about how many user were  succesfull in getting the complete file.
,MousePad,2006-01-26T20:05Z,'tis propably a fake guys.
,artifaction,2006-01-27T10:04Z,"The real power with these new releases is the  dynamic link funktion, that allow you to work with premiere, after effects & encore in a smooth way (read more on adobe.com) this funktion is only avaliable in production studio and can not be applied to the stand-alone versions. so I would wait for the PS package "
,frequent,2006-01-27T12:27Z,"all new adobe tryouts (premiere, after effects, encore) have mpg dvd functions disabled.The current cracks unlock the timelimit but NOT the dvd features.Any news on the production suite???? 
;-)"
