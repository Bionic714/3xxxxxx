,donana,2006-02-22T15:01Z,"For intalação of the game, it has that to disactivate drive of cd/dvd before installing, ai you only go to be able to faser the installation with daemon, and when will be to play, you has that to disactivate again"
,donana,2006-02-22T15:06Z,"If already it had the installation before the deactivation of drive cd/dvd, you has to use you program SFCLEAN to remove a protection that the game installs in the micron!"
,donana,2006-02-22T15:13Z,"If you to prefer to burn a compact disc:
1. Burn with Alcohol 120, at 4x speed, use securom NEW profile. 
Make sure RAW DAO is selected.                            
(DO NOT USE SECUROM NEW 4/5, MAKE SURE RMPS IS OFF)   

2. When asked, select ""Keep TOC as on source cd,      
write until end of image file""                            

3. Install, when asked use CDKey: 8MQHJ-FRC7R-XYN6N-9SM8E-AW262  
Play from CD/DVD Reader and Enjoy! "
