,Hajime,2006-01-29T01:29Z,This copy is Columbia´s edition.
,klarsen91,2006-01-29T18:34Z,Thanks! But the majority of the people here would probably prefer DD5.1 english instead of just Surround (if that's available on the original of course!)
[V],tomsavini,2006-01-30T19:51Z,I've searched for this movie sooo long. Thanks!!
,shinobiung,2006-01-31T00:59Z,"err, why no one has been able to download this?"
,shinobiung,2006-01-31T01:08Z,"its not this film is it?

,Hajime,2006-02-02T16:32Z,"There are lot of people downloading and there are lots of seeds.

This is David Cronenberg´s Crash, not Paul Haggis´s Crash."
,shinobiung,2006-02-03T17:21Z,"David Cronenberg, this is so embarrasing. This film is LITERALLY GAY, there should be a warning on this film. I am doing you all a favour by telling you this film is the utter pits.

its not horrorfying, its not intense, its not intellectual, its not entertaining, its not porn (it has gay scenes in it). This film is worse than ""Valiant"". No wonder they didnt want to release it any where. What a flop. Cronenberg has really let down in my eyes now, what a dork."
,Hajime,2006-02-04T01:51Z,"Shinobiung you love Brokeback Mountain, really? XDDDD 
This flim is really controversial. Masterpiece for some ones, scumbag for others."
