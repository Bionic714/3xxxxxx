,slixtuh,2009-03-10T20:44Z,"@ mooze (or anyone havign this problem)
This is a common issue, actually, for anyone that has purchased a pre-fab computer then upgraded it considerably without upgrading the power-supply.  Open the case and take a look at your PS and see what wattage* it is pushing (*this could be different if you are outside the US, but I don't know one way or another how other countries measure their e- outout).  Put it like this.  if you bought the computer, then upgraded the video card, threw twice the memory, overclocked the processor, threw a new HDD, and added a few fans to keep it all cooled down, you are PROBABLY underpowering it.  The symptom would be (1) random shutdowns amd (2) application crashes.  With a PS, bigger is better, so I would suggest you invest in as large as you can afford, and your MB can support."
