So, you're an H.264 skeptic?

The visual quality is eye-popping.  I encoded this with x264 R.399 at an aprx 1000kbs bitrate, which looks better than an xvid encode at 1800kbs-2000kbs bitrate.

The soundtrack is the DTS audio taken from the "10th Anniversary Collector's Edition" DVD.  If you haven't watched this movie in DTS, you'rw missing out...in this case, it BLOWS AWAY the Dolby 5.1 sountrack.

Subtitles are EMBEDDED English, English Commentary, and Spanish.

To watch this, you need only 3 things:

1.  FFDSHOW 2005-12-21 SSE:

2.  Matroska Pack Lite v1.1.2 (2005-10-15)

3.  A "DirectShow" media player, such as "Windows Media Player" or better yet, 

"Media Player Classic"

Mini Plot:

Jules and Vincent work as hitmen for crime boss Marcellus Wallace. Wallace is currently dealing with Butch Collidge, a boxer who failed to throw a fight after taking Wallace's money and is now planning to flee the city, but can't leave his father's watch behind. Vincent faces some problems of his own when Wallace asks him to show his wife Mia a good time while he's away. Some of these people redeem themselves and some don't, and all meet an end appropriate to their choices.
