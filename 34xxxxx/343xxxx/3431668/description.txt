This Boston-based punk-rock band is led by guitarist/vocalist/songwriter John Felice. Capable of writing great, catchy pop-rock material, Felice and Real Kids opted for sloppy, beer and drug-induced "who cares" punk attitude, making them darlings of local CBGB's-styled scene (also revered in France), but ultimately keeping them from larger, mainstream success.
