,Phorward,2006-01-15T19:06Z,"OK, thanks for the tip. Do you have a link to some info on the interlacing stuff? Doom9.org? I have captured some other video from analog source and when I compared between mpeg2 (DVD) and mpeg4(XviD) mpeg4 always looked better. I used Nero for DVD encoding (at a lot higher bitrate than XviD)."
