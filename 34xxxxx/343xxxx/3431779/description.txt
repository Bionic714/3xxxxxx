  #*************  The cover say's "could well become the only      #
  #               essential video in your collection"              #
  #    I don't think they could imagine at that time how right     #
  #    they were! This contains some of the best Acid House ever   #
  #    made together with some of the most tripped out visuals.    #
  #    The graphics might not be up to date to todays standards    #
  #    but they sure made the most of what they were able to at    #
  #    the time, emphasising on the trippiness :-)                 #
  #                                                                #
  #    Too bad this one isn't available on DVD...                  #
  #                                                                #
  #    The reason for the large filesize relative to the length    #
  #    and resolution is that this type of video is hard to        #
  #    compress with it's fast changing images.                    #
  #                                                                #
