,grunthos,2006-02-07T10:16Z,Screener!!!
,phanatic9,2006-02-10T21:03Z,If you are hoping there's a lot of violence in this movie you will be upset.  There is no violence at all.  This movie is more about the day in the life of marines waiting for battle.  It is still a great movie but there is no killing at all.  (Except for one scene)
,bajskorv100,2006-02-11T22:03Z,tack ska ni ha. det gjorde ni bra ;)... funkar fint
,jimcoco,2006-02-12T11:36Z,"This is NOT a DVD rip, since the DVD will be released on March 7, 2006.

This is a DVD screener.

smoketon : why on earth would you watch a fullscreen version ?? 

It's like looking at a croped painting : the artist vision and part of the scene are missing.

Instead, what about watching an anamorphic WideScreen, stretched to a huge 4/3 full screen TV because your DVD player does not comme with a 16/9 option ??

Well, go to US : every body does that !
It is like eating crap and demanding for more to me...
