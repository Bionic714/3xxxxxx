Even though Chris #2 was extremely busy recording and touring with ANTI-FLAG, his other band Whatever It Takes did manage to put out two releases, both on A-F Records, and play some shows. Whatever It Takes re-released two older releases, the "Stars and Skulls EP" and "A Fistful of Revolution" together on one disc, and a split EP with friends and label mates THE CODE. Check out the online catalog to pick up either of those releases, and you can also find the split EP on vinyl in our catalog. Unfortunately for all W.I.T fans out there, W.I.T. is no more. Due to the members' conflicting schedules there just wasn't time for it any longer, so those two releases will be the last things available by the band.
