,iguanadeath,2006-09-24T20:38Z,"You save the game by pressing start and clicking on the left or right trigger till you get to the far right of the list on the bottom of the screen and it should say... Load/Save on the screen. 

Save yourself the trouble and don't talk to the Barmaids in the taverns or the game glitches, probably due to data being dropped. I lost over a whole Mb of data when I downloaded it."
