,mma_danne,2006-02-08T00:50Z,"This is fucking bullshit, the two first goddamn VOB-files are great but the next three all show "
,mma_danne,2006-02-08T00:53Z,"....the b-e-g-i-n-n-i-n-g of the game! This is only ONE AND A HALF GAME FFS! Kobes ""explotion"" in the second half is almost completely left out. Bullshit-no-good-ripper-wannabes."
,mma_danne,2006-02-08T02:17Z,"well, hrrm, I wanna take back what I said before. My newbie-dumbass didn´t realise I have to extract it two times with winrar. Sorry about my bullshit remarks, its a great rip!"

anyway, you can just burn the image file and watch it in your dvd player, you don't have to extract the vob files :"

,alexf0685,2009-04-17T18:31Z,"Can anyone give the instruction on how to burn this files to dvd. And please seed, the speed is too slow.
Thanks!!!"
,LEVEL_99,2010-06-22T14:50Z,"After you are done with the download

1. extract the iso file with winrar or winzip or any zipping program, there's two file inside, iso and cue 
(after you extracted the iso)

2. download this really good small burning program, IMGBURN (google it) or you can use any burning program that let you burn iso

(after you installed imgburn)

3. click on the cue file which will automatically open imgburn, click on the bottom right icon that will start the burning process


btw, thanks to the uploader for this, but the video isn't very good. It's really blurry even when i connected it to my tube tv. i guessed cause the game is old but thanks


btw, if you got VLC you can just play the iso file without a need to burn it to dvd to watch it."
,LEVEL_99,2010-06-22T14:51Z,"oops, i meant bottom left icon of imgburn"
