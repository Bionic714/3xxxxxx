I got a hold of a high quality version of the Edge/Lita scene.  I reencoded a clip out of it.  The easiest way for me to do it was XviD to MPEG to VOB to ISO to XviD.  NO quality loss at all though, actually its sharpened.

This is short and all you want to see, the 6 seconds, 2 MB clip, uncensored.

Oh, and if you haven't seen this, you probably only thought it was a nip-slip. Suprise, suprise!

Please help seed this one out, even if its just a few KB of upload.
