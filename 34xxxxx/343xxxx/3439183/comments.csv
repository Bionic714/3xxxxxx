,speakeasy,2006-02-02T20:43Z,preeee - thanks for the covers but . . . I can't see them in either Firefox or IE.  Same is true for other similar sites.  Anybody out there know why this is??
,sirry_iriot,2006-02-03T20:04Z,"speakeasy... not enough details to know why, but I assume you see a page with a marker where the picture should be. So right click on it and try the options, such as save the picture as a .bmp and display it in another program."
,speakeasy,2006-02-03T21:39Z,"No - I don't even get a placeholder.  And if I do a Ctrl-A, Ctrl-V and paste into Word, I still get nothing.
And thanks for the reply :-)"
