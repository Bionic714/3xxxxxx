While driving blissfully through the countryside with his wife and daughter, Hideki Satomi stops at a phone booth to send an email. There he discovers a scrap of newsprint with his daughter's picture on it, and an article describing her death in a traffic accident. With a sense of horrible premonition and foreboding, he witnesses the terrifying automobile collision that had been accurately described in the article. The grieving father becomes obsessed with uncovering the mystery of the newspaper.
