The "Crying For Help" tracks were originally intended to be one piece of music. The plan was to write a 'Theme and Variations' which were integral to themselves, both musically and conceptually. At a later point, it was decided to use separate parts of this composition to act as musical interludes between larger and more intense songs on their two first albums, "Songs From The Lions Cage" and "Pride". 

With this mini album the band have taken the opportunity to put the tracks back together again, whilst using this chance to expand, change and create fresh material. "The Cry" also features a song called "The Healer" written to be the final part of the "Crying For Help" series.
