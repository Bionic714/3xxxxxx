Physics
Inspired by this science. An impression of the playful interaction of the 
atoms and their astounding levels of energy which exist.

Solarsex
Music for sun bathing. A day of finding a quiet place and reclining to 
allow the sun to deliver that wonderful sensation. Closing my eyes to 
view a parade of various daydreams and opening them again to the 
realization of an irreproachable day.

Winter on the Wind
A composition for the time of year when the trees are bare and the 
temperature drops. Various birds begin their migration while others 
stay. The "winter birds" seem to cycle from the open field in my 
backyard, to a limb of a barren tree, then to areas near the house. 
Sometimes I do not see them at all. When the snow arrives and I am 
sitting comfortably by the fire, I think of those who live winter on the 
wind.

Riverbend
When I was young, I lived near a river named "The Shiawassee". 
Children would go there to fish, play and create adventures or 
sometimes just sit on the bank to rest. Without any bridge near by, I 
was unable to go to the other side. Eventually, I realized there was 
only a field with a small community airport. Still, the mystery inspired 
some incredible dreams and this piece of music would easily be an 
accompaniment to one of those dreams.

The Serum
This composition is divided into three movements. The first slams into 
a vertigo playground which refuses to provide an exit but suggesting 
that "The Serum" may be a cure. With no other choice, it is taken. 
This leads into the second movement. Here we find an exotic rhythm 
slowly building. Things are a little quieter now. A bell tolls and a female 
voice forms a vortex around you which disappears as more 
percussion enters. This slams (yes, again!) into the third movement 
which builds only to show you there is no serum here. The final drum 
hits and you are left alone in limbo.

'88
This is a piece which is actually a reflection of a dream I had around '
82. I was at my parents' house for Christmas dinner. On the counter 
near the kitchen was a greeting card addressed to me. One of those 
oversize cards. I opened it to find a grade school picture of myself 
glued inside. The only thing I recall of the writing was that the words 
that were written were alternating by each word, one in pen, the next 
in felt tip ink, some in charcoal. The message escapes me. I looked at 
the postmark to find where this disturbing card came from. No city or 
state was visible, but it was dated '88.

Ave Pladaelio
A piece to pay homage to my early search, techniques, philosophy of 
creating the sound I wish my music to have. "Pladaelio" -- a self 
concieved word of which I know of no origin. Developed eventually into 
a term "Pladaelio-phonics".

The Hill
This composition was inspired by an area of land that my brother Bob 
and his wife Suzy own on the Leelanau Penninsula, near Traverse 
City, Michigan. On his request to visit him, I drove to see this place he 
spoke so highly of. It was mid-summer, as I recall. At one point, Bob 
and I took a walk along with their dogs, Tupelo and Randy. Late 
afternoon was approaching, when we came to this hill. Looking 
towards the woods in the distance, you could see a bit of Lake 
Leelanau. Winds would start to blow and Bob said to me, "Sometimes 
you can almost feel the souls of dead sailors passing by". I will never 
forget that special moment, Bob. Thanks.

Under Shaded Water
This piece could almost go hand-in-hand with a Maxfield Parrish 
setting. Resting underwater in a small pond surrounded by a canopy 
of trees on a sunny day.

Lamento Di Tristan
My own interpretation of one of my favorite 14th Century pieces. The 
idea was to take the basic form and embellish it, as well as create 
some complimentary parts to a piece that so strongly enchants me.

Ela-a (Theme No.2)
A composition to sign-off with. Time to go home. I also think of 
walking along the beaches at night in Sountern California. Ela-a (
another self-conceived word) is this entity which rises from the sea 
just to smile and say good-bye.
