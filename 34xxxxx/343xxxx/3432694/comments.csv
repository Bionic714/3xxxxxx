please answere."
,Shinn101,2008-08-08T01:05Z,"nevermind, i downloaded it. it is gundam seed.

but its dubbed, and i like sub titled becuase most dubbed shows are censored for the american audience, which pisses me off. 

is this an uncensored one, or not? please respond."

,Takashi26,2010-07-09T10:28Z,First of all people plz seed if your going to download. There are way too many leechers. Ive uploaded  almost 50 Gbs already and I may continue to seed even after watching all the episodes but I\'m getting tired of seeding if everyone is going to leech.....anywaynnTo clarify something that the description left out (basically everything)nThis is of course all of the episodes of Gundam Seed.nAll 50 episodes are in .mkv format. ( I recommend using vlc to watch)*nAll episodes have dual audio (English and Japanese) and 2 different subtitles (English for Japanese audio and English only for songs and signs )*nThe video quality for all the episodes are 640x480*nn*i haven\'t checked all the videos but I\'m assuming that there all the same. So far I\'m at episode 14 and its safe to say all the episodes are all the same
,PrinceDastan,2010-07-16T14:37Z,Damn leechers...you have nothing to lose by seeding idiot!!

,jendl,2011-03-08T18:03Z,"well... the speed in the original site where this torrent is from are far more acceptable than here...
haha! "
,FallenPhoenixx,2011-04-05T05:58Z,"much thanks!
does anyone know of a program that will convert this to dvd format and burn it without the subtitles getting messed up? 
im using ConvertXtoDVD, which converts things to the VIDEO_TS and AUDIO_TS folders to burn to DVD. but it really messes up the subtitles for a voice over a radio or something, where their in green and at the top. 
any help with this would be greatly appreciated as this is the only season that i cant burn becuz of that. 
sorry for the long comment"
,bio-venom,2011-06-24T13:06Z,appearently there is only english no japanese audio
,lacus.pril,2011-09-09T03:34Z,PLEASE SEED... WE WANT TO WATCH THIS... THANKS A LOT!
,jayy123,2011-12-15T18:40Z,"the video is quality is mediocre at best
the sound quality is horrific, there's always a horrible buzzing sound
the show itself is one of my absolute favorites and this is the only place you can find the series lest you buy the crappy bandai dvds that malfunction

play with vlc media player and you can switch from japanese/english audio with the option of english subtitles

yes, the quality isn't to die for but its the best you're gonna get so suck it up and for goodness sake seed the damn thing."
