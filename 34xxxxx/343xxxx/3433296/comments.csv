,rets1972,2006-01-21T11:35Z,"I have broadband but i wanted to keep the file size smaller, i could put the whole fist disc on but some people probley want just the rip and not the extras."
,bpatrick,2006-01-23T22:28Z,"Cudman give the guy a break.  If you don't want the movie at this quality then don't download it.  I have broadband, which is only a 2MB down, but the upload speed is just 256k.  Seeding a new 14gb movie would mean that it would be days maybe more than a week, until someone got a full copy.  Thanks for the movie Rets1972, kids will love it."
,rets1972,2006-01-25T17:13Z,Thanks bpatrick for the comment :)
