,_crs_,2006-01-19T03:33Z,"I watched this release through and through and the video quality it was supposedly nuked for is actually quite good. There was a ""proper"" R3 release but the video quality was in fact worse on that when I checked some samples. However, there is a very nice R1 release out now, The.Legend.of.Zorro.2005.R1.NTSC.DVDR-JB."
