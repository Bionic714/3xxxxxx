Canadian UFO documentary that I recorded from TV about 10 years ago. Using a combination of animation, still and film clips to present a straight forward no-nonsense case for UFO reality. Topics covered include the famous Father Gill encounter in New Guinea, and the landings in Levelland Texas. This is not the German documentary of the same name released in 1997.
