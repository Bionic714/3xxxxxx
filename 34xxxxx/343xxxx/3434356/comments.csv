1. Title says keygen only
2. Uploader is VIP, why would he risk his account by uploading virus/malware?"

I started as win2000/Me and works"
,blue_octopus,2010-04-30T03:29Z,"If you have XP, you have to right click on the keygen, select compatibility, run as Windows 2000 and start the keygen. "

This works no problems.
REMEMBER TO DOWNLOAD UTORRENT AND WINRAR TO DOWNLOAD THE TORRENT AND TO UNZIP THE FILE

So many people are retarded when it comes to being a digital pirate(i.e. person who wants to backup their payed for programs that have either been lost or misplaced)"
