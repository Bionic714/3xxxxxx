,wolf359,2006-02-04T03:51Z,It's all bin said....Cheers! Comedy is one thing that hasn't improved over time IMO.Sheer genius!
,karsty,2006-02-04T19:50Z,I've uploaded 1.001 Terabytes of laurel and hardy already! Get it while its hot people...my hard drive needs a break sometime!
,tomazahlin,2006-02-07T14:22Z,"somebody who is fast, please seed volume 1, thanks"
[V],Hexen-NI,2006-02-07T16:13Z,"Hmmmm, I can't access my home PC from work, so I suspect it may not be on the Net and thus - not seeding.  I'll check this and give it a kick."
,denzel-uk,2006-02-09T18:12Z,"good luck is right
stuck on 30 something and not even got it open now since it was 0kb
lets seed ppl plz
thx"
[V],Hexen-NI,2006-02-10T03:00Z,"denzel-uk, no-one else is having the same problem.  Check your BT Client settings, or get Azureus or Bit Lord."
,denzel-uk,2006-02-10T03:35Z,"if i switch to bitlord from my client now in mid download of this laurel and hardy, can i resume downlaoding it in bitlord without any corruption?
thxm den-uk"
,tomazahlin,2006-02-10T06:56Z,"yes, you can resume, just open this torrent (vol 4) in another client ans save the path where you are downloading it now. then you can resume."
,denzel-uk,2006-02-10T12:53Z,thanks
[V],Hexen-NI,2006-02-11T05:14Z,"denzel-uk, if using another BT Client works perfectly - please let us know and also tell us the name of your old BT Client so we all can avoid it."
,seadog,2006-02-14T12:31Z,When do we get volume 5 ?
,vileira1,2006-02-15T00:34Z,vol 5
,prinsallan,2006-02-15T08:32Z,"Thanks for all these great DVDs.

,denzel-uk,2006-02-15T14:01Z,im afraid im still 72 percent on this and i am using Utorrent on the suggestion of rooten..please cna someone super seed or something? thanks for your kindness.
,denzel-uk,2006-02-16T05:03Z,why on earth have most of the comments gone...o well what can we do.
,lilyboobear,2006-02-16T20:52Z,Cheers! Any sign of number 5?
,denzel-uk,2006-02-16T22:01Z,ok..thanks icleolion :P
,wolf359,2006-02-16T22:05Z,Looks like he's gotten fed up :( I know what it's like....Slows your system up like buggery seeding torrents out.
,eminenz,2006-02-28T22:01Z,Respect!
,thatsmine,2006-05-21T22:12Z,awesome ! i hope these L&H movies will still be seeded as i jump a bit late on the wagon :P
[V],fac051,2006-06-24T14:37Z,"have got volumes 1 - 14 stacked up on Azureus, with the exceptions of Vol 5 & 11 .. does anyone have links for these ?? any idea when Vol 15 is out ? 
This is an awesome collection and supreme effort from Hexen ... so everyone help out as much as .. i will do more than my bit too !!"
,maudia,2006-11-02T13:07Z,"One of the best torrents of all times. But only found them in October. Could you reseed the DVDs 5,6,7,10,11,12 and 13 ? Seeding 3 DVds at the moment (the most I can do)."
,Drowlord,2008-02-10T18:34Z,"As promised, the entire collection's DVD Rips in XviD format: http://thepiratebay.org/tor/4021071/Laurel_and_Hardy_Movies_-_DVDRips_-_142_Movies"
,GAZZA2008,2009-05-28T01:32Z,"wheres 5,6,7, Hexen? please."
,Ianpbx,2009-09-06T20:25Z,"This is not a criticism, just a wish that someone would upload only the black & white ones, as the colour is not only fake but also crap. And also transcoded to XVid format for smaller size with good quality."
