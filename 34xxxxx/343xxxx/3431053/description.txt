Blockheads are invading the neighborhood Block Party. Your goal is to rid the streets of these square menaces. Rotate groups of four blocks left or right to match like-colored blocks. Line up four blocks of the same color and they disappear from the playfield. As the pieces are disappearing, you can continue to connect even more blocks to the same group - chaining together attacks. Now youre on your way to Blockhead annihilation!
