Here is the fifth day of the 15 day tournament!
Day 5 was broadcast on Thursday January 12, 2006.
I know the tracker is acting up a lot, but please seed a lot, and be patient :-)
Seeding makes you a better person!  Seeding is cool!
Plus, I am running out of HDD space, so I am starting to stop seeding the older torrents, regardless if I am the only seeder left, which, sad to say, I often am (even after I have a ratio more than 15)
