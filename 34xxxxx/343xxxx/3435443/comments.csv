,gmeades,2011-09-25T02:31Z,"This is Dick Sutphen's ""Getting By On 4 Hours Sleep"" Hypnosis.  Dick is a very good hypnotist who has been around since the 70's with a very extensive line of products published on his Valley of the Sun label. As with any self-hypnosis product, you need to listen to it for at least 30 consecutive days if you expect to get the promised results.  If you don't do this, first of all, you weren't serious about wanting the change to begin with, and second, you don't understand how these tapes work by changing your mental habit patterns, and that takes time. If you do what you're required to do, you will get the results the tape promises. Don't plan on playing it once or twice ""just to see"" and expect to get results. 30 days.  Make the commitment and get the results."
