,bmcd,2006-01-31T07:59Z,What exactly could i do with these?  Is there some way to flash the bios on a PSX?
,jiggy_247,2006-02-02T01:19Z,"Could be, Don't ask me. I jus't love emulating stuff.
And somebody wanted bios-files."
,Malum,2006-02-09T07:55Z,Seed please. =)

,Erikatropos,2006-04-23T07:42Z,PSX BIOSes can be used for emulators.
,Junx,2007-04-21T23:34Z,"Thanks!

I hate how these game systems need a BIOS to complete the emulator, though.  None of the Nintendo console emulators have required one, for example; just the Sony ones."
,SniperFox,2007-07-11T13:29Z,"@Junx

It's because, you know, they don't WANT their consoles hacked/pirated like this, lol."
,AxBanger,2007-10-09T01:06Z,"Took the chips out and hooked them up to a ROM reader, ran homebrew that read the BIOS and dumped it out over a port or wrote it to a memory card... Lots of ways."
,ohwordd,2008-02-12T04:12Z,"Great upload, thanks."
,XenoSphere,2008-03-26T00:58Z,"@ Junx

Some GBA emulators need a BIOS file."
,cantcomplain,2008-04-29T07:46Z,"Holy crap... do you have ANY idea how long i've been looking for these?

I LOVE YOU"
