,hellknight.gok,2006-02-18T22:41Z,"just did a search on the net, and .daa is a filetype belonging to an image-program named poweriso - the screenshot I saw suggests it's a sort of combi between isobuster, magic ISO and alcohol 120%

with some luck, isobuster can open it.
Once the download is finished, I'll see how to open it, and let you guys know"
,hellknight.gok,2006-02-19T10:55Z,"nope, isobuster can open it, but can't find the files in it.
