Buy the real version if you like it."
,joeypesci,2007-01-01T00:29Z,"Doesn't work.  Opens a DOS box then closes.  Suggests it's a possible virus.

Def not working."

,waronflesh,2008-08-16T17:14Z,"DEMO VERSION uploaded by the developer. Look at ""adrianmoleskin"" and ""helenmenezez"" and ""richarddworkins"" profiles to see that they are pimping this fake version as the real thing to thwart pirates.
