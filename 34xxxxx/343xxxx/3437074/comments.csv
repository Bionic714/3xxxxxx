,donkeymand,2006-01-29T12:17Z,er der et seriel nr med for registrering???
,Catalyst666,2006-02-01T07:11Z,Diskeeper has never needed a serial. Ever. Not since it originaly came out has it ever had a serial.
,Dunno_Me,2006-02-27T20:12Z,Is this a trial version
,ALIEN68,2006-04-09T00:27Z,"But if itd without serial or anything,then its just 30 days trial."
,Catalyst666,2006-04-10T09:50Z,"believe me, this is the full version."
,ALIEN68,2006-04-11T00:14Z,"So you meen that you only install it and thats all? No registration key,no patch no crack is needed? Diskeeper is not freeware."
,Northernorbie,2006-04-12T07:13Z,"True, you can just install & run it, but it does ask you to register. Im searching for serial#s (patch/crack/etc) so Ill let you know when Ive found one that works."
,MItch Cumstein,2006-04-20T05:47Z,"Registration and activation are 2 different thing mmmkay, activation is not required for this work. They want you to register so they can inundate you with emails to buy the other shit they sell. "
,Dannnnnny,2006-04-20T14:33Z,"Yep mitch is right, you DO NOT need to register this product what so ever. all you do is click never register, that's why you will probably never see this torrent with a crack/serial. just run, install and use. That's it."
,mikeceder,2006-05-14T12:35Z,"I have probelem with Diskeeper and F-sesure firewall. Someone can help?????

I can't start Diskeeer anylonger:
""Diskeeepr failed to conect to the service. Check the windows event log for more details.""

What can I do????
