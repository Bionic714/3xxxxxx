(sorry, Genesis,Yes,King Crimson)."
,eggewert2,2006-01-28T11:24Z,"Indeed: Yes, Genesis, ELP, Symphonic Slam, or even King Crimson and Gentle Giant (very good as they are); none of them can compete with U.K; the very best symphonic rock band ever. Also, it's amazing, even without Allan Holdsworth who is a truly unique guitarist and one of my personal favourites (alongside such masters as David Rhodes), the second album Danger Money is roughly as good as the first album. The other guys do a fantastic job filling the gap from Holdsworth. Download, be amazed and support the best prog rock band ever by buying some hard copies from your favourite dealer!"

In fact, I agree so much that I chose to go out and buy their debut album (U.K.) and order their second album (Danger Money).  U.K. was the first band to introduce me to the world of prog artists and they still remain one of my favorites.  King Crimson, Yes, Genesis, and Rush are all greats as well, but for me, U.K. is just perfect.  Also, if you are interested, check out National Health, Gentle Giant, and obviously ELP and Dreamtheater for serious prog fans!"

Buy their stuff!"
