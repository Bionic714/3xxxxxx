,nerull69,2006-01-11T19:08Z,ntsc?
,Tyramead,2006-01-12T02:53Z,yes NTSC.
,rudolfo2,2006-01-12T18:42Z,The movie is 229 minutes long.You can't put this on only one DVD.No way.
,masterbluestar,2006-01-12T22:59Z,It is released as a 2 disc set as the movie is real long. Looks nice though I just rented it recently from Blockbuster. One of the best movies of all time. A must see.
,masterbluestar,2006-01-12T23:00Z,"so, the question is how did you fit it on to just one disc? Unless you spliced it and then re-encoded it; made the quality real low which would make for an ugly looking film."
,Tyramead,2006-01-13T02:59Z,"I just copied the dvd to a folder then made azureus make a torrent file out of it.  The DVD plays fine. It ain't even a DVD9 but it is clear. well no one has completely downloaded it for comments the latest is about 87% an hour ago.
This is one movie I hunted for. It stillpuzzles me how they'l fit it into one dvd. mebbe some scene were deleted. I didn't notice any tho. "
,Tyramead,2006-01-13T03:29Z,"WEll Ijust checked the downloads.
11 made it. Any comments from them?"
,Tyramead,2006-01-14T00:43Z,The video is 2MBits which is a lttle over VHS on SP mode something like SVCD quality. well the movie did fit complete in one disc and the quality is not lousy as speculated.  I can't get my hands on an HD format. Sorry. but try it. Tyramead wouldn't put one over you.
,MrSuspend,2006-01-21T17:43Z,"Some compression artifacts and it seems to be pan and scan. Still, decent quality and a truly great film. Worth the download IMHO."
