At the start of this improbable thriller innocent bystander Tom Broadbent is
riding his horse through a New Mexico canyon when he comes upon prospector Stem
Weathers, who's just been shot. Before Weather dies, he gives Tom a notebook
filled with mysterious numbers, asking him to pass it on to his daughter. Taking
this assignment to heart, Tom puts himself and his wife at ever greater, more
pointless risk as he tries to deliver the notebook. Soon the Broadbents find
themselves the target of the prospector's assassin ù- a jailbird hired by an evil
British paleontologist seeking the perfectly preserved remains of a
Tyrannosaurus rexùas well as a rogue government operative who's trying, with a
commandeered army squad, to kill almost everyone in the book. Lively yet
ridiculous, the narrative loses all plausibility as it becomes clear that the
characters do what they do solely in order to keep the plot churning to its
conclusion. The recent real-life discovery of a Tyrannosaurus rex fossil
containing soft tissue makes this particularly timely.
