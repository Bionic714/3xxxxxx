,far_isle,2008-01-14T19:37Z,"You Guys ROCK!  I made a request for the Bird's Eye View files Vol 1- Vol 5 and less than 24 hrs. later 1, 2, 3, & 5 are done and I am seeding these for folks 24/7 at least to a ratio of 4 or 5 to 1.  Only the Hard Winter Vol 4 is left, stuck at 27.7%.  Any reseeder to fulfill this wishlist would be MOST appreciated.  Thnx for the fast recovery!"
,far_isle,2008-01-14T22:40Z,"and just like I said above, the rescue has come!  Thnx for being SO quick and kind to reseed.  Within 2 HOURS we have folks keeping torrents alive after a simple request.  Well on the way to 100% now.  Thnx so much."
