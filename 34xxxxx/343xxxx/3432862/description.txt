This isn't a book, so I didn't know what secion to put it in. This is the cd that is included with "A Concise Introduction To Logic" 9th edition by Hurley. I believe that it is just the practice tests, but I haven't really looked at it. It should not be used instead of a book. This is if you lost your copy, or you found a cheap version of the book online that doesn't include the cd, but you need it. I hope to do the same thing with the practice tests; but that will only happen given the right recourses, so I wouldn't count on it.
