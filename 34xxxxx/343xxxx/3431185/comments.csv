,tusenochennatt,2007-11-12T19:39Z,what program should i use to open the flac files?
,Dan33185,2008-02-23T00:24Z,"1) There is no way this is lossless considering the size of this torrent.
2) This is not the Fruit Tree box set, there would be about 30 files if it was."

,LezDawson,2009-01-10T20:51Z,"Thanks for this.  The best I could find on R@pidSh@re was a crappy 192kbps, which is quite unlistenable.  Can't wait to get this, thanks."
,krum,2009-10-09T22:42Z,"Thanks so much for this and the other Drake albums. God, what a waste of talent."
