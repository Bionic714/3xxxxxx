,xenu dot net,2006-01-30T23:40Z,The film won the top gay prize at the Berlin Film Festival and is considered by some to be one of the best lesbian films of the decade. http://www.planetout.com/entertainment/news/?sernum=47

,ninjasource,2006-10-24T04:48Z,"when international people rate fucking amal everyone (almost) gives it 10 stars out of 10, and praises it so much... interresting, especially since ive compared the english subs with swedish speech, and its only ~75% accurate (swedish is very difficult/impossible to translate 100%)... listen carefully to the characters voices (how they express themselves) and u will probably understand some of the stuff untranslateable anyway.

international reviews (from all over the world):

,Donate,2006-12-17T09:25Z,"LOL! Well, swedish is actually one of the closest languages to english, and is one of the few that  can be translated almost accurately to english.

The world is bigger than northern Europe...

(Other languages with the same quality is norwegian, danish, islandic, german and dutch).
"
,ninjasource,2007-02-16T05:06Z,"yes swedish is easy to translate when it comes to ""regular"" text and such... but when it comes to vivid conversations its nearly impossible to translate well...
...in sweden theres a special category of words that is very rare in other languages... and those words meanings r very hard to explain, but if they r used in a sentence u can express alot of feelings just by using them... for example they r used when u try to comfort someone who's sad, or if u try to be cute about something... or if u need to bring bad news to someone... or if u wanna play a trick on someone in a ""friendly"" manner... 
with the help of these ""special"" words u can (in swedish) express yourself in a much more personal way than without them... just add one of these words (and the right tone to it) on a regular sentence and it will be expressed in a nicer and more personal way... 
...in fucking 책m책l there r just so many words that belong to this ""category"" so the only way u can experience them is by listening to the tones of the actors (actually, many of the international reviewers of this movie have laid notice to the ""tone"" thing)"
,ninjasource,2007-02-16T06:06Z,"perhaps i should give an example too...:
in english if u argue with some1 about who's right and who's wrong, a typical question to counter an argument could be: ""they did this, and because of that XXXXXX happened, right?""

the word: ""right?"" could be interpretted in an offensive and humiliating way... (the other person may think: ""like i didnt know that?"")... so in swedish the counterargument (with the additon of the ""special"" word) would instead look like this: ""they did this -ju-, and because of that XXXXXX happened -ju-""...

the word ""right?"" can (if wanted) be removed completly thanks to the word ""ju"" (pronounced more like ""yu"")... the word JU means something like: 
""if i'm not wrong, then this is fact (=have happened, but correct me if im wrong""
...the purpose of this is to answer in an polite, humble and uncertain (and not self-crediting) way... and to present ""facts"" without putting the other person in the humiliating position to having to answer an ""right?"" statement...
...this is some kind of an example of one of these words...
P.S. i know that u could just as well say: ""AS WE BOTH KNOW they did this, and because of that XXXXXX happened""... but: ""as we both know"" is not such a humble and not self-crediting way as the word: ""ju"", since ""ju"" adds the touch of ""uncertainity"" and ""innocence"" to the statement, and it may become the difference that dont let the arguement escalade into something worse..."
,dj_fabio,2007-03-23T15:15Z,Could someone please seed

,DragonChaserKev,2011-12-12T08:07Z,"Well it is a very good film, well worth the watch d/l.  Funny of the main two actresses it seems one stopped acting altogether and the other did very little acting afterward.  Something like that, you can wiki it for details."
,art_fargunkel,2012-04-06T14:54Z,Great upload and a very interesting film.
