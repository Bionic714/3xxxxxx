,sonoca,2006-01-24T04:26Z,Ok i found the problem i was'nt thinking now the problem is fixed
,sonoca,2006-01-24T19:01Z,"no i think the terrorists are the people who blew up the trade center, and anyone who allies with."
,1sh1ki,2006-01-24T21:12Z,"WTC was terrible but does that give your armed forces the right to kill hundred's of thousands innocent people ?




"
,sonoca,2006-01-24T21:58Z,So you saying that freeing Iraq and getting that tyrent out of power is the wrong thing to do. People always turn a blind eye to countrys like Iraq but everyone talks about world peace and unity.
,1sh1ki,2006-01-24T22:24Z,"Did Iraq ask the United States for help ? If so then why are they still fighting ?

The way your country act's now will end with that the whole world will hate everything that U.S.A is all about........."
,sonoca,2006-01-24T22:58Z,"Wait that made no sense. Just saying
And First off how about the people that Husain killed he had rape rooms for Gods sake.
Secondly if we leave now Iraq will be in worse state then when we came in
And freeing countries is wrong? the only reason that other countrys are not helping is because they are scared and dont care others but themselves"
,sonoca,2006-01-24T22:59Z,I know there are country supporting The US but countrys but other countrys just did not listen
,1sh1ki,2006-01-24T23:19Z,Sure as soon someone dont support the US we are afraid...of what ? That you will you come and free us too from something that we didn't ask for....I think oil is the reason you invaded Iraq nothing else...or maybe baby Bush just had to try and finish what his father couldnt do...
,sonoca,2006-01-25T00:06Z,"would there be enough oil in Iraq to justify spending 1 billion a month and wasting  1000 of our soldiers. I think that idea is just dum, wat mad man would start a war all for just money? We are fighting for freedom and to stop the terorrists that s it"
,sonoca,2006-01-25T00:08Z,I think we should stop this childish game. Lets agree to disagree
,BBinky,2006-01-25T00:47Z,"No one but a moron would look at this footage and say ""Great - we're murdering people"" This will just lead to more Americans being killed. ""Shock and Awe' just pissed off people. 
You should get out now and let them fight their own battles."
,sonoca,2006-01-26T23:58Z,NO its great since with them a intire convoy maybe 20 soldiers would have died
,itchyleg,2006-04-12T04:45Z,Made for the pleasure of the world's biggest terrorists.
