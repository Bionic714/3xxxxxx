,fallout11,2008-03-28T00:42Z,"Yangman, ""seeding"" is where you leave your Torrent client running, so that others may get parts of the torrent from you, the same way you got your copy from still others. In short, you ""give back"" for leeching (or ""taking"").  It generally costs nothing other than some processor cycles, assuming you don't pay for your connection on a per-minute or per-hour basis."
,kissliam,2008-10-04T18:49Z,"thanx, will seed"

,paper1111,2009-07-16T22:39Z,"i personally like anime in ENG. mainly cause i dont have time to learn Japanese and i dont like ""reading"" my way through a movie, cause you miss all of the animation because your constantly looking at the bottom of the screen.

on top of that most female characters are annoying as fuck in Japanese. theyre voices are too cute and high pitched. "
,xushi,2010-02-11T13:30Z,"Bah.. What's going on here? It's been days and I'm stuck with 95.25%.. I can only see 4 people seeding, and none have 100% (none even have 80%)..... "
,shadowskilled,2010-03-15T04:29Z,The actors who provided the English dub for the Seed and Destiny series were absolutely excellent. Whilst i would normally agree with the earlier comments this series is worth getting in english. Japanese is good too tho. Respect to alexytc
,Blade0047,2010-06-30T21:19Z,does this have English audio??
,Paulruless,2010-06-30T23:11Z,"i agree with shadow, this is pretty good in english. but if i can't get it in english ill gladly settle for subtitles"

,newtothis92,2010-12-03T06:05Z,i don't care what any of u guys think most if not all anime are better in japanese. English dub dilute the meaning of what the characters actually say and sometimes paint the wrong picture of the characters and the anime on a whole. Not to mention the japanese voices are way cooler.
,Nipplator,2011-01-23T07:07Z,"@Unsweet
My brother is dyslexic and is unable to read the subs, So I have to be very careful about the anime that i get for him. He loves the shows, but is unable to read the subs, and my voice acting isn't that great. That may be one reason why a ""bloody living hell of asswipe spawns from Venus's hidden moon would want ANY anime in english dub"". Also ""ass wipe"" is two words. Thanks Alex for the torrents of this series."

,Southparker,2011-08-23T20:55Z,"Hey English hating weaboos, if you hate English so much why are you speaking it? PS, translated text has the same context as translated verbal, so your points are all invalid. Kthnxbye"
,jayy123,2011-12-22T00:02Z,"haa no. i always go for the english dubs no matter how ""horrible"" the voice acting is. you guys do realize that none of you really understand japanese and as such can only make the assumption that japanese dubs are better right? the only thing you can say for certain is that you do not like the english dubs, for all you know the japanese dubs are even worse but unless you know japanese you cant say for sure huh?"
,watamouri,2012-05-17T14:17Z,seed please!!! :) thank you guys
