,fuzzyka,2006-01-18T21:25Z,"Wankan, besides the unfortunate nickname (just kidding!) you are THE MAN! Thank you for taking the time and of course the precious bandwidth to seed this.

A big thank you from me!"
,wankan,2006-01-19T12:43Z,"You're welcome . Just for interest there is another epsiode being made at the moment called Sharpe's Challenge http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0480002/ .

Should be interesting ."
,wankan,2006-01-20T14:03Z,Well this has to be the slowest upload I've done . I've a share ratio of 1.812 = 1.19GB and still no other seeders . Where does the missing data go ?
,Kaxes,2006-01-20T14:44Z,Dont know... seems Im stuck at 96%...
,gorky,2006-01-24T19:40Z,seed plz. thank you for the good work
,huldre,2006-10-17T04:11Z,"Thank you very much for the Sharpe series!  It is excellent and I'd missed the last two episodes as well as ""Challenge"", so thanks again."
