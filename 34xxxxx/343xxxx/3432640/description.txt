Pls read this to avoid unpleasant surprises:

-1st of all, this is part 2 cuz part 1 is here: http://thepiratebay.org/details.php?id=3418382
-like b4, its a collection of various ufc fights, mostly impressive KOs and submissions with some focus on big name fighters. there may be very few matches that went to decisions that i left in the collection if it was between 2 big fighters.
-this contains matches frm ufc 22-43
-once again, if ur only interested in certain matches u can open the torrent and select for only certain files to be downloaded
-some good stuff to look for: frank shamrock v tito ortiz, pedro rizzo matches, arlovksi matches, couture/liddell 1, lidell/vitor belfort, tim sylvia, + more.

-i dont have anything earlier than ufc 22, but i'll slowly work on getting it. it'll be a long while though. enjoy, and thanks for ur appreciation frm last time. :)
