,revenant666,2006-10-29T05:18Z,"u download and open the torrent with whatever program u use, and inside ur program u should be able to choose only certain files to be downloaded. uTorrent allows this for sure - u just select the torrent inside the program, click on the files tab, and u can select files, right click, and select 'do not download'"
