,lynott49,2006-02-02T20:15Z,"Hi!
This is the DUBLIN show from the last tour 1983. BUT there are some things why you have to like it, it is real a killer DVD!

It is the best picture and sound quality of this concert i have ever seen, the picture is crystal clear!!
It is a real DVD with menu, a cover to print and so on.

I don't how they made it, but this comes 100% from the original RTE (irish television) master tapes. The quality blows you away.

Have A LOT of fun,
I HAVE!
