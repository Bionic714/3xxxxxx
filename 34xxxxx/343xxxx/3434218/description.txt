        For the first time on DVD we are proud to present the                  
        legendary Phil Lynott and Thin Lizzy in the phenomenally               
        successful 1983 `Thunder and Lightning Tour` performed in              
        his native Dublin. As an introduction to the programme, if             
        any were needed, Phil`s fellow band members Eric Bell and              
        Brian Robertson reminisce about their years performing                 
        together; they are joined by Production man Nick Tauber and                                                                                               
        all three have their own special memories of the iconic                
        driving force behind supergroup, Thin Lizzy. Also                      
        contributing their own recollections of the guitar playing            
        genius are footballing legend George Best and musician Brush
        Shiels who together lead us into the explosion of sound of  
        what sadly proved to be Thin Lizzy`s final tour. Included in
        the spectacular set are all time favourites such as `Whiskey
        In The Jar` and `Still In Love With You` plus many more in  
        this concert ignited by the charismatic force that was Phil 
        Lynott.
