,Drake9669,2011-10-30T22:45Z,"Running Windows 7 on a 64-bit system. None of these will work. Anyone know how I can get them to work properly?

When I double-click the application to install or run the program, I get an error message that says it is not compatible with my operating system."
,hayz05,2011-11-08T13:44Z,THIS GAME CONTAINS A TROJAN HORSE. My antivirus detected and removed a trojan from the TIM1 folder. DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!!!
,poopfruit,2012-01-16T07:55Z,"Of course this game doesn't work on Vista or Win 7.  You need to get DOSBox.  How you might ask.  First you need to learn to Google.  BTW, awesome torrent :)"
