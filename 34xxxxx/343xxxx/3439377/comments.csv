,Igorigor,2006-02-03T18:54Z,hmm.. i have a problem with the patch.. it can't find the dap.exe file althoe it's in the dir.. can you help me?
,branzmf,2006-02-03T21:21Z,"First, Close the dap - make sure if you alread patched...

Move the patch.exe to the dap folder. Example: ""C:Program filesDap"".
Open the patch, click ""Patch"" and enjoy it... if you still have problem I can send the file dap.exe already patched."
,Igorigor,2006-02-03T22:28Z,"Thank you for your advice. The problem with the patch was because i selected the ""make backup"" option. After I canceled that... it worked perfectly. GREAT UPLOAD.. thank you again."

,mushukyou,2006-09-24T02:05Z,"The ""Always Resume"" is not activated within the options of DAP.
I thought the whole point of getting premium was to have that option?
It requires an email and registration code.. for which then it attempts to verify online.."
,jan1749,2006-11-25T20:39Z,"works fine

,AMD freak,2007-07-10T07:16Z,"sup all?
I have been using DAP about 5 years now. It has saved me 1000's of hours in dload time and lost files from failed non-resumable dloads. It will let you resume dloading in case your connection drops out (using wireless), phone goes dead, electric goes out or ur PC crash etc... great for all you dial-up users especially. I wouldn't even bother trying to dload large files using Dial-up, without using DAP unless your a gambler and feeling might lucky! lol
Dial-up is what it is fellers ..... slooow. DAP will still allow you to get MAXIMUM speed out of ANY connection! 

What it does is:

It finds mirrors (more sources) to download the file that you clicked on from so the speed of the dload is ALWAYS faster than dloading the normal way (from 1 source only) without DAP. Winblows ONLY dloads a file from one source. If dload does not complete 100% and something goes wrong your screwed and have to go back and re-dload that file all over again from the begining (!@#$%*) if you can remember where you found it on net  but not with DAP, those days are long gone!
That's just a few of the features/benefits of using DAP there's a lot more! Click this link to read all about it!  http://www.speedbit.com/"

,royalspin1970,2008-01-21T03:03Z,"WARNING !!!!  I downloaded this thing and scanned it before I launched Win rar  and launching the Application and found a win32 virus.Now maybe this is because of the crack , and my Avast Virus scanner is mistaking this but normally Ive had patches that don't show up like this which makes me think twice about Downloading from this person."
