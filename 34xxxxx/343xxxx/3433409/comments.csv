,BrimstoneVomit,2006-03-15T22:27Z,"Wow, looks like a lot of work got put into this based on the description. I only hope that it'll get here... Not to mention I hope my game stops crashing to desktop, which could be due to the Tygrys ""massive addon"".

Is there a site where I could check for news and expansions to this mod?"
