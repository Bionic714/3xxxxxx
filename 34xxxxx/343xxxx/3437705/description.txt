Hi guys.
at last, released!!

besides the piratebay tracker, also add:
 
http://seedtracker.net:2710/announce

i also created a backdoor tracker:
this address points to my machine:
 
http://rediew.no-ip.biz:6969/announce

VERY IMPORTANT:

IM a Single lousy 320kbit home user link, and im susceptible to disconnections! Even if the torrent seems dead, IT IS NOT!!
This is a very high demand torrent, please be patient and STAY CONNECTED!!

Please BE PATIENT WITH THE TORRENT!!

I STRONGLY RECOMMEND USING the latest AZUREUS client. It makes available a trackerless seeding. Be sure to install the CHAT plugin, the DHS and DDB and Distributed database and I2P plugins .
Read about on the "FAQ" on how to import torrents started on other clients.

Right click on the Torrent, and make sure you select ALL PEER SOURCES and ALL NETWORKS on the "advanced" tree.
