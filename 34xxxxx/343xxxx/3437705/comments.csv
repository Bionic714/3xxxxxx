,somoney,2008-01-23T06:11Z,"Masters was just tacked on  =)
 It had no tie in to the Robotech Story accept by the Voice actors who occasionally mentioned Admiral Hunter and his return."

i sure want to watch this"
,otisb,2008-08-10T07:15Z,Does anyone know were the first section of this series is ?
,rebelzion,2009-03-22T19:53Z,"klynke - I think that I have ""The Masters"".  I a DVD 1 and DVD 3.  The DVD 3 is in a audio_ts and video_ts ""type format"".   the audio_ts seems empty, but the video_ts has a bunch of files that my computer does not recognize.  they are .BUP & .IFO & .VOB  The entire file is 4.35 Gb.  I am new to the P2P and not too bright, so if someone wants to walk me though how to upload this and maybe help me to watch it I'm game.  Please be patient with me.  The DVD 1 is in a .nrg format.  Media player classic can play it, but the timing falls of and the time line is awkward.  Meaning sometimes it plays and the sound gets ahead of the video and i can't skip fwd or back without the video freezing.  So let me know, i will check back for the next few days or so to see if there are any takers."
