unrar all the files to a folder anywhere. It really doesn't matter. To run the game, use SCORCH.EXE. If it randomly ever decides to not work, run FIX.BAT and then try to run the game again."

,charltondspelljr,2008-04-10T19:54Z,FURTHERMORE YOU're BRING VIRUSUS FROM SOMEWHERE ELSE TO PIRASTE BAY...... C'MON MANNN...
,Nailih,2008-06-10T06:55Z,"Lol, ""piraste bay"". I'm just looking for a registered copy, since I already have the shareware version. Too bad nobody has it.  :("
,footron,2011-03-26T03:03Z,"woo-hoo!
had a copy, but it became corrupt over the years.
Thanks for the upload!!

Works great.  Good times."
,b1naryatr0phy,2012-06-25T13:21Z,"@Nailih why do you want a registered copy? the only difference is an extra tank graphic. if one does exist, it's in the bowels of some nerd's basement.

anyway, thnx kinglear>>
MOST. EPIC. GAME. EVER. PERIOD."
