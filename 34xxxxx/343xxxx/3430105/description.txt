Jermaine Jackson (Michael's brother) and Pia Zadora perform this 80s hit. The music video is hilarious. It has 80s hairstyles, bikers, weird looking sunglasses and badly choreographed fights. The video was included as the opening scene in Pia's equally hilarious film "Voyage of the Rock Aliens", although it has nothing to do with the film's story.
