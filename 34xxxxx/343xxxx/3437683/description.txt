          Nirvana: Kurt Cobain (vocals, acoustic guitar); Dave Grohl (vocals, bass, drums);    
          Krist Novoselic (guitar, accordion, bass). Additional personnel: Cris Kirkwood       
          (acoustic guitar, bass); Pat Smear, Curt Kirkwood (acoustic guitar); Lori Goldston   
          (cello). Recorded live at Sony Music Studios, New York, New York on November 18,     
          1993. UNPLUGGED IN NEW YORK is part of MTV's "Unplugged" series. UNPLUGGED IN NEW    
          YORK won a 1996 Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Performance. What is         
          ultimately so sad about Kurt Cobain taking his own life is that he was so giving to  
          others, constantly campaigning for the artists who influenced him. Cobain breathed   
          new life into the Raincoats' career (who thanked him on their latest EP), brought a  
          wider audience to Eugenius' pop genius, and proved there was grunge in Seattle before
          the '90s by covering a Wipers song on INCESTICIDE. The same reverential awe seeps    
          through every minute of the UNPLUGGED IN NEW YORK performance, released nearly a year
          after its recording in November 1993. Cobain's originals, from the wrenching "All    
          Apologies" to the numbing "Dumb," exempify his rare gift of saying so much with      
          deceptively simple chords and melodies. His choice of covers displays influences as  
          diverse as David Bowie and the Meat Puppets, and possibly most surprising,           
          Leadbelly--included is a ferocious version of "Where Did You Sleep Last Night?

                 HHI does not express an opinion either way with regard to the quality         
                 of the band etc. We hope you enjoy the music whatever it is!
