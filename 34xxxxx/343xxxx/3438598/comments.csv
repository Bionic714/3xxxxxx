,Sunduc,2007-07-15T23:25Z,"128 kbit is not enough for this album. I have it on LP as well, and the reduction of sound quality was horrendous! The sound of clear water on the LP really sounds canned on the rip.

I'd like to say thanks for the rip. By all means. Thanks. But feedback is none the less due, and 128 kbit simply sells this album short. Very short."
,Sunduc,2007-07-15T23:31Z,"Dunno why I said 128 above ... maybe a standard complaint mode of mine ... anyway, this album is very demanding with lots going on at the high frequencies (water, structured white noise etc), so 320 or lossless would probably be right and necessary."
