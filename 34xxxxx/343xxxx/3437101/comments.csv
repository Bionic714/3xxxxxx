,Lutzu,2006-03-05T14:48Z,"god, it's easy people, now listen here: 
1)first you download the files, 
2)then you rename the files as followed:
add-hard.001    to      add-hard.rar
add-hard.002    to      add-hard.r00
add-hard.003    to      add-hard.r01
add-hard.004    to      add-hard.r02
.                      .        .
.                      .        .
.                      .        .
add-hard.030    to      add-hard.r29

3)use winrar, or winace , or another packer that supports .rar files to unpack the game

4)run the game

was that explicit enough for you
tell me if something goes wrong"

So far so good. but then when it goes to the meny inside the game, it turns black on the screen. I hear the music and everything, but the screen is still black. Any idea of why? And soultion?"
