,alephnull,2006-02-17T09:06Z,yup - this is season 4
,daaaniel,2006-02-23T20:15Z,"This is VOLUME 4, not Season 4. This is season 3"
,daaaniel,2006-02-24T16:36Z,"BTW the rips are kick-ass. And the ""T-Shirt of the Dead"" episode is probably the best one.. That and ""Dusty Gozongas"". Those moon-doods are funny too"
