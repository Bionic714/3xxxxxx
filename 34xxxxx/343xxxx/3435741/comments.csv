,animematt,2006-06-24T07:05Z,hey all. I need this one reseeded too! shouldnt take too long.
,OtakuCat89,2006-08-09T08:34Z,"Iam having a bit of trouble. After downloading it I get a message from windows saying

The system file is not suitable for running MS-DOS and microsoft windows applications

any clue how to fix this?"
,ChaosX19,2006-08-12T11:02Z,"plz start reseeding this one, i just found this site.
looks real good and looks like a cool torrent this one. Thx already"
,GrotesqueArachnid,2007-07-07T20:59Z,"OtakuCat, just open it in NotePad or something like it instead.
Works for me at least. :)"
,Amy McGregor,2007-08-26T00:06Z,This game does not work on my computer at all. Thats sad :(
,Emeo,2007-10-14T18:55Z,"seed, plz :)"
,Panruru,2008-06-23T15:03Z,"It made my computer crash... But my computer's a piece of crap anyways, so I don't know what to think. ^_^;"
,Panruru,2008-06-23T15:09Z,"Okay yeah, t'was just my crappy computer. Thanks for the upload!"
,Franardo,2008-07-23T19:46Z,"Plays fine for me, unless I'm missing out on awesome 10 bit sound, 

I'd really like to find PM 3 in english if anywon (heheh) would be kind enough to upload."
,Franardo,2008-07-23T20:09Z,"Well i found a few versions of pm 3, no telling if they are english but it is on a donation torrent site that coasts 5 bucks to enter, Id love to do it but I have no cards yet, if anyone is going for it out there make sure you bring it to the bay, I promise to seed long time."
,mr1black,2010-05-09T20:37Z,"@ Otakucat, amy, and others - use dosbox, an old dos emulator on modern machines, complete with on-the-fly manageable cpu speeds and other happy features..."
,Ammo8,2012-02-19T06:53Z,Am i the ONLY one who doesn't have sound?
,Amy McGregor,2012-07-12T13:54Z,"Hello! Works well for me except that I do not have any sound. Not a big deal, though, since this game does not have a lot to offer in that department anyway. But I only have 1 empty save-slot, slot 7. When I try to save over one of the other slots it gives me some kind of errormessage. How can I fix this? Thanks."
