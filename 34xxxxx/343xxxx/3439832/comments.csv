,spinloop,2006-03-01T13:53Z,Nice speeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeed... :}
,dholi_sat,2006-03-02T18:49Z,"Where do I get the PLP from???

Is it included I can't seem to see it."
,DMoberg,2006-03-02T21:04Z,jag hittar inte helelr någon PLP att kriva in? Var kan jag få tag i den? (Det fanns inte någon install.txt?)
,dholi_sat,2006-03-03T16:37Z,"Could you possible write that in english. I don't see no install.txt file. It does not let me install without the key for it.

Help please someone. Thanks."
,enchantress,2006-03-08T15:25Z,So where is install.txt file?
,jgg352,2006-03-14T08:26Z,"Guys, look in CD 1 to find the folder, it's not that hard.  Once you mount it or run the burned cd, explore the cd, open the crack folder, and the file install.txt is right there.  Intuition is the key to success sometimes."
,sycat,2006-03-19T17:42Z,"Hello TBE,

MAthworks has released Matlab 2006a, old version system that is 7.2 R15. Its a major update so if you have access to that software please distribute it?

Thank you"
,m02alber,2006-03-21T08:08Z,"I have big problems to unpack the files. 
By using WinRAR, I get the error message ""rorm701a.rar: The archive is either in unknown format or damaged"". 

What does it mean and what can I do to get it working? I really need Matlab asap..."
,kolyamsk,2006-03-21T23:13Z,"use daemon tools to mout image, dont use winrar!

,DENZIE,2006-04-12T06:51Z,"Hey,

does anyone know this download of matlab includes simulink? it is bundled or do you have to get it from somewhere else.."
,DENZIE,2006-04-13T02:38Z,"Artiom
Said that for me too, but then I filled in both fields above where u put in the PLP.
I set the company to""-""..try that"

,MOPKOBKA,2006-09-05T11:54Z,Matlab videos available here http://bitspyder.net/details.php?id=6600
,Carneira,2006-10-26T09:18Z,"This is weird..
I've downloaded the whole thing, but I didnt get rar-files, I got 2 files in each cd. Both opens with the vlc-player. I tried burning them to a dvd, but still they only open with vlc.

Not sure what to do to be able to unpack and burn them..."

,caressboy83,2006-11-15T23:08Z,"i have downloaded a whole thing, but not .rar files. there were only three folders included mr14sp3a BIN file and mr14sp3a.cue file. i'm newbie, so pls help me anyone!

,caressboy83,2006-11-16T16:01Z,"sry for bothering, i tried it w/ daemon tool and  it  works fine. thanks kolymsk!"
,princeblue,2006-12-10T01:57Z,"Hey

Thanks for your work! 
I just finish downloading, but how could I find PLP when I was asked to input in the first installation page. 
Thanks."
,princeblue,2006-12-10T01:58Z,"Cont. above

There is no crack dir in all folders i downloaded...odd... "
,princeblue,2006-12-10T02:06Z,"is there any possiblity to kill my previous two threads which made me an idiot here?:-p

thanks for ur work! i could stay at home for one more month instead of going school everday for running matlab there. good job kolyamsk!"
,purplestorm,2006-12-12T15:57Z,"Only the first CD can be installed!!

when i inserted the CD 2 or 3 and click 'OK' button as per the requirement of popping window,the installation program was down and never responded. 

it seems you have to choose 'Skip CD' button to go through the installation, anyone had this problem b4?knows how to solve it?thanks."
,motty12345,2007-01-29T16:13Z,what does this program do??? pleace answer 
,maetis,2007-02-02T01:19Z,This is very nice! THANKS!!! 
,maetis,2007-02-02T01:23Z,"MATLAB is a high-level language and interactive environment that enables you to perform computationally intensive tasks faster than with traditional programming languages such as C, C++ and Fortran. If you don't understand that, don't bother to download it."
,maetis,2007-02-03T00:14Z,I have installed the program (All 3 of the CD's) and it works FINE!!! Read the installation instructions and you will have no problems. Thanks again for this beautiful upload!!!
,18430,2007-02-04T17:07Z,"This torrent is fine! Major kudos to kolyamsk.

You need MagicISO to open the .bin/.cue files. Use MagicISO to extract the folders into another MATLAB/CD1/CD2/CD3 structure. Dont forget to look at the crack folder to copy/paste the PLP.

Then run setup.exe in the CD1 folder. When the installer needs another cd just click Browse and point it to the CD2 folder, then the CD 3 folder.

MANY, MANY THANKS!!!

NOTE: the download size is 1.44 GB but the folder size is only 1.25 GB after decompression w/ MagicISO."
,skeppstroll,2007-03-19T03:22Z,"Works perfect! 

Danke sjön"

LOL! That was the worst description of Matlab that I ever heard. I hope it's not an official one!! :D

Matlab is mostly a collection of several distinct packages that implement a bunch of useful technical operations such as algorithms in very diverse areas such as statistics, economics, signal processing, automatic control, fluid dynamics etc etc.  It contains a very vast amount of soundly implemented technical algorithms for anything that you can do with data. Analyze, model, synthesize. That is, pick your lego into pieces, understand how the lego pieces are arranged, and build something that arranges the pieces the way YOU like it!

There is also a great Simulation environment where you build your system using blocks and wires in a graphical user interface.

The basic blocks that you work with in Matlab would be matrices of various sizes and kinds and that is where the Mat in Matlab comes from.

You pretty much have to be an engineer, in some sense, to have any use for this.

Cheers!"
,Movie_Critic,2007-07-17T15:57Z,"Works GREAT.
One you start the ""setup.exe"" from CD1, put ur name and set the company name "" - "" (as suggested by DENZIE previously-thanks!!!), you'll find the PLP in a ""crack"" folder in CD1. Copy paste that and ure set....

THANKS A LOT TO ""kolyamsk"" and ""denzie""!!"
,Movie_Critic,2007-07-17T16:00Z,"Thanks again ""kolyamsk""... Awesome job."
,drerock,2007-08-29T19:02Z,does this contain control systems toolbox?
,oasisforever,2007-10-20T20:27Z,"works fine!
thanks a lot!"
,cic,2007-11-15T22:31Z,thanks for sharing!
