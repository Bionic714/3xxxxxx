The brainchild of Charlie Brooker and Chris Morris, Nathan Barley is their latest comedy assault on society; a satirical parody of the Hoxton-finned, style obsessed world of the new media. 
Nathan Barley is 26. He is a webmaster, guerrilla filmmaker, screenwriter, DJ and in his own words, a "self-facilitating media node". He is convinced he is the epitome of urban cool and therefore secretly terrified he might not be, which is why he reads Sugar Ape Magazine - his bible of cool. 

Episode 1: Baffled human wreck Dan Ashcroft (columnist on Sugar Ape) watches in horror as his world is over-run with 24 carat berks, led by a strutting, brainless cock-of-the-walk called Nathan Barley, who, distressingly, has designs on Dan's sister Claire.
