Hi all new listeners, I (The Sniffer) hope you will enjoy this
trance/psytrance/slowpsytrance album. This album and some more music can also be
found on my webpage http://www.snille.net If you have comments or any other
ideas that you would like to share, join my forum on http://www.snille.net/forum
Let me know! :)

This album is composed using Buzz (http://www.buzzmachines.com). Buzz is a free
modular software based synthesizer tracker. All you people who have used Noise
Tracker (Amiga), Pro Tracker (Amiga), Fast Tracker (PC) knows what a tracker
based system is.

Simply said, instead of a horizontal note scheme as in CuBase and many other
"normal" music composing systems, Buzz is built on patterns and a sequencer. All
patterns scrolls from top to bottom and you add the notes in this "vertical"
scrolling. Adding channels, machines and new patterns when composing... Once a
"tracker" always a "tracker"... :)

Contact me on my forum http://www.snille.net/forum if you have any questions
and/or comments.

Enjoy... /sNi
