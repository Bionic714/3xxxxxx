[b]Description/Info:[/b]

The post-grunge band Ignite follows the late '90s spirit of anger inspired punk rock thrash. Pop kids who worship the likes of KORN, Limp Bizkit, and Blink 182 will be pleased with this quartet's debut, A Place Called Home. Its gut-wrenching spit of churning percussive throws and spiraling guitar licks still make corporate modern punk music something to mosh to. Like their Orange County counterparts the Offspring, Ignite remain fiercely energetic throughout the entire 13 song set list, and elements of speed metal/grindcore can be heard on songs like "Veteran" and "In Moderation." The loaded cut "Pieter" gets frontman Zoli Teglas sounding like a fast paced version of Tool's Maynard James Keenan. But overall musical composition strays, lacking sound variation and quick, catchy guitar riffs only carry this record so far. Don't expect any call-to-arm, fist hailing anthems. Only originals such as Metallica, Suicidal Tendencies, and The Ramones can keep that spark alive. Sadly, Ignite cannot do the same.
