,Profoss,2006-01-18T15:12Z,"LOVE Dissection! And would really appreciate if you could upload some more? Dunno how many albums they've done, haven't really listened to'em for many years, but would like'em all if there are more.

Older In Flames albums as well as At the Gates would be appreciated too :D"
