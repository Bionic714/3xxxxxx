My son love this program, he sits on the couch in the morning screaming his commands at the TV (as only a 3 year old can), in English by the way, which I find to be most amusing since we are Norwegians!  I show off Storm (my Kid) to my friends, speaking to him in english.. and he answers correctly!  sweeeet....*smirkin*  
 ""oh.. havent YOUR kid learned to speak english YET?! Well, really! he must be almost 3! honestly!"""
