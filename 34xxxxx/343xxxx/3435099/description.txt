*******************************************************************************

John Dortmunder and his merry band of burglars are back for another go at their
own version of wealth distribution--the planned burglary of a fabulous art
collection from a semi-deserted penthouse apartment. Westlake offers several
detours along the way and four--perhaps five--interrelated plots, as well as a
boxcar load of quirky characters. William Dufris brings all his skills to this
Westlake entertainment. The main characters are from New York and New Jersy,
giving Dufris a chance to explore the heights of their accents. He makes each
main character a recognizable individual and creates memorable versions of the
cameo roles, which range from Club Med staffers to Florida bonefishermen. He
also handles women's voices expertly. All this while delivering a well-paced
narration.                     --AudioFile
