,ratinaz,2006-01-10T16:23Z,"you know the drill....feel free to connect, but I will kick and ban ppl every now and then.....this to have only 1 or 2 peer at 400K/s or more......this WILL get more 100% out there faster than 40 leechers at 4kbs......if you have 100%, respect to Mr India by continue seeding"
,ratinaz,2006-01-10T17:23Z,"true, mcseuser....there should be a few 100% on 410...lets hope they show up..."
,Son Of Mogh,2006-01-11T01:42Z,"Well thnx Deuce, and all the others seeding, both are going fine now."
,ratinaz,2006-01-11T08:04Z,"Galemann -> I dont give a fuck if ""people"" get the files. There is a core of 4-6 die hard fans here, you know who you are :), and as long as they get them I am satisfied......If this hadn´t been the last disc, I would have been close to go FTP instead and shared only with the nice guys here. Besides, wankhead, superseeding is slower than manually picking peers with above 600Kb/s.."
,galemann,2006-01-11T08:29Z,LOL.. Like i give a fuck.. Only want to share with a few hardcore ppl... Stupidest thing i ever heard... I just wanted to give you idiots a tip... I aint downloading this shit anyway so go fuck yourself for all i care...  haha..
,ratinaz,2006-01-11T08:43Z,And his true intelligence is revealed. Is anyone surprised?
,jaal,2006-01-11T08:56Z,"Thank you ratinaz and Mr India for this great time,the best time for some of us.It's almost sad that it's over.

,darkcell,2006-01-11T19:33Z,"Jag kan bara instämma i kören: Tack! Har kollat säsong 1 och 2 på skruttiga AVI:er, och det här är ju något helt annat. Har bara sett 301 än, jag tänker suga på den här karamellen läääänge. Tack till dig ratinaz, och förstås till mr India i kulisserna."

,Deuce7OS,2006-01-11T23:00Z,Peracer check your PM
,Kvaakku,2006-01-18T17:42Z,Would someone be kind enough to share 407 again? I have 408 twice and i really don't know how that happened but it would be nice to have the complete series. Looks like there are bunch of us who are stuck in about 41% (because some ppl with over 90% aren't sharing too kindly). Thx for anyone who can help.
,Son Of Mogh,2006-01-18T22:54Z,"Ok everyone, I have started downloading Farscape The Peacekeeper Wars from Niteshadow torrent site. Go there if you want your collection to be complete. I hope that someone will start sharing the bonus disc too though. http://www.niteshdw.net:8080/index.php"
,lothlann,2006-01-19T00:38Z,I can try that Kvaakku :-).
,traxen,2006-01-31T01:17Z,"harley, got your message today and left a post in the old thread."
,corbendallas,2006-02-01T04:59Z,Anyone seeding this? Pleeeeeeease?
,rernst,2008-11-12T05:33Z,"Forget all these 'untouched' torrents. I have a super high speed connection and have been waiting for days for this idiot to emerge and seed. He's probably sitting there and grinning while the rest of us try to download a single byte.

Haha, yes, he managed to waste my time."
