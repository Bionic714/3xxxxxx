              John Sandford - Silent Prey (Unabridged Audiobook)
*******************************************************************************




This streamlined thriller is a rematch for Minneapolis homicide cop Lucas Davenport
and the insane killer he caught in Sandford's earlier slasher novel, Eyes of Prey. 
After psychotic pathologist Dr. Mike Bekker escapes from a New York courthouse and 
begins a killing spree, NYPD Lt. Lily Rothenberg asks Davenport, her former lover, 
to come to Manhattan and help the investigation. Despite Bekker's ruined face 
(courtesy of an enraged Davenport), the killer eludes capture and the bodies keep 
piling up, each with the eyelids cut off so that Bekker could photograph his victims as they died. Rothenberg gives Davenport an additional, undercover assignment--to ferret out the "Robin Hoods," a clandestine police vigilante group responsible for perhaps three dozen deaths, one of which was that of a fellow cop who might have been onto them. Paired with possible Robin Hood Det. Barbara Fell, Davenport taunts Bekker in the media, hoping to goad him into a mistake, but the grisly murders continue. As the momentum gathers, readers will speed through the surprise twists and confrontations of the last chapters. Although the story never drags and Sandford delivers his usual punch, the devices in his winning formula are becoming familiar.
