,Point-man,2006-01-27T00:38Z,I can't get this to work. I get a gauge error and fs9 shuts down. Any ideas on what the problem is?
,card747,2006-01-28T08:09Z,Someone please upload Feelthere CRJ's the new generation
,NuKleus,2006-01-28T14:47Z,"@Point-man: is OK for me, can only suggest installing the A-10 again, if that fails you may have to re-install FS9 :("
,NightKast,2006-08-27T01:20Z,"Has this torrent become corrupt? After the plane loads, I get a flash of the cockpit and the screen turns black, then fs2004 crashes. "
,Kiwi66,2007-02-23T02:03Z,"If you have a crash to the desktop when you load the A-10.
Go into the Panel folder which is inside the Aerosoft A-10 aircraft folder and delete the -
 Aerosoft A-10 threat warning GAU File.
I had the same problem until i deleted this file, do we need it, who cares, it works, you gets what you pay for......"
