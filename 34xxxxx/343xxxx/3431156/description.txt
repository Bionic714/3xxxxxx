[b]Description/Info:[/b]

Remedy is a white rapper who is part of the Wu-Tang Clan crew (but not a member of the 

actual rap group). Born in 1972 as Ross Filler in Staten Island, NY, he began writing songs 

and poems at the age of seven, and by high school, was performing as a rapper at local 

shows. Filler (around this time known as Remedy) began recording demos at Northshore 

Soundworks, the home of such rap luminaries as EPMD, Das EFX, and Redman. After striking up 

a friendship with Wu-Tang Clan member RZA, Remedy's track "Never Again" (a track inspired by 

the rapper's Jewish roots and the holocaust) appeared on the hit Wu 1998 release, The Swarm. 

Remedy's debut album, The Genuine Article, appeared in April of 2001, produced entirely by 

the rapper himself and mixed by RZA. A year later, Code Red arrived in November, including a 

track that offered his personal viewpoint on the terrorist hijacking of September 11th, 

2001.
