Social Distortion playing through all their classics. They play through both Mommies Little Monster and Mainliner: Wreckage From The Past, leaving out only MAinliner. The video also includes bonus footage after the practice with a number of shows by numerous bands like Joan Jett, The Alley Cats, and The Cramps. The list goes on. This is a must have for any punk fan.

Enjoy!
