Well here is number 11 just bought it this morning, 1st Feb.  These really are a great series and I hope that you are all enjoying them.  

In case you are new to this it is a series of Dora games for 3 year old+ that is being sold every fortnight here in the UK.  

I have uploaded them all and they are all still active, though it is easy enough for me to kick start one again if we run out of seeders. 

Just do a search for Dora and you'll find #1 -6 in one torrent then the rest in single torrents.

Enjoy the peace while your wee one is playing and learning at the same time!
