,nikitalord,2006-02-02T19:52Z,"I got the same error, but solve it. Do this try to copy it in to a folder again and run it from the folder by clicking on autorun or main. If that dont work run it from cd of some reson I needed to start it one time from cd but after that it worked perfect from folder.  good luck"

,strider2004,2006-02-13T13:10Z,A thought !   I copied all these files to a 'new folder' on my 3 year old girls PC and just did a 'create shortcut' from 'main exe.' in each one and dragged the shortcut onto the desktop so she can just double click the one she wants to play.

I am seeding all 31 games again for a wee while - at least till we get some seeders.   

Please try to seed for a bit and keep these going.

Anyone stuck, P.M. me and I WILL seed."
