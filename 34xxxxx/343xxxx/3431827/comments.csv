,jonahx,2006-01-14T20:25Z,"think there should be someone administrating new torrents, deleting the ones that don't write any info about the movie.."
,DELI1,2006-01-14T20:49Z,"No subs. One more time, this is the ultra rare, unreleased directors cut.
"
,urbanriot,2006-01-15T00:06Z,PAL or NTSC?
,DELI1,2006-01-15T08:11Z,"Its PAL.

I recorded this from the VHS tape to DVD, because it was never officialy released. Print is timecoded. "
,Knakkerpak,2006-01-15T10:39Z,Too bad the timecode is not blurred.

,DELI1,2006-01-19T16:45Z,"Thanks tuttle, I didnt know that."
,DELI1,2006-01-20T19:22Z,"No problem My mission was to show people how good Woo's original version is. In my opinion, Hard Target is best pure action movie ever made in hollywood. If you have some time, or people who had also downloaded this torrent, please visit this forum and write short (or long) review of the directors cut. Thanks.
