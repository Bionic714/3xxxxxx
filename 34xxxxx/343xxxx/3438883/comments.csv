,nutgraph,2006-09-11T13:41Z,"Any way of getting an older version somewhere?  The version you download is the latest beta (currently version 2.60b4) and some servers won't run betas, so you can't join them.  I just need 2.60."
,mac_davis,2007-05-01T17:46Z,"Why do no servers appear? If it were a beta version that was very new, at least SOME servers would be there, no?"
