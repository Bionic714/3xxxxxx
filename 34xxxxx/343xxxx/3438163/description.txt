This is one of Shiina Ringo's albums. If you've heard her before, have an open mind, or like music at all in general, take a moment to download this one. Her lyrics are amazing and her vocal work is nothing short of stunning. This is my first torrent, and I'm going to do my best to seed it, but you guys have to help too. It's a same that no one's really heard of her in the states when she's such a beautiful artist. If you get the file, seed it, and if you like her music, try to donate to her. You'll learn it's well worth it.
