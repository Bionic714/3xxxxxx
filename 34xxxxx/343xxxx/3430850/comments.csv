,Brado,2006-02-24T22:29Z,"Thanks matey, great games.  I'd encourage u to upload 3 as well, I'm dying to play it again!"
,victorkwan23,2006-03-01T04:28Z,"I get this msg when i launch the setup. It says ""the parameter is incorrect"". Can someone tell me wats going on. Im running windows xp btw. Thx"
,humP,2006-04-10T23:21Z,"Thanks a lot, but original MOO doesn't have crack :( Anyone has it?"
,Skyl3lazer,2006-04-21T03:36Z,"It shouldn't need a crack, but you can find them online easily. As for III, I'm running low on hard drive space, so when I get a new comp I'll try to get it up."
,Demoneyed_Kyo,2006-05-01T18:56Z,"I'm eager to get it...
but i heard bad critics about it...
that said its almost the same game as II, just with better grafics.
but for me thats more than enough, i still love II and perfectet my tactics :P + graphics = great^^"
,skoobydubie,2006-12-19T05:14Z,MOO3 is already up. but don't bother 'playing' it. Its automated to the point where all you do is click next turn. such a sad end to a great game. i made it to turn 70 doing nothing but clicking next turn. i got lucky and convinced the store to take it back. save your hd and bandwidth for something more stimulating.
,hddscanner,2007-03-13T13:43Z,Seed! :D
,qev,2008-03-29T03:28Z,"MOO3 in its original state is an unfinished abortion of a game, but the fan-made patches and mods have actually made it playable, even fun.  Check out the official MOO3 forums."
,ArrieS,2008-08-02T23:00Z,How do I get this to work with vista?  Dos prompt says I need EMS memory but when I setup the properties to either auto ems or the amount it asks for it still doesn't work.
,ArrieS,2008-08-02T23:01Z,For Master of Orion 1.
,abbeygargoyle,2009-02-15T01:08Z,try dosbox. That is how I get it to work with minimal trouble.
,Dourig,2010-04-10T10:25Z,"I just downloaded your Master Of Orion 3 torrent and even I will say that it is a boring game... which is why im now downloading this one since Master of Orion 2 is what occupied my summer time as a kid.

,p00li3k3n,2010-10-04T12:59Z,How do you get this to work for windows 7?
,leechoid,2010-10-05T09:00Z,"This game will not run on Vista or Windows 7.

I have yet to get this to work. There are two methods of install:
INSTALL.EXE: The DOS installer.
SETUP.EXE: The Windows95 installer.

If using SETUP.EXE
After install the executable is ORION95.exe, a Windows 95 program. It expects DirectX 2.0. Running this on Win7 with DirectX 11 fails to run, even in compatability mode for Win95. Out of the box the installed copy of the game can't find DPLAY.DLL. If you download it and drop it in the game dir, the game will run and you can hear music, but can't see anything, the graphics don't draw. Also tried on Vista, same deal.

If using INSTALL.EXE
The installer will fail to run in windows saying ""This system does not support fullscreen mode. Press 'close' to terminate"". There is no easy or workaround I have found for this, and from what I have read none exists.

If running INSTALL.EXE from within DOSBOX, the following message is shown:
""Message #1 in jimtext.lbx too long.""

I will post instructions if I get it working."
,_kemania_,2011-12-01T12:25Z,"Thanks for the upload, but I can't get it to work.

I'm running on XP, ran the unpacker for Orion 1 and then none of the .exe files have any effect apart from opening a DOS window and then closing it again.

Any thoughts?"
,Dimi_,2012-05-11T04:04Z,"All comments are old, but still, it might be of help to somebody.
MOO1 works perfectly with DOSBOX.
Its freeware. Find the latest ver online.
You ll need to play with the options. You can put 1440x1080 pixels, aspect ratio = true, scaler x3
the cpu around 30000 was ok and some other cool tuning. Ah, yep, if you put skip frames to 1,2,3 it might speed up the annoying moving ships when next turn is preparing, and all other similar useless frames.
It has full sound and it works on any pc, win 7 or whatever. You need decent cpu though, something after 2005.
I havent downloaded this torrent ... yet, so dont know if it is pached or not. Not talking about crack. There is a patch for MOO1 that fixes bugs, not working adv soil enrichment and some other stuff. The game is availble already freeware with this specific patch. Search online and you ll find it. But again no crack. There is a pic with the ships though in the folder. I dont use it anymore. Im guessing it ... :)
And btw never played 2 and 3 ...
I think its time ..."
