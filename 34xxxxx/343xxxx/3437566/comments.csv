,Tourniquest,2006-01-30T11:16Z,"Alec Guiness, huh? Is this anything like Star Wars then? ...Just kidding - I love the Ealing comedies. You wouldn't happen to have more of them by any chance?"
,bylgia,2006-02-02T15:54Z,Really outstanding! Thanks.
,Tourniquest,2006-02-06T22:48Z,"It's a French version of the film, but with the original English audio. The opening credits, a couple of signs and some handwriting is in French, but nothing that detracts from the enjoyment or understanding of the story."
