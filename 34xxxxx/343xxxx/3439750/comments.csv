,svareter42,2006-02-04T12:11Z,where do you find a REGISTARION KEY for this sim? - 188 downloads (someone must have the reg key) .please help (me) and the others.
,carter2241,2006-02-04T12:39Z,"I was Wondering Why cant we have ATC Simulator 2 On here or if not that , We have Radar Contact V4 Up"
,mickflip,2006-02-04T14:07Z,"Thanks you have uploaded Condor so fast, only I'm sad there is a virus in it or something. Maybe somebody else has Condor Soaring simulator?"
,mickflip,2006-02-04T14:11Z,Is it mayber possible to clean the file from the virus and upload it again? MAybe using all free anti virus software or Hitman pro?
,svareter42,2006-02-04T14:57Z,"What VIRUS are you babling about, i have installed it, without VIRUS problems.
I just need a REGISTRATION KEY -please help me, guide me"
,okpin,2006-02-04T19:06Z,"experimental_pilot: It's the best soaring simulator, if U don't agree, show me the better one. :)"
,mickflip,2006-02-04T20:46Z,"Condor is a nice soaring simulator! Maybe I'm goeing to buy it. But first i wanna try it with this torrent. I download it, my antivirus software (symatec antivirus) didn't find any  virus. Also when i start it, it works correct till you need to enter your registration key! So who got a key? Till then just download and seed it"
,ian-dyson,2006-02-04T20:53Z,"Hi Guys
I agree with mickflip. The source code is clean. The real problem is the serial code. You need a serial code to run the sim and this isn't supplied in the torrent. I have checked all of the keygen and serial sites today and nothing is available. Its not worth downloading the code without the key and I suspect that - that isn't going to arrive.
If I find one, I'll post it. Ian."
,aviator_dude,2006-02-05T01:23Z,NO. From my experience with this simulator and I have purchased it.   It is not compatible with Windows!!
,aviator_dude,2006-02-05T01:23Z,"From my experience with this simulator and I have purchased it.   It is not compatible with Windows!!  It will destroy your registry!!  I lost everything I had on my computer because of this simulator.  and that is the purchased version!!
Do not try any further to get this simulator.  Im just trying to help you out and save you the trouble bud."
,mickflip,2006-02-05T11:50Z,"Mmm aviation dude if its messed up, upload your Reg key, then you could help everybody, cause on my pc its working fine (only no reg key so no flying) I find out of you open your Condor map, and open the the deafault saved flightplans and select condor to open it with it, it starts up and than you can only host a game and there you can configurate your plane, weather, etc, but if you then launch the game it gives an error when its almost done with loading. ''Error install.ini''"
,aviator_dude,2006-02-05T17:21Z,"If you want to pirate a Soaring Simulator - Go get this one - http://www.silentwings.no/home/  Its called ""Silent Wings"" it can display GPS read outs from from your RL .igc files.  The Full version can be downloaded from the website.  We just need a key or crack.  What do you guys think?  "
,Irukandji,2006-02-05T20:33Z,"Well with everyone bitching all the time, i think that i will most likely stop posting anything at all... Freeware or payware... i only upload things that i think that people might like to have, whether you pay for it or not. I have tons ( nearly 123GB) of things that i have bought for FS2004 excluding the flight one stuff. But i think for now i will halt all uploads for a while"
,mickflip,2006-02-05T20:36Z,"Irukandji, everybody just want have a working condor ;) so everybody is bitching that he want a key. I thanks you very much for all the uploads, but without key or something has nobody something on it. Its not your fault, but thats why everybody is bitching :P"
,Irukandji,2006-02-05T22:13Z,Has anyone ever thought about actually searching for a key yourself. GOOGLE YAHOO EMULE LIMEWIRE. Dont let other people do all the work for you guys
,aviator_dude,2006-02-06T00:15Z,"So, what do you guys have to say about Silent Wings??"
,mickflip,2006-02-06T11:21Z,"Looks good, but we need indeed a reg or key, but it looks like not much people are interested in this kind of software, so there no cracks for it."
,aviator_dude,2006-02-06T15:12Z,"@Mickflip, GOOD!  This kind of software is for Real glider pilots. Not you flight sim loosers!"
,mickflip,2006-02-06T18:34Z,What do you mean? Im flightsim loser?
,aviator_dude,2006-02-06T21:21Z,Yes.  You all are.
,svareter42,2006-02-06T23:40Z,"please stop, NO need to argue.
-I'm a Glider Pilot, or sailplane pilot if you like it.
even if my name does not state that i am, DUDE !!
and it is WINTER TIME HERE, at my location (no updraft, or mountians here DAMM)
-so please KEY for this (drug)"
,aviator_dude,2006-02-07T01:26Z,"@svareter42,  ""updraft"" EH?  Glider pilots dont call ""thermals"" ""updrafts"".  Nice try! lol  ;-)  Pop Quiz - If your at 3000 feet, with a glide ratio of 30:1... Lets see if you can finish the question and answer it ;-)"
,card747,2006-02-07T06:42Z,"Anyone knows that, 30:1, For every 30 feet of vertical travel you will go down 1 foot vertically, thanks my understanding. I have my PPL, IFR cert, and Comm and Multi, and I still love flight sim. That make me a flight sim loser, "
,mickflip,2006-02-07T10:43Z,"Why are some people so unfriendly to each other, we're just trying to ask if somebody have a key or something, so we can all do what we want! I think this comments have to be used to help each other, not to slate people. So avaitor maybe your the best pilot in the world but we don't need any frumpy langueses of you. Just HELP each other with things.
(my English is by the way not very good)"
,ian-dyson,2006-02-07T23:28Z,"Hi Guys

It's a great pity that so much effort is being
wasted responding to a few marginals that are clearly trying to distract us from the main objective. 

These are the facts:

1 - Both Sims (Condor and SilentWings) are virus free;
2 - Both Sims require a serial key to activate them;
3 - Without the relevant codes, the downloads are worthless;
4 - Rather than waste valuable energy in distractive dialogue, lets find BOTH sets of keys and post them.

Ian"
,aviator_dude,2006-02-08T01:45Z,"How about you get a job and buy them?!?!
Guys I am a pirate aswell.  I understand pirating FS 2004 addons because they are way overpriced!
But Condor is made by two small developers.  If you want Condor to continue progressing and become better and better, then you need to support them with your money!!  The Condor Community is good community, please have some respect."
,ian-dyson,2006-02-08T07:38Z,"Aviator-Dude
Point taken. I have checked the background on this development and AD's quite right. It's a small group and pirating their software will compromise their product and future developments. Let's all take a step back and keep clear. Ian."
,mickflip,2006-02-08T16:35Z,"I agree with you aviator_dude but i just want to try condor out. I'm 17 years old and I can't just buy all things, but if i like te pirate one than i buy the condor licence! Than you can also fly online whats the most fun!"
,tc0fh,2006-02-09T10:24Z,"Run Condor, click Register and enter Serial: 111-YHL0-53NI

Enjoy!"
,mickflip,2006-02-09T10:59Z,Thanks tc0fh your my hero!!!
,aviator_dude,2006-02-09T14:20Z,"Congratulations tc0fh, you have a officially screwed the Condor Community!!   Bastard."
,tc0fh,2006-02-09T22:31Z,"No, I didn't!  I just passed the info found in a file on emule. At least the thread is going to die-out."
,aviator_dude,2006-02-10T02:10Z,How about you buy the key.  Then you will have no problems!
,flying_circus,2006-02-10T20:46Z,"What's the nonsense about the virus-containting/triggering key. It works without problems, I think it's just a deterrant for downloaders. "
,flying_circus,2006-02-10T22:23Z,"What is the talk about Condor messing up Windows? Is it another tactic to scare off potential downloaders, or a fact? Because I have run it and I encountered no problems.

Anybode with trouble?"
,mickflip,2006-02-11T14:50Z,"No problems @ all! It's running wonderfull, I think I'm going to buy the  legal version to support the developers! Smooth graphics, smooth fps and nice in combination with trackIR4 (you can only use 2 of 6 dofs)."
,svareter42,2006-02-13T20:34Z,"MY ASUS v9999 GFX-board, DIED while pLaying this game. ALL NATURAL CAUSES ;) -dont worry it happend before

,Shmuck,2006-03-05T09:50Z,It one thing to have the game but it's another to have the password as well. So what is it?
,Shmuck,2006-03-10T16:43Z,Is this the registration key that I would get even when I buy the game itself?
,Fufunka,2006-04-04T14:39Z,"Thanks for this release!

,G-BSCA,2006-04-11T13:44Z,"Hehehehe, I'm already with the optional, lol. 

Its a great game, ive ended up buying it, as its alot more rewarding to GR and Uros (programmers) than the likes of FS2004 to those Micrsosoft Money Munchers.

Seriously though, if you like the game and want to egt the best out of patch .0.7 and Multiplayer - Buy it!"
