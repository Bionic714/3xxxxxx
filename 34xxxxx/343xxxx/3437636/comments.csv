,Botch,2006-01-29T23:44Z,"I read a review of the book a couple of days ago, said it was mostly a load of muck-raking from an ultra-conservative with his own agenda :)"
,spaminator,2006-01-30T07:57Z,"That's a typical defense of ultra-liberals when they don't like what you have to say.  There have been no lawsuits over this book that I've heard of, since the contents are based on fact vs. accusations.  "
,McGrath79,2006-05-29T22:47Z,Seed please
,anders_and,2006-07-04T12:05Z,"so very american! Since there is no lawsuit it must be true ... 
and so naive: the private life of a ""thinker"" is proof for the truth of his statements. So, if Bush believed in what he says about Irak he'd be fighting there himself? "
,monocongo,2007-02-08T06:40Z,"This review is pretty fair: http://www.powells.com/review/2005_09_01.html

A good excerpt: ""In order to make a hypocrisy charge stick against liberals, you'd have to find someone promising one thing then doing another in a way that affects a significant number of people -- e.g., an anti-war candidate who funds a secret war in some far-off country. That's why liberals tend to focus more on George W. Bush's broken promise to be a uniter, or to be fiscally responsible than, say, his years as a problem drinker."""
