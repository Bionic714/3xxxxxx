Football Manager 2006 is a comprehensive soccer management simulation 
  offering a host of new features, including the ability for managers to 
  negotiate with their board of directors - not only for a better contract for
  themselves, but also for improved player wage budgets and increased transfer
  budgets or even stadium expansion. Be aware though, if you push too hard and
  don't reach the heights that the board specifies, you'll soon be looking for
  a new job. Half-time team talks add the ability to tell your players 
  individually or collectively exactly what you thought of their first half 
  performance, via the tactics screen. Will you be able to keep your players 
  motivated, or will you cause a collapse in the second half? Another welcome 
  feature is the ability to manage players on a personal level. Unhappy 
  players can cause huge morale problems for the whole squad and result in bad
  performances, so the new Player Interaction feature will help you to manage 
  your team more closely.
