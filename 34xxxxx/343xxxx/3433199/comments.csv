,SantiagoAtez,2006-01-19T15:52Z,"Have you guys had problems with the torrents getting corrupted sometime through the transfer, and having to start over?  This has happened to me lately, and often i can't finish a successfull torrent transfer until the 3rd time I try.  Perhaps it's my computer?  Or have you guys had the same luck?"
