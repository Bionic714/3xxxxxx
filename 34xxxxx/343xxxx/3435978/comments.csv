,homerjay,2006-01-26T23:29Z,"I've had no idea it wasn't prioritary.  I just can't read m4a and if I can't, there's probably a lot of people who can't.  

Besides, Ogg rocks ! :) peace"
,jonestowntea,2006-01-28T04:35Z,Ogg Vorbis is just the open source alternative. There isn't a huge difference between that and mp3 however the encoding in m4a beats out ogg vorbis by a lot. And as far as submit goes about talking about m4p there is no such thing there is however encrypted m4a. Oh by the way Ogg Vorbis can't hold as much information as a m4a can hence why m4a is much better.
