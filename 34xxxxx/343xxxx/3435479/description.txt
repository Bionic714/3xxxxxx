The "Lest We Forget" DVD was used as the source. I used double-pass 2500-3000kbps DiVX 5.2.1 for video and 192 CBR MP3 for audio. Each video is 80 in size.

I was absolutely fed up with the shitty quality of music video releases from these so-called "groups of the scene" (whose bright idea is it to reincode videos from shitty sources to low bitrate MPEGII and 128kbps mp3 resulting in 40 mb of an utter shit quality video, I will never know). This release is for people enjoying quality.
