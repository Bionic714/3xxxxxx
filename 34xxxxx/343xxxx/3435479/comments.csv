,sldsnake,2006-01-25T03:01Z,"where's ""Tainted Love""?"
,dnjago,2006-01-25T10:11Z,"Tainted Love was not avaible on the Lest We Forget DVD, that's why it's not included. I have also left out a few videos which were on the DVD (Lunchbox, Get Your Gunn and Cryptorchild) for the simple reason I thought they were shit."
,dnjago,2006-01-25T16:30Z,"brandon: it depends. As of right now, I am trying to get ahold of the DVD-R of ""Nine Inch Nails - And All That Could Have Been"" in order to make a proper high-quality 2CD (or perhaps even 3CD) dvdrip. There's a 1,02GB dvdrip of it going around, but as you might suspect, it's shit. I don't have anything else planned at the moment."
