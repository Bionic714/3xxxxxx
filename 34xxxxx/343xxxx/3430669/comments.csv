,Dichani,2006-11-25T23:33Z,Yes the Crack is there it is in the Damn file.  Load it into an image drive and explore the cd you will find a Folder named CRACK.  And it will be there.  
,johnstar,2007-02-04T10:34Z,"Thanx poznix, everything works perfect!
one question to any other users is, it wants to activate online is it ok to let it?"

,midulster,2007-04-10T00:34Z,"Thanks poznix

Professional 8 installed using the Keygen. But its now saying about online activation after 5 uses. Can I get round this?"
,SoCalGlocker,2007-07-01T19:32Z,"Torrent is complete, however keygen is bunk. I've tried over 100 different ones, all rejected by nuance. Good for only 5 uses."
,AMD freak,2007-07-29T00:44Z,"I got DNS 8 Pro (Eng).iso & keygen (by SSG 2005). This is the best voice reckognition software I have ever used!
My shit works 100% and passes online activation. I have been using it for about 1 year on my rig and this is ""Full Retail"" - no trial shit here (it's against my religion) lol

If interested....let me know!

The Freak has spoken"
,AMD freak,2007-08-03T19:31Z,"here is an ftp link to dload DNS9 (CD1.uif & CD2.uif)
You will need magicISO to extract/mount this UIF compressed image file.
