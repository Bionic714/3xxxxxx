do you have the ""quick and easy update"" instructions?  i can't remember where i saw them.

also, do you know of a wya to keep my zip codes and other settings straight even if i have to delete the zip?  is it possible to mention in the nfo if the old xml file should be deleted due to a change?

thanx"
,Barcodish,2006-02-03T19:22Z,"Just a quick question, when i navigate in up and down between My Music, My Videos etc there used to be pictures on right hand side, now there are no pictures appearing, just a black screen. Navigation works fine but pictures are missing. Anyone know what can be wrong? I tried deleting the E:/TDATA/0face008 folder, but didn't help. Thanks once again for this package, best there is:-)"
