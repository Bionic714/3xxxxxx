On 24 January 1984, Apple Computer introduced the very first Macintosh computer, the Macintosh 128K. It was the first personal computer which was widely distributed to include the Graphic User Interface (GUI). To advertise the computer, Apple produced a now world famous commercial, which it premiered in October of '83 at Apple's sales conference in Honolulu, Hawaii.

Part of the myth around this commercial is that it was only shown once, during the 1984 Super Bowl. This is partly true, as it was only show on national television once. However, on 15 December, 1983, a small TV station in Twin Falls, Idaho, aired the commercial, which made it eligible for the advertisement awards of 1983.

Included is the original commercial in QuickTime format (.mov). Length, 1 min; dimensions, 320 by 236; file size, 13.1 MB.
