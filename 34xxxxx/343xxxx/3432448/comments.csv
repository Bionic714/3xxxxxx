burn´d the game on a cd and istalled it, but whan i´m trying to start the game it´s say´s it´s wrong cd, can´t find any crack in the files."
,mange66,2006-01-17T22:23Z,"Reicher_t, the game works perfectly, i did find out how to do in your motocross madness 1 file,
so thx anywhay...."
,reichert_t,2006-01-18T18:01Z,"Mangaa66 - If you want to burn it to CD you have to use Alcohol 120% and set the ""datatype"" to ""Safedisc"" in the Burning Wizard options. MCM2 uses Safedisc 1.50.020"
,reichert_t,2006-01-18T18:03Z,"6) A note on Mounting: FYI Newbies - mounting an image makes your computer ""think"" that the image is an actual CD on an actual CD ROM drive  (virtual drive).  Once you mount, if you have XP with autoplay enabled the game will begin to install.  Otherwise you have to click on the image on the vitual drive located inside ""My 
Computer"".  Mounted images usually do NOT 
require a crack.

I hope this helps those who need it!

,reichert_t,2006-01-18T18:05Z,"3)  The best way to use an image file is to 
""MOUNT"" it on a virtual drive using Alcohol 120% (Daemon Tools will also do this)"

1)  Ok, go ahead and download and install 
Alcohol 120% if you don't already have it."

,Naxon_255,2006-09-16T13:55Z,"oh dear, another newbie, you must download a bit torrent client first, then download the torrent file (which is about 23 kb) and open it with the bt client.
it will work itself out once you do that.

i hope i don't have to explain the installment of the game."
