,xdragus,2006-03-12T01:05Z,The subtitles around 6 minutes near the end of CD1 are in the beginning CD2 - if there is already a fix please post it.
,xdragus,2006-03-12T01:21Z,Nevermind found the right ones at http://subtitles.images.o2.cz/d/71129/Azumi.html - just rename it properly ;)

,doodooperson,2008-03-19T01:51Z,"Xdragus, that link you provided is no longer working as far as when I checked it.  Here is a better link: http://www.allsubs.org/subs-download/azumi-cd-2-2003-xivd-giso/295166/
I tested it and it worked perfectly.  Also, for those of you confused about how to get the subtitles to work-- I found it helpful to download the VLC media player.  Then, you go to file>open file, and it has two slots-- one for the actual .avi file and the other for the .srt (subtitles)."
,doodooperson,2008-03-19T02:30Z,"I'm sorry, but I posted the comment without watching the entire second CD.  It looks like the subtitles only work for about the first 10 minutes, and then they disappear.  "
