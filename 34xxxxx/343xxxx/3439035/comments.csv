piss tits. what are you talkin about? this is his EP (which is clearly says it is) after Infinite but before Slim Shady LP... an EP is generally released before the full cd. 

LOOK WITH YOUR EYES. 

cock. "
,Shady925,2009-02-05T23:26Z,An EP is just an album composed of 10 and less tracks... an LP is more
,The_Redneck_Juggalo,2010-02-19T05:43Z,"The only problem Eminem had is he started caring about what everybody in the country thought instead of just what his music was about. Eminem used to be good. Back when he didnt care about what the industry had to say. When he started editing his songs just for radio play, is when he started to get shitty and stopped rappin about what he was good at. Eminem hasnt put out a decent album since The Eminem Show."
,The_Redneck_Juggalo,2010-02-19T05:44Z,But nonetheless thank you for this torrent. Im interested in listening to Eminem before he hit the mainstream.
,jolive,2012-07-02T10:59Z,Eminem likes boys
,jolive,2012-07-02T11:00Z,Which is why I'm listening to him.
