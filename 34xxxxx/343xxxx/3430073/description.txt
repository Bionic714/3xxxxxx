One of the excellent early films Buñuel made while in Mexico. He tells the story of an impoverished people, living a day to day existence, who are being forced out of their housing because their landlord  wants to build a new house on that site for himself and his mistress. The tenants refuse to leave peacefully, so the landlord upon the urging of Jurado gets an enforcer (Pedro), known as El Bruto, who works for him in his slaughterhouse, to get rid of the tenants' four ringleaders.
