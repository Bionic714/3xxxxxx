"I've Heard the Mermaids Singing" was, when it came out in 1987, by 100 international critics voted one of Canada's ten best films ever (but since then there has been a great many more fine Canadian movies). It was Patricia Rozema's debut as a feature writer/director. It's a bitter-sweet story of Polly who, among other things about her, gets a crush on her employer Gabrielle. When she finds out about Gabrielle's former lesbian relationship, she gets jealous and rather unhappy but she also manages to cultivate a few seeds within herself into budding flowers.

Full, uncompressed dvd 9 (NTSC). It's 5050 MBs. By compressing it to one dvd 5 you'll lose only circa 5 per cent of the data. Might be worth considering.
