,lynott49,2006-02-02T20:11Z,"Hi!

This is real LIZZY and real RARE!
Two apperances from France. One is Live from a concert broadcastet by Houby Houba and the other one are some songs of the Chinatown CD mimed. But it is really great, especially the Live Songs are cool, I have never seen PRESSURE WILL BLOW live before.
