,jaybird007,2006-01-27T06:42Z,Can someone post the info for how to switch it to English for those of us who DLed it from somewhere else?
,mbeau,2006-01-27T09:20Z,Look at the comment I made. Read the readme.txt. It explains how!!
,mbeau,2006-01-27T14:29Z,"Sorry, I read your comment at 2 in the morning and I was pretty tired...

1) Install and run the application.

2) Run regedit (or regedit32 for Windows 2000, in the system32 directory).

3) Locate the KCOH (or similar, running from memory here) directory under Software/Cryptic

4) Change the Locale value to 0

5) Now modify the security permission for the KCOH directory and remove or deny all permissions except ""Read""

Now run the app and it should run in English "
,Lord Quintus,2006-02-15T03:11Z,"The instructions are a tad unclear. I did what I think I'm supposed to, but it's still in Korean."
,mbeau,2006-02-23T18:51Z,Did you save the settings in your Registry before you closed the editor?? There's not much else I can say. 
,Caern,2006-02-24T03:01Z,How do you change the local value?  There's nothing in regedit that's labeled local value.
,mbeau,2006-02-27T22:40Z,I will try uninstalling it and re-installing it at home.
,mbeau,2006-02-28T00:49Z,"I tried again at home. I removed it and re-installed it, and it kept the language as english. All I can say is to look through your registry entries for Cryptic and NCSoft and make sure that the locale setting is set to 0. Sorry I can't be more help."
,Zero_Hawk,2006-03-18T06:54Z,"Seed, please."
,aiarhynn,2006-03-19T06:42Z,"What in heck's name is the locale setting?!  Where do I find it, and how do I edit it?  Every time I try to use the program I get error messages, gibberish, and a big black box of nothingness.

Would find step by step, rescue the not-so computer savvy person, intructions very helpful, PLEASE!"
,aiarhynn,2006-03-20T04:41Z,"found the locale.  edited as directed.  Program now starts and appears to load, but then it takes over the entire screen (Which I know is normal for a game to do), and NOTHING happens.  It just sits there."
,defektedtoy,2006-04-06T19:40Z,database error
,defektedtoy,2006-04-06T19:45Z,"tpb.org keeps messing up, i am trying to post the info on how to make the program in english.

all i get is ""database error"" and it wont let me post."
,defektedtoy,2006-04-06T19:48Z,"Install the software. The buttons will be in Korean, but they probably say pretty much what you think they say.

Right-click the ""COH Character Creator"" icon and select the ""Shortcut"" tab."
,defektedtoy,2006-04-06T19:48Z,"
In the ""Target"" text box, add the parameter "" -windowed"" to the end of the command line. So if the ""Target"" originally said

""C:GamesCOH Character CreatorCharacterCreator.exe""
"
,defektedtoy,2006-04-06T19:49Z,"it would now say

""C:GamesCOH Character CreatorCharacterCreator.exe"" -windowed

Under ""Compatibility mode"", check the ""Run this program in compatibility mode for"" checkbox, and select ""Windows 98 / Windows ME"".
"
,defektedtoy,2006-04-06T19:50Z,"Run the program once.

Exit the program.

Run regedt32 (or your preferred registry editor)."
,defektedtoy,2006-04-06T19:51Z,"Go to registry key 
HKEY_CURRENT_USERSoftwareCrypticKRCOH
Change the locale value to 1.
Right-click the KRCOH key.
Select ""permissions"".
Click ""Advanced""."
,defektedtoy,2006-04-06T19:53Z,"Un-check the box labeled ""Inherit from parent..."". Click ""Add"". Type ""Everyone"" in the ""Enter the object name"" box."
,defektedtoy,2006-04-06T19:54Z,"Click ""Okay"".
Double-click the ""Everyone"" entry. Check only ""Allow Read Control"". Click ""Okay"", ""Okay"", ""Okay"". Close the registry editor.
The program should now display in English.

sorry about posting the instructions all douchry, but piratebay wouldnt let me post it in a regular way for some reason. i hope it helps!"
,MaR7oFiLa,2006-11-13T21:45Z,can you upload the game
,beardown50,2006-11-26T04:01Z,I really want this game! Gonna buy it in about a week. It's a subscription game so I don't think you could get this for free and play it anyway!
,Rywern,2007-01-16T02:01Z,"skulle behĂśvas en seeder hĂ¤r =), tack!
------------------------------------------------------------------------
we could need a seeder here, please"
,zabadoh,2007-01-21T11:35Z,We could really use a seeder for this!!!
,Xaratane,2007-04-15T13:56Z,Seed please ^^
,antygravity,2007-06-10T16:16Z,Excuse me for the stupid question but if there s a coh character creator shouldnt it be a cov character creator
,arkx,2007-06-20T06:40Z,hay sorta dumb qustion but for all the games like wow and city of heroes games is there a crack or somthing that lets u play the game without haveing to pay ?? or is it even possible to get that?
,Ryver,2007-07-16T14:22Z,"Could really use a seed for this.

arkx: No. No, there isn't WoW has 50 million ways of stopping piracy, and the long and the short of it is that you can install WoW however you like (even from a burned copy), but you need the Auth.Key from a retail package to create an account at all. I imagine City of Heroes is similar."
,Daelon,2008-01-25T19:25Z,"anyone seeding ?

i stucked at 84.5%...

please "
,Daelon,2008-01-26T08:04Z,"what are the system requirements ?

i installed it, changed the registry, then run the program, but it's always freezes out after a few minutes.
the pictures breaks into pieces, and then the pc do not respond to any command.

i have a 3GB Pentium-4, 1GB RAM and NVIDIA GeForce4 Ti 4200 video card.

any idea ?"
,Daelon,2008-02-01T10:47Z,"i've done it. 
it works, but only if i don't use the win98 compatible mode, and switch off the screensaver"
,DarthVesper,2008-07-26T10:50Z,"The only way to play CoH/CoV for free is to download the free trial, unfortunately. 

I play the game, avidly, and they recently cracked down HARDCORE on spammers and people trying to play for free. 

As far as if you are interested in playing the game:

Game Time Cards are the best way to go, especially if you don't intend on living on the game, I.E. you have a life outside of your computer, lol. 

Buying Time through the site will automatically bill your credit card, or bank account every month, until you cancel it.

To get the 30 day free time it offers on the game package, you have to have a time card to go with it. 

Stupid FYI, but hopefully that clears some of the questions needing answers. 

BITCHIN COOL Torrent by the way. Too bad it's not current with Issue 12, but all the important things are there :) "
,Gryffinguy,2009-07-29T08:29Z,Why can't I see my mouse cursor when using the tool? Is that part of the download or do I need to adjust something?
,outlawguy89,2009-08-13T21:43Z,"You can play games like WoW, and I imagine COH/COV, for free by using private servers.  It's all free, I'm playing WoW with a full game copy without paying a cent.  You're not playing on Blizzard's servers, but a ""private"" server hosted by a third-party.  Against their rules, but this is TPB, who cares about copyright, right?"
,BobaFett2040,2011-06-25T23:36Z,"defektedtoy's guide works. Only one thing missing. I use Windows 7 Professional. When you're modifying the permissions for the registry entry, remove all users EXCEPT the following:
""Everyone""
""RESTRICTED""
Both of those should be Read only. The program should now be in english."
