,Rhum_Keeper,2007-07-16T08:09Z,"This is the CD Version. Chesky also recorded at 96/24 but this was published and is available om a DVD. It is not a DVD Audio. It is is DVD Video without pitctures, except menu and still pictures, 1 per song.

53 minutes of music at 96/24 do not fit into 612.07 MiB. 

But, beein a Chesky and a great arttist is is worth to have."
