[T],Peterq,2006-01-28T17:19Z,PS - I haven't uploaded Audition 2 as it's been posted already though I can't verify the quality of the release!
[T],Peterq,2006-01-28T17:53Z,"There is a crack for the ""tryout"" version floating around. I'm not sure it will work with the full-retail.

[T],Peterq,2006-01-28T17:55Z,As soon as I have the keygens for the Production Studio I will upload.
,ressan,2006-01-28T18:00Z,"Thanks for the retail version , however, would you please seed it !!!"
,kss,2006-01-28T18:01Z,thanks for your effort!!!!
,absent,2006-01-28T18:53Z,"The retail iso version I have from Usenet doesn't let you install without a serial number, there is no trial option. I would have thought this'd be the same if it's retail too."
,absent,2006-01-28T18:54Z,"The same goes for all new Adobe, no serial no install, no trials on the retail versions."
