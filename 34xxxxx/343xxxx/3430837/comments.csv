,blackbrain,2006-01-13T19:58Z,no seed since one day :(
,angelica_wl,2006-01-13T23:26Z,"I know, been stuck at 76,7 for ages... Could some one seed???"
,angelus-cantus,2006-01-24T18:08Z,please seed!!! I've been looking for this film for ages!!
,Josse90girl,2006-05-02T16:29Z,"Please,seed! I really want to see this movie!"
,ClusterLizard,2006-09-23T08:33Z,"It would be lovely to have a seed for this. I'll seed it awhile too, if I ever get it. "
,Shalimar,2007-02-26T11:20Z,"hmm interesting how the server shows a seeder.. on and off... but it would appear NONE of us can ever connect even when they are supposedly there...

come on atsfan.. FINISH this dammit."
,plenary,2007-04-13T17:27Z,Please seed this! There's loads of us stuck at 76.friggin7%. I can seed once I have it all!
,Shalimar,2007-04-27T00:40Z,"I'd say it's safe to assume to DELETE this since atsfan has never finished seeding this or any other torrent he up'd for that matter...  and this is just a wast  of time/bandwidth.

Anyone actually have the full DVD and can actually upload it??"
,opengirl,2008-04-03T03:20Z,"Does someone actually have all of this movie?  It says there is one seeder, but it appears that only about 77% of ths torrent is available.  Is there another upload of it somewhere?"
,highlander777,2008-04-22T14:50Z,"Hey atsfan,

Any chance of SEEDING this torrent? There are 20+ people sitting at 76.7%. Thanks.
"
,Bouillie,2008-08-21T11:51Z,"Please can you reseed, i don't have the complete file...
Thanks!"
