The video and sound quality leave something to be desired, but the point is not to watch but to listen and to HEAR what Chomsky says.
To those too busy bickering, you waste your effort. 
Do not lower your standards trying to convince fools. Instead find those with the intelligence and will to question, a desire to change, and provide energy and resource for each other.
Increase the Knowledge!!"
