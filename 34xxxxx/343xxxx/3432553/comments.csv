,jjadmin,2007-05-21T17:31Z,"I got this downloaded and installed. Copied the files to a CD, but everytime I try and run(even from the CD) it asks me to insert the CD. What am I doing wrong??"
,MM2007,2007-05-23T22:03Z,"I remember playing this a long time ago.  On a whim I searched it out here and was delighted to find it.

This game may be old but it has always been a favorite of mine.  Great graphics, gameplay, storyline, etc.

Clean and fast torrent.  Everything worked beautifully!  (I used DAEMON tools to mount the MDF file - that's for the person who is having problems).

Thanks to this kick-ass torrent I'll be flying high as Nathan Zachary again!  Also, this torrent seems very appropriate for the site.

I'll be seeding this for at least a few weeks.  I hope others take advantage of this great torrent."

,gotcha84,2008-10-06T11:20Z,"I'm seeding right now but HOW DO I GET THIS TO WORK?

I have the ISO mounted onto Daemon Tools and I extracted it using Virtual CloneDrive. I installed the game by running the setup and when I click on the Desktop Icon for it to play, it asks for a CD! Yes, I still have the ISO mounted onto Daemon Tools, but it still asks for a CD!

What to do? Replies will be highly appreciated. Was totally psyched out to play this game. HELP!
(PS: I'm still seeding)"
,gotcha84,2008-10-06T11:48Z,"EDIT: I meant, I tried mounting it using both Virtual CloneDrive and Daemon Tools,  but it kept asking for a CD... What to do?"

,miscom,2009-02-23T07:03Z,"will this work with vista?? =|
I love this game, but I have managed to loose the cd. If this works with vista my week is saved :D"
,SeattleEse,2009-03-20T11:30Z,"Awesome! had no idea this was for pc!  Google .mdf, it's alcohol, daemon tools, power iso or magic iso or something.

Go to gamecopyworld or megagames and search for a fixed exe file if it asks for cd."
,QWBON,2009-06-15T23:05Z,The game hangs on the splash screen for me. Anyone else having the same problem?

,Anthony817,2009-09-12T00:41Z,"Man, never knew it was out on PC either.  I played this in the arcades at a Put Put golf and games, and man, was it the best damn arcade experiance I ever had seriously! The Arcade had a spherical cockpit simmilar to the strange egg cocoon chairs you see, and the front was opened to a big screen tv, and the joystick and throttle were awesome!

If I had the cash I would want to buy that Arcade cabnet cause the cockpit moved and tilted like an Aircraft simulator at Boeing!

If I remember correctly tha game took 6 guarters, and cost $1.50 per play USD haha, it was fucking worth it tho guys. That was like back in 2002 or so also."
,Anthony817,2009-09-12T00:44Z,"Oh and ya, I,m getting round 250kbs! Woot thanks mates, really great job seeding. I hope every dude does the same and seeds it for future players. If this works online I will see you guys there!"
