So if you have trouble playing this .rm post a comment and I will up that as well, but this .rm worked fine for me and is much better quality.."
,Drexon,2006-01-20T17:40Z,"ZinZaH> You're a sick man for sharing this snuff film, wich is actually snuff film after snuff film of US soldiers getting snipered in Iraq. I'm gonna suggest this torrent be removed, it's just that sick."
,ZinZaH,2006-01-20T22:06Z,"I am no muslim, and this is not america, FYI.

There are many videos around the net (and tv has shown em too) of u.s. bombing the be'jesus of regular ppl, napalming and phosphoring them.. 

This is freedom of expression.."
,ZinZaH,2006-01-20T22:46Z,"In fact, according to international law, usa's attack to iraq was unjustified and against all international law by attacking the sovereignity of this country.. So basically these people are defending their country against illegal occupation. Just like us finnish ppl once stood up against the russians.."
,383a,2006-01-23T00:40Z, You're a very very sick man for sharing this shit

,Sgt.Crack-Ho,2006-02-01T17:39Z,"This is a sniper shooting (what is for him) enemy soldiers. That is morally defendable, as opposed to an airforce bombing civilians."
