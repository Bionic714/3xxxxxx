The proses of homebrewing presented here got lots of wrong information and bad tips.

To mention some:
-He boils the grains (this wil extract some bitter unplesant flavours)
-He use ice to cool the worth (Ice is not desinfected and can infect your beer. One alternative is to put the pot in running cold water)
-After you pitch the yeast you need to desolve some O2 in th worth, one way is to shake the bucket for 5min.
-Yeast can eat regular suger without splitting it, but you need to boil it to disinfect it.

If your intrested in brewing, search fore homebrewclubs/forums in your country or try www.basicbrewing.com"
