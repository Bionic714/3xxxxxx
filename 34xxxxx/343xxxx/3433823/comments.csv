,simpleton_12345678,2008-06-16T22:13Z,"FYI: I downloaded this torrent onto a windows machine and scanned it for viruses. It was flagged for trojans. I moved the .zip file to a test machine with a windows OS. I unzipped the file and opened the .txt files. Within seconds 17Pholmes.exe appeared, Yazzle12310xxx.exe appeared, and snapsnet.exe appeared. goodluck!"
