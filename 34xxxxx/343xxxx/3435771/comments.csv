,twistedowns,2008-01-14T15:13Z,if you are gonna upload a game atleast upload the correct files and everything that goes along with it... i have this game and have all the stuff with it too and no way in hell its only 337.65 megabytes :| is fake bullshit like this makes people hate downloading good games.. atleast you copied some of the correct review info probably from google.. anyways this file is probably loaded with viri... the real file is almost 800 megs
,tbunny,2008-02-20T17:19Z,"if you think it's loaded with viruses, just virus check it once downloaded.

and if one poster says it works fine, apart from the movies, and another claims that it's fake because the *real* game has another 500MB or so, then...?


...that's right!  the movies have been taken out to save space! :O"
,Semigall,2008-04-15T10:51Z,"No movies ?

Ok, then i'll better dl that other 700mb version..."

,apelhitam,2010-02-24T03:11Z,"my internet is so slow, that its hard to believe thats its a 100mbps wireless connection (usually it runs at 10 kbps), and i waited a total of 70 h waiting for this torrent to finish, only to find out that its incompatible w windows vista D"":"
,apelhitam,2010-02-24T03:13Z,"it says incompatible pixel bit and ""cannot find basmod file""
so im left with a light grey colored 'thing' which i suppose is the setup menu on my desktop.
any pointers, except for using a different system?"
