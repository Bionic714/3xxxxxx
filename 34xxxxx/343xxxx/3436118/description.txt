We are four guys and a girl who mix our favourite heavy music from the seventies with todays styles. We firmly believe in playing our instruments - no cheating, sampling, computers or drum machines! We love time changes, but try not to destroy the overall flow in the music with too many of them. We also believe in making lyrics that have a content as well as a bit of poetry! We are unsigned and wouldn't want it any other way!

We actually began playing in 1979 as Motive - thus the claim to be the original! - but drifted apart into other bands. Torben Deen has released records with Mirage, Reality Bites and Arctic, Mogens has released records with Mirage and Third Stone from the Sun, Leif and Soren has released a single with Down Payment. Since we were all out of our bands it felt right to start Motive again and get down to playing the music we love. So here it is!
