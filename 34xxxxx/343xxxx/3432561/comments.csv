Looks like another non 1.5'er then, as do most games now days :("

,jimsta10,2006-01-20T05:21Z,"How do you play other games on Emu? firstly you need FW 1.5, the download games that will work on FW 1.5. use the homebrew loaders to start the games. go to http://psp-spot.com/."
,spwans_freaky_ch,2006-01-23T11:52Z,"Yeah alk_3 is right this game won't work on any of the current emu's for 1.5 as of date (Jan 23, 2006) a good site to check this on is http://pspiso.nachtvuur.nl/ it show's which loaders will run which games... give it some time maybe 2.6 will get cracked soon (6) hehehe"

,inouba,2007-01-26T07:28Z,does it work on 3.03 Ob ?
,PspLoverX,2007-02-03T05:55Z,"inouba, yes it probably does, but if you got 3.03 OE-B, why don't you just upgrade to 3.03 OE-C?? It's much better.

Oh, and I found this movie for PSP earlier today, http://btmon.com/Video/Unsorted/PSP-Movie_911_Mysteries_2006.torrent
