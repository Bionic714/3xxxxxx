PQ: Practical Intelligence Quotient is designed to challenge deep-thinking gamers with a series of 100 logic puzzles, for spatially minded PSP gamers (and M.C, Escher fans). Most puzzles are set in a 3D space where player must rearrange boxes to open passageways, build stairs, avoid laser scanners, and clear a path to the exit. Gamers who are close to a wireless access point can use the Internet to check their high scores against those of other players from around the world.
