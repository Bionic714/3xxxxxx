A request for "Lucy".  This is an Italian film dubbed over in English.  There were no subs, and no Italian soundtrack om the DVD.

This is a pretty good exploitation flick...if you liked "Ilsa, She Wolf of the SS" you just might like this. ;)

I had to deinterlace this one, that is why there is a weird framerate.

Mini Plot:

This is one of many so called Video Nasties about fictionalized World War 2 Nazi POW camp atrocities. A beautiful, nefarious senior female SS officer/doctor (Magall) creates a genetic, mutant human Beast (half man/half beast). The Beast is a rapacious, squat, mongoloid sex fiend which she uses to torture and molest female prisoners while the Nazis watch. The vertically challenged beast is kept on a diet of mega-aphrodisiacs. There is plenty of sadistic titillations, gore and nudity in this Nazi sub-genre exploitation flick.
