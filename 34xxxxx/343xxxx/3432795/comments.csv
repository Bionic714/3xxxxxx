,jamieg420,2008-01-28T07:42Z,"was there a ""rest of this series""?  if so, i'd like to have it, too.

,giggedyguy,2008-07-17T07:08Z,How about telling us if this is the US version or the British version. I prefer the main actor in the US version a thousand times over.
,DismalCanuck,2008-10-15T17:33Z,this series just started in america...so relax and be patient
,22278L,2009-02-17T07:18Z,This is the UK version. Does anyone have the rest of the rest of the season? Thanks a lot!
,ohverture,2009-03-04T06:12Z,"God no, I pray this is the UK version. Why don't the US just air the original instead of thinking they can make it better and then destroying it utterly?"
,ergabo,2009-08-05T21:00Z,THX
