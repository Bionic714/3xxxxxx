In response to problems with my other upload for LOMAC GOLD, this is a redone image of disk 2, with all the bells and whistles Alcohol 120% has to offer, and left with the original disk name, read at 4X (pretty much the same as the other only done slower). There is nothing more I can or will do, so for those of you with problems with the iamge, either figure it out or hope for a fixed exe. I haven't done any testing with any of the images simply because I don't have the time. If you don't want to download any part of my other upload of LOMAC, you can use any copy of disk 1 out there, just install the original, then install Flaming Cliffs (you will use the Flaming Cliffs disk to run the game). For bypassing StarForce, there are several programs included with the game UFO: Aftershock, which also has the only fixed exe crack I know of for a StarForce protected game.
