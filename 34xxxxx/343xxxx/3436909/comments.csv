,TheProphetD,2006-01-28T12:14Z,Thanks you a lot! I really hope it will work.
,DFP,2006-01-29T21:17Z,can anyone confirm that this works?
,tungxxx,2006-01-30T03:19Z,"""make the image w/ RMPS in Alcohol"", do you mean we MUST have the original disc to make a .MDS that works? or we can made this .MDS from our image (to another image w/ RMPS)?"
,Zack2k,2006-01-30T05:28Z,Yeah it would have to be the original disc. Unless you can find an MDS file somewhere that is specifically for Lockon Gold version (not the Russian or FC standalone). If you did then you could probably use that one. There's actually a Russian version floating around that apparently works but I haven't been able to get a hold of it. File names are lockonflcl.mdf/mds for that one.
,DFP,2006-01-30T14:56Z,"cant run here either, bloody starforce.

has anyone tried downloading the download version of the game from emule and trying the registry key that's available there too?"
,tungxxx,2006-01-30T16:32Z,"omfg, M33S3 doesnt want to help us anymore. M33S3, we beg you to make an image following Zack2k's instructions, we only need a MDS made w/  RMPS enabled, a tiny file that u can upload on a free host. Can u?"
,ResonanceX2,2006-02-12T11:25Z,Still doesn't work... I hope someone could make a working image (And test it before uploading!)
,allanman,2006-02-16T22:55Z,starforce asks for a disc key. anyone got one?
,MrSoul,2006-04-20T23:14Z,seeda? någon? snälla?
,Ulster-Podge,2006-05-25T12:45Z,Has there been any progress on cracking this one?
,Kaldun,2006-07-22T15:37Z,"Hey, someody, how can we crack this? Is it possible  yet. If it is straforce ver 3.xx then it is unpossible yet. M33S3, you probably know something if you seeded it?"
,colinroyce,2006-08-05T23:25Z,"I havent downloaded yet, but I think the game came out in 2003, I think I could put everyones mind at ease, try running it under win2000 compatability mode, that just might do the trick.
Just check the properties of the shortcut and alter compatability mode."

If it still doesn't work try :

1...Install lomac (lock on moder air combat)
* Install ALL the files the setup ask
2 Download and install patch 1.00 to 1.01
3 Download and install patch 1.01 to 1.02
*( I didn't test it with 1.00 to 1.02 )
4 Install LOMAC Flaming Cliffs (1.10), StarForce will be installed with FC.
5 Download and install patch 1.10 to 1.11
6 Download and install patch 1.11 to 1.12b, This Patch ""update"" the Starforce protection.
7 Install Patch 1.01 to 1.02 again or 1.00 to 1.02, this patch will ""break"" the StarForce Protection.
8 Play

This is the most ""Patched"" way,  you DO install patch 1.02 again, BUT the changes and benefits of versions 1.10, 1.11 and 1.12b stay on your LOMAC. 

Good Luck to all"
,kollumer,2008-03-26T10:40Z,"When i wrote my guide, i was installing it to. So it is good. The 1.12 update version i used was:
LO_Flaming_Cliffs_Patch_1.12b_EngCD_Gold-Euro

,kollumer,2008-04-04T12:45Z,"Hi guys.

I'm having a strange problem here. In my last post, i said that it was easy to install. But now i have a new xp install, and i can't seem to install it properly again. Also, i have to use the 1.12b us gold patch to update the game, but i am sure i used the eng patch before. Any ideas?

The fact that it can be played when patched to 1.12b without starforce problems indicates that there now is room for people who want to make a fixed exe. just spread the word."

,Crayola67,2008-04-06T03:10Z,"you guys know theres a starforce removal tool available at lockonfiles.com right?

--------------------------------------------------------
 Please note that the Starforce removal tool is only to be used if you want to remove Lockon from your system. First uninstall lockon then run tool. If you run tool without uninstalling Lockon, Lockon will automatically install starforce drivers the next time it is executed. 1.12 patch does NOT remove starforce protection but reduces CD check to once a week instead of every time you run lockon.

i think this method is all about put your cpu to work at 100% before run the game twice. at my pc this takes about 15mins and i dont know if this works with 1.11, 1.12 or 1.12b
p.s. i opened and closed task manager some times to check out the cpu usage wile wating file transer ends."

,Helen_Sanders,2008-08-25T00:29Z,"Ok, Ladies and Gentlemen.

I THINK I have the solution:

Burn the imagefile to a DVD using BlindWrite:  http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3902383/BlindWrite_v6.0.4.36 

In BlindWrite, set the configuration to Automatic Profile and lowest burn speed available for your system.
Burn, install the game and play.  

By the way:
I use Vista SP1, so I had to update the Starforce Protection driver. The update is here: 
http://www.star-force.com/support/sfdrvup.zip 

This, believe it or not, worked perfectly for me.  
No need for a, b or whatever update."
,Combichrist,2008-08-25T03:28Z,"Another one solution without burning CD'S:

1.get the latest Daemon Tools Lite from http://disc-tools.com and install it
2.install LOMAC (first image)
3.apply lock_on_v1.01_to_v1.02 patch
4.install Flaming Cliffs (second image)
5.apply LO_Flaming_Cliffs_Patch_1.12b_EngCD_Addon&Gold-US patch
6.get Anti-blaxx 1.8, install and go to Settings, under Daemon Tools field find daemon.exe,then select Securom7 as protection and under Game field find lockon.exe and press close
7.run Daemon-tools, mount second CD
8.apply lock_on_upgrade_all_v1.02 patch 
9.run the game through Anti-blaxx and have fun ;))

5. use windows add hardware to add the driver on your computer

My OS is Xp Sp3, instead of Vista like Helen_sanders."
,Rixan,2008-12-22T16:28Z,"UPDATE: Helen_Sanders IS RIGHT!!!

As I said before, I followed the instructions but... I didn't update FC to the latest version.
So THIS should be the DEFINITIVE method:

1. Burn the imagefile to a DVD using BlindWrite: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3902383/BlindWrite_v6.0.4.36  and setting it to Automatic Profile and lowest burn speed (mine was 2.4x and took about 5minutes)

2. Install Flaming Cliffs FROM DVD. No Daemon Tools or Anti-blaxx needed!

3. Update SF with  http://www.star-force.com/support/sfdrvup.zip 

4. REBOOT

5. Download and install Lock ON Patch - 1.1 (CD installed) to 1.12b  http://www.virtual-jabog32.de/index.php?section=downloads&subcat=17&file=724〈=en

6. Launch Lock On: FC and as it will ask to reboot, answer YES.

7. Enjoy this beautiful Sim and think if it's worth to support these guys with just $14,95 for the original one.

Ciao

1. Get the first CD of the game, which is not in this torrent, but in the Lock On GOLD torrent. Install only CD 1 now. This will install the 1.00 or 1.01 version (it doesn't matter).
2. Download and install this patch http://patches.ubi.com/lock_on_modern_air_combat/lock_on_upgrade_all_v1.02.exe which updates the older 1.00 or 1.01 to the more recent 1.02 version.
3. Burn the CD 2 (Flaming Cliffs) imagefile to a physical CD using BlindWrite: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3902383/BlindWrite_v6.0.4.36 and setting it to Automatic Profile and lowest burn speed.
4. Install Flaming Cliffs (CD 2) from the physical CD you burned. Do NOT run the game yet.
5. Because you may not know if you already have StarForce installed by another game, it's best to uninstall the StarForce by using this utility from http://www.star-force.com/support/sfdrvrem.zip
6. Reboot/Restart your computer.
7. Now run ""Lock On.exe"" from the game folder (or your desktop shortcut). The game will NOT work now, but will install StarForce and after that it asks for reboot. So just say Yes to reboot.
8. After step 6, you know that StarForce is installed so you can now update it using this utility from http://www.star-force.com/support/sfdrvup.zip
9. Reboot you computer.
10. Download and install the patch 1.12b from this link http://www.virtual-jabog32.de/index.php?section=downloads&subcat=17&getfile=724
11. Run the Lock On.exe from game folder or desktop shortcut. This will ask you to install some libraries for StarForce. Accept it and click Yes when it asks to reboot.
12. Put the physical CD in the drive and run the game. It should run and pass the CD check with success. You can now put the CD out of the drive for a week because the checking is done once a week.

This method has more steps but I am confident it works every time (unless you don't even know how to extract files from an archive)."
,ZEDAWMN,2009-01-23T01:09Z,I don't want to wait to check the disc at the start of the game. The check is too slow... and it check the disc every time I start the game.
,BookieM,2009-02-04T18:27Z,"Ion, Milance and others with sucess of turnaround SF, which type of widows runing for ya? and service pack please?"
,BookieM,2009-02-04T18:27Z,I mean windows heh sry
,ionpopabc,2009-02-05T18:10Z,"@BookieM: I have Windows XP with Service Pack 2. I am sure it works with Vista too but maybe you'd need to try turning off UAC (User Account Control) if you have problems. To turn it off go to Start -> Run -> type ""msconfig"" and hit  then go to the ""Tools"" tab, select ""Disable UAC"" from the list and hit ""Launch"". Then hit ""OK"" and reboot your PC. Then just try to reinstall from the beginning."
,strangerben,2009-02-05T22:59Z,"I tried the ""Helen Sanders and Rixan"" way of installing as written down by ionpopabc however it doesn't work for me. I ve written the image file of CD 2 to a CD-RW (I dont know whether it may be the problem) and the speed of writing was 10X, cause I had only this option. I start the game with the CD-RW in the drive, the Checking Disk windows appears and after about 4 minutes the following damn message appears: ""Failed to identify disk. Insert a licensed disk."" 
Anyway the linked patch (http://www.virtual-jabog32.de/index.php?section=downloads&subcat=17&getfile=724) is a patch of version 1.12a."
,ionpopabc,2009-02-09T07:56Z,"@strangerben: I am almost sure it would work with a CD-R instead of CD-RW. By the way, notice i wrote CD and not DVD, because I'm not so sure you can write the image of a CD onto a DVD (and if you could, would it work ???)

In case my method doesn't work, try Rixan's or Helen Sanders' method. The point is don't give up too easily.

Warning : The method with Anti-Blaxx (posted by Combichrist and others) is NOT correct, as it only installs version 1.02 of the ""LockOn.exe"" in the last step, so you can't play with Su-25T. The only Su-25 you can fly is the older non-""T"" version. I know it because I already tried that."
,strangerben,2009-02-09T21:10Z,"I've written the image file of Flaming Cliffs to a CD-R but it does not work either. The Checking Disk comes up when I start the game and (like with the CD-RW) and after approx. 4 minutes it finishes and the next appears: Failed to identify disk. Insert a licensed disk. Like with the CD-RW. The image file was written with the Blindwrite you recommended. It was written with a speed of 8X (the min.) and with Automatic profile.  Dunno what the problem is. Last summer I managed to launch Flaming Cliffs with a CD-RW, which was written with Alcohol120% with the StarForce Datatype.  But now that CD-RW does not work. :S

To solve the problem I would be grateful if ionpopabc and the others, who wanna make this game work   gave their MSN address.  We should pass StarForce."

,fdr123,2009-02-10T17:04Z,"ionpopabcss way worked for me its all down to the 1.12b patch if after 1.12b patch you see the orange starforce check its the wrong patch after patch it shud be white with a blue border i also burnt it with nero on to a dvd rw so it DOES WORK IF YOU DOIT RIGHT IVE HAD THIS GAME YEARS AND NOT BEEN ABLE TO PLAY TILL NOW

,ionpopabc,2009-02-11T00:29Z,I promise to put some pictures (maybe tomorrow if I have time) with each step of the installation of this game (in Windows XP Service Pack 2). It will probably be my last comment on this torrent.
,DaNoob,2009-02-15T16:58Z,"What someone needs to do is make an antistarforce driver for this game, or crack it like they did wit hthe russain version of DCS black shark. Yes starforce can be cracked its just harder cause you need to crack a assload of dll files."
,DaNoob,2009-02-15T16:59Z,for anyone who can crack look at the DCS black shark crack on gamecopyworld.com because it might show you where to look and what to crack.
,panter4,2009-03-04T04:47Z,"finaly... after hours of working on this... i got it to work

i have made 2 diferences from the instructions posted

1. (fairly obvious but not written down) you have to disable all daemon tools virtual drives
2. i have vista so the starforce drivers wont install before the patch so first install the 1.12b patch and then try running the game for the first time to install starforce drivers and libraries
3. newer versions of blindwrite wont work (atleast the newest one) get the exact version posted"
,DaNoob,2009-03-20T20:47Z,You can crack this it just will take someone who knows what they are doing. Most of the people with the skill who can crack this game dotn even know about it.You dont just crack the exe you also have to crack a few .dll files just like whoever cracked DCS black shark russain...
,airsangel,2009-04-17T16:24Z,seeeed this awesome torrent

,Steam.Machine,2009-07-19T08:31Z,"Anti-blaxx method works fine but is useless for Multiplayer through hyperlobby as it attempts to open the main exe... 
Still fun in SP though! I'm just too lazy to go through the other methods just now xD 

Thanks for the upload!"
,theo.ask,2009-08-09T10:43Z,"Hello,

I downloaded Russian version of Flaming Cliffs from piratebay. I need to download the Russian to English patch 1.1 from this site (torrent). But then which 1.12 patch should I pally ? The EU gold one? The USA? There is a Russian one from the official lock-on page but it's in Russian and I don't understand Russian. Then how do I make the game work to bypass Starforce? I have Lock-on installed too."
,4n41yz3r,2009-10-04T13:19Z,"It works!!! Helen_Sanders, Rixan, ionpopabc, fdr123 and panter4 method works! Thx alot guys! Seeding 10x!!!!!!!!!!!

The KEY is to WRITE this image to a DVD (I used DVD+R and BlindWrite), and after that you pretty much have the original disc since Starforce cannot tell the difference!

Second, you MUST also DISABLE ALL virtual drives and RESTART your machine. Starforce will NOT run the game even from the ORIGINAL disc as long as there are any virtual drives enabled on your computer.

How to disable drives if you are using DaemonTools: Right click on DT tray icon -> Virtual CD/DVD -> Set number of devices -> Disable. RESTART computer afterwards.

I dont use Alcohol or others, but for a start its good idea to uninstall any emulating software you might be having.

Many thanks to the uploader!"

,mimorqleko,2010-03-17T18:06Z,"I had issues with the CD check using the methods described previously... But finally I managed to run the game properly. 

Follow this 10 easy steps carefully.

1. Use StarFoce remover ""sfdrvrem.exe"" to remove any trace of StarForce (the CD protection used by this game).

2. Install Lock On v1.0

3. Run the update v1.02

4. Burn THIS TORRENT's CD image on a CD (CD-R or CD-RW) with Alcohol 120%. (YES, a CD!!)
   Write Method: DAO/SAO
   Write Speed: 4X (600 KB/Sec) or less.
   Leave all the other setting as default.

Alcohol120% 2.0.0.1331 trial will do it. ;)

5. Install ""Flaming Cliffs"" from the CD you just burned.

6. Install the patch 1.12b

7. Run ""Lock On.exe"". The protection system will ask to install additional stuff. Press YES.

8. Reboot

9. Install StarForce Update ""sfdrvup.exe"" (to enable weekly CD checks)

10. Disable any virtual drive and insert the Flaming Cliffs CD. Run ""Lock On.exe"" and Enjoy!!!


Remember, no need to insert the CD each time you run the game, just weekly.  ;)

,mimorqleko,2010-03-18T15:23Z,"The success of passing the protection depends a lot in you CD/DVD reader.

* First try using a CD-RW, if it doesn't work then try burning a DVD-R, and so on, always using the minimum burning speed available.

* For those under windows 7 just follow the steps carefully and you won't have any trouble. ;)"

,TheProphetD,2010-04-29T13:23Z,"It doesn't matter that much, burn it on 10x."
,gumidekcz,2010-04-29T13:55Z,"I did, on CD-RW, with Alcohol120 (Write Method: DAO/SAO, all the other setting as default) with 10x speed. Starforce scheck didnt pass. Now I found regular CD-R and burned with 4x speed. So Im courious if it will works..
Sorry for my english"

 but than suddenly.....tadaaaaaa =D
Rename FlamingCliffs.mdf to EVL0000412.mdf
