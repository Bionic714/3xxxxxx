far as i can tell, this is a total flop."
,mrtt,2006-01-24T00:53Z,Downloaded 35 times? Does this work or not? Not a singel comments about the game from 35 downloaders so this is working? Right? Please answer me just yes or no if this is a working version.
,callmebob,2006-01-24T03:05Z,"i´M the f*ck who at least tried to upload this.

sorry it´s my first ever attempt to actually up something, and i´ve gotten neither positive or negative comments.

i would like to know if  anyone grabbed this, and if not what have i done wrong??

i would like to up some more stuff, but not if i don´t know if it is working.

I bet you´re pissesd as well if you grab something that is useless!!"
,mrtt,2006-01-24T13:49Z,"Yes, never fun to download any things who does't work, but this one is downloaded 35 times, 35 people out there who can tell me and the uploader if this is working, please do so now!"
,poppadon56,2006-01-30T22:19Z,"Don't think it's NTSC, has a file named SCES_508.85, does this not mean it is PAL?"
,callmebob,2006-01-31T21:08Z,"finally a response. i hope this means it is working.

i think it´s ntsc, but maybe japanese.

the language is english in any case.

my ps2 slimeline is a pal version, crystal chip bm1.6 and it runs fine, but the screen is ""pushed down"" a bit, so i couldn´t quite read wich sony group put it out.

would appreciate any further info as to the ""grabbers"" got a working game or not."
,mrtt,2006-02-09T14:09Z,"I have downloaded this myself, after all no one is telling if it's working or not so I did't myself. The download is working perfect, but I have not tested it yet, so I will come back to you when I have tried it out in my PS2"
,mrtt,2006-02-09T15:19Z,"Just so you know, the game is working perfect, so youre upload is working. now you know, please up more great/funny realeses. Thx a lot ""callmebob""."
