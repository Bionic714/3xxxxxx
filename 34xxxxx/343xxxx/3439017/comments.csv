,pege63,2006-10-12T15:54Z,This is a OS not a APPs 4 xbox
,Necro-File,2006-11-02T01:43Z,"Windows XP Media Center Edition with Service Pack 2

Works fine, has adware, but that is the case of pretty much every pirated version of XP, but if you install a virus scanner before going online, it will take care of everything.

This is not specifically FOR the xbox, but is needed to stream videos and not just pics and music to a 360. AFAIK, you can not go vice versa on this (stream videos from the 360 to the PC) unless you have Media Center Connect (another app from Microsoft to connect PCs and other devices through a subnet).

Not recommended for people who do not need to or want to install a new OS, or for those who do want a new OS but don't need the whizbang gimmicks of total media convergence (music, images, videos, games and television). It is however the most stable XP version yet and is updated more often than XP Home and XP Pro."
,Necro-File,2006-11-02T01:49Z,"Forgot to add this:

Any virus warnings for ""Hacktool"" are because your antivirus is picking up the WPA_KILL.EXE file (which is a failsafe in case you accidentally re-installed Windows Genuine Advantage and/or updated it)."
,csersjovt,2006-11-30T18:52Z,Fucking nQQb... There is no virus and it's not a fucking xbox game u fairy fuck!
,Gangster4life,2007-01-06T02:07Z,Does this thing install new windows with media center or only media center but the windows stay same.

,sil40sx,2007-02-05T10:26Z,"can i burn this to a DVD, or do i have to burn it on 2 cd's. also, does it need a serial? thanks!"
,xxninjabynightxx,2008-01-19T00:23Z,Windows can be installed on a 360 through linux if you have an older kernal and linux installed already.
,DanteHasArrived,2008-03-22T12:02Z,"Hey, cheers for the upload. =)

Just a few questions.

Do you use the setup in the MCE Folder or the PRO2 Folder?

And if you are installing over another copy of XP (Home Edition) will your data be lost?

Thanks, "
,mikeysama,2008-03-28T03:31Z,"Virus scanner is picking up a virus in the crack folder, but since I'm using it with a legitimate CD key, I'm just going to leave out the CRACK folder when I burn it to be on the safe side."
,Stargater94,2008-04-20T04:50Z,"wait a sec, wtf is this? if this is windows xp MCE 2005 then why the **** is it in the Games > XBOX360 section???? er, idk...."
,Drebeesie,2008-04-23T03:35Z,playboy22 miscatogorized... Well kind of! you can use WMCE to sync shit w/ ur xbox 360... So he wasn't totally wrong!!! Does this thing work? I haven't heard it doesn't yet... So I assume it will.

,brandoom,2008-08-13T03:13Z,"For people who are getting this to use with their xbox to stream video and songs, you do not need media center! Just use media player 11 and share with your xbox on ethernet. I went through 2 complete new installs before i found this out and went back to xp pro.  "
,NuRdKrUsHeR,2008-08-14T15:23Z,"Ok listen you cannot load this on your xbox
