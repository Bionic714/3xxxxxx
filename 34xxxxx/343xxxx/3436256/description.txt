The Global Islamic Media Front, an al-Qaeda mouthpiece, issued a 28:30 minute video today, January 22, 2006, titled: ?Jihad Academy,? depicting an amalgamation of clips of attacks executed by Iraqi insurgency groups including al-Qaeda in Iraq, the Mujahideen Army, and the Islamic Army in Iraq. The film, ?directed? by Mousslim Mouwaheed, carried an attached message indicating that the events portrayed in ?Jihad Academy? are to show a ?single day for those whom struggle in Allah's cause,? as attacks are shown in the dawn hours through the dark of night. Amongst these attacks are sniper operations, including those from the Islamic Army in Iraq?s ?Juba ? compilation, detonations of improvised explosive devices (IED?s) on a variety of targets, rocket and mortar fire, and readings of martyr?s wills.
