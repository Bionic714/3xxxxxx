,phoenix129,2006-02-05T15:43Z,"At some point, I actually felt sorry for the Iraqis. But from what I've seen, they're worse than the Americans. Coward snipers and bombers... fight like men!"

,migho75,2006-02-16T14:40Z,"Warfare itself is developed more and more to economic affairs than religious or political affairs in the course of time. It is a useful tool in a superpowers handcase and it is a sound of porridge bell to the armaments industries. 
A big country means great economical position globally. Money is everything. To achieve this some countries are willing to send to death their own countryman. Where is the beef? ""Democracy""? ""Freedom""? ""To get rid of weapons of mass destruction""? ""Anti-terrorist operation""? Well, on the side they killed (liberated?) tens of thousands of iraqis, civilians (laterate damage). War is ugly thing, baby! By the way: if you read this... get a life."

the idiots died because they went to occupy another nation and kill it's people with white phosphorus and cluster bombs and i'm not talking about armed people.  iraq never attacked the united states and the united states made the choice that it's battle field should be the streets and backyards of the iraqi people.  then they deserve even more till they leave.
