,wilco123123123,2006-02-28T22:27Z,ZeeJustin cheated in this tournament by playing with multiple accounts and has had his funds confiscated. Not such an accomplishment now.
,Joor,2006-04-06T11:17Z,Can someone seed this pls
,drpoker.real,2006-04-09T23:55Z,Zeejustin did not cheat in this tournament..Leejones the pokerstarts room director posted in 2+2 forum and said they checked the tournament and he did not cheat on it. ALthough he was banned from the site...he was ound to have cheated in another tournament but only won less than 5000 dollars the amount was minimal....ZEE won this tournament fair and square
,drpoker.real,2006-04-21T02:14Z,"you need to make sure when you uplaod torrents that you put poker in the description or else when people put poker in the search, it will not come up..the more words of poker are spelled out in your file, the more it will seed. And make sure you leave your torrent file your sharing open!! so that you could share, give it time and it will increase..."
