,Deputy276,2008-07-31T01:27Z,I saw the first movie (not the TV series). Was pretty decent. I'm glad they made a follow-up. Even if it is a TV series. 
,lorddoom1985,2008-09-30T14:54Z,Color problems. Twice now so far I am 41:40/1:27:02 of the first disc so far. First instance was a black/white the second was a blue tint. It cleared up but it still might happen again. Will report more info if it gets worse.
,lorddoom1985,2008-09-30T16:22Z,The color problem is in part 2 as well. 17:28 of the video it turns blue tint then back to normal. I think it will keep happening even into part 3.
