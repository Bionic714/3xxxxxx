 Optimizations.......: Custom mplayer.dll compiled from CVS with GCC 3.4.4
                       using --disable-libavformat. Greatly reduces the size of 
                       the dll at the cost of not being able to demux a few
                       obscure formats.
                       Reduced size of bloated scripts from 3601KB to 941KB.

 Functionality.......: WMV9, RealVideo and Quicktime codecs included and tested.
                       Scripts menu edited to include added scripts.
                       Added weather display and IP address to home screen.
                       Project Mayhem III webserver interface by KanadaKid.

 Release Notes.......: Replaced the huge set of Mildrop presets with a set
                       containing only the best ones.
                       To remove either weather or IP address from home screen,
                       edit skinProject Mayhem IIIPALHome.xml (or PAL16x9).
                       At the bottom of the file, change <visible> from true to
                       false for the items you want to remove.
                       To use the original mplayer.dll instead, move it to
                       xbmcsystemplayersmplayer. Download the file at:
