,PHBFO,2006-01-28T10:03Z,Wowww thanks Mogz!!!!! :-D
,skierr,2006-01-28T11:12Z,"Thanks
however i think that Lago and Cloud9 are two different products.
Lago""frecce tricolori"" was released last year meanwhile Cloud9 ""frecce tricolori"" has been released last week.
This is Lago Frecce Tricolori
;-)"
,Mogz,2006-01-28T13:08Z,"@skier well chk out this link.... http://www.simflight.com/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=5128 . Now scroll down to the very bottom. ""developer:Cloud9 - Publisher: LagoSim"" well i may be wrong with the ""title"" of this torrent but its basicly a ""beta"" of the cloud9 release. sry wasnt paying attention to release dates. (some interesting facts: Dl sizes Cloud9 ~98mb Lago ~185Mb) they must of left out alot since the ""lago"" version :p"

,experimental_pilot,2006-01-28T17:05Z,"Mogz, you said that ""Dl sizes Cloud9 ~98mb Lago ~185Mb"" Why is this torrent 238mb?"
,barp,2006-01-28T17:13Z,"i think its because its the cd version and it includes videos and such, don't it?"
,barp,2006-01-31T20:51Z,"just tried the Cloud9 version and the Cloud9 version is so much better then the lago version, so if any 1 could get the cloud9 one it will be great!!!
BTW thanks Mogz for this one."
