,MelonenBag,2008-06-17T11:21Z,"Hello.
I don´t have a windows now in my new computer and all versions of windows i´ve tried doesn´t work because my computer says: DISKBOOT ERROR: PLEASE INSERT SYSTEMDISK AND PRESS ENTER. This happens because the windowsfiles (downloaded) doesn´t contain a file that helps my computer to boot from the cd.

My question is if anyone knows if this torrent can start an installation without having a windows before.
