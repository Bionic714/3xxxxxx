,Nightwalker05,2007-05-01T23:54Z,"This is a product to be bought. I shamefully regret I had a cracked version of this software, but I am BUYING this software because I have learnt what a brilliant man Steve Gibson (the creator) truly is (and that goes for his product too). Spinrite saves reputations and businesses, it deserves its fee and more. YOU CAN CHOOSE the right thing and purchase SpinRite here: http://www.grc.com/spinrite.htm

You can also listen to Steve Gibson's superb free security podcast here:
