Review
-----------
Shot in Kenya, City of God director Fernando Meirelles' The Constant Gardener is a taut political thriller that follows the murder of an activist in South Africa. Longtime Pedro Almodovar collaborator Alberto Iglesias provides a soft, spacious, and ultimately devastating score that utilizes native instrumentation like the marimba, thumb harp, and ronroco. Iglesias uses this folk instrumentation as a base for orchestrations that are as beautiful as they are anxious, resulting in a soundtrack with a distinct sense of place that's contemporary enough to engross listeners from any cultural standpoint. Highlights include "Roadblock," "Procession," and two outstanding pieces from Kenyan-born worldbeat artist Ayub Ogada.
