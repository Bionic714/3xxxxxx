[V],nimbus123,2006-02-01T09:52Z,Awfully small size to be the full game =P
,raus,2006-02-01T16:22Z,"This is probably not the full game, nimbus, but only a NoCD crack. If it is supposed to include the full game, it is obviously fake."
,Only_mac,2006-02-02T13:57Z,"somebody have this game for mac: TIGER WOODS PGA TOUR速 2005 , please upload it"
[V],nimbus123,2006-02-03T17:08Z,"Ya, raus, I know. Was just being sarcastic. "
,Rufstroll,2006-02-08T23:52Z,Could someone please seed. Dont mean to be rude but the game is pretty useless without this app. Thanks.
,anders_and,2006-06-24T18:53Z,"it's not even a crack, it's an empty folder."
,Supertux13,2006-06-26T10:36Z,You can download this The Sims 2+University Expansion from http://tr.searching.com/view.php?id=407104
,raymond-cavanough,2007-02-18T02:02Z,"It works wonderfully.

Yes, it looks like an empty folder, but it is what acts as the CD. Mount the dmg file and then try and open Sim City 4. Works like a charm!"
,sir huor,2007-06-12T16:57Z,"can any 1 seed please?

greets"
,Hac,2007-07-30T14:58Z,Anybody have the game ? 
,jumbz55,2007-12-06T01:57Z,Please seed! I've been looking for a working one of these for ages.

,Symn,2008-04-04T19:06Z,"I'm looking for the full 'Deluxe version' for MAC, does anyone have it?"
,mooiemcmoo,2008-04-04T19:28Z,"doesnt work, i have downloaded it. Can anyone tell me how to open it and play the game?"
,DeadDarkMind,2008-04-22T01:16Z,works just like raymond-cavanough said. i'm using an intel macbook.
,l3viathan,2009-05-01T17:22Z,"This didn't work for me.  I've updated SC4 to version 1.1A, though.  Didn't try it before the update.  Won't mount with Toast, and mounting with Disk Utility doesn't do anything to stop the CD check for me.  Guess I'll just stick to mounting the full CD image with Toast."
,fd.villa,2009-05-01T21:26Z,piece of crap... doesn't work. i tried to mount it and it doesn't recognize the image as the simcity disk it's just an empty folder
,Symn,2009-11-03T20:04Z,"did exactly what cavanaugh said, it is NOT working!!

MBP 2008 10.5.8"
,julialy,2010-09-12T05:50Z,use the show hidden files command and SEE?
