,_Luke_,2006-01-14T15:40Z,"this is full game?
only multiplayer?"
,Fulscreen866,2006-01-14T18:48Z,"It is the full game with Singleplayer and Multiplayer support.
And darth_tater, this is not spam, it's serious. I play it all the time with my friends over the internet, but you need Kali for On-line support. And there is no need to pay for anything."
,Me-LoDon,2006-01-15T10:09Z,Can some-one upload emperor battle for dune plz.
,Fulscreen866,2006-01-17T11:25Z,Emperor Battle? is that an add-on or something?
,ZellSF,2006-01-18T18:31Z,"Emperor: Battle For Dune is the next game in the series.

And this torrent is probably a movie rip. Maybe music too."
,dekuboy,2006-01-20T20:59Z,"If this works, i'm gonna have one happy girlfriend ;)

cheers, keep the sharing."
,GWiZ,2006-01-21T05:54Z,"Dune 2000 is awesome. Thanks. Also, I would think that you can get around using Kali... 
I can't remember if Dune 2000 supports it, but if you can use Local Area Network, you can use the program Hamachi, which you can get here: http://www.hamachi.cc/

It's totally sweet, and works with any game that supports LAN. Great way to avoid using Battle.net for Blizzard games as well. ;-)"
,Fulscreen866,2006-01-25T22:08Z,"YEah, I tried Hamachi but it won't work for us... maybe you know some settings we need to set?"
,Fulscreen866,2006-02-02T19:32Z,"It is the complete game, with multi-player AND single-player. Only the video's between missions are not in."
,wizzard of bob,2006-02-04T14:15Z,Reseed plz thank you!
,Fulscreen866,2006-02-07T18:56Z,ok np

,Crazy Bastard,2006-05-30T20:50Z,"SEED THIS AWESOME GAME ^^,"
,sulliken,2006-09-23T17:32Z,Plz seed this again. Awsome game. I played it on my Amiga500 back in the days.
,Breadfan866,2007-10-18T23:33Z,"I am trying to re-seed, but it's not working somehow..."
,jepuhu,2008-02-28T20:48Z,seed please i love the game
,Sprtan117,2008-03-27T05:35Z,How do i play the game ? i already installed kali and i downloaded dune 200 what do i do next?
,cobracomm,2008-06-10T13:48Z,"scanned with AVG 8.0.100

found virus in Dune2000.exe:

Trojan horse Generic10.AKCL

otherwise great game. And I actually played it for a couple weeks before discovering this :("
,zerocool512,2008-06-14T16:34Z,I think it is just the coding that is in the DUNE2000.EXE that AVG sees as a threat.  I have tried every image and version of the game and AVG sees it every time.  I do not think that every image would have the same virus
,cobracomm,2008-06-15T08:38Z,"I agree zero. Yet, even after disabling my AVG, assuming it was a false positive, I then get this error window when attempting to launch the executable (DUNE200.exe):

Windows cannot access the specified device, path, or file. You may not have the appropriate permissions to access the item. 

Using a legit Windows XP Pro, SP3. And I am positive that I am logged in as admin.

What gives?"
,X-43bfn,2010-05-13T04:46Z,"I used to have this game --  there is NO trial version -- but when I got my new pc and vista the screen was messed up (check this http://forum.dune2k.com/index.php?topic=15837.0 just in case) I also knew a person who created a portable and has made many breakthroughs in the game, by the name of Gruntlord6. For his files: http://dune.gruntmods.com/"
,Janiac,2010-05-25T18:42Z,Thank you so much. Works perfectly. Ive been looking for a real version of this everywhere.
,spoofycat,2012-06-21T19:22Z,THANK YOU!!! works well but i dont get any in game movies:(
