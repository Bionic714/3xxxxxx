theres no NOCD crack so your stuck outside your freashly downloaded game...

i hate it when people put up defective torrents..."
,wintercom,2007-02-21T01:55Z,"Guys the torrent is fine, the problem is with the game itself. The initial version had a bug which meant it would only look at the first CD drive it found on a machine.

To fix it you just need to download this patch: http://www.sierra.com/publish/sierra/en/home/games/game_info.tab-downloadtab.prod-L2NvbnRlbnQvc2llcnJhL2VuL3Byb2R1Y3RzL2hvbWV3b3JsZF9fX2dhbWVfb2Y%3d.platform-global.html

and then the game runs fine :)"
,MPitard,2007-02-22T06:27Z,Please seed
,ExterminatorBG,2007-02-25T20:04Z,"A classic game and the OST song is just great for it is ""Yes - Homeworld"" the group made it is called Yes and the song name is Homeworld."
,MPitard,2007-03-06T06:27Z,"When I try to play multiplayer, it says my CD key is invalid, what should I do?"
,Blackninja729,2007-03-14T03:15Z,It may be that I'm a little new to playing a game from a torrent...but for some reason the only file I have with any actual data is an MDF file named 'HOMEWORLD'. I don't understand how to get the program to run from just this....any suggestions?
,Blackninja729,2007-03-15T08:58Z,"Nevermind, managed to find a solution through sheer stubborness."
,pagliacci,2007-04-20T00:03Z,Love to have a few more seeders please :)
,Zensch,2007-05-20T17:37Z,"Never tried this game but always wanted to.

Will seed it for a while once I grab it!"
,Durandal-Thoth,2007-06-13T12:42Z,"
 A quick note to newbies:

 When you download the file, you'll receive an MDF and MDS file. All this really is is a virtual image of the disk, the MDF being the data, and the MDS being the descriptor. To actually be able to use it, just download a program that is capable of mounting such files onto a virtual CD drive. 

 Alcohol 52% is an excellent tool for such a thing. It's free and can be found here http://trial.alcohol-soft.com/en/

 I won't walk you through using the program, as there are other sites out there to deal with that. 

 Good luck."
,Aryonas,2007-07-09T15:20Z,There's a god damn virus in this. It downloads as a file in the torrent but it's instantly placed in your temp folder as a mirror temp .exe.  when you try to install the game the virus automatically engages and your pc moves it from the temp folder because it uses it to read the .exe. It's placed very cleverly.     There's no crack or serial key in this shitty torrent anyway. lol
,fallout11,2007-08-15T11:52Z,"
There is no virus in this package, and it works perfectly (am playing it now). 
The crack/serial can be found on page one of the comments."
,Skyl3lazer,2007-11-29T01:37Z,"Virus? I think not. If there's some crap with an exe going on, it's on your end."
