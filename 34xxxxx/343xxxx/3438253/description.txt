Drama - "Flying over the 21st Century"(1998)

Very original French band which delivers a symphonic and strong music with some fusion influences. Skilled musicians, who are able to perform many different moods and feels with certain virtuosism. They offer a golden Progressive rock in the vein of MARILLION, GENESIS, YES or IQ.
