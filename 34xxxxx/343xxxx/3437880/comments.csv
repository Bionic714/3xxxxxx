,lesinge,2006-01-30T22:05Z,"With spelling like that, It just reeks of quality.... :P"
,slindfors3,2006-01-31T15:12Z,"I'd skip it if I were you, Symantec antivirus goes ballistic over atleast one of the files (5 counts of adware so far(cstart.exe)). And I definatly don't trust a ""game"" that downloads files of the internet without my concent. The uninstall shortcut it installs does not uninstall it, it tries to run said file again."
,eddie2hands,2006-01-31T23:59Z,It is a casino sim. Slots and cards.
,starkey,2006-02-01T09:23Z,too bad. I hoped for the slut game
