,zeeboowahmoo,2008-08-18T00:11Z,"Thanks for the up, but the quality is very poor and it is not complete.
I have a high quality commercial video of this in storage somewhere and when I root it out I'll share it.  It's really great and it's a big shame that their isn't a high quality copy out in torrent land."
,tktorrents,2008-09-14T11:04Z,"For those that are seeking this vid...

I'll be uploading either a DVD rip of BOTH:

Tales from the Far Side 1
and
Tales from the Far Side 2

...or at least the image/ISO of the DVD!! 

(would have been done already, but my main PC is getting a motherboard swap).

I'll update here once I get the torrent made... it's coming, I promise.

I haven't figured out how I'll do the torrent(s) so suggest what you'd prefer... ISO of the DVD or seperate rips.

Or... if you can't wait and want to support GL's work... go here:

It's a bit spendy though at $39.95"

Gary Larson's Tales from the Far Side 1 & 2 DVD ISO

Enjoy."
