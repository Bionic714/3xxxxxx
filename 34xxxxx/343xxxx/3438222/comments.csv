,Astralia,2006-01-31T23:16Z,"Koto ja!!! Jag älskar ju ""spacesynth"" :) (Koto, Laserdance, Proxyon etc.)

Har dock denna redan på retail dvd ;)"
,GOYA551,2006-02-06T21:42Z,"Not working for me, both with the image mounted and with CD burned."
,GOYA551,2006-02-06T22:14Z,Working now. I used Daphneloader to change from US Enhancement 2.0 to 1.1L. Also had to download and install some OCX files to get Daphneloader to run.
,Kpin,2006-03-01T18:42Z,I can't seem to get it to work!  Can anyone give me a hand here?  Goya551? Anyone?  Going nuts with frustration here.

,dancingelmo,2006-03-06T06:36Z,Please seed...thank you!
,Kpin,2006-03-15T03:09Z,Thanks Kisson but didn't seem to work.  Daphne within the actual dl doesn't seem to contain any list of games within.  What framefile and mpeg file are you guys using to make it work?  Thanks!
,pokernod,2008-03-24T01:55Z,"Oh Goodie, Yet another Dragon's Lair Tease upon which to torture my Brain and destroy yet another keyboard (and possibly a monitor). 587Mb and only 10 comments huh, this should be a hoot. I tried the Dragon's Lair HD at 8Gb, at least this one wont take three days to DL just to find out I need a Phd. to figure out how to make it work again.
If anyone gets through this (alive), Please Come Back and give us all some real ""step by step"" instructions on how you pulled off this miracle. Ive been tracking this game down for a long time now and still havent gotton to actually play it.
Thanks"
,pokernod,2008-03-24T06:53Z,"If your not a Programmer, a Scientist, or have atleast a 140 I.Q. (like myself) dont bother with this, you will never get it to work.
I should Have recognized Daphne........You guys always wanting to put your experiments on here.
Just go here and download everything for free, its more to download (about thrice as much) but it will save you a really big headache.

,j_armitage,2008-03-28T01:46Z,"pokernod: Well, my IQ is only 136 (and that was back in 10th grade. doesn't it lower as you age?), so I guess I'm under the curve. Either way, I can't get this fucker to work either. guess my 80's flashback/mid-life crisis is doomed. Oh, well."
,mkrary,2008-05-20T02:41Z,"Got it to work :)

1.unzip
2.mount the .img file with Alcohol 120
3. (important) two program will run.  The cmd.exe and the emulator.  you must exit the cmd.exe for the emulator to work properly

let it load for 2 sec. and press the windows(logo between the ctrl and alt button) to access the CMD.EXE blank black screen and close it.

excellent game, nostalgic and fun"
,mkrary,2008-05-23T13:35Z,"And don't download from www.daphne-emu.com

And it's not free because you still need to buy the original DVD for the Daphneloader to work

Getto D's file works fine by itself"
,beardown50,2008-07-16T05:32Z,i bought the PC version of this game when it came out years ago....it sucked! I've been looking for this 4 a while! we'll see if i can get it to work. Wish me luck boys! (and girls)
,gallendrill,2009-01-24T21:49Z,it seem 2 be a BIG problem trying to figure out this daphne emulator which is by far the most confusing thing I ve ever seen however to those who have succeeded please try to give a specific walkthru on how to do this and if there is a system requirement because it keeps saying that it can t initialize laser disc after trying each setting and config that this thing has to offer and I even tried every suggestion posted here with nothing to show but a lot of useless cds and frustration
,gnetix,2009-02-27T09:17Z,"I'm not sure why people are experiencing problems on this one. All I had to do was mount the iso with Daemon tools. I seen two iso files but only one was visible in Daemon tools. I mounted and it took a little while, but worked. I am using an Acer laptop with Visduh!! Home Premium. Just got done downloading and my computer is hot but I going to turn it back on when I get up to seed. I have been looking for this for a long, long time now. Thank you uploader very much. I usually have my computer on during the daytime hours. Central time. I'm even going to make a Youtube vid of this to tell people where to find it. "
,gnetix,2009-02-27T20:45Z,"Wanted to come back and let everyone know that I posted a video of this torrent on youtube today! Go check it out to view quality of the game. Wanted to say thanks again to Getto D as well!!
OKAY... I couldn't past the youtube link here for some reason. Just go to youtube and seacch gnetix79- that's my user name- and look at my profile for the Dragon's Lair video!!"
[T],Mayweed2000,2009-05-26T02:25Z,"Getto D....thank you from the bottom of my heart!  I used to love playing this game at the arcade 20 years ago, and It's incredible to be able to play it again.  You're awesome, dude!

Everybody...this works, and it's perfect.  All I did was unzip the file from this torrent, then use Daemon Tools Lite to mount the image file, and that's it!"
,coolace,2009-05-31T14:37Z,"Thanks for the awesome upload.  Like many of you, I have been looking for a working copy of this game.  Yes, it was very simple; just mounted the image file with power iso and then went to the mounted drive and played the game.  The game does appear to run a little quicker than I remember, but still fun... Thanks again for the contribution...  Still seeding..."
,sobber23,2010-09-08T12:38Z,"THANKS SOOO MUCH!!!!!!!!!  Seriously, I created an account to thank Getto D for this dream came true!! 
This is far better (to my mind at least) than the DVD version : here, it is the actual arcade game, the original 4:3 screen (DVD version has been cut into 16:9!!). 
And you can get this without getting too old waiting :-)!!


Please Getto D, don't leave us like that, please please keep up the fantastic work and make us live the second Dragon's Lair adventure, and Space Ace, if you happen to have them!!!!!

And no need for a big IQ to get the work done.
If you don't have Alcohol 120Â°, Daemon tool will do it (and the Lite version is free, so I set my choice on this one).
As it has been said before :
1. unzip
2. Run Daemons Tool Lite and open IMAGE.cue with it. It will create the virtual CD and put it in the virtual drive on the lower part of the screen. (once it is done you should see a nice Dragon's Lair icon appearing.
3. double-click on the new icon, and then be patient (it takes a little while to run the game)
4. Enjoy the introduction
5. Enjoy the many many ways our fearless hero manages to die!!

...

6. Upload DRAGON'S LAIR II to keep the dream alive (yes, i'm begging down on my knees, so what ? Pride is overrated these days :-)   )


Once again, THANK YOU, Getto D!!! You really made my day!!!!!!!"
