from amazon:
A notch or two above The Grass Roots and The Mamas and Papas, and more than a few steps below The Byrds, the early Beau Brummels took the indulgently blissful sound of '60s San Fancisco rock into a folkier, borderline country direction (and would in fact later play solid country rock). Led by guitarist/writer Ron Elliott, the Brummels made a virtue of innocence and joyful bounce, and benefited from Sly Stone's energetic production. Hits include "Laugh, Laugh," "Sad Little Girl," and a pleasant take on the Bob Dylan song "One Too Many Mornings." There may not be much substance or invention here, but 30 years later, the Brummels still sound catchy.
