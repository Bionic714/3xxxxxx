Deep Purple in Rock is a hard rock album by Deep Purple released in 1970.

This was the first studio effort from the "Mark II" lineup of Deep Purple. Their earlier work was much more pop-oriented, with orchestra-driven tracks and covers that ranged from The Beatles to Neil Diamond among others, and on this record that is all gone. All tracks are credited to the working efforts of the five members of the band. "Speed King" and "Flight of the Rat" are prime examples of hard rock songs, and the band's new style. "Child in Time" is perhaps the most famous song from this record. This song starts off as a ballad but then becomes a rocker with many improvisations. The lyrics are more sophisticated on this song than the others on the album. "Child in Time" was the only song from this album that was included on Made in Japan two years later. In some countries (such as Mexico) In Rock also included "Black Night", a single recorded during the sessions.
