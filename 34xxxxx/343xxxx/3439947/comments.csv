,Buggery,2006-02-04T09:04Z,"If you were downloading d0main's torrent, stop.
Erase
Samurai Jack - Episode 45 - The Aku Infection.avi
Samurai Jack - Episode 21 - Jack and the Dragon.avi

and resume your download with this torrent instead."
,Buggery,2006-02-05T09:24Z,"It took a couple years for me to get every single episode all in one place.
If you want a particular format, re-encode it yourself."

,Buggery,2006-08-01T09:42Z,"This is just a simple cartoon, but the superb directing and excellent audio, writing and voice-acting make Samurai Jack a true vintage of animation. I can't allow it to be forgotten."

,clocker13,2007-03-18T10:47Z,"tbh, the quality of these is pretty bad, as they're TV rips, and pretty poor ones at that.

Dull, nasty colours, ZX spectrum quality sound, really really low res compared to the 1st series i downloaded a while back that someone had ripped from a DVD."
,weedmaan95,2007-08-05T14:16Z,goood shit
,scrapsoflife,2007-08-08T18:43Z,"You're right, it is poor quality. But whoever is seeding this particular moment is a god!"
,TheFactory,2007-08-24T08:49Z,How would one go about getting a higher quality out of these videos? Sorry for the lame question in advance.
,TheFactory,2007-08-24T08:51Z,How would one go about getting a higher quality out of these videos? Sorry for the lame question in advance. :p

normally i don't want people to advertise their torrents, but i think that mine is better, so here ya go...sorry if this bugs you"
,Buggery,2008-10-05T00:27Z,"It doesn't bother me at all. I uploaded this to replace an inferior but popular torrent that had some broken and some missing episodes with working ones at higher quality.
The original person who I counter-uploaded was not upset. So neither am I.

The reason only a few episodes are high-quality was so that I could make a torrent that the downloaders from his torrent could use. I told them to delete certain files and then resume their downloading with mine and it worked.

Samurai Jack is an artful, creative, and excellent series; and a rare gem. If you also have a better torrent, then ."
,Buggery,2008-10-05T00:28Z,I bow politely
,SNES_VS_PS1,2009-08-09T00:05Z,thank you very much!
,tripper511,2009-10-09T07:42Z,"a lot of these episodes are out of ordered and titled incorrectly if compared to wiki's episode guide: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Samurai_Jack_episodes
 and other torrents on this site."
