A preview release for the newly formed Winx Club Fansubs group meant as a test before we begin actually fansubbing the series.

This is a dual audio release of Winx Club episodes 1 and 2 in .MKV format, featuring both the original Italian version (unsubtitled) and the faithful U.K. English dub not shown in the U.S.

Don't let 4K!DS' butchered version of Winx Club fool ya' - this is the real deal!
