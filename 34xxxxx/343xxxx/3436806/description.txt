Superb music melodies of Tuvian nation - jews harps mixed with electric guitars and drums.Old folk music best traditions and tundra's ghost dreams comes true. Dive into  
shaman world and breath out deeply - You will be stunned.

P.S. write me if u liked this kind of music. I'll seed more this band's albums.
