,X,2006-01-23T21:37Z,Keygen doesn't work: INVALID FUCKING KEY
,darth,2006-01-24T01:28Z,"keygen worked fine here.  iirc you just need the serial number when installing.  After setup is complete and you run worperfect the first time it will ask the serial again.  Do phone activation, get the install code and copy it into the keygen, get the activation code and copy back.

Remember to remove the dashes in serials/keys and make sure you don't have internet access during this whole mess."

,Porkster,2006-02-09T02:08Z,Anyone got the ISO?  Wordperfect is so good for serious people. 
,Porkster,2006-02-09T02:16Z,Thx Darth

,Nachtworst,2006-03-02T01:55Z,Thanx! Hope everything works...
,odannyboy,2006-03-23T09:23Z,"This download is bollocks
done everything it says but what about the KEY!
Where the fack is that.
Reckon a corel md uploaded this trial.
posse we need a patch"
,FastBrad,2006-11-21T23:06Z,When I finally took out the dashes when entering the serial installation went perfectly. Maybe thats what some are not doing. This programs works fine. 
,greenbile,2008-03-27T05:03Z,"You want Wordperfect x3? Here are instructions that worked for me. I just downloaded corel x3 trial version from corel website and used the crack from http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3434211/Corel_-_Wordperfect_Office_X3. I did not download the application, just the crack. Before step one unplug internet connection because you want to tell corel you are activating by phone not by internet connection..

1. Start setup/install after unzipping the files
2. When the program asks for trial serial, start keygen and enter the serial under field ""already have trial serial""
3. DO NOT close or regenerate the serial in keygen.
4. Start program after installation
5. Click on ""Enter activation"" - do not click ""buy""
6. Click activate by phone. When program asks for key, enter the serial earlier entered
7. In the keygen enter the number generated by Corel as installation code
8. Click Activate (DO NOT click generate)
9. Enter the activation code manually. Sounds goofy but wouldn't work by cut and paste.
10. Click on Continue and cross fingers.

If it doesn't work, uninstall and start over. Good luck!

I didn't download this torrent but the way I did it actually works."
,RealDeal33,2008-10-08T07:55Z,"As of 10/7/08, absolutely works. I copied the serial number from the keygen with no spaces. Then the product installs. Then when I got to activation, the ""continue"" button didn't enable when I copied and pasted the Activation Code. I had to backspace the last number in the code and retype it. Then it worked. Follow the instructions and it will work. FILE HAS NO VIRUSES. I checked using updated PC Tools 2009."
,doingitwell,2010-06-15T02:02Z,"Follow the directions as greenbile mentioned or open the txt file ""Install"" after extraction and read that. Worked 100% for me on the first try. TY UL"
,to4d,2011-09-23T23:33Z,"Windows 7 trick:
Must ""run as administrator"" on application's first run.  THEN it will give you the request code for the activator.  Had to play with it a little, but finally got it to work after this. "
