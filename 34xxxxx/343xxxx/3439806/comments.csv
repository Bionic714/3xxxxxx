,pursewarden,2006-04-16T23:56Z,"Hi, I downloades all the files (it took me a week with uTorrent), but are unable to open or install them., When I double click the tda-cs2a.bin file on CD1, Stuffit runs and after clicking Expand I get the following error message:
Unknown archive format. Archive: C:Documents and Settings....DownloadsADOBE.CREATIVE.SUITE.PREMIUM.EDITION.V2.0-TDACD1tda-cs2a.bin
Engine Error: Unknown format

What am I doing wrong? "
,pursewarden,2006-04-17T12:52Z,"Ok, I finally got it and burned the disks on Nero. The problem: After installing Disk 1 of the Creative Suite, it asks for Disk 2 and won't accept it.
I had to install it separatelly from the disk since the Suite Installer wouldn't.
Why would this happen?"
,sokkopollo,2006-04-17T22:00Z,"I'm feeling really stupid here.
So, I've downloaded whole thing and I'm using Alcohol 120% to ""create"" cd without burning it for real. I see .cue files and so on, but for some reason CD1 isn't working. It opens the Adobe Creative Suite 2 window, but after that it shouts error. What am I doing wrong? Help me. ;__;"
,sokkopollo,2006-04-17T22:35Z,And one more question! What's the thing with that zip-file?! What is it for? :O God. I am stupid. :D
,Mats1962,2006-04-18T17:46Z,"Hi, anyone else got problem with activating Photoshop? I got error message saying i have written the wrong code."
,blackaudio,2006-04-21T07:16Z,"hey guys, do Not do the update download after installing the suite.  It will shut down your activation and request another ""repair"" activation for which this keygen doesn't work.  Looks like adobe made this one.

anybody find the new key algms post it please"
,lulaleila78,2006-04-21T10:33Z,"Hi,

I would like to know if the help menù is working for the Adobe illustrator tool, thanks!!"
,AURAMAXIMUS,2006-07-15T06:41Z,Does anyone have the code to unlock the bonus video in Total Trainning CS2 One-on-One?  Would greatly appreciate it.
,dj_komodo,2006-08-10T04:26Z,"Engelsk eller svensk version? Translation, is this the english or swedish version?"
,debel70,2006-08-20T17:58Z,How do I activate?
,Uhuh,2006-08-22T22:54Z,its great seeing 80 people downloading with only 4 people uploading... thanks guys for keeping these torrents alive (jackasses)
,macumming,2006-09-11T06:38Z,"Every program that is included works fine.

The crack is on the first CD.  Generate a serial number using the Key Generator, install programs, choose telephone activation, copy and paste the authorization code it gives you into the Key Generator then copy and paste the generated number into the final screen of the installation."
,nefrit,2006-09-11T19:00Z,"question..
I have installed all cd´s as virtual drives on ALcohol 120%. When I insall it still asks for the 2 CD. Even if I put the cd nr 2 in the first virtual drive it wont accept it. Any ideas?"
,eltandborste,2006-09-19T14:06Z,where do i find the serialnumber? am i stupid or what? :D
,D_theman,2006-09-23T09:19Z,i´m having problems when i shold install it whit deamon tools.. The installation don´t start.. how shold i do it.. ?? Please answer need this program for school..
,allskrewedup,2006-10-02T21:55Z,"I cant get this to work, where is the crack? when i am trying to mount cd1 only the installer comes up. And when i am installing it cant find cd2? "
,Norden_AN,2006-10-03T00:25Z,What is the serielnumber?
,Battu,2006-10-10T09:33Z,"Very very very nice!!!! Just installed ps, illust, indesign and acrobat. Activation worked very good. So far so very good.
Didn't work with the programs yet, but they did open, so i will test them now. No virusses detected yet. Gonne do some scans this evening.
Thanks very much for the torrent!!

@ All: You cant install the complete suite, install the programms seperatly, that works very well. Use the generater for Key to install, then do
activate => error: Phone activation => put the activation number you get in the lower part of the generater and generate => put this number in the activation code and you'r good!

Bye and thanks again."
,ingelah,2006-10-17T14:39Z,"Please Help!!! How to install--
How do I open a file that has .exe as a suffix?
What is the serialnumbers for the applications in CS2 particular indesign 2
With Love to anybody that answers?"
,SpaceCadetMarko,2006-10-19T03:06Z,Downloaded and installed perfectly. I used the serial and activation key generator in CD 1. Didn't bother with the substitute exe and the original works fine. The suite even updated itself from the Adobe website. Sweet. One day I may buy this software...
,RapidRun,2006-11-01T21:14Z,"ingelah: .exe is an executable. You don't need a program to open it. It is a program itself. Check the folder ""CRACK"" in the first cd image. There you will find the keygen with all the serials and activation codes.

nefrit: I had a similar problem with deamon tools. I just canceled the installation and started over using only one virtual cd-rom device and mounted all the images on that one sequantially during installation. Worked out fine."
,JuhaT,2006-11-02T18:40Z,"I don´t get it, i can mount every other cd´s but cd 1, and that´s where the crack is. when i try to mount cd 1, it says Error: .\Autoplay\LangData\fi_FI\lang.dat and after that Error: DATA_FILE_VERSION, does anybody know how to solve this problem?"
,Windowsvista,2006-11-15T11:54Z,"Thanks a lot!!

i seed two moore weeks!"
,joanp,2006-11-19T23:23Z,"Hi All!

I would recommend downloading this:

http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3347874/ADOBE_CS2_PREMIUM_EDITION_TDA_Repack_to_DVD

instead as this is the same TDA distribution but does not have the additional (and unnecessary for non-Russians) 300+ MB bloat of the Russian edition of Photoshop.  

That one needs more seeders!"
,6PYHO(bruno),2006-11-21T00:36Z,Thanks for your upload !!! Too bad 1000nds of people are bothering others with their problems while activating...you suck...all your qeustions have been answered at least a 1000nd +1 times...just call the f*cking number :P
,6PYHO(bruno),2006-11-21T00:38Z,and by the way 'joanp' you can just choose not to download the russian fotoshop in your torrentdownloader...no need to upload a new torrent...you suck
,BigDaddyKane,2006-11-28T03:26Z,"Awesome Torrent. However how do you get the ""Activation Request Code""?"
,silentwombat,2006-12-04T05:31Z,"Having some trouble here.  in each folder there is a .bin file and a .cue file.  In the instructions it says unrar/burn/install.  are the .bin file extensions a cd image file??? and if that is the case, what burning software should i use?  I have nti and it doesnt recognize either extension as a cd image file.  Am I retarded???"
,Zinedin,2006-12-23T14:54Z,Is there a way to enable swedish language later on?... anyone? It there any additional language pack I can download?
