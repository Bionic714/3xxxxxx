,thronfun47,2006-01-30T00:51Z,"SpinRite now brings its legendary data recovery and drive maintenance magic to the latest file systems, operating systems, and hard drives. It runs MUCH faster than ever before, can help maintain all of your drives in tip top shape, can warn of impending disaster, and wrestle data from dying and nearly dead drives . . . before it's too late.

SpinRite 6.0 is now available for immediate  upgrade, and download. This industry-standard data recovery tool is operating system independent, so it can be applied by users of Windows XP, 2000, Linux, and all other Intel/AMD PC?platform hard drives and file systems"

,darkassain,2008-10-25T20:08Z,this not only includes the prog but also the iso so you can burn it to a CD/DVD (dvd is probably overkill) and an image file for floppy disk...
