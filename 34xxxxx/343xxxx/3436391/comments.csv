,canoli99,2009-04-14T06:14Z,"Thank you to whoever is seeding this, I really appreciate it!

If you can keep it open, or if anyone can join this one lone seeder...I will certainly return the favor by uploading at least 1:1.

Thanks again! This and Mindwalk are my two favorite movies."

Also some leechers from different trackers, so hard to control. Ah well, hope my patience get's payed up somehow.

Anyways, this is one hell of a movie. Starts off a bit boring, but once it gets started, interesting!
Reminded me a bit of the movies by Richard Linklater."
