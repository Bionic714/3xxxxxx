[b]Description/Info:[/b]

Expanding on the hook-laden songcraft of their eponymous debut, the Ben Folds Five turn in 

another glitzy array of Todd Rundgren-esque, piano-driven pop on their second album, 

Whatever and Ever Amen. Though it isn't as consistently tuneful and clever as their first 

record, Whatever and Ever Amen has a snazzy sense of popcraft -- the hooks of "The Battle of 

Who Could Care Less," "Brick," and "Fair" sink in nearly as effortlessly as Billy Joel, 

Elton John, or Joe Jackson -- which makes the record enjoyable ear candy. Occasionally, 

Folds' smug humor -- whether it's the alternative rock skewering of "The Battle" or the 

borderline misogynist humor of "Song for the Dumped" -- can undercut his melodic gifts, but 

Whatever and Ever Amen is confirmation that the showy pop pleasures of his first record were 

no fluke.
