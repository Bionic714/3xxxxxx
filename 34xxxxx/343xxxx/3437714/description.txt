MobyGames Description
---------------------
You are a silencer, the elite of the elite soldiers of World Economic Consortium. You are used to orders of hunting down the Resistance, a ragtag band of rebels committing sabotage and other acts of terrorism against the WEC, but slowly, you realized the WEC is not quite what it appears to be... Then one day you and two other Silencers, your best buddies, were ambushed by a WEC mech patrol when it was supposed to be a routine mission. You alone survived. It is clear that the Silencer is being silenced... And the only place to turn is the Resistance... 

Torrent/Game Information

Found on eDonkey with luck. This is Crusader: No Remorse v1.01;. Full ISO in RAR archive. Two patches that I know of are available for this game: The 1.01 to 1.21 version updater and Sound Patch. You may find them at the Cyberion Systems website listed in the Links section below. If needed, I'll upload it somewhere for AGC. There's also a DOS Environment Package V1.2 available at the Cyberion Systems site. I haven't tested it, but you may try it at your leisure. Check out the AGC-readme_(cru1).txt file for more info.
