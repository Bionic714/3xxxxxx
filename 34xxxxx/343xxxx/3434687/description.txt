Ok, i just completed my tests on this program and it seams to be working very good on both unix and windows so here it is! A program to filter your ROM collection, just run it and it will clean your collection so only the good ROMS remain..

Read the ReadMe.txt if u need some help running it or just post here for any suggestions or questions. You can also visit http://www.euroemu.net/forum where i hang most of the time for any questions.

the default Filter is this:
(J) (C) (A) (F) (G) (S) (I) [p [o [a [b [t [f [T [h

but u can ofcourse use the program with your own settings...
