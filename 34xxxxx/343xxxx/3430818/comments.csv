,asdfasdfasdf2,2006-03-22T22:30Z,Can someone reseed this?
,Spindleweed,2006-10-17T23:28Z,"Desperately needs a reseed, i need the last 1%!"
,Spindleweed,2006-10-18T21:55Z,"K, i have about 100+ episodes from this torrent, its left on 98.9% with no seeds.  I will gladly leave my side open, but please can everyone try to get the OP to reseed?

(some are poor quality, but since most early recordings got destroyed, beggars can't be choosers. Most are excellent.)"
,chubbyspandex,2007-01-31T13:40Z,"Reseed requested for this torrent please.
Need a champ to help this one get going again.
Cheers"
