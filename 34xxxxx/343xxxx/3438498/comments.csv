,Berserkr,2006-02-01T01:29Z,Nice of you to tell that to the rest of us that this isn´t a dvd! We wouldn´t have found out otherwise!

,Berserkr,2006-02-01T08:24Z,I know that! I just think it´s fun to see how quick people are to correct others misstakes! Why bother?
[T],DasBot,2006-02-01T17:16Z,Because there are categories! Otherwise we can start upload games in the movies category...
,Berserkr,2006-02-01T18:54Z,Of course everyone should uload in the right category! I just just think it´s fun to see who wins the competition to be the first to make the complain! we are about a million that doesn´t care about it.
