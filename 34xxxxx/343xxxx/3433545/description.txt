Mix set of detroit techno by DJ Rolando, producer of the classic track "Knights of the Jaguar", also included in this mix. Released on Underground Resistance, the best techno label in the world - all tracks are UR releases or UR related. Live mix - no studio bullshit, you can hear Rolando nudging the vinyl to correct the beat mix. Sound varies from hard as fuck to wonderfully melodic - but funky as hell, all the way. Mustn't be missed. Enjoy, always fight the majors, stay low, stay underground, transmit these tones and wreak havoc on the programmers!

From Submerge:
"The Aztec Mystic Mix" showcases the Latino avenger's skills behind the decks and in the studio as he spins four of his own tracks into a seamless set of old and new tunes from UR, 430 West, Red Planet and other Motor City imprints. From the quirky disco of Dark NRG's "Witchdokta" to the ragged electro of Drexciya's "Bata Pumps" and the joyous synth stabs of Suburban Knight's "Midnite Sunshine," Rolando's set explores the diversity of Detroit's lesser-known producers. Besides the atmospheric intro, the only departure from rhythmic intensity is UR's "Metamorphosis," a languorous interlude sandwiched between the chainsaw funk of "Short Circuits" and the gorgeous melody of Mad Mike's "Illuminator."
