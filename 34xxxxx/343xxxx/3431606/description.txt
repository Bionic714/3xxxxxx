The touring year opened with the band feeling relaxed and eager to stretch the boundaries. Believe the Lie is one of the newest additions to the UM repertoire, is and an example of the band's use of "Jimmy Stewarts" to write new songs. The chorus initially appeared as an improvisation during Der Bluten Kat from 02.11.04. Debuting on 02.16.05, it has quickly become a crowd pleaser. Also featured, the improvisation in the "Jimmy Stewart" (02.18.05) as well as the second half of Nothing Too Fancy (02.16.05) show the band's ability to create wave upon wave of momentum to drive the crowd into a veritable frenzy.

The band's week long tour through the south yielded some gem "Jimmy Stewarts" that everyone should check out. Each of the three "Stewarts" in this episode are of the rare lyrical variety. The Atlanta and Knoxville "Stewarts" could easily be confused as songs to the untrained listener. The Pearl Jam-tinged Birmingham "Stewart" is a nice treat for the children of the 90s in us all. The explanation of the title for Miss Tinkle's Overture gives us at least a little bit of insight into the band's song naming conventions (unconventional as they are). For those unfamiliar with the "Jimmy Stewart," be sure to check out this write-up.

Here is a collection of tunes from Jam in the Dam. The band was loose, relaxed, and very playful. All of the bands were having a blast; you can hear the mutual respect among the artists during the Keller Williams and Charlie Hitchcock sit-ins. To close out this collection of tunes is the Roulette from their triumphant return to The Riviera, a few highlights. You can feel the band and the crowd feeding off each other's energy.

Umphrey's McGee likes Led Zeppelin. If the influence wasn't apparent to you, maybe this podcast will help you out. They just seemed to be busting out major Zeppelin passages over the first few weeks of April, so here they are. Lots of exploratory segments in this Podcast, that give a better feel for what the band does when they stretch the limits of a song. 


Ill put the podcasts up in groups of five after they have been taken off of the Umphrey's website.

Enjoy
