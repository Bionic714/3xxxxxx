In DK they are called ""Pirat-gruppen"". By ""visitet"" I meen ones pc will do things that it wasnt meant to do. Watch out for updates from microsoft some of theme are killing downloaded music."
,acuario21,2007-04-05T14:53Z,"This is a crazy torrent to me, the best way to find this episodes is this:

www.s-torm.com   , the best site in town, believe me!:)"
,sazismail,2007-06-08T22:00Z,"Holy shit dude... thats sum massive torrent, i saw him live the other week in Bahrain..and love his tunes... god knows how many weeks this will take tho... but if i get it, i'll seed it for as long as my network will let me :-)"
,aussiebeast,2007-06-17T08:33Z,"This might help you all complete you collections!!!

This site has EVERY Armin ASOT broadcast!!!

http://qsound.ru/music.php?id=932881&artist=Armin%20Van%20Buuren

I know it's in Russian, but...
- click the ASOT you want.
- click ??????? in the next window
- then to download the file, click the link at the bottom left of the next window.

Unfortunately this site limits non-members to 1 parallel download at a time, and there is a download limit too, I think it's 2Gb. 

If all Armin ASOT fans grab batches and then offer them as torrents we can get them faster :)

If you do grab them, please seed them for those struggling to find the older ASOT"
,aussiebeast,2007-06-17T08:35Z,"In my previous comment, the ??????? was supposed to be Russian text pasted from the site. 

There is a section of text on the 2nd window, and there is a link in the middle of the page under that... click it to get the 3rd window up.

And it's 2Gb per day per IP address."
,topbob,2007-07-11T09:13Z,"I'm at 50% while I write this. After I finish this torrent and finish the ton of downloads from that Russian site, I will upload a complete torrent of the missing torrents up to the most current."
