,MaximRecoil,2006-02-01T07:02Z,"It seems to me that the search engine here is only searching through the torrent description, and completely ignoring the title. A torrent with no description is completely invisible to the search engine, and one with a description that doesn't repeat words from the title is unlikely to be found by anyone.

It doesn't make any sense. There must be thousands of torrents on here that no one will ever be able to find by searching. "
