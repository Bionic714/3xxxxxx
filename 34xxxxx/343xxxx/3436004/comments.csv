,chevron,2006-03-30T18:53Z,"This doesn't work, it keeps saying that there is no map info available. I just copied the contents on an empty 512MB MMC card.
Also doesn't work when I copy the contents of an original card on the empty card. I think it is secured in some way, does anybody know how to crack it?"
