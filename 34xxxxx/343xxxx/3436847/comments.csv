,BandofBuccaneers,2006-01-28T21:46Z,some of you guys are freakin idionts. apparently you didnt read the torrent downloads. OF COURSE ITS A TS DVD-R! it says so! lol wow. and you gus are complaining about me!
,ympanson,2006-01-28T21:48Z,i hope its gonna be batter seeding in the future.=)
[V],robbie1412,2006-01-28T23:33Z,"Well band of Buccaners, if it is a Ts dvdr , put in ure fracking description, it only says Dvd-r , write ts dvdr u lameass fucktard... dont call us idiots. Head back to school"
,BandofBuccaneers,2006-01-28T23:39Z,"If this doesnt tell you what you need to know, you must be of your rocker... I wrote: ""This is the maVen release of Underworld Evolution that has been color corrected, audio remastered and placed in a DVD environment with Menus and Chapter Selection."" I cant make it any clearer than that."
,BandofBuccaneers,2006-01-29T01:18Z,The torrent site i have originally uploaded this to is almost done and we will come here to help you guys out. dont know how long they will stay but just keep your eyes open

,peacemakerzx,2006-01-29T01:40Z,How much faster will it be? Cuz rite now it's going anywhere from 0b/s to 100b/s lol
,BandofBuccaneers,2006-01-29T01:47Z,there will be 15-20 people most pulling anywhere from 70-150 kilobytes/sec. the reason you are pulling down so slow is because there are 400 of you and only one of me.
,peacemakerzx,2006-01-29T02:10Z,"alright, theres nothing i can do right?"
,Armind,2006-01-29T02:16Z,keep up the good WORK !! SEED AS MUCH AS YOU CAN !

"
,BandofBuccaneers,2006-01-29T17:30Z,stay with it guys. it will be worth it i promise.
[V],robbie1412,2006-01-29T19:23Z,"agree... missingxtension..

Very noobish..

He says its a ts dvdr , but still remastered it will not be a good dvdr "
,BandofBuccaneers,2006-01-29T19:33Z,"noobish because your standards for a noob (look at my profile this is my first torrent here. DVD-R means its an iso that can be burned. Remastered it will be a good DVD-R. So dont fucking judge what you dont know. You all are so preoccupied with running your mouths you have no time to just look at what has been given to you. I have been in the film industry for 5 years and I know how to remaster things. But wait, someone might say that I should have put that in my description. Who knows? And a TS DVD-R can be good. You have just never run into anyone who knows what the hell they are doing. You all are so unforgiving and unknoledgeable. This is the result of an open torrent site that anyone can join. A bunch of assholes sign up. Here I am offering something to you and the only thing you can find to do is criticise it. Maybe if TPB allowed edits i could change my OP. But they dont offer that here. Quality control.... because God forbid someone make a mistake on their first torrent on a site... Wow. Where is the sense of community. I see none."
,Brado,2006-01-29T20:14Z,"BoB, fuck robbie1412.  Good shit on ur release, your patience with this crowd and for sharing this!! I appreciate YOU helping ME out.  For fucks sake people, is this man SELLING you something?  Does he owe u a debt?  
No, he deserves our thanks, so work on that gratitude.

And once again, thanks Team BoB!  D/l'ing right now and looking forward to next release.  "

,missingxtension,2006-01-30T06:41Z,"What app r u using to seed? is it azerous? ive had problems with azerous. To begin with it runs on java witch is not a very efficient in memory or hardware, dont believe me? check your cpu/disk usage with azerous and compare it to bitcoment. and i dont remember a single post where someone said they were ungreatfull but in the future keep in mind that most post absept html code so u can link to http://www.vcdquality.com/ or even link pics."
,missingxtension,2006-01-30T06:45Z,"by the way for more info check out this link for the original maven release http://www.vcdreview.com/info.php/i-58433.html
and heres some pics

,BandofBuccaneers,2006-01-30T07:17Z,"missingxtension, none of the pics on VCD Quality do this DVD justice. Thats why i didnt post them myself. The description is that of a COLOR CORRECTED and AUDIO REMASTERED copy of maVen's release. It is not the same quality or color or audio there was before. To post those pics is wrong and misleading for this release."
,ympanson,2006-01-30T08:43Z,how do u help seeding?
[V],robbie1412,2006-01-30T12:56Z,"Got to carried away , sorry. Last days have been shit .. and it was wrong of me to let my frustration affect u .. sorry .. Preciate ure effort"

,BandofBuccaneers,2006-01-30T17:44Z,"@ympanson: im not sure what you are asking.

@airona: No there are no subtitles. Unless you wanted me to type them all out for you there are no subs in any language. And it's in english (not the subs, the movie) I'm sorry man."

,Muffen2,2006-02-01T10:29Z,"yea I finished and I'm seeding now, only going to keep it running for another 6 - 7 hours though, but hopefully more will finish in that time..."
,Muffen2,2006-02-01T10:41Z,"just checked out the quality and I think you did a great job! The picture is really good, not as good as a DVD release but still very acceptable!

The sound isnt the best but its not a problem either, and I think this is by far the best release of this movie so far!

Good job :)"
,kimjo,2006-02-01T10:43Z,Dont botter.. This is a crappy cam movie. The entire movie is blury... BoB sucks..

,BandofBuccaneers,2006-02-03T00:51Z,"Hey. Not my fault if you dont like the quality. You were told what it was before you downloaded it. Yes, it is the same release, but the color correction is essential to a good movie experience. The colors are right. The blacks are back instead of grey, the blues are rich blue and all the colors are corrects as they can be. As good as maven is, its not as good as what I have made it. If you cant see the difference in the maVen screenies and mine, you are blind."
