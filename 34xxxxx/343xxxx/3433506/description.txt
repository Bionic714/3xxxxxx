Is necessary comments?  I don't think so. but...
Islamics accuse us of making atrocites against Arab.
And I find well to be pursued to who make it. States 
ask for forgiveness if it is necessary.

when will they request pardon the Islamic ones for 
their massacres?
Has somebody listened at some time that they pursue
the genocidists?
From the slaughters in Palestine for Ami Al Hussein,
Arafat's uncle and leader of the Muslim Brothers Siblings
up to Sudan, going by the slaughters made for albano-Kosovar... 
Neither a Muslim single state has requested pardon its crimes.
Is it not necessary to pursue the criminals in the Arab world?
We should condemn them and to pursue them with the same 
forcefulness and with the same loathing that provokes us.

They are authentic crimes against the humanity.
