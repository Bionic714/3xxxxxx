,yamadron,2007-06-13T04:51Z,"Hi Guys , I am sorry to tell u that the game isn't working for me on ePSXe Emulator. Plus in The .rar file ,the game name is Bust A ""MOVE"" NOT "" GROOVE"".On the other hand, I have found the game on other sites and more larger that this file in .rar too"
,Gosu09,2007-12-20T00:18Z,"I downloaded this and it works and to this person:

yamadron: Plus in The .rar file ,the game name is Bust A ""MOVE"" NOT "" GROOVE"".

Of course it's ""Bust a Move"" and not ""Bust a Groove"" because the Japanese version was originally called ""Bust a Move"" with of course other versions being called ""Bust a groove""

,donkatsu,2008-01-26T16:03Z,"i tried burning the .iso file with dvd decrypter and cd writing wizard but both were not able to work on my  modded ps2.  the 2nd time, i used cd writing wizard and my ps2 was able to read the cd-r disc, but after selecting the cd icon, screen would turn black for few seconds and then return to same menu.  anybody know a solution for this? thanks"
,deemzeemz,2008-05-15T10:34Z,"Download and works perfectly in ePSXe. Will seed for as long as I have space on my computer. The only problem I encountered was the lack of music, which can be fixed by enabling XA sound in sound config. Thank you so much for this!!"
