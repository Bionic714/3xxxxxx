Documentary/Film by/with The Incredible String Band,
still at their peak (well, allmost) 

(they got crappy soon afterwards, never again to come close to the same *Magic* feeling!)

I riped the DVD (Wienerworld version) using dvd decrypter.
No CSS or Region code...
This is a 1:1 copy (uncompressed) 
The box (well, a pice of paper inside the box) said that this is a NTSC disc,
though I thought I was  getting the PAL version from Amazon (uk); thats what the site says anyway.... http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005TO32/qid=1138905537/sr=8-2/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i2_xgl/203-8207215-8962300

Anyway anyway the image quality could have been better, and the whole DVD is interlaced (yuk! why do they do that?) so i guess i does not matter much

this is it anyway 
enjoy:)
