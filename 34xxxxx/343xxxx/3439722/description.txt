Peter Bardens of Camel joined Alan Parsons Project regulars Colin Blunstone, Ian Bairnson, David Paton, and Stuart Elliott to form the one-project band Keats. The album Keats is one of the best Project-related projects and one of the best kept Project-related secrets. Blunstone's voice soars from beginning to end. "Heaven Knows" and "Tragedy" provide a strong start. "How Can You Walk Away" resembles Ammonia Avenue's "Dancing on a Highwire." In general, the group sounds like a subdued version of Kansas, and is more song-oriented than Project art-rock.
