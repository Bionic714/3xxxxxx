,UncleFester,2006-01-16T03:50Z,"Hello: Just wondering if this was English or Swedish?

Cheers and TA! 
Be Seeing You!"
[V],weaver73,2006-01-16T09:07Z,"It's English. I don't think OED ever will be published in Swedish, 'cause that would be quite a pain-in-the ass-job to do :)"
,Metonomy,2006-01-16T12:10Z,weaver73: Do You know if there are any differences between this and the existing:  http://thepiratebay.org/details.php?id=3338705
[V],weaver73,2006-01-16T14:18Z,"Metonomy: I don't think there's any difference. My torrent is a bit smaller and consists of two ISO files made from two CD ROMS that work on my comp.

It's important to save the second disc since OED will use it every third month for authentication. 

Anyway, use the information described in the comments of that other torrent if you encounter any probs.

I have no problems using my ISO files with daemon."
,eddiedrago,2006-11-04T00:08Z,"Can't seem to get it to authenticate with either disk inserted. Anyone else have the same issue?
"
[V],weaver73,2006-11-07T22:18Z,"Try to mount the second disc(image) using daemon tools, that works for me."
,razur,2007-10-08T22:23Z,"Oxford English Dictionary 
Second Edition 
Version 3.0
is shareware the authetication was omitted delibartly."
,ngawuraje,2008-01-12T03:41Z,"so far it works flawlessly. I installed it fully, so I don't need to mount the disc image on daemon tools.
If you got problems installing it, perhaps your antivirus blocked some process, so you might try installing it without logging on to the net and pausing your AV.
MANY THANKS TO YOU WEAVER73. YOUR THE BEST :D"
,FRANKISAURUS,2008-01-27T02:23Z,I really appreciate the upload....I'm truly bummed that it tells me after I install it that it is not compatible with the vista operating system.  Thanks nevertheless.
,monkeystuff68,2008-03-01T13:38Z,"I downloaded the two files, ran them from daemon emulator AND, alternatively, tried to run the program using actual CDs. I just can't get past the authentification window, and the program won't run. 

I tried to follow the suggestions offered by smurfette on another torrent http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3252097/Oxford_English_Dictonary_2nd_Edition_(v1.14)

but, to be honest, were not sure what to do with the downloaded files: there were only a few of them, and none seemed to have the *.img extension.

If someone has figured out how to bypass these issues and get the program to operate, I am sure there are many here who would appreciate.

As for me, I am an advanced user, but no wizard! 

thanks for any CLUES!"
,secher,2008-03-31T13:49Z,Is there a way to get this to have a smaller RAM footprint so I can leave it up as a seed?
,secher,2008-03-31T13:50Z,What are the error messages you're getting?
,N0B0d7kn0Ze,2008-06-04T09:56Z,"This program won't run on Windows Vista Ultimate SP1 (32-bit).

I try to open the program, and I get a small window with a title bar saying:  ""LMS Install Wait Screen,"" and a dialog box saying:  ""Please wait while the C-Dilla Licence Management System is installed...""

Then I get an error message which says:
 ""(1611:1) The product will not run on this operating system.""

Then, the program quits.

I'll try it on my Windows XP machine and see if it works any better.

I'll get back to you and let you know, (in case anyone is interested)."
,N0B0d7kn0Ze,2008-06-04T11:00Z,"Further to my previous comment, the program works fine on Windows XP.  It will not work on Windows Vista."
,snapbee,2008-09-25T15:21Z,"^^re: Vista, have you tried using the compatibility mode, setting it to run as if it were Windows XP?  You can reach compatibility settings by right-clicking on the exe--->properties--->compatibility.  I don't think that the temporary change is total and a lot of programs will be fooled by this, although some won't."
,nhatuan,2009-07-20T15:56Z,"i'm using vista 32bit too, and it didn't work :("
,jh3141,2010-09-13T23:37Z,This version won't run on vista or win7.  The copy protection system isn't compatible; you need v3.1.1 at least to work on these systems.
