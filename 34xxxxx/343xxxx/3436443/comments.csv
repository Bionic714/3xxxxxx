,RS diehard,2007-01-08T14:29Z,"Thanks a bunch! I love this game, haven't played in years. Words are insifficient to describe my happiness. :D

I'll seed, for like, ever too, I'm good for that. DL better finish.. 

Note: To open .cue .bin .iso files there are several ways to do it. I've heard burning it to a CD works, but I just use DAEMON tools and mount it on a virtual drive. Makes it think it's in a CD-ROM drive and then you can open it. Usually it'll be a .zip or .rar file, so that it can have all files of whatever you're downloading shown as one. Like in this instance. "
,xXHustlerXx,2007-02-03T19:57Z,"I still can't play the game, I mounted it with DAEMON tools and that worked - so far - Then i open it, and click on play game, so i click, the button just goes in and out but nothing happens, i know i have a VERY good graphics and soundcard, but nothing happens, HELP!! 

Sorry, so? I'm kind of a noob, Once again we all were once :) 

Thanks in advance!

P.S All the other programs on the file runs correctly, only as i try to actually PLAY the game, it does NOT work..  what should i do?"
,addepower,2007-02-04T19:22Z,seed pls^^ :)

I am opened rainbowsixroguespear.cue that with Daemon Tool
But there is not ""Install Rogue spear""
just ""play rogue spear, uninstall rogue spear, configure rogue spear etc... BUT NO INSTALL WTF?"
,r0tt3n,2008-04-10T09:45Z,"I just finished downloading this, mounted it, and everything looked normal - had the ""Install Rogue Spear"" button pop up right away... the ""Play Rogue Spear"" button was greyed out - not sure why everyone else is having trouble - this looks a-ok to me!

Thanks Weuler Junior!"
,zorkd,2008-07-05T04:57Z,"I am so happy i found this! works fine, i burned it to a CD and its just like having the original.  i installed nato3 mod from ARMM and i'm all set."
,Droog_Kaasje,2008-08-06T08:58Z,"!!!!
It's not working for me either... I've installed and reinstalled the game a few times, even downloaded a patch, but it still does NOT work. 

I also tried the compatibility mode (tried to run under Windows '95  and '98 compatibility) but didn't help a bit neither. 

But no problems with the installation.

The button 'Config Rogue Spear' does work though, but I can't play the game. When I click the start-up button for the game ('Play Rogue Spear') I get an error. 

Some help would really be appreciated!"
