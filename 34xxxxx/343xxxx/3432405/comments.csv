At least the 3 first tracks..c now diabolical, K.I.N.G. and The pentagramm burns"
,dwar,2006-10-15T11:55Z,"It's just different that the earlier style of Satyricon.
I'm a bit ambivalent about Now Diabolical, as they are moving more towards thrash than bm, but I wouldn't call it bad as such."
,avtonom,2006-11-25T19:05Z,"Nån som har Isengard-albumet, lägg ut och seeda!"

,sotiricon,2006-12-22T15:49Z,"about satyricon,their 3 1st albums in norway costs 165 crowns,the 3 last,such as rebel,volcano,diabolical costs 109 nok,so this tells it all.i saw them live,the new songs are endless with pointless and childish riffs i was playin when i was 12 yrs old.remember that this is the same band that released Nemesi Divina!!! unbelievable!!!"
,sotiricon,2006-12-22T15:51Z,"and by the way they dont sound like thrash at all,i wish they were!"

,mastersturm,2007-12-21T01:27Z,Oppi Fjellet has always been one of the most ideal songs to join in on while grasping a stein.  In-The-Tavern-Before-We-Go-A-Viking Metal.
,dundun80,2008-01-04T01:13Z,seeda....... please
,Mysticum81,2008-04-04T09:04Z,"This is a great album, which really captures something essential about being Scandinavian. Another such band, although not very metal, is the Danish ""Sorten Muld"" - They, too, have taken ancient music and updated it with modern instruments...check it out! :)"
,Turbidblue,2008-05-31T22:14Z,Tusen tack! Hittade den här när jag letade efter skivor med 3rd And The Mortal (ingen som har? =/ tappat bort mina) och blev positivt överraskad! =)
