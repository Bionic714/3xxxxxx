,eskofot,2006-01-28T23:24Z,"Thanks a lot. There's been many uploads of v1.7, but none of them working, all of them wanted to be activated via internet ;o)"
,eskofot,2006-01-28T23:33Z,"And funny... This one has same name/serial as the other three torrents of this prg, but this one actually works. MANY thanks :o)
"
,angma,2006-02-11T11:31Z,"Works GREAT!!!.... However... these software creators are some NASTY sons of bi...ches. DO NOT CLICK ON ANY OF THE ""MORE INFORMATION"" links in the proggy! It will shutdown your system and the program will delete itself... luckily your OS should be back up and running with no problems. "
,Pomidoroff,2006-02-24T03:11Z,"I forgot I shouldn't click on More Information, I clicked, the program deleted itself, now I can't reinstall it. I've searched the registry and the hard-drive for any traces ('xplite' and 'litepc') and removed those, still can't reinstall. So whatever you do, DON'T CLICK ON 'MORE INFORMATION'."
,citizenr,2006-03-03T10:55Z,"If its allready ""too late"" and XPLite wants to ""confirm the license"" just shut it down and delete this file :

C:Documents and Settings""your account name""NTUSER.ini

""your account name"" = enter here youur user accounts name of course :]

Got this using Sysinternals filemonitor :))
