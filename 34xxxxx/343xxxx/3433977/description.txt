Product Detail:

Unsolved History is history the way it was! Through detailed examination of archaeological and forensic evidence, existing photographs, authentic artifacts, and carefully selected interviews from eyewitnesses and experts ? events are reconstructed and historical questions are finally answered.

On July 20, 1944 ? one year before the fall of Nazi Germany ? members of Hitler's General Staff detonated a bomb in a briefing hut in an attempt to kill their leader. The bombing was meant to lead to the overthrow of the Third Reich and bring about a glorious, early end to the war. But despite careful plotting and precise execution, the plan was a failure.

Learn what went wrong with the scheme to assassinate Hitler, who was standing just a few feet away from the explosion. Explore the bomb-resistant construction of the briefing hut and learn why the conference was moved from Hitler's bunker ? a more typical location. See how the unusually warm weather played a crucial role in minimizing damage from the explosion ? windows that would've been shut remained open, alleviating pressure from the explosion. And, hear the story of how a simple oak dining table may have been Hitler's savior that day. It's an examination of how a series of seemingly unimportant events conspired to preserve the life of one of history's most despised individuals.

This is pretty good quality but the original DVD itself wasn't the best crystal-clear source like you would find with other DVD's.  The Encoding didn't lose anything, I know that much and if it did, it was negligible.  Thanks to Warmonger for the source!
