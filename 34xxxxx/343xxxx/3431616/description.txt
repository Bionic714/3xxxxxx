[b]Description/Info:[/b]

Trust Company's major-label debut is a rather standard affair that meshes melody with aggressive vocal screams like many other acts that have sprouted since Linkin Park and Papa Roach scored big in 2000. Despite the simplistic formulas present here, these young men have patched together a sound that is catchy and eager for additional spins. Songs like "Downfall" and "Hover" capitalize in large ways on the nu-metal trend, and are extremely memorable tracks. Occasionally Trust Company slides in melodies that border on the ever-popular punk-pop genre, which helps distance the group from many of its peers. Unfortunately, while The Lonely Position of Neutral has a wealth of strong tracks, it is quite apparent that the group's similarities to Linkin Park may hurt its long-term success, as many may find the band nothing more than the expected carbon copy of other, more successful acts. This is a shame, because those willing to give this album a chance will find one of the most infectious alternative metal albums of 2002.
