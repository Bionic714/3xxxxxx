Thank,  Arturo"
,nick145276,2008-01-06T05:27Z,"The files work in MS Word. However, these are not all of the books by Tolkien about Middle Earth as you have stated. It is missing several books such as The Adventures of Tom Bombadil, The Road Goes Ever On, and Bilbo's Last Song. This torrent was created before the release of The History of The Hobbit and The Children of HĂşrin and therefore does not include them. Looking past this, you have done well of course."
,Balbo70,2009-06-16T09:00Z,Thanks nick... It was of course a test to see if anybody would spot the deliberate mistake... lol
