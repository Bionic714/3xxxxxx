StyleWriter - the World's Largest Style and Usage checker - is the world's most powerful editor. 
It plugs directly into all versions of Microsoft Word, Word Perfect or any Windows application through the Clipboard. StyleWriter searches for thousands of writing faults, including complex words, jargon and abstract words, wordy phrases, hidden verbs, passive verbs, clich?and long sentences. It then pops up advice showing you how to edit each sentence. Using StyleWriter typically cuts 25 percent of the words from the document and removes the stale writing habits so common in organizational writing. It's just like having a professional editor sit down and highlight the writing problems in any document.
