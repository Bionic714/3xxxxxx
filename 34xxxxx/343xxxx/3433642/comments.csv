,bamaboi,2008-08-08T21:52Z,Ok I downloaded this game and I did just what the fucking readme shit said and it just kept saying some bs about cant support fullscreen and then no game play... maybe you should put all the files on here or give better instructions.... i do believe i know what im doing ive been doing this for quite sometime now.... dick face
,Famulous,2008-12-17T10:22Z,"It's simple guys. I've gotten all the errors above (need page number, the full screen thing, the need cd thing). My solution was simple

Move the Warcraft file to just c:\ (it saves a ton of effort later), and then rename the file it's in to something simple and without spaces (like warcraft_1 or something).

Then, download DOSBOX (its free)

In dosbox, type (if you used the names above)
mount a c:\warcraft_1

then type
a:

and then type
SETUP.EXE

The game should run from there. As for needing the line from the manual, the manual counts EVERYTHING as a line. If you're skipping over the titles, you'll pass the line. Mine was Page one line four word four, or

GETTING STARTED
SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
Computer
Warcraft requires at least a Macintosh 68030

The first three ""Lines"" were all titles, but they're still included. The word was ""least,"" by the way.

Good luck!"
,motokox,2009-01-29T06:48Z,WARCRAFT #1 IS A DOS GAME YOU NEED THE DOS EMULATOR

,darkscythe,2009-03-27T00:45Z,Seeding file
,YarrGnome,2009-05-30T21:03Z,"This is awesome, thanks!
For people who are confused (like I was)
Run Install.exe in the folder called Warcraft 1: Orcs and Humans in side where ever you downloaded it to, and it's pretty simple from thereon in. Just be sure to use DOSbox (www.dosbox.com) to run both SETUP.EXE and WAR.EXE. You need dosbox to run war.exe correctly, but even then it won't work unless you have done SETUP.EXE from INSIDE dosbox.

Good luck fighting off orcish hordes, oldskool style :P"
,SeedsofEvil,2009-06-02T01:04Z,"Hi, hate to be annoying, got it installed just wondering how i patch it."

,ProtoZombie,2010-07-01T23:04Z,ok i installed the game. i did the setup. i read the read me and it says to unpack the patch file in the warcraft folder. i look in the warcraft folder and there is no patch. the patch file is outside of the warcraft folder and when i try to use it dosbox tells me it is an illegal command. someone just explain what im supposed to do please. if ur not going to help the people that download ur torrent then why bother uploading?
,garonw,2010-07-03T15:32Z,I installed but it is asking for a CD. What do I do?
,Bwaaa,2011-03-31T08:12Z,"It keeps telling me to insert a disk, you dn't just Unrar it, maybe some instructions would help?"
,Nemase,2011-04-19T18:49Z,"aha, so you say that i dont need cd or virtual image drive, Well why the heck does it then ask for CD whenever i try to start Single Player ?????"
,aavery93,2011-06-11T21:22Z,"This is the first thing I have ever downloaded that I can't figure out, the only problem I am having is patching. First of all it is an application, not a rar and second when I try to run it, it does nothing. I try to run it in dosbox, it does nothing. Nothing I do seems to work. I made an account on this site just to ask this question, can someone please help?"
,lward53,2011-10-12T18:15Z,"Download and install tut:

1. Goto http://www.dosbox.com/download.php?main=1  .

2. Download the one that relates to you, Mine is ""Windows""

3. install, Press next next next blah blah blah.

4. Run ""Dosbox""

5. download the torrent, save to the following ""C:\warcraft""

MISSINGSTEP: Run install.exe ""Compleetly missed that""

6. In dos type mount c c:\warcraft

7. it'll say something along the lines of C\ is mounted warcraft or something...

8. type C:   Also ""zimovshik"" "
,lward53,2011-10-12T18:18Z,"this is you're solution. :P Calm down okay =3

9. type setup

10. You'll be asked for a line from the Manuel Go find it, ""TITLES COUNT AS LINES""  EG mine said 
Word one line seven page two.

And gave me the letter hint. ""t"" Beware the 1st few pages aren't counted, the page number is located bottom right.

My answer was select-i know dosent start with a t- 

""CAREFULL it isant allways right, press alt-x followed by enter, to reset type setup to recive a new one keep repeting intill you get one thats right""

 5 mins hunting down the Manuel mine saved where i extracted the file too:P ""Sooooo C: progfiles vuzedownloads""

i had to open mine with ""Adobe reader""

11. Im not doing a tut for the sound, so for easy painlessness just pick no sound and than move on

12. Type WAR to launch the game... have fun now! =3"
,kithylin,2011-10-16T06:00Z,"For all of you people having problems installing: THIS IS A MS-DOS GAME DESIGNED TO BE RUN IN MS-DOS, NOT WINDOWS!!!!!!!!!

I do not understand why you people are so dense in understanding this.   YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE PROBLEMS RUNNING IT IN ANY VERSION OF WINDOWS BECAUSE IT IS NOT DESIGNED TO BE RUN FROM WITHIN WINDOWS.

Stop bitching about patching, and stop bitching about ""Waaaah this doesn't run for me, i can't get it to run"" unless you're actually trying it on a 486 or pentium in real-mode ms-dos.

I just burned this, renamed the patcher file to be 8.3 file-name compatible, copied it to my 486 with a floppy disk, ran it, it patched fine.  Found manual word by reading PDF with my laptop while looking at the 486 screen, works and runs flawlessly.

It's not hard people."
,ForRevGreen,2012-08-17T07:15Z,"Took a while but you just gonna know how DOS works. Also, you're gonna have to find a manual online for the game, because it asks you to find a word in the manual before you can play the game. Doesn't deserve the downvotes, the game is fine. Just blame your own inadequacy if you can't get it to run."
