,Mickau,2006-01-16T23:09Z,"I cant finish downloading this torrent. I get a wrong message claiming that ""existing data file length is to large"". Anyone know what went wrong? Its boring since I downloaded almost 3.37 GiB."
,pietsok,2006-01-17T12:25Z,Maybe your HD is full? Just guessing..
,Mickau,2006-01-17T14:28Z,"Nope, 100 Gb free space. I will check Azureus website for more iformation. This is a beautiful torrent by the way so million thanks anyway"
,2nadroj3,2006-01-17T20:24Z,"Error: ""trouble accessing files - [Errno 24] too many open files....""

Any ideas?"

,pietsok,2006-01-20T13:59Z,"I appreciate your intention to seed Mickau, this torrent is a bit too big for me to upload on my own ;)"
,Biffo,2006-01-22T12:03Z,"Mickau i) and 2nadroj3 ii)
-- i) Choose (in Azureus) Tools|Options|Files|Truncate existing files that are too large --
ii) Use Azureus or a client that limits the no. of open files -- Windows won't let you have 772 files open simultaneously."
