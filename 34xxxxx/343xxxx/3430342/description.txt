This torrent consists of two audio tapes by L. Ron Hubbard:

"Ron's Journal 67" - Made in September 1967. The tape runs approximately 40 minutes, in which Hubbard talks about various subjects, including the Sea Org and an alleged conspiracy against Scientology, orchestrated by a secret society of about a dozen men who controls all mental health groups in the world. He talks about how Scientology, however, has sent in agents against these people.

Hubbard also talks about having made a breakthrough, discovering things that "were the demise for this civilisation". He says this information is "carefully arranged to kill anyone if he discovers the exact truth of it" and that he got injured and "almost lost this body" obtaining the material. He doesn't give much details about what the information is "because it's very likely to make you sick too". What he is talking about is the story about Xenu.

"Ron's Journal 36" was made in 1982 and is a short Christmas greeting to all scientologists and a pep talk from Hubbard, although some people speculate the person on the tape may not be Hubbard but a soundalike, since Hubbard lived in hiding at this time. 

The quality of RJ67 is pretty good. I ripped RJ36 myself and the quality is so-so with some background noises.
