Included:

Multisim V8.3.30
Ultiboard V8
Ultiroute V8
Docs 
Ebooks

The last torrent I uploaded had a major error: The docs and tutorials were not included. Therefore I am uploading it again. 

If you already downloaded the other version, you can probably stick to it but remember that this torrent is the *FULL* retail suite including documentation and tutorials (the other lacks the latter so you might be better off deleting it and grabbing this one instead).

I also added some ebooks.
