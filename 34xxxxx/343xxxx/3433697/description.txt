Wesker's Report PSX

If you're a Resident Evil fan, and ya haven't seen this yet you'll luv this..

A movie made up of scenes of RE 1,2 and 3, and narrated by Albert Wesker.
Told as if it where a true report, this film gives some clarity on the events that happend in raccoon-city.

As a BONUS there's also footage of RE2 that never made the game. And the intro of the original RE uncut.

If somebody out there can provide me with a .avi or whatever of Wesker's report II.
Just put it on the bay, or PM me..
