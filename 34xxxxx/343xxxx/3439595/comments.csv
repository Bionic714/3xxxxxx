,MrJalla,2006-02-04T23:15Z,"Im having problems using this one... missing aprons/runways at several apts (notably Mexico City, Ciudad Jerez and a few more) also no AFCADs...  if anyone has any ideas I would be greatful! All the best and thks again for a otherwise nice file!"
,ksat,2006-02-05T03:59Z,I got the same problem as mrjalla none of the aporons showed exept at  mexico city international any Help i lived in mexico for a year and this scenery brings back memories 
,MrJalla,2006-02-05T12:42Z,"checked a bit more, the problem only seems to appear in the nothern airports... south ones (including Mexico City, Acapulco, Guadalahara etc) work fine except for the lack of AFCADs
wonder if the exclude library for the norh sceneries has anything to do with the problem... anyone?"
,NZ01,2007-05-23T10:57Z,"Have a look at your dir structure it should be like this [i got the original cd's]:

FM - APTMEX    - SCENERY - 286 objects
                      - TEXTURE   - 682 objects
     -MEX2004N - SCENERY - 184 objects
                      - TEXTURE - 928 objects
     -MEX2004T - SCENERY - 33 objects

There are no AF2 files as you mentioned.  They were coded into the bgl's."
,KLM1604,2007-06-12T15:33Z,"NZO1,

Can you maybe upload this files into a zip file.
So we can manual copy the files into FS2004.
Thanks for it."
