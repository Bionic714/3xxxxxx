Description:

This is not the sensationalized program aired on CBS in 1993 which depicted 
Noah's Ark protruding from the ice on Mt. Ararat. That program was later shown 
to have been based on falsified stories, myth, and bogus documents. This is 
the real Ark site!

Noah's Ark has been found. Here is the evidence, including photographs, to 
prove it. Furthermore, you can visit the site yourself, and you won't have to 
climb into a glacier to get there!

Here are the facts. It is in Turkey 17 miles from Mt. Ararat on a gentle slope 
at the 6000-foot elevation. It is a man-made object and was clearly designed 
as a boat. It incorporates principles of higher mathematics and advanced 
hydrodynamics. It contains decks and interior chambers. It is the proper 
dimension for the Ark. It is in the proper geographical location. It is 
accompanied by large, anchor stones of an appropriate size. It has been 
visited by religious pilgrims for thousands of years. It is consistent with 
the Bible, the Torah, and the ancient clay tablets from Sumer. And it is 
surrounded by mountains and villages which carry names from antiquity relating 
to the Ark's landing.

This program was written and narrated by G. Edward Griffin. It is based upon 
the book, The Ark of Noah, by David Fasold and includes testimony by Mr. 
Fasold, author Donald Patten, marine engineer Sam Windsor, and archaeologist 
Marvin Luckerman.
