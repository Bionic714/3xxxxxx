Guess I'll have to download just to know how big a boat that fits two of each species really is."
,oq242,2006-01-27T21:04Z,"matselm:  I'd suggest doing just that!  This movie is more of a scientific analysis that doesn't try to push any particular religion, it admits the theological impacts of such a finding but isn't driven by them.

,orgpunk,2006-01-31T20:10Z,"""This movie is more of a scientific analysis that doesn't try to push any particular religion"" Exept for dowsing, hohohoho... Dowsing is VERY ""scientific""! "
,oq242,2006-02-03T20:20Z,"actually orgpunk, the section where they use a MFGD (which is similar to dowsing) it is specifically commented on as being controversial.  Afterwards ground-penetrating radar is used for the same purpose ad the ""dowsing""."
,s2bdoo,2006-03-23T07:49Z,"haha ha yea right.poor deluded fools i parked the boat in  Hawaii like any good profit would, not on a nasty mountain in the middle of a desert,later dudes Noah."
,raine777,2007-12-01T09:31Z,"Why do so many people keep making idiotic statements like ""This is the real Noah's ark"".

GUYS, USE YOUR IMAGINATION:

NOAH'S ARK WAS MADE OF WOOD, I WONDER, COULD IT HAVE BROKEN UP INTO MORE THAN ONE PART? I WONDER!? NOT.

IT SAYS ""MOUNTAINS OF ARAT"" NOT ""MOUNTAIN"". THE BOAT BROKE UP INTO PIECES. THAT IS WHY IT IS IN TWO PLACES, DUH.

INSTEAD OF BASHING YOUR OPINIONS AND BEING CARELESS WITH THE TRUTH AND SLANDERING MANY VALID HISTORIANS FROM HUNDREDS OF YEARS AGO TO THE PRESENT, CARE ABOUT THE TRUTH AND BE PATIENT."
