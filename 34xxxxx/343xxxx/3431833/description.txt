Einherjer. The coolest Melodic Black Folk Metal band in existance, even though they come from a part of Norway where they talk like they have a squirrel shoved half-way down their throats. This is pretty much the first folk metal group I could stand because they make so kickass music, even if you are the kind to think lyrics about norse mythology are cheesy you will forgive them.

This is not something that deserves listening to, this is something you MUST listen to, on pain of fucking death. Do it now. FUCKING METAL
