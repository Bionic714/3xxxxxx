USER COMMENT: One-Half Good, 5 December 2005 (7/10)
Author: Douglas Beijer from Molokai, HI

D-Day: The Total Story is nicely covered on Disc 1. Disc 2 is something else.

Disc 1 of this two disc set is entertaining.

There are three 45 minute episodes spanning the preparation for the invasion through the eventual breakout from the beachheads. Good archival footage and appropriate narration.

Story of D-Day without the detail of "Battlefield" (1995) Series "Battle of Normandy" episode.

The bonus, again about 45 minutes, is an informative Eisenhower Biography.

Disc 2 is generally disappointing.

Episode 1 is a propaganda piece predominately on the 101st Airborne as Air Cav. Little on the jumping out of airplanes set, much on the helicopter folks. They can get there fast and kill anything that moves. OK, but what does Vietnam through George The First's Iraq have to do with D-Day?

Episode 2 is "Letters Home." I did not find this particularly interesting but opinions vary.

The bonus is on the Sherman tank. Good footage and information.

From all I've seen so far which is just Disk 1, this is great!  All the files included are linked to from the nfo webpage in the download to give you easy access to all the files. They all work, I checked.  The links change color (sometimes only after you refresh the page) after you click it.  That means you'll always know which you've watched and which you haven't.  Thanks to Warmonger for the DVD-5 source!

These are high quality so don't think you are going to waste your time with crappy rips.
