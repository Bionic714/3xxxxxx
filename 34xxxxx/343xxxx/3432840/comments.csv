,buba2523,2007-03-21T19:11Z,"Of course it is gonna run fast - the th efault game speed settings for this one are maxed out. All you need to do is once you have started playing a mission,  go to options and change the game speed settings - no cycle eaters or whatever  are necessary."

,dlachm1,2008-05-15T17:48Z,You have to run the game in windows 95 mode if it crashes.  You should be able to right click on the red alert icon and find some running options.
,LeDrewxcore,2008-07-26T13:42Z,This doesnt work well with the expansions.
,paper951,2008-08-01T05:24Z,"need help i run the game and it says

,PawnSacrifice,2008-08-10T06:00Z,"Do you have to burn this to a CD? I keep getting asked to insert the CD. Can't find any mountable image with A120%. 

I am simple...but thanks for the upload. Somone help us make this work? "
,PawnSacrifice,2008-08-10T06:20Z,"Tried burning it to CD. Still doesn't work. I give up with this. 

Unless you've VERY experienced I would try downloading a different version. "
,PawnSacrifice,2008-08-10T06:36Z,"Ok, I have it working without CD's. I think it might simply be one of those things where the game doesn't work if its being uploaded at the same time? 

Copy the folder to another part of your computer and run RA95 from the one NOT being uploaded. "
,Cyrose,2008-08-23T14:37Z,"It works great. 
You just have to lower the game speed. 
I'm having a problem with the scroling though. I put it to the lowest setting, but it's still way too fast. "
,argulle,2008-12-27T19:43Z,"Great torrent. Very easy to install

if you (as i had) game crashes, just run the ra95 in windows 95, lower the game speed is good to. The game also holds a trainer. 

Extremly good seed and easy to instal.´

Seed/quality of game 10/10

Game/quality 8/10"

,HandySolo,2011-09-05T02:33Z,67MiB most likely a rip which has no movies or music.
,christliche,2011-09-21T02:47Z,ONLY PROBLEM I AM HAVING: Some of the graphic colors are weird. And scrolling around the map is super fast and annoying...scrolling speed is all the way down. Help!
,Track706,2012-08-06T15:39Z,"Okay, for everyone who is stuck, here is what you do:

1.) Change the file name from ""Command & Conquer Red Alert.rar"" to ""Command & Conquer Red Alert.iso"".
2,) Download Daemon Tools from this site and mount the .iso file.
3.) Unrar the ISO file using WinRAR (also on this site) and go into the RA95 folder.
4.) Right-Click > Properties > Compatibility.
5.) Check ""Run this program in compatibility mode"" and select either ""Windows 95 or Windows XP. The other options will show fucked up colors.
6.) Check ""Run in 256 colors"", ""Disable visual themes"" and ""Disable desktop composition"".
7.) Run RA95.EXE

If you did it right, the game should:
A.) Have the least amount of fucked up colors/garbage (can't fully get rid of it, but this is the best possible).
B.) Run at normal speed (but this is something that you can change in the menus regardless).
C.) (and most importantly) Allow you to pan the screen smoothly.

Hope this helps!"
