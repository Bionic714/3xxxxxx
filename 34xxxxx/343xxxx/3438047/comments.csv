But the rip is good."
,minutten,2011-10-23T19:50Z,"harigata a lot of people would disagree with you. The series have received *excellent*. The series have received 9.1, which is extremely high - up there with Mad Men, Band of Brothers and Game of Thrones. Maybe your taste is not useful to the most of us? Either way, it doesn't really matter what you think. People are here to download the torrent."
