,Ebaill,2006-10-17T22:10Z,"Someone has to explain me the weird thing that happens to this piece:
It seems as if it just can be downloaded to 87,1 %.  When that mysterious point is reached, upload continues (from what I can see) but none seems to be getting past that figure.
I've tried to DL on another PC and when it got to 87,1 %, all files were complete........

Would be interesting if someone could comment or perhaps verify that it actually IS complete at 87,1 %.

I really don't understand what's happening, but I thought I'd check it out so that I can remove it of there is something wrong with the upload.
Wouldn't want to piss off the community........."
