Perhaps no other American band is so adept at the vintage British neo-prog formula as Iluvatar. On Children, this Baltimore-area group is equal parts Genesis and Fish-era Marillion, as singer Glenn McLaughlin once again leads the way in his best Phil Collins-meets-Fish vocal/lyrical synthesis... the compositions are so compelling, the melodies so engaging, and the performances so polished that it would be unfair to dismiss Children as another neo rip-off. These tracks flow incredibly well, thanks to the band members? selfless ensemble orientation. No pointless noodling here - any and all instrumental interludes complement the songs.
