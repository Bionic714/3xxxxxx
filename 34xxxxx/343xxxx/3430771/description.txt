Altern8 consisted of Mark Archer, a fan of House music and Chris Peat, a former music technology student. Legend has it they were former deck chair attendants (in Stafford?!), they went on to form Nexus 21, a purely techno band. They changed their name to Altern8 when they started producing Hardcore and Rave tracks. As Altern8 they played gigs in "chemical warfare suits" and "gas masks" filled with Vic's Vapo Rub.LOL
