,jake_75,2006-04-25T16:40Z,"It's not fake, works fine and as far as I can tell, it's jackie boy"
,ScottWolf,2006-05-04T17:38Z,"What do you mean not fake, Jake?  Have you listened to any of the tracks?  Clearly not.     For the rest of you - 
This is not the album you're looking for.  It's a decoy set up to deter you from downloading.
Again, don't bother wasting your time with this one."

,durruti,2006-11-04T20:54Z,"Not my taste in music, tbh, but I've just d/l'd it for my sister and I can confirm this is NOT fake.

Thanks for the up."
