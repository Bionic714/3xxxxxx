Ransom for a Dead Man (1971) 

Produced as a second pilot for the Columbo TV series, three years after Prescription: Murder (1968) (TV). Its success led to Columbo being made part of a rotating Mystery Movie wheel of programs for most of the 1970s.

Plot outline:
A lawyer comes up with a clever plan to murder her husband. After the deed is done, a seemingly slow-witted, slovenly homicide detective is assigned to the case--but he's not nearly as incompetent as he appears to be.
