,pparol,2006-01-30T09:28Z,"Thanks!
More details?"
[V],Krisiun,2006-01-30T18:06Z,"Thx!
This is the English version from SSG (Don't let the size fool you, it's heavily packed -> 450Mb). Works fine, just pay attention to the install notes."

,gullannagulleplutt,2006-01-31T10:29Z,"A nice help to install, worked perfect!
 Unzip, unrar. Disable the network before installation
and don't enable it back before you'll activate the
program. Run our keygen and install using the serial
number from keygen. Don't close keygen. On the first
run you'll be prompted to activate software or start
with trial. Press ""Aready purchased"". Type (since Corel
guys forgot to use paste handler, you have to type it
by hands) serial once more, press ""Phone"", copy
installation ID (w/o dashes!) to the keygen and
generate activation code. Type (again, by hands!)
activation code into activation dialog, and activate
the program. Voila![/center]"

something is wrong with torrent. "
,sandertjeb,2006-01-31T23:20Z,"Help!! It keeps saying the activation code isn't right. Now please tell me what do I need to copy into the instalation code?
I tried to copy the long code without the - between it. I tried to copy the id numbers. And I tried to copy both of them together. But nothing seems to work :("
,Vitrivius,2006-02-08T08:59Z,Invalid activation code
,Vitrivius,2006-02-08T09:51Z,The keygen only produces invalid activation codes. Does anyone know where I can find a working keygen?
,sandertjeb,2006-02-13T17:45Z,Invalid activation keys :(
,NeuromystiX,2006-02-14T22:42Z,Use instalation code and id number in keygen without spaces and it should work.
,xr546,2006-02-16T22:42Z,English? I happened to get it in German ...
,byggfabt,2006-02-17T09:04Z,ID-Code ?????
,JeanHup,2006-02-17T10:39Z,"After following gullannagulleplutt's guidelines to installing it everything went fine.... untill the second time I launched the program: it asked for activation again.
Anyone any clue?"
,ROCKSCORP,2006-02-21T13:39Z,"does it have working cracks?

pls upload only crack if it works ty"
,andy_sim,2006-02-23T01:37Z,"This works perfectly if you follow the instructions, no need for any cracks other than the keygen provided"
,gflare,2006-03-06T15:41Z,"Sadly... This is not the complete Corel Graphics Suite X3...  It lacks PowerTRACE.

Can someone upload PowerTRACE? or at least a real Corel Graphics Suite?"
,equazcion,2006-03-14T16:56Z,Testing
,equazcion,2006-03-14T17:01Z,"If you're having trouble activating this, try entering codes into the keygen with all the letters capitalized; it is case-sensitive. Also, if you're entering codes into Corel by pasting, you need to type in the line by hand also in order to be able to continue. Try backspacing the last character in the line and re-typing it by hand. Then you'll be able to continue."
,equazcion,2006-03-14T23:24Z,"To the guy from SSG, you should look into changing the keygen so that it automatically converts all the user input to capitals. All the codes from Corel appear to only contain uppercase characters, and your keygen produces the wrong codes when people manually enter lowercase ones. And you CAN paste codes into Corel's activation screens, you just need to type at least one character by hand before the ""continue"" buttons are enabled."
,equazcion,2006-03-14T23:26Z,"Thanks for releasing this, by the way. Works great."
,Shamelessrock,2006-03-15T17:22Z,thnx just need this

,alexandr_,2006-04-19T02:42Z,"About PowerTRACE: this is no longer a standalone program - and yes, it IS included.
Just right-click a bitmap in CorelDRAW, and select 'Trace bitmap' - the PowerTRACE window shows up..."
,alexandr_,2006-04-19T02:45Z,"@Freakazoidski:
Yes, the tracker is not cooperative at all. However, if you torrent program knows about DHT, there should be no problem - you get the 'This user no longer exists' error, but the file downloads fine.
My choice of a DHT-enabled torrent client is uTorrent - but I bet other clients also implement DHT."
,x-citodonia,2006-04-21T18:27Z,"Thanks Vovik för denna fina torrenten!! Fungerar alldeles ypperligt om man läser nfo filen.. Kan ni inte hantera en keygenerator äns, så föreslår jag att ni köper programvaran.. Tack!"
,leady4,2006-04-29T22:33Z,"Does nobody read the .nfo's any more??
If you follow the instructions word for word it installs fine.  Open it with word/notepad BTW.
And yes I agree the copy and paste options do work.  I just used the keyboard shortcut's (ctrl C (copy) and ctrl V (paste)) and it worked sweet as a nut.
Excellent upload guys.
and BTW you do have to have a DHT enabled torrent client for it to d/l.
