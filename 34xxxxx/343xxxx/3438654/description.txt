Reviews:
---------------

"Minor Majority only gets better and better. Their fourth album is a triumph and a display of exquisite melancholick pop/rock."

"Good melodies, clever arrangements, competent musicians and a characteristically soothing voice make "Reasons to hang around" one of the Norwegian albums you have to buy this year". 

"will wager a glass of red wine and a couple of lit candles that the record will be played a lot, by many, this year - all year".

Most of the remaining heavy weight reviews are in today, and we are delighted to observe that the band's new record has rolled a full yatzy, with 5 out of 6'es "everywhere". 
TV2 Nettavisen thinks that "PÕl AngelskÕr's stable, but sensitive folkpop,stands steady as a rock on it's crystal clear sound and secure melody lines. 
And yet, there's usually a small twist that gives the songs the little extra which makes them land safely in the consciousness of the listener"  
Dagbladet speaks of a "band has been labelled melancholic, but is that really the best description? 
This is sooner experienced as an album that carries you away on light wings through a candlelit winter."
