,bruno_83,2007-03-14T02:38Z,"..Even though this isn't my torrent at all, I've been re-filling and re-seeding this shit for times and ages; -it's just you suckers who hit and run who make your own sorrow by not sharing once getting served.

-It's clear Mr. Czacha_47 did what he could, now you people should continue checking back from time to time to see if anyone needs a re-fix, too..

-I'm sick of this leecher shit."

Okay, I wrote this review just for notice how cool this game is.

The bad: 
The game was released in January 2006. How come that in the cutscenes, the characters mouths isn't moving when they talk? 
The sound quality isn't that good either, it's kind of scratchy when they talk and when the music is playing.
There's also several annoying things which can piss me off, an example could be in the multiplayer mode, a huge black box is popping up with a message while I'm running and shooting, and I can't see nothing (it's a bug!). And by the way, I don't think that the game is supporting my soundcard. It's a Creative Audigy4 24-bit, and the music is lagging, WTF!? I have only standard Windows startup applications running in the background, but it's still lagging = doesn't support newer soundcards. I've tried the game on a friends PC with an AC97 onboard soundcard: No problems at all. And there isn't any patch avaliable for this game, only for PS2. That means, people cheats as hell in multiplayer. I played with a guy today, who wallhacked and speedhacked. He stood in the wall with a Desert Eagle with scope, and headshotted me all the time. Guess who was pissed?

The good: The multiplayer mode is awesome. Forget about Counter-Strike, this is the real deal. Imagine Hitman/Max Payne in multiplayer, well this is it! You can lean around corners and pwn your friends or foes, it's just creating and account, and in under 2 minutes you're playing. There's a lot of maps, all of 'em are cool (my favorite is the Mall). You can design your own character, a cop or a gangster, to the very smallest detail. Also, you can choose any weapon for your character, without buying it like in CS. LAN gaming is also supported (I can recommend downloading Hamachi if you want to play LAN over the net, example: You and your friend(s) want to play private with no others from around the world. You install Hamachi, creating a network by entering the network name and password, and let your friends join your Hamachi workgroup. Now no strangers can join, and you don't even have to create an online account. BTW, seek in the Hamachi forum if you experience problems with connecting to a game. It helped me out). The graphics is also nice, try setting your resolution to min. 1024x768, and set antialiasing to min. 4x, and anisotropic filtering to min. 1x, then it all will look very realistic. A good effect that I like in the game, is the Matrix-bullet-effect. When someones shoots at you, you'll see the waves behind the bullet, and I love it.

But after all, the developers should have put some more time in it. Sometimes it seems like it was all about getting the game released as fast as possible, which is kind of sad because it's a great game.

I'll give 6 out of 10. The multiplayer mode, and the create-a-character mode, is genius and rising it up. So please download, we need more players for playing online!
BTW, my online name is DK.ande2977, so if you see this name, then it's me.

(If you found some grammatic errors in my review, then all I can say is: I'm not english/american, so screw you)."

,Bender187,2007-11-22T16:16Z,"Sorry if you couldnt understand that what i mean is:
