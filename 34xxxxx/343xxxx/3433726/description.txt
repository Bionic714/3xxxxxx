4 Examples starting off with Hello World ending with a Video Game..

Source Code contains the majority of the algorithms you need to get a basic
game up and running easily.. Simply start off by reading Hello World, Than Random Pixels, then Knights Tour, than you can finish it off by MPGTA..

Also contains source code for a few tools I wrote to use with this Pack..

mxf2c - Translates MasterX Fonts (which really just translate truetype fonts to mxf) to C array
bmp2c - Translates a 24bit Bitmap to a C data structure array
mxFont2 - MasterX Font Editor.. With the ability to translate a windows truetype font to MXF to use in your PSP game..

Full Source Code for everything is included and your free to use it change it destroy it do whatever you so please with it... Its all Free..
