Do we really need a punk/hardcore/rockabilly/alternative music tribute to Johnny Cash? Having heard this album, Im positive we do. 

Wolverine records released this album.  As you may or may not know, Wolverine is a small german label for punk, hardcore, garage, ska etc. No surprise this album kinda flew under the radar I suppose. If you like your country industrial with a twist of punk and harcore rockabilly this is the album for you. 
If you reckognice any of the bands involved with this you know you are in for a treat. Musically the contributions here range from folk to country to rockabilly, punk to psychobilly, and industrial to americana.
