,adamlee69,2006-04-05T09:03Z,"I've downloaded this torrent and have used winrar to open the files.  This puts the files together into one rar file but for some reason, why I go to open this single rar file, it doesn't work.  Instead, the following message appears ""the archive is either in unknown format or is damaged"".

Have I wasted my time downloading this file?  Does it work?  Am I doing something wrong?

Can anyone help?"

,POBSTAR,2006-05-03T22:44Z,"Hi Peenag and others that might need this.

For your knowlage keep in mind that you never register a software using your phone.

you use the phone activation when reguested by the software installation or first use to enter the serial number provide by the crack or the Keygen Generator that is located somewere in the download. 

You will need also this free software to read the nfo files that come with the torrent. NFO Viewer that you can get for free at: http://www.softpedia.com/progDownload/DAMN-NFO-Viewer-RC-Download-2132.html#"
,POBSTAR,2006-05-03T22:48Z,PS: keep the link of softpedia.com cus for the present time it is the best clean download Windows software Website. ( You can get there all the Windows application that you can't get if you are bust by Windows Update or Microsoft Update.)
,POBSTAR,2006-05-03T22:49Z,"Also remember that in some case on 

Adobe program you will have to 

proceded like this.

First generate the initial serial key 

when it is need by the program when it 

is installing at first. So you should 

have on fonction The Keygen Generator 

active. You past the serial in the 

blank field of the installation.

Secondley when you activate the 

program for use for the first time a 

screen will ask you to register the 

software. In this screen you will see 

a second row of serial digits. Copy 

those in the second blank space of the 

Keygen Generator an activate it. Il 

will give you a third serial key set 

that you enter in the blank space of 

the screen. 

Be sure to enter it manualy this time.
After your done."

No need to be so cryptic.  The keygen works the response code the keygen is looking for is the number which the installer calls the activation code.  Copy and paste this number into the response code box and bob's your uncle.  Now when it opens it just hangs.  Will reinstall in case that is the problem otherwise I think it might be a Vista issue.
