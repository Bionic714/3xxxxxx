,orgpunk,2006-01-14T21:28Z,Duration........01:27:10? On IMDB it says 1:33.
,Bongofloot,2006-01-15T10:57Z,"Well it's the real deal, OK
Looks to be a TV-Rip, probably cropped to remove subtitles or something... Most of the end credits are missing, so that explains the wrong duration. Man I love this movie, been looking for it for ages... This is actually the only release of it on the net... Watchable but would prefer a dvd-rip...Anyways gave it 5/5 stars for actulally finding it, and being a good TV-rip...

Bongo "

It's pal source, running 25fps. that's why it's shorter, one more frame per second."
,jallupallu,2009-05-11T17:55Z,"Damn, I haven't seen this epic movie in almost 20years. So tempted for downloading this but I think I'll wait a month because it's going to be released in BLURAY!
