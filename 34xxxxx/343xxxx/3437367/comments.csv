Tänk vad smidigt det skulle funka här då "

,Moondrinker,2006-11-21T16:27Z,"This is a very good torrent, im downloading at 156 k/s and still climbing!
I'm only concerned that there might be a trojan in one of the files, many people claimed that there was a trojan in the keygen though many anti virus programs often trigger a trojan alarm at keygen programs so there shouldn't be a problem.

Please keep seeding!
