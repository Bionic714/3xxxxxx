,gertfj채rt,2006-01-23T20:58Z,And I thought it was greed...
,Hampaman70,2006-02-03T14:26Z,I thought it was man who was the most evil of all characters. Nice to throw the blame on somebody else (i.e. GOD )! Is it not man that is responsible of all the atrocities (even if they chose to exonarate themselves by saying it was in the name of God)?
,Hampaman70,2006-02-03T14:28Z,"Continued: I'm a mathematician and cosmologist and I cannot, and will not, believe that creation is a ""by chance"" event. Evolution: Yes, to some extent!"
,bigmickey,2006-02-04T11:01Z,Hampaman70 - you'd be a better mathematician and cosmologist if you questioned your beliefs a bit more.
,bigmickey,2006-02-04T11:03Z,"Thanks lordairivis, I had been oping someone would put this out."
,Hampaman70,2006-02-06T10:06Z,"What do you know about my mathematics?! Or my cosmology?! You haven't read any of my articles! Belief in God doesn't make you incapable to do science. I might even say that it's the other way around. Look at all the great advances made in maths, physics,.... All done by Christians."
,Rillion12,2006-02-13T21:55Z,What an odd place for a theological discussion.
,Rillion12,2006-02-13T23:10Z,Please come back and seed!  I just heard Dawkins talking about this series on a podcast and would REALLY like to be able to see this.  Thanks!
,DanLoader,2006-02-24T04:03Z,"But everything Religion is based upon contradicts everything scientific!

Science does not help the ""God created the universe"" theory. Actually science proclaims the world is millions of years older than religion is to have us beleive. Religion wants us to think that heaven is right above us - the men who built the tower of babel almost touched it. But science proves that heaven isn't there, just the atmosphere and then space. Religious people said the sun revolved around the earth, science proved otherwise.

Granted science has never given a difinitive answer of where we came from, but this journey of discovery is only just beginning. Religious people are still stuck in the times of the Bible, refusing only to beleive what those ancient humans thought."
,Raverbasher,2006-02-26T13:54Z,"Sorry guys, think this is gonna take serveral posts, got a lot to get off my chest.  Here we go:

Religion =/= just Judaism, Christianity or Islam.  There are other faiths in the world, such as 

Buddhism, Confuciaism and Indigenous religions.  How can 'religion' and God be the root of all 

evil, when a belief structure such as Buddhism does not actually believe in God?

Secondly,  how can God (not even acknowleged by some communities around the world) be said to be 

the root of all evil, when he is a fictitious character?  Surely if he is fictious, then it is 

the 'stroy teller', the inventer of the character, that is ""the root of all evil"".  If God is 

actually the root of all evil, then Dawkins is actually arguing that God exists outside of 

humanity as an individual entity, not created by us.  Either that, or it is humanity that is 

culpable for all the evil in the world, not God and therefore, not religion.  BY HIS ARGUMENT!"
,Raverbasher,2006-02-26T14:04Z,"Hmm, not sure what happened there, anyway, ""thanks to Christianity we lost 1000 years of scientific evolution"".  No, thanks to human political and cultural power games we lost 1000yers of of scientific evolution.  A Christian, living his religion, ""treat other as you would like to be treated, and love God with all your heart, all your soul, and all your mind"" is not going to stand in the way of scientific progress.  A politician who has a lot to lose, will.

""Science does not help God created the Universe theory"".  When Einstein was uncovering the fundamentla principles of the unviverse in Physics, he called them ""God's handwritting"".  For a religious scientist, science proves (italics) the existence of the divine or scared in whawatever form they happen to percieve it to be for them.  Also, the bilief in an ultimate truth that science will uncover, is the same as the belief in some for of absolute, such as God."

,sultanselim,2006-05-19T17:13Z,"What's up with you christians refusing to realize your God is a joke? 

I really believe you when saying your a cosmologist... especially as cosmology does NOT fit with christianity at all. Big Bang theory does not fit with the description in the Bible, and christians can't call some of the Bible false, or wrong, and still claiming the rest of the nonsense is true."
,Benzo1972,2006-10-20T11:51Z,"I just found out about this Dawkins character, lol.  I can't believe he has the balls to say these things.  He sure found a way to sell a shitload of books though!  I was raised Christian, but have always been skeptical (because most biblical stories are either meant to be taken metaphorically or they're just straight bogus.  Anywho, he makes some great arguments - very thought provoking stuff.  Theres only one seeder now so anyone who can, please, please, please help me out.  Thanks!!"
,paraglider,2007-01-06T21:18Z,How come we laugh at some myths and light  candles in praise of others? A fair question? I belive it is.
,spiracle,2007-06-17T21:32Z,"Thanks for the upload.  Just a small suggestion - 350 mb per episode is a good size for a 45minute standard-def tv show.  

Then poor people like me who haven't yet upgraded to a dvd burner can fit two episodes onto one cd-rom."
,tjoball,2007-09-02T17:48Z,"I just saw this conference, will be interesting for those who ejoyed dawkins.

,Karwani,2007-12-05T00:43Z,plz seed
,amberfail,2008-06-19T13:41Z,"Can't wait to watch this. The Growing Up In The Universe series was brilliant, and if this is anything like it, I'll be hooked all over again."
,_slash,2008-09-01T19:47Z,"thank you... btw, great seeding"
,kr0niXzX,2008-09-30T05:19Z,"Dawkins is an excellent scientist, the world needs to wake up..."
,awdeetdeet,2008-10-23T00:05Z,If you like this make sure to pick up his book The God Delusion...extremely insightful!
,Infernalis,2008-12-05T09:16Z,"@Raverbasher

""In January 2006 I presented a two-part television documentary on 
British television (Channel Four) called Root of All Evil? From the 
start, I didn't like the title. Religion is not the root of all evil, for 
no one thing is the root of all anything.""

Do your homework!

,drjayden,2009-01-24T16:21Z,"The God Delusion is one helluva book.

After reading it, I really felt like watching this docu. Thanks for uploading it, Lordairivis."
,blackjesus69,2009-03-08T14:08Z,"Oklahoma is trying to have Dawkins banned from the state...

,obsidianstray,2009-06-03T09:16Z,"Thanks for putting this up. I'm reading the God Delusion now, so when I read this existed, I had to get it.

It's a bit late to respond to Yosanis, but if anyone else is looking for other reason-based videos, there is a wealth of them on YouTube, some of them VERY good. http://www.youtube.com/profile?user=ObsidianStray&view=subscriptions Not all of those users are relevant, but most are. I think QualiaSoup is probably my favorite."
,balanced,2010-05-10T02:45Z,"Look you fuckers; if this documentary has any truth to its' title then it is all about me.  So piss off now with your money, your drugs, and your women.  I am the root of all evil and shall remain so until you are all finished needing me.  Thank you."
