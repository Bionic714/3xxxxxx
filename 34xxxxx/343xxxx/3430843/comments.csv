,Elazul,2006-01-12T19:39Z,Why upload torrents that already exists? http://thepiratebay.org/details.php?id=3430828
,Cpt_Spanky,2006-01-12T19:48Z,"That's because a majority of us can't get on the Strike tracker due to ""Access denied: peers limit reached"". So I'm very thankful changoboy."
,Cpt_Spanky,2006-01-12T19:50Z,"Let me clearify, can't get on the tracker that was posted in mininova, didn't notice you're using a different one. My mistake."
,IceWarm,2006-01-13T02:30Z,Thanks for this one.

,Skaramuche,2007-09-15T05:09Z,"Forgive me for this, What exactly is meant by PS2DVD?  Surely there aren't any PS2 emulators out there, so do you burn it to a DVDROM and put in your PS2?  And if so do you need a modchip for it to work?"
,True_astoroth,2008-06-08T14:54Z,"Well Skaramuche, seeing as most PS2 games are above 700 megs, they usually won't fit on a cd-r any way, so yes they have to go to a DVD.   You don't need a mod chip to play burned games either, either look up Swap Magic, or use Cogswap which is free, unlike swap magic.  Just do a Youtube search on cogswap you can find all the tutorials and such there.   Also look up the video for a Slide Tool."
,True_astoroth,2008-06-08T14:57Z,"Oh, and don't bother downloading Swap Magic from a torrent, because that will eliminate the purpose of it.  You need a mod-chip, swap magic or cog swap to play burned ps2 dvd's in the first place. :)
If you don't wanna pay for a mod chip or swap magic discs, stick with cogswap that's your best bet.  Oh and do the ""Independence Exploit"" version of cogswap, all others have completely failed for me."
