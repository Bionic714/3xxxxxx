Hi there all you PDA fanatics.
Here are the maps all we Eastern Europeans wanted.
Enjoy it.
Just copy the hole folder (after unpacking) with all the files to the PDA┬┤s storage card where you have all the other maps.
Working just fine for me, I use a Yakumo Delta 300 same as a Mitac Mio 168 RS.
No crack or key needed for this install.
