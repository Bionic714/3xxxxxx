   SKINS INCLUDED:

   Original Project Mayhem III Skin from CVS only.
   It guarantees everything works perfectly and keeps Releases Small & Clean.
   This skin is constantly changed and updated. I you want to use other skins,
   make sure they are suitable for this particular CVS Version of XBMC.
   Don┬┤t ask me about problems with 3rd Party Skins - You┬┤re on your own here !

   The only thing that┬┤s changed is the look of the Webserver Interface.
   I replaced the Original with the Project Mayhem III Style Webserver Interface
   from KanadaKid (Scott). Looks very nice ┬┤coz it perfectly fits the PM3 style.
   This also adds some small, but cool Functions to the Webserver Interface.

   SCRIPTS INCLUDED:

   FlexiBrowser / GameSaves / GameSpotPlus / GameTrailers
   QuickTimeBrowser [fixed] (Movie Trailers) / WebRadio (simpleKML V2)
   XBMCLyrics / XBMCScripts

   All Scripts suit the Project Mayhem III style.

   I modified the /Skin/Project Mayhem III/PAL/DialogSubMenu.xml so that all
   of the Scripts appear in the Scripts Submenu. If you don┬┤t like this, or
   some of the Scripts, you should edit this file to your personal preferences.
   The original file from CVS has been renamed to DialogSubMenu.xml.CVS

   Get more Scripts @ http://www.xbmcscripts.com or via the XBMCScripts menu.

   VISUALISATION ADDONS INCLUDED (All Zipped):

   G-Force:  1507 total (including the CVS supplied ones)
   MilkDrop: 7977 total (including the CVS supplied ones)
              
   I slightly modified some settings in /visualisations/milkdrop.xml
   The Milkdrop Addon Pack with 7977 Presets is the default setting.
   The original file from CVS has been renamed to milkdrop.xml.CVS

   RELEASE NOTES:

   Exchanged "my own" MilkDrop Preset Pack with the
   "MilkDrop for XBMC Preset MegaPack 2006-01-11 (7977 Presets!)"
   Kevin Sartori mailed these to me and as always he did a wonderful job!
   Now there are no duplicates anymore and this also adds a bunch of new Presets.
   You can find his .nfo for the Pack in the Milkdrop Folder.
   If you┬┤re a MilkDrop fan, be sure to drop him a line to say Thanks ;-)

   CHANGELOG:

   To keep this .nfo shorter, I only list the topmost 3 lines here, so you can
   see what┬┤s included here. Always read the official XBMC Changelog at  
   http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/xbmc/XBMC/Changelog.txt?view=markup
   You can also find it in /docs/Changelog.txt

   18-01-2006 changed: Music files with embedded images but no album tag are now
                       cached only for the file.
   18-01-2006 fixed: [ 1405320 ] Stacked files could be "cleaned" of their stack
                     criteria twice.
   18-01-2006 fixed: Buttonscroller initial visibility conditions on home.

   TROUBLESHOOTING TIPS:

   If you are experiencing all kinda weird problems using an updated version
   of XBMC it is always a good idea to delete the XBMC┬┤s "SaveGame"
   using the Micro$oft Dashboard.
   Alternatively, just delete the E:/TDATA/0face008 and E:/UDATA/0face008 dirs.
   This is especially important if you are updating from quite an old version.

   To avoid problems you should also check - with every new release - 
   if the included XboxMediaCenter.xml has been changed significantly.
   You should then update your own customized XboxMediaCenter.xml accordingly.

   If using XBMC as Dashboard, don┬┤t forget to update the files on DRIVE ┬┤C┬┤.
