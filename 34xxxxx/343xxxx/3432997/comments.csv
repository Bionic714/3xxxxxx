japan also uses PAL as well, infact, most releases in japan are PAL, i presume that this one is NTSC cause at one point there were plans to release this in NA as well."

,deeznutz420,2006-05-16T20:20Z,"Hey Shady 78, I had the same problem with mine but it's so simple it hurts. When you choose the file to copy over to the xbox from the memory card move the cursor to the right once more, and you will get the option to copy and delete instead of just delete. Hope I helped."

""NTSC is the analog television system in use in Canada, Japan, South Korea, the Philippines, the United States, Mexico, and some other countries, mostly in the Americas (see map). It is named for the National Television Standards Committee, the U.S. standardization body that adopted it.""

Japan is NTSC you tard. NO games released in Japan are PAL."
