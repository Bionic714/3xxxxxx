,markoramius,2006-02-12T18:39Z,Crap! This is apparently only for Mac computers...
,TreyFlip,2006-02-13T21:48Z,"I got the cracks to work, both of them let me into the game. You need to replace the Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2005 icon in game folder with the same icon in the crack. Even though I did get the game to work, when I try to tee off from anythign but practice, the game ""closes unexpectedly""... any ideas? any fixes for this???"

,Kimmel,2008-01-24T16:32Z,"I do not know, how you can NOT get this this to work..?! It's simple as fuck, mates.. =) 

Download

Double click the original game

After unpacking, place the folder in Applications

Double click the crack

After unpacking, place the icon in the Tiger Woods Folder

And click replace

Click the icon to launch the game.. 

It even works on my standard MacBook, so why shouldn't it do on yours as well..?!"
