Do not d/l as he intention is to mislead"
,carv,2006-01-13T18:24Z,"This is an ultima online client (I am not sure which one). Obsidian is a free shard[server] where one can play online for free.  It is kinda misleading the way this is worded here. I think with the latest UO client - Mondain's Legacy - one can download it for free from the official site.  There are also very many free shards one can check out... some more into role playing, some more into pvp...   Do a scroogle search and will find lots of info on UO free shards... or grab a client and get UOGateway and/or Razor and start checking them out.  UO while not having the latest in graphics is still the best mmorpg game there is imho... "
,Broadband,2006-01-14T01:33Z,No it doesn't require Ultima Online as this is the entire game.  It's mentioned that you *should* have a copy as otherwise you would be pirating.  Then again why are you at PirateBay eh? :P
