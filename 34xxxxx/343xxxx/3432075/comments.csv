,Reaper82,2006-01-16T04:08Z,You know that torrent that is unbearably slow?  Its because asses like you are cheating the system.
,IvanOverkill,2006-01-16T12:11Z,Fuck you in the ass without any grease! People like you screw things up for everybody!

,bugmeless,2006-01-21T18:52Z,Hmm... might grab it if it means I can use my upstream bandwidth on torrents where it's needed most instead of where some lame-ass ratio tracker insists on taxing it ...

You dont need to change the 1:6 Ratio
(for 100% download) - NOOBS???

You need the right torrent engine then, just run it in I.P. shells

,LuluShoutX,2008-11-08T07:00Z,"LOL. It's a trash. It will not increase your ratio,
To keep ratio and download speed high I'm using Torrent Ratio Keeper. It's a plugin for BitTorrent/BitComet/uTorrent. It increases upload speed and gets more seeders."
