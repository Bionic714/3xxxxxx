,Sterkenburg,2006-08-08T23:06Z,"Damn, shady, you really do ignore your own torrents.  At least go through the really popular ones and make sure they're alive!  Halo, for example, is stuck at 92.5 (somehow i got to 92.6).

I wuz gunna unrar/uniso it an' add the filez it was missin', but ya can't cuz the stuff that's missin is part of the rar/iso files an' it's non-unrar/iso-able."
