THE EU HAS BEEN SOLD TO BRITAIN AS OUR BEST HOPE FOR THE FUTURE?. But behind the scenes, has another, more unsettling agenda been unfolding? The European Economic Community (EEC) began for Britain as a free-trade agreement in 1972. Today?s European Union is well on its way to becoming a federal superstate, complete with one currency, one legal system, one military, one police force ? even its own national anthem. In this shocking new documentary featuring EU insiders and commentators, independent author Phillip Day covers the history and goals of the European Union, as well as the disturbing, irrevocable implications this new government has for every British citizen. Whether the viewer is for or against Britain?s participation, this film asks the troubling questions the mainstream media has refused to confront.
