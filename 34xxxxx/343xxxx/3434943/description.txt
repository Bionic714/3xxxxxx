Release Notes: 
  
  Seems we overlooked a few hidden checks while testing, currency got changed
  and some other minor errors. This crackfix should take care of all the 
  problems. 

1. Unrar.
2. Apply the PPF to patch your image, or copy over the fixed executable to 
     your installation directory. 
3. Play the game.
