The Monks -- Black Monk Time <P>
1966 US Psychedelic
<P>
The Monks were US Army soldiers stationed in West Germany at the time. They were allegedly drunk & on speed, but this music is way ahead of its time. Sounds like the product derived by taking lots of acid, sort of like Blue Cheer.
<P>
Anyway, the band was forgotten but saw a resurrection in 1999 at WFMU's infamous "Cavestomp" retro concerts. For more info see www.the-monks.com . Might have trouble getting this torrent going, probably glitch with my provider, please be patient.
