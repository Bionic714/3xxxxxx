,GasGiver4711,2006-01-13T12:27Z,"@All: The Trackers are down, maybe due to TPBs movment. Try using a DHT compatible client. That should help"
,GasGiver4711,2006-01-13T15:11Z,"@All: Trackers seem to be back online, but a DHT compatible BT Client is still nice ;-)"

,KevinSartori,2006-01-17T17:42Z,"Thanks for taking the time to do these builds, GasGiver!"
,KevinSartori,2006-01-17T17:43Z,"For those who don't know, it's GasGiver who got me started on weeding duplicates out my Packs to begin with, so I'll always be grateful to him.  Thanks again, dude!"
,KevinSartori,2006-01-17T17:43Z,The pack of 10810 presets contains many duplicates.  You should use the MilkDrop for XBMC Preset MegaPack (see above link) in your next build.
,KevinSartori,2006-01-17T17:45Z,"There were 4138 same-name duplicates and 3137 content duplicate files.  Once I deleted those, there were no extra presets left!  3535+4138+3137=10810!"
,KevinSartori,2006-01-17T17:45Z,"I ran NoClone on this directory.  NoClone found 3535 content duplicate files (different files names, exact same content).  I deleted those.  Next I extracted the MegaPack into a temp folder.  Again using NoClone, I compared those two folders."
,KevinSartori,2006-01-17T17:46Z,"I extracted the Milkdrop.zip archive included in this build into a temp directory.  There were actually 10809 presets, with one .jpg file."
,KevinSartori,2006-01-17T17:47Z,"Thanks for taking the time to do these builds, GasGiver!  I just noticed that this build of XBMC contains 10810 MilkDrop presets.  I'm the maintainer of the MilkDrop for XBMC Preset MegaPack ."
,GasGiver4711,2006-01-17T19:41Z,"KevinSartori: I know ;-)  -  U sent me the Pack via email  -  and i replied to this mail, maybe u didnÂ´t get this mail. The next build will include your megapack ofcoz.
THX again for collecting these"
,EnergizerRabbit,2006-01-19T03:37Z,"Now that there are so many GasGiver releases, the piratebay search page is next to useless :(  I had to *google* to find this release.  Thanks for your hard work GasGiver!"
,GasGiver4711,2006-01-19T16:20Z,"EnergizerRabbit: LOL, the releases can be found via Google ...
HereÂ´s the new one  -  http://thepiratebay.org/details.php?id=3433249"
