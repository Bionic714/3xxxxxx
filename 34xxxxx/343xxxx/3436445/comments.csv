,gergith,2006-10-19T06:58Z,"you ignorant ignorant ignorant people... do you know what the crusades were? TERRORISM... the christian religion is as popular as it is, because of many many many waves of slaughter to spread the word of there god, including one which involved children.......


now... we need to be able to seperate THOSE terrorists, and muslium extismst terrorists from there religion, we both know neither christ nor mohamid really wants death to the other, they just want to be heard.. to actually believe the ENTIRE religion is about something is isnt, is PURE ignorance...


i mean honestly... to believe that people acting in there religion actualy are the ENTIRE religion is just retarded... bush pretends to be christian, and yet he is VERY far from friendly to his neighbors...  *sigh* just because someone says there acting in the name of someone doesnt mean it unless that someone agrees.. 99% of muslums dont agree with terrorism anymore then you do.. and yet there people are being brutilized because of how very few people have acted....


take your head out of your ass you arrogant ass.

you need to realize that the media is giving you 1% of the story on EVERYTHING....

the people who responsible for terrorism.... were funded and trained by cia......
