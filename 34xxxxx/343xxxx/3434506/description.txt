Strife is the rule of all existence --
to upgrade the physical and mental is, as so,
a war of my willpower -- arduous but sensible in its evils.
Hedonism break with "happiness,"
[thus] a Time when life must be taken.
Suffer raises the might to endure.
?My Enemies can only give me a moment of cold loneliness
until they seek to once again...stand aghast...of my...hate.?
Their Time is running out: see their foolish consistency.
Sadomasochists, draining each other of all their essence.
Little by little, if the weight of [?subjective?] reality
does not crush me, sorrow and the fountain weep are evaded.
For, I am able to heed
how bearable [objective] suffering truly is.
I know?
