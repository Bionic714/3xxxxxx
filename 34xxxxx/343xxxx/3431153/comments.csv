,benheadp22,2006-01-22T09:22Z,"Most likely have to use the Kiosk disk that was leaked previously, burn it to a DVD, boot to it, play something for a minute then using the guide, stop the game, eject the disk and pop in this disk... i've never tried it myself, but heard that the boot-then-swap method works for ANY burned game because the kiosk disk will boot when burned to a regular DVD5.  Good luck :)"
