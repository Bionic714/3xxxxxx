,nimbus123,2006-01-23T11:10Z,This is a really fun game. Especially with those ninjas on the first level. Listen to their conversations =P
,Rufstroll,2006-02-03T18:08Z,Works great. Thank you so much! Does anyone have the first game? It would be great! I've tried to download it from isohunt but the torrent is lacking seeds. Thanks again for the upload!
,TreyFlip,2006-02-14T07:31Z,"I cant get the game to open. I followed the instructions exactly, and the game goes to start for half a second, and closes... any suggestions?"
,crafterr,2006-02-18T05:48Z,"Mike whats the game about
i  havent dowloaded it yet but i was just wondering

THANX"
,mik6969,2006-03-01T13:13Z,"Treyflip - have you got toast? It works if you mount the discimage with toast first. I did´nt really like the first level with the ninjas, actually I thougth that NOLF1 was a lot better, but now Im in the middle of the game and enjoying it better.."
,blahblahtown,2006-03-04T18:22Z,"you said in your readme ""first, mount the cd images using toast, then run the installer on disk 1"" do you have to mount both images at the same time? or one after the other when the installer asks for them? "
,mikethejones,2006-03-08T22:26Z,  It does work better sometimes if you mount both before installing.
,TheGoodDoctorFunk,2006-03-12T00:29Z,"I can't get CD 1 to mount at all, but CD 2 will mount just fine. I have toast 7.01, anybody have the same issue?"
,TheGoodDoctorFunk,2006-03-14T21:28Z,"Also tried burning CD1 to a CD with toast, put it in the dirve, and it said that ""my machine could not recognize the data"".

..balls.."
,mik6969,2006-04-02T13:01Z,"Thanks a lot mikethejones for putting out great stuff here!!! This game works very nicely. If you got problems read what I wrote in Alien VS P2, the same goes for this game. Everybody who likes the sities kind of humoristic agent - games should enjoy this. I just don´t like the parts where you´ll have to sneek around. Then it´s nice to use the ""maphole""-cheat and go on to the next mission..."
,mik6969,2006-04-02T13:03Z,It should be the sixties of course... Sorry
,wahuracha,2006-04-19T16:47Z,DAMN!!!! you should write it in the info also that it's for Mac. I downloaded it and saw the Mac up there later.
,Deterrent,2006-05-16T15:28Z,"It says Mac, right at the ""Type"" :P

Too bad there isn't anymore seeders :("
,Henrik00,2006-10-29T20:59Z,"You should mark that its for mac better.
It was a very slow download and took over a day, and now I\ve just figured out it`s for Mac. :S"
,archermitch,2007-04-07T06:35Z,"Yeah this. Doesn't work. Followed the instructions perfectly. Opens in dock for about 5 seconds and goes back down. Any tips are greatly appreciated.

Also if anybody wants to know what mik6969 wrote in AVP2 it had to do with needing both discs, but it didn't work for me."
,archermitch,2007-04-07T06:37Z,Maybe it has to do with the Mac you have? I'm running 10.4.9... Is there a patch maybe?
,archermitch,2007-04-07T06:38Z,Are there any other NOLF 2 downloads at all?
,huthjonm,2007-04-11T02:08Z,"Problem.  When I mount the noCD file, there's nothing in it.  I also tried playing the game my mounting via toast the first disk image and playing, but it still asks me for the cd."
,LaZenMonk,2007-05-29T05:40Z,"Works great!! Thanks
  Locking the toast files before doing anything seems like a good idea."
,ReduxDengaku,2007-09-12T03:46Z,Done it 3 times through to the letter; says i need to install the CD & wont run at all.  Using Toast 8.0.1
,csabor69,2007-09-23T17:33Z,it doesnt work for me either. it seems like the no cd toast is empty.im using toast 8 titanium
,benihana856,2007-09-25T21:40Z,Could someone please seed!?!?!?!?!
,typeseven,2008-01-15T09:36Z,"cd2 is empty! am using toast, am following the instructions exactly : can anyone update this?"
,X-Pirate,2008-02-17T21:50Z,"Does anyone have the first No One Lives Forever? If you do, please upload a torrent to TPB. I'd use MSJ but, its been really unreliable the last few weeks."
,X-Pirate,2008-03-16T15:50Z,"Never mind, MSJ finally started working and I got it from there."
,bybullet,2008-05-14T19:21Z,"hello, i tried all :-( each time the application ask me to insert the cd. So i mounted CD1 : nothing, i mounted CD2 with Toast8 : nothing too.... plzzz help me !"
,slbm70,2008-06-24T01:22Z,highly convoluted process of getting it to work :p but when i did - it was most definately worth it! Thanks alot :)
,hocksrm,2009-03-02T17:13Z,"thanks, works fine"
,suuunly,2009-05-19T20:33Z,"How to get this game to work:

part 1:
Do everything that it's says in the guide except for mounting ""NOLF2noCD[k].toast"" with Toast.
(you must off course unstuffed the file: ""NOLF2noCD[k].toast"")

So instead of mounting it, just burn it on a empty CD disc with Disk utility (because the file is taking around: 600kb)

put the disc you burned in to the computer and start the game and you should be good to go :D"
,suuunly,2009-05-19T20:35Z,"How to get the game to work:

part 2:
tips/links:
the best program I know of for (in this case) unstuffing files is The Unarchiver:
http://wakaba.c3.cx/s/apps/unarchiver.html

and you can get Toast 10 titanium from here:

,underkill,2010-02-20T20:59Z,"mmm... game runs well visually, but I get no sound, which is really annoying. Any solutions?"
,csreddy,2010-12-14T13:53Z,please SEED!!! i know this is an old torrent but still... i'm stuck at 586 Mb(42%)...
,csreddy,2010-12-14T16:45Z,downloading at around 20 kbps...still better than nothing :) thankful to that one seeder..great job mate
,csreddy,2010-12-15T04:06Z,"stuck at 841 Mb(61%)...pls seed guys, i've got high speed internet but was only downloading at 6 kbps a while ago, and even thats stopped now.."
,cthielen,2011-05-02T00:29Z,"Mike,

I would REALLY appreciate some expertise here. I am completely uncertain of what to do. I am running on an Intel Core 2 Duo Macbook Pro. I am running OSX and have Snow Leopard. I installed the game just fine. I installed the patch just fine. However, when I attempt to unstuff the ""NOLF2noCD[k].toast.sit"" I get a message that reads as follows:

â€œNOLF2 noCD.toastâ€ couldnâ€™t be moved because you donâ€™t have permission to access â€œNOLF 2â€.

Can you please help me problem solve this? I would really appreciate the help. I don't know what to do. Thank you."
