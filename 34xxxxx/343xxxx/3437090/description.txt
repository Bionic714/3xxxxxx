Screen Virtuoso Pro 2.0 + Crack

ScreenVirtuoso enables you to record desktop activity and save the
clip as an AVI file, which can also be converted to MPEG 1/2
VCD/SVCD/DVD, SWF compatible formats (Pro Edition). The program can
limit recording to a selected window or a rectangle area on the
screen. Software also captures DirectX output properly, which can
often result in black screens during regular screen captures. It
allows you to record streaming videos from Internet or Media Player.
You can choose to record audio and optionally annotate a scene with
various shapes or speech bubbles. The program is easy to use; you can
pause/resume recording via keyboard hotkeys, and also adjust the
frame rate to achieve higher or lower quality videos.
