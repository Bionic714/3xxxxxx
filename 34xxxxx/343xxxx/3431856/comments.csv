,shady78,2006-01-15T16:08Z,im not sure i know fight night round 3 comes in march but other than that im not sure
,chronjohnson,2006-01-15T20:38Z,They stopped releasing new games.  You're expected to no longer use your XBox and play the 24 mediocre titles on the XBox 360 you don't have.
,Mortal Paladin,2006-01-16T02:19Z,"I know 25 to life comes out soon but whoever wants to play that game must have a short attention span. Also I think Torino 2006 should be out soon along with Painkiller which was awesome on the PC. Other then that there are a few budget games coming out but thats all=)

I'm waiting for Black and Bad Day L.A. "
