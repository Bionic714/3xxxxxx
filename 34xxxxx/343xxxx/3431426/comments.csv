Try this.

When you download and save on your disk a litle file with ectension *.torrent, you must double click on it, and torrent client will openned (in your case ""morpheus""). Then you must wait, that the client will conect with other people.
Please the other who knows english beter then me, explain him or. her."

Any info would be appreciated."
,Bobolink,2006-04-01T23:43Z,"MacLaddy - If U don't have already, D/L K-Lite codec bundle & VirtualDubMod.  Set VDM for 'Video': 'direct stream copy', split & save into separate files.  ISO Hunt & MiniNova forums have all this info...."

""what program do I need to open these torrent files, i am new to this. My computer does not recognize the program that created the file and is asking for me to connect to the web, please help.""

Open ""Google"", type ""Torrent"", and read every think about torrent.
Then type ""BitTornado"", download it and install.
Then double click downloaded file with extension *.torrent (downloaded from this site)
Then with your mouse tell the program where to download......."
,earthcreature,2006-07-22T21:35Z,"I did not get any sound when I opened the file with QuickTime (I was using a Mac). I was very disappointed. I then downloaded VLC Player, and THE SOUND WORKED! I was very happy! Thank you for the movie, it works PERFECTLY!!! ;)"
