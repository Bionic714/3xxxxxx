American Pie 3 - The Wedding.avi

This is an Edited version of the 802MB version:
The 802MB version has black strips top and bottom, and the whole image is strecthed vertically, which looks odd.

This version has been made using "Virtual Dub" 
http://virtualdub.sourceforge.net/
{
If you have virtual dub 
[it's free to download, good and doesn't even install anything to registry]
Use Settings:
Audio: Source, Direct Stream Copy
Video: Filters[Resize>720x300, Billenear, NOT INTERLACED; Cropping Y1=72,Y2=64]
	Compression[DivX 6.0 Codec,Home Theater Profile]
	Full Processing Mode
}

It has NO BLACK STRIPS, and is correct proportions so looks better.

Because the black strips are gone, and the video was squashed horizontally to get proportions right the size is reduced. The quality is comparable with the 802Mb version, but is MUCH more watchable due to the proportions!

The sound is never out of step with the video.

It is very widescreen [ 2.4 : 1 ] but the proportions are correct.

720 x 300 Pixels
1:35:49 long
Audio: 192k MP3
Video: DivX, 25fps, 118kbps, 24bit depth

Think that's all the important stuff, if not post a comment and i'll try to clarify
