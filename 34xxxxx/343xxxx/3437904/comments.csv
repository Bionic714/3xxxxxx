What about the Frames Per Second (FPS)?"
,FSSR.Keyno,2006-01-31T08:40Z,"NOOB huh? you're the NOOB not knowing huh much stuff you have that i uploaded(Emule), and when i say blow me DreamScenery, it stands, cause i paid for it."
,Mogz,2006-01-31T09:06Z,"Well Im sry if i stepped on your dick Keyno. And i Do know how much stuff i got from you and the rest of FSSR, and i do thank you for that. But your intiteled to your opinion just like everyone else is. my opinion is that it beats the hell out of that patchwork shit that MS calls scenery. To bad you paid for it becuz we didnt :)"
,FSSR.Keyno,2006-01-31T09:14Z,"Ok, so dont call me a NOOB and respect my opinion. Keep up the uploads, best wishes."
,allanssong,2006-01-31T11:39Z,"Kenyo, I thought it WAS funny. I was not being sarcastic....

I was laughing with you bud."
,PHBFO,2006-01-31T19:03Z,"BAD SCENERY!!!
Very ugly and the frames are so bad..."
,Nitrox_Diver,2006-02-01T10:01Z,"@FSSR.Keyno :
Why donÂ´t you upload here also? Would be more than great to have your FS-stuff here also and not just on the EMule!"
,Mogz,2006-02-01T17:14Z,"@keyno how did i disrespect your opinion? 2nd maybe this wouldnt have happened if youd just put your name on the readme, anyone could claim to have wrote it. not putting your name on it and complaining now is pretty noob like sry."
