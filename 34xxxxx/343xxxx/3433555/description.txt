Camtasia Studio Screen Recording and Presentation
Changing the way you train, present to, and connect with your audience.
Teaching and demonstrating visually is much more powerful than using words alone. But, getting the right group of people together for a training or demonstration can be expensive and inconvenient.

Camtasia Studio lets you easily create compelling training and presentations for Web and CD-ROM delivery, and you can do it without ever leaving your office.  It is the only product versatile enough to record live PowerPoint presentations, personalized technical training sessions, and rich software demonstrations.

Reach Anyone, Anytime
With the power of interactive Camtasia Studio videos, you can deliver the same high-quality information time and time again, to even your most remote client or student. This means that you can share your professional expertise with more of your audience. And, you can reclaim the time and expense of conducting in-person presentations to increase productivity in other areas of your professional life.

No Expertise Required
To create a video using Camtasia Studio, you don?t need multimedia expertise. Simply click the Record the screen button, and follow the steps in the New Recording Wizard to complete the recording. Using Camtasia Studio?s timeline and storyboard, you can then assemble your video, add and edit the audio and video tracks, and add callouts.
