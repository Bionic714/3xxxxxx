Young, talented and imaginative: this is the Italian prog band Algol3.

Thirty minutes of music in the vein of Italian classic progressive plus some interesting touches of power and heavy metal is what ?Emotivamente?, their second self-produced demo, has to offer, and the musicians really show great skilfulness and a strong harmony among them

I?m not fond of Italian lyrics but this time I have to admit they work out fine here, and the reason why stands in the singer?s ability to perform like a great actor. Just have a listen to the opener ?Bestia? (Beast) and you?ll hear how his voice is able to thrill, and even scare so easily you won?t mind that you probably have no idea what he?s talking about! The following title-track begins with some growl lines and goes on very fast with powerful drumming and strong guitars, always changing time and rhythm, while ?Recita? is a new-prog track that slows down a little bit. ?Tango Di Paura? features an interesting organ but the singer?s voice is, in my opinion, too high; ?Cercando La Mia Ombra? moves towards a symphonic direction, and sounds a lot like Symphony X, but the real surprise is its funky ending which makes this long track rather funny. 

The band is getting enthusiastic reviews from Italy and other European countries, and I totally agree with those who say these five guys will go very far. It?s not easy nowadays to find young bands with the same enthusiasm, innovating attitude, deep lyrics and technical skills. All I can say is I think Algol3 deserve to be discovered; right now they are attracting some local labels attention, and I?m sure they will soon come up with a great debut album!
