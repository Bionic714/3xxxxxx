,sj555,2006-05-28T19:20Z,Is someone able to help seed?  Stuck at 98%... so very close!  Please?  Thanks!
,mulrich,2006-06-06T21:50Z,"I tried ripping the DVD back onto my computer. It turns out that the CRC has changed a lot, so not even a complete rip from my DVD matches up to this version. It's a pity nobody else wants to seed this; I'd love to, but it would require that every single person that's stuck redownload the entire thing at a slow speed. I'm honestly and truly sorry."
