Real good movie!!!"
,rage against the machine,2007-04-09T21:48Z,LOL wtf? a dvd of this? history lesson: there were no dvds in the 80's.
,rage against the machine,2007-04-16T17:34Z,"btw, im seeding this for a long time. the video isnt that impressive, but its something every skater deserves to see. a time when skate vids actually had skaters doing runs of tricks, and not 50, 3 sec shots of them grinding a rail."

,superpipe,2011-06-26T18:04Z,Rock On.  Thanks so much for this.  This is why I love freedom.  Chk out skateboard kings to go even farther back with Alva and the Dogtown Boys.  I've got vhs copies Santa Cruz Speedballs and a 1987 NSA competition in Arizona.  Bill Danforth rockin' Pogo's.  Coming Soon
,superpipe,2011-06-26T18:10Z,Oh Yeah.  Good Quality copy considering the vintage.
