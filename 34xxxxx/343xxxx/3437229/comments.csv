,Sleighand,2007-10-05T04:38Z,I can't get the keygen to work. I clicked on it and nothing happens. I was expecting a window to come up with the key. Can anyone help? Thanks.

,BarryMic,2009-02-15T03:21Z,Antique version but it works. Kinda cool with the Windows98 look-I am running it on 64 bit Vista with no problems. There is an updated version somewhere on either here or BTj but I am going to use this one.
