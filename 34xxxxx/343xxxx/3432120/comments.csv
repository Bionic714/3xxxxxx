you need a bit of help.  It's really simple to rip songs to a very standard file naming system (at least this one has individual files!)  Include a text file instead of EVERY file name saying PCtorrent... and spell the song title out. PLEASE!  There are several ripping guides as well as any ripping software you could possibly want available here on Piratebay"
,JoonasD6,2006-04-01T15:26Z,That... is the most horrible naming of files I HAVE EVER SEEN! I'm vomiting over this torrent!

Hearing the voice of Frank Sinatra in Fly Me To The Moon and  The Way You Look Tonight, makes me feel so happy....
Thank you for this Torrent"
