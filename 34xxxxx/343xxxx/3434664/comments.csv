,JSP13,2012-08-25T03:03Z,"Hi. has anyone noticed that 2 lectures are missing from Day 4?  Based on the audio transcripts available elsewhere on the internet, Lecture 4 on Day 4 should be on the GI tract, and Lecture 5 should be on the GI tract and the hepatobiliary system.  However, in the files in the torrent, Lecture 5 is entirely missing, and Lecture 4 is a duplicate of Lecture 4 from Day 2.  Does anyone have Lecture 4 and Lecture 5 from Day 4?"
