,dmasterp,2009-05-17T10:02Z,"Just as YowzaTheBear said this is indeed an under rated movie.  I was watching Confidence and at the end of it I thought what is another good confidence or grifter movie besides The Sting and I remember Grifters which is a classic when it comes to con movies.  

Thanks for the upload."
