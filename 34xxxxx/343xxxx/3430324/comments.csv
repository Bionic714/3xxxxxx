This docu is very good! okay, maybe the author has a grutch against his old MEGA-religious school (I don't blame him). This docu shows the way the bible was written and it really let's you see why this is no more than a made-up book by diffrent authors. 10 points for this movie, I recommended lots of people to see it. Should be seen in every class world wide."
