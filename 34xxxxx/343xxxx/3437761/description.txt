Jackie meets the local star while at the salon with Fez: talk show host Christine St. George. Her new goal in life is to be Christines co-anchor on Whats Up Wisconsin, but breaking in to show business is harder than she thought it would be. She finally gets a job working with Christine, but its not quite the job she wanted. Randy wants to take Donna away to a cabin, which makes her suspect his intentions; Red takes Hyde to his Lodge, and Hydes intentions come under suspicion.
