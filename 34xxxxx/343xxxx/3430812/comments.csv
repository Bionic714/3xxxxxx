,aleistersenna,2009-08-03T21:48Z,thanks!!!
,yarmatey,2009-08-30T20:19Z,Audio is out of sync slightly. Annoying.
,Tovansky,2010-02-02T21:38Z,Thanks so much for this. I will seed as much as possible because I just completed it in a night. Quality is good for a film this old and nothing is wrong with it.
