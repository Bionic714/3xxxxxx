,Crag56,2006-05-10T14:29Z,Great program!
,Yuni,2006-05-19T08:28Z,"Helo. I cant find the serial number, please tell me where I can find it... Ty."
,Crag56,2006-05-19T12:39Z,"You will find it in this file:
OmniPage Pro 15 Office info.rtf"
,Yuni,2006-05-19T13:05Z,OIC. I dnt knw why I only got the ZIP file named OP15-II.zip... maybe I unnoticeably erased the other 2 files when I reformated my computer. How sad. Can I have the serial num instead? Or should I download it again? I'll look for the file first. I'll msg you again. Tnx.
,Yuni,2006-05-19T14:16Z,Found it. Tnx a lot. I rli appreciate it.
,Crag56,2006-05-19T20:06Z,No problem! :)
,walfrieda,2006-09-15T01:13Z,"Hi Crag56,
does this version require product activation? I already have a copy downloaded from somewhere else which requires activation after 5 launches of the program. What about your's?"
,Crag56,2006-10-24T18:33Z,"Yes it does, but there is a serial key in the download!"
,rednova,2006-10-27T15:17Z,"After putting in the serial number, Omni asks for the activation number.  Without the activation number, it says it will work only 5 times.  What am I doing wrong?"
,Crag56,2006-10-28T13:39Z,Try putting in the serial key again.
,rednova,2006-10-28T20:57Z,"Hi, Crag:

Did a fresh install with the serial number provided.  Same bad result.  It gives me 5 free tries only.  It keeps asking for internet activation with machine imprint.  Keygen anyone?  Help."
,rednova,2006-10-28T22:48Z,Crag:  Disregard prior message.  It works.  Great stuff and it includes Scan Soft's PDF-to-Word converter.  Thanks.
,Blue Dog,2006-12-09T07:44Z,Thanx for the program.
,johnto,2007-01-01T18:24Z,"Hi Crag,
Can I activate this software?
Thanks"
,stefos30,2007-02-04T13:03Z,Excellent! Thanks Craig
,kevlarsnake,2007-02-06T21:18Z,"does anyone have the Vista software update for this program,!...:)http://www.nuance.com/vista/"
,Captain113,2007-02-12T00:07Z,To get the Vista update you have to register with a serial number.  Has anyone been successful at this?
,Captain113,2007-02-12T02:29Z,Not able to obtain a Vista download with that serial number.  That program is a network program and has to go through a phone call from a network administrator.  If you have Vista I guess you are out of luck.  Anyone have the Vista download???
,Crag56,2007-03-02T17:41Z,Doesn't seem to work with Vista. Try using the serial included in this file: OmniPage Pro 15 Office info.rtf
,Crag56,2007-03-02T17:41Z,"Doesn't seem to work with Vista. Try using the serial included in this file: OmniPage Pro 15 Office info.rtf

Johnto: The serial is in ""OmniPage Pro 15 Office info.rtf"""
,Acbeer,2007-03-26T21:45Z,"Thanks for uploading this good program.
I was searching for it."
,sedgee,2007-07-07T17:16Z,Crag56 and seeders thank you.
,MagiciansFR,2007-07-12T22:43Z,Somebody PLEASE post the VISTA upgrade! A complete repost with the Vista agrade and working serial numbers would be great too.
,Lappen59,2007-08-01T17:54Z,Thanks
,spiit,2007-08-13T12:12Z,"lol, stop complaining about vista upgrades, just go back to whats always been working. xp ;)"
,donotmistakeme,2007-10-20T11:47Z,"Hi friends
I cant find the serial number, please tell me. "
,My_expat,2008-01-16T10:18Z,"I have a cracked version of this version.
I'm not sure if the serial number will work on others, but you may try E709X-K01-NHXD-QQDF-F8.
Plz let me know if it works....

If it doesn't work, I don't mind to upload my version, but I just hate to see too many torrents of the same floating around..."
,silky69,2008-04-28T01:40Z,"This IS a  cracked version.....Thanks Crag56, works great, saved my ass at work I can tell ya!"
,inflatable-hammer,2008-05-20T04:55Z,"I still have windows ME, and would appreciate it very much if someone can please seed an older version of the program.  Versions 14 and 15 are not compatable with Win ME..

Thanks"
,hfmstde,2008-06-10T16:02Z,"thanx - good clean version, the key E709X-K01-NHXD-QQDF-F8 works fine"
,JohnBaptist,2008-10-19T22:12Z,"Use the serial. It works. Than activate automaticaly, and NOT manualy"
,KC692,2008-11-10T01:03Z,"I hope I didnt mess up. When I installed it, the product activation page  came up and I clicked remind me in 7 days, another window tiwh 2 lines talking about mechanical footprints and serial numbers came up and I just closed it because I didnt know what to do. I think there was a generate activation button or something similar underneath. I used the serial number my_expz"
,KC692,2008-11-10T01:06Z,"I used the serial number my_expat used. Am I seriously messed up the next time I open it ? The installwizard is NOT closing even though I have clicked finish numerous times. I am new at this, and the comment to register it automatically and not manually confused me. Can anyone clarify my position here? Am i relegated to 5 uses, and then scansoft bars my machine from their software or what?"
