,JoakimLj,2006-05-25T22:47Z,"braindead666!!

Fel, det är inte virus!
Jag har testat det med flera virus program och hittat inget.

Sen är det 267 nerladdningar ingen av dem har sagt något!"

När jag laddade ner spelet blev det bara en massa filer som det inte går att öppna. Vad är det jag behöver för att dem ska funka? Hjälp någon?
----------------------------------------------------

Det är säkert .rar filerna. Då måste skaffa winrar(http://www.rarlab.com/) eller winzip ( http://www.winzip.com/), sedan packa upp dem. 
När du packat upp dem så kommer en .iso fil tror jag, hursomhelst så måste du bränna den på en cd med alcohol 120% eller ett vanligt brännar program. 

eller så kan du också mounta, men det är för jobbigt och förklara om du inte vet hur man gör!

Fast då ska du välja typ bränn imagine fil eller något liknande. Då bränner den till en cd, sen när det är klart så kan du stoppa in cd:n och installera sen spela :P"

,Kduff1,2007-04-16T09:40Z,"Okay, I installed the game, everything worked fine.  I was playing, tweaking the game, and decided I should upate the game.  So I hit the auto-update button, and it starts downloading, and finishes.  It closes the application, and tries to install the update, but all that happens is that a black box appears and show a bunch of text.  Next thing I know, I can't run the game, I can't uninstall it, and I can't reinstall it.  Complete meltdown.

So, I did a system restore back to when I first installed it, and everything seems to be working fine.  However, I don't know if maybe the latest update has some security feature that may detect false versions.  I just wanted to warn anyone out there, and possibly this will help someone if they have the same problem.  I'm going to try and update it manually, and I'll post whether I have any problems with that."
,mushi1,2007-04-16T09:50Z,kduff if i was you i wouldn t get updates because it is pirated version and these companies have security features which look at your ip address and remember it aswell as your serial code and location and can esayly get you busted they spend more money on against illeagel copies then the game
,AgnosticIconoclast,2007-04-18T04:56Z,"This is a fantastic torrent, it works perfectly 100%.

For anyone having trouble, I've decided to write a little tutorial on how to install it (as I myself had a time figuring out how to do it).

1. Download the torrent.
2. Navigate to the folder where it is saved, and double-click it. Next, open the folder called CD1.
2. Unrar the first RAR file in the folder using WinRAR, available at www.rarlabs.com. Repeat this step for the first RAR files in the CD2 and CD3 directories as well.
3. Next you'll need a program to mount the image files, I used IsoBuster (http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3606269/IsoBuster_Pro_v1.9.1.1_.Final.Cracked-GMSi%5BSEED). Open and extract each of the .bin files you just unRARed to a folder you'll be able to find later. There should be 3 .bin files, one from each of the CD1, CD2, and CD3 directories.
4. Once you've extracted all the files using IsoBuster (or similar program), go there. In each of the folders from the 3 separate image files you'll find another RAR file. UnRAR all files in these packages to the same directory, but make sure to put them in the folder where the original image file was extracted. (For example, if you extracted the .bin file in the CD1 folder to C:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\AoE3\AoE III Disc 1, then unpack all the files contained within the 3 separate RAR packages to the same folder).
5. Once done, run the setup.exe file.
6. During the installation process, you will be asked for a serial code. Use the following serial: DXR32-X44M7-CYTCX-P6H6P-97CPG
7. Once the game finishes installing, go into the Crack folder contained within the initial image file, and copy the file called age3.exe into the directory where Age of Empires III was installed (typically C:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\Age of Empires III). It will ask you if you want to overwrite the file with the same name that already exists, click Yes.
Ta-da, you're done! Enjoy playing AoE3 and thanks to whoever provided this amazing torrent!"

,Sinsear,2007-04-28T09:18Z,"This game technically doesn't work 100% (which is expected of all pirated copies). You CANNOT get online with this game, nor can you get updates for the game. To me, this basically ruins the whole point of the RTS because online play is crucial. Imagine not being able to play starcraft online and just constantly playing with the computer. It gets pretty boring. Same thing here. Also, the story is pretty weak anyways (you can read a book about colonization) so the campaign isn't that special. Basically an RTS's value is people versus people, so you lose that aspect in this version."

Unrar it then you will end you with 2 files for each cd

-3 Image

Use Daemon and mount the first img file named 

rld-aoea

It should to start the install and later on in the install it will ask for cd 2 in this case you will need to mount rld-aoeb and click ok after that it will ask for you guessed it cd 3 wich is named rld-aoec then click ok and it will do the rest

But the last step copying the cracked  executable from the / crack dir on cd1 to your installation dir

2.Download and Install DAEMON lite tools, the newest one
3.Open the CD1 folder and make sure to have winRAR, if not download and install winRAR, google it like DAEMON lite tools.
4.Open the first winRAR file and then extract the one file named BIN to the desktop or where you can locate it easily the file named CUE with go along with it.
5.Then on the icon of the DAEMON lite tools right-click and where Virtual CD/DVD ROM is follow the arrow until it says mount image.
6.Locate the file that you extracted and mount it and install the first CD, follow this step until your done with CD3.
7.Now the file called REloaded right click and highlight ""Open With"" choose Notepad to get the CD key
8.Now mount CD1 again and click on the start>computer
9.When that opens right click on the CD drive with the age of empires logo and choose ""Explore"".
10.The file Crack should be there drag and drop it to the desktop or any where you can easily locate it and save it there.
11.Now open the file Crack and right click copy and open start>computer and go to C:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\Age of Empires III and copy, and overwrite the old one and now your are 90% complete.
12.Now go to www.gamecopyworld.com and navigate to locate a file called ""Age Of Empires 3 v1.12[English/German] No-CD/Fixed EXE"".
13.Now go to the Age of Empires Offical site and download the new v1.12 offical patch and download and install it.
14.Now unRAR the file you download from www.gamecopyworld.com and do the same thing as step 10-11.
15.Finally you can run and enjoy the game with out any need for CDs or slowdowns due to lack of reading a disc :)!!!  Special thanks to uploader ""samehzone"" :D, people who help seeded, and Someone else who helped me to get this game running, and help you to run this game the way it was meant to be played.

If any other way is done feel free to try it, im just helping out others who have no clue what to do.

Have fun and enjoy!!"

,Roihu,2008-06-21T01:30Z,"Maybe I have a fucked up computer.
When I downloaded it, everything was pretty great.
The game opened okay with the opening in perfect quality and all that shit.
But... then it took 15 minutes to get to the main menu, and that was because I kept pressing escape.
Then, on the main menu, not only was it slow, but...well, I don't know how to explain it, but it was fucked up. (If I were to, I think I'd say it looks like a lot of triangles pointing to the middle.

,james77bone,2008-07-11T23:36Z,"'  you need a crack. First check the game version, and get the crack that matchs your game version. few things that can make crack doesnt work:
1. most cracks are very old like 2 or 3 years, and wont work with the latest OS.
2. some games require you to emulate cd images, using virtual cd porgram, like alcohol 120% or deamon tools.

Check this site for cracks:

-3 Image

Use Daemon and mount the first img file named 

rld-aoea

It should to start the install and later on in the install it will ask for cd 2 in this case you will need to mount rld-aoeb and click ok after that it will ask for you guessed it cd 3 wich is named rld-aoec then click ok and it will do the rest

But the last step copying the cracked executable from the / crack dir on cd1 to your installation dir

Do I have to mount all of those files???
Sum1 please tell me!"
,machasdo,2009-01-12T16:44Z,"What you do is once you're done downloading, you go to the AOE III folder and open the CD1 folder...in it you'll find many .rar files, double click on any one of them and WinRAR will open (if you have it installed on your PC) then in the WinRAR Window you'll find a rdl-aoea.bin folder.
What you do is you click on the ""Up one level"" button on the top right corner next to the folder name and select all the .rar files and extract to a folder on your desktop or wherever.
Do the same for CD2 and CD3 folder.

After you've done that, go to the taskbar and find the Daemon Tools icon on it, right click> Virtual CD/DVD-rom> Device 0:...> Mount Image.
Now you're going to mount the image that you extracted, use the autorun feature...install and play :D

Hope this helped"

,Asad989,2009-01-13T00:04Z,"Guide-
Part 1
Things you'll need-
1.Some torrent program to download file ( i used bitorrent)
2.Winrar( to unrar the files that i tell you to unrar)
3.Daemon Tool (to mount the cue files)
Steps-
1.Download torrent
2.Once its done go to your desktop (or wherever you downloaded it to) and open it and go to CD1 folder.
2A.In the CD1 folder you'll see A LOT of files but don't get scared XD. Look for a file called rld_aoea BUT make sure that the file your looking at says RAR file but doesn't have a rar image on it. Click it and use winrar to open it. Once its opened drag the 2 files you see in it
rld-aoea.bin rld-aoea.cue
3.Now go to your desktop lets say and make some folder with any name and drag those 2 files into it.
4. Now repeat step 2A and 3 for CD2 and CD3 but instead of rld_aoea it'll say aoeb then aoeb. 
NOTE-After you have opened the first rar file in CD1 wiht no name when you look in CD2 and 3 you'll see a similar file with the same icon that shows a white box outside of the rar image.
5. Ok now should should have 6 files in that folder you made. Those files should be
rld-aoea.bin rld-aoea.cue rld-aoeb.bin rld-aoeb.cue rld-aoec.bin rld-aoec.cue
If you have all those files in your folder good..
6. Now all that is left is some simple installing.
Go to your Daemon tools control panel and (if you have DAEMON Tools Lite) there should be a small orange ball with a arrow pointing up click that and click Device0: [F:] NOTE- It may be different depending on your system. Now a little window should come up saying ""Select Image File"" now navigate your way to that folder where you dropped the 6 files and click the one that says
rld-aoea.cueand it should mount it.
"
,Asad989,2009-01-13T00:05Z,"Part 2
7. Ok now the installation window for Age of Empires should come and ask you for a code before you can install. Pick any on of these
I reccomend-
DXR32-X44M7-CYTCX-P6H6P-97CPG 
These might work-
WPXD8-7XYFR-4828Q-FV88X-7DGDJ
JKK3F-J8CK9-Q33PF-W88FY-MGBBT
After that it'll start installing and your good til..
7A- IT ASKS YOU FOR CD2!! Don't freak out ok
Just go to Daemon Tools again and this time mount rld-aoeb.cue and it should continue installing.
7B- Near the end it'll ask you to put in CD3 so this time mount the last one rld-aoec.cue
There you go, where almost done, when it finishes it'll ask you to restart your computer do it. NOTE-It MIGHT ask you to put in CD1 again after installation finishes this isn't a bug but a DirectX update for the game and more. So just mount rld-aoea.cue again.
"
,Asad989,2009-01-13T00:13Z,"Part 3
8. Congrats if you made it this far. To play the game your gonna need to put in the crack so it doesn't need the disc. To do this you can go to gamecopy world and find the file or use the one from CD1 which i coudln't find so i used the game copy world one"
,Asad989,2009-01-13T00:14Z,"9. IF YOU USED TEH GAME COPY ONE- Now navigate to where you installed the game (by default its C:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\Age of Empires III) And cut and paste the AGE3.exe file into this folder when it asks you to replace say yes.
How can i help you? Read below and go to http://www.moddb.com/games/lemmingball-z and vote for that game ( voting closes on 16th January 2009)
NOTE- To keep this alive plz copy and paste it so everyone from here on knows what to do k ( and give me credit)

Now I typed the 'XXXXXX' to fill up the serial box.. it didn't work. So now what ?? I'm not seeing the crack directory neither but that's not a problem I can fix that myself but I really do need a serial key.. 

How did you guys solve that one ? Let me know please, thank you ! "

,ddamager,2009-03-08T00:02Z,"OK PEOPLE! Heres what you have to do. 

1. Search through comments on how to install the files and what programs you have to install to do so.

2. Search through Google for the crack.

3. Look after a comment that sais where tu put the crack. 

4. If you see a text coming up when trying to play the game that sais Cant load file DATAP.BAR, go to Programs\Microsoft Games\ Age of Empires 3 and search for a folder, or file, named data or something similar. Drag the data.bar file into the installation folder and rename it to whatever the text that pops up says thats missing. For instant, my file was in a folder, i renamed it from data.bar to DATAP.BAR and draged it out. WORKED! On some of you, it might be called data2 or datax, but it always comes with a .bar after it. You MUST make sure that the name you give it is the same as the name that comes up on the screen!"

most torrents that you get don't allow you to play online multiplayer, if you want that feature you usually have to buy the game. But with some games it's different so that may be your problem and it may not. Hope I helped!"

,ThePalindorme,2009-12-21T18:27Z,"Ok. This torrent works. And for the complete noobs the installation instructions:-
1. You need Daemon tools, winrar, and LOTS OF SPACE on your hard drive.  (use google for the softwares)
2. Extract using winrar. Double click on one file in the cd folders downloaded via torrent, then extract and voila you get 1 bin file and for CD1 And CD2 an image file  .cue,  as well.
3. Ignore the cue file, its useless and mount the bin file using daemon tools. for that, you see the task bar on the bottom right, right click on the red and white lightning symbol-> virtual cd/dvd rom -> device X is empty->mount image.
You need to select 'all files' in the pop up window to use the bin file.
4. Do for the remaining two cds appropriately
5. Use the CD key, it works. Make sure you are typing all in capitals, and be careful not to add typos and mistakes. Still not working, then google for other cd keys.
6. follow the instructions of installation.
7. After installation, use crack on the cd1 to replace the original AOE3 icon in its folder you decided during installation.
Thats it."
,ThePalindorme,2009-12-21T18:38Z,"Age of empires 3 is well, fantastic. I was a big fan of AOE 2 and it was the first RTS i played.
After that i couldnt get used to other rts's and waited for another RTS like aoe 2. Well, i got aoe 3 now. Its works similar to its ancestor, and progresses in many ways making it the best RTS ever. 
Pros- Extreme textures and level design, Outstanding graphics. Great singleplayer and multiplayer (which we cant play yet). Long play time. Great voice cast. Great story, cutscenes, gameplay and what not.
Cons- Requires a strong graphics card almost at par with crysis, for best visual show. Its necessary to enjoy the game at its best. Occupies lots of space. Thats about it. Ah, yes, its also prone to crashing on intel graphics card.
For those having intel grahics card of g33/g31 crap, turn off lightning effects in options-> graphics. that should make it playable."

get daemon tools.
Once you have downloaded the whole torrent. EXTRACT using 7 zip or winzip , or unrar.. any program like that. Then, extract the rldaoea.rar in each CD folder. it should come out a .bin file and a .cue file
Using daemon tools. Make a virtual drive and put the .cue file from cd one onto it. Then auto run the drive and install. Voila your done :) "
