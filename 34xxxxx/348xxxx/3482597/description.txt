In this highly anticipated next installment in the Age of Empires franchise
from Ensemble Studios, Age of Empires III places players in the time period
of roughly 1500?1850, picking up where Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings
left off. As players work to establish their empire, they take on the role
of a European power struggling to explore, colonize, and conquer North and
South America.

Age of Empires III introduces exciting new gameplay elements, including the
all-new Home City and an incredible combat system. Players have new
civilizations to discover, random maps to conquer, and a single-player
campaign unlike any other. Players also find stunning graphics as a result
of a revolutionary graphics engine that pushes the limits of PC graphics
technology in an entirely new way.
