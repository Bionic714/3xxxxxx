SID4.0 NKnave edition from xbox HQ

This is the long waited release of SID 4, this small file will have all your gamesaves needed, including the Linux Launcher, THIS IS THE FIXED DOWNLOAD WITH THE PPFX.LST FILE.

Projects for SID4 and my own softmod Installer has lead me to attempt to use all features and most updated hacks and software for the use of softmods, having the first softmod EVER to dissable unlocking your HDD, breaking it, loosing your dash, and other features, please visit this thread for more info here on the Official Thread

Features:
-Uses UnOfficial Nkpatcher 11, Official Nkpatcher10.
-Takes full advantage of nkpatcher with virtual mounts.
-Smart Scripting, to make stuff easy and to the point.
-Single boot for those who just wants their xbox modded.
-Dual Boot Gamesave, where open tray = softmod installer, no mounts.
-Dual Boot Ndure, where open tray = retail mode, and safe to go on Xbox Live!
Of course you must have an account made before you install the softmod, or you'll never get to make one after.

Super Features:
-Once mod state nkpatcher is loaded, it will mount shadowC, hidding true C files.
-MS Dash will be avialable in virtual C, and you'll only see retail files.
-Rescuedash enabled. If you format your HDD, or simply delete your dash files, this will
appear with a black screen and some info about the problem, i call it "ERROR 22", but with the press of "A" it will restore your dashboard installed from softmod, and reboot to it safely.
-Virtual EEPROM, with edited values to PREVENT applications from unlocking your HDD!!!!
SOMETHING THAT WILL MAKE SURE CONFIGMAGIC AND OTHER PROGRAMS WILL NEVER UNLOCK YOUR HDD, AND LEAD YOU TO "ERROR 05"!!!
-Leading to the safest softmod ever!!!

Things to know:
-Dashboard targets supported are:
- e:dashdefault.xbe
