John 'OO' Fleming in the studio! 
Anyone buy this months Future Music magazine? There is a 78 minute quicktime movie on John 'OO' Fleming in the studio showing you how he recently remixed The Flash Brothers new tune! 

It is actually very educational movie and to see how he completes a remix down to every fx, hat and loop created! The guy is a bloody genius and just watching this as made me realise how much work goes into a remix - from a pro's point of view! His studio is pretty cool having what you'd expect, but the Alesis Andromeda certianly got my attention!

Worth checking out if you can get a copy!
