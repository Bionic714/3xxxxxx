,Evil_Sofa,2007-02-05T08:01Z,I disagree with the review. I found it a wonderful refreshing recond in comparison to the shit that was coming out around the same time.

Anyone saying this isn't a good record should be empaled, or be called ignorant, whatever. "

Makes no sense if you ask me, let people form their own opinions about the music, rather than make it sound like it's not worth downloading when in the minds of the people who decided not to download it because of your review it would actually be a briliant album.

I haven't listened to more than Hooks & Splinters, but I imagine that it's a good album form a very unique band."

,winksy,2009-01-13T08:23Z,Great! Loved it.
