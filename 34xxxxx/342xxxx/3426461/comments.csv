You can also find this files uploaded to youtube, and the qoulity isn't much worst there either. (The sound maybe is, but i don't think it worths 450 MBs.)

For some reason the 1st episode kicked out of VLC on me a couple of minutes in.  But it played fine in MPC.

Thanks for the effort to make this available, since the PTB let us down."
