Why is it so necessary to hardwire into these videos spanish subtitles? You feel the need to make it easy for others who can't read, speak or write english to watch, fine, but for the love of God STOP EMBEDDING THEM TO WHERE THEY CAN'T BE TURNED OFF!!!!

To me, subs are as annoying as a fly buzzing around your face that won't go away or watching television that keeps going dark every five seconds...what's the point!!!

Make TPB beautiful and stop the incessent insertion of unremovable subtitles. If you - or I for that matter, don't understand the language, that's life but why ruin the video with subtitles anyway? How about just don't upload?"
