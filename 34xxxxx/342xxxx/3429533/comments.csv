,[k],2006-01-09T23:21Z,"""Well thnx a lot ratinaz, no matter which one you do first, as long as we get them all,"" yes I would like that too, only problem is that I'm stuck at Disc 310, could anyone please help me out? Seed for a while? Pliiiiiiizz?"
,darkcell,2006-01-10T14:04Z,"[k], I am seeding 310. "
,darkcell,2006-01-11T10:13Z,"Prospero, I'm seeding all of season 3, with no cap, and won't be stopping anytime soon. I only have 100k up so it may take a while, but you will get your bits. And there are others out there that will help out more when they have 409 and 410, I'm sure. Don't worry."
,Prospero,2006-01-12T17:28Z,Thanks darkcell. What do you mean with no cap?
,darkcell,2006-01-12T19:43Z,"With ""no cap"" I meant that I'm not limiting the upload speed in favor of 409/410 anymore. But I still only have 100k up total, of course ..."

,rernst,2008-11-12T05:33Z,"Forget all these 'untouched' torrents. I have a super high speed connection and have been waiting for days for this idiot to emerge and seed. He's probably sitting there and grinning while the rest of us try to download a single byte.

Haha, yes, he managed to waste my time."
