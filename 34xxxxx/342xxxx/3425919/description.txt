This is the biggest collection of Disney music available as a torrent. Version 1.0 of this collection includes 41 albums, comprising 58 CDs, 1073 songs, 52 hours and 40 minutes of music. Almost every file contains album art embedded. All files were encoded using iTunes 6.1 using the MPEG4 AAC VBR 128kbps format, which results in high quality audio in much less space. The files are M4A format, which is not protected, and can be played in WinAmp through the use of a small plugin. The files are directly compatible with all iPods. This version contains the latest park music from both Disneyland and Disney World. [English] [2005]
