,XeLoR,2006-01-07T18:51Z,"This is not working for me to extract, I don't know if you need disc 1 or something. But if you only DL this, it wont work! Be aware!"
[V],BilloWillo,2006-01-07T21:33Z,"This has nothing to do with disc 1, this is a totaly separate thing. It is as simple as it gets.. I dont know what extraction program you use but if you use Winrar and then mout the iso in daemon tools or burn it it works just fine. Do you really think I would release something whithout testing it first?!"
,sandhewra,2006-01-08T10:03Z,Thank you very much :)
,davsmith20,2006-05-18T01:14Z,"I had to  Highlight all the rar files in winrar and ""right click"" and select ""repair"" because it said there was a fault with the Authentication of the files . It then repaired ALL 68 files and then i was able to  extract them with Winrar  resulting in an ISO file that i burnt with nero ( or you could further extract the files with isobuster resulting in the usual  VOB , IFO files then burn with Nero.

The DVD then played perfectly"
