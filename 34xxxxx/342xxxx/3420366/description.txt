Ok, after all the hassle of the previous ISO not working and all the many pissed  off people out there. I have remade the Torrent & ISO and burnt it with Nero and then played it with PowerDVD. Guess what.......It works.........................
I have also verified the file with Azureus and the Integrity check went well.

So you ask, will it work..... Without sending copies to your home i dont know what else to do.

The quality is very good and the DVD ISO is complete with nothing left out. 
I think i've covered most questions that will crop up. All i ask is that you refrain from pissing me off by complaining and moaning. I have a life outside of this and work hard and i'm not always in the country so cannot answer questions right away. I try and do what i can for the torrent community, much like the many other hard working people who use this site, PLZ respect this. 

PHEW!!!!! Sorry to moan....

Enjoy the upload.
