,Cloud_Strife_9999,2006-01-24T21:00Z,How the hell do I find my machine code?!? the keygen keeps asking me to put a machine code in and I've looked around and I can't figure out what it means!! I've tried the sticker on my case. It's presented like this C-1000-1000-1000-1000 any help on this would be greatly appreciated
,Tomtrek,2006-01-28T22:34Z,"I am having problems with the registration.

I put in the Serial no. the keygen suggests, then it tells me to Register it, but when I choose ""Register vis internet"", it is never able to connect."
,QuorumCall,2006-01-30T21:07Z,Use the serial number thats already written in the keygen for the first prompt. Then register by phone.
,cedemera,2006-01-31T07:59Z,It dosenÂ´t work with the keygen..and the suggested serail like:  0496326714978222. Can someone please give me a proper working serial? Thanx in advance!!
,Tomtrek,2006-01-31T16:54Z,"Thanks QuorumCall, it now works. :-D

It was the register by phone option that confused me."
,knylol,2006-02-02T12:30Z,What is the password ?
,QuorumCall,2006-02-07T01:02Z,You're welcome. :)
,QuorumCall,2006-02-07T01:03Z,"The password is the in the box labled ""Serial Number"" in you keygen."
,wahawk2006,2006-02-09T03:47Z,"how do you register by phone? it says use the number in the handbook. what is it talking about?
 and what do we put in the for the registration code slash other information?"
,mecobio,2006-02-13T17:57Z,"Which number to type here since neither the serial number, nor Machine code, nor the registration code works. Thanks in advance"
,mecobio,2006-02-13T18:51Z,"for the Registration number via phone, I meant"
,QuorumCall,2006-02-16T09:27Z,"First prompt asks for password: use ""Serial Number"" from the KEYGEN.

Sibelius opens. Select and copy number in the bottom right of the window which begins with ""C"" followed by sixteen numbers in groups of four."
,QuorumCall,2006-02-16T09:28Z,"
Paste this into the ""Machine Code"" field in you KEYGEN.

Click GENERATE.

Click REGISTER BY PHONE.

Paste in the MACHINE CODE you GENERATED on you KEYGEN."
,californiafraser,2006-02-28T08:06Z,"hey, my installation wont work.  it gets stuck on one of the first things, something like SibeliusFonts/opus.ttf

,DarthChryss,2006-04-02T08:50Z,Where i can find kontakt player GOLD?
,DeAnOroX,2006-04-14T18:33Z,"In reference to the special note, i'm freakin stupid.
I clicked yes.
Anyway, I deleted ALL of Sebilius 3 and 4, then reinstalled 4, but still, the Serial in the keygen and the Serial in the registration part of Sebilius don't match, and I can't change them,
PLEASE help. It says it' hard to get a new one into it, how do it do it?"
,VaGa_sc,2006-04-17T23:10Z,"I think we should change the question by now...

The question is,
""Where can we find 'Sibelius Edition of Garritan Personal Orchestra'? ""

Can we find the torrent in this site? What do you think? But 'Kontakt Player Gold' is welcome anyway :)"

Does anyone happen to know a cause or solution to this problem? Thanks..."
,DaPuzzler,2006-04-28T04:05Z,"Just answered my own question, about why the installer was freezing while copying files. I had another application, called puTTY, running. It's an ssh client. As soon as I closed that app, the installer proceeded fine. "

,johnnylangridge,2006-05-29T21:04Z,"There is no prompt for me to enter the ""serial number"". The serial number is then different in the keygen than in Sibelius. I've using the registration code which the KeyGen produced using my machine code but if didn't work.

How do I get the right serial number into sibelius in the first place?

thanks."
,obuibo,2006-08-01T02:30Z,"To replace the serial number, run regedit in the command line and modify the data portion of HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Sibelius Software\Sibelius 4\SerialNumber. Copy and paste from the Registration Code generator."

,Ghost_1500,2006-10-28T00:08Z,"I solved the machine code issue on my own, I simply misread the instructions provided by others, lol.  But I am now hitting the issue of registering, as I cannot seem to connect to the internet and do not have the manual in order to register by phone.  How have others solved this?"
