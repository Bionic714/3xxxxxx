Maybe it's just me, and I only have about 90% of the torrent, but some tracks sound like they've been substituted with heavy metal rock and others sound like a TV playing in the background. If anyone got 100% of the download and it sounds fine to them (ie: ALL Derek & Clive), please post a comment."
