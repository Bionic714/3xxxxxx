,mikethejones,2006-01-09T23:54Z,"I think you are supposed to drag the whole savage folder to applications first.  I really don't remember, as I haven't installed it in a long time.  I hated the game."

,Tobee,2006-02-14T22:18Z,Is it possible to play as beast with this one?
,Sunal,2006-02-28T01:55Z,"Yes and there is another way to make this work without a key.

Once you install it and it asks for the key put in the letters ""SAV"" and then disconect from the iternet (But don't close the window) Press continoue or ok and a message will come up sayin somethin about cannot connect to the internet.  Reconect yourself THEN press continue (Do not press cancle).  Wola, yu now are on.  I havent done it in a while but you might need to do it when ever you start it up."
