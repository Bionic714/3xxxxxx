Twisted dark futurism:

A masterwerk of brooding menace, mystical melodies, outerspace discotronix, gonzo click-whirr breaks, sculpted noise, and grooves that limp and shuffle forth from the shadows like broken clockwork toys in a deserted mansion.

Synth stabs, relentless chomping beats. This is cartoon music for the post-postmodern era.

Hello,

My name is Zenpho, I've been making electronic music for years.

I love sitting down in my studio and experimenting with chaining processing hardware and running recursive software processes, to munge and distort audio making new sounds.

Around 3 years ago (that makes it 2002) I put together this album as a result of such experiments.
Its not all ambient washes of noise, there are melodies, beats and grooves too. Dip in, i'm sure you'll enjoy it.

All of the mp3s in this .torrent are availiable to BUY from iTunes, or from CDBaby.com
