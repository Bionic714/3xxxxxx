Very early recording from Kingston Jamaica with lots of feeling, but the sound is not so good, i think the famous man at the mixer "Lee 'scratch' Perry was under the spell of ganja as the rest of the gang ( and their equipment wasn't the best either ) 
I dig this more than his later recordings because the feeling is so great.
