Waco: A New Revelation is the film that triggered a new Congressional investigation
of the Waco tragedy, and caused the Justice Department and the FBI to reverse their
long-held positions on Waco. It has generated a firestorm of events unprecedented in the history of documentary filmmaking.

After six years of painstaking investigation, the complete story of the tragedy in
Texas is finally coming to light. This compelling feature-length documentary presents new revelations about the events that led up to the deaths of 79 men, women and children at Mount Carmel on April 19, 1993. Waco: A New Revelation presents evidence addressing the following questions:
Mount Carmel on April 19th, 1993.

* Why didn't the Branch Davidians and their children come out of the Mount Carmel
compound?
* Did the FBI actually start the Waco fire using pyrotechnic devices?
* Why was critical evidence missing from the evidence locker nearly six years
after the event?
* What was the role of the elite U.S. Army Delta Force during the final assult
-- and why was their presence denied untill now?
* Does the trail of evidence lead to the first lady Hillary Clinton, President
Clinton and the White House?
