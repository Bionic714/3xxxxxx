Holy something hot as hell. They dont come much more easy than this one on this side of life. Its time to open that martini bottle, or maby a simple gin tonic, just remember, nobody ever died of to many umbrellas on a longdrink. 

And I can not seed this very long, 2-3 days. Its Xmas and Ill have to leave for some holliday fun with my fam, with Dean Martin on the stereo and yellow and green drinks on the table. If anyone with good uploadpower would keep this masterpice up for a week or two it would be awesome.
