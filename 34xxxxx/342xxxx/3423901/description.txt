XMAS edition of Interpose,
a stunningly fast scrolling action
game.  The action - and that DOES mean
action! - takes place in space.  Shoot
3D enemy ships while conserving energy
and fire-power. This is DOS games on its best.

Complete with DOSBox and all configfiles. Just run dosbox.exe, you migt want to adjust CPU throttle if the game shutters (CTLR + F11 / F12)

Merry XMAS
