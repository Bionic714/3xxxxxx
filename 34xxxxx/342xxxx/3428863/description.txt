Jaguar xj220 (U)[SEGA CD]

A simple but fun car racing, supports two player splitscreen to double the fun with a friend. Superb soundtracks. Play it on an emu.

Note: One of the mp3 file is corrupt and will hang the game. I don't know which one. When you know which then just don't play that tune or replace it with your custom tune or repair it.
