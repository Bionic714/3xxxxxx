,Pirate 32,2006-01-08T21:25Z,That makes a lot of sense.  US GIVES the jews a country to live in in 1948.  THEN we supply them with billions of dollars worth of FREE defense equipment and weapons.  OF COURSE I can see why they would attack their only true ally.  Common Sense.
,yada yada,2006-03-04T21:48Z,"pirate 32, you're either a totally ignorant idiot or uninformed. have a look at the film 'dead in the water', also found here at the pirate bay. it's a bbc documentary that should help you make use of your brain, if you actually have one, that is.

everybody, plz stfu and don't post any unnecessary, stupid comments before you have all the facts presented to you! if you're not enough well informed, your only right is to shut up and remain silent until you have done your homework."

,mcmanuf,2007-04-22T14:14Z,"tomtomx how the hell can you be so ignorant. Every wrongdoing done by israel, you have an exuse for. 

Well tell me this in the libanon-israel war 2006, when 4 UN soldiers were killed by the israeli airplanes. UN said that.
Have you got any exuse for that action? Did the UN troppers like like Hizbollah! 
Comon use your brains a bit. 
What about all the assaults on innocent palestinens. I thing you  know of some of the crimes israel has done.  "
,mcmanuf,2007-04-22T14:15Z,"like like = look like

did you have an exuse for the assaults on innocent palestinens??"
,tomtomx,2007-05-01T12:48Z,"mcmanuf: No I don't have an excuse for every wrongdoing done by Israel. Just the ones that aren't true. The pro-arab and anti-israel propaganda machine produces dozens every day.

As for the UN-thing. According to Maj.-Gen. Lewis MacKenzie, hezbollah used the neighbour house to launch attacks, using the UN post as a shield. (Do you have an excuse for that?)"
,tomtomx,2007-05-01T12:48Z,"The dead observer, Maj. Paeta Hess-von Kruedener, wrote an e-mail last week to the Canadian television network CTV that alluded to Hezbollah's tactics.

""What I can tell you is this, we have on a daily basis had numerous occasions where our position has come under direct or indirect fire from both (Israeli) artillery and aerial bombing.
""The closest artillery has landed within 2 meters (sic) of our position and the closest 1000 lb aerial bomb has landed 100 meters (sic) from our patrol base. This has not been deliberate targeting, but rather due to tactical necessity.""

MacKenzie said Hess-von Kruedener was indicating Israeli strikes were aimed at Hezbollah targets near the post, the Canadian news service reported.

""What that means is, in plain English, 'We've got Hezbollah fighters running around in our positions, taking our positions here and then using us for shields and then engaging the (Israeli Defence Forces),"" he said.

McKenzie said this indicates Hezbollah purposely set itself up near the U.N. post, a tactic he observed in previous international missions. McKenzie was the first U.N. commander in Sarajevo during the Bosnia civil war, CanWest reported.

The U.N. has claimed there was no Hezbollah activity in the area of the strike.

From his U.N. post, however, Hess-von Kruedener wrote he had a view of the ""Hezbollah static positions in and around our patrol Base."""
