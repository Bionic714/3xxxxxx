,jakesnake001,2006-01-14T01:47Z,"I dled this, and yes, the compression is screwed up.  I used winrar."
,Hyrpwrd,2006-02-18T00:52Z,"Jaden10,
Thank you SOOOO MUCH for this fix! It WORKS. I had no problem with the download or decompression. I used WinZip--afterall, it IS a WinZip file. I had a 60-day trial copy of Windows Server 2003 R2. Now I have no activation icon in the Notification area and no activation statement in the System Summary. Thanks."
,uull,2006-04-07T19:20Z,Thank's GREATH!!!
,Kiddo_Nq,2006-04-21T09:43Z,dont know have tried both winrar and zip neither worked ?
,AnGrY_BaStArD,2006-05-20T22:46Z,"its a fake,
why don't you switch off your pc and do something less boring instead - wanker!"
,The_Navigator,2006-05-27T17:52Z,"You have to use WinZip 10 or later to unzip file.

Have yet to use it, will tryout on VM first."
,m3tal,2006-08-20T13:53Z,my F-secure says it no virus.. but my friends norton says it is... ^^ .. the file doesnt work anyway..
,belnerd,2006-09-30T18:05Z,"This worked for my Windows XP Professional x64. I tried the activation after this crack and it said that Windows was already activated.

Didn't open with 7zip, used Winzip 10 to extract the files."

,aljinn99,2007-08-01T02:52Z,"Did not work for me, every time i use it, my computer restarts"
,ilovpiratebay,2008-03-21T10:58Z,"It works. First you have to rename it to:
antiactivation.zip then use winzip10 to unzip and then you follow the instructions given. Thats it!"
,kokoloupo,2008-08-11T06:47Z,"It is a good fix, but the zip file obviously it was made using Winzip's maximum compresion mode which uses the ""PPMd"" algorithm that is not a widely or default standard for zip files.

That is a good ocassion to say again that please when you share data use the most widely, freely available and supported standards and avoid those very restricted, privative, stravagant or peculiar.

In this case taking into account the very small size of the archive (even when uncompressed) there was no point in using maximum compresion algorithm instead of normal."
