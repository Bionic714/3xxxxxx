I actually found this in a Windows Server 2003 R2 torrent.
It contains the Windows Product Activation fix for Windows XP Home, Pro (all service packs), Windows Server 2003 (all versions) Windows Server 2003 R2 (all versions). Windows XP x64 (all versions) Windows XP for Itanium and Itanium 2 and Windows Vista (all versions)x86 and x64.

This is the real deal people.
