,xDieHardx,2009-07-13T04:21Z,"After I downloaded UFC Tapout from your torrent, I went to play it after FTPing it to my Xbox and after the initial launch period, it just stayed on a black screen, I tried changing the region still has just a black screen... I used MagicISO to extract the ISO, any tips because I plan on downloading a few of these torrents but I don't want to waste my time if they are all going to give a black screen.
