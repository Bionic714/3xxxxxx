DVB recording converted to DVD - no recompression, so pure broadcast quality
Episode 14? - The Christmas Invasion
Also includes..
The episode of confidential from the DVD box set
Audio commentary from the BBC website - v. nice of them wasn't it?
The preview clip from children in need which was not included in the episode.
A nice menu, rather than the template ones I have made for previous releases

I will do the interactive game thing as a later release, because I will need to re-encode some of the video to make it multi-angle compliant (closed GOPS don't you know)

Til then, enjoy, and Merry Christmas!
