ZoneAlarm Internet Security Suite is the easy-to-use, comprehensive security solution that is based on the world's best firewall to keep out hackers, viruses, worms, and other threats. It combines the most popular firewall with antivirus, Web site filtering, privacy protection, instant messaging security and more to provide the best overall protection of any PC security suite.

ZoneAlarm┬« Internet Security Suite - Complete Internet Protection:
* NEW Triple Defense Firewall?

Along with its effective and easy-to-use firewall protection, ZoneAlarm Security Suite adds privacy, security, and virus-protection features. ZoneAlarm's wizard makes configuring a firewall incredibly easy. The app's stylish interface and simple slider controls make maintaining and updating settings a snap. Experts will appreciate options that let them set up custom rules. The program's Zones feature also allows you to assign different security levels for local networks and the Internet. We found ZoneAlarm Security Suite to be very good at recognizing and automatically including settings for our local network. In all our tests, the firewall guarded against all external and internal threats it encountered. Beyond the firewall function, ZoneAlarm Security Suite includes an antivirus scanner based on Computer Associates' Vet Anti-Virus. The cookie cleaner and ad blocker were effective, but the pop-up stopper failed a number of tests. The privacy-protection features let you apply settings individually to different Web sites. The ID Lock feature stores personal information, such as social security and credit card numbers. Security Suite is the only version of ZoneAlarm to incorporate a basic filter that blocks sites according to various types of content; you can configure it to block various types of naughtiness or just one category, such as racist material. Security Suite also incorporates the company's IMSecurity program, which protects instant-messenging programs from spam and encrypts messages (so long as the person on the other end also is using IMSecurity). Users looking for one solution to just about all their Internet security concerns can turn to ZoneAlarm Security Suite.
