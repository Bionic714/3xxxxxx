Heh, theres your problem.

,boss_girl,2006-05-29T22:39Z,so tell me tspse which antivirus do u prefer?
,norplay,2006-07-23T08:30Z,I'm testing Zone Alarm and so far I experience the firewall it's much more better than Sygate firewall! I don't care if the antivirus is bad. It's more important to stop attacks from internet to protect my network/computer from worms and spyware!!! Use f-prot antivirus.
