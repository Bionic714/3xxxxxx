This is the second version of Celine Dion's hit All by myself.

First version included footage from 'falling into you' concert and Celine Dion.

This version does include Celine Dion but not the concert. Instead a mini plot is build up. It's about a man and a woman which lives happily together. On a party he sees her kissing another man and afterwards at home he wants her to leave.

In the end she apologies for her acting and they live happily together. All is taking part around christmas!

I like this version a bit more than the first due to the mini plot.

Now the first version was the single version (album edit). This is the album original version (a bit fade in the end about 30 seconds).

It's 4:33 in MPEG-1 2500 kbps and audio in 225 kbps. Originally recorded from VH! onto DVD (In sp quality) an now transfered to PC.

Hope you all like this!
