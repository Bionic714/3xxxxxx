,sdaejo,2006-12-19T02:22Z,"Stuck at 84.1% for a day now.  I see there are 10 other peers, all stuck at 84.1% as well.  Shame......."
,sdaejo,2007-03-31T21:38Z,"My last comment was over 3 months ago, and I'm still stuck at 84.1%, and so are at least 12 other peers I see.  Looks like the seeder stopped at 84.1% and never came back.  DON'T DOWNLOAD THIS!

In any case, after nerly 4 months trying to DL this, I'm off the peer pool."
