Small program i made

Folder Maker makes 27 folders labeled (A - Z) and a (0 - 9) folder, 
its handy if you sort all your albums, games, programs ect by first letter,
(example: all artists starting with a in A folder, all artists starting with b in B folder) it saves you the time of having to make 27 seprate folders,
all you have to do now is select the place to make the folders and click Make Folders.
