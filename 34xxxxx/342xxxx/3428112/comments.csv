First question - do you have a hookup to the seed ?"
,gfjgfhuWE,2006-01-05T21:36Z,"Umm... i uploaded this torrent at http://asiandvdclub.org/ (a private tracker). I don't appreciate the fact that you are posting it here. There are 6seeders at http://asiandvdclub.org/ so go there and DL it.
Thank You"
,Timonaz,2006-01-05T21:43Z,"""I don't appreciate the fact that you are posting it here""  HAHA that's biggest bullshit i have heard :D"
,gfjgfhuWE,2006-01-05T21:56Z,How is that Bullshit? I DON'T like the fact he posted it here.
,Timonaz,2006-01-05T22:20Z,why the hell did you release these if you don't wan't people to get these? that's same thing if every scene groups would come here to whine about their releases beeing shared
,hfw,2006-01-05T23:47Z,"mmmmmm... been treading on some toes apparently. The fact that one puts up a torrent on a private tracker and in 20 minutes manages to sweep the whole web for any possible ""duplicators"" says a lot. Are you staying on the web permanently to police your torrent, do you have spyware out there for the purpose, is it secret somehow... and is it even yours after Â˝ year (yes it has been out there for quiet a while)... and why are you a member here, are some movies to esoteric to share with us ?
I got hang of it it through the DHT-tracker - thrown out by the asiandvdclub, but taken in by the DJT, a non privatized tracker - and in a while that will be the principle way of torrent-dl... something to do with e-volution I guess... and a part of e-volution is the ""giver attitude"". I regret you dont appreciate my torrent, but hey - I'm marketing your private tracker ;-) By the way gfjgfhuWE, thank you for the upload."
,gfjgfhuWE,2006-01-06T02:03Z,evolution is to use DHT??? are you kidding every private tracker out there has begun to ban the use of clients that have DHT that can't be turned off.
,hfw,2006-01-06T11:44Z,"No, I'm not kidding... as you say - the PRIVATE trackers BANN it. This is a OPEN tracker with a sharing attitude and a very broad spectrum of people and it does NOT bann it. Don't you get it - you can't forbidd something everybody does. This subject is exhausted - at TPB you share, make your contribution... if you prefer privacy, banning, strict rules on fileformatting, ratio-faschism, a place where there are a few ""gods""... stick to that tracker."
,Tourniquest,2006-01-06T12:18Z,Can piracy be copyrighted?
,gfjgfhuWE,2006-01-06T14:27Z,"Open tracker with a ""Sharing"" attitude? ha ha ha... i'm sure if they released some stats we would see that only 2% of the ppl that use this site have a respectable ratio.  Private trackers enforce sharing... and only leachers complain about that."
,Tourniquest,2006-01-08T23:01Z,@gfjgfhuWE - And still the torrents work... Go figure!

AsianDVDclub is currently OFFLINE atm, and has banned about 30% of their overall users...not something i personally want to be a part of. LONG LIVE FREE UNRESTRICTED DOWNLOADS!!  (PS: i can't think of *one* single time thePirateBay was offline....)"
