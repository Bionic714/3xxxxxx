,kkevinn6,2006-01-05T18:39Z,"never heard of this movie but it looks good, thanks"
[T],sickboy88,2006-01-05T23:36Z,"Thanks.  Links to the box, which is much different than the rest of the world.  It's funny, that this is only rated to be 15 years old or older in australia. lol

,philip_j_fry,2006-01-06T02:26Z,"H.264 looks great, but my set-top DVD player (Philips DVP642) can't play it, and that's what I generally use to watch movies, not my computer.  I also like to pass along copies to friends, and they won't bother with H.264.  A lot more people will see your stuff if you stick to your normal encoding routine.  Please keep making the excellent XviD (or DivX) versions.  Thanks."
,kkevinn6,2006-01-06T03:02Z,how much did you buy the dvd for?
[T],sickboy88,2006-01-07T01:57Z,"I bought a shitload of dvd's from australia in 2000, when the usa dollar was 2:1.  International orders do not pay "" Australia's obscene Goods and Services Tax""which is 9%.

I bought them here:

Even now, with shipping, I can get new dvd's at 20-60% less in a week from australia, then I can in the USA.  It's worth checking out.  Of course everything is region 4 pal, so make sure you can watch those."
[T],sickboy88,2006-01-07T03:10Z,"So far, my tests with h.264 in opendml AVI's, encoded with vfw compat mode play PERFECTLY on my phillips dvp-642.  I have a few more tests, if it keeps working, I'll encode everything avi/h264 from now on."
,kkevinn6,2006-01-07T03:54Z,"i see, thanks"
,ptalindstrom,2006-01-17T22:04Z,"well it was working with my inital setup.. but then decided i'd clip off the disgusting sickboy into scene with VDub... didn't like my matroska install... 

ended up removing ffdshow, other codecs, matroksa and re-installing latest of ffdshow and matroska... now i only get sound...

oh well.. looked like a good movie... too bad not xvid or divx or something normal."
[T],sickboy88,2006-09-12T08:06Z,"I made a pack for everyone to get that contains EVERYTHING needed in order to watch my .mkv/x264 shit, as well as instructions on how to install the programs, and what options to use.
