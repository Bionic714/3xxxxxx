A nice Australian film that many people have not even heard of.  It's a bit like a "Guy Ritchie" movie.

This was ripped from the 103 minute REGION 4 DVD that I bought directly from Australia.  For some reason, various copies of this movie are showing up for sale, with 10-20 minutes of shit missing, such as this 90 minute version sold at amazon.com:
