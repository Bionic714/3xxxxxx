The Real (Scene) Auditor v1.224

Introduction:

Real Auditor is a checklist program, it's similar to a renamer, but instead of renaming the ROMs it just checks to see which you have so you can see what is needed. This created this for those of you that prefer the scene release names, this way you can leave them the way they should be, with all the extra files intact.
