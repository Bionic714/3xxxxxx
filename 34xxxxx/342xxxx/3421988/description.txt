One tool, to support all formats, for only one very democratic price.

IsoBuster is a highly specialized yet easy to use CD and DVD data recovery tool.  It supports all CD and DVD formats and all common CD and DVD file-systems (= set of files and folders).  Start up IsoBuster, Insert a CD or DVD, select the drive (if not selected already) and let IsoBuster mount the media.  IsoBuster immediately shows you all the tracks and sessions located on the media, combined with all file-systems that are present.  This way you get easy access, just like explorer, to all the files and folders per file-system.  Instead of being limited to one file-system that the OS picks for you, you have access to "the complete picture".  Access data from older sessions, access data that your OS (e.g. Windows) does not see or hides from you etc.

Combine this all-revealing functionality with far better read and recovery mechanisms, scanning for lost files functionality, workarounds for a wide range of drive and software bugs, limitations or shortcomings and you have an enormously powerful data recovery tool.  IsoBuster is must-have-software for every PC user and is deliberately kept low priced to be able to offer a solution for everybody, even if it is much used in the professional optical and data forensics world.
