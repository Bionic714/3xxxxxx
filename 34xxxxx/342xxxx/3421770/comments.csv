,moses22,2006-11-25T04:32Z,"This one might seem a little ""homo"" in the beginning (instructions by two half naked muscle guys), also a little non-pro, however both the workout and stretch is great. With the thorough (""kiwi"") instructions and well selected sets this is my favorite yoga tape of about 15 I have downloaded from the net. About 1 hour effective practise (ads in the front and back), great after a long day in the office or after other sports to stretch out especially good for the back."
,skymning84,2008-07-07T09:33Z,I have used this alot and it's really good. One of my favs.
,richardkgray,2009-01-23T04:19Z,"moses22, I laughed when I read the description of this - your FAVORITE yoga vid.   
I've already practised with this vid a couple of times - do ya reckon I'll turn into a ""kiwi homo"" ?   
And why am I starting to get aroused when I do the stretch where you ""lean forward and let your buttocks relax""....?"

Well check out the back flips they are doing in the credits. They are always with really hot chicks. I am pretty sure they are straight . If they are getting in that sort of shape from this type of yoga and are scoring chicks like that,  I am all over this Yoga DVD. "
,sodiumdreamz,2009-09-29T15:02Z,This is a great video.  The poses are challenging but not too difficult or boring.  A little bit of everything.
,gnawingonfoot,2011-03-14T03:45Z,"This is an excellent vid, especially considering that it's free.  It starts off a little cheeseball (as does pretty much every yoga video), but it quickly picks up into content.  Two guys give you both the side and front views of the poses as you go through them, and the narration explains what all you should be doing during the routine.  The only drawback to this video is the wmv format--I'd love to see this in an open format, as wmv files get a little funky at times.  

Highly recommended for anyone looking for a good, free introductory yoga video tuitorial and routine!"
