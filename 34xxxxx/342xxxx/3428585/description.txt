Patching the image:                                              
1 Unpack the CD1 image and the mir-pjkkpt.rar in the rar you will
find the tool.                                                    
2 Open the tool make sure you put it in the same directory as the 
image or just click browse to look for it.                                         
3 Look what mediatype you like to use and select it from the      
dropdownbox.                                                     
4 Now click patchme and it will state patching in progress please 
wait!!                                                            
5 Due to a small bug it will not tell you when the image is done  
just check the directory                                         
(it uses the same directory as the old one but is                 
called PATCHED). and install
use this serial 3mgcl-pjt4m-ah9gt-xjcrw-jqtny, use the daemon tools to play the game. the image you will run on it is the one you have patched before.
