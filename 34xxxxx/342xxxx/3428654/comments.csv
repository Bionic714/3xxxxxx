Comming soon are the generators for: Alpine, Beaker, BMW, Fiat, Honda, Hyunai, Iveco, Jaguar, Kia, Lancia, Lexus, Nissan, Peugeot, Porsche, Seat, Skoda, Subaru, Suzuki, toyota, Volkswagen, Vauxhall/opel, Volvo, Yugo and others. Im trying to get the Gm, Pontiac, and Saturn software but that is going to set me back about 300 bucks. On about 1/9/06 I should have all the above."

Thanks in advance and GREAT upload."
[T],user507,2006-01-10T10:35Z,"The place I bought the software from stated that it was for Porsch, VW and all the other ones I mentioned. When the new software was sent to me, it was the same as the ones I allready posted. I asked them and they told me that Blaupunkt radios are installed in Porsches and VW's. I got a few extra ones that were not included with the ones I posted this time but all of the one you got from me should cover most of all of them. I will post the other soon."
