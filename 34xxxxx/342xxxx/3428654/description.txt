As you know a lot of the new car radios have an Anti-Theft feature that will render your OEM radio useless if your battery is removed or if you remove the radio from your car. In order to re-activate the radio you must call your local dealer and give them your radios serial number that is printed on it. They will charge you 10 to 50 bucks to give you the code. This software will generate the code for you so you do not have to pay for it. I will upload more code generators for more cars soon. This software will cover: Becker, Clarion, Daewoo, Grundig, Mercedes Alpine 10, Volvo, Blaupunkt, clarion_barcode_code_calc, Ford, Hyundai, and Various.
