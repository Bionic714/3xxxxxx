This collection was transferred from 21 vinyl albums to cd using groove mechanic. I also meticulously recorded all session information for each cd. This music is out-of-print (at least in the form of one collection) and hard to find (ESPECIALLY as mp3s) so PLEASE, PLEASE keep seeding. This is a re-seed on my part. I will also be re-seeding the Complete Commodore Jazz Recordings (also transferred from vinyl, also out-of-print) and other hard to find music that I originally seeded over the summer. Again, PLEASE keep SEEDING. Enjoy!
