,FarfarGreger,2006-01-09T22:02Z,"det funkar inte när jag ska spela.... när jag har sattigång cracket så står det:
Emulator detected!
Please deactivate virtual drive and emulation software. 
vad ska jag göra?"
,johnnyrico,2006-01-26T00:18Z,Plays fine on my Dual 2.5G5 with 128Mb graphic card. If you download the crack file it allows you to play it on any Mac without checking if it meets requirements and without having the DVD in. Game isn't that great though in my opinion
,spawn1987,2006-04-02T19:45Z,i have radeon 9600

,McBanjo,2008-05-07T16:26Z,"I can't get this crack to work in Leopard. I'm using a 15"" Penryn MBP w/ nVIDIA 8600M? The app just closes. Has anyone got this to work on a recent Mac? If so please post. Maybe we need a new crack."
,Guble,2009-02-13T16:37Z,"this game downloaded nice and fast, but every time i try to run it, it just quits unexpectedly"
,kiddojono,2009-08-23T10:02Z,"Guble, try updating it. often games don't work straight off the download properly. download an update and it should work fine. Although some games with no cd cracks lose the crack when updated. use Toast for that problem."
,Rezinunts,2009-10-30T01:59Z,"I installed, updated, and then cracked....Nothing happens....Double-click the icon and....nothing at all...I have OSX 10.5.6 Leopard, 2.2 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo, 2 GB 800 MHz RAM, NVIDIA GeForce 7300 w\ 256 MB of VRAM....Anyone think they can help me out here....I am a big zombie fan and want to play this game horribly bad."
