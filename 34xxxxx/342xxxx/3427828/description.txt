Bill O'Reilly came on Dave Letterman's Late Show for some nice and pleasant conversation. But Dave wasn't having any of that. First he ridiculed Bill's Christmas Crusade, then he told Bill that he thinks 60% of what he's saying is crap. To finish off with a broad smile and: "Bill, always a pleasure!"
