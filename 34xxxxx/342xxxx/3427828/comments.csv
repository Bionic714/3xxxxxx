Hardly a crushing.
If Letterman what to debate he should aquire some facts. He chastises O'Reilly for the ""fair and balanced"" catch phrase that Fox uses and then has to admit to O'Reilly that he dosn't watch!! Says he 'reads' about it, ie he get his information second hand. Eh, isn't this a bit like the CIA!"

I am sorry to disagree with you O'Reilly owned that segment.
Don't let your love for a celebrity cloud your judgment.
He was too passionate and got too upset when O?Reilly pushed him up against a political wall.
Letterman should stay out of the political arena and let the big boys play, he doesn?t know enough about the subjects and embarrasses himself.
Now if you want to see some good debating watch Bill O?Reilly vs. James Carville, now that's a man that can go toe to toe with the Factor Man."
,splintereye,2006-01-10T19:54Z,well i cant agree with that letterman crushes o'reilly but o'reilly hardly crushed letterman either. and letterman says himself that his not smart enough to debate with him on all points.
,ollemule,2006-07-26T00:44Z,"Just watch ""Outfoxed"""
,ollemule,2006-07-26T00:46Z,"...and yes, I agree that Letterman is the winner here. But thatÂ´s just a matter of opinion, innit?"
