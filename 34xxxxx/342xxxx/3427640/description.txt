Downloaded from Ilfak Guilfanov's homepage.
MD5 checksums are included.
The reason why the link to the homepage is an ip-number instead of a www-adress is because he has moved servers and the new homepage will not be available for 1-2 days from now.

Install this patch and once the official MicroSoft patch comes out, you can uninstall this one.

Hope this helps a few people from getting exploited and having to bare with SpyAxe and all that malware/spyware/adware.
