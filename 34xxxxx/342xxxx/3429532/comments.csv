,kclubb,2006-01-10T03:50Z,"Dude, first off, learn how TCP/IP works. There's a thing called compression though TCP/IP.  All that compressing will do is make the transfers go slower though the net (even though it's really going at the same rate) because it can't compress the data stream.  Want to test this?  get a 2 mb word document and download it remotely via dial up (yup, it makes the difference more noticable).  and then download the rar/zip/ace or wtc you want to use.  the word document will download quite a bit faster than the zip file because compression is making the file conmpressed.  So really, youare getting the same speed.

The only thing compression does is save physical room on your hard drive, and buches bunches of files into 1 (aka programs that aren't shrink wrapped)

,kclubb,2006-01-10T03:55Z,"Oh, almost forgot, my 1 mb upload bandwidthis uploading at 150KBpson torrents alone consistantly...  use math 1 mb upstream is 128KBps max...  need I say more newb..."
,kclubb,2006-01-11T06:49Z,"LOL @ Freakazoidski...

If you really think you're really so smart, then you'd understand what I stated when the upload issue...  I'm not trying to brag about my connection, just using it as an example of TCP/IP compression.  Feel free to google it...  You're starting to bore me...  You're attempts at annoying me are just humoring me...  So, how many KB is 3 mb?  Well, anyhow, um ya, feel free to comment when you got new material that is related to my actual torrent...

Newb"
,kclubb,2006-01-11T18:22Z,"If if you don't know what TCP/IP compression is then you truly are a newb...  As stated before, it was an example of how my uploading was greater than my allowed 1mb upload cap was due to ""compression""...   PWNed"
,kclubb,2006-01-11T18:32Z,"Since you were to lazy to google it, I did.  Here is a link.  http://www.cisco.com/en/US/tech/tk713/tk802/technologies_q_and_a_item09186a008019be75.shtml  and cry me a river...  NEWB"

,blaze7,2006-01-16T13:41Z,so what's the f'inkg movie like? Good story or what?

,todak,2006-01-30T15:59Z,"nice torrent, i was lookin' around for this, 2 thumbs up! ^^

freakazoidski get a life dude, there's evidently people who still want this movie, and you're just making an ass outta yourself. you tried to argue and then you got hammered. please do the world a favour and STFU."
,annerkull,2006-02-14T16:44Z,"How do I play this movie? WMP register some kind of codec error and I've tried a variety of other media players. I get sound but no picture.

Ohh yes, feel free to flame me for being a noob or anything. Just aslong as I can get a answer :)"
,merlin_the_end,2006-02-22T10:31Z,"Thanks kclubb! It's true that there are other torrents of this file, but it's also true that yours is the best. You deserve much thanks! (I mean, what's up with bashing one of the few people who'll actually upload and then (omg) seed something?)"
,kope007,2006-02-24T01:35Z,"Thanks I've been looking for a healthy one for a while.

,WookieD,2006-02-28T01:07Z,"Annerkull - I've had this problem with Codec 55 and didn't resolve it in WMP. In the end I downloaded VLC Player and it works fine (runs off it's own codec cache) Check this thread:

,kclubb,2007-03-27T12:29Z,"guys, guys, if you are not getting audio / video, please get the needed codecs (mainly xvid) to view the file.  I'm sorry I haven't been seeding the torrents lately, I've been running my own tracker outside of the comment bs that goes on via torrents like this that I hosted pub and well, suffice to say...  some of you peeps don't deserve my bandwidth to be dedicated to the torrent, sorry to those who have been...
