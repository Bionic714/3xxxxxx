Hello,


I made an archive of all aviable repaints of the Level-D 767-300.
This are the regular repaints (longer load times - Uses more system resources)
This archive was made one Jan 5th 2006 so all repaints aviable at that time are included.

A description how to install the repaints is enclsed in the archive.

The archive contains the following repaints:


Aeromexico (7.72 MB)
Air Canada (4.64 MB)
Air Canada NC (5.25 MB)
Air China (7.39 MB)
Air Do (6.63 MB)

There are also DXT3 repaints (faster loading - Uses less system resources) than there aer more liveries aviable.
Maybe I'll make an archive of this too.
