,Blodhosta,2006-01-09T23:51Z,"I just love this game! Sure, it has its flaws, but I just worship every sneaky stelth game like this so much that I'm left without aim in life when I finish them... And this one's no exception. :'("
,Latrodectus81,2006-01-12T18:09Z,"Why is it when I compare the .lyt with the actual game files, it says that there are two missing files and 125 that are in the game file but aren't even on the list?
Also, I have had no luck burning this game, so far. It merely comes up with a Dirty Disk Error."
,highrollerut,2006-01-14T19:35Z,Please avoid using this game from your hard drive it has corrupt files on it I had to wipe out my hard drive twice and found that when I FTP this game it corrupts everything (Avoid this unless you want to go through what I did)
,Moleblitz,2006-04-05T14:30Z,"So is this gonna mess my hard drive up or not?? Have had no luck with burning any games to DVD's!

If anyone could help me with that my email is moleblitz@hotmail.com

Cheers ;)"

,wakanabi,2010-06-25T16:15Z,"It WOULD be able to be played on 360, IF it was freakin NTSC-U Instead of PAL.  Asshole needs to label his games right"
