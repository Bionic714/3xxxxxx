Sniper Elite (Xbox) 


Sniper Elite takes place in war-torn Berlin during the final days of World War II. As the Soviets and Germans are locked in a life and death struggle, the western Allies fear the looming Cold War. Assuming the role of a lone American sniper trained by the OSS, a player must infiltrate hostile enemy environments using their stealth and sniping skills and keep the Soviets from shifting the balance of power. The player's mission will span 28 sensitive and challenging missions. When sniping, a player must use gravity, elevation, wind speed and direction, heart rate, breath, posture, background noise and other conditions to successfully hit their mark. When a mission is accomplished, a player can engage in 2-player co-op, 8-player deathmatch or multiplayer network play.
