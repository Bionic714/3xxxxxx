,stonewise,2007-02-24T18:47Z,"Sierra Home Architect is the most user friendly app i've ever used, Punch Home Design however, has many extensive features... My favorite tool for Punch Software is Real Model... 
in which you printout the pieces and construct your model...

,captainsae,2009-01-26T07:26Z,"**WARNING**
Installing this program will install a virus/worm. I have used Avast and Malwarebyte to remove this crap (5 instances of trojans/worms/viruses) but the 3d architect has limited functionality afterwards. For instance you cant resize furniture etc. I have to assume that most of these comments are fake. Why do these hackers do this? What's the point?"
,BlackholeForever,2009-04-30T21:09Z,"FYI: I downloaded two versions of 3D Home Architect v6. Results:

(URL unknown, but TPB is a tracker)

Once extracted, torrents are file-for-file and byte-for-byte IDENTICAL.

The Setup.exe executable is essentially one large InstallShield/.MSI package.  I found no evidence of viral/malware content.

Hope this helps..."
