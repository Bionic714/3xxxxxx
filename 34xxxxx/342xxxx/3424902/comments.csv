Every time I try to mount the zero hours dick 1, it just says install, so I do, then it asks me to either repair or remove. I tried repair, but then it asks me to insert Generals disk 1. After I do that it 'repairs it' but then it's back to square one. I can play generals now, but not zero hour.

,Traxx2333,2008-02-17T22:56Z,"OMG! HAHAHA!!!! Just do as the Instructions say. 

Dameon tools..or..Poweriso.. "
,Traxx2333,2008-02-17T22:57Z,"OMG! HAHAHA!!!! Just do as the Instructions say. 

Dameon tools or Poweriso
Install either of these into your Pc. 

When it asks you how many drives you want choose 1,2,3,4,5,6,7 your choice. Go to your My Computer thats on your desktop. The drive should look like this F:\Then the name of the game.

Then mount the game to one of the drives you created using Poweriso or Dameon tools. Or burn the game to a dvd or cd disk. again your choice.
But you can still install the game from your HD drive. 

The crack should be in a folder title Crack and it should look like this F:\Crack or whatever title the torrent maker decided to put it under.

Install the game... Put the crack into the game folder you just installed C:\Program Files\Whatever game or game company... Copy and paste the crack into this folder. 

everything in this game works and its easy to install"

,PikKirby,2008-05-26T06:38Z,"I think if the game keeps asking you ""need CD"" you should get an Cracked game exe. 


Example
(Game name here).exe

Which would be cracked so you dont need a virtual CD emulator (Daemon, alcohol) 


This site is good, almost no virsus and tons of cracked exe for millions of PC games.

,hereinlakeland,2009-06-10T19:34Z,"if you have not been able to correctly install the command and conquer and expansion, hit me back and i can walk you through it. OR just install, unzip the main files should be the CAB files on CD 1 and 2 for the Generals not Zero Hour. Then run the autorun.exe. / setup.exe - forgot which one. But it will lead to the installation of the game. You must COPY or COPY TO CLIPBOARD the ""Generals"" (not Icon) inside the CRACK folder and paste (to replace) the one located inside - MY COMPUTER, C:, PROGRAM FILES, EA GAMES, COMMAND AND CONQUER. it will ask if you want to replace and just click yes/ok. Game will now be playable without the skirmishes - only campaigns.  If you wish to play the skirmishes then you must use your daemon or I use POWER ISO to - click mount button, select the drive - G,H,I,J or whatever, mount image, then highlight the first CD's usable file, then click open. DONE. Game will ask for CD if it is not mounted to a selected drive - virtual CD. ---- Generals crack is located inside the update folder - you might have to change the type of readable file in the POWER ISO to find it. I could not copy and paste this one to the one in the C: drive. I had to delete the first and then move the updated crack for Zero Hour."
,hereinlakeland,2009-06-10T19:38Z,Sorry Zero Hour crack is located inside the updated folder. You must also do the same install process for the Zero Hour Expansion as for the Generals....but you should be smart enough to figure that out on your own.
