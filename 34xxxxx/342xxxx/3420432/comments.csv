[T],clownmonkey,2006-01-02T21:04Z,"re quality: it says ""Telesync"" right there, nicht wahr?"
,Insipid,2006-01-03T00:39Z,"Not a great sign that the sample file doesn't work. Only meaningful error message I could find was from realplayer ""Bad data in avi"". Can someone confirm this is just a problem in the sample and not the movie?"
,Dalle1985,2006-01-03T13:16Z,"The movie itself works just fine, however the quality is not great..."
,oystbjoe,2006-01-03T16:54Z,and what about the quality?
,ohne89,2006-01-04T00:08Z,"Thanks yiulon. Quality is good, definately watchable. The movie however is a complete piece of shit. Not because of the movie actually but because of the story. C. S. Lewis must be the worst storyteller that has ever seen the face of earth."

,JooiZe,2006-01-16T20:44Z,"damn.. sorry for doublepost, refreshed..."
,morseman21,2006-01-18T18:18Z,There is an annoying black scratch on the mid right side of the screen for the entire movie. I prefer to find something better. 
,Sektion8,2006-01-28T13:49Z,"To The Perfectionist Below: Dude, seriously... Yes, there's an ""annoying"" black mark throughout the movie - But if my extended family can watch it blown-up onto a 3mtr screen (PJ) without a single complaint, then I'm sure you can too. To normal people, it's all about the movie, nothing else. So easily distracted... Hmm. There's just no pleasing some people :("
,the.pirate,2006-12-02T20:42Z,If you are going to watch a movie u want to see it as best as possible so a black scratch is alot if u want it perfect.
