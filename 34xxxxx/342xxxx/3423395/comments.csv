i hate walmart haters
its not walmarts falt thay have what people want for the right price!!
not only that thay have everything you need..
what store do you like zellers or kmart the cheap shitholes that rip people off and dont have half the stuff you need so you waste a bunch for gas driving around to find what you need and that you just end up a walmart!!!!!!!!!!!!"
