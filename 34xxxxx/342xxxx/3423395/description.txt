Consider this as warm-up material for "WalMart: High Cost of a Low Price."

The recording is a 60-minute continuous audio take of the noise, din, cacophony from inside a crowded Wal-Mart around dinner time, on a busy Friday night.

Most people who hear this material all come to the same independent conclusion: WalMart must be destroyed. It seems that the sounds of Hell-Mart taken out of context have a profound effect. It is a torture tape, especially so for the one million-plus Hell-Mart employees. Comments are appreciated. How does this recording make YOU feel?...
