,Sektion8,2006-01-28T14:03Z,"""The zip 11.01.2005 polina - brama is bad""... Isn't that why everyone uses real compression programs like WinRAR which have Recovery of some sort..."
,saisumimen,2006-02-07T15:19Z,"true, but stupid faggot noobs use the ""zip feature"" that's built into windoze cuz, well.... they're a bunch of stupid faggot noobs ;p"
,ElCuco,2008-06-11T07:03Z,"Wow, is that your way of thanking the Uploader? Now THAT is a stupid way to leech (insulting the seeder)... No wonder he didn't finish uploading the November ones, let alone, start 2006... 

Thanks for your time seeding, rogerx."
,capnpat,2008-08-22T18:19Z,"I agree ElCuco...stupid comments like this (or sometimes just as bad, no comments) is the STUPIDEST way to leech.  I enjoy the MetArt ULs quite a bit and am happy to see them...let's all remember we're getting sh!t for free here, shall we?  ....and he did offer to provide a fix in a later torrent after all.  Get a life saisumimen.
Thanks rogerx for the up.  Good work!"
