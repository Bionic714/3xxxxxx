This documentary tells the story of how the United Nations, from 1960 to 1962, waged an unprovoked war against the anti-Communist state of Katanga and forced it under the control of the Communist-puppet state of the Central Congo (now called Zaire). In later years, top UN personnel boasted in their public speeches and books how they pretended to be merely preserving law and order, while actually carrying out a military operation to crush the tiny nation - all in the name of peace. The great irony in this was that the free world was told - and the American people firmly believed - that the UN army had been sent to the Congo to "protect it from Communism." The reason this story needs to be told after all these years is that we have not seen the last of the UN "peace-keeping" forces. Unless Congress puts a stop to what is now called The New World Order, we are going to see UN army used more and more to bring its peculiar brand of peace to the world. And the best way to envision that future is to know the past.
