,spamfreedave,2007-12-09T23:33Z,"THANK YOU to whomever finally started seeding the full torrent!

NOTE:  These files are going to need some cleanup.

Several duped files throughout (slightly different artist names for same track)

Vol 5 is pretty hosed: Bad Track Numbers all around, and some incorrect tracks.  Keep the ""unknowns"" as some are needed.  Use amazon.com to get track numbers and sample for correct titles.

I have gotten 1-5 to verify via freedb, now to work on v6"
,spamfreedave,2007-12-09T23:49Z,"Okay, re Vol 6:

Many of the tracks are encoded with Xing at 128kbs and have that nasty Xing sound glitch.

Track 2, ""Ursa Major"" seems a bit hosed.  It shows as 32kbs encoding and 22:12 long - This is what Tag&Rename shows and also what WinAmp shows.  Winamp does stop playing the file at 3:51 which is the correct length of the file, according to the Barns & Noble website.

I think it is the incorrect length of track2 that is preventing the CD from verifying on FreeDB"
