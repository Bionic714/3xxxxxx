,akip5e,2006-01-11T02:04Z,"Instead of complaining, why don't you release your own stuff, or have some of your English speakers release some.

Don't complain when you're pirating movies and its not in English, instead, release them yourself."
,Threedots_dead,2006-01-13T19:49Z,"Have your dubbed movies, I don´t care. The only thing I´m asking, os why the fuck this movie can be found in every language EXCEPT english... Now, if that isn´t strange I dont know what is... 
And how can I release a movie that hasn´t premiered in my country yet?"

* Germany     29 December 2005	
* USA              20 January 2006

It's not hard to figure out why the English version is becoming available after the German and Spanish."
