,nomensnescio,2006-01-04T07:20Z,X'cus me for asking (i just don't know) - how do I unpack one large file which has been chopped up into several smaller .rar's ?
,StoneMonk,2006-01-07T16:00Z,"highlight all the rars/archive files, right click, 'Extract files' make sure you get them all and you dont get the other files that would make you unable to 'Extract' dont do 'extract here' it will unpack each one and overwrite"
