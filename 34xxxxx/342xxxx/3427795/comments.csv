,The_ZIT,2007-04-12T22:17Z,"English, French, Japanese: Do you mean that it was WRITTEN for English, French, Japanese, or that this specific file for download has all three? I thought it HAD all three. If so, is there any way to change to Japanese? I have to start the mkv file and it is in English. I know I am probly mistaken, but what the heck. Muise as well ask."
,ronny246,2007-07-01T18:59Z,"YEEEES!!! 
Spend all night downloading Princess Mononoke, but it was in English, without any options of changing the language. Great disappointment, hope this is the right one though. This is a fantastic piece of art!"
,DevilCandy,2007-07-31T16:02Z,"When I try to open it, only the intro is played and then I get some sort of error. I have installed the codec."
,Kranden,2007-08-05T07:29Z,I think this is a fake torrent. What a waste of download time. All you get is some goddamn fucking kid laughing at you as the ad for the company plays. Somehow they fit a junk file into 1.48gb DON'T DOWNLOAD THIS
,darkangel74,2007-08-23T13:23Z,just the intro works...I coud kill you now...
,YabberDabberDoop,2007-10-18T10:48Z,"Yup. Only the intro works with the codec installed and using the VLC player, as suggested. You guys suck ass. What a waste of time. "
,vaffelmann,2008-09-16T15:56Z,"Film is O.K. Works fine.
Just use VLC."
,LezDawson,2008-12-07T11:07Z,Please seed - this looks like the best copy on pirate bay (despite a couple of comments from people that couldn't figure it out!)!!!!  Thanks for seeding! :)
,yael_choleva,2009-01-27T18:31Z,"About downloading this file: it's excellent.
Do what is written in the description.

I was skeptical about it's authenticity, but after downloading VLC and the xvid codec it worked like a charmed.

Oh! You need to wait a few seconds after the ""laughing kid"" intro.

And of course remember to choose the correct language for the audio."
,camj,2009-08-30T13:58Z,"subs are messy, visually and the subs are for english version not japanese"
,kuijsters,2010-03-02T19:17Z,"Subs are ""deaf-subs"" and are to much centered so better to get some 'new' ones.

Video is 640x336 2500kbps"
