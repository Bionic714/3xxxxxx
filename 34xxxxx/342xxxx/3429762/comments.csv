,stoksie,2011-04-03T10:56Z,"I got invalid lisence, :/ what can I do? D:"
,wierd-old-guy,2011-04-04T19:46Z,"You got an ""invalid License"" becasue you most likely didn't firewall the program and/or attempted or allowed it to look for updates (call home). NEVER install a program when connected to the internet if using a common SN# or a keygen that find a matched algorithm code for the SN#. 
If a keygen is flagged as a virus: look at it through a virtual machine/hex editor and determine what it does before you claim it's malware! It's almost laughable for someone using lame Norton Heuristic scanning to claim something's a virus with out proof."
