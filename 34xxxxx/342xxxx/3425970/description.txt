The Puyo-Hat wearer known as Amitie from the first Puyo Fever is joined by Raffine and Sig in Segas latest Puyo Puyo game which kicks the Fever Meter up another notch. Players take a trip to the village of Purinpu where they interact with denizens and engage in Puyo Puyo color matching action. The skeletal Oshareborns from the first Puyo Fever is now a shopkeep who runs the Osharena Omise which peddles up to 72 possible power-up items in exchange for points. The town of Purinpu houses 11 new characters along with 10 returnees for a total of 21 denizens to play Puyo Puyo Fever against.
