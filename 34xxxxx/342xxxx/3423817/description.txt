CD Notes: "Ascension is a transformational experience, a heavenly carriage to greater self-awareness and attunement. Open your mind and heart and you have begun the journey. The road is one easily traveled. Just remember to look for the light that is inside you, as this is from where all voyages to inner completion begin. "
