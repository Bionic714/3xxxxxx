,Skytreker,2007-11-24T19:05Z,"Pirate Bay users suck >:(
People here download stuff and then just dissapear. If someone of them who downloaded this would kindly seed for 20 min that would solve the problem for so many other wayting for days on 99,98 %. 
But Noooo... nobody 's willing to sacrifice ""so much"" time and bindwidth. 

There should be UL/DL ratio here and people expelled if they are below 1 !!!"
