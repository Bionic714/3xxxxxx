  Please seed, this sounds like a must.
Anyone got any Sapphire & Steel ?"

I've been looking for this film on and off for the last two decades!

THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH!"
,Sunebon,2008-09-01T04:17Z,"The VOB files play fine in VLC, but there are no VIDEO_TS files (to burn a dvd), or no BUP files (for that matter).

A decent download to watch on your PC, but incomplete if you want to burn a dvd (easily).

Be warned.

(I wish this upload would be fixed... I love this show and was really looking forward to burning to dvd.)
