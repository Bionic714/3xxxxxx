Another classic British sci-fi from the 70's....You know you love 'em :).

Nigel kneale (of Quatermass fame) classic this one.The IMDB link will tell all.

For those perfectionists out there this is a full untouched DVD.Unfortunately,as with nearly all these released in Britain DVDs the only spoken language is English and no subtitles of any kind.
