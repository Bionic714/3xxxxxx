Book Title: Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software.
Publisher : Addison-Wesley.
Authors   : Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson and John Vlissides .

From the Preface
This book isn't an introduction to object-oriented technology or design. 
Many books already do a good job of that...this isn't an advanced treatise either. It's a book of design patterns that describe simple and elegant solutions to specific problems in object-oriented software design....Once you understand the design patterns and have had an "Aha!" (and not just a "Huh?" experience with them, you won't ever think about 
object-oriented design in the same way. You'll have insights that can make your own designs more flexible, modular, reusable, and understandable--which is why you're interested in object-oriented technology in the first place, right?
