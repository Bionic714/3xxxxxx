,spifkitten99,2012-03-10T13:46Z,"Horrible useless quality.

It looks like it's written on an old type writer, and the illustrations are blurry.

The real book does not look like that."
,0x7a,2012-04-22T22:34Z,I don't know what sort of PDF reader spifkitten99 is using. This PDF is good quality. I use Chrome for PDF viewing.

What he said is true. I use Adobe Arcobat Pro to read the file. The images is a bit blurry, but maybe his expectation of image quality is higher. Overall, you can still see the image clearly, but you will clearly see the blurry part."
