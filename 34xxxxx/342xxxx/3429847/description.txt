Pharaos Curse Gold is a platform game mixed with cool puzzles, in fact,
  the main focus is on the puzzle elements. In this game you can use drills,
  hammers, picks and shovels to break the tiles that guard the gold. When you
  collect all the gold in a given level, the exit door unlocks and you can go
  to the next level.

  NOTE: Because the option for changing the language ingame in Pharaos Curse
        Gold does not work because of a bug, you have two choices to change
        the language between english and german:
        1. Delete the Country.ini and after game restart you will be asked
           for a new lamguage setting.
        2. Use our tool Pharaos Curse Gold v1.71 Language Changer.exe that
           is on the CD in the directory /PATCH/ and copy it into the gamedir
           of Pharaos Curse Gold and change the language.
