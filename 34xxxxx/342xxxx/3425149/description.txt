This one is a blast of guitar greats just rolling out one after another. Johnny Winter sets the pace and gets the ball rolling with a hard rocking number named "It's My Life, Baby". Screaming guitars cutting the axe are heard on almost all twelve tracks. 
Several highlights of this album include: the piercing slide guitar of Johnny Winters; the fast-paced tribute to Hound Dog Taylor by Luther Allison; the boogie-flavored vocals and guitar of Michael Hill's Blues Mob; the unlike his typical self, Hound Dog Taylor, and the exciting, dramatic, awesome king of the slide guitar, Dave Hole. Notables on this CD are Bonnie Raitt who appears with A.C. Reed, Elvin Bishop, Michael Hill's Blues Mob, Corey Harris who has a wonderful acoustic number and the late Hound Dog Taylor. Also there is two tracks from "Hound Dog Taylor: A Tribute". This CD is a must have for any new comer to blues tradition and all guitar fans.
