,Xeno2007,2006-01-14T01:52Z,"Hey Wizard, thanks for this.

Wonder if you could help me. Could you explain how to get a tracker and upload? I've got a ton of stuff to share but still haven't figured it out.

Thanks"
,infinitiX,2006-01-31T18:26Z,"is anyone else getting the error i'm getting, where the first, say, 5 seconds of the song gets repeated two/three times before playing normally?  

i'm almost afraid to say it, but we're not starting to see another kazaa disaster, are we?"
,bad_ass326,2006-03-31T08:18Z,"it won't be a kazaa thing because only people with a relatively decent knowledge of computers can use bittorrent effectively...and with people that comment, shitty stuff dies off quickly..."
,MelchiaMH,2006-08-01T05:28Z,"I didn't get the 5-second error, but the quality was a bit off."
,mr_underwear,2007-08-07T16:48Z,"great album, thanks alot for this one!
