Download the P2P client called ""X-torent"".  It works just like limewire.  Search, find and download ""Homeworld"".  Use the Serial that Mikethejones has provided on the first page of the comments.  It works perfectly for both mac and pc.  No burning required.  Good day."

,Sawta,2008-03-15T04:14Z,"I'm not endorsing illegally installing games, but if you want this to work, this is exactly the process that you'd want to follow:

1. Go to: bittorent created HM2 folder
2. Run Homeworld2.dmg and install.  (This will create folder + files in your Application folder)
3. Run Homeworld2-1.1.1-NoCD.dmg
4. Go to: Homeworld 2 folder in your Applications folder.
5. Drag your NoCD.dmg version of Homeworld2 into your Applications/Homeworld2 folder
6. YES, replace the original Homeworld 2.app

For serials, I'm sure you could find a few in the comments.  Follow this and it should work...you know, if you're into that kind of thing."

Could anyone perhaps create a torrent for just the crack? I've downloaded the game already with some info file that failed to work right.

,ragesRemorse,2008-11-04T00:43Z,"I don't know if it's because this torrent is so old but the crack does not work. I have tried the SN's listed in the comment section here along with several other credible SN's. The SN's are accepted and will initiate installation but when you try to open the crack, a notification comes up saying that the registration number is invalid. "
,LordNitro2008,2009-03-01T17:43Z,Yes it works great and has the crack in it and has the number in it to. BUT i have a question about the res in the video settings. I razed it ALL the way up to the highest one like 1600 x 1400 or what ever. But the thing is the apply button that's in the lower right corner of the screen is way to far over to the right to where i cant click it. I tried to change the res to a lower setting but the pointer cant go over that far for some reason so i can apply the new res setting. Does any one know what i mean? If so then tell me how to get the res back to 800 x 600 or anything lower. Thanks.

Homeworld crack crashes when you launch the application. Uncheck ""Disable mouse acceleration"" in the options panel to fix it. Hold ""option"" key while launching if you chose to hide panel.

,enjaze,2010-05-15T11:07Z,"pieced it together from what the smart people said. 
Download
Open the Homeworld2.dmg
Start the installation
Use either the serial numbers
#KK7FH2CLW7VSC4GN
or  #VJ85RX5NF224R99C
has to be capitals

After you have installed, open the cd crack dmg
and open whatever folder you stuck the game into 
when you installed. 

Ok, not kidding when I say this, 
drag the Homeworld2 app from the opened Crack dmg,
and place it in the folder you installed the game to.

It will say, ""there is already blahblah, do you want to replace?""
Yes you do, swear it works. 




Oh, and this is to all the whining PC users,
*$%# you! this is posted within a only mac section ok?
next time just make sure you look in the cattegory for PCs.
If you don't know how to find that, just search a random game 
while only searching PC game files, click the random game, and 
the category type link will be there to take you to tons of pages of games

Not that I have anything against PCs, just its users are the same 
as us and get all bitchy when they find out it doesn't work for them.
They just whine more because they're not used to it. "
,bormos333,2010-11-02T14:38Z,"How the ??? did u get this installing????

,clamatyjo,2010-11-27T06:32Z,"trying to help friend and found this
it may help with serial number issue but now it asks for cd.... 
SYMPTOMS:
When you try to launch the game you get a ""Serial number check failed"" message.

RESOLUTION:
This usually happens if you uninstall the game, then reinstall it.
If you get rid of the ""HW2setup.pkg"" file located in Library/receipts this should allow you to get past this message and play the game.

,rachmadin,2011-04-30T12:01Z,"This is a Mac OS X version of Homeworld. Don't bother trying to open a .dmg file on a PC, it will serve no purpose. On a Mac, you double click (duh).

I can confirm that this version works. This is what you have to do is you run into the ""serial number wrong"" problem when trying to upgrade / crack:

(1) Install the game from Homeworld2.dmg
(2) Use KK7FH2CLW7VSC4GN as serial (it might be case sensitive, so just use this as shown).
(3) If you cannot upgrade with Homeworld2-1.1.1-NoCD.dmg (the upgraded will say ""wrong serial""), this is OK, proceed to step 4.
(4) Right click and Show Package Contents of the ""Homeworld 2.app"" inside of Homeworld2-1.1.1-NoCD.dmg
(5) Find and copy ""Homeworld 2"" from inside the folder ""Contents/MacOS"" to replace the same file inside your installed version of ""Homeworld 2.app"" (you have to show package contents of your installed app as well to do this).
(6) Profit!"
