,Maximusrex,2008-11-19T02:07Z,"sonofwill: Most of the music for GiS was done by Yoko Kano. She's responsible for some of the best anime soundtracks ever. Cowboy Bebop, Macross Plus, Vision of Escaflowne- all her work. She also has a couple of studio albums. I started to watch GiS only because I loved the Cowboy Bebop music."
