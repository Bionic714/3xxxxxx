,VileCore,2008-06-15T04:31Z,"You won't be able to play online if you are all using the same key.When you try to make an online game, the server will check your key to see if is a valid one. if it is being used, you won't be able to go online. This is something that is common with most online games, like with all Blizzard games. Either get a brand new and unused CD key (from a commercial game box), play only single-player, or shut up and deal with the fact that piracy has it's drawbacks :P"

,guelph,2008-10-21T13:37Z,"moukiki: do a wikipedia or google search on Bit Torrent (aka BitTorrent) and read up on peer-to-peer file transfer. It isnt difficult or complicated really, but one should know at least what torrents are, and it would just annoy the other users if I took the space to really explain the how and what right here. A little legwork will be rewarded. I will say this: torrent downloads dont cost cash, but they aren't ""free"" in the way you may be used to downloading from other sources. . ."
,salfanar,2008-10-30T17:02Z,"ive got an imac. for those, who do not know, thats an intel mac. now, i cant get the game to work. the patch doesnt work either. it takes like forever to finish. i let my mac run over night and it wasnt done updating

,D1g1talPh33r,2009-02-13T19:26Z,@willdrumz i have the same problem 
,D1g1talPh33r,2009-02-13T19:29Z,@KindaNewb how did you get it to work? did u have to use toast and mount it to a dvd? or no dvd required?
,Shanexlegend,2009-04-15T00:59Z,"@salfanar
iMac doesnt mean Intel Mac
My iMac is a PPC"
,D1g1talPh33r,2009-05-06T02:37Z,"I have figured out how this works.
1. Install Battlefront where all the sitx parts are
2. open the nocd.toast with toast 8 or higher (idk if it matters)
3. Mount the nocd.toast
4. right click on the stormtrooper and hit show contents
5. go to mac os folder ""in the stormtrooper""
6. open the terminal file and it should work"
,Wiiaddict,2009-05-06T05:32Z,"i own the game, looking 4 a no CD 'crack' like thingy

I hate reinserting the game every time :P"
,salfanar,2009-05-26T15:44Z,"@Shanexlegend
I think by now, every iMac has an Intel Processor and when salfanar wrote that comment, be prob had one of the newer iMacs (with the alu-body) and those have an Intel Processor as a basic piece of equipment."
