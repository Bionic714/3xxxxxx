James Cameron's Dark Angel (Xbox) 
Avenge Her Past, discover Her Future in James Cameron's Dark Angel, based on TV's sci-fi adventure series. Set in the near future after an electromagnetic pulse detonated by terrorists crippled the US economy, Max, a genetically-enhanced human prototype with attitude to spare, escaped from her military creators and made a life for herself on the edgy streets of 21st-century Seattle. She becomes a reluctant hero when she teams up with idealistic, underground cyber-journalist Logan Cale, lending her unique abilities to his crusade against corruption and an oppressive establishment. Played from a zoomed-out perspective, players fight their way through 3D levels, using martial arts moves, wall jumping and plenty of throws to defeat the opposition.
