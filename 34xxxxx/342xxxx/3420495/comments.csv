,Drmgiver,2008-06-14T21:52Z,"I must say I am a little confused.  How does the term ""warez"" get associated with Linux?????"
,clearer,2008-09-28T15:33Z,"Warez has nothing to do with the operating system but has to do with the ""legality"" of the distribution of the software. If you do not have a license to distribute software, doing so, makes the distributed copies warez. Or something to that effect at least."
,Soondead,2009-06-09T16:43Z,"Software for Linux can be free/opensource and it can be proprietary and commercial, just like software for lesser operating systems.

Pirates deal with illegal copies of proprietary and commercial software, commonly referred to as warez."
