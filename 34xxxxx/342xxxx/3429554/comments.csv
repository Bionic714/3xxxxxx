,diggensagg2000,2006-01-09T20:03Z,it has a second audio track which is in german! If you are seeding @ 0 kb/s you have some wrong settings in your client! My UPnP works again :)

Always try to upload at least as much as you download. Thats the way to keep the bittorrent network alive. On picture 2 you see the ""Share rating"": having a share rating above 1.0 means you have uploaded more than you have downloaded, which is good. In this case 0.000, which is bad. But when you have 100 %, just wait and more peers might connect. If there hasn't been any new peers for a few days, you may disconnect even though your rating is bad.

If you need to shut down your computer, you have to open the torrent again and save to the exact same place for resuming."
