Los Walkers - Walking Up Con Los Walkers 1968
From Argentina, this band started out as a mod-influenced act, but by 1968 had produced this astonishing psychedelic masterpiece highly influenced by the Rolling Stones' 'Their Satanic Majesties Request' groovy quasi-psychedelic ballads, thinly veiled Beatles pastiches and summery pop with lashings of fuzztone guitar. Featuring ex-member of Los Mockers. A prime example of the so-called 'Rioplantense psychedelia'.

An Argentine mod band from the San Telmo area of Buenos Aires. Their debut album featured some originals, as well as covers of garage classics like Gloria, Tobacco Road and The Letter. They also performed the latter for the movie "A Solas Con Tu Nombre".
Their second album featured covers of many of the classics of the era:- Lady Madonna, Honey, Words, Green Tambourine and Jennifer Eccles. After this Rover left for London. His replacement was Uruguayan and former Los Mockers member Polo Pereira.
Waking Up Con Los Walkers was their classic album. It contained some of their finest moments like Where Goes Miss Lee On Saturdays? And Sonrie A Tremelon, which featured a lovely string arrangement. They followed this with a superb organ-led single Time For Love, which was notable for a catchy melody. Sadly, none of these won them the recognition they deserved and in their final months they sang and recorded in Spanish - line-up 'C'.
You can also find El Principe Gaetano Del Monte and Mujieres Perdides on Exitos A Go Go (CD). Los Walkers recorded three albums, ?Walkers?, ?Nosotros Los Walkers? and ?Walking Up?. None of the three was ever re-edited, being the last one ?Walking Up? (english vocals) (Music Hall ? 2.047) an astonishing and exquisite psychedelic trip highly influenced by the Rolling Stones ? ?Satanic Majesties?, an incredible example of psychedelia Rioplatense. All of this material will be never re-issued here, however is anxiously sought-after by lots of collectors. All these albums have been downloaded to CDR in my little studio as I?m lucky enough to have all the originals in good state. Digital copies quality resembles the Magic Mixture one, i.e. not stunning but good enough. As far as we know nobody will claim for rights as both companies who issued these albums have dissappeared long time ago. Historically speaking, these records do not exist here, as they belong to the pre-history of our rock `n roll scene and youth tends not to pay attention to the past. Maybe you are interested in this stuff, or maybe you already know it , we don?t know. But if you never heard this gems, we?d like to send them to you and let you know that just in case you decide to issue them, our only interest is just to bring these wonderful nuggets back from the past and in such a case to be able to distribute a few copies here. We use to go to a Sunday records and cds fair where low quality bootlegs of this material are sold for more than USD 20.00. MARCELO LILIENHEIM / MARIA GROSSI
