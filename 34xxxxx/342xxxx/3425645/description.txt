?    This film charts the rise and fall of Yuri Orlov, from his early days    ?
?    in the early 1980s in Little Odessa, selling guns to mobsters in his     ?
?    local neighbourhood, through to his ascension through the decade of      ?
?    excess and indulgence into the early 90s, where he forms a business      ?
?    partnership with an African warlord and his psychotic son. The film      ?
?    also charts his relationship through the years with his younger          ?
?    brother, his marriage to a famous model, his relentless pursuit by a     ?
?    determined federal agent and his inner demons that sway between his      ?
?    drive for success and the immorality of what he does.                    ?
