Sabrina (Salernos) video: Boys (boys boys) (Summertime love) from 1988.

This version is a bit different from the one that I downloaded from other peers a while ago. Parts of this video have the screen split up in two. On the right original video and on the left the same but in blach & whit plus the framerate is lower (frames are beeing skipped because synchronization between the two screens is kept). That gives a 'webcamera' effect. (If you know what I mean. Original audio (from vinyl) is in this and thus you can hear sometimes pops and clicks (listen carefully). 

Recorded on DVD from VH1 and tranfered on PC (MPEG-2 2500 kbps).

Enjoy this video!
