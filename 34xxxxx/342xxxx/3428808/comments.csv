Why?"
,dougkelf,2008-04-29T21:34Z,Is it one track only? Why??
,dougkelf,2008-04-29T21:36Z,Everyone should rip DTS CDs to .wav files.
,OggZ,2009-04-20T09:20Z,"What a mess. There's a huge glitch at the beginning of Rising Power, all the tracks fade together like on the radio, and it's a crappy homebrew matrixed surround sound ""mix"" that does nothing but put the differenced L+R channels in the back channels.

Foobar2000 (and I suppose a lot of other music players) can do this in software to ANY recording on the fly...so what's the point of this shit?"
