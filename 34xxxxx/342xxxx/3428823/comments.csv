,Rexxxifon,2006-01-07T17:24Z,Is this NTSC Or PAL?
,ATC4E2C,2006-01-09T05:20Z,"Rexx,

Since this is an .iso, burn it to DVD with DVD Decrypter (Google for it - it's free).  DVD Decrypter will strip it of any regionalization during the burn."
,experimental_pilot,2006-01-09T06:48Z,"Thanks!,
Does anyone have this DVD yet? http://www.onesixright.com/"
,4X-AXG,2006-01-09T18:56Z,"awesome share, can you share the DVD cover as well? I'll seed for a while after download :)"
,Rexxxifon,2006-01-09T23:12Z,"ATC, DVD Decrypter does NOT take out the PAL or NTSC Coding, it removes the Regional Coding.  If it's encoded in PAL, it won't work on Most NTSC and vice versa."
,ATC4E2C,2006-01-15T04:31Z,"Rexx, I have a DJ Tiesto DVD that was originally in PAL.  I ripped it to an .iso file, then burned with DVD-D.  It now plays in all my DVD players.  The trick is that it only works if it is an .iso file.  This is an .iso file, so it should work.  Goto to ""Tools>Settings>ISO Read"" and ensure that ""Remove RC"" and ""Remove RCE"" protection boxes are ticked."
