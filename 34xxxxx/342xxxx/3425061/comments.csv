,skicker68,2006-01-03T00:36Z,is here another link for the x264 ?
,nordes,2006-01-04T19:06Z,Any rare DVD can be sold on ebay for good $ so since you already ripped it why not sell it? Anway thanks for the upload looking forward to the movie.
,nordes,2006-01-05T19:59Z,Well it wouldnt play in either VLC or windows media player??? now what as i have no clue what codec to install to play this? Also codec packs are usually evil since they can cause havoc with a users machine. Just about everything i download plays in vlc.......... 
,biggerthanjesus,2006-01-06T12:01Z,"i can't believe what i'm reading! sickboys' post explains exactly what codec you need.

,EbenezerScrooge,2006-01-06T17:09Z,"Anyway, this was an excellent rip in every way, thanks sickboy. Though I still haven't got it running in VLC..."

,Dilated,2006-01-07T05:06Z,"Mr Himler? Do you have the version where the roid-meister actually shoots the spade over the car??? Anyway, I was very impressed! The sound / audio effects are LOUD! There's no falling asleep during this one! I dl'd this a week ago, then the torrent disappeared. Now its back. Has there been any additional work / fixes? "
,Drunken Fella,2006-01-08T22:42Z,"Thanks a lot for this state of the art rip. It plays fine on my computer, but I think such a great movie deserves to be played on a larger screen than my 17"" PC-screen and with a better sound system. Can anybody come up with a good solution on how to make this into a DVD?"
,NuisanceFactor,2006-01-09T00:10Z,Watching this on my XBox as I type this via an XBMC CLEAN release from mid December.  Picture does seem to be excellent and the audio of course is first rate.  I'd be more than happy to see more releases in this format.  Many thanks.

http://www.videohelp.com/tools?tool=Avi2Dvd

The DTS is right off the dvd, I didn't reduce it or fuck with it in any way.  I converted this the other day, and I can't tell the difference between the dvd or the conversion from the torrent.  This is on a 30"" Phillips 30PW8420/37 HDTV with the dvd being pumped out in 480P."
,Susan44,2006-04-04T03:12Z,Thanks:)  Great upload!!!
,Susan44,2006-04-05T05:16Z,It plays on my VLC player but no sound? and I have the sound on my windows media player but no picture?  Please can somone help?
,Tech-Noir,2006-07-18T15:46Z,"Great upload.

Worked from the get-go with both Media Player Classic (Part of ""XP Codec Pack 1.3.4"") aswell as in VLC, with no visible difference between them.

Although I did notice slight framedrops and some resolution drops in a few spots, most noticeably around 2:13:40. But that could be from the DVD, I wouldn't know.

Anywho, nice work. :)"
,weezl,2006-09-10T00:37Z,"My VLC (0.8.4a) crashes as soon as I start playing this file.
How do I fix this?

-weezl"
,weezl,2006-09-10T00:54Z,"OK, fixed by installing 0.8.5.
However theres definitely a sound delay (dont know  if skipping to middle causes this).

-weezl"
[T],sickboy88,2006-09-10T11:44Z,"This might help some people out...if you have a system less than 2.0ghz, don't dl this.  h.264 requires brutal processing power.  Of course the sound, and everything will be off if you have a lesser machine."
[T],sickboy88,2006-09-12T08:06Z,"I made a pack for everyone to get that contains EVERYTHING needed in order to watch my .mkv/x264 shit, as well as instructions on how to install the programs, and what options to use. 

You can download it from the following link:

Enjoy the embedded music..."
,weezl,2006-09-18T21:38Z,"Seen this movie now...apart from all the good things (like the extra scenes and so on) there is one VERY disturbing detail:
in the very last end scene john has children in an ""undisturbed"" future, which completely collides with the T3 story! so WTF is up with that?

and another unrelated thing...sickboy, wth is the ""logo picture"" on some of your rips supposed to be? is it from a concentration camp? are you some kind of fan of that?

(a third thing :P my comp has a 3,2 GHz p4 northwood and VLC uses around 1/10 of it, sound's still off, but luckily VLC has a sound delay setting that fixes it)

-weezl"
[T],sickboy88,2006-10-01T22:45Z,"The sound isn't off.  You're not using ffdshow for your dts decoder.  It's a known issue with vlc...just like when you use it to take a screenshot, and it rolls back 2 frames instead of the frame you wanted.  

I am encoding this again, for release on usenet.  There have been huge advances in the x264 codec.  Look for this on alt.binaries.movies.x264, TOMORROW.

Consider this post outdated.  Hopefully, someone will grab the new one off of usenet and upload it.  I don't seed torrents anymore though.  I can't do the bandwidth.  ""Dumbland"" was very small, and it was a one time thing.

x264 is on revision 569, this was encoded at r389...it looks like shit compared to the newer versions.

If you want to blow your eyes out, check out this release of the fifth element I put on usenet.  This is what the re-encode of t2 will look like...almost...the fifth element was taken from a superbit dvd, so naturally, it is a better source.

,domientius,2007-11-01T06:08Z,"I was gonna download this, but the ""white pride"" URL you hosted on makes me suspect you're one of those neo-Nazi bigot fags. I won't support you. You white pride mongrels make me sick. How about a death camp to send you Nazi fucks to, huh? Own up to the 6 million Jews you butchered. "

,Zangetsu_,2008-07-28T17:01Z,"@sickboy88 you could re-rip it at a higher resolution , like 846x360 or 752x320 (mod16), and higher bitrate"
