[T],RangeRick,2006-12-08T21:03Z,"not sure what's going on, but I could download it with azureus; the ""real"" bittorrent client says it was messed up though."
,kindrudekid,2007-06-05T10:05Z,Seed Please
,Luciel,2007-10-17T19:20Z,@rangerick: that's because azureus deals in DHT (tracker-less) peers as well as ones bound to a tracker. basically it finds peers out of thin air
