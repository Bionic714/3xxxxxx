Journeys to the end of the world, fantastic creatures, and epic battles between good and evil -- what more could any reader ask for? The lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, written in 1949 by Clive Staples Lewis, had all this and more. But Lewis did not stop there. Six more books followed, and together they became known as The Chronicles of Narnia. 

For the past fifty years, The Chronicles of Narnia have transcended the fantasy genre to become part of the canon of classic literature. Each of the seven books is a masterpiece, drawing the reader into a land where magic meets reality, and the result is a fictional world whose scope has fascinated generations. Now, some of the most noted actors of our times have come together to read these extraordinary works. 

This timeless boxed set includes all seven unabridged recordings: The Magician's nephew; The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe; The Horse and His Boy; Prince Caspian; The Voyage of the Dawn Treader; The Silver Chair; and The Last Battle. Deceptively simple and direct, The Chronicles of Narnia continue to captivate fans with adventures, characters, and truths that speak to readers of all ages, even fifty years after they were first published. 


Jag har inte lyssnat genom dem så jag vet inte säkert att alla funkar.
Ha överseende om jag gör något fel, detta är den första torrenten jag seedar.
