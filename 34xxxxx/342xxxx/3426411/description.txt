"Remarkably, Bob Dylan first visited Britain to take
part in a BBC play. It was the coldest winter on record:
Britain was frosty and grey. Millions of milk bottles
were buried in snow drifts, Cliff was number one, and
there were two TV channels and three radio stations
(all BBC). This was the world a 21-year-old Bob Dylan
entered when he visited London for the first time in
December 1962, having never left America before."

Note: though this was a 16:9 broadcast, almost
all of it is pillarboxed 4:3 archive footage
(actually a bit wider). If you`re watching on a
4:3 monitor or tv you might prefer to pan-scan
the picture to fill the screen.
