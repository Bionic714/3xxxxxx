In the year 1876, the followers of the god Azag-Thot created a lot of excitement in Africa. The brotherhood of Marduk and the follower of Anubis fought against the Azag-Thot clan. Great luck that the historian Howard Hawk (you) traveled through Africa and supported the Marduk/Anubis clan against the Azag-Thot.

In this game, you play Howard Hawk, the aforementioned historian. In 15 different areas of Africa he can use his father's old rifle. There are lots of Azag-Thot munchs, cursed spidermen, or other terrible creatures. In every area is at least one occult place where mighty books, broken amulets or magic swords can be found. Only with these goods can the Azag-Thot be defeated. 

By your quest you were supported from up to 6 African inhabitants. These are carrying your equipment. By the time you learn some magic that help you to solve your quest.
