(!)For people who don't know how to play Anamorphic widescreen movies with computer in correct aspect ratio: this movie has wider aspect ratio than 16:9, use Media Player Classic and press numpad2 several times to decrease height of picture. This rip is especially for those who like to watch movies via widescreen TV and it looks amazing when played from standalone DVD-player.
