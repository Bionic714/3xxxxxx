,MuSickFinder,2006-01-04T17:46Z,What the hell is happening with these pages? First all comments disappeared and now there's some ads at the bottom of my description... :S
,Mylbas,2006-01-06T21:17Z,"Whats wrong with the sound? When I play it on my computer in windows media player, I can barely hear the voices...:-("
,MuSickFinder,2006-01-07T15:42Z,"That's because of Dolby Digital. I didn't raise the sound level from the original. Especially if you listen with two speakers you may suffer from downmixing from 5.1 to 2.0, which can decrease the sound level/volume. For me it sounds fine when played in home theater system."
,MuSickFinder,2006-01-08T00:45Z,"Yes, I did spend quite a lot effort ripping these movies to ensure the quality and functionality, especially in DivX-players. Btw ratings would be highly appreciated.. ;)"
,lullabubby,2006-01-08T03:42Z,"i've tried watching this on xbox. i burned to dvd as avi's str8 from torrent. i've tried all the aspect ratios 
available in xbmc and it just looks stretched out. is 
there something i'm missing cause to me it doesn't look right. btw my tv isn't widescreen."
,MuSickFinder,2006-01-08T12:21Z,"Regular TV is the problem. There's nothing to be done with it, sorry."
,lullabubby,2006-01-08T17:50Z,"guess i'll have to run out and buy that plasma!
;)"
,I8aBaby,2006-01-10T20:37Z,"Had some trouble at first with sound and aspect ratio, but then i opened up in nero showview2 and forced the aspect raito to 51:20 (2,55:1) and it was just perfect picture and sound... Now I will watch one in ratio 2,35:1 and see if that's better... Thanks for a great upload, although it took a very long time."
,I8aBaby,2006-01-11T19:03Z,"I ment of course nero showtime2, the player that comes with nero 7 De Luxe Edition. The film was a little better in the bastard format 2.35:1, whatever happened to the superior classic cinemascope format (2.55:1)..."
,daelsato,2006-01-16T08:09Z,can some1 tell where i can find english subs for this movie or spanish subs?  i need for translations to all idioms!
,SadBeef2,2006-01-22T19:44Z,"if youre watching it in xbox media center, press start while its playing, and there should be a menu option that allows you to change the aspect ratio (i believe its the very top option).  fiddle with it while watching the new line cinema intro reel and you'll get a proper aspect ratio in a few seconds."

,Drunken Fella,2006-01-28T17:30Z,"Great rip! Thanx a lot! One minus: 192 kbps is not a high enough bitrate for a 5.1 DD track :( sounds very ""digitalized""... Plays very fine both on my computer and on my Philips DVD737 stand-alone player."
,MuSickFinder,2006-01-29T19:24Z,"I know, minimum recommended is 224 kbps, but it was a compromise I made in favor for video quality"
[V],DarkSnow,2006-01-30T03:37Z,"Thanks, great release :)"
,MrMoony,2006-02-01T14:31Z,"When you burn the films to DVD-format,how do you get the subs to the DVD? Please let me know! I'm new at this,I know!  THANXX!"
,MuSickFinder,2006-02-01T15:51Z,"Hmm... I'm new to that too, but a fast Google search will help ;) You need Srt2Sup and IFOEdit, they should do the job...somehow. Here's a link for the detailed guide: http://www.videohelp.com/forum/userguides/197950.php"
,Drunken Fella,2006-02-01T18:31Z,"I earlier posted a comment stating that 192kbps is too low a bitrate, it still is, but after I tried playing the DVD using an external amplifier with build-in DD-decoder, it certainly made a difference; sounded much better... :D"
,jimasp,2006-02-03T11:05Z,"Thanks a lot, Great rip! =)"
,adxgrave,2006-02-06T03:17Z,Great rip! Where can i get the english sub for this?
,adxgrave,2006-02-06T03:22Z,"Comment sorting has change. The latest comment is at the bottom of the page.. and about the english sub, pls PM me.. Thanks."
,Trady,2006-02-06T15:36Z,"Got the same question MrMoony 

""When you burn the films to DVD-format,how do you get the subs to the DVD? Please let me know""

I have looked at the guide provided by MuSickFinder

but there sure has to be a easier way......"
,MuSickFinder,2006-02-06T18:34Z,"Well, in any case the conversion into bitmap is required, because DVD doesn't support textfiles. There seem to be no shortcut into things as far as I know (like SubRip is when ripping subtitles from DVD)."
,CyberWoolf_,2006-02-08T19:46Z,Where can I find english subtitles ?
,Audiocat,2006-02-09T11:08Z,"For all you with soundproblems. Use mediaplayer classic, press O (get the properties screen)  Press ""filters -> Audio switcher"" Check ""Enable custom channel mapping""

Select Speaker configuration for 6 input channels. Uncheck everything, then check 1,2,3,4,5,6 on ""front left"" and do the same with ""Front right""

Then ""ok""

You now mapped all your 5.1 channels to be played through front left & right

Peace"

I did what Audiocat told. But still I am facing the same sound glitches. I have a 4.1 speaker system. What do I do?"
,MuSickFinder,2006-02-15T12:55Z,"What kind of clithes? Have you tried changing settings in AC3Filter? Can't really help much because I don't have surround system in computer, but this I can tell that in my Real home theater system these movies work like a charm."

,katekukku,2006-02-16T15:01Z,"The sound is not at all clear on my 4.1. What do I do? But if I convert it through Nero Recode, its awesome. Media Player Classic is not helping. AC3 filter is not helping. Someone please help me."
,thacause,2006-02-16T16:55Z,"I will help SEED this one.

Awsome quality ! "
,katekukku,2006-02-17T17:48Z,Just updated from KLMcodec 1.45 to 1.50. The movie is working fine. Excellent quality overall.
,yoitsmayo,2006-02-22T02:08Z,"took me a ass long time to download! but worth it completely. excellent sound, quality, everything. only problem is theres no english subtitles for the elven tongue. 

btw aspect ratio is 18:9"

,anonim1979,2006-03-01T23:05Z,Yes but you have to do this every time! It is not saved into the file and you need ffdshow on every computer you want to play it.

its definitly my best download so far from this site

for some reasons u didn't include the ""forced subtitles"" (translation of elvish dialogue) with the movies
i downloaded the english subtitles for the three movies from subtitles sites and i edited them and synchronised them (using subtitle workshop) with the movies and i corrected all spelling mistakes (with OpenOffice.org Writer)
so its all perfect, but i just realised that the subtitles doesn't include the translation of elvish dialogue (ie, forced subtitles)
luckly i actualy own the 1st LOTR extended edition on dvd, so i extracted the forced subtitles (elvish dialogue translation) and added them to the subtitles, and its all perfect :)"

   Happy Easter back at ya' !"
,MuSickFinder,2006-03-18T00:31Z,"I haven't noticed any difference either, that's why I haven't used this option. The flag may require ffdshow or some other more advanced decoder than ""regular"" xvid codec... not sure. If it works you should only change the display aspect ratio to 2.35:1 as mentioned earlier."
,anonim1979,2006-03-18T08:28Z,"VLC works 100% - it has its own codec inside [ they accept aspect ratio in xvid and divx films]
The rest of PC players accept AR IF codec support it."
,anonim1979,2006-03-18T08:29Z,XVID codec accept aspect ratio - so when you watch using it NO problems - you can also FORCE divx films to be decoded by xvid codec [in codec options set FourCC for divx and div5]
,anonim1979,2006-03-18T08:31Z,Divx Codec DONT support Aspect Ratio - so if you don't have xvid installed / or you forced playing xvid films using divx codec USE VLC.
,anonim1979,2006-03-18T08:34Z,"Those films are coded in xvid so you shouldnt have problems as long you have xvid instaled [use newest version to be sure].
I dont know about ffdshow IF it doesnt work properly  you can [temporary] disable in it decoding divx/xvid films by ffdshow."
,MuSickFinder,2006-03-18T12:12Z,"I have the latest xvid installed and it doesn't do a thing in any of my video players. Have to try VLC again. Seems like this flag option causes more trouble than it is worth =D It isn't relly much more troublesome to manually change aspect ratio into 2.35:1 in VLC or in MPC, so enough of this subject already. What's done is done. I'll will look into this flag thing more carefully in the future."
,Gowad,2006-03-20T12:44Z,hello
,MuSickFinder,2006-03-20T17:01Z,"Update: For using xvid's aspect ratio flag you have to select unrestricted profile which isn't very wise keeping in mind hardware compatibility. And what's best, changing aspect ratio flag changes also pixel ratio automatically, killing hardware player compatibility. End of debate."

i have this problem see, ive downloaded this trioligy with the intent of burning it to dvd's.
now, I burned the first movie with nero, made a menu and etc. but when i got to the burning part i was a bit suspicious becouse the burning process looked different fro mwhen i burned other movies, now when i was done i put the dvd in my dvd player to watch the goddie on my tv i got to the menu alright but when i started the movie it turned dark and it appears i only burned the audio on the dvd coz there was no picture, i took out the dvd and looked att the tracks, and only about half was burned on it, but when i used nero it said it would be about 4.37gb burned(4,7gb's dvd disc) now what am i doing wrong here? plz help me! sorry about the long text."

Monitor Used: Samsung LCD 21.5"" LCD
Resolution: 1920x1080
Speakers: 2.1 Cambridge Soundworks THX

Video was great, sure it was kinda boxy/pixelated by perfectly fine for my monitor. Audio, well, I don't understand why people are complaining. It is plenty loud, and well, I have heard much quieter than this!!

Video: 9.5/10
Audio: 9/10

If you worried or don't think that this will be good quality (i.e. tolerable) go and rent the DVDs/Blu-Ray"

,mcordell,2010-09-26T19:55Z,Average speed on this torrent (~450 kb/s).  Good quality: it's DVD quality people not blu-ray quality!  They don't even have the extended trilogy available for blu-ray yet!

The times are correct on the movies. The uploader removed the  ""Special Thanks"" sections at the end of the movies. There was a fan club before Fellowship was released and everyone who joined got their name added to the ""Special Thanks"" section at the end of the credits. That's why the run times are 8-9mins too short. There are that many names in the ""Special Thanks"" section!

As for the audio/subtitle issues, I resolved them with the English sub downloads (.srt files) a few pages back posted by someone in these comments. The audio and subs can be shown with the KLite codec pack. I downloaded the ""Mega"" pack and while installing selected ""lots of stuff (no player)"" and kept it default. Then you set your AC3 settings with the AC3 codec to whatever your speaker setup is and turn the ""main"" all the way up or to whatever you desire. The audio quality is quite amazing. Make sure your .srt file name matches the video file name ex: Fellowship.avi/Fellowship.srt and put the two files in the same directory. If you follow my steps you can watch it on WMP and you won't have to waste your time with other media players."

,Unit431,2011-01-25T08:18Z,"Video quality is decent, but the aspect ratio is wrong. It's 16:9 or 16:10 when it's supposed to be 2.39:1. The videos look all stretched out as a result.

I'd suggest giving this torrent a pass if you're planning on ripping it to a DVD but don't know how to adjust the aspect ratio. Though if you watch movies on your PC, you can easily fix the problem by playing the movies in VLC Media Player and going to Video -> Aspect Ratio -> 2.39:1."

I have looked and the only ones i can find are the ones for either the normal edition or with it split into Disc 1 and 2. Otherwise this is a great torrent thanks"

If you are saying the audio is crap, you're wrong. I'm playing it on a 2.0 system (I say system, it's a TV) and just downmixing the 5.1 channels into stereo. It sounds almost as good as the BluRay rip I have.

,estudyante_blues,2011-08-01T21:54Z,"For those of you who still have audio problems hope this could help. You may use VLC as your media player. After opening the movie, go to Audio then choose Audio Device. Probably 5.1 is the default or checked. Just change it to Stereo. It fix mine and hope yours too.

Great movie quality!"
,Godpk11,2011-08-09T19:25Z,"Alright it finished downloading. I decided to get this to see whether the Audio people say is crap and I partly agree. When the characters whisper or talk low, I have to raise my volume to the max (on my laptop). BUT when I put headphones on, it makes a huge difference obviously. The music, sound effects are great, except the talking. All in all, still a great torrent uploaded. Thanks."
