Trapt, yet another nu-metal entry from southern California, proffers an eponymous major-label debut that is as enthusiastic as it is plagiaristic. There is an organic feel to the disc that separates it from their more angst-ridden peers, specifically those who rely on electronic gadgetry over a simple guitar-bass-drums setup, though the congenial feel fits in alongside Incubus, especially with a propensity toward pensive moments that evoke a softer image than most, one that would fit into emo if the band wasn't so obviously aesthetically a rock band; "These Walls" actually sounds like Nickelback at its most adult rock-radio-friendly, for example. Trapt isn't original, per se, as much as it does a good job melding its pronounced influences more seamlessly than most; the band would get a better recommendation if the record had songs that stood out a bit more.
