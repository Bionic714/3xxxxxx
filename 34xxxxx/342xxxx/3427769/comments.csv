,shinmai,2006-01-08T18:16Z,"System Shock 1 and 2, the classic RPG/Horror Survival/FPS games that broke the barriers between porn- and normal games :D"
,Hagios,2006-01-11T16:45Z,"Heh, yeah.  Take this as a lesson--don't upload torrents after an all nighter and a few pints.  The category would be changed if I could, but a doublepost doesn't seem appropriate."

,Phaedrus_x,2007-11-24T14:28Z,"Will someone please explain what sense it makes to upload a torrent and then not seed it? Unless you're just trying to make everyone waste their time, in which case, mission accomplished! Unfortunately, that also makes you a cock-knob."
