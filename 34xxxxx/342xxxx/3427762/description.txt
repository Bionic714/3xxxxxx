How you know that all data you downloaded is safe from hdd-crasches? 
Try this to increase safety:

"HDD Health is a full-featured failure-prediction agent for machines using 
Windows 95, 98, NT, Me, 2000 and XP. Sitting in the system tray, it monitors 
hard disks and alerts you to impending failure. The program uses 
Self Monitoring and Reporting Technology (S.M.A.R.T.) built into all new 
hard disks, and can predict failures on your hard drives. A host of alerting 
features include email, local pop-up messages, net messages, and event 
logging, while using no system resources."

And I still know that its freeware and can be downloaded at www.pantera.com
But I still think people need to know about it. Maybe it rescues someone?s 
data.
(But the best is still regular backups)
