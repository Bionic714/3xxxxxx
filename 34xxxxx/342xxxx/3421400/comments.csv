And ""seeking the stone"" sounds very promising too... :)"
,Siphersh,2006-06-30T02:53Z,There's a seeder... :) That's nice.
,Siphersh,2006-07-03T14:43Z,Yay! The Norwegian guy did it! :)
,Siphersh,2006-07-05T12:05Z,Aww... The Norwegian guy doesn't seed. :( Now we are left without seeds. :(
,Siphersh,2006-07-12T19:03Z,Am I the only one having problems playing the Alien Dreamtime.avi file? It seems to be corrupted. Is that possible?

He is really at it! :)

Thanks, guys!"
