Seeking the Stone
An eloquent perspective by Terence McKenna on the idea of a spiritual path for all and an impending transformation of the human world. In his singularly lucid, prosaic style, McKenna presents profoundly compelling ideas that challenge our beliefs and encourage our participation in the creation of a new social reality. He champions the individual?s freedom of choice in deciding one?s own sexual and spiritual development and techniques. He highlights the role of hallucinogenic plants in shamanic societies and their impact on the evolution of human cultures. See why this cyber-techno-shaman is drawing freethinking crowds wherever he speaks and find out what role you may play in the unfolding of our ?post-historical future? as we approach a major ?concresence? in human history.

The World ...and Its Double
A full day excursion into the questions he explores with unequaled imagination, where is life carrying us? What is the nature of that other world which co-exists with this one? What is the role of shamanic plants in shaping our consciousness? Hear WHAT IS TIME ALL ABOUT--The brief interval we call life: between the Unknown and the Unspoken. TRT 1:36.

Alien Dreamtime
featuring:
Words - Terence McKenna
Visuals - Rose X
Music - Spacetime Continuum
Didgeridu - Stephen Kent
Alien Dreamtime was produced as a live multi-media event in San Francisco, on the evenings of February 26 and 27, 1993.
The performance is divided into three movements, each reflective of Terence McKenna's ethnobotanical theories: Archaic Revival, Alien Love and Time Wave Zero.

McKenna's presence is combined with the neo-psychedelic visuals of Rose X and ambient techno improvisations by Space Time Continuum and didgeridusita, Stephen Kent.

Take a trip without breaking the law.


Enjoy!
