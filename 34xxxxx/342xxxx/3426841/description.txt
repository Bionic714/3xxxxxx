        *** YES YOU CAN BURN THIS ISO AND PLAY IT IN YOUR XBOX-360 ***
        Microsoft left us with this blanket statement: 
        "Xbox 360 retail kiosks have started arriving at retailers.
        Due to the nature of the distribution process, not all kiosks
        are hitting simultaneously, but are continuing to pop up in
        retailers across the country in the coming weeks.
        The kiosks are designed for a retail environment and feature
        game samples, game trailers and product information." 
        Team Pi leaves you with this Pillow statement:
        "It seems Microsoft was in such a hurry to get this stuff out
        that they forgot to set the media protection on this disc.
        This leaves hackers with the posibility to hack around with
        this disc that load from a normal DVDR5 backup! - Team Pi
        also notes that the all datafiles on this disc isn't signed in
        any way, and will allow for extensive modification for producing
        exploits to further our efford to hack this box!"
        Playable (hackable) games on this disc:
          Call of Duty 2, Hexic, Kameo, King Kong.
        Also includes lots of game and accessory demos in video format.
        Nothing ripped, just foreign videos were downsampled to fit
        onto a normal DVDR5!

      ?????      SPECIAL NOTE         _ __/     /  / /____ __ _  ?????
      ??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
        YES you can run this! Burn the iso, put it into your xbox and
        be very amazed... Next, think of the posibilities of hacking
        this little demo disc that we might start running code on
        the retail xbox 360's ! :)
        So the second task is done. We hope this encourages all hackers,
        coders and crackers out there to take up the challenge.
        Enjoy!
        
        Special note to the Clear kids: Yes, we are old and lazy, and no,
        we are not going to do some scene war against you. Life is too
        short for that, and our dicks are allready large enough :)
        
        Keep up the hard work!
                  Pi Putting the 360' Spin on the Xbox :-)
