Metropolis is an album made by me, Ossian Bor√©n. It is a journey through the rise and fall of a futuristic city. I don't know what to call the sound, but I am influnced by mainly post-rock and electronica. I sing on most songs, with mostly improvised lyrics, I'd like to focus on the music. Also, I haven't used a single real instrument on any of the songs. All the music was programmed in Reason. Vocals were added in Garageband.
