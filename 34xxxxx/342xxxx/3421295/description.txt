Peter Baumann's second album "Trans Harmonic Nights" (1979) rescued in high qaulity from DAT and then MP3 encoded at 256 kbit/s. 

This album is, in my opinion, just as great as his first album "Romance 76".

Not available on CD anymore, as far as I know. This gem must be saved for the future. Don't forget to download my other torrent with the full "Romance 76" album:

(times are approximate and the tracks in this torrent are usually a few seconds shorter due to editing of silence before and after music on each track)

If anyone has more music from Peter Baumann I ask you to share it with the rest of us! It's just impossible to find it the legal way. I would gladly pay for this music if I could buy it somewhere.
