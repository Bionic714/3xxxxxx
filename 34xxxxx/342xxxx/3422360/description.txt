This is a single PDF of an introductory neurobiology textbook, good for searching in one fell swoop.
Original chapter PDFs were garnered from:

http://www.whfreeman.com/college/pdfs/kolb_whishaw_2e/CHnn.qxd.pdf

(Where 'nn' is the chapter number, 01-15. There is also EPILOGUE.pdf in that directory)

Many (but not all) of the chapters are also available in low resolution and much smaller file sizes at

http://www.whfreeman.com/college/pdfs/kolb_whishaw_2e/lo_res_pdfs/

...with the same file naming scheme as above. I used the low-res versions in the combined file when possible.
