,N2h,2006-01-04T15:18Z,guys what will happen ifyou try to do a windows update withthis installed has anyone tried it?
,spoxxy,2006-01-06T02:11Z,"Installed it, but it's just normal windows XP!!! it says windows MCE 2002 in system info. It is also NOT unattended install.I see zero diff between it and any regular XP install disk. Weird!"
,romanamor,2006-01-06T23:11Z,"Mine says Version 2002 also, but I was able to add the MCE 2005 Rollup 2 to this.  (After updating .Net 1.1 and .Net 1.1 SP1.)  

After this is done, get the Windows Media Connect to hook this into your Xbox 360.

I don't think I could have done any of this if it was MCE 2002... must be 2005."

,dsfn,2006-02-04T14:21Z,"To use Windows update do following:
---
Before pressing 'Custom' or 'Express' buttons paste this text to the address bar and press enter: 
javascript:void(window.g_sDisableWGACheck='all') 

It turns off the trigger for the key check.

,r0tt3n,2006-10-05T18:51Z,"I sincerely hope people make it down far enough to get to my post...

I was very concerned that finally someone made an unattended 1-disk install of MCE 2K5, but that people were reporting it to be fake, saying that it was ""Version 2002"".  So I decided to take a look at my store-bought media center 2005 in my den, and sure enough... here's what it said when I right-clicked 'My Computer' and hit properties:

System:
  Microsoft Windows XP
  Media Center Edition
  Version 2002
  Service Pack 2

And this is Media Center 2005!  Imagine my surprise, and no wonder people were suspicious, although the fact that someone reported they successfully installed the ""Windows XP Media Center 2005 Rollup 2"" update certainly hinted that it must be legit.

Anyways, the point is this:  ALL WINDOWS XP MEDIA CENTER 2005'S SAY VERSION 2002 IN THE SYSETM PROPERTIES!!  So have faith that this release is legit.

P.S. It's worth noting that this disk DOES have the crack included, and that downloading the latest update and installing it doesn't disable the crack, so happy media-centering!"

,WinnieXL,2006-11-07T22:41Z,Cannot install any thing. If i try ATI display driver it says RPC disabled or whetever.
,merlwiz79,2007-01-08T00:44Z,"This IS WINDOWS MCE 2005
It's Windows XP/2002 PRO with MCE 2005."
,Tskio,2007-03-12T19:05Z,"This worked perfectly for me, completely
unattended. Also, just for anyone who is curious, I installed this on my Macbook Pro. This Copy of windows works perfectly with Boot Camp."
,Rinadien,2008-02-18T21:11Z,"Quick question about this version, after completing the crack, i still have the Activate Windows shortcut in my start menu... Now i'm only bringing this up because i already have a version of MCE that after cracking following their instructions, the same thing happened... Windows said it was activated, but the shortcut's still there...

Unfortunately, after 60 days, windows was no longer activated, and i was unable to log back on after a reboot. Does this version address that problem? Or will I have to reinstall it in 60 days?

Also, the instructions mention replacing a file in the \windows\system32\dllcache folder... however i was unable to find this folder anywhere on the partition. Will this cause an issue or will it be fine. Thanks for the input. "
,Rinadien,2008-02-18T21:57Z,"cacheDLL was finally formed, but windows did not pass validation..."
,DefCharlie,2008-03-13T14:23Z,"I have had some toubles setting up too, here's how I succeeded:

I first renamed the original winlogon.exe, wich i found in C:\windows\system32\ to winlogonbackup.exe, I then copied the crack version to that directory... then reboot... and bingo.

See, you cannot DELETE winlogon, but you can RENAME it, after wich you can with it whatever you want.

Good luck "
