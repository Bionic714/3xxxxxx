Like its film counterpart, the soundtrack to The Crow: City of Angels suffers from the law of diminishing returns. Where the soundtrack to the first Crow film was a state-of-the-art alternative sampler, drawing from both mainstream favorites like Stone Temple Pilots and cult legends like the Cure and Henry Rollins, City of Angels is, by and large, pure calculated schlock. Most offensive is two ludicrously lunkheaded covers of late-'70s warhorses -- White Zombie's take on KC & the Sunshine Band's "I'm Your Boogie Man" and Hole's version of Fleetwood Mac's "Gold Dust Woman." With all the loud guitars and hoarse bellows in the right places, both songs are embarrassingly predictable, humorless, and clueless. Compartively, Bush's "In a Lonely Place" and Iggy Pop's tired runthrough of "I Wanna Be Your Dog" seem impressive. Then again, the overall lackluster quality masks the excellence of PJ Harvey's chilling "Naked Cousin." However, nothing can extinguish the urban nightmare of Tricky's throwaway contribution. Even though he just hands in a relatively average B-side, there is more style, invention, and genuine menace in that one song than all of the angst-ridden grunge posturing that clutters the rest of the album.
