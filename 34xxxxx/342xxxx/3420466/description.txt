Leuchter published a controversial reportconfirming Zundel's position, which ultimately ruined his own career.Most of the footage is of Leuchter, puttering around executionfacilities or chipping away at the walls of Auschwitz, but Morris alsointerviews various historians, associates, and neighbors.

Please spare a thought for revisionist historians Ernst Zundel, David Irving, Germar Rudolph and others, presently imprisoned in Europe for what amounts to "thought crimes", offering research and evidence that undermine the current version of The Holocaust.

The truth does not imprison people. We have a right to know what happened, and a duty to the memory of the dead, and to the legacy of the living to have an accurate account of these events.
