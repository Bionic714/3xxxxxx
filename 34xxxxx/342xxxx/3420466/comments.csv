For the rest of the world, this is the tale of a rather sad, mousey, middle aged man who, perhaps motived by boredom and/or a desire for fame, leaps at the opportunity to connect himself to the Holocaust denial movement.  In the process, he manages to destroy his reputation, his personal life, and his career.

It is truly questionable whether Holocaust deniers should be prosecuted just for their denials.  Far less questionable is the fact that Leuchter is a fool."

I am not a jew but I feel I must say this. Some people dislike jews because they´ve been brainwashed by the christian churches for centuries that they are the killers of jesus (big lie, the romans did it...), also the envy they cause because being a people without a country for ages they had to work hard and save and thus many of them were well to do, it´s a sick attitude towards THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO DIDN´T SUBMIT TO THE ROMANS, their oppression and repression, that´s why they were expelled from their land, for that they should be admired, not hated, but so is the worst aspect of human nature, despise the freedom lovers and admire the brainless nazis who submitted to the criminal bohemian corporal Schickelgruber (hitler´s REAL name), a bunch of spiteful losers all of them. Such liars that carefully hide the facts in national archives that many thousands jews fought and died for Germany, Austria, France, England, etc. in wars, even getting medals for bravery... The holocaust was the reward the nazis gave them..."
