MAJOR MISCONCEPTION:
-------------------------------------------------------
Most of the people think Muslims believe in different God, but they don't. Allah means in Arabic the God (ilah - god, al - the, thus Allah is the God). Arabic speaking Christians and Jews call the God Allah as well.

Thus Islam is the religion of the One True God, which sent Judaism, and Christianity before. Unfortunately they were corrupted by the followers, so God has sent Islam as the Last Tastement.

Prophet Muhammad was illiterate and he had the Quran revealed from God during his prophethood that lasted 23 years. Thus allegations that he wrote the Quran is absolute false.
