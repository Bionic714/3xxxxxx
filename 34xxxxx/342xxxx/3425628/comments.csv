,JAMHOT,2006-01-09T15:49Z,Can't get this to work on me psp tried renaming the files nothin bupkiss nadda! Any help would be greatly appreciated! 
,danny_kay1710,2006-01-14T01:45Z,It may be encoded with the AVC codec if your psp's firmware is 1.5 then it won't play only sony psp firmware 2.0 and above will play it - if your that set on playing it head on to pspupdates.qj.net where you can download a custom 1.5 firmware with these codecs you will need to download MPH's firmware launcher too tho and play it once the firmware has launched. Readme files are included seem to be easy to follow them

After 640 downloads I only had 2 comments.
It must be very frustrating to download and it does not play.
So I have done another one in the hope that this one works

Because I have lots to share!! So this is the new one
