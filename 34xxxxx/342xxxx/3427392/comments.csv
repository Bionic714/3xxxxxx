The genocide in Darfur has claimed 400,000 lives and displaced over 2,500,000 people. More than one hundred people continue to die each day; five thousand die every month."
,NegatoryNegatory,2006-01-03T19:37Z,"""Every day we surveyed evidence of killings: men castrated and left to bleed to death, huts set on fire with people locked inside, children with their faces smashed in, men with their ears cut off and eyes plucked out, and the corpses of people who had been executed with gunshots to the head."
,NegatoryNegatory,2006-01-03T19:37Z,"In 1948, the United Nations drafted an international definition of genocide in the hopes of preventing another Holocaust. The convention determined that ?genocide means any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such: Killing members of the group; Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group; Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part; Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group; or Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.? If the UN declares a group guilty of genocide, member countries are bound to act. Strangely enough, however, in February 2005, the UN reported that the Khartoum were not guilty of committing genocide. They instead found that crimes against humanity and war crimes were taking place in Darfur."
,NegatoryNegatory,2006-01-03T19:39Z,"Is the news really fair and balanced? To not report these atrocities is a crime in itself. Ask yourself and others what is wrong with the media, that the worlds biggest crisis goes unreported each and every day? It is costing more lives."

Please remember, every person that you enlighten to the situation in Darfur increases the chances of lives being saved.
