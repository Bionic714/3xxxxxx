,BraunB4Brain,2008-04-15T00:22Z,Cosmic Charlie in Dick's Picks Vol. 20 is incorrect. This version is actually the same as the one in Aoxomoxoa. Eyes of the World is unfortunately cut off a few minutes before the end of the song in Dick's Picks Vol. 18. These problems are not life threatening though. Great torrent. Thanks for it!

Thousands of free downloadable Grateful Dead live shows. Many shows available in multiple formats (SHN, MP3 & FLAC).  Plus free streaming auto. Check it out. This is a must have page for any Grateful Dead music collector.

Here is a little extra info on the site:
""The Internet Archive is a 501(c)(3) non-profit that was founded to build an Internet library, with the purpose of offering permanent access for researchers, historians, and scholars to historical collections that exist in digital format. Founded in 1996 and located in the Presidio of San Francisco, the Archive has been receiving data donations from Alexa Internet and others. In late 1999, the organization started to grow to include more well-rounded collections. Now the Internet Archive includes texts, audio, moving images, and software as well as archived web pages in our collections."""
,masterof47,2010-06-16T22:30Z,Many thanks for uploading the Dick's Picks volumes! As a young adult who only became aware of the Grateful Dead in the last year these shows are a great way for me to explore their music. Like Antelope15 I encourage anyone to check out  archive.org who hasn't. Thank you again zaftra for sharing this music!
,GrokkoW,2012-03-29T21:57Z,Really? Going to complain about free shit you took the time to look for and have to willingly download by choice?
,GrokkoW,2012-05-24T13:20Z,Thanks Dude! I used to have all of these back in the days when CDs were all the rage! lol I don't know what to do when I'm limited to only about 50 Dead shows to choose from. 
,Zoticus,2012-06-10T05:04Z,"DP 20 is mostly from a 1985 show in Richmond, Virginia (complete here).  Only the last few tracks on the third disc come from Rochester."
,Zoticus,2012-06-10T05:44Z,"Oops, ^^ correction: I meant DP 21, not 20."
,Zoticus,2012-06-16T18:55Z,"Re: DP 20 from 1976: Disc 1 has ""Samson and Delilah"" from Disc 4 where ""New Minglewood Blues"" should be. ""NMB"" is just absent from this torrent.  Likewise, on Disc 2, the ""Cosmic Charlie"" included is the studio version from Aoxomoxoa.  Again, the live version is just absent.  (Also, the file naming and tag editing throughout this particular Picks is atrociously inconsistent. I love free stuff, but not when it's cobbled together so shoddily. You wouldn't give smelly stained underwear to Goodwill and expect a big ""thank you.""  Take some pride in your work, people!)"
