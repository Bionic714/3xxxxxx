Asians tryin out their hip hop skills.  I think it's hilarious.  Everyone should find this enjoyable.

"From humble beginnings off the streets of New York's Chinatown, these three restaurant workers have carved a path of destruction through the music industry and will not stop until every man, woman and child has succumbed to their sizzling, orange-flavored beats."

The video is a much watch for anybody.  I cracked up the first 10 times I watched it.  "I killed 10 people with a frying pan!"
This is my first upload. Let me know if there are any problems.  Will try to seed for a while.  I think this needs to get out there.  It was time consuming getting the video and the songs. Don't be afraid to comment.
