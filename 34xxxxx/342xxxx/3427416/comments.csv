[V],Hexen-NI,2006-01-03T23:24Z,I'm seeding - tracker is down.
,jeffblake,2006-01-04T01:44Z,Thanx for sharing
,FSSR.Keyno,2006-01-04T06:00Z,Vol 1 of 21? wow gonna release all? wish wish
,Foxxen,2006-01-04T08:38Z,"Don't know how the quality is, but I would prefer if you could upload these ones in DVD9 format. Myself would rip of the colorversions to save videoquality. It feels anyway weird watching a movie in color when it's remade. ;-) And a big thanx for this one!!!"
,zentorius,2006-01-04T11:01Z,I would prefer DVDRip XviD ... thanks anyway for uploading.
,denzel-uk,2006-01-04T15:18Z,"thanks so much..i am not dlaoding this disk because its the only one i have a copy of, but cant wait for disks 2 and 3 thsoe have the most awesome, wonderful comedy on there, thx so much keep it up!

ps about quality, i am mainly after color versions as i have black and whie divx, so this is great, and i guess it will be basically bigkev's rips so i saw disk one and it is ok. thx"
,=michael=,2006-01-04T15:51Z,is this a orginal dvd. i didnt know that there was a dvd of laurel and hardy thanks mate!
,jonahx,2006-01-09T13:16Z,"i've finally got 100%. ver nice indeed. However, I hadn't noticed there where only english subs on it. Is it possible to make custom subs in some way and add them to the DVD?"
,jonahx,2006-01-09T13:17Z,Forgot to mention that I will keep sharing this release until Vol 2 arrives. I have limited HDD storage so can only share 1 at a time.
,morrislollo,2006-01-09T18:43Z,SEED for Gods sake!!!!!
,wolf359,2006-01-10T19:44Z,Brilliant quality...Thanks!!! Please do keep them coming in the same format :)
,grunthos,2006-02-26T01:25Z,"Wow - amazing. I cant wait for this lot to be complete (all 21 discs!!!)
I have some real old stuff on video that I have NEVER seen anywhere else. if they don't turn up on the DVD's (which I doubt) I will do a video transfer for you guys.
CU"

,dedikkeendedunne,2007-08-26T13:02Z,"someone please upload DVD5 again, it seems to be missing from tracker.

,Ianpbx,2009-09-06T20:21Z,"This is not a complaint, just a hope that someone may pick up on it. It would be better if someone could upload this with only the black & white versions, as the colour is not only fake but also crap. And also transcode to XVid for smaller size with good quality."
,mimimax,2011-07-12T18:19Z,"I have a big wish - any who will seed this great movie. I love Laurel and Hardy. they are/were great comedians.
