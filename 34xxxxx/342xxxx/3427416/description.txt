Burn this onto DVDR using your favourite DVD burning software - 
if you don't know how to burn these onto DVDR's, get Nero and search
on Google.  Then print the DVD Cover and DVD Inlay Booklet (oh yes
you get this too).


I noticed that some of the colour versions are slightly shorter
than the B&W versions.  In Brats, for example, you'll see that
some small scenes were cut out of the colour version and so is
shorter than the restored B&W version.  Brats is on DVD Vol 5.

This is the 1st of 21 DVD's, will some of you leave a comment on
Pirate Bay regarding quality etc.  If you say the quality is bad,
I'll need to re-encode - your feedback is important as all the 20
remaining DVD's will be done the same way!  Note that colourised
versions are not as sharp as the B&W versions, although this is
normal if you've ever viewed a colourised version before.
