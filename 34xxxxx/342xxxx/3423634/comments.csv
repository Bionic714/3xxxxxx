,TheMace,2007-08-07T23:48Z,"Hey, just a quick couple o'questions:
1: Narutimate hero 3, is this the same as narutomate shippuuden accel?

2: Does this game has english SUBS and japanese VOICE-OVERS?

thx to anyone that can clear this up."
,killalil,2007-10-09T06:38Z,does ur ps2 need 2 b JAP
,Midfrost,2007-10-10T21:49Z,"Your PS2 needs to be chipped with up-to-date software etc.

Also, I do not believe this game has english subtitles since it says JAP in the title. So it's probably a straight rip from japanese original CD.

Guess that's about it..."
