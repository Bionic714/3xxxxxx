,M33S3,2006-01-07T09:32Z,"Forgot to mention it but this uses StarForce protection, so unless theres a better method I haven't heard of yet, use Daemon tools 4 (the newest one) and either unplug or disable your physical cd and dvd drives to run. There are a bunch of other programs to get around it, but this works and is all I'm bothering with."

Tnx"
,DeusIrae,2006-01-07T12:01Z,"cool thanks been waiting for this a while. its an alcohol image file....looks good, should work with Dtools 4 and SFnightmare or just unplugging your IDE drives and dtools

,DeusIrae,2006-01-11T07:58Z,I think the image is a bad one.. incorectly burnt. It doesnt seem to work no matter what.
,Guba,2006-01-21T09:38Z,"having same trouble as every1 else. insert licensed disk! i've tried everything i know of starforce nightmare, star fuck, dtools 4, also disconnected my dvd drive. i can get other star force games to work fine just not this. 2nd time i've downloaded FC and still no luck :( i was hoping this torrent would be different as it Gold version but it's same as the normal FC disks. If any1 finds a solution plz post"
,Zack2k,2006-01-21T21:16Z,"Yeah, doesn't work here either. Same problem, stays stuck on protection screen for a minute then says insert licensed disk. Other starforce stuff works without problem, so this image for CD2 must be bad.

Don't bother seeding."
,tungxxx,2006-01-22T22:16Z,"Like the others, got a message: ""Please insert a licensed version of the disc"". I wonder if this is really an error. B'cause DT4 cannot emulate some new Protection systems.
to M33S3: pls try to install from those images to be sure that we are waiting time on downloading the disk 2 or not. If the image has error, can u make another one?"
,tungxxx,2006-01-22T22:33Z,"""Failed to identify the disk in drive...""  means that the image of CD2 has problem. M33S3, can u make another one and before putting it on TPB, make sure that it works. Thanks."
,Zack2k,2006-01-23T04:31Z,"Flaming Cliffs (CD2) uses an old CD-based version of starforce so it should easily be emulated with DT4. There has to be something wrong with the image of CD2 that's preventing it from working...
Any chance of making another image of CD2, M33S3? TIA"
,TheProphetD,2006-01-27T21:34Z,"I could install it (went to ""my computer"" opened the disc without autorun, clicked the ""install"" icon, istalled...) but I can't crack star force, I tried DT4 with all the emulation options on.
How do I crack it?"
,M33S3,2006-01-28T11:22Z,"For everyone having problems with this image, if you have tried SFCure, SFNightmare, StarFuck, etc. in addition to DT4, and have tried such programs as virtual cd hide or any other virtual drive masking program, and still cannot work the game, I have uploaded a redone image of just disk 2 (by the name of Lock On: Modern Air Combat Flaming Cliffs). If you still can't work the game with that, then you'll just have to wait for a better emulator or a cracked exe (either of which could take a long while). I am reasonably certain that there is no problem at all with this new image, and don't have time to test every image I make extensively. So, sorry for any inconvenience, but if you think you can do a better job then go out, buy the game, and make your own damn image."
,TheProphetD,2006-01-28T12:16Z,"Thank you a lot, I hope it will work.

,tungxxx,2006-01-30T16:33Z,"omfg, M33S3 doesnt want to help us anymore. M33S3, we beg you to make an image following Zack2k's instructions, we only need a MDS made w/  RMPS enabled, a tiny file that u can upload on a free host. Can u?"
,tungxxx,2006-01-30T16:34Z,this version wont work 'cause u didnt make it w/RMPS enabled. All we need is a working MDS (around 30KB).

Follow this 10 easy steps carefully. Use the linkz provided below.

1. Use StarFoce remover ""sfdrvrem.exe"" to remove any trace of StarForce (the CD protection used by this game).

2. Install Lock On v1.0

3. Run the update v1.02

4. Burn THIS TORRENT's CD image on a CD (CD-R or CD-RW) with Alcohol 120%. (YES, a CD!!)
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3436909/Lock_On__Modern_Air_Combat_Flaming_Cliffs

Write Method: DAO/SAO
Write Speed: 4X (600 KB/Sec) or less.
Leave all the other setting as default.

Alcohol120% 2.0.0.1331 trial will do it. ;)

5. Install ""Flaming Cliffs"" from the CD you just burned.

6. Install the patch 1.12b

7. Run ""Lock On.exe"". The protection system will ask to install additional stuff. Press YES.

8. Reboot

9. Install StarForce Update ""sfdrvup.exe"" (to enable weekly CD checks)

10. Disable any virtual drive and insert the Flaming Cliffs CD. Run ""Lock On.exe"" and Enjoy!!!


Remember, no need to insert the CD each time you run the game, just weekly. ;)

,mimorqleko,2010-03-18T15:24Z,"The success of passing the protection depends a lot in you CD/DVD reader.

* First try using a CD-RW, if it doesn't work then try burning a DVD-R, and so on, always using the minimum burning speed available.

* For those under windows 7 just follow the steps carefully and you won't have any trouble. ;)"
,DaNoob,2010-03-20T08:02Z,"What ever you do, do NOT USE A CD!!!

I am finding out that you need to burn it at slowest speed to a DVD R. There is a torrent on demonoid and everyone says it works 100% if you use a physical DVD R. Also you need to make sure the image is good.

IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO USE PHYSICAL MEDIA AND YOU HAVE XP OR VISTA CHECK OUT MY TORRENT! It works 100% and always passes the check using demon tools."
