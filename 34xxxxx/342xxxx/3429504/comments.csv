Is all truth this well concealed under layers of lies?"
,screwjack,2007-03-14T11:07Z,seeders? :/
,Apple_freak,2007-12-05T23:10Z,Very interesting story. They're trashing our rights.
,TeamAmerica,2008-11-25T04:17Z,"I've been a 2600 reader since the beginging and 2600 has taken a lot of risk and done us a great service producing this movie.

If you can afford it at all, please subscribe to the 2600 magazine and support them.  And no, I'm not in anyway connect to the magazine.  I'm just an old skool hacker who wants to preserve our freedom speech.

Apple Freak:  Yeah you are right except that they already trashed our rights.  There are no more rights except the superficial illusion of rights they keep up to fool everyone in to thinking they have rights.  But none really exist anymore.  Try to use some of them and see how far you really get.

Anyway happy as hell to see this torrent up.  Will seed as much as I can."
