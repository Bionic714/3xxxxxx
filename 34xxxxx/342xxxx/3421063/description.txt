A lecture by David Irving and Tony Martin about the trade in african slaves. Mr. Irving currently sits in a Austrian jail on the basis of thought crimes. Read about why here: http://www.rense.com/general69/zattk.htm

You may or may not like Irving's research, but I will continue to upload his lectures solely on the basis of his imprisonment on thought crimes. And that is the end of it. I stand up for the little guy and free speech, and the "little guy" is most DEFINETLY not an orwellian police state, ridled with thought-criminals and apathetic morons, who simply turn a blind eye to such incredible meassures. You will moste definetly get what you deserve if you do so. 

Feel free to whine about it, and leave your hysterical, malicious, hateful, filthy and abusive comments below if you would like (I know some would like that very much), but do not expect me to take them seriously, much less read them.
