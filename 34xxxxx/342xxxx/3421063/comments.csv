""I made a mistake when I said there were no gas chambers at Auschwitz,"" he told the court, referring to comments he made in Austria in 1989. ""I'm not an expert on the Holocaust"". In fact, the guy's not an expert on anything but paranoia, lies, racism and shit-stirring. Like the cunt that posted this torrent."

,sarsapil,2011-02-19T22:51Z,"Irving is a LIAR (see the judgeÂ´s ruling against him in the famous Irving vs. Lipstadt case), who as his personal diary showed, always hated jews and niggers...I am not a jew but I feel I must say this. Some people dislike jews because theyÂ´ve been brainwashed by the christian churches for centuries that they are the killers of jesus (big lie, the romans did it...), also the envy they cause because being a people without a country for ages they had to work hard and save and thus many of them were well to do, itÂ´s a sick attitude towards THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO DIDNÂ´T SUBMIT TO THE ROMANS, their oppression and repression, thatÂ´s why they were expelled from their land, for that they should be admired, not hated, but so is the worst aspect of human nature, despise the freedom lovers and admire the brainless nazis who submitted to the criminal bohemian corporal Schickelgruber (hitlerÂ´s REAL name), a bunch of spiteful losers all of them. Such liars that carefully hide the facts in national archives that many thousands jews fought and died for Germany, Austria, France, England, etc. in wars, even getting medals for bravery... The holocaust was the reward the nazis gave them..."
,quarefremeruntgentes,2011-05-25T04:44Z,"@sarsapil: I am not sure how much I might sympathize with David Irving's message, however, many of the facts do corroborate his criticisms of the public's distorted versions of WWII and Nazi atrocities...

Want proof?

Please tell me where I can, otherwise, find a museum for 120+ million gentile vicitms of communist persecution, paid for with public funds!!!???

As for Hollywood and the mainstream media, I would have to say they are even more culpable than the masses who have drunken their kool-aid.

,quarefremeruntgentes,2011-05-25T04:54Z,"@sarsapil: Notwithstanding your fuss about Irving's retraction about gas chambers, all historians make occasional mistakes and misinterpretations about the record of the past. For my part, I deplore the fmr. regime in Germany, however, to imprison academicians for making historical errors is more typical of the conduct of despotic police states, rather than a free and tolerant society.
