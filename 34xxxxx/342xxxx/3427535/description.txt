By request this one...George Lucas's first film.But be warned this is nothing like Star Wars!This is for die hard sci-fi fans only.IMO remarkable in that you would think this was made late 80's or early 90's instead of 1971.Very modern looking.It's got a bit of everything....Logan's Run...1984...Cube...Terminator...etc.

Subtitles: English,French,Italian,German,Spanish,Dutch,Arabic,Bulgarian,Romanian

Spoken:English only. I turned off French and Italian to save 700mb
