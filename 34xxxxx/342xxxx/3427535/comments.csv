,wolf359,2006-01-04T02:02Z,Didn't mean to give the impression it is inaccessable. Just meant it is proper thoughtful sci-fi rather than regular family type stuff.It's different but intriguing and....Yes GREAT stuff :)
,antiterrorstyrkan,2006-01-04T06:02Z,"its good. and Lucas made a first version as a schoolproject. so this one is a bigger budget remake. (so the whole revisionistic complaint most hav after StarWars is nothing new to him at all.. :)

,jebusau,2006-04-11T03:30Z,Can someone please seed? I've read many good things about this movie!
,franl,2006-06-24T22:04Z,Is this the Director's Cut or the original?
,danelectro,2006-06-29T20:32Z,"It must be the director's cut, I don't think the original version was ever released on DVD."
,bmz,2006-07-11T21:37Z,"how do I burn this? I tried cloneDVD, but it didn't work"
[T],FatFreddy475,2006-08-11T16:13Z,"I'm pretty sure it's the DVD version (directors cut). I loved the original, this one has too much cgi put into it and it's also cut a little different which I don't like. Still quality is awsome as are all of Lucas' dvd's... besides American Graffitti. If you love sci-fi this is a must, imho Lucas' best. "
,bignowhere,2008-03-06T11:53Z,"Hey Brother,

Would love to download The Quatermass Conclusion after I've done with Blakes 7 but, it will need a reseed I guess.  Can you please do that for me?"
,Buhbye,2008-05-05T17:22Z,Is this PAL or NTSC?
