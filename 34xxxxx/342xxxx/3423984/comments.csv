But a fucking MASSIVE thank you! Ive been looking for the cast soundtrack, importantly with Jamie Donnelly singing""Science Fiction/Double Feature"", as it was the first version i ever heard on LP, and this version of the Rocky Horror Show is the absolute best one available.

THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH!!"

,hornsfan2112,2009-08-04T00:17Z,I love people who bitch about getting free stuff. Go fuck yourself trannytrash. You definitely have an appropriate screen name.
,JBJosh,2010-12-31T00:50Z,"hornsfan2112, don't bitch so much. It looks bad. The torrent, while great, could have used work. Constructive criticism is not bitching, and it would be good for you to learn the definition.

Like has been said, it has no tags or anything, so that's gonna be some manual labor. It is still a great torrent though, because the quality of the files are nice and obviously Rocky Horror is awesome."
