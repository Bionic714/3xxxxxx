,viuh,2006-02-17T05:12Z,how can I see this? i donÂ´t know what to do
,Mr. X [NOR],2006-02-17T10:43Z,"There are two ways to watch it.
One way is to burn it to a dvd with a burning software like Nero, and play it on your stand alone dvd player.

Another way is to mount it with a virtual drive like ""Virtual CloneDrive"" or ""Daemon Tools"", to watch it on your PC. 

To play it on your PC you will need a DVD player software like ""PowerDVD"" or ""WinDVD""."
