Thank you so much for this UL! Thank you from me, my GF and my two little girls, we have had a blast with it!"
,Pornopartner,2006-01-15T15:56Z,"My pleasure Capt... We loved it too....

Look forward to some more songs...

Maybe with a more european mix, as a lot of the 'ROCK' ballads are very American and unknown in the UK."
,nicnic999,2006-02-11T16:48Z,deos it only work with origional xbox mic? the application works but i can't start the song (im on the screen to chose mic)
,Pornopartner,2006-02-13T15:00Z,"Have tested with Liver headset and Madcatz mic both worked fine.

Make sure mic is plugged into your controller then move keypad left or right, should work okay. "

,Pornopartner,2006-03-09T22:40Z,"Did you just burn the iso file to dvd, and at what speed burn at 2 speed I fibd the xbox drive does not like things burnt any faster.
Also remember you need to burn the iso to DVD as an image not just the file."

,CoachP,2006-05-05T06:15Z,"I got the game to DVD, ran it from DVD on my xbox no problems there. The only thing is now its reading as empty in my pc drive for some reason and i cannot put that folder into E/ TData unless the pc drive reads it correct?

,CoachP,2006-05-05T17:04Z,"Well i saved the game to the HD then went from there. I didnt notice anything different tho.... but the game works great and very fun, Ill keep mine open as well. If anyone gets some songs added please post."
,fuzzgun,2006-05-30T00:46Z,"I went to xbox.com and read this. I cuote ""This is the first Xbox karaoke game to feature a vocal analyzer that rates the pitch and rhythm of your performance"" Do you need to buy a special xbox mic or is it possible to plug in a regular mic through an adapter of some sort??! I got a usb adapter!?"
,fuzzgun,2006-05-30T00:50Z,By the way. I would appreciate if some one could seed please. Thank you
,peanutinky,2006-08-10T15:57Z,"it don't matter what speed you burn at. it what kind of dvd-rom you have in your xbox.

your computer will not read a xbox game disk anyway it will burn them but not read them.

thompson dvd-rom reads both dvd-r/+r 
samsaung read dvd-r and not dvd+r
philips will only read dvd-rs

and what brand of dvd are you using.
