Full Version, of Karaoke Revolution Party, including live Soong Pack.

Can be run from DVD.

When you first use it will create a save game file, reset Xbox,

Now go to E:TDATA and place the included folder 4b4e002e (On DVD) into it.

You should now have 4b4e002e00000015 and 4b4e002e00000016 added. I reccomend removing any others in the 4b4e002e folder.

The final step is to clear the cache on your drive. Those are the X: Y: Z: drives and the E:CACHE folder.

Start your game and KEEP YOUR SAVEGAME!!!!!

Have tested this and works...PROMISE !
