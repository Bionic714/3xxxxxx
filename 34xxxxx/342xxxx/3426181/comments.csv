,gasman364,2006-02-14T00:39Z,Don't both downloading- it's Japanese only through and through.  A total waste o' time.
,absinthe1,2006-05-11T02:06Z,How do you get the subs to work and/or the audio in english? There is no .srt files!
,Claydol,2006-08-08T23:39Z,How did you played this movie?
,Crying_Buddha,2006-11-15T18:00Z,"All I get is your happy jap intro.. I have vlc player, shouldn't it work?"
,kret0x,2007-02-02T02:29Z,"We recommend using the VLC media player for full funtionality of this
release. The download can be found at www.videolan.org.

Stop masturbating and read :|"
,[-Ritsuka-],2007-06-25T11:28Z,It says that the file name is too long and refuses to download it. How can this be fixed?
,Timeleft,2008-03-26T06:16Z,"Yea, because the only spoken language on this planet is English, eh? Dumbshit, go and learn to be culturally tolerant before you interact with people.

Also - Since you brought it up, and it's another opportunity for me to call you a dumbshit; learn to read the instructions. Clearly says English on it, figure out how to work it or STFU."
,vsx06,2009-06-07T09:53Z,"Thanks alot for this movie.
I'm happy to see excellent quality ;)
Btw: If u don't wanna use vlc than Gom + KLM CP  is also good player. Or MCP from KLM CP directly."

,tom1awesome,2010-01-01T23:29Z,"vlc says it cannot open the video file for the actual movie (the intro plays fine, though).  Any ideas?"
,TranscendentVirility,2012-01-22T17:01Z,Excellent quality.  I use SMPlayer to choose the language and subtitle tracks.  Thanks for uploading this great movie in its original language.
,bearykuma,2012-08-12T03:08Z,"I just downloaded this, and it does have both English & Japanese audio, as well as subs in both languages. 

What kret0x said, VLC is recommended. On VLC player, you can switch languages on the options Audio->Audio Track & Video->Subtitles Track.

So if you want, you can watch in Japanese with English subs, English with Japanese subs, or Japanese/English by itself.

It works just as said. :)"
