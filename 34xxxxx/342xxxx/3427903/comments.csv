,Tuska,2006-01-12T18:31Z,"So, what IS the spoken language? Just got the one that's Spanish, not feeling like getting another of those..."
,Tuska,2006-01-13T02:55Z,That would mean ALL of the central/southern Europeans are illiterate :D Thanks mate for the info
,wasted++,2006-02-22T21:07Z,"It wasn't easy to find working english subtitles for this, but they can be downloaded from www.subtitles.ro - just search for Serenity and specify that you have 1 CD. And thanks to Tyramead for this torrent upload!"
,raybrul,2006-03-10T10:23Z,"Oh my f*** god, the movie is in great quality, BUT the editors voice of commenting the film is on the soundtrack!! WHY didnt you write that info!? A little important dont you think!???

i registered here only because i had to say something.....man..."
,raybrul,2006-03-10T10:52Z,"okay..this is strange..and awkward.. in windows media player the directors voice is playing, but when i play the movie with jetaudio media player, everything is as it should be...

i appolagize for my last post, plz ignore it, even though Tyramead should mention this in his info.."
,Tyramead,2006-05-03T14:34Z,I didn't even know there was an editor's track. the source was from a two SVCD disc set which I divX merge and encoded. Are you sure there was an editor's sound track? The write up didn't mention about it at all. Now that's strange isn't it. Can you replicate playing the editor sound track again?
