Rome: Total Realism

A R:TW modification dedicated to just that. Greater realism. No matter which faction you choose, a greater historical feel and a greater historical accuracy is reflected throughout. Containing many, many individual changes, once you try it, you'll never go back.
All new units and historically accurate skins for existing ones.
All new provinces and settlements.
A reinvented economic model.
Factions renamed and redone to correctly fit the time period.
Accurate starting areas for all civilisations.
And much, much more. View the read me file for a more in depth list.
