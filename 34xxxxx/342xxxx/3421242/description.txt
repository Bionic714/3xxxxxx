ArcGIS Desktop is a collection of software products that runs          
      on standard desktop computers. It is used to create, import,           
      edit, query, map, analyze, and publish geographic information.         
      There are four products in the ArcGIS Desktop collection; each         
      adds a higher level of functionality.                                  
                                                                             
      All ArcGIS Desktop products share a common architecture, so            
      users working with any of these GIS desktops can share their           
      work with others. Maps, data, symbology, map layers,                   
      geoprocessing models, custom tools and interfaces, reports,            
      metadata, and so on, can be accessed interchangeably. This             
      means that all GIS users in an organization can benefit from           
      using a single, consistent user interface and set of                   
      functionality and data formats, thus minimizing the need to            
      learn and deploy several different products.
