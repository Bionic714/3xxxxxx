,computerkidt,2008-10-08T03:20Z,GREAT game it's an old Real-time strategy game tho some graphics cards aren't supported like mine so it crashes right after you try and load the 1st mission. I use a friends PC or switch my graphics cards when I want to play. I've been seeding this on&off for like a year cause its RARE and hard to find. 
,BigDaddyV1,2009-05-27T18:34Z,"ohh this is a good game thanks for the seeders 
i'll seed when i'm finish with downloading

,motley666,2010-12-31T19:17Z,"Thia game is abandonware now, you can search in sites and d/l it faster."
,Lovykar,2011-01-10T22:00Z,"I've got an average of between 500 and 600 kB/s, and am gonna be done downloading all of it in less than an hour. Faster online? Not if you count all the trouble of finding it, much less actually getting it down and then for it to work; I'm sticking to TBP for as far as I can foresee, at least ;) Thanks original uploader!! "
