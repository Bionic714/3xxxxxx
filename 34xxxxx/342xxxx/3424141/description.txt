S Sko (1998) 192kbps

Revelation
August to come
Someone to hold me tonight
Tears in my eyes
Whatever you do, (don't stop)
Do you care
Was it something I said
Secret in your smile
Into my world
I just wanted you to know
What you want


Shine (2000) 192kbps

Maybe we could make it
The man is a boy
Right here waiting
In your eyes
Whatever it takes
When you were nice
Fire & Water 
Jealous
One step only
Zip your files up
Simple loving
If you love her 

Again, SÃ¶ren Sko. He's got an amazing voice and I would very much like to get a hold of the rest of his albums, anybody? :)
