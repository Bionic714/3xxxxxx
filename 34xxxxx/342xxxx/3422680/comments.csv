Would you mind to seed? I have already over 50% and I would love to show this movie to my wife and son! Thanx a lot!"
,Chickpea,2008-10-10T15:54Z,Says language (spoken and texted) is English but there are no subtitles and it is spoken in French/German!! Where can I get English subs from pls?
,Rhum_Keeper,2009-02-07T12:19Z,go to www.allsubs.or and search . There are 2 english versions . O picked the second one. Look allright..
,lightman12,2010-11-29T20:31Z,"The subs are there! you have to watch it with DivXplayer - and select the english subs from there. btw: The movie is in 3 languages, german engish and french and the actors do speak the language they are supposed to speak, e.g. those playing germans speak german etc. very funny. I am lucky, I understand all three so I dont need the subs :-)"
