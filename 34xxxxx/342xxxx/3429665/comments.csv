All i get it is ""There is an Error in the application"" ""2123""  (BTW:  I had Rosetta installed w/ a different language before, I don't know if thats whats making the difference.)  "
,JHaxoR,2010-06-15T17:20Z,"People NEED to realise this is not the Portuguese language and the way is SHOULD be spoken, it is quite pathetic how people would rather learn this rubbish then the real spoken word. it is like saying i am going to learn irish English instead of the standard... Stop making the Portuguese language a joke with fake brazillian grammar and nonesense.... Remove this before the disease spreads any further.
