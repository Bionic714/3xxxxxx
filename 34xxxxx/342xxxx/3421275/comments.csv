,xcarobx,2006-01-12T20:29Z,"Anybody having success with this?
When burned it looks like a regular OSX-PPC on my Mac."
,Elros,2006-01-23T03:34Z,"This one really work!! How do I know this? Because I'm writing this in Safari running in Mac OS X running on my PC with an AMD Sempron 2500+

It's worth the download."
,Dark123,2006-01-26T21:00Z,"Anyone get this bootable, if so tell me how. :)"
,Elros,2006-01-26T21:59Z,"Just burn the iso-file to an empty DVD and it's bootable. When the meny appears just select the default options. 

Also remember to install to an empty harddrive. The minimum partition-size is 6GB.

The first thing you have to do is to create a partition. The difficult part is to find the diskpartition-tool when the GUI starts. It's in the finder-menu. It doesn't appear automatically.

When you have created a partition with the hfs+ filesystem, go ahead with the install-wizard.

I hope this was helpful  :-)"
,Dark123,2006-01-26T22:33Z,"Thanks, I cant boot up my Mac atm, so I have to burn it from Windows, I tried Nero."
,mail4asim,2006-01-28T14:13Z,"I was  able to install this version but when I boot my laptop Dell D600, it would come up with the error message saying I needed to restart my pc.  So I installed the tiger 10.4.1 generic install DVD and then used the 10.4.3 to upgrade. It worked !
10.4.1 did not recognize my sound card but the network card worked. 
After the upgrade, my network card is not recognized but my sound works... "
