The year 2001 television series adaptation from popular wuxia novels by Jin Yong (Louis Cha). There are several other adaptations (different years) but this is the best one in our opinion.

Seems like ep 1-10 had been released in English but there seems to be no news regarding 11+. Thus, we started with ep 11.

This is the first release of our work. We are just a group of people who love wuxia series and want to share this experience with everyone. (http://azalae.com/fansub) Please bear with us if there is any mistake.

P.S. If you noticed, we don't have any name yet. In our enthusiasm, we just forgot to decide on group names, and just start working.
