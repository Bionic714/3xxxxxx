,Hellizard,2006-03-05T22:16Z,"thanks man, but i though live after death had 17 tracks and not 12 :S"
,anyoneatall,2006-03-13T22:53Z,"The CD version of Live After Death has only 12 tracks, the vinyl has 17."
,RaptorX666,2006-04-02T12:39Z,"vad i helvete filerna ligger ju fan på 40 mb stk!
och går bara spela upp i VLC!

,newswatcher,2006-04-18T14:13Z,What RaptorX666?
,blasphemist,2006-04-27T15:52Z,"Let me translate:

""what the hell the files are 40 mb each!

and you can only play them with VLC!

for fuck sake!!!!

IT SUCKS!!!

devil knows what program you're using you goddamn germans""

That's pretty much it.. ;p But, is he telling the truth?"
,Dunpeal,2006-05-13T11:22Z,"http://flac.sourceforge.net/download.html

here is the flac codecs you need works with WMP & WinAmp "
,Dunpeal,2006-05-13T11:25Z,Sorry it does only work withg WniAmp
,chuma,2006-06-28T21:59Z,Thanks!! UP THE IRONS!! 
,Scag,2006-06-29T05:29Z,simple...just convert with any one of a doz flac to mp3 converters
,nago,2006-07-30T14:40Z,"If you convert FLAC to MP3 I will cry. Just get the codecs, it plays in nearly anything decent, winamp, foobar, wmp. It even has plugins for nero."
,Boijer91,2006-09-11T21:23Z,Ni som e riktiga maiden fans ska inte ladda ner denna torrent för ni ska köpa skivorna iställe och visa att ni respekterar bandet helt enkelt!!!
,Tickler,2006-09-20T21:46Z,"Are these albums ripped from the remastered cd editions? That would be awaome, there's a huge difference in sound quality from the original cd releases. "
,Ran4,2006-12-20T22:29Z,"Boijer91 - Dumma idiot, vill man att bandet ska få pengar så ska man donera pengar direkt till dem. Att ge mer än hälften av pengarna till affären och till skivbolagen för en bit tjugo år gammal teknik är IDIOTISKT.

Hur som helst, tack så mycket för FLAC! Hoppas verkligen vi får se mer FLAC här, speciellt diskografier."
,wpc8mry73q,2007-11-08T10:13Z,"Hi.

Thanks a lot for some very nice music in lossless quality! RaptorX666's comment made me laugh.. a lot. Doesn't know what FLAC is and ""blames"" it on the germans! Hahaha!!"
,whitespiralxyz,2008-01-19T18:20Z,"Or better yet, move to Linux. It has flac support by default in most distros. And Amarok... well, rocks."
,Terratari,2008-03-05T09:29Z,"The funny think is, that playing music in Mac OSX or Linux (ubuntu etc) sounds cool, but same in windows ads some unnice distortions - the sound gets more nerving.
So even if you by pass the builtin windows 48khz remixing, which sound even worse, you won´t get a relaxed decent sound.
So moving to Linux is a very got idea for music lovers.
(get a ubuntu live CD, - www.ubuntu.com - u can check it out without changing your system - flac is already included)
ps. non-oversampling rules."
,bongodaddy,2008-05-03T18:19Z,"It´s only idiots that only play their music on their computer - either that or they have damaged hearing.. convert flac to wav and you can burn a full quality cd to play on a good stereo system.
but then many of the mp3 generation (raptor) are so brainwashed that they are happy with less than cd quality.."
,mazca,2008-05-24T13:34Z,"Excellent, thanks a lot. Are the earlier albums from the remastered versions, though? Not much point in lossless encoding if they were ripped from the 80s releases. "
,redtheghost,2008-06-22T04:50Z,"Awesome torrent, thanks a lot. Now if somebody would seed enough so that the download would go faster than 5 kbps. -_-
This download is gonna take a long time "
,cavediver,2008-07-06T23:33Z,Are the files correctly tagged ?
,Balzary,2008-07-26T08:11Z,Thaks for FLAC!!!
,Siankovic,2008-09-12T01:42Z,"Having downloaded the lot - I've checked all the early albums. They are in fact the original recordings with full dynamics. No hard-limiting until ""Fear of the Dark"" fucking EXCELLENT!!!!"

""It´s only idiots that only play their music on their computer - either that or they have damaged hearing.. convert flac to wav and you can burn a full quality cd to play on a good stereo system.""

so you are saying all bands nowadays are idiots because they record their music on computers?"

if you know what you are doing with a computer it doesn't matter what OS you use, the software drivers and hardware do.

i use an ASIO driver with winamp. winamp decodes the music file (flac, mp3, etc.) and then puts it out directly to the sound card through ASIO to my rolland firewire sound card, where the digital to analog conversion takes place. windows has absolutely nothing to do with playing the music other then running winamp.

linux and OSX use ASIO to output to professional audio cards as well, so like i said the OS is irrelevant. however OSX and linux are somewhat easier from a laymans perspective as you are not required to go to such great lengths to prevent the OS from interferring with your music, as you must with windows."

oh yeah, and can your CD player play 24bit 192kHz files? oh no, thats right those don't exist, you are stuck with plain old 16bit 44.1kHz CDs.

my firewire rolland sound card hooked up to a pair of $1200 KRK studio monitors can though."
,hankypanky1961,2009-04-14T19:56Z,thanx a lot for this torrent 
,T-Ron,2009-10-08T19:46Z,Thanx
,codgecodge,2009-12-21T08:08Z,"Thankyou for the decent sound. FLAC is so much better than mp3.

UP THE IRONS \m/"
