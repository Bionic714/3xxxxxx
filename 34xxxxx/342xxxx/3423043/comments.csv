,kossa.n,2006-01-04T00:47Z,"Aha, fattar. Viste inte att det fanns något program i OSX som heter diskutil eller på svenska skivverktyg. Och för er som inte hittar det så ligger det i Program>Verktygsprogram>Skivverktyg. Så är det om man kommer från PC-världen :)"

,mark429,2006-01-18T19:47Z,"dbhbln wasn't kidding you MUST burn this with Apple's Disk Utility or you won't be able to boot from it.  I tried Toast first and it worked but you couldn't boot, I tried again with osx's built in Disc Utility and it worked great! Thanks dbhbln and tpb. Apple wanted me too pay 130$ +shipping to replace my disc on a $7000 system, screw that
As always TPB kicks ass, keep seeding until you have a 2.0 ratio people!!!"

,spiralgirl,2006-11-24T22:50Z,"Hi,

I'm trying to get OSX 10.4 installed on my old iMac G3 which has OS 9.2 on it now.  What I keep doing is downloading OSX 10.4 disks on my new PowerbookPC G4 and then burning them with disc utility and then inserting the disc in my old iMac G3 and the OSX install will never open.  Why is this happening?  I can't download it on my old G3 since I have OS 9.2 on it and it's not high enought to open pirate bay and download a torrent.

Help please?

,spiralgirl,2006-11-28T21:26Z,"Did you burn this in disc utility as is as an dmg.iso format?

Thanks,

I'm wanting to install this on a iMac G3.

,spiralgirl,2006-12-01T19:48Z,"Okay I'm begging for help here.  I've installed so many OSX10.4's and burned with Disk Utility and held down the C key while restarting the iMac G3.  I've been burning this on a PowerbookPCG4 and downloading it there also.

I thought for sure this install retail DVD would work finally.  I've spent three weeks trying to get this on my iMac G3 to no avail.

When I load the disk it will open and I go to hit the install OSX icon and it says OSX is not supported for this computer.  Please consult the documentation papers.  Well I've gone onto the Apple support site and my model is there as one that can have OSX installed on it.  So somebody tell me what I'm doing wrong.

I'll keep seeding this for awhile and maybe it will help someone else.  Really don't want to go buy this but I may have too since nothing is working."

,simplespud,2008-04-26T11:15Z,"Hey everyone,

I have downloaded 94.4% but everyone has stopped seeding - please can someone seed until I finish?"
,raecharkenzi,2008-05-28T06:35Z,"if you use macdrive 7 you can burn a mac cd/dvd and boot that way, and the G# does not support tiger!! however the G4 does. macdrive is great for pc users"
,stinkingshoe,2008-06-08T22:19Z,It looks like this is for PPC only
,EuriskoXP,2008-10-13T06:39Z,"i have a macbook pro a1226 with a broken OS, and i have no mac to burn a disc from. 
1) This version would work right?
2)Would DVD decrypter work? its never failed before..."
,danjonas,2009-01-31T14:57Z,This is what I've been looking for for ages - please please PLEASE SEED - thanks heaps : )
,big_daddy23,2010-01-06T07:38Z,"i found  a way to burn dmg on pc i know it will sounds crazy but you will need a program called ""cdburnerxp"" you can download it from download. once you install the program choose burn a iso file on the browsing tab select all files instead of iso then select the desired file like osx.dmg and burn it believe it or not it will boot from your dvd rom on ppc only press the ""alt option""key once you press power and it will ask you where you want to boot from DVD or HD"
,AnthraX2112,2012-02-04T01:39Z,"Works Perfect! It's installing now on my Power Mac G4 SawTooth
