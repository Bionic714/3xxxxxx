,arrowbo,2006-03-21T16:06Z,Thanks so much zaftra!!!  Let's all keep seeding these torrents to show appreciation.
,Grasshead,2006-05-11T03:40Z,Why are these in mp3 format and not .shn or flac? You stupid motherfucker!
,zaftra,2006-05-14T20:29Z,"Hey shithead, they are in mp3 cos that is how I got them. 

You want them in .shn or flac ? go look for them and stop bitching."

,danatkins,2007-12-05T00:02Z,"The rar I DL'd was corrupted.  I got volume 4 CDs 1 and 2 but no CD 3.  Volumes 5,6,7 missing due to corrupted rar.  I DL'd a second time in hopes that would correct it, no such luck.  FYI.

All other dick's picks rar I found through pirate bay were OK.  FYI.

Did anyone else have this issue?"
,Ssparrow,2008-01-30T10:35Z,"Yes, I am having the same problems.  Alas, I have no idea how to fix it, as it seems to be from the torrent."
,Gr8fulPirate,2008-03-10T00:27Z,"I downloaded this, but it's in my computer as 2.17G document. My iTunes won't play it, and I can't find any application to open it. Can anyone help?"
