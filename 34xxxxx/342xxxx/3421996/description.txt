Hi folks!

I decided to share this great game (Guilty Gear Isuka) with you, because so many of you (from #Nipponsei@irc.rizon.net)
asked to help them out and share it. I also played the #Reload GG game. It is better than this one. On the other hand - you
have many more possible combinations and the Robo-Ky-Labs XD. Check it out!

Game: Guilty Gear Isuka
Language: Japanese
Install language: Japanese
English Patch/-included: Don't know / no
Platform: PC
Genre: Fighting
OST: avaiable (1CD as far as I know)

As to the requirements: I think if Guilty Gear #Reload worked well - this one will too.

Got it from emule in a *.rar file.
Torrented by divStar :) have fun!
