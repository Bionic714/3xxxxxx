Mythic Blades is a visually breath-taking entertainment title which places the player in the role of Legendary Hero or Terrifying Monster during combat to determine the fate of the Olympus. Ares has challenged his father; if Ares wins, he will take over Zeus place and rule over the Olympus - but the battle does not take place there. Instead it will be fought between Man and Monster.
