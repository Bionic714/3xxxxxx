,netito,2006-01-13T02:09Z,"rikzter u have to compile in the UT interface, also all airline imports u have made must be imported again after the update.

BTW.. I  asume u have Ultimate Traffic, right ? in other words this is just a schedule update for a addon u should already have installed."
,zackmoe,2006-01-17T22:02Z,"i have justflight traffic, but now that I finally figured out this flight1 cracker, i'm wondering if i should switch to Ultimate Traffic. JustFlight gave me a lot of problems with planes clogging up airports and runways, forcing me to go around over and over. Also, they don't follow a schedule really, planes appear and all start moving together as soon as you start  up the sim. Is Ultimate Traffic more true to life?"
