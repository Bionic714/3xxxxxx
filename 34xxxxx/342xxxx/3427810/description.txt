Inclusive US major media coverage of Mrs. Patricia Santangelo's fight against the Recording Industry's alleged claims of downloading music illegally.  A win for her would be a blow to the RIAA and it's futile campaign in trying to change the zeitgeist(the spirit of the times).  Good luck Mrs. Santangelo!
