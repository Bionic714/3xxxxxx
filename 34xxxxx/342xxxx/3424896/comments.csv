,annoybot,2006-01-14T09:09Z,After downloading this you'll probably want to look into bypassing the DRM as described at http://gustaf.symbiandiaries.com/weblog/books/CNY-on-hard-drive.html
,Metonomy,2006-03-10T15:20Z,"cheradenine: Thanks for sharing this one! But if You (or someone else who has got 100%) would like to share it a little bit more, I'd be greatful. Me and a bunch of others are stuck at 99.5%. If I get 100% I'll take the seeding from there. Thanks again."
,Metonomy,2006-03-13T10:03Z,"Thanks! 100% downloaded now. Works perfectly fine. There is, by the way, no need for cumbersome bypassing of copy protection/DRM on this one. Just mount the disc on a virtual drive and install. Use Alcohol 120 to create virtual drives. Then right-click on the virtual drive and choose Mount image."
,dongai,2006-05-17T11:40Z,Stuck at 72.2%. Seed anyone?
,pswinny,2007-08-08T13:39Z,"Any chance of anyone to seed this very popular magazine DVD, please!!!!!!!!!"
,2nz6dckr7w103yp,2007-08-19T00:29Z,Stuck at 99.4%. Can someone seed just for a few minutes? The rest of us will carry on from there.
,Clawhead,2007-09-16T18:12Z,"(Seems to work fine even if you only get to 98,9. Mount with daemon tools and run it.)"
,aartim,2008-06-18T13:32Z,"was able to convert the .mdf file to .iso and mount. can't browse through the issues though. the .mds file- can't do anything with it. 
of course I am a mac user!"
,cjrhfn,2009-01-04T15:26Z,"Please, more speed!"
,cjrhfn,2009-01-04T15:27Z,"To cheradenine:
Thank you for the 1st Disc. What about others?"
,kons_shark,2011-02-11T17:14Z,"Cheradenine, can you please let us know where to get the Disc 2 of New Yorker Mag?"
,Branches,2011-05-21T22:30Z,"Hi, please please seed. I will be forever grateful!"
,sv504,2011-11-20T18:27Z,"FWIW, these are DJVU files (which, being bitmap images, are inferior to PDF)."
,jerrry94087,2012-04-22T06:26Z,"BEWARE!

These files are in the proprietary DjVu flavor, called ""secure djvu"".

Standard DjVu software won't open it, and you will have to run some executables that come with the disk. They might contain viruses or malware (!!!)

You won't be able to open these in Linux (!!!)."
