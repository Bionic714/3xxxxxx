,r4v3n,2006-01-03T11:22Z,comment not working? I got database error back.
,r4v3n,2006-01-03T11:23Z,Comment seems to work if you write less text. Quite annoying that your text is gone instead of more user friendly (max xxx characters) when you have been writing a longer text
,Xbox_Mast3r_Xbox,2006-01-04T02:47Z,no this isnt a fake ...  < not like that wouldnt bother uploading viruses ... feel safe to download it :-)
,Gorgmeister,2006-01-04T20:41Z,"P.S.
If you can read this comment, the character-limit is pretty high... i think! 
whatever...

If I understand what you're thinking, I think you're wrong. You see... there is no limit on how much you can write in a comment. I'm not sure, but I've seen comments longer than my dick, and i tell ya, it's pretty damn long. but really... If there is a limit, it's pretty high."
