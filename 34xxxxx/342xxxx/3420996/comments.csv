,lstgnfghtr,2008-03-19T23:04Z,"If any of you have the VFR copy of the San Francisco/Sacramento area in California (by the same folks), please consider loading it up...I'll be more than happy to leave it seeding forever.  I can't seem to find it anywhere, and my paid for copy was stolen (along with everything else in my car), so I am bummed out.  

All of their scenery is VERY good.  I am a real world private pilot as well as a US Air Force Flight Engineer (MC-130P)...I have been flying the Horizon scenery in FS9 since mid 2005, and I think it is great.  Looks pretty much like the real thing out here in California, and I fly taildraggers low and slow, so I am a good judge.  I'm sure the Netherlands will be of the same quality."
