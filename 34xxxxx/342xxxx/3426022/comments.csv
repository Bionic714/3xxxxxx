,Zephyr618,2008-06-03T21:07Z,I'm thinking USA cuz it just says NTSC
,Lucky13s,2009-02-27T09:58Z,"there is a program out there that lets you play it on your computer without the lag most emulators give, once you've burned it to a DVD. I think its called PSX or something (its been a while since I used it, google for it). I used it to play some other PS2 games that worked great, I'm gonna give this game a try n see how it works."
,Lucky13s,2009-02-27T10:37Z,"pcsx2 was its name, according to the compability list, this game is fully working. However You will need a top-notch PC to run games at 30fps."

,gravitysp,2012-06-01T02:44Z,"Thanks for posting and seeding.
IMHO FFXII had the best gameplay of all the FF's but FFX had the best plot.  I'm going to put this one up on my server for permanent seeding.  Works great in PCSX2.  Cheers!

Also, for anyone that has trouble getting ANY console emulator to work with ANY game it is very rarely the emulator or the game just need to find the right settings for your particular setup.  Google is your friend.  GAME ON!"
