,Disi0,2006-01-06T00:44Z,You're absolutely correct. This is Seiken Densetsu 3. And I'm glad you liked the upload. :)
,Ichi Killer,2006-01-06T00:51Z,"love it!:)
do u know about the first seiken densetsu? nes or was there one at all?"
,Disi0,2006-01-06T04:47Z,The first Seiken Densetsu was released on the original Game Boy in 1991 but in Europe and USA they called it Final Fantasy Adventure. Check this site for more info on all of the Mana-games: http://www.fantasyanime.com/mana
,Ichi Killer,2006-01-06T09:36Z,"wow thanks!
wasn´t there also a legend of mana to psone?
and the titlesong was in swedish:) might been mistaken. "
,Disi0,2006-01-18T16:20Z,"Yes, I think you're right, but I have never played it. It would be interesting to hear the title song since I'm from Sweden. I suspect that the lyrics probably is nonsense. :)"
,IceMaster,2006-03-11T01:27Z,This is misnamed.  It's actually Seiken Densetsu 3.
,Disi0,2006-04-08T16:31Z,"In Japan it's called Seiken Densetsu 3, but in Europe  it's the sequel to Secret of Mana hence the name Secret of Mana 2."
,botnc,2006-10-10T01:50Z,"Acctualy the swedish lyrcis are rather ok, if not a bit off key."
,botnc,2006-10-10T04:36Z,"to compliment my earlier comment about the song for Legend of mana that is indeed in swedish, here is a copy of text i found at gamingeye,  ""musiken till Legend of Mana, som faktiskt har en introlåt på svenska sjungen av Annika Ljungberg för er som har missat det, och som är skriven av just Yoko Shimomura."""
