I have it on vinyl, havenÂ´t seen it on CD so this is great!"
,aj66,2006-01-07T00:09Z,Thx..... Cool to hear them again...   :0)
,jack59,2006-01-07T20:06Z,"What's it namy of the movie, where these songs is written"
,micleg,2006-01-07T20:16Z,"Grison: from what I remember the LP has one more track at the end (in fact, the best track of the album if my memory serves me well, and it was not written by TD!)"

,micleg,2006-01-07T20:21Z,"Well, the name of the movie is ""Thief"" just as the album, but it was also called ""Violent Streets"" and in Sweden it was called ""Gatans lag""."
,jack59,2006-01-07T20:26Z,Thanks micleg. I'll try to find it..somewhere...
,EuroMartin,2006-01-07T23:39Z,Many thanks! :)
,micleg,2006-01-08T13:28Z,Any TD albums you people would like me to upload? I have most of them.
,micleg,2006-01-08T20:57Z,"I think ""Encore"" is one of their best older albums while ""Turn of the tides"" is the best among the more modern albums. I might upload those."
,gusarko,2008-05-30T18:48Z,THANKS A LOT!!! I'VE BEEN SEARCHING FOR THAT SOUNDTRACK EVER SINCE I HEARD IT! :)))
,manofhood,2009-01-29T22:55Z," I know this is the original soundtrack, but it is missing music from the movie. Do any of you know if there is an extended version anywhere?"
,atget,2009-07-07T20:22Z,"The music on the ""Thief"" album is actually reworkings of the themes used in the film. There were other tracks used, from other TD albums of the period, but not included on the album, with the exception of ""Igneous"", which is a reworking of the second part of ""Thru Metamorphic Rocks"", from the ""Force Majeure"" album.

The US issue of the album features a track ""Confrontation"" by Craig Safan, which was not released in any other markets. It was intended, by Director Michael Mann, to have a TD sound & feel, but doesn't, IMO, sit well with the TD music.

The 2004 re-issue on Wounded Bird records features ""Confrontation"", but omits ""Igneous"".

This issue is, again, IMO, only worth picking up as a download, or buying for the curiosity value."
