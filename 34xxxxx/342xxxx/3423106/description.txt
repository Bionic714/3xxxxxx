Metal Fatigue is a real-time strategy game that follows the story of three brothers caught up on opposite sides of a war over the riches of long dead alien civilization. Set in a fully 3D world with multiple camera angles, Metal Fatigue stands apart from the genre with its numerous innovations: giant, re-configurable Combots; 3-Level Play, artificial intelligence from award-winning game designer, Mark Baldwin; and a pre-build phase that gives the player a enough time to establish their base before being attacked.
