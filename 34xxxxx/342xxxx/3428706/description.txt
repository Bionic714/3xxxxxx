SORRY FOR THE SECOND UPLOAD BUT PLEASE DISREGARD IT!!  I ACCIDENTLY DELETED IT AND I CANT SEED, USE THIS ONE INSTEAD!!  Thanks

May I present my very first torrent at The Pirate Bay, The Three Stooges.  It has 30 total episodes in a total of 4 gigabites.  The quality is good but some may not be as good.  Only a couple of episodes are bad, others just good.  I got 10 episodes from here by another person at http://thepiratebay.org/details.php?id=3398000 .  I avoided the others because this had the most seeds.  I got the other 20 from Gnutella.  I didn't feel like the year was needed much so I excluded it.  Anyways, the episodes included are:


A Ducking They Did Go
A Pain in the Pullman
A Plumbing We Will Go
Back from the Front
Cash and Carry
Crime on Their Hands
Dizzy Pilots (Really Funny!!!)
False Alarms
Fuelin' Around
Half Shot Shooters
Hokus Pokus
How High is Up
I'm a Monkey's Uncle
Jerks of all Trades
Malice in the Palice
Men in Black
Mummies Dummies
Pardon my Scotch
Saved by the Belle
Shivering Sherlocks
Spooks!(Colored episode, plus you need 3D glasses for it to look good otherwise suit yourself)
The Ghost Talks
The Sitter-Downers
Three Dark horses
Vegabond Loafers (Like a remake of "A Plumbing We Will Go"  only with some changes and it has Shemp saying most things Curly did)
Violent is the Word for Curly
We Want our Mummy
Wee Wee Monsieur
Who Done It
You Nazty Spy


Hope you enjoy it, please comment here.  I need at least 25 seeds so we can share this excellent classic.  Please seed so we all have a share.  I'll be seeding for a week so.  If it doesn't finish in that week, email me at ndog5000@gmail.com and tell me.  Enjoy and have a happy laugh, nyuk nyuk nyuk
