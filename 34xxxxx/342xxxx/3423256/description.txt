Munich, Germany, 1923. Two years have passed since Edward Elric was dragged from 
his own world to ours, leaving behind his country, his friends and his younger brother,Alphonse. Stripped of his alchemical powers, he has been all this time researching rocketry together with Alphonse Heiderich, a young man with a lot of resemblances to his own brother, hoping to one day find a way back home. His efforts so far had proven fruitless, but when he hears that the Thule Society, an occultistic group strongly tied to the Nazi Party, discovered what could be a clue to the location of the legendary, mystical place called "Shambala", Edward`s hopes get renewed. Meanwhile, in his own world, Alphonse Elric ventures deeper into the mysteries of alchemy in search for a way to reunite with his older brother.
