,turuk,2006-01-16T00:38Z,"Yes, it has the same subttitle problems as the other TV-rip releases available here ... typos and completely missing subs in crucial parts. Anyone know where to download working subs for this?"

,rehzix84,2011-01-28T10:32Z,"hey guys! i just wanna be the first to congradulate you on figuring out the ""limit upload"" trick! This way you see you wont have to worry about slowing down ur mommie and daddies internet at all and u cant just get whatever you want from piratebay without worrying about trying trying to give ot it away to someone else!!! cause we all know that giving it back to someone else is just like giving a black guy head, its fucked up!  U guys must be the coolest in ur  junior high classroom, im SO SUPER jealous of u guyz!!!! let me know once you finish your learning disabilities class so i can insult you in a format you can somewhat understand!!! in the meantime PLEASE!!!!!! continue to download everything you can and limit ur upload speed cause ur just so fucking cool! u guys deserve it!"
