yes this has been released allready i just made it better! added more apps
saco[at]hush[dot]com

from here on is the original  stuff that i didnt do thanks   fun-Loaded/imploded
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Whats a nfo file?, its the little box with the i on it you find in torrents(all good torrents should have one)
To view them as they should be viewed install damn nfo viewer
To create your own install nfo creator(the clues in the name)
A new found interest of mine is artwork in nfo's to add artwork open AsciiPic and insert a jpeg to convert into text,right click the contents of the text file and copy into your nfo file.
ascii pic has a few handy tools, negative,zoom,monochrome etc just play around with your images its fun
Also included is Ascgen this has less features but gives a better quality picture and supports more filetypes,so if you have already got the dimensions and detail of your  image right, use this for a clearer text file.


What to include in your nfo file?, as much info as possible, game,music,movie app review, bitrate,ripper used,passwords,serials,etc
Its also handy to include any instructions need to run that file correctly
Lastly, you or your release group but not mountains of spam and links to spam sites this is classed as the big no no as far as nfo files are concerned.
These files are for information, not links to free ipods etc.



Remember these files can be of  great use and help to people and people DO remember where they got help from, they also remember where they
got bad advice from.



Enjoy!
(p.s if you are adding complex artwork,right at the top of your info you should type
"For best results view in full screen ", for a few samples click on the few i have made in the examples page)



Good Luck and have fun-Loaded/imploded
