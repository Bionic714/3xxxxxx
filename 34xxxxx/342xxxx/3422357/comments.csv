Anyone got any comments on them?"
,goblin_560,2007-12-13T01:58Z,The best part about this torrent is the trojan horse downloader bundled up nice and tight inside. You won't discover it until you unpack the file. Gay.
,tyleriam,2008-07-07T11:03Z,I'm not going to download until theres conformation on trojan. If you did add trojan then u r...(I would normally be adding a whole lota nasty words here but since thsi is public...) A REALLY MEAN PERSON. Please clean up all torrents that u upload.
,thtoneguy,2008-10-03T04:31Z,i'm not afraid of the trojan (my antivirus will pick it up) however i can't help but wonder if the program/s will work without the virus file
,empalaminondas,2008-12-04T13:43Z,"I don't know, why put all theses files in a .exe? And what about that message about ""compressed small files""... My avg at the date of 4/12/2008 don't pointed any virus or something, but I will not run that thing. peace"
,phassa,2009-01-28T06:02Z,There is no trojan in this torrent. It contains an excellent collection of incredibly useful D&D material - particularly DM Genie.
,bobbyjkl,2009-04-28T05:15Z,"You can open .EXE with winRAR or 7-zip. Now, which file is supposedly a trojan?"
,AAngelraf,2009-09-09T02:37Z,What edition are these sources for?

@Goblin560, Get a more ""download"" friendly a/v that won't throw false positives for every compression or crack.

No virus, just a clean self-extracting exec.  If you still don't trust it, get a UHA compatible archiver and unzip manually to find a rar file."
