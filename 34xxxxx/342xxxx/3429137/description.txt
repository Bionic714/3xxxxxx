[b]Description/Info:[/b]

Simply put, this is Victory Records showcasing all their newest releases for the 1998 year. Great marketing scheme, even if all of the material on here has been previously released -- defeating the purpose for all those who own every single album on this label. Of course, all the hardcore stars are included in this package, ala Earth Crisis, Bad Brains, Snapcase, Strife, Hatebreed and Warzone. But then there are the newbies like OS101, Skarhead, Out of Order and Thumb all who follow in that same vein of chugga-chugga, guitars and testosterone fueled vocals. And what's this? Two ska contributions from Catch 22 and Hi-Fi and The Roadburners? That's not very Victory now is it?
