Replay Radio is best described as a TiVo-like software system for recording Radio broadcasts. It's
a great way to ensure you don't miss your favorite shows, or to take your favorite stations with
you using an MP3 player, iPod or car CD.

Replay Radio 6.0 can capture a variety of radio programming, including:

Broadcast stations streamed over the internet. 
Podcasts. 
XM radio (via online or a hardware interface) 
Audio from an AM/FM radio or any external device attached to the mic or line-in input on your PC. 
Picking shows to record is easy with the Replay Radio Guide. Over 1000 shows and stations are
listed, with more being added every day.

To listen to your shows, Replay Radio makes MP3 files for playback on your PC or an MP3 player, or you can command Replay Radio to automatically burn an audio CD for playback on any CD Player.

Replay Radio is really simple to use!
