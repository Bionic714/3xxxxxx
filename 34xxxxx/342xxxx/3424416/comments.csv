,k3ik0,2006-01-09T07:11Z,"I'm getting error messages when attempting to play any of these files, can anyone else verify this, please? If not, any hints on what I can do to view them?"
,KOREA Nuclear,2006-01-10T03:21Z,"I'm having the same problem. We need help, as  the release doesn't come with any instructions."
,k3ik0,2006-01-10T20:52Z,"one possible solution: use VLC to view the files. I believe they've been encoded in a pretty non-standard way, as not even G-Spot is able to render the files, and show me a combination of codecs that will work. However, using VLC, I've been able to get some of them to play. I have yet to try every file, but I suspect I'll be able to play them all of them."
,unit01,2006-01-29T23:01Z,"If you're even remotely concerned about quality, don't download this. The episodes have been very poorly encoded. Overcompressed and not properly IVTC:ed/deinterlaced, resulting in tons and tons of both compression and interlacing artifacts.
In short: they look like shit."
,russin666,2006-02-23T17:07Z,"I don't think the quality is so poor at all. It's not the best but watchable. But the way they've been encoded makes me mad, i'm unable to burn them to dvd because no program can't read them expect vlc player. Does anybody know how to convert them? divx converter doesen't work."
,BlackBelt38,2006-03-02T07:12Z,"Mine works fine - but I also have downloaded a codec called Storm Codec and installed version 2.

And use media player classic, which I get from this one - I have found it cann play a lot of cartoons, which windows media player can't..."
,cots,2006-05-07T18:59Z,anybody succeeded in recoding this ... cant't burn it on dvd
,M0T0RH3D,2006-07-27T06:20Z,use Media Player Classic
,Kuukunen,2006-08-02T14:35Z,"This is how to play it: Rename the files to .mpg. Some programs like VLC apparently don't trust the file type and tries to guess it.

The long version: I think this just might be the worst ripping job I've seen. On top of the wrongly named files, they haven't been deinterlaced (meaning: there are nasty lines in some of the frames). Also it probably would've looked a lot better if it had been resized. But resizing isn't even needed because it's VERY possible to get a near DVD-quality of animation with that resolution and file size.

Message whoever ripped this: You have a lot to learn. But I'm not trying to bash you here, it was the only rip around, I downloaded it and I enjoyed it, (I'm not too picky) but try to do better next time."
,mogto,2006-10-21T12:32Z,"Agree 100% with unit01 and Kuukunen.  This might be the worst rip I have ever seen.  Download if you must see it, but you have been warned.

The only other one I have is an incomplete VHS-rip, on the other hand.  This is better than nothing.

M0T0RH3D: Thanks for upping.  Been trying to find a complete rip for ages..."
,xhizors,2008-02-11T06:36Z,The WORST rip ever. The quality is like stepping in a pile of dog shit and not being able to clean it off... it's too bad.
