,emperor_hoi,2006-01-08T22:58Z,"Is it just me or is there lots of errors on this copy? I can watch it with vlc, but still, regulary some colour dots pops up and messes up the sound for  half a second... Wait, I also got some new windows poping up, (Hardware YUV DirectX output) wich doesnt make any sense to me.

Grr, I'm watching it anyways, even if it makes me mad! "
,emperor_hoi,2006-01-09T00:40Z,"Changed to Windows mediaplayer and daemon, that worked with no errors... Good movie btw."

,maxigawa,2006-01-11T01:18Z,"NOBODY helped so i worked it out myself ..After un packing with winrar -you will get the cue file which doesnt work for me! and the bin file ..Mount the CUE file (image) from disk 1 with Daemon tools then from the folder produced ,drag the ""AVSEQ01.dat"" file (which is the film in "".avi"") to your desktop (copying will take 3 minutes or so ) Then rename it to disk 1 .Then repeat process for disk 2 .Then open up nero vision express and burn to dvd as usual !   Next time please could ""noodles ""make a cue file what actually works to save all this bother  ..but apart from that a good release thanks.Maxi"
,xxxmeup,2006-01-11T01:34Z,mount with deamon and then play with windows media player. great quality!! thanks!!
,Fredde_23,2006-01-12T18:33Z,Omg 4:3 format is if you have a widescreen tv you can do the pitcure bigger and longer. Like widescreener or you can convert it to widescreen but youre loosing 68 % of the pitcure. Thats why widescreen is bad
,cheapsexwhore37,2006-01-13T07:12Z,SEED please
[V],vla108,2006-01-14T02:15Z,"Great quality but the film sucks. 
I guess Americans will find the movie great. Its typical stereotype of war movie where the enemy doesn?t have a personality they just die and you are supposed to feel sorry for the young American models running whit guns. "
,KeyserSose,2006-01-14T15:03Z,I havent seen the film but just by watching the commercials im pretty sure that this is 2 hours of propaganda! USA USA USA USA So pathetic!! 
,PMHR,2006-01-14T16:41Z,"Thx. The Movie works wery good, Grafick are good and sound are good!! :) this movie is deffinitive something to download"
,p-master,2006-01-17T21:43Z,very nice movie
,Daveman,2006-01-18T14:55Z,"Read the book before you badmouth this as propaganda, its not glorifying the american army...more the contrary"

[V],just_greger,2006-01-26T17:46Z,"wtf.. funkar ju inte :( står att sample-filen inte kan öppnas... ""permission denied"" och nedladdningen stopppas. har provat med att inte ladda ner samplet men det hjälper ju inte... 98% klart, och det fattas en eller två procent på ett par .rar-filer så filmen funkar ju inte"
