,doxxa,2006-02-11T09:34Z,how do i convert/play this songs?
,achtagon,2006-04-08T20:46Z,search google for 'FLAC'. It's a plugin for winamp or else used to extract these to the original WAVs (no compression) to burn to cd
,zymod,2007-11-21T13:28Z,Excellent up. Thanks for this classic in FLAC. I love the lossless for some of these old jewels.
,muzikphan,2008-02-20T07:55Z,"""Why flacs?""
Because flac rules.
Compression without any quality loss.
You can download this and convert it to your favorite lossy format if you want, or you can burn a cd just like the original one, or you can do both and then delete your flac files if you wish to do so.
Flac is the way to go.
Such a great album shouldn't have to go through the quality loss that mp3 files go. 
Many, many thanks achtagon."
