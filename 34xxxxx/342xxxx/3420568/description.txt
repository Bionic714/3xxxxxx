"Even though this album sounds like swinging jazz and is composed with great respect for all the necessary components of that genre, this CD can also be easily listed as Classical (or Classical Jazz). I say this because the music on this album, as well as on "Longing", is almost entirely written (all piano and bass parts). When I say written, I mean after numerous improvisations until David felt he could not come up with better lines, and finally put them on paper to be recorded"
