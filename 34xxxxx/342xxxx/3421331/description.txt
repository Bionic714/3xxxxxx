While parents, schools, provinces and states across North America bicker about the democratic process of running public schools, forces are manipulating education from behind the scenes. Major international players are reshaping public education to suit their own self-serving agendas, without regard for the wants of parents and the welfare of their children. This video lecture documents how today's schools dumb down kids deliberately, making zombie-like people who don't ask any questions but just follow orders.

Charlotte Thomson Iserbyt - The Deliberate Dumbing Down of America

This is far more than a mere book. It is a massive encyclopedia of facts, names, dates, events, and quotes that prove beyond a doubt that the decline in U.S. educational standards is the result of a deliberate plan on the part of professional educators with access to government funding. The purpose of this plan is, not to educate children, but to psychologically condition them to become compliant members of society with neither desire nor ability to question the dictates of an all-powerful global government.

The author is a former school board member who was appointed as a Senior Policy Advisor to the U.S. Department of Education under the Reagan Administration. She was dismissed in 1982 when she objected to agreements with the Soviet Union for changing the course of American education away from traditional values and toward global collectivism. The incriminating documents ? plus hundreds more of a similar nature ? are the substance of this book. If you are looking for proof of this nefarious scheme, you have found it.
