,$kibaDa,2006-01-03T18:37Z,Sry about my dumbness... But does this work if I dont have real version from DoW??
,BibbityJibbity,2006-01-03T23:37Z,"Nope, Sorry.  You have to have the full version of the original Warhammer 40k - Dawn of War.  Luckily our good friends at ThePirateBay have many good version of it for you to choose from.  I fully recommend downloading it and if you like buying it.  I'm going out and buying it this weekend."
,waldo272,2006-01-05T00:06Z,hey since cd 1 didnt work can i just download the contents of cd2 or do i have to download both
,waldo272,2006-01-05T08:11Z,after u download it what program do u use to open it
,BibbityJibbity,2006-01-05T21:45Z,You'll mount or burn the image with a cd mounting tool such as Alcohol 120%.  I suggest that program because it has lots of features.
,metalmind,2006-01-06T15:19Z,"Thanks for the upload Bibbity, ill have to buy this when i get more money in m pocket. 
However, I seem to have trouble finding a CD-key. Does my original CD-key from DoW work with this also?
Thanks again."
,Asiac,2006-01-07T00:05Z,Having some trouble with this one even. It says the original disc cannot be found or authenticated. Any ideas on what this is?
,BibbityJibbity,2006-01-07T00:55Z,"Again, sorry.  I'm still getting used to this torrent uploading business.  I didn't realize there wasn't a no-cd patch or a keygen on the cd.  I will upload them asap and put the link in here."
,BibbityJibbity,2006-01-07T01:23Z,"http://thepiratebay.org/details.php?id=3428620

There the keygen and no-cd patch.  Thanks for waiting."
