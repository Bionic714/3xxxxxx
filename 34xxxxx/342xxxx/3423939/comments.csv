,yutsi,2009-05-02T19:53Z,yeesh this is a really disorganized torrent theres a bunch of files missing
,Zylexm,2009-06-09T23:07Z,"well i havent found a single problem with this download... works fine.. speed isnt too bad at 1.8mb/s 

install was pretty easy too... 

mrs_rooster when you open the file that ends in "".torrent"" make sure its opening with Utorrent... to do that Right click it and select ""Open with"" and Utorrent should be on that list.

or you can open Utorrent, Click Options > Preferences > General... then click ""associate with .torrent files""    hope this helps :)"
,Zylexm,2009-06-09T23:13Z,"collinsfam  Sonic Record Now is a program used to burn files to a CD/DVD

i think you might want to look for a program which will mount files with a ""Virtual Drive"" which acts like a normal CD/DVD drive, except it is purely virtual.
this allows you to ""Mount"" a file image of a CD/DVD...  these files are usually the files that end in "".iso  .daa .bin .cue .mdf .mds"" there are a few others aswell

such programs are Daemon Tools, MagicISO, PowerISO. to name but a few.

hope this helps :) "
,VaultecWarrior,2009-12-02T03:24Z,Seed please...
,ledamay,2010-05-03T18:47Z,"Mrs Roooster...  You need to HOLD THE ""ALT key"" down and hit the ""F4"" key at the same tme repeatedly a few times then it will install!!!!"
