,flamesong,2006-01-06T17:59Z,http://www.macromedia.com/software/dreamweaver - why not have a look at their website before making smartarse comments?!
,jonestowntea,2006-01-06T19:30Z,"""There was a problem detected with your application. Please reinstall this software to correct the problem.""
So what did I do wrong exactly?"
,alfnilsson,2006-01-06T22:12Z,The same message about problem detected happened for me. Please reseed it.
,tandori,2006-01-07T00:55Z,"haha. ok dreamweaver 8 it is.... anyway, I still think its too small. some datasheet info: ""650 MB available disk space"" maybe its just an upgrade...
maybe you know flamesong?"
,Doom Duck,2006-01-07T14:43Z,Just dl the trial from Macromedia. (~56MB) Then use the serials enclosed in this torrent.
,chalkman,2006-01-07T22:06Z,"Hi,

Appreciate the app, but will not start, I get the same message as below. Where is this trial file supposed to be?"
,Doom Duck,2006-01-08T00:40Z,"Don't be daft! --> www.macromedia.com --> dreamweaver-page --> link called ""Download a 30-day free trial ?"""
,tampabaytom,2006-01-08T01:30Z,"SAME PROBLEM:
""There was a problem detected with your application. Please reinstall this software to correct the problem.

Anyone have the installer??"
,Doom Duck,2006-01-08T11:16Z,"OK. I had the same error message. But I downloaded the free 30 day trial from Macromedia. Upon completing the install, the installer asks if you want to continue in demo mode or if you have a serial number. I just used one of the numbers in the text file (that came with the torrent). Result: Working complete DW8, no time limit."
,chihuahua,2006-01-09T12:05Z,"Hope u guys have done this????

Dreamweaver calls home so block it with Little Snitch.
If you have a firewall, close the connection to this IP: 207.88.221.230 (The Macromedia Serialization Server)"
,bigjohn433,2006-02-02T21:59Z,"Hi, I dont want to dl this whole thing to get the text file with the serial number.  Can someone please message that to me?  Thanx"
,Chimpanzee,2006-05-17T02:01Z,"As this website does not condone illegal activities, i must tell you that the following are not the serial numbers out of this torrent so don't trying them... Honest...

WPD700 - 58202 - 88194 - 29915
WPD800 - 57533 - 91832 - 61682
WPD800 - 50036 - 22132 - 61740"
,peaceplace,2006-06-03T23:39Z,"Hi shark_of_mirkwood error when trying to download, is this torrent file dead?"
,Nuwan CD,2006-08-11T06:46Z,"hi, that's why u need to download from original link
http://www.macromedia.com/software/dreamweaver 
cheers"
,his_voidness,2006-08-12T04:13Z,"Yah, so this torrent does not install. The demo from adobe installs and these serial numbers work. Don't bother downloading this, just use the serials. 

I am going to stop seeding this."
,Triasp,2007-03-12T08:44Z,"Download the Trial versions. I did it for Dreamweaver, put in a serial and Contribute and Fireworks automatically have FULL versions as well. No luck with PS CS2 though...yet! Please post more NEW SN's. Thanks and have fun!"
,lberk,2007-04-04T05:24Z,Trial version is no longer available at Adobe's site.  Any idea where else it can be gotten?
,kimberntson,2007-06-03T21:54Z,"Hi,

the errormessage is most probably because this version is not a Universal Binary, but only a PPC version. I dld a simliar torrent, perhaps this some time ago, and when trying on my Intel Macbook I got the mentioned errormessage. But when trying on my PPC Mini, it runs flawlessly.

Anyone agrees?"
,egoclon,2008-02-14T17:22Z,"Hi people!! need the serial for adobe dreamweaver cs3 from mac. could anyone post it...

,dancinga,2009-06-16T05:58Z,maybe i'm being dumb... but there are six boxes that allow up to four numbers and no letters. how are you supposed to enter the serial if it starts with WPD?
