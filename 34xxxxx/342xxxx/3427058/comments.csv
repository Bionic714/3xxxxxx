,JonaXiao,2006-01-29T11:55Z,"Here's how you can watch a subbed version without burning it to a DVD, it's simple.

First, you need nero, make a Movie DVD image with nero burning rom.
Then, you need PowerDVD, just mount that DVD image with Alcohol 120% then load it up with PowerDVD, in powerdvd you can select the subtitle option, there you will have the english subtitle

translation is much better than the broken one, but still a few missed spots and typo, but not too noticible.
Good work."
