,Bluesoul,2006-01-08T18:10Z,Nastka either doesn't have the necessary video & audio codecs (xvid) or has a strange sense for humour . I wouldn't even want to speculate about the third reason :)))

,hardpad,2007-02-06T13:29Z,"Any chance of some decent seeders for this please - got to 71% OK but the 2 remaining seeders [both utorrent 1.6 users] although connectable [for hours at a time] simply do not pass any data on..!! Am running 24\7. 

4 visible leechers are, for the most part, unconnectable..!!

Any help gratefully received - many thanks in advance..!!"
,Azilect,2007-08-17T18:01Z,Anyone able to seed please? I saw this film when I was a kid and thought highly of it - I also had a thing for Susannah York - yum ;-)

,Neo_aeoN,2011-07-17T00:08Z,"Strange to think out of everyone who will see this film, there are some people who have no other option than to wait for seeders. Thankyou for those that do - film of this calibre needs to be available to the new eyes that may one day be *film* auteurs themselves. Keep it alive. Thanks Juan."
