,koei,2008-11-19T01:41Z,nice work just 1 small but very annoying and stupid thing why did you use fucking shitty 7-zip lol nub its not compatible with most of good emulators like fusion which is the only one that palys the 32x games properly but thx good work apart rom that just spent 30 mins converting all to zip again !!!!
,koei,2008-11-19T01:43Z,oh and another thing for all the other commenters if they in zips !!! no need to extract them to play all the emulators i found work great with zipped files :) but not with 7-zip files !!!
,Jessica3030150,2008-12-07T11:20Z,"Can someone help me? i've downloaded both fusion and gens to play the games but it only plays a blank screen, what am i doing wrong?"
