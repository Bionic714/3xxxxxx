,businessman332211,2007-09-29T01:47Z,"yes, they are sega games."
,a_guy823,2008-06-30T07:49Z,"your fucking morons, , sega master system IS the genesis, god damn it, one was released in i think europe, and the genesis is here,"
,MattLee,2008-07-20T04:54Z,"ok enough stupid statements.

1) the guy said sega emulator not just genesis

2) sega genesis and sega master systems are dif

sega master system was released with NES. just like sega genesis was released with SNES.

please people dont argue if u have no clue what your talking about, the title is sega emulator not sega genesis emulator."
,MattLee,2008-07-20T04:57Z,"and yes the comment below might say emulator for genesis but the title doesnt state that. so i dont know where u all assumed before coming here it was just for genesis.

he prolly is as dumb as the rest of you who think sega genesis and sega master system are the same system or that one is a euro release and the other a usa release."
,ThomasCallan,2008-07-25T18:27Z,a guy you fucking wanker. sega genesis is the american name for the sega mega drive

much appreciated"
,ufee,2009-03-29T07:26Z,"Old, I know, but for any future idiots who may come across this, sometime far into the future:

1) Sega Master System = 8-bit.
2) Sega Genesis = Sega Mega Drive = 16-bit.
3) Sega Master System != Sega Genesis
4) Sega Master System != Sega Mega Drive
5) Don't confuse yourself.

And for ""stupid nubs"" who can't figure anything out:

1) Download an emulator.
2) Download a rom
3) Open the rom from within the emulator
4) Play the game
5) Stop asking such redundant questions"
,loadedmaggot,2009-07-16T09:27Z,Well said ufee lol
