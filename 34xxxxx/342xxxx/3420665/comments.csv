If you want to talk real holocaust , there other events in history that make  WWII holocaust pale by comparison! Funny that no one goes to jail for talking about them.
All Hail the thought police! George Orwell must be laughing at us from the other side."
,vampire_pirate,2006-02-20T18:03Z,"IGNORE THE LYING CUNT THAT POSTED THIS TORRENT. David Irving did NOT go down for ""thought crimes"". He went down for LYING and SPREADING RACISM AND DISINFORMATION. How is that ""thought crime""? It's only a thought if it stays in your head. When you're making a career - that's right, earning CASH - peddling lies and hate, you deserve to be punished. Personally I think the cunt got off lightly.

That's a CRIME over here in Europe. If you meet a revisionist on the road, kick the cunt's head in."
,vampire_pirate,2006-02-20T18:05Z,"""I made a mistake when I said there were no gas chambers at Auschwitz,"" he told the court, referring to comments he made in Austria in 1989.

But he insisted: ""In no way did I deny the killings of millions of people by the Nazis."" 

""I'm not an expert on the Holocaust.""

,orillia,2006-02-25T15:43Z,"According to ashamed austrian's logic,  the ""thought police"" should back off virtual paedofiles too.
After all, all they do is promote something they believe in to likeminded individuals, exercising their rights in freedom of expression, no harm done..."
,horseshoos,2006-02-28T10:19Z,"orillia. you have got to be kidding. First learn how to spell - Pedophilia! How can you compare that to discussions on issues related to historic events being against the law? Who's the sick one. Again, I see the way you  want to win your argument is by name-calling... because you simply don't have any logical thought processes."

,sarsapil,2011-02-19T22:52Z,"Irving is a LIAR (see the judgeÂ´s ruling against him in the famous Irving vs. Lipstadt case), who as his personal diary showed, always hated jews and niggers...I am not a jew but I feel I must say this. Some people dislike jews because theyÂ´ve been brainwashed by the christian churches for centuries that they are the killers of jesus (big lie, the romans did it...), also the envy they cause because being a people without a country for ages they had to work hard and save and thus many of them were well to do, itÂ´s a sick attitude towards THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO DIDNÂ´T SUBMIT TO THE ROMANS, their oppression and repression, thatÂ´s why they were expelled from their land, for that they should be admired, not hated, but so is the worst aspect of human nature, despise the freedom lovers and admire the brainless nazis who submitted to the criminal bohemian corporal Schickelgruber (hitlerÂ´s REAL name), a bunch of spiteful losers all of them. Such liars that carefully hide the facts in national archives that many thousands jews fought and died for Germany, Austria, France, England, etc. in wars, even getting medals for bravery... The holocaust was the reward the nazis gave them..."
,hawaiianhaole,2012-08-01T23:29Z,"David Irving is a great man.
'holocaust denial (holocaust truth telling) is a crime because it never happened. If there really was a holocaust laws wouldn't be needed to prevent free speech and to perpetuate the Zionist/Communist lies."
