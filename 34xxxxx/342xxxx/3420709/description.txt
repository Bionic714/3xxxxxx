The utterly unique album by Peter Baumann (who's been a member in the group Tangerine Dream) "Romance 76" ripped to MP3. I don't think this album is available at all anymore. 

I got it on DAT many years ago and it was recorded at LP (long play) so the DAT recording is 32 kHz / 8 bits non-linear, but the music is not that demanding so I think the sound quality is very good. Upsampled to 44.1 kHz and then MP3 coded at 256 kbit/s by Sony Sound Forge 8.

I will try to upload his "Trans Harmonic Nights" too if I have success with this, my first torrent upload.

I want more people to enjoy his music and this seems to be the only way to spread his wisdom. No one sells his albums.
