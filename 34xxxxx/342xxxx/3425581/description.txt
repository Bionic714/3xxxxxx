APPLICATION INSTALL_________________________________________________________
   Edit XBMCxboxmediacenter.xml to your liking.
   Transfer _whole_ XBMC folder to your APPS folder.


DASHBOARD INSTALL___________________________________________________________
   Thanks to a new app called 'Team UIX's Xbe Shortcut Maker v1.0' by JbOnE, it's now extremely easy...
   Edit XBMCxboxmediacenter.xml to your liking & transfer contents of XBMC folder TO 
   (this is VERY important) "E:APPSXBMC". Rename <<RENAME_ME.xbe>> to something your bios can boot 
   (see http://manual.xboxmediacenter.de/wakka.php?wakka=XBMCAsDash#h44-2 or read your BIOS README) 
   and transfer to your C partition. No need to fiddle with HOME tag anymore, and future upgrades you won't 
   need to worry about this file on C.


TWEAKS BY T3CH______________________________________________________________
   I've cleaned up the scripts menu, >>XBMCskinProject Mayhem IIIpaldialogsubmenu.xml<< 
   (used for all resolutions) to only show the included QuickTimeBrowser & "XBMCScripts" scripts.
   If you add scripts yourself, this is the file to edit or replace.
