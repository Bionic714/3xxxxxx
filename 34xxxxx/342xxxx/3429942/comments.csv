poser just hangs................another waste of time!"
,marko76,2006-01-14T01:27Z,"I 've installed it on two Macs without a problem...
Maybe you did the SR2 update before launching Poser once to enter the SN. Try to install Poser 6, launch it, enter the SN, and, only after that, update to 6sr2."
,scunky,2006-01-14T10:37Z,"I installed poser then entered the S/r
I did not install the service realease update
I am running a Dual 2ghz G5 so it can't be 
a system problem..........any ideas??"
,scunky,2006-01-14T10:46Z,"for some unknown reason  this morning clicked on the poser icon and 
BINGO!! it runs.......wierd

I take it all back ...Great realease..thank you dude!"
,marko76,2006-01-14T17:46Z,You're welcome. Glad to hear it worked.
,marko76,2006-01-14T17:47Z,Now install the SR2 update. It fixes a lot of bugs.
,nexus168,2006-04-19T09:59Z,Please help me how to download?
,meowcarrot,2006-04-22T13:16Z,Doesn't seem to want to start up after running the installer. Any ideas?
,meowcarrot,2006-04-22T13:24Z,Nevermind. It didn't seem to like the name of my hard disk.

,katiaolive,2006-08-24T04:00Z,"Can we get a seeder, please? Thanks!"

one question. What does the service release do?
will it automatically update poser 6 to poser 7 when poser 7 comes out?
please someone let me know :]"
,Dap3192,2007-04-11T16:27Z,"Thank You, Thank you, Thank you!"
,PrehensileTail,2007-12-12T21:33Z,"I installed the program as well as the update, but it crashes constantly. I'm on os 10.4.11. Any ideas?"
,fuglar51,2008-11-27T14:33Z,"I'm running 10.4.11 and the program seems to work fine for me.  Try using the instructions by marko.

I realize there are few seeders for this, so I'm going to keep in on my list for awhile for anyone who'd like to download.  I never could get the 7 crack/sn to work, so my fall back was this, and it worked, so maybe others can benefit as well."
,freestylin9,2009-04-10T21:22Z,Thanks a lot!
,jlanebold,2009-12-07T04:32Z,im having problems opening the rtf with the SN can anyone just post it on here for me?
