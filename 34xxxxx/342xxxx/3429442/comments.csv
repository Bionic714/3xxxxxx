,arachnid,2006-05-01T07:10Z,"I got past the ""brush.tga"" error by copying the cd1's cue and bin file into a different folder and renaming them rld-rtwb.cue and .bin

(same as the cd 2 but the file is on cd1 )
remember that you have to change the line inside the cue file with notepad or something, so it reads rld-rtwb instead of rld-rtwa.

Next try to mount the real cd2 and the altered one in a second drive and hit retry a couple of times..

Hope it solves it for you who didnt know"

,iamholland,2006-05-26T03:31Z,To anyone having problems with the mounting etc. I suggest using Alcohol 120%. I like it much better than Daemon tools. It's easy to find on piratebay and it's good to have since many files are mdf/mds. I haven't had any problems with mounting this game.

,Smyth1,2007-02-06T16:20Z,"For anyone having the 'Missing file error' for any file just follow these instructions. repeat for each cd.

1) Create folder on desktop.(name it anything you want)
2)Mount the cd with 'deamon tool'.
3)Open my computer, right click the mounted image, click explore and copy and paste all the files to the folder created on desktop.
4)repeat for all cd's (p.s when it says already 'setup' file click no so it dosent overwrite it.
5) when copied all 3 cd's to the folder, open the folder and click on setup and it will install succesfully as the cd's where mixed up. 

People with insert CD1 error
1) search google for 'Rome total war No CD patch'
2) Once you have it go to Your rome total war location such as C:/program files/Activision/Rometotalwar.
3) once in there replace the .exe file with the .exe files you downloaded and it will now work without any cd's.  (ps you may need to download winrar too so google it if you dont have it).

Hope this info helps."

,LedZep123,2009-06-13T18:09Z,"OK.... Here it goes FOR ALL NOOBS!!!!

1. Download- uTorrent
2. Download- PowerISO 
3. Download this torrrent into a file
4. Go to uTorrent> Ctrl + O
5. The file should download can take minutes, hours, days
6. Mount the file into PowerISO!!!! You can do this 2 ways one is if you have the power ISO icon on the desktop taskbar (it looks like a cd.) Right click it and go to a drive (doesnt matter which) and mount the image CD1 rld-rtwa (make sure its the first one) Then click the setup launcher its has a grey icon. It should work.
7. It is going to ask you to put in the second CD this time leave the first one mounted but also mount the second CD: CD2 rld-rtwb (make sure its the first one.

Now, BEFORE ANYTHING read this:

There is something screwed up in the setup. After you mount the second CD there seems to be a problem in damaged or lost files. It says something like: ""Cannnot finf C:\.........."" and thens asks "" abort, retry, ignore"" now I dont know what to do can someone please help the setup runs fine its just somethings are missing! Can someone fixs this?"
