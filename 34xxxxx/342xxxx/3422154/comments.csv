,colonelmustardgas,2007-12-10T03:55Z,Could someone seed please. I'm at 97%.
,Pmack,2008-08-02T20:12Z,"Seeders? Stuck at 97.7% Stats say no one is seeding or leeching, but there are currently 6 people leeching, all stuck at 97.7."
,Zeph001,2008-08-08T03:32Z,Seed please!
,Pmack,2008-10-28T03:28Z,Can someone pop in and finish seeding this? I've been stuck at 98.3% for a few months now. I don't know what's up with the stats (which says 0 seeds / 0 leeches) but there have been many people hanging around and we're all stuck at 98.3%.
,jollyjim3939,2008-12-09T09:40Z,"Yeah, I'm stuck too at 98.3%. Sheesh."
,hasdrubal,2009-01-31T20:07Z,"Please seed. I'm stuck at 98.3% for some time.
I will seed this for a long time if I get a finished copy."
,hasdrubal,2009-02-24T00:08Z,"I found a complete copy and I posted it here: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4738727/Harlan_Ellison_-_Voice_From_The_Edge__The_-_Vol_1

When you start downloading don't start all over again but just delete the incomplete files and dirict my torrnt to that file.
If all goes well you will save some time downloading.

Keep this beauty alive and please seed with me."
