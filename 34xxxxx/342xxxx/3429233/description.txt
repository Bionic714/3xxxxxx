Here is the cracker (I'm not sure what version it is) that works on 99% of Flight1's products. Just go to www.flight1.com, download the product that you wish to "purchase" (Note "..." signifies sarcasm ;)) - place it in the cracker directory and follow the instructions included with the cracker. (Install.txt + Instball.txt and readme.txt)

(To use, extract the RAR into a folder of your choice and place the file you want to crack into the folder, open the CMD.exe file and type:

de-flight1.exe nameofthefileyouwanttocrack.exe [b]

(if [b] doesn't work, use -u- - it will give you an error message with -u-, but it DOES work, if neither of them work.. complain to Flight1 lol)


(Now incudes .key files for the following products - Go to the flight1 website, download the product and click "reinstall":)
