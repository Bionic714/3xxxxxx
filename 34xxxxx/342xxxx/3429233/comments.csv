,zipperflyer,2006-01-09T01:45Z,Intrested in the Dreamfleet 727 V2 too! Had a old wrapper that the cracker wrapper supported but still FS9 shut down when I selected the aircraft.........
,BlackBug,2006-01-09T07:03Z,"Hey Backifran, thanx for the effort of putting up the torrent again  :)  This is, although, a slightly older version of the flight1 cracker wrapper. "
,BlackBug,2006-01-09T07:09Z,"Ahoy Pirates, which version of the flight1 loader works with ""Flight 1 FS Beacons"" ?

I have used all loaders, and they crash. Any news on this one ?

Still requesting Abacus EZ Scenery....... "
,BlackBug,2006-01-09T07:27Z,"Has anybody heard of / is using ""FlyBy 2.0"". It replaces the 'tower view' in FS, and provides some very interesting views [which I think are not available even in Active Camera or Walk & Follow""]. I have tried and have been unable to find a crack for it. Hopefully, some of the pirates at TPB could have a solution. Just in case you have not used it, it is available at AVSIM."
,pilot013,2006-01-09T11:56Z,Yes I have crack it..it`s not difficult!Just use the FLight1 cracker wrapper v 3.03+1...I made some changes..and now just download the EXE file from Flight1 and tun it!;)

,bushbear,2006-01-10T23:44Z,"Hey pilot013, Please give us more detail. Do we go in the Internet to install? or not? (disconnected)? Install or Re-Install?"
,bushbear,2006-01-10T23:52Z,"..and a ""flight1_loader37 Message"" that says ""Wrapped detected but i has an UNSUPPORTED ver number. Patching failed! "" - i hope this helps us all. All day trying....no more after this. THNX,,,"
,bushbear,2006-01-10T23:54Z,"I'm trying to install the 727-2 from Flight1 but it just won't go! I try using the wrapper 3.3 and 3.7 and Renstall using both. No Internet connection. But all i get is an ""Invalid Data! This error most likely...."" error message right after the keyfile (fake) is generated. Help?"
,experimental_pilot,2006-01-13T02:30Z,Does this cracker wrapper work with the Carenado Stationair and Aeroworx B200?
