Notes: At the end jam Jello is on drums for a small bit of it. Mixed a little bad but oh well. Dropout during Night Of The Living Rednecks for a few seconds and two breaks during I Kill Children.

:extra notes:
Extracted the FLAC's back to WAV and slowed them all down by 5% using Wavelab 5 then encoded them to SHN using TLH
The original FLAC files ran to 59 minutes exactly, these new SHN files run to 61 minutes and 57 seconds
