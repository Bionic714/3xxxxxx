[T],sickboy88,2006-01-09T20:26Z,"4300 downloads, and no complaints.  Must be something you're doing. lol"
,biggerthanjesus,2006-01-13T05:29Z,"I've got the original australian release video (zombie broom fucking included), runtime is 100 mins. anybody know if it is completely uncut? Guess i'll just download it and find out."
,Kalibrowy,2006-01-13T18:04Z,"Hey! I'm going to download this torrent, but first can you tell me:

1. Why has this rip over 1000mb in one file?
2. ""Runtime: 01:39:24"", but Blood Edition has 107 min (http://www.cyber-pirates.org/index.php?sid=f252c9f7d78a73af9c2f88346412d704&cl=details&cnid=&anid=1263eb02fae604537.64257478). Is it that version for sure?

Cheers!"
[T],sickboy88,2006-01-14T00:54Z,"I don't know why it says 107 min.  It's not.  And I bought my copy from cyber-pirates.  Here are the scans from the torrent:

This is one of my FAVORATE sites. This site compares every difference of every release of a movie that comes out on DVD. The link I posted here will take you directly to the page with Braindead AKA Dead Alive."

,T.F.Bundy,2006-07-17T17:26Z,"""t is sad that we have to have someone from Australia show us how it could be done...""
""I've got the original australian release video (zombie broom fucking included)....""
The movie was made and 1st released in NZ not fucking Australia...."
,z0diac,2006-08-05T00:58Z,I have the unrated version of Dead Alive on VHS.. is this one a little different? I'm too lazy to dig the video out of my closet to compare runtimes.  
,Kexbandit,2006-08-14T11:34Z,LADDA INTE NER DENNA om det är tänkt för er att se med svensk undertext.
,mullhippiar,2006-08-23T16:37Z,"Joo Skit i undertexten, Detta är världens bästa film ju!  Har sett den tretton gånger, kan inte få nog. Men den är inte lika Grötigt våldsam som Bad Taste, den är också att rekomendera :)"
