,Happy Camper,2006-05-13T02:02Z,"Dude, Once I get in game, keyboard and mouse stop responding.  Ctrl Alt Delete still works, so its something with the game.  

Probably something with my computer.  Oh well.  Hope it works for you."

From the NFO-file: ""Release Note: While testing the game we encountered a bug on some computers. This bug is present in the final retail product that was shipped to stores. The developers ""fix"" for this problem is not to use the mouse in the menu."""
