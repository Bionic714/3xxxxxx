,sem_inspiracao,2006-07-31T14:11Z,"Bulls_Eye, this isn´t working, really, I downloaded both the game and gamedata, unziped it at the same game directory and run the startup.bat. It didn´t work. There are odd references at the startup.bat to some  files that does not exists (mp3unpak.exe and replwavs.exe). Does any one manage to make this game to work?"
