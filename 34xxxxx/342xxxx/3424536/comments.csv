,pezed,2011-02-24T04:32Z,"Thank You weaponofchoice. How long should a person seed? @NeoWitch I downloaded k-lite first then I downloaded VLC. I'm not sure if that makes a difference. I was able to watch and burn this to a DVD  with windows movie maker. I'm not even sure that I even need k-lite with VLC. I am using windows vista.
Can anyone tell me which audio and video files are best when downloading a movie?"
