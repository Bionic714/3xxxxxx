* I have included the mp3s of singles, EPs, and compilations only when they differ from the "official" versions found on other albums.  ** I made an exception with the "I'd Rather Be Flag Burning" EP because it sounds to me like Propagandhi remixed it slightly on "Where Quantity is Job #1".

Additional Information and/or Comments:

This is nearly of all songs released by Propagandhi from 1993-2001.  Many of these releases are long out of print.  Please support the band by purchasing the albums that are still being sold.  Thank you.
