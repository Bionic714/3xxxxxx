,Night--Lord,2007-05-08T23:51Z,games are all java so you have to send them with object push service... after that L6 will ask you if you want to install java apli..

,D77,2007-09-24T07:55Z,"This is version 4.0.3b 11-5-2005
You can easily update via liveupdate to
4.0.4b 12-1-2005 9.15MB and then
4.21a 14.26MB
4.36 17.74 MB
4.51c 3/20/2007 20.65MB
but then it ends there for me. Liveupdate says that it has newest version, despite the fact that (as of writing this post) there is 4.56a 8/17/2007 12.09MB. See below.
Therefore I recommend downloading torrent version 4.51c which is only 299MB compared to 543MB of this release. Plus you save additional 60MB in updates to get to the same version. It supports more languages than 4.0.3b right away and successfully updates to 4.56a for latest phones support. Simply makes this torrent outdated.
