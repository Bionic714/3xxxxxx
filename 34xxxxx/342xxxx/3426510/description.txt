   Any feedback would be cool, as this is my first attempt at ripping streaming media and also my first torrent. :) Hope everyone enjoys. 
        
        My upload is only 128 so the first downloader might take a bit of patience. Would be awesome if people with good uploads can stick around to seed. Thank you
