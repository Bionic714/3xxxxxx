,aeden88,2012-09-07T03:31Z,I've been getting burnt out on my current games so was looking for some of the originals that got me hooked. THANKS SO MUCH for this!!! This game and shining force series for sega genisis made me into the rpg gamer i am today. epic games. google the emulator if u dont have it as these games are such great classics they are still fun today and totally worthwhile. xD
