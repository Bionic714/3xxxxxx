Game Info
KAO, our young cute yellow kangaroo will have to save the world of animals from Barnaba an evil Hunter and his wicked henchmen. This time, he can count on his friends, like the firefly and the parrot, to help him out achieve his difficult task. The evil Hunter has started his cruel enterprise again. He has set a strong group of his supporters in different lands and with their help captured and traded their inhabitants. His deeds brought a lot of fuss and nervousness to the world of animals. The Hunter's headquarter was established in the Port Town, from where he rules all the lands. Kao starts his adventure locked in a cage travelling in a ship to the Port Town. Luckily during the journey the Parrot finds Kao and destroys his cage so, when the ship docks he manages to escape. Wandering around the Port he meets the Parrot again, which tells him fate of other animals and asks him for help. Kao has to visit all the worlds, helping animals and collecting coins. He needs them to bribe the guardian protecting the Gate leading to Hunter's Headquarters.

Main Engine Features

KAO CHALLENGERS presents more than 20 levels within 5 worlds that are visually and graphically totally unique showing an environment and an atmosphere that differentiate each world and level.

Kao needs lots of skills, in order to succeed in his quest, which means tens of animations. As almost every enemy has a different personality (it is especially underlined with bosses) they attack and behave in different ways. They jump, fly, throw objects and dodge Kao's attacks or swim and fight underwater. Smooth transitions and exaggerated but exact animations underline the cartoon style of the game and put life to all characters. Face mimics both of Kao and enemies bring more emotion to their movement and give them even more personality. The reality and attractiveness of the game is additionally boosted by special effects (motion blur, blending,). Flocks of birds or fishes based on particle systems and realistically moving objects calculated by physics simulator increase the interactivity of the environment, which gives the player a feeling of visiting an entire epic, imaginary, colourful but still very real world.
