Detection, Prevention and Protection of Spyware 
While the Internet is a powerful resource with a great variety of useful content, it is also rife with malicious software, broadly known as spyware. This software, which often comes disguised as the very same useful content, is unknown to most users, and it can track your surfing habits, profile your shopping preferences, and abuse your Internet connection by sending this data to a third party, all without your knowledge or permission.
