DEATH ROW (a.k.a. Pentagram)
Live at the Silver Fox, Northern Virginia, USA
Feb. 20, 1983
VCD format - 2 MPG files that will burn to VCD 

Approx. one hour & 40 minutes in length

VHS-to-DVD transfer of a 2nd generation audience video tape, one camera, tripod-mounted. Never released commercially.

Quality -- I would give it about a 7 on a scale of 1-10. However, considering the rarity of the footage, I'd give it an 11 for pure doom rock overkill! There are a couple of places where songs are cut off, or start mid-way through. That was done on the original tape -- not by me.
