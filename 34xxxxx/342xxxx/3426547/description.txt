It's hard to argue with The Muffs' cover of Kim Wilde's "Kids in America," and Counting Crows' live "The Ghost in You," 

Supergrass' "Alright," and an acoustic version of Radiohead's "Fake Plastic Trees." A pair of all-time pop-rock pantheon 

tracks get covered here to cautious approval -- both Cracker and World Party hold their own on more subdued renditions of The 

Flaming Groovies "Shake Some Action" and Mott The Hoople's "All the Young Dudes" respectively. Jill Sobule closes with her 

wry, deadpan "Supermodel." "I didn't eat yesterday, and I'm not going to eat today, and I'm not going to eat 

tomorrow...'cause I'm gonna be a supermodel..."
