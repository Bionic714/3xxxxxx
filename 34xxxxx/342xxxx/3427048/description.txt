The year is 2054. Fifty years ago, something terrible happened and the 
surface of Earth became uninhabitable. The remnants of humankind escaped 
to an immense flying island, the Laputa. However a revolt against 
increasingly rigid and corrupt human leadership of the island escalated 
into a conflict that eventually destroyed it. The survivors of the 
survivors flee once again. Can they reclaim the Earth from the unknown 
forces now holding her in their grasp?
