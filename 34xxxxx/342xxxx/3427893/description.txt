Monterey International Pop Festival
Box Set 

A sumptuous, four-CD box set with all the deluxe trimmings celebrating the grandaddy of all outdoor rock concerts. With legendary performances by Otis Redding, the Who, Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, the Byrds, and Paul Butterfield all taken from the mobile-unit multi-track masters, this box evokes a sound and an era the way few (if any) retrospectives of like material ever do. Important music from a turning point in rock's history.
