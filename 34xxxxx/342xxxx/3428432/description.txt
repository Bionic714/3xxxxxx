      ;    INFO: Che Guevara's amazing life story has   ;
      ;  lifted him to almost legendary status.  The    ;
      ;  larger-than-life hero of the 1959 revolutionary;
      ;  victory that overturned the Cuban dictatorship,;
      ;  Che believed that revolution would also topple ;
      ;  the imperialist governments in Latin America.  ;
      ;  His call to action, his proclamation of invinc-;
      ;  ibility, the ultimate victory of revolutionary ;
      ;  forces, continues to influence the course of   ;
      ;  Latin American history and international       ;
      ;  relations.  This book will help readers gain a ;
      ;  better understanding of Che's theoretical con- ;
      ;  tribution to revolutionary literature and the  ;
      ;  inspiration that his life and Guerrilla Warfare;
      ;  have provided to revolutionaries since the 60s.;
