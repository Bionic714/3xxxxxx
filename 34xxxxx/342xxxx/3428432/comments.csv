,GYMMY,2007-12-11T06:26Z,"Sure, let's all become communists so we can be a turd-world country like Cuba....idiots. Socialism and Communism NEVER works. It only accelerates the downfall of society. Get a job, lazy asses."
,RaptorFarmer,2008-05-21T17:41Z,"Sure capitalism is so great.

Everything we use is made by laborers, -everything- but oxygen.  Even water is purified by laborers.

What do capitalists do?  They sell laborers stuff made by laborers with the money they allow laborers to have.

Capitalism is just like communism, only capitalists (who dont care about you, only more money for themselves) are in charge of your life.

The only ""people"" who have anything to lose in communism are people who have too much power anyways."

,loonyloon,2012-04-06T16:02Z,"Yeah, everyone calls Che a murderer because they're reacting to his percieved coolness. In truth, he was a revolutionary international guerilla who wasn't all that successful. He's a really middling, but very interesting, figure. Also stop bitching about capitalism, it sucks."
