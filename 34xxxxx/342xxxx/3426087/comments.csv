,kermit the frog,2006-01-19T17:59Z,I just finished downloading but when playing Nero Showtime tells me that there is something wrong with the file or that Nero doeswn't support avi-files. Is the download corrupt?
,warpigx,2006-01-20T00:16Z,"well... there is nothing wrong with files, I just checked them. However you have sealed the deal that the rest will be mp4 format. -- thanks"

Thanks"

Not only that, but the first 4 seasons that I ripped are all done the same way untill I did mp4 format. I dont have a pc and I dont even know where to send you. good luck."

I have downloaded season 1 and 2 before and they works fine... so I don't know why isn't work... have tryed difrent players as Media Player Classic, WinDVD. PowerDVD, NeroShowtime, Windows media Player.... but no one could read the files... only says it wrong format..."
