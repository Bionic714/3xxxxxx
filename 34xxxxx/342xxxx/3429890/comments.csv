,xMajesticMeteorx,2010-10-23T15:56Z,"Yeah it fuckin' works but you might need a gamer mouse.

It has crashed a few times, and don't be surprised if some News web-page starts yakking through your speakers when you log-on, but it cancels out easily and doesn't seem to be dirty or else Norton 360 would not have allowed this download.

I only tried this because the fucker hosting the Leaderboard Golf abandoned his own fucking torrent, the fuck!
But I'll keep this motherfucker in Accessories unless something really great comes along. It's kinda cute, although there's some fucking long delays sometimes, but maybe that's 'cause I've only got 1.5 gig of Ram.

The wind is exaggerated on clubs and swinging extra hard doesn't seem to get you more distance with the irons, unless you're hitting with the wind behind you, then omg , lol.

No practice mode, so it's hell trying to figure out the shitty bunker and short game feature on this bitch.
There's no tracers like on billiards to spot yourself, so you're fucking in the dark once you click the mouse to activate the swing.
It seems like if you pause and watch the swing meter before you thrust forward it severely cheats you distance for the crime of trying to hit a 3/4 shot.
I've got a 345 yard drive on this bitch and no idea how it happened, lol. Just grip it and rip it and cuss at this bitch like me, I guess."
