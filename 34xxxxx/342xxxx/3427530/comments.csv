,usernamesaregay,2006-01-05T18:11Z,Can't get the sound to work.  What CoDec do I need?  I have Ace MegaCodec pack installed.

,wwefan,2006-01-06T12:35Z,"Low sound?  In your start menu, in your programs find AC3Filter ----> AC3Filter Config.  You can also get to it in your control panel.  There are 5 tabs at the top.  Main, Mixer, Equalizer, System, About.  In the Main tab, you'll find at the bottom middle a square section called Gains.  Move the Master slider ALL THE WAY up.  That's how it worked with the version I have 0.70b."
