The most significant addition to MotoGP 3 is a brand new Extreme mode that extends the playing experience even further for gamers. Reflecting the current passion for TT-style street racing, this exciting game mode consists of sixteen new city and suburban tracks. Based on actual race locations from around the world, such as the neon-lit streets of Japan and the country roads around Donington UK, these thrilling new tracks offer a unique, demanding and adrenaline-charged challenge that race fans will love. As well as the new tracks, gamers also have a richer choice of bikes thanks to the addition of sixteen original motorcycles. Modelled on real world bikes, these exclusive two-wheelers range in power from 600cc racers to 1200cc superbikes.
