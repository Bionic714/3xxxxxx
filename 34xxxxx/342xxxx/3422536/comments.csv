,mankylugs,2008-10-16T21:38Z,Great torrent but be aware that there should be 10 tracks not nine! The last track '10 wheels for Jesus' is missing for some reason?
,elpOp,2009-02-25T20:53Z,any seeds perhaps?
,Andy_von_Rampage,2009-03-10T19:37Z," aye! ""SEED perhaps"", indeed!!"
,GrimySolutions,2011-11-28T02:07Z,"firstly - mucho gracias for putting this rough but brilliant first album by The Beasts on PBay.
There is some confusion regarding this album. According to Tex Perkins'- the vocalist - website http://www.texperkins.net/release.php?aid=3&submit=go  there are only NINE TRAX on the album, as per the original vinyl release in Australia on Red Eye Records (RED 04):
1 - evil ruby
2 - love & death
3 - graveyard train
4 - psycho
5 - drop out
6 - save me a place
7 - lonesome bones
8 - the day marty robbins died
9 - 10 wheels for jesus

part of the confusion may arise because the trax have been mistitled:
what is listed as Good Times is actually Drop Out, Drop out should read Save Me A Place
Save me A Place should read Lonesome Bones
Lonesome Bones should read Mart Robbins
Marty Robbins should read 10 Wheels."
