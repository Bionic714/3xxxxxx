,JimBob007,2006-07-19T10:45Z,"*I havnt managed to crack this on my own yet but I feel Im getting close* 

First find your ethernet number, open maya (product config will open too), select all tasks and then click on show hardware identifier. Write your ethernet number down.

Take the prekey.dat file, open it on a pc and type in your ethernet number after it says HOSTID= (removing the first and last numbers or letters)

Copy the prekey.dat back to your mac. Run findkey in terminal so 
cd Desktop/prekey
./findkey -i prekey.dat [install_licenses.sh]

It should say installation successful.

Then open up maya (product config will come up). Select all tasks and click install product license. Browse to prekey.dat you just modified. Install it. 

This is where it gets tricky, maya says it installs but it then goes back to the beginning of product config. Not running maya. 

Close but no cigar. Ill keep trying. I think its do to with the numbers before the HOSTID= part. Some kind of serial/code i cant figure. "
,tmo28278,2006-08-19T18:41Z,"I got the crack to work ^^

Here's the instructions for you, with visual aids :P

Hope it works for you too.

,dbmata,2006-10-06T22:14Z,"Thank you tmo, but I still couldn't get the install to work. I'll have to revisit it again next week."
,1ncr3d1bl3,2006-10-23T05:52Z,"ok. so thank you tmo28278 for the instructions. i tried them as well but didn't have any luck. finally, after several hours, it worked. let me show you all what i did.

first of all, you must use a pc and a mac to complete the process. these are the steps i followed. i know how frustrating it can be, so hopefully these work for you.

ON YOUR MAC

1. Install Maya.

2. Go to the Apple menu>About this Mac"">More Info

3. Click on Network and select built-in ethernet

4. Where it says ""Ethernet Address"", write those numbers down (no colons)

ON YOUR PC

1. You should have keygen.exe and aw.dat files for the crack. If you do not, go to this website and download them: http://www.bestcracks.net/get.php?id=176753

2. Copy the two files (aw.dat and keygen.exe) to your desktop.

3. Right click on aw.dat and choose ""open with."" Then choose select program, and choose to open it with wordpad.

4. Once it's open in wordpad, you'll see something that looks like this:

FEATURE MayaUnltd sgiawd 7.000 permanent uncounted 0 \ HOSTID=your_host

5. Erase where it says ""your_host"" and enter the 12 digit ethernet number i had you write down earlier (no colons)

6. Click save and close the file.

7. Now, on your desktop, drag the new aw.dat file onto the keygen.exe file. The screen should flash. To see if it worked, open up the aw.dat file in wordpad again. If it says error anywhere in the file, your ethernet numbers were probably entered wrong. If there is a string of numbers after the word ""uncounted,"" (NOT ZERO) then you've done it correctly.

8. Email yourself the aw.dat file.

BACK TO YOUR MAC

1. Open your email and download the aw.dat file. Open up your finder and choose Go>Go To Folder> and type var/flexlm/

2. Drag the aw.dat file into this flexlm folder. If there is already a file there and it asks if you want to replace, say yes.

3. Now simply go to your applications, run maya, and it should start up without a problem.

Good luck. Hopefully my instructions help!"
,1ncr3d1bl3,2006-10-23T05:56Z,"By the way, the above instructions were run on Windows XP and Mac OSX version 10.4.8

Not sure if that makes a difference?"
,Paris Cola,2006-11-03T19:47Z,"Hi, I am a new mac convert and I tried to follow your instructions for installing Maya on a mac mini.

Firstly step 

3. Click on Network and select built-in ethernet

I get built in fireWire only?

4. Where it says ""Ethernet Address"", write those numbers down (no colons)

What numbers?

Also where do I download the aw.dat file?

I am new to mac so I hope you guys can help!

Thanks

,BXJEZT25,2006-11-25T18:46Z,"I tried tmo's way and i didnt get it to work and it kept requesting an activation key. And 1ncr's way as well, thing is i dont have that folder Flexlm in my MAC so i didnt know where to drag the aw.dat file to. HELP!!!"
,reinform,2006-12-22T14:13Z,i try 1ncr3's way and it work. thankyou!
,spike2point0,2007-03-18T23:53Z,"ok, this is how you do it properly.

On your Mac:

install maya (duh)

download:  http://www.bestcracks.net/get.php?id=176753 and unpack it.

click on the apple icon on your toolbar > ""about this mac"" then 'more info' button.  then in system profiler click on ""network"" in the left hand pane then in the top right pane select 'Built in ethernet' then copy the ""MAC Address"" from the bottom pane without the colons (:). you should have 12 numbers and letters.

open up the crack folder you just downloaded, find ""aw.dat"" and open it with textedit.app, after it says HOSTID= put in your 12 digit MAC address without the colons instead of what's already there.  Then File>Save.

Transfer the aw.dat and the awkeygen.exe to a pc, stick them on the desktop and drag the aw.dat onto the awkeygen.exe icon,  this modifies the aw.dat with a character string based on your specific MAC address.  transfer the aw.dat back to your mac and throw the pc away.

Here is the tricky bit, the previous posts are all talking about /var/flexlm, this is on linux, not OSX, so here is what you do.

you have to use terminal, but not OSX's terminal, you have to use maya's terminal application which has some extra commands built in.

1)  mount the maya 7 disk image, open the prekey folder and copy its contents to your desktop (findkey, install_licenses.sh and prekey.dat) and put your modified aw.dat there too - this is important, don't skip any of these.

2)navigate to applications>alias>maya 7>    then open up ""Maya Terminal.term""

3) at the command prompt type      cd Desktop      then press return (the upper case 'D' is important here.

4) then type      findkey -i aw.dat      then press return

this uses the aw.dat to modify the maya serial lock in its default location inside maya.app.

you are done here, close that down and open maya.

you are welcome.  thank you, please come again."
,prabh07,2007-06-12T22:57Z,"Hi, I use OS 10.4.8, did ev'thing according the instructions. But lastly got this message 

""S.../Applications/Alias/maya7.0/Maya.app/Contents/bin/MayaENV.sh

Lastly when I jubilantly tried to start Maya, it said that it could not be started because there are no appropriate licences....etc. Is there any wayout? Plz help me, this is URGENT."
,Voluisse,2007-07-19T01:40Z,Please seed this! The comments are great and I would be indebted to you if you can keep this up. . . I'm trying to get my design portfolio together and need to have a 3d modeling program. My pc is dead this is the only program I know of running on a Mac.   Thanks ahead of time!!!
,spike2point0,2007-08-10T17:09Z,"Prabh07 - you missed the switch out before the command it's supposed to be -i aw.dat NOT i aw.dat the hyphen is crucial.  the error message that came up was the help file for the various switches allowed in maya's terminal shell.

hope this helps."
,guerrsa,2007-08-15T20:59Z,"wow dude...
thanx for this torrent i was only finding maya 8 and my mac isn't fast enough...

works perfectly!!!"
,cstyle83,2008-02-13T04:40Z,"dear spike2point0

where do I find maya terminal, it does not exist under the alias folder in application.  all that is there is production wizard, f check, and uninstall.
can i download the terminal seperately?
thank you so much for all your help :)"
,scarybuttfreezer,2008-04-19T00:03Z,"Okay, Spike2point0 --

First of all, thank you for the easy to follow instructions. Everything worked until the last portion. When using Maya's Terminal, this is what happened:

$ findkey -i aw.dat
License installation failed
A detailed license installation report may be found at: /tmp/alias_rpt_DeCP4f

any suggestions? I can't be satisfied with thinking it's just a bad .dat file if these other people also got it to work...

Thanks."
,scarybuttfreezer,2008-04-19T00:06Z,"And not just Spike, does anybody have any ideas?
Much appreciated."
,behemuthm,2008-07-04T18:43Z,spike2point0's method works perfectly--thanks so much!
