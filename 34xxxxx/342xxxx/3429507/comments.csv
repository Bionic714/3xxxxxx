,luke972,2008-01-31T07:09Z,You have to burn all 4 to seperate CD-R discs then install from the disc
,jacobseptembre63,2008-03-09T14:22Z,Thanks for the torrent ! Works fine if using 4 CDs. Works on PC and GPS without unclock.
,hunter-killer,2008-03-23T20:31Z,"This torrent works, you have to burn each image to a cd. Bad news is, it is old, very old in fact. This is version 2 from 2003, and you can tell this software is in it's infancy compared to whats out now. It's better than nothing, but not by much. Your decission if your hard up. I installed it, played with it, but deleted it and am looking for better."
,bromont,2008-04-15T22:06Z,"Yes this mapset is old, however it's the Topographic maps, the rivers, lakes and elevations don't change all that much. So this is good stuff for hiking and geocaching, if you want updated roads and POI's then you should look at the newest City Navigator. An alternative is to download the gmapsupp.img file here: http://thepiratebay.org/tor/4135476/gmapsupp.img

It contains these Topo maps stretching from coast to coast over the southern portion of Canada. You just stick the gmapsupp.img file in the Garmin directory on your memory card and insert into GPSr"
,Eot,2008-04-17T22:49Z,I have burned all four to disk and i am still having the same problem. It wont accept the 2nd disk? Mabey i have burned it incorrectly? Any help would be great! 
,xooloo,2008-08-25T06:45Z,"Absolute Perfection. Scan reported clean with NOD32, thanks! 

Run Ccleaner to fix any registry glitches first.

Then use Nero to burn 4 individual (image files) to 4 single DVD or CD discs. That would be disc 1, disk 2, etc...

Install from the discs. Don't forget to update mapsource online at Garmin.

Reboot."
,SaultDon,2008-12-23T19:49Z,"would love this torrent, so if anyone could seed, i would most certainly appreciate it! I will seed for a good time after also."

Use a tool like Daemon Tools Lite, and when it asks for disc 2, just mount disc 2 on the same drive, works perfect! No need to waste cd's."
,sroddy,2009-01-17T20:23Z,"downloaded, installed by disc and onto my garmin-works great, no glitches."
,Shazam_777,2009-05-28T03:07Z,"Dudes, this is an OLD version.  

A BRAND new version has just come out about a month ago!!!  

Please locate and SEED.  Thanx!!!!"
