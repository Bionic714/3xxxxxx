,missy84,2006-01-05T17:57Z,hi i downloaded the files but cant get them to open in windows media player. It says there is an error and has to close. Any know how to view the files? Please let me know. THanks
,zele36,2006-01-05T21:28Z,I just downloaded 2cd and I can open Rar!!!The file is damaged or unknown format!? Please Help ME!!!
,missy84,2006-01-06T10:34Z,i downloaded the other mpeg version. It worked couldnt get this one to work. Maybe its just me GL
,Noplis,2006-01-06T15:04Z,"I dont know why it doesnt work for some of you. Try to remove the file that is damaged and try to download that file again. If you dont know how to download just that one file just delete it and then click ""download this torrent"" again.  Just make sure that that the rest of the files are in the right map so your bt client finds it."
,dexbot,2006-01-07T19:26Z,YouÂ´re the man Noplis
,Ha$himoto,2006-01-08T17:22Z,"I downloaded it but cant unrar it. Winrar says it dosnt have an archive. And I cant open the sample clipp either. 

same thing happend to me...buhu. :("
,Noisemaker,2006-01-10T13:16Z,"Try a newer version of winrar, no problems unpacking here.
If you're having trouble watching this in Windows media player, google ffdshow and ac3 codec and install that, then it should work."
,thomas87,2006-02-10T14:44Z,"Please, somebody upload some old episodes. 1-28 would be great."
