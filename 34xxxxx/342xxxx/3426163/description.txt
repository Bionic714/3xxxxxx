So....
I noticed the lack of my favourite bedtime cartoon from 70s. A Czech production named Krtek (A Mole). This part contains eight episodes.


1. Krtek's colorful dream
2. Krtek - chemist
3. Krtek - photographer
4. Krtek - painter
5. Krtek on the desert
6. Krtek in ZOO.
7. Krtek - watchmaker
8. Krtek and an eagle.

Hope you like it.
