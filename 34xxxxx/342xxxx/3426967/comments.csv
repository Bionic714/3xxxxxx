The video starts with a jet fighter attacking a village.

This is one of, if not the biggest crisis on the planet today.
How much have you heard about it?"
,NegatoryNegatory,2006-01-02T22:24Z,"Today, as genocide rages in Darfur, Sudan, the world stands by, failing the vow of ?never again? that it made after the Holocaust and reaffirmed after the Rwandan genocide. The genocide in Darfur has claimed 400,000 lives and displaced over 2,500,000 people. More than one hundred people continue to die each day; five thousand die every month."
,NegatoryNegatory,2006-01-02T22:26Z,"Darfur is not a mere humanitarian disaster that access by international relief agencies can reverse. The raison d'ĂŞtre of the atrocities committed by government-supported Arab militias is the racist, fundamentalist, and undemocratic Sudanese state. What is required for peace in Sudan is either regime change, in which a democratic, inclusive state is born, or a partition, in which the black African south and west become an independent sovereign state free of Khartoum and the Arab north."
,NegatoryNegatory,2006-01-03T01:15Z,"Is the news really fair and balanced?

To not report these atrocities is a crime in itself.
Ask yourself and others what is wrong with the media, that the worlds biggest crisis goes unreported each and every day?

It is costing more lives.
It really does sadden me."
,NegatoryNegatory,2006-01-03T02:17Z,"""Every day we surveyed evidence of killings: men castrated and left to bleed to death, huts set on fire with people locked inside, children with their faces smashed in, men with their ears cut off and eyes plucked out, and the corpses of people who had been executed with gunshots to the head. "
,NegatoryNegatory,2006-01-03T02:55Z,"In 1948, the United Nations drafted an international definition of genocide in the hopes of preventing another Holocaust. The convention determined that ?genocide means any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such: Killing members of the group; Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group; Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part; Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group; or Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.? If the UN declares a group guilty of genocide, member countries are bound to act. Strangely enough, however, in February 2005, the UN reported that the Khartoum were not guilty of committing genocide. They instead found that crimes against humanity and war crimes were taking place in Darfur."

,scottsasse,2011-09-20T06:26Z,"@ NegatoryNegatory, I hate to say this but what do you expect of the Muslim people, violence is inbred to their religion!! I wish that were not true but it is. I have watched countless documentary and independent media reports on Sudan and other Islamic countries. I have seen video of children no older than 6 being punished for stealing fruit by having their arm run over and crushed by a heavy-duty truck and adult offenders have both their hands and feet amputated. It would be more humane to simply put a bullet in their brains instead. However, those filthy Muslims LOVE to watch this, in fact it draws a bloodthirsty crowd. Religion of peace my ass, Mohammad was a pedophile and murderer!! And that was his good side. These people would be better off worshiping Satan!! I'm sad that all this is true and I wish I could get the images of what I've seen out of my head but if I ignore the truth then I'm just as ignorant and guilty as they are!! The only way to stop this genocide you speak of would be to commit genocide on a larger scale and that is NOT what the UN is about. Peace and Love, DrScott"
