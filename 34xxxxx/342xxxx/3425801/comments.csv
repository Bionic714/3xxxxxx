What can I do?"
,untouchableman,2006-02-27T19:28Z,I have also installed with no joy?
,CaineRau,2006-08-28T17:16Z,"Before installing the games, disable the internet connection. If no, the games connect to gamehouse.com and won't accept any code created with the keygen.It happend with 2 games to me. Without internet all works great 100%."
,dmoore,2006-10-02T07:09Z,"The prior message was correct - you MUST disable your internet connection prior to entering your keygen codes.  If you enter the codes while you are connected to the internet, the codes entered after will not work, even if you are disconnected.  You will have to delete the keys from the registry to 'reset' the ability to enter the codes."
