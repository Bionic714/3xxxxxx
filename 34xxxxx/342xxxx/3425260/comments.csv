,scirius,2009-01-18T20:08Z,"thank you geanius; this is a awesome torrent, great job."
,argentino450,2009-03-08T22:56Z,"um I installed it and I can't hear a thing in-game, can someone help me :/"
,energeticmouse,2009-04-06T22:50Z,@ argentino450: check your audio settings and/or your speakers. Well at least you've got the game at all. If you're on a laptop and you have no sound at all on anything hold the 'Fn' button and look for a button with a little speaker with a cross on it and see what happens. I'm on a medion laptop (the black and silver one) with windows XP and the mute/unmute button is F10. P.S. geanius; is there a crack within it or do i have to get one?
,energeticmouse,2009-04-07T21:56Z,I downloaded this piece of shit and it don't fucking work even though i installed it - sort of - Class? More like clASS! what the fuck are you tryin to do??? dickhead.
,Tayler1234,2009-06-19T20:37Z,"I dont have a setup.exe file but it says i must run that file next, ive unpacked everything and theres nothing like that!?!?!?!!?"
,Tayler1234,2009-06-19T20:40Z,"Never mind, my computer was doing its own shit, cool torrent, thanx"
,LokiTheCoyote,2009-08-09T09:50Z,"uhhh... what the fuck is this??... I was thinking this was the god game called black and white by EA.... I installed it, but nothing really seemed to happen... no idea where the exe file ended up if it is the game I'm looking for... all I could find was an icon called 'class' that when clicked on brings me to a screen with an oldschool floppy disc and some really bad techno music that sounds like it came from a cheesy SNES game... that I had to manually shut down my computer to exit

wtf???"
,TheUltra,2010-02-15T22:33Z,"Relatively fast download. Got the game in under an hour. Bad judging from the File size, but still, I got the game. A lost classic. It's a great game and this torrent works perfectly. Just run the unpacker, who'll run the setup, who'll unpack the game, and you're done. Works great."
,sniper23,2010-03-18T17:34Z,thanx 4 the few seeders still downloading dont no if it wrks taking fucking ages to download
,sniper23,2010-03-18T17:36Z,55%......................55.1%................etc
,HumanError,2010-05-11T07:02Z,"where is the runblack.exe?  if you click install a blue screen come up with some weird music. if you click .nfo it'll give you the directions on how to install black and white, but i am stuck on the last step. any help?"
,pjsullivan5,2011-03-29T06:45Z,"well i am stuck on step 2, i cant find the setup.bat I am really excited to play this game pleasee help!"
,nerdyguy,2011-04-12T23:23Z,"What I did:

1. Unrar ""black and white.exe""
2. Unrar ""black.ace""
3. Run ""setup.bat"" It will go through this black screen and then this other thing pops up talking about injecting files. Let it completely finish, or game wont run.
4. I clicked ""setup.exe"" but that just bring up the graphic settings.
5. ""runblack.exe"" to run the game.

Game works for me. Only problem I get though is a graphics one. parts of the screen become all glitchy and change colors rapidly. Other people refer to it as ""triangles of color."" Hoping to find a solution, if I do, I'll post again."
,nerdyguy,2011-04-12T23:25Z,"Also, my computer should be able to run this. I can play fable(from the same company) and command and conquer 3 tiberium wars on it. I am, however, running on windows xp. This could be the problem..."
,nerdyguy,2011-04-12T23:51Z,"Ok, so apparently there are people out there running it on xp. To fix the graphics problem, you can try this http://www.gamefaqs.com/boards/914356-black-and-white/45102710 .

But it didn't work for me :/ Still have the glitchy triangles of color..."
,rashen63,2011-05-19T06:45Z,I am having trouble with my set up. I went through all the steps but i am stuck on the final step. As far as i can tell there is no runblack.exe and i cannot find it. Any help would be greta. thank you
,dagon19,2011-05-30T17:42Z,"i am new at the torrent thing here and just asking 
how do you run the game and how do you get it to work when i get done with the download thanks for
the help."
,mw2pro123,2011-06-14T12:48Z,thanks man works perfect! :D the seeds dont matter its still 600kb/s THANKS! 
,paperjac,2011-07-09T00:34Z,how do upgrade it to v1.30? because when i try to install patch v1.3 it say black & white not installed. can anyone help me
,arrlinny,2012-01-19T02:05Z,i let 'setup.bat' run after doing all the steps but then a dialogue box comes up to tell me that an audio file cannot be written. I'm wondering if this is a problem? And I can't find 'runblack.exe'.. so where do you find it? help please! 
,Stormy66,2012-05-21T02:28Z,"@LokiTheCoyote
If you're trying to troll, do it right. EA didn't even make the game, dumbass."
