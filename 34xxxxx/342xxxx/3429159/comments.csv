,dunit719,2006-03-31T18:20Z,"thanks for the help jonasmannen it got my warcraft 3 to work. 

 I was just wondering if this works for The Frozen Throne update because when ever i try to install that it comes up with the same old thing about needing to put in the CD.  If this is not for TFT do you know if there is somewhere that i can get that nocd patch.  

Thanks again,
      Dunit"
