Windows XP Borg Edition V 5.0

This is it....the last edition until vista is released.......

I have used Winrar to compress this edition.....Uncompress it ONLY ONCE! The iso is inside....
Go to [COLOR=orange]www.iso-tek.org[/COLOR] for support but, READ ME FIRST!
This compilation DVD will install windows automatically after you tell it where to install to. DO NOT upgrade....DO NOT install over another windows install.


[SIZE=7]!!!!!!!!!!!YOU MUST FORMAT AND DO A FRESH INSTALL!!!!!!!!![/SIZE]

Upon initiating a fresh, clean install, windows will not ask for a serial, or activation, or registration! If it does...your doing it wrong! SEE Above!
After windows completes installation and after first reboot, the WPI Borg menu will appear for 120 seconds for you to choose your own programs.
When you click the install button, everything you selected will be silently installed - no user interaction is required.
If you do not click anywhere on the menu screen before 120 seconds has elapsed, a default selection of about 30 apps will install automatically.
 The serial and cracks folder has been updated as well so, if your chosen app is not " cracked" then go there and get the appropriate can opener.
Any cracks with an NFO file - use the notepad and READ IT! Any cracksserials that I missed......Humor me - go and find them yourself!

If you get blue screen or freezes - then you may not be able to use this DVD....I tried to make it as compatible as possible
for as many machines as I could but, I can't include drivers for every configuration or I would not have any space left for any apps!
There are over 10,000 drivers or more for various manufacturers out there so I expect a few problems in that area.....Every other Borg edition worked quite well 
for the magority of people but........I don't appreciate whiners whose comps fall through the cracks - live with it!
