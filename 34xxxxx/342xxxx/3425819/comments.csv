,geetoo,2006-01-04T09:52Z,and what is the situation with MS hotfix's? any installed? till what date?
,Bong_boy,2006-01-04T18:58Z,i don't know what else to say except thank you. i am still using the first version without any --- ANY --- trouble at all. for all you people who complain about these editions fuck off! go buy windows then - BORG RULES!!!
,bartofborg,2006-01-05T06:50Z,The only virustrojan in this dvd is in the cracks and serials folder.....in an archive called crack searchers. I left it alone becuse alot of peeps have said that most of the Anti-Virus companies are flagging it because of it's illegal usage and not because it actually has anything in it....you be the judge - use it or delete it. It's archived so it will only be a problem if you unzip it.
,bartofborg,2006-01-05T06:52Z,Not sure how up to date the hotfixes are - be a big boy and update it yourself - the WGA crack is included in the cracks folder....
,CaaL,2006-01-07T03:16Z,Is this a mutli language? or just a specific laguange?
,bartofborg,2006-01-07T09:20Z,It is an english set up....but I never removed the language packs.
,kjellmb,2006-01-07T12:22Z,Anyone got a serial key?
,kjellmb,2006-01-07T12:23Z,sorry... Read the nfo now. Got it;)
,bartofborg,2006-01-08T04:48Z,LOL....it's not the torrent file that's the problem.....If your blaming the torrent file for the fact you can't download it....you don't know what the hell your doing....and that is NOT the torrent files fault!
,bartofborg,2006-01-08T17:46Z,Well Reg....all the peeps I made this DVD for are not complaining about connection issues...only you are. This tells me where the problem lies......

,bartofborg,2006-01-14T02:18Z,"I forgot to add the WGA Crack into the serials and cracks folder.....You'll have to get it and install it your selves, I'm afraid......then you will be able to use windows update....."

,Pope John Paul 2,2006-02-13T13:54Z,"I don?t know how you went about bringing together such an essential collection of cool progs, much less the skills needed to formulate a software that runs so seamlessly together, but your torrent really fires! Helped me enormously!

Should PBay finally get around to ranking the best & smartest contributors in a year (the Long John Gold/Sliver/Bronze awards, let us say?), my vote would go to you without a second?s thought. 
If ?ere you?re down Munich way, a cold beer and a warm welcome awaits? Any brighter, and there?d be an ozone layer named after you?"
,blaze7,2006-02-25T18:10Z,"Awsome. Version 5, thanks :-)"
,mr monkey,2006-02-26T17:11Z,"brilliant collection of progs there, thumbs up!

just one query ,there isnt any macromedia or 3d graphics rendering software like 3DS max
i know its somwhere else on the pbay site but it helps to have it all in one big torrent"

,tonyboner,2006-06-05T07:10Z,"Grunk, you need to restart your computer and have it boot from the CD (check your BIOS settings).  Once you booted from the CD, you also need to format your hard drive before you install WinBorg."

,Gyokuran,2006-10-08T14:12Z,Is there a reason why cmdow.exe contains a HackTool.HideWindow hack that my SAV recognizes as a high probability trojan risk?
[T],bi20,2006-10-16T11:30Z,"Gyokuran, use google for ""cmdow"" to know what kind of program is it.

this is the first result I got:
http://www.pandasoftware.com/virus_info/encyclopedia/overview.aspx?IdVirus=86435&sind=0"
,charincol,2006-11-06T02:58Z,"CMDOW.EXE is NOT a trojan or a virus.  It is a very useful tool to hide command-line windows if you use a lot of batch files, etc. and don't want the windows to show up.   Just as it can be used for productive purposes, it's also used for destructive purposes by hiding command-line viruses and trojans from you when they're doing their dirty work.  No different than baseball bats.  In the hands of baseball players, they can hit home runs.  In the hands of criminals, they can bust kneecaps.

It's in this package so that everything is silently installed and you can go, ""Wow, how did everything get on my computer?"" when it's done."
,buster2823,2006-11-14T19:01Z,"Ok, I am seeding this. I will be seeding this for a while. When I first downloaded it there was one seeder. Yeah, for this program that is not acceptable. More people should have access to this. When you are done downloading this, please seed it until you have a share ratio of 2.5 or greater to ensure that more people can get this. If you can just seed it indefinitely (like I am doing) that would be better. Thanks!"

,passass,2010-10-04T20:49Z,"Well the only thing I that really annoys me is that someone makes a torrent like this one, which is ""rare"" or hard to find on the web and when it shows up, than no1 is seeding it.
I ain't asking for some technical support or instructions on how to burn or install (which are at my opinion amateur questions), the only thing I need right now is a bigger number of seeding >> even if only 50 kB/s.
I like the guy who seeded at 100-350 kB/s to my pc, but as he only has 64.6% of the torrent, so do I. And as far as I can see no1 except me and him are downloading/uploading or even possessing the torrent file.  "
