,katamail,2006-07-07T11:31Z,"I say deport all muslim's as we are at war with terrorism and 99.9% of the terrorist's are muslims, in the Second world war the U.S either deported or imprisoned all Japanese living in the country and they were'nt going around bombing skyscrapers or train stations."
,user88,2006-12-05T16:45Z,deport muslims??!! how about the new converts? where they should go?
,bl00dcl0t,2008-01-08T19:53Z,"katamail needs to get a life, instead of looking for every islamic-ish looking torrent to leave the same brainless comment. (yes it's true)

Some people have toooooo much time on their hands."
,rockstar11998,2008-03-05T16:52Z,I have a lot of time on my hands too!  Islam preaches hate and intolerance at its core.  Those who convert believing otherwise are like many Christians who blindly follow their preachers rather than actually studying the Bible themselves.  Islam = compulsion and loss of free will.  No true God would promote that.  The Koran is a Satanic perversion of old testament teachings and Christianity.   Satan at his best.
,rockstar11998,2008-03-05T16:57Z,"One more thing.  Islam came into its religious existance much later than Christianity and Judaism yet it wants to wipe both out.  Why would an upstart religion try to do this! For power and tyranny.  Throughout the dark ages they were a conquering religion, forcing others to convert or die."
,rockstar11998,2008-05-30T07:20Z,"InTheCrack - The following countries deserved to be bombed by the US for murdering and killing innocent people within their own country - Laos, Cambodia, Sudan, Afghanistan, Iraq, Panama, Grenada, Korea, China, Guatemala, Cuba, Indonesia, Congo, Peru, El Salvador, Libya, Nicaragua, and Yugoslavia. You asked what is terrorism? It is leading your people by fear rather than basing the government on freedom and democracy. LOL retard."

,rockstar11998,2008-07-12T19:18Z,driver76 - LOL I like the BBC.  They are very good at uncovering the truth.  I just wish more of the USA news shows were as bold as the BBC in their tellings of what Islam is really like (the bad stuff of course). I have learned a great deal about how bad Islam is in Europe through the BBC.  Undercover Mosque is a hit with me.  Keep up the good programming BBC.

""You asked what is terrorism? It is leading your people by fear rather than basing the government on freedom and democracy""  

Forgetting history leads to an unhealthy mind.
Lest we forget how America felt about people of color or more recent the RED Russian Commies.
Hmmm last i checked America instills fear in most of its citizens and creates most policies through this vehicle.  Ignorance and arrogance are Americas greatest weaknesses. BTW-im not muslim, but im not ignorant either and im sick and tired of seeing this political racist bulshit on every forum. why the mods tolerate this is beyond me. "
,matook,2009-02-16T20:56Z,"PEDOPHILIA:muhammud got married to Aisha when she was 6 and raped her when she was 9 --dont forget he was a ""prohet"" and his ""god should have told him its wrong to have sex with kids or to behead his prisonners"" dont forget we""re talking about this muhammud the criminal so dont give me the usual answer what christian did or did not do or what the west has done or has not --admit to the facts you might regain integrity .....(i""m no christian or jew)"
,ada357345,2009-03-30T06:54Z,Very good documentaries but terrible video quality. The videos have very visible interlace artifacts (lines running across the video). May be the upload should mention something about the video quality next time he uploads something.
