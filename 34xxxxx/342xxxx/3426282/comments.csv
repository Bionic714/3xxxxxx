,SynGate,2008-04-05T10:26Z,"This album is officially available through our label www.syngate.net ;-)
So go ahead, download it, but please remember that SynGate artists do not have a big label behind them and can only keep making music by selling the very few copies we sell - we are not Justin Timberlake - so if you like this album, please buy a legal copy, OK? Illegal download quite simply kills the music, and if honest music made with the heart dies to leave room only to commercial crap made by marketing guys, the world loses something important: a part of its soul.
Thanks ;-)
SynGate Records, an independent label that works with enthusiam for the music!!!"
