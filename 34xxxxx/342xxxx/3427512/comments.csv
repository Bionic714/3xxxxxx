,killswitch2k,2006-01-04T01:58Z,Thanks for uploading!! This is a great comedy
,.dOnKeY.,2006-01-04T20:36Z,"Thanks! Now how about some details? Is this a DVD-R? MPEG4 files? What codecs are needed? 

ANY information would be appreciated before a 4GB download, mate."
,BBBAtrac,2006-01-04T22:33Z,".dOnKeY - The codecs are randome, the quaity is nice on all episodes, how about just downloading 1 of the files. (you can do that with bitcomet)

The seasons are put together of what i could find, so this is far far from a original release.

It's worth it! :)"
,.dOnKeY.,2006-01-04T23:02Z,No worries. I'm just glad someone got Series 2 up! Thanks again!
,deanobambino,2006-01-23T18:47Z,"This is amazing. I have all of Season 1, most of Season 3, and Some of Season 2, but i've had trouble finding the remaining episodes.

Thankyou so much uploader. Its a big file, but definitely worth it. This is the best British comedy around at the moment in my opinion.

I just hope people can seed it as much as possible.

Thanks once again, excellent work :)"
,possa,2006-01-29T23:29Z,NIIIIIIIIIIICE! I have been looking for season 2 and like 2 ep of season 3 for a long time...where did u find em'?
,yondergirl,2006-05-23T20:30Z,"I have no sound on season 1. Picture looks good, but no sound. Season 2 and 3 works nicely. Why? "

,juniperz,2007-01-18T01:17Z,"This is one of my fav shows -- this download has now made me a believer in torrents.

Does anyone have ""That Mitchell and Webb"" show?"
,squowse,2007-03-26T01:24Z,This is the one to download! Totally addicted to this programme. All files are AVI - can be viewed on media player or converted to DVD video files using nero etc; As the uploader says - you can download the episodes one at a time if you want. Thanks a million.
,_Happy_,2007-05-19T00:17Z,"A Massive thanks to the uploader, you are a f*****g LEGEND MATE!!!

This is by far the best British comedy I have seen in ages!

Just a quick comment though:

,kneebutt,2010-04-07T09:52Z,"So far I've only watched eps 1 and 3 of season 1 and neither have any audio.  They work fine (with audio) on VLC media player, but for those of you who, like myself, hate fucking around fixing up downloads once they've finished downloading, don't bother.  And before any of you fancy bitches jump up and down in your mothers basement, where I live we pay for everything we download - which makes half arsed ups like these a fucking nightmare.  Still got an issue with what I'm saying?  Bite me, your mother thinks you're special, the rest of us know you're just a cunt."
