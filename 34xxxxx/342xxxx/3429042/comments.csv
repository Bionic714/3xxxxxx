As long as that is the way arab world sees things, you people will never be able to do anthing against anybody!"

They also censored the video of Palestinians celebrating in Ramallah after the 9/11 attacks



How about the pictures of Palestinians posing with the severed heads of Israeli soldiers after they blew up a Merkava tank?



We are also not given the reality of Arab occupation of many lands outside of Arabia, which used to belong to Jews, Berbers, Samaratins, Copts, Assyrians, and Maronites. Of course Arabs are upset that the Jews regained their land back from these Arab occupiers.

,iceman45,2006-01-08T10:22Z,The video of palestinians celebrating after 911 turned out to be fake. Not surprising its censored.
,w000ter,2006-01-08T14:41Z,"no, the celebration was very real."
,w000ter,2006-01-08T14:52Z,their schools/government sanctioned religious leaders/government officials/government media in all forms preach hatred and war to their children creating generations of hitler youth. its not hard to understand why there is no peace.  they've squandered their childrens potential for the sake of revenge and rabid religious hatred. www.pmw.org.il
,w000ter,2006-01-08T14:52Z,"and until the palestinians wake up from their culture of hate and death there will be no peace.  they have to accept the right of israel to exist.  not just the fact of existence that can be changed through future actions, but an actual right to exist.  and not by just a few palestinians but the majority. they are no where close.

,w000ter,2006-01-08T14:55Z,"you ask yourselves why do their children blow themselves up, and attack tanks.  look back to the descriptions of the zealous fanatical fighters that were the hitler youth fighting in doomed battles."
,w000ter,2006-01-08T15:15Z,"and of course they go through the walls, they've had a great many so called innocent palestinian homes kill soldiers with booby traps.

as for the video, how do you think this is helping you.  it was broadcast in israel because it is not acceptable by their society.  the palestinians on the other hand would have no soul searching but instead celebrate and call for more death.  the fact palestinians get health care from israeli hospitals all the time, even wounded militants at times."
,printan,2006-01-08T17:17Z,"""They also censored the video of Palestinians celebrating in Ramallah after the 9/11 attacks ""

The clips of Palestinians celebrating after 9/11 are now officially debunkt as a fake newsclip made by an Israeli photographer. The palestinians was given treats to act in front of the camera and they did not know what for.

Perhaps thats the reason why its censored.

You really should keep up with current events. "

Former Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, when asked what the 9/11 attacks means for relations between the US and Israel, replies, ?It's very good.? Then he edits himself: ?Well, not very good, but it will generate immediate sympathy.? [New York Times, 9/12/01 (C)] A week later, the Village Voice states, ?From national networks to small-town newspapers, the view that America's terrible taste of terrorism will finally do away with even modest calls for the restraint of Israel's military attacks on Palestinian towns has become an instant, unshakable axiom. ... Now, support for Israel in America is officially absolute, and Palestinians are cast once again as players in a global terrorist conspiracy.? [Village Voice, 9/19/01] "
