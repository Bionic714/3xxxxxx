This is a CBC story by Canadian journalist Neil MacDonald, of unknown date.

It tells the story of an Israeli operation where a Palestinian wife was killed.

Its a good example of the lives of ordinary Palestinians. A reality that many jews in Israel see, but that Americans don't because CNN and others refuse to run such stories.

This off course amounts to censorship.

A picture is also included of Israeli soldiers posing with a dead Palestinian.

We all know of the horrors of suicide bombings, but we are not given the reality of the Israeli occupation.

Spread. Multiply. Enjoy!
