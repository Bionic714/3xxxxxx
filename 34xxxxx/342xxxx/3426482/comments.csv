Also have some D'unbelievables stuff so if people show some interest in Irish TV stuff I will up more but if not then I will leave it at this... "
,sadmafioso,2006-01-03T20:31Z,"Mate, you're a hero! I saw this when I went back to Dublin at xmas. We need more people like you out there. 
Some D'unbelievables stuff would be great! I miss (some..) Irish TV not living there. Don't suppose you've any of the newer Podge & Rodge shows? Just thought I'd ask.
But thanks again.

please do upload Irish episodes as I suspect there is a large pent up demand, especially for the large overseas population. thanks very much, pat
ps you don't have any gaelic hurling rips. I'd like to show the best game to some locals out here. "

,honkey,2006-12-01T12:40Z,could someone please reseed
,init6,2007-06-29T06:35Z,"It's unlikely anyone will see this, but I'm extremely interested in as much of this series as I can get. If people started seeding I'll KEEP seeding until well after I get the whole series.

I'm in the US but some of my best mates are Irish and we've just about exhausted doing Father Ted bits in the pub. 

I NEED THIS SERIES! :D"
