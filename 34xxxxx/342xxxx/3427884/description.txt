About the Game:
   The game features a very interesting plot, and a fun and intense multiplayer game. AS you progress in skirmishes, you can gain ranks, and flaunt your ranks online. The campain will take you a while, and is a great cinematic experience. The cuscenes and gameplay intertwine quite enjoyably.
