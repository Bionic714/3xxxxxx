Tony Buzan, author of the best-selling Use Your Head and inventor
of the revolutionary Mind-Mapping technique, has acquired fame
by improving the memory and learning capability of thousands of people.

In this book, based on the latest research into the workings of the human
brain, he presents an ingenious system for training the memory to achieve
extraordinary feats.


The book provides surprising, yet simple, techniques for remembering
names, dates, phone numbers and appointments. Special programmes
are given for card players and there is a useful section for students on
how to attain optimum examination results.


Buzan reveals his methods with engaging enthusiasm, drawing upon
extraordinary, surreal images to illustrate how the mnemonic system
works. Some of these images are illustrated in full colour. For anyone
who has difficulty in remembering facts and figures, people and places,
Use Your Memory will be invaluable.
