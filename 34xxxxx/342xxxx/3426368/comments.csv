TO berenjena, try running it in compatability mode for windows me, 2000, or xp. if that dont work then it may not be compatable with ur graphicscard, or u dont meet the requirements of the game, hope this helped you"
[T],FuCtUpPuNk,2008-04-17T22:51Z,"berenjena, wait lol...if u do compatability only try 2000 and xp, as 4 those r the required windows. btw are u using vista? if so then thas y it wont work and the compatability thing will do it 4 u, to run in compatability mode, right click the shortcut to the game, select properties, then a window pops up, top of it will have some options, 1 is compatability. choose that, the rest is easy man"
