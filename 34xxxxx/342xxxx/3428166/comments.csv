Assassin is a ""cover"" of Assault on Precinct 13 music..."
,micleg,2006-01-06T20:13Z,"3dcandy: you're right! It was from Assault... The 12 inch I remember had ""disco covers"" of both Assualt and Escape songs. But it was called ""Die Klapperschlange"" (the snake in English, like Snake Plissken). Oh, these were great times, late 70's and most of the 80's. "
