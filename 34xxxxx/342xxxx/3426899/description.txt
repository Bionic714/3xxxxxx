Make no bones about it, Naughty By Nature has a knack of bringing street intellect to 

the pop charts with raw-edged but still accessible East Coast rap. Long before the 

bling bling of the '90s ushered in a new era, Naughty By Nature stood tall atop the 

pack with machine-gun snares and heavy kick drums perfect for your stereo or party. 

While this greatest-hits compilation is nowhere as strong as 1999's Nature's Finest 

greatest-hits compilation, it does include selections from 2002's IIcons release 

(replacing cult hit "Clap Yo' Hands" in the process). Track inclusions/omissions aside, 

this is still a solid greatest-hits package and a wonderful testament to one of the 

East Coast's most lethal hip-hop groups.
