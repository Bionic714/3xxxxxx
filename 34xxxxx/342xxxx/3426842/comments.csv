,Ardinia,2006-01-02T23:18Z,"Rockie_69, oboiusly you sir do not know what you are talking about. this is WINDOWS XP EMBEDDED, NOT XP PRO.

,Rockie_69,2006-01-03T02:32Z,READ MY PM BIATCH!
,Rockie_69,2006-01-03T02:42Z,"AND FOR YOUR INFORMATION, IT IS ADVERTISED ON THE WEBSITE AS A ***120 DAY TRIAL*** SO AGAIN, IF YOUR GONNA POST SOMETHING, GET YOUR FACTS RIGHT FIRST, AND ANYWAYS, IT WOULD BE ***MUCH*** QUICKER DOWNLOADING IT FROM MICROSOFT LIKE I DID HAHA!!!"
,Ardinia,2006-01-03T02:49Z,"well that nice, but this is a full version, not a 120day trial off the MS website.  the full install key and image key are in the NFO.

so have fun with your 120day trial off the M$ website."
,Ardinia,2006-01-03T03:07Z,"If the description is still confusing to anyone, please visit http://www.microsoft.com/windows/embedded/default.mspx and read up on it.

If you still don't know what this is, don't download it."
,Drakool,2006-01-03T18:20Z,I've been waiting for this torrent for ages. Thanks Ardinia. It would be nice if someone could upload Platform Builder 4/5. Embedded Windows CE is lovely too.
,Ardinia,2006-01-05T02:02Z,It's nice that someone out there know what Embedded really is.  I will keep my eye out for CE.  We may even have it with our MSDN or Select Subscription.
,PidGin128,2006-01-07T02:36Z,"Thanks for this, should be interesting to play with. If anything else related / similar has been upped, would anyone mind mentioning it here, since I am not sure what it would be called / titled."
,colonel angus,2006-01-10T02:25Z,"Thanks Ardinia...I've been looking for a good copy of xp embedded.  interesting comments by people that don't know what ""xp embedded"" is all about."
,Ardinia,2006-01-10T23:10Z,"yes, and getting offended when you try and tell them what ""xp embedded"" really is. but thems the breaks. :)"

Anyone tryed creating a build with bts packs intergreated into it? I'm guessing its dooable but would take some time coz i dont think you can batch import can you?

The question is where to find SP2 but not Feature Pack? Any advices?"
,catmada,2008-08-17T23:14Z,"Sorry, it's better to read what Autoruns say.

It's on CD3."

,nightmaim,2010-02-26T03:56Z,"IT WORKED!: After 3 days w/out sleeping I found a solution: It seems that you MUST specify the size of partition in Target Designer or the key won't work. In the middle panel, click in your TD name and go to Settings, look to the right panel and click ""Target Device Settings"", set your boot partition size, in my case 2048 MB, also check other informations, then use this serial (same provided with this torrent):

WR96Q-VJFK9-7QFH3-YJTBM-8R666

,bearzoo,2012-01-23T04:26Z,"Thank you ULer Ardinia. I'd kiss you through your computer screen for your kindness... if that wasn't creepy, then I inadequately demonstrated how much I love you for this.

Wow Rocky, I have a feeling your mother was a drinker. A heavy drinker. To call you a moron is an insult to the simple people.

For all the jacks who can't read the info file, don't know what it is, want something different. Jeeze, what are you doing here? And finally, to the clown shouting seed in all caps but never coming back for a thank you, get over yourself and get a better connection. You're not that important, and if you were, you'd probably have a better internet connection.

It sailed in for me at about 1200 kB/s average and finished before I finished reading the comments and writing mine."
,bearzoo,2012-01-23T04:33Z,"Oh yah, and t06afre. That's a neat idea. Thanks. Seems like it might be a matter of luck finding a matching serial. Perhaps you could share some of the ones you got. Dunno. I've found some rarer xp keys off ebay images before. That was just manufacturers specific bios keys. "
,techfreek,2012-05-30T09:10Z,"If Anyone is facing the Runtime License Error; Make sure you::
1) Specify the exact ""Target Device Settings"" in Target Designer
2) Upgrade to SP2 from the 3rd CD (the runtime license wont work if you just install SP1)

Thanks a zillion Ardinia ; wonderful torrent!"
