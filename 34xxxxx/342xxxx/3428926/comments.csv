,Askanii,2011-09-10T08:42Z,"I wish I played the arcade Double Dragon 1&2 more when I was a kid. The NES version of them is OK, if your looking to relive the games, try the GAMEBOY Advance Version, pretty good re-make. This movie is just OK, but most of us grew-up with it, Long live Double-Dragon. :) "
