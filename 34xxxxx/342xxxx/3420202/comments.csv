,Typen,2006-01-06T15:29Z,"How do I get this to work. I mounted it in Daemon Tools and burned it to DVD with Nero. Then I installed it from the DVD without problems, but when I try to play the game I'm asked to insert the DVD alhough it's already in. Have I burned it the wrong way?"
,travlaxx,2006-01-07T02:27Z,"Listen up everybody! I need some help.
I have install ""The Movies"" but when I tried to start it, it asked for the dvd?.. How do I do to make this game work? I don't understand anything. Isn't the whole idea with downloading things, that you do it because you don't have the real thing? What I mean is that I don't have a cd or dvd or something.
Please help."
