This site would be significantly better if people like you knew how to keep their obviously malformed thoughts to themselves.
Remember folks: The internet is serious business!"
,TransRane,2008-11-15T10:59Z,"On a side note, have you ever considered the idea ""If it isn't broken, don't fix it""?
Nintendo can't decide what the hell they want their controllers to look like. Granted, I won't argue that their new concept is revolutionary indeed, however, that doesn't give you the right to go bitching at people for something you ever so clearly cannot wrap your limited capacity for thought around."

Tried drinking bleach? It's good for your brain... not mine though...

Burn to dvd-r like you would burn anything else. Not sure about gamecube, but wii is fine.

I don't mind the Playstation controller, but i find it boring that they haven't really changed it. Its comfortable and works... but i always got a huge thrill out of new controllers with new systems. Except for the xbox. That thing was a joke - and still is, they need to redo the shoulder buttons.
Wii controller makes me want to hit people - which i usually do.

For me its the gamecube controller. It was just so damn comfortable. "
