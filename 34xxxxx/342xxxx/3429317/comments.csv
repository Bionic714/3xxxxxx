So, I VBR'd it because it's much better quality that way (I used LAME encoder - user defined parameters, best quality:size ratio), plus it's tinier. Enjoy, and please seed."
,Rocklord_x,2006-01-09T01:00Z,HA HA! You've exposed my laziness at only checking a cuppla sites. I didn't say my search was thorough. The quality is excellent though. Perhaps I shouldn't have typed 'only' in caps...
