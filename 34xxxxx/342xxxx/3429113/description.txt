The purely educational information on this First Amendment protected website shows how Treasury Department lawyers deliberately changed the law over the years to make the truth harder and harder to find, robbing most Americans in the process. 

These websites have always been purely educational and do not tell anyone what to do.  Their purpose is to show the public the exact wording of the regulations under Subchapter N, Section 861 of the Internal Revenue Code.  
 
It is under 1.861-8 and 1.861-8T that the rules show when foreign income is taxable and when domestic income is taxable.  As you will see for yourself, for individuals, only income derived from international and possessions commerce is taxable.  If you have taxable income, then you must pay income taxes whether you like it or not.
