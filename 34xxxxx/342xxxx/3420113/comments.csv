,szucsati,2006-01-06T08:52Z,anyone has a working serial for the x86 enterprise edition?
,jakesnake001,2006-01-14T01:49Z,I've tried about 10 in the nfo file.  I suspect they've all been used.  Can't find a working anti-activation kill yet either.  Hopefully the nerds either make a key-gen or a working wpa_kill.exe.
