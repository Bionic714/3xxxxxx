,Kennyahk,2006-01-03T22:35Z,could you uppload the extras too ? ^^
,<<_HASHISH_>>,2006-01-04T16:36Z,"@@Suppedraken : by the way, i have only one question for you my friend. do you play guitar??????????..............i play, a lot, doin it since forever.....so i know where he sucks.........he sucks because all he does to show techical ability......but music isnt making tough runs or licks, its about harmony, making a melody which has the capability to haunt any given mind. petrucci, no doubt has achieved a lot in terms of technicality, but he aint a musician....like satriani....i hope you are satisfied....."
,Kennyahk,2006-01-04T17:18Z,I play guitar a lot  to and John Petrucci was amazing They all are =)
,cedemera,2006-01-05T10:06Z,How to burn these two diveded files?
,<<_HASHISH_>>,2006-01-05T12:04Z,"@@cedemera : just open those files with alcohol120% and then you can burn it. if you dont wanna burn it, just mount it on a virtual emulator. alcohol120% does it all...."
,mathsped,2006-01-05T22:10Z,Thanks for this one !!  If only someone could reseed G3 - Live in Denver as well...wishful thinking ? :-)
,cedemera,2006-01-05T22:32Z,Thanx Haschish! Now it worked out (even)better with Alcohol   ;-) Great performances all of them!!
,SicKn3sS,2006-01-07T21:17Z,why did you rip off the extras :( its still 4.3 gigs? plz up it with full extras untouched but compress with ratdvd (www.ratdvd.com) so it will only be about 1 or 2 gigs
,MusiCiouS,2006-01-10T22:59Z,now (not know :D)
,MusiCiouS,2006-01-10T23:00Z,Why doesnt it work.. I'm at 70% and know it says that the tracker cant find the torrent??
,SicKn3sS,2006-01-10T23:05Z,thepiratebay's tracker is moving so it may be down
,Snurf,2006-01-28T02:11Z,"Petrucci sucked? hehe, well you better get back to your cheap ass nylon guitar and practise some before you comment that"
,<<_HASHISH_>>,2006-01-29T21:30Z,"hahahahaha snurf and i am pretty sure that you are one those cheap,low-life, gullible pricks who believe whatever they are told ......so fucking shameful........and thats why you think that petrucci is amazing, i know what goes in your mind. it isnt worth more than 2 cents, and so is your attitude..........asswipe!!!!"
,EBMM,2006-02-02T07:18Z,"HASHISH you are a fucking idiot.Petrruci completely destroys Satch and Vai, no contest at all.Petrruci isn't only superior in technique but also with song writing.I am so sick and tired of Satch and Vai's shit.John Petrucci with or without Dream Theater is amazing.If you are trying to tell me Glasgow Kiss doesn't have a melody then you can just fuck right off, you are obviously an idiot.Shit, I didn't know anyone could be that fucking stupid.
Also it IS obvious you are a shitty guitarist, no real respectable guitarist would say ANYTHING like that about Petrucci.Hell, no one with musical taste would say that.Petrucci doesnt just try to show off his technique, that is retarded.He uses his technique tastefully.Spirit Carries On anybody?Of course that is only one example.

Anyway, I am not sure why I wasted my time replying to a troglodyte like you, youre obviously a complete idiot."
,SicKn3sS,2006-02-16T15:08Z,John Petrucci was awsome but he could probly of done way better
,LIAL,2006-02-23T00:07Z,"John Petrucci kicks ass!! John's technique is just unbelievable. (and I can say that becouse I have played guitar for 19 years!) Okay mayby Satriani has a little bit more intresting style, but NO ONE CAN SAY PETRUCCI SUCKS!!"
,<<_HASHISH_>>,2006-02-23T11:30Z,"@@EBMM, gotta say that you are very good in insulting, no competition to you . but absolutely you dont know anything bout music at all. so dont give me that crap you typed, you can piss off and say that glassglowkiss had a fuckin shit melody and whatever you wanna say, now i gotta say that you and petrucci both sucked. at everything"
,Misty Mountain,2006-02-26T03:51Z,im not here to insult you but i was just wondering why this says it'll take 2 weeks to DL?
,ryoutsu,2006-03-02T03:58Z,"Ok, I'm having a prolem. I click download, I've tried both open and download than open. My program, ABC opens it correctly and it connects and starts working, but their aren't an daa moving. it says it's 0.0% DL and 0.0% UL. Help..."
,haXman3,2006-03-06T12:08Z,"I have'nt got the movie yet, but I have the live music. My favourite guitarist is easily Satriani. He's got the hendrix touch! ;D PeAcE all u guys m/"
,Dare2share,2006-03-18T19:28Z,"Thanks for the upload. I am not playing guitar for 20 years so I can't judge and compare the qualities of these players. I only know that I like Satriani a lot and I am curious for this DVD. I wonder why people before me are pissing each other off, what's the point guys??!! Peace and respect."
,thirdeye,2006-04-05T03:11Z,"What the HELL? Hashish... what's wrong with you? I think Petrucci is awesome, you think he sucks, ok whatever! Who gives a shit. They're all good in their own way. For someone who upped this shit and who I assume is into prog metal, saying petrucci sucks is pretty dumb. But who cares, ok, you're awesome."
,Vaiable,2006-04-09T22:52Z,"This is an amazing dvd with amazing performances by all musicians onstage, including John Petrucci who probably deserves the brightest spotlight."
,Misty Mountain,2006-04-21T03:35Z,What do i use to play these?
,b_derdaca,2006-04-21T20:54Z,"I've been playing for 15 years and feel that Petrucci has more of a melodic groove than Satch or Vai! Let's hear you play Damage Control Hash, I bet you couldn't make it past the first solo. Don't get me wrong I love all three but nowadays everybody fills so much damn space on whammy drops and insane 
trills that I'm not impressed by the flashy bullshit 
squeels anymore. Anyone who puts down Petrucci should post their own shit and prove they are worthy of saying ANYTHING AT ALL except what a great show! Thx for the download anyways!"
,b_derdaca,2006-04-21T21:03Z,Anyone out there who has any live footage of GREG  HOWE please let me know. I would be sooo greatful!
,b_derdaca,2006-04-22T01:08Z,"I don't mean to curse anybody out but I hear so many guitar players attack other players when they can't play shit themselves! Personally I respect every player in every category, everybody has their own style. Personally I didn't care for Dream Theater but John is one hell of a player, just different from Satch and Vai."
,slawus4,2006-05-13T08:24Z,oco chodzi z tym HASHISH prosze napisac na maila slawus4@op.pl
,luusg,2008-07-30T10:15Z,"the last song 'Smoke On The Water' is not full, does anyone have the same when extract these file? I used Magic Iso Maker to extract theme hix."
,RReactor,2008-09-06T20:23Z,all three of those dudes are awsome i am a big petrucci fan myself dream theater is a kick ass band all the members are awsome in the group portnay is probably the best drummer in the world and john myung shredds on the bass
,cheborneck,2011-06-10T23:34Z,you should've just uploaded an .iso or at least the VIDEO_TS folder so people don't have to download extra software and try and figure out how to make it work.
