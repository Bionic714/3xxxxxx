This is day 2 with English audio.  The quality is a bit higher so the file size is up to 3 GB, which you can put on a dvd for backup :-)
It is 2 hours long, and 2147 Kbps,  29.970 fps,  720*416 (16:9),  XVID = XVID Mpeg-4,    Supported.

Give me some feedback, if you think I am going overboard on quality :-)

cheers!
