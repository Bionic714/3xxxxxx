ESPN NHL 2K5 (Xbox) 
Sega returns to the ice with ESPN NHL 2K5, bringing a whole suite of new features to its hockey sim. Party Mode lets players go up against each other in dozens of multiplayer mini-games and challenges. The new Contact Control shows off a completely redesigned fighting engine when the gloves come off, plus allows players to rough it up with better control of checks and aggressive defensive techniques. Online mode for both Xbox and PlayStation 2 feature depth in competition, with tournaments, detailed statistics, multiplayer league play, and even online Party mode. And for 2005, the ESPN presentation has been beefed up even more, with ESPN's Gary Thorne and Bill Clement presiding over all the action on and off the ice.
