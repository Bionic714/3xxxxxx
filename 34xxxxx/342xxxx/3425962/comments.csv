,pspaddict,2006-01-10T07:16Z,"Nearly 3,000 downloads and not one person can confirm weather or not it works on fastloader/UMD emulator. jeez."
,dracuger,2006-01-17T14:03Z,"Come on some one will it run on Fastloader or not? anyone? pspaddict post here if u find out, i'm gonna wait on downloading this i guess"
,spwans_freaky_ch,2006-01-23T11:57Z,"i've checked this out on all the forum and on http://pspiso.nachtvuur.nl/ and from what i found it ""WILL NOT"" work with any emu's up to date, so ppl, don't wast ur time downloading this!"
,Latex-hamsteri,2007-09-23T13:08Z,"lol, why won't you just get a custom firmware so you wouldn't have to play with your sucking emulators. it eases your pain a lot and you wouldn't have to care about comments like ""don't waste time downloading this"" you noob"
,airbugged,2008-05-29T11:32Z,"it turns off in the loading screen,.im already using 3.90 m33 custom firmware and put the settings to sony(holdR fter opening the psp) instead of m33 and it still doesnt work..anyone knows how to run dis game??"
