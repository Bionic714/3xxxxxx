Good Charlotte's Young and the Hopeless is punk-pop déjà vu. Rehashing worn clichés 

aplenty on each track, cuts such as "The Anthem" emerge exactly as the title overtly 

implies: a high-velocity, guitar-driven reason to lash out against the usual growing 

pains inflicted by parental authority and high-school drama. Grafting the widely 

recognizable drum motif from Iggy Pop's infamous "Lust for Life," "Lifestyles of the 

Rich & Famous" is downright predictable, while offerings including "Boys and Girls," 

"Day That I Die," and "Moving On" are strictly paint-by-numbers rockers sans 

personality. However, "Emotionaless," a shoegazing ballad with a clever orchestral 

backdrop, stands as the sole moment of truth. An album title that clearly reflects the 

content; stick with bands such as Green Day if radio-ready punk-pop is your 

preference.
