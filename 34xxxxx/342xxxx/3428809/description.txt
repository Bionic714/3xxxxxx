directory, run it and patch PExTNBPlugin.dll to remove online check/validating subscription. 

Note: before you are doing this part, you have to disconnect from internet, else it wont work.

Then start F-Secure, go to Home > Subscription Status > Change and use the keymaker to generate your serial number, after it is validated you may be prompted to reinstall F-Secure in order to activate subscription, do it and enjoy ;)      
                                                        
Btw - if your updates download way too slow change the protocol from polite to http in updates option.
