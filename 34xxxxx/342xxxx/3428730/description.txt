Shootyz Groove's fourth album advances the quintet's hard rockin', booty-knockin' hybrid of rock, hip-hop and rap with a distinct "Noo Yawk" flavor. This could be one record to drop on rocker friends who complain that rap involves no musicianship, because it's a guitar jamboree: "L Train" glides along crisp reggae tracks, while "You Have All Been Warned" and "Put Down The Mics" (whose message seems long overdue) boil over with furious fuzz-tones. "Mad For It" bustles like frantic Manhattan rush hour traffic, with a hard to resist fist-pumping chorus. There's also props tossed to "ol' skool" rappers ("Do You Remember") plus their first cover version, a toughened-up thumping of XTC's "Dear God" that sounds like Sir Mix-A-Lot backhanding Andy Partridge.
