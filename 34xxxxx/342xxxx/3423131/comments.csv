,ibutton,2011-04-16T17:29Z,"a/v 8/4, video has a ton of artifacts. Also, hardsubbed english. I'm not complaining, I know this is generously offered free of charge, just summarizing the product for fellow downloaders. As an art film, the video will be held to a higher standard and the amount of subtle color ramps used in this film require hellish encoding skillz to avoid artifacts. :P"
