,ineedfiles,2006-01-23T00:36Z,"I HAD NO LUCK MAKING THIS WORK!! IT JUST WASTED LIKE 3-4 HOURS OF MY TIME... MINUS THE DOWNLOAD.
i started to install then it said it couldnt read the disk, then it froze up when there was only 13 minutes left(after i made another copy) the serial worked fine tho.

,waykone1,2006-01-23T03:16Z,"Sometimes it looks like it stalls at 13 min but if you let it run it will finnish.

Please let me know if it works"

,Alezei,2006-02-26T20:25Z,do it works in finnish languafe?
,hackwojr,2006-09-19T10:36Z,"this is not sp2.  It installs fine but under system, it shows it as sp1.  I wish I would have none this sooner since I need an sp2 copy to install on my MAC.  I tried slipstreaming my own copy but I get a usbehci.sys error.  This is killing me."
