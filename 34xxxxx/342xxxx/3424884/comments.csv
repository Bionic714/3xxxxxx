,the_drake,2006-10-07T23:42Z,How do you extract the FLAC-files??
,red_vespa,2007-09-04T20:30Z,"You extract the .flac-files by using a software called ""Xilisoft"" , which can be found here on ThePirateBay. Xilisoft works good in Vista ( Ultimate ) , and it seems that it does not contain any viruses. I have checked that thing by scanning Xilisoft with Kaspersky antivirus."

,Geinstein,2010-03-28T16:25Z,"@ the-drake - You *don't* extract FLAC files! Just use a media player that supports this lovely lossless & open audio format. Use f.i. MediaMonkey, it's free!"
