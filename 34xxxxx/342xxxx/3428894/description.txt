
Dive on the Wreck from the Swedish roll-on-roll-off ferry fully loaded with 108 trailers and trucks, regustered to carry up to 140 passengers. She sunk on her maiden voyage to Cyprus in 7 June 1980 off  Larnaca's fishing harbor. Zenobia is now lying on her side at  42 meters.  She has two decks, and two stern doors (1 port, 1 starboard) , powered by two 7 cylinder,  single acting, oil-fired two strokes engines. They delivered 18,760 bhp. She sank outside Larnaca's fishing harbour at 2:30 am on Saturday the 7th of June 1980. Her history and the intrigue over her sinking deserve an article on their own but to give you  an idea the rumours range  from computer error and insurance scams to Middle Eastern security forces. 
The most popular theory though surrounds her computerized ballasting system, as this reportedly developed a fault while on route to Larnaca. A maintenance team was sent aboard to correct the problem and successfully managed to correct the list to 5┬░. However, at 5pm on the evening of the 6th June 1980 the Captain mistakenly dismissed them, dispatching them back to land. This was later to prove to be a fatal mistake as the following day  at 2am she sank, taking her cargo to her final resting place...
