,ergot,2008-06-29T03:31Z,"Is this the theatrical version, or Orson Wells' director's cut?  There are like 76 changes between the two versions, and I would prefer to get another copy of the director's cut if possible (mine is a VHS TVrip and is messed up during the climactic final scene).

Thanks for the up!"

,BillyBob_junior,2009-11-14T21:27Z,This version is longer than the original version and is in perfect sync with subtitles from the director's cut. So this must be the director's cut.
