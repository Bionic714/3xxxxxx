,bob1029,2006-01-06T09:54Z,Whoever submitted this has no clue how DVD-A works... the cppm protection makes it impossible to copy out the lpcm 24 bit audio track using standard imaging tools.  What you listen to when you download this is simply the ac3 track built into the vob file.  this is only about 980 megs.  the other 7 GIGS are completely wasted.  decrypt the aob files and resubmit this...
