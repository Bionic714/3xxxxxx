,ninjalinus,2006-03-22T02:48Z,"This is the case, i have 1 hd, but they are already separeted, one 149gb, and the other also in 149gb..

but now i want to move over some from the 1st hd (where i have windows) and on the other, i have files that i wanna save.. 

can i just move over some free space from the 1st hd over to the 2nd without need to format any of them?"

forgot that question.. my bad. =)"
