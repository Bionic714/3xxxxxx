You guys just need to download and install the latest Divx codec pack. There are several floating out there...just google it. "
,shaquille111,2008-10-02T16:50Z,"hi.

,scorp8888,2008-10-18T22:36Z,"After downloading 4.7gb of files, I get nothing.

Nothing can play them, not on a mac, linux or windows box, all with codecs a plenty..."
,scorp8888,2008-10-18T22:50Z,"I like others had problems to start with playing.
Check your download directory, my completed torrents, which were moved caused a problem, the unmoved downloaded ones were FINE!

Torrent is GOOD!"
,hvm,2008-11-15T17:03Z,"Yep, it's a good torrent and a great show. Don't let it die, it deserves an audience. And if I could donate or something to BBC I probably would."
,Helmer2,2009-01-04T22:29Z,Thanks a million. Great show and a superb performance by Christopher Eccleston as The Doctor.
,majca,2009-03-13T02:32Z,Good quality.  +1

,m0rdant,2010-01-14T15:58Z,"I'm just wondering if there is a copy of episode one ""Rose"" that does not have the weird extra sound bites - there's one of e a cheering audience at 3:44 min, and again at 5:08 just some random person talking.  I don't know if it continues through the episode - it's like another station was coming in when it was being recorded.  I've downed it from 3 different torrents but it appears each of them used the same source."
,creffield,2011-03-29T08:33Z,"THIS IS THE WORST!!  On EVERY fucking copy of the first episode ""Rose"" there is a ""cheering crowd"" and someone actually TALKING over the episode.. What a fucking joke this is!!!!"
,creffield,2011-03-29T08:36Z,"Futhermore, NO ONE has done ANYTHING about correcting it either, what a bunch of cocksucking LAMES!!! (You happy with shit? then EAT IT!!!)"
,mcilvenna95,2011-04-24T07:16Z,"really slow download, at 4.2 kb/s"
,dufy,2011-05-27T09:54Z,"here is the 1st episode (Rose) with no sound problems.
