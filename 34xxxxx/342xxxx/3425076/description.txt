HILARIOUS - YOUNG POET READING, LEAKED BY MISTAKE - MUST SEE!

Bird
Feathers as red as the leaves
descending
from the trees in the
deep and
desolate forest a 
cardinal
so beautiful and
free soaring
through the bright
blue yonder
no clouds in sight
just the
smell of pine in 
the glimmering snow
below.
