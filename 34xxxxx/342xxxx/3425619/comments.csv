,vinryk,2006-01-08T11:39Z,"Trust me : we are not idiots. 
My PS2 is set to English and always has been.
This is not a multi-5 but the French version."
,MariusMal,2006-01-08T20:28Z,"i wasnt calling you an idiot i was just asking because it happened to me once and i didnt know about that multi auto select feature.
