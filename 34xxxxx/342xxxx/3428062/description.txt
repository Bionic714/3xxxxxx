Snakebite: In Search of the King Cobra....it was shown on Animal Planet.

Snake Expert, Austin Stevens, features in this pacy, heart-stopping Documentary as we follow him on his brave quest to find a massive King Cobra deep in the forests along the coast of South West India.

No other snake grows to the size of the King Cobra, but they are shy and reclusive moving quietly and leaving no trace. Hugging the Arabian Sea, Austin ventures for days off the beaten track, along the way he finds other species of Cobra including the beautiful but formidable Spectacled Cobra and makes it dance by using his hands.

However the King of all Snakes remains elusive. Eventually, with Austin near to giving up, it is a shed snakeskin that gives him his breakthrough. Sure enough a twenty year old, fifteen foot King Cobra is not far away and this documentary shows incredible footage of Austin handling the deadly beast and even managing to achieve his life long goal of touching a wild King Cobra on the back of its head. I hope you guys will enjoy this brilliant video. Thanks for all your encouragement for my previous posts. Thanks for all those guys who shared the burden of seeding and hope will do that again.
