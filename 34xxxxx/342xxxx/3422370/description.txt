               One step after the other ? that is how we are
               moving on in life. That famous"first step" is
               often the most difficult one ? but also the
               most important one. To take it, you
               definitely need some courage and also an idea
               what direction it is to lead you to. our
               steps leave a number of different footprints
               on the ground we are walking on, traces on
               our lives and on the lives of others. Each
               step, each trace is unique ? just like the
               people leaving such traces.

               The 16 quite different compositions on this
               cd are meant to be musical steps leading
               towards harmony. Because harmony is very
               important to me in my life. For some of you
               it may be possible to follow my steps to find
               harmony for a while. I wish my compositions
               could leave some traces ? just like
               footprints in the sand!
