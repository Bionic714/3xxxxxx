,Rakinite,2007-03-25T15:15Z,You're not supposed to choke leechers. No download allowed = no seed.

,dayannaf2,2007-08-21T01:59Z,"um hi, i have a serious problem, i've finished downloading and installed the game as soon as i pressed start game it says please insert disc 2, over and over again.. I INSERTED IT!! what do i do?"
,MaidNanako,2007-08-27T17:54Z,Insert disc 2 and then open windows explorer. Select disc 2 and there will be a folder named Crack. Inside it will be the gamefile (it's named sonic). Just copy that and paste it into the original folder (C:\program Files\Sega\Sonic Adventure DX by default) and overwrite the original one. And then it'll work
,adhdyoshi,2007-10-18T02:26Z,"Very nice torrent, I'll be sure to seed once its done because the torrent seems to be wanting seeders XD"
,MasterMario9,2007-10-27T01:23Z,"Wait,do i need two discs?And split the bin and cue files with each?Im confused!Someone please tell me!"

,narutomaaan,2008-03-25T17:56Z,"works perfect!! :D 
Here is a guide how to install and play it. I will translate it to english and swedish. 
English:
1. Download this.
2. Download alchohol 120 % 
http://www.snabbstart.com/download/alcohol-120
3. Burn cd1 with alchohol 120% (use a cd-r disk)
4.Download deamon tools
http://www.snabbstart.com/download/daemon-tools
5. Put the cd disk in your coumputer and install the game.
6. Use deamon tools to continue the install.
How to use deamon tools: when you installed deamon tools a lightning icon will appear down the in the activityfield, where u can see the clock. Right click the mouse and the icon and click Virtuell CD/DVD-ROM -> unit :0 -> mount image then the folder with all the sonic files. Choose cd2. The install will  continue installing. 
7.When the install is finished put the cd-disk in your coumputer (if u dont already have it in) and  go to start -> this coumputer -> then right click the sonic DX disc 1 and click explore -> then you will see a crack folder click it -> copy the crack and go to start -> this coumputer -> (C:) -> program or program files -> sega ->sonicadventuredx ->paste the crack and click yes.
8.Now start the game and enjoy =D
OBS! If you turn off the coumputer and boot it again and the game doesn´t work, look back at step 6.
swedish:
1. Ladda ner 
2. Ladda ner alcohol 120 %http://www.snabbstart.com/download/alcohol-120
3. Bränn cd1 med alchohol 120% (bränn med cd-r)
4.Ladda ner deamon tools http://www.snabbstart.com/download/daemon-tools
5.Sätt i den brända skivan i i datorn och installera.
6.Använd deamon tools för att fortsätta installationen. 
Hur man använder deamon tools: när du laddat ner och installerat deamon tools kommer du se en liten blixt längst ner i  högra hörnet vid klockan. Höger klicka på den, sedan klickar du följande virtuell CD/DVD-ROM -> enhet 0: -> mounta image -> sedan väljer du mappen med sonic grejerna och väljer cd2. Installationen kommer att forsätta.
7. När installationen är färdig ska du sätta i cd-skivan som du brännt (om du inte redan har den i) och gå in på start -> den här datorn -> sonic DX disc 1 -> utforska -> sedan ser du en fil som heter crack. Kopiera den. Gå till start-> den här datorn -> (C:) -> program eller program filer -> sega -> sonicadventuredx -> klistra in cracket och klicka yes.
8. Starta spelet och spela =D

OBS! Om du har stängt av datorn och och du sätter på den och startar spelet och om de inte funkar,gå till steg 6 och kolla igen.

,Ironnoobx3,2008-06-03T19:00Z,"Yes I have a Big Prob I cannot burn the Din File Because I do not Have enough Disc Space, Is there a way to Compress then Burn or AM I Missing something"
,narutomaaan,2008-07-03T00:54Z,It will become smaller when you do burn it. It did for me
,narutomaaan,2008-07-27T14:01Z,I think you can use Ultra ISO too

,shohoku10,2009-01-10T16:05Z,"here's a step by step tutorial on how to install this.
1)using UltraISO extract out the folder called 'crack' from CD1 to somewhere like ur desktop.
2)use daemon tools to mount the CD1 (.bin).
3)install it and when ask for disc 2 mount the CD2 and continue to install.
4)after done do not play the game and instead open the 'crack' folder u will see an application.
5)go to program files sega and copy and replace the application in the 'crack' folder into tt sega folder.
6)u r ready to play."
,sonicwarrior,2009-07-14T00:41Z,"I have a problem:
wrogn cd: please insert the original cd

can u help me"
,pajic23,2011-02-12T12:12Z,"When you crack a game, you need to mount cd2 and run game it should work"
,Lixifer,2011-03-07T05:52Z,"I wont install a major program just to be able to run this game.  (I.e alcohol 120% or Daemon tools)

Thanks anyway."
,Lixifer,2011-03-07T05:57Z,"In the future perhaps you could make the files into .iso or .img files and save people huge trouble.

Don't get me wrong - I very much appreciate anyone who makes the effort to upload games and apps and such!

Just sayin'."
,Oizumi3,2011-04-04T22:52Z,"@Lixifer
You, are retarded. Alcohol 120% is not a major program first of all. Secondly, it's EXTREMELY useful. If you torrent games constantly, then you'd want a .iso mounter/virtual drive anyway because a lot of games can only be installed by using one."
,imag197,2011-09-28T01:22Z,"@Lixifer 
Don't assume that everyone who makes these files wants to take the time to make a direct play for you. Either be grateful or don't download it."
,moooka,2011-10-26T18:52Z,Is there a no CD crack?
,moooka,2011-10-26T18:57Z,And thank you for the upload
,Pepenews,2012-07-02T03:39Z,I'm still installing but from what I read in comments looks like it will be fine. Also the game is awesome! I spent hours of my childhood just playing this game on dreamcast.
,Pepenews,2012-07-02T03:47Z,Tryed game already. It's working awesomly but I had to download Deamon Tools because Power ISO is not compatible with .bin nor .cue files.
