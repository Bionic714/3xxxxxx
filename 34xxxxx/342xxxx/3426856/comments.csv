,Net_roamer,2006-01-03T08:36Z,"how do you get the game to work? i installed it, but when i try to play it, it keeps saying insert the correct cd?"
,RENI,2006-01-03T08:43Z,"And...I failed to start the game.It keeps telling me ""Original disc could not be found or authenticated"".I'm using Daemon Tools V4 and all the emulation options are enabled.
The A-Ray Scanner reported SecuROM DVD detected on the NW_DIAMOND."
,Net_roamer,2006-01-03T10:22Z,"i figured it out...install the 1.66 version. Then it works...at least, when i opened it with sd4hide it did..."
,RENI,2006-01-03T10:59Z,I think it is already 1.66 after you install the Diamond edition....

,RENI,2006-01-04T06:40Z,"Emmm,there is already a 1.66 patch in the DVD,I've installed it,and the Securom was gone.
BTW,maybe Chikara didn't make the image properly,so it can't pass the copy protection check."
,sgtneo,2006-01-04T16:42Z,Unfortunately the key provided for Hordes of the Underdark is no good. :

You can also find cracks on http://gameburnworld.com/"

,nightspydk,2006-02-08T04:33Z,"@Jamina

Get Daemon tools.
http://www.daemon-tools.cc/dtcc/announcements.php
Install that and mount the .ISO by right clicking the taskbar lightning bolt icon.
There is also help available for Daemon if you look for it."

Download the 1.69 patch, it's called the ""Critical update"" on bioware's website.  I'm too lazy to post the URL but I can assure that you won't be wasting your time; I can verify that patch 1.69 does allow you to play NWN:Diamond on Vista."
