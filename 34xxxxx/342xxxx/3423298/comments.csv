,Lindoff,2006-01-03T13:07Z,ratinaz: Lägger du upp de 2 sista?
,Peracer,2006-01-03T18:31Z,"japp,  jag väntar också ...
och önskar också alla Farscape älskare en trevlig 13-dagshelg som kommer nu snart ..."
,Son Of Mogh,2006-01-04T19:15Z,"Hey, I do not understand french, could you guys tell us what is going on in english, did anyone hear anything new from ratinaz? Is he able to seed the last two discs anytime soon? Thnx."
,darkcell,2006-01-04T23:30Z,"Son Of Mogh, these guys are just wondering about 409 and 410, just like you (and me and everybody else).  I guess we all just have to be patient until ratinaz has had his server moved. Anyone like to help out with 306 while we wait? It's the only one I haven't got yet. I'd be eternally grateful ..."
,mceuser,2006-01-05T03:39Z,"Jadda jadda, jeg får vel starte 306 så lenge da!:P"
,darkcell,2006-01-06T09:44Z,Thanks mceuser and everybody else. I now have the complete third season and will seed for any other stragglers. Thanks again.
,ratinaz,2006-01-07T16:39Z,"Hi gays. Will seed 409 and 10 starting 2006-01-09. On monday. I dont have season 2, sorry."
,rernst,2008-11-12T05:34Z,"Forget all these 'untouched' torrents. I have a super high speed connection and have been waiting for days for this idiot to emerge and seed. He's probably sitting there and grinning while the rest of us try to download a single byte.

Haha, yes, he managed to waste my time."
