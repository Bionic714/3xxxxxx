R: Racing Evolution (Xbox) 


Namco's new racing title for next generation consoles GameCube, PlayStation 2, and Xbox, takes a decidedly different approach to the company's former arcade style racing games. Realistic racing simulation is the name of the game in R: Racing Evolutions, where players can customize fully licensed cars, and race in eleven fictional and real-life tracks. Four main game modes include Time Attack, Arcade Mode, Vs Mode, and the new story driven Racing Life Mode. Compete in eight different race types such as Circuit, Rally and Drag racing. Put the pressure on competing drivers with the innovative new Interactive Driver AI System, which uses a pressure gauge to recreate the battle of nerves on the racetrack.
