,ChokeUntilDead,2006-01-14T03:35Z,"iif it's an iso and there is a proplem like the one guy suggests, would mounting it in daemon tools fix it??"
,lagger,2006-01-14T23:37Z,not an iso so no problem 
,reapur,2006-01-16T19:27Z,"guys,
how do you install the state with this download?
thanks"
,reapur,2006-01-16T19:28Z,"oops, sorry.
Just run it the first time and it will ask you for the state that you want."
,boycali01,2006-01-31T08:43Z,thank you. how about the premier version? what is the different?
,HumbleGod,2006-02-03T08:51Z,"See the Turbo Tax website for differences between this and Premier (which is now also available on TPB). Basically it's more useful for small businesses, investments, rental properties, etc, IIRC."
,jewllzs,2006-02-26T05:46Z,"Does antone have turbo tax for years 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004 ?

If so could you please upload them...Thanks"
,scooter786,2006-04-01T17:01Z,"Is there any registration or serial number required with its installation and is it ""ok"" to efile?"
,tornadosturnmeon,2007-01-11T16:24Z,Ive noticed that premier is avaiable but is searchable under turbotax (one word instead of two). Will definately be giving back a alittle love since this saved me around $150 for not having to purchase yrs 04&05.  Thanks

,2rep,2007-10-10T01:04Z,"FYI - I found out the hard way, turbo tax is NOT backwards compatible!!! i.e. if you want to use TT06 to open up a saved file from 05....... NO GOOD! I really Need an 2001 version...... anybody?"
,wuch5454,2008-03-30T17:53Z,Please seeed. Thanks!
,soccerdad,2008-08-12T21:44Z,I also am looking for an old version of Turbo Tax Premier for 2002...  Anyone have that?
,soZexy,2009-04-10T21:35Z,"@ 2rep: yea, Intuit does that to force people to buy their stuff every year. They were doing it on Quicken too and it pissed a lot of people off. Not sure if they still do it on Quicken but it wouldn't surprise me."
,halafax92342,2010-03-16T04:12Z,Can someone please seed this.
