,reivax,2006-04-11T14:16Z,génial !!! depuis le temps que je les cherchais ! promis je seed après les avoir dl pour en faire profiter tout le monde de ce DA géniallissime!
,azaghal,2006-06-26T16:35Z,my god... i've been looking for it for a few years. it was a fukin cult cartoon back in the 80'ties - one of the few western shows that was aired on state television
,Skvettlapp,2006-07-10T01:59Z,"Great! Now only to find some usable subtitles...or try to learn french...again.
I remembert that i ""fell in love"" with Arkana as a kid. That white tight suit with and stuff....first woman i ever loved was a cartoon :P

Ill probably be seeding this on and off for a while."
,asp4dos,2007-01-04T23:26Z,"j'peux pas assez remercier fubar99 pour ce DA. je ne croyais plus de reussir le retrouver sur le net. svp seed ce torrent afin que je le prends, car je m'occuperai de le fournir aux autres apres.
je ne savais pas que le dub originel etait en Francais. il fait longtemps depuis la derniere fois que j'ai utilise cette langue, mais c'est mieux que la version Anglaise que j'ai suivi sur Cartoon Network en 1995.

PS. si vous aimez les DA science-fiction et aussi romantiques, je vous recommends l'un de mes torrents ici http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3554598/Hi_no_tori_2772_-_Ai_no_kosumozon_(Phoenix_Firebird)_(1980)



well, I can't thank fubar99 enough for this one. I had almost lost hope of finding these wonderful cartoons on the internet. please seed them untill I can download, cause I will seed for quite some time afterwards.
I didn't know the original dub was in French, but it sounds better than the English version I had seen in 1995 on Cartoon Network. of course it's not much fun unless you're fluent in French...

,HackerName,2007-04-22T15:21Z,Subtitles?
,biui,2007-10-26T17:10Z,"very nice, thanks!!
and if anyone can help in seeding it would be better..."
,Nexus6000,2008-01-05T08:56Z,"If someone could sit down and make subtitles in english to this serie, it would be really really nice :)"
,Dalej,2008-03-28T23:07Z,"Heh, I remember this being aired in Poland when I was a kid too.
This Arkana wasn't my ""first love"" though...
It was this chick from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Once_Upon_a_Time..._Space

Heh heh...

I'll DL it and seed, hope someone finds subtitles in english."
,aocid,2010-04-15T08:58Z,"I promise I will make subtitles for this!!

,helldray,2010-06-20T22:58Z,Just want to say I've created an account here specifically so I can say how glad I am to find this and that I'm looking forward to subtitles!
,spell6ound,2010-10-09T22:46Z,Great upload! Anyone has had any luck with the subtitles?
