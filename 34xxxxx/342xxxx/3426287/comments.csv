,Ravara,2008-05-24T05:52Z,"Could we please have more seeders? I don't seem to be connecting to any, and I'm connected to ONE peer. Needless to say, this may take a while... if I'm even able to complete the download at all. The original Wild Arms is one of my comfort games from my childhood, and I'd like to check this version out. "
,Guiraud,2008-12-13T21:26Z,"This is for all who ask for seeds, after finishing download, seed too. ItÂ´s easy to ask for seeds while is downloadind and then delet the file from the computer couse already burn a DVD with it.

Think About"
,mikeysama,2009-07-20T01:50Z,"Game was originally a DVD9, so what was removed/downsampled/etc to make it fit on a regular DVD?"
,dreamchaser89,2011-03-29T00:21Z,"Thanks for the upload, i just finished downloading it, thank you very much again :), i was looking for it long time ago, and now i finally have it and i'm going to try to run it on an emulator and visit my old friends of Filgaia :) I will seed it too, so people, don't lose the hope!
