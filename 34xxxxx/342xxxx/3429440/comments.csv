,count0nz,2007-09-25T05:00Z,"Hi all, Well i seen you guys need this Game seeding so i am seeding the copy i downloaded via ISOHUNT

.. Can anyone confirm this game is working on Vista/XP..

When installing on XP or Vista the game starts installing but once it is at 100% on RANDCAMP.RES it sits there takeing 100% of the CPU.. has anyone else had this problem??

It has to be the same version as this torrent becose the torrent checked ok 100%

I have Tryed installing with 98/ME Compatable anyone else have any suggestions?

I'll seed this for a few days or so to help :)

Take care everyone.

,ptracie,2007-10-02T21:19Z,"Hey count0nz and anyone else,
Did you ever get this to work on XP?  I've tried lots of suggestions, including downloading a patch from 

http://hotel.jowood.de/main.php?rid=335〈=en

Without the patch, the game loads (when mounted using Daemon) but crashed to desktop when trying to start a campaign.  With the patch, it doesn't recognize the mounted CD.  

Any suggestions out there?

Thanks!
ptracie"

,Fayidar,2012-04-25T01:35Z,"Running Win Vista x32 SP2.  I mounted the game iso and installed it without a problem, but decided to run the dt347.exe before trying to run it, since I assumed this program was the crack.  The first time I restarted the computer after this install, however, I got a bsod, even on Safe Mode or Last Known Good Configuration.  After many attempts to fix it, I plugged in a USB DVD drive I happened to have, and this allowed it to start.  When Windows booted, I got a warning that Daemon Tools is not compatible with my version of Windows.  I can only assume it was trying to start up a virtual drive, and failing, and blue screening my computer.  So, beware, Vista users!"
