Hoahio is a female project that was founded by Haco, vocalist and composer for both Happiness Proof and After Dinner.

Hoahio's work consists half of composed pieces and half of improvisations, and contains elements of a wide variety of genres (punk, minimalism, ethnic, techno, pop, noise, ambient), all of which are cooked up instantly with the unique Hoahio flavor to create a new musical vocabulary from their skewed understanding and nearly fake renditions of a variety of sources.

Haco: vocals, electronic percussion and bass (1, 2, 6, 7, 9), electric mandolin (1, 2, 8), synthesizer (2), samplers (1, 10), Moroccan drum (3), guitar (9)
Michiyo Yagi: kotos, 20- and 17-string (4), voice (1, 2)
Sachiko M: samplers, piezo microphone with effects (4), trigger synthesizer (2), voice (1, 2, 6)
