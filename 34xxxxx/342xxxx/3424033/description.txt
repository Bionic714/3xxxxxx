This torrent replaces the earlier one I submitted which had incorrect artist information retrieved from the online database, I have manually edited the artist for track 15 onwards as it previously had Arthur Baker as artist.

Anyway enjoy, I see alot of people calling stuff like 2pac old school lmao.  2Pac maybe old school to you but Afrika Bambaataa is my idea of true old school.
