These are two albums by me (mortes) that I created over the past 2-3 years. Anyone has the priveledge to distribute these cds freely and as often as you like as long as you keep my moniker (name) along with the file. If you have any questions contact me on aim at t4pyro (sn)


cd1: mortes - meaningful subtleness
cd2: mortes - codependent noise


peace be with you
