,nutter123,2006-01-04T23:45Z,How do you use these? I unzipped and got a tonne of *.GEN files......not sure if you gotta convert or your allowed to use them on a emulator or whatever
,UFOz2,2006-01-05T04:12Z,look up the Gens Emulator on google... those roms will work for it... Note that this set os part of a great whole... look up GoodGen or GRH on here to find the bigger chunk... this is just a torrent i generated for my fellow collectors....

,UFOz2,2006-01-07T00:05Z,Yeah look around on EFnet or UnitedUsers or if you get news access check out abem... there's still 1 rom presently as i tyoe this thats being hoarded...
