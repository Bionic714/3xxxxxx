,kornykova,2006-01-09T12:23Z,"thx 4 the upload but i cannot get it to work :(
I get
error extracting support files
the specified module could not be found
help plz! ... don't know what i'm doing wrong (using daemon)"
,rezovor,2006-01-09T18:27Z,"It's version 1.03 (the latest)

@korny - You do not need to use deamon tools, after you install there is a ""v1.03 No CD"" which you extract to your sim golf folder which overwrites the old simgolf.exe (this is so you can play without a cd) 

if you're still having problems, let me know."
,rezovor,2006-01-09T19:48Z,"You can try creating a new folder and extracting the iso to it (like a zip). Then clicking on setup.exe to install - Is anyone else having problems installing? I'll check it out later on tonight.

If you continue to have trouble - visit the forum I just threw together

,rezovor,2006-01-23T20:21Z,I responded to you on the forum.
,rezovor,2006-03-29T03:19Z,"I just wanted to clear up some confusion on behalf of my nfo. It says ""Self-Extracting Zip"", which I was incorrect about and was thinking of another program at that time. The Simgolf is an ISO, so please mount with your favorite tool, install, then copy the crack into the sim golf folder."

thnx for the torrent and the guide"
,nfs13,2008-12-31T17:22Z,The download went great. But i get the same problem as earlier... run the golf.exe; it starts; the screen turns blue and starts turning into white and yellow (kinda like a screensaver); but i can ear the game sound starting (company intros and game menus). It should be something with the graphics adapter... any help?
