,Kalper,2006-01-03T10:15Z,"A no cd/dvd crack for Starforce?  I haven't heard of a crack being released especially for this.  I must admit I have doubts.  I'll test it out (IF a seed comes back in, 80.9% is pretty boring) but I'll be virus scanning this crack."
,Kalper,2006-01-03T15:25Z,"Woohoo, it works with the iTWINS release.   Thanks Redman3000!"
,Mad Mobeus,2006-01-03T15:34Z,"This is incredible. Thanx guys.  I've been waiting a long time for this one... 

I will be seeding this one for the whole day."
,lazerustheduck,2006-01-03T18:04Z,"Thanks for the seed, not sure it was worth it, think the graphics have gone down hill since terror from the deep."
,Redman3000,2006-01-03T18:40Z,"That's the problem with today's games... 3D != Better... I love games like X-COM UFO Defence and Terror from the Deep, but every X-COM game after that was horrible IMHO. I have not tried Aftershock yet, but I read reviews and I don't think it will surpass the first X-COM for me... At least they tried, and perhaps they will meake it better with Afterlight..."
,IceDeathBoy,2006-01-08T11:01Z,Hope this game is so good as they say... Thanks
