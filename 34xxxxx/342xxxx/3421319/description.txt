John Peel Punk Special, December 10, 1976 (Remaster)


Peel devotes a program to the emerging punk rock movement. Session guests: The Damned.

MP3, 192Kbps
Duration: 1 hour approx.

N.B. The version of this I received had the track markers in odd places and the middle of the Pere Ubu track "Final Solution" missing, presumably because of a tape flip. This version is my attempt to put the trackmarkers in reasonably logical places, and to reinstate the full version of "Final Solution".

No Peel links were harmed in the making of this reconstruction.
