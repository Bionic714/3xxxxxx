,kam2004,2006-01-07T04:41Z,"By the way, I don't know why it was said this is crap quality.  I previewed it, and it looks good to me.  The show is a total of 800+ MiB.  The picture looked pretty clear, not grainy or anything else.  I'm thankful for what I can get, living abroad, I have no other options.  Keep on seeding!  Thanks bugi6"
