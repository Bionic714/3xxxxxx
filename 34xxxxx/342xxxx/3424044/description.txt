Everything from the DVD is here but the working menus, although I added screenshots of them. The chapters menus aren't on this because the XviD has no chapters, but the show isn't missing.

The match vs RVD is an Easter Egg on the DVD.  There was no visible link to it so you had to select "Lillian thinks about..." in the "All the Extras" menu and press left twice to watch it.

The NFO.HTML file contains links to all the downloaded files you can click that change color once visited.

Thanks again to Redmer for the DVD-9 Source!
