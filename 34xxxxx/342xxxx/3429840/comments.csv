,leonidd,2006-03-05T15:59Z,Crap. Buy The original - Nick cave instead.
,psyphon,2006-03-27T22:04Z,"Everyone just ignore the egghead, im sure nick cave would agree on with me on that. Download cat power and buy her albums, she deservs it. "
,yo_mama,2007-08-11T01:14Z,nick cave's just pure crap.
,Wafna,2008-01-05T00:13Z,it's apples and oranges.  Nick Cave and Cat Power are both excellent in their own rights.  DL or buy 'em both.
