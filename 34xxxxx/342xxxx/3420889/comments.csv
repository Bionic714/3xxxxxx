,Tall and Dark,2007-07-19T19:30Z,"Sorry, part of comment got cut off, I meant a dial-up user like me."
,WSimons,2007-09-07T00:57Z,I'd appreciate it very much if someone seeded this.  Or pointed me in the direction of an alternate torrent for it.

,lugosus,2008-12-08T12:41Z,thanks for uploading this. there is a full version on youtube and yes it needs subtitles. the dialogue is quite funny
,traxtenberg,2009-05-18T23:16Z,"lugosus, dialogue is not only funny, but also very meaningful. It is a really complicated task to properly translate film like this into another language"
,im77perth,2011-08-03T21:32Z,"Thank you for the upload. 
I first saw this in a soviet cinema in 1987 and it's wonderful to be able to re-visit it again so many years later. 
Many of the original words and expressions have now become part of Russian slang. E.g., the made-up word ""Gravitsapa"" (literally means: ""gravi-grabber"") has become a slang word for ""motor vehicle"". 

Now to the bad part. 
Russian is my first language. The subtitles in this version are APPALLING. The translator's command of BOTH languages seems painfully poor. So many nuances have been overlooked that it renders the whole thing quite embarrassing, really. 
I must disagree with the previous speaker. 
99% of the dialogue in the film translates into English perfectly well. However, at least half of the charm and humour is lost in this dreadful, half-baked translation. What a pity. "
