This is a proper version, previous had subtitles named incorrectly.

Kin-Dza-Dza is something like an "advanced cyberpunk film". It's a lot about people and social structures which on "Plyuk" of course have many parallels to our society. It's a very funny movie, but it's also a melancholic movie with great philosophical sense.
