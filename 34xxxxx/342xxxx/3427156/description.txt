Sevas Tra stands for "art saves," a philosophy written all over 

Otep's debut full-length, an album that yanks itself from the jaws 

of suffering with rage, anger, doom, and a sound heavier than 

Slipknot. Female lead singer Otep, whose name is an Egyptian suffix 

meaning "creative offerings," growls, screams, and throws in the 

occasional hip-hop sound ("Battle Ready" and "Sacrilege") as she 

wipes the slate clean of any preconceptions of how intense a 

female-fronted metal band could be. Marilyn Manson has said, "That 

girl scares me," of Otep, not surprising when you hear the eerie, 

pained opening of "Emtee" or frightening whine of "Blood Pigs." 

Sevas Tra is a record that raises the high watermark for goth metal.
