,infernalburn00,2008-02-16T17:16Z,"Everything uninstalled right, windowed mode this, fiddle with graphics settings that, resolution those hardware 3d blah blah...... Everything i seem to try fails to get rid of THE BLACK SCREEN OF DEATH..... when the game goes to start up, all that happens is a black screen, no intro no menu no nothing. Any suggestions would be nice, but like i said, i've already tried alot of the usual stuff"
