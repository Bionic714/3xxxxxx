For cracking, you need to download another torrent, see the link http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3297289/MS_Office_for_Mac_2004_Serial_Crack#filelistContainer;  copy the crack file OfficePID into the folder application/ms office 2004/office. then start to launcher any product(word, excel, powerpoint etc.) with any problem."

,stupidmetoo,2007-11-30T07:15Z,"This worked beautifully for me today.  and i have leopard!  thought i'd run into problems, but all was well.

details:  after you install, google ""show hidden files in leopard mac"" and you'll get instructions on how to show hidden files.  then just delete/replace the existing OfficePID file with the one in the crack that athaxili suggests.  then run all the updates, otherwise you'll get a Microsoft Framework library"" error (at least i did until i ran the updates).  good luck!"

,KILMOVES,2008-05-11T00:15Z,"Showing Hidden Files on MAC OS X

1. The easy way:

To show hidden files, just download and run this app.
To hide them again, download and run this app.
(Word of warning: Both these applications relaunch the Finder. So make sure you don't have any applications running, otherwise everything works just fine)

2. A little more geeky way:

To show hidden files and folders in Finder, open a terminal window and type this:

defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles TRUE

(the above sentence is all in one line), press return, and then type:

killall Finder
(and press return)

Finder will relaunch and you will be able to see hidden files and folders.

To revert (hide hidden items), type this in terminal:

defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles FALSE

(all in one line again), press return, and then this:

killall Finder
(and press return)
That's it!"
