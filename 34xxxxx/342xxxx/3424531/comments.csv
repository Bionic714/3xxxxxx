,dinja,2006-04-08T23:00Z,"downloaded the game and installed it following the instructions. the game starts nicely, lists the credits and the paradox company intro, but then shuts down with the message: ""runtime error! this application has requested the Runtime to terminate it in an unusal way...""
any ideas what to do?"

,xazax,2007-11-19T13:34Z,"I also get the ""Microsoft Visual C++ runtime error""

Am I doing someting wrong or is it the release thats borked? 

Tested the install on both Win 2000 and WinXp via vmware... Maybe it's problems w/ virtualisation?

Anyone? 

Googling the error says nothing really... "
