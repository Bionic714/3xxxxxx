A contraversial book looking into both The Bible and The Qur'an on a background of findings of modern science. It tries to answer some question, some of which: Is any of them still valid or not? Did science come with or against what they metioned hundreds of years ago as (words of The Lord)? Does religion as a whole contradict with science or not?

It is realy a very smart book that deserves reading.
