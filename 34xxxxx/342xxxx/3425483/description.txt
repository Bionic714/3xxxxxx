When Madonna appeared on The Late Show With David Letterman in March 1994, her coarse language, including thirteen uses of the word "fuck", made the episode the most censored in American network television talk show history. It also resulted in some of the highest ratings of Letterman's late-night career.

Madonna's language and behavior ? provocative, seemingly random at times, peppered with four-letter words, full of crude double entendres, and ending with a refusal to leave the set ? caused a public controversy.

The Federal Communications Commission received numerous complaints, echoing Letterman's remarks that "people don't want strong language in their homes on late night". Both Letterman and Madonna were to later publicly regret the appearance.


Picture quality is quite bad, and it's jerky, but you can see and hear everything. Trust me - it's worth the download!
