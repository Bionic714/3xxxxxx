,Suensyan,2006-02-05T22:01Z,What is password?
[V],Holm,2006-02-06T20:46Z,"Sorry my bad, the password was to be found hidden behind some german: "" frechdachs "" is the password. Note: Only the patchfiles are password protected. Because the game won't work if you install them. Uhm, that's what it said. "

,shootme86,2007-12-02T21:41Z,how do i register? or how do i get it to work?
,telesien,2008-06-30T14:25Z,"it is actually easily possible to patch this game. just install it, IMIDETALY patch it, and after that use the keygen to generate new key. works 100% for me.
btw. this is an awsome game. a firend of mine, who studies engineering, uses it for some of his projects :)"
,motzu,2008-08-05T16:44Z,asd
,vinnieolle,2008-10-25T20:29Z,"Doesnt work, im not seeding. The install and registration all work fine but when you try to play the game, you can't get past the menu page. I don't know what the keygen is for because the serial and registration info is in a readme. The keygen is probably a virus."
,Talac,2008-10-26T07:33Z,"1) d/load and unpack
2) run .exe application
3) exit program
4) copy Patch and Keygen to installation folder
5) run Patch
6) run Keygen
7) run pfx2.exe application
8) enjoy"
,centox,2009-01-14T00:23Z,"Hmm, the game stops at the meny.

,agtrier,2009-02-22T15:33Z,Fake. Can't get further than the menu.
,DM88,2009-02-28T01:20Z,for those who can't get past the main menu!!! DO NOT INSTALL THE PATCH!!! it screws up the game!!!
