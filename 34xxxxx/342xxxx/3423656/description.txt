MViDs #01

Compiled by AssMaster and encoded with NeroVision, 
complete with animated menus.

This is a compilation with some of my music
videos I had on my harddrive. Most of them were
svcd (good quality), some of them were vcd (bad
quality), and collected from DC & The Pirate Bay
among others.

If you're a regular pirate bay visitor you may
recognize some of them :)

Video: MPEG-2 ~4 mbps, PAL 4:3 Aspect Ratio
Audio: MPEG-2 224 kbps 48 kHz Stereo

All packed in a wonderful DVD-R =)

Credits: All mvid scene groups, The Pirate Bay,
         Rosa Mannen (tack f÷r alla sk÷na musik-
         videos!)

Don't forget to keep seeding this for a while,
I have only about 40 kbps upstream, so I can't
keep on seeding forever!
Sharing is caring :)

Burn with Alcohol 120% or mount with Daemon Tools
and view with dvd player of your choice.

Merry X-mas 2005! // AssMaster
