for singing success?"
,doc-z,2006-02-14T10:15Z,Would be great if anyone could upload the DVD as well! I will seed if someone uploads it!
,apoch2005,2006-02-16T06:51Z,"I don't have the DVD, but reports are it's pretty useless. My advice is listen to technique discs before listening to disc 3; that's pretty much what the DVD will tell you. Disc 3 is also quite limited and very Amero-centric. How many ways do you want to hear the US national anthem. "
,apoch2005,2006-02-16T06:54Z,The report is also says the DVD is very short and is more an ego trip for mister manning plus a re-hash of the stuff in the PDF file. I'd be happy if someone would prove the reports to be wrong by uploading the disc as DVD-R
,apoch2005,2006-02-16T16:51Z,Sorry - meant listen to the Technique discs (3 - 5) before listening to disc 2.
,arex1337,2006-04-09T09:59Z,"Very nice lessons. If anyone finds a dvd or dvdrip, TELL ME!"

,riell234,2006-11-17T17:25Z,Has anyone here experienced any good results from Singing Success?
,whorehouse,2006-11-18T13:10Z,"I got this ages ago also from torrent, maybe even this one but i extracted all the files with win rar then delted the rar files so i wont be a ble to seed unfortunately. However, i can honestly say this course is amazing. I dont know if it will work for you but it has done wonders for my voice - added loads to my range and improved my strength of voice and i dont even use it properly. I just do odd days on it when i can be arsed. So ye this is awesome"
,lua,2007-01-22T17:26Z,"very awesome. i'd like to see the DVD though.

i'll keep seeding for a while (it's at 1.8 right now)."
,silenceisgolden,2007-04-19T04:41Z,"it'd be a miracle if someone could seed this for a few weeks, i know many people want it, including me"
,rukusaki,2007-08-01T06:38Z,"Shame, shame, shame on all of you. Apoch, you're a weasel. You're right about one thing - this is considered one of the best programs on learning to sing and indeed, truly is. But, you know, it IS the best because of all the hard work and sacrifice it took to make this program. Yes, this IS personal. I know Brett, extremely well. He is a dear friend and incredible teacher. I, myself, have worked on this project and have enjoyed the fruits of its hard labor. And, I'm pissed as hell you all don't have the decency to pay a few pennies for what this program is truly worth. If you don't get anything out of it, the accountability lies with YOU. And, please spare us the whining when you didn't even pay for the program. As for the rest of you who DO like the program, you accompany masses of satisfied paying customers. So, here I sit on a soap box and point my angry finger; but, from someone who makes a living in this business, I reiterate that music and instruction like this should not be free. Pirating, as this sleazy website promotes, is the scum of the Earth. ARGH!"
,whorehouse,2007-10-03T22:15Z,"Rukusaki, so what you're implying is that you made an account with this site just to have a go at us then? Because if you didnt and you have downloaded anything AT ALL using bittorrent or any other method of acquiring copyrighted material without paying then you are being a complete hypocrite. The singing success program is expensive and although knowing now that it is worth every penny and i would be very surprised that even you yourself would be willing to take a risk with so much money on something made by someone you dont know and boasting such amazing results. "

,whorehouse,2008-03-16T21:11Z,hey you will need to download winrar from somewhere. You can usually get free trials if you just search on google. Other than that you might need to have a look around this site for it ;) that will extract the files for you. hope this helps. 
,diceyboy,2008-03-19T16:09Z,"Hi I just finished torrenting this program last night and I was really looking forward to using this program! I want to accomplish my dream of becoming a singer and I really was planning on using this the morning I woke up. Unfortunately, the program was in a file that was unknown to me and I have absolutely no idea how to open it. Can someone give me a complete elaboration of how to open this file or something? Some said it's a .rar file, but it's not for me and I cannot extract it. PLEASE help."
,diceyboy,2008-03-20T07:00Z,x_x Aww man. I was waiting for a reply from someone for about the whole day. I really want to use this program to pursue my dreams.. I really want to become a singer. I have potential and I know I can do it. I really hope someone can help me out here....
,diceyboy,2008-03-21T05:40Z,"Hey, uh, guys. Sorry for overexaggerating before. I re-torrented and I received a .rar file. I'm sorry for the multiple comments. But thank you to whoever concerned about it! Thank you to Apoch for the torrent download. "

,IAmAnon,2008-12-11T07:45Z,"Excellent excellent torrent. Thank you very much apoch. Thanks. 


Regarding .rar files, not only can you use WinRAR, but you can also use 7-zip to extract the files. 

7-zip is free open source software.

Thanks again apoch. "

I don't know if Seth Riggs minds that Brett Manning has used his work and is calling it his own."

is it possible that you could put those along the audiobook in the torrent please? i would thank you forever if you did
thanks again, and if you cant get the workbook its all right, you helped me a lot anyway srsly"
,alainfigue,2009-07-11T23:46Z,"For anyone that's having problems with downloading this torrent with lime wire.I don't really know why but it seems to be a problem. Try using micro torrent, It worked for me and i think i'll be using this  program from now on. hope this helps."

,chaucerchris,2009-10-20T02:35Z,"Afte searching and looking at many programs to download on torrent sites that teach you to sing, Brett Manning?s Singing success systematic Vocal Training program in my humble opinion is one of the better ones. I can well understand why so many people are desperate to get their hands on this program. 

Yes I did download this torrent from another site, and for a while did use it but decided that I wanted my very own copy complete with all twelve discs, supplement Instructional DVD and instruction book. So yes, in the end I decided to buy it from Brett?s website. I am not saying any of this becuase I think people are wrong for downloading from torrent sites but becasue I felt that in some way I might be missing something that was perhaps in the bought original and also felt that Brett really does deserve the credit for a superb and fantastic program. At the end of the day it was a personal choice. And again I am not saying this in judgement of other people. I say good luck to you. 

I do have to say however that those of you who have been trying to get the instructional DVD that comes with this it is not the same as the one currently going around as that copy is a demo is nothing like and does not contain anything to that on the original instructional DVD so in that respect people getting the torrent are missing out because the DVD is fantastic and really does compliment all the exersices on the lesson discs and gives you so much more. Now that I have bought this I can?t tell you how excited and enjoyable it is to have your very own copy of this great program. The other benefit I have found is that I am more motivated to using this program than I was. I live in the UK so the program in money when converted from 199 us dollors works out around ÂŁ124 and if you do decide after having and using the torrent to buy it then it?s well worth paying the extra for Express International Shipping becuase after ordering this it arrived at my home within 24 hours. That?s how good the service is. 

I will advise that when using this program you really mustn?t try to rush through the lessons that start on dics 3 with lesson one and onto the next. And to not to just move onto one exercise onto another to the end. Practice doing each exercise at least four or five times to master it and to become comfrotable before moving on. I find that I can comfortably do the exercises in each lesson for 4 hours a day for four days aweek resting my voice on the Sunday and Monday, starting again on the Tuesday. Listen to the instructions from Brett and to not sing higher than you comfortable do so. It?s a learning process so relax and enjoy. It really does work and already after four weeks of doing lesson one and now starting lesson two the quality of my speaking voice has begun to change and boy can I hit some high notes. I can tell you that when you do get to doing lesson 3 some very exciting things will start to happen with your voice. I just had to have a sneak preview. 

Best wishes"
[V],cezen,2010-02-18T20:28Z,Super fast DL speeds... Go the whole thing in less than 20 min.  
[V],cezen,2010-02-24T20:07Z,"Well, I can see why some folks don't like it.  If you have NO musical training, the first 2 CD's are a must.  They define choral, vocal and musical terms that you will need to be famliar with to use the program. 

The only thing I found missing from this torrent, was the DVD that comes with the set.  It can be located

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5274078/Brett_Manning_s_Mastering_Mix_12_CDs___DVD

I would personally only select the DVD from the above torrent, but from what I have read and listened to on my DL, the DVD is important for some techniques."

That means that Technique Lesson #3 - the one Brett Manning stresses as very important - is missing completely. I've been through every single file and cannot find the lesson at all. 

Is it possible to get that lesson re-uploaded? Thanks! So happy to have this!"
