Correctly working Xored Trainer System for Xbox with all updated trainers as of 12-25-05 
by AcidReign.

Just FTP the "Xored 2.0" folder to whichever drive you store your Xbox trainers on (E, F, or G).

These are trainers that ONLY run with Xored, some only with Xored 2.0.

I've noticed most people can't get Xored 2.1 working, But this version 2.0 works, and is FTP'ed straight from my Xbox.

For newer, updated trainers (for Xored and EvolutionX) go to http://trainers.maxconsole.net/

To get Xored working on hard drive installed games, you must edit the Xored.ini file to correct where your games are installed.
