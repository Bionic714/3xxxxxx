This is a SuDoku program written solely by yours truly.
It creates and solves both standard and samurai SuDoku puzzles, and has been bug free for three months.
The program has an extremly intuitive interface using simply the two mouse buttons and the numbers on the keyboard or a toolbar on screen.
