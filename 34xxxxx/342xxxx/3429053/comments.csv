,papa_haydn,2006-07-01T08:05Z,"Thanks so much for sharing all this rare dark ambient.  I love Inade's Crackling of the Anonymous, ever since hearing it I've had to buy as much Inade as I could find, and download the rest.

Thanks again.  ;)"

,SeedsGalore,2007-08-21T06:11Z,"Seed, please!!"
,RagingFiresofChaos,2008-04-18T23:48Z,96.7% completed!  For the love of Dark Ambient please seed!  Let's all keep these amazing torrents alive!
,dilbertgeg,2009-05-03T22:36Z,"I've found that 96.7% means Tracks # 1, 3, 7, 12, and 13 are missing tiny bits.  If I rename them by putting .mp3 after .!ut (incomplete), all tracks play with hardly a noticeable glitch.  (After all, while it is the coolest dark ambient I've ever heard, it's not like words get garbled by the missing bits.

Winamp skips right over the glitches like nothing.  Less problem than a scratch on a CD.

I do wish dnjago would come back and fix it, but it's still ok for a free sample.  (I purchased about 5 other Inade CDs on my Bank of America credit card which that debt is soon going bye bye."
