,Blue_World,2010-02-20T15:35Z,"For all of you that gets the invalid key when you try to play online. You need to play on a cracked server! Here is one 100/100Mbit from sweden
83.233.17.165:16567
on this server you can play with invalid or valid keys! 

För er som talar svenska så har jag altså lagt upp en crackad server i sverige på 100/100 Mbit.
Anslut er på 83.233.17.165:16567 så ska de funka bra =)"
