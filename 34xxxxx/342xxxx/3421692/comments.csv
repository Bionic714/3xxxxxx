,WiwuX,2006-02-15T09:45Z,"OK, installing it would be great, except I don't know what file to mount in order to do so. I've tried all of the files in the RAR file already."
,ChvyVele,2006-02-20T06:42Z,"How do you install the game? There's just a bunch of files like .r00, .r01, .r02, and so on. Then there's the crack folder, patch folder, extras folder, and all that junk, so where's the .iso to mount, or the .exe to install? Or what other method is needed to install this?"
,eeehlo,2006-03-02T18:36Z,"you have to use like winrar.
the files need to be extracted."
,NoseMan79,2006-03-11T12:22Z,"Does this one work in XP with DX9 ?

Superb game, I just don't want to make 98 multiboot of this comp just to play it."
,waagaawoo,2006-05-01T00:52Z,All the .rar's have the same labled contents. If i try to unzip more than one it try's to delete the first. What should i do?
,Daemonlark,2006-05-14T00:09Z,"I tried to install this, but I get a message that I cannot install this on Windows NT (I use Windows 2000, btw).  How do I get it to work right?"
,Daemonlark,2006-05-14T00:26Z,"Nevermind, I got it.

For anyone else that cares, mount the IMG and run SETUP.EXE with the parameter -lgntforce."
,neckbeard,2006-05-28T22:37Z,"Alright, I'm pretty stupid since I can't get this to work.  Anyone feel like telling me how?  Whenever I try to run the .rev file it says I don't have permission to run the freaking file.

I think it's because my computer thinks I'm too stupid to run the file and I'll somehow hurt myself by running it.

Help?"

,Korrupted,2006-08-13T06:47Z,"after having pressed new game, and after the intro, the game freezes and i get this message;

Error: Direct3d device driver does not accurately report texture memory usage.
Contact you 3d accelarator vendor for updated drivers.

what should i do?"
,eelco,2006-08-21T03:32Z,"Thanks Darksnow.
One problem though: the game doesnt continue after the training missions. Not on my winxp comp anyway. "
,Dogbert99,2006-08-21T04:51Z,"Korrupted, it means you need to update your drivers. Assuming you have a Windows XP comp, go to the control panel, then system, then click on hardware, and go to device manager. There, you can update your drives. The process takes a while though."
,eelco,2006-08-21T22:31Z,"And this is the error I get:

error: buff len of 80 exceeded by 80: station.dif
c:\documents and settings\administrator\local settings\temp\$$$power\

any great ideas ?

Thanks !!"
,Fatality101,2006-08-28T03:48Z,"ao..

Yo I had the exact same error message as you, but I got the game to work now...

I just opened the cut scenes folder and changed the ""opens with"" properties of the cut scenes from WMP to DivX player. Now the game works perfectly (so far lol).

I have a fairly old pc with XP pro and tried everything else but it didn't work. I didn't have to do anything else but change that ""opens with"" thing in the end, no compatability or nopthing...Hope it works for you."
,jessy503,2007-09-01T00:52Z,ok i click on install.. and then it just freezes then it exits... help!
,geothermal,2008-10-22T18:32Z,Someone for the love of god seed! I have 2.7% to go come on!!!
