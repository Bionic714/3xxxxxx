Stubbs the Zombie in "Rebel without a Pulse" (Xbox) 


In this game, players take on the role of the rebel himself - Stubbs, a wisecracking Zombie who takes on an ultra-modern city of the future using nothing but his own carcass and the weapons of his possessed enemies. Developed by former members of Bungie Studios members and utilizing the Halo 2 engine, Stubbs the Zombie delivers a stirring tale of one man's hunger for love, justice...and brains.
