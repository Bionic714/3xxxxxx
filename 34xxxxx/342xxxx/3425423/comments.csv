,pelle busemann,2006-12-19T09:12Z,"I had sound problems aswell, but i found out:
If you start the game from your dashboard you will get no sound.  Game must autoboot.
reboot xbox from dashboard , or turn xbox off then on. (with dvd in dvd drive ofcourse)
Seeing the other comments herer, I guess this depends
on what kind of xbox modchip you have.
