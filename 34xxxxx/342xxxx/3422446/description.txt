If you are looking for a good mix of old & new music, full of love and positive vibes then this is for you. It contains funk, disco, reggea, some R&B and dance songs. Most of them are ripped at 192 Kbps, some at lower speeds but still of good audible quality. A special word of thanks to KIFRADIO.COM for putting a name to those really old disco songs from begin 80ties.
