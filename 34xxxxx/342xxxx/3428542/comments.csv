,SomeGuy2005,2006-01-11T19:13Z,"Heyy GEnius, the whole point of having a crack is that u don't need to mount the CD everytime u want to play the game, which menas u don't have to have lot's of images on your HD"
,-[ToXiC]-,2006-01-13T00:22Z,Can someone seed pls
,thesommelier,2006-01-14T01:11Z,i burned it and it works fine-- old game
,thesommelier,2006-01-14T01:12Z,"i downloaded it but it won't mount with daemon tools. I deperately want to play this game and would pay $ for a copy. Anyways, has any1 gotten it to work?"
,-[ToXiC]-,2006-01-14T01:52Z,"it worked for me. But i have a problem with the latest patch. After instaling the patch i canot start the game. It's asking for some word from the manual. Any help????
I would also apriciate if someone can upload Diablo I, i would like to play it"
,Skyl3lazer,2006-01-14T23:23Z,"I'll get Diablo 1 probably by Monday, since people want it. As for patches, which I had never even known about (been a while since I've played), I never got a manual with it...
Try it w/o the patch i guess...
as for the daemon problem, i don't know about how daemontools works. if it emulates a CD drive, then it should be fine, but if that does not work just get alcohol 120%. It's the best i've seen so far, and it works for me."
,Termix-,2006-01-23T20:05Z,please seed!
,Linde12,2006-07-15T02:46Z,"Must i burn a cd to play it?
plz tell me"
,Linde12,2006-07-15T02:48Z,när jag testar o install kommer det sån här det här programmet kunde inte starta eftersom storm.dll inte kunde hittas. det här problemet kanske kan rättas till genom att du installerar om programmet.:(
,Bosanek,2007-01-18T12:34Z,"Just one question: Why is this torrent so large (540MB)? Is it because yours Warcraft CD is a Mixed-Mode (Data + Audio)? So you've made a RAW (BIN+CUE) image of it?

It confuses me because I have also had Warcraft once I and it was only a couple of megabytes in size."

,manuelv2,2011-10-08T05:09Z,"few things to know. l2mount. if you don't like the warcraft ost don't play it. if you do l2mount. this is the cd re-release, i think, version 1.22h."

,Zuphos,2012-06-08T18:04Z,"I was kind of wondering how this was going to work without dosbox but it works anyways! thanks alot skyl3blazer! awesome torrent 

for people who cant figure it out 

1-DL
2-Mount
3-explore the virtual drive
4-double click install
5-select your options ( you will have to mess around with the sound ones a bit to find a compatible setting since no one has any of those old cards anymore .. i hope xD)
6-go to were ever you installed the game and double click WAR and the game should start just fine :D"
