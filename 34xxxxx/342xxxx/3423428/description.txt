This project is the culmination of MANY hours of labor. It is a reprise of a Daily show best of I made last year. I decided to do it again this year.

The final DVD is almost 6 hours and to squeeze it into this I really had to compress it too much. It was orginally 2 DVDs. So I am sorry about the quality.

This DVD Covers Nov 1 2004 thru Nov 8, 2005.

These are mostly clips of Jon, but there are pieces from each correspondent as well. They are all just what I thought was funniest. The entire file is about 6 hours long (you try to cut out bits from a year's worth of TDS - it's HARD!)


Enjoy, and please SEED!

thanks,
