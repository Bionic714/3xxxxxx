,Hop,2006-01-03T05:48Z,GREATEST. MOVIE. EVER.
,fakanof,2006-04-18T22:55Z,"Hop: What a crack of shit you are. You are either a fanatic turk or know jack shit about humor.

Wait, I actually think you are both since turks are known well with no understanding of humor.

The best movie is ""The Man Who Saved the World From ""Turkish Star Wars"" Types"" if you know what I mean you brainless shit head."
,albatorsk,2006-04-22T21:06Z,"I agree with Hop.

Nothing more to say, really."
,InfectedEye,2006-09-25T21:14Z,"It seems to be a turkish movie. How fun could it be? Screw this. Turkish movie, pfft ..."
,Donnie0,2006-09-28T18:34Z,Is something wrong with my computer or sound really doesn't follow video. Does anyone else have the same problem; please help;-)!
,FaderAbraham,2006-11-07T05:42Z,"I downloaded this and watched it a few months back. It was awful, and I'm really happy you shared it with us! "

,jonandk,2006-11-27T02:11Z,I've been looking for this for ages! Thanks man!
,neweyesopen,2007-02-28T07:10Z,This movie is a classic and funny as all hell.  I have not seen this anywhere!
,f_2_o,2007-04-03T02:39Z,"Thanx trasman.. This was hilarious! I've never heard about this movie before, I was nearly shittin'my pants! 

HEy fakanof, you racist scum! Go get a life you son of a bitch! "
,f_2_o,2007-04-03T02:45Z,"Also, 4 the ones who interested other international versions, I recommend to go to "" http://winterson.com/2005/06/episode-iii-backstroke-of-west.html "" and see the Chinese subtitled version of the Revenge of The Sith ;)"
,toppdogg91,2007-09-03T03:52Z,"fakanof im going to save the world from your ignorant ass. it's supposed to be a goofy movie but apparently you dont have the intelligence to figure it out. dont ever talk unless you are spoken to.
trasman thanks for the movie"
[T],splattergod,2007-10-13T22:19Z,"This movie is a blast...
Equal parts Al Adamson and Ed Wood jr..
Chock full of action and more action.

Make sure to check out the Turkish version of Star Trek, Spiderman, and Tarzan, as well.

And no, I don't see these as a true representation of Turkish cinema any more than I would consider the Backstreet Boys a representation of American music...
nor is Ule Bowles a representative of German (or any other) cinema.

Most can tell the difference between quickie cash-ins and real cinema....
So relax, and enjoy....
It's still better than tripe like Who's My Caddy or Glitter. "
,the wall of death,2008-01-19T03:55Z,great film 
,sam322,2008-01-23T09:08Z,"sounds good, thx!"
,kingazzak,2008-01-29T15:57Z,"trasman, thx
fakanof ""the man who saved the world"" IS this torrent. Now as for Turkish ppl having no sense of humour, maybe you are just not funny... "
,tofusoldier,2009-02-12T10:13Z,"@fakanof: WE ALL THINK YOU'RE A WANKER, haha. I'm not even Turkish and I'm offended by your racist stereotypes.  Go stick a flag up your ass."
,Shalamanov,2010-01-22T11:51Z,"This movie is really funny.  However, if you are racist, don NOT download, it is not funny for racist scums...."
,drd2112,2010-02-21T22:02Z,it would be really nice if somebody could seed this amazing movie...
,drd2112,2010-02-21T22:18Z,"thank you for seeding so quickly! im currently at ~50kbps dl, thanks so much!"
,Illog,2011-01-13T11:53Z,"Seeding with 25kb at your disposal.

Its a great laugh!!"
,laned130,2011-10-10T23:55Z,Is there any chance someone can donate some more bandwidth to this torrent? I've added the PublicBT tracker to my list but still only see 5 seeds and I'm only getting 2.5kbps down atm. I'll be seeding to 1000% when it finally arrives.
,laned130,2011-10-13T03:29Z,"Arrived much quicker than expected :-D
60kBps at your disposal."
,Zstar,2012-02-11T03:52Z,"wow, idk what people are trolling about its not like video editing was easy back then nor was it going to be an option if they were too cheap to make their own footage let alone their own sound track"
,spopes232,2012-07-29T22:40Z,It's FUNNY. Get over it!
