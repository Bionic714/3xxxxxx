As if you could fit 16 Morricone tracks to 18MB.
This just has to be crappy quality. I mean, gees, even Morricone himself would be pissed if he saw this..."
,eyerock,2006-01-22T00:29Z,WT* is this? 18MB and 16 songs? Made for playing on a Vic64 or Spectrum??? 2-bit and recorded at 8KHz?
,cmc.leviathan,2006-03-09T03:06Z,"WTF!! do you read?? This are PIANO ARRANGEMENTS!! not the songs for LISTEN, they are to PLAY PIANO...

ennio talked in my dreams and said: ""Kill this mother fu...r"""
,Maoxx,2006-10-08T02:12Z,"Mother fu...er? What a weird thing to say, even in a dream. Do you think he was suffering from aphasia or something?"
,Maoxx,2006-10-08T02:14Z,Or Mother Fur. That's some pretty fucked up symbolicism right there- perhaps he's alluding to the God Mother's Fur. You should run that by a psychotherapist to see if you're prone to killing and/or fucking your parents.
