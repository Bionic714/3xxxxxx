Everything from the DVD is here but the working menus, although I added screenshots of them. Everything but the main feature is XviD, MP3: 160 kbps, 512x384, & 2-pass.

"Get to the Point" which is something you can see on the main menu is a menu itself with a listing of the chapters of the video.
 
The nfo.html file include has an HTML version of these listings and the listing are links which open the video (if you downloaded it).  The links you visit turn dark blue.

Thanks again to Redmer for the DVD-5 (PAL) source!
