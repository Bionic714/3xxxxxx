Files transfered from CD, don't have the original files like in the last torrent! But the files on CD are the original files! That means files not in original bitrate. Now all in mp3 (Lame version 3.96, VBR ~ 200 kbps).

Hope all who don't have this or didn't have opportunety  to download all the last time, no could have all of this! Enjoy!
