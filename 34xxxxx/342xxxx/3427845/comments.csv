,tokyowars,2006-01-05T08:51Z,Your missing their first album: a 300 print self titled Canada only release....I think released sometime in the early nineties? Maybe 1990? A
,tokyowars,2006-01-05T08:53Z,"Whoops! Pressed the wrong key! 
Anyway, I have been after this album ever since I heard about it during their tour for TRIPtych. If anyone out there has a copy I'm sure there would be a lot of grateful people...."
,indesto,2006-01-05T19:36Z,"I check their discography up on http://www.teaparty.com/ , splendor solis is first album ."
,tokyowars,2006-01-06T03:40Z,"Yeah the other one is an EP. I don't think they consider it their finest work so may not be proud of it. The lead singer mentioned it in an interview during the tour as a passing reference, and I also met some fans at the concert who had heard of its existence, though it appears to be as hard as the holy grail to obtain!"
,tokyowars,2006-01-06T03:43Z,"From the bio section of the site you referenced: ""1991 - The Tea Party release their first album independently. The self-titled debut was mainly distributed throughout Ontario and all 3500 original pressings sold out within a year.""
I got the release number wrong but this proves it's out there somewhere..."
,tokyowars,2006-01-15T12:13Z,"I'm guessing no response mean no one has it. A shame, I really would have liked to have had a listen....:("

,linerror,2007-01-23T07:40Z,"Why did you NORMALIZE tracks?!  So nice when what should be a smooth drop to silence is still at 100% volume, only more an more distorted as it's amplified MORE AND MORE...

,UnchosenOne,2007-10-21T14:54Z,Tea Party independent album is available on another tracker. you've got to google for it.
,slash182,2008-01-16T02:07Z,"I have the original Indie album release for the tea party.  Its really raw, but not bad.  I'll try and put it up"
,Ardinia,2008-02-05T05:40Z,"The Tea Party was their first album, but it was independently released around Toronto Canada in 1990 or so.  The master tapes were damaged in a flood, and unusable.  Jeff said that they will never try and restore them and re-release it."
