,Rob.exe,2006-01-03T03:37Z,"Are you sure?! i downloaded an ""activation patch"" last time and after 30 days the hell broke loose at my computer.. so this dll file will not just ignore the activation shit but also ""register"" it, right? so i do not need to reinstall Windows Xp again..?"
,rawcorn1,2006-01-03T20:35Z,The attached .dll file is from Aug 2005 and will not work with MS Genuine Validation check.
