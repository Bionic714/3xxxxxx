,Oberbefel,2006-10-13T08:57Z,"First of all...

Great job to the Reloaded team,no problems with your work of art ^^

Second,you can't install any addon on a cracked game...

So,to install this addon on your already cracked DoW you have to reinstall DoW,then install DoW Winter Assault and after that crack'em both...

Easy?

Well,if you can't do anything this easy,then you shouldn't be downloading,just go and buy the damn game."

honestly people seed so others can download the game too"
,Eliwoodyyy,2009-02-03T23:56Z,"cant the instructions be abit more detailed?
unrar to iso so you actually make the disc then mount it with DAEMON and run??
i dont know... im unrar'ing it now so lets see"
,KyleOnBoard,2009-05-04T18:46Z,"for everyone that is having the same problem as i did, saying that you are trying to update the wrong version (or whatever) when you try to install its because you need to patch it from 1.01 to 1.4 (dont matter about patching it to 1.5) so it can merge with the expansion here is a link to a site that you can download the patches from (on patch 1.2 as well i had to run it as administrator). 

http://www.strategyinformer.com/pc/patches/warhammer40000dawnofwar/patch.html

Also people having problem setting it up.

1) download UnRar if you havent got it and daemon tools aswell

2) select all files from the first folder when you open it apart from the very bottom one that is a .sfv file (DONT SELECT IT!)

3) right click the selected folders and chose extract files, (i made a folder to extract them to) or you can just save time and click extract here.

4) mount the file to daemon tools that is NOT A CUE TYPE and the install shield will commence  :)

5) after its installed DO NOT START THE GAME, go to you game directory (my computer --> local disk C --> program files --> THQ --> Winter Assault) ("
,KyleOnBoard,2009-05-04T18:52Z,"CONTINUEING FROM LAST COMMENT 

thats what it looks like on my computer, now once this file is open minimize it, and open up the files on disc 1, there you will find a crack file, open the file and look for the green symbol called W40kWA and copy and paste it to the file you just minimized, when the option pops up that this file already exist COPY AND REPLACE, now once thats done create a shortcut from that crack symbol that should now be in the other folder to your desktop as you need to launch the game from the crack.

NOW HAVE FUN PLAYING!"
,KyleOnBoard,2009-05-05T02:52Z,"UPDATE

sorry dont select winter assault in the directory it already gets installed into your original DoW directory, copy and replace both cracks in the Winter Assault over, yes the green one and the red skull one. Also people having problems installing the patch 1.10 saying its corrupt or whatever re-install the original DoW, and it doesnt matter about replacing the original Crack just use the crack in the winter assault file."
,cypherm211,2010-01-12T00:55Z,i really hate when ppl ask stupid ass questions .. all the info you need is there .. great job RELOADED keep up the good work 
,fleetkid,2010-03-31T12:31Z,"Thanks a lot. works fine. :-)

,bluegriffon,2011-04-23T17:45Z,"ok I dl'd this the other day, Un rar'd it and used magic disk to mount the .bin file.  I wasn't asked for serial number and it never asked for CD2 however, I do get a message telling me that the .msi file is invalid. what to do?  I have had no problems with other reloaded programs"
,rudraaeneas,2011-12-10T09:35Z,"Could not install!! It keep asking for CD2 but i have already mounted CD2. Is that something wrong in CD2, plz help!!!"
,Strakos,2012-06-18T14:02Z,"Extracted like user ""KyleOnBoard"" led, but with DAEMON Tools Lite i see only the .cue file. So i used Magic disc and i see both files, .cue and .bin, but when mount the .bin file, the start menu of Winter Assault shows me, like ""Play The Game"", ""Readme"" etc, and cant play the game, ofc. Why the Installshield pop-up DO NOT APPEAR, only that shitty game menu screen?!"
,MatejSK,2012-08-19T14:12Z,"I reinstalled basic DoW with no patches and such. WA's authentification passed OK but then when the installation should begin, it says ""Installation ended prematurely because of an error"" and I get it every time I try to install this expansion. Anyone can help me? Or is there some really working Winter Assault?"
