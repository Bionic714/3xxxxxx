,klondike49uk,2006-01-06T01:01Z,"Someone requested a serial for v1.01 before the comments disappeared, this one worked for me:
SN = D-337-MDH-151-QGO-343-ETN-170-RBD-TYJ "
,dome-of-the rock,2006-01-07T15:11Z,thanks for the new serial... I couldn' t believe that Aperture stopped working after the update. I thought the guys over at Apple were some cool dudes... I'm deeply disappointed now
,.steen.,2006-01-10T01:07Z,"okey, this might be a stupid question. but is it possible to get this to work on a pc?"

,pediddle,2006-03-01T22:10Z,".steen, to get to work on a PC you'd have to hack the new OS-X for intel, don't know if anybody's done that yet.  Then you'd have to wait for the next version of Aperture to come out later this month since 1.0 won't work on Intel.

It will never work on Windows."
,killpanda,2006-04-16T21:39Z,"Well osx does run on a pc, cause i'm doing it. You have to have aperture 1.1 for it to run on an intel mac. So someone find that and throw it on here please!"
,tallkrogen,2006-04-19T22:48Z,"Universal binary for Intel macs?
Or not?"
,tallkrogen,2006-04-23T12:13Z,"Hey klondike49uk !
How did you get a pass. that
works with the 1.1 update for Intel Macs?"
,checche,2006-04-29T20:19Z,"Hello,
Have anyone find a Serial for aperture 1.1 universal binary?"
,FrankVespuci,2006-05-14T12:51Z,Can i update this version so it can run on intel based machines?
,cvbones,2006-05-16T17:56Z,Can some people please seed???

,asdxx,2006-07-31T23:47Z,"i keep getting ""your system doesnt meet the system requirements."" and i have  a macbook pro with all the upgrades!"
,mspider,2006-09-07T07:30Z,"Thats b/c the MacBookPro needs the 1.1 version, your auto updater should give you free updates, mine did. But I cant find a SN # for version 1.1       

Anyone have Aperture 1.1 SN# ?????"

for all you intel-users;

update-function in os x to get the
latest update. it will work then."
,heimdull,2006-09-22T20:24Z,"Hi Guys,

Is it normal to only get 5K/s when downloding from here? I'm new here btw.. Or do people have to ""seed""?"

,solsolsol,2006-10-15T20:53Z,"Does anyone know why I canÂ´t open the program in my Macbook? Do I have to have a special card or program to open .dmg programs? Hoping someone knows the answer, this is just soooo enoying! I can hardly load down anything from piratebay..."
,solsolsol,2006-10-15T20:54Z,"... and I forgot to say that I am very, very grateful for suggestions on what to do :-)!"
,Xiansol,2006-10-27T21:26Z,"solsolsol...you're pretty new to mac right...-.dmg files are standard image files for mac, you mount them by double-clicking on the icon. They probably contain programs which you then drag to your applications folder to install"

,keikeikei5210,2007-11-04T11:25Z,This cannot be installed in macmini. 
,Bassman12593,2007-12-30T07:40Z,"You can actually just download the trial from Apple's website and when prompted for the trial serial that they email you, just paste in a working pirated one and you get the full app without the time limit. Hell of a lot faster than downloading a torrent. Its how I got mine to work."
