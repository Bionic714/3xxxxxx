What is a Mindjet MindManager Map?

At their simplest, Mindjet┬« MindManager┬« maps function like street maps. They represent complex information in an organized, easy-to-understand visual format. And they enable you to easily grasp connections, obstacles, and paths so you can quickly choose the best course of action. But instead of facilitating travel, MindManager maps improve processes, projects, and planning. Another difference: you build your own.

Easy to start: Capture

With its intuitive, highly interactive interface, a MindManager map is a snap to begin. Click anywhere and type a central topic. From there, the map welcomes as much creative thinking as you and your team can generate. It even pulls in external information from websites, databases, spreadsheets, blogs, and more. Customizable wizards and templates, and a one-stop task pane, streamline and standardize map creation.

Easy to take action: Organize

MindManager maps show you the ?big picture? through cascading connections between related topics and sub-topics, plus quick-glance highlighting, icons, formats, and pictures. Soon you?re making better decisions in less time. And that?s only the start. Maps are also blueprints for action, enabling you to assign and manage tasks, resources, timelines, and deliverables.

Easy to extend information enterprise-wide: Share

The free Mindjet MindManager Viewer puts everyone in your organization on the same map with search, navigate, print, and publish capabilities. For enterprise-wide impact you can save maps as bitmaps, Adobe PDFs, and web pages, and export map content to Microsoft┬« Office and other enterprise applications. MindManager maps are even pen-enabled for tablet PCs, so they travel anywhere you do.
