Thanks."
,badorworse,2006-02-28T20:35Z,"The quality in this movie is acceptable, it's far from good. If you can, download another version."
,jakEEm86,2006-03-06T01:09Z,"Judefarfar: 
Jag vet ju förståss inte vad ditt problem är. 
Men jag skulle kunna tro att timeadjuster skulle rätta till dina problem med texten: 
hämta på www.undertexter.se 
och klicka dig fram till det."
,Lord_Kamiizumi,2006-03-14T01:46Z,High quality.  
,unborniwished,2006-03-15T04:28Z,"This 2nd transporter movie completly sucks compared to the 1st, that was a good movie, subtle comedy, non-heavy film effects as used in this one wich aren't spectacular but what makes it worse is that are always used in the worse scenes.
Compared to the first this one basicly has no action driving scenes(only 2).

The script is utter crapp, the old hollywood couple in trouble with a kidnap ... ffs... also the ""bad ass"" lame anemic chick with flat breats and poor heavy makeup doesn't fit anything at all to be in a role of bad ass chick and it shows very well for the extreme bad performance of the actor.

SERIOUSLY, watch the first tranporter it's 4x better than this crappy sequel."
,manssss,2006-03-20T16:08Z,very very bad movie dont see it
,gre22,2006-03-24T18:12Z,"Good quality, but I cant say the same about the movie.

@ZinZah, Thanx for sharing this one.
I like both Transporter movies.

@3d recon: not everyone is a native english  speaker. 
Apparently, the world is bigger then the UK/USA territory. I say it with respect. You may use some respect instead of curse.
