,dattebayo8,2007-02-04T03:05Z,sorry.. i am quite new in dloading torrents.. i really want to help so that sites dat support this will be contnue on working... so how do i seed?
,iLovefreestuff,2007-04-08T03:48Z,how do I know there files don't have a virus on them. 
,wavecutter,2007-08-01T14:57Z,"You idiot iLovefreestuff, you have to run an executable to actually install a virus on you PC.
These ar just book you fucking retard."
,CarnageHeart,2007-09-28T22:10Z,"wavecutter - dont call people an idiot when youre an idiot too.

you dont have to run an .exe for a virus to get on your system. there is such a thing as an embedded virus.

it can be in the form of a picture, an audio file, a movie, a pdf, etc. all it needs is that you open the file for it to be installed."
,HollowCrow,2008-01-13T05:51Z,"Wavecutter, you're a real shit-heel. Someone has a legitimate question and you jump down their throat. You are completely uncouth.
BTW, don't call others retarded when you cannot pluralize your nouns or spell simple words. "
,yurnotsoeviltwin,2008-06-12T23:47Z,"Is this in the form of images, or has it been converted to text so it's smaller and searchable?"
,MstrRich,2009-05-28T23:00Z,You fucking lying sack of shit. This torrent doesn't even contain HALF of the D&D books released. Where's the MM2? The MM 4 and 5? The PHB2 and the DMG 2? What about the Complete series? Stop mislabeling your shit.
,comodidit,2009-06-01T05:57Z,"I only downloaded the Complete Adventurer. The scan quality was horrendous and unreadable and it was not searchable, also many pages did not display properly or appeared completely blank."
,Yisaa,2009-06-09T13:47Z,"MstrRich - wtf? Where do you get off calling someone a ""fucking lying sack of shit"". If you are too cheap to buy the actual books then you have no right to complain when trying to download them illegally. Since you're not actually paying anything you should be grateful for whatever you get.

And by the way you can see what files are contained in the torrent before you download it so I don't see what the big deal is."
,ILoveLamps,2009-07-29T01:53Z,"MstrRich, this torrent is from 2005, hence it only has books from 2005 and earlier. Kindly die in a hole you little shit."

,npwest27,2009-12-21T20:47Z,"Downloading at 1.8 mb/s

Will finally have the books we needed. Thanks TTMSHU and seeders."
,Kopliu,2010-02-07T02:00Z,"Great torrent, muuuuuuuuuuuuuuuch better then the 3.0/3.5 torrent than at the top this one has ALOT more of the books the other lacked. i already got the other one but i'ma have to get this one too.
I'll seed for a long time on this one. "
,keldarion,2010-03-02T04:43Z,Personally i'm hoping to compile and update the forgotten realms materials and other items i'm not seeing in the pathfinder system to the pathfinder system.  Hail to our great system!
,25Adonzel,2010-03-05T02:46Z,"Downloading this right now. If you're reading this and are seeding, thanks a lot!"
,CapitalistDog,2010-03-31T23:46Z,"LOL@ wavecutter

=P Your ass got fucking chewed up, and spit out.

PS: Good DL, thanks for the data!"
,mink580,2010-05-01T17:59Z,Any one who is pissed about this is a fuck tard the guy who made this is epic and should be congratulated.
,nickguyatt,2010-06-16T18:32Z,"Believe me, this is far from ""Basically every D&D book released"". There are numerous books missing, the Races series, Savage Species, Complete Champion, Complete Mage, Complete Psionic, and Complete Scoundrel, Deities and Demigods, Dragon Magic, Drow of The Underdark, Dungeonscape, the list just goes on and on. This is a good torrent don't get me wrong, but it isn't complete. Just saying."
,nickguyatt,2010-06-20T12:02Z,Bigger and better torrent can be found here: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3843905/Dungeons_and_Dragons_Books
,CanadianElite,2010-07-07T00:48Z,lul wavecutter got SHUT DOWN
,saturnine4,2010-09-25T05:42Z,Spacebattles.com is absolute shit. 
,Aurasan,2011-07-23T21:08Z,"1) Arguing on the internet is like the special olympics.

2) You are ALL n00bs, you're not supposed to feed the trolls.

3) @mutepirate: +1 man.

4) A file imbedded with a virus still needs to be executed for the virus to work. Regardless, this is why we have hash check. (thus, an ignorant query, not a legitimate one)

5) learn punctuation before bitching at others about their spelling or grammar

6) TTMSHU: Thanks man. Keep up the good work!"
,bvorak,2011-11-13T13:57Z,Thank you infinitely.
,vestha01,2012-03-15T03:50Z,"@ iLovefreestuff - In order to use the Torrents and to seed, you firstly need to download UTorrent program, you might find it for free on http://www.utorrent.com/ after you have download it and install it, you then click on ""Get this Torrent"" and start to download it, once you're done d'loading it will start to seed automatically.

Also, you might want to run the antivirus if you're a tad paranoid like myself and as a second recommendation, do not run ANY .exe programs that you don't recognize at all, check them up on google and check those couple times with your antivirus programs.-

Also, does anybody knows where can I d'load the rest of the books? I'd appreciate that greatly.

And wavecutter kindly go and get shoved up into your pooper a red-hot rusty poker, okthxsbye.
