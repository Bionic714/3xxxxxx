,fairchild,2006-01-08T12:58Z,Does anyone know where I can find a no cd crack for this game?
,fairchild,2006-01-10T22:01Z,"Thanks tibcr, that was just what I needed, IÂ´ll make sure to remember that site!"
,Got Satan?,2006-01-24T07:31Z,"kamukaze, socialism is quite similar to democracy but in my opinion, better. get facts before opening your mouth. This game does sound much like propagando though...maybe scare tactics...."
,punker91,2006-02-13T20:00Z,damn this one is slow as hell. Someone seed.
,Piddyx,2006-02-22T23:29Z,"I have 95.5%, then I get this error: ""Rejected by tracker - this tracker is for torrents on TPB only""  How do I fix this?

,Zeraio,2009-02-17T20:35Z,More seeders please! Stuck at 0-1KBPS! 
,ltcmdrData,2009-03-30T00:56Z,"actually, Got Satan?, socialism is more similiar to communism. why don't YOU learn the facts before you open YOUR mouth."
,ltcmdrData,2009-03-30T01:15Z,"unless you have a lot of time to spare, I wouldn't bother downloading. the best I have gotten with this is 12kb/s. if I ever do download it(and that's a big is) I will seed for a very long time."
,zbiggie,2009-06-12T08:40Z,"wow, ltcmdrData you also have it wrong. Socialism is something like a republican or liberal system.  All it refers to is building or enhancing social services such as hospitals, transport, community services, and has nothing to do with political party systems other then the policies of the party involved.

Communism is a one party system which dictates what rules the system will follow. It may allow other parties into the government but it will have full dominance or this system will fail.

And democracy on the other hand allows a multi-party system to operate. 

Therefor you can have a socialist communist state, which the USSR claimed to be but blatantly was not, as well as socialist democratic parties, which dominate canada and most of the european states, or in the USA is very loosely represented by the democrats. This is mostly because anyone who claims to be a socialist in the USA is automatically called a Nazi or Communist due to the 'name' association during WWII and cold war era."
,zbiggie,2009-06-12T08:41Z,also by the way only 500b downloading. Damn. I'll try finding a better tracker
,zbiggie,2009-06-15T07:02Z,"well more seeders have been found, thanks for the upload"

,Murphy416,2010-04-14T01:27Z,"Don't know why people are taught that the US is a democracy. What it's supposed to be is a constitutional republic, what it is in practice is a fascist oligarchy, dominated by corporate interests."
,fallout11,2011-08-10T01:02Z,"Murphy is sadly correct. 
Thanks for uploading this, been wanting to give it a try."
,fallout11,2011-12-05T01:02Z,"This game does not run with Vista or Win7 64 bit OS, even in XP compatibility mode.

You have to use MSConfig to restrict the machine to 2Gig Ram max, reboot, then run it to get it to work. Lame-oh."
