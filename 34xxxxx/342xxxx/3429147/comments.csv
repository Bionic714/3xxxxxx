,dadawah,2007-01-08T22:55Z,Yes! Mavis really beats Aretha and Mary J. I Couldn't agree more :D There must be a reason for Bob Dylan wanting to marry her when he heard her wonderful voice and phrasing (way back in the past)
,Dutchs11,2007-08-09T02:04Z,Would someone let me know if there is somewhere I can get the latest from Mavis Staples that is not in FLAC.  I have a friend that really loves this music and I can only find it in FLAC format.  No way I can burn in that format.  Help...*(
