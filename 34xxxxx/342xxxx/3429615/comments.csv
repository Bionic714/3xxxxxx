,Moffatott,2006-01-12T00:08Z,Is this game in english??
,Sjampoo,2006-01-13T21:36Z,"Some answers:

The game is accessible by unpacking the RAR-file with WinRAR and then mounting it with Daemon Tools / Alcohol (no file corruptions).

BUT, the game is NOT in English, so Mr/Miss 1982Wei0 could have posted that. It's 100% Japanese."
