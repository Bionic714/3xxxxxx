,Dead-Inside,2006-01-07T01:44Z,"These are ripped, ""Piece of crap"", versions. Concidering today's overflow of bandwidth I'd recommend a regular, fullsize, Image of both games. It's worth it."
,IceMaster,2006-01-07T17:57Z,"I agree, ripped games are bullshit in general."
,Skyl3lazer,2006-01-08T15:41Z,"The rips of the full CD's would be pointless, all you have to do is install the patch manually and get a no cd crack for it and it works. Email me at enrico.thunderlord@gmail.com if you want me to rip the full SC/BW cd's"
,youko,2006-02-10T05:12Z,"Skyl3lazer is right, you new school punks have no clue.  The last time I downloaded this game it was about this size and worked great.  FYI, your image is ""ripped"" to begin with, duh, and even though a cd image of starcraft is upwards of 700 megs the actual program is only like 100 megs, so there.  So why eat up more bandwidth than you have to?"
,petergarrat10,2007-06-01T09:20Z,"what is skyblazer and youker talking about. do you hav to do something else?

,Marcus101RR,2008-01-11T05:57Z,"1. This is the best compact version of StarCraft.
2. Great for people who do not like the big bullshit.
3. It's by Razor, so expect Quality and not Quantity."
,oPiN37,2008-04-22T22:41Z,"can you play this on Vista? love the game, but I have Vista, so I wanna know I itÂ´s possible to install it before I download the game...."
