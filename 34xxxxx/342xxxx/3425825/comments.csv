,JacquesMerde,2007-12-11T05:04Z,"People who delete any file after they have finished downloading and not help others by seeding should be thrown out.
Think that anyone who wants to download should have to logon."
,kriegerg69,2010-10-25T13:36Z,Please seed this again...it's stuck at 80% for me right now.
,kriegerg69,2010-11-27T19:55Z,This is STILL stuck at 80%...Someone PLEASE reseed this or get rid of this torrent! :-P
,kriegerg69,2010-12-03T14:54Z,Really strange (and annoying) that I'm seeing 6 out of 11 peers in uTorrent....but NO ONE is seeding this. No one is going to be able to finish this (it is STILL stuck at 80%!) unless someone seeds this...PLEASE!!
