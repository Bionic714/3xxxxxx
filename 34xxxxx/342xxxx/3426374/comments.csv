,Pirate 32,2006-01-05T05:02Z,"Thankyou.  My mom asked me to download this and I am amazed I could even find it.

PS Also thanks for making this a PROPER rip(720 X 480) such a thing is rare these days.

PS2 What audio format is this? (If you know)"
,Pirate 32,2006-01-05T05:02Z,PS3 btw when using rar archives people normally split the archive into smaller pieces and include an sfv.  That way if the archive is corrupt they can use the .sfv to determine which piece is bad and redownload the 30MB piece instead of the whole thing.  Just f.y.i. and thanks again.
