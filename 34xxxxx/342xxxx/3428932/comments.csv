,clerromara,2008-01-14T01:42Z,Can anyone seed this?  There are a bunch of us trying to finish the download.
,esotericx10,2009-03-07T03:40Z,Ok Guys I complained to Pirate Bay bout this on 3-6-09. Lets see how long it takes for them to fix this. Like the rest of you I'm stuck at 82.5% of the dlowload
,Ghis1964,2009-03-27T11:58Z,"I'm dl this even tho I knew Id be stuck at 82.5%,
I even left a message to gamer11515 at demonoid hoping he could seedback.... its been a week now.

thx anyway"
,gamer11515,2009-03-28T23:58Z,Reseeding now...
,Ghis1964,2009-03-29T04:03Z,"thx, I think I'v found you just in time man

it made think of this; the next time I'll back up a file from torrent, and mines alike, I'll burn the utorrent hash-link in a folder with them own files instead of throwing it away after dl is done. So whenever I need to know if the seed is weak, I'll throw the disc in and let utorrent give me the update.

thanks again man"

,BG_Pirate,2011-06-17T12:22Z,This needs some seed.
,BG_Pirate,2011-06-19T18:18Z,"OMFG This is hardcore religious propaganda.
What a waste of time and bandwith.
I prefer to listen to speakers like Tsarion and Alan Watt. This Horowitz guy seems to care only about his imaginary God and nothing else (like all x-tians). He doesn't even have a clue that the Bible talks about the Anunnaki and not about some God.
Oh and he just said at 34:04 that he is a christian Jew (puke) "
