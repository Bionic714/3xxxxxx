,Natall,2006-02-06T05:43Z,"This is way better than vhisseu.  They are evolving artists and as you see here that is not always a good thing.  Oh well, this is still one of the greatest punk albums of all time."
,albaholic,2006-02-27T15:19Z,"vhisseu is a great album. I have to admit it took a while for it to grow on me, but it did. The lyrical depth is amazing. All of thrice's Albums are great. Illusion and artist are my favorites by far though"
,Stringz44,2006-09-16T22:10Z,Vheissu is absolutely their best album. I don't care what you say.. or anyone else. Bands that evolve are the best bands..  and this album is decent but Vheissu kills it in every aspect. The only reason someone would like this better is because they arent open or into more creative/ambient/etc type music... anyway... enough said.
