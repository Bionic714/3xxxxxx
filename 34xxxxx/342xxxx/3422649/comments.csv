,john-a,2009-02-05T22:49Z,"Getterunit1: You have to run the TBOOK.EXE with the extention PJ1.TBK , PJ2.TBK or PJ3.TBK. The files Section1.exe, Section2.exe Section3.exe and Section4.exe are suppose to do this for you, but there is a known bug that makes it belive that the TBK files are in the wrong place if the file gets linked wrong. 

Try using the command ""TBOOK.EXE PJ1.TBK"" from the cmd when inside the correct directory.

The software does not work in 64 bit windows. If you have Vista 64 just install xVM with WinXP and you should be fine."

,nicodog,2009-02-26T04:03Z,"I got this installed in Linux under Wine. There seems to be a problem with sound though, I'm still figuring things out. Thanks for the torrent! 

This thing is pretty small, so I might just be able to seed this for a long time! (My speeds aren't so hot, though) thanks!"
