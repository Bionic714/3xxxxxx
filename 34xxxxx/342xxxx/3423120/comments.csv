,2twisty,2006-02-05T23:29Z,"RE: 70-294

Try renaming the file to .BIN

I used WinImage to extract the files to a folder, then burned the CD.

It then installed flawlessly."

When asked for he logon ID, click enter, the login will fail but you'll get a button allowing you to register ... the registration merely adds the user to the program, IT IS NOT A SECURITY CHECK."

Everytime I try to progress from the first video, or even click onto different sections (clicking next, using the navigation pane etc) it kicks me back to the screen after log on.

,diggs07,2006-04-05T15:42Z,"I'm still in the process of downloading, but when I downloaded A+ testout, I used Nero 7 to mount an image with Nero Drive.  It simulates a cd.  Worked flawlessly!"
,diggs07,2006-04-05T23:03Z,"Just completed the download.  I tested a couple of the courses with various videos and it works beautifully.  Again, I used Nero 7 and applied the Nero ImageDrive function.  It's under Tools through your Programs list if you have this version.  Allows you to save a burn, if anything.  Thanks!!!"
,assassinas,2006-04-10T13:35Z,"Hey esmith13.
Wondering if you guys could help me out with a copy of the testout network+ 2005 kit. would be a real help, as the 2002 on i have is great, but not comprehensive. thanks chaps :D"

Totally useless! Bet it was seeded by TestOut themselves"

,dmasmarty,2006-10-08T04:17Z,"JohnJoe or anybody .. I juz wondering why on certain video they juz reset back the application to the profile?

Other works great juz some of it couldn't be played at all. If it's video problem, what should I fix and how? Is there any codec I suppose to have? (I use K-Lite Mega Codec 1.59 now) 

Please help me figure this out.."
,dmasmarty,2006-10-08T05:22Z,"Well I dload the 3.+GB Compressed of this thing, and extract it well. Then mount it to PowerISO, and it also works well. Everything to the final installation process are juz great. 

I can access the program and do the exam and whatsoever they include in the program but what I can't do is watch the simulation movies, and when I click the movie link, it juz close the session and put me at the start menu for choosing module. 

My guess it is because of some video probs, but I don't know how to fix it. 

Can someone out there help please...  "

,Quirky_Puppy,2008-01-17T11:56Z,"@mycowsir

lol! yup, I'd help too, but the thought occurs that if someone can't even burn a disk, then maybe this is the wrong torrent for them?"
,detonador,2008-02-12T01:31Z,thks ;))
,captainkremmen,2008-03-21T10:08Z,"For those of you having problems:

These files are in NRG format (why uploaders can't just use ISO or BIN/CUE which almost every disc image software - including Nero - can create or burn I'll never known).

NRG is a disc image format used by Nero. A few other disc image apps can use Nero but most can't can't.

NRG is very close to BIN though, so in SOME cases renaming the files to BIN will work thereby allowing you to burn or mount with your favourite software but in most cases it will fail.

You will either need to download and install Nero or use one of the small apps you can get that can change an NRG file to a BIN or ISO first.

Once you download the image files, either mount them in your compatible software or burn the image files to disc. You'll then be able to install.

When the LOGIN screen appears, just click Cancel and you can create an account for yourself. Don't worry, this is just for creating an account to login to the training, it wont send your details to anywhere.

If you are having problems playing the videos it may be because you either don't have the correct codecs (in which case download and install a codec pack such as K-LITE) or check your video card settings if you already have K-Lite installed.

Finally, you can use the programs update feature to get the latest versions and latest questions, it seems to work fine and doesn't require a crack or activation."
