,WeLiveForTheDying,2009-03-11T03:50Z,I'll be seeding this for a while I guess. Badass album. Wish Murder the Dance could have lived up to it though
,DespisedIcon,2009-04-17T05:23Z,"I agree with WeLiveForTheDying down there VVV.

Murder the Dance was nowhere as Amazing compared to this Album.

This album is amazing overall in the Music and Lyrics."
