,user88,2006-01-07T22:14Z,"When Jesus declared that he was a spiritual son of God, people crucified him. When Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him declared that he was the messenger of God, people chase him out of the town. When I post this torrent, you people post hate comments. So it's all the same. But you like it or not God's Message will live on."
,w000ter,2006-01-07T22:39Z,and when david koresh proclaimed himself the messiah.... blah blah blah.  its called irrational thinking.
,user88,2006-01-08T00:35Z,"Truth shall be heard, and people with open heart will be accepting the Truth! Whether you like it w00ter or not. http://www.convertstoislam.org"
,w000ter,2006-01-08T02:12Z,anyone that claims the truth based on nonsense should be ridiculed.  islam like other religions is a virus of the mind that should be irradicated.  it encourages and validates the irrational thinking that leads to the horrors that plague the world.
,user88,2006-01-08T02:38Z,"w00ter people like you will be calling for help from God when they face the death and that time they realise that nothing can help them except the Creator. While you are still well and alive I think you should make a little serious research about Islam rather than putting this nonsense hate links, they are 100% false and are made by Islam haters or religion haters."
,user88,2006-01-08T02:42Z,"w00ter your research can start from this pdf file, download it and read it. 30 minutes of your time is nothing for you, but it might save you from Hellfire (but I doubt about you changing though), God has given you (to humans) average 60 years... can't you spend 30 minutes of your time to know the God? Just put all the hatred aside and give it a try, nobody ask you to convert but at least you will have the true idea about Islam."
,w000ter,2006-01-08T03:20Z,"nothing more than the meaningless nonsense any religion spouts.  damn the unbeliever, claim unearned unjustified claim on truth to feel superior.  it is fundamentally evil and devisive."
,w000ter,2006-01-08T03:23Z,"the only thing one can be sure of is that a rational god if there is one would not create something horrible as islam.  and if he did, he would not deserve worship. 
its always amusing how you think your religion is right and every other religion is wrong based on essentially nothing."
,w000ter,2006-01-08T03:32Z,"empts such as abu garib and your probable scorn for such an institutions.  he is the master torturer and  his children should follow his ultimate example and smite their enemies, nothing is too horrible for the infidel.   
so renounce your silly false religion now and worship the master of torture.  to emulate his sadistic tendencies is to know the mind of god."
,w000ter,2006-01-08T03:32Z,"not to mention, you will regret your choice to spread such nonsense when you die and find out that you have spent your life spitting in the face of zeus.  you will spend eternity in hellfire experiencing the most excuciating tortures as zeus/aka god is the master of suffering.  abu garibs got nothing on what he's got.  in fact he laughs at feeble att"
,w000ter,2006-01-08T03:39Z,"lol research.  researching what? facts? sorry, mad ramblings of ancient scriptures is proof of nothing more than the ability of humans to create mythology in times of ignorance.  it would do you some good to crack open a book on philosphy and critical thinking because you cannot fall back on the circular logic of saying something is the truth because it says it is."
,user88,2006-01-08T18:24Z,"w00ter it's always easy to blame the religion for somebody's horrible behavior. Saddam or all those corrupt Muslim leaders does not represent the true Islam. Don't be an ignorant, if you are logical person (you seem so) then you should give Islam a fair chance, do not just hate without knowing the real message. Internet is full of Islam haters, if you want to know the real Islam study the authentic sources."
,Darndare,2006-01-21T13:30Z,"User88: In your first comment you claim to be a prophet, like jesus or mohammed. Is not that a sacrilege? 
Religion is a genetic disorder."
,user88,2006-02-09T21:10Z,"""Darndare"" read it carefully, I didn't claim to be anything..."
,Bedömaren,2006-02-12T04:05Z,"w000ter is a person (?) who lives on this site by spreading anti-thoughts. w000ter never portrayes his (must be!) own thoughts. rationality as HE knows it is an idea not older than 400 years. I suggest he do some reading.. study his own history perhaps. Try some books on: The Enlightenment, The Scientific Revolution, Rene Decartes........ and so on
- detachment of the mind is the problem not religious theories!"
,Bedömaren,2006-02-12T04:06Z,"good UP by the way
thx user88"
,katamail,2006-02-12T17:56Z,"They come to our country as refugees saying that their lives are in danger so OUR own GOVERNMENT give them a nice welcome pack of

1) A House

2) State Welfare

3) Job

4) Whatever They Want (otherwise it is RACIAL DISCRIMINATION)

We have our own worries and people to look after never mind taking on the worlds problems, they breed like bloody rabbits have more than their fair share of property and cars, they have taken over most of our major cities and call themselves the ETHNIC MINORITY i think we all know who is the real minority in this country dont we. It should all change starting with:

1) Deportation of ALL middle east people ( let them suffer in their own country rather than us in ours)

2) Any monies owed to them put into a holding account to pay for the war vets of the gulf war and to the ones who gave us our real freedom (ww2) vets

3) No return policies

4) Any money proved to have been earnt in this country taken away and used to aid our homeless or ill

5) Any funds to their countries/families STOPPED"

,volitair,2006-02-22T15:24Z,"I agree.  I'm tired of other cultures coming to our countries to enjoy our freedoms and then try to change us to their intollerant bullshit.  What ever happened to assimulation?

Let's all move there and spread our religions and our way of life.  Wonder if they'd be tolerant, or if they'd all riot and burn everything in sight?
Hmm... then we could go home and they'd have to live in hell once again.

FUCK the Abram followers."
,kemiro,2006-04-25T21:29Z,Beliving in something so stupid as muhammeds imaginations and even kill other people for not sharing the same indoctrination is a proof of how mad human minds are.
,Pirate 32,2006-05-21T19:25Z,"yeah, ""brief"" as in it doesnt include the war/genocide suras that later ""abrogated"" the nice ones."
,AIKISBEST,2007-10-18T19:05Z,"fuck islam.

Satan is the true god!!!!!!

HAIL SATAN !!!!!!
AVE SATANA !!!!!!
REGE SATANA !!!!!!"
,rockstar11998,2008-04-22T21:29Z,"w000ter - no it's not irrational thinking, it's called subjecting yourself to the power and influence of the Devil.  Hitler falls into the same category as Muhammad.  Both wanted to do a 'good' thing in their eyes but the methods were pure evil.

User88 - Islam has much truth but not all of it that's why your religion's history is so messed up and why terrorism is so prevalent today.  All it takes is a few bad teachings to create the problems Islam has in the world.  You and wooter seem to both have much confusion about life.  Neither of you have a clue what you're talking about.  You both forget the power of Satan.
Wooter - We don't dam the unbeliever in my religion.  You will dam yourself though if you refuse to acknowledge Jesus is the Christ.  Are you really that blind to not see all of the prophecies fulfilled from the Bible or are you just ignorant of historical facts.  By your statements you seem to assume way too much.  I like how you said you can't say something is true because it says it is.  I agree, you need to go to the source - God - through humble sincere prayer and ask Him what is truth and what is right.  Any other way won't be enough for salvation and understanding.
Darndare - To claim to be a prophet is not a bad thing.  The Bible says that God would like all to be prophets.  There are two ways to look at a true prophet.  A prophet always testifies of Jesus Christ as the Savior.  The other way is that a prophet is a specific messenger of God chosen to lead his people and reveal His word.  Muhammad doesn't qualify in either respect because he doesn't teach the divinity of Jesus Christ."
