,kalle77,2006-01-03T18:15Z,ahhh... finally! Does anyone have any info on the first three seasons or where to get them from?
,etien,2006-01-10T01:17Z,"hey, same here, just found out about this show, would really appreciate if somebody could reseed the first three seasons!
Thanks a lot"
,t3m,2006-01-24T15:10Z,"Im in the same boat, they used to play this show in my country but then stoped for no reason a few episodes into season 3 (i think). 
It seams there arent even DVD's of the series because of music clearence issues.
This is probly why there are no torrents of it out there."
,tekef,2006-02-14T22:47Z,Me too. I would like to see the first 3 seasons too.
,narnoor,2006-04-27T19:35Z,"thanx for this.. i relly love this show.. ED is soo cool. I wonder if seasons 1,2, and 3 are available??? does anyone have them??"
,jsmoove,2006-07-28T00:12Z,"Desperately after Season 3. (actually the episode called ""The Movie"").

Anyway any help appreciated. email jsmoove@nildram.co.uk"
,limbodance,2006-09-24T12:35Z,"Oh my God, you are my hero, Friedle! I was lucky to watch this tv show in my country during summer (as a sort of rerun), I wonder why I never knew of the show before. But as you describe the theme songs, it seems it was the 2nd season, but the tv guide it was the 3rd season, but it was clearly ""moment in the sun"". So I am hesitating to download the 4th season, I might have missed too much. Does anybody know another torrent site OR a synopsis site, where I can read what happened in the episodes inbetween?! thank you! (feel free to message me via piratebay) 
Ed is the coolest :)"
,zioloeth,2007-06-18T17:03Z,"The other 3 seasons can be downloaded from mininova

just search for : Ed stuckeyville"
,NisseHHult,2007-12-13T20:17Z,"I can't freaking find season 1, 2 and 3 with seeders! God damned it, i want to hear Phil say SHAVE MY POODLE! Damned, god damned it all!"
,svullos_pekfinger,2008-02-17T15:25Z,"Please please please, could someone upload the first 3 seasons? I promise I would seed forever! I miss Ed! :("
,howardthetree,2008-04-17T01:03Z,any possibility of some more seeders hopping back on this? im at about 98.8% and i'm getting a really slow transfer speed. thanks!
,gp85,2008-05-07T09:07Z,"hey guys just wondering if u either need a special codec to play these or if u need to wait till the whole torrent has been downloaded before u play any of the videos? Cos im still in the proccess of downloading the torrent but none of the videos work using either wmp or divx. : ( I WANT TO WATCH ED!!!
thanks"
,Kiminator,2009-01-14T00:06Z,"Hey everyone, I'd like to bump this request for 2009. If anyone know where to POSSIBLY get ahold of the first three seasons that would be just magical. On Mininova there seems to be seasons two and three, but I still need season one haha. Anyone? ):"
,babycat,2009-01-16T21:29Z,you can get Ed season 1 from sumotorrent but its quite slow
,Kiminator,2009-02-06T23:51Z,"Thanks for the tip!
I also found season 1 on mininova if anyone of you guys are interested. I'm about to try and dl it."
,Kiminator,2009-02-06T23:52Z,for some reason i can't link to it but it's called 'ED Season 1 aka Stuckeyville'
