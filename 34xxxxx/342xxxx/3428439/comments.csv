,red ballz,2006-09-13T19:36Z,"BLOODY HELL!!! THIS AINT BLACK EDITION M8!!
"
,tonyboner,2006-09-14T00:38Z,"1) Please read the instructions enclosed with the torrent.  If you follow them closely, it will work (unless your computer can't handle it).

2) It most definately IS the Black edition.  You can tell because of the Black Challenge (last one) and the new car ('67 Camaro).

3) Don't try and open the .exe in the crack folder.  Copy it to your game directory and then open it.  At this point, you can also use the shortcut on your Start Menu.

4) We read .nfo files with Notepad.  Right click on them and select 'open with.'

5) The serial number is included in the .nfo file.

6) Keep in mind that RELOADED is one of the best groups out there.  If they post something, it's usually good.  If not, they tend to fix it quickly AND it's still the best out there.

7) Thanks for the great post."
