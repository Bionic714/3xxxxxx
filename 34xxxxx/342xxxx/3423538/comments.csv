,.BlackIce,2010-01-06T02:57Z,"4 years since anyone commented, rofl.  Just downloaded DMC3: Special Edition for my computer after playing this game a lot with my friend 3 or 4 years ago.  (Yes, you can play 2 player, but 2nd player only appears as a black shadow)  Very nice, will seed 4-5x more.  And all you fucking noobs, stop bitching at people to seed.  This downloaded 300kb/s+ for me the entire time.  Why don't you guys actually seed for once and stop bitching when you know absolutely nothing about the Bit Torrent protocol."
