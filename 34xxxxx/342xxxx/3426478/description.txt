Ken Follett - Code to Zero 

---From the Jacket

January, 1958. A man wakes to find himself lying on the ground in a railway station. 
He cannot remember how he got there. He has forgotten where he lives. He does not 
even know his own name. 

At Cape Canaveral, a countdown has begun. On launch pad 26B sits Explorer I, 
America's best hope to match the Soviet Sputnik and regain the lead in the race 
for the skies above. 

Bound together by the past, separated by the war, and caught up in the mighty 
struggle between the superpowers, four old friends from Harvard sit at the very 
center in the this dangerous heart of the cold war. And as Luke Lucas relearns 
the story of his life, he uncovers long-kept secrets about his wife, his best 
friend, the woman he once loved more than life itself... and realizes that his 
fate is tied to the rocket that stands ready on launch pad 26B at the Cape. 
Luke knew something that someone was desperate for him to forget, and unless 
he is able to discover that terrible, deadly secret, Luke may be left powerless 
to save the launch of Explorer - and with it, America's future.
