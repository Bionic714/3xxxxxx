  Release Notes:

  Debut album from Sheffield-born quartet the Arctic Monkeys.
  Even before the release of this first offering, the band
  were being touted as the next big thing. With their mix of
  melodic pop, fused with a punk-garage edge, their sound
  appeals to the alternative rock crowd. Their first single.
  'I Bet You Look Good On The Dancefloor', which went straight
  in at No.1 in the UK singles chart, is included.
