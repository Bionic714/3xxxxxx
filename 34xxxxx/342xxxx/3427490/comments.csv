,smithandpitman,2010-06-21T14:33Z,"OK CHAPS - HERE IS HOW IT APPEARS TO WORK:

-COMPLETE SETUP
-LOAD UP WINUAE
-SELECT FROM THE LIST: ""ifnotworktrythis -ECS Agnus Chipset-kickstart13""
-SELECT LOAD, THEN OK
-A NEW SCREEN SHOULD LOAD UP WITH A WHITE SCREEN AND A DISC IN IT.
-GO TO PROGRAM FILES/WINUAE, AND GO INTO THE AMIGA GAMES FOLDER.
-SIMPLY DRAG A GAME INTO THE SCREEN WITH THE DISK, AND THE GAME SHOULD LOAD
-PRESS ALT AND TAB TOGETHER TO RELEASE MOUSE POINTER FROM SCREEN

SORRY BUT THIS IS MY LAST TIME ON THIS PAGE, SO WILL NOT BE ABLE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS.

IT WORKS FINE FOR ME - MANY THANKS FOR THE UPLOAD - RETRO!!!"
