,Slutty(DK),2007-02-20T17:50Z,"To all of you who dosent know what to do with an ISO file....

There is a couple of options..

1: Mount the ISO file in a program called Deamon Tools (Its a virtual DVD Drive) This program is usefull to those who just want to watch the movie on their computer with a WMP Or some other DVD viewing program..

2: Burn The ISO in Either DVD decrypter, Nero ""Burn Image"" Or some other DVD Burning Program...

PM me for specific help on any issue..

Hope it helps some of you guys who dosent know what to do.."
