ABOUT THIS COLLECTION:

This release is (as with my Ravi Shankar Collection release - see 
http://thepiratebay.org/details.php?id=3421975) the first version 
of a comprehensive collection of the Dalai Lama's recorded 
teachings. 


FUTURE RELEASES:

I'm editing some live speeches given by the Dalai Lama and will 
release them in an "add on pack" in early 2006. 

Anyone who can contribute to the collection, please help out. 

Thank you and enjoy,

_Arjuna_


P.S. Please reseed at least at a 2:1 ratio...
