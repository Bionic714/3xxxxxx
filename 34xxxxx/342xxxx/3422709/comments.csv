if u want a cheap ass mmorpg go paly ragnarok or lineage 1 or 2, koreans are the only noobs that use Aegis and PHP on theyr servers, that's why u can make a private one, FFXI is tottaly custom and well worth it."
,yeehaa,2007-01-03T04:27Z,could use some seeding mate.....hard to DL without anyone to DL from.
,pan!C,2007-01-04T04:03Z,"There is no Free Servers on FFXI; They are all PHP, however there are Private Servers which GMs can play on at their will but they are mostly for testing and dont offer much gameplay. This torrent is pretty much useless unless you've lost the disks in the past but still have your registration codes and account information. Or are switching to PC from Xbox or PS2."
,mrgaay,2007-03-25T00:18Z,"pan!C, it sure is free servers on final fantasy! www.extremetop100.com go check it out yourself. i've been played on one. stop telling the others lies, its loads of servers out there in the big wide world! :D"

,quezicotl,2008-06-29T09:09Z,"If I could atleast get a 1kb/sec download, i could reseed on here and frostwire. And by the way you don't need a mod to play games off a harddrive on you ps2, to shorten this up , just google ""external harddrive on ps2"" do a little reading and you'll get where I'm going with this, And you DON""T have to chance damaging your ps2, and if you get everything going right, FREE GAMES!!!"
