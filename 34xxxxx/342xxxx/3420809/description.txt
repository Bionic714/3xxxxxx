Instructions:
1)Unrar
2)Run trainer
3)Click the launch button and select narnia exe in its directory
4)load your save game or begin new one..
5)Ctrl+F1= Infinite Health
6)Ctrl+F2= Infinite Special attack
7)Ctrl+F3=Infinite team attack
8)Ctrl+F4=Freeze Timers..
9)Ctrl+F5=All Bonus Shields..
10)Ctrl+F6=9999 Tokens.....you can change number in trainer window
11)Ctrl+F7=1 Statue...you can change this number in trainer window..

*note*the statue thing doesnt always work right itll show you have whatever number you enter however at the end of the stage it doesnt always show that amount which means you may have to find all the statues yourself..but hey the rest works great...took me almost three days to get the cheats for each lvl of the game..which means i had to play the whole game and get the cheats for each lvl...it was a pain in the but ..but fun to make this trainer and look forward to making more.also if you wanna adjust the values of your tokens and statues during gameplay simply hit Alt+Tab and do so..also note that you only want the value of the statues to be what the max is for that stage..say it says you have 4/12 statues then only make the value 12 at most...

Thats it Enjoy!!!Happy Gaming....
