An update to my previous release. Plus the new Character Pack

----------------------

Welcome to Simpsons Jeopardy! This game is based on the Simpsons Jeopardy! board 
game. The only problem with the board game is that it was difficult to play 
alone. That problem is a thing of the past. Here are some of the features of 
this game...  
 
* 1 to 3 human players - the balance made up of computer players.  
* 20 playable characters from the show.  
* Modeled after the popular "Jeopardy!" game show with regular, Double, and 
Final Jeopardy!  
* 200 categories with 5 questions each plus 50 Final Jeopardy questions = over 
1000 questions!  
* 5 levels of difficulty for computer players.  
* High score board.
