,wenndi,2008-01-21T14:28Z,"Hey guys, been looking for this game since ages!!! However, do u face the same problem as I do?

I find the game runs a lil' sluggish. It's way to laggy!

My current system's running on a pentium 4 Windows XP. I read somewhere that this may happen. 

Is there anything that can be done?"
,pawlik4u,2008-03-17T02:50Z,"I've found the solution for that lag problem !!
Set the properties of your Street Wars to ""Run this program in compatibility mode for Windows 95"""
,Zensch,2008-05-30T17:50Z,"Thanks for the upload.

Works perfect for me under Vista Ultimate x64."
,StayPhrosty,2008-06-26T05:27Z,OMG THANK YOU SOOO MUCH! I used to LOVE this game! I only have an old scratched demo disc and this isn't in ANY stores anymore. TY soo much!
,Dickkwikkwek,2008-09-01T00:41Z,Works perfect! I installed it on my MSI Wind netbook and it runs great. Old skool games like this are still cool as hell. I'm having so much fun with this game. The fact that people still play these games proves that graphics aren't everything.
,Vallgeran,2008-11-01T09:17Z,"I just spent a good 30 mins trying to dig this game out of storage, sadly never found it, but thank god I found this. :)"
