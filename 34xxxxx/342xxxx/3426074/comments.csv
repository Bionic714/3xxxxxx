,pmsbull,2007-01-05T12:06Z,"THIS IS A FANTASTIC ALBUM. Whispering Bob Harris R.I.P. ( of R2 and Old Grey Whistle Test fame ) calle this ""the greatest undiscoverde album of the past 10 years"" when he played a few tracks from it. OGWT played a major part in my musical education. That man KNEW what he was talkng about.
ALSO CHECK OUT RITCHIE'S OTHER ALBUM ""UNDISCOVERD SOUL"". (Wonder why he called it that then?). Alot more commercial sounding but still a fantastic album."

Then again, maybe I'm too old to rock 'n' roll, but too young to die ......"
