,lx470,2006-02-12T22:14Z,"I get the error message ""failed to initialize graphics system. make sure your video card and driver are compatible with directdraw""

I've downloaded/installed everything mentioned above, and did everything suggested online to fix the problem.. any idea if it could be something wrong w/ the download?"
,Daddel,2006-02-22T10:33Z,"Bah!
Wasn't this suppose to be the ""Age of empires hte conquerors""!!!???

Its age of kings, as far as I can see."
,Daddel,2006-02-22T10:39Z,"Ahh, I'm so sorry!
This torrent works perfectly. I used the wrong .exe.
Sorry.
But, is conquerors just an adon to the age of kings? Do you have to have age of kings to install the conquerors?
I thought that the conquerors where a separate game. Am a bit lost. Thanks for hte torrent anyways! :)"
,Daddel,2006-02-22T11:47Z,"How do I get this thing working online?
When I try to play on msn gaming zone, it asks for a update. I downloaded the update, but when I try to install it, it says ""The retail version of age of empires 2: The conquerors is not installed on this system.""
I have installed and tryed the game. 
What shall I do??"

No sound? Extract the soundfiles by running setup.bat.
No expansion? Run age2_x1.exe instead of age2.exe - fagtard."

[T],muffda,2009-06-18T20:07Z,whats W9x
,ryu_8000,2009-08-27T08:58Z,"Everything is working fine 
use Winrar to extract file then setup to install game
inside installation folder execute setup.bat and fonts.bat and wait for it to copy files
to play AgeOfConquerers use age2_x1.exe and to play AgeOfKings use empires2.exe"
