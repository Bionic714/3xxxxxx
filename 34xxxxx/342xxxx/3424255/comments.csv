,looking54,2007-12-08T18:05Z,"this game reminds me of a cross between def-con and c&c , with a little hint of fallout"

,oneofearth,2008-11-28T10:19Z,"extracted the same as fallout 3 torrent rar's, but at the end, theres no exe's or anything here. generally you just unrar all the files in each folder and the exe will show up, click and install, then replace the exe with one from game copy world (crack)

that wasnt the case for this download... hmmm..
any ideas?

Also, thank you for this upload, and thank you seeders, got a smooth 150 kb/s throught dl."
,oneofearth,2008-11-28T10:29Z,"from what ive gathered, all you need to do is use win iso to convert the bin file into an iso then burn it/run and install, once again, cheers changoboy, this kind of x-com/blitzkrieg/fallout game seems well fascinating, cant wait to try it out ;)"
,RZK88,2009-01-10T20:36Z,A very nice game! Does anyone have the add-on? Cuban missile Crisis - Ice Crusade? I would gladly buy it but I can't find it anywhere...Maybe someone has it and can upload it? :)
,Hyung,2009-04-06T09:50Z,"can someone please tell me in very easy to understand, detailed steps on how to install this? All this download is doing is sitting on my desktop enjoying 1.49 GB of my hard drive. lol"

,kenqks,2010-01-23T13:00Z,how do you make the console appear for the cheats?
,sourfaith,2010-01-25T00:38Z,seed please
,oweng1980,2011-06-09T19:28Z,"hello guys do you have the files for ""The Day After"" game, reaaly thankful for someone to upload that game, thank you"
,Rotfuchs,2011-09-03T17:15Z,"it works. use power/ultra-iso to convert the bin file into a iso. than you can make a virtual cd, image, or just burn it. install it and use image or cd to play.
it`s in english, and kinda like the old blitzkrieg series."
