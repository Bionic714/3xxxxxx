-TAGLINE-
	"Two crippled brothers, one indestructable force, revenge against all odds."

-WHAT THE BACK OF THE CASE SAYS-
	The Crippled Masters, a film inspired by the success of the 1978 Crippled Avengers, tells the tale of two men who are skilled in the arts of Kung Fu and betrayed by their corrupt and evil King. The King's punishment for the two men is to cut off the arms of one man and to destroy the other man's legs with acid. Despite their obvious disadvantages, they join forces (literally - one sits atop the other's shoulders) and use their martial arts skills to take revenge upon the evil master. A disturbing and perverse film, that is irresistible to Kung Fu/Martial Arts lovers. Don't miss the action!!!

-WHAT REALLY HAPPENS-
	Standard kung fu fare, but with half the limbs.

-Notes-
Ok, in case its not clear, this is not some low-brow gimmick to poke fun at the handicapped. Oh no. This is a real kung fu movie, and the actors are really crippled. Somehow they found a guy with no arms (except for a tiny finger coming out of his shoulder)and a guy with legs that are no more than a layer of rotting skin on his bones, and got them to do kung fu together. I really don't think that there's anything else that needs to be said about this. So gather all your friends, grab some beer, if you live in a dorm be sure to watch this in the lounge or at least with your door open, put your conscience away for 90 minutes and enjoy this truly unique Classic!
