,Evil Genie,2006-01-31T21:26Z,"Any other of Bergman's early movies ? Like Gyklarnas afton, Ansiktet or Sommarnatens Leende ?"
,Malum,2006-02-06T05:36Z,"This movie is classic, one of my all-time favorites. Grab this."
,ady001,2006-03-25T02:36Z,One of the best films. Two tracks mean twice the fun!
,brancaleone,2006-03-30T15:54Z,"Seeding, anyone? I'm stuck in 95% for a week.  "
,MoeBrooklyn,2006-04-23T15:26Z,Does anyone know how to add the english subtitles to the movie?? Please help..I am really looking forward to watching this movie

R.I.P Ingmar Bergman"
,3bord3,2007-07-31T09:44Z,"Please use VLC player to be abel to chose audiotrack (or other player with this option)
Search Google for VLC player. I have never encontered a avi file that VLC player couldÂ´nt play or other videofile for that matter. No codecs are needed with this player.

The subtitels have to be in the same directory as the movie and have to be called exactly the same name."
[T],sickboy88,2007-07-31T19:17Z,"Wow, a sudden interest in his work now that he is dead.  I am glad people are finally watching this so many years after I have uploaded it."
[T],sickboy88,2007-07-31T19:35Z,"If you just want the swedish sound, you can do this:

1. Download virtualdubmod, for free here:

http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=65889

2. Run it, drag the movie into it.

3. Go to ""Video"" then ""Direct Stream Copy""

4. Go to ""Steams"" then ""Streams list""

5. Select the second one, then click ""Disable"" then click ""ok""

6. Go to ""File"" then ""save as"" then put in a new name like ""New Movie"" then click ok.

It will then output the movie with only the swedish track, and you can use your favorite player without hearing both tracks at once.

Don't forget to delete the subtitle files also.  Also, if at any time virtualdubmod warns you about an mp3 header, just click ""No"".

Hope this helps."

,Korrupted,2007-08-03T14:16Z,One of the greatest movies ever
,zeiderguy,2007-08-28T09:43Z,"Your movies are out of sync, lol."
,lucidskies,2007-08-30T05:00Z,"ya its good
but lol on the subs... they called blueberries strawberries "
,madmax999,2008-03-30T21:08Z,I'm not sure if I should upload another copy of this to TPB.  I have a very good avi copy of this that is very simple.  Swedish spoken and english subtitles.  The quality is quite good.  Is anyone interested?
,cliffdogg,2008-04-13T09:35Z,"Max- that'd be awesome. Much easier to burn, at least."
,nachos-n-cheese,2008-05-05T22:39Z,can anyone tell me about the quality of the subs? are they accurate?
,logan993,2008-08-14T20:25Z,Seed please.
,shale,2008-11-08T23:18Z,"If anyone else (like me) has trouble getting the .sub subtitles to work, just go to allsubs.org search for ""seventh seal"" and you'll find some in .srt format, then just put them in the original movie folder, and make the file names match. worked for me."
,Superstarz,2009-01-05T14:38Z,Thx a lot!
,Conloria,2010-04-07T03:48Z,It is just very annoying to get both audio files playing at the same time and I don't want to have to download another piece of software just to watch this movie. Please next time warn people beforehand!
