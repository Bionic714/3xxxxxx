A great swedish classic by Ingmar Bergman.  This is a must see.

I put TWO audio tracks in this one.  The first track is SWEDISH Audio, the second audio track is an ENGLISH AUDIO DUB.  If You don't like dubbed movies, yet do not speak Swedish, I have also included optional external ENGLISH subtitles in VOBsub format.

Mini Plot:

A Knight and his squire are home from the crusades. Black Death is sweeping their country. As they approach home, Death appears to the knight and tells him it is his time. The knight challenges Death to a chess game for his life. The Knight and Death play as the cultural turmoil envelopes the people around them as they try, in different ways, to deal with the upheaval the plague has caused.
