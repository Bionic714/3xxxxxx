    Focusrite Saffire VST plug-in effects 
              
              
    Compressor mono / stereo 
    ------------------------ 
    Modeled on the Focusrite's  hardware devices, using the  measurement of 
    custom optos to  achieve the signature  Focusrite sound. All  Focusrite 
    optos are tuned  by ear, just  like in the  old days of  analog design, 
    ensuring a faithful recreation  of those classic vintage  1960s optical 
    compressors.  
              
    EQ mono / stereo 
    ---------------- 
    With  the  same  signature   as  the  original  Focusrite   EQ  curves. 
    Focusrite's  R&D   team  used   state-of-the-art  numerical   transform 
    techniques to create  an authentic response  across the entire  audible 
    frequency spectrum.  
              
    Reverb    
    ------    
    Based on classic algorithmic studio reverb designs.  
              
    Amp Modeling  
    ------------ 
    Overdrive, speaker simulation and classic passive guitar  EQ-Emulation.
