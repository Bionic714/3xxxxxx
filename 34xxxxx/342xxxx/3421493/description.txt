ORBITER is a free flight simulator that goes beyond the confines of Earth's atmosphere. Launch the Space Shuttle from Kennedy Space Center to deploy a satellite, rendezvous with the International Space Station or take the futuristic Delta-glider for a tour through the solar system - the choice is yours.
But make no mistake - ORBITER is not a space shooter. The emphasis is firmly on realism, and the learning curve can be steep. Be prepared to invest some time and effort to brush up on your orbital mechanics background. A good starting point is JPL's Space Flight Learners' Workbook.

These are the minimum requirements to run ORBITER on your computer:

    * 300 MHz PC or better (Pentium, Athlon, etc.)
    * 128MB RAM or more
    * Windows 95/98/ME/2000/XP
    * DirectX 7.0 or higher
    * DirectX compatible 3D graphics accelerator card with at least 16MB of video RAM (32MB or more recommended) and DXT texture compression support.
    * Approximately 60MB of free disk space for the minimum installation (additional high-resolution textures and addons will require more space).
    * DirectX compatible joystick (optional)

There is nothing to prevent you from trying to run Orbiter on a computer with lower specs, but the results are not likely to be satisfactory. 

This torrent comes with base, SDK, and textures.

THIS IS THE FULL DISTRO & NOT THE UPGRADE!
