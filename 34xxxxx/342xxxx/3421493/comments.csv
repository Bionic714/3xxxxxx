If you want to play the most realistic space flight sim that has ever existed on any platform a good place to start is wikipedia or here:

http://www.orbiter-forum.com/

There are THOUSANDS of good, user-created addons available totally for free including most any fictional, concept or actual spacecraft or planet. WARNING! INCREDIBLY REALISTIC! A novice should be prepared to dedicate substantial time to learning about orbital mechanics and the like. You're not simply going to blast off, aim the pointy end at the moon, and hit the gas! Youll be out of fuel without having ever even gotten CLOSE! HAHAHA! HAve fun! "
