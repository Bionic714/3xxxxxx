Tan Feng (Chan) decides to help Dorian Tan Tao-liang, a shaolin student whose abbot has murdered by a Manchu traitor. Tan wants to help him because the Manchu traitor killed his brother.A part of their mission is to help a scholar make it safely across the river without getting killed from the Manchus..For more information go to wing-chunws/Hand%20Of%20Death.html"
