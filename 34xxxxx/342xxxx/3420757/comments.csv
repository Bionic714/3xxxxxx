,Sonny McBiscuit,2006-01-24T09:25Z,"What's the different between this this cubase? and the other 100 mb ones of the same version (3.1.1.944) other than the video tutorials? Is there any?

Also, not enough people are seeding "

,JRippa,2006-02-27T13:18Z,"Why does it stop when Cubase tryies to load, It stops on DirectX Plugins!!!!

Damn it.......can somebody tell me what 2 do...PLZZZZZ.....!!!"
,karmarockone,2006-03-07T00:53Z,"Version works great, except for some reason the computer reboots itself while using the program sometimes.... Anyone else have this problem? Any suggestions?"
,blackline,2006-03-14T10:58Z,Anyone who know if this one works on Mac Os X?

,SweetNucca,2006-04-14T03:42Z,3rd level tutorial is corrupted. Downloded the entire DVD twice to be sure. But about a gig of the tutorials are useless and the interactive player for the 3rd level tutorial is fried too.  5 (out of 26) will play... :p
,debben,2006-04-17T16:31Z,"

,elefantsnablar,2007-11-10T12:49Z,"Är det här fullversionen? Nån sa att det var ""Try Before Buy""."
,DolphWulff,2007-11-17T13:30Z,"I'VE TESTED THIS, AND IT WORKS ON XP 32-BIT, AND VISTA (ULTIMATE, PROBABLY ALL OTHER EDITIONS AS WELL) 32-BIT, BUT ***NOT*** ON VISTA 64-BIT. I HIGHLY DOUBT THAT IT'LL EVER WORK ON *ANY* 64-BIT PLATFORM, INCLUDING XP 64-BIT, AS THE ""CRACK"" IS A DONGLE EMULATOR IMPLEMENTED AS A DRIVER IN WINDOWS, AND IS SPECIFICALLY WRITTEN FOR 32-BIT SYSTEMS."
,Niosis,2008-03-20T23:21Z,Crashes too much... going to try the other version.
,coresh,2008-03-29T12:12Z,"Works GREAT! Not a problem, and the video tutorials are super. Great Job!!!"
,xeno12,2008-04-21T03:32Z,"I have used this since H2O first released it and it work without problems. People with Midi sport Interface will get problems thou. ""Like me"" but i changed back to my internal sound card Midi interface instead.

A short notice, if you get internal errors and it crash it's highly probably due dongel driver isn't loaded nor your computer sux . And Never get Cubase with a ""Crack"" or patch cause that will simply won't work ever.

To bad this is the final Cubase release from H2o.. Cheers to you guys for the hard work you have put in!"
,braaimanook,2008-05-09T18:19Z,"Absolutely brilliant although seemed reluctant to work from Daemon Tools, had to burn DVD and then it works as it should. As far as I have checked the tutorials also appear to be fine"
,djblunt,2008-05-12T09:54Z,"First let me say thanks for the upload. It works great, except for one thing: Whenever I try to rewire Reason 4 (which I also got from here) it won't ""rewire"" I get a message stating: Engine not responding. Check your Rewire host."" That would be Cubase. Why won't the two work together? They were meant for each other. I know the obvious answer is that it's not a legit version of Cubase nor Reason, therefore Murphy's Law is applicable. Has anyone else had this problem? Does anyone know how I can get the two to work together? PLease help. Thanks in advance. Funny thing though, Reason DOES work with my Cubase SL2 which is a legit version-go figure."
,djblunt,2008-05-12T15:26Z,"^update: I uninstalled Reason and installed a different version. in short, IT WORKS! The version I originally installed was from here and it was by ""Delirium"" I believe. The second one I installed was from here and just titled Reason 4 iso. So, for those who want to work with Cubase and Reason 4, this version of Cubase and the torrent titled ""Reason 4 iso"" is a good combo. You'll know the Reason torrent by the comments, someone posted a bunch of serials that DO WORK. I know this is not a real ""forum"" and is meant for comments, but I hope my comment saves someone the multiple headaches I had."

,tibbz,2008-05-18T10:46Z,"for those of you that get the ""engine not responding"" problem like dj blunt when trying to rewire reason into cubase try this out (make sure reason is closed first):

1) go to DEVICE SETUP in Cubase
2) click on VST AUDIOBAY
3) un-check ""Release ASIO driver in background""
4) re-start"
,BORNintoMUSIC,2008-05-22T01:36Z,"DolphWulff,

Only if the code doesn't have 16bit programming in the device.  If everything is 32bit, VISTA 64 should run it."
,Nael3r,2008-05-29T05:40Z,"Alright, I've tried installing the thing, and when it tries to go through with the installation for the dongle drivers, it says it the search has failed, but it still proceeds with installation. So finish installing everything and reboot my comp, but when I login and when all of the programs start up, it alerts me. The heading of the alert says ""SRV#001"", and the rest says ""CLED error"". On top of that the tutorials wont play, it says Macromedia Player error report everytime I try to play them, and the closes it.  help!"

,SpaceYeti,2008-08-10T16:59Z,"What the deuce, I can't get this to install at all.

It's a UIF, so I tried mounting it in MagicISO, and then exploring the disk, but it's giving me an error:

""H:\ is not accesible.

The file directory is corrupted or unreadble.""

If this is corrupted, I'm going to be pissed, it took quite a while to download -_-


Anyone have any tips as to how I could manage to get this thing installed?"
,SpaceYeti,2008-08-10T17:20Z,"Oh I had another program already mounted in the drive, I just opened up a new drive, mounted, and then explored.

So never mind."
,leonsaba,2008-08-19T18:33Z,"Hi guys,
no one have the cubase sx 3.1.1 crack for win XP Pro 64 bit? Ineed it... my 8gb of ram dont permit me down grade to XP 32 bit... Pleeeeeease...

;) Thanks a lot
Bye"
,kumako,2008-09-28T14:59Z,Thanks!
,Kaolccips,2008-11-18T17:16Z,"The SYNSOACC.DLL in this torrent is the TR/Crypt.XPACK.Gen trojan just to let everyone know.
Which is probably the reason why the crack did NOT work, which why after I installed, it kept saying I had protection issues (no dangle.)  Which made it so I couldn't even open Cubase.

So I went back to extract the files to set up the crack with this h2o version, and I found out the cracks are indeed trojans.
No thank you.

Currently checking out this full crack torrent to see if it works:

,Kaolccips,2008-11-18T17:19Z,"By the way, the software itself does not seem to be corrupt.  Everything installed fine and is working, I just need the crack for the dangle.

(I'm using XP Professional SP3 by the way)

So don't let my past comment sway you away from this torrent.  It's a working Cubase version, I'm just having troubles with the crack.  Which will hopefully be cleared up with the full crack torrent also on this site."
,garvet3,2008-11-22T03:29Z,the movie works!! but i was locking for the cubase program

,Oriax666,2009-02-13T07:44Z,Seed!!!
,Leenix20,2009-03-20T19:40Z,"I finally found the solution guys :) To Vista and XP 64 or 32 bit.

1) Get this torrent. It is Zipped up all it needs is just to extract, and as small as hell, no more downloading those bullshit 1gb Cubase Torrents.
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4212016/Cubase_Studio_4.1.1_by_Antony_GR_(Portable___Non-Install_version


Then go here and Download the Asio4all Driver.
It wil Reduce Latency on Which All Midi Works.
Meaning if you use Ezdrummer as a trigger for your Electric Drums and have 1 Second delays, this is a MUST. Even if you dont have Edrums YOU MUST INSTALL IT.
http://www.asio4all.com/


Now for Ezdrummer.
Get this Torrent, it Includes Both the Ezdrummer Installation and the Drumkit from Hell which is 100 times better than the standard Ezdrummer Kit.

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4565497/ToontrackEZdrummer1.1.1-Mac-and-PC-with-DKFH-Full_with_Serial



And Finally update Ezdrummer with this Patch, it will add a couple of new features in Ezdrummer and make a noticable sound fix to your drums.

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3815569/EZ-Drummer_Update_1.1.1_-_PC_and_MAC_(Universal_Binary)



No more need to look here and there for shitty torrents that dont work on Vista. THIS IS THE SOLUTION FINALLY."
,BadOZGirl,2009-07-20T22:04Z,Unfortunately the installation stops responding on Vista Home Premium 32bit..... I have also tried in compatibility mode with no luck.... :(
,Tapac,2009-08-19T22:29Z,"There is huge discussion about Cubase 3 does´t work on vista ultimate. Well mine OS is vista ultimate 32bit and I almoust skipped this software version of Cubase. But i didn´t find newer versions so desidet to give it a try. It came really fast and i just run the cubase setup through daemon tools and did nothing else to it, no cracks no nothing. then started cubase and it works perfectly!!! Maybe i was lucky...? Thank you uploader and all seeders!"
,Tapac,2009-08-20T01:06Z,I ment Cubase SX ofcourse!
