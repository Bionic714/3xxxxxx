,Bob_Obeys,2006-05-28T14:45Z,"wtf, the 4 leechers stopped seeding as soon as they got to 100% ...."
,Bob_Obeys,2006-05-28T14:50Z,"Ok, they just left..... what kind of ****ard are they?    Download and run? I need this for my IR tower....... please someone seed...."
,Bob_Obeys,2006-05-29T06:53Z,"Alright, i spend half a day searching for a way to connect to RCX 2 without the whole disc. And found  a solution. First, get the usb ir tower driver(already downloaded if you have the first 99.1%--where i get stuck at). Then, google for Brix Command Center and install it, download firmware and have fun!      Hope it helps. O_o"
