For all of you that "lost" the disc... :)


LEGOÂ® MINDSTORMS? lets you design and program real robots that do what you want them to. With the Robotics Invention System 2.0?, the core set of the LEGO MINDSTORMS product range, you can create everything from a light-sensitive intruder alarm to a robotic rover that can follow a trail, move around obstacles, and even duck into dark corners. 

This is only the software, you have to get the bricks yourself :)
This is the complete disc, with a patch included.
