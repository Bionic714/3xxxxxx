Sawai Miyuu was the live action actress of Tsukino Usagi/Sailor Moon to the series, "Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon." The following is her 6th Idol DVD.

In this DVD, Miyuu travels to Indonesia and takes a big interest in their culture. She shops at a local market place, experiences their cuisine, interacts with Baboons, and even takes a few lessons in Balinese dance while dressed up from head to toe with the traditional attire.

Throughout everything that is going on, there are also little dating simulation segments happening with Miyuu where she treats you as her sempai and directly talks to you. She cutely acts things out and answers many questions that you supposedly have for her.

Of course, this would not be an Idol DVD without the modeling, so there are plenty shots of Miyuu modeling in various swimsuits but that's not all... You'll also get to see her modeling in a Basketball outfit while playing and cheerleading for herself as a cheerleader. I must say that the wardrobe department did an excellent job on the selection of all the outfits as they are very cute, suit her and her surroundings perfectly.

Miyuu fans should definitely not miss this DVD!
