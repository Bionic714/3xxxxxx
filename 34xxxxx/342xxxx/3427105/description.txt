  ?  Eddie Jobson has always been one of my favorite keyboardists. This versatile musician can play progressive rock, jazz or even New Age. "Theme of secrets" contains very dreamy electronic New Age tracks, showing evidence of progressive elements, although there are no drums, no guitars, no violins and no bass: actually this record could be a reference when it is time to define what is progressive New Age. He uses state-of-the-art technology for the year, on the occurrence the synclavier: it gives multi-layered, mystic, mysterious, melancholic and nostalgic tracks, with just a small amount of never frightening darkness. Jobson creates here atmospheric & ethereal textures through symphonic and melodic sequenced patterns. It is absolutely not linear nor monotonous. This music gives you a bit the same feeling involved in the listen of David Helpling's "Sleeping on the edge of the World"; the difference is that Helpling is more linear and floating; Jobson is more symphonic. There are some variations on the same theme. 

Eddie Jobson is a genius: he shows us here that he is not only technically very skilled: he shows us that he is also able to give a soul to his music, which materializes itself in the easiness for the listener to be transported into another Universe. BON VOYAGE AU PAYS DES REVES! 

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
