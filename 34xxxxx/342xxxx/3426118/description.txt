Deepfreeze restores your computer after a system-crash.
Just reboot your system and it is in a working condition again.
There are three different flavours of this program.
Standard, (evaluation-version only, sorry)
Professional and Enterprise.
The standard EVAL version has a time-limit of 60 (?) days
the Pro and Enterprise versions are fully operational.
There are a lot of help-files available in PDF format.
There are also deep-un-freeze programs added, see
