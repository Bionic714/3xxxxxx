,MaXMC,2006-01-02T22:53Z,"This game has serious issues...
It randomly crashes and hangs although they've patched it twice allready."
,AC_COBRA_427,2006-01-02T23:14Z,"How can you have downloaded it allready, just curious? "
,Sh4d0w,2006-01-02T23:16Z,this game works perfectly dunno what probs u got =/ (and maybe he downloaded another torrent)
,AC_COBRA_427,2006-01-02T23:17Z,aaa sorry i did麓nt clicked my way into newtorrent.info
,Submariner,2006-01-03T08:55Z,"Yes. We need to just get the crack.

Many people already have the TWINS clone

and just need the small crack file from reloaded.

I checked megagames and gamecopyworld but 

they don't have it yet. Someone please get them the crack or else upload it here in a seperate torrent so we don't need to download 2.5 gigs to get a 200k file.

Thanks. "
,spunky1a,2006-01-03T11:25Z,is UFO-Aftershock multi language?
[V],robbie1412,2006-01-04T13:20Z,"It is a crack at Gamecopyworld , for the 1.2 version of Ufo aftershock , tested it and it works fine ... Just get the 1.1 and 1.2 patch ;)"
,BigFuzzy,2006-01-05T01:19Z,"MaxMC: It doesn't crash for everyone. I had serious problems with it until patch 1.2 which is out now. I've played many many hours since then with only one crash.. But that's not discounting that there may be problems with your particular system... 
You just shouldn't generalize so quickly.."
[V],snajp3r,2006-01-07T14:14Z,"there is no such file as ""sfdrup""...
This aint working.."

,Egobent,2006-01-10T02:59Z,"Cant get game to run ... I have downed this version of the game, but it just wont run... I just load for like 2 sec. and then jumps out to XP again... 

Do i need to burn it and have dvd in drive before it can run or have it mounted or something? "
,expresh,2006-01-10T22:00Z,either way this game is bad news
,crib,2006-01-12T21:27Z,"wtf? VERY VERY NICE SEEDING
!"
,insomniaklad,2006-01-15T15:50Z,"Expresh - The error means that your video card can't handle the ARB rendering routine, try setting it to something else. If that doesn't work, I'd say that game just hates you. :D"
,GHANJAH WARRIOR,2006-01-24T16:12Z,ANY CHANCE OF A RESEED ON THIS?
