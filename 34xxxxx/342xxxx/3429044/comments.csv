There are 3 trackers used for the torrent now, hope this speeds things up a bit.
Have fun and seed a little."

,Bulake,2006-01-08T20:40Z,"Thanks for the work man, I've been using your builds since I modded my bOX. Best damn compile out there.

With regards to this build, my scripts do not work anymore. I can see them in the menu but when I select them nothing happens. I wonder if it's a bug?"
,GasGiver4711,2006-01-09T00:01Z,"Bulake: Can´t reproduce this problem here, works like a charm - if you aren´t, try only using the complete unchanged files from the release."
,djchase,2006-01-09T01:34Z,nice release love it...playing my music nicely..froze once but no worries..the thing is that the skins wont load it says*Icompatible skin. We require skins of version 1.30 or higher* what do i do???
,MrEko,2006-01-09T02:15Z,"GasGiver, your Version is great. I love it! Can you please make the Names of the Online-Radio-Stations over the full screen size. The Names are mostly cutted like ""Dance trance inter...."". Or can i change it in a Script to make the Names in full lenght?"
,bv8oz,2006-01-09T07:37Z,"Thanks alot for your contributions to the scene, my x-box has looked very professional ever since i found out about your releases.  Cheers for all the hard work."
,puttekula,2006-01-09T14:16Z,Tack för ytterliggare en bra release. Inte provat denna än men har du/ni problem med att subtitles till DVD inte startar direkt?? Jag får köra SKIP framåt och sedan tillbaks för att få subtitlen att fungera från början.
,GasGiver4711,2006-01-10T23:36Z,"MrEko: if you keep the cursor standing on the line, it begins to scroll the complete name.
Isn´t that enough ;-) - I dunno what to do to make the lines longer, there isn´t much space left on the right anyhow ..."
,GasGiver4711,2006-01-10T23:37Z,"... *blerg* ... not ""anyhow"", it´s ""anyway"". Damn Germans ;-))"
