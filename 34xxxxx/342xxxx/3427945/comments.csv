,speakeasy,2006-01-05T21:41Z,"OMG - ""The image required 800 exposures taken over the course of 400 Hubble orbits around Earth. The total amount of exposure time was 11.3 days, taken between Sept. 24, 2003 and Jan. 16, 2004."""

You have somehow managed to get this completely wrong.  It's an image of a piece of the sky roughly 1/10th of the diameter of the moon as seen from earth.  Details here:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultra_Deep_Field

Also, a still larger TIFF is available that has the complete data from the entire survey in one image here:  http://www.spacetelescope.org/images/html/opo0428b.html"
