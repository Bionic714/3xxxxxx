,Mw1993,2010-06-19T16:19Z,"Good upload, but the German isn't German :) That's some other Germanic language, but it's deceiving to put that it's German. If you could find out what language it actually is and change the name, I would appreciate it :)"
,aapton,2011-02-22T20:44Z,"Indeed, this language isn't German, it's Dutch :)"
,ibutton,2011-04-16T17:31Z,"a/v 8/6 No hardsubs here thankfully, and the video quality is a step better than for bob-ic's 1940 upload, but still noticeable artifacts on color ramps."
,ozgeorge,2011-07-04T22:22Z,"If you want to remove the hard subs just remove all the srt files. It then plays beautifully in spoken English language only.
Nice upload bob-ic. Thank you very much.
