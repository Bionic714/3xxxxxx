I downloaded XviD but its really strange, itÂ´s just a lot of files with no setup or install program  "
,dannowyn,2007-09-17T20:49Z,Try downloading CCCP (Combined Community Codec Pack) and use Media Player Classic that comes with that pack. I think MPC is better and a lot easier to use than VLC

,LezDawson,2008-11-14T20:36Z,Sigh.  Who decides to use these stupid video and audio formats.  This prevents hundreds of users from playing these movies on our hardware DivX players through our TVs. Stick to AVI/MP3 please! :)
