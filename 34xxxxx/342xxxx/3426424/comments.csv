,Deadeagle,2006-01-09T16:33Z,"I have downloaded the beta once and it had lots of bugs. But if you are bored to the real Half-Life 2 you
might want to try this. Has few ""new"" weapons and items, which Valve removed because of this leak."

,YarrKodak,2006-09-03T00:30Z,"I am already seeding this, and have been since 2006-05-06, so stop whining for more seeds. It's not gonna happen. I seed as much as I can. Keep in mind I do not solely seed this torrent; I have lots of them seeding at once, and I've only got 8Mb/s max upload, so stop whining; I am seeding. With one seeder, and the occasional other seeder I've seen, things usually aren't fast. But I'm not stopping anytime soon, so it'll get done."

Kliener's lab, would only load once, now it won't show up anymore. At least all the weapons show up.
Does anyone know where a more complete beta exists? I've heard some of the anon ones got
messed up by people not downloading it right, then they upload their damaged version.

I've seen videos of better versions of the beta out there."
