[V],kaz-opu,2006-01-26T22:22Z,Nice one! Thanks....
[V],kaz-opu,2006-01-27T07:11Z,"Don't download this shit!!!!

It mostly contains books as ""Sams Teach Yourself Visual C++ 6 in 21 days"", and that book is from 1998..... WHO THE HELL WANT SUCH AN OLD BOOK?? NOOOO ONEEEE!!!!!"
,yabber,2006-03-10T03:10Z,124 RAR files? Yesh! Could someone post an index of the ebooks included?
[V],DarkSnow,2006-03-16T09:27Z,"kaz-opu: Dont want it, dont download it. It is an all-round collection of various books, and to my knowlege one of the few at TPB. If you dont like the contents, uppload your own stuff and stop bitching about it (contributor or not, pay some respect)"
,fsi,2006-04-02T01:49Z,"And just to add, for anybody who isn't sure: Just because some of these books are quite old, that doesn't mean they're out-dated. In many areas relating to programming, not a lot has changed in years."
,gurgel,2006-11-23T01:14Z,"DarkSnow: That's just a pretty retarded comment. How the heck is anyone supposed to know if s/he wants it if there's no index or any sort of list depicting what book titles are in this torrent?

Duh.."
,szteelsos,2007-09-15T17:53Z,Seeding please that torrent. thx
,Ganellon,2009-03-06T22:49Z,"At the time this was uploaded, it's relevance in the programming world was questionable. Now, it is simply outdated. The fact that it's made up of 124 rar files is absurd; you have to download the entire crudball to find the one book you might have wanted, only to realize you didn't want it after all because it's out of usable service. There are many, many better programming ebook torrents available; look elsewhere. This is crap."
,Ganellon,2009-03-07T05:53Z,"To its credit, this collection has a substantial library of Visual Basic 6 books from beginner to expert covering a huge range of topics.
