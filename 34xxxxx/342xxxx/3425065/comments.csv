,elijd,2006-05-04T17:56Z,"I wouldn't call this a ""conspiracy theory revealing movie"", instead just evidence against what by now has been the ""truth"". And by far some great points Dylan is showing us.

I must though say, that afterall, I think the US goverment, or who so ever planned this attack, uses more time to erase or hide evidence - which could reveal who actually did the attack - than thinking of evidence, movies and whatever, that already have been brought out in the daylight.. Guess it'll be very hard to find evidence against who actually did it.
Take in consideration of, that almost every ""evidence"" which did happen after 911, is only eye witnesses states about what they might think they heard and saw. Else everything is based on, what did happen BEFORE 911.
If it was a planned demolition and some american retards who planned the attack on their own country, I think they've thought of the point ""evidence AFTER the attack - how do we get rid of 'em?"" So it's only a matter of time, before the last pieces of evidence will be destroyed, hidden or people who ""know too much"" have been silinced for ever, simultaneous with the truth about 911..

,geggysteww,2006-08-19T11:44Z,"First and foremost I would like to say that I spent 4 years in the United States Marine Corps. I enjoyed every moment. I defended my country with honor and joy.

I will never bash any country saying that we are better than anyone, like everything there are good and bad people in every bunch. I'm sure every redneck, rebel flag waving, Bush voting person that reads this will flame me for that. But I garauntee you that the Romans too thought their reign on civilization would last forever.

Now as far as this film is concerned, I think that it was as well made as it could have been with the talent of the directors and the information they had at hand. Ofcourse people are human, and humans make mistakes, we all do it. There are a few things in the movie that don't add up or are mis-stated

I mean really, do you think everything you see on the history channel is 100% fact? There are going to be omissions and things that aren't, nor can be fully validated.

I have this to say, never believe wholly what anyone has to say about anything, listen to their story and then check the facts for yourself, and don't always rely on the mass-media to give you the entire truth.

And you would be kidding yourself if you thought that governments throughout history haven't enganged in acts of violence against their own people, and then turn around and blame it on a ""Boogey-man"" in order to snatch away civil liberties and tighten it's control over the population.

Hitler burned down his own Reichstag, in order to blame it on the Pols-

Nero burned the City of Rome and blamed it on the Christians-

The Gulf of Tonkin incident was falsified in order to get the masses of America behind a war in Vietnam.

So please don't fool yourselves!!

And since 11 Sept 2001, what have we recieved? the pat act, and encroachments on our so valued civil liberties, in order to ""PROTECT,"" us from terror. Right.

So I leave you with this.

I wish the military had a liberal enough mind to show this to the soldiers when they play alan jackson songs to poor ass mac-media videos that only show one skewed perspective. this video is much more valid than the rhettoric I see daily.... But why think anything other than those people died in a terrorist attack? I mean millions were hurt over images, people died, art was born, theories birthed, tattoos permanently imprinted, how could it ever be wrong? didn't Nixon also take advantage of a situation and put us into a wrongfuly entered war?"

,TheModGod,2009-08-13T07:15Z,"TomTomX - The first thing that the screw loose change video film maker bitches about is how Dylan used footage without permission that is copyrighted, way to start off the argument.

From ""http://www.lolloosechange.co.nr/""
""The reason why I went through the trouble of creating a subtitled version of Loose Change and this website is because I am a firm believer of facts and evidence. (No your not)  I do not care for vague assumptions, theories, or possibilities, and neither should you.  When you try to label the government for being a butcher and slaughtering 3000 of his own people, you better provide concrete evidence (absolute proof) to back that up.""

Take out all the ""Conspiracy Theory"" aspects and the story still does not ad up. Go get and buy a basic physics and chemistry text books and you will see this without having to see a picture that is obviously too big for your mind to comprehend, so take a step back. Jet fuel does not melt steel to bring down a building at free fall (No resistance) speeds.

There is no such thing as concrete proof, also known as absolute proof or irrefutable evidence anywhere in the world in any known field of any knowledge to date.

Dylan is not the first person to come to these conclusions for them self. There are many other videos, or better yet, books on the subject where the same basic conclusions.

David Icke - Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Center Disaster. -- Here is a another book (if you read that is) to check out what happened. And I can assure you a 600+ page book has far more information in it than a one hour video. 

Do some research on subliminal advertising, because if you believe mostly without question what you see on the television, then were all fucked. George Orwell - 1984, is here.

,pirateradiorocks,2010-06-19T20:20Z,Thank you!!  
,nnj,2010-12-22T00:51Z,"An even more important documentary to watch about the take down of the Twin Towers is ""9/11 Demolitions"". It is a more scientific, less dramatic account of what happened. If you have a reasonable mind it is IMPOSSIBLE to watch and not end up with questions.
You can watch it free here (I have no affiliation with movie or website)

The idiots are the ones who believe mainstream propaganda especially the BBC (British Brainwashing Coorporation). Watch some other channels like Russia Today and see constant contradictions to mainstream media. You will find mixed oppinions and real journalism, not scripted one sided views!"

,bravo2011,2011-09-13T18:19Z,"I watched this film, thereafter I had to shake my head and erase it. It's filled with some facts and tons of speculation and quotes taken out of place to mislead people. The only people that have bought into this garbage are wannabe intellectuals and people that have thrown out all common sense. This film has zero consideration for the victims of this horrific incident. I will not seed this fairy tale."
,pirate-1-2-3,2011-09-16T18:26Z,"I have a feeling, just a wild hunch, that the anti truthers fit into at least 2 out of 3 of these categories: 

1,) They watch Fox News
2.) They believe in god
3.) They are very religious"
,koreydavid,2011-09-24T03:22Z,"It is certainly not that the planes never hit the towers, because the documentary clearly illustrates the planes hitting the Twin Towers.  It is simply claiming that a building made out of steal has never collapsed due to structure fire in the past.  Watch the movie before you ask questions, it only makes you look ignorant."
,TheCritics,2012-09-07T18:01Z,"they didnt say that planes didnt hit the WTC, they was saying a plane didnt hit the Pentagon. IDK what to believe, but i do know one thing YOU CAN NOT TRUST WHAT THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT NOR WHAT THE ZIONISTS RAN MEDIA TELLS YOU."
