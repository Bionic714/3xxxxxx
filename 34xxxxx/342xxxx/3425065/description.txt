READ IT! ***I have re-uploaded this because I had to include the link to Dylan's website - this was the only request Dylan made when he generously allowed us to carry LC2E torrents at this early stage.Please support Dylan's work by visiting: http://www.loosechange911.com - DVDs start at only $2 each for bulk orders. Please could everyone make sure that this request is honoured when making torrents of LC2E.***

***Some folks in here have a nasty habit of spamming my posts with false virus warnings, and would eventually, possibly, try to get me banned from this place. I upload A LOT of material about 9/11 being a staged event, and they seem to trigger a lot of those false virus warnings from users named "b2pilot187" and "transcout" (they're probably the same person). Now, he is obviously either a disinformer or simply just the everyday-idiot, because my files are videofiles, hence impossible to infect with a virus. This user has been reported to the admins of this place, so I hope this matter will be setled sooner rather than later. Until then, simply ignore this person. But I would urge anyone not to ignore a virusscan in any event. I suspect he won't even read this, because he simply searches for "911" (and now "Alex Jones" too) and spam each and every post with these warnings. Hence, you will probably find another one below, in the comment section.***

What if:

The Twin Towers were not hit by commercial airliners? The World Trade Center was brought down in a controlled demolition? The Pentagon was not hit by a 757? Flight 93 was shot down?

What if?

Three years after September 11th, the American People are left with more questions than answers. This documentary addresses those questions, as well as providing the evidence necessary to begin answering them. From the phony bin Laden tape to the lack of a 757 at the Pentagon, Loose Change wraps everything up into an hour of solid evidence.
