Well this Is the Completion Of 3-4 weeks of testing patches and trying to work out bugs in the patching and system in general.

This patch will give you Nforce 2/ 3 /4 ATA support and VIA ATA /SATA To boot the dvd and also after the install.

It includes the following patches by maxxuss:

- Kernel Patch v3 (SSE3,SSE2 Emulation v3, no NX/DX, CPUID & RTC Fixed)
- Anti-TPM Patch v1
- Bootloader Patch (skips SSE3 check)
-A directory on the root of the drive (Extra Kernels) containing the orginal kernel and SSE3 No NX/DX,And All the patches for the kernel so you can mix and match if you need to.

The kernel has all the patches applied so that it will be compatible with
the largest number of systems available from the get-go. You can replace
the kernel with the version with fewer patches after installation if you
wish. You can create your own kernel using maxxuss's patchfiles set in the Extra Kernels Directory
