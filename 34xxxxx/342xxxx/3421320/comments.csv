,johngalt1994,2006-01-25T00:42Z,I can't get this to work.
,drstock,2006-03-08T18:01Z,"Works fine but the installation text is a bit crappy. The ""HD Serial Number"" is actually the Volume Serial Number that you can se by typing ""dir c: /p"" in a command line window."
,OwenJ1985,2006-03-08T23:29Z,"I apologise for my stupidity, but I'm continuing to have problems with this crack. Particularly the Sracgen part of the instructions (then run SRACGEN and modify the license from the command prompt with syntax ""sracgen license.dat""). Would it be possible for someone to explain this? "
,RedFro,2006-03-21T18:51Z,"Yes, could someone with a clue please explain how the whole 'run sracgen.exe and modify license.dat with syntax...blah blah blah"" works?  Thanks."
,RedFro,2006-03-28T07:20Z,"Actually, I sort of figured it out.  First you modify the license.dat with your HDD volume number as per the instructions, then you simply drag and drop the license.dat file over the sracgen.exe file.  The command window will appear briefly, and then you can copy the license.dat file into the License directory of CosmosWorks. Voila!"

,silmon,2009-07-16T11:21Z,"Do everything same as in the text but put the crack folder in the license folder of COSMOS! Then do the necessary changes in the license file and drop on the sracgen.exe. After that put the license.dat into the License dir of the COSMOS. Finally click on the LicenseAdmin program in the same directory and highlight the ""Authorized Modules"" and using Edit button choose your license file and click the Refresh button. It will works!!!"
