The quality is not great for a dvd rip, if this is such, and the deinterlacing is VERY noticable on a flatscreen. i would say its like a very good vhs transfer.

bottom line. well worth downloading

,nOmArch,2008-05-24T20:38Z,"ok i've just deinterlaced the file with Vdub and it looks 10 times better.

definitely well worth the download."
,Sjorsio,2009-01-14T13:42Z,"im at 99,9% for couple of days now (no joke). can someone please seed so i can finish it, i would very much appreciate it"
,bychance,2010-12-11T00:00Z,"Fake, don't download."
,DELTALEE,2011-01-09T06:57Z,How can 3 people have the movie and only 1 says fake.  What the !!!!
,acoronaplease,2011-01-22T08:33Z,the reason people put fake is because they are putting down files so you wont want to download them or they are retarded as fuck and dont know how to play a simple movie. 97% of the movies on here are legit the rest add or crap
