,murdok86,2006-01-08T15:28Z,tanx vodkaeye
,vodkaeye,2006-01-11T17:36Z,i didnt need to overburn when i made it as a last resort extract the iso to a folder then remake each seperate game folder into seperate isos but will take 3 dvds etc
,murdok86,2006-01-13T00:05Z,"After day's now i finnaly got this downloaded, but like eeee i can't burn such a big file, but i wonder how i can remake the extracted folders into new iso-files?"
,vodkaeye,2006-01-13T04:32Z,use simplexiso 
,vodkaeye,2006-01-13T04:36Z,if u have trouble finding it ill upload it
,vodkaeye,2006-01-13T04:38Z,then just tell it to make an iso of sam  sega  and unreal folders so ull end up with 3 isos
,vodkaeye,2006-01-13T11:42Z,u could also extract to a folder delete the xbmedia folder then remake the iso
,murdok86,2006-01-13T16:08Z,tanx again 
,murdok86,2006-01-14T15:42Z,"ok, i extracted the iso and removed the xbmedia so it would fit on a ""normal"" dvd. So far no problem."
,murdok86,2006-01-14T15:43Z,"But when i got into the menu no game works (i have tried from both hd and via cd, and used pal, ntsc)"
,murdok86,2006-01-14T15:44Z,"serious sam and sega says ""dirty disc"". unreal on the other hand only plays the intro over and over. So what da hell is the problem now? "
,vodkaeye,2006-01-14T16:38Z,can u bypass the menu use xbmc etc go into sam folder i.e and run the default.xbe for the game (use my files in xbmc when looking 4 default.xbe)
,vodkaeye,2006-01-14T16:39Z,ive tried it as my box set as ntsc and pal works fine on mine could also try ftp just a game folder over to ur box
,vodkaeye,2006-01-14T16:41Z,i know on couple of my m8s boxes they dont like menus
,murdok86,2006-01-14T17:24Z,"hehe, no that did not work either... but whats the problem with unreal, it starts and everything but you can only watch the intro. "
,vodkaeye,2006-01-14T20:33Z,on mine i just press start during intro and it goes to the press start 2 begin screen
,vodkaeye,2006-01-14T20:40Z,has anyone else had trouble with this so i know not 2 upload a menu disk again have u fted a game to ur box could it be a naff blank
,vodkaeye,2006-01-14T20:41Z,ftped
,vodkaeye,2006-01-14T21:00Z,wot did u use to extract the iso and recreate it
,murdok86,2006-01-14T21:32Z,i used winrar to extract then simplexiso to remake it to a new iso 
,vodkaeye,2006-01-15T04:08Z,"Well? here is your first problem... you have no idea what the other guy used to produce the ISO files.  He could have used XISO, XBOXIsoTool, WinRar, Adaptec Creator, WinIso, IsoBuster, etc.  They all produce ISO files.  Some better than others... but NONE of them do so in the same manner "
,vodkaeye,2006-01-15T04:09Z,that was a quote ive never used winrar to extract an xiso i use simplexiso to extract aswell dont no if thatcould be the problem
,murdok86,2006-01-15T12:03Z,"i used winrar to extract because when i tried simplexiso it said ""this is not an xbox iso"""
,murdok86,2006-01-16T17:00Z,has someone but me had a problem with this torrent???
,vodkaeye,2006-02-18T10:46Z,umm if simplexiso didnt work then it needs optimising with qwix first
,cyberxxl,2006-04-11T17:50Z,"can someone seed plz , stuck on 99,9% almost 4 days already"
,vodkaeye,2006-05-09T13:54Z,ive only just read comments give me an hour then ill seed it
,the_thingy,2006-08-14T22:23Z,"ehm.. reading the comments this seem to be a weird iso.. has anybody succesfully extracted it?
i just want serious sam 1... but it is almost unfindable.. oh.. and could someone please seed.. cuz there doesnt seem to be anyone.."
