Season 1 episode 3: Suitable for Framing (1971) (TV)
When a wealthy art collector is murdered, Lieutenant Columbo refuses to suspect the millionaire's ex-wife, whom numerous clues point to as the killer. He instead persists in pursuing the victim's nephew, prominent art critic Dale Kingston, who apparently has an airtight alibi for the murder. Kingston believes in his carefully wrought plan to frame his aunt, and refuses to believe that Columbo can be taken seriously. He is dead wrong.
