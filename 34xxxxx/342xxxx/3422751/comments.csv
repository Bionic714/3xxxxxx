What kind of shit eater are you!? The guy just asks a question, he's not saying I am a professor of English or anything, he asks a question that is perfectly understandable, bearing in mind English has a very difficult structure and syntax to master. Why would you go to the trouble of asking that question, what kind of a response to you expect? What kind of English is it? Broken English. So what. Can you please lick the shit off my arsehole thankyou. xx "
