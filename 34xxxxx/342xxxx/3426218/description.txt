My little brother is a little prick, and he like to always screw around with my stuff and whatnot, but he is very sensitive about his gamecube, he has like 40 games for it and he always talks highly about nintendo

So to get him back I bought a gamecube that was already busted but it was exactly identical to his current working one. I switched it out and broke it infront of him....

I replaced my brothers good gamecube with a busted one that looks exactly the same, and I smashed it. The little nintendo fanboy cried his fat little a** off............ Get the video and see the results.


This video has been featured all over the internet, and talked about in multiple forums. This is probably the highest quality version of it. Enjoy. :)
