Tracks 01 to 06 are obvious enough to be recorded over the radio. I understand that their was bad weather during the Billy Blue's show that effected the Billy Blue's broadcast. Not recorded from the KLOL studios. Remote location - Billy Blue's. Recording itself is a little bass heavy. Some distortion. Tracks 07 to 14 is an audience recording. At the time I did the trade, I was told that this version was new to the trade circles.
