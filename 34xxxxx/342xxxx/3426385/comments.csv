Fuck Capitalism and give Knowledge!
WE ALL HAVE THE RIGHT TO KNOWLEDGE!
Give a man a fish, he'll eat today, TEACH HIM TO FISH, and he will feed his family and teach his children to fish and they will teach their sons and daughters to fish. we are all Robbin hoods, we take from those that have and give to those that don't have! I commend all of you that give, what is bandwidth when someone would  like to learn something and ascend above the limitations of their meager income! We are the future! we feed, we seed, we see the need to be more than a human, to become a human being!"
