Prince of Persia: The Two Thrones :: Game Soundtrack

Music ripped from the PC version of the game on Dec/17/2005

* Ripped by doublemask
* thanks to -VAG for his riptool

I just used the tool from -VAG (thanks a lot man)
and joined some parts using ACID.
The parts that cannot be joined with others are 
the ambient loops which has ambient in the name
of the file.

I also ripped the credits song from the video.

Enjoy this SPECTACULAR soundtrack, while we wait
for the official one... I know I will ;)
