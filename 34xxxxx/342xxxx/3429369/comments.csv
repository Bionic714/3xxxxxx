,ZombiePanda,2010-03-07T09:37Z,"For some strange reason...the crack won't overwrite, it just becomes a shortcut and doesn't overwrite even when I change the name. :/"
,ZombiePanda,2010-03-07T09:37Z,"Never mind, I didn't even think about deleting the file before I pasted the crack over. xD"

                       I just downloaded and installed this one and it works GREAT!
                       After downloading open the file and then open the file named ""clonedvd2v2.4.5.3crackfff"". Then unzip with WinZip Pro with the ""1 click Zip"". The file was automaticaly unzipped and placed into the right file area. Zip! Zip! it workd perfectly. Hope this helps."
,azoozz,2011-04-05T23:10Z,Oh I already had a trial version of CloneDVD2 on my PC. I just made a short cut of the new one and no more trial period. not sure if the was the right way of doing it but it appears to work.
