,bjarven81,2006-04-05T15:52Z,"Hey
Iam not very good at this so could anyone tell me what to do with the files after the download."
,ks82,2006-09-22T21:35Z,"So nice !
this kind of software is so complex, and dedicated that you need to contact the company and politely ask them to develop some module to fit your business. so what the point for cracking this ? 
maybe it's some kind of advertisement that thay build up a new version ?"
,gixgix,2006-11-03T16:05Z,"Hi!
I installed Catia, no problems, but how do I crack it? It needs a license... The crack should be inside CD1, (as checkster wrote) but I can't find it there. I used winrar to get inside the bin-file. Should be a .dll file. Can anyone help me? Perhaps tell me how to find it or show me someplace to download it. Thanks!"

,gipsymarx,2007-01-11T05:18Z,"if install is freezing and failing, try disabling off mcaffee virus scan temporarily"
,100miles,2007-01-12T17:59Z,"Hi
When I start the installation, I receive the message:
""The procedure entry point ?ServerEnum@BasicLicenser@@UAEHPAPBDHAAH@Z could not be located in the dynamic link library JS0SPEXT.dll""
Could anyone tell me why I can not install the software?"

Thanx! "
,smithwhick,2007-04-13T18:49Z,"I opted to convert the bin to an iso and burn the image to a disc. When I run the setup I get the error ""Administration has stopped working"".

Here are the details:
Problem Event Name: APPCRASH
Application Name: CXINST.exe

Anybody else have a similar problem? I am running Vista Ultimate x86, but I figure I should be at least able to install it. I would appreciate any help. Thanks - Smithwhick"
,thod,2007-07-09T20:51Z,"Anybody who have the help files for catia? I know they are big but they would be great to have..
Or tutorials on the CAM interfaces that exists in catia."
,ukraine55,2007-08-03T20:42Z,"I am also getting the 
Problem Event Name: APPCRASH
Application Name: CXINST.exe

And I am running Vista Ultimate x32 i tried everything to make it work and it seems like it won't work on vista. (Sniff - Sniff)

I really wanted to try this software"
,Trollkarlen,2007-08-04T23:57Z,CATIA v5 is not yet Vista compatible. I think v5r18 will be the first version that runs on Vista.
,zizzle89,2007-09-19T23:05Z,"Is this the whole programme? I cant find the part-design toolbars anywhere, pad, shaft, pocket etc..

Where are they?"
,takeiteasy,2008-01-27T20:02Z,"Thanks for this one!
But...
I have problems, anyone who knows?
1.It loads for a very long time, my antivirus(?) is using almost 100% CPU -what's wrong?
2. I cant open *.igs -files ""Invalid data. No editor associated"" -it say's. -what's wrong?
3.Worst of all: all of a sudden, my screen turns black & my computer reboots, -what's wrong?
-It's like breaking the power, i loose everything i'm working with :(
-I would appriciate if anyone who knows what's wrong (and how to fix it) tell me!
-Thakns!"
,mazdatech,2008-02-01T08:25Z,"It works on Vista 64-bits, but not 32-bits.

Go to Tools > Customize... > Toolbars (tab) > Restore all contents... (button) > Press OK"
,viperkillertt,2008-02-06T22:24Z,"CATIA V5 R16 IS compatible with Vista!!!
I am running it right now. It  took me 6 months to figure it out, but the trick is installing in safe mode. Also do not turn on xp compatibility mode. It doesn't work with the xp compatibility mode ironically. I hope this helps you all. I love it. It actually opens up cool new features that weren't open in xp. I am amazed!"
,tyler0521,2008-02-07T22:35Z,"can someone please explain how to find the crack folder??? only two folders inside the CD1 .bin are 'code' and 'control', neither of which have anything resembling a crack or a .dll file.

please help"
,Tbagster,2008-02-10T07:15Z,"Hey guys. I was having the same problem with the administration failure and as viperkillertt said, it will install in safe mode on vista. HOWEVER, I am having a problem with the installation. Once it gets to the orbix ports, the default ones are wrong (according to the program) and it will not let me pass that part. Does anyone know how to get past this or how to fix it? Thanks!"
,viperkillertt,2008-02-17T10:16Z,You have to install in safe mode with networking. Then you wont have any problems. I have helped a few friends install now and it works perfectly!
,alminjo,2008-03-15T16:57Z,Is it possible to install this through D-tools and make it work on Vista ???
,bobdagangster,2008-03-22T06:24Z,"To install on Vista, you must run in safe mode WITH NETWORKING. (this is the solution to the orbix port problem...). I've installed it with Daemon tools."

,firecraker,2008-12-06T19:47Z,"In order to get CATIA to start after applying the crack, you need to allow CATIA to pass through your firewall. If your firewall blocks CATIA, you'll get strange entry point errors in the .dll file"

,wsussai,2009-06-25T03:00Z,"Thanks... Works great! I had some problems when installing without networking activated in safe mode, but now I installed and it is running perfectly. I read that its important to run it the first time still in the safe mode... "
