Inside the Alien-Human abduction agenda.? Incredible book detailing the more sinister aspects of the abduction phenomenon including military abductions, mind programming, manipulative implants, cloning and reanimation, and psychological/sexual torture by hostile aliens. Karla Turner tragically died of breast cancer in 1996, some suspect this was the deliberate termination of a dynamite researcher. It?s easy to see why when you read this book.
