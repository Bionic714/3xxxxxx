,ducati9ss,2006-01-09T18:24Z,"This one is pretty bad.
The picture is cropped and dark but it's the sound. There is so much hiss that you can't tell what has been said. Don't get me wrong, I'll never slam anyone for trying. Thankx for the effort!"
,mikeknoop,2006-01-10T02:50Z,"As if you needed any more information, quality (as seen in the pictures) has a dull, dusk overtone the entire film. Thank you for the torrent, first one I've seen for Hostel. Anybody seen alternatives yet?"
,deanfowkes,2006-01-10T05:32Z,"hey retards , it have nothing to do with the uploader masseur , its about the group who made it , pridevcd .

,homerdaisy,2006-01-10T13:54Z,"If he has quality product, then upload.  Otherwise, crap like this should be in the garbage...........oh oh, there goes the truck now."
,podisaras,2006-01-10T15:26Z,how can i unrar so many files???????????????????????????????
,atsfan,2006-01-10T19:27Z,Use Winrar.......... OKay. I just watched this and the quality is very very bad. Audio and video.. Half of the time you cant make out what is being said and you cant see it.. I would wait until a TC comes out. 
,shotts11061969,2006-01-12T04:30Z,i downloaded this and it only showed half the screen .anyone know of another download of this movie
,thinktwo,2006-01-13T05:25Z,What would you expect? It's a CAM!

,saataan_,2006-01-14T12:40Z,"Can any of you guys tell me how to unrar so I can watch the film? I have winRAR. In other films there usually are a ""part 00""-file, that you extract and then the film starts, but there's no ""part 00""-file in this torrent..."

[T],Knaster,2006-01-22T03:30Z,this bad a quality shouldn't even be allowed to exist. What the hell i even seen better cams than this!
,WizHole,2006-01-22T16:21Z,"Cam, TC, TS...If ur lookin' for good quality search for DVD-R-movies instead! Or at least a DVDRiP!"
,trance_rulez,2006-01-22T19:35Z,"hey! where's the seeders?! shut the f**k up guys, stop complaining and get a life!!!"
,trendkiller,2006-01-23T18:55Z,"Seriously... if you guys are too *retarded* to work a simple program such as WinRAR to unpack a release, then what the fuck are you doing on this site anyway? Frickin' idiots...

Shitty quality on this one, but thanks for the release. I think I'll find a better one, if you don't mind ^^"
