Propellerheads Reason Refill viewer & unpacker. Early version, your mileage may vary. Worked on the ones I tried.

(From included text file)
***************************
1. you must be using Reason 3.0 or higher
2. place the .exe in the same directory as the orkester refill.

Confirmed clean through scan at http://www.virustotal.com/.
Let me know if you find otherwise.

If anyone knows/has a better version or similar program, PM me. Specifically, I need something to try to salvage bad format .rfl files.
