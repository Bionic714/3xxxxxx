,WhatTimeIsIt?,2006-01-14T08:24Z,"Yes, it's a virus that's so Sinister that it even deletes comments about itself at any place on the internet."

,SobaMan,2006-11-29T02:01Z,"This is not a virus.  This is, so far, the only Civ torrent I've DLed that has actually gotten the game to run.

Thank you much!

I'll seed it for a bit once I figure out how.

,theraphosa20,2007-08-28T06:31Z,"i down loaded some crack to my computer, and i reseved a fucking virus, had to empty my computer just to make it go away, if i could find that mother fucking hore to pig who create the virus, i would fucking ass fuck him for several years to come, that is so fucking stupid"
,bobbofly,2009-01-02T01:07Z,"Works & works well! Thanx, WhatTimeIsIt! I think a major portion of the civ cracks will work, long as you shut off your internet while applying the update, so you don't throw the crack off. (meaning update ver. 1.09 gets updated to ver. 1.27, or whatever) The update search function takes awhile, but eventually gives up. ('bout 5-10 min.) You just have to hold its little cyber head under the proverbial water til the bubbles stop."

,vanderon,2010-08-09T17:59Z,"Hello. I wish to asure everyone that this is the working solution to the  BINKW32.DLL error that you get when installing the original Civilization4 game. Searched the web for a few hours and this was the only fix that worked for me.
So a big bump! and thanks."
,genjutsu01,2010-08-30T23:58Z,"downloaded it, followed instructions to the letter, exact same error message as if nothing at all has changed, useless"
