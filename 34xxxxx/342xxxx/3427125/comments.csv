The Main Menu is really cool and has cheesy music playing in the background. lol
It's an Arcade room and shows all the original coin-opp games on this CD. Just scroll left or right to the machine that you want to play and ""kick some ass""

,esdraelon,2009-06-15T08:20Z,"I've been coming to the bay for a long time now, but for some reason never registered as a member. 

Probably because I'm a horrible procrastanator, but to some redemption, I have always seeded everything I DL, and that is no buttering up BS, but 100% honest truth. 

What finally compelled me to register just so I could post a comment, is for the first time I have had a problem with a torrent, being this one of course. 

I can do nothing with the crack to make the games work, and like mcfade said previously, star force keeps asking for a key. 

Man this would be so much more simple, straight forward, and logical, to simply include the damn key, instead of frivelously trying to copy the exe's from the crack, which absolutely will not work for me. 

So either I'm a tech retard, (which is possible) or I need the freaken disk key! Help! Please! 

I'm dying to relive my childhood and play these games!"
,esdraelon,2009-06-15T22:50Z,"Ok so I was being techtarded indeed, and not copying the exe's to the correct location. Got it figured out, and huge thanks are in order! THANKS!!! Great torrent! Am seeding as I speak."
,kalifani6,2009-11-27T13:10Z,Thanx!
