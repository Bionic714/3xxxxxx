,andy3856,2006-02-09T17:51Z,Why after overwriting the original .exe file with the cracked one does the ppc freeze when starting Tomtom? 
,ajwhiting,2006-02-12T14:37Z,"Same problem here, the install works fine until i copy over the cracked exe. From then on my ppc freezes when i start TomTom"
,a2000rick,2006-02-12T20:18Z,will this work with USA/Canada maps?
,eten_m600,2006-02-14T00:41Z,"Hi,

I am having the same freezing problem with the crack. What I have notice though if I pull the SD card out (the maps) and start the cracked version the application starts and indicates that ""Not any maps found"". This made me think whether the maps are causing the issue here. Nevertheless still having problems and cannot progress!! Becoming very frustrating! Anybody to help?"
,MKUK,2006-02-22T00:25Z,"that is only one file in the cracked folder, plz advise"
,maintenance,2006-02-22T17:50Z,"Ive got same problem,tomtom starts but  no map found.there are no files  called 'CurrentMap.dat' in the folder.
im using a micromaxx mdppc 150."
,caleyman,2006-02-25T18:01Z,"cracked it, just removed the great britain cfg map, working like a dream, "
,GordonM,2006-02-27T22:40Z,"never before have I read so much poor advice - especially from dvdgenie...

currentmap.dat is not in the archive
There is no 'crack' folder, just 'cracked'
TTN5 folder?? where is that then?

I removed the cfg file as advised still hangs my pocketpc... any other ideas to get it working?"
,GordonM,2006-02-27T23:00Z,I think only tomtom 5.2xx and over is compatible with MS Windows Mobile 5.0 devices so I'm goosed with this version...
,bleedingpegasus,2006-03-01T15:39Z,"makes me pull my hair! come on ppl, anybody come up with solution on why it keep on saying no map found?

,niatrinh,2006-03-06T16:30Z,"i'm trying to post a detailed help but its not working.

mail me at niatrinh@gmail.com and i'll send full instructions."
,niatrinh,2006-03-06T16:32Z,ok let me try that again in smaller chunks..
,niatrinh,2006-03-06T16:32Z,"hi all

those of you still having problems with this thing freezing your pda, i think i can help.

mine was freezing too and after much dicking about, i managed to make it work.

so lets start from the beginning."
,niatrinh,2006-03-06T16:33Z,"1) download this great post.
2) extract all files and copy to mem card on your PDA."
,niatrinh,2006-03-06T16:33Z,"3) i dunno how this autorun thing works coz it didn't on mine, i had to go to the 2577 folder and clicked on the CAB files to run and install them.
4) after installing all the cabs, get your CurrentMap.dat file from here"
,niatrinh,2006-03-06T16:34Z,5) http://www.funthing.co.uk/tomtom.zip
,niatrinh,2006-03-06T16:34Z,"6) inzip the tomtom folder with the currentmap.dat file and put the folder into your My Documents folder of your PDA (main memory - not memory card)
7) now copy the cracked exe file from the cracked folder to your DPA and that should be it."
,niatrinh,2006-03-06T16:34Z,"if you already have it installed and its freezing, then just download the CurrentMap.dat file from the link above and follow the instructions.

all being well, everything should work and you should never get lost down some dodgy backstreet ever again.!

,sst123,2006-03-17T22:26Z,"Despite everyones advice I still can't get this to work.  My ipaq just hangs following installation even with the currentmap.dat file in My Folder.

Anyone got any further advice?

Thanks,"
,Marvellous,2006-03-27T12:35Z,AT LAST I got it working!!! Found a message on a different torrent site ....... simply copy the 'TomTom' directory from the root of your PDA into your 'My Documents' directory - this works with WM5. ;)
,herc1,2006-03-28T09:15Z,"i also had  the freezing issue. Marvellous' directions (above) work like a charm. I also used the crack.exe (not sure if it needs it, but did it any way). australian users can DL aust map for their new navigator http://thepiratebay.org/details.php?id=3411443. simply add this map to your SD card. worked on xda mini with wm2003 SE."

,Yozza1,2006-07-06T20:55Z,Is this the actual TomTom Nav software program or only an update?

,mick01,2006-12-24T12:27Z,Will give it a go thank you
,haisaid,2007-09-25T18:55Z,"Works perfectly on Orange SPV M600.

But had to do the following:

1. Copy the unrar'd files to your SD card

2. Launch the 4 cab files using the device's file manager.

3. Go through the installation procedure, cancel when it asks about GB map.

4. Replace the ""tomtom navigator.exe"" file with the one in the ""cracked folder"".

5. Move the Tomtom folder from the ""My Device"" root directory to ""/my documents/"".

6. Launch application (from either the file manager or the programs list)

And off you go!

Thanks for the seed!"
,hijacked78,2008-05-26T16:07Z,"does this have complete postcode support, not just first 3 letters?
Is it possible to install the maps on tomtom app version 6?"
