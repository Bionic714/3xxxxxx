,sanitarium66,2006-02-04T01:53Z,"This one DOES work, Get it!"
,TakkerX,2006-02-04T22:15Z,"How did you get it working? I installed it, copied the crack, and after restart when i want to start wbconfig.exe it still drops the window where i can choose to reboot or reboot later....
Anyone tried on win xp 64bit?"
,gneps43,2006-02-17T13:05Z,This one is FAKE! Just the same shitty non-working crack as all the others.
,gneps43,2006-02-17T13:17Z,Sorry... It did WORK! You just have to do exactly as the readme file instructs.
,v0ice,2006-02-27T19:06Z,"Don't say ""It works!"" unless it works on all Win versions.. 
Say ""It works on Win XP!"" or ""It works on Win Xp and Win 2k!""
Cause this is definately not working on Win XP x64 bit version. At least not on mine, none of the cracks I've found does.
so ~gl hf to the rest :]"
,Galactic,2006-03-11T20:42Z,v0ice: It's not the cracks fault. Stardock will release a separate version for x64 in the future.
