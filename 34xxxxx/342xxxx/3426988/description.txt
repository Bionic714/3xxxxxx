This is not the typical Sonic show, this show features a more dark and apocalyptic world of Sonic where he and his pack are freedomfighters, fighting against Dr. Robotnik. The show was featured widely on the british channel "TCC" or "the childrens channel" during the 90s

These are the episodes i have from the FIRST season. Season 2 will be uploaded if needed.

I have one request though, there are some holes in the first season (episodes 9 to 12) that i would love to get filled. So if you have these episodes please contact me
