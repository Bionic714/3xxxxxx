,kaninen__92,2007-02-02T19:56Z,seeda fuck face
,homer88,2007-05-12T22:07Z,I figured it out.  Just drag the icon on the disc image to your Sims 2 folder and let it replace the old one.  That's how it worked for me.
,sophiezz,2007-12-09T10:05Z,"come on, pleasee seed!"
,morkovka55,2008-04-03T16:15Z,"The crack really works! I used to have all the problems that u described but now the game is running perfectly on my MB pro with Leopard. The way it worked for me was that i installed the patch first and when it asks u where to install it u should choose your current Sims directory which most probably is on your hard drive- applications. After that u have to start the archive file and run the crack.U then copy the crack to the Sims folder but keep in mind that if u copy it with its current name it will ask u if u want to replace the icon. And when u say yes it will respond that u don't have sufficient rights to do that. So thing u need to do is just copy it on your desktop , rename it (i just put one more space before the 2 ""The Sims  2"") and then move the renamed file into our Sims directory..after that start it and it should ask u to wait a few minutes and then the game starts....i did it this way and believe me i've tried all the patches and rev. e cracks....nothing worked except this one :) Hope u succeed :P"

,reeseypeasy,2008-05-06T16:55Z,"Hi I need MORKOVKA55's help please. Or anybody who could answer my question. I have a Macbook Pro running on Leopard and I installed The Sims 2 which had a Rev E crack, but when I tried installing it, it just quits. I heard from the comments that the crack only works on Tiger. Now I downloaded this because Morkovka55 said that this patch ran perfectly on his/her MacBook Pro, so I followed the instructions, and this is what I did:

1) Open the patch, install it in The Sims 2 folder in Applications.
2) Run the crack, then copy to desktop. Add space in The Sims 2 so it becomes The Sims  2. Then I copy paste it to the original The Sims 2 folder. 
3) I run The Sims 2 but it says please reinstall.

I am so stuck and I absolutely do not know what to do anymore. I am desperate to play this game again. It's been about 9 years since I last played The Sims, and I just want to bring back the old fun it brought to me. Please please a million thank yous to those who can help me out here. 

Thank you in advance!"
,pantsare4losers,2008-05-17T17:40Z,"The best advice I can give, is that morkovka55  was completely right. 

basically run the crack, and when it asks you to install (like how you normally drag and drop to your applications folder) drag it to your desktop instead. Name it anything, for instance mine is called "" cheeseballs"", whatever

drag cheeseBalls into your applications folder which  replaces your original and your all set
Works great for me, and I'm on a mac book pro running leopard. 

Anyone know how to get the expansions running tho? Cus I got no clue "
,hauptmann777,2008-06-10T16:26Z,I'm getting please insert original disk. How do I fix this?
,lilua,2008-06-20T23:56Z,"pantsare4losers, THANK YOU SO MUCH for your advice. The game is working perfectly for me now that I followed your instructions. Just one question though, do I have to register my sims 2 game because I got it from a torrent and don't have a serial? Thanks. Crack is working perfectly."
,Dafront,2008-08-10T21:25Z,I followed pantsare4losers' instructions and it worked. But ecerytime I play in about an hour I get Kernel Panic. I'm using iMac G5 with Leopard. Help?

,robozombie,2009-04-18T20:29Z,"Could someone help me?

I don't understand the instructions very well...

See, I installed Sims 2 from a Disc I copied from my friend, where Intel Macs didn't exist yet.

So i do need an Intel patch to run the crack?

also, i try to rename the crack and then put it on the same sims 2 directory, and it runs, but if i click while the opening cutscene is playing, the game crashes and quits unexpectedly.

It also quits unexpectedly if the cutscene ends.

So i can't get into the game.

I have an Intel iMac with Tiger 10.4.11

if Don't know, could you explain the instructions explained in the older comments with more detail? please Help!!! (:

You will win a cookie too! (::) :D"
