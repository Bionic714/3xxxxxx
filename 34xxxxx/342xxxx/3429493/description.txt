Return to Castle Wolfenstein: Tides of War (Xbox) 
Xbox Live enabled installment in the long-running Castle Wolfenstein first-person shooter franchise. Himmler, the Fuhrer's bloodthirsty SS chief, has dabbled in the occult to create an army of the undead-and only one man can stop him. You're B.J. Blazkowicz, a bad-ass Army Ranger recruited into the Office of Secret Actions. Your mission: blast across the globe and into the dark depths of Castle Wolfenstein-battling carcass-shredding mutants and death-wielding zombies-to terminate Himmler's demonic experiments. Turn the tides of war before it's too late.
