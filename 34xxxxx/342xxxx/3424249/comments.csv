,Quirky_Puppy,2006-01-19T13:20Z,WARNING! POLITICAL IDIOT BELOW LYING ABOUT VIRII BECAUSE HE DOESN'T WANT YOU TO DOWNLOAD THIS!!!!
,fargas-seeker8172,2006-02-05T03:21Z,"Dead-Inside is right. Conspiracy theorists are weak. Our government does not lie. It is truthful if you are truthful. We should do whatever our kind and honest leader says. If he needs more oil from under Iraq and Iran, we should support him and not question him. The government is love. Blindly go day to day without questioning anything or you are unpatriotic. Just bend over and take it like a good boy."
,MountainLion,2006-02-09T23:41Z,"Ok its simple, If you download this torrent and you start it in bitlord or similar, you will see that it contains 1 avi file. 
So its NOT a virus. 
So if this dude has an opinion, he does't say.

Keep Your Eyes and Ears open. Some things are tru some are for your to decide."
,rallyant,2006-02-17T11:48Z,"Id like to know why there are so many ppl that are so dead against ""conspiracy theorys"" doing looking at torrents like this?

its NOT a ""conspiracy theory"" its a conspiracy. any fool can see its try and not a theory.

Download! look for yourself and make up your own mind!
and as  mountain lion said 
""it contains 1 avi file. 

So its NOT a virus. ""

seeing so many posts with bullshit info about viruses gives me all the more reason to belive its tru."
,jassolaamanen,2006-02-28T04:55Z,"Watch this document, it's brilliant!

i wonder what can create that amount of heat since it makes nearby building catch on fire..."
,evilcr3ture666,2006-03-03T21:25Z,"transcout is an idiot, it is not a virsus, dont worry ppl"
,mtoivo,2006-03-07T17:37Z,"This document has some very fine footage i hadn't seen before. Worth watching, absolutely. Especially the way WTC7 penthouse fell down before the rest of the building..."
,Halbermunken,2006-03-09T03:37Z,"The ""failure"" to stop 9/11 suited PNAC agenda just fine. Remarkable considering arabs with nothing but mere boxcutters succeeded in outsmarting the entire USA defense system even though the pre-warnings were in massive numbers.

Here's some of the latest in the press:

,Sirerdrick,2006-03-24T15:13Z,"Ok, the government is trying to stop this footage from being released.  Does THAT not in and of itself lend to the credibility of this video?  I will go in with a fresh mind, but that might be a little bit difficult considering the press this is getting.

Governments representing a large group of people are always bound to become corrupt.  Humans are just not meant to live as we do in the ""modern world.""

If you enjoy this (which I still haven't watched) you should check out any of the books written by Jerry Mander.  I would suggest starting with ""In the Absence of the Sacred"" or ""Four Arguments for the Elimination of Television.""  "
,UK.DK,2006-04-03T04:54Z,transcout is a lamer don't listen to him.
,lostboy69,2006-04-04T01:55Z,"Folk who say there is no conspiracy theories are in fact correct, it is NO theory. It's all about power-wayyyy beyond mere wealth kids.
It's happening right in front of your eyes. Brainwashed fuck wits.

,lester_shangrila,2006-05-03T07:24Z,this is a good video
,lester_shangrila,2006-05-03T07:38Z,"You should watch this video. It is a good one and it can enlighten you about what actually happened on 9-11. I don't consider this one as a conspiracy theory because there are more questions that the US government failed to answer. And there are more evidences that contradicted the government's version of actually what happened. In this case, the government's claim about 9-11 is more likely to be the conspiracy theory.

Anyway, so much for that, I would like to recommend another video that I downloaded here before. It's the ""loose change 2nd edition"". You can also watch the video directly from google video if you don't want to download it. Here is the link: http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-5137581991288263801&q=loose+change

Just a piece of advice, please reserve your comments after watching the video. Just watch and listen carefully. Be skeptical but open-minded and enjoy the video."
,jebu.hristo,2006-05-15T02:53Z,"THERE*S NO VIRUS IN THIS MOVIE!

re: WTC collapses i dont think anyone in their right mind can suggest that aeroplanes did not crash into the buildings. Youre right. And you are also right that noone would make up the thousands of dead as a result. 

Anyone who trawls through enough white papers, videos & images, knows that; 

1) no aeroplane hit WTC7, it wasnt structurally compromised in the 1 & 2 collapse (see the buildings next to it), and it still collapsed

2) the aeroplanes that did hit the buildings were not sufficient to topple the buildings alone. WTC1 and WTC2 were built to withstand 2 x Boeing 707 impacts apiece and remain standing.

3) It is convenient that all of the WTC buildings (7 included) were destroyed just weeks after the new leasee took over the complex, and they were able to successfully sue for twice their insured value because of the two separate attacks on them.

i'm not saying that any of the stuff that obviously occurred (planes, people jumping to their death, collapses) was false, just that the reasons given by the establishment are not correct.

6 of the FBI's 19 named hijackers are still alive and well and have alibis for Sep 11 2001.

I would suggest that something is awry, when anyone who wants to show WTC7 footage on US TV is almost prohibited from doing so (see Steven Jones interviews)

I would suggest that something is awry when the computers that host videos like this are siezed, never to be returned.

This smacks at best of withholding important evidence from the constituency and the world and at worst is indicative of the conspiracy theorist's favourite - ""Cover Up""

thank you for the seed."
,awwgoddammit,2010-05-26T01:39Z,"I dunno kids. I'm all for thinking that anything is possible - esp. re. 9/11 - but Missing Links smacks as raw antisemitism. The language used in this film really points at Jews as a whole rather than just pointing at the Israeli powers that be.
I have a VERY open mind and this still makes me VERY uncomfortable!"
