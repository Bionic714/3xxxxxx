,Conformist,2007-11-11T03:59Z,"No reviews?
Alright, I'll download it.
If it's good, and I remember it then I'll leave some feedback.

Maybe I'll upload my own ''Killing them softly'' since my connection is almost never down which means continuous(?) downloading for others. :D"

,GregryBoy,2010-07-13T08:05Z,"Must ask why you would upload your own version of a torrent rather than just seed a torrent that already exists?! If there were significant quality issues that would be different, but in most cases you can provide the same benefit from your high quality internet connection simply by seeding! After all, this is the whole concept behind torrents to begin with!"
