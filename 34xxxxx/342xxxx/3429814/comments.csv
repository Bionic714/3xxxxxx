,zanoi,2006-01-10T04:04Z,"So why upload something that ""dosnt work""?"
,billbarstad,2006-01-10T04:48Z,"When I run it, it says to re-install from the CD then quits.  Phooey!"
,nemods,2006-01-10T13:40Z,"When i Try to run it says

Please re-run the TechTool Pro 4 Installer from the TechTool Pro 4 CD/DVD to correctly install the application.

TechTool Pro 4 will now quit.

Anyone know how to avoid this???"
,brattman,2006-01-10T21:12Z,"nemods & billbarstad:
maybe should try and burn it to a cd and then install?
I have no clue, but..."
,GraphMaN,2006-03-13T23:55Z,"Maybe burn the disc version?
Micromat TechTool Pro 4.0.6 Bootable.dmg.tgz"
,Punkpez,2006-03-19T21:55Z,"I made it work:
1. mount image and copy file to your apps folder (ignore error msg)
2. download Tech tool 4.1.1 update from Micromat's website
3. run update
4. run tech tool from applications folder
5. it will ask for a serial number, enter 488319386462643 (found on internet)
6. don't register and you're all set"
,alpharedx,2006-06-07T04:34Z,this torrent/program works great. I recomend.
,bl00dcl0t,2007-03-05T20:29Z,"I followed all of Punkpez's instructions, 'cept I couldn't update to 4.1.1, instead it only had the 4.1.2 update. I went with that one but it wont accept the serial number"
,DCwiExplorer,2007-04-16T12:45Z,"It works, but after the 4.1.2 update is applied. But be aware that you will need to use Serial Box to get a new working password, as the common passwords for 4.1.1 don't work for 4.1.2.

Also be aware that the program is up to verson 4.5.x, and there is no legit upgrade path from 4.1.x to 4.5.x. If you want the latest version of this program, this torrent won't do the trick."
,A140,2007-04-24T18:35Z,"The serial number I used to get version 4.12 to work is

488313464160857"
