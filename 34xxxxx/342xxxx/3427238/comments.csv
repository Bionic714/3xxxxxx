,Gandoon,2008-03-11T18:01Z,"Unfortunately I don't think I have all the files intact anymore.
I will see later this week if it is even possible to restart my seeding (though I personally think that you are allowed to abandon a torrent and count on others to keep it alive after seeding it more than 1000:1)
Hold on, and keep trying for at least a week or so."
,Gandoon,2008-11-15T02:38Z,"If there is public demand for something from this collection, please let me know and I will try to reupload some of these tracks.
As noted before, this torrent is dead if noone who has downloaded it before have it intact and could consider seeding it for a while.
I can upload the individual soundtracks if wished for. I don't think I will recreate this collection as a single torrent."
