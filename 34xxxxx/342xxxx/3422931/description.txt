Great classic Korean music video - real Korean people, real Korean places, real Korean themes and a real sense of Korean life and culture. Thanks to aheeyah for the lyrics translation. The song is about how a man and woman can stick together the way rice and seaweed stick together in a popular Korean snack food.
