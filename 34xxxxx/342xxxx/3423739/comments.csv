,Lambrusco,2006-01-07T12:07Z,"The uploaded file is OK. None of the files has 0 kB sizes. You should mount the image file in a virtual drive (eg: Acohool 120, Daemon tools,...) to check the downloaded files. Then you can burn it into a dual layer disk or compress to DVD5 with your favorite software (eg: DVDShink, DVD rebuilder...)"
