,mcdoopy,2006-01-27T05:57Z,"Thanks dashat, I won't download fullscreen movies.  Thanks anyways..."
,ztrakk,2006-01-27T08:09Z,"good day to serajewelks and all of u guys/gals! can anyone tell me, how to rip a dvd in such great quality?? i have dr.divx 1.0.6 and if i want to get such great quality, the size of the avi would be 1.3gb for a 90-minute like office space. but 692mb with such quality is imposible to me!!! thanks in advance :)"
,ztrakk,2006-01-30T01:24Z,"I am under the impression that Dr. DivX 1.0.6 is the latest DVD to DivX encoder and the codec, which comes with it ?which is also the latest- is 5.2. My media player is windows mp10."

,serajewelks,2006-03-03T21:32Z,"As far as quality goes, there are three words to explain it:

Two-pass XviD."

I'm connected to two seeds and one peer and getting over 75 KB/s"

Well, la tee da.....what a tool.

,bmnrocks,2007-03-26T20:17Z,"Thanks for the heads up on being full-screen, as I don't do full-screen either.

An example of why would be missing out on Ron Jeremy in Ghost Busters because it was full-screen when the wide-screen version shows him :-)"
,gabby1976,2007-12-12T00:17Z,can someone make a dvdrip file for this?
,miloman1010,2008-07-02T09:33Z,serajewelks ur such a fuckin dumbass. Two-pass XviD is two fuckin words. what the fuck do they teach you in yogoslavia. jesus...
,yoshimira,2009-07-12T17:45Z,"I am appalled at how RUDE people are on here... do we HAVE to sling insults like elementary children?
and it IS good to know if something is wide/full screen... different formats for different screens, etc.
I personally don't know one person with a 'non-widescreen' monitor or tv... so OFCOURSE I want to know what ratio i'm downloading... come on... lets behave like adults"
,trakerman,2009-11-27T23:16Z,Very god quality man !
