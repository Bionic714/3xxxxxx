,Skarmalius,2007-03-26T22:44Z,"For the last time guys... To play Ripped or other shit maked games on ur ps2 is impossible until u find a guy in ur town... maybe russian,or other european,asian australian, but not fuckin American person...and if he sells games or maybe his own burned games which is hard to find in usa... Just ask him... U do the mods for ps2? if he says yes... let him do it it probably takes 150 $ Or just buy in other stores if the people has Swap magic cd which allows ur ps2 to play not original games !!!! U really guys suck... I bet 5 years old could understand...well 8 years brother of mine nows it and burns games himself... Myself i burned like ~100 games and the hell i dont even know how many did that my brother... If u have any questions @mail me Arniukstis@yahoo.com"

,chuckn16,2008-04-02T05:07Z,Why is this taking so long?
,Gillamon,2008-07-02T13:57Z,"Hi Guys,

I also had a problem with writing this ISO to DVD and my chipped PS2 also said ""Insert a valid PS2 disk"". 

I first used Nero with no luck, then I used Alcohol120 also with no luck so I downloaded ""DVD Decrypter"" from http://www.dvddecrypter.org.uk/.

I set DVD Decrypter to burn ISO and the first time it worked. Haven't played it yet though but watched the first little intro.

Well I hope my info helped!! :)

Also weirdly enough it didnt ask me for a password?! I see some of you are asking for one. I used WinRAR.
