Featuring eerie dialogues and monologues by the brilliant but disturbed River Tam, the Sessions were a viral marketing campaign for the movie Serenity. The movie, available on DVD December 20, is a follow-up to Joss Whedon's much-loved but short-lived Firefly series, which was broadcast on Fox in 2002. Buy Serenity on DVD and support the underdogs.
