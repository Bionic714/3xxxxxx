This band is sooooooooooo great live !!!!!
plz!!!"
,psilocybonaut,2010-06-30T18:44Z,"Yes, it sucks that no one seeds these anymore.  Demonoid has lots of String Cheese that no one else has (which I used to be able to get without a reg), but I don't have an account and something changed and I cannot access it anymore.  If ANYONE would be willing to get me an invite code for demonoid, I would be willing to trade TONS of live SCI, Keller Williams, Widespread, Phish, moe., Umphrey's, STS9, Ozric Tentacles, much more just for an invite code.  If someone can help me with an invite code, please email me at psilocybonaut[at]safe-mail.net   THANK YOU"
