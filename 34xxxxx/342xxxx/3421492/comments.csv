,mmmva,2006-07-11T22:54Z,"Thanks,
although I having problem getting the game to start.
First of, when I try to play the game from Daemon it says that I should insert the game cd. Then when install the no cd crack. The message says that I can't find the proper some directories, when I go with full installation of the game it says that it can't find the video directory, then whit normal installation it says that it can't find the map directory.

Any hints on what I should do?"
,Solipsism,2006-08-07T16:54Z,"Do a full installation, then mount in daemon. Try with all emulations on, though I doubt you need them. Never had any troubles with that. Maybe doublecheck the paths in the registry? That could be messing up the crack as well."
,Solipsism,2006-08-07T16:56Z,Also try setting compatiblity mode to win 98.
,Solipsism,2006-08-26T20:19Z,www.closecombatseries.bet has been down lately but will return in a couple of weeks probably. Try www.closecombat.org.

CC3 has been my all time favourite strategy game - so i cant wait to get back to the eastern front!"
,Joppe_G,2006-10-02T23:14Z,"which file is it I mount? I've cracked the game but it still tells me that there's no cd, but i can't find the file to mount..... which one is it?"
,Solipsism,2006-10-04T03:17Z,"The .iso.. Full install recommended. Be sure to check the path in the registry, it gets messed up with XP. Search for Mattel Interactive in the registry-> close combat -> 5.00 -> InstalledTo. Change it if necessary. Compatibility Win 98. No crack should be needed."
,Solipsism,2006-10-04T03:21Z,"If it somehow complains about missing videos after that, copy the video directory from the data folder on the city to the installed CC5 directory."
,GinsuArclite,2006-10-17T07:51Z,"i cant find this .iso file, first time usen DAEMON.
i full installed, installed fix, patch, crack but dont know where this .iso is to mount.
'NO CD in CD ROM' any help solipsism?"
,GinsuArclite,2006-10-17T08:07Z,"nm i think i deleted it, fck"
,Solipsism,2006-10-18T15:41Z,Ok good luck! It should work with crack anyhow :) Otherwise try install stalingrad and see if it works without the cd then.
,rosalin,2006-11-21T10:58Z,"I have problems. Used Burn CD in Nero, and everything seems ok, The CD autostarts, and everything works till the install reach 100%. 
Then I get a message about the CC5.icd file.
Tried to install it in win98 , but it made no difference. What am I doing wrong?"
,Solipsism,2006-11-22T19:34Z,"Try burning another copy? Or maybe install with deamon instead? I've tried it with win 98, xp, xp 64 so shouldn't matter which os. Not sure about the copy protection, but if there's one it is an old one needless to say."
,murderdolls960,2007-05-03T06:12Z,seed plz
,knapret,2007-05-03T19:55Z,"I had to change the ""installed from"" drive letter in the registry to match my virtual drive before it would start."

,Ridskog,2007-11-26T16:24Z,"hello. i downloaded the game ran the patch, ran the crack, but i have some problem with the ""CC5.ICD"". even during the installation of the game it said that the game might be from a false medium. Then when i try to start the game it says it can't find the CD and when i browse i can't find the CD anywhere. I downlaoded the game from ISOhunt and there they never give you any imformation of how to install it. 

Does anybody have any idea what i should do?"
,sirpalm2632,2008-05-11T14:24Z,no problem...use daemon mount file .iso you can see in torrent what file is .iso  mount it! and have fun!
,primigenia,2008-11-03T17:11Z,"It installs fine witch the crack, problem is playing the game. The controls, including scroll, troop movement, orders and so forth, is delayed several seconds making it impossible to play. Im runing Nvidia 8800 GTS and OS XP. Also tryed to switch of all 3d acceleration, made no diffrence.
Anyone?"
,rusarmy,2008-11-21T21:11Z,"????? ???????! ??? ????? ?????? ?????!

Thanks, the previous one I've got wasn't working"
,SaorEire,2008-12-16T01:52Z,"Worked like a treat after a reinstall; didn't realise you needed to run the setup from the disc, rather than the autorun.

Just played a quick mission, and this is without a doubt, one of the best series. Immersion beyond imagination. 

Cheers for the up!"
,Synnista,2009-06-07T23:15Z,where the fuck is the god damn ISO? I cant find it
