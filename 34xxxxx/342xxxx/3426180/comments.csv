I down loaded and inserted the card as per your instuctions, but it still will not open. I get this message """"there is no application associated with Tom Tom, run application first, then open this file from within the application

Thanks"
[V],bitchucker,2006-01-29T00:44Z,"Endurance, buy or download TomTom Navigator 5. These _maps_ are addons to the application, not applications in their own right."

All the files were uploaded except the system folder where the system crashes and a message which says ''Operation failed - the item is not fromthe phone''. What is this mean?"
