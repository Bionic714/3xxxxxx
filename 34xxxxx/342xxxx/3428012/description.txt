This is my first torrent hope it works and that someone will enjoy it.

Audiofiles compressed to ogg vorbis-format(lossless) with CDeX 1.51 
Bitrate: 1411 kb/s

ISO-file ripped with DVD Decrypter. I've mounted the file and played it, without any problems whatsoever, using PowerDVD which should simulate a standalone DVD-player.

I'll be seeding for as long as I can but during weekends I have to shutdown my computer at night for reasons that is none of your business.

So please be kind and SEED..

Well, enough said.. Enjoy!!
