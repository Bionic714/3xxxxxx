,admiez,2006-02-07T15:52Z,"Are you sure these are ""lossless""? They are ogg vorbis but around 10-12mb each song they can't be lossless, must be be compressed @ a high bitrate."
,vikko98,2006-02-08T20:23Z,Bitrate: 1411 kp/s.. You don't have to download the files if you don't want to no one's forcing you..
,vikko98,2006-02-08T20:31Z,"I divided for fun... For example, take ""You oughta know"". That song is 4min and 9sec long.
The size of the file is approx. 14Mb. 14/4 = 3,5.
Is that enough for you?"
[T],unknown 200,2006-04-03T17:29Z,"Great shi*, there are in torrent ogg files, very bigs (with 14Mb and more). Why not in mp3 vikko98??? Thanks
