Lame 3.92     192 kbs

Group: Journey        Title: Time        Year: 1992



A 3cd-compilation from the biggest band of adult oriented rock music of all time. 

This is a must-have for every fan of melodic rock. It summons up Journey?s great 

carrier from the beginning in 1975 to their timeout in the late 80?s and contains 

songs from their officially released albums during that time, but also rare 

unreleased material up to that point.

Enjoy!
