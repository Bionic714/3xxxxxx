The first game of the Postal series. Banned in ten countries. Totally classic and uncut.

You play as the Postal Dude who is convinced that everyone has been infected with some kind of strange infection, and it originated at some Air Force Base. You know that no matter what the cost, you must reach the Air Force Base and find out why the whole world has turned insane, and turned against you.

The action picks up right at your little shack of a house. Police and federal agents have you surrounded, and the only way out is through a hail of bullets.


If you liked Postal 2 then you must have this cult classic.
