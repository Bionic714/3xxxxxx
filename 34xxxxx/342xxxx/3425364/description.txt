Whilst he has released most of his work under the Ultraviolence moniker, Johnny Violent has released one album under his own name. 'Shocker', released in 1996, contain a number of works regarded as too 'frivolous' for an Ultraviolence album proper. Bearing such good-time hits as 'Johnny Is A Bastard' and 'North Korea Goes Bang', the album ends with a world record attempt, with a track reaching 20,000,000 beats per minute at it's fastest point, Burn Out.
