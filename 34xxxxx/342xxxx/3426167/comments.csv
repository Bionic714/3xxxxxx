,BeOSDano0,2006-01-30T18:25Z,"Another good made-for-TV horror flick I uploaded is ""Don't Be Afraid of the Dark (1973)"". If you like ""Satan's Triangle"", then you should have this one too."
,red456,2006-04-16T10:57Z,"Have looked for this film for years, can't believe I found it. Thankyou! Any chance of a seed, we're all stuck at 86.2%"

Is anyone really seeding?"
,BeOSDano0,2007-01-09T04:07Z," I ripped the movie back to my drive tonight, so all of you who are stuck can finish your downloads. When you're finished, please seed for others this time. OK?"
,BeOSDano0,2007-05-02T14:56Z,"Due to popular demand...I ripped the file again, and will seed for another week or two."
,mrbig42754,2007-12-08T05:36Z,"I'm afraid I jumped on this a bit late. Can anyone PLEASE reseed this for me, it would be a real treat to see this. Thanks!"

,fC6tk9Jn7s,2008-04-26T03:42Z,Any chance of a 700 MB AVI of this?
,fC6tk9Jn7s,2008-05-01T19:13Z,"This is a TV capture from TBS which is missing roughly the first 3 minutes of the movie.  There is a 700 MB version at Demonoid (also a TV capture, but from the Sci-Fi channel) which has the first 3 minutes."
,yoncenator,2009-04-24T04:58Z,ya can I get a seed please? I'll seed till I upload 20GB if someone will get me to 100%
