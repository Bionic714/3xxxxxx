[b]Description/Info:[/b]

Call to Arms found Sick of It All refreshed and ready to rejuvenate its career with a faster, more punk sound that made the band's streetwise songs seem that much more urgent. Spawning the rather successful single Potential for a Fall (which even found its share of MTV exposure), the album suggested that Sick of It All's future was on an upswing. Unfortunately, much like Scratch the Surface, Call to Arms only made a small wave, but helped introduce a new audience to the traditional hardcore sound that Sick of It All had championed for years.
