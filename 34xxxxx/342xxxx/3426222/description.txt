This is an iso image (DVD) Of Met-Art Photos. This DVD contains everything from 1999 ( The Sites Start) Through 10-15-2002 . There are 432 Diferent Photoshoots and 24422 photos. You can  burn it to DVD using nero or a similar program, if you do not have a DVD burner you can extract the files using winrar or any number of other programs. I use UltraISO myself. but whatever floats your boat. this is a large file, it will take some time to get seeded. so if your not comftorble downloading such a large file, or don't like the ISO format simply don't download it. Otherwise Enjoy !
