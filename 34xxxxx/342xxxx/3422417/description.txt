Perhaps the most influential hip-hop recording of the East Coast hardcore hip-hop genre, The Infamous is Mobb Deep's breakthrough album. Embedded in melancholy lyrical content, gritty narratives, and haunting production, the album features several Mobb Deep classics, including Survival of the Fittest, Trife Life, Survival of the Fittest , Just Step (Give up the Goods), and Q.U Hectic. However, the focal point of the album is Shook Ones Pt II: a timeless street anthem that has since become Mobb Deep's trademark song. Often regarded as one of the greatest hip-hop songs ever recorded, Shook Ones Pt II has been heavily sampled, quoted, and remixed by numerous hip-hop artists. The Infamous represents a relentless song cycle that has since been hailed as the quintessential album of the East Coast hardcore rap genre, establishing its own cult following amongst Hardcore Rap circles. It is widely considered as one of the most defining Hip-Hop albums of the mid-1990s, establishing a slew of imitators and influencing several Hardcore Hip-Hop acts (including C-N-N).
