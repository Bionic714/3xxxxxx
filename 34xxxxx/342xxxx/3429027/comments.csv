,Greatest_Pirate_Hunter,2008-04-11T06:49Z,"Oh, man!  :(

About a month ago, I found a rip of the VHS rip of the video for this, but didn't download it because my hard drive was getting kind of full.

Now, it's not on here anymore!  :'(

If anyone has it, could you PLEASE re-upload it or send it to me or something?!  I'd appreciate it so much!

Thanks!"

,iloveguts,2009-01-09T16:48Z,"I had a couple of copies of this CD as well 
when I was in middle school.  I still have the 
same mp3 of The Murmur's version of HR 
Pufnstuf that I imported on my very first 
computer, which was nearly 10 years ago.  I 
thought I would have to buy this a third time.

I love this CD.  Thank you for uploading it."
,mistressofthebubbles,2012-04-02T05:45Z,Thanks so much. Almost impossible to find this version of the Ramones doing Spider Man...and the rest of the songs are just an awesome bonus. Thanks again :)
