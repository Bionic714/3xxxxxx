,Kauliaris,2008-08-18T22:37Z,Both 3 games work perfect.Yugis after the install needs to create registry entry(use the engine).Kaibas might not work at all on some pcs.Just rip it to another pc and copy to the none working one.All 3 are stand alone games but if u want to combine them(use all cards =711) there is a simple way.Just install them in one common folder(every game in his folder and all them in one).Play joys passion game and in the option menou use the setting for the full deck.Now close this game and open kaibas and Yugis for only once and when u re-open Joys u  will have cards from 3 starting decks and the AI will use 711 cards:P sorry for my english
