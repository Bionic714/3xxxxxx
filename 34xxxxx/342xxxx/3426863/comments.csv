Read the most basic book in earth sciences and you will understand how stupid this is. Moral values under threat is another sign. Many of these so called sacred beliefs is bullshit superstition. Some of them may have served a purpose during the old dark ages. 
But today they are nothing but dead and rotten rubbish. The humanity have been seriosly sick for thousands of years. If all the manmade idiotic religions got lost it would be a truly beautiful thing."
,Pirate 32,2006-05-21T19:40Z,"the bible predicted:
jews being kicked out in 39AD, city being destroyed.
jews being insanely abused for 1000s of years.  (Muhammad led the second jewish holocaust)
ww2
chernoble
jews returning to israel in 1949
""comunications would travel at speed of lightning""
explosion of knowledge of our time (~20th century)
people would abound the earth frequently at high speeds."
,Pirate 32,2006-05-21T19:42Z,"Israel would be surrounded by enemies.
In the place of Israels old temple would be a temple of satan. (dome of the rock)
the bad behavior of children today
people would loose their religious belief
the bad weather, tsunamies, destruction of coastline.
that the area of israel would be as ""of a stone of burden to the earth""
that it would make people near it act drunk and disorderly
societies fall into decadance, that right would be considered ""wrong"" and vice versa.

And yet to come...
third of earth burnt up in fire
beach-ball hailstones of blood and stones (nucleare physics experts predict that a MEGA bomb would do this)
a mountain falling into the sea, burning, causing massive heartache around the globe (look to the coast of portugal)
the almost certain destruction of the us
and many others..."
