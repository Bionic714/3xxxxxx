,Savooon,2006-01-07T13:25Z,"Thesé files are bogus files they dont contain any info, a mate took a look at them and it´s just zeros in them, so I´ll be very surprised if anyone got them to work."

,Robot234,2006-04-20T12:01Z,"Do not download this torrent. I got massive amounts of rubbish data, 17 of 19 GB for a 3,02 GB file (!). And when I finally got it down the files would not play at all. Stay away from this one! "
,saibot88,2006-05-04T20:11Z,"I agree we whit the rest, don't download.

I had problems whit the files to, and i believe it was the codec.
But... my program that tell me what codec to download said, ""no vaild media file"" hmm :-S

i think its the files that damaged

So u dont need to look after the right codec couse u will never find the right one :-P"
