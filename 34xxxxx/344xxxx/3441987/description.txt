Stephen King's Sleepwalkers  (1992)

   
This is the terrifying tale of modern-day vampires who prey on virtuous young women. Mädchen Amick is the sexually curious virgin who falls for the new boy in school, only to learn too late that he's a life-sucking Sleepwalker. Mutating at will from golden boy to savage monster, he stalks her to feed his seductive mother. As the tension mounts, the town's tabbies gather for a final, chilling showdown with the monsters in their midst - and we all know it's not nice to hurt people's felines...
