,Vic&Liz,2006-02-11T12:11Z,"yes, it's the sega version ripped from cd (we actually bought it) "
,Vic&Liz,2006-02-11T12:23Z,you should get it easily now. it is over 1500% health
,morientes652,2006-02-11T16:07Z,"how do i install the game?? when i have opened the file it just says it cant find the RNSVE.msi file, what im i doing wrong?? please help me with this!"
,Vic&Liz,2006-02-12T11:13Z,"morientes652> sorry, don't know. installed fine here. wouldn't post it if it didn't work. try updating your windoze/os"
,Vic&Liz,2006-02-12T13:27Z,"morientes652> you have to burn the file to CD. use we the UltraISO program. UltraISO will let you open the file (or BIN/CUE - CCD - NRG files etc) & also let you burn to disk (without nero/roxio installed). when you've burned the disk, insert it & let it autorun. instructions for the update & crack are on the disk :)"
,morientes652,2006-02-12T23:07Z,"i did open it in ultraISO but i coulndt find how to burn it. So i putted the files on the Desk and then just copied to a CD. i installed the game but i cant play it, it just says i have to insert the real cd-rom. i can open editor but not the game. can you help me with burning on ultraISO please? i know im an idiot that cant do that but you have to excuse cause im very bad in computers...."
,Vic&Liz,2006-02-13T12:51Z,"PART 1>>>morientes652> put a blank cd in your cd drive... choose Tools 'Burn CD/DVD Image' in UltraISO & point it at the ISO file... when done, go into 'v6.02 Update & No CD Crack' folder & run the update, then, copy fm.exe into your install directory (C:Program filesSports InteractiveFootball Manager 2006)..."
,Vic&Liz,2006-02-13T12:51Z,"PART 2>>> you can now play the game without cd & the game is updated. the instructions are on the cd. ps: if you can't burn from UltraISO, update it or use Nero/Roxio :)"
,juhl555,2006-02-19T01:52Z,"Please seed!! Stuck on 98,6%..."
,Vic&Liz,2006-02-19T10:35Z,have been seeding it non-stop since the torrent was made
,morientes652,2006-03-04T12:32Z,"I cant make it work, dont know why, but thanks a lot for the help!!"
,Vic&Liz,2006-03-07T14:18Z,"morientes> burn the iso image to cd with nero or ultraiso. remove cd then put it back in drive (it should autorun). install game. do NOT play yet. install update from cd. then, copy fm.exe file from crack folder on cd to where you installed the game (overwrite file already in there). you MUST overwrite the file otherwise it won't work. when done, you can play game without cd. if you still can't do it (it is easy), get a friend to help... :)"
,Vic&Liz,2006-03-07T16:09Z,"morientes> the update files & crack files are in the folder 'v6.02 Update & No CD Crack' on the cd. install update after installing the game, then copy file 'fm.exe' into the folder c:program filessports interactivefootball manager 2006' (overwrite the file already in there). it's that simple :)"

,undergr0und,2006-09-12T14:15Z,Is there anyway i can instal the v6.03 ????
,sjap7,2006-09-26T20:21Z,Thank you very much!! :-)
,Vic&Liz,2006-09-28T11:43Z,"undergr0und>>> re: Is there anyway i can instal the v6.03 ???? - 
dunno if we added the 6.03 no cd crack/update as we made this a while back - if not, you need to dl the 6.03 official update & find a no cd crack for that file. all i can say is... all no cd patches + updates on the cd we made work :)
