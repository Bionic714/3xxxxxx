(p.s. in many arab and muslim countries westerners earn as much as 8 times the wage of locals for the same job and same skill/education)"
,Pope John Paul 2,2006-02-07T14:01Z,"Same skills/education... Muslims?! Now that is a good joke. Harvard, Oxbridge, Yale, and Tehran Uni.....?"
,Pope John Paul 2,2006-02-07T15:02Z,"Amen to KataMaiL
And stop using the things that our god gave us the wisdom to invent: planes, cars, electronics, medicines, music, telephones, TV?s, light, the wheel, toilets, the Internet, electricity, watches, monetary system, clothes, shoes, cameras, trains, boats, telescopes, physics, computers, GPS, Xrays, plastics, fridges etc. etc. etc."
,Pope John Paul 2,2006-02-07T15:03Z,"For every time you Muslims touch a product/service/invention etc that is made/designed/pioneered by our god you insult your own by showing that he has been able to endow you with little other poverty, famine, disease and hatred. Look around you, touch only that which is yours and stop forever taking from us while at the same time waging a campaign to cast all back into the stone-ages. That you live, walk, get benefit/health payments from, and enjoy all that our God?s country has to offer is a direct insult to the paucity of your own leader?s virility and strength. No Muslim can go to their heaven after living a life shrouded by a different religion?s greatness."
,Pope John Paul 2,2006-02-07T15:03Z,"Think about it, take stock of you global achievements, think how many people want to move to your countries (where you rule)  and how many want to live in ours?. And be grateful. Or leave?.     Think about it, take stock of your global achievements, think how many people want to move to your countries - where your god rules - and how many want to live in ours... And be GRATEFUL. Or leave.
Look at the objects around you at this very moment - the pc in front of you, the cars in the street, the Boeing up above, the wrist watch on your arm...and so on. List how many say MADE IN MUSLIM LAND and how many MADE IN WESTERNLAND. Use any of the latter, and by definition you pray to our God and insult yours... Think honestly about why our God told us, and gave us the power and ability to invade Muslim Iraq -incurring fewer casualties than the number who die on the road in one month... Get with the winning team, or stop using our game ball and stuff."
,may71,2006-02-09T06:42Z,What happen if islamic countries stop selling their oil to non- islamic countries ? 
,katamail,2006-02-12T11:46Z,"NEW RULEZ!!!: 


1) Deportation of ALL middle east people ( let them suffer in their own country rather than us in ours)

2) Any monies owed to them put into a holding account to pay for the war vets of the gulf war and to the ones who gave us our real freedom ( ww2 ) vets

3) No return policies

4) Any money proved to have been earnt in our countries taken away and used to aid our homeless or ill

5) any funds to their countries/families STOPPED"
,katamail,2006-02-12T12:29Z,"They come to our country as refugees saying that their lives are in danger so OUR own SO CALLED GOVERNMENT give them a nice welcome pack of

1) A House
2) State Welfare
3) Job
4) Whatever They Want (otherwise it is RACIAL DISCRIMINATION)

We have our own worries and people to look after never mind taking on the worlds problems, they breed like bloody rabbits have more than their fair share of property and cars, they have taken over most of our major cities and call themselves the ETHNIC MINORITY i think we all know who is the real minority in this country dont we."

,Pirate 32,2006-07-04T10:55Z,"apparently, igl, these people have read FAR MORE about (atleast) islam than you.  So hav i, and i have extensive knowledge of the bible as well(including the unfavorable parts)."
,Pirate 32,2006-07-04T10:55Z,"In my educated opinion i would say that whenever the jews attacked someone in the old testamen it was justified.  IE: an enemy nation relentlesly stealing/raping jewish women or over sacrificing childred to molech.

In islam a jewish journalist warning people of the insanity, murders, and piracy comitted by old mo, and gabriel telling mo that the jews were going to drop a rock on his head, was justification for slaughtering 900 innocent jewish men and boys and raping/selling their women into slavery.

There is a BIG, YAWNING GAP between judaism/christianity and islam."

,Grassic,2011-12-06T00:29Z,"@POPE JOHN PAUL 2 - 'your god' did not create those inventions! Smarter men than you put in far more time and effort into their inventions than you have about anything. Well maybe apart from the effort you put into your own self fulfilling prophecy. This isn't a pissing contest between the west and the east because it's safe to say we're as bad at each other. The problem is everyone of you cunts think that you are right and there is no room for negotiation.

@may71 - If islamic countries stopped selling their oil to the west then the U.S, mostly, would create instability in the people and mass large number of rebels from these countries and have them kill their own leaders, finally replacing them with puppet presidents of America's choosing, which ofcouse would be thinly veiled behind the illusion of 'freedom' and 'democracy'. Thus solving the problem of oil changing hands without an invasion which would be highly criticised world-wide.

(note the nods towards the occupation of Iraq and the rebelion in Libia which claimed Gaddafi's life).

I know you people commented years ago and you will probably never read this, but I'm writing this out of complete contempt for the lot of you. How can everyone on both sides be so fucking single-minded? what the fuck is wrong with everyone that they can't comprehend things beyond their backyard?"
