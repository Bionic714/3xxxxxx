,bardolph,2007-02-18T12:20Z,"This version (Anton Lesser, reader) is HEAVILY ABRIDGED. In other words, there are huge parts of the story missing."
,bardolph,2007-02-18T12:30Z,"I should add, there is also an UNABRIDGED version of the Iliad read by Anton Lesser -- go to www.naxosaudiobooks.com and do a search (at the time of this comment, you can find it at 
http://www.naxosaudiobooks.com/PAGES/42812.htm )
The UNABRIDGED version is 13 CDs, so I don't think this 135MB torrent could possibly be anything but the ABRIDGED version, which is only 3 CDs."
