,Consider-Phlebas,2006-02-06T20:44Z,The only other rip I've seen floating around was apparently not as good as the UMD one.
,hairyfriend,2006-02-06T22:51Z,why doesn't work this one for me? different codec?
,Consider-Phlebas,2006-02-07T22:28Z,Tried VLC? www.videolan.org. Best and free...
,SmilySmile,2006-02-08T17:18Z,isnt this s1e15 ? at the start of this episode they show something that didnt happen in s2.. Feedback please!
,SmilySmile,2006-02-08T17:33Z,"oki, have now found out that is s2, but i am still lost about the beginning.."
,chris_18888,2006-02-08T18:32Z,"SmilySmile, this is season 2.  They just recap from season one, because the story continues with plot from season 1.  Look at the nice new vipers... ;)"
,temagami,2006-02-11T08:17Z,"there's also a mini-series leading up to the events of season 1.  If you don't want to dl that, the gist is that robots destroy humanity, and chase the last vestiges into space and start light speed jumping from place to place. (4hrs summed up)."
,MengDK1,2007-04-23T16:15Z,Plz seed! Desperatly need s2e15! Thx! :D I will continue to seed this one since it's so hard to get!
