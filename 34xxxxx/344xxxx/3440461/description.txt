Breach The Peace, Break The Barriers, Make Some Facking Noise!

Spiral Tribe - Breach The Peace - 1992

This piece of vinyl has had a few knocks - ripped from Technics 1210
to Numark mixer, straight to Sharp MiniDisc via master out, tracks
playing at 33 and a third rpm. Digital Processing done with
Polderbits' Sound Recorder and Editor (minor crackle removal and
a little adjustment on EQ).

IMO this is Spiral's best release, and sums up how bad the CJA
was for rave culture. More breakbeat and better paced than
the later releases, this has does have liberal use of 'bad'
language in the first two tracks ;)

Seed and Enjoy!
