This is the unreleased soundtrack to the classic 80's teen comedy Real Genius (except for one song, "The Tuff Do What?" by Tonio K. that has never been released anywhere) It features some more well known songs by the likes of Don Henley, Bryan Adams, and Tears For Fears, but also has some lost classics by The Comsat Angels, Chas Jenkel, The System, etc. It is a real time capsule of 80's synth pop and much coveted by collectors. I cobbled it together from a variety of websites and file sharing locations. If anyone has a lead on the lost track by Antonio K., I'd love to hear!
