,muppet_girl,2006-05-03T08:37Z,"Episode 1, 2 and 9 didn't come out right. They are plain dokuments (.rmvb) only and not video files. =("
,konkelberry,2006-07-24T21:47Z,"Hey. episode 1,2 and 9 aren't videofiles."
,say1988,2006-09-25T20:53Z,"1, 2, and 9 will play in realplayer.

2 and 9 are the same as 3 and 10. The two formats use seperate numbering system.

The realplayer ones count the 2 hour pilot as 1 episode. The other files count the pilot as two Episodes. This results in a missing episode. Based on the numbering system used by the majority of the files it would be episode 9.

Therefore don't download Episode 2 or 9 in this torrent. Find the correct episode 9 ""Listen up"" in elsewhere."

,Kristallskarva,2009-03-01T13:20Z,Some episodes are in .RMVB format. They are suppose to play in real player but they behave strangely. Too bad.
