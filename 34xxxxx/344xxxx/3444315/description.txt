This is The L Word Season 1 with all episodes #1 through to 14.

The L word follows the lives and loves of a small, close-knit group of lesbians living in Los Angeles as well as the friends and family members that either support or loath them.

The quality of all the episodes is good but don't be expecting any HDTV quality episodes.
