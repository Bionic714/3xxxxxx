-= GAME INFOS =-

SX On Tour allows players to create their own boarder
or skier and take them from a wannabe to a mountain rockstar.
Players can get noticed in all-new shred challenges where they
earn an invitation to The Tour where they'll face the best racers
in the SSX cast. Fly down the all-new tracks, and master the
new monster tricks for both boarding and skiing to make it to
the top of The Charts.
