,krutan,2006-02-10T16:26Z,It this the game where you can't turn?
,JacKaLen,2006-02-10T17:36Z,"What do you mean ""can't turn"".. I have not had any  problems playing the game.
I have finished it already. "
,kevinf5,2006-02-10T18:52Z,"If this game just got uploaded today, why are there no seeders?  Come on and see you bunch of douche bags!"
,krutan,2006-02-10T23:24Z,"Last time I downloaded a rip of Manhunt I couldn't turn, and I know lots of people had that problem."
,krutan,2006-02-11T20:53Z,Same crap as before
,krutan,2006-02-11T21:33Z,Seems like if you have a joystick or something you have to disconnect it to look around :(
,JacKaLen,2006-02-12T01:15Z,I haven't tried using a joystick.. But just using a keyboard and mouse there'll be no problems. At least not what I know of. :)
,trickykid,2006-02-18T20:04Z,When I click the manhunt.exe file... nothing happens.... I don't even have a man not to turn!
,JacKaLen,2006-02-19T16:07Z,And you have extracted the batch-file..?
,kendorobban,2006-02-23T18:54Z,when i extracted the _unpack file and pressed a button on the keyboard as it told me to do it just closed down
,JacKaLen,2006-02-25T00:44Z,"Well, it's packed through winrar, and with a batch-file. The batch-file compresses many MB to nearly nothing.
To be honest I don't exactly know how it is working I downloaded this game from LimeWire. "
,JacKaLen,2006-02-25T00:56Z,"You can read about batch files here:

Well, as I wrote in the description you'll have to unpack the batch-file and files begin extracting through DOS. 
And there you go.. Ready to play."

,tehtechman,2007-02-16T20:33Z,a 190MB file will yield a 1.3GB install.  I don't believe this shit.  Can anyone confirm or deny the validity of this torrent?
,Viliar,2007-05-16T10:33Z,"Hey, pals! Please, seed this! Many people really need this thing)"
,sandasandasanda,2007-07-07T13:37Z,"I don't know what you all pessimists are talking about but my game worked fine. First I unrared the rar-file, then I went through the weird naked japanese-Install and in the folder I installed it there was a Bat-file, or whatever it's name is, called ""_Unpak"". That took about 2-3 minutes and then I just pressed the manhunt icon. Everything's working fine and the game is pretty psycho. No virus what I can see :D"
,sandasandasanda,2007-07-07T13:41Z,Fagge batch-filen ligger i C:\Program\ManHunt. Där finns det en fil som heter _Unpak. Du har väl gått igenom den där nakna japan installationen eller? Den finns i rar-filen som du extraherar först av allt.
,pzychorabbit,2007-07-19T15:52Z,plz seed
,Sui_Juris,2007-09-08T18:14Z,This is the full game but it's a RIP version and not a demo..Works just fine...

,H3llSp4wn,2007-11-11T15:15Z,"Uhm, well i installed it but when i open the manhunt program it says ""Manhunt.exe doesnt work""

What to do now? "
,H3llSp4wn,2007-11-12T21:16Z,"I'd found out. 

THIS GAME DOES >NOT< WORK WITH WINDOWS VISTA!


- To install this game, you have to extract the downloaded WinRar map called ManHunt, and after that you open the Program with a naked thai-bitch . You press the button on the top, creating the map in default /:C-Computer-Programs-Manhunt. 
in this map there is a .bat file called _Unpak, let it extract the files, and you are ready to nuke some faggots.

,FieroGT42,2007-12-01T00:58Z,"::: FAQ :::

Q: 190MB?  Must be a demo, virus, etc!!!!
A: Hello, ""n00b"".  No, it's called properly utilizing available compression technology, being considerate, and just plain doing things the right way.  It USED to be the standard before everybody and their grandma starting uploading uncompressed disc images.

Q: It's downloading slowly but my connection is ""teh moast uber evar"".
A: It's BitTorrent.  Learn to set it up properly, configure TCP/IP routing, and you may as well optimize your connection.  DSLReports is a good place to start.

Q: It won't unzip/install!
A: Learn to use archiving software and follow the  decompression instructions.

Q: Won't run on Vista...
A: Why the hell do you even have Vista?  You're such a tool.  Go build your own computer and pirate a copy of XP x64 Pro Corp VLK while you're at it.  FYI, Vista has been known to drop FPS by as much as 50% in some games on the same hardware setup."
,b0dyrem0ver,2007-12-12T06:26Z,"You missed one, Fiero...

Q) How do I uninstall this game, even though it didn't install the way normal programs do?
A) Simple. Go to a DOS prompt and type in ""FORMAT C:"" you fecking n00b. If it didn't install then it runs straight out of the folder you unzipped it to. If that's the case, you just have to delete the damn folder! Christ almighty, how on earth did some of you work out how to switch a PC on???"
,joshp123,2007-12-17T23:50Z,"For people saying it doesn't work, you're doing something wrong....

Read the FAQ above and you'll have no problems...

Thanks a lot, great upload ;)"
,Andyjr,2008-01-19T13:49Z,"What's with the naked jap girl? That really confused me for a minute, I was following the instruction.  Bizarre way to install!"

,kuttylover,2008-02-01T14:28Z,"i dosnt work here:\

,domientius,2008-04-20T13:10Z,I wonder if FieroGT42 and b0dyrem0ver were butt fucking each other when they wrote their little shitty tirades? Both of you can fuck off.
,PawnSacrifice,2008-04-23T14:30Z,"The irony is, this torrent is getting speeds of about 10kb/s.

The 1.58 Gig torrent is getting speeds of 100kb/s.

So even though its bigger its a lot faster to download! 

Obviously I know how to configure my download software hence I can get 100kb/s. 

The n00b kids who don't seed should be banned. "
