?

I don?t think you CAN change the language with what we?ve been given. If you look at HD/Users/""username""/Library/Application Support/Macromedia/Flash MX 2004/ there is only ?de? listed.

Which is a real shame, because this is the only version of 2004 I could find.

At 602Mb, not worth downloading unless you speak Dutch!

,redre327,2007-12-09T07:17Z,"ok.... there has to be a way to add english translation, just by add a certian  .file within the application support folder. Come on hackers! Use your head, come up with something. Is is that easy though?"
,snoopfroggyfrog,2009-01-04T17:27Z,"This is NOT dutch!!! It is the full GERMAN version of Studio MX 2004. Btw the last version of freehand available. After the takeover of the software suite by adobe in 2005 freehand was canceled for the benefit of illustrator.

Fully compatible with leopard, runs on both ppc- and intel-macs. On opening the disk image mounter shows an error message. Simply ignore this. Seems the dmg was created with an older version (maybe panther). There are ways to repair this, but its not necessary.

Thanks for this great upload!"
