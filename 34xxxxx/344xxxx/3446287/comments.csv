,Sleepburn,2006-03-08T21:03Z,It is? I have Panda Antivirus and it did not report any trojan in it. :(
,SDude,2006-03-16T18:24Z,"Nah it's just your AV
Well i have Norton Corporate edition 10v.
And it says everything is ok.

,EAB,2006-07-24T00:06Z,"yeah, I'm having the same problems as herbman

but besides that it works perfectly."
,EAB,2006-07-24T19:33Z,"I just found a solution to it the problem:


go here:
http://duke3d.m-klein.com/

scroll down and download version 19.7.1. When you're done with that, put all the files into your DUKE NUKEM 3D ATOMIC folder. Let them overwrite any files in that folder (don't worry, your controls won't get fu*ked up). Let them replace any file in there and all should be well."
