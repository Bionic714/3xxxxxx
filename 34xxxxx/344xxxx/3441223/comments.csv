,Panodilo,2006-02-07T22:25Z,Anyone else get a disk read error on unpacking?
,dre8,2006-02-19T18:37Z,"Yes, me too! 
Previous TiAMO-CSI files worked well... Thanx, by the way :oP!
Problems with unpacking occured from episode 13 on, that is for all series Miami, Las Vegas and NY (files posted by TiAMO only). 

Any suggestions?
