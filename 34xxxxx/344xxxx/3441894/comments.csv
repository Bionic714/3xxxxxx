,Salustius,2007-04-22T20:45Z,"I can find no software that palys these files except VLC. It seems that VLC annot convert a group of files to Burn an Audio CD. 

Can someone, make a suggestion on how to convert this to Wave.  Sugestions to converto to Mp3, please abstain."
,oldiesguy8898,2007-08-27T20:55Z,"Just download the FLAC interface (do a google search) and decompress the files to .wav. You can burn these to a CD with Real Audio or WMP

This is THE version of this album. It sounds like you're in the room with Joni. If you ever see a CD with Steve Hoffman's name on it, buy it. It will be the definitive version."
