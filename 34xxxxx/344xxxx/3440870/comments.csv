,WPadde,2006-02-25T15:36Z,"Its real simple to fix this cdkey problem.

1. You just open ""Start MenuProgramsAccessoriesSystem Tools"" and then ""System Restore"".
2. Then you restore your computer like it was before 24/2 ""witch is my lucky birthday, damn symantec :P"".
3. Be sure that your not connected to internet when you boot your computer.
4. Disable Liveupdate and then DONT UPDATE NORTON ANTIVIRUS. Just the dat files...

Enjoy."
,Crash613,2006-02-25T22:44Z,"you have posted that ""solution"" in at least 2 threads..  it does not work for everyone.  i tried to system restore.  followed directions but still doesn't work"
,jabbaru,2006-02-26T01:35Z,"Only solution i have found that works for me ( WORKS FOR ME ) it to uninstall the shit, after i went back with the system restore to the 20th Feb, then install again, once installed as the crack text says i disabled the live update, i could however update the dat files as WPadde  said.."
,jabbaru,2006-02-26T11:05Z,"Systemworks is working, all the utilities are working and Internet security is also working.. go back with the system restor several days uninstall it and then install it again, you should still have the same amount of days left on the license and no need to telephone activate either, just make sure you stop the live updates on the AV."
,peterpeterthepussyeater,2006-02-26T13:48Z,i tryed the systemrestore but somehow i have no days availeble before 24-02 anyone know if i have to uninstall and then systemrestore will work?? thanks

I'm not al that sure, but in previous years, you had to ensure your PC was disconnected from the internet (as in physically plugged out), before you do the telephone thing. Maybe different this year, but its worth a try."
,sycopath1916,2006-03-11T00:39Z,"Oh, and

YOU DON'T F**KING RING THE F**KING NUMBER.

Yeah. In past years, you'd use keygen, not the phone."
,adthrawn,2006-04-12T15:18Z,how can you just update the dat files?
,De_Varzha,2006-07-01T08:32Z,"How do i crack this? :S I have installed it, done the phone registration, the after a little while it asks me to do it again. Then the cracked phone registration doesnt work, and both Norton Internet Security and System Works are unactivated. Help!"
