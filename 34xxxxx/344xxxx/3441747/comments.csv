smells fishy to me."

,therrylor,2008-11-07T07:05Z,"it's amazing and works fine, just ignore the trojan signal your antivirus warns you about. To all of those who don't get a valid code from the keygen, i used ""kiba kubaner"" as KIBA was so nice to share with us on her comment. Thank you to the uploader and Kiba!"
,therrylor,2008-11-07T07:06Z,"oh sorry the uploader is KIBA!!!

Thanks 2wice then!!"
