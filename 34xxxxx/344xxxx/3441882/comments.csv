happen to have ""The Corner"", could some of you please upload it here on the bay?

And for you, who don't know ""The Corner"":

It's some kind of prequel to The Wire and an Emmy winner of course and made by HBO, David Simon and the gang."
,chronjohnson,2006-02-09T00:32Z,I have been looking for The Corner forever.  I also require a high quality PDF of The Wire book.
,jc75,2006-10-05T23:05Z,"any chance we could get subtitles for ""the Corner"" as well?"
,marloncortez,2007-02-09T04:23Z,"I love ""The Wire"". Have season 1 & 2 on DVD but i couldn't find season 3 so i downloaded it.
Never seen ""The Corner"" but will look for it.

If anyone knows of any place i could find the norwegian subtitles for the wire, please let me know.

,Simon82,2007-05-20T10:29Z,Thanks a lot. I go nuts looking for subs s2. I wish more people take the time to upload small but important stuff like subs to PB.

,arson451,2008-01-20T23:09Z,If you like the Wire and the Corner you should really check out Homicide: Life on the Streets. Its by David Simon also and precludes the Wire and the Corner. And of course it takes place in Baltimore
