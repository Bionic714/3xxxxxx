,MietmaN,2006-03-15T20:27Z,"It's a very good martial arts film - no special effects (almost ;)), just pure kung fu and human skills, what we lack today. 
Seeding at up to 120KB/s, but I can't do this for ages ... so hurry up ;)"
,MietmaN,2006-03-20T19:42Z,"I've already uploaded almost 5GB - hope the rest will carry on!
Jet Li really does look young in this movie, but I didn't know he was only 19 at the time :P"
,jmalmsten,2006-04-14T19:47Z,"för mig är det helt klart engelskt tal, och ja jag kan höra skillnad på kinesiskt/japanskt/engelskt/finskt tal eller nåe annat språk oftast... 

for me it's clearly dubbed... or is it dual-language? if it is, neither VLC or MPC recognizes the second track..."
,jmalmsten,2006-04-14T19:49Z,"also, as stated, there were no wirefu in this movie, and it was his 1st movie..."
