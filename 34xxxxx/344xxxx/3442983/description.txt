KEN MARTIN - Synthesizers, Guitar, Programming and Production. 

Ken's music transports and recalls my mind to the same vein it used to be in when I would sit in front of my stereo and listen to the New Age synthesizer music of the 1970's in my bedroom. It is fantanstic to discover a new storehouse of musical material delivering that familiar 'Berlin School' (New Age Spacemusic) sound. The UK has consistently been a haven for excellent, cutting edge musical artists and Ken Martin is right in there, shining like a musical gold piece.
