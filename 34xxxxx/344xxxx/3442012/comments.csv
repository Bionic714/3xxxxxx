,Gavvi,2007-04-12T06:57Z,Why not many single 320kb album torrents? Thanx
,Gavvi,2007-04-15T03:33Z,"I finally got it downloaded only to find over half of it is JUNK. Why MP3-320 if you can't even remove record scratch? or remember to ground your turntable? And that's just a review of the albums in 320. 

Obiwan - why do you bother and waste my time with crap?  At least separate the crap from the good CDs before you put it all in one big down load. 

I have lots of vinyl sourced music, but at least I have the curtesy to remove the scratches and otherwise do a righteous job at digitizing."

,FatFreddy247,2008-04-13T13:25Z,perfect torrent with all the studio albums at 320kbps!
,Judensau,2008-08-14T05:07Z,"This is absolutely awful.  The first album is decent, with some scratching but nothing too bad.  Everything after it it total crap, with the audio cutting out frequently.  The third song I tried, Blinded By Science, was missing the left audio half of the time.  Most of this is unbearably bad, and it's not worth trying to find the tracks that are actually passable."
