,PenPusher,2006-02-09T04:13Z,Mine was badly out-of-sync. Don't know if it's the file or the result of a corrupted download. For me it was 'bout 2 700ms the first 14 mins or so and 'bout 5 650ms for the rest.

,killabozz,2006-02-25T23:32Z,"If you are out of sync:

Download Media Player classic and tell the audio switcher to timeshift the audio by 3000ms it syncs up perfectly... after about 2/3's change it to 6000ms."
