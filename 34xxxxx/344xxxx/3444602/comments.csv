,MillStrike,2006-02-14T23:44Z,"U seem to be missing some episodes, there is 61 in total today (14/02)"
,weezl,2006-02-15T00:17Z,"like i said: ""I have skipped the ""best of.."" -compilations"" which are best animal, electrical and explosive myths. That leaves 1. A good idea for you would be to first find out which ones are missing and then post it here. It's always easy to complain..."
,Capt.Snowman,2006-02-15T04:27Z,"Don't write ""ALL eps"" if you don't have all the episodes."

,weezl,2006-03-10T22:10Z,"If you like MythBusters then you'll most likely like Brainiac, dl here:
