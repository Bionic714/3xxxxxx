Here you go, ALL myhthbusters episodes to date (2006-02-14) in good quality.
Most of the episodes are released by 'digitaldistractions' except the first pilot (don't know from who) and 3x08-10 which are from 'fqm'.
Also I have skipped the "best of.." -compilations.


The titles and ep-# are from the MythBusters homepage.
As are the beginning eps of S01-02, s03 beginning ep is taken from www.tv.com 
Titles to some of the specials are from the episodes themselves.


I don't want messeges concerning subs, there aren't any in this torrent and I DON'T know where to get them, so just learn english!
Don't msg me about "i can't play the files...", download VLC! (www.videolan.org)
Seed atleast 1:1

and btw, I won't be uploading that fast cos of bandwidth issues, so be patient (and don't msg me about seeding if your dl averages around 20 KB/s).

if you have any OTHER questions you are welcome to msg me @TPB :)



sidenote:
At the Discovery shop the episodes are sold for around $20 a pop!
And the season collections (which do not contain all episodes from that season) cost $50-s01 & $100-s02!
I think that THOSE prices are stealing.
No wonder piracy is so widespread.
