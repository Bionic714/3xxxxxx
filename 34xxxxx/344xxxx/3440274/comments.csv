,swy000,2006-02-05T08:44Z,"Bzerker: sorry, there are no swedish subs... 
Another note: i will put up the second part once a substantial part of this has been gone around..."
,UnchosenOne,2006-02-05T10:09Z,"OMG! This is something, really.
I'll, however, download 1st season first and burn, to see if it works for me... "
,donedo,2006-02-05T10:29Z,Ooh man I have to clean my harddrive tonight to get some free space
,MortenCB,2006-02-05T12:50Z,"Thanks a bunch for this. 

Please wait with part 2 until we have managed to get this one (and possibly make room for another ~40GB :) )."
,swy000,2006-02-05T13:40Z,"UnchosenOne: good idea... give it a shot :) come back if you like what ive done..personal editing and it took me a hell of alot to try and fit all episode into one DL DVD.but i tried to maintain quality!

donedo: you do that :P

MortenCB: np.. you got my word.. i will make sure this is available to you and everyone else;part 2 as well..sorry about my personal upload speed though... good thing is i never turn of my comp...

i will follow up my seed... trust me ;)

swy000"
,speedcop,2006-02-05T20:09Z,"Oh dudes, it will probably take three months to get this fantastic package with the meager upload speeds you leechers are giving..  :----(

If all 40 leechers are uploading almost nothing, then *all* 40 leechers will need to get *all* the data from the one single seeder, and it will take 40 times as long for every one to get the whole package! Be smart guys: the more you upload, the faster you will get everything home!!!"
,swy000,2006-02-05T23:56Z,"speedcop: i am the one with the capped upload although im the one offering this. my max upload is 30k and min is 20k. It took my 1 day to upload 1.63GB, so it will be 23 days before i get a full upload! The good part is however, everyone will get the WHOLE piece at the same time cause the percentages are too close.. everyone is increasing at the same time... sorry about that.."
,darkace,2006-02-06T08:33Z,"All hail to swy000!
I will get a lot of bouns points at home delivering this to my girlfriend (sorry I can't let you in on those though)"
,swy000,2006-02-07T08:35Z,"speedcop: swtiched over to superseed now, however, for the ""Share Ratio"" option, should it be 1:1 or 1:2(0.5)  ???? and why?"
,swy000,2006-02-07T09:02Z,good news: upload now has increased to 34K... :D but only for about 14 hours a day...then back down to 25 :(..
,MortenCB,2006-02-11T15:27Z,"I hope you didn't leave us.  There are currently no seeders, and I am very happy if I can get all of this :)"
,swy000,2006-02-12T11:38Z,"speedcop: thank you for the clarification speedcop. 
Got some more good news for everyone: I will be double-seeding this every once in a while! How?
Im gonna be taking season 1-5 on laptop to my Univ where upload is HIGH!! i will try to do this as often as possible. I am putting the data on the laptop as i type and azureus as well :)....
hope this helps... :)
PS: hpy bday gurL ;)"
,swy000,2006-02-14T01:54Z,"ok, the only speed im getting in unviersity is 9K or less.. however if i upload on HTTP, i get aroubd 160K per sec... i have no idea why..... "
,swy000,2006-02-14T02:26Z,ok i tried again...but this time with microtorrent..i hit 100K per sec a few times.. i was a huge fan of azureus but microtorrent gave better results...sorry azureus!
,Grake,2006-02-17T20:05Z,"Registered here just to write my comments for this upload :D

Thanks a lot for this upload man. Very much appereciate it."
,swy000,2006-02-18T06:22Z,"Grake: your more than welcome.. stay tuned for the second part... im hoping that when people finish this, they will seed it for others, so i can put up seasons 6-10... enjoy!!"
,Totoro,2006-02-18T12:08Z,Thanx!!!!!
,Mikkeline,2006-02-18T17:03Z,Okay - this is a huge torrent but I just finished the First Season 1 DVD and I regreat to say that the quality is not good. For those of you who do not care about that it is a bargain of course... Maybe someone could put up a sample ??
,swy000,2006-02-19T11:11Z,"Mikkeline: i fit 24 episodes into 1 dvd, and i said in the note that it has been a bit depreciated... its really not that bad (well i guess thats what i thought)..., i watched it on ~30inch at home and it looks fine :s.. but i guess its what i thought... everyone should test the first season in case they dont like it i guess..... thnx for the feedback mikkeline..."
,sarusani,2006-02-21T21:07Z,I'm with swy000. The Quality is not excelent but it's good enough. It's a TV Serie and not a HQ blockbuster movie! :-)
,Mikkeline,2006-02-22T14:26Z,swy000 : You are right of course and you have done a hell of a job !!! It's just that I have half of the seasons as DVDr with subs as put up here on PirateBay before.... Guess I'm just  spoiled  but I would really like that someone put up the rest of the series as DVDr also.... Keep up this good torent though - I'm downloading it as well and it is fully watchable.
,JoeMaya,2006-02-27T08:54Z,"Hey Swy000!!! AWESOME JOB!!! I finished season 2 and tried it out, it's wonderful. Am downloading the rest of the seasons now. Can't wait to get part 2. I hope it's soon. Let us know when you plan to upload it. Thanks a million for this awesome upload. My Family's gonna be thrilled to watch this today."
,swy000,2006-03-02T06:08Z,"kawasakikr1: ur welcome.. :) i will keep uploading this till its done. The cool thing is, once 1 person is done, we are gonna have about 30 seeds or so cause everyone is at the same level!!!  Glad the quality is kool! i thought it was as well!!

JoeMaya: np buddy!  I will put up part 2 as soon as this is done. It on hold! Just waiting for that 100% as soon as someone gets it ;)"

,TheWapMan,2006-03-15T13:39Z,"Under 400 MB left.. 99,0%.. looking good... I Really want to throw all the bad ql avi-files on my computer in the trashcan.. but i have to see the ql first.. well back to the books.. once again thanx.. "
,swy000,2006-03-15T19:10Z,"TheWapMan: dont expect AMAZING quality... the quality is good enough for tv.. i wouldve advised you to check season 1 before you downloaded the whole thing...
its nice having a single season on ONE DVD (Double Layer ofcourse)! and thats what I opted for... let me know what u think however.... 99.9% alot of people on my list!"
,TheWapMan,2006-03-15T23:26Z,"Okey.. that´s true.. not great quality.. but´s okey.. but nice to have all episodes on only 10 DL instead of 60 different DVDs.. 

Many thx!! looking forward to 6-10.. ;)

I´ll seed this one for some time now if you want to download the next.. :)"
,TheWapMan,2006-03-15T23:29Z,upload... ;)
,TheWapMan,2006-03-15T23:34Z,"Hmm some soundproblems when I checked through it (just 1 ep on 1 and 1 on 5) the sound was not synched in season 5.. :(
just my cpu or more that have the problem?"
,swy000,2006-03-16T01:15Z,"thats odd! gimme the season and episode number plz....
it should be fine!"
,swy000,2006-03-16T01:38Z,"do u mean 1 episode one season 1 is not completely synched and 1 episode on season 5 is not synched????

if yes, plz tell me the episode numbers.... thnx!"
,TheWapMan,2006-03-16T09:38Z,Season 5 ep 1-3 when I look through it a bit hasty now.. I will take some more time with it later and look through them all.. 
,swy000,2006-03-16T14:07Z,"TheWapMan: hey man, i tested all the episodes on Nero Showtime, Windows Media Player, and WinDVD Gold Edition. They are all perfect synch! I also tried it on my dvd player (an LG), and it works perfect their as well.

Try them elsewhere, it must me your CPU or some other thing...

I was a bit surprised, cause the only error i made in all 10 season was in 1 episode in Season 8, and i couldnt correct it. Other than that, most of it is flawless.

Let me know if you have other concerns."
,Totoro,2006-03-18T11:32Z,"I think that this episode is missing from the first season:
1.12 The One With the Dozen Lasagnas "

,ranis,2006-03-21T10:54Z,"This may sound newb, but, what's this? I downloaded it, but I can't watch it. Is this only for burning? In that case, that's cool, and I will do so.. Can anyone walk me through how to do so? Detailed please :P

ANyway, very good job, your'e the MAN. Where can I find 6 - 10?

,erazem,2006-03-21T22:27Z,"swy000: Hello!

I am willing to start receiving the second part - but my upload is only 33 - 30 Kb/s.
Anyway, I can start with that in like 24 hours. 
Let me know...
so far I have uploaded over 60 Gb of part 1."
,swy000,2006-03-22T01:26Z,"erazem: i would have wanted someone with a higher upload, but so far your the only one who got back to me, so we can going that... my upload is as much as yours, so im no better.

,switchenobos,2006-04-02T19:45Z,"How is things coming on part two? Is there any progress? When can I expect it to be ready for download?
Really enjoying this upload! Thanks alot!! :D"
,ranis,2006-04-06T17:26Z,"Is ""alkohol"" like a media player or what? Can you watch the episodes with any computer or do you need a burner? I am currently sitting on a very old comp."
,swy000,2006-04-07T02:18Z,"ranis: no alkohol is an image loader. It allows you to create virtual drives (like a CD or a DVD drive) on which you can put these images in order to watch them. Google around for alkohol and download the program. Ask later if you have more questions. There are other programs out there, i only use this one though."
,ranis,2006-04-07T08:15Z,"swy000 THANK you! :D I have downloaded alkohol and made it work :)

One question though. There seems to be something wrong with Season 2. I get to ""select episode"", but when I choose one, VLC fails to load it :S All other seasons works kind of o.k, but season 2 refuses to open any episode. :/

What's the problem? Why doesn't all seasons work the same?

Again, thank you :)"
,swy000,2006-04-07T08:56Z,"ranis: they should all be working..ive asked many people who downloaded it and all seasons are working perfectly. I only have 1 epsiode missing from season 1. Other than that, they should be ok. try it on another computer and see if it does the same thing....."
,aXeL718NYC,2006-04-23T22:46Z,IT ALL WORKS! THX SWY000

,Drazzii,2006-07-24T20:01Z,Is this worth downloading? I mean are there still many seeds and is it a fast torrent?
,oink777,2006-08-18T17:53Z,Is anyone else experiencing a lagging of the sound in season 4? Is this just the first few episodes or is it the whole season?
,swy000,2006-09-29T05:58Z,"wow, i cant believe this is still here..at one point i thought it was removed... any updates? seeding ok? this is huge i know.maybe i should re-join the seeding process for you guys.... hmmmm"
,ranis,2006-10-03T21:20Z,"How do you burn these to DVD?

Thank you."
,frikie,2006-10-10T13:42Z,"ouch, this is gonna take a while to download. But it shure is worth waiting. 
I do hope that i will get it all. A reseed from Swy000 wouldn´t be a bad christmas present:)
And a big THANX to both the current seeders and most of all swy000 for making this torrent!!"
,Dutcher99,2006-10-13T16:38Z,"Hi all,
