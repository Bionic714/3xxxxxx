Summary:

"When teenager Wilby Daniels became a part-time canine in THE SHAGGY DOG, he didn't realize that this condition would come back and "hound" him again in his adult years. In this side-splitting sequel, Wilby's all grown up now, with a wife and son. Unfortunately, he's still subject to a furry transformation every time the inscription on an ancient scarab ring is read aloud ... not a comforting prospect when you've bounded into the public eye as a candidate for District Attorney!"
