This playlist serves for several different reasons.

1: DJing: Being a amatuer DJ myself, a lot of the songs in here are pretty good party songs that you can spin for people to enjoy.

2: Gettin' it on ^_^: Some of the songs in here are off the Sex List playlist from Real Rhapsody.  So, they can serve as a soundtrack to get it on to.

3: Humor: I got a lot of comedy on this list, too.  Most of it has made me laugh, but yet again... my sense of humor is really good so anything makes me laugh...

4: Just plain collecting: There's like 500 songs in this list.  So, if you're just a collector like I am, it can boost your media library a good bit.
