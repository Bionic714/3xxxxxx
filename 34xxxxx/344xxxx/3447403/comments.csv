,banjohero,2012-08-05T05:14Z,"Good audio quality.  Track titles on disc 1 are screwed up, but, whatever. :)

Track one is mislabelled as a hidden track; according to wikipedia the actual hidden track is pre-gap, apparently, so probably just didn't rip, or something.
So, all the tunes' files are named for the preceding song.  ""Bill Mon"" on this is actually ""Ballad of Jed Clampett,"" etc.

Track 9 has like five minutes of dead air after the tune, but I assume that's how the actual CD was.

Track 10 is the second hidden track.  There's also one at the end of disc 3, but that seems to have been labelled right.


But, it all sounds good, and that's what's really important, isn't it?"
