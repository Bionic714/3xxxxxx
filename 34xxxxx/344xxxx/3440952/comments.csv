,Brado,2006-03-01T09:03Z,"Ok, I'm normally pretty good at finding anything, but subs for this are proving difficult (what does it really matter, its more nostalgic to watch a 'kung fu' movie without really knowing whats being said anyway!)...  If anyone has any better luck than me however, please post a link.  Thanks for the upload Izudin, maybe ill take up chinese in my spare pirating time... but thanks for real mate"
,Brado,2006-03-02T10:06Z,"Well, I found some subtitles, but unfortunately they appear to be of similar quality (or the same translation) of what Sonjz was talking about... very cryptic, very babel fish.  The sync is also off and u may need to rename to srt file for it to even work per disc.  IMO dont bother unless u just want to know the finer details of this fine movie (opening srt in notepad).  Once again, thanks for the upload."
