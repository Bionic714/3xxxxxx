,architete,2008-08-07T16:27Z,"on os 10.5.2 and .3 

it produces a massive error where the hol page/work plane goes full of markings/arrows 
if you close it and reopen several times it goes away, but it makes the app usseless really

the key provided above works

i am not seeding this as it doesn't work

,antimatterserpent,2009-08-08T09:55Z,"Note: VW 11 does NOT work with Leopard (OS 10.5), it only works with up to 10.4.11 (Tiger).  I know this for a fact because my boss was forced to upgrade to VW 2009 in order for us to work on our new Macs, which cannot run Tiger."
,luminary07,2010-11-26T23:55Z,"Actually Vectorworks 11 requires Mac OS 10.5 or higher (Leopard or Snow Leopard). 

Tech support has a post: Vectorworks 2011 will not run on OSX 10.4.11, you will need an Intel-based Mac with OSX 10.5 or 10.6.
