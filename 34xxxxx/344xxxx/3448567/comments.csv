,k-t-m,2006-02-24T02:02Z,"isn't this obsolete, now that the ""c&c 1st decade"" collection is out? or does that one only have the dos version?"
,Carobu,2006-02-24T13:01Z,I truly can't say the answer to this however I can assure you of this is an exact ISO of my Command&Conquer 95 disk from 11 years ago I think this might even be version 1.0 this included the DOS and Windows 95 version however my guide is only for the windows 95 part of it 
,pether,2006-02-24T15:36Z,"1st Decade includes ALL C&c Games.
They are ready to play on XP."
,Dead-Inside,2006-02-28T14:08Z,Concidering this is 1.1 GB I presume that the music CD is included?
,Carobu,2006-02-28T21:28Z,No it is not. It is an exact iso of both disks However I'm thinking of remaking or just by itself the Command&Conquer RED ALERT sound track I do not own the Command&Conquer 95 sound track sorry the 1.1 gb is just the size of the original game
,Plockgodis,2006-04-02T12:34Z,"I need some help, the part when i should type some words in run dont work for me, when i type it and press enter it shows a window whit the text ....failurel... bla bla bla.. can find the... and stuff like that :S whats wrong?"

,nuido,2006-08-23T14:08Z,When i start the game some kind of error appears and the game won't start. Does this happen to anybody else?
,nuido,2006-08-27T14:07Z,"Can someone plz upload ""

,nattblind,2007-04-08T18:26Z,how the f*ck is the original game 1.1gb? no way mate...
,<JesC>,2007-06-27T21:39Z,"Well, i presume that 1,1 gb comes from Daemon tools + C&C Original game (Videos n' musics)
Tho Daemon tools doesnt affect that much.
Anyone got this work with Vista?"
,anarchyohio,2007-12-11T03:07Z,"@k-t-m: I would agree that this upload is obsoleted by The First Decade, however, you need to download a DL-DVD for The First Decade.  Even compressed, a DL image is still 7.5 GiB, which happens to be more than 1.1 GiB as oddly as that works out, therefore requiring more time to download.

@lobopro: I know that the demo did have cheats, though I wasn't old enough to use the PC then, but the normal game does not, the only exception being the possibility of a trainer--and I have never happened to come across one."
,Carobu,2007-12-12T03:33Z,"for anyone still using this and having problems running it get the DLL from my first post and open the .nfo file in microsoft word, it should work if you follow everything."
[T],lieM-,2008-01-15T21:56Z,"It's 1.1 GiB because there are 2 cd's.
The GDI and NOD CD.

If you want to play the missions for GDI you have to insert the GDI CD so if i'm right, all the mission vid's are on the CD, that can explain the size of the files.

Same counts for NOD. "
