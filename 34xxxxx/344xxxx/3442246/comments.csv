If someone still needs the last 1 to 25% leave a comment or PM me and I will share what little bandwidth I have to let you comeplete your torrent.

,the_mcbain,2007-01-07T15:00Z,"Thanks for adding the last 0.01%.

But I cannot get it yet. I mean, I cannot get the 1 seeder in the Swarm - is that normal? I guess it will take a while until the leechers become a seeder and  I can get it, but I'm not that BT expert..."
