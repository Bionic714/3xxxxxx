[T],FaeGiN,2006-04-23T19:33Z,"Its great of you to offer such a big download butlike the guy above said...you should NEVER rar seperate episodes as,  ike me, some people might be just looking for one or two episodes and cannot find them anywhere, then they could download your torrent and just select only to download the files they are needing. s it is, a couple of episodes of this are impossible to find anywhere..episode 6 and 15. so i have no choice but to DL your whole rar file of gigabytes, open it and then dlete all the files but the two that i need.
You willl save yourself bandwidth if you heed this advice as people WILL download the whole file if they want to get an episode!
Oh erm, thanks :)"
