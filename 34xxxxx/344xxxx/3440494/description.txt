I know the quality of this one is really crappy and that the sound lags, etc. But it was converted from 25 different RealMedia-files and the original material is almost 40 years old and really not that good either.
But anyhow, this clip of Doug Engelbart doing a demo of the system that he'd invented is an essential piece of computer history. Here for the first time things like the mouse, cut'n'paste, e-mail, webcam-conferencing and other concepts that we today take for granted are presented for the very first time and this is looooong before companies like Apple and Microsoft laid claim to having invented the GUI, the mouse, etc.
So please, no wining about the quality, just try and enjoy it anyway ;-)
