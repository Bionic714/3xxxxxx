,tombug,2006-08-10T17:38Z,"hey can someone help me? i have just installed the game but i have problems.... 1, the Launch file brings up a invisible window with a visible outline, 2, the game wont start as it chrashs, 
can someone please help me? i really want to play this game"
,tombug,2006-08-12T01:08Z,:( i guess its my specs..... (they are high enough... just a little to much)
,infra001,2006-08-30T00:11Z,"I fixed the problem you mentioned above, you have to run the batch file that converts the textures, etc.. However still the game won't load, it's a lost cause it seems... 

When I finally managed to load it with all the files, it gives a D3D (directx) error, and there's no way to fix it..

Do not waste your time downloading this torrent, it will take forever... and it WILL NOT WORK.

IT WONT WORK!

kk thx"
,infra001,2006-08-30T20:49Z,"OK I managed to finally fix the D3D Error, this was a problem with the Graphic Driver, if it gives a D3D Error about 640x480, then you need to downgrade your graphic driver to something quite old, for me I downgraded to NVidia 78.01 driver.

So when you extract the archive, run the setup.bat in the root folder to work all the textures, etc. also the other reg bat file, then reinstall graphic drivers to something old (if required)."
,rautie,2007-01-11T23:17Z,"the problem is that this doesn't work in XP. unless anybody knows any hackers who can hack the exe file, the same as birth of the federation. thanx for putting this on though, couldn't find it anywhere else"
,darkdaz,2007-09-06T18:40Z,"hey i got a load corrpted files from this download, i recommend not do a sfx file, winrar it with recovery record that will better"
,CaveHermit,2008-05-16T21:07Z,Download MS Virtual PC 2007 .. It's got a 98/ME Emulator.. and you machine should be fastenough to do it. (The specs on this game are pretty low..)
