The Rhodium was a website for static, flat pages dealing with the synthesis of various psychoactive chemicals and precursors.  The site complimented to resources at thehive.ws but both were unfortunately lost, so we've got the archives of the Rhodium to share with everyone!

This is a copy of the Rhodium Archives from August 2004, originally downloaded from erowid.org and redistributed at shroomery.org


The Rhodium went offline several months after this archive was created so it may not be completely up to date to the shutdown.

If you are security concious, I suggest using the Tor network.

Please assist us by seeding this torrent to a 1:1 share ratio before shutting down your client!
