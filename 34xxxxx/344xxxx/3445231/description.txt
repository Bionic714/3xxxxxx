Review by Daniel Gioffre 
This is the finest album from Michael Hedges, the man who is 
responsible for the greatest revolution in solo acoustic guitar playing 
since Leo Kottke. There are moments on Aerial Boundaries where it 
seems literally impossible that so much music is coming from one man 
and his guitar. Attacking his instrument, snapping strings, banging on 
the fingerboard with his right hand, Hedges plays supremely beautiful 
music with the technique of a deranged lunatic. It has been said that 
genius is at least one part madness ? although a questionable 
assertion in general terms ? when applied to Hedges and his music, 
the analogy holds. The songs on Aerial Boundaries are all beautiful and 
haunting in their own right; and it is this emphasis on composition over 
technique that makes this such an important recording. Hedges 
makes the breadth of his musical interest known by the inclusion of 
the extremely interesting electronic piece, "Spare Change." Even 
though the liner notes assure the listener that the guitar is the origin 
for every sound heard, Hedges has electronically manipulated some of 
them to an almost unrecognizable point, yet he has still managed to 
create music of untarnished beauty. There is something of the music 
of minimalist Steve Reich's (thanked in the liner notes) in this track, as 
the cycling, overlapping guitar tracks are almost trance-like in their 
repetitiveness, yet utterly musical in their constant revelations. Aerial 
Boundaries is simply one of the finest acoustic guitar albums ever 
made, and deserves a place in the library of all serious music fans.
