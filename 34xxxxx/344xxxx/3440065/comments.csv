Thanx for the release !!!"

Do like the other! change name on the .ORG to .rar !"
,juanpolloloco,2006-07-02T04:54Z,"Great torrent! Good job! And to open, just rename the .org part to rar.

,kalona,2006-09-06T22:22Z,"I am new so can someone please tell me what a torrent is? also I read the other comments and downloaded WinRar and it still won't open. In fact, it does now download the enitre file. And it doesn't end in .org it it stays as a .tpb.torrent. i also tried remaning it as one of the commenters stated studio.8.final.by. etc;

Can someone clue in this newbie? thanks in advance

kalona"
,cessy389,2006-09-12T02:39Z,"Hey kalona, to use this file, you must have a bittorent client. Google ""Ares"" or ""uTorrent"" and install those programs (they are free). After they are installed, open up THIS torrent in your bittorrent client (Ares, Utorrent, etc). Then it will start downloading (it may take a while). After the this torrent is finished downloading, change its suffix to .rar then open in winrar and run the setup.exe file. Hope I helped out :) !"
,fintupp,2006-10-07T17:11Z,"Eftersom den som lagt upp denna torrent bytt ut filändelsen till .org istället för .rar så fungerar det inte att bara dubbelklicka på filen. Man kan istället högerklicka och välja ""öppna med"" och sedan winrar därifrån, eller starta winrar och välja file ->open därifrån.

Because he ho made this torrent has changed the file extension to .org instead of .rar you cant just double click on it to open it. Instead right click on it and choose ""open with"" and then choose winrar, or start winrar and choose file -> open."
