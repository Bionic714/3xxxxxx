AVI, WMV MPG et al ARE compression formats. further compression in a container such as RAR and ZIP will generally only regain an extremely minor amount of file space at the cost of greatly increasing the chances of file corruption. this is not a good thing. 
if there is a need to pass protect the files case you should set the (RAR, ZIP) compression to ""none"" when creating the container. 

not trying to be an ass, just thought i'd throw it out there.
