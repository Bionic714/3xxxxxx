Does anyone have a working link to the GPS Tuner 4.2 keygen? I would very much appreciate it.

Thanks,
Shaun."

If you change your clock on your pocketpc back, you can run the program after the demo has expired.  kind of a pain, but it works.

old dos trick that usually doesnt work anymore"
,Torxbit,2006-04-18T00:50Z,"Version 3.6 is VERY old.  Do not waste your time.

You can download version 4.2 from their wesite directly but I do not have a working keygen for it.

Please note, the version 4.0 keygen WILL NOT WORK.  You need a 4.2 keygen."
