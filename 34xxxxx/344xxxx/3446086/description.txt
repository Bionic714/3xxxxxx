"Teach Yourself Better Chess" by Bill Hartston.

Teach Yourself Better Chess is for all those players who know how to play chess but would like to be better at it.

In 75 easy-to-follow lessons, the reader is guided towards an understanding of correct strategy and tactics. Each new concept is explained in depth, followed by an example of the idea in practice, usually taken from grandmaster play. It delves deeper into the principles of good chess, explaining how there is an underlying meta-principle concerning the deeper laws of co-operation between pieces.
Bill Hartston, the author, is an experienced and well-known International Master and writes the daily chess column in The Independent.
