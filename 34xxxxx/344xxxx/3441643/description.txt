Army of One

Documentary released in U.S. January 2005

In the wake of 9/11 three young people join the U.S. army, seeking direction in their lives. They discover that unless they conform fully to the army values, their personal issues are only magnified within the military. What unfolds is an intimate and heartbreaking account of their two-year wayward journeys. In stark contrast to the portraits of willing patriotic soldiers that America sells at home and abroad, these recruits? stories reveal the more realistic, troubled conflict of American youth trapped within a military mission much larger than themselves.
