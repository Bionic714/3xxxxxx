Creamfields was a 2004 double album inspired by the Creamfields festival consisting of electronic music tracks by various artists mixed by DJ Paul Oakenfold.

This torrent contains this album, ripped in MP3 format with a reasonable quality of 192 kbps CBR (Constant Bit Rate). It was encoded using LAME, one of the best MP3 encoders available (the quality of MP3 depends much of the encoder used).

The MP3's are splitted in their respective tracks, not mixed like many shares. I think this is better, because it is much easier to record them in a CD. Also, it is better to select the tracks you really want to listen. If you prefer the one-MP3 format, you easily can mix the tracks using SoundForge or another sound editing program. To split the tracks of an already mixed album is very much dificult, and error-prone.

Includes playlists and the cd-cover. Total size: 190.13 MB.

** WARNING ** 

There is another torrent which claims to share Creamfields. However, it is just a joke, it is not Creamfields, not even Paul Oakenfold. It seems like video-game soundtrack.
