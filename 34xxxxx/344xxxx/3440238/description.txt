Working non-stop for six months, the members of Cairo have recorded an album with the instrumental firepower of Emerson, Lake and Palmer and the intensity of Dream Theater. Not a band with the emphasis on understatement, Cairo makes the most grandiose musical statements heard in years with no concern for what is "cutting edge" or trendy in today's music market. Cairo uses the technology of the '90's with the spirit of the '70's and is proud of their roots in the world of prog rock and symphonic music.
