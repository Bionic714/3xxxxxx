RELEASE NOTES:                     
                            
Styvfittur Gerhardsdottir. Born and raised in the Icelandic
woods with his parents, he early found his interest in
creating music. When he only was five years old he got his
first piano, and when he was nine he began to take lessons 
in playing organ in the church. Actually he played the organ
during every sunday for three years, and he has in several
interviews claimed that he ranks himself as a master on the
organ, an instrument that often is used in his songs.
Styvfittur Gerhardsdottirs first album - simply called
"Tree Of Life" - got released on the 17th of June
(Iceland's National Day) in the year of 2005. An album
containing everything from soft and emotional piano to
heavy-beated organic power.
