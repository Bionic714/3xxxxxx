,Botch,2006-02-05T14:38Z,"Wow, yet another constructed personality by someone who's done a pretty crappy job :D

First and foremost - the name: (never minding the first name styvfittur i.e. stiffcunt with the ""icelandic"" ending ""-ur"") If it's an icelandic man he whouldn't be named gerhardsDOTTIR, since it's the feminine ending (but of course a woman wouldn't be called GERHARDSdottir, since the start of the surname always is the name of the parent of the same sex and gerhard is a male name)... 

And: if it's an icelandic artist - why's his homepage on a Swedish server? ;)"
,MagicalBoostaRipper,2006-02-05T14:41Z,Okay. Have you listened to the music? Quite groovy.
,Botch,2006-02-05T17:42Z,"Haven't listened to the music, just dissin' the persona ;)"
