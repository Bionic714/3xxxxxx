,Tsuketh,2006-02-25T03:38Z,"Is there anyway to get the full registered version, for free of course?

I just downloaded a game that is .bin so I need ISO to access it and install it. Yet it is about 500mb and the minimum size you can copy to make an ISO image is 300mb for the unregistered version, the one you have given us here.

Can anyone help me?"
,Nirvana_soad,2006-03-06T16:23Z,if u downloaded a bin file then there should be another file to because u use the bin file only to open the shit... mount the bin file with poeriso instead

,kckewlz,2008-07-04T20:59Z,"To laurie123:
I think you are out of a torrent downloader.
try downloading BiTorrent, Azerus Vuze, or Utorrent. You can download those from the homepage of TPB. under the searchbar click ""how do i download?""  Hope that helps."
