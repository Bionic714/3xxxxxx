,Clercx,2006-07-28T09:50Z,This guide is statistically and factionally MISLEADING and will cause people to lose money. I know because I deal with stats for a living and I've seen more than enough people lose money by following ridicilous and pseudo-scientifically NONSENS. There is NO mathematical way to consistently win on roulette and even Einstein himself already proved this. Concerning bias: each respectable casino monitors the tables statistically so if there is something wrong with the table technicially the first ones to find out will be the casino not the players.

According to probability, you can win at roulette only if the betting limit is infinite."
