,SirTobey,2006-02-18T16:44Z,Can't seem to find the Alpha Centauri.ini file
,nil7,2006-02-18T19:55Z,The .ini file should be in the root of the install directory. Both SMAC and SMACX works fine on xp in all the cases I've tried. But you might have to click continue or ok a few times to start the game.
,Malak,2006-02-24T16:12Z,"SMAC alone works, but after installing Alien Crossfire the game stops functioning. I get to the menu where you choose between 'Alien Crossfire' and 'Classic'. After clicking either, it just shuts down. Any help would be appreciated."
,Arkkis,2006-03-03T11:35Z,I've got the same problem... anyone knows how to fix this?
,sets_01,2006-03-06T09:47Z,"had the same problem but now is everything ok.
there is a crack file in the alien crossfire part, just use it. You have also to change this .ini thing to 1. Dont remember if I also used the official XP patch. Hope this will help."
,Arkkis,2006-03-07T12:04Z,whaddya mean with changing the .ini thing to 1?? O_o
,sets_01,2006-03-07T13:55Z,"Ok, the torrent contains a .txt file which describes everything you need to know (only to run this game, not for your life ;-)) but I am a user friendly guy so here you go:
Find Alphacentauri.ini file  (or something like that maybe only alpha.ini) in your game directory and change the line 
""ForceOldVoxelAlgorithm=0"" to ?ForceOldVoxelAlgorithm=1?. 
If you cannot find the line, add it at the end of the file with the line [preferences] above it and dont forget to save. That is it.
Hope this will help, if not I will write a step-by-step guide. ;-)"

,nil7,2006-09-04T22:15Z,Since you don't describe your problem any further I assume you're having troubles with the ISO format - download and install daemon tools from http://www.daemon-tools.cc/ and use this to mount the .iso files. Daemon tools creates a virtual cd-rom drive from where you can install the game as usual.
,staarbux,2006-12-01T14:31Z,"I doubt anyone is still checking this but here goes:

I downloaded this file and installed SMAX to my already existing SMAC game. I'd read about the problems encountered so after I did it, I installed the XP patch and changed the dialouge file. Its still not helping. I can run the classic version of the game now (after clicking through the CPU error message) but it still cuts out when I'm trying to get to SMAX. What gives? The alpha.ini file definately says ForceOldVoxelAlgorithm=1 not ForceOldVoxelAlgorithm=0. "

"
,Wopatoolie,2008-02-25T17:22Z,"How I installed on Vista and XP with no cd:

Open with Daemon Tools. DO NOT click auto-start, click open files to view and copy them to a separate folder you will remember (it helps to wait until after you do this to smoke that phatty)

Now open with Daemon Tools again and auto start

After the game is installed and it doesn't work for you in some way or another, find the folder in your hard drive program list where the installed game files are located (I click computer once, then double click on the C drive to bring up the Programs folder, it's in there under Fireaxis Games). Open the Fireaxis folder and leave it open but minimize the window

Remember when I told you to open with Daemon Tools and DO NOT auto start but instead open the files to view and copy them to a folder you will remember? Go to that folder now

Now open the crack folder and copy the two cracks (there is a third file - text - but I didn't need it so I left it alone)

Open the Programs window you minimized earlier and paste the two cracks into the Fireaxis folder (NOTE: There is a significant difference in the size of the files and I wasn't sure if I wanted to completely copy over them, so I chose to paste them into the folder but kept all as separate files)

Now, after I copied the cracks to the Fireaxis folder there is terranx and terranx(2). Double click the terranx(2) file. (or if you totally copied over them there will be only terranx, click that)

NOW you can smoke your phatty and play the game, but make sure to place a shortcut on your desktop or next time you go to play a game you'll have a perfectly good one installed but won't remember it because you are STONED

I just got started on bit torrents about a year ago after using normal p2p networks for about 3 years and I like torrents much better. So far here I have found at least a half dozen ways to get these games to work; what works for one person might not work for another so if this doesn't work for you I dunno what to tell you, look around here in Pirate Bay I'm sure you'll find the solution.

If this works for you take a hit or two for me pls k tnx :P

,Wopatoolie,2008-02-25T20:13Z,"and i never said anything about updates because mine isn't updated, so if you fk around and update your copy then it doesn't work don't come back here and leave a msg to bitch 'cuz it's your own damn fault :P"
,M-Cos,2008-02-28T04:40Z,"IF YOU HAVE HAD TROUBLE PLAYING THIS BECAUSE THE GAME CRASHES YOUR SAVIOR HAS ARRIVED!!! 

1. Make sure you have done a complete installation of alpha centauri.
2. Make sure you have done a complete installation of Alien Crossfire.
3. Make sure you have this ForceOldVoxelAlgorithm=1 in your Alpha Centauri ini file. (Its the one with the gold thing on the notepad)
4. Now you must google a valid no cd patch for Alien Crossfire. I know they are not easy to find as it took me quite awhile to find one that worked for me. I would link it but it is no longer a website. 

Once you have done all this the game should work just fine. You just click ok if it says the CPU is not supported. If it still crashes you messed up on a previous step and must repeat. It took me like 3 tries of uninstalling and reinstalling. YOU DON'T NEED THE SMACX update on the firaxis website to get this to work!!!! Hope it helps some of you guys.

1.	deal with ?SMAC-E1_0Z? first. file comes in .iso format. I unpacked using PowerISO.
2.	open up the folder you unpacked to. Double click on the file ?SETUP? (with the blue computer screen) to install the program. Be sure to perform a complete install when prompted.
3.	do not play the game now or view the readme
4.	Now do steps 1-3 with other iso you?ve just downloaded, titled ?SMACX?
5.	Find the folder you?ve installed the game to. This should be somewhere like C:\Program Files\Firaxis Games\Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri
6.	find the file that deals with the configuration settings. It is named ?Alpha Centauri?. Open it with notepad and copy and past the following 2 lines under what?s already written.

[preferences]
ForceOldVoxelAlgorithm=1

7.	now open the folder you extracted SMACX to and find the folder named ?crack?
8.	there are 2 files called terran and terranx. Drag these into the installation folder and replace the existing files
9.	click on the file ?axstart? in the installation folder to start the game. You should make a shortcut to this and put it on your desktop
10.	you can now delete the folders you extracted the first .iso?s to, but do not delete the original .isos 

Now you?ve got a classic game in full working order. There is no way to legally download or purchase this game from the developers so its survival depends on people like you to seed it. As long as you don?t delete the original download folder (and there?s no need to) you will seed whenever your torrent client is running? at the moment I?m up to 3.5 ratio.

However, I was able to fix it by going into Task Manager and shutting down the install from there. Afterward, I got a pop-up asking if I wanted my settings to be altered so the install would run more favorably. I did, then tried again and it worked. I had to do this for both the game and the expansion. Afterward, I put in the patches and everything works just about perfectly. Sometimes the screen blinks to the desktop for a moment, but it jumps back to the game just as quickly."
