,requieminadream,2006-02-22T11:03Z,"Very nice posts! I have most of the discography, and all of the songs you posted, but the more people hear NIN the better. You are a good man."
,nutmilk,2006-03-28T18:26Z,"what a shit collection of mediocre tracks.

cut it to ten tracks and you have something."
,aocrkid,2007-02-07T04:18Z,seed0 is the shit
,azazan,2007-04-02T17:27Z,"damn it! missed part 1 + 2. Help? Anyone?
And yes. seed0!"
,charfordcharford,2007-04-29T04:28Z,"Pretty good. Took fucking forever though. No joke. Over a month on a good connection. 
Seeding. "
,overlydiatonic,2007-05-17T00:32Z,"I know this is a long shot, but any chance anyone has part 1 or 2 and could re-torrent it, now that they're missing? I'd love to even know the track list for them, actually."
,overlydiatonic,2007-05-20T05:02Z,"Never mind my request for the tracklist... the Wayback Machine has it:

It's interesting that this was posted by the same user who later posted the high quality Broken DVD and Closure DVDs. It makes one wonder if seed0 = Trent Reznor himself, or someone acting on his behalf... that would be pretty cool in a way."
,amelya,2007-11-17T17:06Z,"thank you ;)
I definitely adore you"
,R4W,2007-12-28T00:51Z,seed0 strikes again. o:

,zoenevergoes,2008-08-12T04:39Z,"After seeing them live in Toronto last week my nin obsession has returned in full force, discovering these seeds is such a nice addition.  Best band their ever was or will be."
,armacoust,2008-08-23T16:10Z,"Best band their ever was or will be - yes!!!! u a absolutely right!!!
i can't find The Definitive Nine Inch Nails: Deep Cuts - torrent is not found"
,prisefighter13,2008-09-04T12:06Z,"hehe, I'm pulling this in for two tracks I don't yet have, the artwork, and the html file.   BTW, tracks 8 and 12, just consistantly blow me away.  And the Precursor mix of Closer is about the ONLY version of said song I haven't yet gotten burnt out on."
,NINgod,2008-09-13T01:24Z,you people do know that seed0 is trent reznor right?
,daveyjones1111,2008-12-03T22:52Z,"The only seed really worth downloading, imo. Beautiful work here..."
