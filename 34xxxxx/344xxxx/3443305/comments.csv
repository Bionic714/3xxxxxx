,mikerm,2006-02-11T23:28Z,"all installed/cracked ok..but cant run the navi2002 faster app, says component missing...if this cant run any faster than it does on my 3970 it will have to go..shame as set up is nicer than tomtom, how does it run on other machines?"
,mikerm,2006-02-12T00:28Z,"ok i figured it, you replace the main program .exe with the faster one...but its still too slow, a quick hunt on google confirms that ..this s/w is known for being too slow, shame the maps are presented well and has some nice features but TT5 still rules..thanks 4 the up and a chance to try"
