Symphonic Slam is perhaps the most over-looked progressive rock band ever. With a musical quality sky high above most other bands of the genre the Finnish-Canadian Timo Laine (keyboards) teamed up with drummer John Lowery and guitarist David Stone on this 1976 album. Just to whet your appetite, I can inform you that Stone plays a 360 Systems polyphonic guitar synthesizer. Remember, we're speaking 1976! (I think Steve Howe used to play one, but I'm not sure)

This upload is a vinyl rip. The album was re-released as a cd in the US in 2001 or 2002, so it is available, but I don't know the quality of the commercial cd release. For all I know, it just might be one of those "audio-restored" vinyl rips, but I'm not sure.

If you like Emerson, Lake and Palmer, Yes, King Crimson, U.K., or ASIA, give this a try. After all, it's for free.
