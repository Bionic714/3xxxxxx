,Harry Q Hammer,2008-03-25T19:11Z,"Hi naxosking,

Thank you so much for your continuing supply of hard to get music from yesteryear.  Many of these works are virtually impossible to get anywhere else!

Could you please do us downloaders a huge favor by jumping back on this torrent as there is a bunch of us who have been stuck at 48.4% for ages.

Thanking you in advance for your assistance.

Regards,

HQH.
