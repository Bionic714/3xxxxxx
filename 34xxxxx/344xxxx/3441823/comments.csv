that was  the first post"
,elshiftos,2006-03-25T00:55Z,Thanks for this!
,erik82,2006-04-29T20:29Z,"Not even close to complete. Not even half of the episodes in there, and not even half of the ones actually available. A lot of them were not recorded too. The person who wrote the info has no idea about this topic."
,rss_mafia,2006-05-01T12:46Z,"I've published an itunes rss feed with all 20 volumes from season 1.. ive also joined all the wma clips from each volume into m4a files.. so youve got 20, one hour long, clips instead of 200 3 minute long wma files.

Go here http://seej.hopto.org/?p=4 and follow the instrucs to add to iTunes. (Just drag link to xml file into itunes and it will start downloadin).

I guess its faster this way.. and easier.

****I'll also be posting the remaining clips from ""the early years"" and ""season 2""****"
,Pilki01,2007-04-24T15:59Z,"Use the other torrent on this site. It includes ALL the XFM joined in mp3 format with id3 tags. It's a pretty big one but trust me it's worth it.

,FelixDeluxe,2010-01-06T21:59Z,"The Office was made a couple of years before this show started so it's a bit askew to say they ""later set out to conquer the Comedy World with The Office"".

Not that it matters, and thanks for the torrent.
