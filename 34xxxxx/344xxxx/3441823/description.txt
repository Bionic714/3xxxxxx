This is a repost of my Ricky Gervais Radio Show Archive.
Since Ricky's Podcast (available from Guardian Unlimited, hosted by Positive Internet) just received a Guiness World Record for ?Most downloaded Podcast?, I'll bet there's a lot more people out there who might be interested in this:

This is an Archive containing all Episodes of Ricky Gervais, Stephen Merchand and Karl Pilkinkton's Radio Show on London's Xfm Radio Station.
They did this Show from 2002 right up until they started the Podcast.  
Ricky met Stephen Merchand at Xfm and together they started a Radio Show, with Karl Pilkington as their Producer (LOL).

This Show is where the famous Duo, that later set out to conquer the Comedy World with ?The Office? and ?Extras?, first started out.

Consider it an extra 48 Episodes of the Podcast, since they've been talking the same drivvel for Years now!!! (Monkeynews etc.) It's hilarious!!!

I'm reseeding this because I hope someone helps me seed (I only have limited Bandwidth). 
The first posting was my first uploaded torrent ever and I think I kept the Description a little too short for people to notice...

All Files are in WMA Format for smaller file size.  If you want to listen to these on your ipod simply import them into your itunes as mp3 and copy them onto your ipod.

Have fun, and please help seed...
