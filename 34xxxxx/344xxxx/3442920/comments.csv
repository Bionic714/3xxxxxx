If you are looking for free, decent, objective and scientfically based information on odds, please consult my site http://www.john-solitude.be BEFORE you lose your money."

,JenniPoP13,2010-11-29T04:23Z,"Statistics have absolutely NOTHING to do with Roulette!  If black comes up 50 times in a row, does NOT mean you have a better shot at betting red.  It's not like poker or blackjack, where you know how many cards there are and can count probability... Every single spin on the roulette wheel is completely independent from the another, and does not affect the odds AT ALL!!!  AND IT NEVER CHANGES!!! THere is no way to win more money!  Pick red, black or 0/00... Same thing goes for lottery numbers.  C'mon people... stop being desperate and use your heads.  It's common sense!!!  Want to up your chances at winning?  Learn card counting, the +1/-1 method.  It's easy and does affect your winnings... but that would mean using your minds.... hmmmmmm"
