,jojoroxx,2006-09-20T19:09Z,"Any chance of seeding this a little more?I'm at 71.2% for a few days now and would love to have the whole movie!!
thanks"
,ressasaur,2006-11-10T04:52Z,Thanks for the DL. But alot of us are parked out here for weeks at 71.2% complete. Any hope of getting seeded again. Please!
,jojoroxx,2006-12-03T18:56Z,"Still at 71.2% I guess I may never get this movie.

Thanks anyway."
,ressasaur,2006-12-10T05:21Z,"PLEASE NUKE THIS TORRENT, if the uploader is not going to be nice enough to reseed it for us. I downloaded the NEIGHBORS-1981 torrent on Oct-29-06 and 6 weeks later I am still stuck at 71.2% like everyone else (at least 12 other leechers). Problem is no seeder!  If you leave this torrent up, someone who could upload NEIGHBORS-1981 for real will think by seeing this one displayed that it already is available and not load it.  Thanx, ressasaur"
,Ruud_van_Dan,2007-02-13T01:56Z,Please (pretty please) seed!
,Frontier314,2008-08-08T18:19Z,"Thank you very much.
Can we have a seeder please?
I am at 99.8% for over a week now!"
,gonzo_don,2008-12-12T03:25Z,"99.9% and the damned thing won't unpack without an error - the file is corrupt.  I'm sure if I could get the other .1% it'd work, though.  Let's go, folks--I'll seed for a year."
,AlejandroSosa,2009-10-04T12:57Z,"Hi. Everybody has 99,9% now. Can you please finish the upload now? Only 500 kb needed!"
,korovah,2009-10-08T08:53Z,"E che cazzo faccelo finire!!!

Seeed please!!

;-)"
,Penelope987,2010-01-25T09:57Z,Hi. I have 99 % !. Please seed !.
,yoncenator,2010-04-22T10:37Z,"Well the last time micknil uploaded anything was this file in 2006. Don't waste your time or disc space.. it won't open and is forever at 99.9%

I'm not sure how rar s work but the last 2 files are the ones missing.  Almost as if they were deleted then uploaded without on purpose. I can't get it to open.  It's an .img file.

thanks for nothing"
,Avant80,2010-05-11T12:14Z,PLEASE SEED!!!
