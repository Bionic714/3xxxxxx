,gouac,2006-02-21T17:42Z,"the System requirements are wrong.

tu use premiere pro 2 for exemple you NEED XP sp2 and an SSE 2 compatible CPU.

is After effects 7 the pro vesion ?"
,Narayanananda,2006-02-21T18:40Z,"It is the Standard version of After Effects 7.
XiSO apparently did not have the Pro version when they did the compilation.
MAGNiTUDE have released the Pro - do you need it badly?"
,Smith,2006-02-21T19:46Z,"Standard or Pro version of After Effects depends only on the serial, the install-files are the same.
Some Pro serials:
1063-1535-4179-2577-6240-4974
1063-1255-2746-6312-4425-3143
1063-1596-5389-1390-2550-9210
1063-1431-8714-6347-9915-4616
Use the keygen only for the activation codes."
,Narayanananda,2006-02-21T20:23Z,"Smith, thank you for the information, I did not know that.
This explains why the keygen says Pro but the installer says neither Pro nor Standard."

,halomasterchris,2006-03-09T06:08Z,"""There is not enough space on the disk.
!   Write error: only NTFS file system supports files larger than 4 GB""

Dude, wtf? >."
,SoundWall,2006-03-09T08:15Z,"halomasterchris,
This file is in an ISO-format (it contains everything on a DVD in a single file). This means the file becomes really large. ONLY NTFS-filesystems support files over 4GB (which this file exceeds). Therefore your FAT-filesystem will not allow this file.

To convert your filesystem to NTFS, you must format the harddrive you want to store the file on and choose to format it to NTFS rather than FAT. Remember, a formating DELETES all your files on that drive, so be sure to make backups!"

,Levontaun,2006-03-10T05:56Z,"Soundwall,

A better solution would be to create a partition on his hard drive and format it in NTFS.  I'd also recommend that he upgrade his OS... Windows XP is NTFS only, as far as I know."
,CasperLT1,2006-03-10T06:16Z,"Atmosphere 1.0 as well doesnt open after installation,just an unknown error.Any ideas?"
,halomasterchris,2006-03-10T14:17Z,"I'm actually on Windows XPSP2 and it's FAT32...

Could be because I bought this laptop with a pre-installed version of Windows on it, meaning the company, Acer, formatted it to their liking and I have no support from Microsoft.

How can I create a partition? Sorry, I'm new to this type of thing. This is the second computer I've owned, had it three months. The other computer I have runs 98 and is 7 years old; totally different. (This laptop has more problems, oddly enough. It pisses me off. -.-)

Anyway, I'd appreciate any help I could get, and thanks ahead everyone. :3"

,mhedhli,2006-04-04T20:23Z,"halomasterchris: Sounds like your trying to decompress the RAR in a FAT32 partition.  Uncompress in an NTFS formatted drive or use a program like partition magic to create a temporary  5 gig partition for the uncompressed iso.  Unrar, burn... and done.  I reccomend backing up all your data and using an NTFS formatted drive though."

,Islandstone007,2006-04-27T16:53Z,"Man, this is awesome :D Works great!

sn.avinash, you should download Daemon Tools
http://www.daemon-tools.cc/dtcc/download.php

If you do so, you can run the CD as a virtual drive, instead of burning it to a CD.

Install the program and run it. Rightclick on the Daemontool icon in the tray and point to Virtual CD/DVD ROM. Select a device and click on Mount Image. Click on the ISO-file and select open, and it will start the installation in a few moments. Shouldn't be very hard :)
If you need more help just ask."

,swat_sniper154,2006-05-20T00:47Z,what is the Serial # for Premiere Pro 2.0??
,POBSTAR,2006-07-03T16:58Z,"Hyway To Easy Work

For your knowlage keep in mind that you never register a software using your phone.

When aske how you want to register you use the phone activation when reguested by the software installation. Or some time at first use of the program install, you enter the serial number provide by the crack or the Keygen Generator that is located somewere in the download.

You will need also this free software to read the nfo files that come with the torrent. NFO Viewer that you can get for free at: http://www.softpedia.com/progDownload/DAMN-NFO-Viewer-RC-Download-2132.html#

PS: keep the link of softpedia.com cus for the present time it is the best clean download Windows software Website. ( You can get there all the Windows application that you can't get if you are bust by Windows Update or Microsoft Update.)

But remember that in some case on Adobe program you will have to proceded like this.

First generate the initial serial key when it is need by the program when it is installing at first. So you should have on fonction The Keygen Generator active. You past the serial in the blank field of the installation.

Secondley when you activate the program for use for the first time a screen will ask you to register the software. Use the phone registration. In this screen you will see a second row of serial digits. Copy those in the second blank space of the Keygen Generator an activateit.
It will give you a third serial key set that you enter in the blank space of the screen.

Be sure to enter it manualy this time.
After your done."
,POBSTAR,2006-07-03T17:22Z,"You could register online the software for downloaded update at the location of the software developper if you want using a .hotmail.com or yahoo.com E-mails address. Don't use your internet provider E-mail address if you don't want problem.

For seeding now: when your download is done let it continue working. It will transform automaticly in Peers seeders until that it upload the same amount of bits downloaded. Then if you want to seed as a Seeder you will have to look the right way to do so within the program you use or in the website of your torrent software in use. Look at the FAQ section.
