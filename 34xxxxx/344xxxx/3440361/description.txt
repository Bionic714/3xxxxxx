I left this as a single 1400 MB file. I find that I never bother with burning a pair of 700 MB files to 2 CDs, but rather, I just watch them from my hard drive, and having the file split into 2 parts merely complicates things. Plus, these days DVD burners are so common and DVDr's are so cheap, why not just drop a few 1400 MB files onto a data DVDr and call it good?

For those who do prefer to burn 1400 MB video files to a pair of CD's, I assume they know how to split a 1400 MB file anyway. If not, just ask in the comments section here. It is fairly quick and easy to do.

Anyway, for those who haven't seen this movie yet, it is good, funny as hell IMO. For Marisa Tomei fans, or fans of hot-blooded Italian women in general, Tomei is at her best here. 

This is a 1400 MB XviD AVI with the original AC3 audio (48 kHz, 192 kbps, 2 channels) with a video bitrate 1444 kbps. This file was ripped from a Region 1 NTSC DVD.
