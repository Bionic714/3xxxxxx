,claroque6,2008-04-08T14:50Z,"The subtitles are almost totally bullshit...
I don't know who made this, but people who doesn't understand french have no idea what 
the dialogues really mean..."
,acutturi,2008-06-21T14:12Z,"The crappy subtitles ruined the film.  They make absolutely NO sense in English and are written by a non English speaking translator. 
That said, the movie was horrible anyway.  I can't belive rottentomatoes gave it such a good review.  Usually I agree with them, but not on this one.
Love the torrents and thank you for the wonderful selection you have posted.  I am not really into bitching after all of the films I have enjoyed from your collection, but the subs make this one not worth the download for English audiences.  Peace out, homme."
