,HumbleGod,2006-02-06T23:53Z,"""Best of Lia Loeb""? So can I assume this is just the CD single for ""Stay""?"
,pulse_780,2006-09-13T01:21Z,"Actually smart ass, she released A few #1 hits in canada, and also most of her albums have graced the charts in the USA and Canada.  Where's your Greatest hits album?  Oh thats right YOU never did anything well..."
,pulse_780,2006-09-13T01:22Z,"Oh, and wasn't she like the first unsigned artest to go platinum? hmmm..."
,pulse_780,2006-09-13T01:22Z,ever?
,Zayla,2007-03-18T00:32Z,Hmmm....  platinum yet un-signed to any record label to produce and distribute the albums. Interesting.  Can I have some of what you're smoking? Good stuff evedintly.  
,Arx-,2007-05-03T04:06Z,"lol... You're on TPB, and you're suggesting that we need record labels to distribute albums.  Something ironic about that."
,Arx-,2007-05-03T04:09Z,"Pulse: You're probably referring to the fact that she's the only unsigned artist ever to hit #1 on the charts in the US

I guess this thread's probably a little cold by now though. ;)"

the things we end up reading on the internet.....
someone just use the CD name on the torrent and there are people that don't understand that...."
,knightofmists,2007-12-22T06:31Z,thank you :D
,gnj1958,2008-07-18T06:45Z,"Thanks for the up.

Actually Lisa Loeb has had 3 top 20 singles in the USA.

In any case it's a best of album not a greatest hits album. A best of is a compilation of the artists ""best"" songs. They don't have to of been hits."
