,qwertyf6,2006-02-08T19:30Z,Please keep the task after the downloading and help me seed and spread Passport 's music all over the world!! It's worth...
,gabriel42,2006-02-08T22:47Z,Great ! Perhaps there are more in your collection for share... ;)
,qwertyf6,2006-02-09T02:12Z,"i might share an other progressive (rock this time) band from Greece (Socrates is the name). Or a psychedelic jazz hipie band (Sweet smoke), maybe i'll make a collection of nice bands and share. I will inform. I also want to tell that Passport are from Germany."
,gabriel42,2006-02-09T08:00Z,"Ooops, sorry, I should write ""Perhaps there are more Passport albums in your collection for share... ;) "". Back in '70s and '80s I used to listen them a lot on vinyl. Klaus Doldinger has really made a great contribution to European fusion scene with his Passport projects. Been looking for them in the last two years, but apparently they are hard to find in digital format :(. Anyone...more Passport please ! :))) "
,jimgraf57,2006-02-10T00:17Z,"You should also try listing your torrent as ""Passport"". I've beem looking for their work for a long time and searches have come up empty."
,qwertyf6,2006-02-10T00:33Z,jimgraf57 if you search passport you will also get that torrent (it is listed as passport too). I have three more albums of passport but not in digital format (i have them on vinyl) and at that period i don't have the equipment to convert them. But i will try to do that. I think Cross Collateral this their best album.

,muizer,2006-04-25T17:03Z,I agree Cross Colleteral is their best album  So get it on !!!!
