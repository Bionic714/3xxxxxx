can I ask you where you get the episodes, i've been  downloading most of the newest episodes at www.matmaly.com/tracker but they have stopped uploading there now after the ""The Great Eight Fate!"" episode, it seems like that anyway.
Can you plz send me a PM or something and tell where you get the episodes from? would be very thankful.."
