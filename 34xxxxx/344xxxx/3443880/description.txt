Treasure Island is a boys adventure novel by Scottish author 
Robert Louis Stevenson, a thrilling tale of "buccaneers and 
buried gold". First published as a novel in 1883, it was 
originally serialised in the children's magazine Young Folks 
between 1881-82 under the title The Sea Cook, or Treasure 
Island.

Traditionally considered a coming of age story, it is an 
adventure tale of superb atmosphere, character and action, 
and also a wry commentary on the ambiguity of morality?as 
seen in Long John Silver?unusual for children's literature 
then and now. It is one of the most frequently dramatised of 
all novels, and its influence on popular lore about pirates 
can not be overestimated.
