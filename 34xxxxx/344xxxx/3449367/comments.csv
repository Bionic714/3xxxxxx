,casso11,2006-03-22T17:31Z,"yes, the red discs are done by Sony (I guess all of them) and people have great difficulties trying to read them. Sometimes it is necessary to read the disc with 3 different programs to be able to decode it all. Heres an advice - dvdfab can be extremely helpful on most occassions :) ... By the way, thx for this"
