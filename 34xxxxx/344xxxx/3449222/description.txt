The mystic Soma-plant symbolizes that element behind all sense-
activities and their enjoyments which yields the divine essence." 
SoMA, the album celebrates creative activity, "...the principle of bliss
...Ã“Oh sing a song, a song of praise 
to the clear and swiftly flowing 
Drop of crystal with a thousand eyes 
-Rig Veda IX.60.1, Hymn of Purification 

The word soma appears over 3000 years ago in the Indian Vedic 
scriptures as the divine nectara drug/food with powerful physical, 
mental, and spiritual properties. According to one commentator, Soma 
is "...the principle of bliss...the essence, in sense-objects and sense-
experiences, in the plants and growths of the earth-nature. The 
mystic Soma-plant symbolizes that element behind all sense-activities 
and their enjoyments which yields the divine essence." For the 
classical Greeks, soma meant 'body' and is the root of English words 
like somatic. (Soma also appeared infamously in Aldous Huxley's novel 
Brave New World as the quasi-narcotic pleasure drug which kept the 
masses quiescent.) 

"We wanted this music to feel primordial, not technological," says 
Robert Rich, "...to stimulate the body as means of joining the 
physical, mental, and spiritual in a journey of almost psychedelic 
intensity." 

By turns earthy, danceable, sensuous, erotic, psychoactive, and 
mystical, SoMA's heady brew of organic percussion instruments, 
pulsing heartbeat rhythms, airy ethnic flutes, keening slide guitars, and 
dense synthesized ambiences might well be labeled "Terratronic." With 
SoMA, Steve Roach and Robert Rich have taken another powerful 
step on the road to reinventing contemporary music as a shamanic 
practice.
