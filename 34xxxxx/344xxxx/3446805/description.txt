David Cole visited Auschwitz in 1992. He paid extra for a personal tour, and he wore his yarmulke to make sure everybody knew he was Jewish. He made a video about the contradictory aspects of the Holocaust. The JDL reportedly threatened to kill him. The Holocaust is a significant part of human history, and it is still affecting our lives. We have a right to learn about it. Don't be intimidated! If Jews can investigate the Holocaust, so can goyim!

David Cole: ''The Holocaust is an event that has seemingly grown in importance since the end of the war, taught as fact... usually accepted without question. But how do we know it really happened? What 'proofs' are offered for those not willing to take history on faith alone? This video deals with, among other things, one of those proofs, one piece in a very large puzzle: the supposed gas chamber at the Auschwitz Main Camp. It is by no means intended to be the last word on the controversy, but just the opposite. I hope this tape can begin an open debate that's long overdue: what is fact and what is simple wartime propanganda.''
