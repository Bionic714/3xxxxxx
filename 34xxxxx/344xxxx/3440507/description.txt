Such a beautiful, powerful and intelligent album. Something For Kate's second release saw them move from their amazing debut, to a more mellow sound, and a more complex arrangement of song structures and riffs. And what a great move that was. Having said that, this album does have some rocking tunes on it ("Electricity", "Hallways") This album is filled with beautiful, complex, intelligent guitar riffs. The drum work is also innovative, but not dominating of the sound. And the bass really complements the sounds laid down by the guitars. It's just got a really great feel to it - I can't recommend strongly enough listening to this album. They pulled the album off live on tour, and they are the one Australian band (in my opinion) who consistently deliver good releases.
