Reminds me of the old Knitting Factory days when the cappuccino machine would go off in the back of the hall during the set - real John cage silence!
I've been leeching for the last six months at 86% and someone just came online and brought us up to 95%. hopefully someone has the last 5% somewhere ;-)"
