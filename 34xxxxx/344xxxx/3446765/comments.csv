,speakeasy,2006-02-19T23:30Z,"From the nfo:
This movie is in Russian language. We decided to release this movie anyways. We included the Russian subtitles in Subs folder so someone can translate it. Or wait for a subpack"
,acme420,2006-02-20T09:02Z,"thanks for the up, i loved the first part, cant wait for the 3rd one."
,Cocio123,2006-02-20T15:27Z,So is this the second one in the trilogy?
,Frapp,2006-02-20T15:54Z,yes this is the second. Anyone found any english or swedish subs yet?
,alter.eego,2006-02-20T17:05Z,I have been looking for subs since it came out in Jan... No Luck as yet... Please post the subs if anyone finds them!
,Frapp,2006-02-20T19:40Z,we need a english speaking russian guy to do this for us!!!

,demoz,2006-02-24T10:54Z,"IDIOT you made mee look here 3 times a day.
"
,Dare2share,2006-02-24T12:52Z,"Be patient guys, be happy you already have the movie"
,Frapp,2006-02-24T19:47Z,Give us day watch subs!!!! Damn lazy russians...
,Stevvie,2006-02-24T20:49Z,"Frapp, maybe you should try to study russian language, if you not so lazy as we are. ;)"
,Frapp,2006-02-25T01:10Z,yeah... il start to studie right now. expect to se subs for this movie in 1-3 years.
,cstu,2006-02-25T03:23Z,"This movie will NEVER have official English (or non-Russian for that matter) subs because of the Channel One deal with Fox.  

Someone REALLY needs to translate this for us non-Russian speakers.  I'm probably not alone is saying that it would be GREATLY appreciated!!"
,el_pollo_diablo,2006-02-25T12:10Z,thats rubbish of course there'll be english subs. You think fox would finance a film that they couldn't sell in the english speaking market? 
,Stevvie,2006-02-25T22:49Z,"A raw translation (only first 20 minutes) with many grammatical mistakes in english:

http://webfile.ru/829732

If this is understandable then someone can fix it into normal english..."
,el_pollo_diablo,2006-02-26T16:22Z,"stevvie, I'll fix the grammar for the whole thing if u do the rest. "
,PrinceSilence,2006-02-27T05:08Z,So if someone send me (PrinceSilence@gmx.de)the russian .srf file I could translate it 2day.
,Stevvie,2006-02-27T08:36Z,"Ok, I'll do it. Give me a week. :)"
,PrinceSilence,2006-02-27T14:14Z,"DEAL!

By the way, I'd recognized, that the AC3, 6 channel russian version got the most amount of spoken voice in the Central channel ( as it should bee ); 'tis may bee possible to replace just the central channel in a spoken language of own choice, if there any reader with a rnice voice... just an idea, 'this is a lot of work; but could make the very first foreign version of daywatch in different language as russian"
,DZK,2006-02-27T18:37Z,"So what's the status on these fan subs? Any quality would be good--if you need another volunteer to edit/clean up/proof-read the subs, I would volunteer."
,Myglobe,2006-02-27T20:47Z,"Hey all, 

How's the translation coming along? I'm an English/Swedish speaking native Russian who works for the world's largest translation company. 

Basically what I'm saying is.. can I help? 
Lemme know. Asap. 
/E "
,the unforgiving,2006-02-27T21:20Z,hows these subs coming along? need to c this film nowwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
,el_pollo_diablo,2006-02-27T23:22Z,"status is we're still waiting for stevvie to translate the rest, but its only been a day, and he said to give him a week! "
,Stevvie,2006-02-28T06:25Z,"Actually, more than 2/3 of the movie is done already -- I need just a couple of days and then you all can edit my sub."
,stepa,2006-02-28T07:01Z,Can someone send me the .srf I can help finish the translation I'm a native english speaker fluent in russian.  Thx.
,PandA,2006-02-28T14:46Z,"Yeah this is truely great. Imagine how mutch money companys could save from pirates translating and doing all in their power to get a sub for FREE. Think how mutch faster they could get movies out on dvd and sell them and still make tons of money since the dvdmarket is doing REALLY good allthough piracy being ""an issue"". This is teamwork and true wonder dudes!"
,maxxxim,2006-02-28T17:04Z,"wtf this is the second movie of daywatch you dont get this film if you havent seen the first one, I didnt....by the way BOTH MOVIES SUCK!!"
,ninahartley,2006-02-28T18:19Z,"Jesus Christ, how can you fix the .srt translated in to english and host it in the asshole of megasignup? For feck sake, put it up here at Piratebay pronto, thanx! =)"
,stepa,2006-02-28T21:18Z,The subtitles you sent me are in Russian.  Which parts still need to be translated?
,Bedömaren,2006-02-28T22:55Z,stepa - start from the end
,stepa,2006-03-01T02:14Z,what prog do i need to use on this... i'm not used to dealing with .idx and .sub sorry :
,texize,2006-03-01T09:11Z,"I'm also curious about how people edit .idx/.sub files or convert them to .srt. The only program I know that does it is subresync, which comes with the vobsub package, and its not very good. "
,lawngnome2005,2006-03-01T09:44Z,"I don't really do any subtitle work but a friend of mine pointed me towards 

http://urusoft.cjb.net/

 for subtitle workshop"
,texize,2006-03-01T09:55Z,"""subtitle workshop"" is a good program, but I can only get it to handle text based formats, and .idx/.sub (i.e. vobsub format) is imaged based."
,stepa,2006-03-01T10:03Z,That's great but what I'd like to do is just translate the existing Russian subs to English rather than making new English subs with new timings and stuff.  In the current state the .idx/.sub won't open in any decent program I've tried.
,texize,2006-03-01T10:24Z,"stepa, I know how to break an .idx/.sub into individual numbered images. If you could write a text file that gave the translations, I also know how to merge it with the timing information to create an .srt. I'm sending you a piratesbay message with the details."
,Stevvie,2006-03-01T11:51Z,"Here. Good luck with fixing! ;)

el pollo diablo, your fix was attached - and it was COOL, let alone that it takes 3 days for me to download this file from megaupload:)"
,MorganPlus8,2006-03-01T15:28Z,"I can't speak Russian, so I can not comment on the accuracy of the text, but it certainly looks good and is sync'd properly all the way to the end. Fantastic work, and thanks for the efforts of all involved!"
,SGTUSMC,2006-03-01T15:49Z,"Stevvie,

Good job!

I used Subtitle Workshop to split it into two files by frame number and it works just fine.

Thanx for all the work.

SGTUSMC"
,djmicro,2006-03-01T17:01Z,"If SGTUSMC can upload his splitted files or if someone tells me how to do it.. I can go through the subs and correct the grammar .. I can even translate it into Swedish if you want.. 

Just need to know how to split the file .. 

thanks for translating it Stevvie :D"
,djmicro,2006-03-01T17:02Z,"Oops .. never mind .. I forgot that I hade subtitle workshop :D

Will try to translate and correct A.S.A.P"
,aion81,2006-03-01T17:23Z,"Mr SGTUSMC 

Could you maybe be so kind to upload the splitted sub, I think that would make alot of people happy. Especially me!"
,SGTUSMC,2006-03-01T19:06Z,"Here the requested English Subs.

And I did the opposite; used a direct stream output from VirtualDub to append the two .avi files together."
,monsterland,2006-03-01T21:42Z,"FYI here are my English subs for this release

,el_pollo_diablo,2006-03-01T22:31Z,"thanks stevvie! 

I got the full srt file, I'll have a grammar fixed version soon

I have read the readme and will be taking out your notes as instructed! "
,piet,2006-03-01T22:55Z,"Great work on the subs.

The subs are a bit to fast to read sometimes.
That's why I generated a srt file which shows the subs for as long as possible.
Without changing the sync of them with the movie.

Here it is:

,mro3dl,2006-03-02T22:48Z,Hi lad's I feel very humbled after reading all the work done on the subs.  I have downloaded the subs and also the movie is on it's way down but I need one of you boffins to explain what has to be done to include the subs within the burn...................kind regards
,Stevvie,2006-03-04T16:42Z,"El pollo diablo, please mail me your sub when you made it - stevvieAyandex.ru 
I want to add some in-movie sings to it."
,v00513,2006-03-04T18:13Z,"Sorry I know our movies are better then your typical swedish and american trash. Dont watch our movies, and dont blame us for not making subtitles.  We are very sorry we were born better then you. These movies were made by us, for our people. If you dont like it then shut the fuck up."
,H0zz,2006-03-05T11:54Z,Swe sub ??
,djmicro,2006-03-06T09:19Z,HoZz.. I'm working on it :D
,MegatonSE,2006-03-09T23:14Z,v00513 -> Sounds like you did not get your morning vodka?
,mro3dl,2006-03-15T16:07Z,"Will somebody be so kind as to explain briefly what has to be done with the avi file and the subs,  what software etc ????????.  Have managed up untill now but cannot even get off the starting line with this one.....in anticipation.regards d:-)"
,thelost,2006-03-17T00:48Z,"anyone know what the guy says to Tamerlan at the beginning when he picks up the chalk? The subs are hardwritten into the avi, so weren't included in the 3rd part translation and it's kind of bugging because I feel like i might be missing out on something significant!"
,Stevvie,2006-03-21T11:52Z,"That's the final version:

,Deznaj,2006-03-22T22:53Z,"Fuck man, one half decent Russian movie and mister v00513 thinks that corrupt and bankrupt country of his is the icing on the cake....

If you don't have the money to make a LOTR, don't bother. If you do, maybe you should feed the hungry children instead...
"
,ghehcore,2006-03-23T02:05Z,Great quality. Great film. Thanks. :)
,Deznaj,2006-03-23T08:22Z,"Quality is good, but the movie sucks. While Day Watch was good te watch, this movie bored the pants off me. 'can't wait' for the third one...

Ow yeah, on the matter of the latest sub release: The text for the second disk is 5 seconds (+ 5) out of sync.

,Perenor,2006-08-24T19:46Z,"How's the speech in this Version, b.t.w. I've just started the download. I also got a version from Demonoid. And in that version the speech is very low in volume."
