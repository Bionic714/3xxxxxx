thank you, thank you, thank you so much.  I once had a nice collection of KLF material, but over the years those cd's and tapes were ruined.  Besides the information in the NFO, can you provide anymore info about this compilation?   ... again, thanks!

There even something here that I haven't even heard...
But where is the KLF vs the Pet Shop Boys single? And the classic ""whitney joins the JAM's""
this is not criticism mind you, I just wish I had those on mp3 also.
I have them on LP's but my LP player bought the farm many years ago ...

THX for the up, I belive there will be some new cd's played at work in the near future :)"

,OOHMATRON,2009-08-13T10:13Z,"1991 The White Room is shit copy.

What is the point in ripping to APE for the better quality if you are going to chop the ends off all the songs?"
,jaZz_KCS,2009-12-04T15:55Z,"@OOHMATRON: 

lol, the spe files were ripped accordingly, they segway perfectly into each other, meaning that exactly where song 01 ends, song 02 starts, guess you were not knowing the album you were downloading after all... first listen, then complain"
,bopadum,2010-01-15T00:27Z,Thanks for this. Good Torrent.
