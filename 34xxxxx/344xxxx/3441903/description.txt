These are all 4 Pittsburgh radio broadcasts for the Steelers 2006 playoff 
games. They were downloaded from nfl.com's Field Pass in Real Media format and 
converted to MP3. I split the files up into approximately 1 hour segments for 
easier navigation. The recordings are obviously not CD quality, but they are 
only voice recordings anyway. Also, since this is raw footage from nfl.com,
nothing has been edited. The gaps throughout the recordings are spaces where
the commercials were.
