Burnersware RogueBot 7in1, and AFKTools (needed to run Rouge) for use with WINDOWS FFXI ONLY! 
PS2 ppl, i'm sorry, go buy a PC...better graphics anyway.   



7in1 includes: 
Fishing bot that is compatable with the updated fishing system, 
Powerup bot for powerleveling, 
Summoning bot for summon magic skillups, 
Enhancing bot for ehancing magic skillups, 
Bard bot for singing/instument skillups, 
Party bot for use in exp pts, 
and a 'Voke bot for claims. 

the only ones that might have any serious problems are the fishing and 'voke bots, since they're more or less out of date. i know for a fact the fishing bot works, but not so hot on higher level fish. (it's best for moat carp)

be careful with Party bot, it's gotten more than a few ppl killed. 

as always, share when you're done, and keep the hatin' out of the post, if you don't like bots, don't download them...

Enjoy!
