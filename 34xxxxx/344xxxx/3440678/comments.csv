,MMacairan,2006-02-07T05:15Z,You da mann.  I practically had to beat my friends at work with a stick to get them to keep their mouths shut about the outcome so I could save it for watching this video. 
,Sektion8,2006-02-07T05:42Z,"eddiebyrd = Liar & Troll. Don't support someone who feeds us all lies. This version works fine through-out, is great quality, takes 2.5x less to download & store, and is in convenient XviD format. I'm continuing to seed this as fast as I can, and will do until the next event - It's a good event, and well worth watching. Get in there! (c:"

,voltaire64,2006-02-08T03:01Z,If it's upp'd by Noplis you should consider it good. No need to read and respond until after you've watch all the fights.
,marqdsade,2006-02-09T03:22Z,"You are the man Noplis.

,extremelyfast,2006-02-12T18:03Z,"I can't play it, explorer crashes everytime. I've tryed windows media player, realplayer, and cyberlink dvdplayer, nothing will do"
,Noplis,2006-02-13T22:58Z,"Explorer???  I dont know what your doing...But try to use vlc player You can find it here ==> http://www.videolan.org/vlc/ 
Download it and install it and then use it to see every movie you want...But dont forget to unpack the files first."
,deft187,2006-02-14T02:42Z,"I downloaded and just got audio, any ideas"
,SE_Viper,2006-02-14T22:14Z,Where is the figte whit Keith Jardine  and  Mike Whitehead  ??????  Sweet movie !!  damm where is this FIGHT ????????????????????????????????????
,madhouserevival,2006-03-07T05:47Z,Perfect copy. Thanks! For those who can't play it I just go inside the cd1 or the cd2 folder and  double click the 1st zipped file and winrar views the media file. (Any zip program will do) Double click the media file and it will extract to a temp folder and automatically play in your default media player. Windows media player works flawlessly on this file.
,cdog77,2006-03-09T06:42Z,"But dont forget to unpack the files first.
 what do you mean go and unzip all the files first and then watch it?"
,dr_dopamin,2006-04-16T12:36Z,"Whats going on...
