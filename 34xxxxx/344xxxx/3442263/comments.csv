,warrenberg,2006-02-09T12:34Z,It`s not so much a comedy as a documentary.
,Hampaman70,2006-02-09T12:47Z,"Yeah, I know! I'm sorry I went so hard on you. I don't like documentaries of that kind. Have you seen FULL FRONTAL with J. Robert and B. Pitt? I got the same feeling with THE ARISTOCRATS. "
,warrenberg,2006-02-09T13:22Z,"No, that`s ok. I haven`t seen ""Full Frontal"" I`m afraid, but I guess I`ll rent it now!"
