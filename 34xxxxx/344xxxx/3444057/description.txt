A couple of days early in the shop, nice!   OK here is #12 just got it today.   Some of you have been having problems running the games.

Well,  for what it's worth,  I copy all the files from the CD onto my daughters PC.  Then I 'create shortcut' from 'main exe.' and drag the shortcut to the desktop and rename it 'DORA #?' so that all she has to do is double click to start.

Otherwise burn the files to CD or DVD and the 'autorun' will kick in when you put it in the player and start it for you.
