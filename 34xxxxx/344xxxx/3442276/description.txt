how to patch 
- copy 0_text.afs,e_text.afs,0_sound.afs,e_sound.afs to any folder(ex, PES)
- install and run dkzstudio
- file -> open a file -> choose downloaded .dkz file
- patch -> apply patch in folder -> choose above folder(ex,PES)
- patch going on. wait about 10mins.
- finish dkzstudio. go to folder(ex.PES). you already got patched afs files.
- patched .afs files copy to xbox or burn DVD
- copy udata to xbox
- IMPORTANT - patch your default.xbe with patch.ppf which included.

## I would recommend lodmixer - amazing tool. also patch default.xbe with lodmixer.
