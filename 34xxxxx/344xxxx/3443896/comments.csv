Once again Whistler84, thanks."
,Stocko3000,2006-02-25T20:26Z,"Another thing, is it possible you can put the other disc you get with this on here? It's a warm-up CD that you get with the DVD. Thanks."

,whistler84,2006-05-29T22:57Z,"Haven't taken a look on this torrent for a while, but if you check again you might see that I didn't rip the thing... That there's supposed to be another whole CD with warmup seems strange, as there already is a chapter on warm-up in this torrent."
,kraxxibul,2006-05-30T17:31Z,"Whistler84: As you can see here:
http://www.melissacross.com/vocal_training_products.php?
There is supposed to be a warm up-cd with the DVD. The warm up on the DVD is just explaining the CD, you're not supposed to do all the exercises but just 1/4 of them (the ones in your vocal range, that is)."
,whistler84,2006-06-04T16:51Z,"kraxxibul: Thanks for the info, I had no idea that there was additional material. But as I said... I did not rip the thing, I only downloaded it from another torrent-site (took like 2 weeks to get it, yuck!) and posted it here to spread it. Its the only release I've seen of this. Sorry... :("
,EnoXon,2006-06-25T14:19Z,Some seeders would be nice :/

,whistler84,2007-02-13T00:02Z,"If you haven't seen it already, here's the warm up cd: http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3541493/Zen_Of_Screaming_SCREAM_EXTRA_CD

,Chestman,2008-01-11T02:06Z,thanks! i only wanna learn how to scream for fun :D
,Aryonas,2008-01-20T21:52Z,What order do you watch these movies in? Seriously. She's like all over the place with her instructions and she don't seem to teach you how to scream in a single lesson....
,Aryonas,2008-01-23T03:08Z,"Okay....ya. WHAT ORDEERRRRR DO YOU WATCH THESE VIDEOS IN??     What order, do you watch, these videos in? What order.......do you......watch.....these videos......in????"
,legacy5k,2008-02-06T00:44Z,"GUYS!!! LISTEN!!!!!!

Don't fuckin' bother downloading this.  It's not unsafe or anything, but it's INCOMPLETE.  It is missing.... well, it's missing the fucking ""Basics"" section.  They forgot to rip the most important fucking part.

You will watch all of these videos and think to yourself ""what the FUCK is she talking about??"" because you don't know what any of the vocabulary she uses is and you won't know the basic techniques.

There's a better torrent on isohunt I think, it's like a 6.5 gig rip of the dvd, get that!!  

This is good stuff though."
,legacy5k,2008-02-06T00:46Z,"By the way, no, it's not the warm up CD that I am talking about, it's a half hour video on the CD which is the basics.  It's the most important part and it's not in this torrent."
,legacy5k,2008-02-06T00:47Z,"I meant half hour video on the *DVD* btw, not CD... whoops"
,brohken,2008-03-05T20:14Z,"thanks! got the intro audio cd from one of the links here, it's complete now, much appreciated!"
,pashSANITY,2008-05-27T12:58Z,amazing 
,idiocyinbubbles,2008-10-29T03:58Z,PLEASE SEED THIS 8D
,nerverios,2008-11-27T09:51Z,"This is only missing the CD that comes with the orginal DVD case. If you find is helpful grab a legit copy off amazon she deserves the cash.

You can watch these in pretty much any order but i found watching them as titled:

1.opening (just intro)
2.screaming
3.speak
4.note and timbre
5.heat and fire
6.final words
7.tips from singers (testimonials)

Try b4 you buy, thanks for the share!"
