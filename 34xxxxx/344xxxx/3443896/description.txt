Finally here!

The Zen of Screaming features 7 .wmv-files covering tips and tutorials on how to improve your singing voice for agressive singing like that in a metal band and how to avoid injuring your voice over time.


Note: I did not rip and convert the original DVD, credit for that is enclosed in the .txt-file.

Happy singing!
