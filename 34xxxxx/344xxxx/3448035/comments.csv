,giessler,2006-04-10T14:47Z,I've recently dlded the original file from Flight1 and tried to unwrap it with Wildman's unwrapper and a number of others. They all work pretty good for me. I get the unwrapped installation file and a .lic file. 
,giessler,2006-04-10T14:48Z,"But when i try to install i receive the following message: ""The instruction at 0x110099df referenced memory at 0x00000000. The memory could not be written. Click OK to TERMINATE and Cancel to debug the program"""
,giessler,2006-04-10T14:48Z,Even with a .LIC file [utraffic.lic] created by unwrapper??? STRANGE!!! What's wrong? When it comes to registering the product [after copying about 1.3 GB of files on my HDD] it doesn't react and shows the above error message.
