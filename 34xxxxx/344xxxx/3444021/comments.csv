I found them on the internet in MP4 format and I converted them to MP3 format to be able to put them on my phone. I have listened to them twice now and I am working on my third time. Definitely opens your mind to the possibilities and makes you ask some serious questions of, not only our history as human beings, but also of our true reason for being here!!!"
