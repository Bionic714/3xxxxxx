Description: Most critics viewed Contes Immoraux as the start of Borowczyk's decline into soft-core porn; he has never shaken off the irritatingly misleading tag of "arty pornographer". The four short films of its portmanteau structure demonstrate Borowczyk's superb eye for painterly compositions, unusual framing/fragmenting of the body, subtle lighting, and the transformative power of his surreal approach to objects. "I want each object to be something other than neutral," he told Carlos Clarens in Film Comment. "I want it to take part, because we choose objects in life and we live with them. Through objects you discover human nature." This is Borowczyk the idiosyncratic animator talking, who, in his meticulous use of lighting, framing and editing, somehow brings objects to life even in his live-action films, encouraging us to think about and question the significance of our tactile/perceptual relationships to them.

Taboo subjects (for the time) like fellatio, masturbation, sex & death (the latter prominent in the vampiric 'Erzsébet Bathory'), and incest ('Lucrezia Borgia') are given historical settings. Candlesticks, a wooden doll, ecclesiastical vestments, organ pipes, cucumbers, robes, prayer books, antique erotic drawings (most of these in 'Thérèse Philosophe') and the sea ('La Marée'), assume as important a role in the finely detailed, eroticised mise-en-scène as the tableau-like human figures. Erotic gestures are ritualised, sexual and religious ecstasy conflate, and the sacred and profane become inseparable. As in much of Borowczyk's feature work, sex/sexuality becomes a disruptive, primal force engendering obsessive, even subversive, behaviour which threatens the social/moral stability of a particular community.
