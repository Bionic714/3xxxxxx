I think that the setlist was this:
1. ""(Gotta Get Some Action) Now!""
2. ""Move Right Out of Here""
3. ""Better Than You""
4. ""Toys and Flavors""
5. ""Like No Other Man""
6. ""By the Grace of God""
7. ""No Angel to Lay Me Away"" (?)

And yes, I've been a fan of Copters since 2000/01, the moment I heard High Visibility and I've seen them 7 or 8 times live."
