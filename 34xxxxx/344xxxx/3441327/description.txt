Red Bull Romaniacs DVD-preview in Sibiu

Sibiu isn?t actually Romania?s capital, but it sure is the capital city of the Red Bull Romaniacs. Over 150 helpers and partners, most of them volunteers, turned the Romaniacs idea and the Prologue of Andy Fazekas into a huge success! For those interested in this motor sport, a Video-Premiere was organized in Stage Club, Sibiu. Organiser Freinademetz held his first Romanian speech ? then 2 hours featuring the most difficult passages, the best helicopter shootings and the funniest scenes, followed. Babu and Pushok, responsible for the video edit, showed us a really cool enduro movie, in Crusty & Co style. The 2h DVD features shots from RBR 2005, but also a 20 min ?best of? RBR 2004.
After the movie, as it is in Romania typical, a huge party started. Not only having fabulous enduro-terrain, Romania has also the most nice-looking girls ever.
With some hangover, on Sunday morning, a crew of 8 started towards the Fagaras Mountains near Sibiu, starting the snowmobile season. For those who don?t have one, and have the enduro bike hibernating, there?s the alternative:
