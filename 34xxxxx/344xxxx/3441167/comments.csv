,Mr_Data,2006-02-07T01:41Z,"A good trick is to get a tool called ""tag and rename"" it will send the parameters of the track to a database and should name the track etc. Hope this helps"
,slimrotta,2006-02-07T02:05Z,"Thanks alot, folks! I knew I could cout on you :) Than you!"
,slimrotta,2006-02-07T02:12Z,"And yes, I have delivered a good hard slap to the back of my stupid head for not thinking of googeling the lyrics... :/ "
,duskboy,2006-02-07T02:37Z,"Mr_Data: sounds like a good idea but i guess it would not work in this case. the track sounded like it was recorded though a cell phone or something, i could even hear a dog bark in the background! ;) fot that to work i suspect the track in question have to repped from a cd, right? good songs though, DL three albums from (dare i say it) mininova."
