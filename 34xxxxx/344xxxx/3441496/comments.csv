,matt198992,2007-10-08T04:34Z,"this game isnt THAT old, but it is expensive as hell. i have to give this site it's props. i have gotten zork GI from here (granted it only worked HALFWAY, but i still got to play most of it) and i hope this works. its another one of my earlier-childhood games. i am 18 and this is one of the best windows games of it's time. it was made in 2000, so its about 8 years old almost. PIRATE BAY ROCKS! TY ALL!"
,laurrennie,2008-01-29T18:03Z,"maybe a stupid question, but how do you get the game to work once you've downloaded it? "
,Asobou,2008-01-30T17:35Z,I've got the same question as laurrennie. I'm pretty new at this downloading thing so I don't really know how to make things work. Would be happy if anyone helped me =3

,prandom,2008-05-05T16:35Z,"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neverhood

For more info on the game, it was not released in 2000 but 1996.  It was followed up by one of the greatest games on playstation; the platformer Skullmonkeys!  If you have a ps1 or ps1emu go dl the game:]"
,bernardronge,2008-12-27T14:05Z,"For Windows XP (just so anyone who needs to, knows) and higher, it will run under ""Compatibility mode"" with older versions of Windows.
Right click the shortcut.
Go to ""Compatibility"".
Tick ""Run this program in compatibility mode for:

Can't remember what ones work but use 95 just to be on the safe side.

I'm not positive on this part, but you might have the tick some of the other options on that tab to get it to work. Just see what works. One particular one I have a feeling might need to be ticked is ""Run in 640 x 480..."""
,vajenna,2009-05-21T01:56Z,"Hey just one problem.
  So I have Vista (64-bit) and it's being a righteous pain in the ass!  I did everything right, I used Daemon Tools Lite 4.30.04 to mount it, but when I go to switch it to Compatibility Mode it wont work because it tries to read the disk!  Me needs help.
Pleasssse, it's a great download currently seeding."
,mhelpern,2011-01-10T19:17Z,Everytime i run this game the game lacks horribly. It starts at0 the intro and then does it again as soon as i leave his house in the beginning of the game. I've tried windows 95 mode/680 screen resolution and 256 color mode. anybody have any idea why its doing this? thanks
,legalnycyklista,2011-01-23T02:48Z,"If your OS is a bit too fresh maybe try VirtualBox (free) with Win98se or 95?
Game just r0x!"
,narklo,2011-04-04T20:44Z,"
While I've had compatibility in the past with XP 32bit, this game amazingly works perfectly on Windows 7 Ultimate 64bit.

Thanks for the upload; a true underrated classic!"
