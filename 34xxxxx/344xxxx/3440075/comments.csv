,papabob2,2007-10-04T20:50Z,If you download this program you will be in a world of shit. Your computer will switch itself off a few seconds after it starts windows. Every time The remedy is to pull the power cord as windows starts and when you restart your computer you will be given the dos screen.. Choose start windows in safe mode then stop power iso on the start menu and delete it from program files.. not easy. be warned.
