"Remotion is musician Richard Stuij assisted by engineer Arjan 
Steenbergen.
Like contemporary Ron Boots, Stuij is profoundly influenced by New Age 
synthesizer Berlin School music in addition to the more accessible 
synth music as popularized by Jean-Michel Jarre.
The seven tracks on Between Fiction and Reality cover the gamut of 
these influences, from the Equinoxe-like opener ?Deep Down Under? 
to the late 70s influence of Schulze on the 14┬╜ minute title track. 
Remotion sticks largely to sequenced material in all its forms, and Stuij 
seems to be incredibly proficient with them.
Not only are the lines worked out and interesting, but sonically they 
are warm and pleasing to the ear. In fact, as the album progresses, 
the music tends to move away from the more upbeat influences to 
the world of deep New Age space music, all propelled along by inventive 
sequencing programming. The final, and shortest piece, is indicative of 
this happy marriage, coupling warm atmospherics with percolating 
sequences.

The production is the icing on the cake; Between Fiction and Reality 
being a strong example of a competent Germanic descendent."
