,megatorrent,2006-09-09T01:24Z,"Hi All, the reason that Yuris Revenge won't work on some computers is you need to update Red Alert 2 to version 1.006 otherwise Yuris Revenge won't work.

For those who can't find the crack, it's in the ""CRACK"" folder in the cd image. Just mount the BIN file with Daemon Tools to find it.

I have not yet been able to find a way to update the cracked RA2 to V1.006 because when you run the update, it checks to make sure that ra2.exe (and possibly game.exe) is original. If you are using a cracked version of those files then it won't let you update - so you won't be able to play Yuris Revenge.

If anyone has found a way to get the updated version 1.006 files please post it here so that everyone can run Yuris Revenge."
,ginesh,2006-09-23T06:22Z,"its very easy to convert bin file.
u must have winrar (or izarc) software installed on your pc.
open this bin file in winrar (or izarc) & convert it.
ie.. bin --> iso.

and burn this iso file in a empty cd...
now u had the full version & go ahead to install...

,ginesh,2006-09-23T06:30Z,"there is no need to udpate the game...

simply go to the below site:

and download izarc software, install it.

open izarc, goto Tools--> Convert to CD image.

simply convert that bin file to iso file.
and burn it in a blank cd.

easily install it & enjoy....
