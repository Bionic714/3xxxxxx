,hestkuken,2006-02-21T23:52Z,"Jeg får heller ikke noe til å fungere...har lastet ned alle versjonene av spillet som er lagt ut til nå ;( og HVORFOR legger ingen ved serial?? bare noobs som lager torrents idag?? Og CureRom, etc. er tull... CRACK spillene før dere legger dem ut, idioter!"
,The ceebee,2006-02-24T21:36Z,"First of all: FUUUUCKING nOOOBS: 
This download works perfect with the  curerom 1.3 pro. witch you can download right here 
http://thepiratebay.org/details.php?id=3447939
Ive just downloaded it and set it up, with the originla cue file of cd1. STOP Bitching!
If you want to donwload pirate warez, you need to be able to crack it or hack it! Otherwise stay the fuck away from it and buy it!
(you need to ann the game to the currom program, add the ""mount the disk with a image"" and get the exe file from the starwars dir. and click yes on the popup that come up before the game starts.) and voila. the game starts. "
,The ceebee,2006-02-24T21:37Z,ohh and thanks for the nice torrent:)
,carltonpalmer,2006-02-25T18:41Z,everyone was a noob once just like we were all virgins once
,MaStErDiSaStEr,2006-02-25T19:14Z,AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH rare folk you must have a NEC DVD/CD burner to burn out with blindwrite ONLY NEC AND SOME OTHER BURNERS SUPPORT PROGRAMS LIKE ALCOHOL AND BLINDWRITE AND CAN BRAKE UP THE PROTECTIONS AND GET IT TO ROCONIZED AS REAL CD
,Hullivier,2006-02-26T15:06Z,"I downloaded the 2 Cds version but I can't mount the mini-image included in it.  My alcohol say : ""fichier invalide"" (in french sorry).
Can somebody put a link to a correct image file so i would't have to redownload the whole game plz."
,silencio505,2006-02-27T06:21Z,"I finally got the game to work and now my vehicles arent showing up when i buy them, WTF is going on is it me or the game?"
,mwaker,2006-02-27T21:16Z,Direct cuerom to the installed .exe file. This worked the first time for me. Don't try to run from an emulated drive. (no need to!) Doesn't care if you install from a virtual drive or burned disk. I tried both. I used cuerom 1.3 pro.
