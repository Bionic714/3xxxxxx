,hetreft,2008-08-31T21:51Z,"Jesse_Kessu:
I havent downloaded this yet and thested, but shouldn´t you just double click the .bin file to start the install?

Note: You have to go from the deamon-ikon in the right bottom corner and browse the file from there when you open a file, or it will say error in command line for me too..."
,hetreft,2008-08-31T22:18Z,"Dont listen to my first post, ima get you some steps:
1. Download Deamon tools from thepiratebay if you dont already got it and install it.
2. Left click on the deamon icon in the ""activityfield"" / bottom right corner.
3 Choose a device and find the hearts of iron 2 map
4. Just doubleclick on the binfile named mx-hoi2int and the demoshield should start...

Pretty basic stuff actually, yall gotta be big time noobs..."
