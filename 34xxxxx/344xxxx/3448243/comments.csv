The Zapruder film is like a traumatic memory that gets sharper and sharper, thanks to advancing video technology.  Years ago, we could see JFK's head react to the force of the  fatal shot.  Now we can see the spray of brain matter, and the gaping white wound as Kennedy goes down like a sack of  dirt.

The most dramatic aspect of the film for me is Jackie Kennedy, who sees that something is wrong with her husband, and who is leaning in close, and look him directly in his face, when his head just flies apart.  No wonder she climbs up onto the back of the car!  Out of nowhere, this wealthy young socialite was subjected to the kind of experience that would later fuck up many a Vietnam Vet for life. "
