,filekÃ¤rring,2006-02-09T19:30Z,"Uh, subs and lecture(?)...In other words, a videotutorial that shows how to patch/pry open Splinter cell? "
,pokersucs,2006-02-09T20:07Z,"Still Starforce protected and they just came out with a new version.  There is no magic answer to play Starforce protected games other then disconnecting/disabling your IDE cables for your CD/DVD drives, which can be done via Device Manager.  Much better luck if your running SATA drives.  So the answer to this patch is no it won't allow you to play SCCT. "

,Sarre,2006-04-14T16:49Z,"I'm waiting for a non-Starforce release of the game. There's a 99SEK release coming in June, I hope it does away with Starforce so that I can buy it.
