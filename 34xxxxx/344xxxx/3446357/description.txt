At the close of the year 1941, the Japanese Empire unveiled its imperialist plans to unite the western Pacific under the flag of the Rising Sun. The name for the new territory would be the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere". Beginning with the unprovoked, devastating raid on Pearl Harbor, the Japanese military launched surprise attacks against key strategic targets in an all-out effort to secure victory. From Singapore to Manila to the tiny island of Guam, the nations of the western Pacific faced the most dangerous enemy ever...men who considered it an honor to die in service of the Empire of Rising Sun!
