,Blade0047,2010-06-12T11:13Z,Do they even have this in English? 
,rylin84,2010-07-21T10:41Z,"No there is no English Dubbed Version. Turn A Gundam never got released in the US. I'm not really sure why.

There are Subs however.

That said I just got this and I have to say I am loving it. The music is first rate and it has a definite twist on the standard gundam story."
,jon_mb,2011-09-02T20:01Z,"These are all of the episodes made in fantastic quality with fan made subtitles that are WAY BETTER then the ones that came on DVDs I got from Korea.

This series starts off slow (the first 12 episodes are real slow...) but it is the BEST SHOW I HAVE EVER SEEN! For real. You will love this.

Also, as a man with a beard, I love the mustache gundam, I don't care what anyone says about the mech designs."
,gravediggernalk,2012-04-29T19:10Z,"There IS an English Dub, but Bandai has decided to not release it, or many other things officially, because of money and the cost of DVDs or some BS like that."
