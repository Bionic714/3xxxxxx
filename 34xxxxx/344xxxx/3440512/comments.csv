,stargate70,2008-02-10T19:09Z,I'm at 90% and this book is awesome so far. I'll seed for at least a couple of weeks when I'm done.

They think by doing this they come across as intelligent, kindly and hip. Instead they actually are seen quite differently!

"" If Liberals Had Any Brains They'd Be Republican"". "
,thunderbum,2008-07-11T22:08Z,"@spaminator - great book, but needs to be seeded, please reseed? (Or could someone reseed?)

We still have freedom of speech here... at least for a little while....."
