Trials - The ultimate Babes v1.0
--------------------------------

This is my first MOD of the ultracool game "Trials - Mountain Heights"!!!


How to install+play:
--------------------
1. make sure you got the java runtime environment installed (JRE)
   (if not, go and get it here: "http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/download.html" and install it!)

2. Extract the contents of the zip-archive to any folder - e.g.: "c:trials-babes"

3. go to your install directory (e.g. "c:trials-babes") and double-click any of these files to start the game:
   trialsMH.bat -> Fullscreen, no OpenGL
   trialsMH_W.bat -> Windowed, no OpenGL
   trialsMH_ogl.bat -> Fullscreen, with OpenGL
   trialsMH_oglW.bat -> Windowed, with OpenGL

4. Have fun!



Notes:
------

Sometimes the game crashes (out of memory)... but I can't fix it as I don't have the source-files!

If loading takes more than 20 seconds and nothing happens - the game might has crashed...



And:
----

Some stages are quite hard to finish, but remember that it is possible to finish all stages :-)!

Hope you like it!
