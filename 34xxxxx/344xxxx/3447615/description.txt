Release Notes

[Product Information]

  These days, nobody really wants to learn everything there is about
  a software product like Photoshop Elements. And even if you did, who
  has the time to endlessly tinker and play with it until you figure
  everything out? You just want a book that will quickly show you how
  to do things with Photoshop Elements - things that aren't already
  covered in the docs, and things you can't just figure out on your own.

  Adobe Photoshop Elements in a Snap is designed specifically for
  today's computer user.

  --Somebody who is new to Photoshop Elements, but not new to
  computers.

  --Somebody who doesn't have time for long-winded, mind-numbing
  explanations - and certainly no time or patience for bad jokes.

  If that sounds like you, check out this book. Comprised of a series of
  well-organized, bite-sized, quickly accomplished tasks, the book lets
  you zero right in on the one particular task you want to accomplish,
  quickly figure out what to do, do it, and then get back to work.
