Plot

The sole survivor of an ill-fated mining expedition 
tells how his taste for gold was replaced by that 
of human flesh.

Taken from imdb:

"Cannibal! The Musical is now a small cult classic 
thanks to DVD. It deserves more because this is 
simply a great movie, with songs that will leave you 
laughing for days and some great pop-culture 
references. Oh yeah, and Japanese Indians. And 
Confederate solider Cyclopses.

I actually read about the real Alfred Packer on 
the internet and believe it or not, the movie stays 
true to what happened. Scary, huh?

Historical background aside, the one-liners and 
musical numbers (`Let's Build a Snowman' is 
unbelievably funny) are a good reason to get this 
movie. If you have a DVD player, get the DVD and 
listen to the cast/crew's drunk commentary. It's 
not very informative but it sure is fun."

Ripper's Notes


I saw crappy ~600 meg rips floating around the net
with this beauty, and I thought it was worth doing
a rip scene-style. Instead of doing the ordinary
procedure I decided to include the director's
comments track also, since they're pretty funny.
Instead of sounding important, Trey Parker and
his friends from the movie is drinking beer while
commenting the stuff on the screen xD
