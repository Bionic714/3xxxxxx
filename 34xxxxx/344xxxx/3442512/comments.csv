,Logue,2006-02-10T01:07Z,"Well... if it is episode 8, then its the one where Captain Hero uses his X-ray vision to spy on the girls in the shower. (Jan. 25 2006)  If its the one that is listed in the description it is  2x9 Captain Girl, which was aired Feb 1. 2006."
,0ggy,2006-02-10T08:57Z,"no, the one when captain hero is using his x-ray is episode 106, it was'nt aired last year becouse the actor who played superman died."
,denied,2006-02-23T21:05Z,"The link to tv.com is also wrong since EP 08 isnt captain girl but:

s02ep08 - 25 Jan 06 - Terms of Endearment

Captain girl came 1 feb...so next time you put out something be sure its the right file..."
