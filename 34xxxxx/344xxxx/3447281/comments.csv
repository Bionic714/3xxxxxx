,Ganellon,2006-09-25T01:42Z,"This program is simply amazing.

I was doubtful about the efficacy of this program, eschewing it for Chessmaster 10, but found they provide very different training experiences. Where Chessmaster seeks to be a chess ""companion"" for the beginner or average player, Chess Mentor is very strictly a training program for players of all levels -- including expert.

Chess Mentor is very accessible for the beginner. The lessons are extremely thorough and well-described. In the event you should make an error in judgement, Chess Mentor explains in great detail why it would be an error, whereas Chessmaster simply informs you that you made a poor move. For this reason, Chess Mentor is a far superior training tool because you can actually learn from your mistakes, and not be as likely to repeat them.

The interface is reminicent of ""old school"" Windows programs from the mid 1990s, but despite the mechanical ""feel"" of the interface, it is manageable. The toolbar menus are absurdly long and aren't self-describing (the price you pay for not having a printed manual). Options abound, and where many programmers would have put them on another screen, the options here are all on a single, gigantic menu. Bleh.

Apart from the interface being outdated and sometimes silly, the installer is not flawless. You'll want to make sure you choose NOT to install the Desktop icons when first installing version 2. It uses special characters that will make the icons impossible to delete when you've upgraded to version 3. This is more an annoyance than anything else, but now I have some icons on my desktop that are permanent.

To install the Sicilian and Knight's Indian modules, use the Chess Mentor Course Installer (found in the Chess Mentor 3 program group under the Start menu), and then navigate to the folder where you've extracted the .exe files.

To learn more about this program (and this torrent contains the entire suit of courses available for Chess Mentor), check out their website:

Awesome program, highly recommended for anyone wanting to learn about, improve, or master the game of chess."

,nymersic,2008-05-16T03:13Z,"Thanks dude; thanks, and thanks again."
,IndianaBrandon,2008-06-06T21:34Z,Thanks for this chief.  This is a very thorough chess program.  It teaches you a ton of things about chess.  Im impressed.  
,tec_wow,2008-06-28T19:17Z,"Great Program and memory friendly!
No matter what your level, this is a great torrent!"
,IndianaBrandon,2008-07-01T19:42Z,"Thanks a lot for this Xeno.  This program is the best training tool I have ever seen for Chess.  This isnt an engine for playing against, Xeno's other torrent Chess Genius will do that for you.  This has challenges that test you on a variety of things, like openings, tactics, endgames, strategy concepts by none other than Silman himself.  This even works under Vista, the only thing I cant get to work is the help files under Vista.  But the program works, and its awesome.  Thanks again Xeno.  "
,halofubar,2008-07-06T06:26Z,"Great program; full of a ton of options. Thanks for the up.

BTW if you want to be able to use the help file in Vista, just go to the Microsoft download for WinHlp32.exe at http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=6EBCFAD9-D3F5-4365-8070-334CD175D4BB&displaylang=en."
,IndianaBrandon,2008-07-19T09:03Z,"Thanks Halo, that did get the help files working.  "
,sedrol,2010-11-05T23:34Z,"It says it has 13 seeders, but I haven't gotten a bit for days... Anyone KNOW they are seeding?"
,daegen999,2011-05-01T17:57Z,During the set up installation process it asks for a name and company. I randomly put in a name and company and it didn't work. What should I do? Please help. How do you get past this?
,tkendall,2011-05-17T17:44Z,"This took me a while to work out how to install on vista - you need to go the the chess mentor website and download the demo, then use the upgrade to chess mentor 3 file, run in compatibility mode for windows 98/me and run as administrator. Amazing program once downloaded thanks xeno!"
,M-Gad,2011-07-20T15:43Z,"guys i have a problem, i am using windows vista, and whenever i try setting up version 2, the installer just freezes and doesnt respond at the end, any tips on how i can fix this or what should i do ?"
,M-Gad,2011-07-20T16:05Z,its freezes at C:\\Windows\Fonts\Comics.ttf please somebody help me with this
,NightPrince777,2011-07-30T22:49Z,Please seed guys!
,NightPrince777,2011-07-31T22:28Z,"Finally got this working!  Very complicated to do if you're running Windows Vista, but I managed to do it by reading tkendall's comment and with a little of my own common sense.  The basic steps are as follows:

Install demo from the Chess Mentor website.
Run demo.  Close demo.
Upgrade to 3.0 using the file in this torrent.
Set to run in Windows 98/ME compatibility mode.
Run as administrator.
You will now be able to use the program but will only have the demo challenges available.
Go back to the torrent files and run the 2.0 installer; this will now work (it freezes at 100% if you try this before installing the demo).
Run the ""upgrade to 3.0"" file.
Hey presto - you should now have all of the deluxe challenges installed in the program.  Feel free to install the extra challenges by using the course installer tool on your desktop.

I don't think I've missed anything - mine is now working perfectly!"
,Bala93,2011-10-25T13:57Z,"I downloaded the torrent and when I installed the version 2, it hangs in between saying ""the file C:\Windows\system32\Asycfilt.dll could not be opened"".

I tried NightPrince777's suggestion but the same glitch happens. Would be glad if someone can help."
,RachelAn3,2012-03-23T04:32Z,Its freezes at C:\WindowsFontsComics.ttf. IDK what to do.
