Here's the Jewel music video for her song "Foolish Games" taken from the Batman & Robin DVD.  Be sure to check out What's Simple Is True and her new "Goodbye Alice in Wonderland"

I don't remember how I came out with the What's Simple is True rip, but I think that it looks a lot better than this one.  If someone can help me make this one better, I would appreciate it.
