,juhhaidi,2006-02-05T14:28Z,to golem7...is there the new HAIR module ???
,brainz,2006-02-21T00:54Z,"I downloaded some version of the Cinema 9.5 release (perhaps this one or then Enorma Ulvens (http://thepiratebay.org/details.php?id=3446592)) it didn't have the Hair-module. I tried to copy the module from the demo-version of Cinema 9.5 but I could not get it to work, guess it needs a file hair.xdl. Does anyone have this file? Otherwise the release I downloaded was flawless."
,jcass,2006-03-04T19:54Z,"if anyone manages to get hold of hair, pm me pls. i need it!!"
,brainz,2006-03-09T17:14Z,"There's a plugin for Cinema 4D that can do almost the same thing as the Hair-module. It's abit tricky to use, but you can check it out.

Make a free account to C4D Cafe (http://www.c4dcafe.com) and in downloads look for ""Hair Dept - Monster Edition"". It might do the job of the Hair-module until someone finds it and posts it here."
,Shamrox,2006-03-13T18:50Z,does anyone know where i could find the mac 9.5 version?? thanks
,3Dpete,2006-03-14T06:11Z,I'd really like the Mac 9.5 version too. If anyone could help it would be greatly appriciated! Thanks
,mangofet,2006-04-10T02:26Z,"this is painful...the only person with more than 15% still only has 99.8%

being a seeder sucks these days eh?"
,c0,2006-04-21T00:13Z,"Thx alot golem7, Ive been waiting for a cinema 9.5 torrent for years ;)"
,RonnieLwd,2006-04-28T10:25Z,Thnx ! :D
,.hotzenplotz,2006-04-29T13:50Z,"whats the sense of including R9? Can't I just launch Cinema 4D 9.5 in the ""update""-folder? anyway, great seed."
,brainz,2006-05-04T23:57Z,Thanks juhhaidi. Your upload of the Hair-module works perfectly :D This is allmost an orgasmic feeling :P It's much easier to use than equivalent i posted (Hair Dept - Monster Edition).
,eyal89,2006-05-05T04:00Z,is it possible some more people could seed this one :) ?
,andyuk,2006-05-05T13:17Z,"Hi,

Thanks for this torrent. Is anyone having problems running the 9.5 keygen?

It crashes when I try to run it (winxp 64)"
,marinrider,2006-05-08T02:24Z,can anyone tell me how to open the torrent file. i try to open it win winRAR but i doesnt work. please help. thanks all
,brainz,2006-05-08T11:42Z,"andyuk: Try searching for the serial on http://www.serials.ws (your virus scanner might popup some warnings) or http://astalavista.box.sk.

marinrider: You'll need a program like Azureus, BitComet, BitTorrent (etc.) for downloading the .RAR-file. After that you should be able to extract it using eg. WinRAR... I remember having had some problems with WinACE so I think I eighter used WinRAR (a fresh version) or 7zip."
,juhhaidi,2006-05-08T15:54Z,"Update: CINEMA 4D R9.603

You dont need enter your serial number,if you have already activated ver. 9.521
