,mynameismatt,2006-02-08T00:00Z,"quick question for anyone who uses emule to download stuff for FS. Can anyone get the FSD Cessna 337 to work? When I run the keygen, it finds a serial but then the install fails, saying ""Data Member 1754112467993 has been corrupted by another program."" Am I doing something wrong here? Possibly a corrupt exe? Thanks for any help."
