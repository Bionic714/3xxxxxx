When you consider that of these victims many were incarcerated without charge or trial and then released, it's pretty rotten.

One guy held the knife that cut the throat of a hostage - not every Iraqi alive. Treating people like animals for fun is bad anyway you look at it.

Think about it."

If this happened to one of my family members you would have made an enemy for life.
And america is making enemy's by the thousands each day.

If i were an arab i would boycot american products and aim for europe and china.

Believe me, most of those prisoners get better treatment than prisoners here in the states). YOU ARE AN IDIOT. 

I plead with moderate Muslims to speak out against the radicals before it's too late or suffer the consequences.

Uh i plead to moderate christians to accept islam as a religion start a real face to face dialogue with moderate islam they don't need us we need them their oil, gold, gas, uranium etc. they have already accepted christianity as a religion you haven't accepted them.

Fair trade in muslim country's would also help 
all these slaves in mines and for products like chocolat. And most of these slaves are muslim.

Muslims aren't destroying the world the west is

My friends are moderate muslims i rather fight for them than your american foreign policies and i am a christian.

Accept hamas as democraticly chosen.
