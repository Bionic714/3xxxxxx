,zorax84,2006-02-08T20:32Z,"This is the European version, it works on 1.5 but the movies is relinked to the first movie."
,Mamba4ever,2006-02-09T00:17Z,Works fine on Firmware 1.5...you're obviously not doing it right!
,buffelko,2006-02-09T19:50Z,"It works fine on FW 1.5 with Fastloader 0.7. 

But, as stated by the comment above, all the movies in the game are the same - every movie is relinked to the first intro movie."
,swedench,2006-02-10T14:53Z,"Downloaded it, tested it on my 1.5psp-fastloader 0.7 and loved it awesom game.. thanks"
,jamsplodge,2006-02-10T22:03Z,"This game works fine on FW 1.5 with Fastloader 7.  Don't use UMDemu 0.8c as you won't be able to save.  And yes, all the videos are the same :/ I downloaded the Japanese version, ripped the videos out and put them in this ISO.  It works fine and I would recommend you do the same."
,demlanh,2006-02-11T09:14Z,"iÂ´ve loaded with Fastloader 0.7 but still can not save . why?
