,JustDownloader,2009-10-14T18:36Z,"hehe, lol. Mu last post is Funny, I hate when people write comments like, best made ever, SOTC 4EVER etc. and yet i writted that myself, but here it is really true ;). Graphic is 8,5/10, gameplay is 9/10 , soundtrack Top, Story is not very good but OK. 
Who is able to buy it, do it. It deserves the money."
,Shloive,2009-12-05T19:10Z,"For anyone who is having trouble playing this on PCSX2 emulator: first extract, then burn the .rar file onto a dvd (I used Nero 7, but I'm sure similar programs will work). Game plays pretty nice (40fps) if you mess around with Speedhacks (Cycle 3) and you might have to try different graphic configurations. This game works."
,RecycleBin32,2010-01-05T14:44Z,"can anyone help me.??

,Master-C,2010-06-28T16:51Z,Was wondering if anyone knows how to get this working with an emulator? preferably the pcsx2

,Azraelalpha,2010-10-25T10:41Z,"To properly backup this game in a DVD-R or DVD+R you need to use BlindWrite. This is the recommended app to burn Iso files for modded PS2 consoles. Just make sure you use the slowest speed possible (i know, it sucks).
If you need further information on how to burn them, just google and you will find plenty of tutorials   :D"

,Wwarez,2011-02-14T18:45Z,"Works great on pcsx2. file is very well-compressed. Running @ 60 fps using fairly low-end hardware. ... But I can't figure out how to grab on to the vines @ the temple.

,tqvaso,2011-12-05T16:50Z,"{___}Hey these are the steps to Make it work{___}

1. Download this game and keep it as it is
2. Download 7-zip (http://downloads.sourceforge.net/sevenzip/7z920.exe)
3. Open 7-Zip and go to Tools-Options and click on ""Select All"" and then click apply
4. Then click on ""Add"" and then locate the .tar file and click on extract
5. then open the location where you extracted it and you will find a .rar file
6. Open that .rar file and inside it will be a .iso file.......extract it
7. Burn that iso file on a DVD using nero or Alcohol 120 or any other burning software "
,thegwd,2012-05-10T23:29Z,"Works with PCSX2.0

Unzip, and open the iso with the emulator.
It is a tad bit laggy, but with some emulator tweaks and speed hacks I got the FPS up to 60, just needs some love tweaks and I'm sure it will be 100% vanilla.

Still great torrent! 9.9/10"
