,wittybob,2006-05-28T03:31Z,"There is one song in this collection that is not a Boston Song, it is titled ""Something About You"".

The song you have on this collection is by the group, ""Level 42""

So any downloaders, get the original Boston song to replace that one.

Otherwise, superfantastic upload !!!

""Surrender To Me"" is the 2nd track on 1994's ""Walk On""."
