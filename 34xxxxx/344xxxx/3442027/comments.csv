/b0skin  

P.S Written this while listening to the pieces of
*Dead In Mind* & *Frontman*
& *Beautyproof* :

""no boots & no directions,
no horse & no depression,
no bar & conversation
no need for no cancellation
no need to be aroused...""

and *Majesty* 

""So am I
Am I Good or bad ?
Could only awake your anger
I could only make you mad.
Now was that how you showed me
That you were still so young and bold
Anyway those fights did drive me
And I was dying of thirst and I wasn't growing old""

What a song !!!

I cannot buy Madrugada albums where I live (and customs tend to ""lose"" things bought on the net...), so I would really like to get my hands on this torrent."
