,raj2020,2010-11-19T19:28Z,It was fine in XP sp3. But when i installed in windows 7 it showed starforce protection error. I've downloaded & installed the update for it from the official website & boom everything is fine & working. No need to unplug DVD drives. http://www.star-force.com/support/sfdrvup.zip
