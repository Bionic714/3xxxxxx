,Socrat,2006-02-09T18:44Z,"Now that I've registered here I can thank you for all the wonderful films I've downloaded from you over the last few months.This one,in particular,sounds quite unusual"
,Jocke666,2006-02-10T05:45Z,"Thanks man, awesome!"
,Bluesoul,2006-02-10T15:56Z,"I'm flattered, but you really should thank the whole Freakyflicks crew for all the amazing movies they have brought to PB. I am only a small part of it ;)"
,Bluesoul,2006-02-11T10:58Z,"Tikvesh, I'm not sure how Nero handles subtitles (you should enable them in the options if it supports it) since i never used it for playing media files, but these two players handle them very well (Bsplayer autoloads all subs when filename is the same), i recommend using one of them ;)

,Bluesoul,2006-09-05T21:11Z,"Icitinuri try enabling DHT or force starting your torrent (in Azureus at least, other clients handle it differently)  PB must be having some problems with connections, but i can see there are seeders and leechers on it 2/6 at the moment, just really takes time to connect to them, which didn't happen before or on other trackers..."
,blrock69,2007-07-05T13:47Z,Please seed!! Thanks
,webfilippos,2008-04-06T13:03Z,"Thank you so much for the upload. To add, this is a superb video quality + U gave us the subs! Thanx and please keep on bringing us rare movies as this one!"
,rolleryankee,2009-01-03T23:59Z,I imagine this movie might be great for girls and women. It looks well done but didn't interest me at all. Just a lot of dancing and little girl talk. 
,moreisless,2009-08-20T02:24Z,"Thankyou for this. I have it on VHS. I don't understand it, which makes me want to watch it over and over, but I just think it is a beautiful and relaxing painting. My rule is; if it has less seeds then it will be a great movie; I haven't been wrong yet. I will seed this forever.  "
,Yumi-k,2011-08-15T08:57Z,"Excellent, I'm very grateful with you Bluesoul, I will seed it as much as I can."
