Lucile Hadzihalilovic has been among the most hotly tipped talents in French cinema over the last few years following her close association with Gaspar Noé? (she co-edited his Seul contre tous, he shot her medium-length The Eyes of Jean-Pierre). But shelve all preconceptions: her long-awaited debut feature Innocence is unlike anything you may be expecting. Haunting, boldly original and altogether uncanny, Innocence, based on a story by Frank Wedekind, is set in a girls' school situated deep in a forest, where new pupils arrive in boxes and are raised in a strict but benign old-world atmosphere. The girls live in small groups, each age allotted a different coloured hair ribbon, but the sweetly idyllic atmosphere has a sinister undertow. What happens in the main building, where the older girls go at night, and where do the mysterious subterranean tunnels lead? Innocence creates an eerie self-enclosed world, where fetishistic images of childhood and femininity are pushed to their limits. Hadzihalilovic's vision has echoes of artists such as Bellmer and Balthus, and film-makers Buñuel and Borowczyk, but from a female Gothic perspective that gives the film an edge that Angela Carter surely would have relished. A very young ensemble cast give a miraculous collective performance. It's a long, long way from Malory Towers.
