TagRunner brings you ID3 tags, cover pictures & lycrics for your music! TagRunner painstakingly searches for and retrieves automaticly all of the missing information for every piece of music in your collection. TagRunner automatically and simultaneously searches for your missing tags in more than 10 of the world's largest information sources. No other software solution puts this powerful feature at your fingertips.

Has good use if you have a big collection of music. Since it supports Id3 tags...it will work for mp3 and wma, but it also supports ogg (my favorite format).
From the same software maker who made Tunebite. Very easy to use and (almost) automatic!

Enjoy,
