Do you have the return to the blue lagoon too?"
,bulanfan,2006-02-08T19:07Z,"Yeah

A fucking DL for mono sound.

no way jose"
,Patton2,2006-02-08T19:53Z,"What?
Is it mono???
Did the original have mono?"
,Yahoo99,2006-02-08T20:31Z,Det finns ingen seeder... Synd.
,sneipenruler,2006-02-08T20:44Z,"In the spesifications it says mono, and it is from an original DVD.. but the movie is from 1980 so the sound isn't like the sound on new movies.. 

Just see the spesifications on this page: http://www.brafilm.com/film_fact.asp?art_id=105265&searchoption=Article

I have ""the return to the blue lagoon"" too, and if you want i can upload that one too. But I'll have to use a couple of days uploading this one first... :)"
,docka79,2006-02-08T21:03Z,"seeda, jag har försökt ladda ner den i 5 timmar och bra fått ner 0,4procent."
,Patton2,2006-02-08T22:28Z,"Ok, I've seen the spesification on your link. Looks like we've got no choice;)

,BBMF,2006-02-21T18:34Z,"UPDATE:

There was probably a slight mistake concerning the audio languages description...
After downloading the movie, i went to burn it and i've discovered that:

ENGLISH AC3 5.1 ch.
FRENCH AC3 2.0 ch.
GERMAN 2.0 ch.
SPANISH 2.0 ch.
ITALIAN 2.0 ch.

Enjoy !!!
