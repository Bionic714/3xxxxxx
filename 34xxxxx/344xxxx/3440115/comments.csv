,Chopzor,2006-04-27T04:29Z,seed for the love of god!!!!!!
,lormahoykyd2007,2006-11-19T20:52Z,"Yes please seed. I try to go and least a 3.5 to 4 on the scale, and I do keep the .torent files just in case I get asked to reseed something. I understand maybe not seeding if you doing something else bandwidth or CPU intensive, but seed again when your idel. Thats the only way this community stays together."

,Diceman_,2008-03-23T14:32Z,Hmm a 7:51 seeders to leechers ratio and 5.7 Gb... I'll probably be downloading until (southern hemisphere) winter. Might have to track down the DVD's...
