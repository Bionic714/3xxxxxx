..."Be it composition, arrangement, or musicianship, "On To Evermore" is a solid step forward on all fronts. Fans of the seventies symphonic rock sound would do well to check this out. Don't be surprised if this turns up on a lot of 'Best of 98' lists next year."

..."The group Glass Hammer has evolved musically over the course of their first three studio albums. This process has culminated in the concept album "On To Evermore"-- a work that encompasses the complete progressive package. Owing some narrative themes to previous releases, Glass Hammer hits a Grand Slam with their new master work and they don't forget to touch all the bases.
In 1998, Glass Hammer attempted a magnum opus of symphonic progressive rock, and they "pulled it off"! Give 'em a standing 'O'!"
