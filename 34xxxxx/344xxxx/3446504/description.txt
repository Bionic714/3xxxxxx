The story told in Frances Hodgson Burnett?s classic novel, A Little 
Princess, was first written as a serialized novella, Sara Crewe, or 
What Happened at Miss Minchin?s, and published in St. Nicholas 
Magazine, in 1888. It tells the story of Sara Crewe, an intelligent, 
wealthy, young girl at Miss Minchin?s Select Seminary for Young 
Ladies. Sara?s fortunes change when her father dies, and she goes 
from being a show pupil and parlor boarder at the school to a drudge, 
but eventually she finds happiness and a home again.
