This baritonic drivel, passing for psuedo sea shanty, is far beneath a great music culture like that of the Canadians.  For goodness sake, please dl some truly inspirational Gordon Lightfoot (who, unlike Stan Rogers, could actually play his guitar, ) or something original like the music of Kate and Anna McGarrigle.  But if you prefer to hear the lugubrious dronings of a man who once based an entire song upon his wife's desire to smell his old woolen shirt in bed during his absence (he was hewing wood and drawing water in the Great White North), then go ahead and dl Stan Rogers."
,EvilKidBugs,2006-04-07T08:40Z,"With the only comment for the Stan Rogers torrents here being the negative comment about the artist by duncanrinaldo, I guess ol' Stan needs someone to pipe up.

I like his music.  A lot of other people do, too.  It's a refreshing break from the repetitious themes of top 40 pop.

So, maybe some people don't know how to handle the sort of real-life themes that were Stan Roger's trademark.  Maybe they will learn to appreciate it after getting a few more decades under their belt."
,diane1974,2006-07-02T05:55Z,Thank you thank you. Not too many people know great music these days...There are so many Stan Rogers fans. Have you heard his brother Garnet he is almost as great as Stan Rogers. 
,IamMorphious,2008-02-26T05:28Z,"Yes duncanrinaldo , EvilKidBugs just said that you need to GROW UP ... as for Stan's music .. Listen for yourself .. and hear a piece for Canadain history.. "

""duncanrinaldo"" can go to hell."
,xollst,2008-08-10T00:43Z,"thank you so much! i have a tape cassette of northwest passage but no way of converting it to a cd, i've been looking for AGES for a torrent of this :) 

great album, great artist"
,musher77,2009-07-26T02:44Z,"Hey duncanrinaldo, you truly are deaf dumb and stupid, Stan Rogers certaily earned his place as one of the best artists canada has ever produced. It's a damn shame he was taken from us so young. Your low brow attempt at humor isn't impressing anyone. Especially those of us on the east coast where where canada and canaidian folk was born.   "
,shortstack,2010-04-26T05:22Z,"Garnet Rogers is also very, very good. Perhaps even better- keeping in mind he's had longer to continue his career- though he has a very different style of music from him, so it's apples to oranges.

I think Stan's son Nathan is also a musician. Quite the family!"
,Jarradf,2010-12-07T06:12Z,"Theres no need for that, duncanrinaldo. 
They are both fine musicians."
,Seth01,2010-12-24T02:43Z,Many thanks for this.  I do think that duncanrinaldo is entitled to his opinion however I don't agree with it.
,joemakaro,2011-07-07T05:54Z,Excellent! Thanks for putting this up. I have a tonne of Stan Rogers on Vinyl but no way of getting them digitized. Now I can bring Stan with me on the road.
,srennie,2012-08-19T15:49Z,"Duncanrinaldo is entitled to his opinion.
Duncanrinaldo has no taste save for that in his mouth. 
Air Canada killed Stan Rogers.
Long live Stan Rogers."
