,tilt-a-whirl,2006-03-11T04:55Z,"Unable to unzip the data dvd.  Any tips?  It checks out ok, but will not extract the DeLorme Plus 2006 data.zip, .z01, .z02, .z03, .z04, .z05 file set.  Tried winrar and 7zip.  Neither one worked."
,mollyasw,2006-03-12T10:02Z,How du you mount these files? Unable to unpack. Please help
,shithot,2006-03-15T21:22Z,Same here...  Can not unpack with Winzip or Winrar.
,shithot,2006-03-15T23:09Z,"OK, figured it out.  You need Winzip 10 to unzip data disc ISO, use DVD Decrypter to burn it to DVD, Alcohol 120 couldn't burn it."
,tilt-a-whirl,2006-03-19T08:37Z,"I figured it out too.  Updated my Winrar to 3.51.  Works.

I should have thought of that before.  Sorry."
