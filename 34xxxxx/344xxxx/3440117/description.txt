Description: Rainer Werner Fassbinder not only directed Ali: Fear Eats the Soul, but also scripted the film, designed the sets, and functioned as producer. Brigitte Mira heads the cast as a lonely German cleaning woman, who enters into an affair with equally lonely -and much, much younger- Moroccan mechanic El Hedi Ben Salem. They marry, despite the shocked, bigoted reactions of those around them. This thinly disguised remake of Douglas Sirk's All That Heaven Allows (cult favorite Sirk was one of Fassbinder's personal heroes) won the international critic's prize at the Cannes Film Festival.
