,zhosa,2006-02-04T16:23Z,"Great upload, thanks.
Does anybody have 'Satan's Brew'?"
,Bluesoul,2006-02-04T18:17Z,"Thanks Beksinski, always nice to see Fassbinder :)"
,kegir,2006-02-04T18:52Z,This is such a humantarian movie. I think i will see it a second time. Thanks
,kegir,2006-02-04T18:56Z,I mean humanitarian.
,joybringer,2006-02-04T19:29Z,"some Fassbinder's films are good (and certainly this one) but it has been too much overestimated for years, meanstream culture up to vomit. The topic of the gay/ethnic victim of society has been so much misused. And Fassbinder cinema isnt cinema but filmed theatre (like all US 'cinema' btw)

Sorry Rainer. I love you."
,Beksinski,2006-02-06T12:49Z,"Now that racism and bigotry are on the rise his topic is becoming ever more relevant to us and our time, don't you agree?"
,Bluesoul,2006-02-06T13:02Z,"Exactly, this kind of movies need to be made more often not less :). If the subject ""bothers"" people like Joybringer it may be also because he agrees with such (conservative/right wing) policies against minorities, marginal groups (homosexuals etc), immigrants.

Open your mind  jb..."
