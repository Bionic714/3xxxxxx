,belac,2006-04-28T16:30Z,if you are using bitTornado you can specify which font to download first then stop the download after you have the one you want.
,bogueart,2006-05-24T18:52Z,"Thanks for the upload but a ZIP within a RAR within a ZIP within a RAR file...COME ON, extremely shitty torrent format"
,monkeyphone,2006-09-05T21:12Z,"use Extensis Suitcase to handel all youre fonts.. by puting all the fonts in to C:windows\fonts you'll use all of youre memory(RAM). but by using Suitcase you'll save memory by turning the fonts ON and OFF as you like to juse them.!

,gokstad,2007-05-31T05:28Z,Narayanananda what tool do you use?
,kittytm,2007-06-13T08:33Z,Install utility like Font Expert then you can install fonts from 10xx folders (as long as they are sub-folders) with a single click :)
,tk88,2007-10-30T12:05Z,"Does anyone know where I can get the font: ""Univers 39 Thin Ultra Condensed"" for free? I am not willing to spend $29 for one font. Any help helps! Thanks!"
,Samol_123,2007-11-23T05:56Z,Hi! I'm getting a message saying that I can't download this file.. does anyone know how/where I can get the Helvetica Neue font family - i think it's one of the files in this download.  Any help would be greatly appreciated!

,StuperRicco,2008-05-09T10:35Z,"You have the Frankfurter Medium LET, Frankfurter SH and Frankfurter SB fonts? I'm not gonna splurge 75 bucks for 3 fonts :S

Thanks!"
,sfnchz,2008-07-22T19:04Z,"This torrent is the biggest Waste of Time ever to hit the screen. After it is un-rar-ed there are 452 folders each with another zip or rar to unzip or un-rar that contain .pfb .pfm .diz .nfo files

If you know the name of the font u looking for OK, but don't come here looking to find anything new without the early onset of arthritis of the wrist."
,duncanbmcg,2008-09-06T21:06Z,"This torrent is fine, you just have to be a little clever with your search and winzip functions.
Search the entire folder and sub folders for ""zip"", once it's done, select them all, right click and ""extract here"", then search again for ""rar"", select all and extract again. Now go back to the main folder and search the folder for ttf files. Copy everything it finds into your Windows fonts folder (that folder with siphon what it can and cannot use), search the entire folder again for pfm files. Transfer them over too. Voila"
,DJDSiGN,2009-01-10T22:46Z,"haha u guys ur stupid lol

installing so many fonts slows down your pc's booting time ;)"
,implaca1,2009-02-20T14:21Z,Many thanks for this
,adamch25,2009-11-15T18:48Z,"DJDSiGN, shit for brains. Try using a font manager program like Fontcase (OS X) or FontExpert (Winblows). You don't have to activate them all at once."
,stylishx,2010-01-04T22:31Z,"@DJDSiGN : we guys are designers , and we know how to use the computer , we start designing the day ur mother gave your birth , so behave and don't call anyone stupid ..

,wb21,2010-02-27T16:16Z,I cant find Guardian Egyption anywhere... costs like a grand... BTW the prefix FF stands for FontFont... its a bit confusing having a mix of both on this list.. ppl just write FF
,tdryan,2010-03-19T00:26Z,Great collection. Thanks to the uploader and seeders for the download =]
,ioannisarc,2010-04-03T20:49Z,Thank you very much.
[T],SceneRlz,2010-04-03T21:58Z,thank so much Narayanananda!
,m3th0d,2011-01-04T09:31Z,"Here's a tip on how to extract all files fast!
I did this:

1., Decompress the downloaded main archive to a directory
2., Use ""everything.exe"" (it's a free advanced file indexer/searcher) on the directory: search for zip files.
3., Everything.exe lists all of the archives in your main directory
4., In everything.exe select all files, then click right button -> Copy
5., Create a new directory for the archives and paste the zip files.
6., Select all zip files, in your new folder, press right button and select (with an installed WINZIP or WINRAR) Extract all.
7., Now you have decompressed the zips, and have the RAR files. You can delete the ZIP archives.
8., Select all RAR, R00, R01 files and press right button, select extract all.
9., You got them in 1 directory within 3 minutes!"
