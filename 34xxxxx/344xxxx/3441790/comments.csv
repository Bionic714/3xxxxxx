,-Frontlin_E[ph511]r-,2006-03-06T09:27Z,"So it basically consists of one of the two gay guys getting pissed at the other, they hit each, then collapse to the ground together in a sobbing heap of joy and peace.  After lovingly nibbling on each others lips, they go take turns humping each other.
Now repeat this and *bam!  There's the movie!
  ""Beautiful???""

And yeah nice scenery but what's with the aweful soundtrack!!! They just [oh so creatively] pluck at a guitar, regardless if someone's dying, shopping, or having sex!!!  I'm just glad this didn't make Oscars... even apart from the gayness, IT WAS AN AWEFUL MOVIE!"

,starwhite,2006-03-12T07:11Z,Check out doom9.net for the AC3 filter.  Its under 'Audio codecs'.  Simply dowload and install.  Voila'

I need help though. Once I download this movie, I get alot of files that I don't know what to do with.

What specifically can I do to get this movie to work?

Thanks in advance."
,z386,2006-04-26T19:39Z,"evilscottymac:
It's rar-files. You need a utility to unpack the rar's. For example Winrar.
http://www.rarlab.com/ (or search for winrar on the pirate bay...)"

,Ka_ha,2006-06-04T15:39Z,"No sound...

I have downloaded and installed a ac3 filter... Now what? Still no sound..."
,WafflesSupreme,2008-06-03T02:25Z,"Frontlin, did you watch this movie, or did you just listen to your homophobic friends rant on about this? Cause if you watched this you would have seen the unbelievable dramatic take on this film. That they had feelings, that they couldn't show them, that they were in love? I guess not, but hey, your probably a closet homosexual just trying to pass off as straight, I understand"
