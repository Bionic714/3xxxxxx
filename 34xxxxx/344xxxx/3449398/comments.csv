,kpaxDK,2006-02-26T17:32Z,hos do i use the subs?
,maelstrom,2006-02-27T07:39Z,"maybe its ok but this whole thing needs to be deleted right now, & get the dvd+r torrent version here if you want it here or don't such a newbie"
,sherman63,2006-02-27T08:47Z,"kpaxDK: Once downloaded the sub, rename it to EXACTLY the same name as the torrent, exept the ending. Instead of, for example .avi, you rename it to .srt
Put the torrent and the sub into the same folder."
,vigfus13,2006-02-27T12:35Z,"Why would you put a ""private"" flag on a piratebay .torrent?"

,Lord_Kamiizumi,2006-03-14T01:48Z,"Good movie, good torrent. Thanks!  High quality from the dmd."
,Terekmoen,2006-03-20T00:07Z,"Great quality, riped from dvd, picture is crisp, sound very good. After download you do need the program WinRAR to extract the files (simillar to WinZIP).  The movie itself is in AVI format. Everything works great! Thanks abel33."
,swana,2006-03-21T17:45Z,"Could someone tell me what I am to do with all those files from this vid? I am not familiar with the ""r"" format. Am I supposed to extract this somehow? Is there some program that will do it? Nothing i have will read any of those files. Thanks in advance. 
Swana"
,The__Dude,2006-03-23T15:05Z,If you haven't heard of the rar-format you must be a bit stupid... but if you have some skills - use winrar ;)
