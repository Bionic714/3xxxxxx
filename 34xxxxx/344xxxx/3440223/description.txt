Enclosed are 2 "episodes" of ESPN's EA Sports NFL Matchup Show. The X's and O's show for hard-core NFL fans, hosted by Sal Paolantonio with analysis from Ron Jaworski and Merril Hoge.

The first episode is the Super Bowl edition, breaking down the X's and O's of the Super Bowl matchup between the Pittsburgh Steelers and Seattle Seahawks.

The second episode is from a month ago, breaking down the matchups of Week 17.  It is by far the best episode this whole season.  I learned a TON watching that show.

If you're a NFL fan outside of America and havent seen this before, I HIGHLY recommend checking this out.  Download now and thank me later! :)


P.S. There'll be a post-Super Bowl recap episode next week.
