Det handlar om att börja med en djur och hjälpa den att överleva."

 Right-click on the EXE file and check ""Windows 95 compatibility mode"" and ""Set resolution to 256 colors"" for the game to work.  "

,ellisdee703,2008-01-27T08:03Z,"I'm having the same problem as furianx. I set the compatibility, 256 colors, ran the .reg file, and it still won't work. After doing so, it crashes once the world map loads (maybe 2 seconds later), as opposed to instantly after hitting Start.

I attempted to download the 1.2 patch, (someone mentioned autoevo.exe and this patch includes it) but now it requires the cd-rom to play. 

I'm dieing to play this game, but I'm baffled as to how to get it running. I'm running windows XP without any updates. I'm not one of those idiots that posts comments on every torrent begging someone to help them figure out how to extract the zip file. I'm fairly computer literate, and this is actually the first time I've been unable to resolve the issue on my own. "

,suicidekings,2009-11-29T18:18Z,Missing a file?....Not Complete!...IDK :P
,person117,2010-07-06T01:02Z,if ur having trouble with crashing right when you start the game make sure your running in windows 95 and 256 colors also go into the evolution folder and click setup thats how i got mine 2 work
,dudeawsome,2010-11-14T08:11Z,what do i gotta click to download
,dudeawsome,2010-11-17T09:52Z,yes i have finally got it but whenever i start you can hear the amphibians but it always crashes pops up with don t send
,jp_linder,2010-11-29T06:15Z,"I have this game right now i love it, and still play it to this day, I have an iso. file and i mount with deamon tools and play. as long as i have it mounted it plays with out a crack on my windows xp system. i tried to upload but it just loads and loads and it never goes through..... Enyone who plays spore would love this game.. same concept but in my view better. definately a unique game!"
,grasman,2012-05-06T23:32Z,"I had the same problem as ellisdee703 and others. Here's what I did to solve it. I'm running Windows 7 64 bit.

1) Make a VirtualPC and install Windows XP (32 bit) SP2 on it.
2) Copy the (extracted) evolution files to it.
3) Selected windows 95 compatibility mode and 256 colors for the game's .exe, but it crashed right after starting a new game, like it did for ellisdee703.
4) Downloaded and applied the 1.2 patch.
5) Tried it, but now it asked for a CD.
6) Took the extracted & patched files, and made a .iso out of them (making sure the files are right under the root of the CD).
7) Mounted that image on VirtualCloneDrive on the host (Windows 7), then in VirtualPC selected to use the virtually cloned drive.
8) Tried it again, now it ran but still crashed after starting a new game. Started to despair a little. 
9) Realized I had forgotten to add the keys to the registry (evol.reg)! Did that.
10) Now it works fine."
,Meeny,2012-08-26T18:41Z,"Just a heads up: This seems to be just the demo, I didn't have nearly enough trouble to get the retail version to rather than this demo. I would upp the full version myself, but I only have the german edition of this gem."
,Meeny,2012-08-26T19:20Z,"Disregard the previous comment, judging from the filesize, it's probably the full version.
However: I have found a fix for those who have trouble getting it to run under Vista or Win 7!
If you get a MEM_BAD_POINTER error when starting, you just have to replace the sh33w32.dll file in the directory with the updated version. You can just google for the filename. Any file you find is probably the updated version. 
Just replace it with the same file in the game directory. 
I then got it to run just using win95 compatibility mode and running as admin. Enjoy!"
