,NisseP,2006-11-25T09:52Z,"Help to seed when you are done downloading. I have already uploaded over 16 gigs and i have no intention staying up here forever with this torrent. I see someone has 97 % so i really hope that one will stay up and seed for a while..
If i see that that person shuts down, i will also shut down and let you download from each other until you have reach a higher %. 

So help to seed now and don't restrict the uploading. YOu have to help too."
,NisseP,2006-11-25T22:22Z,"Now i think this Danish guy has gotten it all, so i am quitting to upload anymore. I have uploaded a lot now - about 19 gigs and now it is your turn to share."
