This is the entire discography of the now disbanded Apocalypse Hoboken. They emerged in the late 80s, put out a majority of their work in the 90s and finally disbanded in the early 2000s. They managed to score a good amount of fans, especially locally, but for the most part remained on the outskirts of popularity.

This includes basically anything a person can get related to this band. All of their main albums are here (including a reissue with different tracks). Their EPs are here. I even have included the 4CD DIY Box Set that was sold at their last show; only 200 or so were made and they go for a good amount of money on eBay lately. This boxset includes some of their harder to find releases as well as live cuts, radio appearances and demos.
