Galaxies 
Galaxies was the original soundtrack to an internationally syndicated planetarium show produced by Timothy Ferris to accompany his best-selling book of the same name. Kevin Braheny's music perfectly complemented the project with a group of floating and flying pieces that captured the sense of weightlessness and cosmic grandeur of the subject.

The vistas of outer space, sonically evoked and evocative - vast, majestic, at once awesome and beckoning, otherworldly yet strangely familiar.
Travel through musical starfields. Experience the Milky Way rising over the horizon of an alien world. Look back in time brought present by the ancient light of the eldest stars, eternal witnesses to all the happenings of time and space. And experience the emotions of the traveller. Exhilaration. Awe. Poignant nostalgia, both for home and for unimaginable vistas never to be seen again save in imagination. And a jazzy, joyful return at journey's end.
