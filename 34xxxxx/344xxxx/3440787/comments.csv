it's Rmvb, but you can get a free converter prog and make them avi or whatever you want before burning to DVD"
,ZenRhino,2008-09-14T00:55Z,"oh, while I'm here... any clue where the rest of the episodes are? amazon has 5 volumes, but only the first 3 have episode listings. didn't the original tv series run have 2 seasons and over 50 episodes? sorry for not taking the time to research this better, but I figured that any talk on the subject has to have some good come from it, right?

There were only 52 episodes in 1 season of the original Speed Racer."
