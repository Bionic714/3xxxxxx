This contains nearly all songs ever made by Marilyn Manson, except a few interviews and maybe some rare songs that you could only find in special places (Brian Warners recording studio (?) ) ;)

I apologize for the last Torrent with Manson I put up, something went terribly wrong with that one. The same mistake will not happen again :) 

And remember, if you download you should at least seed for a day or two so others gets what they want to ;) 

Enjoy!
