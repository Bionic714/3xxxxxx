,Tourniquest,2006-02-04T19:55Z,"What does ""beautifully done rip"" mean? How did you rip it? Has it been compressed? If so, how much and using which program? Please give more info."
,speakeasy,2006-02-04T21:12Z,"Thank you.
A shame that the first comment was written in such a critical tone :-/
@Tourniquest - we want to encourage more people to be doing this stuff.  You feedback's not wrong, but it could have been put more . . . diplomatically."
,Tourniquest,2006-02-04T22:18Z,"Well, I can't very well know if I want to encourage it if I don't know what it is, can I? And I said please..."
,urbanriot,2006-02-05T08:05Z,Is this PAL or NTSC?
,Tourniquest,2006-02-05T13:05Z,"I downloaded a fragment of it to look at the quality, and from what I can see it looks good. No macro-blocks. I'll be happy to download the rest of it. Thank you, derek985. I've been wanting this one."
,derek985,2006-02-05T22:57Z,"Format is NTSC 16x9 720x576 (movie is 2.35:1 AR). It was ripped/compressed 20% with AnyDVD & CloneDVD to fit on a standard DVD5 disc. It includes all menus, all english dolby audio streams, all, english subtitles, and all extras. After ripping I watched the entire movie & there were no quality or sound issues."

,tg0tj,2010-01-13T21:48Z,"ok, i had a problem with this.  

I don't know ho to go about making a DVD out of this, so I notmally just find the individual files for the movie and watch them in VLC player, one by one.  But when I do this, the second 2 files of the main movie - VTS_05_3 and VTS_05_4 - play with the voice over on them.  I can't figure out how to stop this.

How should I get round this?

Great movie so far..."
,tg0tj,2010-01-13T22:04Z,"ok... i found an answer.  in vlc player, go to audio, change audio track, and select track 2..."
,noname_noproblem,2010-02-21T13:17Z,Thank you!
