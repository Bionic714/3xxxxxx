Terry, of course, is one of the writers who has penned a story for this amazing volume. To give you a brief 
glimpse into Indomitable itself, Terry wrote this to the website on December 25th, 2002: 
"I have finished the long short story that will appear in Legends II. The title is Indomitable. 
The characters are from The Wishsong of Shannara. You can probably figure out the rest by yourself, but I should warn
 you that the story doesn't play out the way you might think. Also, all this is subject to editor revision."
