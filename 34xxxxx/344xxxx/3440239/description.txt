Cairo's second CD Conflict And Dreams furthers the San Francisco band's foray into the world of orchestral and progressive rock. Driven by virtuoso musicianship and conceptual songs, Cairo's lush arrangements, soaring melodies and sweet harmonies are as cinematic as they are evocative.
Conflict And Dreams is a musical feast for lovers of bands such as Yes, Genesis and ELP.
