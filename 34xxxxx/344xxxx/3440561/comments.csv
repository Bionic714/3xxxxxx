,andba836,2006-02-06T19:11Z,"Not that many sudoku computer games around...but among the ones iv'e tried this is most probably the worst. Graphics suck and the inteface is none too good either...try sudoku quest instead...

Thx for the upload none the less!"
,Ayeron,2006-02-07T02:58Z,"""Graphics suck and the inteface is none too good either"" Sounds like your telling me how I feel about CS :o)

But lots of people like these kinda games even if it look bad. It's not about the graphics in this game, it's about puzzles ;o)
