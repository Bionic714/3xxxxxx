A high-quality version of the same video released
"as soon as possible" to Gorillaz fans following their
live performance at the 2006 Grammy Awards.

The quality of this video surpasses that of the
original release, but it comes with a heavy file
size:  Nearly 150MB for 7 minutes of video!

SOUND ISSUE HAS BEEN FIXED!  AUDIO IS NOW
PERFECTLY IN SYNC WITH THE VIDEO!

This is all-in-all, the best quality video you'll
