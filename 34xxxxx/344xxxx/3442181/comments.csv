,PHINKS,2006-02-09T06:51Z,THIS IS FREAKING AWSOME.. didn't want to watch the whole grammy's just to see a performance from the Gorillaz. Project Black is the sh!t they know what Gorillaz fans wants!!!
,crownofglory,2006-02-09T09:40Z,"Wow, this is just Fantastic, Thank you veryvery much ProjectBlack."
,ProjectBlack,2006-02-10T06:54Z,"My site actually went down because so many people tried to access the video hosted there!  I rushed immediately after the performance so that I could be the first person with it... and well, Gorillaz fans found it... and fast.

Would love to see you fellas make an appearance at ProjectBlack.com... :)"
