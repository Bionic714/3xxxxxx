iNTENSiON released this on 02/22/01 as retail, but was useless since the 
  dongle protecion was not removed : If you try to Encode with it you will 
  get a "Parallel port" error.
  
  
  SurCode DVD Pro DTS Encoder converts your 5.1 Surround Sound files to DTS 
  format, for use in DVD Video or for making Surround Sound audio CDs.
  With over 60 audio equipment manufacturers now licensed to produce DTS 
  decoders, DTS has become a standard for Surround Sound in home theater 
  systems. This makes it possible to offer your audience DTS-quality sound on 
  your DVD-Video products.
  
  SurCode DVD Professional can also encode 5.1 Surround for audio CDs, just 
  like SurCode CD Professional.



SORRY GUYS - I THINK THE OTHER ONE I UPLOADED DOESN'T WORK PROPERLY, I'VE REINSTALLED THIS VERSION ON MY PC AND IT DEFINITELY WORKS!!
