Easy FlashMaker" is a tool to create simple Macromedia Flash Movies (SWF files) quickly and easily (click to see samples). It is well known that Flash creation using professional software is very difficult process for beginners and even for more experienced users. We have tried to make this process as simple and convenient as possible.

The way to create animated SWF file using "Easy FlashMaker" is very simple:
1) Add an object (rectangle, circle, text, picture etc.) to the first frame (or to any other starting frame) and set the appropriate properties for it (position, colors, transparency etc.).
2) Go to the last frame (or to any other finishing frame) and change the properties related to this object (position, colors, transparency etc.).
All of the intermediate frames will be automatically recalculated to get animation effect (including position, color transition, transparency etc.).
3) Test the movie.
You can also edit each frame manually, if need it.

That's all. Not too difficult, isn't it?
