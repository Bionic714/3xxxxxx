,Langerz,2007-02-21T20:54Z,"Please seed asap, last time I checked 9 Leechers all have 94.3% complete, I promise that when I become seeder, I'll make sure those 9 complete the file."
,Langerz,2007-02-23T11:06Z,"DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!!!

No ""SEEDERS"" have been active for a few days. If u donwload u will get to 94.3% then it will stop, unless some1 seeds (which hasn't been the case).

Download instead from:

I will make sure my share ratio for that will be 3.0, to show others, what seeding actually means.

No sharing over 1.0, No files, simple."
