hey - whats up.
I have been bored over the weekend and decided to answer Ricky Gervais' call for a dance remix of Karls comments on podcast number 3.  Ok so it was ages ago - and I have been busy - so gimme a break.   :p

So I just spent half an hour this morning rearranging it and am happier with it.... well ..  I had nothing better to do.... oh wait I have an idea.... 

If you have not been listening to the Ricky Gervais podcast (or how I call it Karl and friends) then I highly recommend it.  It is very very funny.
