,mistermats,2006-02-11T00:45Z,Tried burning the iso onto a dvdr. Didnt work in my dvd player but of course on pc (since its just a wmv file). How do i burn the whole movie onto one dvdr? Or split it to two so I can play them on my dvd player? Cheers...
,Eigyr,2006-02-11T21:33Z,dvd shrink..
,uziwork,2006-02-12T11:02Z,"buy a Kiss DP-600 like i have. it plays all formats
from your hard disk or dvd-rom
with superior quality"
,mistermats,2006-02-12T12:07Z,"dvd shrink doesnt work...its not not ""normal"" dvd format. vmw files..."
,pr0f0und,2006-02-12T21:29Z,has anyone successfully gotten this to play in HD mode? Thats why they are wmv right? Play on a PC with media center 9 and line out to a hi-definition tv will get you true HD. I believe this is one of the only HD movies around.
,mistermats,2006-02-21T21:08Z,I'd like to know the same thing. Or a tip how you can make into a iso or equivalent. Thank you...

,lewtang,2006-02-27T01:15Z,dont bother 
,i5xswipe,2006-03-01T10:40Z,"Would be nice if this was in the standardard format to burn to a DVD-5 that's playable in your typical dvd player.  Involves a lengthy process.  Nero is best to do this.  Mount the images and extract them, then create a dvd-5 disc and nero will convert them to the right format and compress them to fit."
,lewtang,2006-03-06T00:31Z,except the second disk wont extract without and error
