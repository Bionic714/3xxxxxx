,astaldo,2006-02-06T00:29Z,"Krutan do your homework before complaining

You can apply for a beta account direct at Codemasters and some people don't want to become members of fileplanet just to try a game. I Guess that's why eXp2k made this torrent.


Note: you don't have to become a paying Fileplanet member to DL the D&D beta client from them"
,Dead-Inside,2006-02-06T16:01Z,"No you don't need to be a Fileplanet subscriber, you only need to register for the beta at www.ddo-europe.com (Obviously I don't care about the US) and get picked for the Beta. I did get picked, though I haven't really started the game yet."
[V],Zirex,2006-02-06T18:19Z,Becouse there are 1h waitingtime to begin to download the file from slowplanet. So figure it yourself out why it is put up here.
