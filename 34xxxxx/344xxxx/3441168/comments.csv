[T],GWpirateGW,2008-12-20T16:20Z,"HELP FOR TPB NOOBS.

Ok, this is rar file that has an ISO file inside.

1. Right click on the rar. Extract to folder with same name(need winrar-free to dl)
2. get a ISO Burner(http://www.ntfs.com/iso_burner_free.htm)

3. Simply open Iso Burner, look in proper folder & you will see the ISO image. Burn at slower speeds for better results, as higher speeds tend to foobar iso formats.  

With ISO, you will need that disc in order to play the game.  Happy gaming

,XV087AA,2010-06-12T18:11Z,"God, what's with the touchy people

Of course there's a Trojan, there are Trojans in all iso files, it's the way to get around the CD requirement.

And those with anti-virus software not showing anything seriously need to revise what they're using"
,Scott10,2010-08-28T15:23Z,"Hi guys, I installed the game, even updating it will all the patches. But it is asking me for a disc!

I would normally mount the image, that didn't work. I tried burning the disc, it didn't work as well. Is crack needed to play? If yes, where can I get them?

I am using Windows 7. Is there some kind of virtual drive detection here? 

For all you trolls; I'm not an idiot. I used both methods suggested and they failed."
,Scott10,2010-08-28T15:24Z,"Help needed; SOS! :(

Game keep asking me for disc/wrong disc. "
,jesusismyairbag,2011-01-24T12:33Z,thanks for this. i got it working eventually. just download the crack from gamecopyworld.
,leecox1000,2011-08-14T17:57Z,For those who get no disk error just keep the iso image mounted no need for crack file and make sure you follow the read me from the unpacked rar file:)
,xaris_sexy,2011-10-24T18:43Z,i dont play this
,grahamr93,2011-12-19T14:49Z,"To play, just download PowerISO (you can find it on here) and install it.  Open up the program, set the virtual drives to 1, then mount the iso (or whatever file type it is) and you can install the game.  It asks you to insert a disk because you haven't mounted the file, that's it.  Enjoy!"
,crung2010,2012-02-04T20:28Z,there is definitely a trojan hidden in the picture updating software. its not part of a crack or anything like that i am not a noob. its an infected file.
