Frank is one half of the awesome Rainbow Serpent. Here we have his 
first solo album and as with Gerd Wienekamp s (the other half of 
Rainbow Serpent) album  Kontakt what we get is a mixture of very 
recognisable Serpent characteristics as well as a different angle 
identifying the individuality of each member.

This is something of a concept album following the passage of a series 
of dreams. Cosmic shimmers act as a gentle introduction to  Traum 
1 but then a great whoosh of sound descends on us like a tidal 
wave. A gorgeous shimmering lead line then grabs the focus and a 
bass beat forms a solid structure on which a sequence starts to 
emerge and another brighter rhythm is layered over the top. An 
energetic driving number providing a splendid start. Each track runs 
into each other so we move straight into  Traum 2 a very melodic 
piano lead piece.  Traum 3 is a marked contrast to the previous 
number as we are immediately treated to dark synth drones. A 
delicate echoing motif is repeated and each time left to hang in the air 
until it fades away. A sequence emerges out of the dark but just acts 
as the backbone to a rather sleepy but hypnotic section. It is only 
after seven minutes that things start to take off and we get more 
umph!  Traum 4 introduces a superb heavy rhythm over which 
floats a sublime melody. For the final minute and a bit we return to 
the world of shifting images.

 Traum 5 uses a faintly tribal rhythm, flute and didgeridoo. The didg 
is an instrument I don t usually like on New Age Synth (EM) albums but 
here it fits perfectly. At two minutes the rhythm becomes rather 
manic then fades back again to allow Gothic chants to be heard, it all 
works superbly. I know some of you will be put off by the description 
of this track, don t be it is extremely inventive, effective and not 
remotely cliched. We then return to the watery shifting thoughts of 
background sleep.  Traum 6 retains the flute sound from before 
but then a sequence takes its first descriptively mellow steps. Another 
higher register one is layered over the top then more and more until I 
lose count of all the different lines involved. Superb stuff! More cosmic 
bleeps and twitters take us into  Traum 7 . From atmospheric 
beginnings a bass (non dance) rhythm very slowly unfolds then we 
get a steam train making its stately progress down the line. More 
atmospheric pads are used as the backdrop to a melodic sequence. 
This is a beautiful track and for me is the standout number on the 
album. We flow from one stunning melodic sequence to the next and 
the underpinning pads are just heavenly. Now on to the final Traum. 
The sequences are now menacing but are added to by a more playful 
one at around the four minute mark. We are dreaming again but this 
seems like a disturbed and unsettled sleep from which we will be 
pleased to wake.

So to sum up this album has sequences a plenty but don t expect 
them to be of the thunderous earthquake or a million mile an hour 
variety. What you have here is quite an emotional album but in the 
best sense and not remotely twee.
