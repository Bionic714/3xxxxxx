,wallace1957,2006-02-06T19:41Z,"it is now Monday 12:40 P.M. in Oklahoma. i will leave this torrent running but it is possible that the tracker could cut me off for reasons that i dont know and i will be at work until 11:00 P.M. Oklahoma time. i have lost my connection two times this morning but dont fear, i will seed until everyone gets this and it could take along time. rick"
,wallace1957,2006-02-07T19:02Z,"i think that dvd #3 will show a young Merle Haggard and a young Waylon Jennings. There are also other great Country Artist coming!! I will wait a while before I upload this next DVD to make sure everyone has downloaded #2. thanks, Rick"
