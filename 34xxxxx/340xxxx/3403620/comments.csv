,._.,2006-09-14T11:12Z,"People with request code problems, the solution is easy. Do NOT copy-paste it, WRITE IT DOWN as it says in the .txt and then type it in manually when asked (the auth this time). 

Worked for me."
,Kankuran,2006-09-22T11:21Z,"""People with request code problems, the solution is easy.""
As long as you type the code manually WITHOUT holding down SHIFT. That seems to work fine. No copy and paste.  "
,noone123,2006-10-06T01:33Z,"I've found that my issue is with my computer - not the program.  I get an unknown error upon installation, I believe it's an error code 1722...  I'm going to look for a fix on the autodesk site.  The installation worked on my laptop that was recently reformatted...  so everything works - it's just a machine issue for me."
