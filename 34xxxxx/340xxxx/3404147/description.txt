http://www.dodosim.com/rs206feat.html

The programming is taken from the task trainer designed to train real world pilots when converting from piston to turbine helicopters and is the most accurate representation of the Bell 206b Jetranger available. 

Some features:
* Revolutionary start system
* Hotstart Engine meltdown
* 4 custom panels
* Custom sound suite
* 3 variants (Standard 206b, No doors, TV camera chopper)


Happy hovering,
