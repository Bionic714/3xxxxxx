,small_guy,2006-02-26T00:09Z,"Can someone please help me.  I am trying to follow these instructions:

1. Install the game - Full Installation. 
2. Apply the official Civilization 4 v1.52 Patch. 
3. Replace the original CIVILIZATION4.EXE file with the one from the File Archive. 

After I extract the ccd-civ4.rar file I do not know what to do next with the files that are created, hence I cannot get past the fist step-

1. ccd-civ4.sfv
2. CIVILIZATION4.mdf
3. CIVILIZATION4.mds

I do not know how or what to do with files that end with .sfv, .mdf, .mds.

Can someone please help me?."

Download Alcohol 120%, fire it up, then copy the .mds file to an .iso or .nrg file. Then, use deamon tools an ""mount"" the image file (the .iso / .nrg ) btw You can also mount the mds file if its recognized by the mounting prgram, at least it worked for me on the CSI game...hehe"
