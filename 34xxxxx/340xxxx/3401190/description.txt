Apple changed some stuff on their Trailers Site and QT Browser stopped working.
With this QuickFix the Quicktime Browser will play Trailer again.
As of yet, this is unofficial, but iÂ´m sure there will be a newer QTBrowser posted
on XBMCScripts soon.

Copy this over the old file in the root of your Scripts folder.
THX to bULLdOG64 from XBMC Forums for sorting that out ;-)
