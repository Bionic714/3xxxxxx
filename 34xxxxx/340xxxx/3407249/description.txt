Pentangle - Sweet Child (1968)
                        
AMG EXPERT REVIEW: This album, released in 1968, at the peak
of the Pentangle's career, is probably the most
representative of their work. A sprawling two-record set,
half recorded in the studio and half live at the Royal
Festival Hall, showcases just how versatile the Pentangle
were in their unique brand of English folk, jazz, Celtic,
blues, and pop styles. Some of the live covers are easily
their finest performances. Furry Lewis' "Turn Your Money
Green," sung by the delightful Jacqui McShee, swings sweetly,
buttressed of course by Renbourn and Jansch's guitar
tapestry. Charlie Mingus' "Haitian Flight Song" features a
great solo by bassist Danny Thompson, who was easily one of
the finest musicians to grace the instrument. The studio
tracks are uniformly excellent as well, especially "The Time
Has Come," which turns waltz time inside out. McShee,
Renbourn, and Jansch all turn in career performances on this
track. But these examples merely scratch the surface of the
Pentangle's peak. An awesome and delightful collection, and
probably their finest hour. ? Matthew Greenwald
