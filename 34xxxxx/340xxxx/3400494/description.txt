HermetoÂ´s -92 record is a marvel! 
Like "mundo verde esperanca" (sometimes dated to -89) this record draws influences from jazz, classical music and various south american styles.
The result is hard to define... fusion or avantgarde, who knows?
Extremely well arranged, cerebral music for the advanced listeners!
