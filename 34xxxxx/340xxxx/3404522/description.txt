X3: Reunion 

X続: REUNION utilises a new generation game engine, developed to immerse the player into the most realistic, living universe, ever experienced. Extensive development has gone into the X続 engine, making full use of DirectX 9 technology, to create dramatic visual effects and stunningly realistic starships. The economy model in X続: REUNION is more complex than any previous X game. Coupled with the massively enhanced A.L. (Artificial Life) system, X続: REUNION will present players with an ever changing, evolving universe; where a player's actions really can shape the future of the universe.
