,operativni kadar,2006-03-16T09:33Z,"hi, 
I too can`t unpack the rar. 
The message goes:
    There is not enough space on the disk.
!   Write error: only NTFS file system supports files larger than 4 GB

I have NTFS file system and enough space as well as winrar from www.rarlab.com

Does anyone have an idea what`s going on?

Pozdrav,

Imam mali problem koji se zove ne mogu da otpaujem RAR arhivu. Iskoci poruka koja kaze da nema dovoljno mesta itd (pise gore), iako imam NTFS sistem i sta ti ja znam, dobar winrar ... Sto ce reci trebalo bi da radi ali ne radi. Ima neko ideju kako sta?"
,SicKn3sS,2006-04-02T00:40Z,Are you sure you have NTFS? Go to start -> My computer -> highlight your drive that you want to extract the file to it will say on the left if it is fat32 or NTFS. If you still cant get it to work I have no clue why there is something wrong with your drive.
,samuraimoppi,2006-04-03T13:34Z,This game should be great!

,firefoxinc,2007-05-05T11:12Z,You do not need a crack for this anymore. Go to the websight and get the 1.0 to latest patch. The removed the starforce protection and when its 2.0 or higher it does not require a cd.
