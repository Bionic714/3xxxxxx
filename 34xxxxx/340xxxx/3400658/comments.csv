After checking on my previous version, I realize that the files contained into the older DVD have an .db extension and there are 5 of them. This one, has only a bigger file (1,5 GB) with an extension of .mdf... I was wondering: is there anything else we have to do, in order to make it work??"

Is it for C or CLK class?????"
