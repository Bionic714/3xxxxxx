Level-D 767-300ER With SP21 for Flightsimulator 2004 

Have been looking for this thing a while, and all the releases i found was pretty messed up and full of junk and difficult to install right. 
So i did something about it...

If you dont get it, read below 

  4 Steps to install Level-D 767 with SP2

 1. Click 1_LDS763_Setup.exe
 2. Click 2_LDS763-Update1.exe
 3. Click 3_Create_License_Files.exe 
 4. Click 4_Level-D767SP21.exe

   Thats IT, start FS and Fly the thing...

Create_License_Files.exe is needed to create the licensefiles. Without, the plane dont load.
It puts .lic files in C:WINDOWS and C:Flight one Software
I have a Flight one Software folder in FS9 main dir as well, but that dont mean shit.. 
C:Flight one Software works for me

This is excatly how i made this thing work, if it dont work for you... Well i could probably help you but i wont!

Thats it dudes...
