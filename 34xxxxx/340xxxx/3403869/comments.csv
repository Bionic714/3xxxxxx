,mariusvisser,2008-01-27T10:37Z,"Hi. Have to ask this question here, since I'm guessing the alternative legality might be an issue. Recently noticed the ""failures"" item is greyed out in the Level-D menu. Anyone encountered this before? Something I can fix? Something to do with fsuipc? Any guesses?
Appreciated."

,RichardHighHopes,2009-03-27T23:08Z,"suomihanzu,

Maybe you were looking at the airplane when doing a replay?  I seem to recall the wheel not showing when doing a replay from the flight sim itself, but if you recorded your flight with FS Recorder http://www.fs-recorder.net/downloads.php, it will show, when you do a replay, all your wheel, rudder, aileron, etc movements (whichever ones you've checked in the setting, or preferences).  "
,RichardHighHopes,2009-03-27T23:39Z,"For others here having problems with the license for the 767, make certain your system drive is C... this is not always the case... my system drive is F, so I created a F:\Flight One Software folder and created the licence file from within, and also created the same on drive C.

,kinko182,2010-08-26T13:08Z,"For all of you who are having problems when trying to tune an ILS frecuency because it skips numbers, take a moment to read the manual!

You are trying to tune the ILS frecuency in the glass shield which is only for tuning VOR stations. (The one which is located left of the autopilot).

The proper way to tune an ILS frecuency in a 767 (as in real life), is to use the ILS (or LOC) tuner in the RADIO STACK, which is NOT the same as the VOR tuner.
