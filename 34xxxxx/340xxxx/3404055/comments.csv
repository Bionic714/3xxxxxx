This is DL to my PC on my network with lesser performance so that may have an effect on DL speeds.  Last speedtest clocked my broadband at 4.5 megabits per second. 
I am very eager to start enjoying this music that I have heard form time to time and longed to have in my library.  Since this is not a huge file I'm sure I can seed it most often and by request as well."
