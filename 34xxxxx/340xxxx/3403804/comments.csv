,pir9,2006-11-13T23:34Z,"DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME DOWNLOADING THIS! It doesnt work, not a proper rip, maybe for PC emulation use but not for use on a modded GC. STAY AWAY! you've been alerted, thats just my 50 cents.."
,pir9,2006-11-13T23:35Z,"in other words, don't waste a miniDVD on this one!"
,wail0rd,2007-04-02T18:54Z,"It does work on a chipped Wii however...

1. Download GCOS from 
http://www.wiinja.com/utils/gcoswiinjapal.rar
or 
http://www.wiinja.com/utils/gcoswiinjausa.rar

2. Burn GCOS and the game to a normal dvd.

3. Start the gcos dvd and select 'Boot DVD' from the menu.

4. Eject the gcos dvd and insert the simpsons dvd. press A.

Works on PAL wii with wiikey chip"

,icester,2008-03-08T19:54Z,"Doesn't work in Dolphin (PC emu for GC).  It works for about 1/2 second then gives ""This is not the Simpsons Hit & Run Disc ..."".  

I suspect this is someone's poor attempt to rip a GC disc without using the proper methods.  

I haven't tried it on GC - I'm not willing to lose a miniDVD over it."
,icester,2008-03-09T18:43Z,"Ok, I finally went ahead and tried it....

IT WORKS!!!

If it isn't working for you, then mostly likely it is because you have a bad burn.  The GC is EXTREMELY picky.

,foikfaftw,2010-03-11T07:59Z,"Will not run with GameCube Launcher 0.2 on Wii with any cMIOS (tried v4, v5, v8, and v10).  Goes to initial copyright notice screen before title, disc reads and reads and reads, and then a black screen with ""an error has occured"" message pops up.  Not a good rip?"
