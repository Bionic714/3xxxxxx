,suden82,2006-03-15T13:41Z,Can some one seed? Stuck on 54 %
,KIDDRELIC,2006-03-31T17:49Z,please can someone seed???? thanx
,meowing,2006-08-22T16:27Z,"Is this with special features?
And a seeder would be nice.. ;-)"
,meowing,2006-09-02T15:57Z,"Someone with a 100% seed for this? With a bit of speed also? This torrent is currently going at 0.2 kb/s.

Thanks"
,meowing,2006-09-03T16:52Z,"OK, so we're all stuck at 66.4%
Another huge bandwidth waster this has been. I'm stopping the upload for this until I see a REAL 100% seed appearing."
,meowing,2006-09-14T21:11Z,"Is there a seed for this? I haven't seen one in months, and all are going up to the two who are at 92% and 98%. None will finish if there's no full seed."
,meowing,2006-09-21T20:06Z,In about a week we are all at 92% without 1 seed. What a waste of bandwidth..
,meowing,2006-10-02T20:38Z,"hey 108-moc-4, thanks for your seed!"
,meowing,2006-10-10T00:24Z,"OK, this is going to take forever. We're now all at 95.4% and no seed in view :-("
,meowing,2006-10-11T03:03Z,"So, of all 160 people that downloaded this, not one is able to seed for a moment, WTF?"
,meowing,2006-10-19T14:10Z,"We're only 150 MB away from having 20 seeds in the swarm, if only the one seed would share those 150 MB."
,meowing,2006-10-22T17:53Z,Hello? Where has every seeder gone? We're all at 96.2%
,meowing,2006-11-25T01:06Z,"It says ""1 seeder"", but trust me: There isn't one.

The only one that was here was Polish, but it left the swarm months ago.

Any other seed around? We're all only 100 MB away from 100%.

P L E A S E:  S E E D  N E E D E D !"
,meowing,2006-11-30T16:00Z,"OK, I will give it another week, and then I'm dropping the 7 Gigs from my HD.
Pity."
,meowing,2006-12-17T02:44Z,"Nice, 160 seeds out there, but none was friendly enough to share the last 150 Megs. This torrent is now officially dead. Assholes."
