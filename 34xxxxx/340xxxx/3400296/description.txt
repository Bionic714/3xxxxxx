This is:

All 14 eps (that I know of) from the short lived Battletech cartton series.
Also included is a short live action film called 'Combatant'.
Video Quality - fair, most likely a VHS rip
Audio - Spoken english


Notes:

1) This is my first torrent, so if I stuffed up inform me in a constructive manner for a desirable result. If I get to much greif I will just kill it and walk away, that simple.

2) I don't personally know of any sites that have information about this series except for the IMDB link listed above.

3) As of 01 Nov '05 I will be relocating so will be off line for 3 weeks. That gives someone (or more) people 8-9 days to complete and seed. Once I return I will reseed.

4) Except for the above I AM SEEDING, either the stats are wrong OR I am at my bandwidth limit.

Otherwise hope it works, and enjoy.
And remember, seeding AFTER completion is more important than how much you shared before completion.
