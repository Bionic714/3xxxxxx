,boxhead21,2008-09-13T08:33Z,THE LAST EPISODE 14 IS A REPEAT OF 13 AND IS NOT 2 PART JUST REPEAT. I REMEMBER THE LAST EPISODE BACK 12 YRS AGO AND I KNOW THIS IS NOT THE LAST EPISODE. STILL MISSING EPISODE 14! PLZ LET ME KNOW WHERE DID YOU GET THE VID FROM 
,GKraften,2009-02-12T04:38Z,"Just DL'ed this... The vid qual is acceptable-ish (but pretty lo-res), but the sound is really, really low, canny and distorted on most episodes (#1 is a lot better), but not by any means unintelligible. All in all viewable, but that's about it.

That being said, I haven't found this anywhere else, online or offline, DL or buy, so if you want it, this is the only way to go as far as I know (a correction on this point would be very welcome).

So thanks a bunch for the UL, I've been wanting to get my hands on this for years. Screw the crappy qual; nostalgia shall pave my way! :)"
,aradiel,2011-01-02T19:06Z,"These were capped from Australian TV using analogue video capture. Two of the episodes are the same, the last two. The confusion is because there were two versions of the series, and the episodes had different titles in each version. Also, there is one episode missing, a clip show, that was never shown on Australian TV.

You can find the whole series, minus the clip show, and in slightly different quality from: http://www.sarna.net/files/index.php/media/video/tv/"
