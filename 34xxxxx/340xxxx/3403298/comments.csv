,unsol,2006-01-26T01:20Z,"Might be that dumb mpeg-2 encoding...  Use VLC media player. Seems to play just about everything fairly well (google VLC, it's the first hit... bye videolan)"

,maverick1221,2007-06-17T21:53Z,How come I download videos and only get video but no audio
,Coacervo,2007-06-21T21:51Z,"Haven't downloaded this, but you can get a program like Video Inspector (think I got mine from CNet's download com) and use that to find out what video and audio codecs the movie is recorded in.  I bet you will find the audio is in something like Dolby's AC3, which is not natively supported by Windows, and you will need to download and install the missing codec.  Free-codecs com is an excellent place to get missing codecs."
