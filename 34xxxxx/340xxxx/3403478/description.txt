-TAGLINE-
	"A new breed of enemy has taken over the world...
	Sam Hell has come to take it back." (the world or the enemy?)

-WHAT THE BACK OF THE CASE SAYS-
	"The recent nuclear apocalypse has drastically reduced the male population and made most humans sterile. Spangle sends Sam Hell into Frogland, the mutant wasteland, to impregnate as many fertile women as he can. Once there, he learns that the mutant mayor, Toty, has kid-napped eight human women for his harem. Now Hell's mission is to rescue Spangle and the harem from this supreme mutant...the ambassador of death."

-WHAT REALLY HAPPENS-
	It's been a while since I've seen it, but that seems pretty accurate. And that last line after the "..." sure is pretty awesome.

-Notes-
My first official DVDRip release! Don't let that fool you into thinking its good quality though! I got this DVD for free, and its the unauthorized release and looks as if it was transfered from a VHS copy. Ha! It's still MUCH better quality than my normal releases. If you like this film, I suggest you get yourself the good DVD with the original aspect ratio and commentary, it's like five bicks.

I haven't actually seen this movie for about 3 years, but its stuck in my head that whole time, so that's sure to attest it's quality! One year before Rowdy broke out in the amazing THEY LIVE!, there was HELL COMES TO FROGTOWN. Roddy battles mutants in a post-apocalyptic wasteland while at the same time trying to fend off legions of horny women (You ask 'why' now, but you won't after you see the main girl). There's frog-punching, car chases, wrestling and if I remember correctly a great 'Jabba's palace' scene. Enjoy!

*QUESTIONS*
Why is the resolution so small?
...That's as high as my capture card will go. Sorry, I'm cheap.

The video and/or audio sucks!
...Well its captured off an amazingly old VHS.

That movie was horrible!
...That's the point.
