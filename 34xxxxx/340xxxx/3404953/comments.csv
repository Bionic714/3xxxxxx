,gazgull,2010-08-07T11:56Z,"Vlad was good at what he did and a mad man at the same time. Who in the hell would be willing too attack is castle knowing the fact the he impaled his victom's on a pike, sure as hell not i that is for sure."
,TheAbstruseOne,2011-03-14T03:08Z,"He saved his country from an evil empire who repeatedly tried to invade his homeland, taking extreme measures to protect his country.  For this, many people of his country still revere him as a national hero even though most of the rest of the world thinks of him as a monster who tortured and murdered untold numbers.

Now, am I talking about Vlad III (aka Vlad Drakula, he wasn't called Vlad Tepes or Vlad the Impaler until after his death) or USSR leader during WWII Joseph Stalin?  One repelled the Ottoman Empire, one repelled the Nazi Germans.

Sorry, but when the only true historical fact widely known about your country's hero is that he figured out a way to shove a sharpened stick through people so that they didn't die for three friggin' days, he's probably going to be remembered as a monster regardless of what book someone very loosely bases on him 400 years later."
