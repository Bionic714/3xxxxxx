=======================================================================
RainbowCrack is a general propose implementation of Philippe Oechslin's 
faster time-memory trade-off technique. In short, the RainbowCrack tool 
is a hash cracker. A traditional brute force cracker try all possible 
plaintexts one by one in cracking time. It is time consuming to break 
complex password in this way. The idea of time-memory trade-off is to 
do all cracking time computation in advance and store the result in 
files so called "rainbow table". It does take a long time to precompute 
the tables. But once the one time precomputation is finished, a time-
memory trade-off cracker can be hundreds of times faster than a brute 
force cracker, with the help of precomputed tables.

FastLM tables are an improvement on the original type of LM tables -->

=======================================================================
A new type of Rainbow Tables has been added to Winrtgen v1.3. "FastLM" 
tables can be used against LM Hashes and provide both faster generation 
and cryptanalysis. FastLM tables are not compatible with standard 
tables for LM Hashes generated by RainbowCrack, renaming the filenames 
is useless.
=======================================================================

The full set of these "Rainbow Tables" will crack 99.99% of all alpha-
numeric (Windows NT) Lan-Manager password hashes.

Each of the tables are in separate achieves, this means that you have 
to extract each of the tables individually. The reason I did it this 
way is so that people can download only some of the tables if they so 
desire.

Success probability of cracking a alpha-numeric Lan-Manager hash:
1 Tables = 76.96%
2 Tables = 94.69%
3 Tables = 98.78%
4 Tables = 99.72%
5 Tables = 99.94%
6 Tables = 99.99%

These tables can only be used in conjunction with Cain from 
http://www.oxid.it/cain.html

To crack passwords using FastLM tables and Cain:
1. Open Cain
2. Click the "Cracker" tab
3. Select "LM & NTLM Hashes" from the list on the left
4. Add passwords to the list using the "+" button on the top toolbar
5. Select accounts to attack
6. Right click on the account/accounts and select "Cryptanalysis Attack 
(FastLM)"
7. Press "Add Table" and select the rainbow tables
8. Press "Start"

The tables are suitably sized to fit onto a DVD for portability. The 
tables can be used directly from the DVD.

The tool used to generate these tables - Winrtgen, is included with 
Cain.
