Abstract of a brochure:

ChemDraw Ultra
adds StructName, ChemDraw/
Excel, ChemNMR, CLogP, tPSA and ChemFinder/Word to
ChemDraw Pro. With rich polymer notation, atom numbering,
BioArt templates, and modern user interface, ChemDraw is
more powerful than ever before. Create tables of structures,
identify and label stereochemistry, estimate NMR spectra
from a ChemDraw structure with structure-to-spectrum
correlation, obtain structures from chemical names, assign
names from structures, and create multi-page documents
and posters.

ChemDraw/Excel
allows the user to create chemically
knowledgeable spreadsheets within the familiar Microsoft
Excel environment. You can build and manipulate chemical
structures within Excel, compute chemical properties and
perform database searches.

Chem3D Ultra
includes a number of molecular modeling
capabilities such as molecular overlay, conformational searching
and dihedral driver support. It also includes interfaces for
optional use of MOPAC, Gaussian and GAMESS. The user
can also compute advanced physical properties such as
CLogP and ChemProp. These properties can be used to
create SAR tables. ChemSAR/Excel can then be used to
explore structure activity relationships. High quality Chem3D
graphics can be viewed on the web using the Chem3D ActiveX.

ChemFinder
is a fast, chemically intelligent, relational
database search engine for desktop, workgroup or enterprise
applications. Extended integration with Microsoft Excel and
Word adds chemical searching and database capability to
spreadsheets and documents.
