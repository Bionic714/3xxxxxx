,hkmjar,2008-08-05T21:20Z,"SQL Server 2005 Enterprise Edition only runs on Windows Server or Datacenter versions (Windows 2000 Server, Windows 2000 Advanced Server, Windows 2003 Server, etc ... ).

For WindowsXP try SQL Server Developer or Standard Editions.

All the files in the torrent extract (with 7zip program) into a single .iso file which can be mounted with Daemon Tools or burned to a real DVD to install SQL Server Enterprise."
