Widespread Panic: July 1, 2005
Nearly 4,000 fans enjoyed a beautiful summer evening and the mesmerizing sounds from touring jam band, Widespread Panic. Here?s a sample of what our guests had to say about Brundage?s great outdoor venue:

?Please, please play here again... it has been far too long to see music in a setting such as this... the crowd was mellow, nice and the staff at Brundage was the same. It had such a positive feel. For those of you who didn't go... I highly recommend this area?wow... Thanks.?

?Great show at a sweet venue.?

?Fantastic show! And a huge thank you to the Brundage Mountain staff/employees. Y?all made it perfect!! Can't wait to get back to that incredible place!?

?The McCall show was fantastic! It doesn't get better than this. Thanks to Brundage for welcoming the HUGE party and this legendary band.?

?Thank you Panic for coming to the beautiful state of Idaho, this McCall show was an absolute throw down by the boys in one of the most beautiful venues yet. It felt like you were on top of the world with a bunch of your friends and havin' a real good time. Thanks to Brundage Mountain and McCall for making it a great night!?
