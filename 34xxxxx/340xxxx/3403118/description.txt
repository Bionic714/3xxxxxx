About The Game :

Glacier is a combat racing game that puts you behind the wheel of the Iceblade - Not just any car, the Iceblade is the ultimate combat car prototype vehicle. It's stronger than a tank, turbocharged and has over 1200 horsepower for you to (ab)use. There's an arsenal of weaponry for you available, like machine guns, missiles and mines. 

Get in the Iceblade and race your way down the mountain of death: Dodge falling rocks, survive incredible jumps, and eliminate the chasing cops in their 4WD terrain vehicles or choppers. Glacier is an adrenaline rush like you never experienced before!
