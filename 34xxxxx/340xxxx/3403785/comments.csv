,DamianHoward,2009-01-24T14:17Z,"Hi, does anyone know how to get this game working? I've read what someone's put about changing the name to .iso but it's downloaded in 25 parts or whatever so could someone help me to get it into a working stage please. I'm trying to use this on the ""Dolphin"" emulator.

Thanks.. Also, could someone post up the torrent for any of the GameCube Wrestling games please. Preferably; WWE WM XIX, WWE DOR and/or WWE DOR 2

Thanks again"
