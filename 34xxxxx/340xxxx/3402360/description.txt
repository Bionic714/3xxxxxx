Disky's Best of Canned Heat collection combines all original material taken from their most popular late- '60s Liberty albums: Boogie With Canned Heat, Future Blues, and Canned Heat. The most obvious of their well-loved hippie blues tracks are here, including "On the Road Again," "Going Up the Country," "Fried Hockey Boogie," and "Let's Work Together." If your collection is lacking a decent budget-priced Canned Heat disc, pick this one up.
