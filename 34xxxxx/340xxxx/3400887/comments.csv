,johnleo,2006-01-12T02:02Z,if i want to burn this to a dvd with english subs how do I do?
,spining norman,2006-05-12T18:11Z,Someone is making a blooody speech during film what makes it unable to watch  / :
,palfskaya,2007-08-02T10:28Z,"it's a pity indeed, what a waste, somebody is talking whole through the film, explaining everything."
,palfskaya,2007-08-02T11:29Z,"this film has two separate audio tracks, with some mediaplayers you can choose which track you want to hear. my normal media player will only play both tracks together at the same time. have to find another player."
,Malestrom,2010-06-04T04:02Z,"Would be nice to know what player to watch this on because I get only the Italian, no-subtitle version.  Nonetheless, this is probably one of the best films ever made.  Thanks Mike."
,StvnWilsn,2011-04-10T20:49Z,"i use media player classic which comes with K-Lite Codec Pack.  Its easy to switch audio tracks.

right click on media player classsic, go to Filters > Audio 
from there you can change the audio if there are multiple audios. 

To load subtitle  rename the .srt file exactly as the .avi  file.    Media Player Classic should automatically detect and show the subtitles. 

or you can manually load the subs from File > Load Subtitles   (go to the folder where your video file is)

glad to help some noobs. cheers !
