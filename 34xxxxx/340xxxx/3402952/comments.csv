,e-dry,2006-04-23T13:50Z,"hello cisP,

I also tried to download it, but the tracker gives some kind of error, do you have the same problem?I was stuck @  0.0%, did you already have a part of the file or is it also still on 0.0%?"

,trance_rulez,2006-05-03T21:25Z,"I've found this one on dc, as soon as I get it I'll share it!"
,trance_rulez,2006-05-05T17:18Z,"it was something wrong with the version i got too.. the sound was corrupt :(

i've heard that it's avaliable at www.audiofarm.cc and there's seeders too!
someone with an account there who can dl and upload it here?!"
,e-dry,2006-05-06T01:07Z,"i hope someone gets it quick, but it's kind of weird that I cannot get contact with frantic pirates, the one who placed this file..."
,trance_rulez,2006-05-11T18:12Z,This is avaliable at www.twin-torrents.com but the sounds aren't working for me when I use them in FL Studio...
,e-dry,2006-05-23T00:42Z,hm that's a shame that you cannot use them in fruity loops.I use skale tracker myself maybe it works for me?I opened the site www.twin-torrents.com but I cannot find the file there..?
