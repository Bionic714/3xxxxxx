Since the previous seeder http://thepiratebay.org/details.php?id=3396306 stopped seeding even though there's a bunch of ppl still waiting I searched and found the book on another site. Here's a new seed, hope it will work. My first torrent here >p 

Since I need my machine for other stuff than bittorrent (and it's a bit too loud to keep it running 24/7) I will only seed for a short while. Plz help seeding after you're done.
