PLOT:

Captain Spaulding, the noted explorer, returns from Africa and attends a gala party held by Mrs. Rittenhouse. A painting displayed at that party is stolen, and the Marx's help recover it. Well, maybe 'help' isn't quite the word I was looking for, this is the Marx Brothers after all...



ENJOY!
