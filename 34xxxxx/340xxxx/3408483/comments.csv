Delete the files that did not reach 100% and start up the torrent I just gave the address of.  You will have to re-download the movies that didn't reach 100% but there are seeds on this.  Good Luck"

,morten.solli,2006-08-01T15:37Z,"After app a month of uploading incomplete download to others at arround 31KB/s, useless waiting for some one to help out and making useless request for helps which has given no fruit I must sadly decide to delete this download as it does not seem that anybody will help.
I suggest you guys do the same.
Of course it's up to you. It is sad to see that no body wants to help. I must sadly say that I am very disappointed."

I wait two more days, if nobody will help (which it looks like) then I will delete this download and mark it as invalid download."
