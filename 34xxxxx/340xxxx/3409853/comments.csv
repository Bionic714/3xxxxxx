Just make sure your not using the latest firmware on the 60GB video IPOD."

,Karasuhebi,2006-04-30T09:06Z,"There's been a misunderstanding. The last 5 episodes are not from Season 5. They are actually part of season 4. They just split Season 4 into Season 4a and Season 4b. If you don't believe me, here's the proof:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Family_Guy_episodes

Also, if you go to the official FG site, familyguy.com, they have the 5 episodes listed here as from Season 5 in their Season 4 episode list.

,kazimir22,2007-06-28T00:46Z,"Well...i got it and stuck it into itunes. first of all...""a Very Special Family Guy Freakin' Christmas"" and ""8  Simple Rules for buying my Teenage Daughter"" don't copy. second of all, the season 5 stuff is actually season 4 and season 4 is not complete even then.

but it is really nice quality and there tons of episodes in this download.
totally worth it despite its faults "
,wirthith,2007-08-11T10:22Z,"okej everyone, this is every episode, but not into the fifth season... the episode  ""Brian goes back to collage"" that is the last episode in this torrent, belongs to season 4, and not the end of season 4, but in the middle ^^ i do think its strange to end the torrent in the middle of a season, but you can try get the remaining episodes from season 4 here on piratebay... check careful if it really is the season they say, use this page   http://www.tv.com/family-guy/show/348/episode_listings.html?season=5&tag=nav_bar;5"

i have all family guy episodes on my pc but converting them is a real pain - cheers to all seeders hope it'll be fast. i'll keep seeding for a good week or two.

spread the love"
,Ponis,2007-11-06T20:34Z,Hey! What program did you use to compress these files!? Can only get them as big as around 90mb but your files are around 50mb.. I want to out in all the family guy episodes that exists on my ipod;)
,AlphaOmegaaaa,2007-11-08T20:08Z,"to compress to ipod video format google videora.. its what i use and you can set quality at different levels to control the output size.

i finished this torrent and im seeding... but...

when i import them to itunes they all appear under movies and not tv shows. i like to keep my ipod organized and i cant find a way to convert them to tv-shows all at once (i only manage to do it one by one and its a pain). if anyone has a solution please post.

and thanks again for the upload. "
,RakaDisciple,2007-11-11T13:57Z,"Well If u awnt them in the tv shows catagory you can just highlight  the first one, hold shift, highlight the last one (rhis should highlighy all the videos.) Then  click ""Get Info"" under the  ""Video"" tab, click the drop down menu for ""Video Kind"" change this to t "" TV Show"", and clcik OK. This should have the desied outcome. If not then I fear there is no good way... way"
,RakaDisciple,2007-11-11T13:59Z,Srry about all  the typos but my computer is wierd and I cant even see what I;m typing right now.
