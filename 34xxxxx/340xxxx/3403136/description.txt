One of the greatest foreign language films ever made, Roberto Rossellini's "ROME, OPEN CITY" was filmed in the direct aftermath of World War II on the war-ravaged streets of Italy. Shunning Hollywood gloss and glamour, this frank tale is set against the backdrop of extreme conditions, and characterises neorealism's principal traits - natural lighting, handheld camerawork and a cast composed largely of non-actors. 

Due to the scarcities of war, scraps of film acquired from photographers had to be used, giving the film a uniquely gritty style. Now digitally restored, Rossellini's masterpiece appears as never before.

Based on real events that took place in Nazi-occupied Italy in 1944, it examines the choices that people are forced to make in wartime. Centring on the Resistance and its members, this is a tragic and emotional exploration of human spirit and the effects of war.
