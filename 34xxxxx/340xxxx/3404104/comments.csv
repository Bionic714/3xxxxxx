,mynameisunique,2008-03-16T14:11Z,"3 questions:

1st: which mac os x version are we talking about here?
2nd: what will happen once you upload the system?
3rd: I've tried a different os x hack on my laptop and when I start the system up it only shows a lite-blue screen on install. so I tried it with a external screen which worked, but after install and without the external screen it still doesn't start (same blue screen). anyone know what to do?

hardware: 

- 40GB ATA
- intel celeron M 1.4 GHz
- intel GMA915 Graphics card 
- 1GB RAM

also does any1 know if a standard install works if you build your own pc using the same CPU, GPU etc. "
,chatdeau,2008-10-12T23:17Z,"Additional information:

This seems to be Mac OS X Tiger 10.4.1 (or 10.4); can't say as I didn't install it yet and it's not written anywhere in the docs. It most probably is an early version of Tiger as if other versions didn't exist at that time, that's probably why it is not specified.

I could get the following information from the kernel the DVD boots with: 
Darwin Kernel Version 8.1.0: Thu May 26 19:14:56 PDT 2005; root:xnu-792.1.82.obj~3/RELEASE_PPC

That's quite old, but could work on older systems that there's no way to install newer versions.

This release seems to support both SSE2 and SSE3 processors.

Hope it helps someone out there !"
