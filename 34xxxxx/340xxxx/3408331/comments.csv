Seed power!"
,jompa1980,2006-03-17T15:00Z,"Can anyone please give me URL to Volume 1 please? 

And i also have trouble playing the videos in both VLC and Win Media Player. I know i have to rename them but to what and which codecs should i use?

I've tried .avi,mpeg and mpg for those that have DVD-rip in the file name and .vob for the others but it plays with errors and it skips the start of each video. Im swedish btw if anyone care to help.. i know its an old torrent but the quality of the tracks are high.

Thx in advance!"

,Lettos,2006-08-12T05:06Z,the links above arent dvd rips or vob they are crap quality...
,Yadott,2006-08-14T16:44Z,Säkert lika skit kvalitet som den 1sta packen var. Dålig kvalitet kan man gissa. Första var helt enkelt skit.
,Yadott,2006-08-14T16:46Z,"Hey...this is wasting of time, because quality is so poor that you cant use this. Volume is variable and image quality is real poor in part of avi files. The 1st packet was total garbage.

My advice: not worth to Download."
,Lettos,2006-08-15T13:55Z,"that isnt the first package.. as u see the torrent is from kriss_y and the other pack is another user, i think the first dvd music package is dead... i wanna download some MVs with dvd quality... anyone know a good site?"
,kyuuka,2006-12-12T04:58Z,erm...can someone please seed? 
,llr,2006-12-19T02:39Z,"I've been wondering for years why there aren't many mpeg2 video collections, absurd, isn't it?

,Chimairo,2006-12-20T07:34Z,"I 2 have wonderd why there aren't many DVD mpegs, M2v, Vobs etc.
