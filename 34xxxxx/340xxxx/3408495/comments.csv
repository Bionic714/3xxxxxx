,Liet727,2009-10-28T19:25Z,"My version of VLC (0.8.6h) plays it just fine, and to my knowledge no one has installed anything close to the CCCP codec on this machine.  "
,dark_globe,2010-03-11T07:06Z,"Thanks for the upload, but I just cannot for the life of me get the Kanji english subs to work. I've tried many different programs and filters, but it just does not work for me."
,killa132004,2010-04-02T22:18Z,to view this the best quality possible use CCCP(cccp-project.net/) with its internal codecs or if you have a slower PC use coreAVC from piratebay to use your graphics card(needs an nvidia 8 series or better) netbook loves it(ion based).
,Kimsin21,2011-01-24T02:47Z,can someone plz tell me how to view this in spoken English not Japanese????
