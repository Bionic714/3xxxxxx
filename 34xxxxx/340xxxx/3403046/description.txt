Description: The Devil is so unhappy with the recent victories of Heaven that his eye has swollen. In an attempt to win some ground back he decides to send Don Juan, Seducer Extraordinaire, up on earth with the mission of seducing a virgin girl. In this quasi-comedy Ingmar Bergman tells us a playful and irreverent story of how Good and Evil are both irrelevant and absurd in the face of love and true feeling.
