Variable Bit Rate MP3 - 110meg
79min 55 Secs. Will just about fit on an 80min CD!

Thought I would put a CD together with some of my fav tunes at the moment.

Mixed on two Numark TTx-1 turntables with a DJM600 mixer via TimeCoded Vinyl. Its no 'Renaissance' as I'm new to this mixing lark. Besides, if I wanted a completely seamless mix I would have done it digitally using Traxtor Studio. There are a couple of mistakes but I like to think I recovered :-)

Any feedback both good and bad would be appreciated as I'm learning!

Enjoy!
