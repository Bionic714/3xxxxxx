,BabelonKing,2008-04-17T09:33Z,"WTF! What's the problem with mounting CD1?! I can't seem to get anything working using Daemon Tools Lite. The only solution I can think of is extract the games' files from CD1, then hit the Setup button to force it to install, but then, after installing the full game, I presume the installation will ask me for disc 1. Is there a way so I can convert this to an ISO format, so it can be reconized by Daemon Tools?"
,BabelonKing,2008-04-17T10:06Z,"Here is a method I used to install the game since CD1 wasn't reconized by my Daemon Tools.

Requirement: PowerISO.

1. Extract the game files from CD1 into any directory of your choice.

2. Press the SETUP button to begin installing.

3. During installation, you'll be asked to insert Disc 2. Since the installation is in full screen, Windows users will have to hit the Windows button to access the Daemon Tools icon. Mount Disc 2 in the drive specified on your virtual drive (example: E, F, G ect).

4. Continue the same process with the other CD's until installation is complete.

5. Select Finish when done.

NOTE: The NO-CD Crack is in the DEVIANCE folder. Copy & Paste that to the games directory you installed it.

Hope that helps anyone with the same problem."
,raynesmom831,2008-07-11T06:29Z,I am naming my daughter who will be here in 7 weeks after Rayne. I was obsessed with these games on PS2

,photonarbiter,2008-09-01T06:44Z,no matter what i do with the deviance folder it says insert original disc some1 plz tell me exactly what to do!
,Panther333,2008-11-18T22:39Z,"Ok this is one easy way to do it. Use Power ISO to extract the Bin file on the 1st CD. Take the Deviance folder out and put it on your desktop or wherever. Then copy the rest of the files to a folder..CD1. (don't worry about the CAB files and don't use winrar for them.) Hit the Install.exe and it will begin installing. When it asks for disk 2 hit the Windows or (start button) and use power ISO for CD2 to extract the bin. to get the next CAB. and put it back in the CD2 folder. DO this for 3 and 4 as well.  After the game is done installing just take the Crack file from Deviance folder and put it in the Program Files, BloodRayne folder. Your Done. "
,prevalence,2008-12-26T15:58Z,"WTF i downloaded this game,and now i hawe a folder where are 4 folder whit names CD1,CD2,CD3,and CD4 and a deviance.nfo?

,aboktejebo,2009-03-09T21:34Z,"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!
I'm going mad here!!! I want to play this game so badly!!! 
I mounted the first cd with poweriso, and pressed setup and the game started to install, then it asks me for cd 2, and I tried mounting it with poweriso and daemon tools, but all it does is open a window with a rar file named data3 and when I try extracting it it says that no files were found and when I try opening it it says the file is in a unrecognizable format or it is damaged. -.-  I also tried mounting it, but it didn't do anything. I'LL DIE IF I DON'T GET TO PLAY THIS, PLEASE ANYONE?!?!?!!!!?????????

How do I fix that?"
,arkla,2009-05-28T03:46Z,"for those of you who have installed the game, but get the insert CD 1 error message-
open the CD1 folder, the place where SETUP is
find the DEViANCE folder then copy the rayne2 file into the game's main folder normally something like (c:my programmes:majesco entertainment: bloodrayne2)
then start the game up like normal"
,weaping_reaper,2009-06-09T16:35Z,"For Everyone having trouble installing, i have a solution, and a problem i need someone to help me with. the solution for installing is to do exactally what BabelonKing said, POWERISO, thats the tool that you need for this ,
