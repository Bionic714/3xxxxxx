 Cedega 5.0 Release Notes

Released November 8, 2005.


   Overview

TransGaming is pleased to announce the release of Cedega 5.0, dubbed
Cheddar, giving TransGamers access to more Windows games in Linux with
greater ease. TransGamers are able to download Cedega in RPM, Debian and
TGZ formats from the downloads section of TransGaming's website:
http://www.transgaming.com/

Cedega 5.0 is our first release to feature integration between the
Cedega GUI (formerly known as Point2Play) and the core Cedega technology
(now referred to as the Cedega engine). In addition to the usability
improvements that accompany this fusion, we also give you the ability to
play /Battlefield 2/, /Dungeon Siege II/, /City of Villains/, /Madden
NFL 2006/ and /Madden NFL 2005/ on your Linux desktop today. And since
this is Cedega 5.0, we also bring you technology advancements such as a
scheduler for 2.6 kernel users, pixel shader 1.4 support, improved
OpenGL VBO/VAR support for caching geometry on the video card, and
preliminary OpenGL FBO support for faster render-to-texture performance.
