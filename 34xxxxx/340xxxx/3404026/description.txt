This is a program much like Trillian in that it allows you to
login to multiple instant messaging protocols (Yahoo, ICQ, MSN,
AIM, IRC, and more) -  And it's completely free and has no
advertisements or spyware!  			

It's got lots of features, and it's perfect if you hate IM progs
that hog resources or show advertisements all over the place.
