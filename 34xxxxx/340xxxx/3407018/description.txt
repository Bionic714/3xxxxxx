     Releasenotes: This is a bootleg (i.e non-official CD) that was handed out
                   free at an anti-Bush demo in NYC. It contains 21 Looptroop
                   songs as far as I know and one promo-track for their latest
                   album.s

                   For those of you who are not familiar with Looptroop I can tell
                   you that they are a very political (anarchist/socialist) hip
                   hop group from Sweden. They reside on Burning Heart Records (a
                   subsidiary of Epitaph) and was the first non-punk band to be
                   signed to this lable. They have had mainstream success in
                   Sweden despite (or because of) their often controversial
                   lyrics.

                   Enjoy!
