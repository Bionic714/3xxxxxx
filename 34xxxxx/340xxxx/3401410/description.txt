      :   | Yes, we heard the same rumors going around that our     |   :
      |   | neighbors to the north got this game last night. So     |   |
      |   | why didnt we pre this last night? We dont live in       |   |
      |   | fucking igloos thats why!  Anyway, wether it was true   |   |
      |   | or not, you should not be expected to have to peruse    |   |
      |   | bittotrrent to find out that there isnt a real version  |   |
      |   | on it (thats our intern's job!).  Here is a dump from   |   |
      |   | the group you can always count on for quality. Sadly    |   |
      |   | it appears this doesnt' work with any current loader    |   |
      |   | (we owe you $5 mups!) but maybe a rip hack and slash    |   |
      |   | will make it work.  Who knows.                          |   |
