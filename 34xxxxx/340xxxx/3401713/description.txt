I just downloaded this from TorrentSpy a couple hours ago but haven't tried installing it since it doesn't contain a .nfo file.  It seems to have a install.exe for WB5 + crack.exe..which seems kinda fishy to me.  I have scanned it Nod32 Antivirus, Spyware Doctor, and Spy Sweeper.  It turned up nothing..so please people, leave feedback to whether this file is legit or not..as I have been awaiting to install WB5 myself, to get the Vista look on my system.

** Again, I haven't tried installing this file so install at your own risk!!!  I will not be responsible for your ignorance+stupidity of not reading what I had to say..thanks. =)
