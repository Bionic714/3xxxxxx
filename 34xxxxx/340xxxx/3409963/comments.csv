,nabilat,2006-05-23T21:13Z,"Hi... 

I'm looking for a keylogger for RUNESCAPE.

I want to send a keylogger/make people download it, and when they enter their name and password, they send the letters to my computer so I can see what they've been typing. 


If you can help me, please email me at Folmen@msn.com"
,eliteace,2006-05-26T19:24Z,"haha wow, how old are you nabilat?

So am I right to assume this works after being downloaded 4507 times?"
,nabilat,2006-05-27T13:31Z,"Lol :) But i just don't know how it works! Please help me, anyone. Can you help me, eliteace?"
,Noxieas,2006-07-18T21:57Z,".rar corrupted, wont allow install...tried this on 3 different computers same error message."
,Clueless321,2006-11-13T07:12Z,I scanned it and it came up with multiple trojans. I hope all keyloggers have trojans. So do I attach this to a file and get someone to accept it?
,Clueless321,2006-11-13T07:29Z,:( Not workin' for me. It says it's corrupt.

,haijaaa,2011-05-29T21:10Z,"The program doesn't start up automatically in win7. And the hotkey doesn't seem to work and I can't find the program itself in c:/ What can I do when I have it in stealth mode, but can't find it anymore..."
