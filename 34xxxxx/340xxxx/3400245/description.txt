Plot Summary: 16-year-old Maria is forced into Serra D'Aires convent, secretly run by Satanists. Her confessor is in collusion with the Mother Superior. Maria is tortured, forced into sex with men, women, and the horned Devil, and told that it's all a bad dream. She writes a letter to God, and a Knight rescues her, only to fall into the hands of the Inquisition, put on the rack, and condemned to death like Joan of Arc.

The audio is English and OVERDUBBED.  That means the mouth and words won't match since the original is a different language.  I ripped the subs too but the subs are different (English) words, as if it was a direct translation from the movie.

This is a disturbing movie and really makes you think. It is a pretty good movie though. I want to mention that because of the subs and the audio being the way they are, that don't make this a "poor" copy or a bad movie. This is straight from the DVD release and the subs I ripped and checked out make sure they worked right. I just don't want anyone to overlook this because of audio or subs.
