 Alright here is a great band who never got the acclaim they deserved, they were Scotlands version of Jawbreaker and really thats all you need to know to make this worth downloading. I filmed this back in 1995 and theres also one track from Glasgow 1994 which is all i filmed before Rancid played due to a low battery. I have a couple of other shows by them and you if you like this one then i will post those too!

Its filmed in my usual high standard and is a great show by them, enjoy!

I also put a live song by another brilliant Scottish band called Shatterhand just to fill the space up, hope you like them!

Broccoli - Cas'Rock Edinburgh 3rd March 1995 SVCD 35 minutes
Broccoli - Nice And Sleazy Glasgow 22nd October 1994 SVCD 3 minutes
Shatterhand - Planting Seeds Leven Fife March 2002 SVCD 3 minutes

This is in PAL SVCD format and should be burned to CD and it will play in most DVD players. This will fit on 1 80min blank cd-r using nero.

If you want to play these videos on your computer in the proper aspect ratio use a programme called VLC Player it plays everything including most incomplete downloads which is very handy. It also plays bin & cue files. It has no spyware etc and is safe to install. http://www.videolan.org/
