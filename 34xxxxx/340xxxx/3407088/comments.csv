If I could take all your words away and give you but a sparse few, they would be: ?I now know, I am absolute, I am complete, I am God, I am.? If there were no other words but these, you would no longer be limited to this plane.

Your theory is crazy, but it's not crazy enough to be true.
- Niels Bohr

What we are looking for is what is looking.

A hundred times every day I remind myself that my inner and outer life depend upon the labors of other men, living and dead, and that I must exert myself in order to give in the measure as I have received and am still receiving.

,allways_ty,2006-04-08T22:15Z,"why cant i download? i get a message that say is for torrents on TBP only, what does that mean?"
,dihaji,2006-05-07T00:33Z,"Ohh.. dude, I was watching this today on Cable. It was great. I would recommend anyone that has not seen this, to watch it. 

I am not sure about the quality of this download, but looking at the previous comments, there were no complaints.."
,uhohpiratses,2006-07-30T20:47Z,"Guys . . . I'm not trying to debate this here or anything . . . but this movie is NONSENSE.  Check the wikipedia page for more info.  I was so high, and I have never laughed so hard in all my life.  This one lady is credited as being ""RAMTHA"" even though she is in face JZ KNIGHT, because she is ""channeling"" his spirit.  I'm glowing just thinking about it.  

The movie basically tries to legitimize certain life lessons by creating analogies w/ overlysimplified  quantnum physics half truths.  Some of the more legitimate professors and scientists got really mad after this movie because they were interviewed about quantum physics, and were edited to make it look like what JZ KNIGHT wanted.

JZ KNIGHT's organization is a borderline cult, this movie is all about what they wanted to say."
,kitk,2006-08-28T18:05Z,"""Documentary""?! This is the biggest crock of shit ever made; like uhohpiratse said--do some research and see who's behind this propaganda. 
NO disrespect, but anyone who thinks this is mindblowing or incredible or whatever, I urge you to think about the ideas put forth-
Ex:
the Indians didn't see the boats because the boats had never been recorded in their conscience?! WTF?! That water shit?! 
I know it's fun to think that those things could be possible, but no self respecting physicist is down with this drivvle....."
,jornoo,2006-09-30T13:46Z,Never thought i would download my religion on the pirateBay..   im actually gonna seed this :P
,todu,2007-03-17T21:57Z,"This ""documentary"" is not science. It is new age religious bullshit. Read this review before wasting your bandwidth:

,HueMann,2007-07-28T16:50Z,"Wow! After reading the wiki I couldn't dare to think of downloading this film and coming to my own conclusions! You are right Todu! Read the Wiki and trust what it says and while you're at it TRUST ALL the mainstream media outlets like FOX for all we need to know about the world, politics and the universe.

DO NOT THINK FOR YOURSELF!!!
You may awaken in a world that you do not understand."
,JayArsey,2008-03-26T10:35Z,Not science absolute rubbish but thanks for the up.
,Me2222222,2008-12-14T15:17Z,"crap, total crap.
But very entertaining crap.
Thx."
,Miko83,2009-07-10T08:32Z,"@HueMann
Yeah!!
Dont be a thought criminal"
,astroman12345,2009-12-14T12:48Z,"Please!!! Even I already wrote on wikipedia (mitocondrias, in portuguese), are you seriously thinking that wikipedia is more trustful than a scientific movie??!! And go ask stephen hawking if modern science isn't all about speculation... comon the man says that everywere on empty space black holes are constantly formed with tiny fractions of second of life. Einstein, says that light and time itself is changed by gravity... Skepticism is a tool used by many to get imediatly in a superior position, just because they don't have the capability to understand or because they don't want (they are afraid) their idea of the world to be all over the floor in a second!
You can see the movie and then think for your sleves and take your own conclusions! 

(sorry my english, I'm portuguese)"
,BeyondTheBeyond,2010-02-07T07:48Z,"I've seen this movie a shit load of times, and still it amazes me.

Its crazy to look at how much we've changed and evolved since the dark ages. Its really mind-blowing we've even made it this far."
