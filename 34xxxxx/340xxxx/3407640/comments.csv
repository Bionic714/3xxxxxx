,TigerMale,2006-04-19T12:46Z,"get the right codecs and this baby can handle almost ANYTHING, i have never failed on any format conversion, provided as i said, that the right codecs are installed."

,Lucifer Sam,2006-05-18T05:05Z,after ive converted these to DVD files how do i burn them to a dvd? im really having trouble. any solutions?
,ziebila,2006-06-28T23:26Z,"I'm sorry to say - it doesn't seem to handle Quicktime that well. I've converted Quicktime to every option available, but as soon as I burn it to a disc (Nero7) and try playing it on a DVDplayer the picture ""stutters"". (Moves one frame a second - if you get the picture). As long as the converted files remain on the computer there are no problems. Any ideas?!"

,madfocker,2009-08-19T13:25Z,"tried and tested every video convertor online and very few could convert real media to avi/mpeg etc, the few that could were very poor quality, found a free coder and never had a problem since, it's open source, it works brilliant, I am not trying to get people to download a crap endorsment, just try it, promise you wont be dissapointed,
