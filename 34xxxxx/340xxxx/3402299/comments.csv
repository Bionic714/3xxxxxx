,Jammy_Stuff,2006-01-08T01:39Z,Works very well. All of the CD Keys are included and activation cracks. Slight problem that the Frontpage directory is automatically renamed so you have to go to (CD Drive):/FRONTP~1/SETUP.EXE rather than booting it from the auto run screen. Good work though!

Email lps@securenetbahamas.com if you like, Thank you."
