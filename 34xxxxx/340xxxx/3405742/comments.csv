,Twinbird24,2006-12-01T23:06Z,"okay, if it asks for the cd, you either need to get a cd key for the game or get a crach. For a CD key, just go to some serial website that will give you a cd key for the game. Just try going to serialz.to and type Rainbow Six 3. Yeah...just firgure it out, google it. it's not that hard"
