,busterthefox,2011-09-10T12:31Z,"Cool upload. I hate that they put all sorts of protection on the original disk. It wouldn't even let you save it as an MP3! By the way, this torrent doesn't actually include that ""Good Night Punk"" song in the description. In fact, I don't think such a track even exists... Guess I'll Limewire it. ;)"
