It's still under warranty and is in mint condition. its the black 60GB video ipod. comes with an agent18 videoshield too. (thats how i kept it so brand new looking) I paid close to 600 for it when i first bought it a few months ago, so i think my price is fair. Anyways, if you're interested, contact me in private or if you have an ebay account:

Seems to be decent quality. Itunes doesn't fix up the first disc, but does the second disc, so I'm not too fussed about that.. all in all, decent."
