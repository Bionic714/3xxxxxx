   GAME NoTES:

   Star Wars Battlefront II improves upon the original game's single-player
   experience with open-ended, mission-based objectives inspired from all
   six Star Wars films. The compelling storyline spans more than 12 new
   locations, many from Episode III, including volcanic Mustafar and the
   space battle above Coruscant. All-new classic movie moments complete the
   Star Wars Battlefront II experience, as you battle within the interior
   of the Death Star and visit Princess Leia's blockade runner, the Tantive
   IV, as seen at the beginning of Episode IV A New Hope. In addition, at
   certain key moments within the battles, you can feel the Force as a
   Jedi.
