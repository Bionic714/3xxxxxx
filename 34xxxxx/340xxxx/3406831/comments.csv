After updating my price data bank (using qoutes4u) and trying to open a new chart I get the message ""No valid password"" from which I can't go on.

,paraglidinghawaii,2008-01-27T02:46Z,"for those who have to reinstall and want to do it clean, go to the route directory, usually C: and delete these two files:

rasmon.bin
ddefact.bin

they contain the encrypted password to which the program confirms upon startup. if something is amiss here the program will not run."
,adamsteele,2008-03-10T12:06Z,"The Seed works fine. Unfortunately It's the program that doesnot. All it does is install MSADC and restarts. Nothing Else. Just restarts, installs MSADC and restarts, again and again and again.
Sorry."
,adamsteele,2008-03-11T07:20Z,"I gotta apologise to this guy. The package works fine and is comprehensive. The installation where I first tried was corrupt. I tried it on another computer and it works fine. Hats off to the guy's generosity, this pack also contains Trading for a Living Audio Seminar in addition to the pulgins.
Thank you"

Installing is all OK but
- when I run SP4CUpdate.exe (no re-start) I get:

""The decompression of %s failed. There may not be enough free disk space available in the TEMP directory""

Need some help here
Thanks,
