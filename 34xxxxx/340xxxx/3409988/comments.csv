,Gammazoni,2006-03-26T11:59Z,I see... it's for trumpets.
,benutzername,2006-09-20T21:30Z,"Those sheets are standard Jazz sheets written in a C-Clef. If you know how to play Jazz, you should be able to play those songs on ANY instrument...for example on a trumpet ;)"
,Gammazoni,2006-10-23T18:26Z,"Well, then I must rewrite it, because I play in bass clef :/."
,TeeCee2409,2007-09-12T01:16Z,What format is this document in.  Is it word or PDF.

,seanpj,2011-06-20T17:22Z,"Awesome, dude. Thank you!"
,doombag,2011-06-29T23:10Z,"Hey Gammazoni, these are Bb books. Meaning that you can totally play your bass or whatever along with these. Just take it down a full step. So if the sheet says Bb, you are playing an Ab. F=Eb G=F C=Bb .... so on. This is called Transposing. You're just transposing into the key of C. It takes a little getting used to it but anyone that plays Jazz has to do this eventually. "
