Tried UMD Emulator 0.8c, Fast loader 0.7 and Dev Hook 0.22.
I have heard that there is version out that works with FW 1.5. I am currently downloading this version 'Socom.US.Navy.Seals.Fireteam.Bravo' on piratebay, hope that this works..If any one knows how to run this on FW 1.5 please suggest so, heard that this is an awsome game. Many Thanks"

,Smoka,2006-01-17T18:48Z,I read of a way to trick this game into running. You need the beta version and import this game into the beta. I cant remember the link but do some searching and you may find it.
