,Kragar,2006-04-03T12:28Z,"Thanks for these man, I'd never heard of them and was randomly browsing the torrents when I saw this (the other upload actually) so I looked and since it said they were influenced by Floyd (who I love early and later stuff), I thought I'd grab it.  Great stuff, too bad they broke up, they could have made more for me to listen too."
