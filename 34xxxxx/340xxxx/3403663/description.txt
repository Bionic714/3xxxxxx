One of the best British underground neo psychedelic progressive rock groups of the late 90's to come out of Leeds, perhaps too underground for their own good as they never signed a major record deal but had a large following of spore?s around the country. Extensive touring gave them energy and a freak-out in their live sound quite unlike their peers always unfashionable and always unapologetic for it. Influenced by a real mix of bands; Hawkwind, Amon Duule 2, Can, Tangerine Dream, Jimi Hendrix, Big Black, Stooges, Velvet Underground, Pere Ubu, Soft Machine, Captain Beefheart and of course early Pink Floyd they where born in the wrong era but still die hard hippies, die hard sadly being too close to the truth as the drummer Richard Freek sadly died of alcohol abuse in 2002, following which Fast Elbert became a recluse and Mathew became a town planner  which brought an untimely end to the band. Though lost Johnny and CJD still perform under the name Ejection.

Anyway here?s the entire back catalogue, bear with it and you?ll be rewarded with a thousand virgins serving up chip butties on a bed of cannabis leaves in Avalon.

Good luck
