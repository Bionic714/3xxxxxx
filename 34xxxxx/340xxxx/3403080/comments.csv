,old_south,2006-03-02T12:52Z,great movie! everybody who saw mikes movies should also take a look at this one!
,paraglider,2006-11-14T19:49Z,Labelling well earned critisism as hatred is one approach. An intellectual debate is another.
,nowayhose,2007-01-24T06:37Z,"Michael Moore Hates America? I don't blame him. We have the worst president ever, highest crime rates in the world, and our country is falling apart. Anyways, if he hated america so much, he probably wouldn't be in america, and he probably wouldn't be trying to get our soldiers back into america where they are safe. I hate these idiots that think michael moore is a liar. Bush lied about the information on weapons of mass destruction in Iraq when we first went there, but ohh my gosh, someone that isn't president lies and ohh my goshh, he hates america. FAGS"
,SGAK,2007-05-28T14:52Z,Haha this should be funny :)
,CheezuzKraist,2007-09-26T01:50Z,Interesting film even that the title is provocative. It's funny how american's thing that they are the most free nation in the world and that people in other countries can't fullfill their dreams and be anything they want.. I gues that's the part of american daydream. :)
,greasetrap,2008-01-17T21:02Z,"Looking forward too this.  Thanks for the up, just because George Bush is a dick doesn't make Michael Moore any less of a cunt."
,Citizen_Cocaine,2008-01-23T04:27Z,"Go Moore! I for one didnt know that the U.S was such a crapy country before i saw Moores films.. I recommend his latest film, Sicko. Kicks ass.. Go Cuba =p"
,Hampaman70,2008-01-24T08:08Z,"Michael Moore does not hate America. In fact, he loves his country and its inhabitants so much that it pains him that a man who believes being on a mission from God, friends with the bin Ladin family, the big companies' go-between, forbids schools to teach evolution, has tricked the congress into adopting the patriot act (need I say more) has declared himself as the president, sent America on a war the has killed 60000 americans and 650 000 irakies, drained the economy..... Wouldn't you be pissed off if someone did that to your country?"
,Hampaman70,2008-01-24T08:11Z,By the way: if you looked at the links from Reboot yo should get a hint as to whar his ideals are.
,bwmcmaste,2008-03-09T04:51Z,"Hampaman I think you need to quite smoking the dope, and get yourself a spell-check."
,jimmybeam,2008-04-06T17:49Z,"michael moore is the biggest poison in the media. All he does is make fake-u-mentaries, selling lies and OVER-exaggerated stories. He cuts and edits his film so much that he can manipulate gullible viewers just to make money. I truly think he is going straight to hell for all his cut and paste editing of films to totally rip another human while not giving any of them a chance to state facts(which is a word mike needs to learn). Seriously though trying to rip Heston after all he's done w/ charities and others. Just moore is a complete disgrace to the human race."
,freakindawg,2008-06-06T23:26Z,"Weird! I was reading the comments here and I have to admit that when I can substitute Jimmybeam's description of what he thinks Moore is to every news media network in the US, especially FOX.

Jimmybeam said: ""I truly think he is going straight to hell for all his cut and paste editing of films to totally rip another human while not giving any of them a chance to state facts""

The Bush administration had plenty of chances to state facts but they chose to do the opposite in order to illicit a secret agenda. They've repeatedly repeated the same terms (axis of evil, weapons of mass destruction and my favourite ""evil-doers"") so that eventually, they thought that the masses would actually buy the story. About the same way our parents used to convince us that there was a Santa.

The thing is, most Americans aren't kids and the electorate has access to actual witnesses to almost any event that takes place on the planet.

Jimmybeam, the truth is out there! Do some research. Don't let a ship of fools do the research for you. Find out for yourself. Look at media from outside the US. You must understand by now that the World is watching.

If by any chance you're one of those under-educated Americans who thinks that nothing matters outside the USA, then why are you encouraging your government to go to war OUTSIDE THE USA!"
,Purayah,2008-10-10T11:39Z,everyone hates america its nothing new..
,TedsTumor,2008-10-18T21:11Z,Obviously the Eurotrash weasels are jealous because their socialist systems have been proven to be full of shit. What else can you expect to a group of weasels who caved into Hitler.
,hellosir1234,2009-03-26T23:53Z,"THE TITLE IS A SATIRICAL JAB

it's not the aim of the film. don't be fooled."
,cherryrosa,2009-07-26T23:51Z,"Haha TedsTumor! You are such a twat! Us ""eurotrash weasals"" are the only reason Hitler was ever defeated. Also, I'm not sure you really understand what socialism is... Do you actually have any kind of formal education? Bless you though... you're ignorant criticism is actually kind of endearing! You remind me of my two-year old son... so much to learn in such a big confusing world... awww.    "
,cherryrosa,2009-07-26T23:53Z,"and may I also add, that the vast majority of the American population is descended from ""Eurotrash Weasels"". Haha you're such an idiot!"
,neephius,2010-09-21T18:29Z,"Well he has that right the majotity of the Planet hates America fro what they do to their people. The Government has turned the American people into pawns in a game they can not win.
I feel sorry for all the American people and the kids now all the corporations are owning them, that is completely ugly situstion to be in. But they should be less ignorannt now the world outside america can tell the americans how it is."
,neephius,2010-09-21T18:34Z,BUt its true everyone hates America even their own people.
,MJSisco93,2011-03-11T17:39Z,"Citizen_Cocaine...thats not really true.
Just because you see a film that shows the bad parts of America doesn't mean the country is bad.  If I saw a movie about how shitty Cuba is how would you feel if I automatically thought ""wow I didn't realize how shitty of a country Cuba was, glad I live here!"""
,JimmyC916,2011-06-21T17:00Z,"You know what? I'm sick and tired of hearing about this shit about Michael Moore being a traitor and that he hates America. Fuck you little crying-ass bitches. He's the only person standing up for the average Joe. I don't see any of you doing shit. This country has too many prisons, too many politicians who lie, and too many motherfuckin' pussies like you fucks. You love Bush so much, strap on an AK and go fuckin' die for a country that'll just sell you out like so many of our own soldiers. Bitches. ROCK ON, MIKE!!! Freedom of speech, Bitches. Now that's America. "
,aratron_x,2011-09-11T02:25Z,"After watching this movie, I realized that Mike Wilson and his friends have some legitimate points, but the main premise of this movie is what is skewed.  Sure, Moore is very agressive and his ego is even bigger than he is, but that is common among celebrities.  Also, he is certainly not the first person to spin the truth to support his point.  Wilson misrepresented Canadians and their views by focusing on a couple punks.  Moore doesn't hate America, he is dissatsified with members of our government and certain political views.  As passionate as he is about politics, he loves being in the spotlight, just not with someone bent on smearing him.  If Wilson had gotten ahold of Moore, he probably would have done what he decried Moore for doing.  And for a final reason not to hate Moore; Moore openly admitted that he doesn't care if people download his movies without paying.  Even if you think he is a socialist or whatever, he believes in something that you do."
