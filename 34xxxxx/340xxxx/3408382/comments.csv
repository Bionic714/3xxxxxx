Apart from encoding (""smoothering"", where it should be black), at one point movie crashes my MediaPlayerClassic.
Any ideas?"

,HawkPunk,2009-08-21T06:05Z,"This is one of the most brilliant films I've ever seen, and by far Depp's best performance.  It played flawlessly on GOM, which is much underrated.  As far as embedded sub-titles, just un-check them before you feed the torrent to your client, and only download the .avi file.  Thank you so much for this stunning  UP.

,helpgate,2009-12-18T11:20Z,"One of my favorite movies of all time. 

Sadly, the video quality of the rip doesnt it do it justice. Wish it was out on BR but I've got to go and rent it for a higher quality rip. 

Regardless, thanks Beksinski! "
