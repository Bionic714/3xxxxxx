Description: In Jim Jarmusch's best film to date we follow the journey of east coast accountant William Blake who travels into the heart of the West in order to take up a job for rich industrialist Dickinson. Upon his arrival he finds out that the job is no longer available and an unforeseen turn of events leads Blake to kill Dickinson's son. However Blake is injured and a bullet is lodged near his heart; hanging in the balance between life and death and hunted by Dickinson's head-hunters, he embarks in a spiritual journey into the wilderness of the West guided by an Indian mystic named Nobody. Jarmusch delivers us his most poetic, spiritual and allegorical film to date, a dark, surreal Western unlike any you have ever seen. A lot can also be said about Neil Young's moody musical score. Much underrated and overlooked, this is probably the best film to come out of America during the '90s.
