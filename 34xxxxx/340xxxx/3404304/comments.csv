,unpossible,2006-01-25T01:16Z,"OI! WHere did you all go?!? There were 2 seeders and 6 peers, and I had a 1.2 rating, and now you all leave?

THIS IS EPIC! COME ON! UFC 3!"
,unpossible,2006-01-31T02:49Z,"I'm still holding on for this one. 97% and a 2.7 ratio. I must suck at BT technically, because on public trackers I can never get more than 2-10k down while my peers all do 30k or so; on private trackers I can do around 200k. And my ratio is always pretty high. So I'm probably just a dumb non-leech, but I'll keep it up. It would be nice if that niceness was reciprocated. ;)"
,unpossible,2006-01-31T05:25Z,"way to go folks! thanks for the peers for returning. The 'distributed copies' numbers were steadily increasing from 94% a day ago, and now shows 0.990 distributed; I have to think that we can get all of it. Ratio is 2.16 and ticking upwards all the time."
,unpossible,2006-01-31T06:14Z,"0.991 now. This is weird, but one way or another I think we can make this work even without a seed.
nn
I see that you guys are all around the 20% mark or so, but never fear, I'm not going to drop UFC3. Big Mommas House yes. UFC 3 the American Dream, no."
,unpossible,2006-01-31T06:55Z,"0.993 distributed copies now. I'll keep this up through my download of UFC 4, which will take a minimum of 3 or 4 days, and will ensure that the folks on now won't get dropped."
,unpossible,2006-01-31T07:53Z,"0.994 distributed copies and chugging forwards. Way to go peers (although I think there has to be some kind of a bug in bt's reporting or the peer's configuration if the distributed number goes up without new peers ... haha but at any rate we're going to get it, good job. Everyone needs to see the first 5 ufcs."
,unpossible,2006-01-31T08:49Z,going to be down to make a copy at 0.996; be right back.
,unpossible,2006-01-31T09:17Z,"back! made a copy and trying to see if it will be possible, with bookmarks or something, for us to play it even at 0.996"
,unpossible,2006-01-31T20:48Z,"all right! we've got it, so I'm seeding.

congratulations. to the one peer who doesn't have it yet, never fear, I'm not disappearing."
,daqck,2006-04-06T19:53Z,thanx club128 for upping these ones and getting me started. 
,heckle,2006-08-08T12:09Z,Can someone seed this please.
,B-Lovely,2006-08-12T19:34Z,"God bless those who are sharing this, but it doesn't seem like anyone has got it a 100%, so if you have it completely ; PLEASE SEED !

I've searched for this for a long time now and finallly found it, but nobody seems to seed it.

Thanks..."
