Do I combine these files with the pc version?  Does it install like the pc version does?  Please let me know what to do with these files.  Thanks"

,rawgoatsmilk,2006-11-20T16:50Z,where is the .exe file?  i extracted all the files but i can't install anything because there's no .exe file.
,fxppc,2006-12-28T19:51Z,"rawgoatsmilk:  You've got to be joking. Mac programs do not end in "".exe"". Next time check what platform the download is, rather than just assuming everything is for Windows."

I'm sorry I need help.  I downloaded this starter app.  Works great.  Burned the downloaded language .ISO onto a CD.

When I open the application.  It says 'No language data found'.

What am I doing wrong?"
