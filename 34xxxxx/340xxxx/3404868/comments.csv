,ninja_n_pirate,2008-07-05T03:57Z,"someone told me that the  Ogg files can easily be changed into another file format .. is this true?.... 


I am also like LBarto and want to listen to this on my iPod...."
,Joddsus,2008-08-24T09:25Z,"ogg vorbis can be converted usind different tools, google ""convert ogg to mp3"" and you will find a lot of different apps. Sorry for not posting it in mp3 but I prefer ogg vorbis myself, so stop complaining about it being unacceptable before doing a simple goole search for a solution. "
,A_town,2008-09-22T09:32Z,".ogg is perfectly acceptable
thanks for the upload
you can use mediacoder (google it) to convert the file if your hung up on mp3s"
,isafox,2009-01-04T18:47Z,"Cheers for this, it'll take me right back! Hawhaw.

FYI - OGG is a lovely file-format, open source promotes freedoms, iTunes and Apple do not. At all. Make what you will of that"
