For new listeners(cut and paste from Wikipedia):
The Long Beach Dub Allstars were a punk band formed in 1997 and disbanded in 2002.

Eric Wilson and Bud Gaugh met in childhood (in 1979) and later started their first garage punk band, consisting of drums, bass and vocals. They later formed Sublime with Brad Nowell. The Long Beach Dub Allstars (LBDAS for short) were founded after Brad died in 1996 of a heroin overdose.

The band released their debut recording called Right Back, issued in 1999 and their second album was Wonders of the World in 2001.

In 2002 rumors that the band had broken up began to surface. Apparently the band had taken a hard-drug-free vow and some of the band's members had broken this vow, which caused Bud Gaugh to quit. On January 14, 2003 Gaugh was arrested for the possession of marijuana.

Eric Wilson and RAS-1 formed Long Beach Shortbus along with two new members. Bud Gaugh and Opie Ortiz formed Dubcat. Shortbus has had slightly more success than Dubcat, but neither band has sold nearly as well as LBDAS.
