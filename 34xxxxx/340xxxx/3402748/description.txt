Original copies of this 1968 album (the group's only release) now change hands for hallucinogenic prices. Guitarist Randy Hammon recently managed to wrestle licensing rights from PolyGram and now you can hear this young, punk-psychedelic outfit without breaking the bank or going bootleg.

Their self-confessed Hendrix obsession is immediately obvious. First track, Thing In E, is a speeded up version of Jimi's first album, first track, Foxy Lady. Throughout one hears similarly loud echoes. Love obviously motivated the intricate structure and well-executed tempo switches of Someone's Changin', and Country Joe is conjured up by the good-humoured, hippy-funk of Fox Is Sick.

What saves the group from dismissal as well-meaning imitators (and from the vaults of collectors) are the glimpses of raw power they show on fuzzed-up R&B doodlebugs such as Appeal To The Happy and, conversely, moments of left-field, ethnic delicacy, as on Tahitian Melody. Undeveloped potential to go.
