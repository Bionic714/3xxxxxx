All unlicensed teams now have correct kits, all kits have shared palettes so you can mix shirt/shorts/socks

New boots, balls, ad boards, ref kits

Correct emblems for all teams

Correct logos for all competitions

The following stadiums have been replaced

Sapporo Dome > Karaiskaki (Olympiakos)
Kashima > Celtic Park
Nagai > Ataturk Olympic Stadium
Olympic Stadium Tokyo > Stadio Friuli (Udinese)
Oita Big Eye > Ibrox
Saitama > Estadio do Dragao

Bloemfontain Rugby Stadium > OAKA Spyros Louis (Panathinaikos)
Nacional Santiago > Ramon Sanchez Pizjuan (Sevilla)
Online Stadium > Zuiderparkstadion (ADO den Haag, needs unlocking first)
Newlands > Stadio Luigi Ferraris (Sampdoria)

I?ve not replaced any menus/backgrounds or music as these are down to personal taste

Because I've decided to use scorpio's option file it caused problems with my original patch, so I've used the kits from DjPelle's kit patch, I've noticed some were out of date (Middlesbrough & Lazio) and have replaced them with this seasons kits, there may be more, if so I'll release an update some time soon

I've still got a few things to fix such as the ball names and hopefully the boot names and preview pics
