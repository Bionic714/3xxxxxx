,apkosmic,2006-01-11T07:35Z,"All episodes are complete, of reasonable quality and play fine on all apps i have.  when i posted i should have listed the episodes contained as part of the info.  Season 1 eps 1-7 and seacon 2 eps 1-4.  No episodes are missing, rather since posting there have been more episodes."
