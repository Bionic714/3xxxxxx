,DolphWulff,2006-03-12T22:31Z,"guys, check this out to add keyboards: Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator:

http://www.zdnet.nl/downloads.cfm?id=36575

Install it on a machine with a full XP version, open it up, select the keyboard language you want as a base, use the ""create setup package"" function, copy to the barenaked xp installation, run it, voila! you have Danish, Swedish, whatever layout you need! :)"
,DolphWulff,2006-03-12T22:41Z,"btw, this is neither sp1 nor sp2, it's just a clean xp corporate edition, build 2600 rtm! beautiful! :)

a tip: if you want usb 2.0 support without installing sp1, try googling for Q312370_WXP_SP1_x86_ENU.exe - that's the hotfix for usb 2.0."

,ace-x,2008-08-11T23:07Z,im having problems on burning this. what do i do? i have nero. please someone tell me step by step on what to do. ive wasted like 8 cd's trying to do it but i dont know how. ive never done iso files before. 
,ace-x,2008-09-17T01:05Z,"wow i commented on this torrent over a month ago!! i didnt even remember till i came back to this, and scrolled down to see my comment lol..

and i did FINALLY learn how to burn it. bootable iso.
:)"
,vinsup,2008-10-16T16:43Z,"Wow,

Just the thing I was looking for.

I have downloaded the iso and burnt it on a CD. 

The reason for doing this was I wanted to have a (free) netbook option on an old unused Dell Latitude L400 lying in the house. The installation went very smoothly, but I realised that it doesnt have support for pcmcia / wifi cards.

Is there a way for sorting this out? Also I tried installing IE 6, but it doesnt work.

Any help will be appreciated.

Thanks,

Vinsup "

Is there any way to make the PCMCIA card slots (Ricoh 5c478) work?

I can't seem to find any drivers from the net. "

,daphaze,2009-12-31T13:56Z,"can't use this, no PCMCIA slot support, various other unknown drivers, Windows Update does not function, no using chrome browser, even USB drive had to load drivers from CD separately I think.  Moving to a larger build, sorry"
