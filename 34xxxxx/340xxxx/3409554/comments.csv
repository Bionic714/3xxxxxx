Is it not possible to rip the 5.1 layer from a SACD?

I only got two channel from this file."
,Halbermunken,2006-05-08T18:40Z,"It's two channel 2.0 16/44.1 Audio. Very good quality though.

As far as I know no one has ever succesfully ripped DSD."
,bronto64,2006-07-24T14:50Z,"Hi, do you have a playlist, is a superb test cd, thnx for this."
,DonMaJic,2008-02-13T13:15Z,"Does anyone know how to burn this? I've tried various programs that I normally use to burn images and none support audio. I also tried mounting it with Daemon, then ripping the audio, then burning them individually but my SACD player wont play it. Any ideas?"
,fongolio,2008-02-16T22:52Z,Because the extension is .nrg it tells me it's a Nero image file. Use Nero burning Rom or any other burning program capable of burning Nero images.
,spamfritters,2008-05-12T01:23Z,Only one person I know of has ripped DSD from an SACD -he said if he did the whole album it would fill uop several drives..however since ive collected  SACD s the simple answer is to re rerecord all the channels and put them back together in and in synch..so its a  manual approach but it works..also save out in best format ie 96khz 24bit rather than the usual dts 48/16 route as 44.1 dont cut it also theres decimation but thats another story..ideally you should save the multichannel audio in lossless to and dts is lossy...big files (gigs!) but that theonly way i know..u can make dvd audios from them...

,ncdrawl,2008-09-21T22:11Z,"it is impossible to rip the DSD/SACD layer from a SACD.... What happened was probably it was a dual layer/hybrid CD and the REDBOOK layer was ripped. SACDs require special authoring processes and there are only a handful of plants that deal with the medium. There are NO consumer tools to handle this sort of thing, and as I said.. ""Ripping"" an SACD is not possible.

,mrpras,2010-04-25T18:25Z,"I'm not sure what you mean, but if an SACD is playing audio from your sound card you can rip that whatever frequency it is.

There are softwares for that that give you a ""virtual sound-card"" which receives the audio from the program and just saves it as a wav (for example)..

If something can be heard, it can be ripped. I don't know why they bother to protect anything, it just drives up the costs and reduces real sales.. Learn from the VHS piracy story!!! (Piracy disappeared when VHS tapes stopped costing ÂŁ80 and went down to ÂŁ5-15 ish.."
,mrpras,2010-04-25T18:26Z,"Also, isn't sacd meant to be 96KHz/24bit?

I don't see the point if it's 44.1/16"
