Or am I, perhaps, the only one who's too thick to find it? +++
Either way, help me out, someone, would you?

,Revoj,2007-02-08T17:49Z,I can't find the Crack.rar either.  Can someone please help me.
,hackfame,2007-04-04T18:00Z,Could Someone Post a User Name and Password that works if no crack is provided
,AndyParka,2007-04-15T16:42Z,I agree... a serial or crack would be nice

,ENi,2007-06-23T00:17Z,"can I create pixelfonts with this, is BitFonter included?"
,Knottelit,2007-11-24T09:31Z,Then what do i do with the Patch? 
,BabeBrown,2007-11-27T03:34Z,"Just install, then copy and paste the patch.exe file to the FontLab folder in Program Files and run it there. (Click the ""C"" to run it.)
When you open FontLab for the first time, it will bring up a registration window. Enter any name you like and then leave the registration number space empty and click ""OK"" or whatever it is. It will register the app...no need for a serial.

Does anybody have the latest version of this? Also, I'd really love to see FontLab's ScanFont latest version here as well.

Peace!
Babe"
,BabeBrown,2007-11-27T03:35Z,BTW...thank you very much for sharing this one. :)

,machinaspeculatrix,2008-03-29T02:30Z,"the path really works

Any ideia where could I found a tutorial ?

,Magpie13,2008-04-20T21:08Z,"great patch and upload!  Thanks useros.  The readme tells you all you need to do!
install - run patch in installed folder - then you can use ANY name or serial...or none! choice is yours mwa ha ha!"
,blacksaturn77,2008-04-26T05:58Z,"Excuse my NEWBness, but when I unzip this (winrar) I only see two files, an .nfo and a .txt. Am I supposed to unzip the .nfo or convert it or have already screwed something up... thanx"
,zwc101,2008-10-07T08:02Z,"The file is clean.  Great torrent. Will seed

@blacksaturn: you missed a part of the file, redownload it.  Just run the install file like normal, drag ""patch.exe"" into the program files directory, then click the ""C"" looking button that pops up.  After that it works perfectly"
,danelectro,2008-10-17T20:34Z,"I downloaded 6 torrents for this software and this is the only one that worked. No virus, no nothing.

1. Open Fontlab.rar and run the installer.
2. Copy patch.exe to the folder where you installed Fontlab. It must be on the same folder as Studio5.exe
3. Run patch.exe and click on the ""C"" button on your left.
4. Open FontLab. It will ask you for a serial number.
5. Do not type anything and just press OK.
6. Buy useros a drink.

Have fun!"
,DevonWolf,2008-10-22T07:14Z,Thanks for this... badly needed.
,stickybeak,2008-10-24T06:08Z,"I get an error shown below while trying to ""generate font"":

you dont even need to put in the name because if u use a name you will get a pop up saying ""invalid serial number"" leave the user name and the serial number boxes blank and just press ""OK"" after using the patch :)

I want to add to this comment:
it works, if you leave ALL fields bland - name and serial number as well. I typed a name and it didn't register. After that, reading instructions in comments, I left all blank, and it didn't register either. ONLY after I completely uninstalled FontLab and reinstalled it again, I could register by leaving all fields blank."
,geo119,2009-01-20T19:56Z,"Thanks, danelectro. :) And thanks useros, works perfectly"

dood, this is the fuckin internet; if you would do your research instead of wasting time w/ posts like these, stating to the rest of the internet that you would apperciate it if we could take time out of our lives to teach you macfags how to operate a computer. so stfu go google virtualbox, download a flavor of xp, install xp on your new (free) virtual-machine, download this torrent, install on xp,  profit; . . .otherwise, please tie your twat completely shut and refrain from posting why some program is not compaitable w/ your apple crapinitosh or whatever you jack-offs are calling it these days."

if anyone has the mac version it would greatly be appreciated! thanks useros for this one though! nice job

There's a Mac 'version' of this program owned by the same people called Fontographer. You'll most likely have better luck with that than trying to adapt to a Windows program."
,theteabag,2009-04-11T04:08Z,"useros - thanks for the torrent, worked great!

confused people - You install the program by running the FLS5WinFull.exe. 
Then you put the patch.exe into the folder where it installed. (should be C:\Program Files\FontLab\Studio5 )
Run the patch from there. The patch looks odd. You have to click the funny looking ""C"" button on the left. The X button closes it.
Then run Fontlab. It asks you for a registration name and key. Enter any random word you like for name, and no key. It will accept it. That's it. It worked for me like that.

,Marjeo,2009-10-09T17:47Z,I found the way how to install patch.No help nedeed.Thanks
,BlowBye,2009-10-21T13:53Z,"Good torrent, thanks +1, but this is not software for beginners. If you're not a semi professional typographer it will take you a while to figure this one out. No help-function. Tutorials on the website go back many years etc. etc. which is strange for software that retails for $650.

Best way for support is Google (like http://www.vimeo.com/681300 ) and once you get a hang of it, its a serious piece of work. Like the kerning function."
