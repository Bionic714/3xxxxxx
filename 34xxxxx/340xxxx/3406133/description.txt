"DropStitch" features some of the world?s best professional snowboarders including Olympic medal winners and International Champions such as Kjersti Buaas, Kelly Clark, Natasza Zurek and Doriane Vidal. DropStitch is directed by World No 3 ranked halfpipe rider Lesley McKenna and photographer Josie Clyde - "The motivation for us to make this film is that we wanted to show people what it is like to be a professional snowboarder. Snowboarding is such a great lifestyle and we hope by making DropStitch we can motivate other girls to get involved in the sport. Now there is a really strong field of international female snowboarders that travel, live and ride together and we felt their efforts, trials and tribulations deserved to be documented"
