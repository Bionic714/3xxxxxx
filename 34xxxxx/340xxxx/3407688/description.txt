The Complete Decca Studio recordings of Louis Armstrong and the All Stars
This out of print SIX CD set collected together all the recordings Louis made with his small group in the studio - as opposed to live concerts - 1950-58.  Starting out with the band that featured JACK TEAGARDEN and EARL HINES, later sessions featured ED HALL and TRUMMY YOUNG. Other musicians were added in the studio from time to time particularly for the recordings that were originally put out under the title 'Musical Autobiography'. As a bonus, Mosaic managed to find FIVE unissued tracks as well as issuing, for the first time, the full unedited duet (LOUIS/BILLY KYLE) version of 'Dear Old Southland'.
