"The Hour is a talk show with a different take on the news; and George and his team of producers, videographers and regular contributors are there to inform and deliver the message that nothing is sacred within the news of Canada and the world."

Season 2, Episode 3 (2005-11-09). 44 minutes.

Captured from CATV to 12 mbps MPEG2 video / 384 kbps MP2 audio, then transcoded to 650 kbps XviD video / 96 kbps MP3 audio.

Somehow the audio got out of sync by a second or two for a segment of the show, but it gets back in sync after a little bit. Also, the first half-second or so of the intro is missing. Sorry!
