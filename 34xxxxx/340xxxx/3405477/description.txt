"Highly emotional, excitable, and driven" is how the official Felicity Web site describes the TV drama's title character. If only that side of the precocious teenager were more often reflected on this soundtrack album. Stultifying slow, midtempo balladry with often painful lyrical imagery is the rule here; too rarely do classic Aretha Franklin and Peter Gabriel tracks (and more recent ones by Neil Finn and Ivy) relieve the overwhelmingly "sensitive" atmosphere fostered by Heather Nova, Joan Jones, and series costar Amy Jo Johnson. --Rickey Wright
