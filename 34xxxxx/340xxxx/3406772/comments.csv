,Peebo,2008-05-15T08:12Z,My apologies.. my sound drivers were screwy. Good torrent.
,Peebo,2008-05-15T08:15Z,Wait... there IS no sound... aw fuck..
[T],Krif,2008-06-04T11:45Z,In VLC the sound is just fine. Thanks!
,Harry Q Hammer,2009-06-13T09:41Z,"Yeah, the sound is fine.  Unfortunately the video codec is some early version of Windows Media so the quality is not as good as you would expect from the file size compared to DivX, XviD, H264, or the like.  Also, there are some interlace artifacts and the picture is quite dark, with some detail lost completely in certain low contrast scenes.  However, it is definitely watchable, at least until a better encode comes along.

Thanks for the upload."
