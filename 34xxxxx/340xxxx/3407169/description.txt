***Some folks in here have a nasty habit of spamming my posts with false virus warnings, and would eventually, possibly, try to get me banned from this place. I upload A LOT of material about 9/11 being a staged event, and they seem to trigger a lot of those false virus warnings from a user named "b2pilot187". Now, he is obviously either a disinformer or simply just the everyday-idiot, because my files are videofiles, hence impossible to infect with a virus. This user has been reported to the admins of this place, so I hope this matter will be solved sooner than later. Until then, simply ignore this person. But I would urge anyone not to ignore a virusscan in any event. I suspect he won't even read this, because he simply searches for "911" and spam each and every post with these warnings. Hence, you will probably find another one below, in the comment section.***

Very good program, (considering the fact it was on meanstream TV during primetime, and the fact that finally 2 prominent Ministers are saying it)"
