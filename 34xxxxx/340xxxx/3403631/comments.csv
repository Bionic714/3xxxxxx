,okbyethen,2009-01-25T07:57Z,"Skip this 128, look for something that is not compressed into Tin can noise. Anyone with a decent VBR?"
,Enverex,2010-12-19T20:10Z,"charfordcharford: You used 128Kbit and ""Good Quality"" in the same sentence. On the same note, why do almost no music torrents contain any quality information like bitrate? Things like that should be required as the absolute minimum!"
