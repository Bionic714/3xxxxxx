,djphazer,2008-01-30T21:11Z,"There is a track missing from the Danse Macabre Remixes... Posed to Death (Mojolators Remix). Also, the entire Blank Wave Arcade rip is horrible - skips everywhere. Other than that, good stuff.

If anybody can point me to some more The Faint torrents - please."

,SenRepus,2008-07-03T14:16Z,"Deleted this as soon as I realized that Blank Wave Arcade was terrible quality. This is also missing a lot of other stuff... not worthy of being called a Discography, it's just a collection. Thanks anyway."
,brent_reddish,2008-09-05T19:49Z,Not only is it missing Media it's missing Sine Sierra and Fasciinatiion. Good luck finding Sine Sierra I've been looking all over for a good torrent for it. If anyone finds it let me know please
,brent_reddish,2008-10-04T01:25Z,O i got Sine Sierra
,strazdje,2009-04-03T11:03Z,"i found sine sierra
