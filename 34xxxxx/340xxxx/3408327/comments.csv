What it means that this release (or a leak, actually) does not represent the quality of the final release in almost any regard. This one is buggy and crashy and full of problems that will be solved until any real releases are made.

I'd like anyone who considers downloading this to check this conversions developers' opinions about this thing in this thread.

To those of you who have downloaded a program claiming to be a Freespace 2- 
based alpha-state modification of the television show, 

'Battlestar Galactica: Reimagined'

You should be aware that the makers of this modification do not claim
responsibility towards you or anyone associated with its release. This mod
in its current state is effectively unplayable and is not up to the 
standards set by the development team. This means that we cannot offer you
any guarantee or warranty towards its performance, coding standards or its
interaction with your computer. We make no assurances whatsoever that this
mod won't chew up your hard drive, thrash your video card or force your OS
to lie smouldering in a molten heap.

We have not released this mod to the public yet, for precisely this reason. 
We would like for this game to be as entertaining and fun as possible, and 
we know that we're not quite there at this stage.

If you still wish to DL this thing, go ahead. I, for one, am going to wait for a really functional and playable version. Choice is all yours.
