,Freelancer,2006-03-20T17:01Z,"You need a TV tuner (either built-into the gfx card or as a separate card) to watch tv. If you don't have that, then no you can't watch tv. You can however hook up a VCR to the Composite/S-Video input of your gfx card if it supports VIVO, and use that as a tuner."

,Posthuman,2006-10-22T04:29Z,"You need to set the DVD player you use to use the PureVideo decoder. It's NOT a DVD player, just a decoder. If your player uses it, you'll see an icon in your system tray when you play DVDs.

This works with at least Windows Media Player (WMP), Media Player Classic (MPC), PowerDVD and Zoom Player and probably any player of some quality.

There is NO software decoder that can compare to this quality. And this uses less CPU than any software decoder. You'll notice that when you start playing HD movies (Blu-ray Disc and HD DVD)."
