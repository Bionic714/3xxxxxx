,Sanicle,2007-01-24T15:52Z,"I am SICK of people creating panics about viruses. I have scanned all the files in this torrent, and all files created by the installers with spybot, ad-aware, AVG and Norton. Nothing. Zip. Nada. Folder Setup.exe"" is entirely unnecessarry though, so if any people are put of downloading this by other peoples stupid scarefests then it's very simple - deselect that file from the file list!"
,diyari92,2007-01-31T09:03Z,seed motha fucka
,Mitsus,2007-02-01T09:34Z,"Yeah, Folder Lock.exe IS a trojan. It uses a clickteam patcher. First, it screws up your internet and makes you restart your computer. When you do, it uses that patcher and it replaces your svchost.exe and iass.exe with some shit that tried to access the internet and I blocked it. Any ideas on how to remove, and for the people that found it with virus scanners, WHAT DID YOU USE? I unfortunately opened this and had to find out the side effects by myself. AVG finds nothing."
,Mitsus,2007-02-01T09:40Z,"Places both those files in C:/Windows

For some reason they aren't in use and I was able to delete them. That's weird."
