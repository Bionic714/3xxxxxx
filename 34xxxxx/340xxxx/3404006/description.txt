I went to L&M's 2005 "Sittin' In Again" tour with hesitation. Would they only play their pop and Best Of tunes, or would they delve into their deeper, progressive cuts that I've loved for all these years.

Much to my delight, they weighed in heavily with the latter.

So here's a collection of those deeper and longer cuts (with a few Jimmy gems tucked in as well). If you're at all a fan of Folk-Rock-Progressive Jazz fusion, I don't think you'll be disappointed. ENJOY!
