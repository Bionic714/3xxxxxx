Caroline and Peter Cave are househunting, and come across an old rundown house, Winyard, in the woods. One morning they are found garroted in their car 200 yards from the house. The murder weapon is a piano wire. The first one on the scene is DC Ben Jones (Jason Hughes), who is persuaded by Inspector Barnaby to assist him in his investigations, as DS Scott is off sick (and never to return).
