This russian animation translates as "You just wait!" - and is about all of russian you need to understand it. Starting as a copy of the western tom-and-jerry-type cartoons, the series soon took a direction of its own. You'll enjoy it more if you can understand the cultural background and recognize some of the popular soviet music used - but it's by all means not a must.


The cartoons are in Russian only, with no subtitles or alternate language feature.
