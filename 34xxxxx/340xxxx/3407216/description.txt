This includes the 16 music files found on the Total Annhiliation game. They are encoded in 320 KPBS MP3 Files to save bandwidth and let them spread faster, and were ripped from the game CD, which considering the age and use of my CD, they don't seem to have any errors in the files ;).

The real reason for this torrent is for people who have downloaded the game and can not hear music. The actual game is designed as a Mixed Mode CD-Rom, both CD 1, and 2 have the Soundtrack written to them as Mixed Mode CD's. The music accounts for roughly 300 megabytes of each CD. Most people have converted their CD's to DVD's with extra's attached. The problem is, DVD's do not support mixed Mode, therefore it is IMPOSSIBLE to attach the soundtrack to the DVD without editing the way the game detects and plays the music.

To use this with any version of the game, just burn all the files to a CD-ROM, there is a small mp3, 01, which just takes the space of the first file, which the game doesen't play, since a mixed mode CD keeps the data files as track 1. You don't need to burn it, but then 02 will fail to play during the game.

My personal reccomendation of how to play is to either use the NO CD crack, or mount a DVD (which you can download from a few torrents) for the game. Create a music CD from the tracks, and encode it to your personal disk image choice (I use CUE), and mount it. Whenever you launch the game you'll always have music now. 

You can of course use the tracks burnt to an audio CD for music in the game as well. If there is any demand, i'll upload my Images I use, Including the music one, which is a direct rip from the original CD (As to lose no quality) but for now this should help everyone who misses the music.
