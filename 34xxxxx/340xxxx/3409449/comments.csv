,Powerslave0,2012-01-10T03:02Z,None of the provided keys work.
,Powerslave0,2012-01-10T03:41Z,"FM634-HJ3QK-6QVTY-RJY4R-XCR9J

That one works!

I took one from another torrent, but they typed the the second set of #s as HJ3Q(R), when it's HJ2Q(K).  Some people also have the final two as J9, when it's 9J!  People need to proof their work!  I figured it out using two sets of keys given. both with typo's and found the right one."
,Powerslave0,2012-01-10T03:45Z,Still need to use Activate hack
