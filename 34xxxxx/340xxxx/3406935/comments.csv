,SoundWall,2006-01-04T15:17Z,"Has anyone else had trouble burning this thing?
I got three bad burns of it using Nero 7 and NTI CD/DVD Maker Gold.

Nero aborts after about 97% and NTI after just a few percents.

Since the rar unpacked properly it doesn't seem to be anything wrong with the download.

I'm using DVD+R discs (is this the problem?)."

,mista_g_,2008-04-08T04:55Z,"I like to use DVD Decrypter to burn my x-box game ISO's.  I use this on soft-modded x-box, with MXMC.  You can also ftp or burn and rip with the ripping program within some XBMC builds.  Thanks for the upload, shady - its a small size so its xbox, not 360 right?  Sounds like a fun game, I loved the Matrix movies."
