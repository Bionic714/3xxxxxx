,WAcked,2006-01-14T23:43Z,How should i burn it? its no img file.. just a heck lot of folders :/
,RobinStarfighter,2006-01-24T15:09Z,I don't know.. I just saw that too. When I get home I'm gonna try to convert the mainfolder with Qwix (into a Xbox-ISO) and I will let you know if it worked..
,RobinStarfighter,2006-01-24T15:11Z,"Sorry about the double-post, Firefox fucked it up (Woot? Firefox? YES!)

Anyway, it worked! :D

If you don't have Qwix, download it here: http://www.teamavalaunch.com/qwix/
It's a very small and handy program."
,dan_plus_o,2006-01-25T21:43Z,I got firefox also. I haven't downloaded it yet but I download Ninja Gaiden Black and it was a bunch of files. All I did was use C-Xbox-Tool to make the folders into an image and it worked fine.

,gezlewis91,2007-12-28T02:25Z,"If you don't know what to do with numbered folders, here's a simple guide to follow: 
1. Install WinRar
2. Right click on any one of the numbered folders and click ""extract here""
3. WinRar will now extract the .ISO to that folder
4. Burn Iso onto a DVD using Nero Burning Rom"
