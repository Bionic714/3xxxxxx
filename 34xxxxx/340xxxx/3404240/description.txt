Fields: A short-lived Band with two former members of KING CRIMSON of some sort(Barry,Mc Culloch)(and ex-RARE BIRDie (Graham Field).
There is also a connection with:M.Mann's Earthband,ELP ,Gordon Haskell and Arthur Brown.
The music can best be described as something between Procol Harem(Not So Good 'title'sic),Emerson,Lake and Palmer(While the Sun Still Shines),Early Renaissance(Three Minstrels)and a lot of:King Crimson of course
One radio-hit on it:'A friend of mine'with a 'Mendelssohn-like organ introduction).
'Feeling Free' and 'A place to lay my head' are  outstanding tracks.
This is a very good album....and I forgive them to take so much from previous mentioned bands..... They all were member of them ,they add enough creativity and power ( and don't forget and it's their only album.)
A very beautiful poster is included (first pressing)
I own a vinyl version ,as the Japanese CD release is 'very hard to find)
