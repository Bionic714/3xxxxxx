,Oberthun,2008-01-06T19:14Z,"Hi. I have previously downloaded a different version of KOTOR2 from piratebay, but it kept crashing in the begining where you take control of the droid and open the emergency hatch from the computer in the fuel depot. As soon as the computer is activated, my droid gets gunned down, the screen turns black and i take control of my main character. I deleted the game, downloaded this version and the same bloody thing happens the exact same place. I used xiso to copy the game to my xbox hdd, and I wonder if anybody else had the same problem or have any clue as to how to solve it???"
,voxitage,2008-01-17T18:58Z,"The crashing at the fuel depot when playing from a hard drive is a pretty well known glitch, that comes with good news and bad news.

The bad: You have to use a dvd to get past that part. There's patches that claim to fix it, but I've never gotten them to work.

The good: That's the only time the game will crash like that, so you only need to use a disc for that 2 minute segment."
