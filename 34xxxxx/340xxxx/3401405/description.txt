                       System of a Down has found platinum success with
                       an unlikely message: politics. Mixing heavy
                       guitars, spastic rhythms and oddly humorous
                       lyrics, System of a Down have been delivering
                       their bold statements beginning with their
                       self-titled debut. Relentless touring and a rabid
                       underground following positioned System of a Down
                       to achieve critical and popular acclaim with
                       Toxicity. 2001 found System of a Down all over
                       the radio and mainstream media. Despite this
                       newfound fame, the band members never deviated
                       from their messages of subversion and political
                       activism.

                       In 2005, System of a Down released Mezmerize, the
                       first half of a two volume album. Mezmerize
                       features a driving attack on the current
                       government. The fantastic guitar riffs of Daron
                       Malakian and the inventive battery of bassist
                       Shavo Odadjian and drummer John Dolmayan power
                       the engine of System of a Down. Their
                       astonishingly original music is heard in a new
                       light on The String Quartet Tribute to System of
                       a Down. Violins, viola, and cello re-imagine the
                       songs of Mezmerize as miniature symphonies. These
                       indelible songs will be enjoyed by both hardcore
                       System of a Down fans as well as anyone who
                       appreciates a driving string section.
