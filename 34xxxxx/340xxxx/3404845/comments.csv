,Aronnax,2006-01-15T20:39Z,Can anybody downloaded the file confirm this? Dose it work?
,eightbithero,2006-01-15T21:11Z,"Don't waste your time.  Your PS2 can't play a burned Boot CD/DVD (unless it's already modified).
After all, if it could play a burned disc with no modification, you wouldn't need a boot disc."
,peterman9898,2006-01-22T19:33Z,"i haven't tried this yet torrent yet, but you are able to play burned dvd-r movies on ps2."
,thebiggie,2006-02-06T03:27Z,stfu
,FatDaddyWampus,2006-02-11T21:46Z,"Yo, peterman, the PS2 will play burned movies without a modchip.

Have you seriously never tried to just stick it in the PS2 and see what happens?"
,dmonwill,2006-02-22T23:32Z,One more thing nothing beats a good ModChip
,krille__1986,2006-03-16T21:23Z,"swap magic 3.6 plus it's much better then this, sorry to say it, but thats the way it is..."
,aronlk,2006-04-12T16:03Z,"well, the meaning of boot cds is to play burned cds. and since this is a burned cd it wont work :) "
,djfazer,2006-04-18T17:05Z,"well, who needs mod chip anyway :) cd exploit works perfect! and its free! (psone cd in and software on the memorystick and it launches elf:s from  memorystick)"
,gonzoz,2007-02-25T07:44Z,det er en joke virker ikke
,damp_linus,2007-03-05T23:40Z,you can play burned dvd's on your PS2 if it is dvd kvalety (kvalite p책 svenska) so if you download a dvd-r movie you can watch it on your PS2 whit out mod-chip so this fing mayby work
,cruz9131,2007-08-14T22:00Z,kvalety=quality
,oldschoolrockstar,2007-09-22T04:38Z,"I have Magic Swap 3.6, but that only boots ps2 games, I'll see if this works for psx games. "
,oldschoolrockstar,2007-09-22T04:50Z,"I only hope this works with the combination to my swap magic on a ps2 ver 4. The cogswap method doesn't boot up psx games on it as well. I heard theres a way to use programs to start psx games with swam magic, but if I could boot this disk with it. I'll use it. "
,Davidbeats23,2008-01-30T10:36Z, i tried stealing my girlfriends modified ps2 and took its modd solderd it to mines then intall this thing and i took out its modd again and put it back on her ps2 and play burned games on mine and it works!this is my suggestion so far for those who can't work this thing up!also you need to have a soldering experience so one mistake could kill yours and your girlfriends ps2!
,Davidbeats23,2008-01-30T10:40Z,also i crushed her ps2 while doing this so i'm dead yeah!
,XMAGUSX,2008-07-26T03:00Z,"Anybody who downloads this is an idiot, just like the people who download the Swap Magic discs without a modchip or suitable softmod.

First of all, the PS2 isn't going to read just a EXE file on a burnt disc, especially one that's 2 megabytes. The CD has to have around 600-700 MB's of data on it (even if it's just a dummy file), or else a thing called the TOC on the disc you're trying to boot won't correspond with the 2 MB on the disc you're trying to trick the system with.

Second of all, if the PS2 would be able to read this file on a burnt disc, then there's no reason it shouldn't be able to read a burnt game. Too bad that it can't.


The easiest and cheapest way to boot PS2 backups without a modchip is a memory card exploit, all it requires is:
-A PC-to-PS2 save transferring disc such as Max Drive
-A USB Drive
-A spare memory card
-Some PC files to compile the exploit
-A PS1 game
-A slide card to swap discs with

If you're interested, look up he Independence Compiler (or something like that), it hasn't been updated in a while but it still works."

That's my release (Da-Expert) I did it as a joke back in the old days when all these stupid idiots kept asking for a PS2 BootCD. There's also a DivX player and a fake PS2 Emulator (which only reboots your PC). 

It's all crap, all FAKE - all you do is burn coasters ROFLMAO If you're stupid enough to try then you deserve a coaster!

Playstation & Playstion 2 Games use ""Hardware"" key protection, forget all the BS about zero sectors and whatnot you've heard...it is a code on the actual ROM disc this *cannot* be copied as it is NOT software...so just buy the boot disc or a mod chip!
