Mystique?s Mystical Journeys was a 20-month worldwide search for
the next Miss Mystique. 

More than 4,000 models submitted their photos online, and the fans
and editors of Mystique chose 29 semi-finalists. In groups of 6
(one group was only 5), they traveled with Mystique to an exotic
location every three months for photo shoots, interviews, and fun
adventures and games. Two winners came out of each group of six.
All the winners then traveled to St Vincent & The Grenadines in
late August 2005 to compete for the title of Miss Mystique 2006
and a $25,000.00 modeling contract. 

Features full length layouts of the ten finalists: Christine Nguyen,
Jessica Barton, Victoria Anisova, Kathy Sander, Luana Lani, Amiee
Rickards, Kalucha, Chrystal Lee, Rebecca DiPietro, and Elizabeth
Kelly. Plus, abbreviated layouts of four other semi-final round
winners: Jannah Burnham, Valerie Baber, Nicole Conrad, and Sunisa Kim.
