,yupman,2006-02-24T00:11Z,pls seed?
,mrjayno5,2006-04-09T22:13Z,Why .wav files?????? These files are too big!!!
,Alibloke,2006-05-17T12:47Z,"Finally someone who posts .wav files!  When will people learn that mp3's suck?  More quality, it's not like we don't have the bandwidth nowadays."
,Hugs4all,2006-06-29T04:56Z,"Yes it is. It'll take me at least a week to get these, even then it would be a hell of a time seeding them."
,bonsushi,2006-07-23T00:30Z,are you stupid? mp3's are better quality. you are surely a dumbass.
,spyhunter,2006-07-26T02:21Z,"actually mp3s are NOT better quality than wav files, however mp3s are significantly smaller files sizes"
,Whitebelt,2007-01-21T12:31Z,Any chance on Seeding this one again?
,FieroGT42,2007-06-28T23:01Z,"WAV files waste space, processing, and bus bandwidth, not to mention internet bandwidth!  MP3 does lose a little quality so it's not ideal for archiving.

The answer?  FLAC!  Free Lossless Audio Codec.  Smaller space but with ZERO loss.

Anyway, thanks for the tunes!"
