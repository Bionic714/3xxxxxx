This is a Nordic retail decrypted with DVD-Decrypter.
Everything is in there which means :

Video      :   PAL 144minutes, two discs, 16/9 Anamorphic
Audio      :   Russian DD5.1, English DD5.1(dub), French DD5.1(dub)
Subtitles  :   English, Russian, Swedish, French, German, Spanish, Portuges, Italian, Dutch, Arabic, Hebrew, Chinese, Japanese
Extras     :   Some interviews and a few russian trailers.
Menu       :   yessss

You can stuff it all onto a DL-disc or split it on two singellayer without compressing the video. You can actually sqeeze in a few of the extras - but you will have to take away the dubbed audio tracks (english & french).
Why do they dub - stupid cods ?

And, NO, I have NOT stripped any other nordic subs... there were'nt any !
