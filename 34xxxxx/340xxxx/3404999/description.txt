     In World War, the four Pevenses children: Peter Susan, Edmund and 
     Lucy are evacuated from London to the country house of an eccentric 
     old professor. There, bored and restless, first Lucy and Edmund, 
     and then all four of the kids make their way through an attic 
     wardrobe in Narnia, a magical land of mythical creatures and 
     talking animals. But Narnia is not perfect: it's always winter and 
     never Christmas since the White Witch began her rule. And there are 
     evil creatures as well as good, and a traitor in their midst. Only 
     the return of Aslan can bring victory in the coming battle to win 
     spring and freedom back to Narnia
