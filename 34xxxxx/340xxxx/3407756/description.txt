?How Heysel Changed Football?, a DoubleBand Films? production for Channel 4 and RTE, has been shown on Channel 4, as part of its Explosive 80s strand.
This powerful new documentary revisited the Heysel Stadium disaster of May 1985, when 39 fans were crushed to death before the European Cup Final between Liverpool FC and Juventus, and explored how the tragedy plunged English football into a crisis from which was born the
modern English game.
