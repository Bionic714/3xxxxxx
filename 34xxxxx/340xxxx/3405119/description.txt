Earth Rising The Series Vol. #2
Technologies in the 21st Century

Technologies that will transform our lives are advancing rapidly raising
serious questions about privacy, safety and their proper uses. Military
planners and others are attempting to use these breakthroughs to create
a more directed and controlled society while ignoring the positive
applications of many of these new discoveries. This video delivers an
overview and update on the HAARP material, cell phones, privacy,
underwater sonars other areas of technology. The challenges these new
technologies present will shape the nature of freedom and liberty in
ways never contemplated in the past. Systems have been developed which
will have far reaching effects on the environment, human health and the
direction of free people. The DVD includes discussion intended to
stimulate debate and while educating the public on these pressing issues
of the 21st century.

This volume is much more info based and no products being explained/sold.
Great HAARP update & basic info. Large section on privacy concerns with
cell phone tracking RFID chips and other police state/marketing tool
surveillance technologies. Also some talk about Sonar and other magnetic
field/electric pollution. Overall I found it to be harder hitting then
the 1st one though perhaps not as positive (1st one had positive tech use
this on is more about fear of bad use). This will be all of this series
for now until the next ones are released, Cheers & Enjoy.
