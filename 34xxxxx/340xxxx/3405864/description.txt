OfficePoltergeist is open source windows computer prank software.

Install the OfficePoltergeist server on a victim's computer and you can take possession of it. Use OfficePoltergeist to:

    * Play spooky sounds
    * Open or close cd drives
    * Transmit text through your victim's keyboard
    * Make windows shake
    * Turn monitors on and off
    * Move windows slightly left and right
    * Send popup alert messages

OFFICEPOLTERGEIST IS NOT SPYWARE.

While OfficePoltergeist does allow you to take limited control of another person's computer, it does not allow remote users to read data or execute potentially harmful commands.

The goal is to be obnoxious, but not destructive.

OfficePoltergeist does not install itself or remain in memory after the game is over. While the OfficePoltergeist server does run as stealthily as it can to avoid the victim's attention, OfficePoltergeist is totally gone when the user restarts his or her machine. 

Source code is available for OfficePoltergeist.
