,decebal01us,2008-04-06T11:55Z,Dose eny one know where i can find a crack for a patched  sw battlefront 2 1.1
,Kooshy,2009-04-22T03:28Z,"It worked for me, but not quite how I expected. I got the same error other people seemed to (about the required security resource), at first...but then I tried it with just the cracked .exe file (and not the virtual-dvd-hide app) and it worked like a charm.

And..thanks for this! I bought this game years ago and have been rather enjoying it..until recently when I installed Alcohol 52% and the game's crappy copy protection stopped recognizing the LEGALLY PURCHASED disc in the ACTUAL drive, just because virtual drives EXIST on the machine. 

I'm getting to the point where I wonder why I throw my money away to buy games when the crappy anti-piracy software that's loaded on 'em won't let me play 'em..but the cracked ones from on here seem to work the first time (or close) every time. :D

And yeah, thanks a ton. ^^"
,SMSStevenz,2010-03-14T07:49Z,"dude it says everytime i m goin on the star wars battlefront II.exe , binkw32.dll was not found"
,c130260,2010-05-28T07:07Z,"I FIGURED IT OUT!!!!  BOTH BINKW32.DLL AND ""INSERT SWBF2 ORIGINAL DISC""

*All these steps are to be performed AFTER game is installed on hard drive*

1. explore the ISO via your mounted drive and copy the ""battlefrontII.exe"".  Paste that in the folder ""C:\Program Files\LucasArts\Star Wars Battlefront II"" or wherever you have your game.

2. then ALSO paste it to ""C:\Program Files\LucasArts\Star Wars Battlefront II\GameData""  

3. In the GameData file copy the binkw32.dll and paste that into ""C:\Program Files\LucasArts\Star Wars Battlefront II"" 

4. Run the cracked file ""battlefrontII"" from C:\Program Files\LucasArts\Star Wars Battlefront II.

5. You will be able to launch the game from the UNCRACKED file ""LaunchBFII""

Took me some time to figure it out, but this worked perfectly for me."
,GergIn8oR,2011-05-05T04:37Z,works just fine for me!
,rocker210,2011-08-16T10:30Z,for dummies here right click the readme or .nfo file then open with... and select notepad and click ok.nfo say are corrupt but use notepad to open
,bay_area,2011-12-27T19:31Z,"my problem is that im not using an iso, i bought the actual game years ago, but because of the shitty copy protection, it gives me ""A required security module cannot be activated. This program cannot be executed."" so far, this hasn't worked, and the Battlefront2.exe file is actually exactly the same as the original. it isn't cracked in any way"
