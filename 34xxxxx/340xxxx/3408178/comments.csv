,Klokka2,2006-03-28T12:56Z,"Do this and it should work fine: 

Make sure your clock/date is 2006 . (check it) 

Change these settings to: 

TSR Disabel 

In Game Reset Off (U can still use the reset) 

Save and exit 

If this does not work. Put Game region to default/auto (i use default) 

Now all my games work

,rdn404,2007-03-11T10:27Z,"Guyz listen to me how make this work

This iso have a fucked layer so you have
unpack iso as folder on pc using a tool called CloneXB

Now you will got the correct files on sub folder,
build a new iso or send file to hdd via FTP

This game works in my xbox NTSC

REPEAT: DONT BURN AFTER UNRAR

REBUILD THE ISO USING CLONEXB

IF YOU SEND ORIGINAL ISO TO DVD O HDD
YOU WILL GOT 3 SCREWED FILES

Thanks for the uploading!!!
