,robothax,2007-08-15T23:11Z,"I've begun seeding it.  It's a fun anime, I hope you all enjoy it as much as I am. (I prefer the first subtitler over the second, to be honest, but they both translate very well.)"
,SwedishFrog,2007-11-23T22:59Z,"Im having a really bloody annoying problem. I started downloading this torrent about a day and a half ago and all went well untill I had about 87.5 %. Since then ( about 6 hours ago ) the download started to suddenly STOP. 
Like this: I had about 87.5 then when I had 87.9 it just stopped and went back to 87.5 and I got an errormessage that said the following: ""Error: You cant access ths file because its being used by another process"".
I rebooted by laptop, started the download again but the problem STILL remains! I now have 91.3% and I want HELP cuz it goes to 91.6 then the errormessage shows up. Can SOMEONE please tell me what the hell is going on?!!"
