Hi, these files are missing in my tonys hawk in america release, this is because some files where renamed by dvd2xbox becuase some files names are too long (42 characters or longer I think), this make the game crash in "Find the Skate Club Boss" Mission in Beverly Hills and maybe in further missions, so here are the files with the instructions, please let me know if work for you, it works for me
