,paleck,2006-02-01T18:02Z,A GSM is the same as an ISO. Just change the name to .iso and burn it
,starfish_1,2006-05-03T18:12Z,I don´t find a CD to burn it on. A normal CD is to big to fit in. Where can I get a gamecubeCD?
,sajon,2006-05-22T01:58Z,"It's just ""normal"" mini-dvd. 8cm's dvds.  But you could buy a replacement kit so it could take normal dvds..  But you still need to install a mod-chip as well.."
,jarret08,2006-07-22T12:42Z,"I burndes allready serveral GCM images as iso and all of them work, but this one here wont? Any Idea?"
,lopas1,2006-07-28T11:09Z,"If it is a .gsm file this works with emulators!

Of all the NGC emulators i think the dolwin is the most userfriendly, but slowest!

Whinecube i like the most it isn't hard to start games or change some of the controlls.

It runs fast is the best choise would i say

All Emulators:

Dolphin:http://www.emulator-zone.com/doc.php/gamecube/dolphin.html

(Error machine(Not for all))

GCEmu:http://www.emulator-zone.com/doc.php/gamecube/gcemu.html

(i haven't tried it)

Dolwin:http://www.emulator-zone.com/doc.php/gamecube/dolwin.html

(slow as hell, but user friendly)

WhineCube:http://www.emulator-zone.com/doc.php/gamecube/whinecube.html

(Best choise(For me atleast))

Gcube:http://www.emulator-zone.com/doc.php/gamecube/gcube.html

(Don't remember(LOL))"

anyone having problems with this one?"
,bigballss,2007-07-15T09:23Z,For all the noobies out there.  Use a DVD-R and burn it onto the disc and insert it into the wii and play.  simple. easy. and quick.
,Winterpirate,2007-10-23T16:11Z,"AgentNuts - ""wii sucks anyway... lol omfg enjoy your crap graphics and stupid ps2 ports! for 5 - 10 years dumbass""

games aint all about graphics. its a mostly about entertainment. and i must say that i think the wii games that nintendo makes got a bit more soul and charm then other console games. but thats just my appinion anyway..."

,Spy_Kob,2008-02-26T20:52Z,"Wii med Wiikey 1.9g

Brände spelet på en vanlig dvd-r skiva. Funkade först inte så jag stoppade in setup 1.3 skivan (stoppa in GCOS först om inte setup 1.3 funkar) sen så ändrade jag ""region overdrive"" och så vips så funkar det. Behöver naturligtvis GC kontroller. Mycket roligt spel.
Tx for the upload, nice work: PALECK"

[T],rand0mher0z,2009-02-17T05:44Z,"I don't know what all you guys are talking about. I downloaded, unrared, renamed to .iso, and then burned using ImgBurn at 2.4x and it worked perfect 1st time. Im using WiiGators 0.1 Backup Loader Theta, so if it works on that I imagine that it will work with any modchip."

,MitsEvX,2010-03-11T18:49Z,Thanks! It works in Dolphin on 30 FPS!
,kingboomy,2010-12-09T05:39Z,Actually there is a Wii softmod you can do that allows you to play burned wii and GC games. I'm running it beautifly. it takes about 15 minutes and maybe some patience if you dunno what version of the OS you have.

,papisho,2012-04-21T19:41Z,Of course you don't need a modchip to play it on Wii. you can just softmod and use an sd or usb. It's easy.
,GothBoy8,2012-07-02T10:23Z,"I can't get this to work on Dolphin. I changed it to an ISO file, then I opened it with Dolphin and I get sound but no video just a blank screen. Any ideas?"
