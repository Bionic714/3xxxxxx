,Harry Q Hammer,2008-04-06T18:33Z,"Thank you 'the_lone_gunman' for your totally and utterly useless post!  Please don't bother!

For those who want useful information:

There is only one duplicated file, not two.

The file ""Mr Bean 5 - Mr Bean Rides Again.avi"" is actually a duplicate of the file ""Mr Bean 4 - Mr Bean Goes To Town.avi"".

Therefore, download the following torrent and use it to replace the file ""Mr Bean 5 - Mr Bean Rides Again.avi"":

Ta dah!

There are some sets of subtitles for the series on opensubtitles and subscene, but they don't match these rips. Yes, I know there isn't much dialog, but I'd like them all the same."
