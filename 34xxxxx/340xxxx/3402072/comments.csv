,paddywack,2006-11-14T09:24Z,how do i open these? thanks
,DeMandolorian,2007-03-18T15:40Z,You can dl a program called CDisplay that loads the comic up like a pic viewer.
,Wiffleballs,2007-06-02T23:13Z,"CDisplay is great, thanks a million."
,Tetsuo0920,2008-06-11T23:40Z,"Also, I use another program called Comical."
,thund3rstruck,2008-08-17T05:01Z,"Nah, forget CDisplay; go get ComicRack or ComicReaderX. ComicRack is the cream of the crop, period. Nothing out there can touch it. "
,cschex89,2008-10-04T17:35Z,If you're on Mac you can try FFView.  It's freeware and looks great. 
,Termina,2008-11-06T22:09Z,"Linux users can use comix; a really good comic book reader (supports .zip, .cbr, .rar, etc)"
,DeadCats,2008-11-23T14:59Z,"You're missing The Hard Goodbye. This is a dope torrent, I have the series physically but now I can read them any time any where without worrying about butchering the comic."
,J_Bak3r_89,2008-12-18T15:15Z,"Lovin the torrent man!


Seed please :)"
,wqutob,2009-07-08T18:44Z,"sin city (original story)/(Violent Marv) is The Hard Goodbye.

the only thing missing from the list skojhyddan gave is booze broads and bullets.

other then that it's a pretty kick ass torrent."
,gwie_01,2009-12-13T12:16Z,"Been searching like crazy in what order i should read them. Seems like that's the first post. :D

Thanks a lot!"
,grakh,2010-10-17T18:33Z,"BTW: booze broad and bullets is a collection of short stories from the other albums, no new yarns.

See 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Sin_City_yarns
for more information"
,The77s,2011-02-08T18:12Z,"Instead of downloading CDisplay, ComicRack, Comical or any of the others, you could just change the .cbr to .rar then extract them, then read.

That's what I done."
,guilliaume,2011-04-08T06:58Z,"This torrent is complete! The ""Booze, Broads and Bullets"" is just a compilation of the shorter ones, namely:
- Silent Night
- The Babe Who Wore Red & Other Stories
- Lost, Lonely & Lethal
- Family Values
- Just Another Saturday Night
- Sex and Violence

This is a good read. :D "
,GothBoy8,2012-06-23T16:26Z,"Thank you so much, this is my favorite Comic series of all time. And the film is a master piece. "
