While past Castlevania games have focused on the struggle between Dracula and the Belmont clan, Curse of Darkness introduces players to an entirely new storyline and main character ? Hector, a Devil Forgemaster, and former Lieutenant of Dracula. Told in true Castlevania style by award winning producer Koji Igarashi, this action-packed tale of betrayal and revenge takes players on a journey through an expansive world filled with formidable foes and beautifully rendered environments to the ruins of Dracula?s castle.
