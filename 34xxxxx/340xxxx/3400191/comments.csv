,antiterrorstyrkan,2006-04-30T18:44Z,"yes yes, I probably will later on. the problem is that the add-pop up thing is so annoying that you cant bare to really live with the OS for any prolonged time. (wich is what testing an OS is all about) :) they shuld have made it like a banner on the screen or aomething att login instead. still, I like what little Ive seen of it thus far. "
