from wikipedia:

12 oz. Mouse Spider-Man Special
Episode number: 104b
Original airdate: November 6, 2005

This is an alternate version of ""Spider"" with several scenes shortened and Skillet's drum solo added in. Rhoda and Shark's conversation is cut down, thus removing Golden Joe's appearance, Mosquitor's letter was cut down and the dripping blood was removed, and Shark's conversation with Fitz about the record is shortened to ""Don't look under your bed."" These cuts made room for an extended drum solo which went on for several minutes.

This special aired directly following the premiere of the standard version of ""Spider.""

This episode has yet to be aired a second time."
