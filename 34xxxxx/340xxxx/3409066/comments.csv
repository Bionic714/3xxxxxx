,Joka2006,2006-04-30T21:19Z,"here's your info - this is a very cheap game that is basically your ultimate free-time-waster. it's pretty much awesome. there is a free version, but it doesn't have the deluxe weapons and stuff. it's pretty sweet, we played it all the time at school when the teachers werent paying attention. i didn't know there was a mac release until now - someone seed please!"
