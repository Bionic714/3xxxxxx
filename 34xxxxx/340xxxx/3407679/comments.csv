,pontiff,2007-04-06T09:26Z,can ANYONE report that it DOES work with the cables suggested in the original post? or anywhere else to get a decent quality set of cables?
,j0hn,2007-07-06T13:55Z,"ive downloaded it and followed the instructions in the crack file.

replace existing MB.exe and MBHLP.exe with these ones and then copy CARSOFT.exe to your installation
folder. now you can delete CARSOFT65BMW.exe it is not needed any more.

but i still get a copy protection 213. has any1 got this to work. i've alright got a carsoft interface box from ebay."

,BjornT,2008-01-20T16:27Z,"i also get a ""path too long"" error message, when installing the program. After following the crack install. i tryed to start the program via the program icon, so u can use the carsoft menu, it says the program is not completly installed. But when using carsoft app icon it will start. Do one of u know what this means? is it working or not?

PS. I havent got the cabel ""kit"" yet. Is this causing the prob?

Wanted to make shure if it works before spending money on a ""cable"" that in the long run i can just throw out"

Thanks"
,plouat,2008-07-10T14:03Z,"Hi all

The ""path too long"" error message on carsoft 6.5 is a common issue, but believe that your copy works well. The path too long error message is not caused by the install location (destination directory) wich is ""c:\program files\carsoft\bmw"", but by the source directory. In my case, the install files were in a folder named carsoft, but the folder was on my desktop, wich means that the install files were located on ""c:\documents and settings\username\desktop\carsoft\"". This path is too long for setup application to process it, knowing that the install files (setup.exe for instance) should be located on the root directory (X:\). So my advice is : Throw the install files on a cd, root directory.

Install and enjoy Carsoft, Sisters and Brothers "
,Sempai-mj,2008-08-19T23:05Z,MIne works for the live Data but when I try to run the diagnostics the program bombs.
,craigspeedy,2008-11-13T06:43Z,"All as this prgram is a access to the cars GRE, you cant control any modules. Some adaptions can be reset and some cant. Nether the less you can always try a hard reset on the car to reset adaptions. I would stick with a hand held before using this on my BMW. "
,driftspin,2009-04-06T23:56Z,"7.3 is out, is there a work around for the dongle?
