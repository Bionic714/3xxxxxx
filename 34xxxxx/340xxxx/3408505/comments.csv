I had the first book, but lost it many years ago... time to restart this awesome collection!

,jherrmann,2011-05-30T03:33Z,"Brilliant, thanks. I've got the hard copies but want to be able to read them on the Kindle as well. :)

The first two series have multiple formats, and a couple of them have covers. The first book of the final series is included but only in text format. Nice compilation though."

Keep in mind this was uploaded in 2005 long before epub/mobi was popular. =)

There are websites that can do html/txt to epub/mobi however for free, and of course nook/kindle can read pdf already."
