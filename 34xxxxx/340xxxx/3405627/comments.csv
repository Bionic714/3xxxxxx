,r1ch,2007-08-27T23:37Z,"why doesnt anyone comment after they open the file... is this a good dl or not?

does it work with all emu's? are all the games one file or split up like some others do?"
,Jazz_at_Dawn,2008-12-22T01:29Z,"Dude include a fucking list to show what's included, or at least a sampling of the shit that people will be interested in....FFS!"
,_DocT_,2008-12-27T22:18Z,"Awesome Download, Awesome Speed, KEEP SEEDING>>>GREAT JOB!!!"
,Pfft,2009-01-08T21:10Z,"Jazz_at_Dawn: The torrent name speaks for it self, its easier to make a list of whatÂ´s not included.
Deleting the torrent is also easy, so STFU MORON!"
,ceebitt,2009-01-10T04:16Z,"Oh yeah not just a few...
Maxximum respect to this hard work you spent for getting all these files together... I opened it and couldnt stop reading... Seeded it for half a day!"
,ummwat,2010-03-07T22:37Z,What's with all these fucking huge ROM packs..?
,dargonhuman,2010-06-08T04:49Z,"ummwat, would you rather download dozens of torrents and weeding through duplicate ROM files or get them all in one torrent, without having to delete the duplicates?
I know what MY answer would be..."
,xgroovy,2011-08-15T08:59Z,awesome torrent! unfortunatelly i was wondering why are there many files in every game title?
