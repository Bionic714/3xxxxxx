,WeeGit,2008-03-05T00:00Z,"And so you comment on it... why? Just for the sake of being a dick? Really, you need to show a little bit more self restraint there boyo."
,tknicol,2008-03-30T04:41Z,"Thank you for this.  
And for the disser of the band, why would you even make some stupid comment about a torrent you're so obviously not going to d/l?  "

,drook,2008-05-27T07:48Z,"only the 2005 is in proper quality, all others are in 128/160 kbps, which in modern environmemt can be considered as an analogue of camcoder copy of a film, but in a audio world.

anyway, thanks. "
