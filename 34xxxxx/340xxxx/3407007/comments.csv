@coilleach just a question: are you saying that Chris Cornell's voice ""hasn't got enough volume"" in general, or just on this dvd release? I'm curious because he's famous for how well (and loud) he can sing!! "
,ZenRhino,2009-09-03T21:16Z,"@thiagoXtreme:

The title says this is the entire show, it doesn't say it's the full DVD with the documentary footage. I say this is worth getting. For those interested, here's the 18 song set list spanning Rage Against The Machine, Soundgarden and Audioslave:

Set it Off
Your time Has Come
Like A Stone
Spoonman
The Worm
Gasoline
Heaven's Dead
Doesn't Remind Me
Be Yourself
Bulls on Parade (instrumental)
Sleep Now in The Fire
Out of Exile
Outshined
Shadow of the Sun
Black Hole Sun (Chris Cornell solo)
I am the Highway
Show Me How To Live
Cochise"
