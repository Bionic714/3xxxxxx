May 2005, Audioslave made international headlines by becoming the first American rock band to ever perform in U.S.-embargoed Cuba. More than 60,000 screaming fans stormed Havana's Anti-Imperialist Plaza to catch the May 6th show and the band gave an absolutely electrifying performance, tearing through a free two-and-a-half hour show. The historic event is captured on the Epic/Interscope release LIVE IN CUBA, a deluxe 18-song double-disc package that includes a DVD featuring a 30-minute documentary, live concert footage and an additional TV special on the event, along with a bonus live CD taken from Audioslave's recent AOL Sessions performance.
