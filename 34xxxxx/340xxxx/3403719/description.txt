Here it is! Full Season 5 of Celebrity Poker Showdown.

It was pretty hard to get actually.

I'm going to upload Season 6 after this one too. **BUT** .. I'm missing the final game of that season (S06E06) ... So I need that one badly.

S07 is still on AIR in the U.S so I'm on the hunt for those too ....

But for now, enjoy Season 5! Jason Alexander is in this season!! You know, George Costanza from Seinfeld ;).
