,Tyki,2008-11-13T10:40Z,"Just downloaded the first three episodes in this torrent and they work great.

Video - 10
Sound - 10

Oh and no, they are not out of sync.

People really need to start using crappy media players and just install KM Player, it also contains every vido codec so you'll never get any problems.

Use it dudes, trust me. "
,Tyki,2008-11-13T10:41Z,"LMAO, i meant to say - 

People really need to STOP using crappy media players."
,MahBoff,2009-03-05T00:38Z,"Ep 1 is only out of sync by about 100ms (add it, don't subtract it). I've downloaded the 1st 2 eps and other than above, the quality is fine! 

Thanks! I hope you upped the other seasons as well (looking now)."
,Varinia,2010-02-07T21:28Z,thnx for the up
,jmb1212,2011-04-07T14:55Z,amazing download speed :) 
,Sit3UserX,2011-04-25T21:28Z,"No out of sync at all. I have downloaded and watched the entire season with no problem. If you have problem with codecs, stop using Windows Media Player. Try apps like Daum PotPlayer, The KMPlayer, GOMPlayer or VLC.

A/V = 10/10"
,emilygrace93,2012-06-12T08:18Z,A10 V10 a little out of sync but that can be fixed
