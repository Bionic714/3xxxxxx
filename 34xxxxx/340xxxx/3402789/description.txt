ITVV B747: Heathrow - Kai Tak
-----------------------------

http://www.itvv.co.uk/cpab747400dvd.asp

ABSOLUTE MUST HAVE!

Starts with a Cathay 747-400 takeoff from Heathrow with Cpt. Don Grange doing all the explaining. This is followed by an extensive simulator session. The best part is saved for the end - a hand flown landing at Kai Tak, Hong Kong. The landing is a multi camera shoot with both external and cockpit views. 

Informative and entertaining at the same time. The best aviation video I've seen, ever.

Codec - DivX/MP3

Runtime - 1 Hour

Comments - Excellent video quality, slight off spec aspect ratio easily corrected using FFDShow's display filters. Also recommend same for de-interlacing.

Enjoy!
