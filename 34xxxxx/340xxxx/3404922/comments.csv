,choppy255,2011-05-15T00:14Z,how do i play it with dolphin
,BMeyers94,2012-02-16T06:49Z,"First thing is first, great upload paleck. Runs with Dolphin at 100% speed, 30 FPS, and 60 VPS. Nothing is wrong with this file at all.

Second, for this game to run, you have to have a strong computer. I have an Acer Aspire 5750-6845. It has . . .

An Intel Core i5-2430M 2.4GHz with Turbo Boost up to 3.0GHz

Intel HD Graphics 3000, up to 1760 MB Dynamic Video Memory

8 GB DDR3 Memory

So I have a very strong laptop. Anyways, if you computer can handle the Dolphin emulator, all you have to do is extract all the .rar files in this torrent to a single file. Highlight all of the .rar files and right click and click on ""Extract to Pokemon Colosseum/"". Given that you have a program like WinRAR installed.

After you extract everything you should have a folder at the top of the folder that has all of the .rar files in it that says Pokemon Colosseum and in it should be a file that says ""Pokemon Colosseum.gmc"" That's what you want.

Go ahead and run Dolphin. I believe the latest version is 3.0 ? But anyways, run Dolphin and click on the ""File"" drop down menu in the top left and then click ""Open"".

Navigate to the ""Pokemon Colosseum.gmc"" file and open it.

If your computer is beast enough, the file should run just fine. If not, the game might be a little laggy. I'd recommend at least 4 GB of RAM and an Intel i5 Processor with DDR3 graphics.

As for Gamecube Backup Launcher, I haven't messed with it in awhile. I had it up and running on my hacked Wii on 3.4 I believe ? It ran great. I burned it to a DVD using ImgBurn and got in running on one of the versions of the Backup Launcher. I wanna say Xi or something ? It's been a minute. I do remember having to editing the settings of the boot so the screen didn't go retarded. 

Anymore questions just ask !

,silentswordsman,2012-05-26T15:05Z,i have a 500 gb computer and i still have problems sometimes the most i had was a problem with gale of darkness where the game ran so slow that it took forever to get anything done
