If it hurts Fredrika's lesbian ego to see women dating both, too bad. If only people would simply go by what the actual film shows and says, instead of reading crazed interpretations into it.

All cockblockery aside, this is far from Kevin Smith's best film, but definitely has its moments. However, if you are a fundamentalist conservative, a die-hard lesbian, or just plain don't like ""love conquers all""-theme movies, you'll probably hate it. Otherwise, get your popcorn, soda, and enjoy the movie...if somebody will ever seed it, that is..."
