Star Wars Battlefront II takes the best-selling Star Wars video game of all time one Imperial-walker step 
forward with all-new space combat, playable Jedi, and never-before-seen environments straight out of the 
Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith film. Fans of the original Star Wars Battlefront will also 
enjoy an all-new single-player experience that takes players through an epic, story-based saga where 
every action the player takes impacts the battlefront and, ultimately, the fate of the Star Wars galaxy. 
Critically acclaimed Pandemic Studios is once again developing the game for LucasArts.
