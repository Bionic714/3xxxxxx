"Since their genesis in 2002, THE BIG SOUND has crafted a unique style by blending the vintage sounds of early Jamaican popular music into the contemporary southern California music scene. The result is a mixture of original rocksteady, reggae, dub and ska that brings a fresh take on traditional sounds of the Golden Era of Jamaican music ('66-'73).

THE BIG SOUND independently recorded and released their first album, Stand So Tall, in April 2004. The album has eleven original tracks that bring a breath of fresh air to California reggae. Among other things, the album showcases the band's reverence for the early Jamaican artists like Ken Boothe, Desmond Dekker, John Holt, and many others. Since its release, the band has been playing consistently in San Diego and Los Angeles and are currently working on a 2005 tour schedule and plans for another album."
