[V],snajp3r,2006-01-06T13:28Z,"Downloading now, I'll tell you how to get it to work, I think I know this stuff...
BTW: Don't EVER buy a game with a copy protection. A defect CD/DVD is even more useless than the pirated version..."

If you want to play 1.2 this is the download you've been looking for (unless you wanna pay for it)."
