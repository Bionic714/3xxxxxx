:-)"
,Nicartos,2006-04-17T02:05Z,"I found out what the matter is. The game is missing file game01.pk4 from the base folder. If anyone has that file, I would greatly appreciate it if they would upload it. Thanks."
,Nicartos,2006-04-17T02:12Z,Ignore that last comment. Drag the doom icon from the crack folder and replace the toast file with it. It will work fine then.
,bbboy,2006-04-19T17:35Z,"Hey guys. I've never tried to run downloaded games for MAC before. I have a Mac Mini using the Intel core duo. After I've downloaded it, what steps need to be taken? Thanks for any help! (PS. A link to some HOWTO would be fine too :))"

,dsauna,2006-05-03T17:05Z,"I got it you just have to follow bbvasb and Nicartos instructions(thank you to you guys)

1. Inside of doom 3 for mac double click on domm_3 toast, after that just drag the doom 3 folder to your desktop

2. double click on the doom crack again inside of doom 3 for mac, and replace the doom icon that is here for the one that is in you desktop

3. double click the game, it asks you for a serial, go to www.serialz.to. Search for doom 3 mac, put that code in the box, and you are ready to go"

,The Aceman,2007-04-10T11:58Z,"Here's how you get the sound to work. 

1. Open garageband
2. Press Command K to bring up the keyboard
3. Play a few notes on the keyboard
4. Quit garageband
5. Run Doom III, your sound should work.

I know it sounds crazy but it works."

,Zaknaberrnon,2008-06-15T22:34Z,"Hey, When I write the CD key in the thing, it tells me that the key is already in use. I have the 1.3.1 Rev A update installed, and have the game cracked. I have tried writing the ""33agl7capabawslh 7d"" key a couple of time, so i didn't spell it wrong. I guess It's because some extremely smart person registered their bootleg copy. thanks a lot to that stupid person. could someone PLEASE tell me a different key for 1.3?"
,iSlayer,2008-09-22T00:35Z,"Wtf. I just downloaded 1.5 gigs worth of crap. I double clicked the toast file. I copied all the stuff to my HD and opened the crack. I double click the crack, it quickly exists after popping up. I double click the Doom III game, it quickly closes after popping up.

What the hell do I have to do to get Doom 3 on my Macbook (Intel) w/ Leopard."
,stevesuomi,2008-10-18T11:57Z,"Does anyone know a solution to the black screen at start up problem?

,Davidmb5,2009-02-10T04:36Z,"Does the game work or not, has anyone gotten it to play with audio and video and work good."
,eewah,2010-10-14T08:42Z,"Hi guys, don't know if you still need this, But, I found a way to make the sound work. 

First go into the utilities folder which is located in your applications folder.

Open up Audio MIDI setup.

Then select Built in output, Source: internal speakers (if you're using a MacBook) than under format choose 44100.0 Hz ( if it isint already set to that) and also select: 2ch-16 bit from the pull down menu.

Worked for me hope it works for you :D"

,rsl87,2011-03-17T19:35Z,Can't get this to work for me either. Gone through all the comments and tried everything so far. I click on the game to open it and it just won't open :(
,Tsumego,2011-04-09T17:05Z,"Okay, here's how you make it work (since some guys doesn't seem to be able to find stuff by themselves)...

1. Open both .dmg files. There's one called nodvdcrack and the other is the ""normal"" doom3 file.
2. Copy the doom3 folder in your Hard Disk.
3. Open the nodvdcrack thing (the black moon you should see on your desktop)
4. Drag the Doom3 launcher from the nodvdcrack in the doom3 folder you just copied.
5. A message will pop-out asking you if you wanna replace the file. Say yes.
6. Open the newly copied Doom3 launcher
7. Enter the code (33agl7capabawslh 7d) in the box
8. The game opens up, you got sound, everything's fine.

Thx a lot for this game, Sunal. You're awesome"
,m_slizzard,2011-06-10T06:04Z,"^^ did everything above comment said, got sound but no visuals. screen went black and stayed black.... any help?"
,guitarjoa,2011-07-06T23:23Z,"Works great! Just install and replace the launcher with the one in the nodvd crack. I had to install Rosetta first (well, my mac did it for me), then I entered the code 33agl7capabawslh 7d, and PLAY! Thanks."
,Knukkohead,2011-11-02T16:42Z,"did everything like dsauna said, when i launch it the screen blinks with light blue colour for a second, then turns black, no sound no nothing, any ideas?"
