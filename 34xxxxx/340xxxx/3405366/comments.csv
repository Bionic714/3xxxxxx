,4365nokb6,2006-07-22T16:42Z,"A 'bin/cue' combo is to be burned to a cd.  However, there are programs like 'PowerISO' that can 'mount' the bin/cue' combo.  To 'mount' is to make the computer think the bin/cue combo is really in a cd drive.  PowerISO lies to the OS, the OS believes there is a new cdrom drive and presents the contens of the bin/cue as a cd in a new cd drive.  Lastly,  WinRAR and PowerISO can, sometimes, 'extract' all files from the bin/cue' into a new folder. GL"
,phlip,2006-07-24T03:49Z,"I'm not that much of a noob, but thanks for trying to help.  Absolutely all of the files are .bin files, no .cue files and they're all small, average about 3.50mbyte.  I have alcohol 120% and mount images to virtual drives all the time, i love it for mounting cd images then open itunes, and not have to burn a cd."
