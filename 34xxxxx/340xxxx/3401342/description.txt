Age of empire 3 working on all windows except windows 3.11...  I really hate MS.


Ok if you dont trust this package, go buy windows xp, I garanteed this package doesnt have any virus, trojan, or other stuff like that, its only and only the game.

I did a lot of good package (like the sims 8 in 1, startcraft + broodwar + stuff, etc) and I always have good comment on that.


This package will give you the ability to install Age of Empire 3 on any windows, with a NO CD CRACK include in the installation, so you dont have to own any real cd.

Sometime people need to download the lastest directx from www.microsoft.com/directx , my package will not install this for you, you have to do that manually.

Have fun
