Don't you find it amazing that the US is the main country that's worried about everyone else having nuclear weapons and ironically, the US is the only country in the world to have used nuclear weapons on it's enemies, not once, but TWICE? Your perhaps just a skinhead, racist, Nazi devil anyway."

While your dealing with the guilt of us using a nuke to win a war that some say we were close to losing in the pacific, ask yourself, would Japan have done the same to L.A. or New York if they had the bomb? I'll save you some time thinking; you bet your ass they would've.

But then again, you're not ""thinking,"" you're ""feeling."""
