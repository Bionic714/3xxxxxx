It's an 8 minute film, encoded in QuickTime.  That's 1024kb/s bitrate, 550x234 widescreen format.  I can just about guarantee you 100% this will be far superior to the YouTube version!

Thanks for the correction about the car he was driving."

It is more than likely that the audio has been overdubbed from, as has been suggested here, the Ferrari 275 GT/B. I'm not saying this is the wrong audio for the film, it isn't, just that the audio in the film doesn't belong to the car being driven."

Quote: According to recent claims by Claude Lelouch, he was driving his own Mercedes in the film, and later dubbed over the sound of a Ferrari 275GTB to give the impression of much higher speeds."
