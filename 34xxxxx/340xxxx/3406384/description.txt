Director Claude Lelouch, after filming a movie in Paris, found he had 10 minutes left of film. He then challenged a friend to drive from Porte Dauphine, through the Louvre, to the Basilica of Sacre Coeur (a trip that can take up to an hour in rush-hour traffic) without running out of film. He strapped the gyroscopically stabalized camera to the hood of his Ferrari 275 GT/B, mounted a microphone to the engine, and away he went.  No streets were closed. No permits were granted. Those are real red lights, real cars and real pedestrians. Upon first showing the video, Lelouch was promptly arrested by the French authorities, and the film went underground. This is the remastered version from the original 35mm print.  He has still refused to name the driver.

This makes the "Getaway in Stockholm" series look like a lazy drive in the country.
