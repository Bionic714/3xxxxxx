Thanks malcx for the torrent. Thanks to the lone seeder too!"
,JimNoddy,2006-02-18T03:54Z,"It works, but unfortunately lacks the CD audio.  Shame, really, since half the reason I downloaded this was for the excellent soundtrack."

I think EA games own the rights for this game series since they bought the Bullfrog company. (I think :o) 

And since they dont sell these games anymore I dont think there is a way for them to profit of the game anymore.. But a lot of ppl here downloads games and if they like them they buy them. 

And Torrent websites like TPB are great for Game creators to get some honest free feedback on the games they have craeted, so I think they do check these forums..

Great game but i'll cry myself to sleep for not getting the sound :("
,radax,2006-09-07T21:01Z,Does this work or what?

,Verwandlung-,2006-11-16T13:45Z,use dosbox and dfend to play this game in XP
,Drowlord,2007-12-04T00:20Z,"I've actually purchased two legal copies of this game, but can't find either, anymore.  I also remember the original syndicate and the expansion on my Amiga.

Of course... this one is 11 years old, and I've moved 4 times since it was in stores."
,Jon_humphreys,2008-01-06T14:18Z,"Hey Malcx, thanks much for syndicate and swars. I was looking on the net and looked on wikipedia and found firstly this nifty fan site http://syndicate.lubie.org/ and second a new version is being made but it is open source so not made by bullfrog http://freesynd.sourceforge.net/
I would like to see this game made 3D and have the ability to switch between strategy and FPS like bullfrog did so well with the dungeon keeper 2."
,BiReal,2008-08-16T22:48Z,"Anyone out there?.. I used DOSBOX and mounted the install path, installation loaded but when i tried to install the game it said ""Cant write FILE"".  
any ideas.?"
,civic27,2009-08-16T18:46Z,HOW DO U SAVE???
,grable,2010-01-27T05:07Z,"Check this out, no more need for dosbox of you dont want to.

,jemdem,2010-02-14T12:27Z,"this game is an abandonware, you can (securely)  direct download it from abandonware sites..."
