,secretkosinski,2008-09-02T00:30Z,"i downloaded this and it plays great, but i want to put it on dvd using dvdSanta. dvdSanta shuts down every time without warning - I think it might be because the audio is AC3, not PCM like other movies I've seen. any ideas? "

,erynmj,2009-07-31T01:21Z,"Please remove the wording ""Texted Language(s): ENGLISH"" from this torrent so that people don't think they are getting subtitles when they ARE NOT. "
,atleast,2009-08-21T18:53Z,subtitles work just fine (with vlc)
,atleast,2009-08-21T18:53Z,"and yeah, Doghouse Riley - thanks a lot for this!"

,TeflonMan,2010-02-14T04:16Z,Très rapide. J'ai téléchargé ce dans dix minutes. =)
,prasnto,2010-05-25T09:53Z,"The English subtitles in this torrent work fine (and are perfectly in-sync to boot). 

I can only surmise that the two dimwits complaining about there not being subtitles do not know how to use them. In which case the prudent option would have been to do a web search for 'how do I load srt subs', instead of assuming that it is the torrent that is flawed."
,nitintd,2011-04-04T07:32Z,"hi to all film hunters.....the subtiles are working fine in my media player. its a very great film by one of the new french wave directors. thanxxxxxxxxxxxxx a lot and as regarding meg7m, indians never watch classic movies. they would like to watch some freaks movies like amitabh or amir khan"
,nitintd,2011-04-04T07:33Z,hi to all film hunters.....the subtiles are working fine in my media player. its a very great film by one of the new french wave directors. thannx a lot

,sexualsinner,2011-11-28T13:26Z,*****NO ENGLISH SUBTITLES
,toneva,2012-06-21T16:46Z,"*** The subtitles work PERFECTLY

If they aren't working for you, it's because you're stupid and not using VLC."
