Stylish and sexy, ?BREATHLESS? (A Bout De Souffle) is the epitome of cinematic cool. A fast tale of a young man on the run in Paris at the end of the 50?s, the film shook up the film world upon it?s release and has made a lasting impression on cinema history.

Cigarettes, hats, sunglasses and determined unconformity make Michel Pjenkaard (Jean-Paul Belmondo) a true cinematic icon. Playing against the stunning Jean Seberg he smokes his way through a series of sexy Gallic exchanges to a sharp Jazz score in the coolest of cities.

The film debut of Jean-Luc Godard, ?BREATHLESS? spearheaded the French ?New Wave? of filmmaking, recognised as one of the most stylish and influential movements in cinema.

Produced by Georges de Beauregard, ?BREATHLESS? was developed by Godard from an original treatment by Francois Truffaut in a production that united the four initiators of the ?Nouvelle Vague?. Claude Chabrol acted as artistic advisor with the acclaimed director Jean-Pierre Melville appearing in front of the camera.
