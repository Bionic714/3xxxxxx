This is the ending tune on Lost (Se1 Ep17). A Superb audio track by Damian Rice.
At the end of episode 17 this is where the group starts to chill/relax a little. Sun goes for a swim : ) charlie and claire are together on the sand. . and Burely is listening to this AMAZING track! But then his batteries in his CD player runs out near the end of the track! Not to worry; you can get it hear!
The only episode of lost so far that didnt end on a cliffhanger (making you want to watch more, lol).
