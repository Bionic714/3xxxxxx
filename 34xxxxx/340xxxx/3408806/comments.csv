,sweety1003,2007-07-16T22:21Z,heey i downloaded this torrent but it won't play any sound. Please help because i really want to watch it 
,kellfive,2007-08-12T08:51Z,"Hi, I downloaded this, but am having trouble with the file extension .5 I cannot extract the files as winrar doesn't recognize the format. I tried changing the extension manually and that doesn't work. If I try to change the extension manually to .avi, I can play the first episode only in Windows Media, but no sound :( Pleeeease help. I live in the Yukon, Canada, waaay up North and we have a limit on how many MB we can download per month and this was huge so I don't want it to be a waste. Please help :)"
,kellfive,2007-08-12T10:40Z,"Correction to previous request for help. File extension is .sd not .5 I tried to play it in VLC media player and the sounds works, but either way it only plays the first episode...cannot get to the others. There were supposed to be a whole seasons worth of .avi's but I cannot get to them. Please help."
,ivystarr,2008-02-04T02:05Z,"I had that problem too, (no sound) but all you have to do is go to this site and download the decoder. After u download it, it should play with sound.
