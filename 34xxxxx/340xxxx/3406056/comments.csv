,Gillamon,2008-07-02T13:59Z,"Hi Guys,

I also had a problem with writing this ISO to DVD and my chipped PS2 also said ""Insert a valid PS2 disk"". 

I first used Nero with no luck, then I used Alcohol120 also with no luck so I downloaded ""DVD Decrypter"" from http://www.dvddecrypter.org.uk/.

I set DVD Decrypter to burn ISO and the first time it worked. Haven't played it yet though but watched the first little intro.

Well I hope my info helped!! :)

Also weirdly enough it didnt ask me for a password?! I see some of you are asking for one. I used WinRAR."
