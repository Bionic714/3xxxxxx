This program explores the ways in which the Third Reich linked occult practices with political aims, exploiting myths, pagan lore, and the occult. It takes us into the formation of the Aryan race religion, based on the idea of a descended race of god-men from Atlantis who had escaped the sinking continent, landing first in the Himalayas before resettling in Northern Europe, where they forgot their heritage and became weak by intermingling with "lesser" beings. The goal of the Third Reich wasn't nearly so mundane as the political and economic conquest of the Soviets, but nothing less than the recreation of that primordial god-race, whose blood ran most strongly in the Germanic peoples. And naturally, that goal ran hand in hand with the complete annihilation of all the lesser races.
