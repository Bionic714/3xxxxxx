It's incredible how neonazis try to deny historical facts to satisfy their petty hatreds against jews and probably everybody else (except guys like Goebbels who murdered his six children...), there are SS members who testified to the gas chambers and who were disgusted by the executions, described them in all detail (gassing) and refused to do it even at the risk of being shot, one got away with saying he was a catholic and didn't want to risk going to hell, the top SS brass laughed at him and let him off as a weakling... These neonazis revisionists deserve to be despised and spat on for condoning and denying such proven and  disgusting atrocities"
