,hotangel1986,2006-07-29T15:23Z,"u must know people that muslims and arabs dont hate jews for being jews we respest all religions but the problem is the crimes that happen everyday by hands of jews and their allies in america and bitish and others 
they kill arab babes and women and disarmed people even praying geriaterics the proplem is the stolen land of palestine"
,tomtomx,2006-09-13T23:45Z,Bullshit. First of all there never has been any land of palestine to steal. Secondly muslims have been cutting jewish and christian throats since the day of Mohammed. 
,gergith,2006-10-09T05:18Z,"tom tom, you cant use that logic though.. because if so, what were the crusades? no one is innocent, were all to blame, we need to accept responsibility of both sides!"
,tomtomx,2007-03-25T13:50Z,"""what were the crusades?""
Well, it sure wasn't a jewish campaign."
,as04qg,2007-07-18T07:35Z,"tomtomx..
i guess what ppl are trying to tell you here is that its better not to hate eachother..we can never hope for a better peaceful future if we think that way..
If you cant beleive that not all muslims hate jews then you need to look around n you'll see examples that contradict you..so dont be narrow minded..
The crusades example is a good one because that is when muslims were victimized and as a matter of fact even jews were killed by those who killed muslims..
So the enemy is not what they call ""The other""..they enemy lives in all of us..the seed of hatred and who knows if it wasnt for some hateful ppl on eachside, these religions would live in harmony as they did few hundred years ago.. "
,as04qg,2007-07-18T07:38Z,"ohh i just realized ..you might scorn me next for making up the fact that even jews were killed during crusades..I didnt make that up..the crusades were barbaric and those armies raided any town that was along the way and killed innocent ppl including jews..
History is sad..members of different religions have shed blood..it just happens that right now you can point fingers.."
