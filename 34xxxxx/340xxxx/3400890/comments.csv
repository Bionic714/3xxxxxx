,enjoypolo,2009-05-30T16:34Z,"God damn IT ! I have the movie, I downloaded it pretty long time ago, it might be this one, but I erased it a long time ago, and I only have it on DVD (you know, i burned it) and well, I kept it for a long time even though I had it, because it was PAL (which I can only read on my computer) and I AM TOTALLY fucked up to realize right now, what a wonderful movie it is ! So I'd be happy to make the movie available but it'll take me some time ...... however, dont miss it ! If I could buy this movie, even for $20, I would for sure !"
