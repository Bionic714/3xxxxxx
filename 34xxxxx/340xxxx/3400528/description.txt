As the title says, supposed to be viewed with 3D-glasses, but looks great without!


Amazon review:

There is no plot. There are no actors. This is your brain... on trance. Paul Oakenfold's 2001 album of Goa trance remixes has been transformed into a multidimensional experience. (The liner notes define "Goa trance" as "a fusion of acid trance and tribal beats.") Ten London-based musicians, including Man With No Name and the Infinity Project, provide the pulsating soundtrack, while artist Yo Suzuki provides the 3-D visuals (don't worry--glasses are included). Over the course of 12 selections, vibrant abstract shapes "dance" to the beat as sampled voices occasionally jump into the fray. That's about it. If you were fascinated by kaleidoscopes as a child, laser shows as a teen, and 2001: A Space Odyssey as an adult, this DVD is for you. While there is little (obvious) variation between tracks, trance isn't about jarring juxtapositions and A Voyage Into Trance is one smooth audiovisual ride.
