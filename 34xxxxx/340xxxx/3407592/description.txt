The story is simple enough. Cop comes back to his old 'hood but this time its in Kingston, Jamaica. That means dancehall, reggae and a great performance by Paul Campbell who was also in Dancehall Queen. Very entertaining and worth watching because of Campbell's acting. He moves the film along and is a presence on the screen. The "Dancehall Queen" Audrey Reid plays the love interest. The acting is good all the way around. The scenes were shot in the area of Dungle.
