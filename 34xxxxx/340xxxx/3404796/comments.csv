,rss_mafia,2006-05-01T12:47Z,"I've published an itunes rss feed with all 20 volumes from season 1.. ive also joined all the wma clips from each volume into m4a files.. so youve got 20, one hour long, clips instead of 200 3 minute long wma files.

Go here http://seej.hopto.org/?p=4 and follow the instrucs to add to iTunes. (Just drag link to xml file into itunes and it will start downloadin).

I guess its faster this way.. and easier.

****I'll also be posting the remaining clips from ""the early years"" and ""season 2""****"
