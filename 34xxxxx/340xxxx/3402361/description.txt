For most non-completists, this anthology should more than suffice as an apt compact disc retrospective of Canned Heat's releases on Liberty Records. To that end, it's a more or less chronological overview of the combo's LPs, commencing with a trio of tunes from a spring 1967 studio session that predates their self-titled debut (1967). Primary is an extended, seven-plus-minute "On the Road Again," losing the trippy pretensions of the more popular version. Rather, it churns and steadily burns throughout, displaying Canned Heat's primordial boogie-fused R&B delivery. The remainder of disc one focuses on the aforementioned Canned Heat (1967), the follow-up Boogie With Canned Heat (1968), and a half-dozen previously unreleased sides, this time from the fall of 1967 with a slightly different lineup that included Alan "Blind Owl" Wilson (guitar/vocals), Larry "The Mole" Taylor (bass), Henry "Sunflower" Vestine (guitar), and Bob "The Bear" Hite (vocals). Frank Cook (drums), who had contributed to the band's first effort, was replaced by Adolfo "Fido" de la Parra (drums). It is this aggregate that is considered the core of the "classic" incarnation. They are thoroughly solid, especially on John Lee Hooker's "Whiskey and Wimmen" (sic), a title that would resurface several years later when they faced off with Hooker on Hooker 'n' Heat (1971). Another not-to-be-missed rarity is the nearly ten-minute "Gotta Boogie" jam building off of Hooker's familiar rambling "Boogie Chillen" riff, as it explores some of Canned Heat's trademark instrumental interaction. This is most prominent between Wilson and Hite, and predates "Fried Hockey Boogie," although the vibe is undeniably the same. Disc one ends with two vintage radio adverts for Levi Strauss & Company and Boogie With Canned Heat, respectively. Disc two picks up with the singles "Evil Woman" and "Amphetamine Annie," among the other anticipatory tracks. Also included are "Going Up the Country," "Time Was," a take of the seasonal release "Christmas Blues" with Dr. John, as well as a 1968 vocal-less reworking of Robert Johnson's "Terraplane Blues" ? the latter pair being offered here for the first time. The same is true of the Hooker 'n' Heat outtake "It's All Right" and the poignant reading of "Human Condition," featuring Wilson on lead vocals. While those are the only hard-to-find recordings on this disc, there are two radio ads at the tail end. Otherwise, the albums Living the Blues (1968), Hallelujah (1969), Future Blues (1970), Historical Figures & Ancient Heads (1971), as well as The New Age (1973), are given their due, though most casual listeners and/or purists may see these to be filler rather than killer. The accompanying 28-page liner booklet is filled with discographical information and a great historical essay from noted music journalist Greg Russo.
