From Moberly, Missouri. This band formed in 1962 as the Checkmates but changed name to Plato and The Philosophers in 1965 and lasted until 1970. The Thirteen O'Clock Flight To Psychedelphia (CD) retrospective features the band's story, from which the personnel is confirmed, and features fourteen tracks: the It 45, and many unreleased goodies - two versions of Thirteen O'Clock..., Wishes, the proposed third 45 Doomsday Nowhere City / I Knew, and seven others from 1968 onwards, which include some excellent heavy acid-punkers. Other artists feature on the CD - Something Wild, Smoke (Houston's ex-Nomads) and the Fortunes. 

Their first 45 was a routine garage effort. You'll also find the 'A' side, I Don't Mind, on Monsters Of The Midwest, Vol. 3 (LP). Monsters Of The Midwest, Vol. 2 (LP) includes the 'A' side of the Fairyland 45, Thirteen O'Clock Flight To Psychedelphia. It doesn't live up to its name but does feature some arresting double lead guitar breaks and rather haunting harmonies.
