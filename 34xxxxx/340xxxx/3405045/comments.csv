,Matryem,2006-03-14T23:24Z,Great Thanks!  But what about the arseholes that are downloading who are taking and not giving FUCKING PARASITES!!!!!!
,Matryem,2006-03-15T18:11Z,Well finaly I got it downloaded and its only a trial offer 30 days. The key generator does not work.  This all it gives after several attempts: INVALID REQUEST CODE!   FUCKING DONT TORRENT DEMOS ARSEHOLE
,MECM,2006-04-23T01:44Z,You have to make the request code one full code like this. FROM 1234 5678 9102 TO 123456789102. That is how I got mine to work!
,jamie.sharpe,2006-05-29T10:40Z,"ive tried the download a few times now and it just stops at 83.7% and i dont know why ps (to me im classified as a n00b since its the 3rd thing ive downloaded, but i do know about comps)"
,SnakeX1,2006-07-02T10:32Z,Damn it! I dunno if anyone else has got the problem but for me it says: Error 1920. Service 'RaySat_3dsmax8 Server' (mi-raysat_3dsmax8) failed to start. Verify that you have sufficient priviligies to start system services.                Ill wirte a comment if I find out how to get this working.

,naboth,2006-07-13T04:05Z,"Ok, here's the fix.  This issue is specifically addressed on the Autodesk website, and there is a very simple registry fix.  I tried it and it worked like a charm, so here's the url in case anybody needs it:

,car54,2007-01-08T18:51Z,"This is a fantastic torrent and works just fine.

NOT  a 30 day wonder, full licence.

Follow the install instructions carefully.Vovik has given a step by step for any dick head out there to follow.

If you can't work out how to install it then don't bother and go back and use a crayon for your graphics.......

Once it's installed it occupies an average 1.2 gig of hdd space.
You will need a good set of specs to realize its full potential check the web site.

Thanks Vovik for your torrent."
