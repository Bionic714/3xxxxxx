3 hrs. 6 min.

Audio: English
Subs : English, Spanish, French.

 The Old Testament story of Abraham and the trials he endures. Commanded by God to lead his family to the 

promised land of Canaan with the promise that if he does so, his descendants will become a great and

they prove their faith to God.

Gospel Of John DVD 1 and 2:

This widely acclaimed motion picture is a meticulous recreation of the turbulent era of Jesus and the 

events that changed the course of history! Narrated by Golden Globe nominee Christopher Plummer (Best 

Supporting Actor, AMERICAN TRAGEDY, 2000), it?s the bold and powerful story of Jesus as told by his 

disciple John. The best-loved but least understood of the gospels, John presents a uniquely human 

portrait of courage and passion encompassing Jesus' entire three-year ministry, the final years of his 

life. Intimate and reflective, THE GOSPEL OF JOHN offers an unparalleled opportunity to experience the 

incomparable life and times of Jesus Christ. 

=======================================================================
Jeremiah DVD:

The young Jeremiah grows up in a priest's family in the village of Anathoth, near Jerusalem. God appears 

to Jeremiah in different human guises on several occasions, and makes it clear to him that he has been 

selected to announce God's message to the people of Jerusalem: a mighty ruler from the north will attack 

the Kingdom of Judah if the people there continue to worship false idols, and fail to remember the One 

God. No-one in Anathoth believes Jeremiah's prophecy, however. Instead, he is accused of blasphemy and is 

physically attacked - and not even his family comes to his aid. Nevertheless, with the help of Baruch, a 

temple scribe who hears Jeremiah's first sermon and becomes his disciple, Jeremiah succeeds in announcing 

the word of God. The prophet's message of impending doom incurs only the wrath and rejection of the 

rulingclasses, the priesthood and the King. Jeremiah can find no audience, and lands up in captivity 

again - but even though he even has to leave his true love for Judith to fate, he still sticks firmly to 

his mission. It is only when war with the enemy forces from Babylon seems inevitable that the people of 

Jerusalem start to grow restless, and Jeremiah gradually starts to win support. However the King, who is 

taking the advice of the false prophet Hananiah, is certain that the country's powerful neighbours, the 

Egyptians, will come to his assistance. Shortly afterwards, however, the Babylonians lay siege to the 

Holy City. Although the King now believes Jeremiah, he still finds it impossible to make the decision to 

surrender the city. Jerusalem goes up in flames, and the people are led off into exile in Babylon.

Jesus Of Nazareth DVD 1 and 2:

imdb user rating 8.5/10 (1,408 votes)

 Editorial Reviews
Amazon.com essential video

Originally made for TV in 1977, this in-depth (six hours plus) version of Jesus' life is so thorough that 

the first hour is devoted solely to the story of his birth. The film doesn't skimp on some of the other 

landmark events of this famous story either. Director Franco Zeffirelli gives more than 12 minutes screen 

time each to the Last Supper and the Crucifixion. Passages of the Bible are quoted verbatim, the 

locations have a Palestine-like authenticity, and,aside from some of the principals (Robert Powell as 

Jesus, Olivia Hussey as Mary, and Stacy Keach as Barabbas), many of the non-Roman characters are actually 

played by Semitic-looking actors. Zeffirelli diligently provides the sociopolitical background that gave 

rise to Jesus' following and the crisis in belief it caused for the people of Israel (and one or two 

Romans). While not graphic by today's standards, some of the scenes--baby boys being ripped from their 

mothers' arms and slaughtered, nails being driven into Jesus' hands--may disturb young and/or sensitive 

children. --Kimberly Heinrichs

Christian woman to whom he gives the written records of his visions that would become the Book of 

Revelation. With Vittoria Belvedere, Benjamin Sadler, Christian Kohlund."

captive by the emperor of Rome. From the depths of captivity, John attempts to spread the word of the 

Lord to anyone and everyone who expresses interest. When a young Christian woman manages to reach John, 

she's given his many journals filled with past experiences, which later become the Book of Revelations."

David DVD

Runtime: 3 hrs. 10 min.

Audio: English
Subs : English, Spanish, French.

Amazon Review (edited): by Alejandra Vernon

 This is a marvelous production, filmed in Morocco, with wonderful costumes, textiles, and rustic sets, 

making this telling of King David's life visually believable. It has some standout performances, and 

Nathaniel Parker, always a favorite of mine, fares well as Israel's second king. As Saul, the casting of 

Jonathan Pryce is an odd choice (Saul was "a head taller than his people" and there was "not a man more 

handsome than he") but it works, and he is exceptional as the tormented and demented king.

Gideon Turner is very good as the young David, Dominic Rowan is a great bit of casting as Absalom, and as 

Joab, Maurice Roeves is terrific. Other notables play the two prophets, Leonard Nimoy, in an appealing 

and powerful portrayal of Samuel, and Franco Nero as a handsome Nathan.

 The photography is lovely (by Raffaele Mertes) and the melodic score by Carlo Siliotto enhances the mood 

(the final title music is by Ennio Morricone).

The story line picks up at 1 Samuel, Chapter 9, with Saul looking for his father's mules, and proceeds 

through much of both books of Samuel, often being quite faithful to them. It is interspersed with the 

occasional Psalm, and writer Larry Gross has blended scripture and dialogue quite effectively. It is 

interesting to watch this with Bible in hand, to see just how cleverly this has been done.

There are some moving scenes, like David's annointing, and his proposal to Abigail (played by the 

beautiful Lina Sastri).  This is a way above-average film for television. There are a few gory battle 

scenes that would be too violent for the very young, but otherwise this is an excellent family film for 

older children, with the complexity of King David making it a fascinating story for discussion and 

repeated viewings.

Joshua DVD

Runtime: 90 min.

Audio: English
Subs : none


 The town of Auburn was always normal, to say the least. True, the people there weren't really a 

"community", but they never noticed...until a stranger named Joshua rolled into town one morning. In 

small ways, Joshua began to help out around the town-helping a teen play guitar, helping save a marriage 

in danger, or teaching a bumbling priest how to speak about faith. An old Baptist church that came down 

in a storm is his next big project. With the help of stuttering Theo, who dreams of being a preacher, he 

brings the town together to restore the old building. In this way, the whole town unites and becomes a 

community. This attracts the attention of Father Tordone, who is a bitter man due to the fact that he 

lost a position in the Vatican. When the mysterious Joshua begins to show up in two places at once and 

miraculously cures a blind woman, Father Tordone believes Joshua is a false prophet, trying to cheat 

people. When his next huge miracle-reviving Theo from death after he falls from the roof of the newly 

completed church-overwhelms the town, Father Tordone seeks out an official condemnation from the Vatican. 

But Joshua melts his icy heart, and the reformed Father becomes a Vatican member. Joshua sees the Pope 

himself and reveals himself as Jesus! After his meeting, Joshua leaves-but the people of Auburn, with 

their dreams fufilled and their happiness increased.
