This installment focuses solely on Chan Ho Nam (Ekin Cheng). By now, his rank has gone up and his image has changed into more of a political gangster rather than a rascal. Challenged by Szeto Ho Nam (Mark Cheng) of Tung Sing Group and backed by a business mogul, Ho Nam must face one of his toughest challenges ? the world of business and finance. As much as Ho Nam wants to keep things clean in his business transactions, he cannot overcome his ruthlessness as a mob leader and has to ultimately come to terms with it. As the series begins to close up, Y&D Part V is one of the better sequels in this saga. (from Aznfilms.com)
