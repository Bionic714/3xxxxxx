CAT.v2.11.Update.Plugin.for.3Ds.Max.6.7.8.Incl.Patch-4DNinja

CAT2.1 includes:

An even more powerful procedural spine;
Export to Gamebryo fixed;
Support for small icons and dark colour schemes;
Many important bug fixes.
Upgrading to CAT2.1 is critical for all CAT users and anyone serious about character animation.


CAT2 introduces the most powerful character animation toolset commercially available to date for 3ds Max users. A huge jump forward from its predecessor and other existing systems, CAT2 combines all the powerful capabilities of the previous versions plus key enhancements, including:

New Rig Manipulation system ? With F/IK?, just push the character into the pose you want. No extra windows. No fuss.
Foot Pivot System ? Position and animate the foot pivot without complication or limitation.
Stretchy Bones Mode ? Drag the length of individual bones in the viewport with the mouse. Animate the scale of all rig bones, including spines, with no skewing ? perfect for cartoon-style characters and facial rigs.
Time Warp Curves ? Control the velocity of a whole animation layer with a single spline curve. The Matrix-like bullet-time effects were never easier!
Extra Bones ? Create more bones to be used as facial bones, stomach bones, weapon bones, etc. Create and attach whole facial rigs to a character rig.
Edit Rig Mesh ? Create the perfect proxy mesh, and then save it as a rig preset for reuse.
Motion Data Importing ? Import motion data files in HTR, BVH, FBX and BIP formats.
