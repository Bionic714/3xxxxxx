Powerful, compelling and deeply shocking, ?KIDS? spends twenty-four frenetic hours with a group of New York teenagers. Skateboarders Telly and Casper hang out, shoplift, do drugs and seduce girls. Jennie follows the pair across the city, desperate to confront them with a terrible truth. Written by Harmony Korine (?GUMMO?), ?KIDS? is an unflinching depiction of the beauty and tragedy of youth, a story of a single day in which everything and nothing will change.
