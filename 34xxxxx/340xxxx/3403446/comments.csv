,Machinx2,2008-03-29T00:47Z,does someone know what to do when the Error:bad module'friends/friendsUI.dll' pops up in steam down????
,Arctic_0ne,2008-06-12T02:07Z,"I found this about the screwed up friends/friendsui.dll thing

""all you need to do to fix the steamfriends.dll issue is go into your steam directory, the friends folder, and DELETE the friends.dll file. After this, run steam. You may be prompted with a similar message telling you the serversomething.dll also cannont be opened. Same process here; head back to the directory, go to the Servers folder, and delete that dll. Again, restart Steam, and you should be on your way. The files will be recreated anew. I believe the error is a result of the previous files remaining untouched by the uninstallation process. Hope that helps. """
,sam12168,2008-07-10T20:48Z,"to all those that are having problems with friendsui.dll and serverbroswer.dll:
i'm not 100% sure this will work, but it worked for me when i got this error on pacsteam.
go into your down steam or whatever its called and go into the ""friends"" folder and delete the ""friendsui.dll"" in there.
also go to your ""servers"" folder and delete ""serverbroswer.dll"" then delete ""winui.gcf"" in your steam down apps folder. then go to this site: http://katzforums.com/showthread.php?t=54505
download the two files on there and put them into your ""bin"" folder. (yes i know there the same ones you deleted before, but their better)
now run downsteam and all should be well."
