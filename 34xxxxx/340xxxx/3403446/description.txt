Installation: 

- Run the installer and install it to any folder of your choice. 
- Always start Steam-Down with the Steam-Down EXE and not with the Steam EXE 
- Put your New or Current steam account and password in the login and login. 
- If you allready have downloaded GCF's, put them in the C:Program FilesSteam-DownSteamApps folder before you start Steam-Down so it detects them. 
- The first time you start Steam-Down, it will download platform files promptly from Steam. 
- Your antivirus or firewall programs may not recognize the running programs, so always give access to them. 

On some antivirus scan, SD releases packages can reveal "Type_Win32", "Trojan_Type" virus etc. Don't be stupid, it's not a virus or anything else like that. Just some packers/cryptors which have same binary signature. 

Things To Know Before Using: 

-Do Not use your real Steam account with Steam-Down unless you want to take the risk of it being banned. Make a new account and use that one. 
-When you use Steam-Down, you can only play online when:

FAQ 
-------------------- 

Steam-Down: 

Can I use my real Steam account when using Steam-Down? 
-Do Not use your real Steam account with Steam-Down unless you want to take the risk of it being banned. Make a new account and use that one. 

Can I play online with Steam-Down? 
When you use Steam-Down, you can only play online when: 

1)You use your real account but take a risk of it being banned. 
2)You use your new account and play in a fixed server (download Non Steam-Down for this). 
3)You find a way to fix the Invalid Ticket problem. 

Steam-Down gives you complete 100% access to the games. You can play the Single Player portion, through LAN or through fixed servers without a problem. Basically, you can play anywhere except in the Valid online servers. The Invalid Ticket Fix is being worked on, so be patient. 

What do I do when I get the error message "Invalid User ID Ticket?" 
-You can't do anything for this because there is no fix for it. If you want to play in a fixed server, download Non Steam-Down. 

I used the Steam-Down to have the CS:Source GCF files, but it downloaded only 1GB of it. How can I have the whole GCF file? 
-You must be patient. Go to the monitor screen and wait till the download is 100% complete. 

When I start CSS, I get 3 errors in the console: 

--- Missing Vgui material vgui/steam/games/icon_cs 
--- Missing Vgui material vgui/steam/games/icon_hl2mp 
--- Missing Vgui material vgui/steam/games/icon_dod 

And when I try to run the game without Steam-Down, it says gameinfo.txt doesn't exist in HL2. 
-The best and easy solution is to delete all the GCF's of the games who are giving you problems and download them again with Steam-Down. The other solution, but complicated: Install GCFscape & Microsoft Framework 1.1 on your computer. Search for the GCF's who have the files that are missing and delete only that GCF and Download it again with Steam-Down. 

There are certain times when I start Steam-Down and the console runs up but it crashes suddenly with error 108. How do you fix this? 
-This error is just saying that the SteamEngine.exe is already running. Go to your task manager, under the processes tab, and close the SteamEngine.exe. Then restart Steam-Down and it should work fine. 

Non Steam-Down: 

Can you use this installer without having your GCF files put in Non Steam-Down folder? 
-You can use it as long as you have the GCF files. It doesnt matter where,as long as you install the program to where you have them. 

When I press the PLAY button in the Non-Steam Down menu, I can't see any games there. What am I doing wrong? 
-Your GCF files are probably misplaced. You need them in your Non Steam-Down/steamapps folder. They can't be the shortcuts either. 

Could you please explain the NSD folder? I don't have one of those in my SteamApps directory? 
-It means Non Steam-Down. Inside there should be a SteamApps folder with your GCF's. 

Could you explain what kind of people can join a fixed server? Legit, Fixed, or Emulators? 
-Everyone can join. 

Will my cracked server be visible to legit user's Steam server browser? 
-Yes. 

I don't understand this step for creating a fixed server. 

"6. Chose LAN and put SV_LAN 1 , and start the server" 

I can choose LAN, but where can i find SV_LAN 1? Where can I change this? 
-Just type it into the console by pressing "~". 

I keep getting this error when I try to join a server: 

"Server is using different class tables" 

How do you fix this? 
-You should delete your user directory and it will work again. 

How do you get Non-Steam Down to work with downloaded maps? 
-Extract any downloaded map(s) to the "Steam-DownSteamAppsuserhl2roothl2mpmaps" directory.
