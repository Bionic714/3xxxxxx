,vanux,2006-05-22T00:11Z,"Look boys, once you install and crack the program its normal for it to give an error when connecting to the server, what you guys have to do is just go to the uninstall wizard and click repair. That will fix the problem..........."

,mcem222,2007-01-21T22:34Z,"No, I read that if you go to control panel and repair it, it just turns into the free version. you have to have an account for google earth pro, meaning its probably very difficult or impossible to crack it"
