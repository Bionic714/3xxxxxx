   Because UltraEdit is so powerful, many of our users already use it      
   as an IDE and have provided us feature requests to extend that          
   functionality. Together, we have taken those requests, our own          
   ideas, and the concept of a supercharged IDE and produced what we       
   consider to be a powerful application with new and exciting features    
   such as Native Support for over 30 popular compliers, Integrated CVS    
   Version Control, built-in Class Browsing, Language Intelligence         
   (like Intellisense), Project Converter, and a Batch Builder to name     
   just a few.
