,sevenarmy,2009-04-08T14:52Z,"Check out The Star of Bethlehem! Documentary. Starry Night softawre backs up the facts about the birth of Jesus. If you go to 2B.C. Dec 25 from the region of Bethlehem that is 5 miles south of Iraq you will see Jupiter swirl into a halo around the constellation Leo in Greek meaning King. It is also next to the Planet Venus which is Virgin in Greek! It is all very fascinating in an Asstrological sense and more so in a Biblcal sense. Also, John speaks of signs in the sky in the book of Revalation!! See for yourself ...God be with you!"
