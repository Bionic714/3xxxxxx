Ok...this is the CD2 I've promised.

*For those who wonder why I split the whole .iso into parts,my reason will be to ease sharing.I've noticed that it is easier to share several small parts than one large chhunk.

**For those who wonder how to use the files:-
1. Download all the files  (duh)
2. Make sure all of them are in the same folder  (again...duh)
3. Open Starry Night Pro5 cd2.part01 and extract it to the destination you want.
4. Mount it on a virtual drive or burn it into a cd.

That's all folks.Wait for CD3 then.
