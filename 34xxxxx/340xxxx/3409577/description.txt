Peak-oil is a theory that goes like this:  The global production of oil will hit
 its peak and start to decline.  It doesn't mean the world will run out of oil,
 it means the world will run out of cheap oil.  This idea has been around since
    the mid '50's.  Back then a Shell Oil geologist name Marion King Hubbert
  predicted that U.S. oil production would hit its peak in the early 1970's.  

  Remember the shock back in the early 1970's?  It's nothing compared to what
 supporters of the peak-oil concept think we're in for once the decline starts.
