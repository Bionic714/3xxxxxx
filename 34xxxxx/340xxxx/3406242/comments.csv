,XtremeD,2009-08-06T05:59Z,"I have a VHS copy of this one somewhere up in the attic :) 
Found the movie in a small video rental store outside Huntsville, Alabama, around -98 or -99. Had no idea what it was but with a title like that it just has to be great, eh?
Saw it later the same evening, and spent half the next day trying to get someone to copy it for me so I could bring it back home to Sweden.

It's a classic, never have I laughed so much while watching NotLD :) "
,stftpb,2010-03-11T10:15Z,"I cannot yet comment on the file, as it is not yet complete.  But I could not wait to comment on the content!  I have (or had) a moldy old copy of this.  I had a commercial, ie vid-store, vhs copy, and the quality was - now work with me here - good enough.  
I looked for years for that tape.  Then I learned about .torrents!  So when I failed to find a torrent, I set again to find my videocassette, because this film really should be shared with the world.  
NotDotSotBotRotRotTotAot... meshes with the spirit of TPB and sharing communities - the director found he could mangle Romero's work for profit, because there was no copyright on NotLD!
So now I'll race anyone: I'll try find and capture Deadtime Stories and post it here before you do!"
,stftpb,2010-03-12T04:10Z,"Yup.  It plays and it's just as (blecch) good as it ever was!  Thank you, LRon and seeders! Now if someone would just seed Deadtime Stories..."
,nwbearcat82,2012-06-12T16:01Z,"seed please. I'm stuck at 47%. I've been wanting a digital copy of this for a while now. Have an old VHS copy that I found on EBay after searching for years to find it. First saw this back in the mid-90's in Maryville, MO and have loved it ever since. It is an endless source of movie quote one liners in my group of friends."
