-WHAT THE BACK OF THE CASE SAYS-
	"In 1967, George Romero, using non-professional actors and actresses and a crew made up of friends and relatives made what has become the most famous horror film of all time: "Night of the Living Dead".
	
	Recently, filmaker Lowell Mason, while reveiwing "Night of the Living Dead" noticed some flaws in the structure of the script. He obtained a copy of the film, wiped out the soundtrack and replaced it with his own dialogue and music.

         The result follows."

-WHAT REALLY HAPPENS-
	Cross out 'noticed flaws in structure' and replace with 'found there weren't enough swears, racial and sexual slurs, animal soundfx, toilet humor and many other instances of complex humor'.

-Notes-
Being pissed off that this cult classic is such a pain to find, and I haven't seen any working torrents in so long, I decided to make the sacrifice, spend the $15 and buy the 'best quality' shitty bootleg DVD I found on ebay. Obviously its still transfered from a VHS, I don't know if a film print of it even exists, and the quality leaves much to be desired as usual, but this XviD actually looks better than the DVD which has more ghosting and interlacing problems than you can shake a stick at (whatever the hell that means). So enjoy the sacrifice I made for the BT community in order to share this gem amongst the good people that deserve to see it.

That being said, the movie doesn't need much explanation. If you are a fan of MST3K, you will probably love it. It's exactly what the outline says, NotLD sans soundtrack with one guy doing all the voices and adding new SFX and the such. It's a movie that people should be able to see without buying from bootleggers, so share it and spread it everywhere!
