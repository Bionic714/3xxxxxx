Lacrimosa's second album is more or less in the vein of the first. It's
a very dark and sometimes opressive. Musically, Tilo has improved since
his beginnings.

Einsamkeit...German for isolation or loneliness ...the word really sums
it up perfectly. Indeed, beautiful in its loneliness, vast in its
hopelessness, the album - a significant step in Lacrimosa's history.

Where Angst, Tilo Wolff's 1991 debut, was a barren and minimalist foray
into mostly one dimensional, darkwave synth "rock," (and I use the term
very loosely) Einsamkeit brings to the table a much-needed flair for
drama and theatricality - two aspects Lacrimosa would forthwith nurture
and cultivate.

The songs are generally lengthy and weighty affairs; isolated vistas of
morose, forlorn vocals, drawn out keyboards, sparse guitars, cellos,
violins, accordions. Very intimate and focused in on their common theme
of "einsamkeit," but also quite towering and epic in their tragic
grandeur.

This is still a band (or more correctly, an individual) just starting to
become aware of the scope and magnitude of their vision, of what the
music may grow into sometime down the line; there are still the
occasional flaws and rookie stumbles. Einsamkeit is still an immensely
satisfying piece of work, transcending the mundane gloom & doom gothic
clichs with its rich, vivid, poetic display of unbound emotion and soul.
More so, it's a harbinger of things to come, and when seen in the scope
of Lacrimosa's entire body of work, a truly mesmerizing harbinger it is
indeed.
