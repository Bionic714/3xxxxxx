As a huge Family Guy fan, I've been wanting to make a good drinking game to go along with the show. This was my solution: A Power Hour full of Family Guy clips! 60 minutes of great Family Guy shorts, and every minute, the video alerts you to drink! I only wish I had made this before graduating from college!
