This is XEBIAN a debian system for 
the XBOX (tm) and PC. 

You get one main isofile : 

VERSION.iso: 

The Version could be for example : 

1.1.0-xbox.iso. 

This image is for installing. 

On the iso image you have 2 additional 
iso images : 

boot_hdd.iso: 

This image is for starting an native 
partition installation. 

boot_fatx_e.iso: 

This image is for booting an installation 
from the e: partition. 

For burning the cd you can use cdrecord as follow: 

cdrecord -dev=0,0,0 -dao -driveropts=burnfree -speed=4 <image> 

For Example : 

cdrecord -dev=0,0,0 -dao -driveropts=burnfree -speed=4 1.1.0-xbox.iso. 

If you dont know the devicenumber of your burner use 

cdrecord -scanbus 

Default netconfig of the Debian cd after the first startup. 
IP : 192.168.0.10 
NETMASK : 255.255.255.0 

Users and passwords : 

live/live 
root/xebian 


Starting the installation : 

If you have burned the install image boot it on your 
XBox and wait until the graphical environment is started. 
At this point you have the coice between an local 
installation via usb keyboard, xpad or using the network. 
For using the network you need an ssh client to connect 
to the XBox. 
For remote installation : 
For the login use the username root and the password 
xebian for login. 
For a local installation: 
Become the superuser. You can make this with: 
su - 
or 
ssh root@localhost 
For the login use the username root and the password 
xebian for login. 
The next step is to start the installation 
programm. It is called XBOXLinuxInstall . Here you can select 
the installation method. 

"Installing XBOXLinux inside the Game Partition": 

This installs linux in an file on the e: partition. 
If you select this you will be asked for the filesize of 
the swap and the rootfs file. 
The maximum filesize for the rootfs is 2000 MB. 

"Installing XBOXLinux in the unused space of the HDD": 

This will install linux in a native partition after the e: 
partition. This partition is also called f:. The original f: 
partition will be overwritten. So backup data if you have 
some on it. 

Now the installation begins. This take some time. 
Wait until the next dialog apears. 
After the copy of the files is finished the installer ask 
you some basic questions of the networksetup. 

Now you can reboot the XBox and burn the right bootcd or 
use the files on e:debian. 

Remember: 

boot_fatx_e.iso -> Game Partition installation 
boot_hdd.iso -> unused space of the HDD 

Or use the files on e:debian  

Autologon. 

To dissable the autologon edit the file /etc/inittab and serach for 
the lines from: 

1:12345:respawn:/sbin/mingetty --noclear --autologin live tty1 
#1:2345:respawn:/sbin/getty 38400 tty1 

to : 

#1:12345:respawn:/sbin/mingetty --noclear --autologin live tty1 
1:2345:respawn:/sbin/getty 38400 tty1 

If you wanna have the MCE mode then change the line : 

1:12345:respawn:/sbin/mingetty --noclear --autologin live tty1 

to 

1:12345:respawn:/sbin/mingetty --noclear --autologin mce tty1 

The CD also contains the contruction kit for a new livecd. 
It's in the file xbmake.tar.gz. 

BIG FAT WARNING : 

After the first boot login as root and change 
the passwords of the following users : 

root live mce 

You can do this by running the command : 

passwd <username> 

If you don't do this, you let a big security hole 
open. Everyone knows the passwdord of this three 
users. 

Hint : 

If you run the live CD, don't mount anything on 
/mnt . This wi'll stop working of the livecd. 
Make a directory in /mnt and mount your things 
there.
