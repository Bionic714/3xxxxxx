,Arwin30,2007-07-29T09:28Z,"Hey Mate I am getting the same conditions as ""steven2k7"" stated, could there be something wrong with the way we extracted it?

If someone could post a full out tutorial or something on how to extract and burn the files correctly that would be terrific, because I use ISOBuster and it is diffucult as you have several options for extraction (which type of extraction and what to extract!?).

In the second CD all I have is the Autorun file, the Cab and the CDCheck, is there suposed to be anything else? And in the third CD I have the same except I also have hte Age of The Empire III History Channel Trailers mumbo.

Any help is much appreciated!"
