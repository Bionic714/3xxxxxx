,Musebajs,2008-09-27T18:02Z,"OTE rpg is one of the most succesful games I've run. I don't remember right now, but I believe it WAS Robin Laws who designed it along with his sister or something. 

The Place: A surreal island called Al Amarja in the mediterrenean where anything can happen. 

The Setting: Anything you want it to be (fantasy, Sci-Fi, Horror, Comedy and so on, or a wild mix of any or all of the above.

The rules are loose to emphasise the story, but in my games I've found a good balance mixing in some rules (but mostly tables) from Gurps (quite easy to convert). Tho GM (storytellers imagination and creativity is the only thing that can limit the experience of Al Amarja, and my players have been imaginative enough to come up with som rather good characters (ie: a pink flying elephant, a commando smurf, a dog with electrokinetic powers, a reporter ghost who didn't know he was dead yet and a secret agent for the Apes (an ape with a film noir PI-coat and hat and a banana gun))... 

The perfect game to set your AD&D or CoC games in a perspective."
