just one little problem.

it seems that i cant play half the mp3's from the new race album. and none of the masterplan stuff!

mindows media player 11, and creative media source 5 just loads the file.... blank screen.... no music? i've reched the torrent a few times. caught that some files havent downloaded properly. should i just give it another download?"
,redstarjedi,2008-03-08T04:27Z,"umm. ok for some reason nero showtime will play the tracks that dont work in the new race album..... but then again it seems to play the wrong track. i try track 8 that isnt workign and it'll play track one instead?
