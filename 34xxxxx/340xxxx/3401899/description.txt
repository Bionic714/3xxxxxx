The old girl from the world of showbiz, Mama Rose, proves both indestructable and a fine vehicle for singing female stars. Originally created by Ethel Merman, for whom it was written, the part has been variously handled by Rosalind Russell in the film version (not available on CD), Angela Lansbury, Tyne Daly, and more recently Bette Midler, among many others. The quintessential backstage musical, and for many the best ever written, Gypsy related the real-life story of stripper Gypsy Rose Lee and her sister June Haver, and how each was shaped into a star of the first magnitude by their monster of a stage mother. With a fine, solid book by Arthur Laurents, and a splendid score by Jule Styne (music) and Stephen Sondheim (lyrics), the show has endured through repeated revivals, losing none of its freshness and its strength, even though by now its plot and tunes have become remarkably familiar. The three recordings listed here are all superb in their own right, the personality of the actress playing Mama Rose being the main focus. Merman, the belter and originator of the part, is still the best, though the recording itself, an early transfer to CD from the original analog tapes, leaves a bit to be desired sonically. Tyne Daly, in the 1990 Broadway revival, added her own touch to the role, but without significantly altering it, in a performance that has its moments of excellence. As for Bette Midler, in the 1993 television treatment, she camps the part a bit, but she is also remarkably true to the spirit of the original in a performance that has been justifiably lauded.
