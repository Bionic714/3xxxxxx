Only 5 episodes this week, Saturdays broadcast was a repeat (the one with Dawn Wells and Russell Johnson from Giligans Island). 

Also I didnt realize that several episodes were recorded in mono audio, this has been fixed.  I blame the ATI AiW 8500 attachment, which doesnt lock onto the back of the card.  I will re-capture these episodes latter.
