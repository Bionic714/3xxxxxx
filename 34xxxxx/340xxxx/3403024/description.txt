Michael and Me features best-selling author (The 10 Things You Can't Say in America), talk radio and TV host Larry Elder as he challenges Michael Moore's 2002 hit documentary "Bowling for Columbine," concluding that NRA member Michael Moore's message was that America has "too many guns." Elder opposes that premise in his own attempt to unravel the growing problem of gun violence in America's schools.
