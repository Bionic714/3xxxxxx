Somewhere in Texas, one of the most famous episodes of the Iraq war;  the heroic rescue of U.S. Private Jessica Lynch ? was turned into a scene for a made-for-TV movie.  The movie was broadcast on TV earlier this Fall, but not without sparking some controversy.  The official military version of the rescue had been contradicted by several investigative journalists. But when the film was produced, a U.S. Army official was on the set overseeing the operation.  The U.S. Army also had direct control over the script, but at what expense to reality? With the help of interviews with key military officials and filmmakers, Hollywood and the Pentagon:  A Dangerous Liaison attempts to explain the behind-the-scenes relations between Hollywood and the Pentagon.
