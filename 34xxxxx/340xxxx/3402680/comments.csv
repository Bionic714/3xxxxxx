,mathsyaka,2006-04-17T17:09Z,somebody please seed the torrent. I am suck up at 81.2% :(
,fisrulloman,2006-08-31T15:44Z,"What scanner did you use? what was the latest signature update used while scanning? what virus was found? did you try to ""clean"" the specific files; what happened?

Is this a NOGOOD torrent?"
,mydog,2006-09-11T01:26Z,can anyone confirm that this is a good torrent? what about the viruses? I found another torrent on the net for sql server dev. but the size is only 1.7GB so thats weird ... all I want to know is if this is worth downloading? thanks!
,xerox6502,2006-12-16T20:33Z,"For what it is worth, I downloaded, mounted, and scanned the mounted install using NOD32 with latest virus defs, and it found nothing."
,xerox6502,2006-12-16T20:35Z,"Also, it has installs for x86, 64bit, and Itanium machines, which may account for the larger size."
,Cut_Creator,2007-04-24T20:42Z,"NO there is NO virus here!
Some shits AV-tools reports FP (False Positive).

By the way, this is of topic but worth to point out over again:
The biggest known virus out there is:
The actual Virus Application! Yeah!
You read right.
And the worse of them all is Norton's shit...

Okay, I am off my soap box now...

PS: Supafly2000, thanx for a good torrent!"
,renatois,2008-04-01T16:00Z,"I need help, pls. Which file do I have to install?"
,blackr2d,2008-08-22T20:18Z,"Just to ease the doubts - this torrent is 100%. No viruses, installs 100%. I chose all options, together with sample code and documentation.

Errors that were mentioned here (xxx.msi corrupt) are not at all connected to this torrent.
The error message is actually misleading - they come from the fact that you have a different version of the mentioned component installed on your machine already.
Uninstall it and all is good in the Danish Kingdom. ;)

(Hint - do you have MSDE installed? Remove it.) ;)

Thank you Supafly2000, great torrent. :)"
,devarishi,2009-03-30T01:39Z,"Can anybody help me in getting rid of the trial period of this package:

Microsoft SQL Server 2008 180-day Trial Software

Downloaded from the vendor's website.

Any serial key or method to make it a permanentversion? I am now afraid of using Patch/Keygen as it carries viruses and trojans."
,h.patel,2009-08-13T16:14Z,"How Do I install this software man ?????
There is all ZIP files....... :-(
Pls tell me anyone How to install this software ????"
,zaighamgill,2009-12-08T14:37Z,"Hi h.patel
just extract any zip file. There is an ISO image file inside that. Use Daemon Tools to use this image file."
,valenok7,2011-02-07T20:51Z,"Unpacked iso image equals to en_sql_2005_dev_all_dvd.iso provided by MS with MSDN subscription.
So definitely no malware here."
