The Board Designer's Guide to Testable Logic Circuits
Colin Maunder

Are you looking to reduce the cost of testing your board design?
Reading this book you will realize that design-for-test has many benefits and need not
be difficult. By following a few essential steps you will significantly reduce the cost of
testing your finish eel board design.
Matching the way a board is designed, this comprehensive book considers
design-for-test requirements in a step-by-step fashion with explanations of why a
feature is needed and what the consequences of ignoring it might be.
The hook:
3 presents design-for-test principles In a manner that matches the way a
board is designed
3 provides checklists to assess the testability of each completed design
3 includes a chapter on the important IEEE standard on boundary-scan
(IEEE Std 1149.1)
3 discusses how a development project should be managed so that a testable
design is achieved
This book will be very valuable for engineers and managers involved wish electronic
board design. It will also be suitable for students in electrical and electronic
engineering and related disciplines to support courses in test development and
design-for-test.
Colin Maunder is a consultant in computer-aided testing at BT Laboratories, UK. He is
well known internationally for his courses on design-for-test and his work on IEEE
Std 1149.1. He received a major IEEE Computer Society award for leading the
development of this important new standard for design-for-test and is currently
Emeritus Chair of the international working group that is enhancing and maintaining
the standard.
