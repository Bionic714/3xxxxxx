      :   |  Just as a public service for those who are still in    |   :
      |   |  the dark about GTA.  There were a lot of rumors and    |   |
      |   |  fake fixes around yesterday.  Here's the truth         |   |
      |   |                                                         |   |
      |   |  1. This is not a codec issue.  Several people have     |   |
      |   |  gotten the extracted movies to play by adding them     |   |
      |   |  to another game.                                       |   |
      |   |                                                         |   |
      |   |  2. There is a big difference between a game just       |   |
      |   |  requiring you to update your firmware, and a game      |   |
      |   |  actually USING the new firmware.  GTA is designed      |   |
      |   |  to run on 2.0 firmware and uses features just not      |   |
      |   |  available on 1.x.                                      |   |
      |   |                                                         |   |
      |   |  So whats the solution? Buy 2 psps! One for             |   |
      |   |  homebrew, and one for retail games.  But seriously,    |   |
      |   |  this game of cat and mouse between sony and            |   |
      |   |  homebrew developers is not going to end anytime        |   |
      |   |  soon, so get used to it.                               |   |
      |   |                                                         |   |
      |   |                                                         |   |
