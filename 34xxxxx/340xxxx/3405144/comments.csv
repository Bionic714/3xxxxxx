,geton786,2008-06-19T02:54Z,"I presume the files are copied from LP-all working, but no good quality and humming.
I found another torrent from LFeat, think form CD."

,froggyt,2009-02-07T09:27Z,"The sound quality of the album ""Ain't Had Enough Fun"" is very good.   I listened to the title track from ""Feats don't fail me now"" and it was obviously an LP dub: Dull, slightly fast, and noisy. "
,daycab,2009-07-21T05:47Z,"Awesome fucking collection.  Little Feat is the most under-rated group EVER!  The bad part is you'll have a hell of a time redoing all of the tags, but it's worth it."
,GhostOnes,2011-06-22T08:16Z,"seeeeeeeeeed, please."
,burningrabbit,2011-08-14T19:46Z,Little Feat died when Lowell George did.
