,fnog,2006-07-11T00:10Z,its crap dont dl it it is not even the full game its juts 1 file. and currently there are no windows turrents for this game.
,cancerbombs,2008-04-17T05:56Z,"Do not listen to fnog, he's kind of retarded. This is not the full game, it's a no CD crack that will allow you to play myst V without a crack, and it works fine."
,cancerbombs,2008-04-17T06:03Z,"Err, that is, without a CD."
,dschinny,2008-07-13T17:51Z,"Works great, thanks for the upload!"
,incense,2008-10-21T19:24Z,"i managed to install the game (without following the instructions by the others on the game torrent though, didnt download antiblaxx or anything, but i found a way...) but when i pressed play, it asked me to insert the original disc...:S 

so i figured i might needed this crack? is that my problem?

anyways i dl this crack, but when i try to unrar, it says it can't start because bindw32.dll doesn't exist. what do i do now?

however, somehow i managed to get an iso-file from the crack, but when i try to mount it with magiciso (daemon tools doesnt work due to ""error in command line""), it just goes back to the rar-file, and sometimes it just says the whole thing stopped working... please help.

how do i get the game to work?"
,daisy111,2009-01-10T20:30Z,"Ok, so I downloaded the game, and Alcohol to run it.  Seems to have installed ok, but got an error about ""access violation"" when I tried to play.

So I figured I needed this crack... I copied the eoa.exe file into the Myst folder, but still get the same message.

Any ideas what's wrong?"
