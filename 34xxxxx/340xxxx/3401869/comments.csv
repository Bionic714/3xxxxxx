,bhobson333,2011-10-20T15:24Z,"For clarity, this is the Original Broadway Cast version which was released on vinyl before the movie was made, with Ian Gillan of Deep Purple singing the part of Jesus; IMHO the best version, but I guess the first one you heard is always the best.  :-)

And Bhobson333, I fully agree that the London version outstrips the film soundtrack by far â&#x20AC;&#x201D; though I do think Carl Anderson was a pretty awesome Judas."
,Tolsta Girl,2012-04-28T01:42Z,"Anyone know if there was one round about 1968?  Someone is looking for one that he thinks Rod Stewart and/or Elton John were on.  He had had an old vinyl LP in the late 60's, but it was played to death!"
,Tolsta Girl,2012-04-28T01:57Z,"Is there an even earlier version - about 1967/8?  Someone has asked me to try and find one from then.  He had had an LP with people like Rod Stewart and/or Elton John on it, but it got played to death.  He seemed to think it was released even before they got funding to do the film or musical."
