This is a very rare record from the swedish band Tages. They did a temporarily namechange to Blond, attempting to reach the brittish musicmarket in the late 60´s. The record is far more complex and different from their swedish releases.
However, in competition with the uk popgiants, they didn´t succeéd & the record unfortunatly fell into oblivion...

So fans of the sixties, here´s a chance to rediscover a forgotten treasure :)

Enjoy....
