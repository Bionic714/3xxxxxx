As you guys may be aware, seems each region of the US, has originated its own form type of urban music, Texas began the 'chopped and & screwed' ; Flordia/Geogia started that Booty/Bass Music, 69 Boyz, etc.

Well Baltimore, Started with name simple enough, Balitmore Club Music, and it's sound is different, it's Rap Over House...

The Sound Is Different, and I could care less if you guys seed this 1:1, if you really want to help/thank, post comments of your opinion of this music, if you know artists that sound similar, and upload Baltimore Club Music of your own, hopefully, there will be a genre 'Baltimore Club' on the major torrent sites, eventually...

To all the sceeners/releasers, this music exists, how come no releases?

Seriously, if you don't like this, you don't like music...

Also, I included three bonus Baltimore Club Music Songs, which are totally seprate from this album and DJ, yet included for the people that may have a little bit of interest in Baltimore Club...

Rather Have Comments, Than For You To Seed 1:1
