Considered Godard?s finest film, ?LE MEPRIS? (Contempt) is a sublime mediation on absurdity, compromise and integrity ? in art and in relationships. Based on the novel by Alberto Moravia and starring Brigitte Bardot, Jack Palance, Michel Piccoli and Fritz Lang.

When aspiring playwright Pal Javal (Michel Piccoli) is called in as a script doctor on a film version of ?The Odyssey?, he is caught between a director (Fritz Lang) who wants to capture the reality of Homer?s world, and crass producer Prokosch (Jack Palance) who just wants more mermaids. As his artistic integrity gradually succumbs to the power of Prokosch?s cheque book, his wife Camille (Bardot) regards him with increasing contempt.
