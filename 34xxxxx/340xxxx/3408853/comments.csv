,Evertie,2009-07-11T19:33Z,"Nice dude! only one problem with AES, if I update this scenery to version 1.04, AES doesn't see that is has been updated to 1.04, any help? (AES doesn't work with 1.01)"
,Evertie,2009-07-11T19:36Z,"Sorry, problem solved already, thanks for this great product!"
,Evertie,2009-07-12T10:38Z,"No, problem not solved yet, can someone crack the update to v 1.04? if you install the default one it will change to a trial period. And I want to use AES for this airport!"
