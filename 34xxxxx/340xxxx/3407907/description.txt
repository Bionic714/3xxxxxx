n 1967 an Atlanta resident Clem Darracott, read that this was to be Ben Hogan's last Masters in Augusta. He was an ordinary man with an extraordinary hero...and an 8mm home movie camera.

Clem arrived at Augusta on the second day of the practice rounds, hoping for a shot of Hogan. What happened next exceeded his expectations. Ben Hogan allowed Clem to roll the film and step inside the ropes. Hogan, the man who never allowed himself to see film of his performances, permitted this amateur to take footage on the practice range and follow him out on the course.
