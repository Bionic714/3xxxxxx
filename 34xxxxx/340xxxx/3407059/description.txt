My first Torrent so I hope all goes well.  Anyway...

This is the big fight between Ichigo and Byakuya that is about to take place in the Bleach anime.  I've labled it the "Ban Kai Fight" for reasons you'll see inside.  The fight takes place in Manga chapter's 160 through 167, and it'll most likely fall into Anime ep's 58-60 (I'm guessing though)

The actual fansubbed manga was translated by Manga-Rain, but I've stolen all of the fan-colored images from Manga Rain, M7 and Silhouette and included them.
I've also omitted all of the useless chatter from sub-characters, just to focus on the fight.

This is a HUGE spoiler for what's to come in the anime, so unless you really want to know, I advice you don't download it.

Thanks,
