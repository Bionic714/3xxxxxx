[V],ZarquoN,2006-01-04T07:52Z,(don't know what happened to the old comments) but it is wierd that you are unable to open the files. have you tried burning and playing in a standalone dvd-player?
[V],ZarquoN,2006-01-04T19:20Z,"Yeah, i'm the one who created this release. and I've burnt it to a dvd, and it works perfectly. also I was able to open the files on my computer. I've deleted the files from my harddrive, and am now downloading (24 hours left) it from here - this way I'll be able to see if there are corrupt files or anything."
[V],ZarquoN,2006-01-15T23:19Z,You do that... check back and tell me how it went.
,pingis08,2006-01-26T16:13Z,How do you burn this release to a dvd? Which program should you use? 
[V],ZarquoN,2006-01-27T00:15Z,I use Nero Burning Rom.  http://www.videohelp.com/nerodvd.htm
,Penrod,2006-01-27T18:32Z,"I get the files working on my computer in all the below mentioned programs, however though the menu isnt working properly (you cant click on the buttons and guide yourself). My question though is how to burn these files so I can play them on my regular DVD-player when there is no img-file? Can someone plz help me out?

Off the record: What is the name of the song that is playing in the menu?  
"
[V],ZarquoN,2006-02-13T00:23Z,"Penrod > The song is ""Hilary Duff - Come Clean"". 


DVD-menus usually aren't working properly in VLC. Have you tried it in WinDVD?

If you want to burn the DVD, use this guide:  http://www.dvdshrink.info/nero-video.php  (A Flash-move. Click the arrows at top right to go to next step)"

[V],ZarquoN,2006-04-24T11:55Z," reflexo >

No it's not the original DVD. I downloaded the TV-ripped episodes from the net, and created a custom DVD from them. (Which is stated in the NFO).

Actually, both season 1 and 2 are still out on torrent-sites. Search for Laguna Beach at www.isohunt.com and you'll find them! :)"
