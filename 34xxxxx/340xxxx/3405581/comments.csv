,BinaryMoses,2006-05-02T03:49Z,"Interestingly enough, one doesn't get ""better at English"", since english isn't a verb, it's a noun. A proper noun, to be precise.  You can't get better at house, for example, or better at North Dakota. One could use these books to get better at speaking, reading, or comprehending english. "
