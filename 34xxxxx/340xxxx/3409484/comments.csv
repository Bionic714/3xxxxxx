,Speedah,2007-07-21T00:12Z,It dont seem to work on Vista :
,seeda please,2007-07-30T14:33Z,This game owns
,thorgin,2007-08-30T16:00Z,"Hey Speedah. Download DOSbox from http://dosbox.sourceforge.net 
That should solve any problems you might be having. DOSbox should run on Vista, but I honestly don't know since i run XP. Good luck and hope you get the game running."
,winchester3,2007-09-24T04:46Z,I downloaded the torrent. Mount 'Raptor - Call of the Shadows.iso' with daemon tools then what... Nothing happens.  Help would be appreciated
,Hyper_Trance,2007-10-26T20:26Z,"How do you get this to work? I think I've installed it... some CARNAGE folder ended up on the C: drive. I run the Setup and then I run the RAP.exe file.. and then the screen goes black and nothing happens.

I know I played the demo ages ago, and I really want to play this again!"
,Hyper_Trance,2007-11-11T12:14Z,"I should mention that I got this to work. First I didn't notice thorgin's post about http://dosbox.sourceforge.net 

So I downloaded that program and started the game using DosBox. I had some problems though, since I don't have any American keyboard. So here's what I did:

I launched DosBox and then typed:

mount C D:\CARNAGE

(When I installed the game, a folder called CARNAGE ended up on the D: drive). Since I don't have any American keyboard, I had to hold down the Alt-key and press 58 (on the numerical keyboard) in order to write the : sign.

And Alt + 92, in order to write the \ sign.

After writing mount C D:\CARNAGE I pressed Enter, then it said:

Drive C is mounted as local directory d:\carnage\

Then I wrote C: and pressed Enter. It will then say C:\> instead of Z:\>

Now you can type DIR if you want to view all the files which has been mounted as the C: drive. It should say RAP EXE somewhere, so write RAP.EXE and press Enter. And the game will run! With sound and everything! Enjoy!"
,muumiviina,2007-11-25T18:11Z,is this full version??

,smatas,2010-03-31T00:31Z,Thanks Addley for this fabulous game! Brings back the glory days. Works perfect with dosbox under W7 x32 just as hyper_trance explained!  +1
