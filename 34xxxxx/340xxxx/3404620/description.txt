"John Cassavetes? directorial debut revolves around an interracial romance between Lelia (Lelia Goldoni), a light-skinned black woman living in New York City with her two brothers, and Tony (Anthony Ray), a white man. The relationship crumbles when Tony meets Lelia?s brother Hugh (Hugh Hurd), a talented dark-skinned jazz singer struggling to find work, and discovers the truth about Lelia?s racial heritage. Shot on location in Manhattan with a cast and crew made up primarily of amateurs, Cassavetes? Shadows is a visionary work that is widely considered the forerunner of the independent film movement."
