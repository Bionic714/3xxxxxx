Visual Studio 2005 Professional Edition DVD

  Microsoft offers Visual Studio 2005 Professional Edition for professional
  developers working alone or in small teams who build mission-critical,
  multi-tier applications. The Professional Edition expands on the Standard
  Edition feature set to include tools for remote server development and 
  debugging, SQL Server 2005 development, and a full, unconstrained 
  development environment.
                                                                                 
  Professional developers will enjoy unfettered access to the .NET Framework
  2.0, a robust, fully functional development environment, support for
  creating tools that extend the Visual Studio Integrated Development
  Environment    

SQL Server 2005 Developer Edition DVD

  Microsoft SQL Server 2005 Developer Edition enables developers to rapidly
  build and test data-driven solutions on SQL Server 2005. A highly reliable
  database platform for mission-critical applications, SQL Server 2005
  delivers high levels of availability and performance with enhanced security
  features. Although Developer Edition supports all the features of Enterprise
  Edition that allow developers to write and test applications that can use
  the features, Developer Edition is licensed for use only as a development
  and test system, not as a production server.

  Notes: Visual Studio 2005 Rro does carry SQL 2005 but its only a SQL Server
  2005 express edition.The SQL Server 2005 Developer Edition DVD itself is 
  over 2.8GB. It obviously has something that vs 2005 doesnt.
