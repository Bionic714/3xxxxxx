For this duet set from the 1975 Montreux Jazz Festival (a Fantasy date that has been reissued on CD in the OJC series), Bill Evans alternates between acoustic and electric pianos while Eddie Gomez offers alert support and some near-miraculous bass solos. The audience is attentive and appreciative as they should be for the communication between the two masterful players (on such songs as "Milano," "Django," "I Love You" and their encore "The Summer Knows") is quite special.
