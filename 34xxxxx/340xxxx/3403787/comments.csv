[V],Horrorspoke,2011-03-29T11:14Z,"USA: 113 min (uncut version)

USA: 85 min (DVD version) 

Clearly states on IMDB that the uncut version is 113mins. Some rumour......."
,PiraatBae,2012-04-25T10:55Z,"Because IMDB is never in error, right?

Of course, while you were looking this up on IMDB, you apparently failed to notice the discussion on the Lemora page regarding this supposed ""uncut"" version which actually clears this up.  Let me quote for you:

""The Synapse DVD is uncut. Director Blackburn confirms as much in the audio commentary.""

Hmm, well if the actual Director of the film says there is no ""uncut"" 113 minute version in the commentary on this actual DVD, I would probably believe him.  Another comment:

""The 113 minute version running time is a bunch of bunk, actually. The error started when Moore Video put out LEMORA on VHS many years ago and included the running time of their documentary as part of the total running time, causing the confusion.""

There we are.  Urban legend debunked."
