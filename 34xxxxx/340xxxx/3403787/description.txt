And this is my Halloween treat for freakyflicks!

Richard Blackburn's low-budget 1975 horror film, "Lemora: A Child's Tale of the Supernatural", is an example of one of those rare films that manages to rise above its limited production quality and financing to become something special and enduring.

Plotwise, the film follows a young Christian girl (Lila Lee, portrayed by Cheryl Smith), the daughter of a wanted gangster, who leaves her home town to visit her father on the death bed. As it turns out this is all a set up, and Lila soon finds herself under the spell of a female vampire called Lemora. She is the leader of some sort of religious cult in a small village deep into the woods and she plans to initiate the young girl in the cult´s activities. The young girl, sensing that something is wrong, flees from Lemora´s grasp and tries to find a way out of the labyrinthine woods. But will she make it?
