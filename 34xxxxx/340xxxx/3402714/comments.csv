How about the password, knarph - or even better remove the DRM protedtion yourself and post the tunes as MP3s

Thanks."

To be fair the back tracking isn't bad and the covers of Michelle is good, but most of the singing sounds like a piss-poor Beatle cover from a kids bop album, and Run For Your life is so bad it will make John and George roll over in there grave. 
Avoid this and just get Rubber Sole and just get Michelle but not any others or be prepared to bleed from the ears!"
