This is the fourth dvd game i have tried with and get this message. I have tried with 1 cd game and it works fine. Am i doing something wrong.

,Shin00bism,2008-04-01T07:39Z,"So far my Generic-Brand DVD-R has worked great. It's top-of-the-line generic DVD-R discs. 

The games that haven't worked well, I also tested on Sony DVD+R, and the same issues occur there. So it's not the disc. Vice-versa, sometimes I chose to use Sony and the games worked fine (back-ups of back-ups etc). 

Some brands might be good to avoid but cheap-ass Corporate Express brand cd/dvds work. I work for that shitty company so I get them cheap. "

,Siovhan,2010-03-20T11:39Z,"@ Abbe91 or anyone else needing help playing copied games:

go here and one of these people can install the program (free mcboot) to your memory card which will allow you to play copied games:
http://psx-scene.com/forums/showthread.php?t=58851

you can download games from thepiratebay or warez-bb or filecrop, then download a program called ESR patcher and patch the .iso files you download. if the game is pal and you need ntsc (or ntsc & u need pal) you also need to patch the iso 

with a program called pal2ntsc or ntsc2pal.

then burn the iso at 4x or 2x with ImgBurn (or whatever program you want to burn with)."

,xDonarudo,2012-04-30T01:13Z,I was able to run the game successfully but there are a few bugs in the game for me. I'm using PCSX2 ps2 emulator. There are these weird faded shadows or textures with low opacity. They are the original game texture but doubled up its hard to explain. also at times there are scratchy bugs on the surfaces of objects and glitches. How do I fix this? I think it's the game itself
