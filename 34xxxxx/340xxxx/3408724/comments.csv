,onani,2006-04-08T14:56Z,There's something wrong with this. On the first cd the autorun doesn't work. The setup file comes up with an error 'program too big to fit in memory'. Anyone know how to get it working or should I write it off as a dud?

,CadreOne,2006-05-09T19:34Z,"
 Yeah, I think I'm having the same problem as 'gwd' had.. I installed the game via DAEMON, mounting both of the .cue files, but when I try to play the game with either of them mounted, it says I have the wrong CD inserted. What is it that I need to do?"
,campar,2006-05-10T17:34Z,get a crack!
,CadreOne,2006-05-11T06:43Z,"
 Well, I got some help with my last problem, found the Crack folder. But when I execute the file, it says it's missing 'granny2.dll'. So I went and downloaded 'granny2.dll', but I can't do anything with it because when I try to throw it in there, I get an error telling me the files are read-only and that I can't drag or paste any files into the drive. I assume this is because it's a virtual drive.. But what do I do now?"
,campar,2006-05-12T14:20Z,onani get at bigger Harddrive!
,campar,2006-05-12T14:46Z,plz seed from 50kb/s to 2Kb/s

,Drkr0,2007-04-06T07:38Z,"I have Put the Crack in the ReleaseExe folder and i have downloaded Grann2.dll but when i try to start the game it says that it cannot find _GrannyGetControlCompletionCheckFlag@4 

Please i need some help i really would like to play the game!"
,athanatis,2007-04-17T12:01Z,"Hey guys, you don't just run the crack from where it is on the CD. Download the stuff, mount the CDs on a virtual drive, install the game, then copy the crack from the crack folder and paste it into the directory called ReleaseExe IN THE GAME DIRECTORY ON C:\, NOT ON THE CD. The game works fine that way. You don't need to copy or download anything onto the CD images."
,radeon05,2007-04-30T15:41Z,"I cant find the crack folder, i can find the release exe folder but not the crack, can you help me please"
,radeon05,2007-04-30T17:33Z,There isnt even a crack folder there
,Puppet2000,2007-06-11T17:13Z,Seed please.
,Puppet2000,2007-06-12T22:32Z,"When I do all the stuff with the crack and download granny2.dll, I get a message saying ""The procedure entry point_GrannyGetControlCompletionCheckFlag@4 could not be located in the dynamic link library granny2.dll."" Please help, someone."
,Maxy_Dawg,2007-07-09T17:51Z,"MrSchmidt, you have a good question. It's in the ReadMe file in the Start Menu (Start>All Programs>Evil Genius). This is the UK version.

PS- I found the crack, applied it, ran the game, and got absolutly  NO GRANNY ERROR. I have no idea what could cause this except that the crack might not be applied correctly. My graphics card sucks, so I'm suprised it runs on mine, but it does actually run."
,Maxy_Dawg,2007-07-09T17:53Z,"PSS- I haven't patched my copy yet, so maybe that's the problem"
,firedark11,2007-07-18T18:14Z,do u have to buy the granny thing?
,firedark11,2007-07-18T22:34Z,where is the release exe folder ????

,fritte13465,2007-09-23T03:51Z,Where is the crack?
,Refrigeratist,2007-10-11T16:36Z,"mozes540 i have the same problem you used to have. The one with the maid, my minions wont interrigate. How did you solve your problem?"
,supermegeme,2007-10-15T02:16Z,"wow 1 gib, well from the looks of the game, its great. "
,freeloader14,2007-10-20T15:32Z,"To Refrigeratist: To interrogate the maid you must right click on the miad, click on the interrogate tab, and then right click on the interrogation chair. if you do not have a holding cell or interrogation chair, get one."
,LUSRIL,2007-11-26T00:09Z,"lol ok guys listen, for all those that have problems. 

1st step use Deamon(spellcheck) or Alcohol. 
Load up the 1st Image called Mo-evil1 or Mo-evil .CUE onto your Alcohol or Deamon tools. when it says the media has loaded its time for step 2

2nd step. go to my computer and you will see the EVil Genius CD (install), right click on it and open it, you will see a crack folder copy that to your desktop. 

3rd step exit out of all that and install the game, still with the 1st mo-evil 1 loaded... half way through the installation you will get a ""insert CD #2 which leads to 4rth step

4rth step go back to your Deamon tools and Alcohol and eject the mo-evil 1 and load up Mo-evil 2.CUE or just the regular one.. whichever  it excepts. once mo-evil 2 is loaded, go back to your installation and click continue. 

5th step. installation should be complete. and yes i know it says ""WRONG CD"" if you hit play Evil genius. go to program files.. or wherever you saved the installation files to... go there and open up that folder. in that folder you will see a file that says Release.exe (something like that) go in there and scroll up and down until you fine a file that says ""EvilGeniusExeStub-Release""... 

6th step go back to that Crack folder that you copied to your desktop. open it it should say the same name. now copy that file.. and open up that folder where it contains the one you just found and replace. 

7th step, load up the 1st mo-evil on your alcohol or d - tools. and play the game ^_~


enjoy "
,JoshuaSmtih,2008-01-01T03:04Z,I can't seem to get it to work can somebody just make a ready to play version? Please?
,JoshuaSmtih,2008-01-01T04:15Z,"One with the crack file all ready, you just have to put in in the right place."
,JoshuaSmtih,2008-01-01T22:58Z,I borrowed the installation disc from my friend and burned the play disc is there an easier way to just use the burned disc to play this game.  If so please post it here. Thanks
,Senso,2008-01-24T04:06Z,"It works perfectly with LUSRIL's blurb, I don't understand where there is so much whining."
,xdaoyu,2008-02-20T19:30Z,"Thanks!! Got this game to install no problem, works fine except for the bugs present in the game itself.
Speaking of which, if there's anyone on here who has a copy of the eu version of the update (or a working link to one) they'd be kind enough to up/post, I'd be in your debt. Can't find it anywhere, and I'd love to get rid of as many bugs as possible from this great game :) Funny I could find the fixed .exe for the eu update no prob, but not the patch itself..."
,CarnageHeart,2008-03-13T07:51Z,"You know... I wish I still had my old download of this... didn't have any problems, was able to play the game with out the need of a crack."
,Anbumedic,2008-03-14T21:59Z,It is in the First one not the second.
,damankazam,2008-04-30T00:03Z,"I'm having trouble with the install.  Everytime i try to install it it tells me it can't copy audioresource.erb, and it gives me the option to abort the install or just ignore the file.

If i chose to ignore the file than the game just crashes after i try to boot it up when the instal is done.

anyone know whats going on?"
,Workingtitle,2008-06-07T22:18Z,"I can't seem to find the install files to put in the crack, can anyone tell me where to find these. "
,ahasan93,2008-06-24T18:14Z,"To all that are having trouble -
Download
Mount and Install via Daemon Tools
Go to www.gamecopyworld.com search for Evil Genius, and download
(Evil Genius v1.0 [ENGLISH] No-CD/Fixed EXE)
Extract and copy the file into the ReleaseExe folder in your Evil Genius game folder
Worked for me."

,GodSend171,2008-10-08T05:08Z,LUSRIL you are the bomb. Anyone having trouble with it should go to page two and look at his comment it has step by step instructions and I also can tell why it is like that.
,orrange,2008-11-28T23:33Z,Worked great for me after I read the comments on how to install the game.

Wasnt easy... apparently patches for a game dont last on the internet for 5 years or more... especially the EU version. "
,XenoWarrior,2009-04-05T05:27Z,"Just downloaded, but when i mount on daemon tools, says autorun gets some problem or other. 'My computer' freezes when i try to right-click the mounted CD.

Any ideas?"
