Hi,  I posted the CD Image of this setup, but the CD Image doesnt want to work, so I tried several time to create a freaking CD Image, so now I'm tired I just send the setup.exe I create to install Age of Empire 3 on any windows (doesnt need the windows xp like the real setup want)

Like I said on the other torrent, this is 100 % safe, no virus, trojan, backdoor, only the game with the no cd crack include (scanned with kaspersky)

If someone can create a DVD Image, I know a lot of people will be happy if you share it with us.  Like I said this is only the setup.exe
