This torrent was uploaded a few days ago (last Tuesday, I think) I sincerely hope the torrent works. If other people than kedvenc have similar problems, please post comments here; I'll be checking this page from time to time. The thing is that my dvd-rom recorder recently broke down. The problem developed gradually. Therefore it is not impossible there are some read/write errors on this particular torrent, even though I did a quick, rough check on it as always before uploding. This means that if there is a problem, I'll have to upload the whole film again. Unfortunately for those of you who really want it, this would mean that you'd have to download the whole thing again. You can check the film prior to burning it to dvd, using daemon tools or similar virtual burning-to-HDD software. The situation also means I won't upload Claire's Summer until I get my new dvd-rom unit since I no longer trust my current hardware unit. I will check to see if kedvenc's comment matches my original dvd disc. If I have uploaded a corrupt video, I apologize deeply to all of you.
