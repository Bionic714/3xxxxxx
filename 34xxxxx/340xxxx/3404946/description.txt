Gene allocates the roles of stylists, manager and stage designers and then leaves the children on their own to work out how to perform together as a band. He then takes the Deputy Headmistress back to his home in LA and as his date for the American Music Awards. While he's away the band struggles to write and learn a song, and chaos breaks out as they turn on the lead singer for failing to sing in tune and on beat. Gene returns to announce that their first gig singing "Wild Thing" is to be in front of the children's parents in the school theatre.
