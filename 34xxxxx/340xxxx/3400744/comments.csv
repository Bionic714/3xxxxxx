,Swi7ch,2006-04-10T00:17Z,"Come on seed!
I'm not even at 1%"
,Tech-Noir,2006-05-06T13:27Z,"Sorry for not responding to the persons trying to download, I have been quite busy the past month or so.

Anyways, I will be seeding now for anyone who wants to download it. Right now the tracker seems to be off tho.

Should the requests for this album be big enough I will probably delete this torrent and then re-upload it. If so I will let you know."
,newholborn,2006-05-18T15:07Z,"dude, that's excellent. A+"
,darknm,2006-05-31T01:52Z,Seriously this is GREAT everything dosent sound all jumbled and thrown together like in the retail version and you can actually hear the insturments.. will be seeding this forever. 
,Rumor,2006-07-02T05:30Z,Doesn't seem to want to UnStuff itself properly.
,Tech-Noir,2006-07-07T01:36Z,"How do you mean Unstuff?

If you mean unpack, you should only have to use WinRAR (which is free) to unpack it. IF you are using WinRAR, are you getting any error messages? Bittorrent checks files constantly for inconsistencys and such, so if you have the entire thing downloaded, it should be bit for bit the exact same file I uploaded, which means it should work. Sorry I cannot help in any othr way. :/"

,knoxville666,2007-04-20T20:19Z,seeeddddd!!!!
,dudedudesson,2007-06-02T19:04Z,"Dude, Your the man, this rocks!
Can't you do this to the older albums too ?  it would be very nice.. "
,Tech-Noir,2007-06-13T01:31Z,"Hehe, thanks for the comment. ;)

People have asked me if I could do it to the older albums, but for me IOWA is very good soundwise. Everything is aidible and it's not fatiguing to listen to.

As for The Selftitled, I just feel that they would need to re-record it to improve on it. It's mixed and equalized in a way where just working on a stereo track is very limiting. You can't really bring out the high-end in the vocals a bit without making the cymbals unbearable to listen to, etc.

Vol.3 has some issues with muted low- and high-end, but the tracks are very well-mixed and consistently recorded throughout the album. TO fix the ST I would need to spend ages to get a slightly improved end-result. So I probably won't  do those, you'll have to live with them. ;)"
,Skullah,2007-06-21T21:10Z,SEEED PLEASE
,Tech-Noir,2007-07-17T19:35Z,"By the way, would anyone be interested in a ""remaster"" of Metallicas ""Master Of Puppets""?

I managed to find a FLAC of the album, which was already remastered (some time ago, and no real noticeable differences besides volume).

I'll probably up it in a few days."
,TurboJuMP,2007-08-18T10:01Z,"Hi! I'm very interested in this torrent... Can somebody seed it, please?"
,wessman44,2007-08-20T05:05Z,"wow man. i am very interested in downloading this.   can someone seed?

This looks awesome dude."
,wessman44,2007-08-20T07:31Z,"Someone help: It says there are 3 seeders, but the torrent wont begin to download.

I already own the original album, but i really want to see the difference! Thank you tech- it looks like you really put a lot of time into this."
,TurboJuMP,2007-08-21T06:26Z,"You can download this from RapidShare, but I'm not allowed to insert links..."
,kklimeck102,2007-10-04T05:51Z,SEED!! SEED!! SEED!! 
,Tech-Noir,2008-01-29T13:22Z,"Well, this I just made for fun and to ""try something I hadn't done before"" a few years ago. I never intended it to be a serious attempt at mastering, obviously. Even at the time I knew that mp3 isn't the right way to go hehe.

The fact that it says ""Remastered"" in the title is purely because that is a description that most people can infer something from.

Also, the source material isn't suited for any kind of manipulation, even if it had been in flac. Having more experience now I know that, and I wouldn't waste my time with it now. But when I did it, it was a fun little thing to try out effects, methods and such on. I share dit because, even if it was still crap, I found it to be easier to listen to, and without having the ability to do a proper poll among the people who have downloaded it, the comments atleast have shown that some found redeeming qualities in it (It might not sound better, but it does sound different).

So please don't take it too seriously mate. ;)


However, if you have any criticism, not mentioning the obvious shortcomings in file format and such, do let me know. But keep in mind this was my first experience with manipulating and changing tracks in this manner.

Perhaps you'd like to listen to a later example, for example Metallicas ""Black Album"", and see what you think about it. It would probably be a better example for judging the audio quality, since it was made more recently. There is also a lossless copy there, since the source material was the album in flac format. I'd like any input, even criticism (criticism is often preferred, since the most information about what things could have been done differently, etc, can usually be derived from those). :)"
,Derrick4Real,2008-02-07T13:31Z,"I personally am interested in DL this. I think the way the CD was matered originally is horrible. Very flat!

Whether you mastered it in mp3 or FLAC...its gotta be better than the orig

Much Thanks!"
,broskeet91,2008-03-17T20:50Z,Slipknot is intense like crazy!!!!!
,kungk3,2008-05-09T23:10Z,what program do i use to open rar files??
,Tech-Noir,2008-05-11T09:23Z,"Google is your friend. ;)


The best one is WinRAR.

Choose your language, download, install, and then you will be able to click on rarfiles and extract data from them. :)"
,Lavatex,2008-06-13T00:39Z,1/kts :(
,Galabrotix,2008-07-13T17:05Z,"Very nicely done, you should consider doing some Killswitch Engage remasters."
,Tech-Noir,2008-07-13T18:18Z,"Any particular KSE release you feel needs improving, and how? :)"
,maruku84,2008-07-18T19:59Z,"interesting d\l, good work i'm anxious to hear your other work, also you should consider doing their first album or at least surfacing, it is probably my fav album/song.love the fact that you save to both flac and 320 kbit mp3's. i have issues with low quality stuff i wont d\l stuff under 256, it feel like it is scratching my ears if i do. 192 works in a pinch though."
,Wundermutt,2008-07-30T13:54Z,"Wow, Im gonna seed this one forever!  Nice job Tech-Noir!"
,Galabrotix,2008-08-03T03:33Z,"I think End Of Heartache and As Daylight Dies, sorry took me so long to get back to you lol. I'll seed this up for sure."
,Tech-Noir,2008-08-04T00:47Z,"Galabrotix:

Hehe, that's funny, because if I could choose one of their albums to optimize/change it would be ""Alive Or Just Breathing"".
The others I don't think I could make any better. I might boost the bass slightly, but those 2 albums are pretty much spot on as far as I'm concerned, when it comes to equalization, tone, clarity etc. I'd even consider using ""A D D"" as a reference for what is great recording and mastering. :)

Look out for AOJB optimized though, I'll up it when I get a chance. You might change your mind. :)

Out of curiosity, what was it about those 2 albums you didn't like or felt could be improved, if there was some niggly thing that has bothered you for example. :)

Cheers for seeding!"
,514IN,2008-08-06T19:22Z,Great upload! It makes this album actually more enjoyable to listen to. SEED guys!
,Zzyth,2008-08-29T02:37Z,looks great cant wait to DL thx Tech-Noir 
,R.Langdon,2008-09-11T05:36Z,"What the?? 

 When I downloaded this, is was ""All Hope Is Gone"". "
,tective,2008-09-30T16:50Z,has no tags at all.
[T],480v,2010-03-12T02:52Z,"I must say I actually like Slipknot because of this custom remaster. Sounds much cleaner. So I went and downloaded their other albums in flac...and now I remember why I never got into them. No matter how much I tried messing with eq or tried tweaking the sound on my DAP, I couldn't get it to sound right. The sound was noisy, chaotic and made the band sound like crap & most all I felt like i was getting a headache. That's probably why I was really never into them. But after listening to this remaster...I realize they're actually really good. Its really a shame that this remaster done by a fan sounds so much better. "
,jameshampshire,2010-07-03T09:18Z,amazing job dude!
,ATO1982,2012-07-25T12:27Z,"I must say I am NOT as impressed as everyone else.
In fact I am disappointed.
It feels like all you did was boost the bass too much, honestly.
Sorry! I'm just being honest.
At least the fuzziness that was on the original album is gone, so this one is slightly more listenable.. just too much bass.
The original/normal version gave me a headache, literally."
,ATO1982,2012-07-26T22:33Z,"Well, after listening to it a bit more and comparing them I've realized it actually is a lot better than what it seemed the first time.
Again, it is a bit too bassy for my taste but it is so much more listenable than the original.
You should keep doing more remasters!"
