,rockstar11998,2008-03-05T19:35Z,Islam is not what it seems.  It is a continuation of the old testament beliefs in forcing others to believe or be slaughtered.  Now this killing of nonbelievers only pertained to the promised land that the Jews were taken from.  They had justification.  Islam has no justification for killing others.  Only that they want to force their religion on others and create a society where men are superior to women which allows for the abuse of women to prevail.  Satan is so finely wrapped up in this perversion of Christianity and Judaism its not funny.  Muhammad is one of those false prophets foretold about in the new testament.  Not all Muslims are in full knowledge of the core beliefs of Islam therefore they think it is a peaceful religion.  Then why did it get its start by slaughtering others?  Very contradictory don't you think.  Learn some history people.  Watch all of the documentaries you can so as not be ill-informed by misguided or deceitful Muslims.
