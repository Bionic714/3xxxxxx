,boloz,2006-02-19T11:41Z,"Gees it took a long time but was well worth it, thanks black ignis...dvd works like a charm. subtitles, sound, everything worked with no problems at all.
Looking at all these comments about trouble and not one person mentions UltraISO? downloaded UltraISO from this website, opened THIS iso file with UltraISO and burned to a blank DVD...easy as that!!"

,ProZap,2006-04-05T12:10Z,"Stegron just use DVD decrypter (http://www.free-codecs.com/download/DVD_Decrypter.htm) on ISO files, it will make you a VIDEO_TS folder and just burn that one in nero under DVD-Video."

good point ultraiso is a good burning program and if you can't get that one to work try using alchohol120 its another great alternative since nero isn't the be all of end all and for this sort of stuff is maybe on the level of decent in comparison."
,neo166,2007-10-29T18:14Z,Hey is this DVD in PAL or NTSC?
,Death_Seraph,2008-05-01T11:26Z,"Well everything is okay with the movie except the english subtitles. They're not very good, I mean they work but many names and words are wrong like these: 
Shinra (the way it should be translated)=Shanlo (in the movies subtitles)
Yes or Yeah was translated to Um... (really it was translated to Um...)
And there are many more mistakes, I know this since I know a little japanese."
,3261dan,2008-05-07T19:34Z,"There are fan-made subtitle on here somewhere. They will obviously be a lot better than the crap that it comes with...

 Funny how fan-made stuff always out-classes proffessional gear :)"
