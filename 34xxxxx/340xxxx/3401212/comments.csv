,catweazl,2006-02-14T22:33Z,"This download work great with Daemon Tools but unfortunately you have to use it from the image with Deamon Tools.  It will not work once burned to a DVD, even if burned from ""Deamon DVD rom drive.""  Hope this helps people that still can't get this working."

,jabbashouse,2006-09-12T21:21Z,"Dear Members,

I have tried both ways to mount it, with Deamon Tools and Alcohol 120%, and every time i mount and install it says that my MSFS 2004 needs the 9.1 patch. But i have already installed the patch.

This version doesn't recognize that my MSFS 2004 has already been update to 9.1 patch, so i can't even get passed the installation process.

Thank you,

Jabbashouse."
,AllRightDan,2006-10-21T23:05Z,"Hello, I had trouble installing Traffic 2005, With Daemon Tools 4 installation doesn't start and with Alcohol 120% it's asking for the original CD.

It's working with the following steps :

I run Virtual CD-Hide v1.0.0.4, choose ""Hide all virtual drive""

Then I mount the .mdf file with Alcohol and installation start...

I do the same with the update and it's working too...

Let me know if it's working for you, thanks PopArt it's a great addon, I hope it will help the other users..."
