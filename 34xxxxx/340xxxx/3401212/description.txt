This is the DVD (image) release of this add-on (~1,70 GB) and should be mounted with Alcohol 120% or Deamon Tools.

Some features:
* Control Tower view.
* Drivable follow me vehicle.
* Includes Ai helicopter traffic.
* And ofcourse lots and lots of AI traffic, including the new generation Airbus A350, Boeing 787 Dreamliner and double deck ?super Jumbo? A380 and for supersonic fans even Concorde.

Considering the size of this add-on I will start seeding tonight at ~01.00 GMT and will continue seeding for some nights at a row. During daytime seeding will not continue on my part, so please no comments when seeding has temporarily stopped.


Happy landings,
