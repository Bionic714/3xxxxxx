Right now I'm stuck at 41%.
Any help is appreciated and I'll ofcourse keep seeding it afterwards.
Thanks,

Extraordinarily distracting (dub is from VHS so thy can't be removed).  Picture quaity is above average compated to a lot of other VHS rips I've seen, and - most important - the audio is excellent."
