,fresh_idea,2006-02-06T19:01Z,i just wonder what that 'German' label means
,FireStarterUT,2006-06-29T07:11Z,Nah you dont need btoh cds. I've played the game with only Leon CD it installs only that characters data. So I could only play with Leon. And with this cd you'll only be able to play with Claire.
