- Part 2: Only the Brave Are Free


Part 1: The Truth About Communism

The Truth About Communism presents the violent rise of the Soviet Empire from the Chaos of revolution to the terror of the
Cold War and is charted using remarkable footage of actual events. This is the best collection of historical film footage on
the topic of Communist Imperialism ever assembled.


Part 2: Only the Brave Are Free

Only the Brave Are Free is a classic film expos√© presenting the truth behind the Spanish Civil War and demonstrates how a
small group of infiltrators were able to capture the country while the majority were fooled by slogans of reform. A rare find
for both the student and the film collector.


Volume 3 in the Hidden Agenda series.
