This album is the second co-operation from Doc and Lena Selyanina. If their first album Distant Transmissions - Ambient Reflections on Bach (MT002) was focusing around the idea of space - 'cosmic Bach' if you wish -  this second album is characteristically a 'water album'. The theme of water is present at all levels: in the topics of the songs, in their tonal treatments and even in some sound material. The basic setting is still that of deep, meditative ambient, and as such the album should serve well as pleasant background music for meditations or relaxation. But above those slowly evolving ambient structures and the dark majesty of 'deep waters' there are also much swifter layers of music conveying the mystery, intimacy and sensuality associated with the element of water. The compositions are rich and sophisticated, rewarding a focused listener with a stunning variety of tonal structures, from virtuoso-spirited flights of passion to the glittering play of notes on parallel, alternative scales, much like the play of sunlight on the waves of an ocean.

The original works of Debussy that inspired this album and provided its musical raw material were: Danseuses de Delphes (Dancers in Mist), Voiles (Behind the Veils) and L'isle joyeuse (An Island of Joy).
