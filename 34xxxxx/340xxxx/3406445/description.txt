Here are two eBooks which I found elsewhere:
Wicca & Magick - A Beginner's Guide.pdf

and (a bit less tame, perhaps):

The Satanic Bible - Occultism, Satanism - Anton Lavey.pdf

I can recommend the first book (from my brief, albeit incomplete, perusal). 
The second book I'm only posting to get under the skin of these damn people
who are posting eBooks from the Catholic church without any explanation
and just a cryptic title so that we "collectors" end up seeding the file
several times before we find out what a load of garbage we've accidentally
downloaded. (You know who you are!!!)

Have fun and don't take this too seriously! ;-)
