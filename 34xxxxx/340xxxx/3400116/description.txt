Flight1 / DreamFleet's Baron 58 with Reality XP gauges!

http://www.dreamfleet2000.com/Previews/B58/preview_home.html

This package contains:
* original Flight1 Wrapper for the Baron 58.
* cracker wrapper (for those who don't have it yet).
* instructions on how to use this "old" cracker wrapper to unwrap newer
  (but not all) wrapped installers from Flight1.

It worked for me, it should work for you. Just read the Install.txt first!


Happy landings and have a nice weekend,
