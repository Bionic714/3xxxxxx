,alterbridgeboy,2008-10-02T18:46Z,"i have no idea how to do this cracker shit, i did what the install.txt said to do by typing the stuff in cmd and nothing happened just a bunch of stuff about processes and whatnot popped up, when i went to install it it wouldnt let me, how the hell do u do this since the instructions dont tell you shit"
,sacrayton,2008-12-07T21:23Z,"I agree. The instructions aren't worth a damn. They are confusing and seem to be missing soemthing. Why can't the installer be seeded and the hell with the rest of the bullshit. Besides, DOS is antiquated."
