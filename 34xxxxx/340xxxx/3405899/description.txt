Mamoru Oshii's The Red Spectacles.
Mamoru Oshii is the director of the anime Ghost in the Shell and also Patlabor.
But this is a movie not an anime, and it's quite special, but I liked it.
This is my first upload so beare with me if there are problems, I'll do as well as I'm able.
I shrak it with DVD Shrink 3.2 to about 63%, nothing it tossed out, and I included cover and disc scans.
If this goes well I could upload the two other Momoru Oshii movies I've got "Stray Dogs" and "Talking Head".
And if there's someone who can upload his movie Avalon, I'd be well pleased.
I'd like to see some Seijun Suzuki movies uploaded.

I'll seed as much as I can but sometimes I get disconected, so I repeat: pls. beare with me, OK?
