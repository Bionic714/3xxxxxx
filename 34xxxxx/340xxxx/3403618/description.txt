Rick's old school bike part2.

Aired: October 24 2005 on Discovery channel.

Fabrication continues on the Rick Bike, as the guys pitch in to finish this old school bike for Rick to keep. The bike heads to paint and Nub gets to give it a classic feel. Senior heads to the blacksmith to pick up the sisi bar that he and Mikey had created and delivers it to Rick. Then, all of the guys help with assembly.
