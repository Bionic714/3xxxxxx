Earth Rising The Series Vol. #1
Mind Control:A Brave New World or Enhancing Human Performance

Manipulation of the mind, emotions and physical health of people through
new applied technologies continues to draw the attention of military
planners around the world. Best selling author and lecture, Dr. Nick Begich
will present the most startling advances in this area of technology for
both military and private sector uses. The presentation will provide in
depth information, demonstrations, background and forecasts of development
of these areas of science as they affect our society and individual freedom.
Enhancing human performance or controlling human outcomes will be the
challenge of the century raising serious questions on the ethics of the
science of mind control. Control of the human mind by external means is
now a reality ? how we use this technology is the next challenge for this
generation.

Some very promising new technology I enjoyed this for some of the positive
news, Vol 2 is better though ;) More dirt on HAARP and police state tracking.
Should be released in next couple days. Enjoy."
