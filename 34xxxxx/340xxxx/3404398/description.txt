Cancelled after Acclaim shut down operations, this action game was in the final development stages when it was tabled. Based on the comic book created by Archangel Studios and Christian Gossett, The Red Star is a battle action game that centers on three different main characters. Set in an alternate Russia (URRS) where technology, magic, and futuristic weapons are wielded by its Red Fleet Army, The Red Star begins with Sorceress-General Maya Antares and the search for her missing husband, Marcus.
Features included ifferent play styles and abilities from character to character, 10 upgradable weapons, melee combat, and two-person cooperative play.
