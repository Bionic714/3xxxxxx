be careful you don't become what you claim to hate so much. curtis is clever and it is a polished product, but viewed from a objective perspective its more about the power of propaganda than anything else. curtis basically distorts and selectively uses history to support his conclusion. basically the crime he thinks the neocons and such are guilty of. over simplification to fit a grand narrative is the mistake of conspiracy theorists. and his need to draw parrallels between neocons and islamists forces him to stretch the truth. he relies on the viewers ignorance of history. and the sad thing is many will just eat it up.  you know what they say, a little knowledge is a dangerous thing."
,anti-oedipus,2006-01-23T19:44Z,"I disagree, this doc spins a much more acceptable narrative then the national review has ever done with the Iraq war. Sorry to hear that it hurts your sensitive neocon feelings."

But now, they have discovered a new role that restores their power and authority. Instead of delivering dreams, politicians now promise to protect us ....

from nightmares.

This documentary is trully great for many people. But some people are afraid of it I guess that is why Adam Curtis, cannot get it broadcasted in the US."

,mrlins,2006-10-23T10:57Z,"This is a very well made documentary that you should watch with an open mind and then form your own opinion. 
Sadly, it's obvious that some people have been raised never to question their government or country and I understand why a series like this would 'bother' them. "
,MikeReevez,2007-08-07T00:35Z,"Before you insinuate that the historical facts in this doc are wrong you might want to spend some time reading up on your history. Sadly w00t you missed the whole point. But like already stated some will never question their way of life. True it paints a not so enlightened America picture Adam Curtis was trying to give you TRUE historical facts to show you how he has seen the reality of the situation. Yes it holds bias, there?s no way one can truly be unbiased with a pre built opinion. Simply being a republican or NEOcon will distort how you will view this doc as will I be effected by my pre built opinion. Another thing buckO ""over simplification to fit a grand narrative is the mistake of conspiracy theorists"" first don't you thing a conspiracy theorists view be more like ""The New World Order"". Witch you can merge with this doc and you can seem not so crazy. Simply put NWO=NeoCon, and reverse the side of religion the illuminate are on and pow! It all fits even groups like The Carlyle Group that by the way Bill Clinton is running for the Board of Directors"

Now I can show my friends like I did with Loose Change just to show them another perspective.  Woooter is a cheese, but i can see his point during CLinton campaign and in other segments where I'm sure it wouldn't be only the necons fault for the destruction or decline of something.  Definitely favored them thou.  Every lie has 80% truth and if this is just a distortion of the truth woooter then....... "

Thxs philfire!
I just got done reading that. That was extremely helpful of you and a nice change from the mental diarrhea that typically haunts the comments sections here on TPB.

@mrlins: The sheer willful ignorance of some never ceases to amaze, to frustrate, to dishearten me. The deluded hyper-nationalist Utopian fantasy of American government and its ""sacred mission"" is absolutely mind-bending."
,zzxzx,2010-02-09T04:51Z,"wOOter your argument is laughable
first off the 'review' you linked to was written by a man who wrote it ""After seeing a preview tape of the first installment of the three-part series""..
notwithstanding that the reviewer and the publication are STAUNCH right wing republican supporters... and his review clearly illustrates that he did not watch the film... in typical right wing fashion he attacks with his own weakness... he accuses adam curtis of broadbrushing the right wing while doing the exact same thing in his review ...
""The opening episode amounts to a ludicrously one-sided account of the rise of the neocons which manages to impute all manner of sinister motives to a tight-knit circle devoted to the teachings of Leo Strauss. In Curtis's world, it is Strauss, not Osama bin Laden, who is the real evil genius.""  
obvious again that, by his own admission CLIVE DAVIS NEVER EVEN SAW THE FIRST EPISODE, LET ALONE THE ENTIRE MOVIE.
had mr davis watched the film he would have noticed that curtis NEVER compares bin laden and strauss except for the philosophical root of the inspiration of their respective political movements.  leo strauss never promoted violence or killing in his teachings and curtis NEVER even hints that he did.
however one would have to be wildly ignorant to ignore that the idea of a secular free society being the greatest enemy to political control was prominently featured in the writings of strauss and qutb.  
and as far as historical inaccuracies, ive yet to find any... please point some out for the class hmmm?  as far as encarta, world book, and the wiki are concerned, mr curtis' accounts of egypt, afghanistan and iraq are dead on...what exactly did curtis lie about?
or are you referring to mr davis' feeling about how so called 'team b' was slighted in the film... ?
do some reading on team b.... the entirety of the intelligence community was against their findings... much like bush 2 before the iraq invasion... every one who didnt play ball was silenced or shown the door.

This is the best documentary ever made.
will seed forever"
,bazquux,2011-08-30T20:36Z,"""Letter to Adam Curtis on The Power of Nightmares"" by John Hilley:

I think the claims of the series, and your arguments in defence, are flawed in two main senses:

1. A failure to contextualise the real structural forces underlying the current climate of fear.

2. A mistaken reading of how ideas are used in that process.

Taken together, The Power of Nightmares avoided the much more important issue of neoliberalism and the critical role of ideas in maintaining corporate power.

As a way of connecting these points, let me quote from Susan Georgeâ€™s excellent A Short Essay on Neoliberalism (at www.globalpolicy.org/globaliz/econ/histneol.htm). Besides a helpful prÃ©cis of that projectâ€™s antecedents, she has this to say about its quite brilliant use of ideas:

â€œâ€¦the neo-liberals and their funders have created a huge international network of foundations, institutes, research centers, publications, scholars, writers and public relations hacks to develop, package and push their ideas and doctrine...â€

This is the process, conceptualised by Gramsci, as cultural hegemony. And it is the hegemony of corporate ideas which, as George notes, has become the axiom upon which both the life of politics and the politics of life is now being presented:

â€œâ€¦the great new central question of politics is, in my view, â€˜Who has a right to live and who does notâ€™. Radical exclusion is now the order of the day, I mean this deadly seriously...Anyone can be ejected from the system at any time â€” because of illness, age, pregnancy, perceived failure, or simply because economic circumstances and the relentless transfer of wealth from top to bottom demand it...Under the principles of competition and maximising shareholder value, such behaviour is seen not as criminally unjust but as normal and indeed virtuous.â€

As George suggests, the power of hegemonic ideas lies in understanding how such ideals and values become part of the consensual â€˜realityâ€™ favoured by corporate forces.

And here we can note, as part of that process, the role of the political class. You discuss their relevance in your response, yet it received no real consideration in the series. Of the nature of the political classâ€™s motives, you write:

â€œI think they have turned to fear not because of a real enemy outside but because they feel their own sense of legitimacy and authority dwindling.â€ Here, â€œpoliticians have found in fear a way of restoring their power and authority and recreating a sense of legitimacy.â€ This is â€œthe last gasp of a liberal political elite to maintain their sense of specialness in society.â€

You claim, in effect, that the political class are somehow projecting the present climate of fear as some rearguard attempt to reclaim lost authority. Yet, this fails to see the interdependency of the political-corporate relationship itself. The political class and corporate elite may have differing roles and varying takes on the world. But they both interact within the same terms of reference. That interaction may not always be smooth. But its defining framework is the politics of assisting business.

,bazquux,2011-08-30T20:38Z,"John Hilley continued:

Take just a few examples: the US governmentâ€™s lobbying of US corporate interests through the WTO (raising â€˜trade blocâ€™ tensions between the US and EU political classes), the Foreign Officeâ€™s almost singular role in advancing UK business interests abroad and the shared agenda of the Department for International Development and the IMF/World Bank over neoliberal trade, privatisation and aid conditionalities.

One may also note here how key aid NGOs have become caught up in this same market-based agenda. Indeed, the new director of the World Development Movement, Mark Curtis, (author of Web of Deceit), has recently criticised this cosy interaction, arguing that their incorporation is merely deepening the problems of third-world development.

But the political class are also responding to the structural crises created by corporate capitalism. Again, the â€˜solutionsâ€™ are private-sector-led. Consider, for example, David Blunkettâ€™s heavy-sentence and prison-privatisation agenda, a process influenced by corporations like Group 4 through organised political lobbying. As in Belmarsh, the push for greater deregulation and more punitive social policies also ties in with the purge on economic migrants and asylum seekers. Similar brutality is evident in the privatised Woomera detention camp, Australia. And, of course, corporate control over the US penal sector is closely linked to the political consensus on Capitol Hill for tough sentencing.

You may argue that elucidation of these issues would merit another and, no doubt, different series. But the nature of political-corporate relations is intrinsic to the issues raised. Three decades of neoliberalism have been brought about not just by corporate imposition on political life. It has survived and developed through shared understandings and mediated assumptions about market life and the supposed â€˜lack of alternativesâ€™ to that worldview. That set of values, projected as corporate philosophy, absorbed through political-business networks and filtered as social norms, has become the working reality of editors and journalists as much as finance ministers and home secretaries.

What draws all these things together is the deepening global crisis being created by corporate power. While this series made concerted efforts to trace the origins of the neo-conservative and Al Qaeda movements, it was silent on this much more significant force; indeed, the most momentous economic, political and ideological project the world has ever seen.

There is a vital historical narrative here. How could any meaningful essay on the period have failed to mention the doctrines of Milton Friedman and the Chicago Boys, the emergence of monetarism from the mid-1970s, its endorsement by Congress and other key political structures, its political application as Reaganism and Thatcherism, its continuation under Clinton and Blair? Did all this mean nothing in this great conflict of ideas suggested by the film? While the tracing of the neo-con lineage was interesting, it never connected into the central story of corporate power.

This is where your take on the neo-cons should really have begun: in describing how this circle came to impose itself on the neoliberal project. The neo-con agenda was, as we know, being pushed and promoted throughout the Clintonian phase of neoliberalism. It was advanced intellectually via the Project for a New American Century and other ideological networks. The ideas factory for it was the re-stated politics of American exceptionalism, increased military spending and, in its most visionary form, â€˜full spectrum dominanceâ€™.

This was not incompatible, as such, with neoliberal aims. What the neo-cons wanted was to graft on to that a more intensive form of militarist corporatism. Cheney, Rumsfeld, Wolfowitz, Bolton, Perle et al may have, as your thesis suggests, been driven by the ideology of â€˜America firstâ€™, using the myths of conservative evangelism to bolster its case. But this was always, and still remains, an ideology embedded into US corporate"
,bazquux,2011-08-30T20:42Z,"John Hilley continued:

The absence of corporate militarism as contextual narrative also hides the true nature of the present disasters in Iraq and Afghanistan. These are not only gross violations of humanity in pursuit of geopolitical and economic ends. Neither is it just about the big political-corporate headliners like Bechtel and Halliburton. Think also of the multiple contracts awarded to those corporations providing military services, such as CACI International and the US-based Titan Corporation, the â€˜interrogation specialistsâ€™ who trained the prison personnel in resistance and torture techniques at Abu Ghraib. This is the most privatised war in history.

And the real story behind it is the rise of neoliberal militarism. One of the great paradoxes of the neoliberal project, with its calls for a hand-off state, is that the stateâ€™s role has massively intensified: in acting as corporate guardian, in promoting market-friendly legislation, in encouraging capital movement, in writing the â€˜diplomaticâ€™ language for war, and, as a consequence of all this, in having to manage the massive global fallout: genocide, Islamic resentment, global poverty, human displacement and social exclusion.

In other words, the climate of fear suggested in the series can be more realistically traced to corporate fundamentalism, not Islamic, or, even on its own, neo-conservative fundamentalism. And, as those forces provoke more war and corporate expansion, the political class, in willing or pragmatic response, have assumed a new policing role, using the moment to expand punitive measures, privatise prisons, purge asylum seekers and impose a new surveillance regime.

That fearmongering even extends into erstwhile friendly places like the BBC. Such institutions function best as hegemonic agencies where safe liberal-capitalist conditions prevail. However, the new neoliberal climate and turn to militarism has disrupted that equilibrium, pushing some elements into would-be â€˜fourth-estate modeâ€™ â€” as in the Gilligan case. Consistent with the BBCâ€™s otherwise apologetic coverage of Iraq, that awkwardness has since been quietly managed by the new directorship. Yet, Blairâ€™s purge of Dyke and Davies shows that even quiescent parts of the establishment are now under threat.

I think The Power of Nightmares did throw up some interesting questions, notably on the use and abuse of fear, and with it the pretext for greater state surveillance. But, it has painted a highly distorted picture of how that has come about.

And the praise received says a lot about the type of inbuilt assumptions I have noted. In effect, this series appealed to the liberal zeitgeist because it reflects a general concern that the state is manipulating us through contrived fears: the so-called â€˜terrorist threatâ€™. But the deeper reality it suppresses is the sense in which that media itself is conditioned, like the rest of society, to think of corporate life as a somehow a priori or neutral part of that process, rather than the main reason for global crisis and the climate of fear.

This, perhaps, explains the attention to selective forces in the series itself. For selective attention is part of the wider system of subconscious propaganda. This is the real power of dominant ideas."
