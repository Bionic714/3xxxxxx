RELEASE NOTES 

; Well, since there was no one releasing this shit and I couldn't keep; waiting to play this game with my friends, I decided to do this 
; myself. I'm not much of a programmer, so it's not perfect, but it 
; works for private servers. If you can do it better, then do so :p 
; Note that this patch will not list your game in the public lists 
; (Why? Cause it's a PRiVATE server patch, duh ;)) 

INSTALL NOTES 

1) Extract the contents of ind-cod2psp.zip to your CoD2 folder 
; 2) In your CoD2 dir, use patch.exe to replace CoD2MP_s.exe with the 
; one I modified 
; 3) Fire up CoD2 and start a server. Your friends can now connect 
; directly to your IP to join the game without having their CDKey 
; checked by Activision 
; 4) If you want everything back to normal, use unpatch.exe, the 
; original CoD2MP_s.exe will then be put back in place 
; 
; THANKS GO TO 

DEViANCE for their release of CoD2 which made me able to bring you 
; this patch. Good to have you back DEViANCE, you're doing fine work 
; once again ! =).
