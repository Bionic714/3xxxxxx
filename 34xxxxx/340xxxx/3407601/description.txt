Phoenix Simulation Software's Boeing 777 Professional 2004 Multipack Installer

Includes 3 Aircraft Models with Boeing RollOut Liveries .

Ariac Cycle 511 with complete SID/STAR Database is embedded to the aircraft Navdata .

I made this installer from PopArts RIPPED Release for easy installation . ( Sounds funny but they rip I re-pack 'cause some of our virtual pilots are not good at pc usage and they mess up with zipped packs )

Anyway , Installer is able to dedect your Fs9 Folder has uninstall capability - who needs - and olsa installs the nessecary fonts to your Windows Xp font library .

Simply an "install and fly" release .

Thansk to PopArt and all involved friends for the Ripped Release .

This package has been tested and verified by my and 27 Virtual Pilots . All reported %100 satisfaction ;)

Happy Simming
