,airman123,2008-01-18T11:52Z,"If you have downloaded this torrent, then you have helped put PSS out of buissness. That means they will make no more addons. For proof, go to ""http://www.phoenix-simulation.co.uk"" and see for your self. I hope your happy!"
,bogey4brian,2008-06-03T20:19Z,"Yes airman 123, this torrent is the reason why PSS has closed its doors. Not because of there low-quality, overpriced aircraft with poor systems integration. PSS has always been the laughing stock of the FS community, and will continue to be if they re-open for business."
