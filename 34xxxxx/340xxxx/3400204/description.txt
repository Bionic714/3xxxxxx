The classic computer game that elecrtified a generation finally hits the big screen. Something has gone wrong at a remote scientific research station on Mars. All research has ceased. Communication has failed. And the messages that do get through are less than comforting. It?s a level 5 quarantine and the only souls allowed in or out are the Rapid Response Tactical Squad -- hardened marines armed to the teeth with enough firepower to neutralize any enemy? or so they think. The research being done at Olduvai station has unwittingly opened a door and all hell has broken loose. A legion of nightmarish creatures of unknown origin lurk behind every wall and stalk the countless rooms and tunnels of the facility, killing what few people remain. Sealing off the portal to Earth, Sarge (Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson), Reaper (Karl Urban) and their team must use every weapon at their disposal -- and some they find along the way -- to carry out their orders: nothing gets out alive.
