			Quick Plot Summary: 

Disturbing manga inspired by an even more disturbing movie of the same
name. As you might expect, they both deal with the theme of suicide. 
However, the plots of the manga and movie are significantly different,
so don't wory about spoilers and such. The manga isn't for the faint of
heart, and the movie even more so.
