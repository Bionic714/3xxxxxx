Well I kept waiting for someone to up this episode but it never happened. So I found it somewhere else and thought I would help out all that are waiting. This has been a great series and there better be a second season or FX may face a boycott. This is not a LOKI rip but it's just about as good. Hope everyone enjoys this because it is going to be a long wait until next season.
