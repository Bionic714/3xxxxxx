,jimmyboner,2008-03-16T02:32Z,"Ok i got it working pretty quickly on Windows 2000.  

1. Download Power ISO and Deamon Tools
2. Unrar the files
3. Convert the unrared files into an iso file with Power ISO. 
4. Mount the iso using Deamon tools
5. Install and bobs your uncle. 

Thanks uploader for the files but maybe consider giving some instructions on how to get this working next time. "
