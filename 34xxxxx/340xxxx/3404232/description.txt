In the city of Bronston, staying alive is a twenty-four hour job.  A savage bunch of holligan kids who call themselves the Red Skulls have been the dominant street gang in the city for years.

Uri decides to get out of Bronston before he shares his friend's same fate.  the only problem is the rest of the gang doesn't plan on letting him out so easy.  the new self-appointed leader, Lester, has set a trap to luire Uri back, but without Uri in charge, all is not well within the gang's ranks.  A traitorus member has set a trap of his own for Lester, and the rest of the Red Skulls are about to become the victims.
