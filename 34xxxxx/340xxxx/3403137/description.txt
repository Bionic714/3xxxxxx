This is, I think, a concert which it is konwn to be difficult to get a copy of, because Patti Smith has never allowed it to be reshown afterwards. So the quality is not perfect, because it is recorded directly from tv, and in 1979 videorecorders was not that good. But it is possible to see what is going on and the sound is acceptabel. But don´t expect high quality and don´t give me any complaints about it. Anyway, I´ve seen a lot of requests on this one and therefore I release it. Some hardcore Smithfans surely like to grab it. The format is Divx.
