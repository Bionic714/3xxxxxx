A good old classic

Just mount the "worms.img" with Daemon tools and don't have any cd/dvd in any of your regular cd/dvd reader if you don't want an messagebox saying "Please insert the original CD-ROM in drive" when you try to start the game.

The game works to play over LAN and off course in singelplayer mode. If you want to play over Internet you can use Hamachi (http://www.hamachi.cc).
