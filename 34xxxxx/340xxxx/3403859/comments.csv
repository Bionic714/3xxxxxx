,hastalavistababy,2006-02-09T15:49Z,USA maps: I couldÂ´nt get USA maps to work after I installed newest tomtom version. After reinstall of 5.0 they worked fine. The bluetooth uodate stayed installed (and works). Try it!
,a2000rick,2006-04-20T20:21Z,"Is there any updated crack out there so that we can upgrade this to 5.2 or at least 5.1? 
The memory leaks for x50v make it impossible to use. HELP!"
,n11xxy,2006-05-14T23:30Z,"i think i have cracked version of tomtom 5, but in the crack_palm folder there is just text document referring to the munich.bin file but no brack file for me to copy. can i download the cracked file?"

Thanks"
,a2000rick,2006-05-26T18:50Z,The cracks used for TOMTOM 5.1-5.21 do not work with north american maps. I hope someone makes one that does soon. Try TOMTOM 5.0 although on the x50v there is a memory leak that will only allow you to use it for about an hour before it crashes. :(

,subarus,2006-09-06T20:43Z,"The instruction is not complete: This is what you need to do:

find Benelux.cab and uncompress it. 
using external expansion card reader, copy the BENELUX/ directory to root
rename BENELUX to BENELUX-map
copy munich.bin from crack to card
launch tomtom. and select benelux map and follow the instructions until procedure completes

the original instructions missed the details on installing benelux map.

thanks for seeding"
,awc825,2006-09-09T08:22Z,"I followed subarus's advice and installed the benelux map to the memory card. When I start TomTom Navigator on Palm Zire 72s, there's only a white screen with message ""Armcode not allocated!"" flashing. What am I doing wrong? I don't see any TomTom folder installed on the memory card either."
