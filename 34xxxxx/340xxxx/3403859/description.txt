TomTom Nav 5 + Palm crack + USA & Canada Maps

Instructions:

- Unrar "TomTom5.rar", burn contents to disk, and run Setup.exe.

- Follow on screen instructions & install TTN5 (With the expansion card inside the Palm device!).

- Also install the map Benelux from this setup too. After TomTom has run once, you can delete this map through the application in the "Map Manager" menu.

-After installing the application and a map, rename Munich.bin (located on your SD card in the "TomTom" directory) into Munich.bin.old and copy the Munich.bin-file from the "crack" directory into "TomTom".

-Delete the "START.PRC" file on your expansion card in the /PALM/ directory if you DO NOT want TTN5 to start automatically whenever the card is inserted.

- Copy Maps of your choice to the root of your storage card; they'll show up in TomTom's Change map option.

Feel free to download and install the Palm TTN5 patch from TomTom.com. It fixes many bugs found in the previous release.
