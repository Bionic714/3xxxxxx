Coldplay live in stockholm 2005.
The videos are taken with my normal digital camera so the fotage gets out off focus from time to time.
The sound is crystal clear.
The pictures are magnifisant.

Sorry for the shake in the camera, i wass probebly in ecstasy during the whole consert.


any way, thank you coldplay for a unforgetable night! keep rockin on.
I am totaly buying your albums.
