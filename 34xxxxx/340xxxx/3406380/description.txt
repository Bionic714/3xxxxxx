AlamDV is a very old and underpowered program and we no longer sell or support it. If you still need access to the AlamDV installers or the plugins, follow the links below.

Our new program, EffectsLab DV (known as 'AlamDV3' during development), is now in charge and you should definately check out its amazing features:

? Create Hollywood-style visual effects in your own home.

? Manipulate your own astounding particle effects at the click of a button.
? Draw amazing freehand lightsword animations, unlike anything seen before.

? Standalone, dedicated product - no need to buy additional plugins or programs.

? Generate unique, realistic muzzle flashes to enliven any shoot-out or action sequence.

? Supports MiniDV, DirectShow AVI and Quicktime MOV.

? Works alongside your favourite tools, including Final Cut Pro, iMovie and Premiere Pro.

? Nothing else comes close to the power and affordability of EffectsLab.
