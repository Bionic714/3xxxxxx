Star Trek The Next Generation Season 7 Episodes 1-24 for Ipod Video

No iPod video would be complete without Star Trek episodes on it!

I urge you to go through your movie/TV collection and rip at least a few of them over to Mp4 format and upload them. Do everyone a favor and help the conversion process so we all have something decent to watch on our video ipods.  It only takes a few hours to convert a ton of videos.

A quick Google Search for "3GP_Converter" will hook you up (Windows Users)with a very easy method for converting your current AVI's. (Mac users can grab a copy of Quicktime Pro).

These episodes were encoded to MP4 format with the following settings:

QVGA/29.97fps/768kbps Stereo/128kbps

Hope to see more torrents uploaded by the community soon.
