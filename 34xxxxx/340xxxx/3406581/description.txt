Shot on location, the video takes you into the center of some New Age activities and the documentary itself examines many New Age ideas from holisitc health, yoga, hypnosis and trancendental meditation to New Age education practices, global government and the human potential movment. The evidence presented is sure to convince even skeptics that a New Age movement has solid footing in every aspect of American society and is gaining momentum at incredible speed.
