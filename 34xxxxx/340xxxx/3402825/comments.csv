,kukenifitta,2006-08-10T09:43Z,ANYBODY feeling like seeding for a while??
,kukenifitta,2006-08-10T09:44Z,It is never too late to seed....famous words....
,kukenifitta,2006-08-11T15:42Z,Any chance of seeding this marvelous series again????
,M0b1u5,2006-08-13T23:46Z,PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE SEED!
,kukenifitta,2006-08-16T16:40Z,I donÂ´t think this will work.....:-(
,M0b1u5,2006-08-20T22:26Z,"ACK. 

8.9% for a week :("
,tio00,2006-09-03T10:21Z,"Please, can someone seed this, and get it going again? THX! I' m stuck at 8.9% also"
,M0b1u5,2006-09-19T05:19Z,"Now stuck at 24.5% - why the fuck do people leave a torrent before anyone gets to 100%? Sweet Baby Jebus, I'll seed this for months if someone lets me get the whole damn series!"
,tequila68,2007-03-12T20:29Z,Another torrent of series 3 has just been started on Demonoid. I got the other 2 seasons there last week.
,M0b1u5,2007-03-19T02:48Z,"WAAAH! I'm STILL trying to get this series. The Demonoid site isn;t taking new registrations! ACK. Why does PB show 1 seeder when there are zero?? Damn Frustrating, I must say."
,berrys66,2007-11-10T23:08Z,"No seeders?

Downloaded only 16k in the last 2 weeks :( Please seed if you have this ...."
