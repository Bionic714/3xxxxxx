Guitarz has all the building blocks for beginning to accomplished guitarists. Guitarz includes these modules: Chords, Chord Design, Scales, Song Page (Play Page), and Tab Play Page. The Tab Play Page allows anyone to download thousands of ASCII guitar tab files from the Internet and play them on the guitar neck graphic, which shows the exact fingering for any of the songs.
