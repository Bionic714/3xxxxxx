This is a repack of the vob-file out there. It has been done with ReJig (demux) and reauthored with IfoEdit. The result is a videofile of 5,2GB and three soundtracks, all english. I have stripped the DD2.0 and the dts5.1 and kept only the DD5.1. The resulting reauthored movie is compressed with DVDShrink 25% (after a Deep Analysis)... and nooo, I have'nt used CCE because I can't handle it and the Intervideo results in block noise (=LEGO, probably due to the origin)... OK

Video     :   NTSC, compressed 25% with DVDShrink
Audio     :   English DD5.1
Subs      :   none
Extra     :   nope
Menu      :   uhuh
FBI-warnings, Walt Disney trailers etc.: zero

Don't bitch me about seeding, DVDShrink, lack of subs

The quality is the ordinary old fashioned NTSC with grainy low light scenes, but since the movie is a slow one the compression is hardly noticable unless you are a bit dorky like me. It's a goos movie... if you like it, buy it (and upload the PAL-version ;-)
