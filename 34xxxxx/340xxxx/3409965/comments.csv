,Nachtworst,2006-02-25T22:33Z,ROFL!! :-D
,zellen,2006-03-29T18:04Z,serial number?
,Yobo1987,2006-10-31T13:08Z,I just think he forgot to write english down. It would be stupid to not have the most common world language in the new translutator. And it will probebly transelate from english to all of the above. Otherwise it wouldent be called a translator. All languages above can be transelated from and to all languages above!!!

,Zoned87,2008-09-12T10:52Z,"This program is a mixed blessing, some languages work extremely well like English/Spanish, English/German, English/ French.

But others work very very poorly...

Like English/Thai, English/Arabic, English/Vietnamese

English/Chinese and English/Japanese arent horrible, but not really that great either... just kinda so so. 

Its a 50/50 deal... on the bright side it supports more languages that any other translators out there, on the down side only about half of them can translate with any accuracy."
