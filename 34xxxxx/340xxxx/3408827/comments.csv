,ThyFrozenSun,2011-04-10T23:39Z,"The quality is awesome, but I don't know if there's anything wrong about the video format, because when I try to go to Properties to see the audio and video details, it says ''Summary properties are unavailable for the selected source(s).'', so I guess it's not XVID.
Anyways, thanks for uploading these movies! I downloaded them in about 2 hours, even though there aren't many seeds!"
