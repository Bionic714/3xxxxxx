Have dreams of a better world become obsolete?

u4Ya.ca: A Book for a Better World pursues the quest for plausible and feasible options for self-improvement and world-improvement.  Stimulating and provocative, u4Ya.ca is designed to bring real hope for a brighter future.

One highlight is The Capital Cap, which is a proposal for a mixed economic system that combines the best of both capitalism and socialism in order to redistribute wealth and power to ensure a more sustainable economy.

Another highlight, The Peace Path, is one relatively quick and simple process that starts with an individual and goes on to achieve peace on a global scale.

u4Ya.ca: A Book for a Better World is independently produced and is released under the Creative Commons license, meaning it is free and legal to share with everyone.  So, if you like what you read, please help to seed.
