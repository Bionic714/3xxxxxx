Minimalist anonymous mailer, use to scare the heck out of people (read:noobs)

Or use simply as a much faster replacement for your hotmail or similar.

Gots:
3 buttons: send, about, exit
Does it's own MX query (for the domain in the To: field.)
That's it.

Bads:
Sometimes gets flagged as spam
Requires Visual Basic runtimes (other OCXs already included.)
You need to keep the serial around every time you run it
No attachments :-(

It's pretty small, so even if you don't need it but support the cause, seed it.
The password is a single space, the same space as the filename of the included nfo.
