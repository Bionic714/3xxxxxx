Thanks alot man, I have been hunting high and low a working copy.  I used the latest version of DOSBOX (v 0.72).  Thanks again man!  I will totally seed the hell outta this!"
,spopt36,2008-07-15T15:26Z,"works great, but is there a way to install the game? the only EXE i found for installing, installs an old version of adobe acrobat.
or is there another way to get the game to save and load  saved games?"
,spopt36,2008-07-15T15:56Z,"nevermind, i didnt read the instructions."
,Rosmo666,2008-08-02T16:35Z,This truely is the best game ever! Thanks!
,iMiKED,2009-01-05T07:46Z,"I have a question - Is there on original SYNDICATE (not wars) disc CDAUDIO? Or SYNDICATE original disc never contains a CDAUDIO? 

If SYNDICATE contains CDAUDIO, there is no CDAUDIO in this torrent, ISO file dont support CDAUDIO savings."
,GrinningGhoul,2009-01-22T14:06Z,"Thanks for the upload, but what do I have to do to get the game save and load?"
,GrinningGhoul,2009-01-23T12:50Z,Got it working now... had to create SYND/SAVE in the game folder and mount hard drive separately (I was using D.O.G.)
,Ongen,2009-01-27T13:27Z,"How come i cant save games ?
I tryed creating SAVE folder in syndicate folder but didnt work..."
,GrinningGhoul,2009-01-28T19:33Z,"Just type mount c c:\ like in the description. If you have Syndicate in other drive, mount that after mounting C:\.

Example: I installed Syndicate on D:\
mount c c:\
mount d d:\
d:
cd syndicate
cd datadisk (if you wan't American Revolution)
main

I don't know if it needs the SAVE folder... I just saw that kind of advise somewhere. And you have to mount every time you play, or the save games won't show."
,mutig,2009-03-19T20:52Z,"So after spending way too long being confused about how to save, I figured it out. I didn't quite know what you meant, grinning, but thankfully between your post about creating the folders and the error dosbox was giving me upon saving, I realized what to do.

the error I got was ""Warning: file creation failed: c:\SYND\SAVE\00.GAM"" so instead of creating those folders inside my game folder (c:\syndicate) i made them in the C folder. and just so there's no confusion, I mean create a folder called ""SYND,"" then create a folder called ""SAVE"" within that SYND folder.

Hopefully that clears all the confusion and no one will have to waste their time feeling foolish like I did.

Now to get my ass kicked by this game like the old days =)"
,GrinningGhoul,2009-04-03T06:36Z,"Yes, the SYND\SAVE does nothing in the game folder, but that was an advice I saw somewhere.

The SYND\SAVE needs to be in C:\, but in my case those folders were created automatically (also SAVE2), as I later noticed.

My only problem was that I wanted the game on hard-drive D:\ instead of C:\. Maybe the using of D.O.G. mixed things up also.

Didn't mean to confuse anyone or waste their time.

I'm not a computer wizard, just wanted to play the damn game..."
,mrJME99,2009-07-08T03:13Z,"The game works great but I am still having trouble getting syndicate to save. This is what I did.

-Create folder ""SYND"" in C: drive
-Create folder ""SAVE"" in ""SYND"" folder

1. When I save the game how do I make the saved game go into this folder? 
2. Is there anything else I need to add to those two folders in order to save games? 
3. What does D.O.G mean? Saw a lot of people write about ""using"" it.

Any info would be great!
"
,mrJME99,2009-07-08T06:05Z,"I figured it out.

in ""C:SYNDICATE"" folder I made a folder called ""SYND"" then inside that folder one called ""SAVE"".

- c:syndicate\synd\save

That worked just fine for me. Was a little confused reading other posts.

I LOVE THIS GAME!"
,DragonBice,2010-06-15T19:35Z,"I only get the very small (I guess high resolution?) window when I run the game and of course, I can't just resize or fullscreen it like a windows window. Anyone got any ideas?"
,grc071,2011-01-30T11:32Z,"DragonBice - hav u tried hitting [ALT] +  ... when the game is playing? to get it full screen?
