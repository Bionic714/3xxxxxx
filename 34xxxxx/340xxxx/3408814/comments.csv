,pjsmoke,2011-07-03T16:04Z,"Pixelation galore based on a preview of the first season, however this rip is in every torrent across the web. Shit, I'll just wait a couple of years until a good dvdrip is released.

Avoid if you want an actually good rip and not a rip based on speed rather than quality."
