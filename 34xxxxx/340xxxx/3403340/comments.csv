,jes3232,2006-11-03T20:39Z,"If you download ""vlc-player"" (google it!) you'll be able 2 drag and drop the containing folder into the player and you'll get full movie with subtitles and language selections!

VLC-player is unarguably the best media-player i've ever tried. It's freeware, small and it opens ALL movies!"
