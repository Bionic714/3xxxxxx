Synopsis:

Samo Hung plays Courageous Cheung, a cuckolded husband who faces a series of supernatural challenges from his wife's wealthy lover. First, Cheung must survive a night in a house haunted by a bloodthirsty vampire. From there, things just get worse--Hopping corpses, supernatural possession by a monkey god, the gratuitous sacrifice of a chicken, and lots of chanting by Taoist priests will all seem pretty trippy. Encounters of the Spooky Kind kick-started a whole new genre back in 1980 when Samo Hung unleashed this Directorial effort on the Asian market to universal acclaim and great success. Combining low budget, but highly effective special effects to create vampires many a western audience will have never seen before. Samo weaves a charming story around a horror setting, adding his innovative style of Martial Arts choreography and of course took his own unique brand of comedy to the fore and created what is still today a thoroughly enjoyable Horror Martial Arts Comedy!

Overall 5 Star Rating, must see.
