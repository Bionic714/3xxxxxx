IGFly's Tupolev Tu-154M version 1.2 (rip)

I took a quick peek at this package and there are two things that need your attention:
1) in the aircraft.cfg change [fltsim.4] in [fltsim.0] for the aircraft to show up.
2) once loaded in FS2004 you'll get a panel configuration error...just click on the x and it will go away.

The gauges seem to work well, although I never took of in this Russian coffin.
Please report any problems.
