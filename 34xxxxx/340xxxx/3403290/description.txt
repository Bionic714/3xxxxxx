Depthcharge - Deep Water Soloing 

 Depthcharge is an epic deep water soloing film following a dream team of sixteen climbers (Chris Sharma, Leo Houlding, Steve McClure, Tim Emmett, Adrian Baxter, and others) as they explore and develop unclimbed Croatian cliffs. The film includes footage of 8b and 8b+ routes being climbed ground-up, the hardest deep water solos ever!
