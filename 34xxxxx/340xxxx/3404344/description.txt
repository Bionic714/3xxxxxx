My little present to the Pro Evolution Community.

This a 100% retail version of Pro Evolution Soccer 5 with K_Patch included.

Details of patch:
This has been floating around on Evo_Web for a little while now and it seems no one really knows where is has come from.

platform - XBOX
GAME - PES5
Version - K_patch 0.5

8 new balls - nike/adidas
New Boots - nike/adidas/mizno/puma..
Higgs real emblem
5 set new rotating adboards
Maximo chants
Diehloids call patch
new background music

Biggest thing at the moment is getting real kits into the Xbox version, people have already patched the PS2 version and the creator of Games Graphics Studio is working on Xbox and PC encyption.

I noticed that no one yet has uploaded the retail version of PES5 so I thought I would with a patch already included.

I will be keeping my ear to the ground about inserting kits and posting the tools to do so on my forum.
