Network Tips:
----------------------
This Program is Intended to Work on TCP/IP LAN Networks ...
the Program Uses the UDP Protocol In it's Communications...
In order to Operate Correctly You and Your Chatters Must be on the Same
Network; in other words if your IP is 10.11.12.13 then the Other chatters
Must be on the same Network which Starts with 10.11.12.XXX where XXX is a
Unique Number for Each PC ... in this case that all the PC's are running
the Program and ARE on the SAME NETWORK ; they will be Able to chat without
any Problems.
Another Tip for FireWalled Users :) ...
The Program Uses the Following Port 34232 
BE SURE this Port is Open and Not Blocked by the FireWall or Else you will
not be able to chat at all !!.
