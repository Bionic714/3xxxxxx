THANKS. Looking back on the last ten years it's mostly people I remember, not the places or the concerts. My invaluable band and friends remember those things for me, since I have a terrible memory for those things. Except for one day in 1994. I was at home in my apartment in Huddinge outside Stockholm, when I got a call from Sony Music. They asked me to come and see them, and when I got there I was asked to play all my songs to two very good-looking guys. I got a record deal. It's hard to describe that feeling, but since that day people, who I have a reason to thank, have come and gone almost every day. And some of them have stayed. I miss many of you more than you know, and I sometimes wish I'd have done more to keep in touch. I want to thank all of you for everything that has been, everything that is now, and everything that hopefully will come. You make my days, S.
