,Vadim Makarov,2009-08-05T04:52Z,"This is training for OBSOLETE, NO LONGER ADMINISTERED TEST VERSION. This CD-rom is training for ""Computer-based test"" (CBT). It is no longer administered and has been completely replaced by ""Internet-based test"" (iBT) since 2006. There are substantial differences between the contents of these two test formats. If you are looking for TOEFL training CD, this is a WRONG ONE. (25 seeders are losers :)."
,Vadim Makarov,2009-08-05T07:26Z,"This torrent has at least one functional test CD for the current iBT test: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3714997/TOEFL_iBT_Prep_Material

(I've checked that Barron 1 CD works fine, you can download just that file selectively if your torrent client allows.)

Too bad I've wasted a couple hours on the CBT from the present torrent until I've realized it's a wrong old test."
