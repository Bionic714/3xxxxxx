Description: This is Nagisa Oshima's controversial film about the destructive relationship between wealthy businessman Kizicho and his ex-prostitute servant Sada Abe. After making love they enter a climactic sexual relationship that obsesses them and leads them to ever new extremes. Because of its exlicit depictions of sexual acts and overt nudity this film was heavily censored in Japan and has been condemned as covert pornography by many critics. Despite all that, In the Realm of the Senses remains an original, subversive and thought-provoking work of art.
