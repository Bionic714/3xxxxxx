,Slipknot51,2006-03-06T09:43Z,"I downloaded it, unrared it, and mounted the ISO. Then nothing happened. What do I do?"
,jimmy_b,2006-03-07T03:06Z,well its for the xbox. so you can either extract the files from the iso and ftp them to your xbox or burn the image to dvd and use it like a reg. game.
,Slipknot51,2006-03-07T08:08Z,"I went to extract the files, and it looks empty. What program should I use to extract the files?"
,Sykokaj,2006-05-26T15:04Z,"I downloaded this, transferred to the xbox but cant start the game. I get to the menu, but as soon as I chose difficulty, and it starts to load - the xbox freezes up.

Any one have a solution?"
