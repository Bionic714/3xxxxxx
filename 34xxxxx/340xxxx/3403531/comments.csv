,zoltan_jeff,2006-12-31T00:38Z,"1- with Daemon Tools set number of virtual CD/DVD-ROM to ?1?

2- mount the image with Daemon Tools, all emulation options on

3- just run once Y.A.S.U to hide your virtual drive

4- run Hamachi and join or create a hamachi network

5- start the game, join or host a server over LAN"
,MatteMaster,2008-03-25T22:29Z,"Hi ""zoltan_jeff""
sorry to say that it doesnt work, it shuts down when you launch the  created game, has nothing to do with hamachi,   plz does anyone know anything about playing battlefront II  in LAN??  "
,realvibez,2008-04-12T22:36Z,try downloading a fixed exe crack from gamecopyworld that will get around the securom crap.
