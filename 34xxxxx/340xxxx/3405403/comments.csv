,suckbox554,2010-11-19T06:06Z,"This is training for Visual Studio C# 2005, and it is the MCAD training. The training consists of Application and Simulator Installation disk, CD315 - Web Applications, 316 1 and 2 for windows programming and 320 for Web Components. The lessons are text and video files inside of the TESTOUT navigator program, and the tests are inside the TESTOUT visual studio simulator. Apparently no one here is able to run the simulator, I haven't hit that spot yet, so I will comment on it if I can't or can get it to run.

NRG files can be ran using Daemon Tools LITE ---- Freeware version for personal use having no spyware or malware.


You can download daemon tools here --
