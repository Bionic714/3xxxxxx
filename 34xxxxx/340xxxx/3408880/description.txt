Sudeki (Xbox) 
A sultry wizardress, a soaring gunslinger, a powerful swordsman, a dark huntress. These four heroes are about to be hurtled over the edge into a flight filled with darkness. Sudeki, a roleplaying game designed by UK-based Climax features huge worlds, powerful heroes, and sexy heroines -- all wrapped up in Hong Kong-style cinematic combat. Set in a world ripped apart by deceit, the heroes of Sudeki journey down a twisting path of betrayal, gravity-defying combat, and unbelievable magic. The party's four characters can combine forces to form cooperative super strikes that can devastate legions of foes, of which there are more than 100 different types.
