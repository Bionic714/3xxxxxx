P L O T


When an unconfident young woman is cursed with an
old body by a spiteful witch, her only chance of
breaking the spell lies with a self-indulgent yet
insecure young wizard and his companions in his
legged, walking home.


rip notes:it's no need to let a 119-minute animation eat so many bitrates, so we
keep the two necessary audio tracks.

THESE ARE SCENE RELEASES, (I only download and upload them to share, if you want it) . which means these groups , in this case,MPT, somehow by some means gets a hold of a copy fo the film, then they do some encoding, and release them over the internet for everyone. So if this copy is not to your liking, move on and sorry to have wasted your time. Wait for the retail to buy or rent, or best yet some other nice folks who will be kind enough to upload and share with us, which I would appreicate very much.

There is a sample file inside here that you can check the quality.

you are welcome
