,snarmo,2006-01-06T00:52Z,Try writing on DVD-R instead of DVD+R
,bambuda,2006-01-24T04:32Z,"How to watch this in English? all the menu is in Japanese, and so far, no matter what i pick it is only in Japanese. Any clues here?"
,azureene,2006-01-29T02:23Z,"I used dvd shrink to burn on a dvd+r.  On the main menu, click on the top right topic.  This is to change the languages.  Pick the 2nd one down on the left for English.  "

,satmah,2006-02-01T01:03Z,"Hei, får melding om filen er korrupt. Bruker WinRar. Har også prøvd med WinZip, ingen ting skjer. Ser heller ingen logo av WinRar blandt disse filene. Er det noen som kunne si hva jeg bør gjøre? Takk!"
,satmah,2006-02-01T01:06Z,"Hei, bruker WinRar, men programmet sier filen er korrupt. Har også prøvd med WinZip uten noen resultater. Finner heller ingen ikon  av WinRar programmet blant disse filene. er det noen som kunne si hva jeg bør prøve? Takk!"

,Krutbult,2006-02-17T00:56Z,Varför kan jag inte använda WinRar? Why can't I use WinRar ?HELP!!
,comdot,2006-02-26T03:29Z,"notice that the menus are in JAPANESE, but if you jump around a little in the menus, you can get both english text and english subtitling... quality is average."
,Kippei,2006-02-27T14:11Z,How to burn? Should I just burn all the .rar files in to a dvd+r? Please help!!
,NirreFirre,2006-03-04T12:17Z,"I checked this up from http://www.dvdbeaver.com/film/DVDReviews20/howls_moving_castle_dvd_review.htm
and it't the korean, region 3, NTSC distribution with a black border around the whole picture (annoying and WHY?) the file is 720x540 but the MPEG stream 720x480. The quality could be better but I don't think the new releases are ripped yet..or? Thanks anyway for putting it up"
,NirreFirre,2006-03-04T12:27Z,"OPEN: mptdvd-hmc-dvdr.part001.rar, 
IF U HAVE DVD-R: Burn in DVD Decrypter (Google!), IF U HAVE DVD+R: Open in DVD Shrink and tick away a few subpicture languages to get a smaller ISO file to output (Backup), THEN burn in DVD Decrypter"

,Kippei,2006-03-26T13:31Z,"I used ""DVDShrink"" to make it fit on a DVD. The sound is hacking... :("
,Kippei,2006-03-26T17:41Z,...but it doesn't hack when open and looking at it in DVDShrink. Why does it just hack in the DVD-Player? :(
[V],robbie1412,2006-03-27T10:44Z,"suckitrebek. u fucking retarderd ibreed son of a bitch .. Nero is for burning mp3s and other shite , many dvd players wont play the movies , burned in Nero ... Dvd decrypter makes menu, and all u need , much easier to use also , so go fuck ure aunt u wanker !!"

Mitt enda problem är de japanska menyerna.
Men de stör mig inte mycket.
Tack så mycket.
Ingen som råkar veta filmens svenska release-datum, föresten?



This one was great!
My only problem is the japanese menus.
But it doesn't bother me much.
Many thanks!
By the way, does anyone knows the swedish release date for this movie?"

,Aegnor,2006-12-04T09:04Z,"So what are the audio tracks? Info states that there is Japanese and English, but are they Dolby Digital or DTS?

The Korean DVD-release has DTS-ES Matrix audio track, does this also have the DTS-ES?"

,agntsmyth,2008-01-12T00:02Z,If someone would be kind enough to write a step by step guide explaining how to change this from a rar file into something i can burn onto a dvd and play  in my dvd player on my tv I would really appreciate it. I use k3b on linux to burn dvds but im pretty sure  it has all the functionality of nero
,Tish87,2008-01-24T10:54Z,Wich player do you need to watch this movie??
,donpedro,2008-02-12T20:43Z,I can only find Japanese audio on this and chinese text. ??
,donpedro,2008-02-12T20:48Z,"My bad, looks good."
,ashikime,2008-03-08T20:57Z,"Ok, I found the best way to get it to play in English is to use the VLC player... you go to Audio then Track 2.

Also if you want to unrar the files I use unrarX which I've found to be fantastic btw... and you click on the first .rar in the file and unrarX unpacks them all right back into the file. You'll then find you have a new .img file at the top and ta-da! :D 
Hope that helps some people..."
,fallout11,2008-05-09T12:12Z,"Ashikime's has it right, VLC viewer, right click on the movie as it plays, pick ""audio track"", and select your choice.  Same can be done for subtitles.

Solid rip, nice film."
,Apamedvapen,2008-09-06T19:17Z,"What resolution is this one in?
I have been looking for Howl's moving castle in HD. I have one that's 720P, but it's in English but I want with japanese audio. That one is 2.4GB, this one seems only to be a normal DVD but it's 4.47GB."
,kirinlws,2009-03-01T21:34Z,to burn screw nero use convertxtodvd it is the best
,ozc,2009-06-20T01:05Z,Someone needs to post a bluray rip with eng dub included... Anything less than 720p does this film great injustice.
,ivansego,2010-05-16T05:45Z,"on the main screen, click the bottom right button to enter the subtitle menu, then the 3rd one down on the left to have English subtitles.. 

hope that helps, wish someone left that comment for me, i had to trial and error XD"
