 Rippers notes:

  There was about 1 minute of silence in
  "She Speaks To the Dead" becuase my brother 
  was playing a game (read: Counter-Strike) on 
  the connection - the game froze and jammed the
  modem... You will notice this when listening,
  I'm really sorry about it and hope that it
  won't bother you too much. Otherwise, this gig
  is just excellent and everyone should hear it!
  Evergrey rocks.
