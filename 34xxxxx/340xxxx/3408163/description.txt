Butch Walker, formerly of Marvelous 3, is one of the greatest singer/songwriters today in my opinion. Download this album and the album "Left Of Self-Centered" and judge for yourself. He has written and produced with for example: Avril Lavigne, SR71, Evan Taubenfeld, Tommy Lee, Niki Barr, Peter Searcy, Wakefield, Courtney Jaye, American
Hi-Fi, Simple Plan and more.
