So... the known file filter is missing in this torrent? I guess that isn't too bad considering it has been a few years since this version has been out and I am sure they have changed the hash sets quite a bit. Read up here: http://www.accessdata.com/media/en_us/print/techdocs/Forensic%20Toolkit.pdf (page 4) If you need instructions to import hash sets or creating a KFF library go here: http://www.accessdata.com/media/en_us/print/techdocs/techdoc.Importing%20or%20Adding%20Hash%20Sets%20to%20FTK.en_us.pdf These are direct links to AD's site.

If you need the hash sets, try Google. There are a ton of sites for them."
