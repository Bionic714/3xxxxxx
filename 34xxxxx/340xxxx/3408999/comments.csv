[T],fuckthesystem1,2008-10-21T02:48Z,"if your not to picky about quality, then this torrent is fine.. the album is at 128kbps and i can't stand it."
,Numskull808,2009-01-18T01:42Z,"well the 128 aac itunes quality won't make you puke but 128 kbps mp3 is FM radio quality and it sucks.  I wonder if most people even know they can adjust the settings when they rip something?   It only makes sense to do high quality if a person needs to shrink it, no problem .  But there is no way I can add quality to a file....."
,bingobingo,2009-06-29T14:16Z,If you're that bothered about the quality go out and buy the album. This person is doing you a favour.
,khajiit.,2010-03-10T21:55Z,anybody know where i can get that discography?
