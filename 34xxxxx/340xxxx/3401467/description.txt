The technology that is revolutionizing the world of DJ'ing.
Final Scratch? is the ideal playback unit for both the current state of the music industry and its future too. Not only does it give turntables access to the digital domain, but now producers, both professional and at home, can play their
own music without burning CD?s or making costly acetates. Final Scratch? finally balances the ongoing debate of CD?s versus turntable culture. Most interestingly and exciting about Final Scratch is that it is the perfect technology to allow people to play back music that is now being offered by the new wave of digital distributors both independent and major. Simply buy your music from the internet and play it back like you are used to... on a turntable.
Final Scratch is totally true to turntable and DJ culture. It doesn't ask you to throw away any thing. It just takes everything you have and adds a digital dimension to it.
And we are just scratching the surface...
