,nlkush,2006-01-31T19:22Z,"Awesome up man!! 

You made my year, I have the old 1.1.3 and need to get past it. Works great ;-)
I wonder if there is any interest in that version, hmmmm. I think i need to get it out and put it up. 
Thanks again!"
,Maelick,2006-02-27T11:04Z,The system ID is in the same window you enter the generated key into to register... Top off the page.....lol
,jonnyboy1981,2006-04-05T09:41Z,"I can't find the system ID at all??? Is it meant to be in the same window as the installation wizard??
Any help appreciated.
Many thanks for the software."

,cyberkotten,2007-08-06T12:37Z,tell me the system id
[T],maherie,2008-02-17T01:54Z,Read the fucknig NFO it's there for a fucking reason. losers.
,sti3,2008-06-21T22:52Z,I will seed this forever and ever.  It should be a freeware DL from Stanton or NI but they're assholes--no one who doesn't have the hardware would ever want this.
,elvis_clown,2008-08-20T19:21Z,"I guess the system ID has got something to do with the ""paradox.nfo"" file,,, :)"
,alexbdragon,2011-12-19T13:45Z,"hi, easier way if you have your origional serial no saved is to install and when asked for serial No, use your origional serial No, then contact NI who will issue the relevant code for unlocking..... NI are really helpful, Stanton are wankers. tried for a year to get a copy and NEVER got a reply, customer service is a bit like numark!!!!!!!"
