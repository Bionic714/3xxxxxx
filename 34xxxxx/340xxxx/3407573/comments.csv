If everyone knew how the world ticks, we would stop using this fictitious ink and paper substance only in circulation because of it's demand.  Stop demanding the most deceived scam in recorded history where there are finite resources on this small planet perpetually distroyed in land fills with apparently infinite population growth, are human beings really that FUCKING stupid?"
