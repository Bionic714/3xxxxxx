,pikeytheturtle,2006-03-28T01:51Z,The game works fine for me until the waterboat part where it stops and claims the disc is dirty or damaged.. does it work beyond that point for everyone else?
,fberto15,2006-04-09T00:15Z,is this NTSC and .iso??
,slayer410,2006-08-12T17:50Z,Yes this is NTSC and .iso and it works perfect on my Xbox! Just burn it to a disk and your ready to go.
,dajmtrollet,2007-07-05T18:16Z,Excelent job. Just roasted it on a DVD in low speed. Used DVD2XBOX to copy it to HD. Works like a charm.
