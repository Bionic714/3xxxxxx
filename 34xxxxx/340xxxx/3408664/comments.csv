Xpektro - for the file
happyboy - for the password"
,a8a999,2006-04-14T06:00Z,"This file works great!
1. Use WinRar to unzip
2. Use Alcohol 120% to burn
3. To play, if you see the screen scrolling, just press ""down"" button once, then press ""x"" once to select PAL60. You will see the screen stop scrolling. Then press ""x"" again to confirm.
4. Enjoy the game."

,Faitu,2009-11-29T15:57Z,"Thanks! My old Soul Calibur DVD was scratched and wasn't running well. I extracted this and burned with Blindwrite, works just fine. People should remember to use sc3ps2321587 as the password to extract the image file with winRAR. For some reason my old save file isn't working with this version, I won't mind going through all the work to unlock the characters and parts though, I kind of miss it to tell the truth. :P Once again, thank you!"

,inflikkt,2010-07-04T22:28Z,"seems to run on my pcsx2 with great framerate and all, but i get these black lines running down the screen.. whether i choose refresh rate at 50 or 60 doesnt seem to matter.  Also some of the graphics are splotched on peoples faces.  Any suggestions what graphics plugin works the best?  Anyone else try this out on pcsx2 ?  Aw well, at least it runs.."
,eaglrombie,2010-10-16T20:55Z,"NEED HELP WITH THE BLACK LINES?!?!? 

The solution (for me it worked anyways...) is to turn on NATIVE RESOLUTION, under your GSdx CONFIGURE settings... ^_^
Should look SOMETHING like this; 
Graphics: GSdx 2232 SSE41 0.1.15 (Directx 10) -- Resolution 1280x720 - Native resolution on.
Controller: LilyPad svn (r2237) 0.10.0
Sound: SPU2-X 1.1.0
Frame Limit: 60FPS
Speed Hacks: INTC Sync Hack
All other plugins are default."
,Astuzio,2011-05-27T08:44Z,Does this work on PCSX2? I'm downloading it right now and I hope it works. :/
,Astuzio,2011-05-31T08:25Z,Ugh. I can't extract this into my USB. It says no more space? Ugh. My USB has 7 GB space and the SC3 File is 4GB. >< Help please.
,Astuzio,2011-06-01T13:32Z,"Oh wait, I've already figure out my own problem. It's just that my USB is not NTFS. I converted it from FAT32 to NTFS. FAT32 doesn't allow to copy 4gb and above files."
,anirudh_lsr,2011-10-13T23:42Z,"Guys, this is my first time downloading and trying to play a ps game on my laptop, so can you please tell me how to play this?iam aware you are supposed to use some EPSXE engine, etc, but not very clear, so please gimme the details? cheers!!"
