It is better in MP3 

Wma is TOOOOOOOOOOOOO large File Format
than MP3 "
,DaMadBoy,2007-09-23T13:44Z,"These WMA's must be in extremely high quality because WMA is usually about half the size of MP3, but then as you said MP3's are much much better."
,the52poet,2008-02-07T18:15Z,"320kbps is CD quality in playback (as mp3)
Bryan Adams Everything I do is 22mb on this download and is probably running between 128 and 192kbps
I have the same song as mp3, 320kbps and it is only 15.1mb.
MP3 IS better quality AND smaller size than WMA - ALWAYS"
