NB: (1) reissued on CD (Free FR 2006).  

United Artists managed to sign several good groups (Thunder and Roses, Boffalongo, Pookah for example) but never gave them much promotion. Lead by Mark Mangold who composed their material, Valhalla is another of these forgotten groups and their album deserves to be rediscovered. It mixes heavy rock, prog and psych with a predominent organ and a powerful vocals on tracks like Psychedelic Minds Going Nowhere and Overseas Symphony.
Mark Mangold would later play with American Tears.
