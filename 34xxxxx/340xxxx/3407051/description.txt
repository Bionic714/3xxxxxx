+ RELEASE iNFORMATiON +
-----------------------
Retail for this great metalcore album. Thanks for the advance earlier but I don't
know how many of you noticed the heart-stopping, jaw-dropping skip right on the
first track at 01:02.  Long story short, it was never nuked because supposedly
it was like that on the cd, although we never saw the cd, but whatever...thanks
again.  Retail doesn't include skips or additional hazards, but if you buy it,
it comes with an extra 10kbps avg bitrate. Enjoy the beautiful crystal clear
picture. :)
