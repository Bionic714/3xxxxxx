Description from Amazon
Kitty Jay is a collection of songs written and inspired by the stories and legends of Seth?s birthplace and home of Dartmoor, it?s an ambitious disc that attempts to capture the spirit and atmosphere of the wilderness of the moor. Ambitious it may be but he?s certainly succeeded. Over the 11 tracks he creates an impressively dark and brooding atmosphere, but this is contrasted by lighter and sweeter passages spread throughout ? it?s a disc that feels natural and balanced.
