,skotm 86,2006-08-13T22:08Z,"Im not sure if you can use other GPS units to attach to your laptop (in order to run this program), but the retail program comes with a little GPS attachment that plugs into your USB. Im pretty sure that without the attachment the program is useless."
,mrbenson,2006-08-23T21:26Z,"Im not sure if I have thisversion but the program is very handy, even without GPS. It gves you directions and driving times anywhere in USA. Just finished downloading today, cool program!"
,mmoi5,2006-09-03T16:52Z,"This software contains only the US database, this does not cover Europe at all. 
The software does not however coregate for any GPS divation due to estimated precision errors like Tom Tom does. So you stand the risk of receiving a view of a car driving along side the road instead of on it."
,staln01,2008-08-16T06:25Z,"p.christer and loudze,

did either of you get this to actually work?  neither of you admitted to being able to use program yet ya's are trying to make fools of people looking for help with a problem that a lot of users are experiencing.  p.christer...i believe i saw you at another torrent site bickering as well.  is that what you do with your free time?  look to make fools of good people.  if it wasn't you at another site, i sincerely apologize.  otherwise, people like that should stay away from the WWW themselves."
