 | THE MATRIX: PATH OF NEO will follow the story of the blockbuster     |
 | motion picture trilogy THE MATRIX, THE MATRIX RELOADED and THE       |
 | MATRIX REVOLUTIONS and for the first time allow gamers to play as    |
 | Neo and become The One. A game of blockbuster caliber, Shiny also    |
 | worked closely with the Award winning talent behind the Matrix       |
 | trilogy to ensure that every aspect in design, sound and special     |
 | effects would be authentic to the original experience.               |
 |                                                                      |
 | Gamers will play as Neo, but from the moment the game begins, how    |
 | the situations play out, how they handle them, how they deal with    |
 | the events, where they go, how people react to them -- it's all up   |
 | to the gamer. They may win where Neo failed or find another way to   |
 | solve the problem - the path is now theirs to follow.                |
 |                                                                      |
 | As Neo, the choices the player makes to resolve each scenario and    |
 | the resulting consequences may have a different result than the      |
 | original films. Alternative scenarios filled with new characters,    |
 | content and storylines have all been written and planned by the      |
 | Wachowski Brothers to expand the Matrix universe and overall gaming  |
 | experience.                                                          |

 |  * Gamers will assume the role of Neo - from when he, as Thomas      |
 |    Anderson, gets the cell phone in the package from Morpheus, to    |
 |    the flying street battle in the rain against Agent Smith. ALL the |
 |    key moments that gamers have asked for have been included.        |
 |                                                                      |
 |  * Once again blurring the lines between Hollywood and interactive   |
 |    entertainment, THE MATRIX: PATH OF NEO will feature the           |
 |    likenesses of all of the films? key actors -- including Keanu     |
 |    Reeves (Neo), Laurence Fishburne (Morpheus), Carrie-Ann Moss      |
 |    (Trinity), Hugo Weaving (Agent Smith) and Jada Pinkett-Smith      |
 |    (Niobe).                                                          |
 |                                                                      |
 |  * To truly immerse the gamer in the Matrix universe, the game will  |
 |    feature a Director?s Cut of the original movie footage from all   |
 |    three films and THE ANIMATRIX as cinematic sequences to progress  |
 |    the story told from Neo?s perspective. An exclusive to THE MATRIX |
 |    PATH OF NEO, the footage was edited by Zach Staenberg, the        |
 |    Academy Award winning editor of THE MATRIX working side by side   |
 |    with the Wachowski Brothers.                                      |
 |                                                                      |
 |  * Re-creating the incredible ambience of being in the Matrix, THE   |
 |    MATRIX PATH OF NEO will feature a full orchestral score playing   |
 |    in surround sound, developed to follow the action of the game. In |
 |    addition, the games? soundtrack will feature original songs by    |
 |    the bands that were featured in the Matrix films.                 |
 |                                                                      |
 |  * The player will use martial arts, medieval weapons and guns (lots |
 |    of guns) to take on a variety of enemies, such as heavily armed   |
 |    SWAT officers; Agents of the Matrix, including Agent Smith; and   |
 |    Exiles in the employ of the Merovingian.                          |
 |                                                                      |
 |  * The game will have enhanced Bullet Time special effects from the  |
 |    films and allow gamers to dodge bullets, jump off walls and defy  |
 |    gravity and logic to recreate its most memorable scenes.          |
 |                                                                      |
 |  * To re-create Neo?s incredible range of moves THE MATRIX: PATH OF  |
 |    NEO will also feature a more sophisticated martial arts engine to |
 |    give gamers the true feeling of being The One.                    |
