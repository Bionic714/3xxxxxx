Ok, fresh off of the dvd I bought yesterday...here is Bruce Campbell's latest flick.  I must say...DO NOT get this if you are not a fan...you won't "get" it and will most likely hate it.  If you are a fan, and you like "B" movies, then go for it, I laughed my ass off, and do not regret my purchase.

The best part in the movie is the "Bar Fight" scene...."So you want to fight dirty?" LOL!

Sorry, no subs here, there were none on the dvd!  Also it should be noted, that like most of his movies, it was a multiregion dvd with ZERO encryption. ;)

This film also had some big actors in it, like Stacy Keach...

Mini Plot:

The Man with the Screaming Brain is cult superstar Bruce Campbell (Evil Dead 2), who also makes his directorial debut in this loopy blend of '50s-style science fiction thrills and slapstick comedy. Campbell plays a businessman who meets an untimely end at the hands of a vicious Gypsy femme fatale, who has also done in her ex-fianc√©e, an KGB-agent-turned-taxi-driver. Mad doctor Stacy Keach provides a solution for both men by stitching together their brains inside Campbell's dome; with no other option but to work together, the pair sent out to find their killer. What results is a broadly funny and frantic showcase for Campbell's physical comedy skills, with Ted Raimi (Spider-Man, Xena) offering hilarious support as Keach's wacky assistant.
