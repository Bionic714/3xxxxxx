FRUXO GIVES YOU... 
The Whole Ten Yards... 
The.Whole.Ten.Yards.2004.PAL.DVDR-FRUXO...

Thanks to falsified dental records supplied by his former neighbor Nicholas Oz 
Oseransky, retired hitman Jimmy The Tulip Tudeski now spends his days  compulsively 
cleaning his house and perfecting his culinary skills with his wife, Jill, a  purported assassin who has yet to pull off a clean hit. Suddenly, an uninvited and  unwelcome connection to their past unexpectedly shows up on Jimmy and Jill's  doorstep: it's Oz, and he's begging them to help him rescue his wife from the  Hungarian mob. To complicate matters even further, the men, who are out to get Oz, 
are led by Lazlo Gogolak, a childhood rival of Jimmy's and another notorious 
hitman. Oz, Jimmy and Jill will have to go the whole nine yards--and then some--to 
manage the mounting Mafioso mayhem.
