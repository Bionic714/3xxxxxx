,totalhack,2007-12-28T16:16Z,"Awesome torrent. Thanks.

No password is needed. Just make up a user name and everything works fine. 

Another great thing about this torrent is I installed it to be run directly from my computer not the cdrom and it asks if you want to check for updates.

I updated without any problems and the software still runs. Thanks again this one is awesome.

Also one last quick note, the image files are a nero format but can be opened using poweriso."
,totalhack,2007-12-28T16:19Z,p.s. will seed until a 5:1 ratio is reached
,44gambit44,2008-02-25T21:22Z,People please seed! I got 5 kids to feed! 
,Vow-Milk-Man,2008-02-28T00:45Z,These are for the old exam objectives and not the new 2006 Nov objectives. The new ones are much harder so dont get this as you will be getting out of date information
,FUCK_OFF_WEASEL,2008-07-08T18:06Z,"He's right, these are the 2003 exam CDs.
These are also in Nero NRG format, so they can't be mounted unless they are converted. Fuck, I was hoping for the 2006 exam program."
,tvsocks,2008-09-12T09:40Z,jeeze if you can't figure out (or even try) the password/user then you should not even bother trying to learn this
,palipol,2008-12-11T11:55Z,Make less kids then if you complain about feeding them.
