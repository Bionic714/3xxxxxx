Enclosed is five of Converge's full-length albums in WMA format. They are:

Caring And Killing
Petitioning the Empty Sky (Reissue)
When Forever Comes Crashing (Reissue)
Jane Doe
You Fail Me

If you enjoy these albums, please purchase them. In order to keep making music, bands need financial support, which can be provided when you purchase their merchandise. Thank you. Also, share as much as you download. I will not continue to reseed if no one is sharing.
