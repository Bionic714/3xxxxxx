Plot Summary for 
Tanging Ina, Ang (2003) from http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0368323/

The story evolves around the ups and downs of being a single mother, Ina (Ai-Ai delas Alas) 

the main protaganist. Her three husbands die and leave her with 12 children and financial 

problems that she needs to shoulder. Simple plot with a hilarious cast. Packed with laughs 

and tear-jerker scenes with movie/commercial spoofs, surely Ang Tanging Ina will make your 

heart delight.
