,kjell__orvar,2008-04-23T19:35Z,"If you ""really"" want this game, as you claim, then get your fat ass outside, go to the fucking mall and buy the shit?
If you can't find it there, buy it online.

,Rabidrock,2010-08-13T07:58Z,It doesn't make sense to ask people to seed on this page. If they've got the torrent and can seed they're probably not on this page.

,Mankemacho,2010-09-21T16:11Z,"If you want the original soundtracks you better get this torrent:
