    Told through the eyes of Kyril, a young adventurer investigating the
    sudden appearance of hideous creatures in the Island Nations,
    Suikoden Tactics unfolds another perspective to the events of
    Suikoden IV and players will discover the secrets of the legendary
    Rune Cannons. Suikoden Tactics blends classic Suikoden and RPG
    elements with tactical strategy gameplay with a host of new features
    and game mechanics to offer a gameplay experience like no other.

    This is Rhapsodia, but the Konami-USA marketing machine renamed it.
    I havent been so angry since Namco renamed Tales of Eternia (PSX) into
    Tales of Destiny 2 in the USA. Ugh! Anyway this is a great game, and
    one from your friends at Team ECHELON. Dedicated to all my friends,
    I love you guys!

    Legacy, Loyalty, Love and Respect. Fuck the rest.

    Old friendships never die.  Remember that.

Works with Hdadvance 3.0. You can load your savegame from suikoden IV but I don't know what benefits you get from that.
