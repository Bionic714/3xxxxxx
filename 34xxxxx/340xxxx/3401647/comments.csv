I came across this band in an interview with Dave Lombardo of SLAYER.  Apparently this is one of his favorite bands........"
,gregersamsa,2006-09-23T12:22Z,"Taraf de Haidouks is one of the coolest folk music groups today! If you're the least bit interested in world music and gypsy music in particular you should buy, beg, borrow or steal this album :-D"
,MickDagger,2006-09-23T14:33Z,"well, I never thought I'd be thanking anal seepage... and yet, I am.  Multumesc mult, basina!

Ever since I met the sexy girls from your area, as featured in TPB advertisements for the horny and gullible, who were the same exact girls you see in the photos and who told me to check out TdH, I've been looking for this Taraf de Haidouks.  

Interested persons should also search for ""Besh o droM"" ...roughly in the same ballpark, musically."
,buzz_uk,2006-12-12T21:33Z,Thanks. Perhaps akin to a hyperactive version of the pogues. An acquired taste but definitely recommended for those with eclectic tastes.
,jijjy,2009-12-16T10:23Z,"this is volume 2 and instantly become one of my favorite albums, might anyone have volume #1?"
,chubster53,2011-02-25T01:37Z,What a hoot this music is!  Crazy good.
