This is my first torrent. 

This is Stabbing Westward's new band, "The Dreaming".  They don't have a label yet so they are probably hurting for cash. You can buy their album here:

Its $5 for the EP and another $5 for the Bonus Tracks. The mp3s are 192kbps and come with album art. If the band is independent or if they are with a big label and I think they are truly good artists I buy their CDs. I usually buy all of their albums when I have cash to burn.
