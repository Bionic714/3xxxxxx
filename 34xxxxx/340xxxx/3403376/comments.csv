,bd0202,2008-08-06T23:32Z,"Installer isn't working for me. It begins the prep to install, but before it actually opens it just disappears. Tried compatibiliy mode & all, not working. I am trying to get V2, but I'll take this one if I can get it to work."
,bd0202,2008-08-06T23:56Z,"Disregard last, got it to install but now it's telling me that it won't run because a DLL file is moved. I'll just go ahead a nd try to get V2."
,IndianSettler,2008-08-09T00:02Z,"For those of you who are getting DLL error, you will need to downlaod d3drm.dll file from this website. Save that file in Fs Repaint folder located in program files.

http://www.driverskit.net/dll/d3drm.dll/494.html

I think this error only happened in Windows Vista.

THIS IS MY FIRST EVER COMMENT ON THE PIRATED BAY. I HOPE I HELPED.

PLEASE SEED AS MUCH AS YOU DOWNLOAD. Don't be so selfish. Leave the torrent application ON while you go sleep.

KEEP SEEDING!!!"
