Namkhai Norbu is a tibetan master of the Dzogchen tradition. He is a professor at the Oriental Institute of the University of Naples, Italy. He has authored many books including "The Crystal and the Way of Light", "The Cycle of Day and Night", and "Yantra Yoga".

In "Dream Yoga and the Practice of Natural Light", Norbu Rinpoche gives instructions for developing clarity within the sleep and dream states.

He goes beyond the practices of lucid dreaming that have been popularized in the West, by presenting methods for guiding dream states that are part of a broader system for enhancing self-awareness called Dzogchen. In this tradition, the development of lucidity in the dream state is understood in the context of generating greater awareness for the ultimate purpose of attaining liberation.

Also included in this book is a text written by Mipham, the nineteenth-century master of Dzogchen, which offers additional insights into this extraordinary form of meditation and awareness. (Chapter 5)
