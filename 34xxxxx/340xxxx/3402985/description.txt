?As observed over the last few years and as projected well into the future, the most critical factor facing the refining industry on the West Coast is the surplus refining capacity, and the surplus gasoline production capacity. The same situation exists for the entire U.S. refining industry. Supply significantly exceeds demand year-round. This results in very poor refinery margins, and very poor refinery financial results. Significant events need to occur to assist in reducing supplies and/or increasing the demand for gasoline.? -- Internal Texaco document, March 7, 1996

?A senior energy analyst at the recent API (American Petroleum Institute) convention warned that if the U.S. petroleum industry doesn?t reduce its refining capacity, it will never see any substantial increase in refining margins?However, refining utilization has been rising, sustaining high levels of operations, thereby keeping prices low.? -- Internal Chevron document, November 30, 1995
