You really will have to check out IMDB's description/links and probably external links to learn about this, I can't do it any justice. I don't want you to be disappointed. http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0390073/

I had some troubles encoding this. It didn't turn out near perfect. I can say that the picture quality is pretty decent and the motion as well. I'd say a 6 out of 10, so its not crap.

A similar movie posted by me on TPB: Love Letters of a Portuguese Nun - http://thepiratebay.org/search.php?q=Love+Letters+of+a+Portuguese+Nun

If you are interested, I put another movie up you might be interested in if you like this. It has massive amounts of gratuitous sex and nudity but is also a comedy amongst other things.  Its a Russ Meyer flick called Up! (1976). The link will always change but you will definitely find it here: http://thepiratebay.org/search.php?q=russ+meyer&video=on
