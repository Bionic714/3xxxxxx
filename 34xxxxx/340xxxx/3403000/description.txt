Description:
~~~~~~~~~~~~
"Stille" (Silence) tells in over seventy minutes the story of a mind
wondering and starts in "The First Day" with a selfanalysis. Intellect
and emotion find their discord. Fears are becoming defined and
accusations are taken notice of, followed by the courage of forgiveness,
the courage of selfperception and the inner establishment: "Not Every
Pain Hurts". Purified, same enemies are brought to trial. "Siehst Du mich
im Licht?" (Can you see me in the light?") accuser and defender are
questening themself while sitting in the same scale, discussing about
lies and defamations and penetrating their courses. Hate and desperation
are not seldom walking hand in hand with irony and cynicism, in contrast
to the sensible and selfcritical view to a unreachable love: "Deine Nähe"
(Your Closeness).

To be able to learn from every downfall, to hold on the hope to find a
light even in the darkest night and to reach the power to be able to
stand up over and over again, that's what the title "Stolzes Herz"
mediates also in the nearly two minutes longer album version
unmistakable, and builds the topical bridge to "Mein zweites Herz" (My
Second Heart), which is in a selfexplaining form not only beating for
itself alone, as this title is to be seen as one of the key moments and
as a piece of the heart of the entire record in itself. "Make it end" is
the radical settlement with all the impressions, hopes, mistakes and
experiences of the past. The fight for the own will, for the own heart.
The fight for the own life and the end of hypocrisy and the
selfcheating. No compromises!

Concluding, "Die Strasse der Zeit" (The Road of Time) brings the
circle to close in a nearly fifteen minutes timetravel and transfers
the happening to take place on an imaginary street leading back to the
past. And after the travel through the night passes, the sun drives
away the mist and from the ruins of their fathers the young and
promising culture awakes.
