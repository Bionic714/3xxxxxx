I have no drive E and daemon will not allow me to select drive e. game installed corectly but cannot play. had the same problem with another download that would work half the time. any answers?
,jetman66,2007-06-23T19:12Z,nevermind i spaced copying the crack to the install file  C:\Programfiles\sierra\FEAR. but so far so good  and guess what? any virus will be found shortly and free preview of a 60$ game before buying so its all good. nice seed.
