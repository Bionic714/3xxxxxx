this is a bunch of audio (.mp3) and video (quicktime .mov) clips from episode 5x04 of family guy, PTV.

they are all taken from the lol release of the episode and cut using QT Pro.

included are mp3s and video clips of the song 'the freaking fcc'
ive made longer versions (2min 10sec) and also shorter versions, of just the song (1min 22sec)

i watched this episode and loved it, especially the song, so i went to make an mp3 of it and then decided to make a few more versions of it and then to release it in case anyone else wanted it, but wasnt as bored as me today. 

i've also made it available in as many forms as i could be bothered making (iPod Video and 3G phone versions) as i figure the clip would work well like that, although i cant test these versions cos i dont have a vid pod or phone

if anyone wants single files then i suggest using azureus or a similar program to set file specific priorities

hope you enjoy
