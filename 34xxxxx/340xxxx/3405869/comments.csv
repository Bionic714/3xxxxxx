I was using 2005.. but now with 2006, Like Nortons, it remembers your User name.
I havent bothered installing 2006 yet because my computer is still trying to use 2005 Username.
If you try to install this and use the Serial # provided, its using the ORIGINAL username (in this case ""SofT-BesT.Net"").
It will obviously go invalid because the serial wont match the Username from where its probably based.

Not sure if thats the case, so Im posting this for additional info and for anyone else who has used this product before and is trying to upgrade because of a invalid code and no updates being given by trend.

Can't find any other serials/cracks on the net for this build.

(But.. I was planning on bying this one anyway)"
,jemtec,2006-01-11T04:42Z,"Yeah, seems like a lost cause at this point.
I guess the Spyware tool is as worthless as 2005 was.
Its got its good points, but I guess ill either be waiting or buying something myself.
Thanks for the details.. Im in the same boat and have found nothing useful for a crack either."

By using this serial number, the expiry date will become 1/1/1900, but it will never expire ;)"

,theouterwave,2006-03-24T11:34Z,"that serial works, thanks"
,stofge,2006-06-24T23:01Z,Could someone please seed? 
,arkanian215,2006-06-25T03:37Z,"jemtec... i believe if you delete the system folders in program files that will get rid of any saved settings. if that does not work, go to Run, type in regedit, look for trend micro or pc cillin or any name associated with the software that you want to uninstall completely. delete those registry files. make sure you dont delete anything else. i think that works for most programs that remember your username and such (sometimes even trial periods)"
