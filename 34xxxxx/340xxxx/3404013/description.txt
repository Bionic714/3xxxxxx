This hard rock group are most notable for the fact they included Brian Johnson, who was later in AC/DC. They came from the North-East of England and started off as a sort of poor man's Slade. Their first 45 for Regal Zonophone was a minor hit and on the strength of it, they were signed by EMI. Their first effort for EMI, All Because Of You, took them into the Top Ten. Two further but lesser hits followed and their albums sold solidly though not well enough to make the Charts. They lacked any real originality and with the onset of the punk era in 1976-77, their days were numbered. 
Geordie guitarist Vic Malcolm had previously recorded with Influence and Yellow before joining U.S.A., which became Geordie before starting to record in 1972. The band kept going until 1976, after which Brian Johnson spent a few years doing sessions until joining AC/DC following the death of their previous singer, Bon Scott. The other members did reform Geordie briefly in 1983, releasing one album, then changing their name to Powerhouse after the departure of Malcolm, and releasing one subsequent LP.
