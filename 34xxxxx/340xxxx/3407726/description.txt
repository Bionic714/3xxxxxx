These beloved old hymns, sung for generations in America?s country churches, reflect a time when Sunday morning was for Christian fellowship. They are sung here in rich harmony and with heartfelt conviction by the Stony Point Quartet, Southern gospel singers from the Appalachian region. This CD is part of the Cracker Barrel Old Country StoreÂ® Heritage Music Collection.
