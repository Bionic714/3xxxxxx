,DSMeTailer,2007-04-17T06:23Z,"TERRIBLE!!!  Don't waste your time downloading this, it is ripped from a scratched-to-fuck copy of Let's Get Free.  Over half of the songs don't even play, and the rest are nearly unlistenable.  Uploaders should be a bit more selective than this...I would be ashamed."
,strebski,2007-06-20T23:29Z,"Quality is great! DSMeTailer, I think, had poblems with player - files are real good..."
,mutual_aid,2007-08-14T03:45Z,"DSMeTailer, have you tried the mp3s in a different player?!  7500 people, so far, have dl'd this and you're the only one with problems...hmmm."

,compl3x,2008-06-22T14:16Z,"Bonus Track 1 & Bonus Track 2 are actually titled Propaganda and The Pistol respectively. Great album though, if only more Hip-Hop was like this."

,rebelseeker,2010-06-12T01:17Z,This is a strong recording. Bomb lyrics & beats to match. I'll rate it as one of the 25 best hip-hop records so far.  PEACE
