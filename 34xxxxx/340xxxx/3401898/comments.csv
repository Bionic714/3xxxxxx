,emilon,2008-05-13T16:40Z,and psx is ps emulator
,joshr_chanfan,2010-12-18T19:13Z,"psx is not an emulator.  psx is the name of the original Playstaion when it was released.  Before the slim version was created, which was then called psone."
,joshr_chanfan,2010-12-18T19:20Z,"Of the handful of emulators out there, there IS an emulator specifically called ""pSX""

However, in this case the uploader if refering to name of the origingal playstation console."
