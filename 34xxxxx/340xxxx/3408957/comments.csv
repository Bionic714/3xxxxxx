,kinkero,2007-06-28T12:12Z,"Fuck you fucking idiot! I waited a month for this download at 99.9%. And now when I finally got it, it´s now even the real movie! It´s a fucking teenage-drama called Degrassi - The next generation. How I´d like to fuck you up!!!1"
,kinkero,2007-06-28T12:40Z,Never mind. I didn´t know what this movie is about. Thought it would really be jay and silent bob....
,Ran4,2008-11-02T20:41Z,"luls... this is probably 4 episodes of Degrassi: TNG, season 4 and 5. Some jay and silent bob, but also some other things."

,OverKi11,2009-06-05T04:57Z,"*sigh* kevin smith is a fan of Degrassi, and they did a bunch of episodes on degrassi where J&SB were shooting a movie in their school, and this is supposed to be the actual movie they made.

Although I thought it was ""Jay and Silent Bob Do Canada, Eh?""

Although I understand the disappointment if this isn't even the movie.guess it's time to find out. "
,Snedra,2010-06-25T11:41Z,So is it the movie or what? Coz there IS a movie called J&SB Do Degrassi...
