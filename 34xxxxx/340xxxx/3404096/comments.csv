Surely this has the record for the longest ever time to  download/seed? Must have been a year for me but I'm glad to say it's done now.

This must be off French or Canadian TV as it has French subtitles but it's a great video transfer so well worth the time to share.

I'll seed it for as long as I can which will be a very long time hopefully."
,artaud2005,2007-04-02T21:04Z,"Soory people. I rarely check my messages so I was surprised to see so much activity on this Cassavetes classic. It sounds like it has been a long slow seed. I will get it up and running for y'all real soon. April 3rd, 2007. Cheeers"
