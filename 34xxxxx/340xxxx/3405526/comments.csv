Anyone know where I can get Rybka 1.01??"
,cdma2006,2006-03-02T09:20Z,"Apart from one .nfo and one .sfv file, it has 21 RAR files with different names. However, inside the RAR, all files have the same name. So if I unpack all 21 to the same folder, they just keep getting overwritten. Could someone tell me how I should burn this on to a CD/DVD?

Thanks.
