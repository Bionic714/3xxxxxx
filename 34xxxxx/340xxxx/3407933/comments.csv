,Meloveyoulongtime,2006-02-21T16:06Z,"i have a question, is this the original cut or the crapy ""directors cut"" done by Alan Smithee (aca, a very pissed of David lynch). 

you can tell the two apart because the original is stylishly done and is full of subtle nuoncies while the  other is more like a Heman cartoon, with the opening sequence animated (poorly) and basicaly tells you whats going to happen. Also, there is this prat of a norator who sounds like Bob Dole! 

So, which is it?"
