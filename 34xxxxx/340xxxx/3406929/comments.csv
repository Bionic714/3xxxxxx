,dannathan,2011-02-13T21:09Z,I'm new to this whole torrent thing. How do I use this for free?
,tangoandcache,2011-11-14T16:18Z,How do you install this thing? I installed to both the Program Files AND the Program File(x86) folders and nothing happened. It never showed up in Photoshop Filters and I even tried restarting my comp. I tried clicking on that UNWISE application and it says that the program isn't compatible with my system. And of course there aren't any instillation instructions so I'm lost as shit. What am I doing wrong? Can someone please help!
,tangoandcache,2011-11-14T16:50Z,"Never mind I figured it out. In case anyone is having trouble with it, install it to: Program Files (x86) > Adobe > Adobe Photoshop CS5 (or whatever version you have) > Plug-ins. It will show up in the Filters Drop Down Menu in Photoshop."
,sillytoad,2012-04-04T17:12Z,Thanks Ythan it works and is very small why would someone buy 4MiB for $120 honestly. Thanks for the upload you saved me some cash witch I would have wasted.
