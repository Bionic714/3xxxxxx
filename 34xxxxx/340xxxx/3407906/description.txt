Total Features: 57

I have released a seperate A-Patch build for Messenger 8.0 BETA. Although with Microsoft's new protection on the BETA, you won't be able to sign-in unless your passport is on the allow list. Therefore, you'll need to use a proxy which will allow you to sign-in to Messenger 8.0 BETA.

Updates (build 22):

- Added "Remove Nudge Delay" Option
- Added "Disable Nudge Shake" Option

Updates (build 21):

- Added "Remove Add Contact Bar" Option
- Added "Remove (BETA) Tags" Option
- Added "Remove Windows Live Logo"
- Added "Remove Messenger" Title
