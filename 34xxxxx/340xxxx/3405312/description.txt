Denigrated by the public, vilified by the critics, re-cut at the insistence of its producers, and finally banned by the French government as demoralizing and unpatriotic, "LA REGLE DU JEU" was a commercial disaster at the time of its original release. On the surface, a series of interlinked romantic intrigues taking place at a weekend shooting party in a country chateau, the film is in fact a study of the corruption and decay within French society on the eve of the outbreak of World War II. Its reputation firmly restored, Renoir's brilliant comedy is now widely recognized as one of the greatest films ever made.

"It remains the single most overwhelming experience I have ever had in the cinema" ? Alain Resnais
