,babylon5freak,2006-01-16T18:15Z,"NICE.

I rmeber watching this yonks ago I think i enjoyed the voice over and the other things better than the dirreftors cut which i saw recently.

I hope this is a decent version. I love Bladerunner i even bought the PC game :)


Thanks."
,osc,2006-02-13T18:38Z,"omg, i love blade runner... i recommend you all read the book originally written by phillip k. dick. "
,dark jedi,2006-03-04T22:26Z,"Thanks strangelove9,really looking forward to seeing this,just wish it would download faster LOL.
thanks again for your work

,rd_warrior,2006-05-12T07:02Z,someone PLEASE seed this...I would love to watch it. I've been wanting to get a good copy of this release for a looong time!
,Inverno,2006-07-20T11:31Z,"To confirm, the voice over work is on this file?

I remember owning it on vhs (I think, might have been laser disc.) Then when DVDs came out I bought Blade Runner and threw out the VHS without much thought. A few months later I get around to watching the dvd.. Unamused doesn't quite describe my emotions."
,Meadspead,2006-08-16T16:11Z,Superb Upload! The original with Ford's narration made this better than the DC for me.
,mavedanser,2006-10-23T00:20Z,PLEASE seed this...
,extract,2006-12-09T11:08Z,"Pretty shoddy quality, looks like a VHS Rip. My guess is that a laserdisc rip would look better than this."
,WithStupid,2007-01-16T22:58Z,"Hi, newbie here.

Which program should I use to burn the files from that download?

THX!"
,simba7777,2007-02-01T15:09Z,"Looks like a VHS rip. Thank you anyways. I just love this movie, Always felt the original version was better then the director's cut."
,kensay,2007-02-17T05:49Z,Seeders ROCK!! Thank YOU!!!!!
,zarathustra2k1,2007-04-08T13:01Z,"Yet another vote for the gumshoe-narration version - meh to the director's cut...

Know alla the dialogue off by heart - how sad is that? Mind you, it's good fun for pissing off the mates... =]"
,happymonkeywatchtv,2007-11-14T17:46Z,"nearly finished download and if this is good i will seed it, but if it sucks i will bin it, i see you can get this film if you blow your doe on a box set, that just sucks anyway thanks to the guys who have made this for us, keep up the good work.... if it is good work that is, bye"
,happymonkeywatchtv,2007-11-15T02:06Z,"well tito i can only say its just about OK thanks, but i think the industry will force me to buy what they offer in their new box set, i did think about taking the naration parts and cutting them into the new directiors cut cleaned up version, if anyone is intrested just let me know and i will post it for you."
,yomama07024,2007-12-17T01:41Z,What is the aspect ratio?
,spoogmonster,2008-01-08T17:47Z,downloaded in about 4 days used dvd decrypter to write iso to dvd worked great what a gem I have only a bad VHS copy of this original version coppied from tv in the 80-s and have been unable to order or find this movie in any way   --Thank u so much--I will seed as long as i can but my hard drive is small This downdload made my day!!!!!
,whocares401,2008-03-30T04:52Z,"Good copy of the film.  The quality isn't as good as other versions, but the SOUND is great!  Has the voice overs and a Great Sountrack with effects.  The Bonus is the 2nd Disc which has the TVO 1 hour interviews and the Complete Vangelis Sountrack.  And of course Windows Themes and Screensavers.  A worthy download but don't expect the best video quality.  For that you must find other versions that aren't being seeded."
,ddreyer,2008-12-01T01:59Z,"Hey, please seed this.  Me and the other people downloading are definitely still interested in this film.  I'd really enjoy seeing a transfer of the theatrical cut on DVD!

Thanks."
,ddreyer,2008-12-01T02:21Z,"Please seed, I'd much rather have this than the official remastered edition off the 5 disk collectors edition.  This sounds weird but this kind of not totally perfect unedited quality is part of the experience for me, please seed."
,t63094,2008-12-03T02:23Z,"for the love of god, someone seed.  there are about 5 of us at 99.3%"
,lastjedi,2009-07-21T17:31Z,"file corrupt after downloading this parts of the movie keep repeating themselves about 4 or 5 times,i have downloaded many movies and never had this problem so i know its his file."
,psidre,2010-03-06T12:56Z,"Content verified and successfully burned to DVD. This is indeed the original version with the voice-overs.  

Thank you, strangelove9 & TiT0, for this priceless release.  

Will be seeding for a generously in-determinant period to assure this gem is not lost like 'tears in the rain'. ;) "
,radumanu,2011-05-04T17:22Z,Thanks a lot!
,radumanu,2011-05-04T20:40Z,"But here quality is much much better:

,filevans,2012-01-17T23:15Z,"this is not the original theatrical cut, this is the INTERNATIONAL THEATRICAL CUT, the original theatrical cut is the american U.S. one also known as the U.S. Theatrical Cut

learn to label things accurately or don't bother uploading anything as it just causes people to download the wrong version of the film and then think they have the one they want"
,x30001wtm,2012-01-21T08:35Z,"filevans, thanks for coming in and pissing all over the floor. To people not from America, this IS the ""original"" theatrical version.  It's the first version available in theaters in other countries besides America.  Besides, strangelove9 specifically said INTERNATIONAL right in the header.

There are MANY of us who LOVE AND APPRECIATE this torrent.  Now please fuck off with your negative shit."
,vreyhr676y,2012-03-19T08:31Z,"@x30001wtm: maybe for non-USA people it is the original but is not named like that properly, its proper name is International theatrical cut, so stop being a retard about it, if other have that idea tell them is not like that and explain them why."
