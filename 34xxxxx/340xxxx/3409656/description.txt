   We are tired and disgusted by the movie industry's refusal to take care of ART and CULTURE, as
   opposed to crass oportunism and money-grabbing, prosaic formulas.  

   We therefore present you with our project: to release several such "forgotten" or criminally
   overlooked creations, for which moviegoers worldwide have been waiting for WAY TOO LONG.


	This is the first of our series:

	*** BLADE RUNNER *** 			RiPPER......: TiT0       GENRE......: SciFi/Drama
	by Ridley Scott, 1982			ViDEO TYPE..: NTSC       RUNTiME....: 117 min
	The Original Theatrical Release 	AUDiO TYPE..: DD2.0      iMDB RATiNG: 8.2
	- International Version -  		iMDB LiNK...: http://imdb.com/title/tt0083658/

	
   For various reasons, too numerous to list here, the film in its original shape was never 
   released on DVD. The only DVD version officially available is the 1992 Director's Cut.

   We believe the Theatrical Version remains an important document, among the finest films ever 
   made. It is certainly one of the most influential pictures of the genre.

   Therefore, we are proud to present you with an ANAMORPHIC transfer of the best source currently 
   in print, enhanced by a second disc of supplemental material, which includes a complete 
   and unabridged soundtrack and a RETROSPECTIVE DOCUMENTARY, plus many hours of DVD-ROM content!!!
