Game info:

F.E.A.R. (First Encounter Assault Recon) is a unique fusion
of stylized first person combat and supernatural suspense in which you
are an elite soldier trained to deal with situations others cant even
imagine. Be the hero in your own spine-tingling epic of action,
tension, and terror and discover the true meaning of fear.

A mysterious paramilitary force infiltrates a multi-billion
dollar aerospace compound, taking hostages but issuing no demands.
A Special Forces team is sent in by the government to contain the
situation, but contact is servered as an eerie signal interrupts radio
communications. When the interference subsides moments later, the team
has been obliterated. Live footage of the massacre shows an
inexplicable wave of destruction tearing the soldiers apart before
they can even react!
