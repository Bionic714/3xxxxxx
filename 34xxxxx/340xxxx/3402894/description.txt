This is a spectacular movie made by the folks at www.articlechampion.com

I am in NO WAY responsible for the creation of this movie, but I am wanting people to download it.  Since their webserver knocked them offline (the movie download was hogging all their bandwidth), they have been unable to distribute it, so I thought I'd lend a hand.

The movie itself contains a plethora of juicy martial arts action that resembles judo mixed with brawling and ninjas.  I'm sure you'll enjoy!

Please seed when you're done!
