,sonicalchemy,2008-01-13T05:03Z,"Just to confirm I have downloaded this from the link given and burned it to a disc, works perfectly except for a few MINOR misshaps on the Eng subs but nothing that fluent english speaking downloaders cannot overcome. IT's minor stuff and its in you hands in 3.5 hrs

Enjoy and thank you parkyns
