he Dark Side of OZ is a magical journey through The Wizard of OZ, scored to Pink Floyd's trippy album The Dark Side of The Moon. This sync is alternately referred to as The Dark Side of the Rainbow.

This version of Dark Side of OZ is unlike any other--a handcrafted edit with precise scoring to the soundtrack. The film was edited to fit the album. There are over 101 Synchs, more than any other Pre-Synch out there. The album plays three times to the movie with an approximate running time of 100 Minutes.

This is the feature-length presentation of Pink Floyd's "The Dark Side of the Moon" perfectly synchronized with MGM's classic "The Wizard of Oz".
