,frosty1790,2008-05-26T10:05Z,"Hey, i'm not meaning to rip on the person who made this torrent or file but do not download this. it is not in sync. i do not know if it was started at the wrong time, if it was the wrong version of the album(which is a possibility because there are a few with different song times) or if it was the wrong version of the movie. when u are watching this film you can will actually be constantly telling yourself wow it would be pretty trippy if that happened 2 or 3 seconds ago. I'm just saying this is a very delicate thing to try and sync if u want true results download the album the Dark Side of the Moon then download the Wizard of Oz ( try not to get remastered versions screws with times) and start the movie then start the album after the third roar from the MGM lion( some people believe it should be the 1st or 2nd but for best results third roar is best) sorry for the bad comment but i was a little disappointed.

if anyone knows of any well synced iPod versions please message me =)   thx"
