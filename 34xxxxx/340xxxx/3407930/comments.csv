"
,gabriel1475,2009-11-03T05:51Z,"Holy snap!  The name and serial number still work!  I must agree with what the previous commenter said about the people at Apple being idiots....considering the comment which contains the name and serial is from 2008, and still works!!  Ha!!!!   Please everyone, steal from this horrific company each and every chance you get. Filthy Apple scumbags...hope that the parents of their CEO drink a little too much wine at their 50th wedding anniversary, get arrested on their way home for driving under the influence, and both get butt-raped in a holding cell because the guards are preoccupied with their latest Apple device in the lunchroom to notice.  Death to Apple! "

,chostetler15,2010-09-21T04:09Z,not sure if it has a virus in the setup folder but after i downloaded and entered keygen it started making my windows desktop flash black every once in a while. i have display fusion that over rides any desktop display settings so i think i wasnt able to see any of the changes that the program may have been trying to change. but as with what others have said if you already have version 7 just add the user and password and that cant be corrupt
,muhibraza,2010-09-30T20:15Z,hey thanks ccloyd :) that was so simple even on version 7.6.8 :) got pro in seconds :) thanks a lot
