QuickTime Professional Edition v7.0.3.50
========================================
This is the Professional Edition of QuickTime without iTunes Setup. It contains a valid working serial too. The download is just 19 MB coz iTunes has been stripped and the package was compressed by my favourite compression software - WinRAR. [WinZIP, you've turned 10 but you still have long way to go baby, before you can reach the compression levels of WinRAR :p ]
