In Jacksonville, to determine if Republicans were using "caging lists" (1,886 names and addresses of voters in traditionally Democrat areas of Jacksonville, Florida.) or other means of intimidating voters, newsnight filmed a private detective filming every "early voter" - the majority of whom are black - from behind a vehicle with blacked-out windows. The private detective claimed not to know who was paying for his all-day services. On the scene, Democratic Congresswoman Corinne Brown said the surveillance operation was part of a campaign of intimidation tactics used by the Republican Party to intimidate and scare off African American voters, almost all of whom are registered Democrats.
