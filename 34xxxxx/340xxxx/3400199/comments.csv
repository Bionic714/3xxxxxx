,pffffft,2006-05-21T17:59Z,"I'm suspecting that ep.5 and 21 contains viruses (Trojans), so if anyone could find these two separate, it would be nice.

P.S. I have checked these two files a few times, and they always trigger the two same ones."

,arufener,2007-11-19T08:43Z,"hey I found a codec that you can download and install that will provide sound if you don't have it.  You can download this torrent: http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3809846/K-Lite_Codec_Pack_3.4.5_Full_%5BDXO%5D

Installed and it works great now.

Thx"
