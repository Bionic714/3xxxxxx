XIII (Xbox) 


Ubi Soft introduces cel-shading to the First-Person Shooter genre with XIII for the PlayStation 2, Xbox, GameCube and PC. Discover the secrets of the conspiracy-rich plot and find out the mysterious connection between your shrouded past, and the President's assassination. Become a master of both stealth infiltration and weapons-based combat in order to survive a relentless slew of enemies. Strategically switch between silent weapons such as the deadly crossbow, or distance and power weapons like the sniper rifle and machine gun. Immerse yourself in an epic conspiracy story with a visual style straight from the pages of a comic book.
