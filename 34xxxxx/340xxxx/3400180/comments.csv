,apisit82,2006-01-11T15:33Z,where is the audiofile?  the  AUDIO_TS is emty?!!! where can i get the missing files?
,swoopbit,2006-02-19T16:01Z,"apisit82:
you mus be a total moron! AUDIO_TS folder is always empty - not used part of the standard. as a matter of fact, it can be even left out. the ""audio file"" you ask about is embedded into the video objects (.vob files). just play it adnd you will see (hear)."

,Arrowstream,2007-09-02T16:03Z,"Tried to download...no seeds.
But nvm. For those who can't get subtitles: don't burn it onto a DVD. play it in VLC and go into the subtitle menu. Try all the different ones until you find English. Easy. After having looked at the files in this torrent, I can say that VLC would work perfectly."
