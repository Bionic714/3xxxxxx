I'd very much like to see it again, but without the image fritzing out all the time due to being an ancient tape. Might buy the thing one day, if I can find a local DVD. Anyway, it's rather unfortunate that there are no seeders, as more people really ought to see this film. I'd recommend it for freakyflicks' collection."
