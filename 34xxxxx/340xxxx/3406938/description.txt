OK here we go again. The stupid torrent client (Azureus) says I only have 98.9% of the file when I try opening my old torrent, but it is wrong since it is the exact same file I used last time I seeded this so I decided to recreate a new torrent once again.

Info on this torrent can be found here

Enjoy.
