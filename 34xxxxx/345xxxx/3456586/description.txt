Nirvana Bootography Review:
This review is the same as the on for "Play the F@@@ing Guitar, Man." The artwork in "Out of the Blue" is better but does not contain the bonus tracks found on "Play the F@@@ing Guitar, Man." The latter is a clone of Out of the Blue which is accurately titled because it literally surfaced from nowhere. Out of the Blue was originally released in 1994.

This disc is the "Roma" of the Bleach era. You will not find a better sounding Bleach era show. 

This is what a bootleg recordings are all about... You can also get this show on it's clone "Play the F@@@ing Guitar, Man." The show was recorded for radio in Austria, and the sound is perfect. You may prefer this over it's clone "Play the F@@@ing Guitar, Man" if you appreciate extra artwork. "Play the F@@@ing Guitar, Man" contains tracks from another show that are not available on this disc. 

You can tell the band was having a good time at this show. The setlist was typical (except for the encore), however, the unique thing about the show is a drunk guy that screams at the band throughout their performance. You hear this guy with a German accent screaming "PLAY ABOUT F@@@ING GIRLS!!!!"... "TUNE YOUR F@@@ING GUITAR AND PLAY ABOUT F@@@ING GIRLS, MAAAAAAAAAAAAN!!!!!!!"... Krist has a good time with him and yells back several times during the show and at one point sings some lines from The Who's "I'm a Boy" and dedicates it to the heckler. The entire show is wild and full of energy. 

"Help me, I'm Hungry" is played as an encore, and is the best known recording of the song. You can hear some kind of sound repeating in the background when the band breaks between songs... I think it's soundclips of Arnold S... (the Terminator guy), there must be a reason, because the repeating sounds can be heard during other 1989 German shows.
