This was one of my favorite 80's cds. Just a great feel good effort. Great melodies and vocals from Dave Bickler. I felt like Survivor went bubblegum after he left. This one had at least 4 potential radio hits and never got any air play. That sort of thing started happening alot after MTV cranked up and injected cancer into the american music scene. This cd rocks. You definitely won't be sorry you downloaded it. Their first cd is very good as well.
