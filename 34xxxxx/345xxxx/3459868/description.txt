Tennis - Pacific Life Open 2006 Final
Roger Federer vs James Blake


This is a fairly low quality encode but I'm just putting it out there in case anyone wants it. It is perfectly watchable (you can see the balls and the players, it just doesn't look/sound that great)

Also: The video is interlaced, and the aspect is a bit off, so use a player that can deinterlace and change aspect ratio.
