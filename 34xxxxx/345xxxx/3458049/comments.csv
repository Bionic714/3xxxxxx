This is most important in music, in Classical Piano  wave is absolutely mandatarory. In Jazz or pop music DTS is also quite good... Dolby is generally bad except PLIIxMusic, wich was invented elsewhere but not in Ray DOLBY's premises..."
,sushimaharaja,2006-03-18T04:09Z,Audio is MP3 I'm afraid.  
,sushimaharaja,2006-03-18T04:10Z,"Dialogue in Russian and French, subtitles in English."
,Mr_Ecks,2006-03-18T11:13Z,Could somebody seed? It's a bit of a bum-vax to have disc 2 but not disc 1.
,Mr_Ecks,2006-03-18T15:30Z,Thank You for a marvelous film! I'll seed for some hours.

,Hezbollatte,2008-04-03T01:31Z,"Will someone either seed or get these torrents off the website?!! For the past six months or more, CD 1 stops loading at 86%, CD 2 stops at 99%. Unusable files. So please, SEED OR DISAPPEAR!!"
,drviolin,2008-05-12T16:58Z,"Please seed!!!! The files are pretty much useless the way they are. 

To Salustius: Don't be so particular about technicalities. Richter's playing has nothing to do with how well you can measure frequency response of your audio system. In Richter's day, there was no PCM, and he sounded just fine. So deal with it."
