,freduza,2006-03-29T19:29Z,Mapinfo is a program you produce maps with. Many institutions and professional mapmakers use it. Geographers use the program in conjunction with GIS (geographical information systems)

,ratmuskas,2008-07-16T15:00Z,How does the crack work?
,BigDancingBear,2008-08-04T07:09Z,"Nice DL snafuu! ratmuskas, here is how the crack works, or at least how it worked for me:
Click on MapInfo[1].Professional.v7.8-SHOCK and continue to extract files until you reach an application file called shkMIP78, that is the crack. But before you activate, click on the application called MIPro78eval, NOT the MIPro78patch! Once you click on MIPro78eval, run through all screens until finished. Then, click on your crack shkMIP78; however it is looking for ...\mapinfow.exe, browse to the MapInfo folder in Program Files and click on the file in ""CAPS"" instead, MAPINFOW.exe, then click on Patch it!!  Bingo, you now have cracked Map Info Professional v7.8  In my opinion, don't mess with the MIPro78patch nor the MPro7tutorial, I have not been able to make them work. If anyone else has any ideas please let me know. Thanks!  P.S. I'm still looking for MapInfo Professional v9.5 if anyone can crack it!"
,AZININ,2009-01-28T14:20Z,I'm looking for MapInfo Professional v9.5 if anyone can crack it! please...

,bert745,2010-08-09T08:34Z,Version 10.5 is now the current version.
