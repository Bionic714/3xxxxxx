bobdaslob: Why do you hate America?"
,piotrillo,2006-03-18T07:10Z,"Wake up call: Americans love America, and that's pretty much it. Others maybe don't really *hate* it, but close."
,Porkster,2006-03-18T07:41Z,"Good work.  keep them coming.

Someone should organise a pseudo public 911 court trial and ask important questions.  Video tape it all and release onto internet or world tv if they will touch it.  Holocaust Theory could be another subject."

,Raziel36,2006-03-18T12:55Z,"Funny, isn't it?  How people will purposely search for these torrents just to tell everyone that it's garbage and not to download it.  If they truly believed that, why would they feel the need to do such things?!  The fact is that the ""facts"" of 9/11 are rarely talked about in public forums and even frowned upon in the comfort of your own home.  While some of the commentary on these videos can be a little far-fetched and sound like they are addressing children, the facts included can't be dismissed, nor can they be challenged.. they are what they are.  Scientists wouldn't go near a camera on this subject if they didn't feel they had important information.  Many scientists have said that nothing that happened with the buildings that fell should have been reactions to what happened to them.  Fact is, there should still be buildings in those 3 spots.. not horribly attractive after being burned and crashed into, but standing, nontheless.  If the nay-sayers would just sit back and watch some of these documentaries, they'd be hardpressed to not be, at least a little, curious about how much our government knew/was involved with what happened that day.  Like it or not, some day you'll have to realize that not only did you support one of our worst presidents ever(Hard to call him that, since he was never truly elected, anyhow) but you are also supporting a murderer.  I, personally, hope you have a long string of restless nights when you come to terms with the truth."

,vampire_pirate,2006-03-18T17:02Z,"When you've finished adjusting your tin foil helmet, don't forget to check out ReVIsed's other great torrents where he tells us that the biggest threat to the world today is in fact the secret conspiracy of Gay Jews who are being supplied with weapons by a pyramid-building alien culture from the other end of a hyperspace corridor to Neptune. 

Because this cunt is a homophobe and a racist and a Nazi lover. Don't trust a word the cunt says. It's just a big game to him."

Bush and Cheney are at an all time presidential low of 35% in recent popularity polls and even far righters like Norm Coleman are saying the Bush presidencty is incompetent. Kepp up the good work, you guys are doing great :) :) :)"

,some guy in a cave,2006-08-19T06:08Z,"Sorry xiando, no disrespect meant to your very well written, and highly informed words, but myself, despite all the anger in me caused by this shit, I can?t wish sleepless nights on people who are (for the most part at least) victims of those peoples lies too? If you were never, even for a moment, a victim of those peoples lies too, then you are indeed a very rare member of our species. I know I was a victim of these lies for a long time,  and I remember the anguish the revelation caused me. Personally I couldn?t wish that on another victim, regardless that it is inevitable they will put themselves through it.

,some guy in a cave,2006-08-19T06:11Z,"As for bobdaslob?. A couple of  thoughts especially for you. 
Firstly. If  - despite all appearances - you actually turn are one of the masses of burger chewing denial monkeys that I addressed previously, then here?s some serious advice for when the realisation hits home. Please, don?t try and explain your actions, just run and hide. "
,some guy in a cave,2006-08-19T06:12Z,"I?m sorry to say that there?s a witch hunt coming in the wake of what is yet to come - assuming theirs enough of our species left to form a respectably sized angry mob that is - and I?m afraid your remarks on this site are going to be enough for that inquisition to scream complicity at you, and then, if they can find you, you?re fucked"
,some guy in a cave,2006-08-19T06:12Z,"2) If xiandos claims about you are right, and to be honest, I suspect he/she is spot on, then I wouldn?t rely on any help in your attempts to escape the aforementioned witch hunt. The betrayal of the human race into the clutches of these tyrants that anyone who has watched this film should at least be concerned that they may be doing by denouncing it, would be enough to see even your dear old gran looking at you with hate in her eyes. I?m an atheist, always have been bob, but you know what, I hope I?m wrong. It would be worth the fundamental jolt to my psyche to have it proved to me, beyond any doubt, that hell awaits you and all your kind for what you?ve done and are still trying to do. I don?t believe for a second exists.

The material in this video adresses the unanswered questions on why the building collapsed.

To all of you who just donÂ´t want to beleive these theories.
Why not be open to alternate explanations to what realy happened. Instead you fend like crazy, defending yourselves like someone is accusing you.
The people making these vidoes are not terrorists or muslim fundamentalists or commi-bastards, japanese, germans or iraqi dictators. No anti-american boogeyman but made by americans. 
Try to have an open mind an stop the namecalling and the ""yourĂŠ just jealous of us, the best country in the world"" shit..."
,duhprane,2007-02-19T06:05Z,"bobdaslob is frightened of the civil possibilities acceptance of what many already accept as the truth about 9/11..... civil upheaval, dollar collapse, martial law.... bob, these things are coming anyway whether or not you accept the sad sad truth of 9/11.... "
