Koinonia - Discography 4cd

Koinonia is a music group that were around in the early 80's -- their first public appearance was in LA's "Baked Potato" in 1980. The name comes from Greek, and means "to fellowship" or "to communicate by the act of using as common". They are all Christian (studio) musicians that have been (and still are) playing with a lot of other top names, and they decided to name their own "fellowship" group like that because of their common roots.
