This app craps out after creating two disks with the following error: ""DVD burner opean failed. Please check if there is any DVD burner driver and there is a recordable DVD disc in the driver.""

Installed it on a second system with the same results after two disks. All of my other burning software still worked. Did a complete uninstall of the Xilisoft DVD Creator and reinstalled. No change.

Too bad -- other than its excruciating slow transcoding process it's a nice app from the standpoint of simplicity.

Caveat emptor."
