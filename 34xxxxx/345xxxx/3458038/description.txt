Although not rare, this ep from 1992 is rarely heard even by fans as it is the only one not included in a compilation thus far, despite having a reputation as one of their greatest records. Defining example of their early sound. Presented here in the brilliant WMA lossless format. 

The tracks:

1. Lo-Fi
2. <Varoom!>
3. Laissez-Faire
4. Elektro (He held the world in his iron grip)

Don't forget to listen to "Elektro" all the way through!
