Floyd Cramer recorded this Blues album in the early 60's. I believe this to be the best unheard Blues album ever recorded. F. Cramer basicallt recorded C&W. Hard driving piano accompanied with sax, trumpet, etc. DL "I'll Never Be Free" to best sample this album. Excellent fidelity and Stereo imaging ripped from CD employing VBR / Highest Quality / Multiple Sampling

NOTE: Sentimental Journey was not on the original Hello Blues album and I have no idea why it was added with the release of the CD. It's certainly not a blues arrangemnt and has no business on this album. Delete It!!

Enjoy
