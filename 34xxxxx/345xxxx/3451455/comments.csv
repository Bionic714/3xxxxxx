,Fratyinside,2006-03-01T23:55Z,Thanks for teh game been going crazy without it of course now I have to wait for it to download and if it doesn't work...then feel my wrath.
,blackrave123,2006-03-02T00:00Z,Archatos is really right! This site reports wrong all the time. You can't trust those numbers! Maybe you should check before saying other people are wrong. You're wrong yourself!
,salaris,2006-03-02T00:02Z,THX
,BeppasWolgas,2006-03-02T00:02Z,Anyone know if it is possible to install this if your Sims 2 is in other language than english?
,blackrave123,2006-03-02T00:04Z,"BeppasWolgas: I think this is multilanguage, even if it's not mentioned in the info. You should be able to install this in any language."
,blackrave123,2006-03-02T00:05Z,But don't get angry if I'm wrong. I'm downloading this from another tracker where I'm sure it's multilanguage.
,Lounix,2006-03-02T00:21Z,"Thank you rs04, for adding the torrent!

I was #1 to grab it, i looked for this needle in the haystack for hours before i found it here.... =)

BeppasWolgas, yes you can install the game over any other language, but there might be mixed languages in the game.

,requiemforakat,2006-03-18T01:02Z,"can someone help me...

For some reason, when I try to burn the image to cd, it doesn't work.  I use alcohol 120%, and it says that it has burned successfully.. but when I put the CD into the drive, it can't read it properly.  It just spins and stops, spins and stops.

I tried mounting the disk and it will install, but it of course, it asks for me to insert the disk when I try to run it.  I tried using Safedisc 4 1.0, but it won't work.  I can't find Safedisc 4 1.1... can anyone help me?"

,zalinequeen,2006-04-02T23:50Z,"I've unzipped the file and burned the .mdf file onto a cd. I installed the program and it worked fine. I tried to then load the program but the main icon shows up on the screen, and then freezes. The game itself never loads. I tried to mount the files from the unzipped folder, but the .mdf isn't mountable with Daemon V3.47 (is this the most recent version?) and the .mds isn't either.

PS - I had to burn the CD with Alcohol instead of Nero since Nero doesn't burn .mdf files.

So is my problem the daemon program I'm using, or that I should be doing something else? Thanks!"

I grabbed Safedisc Hider 1.1, and cureROM, tried using both, got the same result.  When I load the game, it installed fine, I get Sims 2 Night Life splash, and when the load bar fills, the music hangs and I get an empty warning message, and the program crashes.  I've also tried mounting the image fixes from gamecopyworld, and even tried the .exe fix.  I've uninstalled and reinstalled more times than I can count.  I am offically stumped."

,Shut_Me_Up,2006-10-01T12:29Z,"Some of you seem to be having problems.

Once you've downloaded the file, extract it using WinRAR or some similar program. You will have a folder with an image (.mdf) file. Use Daemon tools to burn the image to a CDR, and then mount the image. Put the CD in, and the install wizard will open. Install it. There are serials included in this download, use them. Then use SafeDisc4 Hider 1.1 ensure that the liscense problems you're sure to have aren't a problem anymore (just open the image file in SD4 and click hide). Now run the game! This worked for me.

If anyone has any problems, post and I will try to help."

any ideas?"

download WinRAR to extract the files
(WinRAR extracts iso, bin, and cue files)
download Daemon Tools Lite
(Daemon tools is like having a virtual CD/DVD ROM and it's FREEWARE, so you'll have it forever)! 
type in the serial and install
run daemon tools to mount the (file) image to your ""drive""
and play!!!
its too easy...
If you have problems ask me and I'll do my best to help!

HELP please..."

,the_sophist,2008-07-12T22:14Z,"this worked perfectly for me. 
things you need: winrar, alcohol 120, a blank CD, and the sims 2 on CD.
unpack with winrar. take the mdf file and drag it into alcohol. burn image. take the cd out. put the cd back in. it should open. type in one of the cracks below (i used the last one, it worked). it'll ask you to put in your sims 2 cd, do that, and you're golden."

,HollywoodCity,2008-09-10T17:14Z,Thank you!
,CopperStar,2008-11-16T06:53Z,"Will this work if you have later expansions? The idea with Sims 2 is that if you have later expansions you use the latest disc, so if i have Seasons but not this, am I able to use this without needing any kind of hacks, cracks, flmaing monkeys or anything?"
,CopperStar,2008-12-10T11:20Z,"..turns out, if University is anything to go by, this is true. You do not need a CD crack if you have a later expansion, and since I own a proper version of Seasons, I can run University fine and probably this too!"
,StevenK08,2009-06-06T16:40Z,"IF IT ASKS FOR ANOTHER DISK WHEN YOU RUN THE GAME DO THIS:

Go to the original Sims 2 installation and run it from there using the original sims 2 disk or mounted original sims 2 disk.

Although it will not say Open for Business on the loading screen the expansion pack will still work.

For example, instead of opening 'The Sims 2 open for business' open 'The Sims 2'.

Worked for me, hope it does for you too."
