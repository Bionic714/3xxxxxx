,thebadman77nyc,2006-03-13T01:19Z,Take the time to look at each and every photo. look at the pain and loss. look at the devistation. then rethink your insensitive empty comment. and while your at it go fuck your non american self.

,darth wader,2006-05-20T18:00Z," PC Mag has an article about a recent discovery of a trojan found in jpg files. ""When the jpg that has the trojan is viewed it (the trojan) is downloaded and executed. Currently the code does not propagate, infecting only the machine the jpeg is viewed on. The trojan allows the victim's machine to be controlled remotely.""
so your a truckdriver eh???"
