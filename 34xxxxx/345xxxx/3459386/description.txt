Genre: anime Comedy



Oe Kintaro is a 25-year-old freeter, which is someone who travels from job to job. It's not that he's incompetent or that he doesn't care, but once he learns something, he moves on. He dropped out of Tokyo University law school (only after finishing his graduation requirements early) to learn more about life. With his trusty mountain bike and notebook in hand, Kintaro's adventures have just begun.
