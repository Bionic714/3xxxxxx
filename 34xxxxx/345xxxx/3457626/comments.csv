,Extreme!,2006-03-16T19:36Z,does it need a crack ? it keeps asking for a cd
,Jayilla01,2006-03-16T23:26Z,shouldn't need a crack...works just fine for me without a cd or crack...you need to keep the disk image open while you play the game...it acts like a cd
,Scozzers,2006-03-20T15:08Z,"Just go to www.damnr6.com - there is a nocd img in one of the categories (misc, I think). Lot's of nice mods too :)
I recommend ""Frostbite"" - under ""total conversions"".
There is also info on how to convert the pc expansion pack ""Island Thunder"" for use with mac version :P
Any newbies here, check out Gameranger - always plenty of Ghost Recon games happening."

,theanimaster,2006-10-09T12:14Z,Can somebody seed this? Got up to 415MB and then -- kaput!
,theanimaster,2006-10-17T14:00Z,"AAAAAAAAuuuuuUgggGGGHHHH.

I was expecting STARCRAFT Ghost Recon... NOT ""Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon"". Boy was I suckered.

Damn... I just got the names mixed. StarCraft doesn't have the word ""Recon"" in it. Oooooops.

Oh well... a game's a game."
