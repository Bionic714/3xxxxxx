I forgot to mention. Included in this torrent are videos of PlayStation3 trailers. That's why it's 100MB. Sorry!

These trailers play nice on your PSP with this media player!

Killzone - PS3 
Metal Gear Solid 4 - PS3
Motorstorm - PS3"
,damnit199,2006-03-17T11:42Z,"I encoded these trailers from DVD's, so they are very High Quality at 480x272 resolution.

Killzone/Motorstorm from E3 Access Sony DVD.
Metal Gear Solid 4(TGS ver) from Metal Gear Saga Vol.1

Will upload the E3 Sony Conference for PSP Media Player. Sony unveiled PlayStation3 for the first time in that 2 hour video."
,DickySwing,2006-03-19T18:51Z,"Thank you for this. The videos you included works perfect, but it wont play my own videos. it just keeps counting 'waiting for video to be initialized.' Right now I am trying to play a file that isn't bigger then 6 MB, but it have counted up to 2500, and just keep counting  =/"
,damnit199,2006-03-19T20:33Z,Make sure you've re-encoded your videos at 480x272 res and with singlepass Xvid at 1024bitrate. Unselect Qpel/BVOPS. Keep mp3 bitrate constant. Any above gives problem.

,DickySwing,2006-03-20T19:02Z,okay! but what should I use to convert my files?
,damnit199,2006-03-21T00:48Z,Use Virtualdub if you're a pro. Goto www.videohelp.com for tutorials on Xvid encoding. Or use any 1click videoconverter programs out there. Your choice but do it with the figures I told ya before.
,ravenn,2006-03-21T22:30Z,"My psp says it's a damaged file and won't work, any suggestions on how to fix it? I'm running on v2.6"
,perciuss,2006-03-23T00:06Z,It doen't work on psp firmware >1.50
,CloudyDragon,2006-03-23T18:46Z,"I put the files in the right place as you said, where do i put the Video files?

Also it tells me the video player is corrupted, this is a good idea, and I would like to get it working. =("
,damnit199,2006-03-24T05:41Z,Those with PSP with firmwares above 1.5. You're screwed! Not entirely though. AVI player is a homebrew and you know homebrew doesn't work for 2.0+ PSPs. Unless you have GTA UMD with eboot loader utility. The files in this torrent are readymade for 1.5 PSP. Anyone else would have to do the eboot loader trick. Go somewhere else for tutorials about that please.
,Pavosenheska,2006-04-02T14:18Z,can this app. show up subtitles?
,tio2006,2006-04-10T09:57Z,"Excuse me, but something is not working, for example, I have an emulator in my psp, and for this to work I had to put the folders emulator and emulator% inside the game folder but outside in the root there is another emulator folder, where is this folder for the avi player, can someone help me."
,bluzzert,2006-04-17T13:39Z,this torrent is dead
,damnit199,2006-05-23T03:46Z,"tio2006

You don't need any other folder except for the ones for the GAME folder. There is no folder required for the root directory of PSP. Only two folders for GAME directory n that's it. "
,TheSourMango,2009-01-19T21:27Z,"Running CFW 5.0 m33-4 and cant get it to work, doesnt start, just prints an error. other homebrew apps seem to work (psptube)"
,numberone123,2009-01-24T08:02Z,You need the 1.50 kernel addon
