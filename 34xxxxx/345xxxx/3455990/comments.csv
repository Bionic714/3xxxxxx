,peterlo,2008-05-12T06:04Z,"Your file note indicates ""digital remastering"" & MP3 encoding at 320bps.
Well I can hear the result which is nicely detailed & bright, but about 1 in 3 of the files can't be opened (Media Player Classic) & most of the others contain distict audio flaws which spoils the whole collection.
Obiwan - thanks for the effort but can you remedy this please.
