It's because our tv sets does NOT show ntsc although our boxes are modded. So now you know why.

--> Because PAL versions have better (HIGHER) resolutions. PAL has got 768x576 and NTSC has got crapy 640x480! If You don't believe me http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/07/Videores.png/640px-Videores.png"
