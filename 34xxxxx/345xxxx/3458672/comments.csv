,drtysnchz,2006-03-18T07:41Z,"craxtion4 is the best for multi game, but other progs are better for other stuff."

,Mortal Paladin,2006-03-20T01:33Z,for some reason both of the games freeze for me when loading the start of the games.
,meddie,2006-03-20T23:36Z,"Well it worked wery god for me and a lot of others, it is maybe a problem with your unrar packing prog"
,Mortal Paladin,2006-03-21T06:30Z,LOL all is good I did some research and all I had to do is set my clock to he correct date. Turns out only a few games have this protection haha but I guess this is old news anyways. Thanks for the Double Pack Meddie.

,BrainCancer,2006-03-24T09:09Z,Does not work for me. I have the date set correctly maybe it does not work on softmods.
,BrainCancer,2006-04-02T09:39Z,Do not burn with Nero both games will stall at loading screens if you do that.   I burned with dvd decrypter and they work perfectly now.
