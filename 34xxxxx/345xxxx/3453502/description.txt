from imdb:
The Pink Panther cartoons were most consistently good during the 60s, and this is one of the best. Late one night, Pink drifts into a small desert town and settles in the apparently deserted hotel. To his horror, the hotel is haunted, and he spends the rest of the night being chased around by a ghost and a skeleton, until just before sunrise, when the town sheriff arrests Pink, the ghost, and the skeleton for disturbing the peace with all the noise they've been making.

It's fast-paced, imaginative, funny, and creepy, especially whenever the skeleton appears with its clattering jaws. Creepiest of all is the ending, when the sun rises, and everyone and everything disappears, except for Pink, who wanders off into the desert.

Swedish Panthers rules for first time one dude only as this far we rel. only old titles for now..
