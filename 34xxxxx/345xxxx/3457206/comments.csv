,LucisFerens,2006-10-25T15:35Z,"-VIRUS WARNING-
This thing srewed my Slackware box up.
I installed it following the instructions (come on, that was not *so* difficult to undesrand) then I installed the local update I found at http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3522467/cedega-engine-5.2.6-local-update.i386.cpkg
Then I tried to install a game,it took some 15 hours to complete the install, and it didn't work anyway, then, after the first reboot, I got such a long line of errors that I couldn't do anything but reinstall the OS from scrach.
No biggie, I always have my OS's on relattively small dedicated partitions, so my data storage was OK, but I have to warn you:
This thing is a virus."
