hmm unsure which to download now."
,abast,2006-03-17T12:50Z,"The file is this size because it is a HR.HDTV, higher resolution than usual. Try it, you will never go back to standard def :)

It even looks better on standard definition TVs, but you will only get the full benefit on a HD-ready TV or projector, or if you are watching directly on your computer."
