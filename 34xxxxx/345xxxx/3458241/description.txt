Hubert Dreyfus' lectures on Heidegger's Being and Time.

This is a recorded Berkeley course taught by Hubert Dreyfus in 2002 on Martin Heidegger's 1927 book Being & Time. The whole 35 hour 29 minute course is on this one book, which itself is hailed as the most important philosophical book of the 20th century, comparing in stature only with Wittgenstein's Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus.

These lectures used to be on Hubert Dreyfus' site ( http://ist-socrates.berkeley.edu/~hdreyfus/ ) but they are no longer - rumour has it that Mr. Dreyfus found out he didn't have the copyright to his own lectures!

Martin Heidegger was born in Germany, & was the premier 20th century ontologist.

Hubert Dreyfus is one of a handful of major living philosophers, living in the USA.

If there are any requests for the book itself (Being and Time) i will post a torrent of it. Otherwise, i know there is a torrent floating around of it & its original german version Sein und Zeit.
