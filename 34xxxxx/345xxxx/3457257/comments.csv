,pirate_tux,2006-03-15T08:23Z,"it says unable to install and asks for some qualifying product with ""license key"" field?.. :("
,pirate_tux,2006-03-15T08:42Z,"as I've figured out that serial is only for the upgrade. in the other case it does need some quakifying product with license key, which has to be in a FileMaker ""package""."
,MTQ,2006-03-15T09:00Z,"Thanks

No, you don't have to install it
you just have to enter a FM Pro Dev 7 s/n where it ask for a license key, and you can find this s/n in Serial Box"

,peeeet,2006-10-07T14:15Z,"Thanks a lot!
This one even includes the Windows files.
After unpacking with WinRAR rename *. toast to *.rar and unpack again!
Use the setup file to install (don't bother to write a CD)."
