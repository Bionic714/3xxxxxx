This is the first torrent I've put on piratebay, how come its not searchable? I thought maybe its just slow, but its been a day now, is it usually that long? What I mean is search for kats, this torrent wont show up in the results."
,ratty2,2006-03-27T08:30Z,"BTW I downloaded these from the swatkats.us forums, just giving credit. It's a great site for Swatkats fans."
,Kothoga,2006-04-20T02:00Z,Great show. to bad it got cancelled after 23 episodes. I loved watching this as a child
,Aku-Aku,2006-05-13T20:09Z,"Hm, stuck on zero... Please seed more...

,k600,2006-08-13T16:33Z,"@Ratty2

 I tried to download them from these torrents, but the speed were too low, so I went to swatkats.us to see if I could download them there.. But I couldn't find i ;p soo, could you give me some directions? 
It would be great! I loved this show as a child, but haven't seen it in ages :(("
,ratty2,2006-08-14T17:23Z,"I just reseeded it now so speeds should be good again.

I looked again and they are still on the front page of www.swatkats.us, its right on the front page, those links right look like its a blog or something but if you hover over the links you can see they are links to AVI files. I made the torrent because I wasnt sure how long that dude would continue to host them like that, but he still is, so get it either from this torrent or that site, they should both work for now.

It is a little dissapointing that as soon as I stop seeding, everyone else stops, but I guess that is just the nature of public torrent trackers."
,ratty2,2006-08-14T17:28Z,"Wow wtf is with pirate bay...
It chops off the right side of comments.
If it chops it off for you, maximize your browser."
,k600,2006-08-14T17:40Z,"I found out what to do :)

[T],rage!,2008-07-09T06:57Z,"@ Vitek/88 

Dude seeding is what you do after you have finished downloading the torrent. You upload it to others trying to dl it. So, to do this dont stop the torrent after youve reached 100%"

,DarkSmokey,2010-01-06T01:38Z,"Thanks a lot ratty2

awesome show, loved it when i was a kid...and surprisingly, love it now aswell

by the way, the reason why they only made 1 season was that Hanna-Barbera thought it was too complicated to have a show with violence, so they remained with jetsons, flinstones, smurfs, etc.
and juts FYI, the show was the number one animated show  (syndication) in like '94-'95 in terms or rating.
the cancellation was a real shame, if you ask me"
,DarkSmokey,2010-01-06T01:40Z,"sorry for the noob double posting, just wanted to say that the speed was on average 1.5-2 MB/s, with a peak of around 5MB/s...
and the quality is great

so stop whining and seed"

Keep up the good work all seeders. :)"

,fcb...6,2012-08-01T11:08Z,seed pep's
,BodrovJrFan,2012-09-05T20:57Z,"Okay. I haven't the slightest clue why, but in the moonsong download the last four episodes just completely don't work. I get a message saying the file is broken or missing no matter what program I use. One more thing; these are not high quality. These episodes are not DVD ripped, even though this series is now available on DVD. Instead, someone recorded choppy television rips, so the episodes play more like very old VHS tapes."
