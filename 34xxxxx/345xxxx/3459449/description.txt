These are 4 concerts of the best band ever  - The Stone Roses. The are live at Spike Island 1990, Manchester, Leicester and Felle Festival in Irelend all in 1995. The Quality is not brillant because these are bootlegs. If your a fan then it is worth the download. I have loads more including some Ian Brown and John Squire solo concerts and if this prove popular then i upload more. 

hope you enjoy. 

Long live the roses!!!!!!!!!!!!
