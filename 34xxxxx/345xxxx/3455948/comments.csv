,Hei_p책-deg,2006-03-11T09:32Z,good quality? isn't the usual 350MB
,zedman,2006-03-11T09:35Z,"this is the same quality as it's been all season, the reason for the larger filesize is that the episode is almost 67 minutes long"
,Arklite,2006-03-11T13:22Z,"Gotta love it! Thanks, good show as always! :)"
,kermit the frog,2006-03-11T14:03Z,"How many episodes is season 2? Season 1 was ""only"" 12 I think, plus the pilot movie (almost like 3-4 episodes). Does anyone know?
Otherwise thank you for uploading this! Thank You!"

,truemmer,2006-03-11T17:47Z,"Sound is awful.
Again. Like the orenji release of ep19.
Like a copy of a copy of a videotape.
Hoping for a better release.
