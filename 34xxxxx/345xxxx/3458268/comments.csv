,PsychopathicMetal08,2008-05-03T20:51Z,"once u got 100% you gotta open it in winRAR, and extract the files.... then you'll get all the songs and be able to play them.... also the fact you didnt know that means its probably a bad idea for you to be downloading torrents if you dont know what to do with the files your downloading"
,cronicclapper,2008-09-20T19:01Z,HAHAHA you bought it twice.  This CD must do that to people.  I've bought it twice also.
