I've seen these guys live on the Efes blues fest in Moscow a couple of years ago.... they were a blast! Gotta say that this is a bloody great band and if you haven't heard of them then you've missed a lot! If you like blues, swing, jive, bebop, cool guitar and harmonicas download this... you won't regret it!

A bit about the Cats:
It's been over 30 years since world-class musicians guitarist Little Charlie Baty and harmonicist/vocalist/songwriter Rick Estrin first teamed up and took hard Chicago blues, jump, Texas swing and jazz and mixed it with rockabilly, proto-rock'n'roll, jumping jive, bebop and Estrin's sharply original lyrics, creating a sound one critic described as "Charlie Christian playing in Little Walter's band." Their utter mastery of American roots music is fueled by Baty's jaw-dropping guitar acrobatics and driven by Estrin's captivating original songs, cutting vocals and brilliant harmonica playing.
