[V],boze,2006-03-15T22:33Z,"It is NOT the complete Final Cut Studio. There are more discs that are not here. It asks for ""Apple Loops for Soundtrack Pro"" and will later ask for the soundtrack pro disc.

Please upload the rest of the discs."
,linkdup,2006-03-19T18:36Z,"boze, are those optional disks?"
[V],boze,2006-03-21T19:57Z,"I really don't know as I've never held the original application in my hands. But I do know what Apple's site sais and Soundtrack Pro is part of ""Final Cut Studio"" (http://store.apple.com/1-800-MY-APPLE/WebObjects/AppleStore?productLearnMore=M9911Z/A). But you can ofcause buy just Final Cut Pro 5 separatly. I'm guessing that they are using the same discs and only slapping the extra Soundtrack and Motion discs into the ""Studio"".

Anyways. ""Final Cut Studio Complete"" should contain all applications and would probably be around 2-3 full DVD9s"
,smokeonit,2006-03-30T09:21Z,the final cut studio complete is more or less 20GB. so there's a lot missing. it would ne nice if someone uploaded the universal binary package released today... thnx
,jonasfr,2006-04-02T12:58Z,"I've downloaded this and it runs, if you download motion and the other things separetly and install it, it will not ask for a serial nr, because you've entered a final cut studio nr, which is for the hole suite, so just download the other progs"
,Fargcumecha,2006-04-22T09:29Z,FCP 5.1 Universal now seeding - http://thepiratebay.org/details.php?id=3474155
,LeZombi,2006-05-15T05:16Z,I had problems with serial numbers but solved my problem. If you have have the final cut studio.dmg file all you have to do is install final cut again with soundtrack pro checked with apple loops unchecked and you don't have to have a serial. It uses the one from your final cut pro application which is D-343-CLH-206-QGO-350-IQL-134-RXN-STP
,Thangsang007,2006-06-05T13:17Z,"Hey folks,

,Neotronic,2006-06-29T14:32Z,"I can't get the file to worm... I tried Daemon tools first, but when I tried to open the CD it gave an error message.

I tried to use ISObuster, but I don't have the full version so I can't run the installation file from there either.

Can someone help me?"
,JWok456,2006-07-05T05:21Z,Does anyone have a serial number for DVD pro 3?  I can't get Final Cut to work without it.  Thanks in advance.
,flukeskydiver,2006-08-16T18:42Z,could someone reseed?
,gnochimusic,2006-09-20T14:43Z,"I downloaded Final Cut Studio 5.1 (Universal Binary), Final Cut Pro 5.dmg and went to Macserialz.org and cannot figure out which S/N to use.  I've be going crazy for days.
Can anyone help?  Thanks"
,romhai,2006-11-18T21:07Z,"It took me sooooo LONG to find the serial numbers for this. I am posting them so no one has to go through killign themselves for it like me! ALso if you have problems installing it because it asks you for additional discs, make sure you install it with only final cut pro checked.

,bankstarr,2007-01-12T19:20Z,"downloaded and everything ok.. took like a week..  but ive been trying to install and no avail.  the continue button is un-clickable after entering any serial i find.. including the Final Cut Studio S/N thats been said to have worked for pretty much everyone..  anyone know wassup?

thanks!  - will continue to seed for everyone else ;)"
,jchief4040,2007-01-31T04:12Z,romhai is full of SHIT .. no S/N has worked so far!! 
,Simbad54,2007-03-11T12:48Z,"Ok, romhai is NOT full of shit, he just typed it down wrong, so here are the serials correctly, basically WITHOUT the forward slashes at the end.

Final Cut Studio: D-343-CLH-206-QGO-350-IQL-134-RXN-STP

A message pops up saying ""this is an upgrade serial, please enter your original FCP serial..."" etc

Then: DVD SP3: C-342-SQZ-170-EAZ-340-AKZ-170-RMQ-PDY

FCP HD c-341-jej-170-wfu-341-vkv-170-rsz-pdn

Motion: C-340-YFL-170-JST-340-WKJ-170-RRY-QVW

BUT, as far as i can tell the first SN above is an UPGRADE SN, in otherwords you already need FCP 4.5. I basically started from Vers 4.0 and upgraded down the line, to 4.5 & now Studio 5. The above SN worked perfectly. Now i just need the other discs..."
,dboy13,2007-04-02T14:54Z,"Ok, all the serials work, but it says I need the disc ""DVD Studio 4""  and I cant get around it...   What is the best way about getting this? should I get 4.5? or is there a way to bypass needing that disc? SOMEONE HELP, How did u guys get it to work???"
,turusov,2007-06-20T13:41Z,"SO WHAT ABOUT ADDITIONAL  DISCS THAT IT ASKS TO INSERT WHILE INSTALLING?
S/N IS OK, BUT DISCS... ;(
PLEASE HELP!
THNX :)"
,nat0822,2007-08-25T13:58Z,"Thanks. Had some problems, but comments really helped."
,arteb182,2007-09-07T13:14Z,"It doesn't work.
It needs the Soundtrack Pro DVD to be installed."
,ahpotty,2007-09-26T20:59Z,"excellent...everything up and running ok thanks to comments and help from previous torrenters.  

Im new to this.  When do I stop uploading?  Dont want to be leech.  Country living is just great except small broadband width.  "
,grasueuk,2007-10-09T00:23Z,This torrent is fantastic. It has more editing facilities than I'll ever need. Many thanks...... highly recommended. On instalation just tick the Final Cut Pro box only.
,dd-mann,2007-12-29T16:53Z,Will this work on a MacBook intel??
,natali004,2008-01-11T09:38Z,PLEASE SEED!!! 
,puzzelo,2008-02-14T20:17Z,"Only works with FCP ticked unless you have the discs or maybe you have some components already installed. 

thanks for this sight. I spent a fortune on original software only to discover missing components or other hidden hardware requirements or just too buggy.NO MORE! First I want to try then if I use it a lot I'll buy it."
,puzzelo,2008-02-14T20:19Z,I could use the full FCP pack. It would be nice if there were MD5 sum checks so we could all check the integrity of the DL. ;) and...
,puzzelo,2008-02-14T20:21Z,It installed fine on MBpro intel. Tried all the other optional installs but always requires the discs. Anybody got the rest?
,Canti-Sama,2008-02-16T18:03Z,"Me too, im happy i got FCP but i also dowloaded motion and it was only the motion content, so i really need to install the motion app"
,aquakid,2008-02-25T04:40Z,This is for Power PC not intel macs. Thanks anyway.
,chkc,2008-02-29T21:34Z,This works! hightly recommended! Thanks so much for wall posts - they really helped. Thank you!

Thanks!"
,skainhisears,2008-06-07T22:27Z,"Is there a serial for this included in the torrent that i just can't find, or am i going to have to go download a keygen from another site?"
,mobrien1234567,2008-06-17T23:44Z,I just successfully installed thank u so much and thanks for the comments and serials romhai and sinbad.

,rast4man,2008-12-16T10:43Z,"The serials work fine. Although, once installed the program crashes for me on my Kalyway 10.5.2/10.5.5 setup. I also tried to install the patch for the 6.04 and it said it ""wasn't needed."" Hrmm

Regardless, thanks for the upload."

,Arabian_Knight,2009-01-13T13:52Z,How I look at it is that the least we can do is seed and give our feedback. I mean dag people this is big league software for free!!!
,508cell,2009-06-08T06:53Z,can this work for windows xp?
,raycat24,2009-07-18T05:26Z,"i just wanna say thanks so much for the upload, i downloaded the torrent and used simbad's serials and everything worked out perfectly!! thanks to the uploader and thanks to simbad!!"
,clairebresterx,2009-08-08T09:17Z,"I also cannot install without it asking for extra disks. 
Request is not optional if you want to include Motion, Livetype etc. If this is not FULL package it should not be labeled Final Cut STUDIO complete. If it is not for Intel Macs, it should not be under Applications>Mac"
,feedme,2010-01-07T23:52Z,"Hi, Could someone confirm this is for intel processor? thx"
,feedme,2010-01-08T14:16Z,"It wouldn't install because of hardware requirements on new Macbook Pro, I think it's because it has an intel processor and this is for power ones... If anyone knows of a FCP torrent for intel processor mac the info would be appreciated, this is the second I've tried.
Thanks"
