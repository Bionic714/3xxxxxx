Softspace, an electronica artist from England, debuted on Musictrade in November 2005 on the Requiems for a Submerged City compilation (MT005). This is his first full length release on the label, presenting his beautiful and rich synth soundscapes in the form of 11 new songs.

Softspace has been playing synths for almost 3 decades. His early influences were artists like Wendy Carlos, Tangerine Dream, Kraftwerk; lately he has enjoyed ambient/electronica artists like Biosphere and Tetsu Inoue.

"This album is really driven by the energy of sound", characterizes Softspace. "I've been fascinated by the ability of sound to affect our emotions, and with the synthesizer the sound palette available to the artist has really exploded. Each track on this album is unique in emotion, yet part of the larger soundscape. To put a rough label on it, the music is in the vein of experimental minimalist tradition, primarily based on keyboard improvisations subjected to further electronic production. Main keyboard instruments used were Access Virus, Novation and Roland V."
