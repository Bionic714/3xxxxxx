,SweetNucca,2006-03-14T13:15Z,"Thanks for the upload.  Smith's presentation doesn't really add anything to the available material on HAARP. He seems a bit like just another bandwagon jumper trying to sell a book. He's also pretty boring and inarticulate in his delivery. But hey, at least he's not Phil Schneider... :D :D"
,ReVIsed,2006-03-14T16:36Z,SweetNucca: Do you have any material about Phil Schneider which debunks his theories? I mean without a shadow of a doubt. Because some of the things he say (like the construction of internment camps) are verified and true. Without a shadow of a doubt.
,SweetNucca,2006-03-14T17:23Z,"What I can tell you about Phil Schneider is that all of the info, that is verifiable, that he used in his ""lectures"" was available from other sources before he arrived on the scene. Schneider was a really pathetic character that took some known conspiracies and mixed them with a giant dose of his own fantasies. I really felt sorry for the guy."
,SweetNucca,2006-03-14T17:27Z,The privately run internment camps/prisons were pretty well known by the time Bill Cooper hit the scene and that predated Schneider by several years.
