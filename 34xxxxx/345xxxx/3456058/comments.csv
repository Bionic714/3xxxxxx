,splintereye,2006-05-19T18:18Z,"can anyone upload ""the fear you wont fall""? i think its a singel."
,Raideraid,2006-07-17T18:31Z,"Piratebay is the worst place to download music, you can't find shit, why don't you use Oink or something. Anyway Joshua Radin is awsome, I have two ep's one single and this album. the best song is his cover of the cure's ""girlfriend in a coma"""
,jester77,2006-09-16T08:32Z,"That's pretty funny, Raideraid... I've found a lot of useful stuff on Pirate Bay.  If you hate it so much, what are you doing here?

And by the way, ""Girlfriend in a Coma"" was by The Smiths, off the ""Strangeways, Here I Come"" album, NOT by The Cure.  Have a nice day.

Thanks, armis, for uploading this torrent!"
