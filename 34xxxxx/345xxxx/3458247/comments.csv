,digdug22,2006-07-01T15:48Z,Appreciate this torrent very much !!
,lakitu,2006-08-15T06:41Z,"thru feedback i have learned two things you might want to know. 

first, if you are on a mac, you will not have an english version of Wittgenstein's Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus, due to an error on my part. (to satisfy your curiousity, both the files named ""Wittgenstein, Ludwig - Tractatus logico-philosophicus"" are actually spanish, but the .ISO collection of all his writing should contain it; win users can install the .ISO, but mac users cannot.) so if you are on a macintosh, or just want an individual copy of the Tractatus, download it from here: www.goodreads.ca/tractatus.pdf . it's the only .PDF version on the web i've found, so/but it might not be there long. 

the second thing is, i omitted some books that shouldn't've been omitted; one of them is George Boole's The Laws of Thought, which, thanks to mpwd on undernet, i have been made is aware is here: http://www.gutenberg.org/files/15114/15114-pdf.pdf. if you notice others missing, please put up URLs to them on this page. 

i made sure both of these are .PDFs, due to the notation involved in each. if someone finds a copy of the Tractatus in a more notation-preserving format, please just post the URL here. thanks 

otherwise, as a final note, i added my nickname (lakitu) to the collection not so i would get (in)famous, but to distinguish the collection, so it would be more easily identifiable; 52 or 96 ""philosophy ebook collections"" all start to look the same otherwise. oh well. 

have a philosophical day. "

I start university next year and I'm leaning towards philosophy at the moment, so this could give me a headstart. ;)
