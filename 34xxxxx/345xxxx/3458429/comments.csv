,Glenruben,2006-03-19T01:47Z,How the flying FUCK did this make it to the top 100 list with no seeders and no downloads? Is that list totally ramdom?!

[V],oblodo,2006-03-19T17:17Z,"Just a little warning.. its a 4:3 AR copy, and only stereo sound. But nice quality if you only want to watch it on a ordinary tv. Hope someone rips the 16x9 wide DVD soon ;)"
[V],oblodo,2006-03-19T17:19Z,"Ignore me... this IS the 16x9, my bad... ;)"
