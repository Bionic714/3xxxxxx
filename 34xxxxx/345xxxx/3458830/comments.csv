,Silk,2006-03-18T09:51Z,"Why is there a remove ""Windows Genuine Advantage""... if it is a corp ed ?
No activation in the corp ed."
,georgeandkristy,2006-03-18T12:45Z,"This Is OEM w/o SP1 or SP2 ; during the update process, Windows Genuine Advantage will be installed ; M$ recently removed the ability to 'turn off' this anti-piracy measure. To download updates after 'advantage' is installed there is one simple step. 1. place 'javascript:void(window.g_sDisableWGACheck='all')' in the address bar and press the 'enter' key. then select custom or express. you now have access to any updates you wish!"
,pokersucs,2006-03-20T00:07Z,You don't need a script to remove windows Genuine Advantage. Just click on your IE>Tools>Internet Options>Programs>Manage Ad-Ons>WGA  Highlight and disable. 
,pokersucs,2006-03-20T00:09Z,I'm assuming by Corporate edition he means XP Professional
,georgeandkristy,2006-03-21T13:20Z,windows update now prevents the ability to disable windows advantage. the javascript listed above will allow you to continue to update windows.
