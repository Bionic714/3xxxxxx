 As release upon release emerges, we will continue to bring you only  :::::.
 the best in electronic music! We focus equally on both style and     ::::::
 quality, and if your reading our info, you already know that. We're  ::::::
 now in our fifth year, and we feel pretty confident about the work   ::::::
 we do. We have brought music to the masses, and in doing so          ::::::
 hopefully made their lives that much better. For us, that is what    ::::::
 its all about, and thats what keeps us going.                        ::::::
                                                                      ::::::
 We purchase records and rip them so other people can hear the tracks ::::::
 and decide if they want to buy! We have paid for our records and     ::::::
 think you should also, if you do not subscribe to this, you are part ::::::
 of the problem.  So if you like a release please buy it. Don't be a  ::::::
 skanky bitch about the price, just pay it! In doing so, you are      ::::::
 supporting what we all love so much. We sleep good at night cause we ::::::
 support the artists that produces electronic music, without whom we  ::::::
 wouldn't have so much material to enjoy.  We know some releases are  ::::::
 nearly impossible to find, so buy something else you like instead :D ::::::
                                                                      ::::::
 The electronic music scene ain't like the pop and rock scene. Where  ::::::
 fans pays Euro100 for a ticket to a concert! It's smaller and        ::::::
 artists rely on units sold.  Since you probably downloaded this      ::::::
 release and think you can have it for free -- you're wrong.  That    ::::::
 mindset is killing the artists and the scene. Its simple, support    ::::::
 the people who support you, musically.                               ::::::
                                                                      ::::::
 We at TechnoRulez are adamant about any of releases being posted in  ::::::
 public scene dupingchans and prechans! Please respect that, and      ::::::
 remove our releases from the db's. We insist that the scene must be  ::::::
 kept underground, and if the clueless lamers using such chans and    ::::::
 websites cant comply with the terms, you will see alot less of us.   ::::::
 That doesn't mean we will slow down, but we will take action to keep ::::::
 our releases internal or a very limited spread.  It is simply        ::::::
 unacceptable to post scene related info on *any* public source at    ::::::
 *any* time.  Use your head.                                          ::::::

 In the words of a Luke Slater track, "Lets get together" and make    ::::::
 the scene a better place for all of us! keep the distance from       ::::::
 the n00bs, and unite more to keep the few bad apples from ruining    ::::::
 our business!                                                        ::::::
