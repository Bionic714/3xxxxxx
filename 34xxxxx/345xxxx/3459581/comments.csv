,ehmeio,2007-07-25T21:38Z,working just fine! i just had some issues when i tried to unrar but i solved just rechecking the torrent. burned at 4x and tested in a matrix infinity
,spacesnot,2008-07-06T14:38Z,"Hi, before I try downloading this I'd like to know how to crack it and how to unrar it correctly, I'd appreciate if somebody told me how do these things. Don't I need a certain patch or such or does it come with the torrent/file that I download here? Thanks in advance for any help provided. :)

Hej, jag skulle vilja veta hur man får spelet i fråga att fungera, hur det ska ska packas upp och om det bara är att bränna när det väl är gjort, eller måste det crackas? Kan alla torrenter till PS2 crackas på samma sätt i så fall?"

,Boca12GTR,2010-05-30T10:03Z,"Okay It work 100% with me, I extracted the files with WinRar, patched it for ESR (I use MementoFW_11 to patch google it) then burned it wit dvd decrypter speed 1x. DVD-r.

On PS2 FAT its awesome still havent tried a Slim but I'm sure it will work fine.

if your games plays in light black or black n'grey(white) modded or not you may have to covert this ISO to PAL or whatever region your from.

Not all games are like that, For ex. Kingdom Hearts 2 final mix only patched worked fine on my USA PS2, but another Fifa street 2 I downloaded which was a PAL did not work patched for ESR or Swap Magic. 

Thanks again for the upload will seed"
,man0cels0,2010-10-02T23:04Z,"doesn't freaking work, I've tried at least 5 or 6 burns from diferent torrents and places. The only that worked was a pal thas displays in black and white....while the right one ntsc goes to the such blank freaking screen...."
,dons20,2011-05-02T00:33Z,"EVERYONE WHO HAS PROBLEMS BURNING READ THIS. To Burn it, You have to patch it first. Patch it with ESR Disk Patcher. Just google it and u'll have no problem at all. It has an easy GUI so u can understand it easily. WHEN BURNING BURN AT 4X!!!"
,divinelykeyed,2012-02-03T15:59Z,why do i hav to patch it if my ps2 is ntsc-u and the game is alredy ntsc-u??
,Ps2Games12,2012-06-29T14:46Z,"1st You must extract files , then burn it with alcohol 120% - 4x speed! Works great , thanks uploader! :)"
