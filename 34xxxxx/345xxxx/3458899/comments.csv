,crystaltears83,2007-12-29T17:46Z,"Hi all. I downloaded Tycoon City from about five or six different places... Every time I try to run the setup after mounting the .cue file... I get this error message:

Setup has experienced an error.

Please do the following:
- Close any running programs
- Empty your temporary folder
- Check your Internet Connection (Internet-based Setups)

Then try to run the Setup again.

Error code: -6001


But I have an active internet connection. I've emptied the temp folder and the only running program (even in the start menu) is magicISO and the Install Wizard.

Any help?"

,TheGoIsWin,2008-03-01T07:07Z,"Hey Crystaltears, Try this:

This InstallShield error indicates a corrupt version of InstallShield is installed on your computer. To correct this issue, simply delete the following folder from your computer and attempt to run the installer again:

 C:\Program Files\Common Files\InstallShield\Professional\RunTime\0701

If this fails to correct the problem, we recommend you RENAME (not delete) the entire  C:\Program Files\Common Files\InstallShield\ folder and try again. You may rename the folder to anything you like, but we recommend something similar to 'InstallShield-old'. "
