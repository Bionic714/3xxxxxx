,tenofzero,2006-02-28T02:13Z,"thanks for this :-) I'll grab it when I get home, but I have been looking forward to a 64bit torrent."
,RanShak,2006-02-28T19:52Z,What exactly is this? I'm not sure if this is what I'm looking for..
,connman,2006-02-28T20:08Z,@RanShak this appears to be the 64-bit version of the Windows Vista February CTP (also known as build 5308). So if you have a 64-bit processor (if you don't know you probably don't) then you can install and run it. I'm gonna download and try this out later...
,N4R,2006-03-01T03:51Z,"Wow. I installed this 64-bit version yesterday, and found i could barely run my computer at all! I thought it would at least be faster than the 32-bit, but i found the 64 to run at maybe 1/4 the speed. Not to mention it comes with GARBAGE 64-bit drivers on the dvd, if you plan on using wireless internet you might as well give up now. Hopefully this will save some of you a lot of pain and time, go for the 32bit!!!"
,delpieric,2006-03-01T14:08Z,"N4R: You probably haven't got a fast enough processor, or enough RAM."
,bondk,2006-03-02T21:31Z,is this full Version or wht????? PLz hlp
,jh3si,2006-03-03T08:54Z,"Not as in, this is thier final release that is done to the fullest extent and there will be no changes, some sites project the final versions of vista to be released around Dec. 1st."
,Debender,2006-03-04T14:34Z,can i upgrade my 32bit xp into this 64bit vista? or do i have to do a clean install?
,Tanguero,2006-03-04T17:21Z,Where can I get the german language file (language pack) for this 64 bit-Version ??
[V],VilleR2,2006-03-05T09:39Z,Can anyone tell me the difference between this version and the 64-bit version? plz send a pm! kan någon säga vad det är för skillnad på den här och 64-bitversionen? snälla skicka ett pm!
[V],VilleR2,2006-03-05T09:40Z,Can anyone tell me the difference between this version and the 32-bit version? plz send a pm! kan någon säga vad det är för skillnad på den här och 32-bitversionen? snälla skicka ett pm!
,Ghuntax,2006-03-05T10:59Z,Is this the final version???
,bcode,2006-03-06T11:24Z,"Ok, let recap one more time for the slow ones.

This is still beta software, it is NOT the final release of Windows Vista.

This is EXACTLY the same as the 32bit counter-part EXCEPT it will only run on 64bit proc.  If you don't know what that means, get the 32bit version to be safe(which will run on either 64 or 32bit proc).

,Widukind,2006-03-07T09:15Z,"Is this worth installing? Have read in other ""vista"" torrents that there are many problems with programs that dont work with vista and also problems with activation?"
[V],skaning,2006-03-07T16:09Z,I've got the same problem as N4R. And my computer is´nt slow. It's AMD 64 4400+ 2gb DDR and 7800 GTX. So there most be another problem!
,jsolo,2006-03-10T17:30Z,"so, i've burned the file onto a dvd but it won't set up.
when i click the disc i get E:/ is not a valid Win32 application.
clicking setup.exe on the disc also yields the same result, but with setup.exe added to the message."
,davanata,2006-03-10T19:23Z,"Seriously, like everyone is saying this is ""64 bit"" unless you are running in a 64 bit enviroment the setup.exe is not 32 bit.  How about try booting off the dvd that you just made ;)

Does the 32bit cdkey work for this one?"
,jsolo,2006-03-11T16:23Z,"hehe..yarr, i guess that's what the 32 in Win32 means, never thought about it...was trying to install over coffee before work.
heh, it's just not something i'm used to thinking about when installing a new windows os.

hehe, i feel so....not smart. "
,Soul_Master2,2006-03-11T22:32Z,"I'd stay away from this for now,  unless you know you can find x64 drivers for your sound, etc"
,morgen,2006-03-13T16:26Z,dont  work on sata hard drivers  
,almalexia,2006-03-17T08:40Z,"so i really want to try this version
i have an nvidia-amd basedmotherboard so drivers will not be a problem at all.
But i have 3 questions so please could you answer them???
1) can i install this on a sata hd????
2) where can i get a seria to install this version
3) how much time can i have vista installed??
is there a crack for it??????"
,raleighton,2006-03-18T12:16Z,"Just incase you didnt already know, Vista will use USB flash memory as a top up to your RAM...  If your gonna use this i would really suggest you try and get hold of the developer confrences.  There quite informative on the sort of performance you should expect, and the little extras!"
[V],MrBert,2006-03-20T13:01Z,"first off it will work with sata, 2ndly you NEED 64BIT hardware. if you dont have this, go away and download 32bit. IF you are unsure if you have 64bit hardware, you most probably have 32bit.  IF you Are UNsure. dont bother downloading anything.remember this is still a BETA so there will be problems.    im not gona install this til i get it on volume licsense. had enuff trouble with xp x64.(well i lie, had troule installing 32bit on 64 bit hardware without realising.)"
,Tvindkind,2006-03-20T22:44Z,Hej jeg vil lige hoere hvordan aktivere man denne version findes der en crack men ellers synes det her en god version os vis der er mange ting der skal laves i nu i denne windows version

,almalexia,2006-03-23T01:25Z,"i have 64bit hardware what i really need to know is how much time can i have the os installed on my pc?????
