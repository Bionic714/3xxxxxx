BMW Mark IV v27 upgrade.


- Burn the disk using a high quality CD-R disk at the lowest possible burning speed using these steps:
1. click on "image burning wizard" then click "browse" and find the folder that you extracted the two files to.
2. click on "bmw v27" (there's only one to choose) and click "open" it.
3. Under Image file information, it should list the two files. Click "Next"
4. If you didn't insert a high quality CD-R earlier, insert it and set the write speed at the slowest one (mine was 4x). Make sure the CD/DVD Recorder is set on the right drive.
5. Click "Start" and it should start burning. Once it reaches 100%, it'll be done and the disc will eject on its own. 
- Once the disk is ready, follow these steps
1. Go to your vehicle and turn the ignition switch to the first position. Let the navigation system boot up and get into a normal operating mode.
2. Leaving the system on (never turn the power off during these steps!!), go back and eject the navigation CD from your drive unit.
3. Put in the V27 disk you created into your drive unit. Watch your screen and be patient. It says it will take about 6 minutes to do the upgrade, but it doesn't take that long. When it?s done it will eject the CD automatically. 
4. Put your navigation CD back in the drive and make sure everything is working properly.
