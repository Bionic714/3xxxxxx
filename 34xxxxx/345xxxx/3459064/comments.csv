,155bpmikey,2007-10-28T12:43Z,"For 10.4.x Install Dvds:


1) Use partition magic or other partition software such as Acronis's suite or another partitioning program to resize a PRIMARY partition so that you have at least 10 Gigs of unallocated space. Then create a 10 gig PRIMARY fat32 partition.
2)Put in your installation dvd. Reboot you computer.
3) Go into the utilities menu at the top of your screen once you have booted off of the DVD and go into the disk utility, (wait a few seconds or up to a minute for it to load)
4) Take the fat32 partition you just created and format it as mac os extended.
5) Exit the disk utillity
6) Hit next and agree with the license agreement.
7) Customise your installation.
8) If you have an intel computer select the intel packages and if you have an AMD computer select the AMD packages.
9) Go through the other packages and if you have any of the mentioned hardware select the packages as this will save you time later. (note: if you have troubles with the installation or it doesnt complete or doesnt boot after it has been installed try deselecting these packages on the next try)
10) Once having selected your packages click install.
11) It will pop up with somthing about scanning your dvd for errors and you can just hit skip to save time.
9) Reboot once the installation completes and pray to dog that you did it right."
