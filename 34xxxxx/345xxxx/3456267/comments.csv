Avisynth is a frameserver, which allows editing movies without toggle convert.
It can increase, decrease, cropping and also remove logos.
You'll find more detail information at

,K4210,2006-05-21T23:08Z,"Virtual Dub Mod & TMPGen

Not have to test the best config by hand, there's Virtual Dub Mod and TMPGen.
They are able to show you the amount of the frames, those e.g. which you want to cut.

Also where the logo, you want to take out, is located and how much pixel are accrued while cropping.

Both Apps are also able to convert, whereas TMPGen work really slow.
The Registration is through Registry-Entry implemented and will execute while you setup."
,K4210,2006-05-21T23:08Z,"CCE

The Cinema Craft Encoder (CEE) is the fastest and best encoder, because it is written in machinelanguage.
When converting cennected with Avisynth, the CCE is unbeatable, for converting at least in realtime. (Based on your computing power)
