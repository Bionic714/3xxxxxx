,goldanthrowolf,2006-07-11T03:18Z,"Dudes.. *double thumbs up!*

I lost my collection a while ago, and this is awesome!  And, with the new secret upgrades, etc, that'll be sweet :D

I really wish game companies would re-release alot of this old shit, but their too huffy and stuffy about the 'latest and the greatest' to bother with the classics."
,Zamzummin,2006-07-25T10:39Z,"goldanthrowolf, SNK Playmore is re-releasing many of their Neo Geo fighting games on the PS2. This includes KOF '94 Re-Bout, KOF Orochi Collection ('95, '96, '97), KOF NEST Collection ('99, 2000, 2001), Art of Fighting Collection, Fatal Fury Battle Archive 1, Last Blade 2-in-1, etc. They all have online play which is really cool, but only for Japan so if you import these games you won't have online play.

But the 'latest and greatest' sometimes does mean the best, King of Fighters XI and Samurai Shodown 6 are the best in the series. :)"

,lakhdar,2006-08-13T14:29Z,khachkoom
,frogz,2006-08-14T04:55Z,"Hey does any one know if I can use these roms on NeoRAGExp 0.8c or NeoRAGEx 0.8 or do they just work on 5.0. By the was is this a new version cause the latest one I heard of was NeoRAGEx 0.9 If anyone has tried this or knows the answer to these question I would apreciate it a lot.
Thank You very much"
,Zamzummin,2006-08-18T22:58Z,"frogz:
I am sure the ROMs do work on NeoRAGEx 0.8 and 0.9, but they are old versions with less features and a much smaller games list. Since the games list is smaller, any games that it doesn't recognize it will just place at the end of the list usually in all capital letters with an incorrect filename, which looks very sloppy."

,hack206,2006-09-01T20:06Z,How do you insert coins please can someone help me. my email address is ecosse_206@hotmail.com
,Zamzummin,2006-09-05T08:03Z,"First, make sure it is set to arcade mode. Go to Machine Settings to switch between arcade and console modes. Then, if you are using a keyboard press '3' to insert a coin, or '4' to insert multiple coins. If you are using a joypad, you can set the Coin button yourself through Controls, Joystick Setup.

I don't recommend using a keyboard for these games, so if that's all you have, make your life easier and get a controller."

,Maccam16,2008-06-18T20:44Z,"This is a great torrent, but to all people looking for authentic Neo Geo roms you have to dl the MAME roms. These roms all have minor discrepancies between them and the real versions especially the ""special"" (hacked) versions. NeoRAGE is good for creating art however, as you can turn off individual parts of the visuals and take snapshots, something MAME cannot do.

But yeah, the Neo community generally admits NeoRAGE to be the inferior emulator, especially because of it having it's own (wrong) roms. If you like the games, go get the Mame versions for 100% arcade accuracy."
,Zamzummin,2008-09-04T08:52Z,"It's true that MAME is a purist's arcade emulator and the ROM images it uses are clean and correct; however, when I uploaded this torrent I envisioned a more casual player who just wanted to enjoy Neo Geo games and not other arcades like CPS-1, CPS-2 or worry about the accuracy of the emulation. For this, I believe NeoRAGEx is a lot more simple and straightforward to use than MAME, especially when it comes to understanding the MAME naming conventions and the difference between parent and clone ROM sets."

Anyway, the reason I'm here is to tell people that after 3 years, there is a new update to NeoRAGEx by the same team that brought you this version. It includes more features and an updated ROM set. Read it here: http://www.snk-neofighters.com/modules/news/article.php?storyid=529 (scroll half way down for the English version). I'm not going to make a new torrent, since all of the download links are there (full ROM set, preview set, new background skins). I just wanted to inform all the happy customers of this torrent that there is a new version to download at your leisure. If anyone needs help with the new version, make a comment and I will respond."

Hopefully you understand me here... because I guess I downloaded it from the site but there is no application so I guess its just an update patch of sorts they made, I already downloaded they're updated full rom set though but I need the updated emulator of neoragex itself... help me out someone."

,Zamzummin,2010-06-22T08:46Z,"@meksiccan

There are plenty of seeders and leechers so you should be able to get 100% with no problem. Maybe try a different bittorrent client like uTorrent or Vuze."

,Zamzummin,2010-07-09T23:23Z,"@red33mnnYou have to press \'3\' on the top row of the keyboard, not on the numpad. If it\'s still not working for you, change the input settings to make Insert Coin a different key."

,Zamzumin,2012-06-01T07:01Z,"@paradigm76

You need to play on Arcade mode to add coins. If you're playing on Console mode, you only get a limited number of continues."
