Plus, Super Plus, etc. versions of games are just the same games with hidden characters unlocked or extra features. For example, SNK vs. Capcom Super Plus has characters like Violent Ken and Shin Akuma selectable and Metal Slug 5 Plus lets you switch between any weapons.

This set also has every ROM updated with all the latest CRCs. For example, the old version of Garou: Mark of the Wolves didn't let you use any super moves with Gato (that's why everyone thinks he sucks, haha), but the updated version fixes it.

Preview thumbnails are also included for every game, so you can see each game's title screen within the emulator.

This is the ultimate set for the ultimate Neo-Geo ROM collector!
