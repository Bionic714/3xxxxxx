,david1,2006-03-12T12:56Z,I bet Porkster is a closet case :)
,Porkster,2006-03-12T13:51Z,closet case?  it's either a fact or not.  Homosexuality is a mental disorder.  I can't seen any proof to say otherwise.
,adamgillis,2006-03-12T19:20Z,"I would love to know what stats you are basing your claims on. In north america homosexuality was striken from the list of mental disorders over 20 years ago, rightfully so. "

,simbi,2006-03-15T18:14Z,"Porkster is evidently not a very bright person, I can't see any proof to say otherwise."
,refrakt,2006-03-23T15:00Z,"Fuck you porkster, do you have nothing better to do than post homophobic comments and promote anti-social behaviour? 

Mental Disorder? I think not love, go take that attitude and go back to whatever fucked up country/parents that created you.
