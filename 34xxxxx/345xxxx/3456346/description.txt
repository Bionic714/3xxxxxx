The theme for this year's 29th parade was "I Believe" with various sections of the parade demonstrating belief in all aspects of Queer culture and sub-culture. One float, that grabbed the crowd's attention was the Brokeback Mormons, a parody on the US state of Utah banning the movie Brokeback Mountain.
