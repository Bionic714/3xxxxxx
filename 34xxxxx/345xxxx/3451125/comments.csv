,joakimar,2006-03-01T09:02Z,I love this game. But where is the Complete release?
,anotherghost,2006-03-02T16:14Z,"I love this game too.  I can't wait, Civilization 4 comes out for mac on July 1st, I think.

Do you know if the expansions work on mac?"
,nnnggg666,2006-03-04T21:27Z,"how do you get around the ""insert civilization 3 CD or quit"" message??? this file seems worthless if you dont have the CD, and im sure people downloading it dont have the CD.  am i missing something?  sorry im a noob at this"
,joakimar,2006-03-05T12:02Z,"The PC expansions will not work. There is a Mac release encompassing them all ? it's called ""Complete"" and it's been out for a month or two. That's what I'm looking for."
,joakimar,2006-03-05T12:02Z,"Oh and there is no question mark in my comment... that's just TPB not handling UTF8 characters, like the longer hyphen."
,el_klotus,2006-03-05T22:17Z,plz seed atleas a few hours ppl! 
,el_klotus,2006-03-06T15:24Z,"cmon, plz seed ppl. its not that hard..."
,sampsa11,2006-03-09T18:22Z,"Hi. Could someone help me out. IÂ´m a new mac-user and I have no idea where to find a program to download torrents. Or how to use it...

So, if you have time and will help me out??  "
,robert-s,2006-03-12T14:45Z,"Hello sampsa. You first need to download a bittorrent client, I would recommend azureus (http://azureus.sf.net). Then download the torrent file for whatever you want to download (Civilization, in this case...). Launch azureus and tell it open the .torrent file, after that, you should be good to go.

As for anyone wondering how to get around the insert CD thing, you could try mounting the disk image with Toast first, that always works for me. If you don't have toast...well I'm sure you'll find a torrent for it on here somewhere :)"
,jemloq,2006-03-13T23:01Z,"To work around the ""insert cd"" problem, all you have to do is

open Disk Utility

click on ""New Image""

in the ""Save As"" field type "" Civilization III ""
(no quotes)

for Image Size, select the lowest (or 5MB)

No encryption & it doesn't matter what read/write
choices you make.

Then mount the image, and there you go.

(This works with Tiger, I'm not sure if Panther is the same).

,SuperMarte,2006-03-31T12:05Z,A great torrent. Works like a charm. Thanx benitocammela. But.... can someone tell me where to find the complete version. The one with the expansions? 
,tempobabempo,2006-04-19T07:21Z,"I'm looking for the complete version as well. Someone said it was on torrent spy, but all I find there is the complete version for PC."
,SuperMarte,2006-04-23T20:24Z,"allegedly there was supposed to be a complete version on mininova..... but there wasn't. at least I can't find it. found one... but no one is seeding or leeching. 

any other tips? "
,Joka2006,2006-04-30T21:15Z,Anyone know if this is universal? I've got the macbook pro running on 1.83 ghz intel core duo.
,macster2010,2006-05-28T04:53Z,"and for those noobs   burn this whole thing without mounting the actual dmg file using disk utility,  click burn, and select Civilization 3.dmg  and  if ya have the CD in the drive it will burn...  and be a CD for ya afterwards..."
,macster2010,2006-05-28T04:55Z,please seed this game I want it so BBBAAADDDD
,speaker83,2006-07-29T15:57Z,"Dloaded this a couple of years ago, now I wait for civ IV. It was released a coupe of weeks ago for mac so now I'll see how long it takes for a game to get fixed for the ""public"". :)"

,musological,2006-10-26T02:45Z,"I have a Civ 3 Complete I'm prepared to seed, but I can't crack the No Dvd reliably. All the no dvd torrents seem to be defunct, and I can't find The Blade's krack.  Any suggestions?"
,tommywing,2007-01-04T18:33Z,"Complete version works with the blades crack, but not once you update it, which you have to do or else the game crashes during play with something about Pedial Icons or something, anyone know how to fix this?"
,Neasdown,2007-10-03T17:48Z,"Meh alright ""old-schoolish"" mac game but forever live duke nukem - which i just found the torrent file of!! lol"

,springthing,2010-09-24T01:25Z,"GAME CRASHES ON MY LAPTOP *FIX*.
game launches and then crashes at some point.
Happens to be when I use two fingers on the trackpad. 

simple fix: don't use the trackpad at all. ever. don't even touch it.

other fix: Find the update called Civ 3 complete ""REV A"". Install this manually following the instructions. I don't know of a crack for this. CD needed.
