,kontaktlins,2006-03-15T02:44Z,Thanks for this one! Can you tell me how to split the files if to put them on two 4.8GB dvd's? Which files need to be on both dvd's etc?
,Gpz900R,2006-03-15T11:05Z,"Use a program called cloneDVD2 which is really easy to use. That will help you to split the movie or just cut it down to size, depending on preference."
