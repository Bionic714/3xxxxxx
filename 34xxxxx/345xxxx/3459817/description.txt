SYNOPSIS 
In this sequel to the 1999 cult hit, eight more strangers wake up within a bizarre cube in which every door leads to more cubes just like the last, some of which are equipped to kill. As they explore their strange habitat, the prisoners come to realize that they are now inhabiting a strange dimension where the laws of everyday physics no longer apply. CUBE 2 was directed by Andrzej Sekula, who was the cinematographer on RESERVOIR DOGS, PULP FICTION and AMERICAN PSYCHO.
