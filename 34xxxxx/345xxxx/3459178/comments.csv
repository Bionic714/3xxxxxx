Great Movie, really Good..... love the strong line..great subbing

I d/l it, used Alcohol 120% to burn it because it hand different ISO better. and watched :)..

one problem: if i play it on my pc, powerdvd... the sound is really bad. i don't know if just me
but if i try on cine player by sonic, it plays great? 

hopefully this answers everybody question. and yes i notice only english sub, which okey i guess

,indierockerseattle,2006-09-15T08:11Z,"This isnt even his last matial arts movie, hes doing a movie with jackie chan which will supposedly have a $15 million fight scene in it."
,nathan130,2006-09-17T03:11Z,"i cant understand the dvd menu, how do i turn on english subs?"
,nathan130,2006-09-17T05:51Z,"nm, i just used the subtitle button on my dvd remote.
great rip, it's awesome to have it in north america on dvd before it's even in theatres yet here.
subtitles are a bit amateur though. there are some mispellings and some of the title screens weren't translated. at times it flashes by so fast too you don't get the chance to really read it. i also noticed the english parts weren't subbed into what they were actually saying, it was changed slightly.
either way, thanks for the upload, awesome."
,jodaking,2006-09-18T18:02Z,anyone got these in ENGLISH cause i don't feel like reading for 1 hour or more
,nathan130,2006-09-21T02:58Z,"it just came out in theatres in north america, so english dubs haven't been made for the movie yet so they won't be available anywhere on the net. besides, you'd actually want to watch this movie with dubs? they're so cheesy!"
,nabil112,2006-09-22T09:40Z,seederz plz stuck at 80
