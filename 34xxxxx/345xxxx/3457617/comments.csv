,Lugubrizione,2007-04-02T02:50Z,"I like yer strategy, deb; witholding some of the file to make people share. 

If I promise to keep seeding, will you give us the last 0.1%? :D"
,mrmaverick,2007-04-03T21:06Z,"It took me over a week to DL this, so I will seed at a good speed and for about another week"
,gylgamesh,2009-07-22T04:12Z,PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE SEED THIS TORRENT BEFORE THE PIRATEBAY TRACKER IS TAKEN DOWN!!!
,debenpec,2009-09-06T13:21Z,"Sorry folks, but I lost the original data file, and my efforts to recreate it have failed. While I can create a .iso file, ir seems to -not- match the checksums in the .torrent file.

bummer!

However, I plan to post a *new* torrent soon, would you prefer the .iso again, or a collection of .rar and .par files, or a pure .avi/.dvix rip?

Let me know.
