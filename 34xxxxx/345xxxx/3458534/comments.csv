Your English doesn't seem to be any better.
""Mistakes"" should be written only in small letters - mistakes. And besides, who cares - the most important thing is that the torrent can be found by us users. And obviously it can be found.
But it's easier to pick on other people's mistakes, right? :P

Anyway, thanks for the torrent, Xeno2007. It's appreciated. :)"
