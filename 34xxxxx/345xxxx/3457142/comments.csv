[V],spirit58,2006-03-23T09:48Z,I am stuck at 71.1% Why isn't anybody seeding?
,Cordack,2006-03-27T12:28Z,I've started to DL the remaining files on other p2p networks... Will seed them soon...
[V],derelk,2006-03-28T04:14Z,"WTF.....
If you´re not seeding theres really no point of uploading, and if your having trouble with your ISP, change,.. But seriously no one can believe that you had problems since 16 th mars.. If you´re just dumping it post a note and tell people. It´s not so very polite to leave us dangeling at 71.1 %
No more nIIx for me."
,ZimonDray,2006-03-28T17:02Z,"Cordack u are a lier!

1kbit/sec down
1kbit/sec up

So u are seeding? YEAH right.."
,Cordack,2006-03-28T19:46Z,"ZimonDray >>

As I told I have limited upload.
I'm currently uploading with ~10 kB/s...
I know it's not much, but it's better then nothing...

You are welcome to find the files yourself as I did... 

Sorry for sharing them with you!!!!"
,ZimonDray,2006-03-28T20:26Z,"Cordack, what is ur connection? modem?
Dude u gotta get some higher connection if that is the case, if u are seeding it with modem here on this file, it wont make any progress for us."
,ZimonDray,2006-03-28T23:03Z,"I think u missunderstod me there cordack, that was not a complain, more a cheering to get a higher connection.
So plz stop using bad words..im beeing polite so im expecting that from u too so chill down, u missunderstood me bigtime!"
,Cordack,2006-03-28T23:53Z,"Oki.. Thats ok :)

I would like a faster connection, but they are very expensive here in denmark...."
,ZimonDray,2006-03-29T00:07Z,"Its ok!
Mistakes can happend all the time, the man we are going to be mad at is nIIx !"
,Cordack,2006-03-29T23:16Z,Don't worry... I'm still seeding... 24/7 :)
