,TheOriginalCoda,2007-12-01T20:30Z,"FYI - The first 17 tracks are the actual CD release of 'The world of Jeeves and Wooster', whereas the tracks numbered 18-28 are audio clips ripped mostly from the DVDs by people related to the 'hatsharpening' website."
,dark_light,2008-06-22T21:56Z,"Well, this is very nice. They've asked me to say a few words and whatnot about this World of Jeeves and Wooster stuff. Well, I mean to say, I don't know about world. One's sphere of operations is fairly extensive, of course, stretching as it does from Chuffnell Regis - where my old friend and fellow-Drone Chuffy Chuffnell ekes out an impovrished existance at his venerable Chuffnell Hall - in the west, to Biddleford Castle, Norfolk, in the east. And there's a lot of places in between. Brinkley Court, Market Snodsbury, for instance, where my Aunt Dahlia lives and moves and has her being; and Smattering Hall, which is rather a grand house where my palSir Murgatroyd Sprokett-Sprockett, who used to be Reginald Watson-Watson and just plain mister until events overtook him as they're liable to do in Lower-Smattering-on-the-Wissel... Where was I? Well, then they're Jeeves. It's his world too, of course, and he'd probably write all this down far better than I can, being an incredibly brainy cove with a vocabulary about the size of Egypt. But I'm dashed if I see why he should have all the fun. Egypt and the Sudan, I should have said, now I come to think of it. Jeeves is incredible in the brain-power department. He puts it down to the fact that he eats almost nothign but fish, but I think there's more to it than that. Somaliland, yoo, I shouldn't be surprised. Anyway, that's it, really, Pip pip!
