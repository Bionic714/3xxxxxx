,picketf,2006-03-15T13:50Z,"DUDE you sure have a vivid fantasy about ppls parents, am I right to suspect a disfunctional projection here?  Your releases aren't exactly high quality yo, just for the record, last time I checked KYR releases had higher resolution than any of your caps. - Thanks budakrist for the upload!"
,WWE FOREVER,2006-03-15T16:38Z,how do i get these files to work usually windows media player works but not for this i dont know what i should use...
,picketf,2006-03-15T18:58Z,use winrar http://www.rarlab.com or your favourite decompressor to join the splitt archive which should result in a .avi file that can be played by your media player
,donz0r,2006-03-17T00:51Z,STONECOLD IM YOUR MOMS PIMP NIGGA
,titans1127,2006-03-17T03:39Z,If you had a brain you would know there are few DVD players that play XVID files.  Besides KYR caps from a High Def source so they quality is 100 times better than your crap.
,Henningsen,2006-03-17T18:29Z,"Just got 1 question....

,rawvssd_character,2006-03-17T19:27Z,"^ Ask StoneCold, maybe he already got it because he has told so many times that his cap will own this place.

LOL. Yeah, right..."
,fantaapelsin,2006-03-17T19:33Z,DVD PLAYERS SOLD IN EUROPE SUPPORT XVID. AMERICA SUCKS ASS.
,retardid,2006-03-19T02:22Z,i still want you to die stonecold you fuck face little jew
,titans1127,2006-03-19T17:46Z,fantaapelsin where the fuck do you come up with the conclusion that America sucks ass?  Is it because StoneCold says that we dont have any dvd players that support xvid?  Well hes fuckin wrong and you shouldnt make such stupid comments you fuckin asshole.
