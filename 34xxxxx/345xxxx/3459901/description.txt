Werner Herzog?s Fata Morgana  (mirage)

this is one of my all time favourite films. utterly indescribable, but ill try my best.

This is a truly innocent piece of cinematic creation. 
Originally this film was intended to be a sci-fi film- about earth being unrecognisable as earth and acting as an alien character (see the later films lessons of darkness and wild blue yonder) - but instead of this story Werner Herzog became mesmerized by the desserts magic trick; the mirage. 
Set out as a three part creation story (the first taking inspiration from the Mayan sacred  book ?popul vuh?) Fata Morgan hypnotically fuses a story about the two biggest forces on earth, at their most abstracted and elemental. On the one hand there is nature and on the other there is civilisation, and inbetween there is the mirage.
Fata Morgana.
