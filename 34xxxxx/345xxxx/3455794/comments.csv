Favorite moment: blowing up a caravan with oxy-acetylene in Brainiac pool :D"
,etatauri,2006-03-19T11:55Z,emphasis on MUCH less scientific. it has its moments but can't really compare to mythbusters. are they really inhaling laughing gas in episode 1?
,jingles,2006-09-02T09:38Z,Please seed..
,_-WoK-_,2006-09-16T17:39Z,Season 4 has started but I haven't seen any torrents from that season uploaded anywhere? Is ITMN down forever and why aren't some scene group ripping the episodes? I want to see more brainiac :'(
,weezl,2006-09-18T23:21Z,"etatauri, yes they inhale N2O (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrous_oxide) in one of the eps, don't remember which though. tried it myself once (!) never had that much fun, every little thing a person does/says becomes irresistible to laugh at :D


_-WoK-_, i share your sadness ;( wish i could do anything"
,webrosc,2006-10-27T07:17Z,"i originally saw this before mythbusters, and thought it was great, but now i've seen all of the mythbusters, (some dowloaded off here as us brits get them later).
i now think brainiac is a show for 5 year olds and doesn't really proove anything except the show writers like sex and explosions"
,weezl,2006-12-28T19:46Z,"Good news folks!
Here's the new s04 eps of brainiac:

,sebzapata,2007-04-11T22:26Z,"in the episode where they see if water goes down the plug the opposite direction on the other side of the world. this is wrong, i saw it done on blue peter and they went to the equator and this tourist place thing and this guy had three sinks with water and a small stick in. the one above the water went the opposite way to the one below the equator and interestingly the one on the equator just went straight down. :-)"
,1Damu,2007-04-18T21:25Z,keep on seeding people!
,martinbogo,2007-09-14T10:53Z,"sebzapata, you're so gullible!    It is indeed the shape of the sink and nothing else that contributes to the clockwise or counterclockwise drain action.   

Braniac is -not- about science.  It's about the ABUSE of science .. quite the opposite of Mythbusters, and it's all done for show.  That said, it's a lot of fun to watch.

,SyntraFTW,2008-01-20T08:28Z,"Epic Show. Has Richard Hammond from Top Gear. More entertaining than Mythbusters, but not as...  in depth."
,rocker9455,2008-02-19T19:05Z,"i dont want you to feel as if i am complaining but whats up with the sound quality its awful or is it just my codec cause i just installed the lastest codecs (xvid, divx and k-lite codec pack) and it doesnt seem to change anything any ideas"
,Volvojunior,2008-05-30T23:49Z,I love Brainiac.. Please seed if you have to
,Link_Life,2009-04-23T02:48Z,"Please seed, only getting a few seconds of 1 kb/s every few minutes before it drops back to 0. Will seed the hell out of this if I can get it!"
,weezl,2009-05-05T12:53Z,"@rocker9455
uninstall ALL codecs
uninstall ALL players
install cccp
install VLC

with those two, you're pretty much covered and can play whatever the net throws at you."
,Fox_Almighty,2010-04-15T04:04Z,"@ weezl, K-Lite has nothing to do with anything... I've always used K-Lite and have never gotten any issues with any video types. I've tried VLC twice in the last few years and it still sucks, or at least to me it sucks... There's way too many formats that it cannot play.

@rocker9455, you installed 3 different sets of codecs, K-Lite has it's own xvid and divx codecs within it, all you did was have K-Lite conflict with the other 2 codecs and that usually results in issues. Uninstall all codecs, including media player add-on codecs if any, then install the mega K-Lite codec pack and that'll install all codecs for everything and will allow you to play all video and audio formats including the rare ones.


Thanks for the rip, I'll be sure to seed for a while as long as the quality is good and until I'm done watching them all."
