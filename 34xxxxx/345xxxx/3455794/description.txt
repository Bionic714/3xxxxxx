Here you go, ALL Brainiac episodes to date (2006-03-10).
And when I say "ALL", I mean all that are listed at www.tv.com
The eps have a wonderful quality and are released by www.itmn.org
(this time you whiners won't find any episodes I haven't included in this torrent)

Brainiac is much like MythBusters except for the following:
-it is much less scientific
-it is more "for show"
-it is british
-and it draws it's viewers with sex.
If you like MythBusters then you'll like Brainiac. You can dl MythBusters here:

I don't want messeges concerning subs, there aren't any in this torrent and I DON'T
know where to get them, so just learn english!
Don't msg me about "i can't play the files...", download VLC! (www.videolan.org)
Seed atleast 1:1
And don't msg me about seeding if your dl averages around 20 KB/s

if you have any other questions you are welcome to msg me @TPB :)



Sidenotes:
Have in mind that not all you see on Brainiac is a 100% real.
For instance their TNT-sticks are hardly solid TNT, but more likely a small
amount of TNT inside a big shell (note the extremely small explosions).
And I suspect that they sometimes augment certain explosions
so that they look better on TV.
Watch extra closely when they put a TNT-stick next to a cars tire and let Tina
ignite it - the car explodes from within it's center (not from beside the tire).
There are more examples, but these are the most obvious.

If you want to buy Brainiac on DVD go here: 
http://www.skyoneshop.co.uk/ProductsInCounter.cfm?subcat=4601&ShopRef=69&cat=538
So far only s01 is available and is priced at around $22 (┬ú13)
which I think is a very good price. (compare to MB $20 per episode)
