,MrChompy,2007-12-14T21:52Z,c'mon ladies - pls seed a while - i'd love this mix..
,robberbutton,2009-04-29T23:54Z,"Any chance this can be seeded, i'm desperate to see if it's the mix i had on cassette tape, now sadly deceased :("
,SnapperNZ,2009-11-17T21:22Z,"I too had this on cassette and after listening to one of his White Noise sessions just yesterday I was wondering if I'd ever find it again (just emigrated back to the UK after 7 years overseas).  Alas, no need too!  What a wicked mix, and with John Peel too - can't wait to play it again!!!   Anyone in the UK wanting to hear him or similar should be at Atomic Jam this weekend.... www.atomic-jam.com :P

THANKS HEAPS for this brilliant upload!!!"
,SnapperNZ,2009-11-17T22:43Z,"Oh!   It's not the Peel mix - but stll, AWESOME!!!  A lot of the same tracks as the Peel session.

Anyone with the Peel session from '95? "
,SnapperNZ,2010-02-15T21:53Z,"I should update - the John Peel session is, well, not.  It was ALWAYS the Essential Mix - I was confused.  WHAT a mix this is, LOVE it."
