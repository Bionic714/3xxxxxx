,Xarko,2006-03-15T17:48Z,Thanks a lot. Quite a few few pics and info. Makes my preorder seem even more like a good choice :)
,Miral007,2006-03-15T23:52Z,"cool seen this one though, don't suppose you have the OXM may review??"
,Xarko,2006-03-16T11:52Z,..and the strategy guide scanned? :)
,Miral007,2006-03-17T07:38Z,"heh yeah screw oxm, the guide in a pdf document or something would be awesome, since none of the stores round here bother to get it in"
