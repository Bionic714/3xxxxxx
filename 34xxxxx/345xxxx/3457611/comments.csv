,Superballs,2008-03-08T19:52Z,"Hey guys, thanks for keeping this one up here for me.

Hope you're all enjoying it, I'm glad it's still here cause i've lost it, anyway it gives me a chance to seed it for a while, though i've since moved cities and of course changed ISP to one who likes packet shaping and filtering torrent traffic.  Fun stuff!  But now I guess I'm downloading it from y'all this time lol."
