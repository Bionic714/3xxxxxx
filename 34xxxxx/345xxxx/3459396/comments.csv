You really must be a retard if you cannot see the difference between the Xbox360 version and the (original old) Xbox.
Excuse me for my bluntness, but have you seen the size of this xbox torrent? Een xbox game, which is a very good game. And it's even so good that they want to put the old version on an Xbox360 console. Then, of course, the file (*.iso) should be bigger than 1.16 GB

Look at the xbox360 King Kong, and you'll see that the rip is roughly 5 times bigger. I can go on telling you why this this is only for the 1st original. 
Just 1 more thing: MAYBE, you can download it and play it on your xbox360 modded xbox, but the picture wouldn't be in High Defination, and that is the whole reason that Microsoft, and other game companies created a newer version. There are other games they enhanced, so to speak. Another example would be ""The Chronicles of Riddick.

Again my appologies for my bluntness, because there are no bad questions. but if you have a modded xbox360, and if you had the xbox (original), then you should know by just looking at the size of the file which is for which.

Kind Regards,
