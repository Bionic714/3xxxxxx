10.4.4_SSE3_ONLY_KERNEL Unselected by default

This kernel is Intel/AMD sse3 only and doesn't have NX/CPUID/RTC/SSE2 patches 
so only use it if your cpu doesn't need any addictional patch , if your system panics at boot, type mach_kernel.old
at Darwin boot prompt to boot with the old one

md5 of the original iso where the ppf should be applied is d0bcd93dd9b40b072dc4cc4c6111d0b0 *MacOSX_10.4.4DVD.iso


If the md5 doesn't match you will only screw your iso
