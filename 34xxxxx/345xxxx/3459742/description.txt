Formed in July 2004, Just to Annoy Ray have quickly established a reputation locally as a band with quite a unique sound, fusing elements of folk music from around the world with rock and funk. This amalgamation of influences creates a sound that keeps the listener guessing, wondering what sound is coming next, whether in a live environment or on CD. 

Their debut CD 'Love Unoriginally' has been very well received by the local music community, its first run selling out in a matter of days. Best described as progressive folk rock, JTAR's 6 track CD takes the listener on journey through the transfixing title track, to the hauntingly beautiful Stepping Outside, to the good old-fashioned rock stylings of Soap Scum.
