,Xeno2007,2006-03-02T11:19Z,90 seeds and over 700 peers and i'm getting a crap 1-8 KBS download. Anyone else having this problem?
,Dimey,2006-03-02T11:31Z,"""WHY, and I really want to know, compress an already compressed AVI into freaking nonstandard RAR format???""

Because the file is distrubuted usaly on DC, so if you loose a connection to one rar achive you can then download that from onother person. Or you can download different achives from different persons. 

I think its an old stupid way my self as the medium is already compressed, and i dont use DC my self. And even with ftp you would get less ""overhead"" :P

But its a secure way to be sure you get the correct data, and if anything missing easier to download 14 mb then the hole file, lets say 400mb.."
