I'm not sure if every utlility works with cm9798 version 2.93.  As with anything, please back up your data before experimenting (or install a second version in a different folder).  I don't really use editors, but it's fun to play around with the values once in a while.  And it's always fun digging up old stuff too!

If you're looking for less stuff, try my other CM 97/98 torrent (which has the game and the first 9 editors & utilities in this list):
