...this one for early UNKLE stuff
and a note, shadow had nothing to do with BOMBAY 2: ELECTRIC VINDALOO or the early UNKLE stuff (including the APE SHALL NEVER KILL APE/MARCH OF THE GENERAL track"
,d-pad,2006-04-13T22:27Z,"ok, a shadow purest like myself is intrigued by the tracks Fixed Income part 2 (new equilibrium) and Midnight (urban industrial mix)... after downloading realized that the former is actually What Does Your Soul Look Like pt 2 from the live In Tune And On Time LP, and the latter is some ""bootleg"" re-edit of the Gab Mix... FYI ^_^"
,Jay_kay123,2006-08-06T21:45Z,All that time wasted on sucking your own cock mrtn; when you could have been helping others to enjoy the genius of Shadow....
