 Xinema - Different ways - (Unicorn) progressive/symphonic rock

 To all fans of Saga, Rush, Trevor Rabin, Camel and Cannata, 
 I just say this record's for you! It has all ingredients you're 
 looking for. Lots of keyboards sweaping around, great edgy 
 guitar-fills and best of all, wonderful drumming from Jonas Thurén!
 This Swedish band's one of the most interesting this year. 
 I'm already longing for their follow up...

 Question: Name a Swedish band that has signed a deal with a Canadian 
 record label? Answer: Xinema... a progressive rock band, consisting 
 of 3 experienced musicians, who already played together in the band 
 Madrigal during the second half of the 80?s. 
 Back then their music was inspired by the likes of Genesis, Kansas, 
 Rush, Styx and Yes, nowadays they produce a perfect mix of progressive 
 and melodic rock. We here at Rock Report cover both styles with a lot 
 of enthusiasm and I?m sure the music of this 3-piece must be able to 
 catch on a lot of you. The compositions are well thought-out and the 
 performances of Mikael Askemur (lv, b, k, g, pr), Sven Larsson (lg, bv) 
 and Jonas Thurén (d, lv, bv) are well-finished as well. 

 Add to that a good production and a brilliant cover and you have an album, 
 which will grow into a collector?s item in the years to come. 

 Don?t let this jewel slip away! *****
