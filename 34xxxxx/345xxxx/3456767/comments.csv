Crap"
,Sh4d0w,2006-03-13T07:56Z,"Well remove all drives actually works with Daemon tools v4 
but if you dont want to unplug you can just disable your 2nd ide channel in the device manager ;)"
,Karras,2006-03-13T13:29Z,"Disable via DM doesn't work with all chipset, wise guy?!"
,ardnoosh,2006-03-13T17:31Z,"actually for those who either don't know or can't unplug the drive and ide's , you don't have to, it works without unplugging as well, i guarantee it.

try it , if it didn't work then say. 100% works.
