-TAGLINE-
	With a title like that, I don't think it needs a tagline.

-WHAT THE DVD SAYS-
	At the edge of a grand estate, near a crumbling old mansion lies a strange 
stone building with just a single room. In the room there lies a bed. Born of 
demonic power, the bed seeks the flesh, blood and life essence of unwary travellers? 
Three pretty girls arrive on vacation, searching for a place to spend the night. 
Instead, they tumble into nightmares - and the cruel, insatiable hunger of the Bed! 
Death Bed is a one-of-a kind experience: comic, horrific and dreamlike, that truly 
has to be seen to be believed. Discover this neglected marvel of American horror for 
yourself!

-WHAT REALLY HAPPENS-
	There's a bed. People sit on it. It eats them.

-Notes-
After seeing this movie in a Newbury Comics, how can you ignore something with a title like that? Every time I went in, I felt it beckon me. Finally after putting it off (was I afraid of it?) for almost a year, I broke down and got it. Its a trip, that's for sure. At least its original; I can bet that you'll never see something quite like this. At times I was unsure whether or not it was trying to be serious, or a satire, or what the fuck was going on. 'Released' originally in 1977 with no credits whatsoever except for the title and 'Copyright George Barry' it became somewhat of a mystery/uber-cult flick. Besides the father from Boy Meets World, this was pretty much the only film that anyone involved in it ever did.
