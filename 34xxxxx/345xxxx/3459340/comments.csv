,_-klempo-_,2006-03-19T00:56Z,"This looks much like Undying - PC game inspired from the pen of Clive Barker - which is one of my favourites games.

However, I always preffered H.P.Lovecraft more, because of his unique way of interaction with the reader. If this game is half thrilling as his novels, it should be worth buying."
,arxidaras,2006-03-19T10:55Z,"Is this a BETA or something? The official release date is 27 March for US and 23 March for EUROPE...

,Senso,2006-03-19T17:07Z,"It installed ans started fine for me. I'm able to play the beginning, which looks great. Although the game crashes when I try to go downstairs, after finding the ""experiment"" (no spoilers).

,buzz_uk,2006-03-19T17:31Z,Awesome.  Been awaiting this title for ages.  If its as good as Undying was at the time it should be a real treat for fans of the macabre.

 1. Unrar.
 2. Burn or mount.
 3. Install.
 4. Play the game.

Which is kind of obvious... The graphic card drivers is not the issue either.. I have the latest Catalyst and since CoC is based on a 2 year old engine I don't think you need any newer driver than Catalyst 5.2 - This release should be NUKED or a patch should come out A.S.A.P. 

been waiting 3 years for the game and the first release is of it is bad------zzz---

,samuraimoppi,2006-03-20T01:44Z,It works fine for me!I have to say that this is one of the best games ever!Uuuh its scary but in the same time its great!gratz to Ras_Putin and to those guys who made the game! 
,shlitex,2006-03-20T07:50Z,"DreadNatty: Calm down and take yourself together... It's clear as well that the game worked for them majority of people here, so the fault is obviously on your side of the keyboard... read some manuals... PS. nervous brake downs haven't helped any one :P"

,DreadNatty,2006-03-20T19:19Z,"::: QUESTION TO ALL THAT HAVE GOT CoC TO RUN:::

 - did you burn the game to a DVD or did you mount it with daemon tool?
"
,Senso,2006-03-20T19:57Z,"It works! I update my Intel Mobile drivers and now it doesnt crash anymore.

I used Nero ImageDrive to mount and install the ISO."

,arxidaras,2006-03-20T20:53Z,"Works fine and looks great!! 
If you have problems running the game install the latest graphics drivers of your card. If you still have problems try to turn off antialiasing of your graphics card. 
Also works fine with media player 10 and a dvd connected. I try it using Daemon Tools and no problems at all. Great game!"
,Igziabeher,2006-03-20T22:44Z,"daemon tools works!

everything worked for me!

Good Game!

and dreadnatty dont say shit like ""been waiting 3 years and first release sucks"" it just makes you sound like a dick.

the release groups spend their time and risk their freedom (lol) to bring you these illegal downloads. so if you feel like bitching about a job someone you dont know did out of the kindness of their soul, just go buy the fucking game. the release groups deserve some credit and respect, not smartass kids whining about how they cant get it to work. 

and its likely your fault it wont work anyways. like i said, just go buy it if you want it so bad. if you own a computer you can afford it. or is this your *sic* mamas computer? not allowed to buy mature rated games?

perhaps its time you stopped hanging about here and actually Fixed some of your problems. everything has a solution, provided youre smart enough to see it."
,rubberlegs,2006-03-21T08:27Z,"Mounted the iso with daemon tools and installed, works great so far. Dont have any problems with the video crashing using WM10."

Im just trying to pin-point where the problems are with this release, what video-cards people are using, system specs, what virtual drives etc etc... How can it be so different from user to user when all seem to have the basic requirements to play it... must be an error with the release.."

Oh...my...god... I have in my days encountered plenty of guys like you; quasi-intellectuals who try desperately to position themselves ahead in various debate on the internet, and always using the same old boring tactic: to mark word. Well, ok; I guess a lot of real 15 year olds might be intimidated by this and back off, now you're unlucky though, since I am way older that 15, and have an agenda you couldn't even begin to comprehend. So; you want to mark words, then let's do it. When I used the phrase ""your ""PC"""" I put ""PC"" in quotations mark not as to mark a quotation, but to simulate what arxidaras refered to when he said this: ""yeah the one that your fucking PC never run!! HA HA HA HA!""
"
,DreadNatty,2006-03-22T21:26Z,"He (arxidaras) is probably a real 15 year old, and my knowledge of computers is way past refering to a problem being a bad ""fucking computer"", that's  why I lowered myself temporarily to his level and explained to him (in his language) that yeah; My PC might be too ""stupid"" ... "
,DreadNatty,2006-03-22T21:27Z,"So; in case you didn't know it, quotation marks can also be used describingly, as if you would ""quote"" someones meaning or reference ny using another word, or term. Almost in the same way you use a metaphore I guess. So; what do you really have to say to the problem we are discussing here? so far I have only gotten two bits of exhausting amateur arguments from you. "
,DreadNatty,2006-03-22T21:27Z,"1) a lie. - you have not played 90% of all games for PC since 1998. 2) A marking of word (which would be so much more effective if I actually would have made a contradiction or used incorrect facts)
If you have ""installed, ran and uninstalled dozens of games"" (something I believe, I have also been playing more than 12 games since 1998) then maybe you can shed some light on to why this game doesn't run on a computer that meet all the minimum requirements, and even have a video-card listed by the developer as a recommended card?
And if you just use ""cos u r stupid"" as an argument, well.. then I guess I've ""won"" here, as well..."
,DreadNatty,2006-03-22T21:29Z,"Last remark for today; English is my second language. Using miss-spelling as arguments feels very cool knowing that, doesn't it...?

,Deboss,2007-04-20T14:40Z,im having problems saving on this game can anyone help?
,Skalleperra,2007-07-01T01:52Z,"Ett av dom coolaste och snyggaste spelen nånsin fan, spela nedsläckt med hög volym fan. Asså ladda ner det här och seeda gärna en bra stund. Blir lite svårt efter ett tag, men det klarar ni nog fan. Jävla små fula haspar. Mörker är coolt."
,rrx_88,2007-07-13T13:10Z,"Sjukt bra spel! Läs böckerna med, HP Lovecraft is a genious!!!"
,BlizBob,2007-07-17T00:54Z,"Ok. This game is totally not working. For me at least.
It installs and starts but it's filled with graphic artifacts. I tried to play it but it's impossible. Does anyone else have this problem and is there a fix?
WinXPpro sp2, K7NF2-RAID, GF n6800xt 128mb, amd 3000+. Latest drivers for everything."
,BlizBob,2007-07-17T01:35Z,"Allright. Now for some reason I got to actually play the game. For a while. Then I got hit in the face by this bright white screen wich was nice since I was there sitting in the dark...
Tried again with no luck. Same thing.
I'm suspecting some neat little graphical feature is to blame.
I've got AGP DX9 card.
Everyone who got this game running without any problems please tell your system specs. OS, CPU, graphics card, mobo ect."
,BlizBob,2007-07-17T03:37Z,"Ok. Latest thing I've found out is that the lower the resolution the longer you can play if at all.
Aparently there is and wont be an official patch.
Darn... it seems like a game wich I like to play."
,BlizBob,2007-07-17T03:38Z,"Deboss:
Use the flaming eye symbols like in the start when you go in you know where."
,BlizBob,2007-07-17T07:20Z,"This is some seriously bugged game. All of you whom this worked fine can consider themselves lucky. I was about the net looking for a fix but found none. Finally I found a way to make the game ""work"".
Those of you like me who have artifacts right at the starting menu and some times the srceen might turn white while playing I have two tips.
1. set the resolution to 640x480 and refresh rate same as desktop.
2. don't touch mouse in menu.
This way you should be able to play the first part of the game trough.
When you get to the town with the bus you can play at least with 1024x768 resolution with no problems as could I... hopefully.
Hope this helps some of you."
,BlizBob,2007-07-17T07:24Z,"And now I'm getting ""failed to create device"" when I try to start the game.
I'm getting seriously mental here.
World swings in my eyes and heart rate is going sky rocketing.
I will play this game even it's the last sane-ish thing I do."
,BlizBob,2007-07-18T12:12Z,"Ok. If you get graphical glitches just play for a while in 640x480 and it'll work fine other resolutions.
the ""failed to create device"" seems to go away if you shut down your system."

,epeters2,2007-10-18T03:47Z,"sounds like if i can get it to work it'll be great. just run at 640x480 for ""a while""? 30 min? a day?"
,mitcjase,2008-01-13T20:24Z,"It starts up just fine, but I can't get past the area beyond the Autopsy Room with the Yithian machine and the guy that's been eviscerated. I zap him, take the crystal, open the door on the left. Works fine until I try to step down there, and then BAM! I get knocked back to windows with a black window still up and Jack breathing. Then I get the ""coc_dcote.exe has encountered a problem and needs to close"" thing. Any solutions to this?"
,mitcjase,2008-01-13T20:59Z,"The process was actually ""cocmainwin32.exe"", I was just using that other thing as an example."

,Yildirim,2008-03-16T17:43Z,"pls, can somebody help me? im a noob, and i couldnt unrar the files...i tried it with total commander. Could somebody advise me a useful unrar program? THX!!"
,goatfoalgoatfoal,2008-05-18T04:54Z,"game works fine for me, but i had to go find the actual executable for the game, it gives you the launcher in your start menu, but the actual executable to make the game run is in your engine folder where you installed the game: its called CoCWin32.exe. Run that and it should start up.

I havent had any problems with the actual game...i dont know why everyone else is. my system is:

Windows XP Pro SP2
AMD Sempron 3200+ (1.8ghz)
1.2GB DDR1 RAM
nVidia GeForce 7600 GT
Creative Soundblaster Audigy 2

I run the game fine at 1024 resolution, with antialiasing at 4x. I havent tried any other setting. i would say that the reason anyone is getting problems is due to a bad install or an old system. It is a 2006 game. Go look up the minimum and recommended system requirements."
,Franardo,2008-08-05T03:58Z,"Everything through installing works fine, however the computer fail to recognize that it is installed even after i do it, I can repair it, but actually uninstalling causes ""catastrophic failure""

And is this ""Engine"" folder ""Engine32.cab"" or is there another?"
,Franardo,2008-08-05T04:07Z,"Well I got further, I am attempting to start the game when it says ""Enumeration failed"" and closes.

ANY subjuestions?!?!    I'd be more grateful then a 15 year old nerd getting head!"

I used to get the crashing whenever the game would start playing but after doing that it stopped and now I can play the game, so far so good; this should work for people both on XP and Win Vista/7 I think"
,associate,2011-07-30T22:04Z,In order to save games you have to set you clock to 24 hours. Don't ask me why.

NOW when I get to the scene where a lady hanged herself soon after getting in the grocery store, the game just freezes (it happened twice at the exact same moment).  I'm stuck now, and don't know what to do.

One more thing, how the hell do you save in this game?  Can't seem to find any save option, I have to finish an entire level(chapter?) for the damn game to save.

Nice interesting game, but damn its buggy and got a shitty compatibility."
