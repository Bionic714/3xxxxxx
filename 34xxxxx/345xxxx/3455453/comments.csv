,Xeno2,2006-12-29T00:39Z,"Just so you know, the Animated versios were great.  But the Animated LOTR never got past two Towers. So don't bother trying to fnid Return of the king. It was never made. Just so you don't go crazy looking for it. :)"

Thank you SO much for uploading this. As a kid, I remember watching these and all the legal B.S. with Tolkien Enterprises has really messed up things. Very highly apppreciated, you're the best! "

,samsweet,2010-02-24T23:17Z,Could be a glitch in the torrent.
,limeydivad,2010-03-18T18:14Z,"I remember thinking what a great pity the whole trilogy wasn't completed.  I enjoyed it tremendously when I was young and look forward to seeing again.
Great quality u/l; don't waste time being  a critic, just enjoy.
Can't thank you enough MooLy

Nope, it's cd1 of The Lord Of The Rings (1978)

Both CDs are correct and great quality.

Thanks for the up! :D"
,pirateradiorocks,2011-06-26T02:54Z,"Cool, thanks very much!!"

,Wave_rider,2011-11-17T21:09Z,"never saw this as a kid. Always watched the Hobbit and Return of the King at my grandparents. So classic. Quality on this is a +1, but disappointed to see how different the artwork in this is; just doesn't do it for me! Good quality. Worth d'lding

a/v: 10/10"
,sirneon1,2012-03-20T19:41Z,"Remember seeing this as a kid. The Rankin/Bass versions of both The Hobbit and Return of the King are superior, but this one is still fun. And thanks for helping me rescue my aging VHS tape."
