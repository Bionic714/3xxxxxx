,marcusvr,2006-04-06T01:21Z,I didn't found the keygen...
,barateau,2006-04-12T15:25Z,"Ofcourse you have to extrakt ALL the .ZIP archives and then it probably lies .RAR archive inside those and you have to extract them to.
Simple!"
,MattFoley,2006-04-16T02:51Z,You are a fucking moron for zipping a rar file.
,davidtorrent,2006-04-29T20:47Z,the second through the eighth rar was corrupted
,barateau,2006-05-09T12:57Z,"MattFoley,

Are you a crackhead or what, it comes like that from the scene."
,Dead_Man77,2006-05-11T05:53Z," ????? Great upload, thanks a lot ?????
???????????????????????????????"
,Der Steppenwolf,2006-07-31T11:53Z,"What is the point zipping AND raring the archivs ?? 
Cocksucker, learn how to use archiving programs...!"
,phusg,2006-10-11T16:29Z,"Takes a bit of effort unzipping and unraring it all, but it's worth the effort as this is the real deal. It helped me with a deinterlacing issue with TV on a Hauppage PVR 150 MCE. Apparantely older versions of the Nvidia (then DVD) decoder aren't compatible the newer updates for MCE 2005..."
,techcf,2006-10-18T22:21Z,"All: Read the SCENE RULES! (They are on wikipedia)

The original release is RAR'd then the NFO's from release sites and such is put into the ZIP's. Using both compression techniques also makes it smaller."
,mark429,2006-10-27T04:48Z,"thanks man, wow you guys are some whiney bitches"

,holyhansen,2007-08-25T09:40Z,"To all of you whiners that complain about both zipped and rared archive:

You are so fucking lame I can't believe it, all 0day scene releases are packed this way!!!

Fucking whining maggots that don't know shit, that's what you are!!!

If you complain about something you should know what you are talking about, not spew out n00b shit, assholes..."
,SteadyH,2007-09-17T00:06Z,"holyhansen

get that pipe out of your ass faggot"
,patrick80639,2007-10-17T17:22Z,"Wow, how stupid could someone be to rar and zip this? Thankfully there are plenty of alternatives here posted by people who know how to archive properly. Next time, spend less time on gay ASCII art and more time packaging things right."
,SharpieFTW,2007-11-28T22:48Z,"To everyone that's whining and bitching, how about you either a) go buy the program or b) crack it yourself so you can put the effort into packing it how you want it to be. Be thankful for the release. Jackasses.

I swear, it's the people that are not appreciative of other peoples work that are the ones that should get thrown into a cell."
,ffttss,2007-12-10T17:16Z,"barateau sorry on behalf of whining 10yo lackeys here.

Thanks for upload, this really is the only Mpeg decoder to use. In my opinion...."
