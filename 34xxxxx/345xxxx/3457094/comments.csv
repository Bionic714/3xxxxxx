,nura,2006-03-20T16:24Z,tombar.. thanks for the work. was looking for a long time for this one. problem though. i cant get any audio during the movie play. intro and menu audio is fine. after apple dvd player failed to produce audio also tried vlc and mplayer from the mounted image and the burned dvd. any clues on your side? dont have any similar problem with all other dvds.
