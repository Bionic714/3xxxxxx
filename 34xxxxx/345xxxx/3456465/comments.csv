Seriously, the reason ?big names? like Nietzsche, Emerson, and so on are respected is that they aren?t idiots like this author. They took their time and read and thought and then wrote about the tension between individual and group. This is like Ayn Rand only dumber; the very idea makes my teeth hurt. If you want to be a little anarchist, go read Bakunin or something useful. I mean, really, I think this book lowers the info in your head. Sorry to bag on you bitsmurf, but upping this torrent is like stapling a cat turd to a bulletin board."

Only the people long dead have permission to speak, and everyone else somehow is equated to animal feces :)  Well, I guess some people just can't accept that others don't want your control.  Anarchy?  Yeah, freedom = pain and suffering, that's why America is so much more peaceful than say, Cuba.  Love the intellects and their excuses :)  Kick ass.  Meanwhile, have a free book and a beer!"
