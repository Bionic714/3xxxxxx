"The dreams that burn in the hearts of billions have been growing stronger through the millennia. Ages of destruction wrought by tyranny will not go unanswered. The children of this world are owed a liberty from slavery that can only be satisfied by the utter eradication of evil from the earth."

"Never in all of history have the elements been arrayed against the evil manifest in tyranny and slavery as they are today. Today is the most exciting day in all of human history; it is the dawn of the freedom of mankind."

This book defines the doctrine of liberty, and teaches you why choices that affect your life can only rightfully be made by you.
