,voyeurman,2006-09-12T15:42Z,Thank you very much for the upload! This is the only DVD ripped torrent for the Miniseries (Pilot episode) for Battlestar Galactica (TV). thanks again!!!!! :) 
,shinobiung,2006-09-22T11:36Z,"This is the 2 part pilot.

Shame it stinks. Pure American crap. Its Beverley Hills 90210 in space. Infact, thats what they should have called it. 

No substance to it what so ever."

Thanks for letting me see it before I wasted my money."
