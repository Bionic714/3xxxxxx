,SC_kutaiso,2006-03-13T17:19Z,not sure actually
,SC_kutaiso,2006-03-13T17:39Z,"Just sais version 12 (pre-release)

so you who've already got the pre-release shouldn't bother downloading I think"
,tarekmi,2006-03-13T18:10Z,when is the official version being released
,nordaaa,2006-03-13T18:39Z,"so it's old? version 12 prelease is old... the newest got a offlice icon in the upper left corner, where you open the menu, you checked this? not the normal system icon, but a much bigger one."
,SC_kutaiso,2006-03-13T21:40Z,"Tarekmi - the official should be out first after when Windows Vista has been released (In the middle of this year)

nordaa - well, I assume it's an old pre-release, anyway it was the one I could find, and I just wanted to share it with whoever would be interested so no, it's not an intirely new version =) SOrry to dissappoint those of ya who thought so, but this (pre-)release has been out for some time now"
,nordaaa,2006-03-13T21:48Z,"but to share is the right spirit, SC."
,SC_kutaiso,2006-03-13T22:24Z,"It sure is nordda, it sure is =) and I will keep on doing so for a long time :D :P"

,speechrecognition,2006-03-14T13:23Z,Does anyone know whether the 2007 preview office will expire automatically at a certain date? I like to know before installing. Also will there be a useable crack or serial number? I tried vista but there is no realy working crack to make it last beyond 14 days (which is a pity cause i liked it a lot). Thanks.
,clintblack,2006-03-22T09:41Z,How can i change languish or how it spells in word etc.?
