Metal Slug 3 (Xbox) 


Xbox version of the classic sidescrolling 3D shooter. The evil General Morden is back... as is his depraved plan to establish a new world order. Join Marco, Tarma, Eri and Fio on their mission to stop this madman. Little do they know of what's in-store for them lurking behind the unfolding chaos. The intense action builds in momentum with every level and leads to a climax of an unprecedented blaze of firepower. This Xbox edition features Xbox Live Leaderboards as well as the same bulletting 2D action across 5 mayhem-filled stages as seen in arcades.
