,hisham2,2006-03-13T06:02Z,"Metal Slug 3 won't boot from the harddrive for me -Just goes to a black screen then back to the dashboard. I've tried changing pal/ntsc.  Haven't tried the other metal slugs yet, I'm about to try burning the game to cd and see if it works. Btw my xbox is pal."
,hisham2,2006-03-13T07:50Z,Ok it didn't work. Just does the same thing. Can anyone help?
