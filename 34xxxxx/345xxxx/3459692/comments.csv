,kimgelotte,2006-03-19T19:25Z,"Is this the ""Fable"" that was released to xbox awhile ago? And now released to pc?"
,kely,2006-03-19T19:43Z,It released in 2005 august for PC!!!
,kimgelotte,2006-03-19T19:47Z,"Then i'm gonna try this one :) 

I'll seed this real good when I got it home, so don't worry!

Thx, pannkakslus"
[V],aarthas,2006-03-19T19:56Z,"OMG, what an annoying title"
,Gelvin,2006-03-19T20:00Z,its Fable - The Lost Chapters... which is longer than the game for xbox =) but the game is still short and way too easy
,Dead-Inside,2006-03-19T21:09Z,"It's kinda good but it has no depth at all. The story is pretty weak (It's like your average kiddy fairytale).

The ability to choose to be good or bad throughout the game is much better demonstrated in the (IMO best) RPG Knights of the old republic, though that touches the Star Wars universe and this does not."
,pannkakslus,2006-03-20T17:11Z,send me a message if you want to know something more
