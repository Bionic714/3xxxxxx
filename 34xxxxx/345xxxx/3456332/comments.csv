,Dofin,2006-03-19T07:51Z,"I am confirming the very good quality of this project: images are clear and sound is good Fortunately it has been subtitled, otherwise...umh ! Thank you"
,scotishpielette,2006-03-23T23:48Z,"there has to be sub titles as its spoken in tsotsi taal (sa street language) mix of afrikaans english zulu and xhosa... and a few other south african languages.. 
The main release is subtitled... but there aint much dialogue in it... so its not a problem... and if the subs werent there ud not know what was going on!!!!"

,kemmy,2008-09-23T23:59Z,need more seeders please
,zionmagus,2009-05-04T08:59Z,There aren't any subtitles on this.  I don't know if uploader is misleading on purpose but spoken language is definitely not English and there are no option to turn on subs.
,zionmagus,2009-05-04T09:01Z,"Ok, ignore my comment above.  I'm an idiot, there are subtitles but they're hard subbed and didn't show up during the beginning opening dialogue which led me to believe there were none.  Sorry OP =/"
,SirChasm,2012-01-19T01:20Z,PAL or NTSC?
