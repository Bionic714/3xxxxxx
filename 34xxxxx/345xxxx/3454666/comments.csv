There are subs: English, Spanish ad French. The site didn't take none discription for that. And please don't hink I'm gone just because it says '0 seeds'that's just a Bug in the o'system: I'M HERE!"
,superuk,2006-03-08T20:18Z,spank u very much :)
,Patrick5763,2006-03-08T21:32Z,"Thanks, just the perfect movie after a day of hard work here in Vancouver British Columbia.

A little adventure some escapism for sure."
,CYBER101,2006-03-09T00:04Z,Okay...I know 'Files' says amount:5  / the  .Iso appears as 2GB...It's not.  It's 4.35 GB [or 4.681.437.184 bytes!] Just as it says above the IMDB-Link.
,adrames,2006-03-09T00:31Z,"So this version only has DD 5.1? That sucks, my DVD player doesn't handle 5.1."
,eccles,2006-03-09T12:22Z,"@Adrames, posts of top movies by people willing to give time and bandwidth for the rest of us NEVER suck. If your dvd player isn't good enough, either don't download it, get a better player, or watch it on your PC with the right codecs."
,shellob,2006-03-09T15:04Z,"hi folks! I must warn you about not very good quallity of this movie. do not download it, rather wait for another up"
,kimjo,2006-03-09T22:30Z,"Why in h*** are there a FBI link included in this release linking to http://www.fbi.gov/ipr/ (Investigative Programs
Cyber Investigations)???? "
,CYBER101,2006-03-10T01:59Z,"As the link says...just for fun. I'm sorry, I got a weird sense of humor!"
,SnowDOG_,2006-03-10T04:51Z,Awesome!! Thanks alot! Love dvdr movies with native sound and spanish subtitles. :D
,tomahawk_dts,2006-03-10T10:03Z,180min movie + all extras + whole menu + 4GB DVD = HORRIBLE VIDEO QUALITY !!!
,CYBER101,2006-03-10T14:22Z,Although the NFO reads that this movie is untouched by the ripper it was in fact re-encoded and I have touched base with several other people who watched it and they all where very enthusiastic about the quality. It's a great release.If you have not watched it don't judge it.
,shellob,2006-03-10T15:50Z,"I wached this release!!! and I say, it stinks"
,gombei,2006-03-10T21:03Z,"CYBER101, I stopped downloading based on comments. I looked at the screenshots and continued the download. 

Thanks for this and the screenshots."
,phxcityslick,2006-03-10T21:36Z,I just want to say thank you... i'll seed when i'm done
,shellob,2006-03-10T23:16Z,why would i give my judgement after seeing those screenshots? i have seen the movie you are offering (this release)
,CYBER101,2006-03-10T23:57Z,"Shellob, that was meant to the other 719 clients  [at this moment] in general, not you!!"
,gombei,2006-03-11T05:24Z,This is apparently a new torrent and there is only the original seed.

,CYBER101,2006-03-11T22:02Z,"Alright everybody...Famous last words! We're almost there! I checked Azareus and it says that you are now almost at a 99 percent! Thanks to the little few who got it on a different level and decided to help out on this one; Pirate Bay pointed them out as 'completed' downloads when they checked in [and out]! So...NO complete downwnloads here until a few moments from now! Cyber will be signing of shortly after and I wanted to take this moment to thank the crew of P.B. for the cool spot on their server! It's been a hell ride so far and we've gathered ourselves quite a little ARMY: My Azareus counts more then 800 of you here!! Thanks to all for sticking it out with me. I hope you'll like it, I know I did! If you feel this release has pleased you: Remember to say something nice and leave your mark below! See ya soon with a new one! 
Cyber out!"

,jabbaru,2006-03-14T16:32Z,not sure about anyone else but is the last 5 - 10 mins missing on this ? 
,Jonbajo,2006-03-15T06:33Z,"How can anyone say it's bad or O.K. quality? I don't know anything about re-encoding, but it looks like DVD quality to me..."
,m013r,2006-03-15T11:12Z,thanx for this!!!!!!
,Giztorian,2006-03-16T14:18Z,"Någon som har koll på varför ""Nero 6"" inte har någon läsbuffert kvar? Som gör att det tar ofantligt lång tid att skriva imagefil."

Which means that every single motherfucking goddamn one of them shows up on a seach for ANY of the goddamn motherfuckers.

Fabulous.
