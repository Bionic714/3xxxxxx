,Batousai,2006-10-13T12:54Z,"Obviously all the albums should be included, but are all the singles included as well?"
,Kholdstare,2006-10-18T04:11Z,"brother malick, you are either gay, retarded, ignorant, or all of the above. America is keeping the rest of the world out of reach of N. Korea, so you should thank Americans (note that i am not one)
That being said, all politics aside, Rammstein deserves to rule the world. "
,miLTonaersoet,2006-10-26T17:56Z,"No Batousai , no single is with. Here follows all the ""side B"" songs rammstein have made:
