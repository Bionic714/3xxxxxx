Official Film of the 1990 World Cup

Italia 1990 was another fascinating tournament, a real melting pot of different styles, cultures, and techniques.

The biggest tournament ever saw the emergence of the African nations with the free-flowing Cameroon capturing everyone?s hearts with a worthy quarter-final run. Italy was eliminated in a tense semi-final shoot-out with Maradona?s Argentina and England and West Germany yet again produced another epic game with the West Germans running out victorious.

The final was tight and not for the squeamish, but the well-drilled and better-disciplined West Germans prevailed 1-0 over Argentina.
