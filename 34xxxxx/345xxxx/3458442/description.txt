Request: Any serials you may have for Abacus, JustFlight or any others you may
	  have. Ive got many Installers that im just missing serials for them to 
	  Install/work properly. By shareing them you will be helping the 
	  FsCommunity Greatly. (credit will be givin)
	 
   ****	Since Ive givin out some serials to other Users and they dont find it 
	 necessary to hold up thier side of the deal and upload thier installers
	 I am no longer going to offer my serials !!! I will soon post these users
	 names !!!!  ****

	Here are the users names that got serials from me, but didnt think they
	 should upload their installers for everyone:
