,Flight_Level,2006-03-17T00:06Z,"BTW, I am about one day away from opening a 24hr server for FS9. Also running on the same IP will be a dedicated Teamspeak server, which can be downloaded from www.goteamspeak.com 
If any of you are interested, send an e-mail to Flight_Level@verizon.net and I will give you all the info that you need.   Happy Landings ! ! ! ! ! Aaron"
