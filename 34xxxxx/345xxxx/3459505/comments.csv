On the other hand, the movie can be viewed/burned with a small number of glitches(not disturbing at all!). The overall quality is still OK and the subs are complete as mentioned earlier. Thanks for the film anyway

,graplegromet,2008-11-07T08:35Z,"Nice clean download. Played well. Only thing is that the movie is cut short before the end. Nothing worse than being left hanging. If I had the choice before, I'd pass on this download and look for another. That said, Mr. lusion1955, thank you kindly for the download. I only wish the end was included.
~Cheers."
