Jomi Massage has been described as "PJ Harvey on crack" a somewhat accurate description. Aggressive rock is mixed up with experimental music and more mellow parts. "the timbre of jomi massage jumps from lo-fi subtlety to brutal eruptions. " as she puts it herself. Other influences are Laurie Anderson, lo-fi indie rock and riot grrrl music.
