,xiIix,2008-06-27T01:47Z,How can it be th first one when it's 536mb? You can't tell me that a two dimensional game that ran on Sega Genesis is going to take up 536mb.
,KayeBeast,2008-08-30T14:21Z,CAN ANYONE CONFIRM IF THIS IS REAL OR FAKE?
,vtecsinan,2009-02-15T22:41Z,This is not Road Rash 3D. This is the first road rash. Just downloaded and installed....
,Thymen121,2009-09-20T12:12Z,"!!!!!! I HAVE TEST IT ON WINDOWS VISTA !!!!!!
It works fine, the reason that it is 536.47 MB, is that there are 300 mb of ingame intro's, movies, busted ,wrecked ECT

How it work's
1: Mount image (daemon tools)
2: Instal game
3: play game"

,dreamerdeceiver,2010-08-05T20:33Z,"This IS the Road Rash 3D Game. The bikes and caracthers are not 3D, but the scenery is. This is the version released for the 3DO and PC back in 1995. 

The Genesis version (Road Rash 1, 2 and 3) was completely made of sprites (including houses and even the ground was not made of polygons)

ps: the game DOESNT run (not even the SETUP) on Vista 64. I guess it works fine on Vista 32, because the message that pop-up is specifically about not running on 64 bit systems."
,dreamerdeceiver,2010-08-05T20:34Z,my guess is that people saying this is the first one are KIDS who never played the three Road Rash games released for the Genesis/MegaDrive.
,jpgamer,2010-10-04T19:05Z,"Valeu pelo torrent. Estou com um problema para controlar. o jogo roda legal mas demora para executar o meu comando. exemplo, eu aperto p virar p direita, ele vira, mas soh depois de um tempo. Voce sabe o q posso fazer?
