Rising Darkwave/Gothic act Xandria return with their third full length album - Again utilising the production talents of Jos√© Alvarez-Brill ( Wolfsheim, De/Vision etc ) "India" sees inclusion from the Deutsches Film Orchestra of Babelsberg for an added symphonic edge to the ecclectic and varied song styles found here. "India" finds Xandria expanding their style and talent into new realms of musical discovery.
