A perfect and fully working Adobe Photoshop 8.0, It's very easy to use and install because the instructions are in the 'word document' in the zip file. First you need to unzip it with Winrar, if you don't have winrar first download it, type 'winrar' in google or something. Then look at the instructions and there is a complete description how to install adobe photoshop 8.0. 

BY THE WAY: For the ones who don't know how to install a crack, 1. First open the crack folder in the zip file, if it's correct u see some complicated files in it. Don't be scared off. First you have to install the adobe photoshop and after that open the 'crack folder' as I said, after you installed photoshop you should have it on your desktop but you can't use it yet, right click on your Photoshop icon (desktop) and choose properties, then in the window choose 'Find target' after that you can see a folder (map) opening up, then open your 'Crack folder' and DRAG AND DROP the files in the 'crack folder' to the 'find target' folder you just opened. And choose 'yes to all'. And that's it!! Now u can use it.
