        Plot

Shinobi centers on the drama resulting from the war between
two ninja clans in the early part of the Tokugawa era. 
In the film, Nakama Yukie portrays Oboro, the granddaughter 
of Ogen (Lily), the respected Iga clan matriarch, while Odagiri 
Jo plays Gennosuke, the son of Danjo Koga (Minoru Terada), 
the powerful Koga clan leader. While living deep within the mountains, 
the two ninja clans have honed their skills to superhuman levels. 
Unfortunately, the clans do not get along and are forbidden by 
imperial decree from sharing their techniques with each other. 
Viewing the two ninja clans as a threat to his scheme for total 
domination, the nefarious Nankobo Tenkai (Ishibashi Renji) plots 
to intensify the rivalry between the two clans. Nakobo creates a 
contest in which the clans are forced to choose five of their best 
warriors to participate. The battle, however, isn't just a friendly 
contest - it's a duel to the death!
