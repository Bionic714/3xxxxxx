Well, what do I need to describe, it's Star Wars episode 4 to 6. Luke Skywalker and the gang.

Definitive original edition. That means originals from 1977 until 1983. No digitally remasterations what so ever. Cinema ration, VHS quality and Stereo sound. Do I need to tell more? Yes, it's the real Anakin Skywalker at the end.

I got these from eMule and uploaded them here for your convenience.
