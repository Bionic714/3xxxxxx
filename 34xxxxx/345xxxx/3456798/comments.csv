,Frezzno,2006-03-14T04:47Z,"What the? I thought that my uploaded version was VHS. Man! X0project is darn real VHS! These versions that I have uploaded are far beyond that. So forget about VHS folks, these are hi quality."

X0project might have better quality, you decide. But why wait when you can grab these now."
,david1,2006-03-14T12:06Z,"Your screens look great! I was expecting a quality much lower than that.. wow, finally I'll get to see the originals again, yay!"
,Frezzno,2006-03-14T12:48Z,"Sorry for giving misleading info. Ones again, these are not VHS quality, they are better."
,y+man,2006-03-15T09:13Z,"Seriously, thanks.I absolutely refuse to watch those new versions.If only someone would rip these old versions from the laserdisc releases in an uncompressed format."
,Frezzno,2006-03-15T13:50Z,"That's what they're about to do. Look at the comment a little above, [b]X0Project[/b]. And I don't know when they are gonna be ready."
,y+man,2006-03-16T09:22Z,"Yeah Frezzno, I saw that and checked it out.Definately looks promising, can't wait.My friend has these on vhs and he says he can defintely see a quality difference.The audio on these is definately better than vhs!"
