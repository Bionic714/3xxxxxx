,Perpetuum,2006-03-08T20:38Z,"Please use a faq or walkthrough if you are stuck in the game.
Like:

You can find a langbogen (long-bow) in the dragons cave, i believe.
Though it may be placed randomly somewhere else.
After you got it, you need to talk to the judge about the quest.

I would be interested in the english version, too.
But I couldnt find it anywhere."
,ForeverZero,2006-03-09T05:03Z,"well it ok though i need to practice my german too, hey maybe you can answer me this, who is the last guy who appears in the final video of might and magic vi, the man with the crystal ball."
,Perpetuum,2006-03-09T06:39Z,"Im not sure but I believe its that guy ""Archibald"", who also gave you the protection spell.
He's some kind of ""evil brother"" of King Ironfist.
He also reappears in mmvii..."
