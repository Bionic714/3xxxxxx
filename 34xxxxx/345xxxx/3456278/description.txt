Chris Yates, one time holder of the British Carp Record with a fish of over 51lbs is a hugely popular, much admired, prolific writer and orator on the art of fishing. Chris is from that old school of anglers; one of a rare breed who still uses cane rods and original reels. In this programme he demonstrates quite clearly that it's not the tackle that catches the big fish?but rather it's the angler's approach which is all important. On a hot sunny day at a lake in Hampshire we'll see Chris successfully fishing for carp, trying various methods including curry flavoured maggots and surface baits to capture his quarry. In his own inimitable style he totally absorbs himself into the atmosphere of his surroundings. Having the eye of a keen photographer, Chris notices and comments on the plants and wildlife and being a real country man it's not just the fishing that's important but the whole of the rich tapestry laid out before him, as he quite rightly says "you can't waste a day in a place like this when there's so much going on around you". Enjoy this fascinating insight into one man's approach in pursuit of "The Secret Carp"
