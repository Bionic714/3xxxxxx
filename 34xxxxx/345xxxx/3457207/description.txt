"India . . . Buddha's birthplace . . . the first home of Hindu religion . . .site of the greatest non-violent liberation in history. This is a land so rich in spiritual tradition that this series should either begin or end with the immersion in its religious life. Professor Eck of Harvard Divinity School, renowned among students for her lecturers, makes the gentle power of this profound religious sensibility available, familiar and welcoming to us." - The Teaching Company
