,RCG_1,2006-11-25T00:00Z,"Once you enter the code, the program is going to call up the quicktime website to download the pro features, it will also log your I.P., and I'm sure they know that thousands of others are using the same registration code.

I'd like to have this program too, 
my questions are this"" 

How safe is this and what risks are there?"
,RCG_1,2006-11-25T04:38Z,"...and how can there be so many people saying ""thanks"" and talking about how well it worked for them, when the download counter is at Zero?

sorry, it's just my nature to question ""why"", when things don't add up."

yeah that's what I get always rushing through things that are of little importance to me and trying to be a smart-ass too. That was a stupid question, lol.

Still, my other questions/concerns were reasonable, can you answer them? Thanks."
