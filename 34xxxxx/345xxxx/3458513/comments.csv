but, there is no sound, unfortunately :("
,griffinmills,2011-06-20T16:13Z,"SOUND FIX!

To enable sound open the hard drive look for the old Sound control panel, located in the \Apple Extras\Sound Control Panel folder; set Sound Out to Built-in, and you're in business.

This is pretty awesome actually now.  A few simple tweaks and this would be idiot proof.  As is, it's annoying having to manually config lots of stuff since the built in config gui leaves something to be desired and the updated versions around the net don't work on 64 bit windows."
