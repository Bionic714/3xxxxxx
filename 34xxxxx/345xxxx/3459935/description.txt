Description:

For arrogant bastards only...

Director Dan Zukovic weaves together the bizarre story
of a love triangle between an artist, a graphic designer,
and their inspiring muse. Viscount Laris (Dan Zukovic) is
an eccentric, modern-day dandy obsessed by the power of
art and visual imagery to shape the behavior and destiny
of the individual. Juxta (Sarah Strange), a striking young
cosmetician absorbed by masks, makeup, and false identities,
soon falls under Viscount's idiosyncratic influence. 

Together they plot an elaborate game where they seek to
influence the behavior of Ed Smith (Kurt Max Runte), a
harmless and complacent graphic designer, through a
meticulously planned series of staged visual events.

Smith himself is unaware that these `visual events' are
manufactured and he soon becomes obsessed by Juxta, the
mysterious woman he associates with these `charged images'.
As the game progresses, Viscount's experiments grow sinister
and cruel. Juxta, having fallen for Smith, decides to turn
the tables on Viscount. She enlists Smith's help and together
they plot their grand revenge. Sensing the defection, Viscount
is determined to raise the stakes and sets in motion a
climactic confrontation wherein all three characters will
come to together one final time, creating the penultimate
`charged image'.
