,pelle1968,2006-03-17T11:36Z,One of Miyazaki´s best.
[V],elr0nd,2006-03-17T13:31Z,"Is it the old release with english dubtitles?
Or is it the new Studio Ghibli Collection release,
with proper english subtitles?"
,Rahven,2006-03-17T21:20Z,I'm 95% sure it's the later Studi Ghibli release.
,theponyboy,2006-03-22T17:31Z,umm... so hows the seeding going?
,Rahven,2006-03-22T21:28Z,"I was offline for a couple days due to a power supply failure. My share ratio on this file is 1.25, but apparently no one else has a full file.

I'm still new to this whole business."
,lighter,2006-03-23T08:52Z,"Rahven, You should switch to super-seed in Your client. That way we all would get different parts from You and then we could take from each other. Now everybody has the same 43% and it will take a very long time until anybody has the full file. If You post what client You have, I'm sure someone will help You with the settings. 
Thx for trying anyway."
,Heineken2,2006-03-25T02:19Z,Thank you for seeding. Looking forward to this movie. Keep up the good work. Please send pm if you upload more anime movies in DVD format. Thanks
,Rahven,2006-03-27T12:28Z,"Within the next few days, I should be able to get Howl's Moving Castle and/or Nuassica of the Valley of the Wind up. Going through my anime starting with Studi Ghibli.

Are the full DVD's like this preferred over say, DivX rips?"
,uraphake,2006-04-02T04:54Z,"Full DVDs over DivX rips any day.

Oh, and Thank You!"
,watermark0n,2008-02-07T19:36Z,This torrent is dead at 61.2%.  No seeders...
,Steelbear,2008-09-01T03:28Z,Full dvd-rip! Please seed someone! Anyone!
,visionbat,2009-07-21T01:48Z,ok..I am new to some of this. what exactly is seeding and how does one do it? I use this site a lot and want to know how to seed stuff to help out
,Kerovischt,2010-02-22T00:40Z,"Hi there!

Can someone Seed the file please?"
,cpyoshi,2011-03-11T18:16Z,"Seeda !
Det är inte meningen att bra filmer ska försvinna.
Speciellt inte om det är iso, bara att bränna på skiva efter !"
