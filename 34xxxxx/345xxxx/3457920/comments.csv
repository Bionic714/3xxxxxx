This torrent is a fucking folder with recovery programs. UNFORTUNATELY the idiots didn't posts any serials, licenses or cracks, so you cant do shit, but look at what you COULD recover IF you pay for a license."

Unfortunately, I downloaded this and scanned it with my AVG Anti-Virus 8.5 and it immediately found it had ""Trojan horse Generic3.TF"" in it.

STINK."
