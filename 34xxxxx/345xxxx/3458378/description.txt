Strike Figthers: Project One


Forget advanced Sparrow Missiles. Forget flying a P-51 over nazi germany. In this game you go down and dirty to survive furios dogfigths over the middle east, either as a US Navy Pilot relying on his skill and his Skyhawk or as a Mercanary, figthing for glory in a hired F-100 Super Sabre. 

You cant thrust your missiles. You can only trust your instinct and your training. 
Will you choose a older plane to have guns when you missiles fail you or will you rely on missiles to destroy your foe and avoid a direct dogfight? Its up to you. 
But thoose MiG-17 Frescos are coming closer.
