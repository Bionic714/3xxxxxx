,MnBv98,2006-03-16T14:32Z,"Game installs but does not start on 64bit XP. 

I assume this is because of the custom dvd or the no cd patch since googling says the game itself works fine on x64."

,peter__,2006-03-24T14:57Z,"Thanks, Just_Dean. I applied all the patches, including ""NO CD Patch"" to each one. IÂ´m using Peer Guardian, maybe its blocking the game. I'll try turn it off. "
,peter__,2006-03-24T15:43Z,"Wasn't becouse the patches. Peerguardian was blocking the game to download the servers list. Thanks, Peter."
,just_dean,2006-03-29T11:33Z,your welcome m8 any probs or anything else u want just shout
,james_mel,2006-04-01T19:47Z,"Hey - Great Game - thanks for uploading.  I have followed all the cracks and installed in sequence, but all of the games crash out in Win XP, once the loading console runs and changes screen size - any thoughts on what the problem might be? Thanks again!"
,james_mel,2006-04-01T20:06Z,"Im using a Geforce FX card, so should not be a graphic problem I think.  When it crashes, it wants to send the usual error report."
,just_dean,2006-04-04T15:24Z,i need the error code m8
,james_mel,2006-04-09T15:17Z,"Hi.  Error code is: 0xc0000005

Appreciate any thoughts! Cheers"
,nzanimal,2006-05-10T22:36Z,I dont understand...got 2 maps download. One mab who says Cd 1 and Cd2 the other map is after install pack etc. And then the ISO image file. Do I burn all the maps and files to the dvd?
,raulixray,2006-07-06T10:10Z,I  cant get allied assault to work both expansions are working
,Thal,2006-07-09T19:24Z,"Expansions works fine, but allied assault doesn't...when it will load the first mission ""training mission"" its broke....and close...what i have to do????"
,Thal,2006-07-09T19:29Z," I tried to do ""EA register"" but when it will send the information i receive a error message, that i need a external conection to send...but i'm coneceted to internet..."
,say1988,2006-09-20T03:01Z,"I can't get this to install.
I can get MOHAA installed and cracked, but when I run it it has this annoying music of which the volume wont change and when I start a game it crashes. Then I try installing either Spearhead or breakthrough and it says they can't find their .exe"
,tord.w,2006-10-23T15:04Z,cd key ??
,SilentOtto,2006-11-09T01:06Z,Great upload.  It worked perfectly with little hassle.
,Snoopy_22,2007-01-10T22:22Z,"This is the best torrent I have ever downloaded.  Awsome and so easy setup its nuts and it comes with freaken music no problems what so ever! Whoever made this deserves the highest of thanks.  It had the patchs all three expansion all the cd key gens and everything.  So if anyone complains over this torrent, your a stupid pirating nub who should go kill himself"
,Snoopy_22,2007-01-10T22:27Z,"oh and
""I tried to do ""EA register"" but when it will send the information i receive a error message, that i need a external conection to send...but i'm coneceted to internet...""

u cant register on a cracked game noob"
,ironper,2007-01-19T22:48Z,"Very nice one!
I just have one problem, when I start the game I get the messege ""GLW_StartOpenGL() - could not load OpenGL subsystem"".
Any ide what it could be?"
,pawelu,2007-01-22T12:36Z,"IÂ´ve installed evrything even the no cd patch. When I try to start it says ""Insert the right CD-rom..."" Why??"
,damacles,2007-02-02T05:55Z,"Ok AA works, mind you had to use a german nocd..go figure. Spearhead and BT install fine, yes, I installed just as just_dean said. AA, SH, patches, maps, BT, nocd's. Yet SH and BT both give me errors when I try to run the games. I've tried different nocds but get the same crash. Any ideas just_dean?"
,selvin,2007-02-04T21:21Z,"I can't get this torrent working... All games and cracks are installer properly, but when i try to run Spearhead and Breakthrough i only get error code's. AA starts but crashes when i start playing...

What is the problem??

Thx!"
,selvin,2007-02-06T16:25Z,Nobody knows?
,MXCloudFF,2007-06-02T10:37Z,"What about a 100% seeder?
It seems there's none"
,just_dean,2007-07-17T23:00Z,ok dont fuckin register u noobs i have had to format my comp and lost this iso but i downloaded it and it works fine 
,just_dean,2007-07-17T23:03Z,make sure you install allthe games then crack them the games will try to look for the original exe it wont let you instal any more once you have cracked 1 
,Jackalantern,2007-09-02T19:18Z,"I setup everything correctly yet this is a really screwed up compilation.

MOHAA - Crashes when I try to load first mission, auto-configuration window is in German, not English.

Spearhead - Audio is screwed up, cannot hear anything but voices and ambience and that is it.

I can't see anything wrong with Breakthrough.

This was a huge waste of time and bandwith for me, I don't if it is because I am using Vista 32 bit or what but I've tried everything and the 2 won't work."
,duckett,2007-10-28T15:47Z,Please seed im stuck on 80.4%. Cheers Mark!!

Try to get your games resolution some lower it may work."
,wildcat.nl,2008-05-28T15:56Z,"The opengl thing is something with your drivers or videocard. I guess your computer can run the game, but otherwise update your videocard or directX"
