This is the software for the Pioneer AVIC-N2 Navigation system.  The disk is labeled 50MT Version 1.2.  The image is an .MDS and will need to be burned in Alcohol 120% and will also require a Dual Layer DVD.  This is the East Coast DVD.  It may be possible to use this DVD on other navigation systems.  The file has been compressed using WinRAR.  If you are downloading the old torrent, please discontinue and download this file as it is only 2.35GB when compressed.  I will discontinue seeding the old file in 48 hours.
