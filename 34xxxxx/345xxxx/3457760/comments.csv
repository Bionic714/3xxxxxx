,kavver,2006-03-17T00:06Z,Is this the Movie? V for Vendetta by Alan Moore?
,Foppe,2006-03-17T20:07Z,This is the old comic that the movie is based on.
,unduality,2006-03-18T03:40Z,"Ahh, and i almost forgot...
If you like Alan Moore you should REALLY read his even more brilliant comic - ""Promethea"". Pure art at its best, highly recomended indeed:

It sure is fun to post some related material when a movie comes out and watch the torrent fly! I UL'd the Orson welles radio broadcast of The War of the Worlds when the movie hit theaters

and it got about 4000 snags in the first 24 hours.
Thx Again! Let's click those banners mateys!  Hyargh! Captain Anakata's orders!"
,Amar90,2006-03-22T18:55Z,Does anyone know where I can get the movie???
,167-761,2006-03-24T20:05Z,"God!

but i need the movie!!!!:("
,ambrose777,2006-04-05T09:16Z,"Awesome, can't wait to read."
,startouff,2006-04-07T15:51Z,Excellent issue.
,screams,2006-11-17T00:14Z,"gosh people, if you need the movie type it into the movie section. i'm sure axxo has a good version of it... you're better off finding it yourself than asking for it in the comics section."
,Taboo Tongue,2007-05-06T19:05Z,"Nice torrent, great comic, if your any type of leftist (anarchist, communist, et. al) pretty nice read. Makes me mad at the movie though, they really 'did' screw it up.
ThePirateBay prevails."

You say ""Promethea"" is even more brilliant than ""Watchmen""? Hard to believe, but let's give it a chance :)"
