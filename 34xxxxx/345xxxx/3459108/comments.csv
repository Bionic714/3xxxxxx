While the audio is a bit sketchy (can't really hear the guitar) you CAN hear Sid ""playing"" the bass and that's worth the wait alone.

Plus, at least in my opinion, this is the Sex Pistols in their heyday and a glossy, perfect video just doesn't do them justice, again in my opinion.

Thanks a ton!! Great stuff...

Cheers!"
