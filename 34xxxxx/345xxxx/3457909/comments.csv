,dannymc,2006-03-16T00:51Z,anyone suggest any good software for converting DVD to DIVX?
,kbella,2006-03-16T05:41Z,"AutoGk is a great program to convert your DVDs to avi files with either the divx or xvid format.  It does everything for you.  But if you want divx, you have to have the divx codec installed on your pc.  http://www.autogk.me.uk/"
,kbella,2006-03-16T05:44Z,"By the way, is this the full DVD?  Is the video compressed at all?"
,dannymc,2006-03-16T11:47Z,"Kbella, thanks for the link, will give it a go,
original size was 5.3gig, so some compression but not much."
,dannymc,2006-03-16T14:18Z,"still uploading despite it saying 0 seeds, sorry it cant upload any faster guys/gals....dannymc"
,dannymc,2006-03-16T15:44Z,"tried a xvid version using AutoGK but the AC3 5.1 soundtrack was very low level, anyone know how to fix this??????"
,kbella,2006-03-16T16:57Z,I've never had a problem with low audio using AutoGK before.  The only thing I can think of is that if you were trying to make a 700mb file with a movie that is 2 hours long and using the 5.1 audio might have effected it somehow.  Usually you would need to make a double sized file to use 5.1 sudio with a movie that long.  But I'm not sure.
,kbella,2006-03-16T17:40Z,"There is a tutorial for AutoGK that mentions what happens to the audio when making different sized files.  It's mentioned in step 2.

,mrmoto16,2006-03-20T12:09Z,is there a way that i can put the files onto a dvd and watch it on a home dvd player?

,XTRM-one,2007-07-28T16:49Z,AT 99.9 percent with all the others can someone please seed?.... Its an awful waste of time to download these when no one seeds!
,_laaki_,2007-09-09T07:47Z,Please seed...someone. I need this movie and when it's ready I'll seed it forward
,clif19821982,2008-10-13T12:29Z,"ATTENTION VYON

I've discovered that if a movie gets to 98 or 99 % and stops, that many times it still will play just fine. So stick it in your computer and try it. 
Of course it never jumps down to ""seed"" unless its at 100 percent."
,Killer132,2009-12-20T03:47Z,Is this movie choppy? Like does it freeze a lot? I'm seeding!
,chooochooo,2012-03-05T13:33Z,"Thanks for the up and please share...

Could someone please confirm that this is the Enhanced Widescreen Edition with the English DTS audio track?"
