,russin666,2006-04-12T21:57Z,"the sounds suck a little (i dont know if its only me) but i have to put my volume way up to hear the speaking and even then it's not so loud, but then allmost everything else is very loud like music and shit."
,russin666,2006-04-13T01:17Z,"after couple of episodes im getting really disapointed, sometimes it is almost unwatchable because of the sounds, cant hear the speaking. this has never happened before with anything i have watched. anybody else has this problem? i'm not whining just givin feedback."
,sammern,2006-04-13T15:23Z,"Are U sure youre system is set up for 5.1 sound?

I`m useing the original audio, not tempered with in any way. in my 5.1 surround sound system it works great. If ur system is only 2.0 U have to tel that to your audio software, if not the center and rear chanels will not be heard and then no wonder  it sound strange.  "
,russin666,2006-04-13T16:18Z,ok. that's propably it. but how do i tell it to my audio software?
,vikingsmokin,2006-05-11T07:36Z,seed please b4 i watch season 5 i wanna catch back up again

Thanks"
,euphoria4949,2011-02-24T19:57Z,"Brilliant season, well there isn't a bad season of the Sopranos is there!

But HQ it is not! I mean if it was played on a SDTV or just a very small HDTV no bigger than a 30"" then it should be better, but on a large HDTV its REALLY poor!
Its very pixelated and a few times is out of sync with the audio. But some people may have lower standards so it might not seem so bad.
But I will still say thanks for the upload, dame I miss The Sopranos...... Still the best TV series ever in my opinion.

VIDEO=5
AUDIO=6
SEASON=10"
,fillinthisspace,2011-05-26T14:13Z,"@ euphoria4949, are you by any chance confusing the terms HQ and high definition? These are DVD rips.

I've downloaded a few different Soprano torrents, mainly trying to stick to HD rips, but as there's none I can find for season 4 I've tried some AVI torrents. I've only downloaded a couple of episodes from this torrent, but if you're looking for AVI versions these seem to be the best quality.

The other AVIs I've tried are about the same resolution but also smaller files. Even the torrents which are over 350MB per episode still don't look as good. And they use some sort of custom XviD matrix which I assume is supposed to sharpen the picture but also seems to sharpen the compression artefacts.

These AVIs use the standard h263 matrix and at 700MB per episode look the best.
I haven't found any audio sync issues yet but if I find any problems when I've finished downloading the whole torrent I'll post another comment."
