 THE SMASHING PUMPKINS - TODAY - Live at Rockpalast 1996
=========================================================

Okay, here´s the deal.
I´ve uploaded a digital (DVB, baby) recording of a single song
from the Rockpalast 1996 set that Smashing Pumpkins played.

The quality is awesome, and almost without doubt the highest there is
until (by that I mean if) they release a dvd.

Maybe Im presumptious, but I assume everyone who wants this one song equally
wants the whole set, or at least a fair part of it.

The great thing about Rockpalast/WDR is that they do listen to requests,
and somewhat regulary even ask for people to vote/request songs for open timeslots.
They have a nightly slot on sunday -> monday, not every week, but often.

So, if you want the whole concert, you´ll need to help me
in persuading Rockpalast to put it on the schedule.
There are several ways, all of which should be attended to.
The highest factor is obviously the quantity of requests, so don´t hesitate
to e-mail/newsgroup/mail/call them and solicit others to do the same.

It´s a german channel, tax-funded at that, so obviously that´s the lingo we need to use.
babelfish.altavista.com should be enough to feign ability for a few small messages.

Here´s a few phrases that you can modify/build on:

 German for the n00b
=====================

German:
-------
[1] "Konnten Sie das Konzert 'the Smashing Pumpkins' von 1996 bitte zeigen?
Ich sah 'Today' vor kurzem und es war Super!"

[2] "Zeigen Sie bitte dem Konzert 'the Smashing Pumpkins' von 1996!"

[3] "Mehr Smashing Pumpkins bitte!"

[4] "er Clip der Smashing Pumpkins war groß. Mehr von diesem Rockpalast!"

English:
--------
[1] "Could you show the concert 'the Smashing Pumpkins' from 1996 please?

[2] "Please show the concert 'the Smashing Pumpkins' from 1996!"

There´s also a guestbook and mailinglist in connection to their page,
www.rockpalast.de.
The latter requires registration. In return, the mailinglist is the place
where they´ll ask for requests to open slots, at least primarely.
You are also kept up to date with what Rockpalast is doing atm.

Right now, at http://www.rockpalast.de/wunschnacht2006/,
you can vote for different bands/songs to be placed in a show that´ll air in April.
Smashing Pumpkins is woefully exluded (though Zwan is there.. wtf?) so that should be
contended, harshly! =)


The important thing is that Rockpalast begins to see a flood of requests
for Smashing Pumpkins; Im almost certain that a few thousand or even hundred
requests would get the ball rolling.
A persistent stream of requests will almost certainly yield results.
It might take a few months before they can book it in, but it´ll get there eventually.

And as it does, me and others as technically inclined, will make sure that this sees
the way around the net to you, that guy over there, and anyone else who wants it.


Peace,
