,darklemming,2008-10-16T03:10Z,The ending was totally unexpected. Wow... just wow.
,darklemming,2008-10-16T03:12Z,"Some of the scenes in this movie could have been shorter. This is the second French movie that I saw. The first was Noel, a good WW2 movie I recommend to you all.

But seriously, whats up with the overly long scenes. I really liked this movie though."
