,elphick,2006-03-21T00:56Z,"I keep having errors communicating with the tracker, but then I've always had that with TPB's tracker."
,pandatrap,2006-03-22T20:46Z,Something is wrong with the episodes.  Is there a different set up when loading multiple files like this?
,elphick,2006-03-28T11:47Z,What's wrong with the episodes? They work fine for me (and I've checked the checksums for the files match the checksums they were released with)...
,pandatrap,2006-03-31T22:05Z,"The screen melts
Episodes are all scrambled together
I'll watch #48 then a clip from ep 20 pops up then 32, 55, 64, 11, 2, screen melting, blank, the back to the episode, for 10 sec.
I have this every time I use a multi file torrent"
,elphick,2006-04-02T23:55Z,"Has your download actually finished?

,pandatrap,2006-04-11T02:30Z,not yet I was up to 53
,elphick,2006-04-11T18:00Z,"It doesn't work like that - it's not downloading one episode at a time, it's downloading various pieces from various files and storing them in a random order. It'll only reorder all of these pieces once the download has finished (or once you've forced it to - read the BitTorrent FAQ)."

,Demosthenes928,2007-11-06T23:42Z,"Yeah, pretty sure we would all really appreciate it if people started to seed and continued to seed after they finished downloading. Right now there are only 3 people, including me, who are downloading this, and none of us have enough of the torrent to get it to 100%. So please seed."
