,bovineking,2006-03-15T11:34Z,Hey.Just wondering what reg key to use?Cheers
,ordan,2006-03-15T12:15Z,and what about registration?
,anonymous999,2006-03-16T01:30Z,"this has no service packs
If I am correct the activation scheme was
introduced with service pack 1
but I could be wrong.
get the xp pro corp keytools
for the key"
,hetajo,2006-03-16T07:11Z,Is there some special reason that people need this without service packs?
,LatHack,2006-03-17T19:29Z,"Yes, local [none-internet-access] server where low cpu usage is needed, and stability as well, could run it on w2k, but anyway, this post is just nice ;-)

this setup of internet. Nice torrent.
Thanx for it.
