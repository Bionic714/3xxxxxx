,KDMN,2006-03-20T12:35Z,Is this a cracked version or the shareware with the lvl 6 limit?
,klukman,2006-03-28T21:20Z,Is this cracked or not?
,SoulSlinger,2006-04-05T04:23Z,"New version available at: http://www.taleworlds.com

Crack available at:
http://www.skmskm.end.pl/

It took me forever to dig this up, but I finally found it, a working crack for Mount & Blade.  If the site serving the crack ever goes down I can send it by email, pm me. "
,nicke2000100,2006-04-06T12:45Z,Does the crack remove the lvl limit?
,-^Nitro^-,2006-04-06T19:58Z,"How does this crack work...it doesn't do anything but open a window where reads: 
Cracking memory of Mount&Blade By skmskm 0.731
So how in the hell it works!"
,nicke2000100,2006-04-07T18:45Z,um sry for being stupid but how do u use the crack?
,FrozenGrave,2006-04-11T15:19Z,How I can get that crack working? Does it remove lvl limit?
,samuraidd,2006-04-12T00:15Z,"Yeah, the crack doesn't work! And the 0.731 has expired... And as Nitro, for 0.711 its the same damm message and nothing happens... "
,-^Nitro^-,2006-04-12T08:39Z,"Ok got it working
1. Start the Mount&Blade (Start window not the game)
2. Start the crack
3. Put any cd key you want like 1111-1111-1111-1111

You need to do this every time you want to play"
,-^Nitro^-,2006-04-12T08:41Z,If you need the 0.731 crack just send me a PM
,smoketwojoints,2006-04-12T16:23Z,"No luck with the 0.731 cack here either. Got some nice spyware from Megaupload tho :/. Nitro, I sent you a PM. GW if you managed to crack it ;)"

,samuraidd,2006-04-12T20:26Z,"Hmmm... The method Nitro put isn't working... I've tried with the crack first, manual activation, enter serial, all the ways possible and it ain't working yet! :("
,-^Nitro^-,2006-04-12T21:22Z,"When you start the crack there should read like this

Cracking memory of Mount&Blade By skmskm 0.731
proces attach succesfull"
,samuraidd,2006-04-13T01:36Z,"Still doesn't work, damm! :( Maybe I'm doing something wrong... lol"

But how does it work? I've done the cracking and reached this stage, but can't seem to get any further: 4. Activate Game with manual activation.... The game is still in trial.

Great game by the way."
,Lordnero,2006-07-13T22:03Z,"Ok, I know how to now. Press the enter serial button in the main start screen, and then use the manual activation button. Insert any figures you like, and it should work.
