Look forward to a working 'DAXTER' on fw1.5 torrent from me real soon. But before that help me seed this one! Healthy seeds on this one means faster 'Daxter' release!

Note: This game will only work on PSP's with firmware 1.5. Anything above is a NO NO!

For noobs to PSP homebrew. Just copy paste the contents of this torrent, as they are, into the root folder of your memorystick. Go to PSP menu and Launch UMD Emulater and choose the ISO with 'system menu' selected in the 'ISO emulation' option(Use PSP digital pad to change selections). Once you're back in the PSP crossbar menu. Go back and choose MPH Loader 1.1. The game plays, enjoy!

For pro's to the GTA hack scene. All you need to do is to copy the ISO from this torrent and paste it in your PSP and you're good to go. Oh and make sure you have the 2.5 kd fodler firmware in the MPH loader that was done to make DragonBallZ work on fw1.5 PSP's. If you're not sure what this is I'm talking about. Do the noob method above and the game would play for you too.


Game saves fine(autosave is available too). No passwords, no shit like that! This game works fine on fw1.5 PSP. Everything works fine(sounds, movies). Nothing has been ripped out of this game. It's a FULL UMD ISO!
