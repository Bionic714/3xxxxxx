,damnit199,2006-03-16T10:38Z,Waiting for someone to upload Untouched ISO of 'DAXTER' so I make it work on firmware 1.5 PSP. 
,Scissorzack,2006-03-16T17:40Z,"TACK DEN HÄR FUNKAR PERFEKT! 
Så borde alla spel kunna laddas, med allt man behöver för att spela de o med redan fixad prx o allt det där krångliga skiten!
TACK Damnit199!! 
Fortsätt så!! Hoppas du lyckas fixa Daxter som du gjorde med den här!!
DU ÄR BÄST!!!"
,Jolny,2006-03-16T19:00Z,"Great that you upload these games, but put them in the Handheld-section instead, where they belong."
,damnit199,2006-03-16T20:03Z,"@ Scissorzack

Glad to know it worked for you :) I had to use a swedish translator to figure out what you said. Thanks for appreciation. Don't worry about Daxter, it is confirmed working on fw1.5 and I'll bring it for you guys soon. I just have to find the untouched ISO first."
,dontee,2006-03-16T22:19Z,"Work great, thanks :)"
,emielenwendy,2006-03-16T22:50Z,great upload! anybody knows whether syphon filter is hackable?

,mips,2006-03-18T23:16Z,"I load the iso, start the emulator and it says ""loading...""

And never finishes..  anyone else get that?
F1.50"
,damnit199,2006-03-20T07:11Z,@ ramma. First delete the MPH folder from PSP root. Then overwrite it with the one from this torrent. Do that with UMDEmu too. Similarly replace UMDEmu and MPH folders in GAME folder(in PSP). Try megaman then. Works!
,damnit199,2006-03-20T07:12Z,"@mips, do the same as I told ramma. Yours should work too. The problem mostly occurs when you're not placing folders in the right place where they are supposed to be."
,damnit199,2006-03-20T07:13Z,---MAKE SURE--- THAT YOU BOTH BACKUP(SAVE) THE MPH and UMDEMU folders that I'm asking you guys to delete. This is for your past games to work. ok.
,GKUltraMagnus,2006-03-20T23:56Z,"game freezes when you beat dr. wily (at least, with megaman on normal mode). psp freezes during explosions."
,damnit199,2006-03-21T00:50Z,Strange. Works fine with me. Try using a different loader. Try PS2nfo.com for other loaders.
,kaufebeen,2006-03-22T09:59Z,mine froze when i killed willy too. im using 1.1 mph with f0 and f1 compatible with samurai warriors and dragonball
,kaufebeen,2006-03-22T10:20Z,i tried deleting my whole mph and using the one thats zipped with the torrent. but it still hung after i defeated willy on normal mode
,Niklas20,2006-03-23T20:23Z,"Vill gärna ha hjälp med mega man powered up..

Har satt in psp,iso,umdemulator, på root folder men sen när jag startar spelet först på umdemulator med system meny och sen starta MPH Loader 1.1 men står bara Loading game hela tiden varför? snälla hjälp mig så vänligt.. adda mig på lnn4@hotmail.com om ni vill hjälpa mig.. Skulle bli tacksam."
,Sakura-san,2006-03-24T15:04Z,"Just a warning, this iso fucks up when you defeat Wily on normal, so be aware."
,damnit199,2006-03-27T17:21Z,All versions of Megaman freeze after defeating Dr.Willy. The EUR release of MMPU gets stuck at the exact same point!!! 
,cdx873v,2006-09-28T21:35Z,it wont work damnit! i have the same problem as mips. does it matter that my machine is a JAP version? i did everything that you told here in the comments..
,cdx873v,2006-10-14T21:48Z,"just wanted to tell everyone that is as stupid as i was..

does it say ""loading..."" when you do everything the way you are supposed to do? well.. try and put a UMD in the drive first!

it needs it to be able to boot your game!

so.. First you put a UMD-game in the drive. Then you load the mph gameloader!"
,ThetaRepublic,2007-02-09T21:30Z,"Sweet! Seed, please please please!"
,mexenox,2008-01-21T11:18Z,"hello gamers i don't understand the instrucktions given, even the noob version
could anyone explain it to me???
by the way, anyone speaking german?"
,Nitzrokk,2008-09-27T20:19Z,"Holy shit what's all this complication all about? Just put the .iso into the ISO folder on te root of the memorystick. Don't be a newb, hack your PSP and use custom firmware FFS! No need for all this loader garbage. Then you don't ever have to buy another UMD."
