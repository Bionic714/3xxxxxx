,bc_buds_da_best,2008-04-07T11:09Z,thx a bunch..arthuritus is the best haha
,mindy123,2009-02-10T20:47Z,Haha arthuritus is a cool nickname for him! Doug should use it more often. Anyway if anyone is having problems playing the files i would very much recommend this media player: http://www.avs4you.com/AVS-Media-Player.aspx. Supports all visual and audio formats unlike the divx player and windows media player. I used it to play the files that wouldnt work in this torrent but now use it for everything.
,seipmoney,2009-05-06T00:37Z,thanks a ton!! This was the only season 3 i could find available!!
