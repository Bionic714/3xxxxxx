,damnit199,2006-03-18T09:06Z,"Jeez, another mistake. In the description I said, MPH in this torrent will make GTA spanish. BUT IT's OTHERWISE. 

It'll CONVERT spanish BACK to ENGLISH. Sorry!"
,Scissorzack,2006-03-18T11:07Z,"WOAW ! This really works!! THANX damnit199!!
U really are the best!
Now all U have to do is uppload more of these psp games just like that and U will be a legend! =)
Syphon filter and Fifa street 2 to psp are games that I really will love to play... have U make those work!??"
,damnit199,2006-03-18T12:39Z,"Listen, I have to tell you. I'm not the one who is cracking these games. So please don't make calls of legend or whatever have you. There are many talented people out there doing what I'm only distributing. I'm just sharing and that's it. But I appreciate the enthusiasm and respect. Thanks! As for Syphon Filter. It's not cracked yet(but it will hopefully). Fifa Street sux0rs period

Try PES5 instead. PES R0X0RS!!!!11111 :P hehe"
,bblade,2006-03-18T18:44Z,How about Me and My Katamari? It is also 2.0 fw game. Has anyone tried it yet? (with MPH Loader 1.1)
,Scissorzack,2006-03-18T18:50Z,"OK! Well thanx anyway for puting the isos here becouse I dont know how to change the prx and all that!
But one question... The real size of Daxter is over 1gb and now is only 247 Mb... hows that!?? Aint a bigger one, but that still fits in 1gb memory card? Becouse this one works fine but there aint no movies...=( Only the first one intro movie... after that... everytime a movie comes, the intro movie plays again... =( Can U do something about it? I dont care iif its bigger the 900 mb only it fits on a 1gb memory card..."
,damnit199,2006-03-18T20:32Z,"@Scissorzack
Oh, this torrent is for 512mb memstick owners so yea there are plenty of movies taken out. Infact I think all of the movies are ripped out and replaced with the intro."
,damnit199,2006-03-18T20:36Z,I think what you need is a ripkit and a full daxter iso . Search for 1100mb sized Daxter torrents on mininova. Find the 808mb ripkit at ps2nfodotcom. ps2nfo needs registration. 
,Scissorzack,2006-03-18T20:56Z,"Dos that 808 mb Daxter works on mphgamloader? Has it all the prx fixed and all that allredy?
Cant U just upploadet here? Im sure many folks will  uprusiet it!
I do! Thank U very much for all the hepl and answers!!"
,damnit199,2006-03-18T21:34Z,"Extract from 808mb Ripkit nfo

- Update directory deleted
- FR/DE/IT/KO/SP datas, dialogs and movies deleted
 - Prx Files decrypted and ISO Rebuilded

Now you know what to do right? I can't upload a 1GB file anytime soon. Already uploading Daxter and PlayStation3 Conference!"
,damnit199,2006-03-18T21:42Z,"Just go to that site man. It's very easy to do yourself. Download the 1001mb full iso, then apply the ripkit fix. Once you have the new ISO, replace it in your PSP. Simple as ABC!!! Please, try to do it yourself this time."
,damnit199,2006-03-19T08:32Z,Are you still having problems with that Scissorzack? I think I can upload it but you would have to bear with super slow upload.
,damnit199,2006-03-19T09:08Z,"http://www.savefile.com/files/6058491
Use the ripkit with the instructions given in the nfo file inside it. "
,damnit199,2006-03-19T09:09Z,Get the 1001mb daxter torrent and use the above ripkit. You'd have 803mb ISO in no time.
,damnit199,2006-03-19T09:11Z,"And yes, it will work with MPH Loader1.1 you don't have to do anything. Just use ripkit and you play the game on PSP."
,Garkan,2006-03-19T13:27Z,"This works great - did get this from another site. But All the movie sequences in the game has been ripped, so its only the intro sequence that will show up under the game.
Think the whole game is ~800Mb, alsor ripped, but only all language except english (really who need spanish or german language? It suppose to be english, the subtitle can be whatever, but Daxter should speak english!)"
,Scissorzack,2006-03-19T17:27Z,I cant make that rip to work!!! =( HELP ME =(
,damnit199,2006-03-19T20:17Z,Put the iso in a new folder(not in the ripkit folder). Try going to the bat file through DOS.
,damnit199,2006-03-19T20:22Z,Go to ripkit's bat file through dos and type the bat file name and location of the ISO. 800mb file will be made in the ripkit folder.
,damnit199,2006-03-19T20:23Z,"Go to ripkit's ""directory"" through dos and type the bat file name and location of the ISO. 800mb file will be made in the ripkit folder."
,damnit199,2006-03-19T20:35Z,"Scissorzack, check your PM. I sent you the way to use ripkit. Too big message to even write here. Piratebay giving database error if I type it here."
,tehdahn,2006-03-20T02:52Z,"Nice of you not to taking credit from the release groups, but why not include their .nfo files. And even better, keep the release clean as it was?"
,damnit199,2006-03-20T07:23Z,WTF is wrong with me deleting it? It's just a friggin damn nfo file. Besides the real credit goes to the game creators. Not nfo creators. I only care if the game works or not. Please don't waste both our time with this argument I request.
,tehdahn,2006-03-20T11:09Z,"Just meant that the nfo, sfv and original rar's make a full release. (http://whyrar.omfg.se/)

Credit where credit due, but come on ""Thank you for this great software that I am stealing from you"". 

Credit to a game creator is when you buy the game."
,damnit199,2006-03-20T12:07Z,"Christ, Talk about morons! Screw you and your credit philosophy. You're arguing with me about stealing the credit away from who? Pirates? 

I don't give a fuck. So get off my back awrite. Get a fucking life instead of arguing with people about nfos that get deleted the instant files are unrared. I delete them like everybody else. I play the game and after its confirmed working then share it on piratebay. F off if you can't see that."
,tehdahn,2006-03-20T12:27Z,"I really don't get your agression. I'm not arguing about anything, I just pointed out that I would be happy if you kept the releases clean, and not tamper with the original release.

And pls, calm the f down, PLS."
,thovader,2006-03-28T22:33Z,"Thanks a dozwn damnit199 for bringing us this great game!
Thumbs up for everybody else involved in this masterpiece!

Hope you guys get Splinter Cell Essentials to run as well ;-)!"
