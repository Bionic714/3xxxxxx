,SilentRip,2006-03-19T20:34Z," This stuff is still useful though, I use it all the time on my Powerbook/Performa"
,NisseP,2006-04-01T19:15Z,"And i guess your performa runs on os 8.6 or something...

Hm.. a really nostalgic trip..."
,SilentRip,2006-04-01T23:40Z,Actually my Performa is running os 9.1 right now
,viraldna,2006-04-12T07:21Z,"Thanks, I just got a old performa  and did not want to spend cash on old software wich is so hard to find now :(

btw what model is your performa? I think mine only runs 9.0 at the most.
and you dont know if it will take EDO ram would you? I dont have any FastPage :("
,SilentRip,2006-04-17T05:44Z,"My performa is a 6400, if yours is a 5400 or up its likely that it uses DIMMs not SIMMS"
