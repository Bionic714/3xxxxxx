,FooFighterUK,2006-03-09T13:58Z,"ABC are showing re-runs in between the new season episodes :-(

Theres a lot of discussion on the ABC message boards about it.  

Looks like Australia are catching up though ( on S02E08 now ) so if ABC keep re-running Oz might get ahead :-) then we just need a friendly seeder from down under !"
,FunkyWizard,2006-03-09T15:01Z,"Just what kind of f*cked up TV system are they using in the U.S ... 2 weeks are now standard between every new episode!
 I could understand if it was reruns, but this is just ridiculous ..."
,Nite115,2006-03-09T17:39Z,"@Cedist

What kind of morons download a file that has been brought to them for free and feel they have a right to complain about it.

if you dont like this file and you think you can do better why not try uploading one of your own for once instead of take take take bitch bitch bitch."
