Instämmer till fullo. Samma idioter som gnäller om seedning är säkerligen samma personer som stänger ner sin utdelning så fort de fått ner filen."
,billowebs,2006-03-14T07:28Z,Decent video but audio is BAD BAD BAD.
,squasha,2006-03-14T21:39Z,"Downloaded the file and extracted successfully. In Windows Media Player 10, I can hear the audio (decent quality) but can't SEE the video.  

Advice? "
,SolarSys00,2006-03-15T12:28Z,"I downloaded this, the quality and the audio are perfect! I had no problems viewing it!! Excellent Opening Episode!!"
,colman,2006-03-15T12:38Z,"Great quality, both picture and sound! "
,Alis_lund,2006-03-15T15:49Z,"This IS the real thing! Really nice quality, both picture and sound.
And WHAT an ending!? I cant wait for the next one to come.. when is it btw?"
,g4money,2006-03-15T20:55Z,"Great post man, what a start episode, thanks!"
,SlickBlueSuede,2006-03-17T19:51Z,"To anyone downloading this, or any future episodes, be careful. My ISP got on my case because they were apparently contacted by HBO or someone who represents HBO because I had this on my computer. No fines, thank god, but I just want everyone to have all the information. They will ruthlessly monitor this to squeeze every penny out of people because they know they don't have much longer to milk this show for subscriptions."
,NilsNL,2006-03-21T16:20Z,"Good video quality, audio is ok. The episode itself is billiant! The best opening episodes of the series imo. And that about Meadow... indeed, indeed."
,madhartigan,2006-03-24T04:22Z,"Like SlickBlueSuede said.  Be CAREFUL  I also got something from my ISP (PenTeleData)

They contacted me within like 3 days of d/l-ing."
,2-Face,2006-03-24T23:10Z,"sickbluesuede, In the whole world only like 5 people have been judged. It's more to scare people around, i don't know where you from but, don't worry. cause it's 1 in a 100000000"
,xeladeka,2006-09-04T20:56Z,"thanks, good quality picture, but why did i recieve 20+ files of the same episode??"
,xdarling,2007-04-25T03:59Z,"SlickBlueSuede - Personally thankful for the comment - I too was contacted and shut down by my ISP for having a version of the Sopranos on my computer. I haven't downloaded any more of the Soprano files since. Count me #3 in 100,000,000 - in less than a month!"
