,A.B.,2006-09-01T22:22Z,"Installation of ""Viper racing.rar""

1. Unpack ""Viper racing.rar"" and its contents,
   ""VIPER.zip"" and ""ViperRacing_nocd.zip"".
2. Install the game (run ""SETUP.EXE"")
3. Update the game by running ""viper11.exe""
4. Place ""ViperRacing_crack.exe"" into the game
   folder (default ""\SIERRA\Viper Racing"") and run it.
   NOTE: Do NOT apply the original crack VIPERCRK.EXE
5. In Windows XP (& 2000 & NT) you may need to set the
   ""Compatibility mode"" to Windows 95:
     a. Right-click on either the game exe or its shortcut
        and choose Properties
     b. Choose the ""Compatibility"" tab.
     c. Check ""Run this program in campatibility mode for""
     d. Select ""Windows 95"" in drop-down box and click ""OK"""

,drjacko,2009-11-28T19:12Z,"Sexy game. Played the demo way back in 2001. Had just the Silverdale track. Been in my dreams since. Thanks for the upload. It was the first game I ever downloaded, because it was the only game in my mind at the time. Mind you, I am posting this comment a year after downloading it. Was not a member back then."
,FlinkerFinger_010,2009-12-27T05:47Z,"runs on Win 7 .D 

without any extra setup in preferences such as compability mode- but it was with ""scratchy sound"" when patch is not installed

i needed the beta patch till sound was ok. u can find it on this site:
http://jim03777.tripod.com/Manual_TroubleShooting.htm

direct download link:
http://jim03777.tripod.com/downloads/v123BetaPatch.zip
