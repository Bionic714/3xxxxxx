,ZeusSimeoni,2007-08-21T19:25Z,"I spent a week downloading this thing... it appears to be 3 .iso files, but no program I use seems to be able to read them.

Admittedly, I only looked at the second two CDs... I purchased a copy of the game quite some time ago and lost the second two CDs, so I was hoping to have the game once again.  But it appears the second two .iso files are corrupt."
