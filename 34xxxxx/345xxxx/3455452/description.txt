Saiko 1.0 (release 7) - Algorithmic electronica composer. (10/2000)
[by Arguru and waKa x] 

and Saiko 1.0 (release 9) (12/2000)


I decided to dig these up from my CD-ROM archives.  These are hard to find.  They were released as freeware and they were never continued after the end of 2000.  Arguru's website is also down.

Saiko is techno improv fun, with little effort.  With release 7, you can save your live jams directly to a .wav file if you'd like.  The sound is a bit tinny overall, or not enough bass and too much treble.  Release 9 has a more balanced sound and has better overdrive & harmonic effects, in my opinion, but the save function is disabled. :-(

Give these a try.  It's a very small file-- please keep this on your hard drive and reseed it everywhere.  Keep it live and alive!
