,I_QBot,2006-03-06T15:39Z,"Thanks. I second the ""WOW"". This will keep me busy for hours...   LOL  "
,quisla,2006-03-06T18:51Z,Torrentfile does not seem to work. I get an error message when I try to open it in BitComet. Anyone able to dl this torrent?
,I_QBot,2006-03-06T20:25Z,I am also getting a download error...  Says it cannot find the file specified... Maybe need to re-upload?
,quisla,2006-03-06T22:52Z,"I am now downloading. I started the torrent in Shareaza instead and that is working. Unfortunately Shareaza is much slower than BitComet and has some more drawbacks, but at least it works and I really wanted to have this nice download. :-)

Thank you trungdq for this one."
,hoskeblaffa,2006-03-07T00:39Z,It appears that one of the filenames are too long or otherwise corrupt. 
,I_QBot,2006-03-07T00:42Z,"I download to about 3%, and I keep getting a ""system cannot find path specified"". Is this me or the torrent? Please help... "
,hoskeblaffa,2006-03-07T00:54Z,"The offending file is 1-Chemical Petrochemical and Process CollectionCD2LAPEYROUSE, N. J. (2002). Formulas and Calculations for Drilling, Production, and Workover (2nd ed.)Formulas_and_Calculations_for_Drilling_Production_and_Workover_2E.pdf"
,hoskeblaffa,2006-03-07T00:55Z,It appears that the filename is simply too long. The seeder is probably on a non NTFS/FAT32 file system. 
,quisla,2006-03-07T00:57Z,"I now have 7.7% and downloading, but very slow. Like 5kb/s or less - is gonna take forever."
,quisla,2006-03-07T01:04Z,OK hoskeblaffa - thank you for your input. I will find out if Shareaza can handle this - eventually.
,hoskeblaffa,2006-03-07T01:12Z,Qusila I downloaded and tried shareaza with no success - got a file error there too. Are you on a mac or unix system ? 
,quisla,2006-03-07T01:28Z,I am using PC winXP and Shareaza v2.1.0.0 now at 7.9% and going
,Shylock,2006-03-07T10:10Z,"I dont even have close to 7% yet, but it's still going slowly. no biggie I'll leave it run for a week or two in the background."
,trungdq,2006-03-07T11:11Z,"Here is the fix for long file name: Please put the downloaded files on the top level folder (C: or D:). If you put it on deeper levels, it will raise the error message because the file/folder name are too long!"
,hoskeblaffa,2006-03-07T19:20Z,Thanks Trungdq! I should have thought of it myself! 
,Jeff62,2006-03-08T01:23Z,"Hello  Any Seed ou there?
I am stuck at 729 MB and not moving anymore
Thanks
Jeff"
,trungdq,2006-03-08T03:47Z,Please be patient. It will take about one week to download this huge collection. Be sure that you put the downloaded files on top root folder (C: or D: or E:) to prevent errors due to long file name.
,Jeff62,2006-03-08T05:57Z,"OK and thanks,
I will be patient..
Jeff"
,I_QBot,2006-03-08T22:38Z,"Thanks for the info. Put it @ C: Root. Now @ 47% and counting. If I get it all, I will seed for awhile..."

,JKLSimon,2006-11-04T02:23Z,"Hello, This the the first time i'm downloading a torrent. I'm using Bit Tornado and I'm not getting past ""yellow"" which means I've gotten connections to other Peers using this torrent.  Right now I'm stuck on ""red"" - not connected to seeds or peers
Please help."
,Mace1984,2007-01-10T18:25Z,"I realize this is an old torrent, but it's a very fine collection of litterature. However, no seeds are currently available, so if anyone will please begin seeding again, I will be grateful."
,thanatopsisx,2007-08-21T04:22Z,Many the books don't work :( So tragic. At least all the ship related books are fine :)
,Bakery87,2007-08-30T01:27Z,I cannot download this on bitTorrent.. any ideas?  does the torrent work? I could really use some of these books.
,sibinh,2007-10-18T16:24Z,I wonder that why you have a lot of ship related book. But thank you very much. Your collection is wonderful
,Markstern,2007-11-01T14:12Z,"Like a gift from the skies, this torrent! Here I am in the draft/component collection phase of designing my own air/fuel mix MCU w/ injection and ignition controls, this answers every little questionmark I still had, MANY thanks! Will seed this for a good while when I'm finished."
,trungdv,2007-11-06T09:34Z,Thank Mr Trungdq very much. You come from Vietnam?
,tsiodim,2007-11-11T09:15Z,"Come on !!!! Seed some ""knowledge"" outthere !!!"
,tigertamer,2008-01-30T05:30Z,"Suggestion:  
would it be possible to break up the mass of books by group (general category)?  that way we can download the group that most interests us, and not the whole library.   the reason for my suggestion is I am seeing many downloaders got the whole 4.7 GB only to find out the file is corrupt, or they are stuck at 99.9%... this would be a more efficient use of seeders and downloaders bandwidth, and increase chances of getting a complete set in the topic of interest.  Maybe split it into 700MB groups, would have the added benefit that some can also burn onto CD. "
,fisherbim,2008-04-15T09:58Z,"there is too much peers..
pls seed if your done pls.."
,chuybi,2008-05-01T18:48Z,Copied the torrent on my hard drive C after a couple of mins it prompts input output errors. Help

,kenshinrk,2008-07-14T17:03Z,thnx 4 the u/l and thnx 4 all those who are still seeding..
,perion666,2008-08-23T15:11Z,"Nero doesn't care for the long folder names (with all the punctuation) - depending on the version. When the names (path depth) gets too long it hangs in the middle of the burn with no error messages. 

Roxio Easy Media Creator didn't have any problems with them using UDF102 file system.
