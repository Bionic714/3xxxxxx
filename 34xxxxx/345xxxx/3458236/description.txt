Sorry I screwed up the permissions on the first ppf , Apply this ppf to fix sata support not working after reboot

To make it clear the steps are

1) original iso http://thepiratebay.org/details.php?id=3451287 md5 d0bcd93dd9b40b072dc4cc4c6111d0b0

2) Apply the first ppf http://thepiratebay.org/details.php?id=3457929, the md5 will become 66d15b0542eea2f8a047823e85265ab5

3) Apply this ppf the md5 will become 11406d017ce3d9d802d5feba0f240408
