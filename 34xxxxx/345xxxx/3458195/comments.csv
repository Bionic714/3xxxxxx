,Blathnat,2006-05-07T06:43Z,"Sadly, this is a disappointment of an album.  On the plus side, it's only 60mb, so it didnt cut into my time.  I'm a big fan of Rob, but this is shite. Very pop-rock, lighter and a lot worse than previous 3 albums.  Even if you liked Sinister Urge, dont pay money for this.. "
,KageDaimyo,2006-08-04T23:48Z,hehe. paliolunta muuta ei taskolampoa...
,mrgaay,2006-11-20T21:33Z,"this aint no fucking hard rock, Rob Zombie is metal/heavy matela crazy sake! do u wanna know any hard rock band ? Guns N' Roses and Lordi is fucking one-word-in-minute hard rock! FUCK YOU!"
,pbransford,2007-06-08T05:08Z,"OK... bitrate is VBR... but what range? You know you DO set that when you encode it...

32-64 VBR is still VBR... and sounds just as much as shit as 64kbps.


So, what is it?"
,PsychopathicMetal08,2008-09-09T19:17Z,"Only song I like off this is The devil's Rejects, but it needs to be heavier...."
