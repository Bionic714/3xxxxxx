First upload, so let's see what happens...


Tuvalu is an early favourite of mine. The story takes place in a run down bath house, where Anton works as an assistent. The owner is blind, but his daughter is not, so as the building slowly falls apart Antons dream about sailing far away with Eva grows.
A fairytale set in an undefined country, where people communicates through gestures and sound. So no subtitles needed, even though there are a few blurbs of internationally known words. A feel good movie, but an interesting one of its kind with great visuals and good acting.

If anyone has other stuff by Veit Helmer I would love to see it.
