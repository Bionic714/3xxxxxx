Anyway you will notice when you watch it. Enjoy and remember to buy a real copy next time you need a gift. Amazon.de has it for next to nothing.

Thanks so much for this, it's a real treat. I agree about the visuals, and even the farcical special effects help carry the mood along.
No surprises, just a good old comedy western.
Amazing how much silence can do for a film ;)

But it's a terrific, fun and unique movie.  Thanks to the original poster.  Come on folks, help out and seed!  I've uploaded 6 gigs of this, so I know you're out there..."
