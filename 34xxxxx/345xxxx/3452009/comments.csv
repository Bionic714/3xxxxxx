,sparkmegikjeften,2006-03-07T17:19Z,Sweet! Just what i needed after another day at my crap job...
,k|nky,2006-03-16T21:43Z,"@KConny its unpacked because this is a public torrent site not a topsite! It also means people are more likely to continue seeding as they dont have a load of .rars that they just delete after unpacking.If you want your releases in scene format I suggest you get yourself some leech axx on a topsite, failing that you could maybe join a private torrent site."
