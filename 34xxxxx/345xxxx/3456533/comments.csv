,swolfy,2006-09-24T06:29Z,"Hi everyone downloading this, i am currently seeding. The files downloaded end with the extentsion .001 to .067. In order to extract these, i opened the .001 file with winRAR, worked like a charm, in win rar the file shows up as a 4.23gb file. i am currently extracting this file and will let you know if it works!"
,swolfy,2006-09-24T07:36Z,"Well, after it unrared and i took it out of the iso it was 3.7gb's. just enough to fit on the hard drive after i deleted all the emulators. it works great on an NTSC system. i havent gotten much past starting it up and playing a few missions, but thus far, no hiccups no problems. enjoy! thanks fourtweny, its your torrent, you can bitch at anyone you want to ( ;

P.S. Dizzamn theres alot of files in that game, took 3x longer to transfer it then any other game save the huge games like jade empire."
