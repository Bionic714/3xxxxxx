Catch em' live if you can!"
,jayzim17,2007-11-10T01:29Z,Can we possibly get this in another format other than WMA?
,slavetothesound,2008-04-25T01:28Z,"dont bitch about the format, it's lossless you nutfuck! you can convert it to anything you want with zero loss of quality after you've downloaded it."
,slavetothesound,2008-04-25T01:29Z,"oh, and thanks for the awesome album!"
,slavetothesound,2008-04-25T01:38Z,"Hell, since I prefer FLAC, too, I'll convert it and re-upload this in FLAC as soon as I'm done downloading."

,roscopp,2009-01-13T07:08Z,For the upload you rock as much as they do. Bought this album when it came out but lost the cd. much appreciated!!
,papablo,2010-07-01T21:00Z,"The complaint on WMA is because it's WMAv9, and there are no open-source decoders for the format yet.
Thanks anyway."
