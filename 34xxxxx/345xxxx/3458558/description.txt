1999 debut album from the black keys. Forget all this current watered-down blues-rock crap, these guys rip the blues as they were intended. Like the liner notes say: "Our medium-fi technique comes from combining equal parts hot-ass shit to equal parts broke-ass shit." Those who appreciate howlin wolf, elmore james, john lee hooker, otis rush, etc. need apply. WMA lossless
