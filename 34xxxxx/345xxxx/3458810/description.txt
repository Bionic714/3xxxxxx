An Epic album, very diffrent from the first. Travis Meeks has said that the first DOTN album was what the band wanted him to do, the 3rd was what the lable wanted him to do, and that the 2nd was what HE wanted to do. You can hear the Dead Can Dance influence on this one. Great textures and production. One of my favorites!
