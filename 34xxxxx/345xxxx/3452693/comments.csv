,shady78,2006-03-07T04:54Z,video enigma is an app that tricks your xboxs eprom into thinking its a pal or ntsc eprom you can get it from xbins or a torrent i can upload it if you like the only problem with it is your television has to support the other signal if you have a pal tv it has to support ntsc signal or you get a black and white screen
,borbafett,2006-03-07T06:55Z,"By the way, this is NOT Rocky Legends. It's the first Rocky game that game out in 2002. They're similar, but this is not Rocky Legends."
