,fr0ntl1n3,2006-04-11T01:19Z,abel33: what about wga and updates? tested and working??
,redhateve,2006-04-30T15:41Z,"I just download this torrent. 
This is how it goes:

One downloaded you need to unrar the 700mb file to your HDD. make sure you have sufficient room, as the unrarred file takes about 2300mb.

Once decompressed navigate to the ROOT directory. There you will find all 6 windows 2003 installs nicely in a row. 3 normal versions ( web server, standard server, enterprise server) and 3 volume versions. These volume versions do NOT require activation of any sort ( tested myself )

The keys delivered with the torrent work perfectly and I could not find any timebombs.

imho: excellent download. I'll be seeding this one on 100kb/s for the coming week or so.  "
,novmode,2006-05-12T21:40Z,does this have service pack1?  or has anyone who downloaded this successfuly installed sp1?
,andregcasal,2006-05-23T03:29Z,"Hi all! What is the diference between Normal and Volume versions, besides not needing activation?

Thanks in advance,

,the living hell,2006-07-03T20:12Z,"do i need to activate this??

,hard boiled,2006-11-17T15:24Z,Is anybody tried installing this? The installer says I'm missing over half dozen files.
,moonlightofdeath,2007-02-19T23:26Z,I've used the Datacenter VLK and it worked fine for me.  Try burning it again or adding only 2003 Datacenter VLK.  I can't speak for the other versions included.
