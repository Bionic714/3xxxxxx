,toddw,2006-03-22T09:51Z," Just a FYI, I had some trouble burning this with AL-120%__ no data reconized on disc__ and couldn't mount image with AL-120% either.

I ended up using MagicISO to extract the files from the .ISO to a folder and then ran the setup__ Demon tools works as well.

All in All I got it installed ;)

Thanks for the upload__T.W."
,draco7891,2006-03-23T08:19Z,Really? That's interesting. Which version of Alcohol are you using? It mounted and later burned just fine for me with 3823.
,toddw,2006-03-24T06:18Z,"@ draco7891__ Version 1.9.5 ( Build 3105 ) and burning with a Pioneer R100 DVD model# 110D,__ it's a fairly new drive out so that maybe the problem.

I have  (Build 3823)__ Just too damn lazy to install it.

Did you have RMPS (Recordable Media Physical 
Signature) Enable when you created the image 
by chance?

T.W."
,draco7891,2006-03-25T02:25Z,"Nope, no special settings. There's no protection on the disc, so it's not too picky about copying.

Oh well, as long as it works, right :)"
,toddw,2006-03-25T08:25Z,"@ draco7891___ Oh not a problem mate!__ it's working just fine__ I believe most of the problem is my cracked version of Alcohol 120__ I can't mount any image files, so I've downloaded the latest version from TPB, should take care of the problem.

Anyway Draco, the upload was greatly appreciated___ T.W. ;)"
,MCFC OK,2006-03-28T13:03Z,"I finally found this thanks m8!
I wonder if anyone has the DVD labels? Or would it be possible to scan and upload them? This would make the collection look perfect with full printed DVD's  :)
