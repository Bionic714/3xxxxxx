,whupp,2006-03-13T01:39Z,ka992 - if u don't want the vc and the resources it uses then it can be shut off via the ace config utility.
,zorgon34,2006-03-13T04:42Z,thanks a bunch for the upload but the captain sim is the only really nice detailed add-on i know where you have to ctrl+e to get it started.  thats really really lame on their part.  they didnt spend too much time on the operation of the plane.

,jabbaru,2006-03-14T09:13Z,"everyone is asking for Block A when according to the Capt' sim website A is included in B.

""Please do not buy 'Block A' if you are going to buy 'Block B', because the 'Block A' is included into the 'Block B'. """

Please anyone of you guys can reseed the mdmax?"
,Alpha422,2006-03-15T23:01Z,"Thanks, Will seed for abit"
,BlackBug,2006-03-16T07:51Z,"This package doesnt have a 'panel'. Quite contrary to what CaptainSim or the Pirates at TPB may say. Infact aliasing this a/c to any other panel puts the plane in some kind of ""maintenance mode"". Here the engine cowling is open, flaps down and the gear absent all together. It happened with me. I had used FlightSim Manager to do it. So I believe we need an authentic panel for this bird or a proper way to add a third party panel."
,FSDude,2006-03-16T18:05Z,"Simply aliasing the panel will definitly not work. You need to copy the contents of the panel you want to use, such as the LevelD, into the panel folder. Then copy the .air file and aircraft.cfg. Then copy the contact points and light section from the original Captain Sim aircraft.cfg to your new one. Readd your liveries and it should work. Not easy, but possible."
,BlackBug,2006-03-16T19:14Z,"I admit my mistake people. Yeah, a person CAN add a 3rd party panel to this a/c. But, as rightly pointed out by FSDude, it is not easy. But possible for sure. Happy flying."
,A10inbound,2006-03-24T14:42Z,"i am looking for the captain sim L-39, i love the L-39 and i know they stopped selling it, if anyone could put that up that would be greatly appreciated.
