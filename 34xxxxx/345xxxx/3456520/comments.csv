,NS-Chaos,2006-05-19T07:12Z,My 1st torrent =)
,daraptor0,2006-05-20T20:20Z,"Ok, to fix the ""wrong cd"" thing, get the auto play to display, then click ""reinstail"", then ""repair"". It will then ask you if you want to use the new files or the old files, ""select yes to all"". When it finshes you'll be able to play it again.

But when you go to play online it says invalid cd key :O, whats the original cd key?"
,Scruffy75,2006-07-22T23:00Z,Would be cool if someone could seed a little. Thanks.

,Dupont60,2006-09-04T14:30Z,"Lol, people said that they had fast downloads...

ROFL


Yellow smiley and only 4 days left on my download, wow that's very fast!"
,Dupont60,2006-09-04T19:01Z,"Jodå, singelplayer fungerar finfint.

Men Multiplayer går inte.
Provade att ta repair, reinstall, men när jag då startar om Halo och ska köra multiplayer så säger ju programmet att en uppdatering hittats och om jag inte kör den så kan jag inte spela multiplayer.
Men då intstalleras ju skiten igen, och då är jag tillbaka på ruta 1!!!
HJÄLP SNÄLLA!!"
,Dupont60,2006-09-04T20:28Z,"Problemet för mig nu är att det går visserligen utmärkt att joina servrar men om jag ska starta en egen bana, så kommer Invalid CD Key meddelandet upp igen.
Helvetes skit! Vad är problemet?"

,Casmus,2006-10-02T08:08Z,I don't think you're able to play on Multiplayer... :(
,elKageboy,2006-10-02T09:26Z,"Well, it seems as if some got it to work...but no one will help elKageboy:(..."
,CoLLecToR 91,2006-10-19T15:22Z,"Noobs!
The reason u cant play online is because your CD-Key is NOT VALID.
To get a valid one, spend $ 20 on this game like I did.
Have a nice day."
,d boy,2006-10-31T12:38Z,cud any1 help me wot do i use to download this
,R@B,2006-11-04T00:49Z,"lol Collector ur a n00b cuz u don't know how we ""noobs"" get the nocd thing so we CAN play online suck on that n00bcaek"
,CoLLecToR 91,2006-11-18T16:45Z,"R@B, there is no way of using a NoCD Crack and play online.
They have an update.
The crack no longer works online.

So, whos the noob now?"
,ecksray,2006-11-19T05:26Z,"Your the one who took the time to look UP the torrent, and is now argueing over the internet. So people dont want to pay 20$, big deal. Let them."
,halo84748,2006-11-25T06:03Z,"Ur stupid  CoLLecToR 91, along with others who payed $20 for this game.

To everybody else, take that $20 and buy ur mom some flowers or save it for something important. If you really want to play the game,
and need valid halo key to play online, here you go:

MVHTG-6WGHK-2VWM2-29JQ6-6GFYM

Its my key, I paid $1.99 for it. I don't like the game, so you can have it.

REGISTER THE KEY ON MICROSOFT WEBSITE AS SOON AS YOU INSTALL THE GAME!!! That way if too many people use it and it stops working, Microsoft will give you a new one ;-)

Have fun!!!"

,Idjott,2007-07-11T13:21Z,"if you want to play multiplayer, all it takes is a some brain, wich some of you guys dont seem to have... for those who dont have a brain heres what you do:1.
 install halo with a correct cd key (provided by halo84748 at page 2 of the comments). 
2.enter your halo folder and copy the file called halo.exe, paste it in a differnent  folder.
3. start halo and enter multiplayer, download the uppdate, exit halo.
4. replace your current halo.exe file with the one you copied earlier.
and you are done!"
