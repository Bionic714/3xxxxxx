,kernelcrispychicken,2009-08-09T13:03Z,"Are the subs really burned in? A lot of people claim that when they don't know about .srt (or .sub) files, and this torrent includes them for different languages, so I'm doubtful."
,AnotherStranger,2010-09-23T17:59Z,"I can confirm this piece of shit contains hardburned Spanish subs, can't believe people are still seeding it...
