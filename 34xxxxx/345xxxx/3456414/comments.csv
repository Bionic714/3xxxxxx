,cfg2606,2006-03-13T15:21Z,block A would be great if someone can .... just for those people that have not the highest resources on their PC to run a VC ... ;-)
,pilot013,2006-03-13T18:22Z,"Just to tell you,that you could disable the VC by the ACE utility in the CapSim B-757 pack.

The crack for the packages is working for this too..So just download the installer and you are ready!"
