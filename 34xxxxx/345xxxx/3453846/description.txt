This short, easy to read satirical novel tells the story of Farmer Jones, who at the start of the story lives happily on his farm in Helgoland - which is currently at war with the Mungos in Mungoland - with his wife Mrs Jones, who is content to be a dab hand at cooking, sewing and cleaning until "the feminals" come to town. As his life starts to fall apart, and his wife falls under the influence of the feminals, he ends up alone drinking in the Red Bull Tavern where he meets Brother Dogworthy, who is a member of the Helgoland underground Resistance movement who seek to get their wives, farms and jobs back that have been robbed from them by the feminals and their blonde cropped haired, stocky leader, the "Grand Dragoness", Ann Winters. Things are even worse for Jones however, as Helgoland is already under the spell of its first feminal prime minister, Margaret Bodger, who has closed all of Helgoland's industry down and transferred it to the slave labour camps in the far away Bongolands. Will Jones and Dogworthy manage to save their wives, lives and their country from the evil feminals? And if so, how?
