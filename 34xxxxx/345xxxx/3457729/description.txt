short flick showing the end of the fight between pramuk and jomhod on feb 18 2006 in sweden. this is probably filmed with a mobilephone camera or something similar, so go figure about the quality.this one's for the hardcore fans of muay thai, for someone wanting good quality as a priority, skip this one, it's filmed from a bit of a distance too. I'm sharing it so that the hardcore fans can get a taste.
