In the booklet a 1976 quote from Klaus Schulze is reprinted where he describes 'Moondawn' as an excursion into rock music. If taken seriously, he can only have meant something like "played in the rock spirit" because musically it isn't rock at all but instead typical Schulze, although to be fair, it's certainly more rock-like than predecessor 'Timewind'.
The original LP release consisted of the first two tracks to which this 1995 rerelease adds additional material from the same sessions with Harald Grosskopf, who'd become the next Ashra drummer (as Schulze had been some years earlier).
'Floating', after a slow intro (blessed by the Pope of all people - typical piece of Schulze humour), settles into a jazzy groove with Schulze and Grosskopf improvising their stuff around a basic two-chord figure - a splendid piece which is basically an extended jam-session.
'Mindphaser' also has a slow intro on keyboards only, setting up a beautiful tranquil atmosphere, sort of silence before the storm. Now and then some far away storm effects can in fact be heard before the storm arrives in full when suddenly Schulze's organ and Grosskopf's drums take off to bring the piece to a conclusion with another lively jam-session.
'Supplement' ends with a slightly different version of the organ section from 'Mindphaser' - before that we hear Schulze experimenting around with atmospheric and purely electronic effects.An energetic album: rock 'n roll the Schulze way, I suppose.
