,marthe83,2006-03-17T15:38Z,Anyone know if more seasons is awaileable somewhere?
,rs04,2006-03-17T18:27Z,"I will release season 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8"
,Deznaj,2006-03-18T21:00Z,"Just like the season 1 upload, this season is a mess...

The upside: all episodes are here (unlike season 1 where two where missing).

The downsides: episode 212 (Net Prophet) has the wrong audio track, namely comments of the actors/director. 

Also, the episode listing is incorrect:

205 = 208 - Dire Strayts
207 = 205 - Tube Steak
208 = 207 - Getaway
209 = 210 - Roamin' Holiday
210 = 209 - I, Candy
213 = 214 - Block Buster
214 = 215 - Frozen Pop
215 = 213 - Party Favor
217 = 218 - The Shmenkmans
218 = 217 - Meet By-Product
219 = 220 - Wild Cards
220 = 219 - Suprise Artie
224 = 225 - Whine Country
225 = 224 - Flower Power
