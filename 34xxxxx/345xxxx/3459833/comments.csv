1.) It's pretty small.
2.) It's a good classic which deserves to be kept alive.
3.) IT'S STAR TREK, DAMNIT!"
,IceMaster,2006-03-20T16:47Z,"I used to play this game on my old Acer computer back in the day, 100MHz Pentium, 16MB RAM, etc.  I could never finish the game though because my disc 5 was a misprint."
