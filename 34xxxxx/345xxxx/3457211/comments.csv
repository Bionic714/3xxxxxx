,svabi,2006-03-26T09:38Z,"Play it with VLC, http://www.videolan.org/vlc/ 
then --> Audio --> Audio Tracks --> Track 2"
,Lutuinen Hombre,2006-03-27T22:28Z,"can this (changing the audio track) be done with Media Player, becouse VLC SUCKS HUGE ARSE"
,Dark_Scythe7,2006-03-28T00:47Z,"windows media player i would say sucks more arse than vlc, but to my knowledge, no you cannot change language on windows media player...

i was wondering if there was a program to burn this to play in my dvd player but only burn it in english?

thanks for the help though, vlc works great!"
