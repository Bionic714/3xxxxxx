Found one more, this time it┬┤s the IANTD OW Manual in .pdf
If anyone has access to diving manuals, please upload! PADI, NAUI, IANTD... even DSAT!
I┬┤m especially looking for the PADI Digital Specialty Instructor Manual, do you have it?

And now, a few words from our sponsor:
I have noticed that Farcry (Myth and Deviance releases) does not work with newer drivers from ati, why? does anyone else have this problem? How can I solve it? I would like newer drivers, but I would also like my favourite game to work :(

Does anyone have "Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within" as DVD-iso? Please upload if so!
