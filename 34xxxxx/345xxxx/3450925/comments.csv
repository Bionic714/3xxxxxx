,T_A_G,2006-03-01T19:59Z,what is the plot in this movie?
,krazydanny,2006-03-01T20:53Z,"3 backpackers are in Amsterdam where they get locked out of their youth hostel. they are invited into a mans house where he tells them of a hostel somewhere in eastern Europe where the women are all incredibly hot and have a taste for American men. when they get there everything is so to good to be true the hostel is ""to die for"""
,Gwar,2006-03-01T21:57Z,"Yeah Finaly, I start download this movie.

,Gwar,2006-03-01T21:58Z,hmm fan skriver jag
,rauz,2006-03-01T22:29Z,"This is not a DVD Screener, looks like crap...maybe it's just the VHS Screener all over again.

You've been warned."
,Greg_dog,2006-03-02T02:09Z,"ok,what kind of quality? DVDSCR???"
,cyabro,2006-03-02T03:01Z,I just downloaded the sample and it looks pretty good.
,rauz,2006-03-02T03:38Z,"I downloaded the whole movie and it's not good, trust me. Try the Hydro release instead. This one went straight into the Recycle Bin, unwatched."
,sn43,2006-03-02T04:06Z,Its the same source as Hydros SVCD...
,rauz,2006-03-02T04:08Z,"Well then steer clear of Hydro's release too. I just said try it...not sure how it is. All I know is that this is one of the worst dvd screeners I've seen in a while and I will wait until someone does it better, eod."
,Laen,2006-03-02T04:54Z,"On the brighter side, the not so good quality saves you a too good view of hanging eyes and such."
,skribb,2006-03-02T15:53Z,"Laen: Well, then why are you downloading this movie? If you don't like gore?"
,Fredde_23,2006-03-02T16:39Z,"They are all lyares, who thinks this quality sucks and thinks its a vhsscreener. 
The truth is this is realy goody pitcure, and its a DVDScr.
I dont like liars omg they are ruining for each other."
,Fredde_23,2006-03-02T16:40Z,"And this is not a re encoded from Hydro.
LLG and HYdRO are difernet sources.
HYdROs is nuked."

,rauz,2006-03-03T17:47Z,"Fredde_23, you need to see a therapist or take anger management classes because when someone starts caring this much about a row of 1's and 0's - something's not right.

I stand by what I said though - this might be a dvd screener but the quality is still crap."
,slimfb,2006-03-03T18:29Z,"hi guys, v new 2 this torrent stuff, just got hostel & now seeding - what do i do now with all the files - want 2 burn on a dvd etc...cheers"

,qwerewq,2006-03-05T03:42Z,phaz i know that feeling! only i spent the money for a ticket and walked out after 50 minutes ._.
,rikardpah,2006-03-05T07:56Z,"rauz, state the fact that the quality of downloaded movies is N O T a colectible item, its something u use to waste a couple of hours of ur life and the quality IS good enough for this, u might be one of these superdatanerds whos only life is in front of the screen, creating stories and lyin to other people online just beacuse u dont have a life ur self... as I said earlier, GET A FUCNKIN LIFE MAN!!!"
,jakerkladhest,2006-03-05T09:00Z,jag vill ha text!!! svensk alltså!
,rauz,2006-03-05T10:07Z,"rikardpah, none of the above. I'm just saying the quality is severly lacking for being a DVD screener. Take it or leave it. Why should I lie about this fact? It's the opposite - I'm just saying people should wait for a better release. But it seems this movie is so bad it's not even worth downloading a real dvd rip. And as I said - check the big releasesites - I'm not the only one thinking the quality sucks. Big deal."
,rikardpah,2006-03-05T11:57Z,"True, true, really bad movie, but the quality is ok, totally watchable, only thing being the the sound is just a little out of sync in the middle.
In fact this movie sucked so bigtime, I want my 1,5 hour back..."
,Fredde_23,2006-03-05T14:11Z,"THIS  FILM IS MADE BY BAD QUALITY.
SO YOU CANT BELIVE THE DVDSCR SHOULD BE LIKE A DVDRIP. BUT I PROMISE YOU WHEN THIS MOVIE COMES OUT IN A DVDRIP THE QUALITY IS THE SAME AS THE DVDSCR.
BEACUASE THIS FILM IS MADE IN BAD QUALITY,
THIS FILM IS Made so.
People who havent download this im saying only one thing: THIS IS THE BEST QUALITY OUT, ITS A REAL DVDSCR, THE PITCURE IS GREAT AND SOUND TO. If you like this movie you shouldent wait for a dvdrip becuase this is dvdquality."
,Rikk727,2006-03-05T21:41Z,How do you save this to a disk after you unpack it? 
,gman12,2006-03-06T10:27Z,i downloaded this from www.araditracker.com and got my max download 164k constant. i hate slow downloads we need more seeders you dam leechers

[V],NessseN,2006-03-08T08:42Z,"This one aint close to a dvdscr.. Sorry folks, fake and nuked."
,lil_jon,2006-03-08T11:35Z,"As a dvdscr the quality is rather low. The film itself sucks so f*ckin much. If you want to waste your bandwidth and time, go ahead and download this crap. I regret I did."
,majinsoftware,2006-03-08T12:06Z,awsome movie too bad the web site for the gange doesnt work im keen to buy some american's

,pisekfvoljanet,2006-03-09T18:07Z,"sick, but I loved it"
,Eibon666,2006-03-09T18:21Z,"This is for sure the DVD Screener, Picture is great, allthough the movie was shot with a greyish look, don`t let this fool you. The sound was a little bit low, but just crank it up. And to the people who keep insisting this is a CAM release, i doubt the the person who released this file would bother to run ""Property of Lions Gate Films"" over the screen a couple of times during the movie. Watch the whole damn thing before you post such ridicilous comments!"
,sadoues,2006-03-09T18:37Z,seed please :)
,willhaigh,2006-03-09T21:11Z,This is an ok quality DVDSCR but you just need to turn the brightness up abit when watching because you wont see much in the dark scenes. It is a great film.
,multii,2006-03-09T22:20Z,Very sick and good movie... good quality
,rauz,2006-03-10T05:03Z,"I never said it wasn't a dvd screener...I just the quality sucked :)

Besides, I don't think the movie companies would employ people to also upload their own illegal torrents to the sites. I sure as hell wouldn't if I was trying to fool people into downloading this pos.
But anywho, there's a better dvdr version out now so case closed imho."
,norther,2006-03-11T10:54Z,jag är lite noob.. jag får itne igång filerna.. vad ska jag spela den med?

,praise,2006-03-18T11:47Z,"NO this is NOT the new Tarantino. In this movie Tarantino is Co-Producer and NOTHING else, which means that he has NOTHING to do with the direction of the movie.

...and if you see it you will easily find out why. It STINKS!!!   "
