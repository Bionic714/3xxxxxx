This is all the stuff off of my original win95 disk - and i mean the original - not the upgrade ones. There's also a tiny bit of stuff off of the original win98 disk too. These are all video promos - and a few of them you would possibly have seen on your TV way back in 1996. Nostaligic nonsense. I love old TV myself...I personally like the old Charlie Says videos. If any one has any of them to share please let me know...........CHARLIE SAYS DON'T PLAY WITH MATCHES MEEEEEOWWWWWWWWWWW! (GULPS FISH WHOLE AND LEAVES  BONE REMAINING)
