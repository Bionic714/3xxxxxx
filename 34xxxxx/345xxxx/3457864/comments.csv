Now, if I can only find some SEEDERS!"
,madness27,2008-05-21T08:06Z,I dunno if Wolf actually had a drinking problem. Im pretty educated. Never read or heard about that. And he was not a psycho. But anyways...we love him and thats what matters. So thanks. xx

,iccyhot,2009-12-18T07:22Z,"I'm highly skeptical of what the poster says about Wolf also.

""It is part of the legend that Muddy was nice, Howlin' was scary, and they disliked each other. In the film, they are guarded but civil, and fierce competitors. Walker plays the 6-foot-4 Wolf as a scowler who somehow from that height looks up at people under hooded eyes and appears willing to slice you just for the convenience. The real Howlin' Wolf must have been more complex; he couldn't read or write until he was past 40, but then he earned his high school equivalency diploma and studied accounting, an excellent subject for an associate of Leonard Chess.""  --Roger Ebert"
