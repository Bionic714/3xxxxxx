A good collection of Howlin Wolfs best songs in mp3 format.
Howlin Wolf was one of the most influential blues artists ever to exist (inspiring The Doors, Rolling Stones, Eric Clapton, Tom Waits among others). He was a big psycho with a drinking problem famous for scaring the shit out of everybody. In my book his the best bluesman ever, simply because no artist has ever matched his voice in cruelness and whiskeydrenched bluesiness. If you like blues you like Howlin Wolf. If you like music you like Howlin Wolf.
