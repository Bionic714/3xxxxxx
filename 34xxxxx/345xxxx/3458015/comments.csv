,wespace,2008-03-21T22:38Z,"The MD5=DC4ABABCC272F8F43EBEE12383BFDB0E

It has no passwords (why would anybody use passwords anyway for a public torrent?), use winrar to unpack. I used DiamondCS MD5 to calculate the MD5 and all looks fine te me. "

BTW, did you ever find those DVDs?"
,mvanarey,2009-03-15T07:09Z,"I have the DVD CD's, but have no clue how to get them up on here. TBH the information they talk about on the DVDs are nothing more than a talk-show like version of the information you can get free from the CBOE website."
