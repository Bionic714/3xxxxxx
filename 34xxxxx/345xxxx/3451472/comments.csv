I don't really know if the 1.1 version works on the cracked thingie tho.. try! It didn't work for me at least! Anyone who knows how to install the patch? I get like ""Necessary securitymodule cannot be found. The game could not be launched"" or something like it. Thanks"

,Toxidragon199,2010-03-19T11:53Z,"Can some one please seed at least one more seed?
uTorrent is not connecting to the ONLY seed.. somebody please seed?
P.S. i'll be seeding too"
,Toxidragon199,2010-03-19T11:55Z,"oh and
@brainorora
this is a no CD crack, when you install the ""Illegal"" Crashday on your PC, it will ask you to put the CD, and it will that the CD is wrong, so this Crack is used to make the game run without the CD."
