,fullmaster,2007-09-17T09:10Z,"Hey, could I get just a little bit seeding? I'm stuck in 95% and need only 20MB to complete it, it won't take more than a few minutes. 10X in advance for the seeding and the torrent!"
,SketcHDawG,2010-02-12T04:44Z,"YoYo. It would be a shame to see this one die. VLC has un- broken this enough to see that there are quality sets in here. With 6 generous peers, all stuck at 95%, I'm sure if someone could find a tracker with a 100% file, this torrent would stay alive for many more years to come. I have searched high and low for this elusive tracker, but no luck. Plse babyjr, can you jump back on this for a couple of hours? "
