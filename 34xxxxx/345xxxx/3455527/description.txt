Magnum's "Vigilante" is their most commercial sounding album, and it might as well be their finest effort ever. Some would say it's time typical and some will say that it has little in common with the early Magnum. Well, that might be the case but the fact is that this album is very good - strong material, well performed and well produced. Magnum deliver quality rock with a lot of melody from the start to the end. You get rockers as well as ballads, and Magnum have not included a single filler on this solid album. Highly recommended!
