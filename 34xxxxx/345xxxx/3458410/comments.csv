I am using this on my Win XP SP 2
it runs without DOS emulators
if you wish 
use DOS Box
soon I'll upload patches, cheats and a lot of info
for this
"
,usmiv4o,2006-04-15T17:58Z,"P.S. this not need instal just unzip in some folder and run Xcomapocal.exe

its true it runs in DOS but Win XP has something like DOS and its works"

are files to cheat UFO 3 Appocalipse

they are small but with them you can cheat and make money, weapons, research and many many more

how about to edit you crafts and to have 10000 defence?
maybe you units to have 100 Accuracy or
100 Reactions...

there are and manuals about UFO 3

Enjoi it..."
