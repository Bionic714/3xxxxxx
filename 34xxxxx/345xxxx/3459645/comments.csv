,xboxerstuart,2006-03-19T17:47Z,gas giver....im having problems using the emulators...says cannot load information??? any ideas??? the rest of the disc is shit hot!!!!!now i can play fight night 3!!
,GasGiver4711,2006-03-19T17:54Z,"xboxerstuart: Emulators, Fight Night ??? This is just XBMC, nothing more nothing less - i dunno what you´re talking about, sorry."
,shloader,2006-03-20T05:04Z,"You included scripts... YES!. er... 

But anyway it's nice when someone includes the python engine in their release. Clean2K5's didn't and for some reason after I tried adding it all back in it would play 1 second of any streaming vid from Flexi and just lock the box. Your release could be my salvation as a lot of end users I help out want that feature working."

,oddball69,2006-03-21T13:06Z,"Hi Gasgiver. 

Been using your releases since last year, and they 
are working great, no problems ever so far......

But ( and this is the only problem i ever had) 
with this last release the scripts dosn't work. 
Nothing happens when i select script menu. 

I'm using Pal 16:9 Project Mayhem III

Any thoughts, bits pieces or ide's ????"
,Manzzon,2006-03-21T20:21Z,Latest stupidvideos script would be nice too se included for the next release. :)
,GasGiver4711,2006-03-22T02:16Z,"Manzzon: Yep, i am missing this myself since the old one didnt work anymore - but atm ppl (including myself) still have probs with the new one - it hangs everytime after playing a video, only a restart helps to get out - besides that the script is looking VERY promising and works nice - so im gonna wait till this gets ironed out ... next release will have the new version of submenuedit though - if anyone cares ;-)"
,Manzzon,2006-03-22T14:31Z,"GasGiver4711: Yeah it looked ALOT better than the last one I tried, im running 720P so it looked even worse than normal. Hope they get it more stable very soon... ;)"
,Gouke,2006-03-22T21:07Z,Thanks man!
,Bruket,2006-03-26T13:25Z,"Tackar GasGiver, som vanligt en bra ""version"" !!
