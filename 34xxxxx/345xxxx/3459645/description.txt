   SKINS INCLUDED:

   Original Project Mayhem III Skin from CVS only.
   It guarantees everything works perfectly and keeps Releases Small & Clean.
   This skin is constantly changed and updated. I you want to use other skins,
   make sure they are suitable for this particular CVS Version of XBMC.
   Don┬┤t ask me about problems with 3rd Party Skins - You┬┤re on your own here !

   I replaced the Original with the Project Mayhem III Style Webserver Interface
   from KanadaKid (Scott). Looks very nice ┬┤coz it perfectly fits the PM3 style.
   
   Added Weather Display to Home Screen (visible only with Internet connection)
   It displays the currently selected city from the Weather menu.

   ABOUT TRAINERS:

   There are 539 Trainers included to give you a good start.

   all (binary) dupes. I absolutely don┬┤t know which ones work and which don┬┤t ! 
   PLEASE do not ask me anything about the included Trainers.

   Trainer files need to be in /system/Trainers - Use the context menu on a Game
   listed in MY PROGRAMS to refresh the Trainer List or to change Trainer options. 

   Get Trainers e.g. @ http://trainers.maxconsole.net (Free Registration required)

   TROUBLESHOOTING TIPS:

   If you are experiencing all kinda weird problems using an updated version
   of XBMC it is always a good idea to delete the XBMC┬┤s "SaveGame"
   using the Micro$oft Dashboard.
   Alternatively, just delete the E:/TDATA/0face008 and E:/UDATA/0face008 dirs.
   This is especially important if you are updating from quite an old version.

   To avoid problems you should also check - with every new release - 
   if the included XboxMediaCenter.xml has been changed significantly.
   You should then update your own customized XboxMediaCenter.xml accordingly.

   If using XBMC as Dashboard, don┬┤t forget to update the files on DRIVE ┬┤C┬┤.
