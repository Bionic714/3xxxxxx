,piratebill,2006-03-18T20:55Z,"For the benefit of those who may be confused by the lack of stats here, at last count I registered 60 seeds on my bittorrent client, so there shouldn't be any difficult downloading this for quite some time."
,demonbeast,2006-03-19T13:57Z,"Thanks PB.

And yes, plenty of seeds here..."
,piratebill,2006-03-19T18:53Z,Stats working again ok - many thanks to the technical wizards at Pirate Bay for sorting out the glitch.
,piratebill,2006-03-20T16:58Z,"Many thanks for the support Ksoktogon, but it does seem a little unfair on other torrent posters on the site to be running the same torrent in two locations via a repost. So what do you want to do. I could take this down and leave yours up if you wish?"
,ksoktogon,2006-03-20T21:27Z,"I do apologise, but because of the site's technical problems it was not clear in the beginning that this torrent is already running here. Perhaps the second torrent is 'stronger' due to the 4 backup trackers. (As far as I know, once you've uploaded a torrent you cannot take it down. MININOVA users are still using the first one, so perhaps it's worth uploading the second one on MININOVA again, it would bring new visitors.) On the other hand, now the problem on PIRATEBAY seems to be the lack of direct search i.e. if you type some of the key words into the search window, you still cannot reach the file. "
,piratebill,2006-03-20T22:21Z,"No apology required Ksoktogon, actually we are glad you have raised this matter in regard to Sam's works, so we can say generally we would rather readers did not trouble to post Sam's works on any other torrent site, as there is a danger that multiple postings could just offend people, and may bring Sam and his works into disrepute."
,ksoktogon,2006-03-20T22:48Z,Thanks for the info. I have deleted the torrent.
,piratebill,2006-03-20T23:18Z,"Thanks Ksogtogon. Sam feels it's best that people concentrate on benefitting from the material themselves, rather than worrying about telling the world, what for many, they may not be ready for. "
,piratebill,2006-10-08T15:56Z,"All Sam Fryman's works to Sept 2006 are available at

,piratebill,2006-10-29T17:46Z,"CORRECTION all Sam Fryman's works will be kept available on an ongoing basis via the link in the description on torrent

,enjoyeverymoment,2011-12-22T18:57Z,"22/12/11 the COMPLETE works are being seeded right now. I decided to seed it all instead of just individual ones because I believe seeding the whole collection will allow everyone will be able to get the pdf they are looking for and keep it all in one organised, easy to search, easy to seed torrent. http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6905797/Sam_Fryman_Complete_Works_Nov_2011_PDF_E-Book"
