,blumppin12,2008-07-21T16:57Z," you must be fuckin idiot if you download this shit. This thing is a total SCAM!! If you are unsure about this, then go to this and find this for yourself:

http://www.johntreed.com/Kiyosaki.html

IF YOU DOWNLOAD OR MOST DANGEROUS USE THE METHODS FROM THESE SHIT, THEN YOU MUST BE AN IDIOT. LET ME REPEAT,THIS BOOK IS A TOTAL SCAM...!!! DO NOT USE AND WASTE YOUR TIME!!! GO TO THE ABOVE LINK AND SEE IT FOR YOURSELF NOW!!!!!!!"
,longrange,2008-12-04T09:37Z,"Don't download this. 18 minutes of very poor quality video with very very noisy audio.
Also Kiyosaki should only be taken as a motivational speaker, reminding us the way many people live their lives based on ""secure jobs"", is forsaking the chance to be ""crazy rich"" one day. The so called financial intelligence should be learned from real books (like the ones McGraw Hill issues) and everyone should decide the level of target income and related risks for themselves, in their life."

,highlander777,2011-01-20T16:30Z,"I agree. This whole Kiyosaki thing is a scam!

I wish the web more developed back in he 90s when I bought and read *4* Kiyosaki's books and not really learning anything! KIyosaki is a good story teller but in 4 books, he doesn't tell you the ""meat"" on how he made his money. Ha makes allusions to owning real estate but nothing concrete that you can use!

When all his books point to his website, you may conclude he only makes money selling his books that go nowhere and provide no useable information. You will not be any richer or wiser by reading his books. In fact, the whole thing was a waste of my time and money!

,jdesignjames,2011-04-13T10:57Z,"Why are you people wasting your time on pulling others down. I just saw Kiyosaki speak and met him. He means good for others and he obviously found a way out of the 'rat race', at least he's showing others how to do it. Of course he won't tell you every detail because every one will use what he says and USE it in they're own original ways. 
Do your research before saying it's a scam. I've also read his books and because of him, I found many, many more ways to get further in my success. 
Losers try and bring the people who are doing something with their lives down. Ever hear the ""Crab-pot theory""? 
Quit being crabs and go talk negative elsewhere. 
Thanks for the upload Oakley"
