a much more interesting read, read a little about the insane ""intellectuals"" that inspire idiots like the writer below.

Their ilk very well captured in this illustration

,vper1,2006-03-20T22:33Z,Charles: Why do you hate America?
,oq242,2006-03-21T06:44Z,"who the hell said I hated america?  I love freedom, liberty, prosperity, and happiness for all.

I hate those that stomp all over the aforementioned in the name of the same.  I am critical of all politicians and leaders, regardless of political party, social status, sexual orientation, religious affiliation, etc etc etc."
,oq242,2006-03-21T06:46Z,"Those that abridge liberty are the enemy of me and my ilk.  America was created as the free world, the symbol of individual freedom and opportunity.

I have no problem with America, quite the opposite, I have a problem with those that are destroying it while spitting words like liberty, democracy, and freedom while waving the American flag."
