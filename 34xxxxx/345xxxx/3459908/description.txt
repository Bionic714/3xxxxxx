Terrorist Surveillance Act of 2006 (DRAFT)

This is a draft of the soon to be released Senate legislation which would 
legalize the Bush administration's illegal spying program.  Also, it would 
make it a crime to reveal government wrongdoing.  Whistleblowing now a crime.

From the link below, it "would add to the criminal penalties for anyone who 
'intentionally discloses information identifying or describing' the Bush 
administration's terrorist surveillance program or any other eavesdropping 
program conducted under a 1978 surveillance law. Under the boosted penalties, 
those found guilty could face fines of up to $1 million, 15 years in jail or 
both."

LEGISLATION SHOULD BE AVAILABLE TO ALL BEFORE RELEASED AND VOTED ON IN 
CONGRESS SO BAD LEGISLATION CANNOT BE SLIPPED IN.

So read it for yourself.
