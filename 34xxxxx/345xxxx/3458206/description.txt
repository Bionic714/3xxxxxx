Hey all

I completed the track, there are three different versions in three different file formats.

WAV, FLAC, and MP3 (320) Are the formats

Mix 1 - Wide mix
Mix 2 - Half Vocal Center mix
Mix 3 - Center Vocal mix

Enjoy this update!

After months of practice, I was
able to sync up two separate
versions of the song.

The red album (greatest hits)
version, and the record (LP)
version from the Rarities
album.

After extracting the vocals and
instrumental tracks from the
vinyl LP version, I sync'd it
with the red album version using
DSS DJ.

That's about it. It should be
ready finally. There are three
versions, wide, half center vocal
and center vocal mix.

Enjoy
