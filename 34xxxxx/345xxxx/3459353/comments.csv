,"Sgt, Pepper",2006-03-19T01:37Z,please seed this mothafucka!
,Rooten McFlooten,2006-03-19T08:46Z,"PS There is another version of this game on here now, I assume its the riot version although the person hasnt bothered to name them, you may initially get it faster there because frankly my upload is shit.

Anyway, the little turdburglar decided to suggest in his NFO that I had merely renamed the rar files from the RIOT realease and my torrent is somehow inferior. I did NOT do that, that would be pointless and I always give credit where its due. so there you go.
