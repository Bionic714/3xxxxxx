This is reportedly the best recorded version of Turandot.  I am going to attempt to download; however, have reservations regarding quality given the file sizes.  We'll See!"

,OrpheusDude,2011-03-21T00:03Z,"Sorry, but Joan Sutherland was never a Turandot: she sang it only once for this recording, and the role just doesn't suit her voice.  You need to seek out the EMI recordings with Birgit Nilsson, Franco Corelli and Renata Scotto (conducted by Francesco Molinari Pradelli) or the earlier RCA recording with Nilsson, Jussi Bjoerling and Anna Moffo.  Those are the hallmarks for this opera.  This Decca recording was just done as a showcase for Pavarotti (and a test for Sutherland)."
