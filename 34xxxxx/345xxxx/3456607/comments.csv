,bredes,2006-03-12T20:06Z,"It looks like there is a virus-war going on here on TPB. There has been several warning against Makkenas torrents before here, so i guess this is just a payback from him. I will dl it and check it out with F-secure, and write back here again if i find some virus or not. "
,soya505,2006-03-12T20:11Z,"Hehe Ok, i hate when people writes its a virus"
,bredes,2006-03-12T20:27Z,"There is NOT a virus in this torrent.

I dl it and scanned it with F-Secure and it did NOT find any viruses at all.

Makkena: shame on you and go hang your self!!!!!!"
