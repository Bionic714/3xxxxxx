Les Wilson is one of the UK's best blues guitarists - having established the Houserockers in 1981 - the band is well known in the UK and Europe, and enjoyed a 3rd headline spot at  the British Blues Festival at Colne 2004 . The Houserockers perform frequently in Holland and Belgium , for example ,  headlining the Drijf-In blues festival - Giethoorn in Holland August 2005 & the Luxembourg Jazz & Blues festival 2004. Les is one of the great slide guitarists in the high-energy style of George Thorogood /Hound Dog Taylor /Elmore James/Sonny Landreth - without the slide its Buddy Guy/Son Seals/ BB.King , Albert King/ The Fabulous Thunderbirds  and much more . Les prides himself on excellent choice of material - you will hear unusual blues songs that you will remember long after the show.
