,Dickey-Fuller,2006-03-10T22:15Z,"This program is also available at: 
http://scott.binrock.net/VWTOOL/

It's old though, from 1999. I think the author of the program passed away."
,Grim Reape速!!!,2006-03-10T22:28Z,It's the diagnostics program but it needs the old type serial interface cable

,Dickey-Fuller,2006-03-12T20:32Z,"I've tried this program on my VW Sharan 1999 with an USB cable. I think it works like a serial cable although its an USB. Here's a link to a seller of this cable in Norway: http://www.finn.no/finn/bap/object?finnkode=7031690&sid=9azmaIEEH227029&pos=1&tot=2 

Here's an other link for a similar product in USA:

This program is an alternative to VAG-COM from Ross-Tech. You can read the fault codes that your car stores in the control module. You can also do a lot of stuff that I know nothing about. I'm just using it to find fault codes and broken components.
-Good luck"
