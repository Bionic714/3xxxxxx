The main/major language in China is ""Mandarin"", which 850 million people speak. If you're looking to learn Mandarin, I have it available here on ThePirateBay as well as on Demonoid (main release) and on MiniNova. You can find the links at http://www.halofubar.com (along with some other schtuff)."

,LooseMorals,2012-06-18T14:25Z,"What Halofubar fails to mention in his haste to promote his own torents. Is that Cantonese is the major chinese dialect spoken through out the rest of the world, while Manderin is the official language of China. You are more likely to find Cantonese spoken in your local chinatown than Manderin, thus more useful to you. Of course if you plan on doing business in China, or which to travel extensively in China, then Manderin would be the correct choice. But my advice, learn Cantonese first, as you can put it to use more readily, then learn Manderin, which will be easier once you've learn Cantonese."
