stuff like ""yadda yadda file does not match file in .cab"" It let me ignore it but one of those files was the map files... so I dont know how stable it will be. 

Has anyone else thats downloaded this gotten these?"

,Stupified,2006-03-19T02:44Z,"The game does work and is very playable, but after the first few levels all the skins and textures go whack. All the walls and stuff turn different colours and weird symbols are everywhere. 

Ruins the game :("
