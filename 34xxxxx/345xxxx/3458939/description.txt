Mark Isham's highly emotional score for the film CRASH will move you in ways you never expected. Beautiful cinematic passages collide with ethnic voices evoking the powerful imagery of the film. The album is complimented by the original song "In the Deep" by Bird York and "Maybe Tomorrow" by Stereophonics.
