Barwise and Etchemendy (2000):

"Language, Proof and Logic" is a complete text and software package providing a self-contained introduction to the basic concepts of logic: language, truth, argument, consequence, proof, and counterexample. The text assumes no prior study of logic and is appropriate for introductory and second courses in logic.

The software included is Tarski's World (for creating and visualizing counterexamples), Fitch (for creating deductive proofs) and Boole (for making truth tables).
