,BeOSDano0,2007-06-21T02:28Z,"If anybody needs a reseed of any of my torrents, leave a message. I archive almost everything."
,BeOSDano0,2007-06-21T02:29Z,"Would anybody be interested in a copy of the following movies:
""Night Slaves"" 
""Crowhaven Farm"""
,alaskajack,2007-06-22T06:05Z,"BeOSDano0:

First, thanks a million for the re-seed. Got the whole thing just fine, though I haven't watched it yet. I'm definitely looking forward to it.

Second, I screwed up on the re-seeding. I changed the directory, deleted it from the Azureus (for mac) window, and now I can't figure out how to add it back. I'd gladly re-seed this for others; I just can't figure out how. Any guidance would be appreciated.

,Drakkenfyre,2007-07-24T11:14Z,"Hello, BeOSDano0! I know this is an imposition, but would it be possible for you to reseed this?"
,Drakkenfyre,2007-07-25T02:36Z,"Thank you to whomever is seeding, now. :)

However, that's only two-thirds of the file. Does anyone have the last third?

I do promise I will seed for a few months if I get this."
,BeOSDano0,2007-07-25T03:23Z,"I'll seed it some more starting Tuesday July 24, 07. Leave a message if you need more time."
,Drakkenfyre,2007-07-25T04:54Z,"Thank you, thank you, thank you! :D"
,Drakkenfyre,2007-08-15T05:06Z,"You still rock, BTW. :)"
,Drakkenfyre,2007-08-21T08:35Z,Woo-hoo! Got it! Will see it pretty much until I've got gray hair.
,aleks018,2007-11-29T00:24Z,"Hi, any chance of re-seeding it again, please...haven't seen it, well since 1970!"
,videoking1,2009-08-14T17:49Z,"Could you please upload Night Slaves??  I've been searching for it for ages,  thanks."
,vgircys,2009-10-09T15:29Z,I'm stuck at 96%. I'd really appreciate a reseed. Thanks
,junkmail20031,2009-12-03T15:48Z,a reseed would be like a gift from God. seriously. My brother is begging for me to find this for him for Christmas!
,ticktock01,2010-11-14T15:58Z,Please reseed. TIA
,Lonepup,2011-08-13T08:12Z,"August 2011 - of all the years I've been on TPB, I have never requested a torrent to be re-seeded.

So I'll give this a try - My only way to say ""thank You"" is (very rare movies like this) I myself re-seed 1,000%. In fact I'd check on this torrent a few times a year to make sure people aren't out there hanging at 74%.

Ok got the whole movie! One thing was strange, while downloading this at like 500 bits/hour, after it was finally seeded less than 24 hours ago, the remaining down loaders were all from Australia.

Don't worry mates, from land down under, I will continue to seed for my friends there. 

I watched this movie, for the first time since I was small kid....early '70's... there are no disappointments - Lloyd Bridges was an incredibly great actor.

I watched this movie last night, and there was this scene where he almost got ran over by a car. I jumped up - it startled me that much.

The only thing I remember about this movie when I was a kid, was that there was a ""twist"" at the end. 

It startled me as well, and now I remember why this movie stayed with me all these years, although I could not remember why.

I should also thank TPB, because without them, I could not have viewed a great movie.

Again, for my mates from the land down under, no longer need to fret - I will continue to seed and monitor this great TV movie from time to time and make sure nobody is stuck.

,indyaries,2012-01-16T01:59Z,"I've downloaded this film.  First, thanks to the uploader.  I've been wanting this film for quite some time.

My rating:
A-8
V-5
M-9

I don't understand why the file size is so large for such poor quality.  Also, it looks like there are at least 4 subtitle selections, but I cannot get them to function in VLC.

I'm seeding this for a while.  Thanks again!"
