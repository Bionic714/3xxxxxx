,zoeck,2006-03-14T10:09Z,"sorry, the balance (left channel much louder than right, if u listen to the music with a dolby 5.1 system) is not fixed at all!!! does somebody know a program to fix that?? thx"
,Stoney68,2006-03-15T21:02Z,There is no soundproblem when you listen in stereo. And by the way: thereÂ´s really no point in listen in dolby 5.1 when the record is plain stereo!
,zoeck,2006-03-16T22:03Z,"about 90 GB of mp3s sound really good through my system and i never had any problems with the balance !!! but before we start a discussion about 5.1 or stereo, we are just listening to mp3s :D "
