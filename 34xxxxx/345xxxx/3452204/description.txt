TV Carnage - A rich tradition of magic

Crazy fun stupid hypnotic TV mix mashup party tape.

From their page:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
To begin, put the tape in the Video Tape machine and press the button that says 'Play'. If you are not totally naked by the end of the tape, perhaps you should discuss your early childhood with your analyst. This is the second of the TV Carnage Series. It will make the most jaded, angst-ridden sod in any scene bust a nut. They will go from brood out loud to laugh out loud, as they watch KISS explain their lives on "Kids Are People Too". Or, watching a Don Johnson mannequin blast through a brick wall that is adorned in a Mean Joe Green poster. You read that right!
This seamless compilation of the most cringe inducing television is an intergalactic journey into some of the worse ideas ever created. It will serve as a guide for what not to do in daily life for the overwhelming number of citizens and celebrities who take their cues from TV, on what to do in life.

Try not to feel like you have your shit together after checking out some of these moments:

Don Johnson and Mean Joe Green talking seatbelts.

Gary Coleman talking safety with the occasional sexual innuendo tossed in.

A Three?s Company alternate opening that will keep you awake for a week.

KISS on a 1970?s Paul Lynn Halloween special.

Numerous examples of horrible, horrible acting.

A "Grunge" figure skater. 


And other glorious cheap, tawdry and embarrassing behavior culled from hundreds of hours of television

See a clip!
