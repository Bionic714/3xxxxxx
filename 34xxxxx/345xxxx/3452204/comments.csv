,fromer,2009-12-28T18:14Z,"hi bulldozerman

if you really are a fan of the tv carnage, maybe you could take down the torrent. Tv carnage sells the dvd's online so that more of them can be produced from the revenue. if they are given away for free, this cuts his losses. I hope you can understand. 
thanks,
a fan"

I got hooked on TV Carnage by downloading it, and now i have bought them all. WOW!

AMAZING!
