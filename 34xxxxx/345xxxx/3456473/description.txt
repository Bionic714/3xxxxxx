Somehow, someway, the group managed to release an even better disc than the last
--even though they were up against adversity. Former lead singer Matt Kramer wasn't around for this one,
 and because his distinctive voice was such a big part of the Saigon Kick sound the results of this one had
 been questioned before release. However, Bieler--who had sung lots of background on the first two discs-
-smashes through fabulously with the lead vocal duties. Also, the guitar sound once again sounds even better
 than before. The songs themselves seem a bit more simplistic, but the energy is still there. The band explores
 a few new directions as well, but their overall sound and style remains the same.
Highlights include "One Step Closer", "Torture", "Fields of Rape" (great power ballad),
 "I Love You" (and another one), "My Heart", "Sentimental Girl", and "Close to You".
 Also included is a great, soaring cover of David Bowie's "Space Oddity".
