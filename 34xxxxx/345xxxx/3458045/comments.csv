,alcocops,2006-03-16T19:13Z,"No, wait. The last track has some sound faults in the 20 seconds between 4.50 & 5.10. Downloaded it twice to be sure. Is your original file damaged, obmen? Any chance of a replacement?"
,obmen,2006-03-16T20:14Z,"well, f**k! I hadnt noticed. I just got this one a few days ago and that has never happened before. Ill try ripping it again."
,ClaudeCat,2008-04-18T06:53Z,"this is one of the 2 best R&L Thompson releases... but IWTSTBLT is far better. as for solo RT, I like Mock Tudor and The Old Kit Bag, though Front Parlour Ballads is also great."
,sjbnj,2008-04-22T02:49Z,"Great pick obmen, and nicely remastered.  Although I feel they peaked with SOTLs, who's gonna split hairs over pure genius."
,chasezlegoose,2009-04-04T04:38Z,def my favorite album by them. Actually the only one i really like all the way through.
,skinumb,2009-06-09T11:47Z,"HELP! I love and have got all RLT nad RT solo. Trouble is my vinyl of SUNNYVISTA is now knackered. Does anyone have a lossless they can upload? If so I'll seed it for a good long time in return. Cheers in hope, Rich"
