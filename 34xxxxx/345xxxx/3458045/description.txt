Their third stunning album together, which was heavily influenced by their conversion to Sufism, a devotional, mystical sect of Islam. The record is notably much less dark and cynical than more typical R.T. releases (with the possible exception of streets of paradise), and very deep spiritual and emotional themes resonate throughout. On par with their first album, "I want to see the bright lights tonight", which I uploaded a few day ago and is one of the best written and concieved records ive ever heard, not to mention one of the defining gems of the folk - rock genre.
