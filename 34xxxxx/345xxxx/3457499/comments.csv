å - aa
ä - ae
ö -oe
... which is more of a standard. Thanks anyway!"

(My player is iTunes.)"
,maksus,2006-03-16T09:40Z,"I should add that the Swedish characters are shown perfectly for me (wouldn't seed with them bugging, of course).
Which player do you use, if you can't even play the files?"

Johansson goes Bartok - woo!
