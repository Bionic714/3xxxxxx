is smaller because it is compressed with zip
once unzipped xp will be 569 megabytes!"
,LatHack,2006-03-14T18:01Z,Is this XP with no service pack's integrated ?
,LatHack,2006-03-14T20:18Z,"I'm currently looking for a clean (no sp integrated) XP to run a local server with low cpu usage on, i have the latest 2006 XP release already...
It's hard to find a unintegrated XP these dayz :-("
,anonymous999,2006-03-14T22:49Z,"this is sp2 integrated with all the hotfixes to feb 14 2006 integrated as well.

I have that clean copy your looking for with no service pack just keep your eyes on recent torrents."

,thomas_hb,2006-03-15T13:11Z,Does this include Activation Cracks/Workarounds?
,anonymous999,2006-03-16T01:26Z,"if you use a valid key xp pro corp
does not need activation
and yes the keytools are in this torrent
the generated keys allow you to install but will fail genuine advantage (windows update)
get the genuine advantage tools 
somewhere on this site."
,yon-yonson,2006-03-17T08:00Z,"Could somebody supply a link to a torrent for the genuine advantage tools?

Much obliged..."
,Forgetful,2006-03-30T20:59Z,"Would not format the drive,
why can't they just post a real xp pro torrent
the other torrent I have did not work either."
,lleb,2006-04-08T02:12Z,"tried this and after starting and finishing the blue screen section of the install (not the BSOD) i get ""error"" can not boot operating system.  in other words, this torrent is cr4p and does not work.  dont waist your time with it."
