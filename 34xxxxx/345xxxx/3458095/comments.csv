,jaybird007,2006-03-17T04:04Z,"See comments over here: http://thepiratebay.org/details.php?id=3451038

Apparently the game doesn't work well with non-english Windows."
,Churchills Dog,2006-03-17T11:16Z,"If you like this game buy it. They just made big news by verbally bitch slapping Starforce in public and speaking against copy protection. Also, these guys are small independants publishing it themselves. they deserve your support."
,blizzardveers,2006-03-17T13:59Z,"I have to agree. This is an amazing game, especially for a company that doesn't have millions upon millions of dollars behind it. 

Buy this. I went out and bought it after playing it, the extra content in this game actually makes it worthwhile. If you like it? Support this company."
,avatar1969,2006-03-17T14:16Z,Thnx M8 it works perfectly. This is a GOOD game very good actualy!!!thnx
,Piddyx,2006-03-18T02:56Z,"Nice AI.  Most realistic one that I have seen,"
,Breadbox,2006-03-19T22:21Z,Dudes.. i have no idea how to make this install... i just downloaded until my copy arrives from the store ( sold out for at least 2 weeks)... am i just being a dumb newb or should there be.. like an *.exe file to install it..?
,lapis2,2006-03-21T13:49Z,yeah your a dumd noob
,tuderen,2006-04-11T17:33Z,"Says the guy that can't spell dumb. :P

This is an image file of the game cd's/dvd. Basicly, you mount the image with Daemon Tools or a program like that and you'll have a virtual cd to install from. xD"
,Anton_norton,2006-05-18T09:35Z,I read about this company and decided that i will go out and buy this game instead. You do the same!
,kid_ics,2006-07-22T09:27Z,Can someone reseed this? I have been downloading for 50+ hours at a 1/kbs.
,Hedonist83,2006-08-02T19:59Z,*suck* not really a fun game
,Celethorn,2006-08-16T09:10Z,Does anyone have some working serials to this so that I can use the 1.2 patch
,jjb1992,2006-09-01T15:44Z,"This game is great... BUY IT! This company deserves for everyone and anyone to buy it. This game rocks, plain and simple. We seriously do need to help out companies like this"
,Luckmann,2006-09-07T20:01Z,Damn you jjb. Damn you for being so damn right. =|
,Soondead,2006-09-24T19:48Z,"Nice game, but it's really just civilization 4 in space. With crashes. Lots and lots of them."
,newbreed1,2006-10-07T17:14Z,Can someone tell me why every time I try and save a ship design this damn thing crashes :S
,Velkator,2006-12-06T18:42Z,"Why does game go black when I try to start it? Anyone have a fix for this?

I have a english version Windows.

I would love to buy the game, if it's as good as you guys say. But that's why I want to try it first =/"
,Homsar22,2006-12-08T19:47Z,"I think the guys who made this game KNOW about things like BitTorrent and deliberately put their game out with no copy protection, KNOWING that it would end up somewhere like here. I think they are relying on people who love this game to be honest and download it and play it but THEN buy it. So if you DL and like it, PLEASE buy a copy and support them."
,joshin,2007-01-03T18:06Z,"Ordered via Amazon but is going to take 14 days to deliver.  I'm too impatient to wait.  :)

Thanks for helping me not wait patiently!!!

,noidkid,2007-03-15T23:08Z,"downloading... but if it's as good as you all are saying it is, I'll definitely buy it.

...and nothing wrong with it being Civ4 in space. One of my favorite games is Alpha Centauri, which was basically Civ2 in space."
,DaBookshah,2007-04-06T08:49Z,"I agree with the above comments. This is an awsome game, and I read their statement that starfoce was shit, so you should support them and buy it if you like it!"

,d_gamma1,2007-08-28T12:35Z,"hi, im new to this how do you start the installation thx"
,gubbins,2007-10-03T08:20Z,"I enjoyed this so much I bought it. 
I wouldn't have bothered if I couldn't have tried it out first. 
So there you go! Let's hope the rest of the industry cottons on to this fact ..
Oh and the fact I can download it infinate times forever using my serial # is a MAJOR selling point.

Thanks blizzardveers! "

,Jonofwrath,2009-05-02T19:20Z,Can't remember if I patched this or something but when I try to load it up it asks for email and serial.
