"The characters from "Private's Progress" return from the war to continue with their peace-time work. Naive Stanley Windrush causes an industrial relations disaster when his workmates decide he is too eager in his job. However, the labour union reluctantly decide they have to back him...

An hilarious pastiche of 50s class struggles, with a brilliant performance by Peter Sellers as the union shop-steward, this film will have you laughing if you have liked any of the Ealing comedies, are a Peter Sellers fan, or just think that maybe the means of production should be controlled by the state after all."
