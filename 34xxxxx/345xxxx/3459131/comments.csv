,exhuman1,2007-07-07T19:14Z,"Please, can anyone who has this seed it?  There are about 8 leechers stuck at 97.3%.  Thank you Thank you!"
,smileyeagle,2007-12-11T20:37Z,"Any chance of a seed?  Been seeking this a while, but no point in clicking download unless there is a seed ..."
,phill088,2008-07-16T19:40Z,"I'm in the same boat as the others, will someone please seed so that we all can complete."
,phill088,2008-07-16T19:44Z,"Has anyone actually got the rest of this file, past 97%?"
,tinotopia,2009-05-05T14:38Z,"I've been at 97.3% for about a month now; I do not think that a seed is going to come along with the remaining 104 MB.

This is a good argument against ever uploading RARs or other archives; if this were -- for example -- just an MP4 it would be possible to watch pretty much the whole movie by just skipping through a few scenes where there's missing data.   As soon as the thing is RAR'd, though, every minute of the movie becomes dependent on every other minute, unless there's some better unRARing utility that I'm unaware of that can deal with incomplete files."
,SirPhin,2009-08-13T22:47Z,97.4% for 6 weeks. Could anybody please reseed.
