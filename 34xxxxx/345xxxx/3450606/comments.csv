,made-of-technetium,2006-02-28T01:05Z,This looks to me like the torrent contains both the disc image & a multi-part rar of the disc image. assuming this I am just downloading the disc image.
,sidewalk_when_she_walks,2006-02-28T01:11Z,"Oh man I just checked that, I accidently Extracted the Image from the winrar archive when I was installing the game. "
,sidewalk_when_she_walks,2006-02-28T01:15Z,note: I accidently put both the .rar archive and the extracted image in the file. Set your client to not download the rar archive or to not download the mds and mdf file. sorry about that.
,Nehoma,2006-02-28T01:27Z,"shitty game... 

 all uploaded copies of this game work fine, you just need to use securom on some"
,sidewalk_when_she_walks,2006-02-28T01:32Z,"I agree about the working copies, But most people just dont get the instructions so I put it together step by step. About the game, overall Its a good game in my opinion. 
But yeah"
,Killbill21,2006-02-28T12:38Z,"I like this game, it was good enough that I ""choke,choke"" bought it.  Still I loved trying the full game out first.  Thanks Piratebay ;)"
,Notnorian,2006-02-28T18:10Z,"You pirated that game and then bought it?

,sidewalk_when_she_walks,2006-02-28T19:24Z,"Its all in the instructions, that I included in this file. "

,sidewalk_when_she_walks,2006-03-02T21:52Z,"Okay, You said you downloaded this game. Did you download the copy off of my or elsewhere?
For the install did you set daemonon tools to emulation securom? then mount the big image and install?
then you turned off daemon tools opened it up again used emulation securom and then mounted the mini image? then used curerom ?
make sure your curom profile is right. If you follow the steps I listed in this torrent you cant go wrong."
,sidewalk_when_she_walks,2006-03-02T21:53Z,"Make sure you use the sweaw curerom profile included, "
,sidewalk_when_she_walks,2006-03-02T22:08Z,"Okay and here is the reloaded crack. 
Check this out this may solve your problems.

,Luno,2006-07-05T20:56Z,"I cant get the sweaw to work, when I do as instruction no.13 says the text is red and next is unabled, plz help"
,MickDagger,2006-07-08T22:21Z,"Luno, if it's red then you need to correct the path to the game.  You probably installed to a different drive than c:\ for example."
,MickDagger,2006-07-08T22:22Z,"I followed the instructions and for a while there, it really looked like it was going to work just fine.  But then when I finally tried to run the game, it says ""Emulator detected!  Please deactivate virtual drive and emulation software.""

So, where did I go wrong?  And how do I fix it?"
,MickDagger,2006-07-08T22:46Z,"On a whim I tried S7.Stop to fix it, but that just gives me a different/new error of ""a required security module can not be activated.""

Little help here?"
,MickDagger,2006-07-09T16:43Z,"I never did get it to work.  Using a crack from another torrent site, the game did finally launch (i.e., no more security workarounds) but it just crashed once in DirectX."
,accu-chek,2006-07-16T18:35Z,Instructions: How much console power do you need to have this game working? (( would be nice if someone would post it here. . .
,Potentia,2006-07-25T12:53Z,"I've done everything according to the guide, but when I mount the mini image and start the game, it takes a long time loading and then this appers
""Unable to authenticate original disc within time limit.
Try again?""

What do i do?"
,master_chief,2006-07-25T13:08Z,"Finally I got it working! The last time I downloaded this game, like three months ago, it worked the first time I started it. But not the second time. Now it works all the time. I downloaded another torrent instead of this due to no seeds but I downloaded the instructions from this one written by a Pirate King called sidewalk_when_she_walks, followed them and it worked. So just do what he says and it will work. If it dont work, then you havent done what he said."
,Potentia,2006-07-25T14:48Z,"I'll uninstall it and try again, if it doesn't work then would you mind sharing the other torrent you used?"

,jibjab,2006-09-28T00:40Z,If you get the time out keep trying - in the end it worked for me. I think it times out because it is difficult to read the image somehow - seems to be quite slow and takes up a lot of cpu
,jibjab,2006-09-29T00:15Z,"And if you upgrade to 1.05 it won't work, unless you update - I found one on http://www.gameburnworld.com although I think the only difference is CureRom 2.03 instead of 1.3.
Worked for me! (still had to try more than once tho)"
