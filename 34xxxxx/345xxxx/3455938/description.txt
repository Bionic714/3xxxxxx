Six Feet Under - Season 2 DVDRip
Video : Xvid 1.1.0 512x384 ~720kbps@25fps
Audio : LAME mp3 CBR 128kbs

Actually, this is a reencoded version of the MEDIEVAL release you can find on edk. That release is quite bad (poor video quality -probably encoded with a very old and buggy xvid codec-, HUGE AC3 audio stream), but it's the only one I could find with acceptable quality.

Here it is, reencoded to fit nicely on a single DVD. The video quality is similar to the original, that is, barely acceptable for a DVDRip, but who cares :). Audio is ok.

Enjoy !
