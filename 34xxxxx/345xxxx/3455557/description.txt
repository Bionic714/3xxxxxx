Compiled to promote the yearly Warped Tour, this compilation offers 50 bands that will be appearing at the 2002 edition of the festival. Offering everything from classic skacore (the Mighty Mighty Bosstones) to poppy indie rock (Ozma), this album does an excellent job of displaying the variety of artists in the lineup. What makes it work well is that the songs chosen are mostly short and concise examples of the artist's work, so the listener literally gets a small taste of just about everything. Plus, there are some really great bands on here, including classic hardcore heroes Murphy's Law, snot-nosed rockers the Swingin' Utters, Celtic punk revivalists Flogging Molly, exuberant emo specialists Autopilot Off, and many others. With a tight track selection and a good grouping of bands, Warped Tour: 2002 Compilation is a great way to gauge how interested the listener would be in the tour.
