ESham doing what he does best, Spittin' Some Ol' Wicket Shit.
Judgement Day, Vol.1 is the first cd in a compilation of two cd's. Many people don't know this, but ESham was the first person in rap history to release a "set of volumes", some think it was Master P in 1995, but it turns out the revolutionizing ESham had topped him 3 years earlier. Anyways back to the download, all the tracks are in good quality except for the 8th track has a couple cuts in it, scratched CD or something. Enjoy Juggalos n ESham fans.
