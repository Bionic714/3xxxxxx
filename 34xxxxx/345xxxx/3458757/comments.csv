Homosexuality is a mental disorder."
,Terry Thomas,2006-03-17T20:22Z,"Thanks, Masseur, great movie."
,Uglytroll,2006-03-21T08:24Z,I'd say chronic ignorance is the bigger disorder

,sippan,2007-07-15T01:29Z,Heterosexuality is a destructive behaviour which contributes to the overpopulation of the planet and thereby the destruction of our species. =)
,cidade,2007-09-06T18:20Z,oh really... and i guess a planet full a fags would guarantee the success of our species?
,CrazyCreep,2007-11-03T10:42Z,"Hey, guess why there are both. If it was only hetros the planet would be overpopulated and if it was only gays we would die. Think about that for a while. "
,TheIceLynx,2008-01-27T05:46Z,"So like...do people just search for controversial movies so they can say mean things?  If so, that's sorta messed up."
,WafflesSupreme,2008-06-03T01:35Z,"Um yeah, anyone who says homosexuality is a selfish republican ass. Gays are just the same as us, only they like something different than us. Would you discriminate against someone who likes vanilla when you like chocolate? No, you wouldn't, so quit with your nonsensical bull shit and quit being a bunch of effin bigots."
,WafflesSupreme,2008-06-03T01:36Z,"Sorry about the mistake in my last comment, it was supposed to say ""Anyone who says homosexuality is wrong is a selfish republican ass"""
