  Han-gi, a thug in a brothel, falls for a college girl Sun-hwa whom he came
  across in the street. As she totally ignores him, Han-gi kisses her in a
  fit of anger. What he gets from her is only an insult. Soon, Sun-hwa falls
  a victim to Han-gi's plot and she becomes a prostitute in his area to repay
  the money she owes. Han-gi ruins her life to his level and he keeps watching
  her in a secret place hidden at the other side of a mirror in her room.

  She gets used to the life as a prostitute. She finds out it was Han-gi who
  ruined her life but she also knows it is too late to get out of the
  situation. While she gradually falls into the desperate ordinary life,
  Han-gi is torn apart between an obsession for her and a sense of guilt. In
  the middle of love, hatred, compassion and despair, they become one and
   face their destinies...
