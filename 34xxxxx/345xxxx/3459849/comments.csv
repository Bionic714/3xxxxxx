,Rexxxifon,2006-03-20T02:38Z,"Poptart, seriously? hahaha, 1 day later.  Nice Job."
,toddw,2006-03-20T02:45Z,"Thanks mate__you rock!!!

T.W. ;)"
,toddw,2006-03-20T02:48Z,"@ Rexxxifon__ yeah, Pop's got my Raptor release beat by a few days LoL .

Great release anyway!!  T.W."
,PopArt,2006-03-20T03:02Z,"Rexxxifon, it was an easy one. PMDG didn't learn form their previous release ;-)"
,Rexxxifon,2006-03-20T03:04Z,"I had a feeling it would be the same method of Crappy Protection.  But I wasn't going to go get it from them, to find out."
,toddw,2006-03-20T03:20Z,"Just grabbed all available Liveries for the 747-400F CARGO from PMDG, get them while you can___ looks like they're re-doing their download server___ Go Grab'em!!!__


T.W. ;)"
,Alec246,2006-03-20T03:33Z,Thanks a billion man! YouÂ´re the best
,dreamer63,2006-03-20T03:50Z,"You're a day late ;)
Thx dude !!"
,PopArt,2006-03-20T04:04Z,"No, PMDG was a day too early ;-)"
,gareth2,2006-03-20T04:18Z,next a400m wilco fleet
,Werwolf6,2006-03-20T04:19Z,"Dont work :(

Hit ""ok"" no validation and exe closed.. "
,Rexxxifon,2006-03-20T04:38Z,"Can verify, it closes for me as well, HOWEVER.  If you load the Crack, at the Validation entry screen, then NEXT Box enables right away, but I'm pretty sure, it will not validate, you'll be able to install, but I don't believe it will work, if Memory Serves with the Base 747 Package.

Someone please post a solution."
,Werwolf6,2006-03-20T04:40Z,"Yes,  then NEXT Box after crack is enables..
close the crack, hit ok and installer closed.."
,Werwolf6,2006-03-20T04:41Z,"PS
I have the the Base 747 Package"
,Werwolf6,2006-03-20T04:46Z,"also but with the ""next"" activated, it is not installed.
 clic over ""next"" and the exe remains blocked..."
,B744,2006-03-20T04:47Z,the gauges are black anyway :) 
,PopArt,2006-03-20T05:10Z,"I have installed it without any problems, just follow the instal notes in the package. Run the exe, fill in some BS, run the crack, hit the crack's dialog button (needed!), hit next on the installer and close the crack. That's all ;-)"
,Werwolf6,2006-03-20T05:16Z,"Fact from instructions, exactly,  but  null to make... :(

Sin..."
,zorgon34,2006-03-20T05:19Z,roger that i click OK and it closes you can run crack without hitting OK and then install but it won't work
,PopArt,2006-03-20T05:33Z,"Hmmm, it seems like the same problem some had with the previous release. I see what I can do. Patience, it will come ;-)"
,B744,2006-03-20T05:38Z,nope the base pack wont be a problem as that is requiered.
,Maximus-,2006-03-20T05:55Z,"Thanks PopArt :)

Yeah, looks like we have a problem here. But, if someoner can find the registry entry for the new 747-400F. maybe we can solve this problem.. like another crack for the 747-400.  If someone know a friend who maybe have this new PMDG. try to take a look inside his aircraft.cfg file, anf look after those lines:
[AFDSAuth]
---BEGIN SHA1---

---END SHA1---

Copy that longe code/key and we have to make a new .reg file to install manually to the correct registry entry. It's worked for PMDG 747-400. And i can see this new aircraft.cfg have the same key/code as the old aircraft.cfg from PMDG 747-400... Just an idea :)"
,Maximus-,2006-03-20T07:30Z,"Yeeeesssssssssss.. Good news.. I have made a reg key for the new PMDG 747-400F.. i'm flying now.. all gagues work :) PMDG gonna hate me now.. hehe

Need some more test before i release the .reg file"
,PopArt,2006-03-20T07:43Z,"I was thinking the same Maximus! I tried the other reg entry, but didn't work. Can you PM yours (serial and reg entry?) Thanks!"
,luke97,2006-03-20T07:48Z,Tnx mate!!
,Rexxxifon,2006-03-20T07:58Z,"Maximus is correct, my aircraft.cfg showed an empty encrypted entry as well, However, pasting the entry from the base model, didn't work with the freighter.  I'm thinking they used a different Registry entry.

Maximus, I hope you've got it."
,Maximus-,2006-03-20T08:04Z,"Good News! It's works :D 

PopArt.. i send you a PM.. and I send you the files to your mail.."
,Rexxxifon,2006-03-20T08:21Z,"Great job Maximus, I'm pretty sure Popart went to bed though =( Any chance of hosting the files in another torrent, and post the link here?"
,blindchicken,2006-03-20T08:57Z,"ATTN: File ""Validation Bypasser"" contains Trojan ""TR/Dldr.Anskya.A.1""!"
,Rexxxifon,2006-03-20T09:43Z,"Maximus has her working, you can grab his Reg files from http://thepiratebay.org/details.php?id=3459930

Enjoy! Yes, it does work."

,ivod,2006-03-20T23:39Z,"Thanks guys! I just downloaded a couple of torrents conserning the 744F and finally got it to work(so far). 

I love the pirate bay. The funny thing is I found it by accedent. I was searching for 'PMDG 747 crack' and the first site was the pirate bay. Too bad I had spent $80 the previous week on the LevelD 767 and FsPassengers. :( If only I had known about this site earlier..."
,AMDnoob,2006-03-21T05:56Z,Thx so much popart and Maximus i love the 74F's and this just made my day.
,Rexxxifon,2006-03-21T10:46Z,"Don't feel bad about paying for the LevelD 767 and FSPassengers, they are both great products I've paid for myself.  I don't ALWAYS download freebee's.  If it's well worth it, I don't mind paying sometimes."
,mad_flyer,2006-03-21T16:57Z,TPB Rulz!! Thanks PopArt and Maximus for the crack!! Great work!
,whupp,2006-03-21T21:04Z,"Hi everyone, i'm getting a 747 gauge error when i try to load the plane, then fs9 freezes, i followed all reg entries ok, anyone else get this? ah well i'll keep on at it."
,whupp,2006-03-22T00:41Z,Got it to load ok after a re-install but now the primary flight displays fade out / go dark after about 1min.
,pilot013,2006-03-22T08:39Z,"Bravo..it`s great,now downloading!"
,pilot013,2006-03-22T10:00Z,"Yes,it worked....Super...As i got to know,now the normal passanger version will be with un updated panel too,with the digital altimeter!"
,whupp,2006-03-22T20:50Z,"woohoo, all is running well now, dunno why it didnt work before, just re-installed again..."
,pilot013,2006-03-23T09:46Z,"Yes,it`s really fantastic....

But How to open the cargo nose,doors?!??!And so on?"
,PHBFO,2006-03-24T07:38Z,"Can you also upload the new update?
With better VC frames :-)"
,Bob_T,2006-03-24T10:41Z,"Thanks PopArt. :)

PHBFO, you beat me to it. I was getting ready to ask the exact same question. Hopefully we'll get the update soon."
