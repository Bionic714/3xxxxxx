I anyhow promise to do my part of it, keeping the seed open a while after getting the last part. If not I discovered its OK, the whole movie works, opening the incomplete (99,5%) iso-file in VLC media player "
,mandala,2006-10-17T16:02Z,Wrong with the VLC-player. Thing to do is to extract the DVD-files from the 99.5 % iso-file with winrar (rightcklick open with > browse for winwrar. Voila. Extact and enjoy.
