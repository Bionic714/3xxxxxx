,lobohtomy,2006-03-09T15:56Z,"vanmaniac: i tried rar a few times, i personally hate "".avi"" files myself, but when i tried to upload the rar files i got the same error all the time. I just wanted ppl to have this release as fast as possible since noone cared to upload it, i'll look into it some more next time =P."

,SoundWall,2006-04-13T20:39Z,"vanmaniac, what, are you f*cking retarded for real?

RAR = No seeders!

Why? Because people have to unpack the download in order to use/watch it, and no-one wants a duplicate of every file they download. And they don't want to unpack something every time they'll use it either!


Anyways, nice upload! :)"
