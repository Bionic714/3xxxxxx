,Orchestra,2006-03-16T16:41Z,Sorry about that. Renamed a file for aesthetics and forgot I was seeding it :/. Should work now.
,urbanriot,2006-03-16T21:25Z,Woohooo thanks!
,deje162,2006-03-17T12:50Z,"Btw, Lucifer is by Mike Carey not Neil Gaiman (who is equally good if not superior as a writer). And Lucifer is an ongoing series so it couldnt be complete...

but thanks for a great seed =)"
,paparman,2006-03-21T09:58Z,A big thumbs up for your torrent :)

,npanxx,2007-04-29T02:18Z,"Please re-seed, I'm stuck at 71%. :(

Many thanks!"
,opredeleno,2007-05-30T21:00Z,"Wow! Such a precious having. I'm seeding this for several days already and feel so happy that other people want it too. When I have the chance, definitely will buy at least the first book.
Cheers from Bulgaria!"
,j00k,2007-09-22T15:04Z,"Lucifer is not complete, although most of it is there. Its not ongoing anymore though, its finished at issue 79.
Also there is less than half of books of magic there. 
Dunno about the rest.
Good torrent though."
,CandiedHaggis,2008-02-26T05:02Z,"Orchestra, thank you for the great upload.  I've been meaning to read Sandman for a long while now, and this seems to be the only seeded Sandman torrent on TPB.  Respectfully, I have one gripe, though:  This is a collection of rars and loose jpegs.  You should really post comix torrents in .cbr or .cbz format - makes it a lot easier on the rest of us.  
To make a .cbr, simply archive the jpegs (in order) to a .zip file and rename the .zip file extension to .cbr (or .cbz), this enables a sequential image viewer like CDisplay to view it page by page like an actual comic (or graphic novel) rather than having to open up every jpeg page scan one by one by one by one...
Thanks again!"
,jydl102,2008-03-30T04:24Z,"thanks so much,i hope this torrent is still available!"
,DokLazlo,2008-05-07T14:53Z,Can anyone tell me how to convert my bunch of jpegs (for a comic book) into one of those nice little cbr files. Visited the CD Display site to see if there was an additional application to buy but my email bounce back via daemon failure. I have some Alan Moorse Swamp Thing I am trying to organize so this advice would be most helpful. Thanks!
,Rubeus_Hagrid,2008-06-27T23:38Z,"DokLazlo, you save the jpgs of pages in sequential order, numbered 00.jpg, 01.jpg, 02.jpg, 03.jpg, etc. (You should name the cover 00.jpg so it displays in correct order.)

Put all of the images into a folder, and then .zip the folder. Rename the .zip to .cbr, and you're done.

I'd love to read those Alan Moore Swamp Things when you're done. I bought them all when I was a kid, and would love to read them again."
,Rubeus_Hagrid,2008-06-27T23:39Z,"Love this collection. One problem with it, tho: Sandman #34 is missing p. 8.

Anyone have a copy of that page they can put up?"
