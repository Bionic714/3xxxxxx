,Chrilloo,2007-03-09T23:46Z,"Damn lamers, this is clean. "
,DenialTwist,2008-04-06T19:23Z,songs skip terribly.
,Shrewo,2008-04-10T12:36Z,"I haven't listened to all the songs yet but..
In my experience, no ""terribly skipping songs"" as DenialTwist said there was.

And no virus-warnings, so yeah it's probably just a good record ;) and free xD"
,Moll3r,2008-07-04T11:34Z,"This is an great map.. No virus, and the songs sounds exactly like on the cd..

So i just wanna say thx for this great torrent :P"
,freeuser12,2008-07-07T02:45Z,"1.This is not a retail rip, the bit rate doesn?t change like an official retail rip

2.My favorite song ?sing for the moment? skips (1=15 & 4=40 skips) I tried downloading from Limewire, rapidshare but all of them skip, its like the internet share the same f* up song, if someone got the retail song please upload it or give me a link to download it"
,ppilihp,2008-08-21T08:18Z,thanks
,meowmix4jo,2008-11-09T02:13Z,"freeuser12: you obviously know nothing about music files.

where it was ripped from has NOTHING to do with the bitrate. this is CBR, what you are talking about is VBR.

i could take this and make it 320kbps VBR, that doesn't mean it was taken from the actual CD."
,Fransiej,2009-02-26T13:10Z,"good torrent and high download speed! thanks:)

songs are good!

i scanned with nod32 and no virus was found!

,P3ntium,2009-03-23T18:12Z,Thanks mate 
,freeuser12,2009-03-25T09:12Z,"meowmix4jo: i think there was something lost in translation?.
Im aware that songs can be changed to any kbps (quality) whatever you like, how ever you like (format) since I use Acoustica Audio Converter to rip music of cds or to convert .ogg / .wav / .wma  format to .mp3 and so on,
my point is that the same song (that skips) -sing for the moment- is being shared all over the internet"
,weej2008,2009-07-07T00:09Z,some people are saying it works some arent whos right so i no wether to download it or not :)
,Ropower,2009-12-06T01:48Z,"Thanks for this, my copy of this CD"
,Ropower,2009-12-06T01:49Z,"oops, sorry about that.

*My copy of this CD is all scratched up and I only have it ripped in 128, so, big thanks!"
,i_am_sid,2010-05-03T02:40Z,thanks marin63 for this but i want the clean version of this album. Can you upload that or just tell me where i could find it.
