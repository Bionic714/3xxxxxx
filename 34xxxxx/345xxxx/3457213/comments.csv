,mofoq,2006-03-14T18:01Z,"damn it....there was a packet faker amongst the ranks....'cause the .rar and the .r00 file were corrupted and my torrent client didn't catch it the first time around.

anyways, re-downloaded fine."
,st.isaac,2006-03-14T18:29Z,"Was the other LOL release just bogus, or am I missing the correct codecs to play it?  All I get is a 3 minute grey avi encoded with Indeo 3.2...  WTF???"
,mofoq,2006-03-14T19:08Z,"st.issac, if the filename has ""7PM-8PM"" and it was one big rar file of smaller rar files, that one was fake....thespit-whatever pulled a fast one on many of us....hope he got perma-banned."
,st.isaac,2006-03-14T19:48Z,Yeah it was.  Thanks.  That's really annoying.
