,Bema7,2006-03-07T00:51Z,"From wikipedia:

CSI's theme song is ""Who Are You"", written by Pete Townshend of The Who as the title track of their 1978 album. The show's spinoffs also use Who songs as their theme songs, ""Won't Get Fooled Again"" for CSI: Miami and ""Baba O'Riley"" for CSI: NY, both recorded by The Who in 1971 for their album Who's Next."
