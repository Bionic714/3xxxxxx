Solid Steel Show 28/6/1997

I was at a friends house drunk on gin and we found this on the radio, KissFM London. It was recorded to tape and transfered it to MD and then to my PC some years later. I think the DJ is Strictly Kev.

The sound has been tweaked and polished to sound better. I think you'll like it.

At the end there is a mix of Butterfly by Talvin Singh.
