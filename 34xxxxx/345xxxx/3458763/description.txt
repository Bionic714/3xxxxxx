Release Notes:

This release contains a GOLD crack meaning it works on all v4.9.x builds of Movie Collector Pro.
This GOLD crack should work on many future versions as well.  When a new version of Movie Collector
Pro is released, just install the new version and run this patcher again.


Movie Collector is a program that helps you catalog your collection of DVDs, VHS tapes, laserdiscs,
etc... This organizer software runs on Windows 95, 98, NT4, ME, XP and 2000. 


Catalog your movie collection
Adding items to the movie database is quick and easy, just type the movie title or scan the DVD
barcode with your barcode scanner. 
Movie Collector will automatically download all data (director, producer, genre, studio, etc...
including an actor list and the cover images). The information is retrieved from various movie
database sites on the internet (like the Internet Movie Database, the Amazon DVD catalog or DVD
Empire). 

View and search the movie database
Once you have added a number of DVDs to the inventory, you can view it on the main screen. It is
possible to show a simple list of all movies, but you can also organize your collection by genre,
director or actor, etc.. using the automatic folder feature. 
All lists can be sorted instantly, just by clicking the column headers or by using the Sort Order
screen. You can sort on any field, e.g. alphabetically on title or label, or sorted on release date
or purchase date. 
Use the Quick Search feature to find all movies that contain the word you type, or use the Advanced
Filter command to search in specific fields, even multiple fields at once. 

Print lists
Lists of your movies can be printed in any way you want. The Print feature lets you choose which
movies to print, which fields to show and in what order to list them. Printed lists are ideal for
insurance purposes, or to take with you to the store. The Pro edition of this program also includes
a number of templates for other nicely formatted print-outs. The flexible XML/XSL-based template
system lets you create your own layouts too (requires XSL programming skills). Visit our Templates
page to download templates created by other users. 

Export your movie catalog (Pro edition only)
Using the Export to HTML feature you can generate HTML pages of your movie inventory, for use on
your homepage or website. You can create one index page listing all movies (with one row per
movie), optionally linked to detail pages with one page per DVD. 
If you want to be able to use your movie data in other programs, use the Export to XML or Export to
Text functions. A special export feature is included to export your database for use in the ListPro
software on your PDA (PocketPC or Palm). 

Integrated Loan Manager (Pro edition only)
The built-in Loan Management system allows you to keep track of DVDs you loan to friends, family,
etc... Just log which DVD you loaned and to whom and you will always know where your missing DVDs
are. 


Use Movie Collector to:

? Catalog DVDs without typing
All data is downloaded to your movie database automatically

? Instantly sort your lists
On any field, e.g. alphabetically by title, director or genre, or by year

? View DVD cover thumbnails
Download cover images or use the built-in TWAIN scanner support

? Search your movie database
E.g. find a movie by title or all movies that Arnie plays in

? Print movie lists
Ideal for insurance purposes. Print any field selection and in any order

? Export data to HTML lists
Place your movie database on a website, including cover images

? Track your loans
Track who borrowed your DVDs, loan dates and due dates


Whats New In v4.9 Build 3?:

Fixed:
- Access Violation when program closes on Windows 98
- Color field of movie was not retrieved from Collectorz.com infosources.
- Tapespeed appeared in details view when not set for non-english versions.
