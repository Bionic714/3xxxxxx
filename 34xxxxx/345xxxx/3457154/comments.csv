,Zoara,2006-03-14T23:51Z,"Jordi, you bring a smile to an otherwise miserable day. It is a very selfless thing of you to do - you gain nothing at all. You are helping others laugh. (Many of us are students/cannot afford to pay for podcasts - ricky could have kept this free by allowing Channel 4 to sponsor him).   
We all think of you when we download. (the demand is there - just look at the number of times it's downloaded)"

,lemmy-snickers,2006-03-15T03:51Z,"Great work mate...

Only prob... Is it possible to make the audio better?
Compared to the other ones from season 2, this isn't as good.
No offence... I do appreciate it :)

Keep up the good work :)"
