,XTerroRX,2007-05-19T23:34Z,Seed. Please want this game badly... :)
,DJDrumish,2007-07-07T18:35Z,"dude.

thank you.

you have no idea."
,Garockk,2008-02-02T10:00Z,"Thanks so much, i always wanted to play this game but i forgot about it until i found this today by chance."
,Onionbear,2008-02-28T23:07Z,I don't get it. It shows up as a RAR file and my comp won't open it. What do I do? Am I missing an application?
,MrPoopers,2008-04-16T15:21Z,"A rar file is a compressed archive; that is, it is a file that can contain a collection of other files, compressing them through the use of very complex algorithms.  In short, it's like a zip file, but it isn't yet widely supported. Here's the url of a program that supports rar files, and is available for multiple platforms (as a trial): http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm"
,MrPoopers,2008-04-16T15:33Z,"Ah, I found one for free:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/rarexpander/"
,NESfan,2008-04-18T04:31Z,"Also u can download 7Zip , that also works with rar"
,zarreph,2008-11-11T21:47Z,Does this rom not freeze after you win the battle against Johnny? It seems every time I try to get a SMRPG rom it does that.
,MrPoopers,2009-05-04T08:23Z,You are welcome!
,MrPoopers,2009-05-13T04:36Z,"Also, Secret Of Evermore has great gameplay and graphics, but the storyline really lets you down at the end of the game."
,MrPoopers,2009-06-02T19:12Z,"Thank you guys so much for seeding this!
This game's added exposure (that you have provided) will (hopefully; I just wish I could see how many times it has been downloaded, like they used to do at PirateBay) guarantee that it will be remembered for many years to come, and will not fade away like so many other games (like Dark Half, Metal Marines, etc.).
The only reason I chose the RAR format is because it has support for recovery records.  Peazip has support for the RAR and ARC formats, which both support recovery records."
,Mdawg20,2010-07-17T10:22Z,"Awesome game! Thank you so much! I had the original snes game but it disappeared some time ago.  The game worked great. Only problem I saw was: when fighting Yardovich about 3/4 the way through the fight no text showed up. Everything still worked, the boxes would show up but with nothing in them. After the fight, I saved the game and reset. I didn\'t have any problems whatsoever throughout the rest of the game.  O I did notice 1 box in the nimbus land castle was shown as hidden in the guide, but the box was visible."
,JimmyJazz332,2010-09-19T01:39Z,Which WinRar do you recommend using? From the list you provided from rarlab.com.
,JimmyJazz332,2010-09-19T01:54Z,"Wait, using the SNES emulator, it says to load the game and I can't select it in both the extracted and non-extracted folders. What do I do to run the game?!"
