Okay when you open the folder up, just select all of the files besides the NFO file. Extract. Then after there should be a folder rld-sofb. Now use DAEMON tools to mount the .cue file. Now to get the keys, open the NFO with notepad; keys are in here. And to open the cd, just go to computer and explore the mounted disc.

,Deezcrack,2012-05-30T00:44Z,"Amazing pack when you're out of stuff to do, or bored with playing with your ""Pets"". This EP has the chance to go WILD if you add Seasons and Nightlife. I don't recommend on getting this EP if you got Apartment Life or FreeTime, though, you'll either have a hard time managing your Sims' life or the worst case scenario, DIE trying, just sayin!!! Anywho, for those who are in doubt of the functionality of this torrent, you're being ignorant.
I really am glad that these guys live to give all of us (the cheapmunks) this masterpiece! YAY to RELOADED! :)"
,Deezcrack,2012-05-30T00:53Z,"Oh, btw, to get pass of the Update, there's NO way to get past it otherwise the installation will terminate itself. So, here's what I do.
I got PowerISO and Daemon both running. Mount this torrent's iso (after you downloaded it and unrar'd it OBVIOUSLY) with PowerISO, then Mount your Sims 2 base game's disc 4. That way, the installation will run without it asking you to ""insert"" the 4th disc.
And what's there to ask about it ""NOT WORKING"" if you DON'T have the base game?! Geez, that's the whole point of EXPANSION, it's solely made to EXPAND the BASE."
,Deezcrack,2012-05-30T00:58Z,"By ""Mount your base game 4th disc"" I mean Mount it with Daemon. So you'll have two ISO reading softwares running. If you got my procedures right, you'll have NO problem."
