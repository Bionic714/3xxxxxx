,slindfors3,2006-03-13T13:59Z,I would download it if it weren't infected by the serious malware called Starforce ;) In fact I'll have to import the full version from US just to get rid of it since the version in US doesn't have Starforce for some reason.
,tlarseth,2006-03-14T02:10Z,"Um...This is the US version, and all versions they released has starforce included in it.  And this version of Starforce didn't mess up my computer at all, no lagging, and my anti-spyware/anti-malware programs didn't detect any info leaking from my computer while running the game."
,slindfors3,2006-03-14T02:50Z,I was talking about the full version ;) The US version will use Tages instead of Starforce. All according to the gamemakers :)
,tlarseth,2006-03-15T00:24Z,"have you ever seen Tages?  it tends to act up more and wreck more havok on your computer than starforce, as it ties up quite a bit of CPU resources."
,tlarseth,2006-03-15T00:26Z,"oh, BTW can someone post what their upload speed is, so I can check my settings on the computers I am using to seed this."
,tlarseth,2006-03-17T08:26Z,"Nevermind, a buddy of mine told me he was downloading at around 115Kbps"
,tlarseth,2006-08-24T12:06Z,"I stopped seeding this, as the game is out now, and I was not too impressed with it, I have a 512 MB NVidia Geforce 7 series card, and the game graphics was glichy as hell, so I am not bothering with this file anymore."
