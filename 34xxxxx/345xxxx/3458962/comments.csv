,Arklite,2006-03-18T10:16Z,"Hehe. Love how those sites take credit for the discovery of the round globe as opposed to flat (courtesy of Magellan), the lunar landing (courtesy USA) and basically everything in between."
,SQRK,2006-03-18T10:19Z,Stupid cunts!!
,w000ter,2006-03-18T11:49Z,"like bible nuts that think it predicts the future, or bible code freaks.

u can't be serious.  the koran contains enough damningly horrible stuff that anything else in a supposedly perfect book is basically and fundamentally invalidated:P"
,w000ter,2006-03-18T11:52Z,"the koran leads the way to bigotry, religious hate, justification for violence, mixing church state and military power, oppression of women, complete lack of freedom of thought, and oppression of all infidels."
,GaNjaMaaN,2006-03-18T15:51Z,Yee Right!!
,GaNjaMaaN,2006-03-18T15:52Z,"The only thing the koran leads to is Stupid
People."
,Sargent_D,2006-03-18T17:41Z,How laughable. The only thing the Koran leads to is the dark ages.
,duckncover,2006-03-18T18:43Z,"The Koran is no better than any other religious document.  Anything that teaches more than basic morality has no place in todays world.

I will however download and watch this simply because I find religious fanatics hilarious and I am sure this will have me shaking my head and questioning whether man would have been better off drawing pictures on caves and never learning to read these things.

As for evidence in the koran, you must be joking?  What evidence do you speak of that someone couldn't write now?"
,Hihi38,2006-03-18T18:50Z,"Have u all read Quran? NO ! Do u all know what ISLAM really is ? NO ! U all haven't give a piece of youre time to read the Quran. Then why u all talking like you know what the Quran is. If you all not know about islam ""DON""T TALK BUT LISTEN"" and make a research what ISLAM(=PEACE) means

PEACE"
,tomtomx,2006-03-18T19:14Z,"Hihi38: How nice it would be if some arabs and mullahs read it aswell... 
Today the only deeds that are done in islams name are terror, murder, mutilation and opression... What is a religion? The texts or the way it is performed?"
,tomtomx,2006-03-18T19:54Z,By the way. Islam doesn't mean peace. Far from it. The word islam means submission.
,tomtomx,2006-03-18T21:30Z,"Well dred05. After reading lots of your earlier comments, it sure as hell didn't work for you..."
,nea2006,2006-03-18T21:52Z,"Most of people confuse between some extremists and islam !

You do not have to forget that it is the arrogance and the injustice that create and feeds the extremisme !

Please, see this movie in stead of to say anything !"
,toronto_bengali,2006-03-19T03:32Z,KORAN = Satanic Verses of the Cult of Death
,CharlesMartell,2006-03-19T09:44Z,"spare us the koran has given the world zero science but plenty of pain and suffering, it has destroyed many actual civilizations and replaced it with backwardness and barbarity.

william shatner has done more for science the the unholy koran and its cult creator mohammed."

,_-klempo-_,2006-03-19T11:56Z,Don't you ALL have something better to do?!?!?! GEEEZ!
,GaNjaMaaN,2006-03-19T21:14Z,"""the great religion Islam""  Who are you fucking
kidding?? 

Without that fucking religion 90% of the wars and allot of all the problems in the world would
not exist!!"
,tomtomx,2006-03-20T00:54Z,"It's kind of strange that everywhere in the world where muslims have neighbours of a different faith, they are at war. At the moment muslims fight religious wars against jews, christians, hindus and buddhists. And where they don't have any nonmuslim neighbours they fight against themselves. Sunni vs shia etc. How come!!!?
(And yet some people call islam a peaceloving religion. I just don't get it.)"
,Darndare,2006-03-20T18:35Z,So the Quran is like the Nostradamus verses? A lot of baloney that should be intepreted as wisdom? 
,deviantish,2006-03-21T01:29Z,"THe problem is not with Islam against christianity... its maybe muslim vs christian ... islam doesnot promote terrorism, people do.Just like christianity doesnot say to bomb people, governments do that.And if islam is a problem then like all problems we should get to understand wut it is and then decide a solution to it(if it indeed is a problem) but simply shuting our eyes n opeining our mouths , saying its bad is of no help to anyone."
