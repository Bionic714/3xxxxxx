These are maps for Star Wars: Empire at War available on the SW:EaW bonus disk.
IMO the rest of the Bonus Disk is garbage (some bonus art, a couple of underwhelming
screensavers, and wallpaper that is basically in-game screenshots), but the maps 
are useful. There are 2 new land maps and 3 new space maps.  Map names are:

Land:
Polus Winds
Ryloth Garrison

Space:
Peril Above Polus
Race for Ryloth
Shipyards of Kual

Install notes:

Just extract these maps with file structure intact to the 
"C:Program FilesLucasArtsStar Wars Empire at WarGameDataData" 
directory - or where ever SW:EaW is installed.

(Note: If unzipping is successful, A new folder named "Art" should be created 
in the "Data" folder after extraction.  Beneath that, two more folders, 
"Maps" and "Textures" should contain five files each.)

Start SW:EaW and set up a multiplayer game.  The five new maps will now be 
available!

Shouts out to RELOADED who were good enough to release a blessed NO-CD crack for 
this game.  Now my CDs can live where they belong - in their box on the shelf!

Also, please don't post these files or this torrent on private trackers.  BitTorrent 
was designed to make file transfers free and easy.  Leechers suck, but privitization 
is not the answer - it just creates a different set of problems.  Public trackers 
only, please.
