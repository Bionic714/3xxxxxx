Monarch Pro is a Windows-based business intelligence and reporting tool designed for easy use by everyone, not just a select group of "power users" with advanced technology skills. Unlike other BI or reporting tools, Monarch Pro easily "mines" data from existing text-based or PDF reports - an information source often overlooked by other BI tools. Monarch Pro also enables users to access and analyze data from database files, spreadsheets, ODBC sources, delimited text, and HTML files.

Monarch Pro's unique modeling technology allows even non-technical users to effortlessly build a collection of filters, calculations, summaries and charts and apply them to different data sets, plus export data at anytime to Excel, Access, PDF, and more ? all without programming and without help from the IT department.
