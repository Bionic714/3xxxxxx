This is the recorded books unabridged version of
James Joyce Ulysses
Narrated by Donal Donnelly & Miriam Healey-Louie

If you have seen this torrent before .... its not THIS one.
I created this one on 26/11/2005.
I have the original discs and am ripping them at 128kbps...

Saw that there was a torrent out already, but all the reviews said it was corrupt... decided to buy the original and sort my own..

Why the first 10..?

because it takes a while to rip them..

A cautionary word...

If you leech but dont seed I wont be uploading the rest of the discs...
dont know about you but i is fukkkked off with people downloading and then fukkin off without sharing..
point in case... just uploaded a torrent... 2 days later 180 downloads... zero seeds 5 leeches...

isnt the whole point of this that we share.... if you cant be arsed to share then dont fuckin download...

(sorry bout the rave.. but it gets right on yer tits..)

thanx.
