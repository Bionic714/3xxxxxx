,mac_user777,2008-09-24T10:21Z,Hi I would more than like to share but I have a problem here in NZ with our connection we pay a shit load for a minimum cap of 10 gigs per month which is reallly pathetic by international standards so please excuse me if i download this without seeding it because i want to share but can't afford it.Correct me if I'm wrong and seeding takes alot less than i'd imagine.As soon as another cable is installed to my tiny country I;m gonna lshare this book hard.
