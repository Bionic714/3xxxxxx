,ergot,2007-06-09T18:30Z,Just go to archive.org and download them individually; it's still free and you'll get a much higher download speed.  ;)
[V],cezen,2010-02-18T16:39Z,"I second the archive.org suggestion.  YOu can start DL here, and then go to archive.org and Dl, move it into the folders created and then reload into utorrent, it will show ""checking"" and then you will be a complete seed.  it is what I am doing.  This genre is TOO funnY!"
