,HeavensWrath,2007-10-26T02:31Z,"Is anyone else having problems with two songs on this torrent?

On Bushfire Fairytales, track 10 (Mudfootball) and 13 (It's All Understood) do not work for me.  Were they encoded differently than the rest?  I'm on a new computer, so I may be missing a codec, any help (could someone check what it was encoded with if it works for you)?  All the others work fine."
,thedrunkpirate,2007-11-23T17:17Z,It's all WMA... =(

,johnnybigoode,2008-03-13T13:04Z,who the fuck uses WMA?
,lolleur1,2008-11-10T00:00Z,"WMA is quite alright, its straight off disk, no conversion, just burn as mp3 and stop whining or else use Media Converter: SA edition, and encode to MP3 without any loss (i know it, i use it) use the software and just stop whining about WMA, kk?

Bye, Peace out, Great torrent, no problems with any songs, Jack Johnson = Wonderfull singer"
,0n1c3,2012-07-24T17:21Z,"Thanks for the upload!

@stupid comments: Stop complaining you morons it's free so who cares what format it is in? Too stupid to use a converter? "
