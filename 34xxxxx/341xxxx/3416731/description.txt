Komatsu Ayaka was the actress of Sailor Venus in the live action series, "Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon." The following is Ayaka?s 3rd Idol DVD.

This DVD may very well be Ayaka's most provocative work to date as most modeling footage shown are from her photoshoot sessions for her photobook, "Summer Date.? This DVD will provide some good insight as to what goes on during the photoshoots and after. Provocative and erotic as it all may be, you'll find out that it's really just entertainment. 

Besides Ayaka modeling, you'll get the chance to know a bit more about her, as she answers some personal questions throughout and takes part in some fun activities.

The highlight of this DVD is seeing how well Ayaka can play Ping-Pong. She's won trophies and is one of the best players from Iwate Prefecture.

The film makers had the Omake a part of the Main segment.
