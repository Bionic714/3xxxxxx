,Fisiltut,2006-01-26T14:47Z,"Hi!
I`ve downloaded the keygen, and patched the file in the pluginfolder, but when I try to generate the licensefile I just get a error and the keygen shuts down.. Can anybody help me?"
,psr75,2006-02-20T18:24Z,"6) Open up Maya and load up the plugin - window>settingspreferences>plugin-manager>renderman_for_maya.mll - Check loaded. 

7) Close Maya and re-open it just to test if it's working - you should be able to access the plugin from Display Render Settings. 

8) congratulations "
,psr75,2006-02-20T18:24Z,"4) Go to pixar licence server 3.0 and also copy the file into there
If you don't have the pixar license server 3.0 download(pixar_license_3.0.msi) and install it.  

5) Start the server from start>run>services.msc - Highlight ""Pixar License Server"" from the list and choose Start."
,psr75,2006-02-20T18:25Z,"Install

1) Use your computer name as server 

2) Use your Mac address (you'l find it Maya>licence utilities>Ethernet address) or by ipconfig /all from CMD in windows) 
generate a licence file - license.dat - and patch C:Program FilesPixarRenderManForMaya7.0-1.0plug-ins 

3) Copy the licence file - license.dat - to the C:Program FilesPixarRenderManForMaya7.0-1.0etc"
,funkybuddha,2006-02-21T18:01Z,"The previous instructions look easy enough to follow, but the proble is when I run the keygen and try to generate the dat file it just says there's an error with keygen.exe and just shuts down.  Can't complete the rest of the procedure without a dat file.  anyone else have this problem or know of a solution?  Any help would be greatly appreciated."
,sockdart,2006-03-15T03:38Z,"This site has a walkthrough of how to do it, and there's also the license 3.0 file on there somewhere.
But it's in Russian, so babelfish it.
