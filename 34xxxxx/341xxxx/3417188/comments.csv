Thank you!"
,ameboaboy,2007-01-05T17:32Z,This is some amazing stuff.  Can anybody offer some advice in finding more ChrisGoes torrents?  A basic search of ChrisGoes just comes up with people piggybacking on this name.

thankyou"

,Rockandre,2009-03-27T04:26Z,"Absolutely brilliant work, Chris!Thank you for making these available to us.I like contemporary stoner rock/doom bands a lot, but there are still so many exciting original heavy psychedelic bands from the 70's to re-discover...Iron Claw, Electric Sandwich..."
