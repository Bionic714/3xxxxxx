The Vagrants - The Great Lost Album (Leslie West) (1965 - 1968)

Most famous for featuring Leslie West on guitar in his pre-Mountain days, 
the Vagrants were extremely popular in their home base of Long Island, NY in the mid-'60s, and recorded some decent singles without approaching a national breakout. Like fellow New Yorkers the Rascals, the Vagrants prominently featured a Hammond organ, and often played soul-influenced rock. The Vagrants were far more
guitar-based than the Rascals, however, as well as projecting a more garagey, less mature outlook; their later material lands somewhere between the Rascals and Vanilla Fudge.

One of the few rock bands signed to the folkie Vanguard label, the Vagrants cut some fair singles between 1965 and 1968 that suffered from a lack of identity: a Zombie-ish number here, a punk stomper there, a soul-rock thing here. "I Can't Make a Friend," which shows up on some garage compilations, is the most well-known of their initial efforts, but the group took their closest swipe at stardom after Felix Pappalardi helped them sign to Atco.
 
A rock version of Otis Redding's "Respect" (which surfaced on the Nuggets compilation) was a hit in some Eastern regions, but couldn't compete with Aretha Franklin's rendition, also released in 1967. After a couple of other singles on Atco, the group broke up in late 1968, when West formed Mountain (which also included Pappalardi). Much of the Vagrants' material 
was reissued in the mid-'90s.

Truth And Janey - Erupts (Superb Hardrockers Live Performance 1976)

The Truth and Janey sound is probably captured best on this live record. It's a mix of classic rock, psychedelic guitar rock reminiscent of Hendrix, and the progressive structures of a band like Budgie. Lots of jammy parts, some of them heavier than others of course. Some of it reminds me of the same kind of deep blues rooted 'Cream' material. Nice and heavy, but soulful and tastefully done.

This Truth and Janey CD shows that some things never change ? even in almost 30 years. This masterful live recording from April 8, 1976 at the Col. Ballroom in Davenport, Iowa showcases why bands today should be paying homage to Truth and Janey. They were laying down the heavy, slugging it out on the circuit, rolling off riff after riff, tasteful extended solo after solo? doing things their way, while thumbing their noses to the era of disco. 

Sonically, this is the best kind of band sponsored live release. It sounds like a bootleg from an audience member, but a bootleg done off the soundboard after slipping the soundman a twenty. It?s clear, but it?s raw. Instruments are all at discernable levels, and vocals are spot on, but there?s a rough quality here that allows the listener to be taken back 28 years and dropped dead center in front of Bill Janey lighting up his stratocaster. I mean, if you like ?live? recordings that make you feel as if you were at the show, this one?s for you.

And it?s funny how things don?t change much. This is the first live recording I?ve ever heard where the turnout was piss poor. I?m talking maybe 20 people at the show?!?!?! Not too different from many of the fuzz rock shows I?ve been to over the last few years. But this just added to the whole mystique of the recording. I found myself entertaining the question, who are these cats? How have I never heard this band before? When I think of 70?s underground rock, man, this band and live recording embody the 70?s. They are the real deal.

Musically, they take all the influences of the day (Hendrix, Cream, Captain Beyond, etc.) and manage to create their own sound and unique songs. Bill Janey is a guitarist extraordinaire. Steve Bock?s bass playing would turn lesser players? fingers into pretzel knots. Dennis Bunce keeps time like a Rolex without the pretentiousness. Furthermore, I catch Marc Bolan/T. Rex warble in Janey?s vocals which is a plus in my book. 

All in all, an excellent live recording that engages the listener as close to the live experience as possible. If you like the obscure, enjoy digging into the past, checking out a band that paved the way for good rock bands like Fu Manchu and Nebula, you will enjoy this.

Twentieth Century Zoo - Thunder On A Clear Day (US Fuzzy Bluesrock 1968)

Hailing from the same gila monster-infested Arizona desert wilderness that produced an unlikely harvest of fertile bands (Alice Cooper's Spiders, Kennélmus, Phil & The Frantics) the Twentieth Century Zoo were the paradigm of what was happening to music as 1966 blossomed into 1967-68. These Phoenix shroom-heads stirred the savage fuzzback-laced sounds of the garage generation into the brain-baking trippiness of the emerging SF ballroom scene and made a concoction all their own. Includes the entire scarce Vault-label album, obscenely rare early single sides, unissued cuts and more!

2. Clean Old Man
