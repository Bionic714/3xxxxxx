This is my second video, taped after the 1.8 patch. There's been put a lot more work in both editing and recording. 

There's lots more shifting and harder fights in it then in the first one, also it's a bit faster paced and shorter since I prefer quality over quantity. 

I'm not sure if there's going to be a third one, I put a lot of work in this one and I'm a bit tired of instanced pvp, if there's going to be a next one it won't appear in the near feature. 

As for now, enjoy the ride :) (btw no comment on the last song please :p). 

P.S. Most of the fights were taped before I hit GM, the mace only gives +1% crit and +30 stam compared to fist of omokk
