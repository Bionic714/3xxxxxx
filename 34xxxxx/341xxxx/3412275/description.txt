Noise Ninja 2.1.2 Photoshop Plug-In with keygen

           Noise Ninja is the most effective and productive
           solution for removing noise and grain from digital
           photographs and scanned film images. It is a must-have
           tool for anyone shooting in low-light or fast-action
           situations - including news, sports, wedding, and event
           coverage - where high ISO photography is required and
           the resulting noise compromises the image.

           Noise Ninja often yields a two-stop improvement in
           effective image quality, while preserving important
           image detail. In addition, it can produce cleaner,
           smoother enlargements from low-ISO images.
