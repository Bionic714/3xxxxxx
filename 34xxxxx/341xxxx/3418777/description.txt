Created by:XEIDOG69

Instructions

1)Unrar
2)Run the trainer
3)Click the Launch button 
4)Ctrl+F1 = Infinite Health         
5)Ctrl+F2 = Infinite Sand Tanks
6)Ctrl+F3 = Infinite Rewind
7)Ctrl+F4 = Infinite Sand Credits

*Notes*

*      If it ask for the EXE file when you click launch, go to game directory where Prince Of Persia The Two Thrones is installed, and select the PrinceOfPersia.Exe and thats all..

*     Once gain! you can adjust the amount of sand credits you can have, simply by clicking on the box to the right side of the trainer and typing a number..
However! for the other three options.. I disabled the adjust function because they r set to the max and should'nt be messed with besides they r max and infinite
so there is no need to adjust anything really..Also I believe 1500 sand credits is the most you r suppose to be able to get in the game so if you want the credits 
to save with your file then I would leave it at 1500..itll let you have as many as 9999999 and up but it didnt save for me when I had that many enabled..


Well this is my final Trainer for Prince Of Persia The Two Thrones.......
I hope you enjoy it, It is much improved over my last release,And I cant see
anyone needing or even wanting more then this to play with..If you cant beat the game with this you are hopeless..LOL Enjoy and happy gaming folks.
