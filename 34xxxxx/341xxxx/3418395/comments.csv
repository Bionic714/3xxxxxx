,Ola435345345,2007-06-06T01:18Z,"A ""complete"" discography Is easily the target for discussion. Downloaded all Mozarts works. Some further reading and I got to know he and his wife burnt many of his works. He wrote works in pseudonym for others and those pieces never had  his name on It for example. In Elvis case there should be all kinds of dirrerent pressings and bootlegs.. dont know his Discography but thats the case for ex. Led Zeppelin. "
