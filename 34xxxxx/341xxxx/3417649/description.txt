One of the best live recordings ever recorded. Jerusalem live in USA 1985. This is a LP rip which means it not perfect, but pretty good (it have a few clicks). It is made with lame --preset extreme in one big mp3 with a home made cue-sheet (i really hate live recordings with pauses). U can use foobar2000 to play the cue + mp3 file.
