Ayaka?s 2nd Idol DVD. Ayaka was the live-action actress of Aino Minako and Sailor Venus for the "Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon" TV series.

In this amusing DVD, the concept was for a Gamer Ayaka to play a video game that features random characters that she modeled and acted as. If her character did well in their setting, Gamer Ayaka got to unlock some bonus footage. The ending to this is a bit twisted.

The omake features behind the scenes footage. The bloopers are quite funny.

This DVD is Ayaka's last Nittelegenic produced Idol DVD. She has successfully completed her contract.

Released by [AK] Arctic Knight Productions.
