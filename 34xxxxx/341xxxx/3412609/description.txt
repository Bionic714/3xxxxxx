     PLOT :

      Intrepid archeologist Jack (starring Jackie Chan) and ambitious
      scientist William (starring Tony Leung Ka-fai) set out on an 
      adventure that would lead them to the greatest discovery in 
      Chinese history. Their journey starts at Desar, India, where
      they stumble upon an ancient sword from the Qin dynasty and a
      magical gemstone that appears to be able to defy the force of
      gravity. The booty not only leads them to the mythical mausoleum,
      but it also connects Jack to his dark past life. 

      Through strange and provocative dreams, Jack sees himself 
      reincarnated as Meng Yi, a general who fell for the First
      Emperor's beautiful consort Ok Soo (starring Kim Hee-seon) some
      2000 years ago. As Meng Yi commands his troops in an increasingly
      desperate war against rebels, he also has to battle his own inner
      desires in choosing between eternity love and loyalty, Returning
      to the present day, the final secret of the First Emperor is about
      to be revealed. The two adventurers successfully enter the Heavenly
      Palace, a fortress loaded with death traps and unspeakable evils,
      as Jack comes face-to-face with his past. Or is it really?
