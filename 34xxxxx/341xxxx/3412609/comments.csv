Language is mostly Chinese.  However subtitles do appear in English (at least on my Winamp software).  There is the occassional sentence in English.  The Indian Princess...Santa didn't deliver :(  ."

You need to install vobsub.

Backup subtitle files.

Then extract the subtitles you want with VobSubStrip.

Place the stripped files with movie file."

,Lurest,2007-03-21T11:48Z,"lol eltex, shanghai noon, nights old??
The really good jackie chan classics are those from snake in the eagles shadow(1978) to drunken master II(1994) between this timeperiod ALL jackie chan movies are awesome! lol..shanghai noon...  his american movies are nothing like the old HONG KONG classics. In the american ones all action choreography is SLOWED down from the normal highpace kung fu action jackie was used to due to comments from slow americans saying ""omg i cant see what he does it goes to fast, they're like, fastforwarding"".. nubs..  watch a mid eighties chan movie with fightscenes choreographed by chackie himself and u'll see what a truly good chan movie is like."

,daxumaming,2008-10-04T15:54Z,"movie's great, quality is perfect
however.. i had to use MPlayer to get the subtitle working, and it's on the 3rd. subs doesn't work on kaffeine, totem, and even vlc - or at least i can't get them to work there.

oh, and it's a bit disappointing that he didn't even bothered excavating the ruins to save this hot immortal chick and his general."
