,snaskel,2012-03-08T16:16Z,"The quality is ok. Watchable.
Thank you."
,Night673,2012-05-30T13:05Z,"A/V quality pretty good for its size, enjoyable even on bigger screens. The movie itself is rather a comedy than some drama, in a macabre sort of way. If you have known a broad enough range of sexually twisted individuals in your life (and don't have a trauma about it) then it's genuine fun. Otherwise it might be strange, or even a bit disturbing. But if you are curious, or feel a need to get into the deviant side of life, then i recommend it for starters too, with one expressed caution: tough it IS surprisingly accurate about many funny realities of it, real life characters tend to be much more hardcore than these. With a more serious approach the movie is indeed provoking, maybe even dangerous for some, because it does take it light - probably made for the more seasoned audience. Its up to the observer to see, maybe even know the wast ranges of many differences."
