,mikeon,2006-05-14T01:43Z,Why would you need a crack for the PS2 game?
,Chilliwack,2007-11-18T22:19Z,crack = mod chip!

,BlizBob,2007-12-24T21:50Z,"Get a mod chip. I have Matrix infinity and it's very good.
It's not free but it costs only about two PS2 games worth (that's the chip and it's installation).
If you get a chip like Matrix you can also use either USB-hard drive or IDE-hard drive (if you have the older model with expansion bay like me).
It's best to get the chip and use hard drive. It prolongs the lifespan of you laser, games load faster, PS2 is more silent and you can do some other neat stuff with it."
,BlizBob,2007-12-24T22:04Z,"Then ofcourse it you wish only to play copies you can get a fliptop and swapmagic.
To my understanding you can use HDD with it too but you must always use a CD to boot it.
Swapmagic in -> copy in -> burned game or program loads."
