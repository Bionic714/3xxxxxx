This is an excellent set of films depicting the teachings of Christ.  Each piece of this series is a high quality (DivX format) film.  This series contains 17 relevant books of the bible, both Old and New Testament which accurately portray our Lord and Savior and his teachings.  

There are 17 parts to this series, some films are two parts and other are single files.

The producers remained true to the writings of the Bible so these films are a real learning tool.

I hope you enjoy the series.

Sorry for no IMDB, nothing was available on the series.
