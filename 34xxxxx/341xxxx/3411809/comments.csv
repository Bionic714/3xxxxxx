,TWOBIOS,2010-05-15T19:50Z,"Pretty watchable series, though some of the acting is a wee bit poor.  ( being quite modest with that comment )  However if you have a nice strong cuppa and bear with it ,  its interesting to have all these scenes acted out on screen.
  Jesus has a rather unexpected American accent,but seems like a nice enough bloke.  
 and most of his deciples have taken a break from working as london taxi drivers to play their roles.   
I would say that this is a vHs like quality , reasonable considering you won't be inviting a girl over to snuggle up next to you watching this one.

   It is a bit gory at times too, I know its all biblical stuff, but i really would not recommend showing this to children.   Or just to be aware that the props department spent a load of money on fake blood and limbs.

Not liking the way jesus screams so easily too. 

 Oh , and the music will drive you insane from time to time...
   I don't remember jesus being able to travel in time in my biblestudies.  and this can leave you shouting """"what !! """"    and wobling your cup of tea violently at the screen.   
  Not a bad little (17.5 gig ) download though .  

Be interested to show an episode of this to my christian friends and see how often they shout """"what !! """" and wobble cups of tea "
,lokust167,2010-10-24T20:20Z,"Jesus saves when :-

1. Priests sodomize children
2. Bible allows enslavement of blacks,native indians,etc.
3. The church prohibits usage of condoms in AIDS ridden Africa
4. Missionaries rob the poor sections of the society to build useless churches in Africa and convert them to christianity.

Jesus loves you all!!!!!!!!

I'm a proud atheist and common sense tells me that i dont have to believe in jesus or any god to not harm anyone."
,looknoands,2010-12-21T08:38Z,"1.abuse is done by every profession, not just priests. Where is your brain. They should be fired. Thats whats wrong. 
2. enslavement has happened to all nations. greek empire enslaved.Roman.Persian. Colour hasn't been an issue.

3. What the church allows is up to the church. Everyone has free will. The church even tells you this.
4. not missionaries? politicians. leaders. crooks.
jesus does love us all. He died for all mankind's sins to be forgiven. When does that make you a villain. Perhaps pride stops us from wanting help. Perhaps you should read the book instead of relying on second hand information from the media. or even an entertaining film, which takes liberties at times - see above. 

666 - the shortcomings of evil.
the first 6 - politics
the second 6 - finance
the third 6 - religion.

you'll never change anything about the nature of the beast (politics,religion and finance) if you try to change them - they end up changing you. See the film Viva Zapata.
