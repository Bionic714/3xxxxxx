John Denver's more sentimental Christmas release, Christmas Like a Lullaby, draws upon his favorite religious tunes. Even when he was happy, Denver's voice rang with a melancholy air, and it's this quality that makes his version of "Away in a Manger" all the more somber. "The First Noel" and "The Little Drummer Boy" also benefit from his folky tinge. But the real unexpected wonder here is when Denver steps out of the spiritual aspect of the season for a heart-wrenching cover of "Blue Christmas." For all those who never thought of John Denver as a romantic type, this ought to erase those doubts. True fans will probably already have all of Denver's holiday releases, but for its spiritual/sentimental theme, Lullaby may be the best.
