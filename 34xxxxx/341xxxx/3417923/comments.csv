,SicKn3sS,2006-01-03T00:17Z,wow it takes 600 megabytes to learn these songs? just download the tabs!
,Cottis,2006-01-07T15:41Z,"Yes. But do guitar tabs teach you how to play the fucking song? And what if you can't read tabs? 
This is why this was created :P "
,gibson36,2006-01-07T18:52Z,This is some hard songs to learn ;)

,PERVERS666,2007-02-26T00:30Z,"Thanx, great torrent |-_-|

,Zurr0,2007-03-31T23:26Z,"I don't get why ppl bitch about torrents that are legit. It's like if you don't want it, then don't fucking download it. I think this will be a nice torrent. We need more guitar vids and how to and instructional!"

Hehe. What's that for a stupid comment? If I want to play, I play, I don't give a fuck if I can read tabs or not. Man.. have some fun"
,ZenMan2112,2007-10-23T10:19Z,"Doesn't teach any of the solos.  Good for beginners.  Don't waste your time if you're an intermediate, but then again, what defines an intermediate guitarist?  Jam with him at the end of the lessons, pretty fun.  Paranoid is wrong."
,Ianp,2008-02-05T10:07Z,"Puny, these are great, any more please?"
,SublimeDragon,2008-11-18T21:15Z,"Paranoid is shown incorrectly, and this is only rythym... no solos... 

shit"
,rachyb,2009-04-26T13:22Z,"hi,have u any more?,my dad loved this,thanks"
,schmitty84,2009-06-18T12:06Z,"metalhead... not everyone knows how to read tabs. I can read tabs but prefer to learn by ear. Also if you are making your own songs you don't have to read tabs. To me tabs are a lot like time signatures, it helps to know them but not necessary to know how to play a song. Chances are if you want to know how to play a song, you've heard it before. I know not everyone can learn by ear, but a lot of people can. Try not to be such a fucking jerk. "
