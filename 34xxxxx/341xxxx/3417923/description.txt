Guitar Lessons

SongXpress Heavy Metal V1 (google it if you want more info)

Step by step instructional video on how to play these four songs:

Crazy Train   	(Ozzy Osbourne)
White Wedding  	(billy Idol)	
Paranoid  	(Black Sabbath)
Rock & Roll	(Led Zeppelin)

plus some other stuff that appeared on the dvd. 

These are just guitar lessons not concert footage or music videos.  

Don't expect to see Ozzy. 

If you are a beginning or intermediate guitarist and want to learn these tunes  then I definitely think you'll enjoy this.
