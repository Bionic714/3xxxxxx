,qwenlander,2006-03-15T08:52Z,"Does anybody know if there is 64-bit-compatible version of Syncrosoft emu dongle by H2O or some other distinguished team? Or is there bound to be? I should imagine there is quite a bit of interest towards it... Since my soundcard supports x64 and Cubase SX 3.X supports x64, a dongle with x64 support would be absolutely smashing.

Cheers!"
,Steviebone,2006-04-12T23:52Z,was wondering why the previous release was 1.2 gig and this is 130 meg... whats the difference? this is a rar and the other is an ISO... but there must be something else... is this an upgrade to that release?
,scyde,2006-05-14T19:13Z,"For me it's crashing during install. Just right after you press 'next' for the last time and it should start, but nothing happens.. The song keeps looping on the background.. Might have something to do with h2o virtual driver, or? Someone who could help?"

I've tried downloading different versions, uninstalling my antivirus software, even reformatting my computer again and uninstalling/reinstalling and unzipping it about 20 times over with no luck. I can't let my album go to waste and I don't have the money to buy. HELP!"

,1zibitE,2007-03-18T16:03Z,"CONFIRMATION: This release works!!!

This release is someway odd in the way it is installed but nonetheless: It works! Now stop flaming/bitching - if it does not work for you, you probably got an error #40 (hint: The error lies 40 cm from the screen).

It works with Vista as well! Confirmed!"

,pirate01,2007-04-19T12:59Z,I have several user accounts on my Windows XP computer. After installing this software the computer freezes when I change betweeen the accounts. Perhaps everything is OK if you are the sole user on a computer. I can't use it though.

,matthewdownloads,2007-09-04T12:49Z,"This works fine, I have had it installed for ages and no problem.

Stop complaining about everything. It takes a lot of effort to write an Emu like that, and it works fine. If you can't be bothered to read the instructions or are trying to install it on windows 2000, your a moron.

Yes, it does work on Vista, I checked and there is no problems."
,brelix,2008-01-07T08:41Z,"This release as well as any other current Syncrosoft secured software will not work on windows xp64 bit or vista 64bit, and the reason is because of the TruEmu syncrosoft driver by h20. When either installing h20's syncrosoft driver or running cledx.exe you will see CLED Error, and this is attributable to that incompatibility. 

Driver level software such as TruEmu, which acts between the OS and the Hardware, is not interchangeable between 32 and 64bit systems as far as I know. My question is does anyone know if this problem occurs on every 64bit system even if a 32bit operating system is running? I have not had the opportunity to try this."
,brelix,2008-01-07T08:57Z,"Okay, so after 3 days of searching i finally found a way to get Cubase SX v3.1.1 work on windows xp64 sp2. The solution was right here on pirate bay and I passed over it so many times.

,BLuNTeD,2008-02-09T17:44Z,"There is no trojan in this software, I have been using this version for quite a while now, If your AV software is saying that there is a virus in this download then it is just an error, a lot of AV apps recognize KeyGens or other things like fixed EXE files as viruses, but they aren't really viruses, and won't cause any harm to your system whatsoever..."

I had the same install problem with the other CUBASE SX3 torrent. After loading the program after the intstall the 'protection device is unable to find the external hardware' message comes up and on terminating the app, as it warns that it will, the system becomes unstable.

I'm running windows media center on a mobile amd 64 bit processor, as many new laptops are equipped with so that may be the source of the problem. I am pretty certain that I'm not running win 64 but media center is very different than standard versions of XP. I'll try the link and see if it works because I've noticed that on both of these releases there's a 50 50 split between people who's install worked and those that didn't.  You may have solved the problem brelix, (I hope)  Thanks for the tip :D"
,piratedmoney,2008-03-14T11:22Z,"Well I tried the fix and the program finally loaded up. But when I started a new project I got the error message 'can't find the uvr22h.dll, for 'master 8', which when I looked for it was clearly where it should have been in the 'other' section of the vsts. Then my system got real shaky, as it does every time cubase fails and it was back to rolling back the system restore, so this apps a no go on windows media with 64 bit cpu. Too bad, I'm sure it's a great release from h20 but not on this machine. :("

,Leenix20,2009-03-24T10:20Z,"I finally found the solution guys :) To Vista and XP 64 or 32 bit.

1) Get this torrent. It is Zipped up all it needs is just to extract, and as small as hell, no more downloading those bullshit 1gb Cubase Torrents.
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4212016/Cubase_Studio_4.1.1_by_Antony_GR_(Portable___Non-Install_version


Then go here and Download the Asio4all Driver.
It wil Reduce Latency on Which All Midi Works.
Meaning if you use Ezdrummer as a trigger for your Electric Drums and have 1 Second delays, this is a MUST. Even if you dont have Edrums YOU MUST INSTALL IT.
http://www.asio4all.com/


Now for Ezdrummer.
Get this Torrent, it Includes Both the Ezdrummer Installation and the Drumkit from Hell which is 100 times better than the standard Ezdrummer Kit.

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4565497/ToontrackEZdrummer1.1.1-Mac-and-PC-with-DKFH-Full_with_Serial



And Finally update Ezdrummer with this Patch, it will add a couple of new features in Ezdrummer and make a noticable sound fix to your drums.
