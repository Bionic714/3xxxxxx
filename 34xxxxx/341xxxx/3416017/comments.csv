[V],robbie1412,2006-01-08T12:02Z,Will it just be one season?
[T],clownmonkey,2006-01-13T19:14Z,"robbie1412: if you're asking if the BBC/HBO will produce a second season of Rome, the good news is yes.  The bad news is that it won't come out until 2007.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome_%28TV_series%29"

,var3gen,2006-09-12T08:56Z,"I don't recomend d/l:ing this as there are some problems with a couple of the files. (102, 106 and 110). Can make your Windows-computer misbehave pretty badly (crash) depending on your installed codecs. Instead, d/l this TPB torrent: 3433661 (Rome_Season_1)"
