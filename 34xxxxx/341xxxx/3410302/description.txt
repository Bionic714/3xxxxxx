Battlestar Galactica (Xbox) 
Space shooter that lets players assume the role of Ensign Adama some 40 years before the events of the original '70s television show. The story is set during a critical time for the human colonists as the war against the Cylons is coming to close. Adama has recently been assigned to the Galactica as a pilot and gamers play through the events that will shape the man who will later be Commander Adama, the captain of the last Battlestar leading a ragtag fleet of humans to their fabled homeworld called Earth. The game, developed by Warthog, is based on the 2003 Sci-Fi channel miniseries.
