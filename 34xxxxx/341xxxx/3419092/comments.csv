,EbnoC,2006-12-01T16:49Z,Some songs end before they should and some songs are missing... But not much... Good stuff...
,WJakobW,2007-01-06T21:21Z,"plz seed :P takes ages
 tip: Vet ej om ni vet det men om man gör så att man inte upload:ar (motsatsen till att ladda ner :P) så går det mycket segare att ladda ner.

Säger detta pga seg seed... :P"
,meetarn,2007-02-01T22:16Z,riktigt bra seed ca 400 kbps tack för denna!!
,darklordofdarkness,2007-02-24T23:08Z,whats the bitrate?
,this4example,2007-03-21T13:13Z,"Could someone seed? I`ve only got 1,4% left! Would be much appreciated :)"
,MackanZoor,2008-04-04T13:56Z,"this is a bad torrent. many of the songs/albums are live with bad quality (maybe they are supposed to be/only exist as live albums i'm not sure), but almost all file names arent numbered so they aren't in the right order in the play list. also the album ""Tales From The Twilight world"" show up twice (blind guardian is spelled ""Blind Guuardian"" in one of them). i wouldnt download this torrent knowing these things, going to get another proper torrent instead.

thx for sharing as always though"
,unionjack_boy,2008-09-24T10:03Z,Seeeda för helvete!  står helt still vid 85 % ! 
,glimps,2008-11-11T18:46Z,"Hmm ok this torrent has a lot of errors in it. Lets list a few:

Blind Guardian - And then there was silence : Cover is wrong

Blind Guardian - Battalions Of Fear: Has many songs from Imagination from the other side and missing 5 songs

Blind guardian - Imaginations From The Other Side: OK

Blind guardian - Night Fall In Middle-Earth: Missing all the in between tracks 

Blind Guardian - Return of the Elven Kings: Bootleg so whatever

Blind guardian - Somewhere Far Beyond: OK

Blind Guardian - Tales From The Twilight world: OK

Blind guardian - The Forgotten Tales: OK

Blind guardian - Tokyo Tales: OK

Blind Guardian - War Of Wrath :  boothleg so whatever

Blind Guuardian - Tales From The Twilight world: Duplicate of Blind Guardian - Tales From The Twilight world

I haven't listen to it yet so I can't say if all the songs are complete. 

Thx for sharing though

,450AHX,2009-04-21T16:59Z,"I'm sorry I seeded this. There are *many* errors in this torrent. Some songs are duplicated, some are in the wrong albums, none of the files are numbered, some albums are missing. Some albums aren't even by Blind Guardian (War of Wrath? Return of the Elven Kings?)."
,Mountainmage,2009-05-24T04:16Z,"Seriously, this is really bad quality. Lots of things mislabeled and basically what everyone else has said. I wish I hadn't seeded it."
,Drakinola,2009-06-03T09:59Z,"No ""Follow The Blind"" album. :(

Unhappy face."
,Lukelo,2009-06-21T16:39Z,Seed Please... I'm getting like 25 kb/s -_-
,weljomancer,2009-11-28T14:17Z,the best band there is :)
