Download and run 'Daemon Tools'. Right click on the logo that comes up on the task bar, choose 'virtual cd/dvd-rom', then 'device 0:[F]' (or whatever number and letter is on yours), then 'mount image'. Then find the 'TheM hosp.iso' and click open. If it doesn't autorun, go to 'my computer' and there should be what looks like a new cd drive. Open that then follow instructions.
Have fun!"

,mikkel89,2010-03-02T14:53Z,"i actually got this game to work fine on windows 7 ultimate 64bit. this is what you do if you get some setup error:
in the CD folder: copy the HOSP folder to where you want the game ""installed"". 
the setup.exe file only copies that folder anyways, so it's basically the exact same thing.
only thing is you need to open the file called HOSPITAL.CFG to match the directory you copied over from the CD or saving wont work.
i.e. c:\games\HOSP (default is c:\hospital)

if you have some other unrelated problem, feel free to leave me alone(like if you don't know how to mount .iso's GOOGLE IT! google is your friend, it loves us all)

,lozza_dearnley,2010-10-09T17:41Z,"Ok I couldn't save, but I opened the Hospital.cfg file and noticed that the save override is C:HOSP. Moved the location, it saves fine! (It does crash every now and then though, save before changing hospitals is my only advice) So, Steps! 

1. Download 
2. Seed!! (Amazing how many people forget this step.) 
3. Open the theme hospital file you have just downloaded. 
4. Get mounting software, I use VirtualCloneDrive, also recommended is DaemonTools, many others are available.
5. Right click the 'TheM Hosp' file in the newly downloaded Theme Hospital file, click 'Mount', pick a disk drive. This, for the newbies, will trick your computer into thinking you are using the disk. This exact step might be different depending on the software you use, but you're not stupid, google it, read the manual, figure it out. Stupid people don't deserve to play fun games anyway. In short, mount the .iso file.
6. Go to 'My Computer'. There should be a disk drive called 'THEHOSP'. (If you can install the game, right click, autoplay, and do so now. I couldn't, hit 'Install' til the cows came home, nothing happened. As far as I'm aware, installing it properly allows you to save) For the rest of you, right click 'THEHOSP', and 'explore'. 
7. Located the file called 'HOSP'. 
8. In a new window, open up 'My Computer' again, and open up the C Drive.
9. Go back to the Theme Hospital pretend-cd, click and drag the 'HOSP' file onto the C Drive. 
10. Yay, Theme Hospital is now on your computer! Opening up the HOSP file, double click the 'WINMAIN' file, the game should start and work fine (at least it did for me.) Phew. Hope that helps those of you are having issues, its taken me about four times longer to write this than it did for me to figure out how to fix it, lol! Good luck."

Installation won't start on Win x64 due to incompatibility. To install the game anyway, just browse in the .iso file by either mounting it to Daemon Tools or similar virtual CD app or by just using winrar and simply extract folder ""HOSP"" to your hard disk. The actual installation only does this, it copies this folder to your hard disk. 

To play the game you should also download CorsixTH-Beta8 and run the game through this tiny, yet very helpful app. 

If you follow the above, the game runs flawlessly on Win x64 (I'm using Win 7 x64 Ultimate)! "
,enveezee,2012-01-03T22:31Z,"There is a free open source theme hospital engine called Corsix-TH available on google code http://code.google.com/p/corsix-th/ that runs on MacOSX, Win32/64 and Linux that will play the game with the data files from the cd."
,enveezee,2012-01-03T22:36Z,"in regard to my last comment, in linux/macosx you can mount -o loop -t iso9660 /path/to/cd.iso /cdrom/ in windows you will need a virtual cd emulator. They plan to make ISOs mountable in Win8 but prior its not a built in feature. Also FYI all you need is the HOSP/ directory from the cd to play corsix-th so someone should probably just torrent that zipped up so dumb people have a chance. heh"
