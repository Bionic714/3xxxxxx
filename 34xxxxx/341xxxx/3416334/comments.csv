,newfie28,2008-09-21T23:21Z,"Hey tomtomx dont be ignorant man,to kill him now would only stand to identify him as a direct threat to their tyranny.The worst thing that could happen is for them to be exposed and if you think 911 and other ""terrorist"" acts are not actions from within your own government(s) then you just are'nt tuned into whats going on or else you are personally involved in this tyranny.Get a life,grow a brain and for fucks sake stand up a be a man and actually do something for this cause instead of being a moron denier.When this shit goes down(and I really hope its doesnt) you'd be the last one to depend on and the first with your fuckin hand out kiss my ass loser,and to everyone who cares for humanity and the world fight on,peace..."
