,CooLVick$,2006-02-19T10:32Z,You're Most Welcome :)
,Bobolink,2006-05-09T23:18Z,Thank you!  Just what I needed.  :)
,Bobolink,2006-05-10T09:48Z,Sorry to report that it's a no go.  Installed the crack & overwrote the .dll files you provided.  Tried 3 times.  Nope!  :( 
,DavidGGG,2007-02-10T21:12Z,"Works fine!
Only two of the 3 crack files were present in the original install (not ArmAccess.dll), but I copied them all in there and it seems to work. Can verify very fast ripping!
I suppose most people will move on to v10 now, but v9 is perfect for us ol' Win98 users.
Will try to seed for a while if more 98/ME users are out there."
