,gerner,2006-01-09T00:01Z,"Yeah, likewise, thanks very much for these.  Surprisingly difficult to get hold of good quality frasier rips.  

I'll help out with seeding these and (hopefully) and future seasons :D"
,zumberman,2006-01-12T00:16Z,Thanks. If you can bare my slow connection you can download season 4 torrent (same quality) from http://thepiratebay.org/details.php?id=3430813

,ramlock,2011-02-25T00:42Z,All of these have a slight video problem. It is not easy to notice at first but about every minute it lightens to a pinkish filter over the whole image then darkens again. It looks similar to the way Paramount dvd's used to sometimes not mix with vcr's connected when playing dvd's. The macrovision copy protection is maybe the problem.
