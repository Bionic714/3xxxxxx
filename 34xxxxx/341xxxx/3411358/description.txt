J.J. Cale (w/Leon Russell) - Live In Session (DVD) 

Notorious for his laid back style, JJ Cale is probably most famous for the songs he penned, including "After Midnight" and "Cocaine", which Eric Clapton made into hits, and "Call Me The Breeze", later covered by Lynyrd Skynyrd. 
However, Cale`s influence wasn`t only in songwriting, but also his unique sense of rhythm and shuffling boogie, which heavily influence performers such as Clapton and Mark Knopfler. 
This DVD is the most intimate look at JJ Cale ever. Recorded in 1979 at the Paradise Studios in Los Angeles, this rare and unique session, with Leon Russell on keyboards, gives fans the chance to see this unique talent at work in the studio.
