,cradle,2008-01-03T02:21Z,are the episodes as bad as season 2 18-25 ??? totally unwatchable !
,Refzem,2008-06-04T12:56Z,"Yes Cradle. these Episodes are almost not worth watching since the qualite is crap!

Haven't found anything better yet though"
,supanovaz,2008-08-23T16:01Z,I've uploaded over 20gig of this now. Not the best quality but there completely watchable.
,12314,2008-12-15T14:09Z,Is there something wrong with this torrent? Every time I try to download it after a few minutes it says its being used by another program and the download stops. I downloaded season 3 without any problems...
,12314,2009-02-16T03:07Z,nvm got it working
,WARFDEE,2010-05-08T21:56Z,Am I the only one out there trying to get my ass in gear and make a proper hd rip of this show.  Wish some others would get on it and post whatever episodes they can to speed up the process but everyone these days seems content to simply bitch about crappy quailty and leave it at that.
