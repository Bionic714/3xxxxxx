Manhunt (Xbox) 


A violent action game from Rockstar, Manhunt is the story of James Earl Cash, a man previously thought dead who wakes up in a town filled with deadly gangs. Guided only by the whispers of a man named "The Director" through his earpiece, Cash must find whatever he can to survive the night. Players must make strategic choices as to which weapons to use, ranging from silent and stealthy to loud and destructive. Everyday items may be the key to your survival, as plastic bags become instruments of strangulation, and shards of glass your defensive weapons. Escape the nightmare that is Carcer City and maybe you'll learn the identity of the mysterious "Director".
