so please people with a 100% keep uploading or this torrent will die and that would almost be a disgrace to humanity"
,frosto,2007-03-12T02:50Z,they r numbered on btjunkie by the way
,MrMessy,2007-06-27T13:04Z,"Does this torrent actually have any seeds? This page says theres there is 1 but utorrent isn't showing any seeds. 

Am stuck at 84%"
[T],bi20,2007-07-29T04:47Z,"I came back to seed it a bit, but please downloaders keep seeding so other can download aswell."
,Hamurabi,2007-08-07T21:03Z,"Is it only me or would this have been more usefully  distributed as 10-40 separate torrents? Although you can download a single file (or a certain subset of the files) from a torrent not all programs support this, almost no users know this and even fewer know how to."
[T],bi20,2007-08-08T15:07Z,"you know how to download seperate files and so will everyone that reads this :P

and it's easier to keep a big torrent alive than multiple small torrents, imho."
,RJWaters2,2007-10-11T03:00Z,Please seed!  It's dead :(
[T],bi20,2007-10-17T17:56Z,"I will seed, but promise you will seed when you have the whole file."
,synthersizerpatel,2007-11-12T08:07Z,please seed! I have 96%
[T],bi20,2008-01-22T11:09Z,"here I come, but seed you afterwards, please"
,Jimpants,2008-04-17T00:43Z,97 percent common ill seed this for a fu(!ing month if someone just helps me finish this amazing torrent!!  Pretty please! Don't be responsibile for this torrents death!
,Jimpants,2008-04-19T08:55Z,"I am on my hands and knees begging someone to seed this torrent, I so desperately DON'T want this torrent to die.  Please if you seed about 1 gig I will upload this torrent 3x over!!!! PLEASE.  The daily show is too good to let die. RALLY PEOPLE!!!!"
[T],bi20,2008-04-24T22:53Z,"yes, but do really seed it until the end of times, ok? :P"
,Jimpants,2008-05-18T16:42Z,"God I love some good bigotry in the morning!
We (americans) are not all as stupid as the above man.
Second My computer crashed before you started to reup so I had start at ZERO! but when i get done i will seed for a long time."
