Eric's Trip were a great, underrated Canadian Band, and the first band from Canada to be signed to Sub-Pop.
 Early 90's, sweet sounding, recorded in the kitchen, noise-pop, guitar rock. A must listen.

"Eric's Trip are one of the few truly unjaded noise-pop bands around, taking the best of modern  without adopting the dogmatic "indie" stance that plague so many bands in..., well..., cities."
