"Truth needs no laws to defend it. Throughout history, only lies and liars have resorted to the courts to enforce adherence to dogma. Nobody jails people who claim to Elvis is still alive. There is no law against denying Santa Claus exists. Nobody is prosecuted for claiming to see Bigfoot. People who think that Lee Harvey Oswald did NOT act alone are not sent to prison. What is it about the history of WW2 we have been taught that is so delicate that all questioning must be stamped out?"

Synopsis: 
Judea Declares War on Germany: A Critical Look at WWII. This movie takes you on a journey back in time. Hosted by Dr. Fredrick Toben, this intriguing documentary shows a little-known aspect of WWII, in which Jews at one time declared war on Germany. In response to this, many Jews were incarcerated in prison camps, similar to what America did to the Japanese. Some Germans even claim that prior to the war's end when supply lines were cut and starvation and disease was rampant, Jews were treated more humanely than the Japanese in American prison camps. See what such talk is based on. Many rare photographs, and some surprising footage showing the prison camps as they are today.
