A friend and I got the assignment to make a full 5-minute movie in a weekend, from our school. All we got from the school was a camera and a deadline. The rest we had figure out ourselves. We spent the first day making up the idea, finding scenery and that stuff. The next day we shot the scenes and the third was planned for editing. However we never finished the final project, but we had to make a test-movie to show our teacher, to see what she thought about the idea. She liked it.

What you are about to see is only a "dummy", and was actually just a one-shot scene that we took just to see if the camera settings were right. But due the deadline we decided to put some cheap effects on it and give it to our teacher.

Now, as you read this were working on the final project which will be seeded as soon as it's finished.

And just a final note. Some of you might notice that the caption says "Hishschool Dropout" that is ofcourse a spelling error that we first found out about when we showed it to some friends. Ofcourse the caption should've said "Highschool Dropout", sorry about that. My friend is a retard :)

Please tell us what you think and comment it as much as you want, and feel welcome to post some ideas for the final project.
