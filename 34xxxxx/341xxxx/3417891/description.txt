  | Started in 1999 by Randy Butman , Jay Fossen, and Richard Brunelle  |
  | (ex-Morbid Angel guitarist), Paths of Possession is a solid mix of  |
  | traditional heavy metal with influences of melodic Swedish death    |
  | metal. Paths of Possession independently released their first CD    |
  | ôLegacy In Ashesö in 2000 but their next release wasnÆt until 2003, |
  | which was a split EP with Dark Faith titled ôThe Crypts Of Madnessö |
  | which is where George ôCorpsegrinderö Fisher (Cannibal Corpse       |
  | vocals) first entered the band. In 2004 Richard Brunelle was        |
  | replaced by current guitarist Jack Goodwin and current member Nick  |
  | Goodyear stepped in to take over drumming duties. Paths of          |
  | Possession played locally around Florida when George wasnÆt         |
  | recording or out on tour with Cannibal Corpse, which unfortunately  |
  | didnÆt leave much time for a full US tour. 2005 saw Paths enter     |
  | Mana Recording Studios/Razzor Media in St. Petersburg, FL to record |
  | Promises in Blood, their first full length in five years, with      |
  | renowned metal producer Erik Rutan (Hate Eternal, Soilent Green,    |
  | and Into The Moat). Once the recording was finished, Promises in    |
  | Blood was sent off to West West Side in NY to be mastered by Alan   |
  | Douches best known for his work with artists such as Nile,          |
  | Sepultura, Hatebreed, Clutch, Unearth, The Misfits, Mastodon,       |
  | Shadows Fall, The Dillinger Escape Plan, Converge, and Earth Crisis |
  | just to name a few. With this much collective talent on board the   |
  | end result is one hell of a brutal yet catchy metal album that is   |
  | sure to ensnare its unsuspecting victims into its malevolent        |
  | whirlwind of headbanging and fist pumping metal.                    |
  |                                                                     |
