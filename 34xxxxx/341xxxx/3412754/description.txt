 BOX HYPE:
 
 Special Forces lead the way in the secret war for control of the world's most
 strategic locations. The first Expansion Pack* to Battlefield 2 takes all-out
 modern warfare behind the scenes for the battles you don't see on the nightly
 news. Become an elite soldier or insurgent in intense online battles as you
 unleash the latest weaponry on land, in the air, and at sea. With authentic
 Special Forces firearms, a full arsenal of technologically advanced gadgets,
 and night-fighting stealth tactics, the covert armies give you even more
 weapons in your fight for the new world order. 
 INSTALLATION:
 
 Mount with daemon-tools 4.x and install+play, didnt need any sd4hide for this
 one. Use 45ZR 8F58 7365 Z436 5437 as key.
 Note that his is an addon, so you will need cracked/clonecd/original release.
 Tested successfully with the reloaded copy. Both the original and the addon
 seem to work fine. Note that the installer for special forces will update
 your main game exe to v 1.1 so you might need the have the original untouched
 exe in the installdir.
 GROUP LOVE:
 
 Nothing here to see
