A PacMan clone....with weed.  Your job is to guide Lane, the lonely stoner, to find his lost nuggets while avoiding the fuzz.  Take a bong hit to make yourself invincible and take out those pigs.  Grab the elusive potleaf for bonus points.

P.S.  Those things that look like spinning turds are actually nuggets of really good weed.
