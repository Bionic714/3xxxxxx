,okonomiyaki,2011-02-28T00:52Z,"Wikipedia has a list of each episode..
""Life.On.A.Stick.1x06.PDTV.XViD-1HA.avi"" is the real episode 6..
""Life On A Stick 1.06 Things People Stand For.avi"" is actually episode 8..

And the unaired pilot is pretty much same as episode 1, except a different actor plays Gus.."
