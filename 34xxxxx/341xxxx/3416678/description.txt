This is a complete collection of the sit-com Life on a Stick. It features all five that aired in the US, as well as the 8 other episodes that aired in Finland. Furthermore, it also includes the original pilot.

I have included the highest quality version I have been able to obatin of every episode. Eps 1+2 are included as HRHDTV (I also included the regular HDTV-versions for those wishing to use stand-alone players). Eps 3-5 are included in standard HDTV-rips. THe episodes that aired in Finland have been labeled differently by different sources, and I have no way of telling which scheme is correct. The episodes contained herein, come from two different sources, so please be aware that this torrent includes 13 unique episodes, even though it has two episode 6, and no episode 8.

Unfortunately, one of the sources for the finnish episodes capped in wrong aspect ratio, thusly I have chosen to use the alternative source for all available eps. Moreover, the alternative source has higher quality as well.

Please be aware that:

Life On A Stick 1.13.avi
are all stretched to 16:9, while they should have been 4:3. However, you can fix this in vlc media player.
