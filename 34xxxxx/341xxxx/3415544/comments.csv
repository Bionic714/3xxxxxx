,no-jotsu,2008-06-06T17:27Z,"Please seed more, this thread/torrent isn't very visited and without seeders it'll die. I'll seed as well when I finish downloading the files...Hope they work. I have been searching the web for sometime now looking for customization programs, but in the free section, because if you pay then you could as well go and buy vista or mac...."
