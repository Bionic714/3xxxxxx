This is the working torrent.  There was a temp file in the first (http://thepiratebay.org/details.php?id=3415347) that was just taking up 10 extra mb.  So I trashed it and am reseeding.  Sorry for the inconvience.  Trust me, this is a good series!  I'll keep the deep house waggon rolling!

Well here is disc 2 of the Bargrooves: Cosmopolitan CD set
