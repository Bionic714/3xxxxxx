Capetown 
This FSQuality scenery add-on for the Microsoft
Flight Simulator represents a rendition of the
airport of the southafrican city of Capetown in
unprecidented detail. But you will not only find
the airport, Stefan Rausch also added a lot of
buildings to let you recognise the city at the
cape of good hope in its entirety.
On a recent trip to Capetown Stefan Rausch
took the oportunity to collect material, necessary
to render the city's airport aswell of many
buildings and sights of the city enabling him not
only to design the city's airport in highes detail,
but also add a the skyscrapers of downtown
Capetown and the famous waterfront with its
