,Knost,2006-01-23T18:01Z,Has anyone gotten the tomtom 5.2 working on their Qvga phone?
,Knost,2006-01-23T18:04Z,"I can start the original version from TomTom and click on the ""I agree"" confirmation. Then the program starts and asks me to register. But then if i apply the cracked version over and click ""I Agree"" the phone waits a few secs and the program closes down. Any ideas?"
,pete75,2006-01-25T20:43Z,"You need to create a folder in storagemy documents called TomTom. You can do this in filemanager or by connecting your fone to your pc. Then just put any old (jpg)picture file in that new folder and it will work. For some reason Tom Tom needs this folder to start the program but wont create it itself!!!
I had this problem on my new SPV C600 and the above fixed it."
,groot,2006-01-29T11:07Z,"Help
I have installed this on my c550 but after setting mile/kilometers and voice it says that their is no maps found. I do have the gb map on my card but does it need to be in a certain folder.
Thanks in advance"
,Knost,2006-02-02T20:05Z,"I added a folder called TomtTom and added a little jpg file there, but its still not working. For some reason i can start the original version 5.2, but then since i dont have a serial key i cant start it. Then i overwrite with the cracked key and then i cant start it more than i get the i agree screen thats all. And it quites the application after like 5-10 secs."
,Knost,2006-02-07T20:13Z,Finally got it working :)
,ANDY999,2006-03-02T11:14Z," FOR SPV C 600: I have all the files on the root of the SD card. I over wrote TOMTOM folder with the upgraded version from the main site. I have created a new tomtom folder in main storage/my docs, and added a jpg. I have copied the CRACK from here. I think all is well.??
I run the file and it doesn't come up with the green (i agree screen) but goes through the set up.  Miles, Time, Voice (which is always DANSK) and then find the mmap but insists I activate it properly, and obviously the coses I have are not accepted on TOM TOM. Please can someone tell me what I'm doing wrong, I been at this for weeks and weeks.
Thank you to whome ever responds

,KL1127,2006-04-17T00:01Z,"Okay, now I've got it to work and I placed the Scandinavian maps in the root of the storage card. - But I can't get TomTom to connect to my GPS reciever. It is not the original TomTom GPS reciever, but I have paired it with my Qtek 8310. Anyone who knows how I get TomTom to ""talk"" to it, I have set TomTom to use ""Other GPS reciever"".

,KL1127,2006-04-17T16:11Z,"And then suddenly it worked... Sorry, I don't know how, it just suddenly connected. I have started and closed the application and closed and turned on the phone several times now, and it still works... 

I think I used three different torrents from here, and then I took a little something from one and some from the other and the last from the third, then it worked..."
,desymc,2006-05-05T22:35Z,This Torrent is only a very small file and not the exe file as described. Can anyone help please. I'm trying to crack the tomtom update for the spv c600. Thanks
[V],felch,2006-08-11T17:34Z,"I had a previous version of TomTom Mobile 5, and used the registry tweak to make the screen work on my Orange SPV C550.

I used the update from http://www.tomtom.com/updates/ttmupd520.zip and copied the folders that this Windows program creates onto the old folders on my smartphone's Storage Card.

It asked for Activation, and I replaced the TomTom Mobile 5.exe (smartphone program) with the one in this ZIP, directly onto the phone, and now it works perfectly!   Thanks - got it in one go!"
