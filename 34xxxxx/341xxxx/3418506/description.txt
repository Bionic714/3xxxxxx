Found this one today on the Net, somewhere in France. Since a lot of people like me are waiting for this, I'd thought I share. Now don't shoot me for doing something wrong with this Torrent thing. Normaly I'm on the download side but I felt the need to share this file so bare with me.

It is the cracked TomTom Mobile.exe version 5.20 (nov. 2005) for Windows Smartphone and enables to use TomTom Mobile on QVGA devices, including Windows Mobile 5 QVGA devices. A Symbian crack is out there allready.

How to use:
Install the official TomTom Mobile 5.20 patch from the TomTom site and replace the TomTom Mobile.exe in the TomTom directory with this cracked one. Enjoy.

If you like the software, buy..... erh..... USE IT!!! (serious, this is the most lame remark in NFO's, isn't it)
