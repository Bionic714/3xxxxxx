I have used TGE and never had any trouble. I compile and run he torque_demo. With TSE there is no torque_demo.exe. I compile and there is nothing to run. I figured out you can just use the torque_demo.exe from TGE and it works fine. But now I have a bug in Torque and this version fixes it. So I can use torque_demo.exe I need to run TSE?s exe file. There has to be some one out there that uses TSE. If so how do you run your games? The readm file talks about compiling but has nothing about running.

i can't get TSE running

i downloaded, extracted and installed DirectX SDK.
i extracted Torque Shader Engine v01x.

but then.... Open (Your Extract Path)""\vc6\Tse SDK.dsw"" in VS 6  or vs.net 

What program is that??? (i tried visual C++ 2005) but when i open the ''Tse SDK.dsw'' file. it has a lot of problem and when i try to build the files in the program it fails.
