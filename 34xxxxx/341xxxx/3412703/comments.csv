,Sixer,2006-02-10T15:16Z,"If the images is uncompressed, which I assume, it's already iso. DMG is often equal to ISO. Just rename it and burn away."
,moosemoose,2006-02-27T19:30Z,if you're having trouble burning a dmg you should just buy a mac ;-)
,moosemoose,2006-03-01T18:31Z,is this patched for generic x86 installs?
