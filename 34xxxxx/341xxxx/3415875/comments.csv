,harigata,2008-10-20T02:40Z,"Errrr..... would anyone, by any chance, have Part III?"
,harigata,2008-10-21T02:48Z,"I guess I've embarrassed myself. Being a Russian and all..... Part III was never completed, and most of the footage was  destroyed by papa Stalin. Eisenstein died of heart attack at 50 at about the time all that happened. Guess it wasn't easy being a gifted artist in Russia those days, if ever.

At any rate - many thanks for the upload, mate! Also, I think the quality is as good as can be expected with such an old Soviet piece, so I gave it a '+'."
