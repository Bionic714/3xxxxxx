This is the complete DVD except without the 30 second radio spots.  I tried everything 
and couldn't get them off of here.  I think its because of the way set up. All the other 
extras are included. Trailers, Bio of Sylvia Kristel, Poster and Still Gallery, The Joys of 
Emmanuelle 2, DVD covers (custom), and part of the nfo from the original downloaded 
source DVD.  The sound on everything else besides the movie is MP3.  The stills are 
PNG's because they are lossless and MUCH smaller than BMP's.

The movie's language is English. Some of the extras are French but have English subs.

XviD codec: http://www.xvidmovies.com/codec/
AC3 codec: included.  In the properties, look for Gains and turn the master up all the way so it won't be too low.

The first movie, Emmanuelle, is on this server.

The custom covers are not by me but by the poster of the DVD source.
