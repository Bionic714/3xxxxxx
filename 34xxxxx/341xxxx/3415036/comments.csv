,Joreth,2008-10-20T16:57Z,"This torrent gives me 57 .rar files and the movie itself is located in only 2 of them (part 1 in #22 and part 2 in #44), neither of which I can open.  My unzip program tells me there's a ""bad block error"".  This is a large and worthless file with these issues.  Anyone have just the 2 .avi files of the movie?"
,xvegetarianx,2008-12-04T15:56Z,"I have all 3 of the original Emmanuelle movies on DVD, all in original French with language options of spoken English and/or French/English Subtitles! Including all the DVD Extras with animated menu, trailers, interviews, image galleries, and more!

I want to upload them, only when I extracted the files to mpg files, the English is not there and I can't figure out how to extract the movies to mpg as subtitled or English spoken versions!

I can easily upload all three movies as French only, but it would be much nicer if I could have English versions with them!

I could however include 3 RDF files, which are exact duplicates of the DVD's, only whoever downloads the RDF files won't be able to watch them till after they burn them to disc first, and not everyone has a DVD Burner yet, so I would really like to upload the mpg files if I can figure out how to make separate mpg files with spoken English and subtitle options!

Any help would be greatly appreciated."
