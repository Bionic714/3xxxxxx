,wreave,2006-01-21T14:31Z,"No sound.  I tried several different things, then even used RatDVD to burn it to a DVD.  No sound even in my DVD player.  Also, I noticed that other torrents of this concert have no sound.  Seems intentional."

,Weequay2,2008-03-15T04:27Z,"stupid ratdvd format.  Please learn to upload properly.

Audio is also nice to have sometimes too."

2. the audio problem is a setting in dvd audio options. I changed it from pcm stereo to Dolby Digital and it works fine
