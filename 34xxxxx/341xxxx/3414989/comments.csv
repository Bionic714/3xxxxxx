,Chinami,2006-01-22T20:40Z,"Hi,

Where can i find subtitles for this? Anyone?

Thanx"
,M0rchant,2006-02-15T19:01Z,I have finished downloading Episode 203 and the audio is acting weird... it's mono with only the music and background sounds... no dialogs... is it just me?
,tamoso,2006-02-17T09:47Z,"perhaps this is a dumb question, but are these files in english? im curious since the original uploader is foreign and someone previously asked for subtitles.  It would help to know before downloading a 3.4 gig file.  Thanks in advance."
,malinho,2006-04-08T23:26Z,Tusen takk!
,lorentzensingapore,2006-04-10T15:54Z,Are these files in English or in Swedish please? Can someone please please seed?
,alonemanteam,2006-04-18T19:01Z,This is in english we in sweden never dub stuff is only the stupid french and german.
,jerry_88,2006-04-19T17:52Z,"I just saw a comment from tamoso, and i just want to say that off course is it english language.
I have never ever downloaded a tv show like this with a translation. 
And for all of you that wants subs, www.undertexter.se thats the biggest subtitles site in sweden, enjoy. And this torrent is going great right now."

(=  would apriciate if someone would give me a resonable answear on that.. thanx... and hope I manage to dowload this on my own... seed or no seeding.... heh.. (=  thanx... og for de som skjønner dette, må gjerne gi svaret på sitt eget språk... regner med at det evt. bare kan bli svensk norsk el. dansk...  "
