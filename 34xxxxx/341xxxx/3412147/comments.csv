,jeffjeffmynameisjeff,2008-02-19T18:17Z,"I'll be happy to seed, that is as soon as the entire material has been seeded. I'm stuck at 97.0%, and so are a few others."
,jeffjeffmynameisjeff,2008-02-24T12:25Z,"Still stuck at 97.0%, and have been for at least a week and a half."
,jeffjeffmynameisjeff,2008-02-29T09:25Z,Still stuck... Just come on and seed for about 2 hours and then I'll be happy to seed for a few weeks. 
,jeffjeffmynameisjeff,2008-03-06T23:39Z,"It says I started downloading the torrent on 15/02/08. Today it's the 6/03/08, and still the same result."
,jeffjeffmynameisjeff,2008-03-16T15:27Z,"It may seem as if I'm littering the torrent, but that's because I want what I'm downloading. I'd be happy to seed for about 8 weeks as soon as you post the entire thing. email me at:

Tell me about the torrent, and why you haven't seeded please."
,frettboard,2008-03-25T17:02Z,Can someone please seed this. It would be nice to actually get beyond 97%. 
,miscom,2008-03-31T00:16Z,"please seed this! Love this girl, and if someone help me get it I will keep seeding for some time.. :)"
,Juggalo-Frost,2010-05-21T19:59Z,"You know, at 97.4 percent you can always decompress the rar to get all the pictures.

Only problem with that is the July4th.wmv 
wont decompress because its incomplete"
