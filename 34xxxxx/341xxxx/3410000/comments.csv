,mrschillingjr,2007-02-27T03:56Z,"Though I did not download it myself, if AVG found a virus, it is must definitely infected, ut AVG also tend to pick things that arent really all that harmful and say they are. Its most likely just sending all of your personal info to some stranger on the internet, could be the poster, yourself, even that creepy bald guy down the street. I would suggest not downloading it, games like that leave some seriously hardcore and extremely difficult to get rid of viruses and spy/ad ware."
