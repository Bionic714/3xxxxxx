Like many teenage rockers of the late '90s, Eve 6 gets by on brash attitude as much as musical skills. That's not to say that the Los Anglees trio isn't talented or ambitious; far from it, as a matter of fact. The group's sound is based in nervy punk-pop, but it has strong '70s hard rock underpinnings, and the harmony vocals of Jon Siebels  and Max Collins exhibit a good pop sense. Often, the trio can pull it all together and come up with infectious pop gems. Almost as often, they get close to their goal, but fail to find the right hook to push them over the edge; they're not the accomplished pop songwriters that, say, Ash were at a similar age. Still, the songs that work are pretty impressive, and Eve 6 shows enormous potential for a debut, especially when the trio's age is factored into account.
