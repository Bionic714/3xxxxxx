,pbtutor,2006-12-07T01:10Z,"seems nice app from the description, but too bad that the serial is not accepted (""invalid"") and so naslite itself cannot be used here"
[V],dodgy4,2007-01-24T11:40Z,"Does anyone know, the login for this, i have tried admin/nas , but to no avail."
,kiwiruss,2007-05-21T19:46Z,"NASLite 2 CDD and USB please.

,Huliganen,2007-06-01T18:14Z,"How do I make i boot from this image. 

My burningprogram says no bootable image."
,poon!!,2007-07-23T01:55Z,After that you have burnt the extracted iso you have to go to the CD that you burned and from there go to the directory called img. In that directory you have 3 different images that you have to burn to CD. The easiest is if you mount the first image that you downloaded witn daemon tools or similar and the get the selected image to burn from there.
,poon!!,2007-07-23T01:57Z,"I was a bit unclear before. 
You only have to select one of 
the iso images in the img folder. "
,CrabbySteve,2008-01-25T07:51Z,"The serial number has an error:
Instead of 592H1,
it should be:
529H1

Then it'll work just fine!!!"
,zztoppy,2008-08-04T19:48Z,"NASLite-2 USB is here: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4326628/NASLite-2_USB

But it needs cracking..."
,Wartickler,2008-10-18T10:19Z,"Beautiful work...key is correct, just make sure to use CAPS and it needs the hyphens ( - )"
,ziggy74,2008-11-09T23:42Z,"has anyone else been able to get this serial to work?  It will not accept the provided number even with 529H1, as valid. All caps and hyphens included."
