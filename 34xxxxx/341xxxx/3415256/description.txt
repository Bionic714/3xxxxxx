            NASLite+ is a CD-ROM based Network Attached Storage (NAS) 
            Server Operating System designed to transform a basic computer
            into a dedicated SMB/CIFS, NFS, FTP and HTTP file server. 
            NASLite+ is intended primarily for use in a small business or 
            home office network. It is capable of handling 50 or more
            workgroup users easily and efficiently even when running on 
            modest hardware. By design, NASLite+ is a community workgroup 
            server and does not support features such as user management,
            disk quotas or the ability to join domains. 
            However, it is very easy to set-up, to administer and to use.
