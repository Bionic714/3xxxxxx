iMDB Comment:

Marcelo Masagão did the best thing when he used the money he got for doing a CD ROM and made a movie. Its his first directing job. He made a kind of collage of all the important images and stories of the 20th century. His purpose was to talk about the banalization of death through the wars. The way he chose to do this was astonishing. Stories of anonymous people tied up all the world History, making us really think about what death became to us as humans. A great movie, I hope it becomes part of the obligatory movies list, because it represents our century in a way no other director had done until now. Long live Masagão!
