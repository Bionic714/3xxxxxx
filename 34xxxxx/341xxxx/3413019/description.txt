Powerword2006, a Chinese/English translation software. It works instantaneous (in both ways), you move the cursor above a word on a text (Word, PDF, etc.) and you'll have the translation in a small box. Don't know so much more but you need to have Chinese language installed of course. It seems to work though.
It is made by a company named Kingsoft.
