Pyramid-building aliens are controlling the world from their hyperspace corridor to Neptune, taking the form of Gay Jews, who are infiltrating your governments and even your families! I'M SCARED MOMMY! Bwahahahahahahaha! .... No, really, pity the fuckin' freaks."
,dystop,2006-03-05T03:04Z,"The thing I'm wondering is this: does it matter if he's an antisemite?

This man seriously thinks that lizards from outer space is controlling the world and eating human babies as lunch.
No really, he does.

The man is obviously stark raving mad, I wouldn't be a bit suprised if he fits the jews into this masterplot too... but c'mon. He's a mentalcase, if a junkie that lives in the street calls me jewbastard I don't call him nazi, I pity him since he has obviously lost his mind."

For those who wanna wake up of the illusion i say pay more attention to the work David Icke does.

For those who choose not to : go away and take the red pill."
,Rotpada,2008-01-03T19:36Z,Is this really from the BBC?
,Guzzla,2008-02-13T11:34Z,"The funny thing is that this man in the year 1990 wrote about New Orleans and 9/11 the comments here are clearly by closed ""in society minds"" do some yoga for peep sake.

Keep on seeding!"
,d4mon1,2008-03-10T13:50Z,"David Icke is not anti semitic, not a racist, and definatly not mad. If people actually bother to read his books, listen to his talks and lectures, hear him on the radio shows that are not scared to have him as a guest, will see that he is a intellectual man who has done lots of research and is brave enough and prepared to tell the people what he has found out. no matter how far fetched it sounds. It is just information, and information is power. David icke could not give a damn what your views, your religion, or your thoughts of him and what he says. He does not expect anyone to beleive him, its up to you what you beleive and what you dont. ITS CALLED FREEDOM. I have all his material and seen him live in london. It does not matter to me if he is right or not. But living my life with the belief that he may be right changes the way i see the world. When you do this you dont fall for the FEAR created to keep you controlled. Dont be afraid to express your views. even if you get ridiculed. I respect david icke for what he does. takes great courage. Read his stuff, listen to him and understand his point. Then decide on waht you think. make your own mind up. most people who call him a nutter have NEVER even read a book or listemed to him. WHO IS THE FREE ONE!

peace. "
,eastern876,2008-06-03T10:22Z,"All David Icke fans will be extremely interested to get the following torrent:

In the 1980s, radio station KABC carried the ground-breaking radio program ""OPEN MIND"" with host Bill Jenkins.   The subject matter covered included UFOs, alternative energy, spirituality, ancient religions, and more.   Bill Jenkins later went on to host the classic film ""THE NAKED TRUTH"" with Jordan Maxwell, upon which the current internet hit ""ZEITGEIST"" is based.

The ""Open Mind"" radio programs have not been heard in many years ... until now.   We recently came into possession of a large collection of cassette tape recordings which had been made by a loyal listener, and had them digitized into MP3s.  This is a priceless collection of otherwise unattainable radio programs.   It is being freely shared here in an effort to make sure it is not lost to  history.

,Zero2ninE,2008-06-04T00:06Z,"This guy has just lost it! And why do jews even give a shit what he says? Freedom of speech my ass, he has the right to say what EVER he wants (even if it's blindfaced LUNACY), they have no right to do what they do to him. This is one big farce, from both sides, top to bottom! Don't waste your bandwidth on this, unless of course you need a laugh. And how the hell come people want to pay money for reading, watching or listening to this rubbish is beyond me. Well why did I watch this? It had a weird title, and I have a thing for weirdness... hell I thought even the guy's name was weird. He should have found a psychiatrist, not a psychic. He has all the hallmarks of a schizophrenic:
1) He's the messiah
2) He's been hearing voices
3) He has extremely paranoid delusions
4) He's actuallt seen these lizard-people...

WTF!?!?

I mean come on guys, don't believe EVERYTHING. Just because it's passed through the lense of a camera and on the telly, doesn't make it true."
,lewisfriend,2008-07-12T02:38Z,"I don't believe in lizard people from outer space any more than I believe that some guy can turn water into wine but I do belive that people should be allowed to express their views freely. This documentary shows how people's right to free speech can be denied. The same methods are used agains people who express their views on war, poverty, corruption, the environment and other important issues."
,nonamedood,2009-02-01T18:51Z,"All I know is that Jews have been terrorizing everyone around them for a full century. History has conveniently forgotten the terrorist organizations Jews had in the 20s and 30s targetting Palestinian officials and civilians alike. Following the 1967 war where they illegally confiscated the West Bank and Gaza, which they still occupy illegally and continue to terrorize and humiliate their peoples - and then they are puzzled why they get rockets..."
