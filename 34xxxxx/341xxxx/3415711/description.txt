Ecstacy of the Angels (Koji Wakamatsu, 1969)
This is another movie from Wakamatsu and it is a bit different from Go go second time virgin. If GGSTV was more of say Bergman this one is more like Godard. Between EOTA and GGSTV is it only about 4 years and in that time Wakamatsu made 25 movies. About the other movies and i don't know anything. The rip for this one and GGSTV is not made by me, it is made by some unknown guy or girl out there on the net.So my thanks is for the unknown ripper.I guess this one might belong in the asiantorrents  section but it is also Freaky.
