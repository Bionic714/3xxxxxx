So you've seen all our raw dumps? but what can you use them for?
       Nothing in their current form, yet! - But here we go with a nice
       extractor tool so that you can extract the dumps and check out
       the files, we even decided to release the source code, so that
       you can figure out the filesystem and make even nicer tools and
       clean up our horrible looking code, cause we are lazy and old!
       Usage: extract360.exe gamename.360 <wildcard>...
       For example:
          extract360.exe pi-nfsmw.360
       Sit back and relax, and enjoy, these xbox360 games are quite
       large!
       And a note to the tech guys:
         Yes, once you get past the protections and down to the raw
       bits on the disc, its just the standard xboxdvdfs, however the
       offset and layer breakpoint are different!
                               / Team PI Coder - over and out!
