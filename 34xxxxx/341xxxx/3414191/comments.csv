[V],pery1010,2006-05-26T00:29Z,"extremly good and nice collection...HOWEVER.....some of the best clasical songs are DESTROYED...by some seconds of noice. But if YOU are able to fix these, or buy an originale the overall dowload is goood. Have a good life."
,gyimbow,2006-05-31T01:11Z,"Very Good!!! Pls Seed!
Thx!"
,timidbullcreations,2006-07-31T09:44Z,"Great collection, not quite all, a few missing albums, some albums are missing songs.  All in all it is a great collection, easy enough to fill in the blanks.  For example on final cut, ""three suns in the sunset"" is missing ""a collection of dance songs"" album is also not there. as well as a few rare ones.  Anyways, thanks man for the great work of putting this all together. "
,mvernon,2006-08-11T22:36Z,"bunch of crap.  many songs have no ID3 tag at all.  others have very poor tagging.  others contain fragments of other pink floyd songs overlaid part way through.

Don't download if you are expecting quality.  On the other hand, if you like shitty torrents, be my guest."
,mvernon,2006-08-11T22:51Z,"sorry, ignore my previous comment.  Me stupid.  Torrent not completely downloaded...."
,mvernon,2006-08-11T22:54Z,another good example of why it's important to MAKE SURE you are right before toasting someone else's hard work.

,UFOelectric,2006-10-09T23:23Z,"Quote:Darkdays Ehh, there isn't a ""Is there anybody out there""-album in the torrent.. 


Yes there is an album called ""Is there anybody out there"", its the ""proper title"" for the wall live album thats from various recordings from '80-81.
"
,UFOelectric,2006-10-09T23:30Z,"Quote:Tallz:Although I would have also included The Man And The Journey also.....

Tallz, the man and the journey bootleg is in the torrent, please read the top of this page where it says:

1969 - The Man & The Journey (14 songs)

:) have fun"
,UFOelectric,2006-10-09T23:33Z,"Kimkake, your right, ""Hey You"" on the ""is there anyboyd out there"" live wall album is fk'd up.  Another ""unknown"" random song cuts in 40 secs in or so. 

Someone really needs to fix this torrent and reseed the new torrent.  A few songs are missing and the wall live album is ruined!!!

Plus adding more live albums and bootlegs, demo's, the bbc sessions etcc would make this even better.  Imagine a 10GB PFLOYD TORRENT."

,rlgarlitz,2007-02-18T11:36Z,"I iwll seed, as it jsut finished for me. But I do so in protest. This Torrent SUCKS. Ive been through a few different pink floyhd discographies, this one is missing the first disc of Ummagumma, which IMO is the better half.. Also, San Tropez is not on meddle, and Im seeing names repeated 2-5 times in a single album.. dont rememeebr which one, but 5 our of 7 songs were all named One of these days on aspecific album. Highly dissatisfied.. ill seed for as long asit takes me to find a decent one then im riding my computer of it. Ill post the link if I find a good one"
