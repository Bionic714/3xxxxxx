,scott_b,2006-01-14T02:10Z,"[Quote]The XDA Exec that I was testing on did not display the TomTom bar in the Today screen, even when it was specifically enabled. I think this is to do with incompatibility with Windows Mobile 5.0.[/quote]

I installed a version  i had onto my M5000 and the only problem was that it kept saying no maps found! I had the tom tom bar in the today screen though, so it can work with WM5.

go here it works a treat"
,nnip,2006-05-16T19:30Z,"If you still have a trouble with your GPS, try to run any other GPS software in background (i used VisualGPSce (configured with Com port)) and configure TomTom to use 'other NMEA device' with bitrate 4800 and shared with other application COM port. Both of these application should use the same COM port."
,stephanbiemans,2006-05-25T15:01Z,"ey bithchucker,
may thanx for the tips, i followed them all. Unfortenately it still doesn't work. When I want to select a incomming com-port for GPS, i can only choose from com6 or com 7. I chose com 6 for incomming and 7 for outgoing. Running tt5 i wanted te select com7 for the GPS signal. But the srceen only showed com0+2+3+9 and seriel port. I would like to change the incomming com in one of those but the buetooth doens't allow me: i can only choose 6 or 7. Do somebody know how to solve this problem?? "
