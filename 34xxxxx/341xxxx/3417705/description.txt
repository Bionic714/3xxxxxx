ABSTRACT: Article about the staging of scenes for the western media by the Palestinians. The al-Dura case cited as an example.

QUOTE: "You can't blame the Palestinians," says the Palestinian. "This is the way they were trained, to be loyal, not to air the dirty laundry, this is media in the Arab world," he says. "Unfortunately 100% of the fixers see themselves as foot soldiers in the revolution. They will not tell foreign journalists anything that reflects badly on the PA." As an Israeli journalist notes, they are also starving, and most can be bought for $50. Consequently, Western reporters rely too heavily on spokesmen like Nabil Sha'ath and Sa'eb Erekat; when a corruption scandal hits the news, they are surprised."
