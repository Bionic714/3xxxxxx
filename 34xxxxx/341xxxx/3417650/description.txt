 Compiler Versions...: XDK 5933, Visual Studio .NET 2003

 Custom Mods.........: Custom mplayer.dll compiled from latest CVS with GCC 3.4.4
                       using --disable-libavformat. Greatly reduces the size of 
                       the dll at the cost of not being able to demux a few
                       obscure formats.
                       WMV9, RealVideo and Quicktime codecs included and tested. 

 Notes...............: Went back to regular rar format per request, so no
                       fancy installer this time ;)
