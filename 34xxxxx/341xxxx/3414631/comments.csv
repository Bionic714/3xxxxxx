the only film still banned in recent times is Ken Park ,for similar reasons."

,Posthumane,2006-01-12T01:56Z,"I have seen this movie in the past and I must admit it's good to see it's going around on the net.

This is a must see for any serious film fan in my opinion."

,ConorThePerv,2006-09-05T21:06Z,"Incredible!!!
Once again you've posted a masterpiece.
Thanx Dude!"
,daveggg,2007-01-03T17:58Z,"TOTAL CRAP!!

This movie is so bad that it is just TOTALLY unbelievable!! The plot, the acting, the music, basically EVERYTHING is just sooo pathetic and stupid. It only gets attention because the shitty actors actually fuck for real. Get a porno instead, the acting will probably be better.

TOTAL CRAP!!!"
[M],jenka,2007-01-29T04:20Z,"srsly, 73800+ downloads! :p
if I know that I had uploaded it myself back in the days...

its a good movie!"
,Mister White,2007-02-28T09:02Z,"You can talk any semi-psychological bullshit about this as much as you like but basically, this movie is a sort of low-budget, forgein Thelma & Louise with more violence and more (explicit) sex. And that's about it."
,genestarwind2007,2007-05-04T04:55Z,Looks promising --> Hope it is good as/better Ken Park XD
,badassnoodle,2007-07-20T18:21Z,"

,ekc,2007-10-07T22:49Z,"The subtitle did not work for me, but i found page that had one for this relase in english.
http://www.opensubtitles.org/sv/subtitles/152839/baise-moi-en"
,8475647476574,2007-12-24T21:05Z,"Same goes for me: the subtitles that come with this torrent  don't run with VLC. The subtitles that ekc linked to (http://www.opensubtitles.org/sv/subtitles/152839/baise-moi-en) worked fine.

Probably I am ""totally computer illiterate"", as sickboy88 pointed out in his sweet sensitive way.

Anyway, thank you sickboy88, for making this movie available to us.

Hugs and kisses :-)"

,ANicki_InTheUk,2008-06-09T23:32Z,"i have tried the supplied link (koepi), have looked for vobsub and the specific codec download (filled my computer with adware/spyware/malware), and also tried looking at the swedish site given in comments etc etc and i have been trying for 2 days now to find a way to get or activate english subtitles... can someone tell me a SIMPLE way to watch this movie with english subtitles? I am not a computer genius just a girl who often gets stuff off tpb and sickboy and i've never had these problems ever before. I use vlc i also now have divx and nothing is working!!! AAAARGH!! Please please please SIMPLE SUGGESTIONS!! it will take me another week to download it off klaxxon with my connection speed! "
,ANicki_InTheUk,2008-06-09T23:33Z,HEEEEELLLP!!!!!
,darkko,2008-08-06T21:51Z,damn! there's some serious fucking and sucking goin on in here! don't think i've ever seen a legitimate film where the actors really fuck! 
,rexlaundrette,2008-10-01T01:34Z,"LOVE IT !! What a cracking film, was it released in full screen, no letterbox, disappointed. But thanks anyway Sickboy for upload, I'm still seeding."
,scumbagmisfit,2008-10-22T22:58Z,"ON ANOTER SUBJECT, this year a film was made about a serial killer in a burka, a rare middle eastern horror made this year, I downloaded it then lost it and now can't remember what it's called.... HELP!
P.S Baise moi is a good film"
,sathomaso,2008-12-20T00:42Z,"just finished downloading. video quality (4:3 ratio) and sound are good !!!

but FFS --- my VLC-player (v. 0.9.4) cannot get the subs displayed because as soon as i open the movie there's a popup window saying that the *.sub file cound't be read.

i have tried both but neither the extraced ""Baise_Moi.sub"" from the rar file, nor the ""Baise_Moi (xvid110-sickboy88).idx"" works.

any hints on that?
