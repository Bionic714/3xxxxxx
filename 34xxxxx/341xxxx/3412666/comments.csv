So all the claims that they are part of the NWO is just bullshit from false prophets of the Prophecy club."
,pmsbull,2006-12-05T10:09Z,"I know many Jehovahs Witnesses and they will galdly share information about their faith with anyone who asks. Their organisation is non profit and any donations go towards expanding the availability of / reprinting their magazines and religious publications and spreading their message. They actually run at a loss, existing on donations given on a voluntary basis mostly out of their own pocket. They actually printed articles based on Bible prophecy warning that things like the Illuminati and false religions would come to rise and that these things were a sign that our system of things was coming to an end, warning of the approach of Armageddon.
Does this sound like a secrative all powerful world control system to you ?"
