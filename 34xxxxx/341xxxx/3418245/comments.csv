,wdotstevendotcom,2006-01-26T00:12Z,"you shouldnt even be on this site could9. If you dont know how to use these iso's then dont ask, search for it you idiot. here this site might come in handy for you its www.google.com  you should really think about going to that site."
,zonkodilla,2006-02-08T22:39Z,You only have to use a program like quicks or c-xbox to transfer the hole iso over to the xbox and then is just to play the game! Noob!

,sappy,2008-07-07T10:25Z,This game aint on the Xbox-compabilitylist for 360. Tried to burn it and play anyway but my 360 wont play it. Sad xD

,KillerKellerjr,2008-07-08T21:31Z,To all Morons...this is for the Classic XBOX or XBOX1 if you will.  Most uploaders will state either XBOX360 for XBOX 360 or XBOX for the Original XBOX Classic.  Doesn't take a scientist to figure it out.  Get some common sense people!!!!!
,Garfiield123,2008-09-21T20:19Z,it worked!! thx man! oh yea anyway i wounder  when u are pointing the gun on some1 how do u say freeze?oh and how to u strangle soe one??

,Galtin,2008-10-03T01:32Z,"First off, Garfield, you are a moron.  But since I'm nice I'll provide a few links, http://www.gamefaqs.com and http://www.justfuckinggoogleit.com (even though it's already been posted)  that should take care of just about everything for you.  Stupid people, the internet is a vast wealth of information, what use is it to scorn the vast majority of what's out there just to ask other people?  Secondly, I have a slight problem with this game.  Every time I go through the campaign, it freezes every time partway through the cutscene where ""Raiden"" first meets ""Iroquois Pleskin"", also other aspects of the game just tell me that ""the Disk you are using is damaged or dirty"", I know that's not true because the games resides on my HD, thank you FTP.  If anyone can resolve this issue, or point me to another copy I'd be greatly appreciative.  Yes it's a damn shame that they did away with the VR missions and Snake Tales."
,aanarchyy,2008-11-14T23:23Z,"I tried burning this and it doesn't play.  Do I need to transfer this to the xbox hd?  I dont think i have enough free space.  I can get the xbox to read the dvd and see all the files on it, but when i try to play it, it sticks on the ""Loading MGS2..."" screen.  Can someone possiblly give me a MD5 or SHA1 of the actual ISO so i can compare it to what i have?"
,cm2881,2009-01-10T20:50Z,"This works perfectly, I downloaded and ftp to the xbox using Qwix101 and it is flawless.

Advice... first I burn it into a dvd but it didn;t worked.

Just FYI."

,Jetz,2010-03-03T01:12Z,"WTF???!!! Substance without bonus material???? SERIOUSLY!!! WHAT THE FUCK MAN???!!!! fuck you, wasted my time for this shit, share a real substance with extra material!!!!!!!"
,policema,2010-03-23T11:30Z,"why are peolople such wankers the people who are asking do you need a mod or somthing are only fucking asking and if your not going to help then dont write anything, 
to play these games you need a modded xbox either chipped or softmodded then you need to burn onto a dvd-r not dvd+r i use imgburn for this its a free programe.
back to modding your xbox there are alot of places that have all the info you need just google how to mod my xbox and you should find what your looking for"
,bongripper,2010-09-28T07:44Z,"anyone have the FULL game they can up?
