Lee Byung Hun takes on a hot sister trio in Everybody Has A Little Secret ! 
Korea's super dandy who has appeared in big screen hits like The Harmonium in My Memory and JSA is back this time starring next to Choi Ji Woo (Trap, First Kiss) to bring you this charming remake of About Adam. Lee portrays Soo-hyon, a guy that attracts women like a magnet whose latest catch is Mi-young (Kim Hyo-jin). Originally preferring short passionate affairs, Mi-young does believe that she has found Mr. Right in her new hot flame. It's a shame that Mi-young's eldest sister Jin-young (Chu Sang-mi) who suffers from constant heartbreak is also drawn to Mi-young's love interest. As if all of this didn't add up to enough misunderstandings, the confusion reaches its climax when middle sister Son-young enters the scene and decides to claim Soo-hyon for herself. Who will the attractive philanderer walk off with in the end ? broadminded femme fatale Mi-young, passionate but love-forsaken Jin-young or well-read love amateur Son-young ? Find out in this romantic new comedy import that offers you Korea's latest cinematic flavors.
