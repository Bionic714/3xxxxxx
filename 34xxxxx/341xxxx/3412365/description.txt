Totally Tacky Time

TTT1 is the biggest scandinavian snowboardmovie since the legendary and groundbreaking   ? Scands? came out 10 years ago. Since then there has been a lack of joint scandinavian filmprojects. Once again it is time to show the world what this little corner of the world is able to do on a snowboard. TTT1 is the first taste of a series of films that Tacky will bring you in the years to come.

This film showcases many of the up and coming talents as well as the best established and reckognized riders that Scandinavia has to offer.
The crew, including filmers and riders spent the entire season last year travelling all over the globe for fresh powder and urban streetrails. With the same goal of having fun in the making, the result of this movie is ecceding every expectation with its charmy yet talented appearence.

Enjoy!
