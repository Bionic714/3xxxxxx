Release Notes:
* Fixed problems from previous releases( versions 1 and 2)

* I believe I have found all the adresses I ran at least 100 test and found 10 differant adresses for the infinite health and the infinite sand tanks which is why my previous releases of this trainerdid not always work for everyone nor for myself..however after much labor and hardship I could not find anymore differances and have tested the trainer 20 times with this game and it worked 100% of the time..so with that said here it is folks...

* If by any chance this version of the trainer does not work for you, Note that im currently making  an infinite secondary weapon cheat so if I missed an address for any of these four cheats which I dont believe I did after so many test ill catch it...and correct it in the next release..im really a noob at making trainers but now I got the knack for it. This game uses DMA(Dynamic memory)which means the adresses dont stay the same..more or less..

*Last but definately not least, all apologies to those who downloaded prince of persia the two thrones +2 trainer version 1 and +4 trainer version 2,I will say it again I was a noob and just because my first trainers worked a few times I assumed they were allgood to go and unleashed them on you (the public)..Well I hope this Version will make up for it, and Iook forward to making more now that I know what im doing..
