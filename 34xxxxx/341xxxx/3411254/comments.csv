,Klapg,2009-12-30T15:23Z,thank you very much
,Ratmanslim,2010-04-12T11:49Z,"RCT999 - what's your problem? I guess your speakers are to cheap to produce any quality sound (bad sound kills good music).

This upload is excellent, no problems at all."

,Kromaethius007,2011-05-30T16:52Z,"Bitrate too low and that is why some are complaining a bit. Try 320K or FLAC Lossless, or just go out and buy it.

Thanks for offering this upload."
