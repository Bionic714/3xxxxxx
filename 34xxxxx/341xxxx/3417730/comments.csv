   ""The Boondocks"" is brilliant, absolutely brilliant.  It's refreshing to see intelligent TV like this.  And episode 5 in particular, wow--- what an allegory!  It didn't even hit me until about halfway through what it was all about.  Awesome."

Hehe, anybody who has been in prison would know. NEVER drop the soap! XD"
