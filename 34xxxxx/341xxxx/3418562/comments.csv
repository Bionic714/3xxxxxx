  I am using utorrent and I am downloading this right now, I am also uploading it at the same time. Wouldn't it make more since to stop uploading until after I download the whole thing? Also I can't figure out how to do that in any of the option or anything like that. Please help, I think that would make me download this a lot faster.
  Also does this place have a forum where I could post future topics like this so that I don't spam up the torrent comments?"
