-----===== Team HaxXBox XBox 360 Bootloader v1.0 Beta =====----------

Random crashes and fire aren't the only problems with the new XBox 
360! We have already discovered how to execute unsigned code by 
playing a carefully crafted corrupt MPEG2 file! This allowed us to 
craft a swap disc. We are releasing the bootloader right away because 
we only have one 360 to use for testing, and we need feedback. We 
will begin releasing game images shortly. Please run the disc, and 
send an email describing your results to thblfeedback@cryptomail.org.

How to use:
Step 1: Burn to DVD-R media using Alcohol 120%
Step 2: Begin to play this disc just like a DVD movie.
Step 3: After the into, wait for the countdown. After the countdown 
finishes, a short starfield clip will play and freeze. At this point 
the boot loader will run, and prompt you to swap in another disc. 
Step 4: Eject the boot loader, put in your own disc, and enjoy!
