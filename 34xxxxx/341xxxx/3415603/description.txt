This is Pseudo echo's first album Autumnal park.
It's a CD rip,NOT a crappy vinyl rip.
This album has been almost impossible to get but now it has been Re-mastered and realeased on CD with 3 bonus tracks.
I've encoded this in 256 kbps.
Enjoy.


Tracks:

Autumnal park
A beat for you
See through
From the shore
Stranger in me
Dancing until midnight
Listening
His eyes
Walkaway
Fast cars
Destination unknown
In their time
Turning the pages
