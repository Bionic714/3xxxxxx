Harryhausen-esque dinosaur fights!

	

-TAGLINE-
	"A mystical sorceress... a magical sword... the adventure of a lifetime."

-WHAT THE BACK OF THE CASE SAYS-
	I don't remember, but IMDB lists:

	"A traveling swordsman helps a young girl fight an evil wizard for possession of the magic Knife of Aktar, which gives its owner unlimited power. The girl wants it to help free her imprisoned father, while the wizard is after it for his own nefarious ends."

          Unfortunately less cheezy, but I suppose an accurate enough description.

-WHAT REALLY HAPPENS-
	An out of work body-builder attempts to lift aluminum swords as he for some reason helps a frigid bitch rescue her father from an evil wizard and his equally evil masochistic sidekick. Half-way through it turns into a buddy-flick.

-Notes-
Figures. The week I get this, it gets released on DVD. Oh well.

What to say about Fred Olen Ray. My introduction to him was renting Hollywood Chainsaw Hookers a few years back, without knowing him. My real introduction was with Evil Toons (Starring David Carradine and included this week as the double feature) since he had a nice little intro/special feature on that DVD. Seems like a cool guy, and he has made some of the best-titled movies around. Just look him up on IMDB.

This movie can't decide what time period its in. The dialogue keeps switching from the most god-awful attempt to sound old-english-ish to regular early 90s slang. 

"Hark! We shall seek nourishment in thy nearest village"
"Cool."

The sword fighting is awful. The buddy-sidekick awful. Plot: awful. FX: Awful.
Acting: among the worst. So the good things? Well, besides all those above, the cameo by Lawrence Tierney is actually really good. He does a great job. But the best part is the AWESOME Harryhausen stop-motion dinosaurs! They're short, but it looks so great it will make you want to go watch Clash of the Titans all over again.

I also included the Loyd and Troma's intro, as well as their infomercial and a bunch of awesome trailers including "Cannibal! the Musical" (filmed before the actual movie, with different scenes, and some different actors) and the greatest Troma trailer ever, "Tromeo and Juliet" (LEMMY!)

Be sure to check out Evil Toons, the other Fred Olen Ray film (and a GREAT one!) as the double feature this week!

Why is the resolution so small?

The video and/or audio sucks!
...Well its captured off an amazingly old VHS.

...That's the point.
