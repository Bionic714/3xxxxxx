,ghul,2006-04-18T03:07Z,"don't wanna be ungrateful, but some of the episodes' encodings look really crappy - some were even transferred from videotape. just to say: don't expect perfect HDTV/DVD quality here"
,Omacron,2006-04-28T17:12Z,"HDTV Rip? more like ""Crap definition TV Rip"" recoreded from ""SKyOne"" TV, it quite blurry...
I'll sure Emule for better quality if i wanted HDTV

If your gonna claim something, then make sure you claim it right....But thanks anyways for the effort."
,_-WoK-_,2006-08-18T23:19Z,"The rips from SkyOne are great! More than i expect from a DSR, but ep 18 - 25's quality really sucks. Of course it's wrong to claim that this is HDTV rips."
,consp1racy,2007-01-14T00:07Z,"Where to get good quality episodes for ep 18 - 25's????
I can't find them!?"
,psychodad123,2008-03-26T19:52Z,"Are you sure you even know what HDTV means?
Ep 25 is the crappiest quality I've ever seen!! 320 x 240 is definitely not HD and it looks like it's upscaled from 40x30 pixel."
,Kx80,2008-06-19T09:48Z,any1 have a clue where to find english subs for season 2?
,Lassie_d_dog,2008-08-16T21:19Z,"Nice man!!!

There is crappy quality on 7/25 episodes but they are wachteble. the rest of the episodes are great. the sound is perfect on all the series!!! 

I am already enjoying!"
,12314,2008-10-24T11:01Z,please seed! this show is one of my favorites!
,koopa_troopa,2009-01-30T01:31Z,"great show, would be good if people didnt limit uploading to 1kb/s, then it might take less than a week to get. 

i will leave uplaoding on unlimited for everyone as a seed.

,SEMTEXBHOY,2009-07-14T01:23Z,"yeah the quality of this is not great. the first load of episodes are OK quality but the later episodes are awfull. some of them are unwatchable, due to poor audio and video"
,brunalandfrikki,2010-03-15T11:58Z,wow downloading at 600 kb :D wich is my maxXx
,danielxz1,2011-02-09T20:56Z,"Like SEMTEXBHOY said, latest episodes are unwatchable (A:2 V:2) so i wouldn't download, I'm now trying to get a better quality. "
,CodeFanatic,2011-02-26T17:50Z,"As already mentioned, half of them are bad quality. Episode 18 to 25 are the bad quality ones. There has been one, espisode 19 that is completely awful and noisy. I have managed to watch them though."
,kingman69,2011-12-20T08:53Z,dewey is the best haha
,BKKJack,2012-01-13T01:28Z,"I have to agree that the quality of some of these is dire.

Better to DL one of the ""Complete"" torrents here instead of these. "
