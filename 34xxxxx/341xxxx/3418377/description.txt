Another Selection of Terence McKenna vids.  Some are lectures, some are more formal video productions.  I will be putting up Volume Three in a few days.

Videos are mostly ripped from vcd's (DAT files), so you either need to convert them or simply play them in VLC Media Player, free for all platforms. (Search google for VLC).

Videos included in Volume Two:

Prague Gnosis 1 & 2
Forms and Mysteries 1 & 2
The Last Word (Mpeg file)

Enjoy!
