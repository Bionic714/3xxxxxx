,Occhino,2006-02-08T00:21Z,"Good question, it is by far the worst version of Nothing else matters I've ever heard (kareoke included)! But the jury thought just the opposite, one of the best N.E.M versions they had ever heard, they said. Either, they have been brainwashed by an army of boybands, or else, they are very tonedeaf!"
,MR.Yeah,2006-09-03T20:44Z,"jarco5000 and Occhino, u guys r all wrong! This is a great verision of Nothing else matters, probably as good as the original if not better! And why r u guys even writing if u hate it? then u probably doesnt dl it and u dont have the right 2 write!"
