Kansas' live concert from 2003.

Video: 16x9 Pal Anamorphic
Audio: DD5.1

Re-encoded to fit DVD-5 with Procoder 2-pass. Concert at 4625 kbps and extras at 1847 kbps. There is a sample vob included if you want to check the video quality.

I used Procoder as I prefer it over CCE with interlaced material.

DD2.0-audio removed. Menus untouched. Cover included.

You may find that the concert is a bit grainy. That is intentional as the original film was shot on Super 16mm :)

I have a slow connection so have patience when downloading. And do seed when your done.
