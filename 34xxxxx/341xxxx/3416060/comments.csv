,bkk10700,2007-01-31T12:26Z,"I just finished downloading this. Looks good using Media Player but I'm having trouble burning it to DVD using Nero. I keep getting the message ""file not compatible."" I'm basically computer illiterate so I'd love some advice."
,Mangobodybutter,2007-07-07T07:33Z,"although i havn't downloaded this yet, i have seen this movie and its one of the best movies of all time."

,malanzirotti,2008-03-07T19:16Z,"Will someone upload the movie WOYZEK, please? How about you, IggyPop? Woyzek  is a Herzog's absolute masterpiece!  "
,rogerpP,2008-09-25T20:45Z,Many thanks for this.
,phony,2008-10-30T09:47Z,"This is seriously one of the best movies ever made, I love the part when klaus kinsky is holding the tiny monkey in his hand and says he is the wrath of god.. just great :)

I totally recommend BUYING the Herzog/Kinksy box set from anchor bay (i believe). Just amazing. "
,jacknitro,2008-12-30T00:55Z,"I love Herzog and this film, but I can't get past the awful German dubbing. There's a version with the original English audio track out there."
,sciurus0,2009-02-16T15:31Z,"Is this rip in the correct aspect ratio? Doesn't look like it, but it might be an effect of the subbing."
,m45,2009-03-14T00:40Z,"jacknitro
herzog and kinski are german and the original film is made in german. English would be the dubbed language. There is no ""original"" english audio track
Men n채r man tittar p책 filmen se det faktiskt ut som om det var dubbad tyska (???)"
,m45,2009-03-24T01:12Z,"i take that back, sorry, The film was shot in English but was primarily released in a dubbed German version I found out now"
,Sven the swede,2010-01-27T23:37Z,"The subs are a bit strange, and perhaps there might also be some problem with the aspect ratio as previously mentioned. It might also be the subtitles. Still, I think something feels wrong about the picture. The quality itself is okay. "
,krabbycz,2011-12-21T01:45Z,It's a masterpiece in my collection. Thanks a ton and will seed.
,labaredo,2012-06-03T00:05Z,"I'm really sorry, Iggy, but there's nothing about the hardcoded subtitles, despite loving this film (I watched it several years ago) and the quality of this copy, I won't seed it, actually I will delete it, such is my mood for embeded texts. Shouldn't Freakflicks consider the film preservation? If so, you can count on me. Thanks and sorries."
