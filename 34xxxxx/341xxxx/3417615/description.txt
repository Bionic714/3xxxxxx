	No levels. No load times. Just never-ending action that doesn't stop 
	until you leave the game! Tony Hawk's American Wasteland gives you - 
	for the first time ever in a Hawk game - the freedom to skate, 
	or bike, throughout a rich, expansive open environment. Once you 
	arrive in Los Angeles, the vast city that gave birth to skate culture, 
	the sky's the limit as you progress through the Wasteland story and 
	choose missions that will have you immersed in the action without 
	ever skating the same line twice!
