Description: Hans Richter and Jean Cocteau draw deep in the surrealist and dadaist tradition and direct a bizzare chess match that is divided in 8 parts with each part depicting a series of acted chess moves. Laden with symbols and visually very compelling this is a film that was way ahead of its time. I don't think it has never been properly restored or appreciated and has long been buried in the sands of time. Hans Richter didn't employ any professional actors but instead casted some of the top names in modern art such as Jean Arp, Alexander Calder, Yves Tanguy and Max Ernst among others.

This is a medium quality VHS rip with the annoying banding on the bottom of the screen but it is definitely watchable. I think that the proper film should have a running time of 80 minutes but this rip is only 70 minutes long so it may have also been edited. Whatever the case this is a rare gem and one of the most fascinating things I have seen lately. If anyone has a better copy of this one give a yell.
