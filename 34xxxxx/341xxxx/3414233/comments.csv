,RoggleToggle,2007-06-15T05:09Z,how do you convert the format as opposed to just using a winamp plugin? ive been searching for an hour to find one and it doesnt seem to exist
,RoggleToggle,2007-06-15T05:44Z,"i cant even figure out how to use the plugin, why cant people just use normal extentions? this is a pain in the ass"

,spunkster,2011-11-28T00:31Z,"Goddammit, why do we all have to convert this stupid, nonstandard format because zenekk refuses to use mp3s? It's like getting your favorite book as a gift... in Chinese. What you're really getting is a chore. Gee, thanks for the extra work."
