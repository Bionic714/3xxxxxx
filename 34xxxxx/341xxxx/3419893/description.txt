Some Native Instruments Absynth 3 .glo file presets I've come across.

A few of these share the same filenames from the factory default sound libraries, but they contain different presets. I was just too lazy to consolidate the banks. Found most of these on random sites and download packs.  Used in Absynth 3, although I imagine they'll work for other versions.
