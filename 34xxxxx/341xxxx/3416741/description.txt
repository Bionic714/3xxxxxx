I'm Going to Tell You a Secret chronicles Madonna's acclaimed 2004
Re-Invention tour and includes behind-the-scenes tour footage and
live concert highlights.

It's an intimate, behind-the-scenes portrait of Madonna as she travels
and performs on her spectacular Re-Invention tour.

Twelve years after Truth or Dare, Madonna has grown and transformed
as a person and an artist.

The scintillation of the entertainment world serves as a counterpoint to her
concern for the future of the world around her.

Madonna continues the provocation only this time her intent is not to shock,
but to inspire.
