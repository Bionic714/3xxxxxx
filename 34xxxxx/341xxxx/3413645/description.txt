Brainwashing 101 is a provocative short documentary (46 minutes) showing how university faculty and administrators use tools such as "speech codes" to force their political views upon students. In this cutting expos√©, documentary filmmakers Maloney, Browning and Greenberg shine a light on political correctness, academic bias, student censorship--even administrative cover-ups of death threats--at three schools: Bucknell University, the University of Tennessee at Knoxville and California Polytechnic State University (Cal Poly).
