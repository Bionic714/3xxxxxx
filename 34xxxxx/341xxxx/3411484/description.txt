Not much to say...EuroEmu.net usually provides the best full sets 
of any ROMs we'd want for our XBox emulators...but for some reason 
they've never touched the Neo Geo Pocket ROMs.  Well I hunted them 
all down and verified them with GoodNGPx 2.01, then 7zipped them 
down from 400 MB to 40.  Remember to check out EuroEmu.net for more 
full sets from every system imaginable.
