It does allow you to update. Just download the file from the website, and use the serial."
,yroy,2006-03-09T01:24Z,"I would like to know why your version number is 1.0.0.1.
The real version should be something like 0509 as mentioned on their fspassengers web site. But i think you have a good one also. So what is the difference instead of the Meg size.  "

,tik68,2006-04-20T07:11Z,Goddam people dont rip off fsp! Fsp is not apart if a BIG company its just a guy named dan and his buddys that spent 1 YEAR making this program. i am ashamed!
,titiro250,2006-04-25T00:23Z,"Hello I'm Dan the author of FsPassengers, not a big company, just an individual that worked 14 month 10-12 hours per day with passion to make this program. As I'm jobless since a long time FsP is my only income for me and familly.

I thought to make this friendly protection because as customer I was pissed by complicated protection scheme and I counted on people honnesty as I'm not a big company that people accuse to be unfair to justify stealing.
I accepted the deal that some would still steal my work, I thought this number would be acceptable as most people are honnest.

But last review of some statistic showed me that at least only 1 user on 26 have bought FsP and thought that my work deserved some rewards. (this doesn't take in account p2p but only download numbers on site as yours vs purchase number)

As I can't live from fresh air if this continue there will probably never be another version of FsPassengers.

Not a menace just fact: When cash is over and if only a few pay you can't continue to work for almost free.

I personnaly think that one can't yell after big company and regret this more and more secure
world and never pay independants authors and alternate solution.

If you consider I have done a good work and an enjoyable software, please consider rewarding my work.
