The reason for the metal is that Necro and his brother Ill Bill were brought up on metal, they actually had a death metal band in the late 80's early 90's and they opened up for the likes of Iron Maiden and Slayer."
,Blodhosta,2009-12-11T22:08Z,"Stypex: Yeah, I know. My record collection is probably like two thirds metal (black mostly) so it's not that I don't like metal, I just think it sounds bad when you put the two styles together. I don't think the rythm of hip hop fits the metal sound at all, and puting rap on a metal-sounding track just comes out weird for me. It's like putting growling vocals on a pop song. It just doesn't mix... But maybe it's just me. :p"
