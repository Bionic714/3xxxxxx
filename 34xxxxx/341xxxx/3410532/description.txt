DER GOLEM (1920) dir. Carl Boese & Paul Wegener

review from IMDB:
"The Golem" is the perfect companion piece for "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari." 
Both are excellent examples of German expressionism.
Pay attention to the surrealist sets and lighting.
This is skilled film-making, and today's directors can well learn from 
classics such as these.
However, do not confuse this with an earlier film of the same title. That 
earlier film is considered lost.
