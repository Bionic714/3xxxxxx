                               About The Band
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Geggy Tah is one of those 'once in a life time' occurances, kinda like when 
Donald Fagen first met Walter Becker and the two decided to cut an LP of music 
that they themselves would listen to. And the similarities don't stop there...

Talking Heads frontman, iconoclast and owner of the eclectic Luaka Bop record
label David Byrne even seems to be at a loss when trying to define what made
Geggy Tah so intriguing during an all too brief heyday, stating simply it's
"like nothing you've ever heard before."

So what was it about the music Greg Kurstin and Tommy Jordan were making back
in the mid-nineties that so amazed one of the most unique voices in modern
music? Was it the cacaphony of diverse influence struggling to keep one step
ahead of Geggy Tah once they got going - or was it the heart rending honesty
and world weary optimisim that made Geggy Tah such the conundrum?

Like Byrne said, Geggy Tah is indeed unlike anything you've ever heard before
but there's a catch - flowing within this stream of novel sound there lies a
wealth of familiar warmth, insider nods and interpritive exploration of our
collective musical history, all coming from a very left of center base.
