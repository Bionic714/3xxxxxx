,CDel921,2007-08-26T22:51Z,"There's been a lot of problems with crap speed and seeding, so I'll be hosting this package in a WinRAR self-extracting archive (.exe) on my own server.  You can download it from http://reoreunion.com/eoc.exe, you should be getting good bandwidth, if you have any problems, email me at eoc@reoreunion.com.  Enjoy, and help keep this awesome game alive."
