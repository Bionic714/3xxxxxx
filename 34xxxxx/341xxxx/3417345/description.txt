This is the theme from the TV series "The Boondocks" on Fox.
Probably ripped from the TV/computer, so soundquality although OK, is not excellent. It's not crap either. :)

It is a really kick-ass beat, lyrics as well. Hope you enjoy! ;)

boondocks [theme lyrics]

i am the stone that the builder refused
i am the visual
the inspiration
that made lady sings the blues
 
i'm the spark that makes your idea bright
the same spark
that lights the dark
so that you can know your left from your right
 
i am the ballot in your box
the bullet in the gun
that inner glow
that lets you know
to call your brother son
 
the story that just begun
the promise of what's to come
and imma remain a soldier
til' the war is won [won]
 
 chop chop chop
judo flip. chop chop chop
judo flip. chop chop chop
judo flip. chop chop chop
