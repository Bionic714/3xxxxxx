,doggywuff,2010-02-28T09:03Z,"this may have a trojan but even if i does download a thing called sandbox

it allowss you to run stuff in a box so it cant get to any of our personal or necessary files
but keygen works"
,Darksocks,2010-03-17T14:53Z,"Wow =)  This works grate Thank you (muner)

Took 50 seconds to download :D ill seed for a few days-months"
,HackerResidence,2010-09-18T00:33Z,It is not a TROJAN and is 100% fully working I promise
,NekoObito,2010-09-20T02:53Z,WARNING THIS CONTAINS A VIRUS. PICKED UP AND REMOVED BY AVG
,kart2009,2010-10-31T14:42Z,Works great ! 
,Leiana,2010-11-07T16:28Z,No viruses detected by Avast. Keygen works perfectly. Thanks :)
,ironfootx2,2011-01-26T06:52Z,"All of the users saying that there is no virus are likely the uploader on different accounts.

This file does contain a trojan horse.  Do not download it."
,Seb1337,2011-02-01T21:54Z,"Stop talking bullshit people, I just downloaded this torrent and it worked perfectly,

AVG is reporting it as a trojan because it's a retarded program.

AVG usually reports ALL .exe's you download as trojans, because they're retarded.

Now piss off and I'll say it again

THIS TORRENT IS SAFE AND USEABLE.

,MrEncrypted,2011-02-14T19:36Z,"It reads as a virus, But it works fine. If your that paranoid about getting a little virus then download sandboxie and run it from there. 

Just used the keygen not 5 minutes ago! Works great!

Thanks for up muner"
,chrismaybury,2011-03-01T14:13Z,Works fine! No Trojan

,DaBomb3rZz,2011-04-25T13:14Z,Why the fuck is people saying its a trojan. Get a proper virus guard. A virus guard isnt a free shitty AVG piece of shit get Kaperesky or Norton or Vipre. If you're worried about trojan get Sandbox
,b1tch..,2011-12-16T16:44Z,no virus>>>>>works
