The only release by the rather obscure norwegian reggae band "Rastafarouts."
With members from one of the best known unknown bands of the norwegian punk scene, Bøyen Beng, these guys & gals got together mostly for the fun of it, and between 1999 and 2001 recorded the 13 tracks of this album. With catchy reggae rythms(I myself hate reggae, but this is.. irresistable. Must... dance..), some norwegian, some english lyrics, and covers of Bøyen Beng(Hoga Hei) and the least known unknown artist of Norway, Per Bergersen(Ridder Sjanseløs), this band has got all you could ever want and more.
