The truly venerable F-4 Phantom is one of the most prolific jet aircraft of the 20th century.  A total of 5,195 of the type were built, 127 by Mitsubishi, when production completely ceased in 1979.  The prototype was first flown on May 27, 1958 and held great promise in a variety of roles.  The aircraft was so appealing that the USAF signed up for the type as well.  Phantoms set many world records during their prime, and many remain in service throughout the world.
