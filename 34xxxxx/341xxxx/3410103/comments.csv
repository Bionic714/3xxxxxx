,cfs525,2006-02-18T05:23Z,"If you can't get it to a disk, it's probably because the file is so large, you might just need a disk with more space"

,ShadowRider540,2008-03-30T08:42Z,"First of all, do any of you people having trouble with this even have a modded Xbox? If not, that would probably be a pretty good start.

I've downloaded just about every RLT Xbox game I can find and all of them have worked perfectly. Fire up Alcohol 120%, choose write image, pick the slowest speed possible, burn, and play. 

FTW.
