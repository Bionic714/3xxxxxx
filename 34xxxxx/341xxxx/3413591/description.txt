A jew in Italy during a time of war and suffering. He uses his sense of humor and love to life to save his only son by convincing him that reality was a game to play hard to win. He played the game with life and his son. 

In the midst of all our fears and worries, comes this movie to convey a message: "Life is life. Life is a game. Life is beautiful. Love, live, smile & sacrifice. And you don't have to let people know. You owe it to yourself and to life to keep it beautiful"

I recommend this movie to every depressed person, and drama lovers.
