Dylan Thomas' "Under Milk Wood" in MP3 format. 

This is the original 1954 BBC version (the best in my humble opinion) with Richard Burton and Richard Bebb as the First and Second Voice. In 46 seperate files, queue them up in your favourite music player, or copy the entire thing onto a disc for a true and wonderful experience.

Quote: 
The afternoon buzzes like lazy bees, round the flowers, round May Rose Cottage. Nearly asleep in a field of nannygoats who hum and gently butt the sun, she blows love on a puffball..."He loves me" (puffs) "he loves me not" (puffs) "he loves me" (puffs) "he loves me not" (puffs). "He loves me! The dirty old fool." Lazy, she lies alone in clover and sweet grass. 17 and never been sweet in the grass ho ho!

Hope you enjoy!







**p.s - this is not an "Audio Book" as such, neither is it "Music", and Dylan would be turning over in his drunken grave if I put it in "Other" or "Sound Clips", so I chose the lesser of those four evils for a category. I hope the eternally anal amongst you will forgive me**
