You can not find this DVD on Amazon or anywhere outside Macedonia or Serbia. Luckily for you I brought it home from Macedonia and others as well that will be released as soon I can find time. 

I will seed for two weeks from now. 

It is an iso made with CloneDVD2. The reason I have not put in rar is to make sure nobody has problems with unraring it. 

Be patient when downloading have slow upload speed!

Enjoy all you out there and remember we are not Greeks, Bulgarian or Albanians we are MACEDONIANS!

Napred Makedonija!
