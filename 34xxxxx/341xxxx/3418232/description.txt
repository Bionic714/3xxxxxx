Some more TXDM to assault your senses! Vomitus is the solo project from the lead vokillist of Mangled Meat. The recording on this one is kinda shitty (too much high end, not enough low end), but that doesn't take too much away from the affect. This is some pretty brutal death grind in the vein of Fuck...I'm Dead and the like. Enjoy!
