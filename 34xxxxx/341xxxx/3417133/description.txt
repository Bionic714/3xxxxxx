Live Video of Velvet Revolver performing Pink Floyd's "Wish You Were Here) at the Alladdin Casino on August 20, 2005.

It is a VERY amazing version of the song.  

Slash's intro is particularly moving.  If it doesn't bring a tear to your eye, you have no soul :-)

The video is a but shaky in spots, but this is a classic performance.

Enjoy!
