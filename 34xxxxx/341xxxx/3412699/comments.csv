,vibesman,2006-02-11T03:31Z,"Hey hey Kiddies!

To use this game on a mac,
1-get ""toast titanium"" for osx
2-open toast
3-go to utilities and select ""mount disk image""
4-choose the jedi knight 2.dmg file
5-you should now see the ""cd"" in finder
6-open the game as you would from your hard drive in apps or games.
6-enjoy!

,artemist,2008-02-17T02:08Z,"Excuse me. When i launch ""Jedi Knight II"" it gives me this weird crackling sound and then closes. what's wrong? i tried mounting with toast and the same thing appears. "
,Dwarming,2008-03-23T16:17Z,"For some reason i cant open the game, i have no idea what the problem could be. 
i have mounted an image, draged the game to my harddisk. But when i try to open the game, my macbook just freezes for a bout 30 sec, and then an error-message pops up.

can any1 tell me how to deal with this problem, please?"
,retinaa,2008-04-16T17:37Z,guys seed please!! there is just one seed.... please guys seed as much as you can.
,aljandro,2008-04-28T23:31Z,just burn it... Running great on Leo...
,foxo512,2008-05-03T06:13Z,"Yep, there must be something incompatible with a MacBook because it doesn't run on mine either. Burned the CD with Toast. Ran the game app on the hard drive with the CD mounted - app begins to load and then stops with annoying audio ""quickly beeping"" until I force-quit."
,VileCore,2008-05-09T11:57Z,"Yeah, um...why do so many people have macs if they don't know jack shit about them? How can you not know what to do? Below ""download this torrent"" is a message: Burn Image on CD to be able to play it.
Kids are so fucking dense."
,VileCore,2008-05-09T11:57Z,"...and so am I, it would seem. Never mind. :P"
,isgirith,2008-05-24T17:06Z,does it work on pc. not just mac.
,VileCore,2008-06-17T14:47Z,"No, it's not going to work on the P(iece of shit) C(omputer). 
You need a Mac. 
If you want the PC version, I suggest you go to the PC section. 
Just a thought."
,stenushka,2008-09-19T19:50Z,The sound is absent...
,notchris,2008-10-14T14:11Z,"First Of All you DON'T NEED TOAST
download file jediknight2.dmg 
double click file and file will mount to desktop as  an icon like a USB Jump Drive
goto finder search disk utility and open
you should see the .dmg file on the left
highlight the .dmg file insert blank cd-r click burn...afterwards
you will be given an option to eject or mount click mount.
now once you see the CD Icon mounted on your desktop you can eject the USB Drive Icon you mounted and delete the original .dmg file you no longer need either. you can skip this step but waste mem and space to do so.

open the cd icon on desk top
you should see something saying drag to hard drive to play go ahead and drag and drop where ever you want
play the game

-HackAMacAttack

don't have the .dmg file
use limewire search mac games





"
,notchris,2008-10-14T14:18Z,"Hey VileCore just because you don't know shit about computers doesn't give you the right to dis PC,  Mac and PC each have there pro and cons
I'll give you a list if your too stupid to figure it what the difference is
for example mac is linux based which means when you put  a scratched cd in it and itunes can't read it your machine freezes this happens because mac is not sophisticated enough to compensate for the scratched areas however a pc is. so shut your mouth and get educated before you keep dissing shit"
,otrovega,2008-11-03T03:57Z,i got the same problem as foxo512....shite!!!
