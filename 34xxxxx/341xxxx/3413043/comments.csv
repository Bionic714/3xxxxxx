nickyandphil: The Open for Business expansion pack was released AFTER the University pack was. You'll need to use Open for Business exe to get into the game. then once in the game, there should be an icon to click on to install a University to any of the towns in the game. There may even be an updated version of the game that needs to be put in. When I uploaded this in 2005 it worked fine. Wish I could be of more help, but without actually seeing your screen to know whats going on I can't do much more.
