P.S. This really is the best filtering software out there -- it has such a small footprint, and
they keep adding new features.  I wish more people knew about it.  I end up putting it on almost every computer
my friends and family ask me to fix because it prevents spyware so well and doesn't bog down the
system like many other filters.  It's very small and works fast (the more you browse, the faster it gets).  Check it out!

Enjoy!!!
