
Montauk and Time 

In a rebroadcast from May 27, 1994, Art Bell conversed with electrical engineer Preston Nichols about the Philadelphia Experiment and the Montauk Project. According to Nichols, Tesla had input on the Philadelphia Experiment and Al Bielek's account of what happened on the ship in 1943 is essentially accurate.

Nichols explained that the work begun with the Philadelphia Experiment was subsequently transferred to Los Alamos Laboratory for the engineering and Brookhaven for the human elements. He said he was brought on board to work for the Montauk Project at a deserted military base in Montauk (not far from Brookhaven's location).

Techniques for mind control at a distance were being developed there using radio waves, he stated. Essentially, they were creating a "mind amplifier" in which sensors picked up a person's "holographic thought pattern," which was then processed through a computer and sent out by radar transmition. Nichols, who said he worked on the radar aspect of the operation, claimed that through such processes they were actually able to create an object out of the "background ether."
