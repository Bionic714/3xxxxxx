,Smoka,2006-01-17T18:35Z,"If you dont know that these games ONLY WORK ON 1.0 or 1.5, then you have some reading to do. such as psp hacks. If you have a version 2.1 your shit outta luck, BUT if you have version 2.0 you can downgrade to 1.5, look up ""2.0 to 1.5 downgrade"" on google. WITHOUT the quotes, duh."
