,bikerbish,2008-05-08T15:35Z,"Oh yeah, this release ain't SP3 ... You will have to get that via windows update.

OTHERWISE GOOD STUFF"
,bikerbish,2008-05-08T16:05Z,"SORRY, SP3 IS IN UPDATE FOLDER AFTER YOU'VE MADE YOUR CD.

You will need .. ""Anti-MSOPA.exe"" from

http://files.filefront.com/Anti+MSOPAexe/;4232656;/fileinfo.html

In order to bypass activation shit.

Don't try to use ""Office Update"", get all updates via ""Windows Update"" site.

I think that's about it, hope this helps."

,bikerbish,2008-05-10T14:53Z,"I never got asked for no password, I just ""right clicked"" on file No1, used ""Extract Here"" using WinRar ... that was it"
,bombertonforty,2008-07-24T02:42Z,"Working fine here
