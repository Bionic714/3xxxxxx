The Wailers, featuring the legendary Bob Marley, Peter Tosh and Bunny Wailer, became the most influential band in the history of reggae music. "Catch a Fire," their first Island album, released in 1973, introduced them to an international rock audience. Here the principal figures in the creation of "Catch a Fire" tell the story of how this record was designed to "cross over." The program features an interview and performance by Bunny Wailer, rare archival interviews with Marley and Tosh, and contributions from many of those who performed on the record. Featuring home movies of the Wailers in Jamaica, previously unseen footage, and unique performances of many album tracks such as "Stir It Up," "Stop That Train" and "Kinky Reggae," this is a documentary that will endlessly fascinate the viewer.
