,willemvo,2006-04-27T17:39Z,"I can't figure it out, when I extract I get 5 folders and all contain files named for windows, but they should be for Symbian. (I don't have a card reader)
I have tried to rename them, but I don't know how many I have to rename. 
Is there any way I can get this done.

Thanks a lot,

,haylands,2007-05-20T20:43Z,"The root of the memory card is the page that opens when you first look at it, stick the card in the reader, click on its icon under my computer and the box that opens with the folders in is the root of the memory card, you have to copy the files to this location. it is best to format the card in the phone first to set it up, you may find when you copy the files it copies one called the same as one already in the card after formatting, it will ask you if you want to overwrite it, click yes and away you go. As with all things it is best to back up the phone first so that if anything goes wrong you can start again."
,grefven,2007-07-27T15:26Z,God damnit! HOW to start the program when put on the memory card? :)

,soltes,2008-02-22T01:39Z,hi ..where can i get the maps? installed ok..but asking me for maps
,soltes,2008-02-23T11:43Z,By the way one of the folders 'Raster' is empty. Shouldn't there be maps in it? I feel it is not full something is missing. Can you tell what the solution is?
