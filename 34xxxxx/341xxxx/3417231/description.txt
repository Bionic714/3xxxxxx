I've been downloading Chrisgoes's superb torrents for nearly a year now, and thanks to all the great garage tracks he has supplied I have put together a few garage mixes. I have made the mix using mixmeister pro,and although 85% happy with it would like to tweak it more.If anyone could recommend another mixing program, please advise.

 If people would like the individual tacks i may upload, but do not want to step on Chrisgoes territory.

This mix (along with others) were designed as a DJ set for The Skull club venue, tamworth, England. (next one due to take place 18th Jan 2006)

What has took me so long is that I supplied a vJ set - this music forms a background to it. 

The VJ set splits this mix into 2 avi files. The video samples include, club scene from coogans bluff, pink floyd in london, how to roll a joint, pink flamingoes, barbarella, batman 1966, blow up, vampyros lesbos, get carter, the prisoner, tHe trip and Psych out. This i am particulay proud of,and again thanks to all the dowloads from Pirate bay.

If people are interested in the avi files let me know so i can upload

I am busy creating another vj set and more mixes for next skull club. 
If anyone has any psych dvds they could recommend(plus links) or tunes let  me know, and i will try to put in.
 
Also is anyone out there looking to set up an online radio station which may include tunes such as above, or are you hosting a psychedelic night where a couple of the skull club dj's could do a set for you please advise.  

Any comments appriciated..Long live chrisgoes.
