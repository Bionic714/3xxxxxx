Pun intended:
Hey reader,  you see that play on words I just made? Yeah, well that wasn't an accident. In 
fact, I thought it was so clever that I didn't think your simple mind would be able to 
comprehend the brilliance of my play on words, and I wanted to make sure you know that I'm 
not only smart enough to use homonyms, but that I'm smart enough to point them out.
No pun intended:
Please direct your attention towards my pun. Admittedly I do think it's clever, but I think 
that you think so highly of me, that I want you to know that I would never resort to using 
such a commonplace literary device in my prose. Therefore, I would like to formally renounce 
my attempt at humor and assure you that I am above making puns as a writer, as a pupil of 
language, and as citizen of Earth."
