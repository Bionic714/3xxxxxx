Description: Willard Fillmore (Norm MacDonald), the abused and under-appreciated chauffeur to Miss Crock (Elaine Stritch), the employer from hell, has devised a foolproof plan for revenge. Along with his hot-headed best friend Rusty P.Hayes (Dave Chappelle), he will kidnap the woman's prized pooch, holding it ransom. But when the dog escapes Miss Crock mistakenly comes to the conclusion thats it's her chauffeur who has been kidnapped. The guys try to cover their tracks by employing the creepy mortician Grover Cleaver (Danny DeVito), but he only triples their problems. The confusion escalates out of control, resulting in a hilarious comedy of error and a bungled crime which is SCREWED!
Tagline: Everyone gets it in the end.
