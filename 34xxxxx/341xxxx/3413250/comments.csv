,SuperMole,2006-02-04T23:28Z,"The setup of the Bonus DVD crashes, error 6001... Beats me.
Does anyone have a good install with the DVD setup? I managed to install some parts of the dvd thru independed setups.
But i want to know what is in the 2Gb+ cab file of the DVD. Cant open it. :(
Help help!"
,SuperMole,2006-02-05T00:12Z,"Guess what... When i run the DVD in my laptop, the setup works normally.
This laptop doesnt have Pinnacle installed, and never has before. Maybe it is a registry problem?"
,born2win,2006-02-07T02:42Z,You can solve the DVD error -6001 by deleting or renaming the folder C:Program FilesCommon FilesInstallShieldProfessionalRunTime 700 and reinstall the DVD Bonus CD.
,born2win,2006-02-07T02:46Z,"This InstallShield error indicates a corrupt verison of InstallShield is installed on your computer. To correct this issue, simply delete the following folder from your computer and attempt to run the installer again:

 C:Program FilesCommon FilesInstallShieldProfessionalRunTime 701 

If this fails to correct the problem, we recommend you RENAME (not delete) the entire  C:Program FilesCommon FilesInstallShield folder and try again. You may rename the folder to anything you like, but we recommend something similar to 'InstallShield-old'."

,Synkedam,2006-02-12T14:45Z,"NOTICE! 

This is a good torrent but a bad program.
I have this by my own and I want to warn you before you dl this.

Pinnacle studio takes A LOT of memory when using it and crashes EVEN IF you have a good computer. This program is very slow and takes a lot of patience to learn. I don't recommend this program for those who have not-so-fast-computer and less than 1gb ram.  

Also, if you want all the Hollywood FX visualization, sounds, music, filters etc., you have to pay for those because I don't think that you can find them from internet yet. "
,radius,2006-02-12T22:07Z,i have the hollywood sound and all of it on my old pinnacle and it works fine for my but i am downloading this (pinnacle studio 10) do i need to download this bonus dvd i did just download cd.1 and cd.2 is that allright?
,jjsasha,2006-02-14T06:45Z,JUST DOWNLOAD CD 1 AND 2 . THE GO TO SEEDLER OR ISO HUNT AND FIND JUST THE DVD. IF YOUR USING AZEREUS YOU CAN CHOOSE ONLY THE FILES YOU WANT TO DOWNLOAD. AFTER INSTALLING CD 1 AND 2 IT WILL ASK YOU TO INSERT DISK 3 [BONUS DVD] . YOU DONT HAVE TO IF YOU DONT HAVE IT. HENCE 'BONUS'.

,andy5190,2006-05-17T02:02Z,"Born2win is correct, by renaming:

C:Program FilesCommon FilesInstallShieldProfessionalRunTime

you can install the Bonus DVD (this is the fix)."
,annorlunda45,2006-08-17T01:31Z,"LUL: Well, if you use Daemon Tools you just unmount the first iso (Pinnacle Studio Plus 10 CD1.iso) at that point and mount Pinnacle Studio Plus 10 CD2.iso instead.
"
,annorlunda45,2006-08-17T02:06Z,As mentioned before you might need patch 10.1.2 if the app crashes on startup. If you dont want to register at Pinnacle it can be found here http://thepiratebay.org/details.php?id=3513168
