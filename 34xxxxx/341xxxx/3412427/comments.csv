""Excellent course to learn FRENCH from 0. It has 4 levels of learning and development.""

I haven't finished downloading it, but I'll write back with my review. I hear it's a lot better than the Rosetta Stone series."
,rainbowfied,2008-07-02T00:18Z,"Well, is it any good?
Waiting for that review."
,idkwut2puthere,2009-06-07T15:36Z,"Can someone PLEASE write down a step by step on how to install this properly on a comp with Windows XP? 

There are instructionals up the ass for Rosetta Stone. But I did my research and found that Tell Me More is much better. However, still a n00b with computers, there's no way I can install this program the right way without some detailed instruction. 

CAN SOMEONE PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE help me?!"
,idkwut2puthere,2009-06-07T15:40Z,"@robbiethief

I saw you post on another Tell Me More torrent page asking for instructions on how to download. Did you figure it out? because you didn't say anything about needing help here. If you did, indeed, figure out how to properly install could you PLEASE tell me to do it. 

I would be supremely grateful."
,lsuui,2009-09-02T20:28Z,"Ok, after downloading do the following:

1) Download Daemon tools from here http://www.daemon-tools.cc/eng/downloads
and install (I did free trial of Pro)

2) Insert blank CD in your computer

3) Click on Burn Image in Daemon tools and browse ( ... ) for the Tell Me More folder CD1 and the .nrg file inside of it.

4) Burn it to disc.

5) Repeat for each of the 3 other CD folders

6) Put the first disc you burned into your computer and click on Autorun.exe to install.

7) Put in the second CD and you can start using the software.

There is probbaly a way you could run the software directly from your harddrive but I haven't looked into that.

Hope that helps."
