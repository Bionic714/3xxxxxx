If you don't know the story behind this one here it is. This is the video that was on the big screens during the show, so sometimes there are blackouts when the screens weren't meant to have video. This video is just AMAZING, it was the DVD that started the archive and the quality here still amazes me. If you don't have this video yet you are missing out on one of the best videos to EVER exist!
