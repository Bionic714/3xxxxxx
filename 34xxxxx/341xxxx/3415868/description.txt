Live In Bucharest: The Dangerous Tour  1992

After a nearly five-year hiatus, international superstar Michael Jackson followed up the multi-platinum success of BAD with his hardhitting 1991 album DANGEROUS. A gutsy opus of dance-oriented pop, DANGEROUS spawned an ambitious world tour that broke previous attendance records and took Jackson to the newly democratized cities of Eastern-bloc Europe. This highly rated HBO special captures Jackson on the DANGEROUS tour with a complete concert recorded in Bucharest, Romania, on October 1, 1992, blazing through an energetic set that includes dazzling live performances of album hits like "Heal the World" and "Black or White" as well as older classics "Billie Jean," "Beat It," "Man in the Mirror," and more.
