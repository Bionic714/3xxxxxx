,locdog15,2006-11-26T13:36Z,How do you guys get this game to your gamecube? Do you use a chip and hook the GC up to your comp or do you have some special burner for the discs? Got any webbsites that actually provide some info on how to rip a cube?
,masterdrock,2007-02-10T03:10Z,How do I get it to my GC do I burn it on those small discs?
,Szimen,2007-03-21T23:01Z,"EVERYBODY WHO WONDERS HOW TO PLAY DOWNLOADED GAMECUBE GAMES: OPTION 1. Get ""Dolphin"" gamecube emulator at www.dolphin-emu.com/downloads.php AND PLAY WITH A .GCM FILE (ISO=GCM just rename the file if it's an iso file) but this laggs aLOT, because of the custom processor in the GC processes things differently than a computer processor. The 450mHz GC processer doesn't lagg. A P4 4500mHz does. You get max 10 fps, it isn't worth the try.
OPTION 2. Get yourself a modchip, e.g Viper GC Extreme . This needs to be soldered inside your cube, and voids warranty. Also you need to buy mini DVD's and if you don't have one - a REGULAR DVD-RW drive. Burn the downloaded iso to the disc, and follow the modchip instructions. again - .gcm=.iso
To play on emulator rename to .gcm, to burn, rename to .iso"
