,stikmata,2008-09-21T11:50Z,cryptic statement
,nexusprime,2009-04-10T22:47Z,"thanks, but where are the (HDCD) versions of the later albums like this one. the sound quality on your ""please please me"" upload sounds ten times better than the sound quality on this one. that's not right. this album is much better and it deserves that HD sound as well. can you put up HD versions of the later albums please. 

i registered with this site just to tell you that.

thanks anyway "
