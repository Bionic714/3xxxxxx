Pablo Francisco: It's not R'n'B music you know. R'n'B music is always five black guys with no shirt. "Yeah, I'm horny, Yeah." They always singing how fine a girl is. "Girl you're fine. Lay you down fine." They always say smooth soft and silky in every song don't they then they put beats to it. "Girl you're smooth, you're soft, fine... silky"
