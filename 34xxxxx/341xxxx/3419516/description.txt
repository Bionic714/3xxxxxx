This CD features a select compilation of music from the early albums "Ancient Leaves" (1978), "M'ocean" (1984), "Plunge" (1986), "Floating Whispers" (1987), and several previously unpublished tracks. "Ancient Leaves" was recorded in the spring of 1977 and was performed live in August of that year at the "7-7-77" festival in Ocean Park. "Marriage Chords" was performed live entirely on the Serge Synthesizer for my wedding in 1980. "Three Faces of the Goddess" was created for a performance series with dancers, and the pieces from Plunge and Floating Whispers were created in between film projects. Some material has been edited. All have been meticulously digitally re-mastered. A full 74 minutes of music.
