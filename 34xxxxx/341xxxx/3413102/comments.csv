,bamseeee,2007-08-30T15:37Z,Hey! Love this movie but how do I use the .sub file? pretty new at this...
,Rihdan,2009-02-10T04:34Z,"hey, for those of you who didn't get it, you have to unpack the .rar file to get the subtitle files.

this caught me off guard, so i hope my comment helps.

also Echizen, why give us the .rar instead of just giving us the subs? it just makes it look like you have a virus hidden in this torrent.

as far as i know this is clean, but im just saying."
