,Limio,2007-01-09T15:14Z,Hey can we get a seed on this?  I'm stuck at 98.7% and am currently seeding to over 50 people!  If someone could seed for like an hour I could finish this and will take over seeding responsibility for the other people!  COME ON!!! SEED! Someone please!

,jpmittins,2007-09-02T07:26Z,I have a question for the people that posted the first two comments on this page. Did you guys ever get anyone to seed or did you just end up deleting the torrent?
