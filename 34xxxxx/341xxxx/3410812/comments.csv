,al9516,2006-04-28T01:27Z,did anyone find the serial?
,expert01,2006-08-11T19:09Z,"Idiots, try INSTALLING it. If it asks for a serial, then you didn't download mine and you need to post at the location you downloaded it. This does NOT need a serial.

BTW installs fine. Force a hash check in your client if you have problems."
