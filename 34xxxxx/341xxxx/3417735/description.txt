Full Album @ 320kbps


Rachael Lampa has done an amazing thing on this eponymous release. She chose to take chances and calculated risks, and it paid off in spades. Lyrically, it is everything that a Christian album should be - firmly grounded in Truth but not afraid to deal with the human condition in an honest way. Rachael Lampa is bold, confident, and mature - the best Christian pop album in years. Lampa has just moved to the front of her class to become the foremost female voice in Christian music. The only question that now remains is whether the mainstream music scene will also be daring enough to take notice. From the opening crack of the drum you can immediately tell that this is not the Rachael Lampa of 2002. That point is re-enforced by the album's opening line: "It's taken me all this time to see..." The sweeping theme of Rachael Lampa's newest album is change and growth and so it is fitting, then, that it is a self-titled project.
