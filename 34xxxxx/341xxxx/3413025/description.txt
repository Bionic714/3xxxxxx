Starship Troopers, Strangelite's splendid FPS based on Paul Verhoeven's classic 1997 sci-fi satire has just received a quick demo blessing in the form of Plasma Mountain, a new 15 minute timed demo which lets you sample some of the game's intense bug blasting action.

It's a tense situation on Plasma Mountain with smaller blasma bugs on the ground attacking your fleet and taking out Earth's airborne cruisers. Federation pilots have failed to dislodge the main plasma beastie and it's down to you to reinforce the first wave of troopers who are already on the ground. You've got one giant search and destroy mission ahead of you, so assault to the summit and get medieval on that plasma bug's mandibles. The fleet's future is in your hand, Marauder!
