,wetfitvagina,2006-01-05T02:21Z,"If there was still someone who cannot use ""Xeidog69"" 's the latest trainer , you 'Xeidog69' should run and test on more system environment. An example is to test on other OS (Windows98,98SE,Me,2000,XPPro,XPHome,XPMediaC) , other graphic cards (ATi,nVidia,Matrox)"
,wetfitvagina,2006-01-05T02:24Z,"{2} , other CPUs and their own systems (Pentium4,AthlonXP,CeleronD,Sempron,Athlon64,Centrino,Turion64) , other partitions , between Notebook PC and Desktop PC"
,wetfitvagina,2006-01-05T02:25Z,"{3} , and other ways that you can spend. Your friends may have different components of their computer and you can test. This comment may be too basic or too easy but I have intended to say because you had said ""...this trainer like the past ones is now working for me 100%..."" and POP-T2T usually consumes various addresses of memory for the prince 's variables."
,wetfitvagina,2006-01-05T02:29Z,"{4} When I replaced ""Energy nVidia FX5500 128 MB"" with ""PowerColor ATi Radeon 9600 Pro 256 MB"" , I found that the trainer +4 (your version-2 trainer) cause a bug during playing POP-T2T."
,wetfitvagina,2006-01-05T02:30Z,"{5} The bug is that the prince will turn his body back if I stop his walking.

I strongly wish you would finish a complete version of ""Prince of Persia - The Two Thrones"" and there would be someone who can create a perfect crack to copy the installer of ""Prince of Persia - The Two Thrones"" which would be used without powering-off CD,DVD Drive."
