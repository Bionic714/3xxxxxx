Release Notes:
* Fixed problems from previous releases( versions 1 and 2 and 3)
I have made another new trainer..for those of you who the old  trainers didnt work maybe this one will..this time around I tried to figure out how it wouldnt work for others..I  may have found out why while making this trainer I had uninstalled the game from my d:drive which was my second hard drive. and then I installed the game to drive c. after doing so I found 10 more new addresses for the health and sand tanks..I repeated the process of uninstalling and reinstalling the game between drives c: and  d: and found no more missing addresses for the health and sand tanks..
this trainer like the past ones is now working for me 100%..only now I get an occasional game crash,not often and when it does happen its usually when i go to exit to the menu..maybe there is too much code thats causes it on occasion..but Hopefully this one works for you now..and its not a lock up crash the game just exits completely is all..and like I said it doesnt happen too ofton for me..Give it a try and I hope it works for ya..ENJOY AND HAPPY GAMING....
