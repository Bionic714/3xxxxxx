This is Ringo Starr Live & Peter Frampton Live from 1998 Hard Rock.

Peter Frampton is great and one of the most over looked guitarist of our time!! I can never say anything bad about a BEATLE and Ringo puts on a Great Show also.

I will send some more Roy Buchanan up Later thanks, Rick from Roys HUB
