,Phunda_Mental,2007-09-10T23:24Z,If the file is too big for you - DON'T d/l it - but for cryin' out loud - stfu about it - be thankful it's here at all
,walk_through_walls,2007-12-07T15:36Z,Can anybody confirm whether or not this version is universal binary?
,jonandk,2008-02-09T18:45Z,SN is not working. Does anyone have one that does?
,BurnerReggae,2008-03-26T03:44Z,"My download is complete but when I try to open the .dmg file it get a message that says there are 'no mountable file systems'. Is there something I must do with Toast?
Cheers. "
,jlroettger,2008-04-01T22:17Z,"note: even though it (surprisingly) will install and open fine on an intel mac, THIS IS NOT A UNIVERSAL BINARY!!! it's powerpc...."
,angelo347,2008-04-30T17:48Z,"could anyone finish this up...we are like tons of guy waiting at 99,9"
,poestom,2008-05-05T20:09Z,"Please seed, I am waiting mow for two weeks..... where is the last 0,74 %......?"
,KatAppleMac,2008-06-23T15:04Z,im just wonderin how to be a seeder or leecher... im just new here... hehe.. anyone??????????????
,Hot Rodny,2008-08-08T03:43Z,"Waited a month now...at 90%...
I hope it works when it completes.
I will not get surprised if it don't.
But hey, i am not complaining. I get stuff for free here.  :)
But i think what people ARE complaining about is the lack of accuracy when people put packages together, and people uses hours, days, weeks and even months downloading just to discover that it doesn't work because of someone's clumsiness. I think it is allowed to open one's mouth and express one's frustration at that point."
,justorrentz,2008-09-28T01:12Z,"the dvd application is greyed out when I try and install the software, any ideas?"
,macman27,2008-10-20T01:50Z,How do you seed?
,strike_out,2008-10-20T11:11Z,Can anyone seed please! I'm stuck on 99.9%!!! 
,james207,2008-11-24T00:50Z,"hi all,

cant get any serials to work for me...and new ones? ideas? thanks"
,michaelrwatson,2008-12-06T03:23Z,"6 GB ?!!? What's wrong with you?? NOTHING should be that big. Maybe i should say, what's wrong with Apple. I have DVD Studio Pro 1.5 and it's a grand total of 12 MB, so this file is *500 times* as big. It can't possibly do 500 times as much--i'm sure it doesn't even do twice as much! V1.5 works great, so i'll just keep using that. Thanks."
,bodyrock666,2009-02-24T10:27Z,could someone just post the templates separately?
,balahir,2009-07-25T18:20Z,works fine on an intel mac. the correct serial is posted by gla and emarkay.
,3ss0neR,2009-12-21T17:15Z,"FYI: The Final Cut Studio suite is 50GB total: 4GB for the applications themselves, Final Cut Pro, Color, DVD Studio Pro, Soundtrack Pro, Motion, Cinema Tools, Compressor and Apple Qmaster, then 46GB for the optional/templates content:
9GB for DVD Studio Pro, 7GB for Motion templates, 22GB for audio content,  and 8GB for LiveFonts.  
So 6.94GB, compressed, is absolutely normal for this file.  
Please seed so that more people can have complete files.  Thanks."
,Jikax,2010-04-06T17:48Z,"don't know how to use toast?

on my pc:
i renamed it to .img
mounted it with daemon tools....
created a iso with imgburn
copied the iso to my mac...
voila... now it works..."
,hedkaz,2010-04-19T09:41Z,"I seem to be having a hard time installing/getting this to run. 
After it says it is successfully installed, I cant find the program anywhere...
It's not in my applications folder or anywhere else apparently. 
Please, help me... Thanks."
,jr917,2010-05-25T10:34Z,i was wondering if anyone could help me figure out my problem...i converted the file to .img then mounted it and installed completely then the file wont open once i hit the icon i just get a pop up saying it dvd pro has closed unexpectedly every time is there any way to fix this problem?
,kartingfreak,2010-05-28T00:45Z,download is complete but after I installed it it give me an error saying 'DVD Studio Pro quit unexpectedly' any1 that has a solution for this problem? :/
,Poker,2010-10-12T08:37Z,Crashes for me. INTEL I7
,Poker,2010-10-12T08:40Z,"This is ""before you install""
Minimum Hardware Requirements

,pirata316,2011-07-24T18:45Z,"I've got a MacBook Pro
Running Mac OS X 10.6.8
Procesor 2.4GHz Intel Core 2 Duo
Memory 4GB 1067MHz DDR3
and when I install it says: The installation encountered an error and did not successfully install...
What can I do here?"
,pirata316,2011-07-28T22:16Z,"In the before you install instructions it says for PowerPC.
Now I just figured out that Macs are either PowerPC (older generations) or Intel (Newer generations)
But aren't some programs supposed to work for both? :s
I think the 4.1 version works for intel based macs.
At least thats what the apple site seems to say when you look for this software but for some reason it puts you in final cut x page. Maybe they're similar in their HW requirements... or part of a same package...
Still, I can now install version 4, but it quits unexpectedly so i'm getting version 4.1 now and see what's up."
,pirata316,2011-07-28T22:23Z,"Quoting Drew13 on: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/1872344?start=0&tstart=0

4.1 is Intel version of DVD SP, 4.0.x is not, if you have 4.1.x it will upgrade to the last version in the 4.1.x series. 4.0.x will not upgrade to 4.1.x

I still don't know enough about Macs"
,TeamDCPX,2011-09-06T23:06Z,"For those with the error: ""DVD Studio Pro quit unexpectedly"" 

Try running software update and seeing if you have the most recent ""Pro Applications Update""
This is what fixed it for me.

Just Noting that this is also safe for OSx86 Hackintosh Builds. As i am using one lol. No problems whatsoever. Just make sure to untick any unwanted updates. "
,dinkmtz,2012-03-26T05:14Z,"@TeamDCPX thanks for the advice, but it still didn't work for me."
