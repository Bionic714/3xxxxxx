Album Description
Long before there was The OC, there was The Offspring, formed by a pair of Orange County high school buddies back in '84 following a show in Irvine by local legends Social Distortion. Almost two decades, six albums and 32 million records later, those two pals, vocalist/guitarist Dexter Holland and bassist Greg K, along with fellow classmate (and school custodian) guitarist Noodles, are still delivering. Greatest Hits collects together some of theri most memeorable moments, including "Hit That", "The Kids Aren't Alright" and the massive hit, "Pretty Fly (For A White Guy)".
