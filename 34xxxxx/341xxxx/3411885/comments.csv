Can someone please seed ""Hell Comes to Frogtown""?  I've been stuck at 87.3% for about a week.  I don't even see it listed here anymore."

And I totally agree with the previous poster.. Madison Stone is HOT"
,pstrnutbag44,2008-10-04T22:40Z,"Thanks for this, it's been forever since I got to watch this. Anybody remember the name of a similar type of movie about a bunch of puppets for a kids show that lead shady lives? The rabbitt is a sex-addict that catches VD or something, etc. I think it's from around the same time, I saw it a long time ago on VHS rented from the old Cult CLassics section at the old Hollywood Video. Can anyone at all help me to recall the title or find this movie, please?!?!"

the movie you're thinking of is Meet the Feebles (peter jackson) , the rabbit gets aids, hippo goes on a massacre, frog is a junkie etc..

muppets on crack"
