,arata75,2008-03-27T03:06Z,"thorin222,

most xbox emulators don't really work too well. you'd be better off buring this iso, using a program like PowerISO, then putting it in your real xbox, assuming you have one. u can get one for 40 bux if not."
,royalsolomo,2008-03-30T09:27Z,will this work on a 360 purchased in the US?
,cdextra22,2008-04-24T12:06Z,like others before me i ask if this works on the xbox of 360? ya know XBox360?
,halo24,2008-06-07T04:28Z,It doesn't works.
,halo24,2008-06-08T05:44Z,"That's ok. It works if you burn the iso WITH the .lyt.

Thks! Jet Set is a very good game."
,James.Denholm,2008-07-26T07:37Z,"According to wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_Set_Radio_Future#Xbox_360_backwards_compatibility):
""On 19 April 2007, a backwards compatibility update from Microsoft allowed most users to play the game on the Xbox 360. However, gamers who had the Sega Bundled version (with Sega GT 2002 on the same disc) found that it would not run on the 360. PAL support was also completely lacking.

A fix for JSRF hit Xbox Live on 12 July, 2007, fixing many of the bugs gamers came across since the initial patch. The fix also enabled the owners of the bundled version and all PAL regions to play JSRF on their Xbox 360. However, the bundled PAL version will not work through a VGA cable, as the menu for selecting which game to play only works in 50Hz.""

You can't get this to run on the 360, UNLESS you can con XBox Live into thinking the copy is legit (or something like that, I don't have Live). Now, what I want to know, is if I need a mod chip or whatever for this to run on my origional XBox."

,dinosaurwithahat,2010-09-26T21:36Z,"This game is one of the best games i've ever played!
I have the SEGA bundle disc but unfortunately it's to scratched to work :( really hope this torrent works so that I can play the game again.
Will seed, because no one should be without this game!"
,dinosaurwithahat,2010-10-03T20:07Z,"I've finished downloading and I'm currently seeding.
Just wanted to confirm that the game works on my modded pal xbox. I've also taken the liberty to write a small tutorial on burning the game because there have been some confusion about the .lyt file and so forth.

How to burn and play JSRF:

Before you start you'll need a DVD burning program such as Nero, ImgBurn or PowerISO.
I used ImgBurn because it's very easy, beginner friendly and can be downloaded for free at http://www.imgburn.com/index.php?act=download
(I will write this tutorial as if you're using ImgBurn. If you use another program, some things might be formulated differently and/or located in different places, but the steps are pretty much the same.)

Step 1: Open the burning program

Step 2: Press ""Write image file to disc""
(It's at the top left when you open the program.)

Step3: Select ""Xbox - RLT - Jet Set Radio Future.iso"" from the ""Xbox - RLT - Jet Set Radio Future""-folder, by clicking the little folder with a magnifying glass that is located in the middle, at the top of the screen.

Step 4: Press next to ""Write Speed:"" where it says ""AWS"" and choose 1x.
(This step is not necessary but I suggest you do it)

Step 5: Press the ""Write""-button at the bottom left corner and wait.

Step 6: Take the disc and put it in your xbox and get ready to enjoy one of the best games ever made!

I tried burning with the .lyt file but it didn't work. When I just burned the .iso file to a disc it worked, although I have some occasional lagging and sometimes the music stops. I think this is because I burned the game at max speed and this should therefore not be a problem if you did step 4.

Have an awesome gaming experience!"
