Dylan Thomas - "Return Journey To Swansea"

Recorded by the BBC before "Under Milk Wood", this is a full cast dramatization of Dylan Thomas as he revisits his past in the now war-ravaged town of his youth. 

Starring the great man himself, this is the story of a precociously talented writer as he wanders the streets looking amongst the bombed-out ruins for the ghost of the town which he grew up in. Dramatic reconsturctions represent his interactions with the people he meets on his wanderings.

And, as one critic wrote, "...it's just wonderful. I was left with a strange feeling of nostalgia for a place I never knew, from a time before I was born..." And they are right.

So, another rare serving of Dylan Culture from your humble servant Packbell (see also my torrent for "Under Milk Wood"). In this desert we call the modern world, such offerings are worth their weight in gold so its best to get it while you can. Listen and relax and reminice of a bygone age on what it is to be a R.E.A.L artist. 

Turner prize my arse!

In fact, if I did represent my arse in that moronic competition it probably would win a prize. I mean, if a bed, a garden shed and half a cow can win it...Ye Gods!

Anyway, Enjoy!
