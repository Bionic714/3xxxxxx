[RELOADED] the PSP version of the 1999 movie [Bicentennial Man]
mp4 format, put it into your PSP memory stick's video folder and rename it like M4V1000*.mp4 and watch.
or see it on a PC with a mp4 player like QUicktime 7

Very good movie and should get a better rating if not for the advertising blunder.
This is not a sci-fi comedy. With some laughs but it's serious.
