,IceHappy,2009-03-17T16:11Z,Thank you for the upload....  The reason Larry is soooo goood and funny is that we have all been there at least once in Larry's situation.  I am sometimes sooo embarrassed for Larry it hurts then come the laughter for relief until no longer able to breathe....  Thanks again... Soooo funny:)
