,CPtreo,2008-01-30T23:55Z,Because if you don't then maybe I should dig out my old 4-track master tape and post a fresh mix.
,ezekiel1986,2008-04-17T19:30Z,"Hey mate. You certainly know your metal! Atleast I have every possible reason to think so. Was wondering if you could help me to dig up some Moonsorrow records? That would be a lovely treat!

Thanks for the music, and keep it up. Great work."
