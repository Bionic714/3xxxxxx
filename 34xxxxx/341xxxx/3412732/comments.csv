ICP never made a video for pass me by. i dont know what juggalos you were gonna kid into downloading your piece of shit 10 kb ""video"" of a song that was never made into a video just so the shit could infect there computer with whatever viruses you thought worthy of throwing into this miserable excuse for a juggalo torrent. you get the official juffahoe epic fail award.

to any of my juggalo homies who were fooled into downloading this shit. im sorry homie. i hope your computer forgives you one day for all the shit your naivety put it through."
