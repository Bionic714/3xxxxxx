,~{[K]}~,2006-03-09T03:01Z,it depends you have to find out if the game is DVDrom or CD it says it on the lower back of the games cases
,segin,2006-08-07T02:09Z,"DEFINITVE: What Media is REQUIRED To Copy a PS2 Game.

This is a little tip for those looking to duplicate PS2 discs. If the underside of the disc has a silver-gold color (e.g. looks like a normal CD), it's a DVD. If it has a blue tint (like the black tint of a PSX game), it's a CD. You should also notice a logo depicting the media on the media's label."
,Harmonis,2006-08-26T18:26Z,"Wrong.  On CD TYPE.  The color does not designate if it's a CD or DVD.  

However the file size is the quickest way to to tell. if the any file being burned to the unit is bigger than 700mb then you can be sure that it's a DVD."
