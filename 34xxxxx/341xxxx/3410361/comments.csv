,TM245,2006-02-24T20:11Z,"This is a TM245 News Flash: I now own a Hauppauge WinTV-PVR 150(Media Center Edition) tv tuner. And am now running on XP(MCE) too. From this point on you will never again hear the bad audio channel on my capps. My brother calls it Crickets in the background, lol."
,TM245,2006-02-24T20:12Z,"...continued. Infact, he bought me this new Hauppauge tv tuner he hated the crappy audio so much. See, he works all day every day, so I record the shows he likes to watch, well we both like, and after a hard days work he doesn't wanna come home and watch his favorite show with uhhhh... ""Crickets"" chirping in the background."
