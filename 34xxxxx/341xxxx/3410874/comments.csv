,Maharaja-Krishna,2009-05-19T04:11Z,"For those (probably all now) who are stuck with 71.2% done (3.01GB) try to do this: go to your torrent dl folder and delete all the extension "".!ut"" from the *.vob files.
Then try to watch the movie with the needed audio language and/or subtitle language. If you are lucky it should work. I did not test all thouroughly but what I tested was ok.
First I thought that at least a part of the movie would be missing but apparently not! So just try and see...
And for the others please keep on seeding at least up to the ratio 1.5!!"
,Maharaja-Krishna,2009-05-19T04:16Z,"I just wanted to precise what should be obvious: in order to continue to seed you'll have to rename the files back to ""*.!uit"" so if you have enough disk space I would advise you to just copy the whole content to another directory for renaming and viewing purposes (or burning a DVD of course) so the partial seed may remain active for uploads..."
,Maharaja-Krishna,2009-05-19T04:41Z,"Ok I realised something: when I wrote above ""to continue to seed"" of course in this particular case it's not really seeding since only 100% availability of the file actually can be considered as seed but anyway even non downloading peers will be uploading pieces that they already have so the ratio can also be applied in this special case. Hope it makes sense..."
,Maharaja-Krishna,2009-07-05T07:28Z,"I am sorry to have to report that even with 71.2% of the movie it's too jerky so watch...
So forget what I have written above and unfortunately this torrent is dead so stop loosing your time leeching since no seeder seems willing / able to come back after weeks of waiting time...  :(("

Since you uploaded something yesterday I am glad you are still existing on TPB.  :-)

PLEASE could you seed a little this torrent again, just what is necessary for me to finish the last 29%...

Initial (super) seeding mode would be the best but if you just upload what I need for being a seeder I will take care of reviving the swarm!!

I hope you will read this post!  Cross my fingers...

THANKS!!"
