Basic Slide Presentation is a two-hour slide presentation done at a bookstore in Arcadia, CA in 1990 which was surreptitiously videotaped by a member of the audience. It covers all of the occult (hidden) symbols as used in organized crime, religious institutions, governmental seals, corporate logos, national coats of arms, and especially occult freemasonry operating behind the Vatican. An extraordinary presentation which has gone around the world.
