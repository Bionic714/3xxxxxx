Two great small programs freeware.Some exceptions freeware can be as useful as pd. programs with hd cleaner has many options easy to  use,clean your hd,file mask,search exceptions,wipe free space,shred files,search for duplicate files,find shared dlls,registry cleaner,a super clean,

my favorite option autoruns, some programs you use rarely will automatically set to run on start up,just open hd cleaner and delete what you dont want to or need on start up, for faster boot,faster start up,
 a uninstaller with option to open windows uninstaller
 search installed software,file splitter,anti-spy,
 easy access to drive information,with option to do a tree size information on your hd,
 dirT to html
 also can create back ups,,
 this program is small free and a great  program to have,
