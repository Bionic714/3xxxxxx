This is a documentary that´s possibly equally sad and funny - you really need to 
see the one woman bodybuilder who really can´t understand why she never gets any prizes at competitions.
Obviously nobody ever told her that her face has very much the features of a young man, thus making it a tad harder to succed in womens "beauty" pads.
