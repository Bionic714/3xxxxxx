-WHAT IMDB SAYS-
	Mad Max meets the Man With No Name in this futuristic story of a gunfighter (Joe Lara), who goes after a band of marauders who are terrorizing everyone and killing indiscriminately. As with the spaghetti westerns, the lone gunman enters into a town where the people have lost the will to fight back and proceeds to kill off the bad guys single-handedly. But once he is out-numbered totally and wounded, some do find the capability to fight back. Chief of those who try to aid him is a widow (Stacie Foster) with a young son. Brion James plays the general in charge of the marauders.

-WHAT REALLY HAPPENS-
	Man, that first line got it exactly.

-Notes-
How I'd like to think they came up with the idea:
"Noticing the similarities in style, tone and story between many of the post-apocalyptic scenarios and the classic American Western, that itself took much from the Japanese Samurai film, we set out to create a true exploration of the degradation of society after a nuclear holocaust back into a more natural state of survival."

How I'm sure it really happened:
"The West was pretty awesome"
"Yeah, but it'd be awesomer if it had cars and machine guns."

75% High Plains Drifter
25% Mad Max 2: Road Warrior

This is a really fun movie. There's nothing about it that's atrocious, I don't think it'd make a good MST3K, its just not that bad. It is however, extremely entertaining. Its got some really great fights, some awesome gunplay/showdowns, car chases and a badass lead with some pretty great lines. Its basically High Plains Drifter with machine guns, explosions and car chases added to it. Starring a guy who looks like that Gigilo from Duece Bigelo. Don't miss it!
