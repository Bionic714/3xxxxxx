Following are a couple of links relating to this (the first specifically mentions this documentary, check this out for background or follow-up info etc):

Also, a quote from the last article linked to above:

?While the Pentagon initially denied using white phosphorus in any capacity other than as an illumination round, reports from embedded U.S. journalists and a March 2005 Field Artillery magazine article published by the U.S. military said just the opposite. These two sources, coupled with Italian media and eyewitness accounts of civilians in Fallujah burned to the bone, forced the Pentagon to change from suggesting purity of motive (?we don?t use napalm or chemical weapons?) to a more nuanced and legalistic terminology. Now, it seems, white phosphorus was ?used as an incendiary weapon against enemy combatants.??

Thanks ReVised for seeding this."
