,Nat19,2007-12-16T00:47Z,"Thank you, perfect !  Nice acoustics too. Dont listen to the c08 idiot this one is great !"
,svedun,2008-02-14T18:54Z,"Nice torrent, no viruses whatsoever. Hard to burn the DVD though. DVD stops playing after appr 6 min. Burning it all to an ordinary folder works ok, but wirh no subtitles of course. Seems to contain a parental lock.
Any ideas? "
,svedun,2008-02-16T16:28Z,"Using the follwing freeware solved the problem: IZArc to extract, FreeDVD (to remove a UOps protection) and CDBurner to burn it.
Now I can enjoy a fantastic music DVD."
