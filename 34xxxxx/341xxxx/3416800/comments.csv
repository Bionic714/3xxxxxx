,kloktok,2008-07-19T10:20Z,"Kay Griggs was a Southern divorcee who rented a room to Marine Corps colonel George Griggs in the late 1980s.  She was impressed by his clipped manner, his education, his good looks.  Two months later she married him.  What she found out about world affairs as George Griggs' wife was astounding.

Colonel Griggs was a Marine Corps Chief of Staff, as well as head of NATO's Psychological Operations.  He was also, his wife realized, entirely mind-controlled.  Kay, a self-declared Christian, became privy to the real workings of the United States military, leadership training, drug-running and weapons sales, and the secret worldwide camps that train professional assassins.

These interviews with Pastor Rick Strawcutter of Adrian, Michigan were conducted in 1998, before September 11th and the installation of U.S. President George W. Bush. Kay Griggs' report of world events and the power elite paints a picture that begins to explain the hows and whys of our current global scenario.
Quotes from Kay Griggs:

""They took with them the most perverted aspects of Nazi Germany and brought them
over to the United States.""

""They get rid of the good guys. The Marine Corps are the assassins for the Mob. The military is run by the Mob. The military IS the Mob.""

""He told me what they did. They nurture--they cultivate--the sons of prominent families. They're called ""rising stars."" They rope them in. Then they ""turn"" them.""

ON ASSASSINS:  ""What my husband does for a living is train mercenaries -- young boys from countries like Romania, Dominican Republic, Haiti.  They're training them to be murderers, and the taxpayers' dollars are paying for this.  They psychologically profile them.  The profile is similar to my husband's and Lee Harvey Oswald's and [Timothy] McVeigh's, and others who were all part of this program.  Jeffrey Dahmer was part of this program.  They're all Army.  They were all picked out because they were perverted or twisted.  [The military profiles for] strong mother, weak father, no father, poor.  Because these guys are looking for security, so they will stay in the military and do anything for that security.""  (Interviews, Disk 1)

""When you work in the White House, you work under the Army.  The Marines have no overlord, as such.  They can float.  They're run out of New Orleans, just like Oswald was.  Oswald was homosexually recruited by Jack Rubinstein, who was Jack Ruby.  All of the funding for these operations goes through the ""joint"" -- the Mob.  Oswald was a loner, brilliant -- and a perfect candidate.  His [profile] and my husband's profile almost look alike.""  (Interviews, Disk 2)

ON TRUTH TELLERS:  ""St. Elizabeth's Hospital, like the Eastern State Hospital in Williamsburg, has Army intelligence people in there.  They're targets -- people who have decided to tell the truth.  People who believe in the American dream, who are Christians, who are trying to get things straightened out.  If they transgress that line where they upset somebody in high command -- just like in Germany -- they all of a sudden move from being a person to being a target.  Therefore, the enemy. Why are good people silenced, why are their papers gone through?""  (Interviews, Disk 3)

ON THE CIA:  ""This CIA thing, from my experience, is bogus.  Every person I've known who was in the CIA was in military intelligence first.  For example, my husband.  He works under the Army.  He's a Marine Corps high-level intelligence officer, but he's under all these Army people.""  (Interviews, Disk 3)

ON LOYALTY:  ""Now these generals in the Marine Corps and Army, according to my husband, they are ordered.  My husband, being Chief of Staff, told his men it was like this:  It's the Marine Corps first -- the Brotherhood, the Cherry Marines, the bonding that goes on.  The Marine Corps comes before God, before Jesus Christ, before the country.  My husband is not a Christian, he's an existentialist, and most of these guys are.  [Their god is] the Brotherhood.  It's very German, it has Masonic leanings.  They're all Masons"

It worked for her and morons are somehow brainwashed into listening to someone they do not know tell them about things they aren't experienced with. And since these people have never had any input from either side of the spectrum they believe whatever comes first and shut everything else out like a bigot.
  This torrent should be deleted for its ridiculousness and I hope if anyone watches it they have the mind to call BS on most everything instead of just eating the crap being fed to them.
 Government conspiracy theorist all need to get a job and get laid. Live your fucking life instead of creeping around trying to make up secrets for why it sucks. Mind your own damn business, live your life and it won't be so shitty. Stop making up shit because you are so bored you have to think everyone is out to get you. Godamn people..seriously."
,teleport,2009-10-19T21:01Z,"@fatalo : what's your source ? haven't got any ? of course you don't, that's why you don't know any better, you just believe what you want to believe so that your world won't collapse, poor being."
