Kay Griggs, wife of General George Griggs, USMC (retired USMC Commandant): 29th Commandant of the Marine Corps, found her husband's diary, which contains details of homosexual blackmail in the top ranks of the US Marine Corps - and names leading politicians and military leaders. Kay Griggs's information about the US government also comes from observations and people she met. She exposes initiation rituals, the raping of young men, pedophelia, and blackmail and murders to keep people quiet. Much of this, according to Griggs, is related to secret society activity and she names figures like Henry Kissinger, and a string of other top government individuals. 

These interviews with Pastor Rick Strawcutter of Adrian, Michigan, were conducted in 1998, before September 11th and the installation of U.S. President George W. Bush.
Kay Griggs' report of world events and the power elite paints a picture that begins to explain the hows and whys of our current global scenario.
