My Name Is Earl
#1.09: Cost Dad the Election
Tuesday November 22, 2005 (runtime: 30 mins)
Category: Comedy
Guest Stars : Beau Bridges, Kipp Shiotani
Earl sets out to mend his relationship with his father Carl (guest star
Beau Bridges) by trying to cross number four off of his list: "blew dad's
chance to be elected mayor." Four years prior, Carl ran for mayor to oppose
the other candidate's plan to redirect airplane traffic away from the
affluent part of town and towards Carl's neighbourhood. His campaign was
going very well, until a misunderstanding between Earl and a police officer
was caught on tape and broadcast as the opposing candidate's campaign
commercial. Now Earl submits his father's name to run again, even though
Carl is adamant that he does not want to be mayor. Earl, Randy, and
Catalina recruit unregistered voters to boost Carl's numbers, hoping to win
not only the election for Carl, but also a relationship with his father for
Earl.
