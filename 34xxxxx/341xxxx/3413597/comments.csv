[V],DownTYU,2011-05-19T17:04Z,"Hello
I am a wannabe torrent reviewer...
I am really interested in sorting the bad apples from the good one.
I make judgements of torrents (movies)
in the mirror of 1080p quality

THIS ONE IS NICE (according to the container avi and size)

P.S. If I make a wrong judgement plz comment on my post.
& if the uploader wishes to stop making this kind of review with siree's future torrents.He may ask me to stop and he won't see me again.

I have seeded exactly what I've taken, If I can so can you...Seed what you take.

Thanks"
