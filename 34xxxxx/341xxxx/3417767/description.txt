Tested to work, Installed version 5.0 then copied tomtom folder from archive over the tomtom folder on sd card.  Did not install prc files and worked fine so not sure what those are there for.

TomTom Navigator 5.12 for Palm OS

Installation instructions:
1) Copy the TomTom folder to your SD card.
2) Hotsync the two PRC files to your palm (cn.prc, start.prc).
3) Use it.

Hints:
- You can download the official update from: http://www.tomtom.com/3424
  After you finished the installation just copy the "Munich.bin" and "data.chk" in the
  TomTom folder of your SD card (overwriting the old ones).
- Maps are the same for Palm and PPC, so it doesn't matter what maps you're using.
- Succesfully tested with the maps "Benelux" and "DE AT CH PL CZ Plus".
  Others should work as well.
