This is a guide written by HoodedHound...
I have included in this guide as much as I could about hackers, crackers, piraters, and ect. This guide will tell you what they do, how they do it, why, and anything you would want to know...
This document is a guide to the bad side of the internet per say? Anything you can imagine? Even the tools they use, and all the different types including pictures...
It also includes other guides such as:

Hackers Code
Torrenting
Basic Networking
Art Of Ly-ing
Internet Security

I have spent a LONG time on these guides and I will be building on them... But I have gotten many many comments saying that these guides are the best in the business... Considering they were written by a Hacker... So, you know these guides are correct... Check umm out... Free Documents...

Wunna leave comments? There are ways to contact me in the guides...
