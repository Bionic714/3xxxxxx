The last version was built incorrectly, so here is the fixed version.

KR Maker is a tool to add your own songs to the original Karaoke Revolution for the xbox.

It's open source, written in java and works with Linux and Windows.

If someone can figure out Karaoke Revolution Party's ark file format, I probably could get it to work with that version as well.
