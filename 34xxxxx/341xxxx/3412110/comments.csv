,The_Gnutt,2006-04-27T11:45Z,"It's sad to see such a good and funny anime go to waste with such bad subtitles. The translation simply does not give the series proper justice, and the timing on the subtitles also seems to be off now and then. Search the net and see if you can find a proper release of the series as .OGM files instead, playable in Video Lan Client. OGM most times mean Ogg Vorbis audio, dual audio (Japanese + English) and also english subtitles (sometimes fansubs). I highly recommend it, because this series definately deserve it."
