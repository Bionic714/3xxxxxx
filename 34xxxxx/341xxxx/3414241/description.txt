bridge master 1993. dos version. i think it's the first version.

a colection of 240 hands and 5 skill levels. you have a bid and you have to make the contract as a declarer. all contracts are realizable and are explained very well. i think all hands were played sometime ago by some bridge-masters.

it's good for upgrade your playing skills as a declarer.
