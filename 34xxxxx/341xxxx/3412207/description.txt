This is my first up - tell me when something is wrong, do not yell at me.
My uplink is relative slow, so be patient and you are required to help
seeding to a decent ratio (a ratio of 1.0 is not good enough).

Summary:
  Liza Raines lost her hearing, but is offered to participate in a clinical
  experiment.  As the fourthteen patient in this experiment her treatment
  is successful and her hearing is now perfect again.  Too perfect, as she
  can now hear much, much more.  Why this happened to her and not the earlier
  patients and how to get out of the mess of knowing more by listening in
  forms the storyline.

Personal opinion of this movie:
  Worth a download and viewing, nice and entertaining but not special.
  Acting is quite good, and the speed and flow of the story is very
  good, though the plot develops quite predictable.  Consequently the
  ending is a little dissatisfactory.  All in all a 7+ on a scale
  of 1 to 10.  Mainly a good movie because it keeps up the pace.
