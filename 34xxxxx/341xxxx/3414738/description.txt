Mount or burn, whatever you want. 

To make it work on XP with latest direct-x you HAVE to patch the game. I have included the 1.2 patch and the 1.3 patch for direct3d, if you want the software mode or the glide mode patches, you can get it here:

Well, though I have the original, I never got beyond level one. I just couldn't figure out what to do, and this is the only game that I never found a walkthrough for, so if someone knows a walkthrough, please post at the comments section.

Enjoy and remember: if you are a real Klingon like me, share back what you take, it is the honourable thing to do for us warriors!

(By the way, because my download had a lot of errors in it, I am trying to redownload Babylon 5, season 3 disc 5. If some of you can help me to complete it, I would be very thankfull.)
