This is two great tracks if you like Janis Joplin, Jefferson Airplane or maybe Soundgarden. It's heavy and it's beautiful. At the same time.
I've "ripped" two tracks, "You gotta know" and "Mourning Pill" that the alternative rock band Wakestate published on their website, just so it won't be 

forgotten or disappear to outer space... the pictures are also taken from their website and 

I hope they don't mind. I haven't asked, really. It's for the greater good.

This band has chance to be one of thelegends, if they just realise how great they are! Keep 

telling them how good their stuff is, and maybe they will change their mind :)

Sad News

Hey guys--
It's Alexxx. I just wanted all of our fans to know that regretfully, Wakestate has 

disbanded due to personal and creative differences. It has been absolutely wonderful 

performing with WS, and I still love them all very much and wish them all luck in their 

future endeavors. Because a lot of you didn't get a chance to see our very last show (we 

didn't even know it was our last one), we are considering a date in late September with our 

friends Frequency Below. Our official website will be up for the remainder of the year, as 

well as our other site. Wakestate CDs can also still be purchased--though quantities are 

limited. Just email us at wakestatevox@hotmail.com.
In other news, I have decided to pursue a solo project which will indubitably be called 

Alexxx Calise. Right now, it is in the developmental stages, but I will keep everyone 

updated on that. For now, you can visit my personal Myspace site to see what's going on 

with me. 
Again, we thank you all soooooooo much for your continued support! 
-Alexxx-
