This .xiso is ready to burn and play just burn it using your favorite burning program but I recommend DVD Decrypter. Now on to the good stuff, I made this disc mostly for myself and for everyone who is having trouble downloading disc 1,2 and 3 consider this like a best of disc containing all the best maps out of all the past discs ?umm but its just my personal opinion as for the main menu it has pics of the maps ..even if you have the past released discs get this trust me its wroth it?
