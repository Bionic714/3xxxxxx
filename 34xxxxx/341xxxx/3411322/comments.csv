,DILDOPOO,2006-01-03T05:30Z,Very nice map pack. GREAT WORK
,xmodder,2006-01-09T14:50Z,"This is a great Pack however When I run it I get an error reading something like ""the files you've downloaded are incomplete or corrupt"" is this normal??  On the other hand Ive tried several of the maps with no problems. "
,xmodder,2006-01-10T13:16Z,"never mind the error is just XB Lives dash telling me it doesnt recognize the data. WORKS GREAT!!!!
Dont load on a box that allready has H2 on it or you will have probs (locks up sometimes) just burn and play off of DVD+R and its fine!"
