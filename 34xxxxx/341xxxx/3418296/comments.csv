I know you mean well by doing a spanned archive, But many OS's cant support that many (300+) concurrent opened files, such is the way bittorrent works all files being appended to are in an open state. Basicly it screws download performance on slower machines.
Try larger file size or something. Hell why .rar atall these days."

,ZeXoR,2007-08-12T16:33Z,bad seed!
,johanponken,2007-11-04T17:16Z,"Exactly. Get no rars here instead:

and a good quality too"
,napalm22,2008-01-19T06:24Z,"Bleh, may I ask WHY this is broken into 400 parts? Suppose I don't need eps 5,6,7,8. Now I'm downloading 1.3gigs I don't need.

The only time is ok to archive shit together is when every file is mandatory, such as a program."
,ANcap85,2008-04-06T04:29Z,"Great. Thank you very much :)

A piece of advice for the future though, dont RAR the entire season. If you want to RAR feel free to RAR single episodes, considering it is nice being able to pick and choose what episodes to download.

I, for example, prefer to download the first 5 episodes first, and the last 5 last. That way I can start watching it all before the entire download is complete.

As it is now, I cant.

Thank you though for the torrent. "
,goliathnz,2008-04-15T10:23Z,"I still think this must be the best way to go - at least each episode works out to be a managable size of 300mb... Mind you, I haven't tried to open all the rar files at once."
