 CVS/Compile Date....: 2005-12-09
 Compiler Versions...: XDK 5933, Visual Studio .NET 2003

 Optimizations.......: Custom mplayer.dll compiled from latest CVS with GCC 3.4.4
                       using --disable-libavformat. Greatly reduces the size of 
                       the dll at the cost of not being able to demux a few
                       obscure formats.

                       Scripts menu edited to include added scripts.

                       Project Mayhem III Webserver interface by KanadaKid.

 Release Notes.......: CVS had to be manually fixed by adding 'unsigned long
                       iOffset;' at line 19 of xbmc\lib\UnrarXLib\UnrarX.hpp.
                       Replaced the huge set of Mildrop presets with a set
                       containing only the best ones.
                       To remove either weather or IP address from home screen,
                       edit skin\Project Mayhem III\PAL\Home.xml (or PAL16x9).
                       At the bottom of the file, change <visable> from true to
                       false for the items you want to remove.
