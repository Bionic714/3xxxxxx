,Lord_Exide124,2006-02-10T14:16Z,MEn vad fan det finns ingen folder! lyssna på oss!
,Lord_Exide124,2006-02-10T20:47Z,"Oh...I´ve found it now...

Do like this: download Virtual CloneDrive at www.slysoft.com

and then right mouse click at the GTA vice city icon and choose Open With and then click Virtual CloneDrive and choose the FLT-VCB.BIN file. Then it should come a map and there is the crack...."
,Lord_Exide124,2006-02-11T10:56Z,"No that was wrong, do like this...

Download WinRAR because in daemon tools the BIN files are invisible. Download Virtual CloneDrive to. The site is www.slysoft.com...
Then you right mouse click on FLT-VCB.BIN file. Then you should click ""Open With"" and choose Virtual CloneDrive. When you did that it should come a folder and there is the crack."
,PirateStyle,2006-02-12T12:26Z,"hey base123 u need Daemon tools to install the game! install daemon and mount the bin files. and install it. what daemon tools does is tricking the computer, the computer belives that it is a cd in the cd port, but it isnt.
                                                       hope u get it work... very nice game"

2. Put it in your disc drve! the install will begin.
3. Use: www.filzip.com (Free) www.winrar.com (trial) or similar that supports .bin!
4. Unzipp.
5. Take out the .exe and replace it with the orginal in the Vice City folder"

,Goolman,2006-05-16T17:03Z,"w!dde, I think that mouse sensitivity setting in Windows has nothing to do with the one in the game, so you shouldn't expect for that to help. Try changing the in-game setting again or reinstall the game."
,crazedsniper90,2006-05-17T14:45Z,"hey i got a question..
after i mounted FLT-VCB with virtual clonedrive, there was this folder with -Audio , Crack folder and a rar file data3.
but when i tried to extract the rar file they said that the archive was either in unknown format or damaged.
anyway to settle this?"
,Goolman,2006-05-20T00:23Z,"But why did you wish to open the .cab file? I don't know what it's for but I've played the game and found no need to know. The only thing that needs to bother you, if you just want to play, is the crack folder."
,Goolman,2006-05-20T00:32Z,"Adding to what I wrote before, I had no problems whatsoever with burning both of the CD image files onto two standard 700 MB CDs. So, a word of advise: don't waste money on larger ones."

,termin8or123,2007-04-13T08:12Z,"Here is an In-Depth tutorial on how to install.

1. Get Virtual CloneDrive and Install

2. Right click FLT-VCA, OPEN WITH and it should say Mount Files With Virtual CloneDrive

3. After that is done, it will open up the install, and it will start installing.

4. About halfway through it will ask to put in the disc with the audio file. Right click FLT-VCB, and mount those files. Now locate F:/ and select it as the file for the disc. It will begin to install the rest.

5. Once it is done open the file you just mounted for the audio file. (F) Then there should be a folder called crack, go into it and copy the icon that says gta-vc. Paste that icon into C://Program Files/Rockstar Games/Grand Theft Auto Vice City. And replace the existing gta-vc.

THAT'S IT YOU'RE DONE! HAVE FUN!"

few months ago, i downloaded this torrent, and there was a major problem, my computer crashed and never started again, also, i couldn't install new OS because the HDD was broken. Never thought that the game was occuring this but now i'm quite confident, but after the new HDD was mounted to my pc and i downloaded this game again last week, the same happened: pc was fully jammed and HDD was making reading noise like: ""tr trrr tr . . . tr trrr tr . . ."" and it cycles. i can't install new OS on my pc aaargggghhh... however now i'm sure enough to warn those downloading this becouse that happened to me twice. question is, can a program harm computer so bad that a hardware can break down. yes, there is some tools that can fix errors in HDD etc. but still..."
,linkinpark187,2009-07-05T15:05Z,"jazzz3, software of any kind can not and will not kill your hard drive.  there are many factors as to what may have happened that caused that.  what brand of hard drive is it?  if it was a Seagate, then that could have been your problem, as there is a known issues with some Seagate firmware that can can actually lead to the death of their hard drives."

,JulianKingOfNothing,2009-07-11T18:59Z,"@reynouis:
try buning it on a dvd

and is this the game, cuz all other gta 4 torrents where like 13GB"
,reynouis,2009-07-12T18:20Z,"julian, the problem is..... for vice city you need 2 cd's ..... i dont have dvds and i can play gta sa cuz to instal it it only costs 1 cd.... so..... i can mount that single cd, thats why gta vc doesnt work"
,TotoManiac26,2009-07-14T14:08Z,"This game works perfectly fine. Thanks a lot.
I'm going to write a little tutorial, like it worked at mine:

1. Burn only the second part. Burn the CUE file! It's called FLT-VCB.cue
2. Download Winmount (google for it) and install and run it..
3. Click in winmount on 'mount file' and select the file: FLT-VCA.bin (this time the bin).
4. It should open a fake CD-drive. From there you can setup it. When it asks for the second CD, just put the CD you burned in the drive, then you browse for that drive (D:\ in my case)
5. Open from your burned CD the crack folder, browse to program files-Rockstar Games-Grand Theft Auto Vice City and put it there. The PC will ask you if you want to replace it, say yes.
6. Some people make here also a mistake: choose the crack filee in the program files, click RMB and choose: copy to desktop."

,zoorave,2009-07-22T20:49Z,could you mount it with daemon tools?
,erveli,2009-07-28T00:01Z,"okay tis is how i did it I used daemon tools.
1.download this file.
2.choose mount image, go to vice city folder that you just downloaded. choose Flt-vca and mount it
3.Installer should now open Install until it requests new cd.
4.now mount Flt-vcb. Now a new menu should open choose no actions.
5.installer asked a new cd, I mounted the cd as J tray so I browsed to J in the installer, klick ok.
6.Installation should now continue install.
7.when installation is done, mount Flt-vcb again.
8.the same menu as before should open choose to open in folder.
9.open crack there should be vice city logo kind of picture.
10.drag it to grand theft auto vice city folder you just installed, and select to owerwrite. ok
11. to play mount flt-vnb and choose no actions and open the logo thing (crack) from the installed folder.

Hope this helped. I did not burn any cds
sorry for my bad english an any typos."

,Dude1993,2009-08-08T15:50Z,"thx for the torrent. it's easy to install but I have 1 problem (i have it at gta san andreas too).

almost everything works fine but there is 1 thing that doesn't work perfectly. the game speed is faster sometimes and that's really annoying (example: one second in real time is 0.5 seconds on GTA) . I don't know why. I think it has something to do with my video-card cuz i have a new one.

this is what i have on my computer:

windows XP professional service pack 3
AMD Athlon 64 x2 dual core processor 3800+
2 GB RAM
NVIDIA GeForce 8600 GTS
i've updated my drivers to the latest version. (after i recognized  the problem) but it doen'st help.

Didnt need to burn any cd's.. Just use a virtual image programme like Daemon Tools... And if you dont know what to with a programme like that , read about it and USE YOUR COMMON SENSE!!!

If this game does indeed have a problem , dont come here to post about your problem - TRY AND FIX IT.

For example my in-game mouse is deactivated if i press ""ESC"" - Solution : Remount the image on Daemon Tools :D

3) open daemon tools and add image
4) the 'image' is in watever location u downloaded the torrent to
5) mount the image(u need to browse  etc etc and add the image file
6) there will be 2 image files..for cd 1 and cd 2
7) mount the 2 images on 2 different ""virtual drives""
8) wat daemon tools does is..it tricks the computer into thinking dat the cd is in the drive...actually it isnt
9) after mounting both cds..click on the first cd icon in daemon tools
10) setup will run automatically
11) halfway.. it will ask for cd 2.
12) As you have mounted cd2..just click ok.
13) installation finishes
14) now open cd 2(from my computer) 
15) there will be a crack folder...it will contain gta vc
16) copy this onto your installed directory (remember installation from cd 1??...the location you have chosen)
17) replace the gta vc file in your installed location with the crack file from cd2
18)  wala!!!!!

I picked up a copy of this game for 1.99 yesterday! Installed on my laptop, running Win 7-64 and it works perfectly :) That being said, i know from looking for potential compatibility probs, that others have had trouble getting it to run on Win 7. There are various solutions including turning off Aero, switching to XP compatibility mode...etc 

I'd almost forgotten how great this game is. If you're having difficulties getting it to run, get googling and persevere! It's worth it :)

Does anyone know if there's a no-cd crack available for Vice City? Nothing on GCW and so far, google's just throwing up dead links.

I HAVE GOT VICE CITY WORKING ON WINDOWS 7 WITH NO COMPATIBILITY MODES

If you are getting an ""Unhandled Exception - C0000005 at 006F6330"" error every time you try to run GTA, keep reading.

As you can see below I had a problem with Vice City, but I've *just* discovered how to make it work. The problem lies with Windows 7's DEP (Data Execution Prevention)

To fix it, do the following:
Delete .set file from your DocumentsVice City User Files folder
Open the Start menu, in the search box type ""advanced system settings"".
One result will appear, click it.
In the window that opens, click the Advanced tab, then the first Settings button
Go to the ""Data Execution Prevention"" tab, and click ""Add..."" to add an exception.
Browse to your gta-vc.exe and select it.
Now ""OK"" all the dialogs until they're closed. "
