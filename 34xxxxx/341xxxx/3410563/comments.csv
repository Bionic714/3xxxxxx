Looks like something is missing for Nastran in the license.dat file, but I've never used this before so I'm just wondering.

Regards"

Thanks"

1. Open the MSC_Nastran_Patran_2004 [LJ]License.dat file and change host on the first line to 

your computer name.

2. Run setup and install MSC.Licensing. 

When prompted for a license file point the browser to the MSC_Nastran_Patran_2004 [LJ]License.dat file.

3. Open Control Panel \ System. Select the Advanced tab and click on Environment Variables. Click 

on New to create the following variable.

Variable name: MSC_LICENSE_FILE
Variable value: 1700@host (host being your computer name)

4. Run setup and install MSC.Nastran. Use default settings.

5. Run setup and install MSC.Patran. When prompted for licence point the browser to the C:\MSC.Software\MSC.Licensing\9.2\License.dat file (repeat two times if necessary). Use default settings (even when prompted for the location of Nastran do not change it - accept default).

6. Restart your computer.

7. Run Patran 2004.

P.S. 8. If you want the Utilities Menu, copy the p3epilog.pcl file from C:\MSC.Software\MSC.Patran\2004\shareware\msc\unsupported\utilities to C:\MSC.Software\MSC.Patran\2004.

This is a 100% working torrent, problem was that there is no crack explanation. Considering how, even today, it's hard and rare to find Patran/Nastran - this should clear everything up. Enjoy and keep seeding this torrent.

Once I was able to run setup it all installed but did not except the modified Licence.Dat file saying specified server invalid.  Another words it wasn't tricked into thinking my computer was a server.

Any thoughts?"
