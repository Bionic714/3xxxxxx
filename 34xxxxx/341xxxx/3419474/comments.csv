,aith_note,2006-03-29T09:34Z,"also, does qfg5 work on xp??"
,Doggard,2006-03-30T21:14Z,Get slow dos or Dos-Box they are all dos games... think about it they will not even work on 98SE
,Doggard,2006-03-30T21:20Z,"I have a Sierra version of SQ 6 on 5.2 floppy but my MB will not support 51/4 disk drive.... though it will fit in the CD Holder.
I had to get a version that was on CD and still it skipped then someone told me this was due to the system being too fast and causing skipping so I was told to get DosBox.... Esencaly you runn dos through WinXP and Tune it down till it works..."

,AMD freak,2007-08-12T02:11Z,"I have owned, played and completed almost every one of these games on my old ATARI400/800/1040ST/Mega ST and IBM PC computers (and a few other's) back in the day. We had a big flood in the basement about 10 years ago and I lost all of my old games due to water damage. It made me sick :(

I used to be know as ""The DOS Master"" but that was way before Win98 came out. lol
I have never used DosBox but I have the latest version. Hopefully these files work and I can get them up and running.
I am downloading this right now and I will check it out to see what's up.

Thanx for sharing this anarxis.
