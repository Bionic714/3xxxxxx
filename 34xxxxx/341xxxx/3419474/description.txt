Almost all games have Solutions, codes and manual?
Don?t know if all works, but they should with some tweaking...

I would recommend DosBOX (included in torrent) for playing those games.
And READ Notes.DOC, it contains info about how to solve tec problems.

It DOES require some brain and medium basic DOS skills to make all games work?.

And I DON?T GIVE SUPPORT!!!!

I will seed the whole thing, but ill not seed 24/7 so DON?T PANIC!!!
