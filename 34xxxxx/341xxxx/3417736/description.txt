All of this is really me 
The first solo-album of Susanna Fields. Pure, intense and sometimes vulnerable and rocky at the same time.

The recipe for 'All of this is really me': 
Put Lisa Loeb, Sheryl Crow, Avril Lavigne and Coldplay in one big melting pot and combine it with Susanna's special voice and the progressive production... Et voilla!

Most of the songs are written by Susanna Fields, Minco Eggersman [At the close of every day, The spirit that guides us] and Ren√© de Vries [This beautiful mess, Rollercoaster 23]. 

This album is recorded at studio Dufry in Amsterdam and at the Mailmen studio in Utrecht. It is mastered by Martijn Groeneveld [Face tomorrow, Solo].
