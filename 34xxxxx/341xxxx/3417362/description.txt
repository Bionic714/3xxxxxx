Ted, Dougal and a host of other misfit priests become lost in Europe's largest lingerie department, and an ecclesiastical scandal seems inevitable.

Fortunately, Ted's Vietnam-style leadership brings the priests safely out, and for his services to the Church Ted is awarded a coveted Golden Cleric.

However, he uses his acceptance speech to wreak verbal revenge on each and every person who has done him down over the years. Meanwhile, Mrs Doyle fears redundancy when the Parochial House gets new technology in the form of a tea-making machine. Needless to say, everything turns out for the best...well...sort of.
