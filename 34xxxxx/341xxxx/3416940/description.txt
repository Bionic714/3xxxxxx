This movie contains the most beautiful, real, moving and the most convincing plot ever along with the best performance by a leading actor I have seen! It is simply about a man, that was told what to do and what not to do and finds himself in a situation were he asks himself what is it that he wants to do...He starts doubting about all he was told, when a murder occurs and he falls in love with the sister of the man that was killed.

Terry Malloy(Marlon Brando) becomes a hero, a man with courage, he isn't a saint or Indiana Jones but he has the characteristic of a real hero because he has done some bad things but anyway he is still trying to be good, he decides to be good even if that costs him his life, job, or friends. He is also a REAL man full of disappointments towards his brother Charley(Rod Steiger), who he adores and admires like no one else...he feels that because of Charley he was never somebody...it is all told in that famous cab scene which is one of the best and most acclaimed scenes in film history.

I really don't want to tell you more of what it is about...I will just tell you that it was so good that it actually became like a real experience. Brando's character Terry becomes real becomes someone you know and sympathize with...MARVELOUS. Not only the best I have seen, it has become my favorite I think.

One little flaw: the music. The music is good, but sometimes it is played were it shouldn't!!

SEE IT...please!!You will enjoy it. This is a perfect 10!
