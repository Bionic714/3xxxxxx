Johnny Cash: The Anthology (DVDRip, DivX)

Johnny Cash is, without question, one of the most powerful and important performers in the history of country music, and an artist whose influence has touched musicians as diverse as Marty Stuart, Tom Waits, and Elvis Costello. Emotional and real, his deep baritone voice and percussive guitar style created a bridge among various genres of music and earned him induction into the Country Music Hall of Fame, the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame and the Songwriters Hall of Fame. Johnny Cash: The Anthology is a video tribute to the Man in Black's remarkable life and career, in which Cash and some of his close friends from the music world perform a handful of his best-known songs. Guests include Merle Haggard, George Jones, Waylon Jennings, Rodney Crowell, and Glen Campbell. Scoring over 100 hit singles during his career, this film takes viewers on a journey which begins with the 1950s hit "Cry, Cry, Cry" and continues through the 1990s classic "Bird on a Wire".
