Release Notes:

Switch is the 11th studio album by the Australian rock band INXS. It will be
released on November 29, 2005.

It is notable for being the first album recorded with new lead singer J.D.
Fortune since the November 1997 suicide of Michael Hutchence.

The first single released from Switch was "Pretty Vegas", written by J.D.
Fortune and Andrew Farriss. It was released exclusively through iTunes Music
Store on October 4, 2005 for two weeks, where it ranked as high as #4 on the
top downloaded songs list.

In an interview with saxaphone and guitarist player, Kirk Pengilly, the last
song in the track listing for Switch, "God's Top Ten" is dedicated to
Michael Hutchence. It paints the singer as a "wild colonial boy, drifting
with the stars".
