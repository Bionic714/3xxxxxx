Thank u 4 yer time and sorry for the inconvenience."
,lfx0081,2006-02-27T10:58Z,"Its me again. I think I get it, some1 correct me if Im wrong. The reason it asks me for cds is to install soundtrack pro, dvd studio pro 4 and motion 2 and the file I downloade here is only Final Cut Pro 5, so I should no try ton insatll those other apps, just install final cut. If I wanna get those apps, I should downlaod em aswell.
Some1 please tell me if am rite or wrong as hell. Need to know, need to get this fokin thing workin, u know?

Anyway cheers...hastaluego amigos. Mas sabe el diablo por viejo que por diablo!"
,jonasfr,2006-03-07T23:38Z,"this torrent only includes final cut pro

,noc38mustang,2007-03-18T19:04Z,"If there's no serial number, there's a couple things I do.
First, I check TBP for torrents for keygens or serial generators for either that specific program or for whole program families (like Adobe for example).

If it's not on here, then google the same thing. Look up ""keygens"". 

So far, I've been able to download one for everything I've used so far with no problems.

Now, that's using a PC, not a Mac. But I can't imagine why the same thing wouldn't work for mac too.

Hope that helps."
,jenslindblom,2007-04-11T00:43Z,Hej någon som kan....! När jag dubbelklickar på Install får jag en dialogruta som säger att det är en .mpkg fil som inte kan öppnas utan program. Gör jag fel!? Vet någon?
,guillaume4,2007-06-02T07:35Z,"When I get to the screen to enter the serial number, I enter it but it doesn't have the option to continue from there, anyone know why this is happening or have the same problem?"
,J.Neptune,2007-06-27T16:21Z,"Okay, let me clear this up. This torrent does work -- and it's fairly fast for me. When you are installing it, the serials provided earlier work just fine (i'll repost them here.) You'll need them all. But you should not, and can not, install everything. When it asks you what to install, UNCHECK EVERYTHING THAT IS NOT ""FINAL CUT PRO"". Then install will run fine. DO NOT REGISTER THE PRODUCT, click 'register later'.

Everything for Final Cut Pro is here -- but if you want LiveType and Soundtrack, which are technically separate programs in the FC Studio package, you'll need another torrent.

Serials needed:
Serial: D-343-CLH-206-QGO-350-IQL-134-RXN-STP
DVD StudioPro3: C-342-SQZ-170-EAZ-340-AKZ-170-RMQ-PDY
FinalcutPro HD C-341-JEJ-170-WFU-341-VKV-170-RSZ-PDN
