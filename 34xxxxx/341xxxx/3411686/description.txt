50 Cent: Bulletproof (Xbox)


In 50 Cent: Bulletproof, 50 Cent gets caught in a web of corruption, double-crosses, and shady deals that lead him on a bloody path through New York's drug underworld. Teaming up with his G Unit crew, 50 Cent takes on the most dangerous crime families in the city, uncovering an international conspiracy with devastating implications. 50 Cent: Bulletproof features album tracks and new songs from 50 Cent recorded exclusively for the game, as well as more than a dozen 50 Cent and G Unit videos along with new original hot beats and scoring from Sha Money XL (G Unit Exec Producer). In addition, the game will offer a sound studio mode in which gamers can mix and match new original freestyles by 50 Cent with new beats straight from the G Unit camp.
