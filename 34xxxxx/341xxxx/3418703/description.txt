The Rock Snob's Dictionary Companion
The Rock Snob's Dictionary Companion hopes to further edify the burgeoning rock snob by supplying audio/video/photographic samples for each of the alphabetic entries in the dictionary. Neither the authors of the Rock Snob's Dictionary nor their publishers were involved in its creation.
This is an ongoing project - This is Rock Snob's Dictionary Companion Version 1.0

The Rock Snob's Dictionary
At last! An A-to-Z reference guide for readers who want to learn the cryptic language of Rock Snobs, those arcana-obsessed people who speak of "Rickenbacker guitars" and "Gram Parsons." ?Â ?We've all been there--trapped in a conversation with smarty-pants music fiends who natter on about "the MC5" or "Eno" or "the Hammond B3," not wanting to let on that we haven't the slightest idea what they're talking about. Well, fret no more! The Rock Snob's Dictionary is here to define every single sacred totem of rock fandom's know-it-all fraternity, from Alt.country to Zimmy. (That's what Rock Snobs call Bob Dylan, by the way.)
