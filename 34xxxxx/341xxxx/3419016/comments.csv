,xanxion,2006-10-09T21:16Z,"How do i get rid of that gay *PIL* error?
Must be caused by the internet. hmm maybe a firewall?
So they cant see if the Serial is used allready.."
,1PirateMike,2008-02-02T11:36Z,MY ANTI-VIRUS FLAGGED THIS AS A TROJAN HORSE WHILE UNZIPPING THE FILES!!!!!!!DON'T USE IT!!!!!
,piratehaven,2008-04-02T00:21Z,"Great thanks. No virus, don't listen to 1PirateMike. Must register with the name 'embrace' and use the keygen for serial."
,pittesn,2008-04-30T01:56Z,"downloaded, installed, licensed, no problems at all"

,phreak97,2008-08-22T17:14Z,"avgfree detects keygen.exe as a trojan, and even if  i ignore that and run it anyway, it comes up with an access error.. i think the keygen is a fake:("

,JustinSnow,2010-07-03T04:17Z,The torrent is safe. I don't know whats up with all the Rar files but the keygen works...
,JustinSnow,2010-07-03T04:21Z,"Instructions:
1.Download
2.Extract 'e-me5511.zip'
3.Run 'keygen.exe'
4.Generate key
5.open Macro Express (doesn't matter the version just that is macro express not pro)
6.Click on License
7.Name 'embrace'
8.Code 'whatever you get from keygen'"
,mi6003,2010-07-05T17:08Z,"Everyone saying this torrent has a trojan you are a bunch of fucking retards if you knew anything you would know that it is just the keygen, a keygen works by using a safe form of  trojan to sneak into the program and extract keys. Learn your stuff before you start complaining. As long as the actual programs dont come up as trojans and it is just the keygens it is fine."
,KirkH420,2011-01-05T04:38Z,"This file did not open for me with 7zip, the best file manager that exists. There are two compressed files both containing macro3.exe... one is a .rar and one is a .r00. Both report as Damaged/corrupt in 7zip. User be advised."
