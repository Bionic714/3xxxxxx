,mistergroenevingers,2009-09-19T02:39Z,"now this is actually worth the download
even though the tracks are not really the true originals it still gives you a good idea of what hardcore was like in the old days
though most tracks seem to have been sped up significantly (a shame)
thanks wytse for the best thunderdome download i found so far"
