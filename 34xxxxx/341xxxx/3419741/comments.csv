Less than 20MB to go my friend. Did I mention how much I love you? It's real my friend. Anyhow...this is such an excellent period for FZ concerts, I was wondering could you give me those last MBytes I so desperately need and crave my friend. Regardless, I will always love you forever, Green Panther, you wonderful being."
