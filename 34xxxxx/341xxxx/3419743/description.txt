I am not associated with Globalroms.com, or the usual posters of the MAME torrents, but I felt that having to download 7 update torrents was a hassle.  

Since the folder for this torrent is "roms", it should be possible to seed directly from your MAME folder if you know what you are doing.  (use caution for course.)

********** Normal instructions below *****************************

This merged MAME ROMs update is for people with complete sets who want and need to have the very latest ROMs the MAME team releases! Updating MAME ROMs v0.98u2 to v0.102, and they will only work with a v0.102 EXE. If you don't have a copy, there's one included in the torrent for you. These updated merged ROMs are complete and ready to use and should be placed in your ROMs folder overwriting the old ones. If you're still in the process of downloading the complete "MAME v0.98u2 Merged ROMs Collection", then you NEED TO WAIT until you have the complete (100%) collection downloaded before you're able to use any updates. Also, you need to remember that once you've updated your ROMs, you will no longer be able to seed certain ROM packages, where ROMs have been changed. Unless of course you made some back-up copies before you updated your ROMs.

Soon Globalroms.com will offer MAME ROMs and MAME ROM Updates for direct download!
