This is a Re-do of a torrent that I did several months a go by Request.

This is Roy Buchanan at his greatest in 1974 and defied the laws of the way a guitar is played and with only a Fender Telecaster!! No one has ever come close to touching Roys style and yet so many tried. Roy Buchanan died in August of 1988. I saw Roy in October of 1987 in Dallas, Texas and was Blown Away. Most people in attendance for both shows where Guitarist and it was funny watching 30 & 40 year old men Screeming like girls when Roy Tore up Hey Joe!! What an honor it was for me to get to talk with Roy several times that night and ask me of all people, questions. Roy offered to sign my Telecaster when I asked him (Roy) and said that he would and Roy said that would be great!! During the intermission, Roy walked over to me and asked where the Telecaster was and I told him that I had parked so far away that I thought the guitar would be stolen and I would be knocked in the head. Roy said that he understood and asked me too stay for the second set because he was going to pull out all the stops with a big smile and I was so intemidated that all I could say at this point was cool. I had a Farley Moment. Farley from SNL.
