Product Description:
Unique compilation of Deep Purple/Rainbow guitar slinger Ritchie Blackmore's 60's sessions. Title track is one of the rarest, most collectable singles of the 60's. Features many other collectors rarities. Long before he formed Deep Purple, Ritchie Blackmore had already won a sizeable reputation amongst London?s musical cognoscenti. As a sessionman and as featured guitarist with Joe Meek?s Outlaws, he had been showing off his skills since the dawn of the 60s. Getaway features the pick of these collectable 60s outings, including his legendary 1965 solo single, his cameos with stars such as Heinz and Lord Sutch, and his contributions to the mysterious Green Bullfrog project.
