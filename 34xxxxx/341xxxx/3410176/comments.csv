,airman123,2008-01-18T11:52Z,"If you have downloaded this torrent, then you have helped put PSS out of buissness. That means they will make no more addons. For proof, go to ""http://www.phoenix-simulation.co.uk"" and see for your self. I hope your happy!"
,ac777,2008-05-20T00:55Z,How do you install these files? I copied them into the pss texture folder but still not working! Any help appreciated!
,greecerocks,2008-11-15T02:59Z,"thanks for the file GoLeafs!

but as for airman123, fuck off man. i have looked at most of the PSS 777 files and you have posted the sam thing over and over again, so once again FUCK OFF!!!! you have contributed too, becuz i highly doubt that you haven't downloaded anything off of TPB. so go home and as another person said, go stick your head up your ass, see if it fits"
