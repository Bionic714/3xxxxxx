,talassa,2010-03-01T20:13Z,"beautiful film.

,rowantree,2011-03-21T02:36Z,"Great quality, I understand the English subtitles are in the .srt file but I don't know how to do that."
,SoundGuy321,2011-03-31T17:35Z,Use DivX player and keep both .avi and .srt in the same folder. Divx should find the .srt when you open .avi. And thanks for the upload.
