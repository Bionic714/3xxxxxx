""Paint it black"" is on a newer (not authentic) version of the album /Aftermath/. The 1966 release carried ""Mother's Little Helper"", which in 1986, when the newer version was released, was probably considered politically incorrect and replaced by ""Paint It Black"" -- since it's the story of a woman getting high on pills while cooking for her husband and taking care of the kids..."

It was given to me by my oldest sister cause she thought it was terrible. It was my very first album, and Paint it Black was most certainly on it. Wow that was along time go...I think if a change was made it was way back in 1966 and not as late as 1986.
