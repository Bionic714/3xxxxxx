,LetterX,2007-03-05T02:10Z,"Okay, for the idiots who don't understand simple stuff: When you download it, note one thing, if you ALREADY have a version of windows, uncheck the Windows 2000.dmg file.You do not need it. Plus, it will make your download go faster and take a shorter time (not downloading 337 MB). After downloading this, you open it up. It then will eventually come up to a screen and say it needs the serial. Well, the serial can be located in the ""ReadMe"" File. (get the ""Readme""?) You Copy and Paste it into the Box, and well ah! You now have Virtual PC. Virtual PC will ask to set up manually or not, if you have a Windows CD, click manually. Go through the rest of the steps and then put the Windows CD into your CD/DVD drive and double-click on the Virtual PC you created and then it will ask to boot from CD, hit any key (do so) and it will start Set-Up! Well, there you go, you now have to wait like 1 to 2 hours until it finishes and you have a Pentium II with MMX Technology PC!"
