,roccomochi,2008-11-14T22:29Z,"HELP PLEASE!! i installed setup from iso and everything installed fine. interface shows, but everytime i try to load or do auto search for the brass library it says its missing and cannot find, but there are files in the brass library directory!

was i suppose to unzip unrar all of the ""dm-qlsobrass1.r00, .r01, .r02, .r03 etc...? those take so long to unzip and they all hold the same size files, so i dont know if i should unzip them all?

also other programs have multiple .r00, .r01 etc files but i did not need to unzip them for my program to run perfectly so i dont know if i need to do it to this symphonic brass or was the iso mount and interface install enough?

can u tell me everything i need to unzip? all 20 something of the .r00 files or just the .rar ?

and do i need to install them all to the same folder? even the one where the unzips are downloaded to?

thanks a milllion to any replies. peace."
