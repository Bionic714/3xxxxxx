Have you been playing WoW and are looking for something better? Then this game is something for you! 

How to get started:

1. Download the game.

2. Run the game by using "l2.exe" located in your system folder.

3. Log in and the server will create an account for you as you attempt to write a user // pass. DONT USE THE "Create account" option.

4. Enjoy!

[If you think that the download runs slow download the full game from 

www.lineage2.com

and then download our patch from

www.zdanpol.com.pl/valhalla_patch.exe

Install this patch in your system folder.]


Known problems: 

When installing the patch it places the files in "program files" by default make sure that you install it correct. 

If the game chrashes and when you attempt to start it again you get an error regarding your gameguard. Erase the gameguard folder in the "system" folder and start the game. 

Some ppl are running the game with the executable directly in your lineage folder. DON'T cause it will start to upgrade your game to work with theoffical servers.

THE SERVER IS RUNNING WITH AN LEGAL EMULATOR AND IS FULLY LEGAL!!
