,salonemusic,2009-07-31T15:34Z,"Hmm. Video is 224x176 at the wrong aspect ratio (4:3 instead of 16:9) and Audio is 448 !? kbps. Not the best use of bandwidth, I would say. Nevertheless, if you re-compress the audio to something reasonable (like 192 kbps mp3) with VirtualDub, and then deblock the video on playback, you get a fairly watchable result from a ~500 MB package (after Vdub remux). Thanks for the upload.
