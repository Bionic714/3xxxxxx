,Doc_Mason,2006-01-04T20:01Z,load both CD's at one time in Daemom tools. If you would have READ the instructions you'd have it installed by now.
,hat.af.bast,2006-01-06T19:23Z,"Installed perfectly and no troubles by the way. But when I've been in the game for like 10 sec. moving round and stuff like that, the program quits, telling an error was found. Any solutions?"
,jusanotherthief,2006-01-07T02:44Z,"works great, downloaded in 6 hours-no problems.       
thanks.  For people who dont know what thier doing as far as mounting disc 1,then disc 2 and so on.(daemon4)
mount disc1,when asked for disc 2 mount over disc1(DONT UNMOUNT DISC1)it will say ""blah blah blah""THEN CHOOSE IGNORE and continue installing.

hat.af. if you could be more specific about the error, I or someone else might be able to help."

just like some other people on here,
i had some problems with the file.

when i start the game, it suddenly shuts down and i get two error-messages, the first being ""Fatal Error: Failed tu usrTxInitTexture()' and the other being ""Microsoft Visual C++ Library: Runtime Error! - Program: ...s/VUGames/Leisure Suit Larry - Magna Cum Laude/larry.exe - R6025 - pure virtual function call"". I did everything according to your instructions ánd tried using a different no-cd crack, but it keeps on giving fatal errors and shutting down.

could you, or anyone else, help me with this?
i'm kinda n00bish."

When you move the camera it seems the textures are existing in some sort of vortex above the characters.

Anyone else experience this or know how to fix it?"
