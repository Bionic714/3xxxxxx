This is the sound that was played when Scottie recieved an e-mail in the movie Eurotrip. Whether or not you have seen the movie, this is a pretty cool sound clip. It goes well in any e-mail client software instead of the default sound. Please seed when finished downloading. It is a 19kb file, and will take very little bandwidth to upload. It takes less than ten seconds to upload with a broadband connection. If you have dial-up, well you really shouldn't be using Bittorrent. Get broadband.
