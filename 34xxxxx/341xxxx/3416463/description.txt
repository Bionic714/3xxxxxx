Hello!

Here it is an unofficial calendar 2006. 
I made it with the pictures I made during the world tour 2005. 
Pics are from Lyon, Paris, London, and Milano.
The format is PDF you can open it with Adobe.Acrobate 7.0
I hope you'll like! If you do, you can print it, it looks really better on a good quality paper.
