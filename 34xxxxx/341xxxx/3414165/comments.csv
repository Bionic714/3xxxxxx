,2much2do,2010-08-10T06:32Z,"Can anyone give me a run through of how to install this game?  I've created an image of both disks and mounted them using powerISO, but there is no installation application.  What do I do with all the files?"
,Zerounl3,2010-12-14T06:04Z,"Alrigth Guys, I recently just found out how to install these games.

1.  Get first file (in this case CD 1) 
2.  Select ALL files within the folder CD1 
3a. Either get unrar or install winrar
3b. Winrar, after selecting ALL files right click and select 'Extract here...'

4.  After the extraction finishes, you should get 
     2 new files, a small .image file and a large 
     image file. (around 770 mb)
5.  Get daemon tools lite, and mount that Large 
     image file.
6.  application starting should pop up.

7. Do this for other folders etc... CD 2 

8.  enjoy1 :-)"
,K1LLB0T,2011-01-04T06:43Z,"IF THE GAME QUITS TO DESKTOP UPON LAUNCH (i.e. shader sync error), take these steps:

1.) Explore to the mods\bf2 folder where you installed the game (i.e. ...\Battlefield 2\mods\bf2)
2.) Locate Shaders_client.zip and extract the contents to the Battlefield 2\mods\bf2\shaders folder.
3.) Play!

,SiiMi,2011-04-23T21:07Z,How To Install Battlefied Special Forces And Crack...?
,AceDOOM,2011-04-28T03:16Z,"BE ADVISED!!!!!!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
IF YOU HAVE A PIRATEED VERSION OF BF2 AND YOU DOWNLOAD THIS FOLLOW THESE STEPS!!
1. Uninstall the original
2. Reinstall DO NOT SWAP THE CRACK from the original source launch!!! (this torrent requires a patch before it installs the xpac swaping the source WILL cause malfuntion and a black out followed with a imediate end of process)
3. Install the xpacs torrent files by unziping/mounting the image.
4. Use the given start up to play offline (Note: you can play online but only on private servers or non-punkbuster or non-secured servers.)
Enjoy peeps!! also i have not tried BUT feel free and if it does work ill repost but after you follow the above steps you can THEN try swaping out the source launch with the cracked launch... your welcome guys. duces!"
,AntBond,2011-05-31T15:55Z,"Thanks, works perfect. Just install BF2, install BF2:SP and THEN patch 1.41 and 1.50. You don't need any crack, because there is no need of a cd since patch 1.50."
,irfinity,2011-06-27T08:44Z,"What patch is included in this?
I already had bf2 cracked by reloaded, I then Istalle this, (Patch was automatically installed after the game installation, dont know which version), I manually installed ver1.41. Still BOTH BF2 and SF exit soon after blank screen.
NB. Copied all the shaders bt to no avail."
,Zeptinune,2011-08-02T15:52Z,"I downloaded the -RELOADED release of BF2 then I am getting this for the weapon unlocks because I heard that for playing a single SP map you get 3 unlocks after like 5 minutes. I am sick of all the leveling bullshit because you need like 10,000 points for next rank after last one was just 1,000.

I have a legit BF2 key though so yeah. I don't know about this one, I'm gonna have to use a Keygen or try and find a key off some site that not many would go to. I'll see if I can install this over my current BF2 and then get the unlocks and play online without getting banned. Single player is a load of shit."
