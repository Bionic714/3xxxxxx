Terence Kemp McKenna (November 16, 1946 - April 3, 2000) was a writer and philosopher. He was notable for his many speculations on subjects ranging from the Voynich Manuscript to the origins of the human species to Novelty Theory, which claims time to be a fractal wave of increasing novelty, which culminates dramatically in 2012. (see Eschaton). McKenna's theory is related to the theory of the technological singularity, except that McKenna advocated what he called an Archaic Revival as the antidote to what he saw as the self-destructive nature of unchecked, technological development. This concept appeared to involve a combination of hallucinogenic chemical agents, Gaianism, and shamanism.
