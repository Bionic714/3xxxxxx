-WHAT IMDB SAYS-
	Set in a distant post-apocalyptic future when the environment has been blasted into a poisoned wasteland and society has degenerated to rule by competing hordes of marauding gangs. There is one warrior, though, who fights to bring some semblance of peace and order to the land. When his family is brutally murdered, however, he becomes obsessed with seeking out their killer and taking his revenge.

-WHAT REALLY HAPPENS-
	A guys family is killed, said guy seeks vengeance.

-Notes-
Surprise! As if you couldn't tell, I have a serious addiction to Post-Apocalyptic films. I'll take the good ones like Road Warrior if possible, but there sure aren't many; and they made so many goddamned bad ones, its irresistable. 

This one isn't actually all that bad. Its got your necessary cheesy lines and story, nonsense logic, and crazy bad guys, but as far as others I've seen, it actually holds up pretty well. Its got some good blood, the hero looks the part and can handle himself fairly well (unlike Nomad Riders which I neglected to release due to its boringness) and the chick isnt too bad looking either.

I have no access to a camera this week, which is unfortunate because this movie's coveris hilarious. Some stand-in with a trenchcoar and all these baddass automatic weapons stands in an airbrushed badland with Road Warrior-esque vehicles behind him. Guess how accurate it is...I included a Russian cover I found with GIS so you can check it out.
