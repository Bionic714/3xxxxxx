,Krickaan,2006-01-21T23:58Z,"I can't register this one, and if I don't, I only can use it in 5 days! When i try to register, it say 
""Irregular System ID
The system ID you are using is invalid. In order to prevent software abuse, your user data, IP number as well as other available session data have been sent to the NI webmaster. This data will not be saved indefinitely but will be verified.""

,bigruudz,2006-03-11T03:23Z,"Has anybody got this to work yet?  I am using a Powermac G5, and it looks like its a hybrid type setup.

,danespen,2006-03-14T14:22Z,Worked fine for me on my PC
,carl_ejay,2006-03-15T16:23Z,Do you need a VST-instrument to use the program or does it work fine without???
,bigruudz,2006-03-16T19:26Z,"Can somebody give a step by step on how to do a successfull install?

And if possible, I cant use the Serial generator on my mac as it is a .exe file, it would b great if someone could pm me a serial number...thanks...80%!!!!!"
,bigruudz,2006-03-18T00:05Z,"Ok...

So you only get 5 days with this thing because when you go to register at NI'S website the system ID is invalid...meaning they are on to the crack i guess.

If someone could find a way around this and share that would be great.  The instruments sound freakin awesome by the way!!!

If someone has found a way around this plse share...I am seeding this as are other people, but its useless without some way around this."

this worked great last time I installed but now I had the exact same problem with the keygen on my new computer.
you need to uninstall your virus-protection, It's not enough just to close the app. 
atleast this worked for me"

Thx."
,blackmarketmuzic,2008-10-28T05:57Z,AVG finds the keygen as a trojan.  I downloaded this a long time ago but then had to wipe my computer. So now i downloaded it again but i'm too afraid to execute the keygen so i'm opening the keygen on a school or library computer and just taking down the serial. HOPEFULLY it doesnt require a system ID.  Does it need your system id number? anyone?

When you have downloaded it, either disable Resident Shield in AVG or add an exception to ignore files in the folder where you are extracting the RAR file (double click Resildent Shield -> Manage Exceptions).

I was originally just going to buy the VST until I read on the website that your not allowed to make any profit off your music is you use their instruments. Well I'll be damned if the charge me hundreds of dollars for software then dump that shit on me.
Anyway, I was having a little bit of trouble updating the libraries but I eventually figured everything out. Read the instructions very carefully and you shouldn't have any problems. Everything is in the text. Thank you for this awesome upload!
Please help seed!"
,Arecibo,2010-02-26T06:14Z,"Beartheshadows,

You're a fucking idiot.

Directly from their website:

""How can I use the sound samples?

You may use the sound samples in combination with other sounds within your musical compositions. You may release such compositions commercially, without payment of any further fees or royalties for such usage. For example, if you are the original purchaser of a Sample CD (or you download sound samples from this site), and you use the sound samples from it to create the soundtrack of a television commercial or a track on a music CD; regardless of how many CDs are sold or how many times the television commercial is broadcast, you would never have to pay the producer of the sound samples any additional royalties or license fees, because you already purchased a license to use the sound samples commercially.""

Don't use your ignorance to try to justify anything. Say that you're stealing because you're cheap, like most of us, and move on without the lies."
,Arecibo,2010-02-26T06:19Z,"By the way, that completely ignores the facts that:

1) You were probably never going to sell any of your music anyway

2) If it WERE true that you'd have to pay to use their samples as part of commercial compositions, how does pirating it help? You're still violating the terms of usage of the software that you have to agree to when installing, PLUS you've pirated it.

But to pull this out of the land of hypotheticals, point me to where I can buy your music, since your (mis)perception of such a restrictive policy was such a great limitation that it was a deal-breaker for you. "

"
,6EELZE6U6666,2010-03-16T23:44Z,"Thanks so much HrJacob you are a legend!!! awesome torrent...

ok guys i know alot of you are having trouble getting this software installed so heres as simple as i can make it.

Step 1: mount the 1st iso file and install setup

step 2 : open the keygen and click ""generate"" to get a serial key
(if you have trouble downloading or opening the keygen, i'm afraid the best thing to do is uninstall your virus protection) ((its the only way utorrent would let me download it))

step 3 :  enter the serial number and add any user name you want.

Step 4: complete the installation, at the end it will give you your computer ID code...copy this into the keygen (under ID tab) and click generate this will give you your registration code (paste this code into notepad)

step 5: enter your registration code into the boxes at the bottom of the installation page and click enter, now it is CRACKED!

step 6: now open east west, where you saved it into your computer eg, C: / Programs / east west
and paste in the 2 NKS files (located in the iso file) 
into the ""east west library"" file (C: drive)

step 7: mount the next iso file and paste the next 2 NKS files into this folder

step 8: repeat for the next 2 iso files

step 9: ENJOY!!!

this is as simple as i can make it... if you still do not understand, or if you still can't get it to work then you are a total n00b and dont deserve this awesome software
(remember to reinstall your anti-virus!)"
,anonacc,2010-03-18T01:02Z,"Awesome torrent!

I had to uninstall AVG to run it, though; I don't think the keygen will work with certain Antivirus programs installed. I don't think it's an actual virus, as nothing has happened to my computer thus far. 

If you don't know how to mount .iso files, use something like Daemon Tools Lite (it's free). It's as easy as right click, mount image (need to browse for the .iso file). With that, follow 6EELZE6U6666's instructions.

Make sure you paste the .nks files into ""...\EWQLSO Gold Edition\EWQLSO Gold Library"". It should be in the same area containing the folder called ""Instruments"" (this is after install).

I think someone asked how to decode the "".nks"" files. You're not supposed to decode them into individual sound files, you keep them as .nks. Certain programs, like FL studio, can read the sounds directly from .nks.

To use this program with Fruity Loops as a VST plugin, this is what I did:

1) Open FL Studio (I have v8, so it may differ w/ other vers)
2) Select ""Channel"" from the main toolbar, then select ""Add One."" Then select ""more."" Look at the bottom of the screen and click ""Refresh"", then ""Fast Scan (Recommended)"". Wait for EWQLSO Gold to appear on the list. I think you can check-mark it off.
3) You may need to restart FL Studio.
4) Select Channel --> Add One --> EWQLSOGold. The Kompact player will appear. Select whatever instruments you want in whatever channel you want.

There might be other ways to get it to work. This is just what I did."
,WhenUSave,2010-03-20T15:01Z,"Keep in mind that if you are opening Keygens, Some backdoor programs will be opened to. Like spyware, virusses etc."
,EricFish,2010-04-10T20:14Z,"HAHA! A Mac User here that got this stuff WORKING! Sounds amazing, and here's how you do it:

1) Download this torrent. It takes a while, but totally worth it.
2) Burn them onto DVDs, back the ISOs up on externals, I don't care what you do. Just make sure you don't accidentally delete anything and have to redownload this. That would be a serious pain in the ass.
3) There is a torrent out there that includes the Kontakt 2 player for Mac. Download it here: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3853441/Native.Instruments.Komplete.4.Mac.OSX.Cracks.UB-DYNAMICS
It doesn't matter how much of it you download, just as long as you get Kontakt 2. The beauty of this is that Kontakt recognizes and loads the protected .NKS files. However, since it is an older version, there is no online registration required. 
4) Install Kontakt 2.
5)Move the .NKS files to your hard drive. ALL of them. AND the Instruments folder on the FIRST .ISO. Put them all in the same folder, within subfolders labeled ""Instruments"" (for the Instruments files) and ""Samples"" (for the .NKS files).
6) Hit the ""Options"" button at the top of the screen. Go to the ""Search/DB"" tab, and hit ""Add."" Add the folder that encloses your ""Instruments"" and ""Samples"" folders, which house your Instruments and .NKS files respectively.
7) You need to add the .NKS files, and the instruments, to Kontakt's database. To do this, hit the ""Database"" tab, then directly below that you will see a ""Rebuild DB."" Hit this, and you should see a window pop up, which tells you that Kontakt is going to search for the samples within the folder that you specified in Step 6. Hit ""Rebuild"" and wait for a bit. Be patient, it takes a while.
8) Once you have done this, open Garageband. Hit any virtual instrument, then go to ""Edit"" and select the ""Kontakt2"" sound engine. Hit the graphic next to the buttons that allow you to select your sound engine to open up the Kontakt 2 plugin. Browse through your folders under ""Database"" until you reach the level that shows a bunch of folders labeled ""10 Cellos,"" ""10 Violas,"" etc. 
9) Select one of the aforementioned folders. In the lower browser window, you should see a list of samples. Double click one. A window pops up telling you that Kontakt can't find the samples. Hit ""Search Database."" It takes a minute, but it will eventually load the sample. Save as a virtual instrument in GarageBand, and then go to the next sample, and do the same thing (Search database, then save as a different Virtual Instrument). Do this for as many of the instruments as you will use (I did it for all of them, took about 3 hours total)
10) Enjoy your instruments!

I think it also has a batch patcher, but that didn\'t work for me, so I just dragged each nki file onto the application and patched them separately. Then you can load the nkis and it will load the samples from all the nks libraries, and it will work.

Yeah it starts with cello and ends in violin but i do think the torrent is legit and has all instruments included.

,AaronWilde,2010-08-14T23:49Z,"Hey slamdanicn..

After researching a bit i think i found out that whoever made the torrent did not include the multis in download other wise they would be in disc 1's iso where the library is, so definately no multi's in this torrent"
,AaronWilde,2010-08-15T00:07Z,"My mistake.. Officially there are no multi's included in gold edition of symphonic orchestra so everything is actually ok and working, you have to make your own multi's then save them, for example for strings; violin, violin 2, cello, viola and double bass and so on, apoligize for false input"

Hey i also downloaded the east west RA. Its awesome u should dl it"
,AaronWilde,2010-08-15T00:58Z,"Haha at the same time!

That may be a problem the fact you can't save ensembles i saved 1 but it doesnt show up when i want to load it although i can see it in the folder i saved it, i think you have to make a folder in your in your library next to instruments folder on your hard disk then save it there(its default location if multis were included in gold edition), if you seen people playing ensembles its either because they have other versions installed too or have saved their own, i think its best to make your own anyway, sounds more natural..

whats RA?"
,AaronWilde,2010-08-15T01:02Z,"Just to confirm.. i know im posting comments all over this torrent but for people having trouble with multi's(ensembles), they are not included in gold even in the official version but if you make a folder where your installation destination was should look something like D:\EAST WEST SYMPHONIC ORCHESTRA\EWQLSO Gold Library that is where you make a multi's folder then save them to there and it works"

Double click ""setup.exe"" and it should start the installer. Click next until it asks you for a serial. Start up the keygen and generate your serial with it, and then copy in the empty boxes in the installer procedure. After that click next until the installation starts (be carefull in what drive you install this, cause you'll need at least 14 gb of space). After the setup has finished ti should ask you if you want to start, place shortcut etc... just uncheck everything except the last one I thnik (where it asks you if you want to REGISTER it or something with that). Click next and it should open up a window with the registration options. You should also see your system ID in the first box(it consists of bnch of random numbers. Copy those numbers, open up your KEYGEN if it's closed and go under ""keygen"" next to ""serial"" in the window of the keygen. In the box it should say something like this ""please enter your system-id and click generate"". Remove that and copy the ID you copied from the registration window. Click generate. It will say something about copying to clipboard or something like that. Go back to the registration window and underneath you should see step 2. Click ""PASTE FROM CLIPBOARD"". After that underneath clikc ""COMPLETE"". IT SHOULD say that you registered the product. Problem about the 5 days trial is finished.

NEXT, if disk 1 is still mounted (it should be lol) COPY THE FILES ""EWQLSO_Gold_lib_part1.nks"" and ""EWQLSO_Gold_lib_part2.nks"" and PASTE THEM IN (depends on witch hard drive you installed, this is default) c:/Program Files/East West/EWQLSO Gold Edition/EWQLSO Gold Libary

Mount the onter four discs and copy those files in the same folder ""EWQLSO Gold Libary"". After that start up ""WEQLSO Gold Edition"" and it should work like a charm.

It's pretty straightforward.

I know hos stressfull it is to download a HUGE file like this and then have problems, soo this should cover all areas about it.

If anyone has ANY questions regarding THIS softare and the installation process, don't hesitate to ask.

John."
,RB78,2010-12-13T01:55Z,"Thanks John for the outstanding instructions. You got me much further than I would have been able to on my own. However, I am not quite there yet and hopefully you or anyone might be able to lend a helping hand. I followed your directions to the tee and was able to successfully (supposedly) install the software. But I am not able to copy the .nks files to the library. I am using a mac and had to go through a tremendous amount of trouble to make it happen. I had to use crossover to get to the point I am at now. But the problem still seems to be that I cannot copy the .nks files to the library--the folder does not seem to want to allow it. Secondly, I tried to open the program regardless of having had included the .nks files, but the program seems to do nothing. It appears in my dock as if it were to open then disappears. I've tried to open the program through crossover as well, and still nothing. Any help from anyone would be greatly appreciated because I really want to obtain this program. 

Thanks in advance,

RB"

,Thomaat94,2011-01-22T23:13Z,Can someone please give me a working key or keygen!? It says it's a virus
,r_bewick,2011-02-02T00:55Z,"USEFUL INFO:

->Follow colazex's instructions

->Keygen: may be detected as virus by some antivirus software but is clean and fine to use. If you have a problem just disable your av while using and then enable afterwards.

->Playing more than 1 instrument at once: make sure EACH instrument added is set as OMNI (in the multi section under transpose on the left) instead of a number.

-> For multis: just confirming AaronWilde: 
Make a new folder in 
a) 64-bit
C:\Program Files (x86)\East West\EWQLSO Gold Edition\EWQLSO Gold Library
OR
b) 32 bit
C:\Program Files\East West\EWQLSO Gold Edition\EWQLSO Gold Library

and call it ""Multis""

then you can save and load from there

eg. C:\Program Files (x86)\East West\EWQLSO Gold Edition\EWQLSO Gold Library\Multis\

,anonnamon,2011-05-28T01:40Z,"For you Mac users, try this:

1) Get and install Kontakt 4.1.1 (you know what to do)
2) Mount the ISOs
3) Open/mount the first ISO
4) Copy the /EWQLSO Gold Library/ to your HDD
5) Open/mount the second ISO, then copy its contents INTO the /EWQLSO Gold Library/ folder on your HDD. 
6) Do the same with the other ISOs. The contents should then show eight .NKS files and one /Instruments/ folder.
7) Run Kontakt and go to the Libraries tab, hit Browse and navigate to your /EWQLSO Gold Library/ folder. Once it's added, check out the /Instruments/ folder in Kontakt and see if you can load any of the instruments.
7) Your DAW should now be able to access the instruments via Kontakt."

this program is ""OK"" - its old (2003) and some of the sounds are poor IMO, noise can be heard on some sounds like concert flute, that sounds like its synthesized not sampled...also all strings have some form of noise you can just hear over the top also can hear the musicians moving the instrument away when finished playing the note...

overall its good but if there is a new a copy of the new one I would go for that"
