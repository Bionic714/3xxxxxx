Please find the true which is the bible or your future is doomed. Islam is the curse upon the earth which the bible talks about. 

Bye may YHVH find understanding and kindness in your heart and may you all you muslims find JEsus.

Both Jesus, Son of Man and Muhammad, peace and blessing be upon him, explained that he or she that does good with their time and energy in this life on earth, is blessed with peace, prosperity, love and wisdom. 

I am sad that brothers do not recognize each other. 
I am sad we judge too quickly even to consider why we judge.
I am sad when we choose hate instead of love.

Listen you full of hate!
Hate is the mask of fear!
You are fearful!
The splendour of unfolding Creation has confused you, 
for you understand it not.

You close your eyes and see not that religions are but different expressions of the One truth.

Don't you understand that hate is darkness and love is the light.

,rockstar11998,2008-03-12T04:02Z,"babba00 - you are the one with problems.  Firehawk has been informed like myself.  You Muslims need to see the video Undercover Mosque.  Oh wait its probably something you already knew but you're just pretending to be peaceful because that's how a lot of two-faced hypocritical Muslims are.  

sayswho, alninja, and EyeZxONxU - I'm talking to you.  You need to be more informed rather than telling us we need to be.  We probably know more about your religion's history than you do."
,rockstar11998,2008-03-26T20:47Z,"alninja - Muhammad doesn't even come close to being called a prophet - unless he falls into the category of False Prophet.  Jesus Christ foretold there would be many of those.  Then along came Islam - who knew! LOL  To say that Jesus Christ was anything but Divine is to speak for the Devil because his whole goal was to discredit or diminish who Christ is.  Take for instance the slaughter of every child age 2 and under ordered by Herod.  Did Muhammad have this sort of opposition or raise anyone from the dead?  Was ever foretold to come to earth and save everyone from sin or is Muhammad foretold to come again to earth in power and glory?  Did Muhammad suffer for the sins of all mankind past, present, and future?  Trying to compare the two is like comparing a spec of dust to the galaxy.  One is far more significant."
,rockstar11998,2008-04-11T01:00Z,"I am a good sport about Islam all in all.  I just watched a video called ""Islam: The Light Illuminating the World"".  It was a great portrayal of what good Islam has brought to the world and how advanced a culture can get when it is founded on good principles.  They do claim tho that it was the most advanced culture on earth at the time.  That is either an uninformed statement or a deceitful one.  Has anyone ever heard of the Incas and Mayans??  I sure have, and guess what they were equally advanced if not more so.  So if they weren't Muslims what were they and where did their light and understanding come from?  I can tell you but you'd need an open mind.  They had calculated astronomical and scientific things that would make your head spin.  They even conducted brain surgery.  That's pretty darn advanced I'd say.  Well, I know of a book of scripture that explains how this can be but you may not like to hear its source(hint it's not Satan).
I forgot to tell you where I saw this video.  It was from y o u t u b e.  It was labeled fitna - the movie or something like that tho.  It was in 5 parts. I just looked again after watching it and there is the correctly labeled version there too.  I find this video great at telling the peaceful times and tolerant times but never does it quote any of the negative passages of the Koran or tell the mean things they did.  I guess it wouldn't go along with their wonderful title."
,Serkone,2008-05-17T17:37Z,"Indeed, i hate when people talk without knowing anything. Dont talk crap about islam if u dont know anything about it. Media is bullshit, 90% of the information u get from there is bullshit.

I have nothing against christians but ive seen many of them wearing a cross around their neck and still going around and doing sins like beating, killing, ppl and so on. i mean damn is that normal?

When i ask ppl who use a cross around their neck if their religious here in sweden they say "" No im atheist , i just use it cuz it looks good "" hmmmm..... =|

Not all self bombers are terrorists. read more about that. ask the right ppl and u will learn why they do it. in fact i can say it now, if u live in a country like that and some west pricks come to ur country and starts killing inocent people for fun and for some oil ink ur whole family but u. How the hell would u react? stand in a corner and do nothing while they kill ur son, brother, mother and so on? ofc u would do anything in ur power to stop these men from killing more of ur brothers and sisters. abviously u cant just run in with a AK cuz skilled marines would popp u in a sec. so u get a bomb and sneak into a whole squad of marines and blow them up. so u get ur revenge and save ur country at the same time.

So i would say no-one in the east in this situation is terrorist but the americans.  

See the movie "" Redacted "" so u can see how terrorist they are. ty and bb peace be with u all."
,EVReddy,2008-05-25T19:42Z,"Rockstar11998, you crack me up! How little you know about Islam is obvious in your opinions. It is prudent to be silent on such issues rather than publicly expose your ignorance. No Muslim would discredit or diminish the worth of Jesus. Esa (Jesus) is a prophet of Islam as is Adam, Noah, Jonah, Lot, Abraham, Moses, David, Solomon, Muhammed and others. Islam refers to him as ?Esa Ruhullah? (Esa is the Spirit of Allah, since Allah ?blew? his spirit into Mary?s womb and WILLED the creation of Jesus). Jesus was created within the flesh of Woman alone! Adam was created from naught! Allah says, ?It is easy for me. When I will for a thing to be, I command BE, and IT IS!? There is more mention of Jesus and Mary in the Koran than of Mohammed! So be warned, do not blaspheme and anger our Creator with falsities. Every miracle that Jesus (and other prophets) performed was by invoking God?s Holy Names.  Other prophets and apostles before and after Jesus were also involved in calling God to raise the dead. Elijah did it...Elisha did it...Peter did it...and Paul did it too. Read I Kings 17:17-24 e (Elijah raises the widow's son ), II Kings 4:32-37 (Elisha raises the Shunammite's child), II Kings 13:21 (The dead man restored to life as he touches Elisha's dead bones). Acts 9:36-41 (Peter raises Dorcas). Acts 20:9-12 (Paul raises Eutychus to life). God chooses whoever He wants to perform His miracles: It is easy for Him! Now, to address your other assertions: Christ suffering for the sins of all mankind past, present, and future! That?s the biggest cop out ever! Satan wants you to believe that crock of lies because he wants us to continue sinning (because we think Jesus will take the rap). Get real, Dude! We?re all accountable for our own misdeeds! Otherwise, there would not be a JUDGMENT Day but an Awards Ceremony! And Jesus would be the only guy to roast in Hell since he got a bum rap! Jesus never died. God says in the Koran, ?Every living soul shall taste death?. Yes, Jesus will return and rule for 40 years, then DIE. And then, my friend, will come time for our sphincters to loosen as the Promised Hour will have come. You cannot compare Mohammed to Jesus or any other prophet. Each had his own Divine mission. All prophets were God?s messengers to their own people. Mohammed was a messenger for all mankind. Rockstar, you talk about having an open mind, but just how knowledgeable are you about the Koran, Islam, Mohammed besides the inflammatory lies one picks up in bars? How knowledgeable are you about your own Christian theology to enter into an intelligent, impartial, objective debate on the subject? Look within yourself and answer that question truthfully and to yourself. Peace."
,rockstar11998,2008-05-30T07:22Z,"InTheCrack - The following countries deserved to be bombed by the US for murdering and killing innocent people within their own country - Laos, Cambodia, Sudan, Afghanistan, Iraq, Panama, Grenada, Korea, China, Guatemala, Cuba, Indonesia, Congo, Peru, El Salvador, Libya, Nicaragua, and Yugoslavia. You asked what is terrorism? It is leading your people by fear rather than basing the government on freedom and democracy. LOL retard."
,rockstar11998,2008-05-30T07:55Z,"EVReddy - I'm glad I amuse you.  Fools mock but they shall mourn.  I may not know as much about Islam as you but I bet I know more about the true Islam than you do.  I've watched both videos that are for Islam and those that are against it.  I bet you can't say the same.  I know enough of the truth to know it can't possibly be the right religion.  Also I know the history well enough to know it's growth happened because of war and compulsion not missionary work.  Missionary work is how God spread His word and always has.  Muhammad isn't a a true prophet of God.  He is a prophet of Satan telling lies and false doctrine.  Satan used him just like he used Hitler to bring hate, misery, death, war, and pain, all around the world.  The true Islam is showing its ugly head once again.
Thanks for sharing with me some nonsense from the Koran about Jesus Christ.  The Koran's (I mean Satan's opinions) about Christ are nothing compared to the Holy Scriptures ( The Holy Bible, The Doctrine and Covenants, The Pearl of Great Price, and The Book of Mormon).  Not to mention the words of modern day prophets.  Today the true church/religion of God is led by Thomas S. Monson - Prophet, Seer, and Revelator.   I can clearly see the lies and perversions of Christianity and Judaism found in the Koran.  It is just a tool of the devil to deceive so many of God's children.
Now you make a comment about sin.  I know from prophets and scripture that Jesus suffered for the sins of the whole world past, present and future.  This does not mean once you accept him as your Savior through the ordinance of Baptism and the receive the Gift of the Holy Ghost your done sinning.  That is a lie spoken of in many messed up Born Again Christian Doctrine not mine.  I know we keep sinning and need to keep repenting.  True repentance comes when you no longer have a desire to repeat those sins you repent of.  The goal is perfection just like Jesus Christ was perfect.  He is no mere prophet.  He was the only perfect man.  Therefore he could be the perfect sacrifice for sins because of the demands of justice.  Without him how can we repay our sins to God??  We must be washed clean with his blood.  That is what the Law of Moses was all about.  Christ is the Lamb of God.  It's too bad so many Muslims don't understand that point and will not have true repentance until he comes again or until they reach the spirit world.  You say that Jesus will take the ""rap"" for us right.  If he didn't we could never be cleansed from sin and therefore never return to God's presence.  No unclean thing can dwell with God.  You can try to debate the issue with me over and over but you'll get no where.  I teach this stuff and know way more than you do or will know (if you choose not to change your ways) about God and how His plan works for His children.  I never said we aren't accountable for our own deeds.  That's where the suffering part comes into play.  All of the sins we don't truly repent of in this life will need to be payed for in the next life in the Spirit World before Judgment Day after the Millenium.  Jesus Christ already paid for the sins of all mankind, therefore he can set the conditions of forgiveness.  He said we should keep the commandments, repent (ask for forgiveness and strive to change our ways and right any wrongs), be baptized, receive the Gift of the Holy Ghost, join his church, heed the words of the prophets, read the scriptures, and endure to the end.  Of course there are many other ordinances required for salvation but I'll leave that for another discussion.
OK another topic your religion is messed up on is the resurrection.  The resurrection is where the body and the Spirit are reunited forever - this is called immortality.  This is a free gift to all men where our bodies will be perfected.  Christ was the first to be resurrected and many others followed him.  He and they will NEVER die again.  There will be different stages of resurrection for the rest of us according to how we lived our lives and how fast we are able to repent in this life or t"
,rockstar11998,2008-05-30T08:03Z,Serkone - Here you go again with your dribble.  I know way more than you'd like to give me credit for.  I already responded t these comments at another place.  When I get the time I'll copy them over here.
,rockstar11998,2008-05-30T17:23Z,"EVReddy - I forgot to make another comment about Muhammad.  In doing some of my research about Islam I learned that before Muhammad could give any of his new recitations he would go into convulsions kind of like an epileptic episode.  If that doesn't sound like someone who is being possessed by the devil or an evil spirit then I don't know what does.  Many of the fortune tellers, psychics, soothsayers, diviners, and those who see into the future are using the aide of Satan not God.  Satan knows how to predict future events and is able to possess people who let him.  Remember Jesus and his Apostles cast out many evil spirits back in that day.  I know you'll not understand what I'm talking about because of your lack of understanding in spiritual matters but this is for all of those that aren't informed enough about Islam and the false prophet Muhammad."
,palipol,2008-06-15T18:03Z,"TrueBelieverFireHawk- you don't know what the f+ck you are talking about.Fcking ignorant that's what you are.People like you cause the mess on earth...you are more fanatic than those fcking people who fight in ""the name of Islam"" Islam means peace stupid fck..have you ever been in a country where islam is the primary faith??You make me sick...what about the child molesters from the vatican..yeah you don't know about them do you??Do a little search before you open your mouth!!"
,rockstar11998,2008-06-16T17:52Z,"palipol - are you a terrorist sympathizer as well? I agree with most of what TrueBelieverFireHawk has said.  Islam is evil not peaceful.  If you knew anything about the history of Islam you'd know it was forced on millions of people not preached peacefully.  In the past 40 years Islam has done more damage to the world than all of the natural disasters.  Sure most of the Muslims today practice a peaceful form of Islam.  But the Koran does give the Extremists justification for killing others and causing 9/11.  Because the peaceful Muslims are too scared to fight against the extremists this minority will soon become the majority. If you would watch 'Obsession' and 'Undercover Mosque' you'd understand why we are so opposed to Islam as a whole.
You asked if he's ever been in a country where Islam is the primary religion.  I bet he's too scared to.  I know I would be.  Because I'd want to teach the truth and I'd probably be killed for it.  I don't know the true history of Muhammad whether he was a child molester or not but certainly some radical mosques are teaching it is ok to marry girls before they reach the age of puberty.  Sounds pretty evil to me.  Yes indeed the Catholic church many issues with child molestation as well.  They have been trying to cover it up for years.  That's what happens when you try to teach that celibacy is of God.  It has never been a doctrine I've believed in nor does the Bible teach this.  The Bible teaches that Marriage between a man and a woman is ordained of God.  That is the only way that each can be exalted in the Kingdom of God as in celestial glory.  Neither is the woman without the man nor the man without the woman in the Lord.  So its obvious how false the doctrines of the Catholic church are.  They have changed their doctrines and practices so much and their history is so corrupt I don't know how anyone could still belong to that church except through ignorance.  If anyone is Catholic who reads this they need to keep seeking for the truth and study the Bible.  Think for yourself and diligently seek to learn the will of God.  If you do this humbly I know you will be led to the one true church of God."
,rockstar11998,2008-06-21T17:35Z,"EVReddy - I have a few more thoughts for you.  I reread today some scriptures which point out how unimportant it is for me to sound knowledgeable and very educated (yet I am) about Islam to know how wrong it is.  Also the scripture I'm referring too points out how only spiritual things can be discerned or understood by spiritual beings.  The following text is from 1 Corinthians chapter 2 : bodthdog - aka Korihor - aka Antichrist -  Even tho I know this guy is gone I have some final thoughts for those that are anti-religions like thisguy and can't comprehend spiritual things.  I have been repeating the thought that only spiritual knowledge can come from a spiritual person.  I recently reread 1 Corinthians chapter 2 and it clearly lays this out. Here is the text:
1And I, brethren, when I came to you, came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom, declaring unto you the testimony of God.
2For I determined not to know any thing among you, save Jesus Christ, and him crucified.
3 And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling.
4 And my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power:
5 That your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.
6 Howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect: yet not the wisdom of this world, nor of the princes of this world, that come to nought:
7 But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom, which God ordained before the world unto our glory:
8 Which none of the princes of this world knew: for had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.
9 But as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him.
Isa 64:4
10 But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God.
11 For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him? even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God.
12 Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God.
13 Which things also we speak, not in the words which man's wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth; comparing spiritual things with spiritual.
14 But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.
15 But he that is spiritual judgeth all things, yet he himself is judged of no man.
16 For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct him? But we have the mind of Christ."

,rockstar11998,2008-07-25T19:08Z,"xanderxine - I am right behind you on the Catholics being the problem giving True Christianity a bad rap.  You need to watch a few videos by Walter Veith to know why the Catholic church is so evil.  I Suggest you watch his videos entitled, A Woman rides the Beast, Two Beasts become Friends, Secret of the Secret Societies, The Battle of the Giants, The Islamic Connection, Crimes of the Antichrist, and Revolutions, Dictators and Wars.  Basically if you watch his whole series for Amazing Discoveries called Total Onslaught you'll be very informed about the evil out in the world.  I am totally blown away by all of this information but I am not surprised either from what I already knew.  Everyone needs to know this information to be prepared for what is ahead."

And the one, that they have the greatest respect for, is the one god, that they believe in. Don't you understand that a true believer could kill you for saying that, and all muslims would stand behind him, because there is no worse things that a man can say, than what you just did.
