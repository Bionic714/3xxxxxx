It was directed by the syrian geniusy Mostafa Al Akkad, who also directed the story of (Omar Al Mokhtar) and (Halloween) movie series.

The Message tells the story of the very begining of Islam. The days of Mecca, Medina, the battles of early muslims against the unfaithful and how they tried to deliver the message to the outer world. It shows the struggle of the new faithful inside their very souls and outside in their refusing community.

I hope it gives some idea about the real Islam, the one that differs totally from what we see every now and then by muslim hands.

Peace be with you

Tip: I will try to provide arabic subtitles later. See the underlying comments.
