DMG DVD Image. Use Disk Utility to burn to DVD. When installing it will eject the DVD and ask for disk 2 just put the same DVD back in and you will be good to go. You will need to BURN the DMG to DVD to actually play the game. This is a security feature. If you can find a way to bypass that then you dont need to burn the DVD.
