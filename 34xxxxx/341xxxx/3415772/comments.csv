,BioTube,2009-07-01T22:08Z,"The voice acting was, to me, the best part of the video; the animation's subpar(although the drawing's pretty high quality). The sex doesn't start until ~10 minutes in and the first two scenes are extremely tame(innocent girl gives head to some guy whose face is never shown, perverted girl eats innocent girl's cunt); ~20 minutes in is a pissing scene on a subway car, at which point I stopped watching; if you're into that kind of thing, this is decent jackoff material."
