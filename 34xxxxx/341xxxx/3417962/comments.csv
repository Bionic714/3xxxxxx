Kanske?"
,Bluesoul,2006-01-23T19:37Z,"Sorry Stylewalker don't have Woyzeck (yet), but if and when I get it I'll upload it ;)"

,Dr Zorn,2006-04-27T13:39Z,"I'm using VLC. I can hear the badly dubbed Spanish audio track, and the badly dubbed English audio track, but no German. There is no option for the German. What's up?"
,Bluesoul,2006-05-09T13:59Z,Fitzcarraldo was originally filmed in English and then dubbed in to German. The reason it was originally made in English was that this was the most common language between the cast & crew members. 
,Luckz,2006-05-27T01:43Z,"He was asking why the Spanish and English audio track are present while the German one is not, Bluesoul."
,Bluesoul,2006-07-21T11:32Z,"Because there is NO german audio track!! How many times do i have to repeat myself, no wonder i stopped UL here, just a bunch of...."
,tony_olsson,2006-07-28T05:48Z,"Talade språk: Engelska, Tyska, Spanska "
,Bluesoul,2006-08-09T08:33Z,"NO, Talade språk only Engleska and Spanska, PRIMARY and SECONDARY audio. No german. Its a dual audio dvdrip, the german thing is a MISTAKE...."
,notdondelillo,2007-01-13T16:58Z,"but how can you turn off the spanish audio, so you only hear the english?"
,Bluesoul,2007-02-18T10:54Z,"You simply switch between the audio streams (1 & 2), depending on what software you use for playing it. You must find the audio option in your media player you use to choose which audio will be used, that's all. "
,Bluesoul,2007-02-18T11:05Z,"For Bsplayer: rightclick, Audio option, Audio Stream, Stream 2 (for English, 1 for Spanish)

For VLC player: Audio menu, Audio Track (2 for English,  1 for Spanish) I cant explain it more simple then that..."
,Slakpad,2007-07-25T13:39Z,"If i burn it on dvd, how can i make sure only the english audio will play?"
,gva71,2007-08-30T10:29Z,"Good image and sound quality, thanx for the upload"

,ajobeus,2007-10-30T13:30Z,"I´ve tried to change the spoken langauge of this film in my Windows Mediaplayer 11 (from Spanish to English) but I haven´t managed.  Does anybody have good advice?
Thanks/

,simba7777,2007-11-23T14:17Z,"Don't use Windows media player, they are very limited in their capabilities.
Use a good small player like KMPlayer, it can play anything and do anything. You can DL it from here:

Don't forget to switch off the normalizer audio effect..."

,j0kerman,2009-04-19T19:32Z,"Download a program called virtualdubmod - open the first video file (click ""no"" to the 2 boxes that appear) - go to ""streams"" then ""stream list"" - you should see 2 audio streams - click stream 1 and then ""disable"" to disable the Spanish auido (or stream 2 to disable the English). Click ""OK"" then under File ""save as"" and give a new filename. Do the same for the second video file."
,stinki,2009-04-22T16:05Z,"VLC player is also a great player that allows selecting of different audio tracks, and tends to handle videos better than media player in general.

The 2nd audio track is English, the language the movie was filmed in, but the English subtitles are really sloppy, often off."
,popeye5,2009-06-16T04:38Z,"Bluesoul,...  Thanks for the upload, BUT You gotta help me.  I want to burn this to DVD to watch on the TV.  I want the English audio only.  How can I get this done???  PLEASE!  Step by step!

Thanks much
"
,annalator,2009-07-01T21:44Z,"to Bluesoul:

the reasonn people think that there was german audio might be that in ""spoken language(s)"" you also have ""German""."
,kunminger,2010-02-14T20:44Z,GReat movies Bluesoul.. Please don't let the morons deter you from uploading.. wish there was a dedicated world cinema torrent sire
