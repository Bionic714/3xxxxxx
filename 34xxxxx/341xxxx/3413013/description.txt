***XBOX - Morrowind GOTY Ultimate Mod Library v1.0***
----------------------------------------------------

Here it is folks, my attempt to bring all of the 
Morrowind mods together in one pack,

This pack contains all of the content from 

Johnny-Evil.com, 
Frezzo's Beginners Mod Pack, 
Frezzo's Mod Pack 2 & 3 
BadBoy_AC's Weapons and Armor packs 1 & 2

As well as a couple of other mods I've picked up.


***********************Noob Installation*****************************

Make sure you replace default.xbe and morrowind.xbe with Frezzno's 
hacked versions, or your mods wont run.

Open The Data file inside Morrowind on you Xbox or Pc
(eg, f:/Games/Morrowind/Data Files)

Drop the esm file of the mod u want into Data files and your done !

If you have 3 folders with the mod (Textures, Meshes and Icons)
then stick them in data file as well, if youve already got these three other folders in 
there from previous mods, then just add the stuff out of your latest mod folders into those, its that easy.

Do's
 
   Always read the readme's (But ignore the pc bits) some mods may not run with others,
   or require another mod running concurrently. Two mods so far (ultimate galleon and he latest greatest housing mod gold) 
   may stop certain parts of the games script from appearing so you can't continue the main story. 
   This is rare but the Galleon is great for when you have completed the main Quest.

   ALways clear your cache and x,y,z drives when installing a new mod

Dont's

   Try to run too many mods at once (Your Xbox only has limited memory remember)
   Getting giddy with too many mods, especially places to visit, will result in your humble box running out of
   memory and the game crashing, a lot of time has been spent by others to reduce texture size
   thus lowering memory usage but its not really known how many mods you can run safetly, and you can always remove any if 
   you get problems, just delete the .esm

\\\Acknowledgements///////

All the hard work on these things was done by the original creators then 
many hours have been spent by Johnny-Evil, BadBoy_AC and Frezzno and others resizing 
textures etc so you could enjoy these mods on your xbox. Without them, Morrowind would be a far duller place.

All original Readme's are included.





FiNALLY ---- I am always looking for new mods to add to the library, so if you have a mod you have created or resized for
	     the Xbox and you would like to share it with other Morrowind addicts, why not
	     send it to me at: 
				Xbox-Morrowind-Mods@hotmail.com
	
	   Please also send any feedback to that address, or the name of any site you know with quality Xbox Morrwind Mods.
