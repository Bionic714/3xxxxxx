Album review from ARTIST direct site:

The opening "Om" is a 12-minute mini-lecture from Watts that provided a decidedly Western approach to many of the basic concepts and precepts of Hinduism.

The following cut is the ten-minute "Tambouras for Meditation." The hypnotic drone as well as the even tempo and pace provide a languid and somewhat ethereal experience for the listener in addition to its meditative usefulness.

The final piece provides a quarter hour of "Readings from Hindu Scriptures," which are again accompanied by the tamboura and tabla.
