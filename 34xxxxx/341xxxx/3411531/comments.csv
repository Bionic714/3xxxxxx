,Kissy1965,2008-04-24T13:55Z,"Hello I'm new to torrents but I'm loving them. Lassie is my all time favorite and I'd really like to get this one. I've also been stuck at 99.9% for about 2 days. I've found that the movie will play on VLC media player as it is. My problem is that I want to burn it to dvd so my grandaughter can see it as my son doesn't have a computer. So please will someone seed the last .01% Thank you
Kissy"
