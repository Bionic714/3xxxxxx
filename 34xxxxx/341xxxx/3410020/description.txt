Notes 
A wonderful performance from the Bookends period, full of energy and good humour. The performance was recorded by Al Kooper, and was likely intended for an official live album. A few recording anomalies (the guitar hitting Paul's mic stand and tape saturation) likely commanded a veto from the CBS Records executives. It's a shame, because, aside from a few recording baubles, the show is certainly worth an official release. Of special note are the performances of "Overs," "At The Zoo," "Leaves That Are Green," "The Dangling Conversation," and "Old Friends / Bookends."
