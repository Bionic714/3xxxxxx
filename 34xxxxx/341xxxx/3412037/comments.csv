,KaptnK,2006-10-18T23:44Z,can we get a reseed?
,drwingnut,2007-02-07T20:57Z,Re-seed please!
,moracca,2007-03-19T02:51Z,"Sorry everyone, but my computer has crashed, and I lost the original files.  I will get the CD again and re-up another torrent shortly.  Sorry bout that!"
,deanimate,2007-10-09T11:03Z,"Hallo :) Is there any chance you could re-seed this again please? Have been looking round for ages for the soundtrack to this brilliant film.
I would buy it if the price wasn't so overinflated :(

Will of course help seed this for ages :o)"
,deanimate,2007-10-09T11:52Z,"Hmm, sweet! :D
still be cool if this could be seeded again in case this link goes down but i managed to find it here.

Works fine for me so worth a go :)"
,aleroit,2008-08-13T04:36Z,"Dear Moracca: what in heaven should we do to help you, in order for you to reseed this soundtrack? Please?... It's so hard to find it. Txs in advance! Deanimate's link doesn't work anymore."
,moracca,2008-10-30T00:36Z,"Hey everyone, sorry it took so long to get another copy of this.  I had originally given the cd as a gift to someone who i am no longer in contact with (its a very hard CD to find, it cost about $80 on ebay).  I was able to get a copy from the link posted by deanimate (THANK YOU!).  I've recreated a torrent here:

enjoy!"
