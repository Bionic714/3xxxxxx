,Doh-mer,2006-07-10T00:21Z,"I installed the game... but while I tried to launch the game, it kept asking for CD2, allthough I emulated it with daemon tools. Would it help if I really burnt it to a CD?"

I have a silly question for you all. I was able to dowload the files but I am not able to play the game since my PC doesnÂ´t recognize the program. I am guessing I need a some kind of program but donÂ´t know which one. Help, please??
thank you!!!"
