 Dont install DIGI drivers in ProTools 6.7 LE installer.
 Choose personal installation and uncheck DIGI DRIVERS.

 ProTools M-powered works ONLY WITH
 M-AUDIO CARDS!!!"

,RubenH,2006-02-02T00:12Z,"i have an ozone too, i thought it did support it!
Thats what it said on the website --- www. m-audio.com"
,Bildernell,2006-02-02T01:11Z,Ozone is newly supported by v.7 and not by this one(v.6.7). So if anybody's got Pro Tools M-Powered 7 plz upload!

,Spocken 81,2006-02-14T22:27Z,Well... I have m-powered 7... but I've tried to follow the crack instructions and just install m-powered 7 instead of 6.8... but that doesn't work...
,Bildernell,2006-02-17T17:06Z,Where did you get M-Powered 7? I'd like to try to get it working.
,Spocken 81,2006-02-23T04:11Z,I got from m-audios hompage... it's an update... you have to fill in a form though... http://www.m-audio.com/?do=products.demo&demo_ID=ptmp7pc&form=1
,Piratox2000,2006-03-12T19:16Z,"Read crack manual!

 Do you need to:
1. install m-powered 
2. remove digi folder in m-powered version
3. install ProTools Le without digi drivers
4. unpack crack files (as crack info)
5. Run ProTools Le use SERIAL (close APPZ)
6 Unpack last crack files ... DONE

 ProTools Le runs over M-Powered"

,blaze7,2006-05-18T13:47Z,"It does work, but you have to read the instructions, yes read.  You also need to know the installation path. If you still don't get it, try again but this time think about what you are doing and ask yourself ""do I have 733t skillz"". If not try again when you do. "

If anyone has this version up and running can you post specifically what Sound Card / Interface you are using and if your're on Desktop or Laptop.

,Dan8859,2006-07-06T16:45Z,"This crack works ok, but it definitely used up more CPU than it should when running the program. Is there a crack out there for just the m-powered version? The demo of this definitely runs faster for m-audio hardware."

,blouis,2006-12-07T16:36Z,"patrickryan12> try again without installing any drivers throughout the installation, just the pro tools software. work for me with my 2496 card.

but it's really true that this installation uses way to much CPU... it's more or less useless.
a patch for the m-powered 7.3 demo or something like that would really be great. anyone?"
,zoltan_jeff,2007-01-10T17:24Z,"Okej..jag har laddat ner den nu, men den säger ""Unable to locate Digidesign hardware""...Måste jag köpa något för att få detta att fungera eller? Isåfall vad? 
""Vi är ett flertal gubbar som är tacksamma för svar!!!""
Okay...I have downloaded this tirrent now, but it says ""Unable to locate Digidesign hardware""... Do i have to buy something to get this program to work? IF it is so, what should i buy?
""we are a few people that are very thankfull for all the answers thats coming in""

Tack på förhand!"
,guitarist1,2007-01-21T16:45Z,Installing ProTools like this has to be done with a certain sequence I've found. I usually clone/image the XP install first then try at it. Be sure to install Quicktime before Pro Tools. It's been a while so I can't remember the whole recipe. Perhaps someone else can offer their steps to help out and maybe this still works with 7.3. 
,cxwxb777,2007-01-23T09:31Z,"Here we go, full instruction XP(SP2) installation and crack:
1) Get ProTools 6.7 LE or TDM with valid serial number (which can't be found on the net)
2) Make sure you have installed supported M-audio card with latest driver
3) Install PT LE 6.7 (do not install any DIGI hardware drivers)
4) Reboot
5) Delete \Pro Tools folder from installed directory windows will warn you, click OK to delete
6) Reboot


Ok soon as you delete that folder ""ProToolsLE.exe"" Is gone also


8) Extract files and overwrite them from ""step 8.rar"" to C:\Program Files\Digidesign\Pro Tools\

If you delete the folder there is nothing to Over ride HELLO!!!!


9) Open ProToolsLE.exe 


Can't open a file that anit there!!!!!!!

10) Enter serial number then close protools
11) Extract files from ""step 11.rar"" to C:\Program Files\Digidesign\Pro Tools\
12) That's it.



So none Of this will work Some one care to rewrite this with the rite info on how this would be doen right"
,j_hindsight,2007-04-21T13:36Z,"If you're still getting the hardware prompt or other problems then (like me) your audio card is not compatible with m-powered 6.8 or you haven't installed the latest drivers for your sound card. 

Can anyone work out how to get this to work for m-powered 7 audio cards? You can download the free demo from digi design website. Surely it's a similar process? I've had a go messing with drivers and the like but no joy. "
,captinbirdseye,2007-05-01T19:13Z,"FIRSTLY: THE INSTRUCTIONS HERE ARE TOTALLY FUCKED , WHY the damn can't anyone answer a question properly and clearly or AT LEAST SAY IF THIS TORRENT WORKS OR NOT..???????????????!!!!!"
,chepurko,2007-07-20T10:16Z,"I would like to know what sound card works with this version of M-Powered.  When I get the ""No Digidesign Hardware detected message"" is the M-Audio sound card installation what fixes that?  Because I though Pro Tools LE needs Rack or MBox installed.


DOES THIS WORK????"
,XweAponX,2007-08-04T21:48Z,"""Get ProTools 6.7 LE or TDM with valid serial number (which can't be found on the net)""

Yes you can... Just search for PT LE version 6 serial numbers in Google and use all of your antivirus programs on full blast when you search through the links.

I found a place that has about 4 PT s/n's (Working) - But I also got the... Ah I forget what virus it was, it attached to IE and you could not delete the DLL files until you took that HD off the system. I used a Vista install DVD to do that.

However, I used that serial number on the DIGI site to download PT 6.4 LE for Hide when Minimised.  In the Process Property Sheet? Go to VIEW>Select columns. Choose These columns:

Process ID (PID number)
CPU Usage
MEMORY usage
USE OBJECTS and USER NAME
and then 
VIRTUAL MEMORY SIZE.

And then keep it active but minimised in the systray. If the programs bogs up? LOOK at your MEM usage and VM Size and CPU usage. If you CPU usage is perpetually at 100% then it is a PC problem or yer OS is fuckin corrupted.

Remember yer using the PC to RECORD, so ya don;t fuckin need Windows Live Anything, Messenger, Security Center... Even FUCKING Norton/Symantshit/McAfeewaste. Use NOD32 for fuckin monitoring active processes.

Sorry for the fukkin long TOME"
,XweAponX,2007-08-04T21:58Z,"DUCKFUCK!

the fucker chopped up my post!

""However, I used that serial number on the DIGI site to download PT 6.4 LE'

I meant to say, I used the SN I found to download PT 6.4 from the DIGI Archives. It actually worked, so as you see why I am less than eager to give you the number I found myself. But if you use GOOGLE you can find it if you use intelligent fuckin searching and protect yerself especially if you have to go to crackspider.ms. Usually, MS Defender and the PooP-Up blocker will prevent you from getting the damn VUNDO virus which is what I got.

regarding the rest of it... With a DIGI you ought not to have ANY memory fucking sucking problems. If you do, then your PC has a lotta trouble. right klik next to yer clock in the systray and open yer TASK MANAGER. Set it up like this:

Go to the Processes property sheeit. Go To OPTIONS>Hide when Minimised. In the Process Property Sheet Go to VIEW>Select columns. Choose These columns:

Process ID (PID number)
CPU Usage
MEMORY usage
USE OBJECTS and USER NAME
and then 
VIRTUAL MEMORY SIZE.

And then keep it active but minimised in the systray. If the programs bogs up? LOOK at your MEM usage and VM Size and CPU usage. If you CPU usage is perpetually at 100% then it is a PC problem or yer OS is fuckin corrupted.

Remember yer using the PC to RECORD, so ya don't fuckin need Windows Live Anything, Messenger, Security Center... Even FUCKING Norton/Symantshit/McAfeewaste. Use NOD32 for fuckin monitoring active processes.

You can probably use that dang Process Explorer POS plug in for NortShit, but if you use the one that comes with Windows, it uses less resources and is not confusing. Also avoid that SYSTERNALS thing that replaces the Task Manager. Use TASK MANAGER, no substitoots allowed."

,BloodxRaven,2008-11-17T06:06Z,"Actually, M-Audio does not often come with pro tools. Usually, you get ""Session"" which is nice, but not nearly as nice as pro tools. Judging by the comments it looks like this could be a lot of trouble, so I'll comment back once I got it to work with how I did it."

,d0nkeyz,2012-04-01T00:56Z,I let you all know that the torrent of this protools 6 isn't working. It still require the hardware which is m-audio hardware card or adapter like M-box. This is an installer with a crack but it's worth of nothing if you don't own the M-box shit (costs 450$$$$).
