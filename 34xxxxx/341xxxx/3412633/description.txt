Someone asked for this tribute video, shown originally on Friday Night Smackdown! on November 18, 2005. I think it's one of the best tribute videos done, and a great way to remember Eddie Guerrero. The song on the video is 'Here Without You' by 3 Doors Down, from their album 'Away From The Sun'.

This was ripped directly from the Internet stream of this video from the WWE website, at 300 Kbps. Hope you all enjoy!

Que descanses siempre en paz, Eddie.
