,chicotree,2006-01-13T03:49Z,everything works thanks for this powerful program!
,RainerF,2006-01-24T14:35Z,"Do you install it over after every 30 days? Or what?
Or is there a keygen for Mac?"
,hoosierillusion,2006-01-28T19:26Z,This does not appear to be a Mac application.  I don't know why it is listed as such.
,igl,2006-02-13T00:30Z,is this MAC or windows now?
,veloce88,2006-03-20T16:55Z,"I can install and run the program fine, but I can't get the Keygen to work.  Whenever I type in my system id, it tells me that it is invalid.  Any thoughts?"
,Lunabomber,2006-03-22T17:52Z,"an I/O error occured while installing a file this is normaly cuased by bad instalation or media or currupt instalation file.  

not sure what this means, it could be my disc is too scrached, or some of the files are currupted, but that could be winrar..uhhgg who knows"
,jess-0427,2006-04-24T02:08Z,How do you open this application? 
,jess-0427,2006-04-24T02:09Z,Is this Mac or PC ?
,gumbius,2006-07-13T05:31Z,"the .exe keygen is confusing. I opened it on a pc and then it said it was ""copied from the clip board"" now use ""paste from clipboard option"".  It doesn't work "
,gumbius,2006-07-13T05:34Z,".exe keygen on pc, then it automatically copies key to registration, which will be on a mac. maybe virtual pc is the answer?"
,gumbius,2006-07-13T05:36Z,"set up a partion, every 20 days reinstall using new partion"
,Hambern,2006-11-20T18:07Z,I Can't get my pirated Logic Express 7.2 to open the Audio Unit from this release. The same thing is true with the FM7 release i've got. Why not? The .component-files are in the exact right folder. anyone that has gotten this to work properly?
,bbf43,2006-12-15T23:39Z,"hossierillusion is right, after mounting the disc image, you're presentented with an .exe file. 
thus, it ain't Mac."
,godemiche,2006-12-23T16:51Z,"This torrent it's ok for Mac! The only thing that doesn't work in the Mac OS is the Keygen.exe
Simple! If you don't have a pc you have to install Virtual Pc or Parallels to run the keygen.exe. on yr Mac. Just run the keygen. Insert the system id than click on generate. When it says that the generated number is in the clipboard just open a wordpad, then mouse right click, select paste. This brings the number out of the clipboard. Save the file and bring it to the mac by email or flash pen, etc (or old fashion way write it on paper). The next thing you have to do on the mac is open the text file or type on the number on a a text file with no spaces, select it to make copy. This put the number on the clipboard. Next, on Reaktor registration tool click on the button that says paste from the clipboard.
The number apears on the 12 blank spaces. It works fine with me. "
,popebuggix,2007-01-02T07:51Z,"Does anyone have install instructions for this? It's got the files, but there's no installer to speak of. Everything's useless if it can't be installed..."
,DJdu1020,2007-01-24T16:34Z,"This is not a Mac version ( PPC or x86)
If it is, prove it please. "
,maetherlinck,2007-01-26T18:35Z,"I know how use the keygen, but how do I do to install the program? There is no .dmg-file or install file!

Just .bin , .sfv , .cue , .nfo
what program do I use to extract the installer?"
,Gothma,2007-02-11T10:41Z,"To any doubters, Yes this is a MAC program, Yes it works perfectly, Yes you do have to run the keygen on a PC however.

This really does work.

Oh and
Yes this can be used as a VSTI if you wish."

Exact same problem here, well, with Reaktor, not with FM7.  

Anyone has any ideas?  Maybe you need an updated reaktor for logic to accept the AU?  Really fustrated, tried forums everywhere and got no info, if you can please help."
,Om-ega,2007-02-23T12:31Z,"the keygen is infected, there's ""W32.Dumadon"" or something like this"

,ambikah,2008-05-14T11:06Z,"okay to all the people who think this is a windows only torrent, i thought so too.. but! when i mounted the image in Toast 7 Titanium, it actually brought up TWO cds, one was the windows version, the other was mac. look closely on your desktop or in your finder for it, it should be there. if you burnt the image or loaded it in the mac disk utility im not sure if itll show up.  but if you have/get toast, here is how to make it work:
  - open toast
  - in the menu bar click on Utilities > Mount Disc Image
  - select dlm-nir5.bin

the windows and mac cds should now BOTH be mounted. if you dont have toast, i highly recommend getting it, itll come in handy in the future. just search for the torrent.

CAN SOMEONE PLEASE GENERATE A NAME/SERIAL FOR ME AND POST IT HERE PLEASE? THANK YOU."

,clegs,2008-06-27T06:14Z,"It works on my PPC G5 With 10.5... with a condition!

haha sometimes when i change presets/do anything really that gives me a yes,no or cancel warning, then whole program freezes apart from the warning box but when you click any of the button it doesn't do anything...

odd! but good enough to get that this program rocks!

pretty straight forward, mount the cd click on the reactor cd (the one with the colorful icon) and it installs, ask your mate with a pc to borrow it for about 10 minutes so you can get 1. a serial from the keygen.exe 2.  the system id which is given from the registration tool...

ok not that easy, haha but just keep trying!"
,clegs,2008-06-27T06:16Z,oh and im using logic 8 ;-)
,wholewheat,2008-07-11T17:23Z,"hey,
im on logic 8, installed everything fine and can open as a standalone. im not able to see it as an AU in logic though, and was wondering if anyone was able to get this?
any help would be greatly appreciated, 

cheers"
,tylerdurdensback,2008-07-26T03:15Z,"Hello, Intel Mac people out there running Leopard.

,maxtampax,2009-08-27T15:49Z,"I downloaded and installed it; looks like a good quality torrent, but I can't find the keygen. Also normally you'd be able to try the program out for 30days, but even that doesn't work; he keeps asking for the authorization key... Could someone plz generate me a key that works? Help is needed; thanks."
,poseidon535,2010-01-14T16:38Z,"1. Use the < reaktor_5_keygen > included in the torrent folder for the serial.

2. After installation, go to < C:\Program Files\Native Instruments\Reaktor 5 > and click on Registration Tool.

3.Copy the System ID and open the < reaktor_5_keygen > again.

4. Now click on the keygen tab and paste the System ID. The Keygen will generate the Authorization Key automatically.

5. Open the Registration Tool once again and click on PASTE FROM CLIPBOARD.

6. Click Authorize. Installation Complete.

Thanks uploader :)

,DubDreams,2011-01-14T21:15Z,The keygen.exe shows up as i download in utorrent but disappears when looking in the containing folder....WTF?!?
,skathe665,2011-08-10T00:44Z,@DubDreams Try making sure an anti-virus program isn't blocking it. You will need to disable your anti-virus if it is and then run the keygen.

,Vayzeee,2012-01-26T00:35Z,"Okie dokie, I got it to work FINALLY. You don't need a keygen to do this anymore. Just follow these steps and you should get past the stupid authorization window. Idk if this will work on Mac's but give it a try!

1) Start the setup.
2) Disconnect from your wireless, if you have a wired connection, it won't affect anything.
3) Type in any name, and copy this link to the serial boxes: 31587-04339-14504-99744-53898
4) After that it should authorize and install!

Good Luck, if you need any help just reply to my comment and I will try to help ya!"
