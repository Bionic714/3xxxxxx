,Hissy,2006-08-08T01:48Z,"Ok I have a problem. I put it on my Hd, had a couple problems, wove through them, but I have one i cant wieve through. I cant get the disk to work, so i cant do the install. I run the cracked version, and it tells me that it has been inproperly installed and that i need to reinstall. I looked at the details and it says that MSVCRT.Dll and MSVCIRT.Dll are in the wrong place. If anyone has a solution, email me, or just comment :P

,Maco99,2006-09-08T14:51Z,"Hi i dl'ed Mecg 4 merc and it installed fine but when i try to play it i get this ""Please Insert the correct CD-ROM, select ok and restart application"" it wont work with cd 1 or 2. i need help"
,Maco99,2006-09-09T23:54Z,"If u cant get it to work, whenu record the iso to a disk put it into your Cd drive nd explore it, find crack copy it and past it into the mech folder in your comp took me a whileto figure it out"
,RJdeWit,2007-03-22T16:38Z,Are you sure nobody can divide this torrent into 3 seperate files? I already played the Warriors back and forth but I just want Commander. Can anybody please do that? 
,Oma_trekkie,2007-04-13T04:40Z,To what maco99 wrote: if you're using daemon-tools there is the option to emulate safedisc or securom - this will help. Though bear in mind that Mechwarrior 4 takes an annoyingly long time to start up (at least for me) and asks for settings and approval of the EULA every f*cking time! 
,leafblighter,2007-05-28T04:22Z,"I've installed the Mech Warrior 4 including the crack files, but it wont start and I keep receiving this message    STOP      : Cannot find VideoCard.txt

,zoobezee,2008-06-03T14:59Z,"....um, I was reading the commets, but couldn't find a definate answer.
How exactly do you 'play' these games?
You need an ISO burner program to put it on a CD right?
(I'm trying MW3)"
,deathnote2008,2008-08-24T16:17Z,I was looking for this game and I love it please seed...

Thanks!!

,bdsmaniac,2008-09-30T20:49Z,"to zoobezee;
You need to download a program likie daemon
http://www.daemon-tools.cc/dtcc/announcements.php
Then use it's virtual CD/DVD drive and mount the iso file with that, you will be able to play it as though you had the cd in your computer. If you need any further help just holler, but that should do you."
,Pave64,2008-10-12T20:26Z,"Hey, thanks for upload! Works well ;)"
,Pulvermoset,2008-10-19T22:32Z,"I just went for number 4, but it works great, and damn such a sweet game it is. Thank you. :P"

,foreveralone,2009-11-16T19:08Z,"if your looking for mw1 even if u had it most os cant play it any more unless u have a un updated xp os or a ms-dos os or use a ms-dos os simulator (the simulator has its own set of issues alltogether) but if u use sp2 xp or vista ur skrewed when it come to mw1 but these whould work on all os execpt win 7, win 7 has issues with games comeing out its ass"
,foreveralone,2009-11-16T19:48Z,"to anyone who gets the
STOP: cannot find videocard.txt the problem is
if u look in the iso when u mount/burn it the file
thats suposed to be called videocard.txt in the iso
is called videoc_1.txt.... also sutorun had th _1 as well as 2 other files the way to get past this is to mount/burn the image and open th cd and look for setup.exe and just run that
(nice fail with that one man and btw this is on MW4)"
,FreeStuffFTW,2010-03-17T20:15Z,"2 and 4 don't work. After I installed them, when I mounted the disc to play, I'm told to insert the correct CD-ROM. 3 can only run for around ten minutes before crashing. Is this just because I have XP, or did I do something wrong?"
,ttminh,2010-06-09T11:25Z,thank you
,ttminh,2010-06-10T08:38Z,"seed pleaseeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
@FreeStuffFTW: you should check the disk folder, where you can find something called CRACK, then just copy and paste them in the install folder "
,stealthpatch,2010-06-30T22:58Z,"Just finished Downloading Mech Warrior 4. Kewl game.

I'm using Windows 7 Ultimate Edition. It works but you'll have to get through some system prompts.

In the end, it was worth downloading.

but now, I have to either buy a new kayboard for my laptop or reconfigure all the keys for them to run smoothly. Or maybe I'll just buy a joystick. Hehehe."
,c_programmer,2010-08-14T21:57Z,"I was having constant crashing errors on Mech Warrior 3 running a 64 bit version of Windows 7. If anyone else has this, here is how I fixed it:

--Simple Version--
Download the DLL files from these four links:
http://www.dll-files.com/pop.php?dll=ieshims
http://www.dll-files.com/pop.php?dll=iforce2
http://www.dll-files.com/pop.php?dll=dplayx
http://www.dll-files.com/pop.php?dll=msvcp50

Drop those files in into the installation directory (mine is C:\MicroProse\MechWarrior3\ ) and the dependency issues will be solved. I have not gotten a crash since I did this.


--How this works--
The program continually crashes because it tries to reference to DLL files that no longer exist due to major software revisions. A dependency check revealed that it is specifically missing ieshims.dll, msvcp50.dll, iforce2,dll and dplayx.dll. To circumvent conflict issues with other software DO NOT REGISTER THESE WITH THE GAC, just have them in the main install directory."
,RAKENROL_PINOY,2010-10-04T07:45Z,"HALP PLS...I downloaded and installed MW 3 and played it....after training mission i played teh campaign of the first mission and finished that mission....then a screen shows ""teh"" results of the mission 2 choices thar; one is replay mission and the other one is back to main menu...i clicked the back to main menu then the campaign tab again and showed only the first mission PPPLLLEEAAASEEE HAALLLP"

,tech_priest_magnus,2011-01-24T09:12Z,"Awesome torrent! I've been needing to scratch that Mechwarrior itch for a long time! I have a question about Mechcommander 2 though. When I start it up, and it goes through that videocard setup thingie, it pretty much goes down the toilet. The screen shows some grey, garbled graphics, and it pretty much freezes the computer. Has anyone else experienced this? Is there a solution?"
,tech_priest_magnus,2011-01-24T12:07Z,"After scouring the web some more, I figured out what to do - if anyone is having the same problems, delete the ""badcard.csv"" and ""vidcard.csv"" files. The in runs smoothly."
,TwistedTear,2011-01-31T18:13Z,"I just registered to say that this torrent is brilliant. I only download MW4 at first to make sure it was working and it runs perfectly, now downloaded MC2 and that runs fine aswell. Each took bout 40 mins to download though due to low seeders but I will seed to atleast 1:1
Thanks alot tmjam2002 "

,chambo1212,2011-07-12T14:35Z,mechcommander 2 crashes when i try to save. ohter than that works a treat. but when im installing mw 4 how can i get around the insert disc 2 when installing?
,FearisO,2011-09-13T21:20Z,"I know this torrent has died out by now, but can anyone still help me?
I extracted CD1 to a new folder, and CD2 to another, then burned both and installed them. They installed fine, but theres problems.
1. Which .EXE file are you meant to overwrite, the one for CD1 or CD2?
2. It says 'cannot find videocard' even though i burned the whole ISO including it
3. It says 'please insert disk'. I suppose this is because i did the crack wrong, leaading me back to the other two points
HELP!!!"
,gokullalwani,2012-01-02T23:14Z,"downloaded mw3, i can't get it to install on vista-64... when i run setup, nothing happens... go to task manager and it's running... setup.exe, 32-bit launcher... memory usage starts at 2mb and stagnates at about 2.5mb... this happens with numerous installers, and i haven't a clue how to get about it..."
,whmxtra,2012-02-02T07:57Z,"usually when a game gets stuck launching an easy fix is to right click and run it as administrator,  that always fixes it for me."
,dreukrag,2012-02-16T19:45Z,"If you guys have trouble running the games, try installing a virtual box https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads

using one of the winXP downloads you can find here, virtualbox will let the VM use your GPU so you get some decent graphics."
,Eduuuux,2012-02-29T18:22Z,This is the best. I will seed Mech Commander 2 forever. For an updated version of MW4: Merc check out http://www.mektek.net/.
