The VHS tape this was captured from is badly degraded
for the first 9:30 of the video. The degraded part is
only the opening narrative and David Irving's address is
fine. It's not the best quality, but it is watchable and
the information is good.

Mr. Irving currently sits in a German jail for thought crimes.
