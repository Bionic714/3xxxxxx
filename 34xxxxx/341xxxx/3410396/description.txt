Here´s another release from the creator of the outstanding rock/pop musical version of "War of the Worlds". 
Jeff Waynes musical "Spartacus" did however not reach the same heights as his earlier work but it´s still a good
piece of music.

It was released in 1992 and feature artists such as Fish and Catherine Zeta Jones (b4 her commercial Hollywood
breakthrough).

Enjoy....
