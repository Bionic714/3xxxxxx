DVD-RIP (movie only) of Japanese version. I have personally encoded the English subtitles to display ON-SCREEN so you don't have to fool with those separate subtitle files in the other torrents.

This one's pre-encoded to be burned straight to a DVD with your fave DVD burning software. Or you can watch it on your PC with the right software. ENJOI!
