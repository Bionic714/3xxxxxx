This production is the most inclusive expose of the HIV/AIDS fraud. It explains how the fraud began, how it is perpetuated, and who profits by it. The program explains ten reasons why HIV cannot be the cause of AIDS, what the real causes could be, and why dangerous toxic drugs like AZT cause AIDS by prescription.

Interviewed in this program are Dr. Peter Duesberg, Dr. Charles Thomas who initiated the group for Scientific Reappraisal of HIV, along with other experts. This video documentary stands to date as the best complete analysis of these issues in any video form. Much of the current controversy in South Africa and around the world over HIV as the cause of AIDS was initiated by the information presented in this video. This video has saved thousands of lives and is credited as being part of the HIV/AIDS dissident movement worldwide.
