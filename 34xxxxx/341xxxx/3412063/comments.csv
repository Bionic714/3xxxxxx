What a load of crap.   It's been ten years.  Heard anything from Douchbag lately? (couldn't resist twisting his name ... sorry)

""..and is credited as being part of the HIV/AIDS dissident movement worldwide.""

A movement which is conspicuous by its absence.  

Seriously: you don't have to be a scientist or even a brainiac to discover the truth for yourself.  Those folks revealed in this film are dangerous propagandizers (word!)  Everything they say about 99.9% of doctors/scientists worldwide is more aptly applied to them.  

I do agree that you should question everything, and not take on faith what the media/establishment say: but in this case the only fraud is on behalf of these freaks who stick their head in the sand and refuse to see evidence. "
,Boosa,2006-10-15T17:27Z,"Well, I have to say that I find all this very interesting. There is no way in the world that I would take any anti-hiv medicine if tested positive! I would start living a healthier life with exercise and vitamins and positive thinking. I found it very strange that the people who test hiv+ and donÂ´t take the medicine is better off and live longer than the people who take the suicide pills!
And why is it that always when people question something, it becomes a ""conspiracy theory""? 
And if you believe in it the people that always believe the mainstream bullshit says youre a retarded stupid fuck! 
I say; Question everything and you will be better off!"
,Naffnuff,2007-04-08T17:29Z,"If you're one of those guys who just assume that everybody always speaks the truth (and especially high officials and industry representatives), then probably this film won't do anything for you.
If you, however, are one of us who have noticed that, when a lot of money is involved, truth is often quite secondary, then watch it right away!
I did, most skeptical, and found to my suprise that I believe every word of it."
,enotes9,2007-06-30T02:15Z,"I am no genius nor a respected scientist but it seems that something doesn't gel here: HIV is said to cause AIDS (essentially 30 previously known diseases) when it is there, and when it's not there, the ""original causes"" of these 30 diseases are  responsible for them. Only by this definition, is it made possible to achieve a 100% correlation between AIDS and the presence of HIV. The non-correlations are simply ignored... WHY?

A high percentage of subjects (95%) found to have the HI virus, do not present with the AID Syndrome: Total HIV infected 28.1 mil. Total AIDS cases 1.4 mil. (WHO June 1996)"
,thesfx,2007-11-14T20:19Z,"Absolutely DANGEROUS! This debate is as old as AIDS itself. It originated in the ambition of certain scientists and the denial of AIDS diagnosed people. 
Take a look at: http://www.aidstruth.org/debunking-denialist-myths.php"
,enotes9,2008-01-17T02:19Z,"it's funny how passionately the sodomite and drug addicted community want the rest of us to support theories that don't have scientific support (like the HIV-AIDS link). then when science fingers their life style as a curable affliction, they holler ""foul!"" ;) Junkie Rights for all! what next?"
,lisatka,2008-08-28T00:01Z,"This film is quite shocking and it is hard to believe it. I am not sure what to believe, but it doesnt really matter, because I know one thing - I will never take any kind of chemotherapy, including AZT, because it doesnt make sense to poison your body when u need it to be strong to fight! And for that reason, I think this might be the trueth. Also check websites for alternative cancer treatment, very interesting!"
,enotes9,2008-10-20T03:39Z,"thank you for uploading this useful video. i am not sure what to believe either, but question we must - as science is all about asking questions and finding sound answers. it isn't about silencing anyone who does ask questions. even galileo was silenced by narrow minded people who had it in their interests to have people believe one thing over another.

i understand how stupid people are also some of the most insulting types of people around. they also tend to go with the mainstream, seeing their allegiance to the mainstream as giving them some kind of power by association. 

such people become heated in a short time, yelling ""CONSPIRACY NUT"" to everyone who doesn't tow the line, but their passion burns away long before the really serious ones are finished debating anything.

this film makes a very strong argument for a revision of the aids/hiv question.

i bet the insulting people also deny there was a holocaust in 1948-9 in palestine, yet they will jail me for asking how many jews were killed by the nazi's.

funny how it's illegal to study the facts behind one holocaust, and illegal to even mention another one.

this active torrent is still going strong and the debate rages on, though many professionals don't do it openly for fear of losing their status and quite frankly, their licenses to practice medicine. the same goes for the homosexual debate. in the end, the real victims are those who suffer from such politicised illnesses."
,BushKnife,2010-05-08T16:03Z,"Hi I know this may be a long shot (seeing as its quite an old torrent), but could someone please seed this for me? Been trying to find the full version for ages now!"
