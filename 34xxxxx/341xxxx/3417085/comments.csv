,tottomann,2006-01-14T15:00Z,helt syk film. liker du extreme tortur er dette noe for deg
,victimblue,2006-01-15T18:50Z,"This film as much as its disturbing its a classic. It shows the history of what was beyond world war 2's pacific war. The acting is solid as well as the dubbing. It could be shown in theaters today and still would leave its mark on the audiance. I recommend the download. If you like gory films u will like this.....However the true aspect of this is the real story of what the chinese had to endure during that time. The importance of victory for the japanese at any cost and the horrors beyond war. This is an important film.
Quality and sound is excellent. Go to link   http://www.japan-shock.com/menbehindthesun.html

for more info on the film."
,ictv,2006-01-31T11:16Z,"very interesting, thanks heaps sickboy88 "
,shirokuma,2006-02-11T23:55Z,"sickboy88 doesn't know his history very well. In fact, Japan has paid millions of dollars in reparations to China. Japan has paid more than enough yet the Chinese government still demands more and whips its people into an anti-Japan frenzy that leads to attacks on Japanese embassies and other violence. Probably to keep the Chinese people distracted so they won't revolt against their own government. There were no Japanese tried at Nuremberg because the war crime trials for the Pacific war were held in Tokyo and elsewhere in Asia from 1946 to 1948. Unfortunately, the atrocities committed by Unit 731 were not known until the 1970's. To my knowledge there have been no new war crimes trial to convict Unit 731. Furthermore, sickboy88's information about reparations paid to and demanded by Japanese-Americans is just not correct. Do your homwork, sickboy88."
,snakeford,2006-02-16T03:17Z,"I am always a bit of a 'war film scheptic', but this definately feels like a documentation of WW2 suffering minus the spin;
The Japanese have certainly inflicted innumerous horrors on the Chinese people, and this film truly tells of a cruel and horrific Japanese military commiting simply profane acts of torture and depravity on the 'Material', or Chinese and Russion prisoners.
Knowing the reality of the history is bad enough, but the director's uncomprimising use of real autopsy footage and animal mutilation make this one a rough ride, even for a veteran sicko like me!
Watch this film if you want to be given a lesson in the harsh reality of what humans are capable of at their lowest. 

Chilling, but ultimately WELL worth the watch."
,linx05,2006-05-21T11:07Z,Would anybody like to seed this please? :)
,wpgmb03,2006-05-21T20:46Z,thanks love this movie
,yoyosheva,2006-05-29T17:28Z,"shirokuma , I can not believe what kinda shit I hear. I think It's time for you to learn some history now. We didn't take any reparation from your country just because that would be too hard and too cruel for a country that had just taken two atom bomb. I gotta say, I have seen some textbook and some TVreports in your country, they are getting further and further away from the truth."
,victimblue,2006-08-06T14:36Z,Lets put it this way.....Japan owes china some major mulah for compensations to the victims families of nanking and unit 731. The united states should lend a hand as well. They brought some of the information from unit 731 as a deal to let some of the murderers of unit 731 off. Lots of people paid the price of world war 2 but none in my estimation deserve more notice than the chinese people. Ignored for decades.... May god watch over the victims. 
,sippan,2006-09-23T18:17Z,"yoyosheva, shirokuma: Here's history neither of you seem to know: the reason the Japenese were never put on trial for these extraordinarily disgusting war crimes, was that the United States made a deal with them. The research results and data in exchange for immunity for the war crimes. This was in the 1940s. (This according to Wikipedia, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_731 )"
,DanLoader,2006-11-10T16:40Z,Fuck the people... what about the CAT?!?!
,GoldRush22,2006-11-20T06:42Z,CAN MORE SEED THIS MOVIE PLEASE??????
,painto31,2006-11-28T23:00Z,"i had to skip through the cat part... 
fucking chinese people!?!?!"
,jabbaru,2006-12-05T16:05Z,"good comment shirokuma, what an asshole sicboy88"
,pepsimaz,2007-06-19T01:28Z,its sound track is in english but they actualy speak japanese in the original movie.. only downside to this movie :(
,shutterbun,2007-12-03T13:34Z,"I can't believe ten of you haven't jumped on pepsimaz yet to tell him that the original language is actually Cantonese.

Thanks for the upload, sickboy.  I'll leave the history lesson to the experts, though."
,uncuthorror,2008-04-22T21:30Z,HEY SICKBOY I HAVE A COPY WITH ENGLISH SUBS......... GREAT MOVIE.
,the-chojin,2008-05-10T18:31Z,"yeah its true the usa cut a deal with japan for the reserch they did and also kept some of the reaserchers to work for them as they did with the nazis working on the heavy water and v rockets. how do you think they got to the moon.they had werner von brun.
and during ww2 the japs were far more advanced in their weponry including remote control flying bombs remote control submarine bombs and beter guns ect.i done loads of shit in uni about  advanced weponry rockets  japan and the nazis at penamont < cant spell for shit though lol"
,Wopatoolie,2008-05-16T06:20Z,"i noticed there are a few things in the description that are off a tad:

mao tze dong signed a treaty w japan in 1972 to not ask for reparations from ww2, and a 2005 and 2007 case of reparation for individuals and a corporation were thrown out of a japanese high court

nuremburg was for germans, you know in germany.......they had an after-war party for the japanese in tokyo from 1946-1948, and the tokyo trials were more well known than nuremburg at the time

the govt. was sued several times by jap-americans from ww2, and in 1988 the jap-american reparations act was passed; in 1998 the govt. was sued again by them for 1.65 billion they never received

ya, all it took was a quick google to find the truth. youve enlightened me"
,Dustie,2008-08-04T04:18Z,"Boy was i disappointed! 
Saw it with me girlfriend. She is the kind of girl who gets really scared by even the most boring horror movie. Yet this one made her fall asleep. I know its hard facts that this happened for real but still... Not that a movie disturbing at all."
,Dustie,2008-08-04T04:19Z,Not that disturbing  a movie at all*
,chenyu768,2008-10-16T21:40Z,"shirokuma

it's surprising that you say others don't know their history. I'm surprised that they teach history at all in your country.  wait it wasn't a genocide right? it was what was it called, cultural reform, or was it helping us Chinese?  seriously, you guys were worst than the nazis, and yet you guys refuse to acknowledge the past.  This is why you will never rise again, because the countries in Asia, you know the one's you helped in WWII, will not let that happen."
,soviettzu,2008-12-13T07:37Z,so sad :(
,Peanus,2009-01-27T17:56Z,"Thanks sickboy88

The availability of banned/censored films on TPB is what makes me so proud to be a pirate."
,goretouch,2009-11-26T05:33Z,thank you so much :D
,ppptest,2009-12-21T06:26Z,"@DanLoader:
I'm with Painto31. The people scenes are obviously fake, it's a freaking movie after all. They really did kill those cats though."
,nerv666999,2010-01-31T18:30Z,"like most of your uploads sickboy, but I must correct you. The Japanese Americans that were sent to the camps did get reparations, approved by congress on two separate occasions. First under Reagan, and the 2nd under Bush senior. The Chinese protest and they get run over by tanks, so I don't think that their not asking has anything to do with anything other than fear. Reagan: $1.2 B, Bush: $400M and then there's the money given out in 1948. Great thing about America, the govt. fucks you over and some times you get paid. At least here you have a shot"
,1slackjaw,2010-05-06T01:39Z,"Sickboy88, Do you happen to have Part 4? Can't find it being seeded anywhere and it's supposed to be good. Thanks for this torrent also."
,MadHadderall,2010-08-06T05:24Z,I Love Sickboy's rant that is somehow seamlessly interjected into the description of this movie.   u rule
,snakeford,2010-12-22T17:34Z,"Came across this movie again when looking for some 'engaging films'...I think that the cat scene was faked...I remember reading something about a sugary substance being put in the cat's fur, and that the rats ate the sugar, not the cat. This was according to the director. There are a few interviews with him on the net ;)"
