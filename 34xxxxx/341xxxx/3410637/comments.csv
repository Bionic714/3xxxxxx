,Alpots,2008-12-20T13:58Z,Great stuff from one of the Great American Bands
,AbsolutZero,2009-08-02T20:36Z,"This is a very well put together torrent. Very organized. While I am getting this for free, for which I am thankful, I do have to ask. What's with the filenames? Why put the artist, track, album then song name instead of just the song name and let the tags do the rest?

when i put this on my itunes or xbox 360 i can't even read the names and changing them all is going to take a lot of time.

dont get me wrong this is a great download, but damn man."

,ibewsparky55,2010-01-01T16:59Z,"Hi,

I've had problems playing some of these albums songs using WMP 11. It appears that some of the songs are in the MP1-Layer 1 format which is an MP1 but the file extension is MP3. Is there a way to convert these MP1-Layer 1 files into MP1-Layer 3? Thanks!!!!!"
,gdog666,2010-12-23T22:52Z,Thanks for keeping this music alive. These guys produced some of the best music of the 70's.
