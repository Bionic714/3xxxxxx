The Format - Interventions and Lullabies
Genre: Indie



Amazon Review: The Format is a groundbreaking and revolutionary band that successfully combines rock, alternative, and indie music into one triumphant album, "Interventions and Lullabies". This album includes quite a diverse collection of songs. "On Your Porch" and "A Save Situation" are both beautiful acoustic ballads with moving vocals, while "Tune Out", "Sore Thumb", and "Wait, Wait, Wait" are all easy to sing to as well as just being feel good songs. The strong point of this album I believe is its stirring lyrics. They are both thought-provoking and alluring, along with poetic. "Interventions and Lullabies" is a record you can listen to time and time again, no matter what kind of mood you're in. The Format does a wonderful job with this one, creating an enduring piece of art that will be appreciated well into the future.
