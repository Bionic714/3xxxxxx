This is one of several music videos I have, and the first in many torrents that I will share as these get seeded more. NTSC, English only

----------from torrent file comments------------------

This is the music video for the song by War, called Why can't we be friends? and from what I've seen is extremely hard to find. Originally recorded by my ex-wife, mushroomfarie, and hosted and shared by me. I hope you enjoy it!
