These recordings are studio versions of songs performed by The Young Gods at the Kurt Weill tribute concert staged in Switzerland in September 1989, at the request of the Festival du Bois de la Batie (Geneva) and Fri-Son (Fribourg). The seven interpretations featured represent but a fraction of Kurt Weill's diverse oeuvre.
