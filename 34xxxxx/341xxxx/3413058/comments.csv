Guess you have to take it or leave it. Guess it isn't any more to choose from.

Would be great if anyone could upload more of Odyssey 5.
Many thanks to anyone who can help!"

Will seed :)"
,ragesRemorse,2008-09-15T12:56Z,Is this the full 20 episodes or just the 14 episodes that originally aired?

,dzenanz,2011-03-23T20:18Z,"Unfortunately this is some uncommon version, no subtitle fits, and there are audio/video synchronization problems in some episodes."
,dzenanz,2011-03-23T20:21Z,"Anyway, thanks to the uploader, but there are other versions available. I am downloading this one right now: http://bitsnoop.com/odyssey-5-s01-ws-dvdrip-xvid-bia-q22201108.html"
,sn4tchbuckl3r,2012-06-01T08:32Z,"Seeing as how the other Odyssey 5 torrents are barely tolerable, I personally ripped and upped the DVD version just now.
