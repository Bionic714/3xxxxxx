,halofubar,2008-05-27T01:25Z,"I've just released a complete Mandarin set, called ""Absolute Pimsleur's Mandarin Chinese [MP3]"", which contains all of the files encoded by myself in high-quality MP3 format (LAME encoder), plus all of the supplementary materials including the owner's manual and reading booklets. You can find the link for it on my website at http://www.halofubar.com. Enjoy!"
,highlander777,2008-06-11T20:16Z,"Halofubar,

Is there a link to this torrent file outside of Demonoid?
I am not registered with them and can't download the torrent file.
 I would like to get lesson 28 of unit 1. 
It appears lesson 23 is dupicated in lesson 28.
Thanks.
"
,highlander777,2008-06-11T20:24Z,"Nevermind, I found it. Thanks for the heads up though."
,halofubar,2009-03-12T04:15Z,"@highlander777:

I put a mirror right here on TPB b/c people (like you) were looking for one.

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4764944

I now use Demonoid for my main torrent releases (the site has a lot more features...), and I use both MiniNova and ThePirateBay for mirrors. I hope that is a satisfying arrangement for everyone."
