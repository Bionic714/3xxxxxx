There's many ways to change the language in NFS:MW, but
not everybody know's how to edit files manually in
REGEDIT. SO. Ive made a lil' proggy to help those who
dont know how to do it, and want NFS:MW in their own
language.

Just run the program, select you language, and press
the APPLY button.

Simple? Yes. Good? hmm. well if you dont understand
english its good. Give it to ya lil' bro' and he'll
be happy for a day :|
