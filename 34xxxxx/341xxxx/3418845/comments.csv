,Morbo_JJ,2006-08-20T12:06Z,"So what is this exactly. 

And I don't mean, explain what Salvia divinorum is, because I know that already. What is this movie about exactly? "
,ironwhimp,2006-08-27T19:37Z,"Well, obviously it's about Salvia Divinorum.
If it's the one I think it is, it's a documentary about the drug including an experiment where a subject takes the drug and, during and after, describes his experiences."
