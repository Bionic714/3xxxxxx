WELL ITS WHAT THE NAME SAYS IT IS>>>>

WindowBlinds is a program that enables users to personalize their Windows XP PC with thousands of different visual styles.

Advantage Description 
Zero-Footprint Mode WindowBlinds 5 requires no in memory programs in order to work. Moreover, while Windows XP includes a built in skinning system called Uxtheme.dll,  WindowBlinds uses wblind.dll instead and its skins tend to use less memory than the included .msstyles. 
Explorer Views  and much more are skinned Because WindowBlinds skinning uses the native XP theming APIs, it not only skins the Explorer views, but it goes beyond that to skin other elements such as the  "please wait" dialog, dialog backgrounds, log off dialog, and much more. Only WindowBlinds provides a complete skinning solution for Windows XP users. 
Outstanding Application Compatibility WindowBlinds not only can skin theme-aware applications but non-theme aware programs too. 
Integrated into .Suite files The most popular format for putting together sets of themes and skins is the .suite format. With a .suite file. With it, you can change all your icons, GUI, Windows Media Player and third party programs such as Trillian, Winamp, Hoverdesk, NeXTStart, CursorXP, and much more. WindowBlinds is natively supported by the .suite format. 
Hardware acceleration WindowBlinds makes use of today's video cards to accelerate the painting of visual styles. As a result, every posted independent test shows that WindowBlinds version 4 is significantly faster than the bundled visual styles. 
No hooking of SetWindowsHookEx WindowBlinds does not use SetWindowsHookEx. Systems hooks, contrary to some claims, do not necessarily slow down the system. But in any event, WindowBlinds 5 does not use SetWindowsHookEx. 
Multiple Font Sizes, Colorizing, and more. WindowBlinds can work at any DPI, any font size, and supports users changing the color of the visual style on the fly. Only WindowBlinds can do all this. 
Enhanced GUI controls WindowBlinds supports third party extensions to the title bar and borders. For example, users can add roll-up buttons, always on top buttons, MP3 controls, etc. to the title bar as part of their visual style. 
Integrated into Theming APIs Microsoft has added a new theming API to Windows XP.  WindowBlinds supports the Theming APIs of Windows XP. In addition, it supports the DirectSkin API that is used by many companies to develop skinnable programs.  
True Alpha-Blending support WindowBlinds supports per-pixel alpha blending on nearly all parts of the OS.  Only WindowBlinds can apply skins that eliminate jaggies, are semi-transparent, and just look more polished on Windows XP.
