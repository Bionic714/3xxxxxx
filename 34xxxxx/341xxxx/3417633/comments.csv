I fell in love with TSA (and by default, Savatage) after catching the amazing house-light show set to 'Wizards of Winter'  and while I made a good faith attempt to buy em at the record store, they had sent TSA's records back with the christmas stock, leaving me no choice but to DL. :D"

,inaneframe,2008-01-25T00:46Z,"This is a great torrent but keep in mind that they do not have ID tags!  So either be prepared with easytag or download the other one, it will say with ID tags in the name of the torrent.

And thanks to the guy who did these, he spent a good amount of time on them, just don't figure how he could have missed the tags!  IMPORTANT dude!"

,AbsolutZero,2009-08-18T01:34Z,"I heard about these guys on the radio and saw them Dec 30th, 2008 in cleveland. it was their 10th anniversary show and it was amazing.

i have to have everything theyve done. i wish i could find the 10 minute ""cleveland rocks"" jam they did at the end though"
