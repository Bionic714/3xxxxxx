Sam Fryman's book offers the true knowledge of kundalini yoga and explanation of all religions, which is currently being suppressed or ignored by society at everybody's peril, because it explains the true nature of the human journey on this planet, and the true cause and destiny of our evolution - which is to evolve to a blissful state of cosmic consciousness - and therefore, the purpose of our lives.

This book was originally posted as "Preventing the Apocalypse", but has now been slightly revised and retitled as "Kundalini - Preventing the Apocalypse", because it appears that many potential downloaders and readers did not grasp from the title what the subject matter was.

Anybody who wants to know the truth of why society is going wrong now, and the meaning of their own life in the grander scheme of things should read this work, which has been written in as simple a form as possible, and is not beyond the intellectual understanding of an averagely bright fifteen year old.
