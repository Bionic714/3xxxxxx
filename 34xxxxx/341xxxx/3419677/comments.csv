,Jammy_Stuff,2006-01-22T02:04Z,Does it come with an activation crack or don't you need to activate 2003?
,fr0ntl1n3,2006-01-24T16:21Z,has ANYONE had any problems with this distro?
,Dameon87,2006-01-24T23:06Z,Works perfectly. No Activation timebomb or anything. Running like a champ :) Just use the key included and you will be up and running in no time. Whoops windows Xp's Ass.
,elecboy,2006-02-02T01:22Z,"Works Great. fast to download 40Kbs/sec Remeber that the KEY is in the ISO if you have WinRAR and no other program installed that knows the .iso extension, unziped and you will find the KEY."
,ravendj,2006-02-13T09:28Z,"I have successfully downloaded the file and I have put it onto a disc and made it bootable, I try to install and it starts off ok but when the PC reboots it says that i may not have enough memory to complete installaiton or the CD may be corrupt....why is this???"
,john11smith,2006-03-19T03:47Z,"Works perfectly, thanks"
,jlukensow,2006-03-27T22:27Z,"Remember guys, you do NOT have to make the cd bootable or go through any of that mess.  All you have to do is burn the ISO with Ultra ISO or Nero to a CD and thats that.  No need to make it bootable, the ISO already is.
