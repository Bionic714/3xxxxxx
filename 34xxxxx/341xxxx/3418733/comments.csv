,Lundo,2006-03-14T12:53Z,vad anvĂ¤nder man fĂśr *.cbr ????
,kavver,2006-03-17T00:07Z,Is this the Movie? V for Vendetta by Alan Moore?
,Torio,2006-03-18T10:37Z,"No it is not the movie, it is the comic book."
,smoketon,2006-03-18T17:12Z,no this is the comic book
,v v,2006-03-24T02:05Z,"how can i see the file?I have download it but i cant see it, :("
,Evil-Schumi,2006-03-31T12:35Z,Kinda annoying when people sets files for download when they not write the whole thing about it.
,mrmikel,2006-04-01T22:17Z,"""V for Vendetta complete, issues #1-10"" seems pretty self-descriptive to me! It's issue 1-10 of the comic. What else should he have written?"
,Countra,2006-06-26T01:04Z,"Why do u ppl have to complain about everything? ""He didn't say it was .cbr!"", ""He didn't tell the hole thing"" ""he bla bla la..."" Stop the bullshit god dammit! he has upploaded a good file and u ppl should appriciate it instead of complaining! Okey, fine he forgot some things, so what? And for the noobs that doesn't know how to use CDisplay, rightclick on the grey screen (which appears when you open the program) click on ""Load files"" or u can just click on L, then find the file you are going to open..."
,The_Swarm,2006-09-04T05:44Z,"I may just be being stupid but when i use CDisplay it will load the file but loads it as nothing but the cover page.
How do i open the inner pages?"
,The_Swarm,2006-09-04T07:27Z,"Never mind i got it, for anyone who needs to know you press page up and page down to go up and down."
,ghorkov,2008-05-22T22:47Z,"wow, nice torrent. I am however happy someone told about .cbr files, never heard of it. Thank you!"
,41R534,2008-06-04T13:56Z,"About *.cbr (and .cbz, .cbt and .cba) I just learned that if you rename them respectively .rar, .zip, .tar and .ace, you can open them like normal archives.
CB* is ""comic book"".
Try wikipedia about that."
,sinuhete,2008-06-24T03:40Z,"wow, fuck GREAT, man. Seems to be a bunch of ignorants about the CDisplay and he digital comics, as i see in these previous comments."
,chocolatebear,2009-01-14T08:48Z,"Great upload, thanks, CDisplay is the only way I read comics. :D"
,dudedudedudedoh,2009-04-19T12:31Z,"Just rename the files to .RAR, and you can open them."
,Kelzvieira,2009-12-11T13:12Z,"Wow, a lot of angry people. Some people have never heard of .cbr files, so I get the confusion. It's a file type usually used for comic book viewing. For PC users you can use CDisplay and Mac users can get FFview to open and read through these. However, if these programs don't work for you or you prefer not to download them, or whatever reason, all you have to do is change the file extension type from .cbr to .rar or .zip, then just extract them and view normally.
