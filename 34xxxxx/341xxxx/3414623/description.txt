Description: Cosmo Vitelli is a strip joint owner whose compulsive gambling leaves him owing a large sum of money to a mob boss. The mobsters are willing to give him an alternative in settling his debt by doing a job, the killing of a Chinese bookie. Though it may sound like your average gangster flick, The Killing of a Chinese Bookie is certainly not. Cassavetes as usual focuses heavily on character and disregards the story to the point that it never really finishes, at the end Cosmo's fate remains a mystery. By ignoring the genre's necessity of a rigidly structured story Cassavetes clearly points out that this isn't a crime film but a film about the man behind the criminal whose own compulsions will eventually drive him to his destruction. Cassavetes's regular Ben Gazzara is at great shape and gives an amazing performance.
