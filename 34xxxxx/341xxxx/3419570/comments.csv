,bumchunder,2006-03-21T19:38Z,"Mega^ you sad , deficient, retarded bastard. This torrent has been downloaded 4892 times, and to my reckoning that about 4892 people who should have been drowned at birth.

Seriously, WTF people? This is the sodding SPICE GIRLS!"
,Loopkidd,2006-04-02T12:06Z,4893!
,Soda08,2006-07-15T20:59Z,"Who gives a shit if we like spice girls? Everyone has different music tastes. I sure as hell can't stand Mike Jones, but you don't see me going to Mike Jones torrent pages and ripping on them, do you? That's what I thought."
,RuurdWoltring,2006-07-16T17:44Z,"I like the Spice Girls a lot, but unfortunately, I cannot download the 'Complete Spice Girls Discography (with live/rare tracks)'-torrent. Can you do something about this, please? Greetings, Ruurd Woltring from the Netherlands."
,RuurdWoltring,2006-07-16T18:08Z,"I discovered that it takes a while before this torrent starts with downloading, and now I'm happy and glad about it. Thanks for fixing the problem, if you did, of course. Greetz, Ruurd Woltring from the Netherlands."
,Wasphead,2006-07-31T21:40Z,"great torrent!! There are songs there that i didn't know they excisted. But this is not the complete discography of the girls, i,ve got quite a few songs that aren't in this list. So i'll try to make a new torrent with even more songs. thanx a lot!!! "

,Coldylox,2009-03-02T10:20Z,"Bumchunder, firstly, with a name like that you shouldn't even be allowed to post. Second, spice girls have made some of the most catchy female pop songs of all time. I'm downloading it because in my vast music library I realized that I never downloaded their songs. I still hear them from time to time on videos, radio, etc. and had to have their music as .mp3"
,Coldylox,2009-03-02T13:30Z,"sweet jesus, this shit is 128kbps! waste of fucking time and space! who the fuck makes 128k mp3s anymore?!?"
[T],Dark_Swordsman,2009-07-27T15:59Z,"128 kps dont matter...you can use dbPoweramp Music converter on the songs to beef them up, thats all...and they will be even better"
,Arcadiex,2010-03-16T04:06Z,"My friend got a new iPood and wants me to fill it up with a lot of screamo and metal bands and whatnot, but I know deep down inside of him that this is his favorite band, I'm doing him a favor by putting this on his iPood, and you did me a favor by putting this up on The Pirate Bay. Thanks Potvora007!"
,spiritz86,2010-10-10T23:31Z,Thank you!
,gerrysky,2011-03-13T05:55Z,thank u so much for your upload!!! spice girl power 4 ever long live the 90's!!
,Online.Pirate,2011-09-02T17:21Z,"@Dark_Swordsman
With songs being at 128kbps theres no point trying to ""beef them up"".. it's not like it's going to reveal hidden quality in the song. It will just be using up more disc space for the same quality.

It would be like taking a shitty cassette and copying it onto cd.. it may be on cd but it will still be shitty quality.

True 320kbps rips are always the best way to go :)"
