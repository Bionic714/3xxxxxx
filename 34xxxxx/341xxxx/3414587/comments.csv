,s___amson,2008-05-29T23:18Z,"Battosai28: Get a good torrent client and you can choose not to download some files.

Google is your friend."
,shador,2008-07-02T15:40Z,"A really awesome torrent thank you. 

But is there a reason to the blur on all the movies? It's like they are all out of focus somewhat."
,666LordAlucard,2008-10-05T11:20Z,"These series are GREAT and MGS4 is the best game EVER.

Can't wait to see how they'll pull off the movie... they better cast David Hayter as Snake though! ^^"
