FASCINATION (1979) dir. Jean Rollin

This is Rollin at his best; visual delights, sensual lesbian lovemaking, the beautiful Lahaie as a
scythe-wielding avenger, and a group of blood drinking bourgeois women.

IMDb review:
'Fascination' is a very apt title for this spellbinding movie!
A typically dreamlike and stylish work from the remarkable Jean Rollin.
Yup, it's another lesbian vampire movie (from a decade that produced quite a few!)
but Rollin, like Jess Franco, puts his own original touches to it which make it truly unforgettable.
Like most of Franco's (and Dario Argento's) output, atmosphere and aesthetics are more important
than plot, and the performances of the actors involved are variable.
Rollin doesn't seem to be too concerned with creating believable characters, he uses his (beautiful)
actresses as striking images moving across a background.
His movies are often closer to paintings than your standard Hammer horror.
That's why 'Fascination' is so unlike most vampire movies you'll ever see.
Inspired and original. Don't miss this one!
