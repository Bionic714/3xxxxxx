,Captain_Planet,2011-01-30T14:28Z,"Reading ""Classic horror flick that was originally aired on the ABC network in 1973"" would answer your question."

,kneenose,2011-08-13T00:53Z,how about the quality anyone?
,tommygun264,2011-09-07T11:46Z,"Saw this when I was 10 and it scared the hell out of me. To this day I still have flashbacks on those dark nights when I am alone and think I see something moving on the shadows out the corner of my eye. The way the creatures appeared to be able to change size really made my young imagination go wild - I house sat for a couple where the wife had a business making highly detailed miniature furniture, lamps, etc. for doll houses and she had three large, completely furnished doll houses she used as settings to photograph her wares for her website, one of which looked like the old mansion they kept on the landing of the staircase between the ground floor and the bedrooms. I covered the thing with a sheet and it still gave me the willies every time I passed by it, or walked past the staircase going to and from the restroom in the middle of the night. Unlike ""Psycho"", ""Jaws"", ""Alien"" or ""Halloween""; which were scary, but in an entertaining way, THIS hokey TV movie made me wish I had never seen it. God help me, I find myself wanting to watch it again, hoping I'll find it dated and no longer scary."
,bucknastee,2011-09-19T19:50Z,"Just watched it last night, quite entertaining. good audio and video for a 40 year old movie.
So the new one came out November 6th 2010, it is 10 months later and it still isn't up on this site. I managed to get a copy before it got removed. Is there a reason all the new movies coming out keep getting deleted?"
