Subject: Fur farming in the People's Republic of China


Your Excellency, Ladies and Gentlemen,

I am horrified to read about the recently revealed results of investigations into Chinese fur farms.
Investigators found workers attempting to stun animals by repeatedly slamming them against the ground 
or bashing their heads with clubs. Many animals were still alive blinking and struggling desperately to 
survive when workers flipped them onto their backs or hung them up by their legs or tails to skin them.
When workers began cutting the skin and fur from these still living animals' legs, their free limbs 
kicked and writhed, leaving the animals to suffer for five to ten minutes after being skinned alive. 

Please ensure that this cruelty is immediately ended by enacting regulations to outlaw this cruelty. 

Yours sincerely
