Download: DAEMON Tools 4.00

Description: 

DAEMON Tools is a virtual cd/dvd-rom emulator. It is able to emulate nearly all known copy protections on the market today. This version has an option to install client-side software applications (DAEMON Tools Searchbar and Save Now) that deliver a limited number of behaviorally targeted and contextually relevant coupons, ads and comparative shopping results directly to consumers desktops - without compromising the privacy, security or smooth functioning of peoples computers! No URL hijacking or redirects! In order to support FREE distribution of DAEMON Tools we highly encourage you at least to try out this optional software! (you can remove it anytime later when you wish: via Control Panel-> Add/Remove Programs)

They have a lot of load on their servers since this version came out. Compared to 3.47 it can create ISO files of even copy protected games without you needing to crack them. I have just releived their website from extra load.

Oh by the way you don't have to install the DAEMON Tools Searchbar and Save Now software just say no during installation and you are all set. Still questions just visit the website.
