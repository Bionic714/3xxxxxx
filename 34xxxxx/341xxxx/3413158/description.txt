Mac OSx86 Build 8f1099 with Universal iTunes and Patched with Maxxuss PPF patcher + Extra maxxuss patches

I didn't make any of it, I just compiled it into a nice ISO for complete N00bz :)

Here are some things you should remember when installing this:

1. If installing in vmware, do not mount the ISO with vmware, mount it with daemon tools or alcohol120% and set vmware to use that

2. currently, you need PAE and SSE2 to boot this in vmware, however it will not boot native without NX

After it is installed, you can look on the cd in dir "Maxxuss Extras" and you will find a few drivers from Maxxuss's site, this should make it easier to get a fully functional system without having to switch back and forth between Mac and Windows


Here are the notes from Maxxuss:

Booting and Installing

The patched ISO image contains three different Mach Kernels. You need to boot the patched DVD/ISO with the right kernel for your CPU needs:

    * mach_kernel (default): same as mach_kernel.sse2,
    * mach_kernel.sse2: supports SSE2 CPUs, requires NX/XD CPU support,
    * mach_kernel.nonx: supports SSE2 CPUs, does not require NX/XD CPU support,
    * mach_kernel.orig: the original kernel, for use with SSE3 CPUs with NX/XD support.

If you're fine with the default kernel, there is nothing to do. (If you get the error "Cannot load /com.apple.Boot.plist" after the boot prompt, enter the boot promt and hit Return; this might help.)

But if you require for example "mach_kernel.nonx", then you should press F8 at the Mac Boot Prompt and enter "mach_kernel.nonx".
Booting from the Installed Mac OS X Volume

After the installation has succeeded, you can now boot your new system. As before, there are several kernels available for your CPU needs (see the list above: mach_kernel, mach_kernel.sse2, mach_kernel.nonx and mach_kernel.orig.

To select your kernel of choice, you have several options:

    * Enter the name at the boot promt, e.g. "mach_kernel.nonx",
    * As root or with "sudo" copy the kernel file to "mach_kernel", e.g. "cp /mach_kernel.nonx /mach_kernel",
    * As root or with "sudo" edit the file "com.apple.Boot.plist" in the folder "/Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration".

Notes
VMWare

If you boot Mac OS X 10.4.3 in VMWare please note:

    * Set "paevm=true" in your .vmx configuration file

    * Mount the ISO using Daemon Tools etc., not with the VMWare CD/DVD drive emulation.
