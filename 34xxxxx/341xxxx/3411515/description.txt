Episode # 11 in the series of comedic works from PornoReviewers.com, where Ross and Dave discuss the finer points of adult cinematography - and keep you laughing in the meantime.

In Episode 11, Dave joins the Porno Reviewers team, bringing dry wit and hours and hours and hours and hours of porno watching experience. This week's movie, Heaven Sent, is about a guy who dies and goes to heaven when he finds out that his girlfriend is cheating on him. To learn more about women, he goes back to Earth as a series of hot women and screws a bunch of guys. With lots of hot, heterosexual sex, this movie scored a 4 out of 5.
