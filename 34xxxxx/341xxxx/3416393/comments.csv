,chuby1tubby,2012-07-14T03:10Z,Took me about 5 hours to download this. I'm not sure how fast you people are expecting it to go but 155 seeders is plenty! Mine went at about 500kB/s on average.
,TornAsunder,2012-08-23T05:33Z,"Great quality, both sound and video wise. There are a few ""blackouts"" and sound stutters in a few of the episodes but it doesn't occur often enough to be of an annoyance and said problems don't even last for more than a second at a time. I'm not sure why people are having problems with the last three episodes as they were working just fine for me.
