***Some folks in here have a nasty habit of spamming my posts with false virus warnings, and would eventually, possibly, try to get me banned from this place. I upload A LOT of material about 9/11 being a staged event, and they seem to trigger a lot of those false virus warnings from a user named "b2pilot187". Now, he is obviously either a disinformer or simply just the everyday-idiot, because my files are videofiles, hence impossible to infect with a virus. This user has been reported to the admins of this place, so I hope this matter will be setled sooner rather than later. Until then, simply ignore this person. But I would urge anyone not to ignore a virusscan in any event. I suspect he won't even read this, because he simply searches for "911" and spam each and every post with these warnings. Hence, you will probably find another one below, in the comment section.***

Synopsis:

The nationwide news network C-span has broken the blackout on the 9/11 truth movement, raising hopes that other media outlets will follow, by deciding to broadcast a lecture by David Ray Griffin in Madison, Wisconsin. Griffin, an acclaimed philosopher-theologian and author of the 9/11 truth blockbusters "The New Pearl Harbor" and "The 9/11 Commission Report: Omissions and Distortions", has made a rare public appearance and a brand-new talk, entitled "9/11 and the American Empire: How Should Religious People Respond?". It will focus on the ethical and spiritual dimension of facing the overwhelming evidence that the Bush Administration was complicit in the attacks of September 11th, 2001.
