,Porkster,2006-01-19T00:52Z,"Alex Jones is just a pipe piper anyway. He never connects the dots that all these organisations are jewish based. All from neo-cons to freemasons.   Peter Shaenks is the best current shaker, so check him out over at http://www.vanguardnewsnetwork.com/2005/VNNB/psworldwide.htm"

LOL - now the Masons are Jewish too. What next? Al-Qaeda?"

,bunglex,2008-05-25T21:09Z,"I am Australian and only just discovered Alex Jones's radio and movies. Due to the sensational claims made I need independent validation. I fact checked the most important of Alex Jones statements (everything I could get access to), and to my surprise I verified everything I looked into. Wow this guy has a library of information in his head! He is more fact based than most journalists. Its just a pity he makes himself sound like a conspiracy nut by the way he speaks and surmises. Maybe more people would open their minds if he was a little more gentle in his statements."
