,CarnageHeart,2011-01-17T20:52Z,"For anyone having the ""DirectX 9 not installed"" error. Do the following:

1. Make the directory that you want NFSMW Black ""installed"" to.

2. Mount up the first cd.
   2a. Copy over the following files from CD1
    - DIAG.EXE
    - speed.exe
    - server.dll
    - server.cfg
    - 0compressed.zip
    2b. Mount CD2 and copy the following
    - RunGame.exe
    - 1compressed.zip
    2c. Mount CD3 and copy 2compressed.zip, then CD4 and copy 3compressed.zip

3. Once you have all of those files copied, unzip all of the zip files inside of that same folder, preserving directory structure so that you end up with folders named ""MOVIES"" ""SOUND"" and such.

4. Once everything is unzipped, mount CD1 (it still does a CD check even using this method) and to run the game just double click speed.exe

Have fun!
(Note: You DO NOT need to find a no-cd crack for this game. I'm using DaemonTools without any drive ghosting and the game starts up fine)"

,Pumpsoul,2011-08-24T17:58Z,"Works fine on Windows 7 x86-x64 but i`ve got problem on Win XP SP3, after the all installs steps i mount the CD1, execute and it comes to display something like ""Put the correct cd to play"" or something like that. So avoid to install on Win XP unless someone have the solution."

,gameslover007,2011-10-07T06:29Z,there is no serial key and crack in the torrent which are very important.Serial key is. YFEE-CHWG-7FUK-U6RE-L7BL and you can download crack from this link. http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3427700/Need_For_Speed__Most_Wanted_Crack-Fully_Working__
,dejvik.m,2011-10-30T10:30Z,"Guys, it's very easy.

Download torrent, but in your program delete download of Bonus DVD (it has 1.28 GB and it's unnecessary). If you want, delete download of all songs (original soundtrack) too. If will be download of 4 CD's done, mount all CD's (during instalation) and than open CD 1. The game will start.

YOU DON'T NEED CRACK!

CD KEY IS IN DESCRIPTION OF FILE OR COMMENTS.

(And sorry for my english, I learn it about three years. I think you understand? :)"
,dejvik.m,2011-10-30T11:31Z,"Sorry, you need crack.. scroll up :)"
