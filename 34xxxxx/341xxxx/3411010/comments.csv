,RareRazz,2008-05-25T22:51Z,"Its possible! Just change the controls to ""Mouse n Keyboard"" i think. I already have this, but in my version the music is gone, cuz it needs the CD to play it... But is this with the music?"

,ILoveSky,2010-06-13T20:24Z,"This works, the game is kind of horrible though, it doesn't even have mouse support."
,ratedloud,2011-10-16T20:38Z,"you guys yes there is mouse support. before you click on start turok, go to controls and switch to mouse and keyboard. Also does anyone know what was removed from the game to make it so compressed?"
