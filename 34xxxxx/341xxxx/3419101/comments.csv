,Nomad1986,2006-01-05T12:53Z,haha yea he wants to know that. the file is packed.... unpacked it is over 1 gig...... so it do not fit on a 1 gig card
,Tigersaid,2006-01-05T14:26Z,"Stop complay!
The download time is less if it is less.
Do you want to download this game in original .iso file at 1gb insted of 374mb?

Morons. 

It's good like this, but he could have written that it is 1gb file."
,Garkan,2006-01-28T12:51Z,Temprix: Burned. Thought you was smart. Many file get smaller when they are packed down.

,Henrylenry,2006-02-08T18:57Z,"Hur installerar man Sims 2?
Andra spel är i ISO-format men inte Sims 2. Det står inget i ""read me"" om hut man installera spelet. Jag har lagt in några homebrews men sims 2 liknar inte deras format.
Någon som vet hur man gör??"

,mcoutlawz,2006-05-13T23:00Z,"This doesn't work for me, using v1.5, umdemulator, MPHloader on a 2Gb card.  It should work because the game is 2.0 but it won't start!!  ...Does this actually work for anyone out there???"
,mcoutlawz,2006-06-28T21:06Z,"THIS WORKS, using Devhook 0.40 (rebooting in 2.5 mode)."
,Temprix,2006-08-06T02:06Z,"Haha fucking nubs. Ouch I'm so hurt from some online nobody. It can fit, you just have to know how to use compression and rip out other parts.

Done with this page haha."

rename *.0?? *.r??

Then extract as normal with winrar"

1. Extract with 7-Zip
2. Copy the .iso to the ISO folder on your memory card
3. Load it up on your PSP, from the XMB menu.
4. Enjoy! :)
