The Sims 2 is the first entirely-new generation of The Sims, the ground-breaking game that allowed players to create and control people. The Sims 2 challenges you to direct the journey of your Sims lives as they grow from infancy through childhood, teenage life and adulthood. Starting with a personality that you give them (or that they inherit from their parents), your Sims will develop in unique ways based on your choices and influence. As they progress through life, your Sims will collect memories which shape who they are, what options they have and how they behave. These experiences can have a short or long-term effect on relationships between family members and friends. Experiences between Sims when they are children can affect their relationships as teens and adults. Your Sims can have casual friendships or make life-long enemies. 
The Sims 2, you control your Sims over an entire lifetime for the first time. With the ground-breaking addition of genetics, your Sims now pass their DNA down through generations giving you a more vivid and in-depth Sims experience. Every life choice you make has a relevant and dramatic effect on the lifetime of your Sim. Its up to you to take your Sims from the cradle to the grave, fulfill their dreams, and push them to extremes in The Sims 2.
