 Custom Mods.........: Custom mplayer.dll compiled from CVS with GCC 3.4.4
                       using --disable-libavformat. Greatly reduces the size of 
                       the dll at the cost of not being able to demux a few
                       obscure formats.
                       WMV9, RealVideo and Quicktime codecs included and tested.
                       Graphics of the webserver interface optimized.
                       Reduced the bloated scripts from 3601KB to 941KB.
                       Added weather display and IP address to home screen.
                       Scripts menu edited to include added scripts.

 Release Notes.......: Replaced the huge set of Mildrop presets with a set
                       containing only the best ones.
                       To remove either weather or IP address from home screen:
                       Edit skin\Project Mayhem III\PAL\Home.xml (or PAL16x9).
                       At the bottom of the file, change <visable> from true to
                       false for the control you want to remove.
