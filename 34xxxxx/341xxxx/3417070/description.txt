A Selection of Terence McKenna vids.  Some are lectures, some are more formal video productions.  I will be putting up Volume Two in a week or so.

Videos are mostly ripped from vcd's (DAT files), so you either need to convert them or simply play them in VLC Media Player, free for all platforms. (Search google for VLC).

Videos included in Volume One:

Experiment at Petaluma
Hallucinogens and Culture
Psychedelic Society
Seattle 1999 (Windows Mediaplayer File)
Sydney 1997
Time and the I-Ching
Timewave Zero

Enjoy!
