,konstnaki,2008-04-02T00:22Z,I think you need Norton Ghost 2003 build 775
[T],trackers,2008-06-26T12:43Z,This is Norton.Ghost.2003.793
,the_epoch,2008-11-30T06:10Z,"This is NOT Norton Ghost 2003!

This is yet another fake file.
This is also Adobe Acrobat Reader 5.0.5 - Do not download unless you want to install Adobe Acrobat."
,the_epoch,2008-11-30T06:51Z,"This is NOT Norton Ghost 2003.
This is Adobe Reader 5.0.5.

Try Symantec_Norton_Ghost_2003_by_Tygroso instead:

,Umpie,2011-03-23T14:45Z,"Stop nagging. 
THIS IS NORTON GHOST 2003
It is the complete Nero-Disk image of the CD, 
and that CD contains also Actrobat reader 5.

Don't download the torrent from Tygroso, that is an older incomplete version."
,Techowl,2011-10-06T03:07Z,This is the real Ghost 2003. It is version 793. There is also an Adobe installer on the same disc because the manuals are in PDF format.
