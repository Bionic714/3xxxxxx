,MorgothBauglir,2008-04-15T18:59Z,"lol yourself. the original movie is in russian/finnish/sami (everybody of the three protagonists speaks a different language, thats the whole ""joke"" of the story) and this version is definitely russian-dubbed in this annoying eastern europe-style. really a shame, that way it's quite terrible to watch. not to mention 90% of the world doesn't understand it without useful subtitles.."
