,moggie52,2008-09-30T01:12Z,"this does work if you install the program when requested enter the product key. Do Not register and do not run the game when asked.
Copy the Speed.exe and paste it into the EA Games folder NFSMW folder.
This will replace the Speed file and allow the game to run without the disk.
restart your computer and the run the game."
