,blaze7,2006-01-15T23:38Z,"if you just download the file Builder6-full+updates.rar then you will have all the files you need.  The other files in the torrent have been unpacked from it. Right click all the files in the torrent other than ""Builder6-full+updates.rar"" and select ""do not download file""."

,omidvaar,2009-03-26T04:14Z,"I'm trying to install Borland C++6. When I run CD1, after entering the erial number, it asks me to choose the path where Builder 5 is installed! Is this program just for updating an older version of C++ Builder rather than installing from zero? thanks in avdance."

,Inspirare,2010-02-17T00:00Z,"Guys who has problem with installing,if you got ""update window"" from borland 5.0 just use another serial
It can be obtained from keygen 
here's one for you
serial key:pkcj-3s67?-ecdfm
authorization key:uru-kqq

if doesnt work - download ketgen"
,ofurao,2012-07-26T19:17Z,"What a shitty .torrent:
-twice time the same content in different .rar files
-the files from each CD into .rar instead of .iso files, forcing you to generate a .iso file for each CD
-currupted CD2 content
-wrong serial key, pay attention to the post above mine"
