These two short video clips, downloaded from the website www.10641.com (where they may or may not still be available), purport to be excerpts from a longer video of the harsh interrogation of a prisoner at an undisclosed location. "10641" is the number painted on the back of the prisoner's shirt. The interrogator speaks English with an American accent. The prisoner is not heard speaking in this video, but according to the webmaster of www.10641.com, who claims to have received the video on a DVD anonymously mailed, the prisoner is also American.
