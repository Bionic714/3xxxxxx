It's the official ""1969"" live with added crowdnoise between the tracks....."

,dyngapa,2006-04-17T19:45Z,"really, wow what a rip off, acually no. i will decide when i hear it"
,mg196,2007-10-31T18:11Z,"This is NOT ""Retinal Circus.""  Deckarep is correct."
,dshibler,2008-02-20T18:10Z,"This is great, thanx, didn't know about it"
,g500,2008-03-30T13:39Z,"A complete FAKE. As dekarep is pointing out this is the Live 1969. BTW Waldo Jefferson (the one posting this torrent) is the character of The Gift song in the album White light/ White heat:

""?right through the center of Waldo Jefferson?s head, which split slightly and caused little rythmic arcs of red to pulsate gently in the morning sun.?"
