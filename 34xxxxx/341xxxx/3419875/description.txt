The Retinal Circus was a venue in Vancouver, B.C. that hosted concerts by the likes of Cream,
The Byrds, et al. The Velvet Underground played there several times and were well liked there.
The last time they played there would have been at the end of their '69 tour.
That said, there is speculation that this recording comes from The Eagle Theater in Seattle.
The Eagle had its own in-house recording system and recorded most shows there for potential
radio broadcasts. The Velvets would have shared the bill with one or two other big acts, and
played for a larger audience than usual. Most of the original Eagle Theater reels were bought 
by a collector in the mid 1970's and have only begun to circulate in recent years.
The source for this is a Maxell XL II cassette made from a large 15ips reel. The cassette is
at least 15 years old but has held up pretty well.
It is not known if this show was ever broadcast.
