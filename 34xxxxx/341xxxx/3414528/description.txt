Notes
-----

With "Chemistry" Sarah, Nicola, Nadine, Kimberley and Cheryl
have made a quirky British pop album. In a genre where girl
bands dream of being Destiny?s Vogue, Girls Aloud have made
an album that reflects what it?s like to be a 20-something
girl living in the UK.

There?s attitude ("Models), there?s heartbreak
("Whole Lotta History"), there?s sauciness ("Watch Me Go").
Make no mistake this is a 24-carot solid gold pop album but
thrown into the mix are snatches of rock, house, electro,
salsa, rap and ska. The album has been made by breaking the
rules on what you can do with pop. Who said you can?t have
two choruses in one song or three different sounds in another?

Chemistry also features the new hit single "Biology" and the
forthcoming Christmas single "See The Day" as well as their
summer smash "Long Hot Summer".
