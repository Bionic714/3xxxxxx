Description: Zampano is an unmannered and brutish strongman travelling the Italian countryside and performing at fairs and carnivals to earn his bread. Faithful and sensitive Gelsomina follows him and acts both as his sidekick and wife. Eventually they join with a circus and meet Matto, a playful and kind clown and rope-walker, who ridicules Zampano and offers Gelsomina a way out of his opressive hold on her. Zampano's rugged and aggressive character will however lead to a series of tragic events. Fellini directs a melancholic parable on the nature of man that has remained as one of his best films and a monumental work of the post-war Italian neo-realism wave.
