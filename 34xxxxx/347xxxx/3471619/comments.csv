,ShAQ2000,2006-04-17T20:16Z,"tdia, what kind of processor do you have? have you enabled all 'filters' in a third party app like ffdshow? If so try disabling some (e.g. the postprocessing filter). The codec is great but needs a cpu with at least 1 ghz or more. And aren't we already have such a CPU like that?!"
