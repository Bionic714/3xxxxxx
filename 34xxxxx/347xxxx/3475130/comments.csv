,imiker,2007-05-23T20:25Z,"HI, do you have this for mac?"
,m2thedeep,2007-06-06T00:26Z,"Fxpansion isn't on Mac currently, atleast I don't think it is. And for anyone looking for BFD Deluxe, it's on newgroups right now."
,ultramegaclay,2007-06-27T16:57Z,thank you for putting this up.  I have like 8 gigs of kits for bfd if anyone if interested
,mrdazobee,2007-06-27T17:15Z,"Help! When I try to install this it comes up with the message""Please insert BFD install DVD 1 files to continue"" Any ideas??"
,hawaiiandisco,2007-07-15T13:31Z,It would be great if someone could seed the samplepacks. 
,gb_spectre,2007-08-11T05:10Z,"Getting the ""Please insert BFD install DVD 1 files to continue"" message during install.... any help greatly appreciated!!"
,Rycon,2007-11-13T15:15Z,"Well this is defently legit, but it asks for DVD 1 about halfway through, which i think is a sound disc that contains a ton of instruments. Whats weird is that it installs a bunch of sounds already but once you cancel the DVD it basically marks c:\program files\BFD as fake, but the files are still there, once you start BFD it wont find the bfd directory it installed. So you can look at all these awesome drums but they wont make any sounds. The instructions say nothing about it, theres a crack and keygen included, but there basically useless without a complete install. Theres no images or data files, just a standalone .exe

If anybody could help me out it would be greatly appreciated."
,xeode,2008-02-16T20:06Z,"if you press cancel when asked for the DVD of the kits the instalation continues without. i cant find any working kit packs out there, all the ones on mininova seem to be corrupted.

can someone PLEASE UPLOAD SOME KIT PACKS

thanks"

,mm4free,2008-04-15T08:03Z,Why are there no kits w/ this? Has anyone got this working w/out a default kit or any?- ultramegaclay...be a hero and start a torrent. Found DVD2 at isohunt but was just the drum samples..no kits. Probably a joke from FXPansion.
