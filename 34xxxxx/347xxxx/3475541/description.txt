This is a copy of the other torrent, however it messed up for some reason...

Yes I know there is already a torrent, but it's soooo large, it goes sooooo  sloooowww. I figured it'd be nice to get all the stuff, so it doesn't fade. I have utorrent, so seeding will be easy(uses little memory), but I don't check here much, so send seed requests to:
madsci78   @   hotmail.com  , remove the spaces.
