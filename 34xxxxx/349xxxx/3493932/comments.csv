,phuq,2006-06-09T21:24Z,"are you really, truly.. seeding?"
,LeRoiCR,2006-06-10T02:56Z,"Yes, I Seed whenever I upload a torrent file.  I've already uploaded 77.2 MB.  Hope you like the All In One, and Happy Downloading!!

Open to any comments about workmanship, or opinions about the All In One.

Just thought I'd add a note before some spamming rejects make some comments about viruses, spies, trojans, worms, addware, or any other ideas of malicious code.  The Note:  THIS ALL IN ONE IS ABSOLUTELY CLEAN IN EVERY MANNER OF MALICIOUS CODE.  I only Share stuff to keep the act of Sharing Alive.  That obviously means ONLY clean, handy, and stuff that's usually hard to get.  I hope everyone enjoys this release.  I'll have others up here and at other sites."
,lordxyzzy,2006-06-20T04:09Z,I think the person asking if you're seeding this is asking if your firewall/ISP isn't preventing access to your torrent client.
,LeRoiCR,2006-06-20T13:40Z,"Well, actually, I'm hidden behind plenty of protection.  But that isn't stopping or restricting access to my active torrent client.  My client has full permissions to access the internet and all the proper port ranges.  The TPB Server is using old code and even with the complicated newer code, the TPB Server seems to be a little slow.  I guess you'll have that when you're the Biggest and Largest Bittorrent Tracker in the World with so much traffic.  Especially when I did a search for my All In One, and to my surprise it has landed on just about every major Torrent Site out there with plenty of people trying to download, which that doesn't help matters.  Only because the ratio of Seeders/Downloaders is 1 S:150 D.  Hate to sound like a crybaby but, we need Seeders.  If you would like to help the cause, then Seed after your download succeeds.  Although your right about the connectivity being slow.  Although if you just started your download, just be patient it will take off eventually.  The best things come to those who wait."
,skilssi,2006-07-11T08:11Z,someone seed please. im at 96%
,siggs,2006-07-25T17:50Z,Seed
,LeRoiCR,2006-07-26T16:08Z,"I am seeding, I've been seeding.  Someone else is also seeding.  If you know already that everything on your end works fine (client, computer, firewalls, and Internet), then just wait a while.  Sometimes you have to wait a while before the download starts.  If you're at the very end 99%, clients like to hang there for a while.  Don't worry about any LeRoiCR torrents.  They will download 100%.  It's also a good idea after the download succeeds to close out after seeding for a while, at least the size of the download, and reopen the download to verify that your client really didn't skip anything.  Sometimes but not often, that will happen.  Happy Downloading!!!"
,Bennie,2006-09-04T17:57Z,"Hm I downloaded it, but installer started unpack and crashed and again and again. It could be uncompressed manually but is password protected :((( useless"
,LeRoiCR,2006-09-05T14:01Z,"Funny that of the hundreds that downloaded it on various torrent sites all over the world, I know -- I looked it up, you're the only one that claims it doesn't work.  I took 3 days in the creation of this, and guaranteed tested it thoroghly -- that is on my desktop system, laptop system, and a virtual system, and believe me and all the other hundreds, it does most certainly work, and great.  I will, however, admit that I forgot to include the Construction Set.  I'm busy with various projects and currently have another release of this project going.  It will include the Construction Set, as well as, all of the Official Plugins for the game.  Try to figure out what your problem is, and happy downloading.  You could also wait if you want to have a more complete All In One of TESIII.  Or yah, the thing was never meant to be uncompressed manually with any program.  I've encrypted the project to protect my work and the work of Bethesda."
,LeRoiCR,2006-09-09T22:04Z,"Dear aki1996 & Bennie,
        The Elder Scrolls III - All In One was NEVER meant to be uncompressed.  It is encrypted, hence the password prompt.  I don't understand why people just can't be a user, and double-click on files.  It is an .exe and therefor should just execute like any other .exe file.  If one questions the safety of this file, or for any other, then Don't Download it/them.  I know the All In One is guaranteed safe in terms of all malicious code and or threats of any kind.  I also know that the All In One works 100%, too.  For those that want to know about some ""Missing Password"", get a clue, and treat files as they were intended.  All other requests for missing passwords will be ignored.  Be Real or Be Square!!!  And for all the other individuals out there who need help, email me at LeRoiCR@gmail.com.  Happy Downloading to ALL!!!"
,streetfightern,2006-09-16T19:44Z,"Hi!, LeRoiCR
i have extracted it and installed everything but cant launch it without the CD. How do i do?
can only launch the install shit not the game.
i need to know how plz!!! N.O.S"
,zeroxccba696,2006-09-18T12:04Z,"What exactly do you mean by ""interactive map""?"
,LeRoiCR,2006-09-19T22:40Z,"First, I'd like to say that I've been real busy lately, and Second, I'd like to say sorry to the people who had a hard time with the install steps.  I thought that they will real clear, but anyways, here is how one goes about the installation:

1)  Install Morrowind
2)  Install Tribunal
3)  Install Tribunal Update
4)  Install Bloodmoon
5)  Install Bloodmoon Update
6)  Install the missing Videos with the Videos button under ""Bloodmoon"".
7)  Install the ""Bloodmoon No-CD""

If one follows the exact above, one will end up with the equivalent to the GOTY Edition of The Elder Scrolls III

The ""Interactive Map"" is a third party program that is useful in conjuction with TES III, by helping the player keep track as to where things are in the game and where they are in the game.

The Interactive Map is a standalone program.  So you'll have to switch between the game and the Map by either pressing the [Windows] Key or Ctrl+Alt+Del, and then use the Map and then clicking back on the game which is now on the taskbar.

Hope that helps those having trouble or questions!!!  Happy Downloading, and enjoy!!!"

,heL1x,2006-10-16T21:36Z,"Well im downloading right now, when it gets done... do I need to download anything else to make these work if people do say they need a cd or whatever to make it work?"

,heL1x,2006-10-16T21:51Z,anyone seeding or have finished seeding?
,LeRoiCR,2006-10-17T06:18Z,"For those who actually take the time to read comments (and instructions), I thought I'd add one final comment about this All In One; ""The Elder Scrolls III - All In One by LeRoiCR"" ABSOLUTELY 100% works.  The people who have made comments suggesting that it doesn't work (e.x. password, no cd failure) are either doing something with the All In One that they should be doing, they themselves don't know how to follow directions exactly, or their systems have issues which are beyond the scope of this All In One.  This All In One like any other program is written with properly working systems in mind.  I don't know how to make any clearer other than it has been a thoroughly tested as much as possible to assure that there are no issues with it.  So, if you're wondering if it works, yes it does.  And a reminder, even though I am extremely busy, and do these things in spare time, I am working on a new TESIII All In One which will include the Construction Set, as well as All of the Official Plugins for TESIII.  Happy Downloading and Enjoy!!!  Don't forget to feed the cause and seed after downloading.  If it weren't for the seeders and of course the trackers, leachers woudn't be downloading anything.  So remember that, and seed afterwards!!!"
,pmmnop,2006-11-21T06:22Z,"Hey I'm trying to download this, but it's getting really annoying because seeders come in for about 10 seconds and then leave, so I'm still at 5% after 6 hours. PLEASE SEED"
,XenoSphere,2006-11-24T01:54Z,Just goto www.gamecopyworld.com if it doesn't work.
,turboginsu,2006-11-24T01:58Z,"leroicr you shouldn't be posting torrents, and you shouldn't be reproducing either, judging by comments on your other posts, you're batting 1000 at suck. it's hilarious that you take an opportunity to show off your mad winzip/shockwave skill like the uber leetzor you are -- only to be proven an idiot, maybe you should just be a user and post the files just like you spidered someone elses cracks. too funny that you try to treat everyone like an idiot that can't apply patches and wind up with tons of people seeding a crap torrent. 

for those of you that have a computer made in the last 3 years you'll need to disable XD in the bios (if possible) and then burn/mount the image before copying it to your drive to execute it. wow that's way simpler than some isos and patches isn't it?

g/j again leroicr

if anyone is looking for a good laugh i'd recommend this site

,LeRoiCR,2006-11-24T09:44Z,"Just thought I'd respond directly to the Complete A**hole ""turboginsu"".  First I'd like to say that you must be a complete piece of sh** to make such an immature comment to a totally working absolutely awesome release of TES III.  I've been using computers since I was a young kid, obviously before you're time!, and since that time, have only uploaded about 5 times.  I'm assuming that you are referring to MY ""Broken XP Pro Patch"".  You're right about it.  It is broken, and hence no positive defensive comments from myself about it.  I forgot to test it thorougly before it's release.  This file however is completely working.  I know, I made it, tested it, and used it repeatedly.  My site that you've been so immature and an a**hole to post to is obviously not finished.  It is a project like many others.  Out of my releases/projects, I've only had 1 failure.  I think illegal ungrateful sh*t talking people like yourself won't last too long online.  Where's your personal releases?  Funny this thing has been downloaded more times than you've made crappy comments.  You're also wrong about shockwave/winzip; never used in this project.  Or yeah, you and the REAL IDIOTS are also a minority.  I also thought I'd let you know that I was trained directly by the government, and have also built my own computer.  It's a hybrid, which also works better than most things you'll ever see!  People this file absolutely works if you're computer absolutely works.  Now I really don't have any more time for rejects or people making a**holish comments.  For those of you that appreciate it, ""Your Welcome!""  Happy Downloading and Enjoy!!!"
,pmmnop,2006-11-25T02:32Z,"i finally downloaded it and got everything to work out, it works if you do exactly what LeRoiCR says to do. and i didnt have to download any patches, burn/mount images (whatever that is), change system files, or anything like that, i just did the 7 steps what he said and it works perfectly.

I got the morrowind burned on a cd, and when I instaled that I was able to run the game, until I was going out of the boat at the beginning of the game, than it crashed, so I downloaded ur torrent and installed it at the exact same way that u told, when I run it, I get to the intro, and than it crash, the reason of that is because I dont got sound on my pc. My question is, why doesnt it work without the sound on ur morrowind but it allmost does with the one I got from before..can u please help me with that? anyways, great torrent"

Ok, i've downloaded many a games from here

and I've always had the same problem.

I try and mount the ISO image with daemon tool...and it always says "" Please isnert disk "" or whatever. I know this is to do with disk protection like securom and that. 

***Ok...leroicr...dont flame me just because I can't do something or dont know something***

Im just wondering...does this file have ISO images of the games?

I dont understand it yet from the comments.

the seven step thing shows nothing of ISO images of the games.

So please, enlighten me. Are there ISO images of the cds... if so, what should I use since daemon tool doesnt work if the game has securom on it.

Extreme resource hog, maybe 2GB physical ram and 4GB swap are not enough?  Maybe extreme processor usage killed my CPU?

1) Morrowind
2) Morrowind Video Files
3) Tribunal Exp.
4) Tribunal Update
5) Tribunal Video Files
6) Bloodmoon Exp.
7) Bloodmoon Update
8) Bloodmoon Video Files
9) Bloodmoon NoCD
10) Extras - Interactive Map

Only other difference, location/name of ISO.  Before, buried in a long path name.  After, very short and sweet C:\temp\TES3AIO.iso .  Using Daemon-Tools v4.30.1.  And also different, before, DT all emulation options on; after - all off.
