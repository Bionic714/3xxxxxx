Here is an All In One of The Elder Scrolls III:  Morrowind.  This puppy allows for you to install Morrowind, Tribunal, Bloodmoon, all updates, and no cd your favorite version.  It has a nice interface which I built myself.  I was uploading when the server went down.  Now I'll try to upload again.  This is pretty much the same as the GOTY edition of Morrowind.  Which can be found at the official site of the manufacturing company.  Mine's better though, cuz it's free, and has the no cd crack and the interactive map.

Here are two reminders, please read the nfo with notepad, and here are the links to the pictures I made of it, so you can check it out a little, and obviously it's not the same thing as the "Complete" edition you see out there available.

It's a little more complete, and better looking than that one.  Although that one did give me an idea to start work on one.  I'll be releasing others available here and on other torrent sites.

Hope you like the quality and handiness of this All In One.
