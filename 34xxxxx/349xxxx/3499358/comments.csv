,miman2,2006-06-30T00:23Z,"And what kind of archiving program do you need to unpack the files, neither stuffit or unrar does the trick..."
,modaset,2006-06-30T01:37Z,"It's are already unpacked, try to play the files with vlc"

,bit_after_bit,2006-06-30T23:41Z,"sorry to ask this but ... is it an upscaled version ?
because it doesn't seem to be a real 1080. it's not a sharp, precise, detailed image as you expect from a HD file."
,choummasone,2006-07-03T14:22Z,how can i pack it up?? wish program i have to use it??
,Chuck Nrs,2006-10-02T01:15Z,Please seed! Feel like I'm the only one doing that on this file... My upload speed is constantly 10 times faster than my download speed!!!:(
,Daddy_Spank,2006-10-04T08:18Z,there are some serious interlacing problems on this one.... unfortunatly.
,zalsson,2006-10-23T22:11Z,Om vi skulle försöka och få lite fart på denna torrent?
,jasong,2007-01-04T15:52Z,This is an upscaled version.  NOT HIDEF.
,xiIix,2007-12-19T16:21Z,We need an HDDVD/Bluray rip of this ASAP!!! I'm sick of this one.
,DolphWulff,2008-04-09T22:45Z,"FUCK THIS CRAPPY RELEASE - THIS MAY BE TAKEN FROM A HDTV CHANNEL, BUT IT'S DVD RESOLUTION AT BEST. IT LOOKS WORSE THAN A DVD RIP. STOP SEEDING THIS, FIND SOME OTHER RELEASE (NOT THE NHANC3 ONE, THAT BLOWS ASS TOO) "
,Vadim Makarov,2008-09-02T23:14Z,"1. It does not look like HDTV resolution. Not even quite a DVD quality: DVDs (usually) do not have ugly sharpening fringes.

2. What a sick joke to butcher it into 100 KB files? The player stutters at every file change. I've had to use the splitting tool mentioned in earlier comment."
