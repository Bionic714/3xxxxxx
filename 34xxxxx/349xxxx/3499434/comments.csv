Konstigt, inga rarfilsändelser och de namnlösa filerna börjar på 26?"

,andyfox01,2006-07-24T11:03Z,"A few people are having problems with this but all i did was....
1)open BI2 file directory.
2)right click first file with winrar.
3)all other files will open automatically.
4)DVD image appears.
5)copy/paste or drag image to dvd shrink."
,Hebbe84,2006-08-08T22:30Z,I really don´t get this... the files I´ve downloaded aren´t of any filetype it´s just numbers. I guess they´re supposed to be rar files but they´re not. If anyone knows what´s wrong please tell me what to do
,rjh1979,2006-08-28T15:41Z,"Works fine - open with winrar. It doesn´t recognice it as a winrar file to begin with, but just right-click the file, choose ""open with"" and then choose winrar. Then it creates an image file you can burn - no problem....."
,TheRealMatix,2006-09-16T21:08Z,have romanian subtitle?
,tee_m,2007-07-11T23:49Z,"you must just open the .001 file with winrar.. and unpack.
'open with' -> winrar "
