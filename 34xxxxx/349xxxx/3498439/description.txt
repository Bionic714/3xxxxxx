Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic II PCDVD

Format: ISO
ISO Size: 2.47GB

I converted the 4CD version to DVD and have fully tested it.
Latest Patch and Crack are included in a folder in the ISO.
Covers (both CD & DVD format) are also in the same folder.

Installation:
1) Burn or Mount ISO
2) Install game
*note* At the end of installation the setup will ask for the Play disc just clic OK
          and the setup will finish (it won\'t affect anything, everything is installed)
3) Update game with 1.0b patch located in \'Patch - Crack - Cover\' folder
4) Replace .exe with the one from \'Patch - Crack - Cover\' folder
5) Play the game!

Enjoy!
