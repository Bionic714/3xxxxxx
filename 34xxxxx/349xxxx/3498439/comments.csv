,adey1986,2006-08-07T12:03Z,I have downloaded all of the files but my question is this: Do i have to extract the iso's from the winrar application to mount the game?
,MoFoKeR,2006-08-31T06:59Z,i have the same question as adey...we have to unrar the whole file?
,Hdlsa,2006-09-07T21:22Z,Where do I find the crack and patch?
,kjduncan,2006-10-01T14:56Z,"You only hve to extract one file, and use the iso within it."

,Gnorbatshov,2006-10-03T14:09Z,"Wont work. CRC errors in .part9 & .part53

If someone managed to unrar them properly please comment."
,TheMajor,2006-10-05T00:59Z,"WHAT?! 53 files?

I ONLY HAVE FUCKING NINE! NINE?

It said it downloaded completely.

And I can't get anything to unzip, I've tried two different programs,  WinAce, and UnzipThemAll.


Maybe it's because i only have 9 of the 53 files? Is this working for anyone else?"
,TheMajor,2006-10-05T01:40Z,"Sorry for teh drama people! Apparently, the 53 files  simply took a long time for Shareaza to recompile (after the actual download) into the correct folder.

All 53 were compiled, and WinAce made short work of them.

Along with Virtual CD, the game is now installing. It is actually working. Haven't got it installed fully yet, so no play. So I don't know how FAR it works.

It's simple to unzip. If you're unzipper is worth its salt, once the files are all accounted for, unzipping one will unzip them all into the single iso."
,Gnorbatshov,2006-10-05T12:22Z,Downloaded Winace 2.65 shareware. (used winrar before) Winrar found those errors but Winace just crashes when i try to extract them. Any suggestions?
,Gnorbatshov,2006-10-07T19:38Z,bah... downloaded this torrent again. now it has about 15 CRC errors in different parts... quessing it just wont work. :S
,Rendrag,2006-10-11T09:49Z,"I've installed the game through mounting the ISO, but whenever I attempt to start it, it says that I have the wrong disc in the drive.  Has anyone else had this problem, and if so, how do I get by it? "
,Rendrag,2006-10-12T05:11Z,"Boy, do I feel stupid...

Okay.  So to get by the ordeal I described above, you have to right click on the image of the disc located in My Computer (after you mount the iso, of course) and click ""open"" not ""autorun.""  In the file that opens there should be a folder labeled ""Patch - Crack - Cover.""  From there, just follow the instructions given at the top of this webpage.

Boy, do I feel stupid..."

,Merc89,2006-11-27T05:38Z,"I recently finished dl the game, and upon playing it I found that it well... sucked. It may just be my computer, or how I'm doing it, but I can't play ANY video, and when I finish creating my character the game crashes.

,darkone6984,2006-11-28T23:59Z,"Ok call me a noob if you like but im lost.

Any advice?"
,Berlock,2006-12-04T05:15Z,"Great Torrent. Did not have one problem with it at all. I have beaten the game on every difficulty and on each side of the Force. Glad I happened to look here for this game, as I had misplaced one of my CDs and could not reinstall. Just follow everything as he says and I guarantee there will be no problems.

Any chance on a release of the newest patch? If so, perhaps can you do it just single or remake this one with the newer patch and also have a seperate one just for patch? 

Thanks again mate, very appreciative of your work."

After mounting the image, you have to explore the ""Emulated DVD"" drive and copy paste the crack and patch from there. Just a piece of advice for the other would be dumbasses out there."
,chas69,2006-12-12T19:11Z,"thanks patrisyo69 it helped:) but now i have other problem:P i play the game, having fun, when suddenly the monitor goes black(the light at the monitor changes from green to orange) and i have to restart the computer... is it mabye something with processor? anybody knows whats happening?:P   "

I can see alot of you are pissed of with all this hassel and downloading for ever and getting no results well, Here you go, basicly do this

1.) Download This Torrent(S)

2.) Burn The ISO To A DVD (Or just extract the iso and paste the files onto the blank dvd)

3.) Eject your newly burnt disc

4.) Then Put Your Newly Burnt disc back in the DVD Drive

5.) It should auto run or if it does not click start click on 'My Computer'

6.) A new window will pop up and just click the D:\ one with a KOTOR2 face of Nihilus on it 

7.) It should load up just exit it

8.) now it start click run and type in C:\Program Files\SWKotor2\

9.) It should bring up the Kotor directory if not dudes find it and click on launcher.exe

10.) if it crash's and says Kotor has encountered a problem then your screwed >:P

11.) Just Kidding

12.) In the installation folder C:\Program Files\SWKOTOR2\ there should be a folder with a crack in it right click it copy it 

13.) go back to C:\Program Files\SWKOTOR2\ and right click and paste it, it should auto- overwrite the egsiting file anywho

14.) Click the .exe file and enjoy a 100% CLEAN GAME.

15.) NOTE: if this does not work please, PLEASE,
leave a comment on here i will get back to u about it, becoz alot of people have done this and its worked like a charm so if u have any further queryies need help or seek advice (relating to KOTOR1-2) leave a comment here 

CHOW!!!"

,Darkstar81,2009-08-16T17:28Z,2 those still havin problems with vista: try downloading driver genious pro from piratebay n update drivers it should sort those compatibilty issues
,Darkstar81,2009-08-16T17:30Z,this vista fix also made no difference what so ever

,Jmuerte,2009-08-23T23:47Z,Wtf do I do with all the .rar files in the torrent???
,Cdubz_walMart,2009-10-10T16:53Z,what's the best app. to mount the .iso????

,daevlol,2009-11-08T21:01Z,"can confirm this works on windows 7. installed, patched, did no cd crack and ran game with 0 issues. good torrent"
,sinatuubapaska,2009-11-16T13:47Z,Great torrent! Thank you!
,MrBlu,2010-03-22T00:34Z,"Hey the installation worked great, but the game is playing wayyy to fast. do you know why that might be?"
,MrBlu,2010-03-22T01:07Z,It's also displaying things wrong and locking up in the prologue after maybe 7-8 steps
,Kratonis,2010-10-13T05:50Z,"Hey guys I think I found out why it crashes after intro. Ive never been able to get it to work but I came across something today called the intel chipset family fix. I have an intel chipset video card, and i guess it has compatibility issues. Just google the fix..."
,sto11just,2010-11-04T00:37Z,"Hey all,

I downloaded this game, and it gives me the ""KoTOR has stopped working"" bit. anyone know how to get past this. it happens after character select and before i can actually get in game. im runnign 7 yet tried the vista patch (http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4990017/Kotor_2_Vista_Fix) that references this original torrent. help is much appreciated, i love this game. 

email: sto11just@gmail.com"
,kindaswe,2011-03-01T12:25Z,"I think i might have solved the solution for the game crashes right after the first intro cinematic.

First you need to start the game as usual, and anytime while the game is running, Alt+Tab and press CTRL+Shift+ ESC, Find the SwKotor.exe process and right click it, ""Set affinity"" and uncheck one of the processors. This should set the game straight for you guys! Enjoy the game!"
,kindaswe,2011-03-01T12:53Z,"EDIT: This will only work for Vista users, since Windows 7 automaticly sets the game to use only 1 core when you have set ""run in Windows xp (SP2)"" compability, but also i found a great guide for Windows 7 users to get this game to work here: http://www.lucasforums.com/showthread.php?t=194296

Good luck!"
,KernelSanders93,2011-03-14T02:04Z,So I downloaded this torrent and used 7-Zip file manager to extract the first rar file within this torrent. it then of course turned into an iso file so i mounted it using Deamon tools. once the window popped up and asked to either autoplay it (pretty much means run it or install it) or open files to view whats in side and i click autoplay Nothing Happens! Ive tried everything and it just will not start up. If i can get the installed i can easily crack it and get it running myself. Could someone please help me on this matter? It would be very well appreciated. Other than that its a good download. Thanks for the Help guys
,Bashilaski,2011-03-14T03:11Z,"So, I did everything instructed but every time i open it it crashes. You know the thing where it's like 'send error report' or 'don't send'        can anyone help me?"
,iMarlon,2011-04-18T09:41Z,works fine but got some issues with the character creater makes a character and then gives me blackscreen anyone have a fix ? ( windows 7 )
,TheThreeLaws,2011-04-24T04:39Z,"I'm having issues with the final bit. I've got it downloaded, installed, mounted, updated, and the affinity and  Compatibility all set up, but the exe in the patch-crack-cover folder isn't there. There's a .rar file that won't extract and the update, plus three images, but when I go to extract the .rar, which says NoCD so I assume it's the crack, I get an ""access is denied"" message"
,Monehan,2011-06-24T06:51Z,"the game installed perfectly cept when i go to play the game i mount the ISO appropriately named KOTOR2_PCDVD ISO on daemon, and click on the game link. when i attempt to launch the game it gives me please insert correct cd/dvd. WUT DO
