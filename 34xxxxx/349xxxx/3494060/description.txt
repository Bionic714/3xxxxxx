This is a recording of a speech given by Howard Zinn at the 
University of Vermont on Oct. 21, 2001. It was aired by 
Democracy Now! on the 22nd.  The source was a Real Audio 
broadcast from the archives of webactive.com.  Yeah, yeah, I 
know.  This is freely available over the web.  But how many 
of you have never heard of webactive.com or Democracy Now!? 
Holding to my nym, I think this is something that deserves a 
broader audience.

The following is from a blurb at freespeech.org.

"Howard Zinn, noted historian and author of A Peoples' History of 
the United States examines the corruption of the political 
processes in the United States that has turned the US Congress 
into Soviet style parliament, the corporate media into official 
government spokesmen, and stripped the people of access to 
information and representation in the string of undeclared wars 
the US has fought from Vietnam to Somalia to Afghanistan."
