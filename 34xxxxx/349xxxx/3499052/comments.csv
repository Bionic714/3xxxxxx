I get kernel panic.
My box:
AMD Athlon-xp
MB Asus with Via chipset
1 GB mem
I burned the dvd with gnomebaker which uses the dd command to burn the image.
I am using Gentoo Linux,which works quite well,I think I'll just forget about MacOSX.
This was my 5th dvd that didn't wanna start.
The others gave me either kernel panic or /com.apple.Boot.plist not found."
