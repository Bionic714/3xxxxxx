Teaser trailer of the upcoming Spider-Man 3 movie starring:

Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker/Spider-Man
Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane Watson
James Franco as Harry Osborn/Green Goblin
Thomas Haden Church as Flint Marko/Sandman
...and Topher Grace as... VENOM!

This is from the High-Def source (1920x912), remixed to half resolution (960x456).  Should still be enough for everyone.  Also, I re-encoded it to XVID (2-pass) because, frankly, Sorenson sucks.

If you really want the HD version of the Spiderman trailer, feel free to download the 124 MB file from Apple.  Have fun trying to share it with anyone, though.
