,asands1,2009-02-02T21:48Z,"very good series.  The prof doesn't just recount history but also the ideas from russian poets, authors and even the common epople that made Russia what it is.  One thing I appreciate about lectures from TTC is that the professors generally put the history in its original narrative context and not just recounting history through a Western views.  ive listened to this TTC lecture series twice.  higly recommended"

,IGotDMCA,2010-02-01T11:22Z,I strongly recommend people not share this. I got a DMCA letter from them. They will enforce protection of their copyrights. Their stuff is high quality but I chose to delete it all after I got the letter.
