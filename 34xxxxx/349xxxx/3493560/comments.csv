,stafleR,2006-07-27T19:21Z,please seed. great show.
,Furazela,2006-07-29T07:47Z,This torrent have had constant seeds since it was uploaded. Don't trust TPB statistics!
,stafleR,2006-07-29T17:00Z,yeah i know but the speed was bad until this day:) im gonna upload forever because roswell rocks :)
,Furazela,2006-08-07T22:26Z,"I can't guarante speed, as I'm seeding more than just Roswell. In fact I'm speed-limiting each Roswell Season to 60 KiB/s (as I do with all torents with a ratio of 50:1 or more).
The idea is to guarante that the torrent doesn't die, but leave propagation to others, and use my bandwidth to other, more recent, torrents."
[V],Ole-The-Dude,2006-12-22T14:47Z,"Would be great if someone kept seeding this. At least untill I'm done. I always seed a torrent for, at least, a month. Roswell Season 3, I was seeding 23.058 ;)"
