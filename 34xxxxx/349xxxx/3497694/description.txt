-What would you have done if you had been given absolute power of life and death over everybody else in the whole world?

-The most controversial film of the twentieth century has just become the most controversial film of the twenty first century.

Plot Summary: The rise and fall of the notorious Roman Emperor Caligula, showing the violent methods that he employs to gain the throne, and the subsequent insanity of his reign - he gives his horse political office and humiliates and executes anyone who even slightly displeases him. He also sleeps with his sister, organises elaborate orgies and embarks on a fruitless invasion of England before meeting an appropriate end. There are various versions of the film, ranging from the heavily- truncated 90-minute version to the legendary 160-minute hardcore version which leaves nothing to the imagination (though the hardcore scenes were inserted later and do not involve the main cast members).

Trivia: John Gielgud was originally offered the role of Tiberius, but declined: he only accepted the smaller part of Nerva after being sent a letter by Gore Vidal. (more)

Goofs: Factual errors: Charea is shown proclaiming Claudius emperor after killing Caligula and his family. In reality, it was another Praetorian who proclaimed Claudius as emperor - Charea had been planning on killing Claudius as well to eliminate the entire imperial family. (more)

Quotes:
[Caligula is having a nightmare about Tiberius]
Tiberius: A brother kills a brother who's killed his father who's killed his son. Fate. And then someone will kill Caligula!

There are other copies of this movie on this server.  Either it was a very slow transfer, no transfer at all, or not as good of quality as I wanted.  I don't know which version this.  I do know that this is about 1:19:35 in length and is not from the U.S. since it is 25 FPS, so that kind of helps narrow it down.  See the list above of runtimes.
