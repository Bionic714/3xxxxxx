,wwefan,2006-07-01T20:51Z,people that got the movie weren't seeding all that well so I'm back again and I'll seed for a while with 70 KB/s upstream.
,exapplerep,2006-07-05T03:28Z,The worst film ever foisted on the public. Makes Pink Flamingos look like an Academy Award winner. Avoid this like the plague.
,wwefan,2006-07-08T02:21Z,I meant to say this is 149 minutes & 36 seconds in 3 files.
[T],WinstonSmith6079,2007-01-09T05:33Z,"So is this the original, ""unrated"" version, the ""R""-rated version, or some other version?  ???"
,DragenDK,2007-07-14T20:14Z,Is it only me who doesnt get any sound on this movie ??? Plz help me get that....

,wwefan,2007-08-11T14:14Z,You need the AC3 codec.  Its here: http://ac3filter.net/project/1/releases  Remember to go into the settings and turn the volume up as high as it will go (or close to).
,wwefan,2007-08-11T14:15Z,This movie is fucking filthy!  That's why i uploaded it.  Hope you enjoy it too!

,xerxes1337,2007-10-18T21:58Z,"Ave.
This was probebly the worst movie ever.
I thougt it was going to be cool as every other movies about the great roman empire, but no it was 3 hours of nudity and vulgar clips.
here my warning and don't dowload it.
it had nothing to do with caligula as a person or his real psychological problems.

,ZMRADIO,2008-02-11T09:09Z,"So I am pretty sure this is the ""unrated"" version of this film. According to Wikipedia, ""The unrated version, available in the U.S. and mainland Europe, running 156 minutes (NTSC) and 150 minutes (PAL)."" Because this is the PAL version, the runtime listed by wwefan of 149 min and 36 sec would put it at the correct time for the unrated version. So I would assume this is the good one, but can anyone confirm with me on this?"
,bizzyb0t,2008-02-21T01:03Z,"Thanks for this film. A classic and one of my personal favorites. It's raunchy, sick, twisted and nasty as shit. Nudity galore, the sex scenes are great (this is the 'unedited' version). Excellent rip, again thanks for a great upload. "
,kabalizo,2008-03-18T21:03Z,best bit: when he deflowers a newlywed couple... both of them... gnarly...
,zeinabqureshi,2008-04-12T21:10Z,"Caligula wallowed in luxury (he holds the record for the largest rowing boats (ships?) ever built - 300 ft in length, etc. And when he was finally murdered, his family shared a gruesome fate as well. He was somewhat popular with the masses, though. But I don't think he had many 'emotional problems' while he lived. 
The Tinto Brass parts are good, the juicier bits (which are not so nasty) were added by the Penthouse man. Brass had intended this film to be as twisted as it could be.
Quality is great. This is the unedited version, is a bit shorter because it's 25 fps.
Great upload (tho' I'll never watch the film, have it on DVD), great work.`"
,catchow58,2009-01-11T17:56Z,"The worst movie ever made?  The only epic about to tell the unvarnished truth about ancient Rome?  All I can say for sure is that there is nothing else in the world like it.  Bob Guccione takes a faltering production with a staggering roster of A list talent and adds hardcore sex scenes.  If you want to see John Gielgud and cum shots in one place, this may be your only option.  (I haven't downloaded it yet, so this is based on the version I saw on VHS maybe 20 years ago."
,Tuttankhamun,2009-04-09T20:18Z,"I just started downloading this torrent and it's healthy. Download speed is 20-33 kB/s. 
That is important, cos i'm bored to wait until the dooms day comes like the one i got from iso hunt ! 
I keep my fingers crossed that someone below me commented that this XviD quality is exellent.
Thank you for sharing this Caligula, Wwefan !"
