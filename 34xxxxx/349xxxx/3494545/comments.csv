I'm seeding this one, and I assure you I see 5 seeds and ~50 leechers (TPB shows 0/0). So don't believe your eyes and go check peers yourself ;)"

If you already downloaded 1-26, you can place new in the same folder (see ReadMe.txt for details)."
,Minerva.TheGift,2007-11-14T18:47Z,"Thanks for the Torrent!  After downloading and unpacking (can't remember if they were in .zip or .rar) I ended up with folders for Volumes 1, 2, and 4-28.  Somehow, though, the subfolder numbers (chapters) don't have a gap, so I guess Volumes 1 and 2 also contained the chapters from volume 3...but I don't know that for sure.  Anyways, it all seems to be working well, though it was a bit of a pain to unpack.  I've read through the first chapter or two, and it works great :D
