Finally got it working again, 

Songs:
Jihad
Colours
Giving Ground
Finland red, Egypt white
Rain from heaven

Andrew Eldritch of The Sisters of Mercy Released this one in a hurry to prevent his former band members Wayne Hussey & Craig Adams from using the "sisters" name.

Not really a The Sisters of Mercy album, But "Giving ground" remains i the live set.

"Colours" and "Rain from heaven" together with "Giving ground" are some of the best stuff Andrew wrote.
