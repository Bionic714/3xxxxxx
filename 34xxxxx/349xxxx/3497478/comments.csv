,moglover,2007-06-17T13:19Z,"This isn't the REAL AXXO...

Bcz there isnt the aXXo Logo/trademark on this torrent.

The Quality isnt guaranteed here, with real aXXo torrent it's for sure the best quality"
,aces58,2007-07-27T23:56Z,"um... moglover, look at the the uploader... axxo... so how is it not him?"
,Fenix_OP,2008-04-18T18:35Z,"Axxo himself stopped uploading awhile ago, 'axxo-torrents' is just keeping his torrents alive."

,AriGold45,2012-08-17T15:54Z,"aXXo stopped uploading around 2008, but just because someone is posting his torrents it doesn't mean that they are crap quality or contain viruses.  LOOK AT THE PINK SKULL, IDIOT. It's not aXXo but it's a trusted uploader nonetheless"
