[V],Spoorkees75,2006-06-11T22:49Z,"It seems to me these patches don't work, or lead to the opposit, if no notification before, when applied to WinXP Corp versions.
And after patching I still cannot enter the WU site without validation which, of course, fails."
,PointlessName,2006-06-15T15:11Z,"Works ok, all I did was replace the legitcheckcontrol.dll in windows/system32 with the one in here.  

Thats all thats required to get windows update working  (no need to run any program in the archive).  

If your daft enough to of allowed the notification program to install then thats another story! ;-)"
