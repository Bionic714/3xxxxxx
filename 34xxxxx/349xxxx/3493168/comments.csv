,MickDagger,2006-09-25T17:43Z,"Thanks for continuing to seed.

As for Illustrator, who in their right mind would want that flaming mess?  No one serious.  Professionals have been using FreeHand for years.  These days you might consider switching to Inkscape in the future.

But Illustrator? Hahaha."
