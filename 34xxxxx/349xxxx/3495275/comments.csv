,homestudio54,2006-08-12T13:10Z,"Coming from aXXo, the quality is (always) great.  
However, please read the reviews at http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0370032/.

Watched it myself and was compelled enough to sign up at imdb.com to write a review about it.  It's a total waste of time and bandwidth."
,egofantastic,2006-08-20T15:33Z,DAMN this movie sucks...don´t waste youre time
,Hilighter,2006-09-17T11:09Z,"This is good looking action/sci-fi with artistically done fast combat scenes plus a great soundtrack. Lots of people die but not much blood or gore. 

It's no Matrix but it's worth seeing :)"
,xxrichiexx,2006-09-25T17:03Z,"I have a question. I am not so new to the torrents. but i dunno what i have changed.  i want to fix it back.

When i first started downloading torrents, i would click DOWNLOAD THIS TORRENT. and a box would pop up asking me to RUN OR SAVE. well i always used to save. so i could just double click on desktop when i wanted to seed at night. well then. I clicked RUN a few times. and i also think i put somewhere in there to do this every time.  But when its set up like that, I have to go to the actual torrent every time online to start running and seeding it again.  Can you help me figure where to change that setting back?   Now when i click download torrent. it auto goes past that part :)   ty ty ty  "

,asfbr,2009-07-31T07:54Z,"this is a perfect example of a big piece of smelly garbage. I can honestly say this is the worst film I've seen. And man, I've seen crap. Worst 100 minutes spent ever. 

Ok, maybe it's not that bad, it's just I've seen it right now I guess. It really sucks tho.

axxo is perfect as usual, but the movie is horrible. Please save your time and go look at axxo's torrents and dl something better."
,Nefertirix,2009-09-02T17:20Z,"Hi guys! 
I heared about this movie; everybody say it's awfull. 
I wonder: it is worst than Boa vs. Python? xD Because that was the worst film what I've ever saw."

,J_T03,2012-03-19T04:35Z,"Some weird thing issue occurred when I tried to view this in VLC in a resolution equal to about half my desktop (1920x1080). Keep in mind, I have the most up-to-date version of VLC.

The bottom half of the video was out of sync, and moved to the right of the regular position. I discovered this when I had first opened it to check the video.

It's weird because I've gotten aXXo rips before, and they've all been fine... To add to the weirdness, opening the video in Windows Media Player works just find... I'm stumped."
