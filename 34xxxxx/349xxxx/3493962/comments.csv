,XoSkeLLeT,2006-06-09T19:24Z,lol.... never heard about it b4..... but it sounds really cool =)
,Shylock,2006-06-10T05:33Z,"I hate playing beta's. you have problems with game play sometimes, and then when you get tired of it, the real game come out and you don't wanna have to replay all the old stuff and it's boring. cool of you to bring it though, but I'll pass."
,Snakebyte99,2006-06-10T19:37Z,Seed plz! Whats the use if u dont seed the whole thing?
[T],Knaster,2006-06-11T00:18Z,This has been uploaded here earlier a very cool game. There are also some fixes out there somewhere  that fixes the subtitles. If you like Pirate games u should try this one. I6t's almost complete too if you apply the patch that is also out there.
,Doffeh,2006-06-11T03:14Z,"Is this any different from the previous torrent, or the same thing? No changes in the texting oor? "
[T],Knaster,2006-06-12T04:52Z,Use Luke_Perry's uploaded files (mini image and patch) and it will work
,tompa9000,2006-06-13T15:31Z,"HEY! seed! if you seed this game, someone else can seed it when they are finished. But noone else can seed, if they don't have the game 100 %...so seed!"

So I found a .rar-version on isohunt
But it seems that it's all in russian.
Does anyone know if this version is all russian too? or is there a way to shange into english?"
,bci,2006-06-26T13:38Z,"This looks orchestrated! Once we are finished the game will be out. PR related or what? I just dont get it. Maybe the industry is getting its revenge? Tons of frustrated pirates, ha ha just you wait."
[T],Knaster,2006-06-27T12:10Z,As i've said before luke_perry has uploaded several fixes + tips on how to change the game language too english.
