SINOPSIS: Man has split the atom and ushered in a new era. But could he know he would also create Them!?

Them! (1954) is a landmark movie about giant radiation-mutated ants that gets better with age and boasts remarkable, academi award - nominated special 
effects. Starring James Whitmore, James Arness and Edmun Gwenn, Them!begin in New Mexico with a child wandering in shock, a ransacked general store - and a 
battered corpse full of enough formic acid to kill 20 men. It ends with an epic struggle in the 700 miles of storm drains under Los Angeles, where the insect
 ordes are beaten. But they're not conquered, because they spawned a generation of films about radioactives creatures. Some approximate the terror but few 
have equalled the artistry of Them!
