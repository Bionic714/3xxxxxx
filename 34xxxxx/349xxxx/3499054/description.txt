This version includes the English .exe, so English JA2 users need only this torrent (and a copy of JA2) to play 1.13, no further downloads are required (The previous torrent required you to get a 1MB file from the mod site, depending on the language of your installation of JA2).

JA2 v1.13 is a mod for the Jagged Alliance 2 game.


We started with the C++ CVS code that DeFrog so wisely ported over to C++.NET. We've located and fixed some bugs in the original and CVS code (as well as our own), and added a host of new features and improvements, as well as externalizing key bits of data to xml.

1.13 is really more of an upgrade to the base game engine than a total conversion. So while we've added new resolutions, improved AI, weather effects and new items, we have left the original maps and quests intact. 1.13 has been structured in such a way that it can be used as a baseline for creating new mods.


IMPORTANT: Make sure you read the entire readme before installing 1.13, as it makes significant changes to the game!
