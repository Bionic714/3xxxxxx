,MonsterfUnC,2006-09-29T18:37Z,"You know, if you can't decide what you think of Hovind and his background, just go read the Wikipedia article. That'd probably be the best source for getting rid of credibility-questions."
,RokemSokemRobot,2006-11-06T04:02Z,"Thanks, bucky katt for the DL. You're too cool. I have the complete file, and I'll seed this video, forever if I can.

If you can run .avi files(7), then DL this. It's  HQ and the screen is 480 X 352, so if you wanted to, you can upload portions of these videos to MySpace,YouTube, or any other such sites, cuz of its screen size.

If you want a higher screen size (632 X 352) version of this exact video, DL the file called ""Kent Hovind Creation Science DVD Series"" The size of the file is 6.15 GB, and it's also .avi format.

Both videos has its reasons for DLing, even though they're the same seminar.

I really, like the smaller screen version, cuz it'll be easier for uploading to MySpace, and other sites so other ppl can watch them. It'll have to be chopped up, so you can get under the file size limit to unload onto such sites, unfortunately. QuickTime, cuts, paste, deletes and copies nicely. Just don't ever work on the original.

I'm seeding all the Hovind videos, for as long as I can, cuz they are worth watching!

P.S.- I'm not associated with Kent Hovind's ministry at. I just know the difference between a truth, and a lie.

,RokemSokemRobot,2007-01-20T09:44Z,"Wikipedia is hardly reliable truth, and not a creationist's favorite site for honest info. The site is not up to date, it doesn't tell the whole truth about both sides of the story, and every bias person in the world can contribute to Wikipedia.
I used to contribute, but I got undermined at every turn by atheists and evolutionists.
It's better to pretend that sites like Wikipedia and TalkOrigins.org don't exist.
There is a site, that has a lot of creation site links you can check out at:
http://www.rae.org/revevlnk.html
Also, check out this list of 600+ qualified scientists, that don't believe in Darwinism:
http://www.discovery.org/scripts/viewDB/filesDB-download.php?command=download&id=660
So, next time an evolutionist tells you that every biologist, palaeontologist, archaeologist, chemist, astronomer, and geologist believes in evolution, just point this link out, and watch them get agitated."
,RokemSokemRobot,2007-01-20T09:56Z,"As someone already has mentioned here, and that is, that Charles Darwin wasn't a scientist, and that is, he had absolutely no PhD in any kind of science, including biology.
Evolutionists can insult the average creationist debater on their qualifications, but yet evolutionists can be such hypocrites by ignoring Charles Darwin's lack of qualifying credentials.
He was as much of an amateur, as anyone could be. Also, there aren't too many ppl that would waste over 30 yrs. of their life by studying the earthworm, or whatever he did with them."

That is an interesting viewpoint, however I haven't read in the Bible where it says the world is flat...

I believe that science and creationism can feed off of one another, and I don't thyink that science has disproved creationism one bit. Micro evolution does indeed happen, but proving macro evolution is a little different. I understand the theory quite well (I have had a LOT of schooling), but there are a lot of gaps in theory that are filled in with assumptions. Why do you suppose that every month or two scientists miraculously discover something that ""could be a missing link"" in human origins?

The wikipedia article about Dr. Hovind presents him in a very negative light, but pretend for a second that you interpreted the Bible literally word for word. It is easy to see how he made mistakes from a societal perspective that would make him look bad when he truly thought he was doing the right thing (I don't come at things from the perspective that he did, so I'm not sticking up for him in that way. I'm just saying he is not a bad guy).

I feel that his theories are a breath of fresh air. Some of them are stretching (a lot), but some of them are interesting and hold weight scientifically.

The entire point of science is to discover truth. This requires an open mind, and preferebly a lack of pessemism (which almost always seems to creap in somehow)."

That was about the dumbest statement you could have made. First of all, Wikipedia is not a credible site at all. It can be edited by ordinary people just like you and me. Second of all, many of the people that wrote about him on there obviously don't like him so in that case they make the negative facts (and sometimes fiction things) stick out more than anything else. Nowhere in that article did I read anything positive about him. Its because its just average people that wont have an open mind for him.

Science is pure stupidity anyway. Its so crazy that they teach this in school because school is so non-religion oriented. The basic definition of religion is belief therefore whatever you can make a belief can become a relgion and Science IS a religion to many people. So why do they teach it in school?
And don't argue with me that science isnt a religion because you will be lying to me, yourself and everyone else.

,beechnut82,2008-04-21T02:02Z,kent hovind is the smartest most truth telling person i've ever heard. i might go down to his museum and hope to see him. i watch him in my church. i want him to e-mail me some time on myspace i'm gonna e-mail him and ask him to get myspace.
,idmountaingirl,2008-09-19T21:22Z,IN answer to OU812.  were you aware that the Bible states the earth is round and that many Bible believers were harrassed because the world of science knew that the earth had to be flat because water cant hold onto a sphere?  I agree that some churches accpeted the flat earth science but the Bible never did.  Are you also aware that the majority of sciences were started by Christians to better understand the creation God had made?  Are you also aware that even the rights of women in the US were started by Christians?  The suffrage movement started by Christians got the right for women to vote and hold jobs.  Feminism takes credit for it though.  Kind of like evolutionists like Steven Jay Gould who still state that the theory for evolution should be accepted even though there is no science to prove any 1 part of it.  Just a thought.  All of the lies in the textbook that Hovind talks about are known to be falacies within the science community.  They even talk about how someday they will find evidence to back up their claims even though none exists now.  What Hovind states is that he is trying to get the lies and proven hoaxes removed not the evolution teachings removed.  He only points out that without declaring them as fact people wont believe them so they must refer to them as fact instead of theory.
,demuffinman,2008-10-13T05:06Z,"FELLOW CHRISTIANS: Carefully examine what you teach for proof of creation and WHO you lift up.

First, Kent Hovind continuously uses known fallacious and shaky arguments.

Second, his personal, unrepentant conduct has only hurt the main focus, that is evangelizing.

His videos have increased my confidence in the Bible. They clearly show how creation scores above evolution.

,NDog,2008-12-06T18:04Z,"1) It is unfortunate that Kent Hovind is in jail at the moment for his beliefs about not paying taxes to the american system which was not in the constitution and was made up by the Reserve Bank which hijacked the monetary system in USA. So I can let him off for that.
2) Yes wikipedia is bias and it is up to whoever to edit according to what their belief is really, so thats why creation is hit very hard on wikipedia, and it is not being objective, but being bias to evolution.
3) Evolution is a religion! You have to believe in it, even though no-one was there to record it at the time (rock-slime-fish-monkey-man?) LOL Creation, however is science as there were people to record it, funny that! Fundamentally our views on evolution are assumptions, not fact, and noone has ever been able to recreate life from nothing, so it is not observable science, it is simply assumption and belief (religion)
4) Be honest! Is it easier to believe that a) God created everything b) over billions of years rocks+rain turned into slime, the slime turned into a tadpole which mutated into a fish which mutated into a monkey which mutated into a man? That is communism and brainwashing! If you believe that then you are definitely religious! (ie believing some crazy stuff!)"
,musterknappe,2008-12-09T20:12Z,"I just don't get it. Fundamentalists destroy the World-Trade Towers, we know what happened in the dark ages, we can compare Western civilization as it is with fundamentalist states like Iran.

,Jonny645,2009-08-31T04:44Z,"""Usually, even a non-Christian knows something about the earth, the heavens, and the other elements of this world, about the motion and orbit of the stars and even their size and relative positions, about the predictable eclipses of the sun and moon, the cycles of the years and the seasons, about the kinds of animals, shrubs, stones, and so forth, and this knowledge he holds to as being certain from reason and experience. Now, it is a disgraceful and dangerous thing for an infidel to hear a Christian, presumably giving the meaning of Holy Scripture, talking  nonsense on these topics; and we should take all means to prevent such an embarrassing situation, in which people show up vast ignorance in a Christian and laugh it to scorn.  The shame is not so much that an ignorant individual is derided, but that people outside the household of faith think our sacred writers held such opinions, and, to the great loss of those for whose salvation we toil, the writers of our Scripture are criticized and rejected as unlearned men.  If they find a Christian mistaken in a field which they themselves know well and hear him maintaining his foolish opinions about our books, how are they going to believe those books in matters concerning the resurrection of the dead, the hope of eternal life, and the kingdom of heaven, when they think their pages are full of falsehoods on facts which they themselves have learned from experience and the light of reason?

Reckless and incompetent expounders of Holy Scripture bring untold trouble and sorrow on their wiser brethren when they are caught in one of their mischievous false opinions and are taken to task by those who are not bound by the authority of our sacred books.  For then, to defend their utterly foolish and obviously untrue statements, they will try to call upon Holy Scripture for proof and even recite from memory many passages which they think support their position, although ?they understand neither what they say nor the things about which they make assertions?.[1 Timothy 1.7]""
