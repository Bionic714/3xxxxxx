This torrent will die very soon,there's not enough
seeders.Lazy bunch of pricks.
I'm gone too."
,Tourniquest,2006-06-17T12:00Z,"Look, rudolfo2, we all appreciate your upload, but since it took several days for you to finish it, it means that many of the people completing it had also shared it 100% at that time. I know I had. There *really* is no reason to be rude."
,rudolfo2,2006-06-17T23:32Z,"No,No;with I'm gone too I've just ment that I'm going to prepare new torrent and I wan't be responsible for no seeders.Next torrent will be so long at 99 % that will give at least 80 % of seeders when finished and I guess I'll be hated for this too."
,Tourniquest,2006-06-18T09:55Z,"No, no, not hated. Very much appreciated."
,EUIX,2006-06-26T20:38Z,  Can we get a Seed going? There is some of us that are close to finishing and theres no seed.
,geceka,2007-11-13T00:02Z,"if somebody still has this, plz seed..."
,LTD602,2007-11-28T15:06Z,"Would someone PLEASE seed? 

I have been searching for this gem for quite some time now, and I'm grateful that it's uploaded, but we all seem to be stuck at around halfway through.

Many thanks! "
,Syntheslizer,2008-01-21T22:57Z,Can we get a re-seed going here?
,jcfperes,2008-02-14T01:37Z,"THANKS FROM BRAZIL, MAN!"

PLEASE!"
,anarchasis,2009-03-22T10:47Z,"Any one could reseed this?
Alguien puede volver a subirlo?
Thanks

Gracias"
,LTD602,2009-04-18T02:32Z,"Would appreciate some more seeders.

This movie is RARE - it's a gem, very hard to find. It's worth keeping it alive around here. And by the looks of it it's a very decent rip."
,Hiwyrobr,2011-09-15T10:11Z,I was stuck at 98% for a week before giving up. WTF? I upload as much as I download.
