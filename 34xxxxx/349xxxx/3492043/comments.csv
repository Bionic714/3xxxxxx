,katamail,2006-07-07T11:30Z,"I say deport all muslim's as we are at war with terrorism and 99.9% of the terrorist's are muslims, in the Second world war the U.S either deported or imprisoned all Japanese living in the country and they were'nt going around bombing skyscrapers or train stations."
,asdfx,2006-08-15T22:54Z,"And you think that somehow justifies a deportation of ALL muslims in the US? Please, most muslims have permission to be there... Are they supposed to deport ALL of them, despite their having allowed them in there in the first place, and despite the fact that 99% of them would never do anything to hurt the country which might have saved them and/or has been their home for their whole lives?

Anyway, this is not the right forum... But please, just think what you're going to say through before posting it. You're hurting people."
,wickedkid,2007-10-21T09:27Z,"katamail dont know what he is talking about, usa are the only country in the world who has been convict(convict/judged - dont know if i uses the right word) for terrorism in the international court. usa have killed so many civilians in terror attacks it makes the 9/11 attack fade away.
