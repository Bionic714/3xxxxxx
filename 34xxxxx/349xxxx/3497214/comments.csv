,w8_ff,2006-06-23T23:20Z,"To all downloaders, you could have a look if your phone is supported by Route 66 at www.66.com"
,w8_ff,2006-06-23T23:30Z,"Which mobile phones are compatible?

""ROUTE 66 Mobile 7"" requires a mobile phone with an internal memory of at least 6 MB, running the Symbian Operating System version 6.1 or later, with the Series 60 interface version 1.0 and 2.0. These are the Nokia 3230, Nokia 6260, Nokia 6600, Nokia 6630, Nokia 6670, Nokia 6680, Nokia 6681/6682, Nokia 7610, Nokia N70 and Nokia N90.

ROUTE 66 Mobile 7 does not support phones with the Symbian UIQ interface and phones with the Microsoft Windows Mobile Operating System or phones series 80."
,red0liv3,2006-06-27T10:41Z,Does this work on Nokia 3250 as Route 66 site says it is compatible with S60 v3 os9
,red0liv3,2006-06-27T10:43Z,Is the torrent available with just the uk maps to be getting on with?
,energize2006,2006-06-28T01:50Z,Is the very latest version that supports series 3 symbian phones ?

,pboxer6,2006-06-30T02:25Z,"66.com says it should work on S60 3rd generation phones like Nokia N80, but I can't get it work.
I've got indications on other forums that it do not yet work. If someone has got it working, please tell."
,superzee,2006-06-30T16:11Z,You are right it does not yet work. There is a newer version of r66 mobile 7.xxx which does support 3rd gen symbian 60. Couldn't get this one working either

Thnx :)"

,xet_erixon,2006-07-22T17:43Z,"jkd4eve_879: My guess is that it won't work on your Moto. You should probably try the ""Route 66 Sony Ericsson"" version. Don't know if it runs on UIQ 2.0, but it works on my A1000 with UIQ 2.1.
Do a search here at TPB for ""route 66 uiq"" and you should be able to find it. 
BTW, it seems that the maps in this package are incompatible with the ""UIQ"" Route 66 software, so save your bandwidth by not downloading this..."
