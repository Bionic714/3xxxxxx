,lotta,2006-06-03T18:01Z,sorry canÂ´t download this
,snikpeis,2006-06-03T22:53Z,no use to put up this torrent if you don't upload.....? 60 peers and 0% health...
,speakeasy,2006-06-03T23:48Z,"Works fine for me.
Thanks a lot sakitodete"
,jappe666,2006-06-04T06:51Z,Inge vidare fart
,sakitodete,2006-06-05T00:51Z,"I am seending all day, are you blind?"
,uraphake,2006-06-05T09:11Z,"Well, you *are* seeding, but by superseeding this thing it's going to take much longer than necessary.

Superseeding only makes sense on a site which implements a ratio on its users. TPB is not one of them. Or, it makes sense if you have control issues. I'll come back for this when you're no longer in charge -- thank you."
,sakitodete,2006-06-05T17:08Z,"then makes sense, because this is a multitracker torrent, iÂ´m sorry."
,uraphake,2006-06-06T14:09Z,"I meant it when I said ""thank you.""
It's your torrent -- upload it in whatever way you wish. I still feel that 10-12 percent per day is too slow."
,uraphake,2006-06-06T14:13Z,"Precisely 12 hours ago previous to this post, everyone was just approaching 38 percent. As of this writing (12 hours later!) the highest percentage is 44.4 percent. How long will you make everyone hang at 99.9 percent?"
,sakitodete,2006-06-06T17:39Z,"I`m sorry my line is very bad, same my english
uraphake say:How long will you make everyone hang at 99.9 percent? 7 days frequently, i`m sorry"
,uraphake,2006-06-09T00:23Z,"Anyone who is just signing on to this torrent will likely find that it doesn't work. You will get the same results on IsoHunt as well. If you really want to get this torrent you will have to open an account at Demonoid (free) and download the torrent from there. To find it there you will have to filter ""16 Blocks"" with ""unseeded"" included in your search for it there. That's because Sakitodete is using ""superseeding"" which will not display as being seeded. Hopefully, TPB will eventually get all of its current bugs worked out and its tracker will actually work. Right now, it's not working properly on all torrents."
,daqck,2006-06-10T19:43Z,"i have finaly got 99.9% wonder how long it will take to get 100%

mind its not the slowest i getting, and a lot to do with with it it is i can't get connectable"
,andyfox01,2006-06-20T11:55Z,"Thanks
