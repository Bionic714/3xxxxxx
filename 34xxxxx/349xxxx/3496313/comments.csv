,Lima,2006-11-15T21:29Z,"I seem to be the only seeder left-I can superseed someone else to take over but for some reason it's not working out that way. A Leecher with %77 appears occasionally and seldom seems to share with the swarm behind. If Mr(s) %77 is listening get on to it or I'll have no choice but to leave all of you high & dry ;|
unfortunately for the rest. 
I have limited upload capacity so let's use it wisely. Cheers all"
