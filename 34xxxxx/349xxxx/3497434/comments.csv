,licker2,2006-07-29T19:19Z,"This is the second making of ""The Last Man On Earth"" (Vincent Price) based on the book by Richard Matheson titled ""I Am A Legend"". Rumor has it that there is a third making of this film starring Will Smith in the works scheduled for a 2007/2008 release based on the title of the original book. This is a ""must see"" movie. It is superbly directed, and is an eye-opener even by todays standards. Highly recomended. If you can find ""Soylent Green"", another Charlton Heston movie, it is almost as equally as good.

,Ran4,2007-04-11T01:22Z,"nameIess - wtf idiot, don't let a stupid remake destroy it!

Watch this, then never look back at the idiot remake."
,creatureoftheid,2007-05-29T16:32Z,"Will Smith and Heston can both get stuffed. This movie is crap. I AM LEGEND is an incredible book. Read the damn book. It's great. The book would be so great as a movie... and cheap. I don't understand why it costs millions of dollars for hollywood to ruin a story. They could give me five bucks and I'll piss in their ear... Oh, and expect I AM LEGEND (Big Willy Style) in theatres in time to ruin your summer."
