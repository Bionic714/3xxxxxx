Donald Rumsfeld is grilled by an audience member at an appearance. The audience member, Mr. Ray McGovern, a 27 year veteran of the CIA proceeds to perform a vivisection on Rumsfeld, using only his OWN words.


MSNBC:

"Our fifth story on the COUNTDOWN, that latter component, the governmental equivalent of the Cone of Silence from the old TV series ?Get Smart,? this afternoon broke down again, for the second time in six days.
First, the president?s lambasting by Stephen Colbert at the White House Correspondents Dinner, and now, today?s vivisection of Defense Secretary Rumsfeld, with only Rumsfeld?s own words as weapons, at a speech in Atlanta, one of several interchanges with critics, in this case a former CIA analyst, lasting four minutes.
Here it is in its entirety, with fact-checks."


LIAR LIAR PANTS ON FIRE.

Do you want to leave a fascist world of liars for your children and grandchildren?

THE GOVERNMENT WORKS FOR US. It should not be an oppressive monkey beating us down. TIME FOR REVOLUTION.
