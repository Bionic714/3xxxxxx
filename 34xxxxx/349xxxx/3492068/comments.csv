,legalegel,2006-07-09T21:33Z,"i thought tpb would go down like suprNova 

THank god it didnt this is the best site For torrents i ever seen.. 

It makes you part of the Pirate Crew to be a part of this site and Helping it survive threw donations thank you MPAA for making the crew bigger and showing people who wanted to get into the pirate crew but thought it to be unsafe thanx MPAA 
For Helping TpB Get even bigger while your real mission was to shut it down you only made TpB

Stronger... Long Live TpB


Nice Upload  "
