,Niosis,2008-02-09T21:05Z,"Just posting to say that this does not work on Leopard.

I'm not blaming the uploader; it's actually recycle as a whole from what I'm reading on other forums."
,Niosis,2008-02-09T21:06Z,"http://www.bigbluelounge.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=41576

That's the post I read regarding it not working on Leopard. 

It'll install, but says something about the permissions not being right etc etc. None of the readme's helped, neither did google."
,dingoat,2008-02-18T11:45Z,"""ReCycle 2.1 has limited compatibility with Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard. It will not run on computers with more than one processor, regardless of whether it is a PowerPC or Intel Mac. We are currently beta testing an update that will address this issue."" from the Propellerhead website."
,dingoat,2008-02-18T11:45Z,"Oh yeah, and thanks for the upload!"
,kristoffer1989,2008-02-27T18:17Z,"You can download version 2.2 update at the propellerheads.se site, but only if you have registred that you own recycle 2.1...

can someone PLEASE do that!

I need to run it on my macbook with leopard!"
,Flextraviganza,2008-03-03T13:51Z,ok so you can login to the propellerhead site thru a proxy server - log name- Robocop2000 password- 11223344 - you have to register the recycle 2.1 version before you can get the update - but someone can do this?? 
,alternativewavers,2008-03-04T00:07Z,"Huh, so I got this working on Leopard with an intel core duo: opens wav files and everything. only problem is it won't export files to Dr. Rex format.... isn't this version supposed to?"
,thedudeabides,2008-03-08T21:14Z,"Bump for anyone who has 2.1.2

,sunj0e,2009-02-05T18:07Z,"Works great.
I used toast8 and under utilities ""mount disc image"" and mounted the dmg.
Opened the file and everything was good to go
Thanks!"
,ajslippery,2011-03-11T19:37Z,"i realize that 99% of people claiming viruses are noobs and are wrong , but this file has a virus in the recycle .exe itself .. it is a zlob trojan and it fkd my computer up bigtime, could not even get it to POST or boot at all. every recycle torrent ive dl'ed is the same way , just rebranded keygens but all have the same zlob trojan in it . Norton as well as windows malicious software remover both hit on it , even after i ignored the warnings and installed it anyways , it was clearly an active virus , spreading and duplicating , and doing all kinds of bad stuff "
