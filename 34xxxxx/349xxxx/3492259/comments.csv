,duckwrangler,2006-06-04T09:53Z,Can someone tell me what areas this map covers please?
,TantA,2006-06-04T10:28Z,Foldername is MGUSA 4.0
,cmdrtorrez,2006-07-05T06:59Z,"I installed this and it's Garmin Metroguide USA v3.0, *not* v4.0. v3.0 does not have autoroute information for the handheld units. Can anyone post v4.0? TIA"
,dieselhorst509,2006-07-06T19:30Z,"This is Metroguide 4 (4.02). That is what the original disks were labelled. It will autoroute on both of my GPS units. The map source is 3.0, which is the older, non-Navtech data. It may be a bit dated (2001), but shows much more detail in rural areas than the newer Navtech map source. The newer Navtech-based Metroguide products will not autoroute."
,cmdrtorrez,2006-07-08T23:56Z,"Yes, you are correct and I was mistaken. After installing the maps, I went into MapSource, Help-->About MapSource...-->Product Info... and it said ""MetroGuide USA"" Data Version 3.00, cr 2001 Tele Atlas North America. It turns out that MetroGuide USA *v4* has that confusing version info in MapSource.

I am able to autoroute on my Garmin GPSMAP 60C now as well. When I tried it before, I had it loaded with other maps and when it asked for ""Region"" when doing a ""Find"", the MG4's info wasn't showing up (so I erroneously concluded that it couln't autoroute). Turns out that I had to press ""Menu"" and select the MG4 map and then leave ""Region"" blank, and then choose the city. Works like a charm now. Thanks a million for this torrent, I've been looking for it for quite a while. :)"
