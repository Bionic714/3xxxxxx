,leannenude,2008-04-07T05:50Z,"This file works fine and sounds excellent!  Not for the amateurs and static junkies, but if you REALLY know what a DTS CD is, don't miss this!"
,Granchy,2008-04-14T23:25Z,Thank you so much!  I can't get enough of DTS CDs!
,marero_1,2008-11-22T09:20Z,"For those of you who don´t know what a DTS signal means It´s exactly a raw digital signal without analog conversion. To be able to hear music from this signal you have to play the burned cd/dvd on a HOME DVD or HOME THEATRE that bears the logo ""DTS"" on it. If you only see the Dolby Surround logo you probably won´t be able to hear the encoded music but pure and plain static. This DVD MUST be set to bitstream or DTS OUTPUT and conected via coaxial or optical cable to a 5/6/7.1 receiver or home theatre with as many speakers as possible, perfectly balanced and with your receiver set to ""DTS"" too.  This kind of sound is the best yet invented by mankind.  Be careful with your speakers, you can actually blow them out!!! Beware of ""upconverted"" ""unofficial"" releases, they are probbably stereo ""homemade"" DTS audio CD´s...!!!"
