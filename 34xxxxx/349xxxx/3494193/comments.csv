[V],Kifen,2006-06-10T11:33Z,the theory of intelligent design = the buzzword for the right-christian-movement i USA. Beware. Beware. Next time they strike is to tell us: Earth is flat
,bucky katt,2006-06-10T12:19Z,Christians are hunted by lawyers in the USA so the only way we can teach our children the beliefs that founded our country seems to be with words like intelligent design. Just like most of us have to battle the MPAA for movies and software here in the USA we also have to battle the ACLU whom is banning books and teachings just like Hitler did.
[V],Kifen,2006-06-10T13:12Z,"So Christians i USA donÂ´t burn & ban books and movies, you kidding me now. ROFl"
,bucky katt,2006-06-10T17:47Z,And I suppose you would like to burn and ban this torrent? I am a Christian and I promote what I believe in just like everyone else here rather than trying to force others to give up what they believe in promoting. I am not bashing any of the torrents here that I do not like.
[V],Kifen,2006-06-10T21:21Z,"Oh, no I dont want to ban this torrent, Im just warning other people to download this piece of crap rightwing-christian bullshit. And by the way, Im a beliver,but not christian.."

,eccles,2006-06-11T13:44Z,"@bucky katt, Christians are not hunted by lawyers in the USA. They are merely prevented from bombarding schoolchildren with indoctrination that is little short of low level brainwashing. Your constitution prevents it and lawyers are acting on that.
As for intelligent design as a concept, this is a faith issue, not science. Science hasn't worked everything out yet but that doesn't mean that the bits we haven't worked out are due to intelligent design. I don't deny you your faith but trying to dress it up in pseudo-scientific gobbledegook is as sad as it is insidious."
,bucky katt,2006-06-12T01:41Z,Not providing opposing points of view and letting people draw their own conclusions is not science it is brainwashing. Evolution has become a religion defended and preached by lawyers not scientists. Do we really want lawyers educating our children on our origins when it goes against our own national and personal beliefs? Evolution can only stand by blocking all challenges to it because they know it fails when opposed with true science.
[V],Kifen,2006-06-13T07:31Z,"""true science"" ??????????????????????????"
,Wasa1000,2006-06-14T22:00Z,true science... good one :-D
[V],Kifen,2006-06-15T08:39Z,In the dark ages they (the christians) banned people who said that the earth was not the center of the universe. Today they are eager to ban people who believes in Darwin theorys of evolution. Nothing have changed in 2000 years....
,janboterham,2006-07-03T17:50Z,"Intelligent design was an interesting theory however it has allready been disproven. It was however an electrifying idea even to me, a hardcore none believer. After evrything is said and done, one problem remains, why waste our time trying to prove or disprove any religion if that very same religion is responsible for countless million deaths throughout the centuries. Intollarance and bigatry seems to be religions greatest accomplisments. People are never killed in the name of science... You choose, I allready have."
,wilhelmwagner1,2006-11-03T22:25Z,"I don't think you should attack bucky for listing this torrent. But you are wrong about one thing, there have been many killed in the name of science. Charles Darwin's half-cousin Sir Francis Galton read The Origin of Species and was captivated by the idea of ""Variation under Domestication"". He studied ways in which the breeding of people could improve the human population. He wrote a book called ""Hereditary Genius"" which demonstrated his ""Inheritance of intelligence"". It was his belief that not only intellectual traits were inherited but moral, and personality traits were also passed on from one generation to the next. Galton invented the term ""eugenics"", which led to the idea that breeding should be controlled by government. 

A man by the name of Madison Grant read Galton's work and amongst other ideas implemented the term ""Aryan"" into a work of his own, ""The Passing of the Great Race"" which Adolf Hitler referred to as his ""Bible"". Euthanasia was just one of the tools of the third reich to clease the world of undesirable people. 

Just so you know, Grant was a co-founder of the American Eugenics Society and a colleague of Lothrop Stoddard. Stoddard wrote ""The Rising Tide of Color Against White World-Supremacy"" and was appointed by Margaret Sanger to the board of directors of the ""American Birth Control League"", which was the previous name of what is known today as ""Planned Parenthood"".

I did this research on my own and did not take this from one source. If you do this research yourself you will find that these statements are correct. I would appreciate it if you would not lump me in any particular category as you would find if you knew me that I do not fit into any. But I would like to state that many millions of people have died in the name of science! 

I realize that there were corruptions and bigotry involved in these ""sciences"", but you will find that these still exist in the world today. There are fears of history repeating itself; from those that fear religious fanatics taking over the world, to those that fear that moral values will be eroded by those who do not believe in one. I think it is good to look at these other points of view objectively and accept or reject them on their own merit.

,skwiley,2008-07-09T01:59Z,"Thanks bucky katt.  I've been wanting to see this.  Just sorry, and ashamed of, my fellow Pirate Bay users, that I had to troll through all the attacks looking for a quality rating.  If you don't like the torrent, simply do not download it.  But raking the ULer over the coals is just plain stupid.  An effort to share something was made, take it or leave it.
Wondering if these fools call folks from the FREE section of Craigs List to complain that they don't like what's being given away..."
,lillyho,2008-07-21T23:52Z,"Hahaha, poor stupid people. This is just bullshit..."
,pkunzip_me,2008-11-12T14:06Z,"I'm not a christian, I find this film interesting and stimulating and sense no ideology being pushed on me.  To claim that Darwin(a man before Einstien's time) understood completely how life works or came to be is totally absurd and takes a great leap of faith. "
