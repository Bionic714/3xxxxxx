,AmsterGay,2006-07-23T12:12Z,fantastic ....... do you know if there is a map for Madeira?  Going there in September and it's not included in my Maps of Europe ( TomTomGO)
,junger1,2006-10-26T01:30Z,how do you activate this map? any ideas
[V],felch,2006-11-28T20:25Z,"Using TomTom Navigator 6 (on a Windows PDA) this map doesn't seem to show up in the map list.  It seems to be missing a Canary-Islands-Map.cfg file which is normally with the other maps.

If you have any ideas please comment and PM me - thanks :)"
