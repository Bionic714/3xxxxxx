,aegense,2006-10-27T10:52Z,"The quality is very bad on my computer. I wonder if I need a special codec. I have installed the latest version of K-Lite codec pack, so everything should be fine. But the colors are strange. Black and white with a redish furnish and a green line in top of the picture. I have had similar problems with other moovies."

Any subtitle will work with the movie which is subbed, as long as the subtitle file has the exact same name as the movie file"
,beaudyk,2008-01-11T02:08Z,This is a really great movie especially Bcuz it is based on a true story.  I hope someone will keep it seeded so latecomers like me will have a chance to get it.  Thanks BTW for all the help you guys give!
