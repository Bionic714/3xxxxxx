These are not compressed winrar files but CloneDVD images.
In Nero you can skip the burning wizard. Instead
1. Go directly to File > Open... in Nero. 
2. Select the DVD image. 
3. You will get a Burn DVD dialogue. This will allow you to burn the CloneDVD images. Burn!
4. Please post progress."
