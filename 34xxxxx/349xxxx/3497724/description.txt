"To you, the reader of this book, I want to say, this book is not written merely as a history of my travels in Tibet, neither is it meant to be a display of words to reveal the Truth, for the Truth cannot be revealed in words. Neither should it be read from an intellectual point of view so as to give pleasure to the mind; nor is it meant to give you a new religion or a new authority or belief.."
