,SpectreMD6,2010-04-30T17:26Z,"exactly how many people have this os? because asking for people to up 10 times is a bit heavy for those with low sending bandwidths.

i will up the usual 2 and hope that others will get the idea, we are meant to b a share community not take the flipping piss out of others community.

anyway, i need a full breakdown, ie, licence key, exact build number, any changes, so on and so forth.
i bet this is the beta from the site and not really much done, point of advice take a gander at reactos source and check against this one - this is a cloned version made directly out of reactos, i know beacuse i have compared then, line for line, artworks and names are not matched in every case but the inportant parts are.
so if you know what to do, use reactos parts for licnse key and other failures, also use free-dll sites to get keyboard.dll, hid.dll, and mouse.dll, they are old in these!!!"
,SpectreMD6,2010-04-30T17:27Z,"btw, a nice picture and better nfo might be good, if you wish i could work on one, and up as a request only. see ya on the other side :):):)"
,sk8puss,2012-04-12T07:23Z,"OMG, u n00bs! Figure it out, like systmltdn told u. Ever heard of Google? How did u find this download in the first place?

I grabbed this torrent yesterday, and am running it today.

The serial begins with a ""0"" and ends with a ""7"".

n00bs..."
