,Jaw_knee,2008-07-28T23:26Z,"I recently bought DS2 from a bargain bin; I originally got DS1 years ago after playing the demo off've a CGW demo disk and loved the hell out of it; I'm thinking about reinstalling my copy, but I'd like to grab a copy for a friend of mine. They're impossible to find in stores, so could anyone tell me whether the online play works with the ripped version? (Or whether the online play is even still there? I don't think it used gamespy like DS2 does)"
,Niallite,2008-07-31T06:07Z,"@Jaw_knee: I found the game a couple of years ago(way before DS2), originally got it from a friend, and by years ago I mean 4+ years.

I reinstalled it to the end of last year, but I had to torrent a copy because I lost disc one, from what I remember, you need a legit serial(find one on serials.ws - beware of porn ads) then you can register an account. From what I remember, only Germans were playing."
,Niallite,2008-08-03T11:41Z,"Common guys, I'm stuck at 90.4%, if you can't seed, please just seed it for a few more hours, I can seed it every other GMT night(midnight-10am) and my ratio is already 1.18 just downloading what I have now."
,Wormicle,2008-08-28T08:50Z,"As soon as people started saying ""It dun work on vista!!!11!!1"", or to that effect, I had to find out for myself.
Works fine on MY Vista machine."
,radek1990,2008-12-10T16:59Z,unpack both cd and copy them in 1 map than try install i had the same prob
,squidzor,2008-12-29T12:35Z,"this realy works!!!!!  i swear! i play it now man i have been seearching for this game 5000 hours xD

On vista you just have to do compaliteiten and then xp and run it as administrator"
,munahiki1,2009-01-27T16:41Z,Seed.. can you leave to seed for 24hours after this ? (night would be good)...
,Hannu_87,2009-04-13T21:41Z,"Long time i played this game...need to give it a try, can't play any conan atm, my gfx crashed :/ so i'm stuck on a crappy laptop "
,isisx3,2009-06-10T14:37Z,"It should work on vista, my ex had installed this game on my computer and it worked fine, but at a lame attempt to piss me off during a break up he uninstalled it now forcing me to have to download at 1kbs. since the fact is that i'm in italy for the month and using a wireless key adapter and can only use the internet 5 hrs a day I should be done with this download within the next year..

SEED PLEASE?

Oh, and if you do have problems running this game on vista cope and paste the application to your desktop and right click it and click on run as administrator. Then it should work."
,Blk-,2009-11-19T13:42Z,"Please seed, 0 kb/s atm.. There were 5 seeders earlier today but 0 now."

,Dr.drgn,2011-02-14T02:17Z,upload speed is realy slow im new to the torrent world but i need my peers plz help 
,oplahfling,2011-07-02T11:10Z,"This game works fine on vista. At first I had a glitch when I started the game up. The Title menu was all black. All I had to do was go to the folder its installed in and open the DSVideoConfig app, and change the screen size. if the problem your having is while playing, go here and get the official patch: 

http://www.fileplanet.com/111247/download/Dungeon-Siege-v1.0---v1.11.1462-Patch

The first disk is small enough to keep on your hard drive and mount to d-tools (or whatever software you used to mount and install) to play the game without a crack.

If its still not working, chances are your computer is shit and you need to get it cleaned up and fixed, or you need a new one. It's not vista, I've had games back from '93 work on it, and only one that didn't. Of course Operation: Outbreak was shit anyway, it fucking didn't even work on the windows 98 computers it was made for."
