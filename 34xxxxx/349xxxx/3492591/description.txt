30/03/2006 : First of all, thank you ! Thank you very much for all people who support my works since the beginning and give me constructive critics about my simfiles !
After the success of DANCING WIPEOUT, I'm happy to show you the 2nd mix, better and better than the first ;)
96 DWI only for your pleasure, and some nonstops/oni for advanced players ;)

You need Bittorent (or other program who support .torrent) to download the pack (320 MO).
When download is complete, just launch the .smzip, and play !
I hope you will like this mix !
