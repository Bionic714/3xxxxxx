Keep your virus app running as always, I won't reseed this pack atm.

Great sound support! Like in DOS games how souns never works with any card made past 95, well this works with my Laptops RealTek, and probably any card since the it emulates and old card and send the sound to Windows like any other!

The download is stopped. Please let us help people.
Let's do ""The Pirate Bay"" but grow ever, and be the best of all. For that to happen, we must have good torrents to download and have good rates of Seeders / Leechers."
