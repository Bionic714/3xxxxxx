,phantom195,2006-06-20T17:01Z,"XoSkellet, your comment about ""their stupid languages"" is unbelievably stupid and shows how limited a person you are. 
Has it ever occured to you that on our 6-billion-people planet English isnt everyone's mother tongue ? 
This is a Japanese movie with Polish subtitles. The desc is in Polish for Polish people. If you dont understand something you're not the target audience."
,lordpug,2006-06-22T04:19Z,You might also have noticed that this is a swedish site... not an english one.
