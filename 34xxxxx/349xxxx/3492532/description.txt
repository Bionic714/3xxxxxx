       Enjoy and please remember to seed!!

       NOTES:
  
       The video source if from the MAVEN TS XVID ( major thanx to Maven for this quality 
       release). the audio wasn't too god on it though so i have done quite a lot of work on
       this. I have used 4 different sources and by mixing and editing this film now has a
       better stereo audio track. it still isn't perfect but it is better than it was
       originally.

       There were about 3 parts in the movie that had foreign subtitles. these have been
       removed and replaced with english ones. I've modified the opening titles too and now
       the x-men-the last stand title is fully english now too. i've addd a few end credits
       to this jut so i can add a little bit at the end. the extra scene was only captured
       off a camera phone so don't expect quality but at least now anyone that hasn't seen
       this scene can now see it.

       hope you enjoy it.
