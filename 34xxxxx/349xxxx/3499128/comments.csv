,GoodTunes,2010-11-03T14:18Z,"FLAC is MUCH higher quality then MP3. The MP3 codec deletes much of the ""info"" inside of a song in order to compress it. 
Think about it, a ""loss-less"" file in FLAC, etc., can be around 45mb, while the MP3 equivalent is around 3.5mb. What happened to the other 42mb? Gone, hence the poorer quality. 
You're probably used to the quality of MP3, you don't realize what you're missing. Listen to a FLAC and MP3 of the same song, and you'll shit your pants."

,deadone38,2011-03-22T19:10Z,"The files are labeled as  ""fla"", they need to be changed to flac. Also, my version will not decode a file if there are commas and other strange punctuation in the file name, so those also need to be changed"
