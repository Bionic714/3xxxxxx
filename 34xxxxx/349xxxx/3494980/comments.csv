,vascoa,2008-01-20T02:05Z,"Hi ppl.. 

I want to know if the Mad Max I of this torrent is the original version or the US dubbed.. anyone still around to answer that?. 

cheers.. "
,Malkstar,2008-05-08T20:29Z,"Vascoa, it is the original version (Australia and UK release) not the US release- none of the Australian accents have been dubbed over."
,coffeepowers,2008-05-10T18:39Z,how come there's audio but no video when i try to play it?
,kevster1976,2008-06-09T07:39Z,use VLC Media Player
,gutnik,2008-06-12T15:07Z,"For Mad Max 3 here, I get an error from VLC saying that the AVI is broken, and it only plays the first 16 seconds. I would be cautious with this download."
,gutnik,2008-06-12T15:22Z,"sorry ignore last comment, the 3rd file is fine actually."
