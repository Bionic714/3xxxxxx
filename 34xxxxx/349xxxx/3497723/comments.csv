DVDSanta says ""Unable to open the video file....""

Please inform wich codec is needed to deal with this. WMP is up-to-date, and has played many Xvid files"
,stu,2006-07-01T16:19Z,"try vlc player
http://www.videolan.org/vlc/ 
it has everything needed built in.
or if you want to be more complicated; the two audio tracks are matroska encoded. most codec packs include everything needed. or go direct http://packs.matroska.org/latest/Matroska_Pack_Lite.exe"
,Salustius,2006-07-02T09:40Z,Thank you . VLC works. I'll try the Matroska codec with the Conversion utility I use to make DVD.
