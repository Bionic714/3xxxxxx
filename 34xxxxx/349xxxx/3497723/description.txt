about this file:
dual audio, french and english tracks! (timed up and db levels equalised by me)
correct aspect ratio from english DVD (french dvd has a slightly stretched image)
this version also brings together the opening french and english texts; sections of Jean Racine's Bajazet and T.S.Eliot's Ash-Wednesday (their joint insert was created by myself)

about the film:
Sans Soleil is Chris Markers masterpiece. No one edits film like Chris Marker.
In the early 80s capitalism had spread across the globe, political definitions started to weaken, culture started to fade, and the digital age was just being born.
bookended by iceland, chris markers hypnotic poem moves from japan and its tv's to africa and its fishing villages, as the notions of memory/time/history are put into context with the dawn of this new malleable age.

about the documentary:
10 brief minutes. includes an interview with terry gilliem about chirs marker.
from the english dvd.
