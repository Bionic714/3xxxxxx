,pacman_55,2006-07-24T21:23Z,Don't leech this shit. The rar archives are corrupted and will not expand. Don't waste time on this.

Yeah your PS2 needs a new chip for playing burned games. I payed a 100 euro for it. Just search with google for someone who place the chips it could be done from $40 to $200. Its reale worth it."

Don't waste your money on a chip...get swap magic or learn the soft mod trick from afterdawn.com...My system plays all burnt games without a chip or swap magic.

@tilso06

Try Nero 7"
