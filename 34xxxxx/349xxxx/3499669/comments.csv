[T],Ythan,2006-06-30T09:51Z,"I know this is rather large, I will seed long enough that everyone who wants can get it."
,i.am.juicy,2006-06-30T10:33Z,Looks nice. Thanks.
[T],Ythan,2006-07-03T06:53Z,Seeing a lot of people dropping off the swarm once they complete the download... help seeding is appreciated! I only have 768k up.
,futaris,2006-07-12T10:45Z,"Does anyone know what tool they used to check / rename / zip these files?  I have part of the GBA ROMs, but they don't correspond 100%..."
,Maza_87,2006-07-18T21:39Z,"Thanks a lot for this!
The speed seems quite sluggish but I have time to wait ;)"
,luigibros,2006-07-21T03:40Z,if i download this what can i do with it? if it goes on a ROM how am i gonna play it on my SP?
[T],Ythan,2006-07-21T19:14Z,You should read up on ROMs and emulation. In this case it doesn't refer to a CD-ROM but a dump of the game data. You can play ROMs on a Gameboy by transferring them from your computer to a rewritable flash cart. See http://www.gameboy-advance.net/ for more information.
,vivi1969,2006-08-28T12:47Z,how can I download gba roms 0001 - 2437 ???
[T],Ythan,2006-08-30T23:55Z,"I'd love to help but your question doesn't make any sense. Install Azureus or uTorrent, then click the 'DOWNLOAD THIS TORRENT' link above."
,chronjohnson,2006-09-29T03:07Z,"Yo Y, rock my box cover packs for these if you're going to use them on your XBox.  Shits are correct.  http://xbox.nugnugnug.com"
,camilinha,2006-10-10T03:34Z,por favor o que  tenho que fazer  para baixar esse arquivo de 10 gb...

,Cloud_StrifeVII,2007-04-01T02:06Z,no ds-x cant play GBA files
,Rabiah596,2007-06-15T04:46Z,"Im trying to download specific games but whenever i do it causes my program to lag out very badly.. not sure if its because of the large list or not but it gets annoying to look thru the entire list more than once for just 10 games, would be better if the list was shorter, also note there are many duplicates in here."
[T],Ythan,2007-06-19T23:20Z,"Not that you'll switch clients for this one torrent, but for what it's worth the file list updates instantaneously for me in Azureus 2.5.0.4. Also note that the 'duplicates' are all distinct ROMs (either different languages or different versions) and they may be of interest to collectors and non-English speakers."
,jais1993,2007-07-21T17:20Z,"Holy crap, that is ALOT of games!!!"
,ozelotbeaver,2008-03-15T01:17Z,"I've tried to find Wolfenstein 3D in this pack.. but it seems to be missing, so either you're missing som roms or I'm just too tired right now to look through 2437 roms... hmmm"
,ozelotbeaver,2008-03-15T01:25Z,sorry... found it.. nr 0399 thanks for the up!
,Darkjeb,2008-04-22T00:25Z,seed!!!!!!!!!!!!
,sklorpo,2008-05-26T01:55Z,This is a perfect torrent.  Thanks.  I only needed a few rare games that I just couldn't find anywhere but I'll seed those for as long as I can.
,Macoco,2008-06-03T23:31Z,Keep this one gooing good torrent :D
[T],Ythan,2008-06-10T14:38Z,"Hi cd-text, I used the list from http://releases.pocketheaven.com/ to verify these ROMs although you should note a few of the names have had minor changes over the years. The checksums and numbers should all be the same though."
,w0G,2008-06-22T11:37Z,"Thanks, can people keep seeding for life also so new-commers can get them too.

Thanks"
,foppcorN,2008-07-09T17:20Z,"Very nice! Please seed, I'm currently at wimpy 25kb/s."

this will help you!"
,chronjohnson,2008-08-07T08:15Z,People who think you have to look through 2400 files to find a set of characters you're looking for arranged in a certain order must forget they're on a computer.
,mrCallert,2008-08-20T17:30Z,does theese roms work on a mobile gba emulator ( Meboy )
