The unceasing Rain??
The ?sealed city?, abandoned 30 years ago after a biochemical warhead bombardment.
The uninhabited ruins, ruled over now by autonomous combat drones.
And in their midst, a single tall building, rising like a magical tower in the darkness.
The NATIONS shall crumble;
The RAIN shall fall;
And the JUNKERS shall inherit the EARTH."

Will be seeding for a long time."
