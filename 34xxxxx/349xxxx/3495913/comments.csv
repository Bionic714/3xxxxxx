,Mogz,2006-06-18T15:01Z,"like i explained b4 luke alot of us have moved to demoniod for several reasons.

1. No more leechers since the site uses the ratio system.

2. No spammers

3. the site and tracker work great (unlike here)

4. Complaint Dept. where we can report abusive members

5. and they dont have the heat turned up on them by the police like here.

Thats the reason several of us have moved to there."
