,Sargent_D,2006-06-04T14:08Z,"Hi, is this DVD NTSC or PAL?"
,chaos_breed,2006-06-04T14:35Z,Whats the deal with .mdf files?!? Use a format that everyone can read!!
,PRwood,2006-06-04T14:40Z,"It's NTSC, and why would you not be able to read .mdf files. Just mount or burn it's pretty simple."
,PRwood,2006-06-04T14:50Z,"By the way I removed the special features to maintain the highest quality, since i've personally never found a decent version online before. This is a rent and burn straight from the original."
,boSTREAM,2006-06-05T09:10Z,is it 5.1 or 2.0?
,PRwood,2006-06-05T15:32Z,"I beleive it's in stereo, Im unsure if they remastered it in surround. But eaither way it's a classic."
