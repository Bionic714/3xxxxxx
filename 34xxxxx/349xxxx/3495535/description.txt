I'm new to uploading torrents, and am just trying to get the hang of how it works.  If it works at all, this should be eight or nine pretty random songs from Guided By Voices, Decemberists, Trail of Dead, and a couple others.  

There's one song on here ("Hey Goodbye" from Macha) that's particularly excellent and proabably a little hard to find online these days.  

Anyway, if there are any issues, please let me know.
