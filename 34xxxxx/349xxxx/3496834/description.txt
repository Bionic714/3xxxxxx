Stefan Brisland-Ferner of Garmarna and Totte Mattsson of Hedningarna are both masters of the Swedish hurdy gurdy. On Prototyp, they have come together to demonstrate the range and power of this ancient, versatile instrument, which has been dubbed a medieval synthesizer. Exclusively using sounds generated from hurdy gurdys, they play, process, sample, and tweak both traditional and original tunes in innovative and provocative ways.
