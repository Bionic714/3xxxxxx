And wtf is all of your problem guys all of u asks the same fucking thing in every torrent:p As Descore said how fucking hard can it be to ""unrar"" stuff and put it in daemon tools?! i mean gosh! ive know this since i was like 10 years!

1. Unrar
2. Mount in daemon tools (why burn when u can mount?)
3. install the game
4. enjoy this very fucking good game!
5. if it asks for a cd which it's not suppose to crack the game!
6. and u with the white screens buy a new graphic cARd spend at least 230 dollars:p"

1. Download Oblivian
2.Download and install Daemon Tools and WinRAR
3.Double click on rld-ts4
4.Drag out the .iso file to anywhere
5.Make sure the Daemon tools icon is on the bottom right system tray (by the clock) and left click on it(looks like a thunder bolt)
6.Click Device 0
7.A window should pop up, look for the .iso file you unrared and click open on window after selecting it.
8.Install should run by itself. You install an you're done.

,Aphael,2007-02-21T22:52Z,"When the first jawdropping moments pass you're gonna find a world that is about as ""living and breathing"" as a dead fish. It's beautiful - but it sure as hell isn't an RPG. 

If you really want to get the most out of this game then get it for the 360. Slouch down in a comfy chair and play it the lobotomized vegetable way -- with a console. It's actually sort of playable on the 360. You fart around and keel shit and loot shit and just generally goof off. 

On PC however it's a great, big, steaming pile of shit. Forget about an in-depth RPG experience with tons of micro management, interesting character development and hard puzzles. It just isn't there. Heck, I'm surprised the save screen doesn't say ""Don't unplug your PC"" during the save process.

Yeah...I'm that bitter about it. Fuck Bethesda."

,Huggla,2007-05-09T19:26Z,"TO creston91: IF you use Azureus, you just wait for your download to be completed. And then just let it wait in the box below the download box, so everyone else gets the game faster. MORE SEEDERS = FASTER DOWNLOADS :)"
,Huggla,2007-05-09T19:28Z,"I HAVE A SERIUS PROBLEM WITH THE GAME!

IVE COMPLETED THE DOWNLOAD, AND ALWAYS WHEN IM PLAYING THE GAME FOR ABOUT 10 MIN, I'LL JUST HAVE TO FAST-TRAVEL OR WALK OUT A DOOR FOR THE GAME TO LAG OFF.

,Dannback14,2010-05-15T20:18Z,"How to Install The Elder Scrolls: Oblivion

1)Download the torrent
2)Look for the file called rld-tes4
3)Un-rar rld-tes4 (what program you use to 
un-rar does not matter, just make sure you know where you un-rar to)
4)When you have un-rared rld-tes4 another file
named rld-tes4 will appear,this is a ISO-file
5)Mount the ISO-file (rld-tes4) with a ISO program (I use Daemon Tools Lite)
6)Run Setup.exe (installer)
7)Install the game: click Next, I accept the terms of the license agreement, Next, , Next, Install
8)Wait for the game to intall/Enjoy the comercial (Oblivion for mobile phone )
9)Click Finish
10)Play the game 
Hope this guide will help Someone :-)"
