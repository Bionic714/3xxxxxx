,Cineasten,2007-01-22T12:46Z,"If you try really hard you can still find the uncut version (about 15 minutes longer). 

I have the old US-version (cut), the british uncut version, the cut dvd and the uncut dvd.

Unfortunately I cannot rip my dvds or vhs-tapes."
,F4R207,2008-03-20T17:38Z,"Watership Down (Den l책nga f채rden) is one of my alltime favourit cartoons, along with the Secret of NIMH (Nimhs hemlighet). Had no idea about this one untill I googled imdb for a friend (about Watership Down) and checke dout what else the incredible due behind that one had done..

Now I just have to find that uncut version.

They just don't do animated classics like NIMH and Watership Down any more :\"
