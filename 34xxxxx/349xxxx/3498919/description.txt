This is a very rare movie based on the book by Richard Adams.

From IMDb:



An animated adaptation of Richard Adams' novel, about a pair of dogs (Snitter and Rowf) who escape from a research laboratory and try to survive in the wild with the help of a cunning fox (The Tod). The lab director tries to keep the escape quiet, but as an increasing number of sheep are found killed, word leaks out, together with rumours that the dogs might be plague carriers...

Sadly this is the cut version of the film with sever scenes missing. The uncut version is even more rare with only 2 releses, the origanl VHS UK release of the film and a region 4 australian relese.
