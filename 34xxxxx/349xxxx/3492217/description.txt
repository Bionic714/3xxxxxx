Repost of this torrent. Same as before. Swedish non-unselectable subs. VHS-copy from 20-some years ago (I think it was aired in 1985 in Sweden on SVT 2).

Bear with my ADSL speed. I will continue to seed until at least 2 has downloaded completely. Then I will post part 2. OK?

Also after all four discs of this has been posted, I will post All The Rivers Run II (aka The Movie).

My next project is Against the Wind (Jon English) Mot alla vindar, all 13 episodes.
Interesting for you too? Comments welcome.
