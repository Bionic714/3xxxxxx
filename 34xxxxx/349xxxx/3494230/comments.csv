It will be seeded for the foreseeable future (let's say until November 2006, barring seeding computer meltdown), even if it's not on the pirate bay tracker. The trackers this torrent is on seem to be working."

I don't mean to spam anything but can recommend some other good info.
If you like natural cures I could suggest the health radio show by Dr. bill Deagle, especially the ones about the allicin products (allimax, alliultra, etc) or the whole food products or many others. The links at the following webpage are free downloads:

,The Living Homer,2008-01-14T00:49Z,"Here's the thing about Kevin Turdeau. He's an admitted felon. He said that in one of his books. The second link posted talking about the weight loss cure book, doesn't really help anyone. People don't write good reviews.While he might steal some things from other researchers/physicians, he gives credit to some of them. Also the people who criticize the weight loss cures book have not done the actual ""treatment"". I've talked to my dad about it. He has studied health and fitness and all that stuff for over 30 years. He says that it would work but people actually have to follow it. Granted he isn't a physician, but he knows what he's talking about. You do have to change your lifestyle though. You can't continually eat all that garbage that you currently do. His weight loss ""cure"" consists mainly of cleansing out your body and eating healthier after it's cleansed out. This is just my $0.02 on his books (mainly the weight loss one though)."

Apparently not."

,wejones,2008-12-07T15:33Z,"If the recording is anything like the book, don't waste your time.  The book is a rant with no substance and is really just an info-book to sell you Trudeau's services.  They had several of Trudeau's books for $1.00 on clearance at our local half price bookstore.   I grabbed them thinking man what a kill.  Sat down with the free coffee and read all three in less than 40 minutes.  Note 40 minutes, that is how little the substance of the books were.  Pretty much if you want any info you can go to Trudeau's website and sign up for something.  DO NOT Waste your bandwidth."
,Skreshavik,2009-07-22T19:56Z,"Don't listen to these agents who are paid blood money by the Government.
Kevin Trudeau was a convicted felon of credit card fraud (irrelevant in any case on this book), it's also kind of interesting how he's been sued 15+ times by various State Attorney Generals, and all of them has said that there were no wrongdoings found on Kevin's behalf.

Chapt. 6, pages 128-176, Kevin lists several natural cures and preventative measures (36 of them).
Chapt. 12, pages 320-340, Kevin lists quite a few sources, and a good chunk of them have the M.D. title and Ph.D. title(60 different sections, with an average of 4 sources a section)

Really fast DL, quite impressed with 200 kB/s a sec. with the small amount of seeders here. Too bad Microsoft is picky with OGG files."
,JayDomSpacePirate,2010-02-03T13:17Z,"anyone who says DONT D/L DONT waste your bandwith or all that... listen this is free imformation only a fool wont learn something for free. and only one of ""THEM"" dont want you to have this book, wtf it takes 2 minites of actual time spent to d/l theese books. you waste more time masturbating. get the damn book and make up your OWN mind."
