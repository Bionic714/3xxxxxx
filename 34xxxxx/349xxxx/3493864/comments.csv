,warpengi,2006-06-09T21:37Z,I pray what you say is true pelgrim108.  The rest of the world will be able to breath a sigh of relief and feel a little safer should that happen.
,pelgrim108,2006-06-10T01:19Z,"It will be the end of America land of the free and the beginning of the pan-American Union land of the slaves the ruling elite and the corruption.
And another big country will take the lead. Maybe China or Russia or Both.
I see no relief in this. The americans are not bad people. I hope the independent media will grow there, so the people will see the evil deeds they as a nation are comitting and put an end to it."

,sweden_man29,2008-04-06T15:37Z,have that movie gone on disney channel yet
,viedma,2009-03-20T04:29Z,"I think this is a very good movie. I live and was born in a Spanish speaking South American country, I've been all over the US, where I feel at home (except in California and Florida which I don't like). I'm not a racist and I defend the rights of mexican, asian, black and other people who have become American citizens and adopted the American culture and English as its language. I think Americans have a right to defend their borders where illegal immigrants are pouring in as well as huge amounts of drugs and the potential danger of terrorist infiltration. I agree with the film's view that the national guards of every border state should be deployed to stop this. I just think that the main commentator in this movie should not be laughing so much as he does because the situation he describes is not laughing matter."
