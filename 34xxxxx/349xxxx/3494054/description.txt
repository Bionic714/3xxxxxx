From the website :
==================
Elephants Dream is the world?s first open movie, made entirely with open source graphics software such as Blender, and with all production files freely available to use however you please, under a Creative Commons license.

The short film was created by the Orange Open Movie Project studio in Amsterdam during 2005/2006, bringing together a diverse team of artists and developers from all over the world.

This is the high definition version
Check http://orange.blender.org/ for more informations and other lower quality versions (which I'll probably upload soon if requested).
