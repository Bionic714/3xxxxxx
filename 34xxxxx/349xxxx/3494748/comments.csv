,greywolf2312,2006-06-28T18:32Z,Cubase installation fails at 97% anyone any ideas
,greywolf2312,2006-06-28T19:34Z,"ooops comment withdrawn, closed down antivirus software and re-installed okay"
,betorrent,2006-08-10T20:27Z,"really good version, but there's a problem!!! it can see only ONE processor. I have a computer with 2 cpu, but it doesn't see both. 

probably you have removed too much from the original XP version.

PLEASE, make a version with multiprocessor kernel !!!

let me know."
,Bildernell,2006-08-21T19:08Z,I didn't make this version I' ve just uploaded the torrent. I've noticed that printing could be turned off as can't install my printer with this. Networking works fine.

,Drystonius,2008-08-30T02:33Z,"@AIMBOT

Just because you dont know how to config your Motherboard/CPU does not mean there is a flaw with the software.. just with your knowledge."
,Idisk,2008-09-28T09:02Z,how the f-ck do you install this ?
,caliwho12,2008-09-30T09:43Z,"excellent download n good set of programs, thamks very much. could use the wavelab serial number tho. cubase tends to not respond if i add around 6 or more mono audio tracks can n e 1 explain please whats wrong"
,hun_brian,2009-04-14T01:20Z,"This XP is skinned too much. It doesn't let you choose ""Standard PC"" install when you press F5. (Good to have ACPI disabled if you are serious about audio.) Also my WD hard drive doesn't work via firewire (it works otherwise). So I have to use it through USB which is quite a pain if your audio interface is also USB.
This version is convenient for the beginner/intermediate user, but I recommend getting an ordinary XP... and skin that yourself!"
