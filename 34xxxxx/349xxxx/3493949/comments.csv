,legalegel,2006-07-04T20:14Z,"this isnt a legal torrent no torrent is legal lol

there all illegal because torrent openers are.."
,Clockmender,2006-08-18T22:23Z,"Legal - you are a fuckwit, and you spell the large bird of prey EAGLE!!!!"
,lillesvin,2007-01-17T03:38Z,"Whether or not you like it, this infringes on a number of copyrights. Even though the composers are ""too rich already"", it doesn't magically make their rights to their compositions go away. At least you're recognizing the original composers, which is the least you can do.

Just so you know why I'm saying this... I'm a musician and composer myself and I don't care if people redistribute my songs and/or play/re-record them as long as they recognize me as the original composer.

I just wanted to tell you that this is definitely not a legal torrent.

Personally I'd be more interested in seeing some original work from you. I mean, playing with other people's compositions is one thing, but recording your own stuff and releasing that --- thus putting your own ass (directly) on the line --- is way more interesting both to yourself and the rest of us."
,Clockmender,2007-01-19T11:53Z,"It is legal - on the basis of the arguments above any child playing a beatles song at home on his piano would have to pay Lennon & McCartney copyright fees. Works by Joplin and Beethoven are out of copyright now anyway on account of the time they were written, works by myself are mine to do what I want with - check your facts next time Mr High-and-Mighty Music Composer. I am not making money out of this so therefore recognition of the genius behind the works suffices. By the way what is a person so hooked up on the morality of copyright fees doing on this site anyway?"
,Donkeylord,2007-05-04T12:54Z,Lol you go Clockmender!
,Clockmender,2008-01-25T17:28Z,"Well guys not ONE single comment about the quality of the work!!!! Is it that bad or are you all to lazy to comment? If I don't get some responses soon, in the comments that is, I am going to post some MORE work! - you have been warned..... I have some jelly, custard, cream, fruit and sherry and I am not to be TRIFLED with.

Cheers

PS will those of you (you know who you are), with the annoying predisposition to moaning (sorry about the long word) kindly stop bitching about the search engine - it works fine for peeps who know how to search and the products in this fine store are FREE for fucks sake!! Try sorting by ""Uploaded"", ""Seeders"", etc.
