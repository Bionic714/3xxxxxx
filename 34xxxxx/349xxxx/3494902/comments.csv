,VladimirMolotov,2006-08-13T19:36Z,I don't understand this file? I have a .nrg file that can't be opened.
,Turahk,2006-09-13T17:13Z,"VladimirMolotov

a .nrg file is a cd image Nero Burning Rom uses to make the cd. Basically you need to get Nero and just tell it to burn the .nrg image to a blank CD disc.

Hope that helps you out..."
