Fantastic three piece documentary about the Middle East: the Jews, the Arabs, the Communists, Spies, and a Mysterious Murder. English PAL DVD. The authors have a webpage: www.verafilm.cz

Excerpt from that page:

Czechoslovak republic was instrumental in creating and maintaining the political and ethnical instability in the Middle East which by now is shaking the whole world.
The small country in heart of Europe was getting itself involved in matters of former Palestine to such a degree that the developments of the conflict in the Middle East had a direct impact on its internal political situation as well.

Because capturing this history brings with it the admittal of sharing the guilt for the bloody events in the strategic region, much of the information contained in the documentary will be publicly presented for the first time ever. 

Enjoy... and SEED.
