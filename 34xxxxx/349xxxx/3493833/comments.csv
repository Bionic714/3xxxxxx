Find the location where u unpacked, and pic the .MDS file.. if u cant see it try to change the ""File Type""  to ""All Files"""

,Netmind,2006-07-26T11:49Z,"Got the same prob, but if u folow the instrucks it will work.. MOUT without EMULATION on D-Tools"
,efrz,2006-07-29T04:45Z,"Alright, for people who are having trouble with getting out of cars do this STEP BY STEP--
(USING DAEMON TOOLS TO MOUNT)

1.Right click on the Daemon tools icon (right hand corner, your tab bar)

2.Make sure ALL emulations are off, if not and you dont know how right click on the icon>Emulation>All options OFF

3.Now go to Virtual CD/DVD-ROM>Set Numbers of devices>2 Devices

4.Now that you have two devices go to Virtual CD/DVD-ROM>Device 0:>Mount Image>Mount the MDF file

5. After you have completed the installation before clicking finish to launch the game go back into Daemon tools>CD/DVD-ROM>(THIS TIME DEVICE #1)Device 1:>Mount Image>Mount the MDS file

6. Last step, now DONT CLICK FINISH just yet, go into Virtual CD/DVD-ROM>(Now you go to the spot where you mounted MDF, which is device 0)Device 0:>Mount Image>Mount the MDS

7.Now when you look you should have this

DEVICE 0: MDS
DEVICE 1: MDS"

You can't get out of the car because you don't have the original game. Probably your mouse controls are also not working properly. You need to get the original if you want to play. It's some kind of protection against the pirates. If you got original game try contact customer support."""""
