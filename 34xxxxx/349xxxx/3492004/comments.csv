,Garkan,2006-06-03T10:25Z,"Min första upload här på Pirat Bay, tänkte att det vore bra att stötta denna tracker såhär efter alla omständigheter.
Hoppas det fungerar att seeda, har lite problem att skapa torrent.

PS. Denna release (tros) vara nukad, men fungerar!
This release (maybe) is nuked, but it works!"
,Garkan,2006-06-03T10:27Z,*hade
[T],DasBot,2006-06-03T11:26Z,"Yeap, it is nuked because it is homemade."
,Garkan,2006-06-03T11:47Z,"From their latest update (fix) which maybe need for those use lower dirextx drivers:
""Idiots: The release we made is RETAIL and can't be
homemade since Steam doesn't give you the DVD.    
And even if there is a DVD, you won't be          
able to play it because the files are encrypted on
the DVD.""
Sorry DasBot, but looks like you have wrong."

Have they ever heard of decryption???"
,jjurvanen,2006-06-03T20:25Z,"decrypting.. I suppose you need key to do that and I think Valve won't be keen to give one out.

Decrypting without key takes like.. years? "

2. i copied the half-life 2 (original) (which should probably be in ur program files) to somewhere else. MAKE SURE YOU COPY OR U WONT B ABLE TO PLAY THE ORIGINAL HALF-LIFE 2 ANYMORE.

3. Then copy all the files from inside the Half-Life 2 episode 1 folder and paste them in the copied Half-Life 2 (original) folder. When it asks to replace stuff click yes and when its finished click start MS-DOS Batch File and it should work. hope this helped =)"

you can fix this by You can play Episode one with sound, like this: First, drag a shortcut from hl2.exe (the one in EP1 folder) onto the desktop; right-click on the shortcut and select Properties; at ""Target"", after the quotes, type ""-game episodic -appid 380 -novid"" (WITHOUT quotes and leave one space between the adress and this) then hit OK. Rename it HL2_Episode_One_WITH_SOUND. Drag another shortcut, but now type ""-game episodic -appid 380 -novid -nosound"" at ""Target"", and rename it HL2_Episode_One_NO SOUND. Now play with sound as long as you don't encounter a crash, and REMEMBER to SAVE THE GAME often"

,MaxMouseG,2010-08-01T07:58Z,Whats with all these damn problems I don't think I want to download this Garkan why you uploaded this without testing it?
,MaxMouseG,2010-08-02T22:14Z,"I decide to download and its just as some people said graphics are missing. As soon as Alyx told me to get my gravity gun from Dog and I didn't see it in his robot hands I stopped playing.

Not sure if jarman5 explained it right and thats why people are having problems but I did what he said sort of Actually I done this kind of copying before from Halflife 2 to a Portal RIP game. Luckily I  still had the original Halflife 2 downloaded. I copyed the original Halflife 2 folder called ""hl2"" to the Halflife Episode 1 ""hl2"" folder looks like it worked fine. Now I was able to see the gravity gun in Dog's hand. I'll come in here to let you guys know if I run into any problems during gameplay cause I plan to beat this game so I can go to Episode 2.

But dude seriously don't upload games that don't work for shit. Please test them out on your computer and multiple computers if you can."

,angelo_hernaez,2012-06-07T09:25Z,My game loads up pretty good up until theyre supposed to dig me out of the rubble and give me the gravity gun. all I can see is black except for my health display. Can someone please explain whats wrong and if there are any possible solutions?
,mavrix,2012-08-06T10:51Z,"Thanks

Unrared to a folder and fired it up straight away with no problems.  Halfway through with no glitches/errors/crashes on win7 64.

Didn't have to do anything extra, not sure if that's just because I own a legit steam copy of HL2 or what, but just stuck the extract in a folder and off I went.

 Much appreciated"
,kolschena,2012-08-18T04:16Z,"On the first level, ""Into the White Forest,"" the texture is missing when you look up from underwater. Then, after going through a tunnel and into the shack with the power cords and screens, Alyx won't follow me, no matter what I do. I got a different torrent after that, because it was impossible for me to get past the first five minutes of the game."
,kolschena,2012-08-18T04:20Z,"^FUCK nevermind, wrong torrent. This is for Dopeman's Episode 2 torrent"
