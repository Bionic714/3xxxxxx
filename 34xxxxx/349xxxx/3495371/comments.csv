Once I download another copy, I will be glad to seed it for a couple weeks.  Damned if there aren't enough leaches to bleed out a Balcoth."

,BandS,2008-07-20T16:32Z,"So, there I was.

Like a kid waiting for Xmas.

To finally get to hear, once more, the series that I remember listening to ""live"" each week on the BBC, nigh on 30 years ago.

Then it stopped.

At 47%.

That was 4 days ago.

I feel like a Balrog's whip just wrapped itself around my ankle.

I AM undone (and I'm fresh out of Lembas cakes).

Any chance of a seed? Please, pretty please?"
