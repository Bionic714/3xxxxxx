,Sysop100,2006-07-04T21:17Z,note: I have done some checking and this program process/pid when running uses port 3561 and 3562 to validate its registry info from the registration server. So I beleive blocking these ports will prevent unregistration as well. Then It is blocked regardless of what the server name is or its ip. I captured this data by running a netstat -b on a test machine running the software when a request was made. --- enjoy
