,nicoseco,2006-06-19T12:31Z,Thank you so much rodger!!! 
,mickflip,2006-06-19T13:44Z,"I installed it and scanned the bglman.dll for virussen but none found. Only I also have Cloud9 Schiphol - Amsterdam, but when I try to start FS2004 it says ''Error, you have an old version of Amsterdam, try to download a newer version at www.fscloud9.com""

Somebody can help me?"
,foofah,2006-06-19T16:43Z,"Get the cloud9 ams 1.02 update. And copy the cracked bglman.dll from LAX into the modules folder.

My problem is that the LAX scenery is completely missing after installation. It's one grey area with parked planes... "

,Murky6,2006-06-20T10:43Z,here you go i got a REQ: The A-4  Sky hawks (ALL OF THEM) h''p://www.razbam.com/
,ivod,2006-06-20T11:06Z,"It doesn't work for me either. When I paste the crack in the \modules forlder, I just get a grey area with no Terminals or taxiways. :(

It used to work before but I had to recover my PC, so now I had to reinstall everything and now it doesn't work. 8-("
,rrodger99,2006-06-20T13:21Z,"Make sure it is added in the the scenery library.

Also make sure it has been moved to the top of the list above any other add ons like Mega scenery"
,nicoseco,2006-06-20T14:19Z,"also make sure you delete the previous bglman.dll and bglman.dat on your modules folder before installing, hope that helps! "
,foofah,2006-06-20T14:29Z,"also make sure that there are 2 banana's in each ear, and that you blow on your thumb as hard as you can, till the banana's pop...

,mickflip,2006-06-20T17:08Z,scam
,foofah,2006-06-21T01:37Z,way scam... needs a ban as well
,ivod,2006-06-21T15:00Z,"OK, I got it to work. Here's what you can do if you have no terminals, taxiways, etc, but you only have a grey area with runways. First, go and check into your FS9\Addon Scenery folder. There you should have a folder called Los Angeles, or something similar. If you don't, go to your FS9\cloud 9 folder and you will see a folder called ""LOSANGELES"". Copy that and paste it in your FS9\Addon Scenery folder. It should work now. "
,DarkPilot,2006-06-22T00:19Z,"Ehm... you could be explained better? 
I only have the folder los angeles in folder cloud9.
Non in folder addon scenery.."
,ivod,2006-06-22T01:58Z,"then all you need to do is copy that Los Angeles folder from the cloud9 folder, and then paste it in your addon scenery folder. This should make it work. It made it work for me. "
,DarkPilot,2006-06-22T02:02Z,Tnk! :))
,rrodger99,2006-06-23T06:44Z,"@ tj090901

You must not be holding your mouth right when you install this then...runs fine on my computer & many others as well.

Don't come in proclaiming a fake before you have your facts straight."
,unlisence_pilot,2006-06-23T11:30Z,"thanks a lot
if you can,please seed,I'm starting to download it
the cloud 9 EHAM drops my FPS like shits! 
can anybody tell me if this scenery is heavy on frames?"
,rrodger99,2006-06-23T21:50Z,"*sigh

This is the reason uploaders quit uploading...

@tj090901

If you REALLY need proof this works I can post screenshots. Those that have reported issues have had other Cl*sigh

This is the reason uploaders quit uploading...

@tj090901

If you REALLY need proof this works I can post screenshots. Those that have reported issues oud9 bglman.dll modules installed & much like the FSD C-337 the installer may not work correctly (I had the FSD Navajo installed & that kept the c-337 from installing correctly.)

If you reviewed Ivod's helpful post you would also see that the installer may not set the scenery.cfg correctly & you have to add the scenery manually through FS2004. If you have MegaScenery Socal installed you have to make sure the LAX Photo is disabled & that this scenery is higher in the hierarchy than the MegaScenery."
,rrodger99,2006-06-23T21:59Z,"1 more thing.

If you updated from the Cloud9 web site the scenery will not work. They have updated the bglman.dll & it has not been cracked.

If you are having issues with a file most of the group here involved with FS2004 will be more than happy to help...much more than other groups that I have seen but do not come in stating that a legit file is a fake or that the uploader is trying to scam (implied).

This is the original file from before the raid uploaded by b-744, 1 of the most reliable sources here & it was gotten off of usenet as posted by TheFlyingDutchman, THE most relaible source on usenet.

Demonoid is looking better & better each day."
,DarkPilot,2006-06-24T02:06Z,"nothing to make, tried and tried, also the sistem by Ivod, adding by hand (but already were added from installer the voice in the scenery) changed the bglman but it is not visualized well.

,atomicbanana,2006-06-26T12:54Z,Could anyone please upload Cloud9's F-104 starfigher? Pretty please?
,mickflip,2006-06-28T12:33Z,"Since a few days there is a patch for Cloud9 Schiphol Amsterdam (EHAM) with addon manager 1.020 and this Los Angeles crack (bglman.dll) is version 1.019 or something, so that isnt working toghether! Or install the default v1.02 Schiphol version cause thats also some 1.019 addon manager version. "

,FL280_DCP,2006-11-24T19:28Z,PLEASE SEED
,PilotMilad,2007-11-24T23:24Z,"Why does every cloud9 product say: ""Trial version has now ended"" when I've installed the crack and everything?"
,GoldenScimitar,2008-05-15T01:41Z,"The real problem is this:

There are no complete Cloud9 or FSDreamTeam downloads in TPB under the same BGLMan crack. So basically, even if I install 2 sceneries from Cloud9 that are under the same BGLMan, if I tried to install another Cloud9 airport available from TPB with a different BGLMan version, then that particular one will work, but the other cracks will be overwritten, making it hard to complete a full Cloud9 collection.

My request is, ALL Cloud9 sceneries under the SAME BGLMan crack. Please respond back to this. Thanks."
,737man,2008-05-26T03:22Z,"I don't know what I'm doing wrong but I have followed all the instructions, and I still just get a big gray area.
Can somebody help??

,stikahfingaz,2008-09-26T08:18Z,it works... just make sure guys that you UNINSTALL your past cloud9.. including your registry.. and never update the scenery. works fine. thanks a lot roger. 
,the deed,2010-06-10T11:18Z,@stikahfingaz HOW do you clear the registry then????
