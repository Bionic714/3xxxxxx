Cloud9 KLAX v.1.00

Do not update!!!!! It will cause this scenery to not work!!!!!

Yea, Yea we have all heard about the "trojan" in everything from Cloud9. I have it installed & there are no logs from my router or port manager showing ANY outbound attempts from anything after the install.

If it worries you that much....this download may not be for you.
