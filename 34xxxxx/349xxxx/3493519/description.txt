In this remake of the 1989 arcade hit Altered Beast, players take on the role of a special military operative that's been sent to investigate a deadly genetic outbreak in a small coastal town. Operating alone and with minimal information, it's quickly realized that you're in for an all-out battle of survival as your character is hunted by unspeakable horrors and haunted by a mysterious past. The only thing that can save you from fate is the dark power that resides within you -- the ability to transform into a variety of powerful beasts like the werewolf, dragon, and Minotaur, as you hack, slash, and claw your way through the worst nightmare imaginable. Available only in the Japanese and European territories.
