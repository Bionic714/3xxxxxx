Firmware driver for Maxtor DiamondMax SATA II hard drive model 6H400F0. If you have problems with detecting of this drive connected to NForce3 or NForce4 chipset, try this to solve the issue.

Maxtor does not provide this driver directly from their website, you have to be very kind to their technical support to obtain this stuff. This way it is better.
