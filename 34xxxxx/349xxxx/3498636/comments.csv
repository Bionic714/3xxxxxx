,SketcHacker,2006-07-14T08:13Z,"I think like 2 games are not isos, they can be made into isos with umdgen but they are presetup with some hook boot shit that will still let you play them. the rest are all isos. there are some thats rips, some thats full. like tomb raider, full game. metal gear novel, full. 
I think i only have 2 games that fit on smaller cards like lumines rip, and fired up rip. but theres the full fired up in there as well.

Like i said though, theres a portion of games that i prefixed so try them before you mod them.

,swillynswilly,2006-07-15T07:26Z,i know outrun is 600mb iso. havent checked out some of the other ones..........hey whats the name of the program for the psp that lets you load 2.5 or 2.6 games with the fastloaders. i had it but i lost my memory card now i'm having a hard time finding it. i think the name of it is Genesis.i think you need it to load some newer games. in case anyone needs to know ive been using hook boots and iso for along time so i know what im doing. thanks for any help
,TrinitysHell,2006-07-15T23:58Z,This might seem stupid but how do I upload the game into my memory stick in my psp? I got as far as unpacking the iso using PowerISO but after that I'm totally lost as to I have to do to get it playing on  the PSP
,SketcHacker,2006-07-16T05:50Z,"First you dont unpack the ISO. you just nzip it from the archive then place iso in the ISO folder on your mem stick. in order to do this you have to have a psp 2 pc usb cable. less then 5 bucks at places like wal-mart.

Also, all i use to boot all of these games is ""Fastloader 0.7"" ""Devhook ANY VERSION"" and ""Dax Ziso Loader""
nothing else. go to either psp-hacks.com or pspupdates.qj.net and check there forums, theres full packages that come customized the way they need to be with proper files. loaders n shit."

If you really would like some help, go to psp-news.dcemu.co.uk

They are the best on the web. Be sure to search before you post though.

Ok, so I'll write up a mini guide:

If you have a PSP version that is 3.10 (not OE-A) Then you cannot play these games...yet.

If you have a PSP 3.03 (Again, not OE) or lower, see the above website for details ^^

If you have 3.10 OE-A, put the ISOs (after extraction) into G:\ISO (Where G is the letter that your PSP gets when you go into USB mode )

Daxter should be 1.30 GB (1,405,845,504 bytes) not 430MB.  Content has been ripped out the one included in this Compilation.

Ripping content out of game is something people used to do back in the MODEM Dial-Up days.. were in the 21st century with Broadband connections no need to release games with content missing.

Now it makes me wonder how many other titles in this compilation have contents ripped out of them."
,Kingen2,2007-05-04T20:10Z,what is the keygen for world rally 
,notyoursavior78,2007-05-29T06:55Z,"Analog-X is right! Game 108. Final Fantasy & Dragon Quest - Jap is Itadaki Street Portable and it's missing files. Give me a break! I found another torrent for that game but it isn't downloading anymore. That's the only game I want otherwise I'd just buy the UMD games. I just don't feel like importing that one.

Why make people download incomplete and possibly corrupted files is beyond me."

,vitriol1991,2007-08-14T11:56Z,"Oh, there's only one. Add the trackers from the other version of this torrent to your tracker list and it works better.

Additionally: Lumines gives an 800XXXX error on 3.52 M33 and under Devhook. Doesn't work."

,flo1989,2007-09-11T12:06Z,"which downloaders do you guys use?
I use FlashGet and so I can choose which games I want and which I don't want but it's still going to take days to download all of it, unless I do one by one...

oh, and for pspnurd...if you want just that one game then...get FlashGet (it's free) then click on download and when it asks you which files you want, just click on them.

By the way, what is seeding?"
,DogNo7,2007-09-20T01:00Z,"I found myself liking about 5 games out of the entire collection.  A lot of the foreign titles just didn't do much for me.

A good US Domestic collection, of the titles available in the US would be useful, as would a collection with some sort of List and Description of what the games are.

Personal opinion?  I really don't know whether this collection is worth the time and disk space it takes to download.

-DogNo7"
,DogNo7,2007-09-20T01:03Z,"Ignore my last comment.  It was referring to another collection.

The titles in this collection are worthwhile.

,original_jtb,2007-12-13T02:16Z,"This is an excellent upload.  The games work for me with the exception of a few but I am doing it different because I have a custom firmware on my PSP.  If you have a dark alex custom firmware (I believe I am running 3.52 maybe?) you just unrar the files and put the iso or cso file in your ISO folder on the PSP and amazingly they play.  So far my only dissappointment was that tokobot didn't play, it starts but then fails to load but I am probably doing something wrong.  Great job on the upload sketch!  Thanks seeders for seeding this big bitch!!!   XD  92% done!  Keep it up and I will seed for a while as well.  "

,Qcphot,2007-12-24T09:53Z,"Dont know if the files got corrupted along the way, but out of a sampling of 9 downloaded games only one RARed file actually works with RAR, and that's a dinky 14mb Pinball game.  All others give me an error from RAR ""The archive is either unknown or damaged"", and YES, my RAR works fine.

I wont even talk about of bunch of games stuck at 99.6%

This Torrent smells; all the 'good games' stuck with 006% left,, most wont open...

Goodbye suckers!"

,xDonnyx,2007-12-31T02:55Z,I just finish downloading and will be seeding for a least a week. and just like original_jtb comment most of the games worked for me except for a few that didn't. Oh and for the sports game fans sorry I didnt download those games.
,Siggens,2008-01-06T22:21Z,please seed the remaing 0.6%... The speed was so good until it suddenly stopped.. 
,biglou18,2008-01-07T00:02Z,"please seed more im stuck at 99.7%, it has been at 99.7 for 5 days now, it started really fast and all of the sudden it cannot get past that point."
,IOError,2008-01-08T10:59Z,"Don't need most of these but nice share... 

For the few people who have issues... The customer firmwares have an option to allow you to boot ISO files using the M33 Driver. Just push the select key when you are in the main menu and a little menu pops up... Or if that is too confusing and you have put the ISO/CSO files into an ISO folder on the root of your memory stick then just stick ANY UMD in your drive... This works fine for anyone running custom firmware. I have these games running on a PSP slim with System Software 3.71 M33-3 which absolutely rocks...

Oh and to the idiots who keep complaining about the need for a Pandora Battery and jigstick if you don't want to use that go ahead and visit your local gaming shop and buy the f@#king games... Whiner babiers... You have to use a PB+JS for a total of 1 minute so borrow one from a friend if you don't know where to buy one. :P"

,flytagart,2008-08-15T05:19Z,"alright kids, after a ton of reading I think I found a solution to the ""the archive is either in unknown format or damaged"" error.  Try installing a different torrent client, and re-open this torrent file. then close the program and copy the old ""corrupted"" files into the new folder.  What I found is the so called completed files were actually not done, they were reporting wrong.  I was using Azureus and I switched to BitTorrent.  Worked for me.  Hopefully this works for you guys!!"
