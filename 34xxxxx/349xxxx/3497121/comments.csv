,TaLLaL,2006-06-23T11:09Z,I download in 930 kb/s now but it's only for a little while I think because it doesn't seems like anyone gets he last part

There is only 14.00 MB to go. . . I really doubt you'll get into some sorta trouble by your isp for that small amount."
,meetlat,2006-06-24T10:22Z,"ok ok i wil seed, but the first with 100% needs to seed to !"

,SilentShadow,2006-06-25T01:17Z,"Hey all i just finished watching this... its the real thing and the full movie... video and sound qualitys not bad... only problems with it are that most of the subtitles are cut off, kinda hard to see in the dark areas of the movie, and as expected a few disturbances by the crowd but not man. pretty good torrent. just wanted to let yall know."
,meetlat,2006-06-25T10:12Z,"Ok i will seed for that 3% again, and now you know its the real thing."
,LittleX,2006-06-25T14:32Z,"ok, 1 problem, i can't watch it because all the time the image flickers, lines apear and just stops sometimes and i can't do nothing, the only player that i can see something with is VLC, i think i have a codec problem, what codecs do u use?"
[V],MeanCruiser,2006-06-25T23:25Z,"TNX
