,technon00b,2006-06-28T06:20Z,"i will upload it myself, and dont worry ill see how i can make it an iso, i am more than willing to do this for anyone that needs help"
,technon00b,2006-06-28T06:42Z,"ok, i have just one thing to say, i promise that my releases will be good and i will always seed, only until another has completion of it, if i see that ppl dont seed my uploads, im sry but i will stop doing this for you guys, not to be mean but you know"
,technon00b,2006-06-28T07:28Z,"hey guys, anyone have alias for xbox? ive been trying to download but it has like no seeders, plz? any help would be appreciated"
,technon00b,2006-06-28T07:39Z,ok gringo first ill need to know what program you use to burn your games
,technon00b,2006-06-29T00:29Z,"ok, the way i burn my images is using alcohol 120, i NEVER get any problems with any of my games, you can download that and use it, but if you need to know which file you select to burn it is the mds, and just in case you dont know, the mds-mdf, is just a cd image, so like i said, select the mds to burn and it will all do the rest by itself, if you plan on using alcohol just let me know and ill tell you how to do it with that"
,technon00b,2006-06-29T20:09Z,"cool, just notify me when you have finished downloading it and it would be greatly appreciated if you seed for a couple days"
