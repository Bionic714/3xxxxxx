Since Mysongbook stopped their sharing of tabs cause it was illegal, even if you took out the songs by ear, I have had big problems getting some songs, Only way was google to search for example ""Blitzkrieg Yngwie Malmsteen Guitar pro"" And it took long time before you found it on a good site. ;D
THANKS ALOT!!"
