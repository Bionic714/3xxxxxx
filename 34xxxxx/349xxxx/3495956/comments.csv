,rubberball,2006-06-18T22:43Z,"Sorry for the last post...i got it working...i apparenty had a older version 8.0 installed not the latest version 10.0..
If i would have read the error message it does state visit the winzip website for more info and when you do it says you must have a older version installed.

I have now got version 10.0 and its rocks..

Once again thanks cipprio"
,AgentSmith.,2006-06-20T06:26Z,"yup, had to update winrar to the newest one...and now it works great. thanks."
,rubberball,2006-06-20T20:15Z,"Hello there

Many Thanks for the great update.
I would like to know how/if it is possible you can use the scenery setup utility which comes with Gatwick Pro because when i try and turn down the settings a bit or make any adjustments it does say ""Job Done"" but when i go out of the program and back in the settings havent changed..??
No worries mate if you have no info about this or dont understand what i mean....like i said many thanks for the crack anyway its just a bit to much for my pc and i would like to turn the settings down?

Kind Regards Paul"
