,extrudedplasticdingus,2006-06-27T01:42Z,"It seems to be about as well-seeded as you'd expect a Tom Waits record to be now.  Moments after I made that last comment a couple people finished and left it open, so I left it up too."
,crustykid,2011-10-15T00:26Z,"i would say this is tom waits' best album. les claypool produced this, along with playing in a few of the tracks. its more gritty and aggressive than any of his other works, which have mostly been sad/depressing.

thank you for uploading this."
