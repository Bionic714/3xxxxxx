,hackthex06,2006-06-10T17:22Z,What region is this?? This didnt work on my xbox which is NTSC. Is this the full ISO???
,bigbeam,2006-06-22T23:52Z,"please keep seeding,been looking for this one for a long time.
THANKS!!"
,hackthex06,2006-06-23T22:11Z,just to let you know this wont work on an NTSC console but to make the fix extract all the files from the iso and then use a hex editor to change an offset in the default xbe
,hackthex06,2006-06-23T22:14Z,use Hex Workshop 4.2 and open the default xbe and use the little flashlight at top and search for this line in hex  182D4454FB2109400100. Now change it to this 182D4454FB2109400000 changing the 1 thats third from the right to a 0
,hackthex06,2006-06-23T22:16Z,Now just go to file in the upper left corner and save as and chosse the directory of the original default xbe. Now type in default.xbe and click OK and overwrite the old one when it prompts you to.
,hackthex06,2006-06-23T22:20Z,"Now use CXbox tool to remake the ISO choosing ISO creation . Then choose the directory that has the default xbe you just made and all the folders and click start. Once done burn with DVD decrypter which I use, Now it will boot on an NTSC console. You also can use CXbox tool to extract the files from the ISO as well."
