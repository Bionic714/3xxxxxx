Dark Colony by Strategic Simulations, Inc. (SSI)
------------------------------------------------

Released in 1997. This file was originally made by a group called "The Frenchkiss". Tho apparently their either closed or moved or somewhat, so just uploading this as I saw it requested in some comment.

For anyone not familiar with the game, it's prolly not worth downloading if your out to get a exiting and advanced rts game along the lines of Generals or Act of War, tho  at least the cutscenes is at least in my opinion way ahead of their time^^
