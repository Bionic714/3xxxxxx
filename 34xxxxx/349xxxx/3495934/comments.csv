,Bjens,2007-02-27T16:02Z,"Heh, I didn't think it would last this long tbh^^

Your prolly right in that the intro isn't in there, I realised only after uploading the rar file that I have the game on a disc somewhere too, which sorta is needed to play all those awesome gory and gritty cutscenes. ^^ Searched like mad for the disc to reupload but.. can't find it:( The rar ought to work tho at least, I played it a couple days before I made the upload."
