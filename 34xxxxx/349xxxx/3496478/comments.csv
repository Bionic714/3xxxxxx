,Mr_Ecks,2006-06-19T17:16Z,Thanks... this hasn't been broadcasted in Sweden (probably never will). I like Rollins so this just can't be bad... Thanks too for the DivX encoding. My stand alone eats DivX/Xvid and even mpeg... most of the time. Only way to be sure is to make it DivX Home Theater.

This has become one of my favorite shows."
,afro2000,2006-06-20T09:11Z,"Big up to BadServo one mo' time for comin' through with this release! Oh, yeah!"
,noddy93,2006-06-20T13:39Z,"Thanks a ton for this. It's a real treat as IFC is not available to me.

I don't suppose any of you kind folk could re-up the two episodes that were over 700MB in a smaller size? I'd love to archive them to cd."
