A heavyweight cast of voice-over talent (Ralph Fiennes, Julie Christie, William Hurt and Ian Holm) breathes life into this animated version (using the claymation process) of the greatest story ever told. King Herod, Judas Iscariot and Mary Magdalene are all on hand to play their parts in the life story of Jesus Christ. Particularly effective is the imaginative use of flashbacks. Well Worth watching!
