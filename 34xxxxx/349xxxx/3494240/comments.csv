,drteeth,2006-06-10T10:43Z,Looks like some bible-bashing fundi has invaded Pirate Bay!
,bucky katt,2006-06-10T12:05Z,"No invasion, if you were a regular uploader then you would realize that the pirate bays torrents were all lost in the raid. They needed to be uploaded again so they can be properly tracked by the people that have been surviving off dht for the past week. Enjoy the movie :-)"

great movie"
,Esmad3,2009-06-08T14:47Z,Notice that all bucky katt's uploads r from 2006. That's because god stroke him down for dicking around with his holy works. Now he's in hell but thats ok. All part of the great design.
