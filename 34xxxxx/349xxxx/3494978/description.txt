Ration-it is a program that lets you limit the ammount of time someone can be on a computer. At 5 minutes remaining, it issues a warning. At 1 minute, it issues a final warning, then it logs them off. You can require it to be logged on to be logged on to the computer at all, and the process can not be killed from task manager. Very useful for those little kids always taking over your computer ;)
