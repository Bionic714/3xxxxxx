,psylynx,2006-07-22T23:48Z,"Kent Hovind is one of the top in his specialty, 
not even in evolutionary circles does any one agree with the other.
Just listen, and think for yourselves


...at least Yoshimi got something right, there is no santa claus"
,RokemSokemRobot,2006-11-06T05:24Z,"DeeX22... Thanks, for the video! Very cool!

I'm seeding this for as long as I can, which should be a long time, as I am doing for several other Hovind videos.

This video is .ISO format so, the only way I can watch this, is to burn the files to a DVD, and watch it on TV. The big plus for DLing this video, is that it's a smaller file, than the other Hovind videos, and if you don't have a way to burn .avi files to a DVD so that it can be watched on TV, this video might be the way to go.

The other Hovind videos are .AVI format, so, most ppl will be able to watch them on their computer.

There's another creation/evolution video I'm seeding by Dr. Walter Veith, who is a scientist, and is a former evolutionist. Great seminar and info! The file is,""Creation_Series.DVDRip.XviD-zXc"", it's HQ, and the screen size is (640 X 480), and .avi format. Dr. Veith's site is at www(.)amazingdiscoveries(.)org/

P.S.- I'm not with either ministry, but I think, everyone deserves to think for themselves, and decide what is truth, and what is a lie!"
,Fuckface Frankie,2007-02-12T23:26Z,"LOL!!
This guy is hilarious.
You have to be religious to buy this bullshit.
May he rot in prison.
10 years must be an easy stretch with his time perception."

There is nothing that science can do to refute the evidence put forth in this video.

You bashers of creationism should really take the time to see ALL of the evidence before saying anything. :P"
,spartan777,2007-07-02T01:48Z,"I am ashamed to say that I used to be a creationist. I've since come to terms with science. I'm still a Christian, but I realize science and the Bible don't have to contradict.

psylynx; Hovind is a criminal, not a scientist, or intelligent person at all. he's full of bullshit and doesn't deserve anyone's time."
,demuffinman,2008-10-13T05:10Z,"FELLOW CHRISTIANS: Carefully examine what you teach for proof of creation and WHO you lift up.

First, Kent Hovind continuously uses known fallacious and shaky arguments.

Second, his personal, unrepentant conduct has only hurt the main focus, that is evangelizing.

,Jonny645,2009-08-30T03:55Z,"""Usually, even a non-Christian knows something about the earth, the heavens, and the other elements of this world, about the motion and orbit of the stars and even their size and relative positions, about the predictable eclipses of the sun and moon, the cycles of the years and the seasons, about the kinds of animals, shrubs, stones, and so forth, and this knowledge he holds to as being certain from reason and experience. Now, it is a disgraceful and dangerous thing for an infidel to hear a Christian, presumably giving the meaning of Holy Scripture, talking  nonsense on these topics; and we should take all means to prevent such an embarrassing situation, in which people show up vast ignorance in a Christian and laugh it to scorn.  The shame is not so much that an ignorant individual is derided, but that people outside the household of faith think our sacred writers held such opinions, and, to the great loss of those for whose salvation we toil, the writers of our Scripture are criticized and rejected as unlearned men.  If they find a Christian mistaken in a field which they themselves know well and hear him maintaining his foolish opinions about our books, how are they going to believe those books in matters concerning the resurrection of the dead, the hope of eternal life, and the kingdom of heaven, when they think their pages are full of falsehoods on facts which they themselves have learned from experience and the light of reason?

Reckless and incompetent expounders of Holy Scripture bring untold trouble and sorrow on their wiser brethren when they are caught in one of their mischievous false opinions and are taken to task by those who are not bound by the authority of our sacred books.  For then, to defend their utterly foolish and obviously untrue statements, they will try to call upon Holy Scripture for proof and even recite from memory many passages which they think support their position, although ?they understand neither what they say nor the things about which they make assertions?.[1 Timothy 1.7]""

,mulisha05,2010-10-27T07:20Z,"So if Dr. Hovind is indeed a quack or his seminars are all bull and you think you know better then he does, you must be quite knowledgeable. So let me ask you one simple question... wheres your proof to debunk all of this. If you actually listen to the words that he has spoken they are extremely accurate and in just one video have more background validations then a lifetime of scientists can comprehend. My friend most groups reject this man because they are scared of losing there public stature and economic income. So let me hear your lecture on why this man is a quack or his %100 proven facts are bull? "
,DeeX22,2011-04-06T03:46Z,"it has now been 5 years since I posted this... I describe myself as seeking truth and am not very religious.  I am so amazed at how many people judge this purely as a religious video....

I am reminded of this 
Proverbs 18:13
He that answereth a matter before he heareth it, it is folly and shame unto him.

 Hey... I sat through AL GOREs mountain of crap and propaganda and assessed what HE had to say.... even Michael Moore... who did have some interesting points>>>> but the way wrong conclusions.

In retrospect, ideas are important... please watch ""V for Vendetta"" if you are unsure... or re-read the Constitution ... before you lose the last (second) amendment we have left.

Peace out...
