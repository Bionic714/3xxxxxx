Download and install OFW (Official Firmware) 6.39 In YouTube write: PSP 6.39 PRO-B7 download it and in PSP press the 6.39 Upgrade and then PRO-B7. Every time your PSP reboots (From battery, crashes or you turn off by holding the PSP by holding switch), you will need to launch PRO-B7 again. Happy hacking ^^"
