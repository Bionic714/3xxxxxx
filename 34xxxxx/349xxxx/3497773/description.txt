

           CachemanXP is a system service designed to improve the

           performance of your computer by optimizing several

           caches, auto-recovering RAM and fine tuning a number of

           system settings. Auto-Optimization makes it suitable

           for novice and intermediate users yet it is also

           powerful and versatile enough for computer experts.

           Backups of settings ensure that all user modifications

           can be reversed with a single click. Due to the system

           service nature it requires Windows NT4/2000/2003 or XP

           to run, uses minimal resources and virtually no CPU

           time. The help file includes a screenshot based system
           
           performance guide.
