[World of Warcraft, fun Teamspeak session]

They are back! This includes Razorgore encounter.

There's a good chance you are already familiar with "Dives," a World of Warcraft player with an extremely colorful way of leading end-game raids using TeamSpeak. Otherwise you might be wondering why people keep repeating "50 DKP Minus!" in game chat. Dives plays on a European server in a guild called Wipe Club.

Extremely fun listening. Enjoy.
