Patched Streambox VCR suite 2
version: Streambox VCR 1 beta 31

The unpatched version of Streambox VCR requires you to register with a central 
server, and queries this server on each download attempt with the user info. This 
version does not converse with the Streambox server, removes all restrictions on 
recordable content and restores the ability to record realaudio RTSP/PNM streams.

This software allows you to store the Windows Media and Real Audio streams. It is 
not yet developed due to some offends from the side of streams publishers.
