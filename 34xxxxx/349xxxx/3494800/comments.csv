,Shylock,2006-06-15T06:15Z,uhm...your telling yourself to seed?
,costanetto,2006-06-19T05:56Z,"Please, anibody can seed? After I will seed
at least 4 times! Promess!"
,CanWire,2006-07-01T23:53Z,"This is the worst group of books as a whole to propogate to minds that could be subject to religions loosely tied to reality. Mind control, how to build a UFO, and about 30 on the interpretation of dreams... It seems there are a lot better things to concentrate on in life, to bury oneself in video games is a similar pastime from my perspective. Not intending to be a flame, I just am trying to probe for thoughts coming the other direction."
,Drudwy,2006-07-13T16:31Z,"how about someone posting a book list that isn't blank? whenever i click on the view files button, the list is empty."
,Drudwy,2006-07-25T19:05Z,"well, for myself, there's plenty of useful religious material, but then, i AM a type of pagan, so.... yeah. it's got some stuff of use.

i will readily state, however, i do not believe in the vast majority of that stuff, the grimorum are what i am after :)"
,DrutterFun,2006-08-01T18:51Z,Hey CanWire write here what in your opinion is not a waste of time. Im just curios cuz I have nothing to do and don't wanna waste my precious time thx
,going4it,2006-09-06T01:21Z,"Thank you for this fantastic collection, I can't wait to start!"
,waqar singh,2006-09-18T06:56Z,any1 got ebooks by the author Michio Kaku... on the subject of theoretical physics.
,bengtsalfa,2006-10-27T14:39Z,UFO:s? Mind control? I'm in!
,AngerVent,2006-12-02T23:02Z,"hell yea, thanks a lot man, alice bailey books are the shit, ive been trying to find ponder on this, and serving humanity, for so long, its also nice to have the other pythos book, i have an earth dwealers return on hardback but havent been able to find the others so this torrent kicks so much ass, anyway thanks for the great torrent, ill seed for as long as i can. "
,raf999,2006-12-05T00:12Z,"You people dissing the books as ""crap"" (they are pretty good actually- lots of unusual stuff or books that cost big money on Amazon and so forth) are pretty ungrateful. Dayoung, thanks for the books man, great torrent."
,zardoz7026,2006-12-16T16:51Z,I suspect that many of the people who believe this stuff are also Scientology cultists.  OOPS.  I meant that they belong to the CHURCH of Scientology. (that label provides tax-free status)
,zaza1851983,2007-07-22T02:45Z,"thnx very much man, you are the king"
,nemesis.tyrant,2007-07-31T21:41Z,"thank you, there's a lot of interesting things in this torrent @@"
,rr_sookoo,2007-08-06T06:46Z,"Can't believe I wasted my bw on this. dayoungn, you should put the list - or give us all an idea of the books. Warn us dammit."
,kippensaus,2007-08-15T13:14Z,thx
,rc71,2007-08-22T10:10Z,"zardoz7026 
Actually the IRS classifies them as a cult.  They still get tax free status.  Just like the Mormons."
,jaybee276,2007-09-11T17:22Z,A lot of people say that most hobbies are a waste of time. Ok maybe they are! Some people say that messing with computers and pirated s/w and movies is an even greater waste of time. Let me tell you all now that messing with this download and reading it all is taking a waste of time to new limits.
,ErsatzSemblance,2007-09-18T08:50Z,"First off, Dayoungn, thanks for the up.  Second, to all of the negative people, stop your bitching.  At least Dayoungn actually upped something.  From what I can see, only one poster on this page has upped something.  I get so sick of people bitching about other people's torrent when they themselves don't bother to up something.   To the other people that don't like the books here: We get it, you don't like it. That doesn't mean EVERYONE won't like it.  If you don't like it, don't download it, plain and simple."
,frozen_dude,2007-10-07T04:11Z,":o Looks like a EXTREMELY diverse collection. I think most of these are worthless to me (but as the saying goes: one mans garbage, is another mans treasure.).
I do see some nice gems in this trove tho... mmm, The Devil's Dictionary, always wanted to read that one."
,jrocca,2007-11-07T19:22Z,Hey everyone if anyone downloaded this recently keep it seed ... i am very interested in this kind of read
,saintmule,2008-03-10T03:52Z,"Dayoungn: thank you for the up load, some cool stuff in your torrent"
,themostoriginal,2008-03-15T06:12Z,magic mushrooms!
,Psychlode,2008-05-10T06:01Z,"It's....uh....esoteric..... yeah, thats it.
Thanks for taking the time to share it with us. "
,dr4v3n,2008-10-16T08:43Z,What kind of fuckin books are these. This must be a hippie who just got a computer.
[T],Devin,2008-12-31T03:20Z,"A nice collection overall, and those of you who don't like this kind of book, remember that there is knowledge for knowledge's sake. Just because it might not be useful to you, doesn't mean you shouldn't learn it. If nothing else but for the allusions cast by other books about this."
,silenceispain,2009-01-20T00:40Z,Quantity over quality here.
,mamboze,2009-01-28T10:33Z,"This collection is strictly for the credulous and the gullible. For them, it could be the start of a great library. For anybody who values reality, this stuff is useless. "
,mamboze,2009-01-28T14:40Z,"This selection would be a god send for somebody wanting to start or enhance a collection of the offbeat religious, spiritualist, occult and crank literature. But as a serious contribution to the history of knowledge, forget about it. "
,garyd98105,2009-01-30T10:26Z,Oracle for dummies files have spyware detected by Stopzilla.
,Lichblade,2009-02-10T10:11Z,"The only thing in this list that seemed worthwhile to me was ""The Devil's Dictionary"" by Ambrose Bierce. 
I didn't even bother to download that because I got a copy from my English teacher for Christmas four years ago."
,Zenowa,2009-04-11T23:45Z,"For those who can't view the files before downloading (and ancient request from TigerLiu):

,indiaman,2010-01-01T17:26Z,"Zenowa-first let me thank you for taking the effort to list all the books here--and it's definitely a long list.
I don't know if I'll download any of it but just wanted to appreciate your unselfish service."
,MOVNGFWD,2010-01-25T03:13Z,"I second that... much appreciation, Zenowa!  "
,JasmineT,2010-03-06T21:20Z,Just got The Devil's Dictionary out of this...but GR8 effort..Thanx :)

,sarjan_friends,2010-04-15T13:32Z,great collection
,quazx12,2010-05-26T13:19Z,A pile of useless garbage for nutters. This should be aptly renamed as a pile of useless garbage for nutters. Thank you and see that it's done you raving nutter.
,Sikarium,2011-02-26T05:50Z,"has a few good ones, but much of it could have been compressed to a single RAR (i.e the dozens of pot books). Also while there may be over 1500 files, many of them are duplicates.
thanks for the up, tough."
