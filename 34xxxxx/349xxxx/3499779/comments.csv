,Shrikey,2006-06-30T14:14Z,LOL @ mr Ian
,miekkailija,2006-06-30T14:15Z,No they aren't! You havent try them! One game named Dink Smallwood is allmost same as Helbreath and Theres Gta versions 1 and 2!
,El Jafar,2006-06-30T20:11Z,"I have only tested two of them, Doom and Duke Nukem 3D and they were great games when they got out on the market.

But Mr Ian and darth_tater seems to have tested them all. Impressing! Because I hope you two really have tested them all and don't just talk shit all the time."
,H4rdR0cker,2006-06-30T23:47Z,Offten old games are good the games of today you can play onces and then get bored of them.I think mr ian and Darth_tater are to young of age to udnerstand the power of the games 10-15 years ago.
,SoundWall,2006-07-01T00:25Z,"GTA and GTA2 rocks!

Also, Duke Nukem 3D is the BEST FPS ever made in my oppinion, though only the demo is included in this torrent.

miekkailija, maybe you could have left out the shareware games, otherwise it's a pretty neat torrent. Gonna have these games a try."
,gangstax,2006-07-02T12:10Z,All these games are great!
