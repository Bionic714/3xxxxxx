,twicked,2006-06-20T16:36Z,Most files are M4A format.  Use Apple iTunes to play or google 'm4a to mp3' converter....
,UnReAlAnTiDoTe,2006-11-22T15:41Z,"I'm looking for one song from this band called ""Sitting at a Bar"" anyone have any ideas or have this song?"
,twicked,2006-12-03T08:44Z,"Sitting at a bar is on the Southern Discomfort album.  Which is included in this torrent.  The tracklist provided is for the tracks that have NO NAMES, ie: Track 001.mp4 is actually Intro for Straight outta Rehab.   Something like that."
,crackymcrock,2007-09-05T20:45Z,seeed it!!! i'll keep it open for a bit after it's hard to find
,monkiesatemybaby,2007-10-10T23:40Z,"Just started this... it's showing 13 hours remaining with 1 seed and 1 leech. I'll seed for a week as usual if it works OK. Thanks for the awesome upload, it's nice to see some obscure stuff show up, but it only works if the new guys d/l ing seed until someone else gets it. "
,twicked,2008-02-05T14:56Z,"I definately agree, guys.  Surpisingly, for this band to get SO many downloads is amazing.  This has been downloaded a freakish amount of times and various different servers and I find it a bit upsetting to say the least to find that you guys are not seeding.  There is no excuse for this.  If you like it, seed.  I seeded this beast for over 2 months.  It's been over 2 years now since release and it is still thriving.  Craziness."
,sthprkn64,2008-03-14T20:27Z,What do you expect? They've got great lyrics. Let these artists thrive!
,alecsputnik,2008-04-14T06:17Z,"someone put this as mp3, not m4a, label the tracks, and reseed.  this band is cool, but seriously, putting this up unlabeled as a format not primarily used is pretty sucky."
,r00ted,2008-07-09T03:51Z,"thank ya all for the upload and seeding.  I'll let it run for a bit, to get atleast 1.1 ratio ^^

I heard the bar song on the radio here and was like whoa!  I gotta try all their shit ^^
"
,r00ted,2008-07-09T06:26Z,"another question.  Any idea why Musicbrainz lists so many more tracks for ""To Whom it may Consume""?

This torrent has 8, but MB shows like 25 tracks."
,ImissNixon,2008-07-11T00:13Z,"somebody get sittin' at a bar, please, and thanks."
,assmunch3,2008-09-06T05:02Z,"fucking awsome band, reminds me alot of twiztid. never would have heard of them if not for the bartender remix (with hank williams jr.) . thanks twicked."
,msncs03,2008-11-18T18:45Z,they all work great...even has the sittin at a bar song I was looking for THANX!!
,aphrodisiac420,2008-11-29T05:06Z,"""to whom it may consume"" has tracks on album that have talking or only intro-type stuff, maybe that's why the listings are different?"
,Thearkaneblaze,2009-03-30T06:46Z,"I wish people were not stingy and would seed this, been on 99.3% for 2 days now."
,twickedwild,2009-04-25T04:00Z,"lol, sorry guys, I uploaded this years ago.  Nowadays of course I'd do it better... I think I have them all in MP3 format.

If there are tracks missing, I apologize for them.  I got all the songs from Brooks Buford himself immediately after Rehab broke up, then later when he hooked me up with his new album.  I bought Southern Discomfort and Graffiti of the World.

Also, on the Southern Discomfort CD is a video thats like 30 mins long or more, has a bunch of music videos and is all around pretty cool.

When I re-up this I'll include that video, but in the meantime if you wanna look for it on the net it was called ""12 steps to rehab"" I think."
,twickedwild,2009-04-25T04:01Z,"lol, someone stole my old account, btw. lol"
,ubrmnsch,2009-06-12T08:15Z,"considering it's the only one on tpb, nice 2006 discography."
,ubrmnsch,2009-06-12T23:53Z,"gah, although their are mislabeled tracks. first one I played, Hey Fred, is actually Sittin at a Bar, but Sittin at a Bar on the same album is the same song, so it's a duplicate."
,ubrmnsch,2009-06-13T00:21Z,"my bad, it's musicbrainz mislabeling shit."
,Artacon,2010-09-16T22:56Z,"Missing ""Sittin' at a Bar"" not the song the album"
