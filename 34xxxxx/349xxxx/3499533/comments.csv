,Rezinunts,2008-04-09T18:55Z,"Ok....I've already downloaded a Devil May Cry 3 SE through a different torrent but it turns out that it's not in english....Looks like it might be Polish or something...Anways, my question is if this is an English language version. The language it's in really should be in the title or description."
