,rrodger99,2006-06-05T02:52Z,"@ Rexxxifon

I don't need commentors that cannot read. 

""So don't complain....if you want it, get it.....if not just move on.""

Also just because you didn't want it doesn't mean that someone else didn't especially given the 178mb I have uploaded on this torrent.

Also having gone back to 04/30, I don't see any of your uploads so until you start uploading don't come into any of my torrents with negative comments."
