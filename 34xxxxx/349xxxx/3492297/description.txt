EDI 737-200

Yea....it's freeware from Flightsim Pilot shop.

The only reason I am posting it is it's a decent plane & to keep others from going through the lengthy  registration at flightsim in order to get it.

So don't complain....if you want it, get it.....if not just move on.


Keep the blue side up
