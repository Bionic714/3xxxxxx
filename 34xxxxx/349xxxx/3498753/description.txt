The nation?s top reggae acts have united to produce a CD collection that will hopefully stop the music pirates from taking bread right out of their mouths as they?ve been doing for the past several months. The pirates have been selling copies of masters stolen from the studios and radio stations as well as poor quality versions recorded off the radio. Now there's a legally-made, well packaged sixteen-track collection featuring some of the best locally produced reggae songs of the day from a line-up of popular artistes.

Entitled Reggae Road Block, the CD has been produced on the Caribbean Music Group Label and features songs from the likes of Khari Kill, Prophet Benjamin, Isasha, Queen Omega, Benjai and Mr. King. The CD is expected to hit stores on Friday 9th December on both the local and international markets. Also in the works is a Reggae Road Block CD collection, of which the second CD should be available within coming months.

Tracks on Reggae Road Block include; ?Pretty Boy?, ?Usual Suspect? and ?Coming From Moruga? by Prophet Benjamin, ?Don?t You Know? by Isasha; ?Picture Of Selasie? and ?Jesus? by Khari Kill; ?Oh Laventille? and ?Old Dog? by Mr. King;? Got Something? by Benjai; ?Politricks? by Queen Omega and ?If I Didn?t Love You? by Juicy and ?One Family? by Million Voice.
