,sinsliveforever,2006-06-23T16:33Z,i guess you havenÂ´t start seeding? or i hope anyway..
,R1SENFA17H,2006-06-23T21:13Z,"I've begun seeding and I will continue to for as long as it takes to get a good number of other seeds in place. I'm basically using this torrent as a way to help get my down/up ratio over 1. Considering the fact that I'm currently at 0.490 (according to Azureus) and I've downloaded ~700GB, I think it's safe to say that this torrent will be seeded for quite a while. I hope people want it as much as I do."
,PHsname,2006-07-28T12:14Z,"for some reason, it wont continue downloading...it stops after i leave it for a minute or so, saying its complete...it's like stopping itself.  help?"
,R1SENFA17H,2006-07-30T20:10Z,"@ PHsname

What BT Client are you using?"
,R1SENFA17H,2006-07-30T20:12Z,"One thing you can try is deleting the torrent (not the data though) and re-downloading the torrent. That should force your client to re-check the integrity of the data and prevent it from prematurely saying ""complete""."
,cliohotaru,2006-08-20T22:49Z,"This is an excellent file! Thanks so much for seeding it! Perfect quality and in it's original (well... as original as an Americanize Anime can get anyway).

FYI, unzipping takes almost an hour."
,R1SENFA17H,2006-08-22T02:03Z,"I'm sorry about that, it took a very long time to compress on my 3.0GHz P4 also. I thought that it would be more appreciated if I made the end file as small as possible. In hind site, I would not do that again. It only saved 3-5% disk space and does not allow people to download the individual files."
,zomigod,2006-10-27T03:05Z,"Is there any way to get around my computer capping my downloads to 4 gigs? It keeps giving me a FAT32 error about the file size and asking me to save it somewhere else, but I have no where else to save it to. "
,dueledge,2006-11-08T14:59Z,Is this the unedited version of Outlaw Star or the edited version?
,darkzealot89,2006-11-14T06:20Z,PLEASE SEED!
,dueledge,2006-11-14T18:44Z,Is this the one that Cartoon Network dubbed and edited or is it the unedited dubbed version? It has the episode which I think cartoon network didn't show so I assume it is the unedited version.
,R1SENFA17H,2006-12-01T04:38Z,This is the unedited version.
,MagusRogue,2007-01-09T16:50Z,Someone please seed! I'm stuck at 67%!
,R1SENFA17H,2007-01-15T13:31Z,"Wow, I guess that more people wanted this than I thought. I've uploaded 700GB for this torrent already. I'll keep seeding as long as people want it. "

,DavidGX,2007-12-22T05:07Z,"It's been very slow going with this for me. Sometimes there will be a seed or two, then other times nothing. It's taken almost a week and I've only gotten 84.9%. I'll be happy to seed this for a good solid week if someone else can simply help me get the last chunk."

,T3MUL3NT,2008-04-07T03:24Z,"Hey everyone, I'm at 60.6% on this and i'm only downloading at 6 kb/s for some reason and allowing everyone else to upload off me at no limit. So I'd appreciate someone increasing their upload speed, it would only be nice.

,flashpoint93,2011-03-08T20:42Z,"Be careful DL'ing this one guys. Fenopy Fakefinder says its a fake. plus all the video's are in a RAR.
Big red flag, IMO. Videos still work and play flawlessly though.

check the hash for yourselves

,TekLok,2011-05-11T02:46Z,The file is corrupt I can't extract the videos at all.
,RipOrDie999,2011-06-17T18:47Z,"RARed torrents suck, unless you trust the uploader and know that you want the entire torrent. 

There are un-RARed copied floating about on other sites, if anyone else feels the same way that I do about this torrent. "
