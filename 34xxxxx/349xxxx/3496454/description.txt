Vancouver's community channel's "Urban Rush" team goes on a great visit to the SG1 studios in Vancouver.  (That's B.C. Canada & why there are so many cracks on the shows about all the mountains & trees on all the planets they go to.   ;D )  It's the most relaxed, fun & friendly show I've seen so far.  It's worth seeing just to see the loving, ear-to-ear beaming smile of pride of Christopher Judge with his delightful little baby daughter.  The show was originally aired late in '05.

Sorry!  The cable picture wasn't clear to begin with (they've had so many requests for repeats of the show I think its wearing out) so it's definitely not as crisp as it should be & filters just seem to make it worse.  And I gave up on delogoing or cropping the news & weather (which was wrong as usual - a lovely sunny day) banners as doing so made the picture even fuzzier.  If you want them off, you'll have to do it yourself.   :)
