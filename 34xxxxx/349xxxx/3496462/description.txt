The second music video collection I felt in the mood for putting together.  Again its a hodge-podge of various styles & artists, ranging from the whacky to the hmmmm.... to the sumptuous.  26 videos + 2 mp3's.  I'm not fond of little, low quality videos, when I watch them I like to enjoy them in full screen so that's why you get only 26 for your almost 700 MB's.   It's my party & I can make 'em how I like 'em.  :D  I'd appreciate knowing if folks want this type of video collection - size, the variety, etc - so I know whether to keep uploading them. 

Enjoy!  But also SEED PLEASE! so others can enjoy too.  Ta!
