,bucky katt,2006-06-10T12:08Z,"No invasion, if you were a regular uploader then you would realize that the pirate bays torrents were all lost in the raid. They needed to be uploaded again so they can be properly tracked by the people that have been surviving off dht for the past week. I am far from a new uploader."
,bucky katt,2006-06-10T17:25Z,"I can see why people would think that, sorry for not including the info that these were being re uploaded with the post."

I remember the original TV series vividly, and Robert Powell's performance is still probably the most memorable portrayals of Jesus anywhere."

,bucky katt,2006-07-09T09:33Z,Time should not be an issue they have already been seeded internationally and will probably remain available as long as the bit torrent network is around.
,Taishotono,2011-02-13T14:46Z,I want to thank you for keeping the Yashua of Nazar film up and going. Even with oodles of pictures of girls after breast implants trolling away on the Pirate Bay advertising. Im sure they are seeding the film as well. Now that the Katt is out of the bag. I must say this is one of the best films on the Greatest story ever told.
