how is the dvdr work"
,Abstracta,2006-06-04T17:43Z,"Master0404,
Yes, it is a DVDrip (DVDR). Most of these come as an .iso file, ready to be burnt. "
,bananaboy,2006-06-04T19:43Z,"NoNoNo. These are not DVDrips, they are full DVDs. The R in DVDR stands for Recordable. It is a standard for writing DVDs with a device much like a CD-burner, just that it is a DVD-burner. So the file is not ripped, but it may have been shrinked to fit on a single layer DVDR. Please read http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvd-r for more info."

,torremen,2006-06-06T21:42Z,DUTCH ONLY !
,Defpax,2006-06-07T19:58Z,"Yep.. Only dutch language and subtitles... :(
Thx to people for sharing, but downloading 4Gigs of junk because the description is wrong pisses people off...."
,ksoktogon,2006-06-09T13:52Z,"Only Dutch language and subtitles. It's a pity that I haven't seen the comments earlier... I'll delete the movie, I cannot understand a word..."
,chivers,2006-06-22T19:44Z,English speakers should see the version in French with english subtitles.  The music and words are competely different from the US version.  If you can't get the english subtitles look at the French version anyway.  I have seen both and the French version is 100% better.
