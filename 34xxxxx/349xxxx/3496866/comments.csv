,Goglu71,2006-06-29T00:10Z,"Is it just me, or are there really a lot of you *stuck* at 44.4% ?  I went to look at the peer list, not a single one above 44.4%.... "
,Knakkerpak,2006-06-30T11:16Z,"I got 45.8% now and no seeds. I think the seeder, as much as we appreciate this release, is not always online.

I'm patient as long as the chance exists the torrent gets finished"
,gdmsndmxr,2006-07-01T02:01Z,Please seed......I get about 48% and that's it.
,Bigadz,2006-07-04T20:29Z,"Errrrr think we are all stuck at 47%! Please can you complete your upload, looking forward to this movie, much appreciated"
,Rzza,2006-07-06T13:46Z,"Seed please, still on 47%"
,Knakkerpak,2006-07-10T11:58Z,I found the same movie on another torrent site. Also a DVD9 of the unrated version. Now I just hope it's the 2006 release :D
,BearCat,2006-07-25T07:46Z,"Supposedly there are 6 seeders now, but I can not see ANY of them :-("
,Pettto,2006-07-27T23:48Z,usually don't complain but this is waaay to slow seeded........isn't worth the wait.
