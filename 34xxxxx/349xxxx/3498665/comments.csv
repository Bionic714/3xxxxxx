This firmware gives your router the ability to function as a client, DNS server, adjust power output, gain fine grain control of firewall features, and many many more things. Really, there is no reason to use Linksys firmware with this out.

Good luck, I'll be seeding it for a bit, esp. if people are interested."

thanks"
,njmike150,2008-07-03T07:59Z,"It amazes me that a company can get firmware (in this case) then change the version, release it as their own and start charging for it.  It just boggles my mind.  I have the source to Netscape explorer v 6.1 amoung many other products I've collected over the years, which I will gladly sell you for $20.00 dollars per copy.  OK, keep  a straight line, no cutting, whose next?"
