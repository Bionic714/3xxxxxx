Phone virus? That's new.  What might be even less likely is the fact that they are Java J2ME, typically a 'secure'-ish mobile java subjet.  Please explain what you mean by this.  "

,noppe9000,2007-02-18T17:09Z,So there is a virus in the .exe file. Well you should not put this on the phone anyway since the S-E phones does not understand .exe files. When it conserns the virus on the phones it is more a symbian problem which you can find on high-end Nokia phones. J2ME does not work in the same manner as symbian. Symbian is great for some issues but has the virus problem.
