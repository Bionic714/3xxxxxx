,piratebill,2006-06-10T08:16Z,"Would this person like to tell us WHY he or she thinks we should be banned? - you know, that is why YOU claim THE RIGHT TO FREE SPEECH by slandering someone else's torrent posting, but want to deny it to US and presumably therefore everyone else?"
,piratebill,2006-06-10T09:31Z,"PS on reflection, looking at the arrowheads attached to p-mod's comment, it may be that he or she was referring to the spammer above. If so apologies, and don't anyone think badly of p-mod, who may have turned out to be a good citizen after all."
,vper1,2006-06-10T18:18Z,"Hey bill, I do think he was referring to the spammer. Also, when the servers were taken down your torrents might have been inadvertently taken down as well. Appreciate the work."
,piratebill,2006-06-12T08:30Z,"NOTE: there was originally a spam website posting above p-mods comment, which the website administrators now appear to have deleted."

,enjoyeverymoment,2011-12-22T18:57Z,"22/12/11 the COMPLETE works are being seeded right now. I decided to seed it all instead of just individual ones because I believe seeding the whole collection will allow everyone will be able to get the pdf they are looking for and keep it all in one organised, easy to search, easy to seed torrent. http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6905797/Sam_Fryman_Complete_Works_Nov_2011_PDF_E-Book"
