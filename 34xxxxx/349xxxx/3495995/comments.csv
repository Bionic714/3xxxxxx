I just added thislast night  to the list of movies I need to see. You have impeccable timing.

Anyway, thanks for the upload!

I'll seed till I hit at least a 5:1 ratio."
,jgabriel,2006-06-17T19:28Z,"P.S. If you can still edit the description, please add the *** freakyflicks *** tag to the bottom.

A lot of people on TPB place it at the top or bottom of the description for art films, cult films, and good non-english language films. I'm pretty sure the people who search for the ""freakyflicks"" tag would be interested in this movie.

,Josy,2006-06-17T20:40Z,"My ""control panel"" doesn't allow me to do that. I can't get into ""editing"" to add the *** freakyflicks *** tag. All I could do is ""delete"" the torrent, which I'm not, of course! 

Sorry."
