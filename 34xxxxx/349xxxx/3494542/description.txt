Internet Security Systems' BlackICE Server Protection application offers professional strength protection for Web, file, database, or application servers. By merging advanced intrusion detection with a commercial strength firewall, BlackICE provides a powerful one-two combination to guard server-based information against attack or misuse.

BlackICE Server Protection's intrusion detection capabilities automatically detect and block malicious activities by monitoring all inbound and outbound traffic passing through the server. Users are instantly alerted of an attack, and can easily identify the source and the method being used. Once an attempt is detected, BlackICE Server Protection automatically blocks traffic from that source so that the intruder is no longer a threat. BlackICE Server Protection also provides exhaustive reporting on attacks common to servers, such as CGI script access.

BlackICE Server Protection delivers bulletproof protection, with defenses against specific attacks directed at Windows NT or 2000 servers. BlackICE Server Protection detects, identifies and blocks attacks before they can compromise a system. Protect your home network or small office with BlackICE Server Protection. BlackICE Server Protection's award-winning technology:

# Protects servers by scrutinizing all traffic into and outfrom a server, constantly on the lookout for suspicious activity and ready to aggressively defend against attack
# Blocks malicious activity from the source of the attack and denies improper access while leaving legitimate traffic unaffected
# Alerts users attempted attacks and logs all suspicious activity so that sophisticated users or service providers can identify and neutralize the threat at its source
# Secures dial-up, DSL, or cable modem Internet connections 24 hours a day, 365 days a year

BlackICE Server Protection also now features Application Protection, an exciting new feature designed to shield your PCs, laptops and workstations from hijack by an attacker, and protects you from Trojan horse applications, worms and other destructive threats.

BlackICE's Application Protection quickly and invisibly defeats dangerous programs that attackers deliver through instant messaging, email, or even your Web browser! BlackICE stops these destructive programs before they do harm.
