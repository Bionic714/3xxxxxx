Stargate Atlantis - cast & studios visit by Urban Rush DivX.avi

Once again the Vancouver (B.C. Canada) community channel's "Urban Rush" team visit the Stargate studios.  This time to chat, play & explore the sets of "Stargate Atlantis" with cast members Joe Flanigan (Major John Sheppard), Torri Higginson (Dr. Elizabeth Weir), David Hewlett (Dr. Rodney McKay ), Rachel Luttrell (Teyla Emmagan), Paul McGillion (Dr. Carson Beckett) & Ex. Producer Brad Wright.  Again, as with "Urban Rush's" SG1 visit, its all very relaxed & a lot of fun - also again not the quality I'd like but I've given up on our cable company getting it fixed.

And, no, it's not ice & snow here as you can see in the outside shots.  <g>  Those temperatures are Celcius not Farenheit - the beaches are busy.  :)
