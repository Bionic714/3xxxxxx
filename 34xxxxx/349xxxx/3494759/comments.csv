,kjellemann,2006-06-15T12:27Z,No Seeders? Please Seed.
,JER79,2006-06-17T18:07Z,Stuck at 99.4%
,Layana,2006-06-18T00:31Z,"Same here. Stuck at 99.4%. Seems noone has been able to get 100% of the file yet, so we can't help seed."
,Karelian,2006-06-18T12:48Z,It would seem the KoDP.nrg file is corrupted or broken.
,Machete82,2007-12-25T00:24Z,So anyone got it to work?
,linglingtopher,2008-07-31T13:09Z,"It's not corrupted for me.  Came down just fine, and the zipped NRG CD image works fine in Alcohol.

Some brief testing seems to show the game plays just fine.  I haven't tested long, but, if I find that the release is problematic, I'll come back here and post about it.  As it stands, great release of this rare gem, and thanks, jmard5!"
,Turcca,2010-03-16T20:17Z,"NRG -file mounts on demon tools, and I can play it from the ""CD"". But if I try to run setup, there is an error:

""Setup is unable to find installation lanuages in \SETUP.LID file. Error 105""

Can't patch without installing, which is a bit of a problem. I actually had this game bought some ten years ago, but lost the CD. Damn good game, if I can't get it again, might try to buy it again."
,Turcca,2010-03-16T20:24Z,... might be a problem windows x64. Anyone got the game working on it?
,Turcca,2010-03-16T21:26Z,"All right. So I didn't get the game to work on Win X64, but after installing win2000 with Virtual PC, it's working fine.

,Brougal,2011-10-05T18:07Z,"It also works fine when you used ""play from CD"" option"
,JacobyFirox,2012-04-11T23:04Z,"Hey. If you copy the files on the .nrg file when you mount it over to a separate folder and then copy the files in the update into there required locations, then it will work perfectly. That's how I did it anyway. Hope this helps!"
