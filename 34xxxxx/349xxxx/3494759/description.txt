
Overview

King of Dragon Pass is the saga of colonizing a magical land. You control the future of a ragged clan which has decided to settle the empty land of Dragon Pass. Your decisions determine whether they prosper over the course of a century, and whether they will be remembered forever as a great clan. 
Of course, yours isn't the only clan which has emigrated to Dragon Pass. You will have to cooperate and compete with other clans of your own people, as well as folk you know nothing about. Each has their own personality. 

Your goal is to become King of Dragon Pass, uniting all these people through diplomacy, magic, and battle. (The objective for a shorter game is to forge a tribe and remain king for ten years.) 

The game is set in the magical world of Glorantha, explored in detail through the games Hero Wars and RuneQuest. This provides a rich background not seen in most computer games.

Notes

- KoDP.nrg is a Nero image roughly 495+ MB. You need Nero to burn the game into a CD.
- I WinZipped all files getting one 280+ MB zip file.  I am not sure if it was a good idea compressing a Nero image.  It did significantly lowered the download size though. Just post if the game does not work and I will re-upload the uncompressed Nero image file of the game.
- Enjoy the game.
