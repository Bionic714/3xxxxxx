,GRADE*ONE:DFM,2007-09-25T14:59Z,Thanx Tatty. My tape got chewed up years ago and couldn't find any Neds anywhere. Will keep seeded as i know how hard it is to find an active torrent of these. 
,starksworld,2008-04-16T15:17Z,I can't express how excited I was to find this.  I've been trying to find a copy of Grey Cell Green every year or two for a decade.  I will be seeding this one.  Thanks Tatty!
