Dennis Hopper and Diana Rigg star as the biblical Samson and his nefarious lady-in-waiting, Delilah, in this retelling of the age-old story. Gifted with enormous strengths that also leave him vulnerable to the selfishness of others, Samson soon learns what kind of person Delilah truly is. He must prove himself a hero during his darkest hours by avoiding Delilah's wily ways once and for all and staying true to his God-fearing spirit.
