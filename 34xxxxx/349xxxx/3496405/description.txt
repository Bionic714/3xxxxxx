The Fog of War: Eleven Life Lessons from the Life of Robert S. McNamara

One of the best documentaries I've seen in the last few years.  McNamara, of course, was appointed by John F. Kennedy to be Secretary of Defense.  His tenure lasted on into the Johnson adminstration.  I've always heard him characterized as the architect of the Vietnam War, and now you'll get his point of view.

To me, the most memorable moment in the film is when McNamara admits he could've been tried as a war criminal for his role in firebombing Japan during WWII.

Enjoy, and please seed.

I got this from Suprnova just after the DVD was released, so thanks to the original sharer (wherever you may be).
