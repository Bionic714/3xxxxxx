,Haruni,2008-08-02T06:33Z,The most impressive war film I've ever seen.  Should be required viewing for any American.

,spidr_mnky,2009-03-02T17:31Z,"rar format means that in order to both watch it and keep seeding I have to keep two copies.  If you left the DVD rip in .iso format, or a video format, I could watch and seed from the same copy.  DVD's are compressed by default, so rar accomplishes nothing beyond keeping the files from being directly accessible."
