BACK FOR THE FIRST TIME was nominated for the 2002 Grammy Award for Best Rap Album. After the runaway success of his debut INCOGNEGRO, Ludacris answered demand for a follow-up with BACK FOR THE FIRST TIME, his Def Jam South debut, which features many of the same cuts as the former album, plus three new songs. Here Ludacris continues his mission to get bodies shaking, both down South in his hometown of Atlanta, and beyond. The remix to his hit single, "What's Your Fantasy," features two of the sassiest girls in hip-hop, Foxy Brown and Trina. "Southern Hospitality," and "Phat Rabbit," give hip-hop a taste of what Ludacris has got cooking for his next outing.
