A great classic game by Team17.

"Worms is a series of turn-based computer games developed by Team17 Software. Players control a small platoon of worms across a deformable landscape, battling other computer- or player-controlled teams. The games feature bright and humourous cartoon-style animation and a varied arsenal of bizarre weapons."(wikipedia)
