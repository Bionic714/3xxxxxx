Dr. Shiva's lecture was part of the Scripps College Humanities Institute's Fall 2003 
program "Poverty." The Program in Science, Technology, and Society of the Claremont 
Colleges was also a co-sponsor of this event. 

Dr. Vandana Shiva is the founder and director of the Research Foundation
for Science, Technology and Ecology RFSTE), based in Dehra Dun, India.

Since 1982, the foundation has focused on protecting people' s rights from
threats to their environment by centralized systems of monoculture,
forestry, agriculture and fisheries. Dr. Shiva's goal is to conduct research
"with people, not on them" to create a greater understanding of "the interconnections 
in the web of life." 

Aside from her work with the RFSTE, Dr. Shiva has also written a number of
books, including Stolen Harvest, Ecofeminism, Breakfast of Biodiversity: The Truth 
about Rain Forest Destruction, Biopiracy: The Plunder of Nature and
Knowledge, Staying Alive: Women, Ecology, and Development, and the recently published 
Water Wars: Privatization, Pollution, and Profit.
