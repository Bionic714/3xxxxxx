 i made a mistake and put the wrong mix up on the last torrent,
 
http://thepiratebay.org/details.php?id=3495690.  I shouldn't have put that mix up, 

it was one just for us so theres an extra bonus for you piratiers, it's the 

harder version of the summer mix :). so the track listing is incorrect and is for 

this mix, duh. That mix will not be put up on the site in the near future. :)

if you want the track listing leave me a message.
