SINOPSIS: The reason Lugosi's lines as the monster were deleted was that the writer, Curt Siodmak, hated the way Lugosi sounded and hated his accent. But the
blame was not Bela's, but Curt's. Siodmak knew going in that Lugosi was playing the monster and that the monster's brain had been replaced with Ygor's--and Ygor had a Hungarian accent. The truth of the matter is that Siodmak could not write dialect to save his soul--his dialog for Ilona Massey (Bela's fellow Hungarian) is also curiously flat and lifeless. They cut Bela's lines to appease Siodmak--a rather recalcitrant person to work with, from all reports--but obviously couldn't cut Ilona's as well. All they succeeded in doing was muddying the movie and insulting Bela's fans. Good job, Curt! As for Eddie Parker, darn right he doubled for Lugosi in the action scenes. Bela was around 60 at this point and not a stunt-trained actor. Actors half his age didn't do a lot of their own stunts, much less actors who also had severe back problems and resultant sciatica.

This film also marks the beginning of the "whiny lycanthrope" period of Chaney's career. All he had to do was confine himself when the moon was full and his life would otherwise be pretty normal. Instead, we get the "I just wanna die" moaning we will have to endure through several more films. Curiously, I thin this may have had an impact on Chaney's personal outlook as well; his career and life was just as much of a downward spiral as Bela's. Bela had his pills and Lon had his bottle.
