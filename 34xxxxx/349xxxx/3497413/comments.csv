,longhairedluver,2009-03-04T05:16Z,Where in Finale do i find the User Code that i can use to generate the serial code?
,Foshkey,2009-08-05T15:14Z,"Just to clear things up:
first off, the keygen is NOT a virus. 99% of the time virus detectors will say keygens are viruses. It uses virus technology to generate keys. So it is a virus, but not a harmful one.
install finale and when you first open the app, it will ask you if you want to register. Click on register now and register BY PHONE.
This will give you the user code. Type this in the keygen (remember: ALL CAPS) and it will give you the serial and auth. code. type these in the registration and you should be good to go.
Hope this helped out some people"
