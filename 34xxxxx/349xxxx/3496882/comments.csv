,DKqw,2007-01-04T16:13Z,"Can someone explain to me the lineage of the files in this torrent? 

I ask because I (like a good consumer) purchased the album after getting the torrent. But a lot of the songs are different on CD. For example, Everything's Just Wonderful has huge changes, like a tambourine over most of it and different breaks in the the beat. Also, on the album version she say nothing about having AIDS at the end of Knock 'em Out. Others like Alfie seem unchanged. 

Is this torrent mistakenly a collection of demos? Cause I like the versions in this torrent better than on the album, they just sound like crap cause they're 128kbps."
