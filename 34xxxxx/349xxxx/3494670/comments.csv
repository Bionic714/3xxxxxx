,linkdup,2006-06-11T21:55Z,sorry all these are advanced
,ripper_gonzales,2006-06-11T22:34Z,arnold1965: you forgot to mention that you'll have to pay money at your posted website. PB is free and that's worth a lot more than your piss site. Why don't you just crawl up your own rectum and disappear.

However, I still don't get it to work. :-K"
,buriwww,2008-04-08T08:38Z,"Thanks for this torrent, works great, no prob with installation.
Here's what I did:

1.  Run and install ""setup_XSI_6.01_win32.exe"", leave everything the default setting.(you can change the path where it will be installed at). Don't run the program yet right after it is installed.

2. Go to Start>Program>Softimage>License manager

3. Click ""Edit config file"", scroll down and you'll see this:

----------------------------
# Select the port the dongle is connected to.
# The IButton driver (tm321_32.exe) must be installed in order to use the iButton port.
# Sentinel dongle on serial port: COM1 or COM2
# iButton dongle on USB port: IBU
# iButton dongle (DS1413) on serial port: IBZ1 or IBZ2
# ETX: DONGLE_PORT is ignore for ETX DONGLE_TYPE
DONGLE_PORT=IBU
----------------------------

change the DONGLE_PORT=IBU to DONGLE_PORT=COM1
then click save. Close License manager.

4. Go back to the folder where the original ""setup_XSI_6.01_win32.exe"" is, you should see a crack rar there (""spm1414-win32-crack.rar"").
Unrar everything to the directory C:\spm
Choose yes to all to overwrite the files.
**note: make sure you unrar the cracks to the folder, not just unrar it somewhere else and then copy paste the files to C:\spm, because there is an important hidden file in the crack that you might miss**

5. Go to Start>Program>Softimage>License manager again, click server>install license server service.
Now click the ""Start Server"" button underneath.
At this point I got a pop up warning about time and date or whatever, I just ignored it and clicked ok.
After that close the License manager and you can run Softimage XSI smoothly."

I can't find the License Manager, and I've searched the XSI folders like an idiot. Where can I find it? :S

Thanks in advance!"
