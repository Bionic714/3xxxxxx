,RosaPanter,2006-07-13T19:50Z,vad pratar ni om? det är ju en kass kvalité men den ***** grön rand längst upp och resten av bilden är också kass!!!
,nicko2112,2006-07-15T06:01Z,"Superb, original film!!! I hated brosnan until I saw this!!!"
,hyvet,2006-07-18T23:11Z,aXXo ThA MaN oN TpB!! Keep up the good work

,RetardedPuppy,2006-09-04T04:32Z,The quality was perfect. The movie was great too.
,mintcar,2006-09-19T18:12Z,Good movie
,T. Russell,2006-09-20T09:28Z,"All of aXXo's contributions I have, so far, found to be excellent.However, I've noticed that he has no leading role as actor, director,screenwriter or producer in any of his films,etc. In actual fact all this very skillful gentleman does is enable every person on the planet with access to the internet, to download visual entertainment of a very high standard.

So, all you cocksuckers with adverse criticism should be aware that we that appreciate his efforts realise that you're just somebody's bitch!

Bye for now....  "
,Rotegutten,2006-10-25T17:41Z,"Nice up axxo, tpb is too good for you :P"
,aegense,2006-10-27T10:59Z,"The quality is very bad on my computer. I wonder if I need a special codec. I have installed the latest version of K-Lite codec pack, so everything should be fine. But the colors are strange. Black and white with a redish furnish and a green line in top of the picture. I have had similar problems with other moovies."

,ranapuree,2009-06-15T23:17Z,Thanks axxo! I agree with nicko2112. The only Brosnan I've seen that was worth watching. 
,vivatpb5776,2011-04-01T02:41Z,Quality is very good for a DVDRip. Thank you uploader.
,beckiibubbles90,2011-09-20T14:52Z,"I love you. 
You always upload really good copies and they are (from what I have seen) always AVI.
You rock ^^"
