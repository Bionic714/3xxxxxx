Gosh, how we all miss that good old Thai Weed in New York."
,The_Pilot,2006-06-26T09:23Z,"This is nothing to do with ""Weed"" or getting high. This is a kids show about a superhero school that floats in the sky hence the name ""Sky High"" lolz"

The text is totally out of sync and is totally useless because the guy who released the ""corrected"" sub just forgot to test it before he released it..."
