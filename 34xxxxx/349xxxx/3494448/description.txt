This is the fan-edit of Star Wars EpI by Magnoliafan

According to this page:

Balance of the Force is a re-titled version of The Phantom Menance edited by someone using the name "MagnoliaFan"?a reference to the screenname of a notorious opponent of Bluntman and Chronic in the movie Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back. This is a darker version of the film that follows many of the previous fan edits, re-dubbing and subtitling aliens as well as droids so they speak their native language.

A short list of the changes to the film include:

* Alternate title and crawl, giving more history on the Jedi, Republic and Trade Federation 

* The plot has been altered from revolving around taxation to slave labor 
Jar Jar is dubbed and subtitled. He is now a pompous, Han Solo-like character, who believes he saved Qui-Gon's life by dragging him down and thinks Qui-Gon owes him a life debt 

* The Gungans now hate the Naboo because they stole a Gungan relic, the "Kyber crystal", from them, explaining the big glowing globe at the end of the film. The crystal was first mentioned in the novel Splinter of the Mind's Eye, although it was spelled Kaiburr 

* When Qui-Gon tries the mind trick on Watto, Watto becomes much angrier, throwing Qui-Gon out and shouting, "Get lost! Come back when you gotta some money!". Also, as Qui-Gon embarrassedly exits the shop, Jar Jar knocks over a bunch of stuff and Watto shouts, "Hey! You break it, you buy it! Eh?!" This is one of Watto's lines in Star Wars Episode I: Podracing for N64 and PlayStation. 

* Many scenes have been resequenced with music from other films, including cantina music from Star Wars, and the Imperial theme from The Empire Strikes Back
