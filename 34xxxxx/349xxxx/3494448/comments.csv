,jumbotron,2006-10-07T14:23Z,"There is so much to recommend this edit, so much work has gone it to it and many little details show a true love of Star Wars. The Phantom Edit, which removed the truly awful parts of the original, only served to show that what was left was still unwatchable drivel. The technique of dubbing the alien characters allows for a much more robust plot and the removal of the more annoying speech of the original - the battle droids no longer say ""Roger Roger"", and Jar Jar is foul-mouthed, conceited, and a JOY to watch.

Choice quotes: ""What is to become of Jar Jar?"" ""He will be pounded to death."" and during the podrace ""Go, you little bastard!"" So, it's not a version for young children, and the picture is slightly less contrasty than usual and the sound is fairly low, but these are tiny quibbles. In all it's wonderful, it makes a gem from a very rough stone. If you love Star Wars, this is the version to get."

Would love it if someone could seed for a bit. I'll keep seeding for a while after I'm done."
