,oragorn,2006-08-15T03:37Z,The listed cast is for Freedomland.
,Panodilo,2006-11-29T18:23Z,First actor billed is Brandon Largent. Who the fuck is  that? Just because a friend owns a nice camera doesn't give him the right to act.
,IdiocyFTW,2007-01-08T00:02Z,Wowww....Now that was horribly bad. Almost stopped watching after half-an-hour. Hahahaha...

,Philcore_The_Loud,2007-09-29T10:49Z,"Whoa Axxo, sorry, but every once in a while you come up with some REALLY shitty movie lol. This one was about as bad as it gets. At least I believe so, I stopped watching after the first two minutes... No Sam Jackson either. I fast forwarded through the rest of it and it just got worse. The zombies are just people with bad make-up. And there's like no music when the plot gets ""exciting""... This is a true horror movie... horrible acting, horrible effects, horrible score and the lamest script in hirstory Thanks for all the good ul tho. Keep it up - but not this shit :D"
