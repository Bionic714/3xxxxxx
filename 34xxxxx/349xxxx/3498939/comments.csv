,Agon024,2006-10-05T18:55Z,Please keep seeding. Is this the North America? I really need this.
,blio,2006-11-16T11:12Z,"The North America version of MapPoint 2006 freaks out on the setup unless the setup volume name is GEO13NA.  I burned it in ISO mode, I'm not sure if UDF mode will have different results.
