,jerbe,2006-06-21T20:11Z,"I think if you enable superseed-mode in your client, you will be able to seed all of the torrents at once. That way your client decides which part you send and to whom, which will use your bandwidth far more efficient. Basically your client will try to send different parts to all peers (then the peers can copy the parts between themselves and not wasting your bandwidth).
Superseed is useful when you are the only seed, and there are lots and lots of peers..."
