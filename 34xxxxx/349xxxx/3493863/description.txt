Bottom Live - DVDISO - All 5 Live Shows!
Including a DVD-menu; only one audio track (English 2.0) and no subs.

Bottom was a British sitcom of the early 1990s (and later a series of stage shows) written by Rik Mayall and Adrian Edmondson. They were also the main stars, respectively playing Richard Richard (Richie) and Edward Elizabeth Hitler (Eddie), who share a flat in Hammersmith, West London.

Five live theatre shows have been spun off over the years, and have been extremely popular as the two performers often (apparently) forget their lines and have to ad lib. They also often make fun of the town/city in which they are playing by making the locals out to be stupid. These productions are far cruder than the television incarnation, and feature new elements such as Richie's latent homosexuality and desire to shag Eddie. Invariably, a member of the audience will shout out the phrase "Have a wank!".

Of the five shows, the first, The Stage Show, set entirely in Richie and Eddie's Hammersmith flat, is widely considered to be the best. Particularly striking is Mayall's lunatic comic energy ? which is at its most intense ? in the video of the show at the Mayflower Theatre in Southampton.

All five Live Shows of the fabulous duo on one DVD. I think I've got this one of ED2K so release info isn't around. Can't find any covers on Amazon but there is a copyright notice and Universal intro on the DVD so it is a official DVD; quality of the DVD5ISO suggests the official to be DVD9. Owh well, bugger that, it's a nice DVD.

Enjoy & have a wank!
