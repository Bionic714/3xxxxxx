,ancientone,2006-06-10T04:50Z,"Anyone that wants to know where Guest House Paradiso fits in, according to someone close to Mayall, it is after Bottom - Hooligans Island where Eddie gets new ID's so they can stay hidden after finding they are still wanted over events in Live 2.

There is also a fourth series written but according to Mayall again ""Some stupid lesbian bitch keeps blocking it at the BBC..."" which probably did a lot for BBC relations with the writers ;)

So you wanna see more of Richie and Eddie, make the BBC's life hell..."
