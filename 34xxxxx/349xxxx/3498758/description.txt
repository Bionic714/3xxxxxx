Oh and there is no "Winamp Pro" crap in here.
My cd ripper is CDEX and my music burning software is CyberLink Power2Go.
The whole point of winamp is to be small, powerful and not bloated.
We don't need the, Cd Ripping, Audio converter, CD Burning, Music Buying, Video Player, Audio player and OS in one bloated to hell and back crap.




There is far to many skins to list here.
The Default skin directory is:
C:\Program Files\Winamp\Skins
I would not recomend in stall all of these at once.
It would most likely slow your player way down...
And if I wanted a slow bloated media player I would be useing Windows Media Player.


Please Seed for a darn long time and get all of your buddies in here.

I know winamp is going down ( thanks AOL! You couldn't stop with gaying up ICQ? ), but nothing has rised up to take it's place. So untell then winamp still whips the Mother Fucking Lama's Ass.
