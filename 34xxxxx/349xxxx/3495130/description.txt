This continues the weekly serial of Star Trek Original Series.
Every week until they are all done, I will seed another 2 episodes and the next weeks trailers. It should be fun.
I am shooting for fridays so you can seed all week.
welcome and happy seeding.

Sorry, Meant to include Ep1 last week, but screwed up. Further, 'The Unseen Pilot, with intro by G. Roddenberry will be included in the last group of this, the 2nd season.

This weeks episodes: The first hint of a Borg. Does anyone know where on 'Earth' that the initial beam down is? That is one pretty planet!  Also included is episode #1 as it aired. At the end of next season, there is the un-aired version with commentary by G. Roddenberry
