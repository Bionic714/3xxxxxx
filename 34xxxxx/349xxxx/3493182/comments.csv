,herbert talabis,2006-07-11T13:06Z,"I like SP3 from AMIT_TALKIN better. I could terminate programs instantly when it freezes while this one have to wait for like 10-20 seconds just like my previous SP2. And thought the boot screen sucks from AMIT_TALKIN (car), this one could not stretch evenly on my desktop resolution.

And the vista themes are optional. You have to install it manually and sometimes you might screw it up (mostly freeware btw). "

,k9182000,2006-07-15T21:40Z,Is this the new build of windows that will format a SATA drive at the right setting to stop data corruption after 1 week or 2? I have a copy of windows sp1 and if I format with that after 1 week it corrupts my data? (large SATA drives you gotta love them). SO is this the new copy that format at SP2 HDD support? 
,utsavhanda,2006-07-16T04:31Z,"Hi,
well this is the XP SP2 Build with hotfixes & updates of future official XP SP3, so you may download this. Also, i had not encountered any problems regarding sata data corruption with this build.

,k9182000,2006-07-16T09:44Z,Thanx utsavhanda when install this windows on you HDD did you need to use you SATA driver or does this windows have one? The new copy of win dows have the SATA driver in them.

,k9182000,2006-07-16T13:38Z,The Reasond I asked is because I have a MSI motherboard here. If I install windows with the floppy disk that comes with the Motherboard after around 1 week windows crashes and won't start in normal mode or safe mode? If I use a new windows CD and it installs with the new windows sata driver for my Motherboard then it will not corrupt my data and keep windows running. (for a while lol)

after extracting, which of the files should i burn to a CD (if i want to install directly from a CD)?"
,utsavhanda,2006-07-16T18:22Z,"hi,
just use any burning software like ""CDBurner Xp Pro"" or ""nero"" to burn .ISO file to any blank CD. burning .ISO file to Cd will give you the XP Installation CD.

,Cr0nan,2006-07-18T00:48Z,"Ok, thx for answere...

Still: i don't understand which of all the files i should burn to my CD. 
Should i burn the whole WinRar to a CD before extracting or just a specific file(s)?

Regards."
,utsavhanda,2006-07-18T04:19Z,"hi, 

ok fine ...mayy b i got ur prob...well u have winrar installed and .ISO file is opening in winrar when u dbl clik on it.

Well, u have to burn that .ISO file or dat winrar file  to the Cd, as it is the Installation disc image.

Thanks."
,CapnKaos,2006-09-29T22:54Z,"Don't download this. It screws up Power management (for UPS systems) and if the install ever breaks, there is no way to run a repair install. any WinXP CD will say that the partition it is on is not a valid NTFS Partition. Don't make my mistake."

There is just no way around it it seems, fucking windows.. I don't know how you willingly own a Computer with this SHIT on it.?

Extract .ISO or Copy CD Contents to a folder on hard disk and then run uwin installer, then you will not get uwi2.5cdfil error

Any Ideas?
,Scabass,2006-12-02T16:42Z,"I have been using this version for about three months now,with no problems what so ever..Many thanks to the uploader and the creator of this rip.

To the person who asked about M$ verifying if this is real..They will try to check,just do not update anything,or at least make sure you dont download/install/run the M$ verify tool.

So disable your auto updates and then make sure you disable 'how security center notifies me' to turn off the very annoying exclamation point and the popups you can get.

This is very easy to do,I dont feel like writing much more,so google is your friend."

Undrar om ni kan hjälpa mig med en sak eller rekommendera någon eller något angående UWI disk. Jag är ute efter någon som kan hjälpa mig att fixa en alldeles egen och skräddarsydd UWI disk just för mitt behov. Det ska bara vara program ej Windows Xp eller något operativsystem på den, jag skulle tro att det blir en DVD 4,7 eller 8,4 Gb. Det ska vara också en valmeny som det är på dom som man bara kryssar för och så installerar det sig automatiskt cracat och klart eller serienummer och klart det som man vill ha installerat.

Är det svårt att fix sånt här skälv?
