,MrEarp,2006-06-16T21:44Z,"Why Subs in Chinese, Korean, Thai ? 
The Pirate Bay is a SWEDISH SITE and TRACKER"
,Bedรถmaren,2006-06-16T22:19Z,"@ MrEarp: Maybe Swedish is inferior to all those  languages when it comes to lingustic qualities and articulation. But how would you know...
MrEarp is 9 years old and feels he kneeds to connect somebody elses work to his native tounge. Fool"

,Bahash,2009-01-28T17:46Z,"To MrEarp, where a site is hosted really means nothing in the Internet age. People from all over the world use this site. I myself do not reside in Sweden nor do I speak Swedish. The subs and dubs are there for anyone who might need them. Your views are actually very western-centric and just go to show the bias people hold."
,cassidino,2009-04-08T11:26Z,I appreciate the seeding of this movie. Was just wondering why the file is so large as it is 3-6 times larger than most other movies. Could someone comment on the quality as well please.
,patsone,2009-04-21T04:39Z,I would dearly like to download this video - I saw the orginal film back  in the 80's and loved it.  Windows Media will not accept format - any ideas please?
,Maharaja-Krishna,2009-06-12T03:32Z,"Well really a great movie I am seeding back anyway BUT there is ** NO FRENCH and NO SPANISH AUDIO ** track left !!! (It appears in the DVD menu but it has been cut.)
It's nice to share but not so nice to be misslead like that since I would not have downloaded the 4.35 GB if I would have known it...  :-((
The mentioned subtitles are all included though.
@ patsone: Just get the VLC media player (here or directly from the website) which is free to watch the movie.
OM Shanti"
