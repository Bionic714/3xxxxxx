
windows xp pro greek sp1 optimized (nLite-d)
**********************************************************
For me sp1 is better , when you want to surf in internet and faster for downloads.
There are many programms that you can use for anti-virus and anti-spy.
Sp1 includes microsoft virtual machine for java with lifetime updates, which is lighter than java sun.
(after SP1 microsoft did not include Java)

In this version of win xp pro greek enLite-d I did NOT include:
1. windows media player (you can use vlc media player (for avi files) and media player classic (for video files) instead, and foobar2000 (for audio files))
2. windows messenger
3. windows tour
4. remote registry change
5. remote desktop (and telnet.exe)
It will not ask you for serial during installation.
Everything else is included , and all language support as well.
It is tested and works fine.
I hope it will be a good download for Greek speaking friends who have an older pc and want to use it for internet or other applications. The old pc will work Fast, even if it is Pentium 3.

BURN the .iso file to a cd using your burning software and make a clear installation (format) on a new partition.

Waiting for your thoughts
