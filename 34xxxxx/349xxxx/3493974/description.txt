Trivia:
Roky (pronounce rock-eeh) Erickson was founding member and lead singer of psychedelic band, Texas? infamous Thirteenth Floor Elevators. Erickson explored the far reaches of musical and personal extremes. Young musicians like Jerry Garcia, Grace Slick, and Janis Joplin jammed with the influential group. Following a nightmarish '70s mental-hospital stint that had a devastating long-term effect on his mental health, Erickson's subsequent solo work with his group The Aliens revealed a singularly brilliant songwriter and performer whose talent was no less impressive for the fact that he was singing about zombies, vampires and aliens. The demons that abound in Roky's songs are all-too-real reflections of his own troubled psyche, and the combination of the artist's oddly poetic lyrical constructions and his bracing banshee wail makes it clear, as it wasn't always, that he's not kidding! Don?t Slander Me and Gremlins Have Pictures (collection of live and alternative versions), recorded 1975 -1982, document Roky?s genius. Roky Erickson cover versions have been made by R.E.M., ZZ Top, Primal Scream, Butthole Surfers, Julian Cope, The Jesus and Mary Chain and many more. Check out the "Where the Pyramide Meets the Eye - A Tribute to Roky Erickson" for a compilation of some of them.
