,warpigx,2006-06-13T11:58Z,PLEASE Please please put all the previous episodes into one folder named 'STOSS1.episodes'  and THEN download. You will help seed and also not fill your HD getting stuff you already have.
,warpigx,2006-06-25T18:53Z,"let me be absolutely clear. If you are missing any episodes from the weekly seed, if you do not seed the others while you seek the ones you lack, I will ban you from my swarm. The decent way to get a missing episode and not get banned, is to seed all the others while you get the one(s) you lack. Yes I am militant when it comes to seeding. It is only fair to the entire community that you seed what you have while you get what you want."
,herbman53,2006-07-15T07:24Z,Any plans to have the other seasons uploaded?
,headmonkey,2006-09-16T11:00Z,Just to let you know that I'll shall be seeding these and other STOS Torrents in-definitely.  As long as I can get them then they will always be seeded.
,7667565,2009-05-28T18:31Z,"I've nearly finished downloading this; a big thank you to warpigx for uploading this, and everyone else for seeding it.  I also intend to seed eternally.

I always thought TNG, DS9 and Voyager were the best Star Trek as I grew up with them... I was wrong.  

Yeah the special effects are cheesey; but it's charming rather than upsetting.  The stories here are compelling and original and the characters likeable and driven.  And there's genuine humour here too -  I don't recall much of that in the spin offs, particularly the execrable Enterprise.

In short, this is amazing and I'll be buying it as soon as I get the readies together :-)"
