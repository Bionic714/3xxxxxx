COMPRESSION: DVDRemake

IMPORTANT NOTE: I tried to delete all the extra features and compress to DVD5 with DVDRebuilder: 

- Reduction Level for DVD-5: 54,2%
- Overall Bitrate : 2.935Kbs
- Space for Video : 3.376.318KB

But, as you can see, the compression is very heavy (only the movie size is more than 7 Gb).

Err... There was a problem with the torrent uploaded 1hour ago, so this is the new and correct torrent.

It's a DVD9 ;)

Enjoy & share!!!
