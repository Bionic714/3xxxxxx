,roHar2o,2008-12-16T17:40Z,"I am sure that if we could get a good seed for about eight hours, we could all finish our downloads and take over from there. I have all of Season One and ~ 30-43% of Season Two and the Christmas Specials completed (though it took four weeks to get there). It would be The Perfect Holiday Gift if we could stuff everyone's stockings by the Xmas. 

Please seed. Thanks ! -roHar2O "
