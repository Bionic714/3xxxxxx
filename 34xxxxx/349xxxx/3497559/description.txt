This is a dance show hosted by James Brown that looks a lot like Soul Train.  It is mostly dancing with a couple of lip sync performances.  It was recorded at WTCG in Atlanta.  These took place around the time of James? ?Body Heat? album as that is what he plugs in each episode.  The title of the second show is taken from the first words James speaks in the show, as this episode does not have an information slide like the first one.  This is more of a period piece relic than a James Brown collectable as James doesn?t do much more than introduce dance numbers and the performers.  He only ?sings? for about 5 minutes total in both shows.  Each show has a black history moment included.  Finally, I?m not saying James partook in any drugs, but the look on his face on the shows tells me he was having a good time.  This is a must if you have any interest in a funky 70?s time capsule.  Good Gawd!
