JUNIP is the new band of JOSÉ GONZÁLEZ and
"Black Refuge" is the first 5-tracked EP,
acting taster to JUNIP's forthcoming album,
ready to pierce your heart with it's
immediate genuine honesty and intimate
folky pop. As is the case with González
distinctive solo songwriting, the trio
JUNIP could be said to belong to "the quiet
is the new loud" school, similar in vein to
fine folks like Elliott Smith, Kings of
Convenience and Hayden. The intimacy is all
present, and it feels so close, like Junip
sits in the very same room as you do,
singing, with mellow vocals reminiscent of
Mark Kozelek in Red House Painters,
accompanied by gently plucked and strummed
acoustic guitars.

here's the cd-release, with better quality
than the vinyl one. enjoy!
