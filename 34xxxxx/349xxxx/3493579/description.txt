Duration: 01:02:07

[Summary]

A short movie on how to start living a successful live
(and why the others can\'t do this).

Far too many people have no idea of what they can do because all they have 
been told is what they can?t do. They don?t know what they want because 
they don?t know what?s available to them.

\"...Right after you are born, you have the same chances to succeed, create and achieve as everybody. 

But right after that moment you face probably the worst enemy in your whole life. This enemy is called ?social pre-conditioning?
You are programmed since your birth and on with external values, beliefs and expectations 
by your parents, by the mass media, by your friends, by your school teachers and by other people you get in contact with.

These expectations, beliefs and values determine your character, your action and your entire future.\"

Do you want to live the life of your dreams?
Your time is limited, so don\'t waste it living someone else\'s life.
