,holyaco,2006-06-23T03:02Z,the game is kinda boring. it doesnt let you add new boats and its lacking on realism. it only gives you 3 controls on large ships and 2 controls on small boats. no waves. the graphics is kinda nice specially on waters. needs some improvement on ships specially on titanic. it uncolored parts like the cable infront of the ship. dumb AI's always go straight even if theres someone infront of them.
