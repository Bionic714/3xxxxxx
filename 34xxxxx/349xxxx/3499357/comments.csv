,Logarythmic,2006-06-29T11:39Z,This should be fun.
,AtLargeDude,2006-06-30T02:26Z,How... do we record this?
,ntrance2k,2006-07-02T10:51Z,well i supose as its a HDTV movie you will need a HD dvd burner to record it. 
,dannymc,2006-07-02T13:47Z,"you can split the file and burn to DVD, and play it back on a good PC, DVD players wont play them though, DVD is also a storage medium for data as well as DVD movies, V in DVD is versatile not video, hope this helps"
,00Bengtsson,2006-07-21T20:40Z,wow thanks!
,00Bengtsson,2006-07-21T20:43Z,seed please!
,Kukelikki,2006-09-03T19:18Z,how is the quality compared to the normal DVD version?
,Wintermute.se,2006-09-15T20:11Z,".TS-file

Video: MPEG2 Video 1920x1088 (16:9) 29.97fps 14250Kbps [Video]
Audio: Dolby AC3 48000Hz 6ch 384Kbps [Audio]
Subtitle: DVD Subpicture [Subtitle]

(1080i -> 1088 = the 8 last lines are grey)

The source is said to be 1080i... compared to a DVD which is normally 576p (or less). I use Media Player Classic and pan & scan to fill my screen (1680x1050 16:10 wide). 

It looks twice as good as the DVD so I guess it's correct. In my opinion worth downloading...

Thanx for the upload!"
,knaak,2006-09-16T11:43Z,The sound goes out of sync about 12 minutes into the movie.

,SicKn3sS,2006-09-30T16:18Z,"knaak, im pretty sure its just because your computer is slow."
,izardism,2006-10-11T05:03Z,"I just watched it...comes in 3 parts. Looks incredible! You don't have to have pci express to watch it. However, a faster agp 8x is certainly recommended. If nvidia and ati have you thinking you MUST have the latest and greatest, think again. Thanks for posting such an incredible version of one of the greatest movies ever made!!"
,nejbo1,2006-11-26T16:42Z,det laggar ju pung när jag spelar den här filmen? varför?
,Pablo_Pirate,2006-12-13T10:00Z,"i already downloaded the file but i do not know how to open it. i tried opening with winrar but then i don't know what to do...
does anybody knows what to do ?"
,Pablo_Pirate,2006-12-13T11:07Z,"nevermind guys... all i had to do was download ""hdtvpump"" and it plays on media center or windows media player. it looks fantastic on either one i had a 1.564 upload ratio
this torrent is worth downloading but more than anything is worth uploading.
thanx everybody"
[V],fokher,2006-12-25T14:44Z,"Yeah, as izardism stated; you do not need the lastes and greatest, at least not in video hardware, as my macbook can play it flawlessly, and it has ha built in Intel GMA 950 graphics accelerator.  "
,gamermaimer,2007-01-05T09:45Z,"Beautiful picture quality.
Plays well on Windows Media Player 9 or Power DVD 7.
And is really 1920x1080 not 1440x1080.
Truly worth downloading. But keep seeding. "
,KoroshiyaLevis,2007-01-19T12:54Z,How the fuck do I mount the .TS file??? :/
,Twin_tip,2007-01-20T10:27Z,Cant I see the movie on my HD-ready television !? Please answer
,bompo11,2007-01-24T23:45Z,if you have a good graphic-card and a dvi or hdmi connection between you computer and you tv. you can also burn it into a hd-dvd-r and watch it on a hd-dvd player..
,POPEYElfc,2007-01-29T01:25Z,"took me 4 days to download, worth the wait.
