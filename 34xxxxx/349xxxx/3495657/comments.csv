,albatorsk,2006-06-17T01:47Z,Anamorphic widescreen? Fullscreen? Letterbox?
,B-manSwe,2006-06-18T02:59Z,"Men fcuck kan inte nån göra denna till en äkta region 1 eller göra den regionsfri och sen lägga upp den igen, har laddat ner denna flera gånger och försökt att både patcha den med deras officiella region-fix och försökt göra om den till regionsfri osv i dvd-shrink mm men inget funkar, den nyper min dvd-spelare totalt när man klickar på play movie i menyn...hörde att "
,B-manSwe,2006-06-18T02:59Z,"Del 2:
det är för att denna relese är nukad för att den varken är region 1 (USA) eller Region 2 (Europa) utan nånstans mittemellan, går bra att spela på region 1 dvd-spelare eller moddade dvd-spelare som inte är sk regionsfria...suck..."
,MasterVadim,2006-06-20T20:25Z,Anyone else getting a corrupt file?
,z0diac,2006-06-21T01:32Z,"this shit fails to burn for me, files corrupt or incomplete.. don't bother downloading.."
,EMUzing,2006-06-22T05:31Z,MPAA Is all over this 1  Whatch your self north america!!!
,popnfresh,2006-06-23T18:40Z,"I don't know what people are complaining about. The download went fine for me. The movie is complete, it burned to disk as expected and it looks and sounds great. This is the best V for V torrent currently available. These other posters must work for the MPAA or else they just don't know jack about burning VIDEO_TS folders properly."
,Mickeloo,2006-06-23T18:53Z,Vob 5 file doesnt work. Have downloaded it twice! And i have burned loads of movies like this!
,popnfresh,2006-06-24T01:07Z,VOB 5 works perfectly for me and I only downloaded it once. It's the last few minutes of the film and the credits. No problems at all. But frankly I'm surprised that my copy works. Posting a 4.3GB naked VIDEO_TS folder online invites file corruption. It's also possible someone (eg: the MPAA) was able to inject bogus packets into the torrent stream. It only takes one bad packet among 4.3 gigs of data to fuck up the whole thing. I think I just got lucky.
,lefou,2006-06-29T11:47Z,"Hello, guys!

I just downloaded this DVD release of V for Vendetta.

I was able to play it on my PC using Windows Media Player without a problem.

I also have burned it on a single DVD disk using Nero Burning Rom (7.0).

All is OK:) So you may safely download this release, watch it on your PC or burn it to DVD without a problem:)

There are no corrupt files on the disk!

Would be also nice if someone would post here somewhere the uncompressed version of this DVD :-)"
,e2tango,2006-07-03T19:45Z,"download was corrupt for me as well :(
Going to try and download again"
,bmz,2006-07-07T21:55Z,"Mine was corrupt.  I could watch it on my PC but it fails to burn.  Still, a great film.  I hadn't seen it before but now I am going to buy it so this torrent served its purpose for me, I suppose."
