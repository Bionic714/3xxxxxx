,jÃ¶nte,2007-10-29T17:03Z,how hard can it be to seed a torrent you have uploaded!?
,chdnolimits,2008-08-02T23:24Z,TO SHUNT AND GRAVE DIGGER: THE REASON IT STINKS IS BECAUSE YOU ARE PLAYING THE STOCK VERSION WHEN MODDED THE GAME IS JUST AS GOOD AS ROBOTWARS EXTREME DISTRUCTION IN FACT I MAY UPLOAD  A MOD BUT U TORREENT IS BEING A P.I.T.A (PAINN IN THE YOU KNOW WHAT) AND YES I TAKE AN INSULT TO THIS GAME AS AN INSULT TO MYSELF
,mattymerr,2009-07-19T11:08Z,if it says unknown format your probably using power iso instead use daemon

,Oceano798,2011-11-20T04:09Z,Okay this is bugging me. I have been looking for the first one and still can't find it. PLEASE PUT A TORRENT UP OF THE FIRST ONE. PLEASE!!!!!
,RAJKE,2011-11-30T14:08Z,"this is a great game, i installed it , it works on windows 7 x64 like a charm...

HOW TO PLAY ONLINE:
1) download this patch:  http://www.robotarena.com/files/RA2_Patch_V13.exe

it doesn't needs any crack...

2) download  install create account and login to gameranger...

3) host the game and enjoy.



BTW @____shunt____ you are very wrong.. this game is far better then robot wars extreme destruction game... This is better because you can define and customize and design everything from engines, to wheels placements and everything like you build in real life robot... and that game that you mention... has predefined presets, and customization is just terrible.... thats my opinion THIS GAME IS AWESOME AND SEED IT PEOPLE PLEASE SO MORE PEOPLE CAN ENJOY IT ... MY GAMERANGER ACCOUNT IS rajke88 you can add me to friend list there, maybe ill meet you guys in the arena :) .. have a nice day to all!!
