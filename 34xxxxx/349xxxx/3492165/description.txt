What is this clip?
It's the full compilation of the security-tapes from when the police raided PRQ in search for The PirateBay.

It's edited to be somewhat time synced so that we can follow the movements of the officers from different angles. It's not perfect, but it's the overall picture that is important.

Please notice:
They cover the cameras with plastic bags and take pictures when the area is security classed as a proteced area (swe: 'Skyddsobjekt'). Isn't this a violation?
