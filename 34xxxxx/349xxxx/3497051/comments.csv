,manchy88,2006-06-21T17:25Z,is your upload fast enough so that you will be able to seed al this Elvis movies at once?
,Miguel28,2006-06-21T18:33Z,"No it isn't, but i didn't expect so many downloads at once... i will upload one at time and pause the others"
,percy1,2006-06-21T22:08Z,"Thx, very much!"

,Leton,2006-06-25T23:22Z,"seeda, please"
,stuffer,2006-06-26T13:17Z,would be nice if someone bothers to seed!
,Miguel28,2006-06-26T14:36Z,"This torrent is paused while i'm seeding another Elvis movie, i have to seed one at time, otherwise would take much long"
,sarge1,2006-07-07T21:38Z,I think it is time to seed this
,Miguel28,2006-07-08T03:03Z,"I'm sorry all for the time of waiting, i'm a newbie in this things
Next torrent will have 4 DVD Elvis movies, it should be easier"
,Leton,2006-07-08T09:33Z,väldigt drygt att vänta. verkar inte släppa på pausknappen. Detsamma gäller Blue hawaii. finns det någon annan än miguel28 som har dessa filmer och kan lägga ut och seeda dem?
,sleepyman2,2006-07-08T19:23Z,"Thanks Miguel28, I'm looking forward to get this Elvis movie, hope you will start upload this now. A good advice, do not opload the next movie before you have uploadet 1-2 day or more than 60%, dependent of your upload speed. Thanks"
,sleepyman2,2006-07-11T22:54Z,"Has Elvis left the torrent, forever this this time ?"
,cmoodyuk,2006-07-16T21:47Z,seeders needed
