I just wonder if it's HDtv quality, because when i wanted to re-author with dvd-shrink the main movie was 6.734 MB without compression.
If it's HDtv quality i will keep the main movie."

LISTEN UP.  YOU'RE ABOUT TO LEARN SOMETHING.

This is Eyes Wide Shut PAL Full Screen version and it is the
BEST VERSION EVER RELEASED ON DVD.

HERE'S WHY:

Movie film is shaped like a full screen TV and has been since
the beginning.  Movies used to be shaped like that - The Wizard
of Oz, Gone With The Wind, and so on - and that's why TVs were
made that way.

When the movies went to widescreen all they did was black out
the top and bottom of the full screen film, leaving a widescreen
picture across the middle.  This was displayed on the new wide
theater screens just fine, but when it came to home video, there
were black bands at the top and bottom of a full screen TV.
Most people were too lazy to learn why (probably those who quit
reading before they got this far), or too stupid to understand
(probably those who will quit reading before they get to the
image link below that makes the point), so all they did was
bitch until the people selling the movies chopped off the sides
of the widescreen picture to make it fit a full screen TV.

Imagine one side of a Rubik's Cube being the actual film in the
movie camera.  Now black out the top row of cubes and the bottom
row of cubes, and look at the three colored cubes across the
middle.  That's your average widescreen movie.  Now black out
the one color cube remaining on the left side, and the one color
cube remaining on the right side, and look at the single color
cube remaining in the center.  That's your average widescreen
movie that has been chopped down to fit a full screen TV set.

The above example is not to scale but it does make the point
that often, we're seeing only a tiny patch of the original film
that was shot.  It's pathetic.

Stanley Kubrick shot his last few movies in full screen, using
all of the area of the actual frame of movie film... FULL
SCREEN.  Then they were matted for widescreen theater release,
meaning the top and botton were blacked out.  His stated wishes
were that when these movies came around to home video release,
the mattes would be removed and the original full screen
picture would be shown.

You can Google these points and find a thousand pages of proof,
but all you really need to stay with me for now is to look at
these two actual screen captures that I took from the full
screen version in this torrent, and the ""deluxe widescreen""
version I bought off ebay.  Look:

Are you a believer yet?

Ok, ok.  Sorry for being so arrogant.  I'm really not such an
asshole.  I'm just sick and tired of morons ranting about shit
they know nothing about.  Example:  A couple years ago there was
a guy on Amazon bitching and complaining that the Kung Fu Season
2 DVD set wasn't widescreen like season 1 was.  Now you see this
coming, right?... The Kung Fu Season 1 box set had cropped the
top and bottom off of the old original full screen TV image to
make it widescreen for shit eating fucktard morons exactly like
the guy I just mentioned.  Caine would throw a kick and you
wouldn't see his foot until it got as high as his belt.  The top
of his hat was always cropped off.  Total and complete SHIT and
here's some dingleberry whining that they didn't butcher season
2 the same way.  But I digress.

Back to Eyes Wide Shut:  Another way you see more picture with
this version is that they don't mask off the fucking scenes
during the mansion orgy.  In the American version they told
Kubrick he had to cut or reshoot those scenes to avoid an X
rating but he refused, so the censors placed black silhouettes
in front of our field of view, as though there were people
standing in front of us, blocking our view of the fucking.

But wait!  The new ""Deluxe 2 disk set"" doesn't have those people
blocking our view!  We can see the fucking now! ... in matted
widescreen, with a good deal of the picture missing, including
the girl's pussy, as in the example above.

Yes, it's true:  THIS TORRENT IS THE BEST VERSION OF EYES WIDE
SHUT EVER RELEASED ON DVD.  I haven't looked at the Blu-Ray
version but I'll bet it's 1)"
,x30001wtm,2012-01-25T07:22Z,"Whoa!  First time I ever exceeded the text limit.  Allow me to conclude:

Yes, it's true:  THIS TORRENT IS THE BEST VERSION OF EYES WIDE
SHUT EVER RELEASED ON DVD.  I haven't looked at the Blu-Ray
version but I'll bet it's 1) widescreen and therefore 2) shit
and 3) against Kubrick's wishes not to mention 4) our right to
look at pussy.

Discuss.
