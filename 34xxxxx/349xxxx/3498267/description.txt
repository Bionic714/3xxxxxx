Justice is under threat in the Big Meg. The Frendz crime syndicate has
a new leader, the Boss, who is openly defying the Law. Worse still,
a fatal disease is driving Judges insane, turning them into psychotic
killers. 

After a lifetime's training, Rookie Amy Steel is being assessed by
Joe Dredd to see if she is ready to become a Judge. When Dredd begins
acting strangely, Steel can't believe he has the deadly disease. 

But when the legendary lawman attacks her, Steel has to report him.

Judge Dredd is wanted - dead or alive!

This story takes place in April 2124.
