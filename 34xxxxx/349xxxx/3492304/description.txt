NEW FEATURES

This version of VirusScan Enterprise provides
several new features that help to prevent and more
effectively detect intrusions:

-   Product Version Number

    The new version is 8.0i.

    The product version number has changed from 7.1
    to 8.0 to reflect the major changes within the
    product since the last release. See the
    following "New Features" and "Changed Features"
    for more information.

    The "i" has been added to represent that McAfee
    VirusScan Enterprise is the first anti-virus
    product in the world that contains proactive
    Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) protection
    capabilities. These IPS capabilities are
    provided in the Buffer Overflow Protection
    feature which comes from McAfee Entercept, our
    host intrusion prevention security product.

-   Access Protection.

    Use this feature to prevent intrusions by
    restricting access to ports, files, shares, and
    folders.

    You can block ports by creating rules to specify
    which ports to block and whether to restrict
    access to inbound or outbound processes. You can
    also exclude processes from the rule if you want
    a specific process, or list of processes, to be
    allowed access to the otherwise blocked port.
    When you block a port, both TCP and UDP accesses
    are blocked.

    You can restrict access to shares by making them
    read-only or blocking read and write access to
    all shares.

    You can block files and folders by creating
    rules that specify which processes to block from
    the files or folders you define, which file
    actions to prevent, and what action to take when
    an attempt is made to access a blocked item.

    These Access Protection features can be very
    effective in preventing intrusions. In the event
    of an outbreak, the administrator can block
    access to the infected areas until a DAT is
    released.

       NOTE:
       If you block a port that is used by the
       ePolicy Orchestrator agent or the Entercept
       agent, the agent's processes are trusted by
       the filter and are allowed to communicate
       with the blocked port. All other traffic not
       related to these agent processes will be
       blocked.

    This version of VirusScan Enterprise provides
    some sample port blocking rules and some sample
    file and folder blocking rules. With a default
    installation, some of these rules are in warning
    mode and others are in blocking mode.
Just install and UPDATE ... and use
                                    best regards  alexG
