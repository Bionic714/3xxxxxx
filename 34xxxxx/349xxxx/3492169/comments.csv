,The Living Homer,2007-12-28T08:02Z,"While I did download this and take a look at it (and highly appreciate the upload). I would not recommend the for dummies books. Take a look on amazon for the reviews. In the CSS Web Design for dummies, a review was written on amazon: (I just started reading this book and none of code so far is correct. I just found out that you need to put a semi colon after each declaration! That is a very important thing in CSS apparently and they don't even put it in the book? Then they misstype the code so it won't work? Very disappointed. After reading the rest of these reviews (which I should have done first) I doubt I will finish the book.) This is something very important. The for dummies books don't have a lot of great reviews by people because they don't tell you everything that you need to know. Granted some books may help you but to me, it's no longer worth it."

-- Hey ""Living Homer"", dont take any offence, pal. The dummies books are not meant/supposed to tell you everthing. Their very motto is to keep it simple for the freshers. Of course, if you found a mistake in them, it is really bad that they (j.willys) have let it creep through. I haven't come across anything wrong/faulty yet, thank god. I love them. 
Best of luck.
Keep seeding.

Loads of thankyous to Libera35 for this torrent."

,KanaraTannee,2010-01-09T05:37Z,"Yeh, the CSS for Dummies book is ridiculous. So far, and I'm a good chunk of the way into the book. Has been wrong.

For example, this line, taken from big chunk of other code that also had other mistakes.

img.relative {position: relative; left = 35%; top = 20%}

Should read

img.relative {position: relative; left:35%; top:20;}

So stupid.

The explanations are really good for stuff, and understanding CSS pretty well... But not having correct code is retarded. Although I feel that I'm learning better debugging their code every single tutorial."
