The Hitman series has been around for almost six years now, as they?ve followed the adventures of Agent 47, an uber-
professional cloned hitman that?s tasked with taking out the trash on behalf of the shadowy assassin?s guild known only as The 
Agency. His lifestyle has its ups and down, but in the end, he gets to kill people and hide their bodies for a living, which is 
good work if you can find it. 
Players familiar with the Hitman series will be right at home in Hitman: Blood Money, the latest installment in the series. In it, 
47 is up to his old games as he throttles numerous innocents simply because he wants to steal their clothes in order to infiltrate 
off-limits areas and inject poison into cakes which he then places in front of large men with sweet tooths who then lick the 
icing and keel over dead. All in a day?s work for 47, really. Of course, the game also allows you to be as ruthlessly violent as 
you want; if you want to take things subtle and slow, you?re going to be able to, but if you just want to kill everything that 
moves with an automatic rifle, then you?ll be allowed to do that as well. 
Of course, finding the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"proper\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" way to eliminate your foes in Hitman: Blood Money can be a process of trial and error...and 
error...and error. If you don?t fancy the prospect of reloading your savegames multiple times just to figure out the specific path 
that one of your targets takes through, then GameSpot?s Game Guide for Blood Money is here to help. In it, we?re going to 
give you specific tips to take on each of the game?s difficult missions, so enjoy.
