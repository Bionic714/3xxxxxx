,ThetaRepublic,2007-02-09T20:41Z,"Duh. This torrent is pointless. In fact, on Guildwars.com, they have the Guild wars client available for download. The only way you'd get to actually play guild wars is if you got a CD key. And that's most likely not going to happen, as keys are validated from GW servers."
,chrisse002,2007-02-21T18:59Z,PLEASE Can anyone find/uppload a working guildwars Keygen???
,master_lufkin,2007-02-24T15:29Z,"If you really won`t buy the game..and want to play follow these steps ...

1.go to wal-mart
2.pick up the game
3.open the package
4.take out the white slip of paper with the activation key
5.put paper in pocket
6.take package up to cashier and say
""maam I saw some kid opening this, but when he saw me watching he put it down.""
7.the cashier will thank you
8.go home  and download client
9.install client
10.enter key and play
11.and the only effect it has is that wal-mart`s share holders get $0.001 cent less on there dividend check."
,chrisse002,2007-02-26T18:40Z,I have allready tried that but the problem is that here in sweden all the gameshops dont have that cd.key in the games box. They have it in the storage in a vault :D
