Very good perfomance by our 14-year old superstar. She sings "Don't cry your heart out" which is her new single. Live from the Swedish TV-show "Bingolotto".
I'm sorry that the quality of this videos is not as high as my videos use to be. But my dvd-recorder fucked up during the recording so I had to use a vhs-backup that I made. But it's still Ok. Enjoy it my friends.
