You could try hitting F8 when booting and add -v to the boot prompt and see if you get some more information.

Secureable (free)
to test your hardware if it supports vizulisation (vt-x)

also great (free) software to check all your computer specs: its important that your system supports

,mmm.555,2012-04-19T00:20Z,"@daggard I have the exact same system, well more or less; my graphics card is an NVIDIA GeForce 9400GT.  I don't know about your graphics but I would try Snow Leopard 10.6.6 or 10.6.8 by Hazard - Lion won't work on Pentium 4, but SL is still very good; I'm very happy with mine - 10.6.6 with App Store - I can install most apps and games very few insist on a higher version.  Use nvinject for graphics and boot in 32 bit mode if it doesn't want to boot.  Probably GraphicsEnabler=yes will be sufficient for graphics - you may not need a kext, just boot with arch=i386 for 32bit mode if it doesn't boot normally.  VoodooHDA may work for sound otherwise google ALC880 snow leopard and install the kext. Oh the sound advice is for inbuilt audio; you can google your card name and osx and see what comes up otherwise use the built in and save the PCI for something else.

@george047 Your graphics card is suitable but Im not sure about AMD - try Hazard 10.6.2."
