Ripped with DVD Shrink 3.2 from an earlier dl.


""Lianna" might be a bit outdated, but John Sayles captured it very well. He captured a woman from Alberta, Canada going through a change in her life when she was in a unhappy marriage with two children. Lianna saw something in herself when she saw Ruth, the professor, in class. Though the relationship between the two women were not always wonderful and loving at times, they have had their moments. Lianna could always turn to her friend, a non lesbian, for comfort. The movie began in the playground just like it ended in the playground."

......."So my comment would be to warn you that there is a lot of mediocre acting and the photography was not great. I'm sure the budget of the movie had a lot to do with it. And in some way the lack of great lighting, etc., and the "lameness" of the movie tends to work in its favor to present the subject matter as very ordinary, very commonplace, in opposition to how society wants to view this as something very unusual."
