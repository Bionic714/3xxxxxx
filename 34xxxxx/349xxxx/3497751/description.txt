3 CD images .RARd 
just unrar and burn with Nero (or whatever)
Unfortunatly the metroguides are not routeable on the GPSr units, Only on the PC.
Address lookup does work on compatable GPS Units.


This is NOT the latest Metroguide Europe. I'm still looking for Garmin Metroguide Europe V8, and Metroguide North America v7 both don't need to be unlocked.
Found this one on the ever crappy and slow EMule network. If you have a later version of metroguide Europe or North America please share!!

UNLOCK CODES
Garmin City Navigator and City Select both need unlock codes. The Unlock codes are specific to the GPSr unit id and the software version. So the unlock code you see with the CS and CN torrents will only unlock the maps on your computer not on the GPSr, and isn't that the whole point of City Navigator and City Select?
