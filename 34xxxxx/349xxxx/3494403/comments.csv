[M],Q91,2006-06-11T12:18Z,well i have tried most the ones listed on Zophar and none seems to get the game working (most of them didnt even run at all)

Go to that URL for a copy of the emulator posted with the proper BIOS files included.

The BIOS files are required for the emulator to work.

You really should research things before you complain about them not working ;)"
