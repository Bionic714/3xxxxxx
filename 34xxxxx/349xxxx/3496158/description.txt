The jungle is a jinx for TARZ & JANE, CHEETA & BOY when the fearless but overweight King of the Jungle gets his manhood bitten off. Yup, after climbing down the aluminum ladder from his tree house and losing a wrestling match with Cheeta the Obnoxious Ape (played by a guy in one of the world?s worst gorilla suits), Tarz attacks a menacing croc who makes off with his member, Ouch!

Naturally, Jane is terribly upset. Especially since she?s horny as hell and isn?t satisfied with Boy, a dim-witted dork who stopped being a boy years ago: "Boy is fastest gun in the jungle!" So Boy suggests they visit the mysterious Wango-Wango tribe whose sexual magic might make Tarz a man again, Aided by Wanda, a Great White Huntress played by notorious adult-film star Georgina Spelvin, they venture to the land of the Wango-Wango to get Tarz a new tool in this outrageously dumb dirty-joke of a jungle film ....

Over in the next jungle. you?ll find TARZUN AND THE VALLEY OF LUST - a "Storefront-Theater" classic - in which a younger, more virile Jungle Man does battle with an even worse-looking man-in-monkey-suit before lowering the loin-cloth for both Jayne, his platinum-blonde squeeze, and Meena. a jungle goddess who succors Tarzun?s groin after the klutz swings smack into the trunk of a tree....
Obviously, Edgar Rice Burroughs these ain?t.
