,nanaem,2006-06-27T18:31Z,Alien vs Predator 2 + Primal Hunt ? säker på att det inte bara är expansionen du laddar upp? AvP 2 Primal Hunt Expansion.bin endast 344 mb?  
,krutan,2006-06-27T23:03Z,"Endast expansionen ""Primal Hunt"""
,koshman,2006-06-29T10:05Z,is this a rip?
,XoSkeLLeT,2006-07-18T23:31Z,ehmm... does this one work? downloaded several torrents... they are all f**ked up =(
,4l13n,2006-07-29T15:30Z,"Fungerar dessa filer som de ska? Jag har prövat med Daemon tools men det kommer bara upp en liten ful ruta som det står ""Wrong Cd Inserted"" på men detta händer bara när jag öppnar den så.k ""Cd 1"" annars händer ingenting! Hjälp! "
,4l13n,2006-07-29T15:50Z,"Jag har hört att man måste cracka spelet, men som jag skrev tidigare, jag kan inte ens installera det och jag tror knappast att man kan cracka en .iso fil."
,Ksino,2006-08-15T17:30Z,for future reference this is supost to be AvP 2 and the expansion for the PC and has nothing to do with AvP extinction for the XBox which is a RTS.
,Ksino,2006-08-15T17:31Z,Ill be posting again after im finished downloading to tell you if this is the game or not because that file size is suss.
,Ksino,2006-08-15T19:14Z,"OMFG BS 1337 HAX! ok this is ONLY THE EXPANSION! also, i had to use ISO Buster on it because its a .bin file but besides that its fine."

,JanneDaMan,2006-11-26T15:05Z,"Hey can someone help me with this simple problem. I dunno how to mount cd 1 or cd 2 with DAEMON TOOLS, because I cant find any images, when I try to mount it. 

Do I even have to mount anything because I can start setup without mounting anything. Theres problem with setup too. At 100 % it says that it cant load dll: dsetup, and terminates the setup. How anyone help me pls?"
,alpine_64,2006-12-15T22:22Z,Snälla kan inte nån seeda ligger på 99.4%
,nattblind,2007-04-05T20:00Z,"The reason why ye cant mount it is because the fool who uploaded this shit didnt incluide the .cue file, which is the actual image file that needs to be mounted..."
,Tissell,2007-05-10T18:35Z,He has only uploaded the expansion. you will need the original game to play this game.
,Persekarva,2007-06-14T05:32Z,"Actually the .cue file is not needed at all. You can manually open the .bin or .iso file with daemon tools. And the cue file is NOT the actual image file. Take a look at file sizes and you will see that the .bin/.iso file is several hundred mbs, while the .cue file is just a few kbs.

And people, read comments before you make comments. Alot of you are asking the same question over and over, when it has already been answered several times. lol."
,Tomhet,2007-08-26T18:59Z,Please seed it.
