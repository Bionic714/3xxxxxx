Files are kinda low in quality, but I don't mind that too much. It's all about the info!"
,EdHead,2007-12-11T20:46Z,"Spoke too soon! The second season is lower quality, but seasons 1 and 3 are just dandy!"
,meoon,2008-02-07T05:00Z,"is dandy good or bad? :P 
i am norwegian hehe:) "
,jcharliem,2008-03-31T11:14Z,dandy means a-ok
,vagabonding,2009-04-04T03:29Z,"I'm from Sri Lanka, what does ""a-ok"" mean?"
,Chjris,2009-05-21T22:01Z,"vagabonding, ""a-ok"" means ""safe as fuck, mate"".

But the thing is, it's not safe as fuck. A lot of the episodes are of very bad quality."

Now if I could just get past ""Locating Sources"", I find it funny that I'm sharing to 20+ people at up to 65 KB/s and I can't even get the early seasons of Bullshit to download at even 1 KB/s, hell, not even a fraction.
Can a brother get a quick pass for sharing 1400+ files?"
