,Schopenhauer,2006-06-07T23:40Z,"There IS no subs included in this torrent, so unless u speak japanese its not much of a point to watch.... I googled around for the KickAssAnime subs that are mentioned on this page but with no results at all. Anyone got a idea about what to do
? "
,sangraal,2006-06-08T11:48Z,"given that its an mkv file id say the subs are in the container use virtualdubmod to check the streams and demux the subs to a srt file if you have to
or maybe check your players settings to show subs"

,PhoenixRulz81,2008-08-13T00:36Z,Sound is a little off - Used Gom player and has subs but Background sounds are louder than speaking. 
,Haderust,2008-12-27T23:21Z,for those that are using VLC player got to right click (on view screen) and check subtitles THEN will you have subs
,RockQueenAlex,2009-06-06T22:21Z,"When youÂ´re using vlc just open the file and klick on audio and then subs.

But why can't i burn this file to a dvd-cd? :c"
