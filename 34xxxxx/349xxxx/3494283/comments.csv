,eastern876,2008-06-03T10:28Z,"If you are interested in this subject matter, you will definitely want to get the following torrent: 

In the 1980s, radio station KABC carried the ground-breaking radio program ""OPEN MIND"" with host Bill Jenkins.   The subject matter covered included UFOs, alternative energy, spirituality, ancient religions, and more.   Bill Jenkins later went on to host the classic film ""THE NAKED TRUTH"" with Jordan Maxwell, upon which the current internet hit ""ZEITGEIST"" is based.

The ""Open Mind"" radio programs have not been heard in many years ... until now.   We recently came into possession of a large collection of cassette tape recordings which had been made by a loyal listener, and had them digitized into MP3s.  This is a priceless collection of otherwise unattainable radio programs.   It is being freely shared here in an effort to make sure it is not lost to  history.

I'll also try to seed this movie for some time, people need to know about Tesla!"
,kfson,2008-12-02T23:40Z,"Anyone have a copy of ""Modern Marvels"" Mad Electricity? :Nikola Tesla's bizarre vision of the future brought him failure, but his genius electrified the world. Travel to Niagara Falls, where in 1893, Tesla installed his new system of Alternating Electrical Current known as AC--the same power we use today. Uncover the forgotten ruins of Tesla's dream experiment---a huge tower on Long Island Sound he hoped would wirelessly power the world. Radar, death rays, invisibility devices and earthquake machines: Tesla claimed to have created them all. More than 100 years ago Tesla foresaw the need for alternative energies like geothermal and solar. "

Could someone who has the DVD of this film please upload it (uncompressed)...?

This -- this torrent -- is the only copy of the film available (from what i've found) anywhere, and the quality sucks pretty much..

,nehoc,2009-02-21T00:37Z,"The film was shown on the Croatian TV few weeks ago - in this DIVX somebody cut off the first seven and half minutes before the opening titles!

Those 7 minutes are some kind of crazy documentary titled ""Tesla danas"" (Tesla Today) - first 2 minutes it shows New York, Tesla's hotel and his museum in Belgrade, with Croatian commentary, then there are interviews with two half-crazy inventors working in Tesla's trace, and then some crazy Cult is shown - the Church of Tesla. Before the title, some man is showing Tesla's energy lines on the globe... As weird it is, it adds to the weirdness of the film itself. It's not quite an realistic biopic, as Tesla is shown as mystic and man of vision."
,nehoc,2009-02-21T00:44Z,"@ {-Rise-of-the-Truth-}

This divx is obviously ripped from the usually low-quality Serbian DVD release - http://www.yu4you.com/items/sr/dvd/item_1.html

The copy shown at Croatian TV was new transfer from the original negative - Croatian Television is usually screening domestic movies from from its own new transfers done directly from the stocks of Croatian Cinematheque. The quality is always much better than DVD release."
,hippie_burnout,2009-07-16T01:50Z,"I am furious, furious on the USA. He was the greatest man who ever lived, today people are starting to understand his genius. He will forever live on, in Serbia, and in all of our hearts. I hope he'll get bigger, now that Tesla Motors are getting bigger aswell. TESLA FOREVER!"
,b5stdwjag,2010-01-28T16:55Z,"Hey hippie,
I guess you really are a burnout. Why would you be furious on the US?
A great many Americans are bringing this great mans discoveries back into the world. America was one of the first, if not the first to officially change the record to show that Mr. Tesla was the first to invent wireless communication, not Marconi. The American government is more than likely using his discoveries and methods to create fantastic craft that defy imagination. Craft that are flying all over the world and probably in space as well.
Nikola Tesla chose to come here and become an American citizen. He was fiercely patriotic and fully supported the US. If it were not for that scamming, lying ripoff Edison, Tesla would be the household name, credited with saving the world. His free energy methods would have saved the environment, made life so much easier on many, brought prosperity to now starving countries and maybe prevented many wars. He was short changed in many ways but it wasn't the US that did it."
