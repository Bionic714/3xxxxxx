I know MySQL is avaliable for download on the internet, I got it that way. So don't come shouting about that. 
However:
1) Bittorrent is a good cheap and effective way for distributing Open Source software. We don't use the bandwidth of the people that so kindly let us use their software for free when we download it through a torrent. 
2) We should not only use torrents and the Piratebay for pirate stuff. It is powerfull for all kind of data.
