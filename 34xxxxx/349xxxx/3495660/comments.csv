,pumpkin,2006-06-17T10:41Z,The quality of the rip is excellent! I prefer downloading 1-CD-rips to whole DVDs  - its faster & doesn't strain my bandwidth as much. I hope axxo and everyone else will continue to churn out high-quality-700-meg-releases like this one.

--------------------------------------------------------
now. just foget that everything in PC world is Plug & Play. sometimes you've to install or set up something.

START.

1 - Just forget about your Windows Media Player. it's crap. I've tested almost all kind of media players. one of them is reaaly good. and that is VLC media Player. VLC media player is a highly portable multimedia player for various audio and video formats (MPEG-1, MPEG-2, MPEG-4, DivX, mp3, ogg, ...) as well as DVDs, VCDs, and various streaming protocols.
You can DL it from here : (for Windows ) http://www.videolan.org/vlc/download-windows.html 
for other OP systems , please check the home site : http://www.videolan.org/vlc/


2 - you need some filters or codecs. these work like translator for your PC, Which sysytem shold play how!?
one of these are AC3 filter. it enable your system to play Dolby and DTS sound system.

DL AC3 Filter from here , then install it : 
http://ac3filter.net/index.php?name=Sections&req=viewarticle&artid=5

3 - one of the video formats is Xvid. XviD is an MPEG-4 compatible codec, which produces very good video quality -- something that really competes with DivX. 
DL from here, then install it : http://www.afterdawn.com/software/video_software/codecs_and_filters/xvid.cfm

4 - the most usual, powerful and popular format is Divx.
DL and install it from here : http://www.divx.com/

*** When you have all these codecs and filters, then it doesn't matter which Media player you use. these codecs will be in you PC forever.

that's all for today. any question?

( I'll send this to all aXXo releases )"

CharlotteKM, you are seriously one deluded dope. anyone who knows anything about anything knows that aXXo's username is 'axxo', not 'axxo-torrents'. seriously, how do you manage to walk around with your feet so firmly in your mouth?
truth be said, whoever downloaded this torrent thinking it really was aXXo and was disappointed can only blame himself/herself. the description page messed up, a different username.. hello, do you guys know how to read? sure, someone wants to take aXXo's name to get popularity - you guys should be smarter than to fall for the bait! probably can't even tie your own shoelaces..."

Xvid is a fully cross-compatible codec with a few quality advantages over DivX. they're not related except for name. "

,sothcott,2008-10-11T16:38Z,"@fuzkeren,

This is a political movie and it teaches people stuf and maybe wakes them up to what is happening in the world. I don't agree with the repulican v democrat bias of Ligars post. I think that mainstream politics has been corrupted so both left and right are bad. To be in the middle probably means you are a facist so that's bad too. This movie is not a clear cut V is the hero and authority is bad type of thing. 

The trigger event was the shooting of a little girl in a V mask by the police. I am not so sure in our real world version of V that even that would wake us up."

The Gunpowder Treason and Plot,
I can think of no reason
Why the Gunpowder Treason
Should ever be forgot.

Guy Fawkes, Guy Fawkes, t'was his intent
To blow up the King and Parli'ment.
Three-score barrels of powder below
To prove old England's overthrow;
By God's providence he was catch'd
With a dark lantern and burning match.

Holloa boys, holloa boys, let the bells ring.
Holloa boys, holloa boys, God save the King!"
