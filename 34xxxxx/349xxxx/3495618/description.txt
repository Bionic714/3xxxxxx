An all-star benefit show at London's Royal Albert Hall for the citizens of the Caribbean island of Montserrat, playground to the stars and home to the AIR Studios. But the tiny island suffered the onslaught of 1989's Hurricane Hugo and a subsequent battery of volcanic eruptions that brought massive destruction of property and loss of life. Phil Collins performs "Take Me Home": Elton John 
performs "Your Song" and "Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me"; all the artists join Paul McCartney on stage for a finale of "Kansas City"; and more.
