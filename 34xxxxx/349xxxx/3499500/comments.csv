hey retard, SquareCo and SquareEnix are not the same thing: These new FF7 games and shit, are NOT canon; they are made by a different staff of different people from a different company than who made the original FF7 game. 

If you actually played FF7 before Square went down under (near bankruptcy), before the ""merger"", then you'd know that this is true. 

Yes, of course, Snowfields is just a fanfic (duh) but feels WAY more canon than Advent Children. 

And if you didn't know about it then that proves your ignorance. It's the greatest fanfic ever written. And before this ""Compilation of FF7"" bullshit (retardation rather than compilation) it was very well known among all the fanfics to be the best one. 

But then of course Enix made a CG movie filled with fanservice and instantgratificationjunk based on zero plot and with no character development... so of course people forgot all about the realm of fanfiction and sheepishly licked the boots of their new Enix masters. "
