,tomazahlin,2006-06-26T21:35Z,U YEA !! thanks a lot !
,forgetit,2006-06-26T23:05Z,thanks!
,rdvenom,2006-06-26T23:22Z,"The game still crashes with this crack.  Also after the last crash I can no longer load my saved game, it just crashes right away.  Dont know if its bugs in the game or a problem with the crack but its very annoying because the game is pretty cool."
,Nixina,2006-06-27T00:39Z,"Fuck! its like rdvenom says, it still crashes with this crack.. i played for about 2 hours and was happy as hell and though this problem finally was solved.. but no no no :( it crashed once and since that it crashes everytime im trying to enter and load game, and this time its .EXE error when its crashing and not only the ""die-motherfucker-die"" error.. is there no bug-fix or anything released that fix this problem.. its driving me crazy.. buuhuu :Â´("
,Rheikon,2006-06-27T04:50Z,ya it seems to be a problem with the crack and the unleashed release maybe. it always crashes when i use a portal and then wont load the save. then if you go back to the old asr -r method it will load again.....
,RadicalMotE,2006-06-27T09:17Z,TY RELOADED!!! :D
,Mighty Sheep,2006-06-27T10:48Z,"the whole PC crashes when using this crack.
im using UNLEASHED game and RELOADED crack.
any help?"
,Jaegarns,2006-06-27T15:18Z,"Ive got it to work now, i used this crack and got the problem with loading (crashed when loading). So i just tried some stuff, i opened the .Mds file with deamon tools, and under ""Emulation"", i checked all. Opened the game, loaded my warrior, and it worked. Try that :)"
,Bamimi,2006-06-27T17:38Z,"I'm using the torrent 'Titan.Quest.DvD.MuLTi5-TXT' dvd image and this crack is working fine. at leats so far anyways. don't directly load a saved game, just hit continue and I appear at the last save well as normal. good luck guys."
,BlakIdPea87,2006-06-28T10:46Z,"I have the original EMU mds version and it crashed every 5 minutes until I burned the dvd using Alcohol with RMPS enabled....crashes went away.

this RELOADED crack also works perfectly...only one crash in 10+ hours now. "
,Mighty Sheep,2006-06-29T13:55Z,"''this RELOADED crack also works perfectly...only one crash in 10+ hours now.''

lies, crashes after 5-10 minutes."
,tomazahlin,2006-07-04T12:40Z,"Try disabling the SFX sound in game. If it helps, please write in here."
,zapper86,2006-07-11T13:50Z,anybody found a solution?
,vogg,2006-07-13T15:32Z,"Disabling the SFX helps, I never crash with SFX sound off anymore. Bit boring without that sound but you can enable/disable during the game when u want it on.. and if it crashes you can load that ""crashed"" character by disabling SFX in the menu before loading. Thanks to Tomazahlin for that"
,Flugfarfar,2006-07-15T14:24Z,"It crashes when I try to load my char even with SFX disabled. It is different for everyone. But I'm gonna try with what Jaegarns wrote, because I've got the same ver as he."
,Flugfarfar,2006-07-15T14:26Z,"Oh no I haven't, it's only the crack fix that is .mds... Did he mean that one?"
,Nikko1990,2006-07-21T10:59Z,where can i get the original .exe file im gonne try to use sd4hide
,rincing_quince,2006-07-30T11:15Z,many of you are talking about 'reloaded' or 'reloaded files' (and sometimes also 'unleashed'). can someone please explain to me what this means? thnx 
,plutoniumboy,2006-08-01T14:35Z,"Guys, stop throwing shit at eachother, arguing about how often it crashes..

my mate who is sitting besides me now, have played the game for 4 days with the crack,.. and it works perfectly, he have only had 1 crash.. 

but me, i need to use the crash fix, the game crashed every 5 minutes and i couldnt start it again without restarting my PC..

the crack may work for some, if your lucky
but i encourage everyone to use the crashfix, if you manage to get it right it will probably fix all problems.."
,golubm,2006-08-06T21:17Z,PE
,golubm,2006-08-06T21:21Z,"PEOPLE, THE SOLUTION IS SIMPLE. DOWNLOAD THE PATCH 1.08 AND THEN USE THE CRACK FOR A 1.08 VERSION. ITs DIFFRENT, AND IT WORKS! I AM PLAYING THE GAME ON MULTYPLAYER WITH 3 OTHER FRIENDS, AND WITH THE OLD CRACK IT COULDNt EVEN START! you're welcome"
,golubm,2006-08-09T03:02Z,DONT EVEN WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS CRACK(Titan.Quest.CRACK.ONLY-RELOADED)! IT DOESNT WORK...
,SicKn3sS,2006-08-13T00:23Z,wrong nfo XD
,frankbruno999,2006-08-15T00:31Z,"i had the same problem, crashed when loading saved game. Unistall the whole game and then re-install. Before downloading the crack install the v1.08 patch for titan quest and then download the crack and replace the .exe file. Mine now works fine. :D"
,golubm,2006-08-15T19:23Z,frankbruno999 THATS JUST WHAT I SAID
,frankbruno999,2006-08-15T19:39Z,"yeh i no, but the two comments after yours didn't seem to agree, so i thought i would re-enforce your point. ok?"
,golubm,2006-08-16T13:47Z,FOR SURE
,drummerdude,2006-08-23T21:38Z,"I have version 1.08 and the crack for version 1.08.. but when i went to play multiplayer the game was updating for like 10 minites and then closed and said ""need version 1.08...and that the version was UNKNOWN""

anyone know how to play multiplayer that works?"
,golubm,2006-08-28T14:32Z,"ARE YOU REALY SURE THAT IT IS A 1.08 VERSION? COUSE YOU CAN SEE WHAT VERSION IT IS WHEN YOU START THE GAME.
I PLAYED ON MULTIPLAYER WITH 3 OTHER FRIENDS AND WE ALL HAD A 1.08 VERSION. ITs GREAT!"
,golubm,2006-08-28T14:34Z,MAYBE YOU NEED DIFFRENT serials? TRY
,Cait^^,2006-08-31T15:20Z,"You might havn't the right release.
Are you sure you've donwloaded 06.26.06.Titan.Quest-RELOADED
And not any other release"
,gorignak123,2006-09-28T21:13Z,"sweet upload, btw use the serials from the NFO to get started they work great."
