This is the complete Freespace II game. To run this game, simply unpack this folder with WinRar, then run the CD Images (ISO files) on a Daemon Tools. Daemon Tools makes fake CD and DVD drives on your computer, so the game thinks you have the CD in the CD drive.


Got these from FreeSpaceZone.com
That\'s probably a quicker way to download... I was getting down speeds of 500k or better, but if for some reason these site is down, here\'s the torrents.
