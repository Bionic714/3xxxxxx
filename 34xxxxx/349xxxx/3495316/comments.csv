,mindtempest,2007-12-05T03:50Z,"im actually laughing at those who beg for seeds. This torrent is actually the highest-seeded one for ES3, and im getting 100+k dl. Pls config your client properly before spamming up the box. And as a general rule of thumb, if lots of peers spam the comments with 'WHY CANT THIS WORK' instead of 'VIRUS' or 'CORRUPTED' it most likely does."
,nitesh201,2007-12-09T16:57Z,nice! i bought oblivion for the Xbox 360 but I have to wait until christmas to open the xbox and the game. This is a great torrent and a great way to familiarize myself with the elder scrolls world. SEEDING!

we i go into no cd crack folder and try to open the morrowind shortcut by double clicking the icon, it says the following
""This application failed to start because binkw32.dll was not found. Re-installing the application may fix the problem.""

ok so i downloaded the binkw32.dll file to my desktop but i hav no idea where it belongs for the game to run.

also, i do hav an image of the game and i'v burned it to a dvd but i hav no idea how to get the game to run from this point.


someone wiser than me, PLZ HELP
IM BEGGING YOU
MORROWIND IS A PHAT GAME
HELP"
,Shadie_19,2007-12-17T04:35Z,ok  this is for  goochbrow    im not sure if u no that the crack has to be copied to the folder that u installed morrowind into  (ex. C:\program files\bethseda studios\morrowind  or somthin like that) the reason y it keeps tellin u it cant find bink32.dll is becuase it has to read it from where it was installed inside the morrowind game folder u cant take it out and put it on ur desktop    im sry if this didnt help u but im answering ur question as to how i understood it   so retry the crack and copy it to the folder with all ur morrowind data  and if it doesnt work download ur own crack
,thewebhound,2007-12-24T08:34Z,u have to copy the NO CD crack to the game folder and then mount the ISO file in Deamon or Alcohol 120. Then run it.
,christopheranglin,2008-01-02T20:18Z,"i dont get it, i try to open morrowind through the no cd crack folder and it tells me it needs a cd. i'm kind of new to this... any instrutions?"

,endotherm,2008-01-12T00:41Z,hmmm i put the no cd crack folder in c/programfiles/bethesda...../ and mounted the bethesda thing on daemon. it still says that there is no cd even when i mount the crack. any ideas?
,achnoidzz,2008-01-12T17:30Z,"Hey.. I need some help with this game, when I download it and then try to install it, i get an error message that i should free up space on the harddrive that i installed the TES Construction Set on. But i do not have the Construction set, ergo no installation. What can I do? Just download a construction set or a new morrowind?"
,endotherm,2008-01-12T23:05Z,"yay i fixed mine! all i did was installed the Setup.exe if u have winrar, then put no-cd crack in the morrowind folder not bethesda. then in daemon i mounted ""Game Image"" found at C:/downloads/TheElderScrolls...../gameimage/some
thingrar. it worked but now i have this problem that says ""Render Creation Error: ""Unknown frame buffer mode."""" soooo i need help with this, cuz  i lost my original game so thats y i d/l this one heh. Great game tho!"
,endotherm,2008-01-12T23:09Z,"to achnoidzz

I dont think u need to d/l anything, i didnt, all i did was install it automatically. U could ignore the message, but u could also uninstall some stuff which is what i did, but the TES file is already there. i dont know what ur comp is saying but make sure ur not tapering the install files, just install it."

,colb182,2008-01-26T19:27Z,"why when i run the no cd crack that is in the morrowind folder it loads then an error comes up

""Font 0 not found in .\Morrowind.ini.
Current path: C:\Program Files\Bethesda Softworks\Morrowind\No-Cd Crack.""

but if i run the regular installed program it works fine until it passes the point in the start up logos and stuff then it closes and says ""would you like to send an error report to microsoft""

is there somethign i did wrong? can someone help me?"
,daconic,2008-01-27T05:30Z,"Great game. Recommend to ANYONE... play Oblivion, THEN play This. All you'll want, is this with Oblivion's graphics.

And to those who CANT EVER SEEM TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO INSTALL PROGRAMS ... read the readme. If you can't follow instructions, too bad. If no instructions, it's not difficult.

And if you like the game (You will love this), dont be a cheap ass and sring $20 for a classic. They deserve it for masterpiece's like this. No support, no more good games... "
,motorhead1,2008-02-05T17:12Z,"wtf are leechers anyway lol

and anyway cmon guys if only one person was seeding its only 675.mb......"
,Shmittyz,2008-02-17T07:53Z,"Awesome game.. Had one issue, after install I kept getting an error about Font 0 not found in Morrowing.ini.  Very easy fix!  Download PowerISO.  Open The .daa file with PowerISO and burn a disc with the image.  Shut down all anti-virus programs, and disconnect from the net til after installation is through.  Run nothing but the Installer from the disc.  After install is finished you may re-enable your ant-virus software, and your net connection.  And play game.  Either from the disc or since you have powerISO mount the disc image to your PowerISO virtual drive and use that for the disc.. Good to go at that point... No CD crack is not required.. Trust me, never used No CD crack.  Game Works like magic..  10 stars!!!"
,Shmittyz,2008-02-17T08:01Z,BTW Seeder here so don't bash...  If I download something I think is worth it.  I will seed for 24 hours at the least..  This is worth it so maybe more!! Also the installer is very touchy...  That is why I mentioned shutting down virus scanners and your net..  Mounting on Alcohol 120 or other virtual drives will work fine but only on high end systems due to the installers finicky behaviour.  Maybe a good idea to use one of these programs and burn a bootable disc.. Alot easier to use.  Any questions on errors messege me on yahoo messenger s/n daiseyllucas!
,the_coogie_kid,2008-02-28T06:19Z,i need help there is no image file!!!
,reeferr,2008-03-22T04:12Z,"Can anyone help me?

I installed the Game perfectly and put the NoCD Crack in the right place but when i run it i get this annoying error

,reeferr,2008-03-22T07:46Z,"Nvm People i found a fix by googling it and ill share it with people with the ""Font 0 not found"" error.

after you install it simply go to the Morrowind folder and open up the file called  ""Morrowind"" with notepad and change everything in there to this http://yacoby.silgrad.com/MW/Tuts/IniTut/IniPopup/StockMorroini.htm
then save it and run Morrowind and enjoy"

now... stop whining, okies? :)"
,RequiemsFall,2008-04-15T09:17Z,"OK, here is the definitive way to install this game.

First things first, open My Computer.

Now open C drive.

You'll see Program Files. Open that.

Keep Program files open, and minimize it.

Now fully install Morrowind.

Open the Morrowind Folder from your torrent download folder.

You'll see the No Crack folder, open it.

There should be a black and steel colored icon that says:

Morrowind
Morrowind
Bethesda Softworks

,with the icon above it. Now, select and copy this icon.

Pull up the minimized Program Files folder up, and refresh it, so as to reveal the just installed Bethesda Softworks folder.

Open the Bethesda Softworks folder.

Open the Morrowind folder.

In the Morrowind folder, there is another icon that looks exactly the same as the one in the no crack file. However, when you paste the copied Crack file, it will ask you to replace the one in the Mprrowind folder. Notice they are 2 different sizes. If you are not promptedby this screen, you must delete the Morrowind icon and THEN replace it with the no crack file. 

Only then will the game not crash during the opening credits.

You're welcome.And others, please spell correctly and list full directions for the shit you seed...

,mrpinkeye85,2010-08-23T13:09Z,"CAN SOMEONE JUST STOP AND HELP! its all very well you lot saying ""it works fine"" but why not let us know what you do and what system you are on! iv mounted loads of iso's before and understand the process. i also understand about the cd crack. iv installed, uninstalled, reinstalled, downloaded patches and other cracks, updated my video driver, updated direct x, and amillion other bloody things and the game still does not work. i am on win7 starter and the game installs fine but crashes on start up. iv never seen a second of the game, just a small black box and then ""morrowind has stopped working"" windows error message. now....can someone just explain why this is? and dont say ""it works fine"" cause it obv doesnt!"
,mrpinkeye85,2010-08-23T13:11Z,"and i cant burn to a disc cause im on a netbook, should this really matter? i usually mount the iso file"
,OnixFrog,2010-09-22T20:28Z,"Not working. I had mounted plenty of files to know what to look for, there's no ISO file in the package. Re-installed five times, nothing have changed. So now I'm getting the ""CD is missing"" message and can't even get a glimpse of the game. What a waste of space this torrent was."
,mr_killjoyos,2010-10-05T04:20Z,"dude this torrent dowloaded in 20 minutes for me

i love you 0.0"
,tommara,2010-10-18T12:06Z,"I too had trouble with the 'No cd inserted' message (Windows 7) even after copying the no cd crack to the Morrowind directory. I eventually got it working by mounting the iso file again where it then worked. So in essence, the No cd crack doesn't work, althoguh mounting the iso (a.k.a. inserting the cd) makes teh game work."
,Morphizis,2010-10-20T12:13Z,It took less than 10 minutes for me. Thankyou!!
,onthe1,2010-10-27T11:13Z,This may be the answer to most of people's problems: I've hear Morrowind doesn't work well with windows 7

""RequiemsFall at 2008-04-15 09:17 CET:
OK, here is the definitive way to install this game.

First things first, open My Computer.

Now open C drive.

You'll see Program Files. Open that.

Keep Program files open, and minimize it.

Now fully install Morrowind.

Open the Morrowind Folder from your torrent download folder.

You'll see the No Crack folder, open it.

There should be a black and steel colored icon that says:

Morrowind
Morrowind
Bethesda Softworks

,with the icon above it. Now, select and copy this icon.

Pull up the minimized Program Files folder up, and refresh it, so as to reveal the just installed Bethesda Softworks folder.

Open the Bethesda Softworks folder.

Open the Morrowind folder.

In the Morrowind folder, there is another icon that looks exactly the same as the one in the no crack file. However, when you paste the copied Crack file, it will ask you to replace the one in the Mprrowind folder. Notice they are 2 different sizes. If you are not promptedby this screen, you must delete the Morrowind icon and THEN replace it with the no crack file. 

Only then will the game not crash during the opening credits.

You're welcome.And others, please spell correctly and list full directions for the shit you seed..."""
,hanzo2012,2012-05-25T01:56Z,"Oh one more thing, make sure you download Daemon Tools Lite. It's free. You'll need it to open this disk image file"
,itsnotboo,2012-05-29T17:51Z,"i have the same problem before. so what i did is i downloaded ALCOHOL 52% from the internet its 
free dont worry. 

install the game first. then download then install alcohol 52%. 

after installing open alcohol 52% then on the leftside corner click on the virtual drive. then make sure that you select "" 1 "" in the ""Number of Virtual drives"" 

then open my computer  and right click on the dvd drive (F:) and select ""Mount Image"" then find the morrowind iso. The iso file is the original file that you downloaded. It is in the ""Game image"" folder.

it should work fine. it worked for me so good luck guys :DD"

,ratedloud,2012-08-14T02:30Z,"This is the most seeded Morrowind torrent, yet the crack is crap.  Doesnt work unless you have the iso mounted.  Ive tried every version of the crack on gamecopyworld and Im no noob.  Try another torrent pwople"
