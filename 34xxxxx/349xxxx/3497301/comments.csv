,thatsmine,2006-06-22T15:23Z,"Awesome !!! i hope u will also up the other 2 parts because they didn't have Dutch subs  ;-)
thanx for this great Up  *_*"
,Invictus_,2006-06-22T17:25Z,You can get the DVD's with Dutch-subs for around 7 euro's a piece at your local 'BoekenVoordeel' (boekenvoordeel.nl); buy them so Rick & Adrian receive some royalties.
,Invictus_,2006-06-22T17:31Z,"Owh and 'BoekenVoordeel' sells 'Guesthouse Paradiso' and 'Believe Nothing' on DVD; also around 7 euro's. 

BTW, additional tracker is demonoid."

,Invictus_,2006-06-26T07:22Z,"@thatsmine
Shame, the pirating scene only works with a certain number of people buying stuff thus financing a certain number of people creating stuff.

,Hamurabi,2007-05-20T23:29Z,"This is an old torrent indeed but it seems to be alive so I'll comment it anyway.

joddla76 commented in swedish which is a perfectly natural language to comment in on a SWEDISH web site.

Noone would welcome dutch people's endevour to have their own pirate-bay-like site more than I but apperently being almost twice as many as the swedes hasn't enabled them to find ONE person knowledgable enough to set up such a site."
,Hamurabi,2007-05-20T23:46Z,"In light of my previous comment:

Do note that torrents in any language with any kind of subtitles are welcomed here as well as comments in other languages. However don't:

1) Post torrents implicitly assuming (i e without saying) that people speak language X unless X is English or Swedish. I once spent a lot of time downloading a computer game only to find out that it was only in polish (and impossible to play to non polish speakers). I am sure that 97% of the downloaders were in this situation because nowhere did it say ""polish"". This was an incredable waste of band width!

2) Criticise people for writing in Swedish. This is a Swedish site. It is every file sharing persons duty to try to get a similar service going in their home country and until they do I'm sure that people will excuse them but they should hardly be drawing attention to their inferiority!

Finally, thanks to Invictus_ for sharing this torrent."
