Bottom Series 3 - DVD5ISO - Dutch Subs

What can I say? The third DVD with all six episodes of the series and a small bonusvid with some 'things gone wrong' stuff. Series one and two are around (TPB I think) but this one wasn't. Rippend and compressed with DVDShrink 3.2; gives a nice quality. Nothing removed; menu compressed to the max; episodes & fluff around 60%; copyright replaced with the only True Lord. Only one audiotrack (English ofc) and only one language subs; Dutch.

Episodes: Hole, Terror, Break, Dough, Finger & Carnival (all around 30min)
Extra: 13min Fluf

Because I'm bandwithwise 'challenged' getting a propper seedcount will take 2-3 days. In the meantime, have a wank! (When this is up I think I'll up Believe Nothing next.)

Enjoy!
