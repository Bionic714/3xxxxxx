,MisterSmee,2006-06-16T01:37Z,"It does have screens, you have some plugin or other problem with the browser. It's the same old bottle blonde doing the same old thing."

,Vampyre_Byte,2006-11-01T18:22Z,"No ""spyware"", pop-ups and the like, but that's it.  If you can't see the pic it's definintely due to your browser not being set up right, or at least not right to view the pics.  As in Active Scripting disabled.. which isn't always a bad thing."
