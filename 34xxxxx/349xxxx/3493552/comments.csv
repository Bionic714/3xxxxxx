,bobby1123581321,2006-06-25T11:30Z,seed plz
,Furazela,2006-06-26T18:44Z,"I am seeding, and have been for the last couple of months. I'm now up to a ratio of 148.803, and I'm still seeding, so don't bloody complain at me!!!"
,Furazela,2006-07-26T15:31Z,"Cited from description:
Only a selected few hardware DVD players will be able to play the episodes. The keywords to look for in the supported formats section of the technical specification is ""OGG"", ""Vorbis"" and ""Xvid"". If you don't like reading technospeech you can just burn some episodes on a CD or DVD and try."
,Discotheque,2006-09-01T15:34Z,"Fantastic!.. I've been looking for this so long and so much just to find out that i've been spelling the name wrong, been spelling rosswell and not roswell, omg this is great. Thanks."
,Lanix,2006-12-27T23:38Z,ogm? Yeah that's good...too bad no DVD-players support that crap. Like I'd want to watch TV on my computer...
,pirate1,2007-02-06T17:16Z,"Does anybody have the Norwegian subtitles for Roswell?
If so, please upload them! :)"
,Furazela,2007-04-04T10:23Z,"Lanix: Some DVD players do play OGG/XVID/Vorbis files, some people have their computers connected to their TV's and some people do watch using their computer. I'm in the later group myself, but I know people in the first two groups as well. I'm seeding this as a service to those people. If you don't like it, rip it yourself."
,willywho,2007-04-09T04:59Z,"Hi--as of April 8/07 there are no seeds!! Please seed!!! 

Thank You"
,acken,2007-04-18T17:30Z,Seed plz it takes forever -.-
,Arre90,2007-04-23T19:43Z,"Furazela, if he had the ABILITY to rip it himself, e.g. if he had roswell S1. Then he wouldn't need to download it would he?
And Lanix, as well as everyone else who'd rather watch it on the tv than on the computer: don't worry.
ConvertXtoDVD can handle that, although it takes quite a long time to convert stuff."
,casinoboy2,2007-11-26T12:39Z,"The files come up as .ogm files...is there any way to convert these files to xvid or another format so I can play them in my divx  or windows media player?  I downloaded an .ogg player but the sound is bad, I don't know if it's the player or the files themselves."
,x626,2008-01-04T03:47Z,Anyone else having issues with the CRC check failing?
,wolfrune,2008-01-09T03:39Z,"please seed...

,estrom,2008-01-18T18:18Z,"I need some help, please! I have VLC, but when playing the downloaded files, I only get sound, no video. Any tips?? Thanks"
[V],Kuthumi,2008-08-13T15:40Z,I have now uploaded the original movie at http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4341654/Roswell_(1994)_movie_-_The_UFO_cover-up_(New_QualityDVDrip)
,Destaone,2009-04-17T17:12Z,Thanks for the upload! Not so many thanks for the restrikted ways to actually look at it....
,Mina993,2010-12-25T18:16Z,"I am currently downloading this and I noticed that every episode freezes up on sec. 4, but the sound goes on. Then after about 10sec it's normal, but then again freezes the picture, and the sound goes on... Is it just me, or has this happened to someone else???? Please help!!!"
,travelner,2012-07-31T00:16Z,Almost all the episodes are broken!
