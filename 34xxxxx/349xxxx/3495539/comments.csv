,vanTorX,2006-06-19T05:30Z,"partway through downloading, I played a bit of what I got and like it, must have been some work with the front menu I say, looks good, only one thing I would wish for is French soundtrack, surely it was there wasn't it? but it might have reduced quality of the main movie, I suppose you are Spanish, English is then second mandatory lang and French seems like outsider

thx anyway"
,vanTorX,2006-06-19T05:31Z,"except I'd say when it comes to things like TinTin, there French is pretty well a must IMO

I'd say consider uploading simple rip, what is it, some 7.5g vs 4.3g and then let people split it on couple normal DVDs or burn on doublelayer

The original release has no French language and trust me, that shock me.

If anyone has the French language and can upload just the .ac3Â´s files I would be really happy :wink:"

Dear keerkegan

Could you please seed/upload the complete torrent of ""Pirates of the Caribbean - The lost disc"" at least once then I will seed it for a min of 2 years(& forever if I upgrade my 120gb hard drive.)

I know that this torrent was made in 2006,but even now there are more than 12 people including me who are all stuck at "" 64.1% "" (I have been waiting for over a month & a half , only then I decided to post this comment.)
We require just 1 seeder for just a couple of days, thats all !! just for a couple of days !!

Please !!! This is a potc special disc and should be available to all the pirates forever, it should not die down so soon(This is the only torrent that has this special disc, hence much more the importance of seeding it)

If you would seed it at least once more then many people, including me would be grateful to you


PS : I have posted this comment on all your torrent detail sections. If you have read this then please ignore it and sorry for bothering you everywhere  :P"
,tmboyz,2010-01-03T06:03Z,feautiful movie!! nah
