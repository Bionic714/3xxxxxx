,BlackDahlia,2006-07-12T08:15Z,"I'm looking for the Scientific American book ""Altered States of Awareness"" from the 70's - 80's which they gave out as an incentive for subscribing to the magazine. It discussed various drugs including Marijuana and came to the conclusion that the President's Commission on Marijuana and Drug Abuse was correct in reccommending that Marijuana be decriminalized. Nixon, of course, ignored that reccommendation from his own commission."
