[V],Hexen-NI,2006-06-09T01:06Z,"Does anyone know where the other 13 torrents went to?

Should I upload the torrents again?"
,eminenz,2006-06-09T04:07Z,"hexen-nl, you are amazing! thanks for your supreme efforts and generosity!
okay, as to your question (re-up?): i'd wait a few days to see if the torrents reappear. earlier this week when the site came back online i searched and found all your l&h torrents listed. so they may come back. what's more, i was in the early stages of leeching a dvd-r when the lights went out here - people kept seeding, so don't assume the other seeds are dead just because they don't show up on the db.
thanks again!"
,daqck,2006-06-09T04:19Z,"i was uploading ufc 8 as it went down but kept it going and i seeded until half of them got it, then it was there turn. as was mentioned it was still going until a couple of days ago, as again as mentioned wait till you see what happens.
did you hear about the guy that won the money on the tv game show and donated a few grand to TPB. http://thepiratebay.org/blog.php"
,jonahx,2006-06-09T07:19Z,"yeah, i think i missed #13, so plz reupload the torrent for that one.. Im sure the seeders are still here."
,wolf359,2006-06-09T15:56Z,"I lost all my torrents as well.I don't think they will reappear.F****** authorities!!! Do they really think they will stop it? Maybe they wouldn't have a problem if prices weren't such a rip-off.They don't give money back if you go back and say it was shyte do they.

,josepski,2006-06-09T16:37Z,I am still seeding 11-12-13. so there must be some traffic out there
,molken99,2006-06-09T16:54Z,"mmm, even can't download this one anymore.... """"hostname not found"" in u-torrent. Anyone any idea ????"
,molken99,2006-06-09T17:59Z,"Right, already found the answer: Have to enable DHT to download....I didn't have to on the other 13....

Thanx Hexen !!!!! JUST GO ON !!!!"
,spongeee,2006-06-09T21:01Z,"wait a while, i agree, see what happens first. we can get the snowball rolling again easy.
Stan and Ollie are so good, thanks to all uploaders out there!"
,thatsmine,2006-06-09T21:52Z,"i too have seen the L&H torrents till recently but now i can't find them anymore , but i assumed it's because the search option doesn't work. As i also couldn't find this vol.14 with search ...i just browse trough all torrents and there it is ! so i think all volumes are still running !
Thanx for Vol.14 Hexen !!!  if there's no seeder on any of the older volumes then i think it's best to say it here ! "
[V],Hexen-NI,2006-06-10T04:25Z,"I've recorded all the URL's to all pervious 13 torrents (DVD 5 is http://thepiratebay.org/details.php?id=3445938&rating=5), however it says No Torrent Exists.  I'll wait to see if they come back.

Anyway, 14 we're at the two-thirds stage now!!!

I have to stop initial seeding for the next 12 hours - sorry, completely unavoidable."
,steenbokje64,2006-06-10T08:07Z,please if you go to an other one let us know and keep on seeding they are graeth classics
,Dxj,2006-06-11T16:20Z,"Thanks 4 this one!

Dirty Work is one of my favorite!"
,Dxj,2006-06-11T16:22Z,There is seeder's on the other volumes ;)
,Zeldiana,2006-06-13T18:27Z,"I love you Hexen You are the best except for Stan and Ollie

WTG"
,thatsmine,2006-06-16T06:57Z,"Thanx !!! soundtrekker , thats a nice compensation to the other seeders who have a slow upload speed (like myself with only 40 kb)

But i think pirate bay will be offline soon again because it has changed AGAIN from server in holland because BREIN is after them (dutch organisation against illigal torrents)

Sooo please hurry up with vol.15 Hexen-Ni hehe"
,Clansman-uk,2006-06-24T18:14Z,"Volumes 1 - 4,8 & 9 torrents are now showing up on the search option"
,peter7a,2006-06-24T19:14Z,"I'm hoping to see volume 13, missed it amid all the past excitement."
,denzel-uk,2006-06-24T22:15Z,"Hi hexen, glad 2 see these still being upped/seeded, i was away for a month or so though and missed 11, 12 and 13..is there a chance these will be seeded? thanks"
,thatsmine,2006-07-02T21:24Z,"15 = gone again ? but i have it anyways :P

please upload 16 , u said u would fire it away as soon as it was seeded ..wel it is ! for 2 days already  ;-)"
,denzel-uk,2006-07-03T03:45Z,"i for one have been checking in here and searching and not seen 11-13 lately..
and certainly not 15."
,IgStar,2006-07-05T20:37Z,"Please, anybody who has it... Will you please seed/post vol 13 again. This is the only one I have missed."
,tonius1978,2006-09-16T12:14Z,"I only miss number 12, can somebody upload this dvd please?"
,ruthje,2007-01-12T14:27Z,Thanx a lot still missing number 13
,Drowlord,2008-01-09T20:31Z,"TPB deleted a few of these Hexen-NI Laurel and Hardy torrents because of outdated trackers and external tracker urls in the torrent.  I have found them all on other tracker sites, and attempted to correct them for posting on TPB.  However, I thought I knew how to do that, but when I tried it it appeared that I would have to remove trackers that contained active seeds and I didn't want to create a gimpy torrent.  So... I created a torrent filled with all of Hexen-NI's torrents.  Kinda lame, I Know.  Here it is: http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3969220/Laurel_and_Hardy_DVD_Vol_1-21_Torrents_by_Hexen-NI

Also... I've ripped all of these DVD's to XviD, and I'll post a torrent with these soon (when my seeding capacity isn't saturated by all these ISO's)"
,Drowlord,2008-02-10T18:33Z,"As promised, the entire collection's DVD Rips in XviD format: http://thepiratebay.org/tor/4021071/Laurel_and_Hardy_Movies_-_DVDRips_-_142_Movies"
