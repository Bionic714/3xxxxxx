This is an annoying problem when playing the game backed up to the HDD. On Peragus, the game begins to act strangely. After your T3 droid gets zapped, the game goes to a black screen. The only way to resolve this is to save and load, then you find yourself in a situation where you are your Jedi character. This is a glitch! If you go back to the fuel depot you will turn into your broken T3 unit and not be able to do anything.

I ran into this problem as well. I tried the original disc and found that that worked perfectly.

To test, I created and burned an ISO onto DVD-R and found that the backup DVD worked perfectly as well. I then began poking around the game files I'd FTP'ed to my PC and I discovered the ""swdirsXbox.ini"" file that was previously mentioned here.

This is the original INI file from the game as it appears on the original game disc:

Original ""swdirsXbox.ini"" file from KotOR II
CODE
[Alias]
HD0=d:\
OVERRIDE=d:\Override
ERRORTEX=d:\Errortex
TEMP=z:\Temp
MODULES=d:\Modules
LOGS=t:\Logs
LOCALVAULT=d:\LocalVault
DMVAULT=d:\DMVault
SERVERVAULT=d:\ServerVault
STREAMMUSIC=d:\STREAMMusic
TEMPCLIENT=z:\Tempclient
SAVES=u:\
CURRENTGAME=z:\currentgame
TEXTUREPACKS=d:\texturepacks
STREAMWAVES=d:\StreamWaves
GAMEINPROGRESS=z:\GAMEINPROGRESS
REBOOTDATA=z:\rebootdata
LIPS=d:\Lips


As you can It references the ""d:"" directory many times. I figured, why not change those instances to the actual game directory when running from the HDD?

So I revised the file by replacing each mention of d: with f:\games\Star Wars KotOR II. The latter is the directory you are most likely copying to. This will be the directory that 99% of people have backed up to. If you backed up elsewhere, you will obviously have to change to the appropriate game directory.

The resulting INI file should look like this:

Modified ""swdirsXbox.ini"" file from KotOR II
CODE
[Alias]
HD0=f:\games\Star Wars KotOR II
OVERRIDE=f:\games\Star Wars KotOR II\Override
ERRORTEX=f:\games\Star Wars KotOR II\Errortex
TEMP=z:\Temp
MODULES=f:\games\Star Wars KotOR II\Modules
LOGS=t:\Logs
LOCALVAULT=f:\games\Star Wars KotOR II\LocalVault
DMVAULT=f:\games\Star Wars KotOR II\DMVault
SERVERVAULT=f:\games\Star Wars KotOR II\ServerVault
STREAMMUSIC=f:\games\Star Wars KotOR II\STREAMMusic
TEMPCLIENT=z:\Tempclient
SAVES=u:\
CURRENTGAME=z:\currentgame
TEXTUREPACKS=f:\games\Star Wars KotOR II\texturepacks
STREAMWAVES=f:\games\Star Wars KotOR II\StreamWaves
GAMEINPROGRESS=z:\GAMEINPROGRESS
REBOOTDATA=z:\rebootdata
LIPS=f:\games\Star Wars KotOR II\Lips


After modifying the file the game worked perfectly. No black screen, no getting stuck as the broken T3 droid.

I hope this helps people experiencing a similar problem when backing up to their HDD. smile.gif"
