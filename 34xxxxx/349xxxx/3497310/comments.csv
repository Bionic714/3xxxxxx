,sargonTPB,2009-09-20T08:13Z,"It's obvious that you guys never lived under a fucking communist regime. Otherwise you wouldn't praise a scum... every utopian and revolutionist in history is a criminal, a potential dictator and an evil mind"
,skippythekangaroo,2010-04-16T23:22Z," I know one thing about the so called US democracy it is an illusion that free elections are held, the republicans and democrats control the government because their members and the media barons and they tell the American population whom to vote for with constant ads for either party never allowing other smaller parties to have prime time air time. Yes in the United states you can vote but for either of the two major crime families ""Republicans or Democrats"".  I does not take much to influence the masses with some slick TV ads and they are brainwashed.  Has it not been said that ""It is a good think for elected officials the most people do not think."""
