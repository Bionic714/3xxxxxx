Paurex Seamless Factory 1.8 + Crack.

Seamless Factory is an easy to use texture maker that accurately stitches images into seamless patterns. The program will be useful for creating website backgrounds, program skins and original wallpapers, also it may be used in 3D modelling.

This version is basically the same as the latest, just missing a few extra formats you can save your image as and a few crappy extras. You can still use the program perfectly to create seamless textures or images without the extras and then you can save them in either JPG, BMP, GIF, PNG or TIF.

Enjoy!

This required some fair effort to find and put together so please seed!
