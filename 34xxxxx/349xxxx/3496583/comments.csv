,ThoSka,2007-02-23T23:47Z,"Great work Koeriksen! I will be one of those that will continue to seed this quality-work.

,antonio00,2008-04-02T18:57Z,"Hi everybody,
at first, congratulations for this great file, is the real repository for the history of the music. About the question of files availability, I've noticed this point: When a file download is over and you change the directory or the disc where you file is stored at your computer, it's impossible for my client (utorrent) maintain several directories for uploading (at the new access) and downloading (with the old -common- directory). Is any solution available? To change the client? Any trick for utorrent? Obviously solving that, the availability of files for exchange will increase exponentially.

Thanks. Greetins from Spain."

,Shanefpt,2010-09-04T21:30Z,"** SEED REQUEST **

This would be a real life saver if I could ever get it. To those 4 or 5 that have remained connected for the past few days... Thanks! You understand what makes a ""SHARING"" community go around! To the 30 or so leeches that pulled a hit and run, shame shame... I'm uploading more than I'm getting down. LOL! Two days on this torrent and counting. BIG thanks and ups to any seeds that connect. I'll try to boost this up to a 5+ ratio before I disconnect, and will check back once in a while after. ;-)

Great torrent Koeriksen!"
