,Sokerikukko,2006-06-04T15:26Z,"HEY!!!!! Thanks for the torrent, but what´s the point to stop seeding it? I mean it´s over 7gb so one day of seeding doesn´t quite do the trick... *hint hint*
I hope you start seeding again (when you have time etc.?)
I thank you k00lt if you could do this, there are over 60 leechers :)"
,k00lt,2006-06-07T22:27Z,switch of computer guys sry! and i get error 404 when i try to download the file to start the seed! but i will try untill it works;)
,Sokerikukko,2006-06-11T14:08Z,anynews?
,jflob,2006-06-20T10:49Z,"The last two entries in the site blog mention a 404 problem. They've been working on the database--restoring data from backups.  This is probably the problem k00lt is having with this torrent, not his machine.

He's said he'll try until it works. That's all we can ask for. (I suppose after enough time, if the site isn't squared away, a fresh torrent might be the answer instead).

But wow, this is a great share, and we should all be thanking k00lt for hanging in there despite problems with the site. Thanks!"
,k00lt,2006-06-21T18:56Z,thnx for the words jflob! im seeding like an animal;) as mutch as i can that is
,jflob,2006-06-22T02:26Z,Fantastic news k00lt! I see it's made some real progress (almost half way there!) Thanks again.
,k00lt,2006-06-22T14:05Z,i hope that tomorrow there will be some 100% out there! and i hope every single one of them will seed as mutch as possible
