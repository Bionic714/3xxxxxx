nor separate. Do you have english subs? I only found spanish subs online."

I see a few online but there are a few versions of these movies around out there."
,kbtwigs,2010-10-27T08:33Z,"Can someone please confirm that there are english subtitles in these?
I downloaded a different version of this documentary and spent ages hunting down resynced subs for part 1 & 3. Unforuntately I can't seem to find proper subs for part 2."
,chicolsd,2011-10-01T20:26Z,"This version is horrible: Not only the quality is at most a 4 out of 10, the sound is out of synch. There is another outright good version out there, look for it."
