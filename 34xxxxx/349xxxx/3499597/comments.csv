,LinLinDahlin,2006-06-30T15:48Z,Can't thank you enough for this one!!!!
,anjinash,2006-07-06T15:05Z,"Thanks for the up.  Every time I try to find this online, I get that abortion of a remake from 99.  This is, IMHO, the best (and most intelligent) ""haunted house"" movie ever put to film.  A pity to have it's memory tainted by DeBont."
,poincare,2006-07-16T21:32Z,I am again seeding this.

,NikErgo,2006-09-23T13:44Z,"If you seed this for me, I'll seed it for at least twice as long. This is an absolute classic and (insert 7 digit number here) times better than the crappy remake w/Liam Neeson and Catherine Zeta-Jones Douglas."
