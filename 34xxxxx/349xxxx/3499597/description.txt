"No live organism can continue for long to exist sanely under conditions of absolute reality; even larks and katydids are supposed, by some, to dream. Hill House, not sane, stood by itself against its hills, holding darkness within; it had stood so for eighty years and might stand for eighty more. Within, walls continued upright, bricks met neatly, floors were firm, and doors were sensibly shut; silence
lay steadily against the wood and stone of Hill House, and whatever walked there, walked alone."

This is the real thing, not the ridiculous, cheesey de Bont 1999 remake.  In glorious black and white, this film pays fairly close attention to Shirley Jackson's horror classic.  This movie is atmospheric horror, not the cheap startles and CGI generated blood and guts of the remake.  No blood and guts needed here.  There's sufficient psychological creepiness here for all.

Beautfully directed by Robert Wise ("The Day the Earch Stood Still", "The Andromeda Strain", "Sound of Music", etc.)

Well acted by all involved.  A true classic of the genre.

Includes French and Spanish subs.
