Steven Colbert's (The Colbert Report, Comedy Central) now legendary appearance at the 2006 White House Correspondent's Press Dinner in which he conducts a particularly severe "roast" of President George W. Bush. 

The president, seated only a few chairs away, can be seen restraining himself throughout the speech.

Footage provided in this torrent is comprehensive with regards to Colbert, starting with his introduction, his arrival at the podium, etc. and including his entire speech as well as the brief video presentation he plays for the dinner guests before departing.

The preceding 90 minutes of various ?speakers? at this event has naturally been removed in what I consider an act of selfless humanitarianism on my part. It is a matter of objective fact that there exists no person on earth, or otherwise, for whom said footage would contain even the most fleeting moment of interest. 

CSPAN logo can be seen in lower right corner of the screen.
