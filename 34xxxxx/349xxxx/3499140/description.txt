Venusian Arts Handbook
---------------------------------------------

Learn the secrets of the world?s top Pickup Artists! The Venusian Arts Handbook (2nd edition, 225 pages) is the ultimate reference guide for the aspiring Pick-Up Artist. It was conceived by Mystery, with many parts of it written by him personally. It also for the first time includes material from the infamous Mystery Method Instructors? Guide used to train Mystery Method instructors themselves. It was recently reviewed on a major discussion board: It separates the wheat from the chaff, the masters from the keyboard jockeys. . . .If it works, it?s in here. If it doesn?t, it?s not. And man, those guys at MM are evil geniuses they give away some pretty intense stuff. The Handbook also makes a great companion with the DVD set, but is a stand-alone reference in itself. This is the first step to achieving the lifestyle that you want - and your competition is using and enjoying...who said life was fair?
