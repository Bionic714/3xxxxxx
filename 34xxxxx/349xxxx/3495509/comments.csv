,tazrepect,2006-06-15T21:04Z,"oh yes, i will seed in mornin, during day and evening (england time), but not overnight because my isp disconnects me at that time, but dont worry, i will start seeding the following morning :-)"
,maxiam,2006-06-21T19:24Z,"Where is the seeder?
Come on tazrespect, don't bother to upload a 30GB torrent if you're not willing to seed more than 2 days!
You're just wasting our time..."
,keckle,2006-06-22T04:11Z,i got 50 % of the torrent  and i am seeding as much my Computer can handle Day and night for a long time :)
,keckle,2006-06-22T04:13Z,oops  i mean 63%
,krunchyfr0g,2006-06-22T20:24Z,"I am stuck at 53% If someone will seed the whole thing until I finish, I will seed the sucker for a month on DSL. I am a huge fan of the show, and we only get repeats in Canada (pretty much just seasons 4 and 5)"
,tazrepect,2006-06-24T21:14Z,"hi, im seeding as much as i can, but there is so many leechers, so i am currently only seeding to 1 person, wha has 63% (keckle), that way anther seeder is available to seed, i chose this person because i know they are seeding so they deserve the file, oh yeah thanks keckle and please seed once done as it will take a lot of us to seed as the file is 30 gig"
,krunchyfr0g,2006-07-05T04:39Z,tazrepect....a bunch of us are hanging at 99.3 buddy....help us out with the last bit :o)
,frolo,2006-07-05T05:24Z,maybe this is a clever little trick to make sure we all seed.
,tazrepect,2006-07-05T08:29Z,"dont worry il be seeding it in a bit, im just seeding some n-gage games that i uploaded at the moment :-)"
,trykkertor,2006-07-06T16:35Z,"Come on!
We just ned freakin 0.7% and this torrent will live by it self.
It would take you no more than a couple of hours to complete it.
Now your just keeping 400 people of us hanging."
,Nightstalker,2006-07-06T22:22Z,Pleas! some one seed! i got 99.4%!!!

,Noutaja..,2007-02-11T09:23Z,"there are a lot of people with even 100 percent but none seeding, SEED !"
,FilipM1,2007-03-17T16:18Z,"Hi! I someone could seed, please do so:) And thank you for uploading this!"
,domdie,2007-04-13T17:00Z,I HOPE I DIDN'T START DOWNLOADING THIS POINTLESLEY ; WHAT HAPPENED TO THE PEOPLE WHO KNEW TO HAVE RESPECT FOR THEMSELVES AND SEED??????????????

,Bimer1987,2007-08-12T23:48Z,Need more Seeders :)
,Timbo15,2007-08-26T12:27Z,"C'mon man, from all you guys who completed this, only 25 are good torrent users. 

SEED man, think about how you'd feel downloading 28 GiB with 5 - 10 kb/s."
,Timbo15,2007-08-26T21:55Z,"There a word desperatly needed here:


SEEDING SEEDING SEEDING!"
,NbWY1,2007-08-30T06:13Z,"Currently Downloading @ 900KB/s
Uploading @ 100KB/s

Once this download finishes, I will upcap my upstream bandwidth to about 260KB/s and seed to a 10.00 ratio. Then you will never see me again :D

Then I will limit this torrent to no more than 15KB/s and continue to seed until my computer crashed. I'd give this perhaps 3 years."
,keckle,2007-10-03T00:14Z,Thanks ...  iam only downloadin s7  and  Heaven and hell.. butt i am gonna seed a good time..
,ellobobill,2007-10-15T03:03Z,"I will be seeding the shit outta this while I'm d/l it and for awhile after.  It's bull shit that so little out of all those who have snatched it are giving back at all...even if you did only d/l an episode or two.  I have over 750 torrents seeding and I can still find the time to seed this 25+GB file!  Don't see why you couldn't do the same, even if just for a month or so.  Thanks to those who are in fact seeding.  Appreciated!"
,daveggg,2007-12-23T01:00Z,"BRILLIANT UPLOAD THANKS!!

PLEASE SEED"
,Cavi Mike,2008-01-04T10:12Z,Absolutely brilliant.
,shatroghistro,2008-01-15T01:43Z,"I would really like to seed, but my net speed is 512/64 and my fastest upload is 7 KB! My download is also low.Damn..."
,Cavi Mike,2008-01-28T10:18Z,I can't believe a month has passed and I'm only at 50%. How can a torrent with fifty seeds and SEVEN HUNDRED leeches be so slow?!
,brollan89,2008-02-03T16:21Z,"please, i have been leeching this torrent for 3 weeks now and only got 15%. the average downloadspeed is just 27 kb/s so please speed up a bit, otherwise it wont be done until summer :S"
,Kjell16,2008-02-03T22:59Z,please seed.  I love this show and I don't get it where I am from.
,StuiWooi,2008-02-06T14:03Z,Is it just me or is 07x06 missing from this torrent?
,slbm70,2008-03-02T00:27Z,"Thanks for this! 

Oh, and actually, I don't think that E06 from S07 is missing. I think they have just labled it E07. I went and checked an episode guide. The dates match and the actual season doesn't have an episode 7. That is my current deduction .. may change once I watch it :-) "
,X0D,2008-03-29T00:23Z,why is the file so small ? it can't be in a good quality? or what?
,bverd759,2008-04-01T07:04Z,"excuse me for saying, technically this is not my computer (even though my money went to upgrading >.>). So i am not supposed ot leave it on overnight (like a normal seeder does). Then out of lack of time, i cant start it in the morning, so unfortunately, its a small issue. Once i finish though, ill try to keep seeding it as much as i can. Unfortunately my upload speed in this area is garbage."
,sjanten,2008-04-22T14:25Z,pleas seed!!! @ this speed it takes 30 weeks! it has been downloading for over 2 months now... 
,vrolok_1,2008-06-07T09:25Z,"Downloaded this 2x now (got delete happy).  Great quality vids and Top Gear is always a blast to watch.

Thanks alot Tazrepect"
,dyrvold,2008-11-18T23:01Z,plz seed! i'm leaving my cp on over night.. you do that to!
,Supertuna7,2008-12-24T14:06Z,Been downloading this for the last three months.  I've been stuck at 91% for the last week or so.  the trouble is this seems to be the only comprehensive one that covers the complete 1-8 seasons.  Any tips/tricks on how to increase the speed?
,Huhnthis,2009-01-13T20:50Z,"Plz people seed.

I wil seed anything I download X 5 if You people seed."
,EonzHiglo,2009-06-11T11:10Z,Does anyone know if season 2 or 1 is BBC prime reairings with that crappy edited music?
,Hallow_Fox,2009-10-08T17:41Z,"Well I've seeded about 10 gigs worth, that's enough for this torrent.  Thanks all."
,born2bealive,2009-12-12T06:48Z,I am truly grateful for this and I hope you know just how thankful- :) Cheers & hugs mate.
,nark0z,2010-09-28T02:07Z,"64.2% on a 0.930 ratio, we need more seeders!"
,nark0z,2010-11-03T08:51Z,"I've uploaded at least 20GB, hope more people will seed..."
,stefan2011,2011-02-06T20:55Z,like :D
