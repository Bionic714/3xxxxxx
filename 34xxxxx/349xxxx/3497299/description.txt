
              NTSC DVD:

 These are two episodes of the best soap opera in the world: Santa Barbara. They were shot in 1986. Not the best quality picture and the sound of speech is slightly out of sync with the lips of characters, but it's SANTA BARBARA, THE BEST SOAP EVER!!! I'll upload the other half of the second episode later.
