Sinopsis:While shooting a jungle movie on the remote Skull Island, filmmaker Denham and his crew stumble upon a prehistoric world populated by dinosaurs and giant snakes.

Using gas bombs, Denham subdues the beast and brings him to New York City, where Kong goes on a rampage, destroying everything in his past and kidnapping a beautiful young actress.
