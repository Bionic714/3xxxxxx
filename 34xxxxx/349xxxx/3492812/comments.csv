,Coldy,2006-06-07T10:10Z,"Sry, I don't have any of the Star Treks. I upped all the seasons particularily for my friend who began to watch Stargate and now he wants all the seasons."
,Coldy,2006-06-07T10:24Z,"Dammit! I forgot to turn Netlimiter off. Ok, so after this I'll turn it off, when I goto sleep."
,janek,2006-06-07T13:20Z,"Anybody who has Stagate Atlantis s02e08, onlyone i´m missing."
,mariusm,2006-06-09T10:09Z,any seeds on this one?
[V],BBBScorpio,2006-06-14T23:13Z,Common  Coldy seed more
[V],BBBScorpio,2006-06-14T23:14Z,Janek... i posted the episode for you.. should be atleast 2 seeders by now...
,Duffie,2006-06-25T23:45Z,Isn't anyone seeding this any more. It seems to me that the health of this one goes down :(
,DiN007,2006-06-28T17:40Z,Missing the original Stargate movie....
,ni!,2006-06-29T13:00Z,I'm looking for season 8 .. can't seem to get it from this torrent.
,Coldy,2006-06-30T12:37Z,"Sry for not seeding but the computer that the files were on broke down, so I won't be able to seed this in the near future. Maybe next week if I get the PSU fixed."
,lonerLG,2006-07-09T14:49Z,"is there any chance of seeding this one again... ?
Stuck at 17,4% :("
,uberidiot713,2006-07-15T07:52Z,Anyone by chance record the season 3 opener today and would be willing to put it up?
,luisgate,2006-07-18T01:48Z,"Please, can anybody seed more. I´m stuck in 17,4%.

This is a great colection."
,luisgate,2006-07-25T05:48Z,"Please Coldy, can you tell us if you are not going to continue seeding this huge file?
Your answer will save us lot of time and bandwith.
Thanks."
,Coldy,2006-07-31T19:55Z,"Ok, so now i've got my PSU back, but now i noticed that my MB is broken so now I've got my computer for a few weeks (I wen't to a shop taht had 2 weeks of trial period to see if all the part were compitable with each other) but then I hafta get my MB to the store. After that it should take about 2 weeks and then I should be back to seed. Sorry for the mess I've caused. =( =)"
,Coldy,2006-08-01T13:39Z,I will seed usually at night Finnish time
,luisgate,2006-08-01T17:54Z,"Thank you Coldy. I will wait.
:)"
,Coldy,2006-08-06T18:27Z,Yes Iam seeding.. (I will seed usually at night Finnish time) so get your patience out from your closet
,Coldy,2006-08-07T09:53Z,"Firstly: I'm sorry that I haven't been seeding this for a few days. I was at Assembly '06 (sort of a computer demoparty), so I didn't want my ass kicked out of there just because piracy.

Secondly: There'll propably be a short disturbance today with seeding when I'll change the motherboard. I'll be a very short one, just lettin' you know that =)"
,Linked78,2006-08-08T22:14Z,"More seeding please!!!

Great torrent btw!"
,Coldy,2006-08-12T13:21Z,"Huoston we have a problem! Ok, now some bad news. The torrent is broken so i can't seed it. I'll upload the torrent again as soon as possible. So when you read this msg go n' download the reseeded torrent."
,Coldy,2006-08-12T13:34Z,"Ok, now some more bad news. It seems like I can't make a new torrent because some of the Stargate files are damaged or something. I'll try to solve the problem. Hope I'll be able to fix the problem. Please be patient."
,Coldy,2006-08-12T15:06Z,"IMPORTANT!!! Great news everybody! I've got the original torrent working, this means no reseed. Just keep downloadin' this. IMPORTANT!!!"
,Coldy,2006-08-17T06:10Z,I'll be gone for a few days so I won't be seeding. Sry.
,Coldy,2006-08-26T20:53Z,Please stay seeding this after compleeting it (even if it is just a few epis that u downloaded)! I really don't have extra bandwidth for disposal!
,Coldy,2006-09-06T21:39Z,"Ok, so now I've changed bittorrent client to utorrent. I guess it means that there'll be less crashes (I had some stabilty problems with azureus in the past). You actually might have noticed that the seeding haven't been very constant lately. Ok so I guess that was all I wanted to tell u this time. :D Happy Downloading (and seeding)! "
,lord_eridanus,2006-09-24T12:45Z,Hi there! i just wanted to say thank you for this amazing torrent. it has to be one of the most dedicated i have seen ever! keep up the great work coldy. i will be seeding this until i have a share ratio of 2:1 just to do my bit. thanks again.
,Coldy,2006-10-03T06:57Z,Thank you Lord Eridanus! :D It's nice to know people like this torrent. =)
,FAII,2006-10-09T20:56Z,"I downloaded this torrent because I wanted the specials but then it kicked into overdrive and the download speed was unbelievably high. So I'm wondering, are the episodes DVDrips or TV-rips?"
,Coldy,2006-10-10T06:56Z,The bonus episodes are probably TV-rips. S9 of SG-1 and S2 of Atlantis I think are TV-rips. The rest should be DVD-rips.
,swear,2006-11-08T21:18Z,"Perkeleen hyvä torrentti Coldy! 
Everybody who's finished, keep seeding! At least make the ratio 1:1, if not more! Thanks."
,Coldy,2006-11-19T18:45Z,"Tänx vaa itelles :D

I would also like to thank you everyone who have dowloaded this and stayed seeding this! =) I, myself can't unfortunately seed anymore, cuz my hardrive broke down. Sry. But still hope this torrent will stay alive as long as possible with the help of you all great people! :D So I'll say it once more: Thank You! =)"
,MorvindTFrst,2007-01-11T19:15Z,"Well well..... a big thanx 4 this one... Bn look for season 9 a looong time.

But... why and why is episode 12 in mp4-format??? and all others in avi-format.

Is that just a miss from your side Coldy, or what?

...anyhow. Big thanx 4 this one."
,gpf_drizit,2007-03-27T03:34Z,WOW 9 months later and this torrent is still alive and kicking.... Gota love these BIG torrents.
,happydon31,2007-03-29T08:34Z,Thanks soo much... This is one I will happily seed for a few weeks to help others get it.  Much appreciated..
,robbaN.swe,2007-05-19T22:34Z,"I have uploaded 400GB and downloaded  46GB so don't complain about the speed. I uploading 5mb/s  and downloading 20-200KB/s so i should be the one complaining... stop saying seed when 6+90 people are doing it... and stop ""HIT & RUN"" ""SNATCH & RUN"" or what a fuck you wanna call it stay and seed so every SG1 geek can see this awsome show..."
,oren,2007-07-20T01:38Z,"Can't say how thankfull I am Coldy.
I'll stick around with this torrent a while :>"
,zahbe,2007-08-17T04:58Z,"ill seed as long as i can, thanks for this torrent best show ever"
,dragontrumpetare,2007-10-15T20:25Z,"Great work man! But god, isnt there ANY swedish subs somwhere? HOw can I find them? Good quality though."
,jlasjl,2007-11-27T23:29Z,"why cant i hear the voices, the speech is to low, what can i do,  plz help..."
,Zeerover,2007-12-25T04:12Z,"heh, that's funny robbaN. From one angle, giving a lot more than you get just encourages hit and runners. Basically I just put out whatever I've been getting. I've got a fast connection probably capable of matching the whole torrents combined mbps, but I don't need a ratio of 1000:1 so a couple times a day I check it. If my ratio is .9:1 then I turn it up a bit. If it's 1.6:1 then I turn it down a bit. If someone wants to cut and run, they leave with about what they gave me.  I give a torrent about 1.5:1 The torrent can take it at whatever speed they want - 5 minutes or 5 months. Unfortunately though, I haven't seen any bit torrent client software smart enough to figure out where the bandwidth is. Seems like most of the time I'm getting (hence giving) a whopping 7-8k/Bs. I'd be happy to give 10, 20 or 30 times that, but since I'm not getting anything, I just start more torrents and let the slow ones idle along. Not much else you can do, so might as well Zen out."
,Vilzu,2008-03-30T21:17Z,"moro coldy ja kumppanit!

,The_man001,2008-04-19T08:54Z,"What program should i use to open these files? VLC doesn't work, Windows medie player doesn't either :(

I don't understand why.. It's just goddamn .AVIs!"
,Galahad68,2008-04-24T17:36Z,"Download this to encode, so after that you should be able to look at the files in Windows Mediaplayer

,Vilzu,2008-04-29T22:41Z,I can play these whit BS Player :)
,Taikeri,2008-05-27T20:50Z,"Pystyykö seedaamaan isona pakkauksena jos lataan tän osittain esim. kausi kerrallaan?
Oon aika uus bittorrenteille. :P
Nyt tulee tosin melko hitaasti toi kolmas kausi kun ykkösen ja kakkosen olen aikasemmin ladannut."
,Taikeri,2008-05-27T20:51Z,Ja en ymmärrä miks tää lähettää enemmän kun lataa kun näyttää vielä nollaa kaikissa tiedostoissa. :P
,Taikeri,2008-05-27T20:53Z,So anybody have season 3? I would appreciate if you seed it. I will seed nights and times when im not using the connection for something else.
