DD or what?"
,ruva,2006-06-29T08:28Z,"8 HD-movie same day. Do you have 100 Mb brodband?

8 HD-filmer samtidigt. Antingen vet 212 inte hur detta med p2p funkar eller så har 212 100 mb upp vilket även det kommer ta en livstid om denna delar till för många på en gång."
,modaset,2006-06-29T12:59Z,Jag har en 100Mbit lina och jag tänkte bara dela med mig till er andra :)
,erer83,2006-06-29T21:06Z,"ruva,

klaga inte så jävligt! 
tar det 2 veckor så får det väl göra det! 
Måste du sitta och titta på att mätarna ska ticka upp till 100%?!

Gå ut i friska luften istället!"
,vinryk,2006-06-30T13:17Z,"What am I supposed to write this on?
How am I supposed to play this?
Will any DVD-player be able to play 1080i?"
,ruva,2006-06-30T15:21Z,"Jag vill också ha 100Mbit lina och jag hade fel, det var andra som lade upp de andra HD-filmerna och de verkar också ha 100Mbit lina ."
,dannymc,2006-07-01T11:32Z,about 95% of the HD material i have is DD 5.1
,Whopperz,2006-07-02T19:34Z,Vinryk.. you play if from your computer to a projector or a Plasma via DVI..
,dannymc,2006-07-03T08:50Z,"HD-15 will do just as well, as will seperate RGBHV, as will component if your equipment has it, dont just need a digital connection for HD, that may change in the future in which HDMI is the chosen method"
,L01,2006-07-07T20:31Z,is there a simple (one-step) way to transcode the TS to one MPEG-file?
,VicVega,2006-07-11T13:42Z,"L01, check http://www.doom9.org for great guides."
,[DDT][X-Ray],2006-07-17T12:31Z,Disk 2 have Correupted files.. :(((
,SamSonite,2006-07-29T12:18Z,"Disc 2 was just fine, no corrupted files. Film works fine."
,xiIix,2006-08-07T07:52Z,"You fucking noobs are such a pain in the ass. These are high definition .ts files captured from an HDTV feed. They're fucking huge. Do you REALLY think there is a chance in hell this movie is going to fit on a DVD-R?

Every fucking torrent it's the same shit.. ""oh please teach me how to play/join/convert these files, because I'm lazy to do a 0.56sec google search so I can figure it out on my own"". 

It took me literally ten minutes to figure out how to join .ts files. Do us all a favor and just go to google and type in ""join play .ts file"" instead of sitting here asking us how. Because guess what, we learned how to do this stuff from searching and reading. There is NO REASON why you can't do the same thing!"
,Twilight99,2006-08-27T22:03Z,"You don't. This is a better than DVD quality HD-version. If you want to watch this movie on DVD, you should not download this."
,purge98,2007-01-18T19:48Z,"How do you play/join/convert these files please?

I'm a knob-head and arsehole twat before you ask."
,amac13,2007-01-23T08:28Z,Please someone tell me how to put this on a dvd. I'm a noob and don't know anything.
,Garoth,2007-05-15T22:57Z,Is it possible to watch this as it is on the computer?
