Movie: Superb! Great cast, great script, great directing! A really well written & acted little gem of a movie. Yes it's German and despite jawhitley's moronic drivel,  subtitles are indeed provided for the entire movie! 

Caution: The movie and the subtitles are packed into lots of rar's. This may require one or two additional clicks and perhaps a few seconds of waiting before you can view your download. While this may present significant cognitive and/or psychological challenges or even traumas to many of you, I recommend that you persevere. It's worth it."
