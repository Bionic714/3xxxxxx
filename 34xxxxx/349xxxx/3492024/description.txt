Plot outline:

A bomb aimer in World War II tries in vain to get a medical discharge to escape the insanity of war. Catch-22 is a satire illustrating how some opportunists successfully exploit the war for there own ends while others are dying fighting it.

Catch-22 has become an expression to describe the opposite to common sense.  A Kafka like situation when bureaucrats interpret the law with an insane logic, destroying the little man the law was intended to protect (in a democracy anyway).

Quote:

In the mess: 
-Those bastards are trying to kill me.
-No one is trying to kill you sweetheart. Eat your desert like a good boy.
-Then why are they shooting at me Milo?
-They are shooting at everyone Yossarian.
-What difference will that make?
-Yossarian, just suppose everyone thought the way you do.
-I'd be a damn fool to think any different.
-You need your head examined.

On the airstrip:
-Anyone who wants to get out of combat isn't really crazy,
-so I can't ground him.
-OK. Let me se if I got this straight.
-In order to be grounded I've got to be crazy
-and I must be crazy to keep flying,
-but if I ask to be grounded I'm no crazy anymore
-and I have to keep flying.
-You've got it. It's CATCH-22.
