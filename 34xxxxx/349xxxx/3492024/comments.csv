,ThaiWhip,2006-06-08T17:13Z,How to burn it without a .cue-file ?
,e-razor,2006-06-08T18:35Z,"Sorry about that ThaiWhip. Try one of the following solutions.

Bin2Iso converter.

www.weethet.nl/english/cdrw_bintoiso.php

Or MagicISO

www.magiciso.com/tutorials/miso-isoconverter.htm

MAC owners, just ""right click"" on the file and choose ""mount it"" (and DVD-player should star automatically if you are really anxious to watch the movie :) or choose ""toast it"" if you want to burn it (that is if you got Toast).

More info.

Thanks a lot for this *great* one!

@ Mac users: I changed the extension from .bin to .cdr, in order to mount it with diskimagemounter.
I don't know why, but when I tried to burn it with Toast, it told me ""CATCH-22.bin is not a valid .bin or .cue file""."
,BambY33,2006-08-28T22:49Z,Cool.... i realy want this one!
,tufekoa1,2006-11-08T01:07Z,"CLASSICS NOT ENOUGH CLASSICS NEVER ENOUGH CLASSICS.
PUMP THEM ALL OUT!!!"
,ungern,2007-10-16T22:21Z,"If anyone still has this torrent, perhaps e-razor (?), could you be so kind to seed it? Thanks!"
,ungern,2007-11-05T21:02Z,Bin2Iso just made a nice 705MB .iso file for me... Did I really want that? Nooooo!  >(
[T],minOdroL,2008-03-06T20:22Z,Great upload!
[T],minOdroL,2008-05-18T12:22Z,"I tried both Bin2Iso converter.

and MagicISO and neither worked, both produced unplayable ISOs. 

Instead I mounted the BIN file with Daemon Tools and then copied the VIDEO_TS folder to the computer HD. Could then watch on comp and burn with Nero."
