,Lister145,2006-06-18T03:32Z,What is the Source? dvd? avi?
,Kaya,2006-06-18T09:03Z,The source? DVD ofc!!!!!!! Othervise it shouldn't be in the dvdr category!
,uraphake,2006-06-18T10:18Z,"This is an interesting flick as far as ""new age"" stuff goes, but I have to say that listening to JZ Knight giving her fortune cookie impersonation (""channeling"") of an alleged 35,000-year-old ""spirit warrior"" named ""Ramtha"" less believable than Hank Azaria doing ""Apu"" for ""The Simpsons."" Utter nonsense. But, yes, it is an interesting film which manages to stretch concepts from quantum physics and force them to ""fit"" dealing with life. But hey, what do I know? It's either that, the Bible, Scientology, a daily dose of Prozac or nothing at all. The choice is yours. I recommend viewing this flick regardless."
,uraphake,2006-06-18T10:36Z,"Oh, it might be worth noting that ""Ramtha"" takes a dim view of ""pirates."" 35,000 years old, or not, it seems copyright knows no bounds: http://www.rickross.com/reference/ramtha/ramtha6.html

,poincare,2006-06-18T22:04Z,"Apparently the producers of this film really do not know anything.  There claims of quantum effects at the real world level are totally falsified.

This film, considered as strictly entertainment, may have some value.  However, as science it is total bunkum, and not even good bunkum."
,uraphake,2006-06-19T13:20Z,"@ poincare -
You are absolutely correct! However, I think it is worthy from the standpoint that people should understand what it is that is being passed off as spiritual guidance these days. If they find themselves as being receptive to such ideas (old ones, at that) then they should do some research before spending money on what is ultimately cosmic claptrap."

,y_cilek,2006-09-02T12:27Z,is it PAL ???
,todu,2007-03-17T21:54Z,"This ""documentary"" is not science. It is new age religious bullshit. Read this review before wasting your bandwidth:

,igl,2007-03-25T10:26Z,"thats bs, dont seed"
,HueMann,2007-07-28T16:44Z,"Wow! After reading the wiki I couldn't dare to think of downloading this film and coming to my own conclusions! You are right Todu! Read the Wiki and trust what it says and while you're at it TRUST ALL the mainstream media outlets like FOX for all we need to know about the world, politics and the universe.

DO NOT THINK FOR YOURSELF!!!
You may awaken in a world that you do not understand."
,wetlight,2008-04-13T01:21Z,"I totally agree with HueMann!! Camon guys, make up your own minds. Watch it and decide for yourself. It has been a pattern that most of the discoveries of our crazy world has been met with reluctancy by the so called authority on knowledge. Let's not limit ourselves on the possibilities to the answers to what we don't know yet!!! 
Seed!!!"
,The3rdiight,2009-06-07T08:30Z,"Yes a lot of exaggerations, funded primarily by a cult,  a few ""experts"" that have an agenda and there are things I don't agree with. But you know what? The world was thought to be flat as fact for thousands of years. It's a kind of thinking that's been a weed in my brain since I was ten. 
If you're completely comfortable with your ""reality""; your born, you live, you die, your dirt"" or ""god is my Shepard, I shall not want""etc., then this video would probably disturb your ideals and you'll be all like the other butt-hurt fags that commented negatively here.

The main point I grasped from this video is THINK!. And I actually believe  that was one of the last messages given in this video.

I also recommend The Elegant Universe in conjunction with this.

Also even though Einstein was largely believed to be isolated and confined in his ideals with his theories later in his life I though one quote that  defined this video for me; ""The most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious. It is the source of all true art and all science. He to whom this emotion is a stranger, who can no longer pause to wonder and stand rapt in awe, is as good as dead: His eyes are closed."""
