,username_,2006-09-26T10:02Z,"I tried burning this with Nero 6 by selecting DVD video files in Nero Express.

I also tried making it into an image (.nrg), to mount in deamon tools, using the same method. 

I put the files from VIDEO_TS (.BUP, .IFO, .VOB etc) in the file called VIDEO_TS in Nero. 

Is this not the way to do it? The file is ""damaged"" or ""not compatible with Windows"" when i try to watch it.

What to do? I really wanted to watch this."
,mrdunworthy,2006-10-23T02:00Z,"I'm no wizard on Nero (running version 5), but there's menu-item: ""Burn Image"", with which you should be able to burn the downloaded ISO-file directly. Not having to go daemon. Not entirely sure about this, but may be worth a shot. Great upload btw!"
,username_,2006-10-23T11:29Z,"Thank you for answering. I managed to solve it in Nero 7. 

Great, great, great upload! Thank you so much!"
