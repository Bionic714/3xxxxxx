"Your Buddha Nature" contains contains some REALLY great lectures by Jack Kornfield who has studied buddhistic thought and practice 
during his life as a monk, but also as a psychologist (Ph.D) I have got quite many gigabytes with material dealing with psychology, 
philosopy, religion, science and spirituality but this is really something special. I've seeded some other stuff by Kornfield before and 
they have been very apreciated. In every lecture he illustrates stuff with some tales or legends which is great because he is really a 
good storyteller. This torrent is complete with all 12 lectures in really good soundquality. Enjoy and reseed!
