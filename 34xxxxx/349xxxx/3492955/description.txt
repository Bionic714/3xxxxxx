The Mach 2 'Thud' first flew in 1955 and was intended as a tactical nuclear bomber. It excelled
however in the all-weather strike role during the Vietnam conflict, where the type was used
intensively to protect the bombers from the SAM threat. The F-105D was the standard single-seat
model used by the USAF in many varied strike roles through out its service. The 354TFS/355TFW 
were based at Takhli RTAB (Thailand) from early on in the Vietnam War.
