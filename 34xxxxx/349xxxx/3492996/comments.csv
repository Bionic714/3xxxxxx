,black curtian,2006-11-09T03:24Z,"kyle awsome, i here ya due, some of thes idiots upload some of the dumbest shit. i saw a torrent for media player 11 the otherday... what the fuck good is that, if you cant dwnld it from MS get a legit copy of windows. there's all kinds of FREE software in these torrents, maybe some people like to take much longer to dwnld a file than you have too. i think others just upload or dwnld to they can feel like they did something"
