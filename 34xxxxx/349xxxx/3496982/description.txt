Michel Huygen (Neuronium) was one of the early New Age innovators whose name is usually passed over in favor of NA masters like Klaus Schulze, Edgar Froese (Tangerine Dream), Vangelis and Jean-Michel Jarre.

In this compact disc, Michel Huygen has selected thirteen pieces from former albums by him. The viewpoint from which he has done so is related to the title of the release. It consists in themes sharing the common characteristic that they can be used as ambient music during a pleasant meal, like for instance during a private dinner requiring a romantic environment. The music happens to be ideal for such an objective, since it all is of a romantic style, with cosmic elements that enhance its ethereal, magical character. The compositions included in this CD are: "Azulete", "Folie d'amour", "Numerica", "Deep illness of love", "Tesoros", "Sentimiento ilimitado", "Macrocosmos", "Ternura", "El Peso de la amistad", "Venezia", "Impossible love", "Promenade" and "En ninguna parte".
