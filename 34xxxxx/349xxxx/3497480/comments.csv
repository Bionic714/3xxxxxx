[T],stevekasian,2006-06-24T12:39Z,"WinnieXL:
Any idea if this is V1.01 or 1.02 upgrade? Cuz the upgrade to 1.02 alters some .bgls, also adding a .bgl to  '/scenery' if U R running 1.01 on a pirate serial.
Tnx.

1. Uninstall FlyTampa Seattle
2. Reinstall FlyTampa Seattle v1.0 and add to scenery library. Do not install the update 1.1.
3. Use this update below to update the textures, scenery, and afcad

Worked for me, anyway."
