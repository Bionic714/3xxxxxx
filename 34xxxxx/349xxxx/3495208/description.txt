Three teenage guys try to figure out what they're supposed to be doing with their
lives in this drama from Uruguay that puts the emphasis on character over narrative.
Javi has landed a job driving a sound truck that plays the same radio spot for pasta 
all day long, while his buddy Leche, who is supposed to be studying for his exams,
instead finds himself having sexual fantasies about his tutor, and Seba is waylaid 
by a handful of small-time dope dealers when all he wants to do is go home and watch
the porno movie he's just rented.
