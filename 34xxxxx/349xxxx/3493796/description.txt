Hi, i finaly got all the simpsons episodes and want to make them all to DVD's...The quality is pretty normal, i don't know to explain it :P
Hope you like it, if not, maybe you could give me some feedback :)

I made season 1-3 with Ulead Movie Factory 5...But for 4 and up to 16 (soon 17) it's made with Ulead Movie Factory 4 and have some diferent looking menus.
Season 1-3 are dvd rips and are "default" compressed with the Movie Factory. 4 and up is divx and have the "normal" divx quality
I have splitted season 2 and 3 up in three dvd's for at better quality :)

It's in english all of it, and theres no subtitles at all...



I am not trying to take credit from [RL] who is the man that made this posible, by sharing all the episodes for me/us to dl...BIG THANKS FROM ME!!!


NEW: I have made this e-mail so you can make notice me if there is "need for seed" on some of the torrents :)
