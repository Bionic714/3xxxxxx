Nothing about this project is remotely professional (or even amateur) and it would be an insult to many young talents even if they'd call this a student film.

Whoever wrote the comment above this one is clearly involved in the project and should never be allowed to write about films again as he is also definitely blind as well as deaf.   

...we might as well all put our own home videos on the IMDb and that's really not the idea."
