British architect Callum Coats edited and translated this book from Viktor Schauberger's works with the full title The fertile earth - Nature's energies in agriculture, soil fertilisation and forestry (2000). Schauberger, a famous austrian natural philosopher, pioneered many ways of more natural agriculture which is becoming more and more popular since other ways have destroyed nature completely. For Schauberger Earth is like a living being and must be treated accordingly, if injured it must be healed in a hollistic manner. 210 pages, some pictures.

From the backcover:
How does Nature work? When one looks closely at the enormously complex web of life, it is impossible not to be caught by the wonder of how all living things - yes, including rocks and crystals - are interconnected. Just as there is thought behind action, so there is energy behind matter. Schauberger is able to demonstrate how Nature works because he has been able to observe and describe how its energies manifest and produce the material world. This book contains Schauberger's writings on trees, biodynamic agriculture and subtle energies in nature. It answers questions like why are so many species of plant and animal disappearing?
As industrial civilisation lurches towards ecological meltdown, Schauberger's present ideas and discoveries willl be closely examined by all who seek to find a way for humanity to live in harmony, rather than conflich, with Nature.
