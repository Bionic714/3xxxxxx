Can Atilla - Electronics & drumming
Murat Yucil - Electric & classic guitars 

This CD from 2003 features 64 minutes of New Age Music recorded 
live at the Ankara International Music Festival in May of 2002. Attilla's 
electronics and drumming are accompanied by Murat Yucel on electric 
and classic guitars. 

Of Turkish ancestry, Can Atilla explores New Age electronic (EM) 
territory in the footsteps of Tangerine Dream and Jean Michel Jarre, 
flavoring those influences with his own uniquely lively sensibilities.

Dense keyboards belt out rapidly structured riffs with a frenetic 
passion, immediately drenching the audience with melodies that surge 
and cascade full of vigor and stamina. Sequencing provides lavish, 
growling underlayers for the emphatic keyboards. A variety of clever 
electronic effects flavor the music with astral airs.

Powerful percussion swiftly propels the music to epic proportions, 
adding larger-than-life rhythms that explode with authority. A sense of 
compelling grandeur is achieved, a majesty that expands with each 
passing minute.

Fiery guitar-work embellishes the already hyperactive music, injecting 
ardent fury and cosmic demeanor.

Possessing strong Tangerine Dream influences, Atilla forces an 
escalation of dazzle from those roots, generating tuneage that is huge 
and impressively masterful. His audience reels before the sheer power 
of his music, dazed by its commanding presence and entranced by its 
engaging melodies.
