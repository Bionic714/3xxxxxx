Newly arrived psychiatric administrator Dr. Richard Thorndyke (Mel Brooks) finds some bizarre shenanigans occurring at the Psychoneurotic Institute for the Very, Very Nervous. But when he's framed for murder, Dr. Thorndyke must confront his own neurotic demons, a raging case of "high anxiety," in order to clear his name. Contains a handful of set pieces that satirize such Alfred Hitchcock classics as The Birds, Psycho and Vertigo.
