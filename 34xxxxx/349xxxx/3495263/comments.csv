one can only hope the population wakes up before its too late. "
,Temptation,2006-06-25T07:08Z,"I agree what you said about this documentary.  This was one of the best anti-Bush documentaries I've seen that factually lays out the entire genocidal Neo-Con plan of launching aggressive, unprovoked wars on one Middle-Eastern country after another and killing thousands and thousands of innocent Muslims and Arabs all for the purpose of securing the oil-supplies in the Middle-East and to ensure American and Israeli dominance of the Middle-East and ensure America remains the sole super- power forever.  That was the real reason for the war in Iraq and not all that nonsensical propaganda that Americans bought hook, line and sinker about Iraq suddenly being such an imminent threat that left only war as the only option.
