,fitzchiv,2006-07-24T23:42Z,Yo what you guys playing these with? for some reason none of my media players will deal with them! even VLC
,TehUberGeeK,2006-08-08T20:33Z,6x11 and 6x12 are to wide. VLC can make it look normal by going Aspect-ratio>16:9 but if I burn this it'll look funny on the dvd player. :(
