The Sopranos - Season 6 - HDTV - XviD - LOL (Mostly)

No bullshit fakes! (For all 12 episodes)


Well, I started posting from 06x02 because of the rampant fakes.
I only missed posting 06x07 because I was in the hospital having surgery.
So, here we are at the end of this season (or middle depending on who you ask) and here are all 12 episodes.
I have posted episode 12 by itself here:

I will also be posting a torrent for the HR.HDTV episodes so be on the lookout for those.

See you in January when the 8 bonus season 6 episodes begin!
