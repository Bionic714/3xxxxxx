,r0bb1n,2006-11-03T07:54Z,"i realy hope you will upload the new mod 2: knights of the nine divine. it looks like an awesome mod to me but i am not realy glad with paying $9,99 for it. so upload that one 2!!!"
,hypnomoosebeaver,2008-01-20T17:24Z,"you must activate the relevant datafiles in the oblivion load up to have the mods work, simply placing the files in the correct location wont make them work incidentally."
,jordman2,2008-04-01T08:09Z,"And when you have copied the files to oblivion/data??? What should I do to make them ""Work"""
,danieljackson,2008-05-19T03:58Z,"After you have placed the files where they need to be before you start the game when the splash screen comes up there is a tab that says data files click it and inside you will find some boxes make sure all of them are clicked and then your game should work perfectly fine, Its called google for a reason guys jeez and if you retards had ever played the original morrowind then you would already know this information"
