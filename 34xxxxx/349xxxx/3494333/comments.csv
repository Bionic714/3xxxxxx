it's interesting how righteously intolerant some people can be of others who might actually appreciate these titles. anybody dissing or calling for the removal of other stuff being offered here? 

i don't always agree with man-made ""religion"" per se; but i think there's more to life than just the physical since science has begrudgingly admitted that there are higher and lower non-physical dimensions we can't measure or understand.

i do like when people try to be and do good cuz it benefits not only them but the rest of us; society is just a little bit better. an atheist wrote somewhere that true religion and spiritual practice has little to do with war and hatred; it's human greed, pure and simple; that and human arrogance; we all got plenty to go around. 

Religion is basically any practice and belief that someone follows--spiritual or non-spiritual. you don't have to pray spiritually to pray.

agreeing to disagree and respecting each other's opinions is probably a good idea. i try to do so, flawed as i am.

,tekproxy,2008-03-18T18:55Z,"Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee. -- Genesis 3:16

And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in the transgression. Notwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing.--1 Timothy 2:14-15

And the LORD sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people; and much people of Israel died.--Numbers 21:6

,DupeD,2008-05-01T00:48Z,"Thou shalt not steal. Exodus 20.

I agree, but what is stealing?

According to the KJV (King James Version) Dictionary found at:
http://av1611.com/kjbp/kjv-dictionary/steal.html

STEAL, v.t. pret. stole; pp. stolen, stole. G. L, to take, to lift.

1. To take and carry away feloniously, as the personal goods of another. To constitute stealing or theft, the taking must be felonious, that is, with an intent to take what belongs to another, and without his consent.

Let him that stole, steal no more. Ephesians 4.

According to the Webster's Revised Unabridged Dictionary, © 1996, 1998 MICRA, Inc.

The definition of Felonious:

Fe*lo""ni*ous\, a. Having the quality of felony; malignant; malicious; villainous; traitorous; perfidious; in a legal sense, done with intent to commit a crime; as, felonious homicide. 

http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/felonious

Therefore one could conclude that when downloading a file such as a torrent or otherwise as no act of felony has occurred, no personal goods of another have been carried away and the file remains in the possession of the owner then no act of theft has transpired.  File sharing is completely legal and furthermore a widely accepted practice here in Canada.  Nothing could be further than theft.  On the contrary, I applaud Christian uploaders for sharing the gospel with one another and especially those who still need to be saved. Bravo!"

,pilatuspilot,2008-05-25T18:00Z,"I just want to add a footnote for consideration in this discussion on ""stealing.""
Granted ""stealing"" is taking the ""property"" of an other as one's own without recupense (sp?) or it being donated (gifted) by the ""property"" owner.
The question becomes what denotes ""property?""
Can air be property? Of course not, most would reason.
Can land? Of course, most european-based and asian thought would reason, both other thought patterns say no. One can't own land because it is not man's to give. There is even a statement by ""God"" in Torah that says it is not man's but 'His'.
To this topic, can one own ideas? Most european-based folk would say yes. Thus you have intellectual-property laws. But others say no. One cannot own intellect or the fruits thereof. So books, music, any""thing"" that is an idea cannot be owned. However, were one to use an idea to make a physical thing, like a car, the car is property but the idea of the car is not.
A physical book, in this vein, can be owned but the ideas of the book cannot. And so now we are have electronically transferred images of a book or music. Can they be property, can one own them?
Most folk I've discussed this with have an agenda based on desire, greed and economics and so their input is checked.
And those who are kleptomaniacs have a checked input as well, as they take what ever they want.
But if one reasons what is duly ownable and what is not the discussion becomes interesting."
,rascus35,2008-06-20T18:46Z,"Athiests....you are somewhat like us, you claim there is no evidence in god because you are too ignorent to look, while there actually is no proof to even tempt us to glance at your way of looking at things. On anouther subject, I believe Christ loves us pirates, was it not he himself who fed the crowd by multiplying the fish and bread? Was that not technically other individual's property?

,Cheehwawa,2008-10-31T22:12Z,"Nobody bashes the Buddhists because Buddhism is a very different religion from the Abrahamic ones. Buddhism asks literally nothing of you; it tells you to live a good and normal life, you do not have to believe in any god or goddess (Buddha did not claim to be divine as Jesus did), and it has very few guidelines... which are not ""required"" to reach nirvana as a Christian has to follow commandments and rules (Such as stoning gays and people who goto work on Sundays? Nahh.... that wento outta style a long time ago.... unless Palin can bring it back! Hah.) Buddhism's ""hell"" is the endless cycle of life-death-rebirth called reincarnation that we can only break out of by being a human with free-will (something we DO NOT HAVE according to the bible... if God is all-knowing and timeless, he knows every possible outcome in our lives, past, present and future, so he controls history and has since the beginning, he does not need to ""test"" us if he already knows what score we will get!)

That said, I do not like religion... in the religious sense. I take all religions as they are to me; stories told by people who lived a LONG time ago with VERY LITTLE understanding of the world around them. They needed a way of spreading laws and a way of teaching moral guidelines to their subjects... and they had to make it catchy. So they told stories, and eventually wrote books.

There is literally NO truth behind any religion (taken literally) and absolutely no proof for God, Allah, Yahweh, whatever you want to call him, just as there is no proof for Zeus, Ra, Anubis, etc. We are ALL atheists... some of us just go one God further. Good quote by a good man IMO.

I will be downloading this torrent, though, not because I believe in religion... but because it interests me. I really do like the stories from all mythologies, christianity included, so I will look into this because I am writing a novel that deals with the.... origins.... of the human understanding of ""the divine,""circa 9600 BCE around the time that Atlantis supposedly sunk.

Its a concept that I take to be very different than the divine beings immortalized in religious texts."

When we want your bible bullshit we will ask for it by name, not by searching for terms which are clearly unrelated to it. WHAT YOU ARE DOING IS CALLED ""SPAM"", JACKASS!  look it up in your ten commandments under the search phrase ""bearing false witness"" --as in ""pretending to be something that you are not!"" I do not know how you manage to pop up in so many of my searches, but i'm pretty sure that i was not looking for anything related to your book of lies (you call it the bible) i did not enter any words related to ""bible"" ""christian"" ""jesus"" ""fairy tale"" or even ""end of the world"" in my search query. Yet here you are, wasting my time. And for the moron who speaks of ""freedom"" in the comments, when do i get the freedom not to be harassed by idiots? Like I said, you are wasting my time! Your spam gets in the way of legitamete data. It is hard enough for me to find old episodes of ""the Odd Couple"" without having to wade through a list of this crap."

[T],IndianChristian,2009-03-08T09:40Z,"Thanks for the upload. 
Keep up the good work in the lord ignoring the devils who are all around you, trying to stop you from doing the work which will send hundreds to heaven. It reminds me of the people who were seething with rage and taunting Jesus during his crucifixion. The same scene is being replayed over here again."
,warangal,2009-03-28T18:22Z,"hey can you provide the DVD versions for rest of the bible series please need Orginal DVD format for all the remaining movies like Joseph on nazerth,Judas,Magdalene Mary,Esther,Thomas,Genesis etc

,djkfdjf,2009-04-19T09:44Z,"Great work!

What about uploading the best miniseries of all time: A.D. (anno domini) the original version is around 10 hours, Peter and Paul are the main characters in this epic movie.

,notenough,2009-06-06T07:21Z,"Bah! As we know from Southpark, only Mormons go to heaven. This torrent annoys me for no other reason than it's keyword spamming causing it to show up when it's the last thing on earth (or elsewhere for that matter) that I would ever want to see.

As for the content... I don't care. I want to see torrents for hindu's, christians, jews, muslims, satanists, everyone and everything. I just don't want them to show up while I'm trying to find episodes of ""In Search Of"" with Leonard Nimoy.

Just because I don't plan to download it doesn't mean it's not important to me that it's available for others. This world would suck if only one opinion decided everything.

,Esmad3,2009-06-08T14:24Z,"@ john1one: I made a post at 2008-12-09 20:31 CET and nothing bad has happened. To me I mean, bad things happen all the time, especially in the countrys that are the most religious (but I guess you would justify that by them having the wrong religion) since they are usually the poorest. I myself live in Scandinavia where only 1 in 5 believe in god and we actually have it pretty good here. I guess I can't totally rule out divine intervention, we certainly seem blessed (e.g.: Denmark voted happiest country on earth 3 times in a row), and I don't claim to know all the mysteries of the universe like you christians do, but if that is the case I think that it only goes to prove that god is realy this cool charachter who doesn't care if you worship him as long as you lead a good life and play nice with others. Oh btw., just because you probably are some kind of conservative (American?), we're socialists to. I myself pay 42% in taxes and loves it. Some pay above 50% and we smile all day."
,UR-Djavu,2009-06-15T14:25Z,"Anti-Popes were not against the Popes, they wanted to become Popes themselves. The Roman Catholic church uses the term Anti-Popes to describe those men who wanted to wear the title of Pope - so the Anti-Christ is better translated as the one who wishes to take the place of Christ himself on earth - now ask any catholic person this next question: Who here on earth is the sole representative of Christ ? The answer will always be the Pope. He himself claims that he is Christs main man..."

,mickymartin,2010-11-28T19:22Z,"Hey Bucky Thank you so much for sharing these movies , i come from a country (India) where it's almost impossible to find this amazing collection, Once again Hat's off to you :) .

I read lot of sense less comments here but you don't worry about them they know nothing about the religion and also about the History on how the system works in this world so please carry on the Good work.

Now here it is for all those people who have been writing stupid comments, Learn about Christianity and read the Bible if you have any doubts Christianity is all about sharing the love and word of GOD which changes as per the time Torrents are a excellent way of sharing the word of God in this present time, and audio video helps us or perhaps the human beings to understand anything thing rather than cramming it from a book, i am for sure sharing it with the kids in Sunday school and as much as i can.  And for those stupid dickheads who do not even know about the history PLZ read about the BARTER SYSTEM it was a system which was practiced much before the money of perhaps the currency was introduced people exchanged good based on their skills and inheritance example if i had a extra pair of clothes and someone had a extra pair of shoes we would exchange it it was kind of a tradition that time. The capitalists or the policy makers fucked every thing up they are still dominating it by making you think what they want you think P2p sharing is not wrong its just about sharing not STEALING. SO BETTER ENHANCE YOUR KNOWLEDGE BEFORE MAKING THESE STUPID COMMENTS. Hope you got it what m trying to say here so Enjoy and Seed, LOL :)"
,mickymartin,2010-11-28T19:28Z,And yes i for got m doing a research on religion with the guidance of the Holy Spirit and can screw up every religion here be it HINDUS< MUSLIMS< SIKHS< BUDDHISTS or any other religion in this world m a international development worker by profession but i don't want to do it here if u wanna argue u r welcome CHEERS !!!
