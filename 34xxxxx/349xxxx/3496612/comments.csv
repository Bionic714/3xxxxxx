Er det ISO???"
,arnold1965,2006-06-28T15:35Z,does your PS2 need to have a chip inside to play the games you download and burn???
,crewmex,2006-07-02T00:20Z,yes you need a chip to play burn games
,misswent,2006-07-05T14:46Z,"no you don't need a chip, you need a swap magic cd or dvd, depending in what format the game is, break off the cover of the cd tray and use a slide tool to remove the swap disc and insert the game disc without the console knowing it. It sounds hard but I'm a girl and I've been doing it for a couple of years now.. so you should be able to do it as well"
,froid_san,2008-09-18T16:31Z,anybody willing to seed this again?
,Pedro-100,2010-01-19T04:04Z,"I'm on 99%, and its not downloading anymore, please, can someone seed?"
,Pedro-100,2010-01-23T23:13Z,"This is probably corrupt, i downloaded using LimeWire and using uTorrent, on both cases the games stops on 99,8%!!! "
