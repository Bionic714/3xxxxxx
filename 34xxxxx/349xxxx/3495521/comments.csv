,Mr_Ecks,2006-06-15T12:20Z,But now I'm complaining... How about seeding your own torrent. It was uped not 12 hours ago. You have to seed for a few days. Posting a torrent is a comittment.

I don't have a pic of the album.  This is a rip from a CD that someone associated with the band mailed to me before it came out.  The sound is the same as the retail version, I believe."
