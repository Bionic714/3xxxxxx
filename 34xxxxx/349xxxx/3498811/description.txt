Hey everyone, this is my latest, all these tracks are from my new vinyls and probably will be pretty big, so have a good listen and appreciate them before ministry flogs the shit
out of them. Hopefully you will all enjoy this mix, i feel it is my best and most consistent to date. Remember to tell me what you think and make any suggestions to my email.
