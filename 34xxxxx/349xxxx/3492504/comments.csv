,mrmeskalin,2006-06-04T23:21Z,Moning 2 ....... Your a bit of a pecker
,TL34EVER,2006-06-04T23:44Z,"No God = No Heaven = No Hope

I like having God more."
,SQRK,2006-06-05T03:11Z,No God=No Hope=Scare Tactics. Go suck your mothers tit TL34EVER!!!!!
,mrmeskalin,2006-06-05T08:43Z,"SQRK - is obviously a good little slave who is very much brainwashed ! Ready to accept most beliefs society push's upon, to mould him into an obedient citizen. Heck, SQRK would probably join the military he's that much of a pecker."
,mrmeskalin,2006-06-05T08:50Z,"Unfortunatly there is alot of misrepresentation of God in the world today, I do not believe that one should follow a faith (or anything) blindly without serious questioning issues and/or looking at other viewpoints of the same subject. I do believe in a God, I feel sorry for the people who are so simple minded that they have to be awfull to other people who have belief in a God. For at the end of day it is they who are in a worse position that the rest of us, who have belief and understanding. Question this..... the UK Arch Bishop is a Druid of the highest degree ...... Does'nt quite fit with christianity .... but hey what do I know.. he represents the Christian faith in the UK.... Not me !"
,SQRK,2006-06-05T12:26Z,Looks like mrmeskalin has got a thing for peckers. :-0 -:
,visible_noise,2006-06-05T12:51Z,"I agreed with mrmeskalin up until he (i'm assuming you're a he) said ""For at the end of day it is they who are in a worse position that the rest of us, who have belief and understanding."" I am an aethist, and I feel I understand the world enough. Everyone has the right to choose religion, or not. ""We"" are in no worse position than you just because we ""lack belief and understanding."" Maybe we lack your belief and understanding as a Christian, but that doesn't mean we're wrong or in a worse position, or ""worse"" than you. I have my own belief and understanding as an aethist, and it's as damn valid as anyone elses. "
,Darndare,2006-06-05T19:16Z,"mrmeskalin: Yoy feel ""sorry for the people who are so simple minded that they have to be awfull to other people who have belief in a God.""
And in the next sentence you condem everyone who doesnÂ´t believe? Isn't that an Oxymoron?"
,mrmeskalin,2006-06-07T00:39Z,"No, I was'nt condemning people who dont believe in God ! Not at all, I was condemning the people who mock those who have a belief or opinion, whatever that may be... even athiest like Visible Noise !

,Barking Spider,2006-06-29T10:06Z,"Sure there's a god.  

It's me...

and it's you..

and it's this computer desk...

and the sky, the stars...."
