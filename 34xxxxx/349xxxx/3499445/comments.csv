,sinsliveforever,2006-06-29T20:45Z,"why would bitcomet be a ""cheating"" clieant?

,sinsliveforever,2006-07-01T19:35Z,"to answer ""reatard69""Â´s  question ; ""To sinsliveforever: This is NOT a support forum for your computer problems...""
 No your right , at least that TPB  is not my private little support forum. But when problems occur that slows/destroys your software on your computer,because a bad torrent. Then you(or at least I) want to alert the others that have downloaded this torrent !
 I take full  responsibility for all the mishaps , but  i have been busy and had little time to check the program out properly ( the sony one, that is)  and there was no root-kit..... So i installed this torrent again and guess what; Its the torrent/patch that fucks up your computer!  And further more you are the little wanker that wantÂ´s people to change there torrent clients !  For what ever reason you my have for it,  I say take your controlling personality (probably because you have no controll over your own life) and piss off! "
,Spetsnaz420,2007-01-23T00:55Z,"Hey how about someone seed this for a couple of minutes...?

Such a small file is seeded so easily"
,Spetsnaz420,2007-01-23T01:55Z,or at least delete a dead torrent...damn piratebay reporting false seeders >
