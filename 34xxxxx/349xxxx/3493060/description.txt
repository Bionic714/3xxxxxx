imdb says:

Universal Groove is a step into the underground party scene, through the eyes of a once party strong addict. A wonderful culmination of sights, sounds and narrative are used to tell the story of Jim, a director struggling to understand the human connections that exist in a crowd of strangers... Over the course of one night Jim meets and connects with people in different walks of life, all while discovering the meaning of being part of the human tribe.
