,luigibros,2006-08-06T02:07Z,do i burn this to a dvd-r or a cd-r?
,d3liriumz,2006-08-30T12:16Z,"To onlyforward (and some more rookies): Since the XBOX runs with a DVD player u have to burn everything on DVD's. U also have to use the DVD+R and not the DVD-R. Unless u dont have a Hard Drive on ur Xbox, then u can just transfer the game files or movis directly to the HD."
,r4t,2006-09-01T05:52Z,"hey d3liriumz  (GENIUS and STILL ROOKIE) It really looks  like you don't know much about xbox heh,  older xbox's would ONLY read dvd-r like the thompson drive, but with the newer dvd drives it reads both dvd+R and dvd -R but also reads cdr's in both cases old and new.  

I didn't download the game yet but as a helpfull hint if you want you can burn iso's with dvd decrypter too which does the trick i've tried it wiht a backup game i've used, the game is the guy game which i used a double layer cd which is a dvd+r."
,Dkmaster,2006-09-02T11:04Z,Thx Vodkaeye ! Works perfekt ^^
,sorkki,2006-10-08T14:20Z,"nice of you to give the noobs some advice r4t, but you're wrong. some older xboxes only read DVD+r and refused to read DVD-r. Xboxes with the thompson drive sometimes reads only DVD+r, but actually most of them (as most other xboxes) reads both DVD+r and -r, but the risk of getting dirty disc error is higher with DVD-r discs in most drives.

,cherrypie556,2006-10-10T14:34Z,"Novice here and totally stuck. How do i burn this. Tried nero, dvd decryptor and magic iso and nothing works. tried using both dvd+r and cd-r and neither work. cd-r to small and dvd+ just not accepted. HELP (and be nice )"
,Reinclaw,2006-11-01T19:55Z,just use alcohol 120%. it'll ask you if you want to use a dvd to burn to. I always use dvd-r. i never have a problem with burning iso's smaller than 700mb on dvds.
,QWIKAG,2006-11-05T17:52Z,"Game works well. 

Thanks vodkaeye. your iso's have worked well for me. Had plenty of hours of fun out of Monopoly 

Best way to install on Xbox is to use ""XIT"", 

""Xbox Iso Transfer"" it takes the whole iso file and places it straight onto your xbox hard drive as if you had taken it direct from the disc. 

Your Xbox needs to be chipped and you need to know the ftp password usually User:xbox PW:xbox

You may need to stuff around with folder names, I had to but then I reset my zboz and it worked perfect."
,rewstama,2006-11-30T22:44Z,"Avalaunch/Qwix is faster than XIT.

But, yea, best way is to FTP the game to HD and not worry about DVD+/-R and fiddly burning programs.
