Possibly the worst movie I have ever seen, and a waste of bandwidth.
The plot was simply terrible, the names of the character seem to be some kind of bad joke. And the movie fails to have a point, apart from buckaroo being the coolest person in the world for some reason... Highly unbeleivable movie even for a sci-fi.

Think twice before download, i register just to warn you how bad this movie is..."
