,zapador,2006-07-01T18:39Z,"Seems that I'm still the only one seeding, or it might just be that it doesn't work very well.

,zapador,2006-07-02T04:05Z,"I'm seeding as much as my connection can handle :o)
And that's 40 Mbit/s."
,zapador,2006-07-02T04:08Z,"BTW sikazz... Downloading more date than the actual file(s) is common.
It is most often - if not always - caused by some of the downloaded data being corrupted which resulsts in that data being downloaded twice. Hence the extra amound of date being transferred :o)"
