,KimK,2006-06-20T23:13Z,"Sorry, I didnt know how else to explain it. This is a DVD-rip. It was recorded on a DVD when they showed the movie on German television some time ago."
,KimK,2006-06-20T23:16Z,"SORRY, again if you mean the first source, It is television. "
,nura,2006-06-21T04:05Z,"if you watch a girl through a key hole and record it on high def video, it still will be a recording through a key hole..  some logic please!"
,nanaem,2006-06-21T07:26Z,"The sound wasnt very good, kinda rustling. But great upload anyways KimK, love this older TV stuff... "
,KimK,2006-06-21T09:21Z,"Nura, in that case this is a high quality TV-rip, with a strange, but endureable sound. "

,KimK,2006-06-23T16:02Z,"yeah,nes663a, if youÂ´re talking about the 2003 series, the pilot was filmed, but it never aired."

,frodason1987,2006-11-11T16:10Z,"How do you view this file? Divx tells me that the file contains multiple audio tracks, and is unable to play it.
Do I need another codec?"
,POiSON-X,2007-07-02T21:05Z,"since the pilot of young macgyver was filmed but
not aired is it impossible to get it then?"
,jsz,2007-07-11T17:24Z,Nice upload! Thanks.
,snashuk,2007-07-24T16:43Z,I somebody actually going to bother to seed it????????????
,XXXmeXXX,2007-11-27T10:35Z,"Can somebody upload the DVD? 
I want it whit norwegian text!  :P"
,CaptainMidnight,2007-12-25T05:42Z,"Very good video quality, so-so sound, some German credits, but great for a TV rip. And no station watermark. Until somebody provides a rip from the DVD box set, this will do fine."
,joker smoker,2008-02-17T15:33Z,Seed please.
