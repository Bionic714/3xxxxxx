Well if you must, you could start with: http://www.publiceye.org/conspire/Post911/demnowfaq.html"
,tomtomx,2006-06-07T23:31Z,"On the other hand. If you're a true conspiracy freak, you could always claim that every fact that proves you wrong are made by people that per definition is in on the plot..."
,PiratBosse,2006-06-08T05:47Z,"I _am_ a conspiracy freak. In that respect that I'm intrigued by the way the conspricacy theoretics can twist it so it actually sounds like it's true. Chek out ""The Mother of all Conspiracy"", The Perl Harbor attack...
Of course I don't believe that 9/11 was a government attack, but you have to admit that Loose Change surely make it look so."
,PiratBosse,2006-06-09T11:55Z,"Yeah, seen it. Beat the crap out of Loose Changes conspiracy theory. Defenitly something to see after seeing Loose Change video."
,pelgrim108,2006-06-09T17:43Z,"I visited screwloosechange and found that its ""debunking"" was nothing more than mindless disinfo. They take the 911comission report for truth. They ""debunk"" loosechange by comparing it to the report. For instance the report says that suspicious putoptions on the airlines involved have actually occurred but were not suspicious because the could not be linked with Al Qaida. 

Do you agree with such wisdom?"
,PiratBosse,2006-06-10T06:34Z,"Damn... So now I've got a Screw the Screw Loose Change too..
Were and how should one look to find the real truth...?"
,pelgrim108,2006-06-10T14:29Z,"@ piratbosse
Loose Change is a possibily to look at ALL the facts for a start, and then start using your common sense.
Stop calling names and give some real arguments instead. Or give us the link to the film that convincingly debunks Loose Change or the findings of hte 911truth movement or the scolars for 911truth."
,PiratBosse,2006-06-12T13:15Z,"I'm not calling any names. I'm from Sweden and was hardly awared about any conspiracy when I saw Loose Change. It's very well made, and made me convinced. Almost. Then I searched for more info and got Screw Loose Change. And now I've got a Screw Screw Loose Change.
Sorry, right now I don't know what to think."
