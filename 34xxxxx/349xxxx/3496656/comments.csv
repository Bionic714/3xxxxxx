,Torr3nt,2006-06-20T10:15Z,Download it from microsoft's server insteed. http://www.microsoft.com/windowsvista/getready/preview.mspx And go down a bit
,Torr3nt,2006-06-21T00:35Z,Why... That was easy to me... And if you download there u can activate it...
,jock007,2006-06-21T06:35Z,there is no point if you have an asus sli mobo or any sli mobo as it does not work and they have not updated it as yet i have been trying with the may version for weeks.
,skowfritt,2006-06-21T23:26Z,"SLReArmWindows does work. After you right-click and run as administrator the welcome screen says ""this machine is unlicensed"". After you reboot it will say that you have 14 days again."
,wjfowler74,2006-06-23T04:37Z,"Thanks Torr3nt, why hack it when MS will give you a valid key just for your use."
,jroc74,2006-06-25T07:44Z,"why install an OS u cant keep?? uh...cuz its beta...? why keep a beta OS as ur main system??

and exactly...why the activate hacks when u can activate online using the keys from M$.."
,jroc74,2006-06-25T07:47Z,one more thing: u can download them off torrents and still activate using the keys from MS. u dont necessarily have to download it from MS. They have constant connection problems. They probably luv torrents right about now lol
,kazopu,2006-07-14T23:49Z,The problem is....MS has closed the download...no more people can download Vista or get Keys... so how do I get around the activation?
,toca3,2006-10-04T19:28Z,Is this beeing seeded?
,darth71,2006-10-27T04:41Z,I will seed again if you want...but there is Rc1 and RC2 now which are better....And MS will give you a free key to use untill next year when it is released to the public.
