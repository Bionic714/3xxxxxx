,voyeurman,2006-08-10T10:13Z,Does it comes with ENGLISH subtitle? 
,pialightwave,2007-10-18T07:41Z,"The SPOKEN language on this movie file is Spanish, I don't think it has subtitles. Manderlay is originally in English, it has an American cast.

DON'T DL IF YOU DON'T KNOW SPANISH.

Let me know if I'm missing something  cause I honestly find any English in this file!

,pialightwave,2007-10-18T07:44Z,"CORRECTION:

I honestly *CAN'T* find any English in this file."

As the info says it has only spanish subtitles. As the info also says it has the option of either spanish or english speech. I just checked it in WinDVD and it DOES have english speech.

Thanx for sharing :)"
,dilbertgeg,2008-08-10T11:01Z,"VLC would not properly choose English (on my PC), and choked on playing it when I clicked PLAY on Menu. 

However, Mplayer (MPUI) (I use the SMplayer interface), DID play it!  (I've not yet installed the latest (July 26? 2008) update of SMplayer on this PC.)  

But SMplayer does not ""understand"" DVD menus (I think they said) but rather than skipping the menus (as usual) it played through the Bowie Song ""Young Americans"" for 30 seconds on the main menu, 30 seconds on the selections 1-4, then 30 seconds more on selections 5-8.  Then it started playing.  It started in Spanish, but when I selected Audio 129 from the SMplayer menu instead of default Audio 128 (Spanish), it plays in English!

I have not yet experimented with the CDR.AVI files also included.  Those might or might not have English lang or subs.  I'm envious of the multi-lingual.  I'm a stupid mono-lingual American!  Thanx!"
