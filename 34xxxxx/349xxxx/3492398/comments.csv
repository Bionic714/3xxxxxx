,ParcoFolgorai,2006-09-06T22:48Z,"hmm.. you might find the multiplayer client on the development site http://mm.wildman-productions.com to be a better one, I found that their client records sensitive PC information :/"
,weedje,2006-11-14T20:01Z,"wildman productions sucks and is in control by people who were banned from the reincarnated services cuz they tried to hack it, u better not visit their site cuz they still on their hacking quests and use keyloggers and stuff, besides reincarnated has like 90% more active members and in working on a new improved matchmaking service :)"
,weedje,2006-11-15T19:31Z,"The reincarnated matchmaker doesnt really record sensitive pc information, all it records is ip adresses and mac adresses to prevent people from registering multiple accounts, and to keep hackers away...
Besides, i've heard dozens of people complain about employees of wildman productions trying to hack them, though i've never heard any complaints about Reincarnated employees trying to hack.
I dont think it would be smart either if they used the pc information for bad intentions, as they are hosted by strategyplanet AKA Gamespy, and they constantly monitor their hosted services, so far reincarnated is hosted by them for 4 or 5 years, so i really doubt that they would do bad things with it..."
,ParcoFolgorai,2007-01-13T08:13Z,"I resent the claims that wildman productions is responsible for hacking any users. If so I havent been made informed of these wrongdoings, but if proof against a staff member is presented I will take prompt action torwards it. Are you going to shun the very people working on Populous 4 so easily? Alot of these claims are spawned by the very admins of populous reincarnated to steer people away from using the wildman production services. At least we still care about the game and are actively supporting it.."

,ParcoFolgorai,2008-12-05T04:17Z,We've recently added the ability to our multiplayer program to allow automated downloading and installing of the game pre-patched / cracked.
