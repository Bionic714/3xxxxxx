3 out of every 5 Americans are now overweight. Children who eat fast food every day 
gain an extra 6 pounds every year. It now appears likely that - for the first time in 
American history - our children will actually have a shorter life span than their 
parents. 

This program about fast food is not just about the fact that grease, sugar, and extra 
calories makes us fat and sick. It is about the giant industries behind fast food that 
change not only our bodies but the body of the earth and the lives of farmers who 
traditionally grew our foods.

An amazing coincidence - and effort too - brought together five eloquent writers and 
activists: The physicist and seed collector Vandana Shiva from India, the Kentucky 
farmer and poet Wendell Berry, Eric Schlosser who wrote: Fast Food Nation, the founder 
of the Slow Food movement Carlo Petrini from Italy and Michael Pollan, teacher and 
author of The Botany of Desire.
