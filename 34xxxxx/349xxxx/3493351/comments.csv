,felixadman,2006-06-08T02:40Z,"Those of you who want to be like Hitler: feel free to put a loaded gun in your mourh, pull the trigger and finish just like him."
,Halbermunken,2006-06-08T11:06Z,Don't be foolish. I've read and listened to a lot of things that I don't agree with through the years. This would be one more in that long list.

,guroth,2006-07-04T08:24Z,"Best way not to make same misstakes is to remember the past.
Bit hard if we are not allowed to read/listen to historic documents even if they are ""ramblings of a mad man""."

,Felicienne,2008-02-10T21:16Z,"Sven Al, thank you very much !
Is this his total production or is there a part 2 ?
The reader impersonates very well his temperment. 
It is interesting to see how this partly jewish young man evolved from an unhappy jailbird with radical ideas to a cooperating with other evil men, reformer of all human kind. He could not have done it alone. The murder of Geli proves that he was as subserviant as he was autocratic.
History repeats itself if we think we are immune. Better watch out.
Thank you again."
