,chapster5,2007-04-21T15:06Z,Plug your USB into the PSP and the other end into the PC turn on your PSP then choose USB mode goto My computer and double click on your PSP when it opens there is a folder called ISO stick the ISO in there then disconnect your PSP goto Game then scroll down to memory card and choose your game. but make sure there is a UMD of any game in there or the game will not boot up :)
