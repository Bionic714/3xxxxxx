,luke97,2006-06-26T18:03Z,"Great! I recently discovered the freeware program GA-Traffic for creating automatically AI traffic on all airports, including every aircraft on my library, flyable or not. This HTAI pack is great for that purpose.

Any chance of releasing more packages? 

Tnx very much!"

,Salomon1260,2006-10-08T17:00Z,"Thats the first and only payware I ever baught. I would recommend everyone to do the same since Henry T. said he would stop doing those packages if the demand was no there. It is really worth 15 bucks. 

As luke said, its great to use with GA-Traffic

Furure plans are for a piper package and a F-16 package I think."
