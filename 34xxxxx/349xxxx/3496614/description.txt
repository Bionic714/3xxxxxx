  Who The F**K Are Aquasonic DJs??

  Well hello there!  We may be familiar to some of you from our mixes from
  a couple of years back - 90s Ambient Techno and Trance 1 & 2, 90s Acid 
  and Live Breaks 2002.  And then we disappeared...  Well we're back with
  a load of new and archive stuff, spanning various genres and eras from 
  the melodic side of progressive house to the all out percussion headmash 
  of the best techno has to offer (that's not to mean we're just 4/4 - the
  breaks are all in here too).  

  So What All This Then??  

  In the mean time here is a little taste of what we've been up to - a 
  short and dirty mix to keep you bouncing about this summer.  From the 
  stomps and breaks of Peace Division and Switch, through the beeps and 
  blurts of Sander K and those abrasive gauls The Micronauts to the 
  building, explosive funk of Rob Babicz and Valentino Kanzyani, we hope 
  we've created a mix that is the aural equivalent of chewing a disco 
  biscuit - up for it, cheeky and quick to kick in!  Perfect for those 
  times you just don't have time for those 2 hour DJ sets - Enjoy :)
