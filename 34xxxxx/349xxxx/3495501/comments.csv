,Mr_Ecks,2006-06-15T12:39Z,Tough shit kids I'm 40+ and I can hear it! It is very individual as there are those in their 20's who can't hear it. The only way to be safe is if Your teacher is over 60.

No...
This is not the ringtone, it is simply a recording of the ringtone playing with some laughter in the background.
As it includes other sound also, like background noise (cars?) and general noise other than the tone itself it is not paticulary useful as a ringtone of this sort."
