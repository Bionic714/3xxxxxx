could someone please post the quakeworld server & client? I cant find a working link on the entire net... shure I find alot of sites claiming to contain it but the links never work."
,k-t-m,2006-06-18T19:29Z,"In my book, best game ever = Doom, though Quake comes pretty close.

The QW stuff should be lying around somewhere on id's FTP server, I think."
,X011011100,2006-06-19T23:17Z,is it a ISO file?
,knaak,2006-06-20T19:37Z,thanks alot for the tip about quakeworld.nu!! even found some active servers :)
,Cr33p1n9 D347h,2006-07-06T18:44Z,Maybe a bit stupid to ask but..... Is it compatible with Windows XP? A lot of older games don't work on it.
,rustyfanz,2006-08-08T03:47Z,"well, havent dl'ed it yet but i figure it is.  the actual CD of quake is NOT  compatable, tried to install like 10 times, but says something like ""Win 16 flow too low"" or some shit, but i know at quakeplanet.com they have alot of new maps and updates and such, which would never work on anything but XP, and i've also heard there are tons of people who have successfully converted it to play on XP....so hopefully it does work, otherwise im f'ed in the a! lol"
