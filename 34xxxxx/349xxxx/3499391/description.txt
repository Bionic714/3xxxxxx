Ezekiel Stone was a cop. Then his wife was raped. He caught the guy who did it, and he killed him.

Three months later he died, and was sent to Hell.

Now, one hundred and thirteen of the most vile souls in Hell have escaped. The Devil needs a hunter to track them, and return them to Hell.

Look alive, Mister Stone.
