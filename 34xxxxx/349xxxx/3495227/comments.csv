Och vad e det för skilnad imellan Episode II - Attack of the Clones och den här?"
,antiterrorstyrkan,2006-06-16T03:54Z,they probably cut out JarJar.. 
,jumbotron,2006-10-08T23:51Z,"More watchable than the original, but not as drastic or as good an edit as the MagnoliaFan version of the first film here which set a very high standard. With only 10 minutes cut out of this film it's still far too long. It keeps too many of the romance scenes for my liking (and unfortunately even adds a deleted Padme family scene) and you still hear a battle droid say ""Roger Roger"". I imagine the romance scenes were kept because the editor felt they were essential for character development, but they are so hamfistedly written and acted, and damage the pace of the film so badly, that the love between Anakin and Padme would be more believable if it was left to your imagination.

The quality is, if anything, slightly better than the first MagnoliaFan edit, which is amazing at 700MB for an over two hour long film. I'm looking forward to his edit of Episode III.

PS. Keep watching to the very end of the credits."
