Description: Bill Morisson used destroyed and ancient footage to create his dark and hypnotic Decasia: State of Decay. It takes amazing vision to take a bunch of junked film and create such an apocalyptic and deeply philosophical work. Through the sheer poetry of its imagery, the decay of the recorded remnants of the past, he shows us the end of a way of life, the fragility of human memory and the futile struggle of man against entropy. A very beautiful and very pessimistic work of art.

I know that I have to give credit to someone for the rip but KG is still down and I can't remember to whom...
