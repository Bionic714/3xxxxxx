,ursule,2006-06-24T11:44Z,well thanks but I'll wait for something with english soundtrack :)
,armand2k4,2006-06-24T13:33Z,"Im sorry but fox released this movie without english soundtrack and thats weird, but I think they dont want this movie to be introduced in the states yet, in recent time fox has been  releasing movies first in Mexico than in USA (I think to avoid piracy in mexico) but this is their first release without english audio"
