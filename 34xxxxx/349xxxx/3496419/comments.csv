,IGotDMCA,2010-02-01T11:13Z,I strongly recommend people not share this. I got a DMCA letter from them. They will enforce protection of their copyrights. Their stuff is high quality but I chose to delete it all after I got the letter.

a western professor speaking about Buddhism? why bother? look for Ajahn Brahm online, for example... plenty of other sources."
