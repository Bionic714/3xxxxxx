,MrEarp,2006-06-23T16:12Z,Great with spanish in a swedish based forum !
,e-razor,2006-06-23T18:09Z,"If this truly is a Swedish based forum why do you express yourself in another foreign language? Is it perhaps the fruit of ill-conceived logic, single-mindedness or xenophobia? [Please check all that apply]"
,cloudmckane,2006-06-27T20:59Z,Maybe he did it so that the author of the foreign-language description could understand what he meant and realize that he did something indecent. Do you really think a Spaniard understands swedish if a Swede doesn't understand Spanish even though Sweden is the land with more foreign-language classes (other than english) in Europe?

,Andtalath,2006-10-05T13:59Z,"I've nothing against it being in spanish, though I would have preferred it with a ""-español/castellano/spanish"" or some other indication that both the subs and the audio where spanish, rendering it pretty useless to all except people who doesn't know english (except for the laughs, spanish voice actors sound so god damn silly)."
,praxiteles,2007-04-21T16:08Z,"I agree with you, andtalath. The problem isn't that the info is in spanish, that's fine.  The problem is that my time is wasted since it wasn't stated in the torrentname."
