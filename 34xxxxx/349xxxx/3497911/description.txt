 Without compromise, without apology, and without question ? a motion picture exploring the deepest complexities of contemporary life. The melon-breasted ANGEL, a living invitation - an exaggerated embodiment of woman... The cushion of evil on the throne of immorality... LANA is seventeen, with a slim beautifully curved body carried gracefully on long, intriguing legs. Truly delicious... LOTTIE... A string of "ladyfingers" that never stop exploding and detonating, with a percussion and snap beyond their size... HAJI...elusive, hauntingly seductive, a sorceress...a naked witch, if you will... SYLVIA...the go-go dancer... with a bosom of truly incredible dimension. And Carol Peters as THE NUDE... cantilevered, capacious with a capital double-D...floating gracefully across the silver screen.

Plot Outline: Tales of eleven losers are told and interwoven. Burt can't satisfy Angel, so she seeks the arms of another man, who is caught by Angel in the arms of another woman. Angel ends up with Justin, who ends up with a co-worker's wife. As Angel and Burt argue, a sorceress watches, and eventually seduces Burt while Angel gets to know Ray, who had previously chased a blonde girl down on the coast. You get the idea.
