,B-manSwe,2006-06-24T00:18Z,"Ok so you need a chipped ps2 to run this and it got swapmagic included, so my question is: why should i need swapmagic when i got my os2 chipped?"
[V],Debender,2006-06-30T21:21Z,"probably, you can start this with swap magic and then you can insert a game and play it(without chip)"

,urmamma,2006-11-14T18:05Z,"I've read in sooo many places that these Swap Magic Discs CAN _NOT_ be burned.

So buy one. You can problably find one for ~24$ somewere.."

,Magictounge,2007-01-28T20:59Z,Bah!! is there any point of downloading all these games without chip or any other crap?
,japanasian,2007-07-08T22:20Z,"I am a moderator and this is pretty much a cheat device you can use on a modded or non modded console the purpose for this EVO edition is it unlocks swap action but not only that but you can use COGSWAP hombrew on it if ya know where to go anyways this is an advanced version for homebrew if you know annything bout PS2 modifications this is a soft mod not a hard mod so enjoy I did....

Thanks for upload larry....Japanasian"
,ant619,2007-09-25T15:38Z,does it matter if i have a mod chip but no magic swap
,6ixtynin9,2007-09-27T22:38Z,"ant619, Are you freaking serious???? Of course you need some type of modification to be able to read burned disc. Otherwise no one will ever buy ps2 games. You can choose the Mod Chip route or the Swap Magic Disc. I prefer the Mod Chip. That is unless you're really really really good at keeping a disc damaged/scratch free."

,mekkeren,2007-12-15T20:39Z,"where can i get SWAP MAGIC , cant find it here on piratebay"
,CCRLH85,2008-01-17T08:55Z,"Burned Swap Magic disks don't work however, this is not a Swap Magic Disk.  This is a version of Action Replay Max EVO that is altered to work with Swap Magic since Action Replay discs don't generally work when using the Swap Magic method.  I'll try this one and see if it works for me ^_^"
,WillyWonkaDoopidyDo,2008-02-03T00:55Z,This works wonderfully!  I wish it was more up to date with the codelist though.  I tried downloading a whole new list and replacing the original on the disc and burning a new copy but it doesnt work
,sObeitZ,2008-02-18T22:07Z,"yu cant play swap magic ... coz the ps2 doesnt read copied cd's or else i m stupid?

tell me how then?"
,sObeitZ,2008-02-18T22:10Z,buuuut im searching for a driver  for my ps2 to ps3 converter... i can put my memory card in it and it has an usb port... so my pc can detect it but i need a driver does any1 HERE got a driver?
,menotyou,2008-10-19T08:51Z,"Ummmmkay, everyone is retarded. This program works perfectly, you have to BUY Swap Magic somewhere, then it allows you to swap in your BURNED copy of this program and everything is smooth sailing from there. BTW all this really does is unlock cheats like Codebreaker, it just happens to work with Swap Magic."
,menotyou,2008-10-19T08:53Z,"The only problem I have found is that it does NOT include the Max Media Creator Software for the PC, which allows you to convert your video files to play on the PS2."
,crazypsy,2008-12-05T20:54Z,"the fat ps2 does play burnt games without a mod chip and has done for years and as far as i know so does the slim i have an unmoded ps2 fat and I play nothin but backups an use cogswap instead of 
swap magic.....and I'm sick of ppl sayin you cant.
i would have been playn backups 2yrs ago only for i listend to clowns:) now you can put ps2 games on hd and play em through usb (kinda slow)if you dont belive me google it...do sum research...dont just say it cant be done"
,Nachtholm,2009-07-22T20:49Z,Does this work with FreeMCboot?
,woomonkies,2009-07-24T20:25Z,"I'm not sure I understand the purpose of this iso.  Yes it loads with swap magic, however it brings up a black configuration screen and then what looks like a boot screen similar to swap magic.

So...it's a boot disc that has to be booted with another boot disc?"
