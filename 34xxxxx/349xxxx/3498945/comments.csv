,Xtremevillan,2006-06-28T16:43Z,Thanks for the heads up Kuka.
,SRXXX,2006-06-29T02:56Z,It should be a false positive as it doesn't have any exploits that i know of and i've just scanned the file with my AV to be extra sure.
,[Spooky],2006-06-30T22:23Z,My antivirus also reported a virus in the pics...
,SRXXX,2006-07-01T01:29Z,"If you're using Norton it wouldn't surprise me... but i'm sure this is 100% clean of anything, i got this from a trusted site and have it myself on my comp, i'm using NOD32 AV, spywareblaster, spy doctor, a2 squared anti troyan finder and Zonealarm firewall, and not one of them has reported this pack to have anything malicious on it, but hey whatever if you ain't sure of it don't download it simple as that."
,ewan34,2006-07-09T12:45Z,"Those of you reporting virus get a good antivirus for christs sake, i've checked this with NOD32, Kaspersky, The cleaner, Spybot and Spysweeper all reported it was clean... and stop bashing people's uploads just for the heck of it

Thx uploader, real quality pictures -)"
