I can upload the loader if you want."

But RJAA (Progress 98.2%)...!?"

I will upload the loader....it is very small & works on all of their sceneries."

,jabbashouse,2006-09-30T17:50Z,"Dear Members,

As of now Saturday 30th 2006 Time 1638hrs GMT i will be Seeding Simwings All Airports.rar.

I have allocated all 8mg of my internet speed for it, Up and Download speed.

All welcome.

Thank you,

jabbashouse.

P.S All you need to do i just copy and paste all the Airport folders from this rar into your MSFS2004 Addon Scenery, and your all set to enjoy these wonderfull Airports. You may have to go into your Scenery list in MSFS2004 and Add the Area/Airport and restart MSFS2004.

Thanks goes out to rroger99 for uploading this torrent."
,jabbashouse,2006-10-01T12:07Z,"Dear Members,

rrrodger99 is not to blame, but be aware that the Airport LFMN has a Faulty Module so please do not install it as it will make MSFS2004 crash to desktop.

I have not as of yet found out how to fix the module, as im having trouble tracking it down so as to replace it. I will post here and seed the module when i find it.

Apart from that all the other Airports are working perfectly with excellent frame rates.

Thank you,

jabbashouse."
