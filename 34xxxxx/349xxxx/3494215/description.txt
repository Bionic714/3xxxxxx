In this inspiring tale from the biblical book of Genesis, young shepherd Jacob (Matthew Modine) falls in love with and wants to marry pretty Rachel (Lara Flynn Boyle), the daughter of his Uncle Laban (Giancarlo Giannini). Lacking a dowry, Jacob toils seven years as his uncle's indentured servant to win Rachel's hand -- only to have the calculating Laban dupe him into another seven years of labor.
