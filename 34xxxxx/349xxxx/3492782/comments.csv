But because they are ghosts, they are not allowed to go there in one journey, but have to make 9 journeys. That's what Norton Ghost 9 Espanol is all about. Play it, you will definitely like the action. There are also some nice boobs in it if you like that kind of thing. So, now I'm going to waist my time on something else I guess."
