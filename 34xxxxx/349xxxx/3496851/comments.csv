,pritchardepic,2008-08-29T01:18Z,"Downloaded this. Once the download was complete (yes, it made it to 100%), I tried to extract the files, and the zip archive was corrupted. I wouldn't piss with downloading this, not for the time it takes. Slow seeders."
,pritchardepic,2008-08-29T03:40Z,These torrents are now obsolete. All the EAX and Speaker control software is now bundled and can be downloaded here: http://support.creative.com/downloads/download.aspx?nDownloadId=10125
,kithylin,2009-06-08T09:05Z,"@ pritchardepic: NO you CAN NOT get the audio console, the graphical EQ, or anything else off the website anymore, creative pulled it and ONLY HAS THE DRIVERS now. If you want creative's EAX controls, or any of the other additional software, you're truely SOL. If you're like me and lost your install DISC, I've called creative, they don't even sell this disc either, and you can't download it, you either have it or you're screwed.

BTW thank you for uploading this! "
