Amber joins the Music portion of the South By Southwest (SXSW) Festival in Austin, Texas, where more than 1200 artists come together to perform, including legends Neil Young, Beastie Boys, and Morrissey. Amber will join the party and bring viewers video podcast highlights from the Australian East Coast, from Web-savvy indie filmmakers better known as the Four Eyed Monsters, and our own home-grown Toronto techies Andy and Sean who explain optical drives with fluffy marshmellows. There's lots more planned for this show, including some exclusive interviews with presenters and on-lookers at the official SXSW outdoor BBQ.
