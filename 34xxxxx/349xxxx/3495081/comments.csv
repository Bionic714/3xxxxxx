,XsuperXdudeX,2006-06-14T18:08Z,torrent can be downloaded but when clicking on it --it doesnt make the file in the client--shows up as an error--can't find avi file because it dosn't have it--faulty torrent--may need to be redone--
,Cough,2006-06-15T02:42Z,I think this relates to TPB database issues over the past few days.  Looks like the torrent is working again now.
,XsuperXdudeX,2006-06-16T17:13Z,cool--thanks for checking will try again--looks like a good set of songs--thanks for sharing!
