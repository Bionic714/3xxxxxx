Keep the Great_Britain_Plus-Map on the memorycard and just copy over the Scandimap to the same memorycard...
"
,tinywiz,2006-06-17T09:49Z,"Oh... and use the crack, not you real activation (!)"
,RedTiger,2006-06-17T12:16Z,Have you tryed this on a tomtom go?
,tinywiz,2006-06-17T16:39Z,"Nope, not on Tomtom Go. 
Only PPC version."
,Miller,2006-06-27T18:10Z,Does this work with TOMTOM ONE?!

,*Rune*,2006-08-07T23:43Z,"Fungerer helt fint på min Nokia 6680 med Tomtom5 Mobile med Progr 5.20 (443) Scandinaviamap V421. Legg inn hele filen som heter Pluss på minnekortet. Du må beholde Scandinaiva mappen som du alt har der, så stort minnekort er å anbefale. Men den fungerer helt supert:)"
