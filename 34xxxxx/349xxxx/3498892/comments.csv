,ozcar85,2008-07-31T19:16Z,"I just got this torrent. Managed to get it working w Magic Swapa and burnt it w Roxio Creator but not w/ out a few problems... first of all the whole geme came out in black and whit. Ironically, no color. And second, i got this weird line going across my tv screen toward the top. Other than that, the geam works fine. "
,psphackerowned,2008-08-15T10:18Z,why the fuck would you use roxio to burn a ps2 game use powerISO
,hlmindustries,2008-11-22T05:25Z,"if it comes in in black and white then its probably a pal game and your using an ntsc, or vice versa"

It's English!

Patched with ESR Patcher and burned with ImgBurn on 8x speed on a DVD-R

It's a really nice game, very good graphics for PS2"

,TheBunkster,2012-06-25T10:06Z,@ozcar85 That means that your running the wrong format of game you need to convert the iso from PAL to NTSC or vice versa.
