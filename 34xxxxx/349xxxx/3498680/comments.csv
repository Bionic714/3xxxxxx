,DanLoader,2006-09-20T20:20Z,"hyvet - it isn't a real documentary. Think ""Spinal Tap"", or ""Best In Show"".

Only problem with this file is that the movie is supposed to be an aspect ratio of 1:85:1 however the image has been stretched to a 2:35:1 ratio, which means everyone is stretched really wide (or squished from the top and bottom if you prefer to see it that way.)"

,weebarra,2008-07-27T04:31Z,"David Lumby once made sweet love to his own clenched fist, which is why many people consider him to be a ""wanker""... Such ignoramuses cannot embrace the true beauty of self loving, but David Lumby can, and frequently (up to 13 tines daily) does.

Lumby is a proud wanker, and never shall he tire from being told so, shouted across the street while he takes his aged mother shopping in British Home Stores."
