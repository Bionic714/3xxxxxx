,The Soft Touch,2006-06-21T11:44Z,Keep it up........ thx
,Miguel28,2006-06-21T18:38Z,"Since i have 4 Elvis movies uploading and my upload speed isn't that great, i'll will pause this one for a while... sorry for the incovenience"
,jerbe,2006-06-21T19:07Z,Are you sure this is a NTSC? Seem funny with german audio on a NTSC. I would have guessed PAL from the audio tracks and the subtitles...
,Leton,2006-06-25T23:22Z,seeda please
,sleepyman2,2006-06-26T11:19Z,"Hi. It look like this torrent has the same fault as your previous  Elvis upload. The only ones there can get this, is people with azureus 2.3.0.6. Please chech your settings. (Multitrackers). Thanks"
,stuffer,2006-06-28T08:33Z,downloading seems to work when you block all users with Azureus 2.3.0.6!
,Miguel28,2006-06-28T12:10Z,And how do i block it with Utorrent?
,vold998,2006-07-03T14:38Z,"is this dvd the same as your viva las vegas which states: This DVD is untouched and has the following characteristics:

or is this dvd the same as your fun in acapulco which states: I had to ""shrink"" this one to the normal size of a DVD, the original has 7GB

??"
,Miguel28,2006-07-04T09:50Z,"No, this one is untouched
The only one i hav to shtink was really fun in acapulco.. so far ;)"
,vold998,2006-07-06T13:42Z,this is TOO big to burn on a dvd-r??
,Miguel28,2006-07-06T23:31Z,"I guess so, use dvdshrink, the quality will be almost perfect"
,jane34,2006-08-07T02:58Z,hmmmm... 12kB/s down - 90kB/s up and 170MB waste (31xhasherror) and I have only got 47%........... What's WRONG????
,pappe,2006-08-26T20:05Z,"Surely it's PAL, not NTSC."
,Miguel28,2006-10-12T17:24Z,"Anyone who's interested in being a part of a great Elvis Forum, please contact me... lots of free stuff"
