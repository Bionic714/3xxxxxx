
We - Unauthorized Arundhati Roy-2005-DVDR
-------------------------------------------------------

This film is not about Arundhati Roy... its about her words.
In 2004 she was awarded the Sydney Peace Prize.

The film examines the widely unregarded worlds of Anthropology and Geopolitics in a very dynamic manner, and is probably stylistically quite unlike any documentary that you have previously seen. It covers the world politics of power, war, corporations, deception and exploitation. It is particularly hard hitting when it comes to the United States and western powers in general.
