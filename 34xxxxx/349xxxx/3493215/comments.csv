The original versions ARE available. Well, at least now, and only for a short time. Apparently they decided to release the unharmed (original) versions of episodes 4-6 as limited editions which will only be available till the end of the year."

,CaptainBeefheart314,2008-02-13T09:38Z,"Well gentlemen, it appears tales of the poor downloadspeed were not exaggerated... what sort of connection are you running, 14,4K? I feel like I'm back in the nineties... Have a 24Mbps connection myself, so if any of you bums are limiting your uploads and holding grudges (...) feel free to kick it into gear: I have installed no limit to uploading, and would appreciate you doing the same for once.

Time to move it people...."
,einsteiniumbicarbonate,2008-04-06T16:20Z,The only problem with this torrent is the empire strikes back avi is squished heightwize... might need to download a new version of that if you don't want to unsquish it yourselves.
,deltix1,2008-06-08T14:36Z,"Whell finaly after 5 days i mannaged to download the whole torrents.

Now you don't hear me complain that it took that long, but i think that some people here don't get the idea how torrents work.

One tip that might speed up your connection (atleast what i do).

I have one download at a time and 4 or 5 upload at a time, deu to my internet connection.
Set up azureaus that it wil atleast seed 2 the amount of the torrent it self.

So if you want to increase the speed of this torrent, stop the slow uploads and low downloads, and download one torrent at a time, share it twice.

And yes i allready blocked several people who apparently think they don't have to upload, only 2 or 3. But this is enough do make the torrent dead.

Seed or more people wil disconnect or even make their uplead slower and we all can start to enjoy progress bars for the rest of our lives."
,deltix1,2008-06-08T14:38Z,don't mind the typos
