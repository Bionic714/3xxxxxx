Do you remember S2k or better yet Oscar? 

Avenger is Oscar's predecessor with a bit of s2k rolled into it. 

It contains over 70,000 serials and has the ability to make pre-loaded fixes/regg and cracks right on your desktop. 

Some AV's complain about it's crack making abilities and it is a false postive. Avenger can still run if you choose to delete the component but it will also lose it's fix making abilities.
