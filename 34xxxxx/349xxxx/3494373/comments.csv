PNAC cabal must've cheered 9/11, they needed it."
,poincare,2006-06-11T08:39Z,"More tin foil hat rubbish.  All debunked.  They spew this garbage saying that they want the truth.  These lunatics couldn't handle the truth, nor would they know it if it hit them in the head.

This movie is an exercise in illogical argument, bad science, delusional ravings."

,pelgrim108,2006-06-11T09:56Z,"I visited screwloosechange and found that its ""debunking"" was nothing more than mindless disinfo. They take the 911comission report for truth. They ""debunk"" loosechange by comparing it to the report. For instance the report says that suspicious putoptions on the airlines involved have actually occurred but were not suspicious because the could not be linked with Al Qaida. 

Do you agree with such wisdom?

Religious nuts are all the same..Weather they live in the white house, in settlements on the west bank or hiding in Tora Bora..No reagrd for human life or suffering..May they all rot in hell for the hell they create for other people."
,alanwatts,2006-06-29T16:10Z,"I have til this day since late december 2005 not found one single scientific and truthful debunking of Loose Change. Ofcourse Dylan has made some minor mistakes, but those will be fixed in the LC3 ED. Ive been investigating the 911-drama for almost 7 months now and I still find LC a very very good movie for beginners in the 911-truth."

,jen_jen,2006-09-05T18:27Z,"hmm kinda funny though... when they interwiev the guy that rents out small airplanes in the beginning, he talks about Hani, the terrorist... ""That's about the closest description I can get.. I mean can give."""
