Originally uploaded by... someone... It disappeared along with everything else, so I´m reupping it. 

I will add the other seasons, the movies and the OVAs, as people download and take over the seeding of this one.

This is the same torrent as used to be here before, so anyone who has already got it, feel free to help with the seeding.



Story summary: 16 year old Ranma is a promising young martial artist. During a training trip to China, he and his father fall under a curse. Whenever they come into contact with cold water, they change shape. His father becomes a panda, and Ranma becomes a girl.

To add insult to injury, he then has to return to Japan, where he is introduced to his fiancée; a violent tomboy, who thinks of Ranma´s curse as a manifestation of his perverse nature.

As the story progresses, more girls show up to make claims on Ranma as their fiancé, he becomes the target of a few highly dislikeable male rivals, and he and his tomboy slowly fall in love. Not that they ever admitt it, even in the last episode, but... go read the manga.


Generally humorous, a tad bit of violence, and a touch of romance.
