mmmmm"
,z4r4th,2006-07-04T22:53Z,Plz reseed.
,techcf,2006-07-06T20:00Z,"I am seeding this for two trackers now. I tried adding piratebay as a second tracker to the torrent file and upload it, but no luck. So now I got two torrents for this one movie going.

My Netopia modem (ngt) doesnt like heavy traffic so it hangs some times. But Ill keep seeding this. For more material like this check www.chdtv.net and bt.hd-tv.cn (google translate is your friend)

Much of that stuff should be on piratebay too! Too little hidef material here"
,xtofermagnus,2006-07-06T20:51Z,can someone tell how to convert these files into a dvd
,techcf,2006-07-06T23:53Z,"magnus: better download the dvd then, it has been professionally converted from the high-res original material. Youll get better result than doing the conversion yourself"
,xtofermagnus,2006-07-07T09:42Z,smart advice. thanks techcf but all dvds on piratebay are shrunk. Know any full size dvd tracker ?
,phuzz,2006-07-09T12:43Z,"Wow!  Just the sample for this is amazing, tried playing it on a mac mini and it almost died.  thanks for this techcf, I'll be seeding it when i've got it all"

Eh... I hope you mean ""1920x1080""..."
,Shalimar,2007-03-27T20:52Z,Sweet... hope some seeders stay for this..  this is a MUST have!  :)
,mflana,2007-04-08T02:03Z,Need seeders!!! There are roughly 5+ users at 97.5% of this huge upload...
,big_nanas,2007-04-10T11:06Z,"Arrgh, I've got (very quickly) to 98% and it's now stalled!"
,mflana,2007-04-10T15:29Z,"yeah c'mon now 7 out of 13 peers are at 98+ percent w/ NO seeds, i'll see I just need the last bits of the files!"
,ApocalypseBob,2008-05-25T20:37Z,"Did you rip this from a true 1080 source?

Don't want to complain, but the lines didn't look as sharp as I had expected and the subtitles looks like they have some extrapolation. Subs are also burned into the video (so you can't turn them off or use subs of other languages).

I think I'll grab a 720 or plain DVD version instead."
,01eg,2009-01-04T16:27Z,seed pls !!!
,NobodiJones,2009-12-12T23:49Z,"WTF...91.6% and it hasnt moved in over a week...PLEASE....People!  Seed till 3.0 ratio...
