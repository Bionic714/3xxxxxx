,speakeasy,2006-06-11T21:36Z,"OMG - how many gigabytes!
Thanks . . ."
,disobedient,2006-06-12T03:23Z,"I'd just like to add that even though TPB's tracker says there are no seeders, I AM SEEDING, and will continue to seed until there are enough copies floating around."
,ianken,2006-06-12T21:32Z,OMG. The wife is a huge Who fan. Thanks. Will seed. By the time I get this all downloaded I'll probably have FIOS. Lol.
,Blacknoon,2006-06-15T02:29Z,"What format is this? PAL, NTSC? You said these are rip from DVD's does this mean they inlude the menus?"
,ianken,2006-06-16T00:35Z,These are mpeg4/divx/xvid AVI files ripped from DVD. It looks like the lone seeder is down too but there are are 56 folks in the swarm but we do not have a complete copy. Hopefully the seeder can get back online.
,Blacknoon,2006-06-16T02:48Z,"Thanks for the replay but it didn't answer my question. Are the files PAL or NTSC? PAL is region 2 and NTSC is region 1 (Canada and American). Which one is it? Also, are there menus? I'm assuming not if they are AVI files but mpg might. "
,ianken,2006-06-16T05:47Z,Since they are *AVI files* there is no region coding and there is no PAL/NTSC issue other than those the person who ripped the DVDs had to deal with converting them to AVI. There will be no menus since avi does not support menus.
,ianken,2006-06-16T05:56Z,One other thing: I'm curious to see how he got the directors comentary in there without using a container like OGG or MKV.
,mrking33,2006-06-17T07:38Z,does anybody know if the seeder is coming back? 
,disobedient,2006-06-19T04:27Z,"I *am* seeding this, for christ's sake.  Jump on the torrent and check for yourself before believing TPB's dodgy tracker stats."
,disobedient,2006-06-19T04:31Z,"Only some of them are from DVD, (the ones with alternate audio tracks).  *ALL* are AVI."
,disobedient,2006-06-19T04:31Z,"Most are either 512x384 or 640x480 NTSC (29.97 fps), a couple are @25fps, and at least one is in archive-format (The Talons of Weng-Chiang @23.976 fps.)"
,disobedient,2006-06-20T14:07Z,Seeding Update: 25% done!  Just another couple of weeks until Who Nirvana.  :)
,ianken,2006-06-24T09:56Z,"I think the issue with wondering where you went Mr. Disobedient is that the clients are showing no seed as well. On my end you seem to drift in and out. 

Looks like 33% available now but uTorrent reports no seed in the swarm. 

Anyrate, keep it comming. :-)

On a side note does anyone know what happened to Tobio26 and his excellent new who DVB uploads? Ever since the bust I have not been able to find them via search."
,disobedient,2006-06-25T05:14Z,"The clients are showing no seed, and yet some how magically the percent complete has gone from 25% to 35% in 4 days at 30kbps upload on a 55 GIG torrent.  Amazing that."
,disobedient,2006-06-27T01:08Z,"I didn't mean to sound snotty, by the way.  It's just frustrating that TPB's tracker is so out-of-tune with reality.  If there are ever any outages, I promise you I'll be back as quickly as possible."
,disobedient,2006-06-27T01:10Z,"Also: you can find the latest Who releases on IsoHunt.com if they're not here.  The new season is absolutely fab, though it will be a shame to see Billie Piper leave the show."
,ianken,2006-06-30T05:09Z,"Don't stress it dude! This is awesome, almost 50%.

I feel like it's the late 80s and I'm pulling down some big ass Amiga demo on a 1200bps modem to my 20MB(not a typo) hard disk. :-)"
,disobedient,2006-07-01T01:29Z,"Ah yes, the 'ol ST225.  Good, reliable drive.

Also, I'm happy to report that WE ARE PAST THE HALFWAY POINT!  It's all downhill from here, folks!"
,disobedient,2006-07-02T05:07Z,"Update (7/1 @11PM EST): I'm taking the system down for a short time to upgrade the storage.  I'll have it back up ASAP, just hold tight.  I'm not going anywhere.  :)"
,disobedient,2006-07-02T06:01Z,Update: System back up again and seeding (with another terabyte of space!  Whoo hoo!)
,disobedient,2006-07-08T01:26Z,Update: 66% complete!  Just 1/3rd more...
,yell0,2006-07-09T11:17Z,yay!
,yell0,2006-07-09T11:24Z,I just hit 70%
,disobedient,2006-07-11T03:05Z,75% done!  Thanks everyone for your patience... this has to be the longest I've ever seeded something.
,disobedient,2006-07-12T05:21Z,80%...
,tavisjohn,2006-07-12T21:16Z,"I am currently at 82.9% and I will be seeding this for at least 2 months after I reach 100%

So when you reach 100% please seed!  I will post here when I hit 100%!"
,disobedient,2006-07-14T11:38Z,We've just hit 90%!
,disobedient,2006-07-15T17:23Z,Almost done... the swarm's at 95% now.
,insider666,2006-07-15T23:20Z,I'm hoping all you 95%er s dont all bail out on us 10%ers when yr done!! This has to be the monster torrent of all time. Much respect to disobedient for putting it up!! 
,ianken_ms,2006-07-16T05:37Z,I will not bail. I'm at 96.5 and will seed indefinitly. I'm curious to see what the swarm does when a gob of us hit 100% at the same time. You late commers will get lucky. We've been at this for over a month. Lol. 
,disobedient,2006-07-19T12:04Z,"99.7% complete at this point.  I'm probably going to be at work when it hits 100%, so I'd like to pre-emptively say thanks to everyone for sticking with me and I hope you enjoy the shows."
,tavisjohn,2006-07-19T20:56Z,"I have reached 100% so I will be seeding till at least Septeber 19 2006!

My current Share Ratio is 2.370.  So let's see how high it gets over the next 2 months!"
,disobedient,2006-07-20T02:28Z,"Wow, after more than a month of constant seeding, it's finally done!  It brings me great joy to have put so much time into something that I know will be appreciated by hundreds of others.  Now, what can I upload for an encore?  Maybe the complete Twilight Zone?  Hmm..."
,ianken_ms,2006-07-20T07:22Z,Woot. 100%. Seeding. 
,hughJ25,2006-08-11T07:55Z,"gonna buy a 320GB just for this, almost jumped out of my chair seeing this.. all this.. available.  keep seeding please till i can find an extra drive :)))"
,AlexJonesRules,2006-08-25T06:20Z,"disobedient,

if you really did all the work for this, you not only rock, you rock thecasbahamadeusenisteinmegaaliciousfunktopolis.  Unfortunately, I have no P. Davidson eps. to contribute, however, I will seed this pup for twice as many days as it takes me download it.  I will search for PD tho."
,AlexJonesRules,2006-08-25T06:31Z,poo!  looks like I caught this late.  Hope it stays active 'tlil I get the chance to seed.  does anyone know where to buy the scarf? ebay???i used to watch this on PBS in the 80's.  takes me back...
,AlexJonesRules,2006-08-27T09:04Z,Woo-hoo!  20% in 2 days.  At this rate I should be able to finish by the 19th of September.  Please keep seeding!!
,AlexJonesRules,2006-09-03T01:36Z,"50% 

Should be to 100% by the 9th.  I'll seed for at least 2 months after it completes.  

Thanks Disobedient!"
,disobedient,2006-09-07T03:26Z,Just wanted to say thanks to the seeders keeping this alive for the rest of the community!
,hughJ25,2006-09-13T05:00Z,"you deserve all the thanks for putting this up, this is really a stunning collection."
,hughJ25,2006-09-13T05:02Z,I've been trying to piece together a Baker collection for years now.  To find all this in one spot really knocked my socks off.
,AlexJonesRules,2006-09-16T07:23Z,"I hit 100% a couple daze ago.

I wil seed until the new year.  

Thanks very much, disobedient.  This really takes me back..."
,disobedient,2006-09-17T03:48Z,"OK, I was finally able to complete my Peter Davidson collection...  So, you folks got another 23 GBs free?  I'll post a link to the torrent when it's up, and seed for however long it takes!"
,AlexJonesRules,2006-09-24T19:37Z,"Looking forward to the PD episodes.  I just changed my up speed to maximum so I can provide the TB eps even faster.  Let's get started on the PD, yo!"
,yblaidddrwgmawr,2006-10-09T07:54Z,"Wow...

Hi, I'm one of the new fans of Who; I started being a fan when I saw a marathon on Scifi, now I'm hooked.

I'm very surprised that torrents exist for entire Doctors except for Peter Davidson, which I hear is already being made.

I'm downloading right now, and I have 7 MB in 20 min.  When (or I should say if) I finish, I'll try to seed as much as I can."
,satanprince,2006-10-17T16:28Z,"May I ask a question please?

I am new to burning but this complete Dr WHo with Tom Baker is my wifes best Doctor who and when Iam done she wants me to seed and I will but is there a way to burn these so you can have teh full screen if so how and with what software."
,NeoJew,2006-10-26T16:12Z,"I'm at 8.6%
Avg D/L: 52 kb/s

I've been working on this for a day or two so far, and I'll keep it going as long as I can after."

,SchnielZ,2007-03-13T22:54Z,Lovely stuff! I'm a late arrival so i hope for good speeds! I'll of course help seed once done :).
,Luke-Cage,2007-04-01T16:00Z,"You rock, disobedient.  I've been amazed at how hard it is to find the Tom Baker episodes.  Will definitely help seed this...hope others do the same."
,f1fanatic,2007-04-22T09:35Z,MARVELLOUS! i'm a biiiig DOctor Who fan and since i live in India all i get of Who is old books.Tom Baker is my favourite.THANK YOU!!
,mitcorp2002,2007-05-05T02:42Z,Is anyone still seeding this torrent?
,rocket100,2007-06-04T20:23Z,"Thank you disobedient.  I'm a big Dr Who fan.
Does anyone have the other doctors? I'm looking for the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Doctors."
,rocket100,2007-06-05T18:04Z,Yes all the files are .AVI but you will need a DivX codec to play it.  Windows Media Player was playing audio and no video. Had to update my DivX codec.  I could be wrong buts its working now.
,autonomousg,2007-06-10T04:35Z,"Oh yeah, I forgot to add....I've tried opening the files with mpc and that hasn't worked either....heeeeeellllppp!"
,rocket100,2007-06-17T19:25Z,Some of the files are DivX while others are Xvid.  Some of the Xvid files were using beta codecs. yuck. I installed the newest DivX and converting all the files to DivX. 
,rocket100,2007-06-18T02:31Z,Dr Who - 082 4G Pyramids of Mars has a serious delay.  Virtualdub has detected an improper VBR audio encoding.  Trying to figure out how to fix it.
,d_oro,2007-06-20T11:18Z,"Seed please! It's awfully slow: 2-5 kb/s, with 3-4 seeders. Why?"
,jgogol,2007-06-23T02:50Z,5 % downloaded and only 41 days to go.I'll seed this if I'm still alive in 41 days.
,TmC47,2007-09-18T23:12Z,"(sniffle) I am overwhelmed by this here torrent. I pray it has retained some of the magic from yesteryear (I was 8 y.o. in 1972). Great effort, Disobedient (may you continue to be).

@ezboard: STFU @$$h013"
,disobedient,2007-10-06T16:28Z,"Glad to see this is still alive after more than a year!  I don't know why people are saying there are problems with the videos since they've worked fine for me.  I'll check the ones people mentioned and re-up if there is indeed a problem.  I do hope you're all using VLC or MPC and *not* Windows Media Mangler.

Rocket100: VirtualDub will give always give you a VBR error unless you use VirtualDubMod.

,DSign-NL,2007-11-10T11:56Z,"Hello there, disobedient [& all Doctor Who fans as well of course]! 

Thank you so VERY MUCH for this awesome upload! Tom Baker is my favorite Doctor and I have so many great [& scary] moments when I saw this great series when I was just a little kid! Brings back so many good memories!

Here in The Netherlands we weren't able to see all the episodes because many parents complained that the series was to scary for their [younger] kids and so the show wasn't aired anymore *sniff*...so...after all these many many years...NOW I finally can watch every single episode! *yeah!*

Thanks for your work & generosity! *thumbsup*

Take care,
DSign"
,berrys66,2007-11-13T07:31Z,I've been trying to seed this but the tracker has been offline for the last 4 or 5 days ...
,Knowledge916,2007-11-14T03:42Z,I have also had a problem connecting to the tracker since Friday.  My other torrents are fine; I am seeding other things but can't connect with this torrent.  Very frustrating.
,BerugasLabor,2007-12-17T19:00Z,"Sweeet lord, a year and a half and this torrent is still goin strong. Now i finally have the space to dl this but it will probably take a while :) 55 gig its just massive. downloading now at ~100k/s so this will be done in around 6-7 days, well no hurry :p

thank you so very very much for this"
,ldangussca,2007-12-26T16:00Z,I've been downloading this thing for like a month now... and worth the wait!!! I will seed this one for as long as I can!!!

,SZ9E9X9T,2008-01-04T19:05Z,Yep. There be seeders. Azureus is showing 5(22) right now. Slow but steady. I've been downloading now for 11 days and just hit 50%. If everyone seeds for their download time it would help a lot.
,JoeLego,2008-01-06T01:29Z,"Torrent Ettiquite 101

Seed for at least as long as it takes to dl.

i.e. If it takes 2 minutes, seed for 2 minutes

If it is HUGE and it takes 2 DAYS, then seed for 2 days.

Just a rule I live by. Cheers ;) "
,JoeLego,2008-01-06T01:37Z,"And if it takes 2 WEEKS to dl, then please seed for a week to help out us noobs ;)"

,_gantz_,2008-01-14T01:40Z,I love Doctor Who.
,hunky_trucker,2008-01-15T15:36Z,"An awesome piece of work-thanks.

I particularly like 'The Horns Of Nimon' , considered by many to  be the worse episode in the series.
Bollocks ! It's so bad at times, that it's fantastic ! 

The character of Seth , played by Simon Gipps-Kent,is just  too cute in his yellow costume. A very popular child-actor in the 70's ,early eighties, he was my first 'gay-crush' 
and the reason my dad caught me 'playing with myself' whilst watching Dr.Who ! Oh ! Those
Happy Days !

He sadly died of an overdose in his early thirties."
,Tarheel1976,2008-01-22T04:15Z,"I enjoy Tom Baker and other Whos. I wonder if I should have tried this large of a p2p for one of my first downloads. I am about 30 GBs through the 55 or so. The AVIs being created are not recognized by WMP or VLC(I think thats right). Is it just a Divx issue ? I thought I was up to date on those. Is there a link to fix that ? I wold be just as happy to play it in WMP. Oddly, VLC wanted to play it as an audio file. It did not even try to opne a screen. Help please !"
,Tarheel1976,2008-01-22T04:59Z,Further update on my problem. I tried an AVI program called Hyplay. It said the AVI I tried did not have a video component. Is that because it did not finish downloading the AVI all the way ? It was already about 350 MBs.
,Tarheel1976,2008-01-22T21:12Z,"Still needing some help. The entire download was not finished, but I had one file that was as large as the file listsaid it should be. I tried to open it in WMP, VLC, Hyplay and DivX. It wold not open in any but VLC and it opened it as an audio file but did not play the track. DivX said it did not have a video. It was 310MB and VLC played it in about20 seconds."
,Tarheel1976,2008-01-22T22:01Z,"I continue to have trouble. I have tried opening a file that appears to be finished downloading with WMP, VLC, Hyplay and DivX. I have tried some of the codes packs. Of these, only VLC would open it and it tried to as an Audio file. It did not play a sound and was finished in about 20 seconds although it was a 320MB AVI file. DivX said it did not have video on it. WMP said it was not a supported file type or missing codec.  Is it not playing because the overall download did not finish ? Any help would be greatly appreciated. If I have to try to download again, I am willing to, but I want to avoid another problem. If you think I just need to wait until the whole thing is done, I can also do that. I also tried to convert with the DivX converter. It said that file type was not supported. I am lost."
,BerugasLabor,2008-01-25T19:04Z,"Nice to see this torrent doing fine, ive been uploading 445 gigs now, no reason not to keep seeding this for a coupple of months more :p

Anyways ive been doing some searching for the ""other doctors"" and for anyone wanting all the episodes of the third doctor (can't see any reason not to :), Jon Pertwee, you can find a 20gig torrent on mininova containing them all. Actually in general i would say mininova is a more usefull site than the tpb for finding torrents with the doctor, no disrespect meant to the bay :)"
,Tarheel1976,2008-01-28T16:11Z,I am only downloading one file at a time. Is that the way this one works ? Is there a way to increase that ? Anyone with advice?
,Ejrech,2008-01-30T00:08Z,"@Tarheel1976:

Try using GSpot (http://www.headbands.com/gspot/) to determine what codec is needed, whether it's installed, etc."
,Tarheel1976,2008-02-03T23:48Z,"Just curious if anyone has any ideas to help. My download is still going on at about 20kb/s average. With all the people that have dowloaded this already, I would think I could get a better speed than that. Any one have any suggestions ?"

,timeslip007,2008-02-15T17:14Z,"I've been downloading this since  jan 11 '08 and it's feb 15 '08 and I just hit 90.7 percent.. Not complaining just explaining about how long it can take to download if most your connects go at 20kb/sec.

Tarheel1976 - I'm using Utorrent 1.7 and on that it creates a file using ALL of the space of the completed file as a buffer and writes the parts to the correct place in the file as they are downloaded. So when I started downloading this ALL 55.12 GB were immediately used up as a save even though I hadn't actually downloaded anything yet.  It's possible that the file your trying to play doesn't actually have any data in it yet."
,Tarheel1976,2008-02-17T18:51Z,"Timeslip007, I think you are absolutely right. I am finally at 98%, but the other times, the files were empty files. Thank you so much for responding. Maybe my questions will help other people later.
I am also confused about the speed. With all the times this has been dowloaded, you would think the speed from some of those folks would be better."

Da 5 Docs!"
,why_me1701,2008-04-19T03:39Z,"Oh, Tarheel,
If the post about not having the actual file complete yet isn't your problem, try removing all those world beating, ""you can't live without them"" CODEC packs. As in, soup too many CODECs, like cooks will spoil things.
I had the same problems.
I had more CODECs installed that Bill Gates has DLLs. Blow 'em away and get the latest VLC. All it needs is XVID and DIVX, maybe.
I downloaded it and played everything I tried without installing a single CODEC. That is, until I downloaded an AVI that GSPOT said was a DIVX. Downloaded DIVX 6 CODEC Only!

Keep them at a minimum and avoid the Pro DIVX pack! I also found a pack called ""CCCP"".
I am getting all I need with
VLC 0.8.6e
DIVX 6 CODEC only
XVid MPEG4 Video CODEC
G-Spot
Auto Gordian Knot (not rip pack)
DVD Shrink
DVD Decrypt
DVD Region Free
UltraISO
and Nero 7 Premium (Nero Vison to burn DVD).
Go to http://www.doom9.org/index.html?/software.htm web site. Good CODECs and utils there."

3> I can only download a couple of episodes a week (that's still twice as many per week as I got off the Beeb) but I`ll keep seeding what I can for years to come.

4> For the record I am slowly buying the DVDs of these episodes, as and when I can afford them, which I would not have done had I not been reminded how good these really were...

So PirateBay is actually responsible for generating royalties/revenue payments...oh dear...will that upset the lawyers...should PirateBay charge the BBC for advertising????"

,fokker1918,2008-08-16T20:38Z,wonderful seed! Justa quick question: Is there any way of removing the director's commentary from the few that have it? Thanks again!
,disobedient,2008-09-17T00:36Z,"To remove the commentary, you need to use a media player that can support multiple audio streams.  VLC is the most popular; it's also open source--so it's free.  Once playing the file in VLC, you simply choose a different audio track from the Audio menu."
,disobedient,2008-09-17T00:39Z,"Also, to Tarheel1976 or anyone else having trouble viewing the files: (in general) the file must be completely downloaded before you can play it.

Currently the tracker says 45 seeders and many, many more sharing.  Thanks for sharing your bandwidth, everyone..."

I'll seed for at least a month, if not more.  At the moment I've turned down my max up speed because I'm also downloading other Doctor Who compilations, but once they're all done I'll turn the max up speed and connections nice and high.

And thank you, disobedient!  I've convinced my son to watch through these old episodes, and he _loves_ them!"

A=10
V=10
Story=10+++

Hats off this doctor was the best!!!!"
,Green-Banana,2010-11-19T15:00Z,The net isn't flooding with episodes because of the racist BBC internet policies and corporate bullshit trying to shut down the free-for-all enterprise that the internet should be.  
,QJo,2010-11-29T00:33Z,"@mchristy63

Why on Earth would you want to delete the commentary track? It's added content, it's free, and it does not add significantly to the download size enough to make any difference. 
No there is not a file you can delete. The commentary track is encoded as a secondary audio stream within the AVI file itself, the only way to remove it is to re-encode the AVI file and select which audio stream you want to keep.
If the reason you want to remove this stream is because it's the only audio you can hear or select, then I would suggest getting rid of your piece of crap media player (let me guess... Windows Media Player?) and try something a little more capable like VLC Media Player. It's free and it will let you select which audio stream you would like to hear, WMP will not.
If there is some other reason you want to delete this track, inexplicable fear of directors or some such, then all I can suggest is nothing. 
Good Luck."
