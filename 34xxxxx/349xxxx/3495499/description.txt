You're about to take a ride of 45 minutes to the Medieval Epoch and feel the brilliantly created atmosphere of sorrow of these far away times, when children of North Nature, united with the forest and lakes,were violently, abruptly christianised. You can almost feel the souls screaming through the whole ride, which is that album... 

Naturally, the album is very good. Stylically this is pure black metal, old-schooled (i.e., not based on image or something like that, like some of mercenary "gothic"-looking heavy metal popular bands, but first of all based on a true SPIRIT), primitive as it may seem for a first time, but extremely beautiful in its Northern Atmosphere. Don't be mistaken, REAL black-metal is NOT all "screams and blast-beats"; listen to this album and you will understand why. Heavy riffs are going here perfectly well with medieval pipes and acoustic guitars.
