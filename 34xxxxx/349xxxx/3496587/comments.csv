Finally I?ll complete this nice collection. This is the ultimate pop/rock Library!!!
Very useful...if your remember some popular music, IT IS PROBRABLY THERE.
Browse it by year, and try not to remember people, places or facts of your life... 
GREAT!

BTW, if U don't know yet, try MP3TEST. Very handy!

Thanks again.
Long Live P2P!

Svensk og Dansk utenom Norsk går som regel greit. Det kan være noen uttrykk som ikke alltid er like enkle å tolke..... Heia Norge."

,snowhow,2007-03-30T02:31Z,"This is a really good compilation. Thanks!

PLEASE NOTE:

 A LOT OF THIS MUSIC APPEARS TO BE ""ALBUM VERSIONS"" AND CONTAINS VERY GRAPHIC LYRICS!!! IF YOU ARE IN THE U.S., THIS IS *NOT* THE RADIO VERSION OF THESE SONGS!!!"
,proudamerican,2007-04-25T18:29Z,"DIRTY VERSION!

Other than that, great collection.

Thanks. "
,adam917,2007-05-25T22:09Z,"Some of these lists appear to be in different positions compared to the Billboard torrents that were on here around 2004/2005. Example: Whitney Houston - I Will Always Love You was #1 for 1992, and Jon Secada - Just Another Day was #4 in 1992. Where were these lists aquired from?

I should get that book called ""Pop Annual"". It has tons of Billboard lists. At least this list fixed the 1991 #68 & 86 confusion (they were both the same song in the old torrent).

Anyone here know if it's worth re-downloading all of these again? I got the old material and some tracks are in pretty bad quality. I wonder if anyof them were fixed or replaced.

Anyone plan on uploading a lossless (like FLAC, WavPack, Monkey's Audio, etc) version of this set?

Thanks for the sets again, as always!"
,koeriksen,2007-06-23T12:31Z,"When I started this work for some years ago, I actually buy some of the list at Billboard. The problem was that even thei lists was the several wrong info in. 

There were misspelled artists, song names, and probably wrong positions. I remember there was 1 song 2 places in the list. I can't say the list is perfect, but I have spent several ours to do my best. 

You should be happy that I didn't know how much work this was when I started it (I would probably not started then).

I think the list is good, and I am happy for all the good comments. If you are happy, I am allso.

Best regards

,3bord3,2007-08-06T18:31Z,Keep it up! Like these torrents very much!

,augupes,2008-03-31T05:15Z,"Plz seed, it´s too slow."
,antonio00,2008-04-03T04:45Z,"Hi everybody, congratulations for this great file, is the real repository for the history of the music. About the question of files availability, I've noticed this point: When a file download is over and you change the directory or the disc where you file is stored at your computer, it's impossible for my client (utorrent) maintain several directories for uploading (at the new access) and downloading (with the old -common- directory). Is any solution available? To change the client? Any trick for utorrent? Obviously solving that, the availability of files for exchange will increase exponentially.

Thanks. Greetings from Spain."
,DADDYNJ,2008-04-07T05:28Z,Check Files Again I Some Corrupt Files and It Shows My That The File Is Bigger Then what Is Downloading WTF MAn sorry to be a pain but you state that its good and im getting fucked up files lol

,Shanefpt,2010-09-04T21:57Z,"Hey Koeriksen! Haven't began my download yet, but it is cued, I need to seed up the others a little first, and I was already blown away by the quality of the other uploads, so I am going to thank you for the upload and say GREAT TORRENT! In advance... Hopefully the seeds are a little more in the giving spirit on this one. LOL!"
,funky89,2011-02-27T20:48Z,"some of the later songs, once you hit the 2000s, have real bad quality."
