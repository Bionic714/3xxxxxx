The 7th Guest (1993)
--------------------

In the dawn of the CD-ROM era, a little known company named Trilobyte sets off to develop a software that aims to harness the capacity of the CD-ROM to deliver the multimedia capability of the home computer. The end result is the apparent market hit called The 7th Guest. With its incredible graphics and sound effects, The 7th Guest has been considered by many to be the "killer app" that set off the CD-ROM market.

Countless CD-ROM drives have been sold bundled with this software to show off the capability of the device. Yet, to many veteran gamers who see through the hype it has generated, The 7th Guest mounts to little more than a disjointed collection of classic logic puzzles disguised in pretty packages. Whether this title should be praised for its achievement or damned for its failure, there can be no argument that The 7th Guest has written itself onto a page in the computer gaming history.

Included files:

t7g_win32.zip - Windows version installed and ready to go.

Just unpack to a folder of your choice, mount the CD1 iso (or burn and place it in your cd-rom drive), and double click the "The 7th Guest" shortcut. Press Alt+Enter to toggle full screen. And yes, you have to watch the whole intro before you can play. No way to skip (doh!). When the intro ends remember to save.

There is no music during the intro credits when you play using a mounted cd image. Otherwise there is no difference as far as I know.
