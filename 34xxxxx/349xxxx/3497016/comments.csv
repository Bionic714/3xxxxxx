,bart09,2007-07-15T22:07Z,"has anyone got the xp version of this game because i love this,when i first played it on the cdi."
,Boogeda,2007-11-29T13:52Z,"This game won't work for me.  When I try to run ""The 7th Guest"" shortcut in t7g_win32, I get a screen telling me to insert Disc 1.  Can anyone help here?"
,ajpos,2007-12-23T00:26Z,"Benficanok-
Just leave the download open after it reaches 100%. ""Seeding"" is when you're downloading at 0kb/s but still have the file opened by your torrent program.

delilahthewife-
""Mounting"" is when you trick you make a fake disc drive on your harddrive. It's called a ""virtual drive."" You may think of it as tricking your computer into thinking you have another CD-Rom drive. To learn to mount a disc, check out this link:

bart09:
I just downloaded this game and it is running in XP.

boogeda:
Read the download description! you have to mount the disc1ISO."
,charlz.33,2007-12-30T15:20Z,how do i mount the disc1 can u help?
,charlz.33,2007-12-30T15:28Z,is there any 1 who can help me play this game? 
,JuggaloTremor,2008-02-01T09:10Z,"oh wow!  the memories!  I remember playing this game when I was younger and couldn't figure out how to do the cake quest lol...ahhh, good times.  Thank you for the upload, great choice.  I will seed for as long as I have it on my computer!  Love this game!"
,JuggaloTremor,2008-02-03T03:14Z,"ok, I unpacked the whole thing, mounted the cd1 and click on the shortcut and it tells me ""D:\Download\Trilobyte\ID_T7G\v32tng.exe the specific path does not exist.
Check path, and try again.""  Any thoughts??"
,JuggaloTremor,2008-02-05T06:14Z,"so I' guessing either i'm being ignored or you just simply don't come on here any more.  Either way, I wish SOMEONE would tell me how to get this to work...i'm on VISTA if that matters.

~Tremor~"
,content_king,2008-02-21T22:44Z,"I am downloading this torrent now, I'll take a closer look at it once im finished, but Im guessing if your running VISTA and this game pre dates Win95, you might want to run 95/98 in vmware.  The original game ran only on DOS, years later they released it for Windows."
,Odessa44,2008-03-28T20:10Z,"Hello i want to play this game. I did wat bart said. I have downloaded the virtual cdrom but it still keeps asking for a disk please help me.

,dunklekatze,2008-03-31T03:09Z,"Not so much a comment, but a question... does anyone have this available for MAC? I had played this game as a child and now I'm wanting to try again lol "
,VeKTeReX,2008-05-21T01:11Z,"It says that the CD audio is on the CD2.ISO but to the best of my knowledge, ISO files cannot contain CD audio (usually a BIN/CUE combo for that).

Does anyone have the CD audio working here?"
,topmoxie,2008-05-27T23:33Z,How long does it take to up load a game like this
,topmoxie,2008-05-27T23:44Z,"I have the 11 th hour, better game than seventh guest, I will try to upload it"
,topmoxie,2008-05-27T23:45Z,Oh is there anything I need to do to it to upload it
,topmoxie,2008-05-29T04:33Z,cant make it work it wont intall the files to a folder
,eniwetok,2008-06-01T19:38Z,"OK... it installs from disk 2 (the t7g2 .iso).

I burned it to disk and get the installation window either using the Command Prompt or INSTALL.EXE. I pick a drive and folder and it says it needs to test video speed. At that point ntvdm.exe shows a series of errors that it doesn't support full screen. I hit ignor a few times and it crashes. I'm running vista and tried it in the Win95 compatibility mode. 

Any ideas? Thanks!"

,eniwetok,2008-06-02T16:23Z,"I haven't gotten it running yet but here's some leads. If this is a DOS version of the game then Vista owners will need a MS-DOS emulator like DOSBOX. It's free at

,Zombiess,2008-09-05T18:00Z,"Can anyone tell me what program I need in order to run the AT, B, CH, CR, DR, EK, D, DEMO, and so on and so forth files? Stupid Microsoft Groove wants to open them and I think it's giving the game some issues. I can complete the cake game, but when I'm almost to complete the ""cans in the cupboard"" game, the game has some stupid error and asks me to restart.

Thanks!"
,Zombiess,2008-09-06T16:09Z,nevermind. I found it out
,BayRaider,2008-11-03T15:18Z,"ive got the original game, its near impossible to install it on vista, it IS hossible however, i got it to work but allot of sound was missing..."
,edetech,2008-11-06T11:34Z,"This is puzzle gaming at its best. I remember most of the puzzle solutions but I grabbed it mainly because it is an old game that was lost in a house fire.  Not my house, I loaned it to my next door neighbor. 

I am running it under Win XP using the DAEMON Tools to run the iso. Thanks I will continue to seed."
,tjw1962,2008-11-18T04:43Z,"Cool, it works great on XP. I had forgotten how much i enjoyed this back in the day.

Thanks for the u/l"
,piratzee,2009-03-22T04:34Z,werd.  it works on me xp.  thx a bunch.  freaking can't wait to get playing now.  cheers fine sir uploader!!!
,piratzee,2009-03-22T05:16Z,well it keeps saying something like it needs to be restarted so it's getting frustrating.  something like windows dos 95 needs to shutdown and it says to press ok then it shuts down the game.  well it was kinda cool to see the game again anyway.  thx anyway
,fnords,2009-03-30T23:26Z,"Ok dudes and dudettes!
there is a Windows Version t7gwin or something you can use, or SCUMMVM, i rather to use the SCUMMVM, its more stable, it doesn't actualy support MT32 Music, but who cares of MT32?
SCUMMVM is available at:

btw, right click to skip the intro"
,GreenIZ,2009-06-18T07:48Z,HELP! to BayRaider or anyone using Vista: how were you able to get the update to install? I keep getting an error message directly after a system check during the installation and it shuts down telling me to install disc 2. Any suggestions? I got the rest to work ok so far.
,vbaby74,2010-03-15T17:55Z,I cannot get it to play in full screen.  Getting a DD_Initialize error from Windows 95 player.  Did anyone else have this?  Running on Windows 7.

,Zarod,2011-01-26T22:42Z,"I can say one thing about this torrent: The CD2 does NOT have the CDA track.  I know this for a fact because I have the original CDs and compared this torrent with the CDs.  Repeat, there is NO audio track.

The reason I looked up this title because I have the original CDs of this game and thought they were broken.  Turns out I was able to extract the data and burn backup copies."
,kohmei,2011-03-04T09:45Z,"The CDA audio tracks converted to MP3 can be found at http://gh.ffshrine.org/soundtracks/751

Name track 101 to track1.mp3 and 201 to track2.mp3, and add them to your t7g directory. Assuming you are using SCUMMVM (as you should be), the game plays flawlessly with full music on any SCUMMVM compatible platform. "
