,spyderc,2009-09-16T12:35Z,The video appears to be interlaced.. but it downloaded at 1.2MBps so no complaints on this torrent.  Thanks!
[T],Pylypas_von_Kanapes,2010-03-07T13:56Z,"Sad and cruel movie, but becoming vegan is too dificult task for me, even becoming  vegetarian would be some protest against culture and family traditions... However not the eating habbits are the most important. Animal treating becomes really cruel when consumptional values rule the world. Killing of other ""earthlings"" will always exist, but the degree, reasons and the ways, in what it is done now, are really inacceptable. Download this. It will make U to think..."
