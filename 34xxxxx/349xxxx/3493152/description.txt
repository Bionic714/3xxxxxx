I searched like hell to download this and when all else failed i searched like hell to buy this, but it seemed impossible to get a hold of. Eventually i magaed to but it and now i've ripped it and will share it with the world. (i'll upload season 2 if this one gets popular enough)

For those of you not familiar with this amazing television show, here's a bit of a description:
Animated, british sitcom about a bunch of dogs made of clay. Probably the best Aardman Animation ever produced. Hope you'll enjoy!
