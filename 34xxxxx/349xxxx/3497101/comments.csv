,uraphake,2006-06-22T03:48Z,"Your torrent file is malformed somehow. It gives the following error:
Error creating directory 'D:\(VipersDenForums.Com)[BIG TITS]BustyAdventures - kate
': Invalid argument
Other torrents here work fine. It does this whether I save the torrent or use it directly from the link here."
