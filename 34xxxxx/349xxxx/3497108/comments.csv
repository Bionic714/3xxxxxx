,Xeno2007,2006-06-21T18:04Z,THIS IS BEING UPLOADED BY JIMBOBJOEBOO. I'VE ONLY UPLOADED HIS TORRENT FILE BY HIS REQUEST AS HE CAN'T GET IT TO ACCEPT FOR SOME REASON
,Xeno2007,2006-06-21T19:57Z,"This upload may not start for a while, but stick around and Jimbob should get my e-mail linking to this and he'll start seeding it."
,Xeno2007,2006-06-22T18:01Z,My pleasure :) I've been looking forward to this as you know - and I never saw it when it came out. If you have any more probs in future just send me the torrent file like before. What message is it giving you when you try to upload it?
,Xeno2007,2006-06-22T18:04Z,I would have asked if you've changed the tracker announcements in the torrent as they changed recently. But I uploaded it exactly as you sent it and it worked OK from my end.
