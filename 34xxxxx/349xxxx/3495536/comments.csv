,kpilcher26,2007-03-20T21:45Z,"So stoked someone has made this available. Hope its seeded long enough for me to get the whole thing.  Amazing live D&B act, with live drums and precussion, if you ever get the chance go and see!!"
,-=MosD3f=-,2007-04-02T16:37Z,PLZ RESEED!!!! I WANT IT 2....!!!
,goliathnz,2008-03-12T01:18Z,"Hmm, me too! Maybe there should be an auto email sent to the previous downloaders asking for a reseed...or a way to view your PB account, where people are asking for re-seeds on stuff you have downloaded? That would be real handy...for me anyway.
GO Kiwi Music and spread it to the world!"
