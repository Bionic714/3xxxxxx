Please seed though :P"
,KMeist,2006-06-26T17:23Z,I am seeding.
,bgthigfist,2006-07-19T12:13Z,"This is taking me FOREVER to dowload, I guess because not that many people are interested.  I have to thank you because my son is a BO BO BO freak, and I couldn't find this ANYWHERE to purchase for him.  What player do I need to use to play the files, or are they ready to be burned to a DVD?  Thanks (I'm seeding what I've got so far)"

,tehflash,2006-08-16T04:16Z,This needs more seeders. Bobobo-bo-bobo is my new favorite show.  I can't get enough of it.  As soon as I'm downloaded I'm going to seed for a very long time to get the goodness out there.
,16BT,2006-08-21T01:29Z,"Thank you so much, I was looking for all of these. However episode 26 doesn't work. It doesn't play in Windows Media Player and when I convert it to another playable type it becomes half episode 24 and half 26. Is there anyway to fix that?"
,KMeist,2007-05-12T14:39Z,"16BT: Try using VideoLan client. I know all of these should load. That episode was problematic, and I believe that a small chunk at the end of the episode (probably the last frame or something small like that, the full episode should be there) got chopped off - not enough to notice, but enough to put WMP in a fit. VideoLan can handle it though, since it can re-index AVI files.

Either that, or something got corrupted during the download without it's hash changing. (Very unlikely)

As for seeding, I lag at 8000ms whenever I upload faster than 5kb/s now, for some reason. I think my router crapped out on me."
,Demonix SD,2007-07-20T21:35Z,"Bobobo has a total of 76 episodes.
We still need the rest!

KMeist - are you also collecting the rest of them? I've looked like crazy but can't find them online @ decent quality!"
,Ajb92,2007-08-02T20:42Z,KMeist:  I've had the exact same problem as 16BT.  The VideoLan player only shows the first half of episode 24 when I tell it to fix 26.  It stops fixing halfway through the process and gives me a 10-minute portion of episode 24.  
,kunnoichi,2008-06-06T06:16Z,Wow  this is up there with excel saga in sheer insanity and wonderfulness  oh man thank you so much for the dl  I wish I could find the rest!
