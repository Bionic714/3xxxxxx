It is back. The high quality Billboard list.
It is now four parts, where the fourth is 2005.
The three first are the same as before.
All songs from 1946 (the beginning of end year lists) and up to now.
Have checked the beginning and end of every song and replaced bad ones.
Every song contains Title, Artist, Year and Tracknumber (number in list).

Download and listen
Thanks for all good comments.
