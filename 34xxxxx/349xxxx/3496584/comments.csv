,Aussie,2006-07-05T02:39Z,"It's a shame when people go to all the trouble to make these over sized torrents available.

NO-ONE wants to seed them and now I uploading more then downloading and I'm stuck at 50%.

There are no seeds only leeches.............

Looks like we're wasting our time and band with........"
,MisterSmee,2006-07-24T05:10Z,"Well it's up to the seeder who has the whole file, when it comes to this you don't want the whole thing, just the songs you pick from it, so it's a lot more important to seed it for a while since it probably won't kill you're connection like if it's a giant movie image file where they got to get everything."
,Insoportable_levedad,2006-08-09T19:52Z,"Den bästa musiken på nätet!!!

,DADDYNJ,2008-04-07T05:29Z,Check Files Again I Some Corrupt Files and It Shows My That The File Is Bigger Then what Is Downloading WTF MAn sorry to be a pain but you state that its good and im getting fucked up files lol
,MrCalifornian,2008-11-07T00:45Z,Awesome - thank you sooo much! This is the only real way to have all popular songs. Seeding as long as I can before I have to transfer the files to my external hard drive (which is pretty soon because I only have like 10gb left on my laptop and I'm downloading the rest of the set now).
,Shanefpt,2010-09-04T21:38Z,"Great Torrent Koeriksen!!!

Your a real life saver pal! I'm a DJ in the Miami region and I just had $11,000 system get jacked from a bar! Lost all my music and was afraid I would lose work. Rigged up a supplemental system but am still waiting for the police to recover it with all my music (fat chance in that). Just know that your effort is feeding my three year old son until I can get everything replaced. Should make you feel warm and fuzzy or something... LOL! Seeded to 6.5 ratio, had to cut it off temporarily because I had to use the drive. Thanks again! Great upload!"
,Shanefpt,2010-09-04T21:50Z,"**DADDYNJ** (and any others with similar problems) - Sometimes when downloading large torrents like these (I have noticed it especially with MP3's on Vista systems) some files will show up either corrupt, or claim to have missing data (eg: won't play in WMP or shows 0 bytes in properties), I have found that in many cases, this is simply an error. Open the file in a GOOD (I use Adobe Audition, but Nero, Xilisoft, WinAmp, etc. should work also) media converter or editor, make sure your CODECS are up to date and export the file (into whatever format you prefer) and save. This should fix it. ;-) I haven't found any corrupted files in this list at all, so chances are, you are having a tranfer error or your torrent didn't complete properly, you could also redownload the torrent and select only the missing/corrupted files! Hope that helps!"
,propersina,2011-02-27T02:57Z,PLEASE...SEED this...SEED...Thanks
