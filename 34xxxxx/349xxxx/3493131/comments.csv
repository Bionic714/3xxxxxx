Thanks vodkaeye. your iso's  have work well for. Had plenty of hours of fun out of Monopoly

Best way to install on Xbox is to use ""XIT"",
""Xbox Iso Transfer"" ir takes the whole iso file and places it straight onto your xbox hard drive as if you had taken it direct from the disc.
Your Xbox needs to be chipped and  you need to know the ftp password usually User:xbox PW:xbox"
