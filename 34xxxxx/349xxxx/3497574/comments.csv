,El Jafar,2006-06-23T10:07Z,Is it even possible to understand this shitty code?!?
,El Jafar,2006-06-23T10:15Z,"However, good you show it so people can see it..."
[T],Cyberlord05,2006-06-23T14:05Z,"LMAO I think your right about the letter lol. Yeah and the code is written very badly :D

,rip256,2006-09-27T15:51Z,"I don't know how bad the code is, but i heard it is good quality on it :)

,Moogly3090,2008-06-12T00:58Z,or just get into ReactOS and download their full source ^^ they're emulating the whole windows OS or cloning it w/e and its all open source ;P
,ryuchao009,2008-08-17T02:43Z,"for anyone looking for the NT4 source code it's here: 

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4149808/Windows_NT4_source_code

lol and M$ says it's more secure b/c no one has the source...not anymore"
[V],lan3y,2009-04-11T23:27Z,"thanks for sharing.

this is good for viewing the source code.

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4812723/Notepad___5.3.1

this is windows 2000 source code.

the nt4 source code is here

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4149808/Windows_NT4_source_code

they are both good and clean.

,kurkosdr,2009-06-15T21:38Z,"** Awesome file!! Thanks a lot man, a lot! Everything from the leaked part of Windows 2000 source code is there.**

Things like:

1) The decades old files (and decades old functions inside) and the even older copyright noties in these files (ex Copyright (c) 1989  Microsoft Corporation - not kidding check it out youself!)

2) The comments describing the silly workarounds (or in ms terminology, 'hacks') the programmers did to bypass inherent flaws, such as ""HACK ON TOP OF HACK ALERT, we can't get the font size, so we 'll resize the window to get it"" or ""we are going to create a temp doc file to get around the problematic .ole support in Exchange""

3) Priceless comments on the ""undocumented features"" or in plain english, features and functions microsoft reveals only to it's friend companies (symantec etc), comments like: ""These undocumented messages are used by Excel 5.0"" or ""This thunk implements the undocumented Win3.0 and Win3.1 API GetCurLogFont (GDI.411). Symantec QA4.0 uses it."" or ""This is a major undocumented find""

--> HERE is a list on WHERE exactly all this hilarity (and some other) is located: http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2004/2/15/71552/7795

Download and enjoy.

If the source code is the mirror of the person who wrote it, then all these 'ugly hacks' (as they themselves say) will most certainly result in a bad picture in the mirror for ms programers..."
,ntoskrnl,2009-11-27T21:37Z,@El Jafar: Show us some of your code then.
,crybaby95,2011-04-03T20:54Z,the full 100% windows 2000 source code is like 40gb.
