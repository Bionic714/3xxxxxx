,TizMagic,2006-06-07T18:07Z,"Ok, it worked this last try -thanks for upping.."
,sabaal,2006-06-07T22:03Z,"Quick note to downloaders: If there are no seeds connected, it's probably because my psuedo-server machine has lost its rather touchy connection and I haven't noticed. Leave a message here, and I'll try to get it back up within 24 hours."
,Wh1teshark,2006-06-08T21:14Z,"This is an exellent book, and a great recording of it. Allready have it but i urge everyone to dl it."
,anders_and,2006-06-09T16:34Z,"wonderful book, thank you!"
,friendinneed,2006-10-15T08:06Z,"erm, you said that if the download isn't working that any downloader should leave a message, so here I go... could you please restore that server? thanks"
,sabaal,2006-12-08T17:54Z,"Unfortunately, I've managed to break my machine, and I've lost the original data myself. If anyone's still looking, keep an eye open over the next month or so. I'll try to rip a new copy (hopefully to OGG, but no promises), and perhaps move on to the other two books in the trilogy."
,7yearwinter,2007-04-17T10:58Z,"Anyone for a very old reseed, I'd appreciate it."
