Here's some info:

The Hyper Utility software, converts RAW data into 16-bit TIFF data without any loss of detail that normally occurs with standard JPEG compression. The software provides a variety of image control and compensation parameters for data conversion. A unique feature of the Fuji Hyper-Utility is the ability to increase the dynamic range of the image and still retain all of the detail. This is very useful for portraits, commercial photos, graphic arts printing and other images requiring high picture quality.
