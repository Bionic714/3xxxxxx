,faslane,2008-03-26T15:42Z,"Forget it, unless you want the making of DVD, this is NOT the concert, just interviews etc.

Damn it, it's still great quality, but not the DVD with the videos and concert.

,faslane,2008-03-26T15:57Z,"Quality is EXCELLENT BTW!!!!

Faslne

interviews, not concert or vids!!!!"
,faslane,2008-03-26T16:35Z,"OKAY, I'm not sure if Pink Floyd DID release a live concert of Dark Side of the moon...can someone correct/help me here, this howeever is the interviews from the band members etc. not the ""Making OF"" I don't think, It's excellent quality so I'm seeding like crazy for a few days at least, this is certainly a must for any Fan or collector.

Thanks to the Uploaded!!!! Greatly Appreciated.

,deadjerryhead69,2009-05-03T20:17Z,"seems like this is not synched up right.  
dark side of the moon should be started at the second roar of the MGM lion before the opening credits start.  this starts a few seconds too late and kinda throws it off. still a good effort but not synched perfectly. if you have the old VHS copy, or an updated DVD of the wiz, try starting it the way i described above. 
   also, the first tracks are not set the controls or echos. the title of the song (noises) before breathe, is called ""speak to me"". just had to add that in.
still, this is awsome. i am 1 of the few who will continue to help seeding for at least 2-3 weeks, maybe a month. 
thanks a bunch for this."
,ENIXDIED,2010-09-20T21:18Z,thnx dude i will seed this forever.
