i have converted a move (demo mode) and i installed everything on a emty sd-card and i start up my tomtom and the movieprogram starts but my movie is not in the list, i have tryed with several movies.

I have a tomtom go 300.

anyone had any success with this program?"
,t3hm0d,2006-06-12T01:11Z,"Works on my tomtom GO 500 no problem. it degrades the firmware on your SD card back to 5.201 (if you upgraded higher like me), though, so make sure yer using a ""backup"" card.

Dunno if it's really useful enough to keep, i couldnt modify the volume setting as it just screamed ""restricted demo version"" over the display. "
,RedTiger,2006-06-12T14:31Z,"I tryed to degrade the firmware and i also tryed to using another sd-card but with no success.

so i dont know what the problem could be.
i tryed to just copy and paste a movie on the card and that movie showed up on my tomtom but when i tryed to play it my tomtom hangs."
,RedTiger,2006-06-12T14:48Z,"I tryed with a dvd-movie and that worked.

no its just to wait for a full version of this program"
