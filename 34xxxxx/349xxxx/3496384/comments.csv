,H_A_N_S_E_N,2006-06-29T12:37Z,Why is it this french shit every single time - we need some english instead!
,ploplo,2006-06-30T17:13Z,"To H_A_N_S_E_N :

1 - You could be polite, can't you?

2 - If this torrent description is in french , it could mean that the software described here is a french version (don't you think?). So it is only aimed at french speaking people... And an english description would be useless. 
(by the way it is written ""French"" in the title, so you know that's a french version and that you don't need it)

3 - The philosophy behind peer to peer is to share and provide digital content to everyone. From this point of view, that's a good thing to have torrents available in many different languages."
