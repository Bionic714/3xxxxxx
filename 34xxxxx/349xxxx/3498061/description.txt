this is a usefull windows system tray application
it allows you to place things like windows media player in the 
system tray.

I made an installer put the main trayit folder on drive C:\ and double click
the installer batch file.AFTER READING THE READ ME TEXT DOCUMENT!

note this is a freeware app I just made an installer for it.
the program starts with windows. the 1st run you will get a popup after that you wont
see the app it will start silent.
