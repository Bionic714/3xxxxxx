,anonymous2012,2006-06-25T04:38Z,"it is not a virus dumbass ,I have this on my own system! which has the latest greatest symantec anti virus. Right click the batch file click edit and look.
every effort was made to ""echo"" or tell you what was going on in the install process.
             YOU REALLY SHOULD INSPECT THINGS BEFORE SHOOTING OFF WARNINGS ABOUT VIRUS."
,El Jafar,2006-06-25T09:13Z,Sounds more like a small useful program to me than a virus.
,anonymous2012,2006-06-25T15:28Z,"doesn't matter I am no longer seeding it I was going to post an in depth view of what happens during install but the message throws an error.
  Everything I ever uploaded here is quality stuff used on my own system not to mention tested thuroughly."
