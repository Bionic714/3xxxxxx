,mikeh420,2007-02-09T06:44Z,"thanks a lot for this one. 

Went to a preview in Hollywood when this was released in 1987, got my name on the record sleeve of the LP (vinyl record), also LP was missing Dogs In The Midwinter, killer song..."
,zensan,2007-11-30T21:20Z,Thanks. 'sbeen a long time...This' the definitive album in the long jazz blues rock journey
,yepmatt,2008-07-08T10:09Z,"You want a medal, mikeh420? No, just kidding, feeling sassy. Tis a good album. Is ""Dogs in the Midwinter"" available elsewhere? I am not very versed in the Tullology. Or the Jethrology. The Tulliverse. "
,nothingreallymatters,2009-12-09T06:58Z,This is Tull's definative album. May I say more?Is 2005 Master any better than the original?
,nothingreallymatters,2009-12-11T00:41Z,Definitive? Well almost ...some may disagree...
