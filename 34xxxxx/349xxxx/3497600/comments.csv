""There is a difference between astronomy and astrology. The first is a science and the second is bullshit that looks like the truth... Please, show some healthy disrespect for everything you hear...""

1.)
The science of astronomy and the bullshit of astrology used to be 100% integrated.

2.)
Many people don't believe in astrology as any form of ""science"" but have a lot of fun with it, all the same.

Therefore, I'd say show some respect for fun, and more importantly show some respect for those who do believe in astrology.... I don't believe in a deity, but I still show respect for theists. :)"
