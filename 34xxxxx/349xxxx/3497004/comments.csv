,bps_73,2008-12-06T11:16Z,"I've been on 39.9% for quite a while now, and not a seeder in sight!

I'll keep seeding after I finish, but if I can't complete then what's the point?

Come on you leeching hit-and-runners! Have a care, the name of the game is to share!"

louise, I'd be real grateful if you could give us a boost! :)

Hopefully you get to read this soon!

Thanks in advance, and have a Happy New Year!"
,bps_73,2009-01-19T07:37Z,"Hi louise,

I'm still stuck on 61.1%, and there are no seeders, and according to ABC Torrent, only 10 leechers...

Can you please help?
