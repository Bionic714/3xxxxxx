,Sasdie,2006-09-10T16:03Z,"Why won't somebody seed this torrent? It has all  the books, while the other torrent misses two : 'Earthbound' and 'Houses of the Fallen'!! Pleease.. some people should seed this, because there's no other way to get these two books.. :("
,SoundWav3,2006-09-23T11:26Z,"can anybody please seed this?
I'll seed for quite some time if someone just lets me download it"
,Ambyant,2006-10-02T05:01Z,"What's the point of even listing this?  0 downloads!
 and it's supposed to be so good too.
 hey student babe, get online so I can learn how to be a righteous Demon!!"

,magoo64,2007-07-25T18:54Z,"I've been stuck at 99.9% for a few days. If someone could seed the last bit, I'll pay it forward for others."
,cyrrian,2007-09-30T22:42Z,Seed please and I'll seed too.
,cyrrian,2007-10-01T06:35Z,"Seed please! it stopped at 99,99% @_@"
,Geise,2008-08-08T12:53Z,"256K. That's how much I need to complete this torrent. I've been sitting at %99.99 for a week now. I've uploaded easily 2.1, will someone with that last bit please seed? It'll take all of a second and everyone will have it. Thanks."
,Geise,2008-08-08T13:12Z,"I think I may have found another torrent with the Fear to Tread booklet, one of the two missing ones. If this proves to be the one we need I'll add it and seed etc. After that I'll go looking for the Earthbound one. :)"
,Nevinryal,2008-10-28T07:24Z,"Nevinryal here, Good to see there are still some who keep this going strong, also I have Trilogy of the Fallen and am going to upload it soon it's a later series based on Demon: The Fallen, good books btw hope you all enjoy. It's my own way of thanking you all for letting me get ahold of Demon:The Fallen. Thank you!"
,VTMLARP9,2008-11-14T19:54Z,"I guarantee that this file is no where near comprehensive in it's list of books but Earthbound is highly essential. Two other books that would be wonderful to acquire would be 10,000 Hells and Days of Fire. I  look forward to the countless years of converting the table top format to the mind's eye theater format. I wish that I had a complete version of this file so that I would be able to seed for the rest of the people in the world who honor the old World of Darkness. "
