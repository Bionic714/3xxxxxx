---The Gamers\\\' Benchmark---
3DMark┬«06 is the worldwide standard in advanced 3D game performance benchmarking. A fundamental tool for every company in the PC industry as well as PC users and gamers, 3DMark06 uses advanced real-time 3D game workloads to measure PC performance using a suite of DirectX 9 3D graphics tests, CPU tests, and 3D feature tests. 3DMark06 tests include all new HDR/SM3.0 graphics tests, SM2.0 graphics tests, AI and physics driven single and multiple cores or processor CPU tests and a collection of comprehensive feature tests to reliably measure next generation gaming performance today. Futuremark\\\'s exclusive Online ResultBrowser web service tracks and compares 3DMark06 scores.


---Availability---
3DMark06 is available as a free Basic Edition with standard Online ResultBrowser functionality. The Advanced Edition is restricted to home/personal use only*, and offers expanded features, a playable mini-game and Pro-Online ResultBrowser access. The Professional Edition for all commercial uses includes all Advanced Edition features, plus command line scripting functionality, full control over all tests, looping game demos and full publishing rights for 3DMark scores.

---Minimum System Recommendations---

    * Intel┬« or AMD┬« compatible processor 2.5GHz or higher
    * DirectX┬« 9 compatible graphics adapter with Pixel Shader 2.0 support or later, and graphics memory of 256 MB minimum*
    * 1GB of system RAM or more - 1.5GB of free hard disk space
    * Windows┬« XP 32bit operating system with latest Service Packs and updates installed
    * DirectX┬« 9.0c December 2005 or later
    * Microsoft Excel┬« 2003 or XP for some 3DMark functionality
    * Microsoft Internet Explorer 6 for some 3DMark functionality
    * Microsoft DirectX 9.0c (December 2005) System Development Kit is required to run the image quality test using the reference rasterizer. 

* To run the HDR/SM3.0 graphics tests, a DirectX 9 compatible graphics adapter with support for Pixel Shader 3.0, 16 bit floating point textures and 16 bit floating point blending is required.

It is possible that 3DMark06 will run on PCs that do not meet the recommendations above, but the benchmark performance may be seriously affected. For example, insufficient video memory will result in texture swapping - this will cause fluctuations during the tests, reducing the reliability of the generated scores.
