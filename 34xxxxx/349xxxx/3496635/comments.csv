Seen it before though and it's pretty interesting. Beats Ramo any day."
,Kiko19,2006-06-25T13:13Z,SUbs:Just open the link and download. You will get a Winrar file. Unrar and you will have two srt files.  NOW my question is how the hell can i use these two srt files ???
,1057,2006-06-26T22:14Z,"cheers kiko :)

i use mac os and i wasn't thinking about how this os opens files in windows. when i clicked on the link using firefox.... all went well.
(i promise i am not chromosomally-challenged :D)

,1057,2006-06-26T22:18Z,"to answer your question: first you need to place the .srt files in their corresponding video folders. then you only need a video player that recognizes .srt files. 
my personal preference is vlc. unfortunately, my first prob with vlc arose when trying to watch this very film, as it seems there is a bug related to autodetection of subtitles in the current version.
luckily, they have an unofficial version available that fixes this prob. i downloaded it, and the subtitles are working perfectly now. 

you can dowload it here:

i hope this helps."
