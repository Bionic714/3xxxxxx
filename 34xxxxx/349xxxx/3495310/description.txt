          Proper reason: Well where to start...it would be easier to just
          mention the few things that aren't wrong with Crimson's release.
          They completely screwed up their segmenting shit, several scenes
          are repeated. In total their release is 111 minutes long,
          so there are 28 minutes of "bonus" scenes. Check our sample folder
          for one such a repeated scene, 4400-scene1.crimson.avi starts at 49.19, 
          4400-scene2.crimson.avi starts at 1.15.07.
          There are also segments that are out of sync and
          some segments have been encoded with a bitrate of around 150 KB/s.

          We would like to thank Crimson for providing the perfect example why
          segmenting needs to be banned. This is one of the worst releases i have 
          ever seen. We have cut one of the repeat scenes from their release to show
          what these groups try to get away with: 4400-scene1.crimson.avi and
          4400-scene2.crimson.avi are both from their release, they both show the same
          scene, however -scene1 has a bitrate of 726 Kb/s while -scene2 only has
          158 Kb/s. How can this be since both scenes are identical? Seems they
          had to encode one segment "a bit lower" to fit and the result is we get
          COMPLETE AND UTTER CRAP. How can you even think of releasing a TV show
          with a bitrate of 158 Kb/s ? You can if all you care about is releasing
          before anyone else and don't give a shit about quality at all.

          BAN SEGMENTING.

          And for those who think our release is undersized:

          This is a DSR and as we know The 4400 is usually dark.
          Undersized is not a flaw in this case. It is undersized because the file
          is perfectly saturated.
          For those who care, here are the Frame Quality Statistics:

          DRF=1&2:         77544 65.3%

          AverageDRF: 2.68

          Since the source resolution is only 544, there isn't much sense in upping the resolution.
          We increased the audio bitrate to 160kbps, but we refuse to use quant1 just to fill up to
          the standard size.
