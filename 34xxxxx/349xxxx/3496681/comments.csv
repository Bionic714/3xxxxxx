,Mr_Ecks,2006-06-20T12:00Z,"!Yo, hombre. Eso una site scandinavico. Par svedese y par englese. Por favor!"
,Mr_Ecks,2006-06-20T12:04Z,Don't be to harsh on him...  It has English as spoken language. But I do agree. This is a scandinavian site. English is the desired alternative. Or a scandinavian language. But allways post a English abreviation. 
,Muhaja,2006-06-20T17:31Z,"It's an international site, he can upload movies in any language he likes. Take it or leave it and stop complaining."

There r 3 public torrent sites in SPAIN !!!! If they want to share spanish spoken movies they can do it there! Piretabay is now fucked up with all kind of shit. Before the police raid, and all the publicitythey didn't know that it existed. 
This site is for us who lives in skandinavia,and by that i mean the movies should come with scandinavian sound or subs (besides english)"
,pilobash,2006-06-20T23:51Z,"I meant NORDIC when i wrote skandinavia, sorry for that my neighbourly brothers."
,speakeasy,2006-06-21T01:00Z,This is TPB - live & let live

No, this is an international site even though it's based in Sweden. If you want swedish audio/subtitles enforced on all movies you should visit Swebits."
,Spacker,2006-06-24T00:33Z,"Blimey - what a friendly bunch you are. Cheers uploader - it's a great film, and it's free. "
,waiti,2006-06-27T11:39Z,"al proximo sueco, danes, noruego o lo que sea que venga por canarias y no sepa hablar español le voy a decir lo mismo: En este sitio sólo se habla español nada de lenguas nordicas. ¿Te gustaría eso? Pues a mi tampoco que digan que no se admite el español..."

[T],minOdroL,2008-02-17T13:25Z,"Dont be foolish, of course the pirate bay is international. Only an ignorant Swede would believe  it's only for scandinavians :p"
[T],minOdroL,2008-06-07T15:04Z,"I've uploaded a multisubs retail DVDR of this here:
