You believe me, don't you?"
,aitchar,2006-06-07T17:51Z,register to see what I'm missing no a 404 error torrent
,twindad,2006-06-07T17:57Z,Nice - once again someone ups a torrent - then doesn't bother to seed
,Tauro,2006-06-07T21:38Z,"No this is kinda strange. At TPB stats are no seeder and no leechers.
But I definitely seed, I'm connected to 67 leecher and have already uploaded 1,2GiB,
Could somebody tell me where the error is?
TIA!"
,speakeasy,2006-06-07T22:23Z,"Actually, once again someone ups a torrent and nobody says thanks.

1) I don't know the reason for the 404 errors, but if you retry a few times, they eventually work.  Maybe try  on the link and say 'Open in new window'

2) No seeder?  This is seeded just fine.  Just let the torrent sit there in you client for a while.

3) Lame link?  Maybe . . .

Thanks for the post Tauro"
,Tauro,2006-06-07T23:26Z,"Thanks for the kind words mate.
As to 3.:
Don't know, all I can say it that Cassandra is am active member there.

However, it still is strange. Can't connect to my torrent anymore. I've tried to dl the torrent file again, but I get a 0kB file.

If somebody should have the same problem, or the seeding should not be completed, please reply and I'll re-seed the file, no problem."
,Rackhams,2006-06-08T00:25Z,Seems to work okay. Please upload when you got it down folks !. Thx for the torrent.
,funkydom,2006-06-08T20:30Z,"I can't believe who much people can complain about a free service.  Tauro doesn't have to upload shit but he has anyways, and he even put up preview pics.  So how bout some god damn appreciation for this man!

P.S. if you read the blog here they say that the seeders/leechers/download counts have been at zero for the past two weeks. So get over it."
