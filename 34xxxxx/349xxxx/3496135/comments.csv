,Whitefoot,2006-07-27T00:51Z,So Big Thx :) 
,graeme6630,2006-08-25T12:04Z,"Thanks for uploading this torrent.  The other one, ""Sonic SatAM Complete DVD Collection"" kept me at 99.9% for four weeks. This only took me a day to download. But, now it Seeding, even though the download is complete. 

I have just one question: How long will this seeding take until I can watch the episode, or put them on DVD?"
,Kientero,2006-09-22T11:14Z,"Hmm... I downloaded these episodes, and I realised that this version is from the old *.rm quality files that I downloaded years ago, and so is the other version that every episode has variable video & sound quality but the episode ""Sonic and the Secret Scrolls"" is incomplete and sometimes chashes the player or makes a ugly jump ahead. So I stick to the one that probally takes me weeks to get hold on.

Kientero, signing out..."
,JooiZe,2007-03-03T12:54Z,"graeme6630: Great that your seeding, many people don't.. But just pause the torrent and do what you want with the files, then you can start it again. :)"

Can you put the adventures of sonic the hedgehog episodes too please???? :D"
,Emblache,2009-08-03T11:53Z,"I downloaded this torrent and when i opened it i had 18 copies of each episode? Anyway the quality isnt great, but it is watchable and my kids will love it :) Good work"
,luciferis,2010-02-06T18:08Z,"All the eps are there. There are 2 to 3 eps in each rar file so thats why it only shows 18 rar files or whatever. U will need Winrar or something else to extract the eps. The only problem is that these eps are in TERRIBLE quality. No  disrespect to the uploader (thanks for doing this), but for me personally, I find it unwatchable. Of course, this is one person's opinon so think for yourself..."
,c_air_07,2010-02-16T14:46Z,"Wow, thanks...I'll be seeding this one for a good amount of time.

Anyone have a link to the other Sonic series - Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog?  Also Super Mario World?

Thanks!"
