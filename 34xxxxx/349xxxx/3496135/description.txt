                                 Release Notes
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I take no credit for this release, other than to expand the bandwidth capability 
of this collection to the bittorrent community for one of the highest quality 
cartoons to ever be put into production. I did not have any involvement in the 
capturing, encoding, or initial distribution of this set of video files. 

This torrent was uploaded and is seeded because of the death of the "Sonic SatAM 
Complete DVD Collection" torrent, which kept the community at 99.9% distribution 
for several months. In response, the community now has access to the origonal 
files used in the DVD production through THIS torrent. If you want to support 
the Sonic SatAM fanbase, return the favor and seed. Don't let this die too!

These are the origonal files that are commonly seen slopply converted to mpeg2 
for use in DVDs on eBay. Currently this collection contians the highest quality 
episodes you will find on the internet. If DiC, ABC, or whoever decides to 
release an official DVD collection, don't download this, buy the boxset! In the 
meantime, contact your local Sega, DiC, or Disney representative and ask to give 
us fans what we really want: a official DVD boxset. DVD sales have ressurected 
many shows, we can hope for nothing less. Join a Sonic SatAM fansite and do your 
part!

From Wikipedia:
Sonic the Hedgehog is an American animated television series that was created by 
DiC, and aired from September 18, 1993 to June 3, 1995 on ABC. In contrast to 
the comical Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog released almost simultaneously, 
this cartoon features a darker setting and deeper, more involved story lines. 
Also, it was based on the comic book series more than the game. To distinguish 
between the two series, fans typically refer to this as SatAM, because it was a 
Saturday morning cartoon, while Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog aired on 
weekdays in syndication. DiC was planing on making a third season of SatAM when 
ABC decided to pull the plug on the show because of low ratings (the show with 
the highest ratings at the time was Power Rangers) and also because the 
president of ABC at that time simply disliked the show.

From TV.com:
"Sonic the Hedgehog," also known as the SatAM (Saturday morning) series, was the 
second television program to star the famous video game icon. It followed the 
slapstick "Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog," which was known mostly for its 
lighthearted approach. The SatAM, however, took on a much darker tone, telling 
the story of Sonic and his brave band of Freedom Fighters as they struggled to 
free their home world, the distant planet of Mobius from the clutches of the 
evil Dr. Robotnik. 

The first season was an unconventional mix of cartoon characters and a grim 
setting. Characters were developed and mature themes were explored. The second 
season, on the other hand, lightened the tone considerably, emphasizing the more 
comedic aspects of the show and toning down the series' darkness considerably. 
The show ultimately ended on a cliffhanger after only two seasons due to 
underachieving ratings. However, this was not the end of the SatAM.

The series developed a cult following over the years resulting in countless fan 
fiction stories and discussion that kept show alive several years after it had 
been cancelled. Additionally, the Archie comic book adaptation of the "Sonic" 
character began to modify itself to more closely resemble the SatAM series and 
remained in publishing ten years after the show had been cancelled. Furthermore, 
the SatAM's influence was felt in additional Sonic adventures with various 
elements of the series being included in the "Sonic Christmas Blast!" special 
and the "Sonic Underground" series. The SatAM is generally agreed to be the most 
popular of the American-made "Sonic" cartoons.
