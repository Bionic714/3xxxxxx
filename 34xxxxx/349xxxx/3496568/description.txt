# Morgenrot was the first film to start in the Third Reich, just three days after Hitler's seizure of power.

# The first German submarine movie after World War I.

# The Finnish submarine "Iku-Turso" was used in some scenes. Ufa (the production company) 
also purchased the Finnish schooner "Maria av Viborg" to be blown up as the British U-boat
trap in the battle scene.
