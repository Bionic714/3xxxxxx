,Th. Anatos,2006-06-23T21:28Z,"Thank you for this great upload.
I have it and am seeding away, but I was trying to convert the file and burn it to DVD and, while the picture looked great, I got no sound. I tried this with two different apps and also tried burning to VCD with the same result each time. I know I have the audio codec, because I can play the file on my computer. Has anyone else had this problem or might know why it's happening? Thanks!"
