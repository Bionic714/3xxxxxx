,isolatedvirus,2006-08-07T08:45Z,"not only does there need to be more seeding, but ive been downloading for days now and ive only gotten access to the highest, 5kb at a time. people need to open up thier bandwidth to uploads while they are downloading... i dont want this to take 90 days to download.."
,jazz2600,2006-11-04T09:07Z,"this torrent is updated every month on Demonoid with new books. hence the old one is deleted.

,Fluxxdog,2008-06-28T23:34Z,"Well, it's nice to see someone still seeding this after 2 years!  I think it's about time to start up the whole thing again in a couple months >:)"
,WonderSlug,2008-09-23T10:29Z,"Fluxxdog, thank you for continuing to seed this even more than 2 years later.

Also, thanks to the other seeders.  It's really great to finally find an almost complete DnD 3.5 collection.
"
,Varkrath0,2009-12-16T12:15Z,"big DnD fan, i only play 3.5 so i will probably seed this forever.  someone should let me know if there is a newer/better torrent for 3.5 books.  jackbw at gmail"
,thathobo,2010-01-13T01:19Z,"Someone, for the love of God seed.  I've been seeding for the last 3 days, and I'm still downloading but my down speed has been about 83 KB/s (KB, not MB) from just one dude in Finland.

If you have this, seeding would be appreciated, I will continue to seed."
,UnbalancedTime,2010-01-24T21:37Z,I should not be uploading faster than my download.  Stop being selfish pricks and seed (I don't care if you're on dial-up if you download; you seed).
,BPenguin,2010-04-28T21:16Z,"Currently DL at an avg. of 600 kb/s. Keep seeding, when I'm done I'll seed for awhile"

,VeeOt,2010-11-25T01:10Z,what no seeders at all active.  well this sucks.  been looking for a good rulebook collection since Wzards in their infinate stupidity took 3.5 off the market.
,vestha01,2012-03-15T03:46Z,"Unable to check on Demonoid, did the site were brought down by the FBI or something?
Invite if possible please."
