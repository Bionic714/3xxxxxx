,Ginta,2006-10-30T11:54Z,"How did he die?
He was rather young so it really was a shame for him to pass away.

And he had a rather mixed taste in music. Some is really shitty but some is great.

If you knew him, remember him."

,scaraus3,2006-11-28T00:19Z,"Life is short, but long in the living
Going forth on the uncertain paths of the future
Seeking an outlet, a path, in vein

There where that tunnel so familiar
And that wall banishing the light
Stifling forever the hope of better day
