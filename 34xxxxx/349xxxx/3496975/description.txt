Before the New Age genre started getting watered down by lighter and less adventurous music in the late 1980s, there were artists like Michael Garrison. The New Age artists from the late 1960s through the mid 1980s helped shape the genre with classic New Age Synthesizer music. Garrison's music is just one example of the classic New Age sound. Enjoy....
