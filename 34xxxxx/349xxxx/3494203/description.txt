A young Christian is humiliated after he attends a college philosophy club meeting filled with atheists. The club mocks his attempts to prove the existence of God, and now the unprepared student is out for revenge. After finding a mysterious paper written decades ago, he tries to ambush the next meeting by telling the students when the world is going to end and how it'll happen. When his scare tactics don't work, he struggles to understand why.
