More information would be welcomed... like who patched it... credits?"

,toppenkillen,2006-06-18T14:15Z,What's up with the .exe file format? Is it an installer? Why not distribute in a .zip? This .exe isn't a winzip self-x file either? Virus-/trojan-checked by anyone? I don't like to run .exe's just like that.. :(
,Dutchman01,2006-06-18T21:14Z,"It's i think a patched original windows patch.

no virus insite, you can extract it with winrar.

it works perfectly"
