,tomtomx,2006-06-11T23:35Z,What do you get when you take a bunch of mental patients with no concept of reality at all and put all their paranoid fantasies in the same movie. Well... A movie like this...
,kloaken,2006-06-12T02:46Z,"Yeah, it's pretty scary. However, David Icke, Ted Gunderson & Co. does a pretty good job exposing them.
Thanx CSKA! :)"
,Cyclops4ad,2006-06-12T22:42Z,Seed for god sake...
,filekÃ¤rring,2006-06-12T23:51Z,The seed is splendid. 300kps... Just the way it should be!! Good up ;)
,cleddau,2006-06-13T00:16Z,"You sad bastards. Has anybody listened to Icke? He is certifiable. A complete lune. Download, believe and then do the world a favour - kill yourselves!! At the very least get sterilised.  You stupid sick bastards should not be allowed to procreate!!"
,tomtomx,2006-06-13T01:15Z,"Hey, don't pick on Icke! Just because he actually believes that the leaders of the world are really an ancient race of blooddrinking shapeshifting lizardmen. The thing is - he's not any more deluded than the rest of the braintrust in this collection."
,havi,2006-07-17T10:15Z,where the heck are the seeders?
,69shots,2006-09-08T00:36Z,This is probably the most stupid thing I've ever tormented my eyes with. Does people actually believe in this load of crap??
,Osaka,2006-10-24T20:56Z,"Sleepstreamer, it might be a region issue or something with your TV. If the DVD is NTSC for example, a PAL TV might not display it correctly even if the DVD player is regionfree.

Try playing it on your PC with VLC Media Player."
,BiffBarff,2006-10-28T12:24Z,"""And the truth shall set you free..."" indeed. 
This is really a very good representation of what is going on in the U.S.A. Thank God for people that have the balls & the brains to speak out the truth. Many of them may have their issues, but what is said here, is truely a revelation of what the Hell is going on behind all our backs."
,Truthwalker,2007-06-13T10:45Z,Its really shocking to se all this hate against people who are conspiracy theorists. If they all are just wacko braindead people. Why dont you just leave them alone and let them believe whatever they want? It feels rather like this hate comes from fear that maybe they are right. Its easier to dismiss the message and live in a happy bubble.
,FUCKEMALL122,2007-11-25T20:24Z,"Agreed with the person above.

Even if you do not believe in the ""illuminati"" or the other conspiracy theories noted in this video, just take a look at your history books and see how hitler convinced hi people to go to war, and look who financed hitlers rise to power.

Maybe then you will understand what is really going on in America and the world today."
,paul_1980,2007-11-27T21:30Z,"@ truthwalker you couldnt have said it better. its easier to go about life without any harsh question to it or what rules it. we've got too much to worry about with our everyday lives. thats exactly how they(government) wants us to think, worried about the pointless shit in life while they control the world and the things that make our life harder but we cant see that because we're cought up in our own lives trying to work for shit that should be free like food, clothing, etc. this is a system that was created for us to reley on the government for a way of life. so i say fuck the system,fuck them up there stupid asses. its a bunch of people that use to get there asses kicked in high school that couldnt stand up for themselves so they learned how to muniplate people to do their dirty work for them but it just didnt stop in school. they masterd the art of munipulation and took it one step higher and now youve got a one world govenment j/k (maybe) anyways the new illuminati vol.3 documentry comes out today 11/27/07 and i cant afford it but i need to know whats going on if anyone can help me with a link or a download site to veiw it that would be great my email is paul_e1980@yahoo.com....thanx to anyone that can help!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
,gibsonnosbis,2008-01-28T18:44Z,"Listen; This movie is so very very un-factual and completely unbacked by Any evidence, that I would never call this a documentary.

As far as I am concerned, there should be a big warning at the beginning, stating this to be a complete work of fiction, except for the names of the leading characters."
,sim0b,2008-04-14T14:27Z,"Hi everyone, I need some help...! Im using Roxio 9 to burn my ISO downloads onto disc which works successfully if my downloads are ISO only. Roxio 9 doesnt seem to recognise AVI files etc! Does anyone know how i can burn AVI downloads onto disk??? What programme do i need ??? Im using utorrent which is good! Thanks everyone."
,VenomOfRivia,2008-05-16T19:18Z,aleister crowley wasn't a satanist. the race anunaki by the sumerians that were the first people described them ( the lizardmen from icke)  didn't even new the existence of satan because then the religion of jewism and christianity didn't existed yet. that the most polititians that rule the earth are really members of such kind societies (not necesery from the race anunakis that actualy are the gods from the sumerians and i have no idea if they were aliens) like freemassonry  and stuff. even the leaders of christianity are members of such things. i know a person that saw the old high priest from the greek church of christianity in a satanistic cult and i believe him as he himself was there and i know him well. and freemassonry are real christians and paganists they have nothing to do with satanism. so were and the templars. i have read the aleisters crowley biography his books and there was nothing satanistic in his words and acts. and if magic was an evil thing the god wouldn't have create it. like everything in the universe can be used as good an evil the same time. because you can not understand it that doesn't make us that use magic evil or satanists.
,crapshitname,2008-05-31T17:27Z,Mixing some truth in with pure nonsens doesn't make the whole thing true. Just too much shit to even make it close to belivable...
,GoldStandard,2008-08-01T11:40Z,"Icke is a bit disappointing.  Good presenter playing on emotions rather than facts.  If someone wants a better introduction to what Illuminati does look for Aaron Russo's America Freedom to Fascism.  It is the same people that are behind many of the central banks, inflation and depressions, unbacked fiat currency, drug smuggling, political assasinations, sponsoring of all parties in war, sponsoring of terrorism etc.  America Freedom to Fascism does not cover all these topics, but it is amongst the best docos on how they use legal and illegal ways, bribery etc to corrupt leaders of nations. 

If you specifically want to know more about the pozi scheme behind our monetary systems, also check moneymasters. 

You can probably find both on Google video (usually censored in youtube) if you can't get it via P2P. "
,krigern,2008-08-01T15:32Z,"""aleister crowley wasn't a satanist"" ?????
You for real???

if, ´people believe in this kind of bull...then i feel sorry for them, it most be terribly to live and believe al this things...""Poor People, almost like i feal pitty for them"""
,MFINN23,2008-08-14T17:02Z,"Fuck this guy, fuck Michael Moore, and fuck all like them.  All they do is prey on the young, gullable, and simple-minded.  Because of this crap that they call a ""documentary"" we are surrounded by whiny conspiracy theorists that do nothing but argue about issues they know nothing about.  Just because you saw it in a movie doesn't mean its true people."
,omegastar013,2008-09-01T21:57Z,what do you get when a bunch of evil christian oil tycoons get together? this is their story
,andoroo,2008-09-08T12:51Z,"do a research and then talk about it. you fools, lazy fingers, google it and don't even go to the mainstream media and take their bullshit. "
,C0RPSEGRiNDER,2008-10-12T03:16Z,"I agree with a bit of this shit but it is rather entertaining. Yes, I understand the government is evil but I draw the line when you bring satin into this. I think they are atheist. Maybe they are trying to take over the world but they aren't going to do it in one movement. They've been slowly introducing it to people over a long time."
,lizardking420,2008-11-12T03:51Z,"ILLUMINATI VOLUME 3 IS OUT VERY SOON!!!!!

,theloner81,2009-01-22T04:49Z,"To chudddds, why is it all blacks blame it all on the whites, your own people sold you into slavery. By no means do I aprove of what many white masters did to your people in the past, it was wrong and inexcusable, but in all honesty you should be thankful that we took you in and tried to educate you. After all, you could still be in mother africa, dumb as a stump with aids scratching your head wondering what the fuck happened. Get over it, and move on. If this offends anyone I am sorry, but the truth is a hard pill to take sometimes....."
,Ionize,2009-07-11T21:16Z,"why do people get upset and write such negative comments.  You don't have to believe, no is forcing you.  Perhaps denial that their values and beliefs are meaningless an people, especially dumb shit Americans are the most easily manipulated   It would be a  much safer world if fuckin idiot Americans were aremed with spears.
This video is especially for those who believe 19 sand niggers with box-cutters hijacked 4 jet airliners and somehow caused controlled demolition of WTC 1+2"
