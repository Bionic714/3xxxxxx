,Ganellon,2006-09-07T16:56Z,"This torrent was extremely well done. The package is very complete, the instructions are precise, and easy to follow.
My recommendation: be selective in your downloads, and take only the languages you need. Don't bother with the manuals; they are utterly useless.
As to the value of Rosetta Stone as a language learning tool, I must say that I was somewhat surprised at its approach. There is no translation whatsoever -- you are simply thrust into the language. You really have no way to know what they are trying to communicate apart from guessing, deductive reasoning, and referring to a translation dictionary. For example, you are shown a picture of a child, shown a foreign word, and treated to an audible pronunciation of that word. While this may seem logical, it is difficult to know if they are trying to convey ""child"" or ""boy"" or ""toddler"" or ""youth,"" and you will probably need that translation dictionary handy to help you along the way."

,bwb_75,2006-11-15T05:37Z,"bobuk or others that are having problems:

Extract the Application and run the 'autorun' or 'setup'

Extract the languages you want to a folder. Extract as many languages as you want to this folder, just keep in mind the size of the CD or DVD you are using. Check the chart shown in this torrent (or read the instruction files in the downloaded file) for what picture files are associated with the languages you put in that folder. Extract those picture file sets for the languages you extracted to the same folder.

Download a Magiciso or another iso builder.

Put all of those extracted files (they are folders like ENGB_021, not the folder containing all of these files) to your main folder you created along with the three .trs files into the iso building window. Keep in mind, depending on how many .rar language program files you extracted, this could be hundreds of file folders. (ie. I put all European languages on the same DVD, that equated to 109 986 files in 5 303 FOLDERS (3.93 GB)).

Save the iso.

Burn the iso you created to a disc or virtual mount it (I'm not explaining virtual mounting, burn it to a disc if you don't know).

Just put the disc in your CD/DVD drive, start the Rosetta Stone program, and it will recognize all of the language programs you put on the disc, regardless of how many language programs you put on the disc.

Learn away.

finally am able to make this work....
so this is how you need to make iso....]

extract all the rar files into a new folder....(donot extract  Application_V2.0.8.1, Application_V2.1.3A)
 extract only the language and Picture files....no matter how many language files you have downloaded.  and also copy those 3 .TRS file into tat folder...now your folder is ready to make iso....(donot make the iso of tat folder)

i used ultraISO to create my iso of the Rosetta stone.. now i made the iso of the contents inside the folder.....(root). then ur dvd/cd is ready to use...

now you install the application using autorun or setup.exe from the file Application_V2.0.8.1

now you mount the created iso in ur image drive. and run the application. now its will detect the dvd/cd tat you have created...

now you can start learning...

this is the snapshot of my ISO file created...
its working fine....

,Mashingo,2007-04-01T13:01Z,"Hi, I wrote the following comment just some minutes ago, as a comment to another torrent. I therefore paste it here as well. Maybe it can give an idea to somebody... (by the way, I have Japanese I and II...

- - - -

... If I knew how to share, I would. But I'll tell you how to make something nice: 
1) request a demo disc with the application, or download it from somewhere. The demo has the advantage that all languages' text files are there, as pdf's.
2) I have a lot of TRS languages already. So I opened each language disc and copied all files to a folder on my desktop. A huge lot of files are on each language disc, but I answered ""yes"" on every prompt about ""replacing existing file?"" in order to avoid duplicates and keep the folder size limited. (when I was uncertain, I added a dot on a filename and left both files in the folder. I don't think it was necessary - anyway they did not do any harm). In the end I got a huge folder, more than 4 Gb).
I started the application and had it look for languages, but that did not work.
3) So i started Toast (in my case, version 6.0 Titanium), put the whole lot there, and chose ""Save as a disc image"" under the file menu.
4) That disc image worked!!! So I burned a DVD disc, a magnum gadget with more than 20 languages, many of them in two levels.
It looks really nice when opening the application... 
I see no reason for not putting even more languages into it, except for the external DVD disc size. I guess that a disc image can be quite big if it is kept in the computor or on another hardware.
5) I have a G5 PPC and a G4 laptop. It works on both. I have not tested on a PC, but I can see the additional disc icon appearing, indicating the possibility.

6) I am not a computor freak and do not even want to know technical details, that is why I have Macs. I just tested this. So I don't know how to make a torrent, I don't even understand the language (peer, seed and so on).
But I will share the DVD I made, if somebody gives me VERY detailed instructions on how to do it!

I don't look for mail very often here, but I'm available on katerinamolotok(at)yandex.ru

It's just this torrent, and all other torrents dl fine @ 100 kb/s, so I have no idea what's wrong. anyways, my next concern is how effective this program really is. My college professor actually bought the rosetta stone french, and he lent it to me and I tried it, and it doesn't seem all that effective since it just randomly throws pictures at you and saying the picture in the language your trying to learn. I worked with the program (both levels I and II) and I didn't see much grammar or usage or anything of that sort. This seemed for like a picture vocabulary program. Can somebody who has more experience with the program comment?

,PokeHerPro,2007-05-26T14:13Z,"First off Id like to say thank you for this torrent.

OK now to all the people that had problems I really dont understand it. Within 24 hrs of seeing this torrent I downloaded it, installed it, and made three dvd's full of all the language files. I hade no problems what so ever.

The only things I even noticed that could hange people up is that both PCF01-08 and PCN01-08 rars where not packed like the rest. So if swahili or latin is not working for you here is the fix.

The file is packed inside a folder so if you unpack it like the rest of the rars instead of having many folders in the root directory you would only have one (PCF01-08(jpg) or PCN01-08(jpg) and like the instructions say everything has to be in the root dirrectory. I caught this right away and there was no problem.

The instructions were very clear and if you follow them there should be no problems. However if you are having problems feel free to e-mail me and I can assist. I installed on windows and burnt directly to disk. Although I did not do it I know that making an iso and running from HD will work just as easy. 


As far as the program goes it is not for everybody so if you dont know you want it download the demo from rosettas website or just download the program itself and one languge only to see if it is right for you.

Well just wanted to offer the help and to thank kattana for posting this great torrent.


P.S.    To the ass hole that called kattana a fuck-stick, You can suck MY dick. Dont bad mouth someone who is trying to help your sorry ass and take it out on them cause you are too stupid to follow easy directions to get it to work. The world would have been so much better if your mother would have just swallowed that one time."

,ntmurphy,2007-05-30T18:23Z,"Can someone seed an ISO file for the Hindi language pack?  When i make my own ISO from these language bundles, the app won't recognize them.  I'm following the instructions exactly.  I've tried burning to a disk, and also mounting to a virtual drive...  It only works for me when i download an ISO of the language."
,PokeHerPro,2007-05-30T22:38Z,"I can do that for you but first try this and it should work.

Burn A Disk and label it The Rosetta Stone

Extract the language and pictures files to a folder on the desktop.

Burn the files(not the folder to disk), So for the hindi language you should have 182 folders and three files in the main directory as follows.

PCT01_01          HIN01_01
PCT01_02          HIN01_02
PCT01_03          HIN01_03
ETC ETC            ETC ETC
Thru                  Thru
PCT08_12          HIN08_12

CATMPC.TRS
CDID.TRS
Credits.TRS

If your main directory looks like that and is labled The Rosetta Stone It will work.

I am assuming you already installed the application already. Now all you do is put the cd it wait for it to load then start the application and it will see the languages on the disk.

If this does not work me sending iso probable wont help cause it will be an iso of the same directory listed above.

I have followed kattana's instructions to the letter (I think) but still cannot get this program to run on my MacBook.  I have created both an image file and DVD with the language files (DEUXX_XX), image files (PCTXX_XX), the three TRS files (CATMPC, CDID, and Credits), and all the extracted files from the Application_V.2.0.7.toast image.  Is this correct or am I missing something?  Where or what is the application that gets this program up and running?  If possible, please contact me directly at townetj@verizon.net."
,wassupdoc,2007-06-22T17:17Z,"OK People after staring at the Instructions and reading through the comments and making the mistakes myself over and over I finally figured out what I did wrong and I think a few of you are making the same mistakes.  I'll start after you have downloaded the files you want/need:

1.  Make a new directory for example c:\espanol
2.  Extract the Espanol level I.rar to this new directory
3. Now look carefully at the table in the instructions.
4. See how Espanol level I matches up with PCT01..08 in the table
5. so Extract the PCT01..08.rar to the /espanol directory
6.  Now copy the three .trs files to the /espanol directory(CATMPC.TRS CDID.TRS and Credits.TRS)
7. So you have everything in the /espanol directory now that you need to burn/make an iso with
8.  Use your fave program( i personally like imgburn and its free)  to burn/copy all of the contents of the /espanol directory to the ROOT directory of the disc/img file.

9. Notice I said contents of /espanol directory. After finished burning when you insert your cd into the drive your root directory should have hundreds of folders.  NOT the /espanol directory

9. SO now your language disc is done.  You can mount/insert it into your cd drive. but you still have to install the program
I won't explain that part since most people have got that already.

Where I kept messing up was not looking at the table and assuming that everything i needed pict and text was in the espanol 1.rar.  I didn't extract the PCT1-8.rar.  Oh well

Now it works perfectly.  thanks OP"

,Ximpostrxx,2007-07-06T01:46Z,"Mac Users:

The instruction included in the .txt weren't very clear for me so I experimented and figured out how to make it work on my intel Macbook. Create a new folder on your desktop. Extract the language file(s) you want along with the .jpg(s) that go with it. Extract those files to the folder you created on the desktop. Then copy the 3 .trs files into the folder as well.
Mount the .toast file included in the torrent download. Within that .toast file there is another titled ""TRS Application Demonoid"".toast and mount that, that will mount 2 disks, the first on is for windows and is called ""App_Disc"" and the second is called ""TRS Application"" copy all the files from this disc into the folder with the languages on your desktop.

So now withn that folder you created on your desktop you should have:
1. Whatever language files you decided to use
2. The .jpg files that go with the language you chose
3. The 3 .trs files
4. All of the files from ""Application_V2.0.7.toast > TRS Application Demonoid.toast > TRS Application"" NOTE: You only want the files from the last Disc: ""TRS Application"".

After that download the program ""Disco"" (search google ""Disco Mac"")

Open Disco and open the folder you created on the desktop drag all of the contents of the folder (not the folder itself) into the Disco window where it say Drag or Drop. Insert a blank CD and go to preferences (apple+,) go to the tab called ""Burning"" and go to ""Disc Type"" and select ""ISO 9660"". Click the ""X"" to close that screen then click ""Burn"" and wait for it to burn. And if you haven't already installed the app install it now. when the Disc is finished leave it inserted and run the app. Everything should be recognized!"

Note re the pictures: the different sets are region-specific, and a few are quite different.

*Rosetta Stone does not sell a product with ALL the languages.  THe only thing they have close is a free disc with limited capacity.  

*So.. was this put together from complete copies of ALL the different langauges?  or is this just a copy of the free disc ( which you can get from rosetta stone.com)  .  

*While i have not downloaded and used this particular torrent, it does have the same files listed as the ulitmate language pack which is simply a copy of the free disc from the manufactuerer... call them to get this for FREE without the code written to steal your info.. yes, i love this site and use it ALOT, and 

*yes I am careful about what i download ESPECIALLY when it seems too good to be true.....got a credit card?  buy the software legit from rosetta stone, call them in 1 month ( after you made your own iso) and get ALL your money back except shipping.  Works like a charm and they don't ask questions.  

*Another thing, i have found that the languages that are listed individually in the torrent index are legitimate and have not been messed with as far as hidden apps/exe files.  I have had no bad experiences with downloading the individual languages and using them.

To do so, copy the files of the language you need into the Rosetta Stone directory, and load up Rosetta Stone. (Default is c:/windows/program files/the rosetta stone

,stumpy_c,2008-03-14T12:23Z,"For you folks having problems loading up languages with OS X...

I tried for three days to get it to work with no luck, so hopefully this will save you some heart ache.  This is how I made it work with Leopard.

1) Download the program and whichever languages you want.

2) Double-click ""Application_V2.0.7.toast""

3) Double-click ""The Rosetta Stone For Demonoid"" which mounts on your desktop

4) Double-click ""TRS Application Demonoid.toast"" in the window that opens

5) Click ""Open"" on the warning that comes up

6) Double-click ""The Rosetta Stone Start Here"" in the window that opens

7) Install The Rosetta Stone to your Applications folder

8) Download Toast 8 (multiple copies on Pirate Bay) and install it.

9) Create a new folder on the desktop

10) Copy and paste the CATMPC.TRS, CDID.TRS, and CREDITS.TRS into the folder you just created on the desktop

11) COPY (do not cut) and paste the language.rar file you want and the corresponding PCxxx-xx(jpg).rar file to the folder you created on the desktop

12) Un-rar both the language.rar and the PCxxx-xx(jpg).rar into the folder you created on the desktop

12) The language file un-rars exactly as you need it to.  Don't do anything else with it at this point.  The PCxxx-xx(jpg).rar file un-rars into one subdirectory.  For example, when you un-rar ""PCN01-08(jpg).rar"" for the Latin language, it only spits out one file: ""PCN01-08(jpg)"".

13) Open the PCxxx-xx(jpg) subfolder that was created.  For Latin this would be the ""PCN01-08(jpg)"" folder.

14) Cut and paste all of the folders within the PCxxx-xx(jpg) subfolder back into folder you created on the desktop.

15) Move both the language.rar and the PCxxx-xx(jpg).rar files to the trash.  Also move the PCxxx-xx(jpg) folder into the trash.  For Latin, this would be the ""PCN01-08(jpg)"" folder.

16) Open Toast 8

17) On the left side of the Toast 8 application, click ""ISO 9660"" under ""Data"".

18) Click the ""Select..."" button

19) Click the ""Add..."" button

20) Navigate to the folder you created on your desktop

21) Highlight all of the files within the folder you created and click ""Choose""

22) When it finishes loading the files, click ""Done'

23) Click the ""File"" drop-down menu and select ""Save as disk image...""

24) Rename the file to whatever you want (be sure to leave the "".iso"" on the end).  Select the location where you would like to save the .iso and click ""Save""

25) Navigate to wherever you chose to save the .iso image and double-click it.  Toast will open.

26) Click the ""Mount"" button inside the Toast application dialogue.  The image will mount on the desktop.

27) Navigate to the Rosetta Stone launcher in Applications and launch the program.

28) Select the language from the menu.


***I haven't tried it, but you should be able to include as many languages as you wish in the .iso you create with Toast.  Just repeat steps 11-15 until all of the appropriate files are present, then proceed as normal.***

Hope this saves someone some frustration.  HUGE props and thanks to kattana for this upload - I've wanted to get my hands on these for a very long time and could never afford it.  This is what file sharing is all about."

If your torrent program supports it, you can de-select everything except Polish once you download this torrent.

I know uTorrent and Transmission allow you to do that and I'm sure others do as well.  Try checking out the help files or any online support there may be for your particular client.

On this torrent I only downloaded French, Spanish, Latin and German, for example."
,mjnovak,2008-03-30T17:20Z,"This is an awesome torrent, I want to thank kattana from my heart. That being said, not to be critical but it would have made it soo nice to just have two or three ISOs instead of all those ZIPs. I think that I am going to make that happen since it might be a little confusing for anyone who is not savvy to figure everything out. 

Thanks again, very much"
,Monkeymusic,2008-04-06T17:49Z,"I finally got this to work after about 2 hours. The instructions explain everything very clearly except 1 part. Where it saves to save all the files to a folder and make an iso, you don't make the iso file from the folder with everything in it. Instead you are supposed to make the iso file from all the files and folders in the folder you saved everything into. I saved the iso file as Rosetta Stone, but I don't know if this is necessary. From there mount the iso and run rosetta stone. If you have any questions just ask and I'll see is i can explain it better."

,richiemiami,2008-06-08T01:07Z,"How to do this the dumbie's version

First install the Rosseta Stone Software
there are two version and they are labeled ""Application_""
in the instructions it says load the one that works
I used the first one for it... worked!

Now you have the software installed you have to create a languge image
Pick a language that you want to learn

Make sure it's one of the languages that have both the language compressed file and pictures compressed file for with out both it will not work
This means Hebrew I will not work for it is missing the Picutures compressed file

Now

create a folder on the desktop for the desired language

say English

now find the corresponding pictures for english
To do this you need to ""Instruction"" file that's in the ""Rossetta Stone Compressed"" file

here is the exact line from ""Instructions"":
English(UK) Level I        EBR01..08   130  29/12/1999    PCT01..08

so the picture files is in the PCT01..08 file

(1) simply find the compressed ""PCT01..08"" file and extract it into the English folder that you created on the desktop


(2) extract the english compressed file to the English folder that you created on the desktop

after these two steps you have the lessons and pictures in the English folder on the desktop

now you finally need the 3 tls files that are always needed regardless of what language you select

they are:
CATMPC.TRS, CDID.TRS, and Credits.TRS files

Simply copy those three files into the Enlish folder on the desktop

With this done you now have what is needed to learn a new language with Rosetta Stone but you need to either burn it to a cd/dvd or mount it using one of the many mounting software applications out there
I used Magic Iso

I double clicked magic ISO and then simply selected everything in the English directory and draged and droped it into the magic ISO windo
I then clicked on file (save as) and clcked the ISO tab so that I save it as an ISO file
I then named it English.iso and saved it to the desktop

Now you have the needed languge folder with the needed pictures with the needed three tls files all in a nice iso

Now you simply need to mount that so that Rosetta Stone software will think it's in a cd/dvd drive

again I used magic ISO and simply used the mount iso function and fount the English.iso file that I created on the desktop

NOTE: I don't think you need to worry about the name of the iso or the name of the cd all you need to worry about is that all three elements are present in the iso
The three elements is the language directories, the language pictures, and lastly the three tls files

with the iso mounted you should be able to start the Rosetta Stone software and it will recognize the languge pack instantly without doing anything

enjoy

,richiemiami,2008-06-08T02:13Z,"correction to my last post:
I noted that Hebrew I doesn't work for it doesn't have the image files

,Mau13r,2008-08-05T11:56Z,"Ok, well I have a folder that has Spanish I and II as well as the picture files that are paired with them. My laptop has a dvd burner so that's not an issue. 

It is also no clear whether the application that contains setup.exe needs to be apart of the folder that contains all of the exracted files or not. 

I am really just trying to find out how it all works in the end, i have all of the files i need extracted and in a folder, but my rosetta stone when run through ""setup.exe"" cannot recognize any languages. 

Any help is appreciated."

1) Does it have to be one language per disc? and by that I mean you can only put Chinese Mandarin I on and not both Chinese Mandarin I and II.

2) Why exactly are the lesson menus in the same language as you are about to learn? Shouldn't they be in English?

I can see the downloaded files go upto 19 levels !! for Mandarin but the CATMPC.trs file clearly mentions just 2 mandarin levels and infact whatever it mentions is what i get in the installer and I dont know how to modify that file ..can some one fix the CATMPC.TRS file to use fully downloaded languages ?? or is there any other way around ??

,madhatr4,2008-10-20T19:37Z,"Could someone please seed gaelic or irish for rosetta stone? i'm really wanting that, so if anyone could get that, please throw it my way. i'm new to torrents, so i'd appreciate it."
,Splic,2008-10-20T23:03Z,"Awesome!  It took me a while to figure out how to do this but here's a quick little set of instructions for people that don't get it:

Start off by selecting everything (to download) and then unchecking languages that you don't need (this way you don't accidentally skip anything you do need).  You might as well even download all of the languages.  Anyway, after that just extract one of the Application_v2.XXXX files (I think they're the same) to setup the program.  Once you've got that done you just need to install a language.

To do that, just extract one into its own folder and then extract the contents of PCT01-08(jpg).rar into the same folder.  After that, copy the files CATMPC.TRS, CDID.TRS and Credits.TRS into that same folder.  

To double check, you should have a folder containing about 50 different PCTXXXX folders, another 50 or so folders for you language, and then the three aforementioned files.  Now you just have to load those 100-some folders and three files onto an ISO and mount it.  Then when you run the program it should automatically recognize the files."

,morrison0880,2008-10-30T21:35Z,"Hey all. Go to 
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3865583/Rosetta_Stone_Ultimate_Language_Disk_v2.iso
You get every language in an iso file. No Extracting, all you have to do is burn it to a disc with PowerISO or Alcohol and it autostarts when you load it. You can also mount it to your virtual drive. It comes with all the help files, language sheets, and even a bonus language program. Works perfectly. I got this about a year ago and I love it.
Oh, and only 3.62 GB, so it fits perfectly on a DVD, or takes up as little space on your HD as possible. Trust me, this is the easiest way to go. I tried torrents like this, and the set up and installation alone was the biggest pain in the a...With this, no installation is needed.

The file is in ISO format. You don't have to install the program to your computer. You can use PowerISO to burn it to a disc, and it will autorun on your computer anytime after you put the disc in. Or, if you don't want to burn it, simply use the ""Mount"" option in PowerISO and choose to mount image to drive [E]. It should then open up the file folder with RS in it. If it doesn't, go to ""My Computer"", right click on your new (E) drive, and click run. That's all you have to do. Rosetta Stone will run on its own, no installation needed, no extracting files, it is all self-contained. You will see every language, all you have to do is choose one and off you go.

,107e6,2008-11-15T16:27Z,"OK, step by step how to get this to work::
1 - download Application_V2.0.8.1.rar (for Windows PC) and install.
2 - pick a language, let's use Chinese(Mandarin) Level I
3 - you need to download the following files to get Mandarin to work
a.) Chinese Mandarin I.rar (this is the audio content)
b.) PCA01-08(jpg).rar (this is the picture content,  and you get it from the list at the top of this post, also note that this picture file is shared with Japanese I, Korean I and Indonesian I & Thai I [so use it again with those language's audio content files])
c. Also download the following files from the torrent: CATMPC.TRS CDID.TRS and Credits.TRS
4. Extract the contents of both files to a folder (let's assume you call the folder TEMP), and also copy the 3 .TRS files into the TEMP folder.
5. Write a CD (or ISO) of the contents  the TEMP folder (all the CHI01_01 & PCA01_01 etc folders).
7. You are done, run Rosetta Stone and enjoy the course.

PS - It doesn't matter in which drive you insert the CD or mount the ISO image.
PSS - thank you kattana - great torrent!!"

,IPxKiller,2008-12-19T23:47Z,"Basically all i did was:

1. Extract the Language file (ex. Thai I) to a new folder

2. Then in the instruction.txt (it tells you which picture file is assoicated with which lanauge)

3. After that i extract the picture file to the same folder (ex. PCA01-08(JPG))

4. Then i copied the 3 files (CATMPC.TRS CDID.TRS and Credits.TRS) into the same folder

5. After that i copied the all the files in the folder (Not the folder itself because Rosetta Stone won't recognize it, so you have to copy every folder in that primary folder itself) to PowerISO using the .daa format (I dont think it matter which format you use)

6. After it finish saving .. i mounted it to a hard drive 

7. Then I ran Rosetta Stone software and it pick it up"
,ThirdGalaxy,2008-12-23T20:18Z,"Alvin:  Don't create a Data CD.  Just get daemon tools or an equivelent.  DONT extract the actual languages.  Mount the entire language section with daemon tools.  Then run your program and then have it look for the language you have in the cd drive.  

So you would be mounting Spanish Level 1 or German Level 1.  Not extracting whats in them.  And on that note.  If you must burn them to a CD you have to put One language on a cd as an image and not a data file."

,enlighten5,2009-01-11T00:54Z,"====I SOLVED THE PROBLEM====

Like many people, I followed all the instructions but got the message: Rosseta Stone could not find any CD (something like that).

Then after hours of work I found out where the problem was: I put all the required files (pictures, language, the 3 .TRS files) in a folder called ""Spanish"", then I made an ISO image with this folder. Here's the problem! You're supposed to make an ISO image from THE CONTENTS IN THE FOLDER, NOT THE FOLDER ITSELF. In other words, when you open this *Spanish* ISO with Magic ISO or whatever, you're supposed to see all the language and picture and TRS files directly displayed, rather than a folder containing these files.

Hope I made myself clear =) Try it, guys!

Also, many thanks to kattana for uploading this great stuff! "

,omfg_stfu,2009-01-27T01:13Z,"no shit, i'm 10 years in buisness, and i've NEVER downloaded a torrent with so inhumanly bad instructions for the installation.

kattana, could you just write exactly how to get languages working? i created about 20 .iso files, sick of it. do it proper or dont even do it."
,nikojpapa,2009-01-27T04:33Z,"ok nvm abuot my other question, i guess you cant. but i ahve a new one:

there is no PC301..19, which is the picture file you need for Greek II

is this a typo and it means a different one, or is it just not there?

also, this DOES WORK! i will write clearer instruction when i get the chance, but im way too busy with school and midterms"
,usman_minhas,2009-01-27T16:09Z,"This is simplz fantastic, but if there would be some translation in english then it will make life easier. bt anz wazs good work"
,ninjaki10,2009-01-27T18:31Z,"Ok... so after looking back through the various other comments I've found out how to make this work!

Unzip the required language and corresponding picture zips and put them into a random folder... remember where this is.

Then copy over the .trs files.

Afterwards, copy over the open instantly application (Which ever application has therosettastone.exe file) 

Now you should have in one folder, the files from the application.exe folder, all the language files, the image files, and the three .trs files. 

In Magic Iso select the files in the folder you have created. NOT THE FOLDER ITSELF. What you want to do is copy all the info you have just gathered and save it into an ISO, so that when you browse your iso you get a look at all the files you've moved. Save the file in a safe place.

Mount your ISO and then browse it. Click on therosettastone.exe ON THE ISO. This should open it correctly. 

As a last minute note: THANK YOU KATTANA!!!"
,wes_reeks,2009-01-27T23:53Z,"I'm new to torrent use and just today downloaded my first client. I thought I followed the instructions as best I could but when I was finished downloading the torrent through my client the file wasn't working, it would just open in the client again as if I was downloading it without it actually downloading again. anyone care to dumb this down for FURTHER for a noob?"
,morgan_g,2009-02-03T07:05Z,"so, will this work for version 3.2???? I would like to figure that out before I download it."
,goldenthorn,2009-02-03T09:39Z,"Happy thanks to kattana for the torrent - this is fantastic! I've spent the last couple of hours refreshing my arabic and will be working on spanish next; I was skeptical, but this is a great program!
And thanks to enlighten5 and ninjaki10 for elucidating the actual setup process. Rather than mindlessly staring at the provided directions and trying to figure out exactly what was meant, I created, mounted, and loaded the program within 10 minutes with your directions."
