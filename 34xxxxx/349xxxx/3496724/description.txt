How to use this torrent
=====================================================

Short way
=====================================================
Download the application, languages and images you need(check 
the list at the end of this file) and extract all the files, 
add them and the CATMPC.TRS CDID.TRS and Credits.TRS files to a 
cd/dvd/iso. (mac users need to add the files from the application
cd as well, this step is optional if you are only using the 
languages on windows) Then install the application software 
for windows or mac and insert the cd/dvd or mount the image 
and run the program.

Long way
=====================================================
The first step to using the rosetta stone software after
starting the torrent and installing the application
is to pick which languages you want to download if you do 
not want all of them. Most bittorrent
clients(the program you run to download the torrent) let
you choose not to download some files(the languages you do
not want) or pick which files to download(the languages you
DO want).

After you have decided you also need to make sure you 
download the proper image files from the torrent, to find
out which images you need check the list of languages at the
end of this file. (you could also just get the PCT and PCA 
image files if you are feeling lucky, most of the languages 
use those two)

You also have to download all the .TRS files and a copy of the 
application(the program that runs the language files)
On windows this is in a .rar file called  Application_XXXXXX.rar 
the XXXXX part is the version number and you can just ignore that. 
Extract all the files and run setup.exe or therosettastone.exe. 
There are two Application_XXXXX.rar files for windows, 
try either one and if you have a problem use the other.
On a Mac just run the Application_VXXXXX.toast file.

Next you have to open the .Rar archive files for the languages
and images you need and extract the files inside to a folder(just
make a new one anywhere and remember where it is, we will be using
 it alot), these will be folders named like XXX##_## where X are 
letters and # are numbers.

The last files you need are CATMPC.TRS CDID.TRS and Credits.TRS, copy them to
the same folder and the language and image files/folders.
MACintosh users also need to copy the files from the application cd(.toast image)
to the folder.

The folder with all the files in it should look like the one in
the "sample_image.jpg" picture. (the picture should be in the same
folder as this document)

The last step is to take all the files in the folder and either burn
them to a CD or DVD you can use when you want to use the languages or
if you know how, make a CD/DVD image file with a program like MagicISO
or Nero and mount the file to use the languages. Both of those options
can be complicated so I will leave the details out of these instructions
if you need help theres lots of information online if you google or search
for "how to burn a CD or DVD" or "how to make a dvd image", or "how to 
mount and image file".




List of languages
to find the images for the language you want find the language in the list
and look at the end of the line for the associated picture files
for example if you want image files for English(US) Level I it says you need
PCT01..08 images so you would need to download "PCT01-08(jpg).rar"
