As the title says, a teaser of the arival of Chaos. 

I'm doing this as part of a process as build up to the release of Sonic Adventure.

More info as to what i i'm doing, go to this link, http://www.soniconthe.net/viewtopic.php?t=252

The trailer must be in a widescreen view if watching in Media Player Classic, or the video will looked stretched.

A longer detailed trailer to come soon.

Enjoy.
