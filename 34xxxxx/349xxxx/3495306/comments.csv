Whom ever it was, thanks.

I saw that 5 now have a complete copy and are now seeders.
To all seeders, it's payback time to keep this torrent alive for others!

,Gamejunkiez,2010-08-23T17:48Z,"How to run this on Win7 x64:

Riven and Quick Time 3.0 do not install from the Riven CD on Win7 x64 as they use a old installer.

- Install Riven on a older PC or on VMware.
- Copy the install dir to your Win7 x64 PC.

- Install Quick Time 3.0 on a oldermachine or on VMware.
- Copy the extracted temp files to your Win7 x64 PC.

- Installing QT3.0 is a bit tricky and it may look like it fails.
- Install Quick Time 3.0 by launching: ""QT32INST.EXE""
- Hit skip and then hit install.
- If the demo movie is able to play you know it installed succesfull.

- Mount CD number 2 and launch Riven.exe from the install dir.

I tested this with the CD version of Riven, not sure or it works for the DVD version."
