,CampKing,2006-07-21T12:55Z,Same here :( Anyone got a solution?
,Astarte*,2006-08-26T21:35Z,"In rFactor folder, go to Tools/Folder options/View tab and uncheck ""Hide file extensions for known file types""

Now you'll be able to change the extension.

Rename the original rFactor.exe to rFactor.ex_

Don't overwrite it! It seems that the crack needs
the original (renamed) exe to work."
