Continuum is revamped client for an old game, called SubSpace. SubSpace was originally developed as a commercial venture by Virgin Interactive Entertainment (VIE), and was marketed and sold as a boxed game. Despite this, problems within VIE and other contributing factors, VIE stopped supporting the game and closed down all of its servers. This was not the end of the game however. Player run-servers soon started to appear, and were connected to a centralised billing server (Sonera Billing).

At this point, cheats/hacks were common - and Continuum was developed by two players, PriitK and Mr. Ekted to try not only add new functionality, but also remove the cheating element.

The Game itself is essentially a highly addictive top-down 2d space shoot 'em up, containing various zones offering different styles of gameplay. Since all of the servers are now player run, you can participate in the fun FREE OF CHARGE.
