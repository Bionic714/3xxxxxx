"Pj Proby is a greater balladsinger than Frank Sinatra and Tony Bennet" wrote the 

british sixties most famous journalist, Nik Cohn.

I agree. 

Nik Cohn also said, in the swedish televisionprogramme "Kobra" in May 2005, that

 there really was only two true personalites in "swinging London" during the 

sixties, the late Jimi Hendrix and... PJ Proby.
