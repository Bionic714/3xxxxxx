I present to you the 4th book in the Women's Murder Club, "The 4th of July" by James Patterson. I scoured the internet looking for this book in e-book format and found nothing so I decided to just do it myself...lol

In a few weeks I should have 5th book in the Women's Murder Club completed so keep and eye out for the "The 5th Horseman"...:)

Peace Out
