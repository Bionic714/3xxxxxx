,DarkPilot,2006-06-09T21:36Z,"Its not free, bobdaslob.."
,4X-AXG,2006-06-09T21:56Z,"it's free, but you have to register with a valid e-mail account..and I don't guess you (bobdaslob) would like to give your valid email address to aerosoft.."
,4X-AXG,2006-06-09T22:01Z,"I'm sure a lot of people here don't want to give out their email addresses to any payware developer. and besides, aerosoft's own comment says it all:

Although the German Football Stadiums is a free product, it is not FREEWARE product"
,PapaHotel,2006-06-10T00:55Z,"Oh well, just a temp. e-mail account works fine for me. I admitt I love auto-installers because I'm a bit lazy =)"
,rrodger99,2006-06-10T02:08Z,Any interest in AT&T Natural Voices or NeoSpeech?
,toddw,2006-06-10T03:42Z,"I registered with Aerosoft with an anonymous email address___ got the download link instantly, but they send you a personalized serial key that is tied to your email address__ for those that sighed-up it would be unwise to share your personal key!__ just to be on the safe side.

,4X-AXG,2006-06-10T16:07Z,can somebody (re)seed? I've been stuck at 38% for a long time now..thanks :)
,toddw,2006-06-11T04:27Z,"Hey Luke97__ I tried the de-wrapper on the SkyUnlimited P-38 VOL.2__ same here, it's a no go__ Time for ""wildmans"" to update his de-wapper.

I don't think much of SkyUnlimited's products, not much better than ""freeware""__ but if I come across it in my attempts at bartering  (LoL)__ I'll grab it.

,Mogz,2006-06-11T04:29Z,"I tend to disagree with you todd skyunlimited products arnt all that bad 10,000% better than what alpha releases :)"
[V],knark_hopp,2006-06-11T14:18Z,"Well, some Alpha releases are top-notch, yet most of them do indeed suck. SkyUnlimited is in my opinion average.
Anybody have any Dublin VFR sceneries?"
