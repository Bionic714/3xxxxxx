Dear keerkegan

Could you please seed/upload the complete torrent of ""Pirates of the Caribbean - The lost disc"" at least once then I will seed it for a min of 2 years(& forever if I upgrade my 120gb hard drive.)

I know that this torrent was made in 2006,but even now there are more than 12 people including me who are all stuck at "" 64.1% "" (I have been waiting for over a month & a half , only then I decided to post this comment.)
We require just 1 seeder for just a couple of days, thats all !! just for a couple of days !!

Please !!! This is a potc special disc and should be available to all the pirates forever, it should not die down so soon(This is the only torrent that has this special disc, hence much more the importance of seeding it)

If you would seed it at least once more then many people, including me would be grateful to you


PS : I have posted this comment on all your torrent detail sections. If you have read this then please ignore it and sorry for bothering you everywhere  :P"
