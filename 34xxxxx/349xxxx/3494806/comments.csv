,waiti,2006-06-27T11:45Z,"al proximo sueco, danes, noruego o lo que sea que venga por canarias y no sepa hablar español le voy a decir lo mismo: En este sitio sólo se habla español nada de lenguas nordicas. ¿Te gustaría eso? Pues a mi tampoco que digan que no se admite el español..."

,Dr.,2008-05-19T00:33Z,"I think what Swewarg means is that thepiratebay is made by some swedish guys. Thats true though...but that don't give him the rights to harass somebody. Swewarg: Just be grateful for sites like thepiratebay, and be grateful for people who wants to upload stuff to other people...eventhough they are not swedish like you!"
,gekkexana,2008-07-11T00:00Z,"oh wow, thank you so much for the portugese subs!! "

,Seabutcher,2009-02-11T01:36Z,"thuglife2: The Pirate Bay is, in fact, based in Sweden. It's because of the copyright laws there that nobody has been able to sue them.

Also, there are no site rules about what language(s) something may or may not be uploaded in, just that you don't mis-label it.
The site is accessible in most countries around the world, and believe it or not,  people from some of those countries speak Spanish as a first language."
,JOR23,2011-02-22T04:07Z,guys ... 친구...Vänner...amigos...Bạn bè...Пријатели ... I just love you all... IM DOWNLOADING NOW...
,Sklyn,2011-03-08T21:43Z,"Muchas gracias. Thank you so much.

,LurzKesh,2011-08-02T06:16Z,"ok well it comes up with alot of bup files and my wmp wont play it, can anyone help?"
,lavaflav,2011-10-24T23:30Z,"So I'm one of those guys who actually gives people the answer after figuring it out, instead of never coming back to the torrent page!  You can run it with vlc.  It's simple really, the file labeled video_ts, is actually the dvd disk image, so if you were to burn that, you could than play that on most any dvd player!  But if you just want to watch the movie on your pc, than again, vlc."
,xpandora197,2012-05-10T06:13Z,they had to change it to .se for the fact this site would've been shut down by the government
,xpandora197,2012-05-10T06:14Z,"The U.S. government that is. since it is now a ""swedish"" site, then the U.S. can't touch it."
,The_Sound,2012-06-07T21:44Z,"De puta madre. Gracias desde España :D
Fuck Yeah. Thanks from Spain."
,ThisGuy210,2012-06-21T01:26Z,It has a swedish domain because they can't have servers in the US or in England. Duh
