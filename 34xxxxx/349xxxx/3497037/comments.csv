,Snippe83,2006-06-21T13:24Z,No seeders :(
,gorrec,2006-06-21T13:25Z,It's better if you noobs leave the official blizzard downloader open instead of closing it as soon as your download is finished.
,Snippe83,2006-06-21T13:27Z,Well if u stuck @ 85%....then what ?
,gorrec,2006-06-21T13:31Z,"stuck at 93% and that's because ppl shut down the P2P application as soon as they're done, they're selfish bastards, as they are in the game aswell."
,schorre,2006-06-21T13:43Z,"please seed this as fast as you can. there will be lots of people on this torrent since blizzards downloader is so slow. (for me it barely works at all since my connection won't allow peer2peer-traffic on the ports they are using). using a real client I can download/seed with 10Mbit/s, so I'll be grateful and seed this for quite some time when I get it."
,hevreka,2006-06-21T14:25Z,Blizz Tracker Online Again as of about 14:22
,Lunatico,2006-06-21T15:00Z,"Im seeding as fast as possible folks, but its many trying to dowload it so its going to work in a few. Servers still arent up. 

Ill keep seeding, sorry for it being slow before, should be better now, stopped all my own downloadings ;O"
