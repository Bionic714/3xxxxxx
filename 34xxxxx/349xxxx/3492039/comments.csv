Anyone got any ideas please."

I mounted the prog as you said bu it still tells me tht the disc is wrong so I give up."

I've olso had the same problem.  Tried the wilco version.  It worked for a while. but then suddenly it shut down fs9 and jumped back to windows.  And I cant even insall this version as mentioned on my previous comment.  I have no idea..  Shame because this is a cool plane for fs9..  BUT any help would be great."
