This includes a 6GB disk image (compressed to nearly 700MB) pre-installed with Mac OS X Tiger 10.4 (final 8A428) and it also includes PearPC 0.4 (not pre). There should be a short "readme" when you first run the extractor. Seed after you get this complete emulator package, which is built and arranged by me.

Also, my ISP might be a bum so my upload rates could be up to 20 kb/s at the highest. Kinda bear with me as I attempt to upload as much as I can out of nearly 700MB, which could take a while. Thanx for understanding.

If you are not picking up any seeders on this tracker at this time, I am planning to link both this tracker and Demonoid.com as a multi-tracker torrent on isohunt.com soon, so there may be a pretty big neighborhood over there.
