,Murky6,2006-06-20T16:23Z,is who in BDSM?
,Tri_Motor,2006-06-20T18:31Z,"I think this torrent is corrupt, because this torrent is 92 megs and I have downloaded 129 megs...  stuck @ 99.8%... seeder pops in and upload a lot of rejected data... @ the seeder, you are either purposely resending data or this is corrupt...you may want to consider deleting this torrent and upload a new torrent"
,Murky6,2006-06-20T19:05Z,the file is fine its just crap that is being sent by others
,Murky6,2006-06-20T19:06Z,and yes this is a new torrent
,Tri_Motor,2006-06-20T19:15Z,Well  Bollocks to you then__ I'm already @ 8:1 share ratio__ I'm tired of your game playing and I'm buggering off some place else.
,belga1,2006-06-21T01:27Z,"Sorry but this torrent is DEFINITELY a BS....
Better erase it...ang go fishing.....enjoy the sun and the nature... :)"
,Tri_Motor,2006-06-21T18:06Z,"Well here's the torrent I found that I go after this one never completed....http://www.fulldls.com/downloading_games_6893

But it has the same file name and file location as this one from TPB, so in order to get the one from the Fulldls link above 100%,  you have to stop this torrent (TPB) and run the one from the link."
,Tri_Motor,2006-06-21T18:41Z,"Ahhh, I see what happened now .... if you run both torrents @ the same time the one from Fulldls.com and the one from TPB... they conflict with each other because of the slightly different HASH... that explains why I kept seeing the seeder pop in and out with 100%, switching back and forth between 100 & 99.8 %... the two torrent were fighting each other."
,Tri_Motor,2006-06-21T18:45Z,"Fucking people bollocked up the whole mess... just run the torrent from Fulldls.com, ON IT""S OWN... stop the torrent from TPB... then run the torrent from Fulldls.com let it HASH check, it will then read 99.8%... then the torrent will finish to 100% from Fulldls.com..."
,Murky6,2006-06-21T21:21Z,"here you go this should work i completely
