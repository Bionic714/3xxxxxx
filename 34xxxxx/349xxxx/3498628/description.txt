Synopsis:
As unlikely as it seemed that 1984\'s abysmal Children of the Corn (very loosely based on a Stephen King tale) would generate any interest in a sequel, this belated follow-up is nevertheless a slight improvement on its predecessor, with higher production values and a slightly more coherent (if fatally flawed) script. The once-homicidal youths of Gatlin, Nebraska are back, transported to a nearby town to be re-integrated into society (they have no recollection of the massacre from the previous film). In no time at all they succumb once again to the devilish influence of a young leader (Ryan Bollman), who organizes them to take murderous action against suspicious adults; those who stumble too close to their secret become blood sacrifices to \"He Who Walks Behind The Rows.\" The scenario of the first film is recreated here ? albeit with slight variations and more imaginative death scenes ? with little explanation given regarding the true source of the kids\' demonic power. A clever subplot suggests that a strain of corn-smut toxin may be responsible for their homicidal mania, but little is done with it. Followed by even more sequels.
