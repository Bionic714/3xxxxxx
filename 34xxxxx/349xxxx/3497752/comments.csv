,silentthunder,2006-07-10T00:36Z,"I dont think there is such thing as a no-cd crack for this game. It can easily be burnt to a cd, it's old enough that anyone with a cd burner can make a copy of it. Alternatively you can mount it to play."
,lappekake,2006-07-13T17:07Z,does it work?
,silentthunder,2006-07-15T03:11Z,"yes it works, i tested it"

,Ronette,2006-10-07T13:21Z,Why does it say that I have to install the original game before installing deluxe?
,silentthunder,2006-10-08T20:34Z,"Ronette, you must be mistaken. This is the original game with both expansions. There is no need to install anything else. Just mount or burn the disc, install and play."
,HTL63,2006-10-31T09:22Z,"very good game, thank you !"
,tribeccarose,2006-11-12T22:01Z,How come it says I have to unistall the original game before I install this when I don't have any roller coaster installed

I'vd downloaded your torrent ""Rollercoaster Tycoon Deluxe"". But it doesn't work. I've installed the game, but when I want to start the game it says that I have to put the Rct Loopy Landscapes CD in my computer. Can you please help me? Thanks...

,silentthunder,2007-03-15T20:57Z,"Bokske,
I can't imagine why you would encounter that error. I have been running the game for years and have never had that problem. The game is all on one disk, loopy landscapes is on the disk. Sorry I can't help you, I can't think of an explanation."

,silentthunder,2007-09-04T03:15Z,"kasualty123,
You can either mount the iso to play or burn it if you want.

If you have the disc mounted or in your drive, and it says ""insert disc in the following drive"" rename the drive in that box to whichever drive the disc is in, then press ok."

,silentthunder,2007-11-09T22:18Z,"For anyone with the problem where it tells you to uninstall previous versions that arent installed, try this. Go to start, click run. Type ""regedit"" in the box and click ""ok"". Look in the ""software"" folder (under hkey local machine). Scroll through the folders and find ""Fish Technology Group"". (why it is fish and not infogrames, i dont know). Delete that stuff, restart your comp and try installing the game."

,Pretty333,2008-08-24T22:48Z,"Works great! Thanks. To mount, download daemon tools and use the program to mount image. As long as it is mounted you can use the desktop game icon to play as normal. You can use daemon tools to mount iso files.  ; )"

,6r33n,2008-12-30T19:02Z,"Btw, this torrent works perfectly. Although, there is no crack so you'll have to mount it each time you want to play.
Thx uploader!"
,6r33n,2008-12-30T19:49Z,"Sorry about all my comments but I've found a working way to crack it, via the Register.

,DjMuzik,2009-01-19T21:21Z,Does anyone have RCT 2 + Expansions?
,silentthunder,2009-03-06T18:21Z,"Thanks 6r33n for sharing the no-cd fix.
DjMuzik, I have rct2 and wacky worlds but i'm missing the time one. I would make a torrent but it seems theres already one on TPB for all of them, search ""rct2""."
,dorkwad,2009-04-19T08:56Z,"1. Copy all the files from the data directory on the cd to the data 
directory in your game file, use the data directory from which ever 
expansion cd you are using, if any. You can overwrite the existing files if 
you wish.

2.Use your registry editor and find HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\FISH 
TECHNOLOGY GROUP\ROLLERCOASTER TYCOON SETUP. Under ""setup path"", change it 
to fit your game directory (example c:\games\Roller Coaster Tycoon

3. Enjoy the game without the cd.


P.S. ""Regedit.exe"" is usually found in the Windows directory, and be careful 
using it."
,Tehmulletman,2009-05-31T11:37Z,awesome works perfectly just mount using daemon tools easy as that lol
,Dhfhy,2009-06-09T19:17Z,"For everyone who does not know what mounting means, I Will explain it for you.

NuMbEr OnE: Go To http://www.disk-tools.com/download/daemon

The Purpose of downloading this is to mount the game.

Once you download it, it prompts you to restart your computer. Do So. Once you restart your computer it will fully install and uncheck all the things you dont want daemon to install, Like making your home page the daemon homepage and the toolbar and all that junk.

Now before you mount your game you need to find the .img file that is in the torrent you have downloaded. I Find it, Right Click Copy and place it on my desktop for an easy find.


Once it is downloaded you need to find a blank CD. Put the blank CD in.  Open Daemon. Look down by your clock. You Should see an icon that looks like a CD With a lightning bolt in it. Click on it. 2 Options should come up. Click the second one.

Find the .img file.

and there you go open the .img file with Daemon and you will be able to install the game.

Thanks,

~~Dhfhy~~"
,rwoelich,2009-06-11T22:25Z,"Thanks dorkwad, but on Vista 64 Bit:

The only problem I have to address is the name of most of the roller coaster tracks, for example; u(0010) is the name of 1 of the tracks which is obviously set as a default; is there anyway of retrieving the original roller coaster names so that I know what i'm building?

,Fantasy_Legend,2010-11-29T02:50Z,"@myastas - Had the same problem myself mate!

All you got to do is search your whole comp for anything called 'RCT', 'roller coater tycoon' and 'unifish' and delete all of them. Chances are it still won't work so I then downloaded Regseeker found here http://www.snapfiles.com/get/regseeker.html which allows you to delete any registry keys that are still on your comp after you installed it.

Start up 'Regseeker' and untick the bottom left option that says backup because you don't want to backup anything. After that click on 'find in registry' and make sure all of the 'HKEY' options are ticked then search for the 3 things I mentioned above individually and delete them all. If this doesn't help then you're in shit street mate because there's no other way round it! Oh and don't forget to untick the backup option everytime you make a new search on Regseeker. Hope that helps kidda!"

now SELECT RCT.exe and click open click apply then Ok
