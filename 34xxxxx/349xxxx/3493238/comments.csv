,Bolbey,2006-06-07T22:15Z,Is this PAL or USA?
,GeXiUs90,2006-06-22T23:59Z,Great Game ! thx alot! works fine!
,Bolbey,2006-06-27T12:55Z,"Not working for me. On some point it just freezes and after a while ""There is error with the disc..."" note appears. Whats up with that?"
,fintupp,2006-06-29T20:39Z,"""On some point it just freezes and after a while ""There is error with the disc..."" note appears.""

So, would you mind specifying where it freezes"
,Bolbey,2006-06-29T21:01Z,When you leave from caves and start mission where you have to save some villagers from getting killed by goblins. It hangs on some time but then it crashes. Any ideas?
,vodkaeye,2006-07-09T10:48Z,i have completed this on a pal box with no crashes try enigmah if that doesnt work get qwix and optimise the iso i did make this a few years back with an older xiso creation tool

i had the same problem but with other games, do you get error messages when you eject discs too? i had to reset the hard drive back to factory settings & then reload the dash i'd been using, haven't had any trouble since then. (turned out the hard drive had become corrupted)"
,FaZ,2006-08-13T12:46Z,i have a PAL and get freezes on some games if they are US.. So can be that.. 
,Tramlen,2006-12-13T19:12Z,does this work on `pc?
,roppe29,2007-09-24T03:18Z,seeda! sn채lla!
,bingo_bob,2008-02-27T06:07Z,"I'm seeding this right now.  I'm NOT new to Xbox ISOs but I can't get this one to work.  Tried burning straight to DVD, tried patching ISO with Craxtion 4, tried copying contents of ISO directly to my Xbox HD...all of these result in me getting booted back to EVOX when I try to execute the game.  Any ideas?"
,bingo_bob,2008-02-27T06:20Z,"In RE to my above comment:

Got it working by patching the default.xbe AGAIN with QWIX then uploading that file to my xbox HD again.  If you happen to have the same problem as me, try this first.  If you want it on a disk, you can probably unpack the ISO with Craxtion 4 then repack with QWIX after you patch in QWIX.  I've been out of the scene for a few years, so my dashboard is OLD and I don't feel like updating, so maybe that's part of this problem."
