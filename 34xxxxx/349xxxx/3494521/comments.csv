,Lasbas,2007-06-26T23:52Z,"I downloaded and succesfully installed the game. 
When i try and enter the game, it says that i need the cd.
I cant find any image for daemon tools to use (im no good at this), and i tried to burn a cd with all the files in the winRAR (download file). Just wondering if i only got the name on the cd wrong , and thats it, called it: ""Warcraft II BNE"". "

,Torrent245,2008-09-19T06:12Z,"It even comes with Alcohol 120%?

,P503C,2010-02-13T18:35Z,"Ok. This torrent kicks ass. Thanks everyone for seeding! 

And in case anyone got confused with the Alcohol thing, just use Daemon tools if you have it. It's the exact same type of program, no need to have both as far as I can tell. "
,cjnqn88,2010-02-23T08:42Z,"I entered the serial number when asked for the registration, and after that tried to run it. It then told me to enter the CD, and I no longer have the option of entering the serial number again. It seemed to accept it the first time. I used 6696-2TGV-TT64-CNMV."
,PixelOrc,2010-03-14T00:20Z,"THERE IS A TROJAN IN THIS!
But it makes a difference what antivirus software you use!!

I downloaded this last night & installed it on my desktop, it works perfectly. Played a few levels into the Human campaign.

Today I copied it to my laptop, and tried to install, but when I got to the part of ""installing the crack for Alchohol 120%"", my computer INSTANTLY told me that the crack-file itself (the Activator.exe) was a trojan.

My laptop has PC Tools Antivirus (which identified the trojan), but my desktop uses Avast! Antivirus (which did not notice any trojan). Both use Win XP."
,Naphier,2010-03-20T15:34Z,"Not sure I understand why all this work was done with the battlenet version since the key supplied is banned from battlenet.
You can play the rest of the game fine tho."
,joka2385,2010-03-24T03:30Z,"First off. Thanks for FUCKING my laptop up! FUCK FACE! On top of my computer operating poorly now, my antivirus (mcafee) isn't working anymore either thanks to this download! It says to reinstall but I cant cause I dl it for free from a devry website. What am I to do now?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? Also slow DL time. FUCK."
,ZaelKael,2010-03-24T17:22Z,"Funny joka2385, it seems to be working perfectly for everyone else but you, now, why is that? clearly because you don't know what the fuck it is your doing, People like you need to do the Up-loader's a favor and have a nice cup of shut the fuck up and let them do their job, they are doing this on THEIR time for YOUR entertainment, don't know how to get to work? ask somebody, don't go on and Insult him, if you can't seem to respect the Up-loader's, then why don't you go BUY the actual fuckin game off of steam or game stop, or what other sources, people don't want to hear you whinny babies moan and complain. "
,Chrishnack,2010-04-18T14:01Z,ok so if im getting this straight alchohol is just like daemon tools but it has a virus attached to it so all i need is daemon tools which i deleted like a week ago
,Banzay27,2010-05-04T22:50Z,"Downloaded the image, the CD-Key notepad file and the patch - used Daemon Tools to mount the image. Installed everything, played up to the 7th human mission. So far, so good. Runs well on WinXP (DX9), no visual glitches, sound and music normal, includes cinematics and, indeed, the expansion.
Thanks for the great upload."
,Reaper348,2010-05-13T19:59Z,"First off, thanks for the upload, it works great. second: There is no virus on this the one guy that is blaming you for his shitty comp is most likely experiencing a false positive. Third: How do I access the game after closing? It didn't create a desktop Icon and I don't want to go clicking every file."
,connoradsettIV,2010-10-08T23:17Z,"628G-GDKW-9B92-VXDZ
This serial key works i use it and it works fine game accepts it "
,whosdamansteam,2010-10-21T02:02Z,I have a problem when i attempt to load the game in windows XP after installing it. when I go to load it it pops up with an error about direct draw and it says to set desktop area to 640 x 480 pixels and set color pallete to 256 colors so i did that and it sill gave me the error. When I attempted to use compatability mode with it whenever i would load it there would be a no disk error even though i mounted it in alchohol 120. I also tried daemons tools and it did the same thing.
,Razr92,2011-01-17T23:24Z,"@joka2385 , Dont use McAfee Mate, It sux now , even Norton , use Nod32 or Microsoft Security Essentials . MS Sec. Essentials Cleans everything and is the best And better than paid Antiviruses."
,AAW007,2011-04-07T04:41Z,"WARNING!

The following file:

""...Downloads\Warcraft II Battle NET Edition\Alcohol 120% 1.9.5.3823\Crack\Alcohol 120% 1.9.5.3823 Activator.exe""

Contains a Trojan Virus (BackDoor-AWQ.b!efs) so DO NOT select ""all files"" in the Torrent download setup screen.  The only files/folders you need to download are the ISO image and the Patch folder.  (The readme only relates to the Alochol setup etc.)

You dont have to use Alcohol (lol) or Daemon Tools you know, you can simply just copy the ISO image file directly onto a CD...!  (You don't have to mount it on your Hard drive).  If you do want to though, there are other ways... Just an idea!

Be carefull and always use good AntiVirus/Firewall software.

Adam."
,Makkapew,2011-04-25T02:03Z,"I guess you could use PowerISO aswell instead of Deamon Tools or that other program which was attached to this torrent. (?)
PowerISO is free and can be found here. It is used to 'mount' .iso or virtual disc files on your computer!

http://www.poweriso.com/"
,EclipsedRony,2011-05-12T12:26Z,"Because of other comments - downloaded only Image folder. Mounted iso with Daemon tools lite,installed and everything works well! Just need to have the disc (either mounted on virtual drive or burned on CD)!"
,funthea,2011-08-20T21:09Z,"If you know what your doing you wont bother with alcohol just use daemon tools, but other than that great torrent thumbs up"
,GantZ69,2012-03-14T05:56Z,"Works great, can this game able to access battlenet? Any clue pls Adv. TQ =)"
