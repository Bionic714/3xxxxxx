Nevertheless, good upload!"
,DarkPilot,2006-06-09T21:06Z,perhaps why they cost very and they are worth little?
,Massmordaren,2006-06-09T21:15Z,"Sure, the prices are a bit heavy - and some of Alphasim's birds are pure crap - but the aircrafts released the latest year have proven to be quite astonishing. Just think of addons like the F-22 and the Flanker pack, and I think you will get my point."
,DarkPilot,2006-06-09T21:34Z,"True, Massmordaren, but unfortunately has always the virtual cockpit nearly false, a lot little clicked.."
,Massmordaren,2006-06-09T21:58Z,"That is really a shame - Alphasim sure got the potential to create beautiful models.

By the way, I just tested the aircraft - and I couldn't agree more; it's crap.
*Especially* the VC."
,DarkPilot,2006-06-09T22:00Z,Eh eh I had said it... :)
,Mogz,2006-06-10T02:33Z,Well AlphaSim does make a couple of decent aircraft but 3-4 out of almost 100 doesnt make the company any better than crapola :)
,belga1,2006-06-16T03:19Z,"Alpha Sim made the best planes ever seen.It's a pleasure to buy them and use....
I hope the y will produce more of these beauties....I can't wait!!!"
