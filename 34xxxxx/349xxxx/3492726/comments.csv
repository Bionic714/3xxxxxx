,methamp,2009-01-30T03:45Z,"I also lost my CD. Bought it from a TigerDirect outlet store near Chicago and the MFG. wants to charge me to purchase updated drivers which do not work with Windows XP SP3, so I'm forced to ""steal"" the older version that I bought. What a bunch of bullshit. Avoid this company in the future for your USB accessories."
