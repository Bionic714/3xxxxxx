,Wraithform,2007-07-31T08:04Z,"Not seeing ""Inane(Undermined Remix)"" in here.

Just pointing it out. Great download though."

,deadguy76,2007-08-22T05:34Z,Awesome collection! some of the files tend to go corrupt though. Are you going to include Tohuvabohu in this?
,njure,2007-11-26T15:16Z,thanks mofker :)
,federalduckk,2008-04-14T08:26Z,"whoa, thanks for this."

,Volryn666,2008-07-06T09:35Z,"Incredible collection Domino. Seriously. Awsome stuff.

NO PITY FOR THE MASSES!

I thank you considering its hard to find thier albums in these lame ass mainstream american walmarts and fuckin targets. Damn OC sux to live in. Thankee for uploading non-mainstreamed music for the enjoyment of others!!!"
,missleighofmichigan,2008-09-12T00:00Z,"In response to the guy who couldn't find the albums in stores, I found the remastered editions at Hot Topic! The bigger stores have almost every album :)"
,daffyz,2008-09-20T01:11Z,Don't download unless you are happy with 128 kbs.
,thomasanderson911,2008-12-18T11:27Z,"Good torrent, but missing many singles / maxi-CDs / EPs, such as the Godlike single and others (their singles are typically a bit different than the same songs on their albums).

Regarding MDFMK. The ""MDFMK"" listed here is the ALBUM title. KMFDM also briefly renamed the band to MDFMK to release an album on a different label. This is what jalan is looking for. I have this, though not handy to put up as a torrent right now. I am sure it is around and findable.

ALSO...KMFDM also did some work as the band named Excessive Force. hat is good stuff too, especially ""Conquer Your House"", ""Conquer Your World"", and ""We Like War"".

JukeJointJezebel and remixes to name one.

,obin_gam,2009-02-21T20:22Z,for a newbie is there any kind of best of album? or tips on albums thats considered the best?
,mr_ajnin,2009-03-26T20:37Z,"Okay, I'm looking @ my KMFDM CDs right now. I own everything they've put out for the past 25 years (Practically) MISSING: Blitz,
Boots, WWII Tour, Ruck Zuck, Brimborium, Tohuvabohu, Money [EP], Help us, Save us Takeus Away [EP], Godlike [EP], Skold vs. KMFDM, Juke-Joint Jezebel [EP]/Giorgio Moroder mixes, Brute [EP], A Drug Against War [EP], Glory [EP], Sin Sex and Salvation (Japanese version has an extra track!), Rules [EP], 84-86, Spider-Man 2: The Movie [Videogame soundtrack], MDFMK [EP] and MDFMK (Self-Titled) ""both separate CDs!"", the KMFDM/TKK ""Days of Swine and Roses/Naive"" [EP], I think that's about it. I also have the side projects: KGC ""Dirty Bomb"", Schwein ""Schweinstein"" & ""Son of Schweinstein"". I own everything I've listed and you've listed! If I knew how to make a torrent, you'd all be able to get your hands on my 10gb KMFDM Collection!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I also Have every PIG album to date. 
Also, this torrent is completely crazy and unorganized. You should take pride in such a great collection of music. Sorry, KMFDMs one of my obsessions"
,mr_ajnin,2009-03-26T20:39Z,"By the way, EVERYTHING I own is completely original Wax Trax! Perfection! NO REMASTERS or ""EXTRA"" volumes!"
,mr_ajnin,2009-03-26T21:24Z,"Is your Naive original? With the uncut Liebeslied? It took a long time to find but I got the ORIGINAL display copy from the Wax Trax! store in chicago. Not Cheap! This CD was BANNED due to a copyright infringement on Liebeslied. The Kapt'n used a sample from ""O' Fortuna"" without Permission. I also wanna correct myself, above I messed up and wrote ""WWII tour"" I meant ""WWIII Tour"". I also left out the album Opium! Which I'm holding right now. "
