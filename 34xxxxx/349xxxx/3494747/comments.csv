,NWE,2007-01-15T21:09Z,"About the lame Virus/Trojan/Porn spam comment-terror:

Come on they're trying to confuse us by telling there are viruses and telling us that there are NO viruses in the comments. Who cares? Download and see for yourself if your antivirus reports!

BSA/MPAA/RIAA/whoever (spammer) tactic:
> Upload appz with virus
> Spam TPB appz comments with ""virus warnings"" and fake statements, to confuse people.
> Sink PirateBay(!)

Will it succeed? Hmm... At least I download and my antivirus checks, as usual. It is rather pathetic after all.."
,softdl,2007-01-19T00:56Z,So I'm guessing you don't need any keys or serial numbers for this or are they all included on the CD somewhere?
,floorman1,2007-01-21T07:35Z,"[IMG]http://i127.photobucket.com/albums/p156/rloyed/Avatars/thanx4upload.gif[/IMG]

Your gonna have complainers with every torrent that is upped,if ya dont wanna have any complaints then just dont up anything..If you have been around pc's for any length of time you will know that some av apps show some things as virus's that other av apps dont."
,floorman1,2007-01-21T07:37Z,"hmmm,the image didnt come thru in my last comment,,it says thanks for the upload"
,doyling,2007-02-07T06:00Z,"Using Avast Free, I get virus hits on key gens for Trendmicro and Avast. Also about 7 hits for Bill Gates All Windows Cracks. 

Nero Premium 7 hits also. 

Scanning with Bit Defender for second opinion.
Bit Defender hit on Anti Product Activation Patch"
,XweAponX,2007-02-19T05:48Z,"""Bit Defender hit on Anti Product Activation Patch""

In other words, the shit does what DJ-DuDu says it does.

As opposed to Bit Defender, which neither defends nor finds actual viruses."
,scotsmokin,2007-06-26T14:49Z,nice work mate .. hope you next one is just as good

,Alup,2007-09-21T15:45Z,Yes! there is a virus in the keygen for AVAST! but once you install AVAST! it is deleted so i dont see what the problem is....
,xiIix,2007-12-22T19:52Z,"Noone needs all this shit. A lot of this software conflicts with eachother. And just to let you know, once a virus does it's job, it doesn't matter if you delete it. The damage is done. Enjoy your false sense of security and lack of common sense."
,smiffo99,2008-06-10T03:50Z,"why are people so damn thick?????????
Any keygen or crack will be picked up with antivirus software AS A VIRUS!!!!  use ur brain... a keygen is an illegal peice of software that antivirus sees as a trojan or virus..IT DOESNT MEAN IT IS A VIRUS!!!!!!!!!!!"
,Floggin,2008-12-16T04:01Z,"I honestly downloaded this just for cheap ass software that isn't worth buying, but then I opened it and read the disclaimer.  Does anyone else think this is a huge joke.   The guy says at the end in so many words that this is his CD and any alterations of this disk will not be tolerated.  I gotta ask this one thing; are you talking about the software you probably illegally obtained and then burned, and completed a rip, or are you talking about the decent launcher?


This dudes a joke for real, he downloaded Cheap ass lame tools that really aren't that great, compiled them on to a image, and now he is taking credit for these shitty companies software.  Dude really, I am thankful for the okay compilation, but come on this CD isn't yours, so to spite you Imma use this launcher and then compile my own then publish it.  I will leave your name crossed out in red, and finish it by adding ""Decimated by Floggin "
,kempd002,2009-01-20T00:44Z,yall are just too dam critical. this dudes just proud of the work he put in to it.WHATS WRONG WITH SOME OF YALL!!!!!
