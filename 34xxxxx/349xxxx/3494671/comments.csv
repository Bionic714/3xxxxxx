,warka000,2006-07-23T08:35Z,After sifting on an ungodly amount of time in the internet and getting my internet screwed in about a hundred different ways I was able to downloaded a 5.1 crack which I think should work with 5.11 because 5.11 is just an upgrade. But since I do not have a program I have no Idea if it will work. If anyone is interested and wants to find out I can upload it. This thing needs more seeds so it can finish quicker and I can verify that it works! x(  !!!
