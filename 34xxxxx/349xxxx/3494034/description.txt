Blurb:  Tarsier's dreamlike vocals match the ambience Alias exudes in his 
        drum-heavy production. Brookland/Oaklyn finds her singing beautifully 
        to the tune of rhythmic beats that never dull through ten tracks of drum
        machines, synthesizers and a chance strumming of the guitar. The album's
        shining achievement, "Dr. C," catches Alias playing guitar, well removed
        from his typical Anticon work. A mid-song entry from the decks keeps the
        song moving. Few moments find Alias & Tarsier as coordinated, but "Dr. C"
        reveals what they do well: combine talented production and dreamlike vocals
        to create an icy atmosphere. (prefixmag.com)
