Trust me, I still know what I'm doing!

It would take more than a nuclear explosion to stop everyone's favourite violence-loving lawman! David Rasche returns - along with co-stars Anne-Marie Martin and Harrison Page - in the surprising (because nobody expected the network to renew it) second season of the series

These are the infamous final episodes featuring such guest stars as Richard Moll, Ray Walston, Edy Williams, Bud Cort, Bernie Kopell, Adam Ant, Davy Jones and more, in the "sitcom for people who hate sitcoms" that remains one of the most dangerously funny shows in TV history.

Episodes comprise:

1. A Clockwork Hammer
2. Big Nazi On Campus
3. Play It Again, Sledge
4. Wild About Hammer
5. The Death Of A Few Salesmen
6. Vertical
7. Dressed To Call
8. Hammer Hits The Rock (a.k.a. Sledge On The Rock)
9. Hammeroid
10. Last Of The Red Hot Vampires
11. Sledge In Toyland
12. Icebreaker
