One Night With Blue Note DVD
When Bruce Lundvall and Michael Cuscuna revived the Blue Note record label in 1985, a reunion concert was held at Town Hall in New York City. The concert brought together some of the most wellknown
names associated with Blue Note and in jazz as well as a handful of artists newly signed to the label.
For over three and a half hours on the night of February 22, 1985 one jazz legend after another took the stage playing classic tunes from the Blue Note catalog. Many regard this event as the greatest single jazz evening ever.
One Night With Blue Note is seeing its first release on DVD and is enhanced with a gallery of famous Blue Note cover art from designer Reid Miles. A collection of stunning black and white studio photography by label co-founder Francis Wolff is also included.
