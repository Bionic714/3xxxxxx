One of the many aliases of German electronic musician Uwe Schmidt (he did an excellent cover of Bowie's Ashes to Ashes under the guise of "LB") this "Senor Coconut" album is a truly great collection of latin versions of Kraftwerk songs! Listen to this and you will almost believe this is a real old Latin lounge band! Brilliant stuff!Se침or Coconut Y Su Conjunto
