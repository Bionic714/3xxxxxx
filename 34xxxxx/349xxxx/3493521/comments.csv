Besides, you're the one with so much time on your hands that you feel the need to look up torrents that you think are ""faggy"" and leave insulting messages on them.

,Dantheman420,2010-04-02T04:04Z,"ive ben downloading this torrent season by season over the last couple of months.....most of the files are really good quality, but theres a few (important) ones that sound and look like crap. its all cool though.....thank you for uploading this massive bitch. 

i dunno y ur all complaining about speed? i alwaise get at least 10Mbps off this torrent"
,tripmix,2010-04-19T23:52Z,"Like a some others here mentioned many of these files are tv rips and suffer from low quality picture and sound, if you are watching on a hdtv with a 5.1 sound system like me it can ruin the whole show. So I thought I'd post my tricks for cleaning up the files.

What you need: MPC (or some media player that can use ffdshow), ffdshow and a bunch of codecs. They can all be installed using the klite codec pack, or you can install them separately. Now open a file in MPC and you should see one blue and one red icon on you taskbar. Double click the red one to bring up the picture setting, on the right there should be a list of checkboxes.

Picture (all files):
Check the postprocessing box, the standard preset is good (mplayer, accurate deblocking)

Now check the resize & aspect box, set specify horizontal size to 1280, set resize always and keep original aspect ratio, check process pixel ratio internally. In the submenu of the resize & aspect option click settings. Set luma method to spline, click the Lock button and set chroma method to spline. Check accurate rounding. 

Now check the blur & NR, set soften to 10, check denoise3d and HQ, uncheck everything else.

(some files)
Check levels, experiment. On my screen most of the files needed 1.1 gamma correction and the white level (arrow on the right) set to 215, some files looked grayish with theses setting, on those files setting the black level (arrow on the left) to 10-12 removed the grayish effect for me.

Note, it is important to check postprocessing before resize and the others after.

Audio (most files) Double click the blue icon.
(these settings are only useful if you output is spdif or hdmi going to an external surround decoder/amplifier) 
Check Dolby decoder.

Check resample.

Click output, check passthrough ac3 and dts. Depending on the capabilities of your external decoder you might want to check ac3 (spdif encode mode and uncheck decode only 5.1).

(some files)
Some files have so bad audio that the above setting only serve to distort the sound. On those files uncheck the above setting and experiment with noise reduction, delay and and swap channels. I'v only just come to season 6 but so far only a few files have needed me to adjust these settings, the files that are out of sync have needed the delay to be between 250 and 350. Only one file so far have needed the front and back speakers to be swapped. Noise reduction is set default to 100, that is good for 90% of the files I've used this setting on, so far only one of these episodes have needed that setting. I think that's everything I've got.

Thanks a lot for upping this and to every one who is seeding."

,ohhman327,2011-06-10T19:29Z,"Great job to original uploader, many thanx...just one small minor problem please dont think im being over critical i just wanted it brought to you attention that the quality of the series finally is not up to par.  Rest of the series before season 7 i think are all dvd rips...but the 7th season is all tv rips and the last episode endgame is just not that good.  it left a bitter tastes especially after getting spoiled by the hiQ previous seasons.  none the less still Aces in my book, keep uploading folks!"
,WingedDrant,2011-07-06T20:38Z,"Episode 11 of Season 6 is replaced with an earlier episode from several seasons earlier, and the quality seems to degrade through the seasons, but this is still a great collection, thanks a lot for uploading."
