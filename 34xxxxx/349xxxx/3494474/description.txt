The Vietnam Veterans - The Days of Pearly Spencer
****************************************************

One of the 80's best garage/psychedelic bands, praised by the alternative music press. Some call it neo-psychedelia, but I would say that they have their completely own music style (even though this term is over-used). Influenced by the 60's, added some really psychedelic organ playing, and finally combined with some great song writing. Check the Trivia/Links for more information.

The Days of Pearly Spencer is a collection of unreleased material, including re-recordings of earlier songs (from their first album 1983). This album is from 1988, and was their final album under the name The Vietnam Veterans.
