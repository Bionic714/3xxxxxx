,gOrzek,2006-06-30T14:11Z,New file (not in the torrent) VroomMulti-Player_2158.zip is available here: http://www.zshare.net/download/vroommulti-player_2158-zip.html
,gOrzek,2006-07-08T14:49Z,I did try posting about stopping seeding a while back. There kept being database errors. Sorry about that.
,gOrzek,2006-07-08T14:50Z,It does seem like the torrent has survived though. So I guess it's all good. I'll keep seeding for a bit now before abandoning it for good. Can't say how long.
,gOrzek,2006-07-16T14:17Z,"Yeah, I actually ended up seeding myself every other day cause my HD is pretty full and I had nothing better to do with my line and felt guilty. ;P"
,gOrzek,2006-07-20T03:19Z,"Alright, this is officially it from my side. I removed the torrent from my computer. Good luck to all of you. I may be back with new stuff some time."
