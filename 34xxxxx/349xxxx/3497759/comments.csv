,Seeg,2006-06-24T08:14Z,HB 3 is stuck at 85%
,MisterSmee,2006-06-25T03:41Z,"Twindad when it says vintage or ""of the past"" that's exactly what it means. Expect VHS quality because that's all that existed when it was filmed. "
,graze151,2009-09-08T02:34Z,great download of some classic ladies. only thing is the clip of Teresa Orlowski didn't work for me. didn't download or something. i get just a blank screen. bummer because that's the one i wanted.
,Ted_Rodgers,2009-09-20T03:44Z,"quality is great for classic vids, the Kimberly Kupps though, o gawd the camera man, director, actor just suck its a poooooorly directed scene, not worth beating off too damn shame too"
