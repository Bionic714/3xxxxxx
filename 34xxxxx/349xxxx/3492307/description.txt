Life Wasted is the first music video to be directed by mixed-media visual artist Fernando Apodaca. In depicting a world both fragile and transitory, Apodaca used life casts of the musicians (transformed and animated through projection techniques) combined with traditional modes of sculpture in bronze, wax and leather.
