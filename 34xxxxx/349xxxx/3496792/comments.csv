,ryangt1,2006-06-20T18:06Z,downloaded this one a while back stil have not found a serial for it
,BritneysOrifice,2006-06-20T18:54Z,"pilotsr and ryangt1:

This is the Wilco CRJ 2004 CD ROM.  All manuals and movies are
included.  WinRAR should produce a file called ""crj200410_snp.iso"".
Use Nero or Alcohol to mount this disc image or burn onto a CD.
The CD should autostart. Use Serial 2JPWV6-BD5ZM64E-TVB772H

Hope this helps.  The CD comes with some extras, too, including a 20 minute tutorial video as well as a 30-minute JustPlanes CRJ vid.  Great package, and a great post.  Seed it for others as it's a worthwhile aircraft."
,pilotsr,2006-06-20T18:59Z,"BritneysOrifice, thanks so much!  That number worked like a charm.  It took me so long to get my hands on this bird I was a bit disappointed when it didn't include a #.  You just made my day, and i'm sure many others as well.

Cheers from NY :)"
,PHBFO,2006-06-20T19:26Z,"He guys, can someone explane me clearly how I can mount an image with Deaom tools?
It would REALLY help me!:-)"
,rikzter7674,2006-06-20T22:54Z,PHBFO I am willing to help you. First after you run the program there should be a Daemon Tools program on the bottom right. Near the time. Then right-click the program and go to Virtual CD/DVD-ROM. A new bar should pop up and go to Device 0: [E:] No media. Another bar should pop up and go to Mount Image. Find the .ISO file and click Open. There you go.

,PHBFO,2006-06-21T15:45Z,Thanks rikzter7674!
,allanssong,2006-06-22T15:10Z,"Nice upload, thanks!

Correct me if I'm wrong. But this is an ISO AND a rippped CD bundled into one RAR file. Thus your downloading the same thing twice?"
,pilotsr,2006-06-22T15:43Z,"Shit, you are quite right.  Slight fuck up on my part and I apologize.  Well its been past around enough and I may repackage it later on.

Enjoy"
,allanssong,2006-06-23T01:00Z,"Not a problem, it's an excellent upload bud.

Wish we had more ISO's of CD shit on here."
