,groovydave1973,2006-06-19T05:01Z,"This is one of the best Dr. Who's I have seen, but I havent seen them all.

It's really funny, its not an episode from the Dr. or Rose's perspective, but a nerdy net blogger who (or what) is chasing the tardis dwellers, so its a bit more off the wall.

It is a Childrens TV show that can be enjoyed by adults..... not the other way round!"
