Surreal, romantic comedy with Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan.

Joe (Hanks) is a man who learns that he has only six months left to live, so he is hired by a superconductor-producing tycoon to jump into a volcano in order to appease the volcano god of a Polynesian island that the tycoon has mining interests in.  On the way there Joe is shipwrecked and falls in love with the tycoon's lovely daughter (Ryan).

It is sort of a blend between D.O.A., Castaway, and Sleepless in Seattle...
