Thanks alot works great on my g3 imac"
,tgcujo,2006-09-10T07:20Z,"Yes this is an image of a mac os9 cd
You just burn it to a cd-r and you have a bootable mac os9 cd.
Then install and welcome to mac os9"

My mac is broken... That`s Why i Need this software..."
,tgcujo,2006-10-20T07:46Z,"You should be able to.
Its just a iso disk image so your need software to burn it to a cd

,tgcujo,2006-10-20T07:47Z,"by the way
when you place the burned cd in your mac it boots mac os from the cd(its kind of slow for normal use) then you install mac os or you can repair your disk etc from the cd"

The problem is I have downloaded OS 10.4 onto a Powerbook and then burned to a DVD which my old iMac will read but then it can't open the install OSX icon.  Any suggestions how I can do this?  I can't load it on my old iMac as I don't have OSX so I can't seem to use piratebay to get the torrent, that is why I download them on my PowerPC G4."

I downloaded this torrent, and used Toast to make a copy to install on my g3 iBook that currently has only 10.3 installed on it.  Now what?

That was stuck in a loop that I had to do a force shut down on."

,nch8,2007-01-17T11:00Z,does anyone have any idea how to install this into a post 2005 powerbook with the os9 icon in the preferences panel. I already burned the toast file to a disk and rebooted and it still does nothing.
,nch8,2007-01-17T11:31Z,"among other things, has this worked for anyone else who runs osx. if so what should the name of the cd be? ""MacOS 9 retail.toast"", ""MacOS 9 retail.iso"", ""MacOS.iso"" etc etc....

to boot from the CD drive you shut down, hold down 'C' and press the power button with 'C' held down."

my old mac cube broke down a few months ago and it wouldn't start. an official apple shop told me i needed to replace the motherboard (which costs a LOT of money)... yesterday, for some strange reason, i thought ""let me try start it up""... guess what, it did... only that it has a USB configuration problem that won't allow me to use the mouse or keyboard... what f***ing bastards... a new motherboard, they said... after 16 years of buying macs, i am starting to hate apple as much as i hate microsoft...

,scmarcos!,2007-02-19T02:13Z,"I really wonder if this will work for me.
I bought a used ""mirrored drive doors"" (G4 1 GHz Dual) and I can't boot OS 9 anymore.

This is what Apple tells you about the issue:

""These computers are supported by the version of Mac OS included with the computer when it was purchased; retail copies of Mac OS with the same (or earlier) version number may not include the system software components necessary to start up these models.""

,runic,2007-03-31T03:04Z,"veraeq17, a .toast file is usually opened with Toast, a Mac program. I've never had to use one with my PC, but apparantly 7-zip can open them (I can't confirm this, though). Dunno, they're basically an .iso file (try renaming, some people say that works). DMGs are disk images, and act like an actual disc when opened on a Mac, just like an .iso or .toast (if you have Toast). Your average Windows PC doesn't support the mounting of disc image files as a physical CD, but I've heard a lot about DMG2ISO, which can convert the .dmg files you keep finding into .iso files, which can be mounted/burnt by Nero or Alchohol 120%. But unless it's system software, you won't find much use in that, Mac applications are Mac-only. 

""Then I have this folder: __MACOSX

with this inside..

._Mac OS 9 Retail.toast ""

Those are folders that would be hidden on a Mac, just like we can see your hidden files like thumbs.db. You won't find anything in them :P

Basically, try renaming the .toast file to .iso, burn it to a CD, put the updates on a CD (unless you have internet to the Mac, then you can download them), pop the CD in the Mac, and see if it'll boot from the CD. If it will, you can install.

And to those people trying to install this on any G4 Mac (except the 1Ghz Powerbook), don't bother, those models don't support booting into OS 9, and for Classic this won't work because it's not 9.2.2, and you can't install the updates seperately. Try looking elsewhere if you just need classic (lots of 9.2.2 disk images out there). This is for those that can boot it and emulators (like Sheepshaver) only!

i_am_ninjasmurf, I have the same file and the .toast image mounts fine as Mac OS 9. It's 9.0, or at most 9.0.4, or you wouldn't need the updates ;) "
,imacmatt09,2007-04-13T00:41Z,Someone post an http mirror please!!
,parachutebradleyy,2007-04-16T09:18Z,"Renaming the file does work.

Just extract it in WinRAR (not winzip, theres no renaming capabilities in that software) and make sure you close your .torrent downloader, and right click and rename the .toast to .iso and burn it in nero."
,parachutebradleyy,2007-04-16T09:34Z,(that was for people downloading this on a PC)
,Old Mac Geezer,2007-05-25T03:53Z,"gibme,

You have to hold down C to boot from an OS disc. Did you do that?

scmarcos!,

Does your machine have Firewire 800 ports? The Firewire 800 model is the first Mac to not allow booting in anything but OS X. There's nothing you can do about it. You can only run 9 in classic mode. "
,Old Mac Geezer,2007-05-25T03:57Z,"Abandonware,

The 9600 will run 9, but only up to 9.1 officially. You would need OS9 Helper to get 9.2.x running. You have to have some version of 9 already installed for  OS9 Helper to run. You can google for the file, it's not hard to find. Be aware, though, that no OS before X supports multiple processors. Selected applications may have extensions for multiple processors, like Photoshop, but if the software doesn't have an extension, the extra processor just sits there. "

,adcurtin,2008-08-11T07:08Z,"I don't know why this was uploaded in its current condition, but its garbage. The OS9 install disk is european english (as already mentioned), but the updates are for US english version only, so you can't use both on the same computer, you'll need a different version of OS9 if you want to use the updates, or a different version up the updates to use with this version. The updates are quite possibly somewhere on Apple's site."
,mjlar94,2008-09-02T05:27Z,"For some reason I have no luck with it. I can dir cd:,\ and see the contents, but it won't boot. Also UltraISO says ""Unsupported block size, HFS will be skipped"".

,Critical_Hit,2008-09-05T22:58Z,"Thanks for the Distro!

For PC users: Using winrar, double click and open the file,  extract the OS9.toast file (~6** MB), rename it to OS9.iso.

burn to a regular CD-r (Not CD-rw, no patterned discs etc...)  you can use IMGburn to do this (it is free and it worked for me)

I have confirmed that this will boot, and install in Blue and white G3 towers using this method.

holding the ""c"" key does not work for me and neither do most other keyboard commands. Im convinced its how the disc is burnt, I just can't seem to get it to work. I have been using cd-r's for this.
