The brainchild of German keyboardist Elmar Schulte, this recording 
entity is based in the small town of Paderborn, yet draws inspiration 
from foreign landscapes, particularly the wide open spaces of the 
American Southwest, Scotland, and Norway. Schulte named the 
group, in fact, after his admiration for the music on Desert Solitaire, 
an album by American New Age synthesists Steve Roach, Kevin 
Braheny, and Michael Stearns. Solitaire's dark, textural pieces and 
occasional ethnic rhythms are a marked contrast to the sequencer-
dominated heritage of the '70s German electronic New Age Music 
popularized by Tangerine Dream and Klaus Schulze.
