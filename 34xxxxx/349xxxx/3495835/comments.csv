looks like 2003 with sp1 slipstreamed rather than r2


Read the eula.txt on cd1. That's the only file that differs from 2003 sp1. (Apart from all the extras on cd2 of course...)"

,Gambit_642,2006-10-06T09:56Z,"You guys need to read a damn artical on what your warez'ing.  R2 is bassically M$ taking all pathes and SP's and rolling them together in one CD and calling R2 (to sell the sage shitty product again).  This is R2 (32-Bit), and it is Enterprise Edition and Volume Lisence, so you dont have to worry about  activation, but you do need a corp key for that isnt blacklisted to pull webupdates."

,JasonKruser2,2006-12-29T08:57Z,ok...this isn't corporate....R2 is just windows server with a huge update package.  the serial is included in a NFO file which is a text file with a .NFO extension.  no there isn't a swedish version of this :S.  YES the serial is in the NFO file

Themes need to be activated...
Start --> Administrative Tools --> Services
Right click ""Themes"" left click ""Properties""
Change ""Startup type"" to Automatic
Start the service.       "
