,Tigonist,2006-06-23T18:04Z,"Thanks for the upload. Dont mean to be ungrateful, but this is going slooow."
,PhilGrim,2006-06-25T09:06Z,"Sorry, my ISP has capped my upload for the remainder of the month! Remember if you are willing to seed I can send out DVD.

Who is the best parent episode is not included on the official DVD for some strange reason, thats why its not included."
,run3,2006-06-25T13:29Z,Could you please make a DVD-ISO and upload it? I'm sure many would appreciate it! :)
,PhilGrim,2006-06-29T09:50Z,"Just an update: Almost finished seeding one whole copy: hopefully it will start to spread now.

Also; the episodes that aren't included aired with season 2 on CBS. Seeing as CBS authored the DVD its probable the two missing eps will be on the season 2 dvd."
,DerrtyJake,2006-07-02T19:43Z,There's 3 seeders and most of us are around 99.4%. One of those seeders just get on. We're only like 2 megs away.
,DerrtyJake,2006-07-02T19:51Z,"The two missing are stripper and parent. They're not on the season one DVD. Quit worrying about it. This is the only Kenny vs. Spenny torrent you can find that still has seeders and no Swedish Subs.

Ans for that dude looking for DVD ISOs check out this link - http://www.isohunt.com/torrents.php?ihq=kenny+spenny&ext=&op=and

The ones in blue are the DVDs. There's 3 discs."
,PhilGrim,2006-07-03T06:14Z,"seems the torrent is stuck at 99.9%? What file isn't 100% done I might need to reup it.
"
,DerrtyJake,2006-07-08T22:26Z,Grim email me back man. I'll create the torrent for you.
,fluffmoln,2006-09-12T14:56Z,"Hey, the last piece of the 99.9% thing is the last bit of episode 124 and the ReadMe.txt. Would be sweet if we could get all of this goodie."
,crispy242,2008-01-05T18:11Z,"Please seed, there are about 45 of us stuck at 99.9%!.

Thanks for uploading this Grim!"
