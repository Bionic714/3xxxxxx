This is an alcohol 120% mds/mdf of the hard to find Hd Advance 3.
PAL CD version, burned it back to cdr using alcohol again and verified it worked on my ps2.
As soon as i can get my hands on a dvdrom that can fast skip errors i'll upload the dvd version too, i know it's not really needed if you have a modchip but i'll up it just for completeness.


This is for those of you with modchips, if you don't have one installed you need some kind of swaptrick to boot this, if you're planning on buying swap magic or anything like that to boot this you might just go ahead and buy this instead.
