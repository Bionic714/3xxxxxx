 If any of you that got this before could help reseed this, it would be appreciated."
,4X-AXG,2006-06-18T17:53Z,"I'll download and seed, thanks :)"
,rrodger99,2006-06-18T18:31Z,Thanks 4X
,rrodger99,2006-06-18T20:01Z,"Yes
I already had the cd version of version 1 installed, I installed version 2 over it & it worked fine.
"
,rikzter7674,2006-06-19T12:42Z,"So after I installed 4X-AXG, I install this one?"
,4X-AXG,2006-06-19T15:48Z,"rrodger,

I am somewhat confused. I think the 727 on this CD IS V2 and not V1. For one, the installer size is 125 MB; exactly the size of the V2 installer I posted earlier"
,4X-AXG,2006-06-19T15:48Z,"Also, one of the main differences between V1 and V2 is the addition of several different models (Super 27, winglets, etc) and this installer HAS those additional models.
so, I think the 727 on this CD-ROM is V2! :)"
,rikzter7674,2006-06-19T18:51Z,Guys this torrent works. First I downloaded and installed 4X-AXG's 727. Then I installed rrodger99's 727 and it works.
,rrodger99,2006-06-20T04:43Z,"looking at the version #s for both installers, they are both 2.0.0.24.

I am getting too old to keep up with all this crap.

Sorry to those that downloaded a bunch for nothing."
,rrodger99,2006-06-20T04:45Z,"Oh ye....good eye there 4X

At least we got what we wanted in the long run...;)"

,alosh747,2006-10-31T20:59Z,"describing my experience!  with best thanks to rrodger 99 for his efort in cracking this wounderful bird,after downloading this torrent,and mounting with alcohol,despite message of file protection: the program was able to run in fs9 but stop working after TO.  I NOTICED THE MAIN PROBLEM IS DUE TO LIVERY PACK INSTALLATION,IF ONLY INSTALL LIVERY PACK1,THE PROGRAM WILL RUN PROPERLY. DON'T CHANGE CONFIGURATION WIZARD,RESET IT & DISABLE VC.
i could get better result by installing livery paks(1,2) from other torrent(black 8). do abovementioned advice for config. manager.
it works excellent for me! hope works for other guys & could fly with this virgin!!!"
