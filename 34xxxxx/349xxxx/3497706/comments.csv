,Tourniquest,2006-06-27T18:42Z,"The file system on the disc is corrupt and it cannot be opened in DVDFab Decrypter, DVD Shrink or DVDReMake Pro. It might be playable in you DVD player if you burn the image as is."
,Tourniquest,2006-06-27T18:43Z,"You can fix the movie in IfoEdit, however. This is how - Copy all files beginning with VTS_10 to a separate folder. Open VTS_10_0.IFO in IfoEdit. In the VOB Extras menu, select Create new IFOs, and save them to the same folder. Rename VTS_10_1.VOB through VTS_10_5.VOB to VTS_01_1.VOB, VTS_01_2.VOB, ... VTS_01_5.VOB. Delete the remaining VTS_10 files. And, voila, you have a fully working movie-only disc. Or you could buy it, if that seems simpler. :)"

HOW TO FIX THIS TORRENT
...............................

It is very simple, much easier than Tourniquest said.  Unpack the image using Winrar and Isobuster (just google them, both have free versions, you can use 7-zip instead of winrar).

After the image is unpacked, download Ifoedit, and open up VTS_10_0.IFO inside Ifoedit.

Click ""Get VTS sectors.""  And it asks if you want to fix all IFO files, just click yes.  It will tell you it found an error and fixed it (yay).  And that's it.
