,Mr_Ecks,2006-06-24T21:40Z,Seeing Natalie Portman in this movie makes really unconfortable getting a hard on seeing her in other movies...
,Halbermunken,2006-06-24T22:55Z,Her best acting on this one. Same with Jean Reno. Excellente!
,antiterrorstyrkan,2006-06-25T02:28Z,I kind of get one here too.. oh well. :p
,k-t-m,2006-06-25T02:56Z,"Wait a minute... This isn't recompressed in any way, right? Isn't the whole point of ""Superbit"" having as much data as possible on the disc, to get the best image possible? Man, if I'd have bought this and found they left 2GB unused, I think I'd be pissed... Anyways, thanks for the up."
,antiterrorstyrkan,2006-06-25T18:09Z,"@k-t-m. there is an upper bitrate to consider for DvD too. and don't confuse 2 GB with 2000000000 bytes.

,Sarethi,2006-10-08T01:08Z,"Good stuff! This is the best version of LĂŠon available, execpt perhaps the french 136min version, but that one isn't on sale anywhere from what I've seen and I don't think it has DTS!
Thanks so much for this upload, I hope I can get this baby down in a few days and I will seed this forever. LĂŠon is the THE movie."
,saucepan,2006-11-04T15:02Z,"If it's you who's seeding, Sarethi - keep it coming! I need this movie... of course I will seed it forever too :D"
,saucepan,2006-11-11T11:25Z,"It appears that, two days after writing the above, whoever was seeding decided to stop. Sadastic bastard. Right, I'm stuck on 54.3%, can I get a reseed?"

As long as it's the international version and DVD quality, I ain't fussed."
