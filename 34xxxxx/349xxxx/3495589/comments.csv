inside you choose for ""armadillo"" (2nd on the icon list) 


should work after you load it

,woicer,2006-09-11T21:11Z,"HJÄLP! Jag gjorde misstaget att installera en demo-version innan, och nu kan jag inte starta den här. Hur kan jag göra? Jag hittar ingen lösning!"
,Swedishbanshee,2006-09-23T16:04Z,"Hello, to solve problem with this getting locked if you had Demo version installed. Just simply open Regeditor. (Click on start then Run then write regedit). In regeditor you press Ctrl+F and Write Fraps and press search, then delete the file you get marked then press F3 and delete and repeat until done."
