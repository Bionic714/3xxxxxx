thanx a lot for the anapod explorer. however, need to ask a couple of questions;

i couldnt install it - when i plug the ipod in, and get to the anapod explorer, it asks me to activate the thing but the whole thing is grayed out so i cant even register it manually. any ideas?

the other thing is it wont let me uninstall it - comes up with an error message that says the installer is damaged or corrupted - do u know of any way i could uninstall it? thanx

,anarxis,2007-09-29T07:49Z,"you have to add ""/NCRC"" at the end of the installer.

Right click the uninst.exe file and add /NCRC at the end. Like this... That should work as the installer then skips the CRC check.

""C:\Program Files\Red Chair Software\Anapod Explorer\uninst.exe"" /NCRC

The first question i dont know anything about. Did you use the crack included? That kinda removes the activation thingy..."
