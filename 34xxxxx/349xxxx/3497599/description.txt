Simply the best and only usable alternative to iTUNES that i know...
This version is 8.9.6. 

The only problem was that the installer had expired, but i patched out the exit routine, so now it just nags you, but it will install. If you click on the installer itself, it will nag you about corrupted installer. Just click the shortcut and it will work. It adds a /NCRC (no CRC check) to the installer. $

You have to use the included crack after. I only patched out the installer expiring stuff.

Supports ALL iPods out there...  And you can COPY from your iPod to the PC as well!!!
