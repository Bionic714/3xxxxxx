The download is stopped. Please let us help people.
Let's do ""The Pirate Bay"" but grow ever, and be the best of all. For that to happen, we must have good torrents to download and have good rates of Seeders / Leechers."
,Duduzaum,2008-04-19T01:49Z,"In my home, the download stopped in 17%.
PLEASE SEED. We need your help. One helps the other, and will help us helped."
,LongLivePiracy,2008-06-22T23:32Z,"Yeah Gettysburg doesn't work.
SMGET.RAR is missing an archive,
so it doesn't work when I try to unpack the game.
Pissed me off cus I waited like 4 freaking weeks.
So damn and such and does any one have help?"
,mykill100,2008-07-10T12:28Z,Dont bother trying to download this trash because the fool as used a file splitter to split the wrahs then used the file spliter again to split the first wrah thinking he will get the whole game more compressed or something. The result is that when you unzip a collection of split wrahs you get the first and only the first of the original split wrahs so when you attempt to unzip that the zipper asks for the next wrah in sequence which isnt there. For example ID4 is over 250mb in size did the guy really believe he compressed it to 1.5mb. Dont waste your time on this.
,hlt,2008-11-05T17:06Z,"Seesh... to all you bitching mofo's:

[YELL]THESE ARE THE ORIGINAL FILES FROM BBS'S THAT DISTRIBUTED THE FILES BACK WHEN THEY WERE RELEASED.[/YELL]

Now, if you can not handle these old compression/split techniques that was used back then don't download. And, if there was a virus in the original release - there is a virus in this pack as well. Keeping the public with antivirus apps is not my responsibility.

Won't upload any more of these, problem solved."
,wincy,2010-07-16T09:12Z,thx to whoever is still seeding this! i\'ll have it in like 2 hrs...hope Gettysburg works
