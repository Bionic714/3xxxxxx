your ripped version of this didn't stay seeded for very long. I'm stuck @ 91.3% and those who got it 100% bailed, so disapointed, why no one is willing to keep a torrent alive...... beats me *bumbed*"

,greenup,2006-09-06T22:09Z,"I'm pretty much new at this.  I downloaded and installed the required software for the toorent for this file; However I'm having a few problems hopefully someone can help me with.  When I open the software and the torrent, the download for this file is extremely slow.  I have internet cable.  Also during the download process the downl;oad will stop.  I've proceeded to do the NAT test and I get an okey and sometimes an error on port 61885.  Also I understand that I need to upload some software in order to download. My problem is I don't have any new software, excpet maybe visual C ++ and a ADA Compiler whcih is basically free.  I like the aircraft.  I would like to do my part.  PLEASE HELP and thanks for your time and patience.
