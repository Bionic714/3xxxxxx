PLOT SUMMARY 1
==============
Weird yummy goo erupts from the earth and is discovered by a couple of miners. They taste it and decide to market it because it tastes so good. The American public literally eats up the new dessert known as The Stuff but, unfortunately, it takes over the brains of those who eat it, turning them into zombie-like creatures. It is up to ex-FBI agent David Rutherford and a kid named Jason to stop the spread of the mind-devouring dessert.


PLOT SUMMARY 2
==============
The industrial spy and former FBI agent David 'Mo' Rutherford (Michael Moriarty) is hired by executives of the ice-cream industry to disclose the receipt of the successful marshmallow desert called "The Stuff". Their consumers become addicted in the product, and the competitors want the formula. With the support of Nicole (Andrea Marcovicci), the promoter of The Stuff, and the boy Jason (Scott Bloom), `Mo' tries to prove that The Stuff is apparently an alien being trying to dominate the mind of the population of Earth.
