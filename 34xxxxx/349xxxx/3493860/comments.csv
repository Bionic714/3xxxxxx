,Fighter_92,2006-10-09T07:59Z,Two weeks? How did you do that? I have downloaded 45% in two days.
,kimaasen,2006-10-11T13:00Z,"It's really, really bad seeding on this one. Usually the DL-speed is between 1kb/sec to 5kb/sec, but sometimes (not very often) it jumps up to ~50-100kb/sec.

I've been downloading/uploading for about 2-3 weeks now, and I'm soon at 84% >"
,Peter Pampers,2006-10-12T15:52Z,"Thanks for sharing :D
Does anyone else have a problem viewing the episodes? My mediaplayer (Windows) says wrong codec, but i have not beeb able to find any working codec. Is it because all 10 seasons have not been fully downloaded? It is only 50% complete, but it looks as if many of the episodes are finished, judging from their size :)"
,emilian,2006-10-13T19:58Z,i will be very angry if the epiodes do not work and i wonder most i have some codes or something to se the episodes ??

,Dry Ice,2006-10-14T13:54Z,"To Peter Pampers:
Download VLC Media Player
That works with almost every file-format."
,svenie,2006-10-19T00:00Z,"Nice ^^
