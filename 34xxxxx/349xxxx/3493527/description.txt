Dear Penis. 

You get it in .MP3 (send it to your phone if u have MP3 player on it), 
.AVI (music video, cant send to phone)
And a bonus, if u want the music video on you phone, you get this in .3GP too..

.3GP is a format that many cell phones understand, so than u can see it on the phone.

So, u get it in

.MP3
.AVI
.3GP
