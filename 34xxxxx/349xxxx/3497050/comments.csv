,mokja,2006-06-21T23:40Z,"seed please, not wierd no one have downloaded it!"
,Morinaren,2006-06-22T00:16Z,"Moron! I upoaded it this morning.. That's probably why no one has downloaded it yet!

PS. I am seeding!"
,mokja,2006-06-23T00:45Z,I'we downloaded it now. It ses i need a new patch. Where can i get one?
,godmagnus,2006-06-23T05:03Z,Trying to mount cd2. Renamed to mir-wh40kwb.bin and .cue  Does not mount. I am the only one having this problem?
,mokja,2006-06-23T17:18Z,Try to mount the other file. There is more than the Cue one
,Morinaren,2006-06-25T00:43Z,"If you mount through daemon tools the drop down should be set to images only.. This way you'll get the right one as there is only one (by d tools recognizable) image in each map.

To summon it up, do not change the file names!!"
,felix_1992,2006-07-02T13:14Z,"i couldnt find the crack, can i have the link to it?"
,Morinaren,2006-07-03T00:38Z,"And on more thing (and I can't state this enough), When you install winter assault (with dawn of war already installed ofcourse) the winter assault installer WILL install the correct patches before the installation process of the game proceeds! I don't mean to be an ass but I seriously can't see how you managed to mess that up?!"
,Raideraid,2006-07-25T10:40Z,Man We need some more seeders!
,Met-Fighter,2006-08-01T10:16Z,ive downloaded it 2x but the cd2 image couldnt mount!  when i tried there was a massage: unable  to mount. file npt accessable 
,Tricket56,2006-08-15T18:22Z,if i have a downloaded version of the original dawn of war can i still install this? (ie will it work with a pirated version of the original?)
,Ghotcom,2006-08-28T18:31Z,"Morinaren : thank you for sharing this torrent, but why the hell didn t you make .iso images for both cds. ISO is the industry standard for cd filesystems while BWI is used for adding copy protection information whatelse to the cd. As a pirate you don't need it anymore:P so drop it next time"
,Ghotcom,2006-08-28T18:37Z,"Tricket: As far as I know, pirating is just the action of stealing  a game -to get a copy of it !!. So unless you cracked the .exe, you can work with either of the copies."
,Ghotcom,2006-08-30T14:43Z,"Has anyone ever been able to play it online ? I tried many keygen's but It keeps on saying ""CD authentication failed"" "
,V for Vendetta,2006-09-07T20:35Z,"yea im having trouble with cd 2 as well, what do u do when it says please insert cd2 cause u cant mount the files in the cd2 folder!"
,Morinaren,2006-09-07T21:46Z,"You're having trouble with cd2?? That's a new one.. It's a bin file! Just mount the cue!

I honestly can't see why you make it so hard?!:
1. Run daemon tools (Computer must be running)
2. Select Virtual CD/DVDrom ---> Device [?]:
3. Browse dow-winter assault and open ""CD1""
4. Select (in the drop-down) ALL IMAGES
5. If you follow these steps you should only see ONE file to choose! Do so!
6. The CD menu will now appear on your screen
7. Select ""INSTALL""
8. When prompted, mount CD2 (just as we practiced)

-------------
That's it people... I really can't make it more clear than that.. Should anyone not be able to install the game now.. Then don't bother. You should be out flipping burgers or something!"
,Morinaren,2006-09-07T21:56Z,"PS. @ Ghotcom:

You actually do not need to crack winter assault.
And you CAN run this pirated version of winter assault with a store purchased version of dawn of war! Your copy of dawn of war must however be v.1.40 or higher to work with winter assault!"
,Drezzster,2006-09-08T12:26Z,"sorry but it still isn't working for me either... I get half way through the install when it asks for the other cd. I then try to mount the .cue file from the CD2 folder and I get the message: unable to mount image, File not accessable.
"
,Drezzster,2006-09-08T12:32Z,"ah never mind ive done it, one of the file names whas missing an ""h"""
,V for Vendetta,2006-09-09T14:57Z,"yea same man there was also the ""h"" missing on mine, thx anyaway Morinaren "
,yarrmatey,2006-09-14T00:01Z,"To give a better explination, here's what I had to do to get it to install:

1. RENAME the files in CD2 to the following;
     mir-wh40kwb.bin
     mir-wh40kwb.cue

2.  Use Daemon to mount the ONLY file available in the CD1 folder.  You should select the ""view all files"" option from the drop-down menu when you are mounting.

3.  When it asks for CD2, select the same drive you just had CD1 mounted to, browse into CD2 and mount the .cue file.

4.  This SHOULD allow the rest of the install.  It worked for me anyhow and I'm a n00b at this."
,mediccody,2006-09-21T03:25Z,"Alright, at first I was having this exact same problem as everyone else with trying to mount the .bin for CD2. The problem here is that the file you need to mount is mir-wh40kwb.CUE, NOT mir-wh40kwb.BIN

If you are using Daemon Tools to emulate the Winter Assault CD2, then click mount image, then where it says ""Files of Type: All images..."", click and change to ""All files,"" and mount mir-wh40kwb.cue 

Make sure to use the same drive for CD2 as you were using for CD1 or the installer will not accept."
,mediccody,2006-09-21T18:12Z,"Also, I'm aware that this image will not work for online play, but is it possible to install multiple copies for LAN play?"
,Ghotcom,2006-09-25T03:05Z,"I believe local multiplayer mode works.

Morinaren:

Well, I am not running Windows and related virtual CD/DVD creator supporting all PROPRIETARY CD/DVD filesystems like BIN/CUE, but Linux. Linux supports industry standard CD ISO format ; if I want to use formats like the one you provided I need to convert it to ISO first, which is either difficult or impossible depending on the format. That, and as I have said there is no need for copy-protection data (included in BIN/CUE) once you have cracked it !!
Voila, so if you could do this next time it would be perfect"
,Freeze322,2006-09-26T14:16Z,"Mine doesnt work, I did the readme said, but when I run DOW:WA, it says: Original disc could not be found or authenticated. :("
,Freeze322,2006-09-28T15:51Z,can someone help plzzzz?
,EroticDoom,2006-10-03T09:47Z,"Sorry for this noob question:

What do i need to label the 2nd CD.

i have tried CD2 and DoW_2 , but everytime it asked for Dawn of War-Winter Assault Disk 2 , it fails to find it."
,lost_cause,2006-10-11T17:36Z,"i downloaded doW from this website, but wen i tried  to install this expansion the setup program tries to autopatch n then it says ""warning u r trying to patch the wrong version of doW"". any ideas????"
,Morinaren,2006-10-17T23:20Z,@ lost_cause: You are trying to patch a game with a cracked exe.. Reinstall dawn of war and then winter assault before you crack dow!
,Lindblood,2006-10-20T18:34Z,"Hmmm...
I get the File not accesible error when i try to add or mount  the cue-file from cd 2.

I have rename the files in the CD2 folder.

I use daemon tool v.4.06HE."
,Lindblood,2006-10-20T23:00Z,"Hmm... I my files seems to be corrupt. I'll download them again and then we'll se if the problem is persistent.

Sally HO!"
,Lindblood,2006-10-23T15:37Z,Heh - i actually was able to mount the bin file. So there isn't a problem  - only those damn Chaos cultists...
,the_doctor666,2007-01-23T11:02Z,"Hmm. I was wondering if anyone could send me a copy of the .cue file. I had a minor accident with my own.

Thanks"
,biozork,2007-02-03T11:13Z,Is it possible someone can help seeding this one. It suddently got popular again with the dow:dark crusade released... :)
,barcedude,2007-04-08T22:40Z,"when i downloaded the torrent and tried to play online, it said ""cd authenticaiton failed"". i saw that another dude, Ghotcom, on this forum had teh same forum. can anybody help me out to play online 

THANKS"
,undeadonly,2007-04-08T23:16Z,"why oh why did I downloaded 1,3GB of exp dawn of war..... and I only got the 500MB cd1 of winter assault -.-'' I downloaded it whole day!"
,gozonuts,2007-04-16T00:18Z,"What the fuck? Your stupid directions are as clear as mud! Could you maybe be a little more detailed? Nothing you say works,  nor is any of it intuitive - jackass!"
,Twinked,2007-05-09T16:14Z,"I had to rename the file in CD2 from .bin.bin to just .bin

After that it works perfect - no cracks or anything needed!"
,Morinaren,2007-06-28T04:31Z,Okay! If there are any idiots left out there who still cannot get this game to work then you should know that I have a nephew at the age of three who succeeded in installing this game! lewz0rz!!
,hoho330,2007-09-16T10:59Z,"Does this one work with multiplayer?
I have the original game, DOW, but no expansion packs."
,doggsmo,2007-09-17T21:49Z,"I have a problem with this one..... It says that it cant mount cd2! Help please.

Jag har ett problem.... Deamon tools vill inte mounta cd2! Hjälp tack..."
,TheElholn,2007-09-18T15:41Z,"Alright, at first I was having this exact same problem as everyone else with trying to mount the .bin for CD2. The problem here is that the file you need to mount is mir-wh40kwb.CUE, NOT mir-wh40kwb.BIN

Hot this one from mediccody

Hes a good person"
,penguin5201,2007-10-02T00:49Z,"If your having problems with your CD2 bin not being found, rename it to MIR-WH40KWB.BIN

,Zeetzu,2008-06-17T22:53Z,"Just one thing... SCREW those damned things about renaming when it can't find the second disc! One guy told me to mount the ISO-files one, by one... Moung the first, then go to [My computer:\F:\] Then you copy all the files into a folder, unmount the disc and mount the second, copy all the files into the same folder as before.. and so on with the third.. (If there's any)"
,Zeetzu,2008-06-17T22:55Z,Mount* :)
,Zeetzu,2008-06-17T22:58Z,"""what can i do so i can play??""
Easy, you'll have to patch the game, go to www.filefront.com to find the patches (Oh, and install them all, one by one..) Don't just go for th latest directly! =)"
,ChiePet,2008-06-26T19:49Z,"Fine, kcr0s5, I will seed but if you are only getting 8 kbps your connection is the problem, not the torrent.  I got over 600 kbps on this, and it's only a couple minutes away from finishing.  "
,recognition21,2008-07-13T07:40Z,"For the idiots that dont know how to read, this torrent works perfect if you do everything right though you need to *manually* change a few things

Rename the files in CD2 so there is an 'h' after the 'w' which spells.........'w'ar'h'ammer, get it?
    delete the extra bin as well

You would know this already if you actually read through peoples instructions, hope this helps anyone who only reads the most recent comments"
,Cell^,2008-07-27T03:10Z,"I had the same problem as many of you, not being able to mount the cd 2 .cue file when asked for it. I renamed the files like it said in the info. So the cd 2 files was renamed to ""mir-wh40kwb.bin"" and ""mir-wh40kwb.cue"" now i don't know if i was supposed to include .bin and .cue in the name but it did. That didn't work, so i tried alot of stuff to try and get it to work, then at last i got daemon tools to accept the cd 2 .cue file by renaming both files (again) to just ""mir-wh40kwb"" so no .bin and .cue in the file name this time and that finally did it."
,jrsuperstar,2008-08-01T22:34Z,"yo, im new to all this,

,TillerFTW,2009-05-26T13:13Z,"help please? 

also to the people trying to install CD2, if you get a window that says File not Accessible just mount .bin instead of .cue

 mount the image with daemon tools lite
 when he ask for the second disc, mount the BIN,not the cue, then just finish the instalation and go find a crack and play,more easy than steal a candy from a baby"
