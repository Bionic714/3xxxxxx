,MoonShine12,2006-08-14T19:32Z,"Could you guys give me a console command to get this working?
I downloaded it but it doesn't work straight away on my level 21, but yet on a previous save on my level 11 it works, as do the others (horse armor, Vile Lair, Mehrunes Razor, Frostcrag Spire).
Frostcrag Spire is the only one that works on my level 21.
:( Thaks if you can help"

C:\Program\Bethesda Softworks\Oblivion\Data or wherever you have the game, and click Data Files instead of Play when you open Oblivion, then mark the plugin you want to use by clicking in its box. Then it should be applied to the game and work."
