,girlguidebiscuit,2007-04-17T22:15Z,"PLEASE, HOW DO WE GET PAST THE PURCHASE SCREEN??"
,PissedOff3,2007-06-13T13:15Z,Easiest way to get past the buy screen is to submit your card details and pay for it rather than steal.
,kdev,2008-01-24T15:19Z,"easiest way to get people to pay for it is to make it affordable. I could spend 50,000 USD at Flight1.com right now and still be wanting more. The Pirate Bay et al will never die, so you should just shut the fuck up and move on continuing to contribute nothing at all to society but a complaint about SOMEONE else ""stealing"" SOMEONE ELSES software. Once again, shut the fuck up. Bitch."
