 ³ Yes, we are back again. We've been watching the game scene for a while and ³
 ³ decided to bring back some quality to it.                                  ³
 ³ We might not release as often  as we did years ago, but we will  bring you ³
 ³ stuff that others cannot or don't want to release.                         ³

 ³ Five years ago it was the RIAA doing blowjobs on the FBI, two years ago it ³
 ³ was the IFPI doing blowjobs on the Norwegian Police and a few weeks ago it ³

 ³ But we are still here, no matter how many servers your  bribed   policemen ³
 ³ seize  or people your  corrupt  judges sentence.                           ³
 ³ We are millions you estranged yourselves from.  We have had more downloads ³

,elvispresley,2007-02-04T12:38Z,"I need some help when I try to burn the image using Nero burner, a message pop up saying ""problems with loading cue sheet""

Anyone else got this problem?"
,Uriziel,2007-02-20T21:37Z,"Hey guys we need seeds, too many people stuck @ 99.8% so please seed!"
,randeny,2007-03-03T18:30Z,"Hi, I have the same problem trying to burn an image. Anyone else have any luck? I was looking forward to trying this game."
,Plasma_Kat,2008-04-13T05:22Z,"Heres the solution to the problems you'll get with the image: Open the .cue file with a text editor like notepad and look at the line that says ""FILE"". Delete the text after ""razor1911"" but leave the "".bin"" at the end, so the full line in inverted commas reads ""Combat_Mission_Afrika_Korps.Razor1911.bin""

Save it and it will work."
