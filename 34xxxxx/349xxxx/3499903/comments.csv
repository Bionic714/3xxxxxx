,DonHagenbuch,2006-07-01T08:44Z,"what a pity adobe dropped framemaker for os x.

is this framemaker+sgml?"
,ratthing,2006-07-04T15:02Z,"They were stupidly pushing InDesign as the ""replacement"" for Framemaker.  Idiots.

For the person asking about Framemaker for Windows, it's on the All Adobe DVD, just search TPB for Framemaker:

,konelli,2006-08-04T10:25Z,"Could someone seed this again? I've been at 96.68% for weeks now and the last bits just won't come through. I promise to keep my client running until the end of the month or until there are no more leechers, whichever comes first. I pm'ed the original seeder also, so he/she might be willing to help us out here..."
,Slaskpost-asdf,2006-08-07T09:37Z,"There doesn't seem to be any seeds here. :(

However, it was just uploaded on Demonoid if anyone is interested. I know advertisement is not popular, but since there is no seeds I believe that you would be interested."
,konelli,2006-08-07T17:04Z,"I am seeding right now, but don't see any takers although this overview indicates that there are 66 leechers. I am using Transmission on Mac OS X, it says that I am seeding, the info window indicates that 177.5 MB have been uploaded already, but the current upload indicator stays at 0 (zero). How can this be with 66 leechers?"
,Lookingglass,2006-09-04T22:37Z,This .sitx file seems to be corrupted.
,adarkmethod,2008-01-24T08:03Z,is there any chance that someone could seed this? i really need it
,biseca,2009-06-05T20:54Z,"Is there any way of contacting the person who uploaded this directly? I had no problems with the .sitx, but what about a serial number for it? I have the choice of installing the registered owner version or the demonstration version. If I choose registered owner version it asks me for a serial number."
