,mac_davis,2007-02-10T05:38Z,Why can I only open this in VLC and not Quicktime or iTunes?
,freakindawg,2007-05-07T19:43Z,Because nothing bites like an Apple?
,mturlock,2007-06-09T20:14Z,"Has anyone managed to play this is something other than VLC? I can't import into iTunes or copy to iPod, and Music converting programs (MusicMan and Audacity) can't convert it either"
,Mollekid,2007-06-27T19:19Z,You could use a program called AudioCommander to convert the files into mp3. Then you could probably import them into iTunes..
,wallbrian,2008-01-06T04:28Z,"I ran into the same problem of iTunes not recognizing the .aac files and they only work in VLC. But I figured out how to convert the .aac files Mp3 using VLC. 
- Select 'File' from the menu
- Select 'Wizard...' from the drop down menu
- Select 'Trancode/Save to file' on the first screen
- Select 'Select a stream' if it isn't already selected, then click on 'Choose'. The usual 'Open..' window appears; so select the .aac you want to convert
- on the Trancode screen, select 'Trancode Audio' and set the codec to your choice. MP3 worked for me
- on the Encapsulation Format screen, I left it as 'Raw'
- on the Additional Trancode options screen, click on 'Choose' to select the destination and file name (make sure to end with .mp3 for mp3s) and hit 'Save'
- After clicking on 'Finish' VLC will begin to convert the file.
This is okay for one or two files, but there are over 100 .aac files for When Will Jesus Bring The Pork Chops"

1. if you can afford an ipod you can afford to buy this shit and not worry about the format

2. learn to convert your shit into the formats you need?at least along the way you will learn something

3. not everyone on the planet has an ipod
