This is George Carlin reading his 2004 book "When Will Jesus Bring the Pork Chops."  Carlin has collected pieces of his comedy routines into this volume, as well as engaged in some rather long-winded commentary on contemporary themes.  His readings of his comic pieces are less inspired then were the live performances, but there is still a lot of funny material.
