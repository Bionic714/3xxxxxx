,FooWong,2006-08-06T19:36Z,"Please help.

I downloaded it, but i can't open the files. I tried with Cdisplay, RAR, ZIPZAG, but they said that the file is a broken archive.
All of them.
I don't think that it is possible, but what is wrong?
Thanks for any help"

,jvoulis7,2007-12-26T18:40Z,"Congratulations for the great job. However I have a problem viewing the comic.Just downloaded No 1,2,3. Unfortunately, can open only the first. About the others the program says they are damaged or cannot be opened. Have cdispaly,comical,winrar.All the same. Any ideas? Thanks in advance!"
,sneakypreacher,2008-01-20T01:47Z,"Hi niki23ee. I just wanted to congratulate you on this awesome upload of the Spawn comic series issues 1-150. These uploads you done are of the utmost quality. I""m 35 years old and haven't read any comics since I was in my teens...but for some reason, I""ve always been intrigued by this Spawn character. I seen the live action movie...which I wasn't too impressed with. However, going into it, I was aware that it was based on a comic character. And judging from other ""superhero"" type flicks, I KNEW the comic had to be 100 times BETTER. I was right. I""m up to issue #12 so far and I can't stop reading it. Spawn kicks ass! Thank you again."
,sneakypreacher,2008-01-20T01:51Z,"Also, I would like to add that I had no problems with the downloads or any problems viewing the material here or whatever else I see some of our fellow PirateBay citizens complaining about. It was, in all honesty, a perfect torrent for me. Just use Winrar to open all the files and you should have no problems whatsoever."
