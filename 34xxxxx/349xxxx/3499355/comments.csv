,altgeeky1,2006-07-25T04:07Z,"What do the file listings look like? how many files -- what size -- are these sliced mpeg, or a series of .TS files?

For THIS movie, I'd consider sacrificing TWO 9GB discs... but with only one person seeding I am afraid to start the download... :-("

,kentc,2007-07-20T12:35Z,Seed you fucking dickheads. Been seeding now for five days and I see all you goddamn lamers leeching and then getting out. I hope the fucking antipiratbyrån will tell your mothers that you download porn and are jacking of your little hairless ridiculous wee-wee. Fuckers. Go away.
