I┬┤m reseeding this terrific show once more.

In april 1964 PJ Proby was introduced by Paul MacCartney in the "Around the
 
Beatles"-show. 

Proby sang three songs, Rufus Thomas┬┤"Walking the Dog", "Cumberland Gap" and Elvis 

Presley┬┤s "I believe". 

Many of Proby┬┤s fans today say that "I believe" is his best song ever - judge for

your selves!
