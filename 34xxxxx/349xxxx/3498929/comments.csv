[T],Knaster,2006-06-28T07:51Z,This is perhaps the best war movie ever created.
,Ola435345345,2007-09-04T23:20Z,"In the beginning the speaker tells us that the war was going Hitlers way untill 6:th of June 1944, that D-day changed all of that. 

I become sad when I hear such bullshit..

What about the Russian people who sacrificed a fucking generation in Stalingrad and Kursk and Stood stand soo long that their war industry could keep up and then provide the germans first defeat. Hitler abandoned the army in ""Der Kessel"" and through his madness hoped for victory somewhere else. . Its a typical american disney and Spielberg storytelling that everything happened on Omaha, Gold, Juno and Sword.. 

Read Anthony BeavorÂ´s books Stalingrad and Berlin btw.. I saw them as audiobooks here on tpb."

,Pokoj,2011-01-25T17:34Z,Ola435345345 -- North African Campaign finished a year before Nomandy and it definitely didn't go Hitler's way.
