respect Swebbe!"
,Swebbe,2006-06-27T07:58Z,"Thanks :)

It is a good band, one of the best gothic bands if you ask me.... everyone should give this them a try, support them by buying one or more of their cds or just visit a concert but i'm not sure they do tours anymoer :/

oh well enjoy"

Many thanks

,lrz,2007-08-19T22:24Z,"I deeply thank you for this torrent! And thanks too to the one, who seeded this! I became nearly desperate with it, before you saved my week.

There was some important music missing, but not anymore.

May the Stone Gods follow you on your path!
