Well i was surfing around on the internet a day trying to find all Fields of the Nephilim albums as a torrent file.
But then i realised that there were none so i dedicated 2 days in order to find all albums on DC and sort
them by names and typing in info on each file useing this site:  
http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&searchlink=NEPHILIM&sql=11:jz6gtr39klmx~T20
This torrent includes all main albums and one compilation (Revelations).
I've got 1mbit upload and will be seeding day and night as long as i can.
