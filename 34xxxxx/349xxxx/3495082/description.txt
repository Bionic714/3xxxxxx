In 1999 in a storage shed off Waterman Ave in San Bernardino, CA, three friends from high school spent about six months as Dunamis Tribe composing these songs, which were recorded in 2002. The title of the work is "The Origin". Dunamis shortly thereafter dis-banded when the mountain fires spread under the lunar eclipse.
The music is instrumental and somewhat experimental, and owing to the youth of the group at that time (we were 18 when we were writing these songs) there may be recognized at times the un-subtle influences of popular genres. At their best, the songs hint at the un-recognized potential of Dunamis. 
The musicians were myself, M. Epri (The Son of Iapetus); Makasa; and Antonio, whom is now working with Stereopast (http://www.myspace.com/stereopast). 
  

The track listing is as follows:

track 1: Sunrise
track 2: The Origin
track 3: 3
track 4: Naked Gypsies
track 5: Searching (Pompous Matty)
track 6: 8
track 7: April Showers
track 8: Eclectic Doorway
track 9: Segue (Japsican Flowers)
track 10: Interlogue
track 11: Sunset

Track 10 might be a little jumpy at places as this was ripped from one of the last remaining copies of this work. Otherwise, should be fine. Enjoy!
