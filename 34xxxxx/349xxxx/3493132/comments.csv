,Sterkenburg,2006-08-08T22:59Z,"THIS TORRENT WORKED FINE FOR ME...

But the menu didn't, so I had to take the two folders, ""game1"" and ""game2"" and remove them from the Map Pack and Multiplayer folder.  Then I used them as if they were two seperate games.  The additional content that comes with the Map Pack Disc has been removed, evidently, as even 1.81GB is big, and they needed to be removed."
,unrar,2006-08-11T19:11Z,"for those that can't get this to work...
is this torrent already in iso form? if not download a prog called c-xbox tool. from there you can create a valid xbox iso image. or you could always just put the files on the hdd under the games folder."
,Tomgh,2006-08-16T13:14Z,"Hey Sterkenburg,
can you tell me what you did exactly, to make the folders like two separate games.
if you can mail me at tomummyAhotmail, I'd be very happy. 
(or if someone else can tell me, please mail)"
,vodkaeye,2006-08-16T15:29Z,"extract the iso with simplexiso craxtion 4 or qwix u will get 2 folders called game 1 and game 2. Then just create iso for each folder 
game1=multiplayer
game2=map pack"
,Twinbird24,2006-08-28T18:44Z,"If you can't get Xbox Live or don't want to or something (though you can get Xbox Live with a SOFT MODDED XBOX) you can go to one of the two websites below:

http://www.xbconnect.com/

or

http://www.teamxlink.co.uk/"
,Bolbey,2006-11-05T16:33Z,So what is this whole game file for anyway? Can you get some maps to halo 2 from it?
,Bolbey,2007-02-03T20:08Z,The menu doesnt work. I cant select option to install maps. I somehow managed to install 2 maps but thats it
