,Barl3000,2007-10-19T18:09Z,"I have heard good things about this show, when i get it I will try to seed for as long as possible."
,jdrake_2,2007-11-16T05:49Z,"Great offering.  However, the episodes are out of order.  "
,Oni_Ash,2008-11-19T15:14Z,"This is a Space TV (Canadian) Rebroadcast @ PG rating.
It's been the only live version out there for awhile, so I don't mind to keep seeding, but be warned that all violent scenes seem to have been edited, so you may be disappointed.
a lot
Not the show I remember at least..."
,overvoltage,2009-05-03T09:10Z,"jdrake_2:  I got curious when I read your comment.  Apparently they are in order of production, not air date.  The file names are from the original sources which I compiled.  See this site for air date, production order, and additional info: http://www.brimstone.us/
For the real die hard fans there is info at this site http://www.johnglover.info/brimstone/unfilmed.html about episodes that never made  it into production.
Oni_Ash: I first saw this show on SciFi in 2000 and the show always stuck in my mind.  I was delighted to find some of the episodes online but it took awhile to complete the collection.  It'd been so long since I'd seen them on SciFi that I don't recall any differences.  There has been hints it might be released on DVD.  If so, hopefully it will be uncut.
Kinda cool to see that a torrent I posted three years ago is still out there.  Post a comment if there is any interest in the same files converted to an Ipod friendly mp4 format."
,graveley,2009-06-20T07:04Z,"i remember when this series came out.it was fantastic. sadly it was in the same time slot as a new series called the X-Files, and had serious competion. had it been on at a different time it would have kicked ass. great storyline and john glover was great as the devil."
,dp812,2009-09-21T08:51Z,It wasn't in the same time slot as X-Files. Both Brimstone and X-Files were on Fox and X-Files had actually been out before Brimstone. Brimstone either preceded or followed X-Files on Friday nights.
,dzangomak,2010-11-21T00:39Z,"Been trying to find this show on a good torrent for a few years now. Good that it's still alive. Thanks, great show."
,DjDarkus,2012-04-12T02:08Z,Wow.. I honestly thought I was the only human being to watch this show! I have tried to explain it to my friends and family a million times.. I recall having to watch it at 3am in the UK.. Nothing wrong with abit of Fire n Brimstone.. Thanx muchly! :Dark x
,ScottyD7421,2012-08-19T16:40Z,"WOW!! Can't believe this is actually on here.

I saw an episode of this about 10+ years ago and it kinda stuck with me. Been looking to buy on dvd ever since but couldn't find it (who else kept running into Brimstone and Treacle while trying to find this :-))

Much obliged for uploading friend.

Cheers"
