tried launch the .exe file, an error message saying ""Fatal Error: file 'ReflexiveArcade/Background.jpg' missing!""

Yes, I did try putting all the files in a folder called ReflexiveArcade, and no, that background.jpg file isn't missing, its actually there.

Does it have something to do with the keygen? I'm not sure how to generate a password. Tried the product ID I got from a site (11620117) but it did not work. can you at least give me a valid product ID and password? Your help is most appreciated."
