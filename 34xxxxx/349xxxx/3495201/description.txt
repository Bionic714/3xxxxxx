The Sun Ra Arkestra performed live at La Sala Rosa on 2006-06-06 as part of the  2006 Montreal Suoni Per Il Popolo free-jazz festival.

    This 14-piece Arkestra is led by alto saxophonist Marshall Allen,
    who just turned 82 and joined the band 1958. Marshall also plays
    flute and the electronic valve instrument (EVI).

    Lineup includes saxophonists Charles Davis (who joined in 1955),
    Noel Scott, Rey Scott and Yahya Abdul-Majid, trumpeters Michael
    Ray and Fred Adams, trombonists Tyrone Hill and Gene Davis,
    guitarist D. Hotep, bass Juini Booth, drummer Luquman Ali and
    percussionists Art Jenkins and Elson Nascimento. 

    Sun Ra left this planet in 1993 handing the keys to the Arkestra
    to John Gilmore who in turn passed them on to Marshall Allen, an
    admirable space captain if there ever was one.

This is my corrected version of the free simulcast download MP3 available on CKUT.ca; I have cut the hour-long segments into just the two sets and removed the many annoying stream-delay drop-outs.  Both files are 128kbps
MP3 files, just like the original copies; this may not be optimum but it
is still better than the 64k mono stream that was put out over the net that night.

This is my first ever uploaded torrent; I hope I got it right ...
