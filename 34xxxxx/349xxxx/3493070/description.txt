"Not easy, but worth watching
	
This is an almost unforgettable film, one for the crazy arty section of your collection, and one that probably won't appeal to all tastes - but it is worth seeing. Remarkable plot, characters and location. For me the most memorable thing is probably the cinematography - England's Lancashire plain is a bizarrely beautiful place of emptiness, and well known for being almost impossible to photograph.

Only misses out on five stars for being Difficult. File somewhere near Peter Greenaway and My Own Private Idaho."

And......Amanda Plummer - worth all five stars alone.
