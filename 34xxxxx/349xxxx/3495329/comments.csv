Tank Abbott Vs. Yoji Anjo"
,fixed92,2006-06-14T10:51Z,i figured i mention that the Kazushi Sakuraba Vs. Marcus Silviera fight happens twice. the first time big john messes up and the second fight has a solid ending. 
,daqck,2006-06-14T12:34Z,"thanx for this fixed92, will be getting this.

i will be uploading more UFC's but because i can't upload more than 30KBs. mind i'm not connctable which is why when i downloading i'm not getting a better upload rate (something like 13ppl out of 400ppl in some case's) and there stuff i want here aswell. i keep hearing it's easy to get connectable, but its only easy when you know how.

anywy thanx again for this"

,Torrential.Reign,2011-10-30T17:08Z,"----[Option 01] Visit this bt search site:

[-] sorry but TPB won't allow full link to be posted ;
[-] It starts with bt&thenjunkie&endswithdotorg ;
[-] Torrent name is ""UFC"" ;"
,Torrential.Reign,2011-10-30T17:25Z,"[-] It's 1 of those mega-upload torrents containing UFC 01 to UFC 84 ;

[-] I do NOT recommend trying to D/L the lot ;

[-] Instead, seek out the ""bifties"" ufc torrents to get 5 events at a time; you'll have much better success; that's my opinion; do as u please ;

[-] Open torrent file in your bt S/W & select only those ufc events u want to D/L (scroll down to the bottom for the Ult Ult files) ;

[-] Begin D/L; be patient (the world doesn't owe u anything); seed was not that strong during my D/L  about 1 month ago & may be even weaker now?; took approx. 5 days to get what i needed; bear in mind that you're trying to get from seeders only 4 out of the 88 events incl. in this mega torrent ;

[-] If seed dies / weakens I suppose u can try making some noise / requests in any forums u think worthwhile the effort... u never know someone might help out...

[-] Oh yeah, scan your PC for malware after goingto the bt&thenjunkie&endswithdotorg page & similar sites; I could have sworn i picked up ""Win32:Malware-gen"" infection from there BUT can't be 100% sure."

Apologies for this convoluted method of sharing. Obviously I have the files BUT... if I try to up them then u guys will be waiting for time & all eternity to get them!
My U/L speed is limited to only 100KB/sec for P2P traffic by my ISP (as is the case with many ISPs where I live). Maybe some of u UFC freaks who've got better connect speed could do the honours after your D/L is complete... ...

Simplified Tips:
(1) Just goto the bt&thenjunkie&endswithdotorg search site & copy & paste this into the search box ---> ""koenig ufc ultimate 1995"" "
,Torrential.Reign,2011-10-31T00:13Z,"Simplified Tips:

,Torrential.Reign,2011-10-31T10:32Z,"(2) List of 4 search results appears, of which the 1st two are still alive & well (their seed/leech count is not so accurate, so don't worry).

(3) Get either the ""UFC""  or  ""UFC PPV"" torrent - both contain the 4 ultimate ultimate ufc events ('95, '96, Japan, Brazil).

(4) IMO, focus on getting those 4 rare events 1st & don't worry about the rest; 
u can always try getting other UFCs later, after u got what u came for;
so be sure to select only the ult. ult. events for downloading.

(5) If u left out step (4) then for uTorrent users, click on the ""Files"" tab; select every single file from top to bottom (* except the Ult. Ult. events at the bottom *); right-click on any of those selected files & from the pop-up menu that appears select ""Don't Download""

(6) Hopefully you'll connect to some peers who aren't too tight-arsed with their U/L sharing & have those files soon enough.

Hope this helps...
