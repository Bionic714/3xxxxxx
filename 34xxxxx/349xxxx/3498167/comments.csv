I registered just leave this comment.
Thank you from the bottom of my heart.

BTO II was the first and only BTO album I owned and I loved every song on it.  
I am sitting here listening to my childhood. 

It's 1973, I'm 15, playing this album endlessly on my little phonograph, pouring over the album cover. 
It may not be the best album they ever produced, or has all their ""greatest hits"", but it's my BTO memory. 

Big love from San Francisco."
