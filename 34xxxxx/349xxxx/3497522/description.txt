         PLOT:                                                    
         The "Ninn Worx" fashion takes on a completely different 
         turn this time around as "The" Innocence director Halle 
         Vanderhyden takes on Eva Angelina. Michael's directive   
         (to those on the set) was to "focus on Eva" and so we   
         just tried to hang on as Eva went through her paces.It's 
         beautiful; it's interesting, and it's sexual.It's also   
         interesting to see how others interpret Michale's vision.
         Sometimes you can learn a lot by just by watching.       
         (Quiet is your friend.) Oh, and Eva is in fact really,   
         really pretty, however.
