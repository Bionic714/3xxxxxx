,ruva,2006-06-29T08:11Z,Pinnacle Showcenter 200 can play this movie and it's not 1080i - it's 1080p!!! :)
,dannymc,2006-06-30T11:12Z,"do a search for nvidia`s purevideo decoder, takes most of the load off CPU and uses the graphics card`s GPU to do most of work, then use zplayer for playback, works well with purevideo, VLC will play them, without purevideo but will use your CPU for decoding with up to 90% CPU usage at times, purevideo with hardware accelaration uses upto 15%,
DATA PIRAT i use a 6600 and it worked reasonably well, didnt like 1920x1080 with stuttering and jerky playback, 720P worked great, i now use a Pixelmagic Mediabox, works flawlessly at 1920x1080P via HDMI approx £290

,kermit the frog,2006-07-01T20:59Z,Can this be burned to a normal DL DVD and then played in my Pioneer-player or is this only for use from the computer to a big screen?
,dannymc,2006-07-02T13:10Z,"it can be burnt to a dual layer but will not playback on any DVD player, they are usually recorded from HDTV broadcasts and stored on PVR hard drives or Digital VHS or PC`s with HDTV tuners in them and played back on these devices but thankfully can be ripped from same to be played back on a good PC or from something like the above mentioned Mediabox which for the money is very, very good outputting various resolutions via various outs, HDMI included, to suit your display type"
