  Description :

Weighing in at three discs and 82 tracks, Lords of Oi! is a more than generous overview of the energetic punk subgenre known as Oi! -- sometimes intelligent, sometimes decidedly not, usually musically crude, and always working-class in outlook. At three discs, of course, this is not designed for the casual Oi! fan, but nearly every band from the genre's formative... More years is here, including Sham 69, the Exploited, the Angelic Upstarts, the Gonads, the Cockney Rejects, Accident, the 4-Skins, Blitz, Splodgenessabounds, Infa Riot, Slaughter and the Dogs, the Blood, Menace, Cock Sparrer, and many more.
