,ch33tah,2006-06-24T19:53Z,"Thanks man, cool up!

Though im missing Jerry Reed - Eastbound and Down :D"
,extrudedplasticdingus,2006-06-24T20:16Z,"That would've been great on this record, but it probably came out way after all of these songs.

This is an interesting one.  You can hear a lot of Johnny Cash and Bob Dylan influence in some of the music..

Anyway, I dl'd Eastbound and Down off Limewire once."
,ch33tah,2006-06-25T13:52Z,"I think Eastbound is from 1977 i wonder when this is from.

Btw i got a little inspired by this post and searched some with Frostwire (like Limewire) and found some trucking stuff."
