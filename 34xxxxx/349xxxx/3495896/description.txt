Here it is, a reseed on Eddie Izzard's 7 shows he has recorded (so far):



- Live at the Ambassador's         1h 24min
- Unrepeatable                     1h 11min
- Glorious                         1h 40min
- Definite Article                 1h 50min
- Dress To Kill                    1h 54min
- Circle                           1h 21min
- Sexie                            1h 36min

All are in good quality, even if "Live at the Ambassador's" has an irritating sound in the background sometimes, but it's neglectable. Also, in the end of "Circle", there's some buckfutting with the sound/video, but fully watchable with some patience.
