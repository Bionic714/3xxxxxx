i ran the GetRegKey.bat
but i got three error messages saying the keys could not be exported
---perhaps this is because the xp version i ran the batch on is not a corporate edition??--

anyway, the nfo says that 'instructions included' on how to edit the two keys that must be 'edited'

i can't find these instructions...how do you 'edit' the keys??"
