,ripper_gonzales,2006-06-11T22:42Z,arnold1965: you forgot to mention that you'll have to pay money at your posted website. PB is free and that's worth a lot more than your piss site. Why don't you just crawl up your own rectum and disappear.

,Gr8flDdFn,2006-07-02T22:22Z,n/m just saw the codec thing derrrr
,awjvail,2006-07-07T04:03Z,"Very nice. Great quality and great sound. Would have been nice if there was the original dvd menu, but you can't have it all can you :)

In case anybody is looking, here is the codec required for sound.

Just download the first download link, run the EXE file, and then play the movie file in Windows Media Player :)"

I don't need install any codecs because
VLC includes them all
