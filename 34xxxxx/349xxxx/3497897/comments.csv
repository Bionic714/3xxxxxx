,Nightblade88,2010-11-17T00:44Z,"Hey buddy. Yeah you. Fuck you man.
Fuck you up the ass.
And while you're busy with that why don't you lube up with the TR/Dropper.Gen trojan laced into your torrent.

And as for the rest of you fools, don't you even check a torrent's integrity before you give your oh so informed opinions? Laughable really.

Have a nice day."
,sev_on_tpb,2011-08-16T03:21Z,"I have no idea what Nightblade88 is talking about.

As far as this rip or the mkv version, the quality difference seems negligible. (The mkv is H.264, 720 x 384, 25 fps, 793 kbps, with MPEG Layer-3 24kHz audio)"
