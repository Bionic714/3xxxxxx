,Special_One,2006-04-01T19:02Z,I'm sure this can work also with Nero StartSmart but VLC should do just fine. Tnx for upload jozty
,clq,2006-04-02T13:13Z,The uncut version of the movie is what will be in europeian cinemas.
,Bjorkved,2006-04-02T13:25Z,"Tack jozty_NL!!! Funkade perfekt för mig! Öppnade alla filmer med Media Player Classic v6.4.9.0 och hade inga problem alls! :)

Tacksam för svar"
,Electric Larry,2006-05-21T00:18Z,"I give up.  I've tried to download this fucker a thousand times.  I've tried Quick Time, and VLC, and the c**t just will not friggin play.  Do I have to use VLC in confluence with Mediaplayer Classic?  I've only got the ordinary (unless that is classic).  "

,LivaB,2009-06-13T00:11Z,"I was wondering - where do these scenes come from? I mean, where did you get it? Is the uncut movie available somewhere? Because without these fabulous sexy scenes the whole movie just loses its sense."
