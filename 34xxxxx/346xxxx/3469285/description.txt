Ayaka's 4th Idol DVD, "Moon Doll." This DVD was limited and hard to obtain outside Japan.

This was beautifully shot on location in Australia. This DVD is a mix of cute, sexy, and sensual. Those who had bad impressions of seeing Ayaka semi-nude on the cover of Moon Doll's Photobook will be surprised to find out that this DVD is actually quite enjoyable and not in the dirty sense. Ayaka seems to be a natural as a model here and I'd go as far as to say that this may as well be her best Idol DVD yet. Sure, there are some shots of Ayaka showing more skin than usual but it was done in a way that left a lot to your own imagination.

Ayaka did something really special for this DVD. She sang a song completely in English and it was used in one of the early sequences. At first listen, you might not believe it's her singing that well pronounced English but indeed it is. Music fans of Ayaka should love it.
