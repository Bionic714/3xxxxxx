,elbow777,2006-09-04T10:35Z,"this file contains a rootkit.small,that is a back door to your pc,,,DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS FILE....F U datahead"
,Andy_Norge,2007-08-21T00:15Z,I hate poeple doing that!!
,datahead,2007-09-18T00:16Z,"actually ""elbow"" the file is misread by anti virus, its used to hook and hide the memory editors for game hacking, so it wont be detected by the games ( like alot of online games do )"
,lestatvvvvvv,2010-09-18T16:48Z,"it is typical for  hacking programs to fool anti virus programs and get misread . 
So just because it says its a virus it may or not be.
So many come on here and start bitching before they have the entire story.
That type of attitude is what will kill torrents because 1/2 stories will have people afraid to download torrents and slowly it will creep to more and more torrents  till its on each and every one of them. I have seen it growing, over the last few months its gone from maybe a few legit complaints to what I would say is 90% where , its labeled as fake or virus and a argument about it is , it isn't and so on.
we want people to seed , they have to dl the program first, yet if you scare people away things dont get downloaded so no seeders.
Many things on here that were labeled as fake played or worked fine for me , or labeled as a virus were clean.
I wonder how many of those who scream virus or fake actually red what the AV program tells them or try other players for a movie before saying its fake .
Dont get me wrong there are some bad torrents and some fake ones but in the past few months it has grown to a level where none of ot can be sorted out ."
,lestatvvvvvv,2010-09-18T16:50Z,"@hugs4all why does it worry you some do have certain files .rared to save space or to keep them grouped together.
The raring don't worry me , once I look at what the rar contains is when ill be concerned or not"
