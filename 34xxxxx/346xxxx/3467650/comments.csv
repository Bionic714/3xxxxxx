,Nargathos,2006-07-27T13:07Z,"You can aswell download this from Eve onlines homepage if there is no seeder here. The Client itself is not illegal to download. Alltho i appreciate Sullafelix to upload this, it gives more commercial for the game. And the Game is the most wonderful there is, ive been stuck with this for 3-4 month now and i have no plan to break free from it. Eve Online is the best MMO game ever to be! (and ive tryed quite a few before Eve)... "

,CraXyOW3,2007-06-24T00:08Z,"I agree to Nargathos!
This is one of the best online games in a very long time, plenty has come and gone but EVE has always been there and ive tried quite the couple of them too! Try it out and trust me when i say that the 2 weeks does not give it justice the slightest bit!"
