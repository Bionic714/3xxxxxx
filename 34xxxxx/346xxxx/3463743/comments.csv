,Lerxt,2007-08-20T07:48Z,"i used to have this program.  If you're using Sonar, 	Steinberg Cubase stuff, Pro Tools (or as I call it, ""Slow Tools"") you HAVE to try SAW.  It simply outpaces everything else that you've tried and it doesn't task your CPU much at all.  PLEASE SEED!!  If I can get this again, I promise to seed indefinitely.  SEED!"
