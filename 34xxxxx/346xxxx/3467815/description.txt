     From Allmusic.com:
     Super Furry Animals are eclectic, to say the
     least. Fusing together pop melodies,
     psychedelia, and art rock with an impish, punky
     fury, the band cover more ground on their debut
     album, Fuzzy Logic, than most indie bands do in
     their entire career. However, the album works
     better as a series of moments than as a
     collection, mainly due to their overreaching
     ambition. Each song floats by on irresistible,
     catchy vocal harmonies, while the music
     alternates between glitzy overdriven guitars and
     sighing, sweeping keyboard, guitar, and string
     backdrops. Over these lush sonic beds, lead
     vocalist Gruff sings lyrics that are either
     mystical, nonsensical, or bizarrely funny --
     none of the songs make much literal sense, but
     that doesn't quite matter when the music is as
     free-spirited as this. The songs may start
     conventionally, but they'll be undercut by wild
     synthesizers and careening guitar solos, or
     off-kilter vocal melodies. Taken as individual
     moments -- as the singles "God! Show Me Magic"
     (relatively straight-ahead punk-pop), "Hometown
     Unicorn" (gorgeous psychedelia), and "Something
     4 the Weekend" (which finds the middle ground
     between the first two singles) prove -- the
     music of Super Furry Animals is quite
     intoxicating, but when assembled together, they
     don't sustain momentum. However, the individual
     pleasures of each song become more apparent with
     each listen and Fuzzy Logic suggests that the
     group could blossom into something quite
     distinctive and utterly unique within a few
     albums.
