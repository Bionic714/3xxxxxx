,dg3,2010-03-04T11:24Z,"Hey, its me DG3 the upper!
Can you believe I upped this nearly 4 years ago.
I had my stuff stolen and lost all my music. 

I have noticed no seeds on this over the last few years and was dismayed because I had brought this cd. Then a few weeks ago, holy shit a seeder!
Great stuff!  TPB, my personal file server! 

My rule is to seed to there is at least 10 other seeds no matter what.
So please everybody a minimum ratio 1:1  if under 10 seeders!  

Look after our community! Also use ""ProxyTunnel"" with ""Proxifyier"" and ""Always Up"" if youre getting hit with takedown notices! 

So remember dont have a nice Download then just FLAC OFF! Share the happiness! & joy! And Buy a CD of the artists that also give you that happiness. 
Over and out."
