,indierockerseattle,2006-04-03T00:47Z,"dood the game is $10 now, stop being a cheap ass and go buy the damn game. It not a game that should be pirated causes it to damn good."
,Me-LoDon,2006-04-03T06:50Z,no mods if you buy it
,indierockerseattle,2006-04-04T01:32Z,"what are you talking about no mods if you buy it, then how do you get mods for downloading it?


its the same thing, rather you download it and put it on your hard drive, or you buy it and put it on your hard drive. 

and this game is top-notch, worth your money, so just go buy it."
,nikoltjev,2006-04-04T12:25Z,"I agree that this is worth a buy. I bought it for the PC but downloaded the game all the same for the xbox. :) Anyway, Oblivion is the way to go now!"
,dyrtyrice,2006-04-22T10:16Z,"dyrtyrice here:)

(This is MaXiMiUS, and by the way, it should be Abandoned Flat 2.1f, I don't think there was _ever_ a 1.0f version..)"

,Dolker,2009-06-12T19:33Z,"Some people dont have an xbox or xbox 360 and want to play the game. these let us play them with the elumators that oyu can get anywhere for free. why pay the money when you can get it for free. there are only a few games for the xbox that i enjoy playing. this is one of them. im not going to buy an xbox just to play it. its a wast of time. thanks rooten, btw would you mind seeding?"
