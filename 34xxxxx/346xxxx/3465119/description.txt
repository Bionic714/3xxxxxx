***XBOX - Morrowind GOTY Ultimate Mod Library v2.0***
----------------------------------------------------

Here were are again fellow outlanders !

 I decided to release version 2.0 now because work is still continuing on Xbox 
Morrowind Mods and some of them are great, sad to see v1.0 wasnt seeded for very long at all :( , 
lets hope there's more seeds this time so everyone can enjoy these mods.


**** Whats New ****

Basically, a whole heap of stuff, the big news is 30 NEW CLASSES INCLUDING NINJA  !!
! with new ninja and ranger weapons (youll need to install Dyrtyrices Perfect Morrowind Mod Pack 2 to get these features)


A new opening titles tune, Zoops book (a very very useful book,at a price), more weapons, more armour, a new quest, 
the assassins armoury, and loadssss of other stuff, you have no idea how great some of these mods are till you give them a
go So do it ! most of the new stuff come courtesy of Dyrtyrice, who has spent a good year testing mods etc to  
make the game even better for everyone.


***********************Noob Installation*****************************

Make sure you replace default.xbe and morrowind.xbe with Frezzno's 
hacked versions, or your mods wont run.

Open The Data file inside Morrowind on you Xbox or Pc
(eg, f:/Games/Morrowind/Data Files)

Drop the esm file of the mod u want into Data files and your done !

If you have 3 folders with the mod (Textures, Meshes and Icons)
then stick them in data file as well, if youve already got these three other folders in 
there from previous mods, then just add the stuff out of your latest mod folders into those, its that easy.

Do's
 
   Always read the readme's (But ignore the pc bits) some mods may not run with others,
   or require another mod running concurrently. Two mods so far (ultimate galleon and the latest greatest housing mod gold) 
   may stop certain parts of the games script from appearing so you can't continue the main story. 
   This is rare but the Galleon is great for when you have completed the main Quest.THIS IS USUALLY KNOWN AS THE SCRIPTS BUG

   ALways clear your cache and x,y,z drives when installing a new mod

Dont's

   Try to run too many mods at once (Your Xbox only has limited memory remember)
   Getting giddy with too many mods, especially places to visit, will result in your humble box running out of
   memory and the game crashing, a lot of time has been spent by others to reduce texture size
   thus lowering memory usage but its not really known how many mods you can run safetly, and you can always remove any if 
   you get problems, just delete the .esm

Frezzno, BadBoy_AC, Dyrtyrice, ChaosTony, Johnny-Evil, Bethesda for making great games, and of course, the original mod 
creators



\Acknowledgements///////

All the hard work on these things was done by the original creators then 
many hours have been spent by Johnny-Evil, BadBoy_AC, Frezzno, Dyrtyrice and others resizing 
textures etc so you could enjoy these mods on your xbox. Without them, Morrowind would be a far duller place.

All original Readme's are included.

Most of the stuff is from ;

Frezznos Beginners pack, 
Frezznos Mod Pack Pack 2 and 3  
BadBoy_ACs Weapons Armour packs 1 and 2
Johnny-Evils site
Dyrtyrice's Morrowind Game of the Year Perfect Edition Mod Packs 1 & 2

and a few other Ive discovered along the way
