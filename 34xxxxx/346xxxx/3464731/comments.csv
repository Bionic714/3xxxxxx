,mackenneth,2006-07-23T19:09Z,"Is there anybody that has the real part 7 of War and Remembrance??? The part 7 downloaded from here is in reality part 8. And part 8 is in reality part 9 and so on. 7 is so to speak the ""missing link""...!!

I guess I'm not the only one to experience this dilemma."
,JohnnyWithmoore,2006-11-24T13:11Z,"Well if you look at Part 4 , you will find that one include ""part 5 and 6"".

Part 5 include only the last ""part 7"" Part 6 is only the Bonus.

They are all there !
