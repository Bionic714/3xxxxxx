,LeeeLeee,2008-11-05T13:10Z,"I'll be seeding this to 1:1, then hope someone else can take over as I need to make room. I think even though people sometimes tend to seed just a proportion of what they leech, these torrents need as much help as they can get!"
,LeeeLeee,2008-11-05T13:11Z,"So please everyone, seed as much as you take."
