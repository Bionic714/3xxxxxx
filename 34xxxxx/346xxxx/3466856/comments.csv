,spajjk,2006-04-05T15:53Z,guys its UMD! its a PSP version on the episode.
,hugotorvald,2006-04-05T16:13Z,"I was suspicious of the UMD-thing as well, but it is an avi-file and when I watched it it was good quality and all. And I downloaded this from DC++ since I couldn't find any torrents, and I thought that I could up it for everybody else!"
,hugotorvald,2006-04-05T16:17Z,And now I realized that UMD is simply the group that released it... and as for ep 16 you could probably find it at tvtorrent.info
,zLX,2006-04-05T17:46Z,How come I can't find any other Scrubs S05E17 torrents?

,Timmeh7,2006-04-06T03:45Z,"Oh no, 120mb more than the usual release that you're getting for free anyway, bet that's going to cost you about $0.02.  My heart bleeds for you.  Cheap bastard."
,Eddan_,2006-04-06T08:38Z,You guys should be grateful and not hate on the dude. I mean no one even released the s05e16.
,burnboy,2006-04-06T14:30Z,"S05E16 is avail here http://thepiratebay.org/details.php?id=3467111 

I don't see S05E17 non-UMD yet anywhere."
