On December 9, 1965, hundreds of witnesses saw an object crash in the woods near 
the small Pennsylvania town of Kecksburg. The official government report said the object was simply a meteorite. But eyewitnesses to the event disagree. Some say they saw the object change direction and emit a vapor trail before crashing. Others claim to have seen the object up close. They describe it as a copper-colored, acorn-shaped object 
with strange writing on it. Whatever crashed in Kecksburg, it quickly drew the attention of the U.S. military. They reportedly recovered the object, loaded it onto a flatbed truck and took it to Wright Patterson Air Force Base. What was it that caused the military to respond so quickly? What do they know that we don?t? TV Hour ? 45 minutes
