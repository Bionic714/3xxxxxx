Story: 
In the heart of Seoul, Korea, a band of killers-for-hire is slowly making a name for themselves in the business. Their style--kill the victims the way their clients want them to be killed, no questions asked. For this group to succeed, they need the help of each other--and an uncle who designs super cool gadgets in the privacy of his own home. However, the foursome will need more than manpower and an uncle to carry out a new mission they just accepted. Along with an intelligent detective hot on their trail, the killers must accomplish "the perfect crime" or face the consequences. Will their mischievous ways be too much of a burden or will they pull out the crime of the century?
