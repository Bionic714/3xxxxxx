,McPorra,2006-04-06T01:02Z,PopArt... this is GOLD!!! THX Buddy!
,Bob_T,2006-04-06T01:27Z,Thanks PopArt.
,PopArt,2006-04-06T02:22Z,"@Moto736: you should ask M@rtijn. I am not doing anything, but I would love the Ariane 737 series ;-)"
,experimental_pilot,2006-04-06T03:43Z,I assume your uploading this because its a more recent version than the previous torrent?
,Bob_T,2006-04-06T03:47Z,"It has the SP1 update with a cracked gauge. Which afaik, hasn't been uploaded yet."
,Bob_T,2006-04-06T04:12Z,Is the cracked gauge not working for anyone else?
,McPorra,2006-04-06T04:28Z,100% working
,Bob_T,2006-04-06T05:09Z,"Hmm...

Wonder why my computer doesn't like it. I'm having the issue of the autopilot gauges not showing up. I had this problem with the first upload, but two reinstalls fixed it. I've reinstalled this one five times now and it's not working. Guess I'll just have to keep with it.

Anyone have any ideas? And yes, I'm following the directions. ;)"
,PopArt,2006-04-06T05:29Z,@Bob_T: I just double checked the autopilot and it is functional on my pc. I really don't know why it isn't working on yours :-(
,Bob_T,2006-04-06T06:04Z,"Thanks for checking.

I can't figure it out. :( I'm almost ready to reinstall FS9 and my addons to see if that might help."
,Bob_T,2006-04-06T06:56Z,"Well, finally got it to work. :) Don't know what the problem was the first seven or so times I tried. Oh well, it works now and that's all that matters.

Thanks for the upload PopArt. I'll be seeding. :D

On another note. Did anyone else notice a major jump in performance? The first version ran like crap on my computer; took forever to load, and VERY bad frames. All that is gone with the update."
,luke97,2006-04-06T12:02Z,"Im sure its my pc problem, but I get a problem of firewall everytime I use the de-wrapper with this puppy. The funny thing is that I dont have a FW!
I´ll try it on my other PC.

Tnx Pops!"
,PopArt,2006-04-06T12:17Z,"No FireWall? (scratching head)

Eeeks, you're really a dare-devil ;-)"
,Mr Silver,2006-04-06T12:22Z,"Thanks PA, you gotta be the dogs dangly parts...!"
,McPorra,2006-04-06T12:45Z,"Just in case anybody has difficulty trying to install with loader v3.7, use loader v3.5 instead.  That's the only one that worked for me. "
,PopArt,2006-04-06T13:23Z,@Bob_T: sometimes I don't understand why it needs a Service Pack to get the FPS just right. Can't they do that the first time? Saves us pirates a lot of work ;-)
,whityini,2006-04-06T15:53Z,No fonts?
,HighFlyer,2006-04-06T16:10Z,"Thanks a lot PopArt! ;)

FeelThere Caravan anyone? I know it's old, but I'd still like it. "
,whupp,2006-04-06T16:44Z,"@virgin747

'total commander' from h**p://www.ghisler.com/

:)"
,experimental_pilot,2006-04-06T17:29Z,"BobT, Im having the same problem with the A/P.
How did you fix it?  Just Uninstall and Reinstall?"
,virgin747,2006-04-06T17:35Z,"whupp, thats it, new it was commander but couldnt remember. Thanks a million.
Pete"
,Nitrox_Diver,2006-04-06T18:24Z,"Works like a charm, like always!
Thanx!"
,experimental_pilot,2006-04-06T19:50Z,I got it working now too.  Thanks
,Imiloa,2006-04-06T21:56Z,I've got the A400 but it crashes the sim everytime I try to fly it. Followed the instructions but can't get it to work. Any help would be appreciated.Maybe a dummied up version for me would work? Thanks PA for the awsome uploads!
,bushbear,2006-04-08T17:30Z,How's the GA-727-2.EXE (Flight1 727 v2) coming? Any loader higher than v.3.7 or any way to crack? 727v1 is no problem...Thanks for this MD80!!!
,McPorra,2006-04-08T17:46Z,"bushbear: If we could only put our hands in the 727v2 installer, let's say we have a good chance to get this thing to work. Imagine using de-Flight1.exe with 727v1 to generate a license without having to install it; than use the 727v2 installer (not the wrapper) to do the rest of the job. Looks simple to me... but we need someone to seed the v2 installer."
,Dj_LuG,2006-05-05T22:32Z,"I have the same problem with the Automatic Pilot and I don´t know where i can  resolve it

Sorry for my english, I´m spanish
