,dunateen,2006-04-03T07:27Z,No they are in mp3 128 i do this so they can be easily downloaded if you prefer wav its not too hard to convert them back dj dunateen
,tabasco8,2006-04-16T09:06Z,"hi dunateen,

it's nice that you are sharing loops to other producers. but; if you really like to share samples and loops that producers can use in their own work, please upload loops with at least this quality: .wav 16bit 44.1kHz. shure, you can convert into a wave again, but some (important) frequencies of the original are lost. you will never get a good quality sample again.

like this, perhaps they are good samples. but absolutly unusual for any producer...

,dunateen,2006-04-17T14:53Z,ok thanks for that info i will keep it in mind
,dunateen,2006-04-17T14:55Z,i also use a lot of mp3 samples because my new sequencer supports them and wav takes up so much hdd space
,hurriKane,2007-01-16T12:19Z,Could you please upload them in WAV format also? Thanks!
,sleepydragon,2007-06-13T13:16Z,u cant convert 128k mp3 back to wav u moose lol
,gimme5,2008-03-02T01:33Z,"actually, tabasco8 is right...
mp3 codecs cuts higher frequencies and even intermediate frequencies that they consider usually inaudible. That's why they're called Lossy codecs... It's impossible to revert to the original sample. "
,amority,2008-03-02T19:17Z,One of my results with these loops: http://thepiratebay.org/tor/4053448/Amority_-_Testing_Heaven_vol_II_[_New_Creation_Remix_]
,james.brittle,2009-03-13T13:41Z,will ableton support the mp3's?
,ChudBensonfist,2010-01-31T23:03Z,"To convert to  Wavs, open MP3 in Sound Forge and save as Wav,  sorted,  although they're going to sound flat so don'tvexpect a full sound from your tune.  "
,Surrealworld,2011-01-25T14:12Z,Thank you Mr Dunateen
