Shearing has alway been a personal favorite of mine. These are MP3's I've collected during Napster's rein as king then WINMX. Most are from Shearing's Satin album days. My personal fav is September in the Rain he recorded with his quintet live. For pure Jazz enthusiasts that has to rate among the best pure jazz numbers ever recorded. East of the Sun & I'll Remember April were also recorded that night. These numbers are pure Jazz at  it's best. To bad Sharing changed styles, guess money/record sales was the issue. Even with his style change you cannot discount his ability to play around the melody and create another melody within the song, if that makes sense. Autumn Leaves is a perfect example when he plays around the orchestra's lead. Ray Anthony plays one beautiful trumpet solo on Shadow of Your Smile
