,stans,2006-03-24T21:45Z,Just get 1st dvd. 2nd dvd is just extras. Full game is only 1 dvd. Thanks.
,Darkfield,2006-03-24T22:32Z,What about third disk? existance?! I want it bad
,mvanle,2006-03-25T09:27Z,Has anyone got this working - I'm burned this 3times using different speeds but still can't get it to work with the swap magic disc 2.0 ?
,oblachubs,2006-03-25T17:37Z,swap magic?  Get a mod chip dummy.  Not that stupid shit.  I can't believe you even posted that.
,Raziel36,2006-03-27T06:27Z,"Disc 2 is the only reason to download this release.  It's the online game.. if you look hard enough on the web and get an original game disc ID to patch with, then you can easily get past the DNAS check and play online."
,stub1982,2006-03-31T00:59Z,"How do u burn this file type to dvd, my pc doesnt recognise .001, .002 etc, etc. Why is this, it's so shit."
,ropsu,2006-03-31T16:33Z,Unpack it with Winrar.
,stub1982,2006-03-31T16:40Z,"I dont have a clue, win rar doesnt recognise it."
,stub1982,2006-03-31T16:52Z,"Got it, cheers!"
,ropsu,2006-04-03T16:26Z,"Does this work in net?
If not, how I can put it to work :D"
,krille__1986,2006-04-05T21:30Z,i have swap magic 3.6 plus and it works fine...
,krille__1986,2006-04-05T21:33Z,"all of you that don't now what to do with the .001 files.
download 7-zip or powerarchiver then it will work. i only have powerarchiver because it's the best, you dont need winrar or winzip or whatever, everyone download that now..."
