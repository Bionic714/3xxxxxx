This is for XBOX ;)

So far, the only way to get demos for 360 is by Marketplace and the XBOX magazine."

""ben666satan"" You stupid ugly bitch, changing the firmware on your Xbox 360's DVD-ROM drive and OR adding a mod chip IS essentially hacking it you dumb fuck. Look up the MANY definitions to the word ""hack"", you fuck-muffin, and you'll see what I'm saying.

The definition to the word ""HACK"" is ""To alter"". Such as the Xbox 360 you are altering the original firmware with a differnt line of code that allows the running of unsigned game disk. That my friend IS HACKING.""

Hey moron, my whole point was that you couldn't alter shit without step-by-step instructions, not even a toaster oven let alone a 360. You could spend your whole life trying to figure out how to hack a 360 without step by step instructions, but your puny little brain would never make it work. So instead of acting all proud of yourself, why don't you grow a fucking brain. "
