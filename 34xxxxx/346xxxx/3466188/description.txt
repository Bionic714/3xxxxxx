Install Notes: 

OK this is a fully working demo of the game, but they have a protection on it
that doesn't allow it to run on a modded xbox, there is a simple way around this. If you do not use these steps the screen will stay loading forever. 

1. Extract image & FTP to the xbox. (OR burn the Image to disk)

2. Now you have to go into the xbox file explorer on your xbox and choose
   the location where you saved HitmanBloodMoney E drive or F drive witch-
   ever you saved it to, now locate the hitmanbloodmoney.XBE or default.xbe file
   and click it and the game should launch and go past the loading.
           
3. PLAY!!!
   
   
Other Notes: Other Xbox games had this issue to like Mech Assault 2 and 
007 Everything or Nothing. There may be a way to patch it. 


Step 2

Another way is to burn the image and boot up the xbox with the disk in the drive.
