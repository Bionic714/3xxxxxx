,minkes,2006-03-21T15:26Z,I hope this is a scanned version of the 300+ pages official guide by Prima?
,GMVini,2006-03-22T01:07Z,"Actually this is real.
373 pages. One big PDF file."
,GMVini,2006-03-22T16:35Z,"Some small problems with the guide:
Pages 67 and 68 are added 2 times each.
Page 330 is missing completely.

Thats all I noticed to far."

I open it with quickpar and it said no need to fix ... so you guy might safely skip them when downloading .. "
