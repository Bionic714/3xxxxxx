this is a old demo tape i made with a friend back in 1991. greatly inspired by venom, bathory and others. we are not musicians however so this was made with a sampler and a beatbox (a crappy roland tr-505), the guitar samples are from some kreator album. we then delivered some unholy growling over the whole thing... i recently uncovered this great track and made a mp3 out of it. the recording is really awful, with way too much reverb and distortion, but in an atmospheric kind of way, you get the feeling you're on a rollercoaster through hell or something.
have a listen! maybe you'll like it...
cheers!
