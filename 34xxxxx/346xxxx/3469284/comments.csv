,forgetit,2006-04-12T00:09Z,"Crack works fine. But it's a terrible game. Clunky interface, bad graphics, lame repetitive levels, bad AI, the works. Superhuman enemies, they take a full magazine at point blank, or get up after a dozen headshots. Ammo enough, that's not the problem, but still weird."
