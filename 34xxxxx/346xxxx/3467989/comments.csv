Thanks !!"
,BlackBug,2006-04-08T06:43Z,"Thanx for this 737-200 from the Aerosim Collection. It was the only a/c I wanted from the entire collection. And talking of that, is it possible to upload packages (such as the aerosim collectn) with separate files (Single torrent-Multiple files). So that users can download the ones they choose. It will be a great boon for bandwidth starved ppl like me :) Keep up the good work."
