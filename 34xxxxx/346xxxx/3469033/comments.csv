Does someone can tell me if this copy of ""Can dialectics break bricks"" is the same copy of very very very poor quality of a VHS ??????????????"
,Josy,2009-03-30T21:59Z,"Thanks for the file. Unfortunately, this is obviously made out of a poor quality VHS. And the image is B&W. In my memory (I'm old enough...) this film was in (deliberately bad) color. This avi file is enough to get an idea of what the movie was, not enough to enjoy watching it from beginning to end."
