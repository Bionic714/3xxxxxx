,flukielukas,2006-03-29T04:00Z,"hey Sarre I have episode 5 - Hanging By A Thread. Will post it up soon, as soon as our ADSL 2 connection is up and running. Episode 6 - Mistaken Identity has not been screen in Australia as yet, but when it does I'll endeavour to post it up. What does everyone think of Air Crash Season 3? It's nowhere near as good as season 2 in my view, the acting and computer graphics/images aren't the same quality. Some interesting crash investigations none-the-less."
,Skysystems,2006-05-06T16:48Z,on www.flyingbytes.org there are many air crash investigation episodes
