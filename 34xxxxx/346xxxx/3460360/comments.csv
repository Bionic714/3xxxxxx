,Vampyre_Byte,2007-05-23T03:48Z,"OFFICIAL NOTICE:  Anyone who downloads this movie and whines that is not the ""NEW 2007"" movie should consider themselves officially authorized to go jump off the nearest cliff or on some other convenient way remove themselves from this planet.  Torrent posting date is March 2006.  If you didn't at least notice that you are too dumb to live."

,gwilli33,2007-06-28T19:35Z,"tretusen12 needs to go back to grammer school and learn to read. This was uploaded 21 MAR 2006. I totally agree with Vampyre_Byte, people need to learn how to read or off themself. Why can't anyone read now days?"
,yevinorion,2007-07-01T17:26Z,"Geeez...a lot of complainers here. Guys....Transformers started as a cartoon and action figure tie-in...this movie is old, and was officially called Transformers: The Movie long before anyone even thought to do a live-action/cgi version...so at least know a bit about your subject matter before telling people not to download what I think is a great animated film."
,TallusX,2007-07-05T04:15Z,Need more seed!!!
,TallusX,2007-07-05T04:21Z,"I once saw this movie along time ago,
and now i youst wona see it again..Nice that som one still got the movie..."
,Zeroes,2007-07-06T22:35Z,"one would think it obvious that since within the title of this torrent one can see the words, ""DVD - Rip"", and since the 2007 movie isn't on a DVD, conclusions should have been drawn.

good quality for the toon, you can buy this one at a pawn shop for 1.50 if you want better quality =}"
,insandare,2007-07-09T10:07Z,Wery cool film for those of us that are a bit nostalgic about the transformer series from the 80's.
,Melman33,2007-07-28T03:21Z,"ROFL av downloaded the proper 1 weeks ago from ISOHUNT.COM
