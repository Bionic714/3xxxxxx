AMG Review :
More direct and focused than Cereal Killer Soundtrack but often equally amusing,
333 finds Green Jelly continuing to parody heavy metal, thrash metal and
alternative rock with highly entertaining results. The band is still too
self-indulgent for its own good at times, but it's less of a problem than
before. Though nothing on this CD is in a class with "Three Little Pigs," tracks
like "The Bear Song" (which almost sounds like a sequel to "Pigs"), "Jerk,"
"Carnage Rules" and "Pinata Hed" showed that the rockers still weren't afraid to
have a great deal of fun. Consistently irreverent, Jelly doesn't hesitate to
parody everyone from Ministry to Guns N' Roses to the Beastie Boys.
