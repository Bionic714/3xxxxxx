,goot,2006-05-21T19:05Z,"yeah, it works, but it seems the version for xp, pcsx2.exe is missing, I just have pcsx2t.exe, the slow one.... same thing with the one downloaded from their homepage..... the game i used was god of war.... but it's damn slow, the menu is like 4 fps...."
,Half-DeadCRO,2006-05-24T09:37Z,"This Emu is f*cking sh*t, because commercial games dont work(they are somehow protected), but this is for HOME MADE games which work on PC and on PS2 - they arent protected. And GOOT, you have a problem, you havent XP installed, in which year do you live???"
