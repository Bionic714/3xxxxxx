,GeeTI,2006-03-23T18:47Z,"Thanks anyway, cipprio.

Anyone have a valid .lic file for Flight1's SSTSIM.I can install using wildmans unwrapper but FS will close without a valid licence file.

Any help much appreciated. :)"
,Mogz,2006-03-23T18:58Z,@geeti even if some does have a valid .lic for the SSTsim - concorde v2 it wouldnt work for you. the newer .lics are computer specific.
,Rexxxifon,2006-03-23T19:04Z,"cipprio, why not nuke this torrent? makes it easier to keep 1 going, rather than multiple. the Torrent from Popart and Reg fix from Maximus works great."
,GeeTI,2006-03-23T19:10Z,Cheers Mogz.........any idea how to crack this nut then?? :)
