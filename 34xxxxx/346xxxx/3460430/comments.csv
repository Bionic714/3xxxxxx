,Hogenberg,2006-03-30T00:13Z,have download this file. Extracted with winrar. now i get a .gcm. How can i open or extract it?
,StarrScream,2006-03-31T16:50Z,"Hoi Holland ;)

I'm not quite sure why you want to convert it to *.bin with winiso, if that's you intention at all. But if so, just burn the *.iso image with Nero on a dvd (normalsize or smal)... works every time for me.
If you are thinking of playing the game via a emulator then I'm of now help to you. I have never tryed playing a NGC via the PC. Try the main TPB forums for better help with the emu thing...
If I have missunderstod you then pleace say so."
,StarrScream,2006-03-31T16:55Z,"Hoi again Holland..

After unpacking the rar files you simply have to rename the *.gcm file to *.iso and rock on!!"

Har du mer än 20 gamecube titlar? Sitter du bakom BBB 24/1 eller högre?
Skicka då ett privat mess till mig. Jag har ett förslag du säkert kommer tycka är intressant."
,michaelsowa,2006-04-21T18:55Z,"Hello,

I have just stumbled across GC title on torrents and wondered if you could enlighten me.  I take it you DL these files and burn to a DVD, but where do you find the DVD's to fit the GC?"
,Macoco,2006-10-25T20:51Z,"The easiest way to get thoose small dvds is to order by internet, just keep in mind that they are 8cm instead of 12.

Another way of solving the problem is to change your gc case apperance. Which makes it possible to play regular sized dvds in it, that thing you also have to order over the internet, but then you really need to have a modded gc. If I make no sense, Im excused, cause Im a swede."
