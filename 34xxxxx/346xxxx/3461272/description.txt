Loads of music that I've downloaded and a few I own from Bjork all put into a nice compilation for you! :) There's also one track from her former band the Sugarcubes "Happy Birthday".

It's a bit of an odd situation with Bjork. Apparently you either love her or fucking hate her. I personally think she's great. Her music's great and 80% innovative in my opinion.

There's also the school of thought (by men) that she's an ugly dog. Well I refute that - you may think she looks fucking wierd (what do you expect from an eskimo) but I personally would do her. LOL - ok fun's over - i'm kidding. No i'm not - I wouldn't have a prob. Yes I would - I remember the airport incident - damn she is a bit mental on occasion........but nevertheless..........here's the music. What the fuck am I talking about........cue music.......... shit's sake.........
