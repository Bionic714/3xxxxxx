,david1,2006-03-23T12:14Z,"Well, I appreciate your comments on Bjorks looks, but how about adding a list with the songs too?  Is it just songs from the albums (which I already have)? Do I really need to download the torrent-file just to find out... yeah, I probably will. Thanks Xeno2007! Bjork is one of the most innovative and charismatic singers of modern world!!!!"
,david1,2006-03-23T21:52Z,"?? It isn't Bjork singing ""Leaving on a Jetplane"" (I think it's Jewel), she isn't doing any vocals on Paul Oakenfelds song, neither on ""Wrapped around your finger""...."
,AnastasiaScreamed,2008-11-05T21:59Z,"Hey, now that we have established who would or wouldn't DO Bjork-WOULD SOMEONE PRETTY PLEASE RE-SEED THIS! If for no other reason than just the Birthday(Sugarcubes)Track alone! Oh and by the way, If I was a Dude, I would do her too!"
