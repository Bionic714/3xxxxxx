,qazwsx123454,2006-04-06T23:12Z,Nån som har ett bra förslag på windows-skiva att ladda ner till detta? gärna på svenska. Och gärna med serienummer och mojj för att kunna köra Windows Update.
,orpheus,2006-04-08T01:39Z,"lets ppl know about bootcamp who dont look at mac sites that much.
like me :D but im still on a G4"
,1punch,2006-04-08T17:19Z,"Works!  I have both Mac OS X and Windows XP.  http://thepiratebay.org/details.php?id=3460928
Used this to download windows.  Works"
,1punch,2006-04-08T17:21Z,Also lets you put files from your Mac Os X Hard drive to your Windows Hard Drive.  Now I can use my favorite windows programs on my cool mac.
,rowdy,2006-04-15T15:16Z,Worth mentioning (for the computer illiterate) - for your INTEL mac. 
,godzil,2006-04-17T21:45Z,Of course ^^
,xxdesmus,2006-04-23T18:48Z,it's not official you douche. it's not even supported.
,scunky,2006-04-29T14:58Z,"I think the point is...
If you get into any shit don't expect any support from Apple."
,scunky,2006-04-29T15:00Z,.........I mean we all know how  Stable XP is right??
,Luigi9849,2006-04-30T09:21Z,"scunky, in the two years I have used Windows XP it has not crashed on me.

You're an idiot.

Mac sucks.

Did you hear about those boot camp users that got fucked over and they couldn't boot back into OS X? Fucking hilarious."
,scunky,2006-05-09T10:51Z,if xp is so stable how come microsoft release so many fixes..... dumb ass!
,timbobimbo,2006-05-21T05:58Z,"boot camp is not working for me when I download Windows. What do I specifically burn to the CD the iso or the files or the folder with the files, or a folder with the iso...help!!!"
,in_the_navy,2006-05-21T19:52Z,"why on Earth would you want to defile the wonderful Mac, with Windows...?

Mac and OS X rocks.

PC and Windows can burn...!"
,maverickthird,2006-06-26T13:38Z,"Sorry for the previous post. 

I see no need for Windows anymore. You can find games ( with updates and patches ) and programs that work ideal with Mac OS X. 
 I have a G5 Dual 2.7 and it never crashed like Windows used to. Especially when I work with 4-5 programs at once ( Flash, Dreamweaver, Corel, Illustrator, Quark, etc.. ). 

PS: If you really want Windows back, you can try Vitrual PC 7. "
,Martin1.97,2006-07-07T14:04Z,"I dont think that windows can burn, just because pc is so big and dominant, and just admit it, pc is still most used... but now do mac'users have both!!!!"
,4nr-,2006-08-25T09:12Z,"aged version, download newer @ http://www.apple.com/macosx/bootcamp/"

,lucazama84,2006-11-28T16:30Z,anybody knows where to find a bootable copy of the original windows xp sp2 cd that will work with boot camp assistant??
,CrazyChris2,2006-12-11T19:35Z,"Hey retards... computers are computers.


Macs crash, Windows computers crash... get fucking used to it. Get a shovel, clean out your oversized vaginas, and go get a damn education."
,kgulaalex,2008-01-09T20:10Z,"DO NOT DOWNLOAD OR INSTALL
i have succesfully installed leopard on 
Sempron64 2600 2x512 ram ati9550 256mb
IT WILL DAMAGE YOUR HARD DRIVE
IT HAPPENED TO ME. IT IS NOT A JOKE. THIS WILL CRIPPLE YOUR BOOT FILES:
""invalid partition table""
WITH LUCK YOU CAN INSTALL VISTA BUT NO XP
if you have already installed... leopard is stuck on 60hz refresh rate with no ati drivers and it is IMPOSSIBLE OT RUN WINDOWS APPS ON IT. You will get error.
.
.
.
YOU RISK PERMANENT DAMAGE TO YOUR COMPUTER WITH ANY LEOPARD INSTALLATION.
I am not a n00b and i will not touch os x again after what happened. I AM STILL UNABLE TO INSTALL XP and writing from vista

""invalid partition table"" at boot. BEWARE AND DO NOT DOWNLOAD. i had a perfect case install and still...

DOWNLOAD OR INSTALL ON YOUR OWN RISK. COMPUTER PERMANENTLY DAMAGED WITH ANY LEOPARD NOT JUST THIS ONE. it`s because of hfs.

YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.
i wrote this to prevent otherf from experiencing what i have gone through."
