,wishfish,2006-07-20T17:59Z,"The stats above show that there have been 191 downloads of this file since 27th March2006 (less than four months ago) and now ther are only 3 people still seeding it. Given that one of those is the original seed, that suggests people a committing on average a little less than a day to seeding this after downloading it (I think)."
,Lobo69,2006-08-18T17:27Z,Anyone know what codec is needed to view these files? G-spot say that there should be no problem but all my movieviewers refuses to show it.....

How do convert these using WINAVI to fit on numerous DVD's so I dont have to reduce too much of the quality

Burned plenty of movies, but usually only 700-1400MB (2.7GB when converted to DVD), so they always fit on one DVD and never had the problem.

Thanks"
,jumpinjamez,2007-06-04T23:01Z,upgraded my internet just to get this...i will keep it on as much as possible. Thanks to all the seeders you guys are legends of the net.

,ApocalypseBob,2007-06-25T08:39Z,"I don't understand why people want smaller packages. It's not rar'ed together, all seperate files, so just download the files you want?

Using Azureus, but assuming that any decent client should allow you to download only what you need.

And speaking of .rar files: Please do NOT lump whole seasons together in a single archive file. Makes it impossible to download just the episodes people need."

,gnunard,2007-07-04T08:27Z,sry atlana that it took so long to answer. If you think that more peeps would be able to get the best series in the world then go right ahead. the music from franke is really good but i have all of the albums. I will be staying with this torrent. but feel free to dice it up and reseed in season packages :)
,washmecar,2007-07-18T15:27Z,"TRIED TO DOWNLOAD THIS BEFORE, BUT IT JUST WOULDNT!, IS IT SAFE TO TRY NOW? REALLY LIKED THIS SHOW.

It allso seeds the parts of the file I've already downloaded on a partial. Right?

Åerhaps this is a stupid fucking question, but please give me an answer.

Thanks. 

Great torrent BTW. Thanks gnunard. "

Been trying some stuff to get to the contents of the mkv container, but had to give up in the end. Allthough they play fine on VLC I'd like to convert them to divX so I can play them on my dvd player. Why on earth would you or anybody else for that matter use this format??

thanks very much for the upp though, as I said, the five seasons of B5 and the crusade stuff was asome. 

thanks dude!"

My uTorrent info says Seeds 3(60).  Is that good?  My PC is usually on 24/7 so I should be able to contribute.  What is seeding?  Am I sharing bandwidth?  I bow before the greatness of you all and confess my ignorance.  Grunard, you are amazing for putting this here for all to use!!!  Let me know if there is anything more I can do."

   I've actually watched almost all of these on dvd years ago, a friend had em.. And last year watched pretty much all the B5 series, movies and crusade on tudou, and yukou, and just anywhere I could find it - tell ya, interesting task really.. Anyways, YOU ROCK!

   I've only downloaded 3 other torrents before, all games. And never seeded - I feel so bad now, had I really known what an IMPACT sharing a LITTLE BANDWIDTH came down too..
   NEEDLess to say Im looking at a battle that will last between 2 weeks and 3 years! lol. No biggy, I have a new found love for Unlimited UPload Bandwidth. And yes, I feel Im being abused, when I run on a decimal and give in on the 50's... Well, maybe others might wake up to a revelation. I know I wont

Trust me my fellow pirateBayers, DONT watch Babylon5's ""Crusade"", it is so not written and produced by the same people, it really takes away the magic of B5.

Most of the time there are only 2 or 3 seeds showing connected, with download speeds of 0 to maybe 1.5k. Today there was a very brief burst of lightning speed that went up to 4k, but that's it. Now, I'm pretty new to torrents, so maybe I'm not doing something I need to. Should I be adding more trackers, and if so, where and how do I find them for this torrent?"

Because only 96 seeders (with an average upload speed of 25Kb/s because they have old telephone modem.... oherwise they download stargate SG1 and atlantis and universe) and about 1430 leaches that dont seed at the same time what they donloaded.. that is why this download is so slow...

I guess babylon 5 lovers are greedy sons of.....

Wanted to upload everything of stargate and everything of startrek...DVD format...but hell yeah my mobile HSDPA modem of my laptop is only 358Kbit up....  and I need the bandwith to seed this fu**** B5 because (almost) no one else does. So that will take me 10 years. :)  who gives a F**** this is free and real lovers buy original anyway...

So everyone stop complaining and so what if it takes 2 years....

By the way... ETA of B5 is now 2y322d but I seed what I have (0.5%) :)  love you all"
,B.Genaaid,2010-03-07T00:07Z,"Not so bad after all, still 25 minutes to go,

little shorter than 2 years. even shorter than 2 weeks, :)

 for other Peers (leeches).... sharing for this torrent almost all your upload bandwidth (90%)  in my case 30KB/s helps speed up things. to prevent too much overhead data restrict uploadslots to a maximum of 15.

Will seed all when online, will have to shut down laptop for a while soon to let it cool of.. but... i'll be back."
,tangariatto,2010-04-01T11:58Z,"hey people im trying hard to help this torrent get back on track and i suggest some of you grow a pair and keep on seeding when you're done.

been uploading from 500 kb/s to 1mb/s during the last 3 weeks, and that makes a total of about 700 gb's of upload. so some people ARE trying

if you have the bandwidth, there's hardly anything to loose from seeding. do the right thing guys

btw americans can watch the series streamed for free, just google it"

,DustyBtmz,2010-05-13T10:35Z,"Grand Kudos Gnunard. Many Many thanks for the great collection.

To the folks whining about download speed.
This is a mega torrent. The rough equivalent of 70 average feature length files in size. 

If you aren't prepared to wait patiently for it, don't start it. If you aren't prepared to leave it in seed queue for however long it takes you to download it, times about 3-10 depending on your bandwidth asymmetry, then walk away.

Consider that the current 10:1 leach to seed ratio means each seed is spread thin. If you expect to just pop on with your bottom tier DSL and blaze through it then don't bother starting it, you'll just stop 30% into it and soak up seed bandwidth put to better use by patient people. People who are likely to seed it faithfully.

If you expect to connect and get any sort of DL at all... be prepared to upload as you go. If you can't manage that, don't bitch. If you have a crap share ratio in this torrent... nobody will care that you can't leach quickly. Try shutting down your other 15 torrents so your have some upload bandwidth and see if uploading doesn't get you a better download speed.

If you have all sorts of disposable bandwidth... good for you. Other people with tons of disposable bandwidth don't need to drop everything to get you fixed up quickly.
There are seeders out there servicing large libraries...
Just because this file is large, doesn't mean they need to drop everything else just to make you comfy.

If you're one of those folks who can't figure out how to set up their own torrent client, stick to smaller torrents till you can RTFM.

This collection is worth the wait and is in high demand.
everybody just STFU and wait... patiently.

If you don't feel like seeding, just GTFO."

,DogNo7,2010-06-14T19:02Z,"For the people having speed issues...

In most bittorrent clients, you can set individual files for higher priority.

This way, you can watch episodes that have downloaded while you are still downloading the rest.

I'm just saying...  rather than bitch, deal with it."

I recently ""got"" the Babylon 5 Complete Universe on DVD, In what order should I watch the episodes and movies? Assume I want to avoid spoilers.

Many thanks

T

***Answer***

Start off with the pilot (""The Gathering"") but dont be put off by it, its not the best but everything has to start somewhere!

Then watch all of season 1 and season 2, some people will say ""watch In the beginning before season 1"" and although the events in that film (the earth/mibari war) are before season 1, it is told from 2278 and has a lot of other stuff in it you just will not appreciate until later, not to mention some of the info on sinclair practically ruins season 1 viewing for you.

After season 2, move straight into season 3 and then from season 3 go into season 4...

midway through season 4 between the episodes of ""Into the Fire"" and ""Moments of Transition"" is the time to watch ""Thirdspace"" which is set between these 2 episodes and has no spoilers or anything as it is pretty self contained.

Then continue with season 4. After season 4 is the time to watch ""In The Beginning"" in my view as it will show stuff from season 3, before season 1 and also some season 4 things, it will also hint at the near future in season 5 and you will really enjoy this film, i believe personally it is the best of the films.

Then watch season 5 upto ""Objects at rest"" which is the one from last episode, do not watch ""sleeping in light"" just yet.

After objects at rest watch River Of Souls which is set 6 months after Objects at rest (in 2263) not bad film.

Then watch Legend of the rangers (if you want to watch it) but i wouldnt bother as its awful and not consistent with rest of B5. This is where it fits in timeline wise as it is set 3 years after objects at rest.

After LoTR its time for A Call To Arms, 2nd to in the beginning a good theatrical film introducing the new charaters of the spin off ""Crusade"". this is set 5 years after season 5.  This was kind of pilot for crusade as well as a final movie for b5. If you have the 13 eps of crusade on DVD watch these directly after ACTA, they are good and crusade would have become a great show like B5 if the network would have allowed it to run.

After a call to arms and crusade, you are ready to watch Sleeping in Light and cry with the rest of us that there is no more B5 left to watch.

In Valens Name
Steve
