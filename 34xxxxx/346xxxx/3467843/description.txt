I really enjoyed this movie and want to share it with you.  I suspect that sharing it will do more good than 'damage' to anyone ;-) so here it is.  It's an unusual and uplifting movie - how many movies have you seen that are Tibetan???

The subtitles are in English and although the plot seems deceptively simple, it isn't cheesy or simplistic and is definitely thought-provoking.  It's set in northern India, where the Tibetans have been in exile since the Chinese invaded their previously isolated country and many fled across the himalayan mountains and carried on their lives elsewhere.


From a commentary on IMBD:
==========================
Much of the Buddhist philosophy in this movie comes out once we have seen the entire picture. The characters within the film take their time in maturing. Most of the change we see within them occurs after the climax of the film. For instance, Orgyen Tobgyal, the child obsessed with football, was a very easily despised character right up until the last few minutes of the movie. He was obnoxious, self-centered, and thoughtless. It took the entire hour and a half for him to mature into a thinking and caring human being.
