[V],felch,2006-04-07T18:02Z,I forgot to mention this movie is in PAL format...  Also PLEASE KEEP SEEDING for a few days after you download so that this turns into a fast torrent :-)

Cover ... perchance?"
[V],felch,2006-04-07T19:36Z,"hmmmm well, apart from the miniscule cover on IMDB, I'm afraid you got me there...  But a quick Google Image search revealed this:

,peizan,2009-07-07T15:39Z,Would anybody seed pleeeeease?  
,KOGR,2011-01-04T11:03Z,"Please someone seed this, I will seed it back for a whole year."
,KOGR,2011-01-19T20:21Z,"felch could you seed this again for a bit? I will keep it alive. I am also keeping kekexili alive for more than a year or so, and if I am not mistaken thats the only copy of kekexili thats still active. I will do the same for this one if someone would just seed it for as long as it takes me to download it."

,Ecquillii,2012-04-22T20:11Z,"With DHT and PEX, over two dozen of us stuck at 58.3% for two weeks. Any help available?"
,Ecquillii,2012-06-07T01:31Z,"Two months and still stuck at 58.3%. Every now and then a seeder appears for a few minutes, but then disappears before any advance is made. New peers keep joining the swarm, so the interest is there."
