How about a little more? Any subs?"
,chossein,2006-03-28T16:41Z,Sibbeee If you don't like the info then don't download it! It says Full DVD not ripped dvd figure it out.  With the thousands that download I'm I going to please everyone? No so I will post what pleases me.
,chossein,2006-03-29T18:27Z,As I am saying once again I did not take anything out all I did was use DVD shirn*

Thanks for insulting me like that.  I used shrink becasue I only have a 4.7 burner on my laptop and thats the computer I copied it on.  
You don't have to download it if you don't like the info.  
 I am not here to write reviews if you want it d/l it if not don't.  
Thanks again enjoy the movie. "
,chossein,2006-04-03T00:40Z,taxevader - Also pretty funny you blast me like that companin about the speed and still download it LOL HAHAHA.  Secondly I am a home user not a server so my internet connection is only what my service offers (note the speed for the last 4 days on my end shows 89.4k/bs.  Also I have 6 emails from people thanking me for the post and they really enjoyed the movie.

,napster46,2006-07-23T11:43Z,"Maybe a Stupid question, but this is the FIRST Carlito's Way From '93??? Right?"
,napster46,2006-08-08T11:10Z,"Tell me, what's wrong with this torrent? I started dl this, july 23th and I'm not finished yet.... I miss 5MB of this file, and have done that for a week now... What's happening here?"
,napster46,2006-08-09T12:09Z,Will anyone please SEED this for 30 minutes?
,napster46,2006-08-09T13:14Z,"SEED 4 Christ sake.... and dont put your settings as a ""Seeder"". You dont upload anything in that position. 
Come On!!!!"
,chossein,2006-08-13T22:48Z,"Sorry guys, after   let it run for 2 weeks back in march I stopped by seeding I was hoping ppl would keep it alive (reason behind torrents is it not?).  Not on my cpu anymore.  this is a good leason to everyone if you download something leave it seeding for at least a week not 24hrs."
,napster46,2006-08-15T19:44Z,"Yea yea yea, thanx 4 the 'lesson', but I can't use that 4 anything...

Thanx 4 nothing, but waste of time!!!"
,chossein,2006-08-24T16:09Z,Not really my problem is it?  You would expect me to u/l a movie in march and keep it on my CPY until August? Get real?
,napster46,2006-09-05T18:30Z,bullshit.... but 4get it.
