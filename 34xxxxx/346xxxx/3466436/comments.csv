,Noplis,2006-04-04T19:00Z,"Hehehe The reason *BEEP* isnt working is because ""The big kahuna"" isnt home and can fix the problem. Thats at least what I have heard..It will work in a couple of days I think and hope."
,patno.1,2006-04-04T19:22Z,THX Noplis
,SnowDOG_,2006-04-04T20:55Z,OMFG!! Thaaank you! About time! Been checking the net every 2hours since sunday for this video!! Cant fucking wait!! :D 
,Noplis,2006-04-04T21:00Z,This was aired a little more then 12 hors ago so it havnt been possible to get this one much faster...But for example the korean version was out on the net earlier becasue of an earlier airtime.
,Wurzel7,2006-04-04T21:00Z,Thanks Noplis
,elric1,2006-04-04T21:14Z,Thank you! =)
,elric1,2006-04-04T21:16Z,Looks like I'm not the only one that can't access mma-tracker. =/
,skkane,2006-04-04T21:17Z,"Thank you! Been searching for this since Sunday. Can anyone who got it and watched it tell me if Baroni vs Kondo is included in the RIP? Asking because the word is that it was not aired on the US PPV (i'm guessing this is it) since they will show the fight on Fox Sports or some shit like that...

Thanks"
,Noplis,2006-04-04T21:42Z,"Damn...totally forgot to include what version it was....Sorry about that..Yes this is the US PPV, and no the baroni vs kondo is not included.  If I get my hands on some good quality rips of the single fights I will put them here if you want..But it will be in korean or japanese."
,skkane,2006-04-04T22:01Z,Hmm. If you are from the US check out FSN (fox sports network i think) if you have that. They are supposed to air Baroni vs Kondo in a few days. Check out Sherdog.com forum for more info on FSN.
,skkane,2006-04-04T22:03Z,Ooh. Any idea why all the time with new torrents i never get to download from the 100% seeds? I was able to get from a 100% guy for a few minutes and i was getting around 130kb/s or so untill i got shut off and getting with around 30kb/s now from the smaller % users.
,Pudas33,2006-04-04T22:21Z,Tack som fan :)

,B-Soc,2006-04-05T03:00Z,Then a hero came along named Noplis!!!
,Sektion8,2006-04-05T06:12Z,"Noplis... More than ever, YOU DA MAN! Seriously, I was ready to give myself a rear-naked choke when *BEEP* died the other day... I've been LOST without it ARGGGGH!!! I'm on the mailing-list to, which I thought I'd be emailed about it going down. Can't even up what I've got anymore. Any idea/news what's gonna happen with UFN & TUF? I can't thank you enough man! Regards, Devast8r06.  PS. Baronis vs. Kondo is supposedly unmissable! And It WAS on google video or youtube (can't remember) but has been pulled?! Never got to see it )c:"
,oneder1,2006-04-05T08:09Z,"thanks for this!
so does anyone know what happened to *BEEP*???... is it down for good or something?"
,capchris,2006-04-05T12:52Z,"Nice!
Really good work, Noplis!
Sure hope that *BEEEEEP* will be back soon though.
The thing I hate about TPB is that everybody is so greedy!
I started to DL yesterday, but had to stop before I should sleep.
Back then, 300 ppl where leeching.
today, only 54 are seeding... Not that bad, but where are the others?
GAH :@"
,Nitr0xx,2006-04-05T13:06Z,=) =) =)
,jone1,2006-04-05T15:30Z,can anyone upload missing fights ??
,Maaksi,2006-04-05T15:47Z,"I'm noob, i know..but how you guys watch these files...i can't extract these correctly...do you burn these first..or how..?"
,hazard01,2006-04-05T16:04Z,"thanx uploader this is the greatest fight show in the world and the norwegian joachim hansen¨

,Laredo,2006-04-05T22:08Z,"ok, no you got me curious....tell me about the ""beep"""
,Mittim,2006-04-05T23:03Z,Thanx for this dude.  I have been in a panic since the tracker went down.
,Sektion8,2006-04-06T03:07Z,"LAREDO: The reason for *Beep* is because it's NOT to be discussed in public, sorry. It's a private tracker, and it's 100% important we don't discuss it here. CAPCHRIS: Why can't your PC download while you're asleep?"
,elijah666,2006-04-06T03:38Z,"Thanks Noplis, great spectacular fights in this one!!!!"
,capchris,2006-04-06T18:02Z,"Sektion8: My computer makes a lot of weird noices, and I've got it next to my bed.
In fact, it makes so loud and funny noices that I can't even watch movies in my room with it on, because my friends complain about it, it's that loud :D

I hope that *BEEEP* is coming back soon though :( 
UFN and TUF3 is on it's way."
,JonnySak,2006-04-06T20:49Z,"thanks noplis

I would of leached of you on DC++ but I lost my entire 300 gig mma harddrive.  I can't log in anymore.

hopefully the tracker will get back online soon."
,robmafia,2006-04-06T21:11Z,"ha.  i didn't realize so many of us from *beep* are on here.

i haven't received any emails from them, either.  i heard it was receiving dos attacks, though.  not sure if that's true or bs.

anyway, thanks for the upload.  it's appreciated."
,a02fadyo,2006-04-07T01:21Z,when i unpack i get a message from win rar that the package is corrupt!!! what should i do???
,sakutakanori,2006-04-07T02:03Z,"Thanks for the upload Noplis,
atleast i know that im not the only one having a BEEEP of a time getting into BEEEP.  BTW i like how you guys are keeping BEEEP on the down low, lol"
,capchris,2006-04-07T16:24Z,"how could you have gotten an email, when I haven't? =( I am sure that I signed up for that e-mail stuff.
I really hope you are lying! :@

If the tracker is down, we might have to pay for MMA - haha, not very likely! We will find another way! "
,capchris,2006-04-07T16:26Z,"ah, checked my other e-mail, found out what you where saying is true.
I think it will be back up though, don't know why you are so negative! cmon, it will be up soon... it has to!"
,sambat,2006-04-08T01:05Z,"everybody should just start posting mma shit on here instead of beep.  this site isnt great stability wise but its more central, and better than beep, as far as stability goes.  dcc is so damn hard to dl off too, whoever gets it on dc should post it here."
,sakutakanori,2006-04-08T22:06Z,Hey guys BEEEP is back up
,cvydas,2006-04-09T20:23Z,"can someone please uplaod the missing fights, i completely missed them last night on FSN. thanks. and thanks for the up Noplis."

You tools aren't really ""keeping it a secret""... if you want to know about a REAL well-kept secret, try and get into the MMA darknet (Try it, I dare ya!) ;p"
