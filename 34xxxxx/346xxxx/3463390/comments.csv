,UK_PsychoBob69,2006-04-20T16:15Z,"Thx 4 upload. Video quality = 8/10, Sound quality=8/10. Great stuff"
,markoramius,2006-04-22T19:07Z,"GSpot tells me that this movie only requires an AC3 filter for sound, which I already have installed. Why can't I hear any sound then?"
,roopoo,2007-01-01T19:29Z,"DJBCP Codec pack should sort out the sound probs. It affects the video quality a lil though...

On another note, yay for the bears..."
,Serendipity29,2007-09-29T17:57Z,"This movie is great! It makes you realize what assholes bears are and how tasty his Grizzly Man's girlfriend must be.

Mmmmm

Girlfriend.."

,sandyhair,2009-01-18T05:42Z,"I watched this last night and I was completely  transfixed.  Does it matter that the guy was not quite the same as you or I?  It's an incredible story - whether you admire Tim Treadwell or not - and it is starkly told by Herzog in his narration and direction.  A beautiful, beautiful film which has reinforced my own belief that characters in fiction can never match the untold stories of people we will never have the chance to meet in our own lives."
,Adportas,2009-03-16T10:47Z,"Awesome documentary! Bear Grills has a show in discovery channel and in one of the episodes he eats bear shit, i started to laugh my ass off after i thought about what had happen to the idiot and his gf in this documentary.  Was Bear Grills committing cannibalism, was just one of the thoughts running amok in my head. Also for the idiots that think we are being rude because we are laughing at the f**kers misfortune, come on man he was trying to befriend bears and none of them where named Whiny the Pooh. "
,BC604,2009-08-14T04:34Z,Thanks a bunch!! this docudrama is fucking hillarious. the narrators voice is too die over and timothy is as gay as elton john.. good movie!  you'll laugh your ass off....
,Zyl0s,2009-09-24T04:57Z,"Well said sandyhair. I think the only thing Treadwell did wrong was get his girlfriend killed, but she knew the risks when she tagged along (and she even admitted to being afraid of bears to begin with!). That aside, Timothy lived and died doing something that he enjoyed immensely, and that's more than most people can say."
