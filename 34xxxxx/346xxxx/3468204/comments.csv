You're required (Past lvl 7) to use more spells than you can have equipped (2 offensive spells and bam, you don't have any more space. Monsters are sometimes immune to one of your offensive spells, so yes, you need two. This means you can't heal or teleport or... well you get the point).

Still, a good game. Too much microing for me though."
