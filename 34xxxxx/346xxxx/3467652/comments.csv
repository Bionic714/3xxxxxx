enjoy..."
,swy000,2006-04-27T23:54Z,"MortenCB: my advice to you ir to get an external hard disk (preferebly an internal HD with an external encolusure for future uses). That way you can keep all what you want on your computer, and use the external drive for movies...."
,ranis,2006-05-18T11:27Z,"Pleeeeease help me, i've got panic!! Season 10 and 2 isn't working!!! :( 

I can scroll through menus in both seasons, and in s10 I can even watch the special features! But when I try opening an episode, VLC crashes (Or goes into small mode, you know, like when a file isn't compatible.) They are unwatchable... :I

ALL other seasons work just fine! It's just s2 and s10 that is fucked up :(

Please, help me find a solution! :("

Season 2&10 don't work when you press play in vlc. All the otherones do!
Thx for the sharing anyway!"
,silkthinker,2009-09-21T19:18Z,"@ Comp-Nerd: you're really not that nerd, are u? it's stated in the description: ""you will need to buy yourself 10 Double Layer DVD's.""

you need DL (dual layer) dvds. you can use ImgBurn software, a dual layer burner and dual layer discs.

are these the extended episodes? i have seen a bit of previews but i just wonder. btw, the menu is great and the fact that english subs are available is just icing on the cake. thanx!!!"
,_Zotov_,2010-04-27T20:39Z,"C'mon folks, don't be stingy. Seed for others too.
I'm seeding 1st part like 500 KBite/s but it's no use without second part."
