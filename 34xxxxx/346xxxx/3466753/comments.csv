,Adrock4,2008-10-12T01:26Z,This torrent is missing Closer (Deviation).
,pearly27,2008-10-30T09:20Z,"Yeah, as stated by the last guy, this torrent is missing track 3 - Closer (Deviation). It's also missing the album version of Closer as the final track, but you shouldn't have too much trouble finding it. I'm going to see if the Deviation remix is on Limewire or something.

Otherwise, good torrent."
,pearly27,2008-10-31T08:51Z,"Wait up. I just realised that the original version of Closer is there after all, but the Artist is tagged as something like ""Nine Inch Nails            "" so it won't be with the rest of your NIN."
