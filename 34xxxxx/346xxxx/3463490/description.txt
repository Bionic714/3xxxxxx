In my opinion this is one of the best PDF editors and viewers on the market.  It does not clog system resources unlike acrobat and has many more functions.  You can even use it to remove the trial watermarks generated by other programs!  Take a look at the manufacturer?s description below:

?PDF Plus fully supports the latest PDF 1.6 specification and it is a cost effective, reliable and easy to use tool in editing PDF documents, for corporations, governments, as well as individual users. 
PDF Plus enables users to get advanced controls over PDF document output and provides flexible Annotation/mark up capabilities plus the powerful ability to view, print, make bookmark, extract and combine pages into a new PDF documents. It also allows user to insert, extract, delete and rotate easily, and re-order pages from multiple PDF files to produce one PDF file. 
PDF Plus is a convenient and powerful tool for creating, marking up and managing PDF files under all Windows Operating Systems.?

You will not find this program on any other warez sites as I have only just decided to release it from my personal collection.

Life?s to short to play by the rules!
