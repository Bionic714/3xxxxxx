,Onizuka3,2009-10-14T00:56Z,"This torrent doesn't have legit 320kps of music.
I downloaded this just to get Sappy in 320, cause previously I only had it in 128. Not good enough. When I compared to 2 files though, but were the exact same wave length. This torrent is bullshit. Guy just converted the 128 file to 320. Which doesn't do shit but make it bigger file size."
