,EngineerJD,2006-04-05T02:13Z,"When i tried to open this *.avi fail, my BS player crashed. Windows Explorer crashed too.
The system is Win XP pro with SP2.
Then i try rendered the file with my GSpot v.2  and got a message:
"
,EngineerJD,2006-04-05T02:14Z,"Warning: DirectShow crashed while attempting to render this file.
This is usually due to damaged, misconfigured, conflicting, or poorly written codec drivers.  It is possible, perhaps even likely, that other media players will crash when they attempt to play this file as well, as most of them will also use DirectShow.  GSpot was able to intercept the crash, and has attempted to identify the codec or filter involved; uninstalling or reinstalling this codec or filter may solve the problem.
The codec was tentatively identified as:
D:WINDOWSsystem32mpeg2dmx.ax"
,EngineerJD,2006-04-05T02:14Z,"This file is a Direct Show Filter
I took off this file from WINDOWSsystem32 with: cut and paste and put it in my own place.
For now the BS player and Windows Explorer is working OK on this and others files."
