Proper notes:

Can we all say 'havent this been tried and failed before'?

When we checked their sample, and tried making a sample at the same spot, theirs is
9mb, ours is 17mb.  

Taking up the grand tradition of quality, xor's 24 was mostly done at a constant 
bitrate, with the last part presumably adjusted to fit the 350mb size.  See pic.

shitty encode, shitty quality from a shitty group.

Here's a properly encoded 2 pass release.
