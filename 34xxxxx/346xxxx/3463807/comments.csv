,aveerara,2006-04-06T23:11Z,Can someone tell me if this is a DVD rip or a TV rip? Thanks. 
,anaalitappi,2006-04-07T07:05Z,"Tv-rips mostly, i think it might have a few dvd rips as well..not sure. Great quality though."
,osmog001,2006-04-12T06:44Z,"The ""previously on battlestar galactica"" intros do on several occasions display scenes that are not included in the actual episodes. I'm assuming that a couple of minutes here and there were lost in the recording process of or something. "
,(tuesday),2006-05-02T14:32Z,"no osmog, that happens in a number of episodes -- scenes that ended up being cut from the show are shown in the 'what will happen in this episode' bit -- it doesn't mean there's anything missing in the recording."
,yioula,2006-05-18T21:21Z,wow!   -----> that's tv series! please help me with your seeds! greetings!

,Naxon_255,2006-09-20T22:00Z,"i heard the third season is being aired early october on the scifi channel.
however, those outside the us are doomed to wait 'till the dvd box comes out.

so i ask you; any plans on uploading a tv version or something just after the air date?"

,denthetrader,2007-03-25T17:24Z,"Kiiti Diileri! Hyvä liideri... Mulla olikin vain downattu ""complete season 2"" jossa oli sit se 10 osaa, ja kelasinkin miten vitussa season voi jäädä sellaseen ""cliffhangeriin"" (Fuck the s.o.b. Renny Harlin btw.. ;) kesken... 
Odottelin sit hikipäissäni kolmoskautta liian, liian pitkään. Enkä tajunnut ennen season 3 downloadausta mistä olin jäänyt paitsi, kun tsiigasin ""previously on bsg..."" KOVIN paljon oli tapahtunut ""mustassa aukossa"" sillä välin... 

Blaah! Helvetti kun nykyisin löytyy näit kaikennäkösii ""rippaajia"" jotka kehtaa postaa season torrentin MAINITSEMATTA et VAAN puolet episoodeista puuttuu. Fuck 'dem. Moista paskaa ei BBS aikoina hyväksytty alkuunkaan, muistanet.. Oishan sitä tietysti voinut ottaa varmuuden millon vaan, mut kun kaikki PC-aika menee muissa diilauksissa ja DDO-Onlinessa, Hmm... Hyvä et Suomessa osataan ;-)  

...Anyways cheers fellow dealer! I WILL STAY ON SEEDING for a long time when completed. (U kinda saved Me from frakkin' nervous breakdown by posting this M8). "
,azoapes,2007-10-31T00:52Z,"This torrent has lived for almost two years now =) Is there anyone out there that still has it and is able to seed? It runs at 10 KB/s now. Sometimes cranks up to 15 or so, but it's gonna take two weeks with this speed!"
,johanponken,2007-11-09T20:54Z,"I say invest in http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3639072 - double the size, but no glitches and no blips of commercials in cuts. The picture is also rather muzzy. I have season 1 in 350MB episodes, and that picture was clear. Haven't found that for S2; maybe single dowloads of course..."
,kralcx,2007-12-04T20:53Z,Thanks for this!  I've just learned about Battlestar Galactica and was looking for this.  Good quality and it downloaded for me quickly.

,dark9mail,2008-08-17T13:30Z,common yall.. please seeddddddddd
,Cicer0,2008-08-20T03:26Z,"It may be seeding a little slow, so all I'd recommend is going into Utorrent and doing the following:

Turn the first five into priority HIGH
Next five NORMAL
And the rest to LOW

Then the first five will dl first and you can enjoy them and as you watch one, turn another to HIGH priority and at the same time, one to NORMAL.

It helps a lot. Trust me. And also, is it just me, or BSG just way too fucken good? Seriously. Too good."
,classic23,2008-09-06T15:03Z,ppl plz seed... i've been downloading this for over 3 days now and i'm still geyttin speeds like 10kbps or so... i promise to seed for a month...

,abhijit_net,2009-04-23T01:21Z,"Is there a DVDRip version of this one ?

DVDrips are a lot high quality that TVrips."
[T],spotswood,2009-05-10T00:34Z,does this video cover an entire widescreen tv?
[T],spotswood,2009-05-16T09:54Z,"the last episode in this season (episode 20) seems out of place.  can anyone confirm this?  as if the season 3 opener is squished in with the season 2 finale.   if you haven't been at that point yet, eventually you'll understand what i'm talking about."
