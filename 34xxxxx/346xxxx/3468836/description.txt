Recorded live at Orstedparken, Copenhagen on the date specified in the title, Sun Electric switch gears from their previous albums Kitchen and Aaah!, to present a completely ambient, mostly beatless musical environment. Whereas earlier records had presented lush synths and electro beats, and future releases would feature drum n' bass beats with a side of ambient, this album presents full-on sumptuous ambience in the vein of Global Communication's 76:14 or Brian Eno's Ambient 4: On Land. Tom Thiel and Max Loderbauer are completely at the top of their game here, effortlessly generating and mixing loops for over 60 minutes into a seamless tapestry of sound. Repeating keyboard motifs, subtle percussion, and a sample from "A Hard Day's Night" are joined together in the meticulously constructed "Castor & Pollux," the highlight of the concert. This is truly an ambient classic, one of the greatest of the genre, and an excellent place for those new to ambient music to start.
