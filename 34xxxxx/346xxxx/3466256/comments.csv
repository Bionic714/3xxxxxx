,Melfenion,2006-04-04T16:39Z,He is seeding :)
,xboxerstuart,2006-04-04T22:20Z,"my bad..., downloaded ok............but i thought it was a game!what exactly is it?"
,Big_Bowl_Brown,2006-04-04T22:51Z,"It is the Quake 3 for the PC but made to run on the xbox.I think I got the  files at xbins.It was a while ago.It should run from a disk after you burn the iso file.I run it off my  xbox.
Any more questions just ask.I will try to answer"
,xboxerstuart,2006-04-04T22:53Z,"thanks bbb....i panicked when it started installing stuff!!!!!i had a bad experience last week,erased the ms dash by mistake on my mates box.....doh!"
,xboxerstuart,2006-04-04T22:55Z,"so after it has finished its intial install,the game will start???  "
,Big_Bowl_Brown,2006-04-05T02:39Z,"The game is not installing its just loading up
Blue screen with all this Quake stuff
Then it stops just wait and it will start.
It kinda freaked me out to thr first time.
I have run from disk and it worked fine but that was before I added all the extra stuff.Some of the mods will make it crash because they were not made to run on the box."
,Big_Bowl_Brown,2006-04-05T02:58Z,"the best way to get it on the xbox,if it dosent run from the disk.
Unrar all the files untill you get the ISO file, then use Qwix to load the iso file into your xbox.I know it will work then."
,Big_Bowl_Brown,2006-04-05T03:34Z,Just woundering.Is it working for you?
,xboxerstuart,2006-04-05T10:11Z,"oh  by the way, i burned to disc. everything on it ,cheers mate"

,Bleak5170,2006-04-10T18:27Z,"Thanks Triple B. This is really well done. For some reason my view wants to default to looking straight down at the floor, but hopefully I can fix that. "
,mr_sticky,2006-04-10T22:45Z,hey this port rocks! i hooked up a usb keyboard and mouse and it works flawlessly. Kudos to the hard work put into porting this awesome game.
,Bleak5170,2006-04-12T14:03Z,"Orton,

   Did you extract it first so that an ISO was created? You have to do that before burning the image onto a DVD."
,Big_Bowl_Brown,2006-04-19T07:20Z,"Use Qwix to ftp the ISO file into your Xbox.If you want you can also make ISO's using this program.
