,stoneskid,2006-04-09T08:51Z,"can anyone that has already downloaded this please tell us if this indeed does work with 5.21?  
Thanks"
,pushf12,2006-04-12T06:45Z,"These maps work with the 5.21 patch for Palm, but a keygen or crack is still required."
,promethus,2006-04-19T10:41Z,"So....

Can anyone tell us if this torrent works by itself?

Or are we all wating for a keygen?

Thanks."
,qwerty1900,2006-04-24T20:55Z,"These maps work only with 5.00.  For 5.21 they do not exist.  One exception, neither one recognizes Canada-Map on CD1.  ASUS636 WM5."
,studio999,2006-05-04T21:57Z,"Installed Maryland map in TT 5 ver 5.1; map is not detected, any tips? Does it work for tt5 ver 5.1 anyway?"

,gordongeko,2007-02-26T04:37Z,"This is a fantastic find and exactly what I was looking for, for my forthcoming trip. The archive includes the cracked V5.0000 of TomTom for Pocket PC and all 8 of the the original install CDs for the US and Canada maps. Took me 6 days to download all 4.4gig of the 313 rar archives! They (slightly surprisingly) reassembled fine back to two iso image files.

For those that are asking, the cracked v5.21 TomTom, which I also have, does not see these maps, only the European ones it seems. However the cracked v5.0000 sees both European and US/Canada maps. 

Happy navigating!"

,none1445,2007-07-08T03:17Z,"Now that I have downloaded this torrent, I'm not sure what to do next in order for all the rar. files I've downloaded to work.  I would appreciate it if someone tells me what I should do next.  Gordenko said that he ""reasembled"" the files into two iso. files.  how do u do that?"
,michrouf,2008-01-01T11:48Z,I'll check if it works with 5.000 version
