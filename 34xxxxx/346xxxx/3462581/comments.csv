,Xeno2007,2006-03-28T12:16Z,"Sorry I forgot to mention:

This is the Pro version 3.5.641.6214 (458)

And no - I didn't just make those numbers up either :p (must be the longest version number in history)."
,MountainLion,2006-04-04T18:26Z,Thanx this is perfect. good post
,Zygi-PL,2006-04-25T23:50Z,"Always give version number in torrent name, its lot easier to find newest one. 5/5 for good will :P"
,crazydrive,2006-04-26T11:04Z,hey guys...i tried to instal this version..i had an older one..i first uninstalled the other completely restarted ...and used registry cleaners (2 programs) to be sure that all of older outpost was gone:-)  but when i installedthis version something strange happened...it did install correctly:-) but then when i wanted to update it with thier update button..it downloaded 9mb of information and then it asked for restart...i did that...and when it restarted it said i had an invalid key..no matter what i did aftrewards...did i do anything worng..we need to update..or else we are not protected...maybe another way to install or bypass this problem?? anyone else has the same problem? in the past..until today (outpast asked for an update...maybe a thing like microsofts has..a validation tool?)HELP!!!!! i live on outpost...its by far the best firewall and believe i used all the others at least once! 
,DeepPirate,2006-05-10T18:14Z,"yeah, I have the same problem...once it updated, it won't accept the old key.  :("
,Xeno2007,2006-05-11T00:25Z,Odd. I'm still using mine and it's fine. Every once in a while it asks for the key again - and I just input it and it's fine.
,Xeno2007,2006-05-11T00:28Z,I assure you that this does work. Since I uploaded this 3 months ago - I've reinstalled this operating system twice (general clean up only takes an hour) and quickly reinstalled outpost (yesterday was the last time) and updated it - it's fine. Never realised anyone was having problems. 
,Xeno2007,2006-05-11T00:29Z,I didn't crack this. I got it from a private site - where no-one mentioned any problems. You're the only 2 to have said anything. I've not experienced any problems myself. Wish I could help you - but have no idea why you would be having problems. Anyone else have any ideas?
,Rolle12,2006-05-20T15:08Z,Seed folks.
