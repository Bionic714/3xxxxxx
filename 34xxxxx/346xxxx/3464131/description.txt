From the original ripper:

"The music for Disgaea is excellent, and widely varied, withpieces ranging from classical and operatic to cheesy sentai to techno,and yet there was never an official soundtrack release for the game.The Japanese Limited Edition release of the game came with a 2-CDsoundtrack set, but this is nearly impossible to get your hands on;MP3s can be had, but at varying bitrates and quality. Also, the NorthAmerican release of the game added 9 tracks not present on the LEsoundtrack, and even that soundtrack didn't loop the music in mostcases, stopping after a single play, which is particularly unsatisfyingon many of the game's driving battle pieces."
