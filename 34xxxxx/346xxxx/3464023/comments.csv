Im sorry but you kinda deserve that.

YES, its all one file, YES its a brilliant rip.

If you want all the tracks, use the .cue and burn it to CD. I simply burnt that cue file to virtual cd using nero 7; and when i mount the CD the tracks come up fine. Re-rip thoose if your so worried about having individual tracks.

In other words: Burn it & its fine (at least with nero 7)."
