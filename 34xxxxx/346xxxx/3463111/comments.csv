Hey people .. what player do you use ?
iTunes is the player of all time in my opinion
Great music. Thanks uploader..."
,VonNegga,2010-08-22T10:58Z,"^^^^^ Yea, so I can find the files on my hard drive somewhere and wonder who the fuck the song is by and not know until I load it up in a player to read the shitty tag.  If the artist is part of the file name, you'll know just by a quick glance.  You're an ignorant fuck and iTunes blows about as much as you do, so fuck off."
