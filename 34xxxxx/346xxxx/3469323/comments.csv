,myauntpaw,2011-05-27T20:15Z,"I started to download this but it was going really slow. When downloads go that slow, I tend to just abort the download for fear of a trojan. Anybody else download this and have no problems?

THANKS!"
,myauntpaw,2011-06-19T22:02Z,"OK. So tried downloading this again. (I really want this CD.) It was still downloading incredibly slow. Its been downloading for almost a week and it finally just got stuck on 76.8%.. I don't know what could be wrong with it, but you don't need to waste your time trying to download it. :/"
