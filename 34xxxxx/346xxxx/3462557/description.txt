Assembled from two prior EP's.
A worthy addition to the Chameleons legacy. 
Gutarists Fielding and Smithies teamed up with a fine, expressive vocalist in Gary Lavery. It may have been Mark Burgess who provided the lyrical insights that typified The Chameleons' records but Dave and Reg's intertwining, shimmering guitars and keyboards were the key to the sense of voluminous ambience they excelled in.
This is, at times, a vast record. Tracks like "This Savage Garden" and "Start To See" are so soaring and expansive they punch a hole in the ozone, while Lavery's plaintive vocals on "These Days" bring to mind The Scars' awesome yearning.
While a slightly less intense proposition than The Chameleons, The Reegs have maintained their almost detached, stately grandeur and melodic magnificence. If there's a fault with the album it's that it's been recorded over a considerable period and hence lacks Flow. What it does show, however, is that Fielding and Smithies are still up there, striving and searching for the big music.
