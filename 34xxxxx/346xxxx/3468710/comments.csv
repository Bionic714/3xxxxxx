"
,prototajp,2006-04-09T20:05Z,"foo89:
Do you have this in DVD9 (full 1:1 copy) or a copy with the extras included?. 
The reason i ask is because the extras contains an alternative ending of the movie which i've been told is much better than the one in the org. movie.
If you or anybody get hold of it, please upload."
,foo89,2006-04-09T20:36Z,I will rip the alternative ending seperately. Just a few moments.
,foo89,2006-04-09T21:17Z,"Alternative Ending can be found here:
