However the files have this wierd half second pause every 3-4 seconds when I play them.
Has anyone else experienced this? Do I have to change any settings to run these? or was something wrong with the download?"

,SeattleEse,2008-07-12T22:10Z,"Great Torrent, days and days of audio to listen to.  It will take me a few weeks for the Fellowship alone.

Just to let people know this is great for your ipod or mp3 player.  Don't bother making a cd unless your car can use a data/mp3 disc.

One minor minor flaw, I have to mention is the chapters cut off, maybe a few sentences short.  Nothing major, nothing that detracts from the overall quality, just a minor thing that will throw you off the first time you hear it."
