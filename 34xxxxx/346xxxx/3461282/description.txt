  Crystallization - DVB Pumpkins
==================================

This might just be the only disc of it's kind.
It contains lossless audio AND video Pumpkins,
which remains something of a rarity to this day.

Though the quality vary between the clips, it represents
the best available source, at least as of yet, for each one of them.
They are by all but stringent academic standards identical to the respective
broadcasts sent out in the first place.

But this is not enough.
Loads of greatness awaits, most any Pro Video would've had or could've had
a source broadcast just as great, wasted on vhs or dvdrecorders.

Do you want more?
The Rockpalast clip comes from a complete concert that has been
aired at least once a year 1996-2001, but never since.
The people responsible for the broadcasts are likely Pumpkins fans,
and regardless in many aspects unique in the way they allow feedback
from their audience to influence their programming.

Please make the (trivial) effort of requesting the complete concert.
Rockpalast will almost certainly heed to the call if a few hundred,
heck, a few ten, would contact them.

A few select phrases of German:
German:
-------
[1] "Konnten Sie das Konzert 'the Smashing Pumpkins' von 1996 bitte zeigen?
Ich sah 'Today' vor kurzem und es war Super!"
[2] "Zeigen Sie bitte dem Konzert 'the Smashing Pumpkins' von 1996!"
[3] "Mehr Smashing Pumpkins bitte!"
[4] "er Clip der Smashing Pumpkins war groß. Mehr von diesem Rockpalast!"

English:
--------
[1] "Could you show the concert 'the Smashing Pumpkins' from 1996 please?
I saw 'Today' recently and it was super!"
[2] "Please show the concert 'the Smashing Pumpkins' from 1996!"
[3] "More Smashing Pumpkins please!"
[4] "the Smashing Pumpkins clip was great. More of that Rockpalast!"

These, combined with some limited linguistic wit, and babelfish,
should make your requests legible enough.

I will continue to record any DVB Pumpkins I can get my hands on,
but this would be quite a big thing. Equally so, any effort taken
by the community towards this would signal praise and motivation to my ongoing pursuit.

If these little dvds I post means something to people,
then surely this concert, yet to be recorded, means something too?
How much? Does the immense tremble and effort of communicating some lines
in German really surpass the joy you would feel, had you that concert right now?

You decide.

Peace,

Recorded with Hauppauge Nova-S CI, except for MTV Live: Today
and Studio Pop: Billy Corgan, recorded with Nokia 9902s.
Software includes ProgDVB, DVBPortal, MyTheatre and MediaMex.

All files were checked with ProjectX to assure that no signal loss had occurred.
Furthermore the actual files were checked with Mpeg2repair to ensure their
consistency towards the mpeg2-standard.

I&I was repaired because it had a minor error that would cause a single video glitch
with some players. It now exhibits none of this or any sign whatsoever that would
conject it's perfection. (Check it yourself, "In you I count stars!")

I&I = Star! (Sweden)
Bowie = Onyx (Germany, now defunct.)
Mtv Live = MTV2 (UK)
Studio Pop = SVT1 (Sweden)
Rockpalast = WDR (Germany)

.MD5   (regular checksum)
*.PAR2 (advanced checksum that includes parity bytes, for recovery)

You need to copy the checksum files to the VIDEO_TS dir in order to verify the dvd.
They cannot be placed there when you burn the disc, it would break the dvd-standard.

The par2 files will help you recover from a partially damaged(scratched) disc.
Simply copy everything to HDD and run quickpar with the par2-files.
