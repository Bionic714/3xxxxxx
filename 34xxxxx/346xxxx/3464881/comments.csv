,tomtomx,2006-04-02T14:10Z,BTW: The IMDB link doesn't lead to IMDB. As always with rci's upoalds it leads to one of his favourite nazi-sites...
,tomtomx,2006-04-02T18:54Z,There will be no peacefull future as long as small palestinian children in school are learnt that the best thing you can achive in life is to blow yourself to bits... Who's the barbarians?
,tomtomx,2006-04-02T19:48Z,"If the arabs in the palestinian areas really want peace, maybe a good first step is to get their government to stop demanding the annihilation of israel and the killing of all jews and christians living there. That would probably be a nice first step towards ""a peaceful future""... But ""a peaceful future"" side by side with israelis is obviously not what the arabs in the area want. In their rethoric ""a peaceful future"" is the period after they slaughtered every single israeli. Somehow the israelis don't share that vision of the future. Strange..."
