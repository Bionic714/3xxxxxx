,BeastRipper,2006-04-12T22:55Z,"To allow you to install sp2, you might have to run a product key changer, and change to a different key.  With the release of SP2, microsoft banned a number of keys.  Try searching for RockXP...its a program that will allow you to change your product key.  You'll have to find one to change to though"
,solstan,2006-04-17T19:31Z,"Also, IF you got the genuine check started you have to back to a position before that event using system restore OR manually delete all referring things in the registry AND any files in the c:document & settings tree ... there will be some after a failed check. The bad news, you cant uninstall the genuine check this time. The ggod news, the still call all the places GENUINE so you can serch and delete  ;-) Good Luck! "
