,rfc1459,2007-10-17T20:28Z,"The problem with the install might be because it's written in Delphi 1.0 for win32.
It didn't work in xp64, but inside vmware running xp32 it worked."

so if thats the problem and you are using win7 you should be able to right click the installer, goto properties, click the ""compatibility"" tab, check the box at ""run this program in compatibility mode for:"", and just select an older version of the Windows OS until you get one that works.


if i screwed this up, please let me know, i havent tried it yet... so it looks good on paper (kinda, i havent put it on paper either- dont think i need to at this point)."
,nunyasochata,2010-01-08T07:45Z,"nevermind my last...

i installed it in win7 32 bit version and it works great, no wierdness, its ""the algebrator!""

but its kinda clunky...

if you use the ""bagatrix"" ones you will be much happier i think.

,nunyasochata,2010-01-08T07:49Z,"sorry advancen...
