I checked their website http://www.cartrek.info but couldn't see a definitive answer.
Nice post whatever the answer :-)"
,speakeasy,2006-03-30T01:08Z,"Mmm . . . found this:
""The CarTrek is similar to TomTom navigation systems and also uses the mapdata from NAVTEQ"" "
,Rayman30,2006-03-30T01:50Z,"To be clear about it: the software is designed for the CarTrek 200 proprietry car navigation computer. It is kind of similar to the TomTom ONE. I don't think it will work on a PDA, but I'm no expert ;)"
