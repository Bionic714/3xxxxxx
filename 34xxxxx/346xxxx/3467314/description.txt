Trivia: The Nissan Skyline driven by Paul Walker was originally equipped with an all wheel drive system. However, it was converted to rear wheel drive to make the car's maneuvers appear more dramatic. 
Goofs:Continuity: After the scene at the lockup, where Brian says, "Yo, let's break", and the cars begin to leave, we see the Spyder leave, and the driver is wearing orange. Yet when the cars are pulled over by the cops, and Tej and Suki climb out, Suki (driving the Spyder) is wearing black and Tej (Evo) is wearing orange.
