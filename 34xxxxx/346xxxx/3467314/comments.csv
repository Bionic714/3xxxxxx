,donpedro,2006-04-06T16:07Z,"doesn't the ""2"" in the title refer to ""too"" and not really ""two""?

anyway, this one and it's prequel are two of the worst movies I've ever seen. if you have two brain cells, that's two too many (he, funny word play) to actualy like them.

however, if you like cars, and you probably do, download this and fast forward through all the ""content"" and watch the races."

The behind the movie clips are pretty good - don't know if they are one this one..."
