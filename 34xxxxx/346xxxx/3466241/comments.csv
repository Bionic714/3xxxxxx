,Dragolix,2006-07-25T08:37Z,shall i mount or can i just copy the cd1 file to a cd-r?
,Dragolix,2006-07-25T11:13Z,i have mounted the cd1 and it's ok i can run the first part of the install.... then it want the cd 2 and mounted it on a dvd and plug it in and nothing happens i can't get thru the cd change plzzzz help plzz.....!!!!
,Dragolix,2006-07-29T10:55Z,"sry for the 2 last comments i got how to do now and want to help all of you other so when you have downloaded the 2 files just mount em with daemon tools to a virtual hard drive (daemon tools can create virtual drives) then the installation should start automaticly but if it dont you just open ""this computer"" and doubleclick the iotd icon. when the installation wants the cd2 just press ctrl+alt+delete so you can see the daemon tools icon down in the right corner right click it and mount the cd2 file on the same drive you mounted cd1 file on and click ""ok"" button in the installation and it will continue and you'r done!!!                Good Luck!.."

,ezmarjoe,2007-07-11T17:11Z,"The game's better than I thought - Nice graphic, Fantastic sound,easy to controll - ... But if I play with the fire dragon , the screen goes black after 5mins or so. after that the game stops, and windows needs to be restarted: it says the graphic settings must be reseted. Can anybody help me to handle this problem? (have an ATI RAD9250 VGA card, WinXP and the two other dragons really don't crush the game)
Sorry for the bad english."
,SysGhost,2007-08-16T03:40Z,"The gameplay and the genreal idea of the game is ... welll ... 

different.

And I found it interesting. Well the first few levels where just plain boring, but after a few levels and when having access to a few more tricks it got much more fun to play. Don't let the first 10 levels of more or less boredom scare you away, if you like the idea generally.

The storyline however is another... erh... story.
It's bad, really bad.
And the speech aswell as the dialogues are badly written. 
Looks like the script and the speech was made the last 5 minutes before deadline.

The graphics are good, bud also have some varying quality.
For example it seems they put alot of time to make the models of the dragons, and you can even see them evolve as they gain levels. Textures of the dragons are also above average.
In short it seems they put alot of work on the dragons models and less on the rest. 
Once again it seems they went out of time and slapped together rest of the secondary textures the very last 5 minutes before deadline.

As I said earlier, the game itself is interesting and gives much more fun compared to those braindead ""shoot-everything-that-moves-and-win"" games

The game is fun if you can play other games than braindead FPS: ""if it moves, shoot it, if it still moves, shoot it again"" kinda games.

Have fun."
,carnage360,2007-08-31T06:00Z,"alright, i downloaded the game, and it worked fine the first time i played it. I closed out of the game. I went to play it later that day, and i loaded my saved game, but whenever i hit escape or the map button to go to a different area, my computer restarted. So if there is any way of fixing this, could somebody plz let me know, because this is a really good game i could get into."

,Szasz89,2009-11-09T01:56Z,"You guys who have failed with playing are either dumb or very unlucky.

This version works perfectly. Mount, install, run.
Don't even try to find a crack or serial, because they are unnecessary. (Good old games)


A joke for the previous:

Q: Hey guys! Can anyone help me in installing WLM?
A: Next, next, next, finish."
,Darkhog,2009-12-17T15:04Z,"Best game I ever played. For those who have problems: Set compatibility mode with win98 and it will work!

Now... I will seed it 4ever, but I got stuck. When this man on flying carpet told me ""Fly to Golden Woods to the town and meet our King"" i flied all the level but there is no town, and when i want to fly over mountains, and so on my dragon is reversing his flight. Can someone who played this wonderful game (graphics are good, even for today standards) help me with that?"
,tykep,2011-04-09T21:50Z,does anyone know why the flying carpet guy won't talk to me when I start a game? It would be really helpful..
,tykep,2011-04-10T19:22Z,Hey can someone help me? I really wanna be able to play this and when I start a game I don't get the first mission.....
