,luffarungen,2006-04-01T20:08Z,"is this the release from one month ago?

the sound is out of sync from 17 min in I think...use ac3filter to sync it to +200 ms"
,speakeasy,2006-04-01T20:18Z,There are several DVD rips of this out already (and on this site too) . . . go get one of those
,luffarungen,2006-04-05T11:59Z,wish someone would rip this movie without glitches and out-of-sync issues...good work by the scene to not rerelease it
