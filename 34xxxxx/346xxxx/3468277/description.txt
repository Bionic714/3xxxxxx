Tourist Trophy: The Real Riding Simulator (PS2) 


The next game from the people who make Gran Turismo won't be a Gran Turismo game. Polyphony Digital has announced its oft-rumored motorcycle simulator. Titled Tourist Trophy: The Real Riding Simulator, this PS2 title promises to do to two wheels what Gran Turismo did to four.
Polyphony seems to be going all out with this one, with a collection of bikes from big bike makers like Yamaha, Suzuki, Kawasaki and Honda. The developer is even including real life suits and helmets. Polyphony is concentrating on making these bikes control like the real thing. Of course, with motorcycles, cornering is an important part of the race, and, sure enough, changing your riding form during cornering plays a major role in the game.
