,colman,2006-03-28T23:01Z,"Taken from ""queenfanNY"" master 1080i Hi-Definition tapes, this has been down converted to standard def for DVD burning. Hi-Definition and/or Blu-Ray DVD recording capabilities are not yet available.
The standard def video quality in this torrent is still of a higher picture quality though than any other consumer standard def video camera, because the original source Hi-Def quality is so good. The audio is uncompressed LPCM stereo, and is also excellent due to the camera's manual audio recording levels. This 15 minutes of footage is 967 MB in size. It is NTSC region 1."
