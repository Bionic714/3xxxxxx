,moniak,2006-04-03T16:02Z,"Exellent!!!
Many thanks!!"
,Hall_of_zeroes,2006-04-04T17:10Z,"Yeah, i like this game. I want more ISO files uploaded and NO RAR files uploaded. Cos its best with iso. Cos u just have to burn it with Alcohol 120%"
,smokeya9,2006-04-05T12:59Z,awesome
,willski,2006-04-05T20:17Z,"Hall of zeroes - I agree theres not much need for rars with these isos - the game data is normally compressed anyway.

Where are all the new xbox game torrents? there aint many here on piratebay, thats why I started seeding this. I will do another soon after I go to blockbuster. Any requests?"
,PeterPan6,2006-04-05T20:40Z,"With the risk of sounding stupid; Pls, can someone tell me how to burn the .iso file some that the Xbox recognise it? I opened the .iso file in Alcohol 120% and used the Image Burning Wizard to burn it to a DVD. Unfortunately, my Xbox didn't recognise it. BR Desperate"
,Vortexnet,2006-04-05T23:19Z,"Use DVD Decrypter ,worx everytime ;)"
,axellagerlf,2006-04-05T23:38Z,"This doesn't work, the game shows up as ""disk is dirty or damaged"" after the language selection. I even tried ft'ing it onto my xbox but the same message were to be displayed."
,willski,2006-04-06T18:57Z,"should work fine, created with qwix from original disk, are you burning it nice n slow on a good quality ( e.g. ritek dye) dvd-r? xbox dvd drives are very fussy about burnt discs"
,orgen,2006-04-06T21:30Z,"it freezes just after the opening title, anyone lese having this problem? know of a fix somwhere?"
,seigmann_666,2006-04-06T21:34Z,"Hi! I was just wondering..

I'm going to get me a chipped XBOX next week (chip is Xecuter 3).
Is it possible to just transfer this .iso file from PC to the XBOX HDD, or do I need to burn it on a DVD with Alcohol 120 %...?

Hope someone can answer me:)"
,orgen,2006-04-07T13:47Z,"oops, it doesnt freeze after all... i hadent finished the download, works as a charm now!

Seigmann: if you also get a larger harddrive in your xbox, you dont have to burn it, you can then load it directly onto the drive, using eg. QWIX. Just make sure to manually configure your pcs ip to be in the same range as the xbox. Enjoy!"
,dissident,2006-04-07T14:44Z,"I have the same problems, its stands the disk is dirty or damaged after the language selection. What shall I do?"
,seigmann_666,2006-04-07T20:00Z,"to orgen (and everyone who knows:P) :

I'm also getting a 250Gb HDD, so all I need to do is connect the XBOX to my PC, configure my IP from the PC, use QWIX and send the .iso file over to the XBOX??

At least that sounds pretty easy:P"
,makstake,2006-04-07T20:21Z,"seigmann_666: You have extract the iso to your Xbox HDD. You have to transfer the files by ftp, so you'll need either a router or a crossover cable to connect your PC to your Xbox."
,pkancient,2006-04-09T18:07Z,is this playable straight from dvd when burned? or MUST i copy it to my hd?
,Skevast,2006-04-09T22:27Z,"I wonder What languages this game has, another time i downloaded a game for 2 weeks and thereafter discovered that English was not one of them. I dont want to do that mistake again, don't missunderstand me I am greatful for the upload but if this game is not in English I have no use for it...Thanks for the upload"
,ghampus,2006-04-10T18:00Z,"Hello everyone! i don't want to sound noobish, but when I extract the ISO there are only 3 files. Is that in order, or is something wrong?"
,ghampus,2006-04-10T18:10Z,ops never mind :)
,Drunken88,2006-04-10T21:58Z,"How i can open .iso file?
I tried alcohol 120 and powermount or whatever its.
I just cant open that? help plx"
,xboxmovieholland,2006-04-12T22:35Z,"I have a problem, its stands the disk is dirty or damaged after the language selection. What shall I do? this is the second time and it not with the first game.i had several.
"
,willski,2006-04-27T14:16Z,"please use good dvd-r (ritek g05 dye is good) and burn at slowest possible speed. use qwiz ( http://www.teamavalaunch.com/qwix) to do any extraction / transfer to your xbox hdd. marro, stop spamming the listing you lamer."

,DaWiseguy55,2006-05-31T00:27Z,"Hey, It probably doesn't work for you because it is PAL. PAL is the type usually used in Europe. If someone could come out with an NTSC version, that would be great. "
