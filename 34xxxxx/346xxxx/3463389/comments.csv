yes,its true,but on the net everything is possible as u see.lots of good tracks but Tiesto made some mistakes in mixing."
,Adrahil2003,2006-04-28T00:01Z,what is *.cue files?? i have no idea!!
,themafia.69,2006-05-13T07:38Z,masterix: use musicutter it supports cue files and will cut them exactly
,YouOweAdam,2006-08-18T01:09Z,"This is the real full album. As the last guy said, just get musiCutter. The .cue files hold cut points that make for easy cutting of the mp3 files.

musiCutter will use the .cue files to cut the songs into separate files from the big compiled mp3s that you download from here.


good torrent. thanks."
