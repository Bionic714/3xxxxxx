This package contains:
======================

* Aircraft: B747-100, B747-200B, B747-200C, B747-200F, B747-300, B737-200ADV, B727-100, B727-200. 
* Scenery: Old Osaka International Airport.

Some features:
==============

* The Boeing 747s have INS (Inertial Naviation System) to calculate the plane's position for navigating the plane to its course. The INS in a real life is a very complex system. Our system is simplified, so that anyone can easily manipulate the system.
* INS tutorial in the form of Video Movie is included.


Thanks goes out to a.b.w.f.


Happy landings,
