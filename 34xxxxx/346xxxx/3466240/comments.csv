,Kev_T,2006-11-23T17:34Z,Can I ask someone with a full copy to seed this please. We are (and there's about 12 of us!) stuck at 99.5% / 1mb to go.  Ta in advance.
,legendary_goku,2006-11-24T14:15Z,"Yeah i'm also stuck at 99.5%
My ratio for this torrent is already more then 1:1 so i have shared more then i downloaded

thanks for the great up popart!

there are just some greedy bastards who download and don't share at all and that's why torrents die so quickly with many people stuck at 99% or so!

at least share 1:1 so everybody can get it!

There should be a function to ban people that don't have a 1:1 ratio at least!"
,Spectre67,2006-12-22T05:44Z,"Yeah you fucking bastards, learn to seed! learn what the fuck this is all about you newbies.

Been stuck on 99.9% for 3 days, mu upload ratio is 4 to one. How the fuck can we moderate this and throw these leechers out?"
,BA331,2007-01-11T18:01Z,"So did anyone complete downloading?

And can someone please seed!!"
,BA331,2007-01-12T19:43Z,Stuck at 96% please seed!

,saintamadas,2011-06-17T16:45Z,"Where is PopArt? I beseech you by the mercies of God, if its feasible the torrent of this aerosim B737-200ADV should be revived. Waiting forever to get this DL completed. I am still patient as the scriptural Job 14 verse 14. kindly, revive that torrent as i still seed the 50northsim b737s. Thanks and remain blessed! "
,saintamadas,2011-06-24T16:45Z,Now the Department (B737-200adv) is in the Ministry (FSX&FS9). It was really an herculian task having this completed just becos i want a 737-200adv with VC. DL speed was terrible but my change came (Job 14v14). Will keep this torrent alive as i love this birdie. Remain blessed PopArt!
