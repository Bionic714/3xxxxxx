Could really use some seeders because 5kps... shit aint funny."
,itiswhatitis,2008-06-18T18:13Z,"Download speed overal is great if you are lucky enough to get some seeders. For the last hour or so I have been working with 0-2 seeders and the upload time is just taking too long.

I ppreciate you uploading this video and i also appreciate the few who are acualing seeding and no just leaching.


I am giving up on this download since i havn't changed percentage in the last hour, good luck to whomever can get this file downloaded."
