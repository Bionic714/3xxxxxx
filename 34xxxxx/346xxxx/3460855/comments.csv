,theponyboy,2006-03-22T04:55Z,"One of the best animated films i know.  Beautyful and dark with revolutionary animation. Bluth took a handfull of animators and left Disney, inventing new ways to animate perspective and glowing effects, investing many years and his life savings and did this masterpiece! Truly a classic! Thank you!"
,coasternut,2006-03-22T07:01Z,"Is this by any chance a widescreen version?  The US version is full screen ONLY!

I have a laserdisc version that is widescreen and I would love to replace it.

Thanks for the download"
,ramday,2006-03-22T07:26Z,Anything ripped or compessed? If this is 4:3 is it atleast open matte?

,Sargent_D,2006-03-22T14:17Z,"Sorry gang, it's the US pan and scan version, no Swedish subs. :("
,tvrips,2006-03-24T02:25Z,"Piratrofan: Swesub finns på www.undertexter.se
http://www.undertexter.se/?p=subark&id=4164
i deras forum har de guider hur man lägger sub på dvdr."
,tvrips,2006-03-24T02:25Z,"Kan hända att du får ändra frameraten eller så.
Eller så kan du göra som jag brukar göra.
Rippa den engelska subtitlen ifrån dvdn i rätt framerate, och öppna den svenska subtitlen ifrån www.undertexter.se och kopiera in det svenska över det engelska med programmet ""Subtitle Workshop"" det blir ca 1000st copy & paste men går rätt fort."
,Messerschmitt,2006-04-17T09:37Z,"One of the best animated films most defenetely! I have it, but in full screen as well. One of the most dark movies, and not Disney! So no non-sense music, treated for kids. This is a real, serious animation"

,Kemono,2009-01-23T08:31Z,"""The Secret of NIMH was animated in the 1.33:1 aspect ratio, and matted in theatres to 1.85:1 widescreen."" From the review at the following: http://www.ultimatedisney.com/secretofnimh.html

That said, there is a NTSC version with both the widescreen and fullscreen version along with English, Spanish, and French audio, but I haven't been able to find it as a torrent."
