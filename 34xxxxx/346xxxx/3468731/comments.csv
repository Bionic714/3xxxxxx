,slugga,2006-04-11T22:13Z,"doesnt work. Got CTD's too. delete /gauges/*.*

Slugz"
,duder1,2006-04-11T22:13Z,"I do have planes WITH the GNS530 and the GNS430 installed in them,  now I just gotta figure out what the filename is for both the plane gauges and then filename to the gauges that this product installs, I can then maybe make at least 2 of these items work.  Will let ya'll know."
,duder1,2006-04-11T22:14Z,DO NOT delete ANY gauges in tjhe4 /gauges folder.  Slugga is an idiot!!!
,GeeTI,2006-04-11T23:47Z,Working fine on my system !! ?? UPLOADED A NEW CRACK VERIFIED WORKING WITH THE WX500 GUAGE. :)
,duder1,2006-04-12T00:38Z,"well, then upload the cracked gauge file for the WX500 gauge please."
,toddw,2006-04-12T01:55Z,"Well, these gauges require a legitimate lic to work, the de-wrapper 3.81 just creates a blank lic, but the CMD based de-wrapper (green) works and produces both a working lic and key plus proof of purchase__T.W. ;)"
,fack,2006-04-12T02:07Z,where do you get the CMD based dewrapper?
,slick12,2006-04-12T02:59Z,"http://thepiratebay.org/details.php?id=3459380

Tried with the cmd version, got a license and a proof of purchase this time (instead of just a license using 3.81). Gauges (flt) still won't show up though."
,fack,2006-04-12T03:16Z,"Did the same thing, all I get is the RXP logo where the gauges are... even with the CMD de-wrapper"
,ka992,2006-04-12T09:37Z,dude these crack looks like doesn't work for me eigther what else we can use . 
,ka992,2006-04-12T09:42Z,hey what about someone upload the cracked gauges
,GeeTI,2006-04-12T18:46Z,"I've verified that the WX500 gauge works with the ""cmd.exe"" crack . This crack creates both the .lic file plus the key file.
I've installed to the Flight1 112 Commander and it's working fine.
The revised crack has been uploaded here...

,duder1,2006-04-13T07:06Z,"I can verify the crack works also with the GNS430, GNS530, the SANDEL products, AND the Pro version for the GNS430/GNS530.  It does NOT work on the Flight T product."

,RID2,2010-02-23T07:40Z,"REQ: FSdreamteam KLAS 

Most of these work except the N & T gauges. Look here on the PB for that instead.  I would recommend that you use FS Panel Studio  to install them sense placement is a littile hard editing the config files. although all you do is replace the gauge name.

The N gauge has two gagues that are not named in the config. tool that comes with Reality XP. They are rxpFLN!FDAP

and 
rxpFLT!Dimmer


Read the FLN service manual once installed. These gauges need to be installed somewhere in the cockpit. The dimmer is a knob and the FDAP is a switch. So place in the panel accordingly. "
