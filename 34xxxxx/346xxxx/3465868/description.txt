┬½Ivo i Mara┬╗ - review in Saturday Telegraph  

"...I doubt you'll have heard such things deployed with such a degree of gritty urgency. This music would seem equally relevant to the village wedding or the urban mega-rave, and while I've never been a great one for the album as travel soundtrack, the thought of powering over the Croatian plains with this at full blast certainly gets the neck hairs prickling."
