The birth of an extreme off-road 4x4 Mechanical genius Mark Evans dusts off his overalls and introduces Discovery Home and Leisure and i2i television's latest 'is Born' series 'A 4x4 is Born'. This series transforms an old rust-bucket Range Rover into the ultimate bolder-crawling beauty! The 1985 Range Rover is converted into a one off 100 inch wheelbase hybrid as a tribute to 25 special vehicles that Landrover built for the French and Swiss armies in the late seventies.
In the first episode, Mark cleans off the grime off his donor car & checks the health of the mechanical parts. Meanwhile, in the regular feature, '4x4 Extreme', we see an extreme hybrid V8 car in off-road terrain.
