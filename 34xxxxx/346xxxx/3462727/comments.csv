,Son Of Mogh,2006-03-27T22:03Z,"Yay, thnx a lot man, very fast too this time. Will help seeding. :)"
,Son Of Mogh,2006-03-27T22:05Z,"Oh and it's a good thing you changed the piece-size to 256 kb, think that will make it go faster than 4 mb a piece like the last time. And also a good thing to reduce the extras so the episodes look better. Thnx a lot again!!!"

,hotspice,2006-04-02T12:28Z,uhura: I've learned that the S/L counter on TPB isn't always reliable. There might be seeders although it says none in the counter
,rhebult,2006-04-02T21:48Z,"right now, there is one seeder, and i see over 50 leachers waiting to download the last three %. A bit patience, and you will get it in minutes..."
,uhura,2006-04-02T22:15Z,"Sorry, for my impatience... "
,petsel,2006-04-03T12:16Z,"Its always good to hear that the job I put down to release this series is appreciated that is why I am continuing to release the discs. If it would have been to much BS I would have stoped.
But that is nop the case now It looks like many enjoy the show so I will continue.

I will release the next disc in a few days..."
,hotspice,2006-04-03T17:25Z,"Really looking forward to your next release Petsel! A few days=2 days?  ;-)
Just joking. Take the time you need."
,petsel,2006-04-04T07:21Z,"If you are missing the audio, I cant check that since I have deleted the files, I am sorry for that not my intention to delete them..."
