,Gaggarin,2006-04-11T23:18Z,"hey global, how do you boot this from the hdd? I tried putting the whole dvd on the hd, but all I get is a black screen. I heard that you're supposed to put in the elfs, but how do you do that?"
,juggz143,2006-04-12T17:37Z,"I swear people are so obnoxious, If you are on here downloading games then 9 times outta 10 you have an exploit, mod or already know how to swap. Thanks for the upload."
,Gaggarin,2006-04-12T18:50Z,"well accually, I always put my games on hd. I've just imported kingdom hearts 2, which don't work on hd, and also won't work with swap magic 3.3, at least not on my PS2. So I thought I was gonna try this one since I don't won't to spend any cash just to get the upgraded version of something I've already purchased. Also I don't have a burner at the moment, ergo, I need to know if you can get swap magic 3.6 to work off of hd."
,globalwar,2006-04-12T23:36Z,"Gaggarin:
Sorry, i was wrong about it working on HD. Someone told me it worked on HD, so i just assumed it did. I tested it myself today (using USBAdvance) and they freeze after the splash screen. 
Sorry if i caused you or anyone else any probelms!"

,TheBike,2006-12-25T04:00Z,"Har ni inga bevis så skippa alla dessa onödiga kommentarer. Börjar bli ett enormt överflöd av sådana här på TPB.
Jag har ett förslag. Dock icke testat. Det finns program som ställer in booktype till DVD-ROM eller CD-ROM istället för DVD-r eller dyl. Skulle inte det kunna göra tricket? Om det inte är ett importerat spel så kan man ju även bränna själva spelet i formatet DVD-ROM.
Om någon kan konfirmera att detta fungerar så skulle det göra mig glad! Ska själv testa så fort det går :)

,jennysalala,2006-12-28T01:06Z,"You guys are all idiots. If you go to forums you'd have a much better understanding.

1. Swap Magic copy works as long as you have a chip or another boot method.

2. Cogswap is 10x better that SM.

3. It works on HDD. It doesn't work for you whiners cause you're idiots and don't know how to change the boot file. You need to change the SYSTEM.CNF.

4. Game copies don't work because of something called the ""Yaroze Key""

5. 210MB compressed to 2.2 is nothing. Search HD Advance 2.0 on this site (uploaded by me) and you'll see I compressed a little over 5gigs to just 4MB.

6. YES THIS WORKS WITH A SPECIAL BOOT METHOD. It's quite pointless if you have a modchip.

,mikeysnip,2007-02-23T05:49Z,"Ok i hope everyone reads this one post, THIS is the point of this torrent.. for all of those people who OWN a older version of swapmagic, the older version will not run newer games.. so if you download this image file.. and burn it then you can use your old swapmagic cd to run this newer version to run newer games... that way you dont have to buy the new swapmagic.. 

 This will NOT work if you dont use something like a REAL copy of swapmagic.. dont waste your time downloading this unless own a real copy.. 

 and jennysalala ur a idiot.. you dont even realize the point of this torrent lol, most people dont wanna go through the trouble.. if they already own a freekin swapmagic cd.. they can just burn this (for free) and then RUN there new games.. 

 IDIOT lol.."

,schlangman,2007-09-16T08:20Z,"The CD version works, because I booted my PS2 with an older SwapMagic 3.3 CD, but the DVD version appears to be either corrupted or totally messed up, because when I boot with my SwapMagic 3.3 DVD and pop in the burned 3.6 DVD, it reports it as a non PS2 disc.  I'll try reburning it at a slower speed, such as 2.4x, as the previous one was burned at 8x, but I have my doubts that will work.  I'm still convinced that the DVD ISO file is crap."

install the magic keys and load the swap magic, wait til the dvd program loads, and the dcd stops in the ps2 player. 

then take out the dvd swap magic, and then insert a burned ps2 game :) 
and then push X button, and the game start running ;) "

,twinrush,2008-02-10T13:06Z,this only good if you have an old version of swapmagic  that dont load newer games. so use the old swap magic to load the new one then the game and ofcourse you dont need it if your ps2 has a modchip

,Zerosuke,2009-01-13T21:42Z,lideadhead and for others that don't know you got a pink border on your screen because you didn't use a slide card. With swap magic you can't eject the disk after it boots or the game won't work. You use the slide card to slide the disk lock to the right from under the disk tray and pull it out without pressing the eject button. Put the game in and slide the card from the left. Press X and start the game. You should have a blue outline on your screen. 
,tripper511,2009-03-04T03:38Z,"From what I understand swap magic works because the ps2 reads it and thinks its a game disc.  Once it passes the ""disc check"" you slide in a burned game and it will read it since swap magic prevented the ps2 from recognizing that is a copy.  but the catch is that you have to swap the disc with out the ps2 realizing that you open the disc drive."
,Project_Spam,2009-04-01T04:44Z,"Heres a link on how to make your own slide card

I have NOT dl or tried this, still 218 Dist when I read this.

As I understand a PS2 Disc is done / burned with special burners, these burners are able to write a 0 value checksum of the game or something as I understand it no normal computer burners are able to do this thus any ""perfectly"" made copy of an PS2 game will ""fail"". AND as this is a ""Copy"" of a real PS2 null checksumed bootup a copy (as this is) ""should"" theoretically ""fail""...
