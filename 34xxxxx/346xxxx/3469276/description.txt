This torrent contains 92 5 megapixel images from the April 10 immigrant march on Washington, DC in the United States. I am releasing them into the public domain so that independent journalists around the world have a source of hi-res images of this event. All photos are unedited and unretouched - I just got back from the March and haven't had time to do anything with them yet.
