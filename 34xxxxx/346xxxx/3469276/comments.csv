,Sargent_D,2006-04-11T01:52Z,"Illegal immigrants have no right to stay in the U.S., that's why they're called illegal. All these Mexicans screaming about how they have every right to stay here make me sick. They have NO right to be here! I think maybe it's time our immigration department reminds them of that fact."
,reddove,2006-04-11T03:32Z,"Racist bastards! They are illegal because YOU call them illegal, if you are concerned about legality then piss off and give the land back to the native americans."

,reddove,2006-04-12T03:05Z,"CharlesMartell - Whats the matter? Cant take the truth so want to shut me up? ""the 5th column inside our civilization"" that description of immigrants alone disqualifies you from the human race."
,CharlesMartell,2006-04-12T04:20Z,"Hehe shutting you up would be counter productive, far from it keep talking. The more of your kind that rear their ugly heads the easier it is to get legislation trough to save our civilization, from decline and in the end its fall.
