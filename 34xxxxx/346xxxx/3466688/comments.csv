,MaXiMiUS,2006-04-05T03:46Z,"Or use the original link.

http://www.files.bz/files/3987/SetsunaHorseArmorMod.zip

All credits go to Setsuna, for giving it away :)"
,Luckmann,2006-04-05T04:09Z,"I think they'll recognize my name on the official forums. I'm already banned, though, because of a huge missunderstanding a couple of days ago. ;)"
,MageThief,2006-04-05T04:32Z,"NICE,,,,,,,,,
Might anyone have the other 2 official mods?"
,Luckmann,2006-04-05T04:33Z,"Well, I think they've got some dude sitting with a itchy-finga'-trigga-nigga right now, checking newly registered accounts for my IP and banning them as I create them.

Most likely, the mods doesn't have the rights to permanently ban a IP-address. I'm busted for tonight. I'm going to entrust you, my loyal minions, to carry out the word! :D"
,MaXiMiUS,2006-04-05T04:38Z,"""NICE,,,,,,,,,

Might anyone have the other 2 official mods?
""

They arn't even released yet.

Can't you people read? ""Coming Soon""

XD"
,Luckmann,2006-04-05T04:39Z,"Also, MageThief, the other two mods aren't released yet. I got this 'release' by chance; Setsuna uploaded it to the link MaXiMiUS posted.

Once they're released, I'll hopefully get my hands on them and upload them. If I don't, someone else will. Everything ends up on TPB. ;)"
,Luckmann,2006-04-05T04:41Z,"Awww.. were you allowed to stay on the forums, MaX? They banned me.. and about 14 other accounts.. they've already banned at least 6 or so before.
Of my accounts, that is. ;)"
,AssassinX2005,2006-04-05T04:47Z,"Anyone have an account at GAMEFAQS? I am to chicken to post this link at that site! Heres the forum to post it at:
http://boards.gamefaqs.com/gfaqs/gentopic.php?board=924363"
,AssassinX2005,2006-04-05T04:49Z,":Adds up total:
This game cost me:
+$1.99 Horse Armor
-$1.99 Horse Armor  Download on Pirate Bay
-------
  $0.00 Total

Woohoo!"
,melonadejello,2006-04-05T05:23Z,Can anyone enlighten my illiterate ass to get the .esp to recognize the files in the .bsa?
,Luckmann,2006-04-05T05:33Z,"AssassinX2005, I tried, but it keeps getting moderated and deleted. ;) I think they're going to block my account in a while if I keep going. We'll see.

Melonadejello, it's possible they go into different folders. I'm going to check it out in a while. It's getting late here, though, and I should probobly sleep. :p"
,Ranam,2006-04-05T05:49Z,"I saw the link on GameFaqs, Luckmann. Thanks. :D"
,Luckmann,2006-04-05T05:53Z,"Np, Ranam. Do me a favor and spread the word and that'll be thanks enough. To charge for a mod that adds horse-armor.. Sighface.
It's all because of Microsoft and Xbox. They would have had a heartattack if PC-users got mods for free, but not Xboxers, and Microsoft would never distribute it for free over XBox-live."
,Karras,2006-04-05T07:44Z,"Many thanks to you, Luckmann!!!"
,Darkdashing,2006-04-05T08:25Z,"Power to the people, F U Zenimax, don't you have enough money? Btw, I was banned to on one of my accounts too :)"
,Luckmann,2006-04-05T08:40Z,"I've been banned more times than I can count now. I was banned several times a couple of days ago, then I've been banned at least 20 times today, counting the auto-bans before I changed to proxy. Then I went unmolested for about 1h, then not a ban, just an inability to post.. "
,Luckmann,2006-04-05T08:40Z,"I JUST got banned again, for posting piracy link. But it's not a permanent one! :O It's ""Your account has been temporarily suspended. This suspension is due to end on Aug 20 2033, 07:36 AM."" Yay! xD"
,Luckmann,2006-04-05T08:42Z,"They just got back from their supposed coffee-break. There's mass deletion, purging and bannings going on atm. We went unmolested for over 1.5 hours, well above that.. Counting different distribution centers (I know at least 6 different places where it's hosted now) we're talking well over 2000 downloads just these last hours. Anyway, it's late in sweden (08:41 AM) and I'll sleep. I'll keep seeding."
,Darkdashing,2006-04-05T09:52Z,"hehe, funny this happened, but entertaining. I upped your torrent intact to some other sites too with the readme in place"
,Luckmann,2006-04-05T10:10Z,"No problemo. In fact, I appreciate it. As long as as many people get it for free instead of the two dollar Bethesda is trying to peddle it for, I'm happy. :)"
,Darkdashing,2006-04-05T10:41Z,you must enable it first in the 'data files' section in the launcher
[T],Knaster,2006-04-05T10:51Z,Ah thx darkdasher i forgot that lol
,tehbobb,2006-04-05T10:53Z,thx for the mod man ;)
,Luckmann,2006-04-05T11:02Z,"I'm getting a bunch of thanks here. I simply uploaded it on TPB. All thanks should be directed at a dude named Setsuna that hosted it on http://www.files.bz in the first place, and dared to post it on the official forums.

It's been anarchy since that, and it's popping up everywhere. I made it a torrent because torrents can't be taken down. :)"
,Darkdashing,2006-04-05T11:23Z,"torrents can be taken down if reported, but not usually from here, luckily."
,NecroBeator,2006-04-05T12:06Z,Fucking Aye...
,Gosu_no_Koroshiya,2006-04-05T13:52Z,Thanks alot! ^_^
,Baleurion,2006-04-05T14:01Z,"Thx, bought the game once, and if we get patches for free (like we should), and mods for free, an official mod should also be free. Forget that i'm paying for a friggen mod! :)
An expansion pack is just on the border of worth-the-money, but anything less than an expansion pack can't be charged money for imo."
,Stardaemon,2006-04-05T14:41Z,"1) Much appreciated:)
2) Luckmann, ever thought of using proxies?:) ofc, if you've go a dynamic ip, it's really not an issue..."
,The Raven,2006-04-05T17:04Z,what do i do with these files?
,_Kat_,2006-04-05T17:04Z,Thanks a lot man! :-D Keep spreading this tiny little file!!
,Karras,2006-04-05T17:46Z,Place both files in the Data folder.
[V],SCORPION2000,2006-04-05T17:51Z,Thanks alot! :D
,smoketwojoints,2006-04-05T18:19Z,"Awesome work, I can imagine this would be a blow for their sales of the mod. Just need someone to torrent the patch when it come out so we don't have to buy that too hahah :D"
,DJ-Natron,2006-04-05T19:12Z,"hi! thx for the uppload! it's just when i've extracted the files into ""data folder"" where can i buy one? or do it just appear on all the horses? plz help"
,Gnaar_,2006-04-05T21:01Z,WHAT DOES IT DO?
,Sh4d0w,2006-04-05T21:48Z,"Gnaar: It adds armour for the horses.
Thanks for the upload, i think bethesda went a bit to far with taking charge for plugins! I bought the CE edition and i think plugins and such should be free like for morrowind."
,Igziabeher,2006-04-05T23:36Z,"absurd. fucking absurd. that those hacks at bethesda would charge for this is insane. its more akin to a patch than a mod. since it adds something that should have been included.

i was gonna buy this game, after dling it, but now ive reconisdered.

fuck bethesda, all my gaming dollers goes to valve"
,BadIronTree,2006-04-05T23:46Z,"http://users.otenet.gr/~badiron/lolob.JPG
ahahahahhaha
people posted in the official oblivion forums like 3-4 time a ZIP file
that have been downloaded 5000+ times with the 2 files about this horces armor official plug-in

it was 30 minites there
people filed 3 pages until a mod showed up and delete

Dont PM me about the link...."
,Fratyinside,2006-04-06T00:36Z,Awesome I was looking for this. Why the fuck make us pay for some shitty horse armor.
,b00lean,2006-04-06T01:04Z,"Tack för den här! ^_^
Som om jag skulle betala 2 USD för någon sketen hästrusting. :P Hoppas Bethesda lär sig något av det här."
,Rich8511,2006-04-06T04:33Z,"Thanks for the torrent! I agree with everyone here.. I bought the game, but it is ridiculous to charge us for something as small as this. Amen for torrents and kind people like you and the Setsuna guy who posted it."
,Luckmann,2006-04-06T05:14Z,"DarkDashing, I know, but this is TPB. It's technically -possible- to take down the link to the torrent from TPB, but it won't happen. ;)"
,Luckmann,2006-04-06T05:17Z,"Stardaemon, you mentioned proxies. I'm using a proxy right now just to be able to watch the official boards. Not only did they ban my account and my ability to create accounts with my IP, but I can't even lurk anymore. Proxy ftw. :)"
,Luckmann,2006-04-06T05:17Z,Badirontree.. that link is further up in the comments.. who do you think was one of the ones that posted the link on the official forums? ;) It was anarchy there yesterday. :)
,popeslayer,2006-04-06T05:45Z,i hope the lamers over at bethesda who decided to  ask money for this mod get run over by a truck. lets see if their shitty 2 dollar armor helps them then.
,Luckmann,2006-04-06T06:46Z,I believe it was Microsoft that pushed for it. It's all because of Microsoft and the Xbox360.
,popeslayer,2006-04-06T07:18Z,anyone who cooperates with microshits evil schemes deserves to die too :p
,Luckmann,2006-04-06T15:48Z,"All you have to do is extract the files to the /data folder, start up Oblivion, click ""Data Files"" on the launcher to check that the mod is started, and then play.

If it's anything else, it has nothing to do with this mod and I can't help you."
,arszenik,2006-04-06T22:20Z,excellent torrent; great job man!
,arszenik,2006-04-06T22:20Z,it works graet
,Luckmann,2006-04-07T04:56Z,"Veertje, it sounds like you don't have a proper install. As if you just ripped the installed directory straight from someone else instead of installing it.
Usually, you have to install a game for the game launcher to work (properly)"
,nikoltjev,2006-04-07T14:11Z,"Thanks luckmann, I'm with you on your battle against having to pay for mods!"
[V],BlueD,2006-04-07T17:53Z,Great! I can't believe they actually want us to pay for a mod.
,poodle_sniffer,2006-04-08T01:44Z,"god you guys are GREAT!  *hugs*
sometimes i think TPB is the last bastion of Freedom in this world."
,theyarecomingforyou,2006-04-08T07:54Z,"Cheers, this works great. I didn't need to mess about with the launcher or anything, I just copied the files ito the Data folder and loaded up the game and I had a new message telling me to head to the stables... I headed there and got a choice which armour I wanted, saying that I could then buy in other stables should I choose. However, I'm slightly weary about using this release because if they decide to clamp down on it in future addons or patches I'll have to redo all my work... I backup my saves regularly as it is and I'm still hesitant.

I'm happy to support Bethesda if they release decent content for a reasonable price (like the upcoming addons), just not for trivial crap like this."
,Luckmann,2006-04-08T14:15Z,"Well, Theyarecomingforyou (lol), this is just like any other mod, and they can't really do anything about it. Worst case scenario is that you'll just stop using the mod and I can guarentee you that everything will be back to normal once you do.. except that your horse will be gone.. :) (it's not clothes for the horse. It's actually a all-new model that replaces your horse)"
,Vecna,2006-04-08T17:55Z,"If you think about it Oblivion is just a crappy rip of Morrowind, the content sucks BUT they have stunning graphic, cooool!

They make us pay full price for a incomplete game. Look on the planned add-ons and tell me if that wasn't already in Morrowind at launch.

I even got reports that horse armour was ""planned"" from start way back but obviously they took that out so they could SELL the shit later. Damn idiots, seed this shit to as many as you can, im not accepting this bullshit of a sequel..."
,Luckmann,2006-04-08T18:06Z,"That's right, Vecna. The armored horses starred in many beta-images prior to the launch of the game. They were purposly taken out of the game so they could sell it seperatly later."
,Ebeeto,2006-04-09T02:23Z,"Charging for simple mods. It's probably Microsoft's idea. A shame... A shame... Aw, capitalism..."
,Cold71,2006-04-09T06:23Z,"quick question, does this just add armor on all the horses, or do you buy it from some shop keep and equip it to your horse? thanks"
,nikoltjev,2006-04-09T14:01Z,You get it free (in-game) the first time. For every other horse you have to pay 500 gold.
,ArseholeMuppet,2006-04-10T13:59Z,"thnx very much BadIronTree and Luckmann..

Im more than familiar with the TES forums but missed the urls

here i am tho thanking u profusely and seeding this little tasty

lets hope we can get the imperial orrery and all the other mods as easily

thanks again guys

;)"
,Luckmann,2006-04-10T17:02Z,"The other mods WILL reach us, unless Bethesda does something radical in the way they distribute the mods and how they work. I -will- get it and I -will- put it up as a torrent unless someone else does. :)"
[V],Zirex,2006-04-11T01:17Z,Luckmann: Thank you. A big thanks.
,Onlinemerc,2006-04-13T23:17Z,"Just want to ask the creator of this torrent:
1- the official mod is 6.0 mb in size while this is 3.7, is this because it's compressed?
2- Will it work with cracked versions of oblivion?
3- You will make torrents of the upcoming orrery and wizard's tower official mods and any future mods?"
,Luckmann,2006-04-14T21:49Z,All answered further up. It's basicly 1) Kinda. 2) Yes. 3) Yes.
,Darkdashing,2006-04-18T08:44Z,hopefully someone will up the new mods ;)
,mattmoto,2006-04-19T00:51Z,"Yeah, the orrery mod is out. I am killing time trying out user-made mods, while waiting for someone to put up the orrery for download."
,Luckmann,2006-04-21T15:39Z,"Yeah sorry,  I totally missed the Orrery mod, I've been.. absent. It's up at http://thepiratebay.org/details.php?id=3472789"
,ZeZniC,2006-04-25T14:03Z,Can somebody please now upload the Wizard's Tower mod that was released yesterday? :)
,andreas2244,2008-10-20T22:08Z,im downloading your torrent and hope its working beacuse its had been so cool whit horse armour
,dadam1,2009-02-27T05:17Z,1 seeder :(
,kdog111,2009-04-04T09:23Z,SEEED PEOPLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
,patdafireman,2011-07-23T05:38Z,"I keep downloading the torrent, but when i go in bittorrent, it never enven starts downloading? wtf"
