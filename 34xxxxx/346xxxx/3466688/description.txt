This is my first torrent ever uploaded, so I hope this works.

This is the official mod for Oblivion that Bethesda is trying to peddle for 1.99 USD each. Thanks to a couple of people ON THE OFFICIAL FORUMS the mod is now available here, on TPB.

It's just like any other mod. The original .exe that you download from Bethesda requires a activation code, but it's just self-extracting these files.

So enjoy.
