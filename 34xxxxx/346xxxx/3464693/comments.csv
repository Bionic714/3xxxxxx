,Lobaloba,2006-04-01T01:30Z,Who the fuck put this together? A lot of great songs but the compilation in all is lousy... The Doors at number 6 its just booooooring.... Long live rock n´roll.
,TheIronMan,2006-04-01T13:08Z,"Could someone please seed?
Thanks in advance!"

Elton John is in this ""Rock an roll""... But where are the Metallica songs =/?!"
,DJDrav,2006-04-02T20:14Z,"Metallica are not rock. They're heavy metal, or at the very least, heavy rock. Elton John was a rocker before he turned. Besides, what are you moaning for? it's not as if you have paid good money for it. Don't like? Create your own and do better.

Roll on!"
,starofthesea,2006-04-04T02:17Z,"FYI, the list is from Rolling Stone."

,artsupreme,2006-04-08T18:28Z,"Question from a newbie:

What's conisdered a fast download speed?  Mine averages about 75 kB/s.  Is this considered average, slow, fast?

If slow, is there anyway to speed things up?

Thanks"
,pantyhacker,2006-04-08T19:07Z,"depends on a few things.
your connection for starters
i am on 5Mb cable and i am downloading this torrent @ around 122KB/sec.

,Hurtige,2006-04-09T11:51Z,"Great stuff.. Stop hating guys, everybody has different music taste. But this is surely a must have for every rock fan. I would surely not have made the list like this.. But there is more than 200 songs that would be on my list and thanks alot misterwayn for putting them all in one place.."
,DeeDoo3,2006-04-09T18:31Z,"Good torrent ^^, lots of Pink Floyd n other great groups."

,The Hatebreeder,2006-04-12T14:47Z,"Jesus fucking christ.
There is NO heavy songs on this fucking list.
Add some fucking heavy metal.
At least some songs with an actual guitar solo.
Stairway to Heaven suck ass compared to Metallica's One, Fade to Black, Creeping Death, Ride the Lightning, Welcome Home (Sanitarium), and Jump in the Fire.
Oh, and who the fuck downloads music anyways?
If you're a true fan, go fucking buy the records yourself.
Damn jabroni ass motherfuckers."

,pacman90,2006-04-13T14:45Z,how could you poseblt claim that santana is a rock n roll artist 
,Tokgalningen,2006-04-13T21:08Z,Maybe because he is (or rather was) a rock n' roll artist. In the 60's that is.. I think he played at woodstock to..
,weedman123,2006-04-14T05:22Z,guys who want metal on this list already have it in Queen and Led Zepplin AND BLACK SABBATH is on there so you metal fans shut the hell up this is an awesome list. Queend Zeppelin and Sabbath are all contributers to metal so shut the hell up and stop complaining. and for the guy who said metallica is better than zeppelin you are dumb. I am a metallica fan so dont think I am biased in any way but Zeppelin IS better. So all the Complainers out there dont DL this list but there is traces of metal here and there in this list. great upload misterwayn.

,Metonomy,2006-04-23T08:29Z,"Rock and roll is a genre of music that emerged as a defined musical style in the Southern United States in the 1950s, and quickly spread to the rest of the country, and the world. It later evolved into the various sub-genres of what is now called simply 'rock'. As a result, ""rock and roll"" now has two distinct meanings: either traditional rock and roll in the 1950s style, or later rock and even pop music which may be very far from traditional rock and roll. (wikipedia)"

(Encylopedia Britannica)"
,Metonomy,2006-04-23T08:49Z,"Hi friends. I looked at some songs and thought: ""What? This is not rock and roll. This is not even rock!"" Then I checked out Encyclopedia Britannica, Encarta and Wikipedia, etc, and I came to the understanding that my definition of rock and roll was more close to ""traditional"" rock & roll.

And Rolling Stones-Sympathy for the Devil has skips, I am not sure of any other flubs, but I keep listening to the list waiting for them. Could somebody do an addendum with corrections? If I could find the tunes, and had a full list of songs that needed to be replaced I'd do it myself. In fact if people wanted to send me an email with the names of songs they don't think sound right, I might try and put out a redo of them. wickedprince@whitefoxden.net I am sorry, I only speak English, so please write me in English.

,Spherez,2008-04-20T07:03Z,"@Aidith:

If you're going to call any song with an electric guitar produced after 1980 'emo shit,' you have no right whatsoever to be telling anyone to ""learn your damn music."" 

Emo music is emo. That's the genre. Alt rock is stuff like the Matches, newer stuff with a good beat and simple harmonies. Hard rock has been around since the 70s - ever heard of Guns N' Roses? Maybe KISS? 

Jackass. Get your head out of your ass and learn something before you come hating on modern music because you haven't bothered listening to more than 3 new songs since the Cold War ended."
,RainbowDissent,2008-04-22T10:46Z,"great collection, but for those who care about these things, none of these songs are tagged properly. artist is always ""various""."
,skuzzmeister,2008-04-26T06:20Z,"Spherez, if any of the ""modern"" music you refer to was any good, maybe I would listen to it.  As far as I'm concerned, all this emo shit isn't worth wiping my ass with.  There hasn't been anything recorded since the cold war that's worth listening to.  Go cut yourself, you self-righteous, entitled asshole."

,nwoonet,2009-01-15T19:00Z,"hi guys, im having a problem adding these songs to itunes - when i added the songs, they were in the various artists category, and the name of the artists was in the song title (e.g. ""001 - Led Zeppelin - Stairway To Heaven"" was a song name and there was no artist). is there any way to fix this problem? sorry im still a nub at using itunes."
,greene1911,2009-01-20T06:31Z,"i spoke to soon... dont download this crap unless you want to rename every single song individually, the artist is named various artists for every single one, piece o shit..."
,MmmmSteak,2009-03-09T00:06Z,"Great content


HORRIBLE. FUCKING TAGS.

Everything is Various Artists, the file names are numbered for NO fucking REASON.

I'm spending half of my day renaming and re-tagging the half of this I downloaded. Fucking BULLSHIT to whoever the dumbfuck was who encoded and named this travesty."
,eblan932,2009-04-04T00:28Z,Please seeeeeddd! This is taking all day...literally.
,welchini,2009-05-18T08:06Z,"Hey thanks to  MmmmSteak at 2009-03-09 
for his comment on the tags

Great content
HORRIBLE. FUCKING TAGS.
' half of my day renaming and re-tagging'

It happens to me and I hate it   PLEASE dont share indiscriminately FIX YOUR TAGS!  Thanks for some of the songs too."
,LimparxX,2009-06-05T17:40Z,Thx for this :)
,northe,2009-06-28T00:39Z,"God, these tags are FRIKKIN annoying me. Holy crap. But I'm a little more than half-way done, and the trick is to search the artist(say, The Beatles) in the search, select them all, get info, and change the artist name. It also helps to group them together and make them less discouraging. "
,northe,2009-06-28T00:44Z,"I read some of the earlier comments, and for the tags(though it's a little late for me) you can download an ""mp3 tag editor"". Dunno."
,northe,2009-06-28T01:03Z,"For Mac Users:

Use TriTip! It's great! Drag all 500 songs into the window, then type:

%n - %a - %(whatever it says the letter is for track title)

Click Apply, then it's done! Drag the 500 songs from the finder to iTunes, and ta-da! :)"

,GypsyRoads,2010-02-03T10:44Z,"Hey I downloaded this list a while back and finally got around to cleaning it up.

there were quite a few misnamed songs
119 doesnt even play.

Broken, loud noise at the begining and random white noise in the background for 16 minutes."
,Darktangent10,2010-04-19T03:09Z,"It's a top 500 list...why the fuck wouldn't it be numbered?

Would have been nice if the artist was in the tags and not the title, for easy searching, but hey."
,Cuzzz,2010-05-10T09:07Z,"You guys whining about bad tags, ever heard of MusicBrainz Picard??  Guess not...it automagically re-tags mp3z...and most other audio file formats...by using the ""audio fingerprints"" of the music files, correctly identifying multiple files in a matter of seconds....and it's free.       "
,knigiit,2010-10-10T18:40Z,"Very nice list.. Happy to see Rush, Yes and Kansas in there, although I think Led Zeppelin's Since I've Been Loving You is an awefull miss in there..

Other than that, REALLY NICE list you got there, cheers!"
,hurf123,2010-12-30T04:34Z,"I think there's something terribly wrong with Sweet Emotion by Aerosmith, it sounds like fucking satan is speaking to me through my speakers"
,Armorus,2011-01-07T14:42Z,"should have been named ""500 out of 1000""
good tracklist but a hack job, besides, no Def Leppard, Elvis or Chuck Berry, or any 50s for that matter. overall the person doesnt appear to know the full extent of rock & roll I guess
almost no hard rock either (GnR, Metallica, Motorhead...)"
,Straydog1st,2011-03-19T05:49Z,"Excellent !!!
I had it over a year ago, I lost it, and I'm back for get it again.
