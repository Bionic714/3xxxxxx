,ramday,2006-03-24T18:54Z,Please oh please seed this! I would give my left nut to see it. I'd give my right along with it for side A of this DVD
,mrbridger,2006-03-25T10:09Z,Side 1 is just the movie and the newer release without the original ending has better picture quality

This has made my week.  ^_^"
,Me2YoU20043,2006-07-22T17:20Z,"I'd be grateful if mrbridger or anyone else could reseed this torrent.

Thank you."
,ZBeeblebrox,2006-07-27T17:07Z,"I'd be really grateful if someone could reseed this torrent as many of us are stuck at around 85% and only have 400MB to go.

Thank you."
,tw332,2006-11-18T11:55Z,"Wow, I lost count how long I was downloading this torrent.  By the time it came thru i guess i must've had a ratio of 250:1.... lol

Very nice torrent... Well worth the wait. 

I'll seed it for a while :)"
,ChickenEater,2009-08-17T08:46Z,"Just finished downloading this after about a week of trying. Played it back and...

This is Side B of the widely available DVD release. It contains none of the recalled extras as described in the torrent description.

I find this incredibly disappointing as I was keenly looking for a straight rip of the recalled disc (chiefly to watch the original ending, which I was fortunate enough to see once, 23 years ago), but this definitely is not it."
,FluxCapacitor,2009-08-27T20:42Z,"Wrong ChickenEater.  The original ending is on this disk, and it is one of the recalled ""extras"".  But it is in black and white."
,ChickenEater,2009-08-29T23:21Z,"Yep, having downloaded again, I've found the original ending.

A thousand apologies for discouraging anyone from this excellent upload."
,ldmlfam,2012-05-30T01:56Z,"Seed me...!
Seed me Seymor!

I'm stuck at 92,8%...
Please, I've always wanted to have this! Somebody please seed some more..."
