Enjoy.
Kinowi."
,Kinowi,2006-04-01T10:53Z,"Once again, thepiratebay tracker is not available... This tracker has so many people, that its tracking ability is not that good anymore... Please, use DHT network, or other trackers...

This is where i post my torrents, and will update you with news etc, but as a tracker.... :(

Kinowi"
,Kinowi,2006-04-02T11:54Z,"What would you do if i was saying ""Hey, Lost 1st Season DVD Rip was just a 1st April joke, hu hu hu""?
Just kidding :P"
,Tucker99,2006-04-08T13:52Z,"Is anyone else going to seed this???

Swarm has plenty of you with full copy.. you are the reason that new users get a bad impression and think it's ok to leech without sharing!"
,Kinowi,2006-05-24T21:12Z,"""Swarm has plenty of you with full copy.. you are the reason that new users get a bad impression and think it's ok to leech without sharing!""
Pitty you think that. I have already seeded more than 15% (mostly to DHT Netowork). I dont get why you complain. As i said, USE DHT. TBP Tracker is most of the time unreachable.

I will seed it to the end. If you want to download it, if not, dont attack on me for not uploading - cause i am!"
,nerrad,2006-06-26T13:13Z,"Please seed people you have been given the privilege to download it the least you can do is seed and stop being selfish this is a large file we need as many seeders as possible.

And Thanks Kinowi a great torrent"
,an2ny79,2006-10-01T07:30Z,"I haven't fully downloaded this yet... as of this writing, download progress is slow (40% for 2 weeks)... downloading stopped but I'll still leave my torrent open for other...

Anyway, just want to give my thanks for this share, even if I don't know if I would successfully download this huge torrent."
,Kinowi,2006-10-20T05:26Z,"i do my best :)

I will not stop seeding this torrent... After all, when i am done with this, i will seed 2nd Period ;).

So dont worry about this torrent. Just leave your client seeding it so you have the file faster... That way i will only upload new parts not available and NOT the same ones other people have ;)

,mullhippiar,2006-11-11T15:55Z,"49 GB???? Thats gonna fill my entire Hard Drive!
... I mean...Uh..My small hard drive, hehe.
I have a Large one too ^^
OKAY OKAY I HAVE A LOUSY COMPUTER

:)"
[T],FaeGiN,2006-11-30T13:18Z,"Wow.  I am totally amazed at the work you have put into this project kinowi.  Also it seems at first to only have one seeder on it...after all this time. Maybe because it is so late with this torrent or is it that everyone who downloaded has gone and it is still you that is seeding?
Anyway, whoever it is, thank you and long may you stay seeding! Hehe. I will too. The largest torrent I downloaded was 10Gb once and that took a while but I got it all.  I am curious if this one will be possible...
I must try at least, my PC is on constantly anyway so nothing to lose and everything to gain!
THANKS!"
,Kinowi,2006-12-07T23:05Z,:) thnx... :D
,sterioskull,2007-01-05T23:18Z,who uploads a torrent thats 40 gig? what a knob...
[T],kef71,2007-01-19T14:17Z,"Today it is 296 since this torrent was created. Currently 75% is finished, which means about 37 GB (49.37  * 0.75) has been uploaded. Now, if we take those 37 gigs and divide them with the number of days this torrent has been active (296) we get that you've been seeding about 0.125 GB or 128 MB per day.  Since there are 86400 seconds (24h * 60m * 60s) per day we can quickly calculate that you are seeding with about 1.51 kB/s (128MB * 1024 / 86400) which I must say would be a new world record when it comes to slow seeding. 1.51 kB/s for heavens sake! For a 50 GB torrent!!!

How about putting some effort into finishing this upload? Or do we really have to wait for another ~100 days for it to finish???"
[T],FaeGiN,2007-02-06T18:17Z,Wow we have a mathematician and an arrogant twat at that.  Just fuck off if you have no good words to say here.
[T],kef71,2007-02-08T13:39Z,"Oh, I can do so much better than that. I got tired of waiting for this amateur upload to finish, so I downloaded both seasons in about a week using the provided links.

Cheers!

,Kinowi,2007-04-21T16:37Z,"HAHAHA i have uploaded 492GBs for this torrent!!!!

I cant believe  some people... Do you have me for some guy who just makes fun of torrent technology? Have you ever download something from me, and wasn't working, or took more than days to complete (not DVDs)?

Anyway, seeding is completed, as more than 50 people have finished downloading this, although not many care to seed..."
