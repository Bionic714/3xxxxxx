,ballah,2006-03-28T01:02Z,Just hope there will be a season 5.. hmm so what are they gonna call that then?.. never ending season misnaming
,baxu,2006-03-28T04:09Z,Remember that FOX has different naming for its TV show and DVD edition so don't be sad. 
,Steeler,2006-03-28T18:56Z,"where can I find S05 E 10 ???
or is there a misspelling as usual..on E 11 ??"
,oblat,2006-03-28T22:11Z,Peter's Done It! was never aired of some reason. Therefor the gap between E10 and E12.
,Girfanir,2006-03-28T23:26Z,Is there anyway to get hold of that episode anyway?
,Morlok8k,2006-04-06T05:02Z,"""Peter's Done It!"" hasnt been aired yet - will it ever?   and thats supposed to be eps. 510.  i think that Team LOL is stupid for skipping the numbers and causing confusion - they shoud be numbered in the order they are aired (or on the DVD - but that doesnt apply yet.) and they should put the production number on the release name or NFO as well.

also quit your bitching about what season it is.  Team LOL releases these, so its their desision to decide what season it is.  there was a long gap between shows (about a half-season) so it makes sense either way."
,hodhanshi,2006-04-07T14:43Z,"Just put the damn episode name in the torrent/filename, then everyone'll be happy."
,zaphod270,2006-04-12T15:48Z,"Of course the missing episode will got shown, with a big ""too shocking for Tv"" tag i'd wager."
[V],dabi,2006-04-13T23:41Z,"Hmm, a description of the episode would help a lot... btw.. nice nfo ;)"
