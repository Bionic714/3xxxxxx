 The Stooges work at Dimsel's Drug Store where they befriend Schuyler, the owner of the shop next door, who is attempting to build a time machine. With the boys "help", the machine transports the boys, Schuyler and wannabe girlfriend Diane back in time to ancient Greece during the reign of the lecherous King Odious. The King has a yearning for Diane and banishes Schuyler and the boys to the galleys, where Schuyler builds impressive muscles while constantly rowing. After escaping, they start billing Schuyler as Hercules at a local gladiatoral arena. The real Hercules gets wind of their game and confronts them, but the Stooges manage to convince Hercules to help them rescue Diane. The time travelers manage to set history straight by removing the King and dump him off during Indian dominated America where a band of warriors chase him off into the distance.
