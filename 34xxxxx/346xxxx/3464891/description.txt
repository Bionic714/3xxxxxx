Championship Fighting by Jack Dempsey (1950)

Considered by some people to be the BEST BOXING MANUAL EVER WRITTEN by the legendary Jack Dempsey. First published in 1950 it has been out of out of print for many years. 

I found the book on the net as a pdf on some site but the text was scanned as pictures so it looked like shit and it was a was huge file. so I loaded up an OCR software and converted the whole thing to text and saved the pictures one by one. 

Figure 8 is missing and I don't have it. The page it was on was missing in the original pdf I downloaded. I got the text on that page from some post on a forum so I hope it is correct. 

Anyway... read, enjoy and help me spread this to fellow boxing fans.
