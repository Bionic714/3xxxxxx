,Edwintje,2006-05-08T21:53Z,"You mixed up Matt and Trey in those photos, the picture called Matt is actually Trey and vice versa.
Big thanks nevertheless."

,Rawns,2008-02-23T10:57Z,Quality torrent! DVDA are wicked! Seed! :D
,Polysaturatedfat,2008-03-23T00:39Z,"AWESOME torrent! As close as we'll ever get to an official DVDA release.

Although I was hoping for a better version of ""Crack""..."
,slurpee,2008-04-03T02:52Z,"yes, Matt and Trey's pictures are mixed up, and yes, that's very embarrassing given how much time i spent on the OTHER stuff, and no, it's not worth releasing a new torrent over, so yes, let's just try to go on with our lives - even if it's just one day at a time.

i, too, was hoping for a better version of ""Crack"".  there is a rehearsal recording out there, probably the same session as ""Sgt. Baker"", but it really lacks the energy of the live version.  Sgt. Baker, on the other hand, is probably a better performance in the rehearsal version.

if you do want to hear the rehearsal ""Crack"", there's another ""DVDA"" comp out there with it in torrent land.  on the whole it's a decent Trey Parker comp but a shitty DVDA comp - there are songs on there that aren't even Trey Parker's.

thanks to everyone who's seeding!  according to my client, i've been seeding this for 1 year, 284 days, for 545.3 copies @ 37.18GB.  another friend seeded this for over a year and 500 or so copies, so that's at least 1,000 downloads.  DVDA rocks!"

""But, dude, DV is impressive, and DA is impressive... DVDA is amazing.""
Is that a quote from the movie? Can't recall... if not, bravo!"
,emo-batty-boy,2008-09-26T00:53Z,"I don't want  to sound queer or anything, but Depeche Mode are a really good band."
,emarshallpurves,2008-12-15T22:31Z,"Just Love the intro for the 'uninitiated fans' (yes i washed my hands).

Great Stuff."

Cheers mate!"
