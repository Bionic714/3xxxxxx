Once again, if there are any offerings to download a .exe ignore - they are not from me!

Enjoy the movie/screenshots. :-)"

,ZuoiRuF,2006-04-28T00:39Z,"GOD DAMN MPEG-4 FILES !!!
I've tried like a million players and codecs and i still can't view the movies, i only get the fucking sound .. What programs do you use out there ? I haven't tried Quicktime and Realplayer because i hate those programs, but i will install it if anyone of you use those to watch those crap files ..

ThanX .!"
