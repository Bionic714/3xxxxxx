,malar,2008-05-13T15:52Z,Nice effort but putting these up in one large package is a terrible idea. 
,jondo979,2008-06-08T23:56Z,"Looks like 20+ people stuck @ 70.9% and 0 seeds.Complete movies in that 70.9%:African DreamsChina BoxLiving in SinSex TherapyHouse of LoveExotic Illusions 2Madness CD2

 Zero seeds isn't very promising... I'll probably only give this a week"
,felisten,2008-07-04T21:02Z,"Well i think you all need seeders. Nice pack, it's like a reunion  of classics

Please keep seeding after you finish your download, and it would be nice if you say at least thanks in a comment. 

We are loosing hundreds of seeders everyday, please help to maintain alive all our good torrents.

Cheers and enjoy the pack!!!!"
,AlphonsoCapone,2008-09-20T02:53Z,"Has anyone on planet earth ever downloaded this 100%? No one will ever be able to seed this, and I would, if the tracker doesn't allow some of us to download it to 100%. Some thing is broken here. "
,AlphonsoCapone,2008-09-20T02:56Z,Permanently stuck at 74.1%. BS torrent unless or until it is fixed.
