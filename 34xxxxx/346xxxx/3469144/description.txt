What's better then an aircraft with two engines? Right, one with 4 engines and if possible one 

that is small enough to park on a small airport. Now AEROSOFT brings the aircraft that is in a 

class of it's own. The BAe 146, aka Jumbolino.

Fully updated from it's FS2002 version by the team that brought you EuroWings, this regional 

jet airliner made in the UK was designed to meet the demanding requirements of the regional 

air transport market where heavy utilisation on short flight coupled with high reliability are the 

most important requirements. Outstanding airfield performance (very short take-off and landing 

and high manoeuvrability) and very low noise levels are other attributes of the aircraft, which 

made it a money making machine for many airlines all over the world.

Powered by four 30.0kN (6700lb) Textron Lycoming ALF 502R3s or four 31.0kN (6970lb) ALF 

502R5 turbofans, this small aircraft has impressive performance. Cruising speed 767km/h 

(414kt), long range cruising speed 669km/h (361kt). Range with standard fuel 3000km 

(1620nm), range with max payload 1630km (880nm).

In two versions (200 and 300), and 36 (!) of liveries (see the list) this product will make you 

long for short runways, complex approaches and moderate weather. A pilots aircraft, looking 

for a new owner. For this price you can't afford to leave it. Click on the images to get a better 

view of the features of this great aircraft.

Contains high end sound set made by Dr. Achim Burger, MeatWater studio and Mike Hambly.
