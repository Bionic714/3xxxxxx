You shouldn't need the last piece. As soon as the exe is downloaded you can find it in explorer and start it."
,FSSR.Pen,2006-04-12T15:39Z,"OK, i tried it out and it seems it is not working. I'll make a new release so everyone can have access to it."

FMC doesn't works:("
,providence,2007-02-04T14:33Z,"I had the same FMC problem i did some googling and found the fix on the DigitalAviation forums.

You are missing some .dll files from windows\system32 folder.

- DWSBC36.OCX
- DWSHK36.OCX
- DWSPY36.DLL 

I found them here:
ftp://ftp.desaware.com/Spyworks/Professional/Update/RunTime/Version62/

My FMC now works."

,Magerna,2007-08-13T11:41Z,"Well, the exe is there, so no big problem...Only the readme file and a piece of a repaint is missing.
Nevertheless I'd suggest you try another torrent-tool like utorrent. They are quite comfortable to use and - as I heard - have less problems with uploads. Plus it uses almost no resources :)"
