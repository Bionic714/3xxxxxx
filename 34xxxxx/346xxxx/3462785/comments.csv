Don't open your mouth unless you know what your talking about. AVG sucks first of all. Second of all, it's false alerts."

People like this spoil the comment system for others, maybe Jiimy8me doesn't know that AVG is gash. It's not his/her fault.
I run McAffee and I know it's a load of bullshit but I don't ram it up peoples noses whenever I see it mentioned..
