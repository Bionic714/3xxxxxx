Looks like I used the wrong tracker, so here we go again:


Been piecing together this one for quite some time, mostly via Kazza and Limewire, therefore the files are of some different formats and at various bitrates. Lots of credits to the filesharers at those networks for keeping this great recording alive.

Anyway, the CSR is a special recording that contains all the words and all the music from Les Miserables-The Musical, many songs like "Master of the House" and "Wedding Chorale" are now significantly expanded and the story makes much more sense now.

As far as the singers go it's performed by an international cast pulled together from various countries, some better, some perhaps not quite "up there" with the best. Valjean is sung by a guy named Gary Morris, while Javert is once again performed by
the amazing Philip Quast from the 10th Aniv.

I've also included a couple of oddities, such as a dance remix of "On My Own" and the two Forbidden Broadway parodies (warning: you may never be able to take "Les Mis" seriously again after listening to "At the End of the Play!" :)

Hope you enjoy it :)
