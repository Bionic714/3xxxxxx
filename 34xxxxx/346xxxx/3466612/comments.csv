,Henrylenry,2006-04-06T16:55Z,"Cant get it to work, umd loader and/or MPH loader. anyone know if it works??"
,pr0f0und,2006-04-06T17:03Z,"Its my understanding this game requires firmware 2.0 and up to work, but 2.0 has no ISO loader, so I think this is impossible until one is released to work on firmware 2.0."

,SquallLeonheart,2010-01-04T20:17Z,"Hey guys, I'm downloading right now. I'll post again when I'm done and tell you if it works or not. It would be recommendable to upgrade to 5.00 M33-6 {I don't trust the GEN series...} if you guys have a low firmware, maybe it will work if you do that.

Sincerly,
Squall."
,SquallLeonheart,2010-01-08T19:57Z,"Ok, I've downloaded the game and... it's a really big let down. There is no sound (at least there isn't on mine), the graphics aren't really good (at certain camera points you can see his eyes through his head) and the controls aren't easy (the analog stick controls the movement, you need to press and hold circle whilst moving the analog stick to look around). So in my opinion, it's not worth the download."
,NKO18,2010-03-31T00:12Z,"Ok I got this working on my 5.50 GEN A
(Pro tip: put the iso in the ""ISO folder not ""GAME"")
It's in english but I didn't get any sound. I don't know maybe I did something wrong but it's a fun game anyway. Thanks ShaDoW!"
,Animeman1000,2011-10-02T09:44Z,"Hey if anyone is still having problems here's 2 links to another one. It's CSO. But if you want it ISO, then download Format Factory and convert it. It should still work."
