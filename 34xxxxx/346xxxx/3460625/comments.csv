,krutan,2006-03-21T19:37Z,Anyone knows if this is real or not? Dice havn't confirmed this game yet.
,IceMaster,2006-03-21T20:22Z,"Maybe that's because this isn't a game.  It's a video, and in the wrong category."
,TinyGrunt,2006-03-21T22:49Z,"it is confirmed, I've read an article from DICE
And yes, it's in the wrong category"
