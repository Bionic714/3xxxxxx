Carmageddon: TDR 2000:)"
,sorin1,2006-03-27T05:58Z,"There is not Carmagedon 3. It is a sequel of Carmagedon 2. It's not even really a carmagedon style if you try it. In my opinion it does not worth the effort, butt hwo knows? Maybe somebody likes it. It's god for the collection (not that i don't have it :)) )

Thank you uploader 
Thank you pirate bay"
