"New World Order: Soloution Or Seduction?"

DVD Format.

An EXCELLENT lecture by Jeremy Lee, a New Zealander on the origens of the U.N and the ideology of the New World Order.

Lee is brilliant in his measured tones and excellent facts and figures. He goes deep into the origens of Communism and the Marxist ideology. The Secular Humanists and the trashing of the Judaeo/Christian tradition underpinning law, politics and the social fabric.

He does spend some time detailing Australia's plunge into the Globalist trap but it is relevant to all people.

After the main lecture there are more that follow including interesting interviews with an Australian reporter.

If you wish to understand the origens of the New World Order ideolouges then I urge you to download and distribute this DVD lecture.
