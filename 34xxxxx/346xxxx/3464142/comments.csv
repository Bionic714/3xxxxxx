,KonspiracyKooknspiracyKoo,2006-03-30T18:59Z,"I have a DivX version but i wanted  people to be able to easily burn it to DVD and distribute.

Will see what I can do. If there is'nt much interest in it i'll repost as a 1gig avi."
,jimmychan,2006-03-31T16:27Z,"Cool, seperate avi's would be cool, easy enough to convert back to dvd."
,KonspiracyKooknspiracyKoo,2006-04-04T16:44Z,"Yeh, but alot of people cant do it.

Actually I could use this service if you want it badly.
