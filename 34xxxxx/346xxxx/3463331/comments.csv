,Rackhams,2006-03-29T00:09Z,Bitrate 256 ??....hmm. It is this silly variable bitrate....not much higher than 192. But a SUPER upload with great music....thanks !. But a constant bitrate of 256 would had been nice ( or 320 ). Just a little complain over the bitrate info....no complain over this great music :-)

Not my rip, just sharing. Enjoy"
