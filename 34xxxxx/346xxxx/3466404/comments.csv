,stuckster,2006-07-28T00:40Z,"This is episode 9 (8am-9am) *not* episode 14 (1am-2am).

Waste of time and bandwidth!
Please label correctly."
,Moirne,2006-08-28T00:11Z,"stuckster is incorrect. He may have been thinking this was for a different season. It is indeed Ep. 14 of Season 5 of 24. It is the 8pm to 9pm hour, so it isn't a waste of bandwidth."
