Exciter    	
Origin: Ottawa, Canada
Genres: Thrash Metal
Status: Active


In their heyday (mid-eighties), Exciter rivaled bands like Anthrax and fellow Canadians Anvil for power/thrash metal superiority, with 1984's Violence And Force regarded as a speed metal classic by many. By the end of the decade, however, their popularity had declined, amidst several lineup changes and their decision to stick to a style that was no longer in vogue. By 1993 the band was at a low, with only drummer/vocalist Dan Beehler remained from the old days, and little was heard from them for quite awhile. After a lull of several years, original guitarist John Ricci put together a new lineup in 1996, and the band's albums since then have garnered strong reviews.

The band's latest recording, a re-recording of several of their early songs, was released in June, with the title New Testament - Coven Of Re-Recorded Classics.
