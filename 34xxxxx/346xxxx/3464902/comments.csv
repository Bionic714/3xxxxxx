,doktorn81,2006-04-01T23:42Z,Thanks alot for uploading this Ethra. Very nice torrent
,boostar,2006-05-01T11:53Z,plz seed
,Fryper,2006-05-01T23:16Z,Yay! been looking for last exile. Thanks to all of you who seed and thank to Ethra for uploading this torrent. Love the first 8 esp that i got on dvd so im sure that the rest will be as good.
,Krails,2006-06-30T07:17Z,"Well, I know this anime is excellent, but I must make the eternal request for someone to seed the files."
,Ethra,2006-07-14T02:59Z,"Sorry, was physicly offline cause of ISP change. Now up and seeding as always ^^"
,Ethra,2007-01-14T06:04Z,"Thank you all for helping me seed this, I will not be seeding this torrent any longer. I hope someone can find it in their heart to take over this torrent and keep it well-seeded. But no torrent of mine will ever die, so if we suddenly run out of seeders, I will start seeding again by demand. Just send a message. I need space and bandwidth for new torrents =)"
,Elethiomel,2007-03-01T00:54Z,"Some of the episodes (11-13 at least) have artifacts coming from the bottom edge of the screen when I play them back in Media Player Classic, using the latest K-Lite Codec Pack.

What am I missing?"
,CptnLekhemNossirom,2007-06-22T00:48Z,"I've been looking for this anime for a while.  Great show, and good thing someone is seeding it.  The only problem is it's in Japanese."
,Ethra,2007-06-26T08:11Z,"How could it be a problem that it's in Japanese? Personally, dubbed anime sickens me :P"
,j00n325,2007-08-06T08:14Z,"Hey, my girlfriend just recently decided she wanted to see this anime for the first time.  could someone please upload this? thanks!"
,Ethra,2007-08-09T01:08Z,Are you dense? It's uploaded and well seeded... Just download and see. 
,jester45,2008-03-06T02:39Z,seeding on 100mbit line now
,Doggard,2008-03-21T07:27Z,Is there an English Dubbed Version?
,Returflaske1,2008-06-20T12:39Z,Could someone please seed ? im at 83% and getting like 4kps =/
,DamienHell,2008-08-11T02:53Z,www.realitylapse.com has a ton of anime that you can download (episode by episode) it uses the server as a dedicated seed and I'm pulling about 40kb/s vs the 3-25 kb/s this torrent is giving.
,senial43,2008-08-21T23:50Z,Can someone with a fast connection please seed? I'm DLing at 6.6kb! No lie. Thanks.
,y0ul053,2008-09-29T21:45Z,"it's not the seeders' connections, it's that everyone's limiting their upload rate.  getting an average of 10k/sec here"
,KyleKyleton,2008-11-03T20:34Z,"Glorious.

I am most grateful."
,Kirothius,2009-05-27T15:02Z,I'm getting artifacts in a lot of the files using CCP (ZPlayer) with all the current updates. I don't recomend dling this torrent because some files are near impossible to watch. I'm not sure whether it's timecode errors or file corruption.
,KommieCid,2009-07-13T04:38Z,Is this subbed/good qual?
,philliph903,2009-07-23T03:45Z,logged in just to warn you all... DON'T DOWNLOAD. ABOUT HALF OF THESE EPISODES ARE COMPLETE SHIT. The audio is fine but it has horrible streaks across the entire video. AVOID THIS TORRENT. 
,hinokiah,2009-07-25T09:19Z,Great torrent! Will seed until I can't anymore!
,imovier,2009-08-25T23:57Z,"If anybody wants dual audio torrent of this, head on over to english-anime.com. that's where i got mine from. that said, this is a very nice torrent. no ""artifacts"" using VLC with latest updates on all of the files."
,panwil,2009-12-10T20:06Z,"I too had some terrible artifacts in many of the files. 7, 11, etc. Turned out to be a problem with MS Mediaplayer's codec. They played perfectly with free VLC Media Player. Great video."
,gabrielkfl,2011-02-15T16:45Z,"ABOUT THE ARTIFACTS IN SOME EPISODES

Solution: Download VLC Media Player.

Some episodes have artifacts in them (graphical glitches). So far, I've found these artifacts in episodes 7, 11, 12 and 13 (haven't watched 14+ yet).

For episodes 11, 12 and 13, you can get rid of them easily by playing with VLC Media Player (freeware).

To date, VLC was unable to fix artifacts in episode 7, but this one has mostly only minor glitches at the bottom of the screen, so you can watch it without worries."
,molee,2011-02-16T10:46Z,"will be seeding whenever i am online.  i piggyback from some douche bags in my apartment complex, so i will be offline from time to time, but THANK YOU for having such a simple, concise torrent.  xoxo"
,Hoov100,2011-04-22T12:33Z,"Alright guys, I've seeded this bitch 7 fold. The end of next week (4-29-2011) I am unfortunately going to stop seeding to make room for another torrent I'm going to start seeding. Message me if nobody is seeding this torrent and I will start seeding again."
,nikotiini3,2011-05-14T05:21Z,It really is shame that anime series like Naruto have thousands of seeders but actually good ones either have 1-15 seeders or are dead.
,BankruptcyInc,2011-05-17T08:57Z,Thanks alot for keeping this torrent alive for so long. I appreciate it.
,Hadiemon,2011-12-21T12:27Z,Looking this for quite while. Downloading and seeding.
,non.modulus,2011-12-22T22:45Z,Can someone please seed this again. Much appreciated!
,OceanEmbers,2012-02-12T12:38Z,d/ling now. Will seed if the quality is any good.
,rapidder,2012-08-08T14:42Z,Many thanks!
,mns7,2012-09-07T01:49Z,Quite bad compression artifacts & hardsubs.
