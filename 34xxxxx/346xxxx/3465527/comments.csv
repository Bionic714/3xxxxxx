,TigerMale,2006-04-10T13:41Z,"Ye, muay thai sure rules, and it's sure a welcome upload;) I'll look over what i have, perhaps something is worth uploading/reseeding"

,dshock,2008-04-06T13:35Z,when I go to download torrent all I get is a torrent document? what do I do?
,knakkerr,2008-04-28T14:07Z,is there a speciall program needed to watch these on pc or can you just play them with wma?
,Truth_Fighter,2008-07-02T15:43Z,"Absolutely great, this has to be the greatest kickboxing/muay thai vid on here. this guy babies you on just about every technique and drills it in your head every chance you get. that combo makes for a great tutorial. 
Check out bas ruttens lethal street fighting if your into being well adapt for any fighting instance/surrounding. F.I.G.H.T ground survival isnt that bad either, so keep those in mind. Happy Fighting!"
,ruud39,2008-07-21T02:07Z,"this is a very good instruction vid, far better than any dutch instructional dvd which is a bit strange as the dutch muay thai fighters are famous for their supreme techniques. also a great instructional vid is the one from duke roufus, again from the states. maybe the americans are more willing to share the good knowledge"
,ruud39,2008-07-21T02:11Z,"by the way, whatever happened to rob mcculough, he's gotta be the coolest sifu in american muay-thai"
,mopiria,2008-09-25T18:22Z,Please seed.
