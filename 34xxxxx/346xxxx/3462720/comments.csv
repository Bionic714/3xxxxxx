,krutan,2006-03-28T18:32Z,This is not E12 it's E13. E12 is about Quagmire getting married
,Samael,2006-03-28T19:28Z,"Like I said, different sites say different things. According to one (http://epguides.com/FamilyGuy/) this is episode 0514 and not 0513.

This one says it's episode 0512:
http://www.familyguyfiles.com/episodes/episodes.php?season=5

TV.com says it's episode 0422.

I think they have been shifting with the original plan. Anyway, I wrote down the episode name for those who aren't sure which episodes they have seen and haven't, so no problems, right?"
,Samael,2006-03-28T19:35Z,"Oh and by the way, all you 522 people who have downloaded this so far, you're welcome.

But instead of a simple ""thank you"" all we uploaders get are fucking remarks about something that is fucked up according to you.

Great to know it's appriciated to upload stuff here!"
