It has been said before and I will say it again: this is a LARGE upload for me.
Anyone who has got the whole 1.42 Gigs, please seed AT LEAST as much as you download. I won't be seeding this forever. If you care about this community, you care about it being alive...not dead.

                                  SPECIAL THANKS

To all my friends out there. Without you TPB would be an empty place!

Most of all, I want to thank MCFC OK for taking the time (7 hours) to upload this add-on to me! Thanks mate for another great addition to our hobby. We owe you ;-)


Happy (Europian) landings,
