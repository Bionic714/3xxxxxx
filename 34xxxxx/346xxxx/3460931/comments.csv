,gereth,2006-08-28T12:42Z,"I sent a message to the uploader several days ago to see if I could get a reseed but haven't received a reply.  I've been stuck at 75.6% for nearly two weeks and am about to give up.  Shame too as I'd like to hear more and have heard this is a great album.  Right now, I'm connected to 21 other people all in the same boat I am."
