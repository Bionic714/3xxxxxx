,Seferine,2006-04-08T22:39Z,"Please if you don't understand what it's all about, don't make a problem with it. Do not submit any comment with false judgements that it is fake or other things. Just don't download it if you have isseus with it.
A screener is a file that can be labelled with all sorts of ownership marks (for example ""property of ..."" or the screen changes to black and white for 30 seconds every 10 minutes). It is ment for press comments en all that sort of things."
,kissthebubble,2006-04-09T20:13Z,"It's real - I think it's ep 19 though rather than 18 - SPOILER WARNING







It's the ep where Micheal and Sara kiss and according to ep guides that's ep 19. So download and enjoy :D"

,xs5,2006-04-11T01:36Z,"0bb3 you are saint! Upload it quick :)

(where/how did you 'find' it?)"
,Snoople Wand,2006-04-11T15:52Z,"Please be warned:

Torrents names s01e18 or 118 etc are infact epsiode '19 The Key'. 

Don't know how, wether deliberate or not but there has been a mess up so if you have watched episode 17 be careful of how much of 18 you watch, just make doubly sure it is '118 Bluff' not '118 The Key' or you may see spoliers. 

As far as i'm aware the real 18 isn't online yet, please leave a comment if you have seen it and can confirm it is what it says it is."
,antarctica84,2006-04-11T17:39Z,"Kom igen... detta är tyvärr nr 19.

,Special_One,2006-04-15T10:57Z,"blomväxter!!! as wodez said u have some very stupid comments. Why do u have to be such an ass? Isn't enough that u take everything u want without uploading anything? And even if is not the episode u're looking for don't u think is nobody's fault? After all, if ep 18 was released u could've find it here. Shame on u! 
Keep up the good work djgunit2005 and don't mind the jurk-offs."
