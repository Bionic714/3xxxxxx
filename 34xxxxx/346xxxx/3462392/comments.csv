,Xeno2007,2006-03-25T19:56Z,"What has a Gothic dating site got to do with this? Excuse the pun on your name, but are you serious?"
,Xeno2007,2006-03-25T19:57Z,Why download the free addition when you can have the full version here? That's the daftest thing I've heard yet.
,Xeno2007,2006-03-25T19:58Z,"Whoops, I meant ""Edition"". Ahhhhhhhhhhh!"
,Xeno2007,2006-03-25T20:00Z,I must have been having one of my wrong- word-version-dyslexic-lunatic moments. And I'm not even dyslexic. Lunatic yes.
,LatHack,2006-03-26T05:37Z,"Imust agree with [tikvesh] AVG is very unsave protection!... Kaspersky or NOD32 is safe 2 use :~)

By the way:
AVG Free Edition has the following limitations:

AVG Free Edition cannot be installed on server operating systems (such as Windows Server 2003), nor can it be used for the scanning of network drives. 
Scheduling options in the AVG Free Edition are very limited (only one scheduled update per day, one scheduled scan per day etc.).
AVG Free Edition receives updates via a lower priority service. Priority updating via ultra reliable Akamai servers is only available for purchased products.
AVG Free Edition does not offer advanced testing options, such as automatic healing, password-protected archives reporting, adjustment of scan process priority and many others.
AVG Free Edition has no technical support!"

And must say that AVG is really good. it found virus that for example Norton 2006 didn't. It's hard to pick a winner but AVG is a really good anti virus if you don't want s책 much CPU usage."
,Xeno2007,2006-05-08T03:20Z,I've since switched to NOD32 AV since I uploaded this. I'd recommend it over this now anyday.
