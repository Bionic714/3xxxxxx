,DJ_Spank,2006-04-07T00:42Z,4 songs were correct. The other ones are fake and one song is an old Blink song.

02. Distraction
03. It Hurts 
04. Do It For Me Now
05. The Adventure
06. The War
07. A Little's Enough
08. The Gift
09. Good Day
10. Start The Machine

01. Valkyrie Missile
03. It Hurts 
05. The Adventure
06. The War
08. The Gift
09. Good Day
10. Start The Machine

,bassackwards86,2006-04-09T17:20Z,"Good Day, The Gift, The Adventure are real. The rest is just some crappy bands covering actual songs (sometimes not even the real lyrics) Everything here was downloaded via Limewire. Go there..."
