,Consider-Phlebas,2006-07-21T16:54Z,Thanks! Great quality. The real # of peers & seeds is (almost as usual) much better than indicated by the tracker. Will seed for a substantial time.
,oceanofdarkstars,2006-09-08T10:01Z,"Hey Could Someone Maybe Mail this To Me Seeing As How I Have The Crappiest Dial-Up Con. Email Me If U Can. Do U Know How Long I've Been Looking For Just this Thing. Too Long.....Oh yeah The Email: Oceanofdarkstars@yahoo.com 

I'll Be Willing To Mail U Anything I Have"
,Consider-Phlebas,2006-09-25T22:48Z,"Wow. e-mail 13.91 Gigs! 
Please take a little time to study how computers and network works. 
1) You need no less bandwidth to receive bits & bytes via e-mail than through DC or Bittorrent.
2) You would have to split the files into order of magnitude 2000 mails if your mail provider has a limit of about 8 MB per attachment (not uncommon).
Lots of mails :-)"
,T-LoPP,2006-12-15T18:20Z,SEED PLZ ^^
,Coxysan,2007-02-21T21:11Z,"""Wow. e-mail 13.91 Gigs!""

Don't you think he means mailing. You know with the post offices and such =S"
,Consider-Phlebas,2007-02-25T13:51Z,"""You know with the post offices and such""
You may be right :-)
Anyway - I've given this torrent 200 GB now, so I'm off for other adventures!"
,putterick,2007-03-26T22:28Z,"sn채lla seeda!!!




Plz seed!!!"
,TheBlackFairy,2007-04-29T16:16Z,"Great job (i think!)

I just started downloading it, but it takes three weeks (!!!) and i actually only need one of the movies (""So The Drama"") and some of the episodes. Is there any chance you could just upload the movie and maybe some single episodes? That would be SO great!"
,blackeagle89,2007-06-23T19:09Z,plz start seeding again..
,Ma-ts,2007-06-26T18:33Z,Seed Please
,Ma-ts,2007-06-26T18:35Z,Or could someone just upload the season 3? :p
,Consider-Phlebas,2007-06-26T20:32Z,"If you're not happy with this torrent there are other KP torrents out there at other sites - several season-based; I found some very active in five minutes - so just use the marvel of the internet: search.
As for downloading just some eps in a torrent, any decent client allows you to that - if your doesn't, switch to Azureus or muTorrent."
,hpavc,2007-10-20T16:47Z,"if you need just one episode, then just download that file from the torrent."
,Wik4,2007-11-04T06:33Z,How do you download a single file from the torrent????
,Jelle999,2007-11-16T23:32Z,Damn. I so love you man 
,Jelle999,2007-11-16T23:34Z,"lol. It didn't get all i wrote.

You are the man. Damn this is what I have been looking for in a long time. Great upload :)
But the secret files and the villains files, have never been on TV, hasn't it? Can I get it on the buy-able DVD or something? Just curious :)"
,Jelle999,2007-12-30T03:19Z,"Damn. Ive completed 78%, and the speed is 2kb/s and 7,6 kb/s. Isn't there anyone who can seed a bit faster?
It will take like 40 days to complete the rest.
I would be very happy for the one who seed with more than 700b/s."
,Heyaz,2008-01-10T07:36Z,"thx very much !!! my kids at school now so he cant stay up to watch it anymore ^^
