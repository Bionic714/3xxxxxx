,shimmerknight,2006-04-04T13:02Z,Anyone else got problems extracting the rar-archive? After the 5th mp3 it just quits extracting...
,WAUWtie,2006-04-05T00:49Z,"I tried to reproduce the corrupted rar-message you are referring to. Downloaded it again myself (from a different location),.. encountered no problems.
Try downloading it again,... if you still feel like!-)
I really like this Cover Business!-)
New one coming up "
,shimmerknight,2006-04-05T11:06Z,"Thnx, will try again (Herman van Veen is a must-hear ;)

Otherwise the problem will be Izarc (my favourite zip-proggie); a friend of mine was asked for a PW when I sent him some files the other day, but there was no PW on it.... 

btw: keep up the good work :D"
