a god game, where you don't control a one civilication nor an entire planet, but simply the nature and disasters of your world. this game is Grrrrrrrrrrrreat and has huge possibilites. for example, if you strike the ground with a meteor it leaves a crater, and if you next use a rain the crater will turn into a lake. but if you first use the rain and then use the meteor, then the meteor will stuck into the wet ground and eventually turn into a mountain. this game really is worth trying
