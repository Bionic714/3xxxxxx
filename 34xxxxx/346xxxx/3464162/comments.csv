,hishamh,2006-08-18T09:57Z,Use Daemon tools to mount the cue/bin files - this app creates a virtual CD/DVD drive on your computer.

Awesome games, superior quality, totally have my sincere endorsement/support-FUCK THE ANTI-SHARING WHINERS!!! Anyone needs a seed, I'll help out if I notice you asking(I use BitTorrent, if that helps)"
,blemishednicely,2007-11-15T06:36Z,"Alright, that's odd...I was trying to check out Unfinished Business (Disc  2), and it allows me to check out the SFI website, registration, and save converter, but neither the game nor the editor are available. It just keeps telling me it can't find the disc. I've tried it with Daemon's configuration set to 1 drive, & doing it solo (even tried it with just gold mounted to see), as well as with 2 drives mounted, consisting of Gold & UB, I even tried RUNNING Gold, minimizing, & attempting to run Unfinished Business..no dice - help, anyone?"
,blemishednicely,2007-11-15T09:14Z,"Nevermind, my woody was blocking the screen; accidentally loaded Daemon with bin files X2, instead of the bin file AND cue file-Was really really high....and I mean REALLY-This is fuckin' awesome (either it's just me or you've even tweaked the sound-sound a hell of a lot crisper/+Db's than the version I've been playing off ""GameTap"").....""I kneel a mortal Man before a God my reason cannot perceive""....AWESOME work glussus, I mean that-sorry for being ""stupid"" earlier on my installation-this version's the cat's ass & works excellent...need a seed, ask and receive."

,ridderstedt,2010-12-18T20:19Z,"I cant open the saved files! Crap! Anyone, cant find any save folder either...."
,Sargon,2012-09-06T12:28Z,"It's amazing to see so many complaints regarding saves not working, problems installing, blah blah blah... Some of you people are just too frieking stupid.

The game works GREAT, and with the JA2 v1.13 MOD it's absolutely PERFECT.

Honestly, the folks having a hard time figuring out how to get this game to install, or work, should stay away from it, since this is the type of game that requires a little more brain power than your average console based stupidificated-take-you-by-the-hand «modern» game. No kiddies, you'll actually need at least an average I.Q. to play, enjoy and finish this game."
