Quotes: Iversen: Aaw, come on! Don't you realize Anna's the third most beautiful woman on earth? She looks a bit like a girl I saw on in a film once. I acually passed out when I saw that film. But then again... I always do when I see naked women.

Not for soccer-fans only, 8 September 2003




As I have learned, you either love or hate Manchester United, or you have no interest in soccer whatsoever. If you hate Man. U. from the bottom of your heart "United" might be hard to swallow. But if you love them (or at least hold no grudge) you're gonna enjoy this flick. The acting is charmingly semi-good, and the story is enjoyable in all it's simplicity.

And for those of you who couldn't care less about soccer, it doesn't matter. It's like not watching The Lord of the Rings because you're not a ringmaker.
