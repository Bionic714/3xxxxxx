It has already fully served all of its usefulness! 
Just let it die now!

The far superior 4.3 has been available for some time now,in fact its been around so long I think its probably their final build and it fixes ALL the annoyances of previous versions of Sonic Stage and the dreadful Connect. just download it free from the Sony site or whatever."
