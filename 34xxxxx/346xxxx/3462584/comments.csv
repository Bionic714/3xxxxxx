,Nautilus704,2006-03-27T17:10Z,"@ ivanhoe68
Strange that it is working for me. I tested it, and works fine.

Try installing BF2 to 
""C:Program FilesEA Games""
Or something like that, this works."

,kke,2007-04-28T20:30Z,OK. I have installed BF 2 and patched it to version 1.4. Then i installed Euro Force. It installed fine. I can see new maps but when I try to select one it says that I must use online account to play this map. I don't own legit copy of BF2 and I only wish to try EuroForce in Single Player. Is this possble without creating online account?

,simguy,2008-04-13T19:14Z,does this fuck up my bf2 and bf2 SF? i wana now!
,presa1200,2008-05-18T19:11Z,"hey guys... cool down first. there is always solution.  After you installed armored fury and euro force, don't apply the crack first, because it is 1.3 version. Since the BF2 was updated to 1.4, that's y it is crashed.

Instead, you reupdate again with the 1.4 patch. Now it will update BF2, special forces, armored fury and euro force in one time.

After update, then apply this 1.4 No DVD crack:

http://m0005.gamecopyworld.com/games/pc_battlefield_2.shtml#Battlefield%202:%20Euro%20Force%20/%20Amored%20Fury%20v1.41%20SP%20[ENGLISH]%20No-DVD/Fixed%20EXE

It works for me. Now when i play the euro force (example Great Wall), no need internet account.

Give it a try."
