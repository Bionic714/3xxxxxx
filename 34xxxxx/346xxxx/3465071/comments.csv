,xLoial,2006-04-05T14:12Z,"Greco:
Yes, you'll need a network connection to your PC, and a file server on the xbox (such as an already running copy of xbmc, or evox, or something)

- or -

you could burn it to a disc and copy it over. However, xbmc is not runnable from the disc, so you'll still need an app capable of file managing running on the box. You could try putting unleashX or avalaunch as default.xbe on the disc..."
,agonelpagliaio,2006-04-10T02:11Z,"hi there,

does anybody know how to use .SRT subtitles when playing a ripped dvd (.IFO)?

I have heard that it was possible with previous versions of xbmc simply by renaming the subtitles file as VIDEO_TS.srt, but how to with the latest xbmc builds?

it is very useful when watching dvds not having subtitles in your own language.

thanks a lot and best regards,
marco"
