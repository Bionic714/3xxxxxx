Basically it patches the ISFD eating too much framerates.


** I have run the plane on APU power on the ground for 30 minutes, without the gauges going black or other funny stuff. Though more testing might be done.


You'll need the v1.0 of this plane installed before applying this patch. Just run the exe and follow the onscreen instructions (no crack necessary).


Many thanks to MCFC OK for supplying me with this patch! You rock!


Happy (better fps) landings,
