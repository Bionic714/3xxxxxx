I live and was born in a Spanish speaking South American country, I've been all over the US, where I feel at home (except in California and Florida which I don't like). I'm not a racist and I defend the rights of mexican, asian, black and other people who have become American citizens and adopted the American culture and English as its language. I think Americans have a right to defend their borders where illegal immigrants are pouring in as well as huge amounts of drugs and the potential danger of terrorist infiltration. I agree with the film's view that the national guards of every border state should be deployed to stop this. I just think that the main commentator in this movie should not be laughing so much as he does because the situation he describes is not laughing matter."
