That would be really nice. i'll also ask this uploader (frozenpea) directly for the file, and if i can get it, i'll seed it out to you other Pirate Bay users. i searched ""Ben Gibbard"" and found it on MiniNova-dot-ORG too, so i'll try downloading it there as well."
,nrpvd,2009-03-23T06:30Z,I'd greatly appreciate it if someone would seed this!
