,kitire,2007-05-03T00:06Z,"Okay, heres what you do.

First off, go to your torrent folder/crack/xxx.exe copy and paste it into 
C:\Program Files\particleIllusion_3 or wherever the hell your folder is.

Click on the exe, and it gives you an error, click ok, then go to torrent folder and click on the ""Libraries (before reorganizing"" folder.

You should be good to go :)"

,notherand,2010-01-17T14:52Z,does this work for leopard 10.5.8? .. 
,zarigueyo,2010-03-21T21:32Z,"notherand:

I have exactly that version of the OS and this download does work. Even if it says PPC and I have an Intel processor.

HOWEVER, and this is common to EVERY version of PI that I have found so far, the program has some functions missing:  the commands which are accesed to by right-clicking on a layer or action do NOT work.  If you click in, say, command 5, either 3, 4, 6 or 7 wil be chosen.

Some of this commands can be accesed by other means (read the manual; for instance the ""properties"" are accesed by hitting command+enter) and others, as I said, can be accesed by choosing a different command than the one you need.  Yet for some commands there seems to be no way of getting there (I cannot create a SuperEmitter, and I do need to!!!)

As I said, I have found several versions, 2 here and more in GFX world or Avaxhome (some of them might be repeated, but at the very least I have downloaded 3.0.5, 3.0 and this one here.  And they all share the same trouble.

If someone ever gets a working version for mac, please let me know!!!"
,chaucerchris,2010-04-09T22:11Z,Well is this does work then the hell is not installing any of the libraries? I've downloaded this from different sites and it's not installing correctly and wont open.
,chaucerchris,2010-04-09T22:14Z,"I install this program when I had a windows machine and not only did it install correctly but it also installed the libraries, not this version. "
