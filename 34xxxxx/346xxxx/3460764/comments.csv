,Lashmush,2006-03-28T11:14Z,"Eehm, considering that theyve RELEASED the fucking game RETAIL i would assume the RELOADED release isn't a fake. Jesus fucking christ,  how dumb are you people anyway?"
,toyotomi,2006-03-30T02:53Z,"Ok, I'll avoid arguing with all the little nitwits here and give some real feedback to those who want to know.

This works great.  This is just a patch for the game release by RELOADED.  You can get the full game release here on TPB.  http://thepiratebay.org/details.php?id=3460819

Easy to ""install"" and doesn't cause any problems."

,Jmraub86,2007-02-28T06:06Z,"Sometimes I Look In Amazement How Dumb People Can Be, A (Trojan Virus> Virus Downloader) Think About That A Sec, Okay Some Rar Zip Files Can Contain, Worm, Virus, Trojan, Its Not Hard To Seperate The Files You Want From The Files You Dont Just Use Classic Interface Drag Out What You Want Leave What You Dont Want.  !!USE GOOD JUGEMENT!!"

,OrlopRat,2007-12-16T20:07Z,"I can't believe you idiots who say this is fake because it's only 2 MB.

,PawnSacrifice,2008-02-24T01:38Z,"Some virus software will show files to be trojans when they are safe. I've had this happen before and you can simply ignore it. Please note, I said ""SOME"". Or it could be a trojan. Buy cheap buy twice and as this is free...you get the idea. "
,10fDbest,2008-04-30T12:37Z,"Try reading the all the comments before you spam go all crazy. There's probably the answer in one of the comment, that's why they are here! Oh, and plz seed!"

,petadaman,2009-06-20T02:22Z,"there isnt a trojan, its just that because u dont need a cd, it uses soft ware that virus programs would otherwise class as a virus, but its perfectly safe. oh and can somebody plz start using iso. for reloaded cracks, i am fucking sick of the message. cannot find file. plz reinstall bla bla bla"
