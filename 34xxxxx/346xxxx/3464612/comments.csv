,fphdaj01,2006-11-21T01:09Z,"As far as I have managed to resolve what is included in this chaotic compilation, it contains:

Almost all of the 10 CD box ""Steve Reich: Works 1965-95"", except that ""Six marimbas"" which is on Disk 3 there is missing. Also instead of Disk 9 which is only excerpts from The Cave, here the full two disk set of The Cave is inculded.

Then also ""Three tales"" is here, which is not included in ""The Works"" collection, and some 10 pieces the origin of which I could not resolve.

Great collection though. Cheers!"
