,TonyHarrison,2006-04-06T16:00Z,if you rename the .r00 file to .r12 then rename the .rar file to .r00 end extract the .r00 file it seems to work for me.
,elvios,2006-04-06T22:56Z,wow.. you're right.. Thanks dude ;D 
,throwaway2006,2006-04-09T22:52Z,Jag tycker rar-filer bara är ivägen på bittorrents; .torrents innehåller checksummor själv. Och jag gillar att kunna granska filmen innan nedladdningen är klar.
,cognacdude,2006-04-18T22:59Z,I agree to whatever he said. Sounds reasonable ...
,whipper89,2006-12-08T18:15Z,"How do you get the ""r00"" name to appear? Here files are named ""south.park.1003.dsr-loki""..:|"
,Myg0t2,2006-12-27T04:04Z,"A realy nice!





Thanks Neotic"
,trapdog,2006-12-30T10:45Z,Corrupted file
,aerotux,2007-05-29T03:06Z,"This torrent is NOT currupted. If TonyHarrison's comment does not work try this: rename r00 to r12. Then reneme every rNN to rNN-1 (ie r01 to r00, r02 to r01, and so on). The problem is that r00 is the smallest file and should be the last one."

This is shit"
