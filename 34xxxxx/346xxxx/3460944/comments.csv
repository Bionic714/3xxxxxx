,raezenkane,2006-11-13T23:17Z,Having trouble creating DVD.  Nerovision freezes about halfway through and DVDSanta garbles the Movie at about the same point.  Downloaded it again and it did exactly the same thing!  First part of the movie is awesome!
,neamhni,2007-03-13T23:55Z,"Exact same problem here. Tried three different burning software and all of them fail about 45 minutes into the film. Also redownloaded with the same problem. Too bad. Good quality, okay on PC."
,erlend,2007-05-21T08:49Z,"Hey, sorry, it might be a glitch in the compressor. Didn`t realize this because I have the movie. I`might put full DVD on if people want?"
