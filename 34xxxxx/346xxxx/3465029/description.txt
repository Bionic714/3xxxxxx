Deranged disco metal? Gonzo noise-punk firebrands? Genre munching mega racket? Chaotic noise-hop? Here are a band who namecheck Motley Crüe, Rick James, Pharell Williams, Slick Rick and Slayer as well as an increasingly long list of future star bands like Need New Bodies and Sex Positions. At 25 (Rory Atwell) and 19 (Sam Mehran and Devonté Hynes) they listen to everything: metal, grime, hardcore, rock, hip hop, pop. It?s all in there. And boy, can you tell.
