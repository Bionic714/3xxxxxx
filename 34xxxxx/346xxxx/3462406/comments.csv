,Primon9,2012-02-14T19:10Z,"For you people talking about Osho's ""wisdom""... this is the same guy who's cult poisoned almost a thousand people in the 80's. He was deported for a reason, he's a lunatic. He's not saying anything that hasn't been said before, he just throws a more radical spin on everything. He's just a typical paranoid schizophrenic, delusional and hard wired to say things some idiot somewhere will find ""wisdom"" in... "
,Primon9,2012-02-14T19:14Z,"@ Onizuka3

Maybe you're right, somehow this crazed lunatic figured everything out and only HE knows the ""truth"" about god, the universe and everything.
I wouldn't count on it. there's a 99.999999% chance he's just a fucking lunatic. And before you go accusing me of believing in the repor (rapport??) of the ""lord"", save it. I'm an athiest."
