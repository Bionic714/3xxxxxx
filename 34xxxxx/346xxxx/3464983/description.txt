This is the same as http://thepiratebay.org/details.php?id=3464761 but with half the resolution (360x240 instead of 720x480) and a lower bitrate (1250 instead of 2500)

"This is a speed run done by Fernito and I. Fernito plays, I figure out glitches/paths (not so much so in ep1), plus encode/edit.

This speed run only includes episode 1 of Duke Nukem 3D. We have full intentions of releasing the runs of ep2 to 4, plus other variants, in AVI format. Please stay tuned.	"
