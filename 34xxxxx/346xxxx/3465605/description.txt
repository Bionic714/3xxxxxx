     Easily the best Prodigy album out there, and that's
     really saying something. All of the tracks are based in
     energetic hardcore techno, but there's an incredible
     amount of variety here. Everything from metal guitars
     ("Their Law") to shattering glass ("Break and Enter")
     is used as a sample, and all are used effectively. The
     album doesn't have a single weak track on it, but the
     true highlights are the singles. "Poison" is probably
     the darkest track the Prodigy's ever done
     (**including** "Firestarter" and "Breathe") and it's
     great. "One Love" sounds a lot like an older rave
     track, but it works really well and doesn't overstay
     its welcome. "Voodoo People" uses LIVE guitars and
     flutes in a breakbeat track that will get you moving
     like no other. Then there's my favorite: "No Good
     (Start The Dance)" which pastes together a sped-up soul
     vocal and a ridiculously intense beat. It'll leave you
     gasping for air, but in a good way.
