INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

1. Edit the included ugnx4.lic file, replace the  on the first line with your host name.

2. Install Unigraphics NX FLEXlm, when asked for license file, select the modified ugnx4.lic file.
After license server installation completed, open C:\Program Files\UGS\License Servers\UGNXFLEXlm\ugnx4.lic
and make sure the daemon's location is correct.
eg: the 2nd line of ugnx4.lic shoud be
DAEMON uglmd ""C:\Program Files\UGS\License Servers\UGNXFLEXlm\uglmd.exe""
If you plan to install ugnx4 in different directory, please modify uglmd's path in ugnx4.lic

3. Install Unigraphics NX4.

Good Luck!

I've done all the steps in the installation instructions and I've got Nx 4 installed without problems. 

The problem is that I can't open the programme at all. 
I get this message; 
Initialization error - UGII_TMP_DIR was set to a directory with an invalid (non-ASCII) character.

What does this mean? I've tried to uninstall and reinstall a hundred times, and to repair the software and so on, but nothing seems to help.... "
,cmm,2006-12-07T17:45Z,"The first line in the license file is

I am using ZoneAlarm firewall, and have blocked uglmd.exe and other NX files from accessing the internet. Is that why it isn`t working?
Should I let them connect, or can something bad happen?"
,kjetilr,2007-03-02T15:20Z,"can someone make a good install guide for those who have ie 7?
"
,kwlewis,2007-04-14T21:00Z,"For all of you who still can not find a good install guide, it is in the first disc.  it is the readme notepad file next to the .lic file that you need to edit in the MAGNiTUDE folder"
,rauul_the_pool_boy,2007-04-16T22:37Z,"for all having problems--fix is simple.  once installation is complete, please do a search on your pc for psapi.dll.  when pc finds these files there will be one or two that are in system directories.---do not delete these!!!! You do want to delete the psapi.dll file that is in the NX4 base directory.  this was in there due to an earlier conflict between windows nt and windows 2000.  IE7/windows xp already have a psapi.dll file so the one in NX4 is not needed and causes a new problem.  delete and re-start program.  problem solved!"
,rauul_the_pool_boy,2007-04-16T22:40Z,"I have a new question.   Does anyone know where to get the NX4 ""CAST"" program. (Computer Assisted Self Teach).  It provides a great tutorial on NX4.---you know, so you can actually use the software."
,seven_in_milan,2007-05-21T23:38Z,I've downloaded the other torrent of this program but I didn't get it installed. Hope to succeed with this one. Looking at the amount of downloads versus the posts posted I have quite high expectations. Anyone has any clarifications to come with that might help during installation?
,libertybmx,2007-07-28T14:40Z,"hi,

ive successfully downloaded this and have copied the files to cd.  when inserting the cd i need to install the NX FLEXlm.

How do i edit the included ugnx4.lic file and replace the first line with my host name?"
,libertybmx,2007-07-28T14:48Z,"just read that might not need to install the FLEXlm?  Is this the case?

I tried going straight to the NX install.  But it asks for a License Server.  Any suggestions?

Im not great with cracking software so any help would be great.  "
,libertybmx,2007-07-30T23:12Z,"ok, ive managed to get this to work fine once i could alter the ugnx4.lic file.  No other mods neccesary.

As previously stated tho, there is a installation guide in the MAGNITUDE folder next to the ugnx4.lic file."
,dt_jjwoo,2007-09-22T22:10Z,"Hi there,

I couldn't install the software. Would you guys please help.

Thanks a lot"
,jackito,2007-10-02T22:17Z,"hi just for you that want/need to know. to edit the ugnx4.lic file you just need to open it using notepad, then change the word 'host', on the first line to your computer name, next save the file.  then install the flexlm license server, during the instalation you will browse for the license, browse for the newly modified ugnx4.lic file.  once all installed every time before you use nx4 you will have to go to start>ugs>license options and then select the license bundle you wish to use. then once added you can use the program as you wish.  hope this helps "
,scubadru,2007-12-24T06:33Z,"Thanks JACKITO...people follow his direction, worked great...it apears that you can only add the top 2 bundles, once done, run UG"
,woody489,2007-12-25T20:07Z,"I'v finally got this to work

,philets77,2008-10-04T14:38Z,"Hi, I try to install nx4 on Vista. I tried 2 things:
1- Install nx4 only and follow the instruction with the cd (change host name in the liscence and copy in where thet said). In the lmtools, I browse my liscence file and when I click on the Stop/Reread tab, I get the message that ''License Server Not Found''.
2- I un-installed it. I re-install with installing first the liscense server but I get the following error: Error 1920.Service Unigraphics License Server (uglmd) failed to start. Verify that you have sufficient privileges to start system services.
