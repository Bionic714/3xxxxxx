           mks@gotiger.com"
,Alkivar,2006-04-09T00:45Z,"GAH what crap... 

90% is in crappy encoded 128kbit mp3s half of them sound like they were recorded with an old Xing compressor (you know that watery distorted sound).

Glad I wasted my time... "
,CoaxTheGreat,2006-04-09T02:38Z,"Why .RAR format?? it makes no sense! the bandwith saved by compressing is minimal when talking about movies and music.
It makes a little bit of sense when splitting a movie in to small files, so you can re-download a part of it if an error occours. 
But this makes wery little sense..."

,ChrismanPSP280,2008-04-04T17:50Z,"I agree, rarring it is stupid. I think a lot more would download this, if it wasn't rarred. As Coax said, the space saved is minimal, and people needing maybe   just a few albums will leave this torrent."
