3. Kritiek part 1 & 2 (1987, 9.04)
"Kritiek" can be translated as "critical" or as "criticism". When Komarov was launched in the Soyuz 1 in a vain Russian attempt to win the race to the moon, it was already known that the vehicle was suffering from "unsatisfactorily solved problems" including the solar-panels, the automatic landing guidance-system and, the fatal one, the opening of the parachutes. Komarov showed incredible courage by going up anyway- and went down cursing.

4 - 6. 4 Studies for Korg MS20 no 2 - 4 (2006, 4.51 - 4.36 - 4.11)
Four attempts to construct, as Hero calls it, "tunnels of sound, one of the ultimest goals one can reach for in music: the creation of hearing-depth!".

7. Burning Sims (2004, 9.40)
Digital creatures that do everything for us that we want them to do-  like working, watching television, making love and turning into ashes. Make ideal kosmonauts.

Live electronics combined with parts of a recently rediscovered EMS VCS3-tape made by Hero in 1975.
