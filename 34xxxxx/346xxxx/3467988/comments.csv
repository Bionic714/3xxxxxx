,Werwolf6,2006-04-08T01:22Z,I also..
,patroli,2006-04-08T01:39Z,"Thanx Pop, but ditto on the other comments"
,B744,2006-04-08T01:56Z,then do what it says. download the dvd 
,Archon2005,2006-04-08T02:12Z,"I agree B744 that its probably the best idea to download the entire DVD, that way you have everything.
Kinda defeats the purpose of uploading just the SP1 when ya have to download the DVD anyway tho ;S"
,PopArt,2006-04-08T04:44Z,"That's my thought also. But when people ask for just the SP1 you would think they have the DVD already. Anyways, take it or leave it ;-)"

,DangermaN87,2006-04-08T06:03Z,"Thanks PopArt ! 

Is it possible to have install more liveries even though this is the DVD version? If anyone has any more of the SP1 Liveries (they supposedly changed the liveries and so you have to download new SP1 liveries or something), please upload them.

Thanks !!"
,brgcat,2006-04-09T19:46Z,"Thanks popart but this is for the Just Flight DVD Rom version which can be downloaded free from Just Flight. However we still need the original DVD to make it work!

What we need is the new PSS 777 instaler only available from their website with original purchase proof."
