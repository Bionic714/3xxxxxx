This is the new beta firmware for the linksys wrt54gx4. Its version 1.00.15. Linksys tech support will not admit to its existance right now, so it took some real doing to get a hold of this. Use at your own risk... From what I hear this actually causes more problems than it solves for most people, but it works better for me.
