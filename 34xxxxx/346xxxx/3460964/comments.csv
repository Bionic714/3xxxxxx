,maze42,2006-09-11T02:46Z,please seed!
,colmcg,2006-09-19T00:20Z,"has been downloaded ZERO times ...pls dyssident re-upload ,but in parts 1-5
we will love you forever........................................................................................................"
,maze42,2006-09-21T08:29Z,"well, zero isn't really accurate, is it? I downloaded the torrent two weeks ago, and I've been waiting for a seeder ever since... that's one download at least."
,maze42,2006-09-26T21:01Z,"""They cannot be distributed as DVDs because they originally sold as limited-edition art objects. If a sculpture is in an edition of six, you can't make more of them. It's not right for them to be available to be owned in an unlimited way after they've been sold in a limited way. I have the right to do theatrical distribution of the films, which I've done with 'Cremaster' and 'Drawing Restraint 9.' In Paris, they have now, for the second time, brought back the series. It's certainly a better condition to see it than on a monitor.""

,PadamP,2006-10-03T11:20Z,"Damn, it stopped after i got 1,18 Gb down, that makes for all of the first one and some of the second. Quality is not very good (quite bad in fact), but still.... I've got no-where else to watch it.

... it would be so nice with a re-seed..."
,maze42,2006-10-16T19:38Z,Dyssident (or someone else who managed to get the whole thing mack in March) please reseed... We are 20+ leechers stuck on 36%
,Continuity2,2006-11-26T21:44Z,"That above comment made by Barney really REALLY bothers me.

That's like saying, well no one should see the Mona Lisa unless you have all the money to travel to the Louve in France and only there you can view it and appreciate it, and it should never be reprinted for it will only tarnish the image like its something holy. Which it certainly is not.

Which is a whole lot of BULL. The kid, the young filmmaker in Topeka, Kansas has as much a right to see it as some pretentious art dealer in NYC has to see it, though he probably owns it. Which isn't right at all. It's art and it should be appreciated by EVERYONE!

I swear if i ever got the money, and got a hold of one (hopefully all), trust me it would be up here and torrented like a mofo.

DVD's these days are the easiest to crack. And his would be no exception."
,nitrostar,2007-02-04T06:41Z,Can anyone please please please seed the rest?

It's certainly within his right to do what he wants with his work.
Also, the only reason you know what the Mona Lisa looks like is because it is out of copyright and is one of the most famous pieces ever created (thanks to the lackluster theft of it in the early 1900s).
I'm not condoning what he's doing, but he has a philosophy and he's sticking to it. Also, while he is ridiculously rich now because of it, it shows that he isn't taking complete financial advantage of his work."
,Mister_Cheech,2007-03-20T10:36Z,"PadamP, please keep uploading, many of us do not have all of the first film."
,dyssident,2007-03-23T08:53Z,"sorry about the seed. i lost these files in a hard drive crash.

,macumming,2007-05-03T17:17Z,"I just checked this torrent and was shocked by the 0 seeders and 0 leechers.

I'll do my best to seed it for the next few month to improve the situation."
,macumming,2007-05-03T18:31Z,"Wasn't able to seed this one because the version I have is different.
