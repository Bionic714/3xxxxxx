From XLR8R-

East Coast duo Exile & Lokey trade rhymes back and forth as easily as bootleg Star Wars DVDs in Chinatown-their symbiosis on "Sinking Ship" and "The Bridge" seems as much the product of practice as talent. And they got the latter for days-Exile's backing tracks are hearty, guitar-driven jams that sound like later-period Massive Attack, brooding and epic. As lyricists, the two pine nostalgically like Rhymesayers' Slug without sounding trite. And that's the whole point. ? Al Boogie

 

From Vapors-

12" pick of the month!

Providence, Rhode Island known (as of late) for its art school/street art heros and Emo rappers (Sage Francis) has blessed us with a rap duo bound to get that head nod going. What this 12" lacks in "club bangerizm" it makes up for in lyrical flow and content. The two emcees work in unison playing off each others verses and flows. The backside dabbles into some more experimental hip-hop most notably in the drum patterns. From flirting with drum & bass patterns to downtempo breakdowns "The Bridge" and "Signs" keeps it real- Providence steez.
