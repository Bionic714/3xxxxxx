,idiotic.puppet,2006-08-07T02:32Z,"Umm, is there ANY chance that someone will upload the Season 2+3 torrent again? I mistakenly deleted them a few months ago and I'm kicking myself for it since almost everything else I like (Las Vegas, The Shield, The Wire etc.) can be found somewhere else, but for Homicide: LOTS there is only one place, and since I don't own an NTSC-tv OR a region free dvd the boxsets are out....someone?"
,beachtime,2006-08-17T20:09Z,"can anyone please upload season 2 torrent, thankyou"
,wagesage,2006-09-05T23:23Z,"I downloaded this, but for some reason when I play it in my windows media player,there is no sound. I made sure the volume is up and that it is not on mute. Anyone else having problems with this?"
,SpringareG7,2007-02-06T22:39Z,"Oh yeah! THANKS! The best serie ever!
"
,SpringareG7,2007-02-07T23:53Z,"Please seed...

,catchow58,2008-01-02T20:11Z,"Thanks, netizen!  Awesome series!

I can't wait; I'm starting out by downloading the classic ""Three Men and Edina"".

Anybody got the TV reunion movie?"
,claroque6,2008-01-28T15:05Z,"TV movie wanted here too, please...
Anyone got it???"
,sonicpixie,2008-02-06T04:53Z,"WOW!
Finally I can download the ONLY crime tv show I ever really loved."
,ashymonster,2008-02-08T14:46Z,Great File.  Thanks a bunch.
,Loell,2008-09-17T04:49Z,"Thanks so much, Ive been looking everywhere. Someone please seed."
,closetpervert,2008-11-25T12:42Z,"Thanks... is it just me though, or is the quality not very high?"
,Lenny9,2009-02-18T00:01Z,"I'm sure the quality sucks, it's 400 megs an episode. A gig an episode would have been sufficient."
,homicide93,2009-07-09T20:41Z,where is season 3?
,Diceman_,2009-07-14T04:32Z,"I just downloaded a 350 MB episode from Ninja Video that's terrible quality, so he may have a point."
,eengleeshpeeg,2009-11-08T19:11Z,"seed, please."
,qbik88,2010-10-09T01:17Z,watch out while watching this - the parts are not put in chronologically despite what do the filenames say!
,kmac4648,2011-09-16T15:10Z,ty
,nehoc,2011-09-26T20:10Z,"Low quality, but watchable, and maybe we can't go better for this great series."
,diverdiva,2012-05-10T09:37Z,"I know this is an old torrent, but only the first 4 episodes will download - bittorrent coming up with message ""unable to download tracker, blah, blah - does anyone know what this means and how I can get the other eps?"
,diverdiva,2012-05-10T11:27Z,OK - the other episodes popped up about 20 mins into the download - go figure! But all good - thanks netizenk
