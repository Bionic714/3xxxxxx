Release Note:

One of the all time classic electronic acts, Kirlian Camera return with one of the most eagerly awaited and possibly best new albums of 2006.

This pioneering Italian ensemble present "Coroner's Sun" impressively proving what happens when an allready accomplished band move on to set new limits in innovation, invention and experimentation. Completely unperturbed and unaffected by current trends or cliches, the band continue to follow their blazed trail with "Coroner's Sun" - this stunning new work combining Kirlian Camera's typical electro sound with dark poly-hymns which give songstress Elena's voice again more room for development !

Kirlian Camera have come full circle, returning to their roots with more vitality than ever : rhythm, structure and effects of each and every song are absolutely perfect. High-resolution soundscapes, sound-design that seems to be endless and high-tech samples which are both classical and ingenious. Mastermind Angelo Bergamini's vast imagination slowly - though with a steady hand - carries the listener away into an ocean of melancholy with mystic and mysterious songs that reach beyond the borders of electronic music.

Additionally this version also includes a Bonus CD complete with exclusive songs, unreleased material and Bonus remixes. This special collectors Edition is Limited to 2000 copies only.
