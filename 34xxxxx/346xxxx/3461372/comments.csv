,Dezsike,2006-04-07T15:39Z,"You can add them right now, upload in the right order is not important. Its good because strider2004 don't need to buy the #16-#17 and can spare the money to #18. I would help too, but the only thing i can do is seeding."
,stub1982,2006-04-12T01:40Z,"sorry, i dont know how to upload files or even crate torrents. Anyone able to help?
