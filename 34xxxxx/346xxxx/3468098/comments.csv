It's not to be or not to be lazy:
What version is? 2010?, 2007?, 2003?
How many languages are included?, 33, 50...?
What languages are included?
It's an ISO, multiple RARs...?

We know the meaning of ""proofing tools"", but more information is needed. It's similar to say: I've got a Windows CD. Oh, perfect,!! a Windows!!, wonderful!!
What version?, W98?, WMillenium?, W2K SP2, or SP4?, VISTA?, what kind of VISTA, Ultimate, bussines?...

Nobody wants to waste his time and bandwidth without a minimal of information."
