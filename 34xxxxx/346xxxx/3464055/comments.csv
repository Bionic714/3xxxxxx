,verediam,2008-06-20T19:34Z,"First of all great show, great upload but It seems that the episode order is wrong. It looks like only the november episodes have their airing dates written properly but are numerated wrong.
-White lies episode should be 5.06 instead of 5.05
-M.E., Myself and I should be 5.05 instead of 5.07
-The True Test should be 5.08 instead of 5.06
-The Heart of a Saturday Night should be 5.07 instead of 5.08

Hope this helps cause its a bit weird watching some of them in the wrong order.

Again, great upload, cheers."
,ClemH,2008-10-22T17:18Z,"hey, how about Seasons 1 - 3 ?
wouldn't you have those too?

this is my all-time favorite cop/detective series, which unfortunately never watched from the beginning, so I'd love to get the early seasons (as well as the later ones) because I want to watch the whole series from the beginning.

if you (or somebody else) could upload the early seasons, I'd be so grateful."
,hspank,2008-12-05T21:30Z,"where is season 6? can someone reupload them?
namely the episodes written by David Simon: ""Finnegan's Wake""	Season 6, episode 21 (story) ""Full Court Press""	Season 6, episode 18 (story), 1997	""Blood Ties: Part 3""	Season 6, episode 3 (story), ""Blood Ties: Part 2""	Season 6, episode 2 (story)

,Electrish,2010-07-10T03:29Z,@verediamnnThere\'s a difference between the order in which shows were originally aired (the order NBC wanted to try to max out ratings) and the order that the producers of the show intended to be aired. Perhaps that could be creating confusion.
,imzima,2011-12-07T08:25Z,"thnk u so much caseyjones. i couldn't believe that this was still available. i know this might be a bit late considering how long its been since u put this up but is there any chance anyone out there could upload a copy of both S06+07?
i believe this is amongst the greatest TV dramas of all-time"
,spektator,2012-05-31T22:43Z,"I downloaded seasons 1-5, thank you, is 6 somewhere up? "
