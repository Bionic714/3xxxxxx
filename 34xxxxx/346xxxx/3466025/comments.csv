,macrovision,2006-04-04T01:58Z,fuck! where are the DVDs!?
,macrovision,2006-04-06T21:50Z,"BAD NEWS. The DVD disc in the Remastered package is a DVD-Audio. Not DVD-Video. That means, unless you do some really tricky stuff, you can't rip it. And even if some did, it would not have a structure of a DVD-Video. So we're gonna be stuck with the SACD Standard CD Layer as for lossless."

,guckli,2006-04-07T19:07Z,Bull. It's a DVD-Video alright. Check remasters.depechemode.com. Complete tracklist with encoding details on the back of the package.
,macrovision,2006-04-08T01:06Z,"well... some are saying it's DVD-A, not DVD-V, but if it's a DVD-V, I'm waiting for this to be ripped!"
,micleg,2006-05-12T19:55Z,"Well, from the web site it is quite clear that there is a SACD and a DVD. The latter containing a documentary just like the others. Can't someone that video track or the whole DVD? Please!?"
,micleg,2006-05-12T19:56Z,...someone RIP that video track...
,macrovision,2006-05-16T03:52Z,this stuff has been released only to Europe! not even US yet. So we're relying on our english fellas...
