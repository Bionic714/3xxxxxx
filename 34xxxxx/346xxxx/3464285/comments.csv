,gigante1,2007-05-26T22:20Z,"The antivirus update feuture seems to stop working when installing a fake license-key.
Tryed it in 6.2, 6.3.0, and 6.3.1....same error
Please inform us if there is a way to get around the problem!
It works fine in ver.5.6 (but ver.5 does not work OK with outlook-2007)"
,gigante1,2007-05-26T22:34Z,"ItÂ´s a bitch.
Perhaps an automated script that does this:
1. stop the mail-engine.
2. copy all files from C:\Program Files\Common Files\Network Associates\Engine to C:\Program Files\Kerio\MailServer\mcafee
3. start the mail-engine.

Anyone with a clue in how to make the script?"
,gigante1,2007-05-27T00:32Z,"Probably solved easier than I thougt.
Run McAfee antivirus on the same server as Kerio MS. And set McAfee to update every 2:nd hour or something like that
Create a new txt-file and rename it to something.bat
put in these rows:
REM Update MCAFEE Kerio mailserver by Gigante
net stop keriomailserver
copy C:\Progra~1\Common~1\Networ~1\Engine\*.* C:\Progra~1\Kerio\MailServer\mcafee\
net start keriomailserver

Save it, and make a background-job run it every 2:nd hour
I have not tested it yet, but I beleve it to work."
,gigante1,2007-05-27T00:45Z,"Hmm.
2 minor things I discovered:
1.The Mailserver will be down for about 15-30 seconds wile this script is running, so it may be wise to let it run ones a day maybe 2 am or so, or at a time when their is no, or wery little traffic. 
2. If you are connected to the admin-console all the time (like me) or when it runs, you will have to push the button ""reconnect"" to the admin-consol every day."
