This is a self-extracting installer for the Grey Wolves Supermod for Silent Hunter III. It is intended to be a simpler, automated alternative for those who do not wish to work with the original 7Zip compressed files. The installer is designed to work with the JoneSoft Generic Mod Enabler but can also be used without it by changing the default extraction path. It was created from the original Grey Wolves files by a third party not affiliated with the Grey Wolves design team.

Good Hunting!
