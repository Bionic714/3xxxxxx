,Philosogogue,2007-01-10T05:38Z,"The answer to the audio without video is the codec.  If you look at the movie properties, you will find to the right the codec--likely it will be the 'IV41', but there is also a 31 just as annoying.  We are talking primitive technology here. These codecs play properly only on OS 9.  The work around is to get the codec for the earlier Quicktime on the net (it's free), and put it in with the OS 9 QT.  Reboot from System 9, and play the movie from the earlier QT.  You may have to get a QT as low as 4 or 3.  This problem occurs whenever you see an AVI file that is not Divx or DVD.  Unfortunately, there are no converters for these formats. Everybody, please, label your codecs on your uploads and save everybody time and effort.  You may want to spread this information around."
