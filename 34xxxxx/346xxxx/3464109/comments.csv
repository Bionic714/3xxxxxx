,samwazoo,2006-03-30T17:03Z,subs??
,wolf359,2006-03-30T17:44Z,Thanks for these but which are you seeding first?
,KonspiracyKooknspiracyKoo,2006-03-30T18:38Z,Have I fucked up? I've got 100K of upload to play with and little experience uploading. Any advice appreciated.
,KonspiracyKooknspiracyKoo,2006-03-30T18:39Z,It's all on the same disk. DVD with menu's.
,KonspiracyKooknspiracyKoo,2006-04-04T16:55Z,"These torrents have ALL been here for ages in AVI format. This has been done for people that I have sent here to get. It is in dvd so they can copy and distribute.

Not everyone in internet land knows how to convert to dvd or even want to. They want to download a DVD that they and their friends can watch and then burn and give to others.

If you hunt around you can find them in the format you require. :)"

My original mistake.

Be patient, i'll seed til the cows come home."

,yourenemy,2006-09-26T09:05Z,"WTF!!!  this is an excellent download,  but the secrets of the matrix is incomplete.  it's looong, but its a three part  presentation, and this only contains the the first 2 parts.  right before he starts talking about the really ""bizzar"" stuff i.e. the reptilians it ends.  does anyone have the full dvdr."
