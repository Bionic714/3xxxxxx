"The Illuminati/Masonic Movements and The New World Order."

DVD compilation of 3 documentaries with interactive menu's.

1) "The New World Order". An excellent and very slick production. Much information. 

2) "The Lightbringers". Juri Lina's excellent, well crafted expose on the Masonic movement. A must.

3) "The Secrets Of The Matrix". David Icke...I dont like this guy and his "lizards". However, he is an excellent presenter and the material is good. Just switch off when he gets to the shape shifting lizards.
