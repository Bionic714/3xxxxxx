No one has more than 83.4% of the file.

Shame you couldn't finish this one of for the 30 people that are now pretty disappointed with you mate!

Looking forward to seeing them @ the BDO though."

,O61470,2008-01-29T15:32Z,"Well, I made it to 83.5%... but the maggot who posted this torrent clearly has no clue... so I'll take the non-lazy option and rip my own copy of this CD to mp3, and post it up here rather than waiting for this douche to let somebody get to 100%.

You NEED this album. Then you NEED to see these guys live. Then go buy a copy. 

This CD will be up here soon on a new torrent."
