,biglierman,2006-04-16T22:36Z,"This movie is really shit. Its just a sadistic pice of crape. Whats the fucking point with cutting of body organs with different kind of tools. 
Sick movie for sick people."
,zoltan_jeff,2006-04-17T11:45Z,unrated 94 min?Min version är 99 min.Något är väl fel när det är 94 min speltid.
,ryda4lif3,2006-04-19T00:09Z,"If you don't like the movie then don't DL it. Just because you think something is sick an twisted, don't tell other people that it's a piece of shit movie. and that it's not worth the time or space to download it. Obviously if someone is downloading the movie then they already know what it is about an if they don't then they should do research on a movie before downloading it.  If your ganna comment on a torrent then just let us know what the video and audio quality is like."
,Mamba4ever,2006-04-21T16:00Z,"I agree, if you don't like the movie then don't download it or write shitty comments you bunch of sad ungrateful fuckers!!

Cheers to the Uploader for their efforts"
,GreenEyes75,2006-04-21T19:09Z,"Hello, can somebody help me to convert this file (NTSC) to PAL (Europe) - MPEG. Once converted, i will burn it with 'Nero'.
Thanks again!"
,From_Hell,2006-04-21T19:43Z,"I have to admitt that this movie has a good plot. Not of my taste though because it's too f*ckin detailed. If it were more splatter, then I probably would love it, like a trauma movie. It's not wasting time to download it, but I tell ya, some stuff is really sick. 

Don't watch it with your hypersensitive girlfriend! ;)"
