,Mac Gaver,2006-04-05T04:17Z,"@Lambrusco:

Its 5.1 or only DTS ???

Why the Image splitted in 1 GB chunks ?

Great upload !!!!  Thanks."
,Lambrusco,2006-04-05T15:12Z,"@ Mac Gaver.
The DVD has all the audio tracks avalaible at the original one (It's an identical image).
I've made 1 GB chunks because some Operating Systems can't manage files greater than 4 GB."
