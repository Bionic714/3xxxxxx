,phxcityslick,2006-03-29T02:04Z,grrr now i have to find the ntsc version (nothing against pal) I just can't play it on my DVD player
,jbraven,2006-03-29T11:24Z,Any subs?
,=michael=,2006-03-29T12:47Z,phxcityslick use dvd info edit and you can make from a pal dvd a ntsc dvd!
,tisemann,2006-03-29T23:45Z,"The NrrW release doesn't have any English subs, so the torrent info is wrong.

If you want English subs, you must grab the NTSC retail release, Memoirs.Of.A.Geisha.PROPER.DVDR-MPTDVD."
,hfw,2006-04-01T14:23Z,"An NTSC-version (dvd9) is available here (under the wrong category - Video) : http://thepiratebay.org/details.php?id=3464715

If this one does not start uploading soon I'll go for that one"
