,solielj,2009-02-07T07:45Z,tomtomx is using what's called a - Personal attack ad hominem - thinking a persons defects refute his or her beliefs in order to discredit the contents of this video. I have not watched the video yet but I know that Eustace Mullins has made other videos. Some of them are anti-jew. He is trying to say that everything Eustice Mullins says should be considered false because he has made other statements that could be considered racist.
,nwo777,2009-08-02T14:42Z,This is a very good interview about the problems of fluoridated water. They discuss the issues associated with allopathic medicine and how the cancer industry are making money with phony cures which are given by the rockefeller foundation to simply take patients money before they die. This is a must watch documentary . Thanks for the upload :)  Spread the truth
