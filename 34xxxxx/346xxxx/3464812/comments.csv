,ewokman(sdf-1),2006-07-19T10:04Z,"Hi all  this buttsniffer has used an very old AMIGA program called hj-split to make the files and you need a program called hj-join to put them together you can find them here http://freebyte.com/hjsplit/#win32 however i do nok yet know how to burn the file yet, but when i find uot you will be the first to know."
,T0MMIK,2006-10-27T17:15Z,"i have tryed everything and nothing works.
how do i burn this game. i have tryed nero, alcohol 120% and i can`t find the file.     plz help."
,rambooka,2006-11-27T04:22Z,"once the file has been processed with hj-split, the resulting file is called pal-trlp. Then using Hex worksop, i looking at the data inside the file... there is ""RAR!"" at the beginning...  so i renamed the file to pal-trlp.rar    Now RAR says there is a file ""pal-trlp.iso"" in there...  when RAR goes to uncompress the file, it asks for ""pal-trlp.r00""  thus i sill cannout get the file....

I also looked inside the torrent file ""pal-trlp.001"" and the first 3 bytes are ""RAR"" to i doubt that they even need processing with hj-split...  i renamed the file ""pal-trlp.001"" to ""pal-trlp.rar"" and i am still getting the error wanting file ""pal-trlp.r00""... so i am closer, but still have not yet resolved how to get the ISO from within the files..."
,rambooka,2006-11-27T04:39Z,"i got the file onto a DVD now...

the files are part of a RAR archive...

rename .001 to r01  .002 to .r02 etc...
the double click the .r01 file, winrar should load up and the you extract the .iso file some where onto an NTFS partition and use Nero to burn the .ISO file onto a DVD  !!!"
