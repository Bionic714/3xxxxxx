Friends of dark meditative ambient are in for another treat with this new co-creation from the Finnish ambient composer/producer Doc and the Russian keyboardist Lena Selyanina. This album was inspired by Maurice Ravel's waltzes for the piano, and Lena's soulful and introspective piano takes quite naturally a prominent role on this material. As on their earlier releases (MT002 & MT004), the fundamental soundworld and atmosphere is that of deep beatless ambient, with deliciously layered sounds and carefully crafted, slowly evolving tonal structures. Then there's the piano - often close and intimate, dwelling peacefully in subtle and rich ambient harmonies; at times wandering more playfully amidst complex tonal structures; and at other times acting as a source to more electronic and artifical sounds.

There's a certain cinematic and dramatic feel already in the music itself, and this sense of drama is accented by subtle lines, sighs and sounds originating from some noble and ambient movies by Wim Wenders (track 1), Ingmar Bergman (tracks 2 & 5), Krzysztof Kieslowski (track 3) and Andrei Tarkovsky (track 4).
