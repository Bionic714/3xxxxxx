,screenslave,2006-12-15T19:28Z,"Well, I apologize - it works perfect with xvid (of course) and plays beautifully. Sorry for being an arse, trixtah. The Windows mediaplayer fucked it up."

Robster65, it does seem to be a slightly unusual encoding - I don't recall where I got it - but it opens fine in VLC on both Windows and Linux. You can get VLC here: http://www.videolan.org/vlc/"
