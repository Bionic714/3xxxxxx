                    It's been a long time coming, but the 
                    journey from Morrowind to Oblivion was 
                    worth the wait. Fans of the Elder 
                    Scrolls have had to wait almost four 
                    years for a sequel to Morrowind, the 
                    sprawling, epic game set in the land 
                    of Vvardenfell. Luckily for them, and 
                    for anyone interested in quality 
                    role-playing games, Oblivion has 
                    finally arrived, and it's even bigger 
                    and better than its predecessor.
