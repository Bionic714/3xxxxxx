,Elipse,2009-05-02T08:56Z,Thanks Ulysses and those who are seeding!! Any others that were born on a piece of the Earth and taken and named American should listen to the insight of Sharath_1861. It is through the immediate and causal actions of the Christian/Abrahmic and Western world that have caused the majority of distasteful acts in the world. Their actions have a tendency to fuel extremism and cause many to resort to drastic measures. The best example of this is the battle in the Occupied Territories of Palestine and Israel and America's spin and continuance of utterly disgusting acts on innocent people in their own homes.
