""The band was nameless for their first two shows. They decided that the audience should decide, and at the end of their second show they asked the audience to yell out their ideas for a name. One audience member suggested ""Fallout Boy"",[6][8] a reference to the sidekick of the Radioactive Man from The Simpsons[5][9] (which the band performed the closing theme song for in the 2009 episode ""Lisa the Drama Queen"").""

That's from Wikipedia. So it was what that fan named them, but they chose to split the the word.

Peter Wentz does NOT own Fueled By Ramen, John Janick & Vinnie Fiorello own it. However John Janick, helps Peter run his own record label Decaydance, it WAS an imprint (subsidiary) label of Fueled By Ramen, but it's independent now."
