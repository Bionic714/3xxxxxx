,Meanman,2006-03-26T17:34Z,"Sry to say, but this game sucks so bad..here's what i think of it..

- Graphics: 6, they are not very impressive..

- Audio: 8, the audio is the only impressive in this game...

- Gameplay: 5, VERY bad gameplay, this is so bad..the first FC beats the shit out of ths game in gameplay..

-Multiplayer: 7, fun for a while with the predator skills..

Longevety: 4, layed it for about 30 mins..very boring!!

Overall: 5, not very impressive game, very boring..The only thing that i lied about the game was then you were a predatorn and runned fast and jumped high..

Total flop, download if you want but you'll only be angry about it's lacking grathics and bad gameplay.."
,[IT]Occasus,2006-03-26T22:23Z,"It doesn't work in my PAL xbox.
I decompressed with rar 3.5.1, then decompressed the iso with xbiso, then I uploaded the files with a FTP client.

It says ""The disk may be dirty or damaged"""

,skullcowboy9t9,2006-04-02T18:00Z,"For some of the noobs out there that couldn't get this or many other games to work, here's a tip that no one ever gives.  Try going into the E:/CACHE directory of your Xbox.  Delete everything inside the folder, but not the Cache folder itself.  Voila!"
,LoudZulu2,2006-04-14T05:16Z,"Im Sorry, Im a Complete Noob at downloading stuff for my xbox, i havent downloaded anything for it, or messed up anything, so please let me know how to do this, i heard it wasnt that hard.

so please post or reach me at: kreepydude123@yahoo.com"

,tooler,2006-05-23T23:55Z,"I Can't unrar this!!!  tried to urar a-farcie.rar and go this message ""The archieve is either in unknown format or damaged""
I then tried a-farcie.r00 which gave the WinRAR Daignostic message ""no files to extract""

I'm using Winrar 3.42

File size is 1.43 gig, 33 files in total.  Any ideas?"
,SoundWall,2006-09-14T09:38Z,"Meanman,

I've got the ""Predator"" version for the 360 which includes both the original XBox's games.
They're AWESOME! You must be mixing them up with the pc-game, which sucked ass.

The graphics aint the best, sure. The sound totally sucks (at least on surround sound, gets totally messed up). But the GAMEPLAY ROCKS! It's intriging and exciting and you get stuck for hours.

The PC game on the other hand is the crappiest game I've ever played."
,gal_name,2007-02-28T13:48Z, PAl or NTSC???????????
