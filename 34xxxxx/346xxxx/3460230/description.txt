PLOT:

Han Suk-kyu plays a man who isn't explicitly named but is called Makdong, 'youngest sibling', throughout the movie. At the start of the film he meets a woman, Mi-ae, on the train while returning to his parents' home after completing his mandatory military service. He later seeks her out, only to discover that she's the lover of a local mob boss, Bae Tae-kon. Having no job, Makdong ends up seeking employment from Tae-kon and enters the world of organized crime.

Makdong's feelings for Mi-ae grow throughout the film, but his loyalty towards Tae-kon also grows, and Makdong and Mi-ae never end up together. In the end, Makdong kills an associate of his boss to protect Tae-kong's interests, but as a result, Tae-kong has to kill Makdong to satisfy his organization's sense of justice.
