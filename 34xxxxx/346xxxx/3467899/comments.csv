Um, where's your UPLOAD? Seeder, what a joke!"
,KBFI_man,2006-04-08T01:24Z,Thanks!
,draco7891,2006-04-08T04:07Z,"@Mogz

Not sure what you mean. I picked the files up as a loose rip of the DVD, and just re-assembled it with Nero, tested, RARed and upped. It's in .iso format as it is, to assist with burning."
,Mogz,2006-04-08T17:11Z,Well you packed the .iso into a multipart .rar. which even if i tried to make mine into one it would still never work to help you seed. :(
,draco7891,2006-04-08T19:41Z,"Betcha it would. As long as your disc is the same as my disc in terms of the data files (which it should be, and you pack it the same, it should hash properly. RAR's and ISO's are really just container formats; as long as the data is the same, it will hash.

Try ripping your disc and RARing it with ""best"" compression, and 50,000,000 byte archive size."
,WWII_Flyboy,2006-04-09T07:01Z,"Well I'm at 65% and going stron I will seed this for 2 days after I get it all Complete!
