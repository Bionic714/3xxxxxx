Simply put the file *.bgl in your fs9/addon scenery/scenery directory.

OR

Move the folder of this scenery to fs9/addon scenery and add it in the scenery library

I hope you enjoy this scenery. It was created with FSdem using data found here 
ftp://edcsgs9.cr.usgs.gov/pub/data/srtm/ .

You may not make money with this product, but you can do anything else you want with it.
