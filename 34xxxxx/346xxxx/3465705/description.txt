     The influence of Bristol, U.K.'s Massive crew on
     bringing trippy beats to the foreground is
     immeasurable. Not only were they the early test ground
     for other alterna-hop stars (ex-clansman Tricky, former
     songstresses Nicolette and Martina, and the lesser
     known productionists Smith & Mighty), they've spread
     their influence to everyone from fellow Bristol
     residents Portishead to Bj√∑rk. Blue Lines is Massive's
     debut record and is the second musical union of
     Bristol's renowned collective, Wildbunch. The emotional
     purging and beat-driven orchestral movement of
     "Unfinished Sympathy" was among the first signs of life
     in contemporary English trip-hop culture. Other
     masterpieces, like "Daydreaming," which features Shara
     Nelson, Tricky, and other friends on the mic, throb
     with deep, dubby beats and soulful ambiance. Blue Lines
     marks the beginning of a musical legacy that is ever
     expanding.
