,leonardo_iannello,2007-01-24T16:47Z,"This is a great torrent!!

The only problem is that the 2nd and 3rd season soundtracks are included in the 2ns season folder.

If you sort the files by Disc, you can separate them."
,joseph_malik,2007-08-18T22:54Z,"This torrent contains soundtrack 1-4. Soundtrack 3 is just mixed up with soundtrack 2 but it's there and it's complete.
Just sort the soundtrack 2 directorys by albumname and move the trax to an new directory."
