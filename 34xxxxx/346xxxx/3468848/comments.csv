,JohnDoe57,2008-09-02T00:06Z,BTW- How the hell do you fix the sound?!!! I removed all the items in the Sound folder and put in MP3 files of the SC3K soundtrack and still had no luck.

,heeding_the_call,2008-10-12T14:18Z,"ok. alot of you seem to be having problems with the audio.

this is a symple problem to fix.

download the songs from this web site: http://simcity.ea.com/coolstuff/sc3k_music/index.php

hey wait... the songs are in mp3 fromat... 

convert them to wav... (like the existing loop song...)

now coppy them to C:\..................\Simcity 3000\Game\Res\Sound\Music.

enjoy"
,gwapitaz,2008-10-22T20:44Z,"TO FIX MUSIC AND PLAY FULLY, Do this:

First thing, Download all 15 music files from:
http://simcity.ea.com/coolstuff/sc3k_music/index.php
(Note they are .mp3 files, you need to convert them to .wav files.)

Then follow these INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Extract ""Simcity 3000 FULL.zip"" (No install required)

2. Convert Simcity 3000 Music Files from .mp3 to .wav format.
   (Music Files found in ""Simcity 3000 Music Files"" folder.)

3. Copy the .wav to game dir (Example: C:\Games\Simcity 3000\Game\Res\Sound\Music)

4. In music dir, Rename each "".wav"" files corresponding to each "".xa"" files 
   Example: You see ""3KD1.XA"", and you have ""01_SC3K_Power_Grid.wav"", 
   -It goes like this: ""01_SC3K_Power_Grid.wav""=""3KD1.wav""...)

   Rename just ALL of your wav files to:

   3KD1, 3KG2, 3KJ1, 3KJ2, 3KJ3, 3KJ4, 3KP1, 3KP2, 3KP3, 3KP4, 3KP5, 3KT1, 3KT2, 3KT3 & SC2BUG

5. After, Go to game directory (Ex: C:\Games\Simcity 3000\Game\Res\Sound),
   Open ""AUDIO.ini"" with notepad locate this:

   MusicDataDir=e:\sc3000data\cdimage\res\sound\
   ; MusicDataDir=d:\sc3000data\cdimage\sc3\res\sound\
   CachePath=c:\temp\

   Delete that and Replace with this: (It matter to which Game Directory You Extracted it.)

   MusicDataDir=C:\Games\Simcity 3000\Game\Res\Sound\Music
   ; MusicDataDir=C:\Games\Simcity 3000\Game\Res\Sound\Music
   CachePath=C:\Games\Simcity 3000\Game\Res\Sound\Music

  (If you installed it in other game directory, just change to where music\ is.)

6. Also in ""Audio.ini"", open again with notepad, locate this:

[Music]

(Note that i just change .xa to .wav to activate the music wav files, 
just make sure you follow ""STEP 4"" correctly.)

7. Launch the Game, Go to Preferences ""Enable 3D Sounds""...

8. There you go Complete Simcity 3000 with Music....

When I start it, it all goes well, the game starts with the movie, the music is there. Then, because of my wonderful vista 32 bit system's security, it wants to update, and asks me for my permission for it to. I say yes, or no. It brings me back to the desktop, with the game still running. I click back into the game, and my mouse doesn't work. I can move it, but it can't select things.

Wow.  Hey kieran_268_uk- Thank you for taking your time to share this game with us.  Even if there were to exist issues that _couldn't_ be resolved (there's not), I appreciate your sharing this classic game title.  See, I find it difficult to complain about, let alone RAGE on, a game that I DIDN'T PAY FOR.  Thank you again.  I will seed till either Dec 2012 or Iran threatens 2 nuke my city.  Danke!"
