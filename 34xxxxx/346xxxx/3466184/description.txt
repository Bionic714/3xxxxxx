Excluding the singles, i believe this is the entire collection of elliott smith. If you don't know who this is, I highly recommend downloading it, he is definitely one of my favorites, if not my absolute favorite. The cd listing is as follows:

x/o
elliott smith
Roman Candle + Division Day - No Name #6
From a Basement on The Hill
Figure 8
From a Basement on the Hill 2
Either Or

now, if you know anything abotu elliott smith, you probably know that there is no such thing as from a basement on the hill 2, but this is a compilation of other songs he recorded that never made it on a cd, and has some of my personal favorites (including the cat stevens cover Trouble)
