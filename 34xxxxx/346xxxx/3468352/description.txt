tomtom_5.21_wm2005_ppc_+crack

So here we go.
At last i working version for WM5.

Just installed this on my Qtek 9100 with WM5 and it works great.

Move the five .cab files.

gps.cab
PIMAddIn.cab
ttn.cab
voice12.cab
wzd.cab

The cracked files are.

TomTom Navigator.exe
CurrentMap.dat "in the TomTom map"

--

So what you do is moving all the files to the device.
And then open them in the device, i started with wzd, voice12, ttn, pimaddin, and at last gps.cab

After all the installation is done you get the "TomTom Navigator.exe" from the
crack folder and replace the one in the folder on your device /program/navigator/..

And now u get the TomTom folder in the crack folder and place it in My Documents in your device.

Now the only thing left is a MAP.

If you are from Sweden you can use the map from this torrent 
"TomTom mobile 5.20 Scandinavia (v.605) for Qtek 8310 Smartphone"

Place the map where ever u want, the program will prob fint the map it self, did it for me.
