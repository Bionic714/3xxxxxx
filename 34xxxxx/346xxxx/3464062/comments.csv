,Philcastro101,2006-04-17T22:15Z,I downloaded tge Guess Hoes Coming To Dinner episode from a moonsong torrent.  From 1:02 to 1:06 in the episode the screen goes blank.  Is the episode of Guess Hoes Coming To Dinner in this torrent the same?  If this one is good can somebody create a torrent of it so I can download it?  Tell me if you do.
,Blazig,2006-04-20T22:07Z,"Because of the reason I have too low free space on the harddrive, I can only download 2 episodes at a time, but now I've donwloaded them all and so I write the comment here instead. =P
I just wanna thank you so damn much. I missed the first episode on TV, so I was like ""Oh well, wtf, I'll download it instead"".
Thanks man, they work great!"

,ZorAk771,2006-11-29T06:09Z,Does anyone else notice there are a lot of artifacts in the first half of the season.  It seems every time the show switches scenes it digitizes and there are artifacts everywhere.  Not something I would put my name on if I encoded.

,BloodLogic,2008-05-31T16:25Z,"If you're looking for crisp, clean, quality versions of seasons 1 and 2 of the Boondocks, then download this other torrent.  These are the Moonsong rips, in which there's a few seconds in minute 1 of S1E03 where the screen goes black and the audio is mute -- an incomplete version of the episode.  Not dissing on Moonsong, though, because he puts out some really quality rips for some obscure shows.  But, if you want the Boondocks, with perfect quality, seasons 1 + 2 complete, then download this other torrent...

,BloodLogic,2008-07-12T01:24Z,"****** Hi, ya'll. Sorry about the above-post. The first torrent I uploaded had some issues. I fixed it and reuploaded a fully working version. Sorry again, and please again, the immaculate, perfect versions of the Boondocks, Seasons 1-2 complete...

Thanks, and seed, mateys!"
