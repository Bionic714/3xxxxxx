They sure as hell have gigantic reserves and will MIL MONEY by telling us they have small.

So we will have oil for decades to come, stop the enviremental bullshiting will ya?
Automobiles Vs bus or train, hahahahaha yeah you ride the bus and ill take my BMW, have a good time."

Sure, Oil won't stop flowing over night, but it will deplete eventually."
