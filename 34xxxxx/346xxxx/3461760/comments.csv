,Adcimo,2006-03-30T00:45Z,Thanks for uploading this.. any chance of posting Season 2?
,MojoVampire,2006-04-01T05:25Z,"Unfortunately, I'm having a hard time finding complete copies of Season 2, and most of the episodes I can find are 450+ meg mpegs.  I might do a recompress on the ones I can find and seed them, but it'll be a while."
,kaskpeet,2006-04-02T00:35Z,"This totally sucks.
The quality of files is quite low and in every 5 minutes the picture ""crashes"" for 15-30 seconds. 
Although this is the best show, there is no point of watching this with so low quality."
,MojoVampire,2006-04-02T03:30Z,"Crashes for 15-30 seconds?  I think in one or two of the files there is a single five second long glitch in the encoding.  Nothing like you describe.  Are you sure your codecs are up to date?

I'll grant, the encodings are just TV rips, but they are pretty good for their file size."
,MojoVampire,2006-04-02T03:39Z,"I will grant, they aren't ""high quality.""  If you're looking for that they don't seem to exist right now.  But they are definitely watchable, least for me."
,kaskpeet,2006-04-03T00:44Z,"Sorry for my previous comment. They are not very bad indeed. At least they are better than nothing, right? :) If only the quality was more clear then they would be excellent.

And the glitch you described, it happens to me in every file. No problem with other movies."
,Mxyzptlk1,2006-04-19T03:07Z,Är det någon som vet var man kan få tag i swesub till Monk? Farsan gillar serien men han är inte allt för haj på engelska...
