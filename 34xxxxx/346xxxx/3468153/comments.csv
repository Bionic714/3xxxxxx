,w3sleym,2009-01-22T07:31Z,almost died in the process of trying to scroll to the bottom of the text to read the comments
,YukonR,2009-01-30T03:18Z,"i got a blister trying to scroll past all that text.  anyone who would actually read that excessive history probably would've just bought the cd, and not download the torrent here you penishead.. who cares, i just want depresso music to listen to alone in my room.  well except for my little brother, in the bunk underneath me..and his annoying friend benny ""grimes"" - who by the way, i think isn't just dirty..but possibly gay-homo..which is fine, but if you like to air dry when you get out of the shower, its not cool to do in front of gay-homo.  anyway ill find out soon enough about grimes, by the expression on his face, after i slip my thumb in his butthole next sleep over.

well thank you for the upload, i do appreciate it, and i take back the penishead comment.  sorry."
,intheairtonight,2009-03-21T20:08Z,"thanks for the up, dont know why people bitchin bout the text, maybe they should just buy a bigger monitor"
,burndogg,2009-07-25T23:26Z,"Eh...I am gonna pass on this, but to the guy who is thinking about slipping his ""thumb"" to the other dudes butthole...that's pretty gay, dude..."
,daniel98,2011-10-05T10:31Z,who wrote that terrible review? 'melodramatic angst?' 'postmodern shaman?'  great album though.
,slimHXCchance,2012-06-18T19:14Z,Dont cry about the text. So the dude is really into NIN and wanted to share some info with ppl. How can you complain about scrolling on a computer screen either lol? Are you guys that out of fucking shape that moving a finger an inch or 2 is to much work?
