Hello all retro-game lovers!
This is my first upload, so i decided it had to be something worthy. I thought some REALLY rare adventure games should do the trick, and these are rare and really good at the same time...

1. First we have Fade to black. Its a very uniqe third-person shotemup with some adventure elements. Feels and looks like a Tomb Raider game. It was a revolutionary game when it was released. Dont remeber the story really.

2. Bermuda Syndrome: A sidescrolling adventure-game that takes place in a dinosaurworld. You are Jack, that are trapped in the strange dimension when he flies above the bermuda triangle. He have ti find his way home, an at the same time rescue the prinsess (i know, it sounds preatty stupid).

3. Time Commando: This ia an old classic that I find very fun to play even today. You play as a guy named Stanley. His mission is to defeat a computer virus. To do this he have to travlel throgh time, and killa people... Or something.
