,thorgin,2007-08-30T15:57Z,"I never played Fade to Black, but I did play Bermuda Syndrome and I still own my copy of Time Commande that I purchased back in '96 or '97. I always thought Time Commando was a very good game and looked very good for it's time. Bermuda Syndrom is sort of interesting, but in the end got too boring."
,rarson,2009-01-05T01:13Z,"I know this torrent is rather old but could SOMEONE please seed the last of it?  I will seed for months if I can ever finish it, but I'm stuck at 98.5%.  Bermuda Syndrome is done but Fade to Black has another 10 MB to go and Time Commando only 6.

I mostly just want Fade to Black."
