,Deznaj,2006-03-31T14:31Z,"This series is very difficult to come by, so any upload is really appriciated. Cudos to you rs04!

That being said, this season is of really crap quality. In some episode, half the screen is filled with scandinavian subtitles.

Season 4 is out on DVD in the US, so there has to be a DVD-rip somewhere. Please upload!!!"
