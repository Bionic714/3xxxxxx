Tack på förhand! "
,hotspice,2006-06-26T16:34Z,Does anyone know if there's been any releases of Star Trek DS9 from Petsel since S5D3?
,karekare,2006-06-26T19:18Z,"Hotspice - i tried to send petsel a message, but haven't received any reply. I haven't found anything beyond s5d3, so i don't think he has released any more. Let's hope he will soon though. :)"
,hotspice,2006-06-27T11:15Z,Petsel was alive and kicking in the middle of June at least. I saw him answer a question about seeding earlier discs of DS9. Really hope he´ll return soon with some nice DS9-seeds :-)
,hotspice,2006-06-27T18:10Z,Thanks Soundtrekker! I will take a look.
,Da King,2006-06-27T19:46Z,Same here! I see you can convert them back to normal dvd. That's what I need! But Petsel on a re-entry trajectory would also be kewal!
,Peracer,2006-06-29T15:45Z,thanks soundtrekker but I want swedish subtitles so I hope that petsel returns soon or someone else upload DSP season 5 - 7...
,petsel,2006-06-30T13:45Z,"Hi All...
I havnt left you guys hanging. I have converted the next disc and made the torrentfile. I only have one problem. I cant upload it to Piratebay, I have tried different browsers. I get a time out or cant connect to the server..."
,Swashbuckling_Matey,2006-07-01T10:21Z,Sorry to hear that Petsel.. please keep trying..  Have you thought of posting to mininova?  I have all to S5D3 and can't stop now!!!...
,Skalmanhusen,2006-07-02T17:37Z,petsel...youre the man...As I said before...I am totally hocked on DS9 now =)
