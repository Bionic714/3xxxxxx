Howdy folks, I was looking for this film on various Bittorrent sites but my search was unsuccessful. I thought it would be helpful for anyone wanting to watch this if I uploaded it for sharing.

The quality's not the best, I got this about three years ago on emule. 
I have included a sample file so you can check the quality and decide if you want to continue downloading.

Nonetheless this is an enjoyable but very 'arty' movie. If you know and enjoy Beat Takeshi's unusual style of directing you will certainly love this.


I will be seeding at 25kb/s on my 256kbit upload so this will take around 8 hours until you start seeing more than 1 seed.
