Burn the image file (.iso) on a CD, use ImgBurn to make it very easy for for yourself: http://www.imgburn.com  This is the best CD-DVD buring enginer there is and it's free.

Now, I believe that if you have not had your PS2 modded with a chip (to make it play all regions, backup discs a.s.o.) you need to use a swap-trick to make your newly created CD load correctly. If you don't have a CD to use for a swap trick, I don't know what options you have. Perhaps none, it depends. Seach the Net, use Google. One tip for you: http://www.ps2-scene.org/forums

,rob7792,2008-03-31T15:23Z,"Davidbeats23,  do you have any idea how much of an ass you are?

Seriously,  google could easily answer your question, but instead you go and try blaming your fuckup on somebody else, mainly because. You fail.

Don't wait and ask what to do, become independant and find out for yourself.


Anyhow,  Thanks for the torrent. :)"
