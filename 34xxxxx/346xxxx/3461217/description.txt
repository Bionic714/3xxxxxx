Some days you just need to open up a can of severe folk whoopass on yourself. It's on these days that Orkestina's Transilvania Express will come in very handy. A fascinating concoction of the Gypsy and Jewish styles of Romania, Bulgaria and Poland. You get your klezmer horos, reels, freylakhs, and whatnot, delivered with technical brilliance and emotional intensity. Also the recording/production is one of the best I've heard from the genre. And finally, thank you guys for sticking with the trad instrumentation. The otherwise practically genre-standard vulgar attempts at 'modernizing and developing the sound' simply by throwing in some electric guitars, drum sets, or worse, is almost guaranteed to end you up in embarrassment. 

If I'm madly in love with this record? Guess so. :)
