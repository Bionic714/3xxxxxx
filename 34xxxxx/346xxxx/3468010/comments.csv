i was going to do that , but i didnt want to hear people complaining that the DVD size is to small for a DVD (900mb). i released a simpsons DVD with only 2 Episodes (season 17)  on a DVD and all i heard was complaining about the DVD size and how it is a wast of a DVD :(

i got a good upload speed going, so i hope you get this fast, so you can enjoy the 2 new Episodes on this DVD :)"
,speakeasy,2006-04-08T11:23Z,"Thanks deathmule - sounds like you can't win  :-/
Downloading now :-)
@JooiZe - it's a DVD . . . can't do that."
,Theone70,2006-04-10T17:27Z,"Something weird in this ""LOST season 2 Episodes 0 to 11 on 3 DVDs By deathmule"" , ive got only 9 parts (.vobs) in it....so 1 episode is missing, i wonder what. Or is that torrent 1-9?

Same thing in ""LOST season 2 Episodes 14 to 18 By deathmule"" there is only 4 parts (.vobs) in it? If i count right episodes 14-18 makes 5 parts.

Or am i ""lost"" somehow :-) 

anyway thanks for these."

,Bi$on,2006-04-18T11:48Z,"Deathmule, how do you make multiple avi files into one dvd file to go onto a dvd?  When i do it, i get a video_TS file for each episode, can i do it so i have one file for a number of episodes? PLEASE HELP!!!"
,Shhako,2006-04-27T15:46Z,Umm im sorta new on this so maybe this's a stupid question but... how do you play the files..? I tried to play the VOB but then there's no sound... 
,vladmyr,2006-04-28T23:55Z,To play them you burn the files in the Video_TS folder as a DVD or use a DVD viewing program to mount the folder.
,RyanJames,2006-04-30T13:50Z,"I need some help, please. I downloaded the files by deathmule and burned them with DVDShrink. On my DVD player the video shows at one frame per 5 seconds and the audio is a steady stream.

As another option, I downloaded them as .avi files, used WinAVI Convertor to change them to DVD files, used VBOBlanker to process them, and then DVDShrink to burn them, but the same thing happened.

Then I tried converting them to Mpeg2 files with WinAVI and burn them as VCD, but WinAVI will not start to burn at all. I am stuck.

Needless to say, I am new at this, so instructions need to be step by step, please.

I then tried WINAVI "
,RyanJames,2006-04-30T13:52Z,"Part of my message was cut off. WinAVI will load the files to burn, but it will not start the burn process. It just sits there, though it shows in the Task Manager as running."
