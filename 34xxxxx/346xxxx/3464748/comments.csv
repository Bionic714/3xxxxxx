I really enjoy your Lite edition. I can how well it works, because my laptop's fan turns on much less when using your Lite edition compared to regular xp pro. However, I was hope in your next edition, you can add Battery Power indication support as well as East Asian Language support.

And I have a AMD 64 2800+ 1,8 Ghz with 1Gb Ram. 2 things do that I can?t get to work is Media player and BS Player to watch movies. Then my pc hangs.

,Cjhtxgeek,2006-04-17T02:05Z,"Hey, love the distro, stable, fast, and super effecient, was going to resort to norton ghost (had just gottena version the way i like), however yours is better in many areas,

However, I  have one minor question: How do you turn off the message from ""Windows File Protection"" informing me that some critical windows files arent ""official"" (OH NOEZ!), anyway, is there anyway to turn that off?  Thanks in advance, and might as well sorry for my ignorance if its something obvious... Great package though, thanks."
,KbudE,2006-04-17T03:19Z,This is the best version of windows ever!  I especially like how fast it installs and how its automatic with no button pushes.  Having the most recent updates is genius.  All this saves hours worth of time on XP reinstalls.  Keep up the great work.

,x_t_c_27,2006-07-31T21:36Z,to answer my own question lol no it's not possible unless you have an external hardrive because the virtual drive doesn't load until after windows does and it won't run then because you can't run it in win32 :-)

,r0tt3n,2006-12-11T06:51Z,"Anyone having problems with their ieee 1394 firewire modules?  I have observed that on three different machines I've installed this to, that the integrated firewire adapters aren't getting installed properly.  What's worse is that these drivers are supposed to come with windows, so no manufacturers actually make them available on their sites.

Anyone have a solution to this??"
,r0tt3n,2006-12-11T09:55Z,"...also, I've noticed that the Windows Firewall is missing, which is fine assuming it's not somehow in effect even though it is removed.  I have several port forwarding settings which work on several other machines on my network, and used to work on a machine before I installed this on it.  Now I can't get any services on that machine to be visible to the outside world.  I'm really stumped as to how to proceed, since I obviously can't configure something that's not there, and yet, it seems to be blocking incoming connections!!! ARGGHH!!!!  Anyone having this problem, or have a solution?"
,r0tt3n,2006-12-12T00:05Z,"OK - I've done a tonne of research and managed to determine that the problems I was having regarding the firewall missing was related to Windows not liking installing off a CDROM drive that is set to be Slave when there is no master.  See below for details.  Anyways - looks like the problems I was having weren't related to this version of XP Lite :-)

1) Symptom:
XP Install process was freezing during the ""copying files phase"".  By freezing I mean that it got about 10% of the way, and then I could hear the CDROM spinning up and spinning down over and over.
2) Initial Action:
I pushed the eject button, and immediately the ""copying files phase"" ended, and the ""Installing Start Menu Items"" began.
3) Result of Initial Action:
Parts of Windows XP were simply not present.
4) Initial Troubleshooting:
Tried burning the XP image using a different drive, on different media, and then booting using that different drive and different media.
5) Initial Troubleshooting Result:
XP Install failed in the same exact location.
6) Back To The Drawing Board:
I uncovered that sometimes Windows XP doesn't read the CDROM drive is the only drive on a channel, and is not declared as the master, and/or not on the end of if the IDE cable.
7) Solution:
I changed the formerly ""slave"" CDROM drive to ""master"", and re-installed again, and this time the ""copying files"" process did not freeze.
8) Conclusion:
Microsoft is retarded, and the copy of Windows XP Lite 2006 Corporate is completely fine."
,robertneff,2006-12-28T09:20Z,"I have also noticed on several computers that the IEEE 1394 adapters weren't working.  Apparently Windows is supposed to include this driver, which is why you can't download one anywhere.  It looks like it was ripped out of this install.  Anyone have any idea at all how to fix this?  The problem exists whether you have an add-in PCI card or if there are firewire ports on your motherboard.  Even modern NVidia boards with firewire, when you install the driver, the firewire ports show up as ""IEEE 1394 Driver"" with the yellow question mark.  Anyone else experiencing this?  HELP!"

,r0tt3n,2007-05-23T20:23Z,"FYI: If you have a program (such as Quickbooks Pro 2007) that will not run without a working copy of IE, obviously using this version of windows could be problematic.  I have found a solution however.

The main problem is obviously that iexplore.exe is not present, and for whatever reason, trying to install ie6 or ie6 sp1 doesn't work, failing due to the fact that it thinks a newer version of Internet Exploder is already present, even though it isn't.  And obviously this version of will Windows will not pass microsoft's geniune disadvantage test, so you can't download IE7.

However, I just managed to download and install ie7 from this torrent:

And thus, Quickbooks Pro worked.  Hopefully this will help a few people.  Enjoy!."
,r0tt3n,2007-06-29T05:22Z,"As much as I love this version of xp, and will continue to use it for at least another 3-5 years, there are a few other shortcomings that people should be aware of:
1) Firewire (IEEE1394)
Problem: No firewire dll's are present - no idea why these would be removed, but regardless, you can't get any firewire cards to work, and thus, you can't get any devices that use firewire work, without doing the following:

Solution: Go to a normal version of windows xp pro, and do a search for 1394 in the c:\windows folder, and copy every file you find there to your install of win xp lite.

2) Laptop power indicator:
Problem: Like the firewire problem above, for some unknown reason, all of the dll's and important things needed for the power indicator used by most laptops are missing in this version of Windows XP Lite Corp 2006. 

Solution: My solution for this was the same as above, only this time, search for every instance of the word ""bat"" in the c:\windows folder of a working version of windows xp, and copy those into your installation of Windows XP Lite Corp 2006.

3) Internet Explorer
Problem: As mentioned in my last post, internet explorer has been yanked from this version of windows, which is actually a little misleading, as you can open windows explorer and then type in a URI in the address bar and hit enter, and the windows explorer window will change into a replica of Internet Explorer 6 SP1 (I say replica because iexplore.exe doesn't actually exist anywhere, so I don't really know what this is exactly).  In most cases, having no Internet Explorer is fine, except when you have some stupid program that won't run unless you have it.  And, since it appears the removal of internet explorer was a bit messy, all ie6 updaters and removers refuse to work, and IE7 is protected by genuine disadvantage.  Thus, you need:

Solution: The solution I mentioned above, which is to install this hacked version of IE7 found here: http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3548783/Internet_Explorer_7_Final_--_No_WGA___Automated_Install_Package

That's all for now!  Hope this helps."

,DemonicBlood,2007-08-01T12:26Z,"Frogface, I have to say even after a year after you released this (and I first downloaded it) I still love it. I first saw it on a forum and grabbed it, but a little later was forced to reformat when I needed to install something. Now after switching through at least 15 types of XP's, I found yours again :). Hoping I can get it if people still seed this. "

,janlafata,2008-02-21T01:04Z,"frogface...This litttle miracle of yours has worked like a charm for an old computer I am fixing up for an elderly lady. One big question I have though...Should I download any extra windows updadtes or will that mess things up. I definetely don't want Internet Explorer, but some of those updates might want to install it. The reason I know I can download updates and make this creation of yours genuine is I tried it. I downloaded a patch that validates me everytime. I'm espcially wanting the updates so I can improve functionality especially with SP3 coming out. But if you think that will mess things up, I won't download anything. I'm not even sure I can download Windows Updates on Firefox. If not I have the ability to add IE7, if I want it."
