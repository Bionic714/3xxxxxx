This is a fully functional version of XP Corporate. (100% tested) Features and non-features include (but not limited to):

Sick of bloat? read on.

NO help BS.
No "microsoft" windows updates.(MS Updates appears on start menu, just delete it)if you want updates, go to http://www.petri.co.il/   or   http://windowsupdate.62nds.com/   F*ck Bill.
All language packs and support have been removed except for English.
Administrative Tools was added to My Computer, for EZ access.
Numerous other tweaks were added.

I tested this version on a PC with only 256 MB RAM, and it absolutely FLEW!
Has all MS updates as of March 06.

On a side note, this is the perfect OS for the person who uses a second computer for gaming.(after install, xp was only using 100MB RAM!) 

All in all, I reduced a 590MB bloatware piece of sh*t, to a sweet,(295MB) hassle free version of XP.
