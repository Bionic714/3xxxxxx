[V],hebbelille,2006-04-01T12:21Z,more asian shit movies? whats the point to download a movie whit japanese audio and chinese subs if you not are yellow you`re self:p
[V],hebbelille,2006-04-01T12:24Z,but the wiewers can guess what they say in the movie maybe;)
,ZimonDray,2006-04-01T20:25Z,"WTF, is this a joke?
Uploading a bunch of crap when it isnt subbed?
chinese and japanse shit everywhere without nordic sub, fix it!"
,Affenkopf,2006-04-02T09:40Z,"Stop bitching, this is on the top 100 so there are plenty of people who understand and want to see it.
I don't complain about every torrent i don't like."
[V],hebbelille,2006-04-02T12:31Z,"funny thing that this movie is at the top 100 list,downloaded 0 times....funny...."

,ZimonDray,2006-04-02T20:32Z,Not a straight eye shelded man from the bangabanga either.
,wolf359,2006-04-03T15:54Z,What's the problem guys? There's plenty of stuff for the rest of us.Surely we don't begrudge a miniscule piece of PB space for our oriental friends? it's obviously popular anyway :)
,jdmisme,2006-04-04T12:35Z,ya gotta love these idiots that complain about no ENGLISH subs/language when it says in the box AUDIO:japanese SUBS:chinese!  WHAT A BUNCH OF WHINING BIATCHES!!! 
[V],hebbelille,2006-04-04T14:59Z,"haha.....screw head,the reason that i complain its because there are NONE english subs,do you understand fuckbrain?"
,Affenkopf,2006-04-04T18:46Z,"None englisch subs? Funny to hear someone complaining about the lack of Engliush subtitles who does not even seem to be able to properly write in the language.

Have you ever seen the language button at the buttom of the page? TPB is available in more languages than just English so people load up torrents that are not English, if you don't understand it simply don't download it."
[V],hebbelille,2006-04-04T22:16Z,"i write two languages Affenkopf,do you? only english i think? s책 buzz off my english mr perfect;)"

,john170950,2006-05-02T00:19Z,Weird that there are no english subs.  I got this DVD a few weeks ago at adc and it has english subs.
,usagi yojimbo,2006-05-08T11:23Z,"yeah, why get so mad? you ca try getting the subs at other links like kloofy.That's why asians hate westerners because they think they're so great when they are actually the dumb ones!hahahaha!"
