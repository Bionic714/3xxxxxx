What the hell is that about. I am running bittorrent, could that be the prob, or is anyone else getting this message?"

,Jgil,2006-04-26T05:42Z,"i finally gave up on downloading this damn file. I went to isohunt.com, and found it, downloaded very quick too. good luck"
,lysandra,2006-05-11T11:30Z,You people are seriously saying that you won't watch a comedian because of what religion she happens to be?  It's been some time since I've seen something so ridiculous.
,Micolithe,2006-07-21T02:25Z,I'm using uTorrent and I don't get this supposed error.
,Vern666,2007-01-23T05:04Z,"Thank you =Post@L=. I hate these fucking scene releases in 40965 rar parts, but thanks for posting it in the first place. Sarah Silverman is so fucking hot!"
,tomloadus,2007-02-08T11:28Z,"just finished DL'd it and its got no sound, im using THE DivX player but no audio. it is a rar file, if ya know there no sound for me let me know.
good luck
tom"
,tomloadus,2007-02-08T11:47Z,"hey yall i just posted (see above) and said it had no audio... and for some reason no audio played on my official DivX player???
i tried it on my ""VLC Media Player"" and it plays WITH audio... not sure why this is... anyone know why my DivX player aint playing audio. is it some kind of setting im not seeing??

also i played it in full screen and the audio isnt that hot but who can complain$$ know what i mean

also spread the word that this isnt a BLOG site where you express you VIEWS... the comment areas are to inform everyone interested in DLing a particular torrent about is contents and quality. 
SO QUIT ACTING LIKE A BUNCH OF TOUGH BITCHES AND CUT THE DRAMA!
if you feel the same way spread the WORD.
and if you dont like what i said tell me directly by clicking on my name not by taking up more space that others read.

peace
tom"
,tomloadus,2007-02-08T11:49Z,audio in fine on my VLC player its the video thats not to hot
,subliminal_city,2007-03-03T18:22Z,"this girl certainly does NOT know funny, she's not even close to being funny one, single time. Well perhaps with the ""american airlines, first through the towers"" the rest is just bs. her expressions are like a bad bill hicks, same facial expressions and she tries with the same imitations as he did atleast according to my own interpretation of it. 
However, the quality of the rip is good and the sound is good and that's about all the positive things I can say about this."
,joeferrone,2007-06-24T17:54Z,"yea i too am getting the ""got bad file info - path .imdb disallowed fors ecurity reasons""
any suggestions?"
,painful_rectal_itch,2007-10-21T04:56Z,MUSLIMS?!?! YOU MEAN THE DIRTY SMELLY GREASY CAMEL-RIDING SAND TURDS WITH THE MENACING DISPOSITIONS? I LOVE THAT THEY OWN ALL THE MOTELS AND CONVENIENCE STORES IN AMERICA! AT LEAST NOW THE NIGERIANS CAN HAVE A CRACK A CAB DRIVING!
,Kjell16,2008-03-06T05:30Z,seed!
,Abstrakt_85,2008-03-23T20:56Z,"how the fuck did a religious argument develop here? :P Crazy people, why not hate everybody instead? It's simpler, and makes more sense.. Anyway, Silverman rocks!"
