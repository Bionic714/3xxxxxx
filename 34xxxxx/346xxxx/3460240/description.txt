Mac specific:

Quote from mac developer minch: 
This build is fantastic!

Adobe has released a preview version of Macromedia Flash-plugin update for Intel-based Macs. This update is now compatible with Opera. Download is available at: <http://www.macromedia.com/go/2dda3d81>.


Windows specific:

For Windows users, this weekly build is only available in Windows Installer format. If your computer does not yet have the Windows Installer, it can be downloaded from the Microsoft download page.


Windows Installer specific:

Installers are notoriously difficult to set up correctly for all systems, there are just too many different computer setups in the world for us to think of all of them. Anticipating that some of you might find bugs in the installer, we've set the installer to write a local log as it progresses. This log is stored in the file 
install_log.txt
which is placed in the folder where the installer is run from. If you encounter problems while running the installer, we would very much appreciate it if you would file a bug report and provide the log as an attachment. The log will be overwritten if you run the installer twice, so please file the bug report first, and retry afterwords.  If your install goes smoothly, just ignore or delete the log.

Known issues:

(mac) Keyboard shortcuts with "ctrl" as modifier can cause Opera to crash.
(Windows installer) A few files are not removed on uninstall and have to be deleted manually.

This is the Windows Installer if some users with old computers don't have it.

Comments and thanks are appreciated.
