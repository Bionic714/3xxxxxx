,En god man,2006-03-21T06:26Z,"Oh, and you can download it direcly from
http://my.opera.com/community!"
,linsux,2006-04-27T22:18Z,"En god man, the widget thing is more than you can imagine (at least, it'll be - and no I am not trying to convince you to ""hey, it's damn revolutionary"", because, no it's not ;) ). I think bear with Opera, it's more standards compliant (if you mind this detail) and faster. Don't you forget one more thing; Opera is far more professional than Firefox or Mozilla as Opera runs on _any device_, not just on both linsux and winblowz ;)"
