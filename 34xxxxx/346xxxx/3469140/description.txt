Comedy veterans and co-creators Penn Jillette and Paul        
Provenza capitalize on their insider status and invite over   
100 of their closest friends--who happen to be some of the    
biggest names in entertainment, from George Carlin, Whoopi    
Goldberg, Drew Cary to Gilbert Gottfried, Bob Saget, Paul     
Reiser and Sarah Silverman--to reminisce, analyze,            
deconstruct and deliver their their own versions of world's   
dirtiest joke, an old burlesque, too extreme to be performed  
in public, called The Aristocrats.
