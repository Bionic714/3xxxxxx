,Siamesemonster,2006-06-24T17:08Z,Noob right here... how do i open a bit torrent file? and is it ok/better to DL it from limewire?
,mait,2006-07-01T19:51Z,"you need a bittorrent client like... bittorrent(mean and lean) or azureus(kind of bloated, java-based, but more features).

Don't use limewire to download executebles unless you like viruses.

What is wrong with the youth of today? Alot of idiotic comments that you don't need to ask if you fucking read the info on this torrent.

MacBook Pro/OSX 10.4.8"
,morgenes,2007-02-28T01:47Z,"Some guys are talking about that they cant use it, cause of their OS version. Should it be working for me, with my 1.05Ghz, 1024mb ram, iBook?
;)"
,mac_davis,2007-03-27T20:38Z,"I think I remember when I was working with ProTools+Mbox it did the tick, but that was because I didn't have it hooked up right, or the buttons on the Mbox right.

This works great on my iMac 2.33 GHz 10.4.9"

,solivern,2007-06-19T19:49Z,"Why doesn't it install the Rewire engine? No rewire options where they should be + Reason doesn't open as slave after Logic.
What the hell is going on?"
,solivern,2007-06-19T19:50Z,"Oh I forgot to say, I'm running it on an intel core2duo iMac. It was all fine on my old g4."
,solivern,2007-06-21T21:47Z,"ATTENTION INTEL USERS. Version 7.2 does NOT support Rewire on Intel Macs. After downloading and installing 7.2, you should then get the update patch 7.2.1 from Apple website (free)."

,manulove2hate,2008-04-14T15:43Z,Please Seed!! Need to try before I buy..
,mrstain,2008-08-11T09:27Z,"Dear Fellows, Etc.,
I installed 7.2 by unchecking everything; however, I'm pretty sure I need at least the GarageBand update which is included in ""do not check"" list, but cannot install without content disk.  I believe the reason I need the GarageBand update is because when I try to import my GarageBand 08 track into Logic, I am told that I need to update Logic.  This was not solved by installing the available updates for Logic (7.2.1 & 7.2.3), from the apple website.  Any ideas?  happy, and seeding"
,j11ckmelon,2008-12-28T19:22Z,Works fine. Thanks 4 uploading it. In installation it asks for a CD but if you press cancel a few times then the installation quits but the app works fine.
,j11ckmelon,2008-12-29T00:32Z,Won't work on Macbook.
,wizkid515,2009-06-16T17:16Z,Where do I get second disc with the content for Logic 7? I can only find it for Logic 8 and I don't want Logic 8.
