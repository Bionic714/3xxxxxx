,deltArate,2006-09-15T18:35Z,Theres 12 songs just on the haunted mansion ride?
,WH88,2007-10-11T21:22Z,Please seed!!!!!!!!!!!
,(s.i.e),2008-08-22T21:21Z,"dillonhh?
are you able to seed maybe? i can't go further with downloading this track."
,(s.i.e),2008-08-24T16:47Z,"i have it downloaded now, i thought it was from the movie haunted mansion by disney.
i downloaded the wrong track so i can't do much with it:(

it's still nice of you by uploading this though."
,majca,2008-12-01T15:41Z,"Good quality, fast download.  +1"
,majca,2009-05-15T11:20Z,"Everyone, don't forget to seed this - it's only got 3 seeders.  If you're worried about going over your download cap, don't worry - music files are soooo small that you'd basically have to download like, 1000 songs before you'd even make a dent in your cap.
(the average song is 4 MB.  I don't know about you, but I have a 20GB cap.  4 MB * 1000 = 4 GB.  I can't even think of 1000 songs I'd want.)
I understand if you're worried about seeding a tv episode or a game, but with songs there's no excuse! :)"
,majca,2009-05-15T11:43Z,"In case anyone's wondering, here's exactly what you're getting:
1.  Walt Disney
This is a short, 24-second track of the man himself talking about the haunted mansion shortly before it was opened.
2. Welcome
This is a recording from one of the waiting rooms - I don't know which one, as I don't recognize it.  It's got a woman doing the foyer bit, and then the Disneyland Ghost Host doing the doom buggy loading bay spiel.  Maybe this was unused soundtrack, before they decided on the stretching room?  I don't know.
3. Disneyland
The soundtrack of everything you'd hear, from the moment the foyer doors closed to Little Leota on the Disneyland Ride.
4. Walt Disney World
The mansion at WDW is identical to Disneyland, except for one extra bit.  This is that extra bit, only 1 minute 1 second extra.
5. Tokyo Disneyland
For obvious reasons, at Tokyo Disneyland the cast members have the option of having a Japanese Ghost Host narrate the stretching room.  That's what this is.
6. Disneyland Paris
the Phantom Manor is quite different to all the other Mansions; as such, this is the entire soundtrack from foyer to Little Leota (yes, they still have her).
7. The Genius of Paul Frees
The voice of the American ghost host, trying to decide how to say his lines.  Very entertaining.
8. Otherworldly Music
The music playing in the ballroom scene.
9. Sound Effects
The music playing in the Doom Buggy loading bay.
10. Radio Ads
some old radio ads that were run when the Haunted Mansion was first built.  A real hoot!
11. Exit Spiels
All the emergency warning tracks, for if the ride breaks down or something like that.

I hope you downloaders find this helpful!  I would definitely suggets downloading the whole thing, even if you just want the ride track.  the extra stuff is really cool!"
