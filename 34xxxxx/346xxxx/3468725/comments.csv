,brad56,2006-05-08T03:05Z,I can't get the sound to work i have divx 6 it says that the audio is 'ms' stereo where can I get this codec. Preferable a mac version of it would be ideal.

I downloaded Season 4 from Sammern.

,euphoria4949,2011-02-24T19:58Z,"Brilliant season, well there isn't a bad season of the Sopranos is there!

But HQ it is not! I mean if it was played on a SDTV or just a very small HDTV no bigger than a 30"" then it should be better, but on a large HDTV its REALLY poor!
Its very pixelated and a few times is out of sync with the audio. But some people may have lower standards so it might not seem so bad.
But I will still say thanks for the upload, dame I miss The Sopranos...... Still the best TV series ever in my opinion.

VIDEO=5
AUDIO=6
SEASON=10"
