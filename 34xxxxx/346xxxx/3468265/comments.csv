,mariobava,2006-04-09T01:34Z,Thank you so much for putting all this effort in freakyflicks and karagarga! Luv ya 4 this!!
,fle,2006-04-12T14:06Z,"Thanks for uping this. Tarr is a crazy feilm maker but his movies surely have atmosphere.
Say anyone has that monster Satantagngo?"
,samthegoat,2006-04-13T21:22Z,i'd also love to see satantango up here
,euclideanspace,2006-04-14T22:41Z,Is there any way of getting each part on a separate disk? as both parts are over 700mb and I hate watching films on the pc. Thanks
,ornitos,2006-04-17T19:09Z,Thank you for this movie! Now I'm only hoping to be able to get the opportunity to watch Satantango some day too!
,Kath,2006-04-24T20:51Z,"Yeah, this movie is really good but Satantango sure is better. Among the top 5 in the history of the world."
,donsrule,2006-05-19T06:14Z,Please seed this one :)
,jwja,2006-05-22T18:35Z,"I have finished downloading this torrent, but I can't get the subtitles to load in BSPlayer. Is there another player I should be using? Anyone who can help me out, please send me a message. I will be most grateful."
,spyros,2006-05-25T01:12Z,Hello. I've been looking for this movie for a couple of years now. Please keep seeding this. Once I download it I'll keep seeding for quite a few months (which is not much since I have a lousy 128kbps line). But I'll do my best to seed this at least 1k%.
,spyros,2006-07-25T22:22Z,"Still here still seeding ... c'mon folks that was a nice and RARE movie, please keep seeding"
,jacque_jack,2006-08-17T19:26Z,the subs doesn't work on bsplayer :( how do i make it work?
,Okkultus,2006-08-30T23:19Z,Wow!!! I've been looking for this for over a year now! Thanks very much! I hope someone will soon upload Béla Tarr's 2 other masterpieces - Sátántangó and Kárhozat.
,botar,2006-09-22T20:25Z,"Sátántangó was not released on DVD, cause the director does not allow it (being 7.5 hours long it wouldn't be the same adventure as in a theatre), so it's not an easy task to get it here...
you all should go to the next art cinema and demand it to be shown!! :) "
,Beksinski,2006-09-29T02:48Z,"Actually I have a VHS-rip of Satantango but there has been so much hype about the November DVD release that I am going to wait, grab it once it's out and bring it over here to all you good people. :)"
,botar,2006-10-17T11:31Z,"sorry, i was wrong! it's gonna be released soon..."
,wedgedkc,2007-03-11T22:20Z,Thanks!
,Havasip,2007-05-18T15:07Z,One hundred hugs to the persons who seeds this ;)
,stu,2007-06-29T06:43Z,"just watched this ..... so beautiful
thanks"
,monkeystuff68,2007-08-28T13:41Z,"I've got no luck with the subtitles, either. I checked to make sure they have the same name as the associated avi file, but it still doesn't work (in any player: VLC, DIVX...). I tried renaming .sub to .srt, but no player is recognizing them... Help! Is there anywhere one can download proper subtitles files? Did these work for Anyone?"
,monkeystuff68,2007-08-28T14:02Z,"FIGURED OUT THE SUBTITLES PROBLEM: In VLC, run the file from Open File instead of running it automatically, and the program will let you choose the subtitles file. The *.sub will work then!"
,m3th0d,2007-10-19T21:07Z,"Please seed!

,ingles666,2011-07-02T16:54Z,Thank you!
,cinesimon,2011-10-25T08:55Z,"This seems to be overdubbed - not sure if it's supposed to be like that? As in, the actors are speaking something else, and it's been overdubbed during post production??"
,korovjov0,2011-12-13T07:07Z,"@cinesimon: It's because Lars Rudolph (János Valuska) Peter Fitz (György Eszter) and Hanna Schygulla (Mrs. Tünde Eszter) aren't Hungarian actors, so their lines were dubbed for the original release."
