I'm also with you on that bed / bathroom argument. DONT BE TEH CRY PRIMA (that is otherwise known for their sucky, and rushed, mmorpg guides, I think. heh)."

,weepndvl,2009-09-15T19:59Z,"There is one instance of the strategy guide that includes page 330.  Where is it?  On my hard drive, of course.  Go on a quest and you too may find it."
