iFUTURELIST (pronounced "I futurist") is the first original album by Akira Yamaoka, well-known for his work on the Silent Hill and Bemani series. The tone of the album is decidedly electronic, tending more towards his work in the Bemani series, although there are a few acoustic songs, as well as a remix of the Silent Hill 4 song "Your Rain". It also includes a number of long and remixed versions of his work on the beatmaniaIIDX series.
