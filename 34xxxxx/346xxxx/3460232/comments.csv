2. install the first rc3 game, (orginal), then you have to install the rc3 soaked.

3. go to rollercoaster`s official website and download the patch to rc3 soaked.

4. Install it, and put the crack in the folder you have installed the game. The crack`s name is ""RCT3PLUS.exe""

5. run the game, gl & hf."
,oscabat,2007-07-28T19:26Z,"To mount it with Daemon Tools:
1) Download Daemon Tools from daemon-tools.cc and install.
2) Run the program, and you should have the icon in your system tray (it looks like a lightning bolt.)
3) Right-click the icon, select ""Virtual CD/DVD-ROM,"" then ""Set number of devices,"" and make sure it has at least 1 device set.
4) Go back to the ""Virtual CD/DVD-ROM"" menu, and select ""Device **"" (where ** is the number and letter of your device).
5) Click ""Mount Image.""
6) Browse for your .iso file, and select that one.  7) If auto-run is successful, it should boot up automatically.  Otherwise, go to My Computer and double-click on the ""CD"" for Roller Coaster Tycoon 3."

,Zoker99,2007-08-14T15:16Z,"Hello :) By reading all the comments spec KEYONZe comment i have fixed my game.  I will take it step for step . 
1: Download this game 
2: Mount image with some mount program like demon tools (you can download demontools on demons webpage, search on google) Mount image on The rc3.iso file. than it will come up a start menu if it doesn't , go to my computer than cd or the setup icon on the iso or click on the rc3 icon.
3:Install rc3 and stocked
4:after you have install , press up the start menu agian ""their will be some buttons on start menu that says"" play,install,updates,rc3 webpage and so on . If you are on the right place , press button that says rc3s webpage . on the webpage press downloads and after that download update #3.
5: Share the update in map you install the game. Than you install the update (press update icon). It will take long time to update. When it's finish you take the crack (rc3plus.exe) from no-cd  to the place you install the game. After that press icon or start menu and play . :D

I hope this will help , it work for me . if you don't understand wrote you e-mail or msn .

Good luck :D"

,revisionz,2011-03-30T20:16Z,the only fun thing to with Wild is letting the animals loose on the crowd. but I guess the point for the game is to see how many people you can kill.

I just mounted RCT installed with serial. Mounted Soaked no serial required. Mounted wildlife(sounds way wrong) no serial required. Copied crack and loaded up the game it seems to work? 

Is there some weird problem I haven't discovered yet that might happen?"

,heisenberg737,2011-10-22T04:17Z,"If you're having trouble with the auto updater like me and, according to a quick google search, a lot of other people as well, try this install routine:

First off, you are going to need some extra files. Please download and keep those, we'll use them while installing the game.

                (([[[ ADDITIONAL FILES ]]]))

        ([[ File 1 ]])
http://www.gamershell.com/download_11939.shtml

        ([[ File 2 ]])
http://www.gamershell.com/download_11887.shtml

        ([[ File 3 ]])
http://www.gamershell.com/download_11938.shtml

                (([[[ INSTALLATION PROCEDURE ]]]))

        ***Note***
        I am going to assume basic knowledge about mounting images, extracting archives,
        and following setup processes, as well as the software required to do so.

        ([[ 1. ]])
Mount 'RollerCoasterTycoon3.iso' from the torrent folder, let AutoRun guide you through the setup process. Serial is:
xa3d-fwp8-ullk-s7j2-etwn-45ul

        ([[ 2. ]])
Unpack File 1 ('RCT3_ONDISC-UPDATE3_USA.zip'), run 'RCT3_ONDISC-UPDATE3_USA.EXE' and let the installer do its job. Get a cup of coffee/tea if you like, this is gonna take a while ^^

        ([[ 3. ]])
Mount 'RollercoasterTycoon3_Soaked.iso' and click your way through the installer.

        ([[ 4. ]])
Unpack File 2 ('RCT3SOAKED_ONDISC-UPDATE1_USA.zip'), run 'RCT3SOAKED_ONDISC-UPDATE1_USA.EXE' and wait for it to finish updating.

        ([[ 5. ]])
Mount 'RollercoasterTycoon3_Wild.iso', this time, try completing the installer by just using you keyboard for a change :D

        ([[ 6. ]])
Unpack File 3 ('RCT3WILD_ANY-UPDATE2_USA.zip') and run 'RCT3WILD_ANY-UPDATE2_USA.EXE'. By now you'll probably be mindlessly staring at the installer, hoping the next file might finally be the last one.


Alright, we're almost finished! Now, let's apply:

                ([[ THE CRACK ]])

        ([[ 1. ]])
Go to the games install directory. If you haven't changed the default, it should be at one of the following locations, depending on your system architecture:

    [ x86 ]
'C:\Program Files\Atari\RollerCoaster TycoonÂ® 3'

    [ x64 ]
'C:\Program Files (x86)\Atari\RollerCoaster TycoonÂ® 3'

Locate 'RCT3plus.exe' and rename it to 'RCT3plus.exe.OLD' in case you'll ever need the original for running updates.

        ([[ 2. ]])
Unpack 'NO-CD.rar' from the torrent folder and move/copy 'RCT3plus.exe' to the games installation directory.

Enjoy the game!"
