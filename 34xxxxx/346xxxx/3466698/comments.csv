If Bin Laden would be alive he would not care about  any american prescence in Iraq since he just cared about their withdrawl from ""the two holy places"".

This Is what he said (to be found on http://www.gregpalast.com/armed-madhouse-part-i/):

""DECLARATION OF WAR AGAINST THE AMERICANS OCCUPYING THE LAND OF THE TWO HOLY PLACES?EXPEL THE INFIDELS FROM THE ARAB PENINSULA""

Palast:
""The two holy places are Mecca and Medina, and their ?land? is Saudi Arabia. That?s what Osama wanted: U.S. troops out of Saudi Arabia.""

Further:
""Bin Laden issued his demand on August 23, 1996; and on April 29, 2003, the Tuesday before the President was chauffeured by fighter jet onto the deck of the Abe Lincoln, Mr. Bush gave bin Laden exactly what he wanted: U.S. troops sent packing from the Land of the Holy Places.""

The American hatred against Islam and Islam extremist hatred towards ""the big satan"" Is just stupidity because thats what we are taught to think. Try to think for your self and question your local authorities. The world Is not black and white and never will be, no matter how much political leaders want It to be black and white.."
