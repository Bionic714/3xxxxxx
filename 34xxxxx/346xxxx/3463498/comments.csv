,2pac_4ever,2006-04-05T14:14Z,What the fuck??? downloading @ 0 kbs and uploading 200 kbs 
,klearlycanadian,2006-04-06T05:59Z,people should always pay back at least 100% ratio.  I do.  Otherwise how does the bittorrent community continue its high bandwidth

,Zimpan91,2006-04-11T18:40Z,Were do i put the crack?
,sethtopher,2006-04-12T16:56Z,"Ok for you white screen folk:
Update your video card drivers, Oblivion is a new game.

I'll be seeding for a bit so the download should smooth out for a lot of you."
,sethtopher,2006-04-12T16:57Z,"Another thing, once installed the game image has to be either burned to a disc and used for play, or mounted with an emulator such as daemon tools."
,C.Olsson,2006-05-08T16:37Z,"hey... when i click Play, in the launcher, it says put in CD and try again. What should i do? where can i find a crack?"
,sethtopher,2006-05-08T21:03Z,"You dont need a crack...
As is written above, you need to mount the image (using daemon tools, etc) or burn the iso onto a disc"
,C.Olsson,2006-05-08T21:25Z,"Hmm.  Should i mount it in daemon tools before installing?... In that case, im screwed up. i have alredy installed it. 
P.s im pretty new to this"
,C.Olsson,2006-05-08T21:26Z,wtf nvm
,KassuU,2006-05-10T15:16Z,Seed u *******

,jsw40,2007-02-04T17:56Z,"I finished downloading and now I'm seeding but I don't know what to do from here... I open it up and I get two folders. One has an SFV file and a WinRAR archive, the other just has a WinRAR archive.

What do I do? Do I extract all the files into one folder? I have Alcohol 120% for burning but I don't know what to burn.

I'd like to keep seeding but I'm going to stop unless I can figure it out or get some help..."
,jsw40,2007-02-04T19:50Z,"Okay, I figured it out.

First, I extracted all the files into my own made Oblivion folder (Not sure if this step is necessary). 

Then, I ran Alcohol 120% and burned the ISO to a DVD disc, and ran the install.

The game works like a charm! Seeding now."
