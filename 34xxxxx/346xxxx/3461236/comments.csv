,stoatsandwich,2006-04-28T19:18Z,"What are the chances of getting the new Tome of the Watchtowers MtA .pdf? (I have a non-broken WoD Chicago you can add, too, if you want.)"
,Goratrix,2006-05-01T10:52Z,"stoatsandwich: the Tome of the Watchtowers is available at chaos-wasteland.dyndns.org. The tracker is currently down, but that should be sorted in a few days.

Is your copy of Chicago really complete? The one that is out there is missing pages 31-32. If yoy really have a full copy, please visit the forum here: http://chaos-wasteland.enlightning.de, and talk to Damador, he can upload it there."
,artech_guy,2006-05-04T11:52Z,Awsome Dude. Hope you get some of the newer books that have just come out soon.
,artech_guy,2006-05-04T13:04Z,"Also, I tried that link that was given for the new Tome of the Watchtowers book, but all I got was a Page Cannot Be Displayed error. What am I doing wrong?"

,blessedwisdom,2006-10-08T18:49Z,Having a problem. Says the file length is too long and won't download. I would love someone to help...
,moitan,2006-10-12T05:16Z,"If anyone is interested, I have maaany e-books in PDF format. Only problem is they're locked. So you can't do special printing such as booklet, but you CAN print them the hard ass way by selecting this page and that page to make the proper folds. . if you're that anal. Otherwise, I reccomend just setting the printer to print odd pages first, then flip over you stack of papers and print the even pages and find something to do in the meantime besides watching the document print. . . "
,moitan,2006-10-12T17:19Z,I'm having problems downloading. . Anyone familiar with the error: Critical: Short read - something truncated files?

As an aside, I have been searching everywhere for a free download of the new Vampire the Masquerade 20th anniversary edition, but I cannot find one ANYWHERE!  Does anyone know where I can get a free copy of the V20 pdf, or have one they'd be willing to upload here at TPB?  I'd seed that fucker for the next six months if they did.  Thanks."
