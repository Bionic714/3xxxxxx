,eggewert2,2006-03-21T09:28Z,"Their 2 best albums. Superb they are, indeed! But if it's true the guys were heorin abusers during the sessions it kind of takes some of the pleasure out of the listening. Don't forget that Spirit of Eden is available as perfect stereo SACD as well. The quiet and simultaneously intense despair is accompanied by the calmness and stability of the DSD sound."

,Electrish,2010-09-14T06:35Z,"Thanks for the upload (although I've got no need for it personally). Can you verify that these two albums did have anything to do with heroin? As I understand it, some newspaper once printed that Hollis was a junkie and he served them a successful lawsuit. Apparently his (late?) brother (Ed?) is/was a junkie and so he didn't take too kindly to the allegation.

So, can you verify that at all or is it a bit of a rock n roll legend?

Anyway, I don't mean to be a prig about things. I think the upload is great and thank you for helping people get their hands on such great music (not just this torrent but across your other uploads as well)."
