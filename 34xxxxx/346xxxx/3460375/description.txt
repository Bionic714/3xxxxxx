Talk Talk - the 2 heroin albums [UK IMPORTS] 192 kbps

The 80's group Talk Talk indulged in 2 legendary and exclusive heroin-induced studio sessions that resulted in the albums "Laughing Stock" and "Spirit of Eden."  They seem to defy genre, but are rife with jazz licks and pre-shoegaze haze the likes of which are addictive like nothing else you've ever heard.  They go in and out of print and are hard to find outside of the UK, so snag it now-- these albums are FANTASTIC!
