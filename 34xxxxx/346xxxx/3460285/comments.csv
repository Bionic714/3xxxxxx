Extras included or ripped?"
,TrolleFar_68,2006-03-21T01:56Z,"Oops, forgot to include the info. It's in PAL, complete with menus and extras"
,alt-gr,2006-04-21T06:51Z,"A great movie... this one is though for some weird reason in 4:3 ratio. Maybe re-encoded and accidentally selected ""convert to 4:3""?
Qval is also not one of the best, one should always use all the space available in DVD5.
Does anyone have this series in scenerelqval with nordic subs? Would appreciate greatly!"
,pflagger,2008-05-18T02:03Z,Yeah I wish this shit was in 4:3 before I downloaded it.  Why can't people just write the fucking info?
,barton101,2012-08-07T15:56Z,"Next time, please include English subtitles for the hearing impaired. They are also good for people who don't have English as their first language. Subtitles take up hardly any extra space and they make for more seeders because the torrent is useful to more people."
