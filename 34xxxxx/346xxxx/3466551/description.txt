SUBSPECIES MOVIE SOUNDTRACK 320KBS - VAMPIRE/GOTHIC/HORROR/ROMANIAN MUSIC

This is a quality MP3-rip of the original Subspecies Sountrack.

For those of you that haven't seen the film, it is this one: 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103002

It's a cheap Vampire/Gothic B-horror-movie, released on VHS in the 90s by Full Moon Productions, that most horror- and gorefans should know by now. It's actually an underground classic and was recently released as a 5-Disc DVD Box Set.

The score is dynamic; it carries Romanian folk music, dark ambient, gothic piano strokes, horror effects....the list could be made long. Overall it is an absolutely wonderful soundtrack, fitting well to the film. Performed by Romanian Aman Folk Orchestra, Richard Kosinski and Michael Portis.

I could recommend this soundtrack to all true horror fans out there - but I won't bother. All people that have seen the film KNOW what I'm talking about. It is very rare to come by these days, I think it's more or less impossible to find it to a decent price on CD. This MP3 release was grabbed from the ED2K network many years ago, and still seems to float around, although carrying very few sources at hand. 

I wanted to release this soundtrack as a torrent, to make it widespread for the last time, before it will sink down into complete unknown-ness. The MP3s have been re-tagged using CDDB and archived using (solid) ACE compression with recovery record, to keep the data intact and avoid letting it become corrupt on filesharing networks with low hashing-techniques (FastTrack etc). 

So here it is - the complete soundtrack for Subspecies - ENJOY!
