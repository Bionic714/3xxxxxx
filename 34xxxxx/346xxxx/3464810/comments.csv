,stuffer,2006-04-01T10:57Z,Correct IMDB link: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0085780/
[T],Beria00,2006-04-01T12:53Z,"En riktigt trevlig film av Michael Mann han som resigserade urfilmen om Dr. Hannibal Lecktor, Manhunter. Precis som i alla Mann filmer så är det bra musik, i denna film så är det Tangerine Dream som han gjort musiken, Klaus Schulze (före detta trummis i Tangerine Dream) var inblandad i musiken i Manhunter. Att rekommendera till er som gillar tidig 80-tals horror...."

,bsdman64,2007-04-03T11:54Z,"I am in auwe.. I saw this the year after it was released on Satalite Dish. Ay that time the LNA angles were either 120 or 160. I think my dad had the 120 - we could get EVERYTHING on the satilites. Different feeds of ALL of NFL and most of College football. That was BEFORE encryption! What A great! find. I've been looking for this for awhile.
Thank you Sooo much!

Please keep seeding, I'm @ 0% and gaining"

,bsdman64,2007-04-03T12:02Z,"I think alot of Michael Mann. He has some verydetailed story to tell when he does a film. I suspect he would be a control freak. Because it's in his mind what he wants, and there is no comprimises; Music, Cameras, Digital, Ambiance and sets...
Can you tell I like his movies and that ""little thing"".. what was it..., Oh! yea Miami Vice.
Hans Zimmer (help here, I think it was)

This is without a doubt a moral movie meets a predecessor to DOOMx!"
,Wigan_Pie,2007-05-23T20:13Z,"Can anyone please help and seed this - I'm stuck at 80%.

Many thanks. "

If I can down load this I'll sead it for a month.

secondly;
I can finally throw out my VCR, this move is the only reason I keep a VCR under the bed!

afterthought
why to this day this is not no BR or DVD is still beyond me. I swear they have lost the original. I email the studio about everyother month and still have yet to received a reply. I suggest others do the same."
