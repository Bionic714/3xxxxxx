Did you copy over the contents of the crack folder?"

,Dead-Inside,2006-04-11T15:11Z,"This is just a demo....... The ""crack"" isn't working. A key would be more helpful."

,stizZle,2006-05-08T17:46Z,"Have found a keygen that works, found it with bearshare!"

,NoneGiven,2007-03-07T04:29Z,The crack in the torrent works just fine; it's the directions that suck. After you copy the files you will be prompted to register. You can put anything at all in for the registration code and the game will accept it. No need for a separate keygen.
,John Zim,2007-06-13T08:53Z,Classic game; the crack works fine. Thanks.
,ScoKai,2007-11-26T21:25Z,"I have no idea how to get this to work. I've installed the game, but then when it comes time to register. I'm lost help me out please"
