,=michael=,2006-03-28T22:20Z,could you give all the other links of the dvd's you already have uploaded i couldnt find them thanks!!!
,Goethemola!,2006-03-29T01:42Z,"I don't remember all the links, sorry. We upload to different trackers. I think in Pirate Bay are 2 or 3. You can find ALL the movies in www.dvdquorum.es. The site is in spanish, but you can post in english without problems. 
Maybe, if you write my nick in the search engine of Pirate, you can find my uploads here in Pirate Bay."

,vinryk,2006-04-01T12:07Z,"Could you please upload Valley of Gwangi again?
I love that movie."
,Goethemola!,2006-04-02T17:22Z,"Well... Jeje!
If you take a look, we don't upload the valley og Gwangy, because this mobie is not edited yet in spanish.
So, if anybody can upload this one, be sure that here is a grateful downloader."
