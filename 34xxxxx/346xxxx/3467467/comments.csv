,sunwaley,2006-10-15T10:44Z,tack för bra program. inga struliga installationer eller virus. försökte med cs2 här men //¤#!!# vad de krånglar........
,Orla_x,2006-12-03T09:52Z,"Can more people seed this please?
Mine's stopped at 12.9%.
And I like 7.0, it simple but effective and so easy to use.
And CS2 isn't a finished product, and uses up a ton of memory."
,Dizztah,2006-12-12T19:56Z,ffs The Serial Key IS NO WHERE!
