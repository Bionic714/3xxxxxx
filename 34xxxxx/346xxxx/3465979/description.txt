This is a streamed webcast (about 1 hour) of Leela James performing at the North Sea Jazz Festival in 2005.


Don't gimme no crap about quality ( what do you expect of a stream ;) ), you either like it or not. And I bet you do cause you would not download it if you are not a fan of this great soul artist.
