,bigmagicdog,2006-04-06T22:58Z,"Gene Pitney was a gentleman. I had the pleasure of interviewing him several years ago, for a radio programmme, when he was in South Wales. I asked him what he thought his most embarrasing moment was and he smiled and replied that on one gig he misjudged the edge of the stag due to the footlights and whilst performing walked of the edge of it and landed in orchestra pit, which fortunately was not a long drop. He continued '...I split my pants but I still came up singing........' he laughed.
Gene Pitney was and will always be remembered as a gentleman.

Gene Pitney was one of the greatest artists of the 60's and a fantastic songwriter as well. My favorite song of his has to be ""Only Love Can Break a Heart"". Very sad, he will be missed..."
