Speak And Spell (Remastered 2006)
1) Standard Audio CD Layer Stereo in LOSSLESS format (Not the SACD layers!)
2) The full DVD rip"
,macrovision,2006-04-06T05:39Z,"all I know is that MP3 presents you a million artifacts incorporated into the record. That's why we're shouting here requesting the LOSSLESS rips for this one and more. Well... this is not the original version, the remastered version is much louder, with treble busted, it sounds good as well... not a real big deal. But the DVD Rip will be very interesting since it holds 5.1 mixes."
,macrovision,2006-04-06T05:43Z,but to definitely answer your question... it might be that the previous rip you had had reverse stereo turned on your soundcard.
,macrovision,2006-05-14T22:10Z,"rezidue: Updating. Yes, the versions are swapped. The OLD CD has got Puppets that way, while the NEW REMASTERED has got the stereo reversed. Don't know why that, but I hope that was for the better. "
