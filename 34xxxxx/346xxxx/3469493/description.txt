One of today?s hip-hop and cultural icons, Snoop Dogg (?Starksy & Hutch?) stars in this year?s remarkable musical drama, BOSS'N UP, coming to DVD on December 6, 2005 from Snoopadelic Films, and CodeBlack Entertainment. Inspired by the music from his platinum album, ?Rhythm & Gangsta, this feature stars Snoop as Corde, a broke and frustrated grocery clerk who wants out of his dead-end job. Possessing a supreme ability to persuade the opposite sex, Corde realizes his calling when a veteran of the pimp game unexpectedly visits and shows him how to generate serious cash off his untapped talent. With the girl of his dreams on his arm, he takes a voyage into the dangerous lifestyle of prostitution, money, and murder. Corde soon learns that all that glitters is not gold and must choose between the downward spiral of the fast-life and the self-realization of whether he is a pimp or a man. The dynamic ensemble cast includes Hawthorne James (?Five Heartbeats!?) as Corde?s mentor in the pimp life with supporting roles by Larry McCoy (?Malcolm X?), hip-hop recording artist/producer Lil? Jon, and newcomer Shillae Anderson. The DVD is packed with entertaining bonus features and previously unreleased songs that viewers will enjoy long after the credits roll.
