PLOT

Among normal humans live the "Others" possessing various
supernatural powers. They are divided up into the forces of light
and the forces of the dark, who signed a truce several centuries
ago to end a devastating battle. Ever since, the forces of light
govern the day while the night belongs to their dark opponents. In
modern day Moscow the dark Others actually roam the night as
vampires while a "Night Watch" of light forces, among them Anton,
the movie's protagonist, try to control them and limit their
outrage.
