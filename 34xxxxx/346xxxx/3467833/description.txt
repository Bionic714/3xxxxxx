This is a excellent choice for anyone who likes to listen to different types of music. I highly recommend this cd since it carries all the sentimental value of Nepali music. One of the best CD in Sur Sudha's entire history of music creation, I think. I own it, I love it, I play it very often. Go and just buy one, seriously you will not regret it. It has Sitar, Tabla and flute.
