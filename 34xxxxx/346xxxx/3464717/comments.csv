,moerdarh,2006-04-09T22:24Z,"Actually I think this kind of music works pretty well in 128 kb/s, but when it comes to metal and good stuff like that, you need higher bitrate"
,Audioslaver,2006-04-16T00:14Z,You should have added some b-sides in here 2;) but great upload tough..
,zeek2freak,2006-04-20T00:12Z,"great upload, I've been looking for coldplay everywhere! thanks again! =)"
,nighthowler,2006-04-24T22:58Z,no... 128 is to low for all music
,harvinator,2006-05-08T21:53Z,"god i hate coldplay so much,it makes me want to slash my wrists,im feeling a bit suicidile right now so i thought i would download it now so i can push myself over the edge,goodbye cruel world."
,xnataliexnx,2006-05-14T16:08Z,"coldplay are the best =) 

to the random at the very bottom. . .

kill yourself listening to 'rubbish' music.

not coldplay. . . top class band =)"
,liejoek,2006-05-22T19:46Z,"128 is more than enough, I'm already having problems getting all my music on my iPod. If you want real quality, just buy the damn cd, it's not like they're that expensive."
,Drawer,2006-08-11T13:45Z,"Come on, please seed. Im on 99.7!"
,sonnymd,2006-08-26T23:07Z,"If you think 128kbits/s doesn't meet your needs, then go buy the albums. Beggers can't be choosers. There's too many of you tools on here complaining all the time."
,Viccce^^,2006-10-13T19:07Z,"I can't start download this torrent, it says that it can't find the page :("
,Rbarba23,2006-11-05T05:42Z,You know how I know you're gay? 
,Malcolm--Edge,2006-12-23T08:10Z,You listen to Coldplay
,V3nomJohnny,2007-07-02T07:13Z,"I agree, wtf with visiting this torrent anyways?"
,azalkmaar,2007-10-31T20:06Z,please keep on seeding!!!
,Welcometothetruth,2008-05-24T23:21Z,hmm... a 128Kbs isn't really all that great in the first place
,zibra,2008-05-25T14:13Z,seed pls:D
,Kubo7,2009-02-11T21:14Z,"128 does usually suck. Its not difficult to rip @ 256 or w/e. Click of a button, that's why its so frustrating to see 128 or lower.... "
,Kneeon,2009-06-05T11:46Z,"If you haven't got a powerful computer or want to have lots of albums on the computer and space is an issue, then you have to sacrifice quality.

If you don't like it, buy the album. In fact, if you do like it, buy some of the albums and support the band *simples*"
,siennadry,2010-09-01T02:12Z,"there seems to be something wrong with ""don't panic"" (the first track on parachutes). it doesn't sound bad exactly, but the lyrics are sped up in places."
[V],protoyu,2011-03-03T17:12Z,"MOTHERFUCKERS AN FUCKING AUDIO CD IS ENCODED AL""FUCKIN""WAYS @ 128FUCKIN KBPS.
MAKING THE BITRATE DOES NOT INCREASES THE QUALITY JUST THE SIZE.
