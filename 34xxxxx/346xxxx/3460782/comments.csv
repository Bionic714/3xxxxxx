FREE THE WAREZ AND PASS IT ON and pass it on with the speed you have not the speed you wanna share it on!!

WANKER!!"
,kybernoidis,2006-03-22T02:50Z,"Soo F.T.W, warez should be free, we should freely share it, but I shouldn't be free to use my internet connection the way I want it? Doesn't sound like true freedom, ei?

(Normally I'd be bored to answer to the millionth comment of this kind, but I just felt like it)."
,Hednoize,2006-04-03T13:58Z,"F.T.W
What about those people that have low bandwith? perhaps they want to be able to talk on the mic or play a game without lag while they are downloading or uploading?
I can't upload anything to anyone anytime without this.. cause i'm always playing and/or talking on the mic. With this I don't have to turn off downloads and uploads.."
,joaco,2006-04-18T07:56Z,"thanks, i was lookin for it!

i dont know why do you fight. if you need it, use it. if you dont, dont use it! its very easy, dont you think?"
,RaGeuk,2006-04-18T15:06Z,I'm downloading it to cap my download....did you think of that?
[T],olirc,2006-04-19T00:11Z,Why dl this? Because i´m gon´a use VOIP and my newly bought router doesn´t have QoS that´s why!
,muntbucket,2006-05-24T08:58Z,"F.T.W.

I share an ADSL connection with two flatmates - they'd cut my bollocks off if used up all our upload bandwidth, and that doesn't mean just capping my torrents.

btw 
you are a cock

cheers"
,asdasd123123,2007-06-04T14:36Z,"Well maybe people have some shoddy fucking ADSL like me, and uploading causes internet to stop working?

Can't browse, check email, most pages I have to reload several times to even GET THERE, and this is the only provider we can get."
,brullo,2007-06-11T00:38Z,does this one work on vista  ?
