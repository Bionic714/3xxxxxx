,rofocales,2009-06-09T09:04Z,The English subtitles provided with this do not work properly - they stop working a few minutes before the end of CD1 and do not work with CD2. To fix this use VirtualDub (it is free) to join them together. Then go to http://www.opensubtitles.org/en/subtitles/216379/shinlaui-dalbam-en for in-sync subtitles. A guide to using VirtualDub can be found at http://www.afterdawn.com/guides/archive/virtualdub_join_avi.cfm.
,rofocales,2009-06-09T09:42Z,"Ah, forgot to mention that during the first part the subtitles are -2/10 of a second out of sync. In VLC this can be corrected by clicking File>Open File>Advanced Settings>Then set the delay box to -2. "
