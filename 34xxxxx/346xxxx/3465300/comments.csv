,wankan,2006-04-06T18:24Z,Rar's are showing invalid or corrupt authenticity information . 
,Salustius,2006-04-07T09:58Z,"If you extract sideI.part1 Winrar outputs errors, but creates an avi that plays well in WMA. Ditto for SideII.part1. 

The problem arises, perhaps because the Anc.Bay DVD has Closed Captions, and the encoder used does not cope with them."
,strategics_f1,2006-12-13T17:06Z,please seed the torrent
