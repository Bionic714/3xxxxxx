,Jezpuh,2008-02-03T23:35Z,"also, first 2 episodes so far were horribly synced. like some parts were normal, some parts needed an audio delay of 2 seconds, other needed a delay of -2. :("
,Maxinebadenhop,2008-06-09T17:22Z,"Hey you guys are awesome !  I missed series 3 and 4 and have managed to find them here on Pirate Bay only - am busy downloading them so hopefully all is well and I get square eyes from watching so much tv in one go!  Living in Asia, there is a distinct lack of decent TV !

Cheers!"

,jopopsicle,2008-06-29T16:07Z,"To The Dumbshit who's complaining.

You wanna get the whole season, go buy the friggin dvd. If you're gonna get it free, don't shit on it. You haven't uploaded shit. So i wouldnt'be talkin if i were you."
,greylion,2008-10-13T20:58Z,"To the fugly dumbshit known as jopopsicle: If someone puts up a torrent, they should at least name the torrent after what it contains, which in this case is NOT the whole season."
,Krystiny03,2009-01-19T02:49Z,"Please Seed!!!
