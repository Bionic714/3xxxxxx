,Erica15jr,2006-09-30T00:09Z,"Good quality, the only problem is that when I try to burn it on a dvd, it is never finished. You can see the movie played on a little screen while you are burning it, but when the movie has finished, the burning stops never and there is not anymore progress. If I take the dvd then out of the cd/dvd-station and I put it in a normal dvd-player, they say there is nothing on it. What's the matter with it? I didn't have these problems with other movies"
