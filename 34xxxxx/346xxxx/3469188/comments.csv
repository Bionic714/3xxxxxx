,pether,2006-04-10T22:51Z,Is this one better then Action Replay?
,ropsu,2006-04-11T06:00Z,Hell no
,globalwar,2006-04-11T17:20Z,"It depends on the game whether its better or not. Better for some games, not as good for others. One thing this has over Action Replay, This can be ran from MC, HDD or USB. And its cracked with all CD, HDD and USB checks removed."
,Xtremevillan,2006-04-11T22:39Z,"One question, I have Swap Magic + Flip Top. Will this make my drive eject? The old one does that, if this one does, screw it."
,pether,2006-04-11T22:47Z,"I burned this, and it didnt start on my PS2.
Stops after the PS2 Logo.

So i'll stick with AR...



And how do you run it from MC?"
,globalwar,2006-04-12T01:05Z,"Xtremevillan:
No clue about the drive ejecting, I have a new SlimLine PS2TWO, no way to test it. You should install the exploit or use swapmagic (if you have SwapMagic 3 or up) and boot it from the MC to test."
,globalwar,2006-04-12T01:07Z,"pether:
Im just guessing, but sounds like a bad burn. I also have no way to test this as im out of blank CDs (i downloaded the ISO myself, so im not 100% sure it works SORRY!). I boot the ELF from USB and it works fine."
,globalwar,2006-04-12T01:12Z,"SwapMagic v3 and up will boot ELFs from a MC, even on the SlimLine PSTWOs (check the swapmagic website).

Heres a website with info about installing and using the exploit (PS2 version 1-10 only).

,Sheytan,2006-07-30T17:24Z,"Have anyone successfully burnt the ISO?

I can't get the ISO to boot"
,Gabe252,2006-10-20T14:16Z,"works 100% boots fine. use a good quality cd if it's not working for you. has alot more codes than action replay.

Auto Eject can be disabled in the options menu."
,mnx1024,2006-11-12T00:34Z,"I have a modded PS2(regular, not slim). May someone please tell me step by step on how to get the codebreaker to work.
I tried 2 method, I burned  only the iso file(codebreaker) and the iso and the elf file, but none of them seems to work. Please help me get this to work. Thanks in advance.

[T],J-Hal,2008-03-30T11:57Z,"Do not work for me,
Regular old PS2.
Magic 3.1 chip.
Good quality media.
I get a red screen or not boot at all."
,furtherdown,2008-05-01T17:08Z,"DOES NOT WORK ON ALL MODCHIPS!  I recall reading somewhere that it was made for those lucky enough to have DSM4 chips.  I wouldn't bother with it.  Get this one instead:

,GoldenAlchemist,2008-05-17T00:25Z,"This will never work. Because you need a modded PS2 to load a ISO Burnt disk. But Codebreaker PS2 isn't compatible with modded PS2s. The staff of cmgsccc confirmed that. 

This is a waste of time and HDD space."
,furtherdown,2008-05-18T10:06Z,"That's why they CRACKED the original CodeBreaker, as it says quite obviously in the title of this torrent.  It works, just not with all modchips.  Don't give people false information and don't talk when you don't know what you're talking about."
,HopeAndApathy,2008-06-02T18:15Z,"If any one is looking for Codebreaker because AR and ARMax doesn't have the cheats they want, which is just like AR. AR peeps are lazy or something and dont seem to make many cheats for any games or useless ones. You can convert Codebreaker Codes to AR by useing some programs, just Google CB2crpt v1.3 and MAXConvert v0.71 These programs work great and you can just use your AR to play why useing the Codebreaker Codes. Hope that helps"
,locknload6,2008-07-01T17:22Z,do i just burn the .elf file to a disc and pop it in my ps2?
,y2jericho17,2009-06-07T13:23Z,Do you need a modded Ps2 to read this ?
,YxKiLL,2010-11-30T01:47Z,hit me up if u need help with this
,dreamchaser89,2011-03-29T13:18Z,"Thanks for share it, i'm going to try to run it on an emulator, i hope it goes well :)
