,d4nnyboy5,2008-04-09T23:16Z,"from these comments its sounds like it works just fine, for those who dont want to install anything just follow these instructions:

start menu/run/ type ""regedit"" and press enter,
this will take you to the registry editor

now follow this directory:
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/Software/Microsoft/WindowsNT/CurrentVersion/WPAEvents

when you get to WPAEvents in the righthand collum there should be ""OOBETimer"" 
right click it and go to ""modify""
Change the numbers in there to :

FF D5 71 D6 8B 6A 8D 6F d5 33 93 FD (this works with windows xp home and pro, both 32 and 64bit versions)

when you've entered them right click on the file ""WPAEvents"" and go into ""permissions""

in there highlight ""SYSTEM"" and underneith it check the two boxes under ""deny"" and click ""OK""

Phew thats it!!! i know it looks comlicated but a compitant novice should be able to follow
these instructions!

i tried this when i used up the amount of times you can activate windows xp, it worked a treat!"

,spittykitty,2008-06-24T21:10Z,"Ok, I ran this for a month and then the dreaded ""you have x number of days to register"" appeared. I thought all was ok until it got to 0 days and locked me out :(

But when I would hit yes, activate now, it would say that this product was already activated. And then it would take me back to the original screen.

I did the following steps, and now it is working again, with no activation warning. I think step 1 is necessary to reset windows to its original activation state. It didn't work otherwise.

1.
""start menu/run/ type ""regedit"" and press enter,
this will take you to the registry editor

now follow this directory:
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/Software/Microsoft/WindowsNT/CurrentVersion/WPAEvents

when you get to WPAEvents in the righthand collum there should be ""OOBETimer""

2. Press F8 while windows is booting, go into safe mode. Then re-apply the antiwga crack provided.

I don't know what went wrong, whether it was a windows update that screwed it up or what, but this fixed it for me. I hope this works for you. 

New downloaders: this still seems to be the best way of getting XP activated, even with this minor hicup. Good luck.

I'm looking for ""spittykitty"", because in the commentary he had made last ""2008-06-24"" described exactly the same problem I'm having right now. 

The difference is that I don't know which wat the crack I installed 30 days ago. The problem happend to my mother that she's living in another country. I personally think that giving the right directions to someone who understand a little more about average computer knowledge can help me a lot to both my mother and I.

I'm writting to you because I don't understand how did you do the ""1"" step. I mean is just impossible, at least to me, to clik on """"start menu/run/ type ""regedit"" ...""

,johnsdre,2009-08-22T20:10Z,am I supposed to wait 30 days for the activation keys to go away or should they have gone away once I installed the crack? I using media center.
,Matora,2009-09-05T21:37Z,"So. I download this, run it. 
Then i wait for the 30 days to run up.

then it should be like 
""Windows is already activated"".

Right?"
,Matora,2009-09-09T03:13Z,"So....I followed the advice on page 2, going into the registry and changing it.
It worked at first, the windows activation window said that windows was already activated.

But now every time i log on, it says ""Lets activate Windows"", and the activation window pops up again. When i click to activate, it says Windows is already activated. Then logs me off.

So its an endless cycle.
And I cant do anything. 
What can I do?
Help please!
Help."
,East Lansing,2009-10-17T02:37Z,"Here's the situation. I download this and ran it.  No messages, no problems for a while.  Then after about a month I started getting the windows activation nag message on boot, with countdown.  Do I want to activate?  Yes/No.  6 days left.  5 days.  4 days.  Now the countdown is at 3 days.  
Whether you pick Yes or No, on the next screen you find out that you are already activated.
So either I'm fine, and just have one more annoyance when booting up, or I'll be locked out in 3 days.  We will see."
,thesuperuberviewer,2009-10-31T02:45Z,"You're going through the same thing I went through, by the time you're reading this, I assume you were locked out.   I wish I had found you sooner so I could've warned you."

I just hope it lasts! If it does... You are da man! Thanks dude!"
,niittor,2009-12-22T14:29Z,"I can't remember which one it is, but one of Microsoft's updates makes the computer verify if it is WGA (Windows Genuine Authentication). Most people don't know how that be default (as well as very persistently) Windows XP has a nasty habit of auto-downloading and auto-installing without asking. It's like that upon the initial installation, it nags the hell out of you about your computer not being setup that way and it sometimes *from my own experience* has turned itself on. That last one was probably from a Microsoft Update though... in my own opinion, here's what you should do:

1. get vista, windows 7 or linux (free BSD)
2. activate xp and look into the updates thing
3. setup your own WSUS server to ""push"" updates **this can also ""authenticate"" OS' for authenticity**
4. don't have xp hooked up to the internet
5. don't use Windows Updates


###Important - if you by chance you get the whole ""Your version of Windows may not be valid crap, just unhide system files, do a search for *.wga files, delete them and reboot###

Enjoi!"

,weasel5i2,2010-03-03T01:28Z,"@sushicat: I just did that. Using WinImage, I made a floppy and put these antiWPA files on it, then just mounted that in Virtual PC (or VMWare if that's what you use) and just boot the VM in safe mode and it worked perfectly!

I put an .IMA file containing the contents of this torrent on my website if you need it:

A similar activation crack works fine except that you can no longer use Safe Mode once
you've installed it, somethin' about Windows being able to tell it's been tweaked with.
