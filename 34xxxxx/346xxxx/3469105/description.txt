 The online edition of Global Rhythm magazine from New York gives review of the album ┬½Ivo i Mara┬╗.
Tom Pryor says:┬╗The group achieves a raw and intense sound by combining the lijerica (a traditional knee-violin, ably played by Ivo Letuni?) with African djembes and traditional bagpipes. Add in Novakovic?s passionate vocals and some discreet techno flourishes, and it?s a winning recipe that finds just the right balance between innovation and tradition.┬╗
