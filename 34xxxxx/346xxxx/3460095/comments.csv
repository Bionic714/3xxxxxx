,dixon1,2007-04-14T01:10Z,"guys, i registered just for this torrent.
Just tested, it's a great program, does everything you need, hotkey to bring up hidden app (which hotkey is changeable) and it really is hidden.  gets past mcAfee.

in response to some other posts about actually cracking it(otherwise it won't truly hide itself unless it is registered or cracked) you have to unhide the folder where it installs under 

C:\WINDOWS\system32\CTF

to unhide them on XP 
  1. open your hard drive (c:)
  2. at the top of the window go to tools.
  3. go to folder options.
  4. click on the tap ""view""
  5. click on show hidden file types and folders

now you will be able to see the ctf folder.

also, when copying the serial.key file and the ctfmon.exe file make sure your program is not running (bottom right hand screen icon)
right click and close it, then copy the files and then click on the ctfmon.exe file that you just copies, it is now running again and set your options and hide it
(for god's sake don't click on register)

~thanks multii~

craigdallie is a special breed of n00b, one that likes to think he has a brain cell but lacks his own, if his comments on other torrents are anything to go by...

and miro-g, i suggest you avoid using torrents altogether, since most of them are probably illegal and use illegal methods of cracking/patching, to which commercial programs are trained to sometimes identify as something bad. if you can't see that a keylogger would be identified as a bad program, then you should just power down now and go back to pen and paper."

,xcor,2008-08-01T07:15Z,"alright guys its very very simple. this contains no virus or spyware. its just the logger your virus protection is detecting.

in order for anything to work you need to turn off your virus protection or it wont let you access the setup (if your virus protection is any good)

the setup is very self explanitory if you just follow the steps given in the comment. 

this does actually work but only on the computer you download it to so you cant get any logs from other computers. hence the whole family logger thing. "
