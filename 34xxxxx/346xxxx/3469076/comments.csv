,miicard,2006-09-27T15:33Z,"WARNING: 

This is NOT the entire season 2. 

Campared to TV.com episode guide ( http://www.tv.com/greys-anatomy/show/24440/episode_listings.html?season=2&tag=nav_bar;2 ) this is the correct episode numbers:

201 -> 110
202 -> 111
203 -> 112
204 -> 113
205 -> 201
206 -> 202
207 -> 203
208 -> 204
209 -> 205
210 -> 206
211 -> 207
212 -> 208
213 -> ---
214 -> 209
215 -> 210
216 -> 211
217 -> 212
218 -> 213
219 -> 214
220 -> 215
221 -> 216
222 -> 217
223 -> 218

Watched 223 -> 218 and thought this was the last ep of the season. Then watched 300 (recap episode) and the last 5 episodes of season 2 were spoiled. It ruined the show quite a bit yeah :'(

Anyone know where I can download the rest? It's hard to find..."

,mungo73,2010-01-19T17:20Z,"This torrent has episodes 1 to 23

I found 24, 25 and 26 inside another piratebay torrent (http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5037055/Greys_Anatomy_-_Season_2_Complete) but even that was missing the last episode which is Episode 27: Losing My Religion.

I downloaded only episode 27 from another torrent at the following address

This last link has all seasons of Greys anatomy so select only what you need"
