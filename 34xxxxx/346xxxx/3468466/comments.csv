,GeeTI,2006-04-09T17:29Z,"Thanks rrodger99!

Where does the dll file go? windows/system32 ?"
,rrodger99,2006-04-09T18:05Z,"@GeeTI...The dll file is just there for the key generator.

@joe_81..I have never had real success getting the RXP gauges to work so I quit trying...not just an issue on this plane...just in general.

,AgentSmith.,2006-04-09T20:28Z,crap...been at 0% d/l...
,Bob Magic,2006-04-09T22:12Z,This plane handles beautifully. The panel needs a lot of help. Gauges of diffent sizes and colors. GPS is embedded in the center of the panel and cannot be turned off. FSD has protected this panel so it cannot be modified with Panel Studio. The Background is protected and can't be modified either. What you see is what you get! BUT it was FREE so thank you rrodger99.
,AgentSmith.,2006-04-10T01:31Z,open up panel.cfg with notepad and replace the GPS entries with whatever you want...i'll be replacing it with RXP's and adding the TAWS unit onto the panel.
,AgentSmith.,2006-04-10T01:59Z,"quick question...the KEYGEN creates only one set of numbers, yet the Authorization is wanting two sets. any ideas?"
,rrodger99,2006-04-10T04:02Z,You only need to populate the 1st box with the # generated....when you hit next another window will pop up asking your name & for the same #s again.
,AgentSmith.,2006-04-10T09:12Z,"hmmm...for whatever reason, that's not happening for me. i entered the KEYGEN number into the first box and left the second one blank, and only thing to click is OK and EXIT. i click OK and i get ""Invalid  Authorization Code Entered"". and that's it."
,rrodger99,2006-04-10T12:10Z,@AgentSmith...follow the directions on the keygen window....they appear when you open the keygen....make sure you change the target aircraft to the Navajo
,bushbear,2006-04-11T15:29Z,"Agent, and all, you need to run the keygen in a separate pc. It will let you run the keygen in same pc only once. Then no more! Happened to me. Had to redo my XP install and installed then FSD planes (all avail at PIRATEbay) with 2 pc's, then the rest of planes other peope (flight1, etc)"
,bushbear,2006-04-11T15:46Z,"Hey all, if anyone got the following FSD planes, please...Aerostar, Commander 115, Seneca V. WARNING: DO NOT APPLY -> FS 2004 Service Release dated February 24, 2004. IT WILL NOT INSTALL AND WILL MESS UP YOUR NAVAJO..if you do, write down your Lic to: and Lic ID (LOAD MANAGER NAVAJO), unistall it and reinstall it running FSDPA31v9.exe again. no keygen needed to reinstall. The same goes for the avail FSD planes thru PIRATEbay.
Lets help each other...fly happy..."
,AgentSmith.,2006-04-11T19:49Z,"i appreciate the extra effort guys; but alas, it still won't work. i ran the KEYGEN on a different computer but i still get the same error. i do have a legit install of the Navajo; but I haven't gotten that thing to install either. could this be some kind of weird thing with FSD stuff like you mentioned?"
,bushbear,2006-04-11T20:12Z,"AgentSmith, are these probles just with Navajo? Do u have other FSD planes installed?"
,AgentSmith.,2006-04-12T00:52Z,i have the Cheyenne 400 and the Seneca V installed...both FS2002 versions.
,bushbear,2006-04-12T13:22Z,"AgentSmith, So you used the FSDKeymaker before but not in FS2004? It is a very different animal..And why no FS2004? PC not enough?"
,AgentSmith.,2006-04-12T20:52Z,"naww...i'm runnin' FS2004. it's just those two versions are for FS2002, installed into my FS2004."
,bushbear,2006-04-14T12:50Z,"If you are runnin XP w FS9.1 these 2 (C337 & Navajo) go in like butter. If another OS and FS2002, maybe different animal. But after fresh OS install (XP w/SP2) ,FSD planes should install OK if u use 2 computers. U must use a separate PC for the KEYGEN always. Good luck!"
,AgentSmith.,2006-04-14T16:44Z,"rgr that...yes, that's what i'm running, XP w/ 9.1. i'll keep the files around for my fresh install and do as you said. thanks for your time."
,redoxidus,2006-05-03T19:13Z,x
,redoxidus,2006-05-03T19:15Z,is it possible to create a torrent with the FSD planes already installed into each folder instead of a self intaller so the user will manually copy them into the sim? only curious....lol
,CaptainH,2006-09-01T00:26Z,Please Seed!!!
,NZ01,2007-10-17T15:49Z,Stuck @ 97%......it won't take a minute if someone would share w/me
