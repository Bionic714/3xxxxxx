,God.Hunter.89,2007-04-28T18:07Z,"Alright, First of all, The Torrent is good. No Virus'. Speed was average but it came down in a day or so.
However, Once i started installing the program, it takes a while (maybe its always like that) but then it gets to a sound file and has some problems with it, I can't remember the sound file's name, however I cancelled the Installation and started it again, and it seemed to clear through the sound files without a single problem. 

So to anyone with a similar problem, I can only suggest that you try a re-installation. As it worked for me.

Thanks Psy_Mushrooms, great torrent!

GodHunter"
,Novella2,2007-05-04T18:58Z,"Hello and thank you for putting this torrent up psy_Mushroom, much appreciated.

Everything went fine, download, installation and playing it.

And for you who wonders what the CD-Key is, just type random numbers and then ""next"" to start the installation."
,genestarwind2007,2007-05-16T22:16Z,What is with the runtime error?!

,twomedium,2007-06-20T20:21Z,"jag har problem, är det meningen att man ska bränna ner det på DVD eller? för jag har setat i fan 2 timmar med detta."
,Centrinity,2007-06-21T12:22Z,"The installation and playing the game was no problem, but sometime, or actually pretty often the text disappears, and that's quite annoying  when you don't see what they ask or they tell you what too do next. It runs fine om my sisters computer tough.
Does anyone else have the same problem or is it just me? Does someone know what's wrong and how to fix it?
Thanks for all your help."

Any assistance would be most useful.

@wuwesbexxor ""~uTorrentPartFile_8A0FC822.dat"" is just the tracker in the folder and has nothing to do outside teh torrent client."

,TheGreatDuck,2008-02-02T12:57Z,I am seeding.And could someone please answer my question...
,lozlink,2008-03-07T20:29Z,When I get right to the end it says that disc2C~1 is needed for installation but isn't found and that it's either corrupted or there is a problem reading from the drive. It's there and all the files are fine as far as I can tell and the only solution I could think of would be to have it in the disc drive but you cna't run two things on the smae drive and the Installation won't read from the second. Disc1C~1 was read fine. I'm running Windows XP.
