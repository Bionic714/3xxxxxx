I bet the ISPs have detected a worldwide surge in bandwidth useage over the last 24 hours as people rush to download the fix that fixes the fixed version of the fixed release that was corrupted while being fixed because the fix that fixed the fix wasn't quite fixed :D"
,Silverslith,2006-03-21T22:09Z,Im downloading all three as well. I can't wait.

,gravyhusker,2006-03-21T22:21Z,"Hey BearishSun
Thanks for all the hard work you'd put in today. It's cool that you kept at it. Keep it up. Don't let the lack of pirate ethics get you down. Some people here wish they were more than they are. "

Any chance of having the game runnable before say  10pm eastern time tonight?

(its 4:40 for me right now)"
,GrayFox2510,2006-03-21T22:40Z,"Finally, we get working versions. Thanks for all the work you did Bearish, now to wait for RELOADED's release and see which download wins the race..."
,BlakIdPea87,2006-03-21T22:41Z,"lol just be patient...the Reloaded releases are always good, and you won't die if you don't get to play for a couple of days (sheesh). 
"
,Ultimezia,2006-03-21T22:41Z,how du you DL on nforce??... cant figure it out?
,Felgard,2006-03-21T22:42Z,um im confused what are the curent recomendations as to download this or wait for a reload?
,caesarion,2006-03-21T22:42Z,you cant download from nforce.nl :p
,Hiddnfox,2006-03-21T22:43Z,"yea, how do you DL from that site. I cont figure it out. even after registering"
,Mr Malainor,2006-03-21T22:43Z,"i will die :P

have preorder in sweden but we are so slow on all games movies etc 2 days - never (never when the movie, game dont sell to good)"
,magnuslar,2006-03-21T22:44Z,"First off, great work BearishSun! :)

Second, any progress on the tracker or whatever is the problem, as noone is able to download? 

Oh, and have you played the game yet BearishSun? Is it as good as they say? :P"
,psiamp,2006-03-21T22:44Z,ok call me dumb but since i never used nforce before..how the hell do u download from them? 
,Rapishorrid,2006-03-21T22:44Z,"i will die too!!!

I need it before 10 tonight, my parents are gone etc...so I WILL PLAY.

damn reloaded i love you but get this shiet up!"
,Ultimezia,2006-03-21T22:45Z,its the same in denmark... sooo long waiting time for new media =(
,caesarion,2006-03-21T22:45Z,www.nforce.nl is NOT a download site..its just a site for listing new stuff...like www.theisoworld.com :p
,xunix,2006-03-21T22:46Z,"hey Psiamp,, you cannot DL anything from nforce.. its just a site for announcing releases from different warez groups.. they dont say anything about finding torrents. thats up to you.. 
hope things got a bit more clear now!"
,KaraTH,2006-03-21T22:47Z,"jesus, its bbeen said about a million times allready, ill spell it out for you.
Y-O-U   C-A-N-T   D-O-W-N-L-O-A-D   F-R-O-M   N-F-O-R-C-E"
,Felgard,2006-03-21T22:47Z,a well i need to sleep will be interesting to see how i will install this game. from my cd that i'll buy on friday or from here
,Silverslith,2006-03-21T22:47Z,It's gonna take some time for the speed on this to increase. But why not just dl this now and dl Reloaded version if it has better speed.
,caesarion,2006-03-21T22:49Z,because no one is seeding it? :p
,damnit199,2006-03-21T22:49Z,"I am connected for the last 20-30 mins I think. And I havent' downloaded a single byte. Yes, not a single byte while connected to 100leechers. WTF!"
,BlakIdPea87,2006-03-21T22:49Z,"Nforce.nl doesn't host any files. It is just a site to check for true NFO's for proper releases. If it is on Nforce.nl, then it is a proper/good/working release.

Once it shows up on Nforce.nl, you just have to wait until someone seeds it with a torrent file. (Again...PATIENCE!!! You will NOT die if you don't get to play the game 2 minutes from now!).


After all my experience in bit torrent land, I always wait for proper releases (no offense Bearish or anyone else that releases their own version). "
,Stalker8,2006-03-21T22:50Z,"BearishSun dude... your THE man, thanks a bunch really. Most people don't take the time to thank people properly and that's sad since i'm sure you put down a lot of work, again big thanks man!

and for those who still are in doubt, this IS the real thing (i hope :P)"
,KaraTH,2006-03-21T22:51Z,"um, yea, that might be it

Come on RELOADED link please. someone? anyone? no one?"
,BearishSun,2006-03-21T22:52Z,"I don't know what's with the upload...it seems to be a problem with the tracker

we'll have to wait"
,bearskin,2006-03-21T22:56Z,"Otack är världens lön.

Great name Bear! And awesome work on this whole deal!"
,IceMaster,2006-03-21T22:57Z,"Whoever said posters on nforce were saying the reloaded version is fake was LYING.  I looked myself and that's not what they're saying at all.

If I were you guys, I would wait a few hours for the reloaded one to make its way over here rather than spend days downloading a version that the uploader hasn't even tried to see if it works..."
,BearishSun,2006-03-21T22:59Z,"This version works, but I just haven't tried with this way of installing(replacing the meshes file manually instead of using quickpar). This should be completely safe, but nothing is ever certain"
,KennyGzor,2006-03-21T23:00Z,Thank You Bearish Sun ! 
,bibihest,2006-03-21T23:01Z,Im just glad Bear has used so much time to make so many people happy even after having to listen to alot of crap

,scarfacexxx,2006-03-21T23:09Z,gotta also point out ur there to type a response to any comment try this  just fuckin SEEDING IT 
,garymoz,2006-03-21T23:19Z,Reload version is comming so fast for me from private site.;) Thanks Bearish for the eforth..
,Silverslith,2006-03-21T23:19Z,Not the best speeds on the reloaded release yet. But still a bit better than this one. But wtf. will just dl. all three then...

The number of files looks real (50X90MB), "
,scarfacexxx,2006-03-21T23:31Z,lmao @ ur size for a jpg image wat is it a pic of ur moms ass?   :P
,BesteN1336,2006-03-21T23:32Z,?? what are u talking about? 
,psiamp,2006-03-21T23:33Z,"i went to that site an started downloading what is suppose to be the reloaded one.. for the site.. http://ts.searching.com/torrent/616592/The_Elder_Scrolls_IV_Oblivion_RELOADED ...and guess what i found???? it only has 88 files an its size is 4.18gb...as the reloaded one is suppose to 4.5gb...50x90=4.5gb...so i dont think the one on that site is the real reloaded..ill just wait till one comes along that has right amount of files an..and is prpoer size

on a side note the one from bear im stuck at 1.1mb..for past 30 minutes...so ill leave it an see what happens.."
,Silverslith,2006-03-21T23:38Z,"psiamp: Ur forgetting about the .rar file and the .00 file. 88+2 = 90. But ur right about the file size. But im done with it in 16 hours, we'll see then.."
,BesteN1336,2006-03-21T23:39Z,its 92files and all of them is 47.68Mb but 2 of the files is like 5kb and thats the .sfv and .nfo file. 
,BesteN1336,2006-03-21T23:50Z,i hope u know that the files never is exactly is 50mb or 30mb or whatever they just vrite like 30Mb if the file is 27mb etc
,BearishSun,2006-03-21T23:56Z,damn tracker...
,almalexia,2006-03-21T23:58Z,guys is this realease a good one????
,TimC,2006-03-22T00:00Z,"Guys the reloaded rars are the right size. It's just because they count MB as 10^6 Bytes, while in ""real"" MB it's 1024^2. So that's why 50MB turns into 47.68, 15MB into 14.3 etc."
,psiamp,2006-03-22T00:03Z,timc thanks for clearing that up for me.......
,almalexia,2006-03-22T00:08Z,"i always downloaded the deviance and reloaded stuff, but i'll stay with this guy's release because he really tried so hard to give us the game.
but i'm wondering why the reloaded guys haven't uploaded the game on TPB ?????????"
,NightWalker89,2006-03-22T00:38Z,Thanks allot Bearshun! You really worked hard even when some of those ass holes showed up. and all for us. Your rock! Hats off to you!
[V],jnd,2006-03-22T01:24Z,"""but i'm wondering why the reloaded guys haven't uploaded the game on TPB ?????????""

LOL

Warez groups never really upload stuff to torrent sites."
,psilocybe,2006-03-22T15:17Z,"this fix is working, i got it working, just keep trying, u dont need to write ""oblivionlocation -mds and so on, u only need to write bsdtar -xf ""oblivionlocation, use backslashes, and oblivion-ind.tar.gz, then let it work until the files r done, itll take about 5 minutes or so, the rest works as it should"
