This is awesome and crazy klezmer music filled with energy.

"There are some genres of music that can't help but brighten one's day or put a grin on one's face. And Frank London has taken the traditional klezmer style and inserted a whole bundle of oomph and verve into it once again. Rarely would music result in a joyous creation of a feverish Hasidic mosh pit, but the exuberance found on the leadoff track, "In Your Garden Twenty Fecund Fruit Trees," sets the standard for the next near hour of gear-shifting klezmer, with London letting the frantic tempo lead as he tries his best to keep up with dazzling solo work."
