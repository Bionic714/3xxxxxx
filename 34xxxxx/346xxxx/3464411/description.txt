[b]Bio:[/b]

As one of Fat Wreck Chord's very first bands, Propagandhi have long been going 

against the grain of not just society, but even their own record label. The 

radicals from Winnipeg, Canada, got together in 1989 and eventually played a show 

with NOFX. After talking with Fat Mike and realizing they shared the same D.I.Y. 

attitude, the band agreed to join his fledgling label. Ideally, the band would 

have loved to skirt the entire capitalist process of selling and marketing music, 

but made compromises in order to get its pro-gay, pro-feminist, pro-civil 

liberties, anti-fascism message out. Screeching over fast, catchy punk music, the 

group moved easily from humorous to profound to blunt with song titles like "I Was 

a Pre-Teen McCarthyist," "Hate, Myth, Muscle, Etiquette," and "Stick That Fucking 

Flag Up Your Goddamn Ass, You Skinhead Creep."

That style took a dramatic turn in 1997 when singer, songwriter, and bassist John 

K. Samson left to write, start a publishing company, and eventually form the 

Weakerthans. The remaining members of Propagandhi started their own label, G7 

Welcoming Committee, which released the band's third album, Where Quantity Is Job 

#1, along with Weakerthans' records and Propagandhi's 2001 effort, Today's Empire, 

Tomorrow's Ashes, in Canada. Founding member and guitarist/vocalist Chris Hannah 

left the group in 2003, leaving Jordy Samolesky and Todd Kowalski to the difficult 

task of finding a replacement. They eventually settled on Portage Terriers 

vocalist Glenn Lambert and quickly headed into the studio. Both Where Quantity Is 

Job #1 -- a compilation of live tracks, demos, and previously unreleased material 

-- and Potemkin City Limits were released in 2005. 

[b]Review:[/b]

A bunch of hardcore anarchists on Fat Wreck Chords? You mean they've expanded 

beyond the realm of signing bands that sing primarily about girls, beer, and 

partying? Propagandhi have "smash the state" written all over them and they want 

to be taken seriously rather than branded as another generic NOFX-wannabe band. 

How to Clean Everything accomplishes more than escaping the carbon-copy labeling 

-- it also puts their message on a high pedestal so it can be heard loud and 

clear. And in the midst of all the "throwing the monkey wrench in the system" 

rants, they still have a little fun at the expense of all the bubble gum pop-punk 

bands that flood the market and even their own label. With How to Clean Everything 

representing Anarchy 101 to a mass audience, Propagandhi aren't afraid to show the 

world that a government coup can be fun and educational at the same time.
