,hugo1965,2008-03-20T15:53Z,"The Naked Gun movies have good video and audio, Police Squad video is O.K. but audio has some kind of ""transmitter noise"" which is acceptable"
,JaXkeMzKzM,2008-12-28T23:11Z,"hugo1965 is right, except for the first Naked Gun movie, audio is 0.3-0.4 seconds out of sync.
