,Rasva,2009-12-31T11:38Z,"Kaloskid and others with crashing problem: I had the same problem, but I downloaded the patch from here http://www.firaxis.com/games/game_detail.php?gameid=7 and followed the instructions:
Open file Alpha Centauri.ini in your game folder.
Change the line ForceOldVoxelAlgorithm=0 to ForceOldVoxelAlgorithm=1 and save file. Game should run fine on Windows xp now."

,Kazinsal,2010-03-05T00:58Z,"Amazing work, seeders, got a steady 1 MB/s."
,Berzerked,2011-04-07T10:18Z,"16 (21) seeders, about to be 22 :3 despide only that many seeders im still getting 1mbps :') Fucking brilliant (+1)"
,Berzerked,2011-04-07T11:03Z,"Word of warning though, for an hour ive tried to play this game and its been fruitless. If your running windows 7, vista or xp there's a chance you wont be able to play untill you install some crappy patch. however, that iddnt work for me so im uninstalling. Good luck to anybody else."
