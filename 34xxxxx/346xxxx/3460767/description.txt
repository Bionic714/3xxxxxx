Iguidance for Windows version 2.1.1

By Inavcorp, a navigation software that lets you use most standard gps recievers. Voice navigation, adjust adjusting map. It's pretty one of the best nav apps available. Although this version is slightly out of date, it still should be acceptable to most.

Mods are available at mp3car.com in the gps forums.
