,mikethejones,2006-04-05T01:48Z,    Someone requested these cracks.
,Calenulma,2006-04-05T21:48Z,"By ""what for"" I ment ""what's the difference between them""? Do the d the same thing?"
,mikethejones,2006-04-06T02:42Z,"   I got a large bundle of cracks one day and all four of these were together under Civilization III, so I uploaded all four together.  I do that when I can in case one crack doesn't work for someone, they have more to choose from."
,albertii,2006-04-06T20:10Z,"1 of em is a NOCD for the old Civ 3 game OS9/OSX

2 others are Nocd's for the recent Complete Civ 3 game

the last thing is a crack for running that Civ 3 complete without using a serial key

Now will someone post us some serial keys so we can go multiplayer"
