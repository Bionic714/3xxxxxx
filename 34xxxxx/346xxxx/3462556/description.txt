This Manchester combo formed by guitarists Dave Fielding and Reg Smithies ? after their bandmates in the Chameleons went off to launch the Sun and the Moon in 1987 ? mixes a droney semi-psychedelic attack and a strong melodic sensibility with partial success. Though a few memorable numbers like "Blind Denial" yield a nice power pop/art rock hybrid that recalls some of the Church's finer moments, the Reegs' tendency to overuse technical frills ? like the stiff programmed drumming that dominates too many of their tunes ? works against the band's better interests. Indeed, it's on quieter, more acoustically based efforts, like "Goodbye World" and "Running to a Standstill" that the band shines most brightly. 

...without doubt nothing short of a minor masterpiece with the guitars and synths often merging together to haunting effect for example on the album's best track ?the Nasty Side? which a few words often can say a lot or even on songs like ?The Dream Police? where the guitars bend and frequently twist but yet keep the sound that made The Chameleons so damn good in the first place.
