     wow. trent reznor is the most talented musician
     working today. being the huge nine inch nails
     fan that i am, i have gotten my hands on
     anything nin-related i could find and i have to
     say he has never put out a bad-anything, be it
     track or remix. his music is so well-layered
     that every time you listen, you discover a new
     subtlety. not only that, he is in complete
     control of his music.
