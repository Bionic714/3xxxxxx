,golfraggarn,2007-07-11T11:24Z,"This aint working so dont download , fuck u demonlegacy"
,madhouserevival,2007-07-23T04:00Z,"Sure it works. Problem is, it doesn't recognize anyone's video hardware and will only run in software rendering mode. Piece of shit game (though torrent is fine). Not one patch available to fix the video problem. God damn the game company."
,Ieviathan,2007-10-24T10:38Z,"This isn't worth the time to download. I have a NVIDIA card, have to turn the settings all the way down (just so the textures show)...it looks horrible, playstation 1 horrible."
,friedcrispy,2007-11-25T16:31Z,it works completely for me. it does not screw up my system either so i dont understand what people are complaining about.
,imlkrsfn,2007-12-22T20:55Z,When it asks for cd 1 just put in the cd of any game you have or mount an image of a game.  I used need for speed 3 image with damontools and it worked.
,Osmodius,2008-02-04T05:22Z,"You're better off downloading the PSX version and emulating it.

Use ePSXe, it works well with MGS."
,Lootskin,2008-02-18T13:00Z,"The CR missions are awesome :D

But i get the ""Instert Disk 1"" problem, i'll try mounting STALKER and see if it works."
,Lootskin,2008-02-18T13:07Z,"I meant the VR missions.

And yes, it works! Just mount any image of a game you have with Daemon Tools."
,truthy,2008-03-05T03:45Z,"unless you have a VERY OLD PC there's no way this will work! Compatibility-Mode no use too! All the available cracks crash the game and the mini-images don't work either. You might be more lucky with a ATI-Card, but i doubt it will run on a 'modern' system ...

I downloaded the PSX-Version http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3737431/Metal_Gear_Solid_1_PSX_2nd_upload and emulated it trough ePSXe. Worked fine even with XP and my GeForce 8 - I used the Pete's OpenGL2 Driver 2.8 with high settings as a video plugin and of course my controller.

thx for the torrent - too bad it doesn't work."
,ati97,2008-04-04T21:49Z,This was simply the best game for psx.And your stuff is great!!!Bring back memories.Metal Gear Rulez!Thanx DemonLegacy!!

,POOPIEMON,2008-04-12T01:14Z,"when prompted for disc 1 or 2 insert any game on cd you have, it works just fine. except when you get to the control room at the end of the game you get stuck in a room, the gmae registers the foor as open but u cannot pass"
,POOPIEMON,2008-04-12T01:32Z,"i found this on a website on how to get out of the control room d. it does work 


Ok, figured it out. I'd been stuck on this same problem for about 3 hours and wasn't gonna stop 'til I figured it out. Here we go:

Create a shortcut to MGSI.exe. From there, right click on it and hit 'properties.' See where it says Path? Cool. At the end of that, add in this:

-cheatenable

Make sure it's OUTSIDE the ""s.

Load the game up from that shortcut. Do everything as you normally would, and if the door doesn't open, hit F7. Bingo."

,smonk22,2012-06-27T06:37Z,"This does appear to work (after a long period of tinkering/reading old comments).  I'm running win7 x64 on a cheap laptop.

1)Install the game as is.  You will be creating a Metal Gear Solid folder in your Program Files folder.
2)Go to gamecopyworld and search for 
Metal Gear Solid v1.0 [ENGLISH] No-CD/WinXP+Vista+ GeForce+ATi Fixed EXE
3)Download the file and unzip it with winrar.
4)Replace MGSI and MGSVR from the Metal Gear Solid folder with the ""mgsi"" and ""mgsvr"" from the unzipped files.
5)This is the weird part: the game still requires there to be a ""CD"" in the ""CD drive.""  So, using Daemon Tools Lite (which you can download for free if you don't have and is awesome and worth it) you have to mount a cd image.  Apparently any old image will work, and some posts claim you can just pop in a dvd.  The one that worked for me is from the Tomb Raider 2 PC game.  Here is the link to download it:

http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4994878/Tomb_Raider_2__[PC_game]

The image you will be mounting is the Tr2 MDS file.

I hope this helps.  This is overly simplistic and just copied information from other commenters, but I had enough trouble with this that I hope others are spared the time."
