from http://german.imdb.com/title/tt0466191

there is a bad mood in Germany nowadays. more than 4 million unemployed people, sinking birth rates, the old must worry about their rent, social structures like health insurance become more and more expensive etc. etc. the government failed to make social reforms over years. something has to be done!

this film gives some ironically meant suggestions how to improve live and to help German economy. the basic idea: "if you want to change the country you must change the human being and the way people think".

it is made in documentary style but is in fact a comedy. there are about 8 fictitious stories about people and their ideas who try to save Germany from its downfall. (dont want to spoil more)

all in all a very original and funny movie.
