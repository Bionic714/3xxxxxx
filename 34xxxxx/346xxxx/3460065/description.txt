There are lots of mods for Ghost Recon (check out www.damnr6.com, macgamingmods.com, ghostrecon.net to name a few). For multiplay, going in and out of the game to switch them on and off can be a pain (especially on places like Gameranger where there a lot of different types of game rooms). This little app lets u do it quickly, outside of the game.
It's out there but hard to find - so I thought I'd post it here.
