Create your own space adventures in this game based on the best-selling book from author/illustrator Chris Van Allsburg, now a movie directed by John Favreau. Two young brothers, Walter and Danny, find a board game that transports them, along with their entire house, into outer space! The boys have to overcome a variety of challenges and their sibling rivalry. Play as Walter, Danny, or a rampaging robot. Use each character's unique abilities to handle every obstacle. Fifteen levels span the universe and go beyond what's seen in the book and movie. Take on over 36 intergalactic adversaries including lizardy Zorgons, evil robots, and a host of other twisted alien creatures.
