The Living End's second studio album and in my opinion their second best (behind their self titled debut). Ripped in VBR 128-320kbps for your listening pleasure. Enjoy! :)

Please ignore (mods please delete) the other torrent with duplicate files. I should've checked they were right before uploading - MY BAD! :(

But enjoy this one.
