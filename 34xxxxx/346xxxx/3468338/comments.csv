,mb_carlton,2006-04-09T11:19Z,"Great upload - but not so thrilled about the suspention. I missed that the race was on saturday instead of sunday (Muslims don't allow racing on sundays?) so I'd be thrilled if someone steps up and seed. Thanks in advance, and good upload sammysung!"
,Myrkin,2006-04-09T13:27Z,"Sammysung, your client should distribute the torrent amongst the connected peers so that no peers get the same piece. Thus it should not matter if there are few or many connected - the rate at which the torrent gets more seeds should be the same.
Thanks a lot for the torrent!"
,mb_carlton,2006-04-09T13:31Z,"Looks like sammysung is using Mainline 4.4.1, let's hope the speed increases. Take a look at ÂľTorrent - http://www.utorrent.com/"
,ymee242,2006-04-10T09:40Z,is this video from eurosport with the british commentators julian and toby?
,sammysung,2006-04-11T11:42Z,"cheers for the info folks. not especially technically minded, so thought it affected one and all.

fwiw the UK network for regular customers is being upgraded to 8mb broadband soon and increases in upload speeds should come with it, so future stuff should be faster.


the file, yep it's the eurosport with toby, julian and randy.  there's no pre-race build-up since I decided to keep the file a bit smaller (last race was almost 1gb) but it includes the post-race interviews etc (ignore the 'end of recorded program' warning and keep going).  I spent the time to cut out the ads this time too.

Enjoy them while they last though, from France to Germany (inclusive) I can't do them. Only the fly-away rounds I'm afraid.  "
