,JamesHenry89,2008-06-20T14:24Z,"!!!I WROTE THIS FOR ANOTHER PLACE BUT IT IS ALL RELEVANT!!! MAKE SURE YOU DO EVERYTHING IT SAYS!!!

Sorry for caps!

Horray I fixed it.

Ok here's what you do.

1Download the game. Mount using deamon tools.

2 Explore the game files and copy them all to a file off the image itself. (I used desktop/godfather) This is so you can edit the files.

3 Then go into the ""Auto Run"" and open ""autorun.cfg"" file and change the
""DirectXVersion=9.0c"" propertie to ""DirectXVersion=0"".

Then install as usual.

*NOTES*

When installing the game mount the MDF file. When playing the game mount the MDS file.

Make sure you have ""SAFEDISK"" emulation turned on.

Edit the exe so that you play in SP2 compatability mode

change the directory in the game file to ""_movies""

After all that it should work! It would be helpful if this was in the .txt file in the torrent but thanks for the upload anyway.

Hope this helps!"
