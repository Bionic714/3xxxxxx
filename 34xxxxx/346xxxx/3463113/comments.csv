,pheonixltd,2006-04-01T07:55Z,"Hello, I need some help, Iam not sure how to copy this to a dvd. I got half in rar files and half in image files. When I extrack one of the rar files it creates an img file thats 4 gb. Every rar file does this. Am I doing something wrong? Please help. Thanks"
,t0rk,2006-04-01T22:40Z,"LOL :) you only need to extract the .rar file, then burn the .img file with nero. in nero chose burn image from the recorder meny, the rest you should be able to figure out. good luck "
,LINEBACKER 2,2006-04-04T01:27Z,Does this fit on a regular DVD5??
,DragonsFyre,2006-04-04T09:17Z,It will fit a DVD. A Normal DVD will fit something like 4.7 Gigs. If you cannot get the .img file to burn you can also use WinRar (or some other Rar app) to extract the contents and then use nero or even dvdshrink to burn the DVD. Thank again t0rk!
,SauronSLO,2006-04-04T23:33Z,Is this full DVD quality? I thought that original DVD have about 8GB.
,t0rk,2006-04-05T19:46Z,"SauronSLO: of course its dvd quality, but it has been ""shrinked"" from a DVD9 to fit a 4,7gb dvdr."
,boorsey,2006-04-05T22:51Z,"Awesome up, and you are quite a patient person, you're very polite to the worriers!"

,waleedmassoud,2006-05-19T14:41Z,"Dear t0rk: decompression of the rar file gave me an img file. When I used nero to burn image only 3 types of image files were available on Nero's types of image files; cue, iso, and rng. but img file was notpresent. Thanks in advance"
,G4turr0,2006-08-18T03:26Z,"Help, i use winrar to extract the .img file, but i could not burn the image in a dvd, suggestions?? thanks"
,TheSpenner,2006-09-04T06:14Z,G4turr0 - try renaming the .img file to .iso and see if Nero burns it correctly. Will see for myself once this finishes downloading.
