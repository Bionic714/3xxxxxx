Gothic Melancholy Vol.4 - Home made compilation by AssMaster
Released at The Pirate Bay

Quality differs from 128 kbps to vbr ~200 kbps, most songs
are around 192 kbps though. I haven't ripped these tunes,
they're picked from various albums, both scene and non-scene
releases. I take only credit for compiling the albums.

The songs are picked by me, and are for my listening pleasures,
so if you don't like them, I don't care. I you DO like them,
you're more than welcome to write a comment at TPB :)
