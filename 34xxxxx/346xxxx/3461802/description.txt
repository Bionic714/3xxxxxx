[b]Bio[/b]

Hailing from the small town of Big Bear Lake, CA, punk-popsters the Line -- comprised of members Doh H (vocals and guitar), Gip K (bass), Ryan L (guitar), and M (drums) -- have been slugging it out since the early to mid-'90s. February of 1995 saw the release of their self-titled debut, which resulted in a staggering 18-month supporting tour (playing with such big-name bands as Sublime, Guttermouth, and Less Than Jake across the U.S. and Canada). In 1997, the Line issued their sophomore effort, Auricle, which resulted in the quartet's first-ever European tour (joined by the groups Millencolin and Satanic Surfers). Their third release, Disimilar, saw the light of day in January of 2000, which lead to more touring, a spot on the entire 2001 Warped Tour, a recording contract with MCA, and their major-label debut, Monsters We Breed, in October of the same year.
