     - Release notes ----------------------------------------------


     The electro-powered grooves of the writing-
     production team the Neptunes have abetted fine-
     to-great tracks by everyone from Jay-Z and Ol'
     Dirty Bastard to Britney Spears. On their debut
     as performers, they display an irresistible
     knack for hooky tracks rooted in the eclectic
     listening habits they developed while growing up
     in the multiracial Virginia Beach, Virginia,
     neighborhoods they still call home. Fusing album
     rock and rap more forcefully and convincingly
     than Kid Rock or Durst-style aggro bands (the
     latter of whom they seem to lampoon on "Rock
     Star"), N.E.R.D. whip up a creamy yet slammin'
     mix. Main men Pharrell Williams and Chad Hugo
     coax apropos guest shots from Kelis (the get-
     your-freak-on "Truth or Dare," the sexiest thing
     here aside from the m?nage-a-wow plea "Tape
     You") and a handful of up-and-coming members.
     The live instrumentation that replaces the
     machine-tooled tracks of an earlier import
     version of In Search Of retains the tunes'
     syncopation while rendering it palatable for
     less eclectic rock fans. While not a commercial
     blockbuster on the order of many of their
     clients' discs, this venture is nonetheless one
     of 2002's standout releases.
