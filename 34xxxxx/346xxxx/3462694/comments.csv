,allmypeople,2006-09-04T04:51Z,The arguements in this doc are easily owned by recent docs like An Inconvenient Truth and others that have aired on various news outlets.
,CaPolarBear,2007-04-30T03:31Z,"allmypeople: Your head is clearly firmly wedged between your butt cheeks. 

This is an excellent documentary that clearly refutes the arguments of An Inconvenient Truth. Unfortunately, it doesn't have the polish and a slick-willy salesman like Al Gore to push it to people like you. And to cite NEWS-channel based hysteria as fact... well, letting the news channels be the climate watchdogs is like letting pedophiles run daycare centres. If the news said, ""Hey - everything is going to be fine!"" would you even be watching?"

The audio is a bit out of sync. It would be great if someone could fix that."

The film ""An Incovenient Truth"" would make a great presentation if it would tell you the truth about global warming , it's quick flashing scenes and ill begotten music gave me a sense of forbodding and doesn't not help to convey a sense of workable energy alternatives, this film made me feel helpless and depressed. Much of the film is with Al Gore without anyone really backing up his views , it is like a big ego trip.My conclusion is if you want a pure disaster horror film then this is the one for you, but if you want a unbiased view of global temperature change then look to the bbc horizion documentary about global climate change. the nobel prize has lost all of its meaning and prestige since Al Gore got his. If anyone believes that humans causes global warming is either ignorant or having an agenda. Al Gore does have an agenda, look at his new company which buys and sells carbon credits, instant money for nothing.The ""Greener"" religion just doesn't standup to Scientific facts. Al Gore would sell his mother for a little feel good publicity. Alfred Nobel is probably rolling in his grave over what the Nobel prize become. The Nobel Peace Prize had lost it prestige long ago when it was given to Arafat, the father of modern terrorism.

The nine alleged errors in the film
# Mr Gore claims that a sea-level rise of up to 20 feet would be caused by melting of either West Antarctica or Greenland ""in the near future"". The judge said: ""This is distinctly alarmist and part of Mr Gore's ""wake-up call"". He agreed that if Greenland melted it would release this amount of water - ""but only after, and over, millennia"".""The Armageddon scenario he predicts, insofar as it suggests that sea level rises of seven metres might occur in the immediate future, is not in line with the scientific consensus.""

# The film claims that low-lying inhabited Pacific atolls ""are being inundated because of anthropogenic global warming"" but the judge ruled there was no evidence of any evacuation having yet happened.

# The documentary speaks of global warming ""shutting down the Ocean Conveyor"" - the process by which the Gulf Stream is carried over the North Atlantic to western Europe. Citing the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the judge said that it was ""very unlikely"" that the Ocean Conveyor, also known as the Meridional Overturning Circulation, would shut down in the future, though it might slow down.

# Mr Gore claims that two graphs, one plotting a rise in C02 and the other the rise in temperature over a period of 650,000 years, showed ""an exact fit"". The judge said that, although there was general scientific agreement that there was a connection, ""the two graphs do not establish what Mr Gore asserts"".

# Mr Gore says the disappearance of snow on Mt Kilimanjaro was directly attributable to global warming, but the judge ruled that it scientists have not established that the recession of snow on Mt Kilimanjaro is primarily attributable to human-induced climate change.

# The film contends that the drying up of Lake Chad is a prime example of a catastrophic result of global warming but the judge said there was insufficient evidence, and that ""it is apparently considered to be far more likely to result from other factors, such as population increase and over-grazing, and regional climate variability.""

# Mr Gore blames Hurricane Katrina and the consequent devastation in New Orleans on global warming, but the judge ruled there was ""insufficient evidence to show that"".

# Mr Gore cites a scientific study that shows, for the first time, that polar bears were being found after drowning from ""swimming long distances - up to 60 miles - to find the ice"" The judge said: ""The only scientific study that either side before me can find is one which indicates that four polar bears have recently been found drowned because of a storm.""That was not to say there might not in future be drowning-related deaths of bears if the trend of regression of pack ice continued - ""but it plainly does not su"
,Samscad66,2008-03-21T20:18Z,"Er, guys.  You think the government is the only one trying to control this debate?  The oil companies are pouring tens of millions of dollars into documentaries like this, and into science that refutes global warming.  

Global warming is a fact, and anybody over the age of 40 knows this because we've lived long enough to see a significant change in the climate.  You might also be interested to know that when I was a kid you didn't need to wear sunscreen even if you spent the whole day on the beach.  

I also think oldngreg should really quit spamming these kind of films with ""testimony"" from a ""Judge.""  Hello, judges deal with law, this is science.  That would be a SCIENTIST who would know best.  Even asking a judges opinion is smokescreening.

Anyone who knew anything about the scientific community and how it works would not question the truth of Global Warming.  The implication that the government can control 90% of the world's scientists is plain stupid.

HOWEVER, there is an important point to add.  Yes, they are going to introduce a carbon tax, because yes, they do want to enslave you.  But that doesn't mean Global Warming is not real, it just means that those in power always position themselves to take advantage of a bad situation, be it war, pestilence or natual disaster.  

It's time to make the corporations pay for their pollution, instead of externalizing costs to us."
,mista_g_,2008-04-11T19:01Z,"What Al Gore fails to mention is the correct correlation between CO2 and temperature rise.  Temperature drives CO2 in the atmosphere, not the other way around.  And our SUN drives temperature.  Rising CO2 emissions indicate bioactivity."
,mista_g_,2008-04-11T19:07Z,"The Global Warming doomsday alarmist theory is political, intending to drive economics towards ""green"" technology.  Which is fine, because the Western world, by and large, could do without oil just fine.  For the developing world, burning fossil fuels as a means to industrial development is the ONLY way.  DON'T deprive the third world!  Be informed!  Alternative energy to ween us off foreign oil dependency!"
,mista_g_,2008-04-11T19:09Z,PS: to propose that big oil paid for this doc is unfounded.  CBC is nothing but a no-nonsense broadcasting company with a hard-to-find Canadian bias.

To Samscad66 : I find it very interesting that the
response is never about the science just personal attacks.
For your information I am a retired College/Engineering Instructor and have never worked for any Petrol firms. "

Obviously you take science as something concrete like Al Gore asserts, but you've not read Aldous Huxley's Brave New World, as you would know it is easy to do just what you have asserted as nonsense, if you still think that it can't be done look at the recent vioxx scandal, where ~90% of scientific journals found no issues with use of the drug, the other ~10% told the world the truth and only 100,000+ people died in the end.. or the war on terror where the entire world has been tricked and convinced that there is an invisible enemy, lets not do a body count here. However it is not the government itself that directs these agendas, it is the corporate elements in positions of power and the lobbyist friendly past-the-post voting system that allows the brave new world style scientific dictatorships to proliferate though the NGO's such as the IMF, UN and the world bank among others. 

Through peaceful voting reform we can end this ""spread of democracy"" as the US calls it, and start to find a sustainable future for the human race. As long as voters allow the continuation of the liberal/conservative, GOP/Democrat debate, the warmongering, blood thirsty, country occupying US Navy will continue to shape the world.......and space.

What about Africa?????
