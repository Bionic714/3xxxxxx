,jade_impire,2006-04-11T03:24Z,"indierockerseattle:
Some Games are larger than normal store bought DVD. For Example Halo 2 fits on a DVD5, but the Collectors Edition fits only on a DVD9. DVD5 is a 4.7 GB DVD, and DVD9 is a dual layer DVD that can hold much more than 4.7 GB. So thats why you need to check and make sure your not downloading a torrent thats to big for the DVD's you have laying around. Otherwise you are going to spend alot of money buying a dual layer burner, and dual layer DVD's about $10 a pop."
