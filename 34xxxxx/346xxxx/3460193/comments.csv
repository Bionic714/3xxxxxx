[V],Rababer,2006-03-20T21:21Z,can I just burn this on a dvd and play all the old nintendo 64 games on my xbox? Would be nice!
[V],Rababer,2006-03-20T21:30Z,but it would be more fun with old nintendo nes games on xbox...
,sukki,2006-03-20T21:40Z,"Eitherstore them on the XBOX HD, burn most to a DVD the remaining to a CDR, or just delete some pointless games to make room. Eitherway, it's up to you. :)"

,dan_plus_o,2006-03-21T06:00Z,But you still need the emulator. I have a SNES emulator and I love playing super mario brothers 3 (off Mario all star). I could get a nes one but the only game I like on NES are mario bros and I already have it for the super. I know where to get these emulators for the xbox so if you want them send me a PM.
,drtysnchz,2006-03-22T08:21Z,the original NES marios are better than the SNES all-star versions any day.
,JesperThelin,2006-03-23T08:23Z,could this be DL to the xbox as a emulator on the harddrive?
,skullcowboy9t9,2006-04-02T17:55Z,"As suspected, each rom does NOT work as indicated.  Many N64 roms don't work on xbox because there's just not enough memory for them.  These are no different.  Some do... some don't.  Good luck finding the ones that do.  By the way, Zelda does not."

N64 Specs:
94MHz MIPS R4000 64-bit CPU
4MB RAM (upgradeable to 8MB with Expansion Pack)
62 MHz graphics processor with a maximum resolution of 640x480
16-bit sound card with a 24 channel average
64MB game cartridges "
,elyk1212,2006-07-21T09:50Z,"
Are you basing this on anything concrete?  As you can see N64 has only 8mb (max)  of memory, an Xbox has 64mb and a 733Mhz processor.  Addressing *could* be an issue, however, it is likely emulating these differing registers, interrupts,  memory locations,etc.  Handling interrupts services in an emulation is a pain.  I should know, Computer engineer/science double major."
,elyk1212,2006-07-21T09:51Z,"
So, anyhow, I completely disagree with the memory being an issue.  Emulation is not perfect, and likely will never be 100%.  This is the nature of the beast folks, sorry to say.  However, emulation is only as good as the software you are using.  Also, it helps if the hardware it is running on is somewhat similar. Note the N64 uses a MIPS instruction set, while Xbox uses X86."
,elyk1212,2006-07-21T09:58Z,"Oh yeah, and if you are using a standard pc, you are also likely using a derivation X86 intel instruction set.  If you want to run 100% use a backup device ON the N64.  This is the best way to run roms, as no real emulation is needed."

,elyk1212,2006-08-15T10:07Z,"""Zelda Ocarina of Time cartridge = 256 MB""

No, no, you misread your info.... it is 256 Mega Bits of instructions, not Mega Bytes (checked on Wikipedia).  Some people use that abbreviation interchangeable, but there is a pretty big difference there... a factor of 8!  Please look this one up.  1 megabit = 10^6 = 1,000,000 bits = 125,000 bytes or 125 kilobytes.  So 256*125KB = 32,000KB = 32MB. 

(BTW, 1 byte = 8 bits.  So one can see how 1k/8 bits= 125KB, right?)"
,elyk1212,2006-08-15T10:08Z," Even so, this has nothing to do with what I was discussing.  With 64bits, it is possible to address more instructions (2^64 bytes, or [2^64]/2 if assuming even byte boundaries, if memory serves me), but the cart size has little to do with the system memory (unless it includes some type of hardware to do so).

Anyhow, The amount of instructions to execute on a game cartridge has nothing to do with the amount of RAM available to the system.  The Ram appears to still be limited to 8MB, as stated by Nintendo (specs w/expansion pack).  "
,elyk1212,2006-08-15T10:12Z,"	As a given, the Xbox has MORE ram than a N64....  Oh well, don't take my word for it.  Please do look it up.  You can learn a lot by doing so (I have)."

Most will let you opt to ignore this issue.  I just use growisofs in linux, or K3B (which will use this anyhow).  Nero will allow you to ignore the restriction, from what I hear (haven't used it in years)....  Anyone..."

Your conclusion is spot on, though. I'm just annoyed by people assuming 1 kilobyte equals 1,000 bytes."
,phreak22,2007-08-06T14:27Z,"1) You need a MODDED xbox to run this.
2) You can either BURN THIS TO DISC or COPY IT TO YOUR XBOX HARD DRIVE.
3) This is for the XBOX, NOT the 360.
4) Check out xbox-scene.com for help & tutorials.
5) Ask stupid questions @ xbox-scene.com forums, not here.
6) If you need software to extract the ISO to put on the hard drive, you will need to download it from xbins on IRC. To do this, you need an IRC client like mIRC & an FTP client like FlashFXP. Open mIRC and connect to any EFNet server, then ""/join #xbins"" and type ""/msg xbins !list"" in the room for the FTP info incl. your username & password."

RIght right, I know....  It should be 1kb = 2^10 = 1024 bits =128 bytes.

I should say ~= in my equations , as I am using my equals quite liberally.

But dang bro, it is hard enough to explain to folk!  I thought I would hack off some complexity. Hmmm thought may not be a good word.. I think I wrote that pretty late. LOL. "
,elyk1212,2007-08-18T10:18Z,"** Oh, hey wait, both you AND I miss read my post!!  **

I wrote that a long time ago....

I never said 1kB/8 = 125KB... I knew someone would say something when I wrote that LOL. I do remember that part of the post.   I even miss read my own notation.

Anyhow, If you recall (or look above) I said

""1k/8bits = 125Bytes!""

By this I mean 1 kilobit. I was careful to right 'k' not kB.  I mean the metric version of Kilo, not the base two 2^10 version.

This means 1,000 bits /8bits = 125 Bytes.  Clearly, at least now, I was going for a scale comparable to MegaBits.   Which is NOT based on power of 2.


Obvious conversions:
------------------------------------
 Megabit  	 Mb  	 1000 kilobits
 kilobit  	 kb  	 1000 bits
------------------------------------

This is a common misconception when you deal with Kilobits and MegoBits, not BYTES. 

--------------------------------------
 So yeah, there are no powers of 2 to consider in this case!!!   (Neglecting meanings of the bits)
--------------------------------------

  I thought I could not have made such an obvious mistake.

Shoot.... I am an engineer. ;)  We don't make mistakes, right ;)  ?  

(as I am saying that more people are pointing out fallacies in my statements lol)"
,elyk1212,2007-08-18T10:31Z,"""125,000 bytes or 125 kilobytes. So 256*125KB = 32,000KB = 32MB. ""

But yeah, you're right, I mixed notations and made it unclear.  That part is a little bizarre, as it is non conventional.  I should say 125,000 bytes and leave it at that, I suppose. 

My statement ""125 kilobytes"", here is an even metric -> 1,000. , and therefore 125 thousand-bytes

Darn notations!

Once you re-read my statements, they will make sense.  Hopefully..."
