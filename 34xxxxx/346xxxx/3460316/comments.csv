,columbo99,2006-03-30T01:25Z,"Please post Season 2 Episode 5 when you get a chance please if you can..

All the rest have been great thanks."
,Zoara,2006-03-30T23:42Z,"Hi all

I know where Series 2 Episode 5 is.

Go to isohunt.com, search for 'Ricky Gervais'. Then sort the results into DATE order.  Look for one of the most recent.
There is 145MB file - it has all 5 podcasts from series 2 in a single torrent. 

If someone could upload just Episode 5 here, it would be great. I have a bad internet connection - I'm not having much luck. 

Have a good week everyone. Hope this podcasts helps you to have a laugh. Hope Ricky sees sense in future, making this podcast free, getting his money from advertising. Not ripping of students that are struggling for cash. "
