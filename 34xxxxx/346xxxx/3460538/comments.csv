,metsapeikko,2006-03-21T15:48Z,"Ok Im not sure is this fake or not, guys in irc says its fake because its too small so......"

,BearishSun,2006-03-21T15:51Z,"I haven't tried it but THIS IS WHAT ALL THE HYPE WAS ABOUT. All files are here, and if this is not it then there wont be a new torrent soon, coz this IS the ind release from usenet.

If it's not it i'm screwed more than most of ya."
,BearishSun,2006-03-21T15:52Z,FILES MISSING ARE THE PARITY FILES(used to recover corrupted archives)
,Quiver77,2006-03-21T15:52Z,"Well, there still isn't a seeder, strange!!! Can anyone tell us the size of the original IND version?"
,haikira,2006-03-21T15:52Z,"For those screaming fake atm note that it culd be compression changing size, and it match's nfo release also so hold your horse's alittle."
,Kajin420,2006-03-21T15:53Z,He didn't post the last 9 files because they're not listed and if you look in the download folder the file syntax is Oblivion-IND.0xx

,IVO1969,2006-03-21T15:54Z,"Here's an idea, try it before you upload."
,Kajin420,2006-03-21T15:54Z,"Slayer, it'd be bigger then demonoid had he posted the parity files...which aren't needed."
,Darth_Alex,2006-03-21T15:55Z,"Seed and this is not complete!!!
Try it BearishSun!"
,BearishSun,2006-03-21T15:55Z,"I don't know how to extract them either, I heard they are split zip files. I have to try something, I'm so hyped I can't breathe"
,krellik,2006-03-21T15:55Z,Dont we need the par files to play this???? ??
,BearishSun,2006-03-21T15:56Z,"IT IS YOUR CHOICE IF YOU DON'T WANT TO DOWNLOAD THIS FILES, WAIT FOR A SCENE CONFIRMED RELEASE THEN"
,SLAYER_OF_ENGLISH,2006-03-21T15:56Z,"would be nice to have the 9x par files just in case,unless of course it is a fake."
,haikira,2006-03-21T15:56Z,open one of the archive files with winrar to extract iso (if this real that it culd be goat pr0n are somthing).
,mnap86,2006-03-21T15:56Z,"ADD THE PAR FILES, WITHOUT EM ITS USELESS!"
,schizimo,2006-03-21T15:56Z,"Bearishsun seems like a nice guy, i belive him when he says this is the real IND release. "
,krellik,2006-03-21T15:57Z,"Yeah come on, why not add the par files??"
,haikira,2006-03-21T15:57Z,"Yeah bear your the first uploader of this game to post in comments and it is relase day, so you have some credit. thanks if its real coz im not a lucky american and cant get for a short while =/"
,SLAYER_OF_ENGLISH,2006-03-21T15:58Z,"yup but everyone reckons everything is a fake...........i`m a fake i am much bigger than i say i am,even in little bits..........

[T],swebarb,2006-03-21T15:59Z,"yeah fuck this, im gonna wait for the big torrent sites to post it instead of this fake shit."
,jrkraken,2006-03-21T16:00Z,Isn't it a bit weird that the uploader hasn't even tried it?
[T],kenoneu,2006-03-21T16:00Z,marry had a little lamb
,zkoa,2006-03-21T16:00Z,"this should be real considering this : http://www.binsearch.info/?server=&b=Oblivion-IND&g=alt.binaries.games&p=Ricochet%40a.b.g+%28Ricochet%29&max=250

and from what i've heard it's not rar files, you need too join the files using hjsplit: http://www.freebyte.com/hjsplit/"
,damnit199,2006-03-21T16:01Z,Ok it is squarely missing the last few files or it is just not the iND release. Read the nfo at nforce.nl and it clearly says 90x50mb files. In this torrent it is 86 something. Definitely missing a few files.
[T],kenoneu,2006-03-21T16:01Z,or is it mary had a little lamb ?
,kely,2006-03-21T16:01Z,"Beszél itt valaki magyarul? Mert elmondhatná valaki érthet?en hogy mi a gyász is folyik ezzel a kibaszott játékkal kapcsolatban, mert ez már gyalázat vazze, sorban jönnek itt a más és más verziók, és akkor most hogy a rákba döntöd el hogy melyik fake meg melyik nem? Hát vazze.... egy játékkal sem volt még ez a balhé, szinte mind már fent volt megjelenés el?tt, erre ez, amit már az egész világ nyálcsorgatva vár, már 2 napja a boltokban van, és még sehol sincsen feltöltve netre, hát kapják be..."
,Zarni,2006-03-21T16:02Z,"Sorry to break it to you nay sayers, but this truly is the ""Ricochet"" Clone

If you would know shit about something, you would know.

You dont have to download it though. Feel free to skip."
,IDontCARE,2006-03-21T16:02Z,all just chill and let bear figure this out... any luck mate? is it working?
,SLAYER_OF_ENGLISH,2006-03-21T16:02Z,"""marry had a little lamb""

It got shagged by a welshman called SLAYER.........."
,KaraTH,2006-03-21T16:02Z,"ul progress shows only 7 more files, wont take much time.
ill wait for a confirmed one, one that has a seeder, because theres not much point in downloading this if you can only get to 2%. "
,Idiot_Savant,2006-03-21T16:02Z,"Lol, this would never have happened if this wasn't ripped by some fucking crackhead in his hut somewhere in the first place."
,haikira,2006-03-21T16:03Z,"""Lol, this would never have happened if this wasn't ripped by some fucking crackhead in his hut somewhere in the first place.""

SOOOOOOOO true lol."
,BearishSun,2006-03-21T16:03Z,"I'm seeding, 500kbps right now man"
,BearishSun,2006-03-21T16:04Z,500KB/s
,krellik,2006-03-21T16:04Z,"have you got it to work yet!!
?"
,mnap86,2006-03-21T16:05Z,"PAR files r to fix broken archives, and yet, theyr not here.... i doubt we could extract without em, already talked that on irc..."
,BearishSun,2006-03-21T16:05Z,1300KB/s TPB doesnt register my as a seeder it seems. But it's uploading
,SLAYER_OF_ENGLISH,2006-03-21T16:05Z,"i`m getting it at 60kb/s and seeding at 15kb/s

but is it a fake ??????  :O)"
,sektor666,2006-03-21T16:05Z,question is - does it work? did you manage to extract the iso from the files? or join them?
,Snicker811,2006-03-21T16:05Z,"Ah, atleast good speed right now.. 500kb/sek to 1.2MB/sek :/"
,Idiot_Savant,2006-03-21T16:05Z,"seeding at 110 steady, getting at random shit rates raging from 27-220-ish. seems to be somwhat steady at 200-ish down now tho."
,polekatt,2006-03-21T16:06Z,"bearishSun thanks for the upload mate...

but you need the last 11 files from usenet for this to be of any use, so get those when they are finished and post another torrent with those 11 files."
,NecroBeator,2006-03-21T16:06Z,"Here is the NFO, or whats in it....

Be careful with these files, as there are AT LEAST two major formats that use this naming system. One we covered already, WinRAR.

But if there's only one file that's missing what's the file? Is it even something important? Maybe there's a chance that you can ignore it, then someone can upload that single file?

Nu laddar jag ner Reloaded istället. De kan det här. Sen köper jag naturligtvis spelet."
,Starcomper,2006-03-22T17:58Z,"Hur läser man egentligen .nfo filer, när jag försöker öppna dom så står det bara att den kanske är skadad eller av ökänt format, hur gör jag?"

,lazlo4,2006-03-23T15:19Z,"Hi! 

I have the Tes4oblivion_IND version from bearish. Is there anyone else than me who has a problem playing it? My setup is a 2.4 ghz intel with 512 ram and a atiradeon atlantis 9600 graphic card. The problem is that even if I set all settings on off and Low it still lags like hell. Is there something wrong with that release or what? Others tell me that the retail version works without any flaws at similar systems. 

Again, could it be that The TES¤Oblivion-IND version is damaged in som way?"
,lazlo4,2006-03-23T15:42Z," I´m over the minimi spec and I definently don´t think that it would lag this much, If I had bought the game i don´t know what i would do, probably demand my money back, it´s false marketing. Instead they should have set the minimi requirment to the recommended level. 

It´s false marketing by Bethesda and if these versions are fully functional Bethesda is tricking ppl to buy this game... 

IT WON´T WORK WITH MINIMI SYSTEM REQUIREMENT....Damn Frustrating!!!"
,Starcomper,2006-03-23T16:31Z,"Lazlo4: Try downloading this fix to the TES4Oblivion-iND torrent, both are from BearishSun so you shouldn't have any problems. More than that i cannot help you.
One more thing: START SEEDING if don't."
,Starcomper,2006-03-23T16:32Z,Here is the adress to the fix: http://thepiratebay.org/details.php?id=3460711
,lazlo4,2006-03-23T16:38Z,"is that fix newer than the first one? cause I alredy have the game installed and I can play it,but somethings got to be wrong with it cause it lags even with every setting on low. But it only lags in the ""big world""... I can play in dungeons and such places"
,anden,2006-03-23T17:53Z,"Hmmm... ive downloadet this torrent.. but winrar says that the file is either unknown or damaged... did anyone else havde this problem??? 

its freaking annoying i have to download it all again :( 

hope someone can help! :)"
,Starcomper,2006-03-23T18:26Z,"Try downloading the fix at this page: http://thepiratebay.org/details.php?id=3460711 and read the instructions carefully, more than that i cannot help you."
,Starcomper,2006-03-23T18:52Z,"Lazlo4: It might be your ram memory or your graphics card or mayby even your processor that might be to slow, so check the game requirements on Bethseda's homepage(Google: Bethsoft ) and if you dont match them maybe you should by a new graphics card/ram-memory/processor. I dunno."

Then I started the CMD and wrote || C:gnuwin32binbsdtar -xf D:Oblivion-IND.tar.gz Oblivion.mdf when the mdf is finished then the same but whit mds at the END
