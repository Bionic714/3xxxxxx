NOTES:
I received this in a trade. It's straight from the original cassette which was bought in Gothenburg. I did some internet searching and can find no mention of this cassette anywhere, and the guy I got it from said that it was 'probably only ever issued in Gothenburg since NO ONE knows about it.' He also 'tried to make the sound better'... not quite sure what that means, but other than being recorded a little hot (especially the vocals), it sounds amazing. I tracked this in Wavelab (it was a single file), applied some Waves X-Click to reduce the digital noise from the overdriven vocals, and normalized the show down to 97% to reduce clipping. I would rate this an A- soundwise.
