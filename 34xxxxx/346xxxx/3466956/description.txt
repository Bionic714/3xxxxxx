In one day, businesswoman Maryse loses her job, finds out that her husband has left her for her best friend and gets a call telling her that her mother, subject to periods of confusion, has been caught shoplifting. Maryse decides to drop everything to take care of her mother, who has been diagnosed with Alzheimer's Disease. She opens a boarding house for pensioners who can no longer live on their own. Each one who comes to stay has his or her own eccentricities, including René, a film lover who goes everywhere by tricycle; Émilienne, the eternal ingénue; Georgette and her everlasting cigarette; the refined Luce and the greedy Miss Clairol.
