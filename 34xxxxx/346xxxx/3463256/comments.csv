,Lazypie,2006-03-28T16:40Z,"Thanks!
I will try to reeseed to 1,00 ratio :)"
,Furazela,2006-03-29T18:47Z,"Xavier_II: Oups, didn't even notice. Thanks!"
,Cpt Archer,2006-04-26T04:28Z,"sweet, 
definatly a forgotten clasic
will definatly be seeding this for ages to come"
,MysticDragonfly,2006-05-01T09:55Z,"I saw that 2x11, 2x13 and 2x14 is gone, do you have them to?"
,phobos258,2006-05-23T04:04Z,awesome.
,Furazela,2006-05-25T11:08Z,"Looks like some comments have disappeared, so I'm re-stating some information:

Lazypie and other leechers: 1.00 ratio isn't good enough. If noone continue to seed after 1.00 BT won't work. Myself I ALWAYS continue to a ratio of 2.00, and sometimes I even reach a ratio of about 250.0. However, if you only have an asynchronous line, such as ADSL, I can understand if you stop at a ratio of 1.50 or thereabouts."
,Furazela,2006-05-25T11:11Z,"MysticDragonfly: No, unfortunately I don't. However Xavier_II is seeding 2x11 at http://thepiratebay.org/details.php?id=3463309"
,Furazela,2006-05-25T11:11Z,"I'd love if someone owning the DVDs would seed at least 2x07, 2x11, 2x13, 2x14, 3x08 and 3x09 (the  missing and low quality ones)."
,Sobbsy,2006-08-11T01:41Z,"Thankyou very much for all the seeding you've done so far....

Is there anyone else in a position to help seed? I was stunned to find this show again and it's taken about 5 or 6 days to get 650mb :(

Thanks!"
,Furazela,2006-08-13T17:45Z,"I'll start seeding again. I had hooped that this torrent had become self-sufficient.

PLEASE, everyone downloading:
Continue seeding until you have a ration of AT LEAST 1.50
My ratio on this torrent is ~40, and I never stop seeding anything I download until I reach 2.00"
,Sobbsy,2006-08-17T09:08Z,"Thankyou for helping seed..

You'd hope it'd be self-sufficient by now, but sadly not. I'm connected to 4 seeds and 113 peers...getting a max speed of 7kb/s at the best of times :( Taken a good week to get to 2.3%"
,Night Shadow,2006-09-06T07:11Z,Thx
,Sobbsy,2006-12-06T18:12Z,"All this time and i'm still only just tipping 40%...

Really wish we had some quality seeders. Argh, will I ever get to watch Seaquest again...without paying ridiculous amounts for dvds?! :P"
,Sobbsy,2007-01-29T04:11Z,"Just wanted to say thankyou to whoever that seeder is that's pumping out the speed (running Azereus 2.5.0.4 whoever you are). Thanks to you, i'm finally getting somewhere with this torrent, just tipped the 61% mark a bit earlier.

I'll pretty much seed this down to the last user once i've got it. Also, if no one else is onto it, I should have eps 7, 11, 13 and 14 from season 2 by tomorrow, and can create a torrent for that."
,axcairns,2007-03-13T12:11Z,"Sobbsy, could you seed 2x07? i-man1eMule's mislabelled torrent appears to be dead."
,leif-glenn,2007-04-08T14:20Z,"Tnx allot for this one, one of the last big things Jonathan Brandis did before his tragic suicide in 2003 i believe....bot forget those bad thoughts, it is stil a great series, i like Roy Scheider."
,leif-glenn,2007-04-15T14:19Z,"Ok...up and seeding at 1.3mb/s, seeded 80gb so far...will continue until there are more seeders to take over ...cheers!!! ;)"
,andy12gr,2007-06-05T17:53Z,"do you have the Greek subtitles of the movie ""seaquest""?"
,foofersgod,2007-10-13T00:45Z,hey thanks for this.  i've tried to get season 3 for weeks and i got to 75.3% and they took the torrent off.  this is a classic.  too bad they aren't making the dvds for it.
,Ravenmaster1984,2008-01-03T23:16Z,Anyone have seaquest I think it was 2051?
,natje25,2008-01-13T17:29Z,thank was looking for this
,lilith77,2008-01-13T23:33Z,Seasons 1 and 2 are both available on DVD.  You can find them on amazon.  Although this is a great way to get to see the series while saving up to buy the DVDs.  Thanks :)
,mrlee30,2008-01-21T22:42Z,Can you please seed Seaquest season 12 and 3 again?
,lilith77,2008-01-29T16:54Z,"Seed, please.  I've been trying to download this for weeks now!  I don't even have a GB downloaded yet.  Thanks!"
,lilith77,2008-03-17T06:32Z,"Where are all the seeders?  Come on folks, I've been trying to finish downloading this for almost two months now!  Yes, you read right... two months!  Please and thank you!"
,gildemar,2008-09-19T21:56Z,"Thanks! Thanks! Thanks! The hugest THANKS!!! Please, do not leave from distribution! Russian will not forget you, comrades!
P.S.: thanks PROMT :) "
,Shaothemerciful,2009-05-24T16:07Z,Can we get some more seeders? I'm stuck at 95.8% and only getting like 1.6k.....
,darlakk,2009-07-24T07:35Z,Ted Raimi....awesome....
,zen-TAO,2009-08-02T05:31Z,"From the comments it seems
useless to start DL.

I am thankfull, its not that, but I am
also against these HUGE torrents wich
only give us problems to DL.

(Some people UL torrents 
that are like 50 Gbs for example... 
Not good...)

Maybe better to UL season by season?

Peace and Love!"
,truthy,2009-09-27T22:41Z,"thx for sharing!

all episodes are TV-Rips from Sci-Fi - quality is watchable aside from a few exceptions"
,sweet1627,2010-01-15T22:48Z,thanks 4 the upload but there is an episode missing in season 2 (episode 11 dead end)
,kaosrampage,2010-02-02T04:34Z,Seed Please
,waistland,2010-02-22T05:58Z,Thanks I have watched season 1 and 2 and getting 3 now and this might have been forgotten by some but not all and a classic it is:D Thanks Furazela
,waistland,2010-02-22T06:01Z,zen-TAO and I don't know what your talking about I have not had problems pulling in one season at a time yes it takes a while but dam you cant find this any where else and worth any time it takes to be able to watch it one last time!
,axilleaszz,2010-08-13T07:35Z,thanks
,Tryst49,2010-10-28T09:40Z,Can someone please upload S02E11 to complete this set?
,Furazela,2010-11-23T21:11Z,"For Tryst49 and everyone else wanting the missing episodes, I did you one better and uploaded the complete series in much better quality.

Well, most of Season 3 are in fact the same, but episode 8 and 9 are vastly improved.

Season 1: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5979569
Season 2: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5979570
Season 3: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5979571"
,eclectik,2010-12-31T23:01Z,Where are the seeders at? PLZ SEED!
,hauntnut,2011-01-30T13:17Z,"This sucks, really. This is an incomplete collection of the episodes, but they are in a format that I can play on my external player. The links to the torrents for the complete seasons are in PAL format, which I cannot play in my external player. Seriously, thanks for the effort, but get it together and put the missing episodes on this collection as well. It's just sloppy not to."
,mgroc,2011-04-17T21:24Z,Fake Porn problem: unfinished pilot part 1 plays a Rocco movie in bad quality.
,mgroc,2011-04-17T21:25Z,Furazela say something to that.
,mgroc,2011-04-17T21:42Z,SOLVED. Player + Windows issue. Incomplete files get old deleted data.
