A forgotten classic.

From IMDB:
By the mid-21st Century, humankind has colonized the oceans and formed the UEO (United Earth Oceans Organization) as a military organization to police it. Formerly a high-ranking member of the UEO, Nathan Bridger retired after the death of his wife, and retreated to an isolated island to study dolphins. When an attempt is made to hijack the SeaQuest DSV, the UEO's most powerful undersea vessel, Nathan, its original designer, is convinced to return to active service to assume command of it.
The series has New Age leanings, often presenting stories that deal with environmental issues or mix myth and mysticism, from ghosts to gods, into its science fiction.

This torrent is preserved for posterity only. It has several missing episodes and some of the episodes that are included are of dubious quality.

I strongly recommend everyone to grab my new torrents instead:
