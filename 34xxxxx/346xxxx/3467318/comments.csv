,betty2662,2006-07-22T17:24Z,This is awesome. Does anyone know how to convert this to DVD. I can only watch this on my computer. I would like to burn in on DVD.
,Zorbutsushu,2006-07-25T15:18Z,You can convert them directly to VOB format and burn them to DVD using WIAVI Video Converter. I suggest no more than 4 episodes per DVD.

,Zorbutsushu,2006-07-27T01:43Z,"Spotted the typing error on my last post, use WINAVI Video Converter."
,Sauron81,2006-08-07T19:58Z,I use Power Producer 3 to make DVD's and i works great . You can fit in 4 episodes on one dvd without losing quality.

Just recently watched season 1 & 2 and currently watching seaons number three, and this does not make any sense what so ever. Could be that some of the episodes are in a incorrect order? Anyone know if episode number three is actually episode number three?"
