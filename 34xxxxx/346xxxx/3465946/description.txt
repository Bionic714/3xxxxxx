Lyrics:
piece by piece
I release
once was mine
now undone
turned blue like New
Orleans
and went down like
a southern sun
I still feel you
beneath my skin
I am tempted
to throw my senses in
?cos its easier to fly
than to face another night in southern sun
and your love is all around
(x2)
in the air to set me free
set me free
you last like a song
I'm deflated
I am pieces on the wind
unrelated
I still feel you
beneath my skin
I am tempted
to throw my senses in
?cos its easier to fly
than to face another night in southern sun
and your love is all around
in the air to set me free
set me free
?cos its easier to fly
set me free

Lyrics
Time of your life
Time of you life now
Time of your life
Time of you life now
Time of your life
Time of you life now

Woke up this morning with a head full of snow. Was it a dream.
Picked up me body for the ride of a lifetime is what it seemed.
Hope got me started. Put you to the centre, so it seemed.
Don?t you hurry ?cause you?ll reach your goals, is what it reads.
Got caught in the rain and it washed all my senses down the drain.
Drop me a line when you?re given the time and we?ll talk some more.

Woke up this morning with a head full of snow.
Was it a dream? Don?t you worry cause you?ll reach your goals is what it reads.

This is the time of you life
This is the time of you life now
This is the time of you life
This is the time of you life now 

Picked up my mail to the 1040 exit to the streets
Drew some money then shook hands with the angel next to me.
Caught in the rain and it washed all my senses down the drain.
Woke up this morning with a head full of snow. Was it a dream?

This is the time of you life
This is the time of you life now
This is the time of you life
This is the time of you life

This is the time of you life
This is the time of you life now
This is the time of you life
This is the time of you life

This is the time of you life
This is the time of you life now
This is the time of you life
This is the time of you life

?.To fade?.

Lyrics:
You came in from the darkness and held the door open wide
You stood there like a vision before my unbelieving eyes
I believe in what I see and also what I hear
But did the night play tricks on me or were you really there.

Am I being Hypnotised 
Feeling like I?m Hypnotised
Am I being Hypnotised 
Feeling like I?m Hypnotised

Fear has gripped my heart and I am whispering out your name 
Can you hear the silence screaming do they sound the same

Am I being Hypnotised 
Feeling like I?m Hypnotised
Am I being Hypnotised 
Feeling like I?m Hypnotised

Am I being Hypnotised 
Feeling like I?m Hypnotised
Am I being Hypnotised 
Feeling like I?m Hypnotised

You came in from the darkness and held the door open wide
You stood there like a vision before my unbelieving eyes
I believe in what I see and also what I hear
But did the night play tricks on me or were you really there.

Am I being Hypnotised 
Feeling like I?m Hypnotised
Am I being Hypnotised 
Feeling like I?m Hypnotised

Lyrics
Girl: "This is a message for Paul Oakenfold...eh...how are you? Its Anita Baymont Hunter Thompson?s assistant, I'm going through the messages, just getting back to you to let you know that Hunter did get the CD's, I've listened to them and I'm excited and Hunter has listened to them and ... he is interested. So eh we'll give you call back in a couple of days, yeah so um great stuff we'll talk soon thanks bye."

Hunter: "Let me just read this."

"Nixon?s spirit will be with us for the rest of our lives whether your are me or Bill Clinton or you or Kurt Cobain or Bishop Tutu or Keith Richards or Aimee Fisher or Boris Yeltsin?s daughter or her finance's sixteen year old beer drunk brother with his braided goatee with his whole like a thunder cloud right in front of him."

"This is not a generational thing you don't even have to know who Richard Nixon was to be a victim of his ugly nazi experiments."

"He has poisoned our water for ever. Nixon will be remembered as a classic case of a smart man shitting in his own nest, but he also shit in our nest and that was the crime that history will burn on his memory as a brand. By disgracing and degrading the presidency of the United States, by fleeing the White House like a diseased cur, Richard Nixon broke the heart of the American Dream..."

Lyrics:
Maybe I find it hard
Watching you live
Maybe I find the truth
Questions I can?t bare
Feeling so tired
I?m wondering where
Selfish love inspires
Are you there to hold my hand
Saving me who I spy

Maybe you are the rain
Who makes my eyes closed
Ocean?s grey and grey
Feeling my despair
Your happy smile is broken
I?m wondering there
Selfish love has spoken

Are you here to hold
Are you there to hold my hand
Selfish love has spoken
Saving me who I spy
Are you here to hold
Are you there to hold my hand
Selfish love has spoken
Saving me who I spy
Are you here to hold
Are you there to hold my hand
Selfish love has spoken
Saving me who I spy

Lyrics
Oooh La La
I see stars
I?m seeing stars x6

Once again, I find myself with my friends, dancing the night away,
Its like the party never ends.
Then again we don?t want it to stop, ?cause tonight?s the night it goes sweatbox, laser beams, flashing lights, wild cards, 
Men from Mars, dressed in Stars and stripes,
Eclectic electric
Ladies of the evening 
drinking booze and mingling ?..

Mashing to the music, I can do anything
Freaky dicky star speckles and pink butterflies
and life is nice, so nice.
I walk into a club and I?ve found paradise,
I?m seeing stars, I can?t believe my eyes.

Oh my starry eyed surprise, sundown to sunrise,
I dance all night, we?re gonna dance all night, dance all night to this DJ.
Ah Sugar, dance all night to this DJ.
Oh my starry eyed surprise, sundown to sunrise,
Dance all night, we?re gonna dance all night, dance all night to this DJ,
Ah Sugar, dance all night to this DJ, dance all night to this DJ, lover dance all night to this DJ.

Like the record spins on the trails we blaze
The walls are closing in but that?s ok because I?ve been waiting all week to feel this way and it feels so good, so good. 
I?m on top of the world the coolest kid in the neighbourhood 
So let me be your star for one night that?s right.
Sweatbox, laser beams, flashing lights, you?ve got to feel the rush, feel the spice of life.
Love-life, Shifty rolls the dice snake eyes surprise.
Iceing..Mesmorizing. the minds are sick ones ?cause what we are, is victims of fun. 
Come on, come on, the fun is just begun; come on the fun is just begun. Ha Ha!!

Oh my starry eyed surprise, sundown to sunrise,
dance all night, we?re gonna dance all night, dance all night to this DJ.
Ah Sugar, dance all night to this DJ.
Oh my starry eyed surprise, sundown to sunrise,
Dance all night, we?re gonna dance all night, dance all night to this DJ,
Ah Sugar, dance all night to this DJ, dance all night to this DJ, lover dance all night to this DJ.

It goes 
Oooh la la
I see stars
I?m seeing stars x2

Oh my starry eyed surprise, sundown to sunrise,
I dance all night, we?re gonna dance all night, dance all night to this DJ.
Ah Sugar, dance all night to this DJ.
Oh my starry eyed surprise, sundown to sunrise,
Dance all night, we?re gonna dance all night, dance all night to this DJ,
Ah Sugar, dance all night to this DJ, dance all night to this DJ, sugar dance all night to this DJ, dance all night to this DJ.

Lyrics:
Mmmmm
He won?t come down never
He won?t come down
He won?t come down never
He won?t come down 

He won?t come down
He won?t come down

When your it heart beats heavy for a drum?.
No you won?t come down easy let me run?.
When you long to reach heaven where the night is young
All the stars above you are in?

Motion now, motion now
Your feeling so alive
Motion now, Motion now tonight
Motion now, motion now
Your feeling so alive
Motion now, Motion now tonight
Ooooooh

In the neon blue city
In the twilight fields
See the ballroom Dance floor
Only there has heat
Anyone can feel it

Motion now, motion now
You feel so alive
Motion now, Motion now tonight
Motion now, motion now
You feel so alive
Motion now, Motion now tonight

Oooooo

Motion now, motion now
You feel so alive
Motion now, Motion now tonight
Motion now, motion now
You feel so alive
Motion now, Motion now tonight
Oooooo

Lyrics
Ooh?
The harder they come

Maybe love is not for me
Maybe lovers dream things that I don?t dream
Maybe oh, maybe

Maybe you are just a little boy
Ask again you want a pride and joy
Maybe I should set you free

The harder they come
The harder they fall
Baby, maybe I would rather not go there at all
The harder they come
The harder they fall
Maybe I would rather not come here at all

See what comes ?round
The harder they come


The harder they come
The harder they fall
Baby, maybe I would rather not go there at all
The harder they come
The harder they fall

The harder they come

Come here at all?
