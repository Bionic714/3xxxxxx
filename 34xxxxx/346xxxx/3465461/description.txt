What would happen if the world were to start running out of
oil? Conventional wisdom says we?ve got 30 years, but there?s a
growing fear amongst petroleum experts it?s happening much sooner

oil now. So how soon will the oil run out, and can we stop our economy
collapsing when it does? How prepared are we for the real oil crisis?
