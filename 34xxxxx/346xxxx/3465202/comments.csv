After completion of the setup, nothing has been installed. It restart WLM and that's all is does.

Maybe it only works on the english version, because  there is also no support for other languages in the setup."

No beta version of Messenger Plus! Live has been leaked to the public so please, do not download anything that's named ""MsgPlusLive 4.0"" as a virus is currently circulating under that very name. This virus will cause many undesirable things to happen to your system including the complete removal of your contact list. In case of doubt, never download Messenger Plus! from any other source than this web site."
