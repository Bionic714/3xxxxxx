[b]SYNOPSIS[/b]

In this movie Fellini portrays his home town of Rimini as he remembered it in '30s, during his young days. Many bizzare but very warm and human characters and specific Mediterranean humor made this movie the most popular of all Fellini's works.
....................
In this carnivalesque portrait of provincial Italy during the Fascist period, Fellini satirizes his youth and turns daily life into a circus of rituals, sensations and emotions. Adolescent desires, male fantasies, and political repartee are set to Nina Rota?s music in this beautiful transfer of Amarcord.
