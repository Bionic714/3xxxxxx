,gravediggerZ,2009-04-27T13:39Z,"what's other languanges on the subtitle info.
could you please be more specific on what those other languages are"
,tooticki,2010-02-09T04:28Z,"OK. Took me 4 days to get this down but now I know what it is.

Disk 1 (AMARCORD) is the movie.
Disk 2 (Amarcord 2) contain extras.

See the enclosed covers with details here: http://bayimg.com/bakcMaACF

I haven't burnt it yet, just checked it out in VLC, but I do not get all the language options listed on the cover. I get the following.

Ideaomas (which I guess means soundtrack choices):
English, Deutsch, Castellano, Magyar, Italiano

SubtĂ­tulos:
English, Deutsch, Castellano, Magyar, FranĂ§ais Italiano

I don't see how burning could change this, but if it does I'll post again."
,tooticki,2010-02-09T06:19Z,"Well, burning made a difference. The other languages turned up in BS Player's menu after burning, but they still aren't available from the DVD menu itself. Everything seems to work."
