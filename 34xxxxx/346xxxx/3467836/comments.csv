,Foxxen,2006-04-07T17:40Z,"Same game, but already extracted. Instead of several rarfiles, this one is a 4.6 GB iso file."
,snuttens,2006-04-07T17:40Z,it's not compressed with winrar....just one big iso-file...
,DarkVenom,2006-04-07T18:17Z,"Merci beaucoup !!

,gazzario22,2006-04-07T20:57Z,first upload..doesnt appear to b working...any advice welcome...sorry
,hackthex06,2006-04-08T02:09Z,this is a dvd9 so you cant burn it to a dvd-r. Try a verbatim dual layer dvd+r. And use DVD decrypter to burn the iso. Works for me everytime.
