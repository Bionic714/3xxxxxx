USE AT OWN RISK.

There."
,gus90001,2006-04-08T16:09Z,Abnormalia - older versions of wintasks have had a virus that turned my Norton virus protection off and done what else? Thanks for the upload anyway.  :)
,Abnormalia,2006-04-10T05:13Z,"Nevermind, found the trojan. It installs an internet explorer search bar, and probably does other things. 

Don't download :(.
