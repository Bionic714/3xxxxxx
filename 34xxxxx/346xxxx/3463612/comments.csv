,Sniper1935,2006-03-29T12:43Z,"This should be in the PSP section *NOT* PS2! I was about to dl this until I saw the fw1.5 :( Nice to see some helpfull info in the details section though, makes a change as some people put the most useless info (such as ""good movie"") there lol :)"
,B-manSwe,2006-03-30T17:57Z,so what is a psp-game doing under the ps2-section?
,robban__3,2006-04-03T17:21Z,"Hmmm i must be doing something wrong because wen i puch X it starts the ""real"" umd (in my case Rige Racer). 
I have downloaded worms & YS withe the same fix and i get it to work but thats is only because there a shortcut in the x:/psp/game folder (worms,worms% or ys,ys%). 

Is it not supose to be an SF3A and SF3A% in ther to ??  =) "
