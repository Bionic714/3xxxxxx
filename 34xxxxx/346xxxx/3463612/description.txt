Just copy paste the extracted 3 folders to the root of your memorystick. Start RunUMD and press X(no need to press O). You're good to go.

Note: These files are already patched. No need of changing. Just copy paste and play. By 'Yoshaw'.

Thanks to those who made the fix available at ps2nfo and uber thanks to those who made the fix(Mr. W).

Note: Doesn't save but who cares for that. The game plays fine and It's just a 2D fighter!
