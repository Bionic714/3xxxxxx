,j4gg3r,2007-02-12T15:06Z,"Im getting it from eMule. SAME AVI FILES 30 seeds!

,j4gg3r,2007-02-17T23:36Z,"This will be seeded by me starting next week.
Probably stilll 10-14 days till you get 100% of my slow upload."
,j4gg3r,2007-02-23T04:12Z,"Now I'm hashing 99.9% with 2 pieces(1MB) missing from CD2.avi. 
My AVI does check out 100% correct file length
with GSpot. And exact same size as the original in this torrent.

Should still be OK to watch, but if any one wants to complete what I have 100% with a new hash torrent to try and get that last 1MB let me know.

I'll post a new torrent with new hash that should just download the last 2 pieces. Or maybe even adjoing pieces too.

If you say nothing at all, I'll just asume your happy with 99.9%."
,j4gg3r,2007-02-26T06:46Z,"99.99% CD2 fix

http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3626957

Copy your current incomplete CD2 to a temp folder and point this new torrent to it.
Do not start from 0% again. Unless I post again saying I'll seed all of CD2.

Seeder will never be more than a few hours away so leave your client open if no seed."
,j4gg3r,2007-02-27T13:34Z,"Doh!,  can't anyone follow instructions? the simplest instructions? Looks like im needlessly seeding 700MB again for a 3MB fix. Double Doh!!

Surely some of you still have 99.99% and can point the new torrent to that folder and finish CD2 in 5 minutes. It's not hard. Then you can seed this for the one's who think it is hard!"
,spiff142,2007-02-27T17:43Z,"I'm at 99.8%. If someone seeds me up,  I'll seed from 0% for the Idiots."
,spiff142,2007-02-27T17:54Z,Mad props to whomever hooked me up!
,MasterKaz,2007-09-18T06:15Z,"Not to sound to noobish.. How do I redirrect the torrent?

I am using utorrent and have copied the file to another dir, but cant seem to find the location on how to tell it to redirrect.. 

Thanx"
,monkeystuff68,2007-12-17T00:06Z,"I could not transfer the incomplete file and use it for the 99.9% torrent because that torrent is not a folder but a torrent-file... HOWEVER, I was able to successfully launch the CD2 file which is apparently only 98.9% percent done... The movie still played and VLC gave me no error. I scrolled towards the end of the movie, and it does run to the very end! So, it seems that the ""patch"" is not necessary, after all!"
,yarrrrr,2010-01-01T13:18Z,can anyone seed this? 99.9%...
