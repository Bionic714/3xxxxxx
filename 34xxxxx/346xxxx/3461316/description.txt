$$  With PartitionMagic, you can quickly and easily create partitions on    $$
$$  your hard disks for storing valuable information such as data files,    $$
$$  applications, and operating systems. Storing information in separate    $$
$$  partitions helps you organize and protect your data and reclaim wasted  $$
$$  disk space. PartitionMagic enables you to secure your data by           $$
$$  physically separating it from other files. Separate partitions also     $$
$$  make backups easy. Because of limitations with the FAT file system, as  $$
$$  much as 40 percent of your hard disk space can be wasted. Partition     $$
$$  Magic reclaims wasted space quickly and safely by using more officient  $$
$$  partition sizes. It can also convert FAT partitions to FAT32 ant vice   $$
$$  versa. In addition to powerful partitioning features, PartitionMagic    $$
$$  offers a variety of other options. For instance, you can perform        $$
$$  partitioning operations and view the changes that will be made before   $$
$$  applying them to your system. Additionally, you can view comprehensive  $$
$$  information about your hard disk geometry and your hardware system, and $$
$$ you can resize root directories (FAT,FAT32) to make room for more long   $$
$$                                   filenames.                             $$
