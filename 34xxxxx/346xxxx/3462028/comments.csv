,allmypeople,2006-05-28T22:35Z,These HD rips are absolutely fantastic. Many thanks.
,airnpar,2007-07-22T13:08Z,I have downloaded this 3 times and don't have any sound... any Ideas?
,ekin09,2007-08-09T21:19Z,no sound....
,baboonbob,2007-12-16T04:31Z,"If you get no sound on a torrent, sometimes you will if you ""open with"" DIVX Player, which is easy to get for free. That also sometimes works if you get sound, but no picture."
,duke755,2008-02-03T23:17Z,i tried divX but doens't works has anyone figuerd it out?
,rimshot_777,2008-03-04T00:47Z,"I'm sure there're other solutions, but the one I found that worked was downloading a player called MPCStar (http://mpcstar.com)

I hope that works for you too! Good luck."
,igorstravin,2008-03-31T19:14Z,"I prefer to watch these on my TV & my dvd player works with the smaller files but these that are double the size show no picture, just sound.  why is this?"
,gymlis,2008-04-23T14:28Z,"might have something to do with the fact that this is a HD file and not a regular DVDRIP, but not sure tho"
,arisuta,2009-01-30T16:26Z,VLC download seems to play just about anything.
,Shaothemerciful,2009-03-27T16:34Z,Seed please! stuck at ~82%
