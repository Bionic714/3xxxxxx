,klasse2,2006-07-22T22:19Z,the multiplayer!! ĂŠeeh!
,Twinbird24,2006-08-26T04:53Z,"Holy shit. Custom Edition is just the name the poeple gave the mutliplay mack pack. It's just a bunch of modded multiplayer maps. What don't you get. And also, how do you seed?"
,Twinbird24,2006-08-26T16:32Z,"I got these definitions off the Internet by using Google search (www.google.com). It's really simple once you get it. If you don't get it, ream if over again:

--What is a seeder?

A seed(er) is a client on the BT network that has a complete copy of a particular archive. For any archive to work, there must be at least one seed to download from originally. Sometimes under certain circumstances, there may be no one seeder but enough people with all the parts to make up the whole archive, this is called a distributed copy. It is HIGHLY recommended that once you have gotten an archive you leave the BT client running for at least the amount of time that it took you to download the archive to help ensure that others will also be able to get it. Share and Share alike! 


--What is a leecher?

A leech(er) is a client on the BT network that does not have a complete copy of a particular archive yet. When any new client begins downloading an archive, they are a leecher until they have finished downloading the entire archive and then become a seeder. The name 'leecher' here is an unfortunate use that has become too commonly used even though it is really not applicable to what the meaning is. A leecher normally means someone who downloads without uploading (takes but does not give.) But here, a leecher is part of the network and is uploading as well, many times more KB than they download. But hey, it's worth the new meaning once you appreciate the vast resources that BT brings to you. 

--What is a .torrent file?

To download something with BitTorrent, you must have a .torrent file. This file contains in it a location that tells the BitTorrent client where to go to find the tracker that manages the uploading and downloading of the archive. An archive is a complete set for downloading which may include one file or many files. The one .torrent file contains the archive information also. To download on this network it is simply a matter of clicking on the .torrent file in your web browser, then the BitTorrent client kicks in and asks where you'd like to save the archive. That's it, from there you just sit back and watch the client work it's magic. "

,HellRock,2007-11-11T05:50Z,Aiight I'd like to ask... does this require xbox softmodding? I'd also appreciate a seed. Thanks.
,jeezy103,2007-11-23T13:52Z,"@HellRock...
it does require softmodding, unless ur xbox can read burned game-discs....
AND, the maps aren't modded.......think of this as the entire halo 2 game minus the campaign..
