Long video presentation by some guy who claims the famous moon landing(s?)
never took place and was staged. 
Funny enough, he does point out a number of very interesting oddities and
inconsistencies in the original moon landing films, like a mountain that
looks exactly the same and has the same lightfall as it did when they walked 
toward it in the opposite direction, just to name something.
For the conspiracy lover. ;-)
- the truth is out there!
