,JOHN_RAMBO,2006-04-06T19:35Z,"Please INFO about ISO.
Why download this, when 8hours ago is there another torrent:
 ""Civ4-with-crack-and-patch1.52.iso""
http://thepiratebay.org/details.php?id=3467207"
,libradert,2006-04-07T00:29Z,"if you don't want to download it, that's fine with me, i'm not pointing a gun at anyone. i do not include any patch with this game, download it yourself from firaxis' website, and there is no  cracked exe file, instead use the mini images included inside the iso and anti safedisk 4 loader which is also included, read the txt inside the iso for instruction. this way civ 4 exe file is not altered which makes patching a lot easier, also i found civ 4 to be more stable this way."
,Faraz956,2006-04-21T12:46Z,oh boy the torrent john_rambo said suxxxx... everybody who had downloaded it said that it dosent work
,Mr_Pyro,2006-07-14T23:36Z,"Libradert: I've been away from the ""grid"" for quite a while. Not familiar with the tools that you use to install/crack the game. I presume that I should point CureROM to the civ4 exe, prob is that I don't know the name of the exe prior to installing the game, or is installing the game ya first yar first step?"
,TvLover35,2007-02-06T03:58Z,"What's this antisafe disk 4 loader you mentioned? I don't see it anywhere in that crack file. Unless you are referring to CureROM, in which case I have to say there seem to be some steps missing here in the readme file. Can someone please explain this for those who are not familiar with CureROM?"
,Darkix,2008-07-26T05:42Z,"Hmn.
There's one seed, and I'm not connect to him/her.
If it ever finishes, I'll seed all the time. =]"
