,ApostleOfHim,2006-11-22T14:18Z,"This version dont have 100 maps. When I completed the 7th level, the game is done. How do i do to get the 100 levels?"
,Vsardar,2011-01-23T12:21Z,Hi. I've actually downloaded the demo version before. My wife and I both love playing this game. Used to love playing it on the arcade games back in about 1991. Thanks very much for this posting.
,Vsardar,2011-01-23T12:24Z,"Oh, one more thing. ApostelofHim, please ensure you register the game in order to go beyond level 7. I'm guessing you're playing the unregistered version. The download comes with a torrent key. Load the game and click on register. There's an option to load the reg key from a txt file. The txt file is in the folder you downloaded, not the installation folder. Hope that helps."
