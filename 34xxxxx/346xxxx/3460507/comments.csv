,FulciLives,2008-06-20T21:41Z,"I downloaded this but I am not impressed. The main thing I dislike about this is that it is an older version of the guide. On the front it says ""FOR PC AND XBOX 360"" and after looking at the table of contents this only covers the ORIGINAL game release. It does not cover any of the extras (which were released separately and then eventually all-in-one with the release of the GAME OF THE YEAR edition).

Another annoying thing is that each page was scanned as graphics so there is no real text so you can't search on text or cut out text to a text editor. Also the quality of the scans aren't that great but it works well enough.

I'd look elsewhere ... I'm sure the full complete GAME OF THE YEAR edition must be on here or somewhere in digital form."
,FulciLives,2008-06-20T21:50Z,"I forgot to add that I found a most wonderful website chock full of information about OBLIVION and here is the link: http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Main_Page

That website actually covers ALL of the ELDER SCROLLS games. Most of the content though seems to be about MORROWIND and OBLIVION and in the case of OBLIVION it covers all the extras (as found in the GAME OF THE YEAR EDITION) and also talks about some specific things in regard to the various versions, i.e., the PC, XBOX 360 and PS3 versions.

Great website !!!"
