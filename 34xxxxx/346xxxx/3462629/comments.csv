Nobody knows how the false activation works... It simply just does...

I havent experienced any problems yet...

But if any errors occur... POST HERE!!!"
,ZoReX(zRx),2006-03-27T01:11Z,"Also look at this: 
http://thepiratebay.org/details.php?id=3462629     - Norton AntiVirus 2006 
http://thepiratebay.org/details.php?id=3462631     - ZoneAlarm Pro 6"
,ZoReX(zRx),2006-03-27T01:35Z,"NOTE: If you get infected with SpySheriff... Then your Windows is doomed!

No antivirus application can save you then!

Not even this one!
Dont waste time downloading for this reason!
Reinstall your Windows... Nothing else to do..."
,deltman,2006-03-27T05:36Z,"I still use the old Norton AntiVirus (before symantec zapped everyone). BUT i turn LiveUpdate OFF. On a weekly basis, i just download the signature file from the web site and run the EXE to bring it up to date."
[V],MooBoy,2006-03-27T13:43Z,"I have cleaned 2 computers who was infected with ""SpySheriff"". It was a hard race. I started with Adaware (latest and free) and then Spybot (latest and also free). Finaly I used ""Spyware Doctor"" (Not free...) butt you find it here...

,ZoReX(zRx),2006-03-27T13:53Z,"Thank you!

,Jonny_ekholm,2006-04-29T08:28Z,in cmd and then change the value so spysheriff cant change the background( or it was spysheriff changed the value to 0 so you couldnt right click and change....) I could take spysheriff No.1 away but the second was shit so 11 Gb of music disappeared with the reinstalltion of windows :(
,Jonny_ekholm,2006-04-29T08:30Z,"(Continue from the 1st message)
... The link to spysheriff. But once i could get ( I had another easier spysheriff ) on the internet and i searched in forums and there was how to get to regedit"

,TorrentMail,2006-05-04T13:31Z,"DO NOT DOWNLOAD!! I have just downloaded, and all i got was the 2005 for win 98 and millenium!! This is a load of BS!!!!

Today is 04/05/06"
,Lucke__,2006-05-06T19:43Z,Is this updating all the time??
,ZoReX(zRx),2006-05-14T12:51Z,"Register norton this way:

1. Go to phone register.
2. Disconnect internet. (norton must NOT conenct to symantec server)
Put in 0's and in the last 3 spaces write 999.
You get it in 2457 days or about that.


About that you got an old norton i cant help with. Your torrent app must be pretty sick and/or ill............ Get bitcomet www.bitcomet.com



Hope you enjoy!

BUT!

If you actively use your internet for gaming and so on DO NOT USE THIS!
It takes so much RAM and internet speed that you will lag to hell !!"

,Jedi_Robin,2006-06-24T06:20Z,"Fuck most of you are dumb, a security system like norton takes tabs on who buys or does not buy there product? Are you gonna be stupid enough to download it without a license whitout them realizing it. Its a simple code to do such thing. omg people are depending on hacker created cracks, lol. f you want proper security with proper updates, PAY FOR IT!. Norton knows if you are updating on an illeagal crack copy. If you want to be secure, you dont fuck around..."
