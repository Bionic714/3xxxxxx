,DocNorton,2006-04-10T22:59Z,"This is an awesome choon.  

80's rock with long hair, bad perms and a guitar off that is UNBELIVEABLE - I'd even say James Hetfeild and Slash better watch out with the quality of these guitar solos..."
,brainstew.,2006-04-10T23:43Z,"Hetfield mostly plays rythm guitar, Kirk Hammet on the other hand might wanna watch out. imo these guys pushes the bar for guitar solos higher, Yngve Malmsten by all means but theses guys are insane."

,Coraxar,2006-08-12T11:51Z,"The two guitarplayers in DragonForce, especially Herman Li, are probably amongst the best guitarplayers in the world!
They play faster and more varied than any other i have ever seen. Yngwie, Petrucci and Satriani, you NEVER played as fast or hard as these two guys!"
,stevemorris,2008-01-01T19:37Z,WOW!!! Really impressive guitar players! Thanks brainstew for the video! Someone compared them to Hatfield and Slash...wrong! maybe COB...
