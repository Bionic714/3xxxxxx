,joburocks,2006-04-05T21:41Z,This is my absolute first torrent so let me know if I need to change anything.  Its great and helped me a lot.  ty
,4udi0wiz4rD,2006-04-05T23:04Z,"Please SEED !!!
Th4nx in advance   ;)"
,pronecobra,2006-04-30T21:34Z,"Say, I use Nuendo 2 -- do you think this tutorial would still be useful for me?   "
,joburocks,2006-05-04T05:24Z,"Yes it would, it covers alot of the new stuff but it also shows you some core features you may not know about in Nuendo 2.  Like auto punching in and out, recording styles, working with midi, editing and that kind of stuff. 

From watching it I found a whole new way to record music in more of a loop style.  If your using Nuendo in any version this will only add to your skill set.   Enjoy!"
,mweed4,2006-06-25T08:03Z,"hey does anyone have a copy of the  nuendo 3 dvd iso or disk? i have a bad copy of the original, use ver2.1 all the time 3.0 keeps dying "
,joburocks,2006-07-02T21:44Z,"there was one on here not sure what happened to it.  should be pretty readily available on other site though.  It was fixed by Team H20.  Good luck

Guess I better start seeding this again :)"

In response to torrent info... read a tutorial on the web.  Just download azureus to handle your torrents and do some research.  Things are never free in life.  In order to watch this you gotta put the time in to figure out how torrents work.  No one in this community is going to take you by the hand and show you.  Good luck."
,joburocks,2006-11-28T09:18Z,"keep this thing alive, i dont have it on my list of seeds anylonger.  Its all up to you!@@"

nonsense i dont mind taking the time to at least point the way [without my guidance being masked by aggressive critism as yours may have been]


quoting sivakumar_am:

""what is torrent""


you can think of a torrent kind of like a tag of a file, one that gets you to other people with the same file or parts of the same file [through the bitTorrent client you are using]

download vuze made by azureus.  it seems to have the friendliest interface for starters.  


i hope that was helpful



p.s.  thanks for this torrent joburocks :P
