btw
i have the original GOTY cd & i updated to utxp3 & network gaming doesn't work neither
When i start gameranger ĂŠ go to UT servers there are none online neither , maybe this is the reason ?"
,Scozzers,2006-04-12T03:00Z,"Albertii - Gameranger doesn't return UT servers because Epic cut the link for some reason. Gameranger would return the same servers that you find in game anyway.
If it's the full UT then it will work online with the osx update - hosting and joining."

,isaacn86,2008-02-02T17:53Z,"I would like to say thanks for the Game. 

Since no one else is helping to install this game, i will be the nice guy.
I have OS X leopard

1. Mount the .dmg file you just downloaded.

2. go to http://www.veloffdesigns.com/utmac/upgrade-ut.asp#combined

3. download 436_and_4BonusBack_Files.sit (59.3 MB)

4. Download Stuffit Xpander (if you don't already have it)

5. Use Stuffit to open the .SIT file you just downloaded from www.veloffdesigns.com

6. Copy all files from the ""Unreal Tournament Full OSX.dmg"" to a new folder in Applications.

7. Open the ""436_and_4BonusBack_Files"" folder. There you will see the UT icon, 2 .ini files, and a .log file. Copy and paste those to the  folder you made in Applications. It should ask to replace, make sure you replace all.

8. Open the ""436_and_4BonusBack_Files"" folder. There you will see System, Textures, Map, and Help folders. Open each one, copy the files to the same folder in the one you made in applications. (IE: copy from ""System"" folder, put into ""system"" folder, replace all.) 

9. After this you should be able to play. Online doesn't work for me, so if someone figures it out, please share your  knowledge.

Any questions, just ask, i might be able to help.

AS FOR PEOPLE WHO DID FIGURE IT OUT AND DID NOT HELP US. FUCK YOU!!!! IF YOU FIGURED IT OUT, DON'T JUST LEAVE A COMMENT SAYING ""WORKS GOOD, THANKS"". HELP THE REST OF US WHO ARE HAVING TROUBLE. THOSE ARE PROBABLY THE PRICKS WHO JUST DOWNLOAD AND UPLOAD SHIT. I UPLOADED THIS GAME LOTS, AND I STILL AM. I HATE THOSE DICKS. 

Well everyone I hope I was able to help, Plz SEED."
,huzza81,2008-02-24T00:27Z,"Online:

The problem is that the netcode is no good in the UT preview 3 (the UT 99 OSX app, remember it is still a Beta).

So when you choose online in UT99, it looks like everything freezes. But it does`nt. What ever you do, do NOT touch any buttons (inc. Keyboard/Mouse). Within 10 minutes you should see the game unfreezes and the server list updating it self.

Enjoy your self:)



It is a shame that Epic never ported UT99 to OSX or at least released to engine as open source.

,ViDER,2008-03-21T07:12Z,"I managed to run it, but I still have no internet games :/.

What I did:

3) Creat a folder for ""games"" then inside it 
    create a folder ""UT"", make it in your HD.
4) Copy all the files from the dmg mounted file 
    into the UT folder.
5) Download the file from here:

6) Unpack it into your UT folder and overwrite all the 3 files.

4. Download text"
,azza9188,2008-03-29T12:43Z,"sorry....continued...

4. Download Tex-Edit Plus from here http://www.pure-mac.com/textword.html if you havn't already got it.

5. Right-Click the UnrealTournament.ini file (In the folder where you copied everything to) and Open with Tex-Edit.

6. Scroll down the document only a little bit and you should see:
FullscreenViewportX=1280
FullscreenViewportY=1024 

or something similar (It is under [MacDrv.MacClient]). Now change these both to the following:
FullscreenViewportX=1024
FullscreenViewportY=768

7. Save it, and launch Unreal Tournament.

Voila, and there you have a perfectly working Unreal Tournament for Mac OSX.
I tried everything and this is what worked for me."

You will not be able to get online initially. Many have been noting of this. I found a way to get online. I have found it is still somewhat buggy. The problem I have is that if I start a practice session, I cannot connect to a server. It seems to me you can only connect if you just open the game and go to connect. Here's what worked for me:

http://att.macrumors.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=109264&d=1206418339
If this link does not work, go to:

Half way down the page, socamx attaches his file.
Follow the directions in the zip. You will need to place a file in the system folder, and edit maybe 8 lines in your INI file. Copy and paste jobs.

Viola!

Now if only I could fix the smoke trail bug, this would be flawless. But I am however extremely pleased to be playing this game online =) It's been a long time and I have always missed the online action of this game. I find most straight deathmatch to be rather boring these days, but this one just rocks on the right levels for me.

,diarrhea_jones,2010-05-01T07:25Z,"Thanks for the bare-bones torrent, dicktree. No music, resolution is a bitch to fix, sound FX are fuzzy, it crashes periodically (but the game auto-saves beforehand) and there is no multiplayer.

I mean I guess you CAN play the game all the way through but you certainly don't get the full experience.

FOR PEOPLE EXPERIENCING THE DRAWSPROCKET PROBLEM

1) Basic installation: FIRST, go into your Applications folder inside your hard drive and create a folder called ""Unreal Tournament"".

2) Open the Unreal DMG that you downloaded from here and copy EVERYTHING inside the DMG into the ""Unreal Tournament"" file that you created in your Applications folder.

3) Go to this link http://www.pure-mac.com/textword.html and download the program called ""Tex-Edit Plus"" (under word processors). We will need this to change file within the DMG because Apple's Text Edit cannot do it, I assure you it's completely safe and completely necessary.

4) Once ""Tex-Edit Plus) is downloaded, open it, and use it to open a file called ""UnrealTournament.ini"" found in the ""Unreal Tournament"" file that you created. Once it's opened, hit ""Apple+F"" on your keyboard to bring up the ""Find"" option and search for ""Fullscreen"", it should bring back a pair of words within the .ini file, one on top of the other, that say ""FullscreenViewportX=1280 and FullscreenViewportY=1024"". You need to change the top number (the X one) to 1024 and the bottom number (the Y one) to 768. Once this is done, close ""Tex-Edit Plus"" and save the ini document. This is what ""Tex-Edit Plus"" is good for, because Apple's ""Text Edit"" cannot save the .ini file for whatever reason.

5) Double-click the Unreal Tournament icon in the ""Unreal Tournament"" folder within the Applications folder and launch the game, and enjoy!"
