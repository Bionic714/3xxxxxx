,Sokz,2006-05-14T14:21Z,"Both of the cracks dosen't work? Could someone kindly tell me how to make this crack to work? I replaced the crack with the original Tiger Woods PGA 2005 icon. When I launch the game, the icon bounces for a while and then shut unexpectidly??

Thankz!"

I am a neophyte

Could someone kindly tell me how to install this crack ?

Thanks"
,limeyluke,2006-08-25T01:21Z,"1. Open the main Tiger disk image
2. Drag and drop ""Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2005"" onto your hard disk to copy it (wherever you like)
3. Open up the crack of your choice.
4. Drag and drop the Tiger Woods icon into the file that you just copied onto your drive. When it asks if you want to replace it, say ""Yes, please, i'd love to play some golf""
5. Double-click and Play!"
