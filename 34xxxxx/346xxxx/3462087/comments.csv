You should read up on the apps you're using. 

Nuker Xt has been known to be classified as spyware. A risk I'm willing to take, seems how my antivirus or other spyware apps can recognize this issue, and that Nuker Xt can see things most other spyware cleaners do not. 

Also, the reason your antivirus detects as you run Nuker Xt is because in order to sweep it interacts with the files of your computer, thus, it will trigger a trojan or what have you and bam, you antivirus then recognizes the activity.

So, the antivirus and spyware cleaner effectively work together to clean a threat."
