    Game Notes:
    ~~~~~~~~~~~
    Juiced is a racing simulation that totally immerses players in the 
    lifestyle, community and risk-taking of the real-life street modding
    scene in a unique and compelling way. Juiced doesn't pay lip-service to 
    the modding scene, it takes players there and immerses them in the 
    culture - racing for pink slips, creating crews and providing the 
    complete freedom to customize cars - from the dashboard to the 
    drivetrain. Featuring over 50 licensed cars, 200 official aftermarket 
    parts, and incredible online head-to-head play for up to 6 players and 
    team-based racing; Juiced is one of this year's most anticipated racing 
    titles.
    
    Ripped:

    Release Note:
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    What?s this? MYTH has PROPERED it's own rip? What madness.
    Yes that's correct! We have indeed PROPERED ourselves.

    Why?
    In the interests of maintaining rip scene standards we chose to proper
    ourselves and keep the rips nice and small as they should be.

    Many times groups past, present and for sure in the future have cried
    fowl when MYTH has propered them. Well now they no longer have a case
    that we are picking on them. As of today we have PROVEN that we are
    dedicated to making the best rips possible for the end users. No
    matter who we make look lame for our dedication to quality rips.

    Also in the past many have said the RIP scene is dead, due to the
    craving for iSO. Well while some users can experience 1GB links in
    the home, they are still shackled by traffic byte limits. Therefore
    no matter how fast the link is, if it has traffic limits you could
    use all your metered traffic up with one DVD9 release!

    Thus the future of rip is in limiting how much traffic you incur,
    whilst still maintaining the quality of the warez you wish to obtain.
    Here on the GAME RIP scene, is where MYTH comes in of course!

    Recently we have seen the advent of DVD and DVD9 formats. And MYTH
    has ripped games from these formats, as is to be expected. With
    removable storage media becoming so cheap you can carry your MYTH
    rips with you on your keychain these days! This is another advantage
    of using quality rips and there are many more, such as faster load
    times and so on.

    Thus RIP is not dead and never will be. Expect MYTH to rip 20GB DVD's
    down in the future and beyond.

    So, while we have RETIRED of the lesson dealings to the CLASS, we
    shall always make sure that MYTH brings you the latest and best GAME
    RIPS in the scene by keeping the rip scene alive along with all the
    other elites.

    Signed: MYTH



    Read this NFO properly!
