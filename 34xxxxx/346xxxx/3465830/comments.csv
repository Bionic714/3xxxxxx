But what is compression ... XviD or DivX
Could you give some more INFO about the AVI-files.

thanx (Carrey is the greatest, though Fun With Dick And Jane was a bit dissapointing)"
,ahoxan,2006-04-04T00:59Z,Sorry about the paucity of information.  I downloaded these files separately last year when I was still a rank tyro about video codecs and wasn't paying attention.  I'll pay more attention in the future and also get some tools to extract those types of information on the video files that I do have.
