,hanskim,2006-04-03T14:21Z,how i can burn thhose rar files?
,shadowny,2006-04-03T14:35Z,"Unrar all files. If it's an .IMG or .ISO use DVDDecrypter to burn. If it's a bunch of .VOB and .IFO .BUP files, use nero to make a new dvd, then drag all files to video_ts folder.

HTH"

,Drunken Fella,2006-04-06T22:41Z,@ qbertman; it is probarbly because your harddrive is FAT formatted. FAT formatted harddrives cannot handle files larger than 4 GB. You'll need to unpack it on a NTFS formatted harddrive.

,roherin,2006-04-19T12:34Z,"Nej nej nej igen. Varför slarvas det med ljudet. En så maffig film som King kong förtjänar att behålla sitt surround-ljud. 5.1 är det inte bara så att ni vet. Inte heller fler subs än tre varianter av svenska (inghen katastrof för mig iofs) Denna torrent är i 2 kanals stereo bara så att ni vet. 

Kan man inte börja sortera alla torrents efter ljudkvalitet (DTS. Dolby Digital eller 2ch) Jag vill inte ha DVDripar utan BRA ljud."
,roherin,2006-04-19T12:47Z,Är inte detta en TC? Kan omöjligt vara en DVD-rip med så dålig scanning.

,eternalquestion,2006-04-27T13:35Z,"RE: FAT32.  You should buy the external hard drive, transfer all your files there, and redo your existing hard drive with the NTFS format.

RE: Download speeds.  How do you get your speeds above 300kb/s?  I have a cable connection in Toronto, Canada.  Is it about choosing the right port or what?"
,jb16,2006-04-29T22:18Z,"Help. I converted everything OK, I thought, but after 35 min. (chapter 18) the movie ""hangs"". No possiblility to go to the next chapters.
