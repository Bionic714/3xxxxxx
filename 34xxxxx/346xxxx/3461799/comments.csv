,witney,2006-04-06T20:42Z,"I am gonna get round to it - I do qualify as an upload noob. So much so, that I do not know how it works - I tried the various failsafe methods but thay aren't in plain english. 

The files within the folder all disintegrated to 0 bytes when I tried. Sorry!  

Feel free to tell me the plain-english method of seeding process (I use the most basic BitTorrent 4.4.1)."

You will have to ""download"" your own torrent to the location where the files are. It will then verify that the files are complete and you will switch to seeding.

Good luck!"
