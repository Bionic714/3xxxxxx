     After a host of disappointing solo albums and
     quickly diminishing celebrity (most of the latter
     devoted to the continuing extra-legal saga of Ol' Dirty
     Bastard), Wu-Tang Clan returned, very quietly, with
     2000's The W.The lack of hype was fitting, for this is
     a very spartan work, especially compared to its
     predecessor,the sprawling and overblown Wu-Tang
     Forever. While the trademark sound is still much in
     force, group mastermind RZA jettisoned the elaborate
     beat symphonies and carefully placed strings of Forever
     in favor of tight productions with little more than
     scarred soul samples and tight, tough beats. The back-
     to-basics approach works well, not only because it
     rightly puts the focus back on the best cadre of
     rappers in the world of hip-hop, but also because RZA's
     immense trackmaster talents can't help but shine
     through anyway.
