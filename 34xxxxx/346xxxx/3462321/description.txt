[b]Review:[/b]

if you are a fan of brandon dicamillo then this CD is as RAW as it gets. and when i say raw, i mean really raw. the reason i only gave this 8 stars instead of 10 is because its obvious that bam and dicamillo recorded this with a bad quality tape recorder with a bad quality tape. the production is defintiely bad. what is great about this however, is that you get brandon and his freestyle's in its truest form. my favorites are he-man on the loose, nigery rap from the south, and the new chinese freestyle. get it if you want to hear pure brandon in the basement for the 1st time. but be prepared for the not so great "boom-box" sound quality.
