,Wopatoolie,2009-01-30T04:15Z,"dont bother with this mess the poster puts here in the three stooges. he says there are over 200 stooges shorts; anyone who knows the stooges knows there were only about 185-89 made, not including movies. i like TPB best but these stooges posts r crap. get the entire stooges collection, long lost including movies and the Mel Gibson movie at:
