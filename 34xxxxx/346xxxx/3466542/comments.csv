,AsUkA_LP,2006-04-08T00:33Z,.....
,Slapp85,2006-04-08T15:23Z,Can anybody tell me how i can play this bin cue files.... vlc cant take them
,CHEMICALLYstupid,2006-04-08T18:45Z,"To play a bin/cue file goto www.daemon-tools.cc and get the Daemon Tools program (free) Then when you run the program in the task bar right click the daemon tools icon (red lightning bolt) - goto virtual cd rom drive - mount device - then just browse to your cue file. Then it will open like you just put a CD in. All Bin/Cue's are, are images of a CD. Nero has the same capability but I find daemon tools much easier to use. 

Now... does anyone know the quality of this?"
,zaltan,2006-04-09T01:15Z,"Why can't people just read the guides that are on this site. Every time you look through the comments to see if anyone has something to say about the quality, there's always someone asking how to play the movie. C'mon ppl, I know were not all geniuses, but PLZ READ THE GUIDES!!!"

,straatMan_,2006-04-10T12:58Z,Seems like noone will answer. I download this file and answer your questions. These morons really donät know how to answer. 
,ctrlaltde1337,2006-04-10T23:13Z,People with bitching questions about the quality of movies; download the SAMPLE file from the SAMPLE folder of the torrent... then decide for yourself whether it's worth downloading or not. Peace.
,jabbaru,2006-04-11T07:43Z,how do you download just the sample ? .. when looking at the 122 files they are not highlighted for download just a long list of file names. Any advice would be good.

,subweiler,2006-04-30T10:47Z,"TS = Telesync = from a cinema = not the best quality. But thanks to uploader, there are no available DVD-quality copys of this one yet. See it now in so-so quality and enjoy or wait for the DVD and enjoy later...Your choice."
