,Tr1ckY,2006-10-17T11:49Z,"""i have downloaded completly...but there's no images...how to install..please inform me..the files are in bin format how to install""

You can create *.cue files, and mount them instead."
,Tr1ckY,2006-10-17T11:57Z,"oops, i forgot to write how to create them :/
here goes:

FILE ""rld-nu2a.bin"" BINARY
  TRACK 01 MODE1/2352
    INDEX 01 00:00:00

and save that as rld-nu2a.cue in the same directory as the other files. write in notebook (i dont really know what it is in english).
With CD2 you do the same. but write 'rld-nu2b' instead.

Enjoy! :)"
,Tr1ckY,2006-10-17T12:03Z,"just found out, its Notepad instead of Notebook... :P 
but it works fine, im installing now with the *.cue files mounted in daemon tools"
