,no_nick,2006-04-18T02:44Z,Episode 2 is fucked up. Your better of downloading it through a diffrent torrent.
,asage,2006-04-19T18:49Z,"Fantastic, it is not just episode 2 fucked up, e10 is also pissing me off. Fffffuck!
Really, if you are going to do something, do it right.
But thank you anyway, great, collection of season 1, 2 fucked up episodes and e15 missing =). I DO recommend this to anyone who wants to get some excitement in their lives =). Good riddings to bad rubbish.."

,Gurukai,2006-12-07T05:05Z,none of the episodes r messed up for me... download and use VLC player. it is one of the best video (any format) players out there. works great for anything. plays files that windows media player wont play and BS player sux compared to it.
