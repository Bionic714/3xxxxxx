"The film chronicles the latest in the thinking and activism of the noted linguist Noam Chomsky, who since the Vietnam War era has been a vocal and consistent critic of the way the United States exercises state power in the world arena. A collaboration between the independent Japanese production house Siglo and American film director John Junkerman, ?Power and Terror? is in worldwide distribution, beginning with theatrical release in Japan, the United States, and Australia.

The film premiered in Tokyo on September 11, 2002 on the first anniversary of the 9.11 terrorist attacks on New York and Washington."

I hope this movie can work as a introduction to Noam Chomsky for some people. The ones of you who is already familiar with his works this will be nothing new.
With subtitles (though not perfect translation) and menus.
