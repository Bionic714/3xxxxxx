Well, when I'm not seeding that is usaully because I'm asleep.

And the movie is pretty lousy made, you get the impression that the moviemakers are trying to build some kind of cult around Chomsky. But if you can ignore that, Chomsky is great as always =)"
,Mr_Ecks,2006-04-02T18:33Z,Makaronipudding>> Well I guess You are entiteled to sleep once in a while. I couldn't get the audio and subs to play in m-player classic or the computer dvd-player... never encountered the mds/mdf format before. After renaming it to iso(as usual) it worked like a charm. Thanks!
,Makaronipudding,2006-04-02T20:29Z,I use Alcohol 120% to read the .mds and then play it with VLC.
,xcarobx,2006-04-04T23:18Z,"If you´re using Mac OS X, rename the .mdf file so that it ends with .dmg and use use Toast 7 to mount or burn."
