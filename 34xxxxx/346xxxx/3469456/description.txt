The following items were added after the game manual went to print:

DESCENT and OS/2
????????????????
To get Descent to run under OS/2, just increase your DPMI_MEMORY_LIMIT
to 8 megs or more.  Descent should then run perfectly with full sound.
If your joystick behaves strangely under OS/2 try using the "-JoyPolled"
command line option.  Keep in mind that Descent does not officially
support OS/2.


DESCENT and Windows
???????????????????
Use the following settings in your PIF file:

   Optional Parameters:  -JoyPolled
            EMS Memory:  KB Limit -1
            XMS Memory:  KB Limit -1
         Display Usage:  Full Screen
             Execution:  Exclusive

If you use a joystick, the -JoyPolled option uses an alternate method of
joystick reading that should increase performance under Windows.
Keep in mind that Descent does not officially support Windows.


DESCENT and INTERNET HEAD-TO-HEAD DEMON (IHHD)
??????????????????????????????????????????????
While playing Multiplayer Descent through the IHHD software is possible,
it is not recommended.  The delay in packet delivery will almost
certainly lead to strange results.  You may see players jump around
suddenly, or even disappear for several seconds at a time.  You may also
witness players not dropping powerups when killed, staying cloaked too
long, or other unfavorable results.


COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
????????????????????
The following command-line options were not mentioned in the manual:

  -RInvul <n>    New multiplayer option.  Keeps the Main Reactor
                 invulnerable until n minutes have passed where n is a
                 value between 1-314.

  -AutoDemo      Continuously cycles through all DEM files in directory.

  -NoMusic       Disables music; sound effects remain enabled.

  -JoyPolled     Reads joystick using the standard IBM PC polling method,
                 instead of using the 1.19Mhz system timer.  This is useful
                 for multitasking operating systems, like OS/2 and Windows,
                 which support the polling method.

  -JoyBios       Reads joystick using BIOS function 15h.  This will
                 improve the joystick readings under certain operating
                 systems and configurations.  This is not normally
                 recommended for DOS users.
 
  -Iglasses      Enables support for Virtual I-O's I-glasses! stereo-
                 scopic rendering.

  -VioTrack <n>  Enables Virtual I-O I-glasses! head tracking on serial
                 port <n>.

  -3dMaxLo       Enables support for the 3D-Max shutter glass system in
                 320x200 interlaced mode.  3dbios must be installed!

  -3dMaxHi       Enables support for the 3D-Max shutter glass system in
                 320x400 interlaced mode.  3dbios must be installed!

SCREENSHOT VIEWER

                       ? 3. TIPS for NEW PILOTS ?
                       »ÕÕÕÕÕÕÕÕÕÕÕÕÕÕÕÕÕÕÕÕÕÕÕÕº

In addition to the following tips, your Descent box includes a "walkthrough"
for level 1.  It explains in detail how to maneuver your way through level
1 and explains the basics of gameplay.

Here are a few things that help new players adjust to the fully 3D world
and intelligent robots of Descent.  Heed these tips and you'll soon be
blasting robot hordes (and your friends!) with ease.

     o Use a quality joystick.  Thrustmaster, Advanced Gravis, and
       CH Products provide full lines of controls well suited to 3D
       flying.

     o If you use a two-button joystick, try keeping one hand on the
       A and Z keys to control your FORWARD and REVERSE.

     o If you're up against a wall, try using REVERSE to back away 
       instead of turning around.

     o Learn how to SLIDE well.  Using vertical sliding instead of pitching
       will help keep you upright.  If your joystick has a Hat Switch, 
       use it to slide.

     o Use SLIDE to evade enemy fire.  This will help keep the robots
       in your sights.

     o Sweep fire side-to-side to hit evading robots.  This is especially
       important on higher skill levels where robots evade faster.  Also
       try using lasers and missiles simultaneouslly against an evading
       robot.

     o Rescue the hostages!  If you rescue all hostages in a mine, you
       receive a full rescue bonus.  But be sure you make it out after
       picking them up - if your ship's destroyed, so are they.

     o Try clearing a path to the exit before you attack the Main Reactor.
       You may run out of time if you're battling hordes of robots on
       your escape!

     o The blast radius of a concussion missile is very effective 
       against tight groups of robots.  

     o Look for secret doors.  Weapons and ammo are often behind them.                      
       They can be a different color, or have small seams running down
       them.  Keep in mind, Descent is fully 3D, and secret doors aren't
       only in the walls...

     o DON'T SIT STILL.  The best way to stay alive is to keep moving.
       Using SLIDE to circle a target while you're firing is very
       effective.

     o Learn to use your ship's Automap.  It can reveal things your
       eyes may miss.

     o Flares can help sniff out cloaked robots & players.

Thrustmaster, Gravis Phoenix, and Logitech Cyberman controls are fully
supported by Descent.  The device control files (DESCENT2.ADV, DESCENT.B50,
DESCENT.M50, and DESCENT.PHX) can be found in your Descent directory.
If you have a Wingman Extreme, you should use the Thrustmaster FCS option.

       Thrustmaster FCS:  Choose "Thrustmaster FCS" under Options/Controls.
         or Logitech      This is for players _not_ also using the WCS.
        Wingman Extreme   If you use the WCS throttle with the FCS, follow
                          instructions for the WCS below.

     * Thrustmaster WCS:  Load the DESCENT2.ADV file into your WCS.  In
           Mark II        Descent, choose "Joystick" under Options/Controls.
                          Now choose "Configure Above" and change the
                          THROTTLE entry to respond to the WCS (the Y2 axis).

    * Thrustmaster FLCS:  Load the DESCENT.B50 & .M50 files into your FLCS. 
                          If you also use a WCS throttle, no program should
                          be loaded into the WCS.

         Gravis Phoenix:  Load the DESCENT.PHX file into your Phoenix. In
                          Descent, choose "Joystick" under Options/Controls.
                          Now choose "Configure Above" and change the
                          THROTTLE entry to respond to the throttle
                          slider (the Y2 axis).

      Logitech Cyberman:  You must have the Cyberman MOUSE.COM driver loaded
                          before you run Descent.  If you have a standard
                          mouse connected as well, you will need to use the
                          "/dual" option when you load MOUSE.COM.  See
                          Cyberman docs for details.  

Calibration Note:  When using one of the analog throttles listed here or
                   the CH Flightstick, you will be prompted to calibrate
                   your throttle as well as your joystick.

*  >> NOTE TO WCS and FLCS USERS:  Because these devices intercept the
      keyboard signals, your ship may fly strangely when you also hold down
      keyboard keys (like 'A' and 'Z').  If you keep the WCS or FLCS on
      your system, it's recommended that you use those devices for throttle
      control and sliding, not the keyboard.

Regardless of configuration, you should have no trouble running Descent.
But in the unlikely case you do have problems, here are some helpful
pointers:
      
General Problems
????????????????
=> Q:  I HAVE LESS THAN 10MB OF RAM, AND I'M LOW ON DISK SPACE.  DESCENT
       HANGS/CRASHES ON ME.  WHAT CAN I DO?

   A:  If Descent doesn't have enough free RAM available, it uses hard
       drive space instead of RAM.  If this is the case, make sure you
       have plenty of free disk space (at least 8-16MB free).

=> Q:  DESCENT RUNS SLOWLY ON MY MACHINE, ESPECIALLY IN LARGE BATTLES.
       WHAT CAN I DO?

   A:  Try putting your detail level on a lower setting.  Also try using
       F3 and +/- to change the size of the game window.  Lowering the
       number of available sound channels in Options/Detail/Custom
       menu can help significantly in large battles.

=> Q:  I HAVE A SMALL GAME WINDOW AND A LOW DETAIL LEVEL, BUT DESCENT STILL
       LOADS AND RUNS SLOWLY.

   A:  Check your sound card settings in SETUP.  Incorrect settings
       can cause significant slowdown.

=> Q:  THE WALLS IN MY GAME SEEM TO JUMP AROUND IN THE DISTANCE.  WHY?
=> Q:  I GET A COLORED WALL IN THE MIDDLE OF MY TUNNELS.  WHAT IS THIS?

   A:  These are due to the Detail Level being set below the highest
       setting.  Consult your Descent Manual.  

=> Q:  MY COMPUTER HAS 4 MEGS OF RAM.  THE GAME IS SLOW AND ACCESSES THE
       HARD DRIVE ALL THE TIME.

   A:  If you have less than 8 megs of RAM, try running a disk cache (even
       as small as 256k).  This can help immensely.  Also try using the
       "-lowmem" command line option when running Descent.  You might
       consider purchasing a memory upgrade.  Every meg of RAM you add will
       increase performance.

=> Q:  DESCENT LOCKS UP WHEN I RUN IT.

   A:  Try running Descent with the "-nosound" option.  If this works, then
       chances are it's a sound card problem.  Run SETUP and make sure
       your card settings are correct.  If you don't hear digital sounds or
       music when you test them in SETUP, try Autodetection.  If this
       doesn't help, refer to your sound card manual for troubleshooting
       instructions, or call Interplay Technical Support.    

=> Q:  MY COMPUTER LOCKS UP WHEN AUTODETECTING SOUND CARDS IN SETUP.
       WHAT'S WRONG?

   A:  Due to hardware conflicts, autodetecting for sound cards is a
       risky process.  If you know the brand, port address, IRQ, and
       DMA of your sound card(s), it is recommended that you manually
       configure these items.  Lockups are also common when autodetection
       is used when no sound cards are installed.

=> Q:  I CAN'T SELECT THE RIGHT PORT/IRQ/DMA FOR MY SOUNDCARD IN SETUP.

   A:  If the proper selections don't appear in the SETUP, then you can
       always select them manually by editing your DESCENT.CFG file
       located in your DESCENT directory.  While we tried to account for
       every possibility, some of the more exotic configurations may not
       be listed.  Contact Interplay if your setup is not listed.  

=> Q:  WHY DON'T I HEAR ANYTHING WHEN I TEST MY SOUND IN SETUP?

   A:  You may have the wrong sound card selected, or incorrect port,
       IRQ or DMA settings.  Volume may be set too low in your sound
       drivers (or the volume slider on the back of your sound card).
       Hardware conflicts or loose cables may be to blame as well.
      
=> Q:  MY JOYSTICK ISN'T RESPONDING IN THE GAME.  WHAT'S WRONG?

   A:  Be sure you have JOYSTICK selected in the Options/Controls menu,
       and that it's calibrated.  If your joystick connects to your
       soundcard, make sure the joystick port jumper is ENABLED on the card.
       Some soundcards have this disabled by default.

=> Q:  HEY!  SOME OF MY POWERUPS DISAPPEARED.  WHAT HAPPENED?

       Certain powerups will remove themselves from the game if they have
       been around 4 or 5 minutes.  This only happens to Concussion
       Missiles, Energy, and Shield powerups dropped by a dead player.
    
=> Q:  WHY DOES DESCENT ACT STRANGELY WHEN I RUN IT UNDER WINDOWS?

   A:  While Descent may run under Windows, it isn't recommended.  You will
       probably get odd behavior and slowdowns due to timer conflicts.
       GUS users may get no sound at all under Windows.  If you are having
       joystick problems, try using the -JoyPolled command line option.

=> Q:  I HAVE A THRUSTMASTER WCS HOOKED UP WITH A JOYSTICK.  WHEN I USE
       THE STICK TO FLY, AND THE 'A' AND 'Z' KEYS TO MOVE FORWARD AND
       BACK, I START FLYING OUT OF CONTROL.  WHY?

       Holding down keyboard keys will produce erratic results when the
       WCS or FLCS controls are installed.  See note in Section 4 for
       details.

=> Q:  WHY ISN'T MY MIDDLE MOUSE BUTTON WORKING IN DESCENT?

   A:  While Descent supports three-button mice, you still need to load
       a mouse driver that supports three buttons.  Typically Microsoft
       mouse drivers support two and Logitech drivers use three.

=> Q:  I HAVE A GATEWAY 2000 P75.  THE COLORS IN DESCENT ARE COMPLETELY
       MESSED UP.  WHAT CAN I DO?

   A:  Do a hard reboot of your computer and enter the BIOS setup.
       Find the "VGA Palette Snoop" option and disable it.  This should
       fix the problem.

=> Q:  DESCENT LOCKS UP AT THE TITLE SCREEN.

   A:  Turn off the "Hidden Refresh" option in your BIOS Advanced settings.
       Also make sure RAMBIOS.SYS does _not_ appear in your CONFIG.SYS
       and that "Hardware Video Shadowing" is turned off in BIOS.


Modem/Serial Problems
?????????????????????
=> Q:  WHEN PLAYING A MODEM/SERIAL GAME, MY GAME FREEZES ON THE "WAITING
       FOR OPPONENT" SCREEN.  WHAT GIVES?

   A:  This screen will appear if you have died in/escaped from an
       exploding mine.  If the other player is still flying there can be
       up to a 60 second delay.  This is normal.  However, if your game
       sits at this screen much longer, chances are something is wrong.
       Likely culprits:  opponent is having technical difficulties,
       interference with unshielded serial cables, loose cables,
       baud rate set too high, or uncorrected errors in the modem
       transmission.

=> Q:  MY MODEM GAMES ARE MUCH SLOWER THAN NORMAL ONE-PLAYER GAMES.

   A:  Try using a higher baud rate in the Com Settings menu.  If your
       computer does not have a 16550 UART, acquiring one will allow
       up to 38400 baud when communicating with the modem.  Consult your
       Descent Manual for details.

=> Q:  STRANGE THINGS HAPPEN IN MY MODEM/NULL-MODEM GAMES.  WHAT CAN
       I DO TO HELP THIS?

   A:  This may be a result of dropped serial characters.  Some examples
       of "strange" things:  players not dropping powerups when killed,
       ships jumping from place to place on screen, or ships flying
       through doors that appear closed.  If you get error messages during
       play or during the "waiting for opponent" screen, this could be
       the cause as well.

       These problems may occur for several reasons.  Serial play adds an
       additional burden to the CPU when playing the game, so a computer
       capable of playing the game in single-player mode may have
       difficulties with modem or serial play.  If you are using a
       4-megabyte machine, the disk activity needed to run the program in
       a small memory space can cause lost characters.  A lot of sound
       activity can also cause lost serial characters.  Increasing the RAM
       for the game or reducing the number of sound channels in the detail
       settings menu can sometimes help.  Of course you can also reduce
       the baud rate in the Com Settings menu to slow down the game
       somewhat while improving reliability.  Also try setting your music
       volume slider to 0 in the Options menu.

       The best thing you can do to improve serial performance is to equip
       your machine with a 16550 UART.  However, even with this UART 38.4k
       baud rate can still be problematic if you have the burden of low
       RAM or heavy sound activity, so don't be ashamed to run a 16550
       UART at 19.2k baud if need be.


Netgame Problems
????????????????

=> Q:  I HAVE A ZEOS PANTERA P60 WITH A SOUNDCARD AND WHEN I TRY PLAYING
       A NETGAME IT LOCKS UP.  WHAT CAN I DO?

   A:  Instead of doing a full login to your server, try loading only the
       IPX drivers.  Descent Netgames only require this to function
       properly.

=> Q:  I'M GETTING AN ERROR SAYING MY IPX DRIVERS AREN'T LOADED PROPERLY.
       WHAT DO I DO?

   A:  First, make sure you have a reasonable amount of low memory
       available.  Although Descent uses a DOS extender to avoid low-
       memory hassles, some low memory is still needed for network buffers.
       If this fails, make sure your IPX.COM and other network drivers
       are loaded properly.  A good way to test this is to logon to
       a network server, if one is available.

=> Q:  MY NETGAMES SEEM SLOW AND UNRELIABLE.  WHAT'S UP WITH THAT?

   A:  Try using a different socket number.  It's possible that some other
       application on your computer uses socket 5100h and this is
       preventing Descent from opening a proper network connection.  Try
       large values for the -socket option (like 32 or 100).  Remember,
       your opponents will need to use the same socket you do.

=> Q:  DESCENT TELLS ME MY NETWORK CARD IS MISSING PACKETS.  WHAT THE
       HECK DOES THAT MEAN?

   A:  This can be a result of a slow network card, heavy traffic on the
       network, or software conflicts in your system.  If you get this
       message, you can rejoin the game and try again.  If the problem
       persists, one of the following could be to blame:

       - Loose cables.  Happens to the best of us.  Check the plugs on
         the back of your computer, specifically the ones running to/from
         your network card.

       - Too many players.  While 8 players is offered as the maximum
         in Descent, it's possible that your LAN or computer configuration
         can only support 4-6 players reliably.

       - Bad network card.  Some cards drop IPX packets even without
         heavy loads or interference.  If you suspect your LAN card, try
         swapping it with one from another computer.

       - Software conflicts.  Other drivers may be running that cause
         problems with the network interrupts.  These conflicts may not
         emerge when performing other LAN tasks that either don't use
         IPX or have layers of error-checking.  Try removing unneeded
         drivers from your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT.

       - Router problems.  Playing Descent with players on different sides
         of a router may cause lost packets or delays.  Playing this way
         is not recommended because it creates a significant load on the
         router that may disturb other LAN users.

Can't get enough Descent?

In addition to Descent Registered/Commercial, a CD-Enhanced Descent will
be released in Summer 1995.  New features expected to be in the CD-Enhanced
version include MANY new levels (including Anarchy specific ones), new
powerups, new enemies, animated cutscenes, new multiplayer features, and
enhanced digital soundtrack and sound effects.

Exact pricing for Descent CD-Enhanced has not been determined yet, but
Registered owners will have an upgrade path for a minimal price.
