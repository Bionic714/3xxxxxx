,Pirate 32,2006-05-13T08:02Z,For most of his life Malcom X believed and taught that whites were devils.  He became a muslim in 1945.  He had even said that they were an experiment gone wrong by a black man.
,Pirate 32,2006-05-13T08:03Z,"Then when he went to Saudi Arabia in feb '63 to perform the hajj, he realized that there were also white muslims, and thus awakened to the fact that not all whites were bad.  Then in march '64 he was assasinated by some bastards.

Ok lets do some math here.  He was a muslim for 18 years while hating whites.  Then after he learns there are white muslims and good white people, he dies 1.5 years later.

Obviously he didnt know a whole lot about islam most of his life.  Wonder what else he would have learned about it if he wast shot."

,Pirate 32,2006-05-13T08:25Z,"perhaps he would have learned that before they took over most of africa that countries like egypt, libia, algeria, and other islamic-african countries were originally christian.  Perhaps he would also have learned that to become christian these places didnt require persuasion of the sword, unlike the muslims that followed them."
,Pirate 32,2006-05-13T08:26Z,"Perhaps he would also have learned that muhammad was white, and referred to black slaves in his area as ""ones whose head resembles a raisen."""
,Pirate 32,2006-05-13T08:27Z,Perhaps he would also have discovered WHY so much conquest was achieved in the name of ALLA.
,Pirate 32,2006-05-13T08:35Z,"perhaps some of the following passages would have given him a hint:

Ishaq:322 ?I will cast terror into the hearts of those who reject Me. So strike off their heads and cut off their fingers. All who oppose Me and My Prophet shall be punished severely.?

quran 008.012 ?Your Lord inspired the angels [fellow demons] with the message: ?I am with you. Go and give firmness to the Believers. I will terrorize the unbelievers. Therefore smite them on their necks and every joint and incapacitate them. Strike off their heads and cut off each of their fingers and toes.?

quran 008.039 ?So fight them until there is no more Fitnah (disbelief [non-Muslims]) and all submit to the religion of Allah alone (in the whole world). But if they cease, Allah is Seer of what they do.?"
,Pirate 32,2006-05-13T08:35Z,"Ishaq:324 ?He said, Fight them so that there is no more rebellion, and religion, all of it, is for Allah only. Allah must have no rivals.?

quran quran 008.057 ?If you gain mastery over them in battle, inflict such a defeat as would terrorize them, so that they would learn a lesson and be warned.?

Ishaq:326 ?If you come upon them, deal with them so forcibly as to terrify those who would follow them that they may be warned. Make a severe example of them by terrorizing Allah?s enemies.?"
,Pirate 32,2006-05-13T08:36Z,"PERHAPS SOME OF THE FOLLOWING PASSAGES WOULD HAVE GIVEN HIM AN INSIGHT INTO MUHAMMAD's MIND:

Ishaq:309 ??Bind Abu Aziz tight for his mother is rich and she may ransom him for a great deal of money,??

Tabari VII:71/Ishaq:312 ?The Prophet said, ?Abbas, you must ransom yourself, your two nephews, Aqil and Nawfal, and your confederate, Utbah, for you are a wealthy man.? ?Muhammad,? Abbas said, ?I was a Muslim, but the people compelled me to fight against my will.? Allah knows best concerning your Islam,? Muhammad said. ?If what you say is true, Allah will reward you for it. As for your outward appearance, you have been against us, so pay to ransom yourself.? The Messenger had previously taken [stolen] twenty ounces of gold from him following the battle. So Abbas said, ?Credit me with this amount towards my ransom.? ?No,? Muhammad replied. ?That money Allah has already taken from you and given to us.??"
,Pirate 32,2006-05-13T08:37Z,"Tabari VII:71/Ishaq:311 ?Among the captives was Abu Wada. Muhammad said, ?He has a son who is a shrewd merchant with much money.? The son ?slipped away at night, went to Medina, ransomed his father for 4,000 dirhams.?

Ishaq:313 ?The Muslims told Abu Sufyan to pay them a ransom to free his son, Amr. He replied, ?Am I to suffer the double loss of my blood and my money? After you have killed my son Hanzala, you want me to pay you a ransom to save Amr???

Ishaq:327 ?Allah made booty lawful and good. He used it to incite the Muslims to unity of purpose. So enjoy what you have captured.?"
,katamail,2006-07-07T11:29Z,"I say deport all muslim's as we are at war with terrorism and 99.9% of the terrorist's are muslims, in the Second world war the U.S either deported or imprisoned all Japanese living in the country and they were'nt going around bombing skyscrapers or train stations."
,Vicodin,2006-10-24T00:11Z,Seed please
,useruser0101,2008-05-20T02:31Z,"Okay well, big thanks for the torrent, but enough of the ignorant discussion on religion and deporting Muslims."
,avviker,2009-06-17T15:39Z,"""Pirate 32""....you must read and interpret the entire Qur'an, before you make any decisions. You can not pick out one or two paragraphs from the book and believe that you have to realize the full relegionen. Remember, Islam is the major relegion it takes many years to understand what a relegion is about (especially Islam) and one can interpret Islam in many ways."
,Gangxsta,2010-04-15T11:39Z,"propz for the drop, fuck yall haters"
,FireSign,2010-06-30T18:17Z,"Yes, Avviker is totally correct. The Quran commands a follower to obey the ENTIRE Quran, not pick out bits to follow. Muhammad is the ideal role model for all Muslims. The way he lived was without sin - no matter what anyone says. He lived within the rules of Islam, and peace followed him everywhere he went!

Muhammad ONLY took up the sword when he had to! The first time he did was when he was being attacked by the Meccans (After they persecuted and exiled him).. THere were just over 300 Muslims, many old and many young - with crappy weapons, they had to fight against around 1000 horsed Meccan cavilary. 

Muhammad taught Muslims how to fight during war, we arn't aloud to kill innocents, women or children, anyone in a house/building of residence, anyone who seeks protection/refuge - Muhammad even told the Muslims not to bother any animals, AND ALSO to not harm PLANTS.

When the Meccans violated a peace treaty with the Muslims, Muhammad had a huge army by then.. Muhammad marched his army ack to Mecca. Mecca exiled Muhammad & the followers of Islam for 13 whole years, disallowing even trade, they treated Muhammad very badly, and tried to assasinate him a few times, they desperately wanted him dead. When Muhammad marched his army to Mecca after the Meccans violated their peace treaty, Muhammad didn't harm a single person! He offered them peace (Islam).

Muhammad condemed killing innocents. Infact the people of Yathrib (Median - Christians and Jews) WANTED Muhammad to lead them, since the Christian and Jewish tribes used to massacre eachother. Muhammad agreed, and solved the bloodfueds in Medina, he taught each Muslim to care for his neighbours, and Muhammad loved the Christians/Jews very much!

Infact, some of the biggest Mosques in those days were also being used by Christians.

The actions of Muhammad, and the way of Islam lead the world out of the dark ages!

Who ever bad mouths Islam is an uneducated idiot."
