DVD Compilation of assorted conspiracy Documentaries. With interactive menus.

1) "Who Killed Diana?" English Documentary. Great stuff on the cover up! She was murdered. It is obvious.

2) "Truth and Lies In The War On Terror". John Pilger Documentary. Hard to get.

3) "Mohummed Atta & The Venice Flying Circus". Danial Hopsicker. Details the lack of investigating into the Florida flight schools by the FBI.

4)"Judgement: The Pictures That Fooled The World". Jared Isarel produced this. Excellent stuff on the framing of Serbia and it's 'concentration camps'. A must watch. BTW Jared...what the hell has happened to you? Being a shill for Israel is not what I expected from you.

I use DivXToDVD software to get the AVI converted then use TMPG DVD Author to compile them and make the menu's.

Reasonable bit rate.
