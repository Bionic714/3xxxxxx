Having problems watching your xvid films on your pc?

Then try these two programs to help you view your movies.



Xvid Codec:


This is the one i use and it works every xvid film ive had i even do dvd ripping with this codec.


VLC media player:


Or if you dont want the xvid codec use this for your player for films it has its own codecs and will even play VTS files from a dvd and svcd files.



Hope im helpful with these cause it would be no good if you cant watch your films on your pc.
