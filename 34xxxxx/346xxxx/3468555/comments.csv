,dmasterp,2009-05-17T07:08Z,"I was writing a comment about how this movie was blacklisted by the Bush Administration and thus unavailable for retail distribution and going for as much $250 on half.com for the DVD and doing a search for info on the movie to include in this comment I finally found the movie for sale after searching for about 7 years at 
http://www.antiquityfilms.net/panther1995dvd.html for only $14.99 I am amazed, and of course I immediately purchased it and if things work out okay I may make my first upload here.  

Here is the cast of this great production:
Kadeem Hardison ... Judge
Bokeem Woodbine ... Tyrone
Joe Don Baker ... Brimmer
Courtney B. Vance ... Bobby Seale
Tyrin Turner ... Cy
Marcus Chong ... Huey Newton
Anthony Griffith ... Eldridge Cleaver
Bobby Brown ... Rose
Angela Bassett ... Dr. Betty Shabazz
Nefertiti ... Alma
James Russo ... Rodgers
Jenifer Lewis ... Rita
Chris Rock ... Yuck Mouth
Roger Guenveur Smith ... Pruitt
Michael Wincott ... Tynan

It is one Heaven of an ensemble...the acting is great, the story line is very historically accurate, and does show the pros and cons of all parties, the government and the panthers. "
