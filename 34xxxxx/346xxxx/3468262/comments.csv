,Burlak,2007-01-14T22:52Z,"I haven't downloaded this so I cant say nething bout the quality of the file, but I have the movie and it's very good I think. 
It takes some of the most credible antisemitic arguements in-depth (not just the usual holocaust denial and sieg-heil-sessions) and then tells the viewer why it's all a big, ignorant, childish lie.

I recommend it to everyone, especially to all with their nicks ending with 88(Heil Hitler), and crazy zionists for that matter. they all need perspective."

,guhlitz,2008-09-06T04:43Z,More nazi propaganda on these comments than the meditation this film provides on modern day confusion and where and how religion and politics come together to prevent idiot violence and mental terrorism...........
