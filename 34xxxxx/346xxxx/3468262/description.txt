a movie about Daniel, young Jew who became a nazi. he alienates himself from whole jewish culture due to past failures at jeshiva. during the film he discovers, that not being a Jew doesn't mean being antisemitic, and that it's not so easy to separate oneself from the roots.

I recomend this movie very much.
