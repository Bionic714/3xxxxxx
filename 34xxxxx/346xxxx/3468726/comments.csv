The movie itself is an excellent Polish comedy. Quite old and not a high budget one, but the story and humour are hillarious.

Dzieki!"
,Frankenhedgie,2012-07-13T16:05Z,"Unfortunately the audio and video drift gradually out of sync, and the English subtitles I found on opensubtitles.org go out of sync with both audio and video.  Frustrating!  Still, excellent movie and worth seeding if this is the only torrent out there."
