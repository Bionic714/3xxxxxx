It is really nice that you respect your swedish language, but face the fact that most of the users of this site is not from england, sweden or USA. We are from all over the world. It would be much easier if we all write in one language that we all understand. So I would recomend something. Since I dont understand sweden and I believe you dont understand Bosnian, that we use language that will help us cross that barrier. Thank you"
,whokilledbambi,2007-02-03T01:05Z,"Since the program is entirely in swedish you must understand swedish, otherwise it wont help you at all. Thats why the instructions are in swedish...."
,ornered,2007-12-31T10:00Z,"Hmm, itÂ´s bilingual both swedish and english"
