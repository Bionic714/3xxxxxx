,lordsys,2006-04-07T16:41Z,"UNFORTUNATELY i will wait for a new release, because i don't think this one will ever work correctly.the only thing that i regret is the time that i spent dl this file. "
,Danzkaa,2006-04-09T15:57Z,"What is this shit. Can't unrar it....says:

This disc contains a ""UDF"" file system and requires an operating system
that supports the ISO-13346 ""UDF"" file system specification.
Waste of time and dl for shit like this!!!!"
,adthrawn,2006-04-10T21:46Z,you don't need to extract. Just mount and it will run. Is anybody else having installation problems?
,andregcasal,2006-04-11T03:45Z,"Doesn't work either here...

Like adthrawn can extract with WinRar, just a Readme.txt file. When trying to install with VMWare it gives an error, don't know what exacly, but the thing is -> it doesn't work...

Greetings"

,insomniaklad,2006-04-12T07:23Z,"To anyone having an issue activating it:

Start Run ""msconfig""

Permit Folder ""Services"" STOP ""Software Licensing Service"" STOP ""SL UI Notification Service"" Apply Close Restart Your machine will then tell you, this machine is unlicensed!

Enjoy..."

Can be emulated, and installed, which is what I did."
,orphan01,2006-04-13T06:02Z,I hope insomniakid isnt lying. I hate to wait so long only to figure out i cant crack it yet
,littleshit,2006-04-13T22:02Z,"I dont have any problems with installing it.
