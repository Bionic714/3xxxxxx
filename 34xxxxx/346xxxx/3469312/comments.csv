,greylion,2007-01-01T14:12Z,"Some stupid fuck apparently deleted the last file (Session 1.mpcpl) after he started seeding this, so now it never finishes. This stupid fuck probably didn't realize that bittorrent doesn't rearrange the last blocks of data into place until 100% has been downloaded.
Therefore several of the files are broken in places, if you try to play them when you reach only 99.8 or 99.9 %."
,xLeeynax,2007-07-14T18:45Z,"got to 99.9%.. god i want this so much!

Does that mean that it will never complete or what?
This has been downloading for like..2 weeks >."
