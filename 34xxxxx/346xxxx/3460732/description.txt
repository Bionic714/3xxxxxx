Synopsis: 

A liberal dose of humor is lumped in with the horror in this sequel to the 1989 hit based on Stephen King's novel. Edward Furlong is Geoff, the new kid in a small Maine town, whose veterinarian father has relocated after the death of his wife. After a friend's dog is killed, Geoff and the boy discover and make use of a "sematary" with the power to reanimate the dead. It isn't long before dead people are placed in the special soil and the boys have some true, gory problems on their hands.
