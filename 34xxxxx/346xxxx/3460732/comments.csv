,Tommyen,2006-03-21T22:30Z,"Thanx! But just wanna ""warn"" everyone - this is not Stephen King. King wrote Pet Sematary, but he never wrote a sequel. The filmmakers had such a success with the original that they decided to make a sequel. But as I said, this is not Stephen Kings work. 

Still, great upload - thanx! BTW - Norwegian subs??"
,=michael=,2006-03-21T22:36Z,"could someone upload Pet_Sematary

,adriantanase,2006-04-07T17:43Z,"Yet I found out how to write it with nero:in the event log says that the file ""VIDEO_TS.VOB"" (154 kb) is not referenced and should not be present , so I moved it and I wrote without it"
