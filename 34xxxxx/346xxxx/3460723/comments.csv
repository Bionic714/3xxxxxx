,SephirothLQ,2006-08-16T00:49Z,Can someone please seed this game o.o
,scb8g,2006-09-08T21:01Z,"Seeding...  but hey, I don't have a mod chip.  I am new to downloading PS2 games.  Is there a way to make this work?  I would really appreciate it.  I'll be seeding this for a while.."
,scb8g,2006-09-16T23:33Z,"Look, I am seeding this torrent, and according to utorrent, I'm the only one.  I want people to be able to play this game.  But I need my bandwidth for other things.  Please seed once you're done downloading this."
,-pete-,2006-11-10T00:10Z,"hey man, if you keep seeding then I will help, its only a 10 meg connection but its better than nothing :)"
,mhdj14,2007-06-27T21:25Z,"PLEASE SEAD?!?!?!?!?!?
:)(:"
,Toraie,2008-05-31T13:43Z,"I'll seed this.

>You don't need a modchip anymore, scb. If you've got a clunky PS2, buy a switch-key or whatever they are. If you have slimline, buy a flip top. And you'll need Swap Magic for both of them."

,cloud1414,2008-10-26T21:09Z,"im stuck on 99.8%
what gets me is that the site says one seeder. but when im on bitcomet it says there are 8 seeders but no one is seeding. what the hell XD 
sorry its just frustrating :("
,StormchaserOne,2008-10-30T07:58Z,"To Cloud 1414 !!

So, when the torrent finally reached 100% you dropped out...leaving the seed to someone else..huh. Stop whining if you donÂ´t intend to seed yourself....."
,StormchaserOne,2008-10-30T07:59Z,PS. Last message goes to ALL that complained.....and instantly dropped out !!
,cyberg81,2012-06-29T14:21Z,"Seems like a pretty well supported torrent though, if it's been going for six years.."
