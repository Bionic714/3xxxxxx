,The_torn_prince,2006-03-27T02:21Z,What's this?
,TheQuestor,2006-03-27T02:27Z,"I took about 75 in game screen caps of the map, and assembled them in photoshop. This is the world map in TES Oblivion"
,kirre34,2006-03-27T02:33Z,What is this? What to you mean?
,Churchills Dog,2006-03-27T02:39Z,"world map for the Elder Scrolls: Oblivion game.

why aren't you playing? All the rest of are....."
,Churchills Dog,2006-03-27T02:41Z,Wow. Nice job Questor! Thanks :)
,NBK_DESERT_WOLF,2006-03-27T03:10Z,"thanks 
nice quality "
,TheQuestor,2006-03-27T04:38Z,"and don't forget HUGE lol. I could have done it in jpg or png, but I didn't want any artifacting. So BMP was it :(. 
I just got tired of having to scroll a million times on that little ingame map :P

Hope you find it useful."
,Zoraster,2006-03-27T05:23Z,"besides going to the store, I haven't seen Oblivion on bit torrent. is there another web site that might be sharing it?"
,TheQuestor,2006-03-27T06:38Z,"This one is WORTH buying! 

I decided to do a high-res map pack of each town as well. Chorrol is complete. Rest to follow in the next few days."
,blargisme,2006-03-27T07:57Z,"Yeah, I bought it too! Well worth the $$$!"
,omega55,2006-03-27T09:27Z,"not to sound like an ass, but this is just the basic continent map, you probably could get better detail from the prima guide. btw a jpg would have been a better choice of formats"
,TheQuestor,2006-03-27T13:20Z,"alas, but you did anyway. Don't download it."
,312.karl,2006-03-27T13:22Z,"great work, thanks!

next time, try PNG format instead of BMP... "
,lotheac,2006-03-31T12:36Z,"""I could have done it in jpg or png, but I didn't want any artifacting. So BMP was it :(.""

PNG is lossless. Use that."
,druchii,2006-04-05T21:33Z,"This is SOOOOOO nice:D

Tnx all!!!"
,faneskapen,2006-04-08T22:50Z,How does it work?
