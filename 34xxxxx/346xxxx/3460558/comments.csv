Feelings Awesome :) But now I can't make up my mind whether to download it or not after reading the above comments about some virus shit... Someone please say it CLEARLY, IF THIS THING IS FKD UP OR NOT???"
,Blacker.Death.Metal,2012-03-25T05:50Z,"aenpaa
Win32 virus huh? Sounds really serious, and not at all like a generic warning. 
Perhaps your shitty anti-virus isn't quite sure of the details of the virus? Maybe because... i don't know... its not a virus? maybe? no?...

Used to love this game. No one mentioned if it works on windows 7 64 bit, but i guess i'll see. Now if i can only find my copy of Tony hawks pro skater 2, i'll be living in heaven again."
