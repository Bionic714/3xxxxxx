,PopArt,2006-04-06T22:15Z,"@Su-30: this torrent is 12 minutes young. Don't come here telling me to seed. If you know me, you wouldn't say this. Did you ever upload something? I hope you're just kidding, right?"
,PopArt,2006-04-06T22:17Z,"Sorry guys, but this just pisses me off! I wrote in the torrent (at the bottom) about my seeding habits. I didn't even get the time to fire up Azureus! I mean...12 minutes :-("
,dreamer63,2006-04-06T22:23Z,Thx !
,aloha1,2006-04-06T22:25Z,"PopArt you are great!

,luke97,2006-04-06T22:42Z,"Dear Pop, any chance of having only the SP1? You know why... ;-)

Tnx!"
,Kaluleomorir,2006-04-06T22:42Z,"Thanks PopArt, you rule my friend."
,PopArt,2006-04-06T22:43Z,@luke97: I know why lol. Read your PM please.
,priates,2006-04-07T00:07Z,"Can I only have the SP1 like what luke said? Have not been active recently due to personal issues.

Su-30, fuck off. You are not welcome here."
,priates,2006-04-07T00:08Z,"Sorry for double posting, but how do you upload a torrent? I would like to upload the Flytampa Dubai Scenery by FSSR for those who missed downloading it. Or am I not allowed to do it because it came from FSSR?"
,PopArt,2006-04-07T00:14Z,"I think [FSSR] won't mind. They have the same goal...sharing as much FS stuff as possible ;-) About how to upload, there has been a tut here on TPB, perhaps someone can point you there (it is a torrent)."
,priates,2006-04-07T00:30Z,"I'm now trying to upload, but it says ""Invaild tracker"". what is wrong?"
,FSSR.Lav,2006-04-07T00:31Z,"Priates, check MP please."
,priates,2006-04-07T00:33Z,Checked and replied. ;-)
,priates,2006-04-07T00:41Z,"Anyone knows what to do when you get ""invaild tracker"" when you upload? I am getting it now.

re pss 777 - is there any way to only get the sp1 because i have the original pss 777"
,McPorra,2006-04-07T00:44Z,"PopArt: Another great upload. THX. 
priates: find info here: http://thepiratebay.org/details.php?id=3455676 
More stuff to come this weekend: Flight1 ATR CD. 
SHARING IS MORE FUN THAN DOWNLOADING "
,priates,2006-04-07T00:49Z,"downloaded the file mcporra, but can't open it."
,priates,2006-04-07T00:54Z,ok i think that it is fine now. i have uploaded the file.
,priates,2006-04-07T00:56Z,Deleted it because it was 9.48kb and the OMDB scenery can't be just 9.48 kb. It is 14.4mb instead. can anyone tell me what is happening?
,priates,2006-04-07T01:08Z,have tried and tried but to no avail. i guess i'll leave it to the pros to upload. :-(
,B744,2006-04-07T01:32Z,read your pm priates 
,blindchicken,2006-04-07T01:41Z,I'd also request SP1 only if possible. Thanks in advance!
,McPorra,2006-04-07T02:29Z,"priates 
You seem not to have a NFO reader, so just rename the file that you've got, adding .TXT at the end of it. That way you can read it with Notepad. "
,priates,2006-04-07T02:37Z,I just re-uploaded it. Seems like it's sucessful now. :-D
,Bob_T,2006-04-07T02:55Z,Thanks PopArt. Been waiting for SP1 for awhile now. Never could manage to fly the old version. :)
,Bob_T,2006-04-07T02:59Z,"@blindchicken, do you have the DVD version or the download version? 

If it's the DVD version, you can head over to JustFlights forums and download it from there. If it's the download version, well, I think we all want that one. ;)"
,Panodilo,2006-04-07T08:12Z,Does this have the fuel planner?
,luke97,2006-04-07T08:29Z,"Request: Serial for the CLS Airbus A340 SP1
The patch asks for the key. I have a RIP version of this plane. :-(  
Any help is appreciated.  PM me.
S!"
,Bob_T,2006-04-07T11:07Z,"@Panodilo, based on the fact that it's the DVD version I would say yes. And Pop also said it did in his description. ;)"
,blindchicken,2006-04-07T11:18Z,"@Bob: it's the download version ;-)
I thought the SP1 might be extractable from the DVD. How come the big size anyway? My DL-Version has zipped 91MB!
"
,Bob_T,2006-04-07T12:01Z,"@blindchicken

As for SP1 with this, it won't work on the download version. I downloaded it from the JustFlight forums and tried to apply it to the DL version of this I got from here. Didn't work, it asked me for the correct DVD or something along those lines. 

Now someone might be able to crack that and make it work with the DL version I don't know, but until that happens, I would just say download this if you aren't already.

If you want to try it, just go to the JustFlight forums and download the patch. Maybe somehow it will work on yours.

As for the size difference, couldn't tell you and I was wondering the same thing. Heck, the DL version I have is only 51megs zipped. But I don't have the load editor, panel confguration utility or any of the liveries."
,blindchicken,2006-04-07T12:12Z,"@Bob

no worries, I take comfort in the LvlD 767 until that issue is solved ;-)
Thanks for the upload!"
,PopArt,2006-04-07T14:09Z,"About the size: it is Just Flight's way to fill a DVD with a lot of crap, like trailers of other add-ons. Something you'll have to live with ;-)"
,elijah_87,2006-04-07T16:18Z,http://tranceport.be/  a new download site
,Brick Driver,2006-04-08T12:03Z,Can this file be installed without mounting to a DVD? I don't have a dvd writer. Thanks.
,iikaa,2006-04-08T20:14Z,"I get an error -6001 when trying to apply the SP1 . I used Alcohol to mount the image . 
I use Win Xp SP1"
,Panodilo,2006-04-09T09:33Z,"Hello, Popart. Say, buddy, what happened to the Flight1 ATR that you uploaded. It has vanished from the listing it seems."
,PHBFO,2006-04-09T13:02Z,"Hey PopArt, thanks man, you rule!
But one question, I'm downloading now, but how do you install this one? with installeren or is it .ISO or .CUE whatver file. Or is it a RIP?"
,boytal,2006-04-09T15:19Z,"I downloaded the aircraft but I don't understand how to install it.  Can some please explain?
??????

THANKYOU"
,PHBFO,2006-04-09T17:37Z,"Yes, how do you install?"
,iikaa,2006-04-09T17:43Z,PHBFO  read the readme . You need Alcohol 120 to mount the image into a virtual drive . then you should install the SP1 . Apparently I am the only one getting an error with the Patch.
,PHBFO,2006-04-09T20:02Z,"Yes I've read the Readme, and I also downloaded Alcohol 120, but I still don't get it. Is there a tutorial somwhere?
And I also get that error."
,Brick Driver,2006-04-09T21:38Z,Ok I've figured out how to install this and I never got the error when installing the patch either. Thanks PopArt!!!
,iikaa,2006-04-10T00:11Z,"PHBFO You need to use the image to mount a Virtual Drive.  Open alcohol 120% . select Options Virtual Drive make sure at least one virtual drive is enabled  .

 Select one Virtual Drive Device (in my system is F: ) , Right Click on the device name [Look down   on the screen ] and select Mount image . Select the image and you should be fine. 

Download this SP1 I managed to install the patch from this one  : 
http://80.68.88.211/jf/secure_updates/777/777SP1.exe"
,Panodilo,2006-04-10T07:25Z,Does this come with a PDF manual?
,Panodilo,2006-04-10T07:42Z,"Nevermind, I downloaded the manuals from a third party. All five of them, jeeez! This is going to require some studying."
,zipperflyer,2006-04-10T09:50Z,If you are having troubles installing SP1. Check Just Flight's support forum. They have some solutions there :)
,PHBFO,2006-04-10T18:18Z,"I still don't get it sorry, could explain it better (sorry) step by step?"
,PHBFO,2006-04-10T18:21Z,"I mean, how do you select the virtual device? and if I click on the tab Device, the Monut Image button is not clickable."
,Panodilo,2006-04-10T21:42Z,Use Virtual Daemon instead.
,Panodilo,2006-04-10T21:43Z,The only thing Alcohol does is make you want some
,FC5452,2006-04-13T23:33Z,"Just want to Thank PopArt for the advise, I used Alcohol120% the trial version, and I am impressed, what a Unique way to Back up your disks :) Going to spend the $$$ and get this...

I am going to try to do the same as you with the ATR Stay tuned :)"
,steffmak,2006-04-14T15:29Z,"Hello All

,steffmak,2006-04-21T19:27Z,"Yea mate use Deamon tools to install, i cant get the update to work with anything so if you have any joy let me know

Cheers"
,Bob_T,2006-04-22T03:11Z,"Just use daemon tools like you did to install. Leave the CD mounted, then select and install the patch.

I can't figure out why it wouldn't work, I know I didn't have any problems with it. Seems strange you can install, but not use the patch."
,jontoupin,2006-04-26T06:16Z,Thx
,BrewsterPilot,2006-04-30T20:21Z,"OK, guys, I admit, I'm an idiot but can't ANYONE here write a step by step guide on how to install like:

1.First download the file
2.Then download and install programs blah blah blah
3. Then open the file in the program ""blah"" and click on file -> blahblah. . .
