,sepdri,2006-04-05T18:05Z,nice up
,diakkaml,2006-04-16T21:11Z,It looks like the first fight (Gordeau vs. Tuli) is missing.  It just gets skipped in my DVD software.  Does that happen for everyone else?
,daqck,2006-04-18T01:25Z,I guess its your DVD software
,diakkaml,2006-04-18T02:19Z,"daqck:  be sure and check closely.  I didn't notice at first.  If the first fight you see on the DVD is Roseir vs Frazier, (A white guy & a black guy) then you are missing the first fight."
,daqck,2006-04-18T20:05Z,"I did read some where about this. It was only on ppv. but if you want the whole thing (all fights) its been released here in whole :-
