thanx"
,brimstonemetal,2006-08-08T22:45Z,"This is not a part of the TV-series but a disc with bonus material(documentaries and making of... etc.).
It´s therefore possible to enjoy the full story without this disc.
Eventhough, it would be nice if someone could seed it anyway."

If they do should they have been available a lot of times while I have waited. Are there anyone that have been able to reach 100,0%? Please, if so, add a comment and tell us!"

,nboom,2007-07-01T11:36Z,"It would be nice to have 100%. As stated before, we are stuck at 99.3%. Could someone please seed a few minutes to help us get the last 0.7%? Thanks."
