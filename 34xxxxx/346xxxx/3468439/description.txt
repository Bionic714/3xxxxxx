Star Trek Voyager Season 7 Disk 4 DVD Rip. NTSC 

The Federation starship USS Voyager, chasing a band of 
Maquis rebels, enters the dangerous space nebula known 
as the Badlands. Both ships are transported by a distant 
space probe to the Delta Quadrant, 75,000 light-years from 
Federation space. Voyager's crew and the Maquis form an 
uneasy truce to rescue crewmen of both ships, kidnapped 
by the probe's builder, the powerful, dying Caretaker. 
The Maquis ship is destroyed in a battle with the warlike 
Kazons. To prevent a Kazon aggression against a helpless 
world, Voyager destroys the space probe. Without the probe,
it will take 75 years for Voyager to travel back to 
Federation space. With the differences between them 
rendered meaningless by time and distance, The Federation 
and Maquis crews unite aboard Voyager. Together, 
they embark on their new mission: to boldly go - home.
