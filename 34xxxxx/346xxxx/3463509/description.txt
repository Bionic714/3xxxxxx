This torrent contains two Iso files from each disc of "The History of Beavis and Butt-Head."  This DVD was recalled when Mike Judge was informed about it 
and it never hit shelves (well for the most part.) They made it without his input and permission so it was never officially released. 
From what I read this has sold for 300-400 dollars at times on Ebay, a true collection for any B and B fan.
