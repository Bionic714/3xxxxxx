,TEBBIF,2006-04-07T07:29Z,"I don't understand how this could be season 2, when Fox broadcasting anounces that all new episodes will be released on April 23

[V],Rydiso,2006-04-07T19:14Z,this isn't season 2 becouse it hasn't started yet. the so called secound season you can download starts with the 8th episode in the first season
,kajke,2006-05-20T16:27Z,Jepp detta är säsong 1. Och även om det hade varit säsong 2 så hade den ju inte varit komplett då det isåfall skulle varit minst 16 avsnitt
,onepixelsquare,2006-07-10T15:54Z,What codec please? I've tried lots...
,smuffy,2006-08-08T19:11Z,"Here's the actual content. (see wiki entry on episode numbers).  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_American_Dad%21_episodes

201 = 108 ""Bullocks To Stan"" 
202 = 109 ""A Smith In The Hand""
203 = 110 ""All About Steve""
204 = 111 ""Con Heir""
205 = 112 ""Stan of Arabia: Part 1""
206 = 113 ""Stan of Arabia: Part 2""
207 = 114 ""Stannie Get Your Gun""
208 = 115 ""Star Trek""
209 = 116 ""Not Particularly Desperate Housewives""
210 = 117 ""Rough Trade""
211 = 118 ""Finances With Wolves""

Unfortunately, am having trouble finding the rest of season 1 (119-123). The confusion over ""season 1 vs season 2"" numberings is not helping."
,driveonaparkwayparkonadri,2007-04-05T06:04Z,I wish I knew what the german guy is saying
,stanerbrÃ¸d,2007-04-10T14:33Z,can you please seed
,Nicalapegus,2007-04-16T19:03Z,"and he wishes he knew what you were saying.

,Sachinb,2008-02-10T11:46Z,I think the german dude is saying something like hail Hitla or something
,willegott,2008-02-18T14:27Z,SEED SEED SEED :D thx(Y)
,-Keys-,2008-03-07T10:42Z,"Well Sachinb, you seem to be making fun of someone because he's speaking Swedish.

I've got to say that seems pretty ungrateful, considering that it was Swedish people that made this website. It's currently owned, maintained and funded by Swedish people. If it wasn't for Swedish law, torrenting probably wouldn't be as successful as it is today.

So somehow I doubt your ignorance is going to impress many people, better luck next time though."
,cmcchere,2008-03-20T16:40Z,-Keys- is totally right man so stop being gay and trying to be funny!!!
,dousch,2008-05-11T12:21Z,"This torrent is actully GREAT! Because there are alot of episodes in the one (And only) torrent here on piratebay who has really really bad quality, atleast for a guy like me, I prefer DvDrips and well the Season 1 i have is only like 7 episodes of good quality. So I got these instead and almost got all of them good! :)"
,cafltlad,2008-12-04T02:58Z,Think some of the above confusion is explained in another torrent file I found on here - there were in fact 2 seasons originally which then officially became season one - complicated but hope it helps solve some issues!
