As I promised (threatened?), here is the remix of the fairly recent a-ha song Celice. Using a friend's wonderful gadgets, I've taken the fine remix done by Thomas Schumacher and turned it into something way out there: a 13 minute piece to make you want to tear your hair, perhaps. Well, it's all done for fun. Used instruments and virtual instruments include
