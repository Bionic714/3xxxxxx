My original mistake.

Be patient, i'll seed til the cows come home."
,NickManch,2011-05-04T15:01Z,There seem to be 6 leachers now but no seeders. Any chance someone can seed this again? I will carry on seeding once it's downloaded. Thanks.
,NickManch,2011-05-05T03:40Z,"Any chance someone can seed this please? I know it was a while ago now but there are TWENTY people mostly with about 29.1% including myself. If it's ok with someone else, we'd pretty much like the other 70.9% as well please. Any chance of this and I'm sure we'd all be most grateful. Cheers."
,NickManch,2011-05-07T11:56Z,"Sorry guys - I know this is a long shot because the uploader last left a message in 2005 but can SOMEONE please kindly seed this for a bit? We now have TWENTY SEVEN peers trying to download this and all stuck at 29.1% :( If someone can seed this until 1 or 2 of us have it, I'm sure we'll happily continue seeding it until the rest have it too. Many thanks in anticipation and if anyone reading this knows KonspiracyKooknspiracyKoo, please can you let him know to come here and check this out?! :)"
