,skillz708,2006-04-14T19:53Z,Once I downloaded the game how do I load it on to a disc?
,ss84,2006-04-15T15:25Z,"You need a DVD burner and a blank DVD +/- R.

Also need a program that can burn images such as Alcohol 120% or DVD Decrypter. (then just set the program to burn an image, select the downloaded image, put in the blank disc and burn)"

,Kuntitled,2012-02-06T09:42Z,"For those who cant play, i'll (try to) help.
To play it on your modded ps2, just grab the .iso file, and burn it to a blank DVD-R with x4 speed.

For those who want to play it on PC, any ps2 emulator will do :P."

,s0tne67,2012-05-29T10:13Z,siriuslt no seeds? come on guys why? :S
,wynethng,2012-05-31T19:15Z,"After the download has completed; I have proceeded to unzip to my desktop; using WinZip. Now; after all of the files are unloaded; do I proceed to burn ""ALL"" of the files to the disk? I will try this, because the .iso file that is SPECIFICALLY named kh2 = 0kb, which doesn't seem right at all. A video game isn't 0kbs."
,wynethng,2012-05-31T20:08Z,"Nevermind that; was using Poweriso instead of Alcohol. Pooweriso was picking up on some weird error, wouldn't let me burn; but Alcohol seems to be making Poweriso show it Gynee."
,wynethng,2012-05-31T20:48Z,"OKAY; I'm giving up on this torrent for now; and unless someone can help out with getting it to work properly on PS2... Yeah... 
NOTE: I have a copy of Chain Of Memories; I slipped it into my laptop; and there are only a total of 3 files on this disk; none of which follow an irx. extension. Left in the dark here; imagining some bastard sitting up enjoying the game when I can't even get my disk to spin. Help?"
,Franky3121,2012-07-23T13:19Z,U dont have to burn it on a disc if ur gonna use the emulator
