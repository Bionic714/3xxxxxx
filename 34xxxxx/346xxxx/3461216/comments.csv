,AmateurHistorian,2009-05-03T11:54Z,"I bought the CD, and the Gimme Some Lovin' track IS crippled on the album. Unbelievable that they would have let this get through their process. I found a good .flac (lossless) version, converted it to .mp3 with Audacity, and replaced the bad original version.  Click on my user name to see the new torrent with the replaced track."
