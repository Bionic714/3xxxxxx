,samtheman11,2007-03-05T11:48Z,"WOW!!!
You must think people are super stupid if you think you can fool them into believing that this office suite is only 106 BYTES!"
,samtheman11,2007-03-05T11:59Z,Maybe next you should try to put somewhere in your summary that this is the ACTIVATION and not the whole suite as you made it seem.
,Newb787,2008-03-14T21:05Z,"Common sense says this is an activation only.  Reading previous posts, this activation doesnt work.

Next."
,greenbile,2008-03-27T05:01Z,"You want Wordperfect x3? Here are instructions that worked for me. I just downloaded corel x3 trial version from corel website and used the crack from http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3434211/Corel_-_Wordperfect_Office_X3. I did not download the application, just the crack. Before step one unplug internet connection because you want to tell corel you are activating by phone not by internet connection..

1. Start setup/install after unzipping the files
2. When the program asks for trial serial, start keygen and enter the serial under field ""already have trial serial""
3. DO NOT close or regenerate the serial in keygen.
4. Start program after installation
5. Click on ""Enter activation"" - do not click ""buy""
6. Click activate by phone. When program asks for key, enter the serial earlier entered
7. In the keygen enter the number generated by Corel as installation code
8. Click Activate (DO NOT click generate)
9. Enter the activation code manually. Sounds goofy but wouldn't work by cut and paste.
10. Click on Continue and cross fingers.

If it doesn't work, uninstall and start over. Good luck!

I didn't download this torrent but the way I did it actually works."
