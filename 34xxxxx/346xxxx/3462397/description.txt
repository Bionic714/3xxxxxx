Synopsis:

The third "Cube" movie provides more sci-fi horror as a prequel to the original movie. We once again find our unwilling participants frantically moving through a peculiar construct of cube shaped rooms, each holding the potential threat of hideously inventive and painful death. However, finding the exit is only the beginning of an even worse nightmare. Even as we start to learn more about who and what is behind the cube, we are left with even more questions as the cosmic mysteries of the Cube universe are revealed....
