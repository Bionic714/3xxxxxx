Correct me if I`m wrong.. I will have to download all of this, then I will have to make all these ""video_ts"" to a ISO. And then I will have to shrink it to fit a ""normal"" DVD(4,7gb) ?

Hmmm.....  I must have gotten something wrong here..?  Maby this is 2 dvd`s?  

Anyway... Thanks... Have been lookin` 4 this.. =) "
,=michael=,2006-04-03T16:53Z,use dvd shrink to make it fit on a normal dvd or just burn it on a dubble layer good luck
,nura,2006-04-03T16:54Z,"luckystrike.. how about you burn it on dual layer where, i guess it is coming from"
,luckystrike81,2006-04-03T17:36Z,"nura: Ohh??? Really?? Does it?? lmao! 
I was just curious why our good friend here didnt choose to do anything with it. Or if it could actually be 2 dvd`s.. You see my (I`ll take a wild guesse) danish friend... A ""doubble layer"" is mutch more expensive, and I use the printable ones...   


bjamelda123: Thanks again! =) "

,bjamelda123,2006-04-03T19:52Z,it's one dvd.
