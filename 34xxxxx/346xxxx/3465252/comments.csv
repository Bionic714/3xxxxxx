,NosTraDomus,2008-02-17T07:58Z,"UPDATE!
DOwnload VIRTUAL PC from microsoft website, it allows you to install win98 or win200..wat ever O/S and then install this game...it tells you its formatiing c:\ but its not, its creating a Fake Disk image for a partitiion to trick the o/s to install. then its like working with a remote desktop with full screen..either that or buy a $100 system that comes with win98 on it."

,NosTraDomus,2009-05-13T21:34Z,"nothing harmful. its to bypass cd checks, and the trainer injects code into the games memory. you will see this with EVERY game on torrent sites-

to play game, remember!

-dual boot O/S with win98/2000
-pc with O/S win98/2000
-Virtual pc, install win98/2000"

,droidgage13,2009-08-17T23:17Z,Has anyone tested this torrent on windows vista yet?
,NosTraDomus,2009-08-29T05:24Z,"strangeorwhat,
 just copy the crack, which i belive is a *.exe* to the newworlds directory- ""Are you sure you want to overwrite this file?"" -click YES- boom,done


droidgage13,
wont work on Vista, If you have vist ult or higher, you can actually see in groupPolicies vista has 16bit programs Disabled- this is b/c vista cant handle it and vista doesnt have the necessary DX or other drivers. SOrry.
Best thing is using XP
or format HDD using FAT32 either on xp or win98/s.e."
,Universe2010,2010-07-01T22:28Z,"Could anyone help me how to use the trainer?

Now I use Windows 98 SE with only one stick of RAM 512MB.  When I use the trainer, it doesn't work.  I click on the buttons of the 3 options, but the light isn't on.  I don't know what's going on.  Is something wrong with only one memory stick 512MB?"
,NosTraDomus,2010-12-04T02:46Z,"the trainer is a little tricky, i think you have to mine SOME minerals FIRST, then click the button to freeze it..."
