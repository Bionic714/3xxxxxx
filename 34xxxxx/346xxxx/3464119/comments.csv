,KonspiracyKooknspiracyKoo,2006-03-30T19:14Z,"I have 100k upload and a server that runs bit torrent day and night so people just need to be patient.

As for Israel? I'm just glad I live in Oz. The Talmudic monster joooze will kill and deport ALL Arabs at the first oppurtunity...as sson as they can stage manage an attack on themselves to justify their actions to some degree.

God will judge the Scribes and Pharisees."
,bananaman2,2006-03-31T00:42Z,"You guys crack me up. Agreethere are religious fanatical nutters on all sides. Lets hope the moderate people prevail and the blodshed stops.

Personally far more scared of born again Jews/Christians/Muslims and any other religion that directly/indiectly aims at the vulnerable and turns them towards very extreme views that have no form of compromise"

[V],adamvas,2006-04-01T15:36Z,"Jo det liknar egna historie beskrivningar.Ni glömmer så lätt vad som hänt under alla dessa attacker från alla länder runt omkring sedan tidigt 1900-tal.Ryssar o araber har satsat mycket för att förgöra Israel.Och de ska alltså inte få försvara sig..bara vända andra kinden till o dö.Målet har alltid varit att förgöra Israel till sista man,kvinna o barn."

,Pirate 32,2006-05-13T06:55Z,you fucking idiots. the reason there was an occupation in the first place was because of suicide bombers and the like.  If i had to worry about getting blown up by some random islamizombie everywhere i went you're damn right id invade and occupy the source of suicide bombers to protect my people.
,Pirate 32,2006-05-13T06:55Z,"You muslims started this whole thing with israel shortly after they peacefully declared statehood -ON LAND BOUGHT AND PAID FOR FROM MUSLIMS- IN 1949.  Islamizombies from all over the world (mostly turkey and egypt) came to overthrow israel and almost did in the 6 day war.

Now your all pissed because your idioticly murderouse invasion was routed by Israel."
,Pirate 32,2006-05-13T06:56Z,"If the tables were turned, and palestine had the superior warpower (and inteligence) ISRAEL WOULD HAVE BEEN WIPED OFF THE MAP BY NOW.  And all jews would have been killed/raped/tortured and looted.

I have been researching your shit (islam, quran, hadith, muhammads life, history of muslims) for 8 months now and the evidence is clear.  "
,Pirate 32,2006-05-13T06:57Z,"Islam is a dogma that sanctifies intollerence, violence, murder, looting, and jijad.  You palestinians and pakistanians have nothing to bitch about except for the doctrine that drives your people into becoming the murdering madmen that they are."
,Pirate 32,2006-05-13T06:57Z,"IF YOU LIVE IN PALISTEIN, YOU SHOULD THANK ALLA  THAT ISRAEL IS NOT RULED BY YOUR MINDSET!!!!!"

,lovegren,2006-11-02T23:13Z,"Finns kanske skäl varför alla hatar landet Israel och deras befolking, de hör inte hemma där och så länge de befinner sig där är det krig. Ibland får faktiskt folk falla inför trycket. Det handlar inte om judendommen längre...nu är det bara hämnd. Skit ner er ni som klagar på detta. "
[V],SweBullDoG,2006-12-27T00:39Z,"Hur kommer det sig att folk kan gå omkring med amerikanska flaggan över hela tröjan men man kan inte ens ha kippah på sig? USA har alltid fört sina krig på bortaplan medans Israel alltid fått försvara sig ändå är det Israel som får all skit.. Judarna hör visst hemma i Israel, det bodde mestadels judar i Israel även innan staten blev utropad. Arabstaterna får skylla sig själva om dem angriper ett land som slår tillbaka och tar land som kompensation för kriget."
,tomtomx,2007-03-27T14:04Z,"The Israeli Ambassador at the U.N. began,
""Ladies and gentlemen before I commence with my speech, I want to relay an old Passover story to all of you ...
""When Moses was leading the Jews out of Egypt toward the Promised Land, he had to go through the nearly endless Sinai desert. When they reached the Promised Land, the people had become very thirsty and needed water. So Moses struck the side of a mountain with his staff and a pond appeared with crystal clean, cool water. The people rejoiced and drank to their hearts' content.
Moses wished to cleanse his whole body, so he went over to the other side of the pond, took all of his clothes off and dove into the cool waters. Only when Moses came out of the water, he discovered that all his clothes had been stolen. ""And,"" he said, ""I have reasons to believe that the Palestinians stole my clothes.""
The Palestinian delegate to the UN, hearing this accusation, jumps from his seat and screams out, ""This is outrageous! It is widely known that there were no Palestinians there at that time!""
""And with that in mind,"" said the Israeli Ambassador, ""let me now begin my speech......"
,allwin27,2009-02-01T13:33Z,Allah Akbar Means kill kill kill kill kill.this is what these muslims do all the not only in israel but all over the world.we will not let you muslims conquer the world.
