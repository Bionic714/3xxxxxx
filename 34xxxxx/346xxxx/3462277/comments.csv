,sam_aziz78,2006-03-27T23:19Z,i don't understand what is going on here
,Deftone30,2006-03-28T07:47Z,what dont' understand sam_aziz78? You need the program Nero to burn the image onto a dvd recordable disc. 
,Juniro,2006-03-28T11:29Z,"Can't you just use Daemon Tools and mount the image even though its .nrg ?
I've done it before..."
,Deftone30,2006-03-28T11:53Z,Yes you can use daemon tools. I was telling the noobs that don't have a clue what daemon tools is. 
,otrixx,2006-03-28T13:22Z,"You need to write some more info Deftone30.
Is there any subs? And what subs? Is it PAL or NTSC? Is this thing a complete copy of the original DVD or just a rip?"
,Coligor,2006-03-28T13:23Z,"A shame it isn't widescreen :(
Otherwise it's fine."
,Deftone30,2006-03-29T03:41Z,"This is the NTSC Retail DVD image. Fullscreen edition. Subtitles include: English SDH, French, and Espanol

((Answer pls))"
,d-tritus,2006-04-01T05:17Z,"What the hell? Is this a normal ISO file, or some proprietary garbage (.NRG) which you need Windows and Nero to burn?"
,cherusker,2006-04-03T07:00Z,"Great quality, thanks! But Fullscreen  :-(  If I knew...
By the way: Nero-Images (.NRG) can also be burnt under Linux. Just use K3b, it will recognize them..."
