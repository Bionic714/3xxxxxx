,Nightwolfie,2006-03-30T21:46Z,"Well, I like Animatronic as well. I'll make a torrent of it right away ;)"
,Mezziah777,2006-09-15T16:53Z,Please make a torrent of the first record (In Times Before The LIght) I really like that one.
,resonator,2007-06-23T22:29Z,"Track 09 damaged. A good and interesting album, reminding me of KMFDM, Ministry, Paradise Lost etc. Better and more industrial than ""Animatronic""."
