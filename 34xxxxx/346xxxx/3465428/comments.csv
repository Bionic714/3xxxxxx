,MCFC OK,2006-04-02T16:10Z,"@ Gail 

The .exe file won't get uploaded because they requre a valid email address, reg key and password to install. Therefore making it rather easy to trace where the file came from.

Please don't forget to say thanks not only for the file seeder, but also the original uploader (me)"
