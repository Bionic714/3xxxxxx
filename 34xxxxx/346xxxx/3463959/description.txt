In this brand new television experiment, nine strangers are locked in a bunker until they can all decide who is worthy of the $1.5 Million prize. But there is a catch: the longer is takes them to come up with the unanimous decision, the smaller the prize gets. The contestants cannot reach a unanimous decision, though, therefore they have to spend more time in the bunker. Also, since they did not reach a decision, they must select three secrets of the contestants, and choose which one is the worst.
