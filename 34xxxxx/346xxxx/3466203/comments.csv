,Philosogogue,2007-02-06T06:02Z,"You Do not say whether you have a Mac or a PC.  My machines are all Macs.  VLC reads and plays most .vob files individually or from a playlist. It will allow you to choose language tracks and give control over subtitles functions. You can also recreate the movie and sound by streaming it into another format, say h264 with mp4, for instance.  When I have a .vob unrecognizable by Quicktime and MPEG Streamslip--a more versatile application for adjustments, repairs and copying (that is also free), VLC usually offers the simple no cost option.  For working specifically with .avi and mpg3, another useful free app is 'D-Vision' (Mac only).  Luck."
