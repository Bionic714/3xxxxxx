,Eat_shit_fool,2006-04-14T20:53Z,"Kid you just dont get the concept of making backup games do you , try firstly that you have a dvd rewriter or writer and some blank dvd-r ONLY DVD - R DVD-RW AND DVD+R/RW DONT WORK , so if you have the blank disks the firstly, download alcohol 120 % with a crack to make it work then use alcohol 120 % to burn the image of the game you downloaded onto a blank dvd-r and there you go , but last thing and dont forget you need a mod chip of swap magic "
