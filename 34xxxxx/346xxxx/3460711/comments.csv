It should be there after the dos steps."
,Dillipaa,2006-03-21T23:43Z,"this how u do:

1. start cmd
2.type ""dir c:"" and u get all the files in c: harddrive.
3.The default folder should be Program Files so u type ""cd c:Program Files"" and press enter
4.just type ""dir"" to get all the files and folders in Program Files.
5.Then u just type ""cd GnuWin32"" and enter.
6.And last just type ""cd bin"" and enter, and u should be there. just type dir to see the files.
7.So the default installation of bsdtar should be c:Program FilesGnuWin32bin

hope u understood anything ;-)

,deepred,2006-03-21T23:43Z,"But the problem persists, it can't be installed."

Well doesn`t that make you think ?? it doesnt work in daemon nothing works. Great got 4 gb of crap on my computer wel no thanks at all

,Nin9,2006-03-21T23:58Z,"It's not Bear's fuckin fault some of you are morons. You saying you have 4GB of CRAP is the equivalent of me telling you you have 2kg of crap in your head.
If you downloaded all the files properly, you screwed up somewhere in the steps."
,beef38,2006-03-22T00:04Z,Ok you must be patient after step 10 - it comes up with just black in cmd but it is extracting (look in the bin directiory and see the file changing). It takes around 10 mins to complete. Have patience. If your file is only 1.7 gigs or 2.2gig you didnt leave it long enough.
,Alegi,2006-03-22T00:07Z,"Ok so I fount that the .mfd file was in the /Bin map in the freaking BSDTAR map, after getting the error: 

Oblivion.mdf: ZIP compressed data is wrong sizeCan't set permissions: Function n
ot implemented

So all that got the same error, look in the /bin map, It might be in there. But I sure cant get the .msd file though"

First, dont waste your time typing long filenames, dragging a file into CMD instantly types its name perfect.

1. drag BDStar into CMD,
2. add -xf
3. Put a "" d
4. Drag the tar.gz, add last "" (make it in quotes)
4. itll blink and extract, will give you a pointless error, but mds and mdf will appear in the bin folder"
,Curry777,2006-03-22T20:19Z,"@Seifer666
The mdf, mds file appears in BDSTARs bin folder BUT they are 5kb and 50 mb. It's wrong. "

,Kyusabara,2006-03-23T18:34Z,Yeah these instructions kind of suck. I did what it said but still no MSD. I managed to get the .mdf though. Need help. or if the msd file is small email to Kyusabara@hotmail.com
,Draekyn,2006-03-23T19:07Z,I have gotten the same error as you sypher but it doesnt seem like a mfd file appears in the bin folder any help?
,Pettenks,2006-03-23T19:27Z,"Lol... feel like the odd one out, but could anyone send me the mdf file? petterintok@hotmail.com"
,Lord-Ronddraai,2006-03-23T19:39Z,"the mdf is 4,18gb
i don't think anyone will send that to you ;-)"
,TwoyTaylor,2006-03-23T19:43Z,"So much about these instructions are shady. I get lost almost immediatly at step 6 and 7. I added the .001-.086 files like it says. Step 7 says ""wait."" Am I supposed to click create after adding these files? There are several different ""buttons"" to click and different options to choose. Can someone give me a push in the right direction?"
,BearishSun,2006-03-23T21:44Z,"Instructions are perfectly correct, you are just not following them correctly. Opening quickpar BY CLICKING ON quickpar.exe or it's shorcut IS NOT WHAT THE INSTRUCTIONS SAY. Run it by CLICKING ON THE PAR2 file."
,Lord-Ronddraai,2006-03-23T21:52Z,i followed the instructions perfectly but i can't seem to get the oblivion.msd...
,progressions,2006-03-23T22:19Z,"I'm afraid I am confused--when I perform step 6, it's not clear what action I should take before I ""WAIT might take some time...""

I clicked CREATE and waited, and when it finished there was no ""4GB .zip file"".  Should there be?  If so, where would the 4GB .zip file be?

Thanks."

,Thoddin,2006-03-23T23:31Z,"gahhh im exited ^_________^
it seems like i got it working thx bearish"
,revdrlon,2006-03-24T01:29Z,"OKAY! i think what we need here is detailed step by step instructions on how to get the msd file after we get the mdf file, cuz when i do it i get the mdf file but then i try to do the next step and nothing happens, it seems like it does something but nothing new shows up in the bin directory"
,revdrlon,2006-03-24T01:31Z,"^^^its step 12 that im having the problem with, i do everything it says but i dont get the msd file"
,Rowena,2006-03-24T02:41Z,"i give up att stage 9 .... obs dont bother downloading, download the Reloaded insted"
,revdrlon,2006-03-24T03:56Z,"i got it working. to get the mds file open the .tar.gz file with a program called 7zip, you can download 7zip - look it up in yahoo, once you extract it you get the mds file. put that with the mdf file from before and it should run. take up at step 15 and it will work."
,CroatiaFvr,2006-03-24T08:36Z,Thanks Bearish! 
,ssjack,2006-03-24T08:52Z,"can any one send me the MSD file! i get themfd file, but not the msd file.

thanx, i really appreciated

my e-mail is blablazoca@yahoo.com "
,kheros,2006-03-24T11:12Z,"You can just mount the mdf in daemon tools, you don't actually need the msd!!!  Just select 'All file types' when you want to mount an image or type in the name of the mdf file...works like a charm."
,marcelus25,2006-03-24T14:08Z,"I have problem with 10 step ....
i followed instruction and typed
BSDTAR -xf 
and it didnt work ....Help !!!"
,Starcomper,2006-03-24T14:39Z,"What should I do on stage 9, and what do you mean by ""Enter /bin"" ?"
,Starcomper,2006-03-24T14:43Z,Am I supposed to install BsdTar or what?
,dabuh,2006-03-24T17:12Z,"hey,
For all the people who are looking for the mds file i've got the solution. You don't need it. Just start deamon tools. go the the file in which you have placed your mdf file. You won't see the mdf file unless you search for all files in that map. So instead of look for mds files, you must scroll down to look for all files. If you start the mdf file with daemon it will start installing the game."
,Starcomper,2006-03-24T17:54Z,"marcelus25: You're supposed to write not just "" BSDTAR -xf "" but (Example"" BSDTAR -xf  .msd"") this will extract the msd file I think.I haven't tried this myself but the instructions say so."
,Starcomper,2006-03-24T17:57Z,"My mistake on last one, write the Oblivionlocation/Oblivion.tar.gz within  after BSDTAR -xf and then write after that .msd, THAT WILL EXTRACT THE .MSD FILE (At least i think so). my mistake on my last post."
,Starcomper,2006-03-24T17:57Z,Write it within

,crazyhic,2006-03-24T18:01Z,"I am stuck at step 9, what do you mean by ""Find BSDTAR folder, enter /bin, type ""BSDTAR -help""""

Do you mean im to find it in command promt? if so, how and what command do i use?"
,crazyhic,2006-03-24T18:26Z,"Now i am stuck at step 12, i have typed --- ""C:Program FilesGnuwin32binbsdtar.exe"" -xf ""C Program Files BitlordDownloadsTES4OBLIVION-INDOBLIVION-IND.tar.gz.zip""
Where do i put .msd?"

,crazyhic,2006-03-24T19:15Z,"Ok, ive found my problem, its not making the mdf file, ive followed the instruction perfectly, but it just doesnt do it. After about a min of ""thinking"" it does nothing with no resulting mdf file at all. What do i do?"
,crazyhic,2006-03-24T19:16Z,"i entered ""C:Program FilesGnuwin32binbsdtar.exe"" -xf ""C Program Files BitlordDownloadsTES4OBLIVION-INDOBLIVION-IND.tar.gz.zip""

,Vorn,2006-03-24T20:05Z,AARGH! This is so fucking annoying! I'll download the other one.
,crazyhic,2006-03-24T20:26Z,"Thank you BearishSun for your peace of crap instructions, I never thought you caould make me buy it, but i ve been wrong many times b4. You suck, and im never dling another IND release again. Waste of Time."

,TeskoVirgo,2006-04-10T22:54Z,"Crazyhic, the file should be ""OBLIVION-IND.tar.gz"" and the mdf file is sent to the /bin dir if that helps any.


NOTE TO ALL:  If you have any characters in the file path that aren't letters, numbers, periods, or dashes, and are having problems, try putting the path in quotes (ex: ""C:Documents and SettingsuserTesko's StuffOblivion-IND.tar.gz"") just like Crazyhic did below...

But I'm having problems getting the .MDS file... grr..."
