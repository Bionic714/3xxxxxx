Taking off where last year's Enteng Kabisote (The Legend of Okay Ka, Fairy Ko) ended, this year's filmic installment of the much-loved TV series of the earthling Enteng Kabisote (Vic Sotto) and his romance with his Faye (Kristine Hermosa), despite the frequent intervention of his mother-in-law Ina Magenta (Alice Dixson), Queen of fairyland Engkantasia, goes on to bigger grounds. Their family is expanding as Faye is again on the family way.

Satana (Bing Loyzaga), presumed destroyed in the last adventure, is restored alive by the continuing evil that men do. She is supported by her new set of henchmen, Drago (Victor Neri), Kidlat (Jeffrey Quizon) and Clawman (Boy Roque). When conflicts arise, Enteng and the rest of the family including children, Aiza (Aiza Seguerra), Benok (Oyo Boy Sotto), Ina Magenta plus her two sisters join the fight against Satana.
