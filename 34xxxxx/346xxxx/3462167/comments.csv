,Weymaster,2006-08-22T12:57Z,"I think the info is just alright.

Thanks a lot for the upload."
,the_poisoner,2006-09-06T15:21Z,"you don't have to read it!, at least you thanked him - hells teeth..."
,Abbadon45,2007-03-14T10:58Z,"Information is only useless if you know it all. I have been using DOpus on my amigas for about fifteen years, and the info was still helpfull. Thanks bogusbill for the torrent."
,miffospliffo,2007-03-31T22:53Z,"It's better information than many torrents in here. I like that people write just a little of what the torrent includes, that helps saving alot of time when you're searching for a program that can perform certain actions. If I want to google for a certain program I have to go trought all the mess in google, before I find a name I can search for in here, and it isn't sure you can find it here. So the informations makes it easier for the searching to find certain hint words in the text. It's actually a really good idea that people do that. Also If you want to get a movie 700 mb or a gb is quiete a waste of bandwidth to download if it's poor quality. Just some basic information if it's a dvdrip or a campod is quite helpfull. Besides that, How difficult is it to install a program or a basic crack, are you stupid or something? :p"

""C:\WINDOWS\system32\drivers\etc""
past this line
""127.0.0.1	www.gpsoftware.com.au""
under this line
