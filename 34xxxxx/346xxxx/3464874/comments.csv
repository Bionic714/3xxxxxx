,semen stains,2006-04-02T04:03Z,This works fine (so far) NO CRACK NEEDED
,semen stains,2006-04-04T00:24Z,"Definately YES & YES!! 
Mount the game image & install the game without using any crack(s). Mount this MDF in the same drive and you're GOOD 2 GO.
If when installing the game you suffer a nonsensical DirectX message claiming that you don't have 9c when you CERTAINLY do, you will need to edit the DirectX line in autorun.cfg file(AutoRun folder) by replacing 9 with 0. Then continue as above."
,zkinny,2006-04-10T20:48Z,Does this fix the not-getting-out.of.car prob too? And the mouse problem?
,oldermand,2006-04-12T16:24Z,Im not really much into downloading torrents and stuff... Can you tell me if i have to burn it down to a cd/DvD??
,semen stains,2006-04-17T15:32Z,"This does work perfectly, you CAN get out of the CAR, the MOUSE is NOT inverted and you do NOT need to BURN to a disc to play it. Use Alcohol or Daemon Tools & thank MACIORA"
,Weldon,2006-05-03T12:45Z,Why can't I see anything when I use daemon tool and press the mount button there are'nt any images to mount only when I press all file the Image is there and where do I start the game from?????
,tonton mis,2006-05-03T17:35Z,"Hi there 
I did download the
TheGodfatherTheGamev1.0MaxiMiniBackupImageEng.rar

But could not mount it as it is not recognized nether by daemon tool 4.03 nor  Alcohl 120% Please Help or advise. "
,semen stains,2006-05-06T01:26Z,"The image file(s) are inside the rar file. You extract them with WinRAR and then mount them. 
I do understand that its easy to get more frustrated particularly if you're desperate to play, but please try to be more precise with your question(s), especially if this response does'nt help you."

,Mikkel_89,2006-05-11T00:43Z,"hey...

,Mikkel_89,2006-05-11T00:44Z,"P.S.

I'm using Daemon tools"
,bssbss,2006-05-13T20:41Z,"I am really new to this so i need some help. First i downloaded the game. burn it to a DVD install it. When i noe mount this mdf file whit Daemon and attemt to start the game it keeps asking me to insert the correct DVD. This is probely because i installed the game from drive ""d"" and when i mount the mdf file it is in drive ""k"" How do i fix that ? so the game looks for the Cd in the Drive K instead in the drive D where it was installed from ?"
,myllys35,2006-05-17T14:05Z,I have mounted the image file but when I try to install the game it says that i don't have directx 9.0c but I do. Could anyone please help me with this problem?
