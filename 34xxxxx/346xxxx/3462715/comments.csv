Graphics...GARBAGE.

Overall Game Play...GARBAGE.
DO NOT waste bandwidth on this junk. It should already be in the bargain basket at Walmart for $3.99. I'll give it a negative 5 out of 5 stars. This would have been impressive only if it was for Super Nintendo. Probably built on the original Doom 3D engine.
Be cool. Stay in school."
,djnixtre,2006-04-04T02:02Z,"Oh sorry, no disrespect intended to the up, but next time...lets see a decent game. At least I didn't have to waste money renting or buying this junk. Cheers."
,shithot,2006-04-05T01:34Z,"I agree with the above, played it for almost 5 minutes.  Worst driving game I've ever had.  At least it didn't cost me any money to find out that it sucks.  If I had paid money for this I'd be pissed."
