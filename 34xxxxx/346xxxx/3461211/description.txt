Elle Woods (Reese Witherspoon) is a natural blonde. She dates Warner (Matthew Davis), the cutest guy on campus, and wants nothing more than to be his wife. But, there's just one thing stopping Warner from popping the question: Elle is too blonde. When Warner packs up for Harvard Law and reunites with an old sweetheart from prep school, Elle rallies all her resources and gets into Harvard, determined to win him back. But law school is a far cry from the comforts of her poolside and the mall. Elle must wage the battle of her life, for her guy, for herself and for all the blondes who suffer endless indignities everyday.
