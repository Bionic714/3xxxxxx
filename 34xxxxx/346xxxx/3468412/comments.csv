,conexn,2006-04-09T01:33Z,This is the same as all the other uploads just did not put all the information the other put. Burn and tested using Nero 7. Enjoy. Disk 4 to come in a few Min's.
[V],firbie,2006-04-09T01:35Z,rhank you. Hope they have Dutch subtitles too.
[V],firbie,2006-04-09T01:56Z,why does it not seed?
,Toy,2006-04-09T02:13Z,"This one says NTSC, the others are PAL. Just wondering which it is since you wrote 'This is the same as all the other uploads...'?
Thank for sharing either way! :)"
,conexn,2006-04-09T02:20Z,"Other that the PAL it should be the same. Ripped the disks the way I was told to do it. As far as the Dutch Subs I do not know... Was ripped using DVD Shrink 3.2, also did a deap scan of the disk for maxium quality..."
[V],firbie,2006-04-09T02:27Z,I do not mind the delay though. But since you burned it and tested it you can see if they have subtitles or not. Thanks anyway for uploading.
,conexn,2006-04-09T03:36Z,Sorry to say the only subtitle is English. It is also the only one on the orignal as well.
,boeleke,2006-04-09T08:49Z,"Because it is not PAL and no other subs then English I'll wait for BrenneBjarne.
thanks anyway !!"
,QllQ,2006-04-09T08:59Z,"Sam here, not the same at all, appreciate the effort though."
,QllQ,2006-04-09T09:38Z,"Sounds like BrenneBjarne wont be upping anymore discs:

,Mopper,2006-04-09T12:50Z,"Have to ask , cause I can't find it ... Where can I find the torrent for voyager S4 D7 ?"
,KnightDiver,2006-04-10T10:31Z,"Am I the only one stuck at about 1%?  Or is there a problem with the seed?  Not complaining, just wondering if it's my problem."
,Raggarn_76,2006-04-10T19:49Z, I have the same problem 1%
,conexn,2006-04-11T09:03Z,"Ok, I am now seeding this torrent with a DSL connection as well as a cable, this should solve any problems with uploading... Enjoy"
