,lastjedi,2009-09-22T11:22Z,"penthouse was pretty weak from 70-89 they got really good in the late 90's when they started showing full penetration and lips wrapped around a cock,they stopped showing that for someone reason now,they  only show lesbian girls now no more man and woman sex in their magazine."
