The quality is absolutely amazing. But when I play it, it tends to ""jump"" a little. What's that about? Has it something to do with my VLC player, perhaps?"
,scarsam,2006-06-27T15:35Z,"Play it in a dvd proram like ""power dvd"" then it will work :) 

The show is fantastic and the girls is allso fantastic"
,monster0129,2006-07-30T18:24Z,is this the 2005 show? how long is the runtime? is this the one broadcast by CBS? just that 5.34 GB is pretty large...
,diotav,2006-11-26T22:35Z,This is one of the best 1080-shows .. wish I had more! :)
,Nordic1,2006-12-19T07:44Z,"You will need to download a codec for TL files (not a big deal) Also note this is the show from 05, NOT 06... Otherwise this video is of very high quality with near perfect audio"
,dahulk12,2007-01-17T01:59Z,"THANK YOU FOR THIS! It looks amazing!

habbalah, I think the ""skipping"" you are talking about may be where the commercials were removed, which is a good thing! Other than that few seconds of a skip, the file plays wonderfully in latest VLC player. Looks like the actual HD broadcast on my 22' HD PC Monitor. 

Once again, THANK YOU diotav!"
