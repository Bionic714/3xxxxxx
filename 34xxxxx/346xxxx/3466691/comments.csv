,=michael=,2006-04-05T11:12Z,no he isnt wrong look at the files!!!
[T],DasBot,2006-04-05T17:11Z,Perhaps right category. But I don't know if it should be called a movie. Maybe some of the other video categories is more correct. Too many people put their video clips and so on in the movie category.
,heathman001,2006-04-05T18:02Z,This is the only section that allows the entry of spoken language and texted language which is why I posted it here.
,heathman001,2006-04-05T18:09Z,"Also this is the DVDR (Dvd-Rip) category and I did afterall rip it from a dvd. But if it shouldn't be posted here, where would be a better place?"
[T],DasBot,2006-04-05T18:51Z,You can always put in it another video category and write in the info text which language it has.
[T],DasBot,2006-04-05T18:52Z,"Oops, some words came out in wrong order..."
[T],DasBot,2006-04-05T18:56Z,For me a movie is something that you will always find on IMDb (www.imdb.com). I'm rather sure this one cannot be found...
