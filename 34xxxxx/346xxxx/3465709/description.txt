Now what i do know that i do not have is the Loose Leaves cd, so if anyone has it, please send me a link to the torrent and seed it. I also have Conor Oberst's first two cds, water and Here's To Special Treatment. I will start a torrent for these. I am also looking for the desaparecido's cds, and I am trying to get all of conor's cds whenever i do get these i am going to try and create a conor oberst discography and actually seed it. so if anyone can help me find those cds i would be much obliged.
