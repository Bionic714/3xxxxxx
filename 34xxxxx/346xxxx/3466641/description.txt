
Riot    	
Origin: New York, NY, USA
Genres: Traditional Metal
Status: Active


Once known as the little band from New York with the odd mascot, Riot has certainly come a long way. They were unstoppable in the early eighties, with Fire Down Under still regarded as a classic, and one of the best metal albums of the eighties. Their initial run ended soon after 1983's Born In America, but guitarist Mark Reale was undaunted, moving to Texas and starting up a new version of the band. Now many lineup changes removed from that incarnation, Riot continues to thrive, enjoy successing in Europe and Japan. Though they haven't recorded since 2002, they are still an active entity and in fact a new album has been completed, though without a title or a release date.
