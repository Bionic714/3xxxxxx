,shaggy1978,2008-09-09T10:45Z,how do i play a RAR file my player will not play it any ideas????
,elscheffe,2009-02-13T11:51Z,"""I guess acting isn't enough for some people.""

He IS acting. It would simply have been impossible to have - and tremendously bizarre to watch - Phoenix and Witherspoon lip-sync to the original material. The songs are part of their text, not merely a score to the film. And funnily enough both of them actually sang very, very well. I even like Witherspoon's voice and comic demeanour more than Carter's original performance. :-)"
,elscheffe,2009-02-13T11:54Z,"shaggy, assuming your post was meant seriously: RAR is an archive format, like eg. Zip. You'll have to unpack it to get to the MP3s. You could use WinRAR for this (proprietary, get it here from the Bay) or 7-Zip (free/open source, http://www.7-zip.org/)."
,mrvain32,2009-05-31T21:28Z,Thanks a lot to seeders. And of course a special mention to the torrent maker. Greatly appreciated.
,beenbee,2009-09-28T09:11Z,Thanks! Much appreciated. I know this might be a sacrilige for JC fans but i'd rather prefer those versions to original :)
,Gugle,2009-12-06T01:39Z,"Song named ""Times a wasting"" is missing from the soundtrack. And I really like that one the most. It starts around 01:00:00 in the movie."
