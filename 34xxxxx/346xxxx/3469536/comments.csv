,GiR_2006,2006-04-13T02:27Z,"the quality is poor, for some reason there are black borders on either side and the audio is out of sync :/ It's a poor rip"
,moondance,2006-04-13T12:15Z,"Hi,
Works perfectly here. Do you have the DivX codec installed?

,GiR_2006,2006-05-01T14:01Z,"yes I do have the divx codec - it plays fine but it's just not a particularly good rip that's all. Comare it to my rip of the 1990 lord of the flies and you will see what I mean.

,codgecodge,2009-01-15T11:09Z,"Use VLC Player available here at TPB if your audio is out of sync.
Nobody that can help will ever see requests for seeders so just be patient.I have thought a torrent would die only for it to complete weeks later."
