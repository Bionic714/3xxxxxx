DVD Rips of the Jackass series. 

Ripped : Robot4Rip, Gordianknot, Divx6

Quality not amazing but most of that is because the dvd's themselves aren't very good because Jackass is filmed on small cameras etc.. The Volume 1 CD2 is actually part of the "Extra features" but it leadson so hence I named it CD2. I know the sound is very slightly out of sync on that rip, but it's also out of sync on the dvd (Tried in several drives.) All rips are 4:3 as the dvds. 

FTW?
