Daryl Smith is an idiot..."
,iceman45,2006-04-09T16:51Z,"Daryl Smith sounded kinda nutty but that other guy he was talking had some good points like how all Jones does is spread fear and helplessness without giving any suggestions on what to start DOING at a grassroots level to change things. Also I liked the sarcasm in his unautorized Jones slogan: ""The new world order is going to eat your baby"". LoL. This is some good stuff. "
