Release notes: Highly-anticipated 2nd album from one of the U.S.'s best heavy/power metal bands. On 'The Longest Night', Pharaoh unleashes a vast and adventurous album, full of bold songwriting, larger-than-life guitar and a performance that cements Tim Aymar's standing as one of the most commanding vocalists in metal. Features powerhouse guest appearances from guitar wizards Chris Poland and Jim Dofka.

Enjoy and please seed.
