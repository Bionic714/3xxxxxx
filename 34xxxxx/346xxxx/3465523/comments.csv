I'm trying to use vlc, but it keeps giving me a error (window's error so I have no clue as to what's wrong)  Any other player to use?  I've tried Realplayer and Windows media player, but I only get sound for those."
,Artano,2006-04-06T16:22Z,"I too have problems with the videos. Can't play them in VLC, Quicktime, Realplayer, Windows Media Player or any other player I have on my comp. I have all the latest updates, and I have watched several .mp4-files before..."

I used the same codec."
,idiotse,2006-04-09T16:46Z,"I had no problem playing the file with Quicktime.

Gspot says it use my ffdshow codec, so try download that codec.


thanks for the upload"
