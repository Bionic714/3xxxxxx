,giessler,2006-04-10T15:30Z,@Zonereaver Airliner Pilot isn't worth a penny! Don't waste your time and traffic :)
,slugga,2006-04-11T00:38Z,"Fspassenger will work 1 - 2 days until Dan runs hes little backdoor. Then it will fall back to $ mode with 'pls register FSpassenger'.

There IS a reason why nobody has made a working keygen or a crack for this program."
,MeToYou,2006-04-11T03:36Z,"tik68 - what the hell are you doing on a torrent site if you have an issue with it? So you wont download this but you will download PMDG's 747 because they are a bigger company? Talk about being a hypocrite....

Steal or dont - your choice - but dont come to tell us because we dont give a shit.

if its commercial.. it will find its way on here - end of story.

[T],stevekasian,2006-04-12T03:40Z,"MeToYou:  WTF are you talking about ""...then why are you downloading from a torrent site""?? WTF does a ""torrent site"" have to do with stealing or piracy? The bittorrent protocol was invented and is used for filesharing, and filesharing isn't stealing - it's SHARING.  It's nubes like you who give the RIAA, MPAA, etc. all their ammo. to go after torrent sites and shut them down. Dolt."
,MeToYou,2006-04-12T20:12Z,"Steve, shut the fuck up. Dont talk like your the only one that understands ""the scene."" 

with your comment - ""filesharing isn't stealing - it's SHARING"" Who's the fucking noob now? If your downloading something commercial and you dont own the original product - its illegal, so dont even start with that ""i'm only sharing officer.."" bullshit. I didnt say I have a problem with bittorrent or TPB for that matter. I'm happy to download and share. That doesnt make what we are doing, right. It is still illegal. My point to tik68 was if he has a conscience about downloading/sharing someones work - why is he even on TPB? Look at the majority of torrent files on TPB, do they look like freeware to you? What does tik68 think that just because its a single person making a small income that all of the FS2004 uploaders here at TPB will ignore it? Of course not. What I said to him was if its commercial, it will be on here, because people will request whether any of us like it or not.. whether its from a single developer or a large FS company. 

People like me dont give torrent sites a bad name. Where the fuck do you come up with crap like that? When you see the new daily uploads on this site, you think the MPAA and RIAA dont have enough fuel when they see their products as torrent files? Go click the ""legal"" link you dumb shit.

So next time keep your mouth shut when you dont know what we are talking about and its written n00b not nube, so who's the fucking n00b now?"
,flehalk,2006-04-12T22:51Z,"I think im not the only one who dislikes demo versions of software. They are often time restricted or feature restricted and that leave either to little time or to restricted testing to make up my mind. If i like the software in question i will purchase it, its as simple as that and i hope everyone that likes this program will do the honorable thing and purchase it."
,titiro250,2006-04-25T01:29Z,"Hello I'm Dan the author of FsPassengers, not a big company, just an individual that worked 14 month 10-12 hours per day with passion to make this program. As I'm jobless since a long time FsP is my only income for me and familly.

I thought to make this friendly protection because as customer I was pissed by complicated protection scheme and I counted on people honnesty as I'm not a big company that people accuse to be unfair to justify stealing.
I accepted the deal that some would still steal my work, I thought this number would be acceptable as most people are honnest.

But last review of some statistic showed me that at least only 1 user on 26 have bought FsP and thought that my work deserved some rewards. (this doesn't take in account p2p but only download numbers on site as yours vs purchase number)

As I can't live from fresh air if this continue there will probably never be another version of FsPassengers.

Not a menace just fact: When cash is over and if only a few pay you can't continue to work for almost free.

I personnaly think that one can't yell after big company and after this more and more secure
world and never pay independants authors and alternate solution.

If you consider I have done a good work and an enjoyable software, please consider rewarding my work.

Thanks,

Dan"
,_Seth_,2006-04-27T09:15Z,"I downloaded it, tried it, bought it. All respect to author, for doing a great job, he deserves every dollar earned on this exellent program."
,NTL1991,2006-06-26T00:20Z,"With all do respect Dan, I think that $39 for this software is a little much. If the software title was $19.99, then I would absolutely buy it... It is a very good piece of software though.

,fabula,2006-06-29T20:42Z,"Thanks.

@Dan.: I would like to buy, but I am still a poor tudent, hardly with equipment to fly. (recently changed my old crppy joy for SL BlackWidow)
But you can be assured that this would be the first product to buy."
,pirate4life2,2007-01-06T20:06Z,"WOOT works, 39.99 is to much for this program."

,padsquad43,2008-08-15T09:06Z,"oh for the love of god seedd.  

and dan, your product is great and all, but it's expensive. small company or big, the average consumer doesn't wanna pay $54749 for addons for a game that costs a good 50 to begin with. "
