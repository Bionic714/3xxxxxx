Content posted to usenet stays alive at least THREE YEARS and does not rely on greedy imbeciles or whining f--cktards to provide bandwidth

The VERY people using BitTorrent are destroying it; no help required by ""government"" or other fascists.

Combine usenet with netflix or similar.   

(people who have completed NEVER see this pathetic whining)
