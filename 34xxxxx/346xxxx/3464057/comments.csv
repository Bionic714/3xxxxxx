,daytriper,2006-07-01T01:08Z,"ummmmm, to the best of my knowledge Chris Hannah is still the frontman of propagandhi, Portage terriers are  a fine junior hockey team, but Chris still sing's and writes for prop."

,NeverTheSame,2009-02-12T21:27Z,"Actually, I Spy are one of the best Canadian hardcore bands I've ever heard. And the singer of I Spy has been the bassist and second vocalist of Propagandhi since Today's Empires, Tomorrow's Ashes, so in a sense, this is entirely Propagandhi."
