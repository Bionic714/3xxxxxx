,spaceace,2006-03-21T05:30Z,please seed....
,JLJ27,2006-03-21T07:27Z,This is my first torrent and I haven't found out what I'm doing wrong now that I've gotten this far...but I'll keep trying.
,spaceace,2006-03-21T12:11Z,just  start the torrentfile and save to the same direction were you keep the actual files. Then it should start seeding.
,JLJ27,2006-03-21T18:19Z,Spaceace...you solved the problem. Cheers!
,spaceace,2006-03-21T21:03Z,No problems. Thanks for this torrent and the other Cinderella torrent you upload...
,cdiver,2006-03-28T23:27Z,"Not much to see here.quality is not good...bummer :(

Thanks for uplading it anyhow."
,JLJ27,2006-03-29T18:52Z,Well it is from an old videotape I've had for years and probably copied one or two times plus the show is filmed with a handycam back in 1985. For a die hard fan it will surely be appreciated.
