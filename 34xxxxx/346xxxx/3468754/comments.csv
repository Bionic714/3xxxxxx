Also, you will not able to find support for this for awhile, our site is down for reconstruction. thanks"
,iseechicken,2006-04-10T01:35Z,"well you can find some support over our IRC channel atm if something comes up.

I get the bloody invalid cd key message 49 times out of 50 when I try to join any freaking server! I cannot begin to say how frustrating that is when apparently NOONE ELSE has that problem!! It's supposed to reassign you a different cd key, but if practically anyone else is already on a server it just gives me that message over and over :(

Also I never get a response in the chat channels, despite being polite and concise. And the forums are down, so that's zero support :(

I need to find some other private server listing or something >_"

Hopefully I can get to play soon!"
,Scribblette,2006-04-12T02:06Z,"no luck. Looks like I'm the only one with this issue, though, so good luck to the rest of you :)"
