A collection of 10 Windows applications I collected together into a rar file which makes your computer run a lot more efficiently. You may or may not have some of these already. Here's the list:



Google Web Accelerator

Routes your connection through the google servers which in turn speeds up your internet web browsing. It really works!


Intelli Hyperspeed 2005 v1.81

Analyses and optimizes your computer performance by changing various settings, depending upon the criteria you give it; ie: games machine, webserver, technical computing, etc.



Daemon Tools

Can be invaluable for many downloaded images you need to mount in a virtual drive. Plus a few other things. You either have this already so aren't reading this, or don't have it so should go look it up on google.



BBC Ticker

Puts a bar at the top of your screen scrolling News headlines from around the world, links from the BBC News website in England.  You click on the links to go to the main webpage dealing with the story. The links are updated every 30 minutes, or to whatever you set it to.




Windows Password Expert 1.1


If you've lost your Windows Admin password, this can 100% recover it.



Fastfolders v3.30

Once installed, you can right click on anyfolder for extra information and extra options. Very handy.



Hide Ip Platinum

Minimises to the system tray. Right click to change proxy address.


Info viewer

Installs a small program that views nfo files a lot more aesthetically than some crap notepad or whatnot.


Power ISO

Handles all ISO files and can even mount them in a virtual drive without you having the need to unarchive them. So you can install things straight from the iso image.



Crack app

A file sharer along the lines of Limewire but a lot lot better. It's totally free and a lot faster. It can also be used to search specifically for cracks and other similar things - hence the name ;)


It's only 10mb.
