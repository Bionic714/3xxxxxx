*Spoiler* 

I can see why it was banned. Not because of the gore or torture only, but i think mostly by the whole theme of abortion. Americans are so conservative. "

Aside from him, the rest wasn't so bad.  Still, wish i had just grabbed the torrent instead of buying the DVD on a whim."
,S!R3,2010-03-19T23:58Z,"this movie was so incredibly horrible.. the acting (mainly from the main guy) is probably the worst ive seen. the mixed american and sometimes completely indecipherable japanese accents were really irritating. The hand on the head was also indescribably badly done. thanks for the upload though, dont get me wrong, im glad i could see it, but it was a biiiig disappointment."
,y3n007,2011-10-18T07:39Z,"I see this is episode 13, are the rest of the episodes also about this or they are all different.....just want to know in case I need to watch the other ones first to understand this one....."
