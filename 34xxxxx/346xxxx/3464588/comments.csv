My guess is that this is a way to obtain a legit serial number, wouldn't advise downloading this"
,AxlMyk,2006-04-01T22:50Z,That is not how EF installation works..  This sounds like BS to me..
,dondaddah,2006-04-02T02:27Z,"what's the verdict ? Is this a Fake, ... or does it work ?"
,eztower,2006-04-02T07:58Z,it works fine....here is where i got it from http://www.epcgaming.com/forums/filecenter/download.php?cat=cracks
,dondaddah,2006-04-02T20:56Z,... Thank you Leki.
,TorbeTorbe,2006-04-04T19:20Z,"Doesn't work, gets as far as logging onto server then states that you are playing with a non standard version. I believe you have to use this on cracked servers only..."
,eztower,2006-04-07T10:48Z,"@TorbeTorbe

you have gone wrong somewhere installing euro force or the patch. it works fine for me even on ranked servers."
,philatio,2006-04-08T16:55Z,doesn't work without an original BF2 disc. Keeps asking for disc. Copy won't work.
,eztower,2006-04-10T17:40Z,use a bf2 mini image then
,djloco81,2006-04-21T03:05Z,"after installing this 1.22 update. and now it keeps saying, Invalid CD Key, and i've got a cd-changer and tried to change it."
,djloco81,2006-04-21T03:05Z,"ooh Yea, so what can i do about that???!!!???!!!"
,Clown029,2006-04-23T01:37Z,"I can connect to rank servers and join them, but then i get kicked for PB violation (GAMEHACK) #80155, so this crack is actually useless"
,frost bite,2006-05-10T08:56Z,"The cracks works fine for me, thanks.

djloco81: Uninstall and reinstall, add the 1.22 patch then the crack."
,icab,2006-05-13T05:20Z,"Same thing for me.  I join ranked servers, but after a few minutes, PB kicks me and bans me for 2 minutes for:

(GAMEHACK) #80155

They must have updated PB since this came out.  (ala America's Army style, PB constantly being updated)"
,eztower,2006-05-16T14:03Z,yep punkbuster has now been updated to check the bf2.exe file so you can only play on servers not running punkbuster.

Hello,

I've the same pb than philatio.
I installed, BF2, then the patch 1.22, then Euro Force, and then your crack.
But i asks to put an original disk of BF2.
What did you want to say by using a BF2 mini image ?
Because it still doesn't work with an image mounted with alcohol for example

any suggestion ?"
,Gsig,2006-05-18T17:19Z,"edit : 

IT asks to put an original disk, not me, of course !"
,Olsson92,2006-06-27T23:41Z,"Asså.. ja har laddat ner de (typ i 5-8h) I FÖRJÄVES!

det kommer till 25% sedan så står det: Uppdatering

misslyckad... Det har hänt på 5 olika patcher... och sen kan ja inte köra = Ominstalera skiten.."
