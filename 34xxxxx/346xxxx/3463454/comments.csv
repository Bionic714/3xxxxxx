Big Bowl Brown, and anyone else...if you have it and it isnt on my list, just upload it and i'll get it.

,Axecaster,2006-03-29T08:14Z,"If you can, post #200 Midway Arcade Treasures 2, as the one on here already was incomplete in some way; black screen at boot, etc...and I didn't burn it wrong or anything because it was done the same way as the RLT releases, which worked fine.    

or if anyone has that 'trilogy' disc that has MK 1-3 on it...

these would be much appreciated:

#327 Time Splitters Future Perfect 

#299 Street Fighter Anniversary 

#41   Brothers In Arms - Earned In Blood

#50   Capcom Classics Collection"
