,alienjesus,2008-10-17T01:42Z,"Interesting stuff, but the interviewer sucks at getting people to talk.  Actually he acts kind of retarded, and you can tell it pisses off some of the people."
,otthau,2009-01-04T19:14Z,"Quote from wikipedia:
It is much to the credit of this film that the investigation into the death of Christopher Wallace AKA The Notorious B.I.G. has since been reopened.

,DaJungleChemist,2010-01-06T06:57Z,"this documentary contains some rare footage and pictures. however, the narrator does a very poor job over-all of getting information from his subjects. there are many scenes which lead no-where. likewise the footage of the people who knew biggie and 2pac that was used does  them little justice. The background music used, and the fact that these stories are so ingrained in our culture; were the only things that kept my attention away from the mediocre editing and poor commentary. The point is this: Making money off of people's death is fucked up. ..I believe that this was the director/narrator's main purpose, 5 years after the whole ordeal... there are plenty of books and documentaries,  that were done right after tupac's death, and right after biggie's death. this is not one of them."
,DaJungleChemist,2010-01-06T08:18Z,"sure, maybe i was a little harsh. this documentary isn't pure shit, just mostly shit. among the many other things i was dissapointed by was the narrator using a strange form of ambush journalism and was continuously failing to introduce himself properly the whole film. during the lengthy awkward moments is when i questioned the pointed of this whole film the most (and when i wrote the first comment). proving a point? or just a sniveling producer trying to make a buck? you decide. the narrator seems to only want to prove that suge was responsible. granted; that's a great point which still needs to be looked into. but... my first comment stands. peace to biggie and peace to pac. your memories will live on no matter what people do with your stories and the music you left behind."
,DaJungleChemist,2010-01-06T08:20Z,..questioned the point* lol
,Ivannia,2011-05-01T00:41Z,"Honestly, I understand the intention of this documentary.. But I have to say that this is the worst pice of shit I've seen in a while, mostly due to the poor editing and the utterly worthless journalism behind it. This journalist's street-cred is zero to none, and his questions lack tact and make him sound quite dumb from time to time. Seriously, I also wonder if he is mentally challenged somehow.. Too bad, because as I said, the intention of this documentary was good but the execution was so poor it just pisses you off."
,zacsheep,2011-12-04T09:10Z,"yes this was not the best piece of editing and
interviewing, but it wasnt all bad, after reading the comments, i went in with low expectations, and left quite pleased (as opposed to what i now expected) qualities very good and the video overall was pretty good too. worth watching than not."
