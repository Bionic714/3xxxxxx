,DJ Smiley,2006-03-23T13:04Z,"Isn't 373 MB a little small, since the original has the size 709 MB?"
,Doc.Zinit,2006-03-23T14:04Z,"creating the image file (dmg) automatically packed it, if you mount the image, the image got over 700 mb"
,Doc.Zinit,2006-03-23T14:10Z,"sorry just checked it, it´s 615 mb at all, but I ripped it from the original cd, also I tried the image and it´s working! if you got me a hint how to rise the upload rate it would be helpfull, I set it to maximum, but the tomato torrent don´t give maximum...weird"
,Doc.Zinit,2006-03-23T16:05Z,"it´s not a game, it´s just an add on for postal 2. but for everyone: you wanna download fast? so please anyone tell me a better prog than tomato torrent, tomato gives 1kb/sek per peer, but that´s not enough, got lot more speed to give"
,mik6969,2006-03-27T13:42Z,Thanx - works great but I´m stuck in the big room after getting that gold record and killing the guy.. How do I get out? I cannot find any walkthroughs for this game on the net..
,orpheus,2006-03-28T15:57Z,"is this a good Expansion? for the game have you played it yet and stuf.
"
,Doc.Zinit,2006-03-28T19:02Z,"it´s a cool add on, but if you played through postal2 you know the cool thing was to walk around in the whole city. the expansion pack is very mission oriented. but the new weapons are cool, also the black humor continues with more cool stuff."
,mik6969,2006-04-02T08:50Z,Okay okay I really like this stuff - Thanks a lot Doc!!!! But can anyone help me to get out of this room with the big plants and the valves with money after getting the golden cd. I killed the boss but the door wont open... What do I do...????
,Erkki10000,2006-04-02T14:36Z,How to mount the image tell me plzzzz! and tell me what program i have to use?
,medo13i,2006-04-06T02:14Z,Anybody knows where to get postal 2 linux? or just linux binaries will do. thanks in advance.
,mik6969,2006-04-08T18:04Z,Okay I give up this shitty game now. I got stuck in the  publishers office complex after getting the goldmaster cd and killing that guy. its raining dollars from rhe roof but that does not help me. I´m going to throw this game out now. FUCK!!!!!
[V],operaman,2006-04-10T21:49Z,I support the request for a Linux Postal2STP release.
,Doc.Zinit,2006-04-11T13:51Z,"Sorry, but RWS only released the expansion pack as hybrid CD, the game itself is sold seperately for every system, so you got to ask Linux users :-("
,Sparrius,2006-04-12T14:39Z,How are you supposed to run this download on a PC? This dmg file is not recognized by alcohol or nero or any other program. And it does not work to convert it with dmg2iso either...leaves me with a corrupted file...what to do?
,mik6969,2006-04-20T10:58Z,Hello again! Well it was some kind of bug in that room - if you kill the boss after getting the golden cd and you cant get out - you may have to do the chapter over again. I finally did that and the game just continues after that!!
,mik6969,2006-04-23T15:03Z,"I played the whole game now and the boss at the end was a really hard ball to crack, dont you think? After that it was just a short sekvence of dude saying that he´s not regretting anything.. Not very rewarding, hey!?"
,mik6969,2006-04-23T15:04Z,"""it´s a cool add on, but if you played through postal2 you know the cool thing was to walk around in the whole city. the expansion pack is very mission oriented. but the new weapons are cool, also the black humor continues with more cool stuff."" Exactly what I think!"
[V],operaman,2006-05-25T16:49Z,"To those having troubles opening this file:
DMG is the mac disk image format. dmg2iso og Ultraiso will open it."
,rindoze,2006-08-13T02:26Z,If you got windows you can make this work by dowloading a program called MagicIso. After you install this right click on the dmg image file and go to magic iso -> extract. Then simply go to the folder created and double click the setup icon.
,Nagathus,2006-08-21T19:06Z,plz seed!
,Mr.Spade,2006-09-16T17:07Z,"Hey , I have postal 2 and it works pretty well , and when i tried to install apocalypse Weekend The set up would just say to me to Reinstall postal 2 becuse there was some important files missing . The game works perfectly :S. But i just cant install apocalypse weekend .

,iw2155,2006-11-22T03:08Z,"If you're stuck in the publishers office after fighting the guy for the gold master, open the console.  (~ on my keyboard) and type ""causeevent endmovie"" - should get the game working fine.  As for the final boss, I've heard that you have to shoot him in the head(s).  I haven't made it that far though, so don't quote me on that."
,RaptorTeeth,2006-11-29T19:18Z,How are you supposed to kill the final boss ?

WTF it is there all redy!!!"
,dzsud,2007-05-30T20:21Z,"Whit is this ""dmg file""? "
,marilyngenghis,2007-06-24T05:59Z,"dmg is a Mac disk image.
To get this to work for Windows you need two programs to convert to a Windows compatible disk image.
1.  dmg2iso
2.  MacDrive  (need v6 for win2k, try emule or newsgroups. Site only has v7 trial for download which, I think, is XP only).

Put the dmg file and dmg2iso.exe in the same place. For example, put them both on the root of C: drive.
Open a command window (or use Start>Run) and type this (I renamed the dmg to 1.dmg for this example and to save typing):

dmg2iso.exe 1.dmg 1.iso

It will take a couple minutes and create an iso of 614MB which no Windows disk image program will recognise (Alcohol etc.)
Install MacDrive (Mac drive emulator for Windows PC's).
Now you can mount the iso to a virtual drive.
(It works. It mounted and the install window for Postal came up).
You can then create an iso of this mounted image with your favorite image software (I used Alcohol).
Then you will have a Windows compatible iso that you can burn to CD.
Hope that helps.
(I've just done all the above myself as I'm on Windows PC. It took some searching to find the info. I haven't actually installed the expansion pack yet as I don't have Postal 2 installed but I'm about to try it).

"
,marilyngenghis,2007-07-01T02:27Z,"UPDATE to the above Windows ISO creation instructions!!
It's all good until I said:
""You can then create an iso of this mounted image with your favorite image software (I used Alcohol).
Then you will have a Windows compatible iso that you can burn to CD.""
Wrong!
You'll end up with an iso/CD that can only be used while MacDrive is installed (I found out after uninstalling MacDrive when I was finished).
Do this instead:
When you have the ISO mounted (with MacDrive installed), copy all the files to a folder on your harddrive. There are 4 files on the root of the CD that you don't need: 2 are hidden files and are called Desktop DB and something else (small files containing very little and probably user files from the person who made the Mac dmg. Make sure you have 'Show hidden files and folders' checked in Windows Tools>Folder Options>View). The other 2 relate to Linux and MacOS installs. Delete these 4 files. Uninstall MacDrive (requires a reboot) and then just burn all the contents of the folder to a CD with whatever burning software you use.
Works. I now have an instal CD for AW that works fine without MacDrive installed."
,Mixzeo,2007-07-15T21:44Z,"just download program like ultraiso and open the file whit that, that extract the files that are in the dmg file to your computer and just open the setup file... simple as that!!!"
