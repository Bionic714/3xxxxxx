AMG Review :
Green Jelly was still called Green Jello when Cereal Killer Soundtrack was
released in 1993, but when the makers of Jello objected to the name and the band
faced legal action, a name change proved necessary. Comparable to Gwar but
exhibiting a goofy personality of its own, the former "video only" outfit takes
itself about as seriously as Spinal Tap on its first audio release. There's
nothing even remotely serious about this album -- from start to finish, this is
obviously a parody of heavy and thrash metal and alternative rock. A few of the
songs sink under the weight of Jelly's self-indulgence, but at its best, the
band can be wildly entertaining. Cereal's standout track is the nutty metal/rap
hit "Three Little Pigs," and almost as much fun are "Electric Harley House (Of
Love)" (Jelly's parody of Motorhead), "Obey the Cowgod," and a cover of the Sex
Pistols' "Anarchy In the U.K."

Pointless Technical Details:
Ripped on Linux with cdparanoia III 9.8, encoded with standard FLAC 1.1.0 at
full compression.

Additional Notes:
The CD this was ripped from uses "Green Jello" rather than "Green Jelly",
i.e. it was before they were forced to change (see review above). I'm not sure
how much, if at all, the tracks themselves changed with the name change.
The JPEG cover art says "Jelly" because it's all that I could find.
