,michap,2006-03-26T10:47Z,"No, no subs."
,michap,2006-03-26T18:45Z,"Come on people... Keep seeding after you download, at least for a day. That's not too much to ask, is it?"
,harryhaffa,2006-03-28T00:50Z,Kvaliten på denna är skit fattar inte varför man gör om till divx när det inte går att se utan att få ont i huvet.
,michap,2006-03-29T13:31Z,"Yeah, I said the quality was varying.. I don't know who did it, and I don't know why the are so bad. I've downloaded them my self from different sources on the net. If I had had the dvd's (if dvd's even exist) I could have offerd you something a lot better.. To me it looks like something someone recorded from tv or vhs. 
Still, at least I can enjoy the atistic qualitys of Mr. Adder and his ""friends"". :-D"
,kukilon,2006-09-20T14:18Z,"Thanks a lot! 

Why do people whine about the quality when he already stated that the quality varies but it's rather whatcable?   "
,gebhi,2006-12-01T04:01Z,"Quality of this complete seasons but audio is out of sync and some episodes tend to stick and crash media player.

Rather dissapointing!"

,PontiacJunkie,2007-08-15T05:14Z,"The first season is a little grainy, even on DVD"
