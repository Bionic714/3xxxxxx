"War in Iraq: Why DO They Hate Us?"

DVD Compilation with interactive menu's

1) "Soundtrak To War". A documentary by George Gittes. Very hard to get. Alot of this footage ended up in Michael Moores 'Farenhight 9-11". George Gittes is a gung Ho Oz journalist who is famous in Iraq. Here he asks simple questions of Iraqi and American forces on their favoruite music. Sometimes touching. Especially the balding Bee Gee's of Bahgdad who do a perfect rendition of "New York Mining Disaster".

2) "Iraq". A German production. Follows the 82nd Airbourne around Baghdad as it shoots anything that moves. Distressing. English subtitles.

3) "Apche Hit". A more revealing look at that Apache gunship video of the guys in the field. They are definately insurgents...who wont be going home for dinner. There is an even longer version where we see clearly RPG's and AK 47's. The anti war movement edited it to look like they were innocent farmers...very underhanded!

4) "Marine Murder". Footage of marines killing an Iraqi man on the ground. Callous murder in full view of CNN. I do not know the circumstances surrounding this.

5)'Tank Crush". Footage of Iraqi's having their car crushed by a 57 ton Abrams tank. They were looting wood so they deserved it...God help them if they had looted matches too. So why are you hated their America?

6) "Merc Snipers". Footage taken by gung ho mercs in Najaf in 2004. We see them 'smokin' bad guys from 800 meters. Hoo haa! These are "Blackwater" mercs who like to shoot Iraqi car drivers to Elvis Music. 

I put the excellent new song and music video by 'The Living End' in the background to the main menu. It's called "Wake UP". Excellent song for the times in the spirit of Pink Floyd and "The Wall".
