Just using space meant for use gamers and the like to comment on the files.
Dude if we wanna play poker we'll just use our Championship Poker 2 .iso backup and boot that puppy on the 1.5
Better to play a PSP game then throw away your hard earmed money in a virtual casino, lol
Thanks to Turbo Warrants for the files!!!"

,kraziaznvtboi,2011-07-31T01:37Z,"Before you even download this, save your time by:

1.  Learning what CFW is.
2.  Learning how to unpack archives.

Once you do that and have a CFW on your PSP, come back here and ask for help.  But please don't waste yours and our time by asking how to use this on an unmodded PSP or what to do with the archived files."

,FuknFukr,2012-02-09T01:54Z,I have CFW 6.60 PRO-B9. I do not have the option of unzipping the files with winrar and I've tried compressing the files into a winrar archive and boot it same as an iso. What do I do to turn these files into an iso?
,FuknFukr,2012-02-11T02:29Z,Gee Thanks for the help guys...
