could anyone tell me which one it is? thanks for telling me and thanks for uploading"
,Najky,2006-04-05T22:02Z,Ofcourse it is arab if it is an arab movie. Dubbing is wrong!
,Nagi,2006-04-08T13:47Z,"It doesn't say there's English audio in the description. It says it's Arabic audio and Danish and English subtitles. That's how I understand the description, at least. Thanks for the post!"

,Evil__Homer,2007-01-16T07:44Z,"It does clearly say Spoken Language(s): English

A mistake by the uploader, which is corrected in his/her own description underneath."
