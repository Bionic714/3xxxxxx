,DunnyBasher,2007-06-01T13:15Z,"I believe .daa is one of PowerISO's formats. Search around, there's a million torrents of it."

,stupid m0nkey,2007-07-13T11:06Z,"DON'T DOWNLOAD, norton is a bullshit virus protector"

,sirjason,2007-10-16T06:59Z,"Hello Folks,
  I am downloading this torrent to see if it is what is is said to be. STUPID MONKEY has chosen a good name for himself, however I think ignorant monkey would have been more acurate. Listen Dumb Ass? We don't want your fucking opinion about Norton. If we wanted McAfee or another antivirus, we wouldn't be looking for a good version of Norton that is cracked or has a keygen with it. We have already decided that we want norton or wouldn't be here looking for it. You are to tell us if it is not norton or if it has a virus. You are like so many people who use PCs and have no clue what you are doing. Many people like you who want to know alot about a PC, but are to shallow minded to learn no matter how long it takes. Try to learn more before you decide what is good for your life and what is bad. I bet you make alot of fucked up choices that effect you and others around you who care about you. Listen again and take it from someone who learned about Computers himself before going to College and receiving a degree in Computer Systems Technology. There is no better or more trusted technology than Norton. Our Government and Largest Companies including Microsoft Corporation Depend on Norton to Protect billions of dollars. If Norton didn't protect them from Hackers they could loose alot. The question is not whether Norton is Good Or Not. Norton has one hell of a reputation. The only question that anyone reading this has would be, Is it what it says and does it cantain a threat to our PCs? No one wants to know what your favorite Program is or what fucking color you like. Fuck you. We will decide what we like. So go suck on momma's titty some more until you graduate from what ever you are doing with your life. If you can hang with the big dogs, Stay on the poarch! If anyone has any questions about your PC then you can Email or IM me AT lovebirdsdownsouth@hotmail.com and I will be glad to help you free of charge. My intention is to make the world a better place. Jason"
,sirjason,2007-10-16T07:10Z,"PS I know I misspelled some words in my fit of rage. I knew someone would be a smart ass if I didn't make that correction. Please people, Get the facts before you listen to one persons opinion.The reason many people don't like Norton is because it is hard to get cracked or a good key for it because it is a security tool and is built not to be hacked. That meens if you can't crack it, noone can hack your PC with it installed. If I paid someone to protect me I would choose someone who's ass my enemy can't beat. Isn't that the purpose of security? Damn why are people so shallow minded? Does this make sense? Maybe I am the one who is fucked up. Give me some feed back?"
,sirjason,2007-10-17T01:38Z,"Now if you need more information on Norton 360 which is the best in my opinion. Notice I stressed my opinion? You may feel different. There are more Kegen/Cracks for it because it is so much more popular. It also, Contrary to what you may have read by at least one dumbass on this page, It is very light for your Operating System compared to earlier versions. To learn more about it and how to crack it here is the address. http://www.raymond.cc/blog/archives/2007/04/02/finally-norton-antivirus-2007-deserves-a-key-generator/                     Your friend,
                                     Jason"

,Attte,2008-02-26T20:37Z,Not working on Windows Vista Home Basic (legal). Error on setup.
,JusticeItself,2008-03-04T12:19Z,"Thanks for NIS 2007! After many tests and with my 10 years old expierience in IT, I can say it's graet stuff. BUT! The common thing that users do is they base on firewall saying ""I've installled it, what do I care anymore?"" Bullshit! You are Administrator of your machine, protect it and take care of it and of your protecting software if you want it to work prefectly, this kind of software is a tool and as you know, the tools aren't perpetum mobile, they need someone to watch them from time to time.
Anyway, THANKS for NIS 2007 quer659 :)"
,da9eldassdraug,2008-03-13T10:55Z,"very nice man, thank you for a great working torrent! :D

,Crim2k8,2008-03-15T03:54Z,"When you guys say it's not working for Vista, is that 32 or 64 bit?  Norton has known problems with 64."
,dvlchlddlx,2008-03-15T21:44Z,"uninstall any norton product then install this version. FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS!! the keygen does work. as stated, do not register the product. enjoy up to 11 years of norton!! btw, LIVE UPDATE still work to keep 2007 up to date."
,kewlhand,2008-03-24T16:28Z,"As at 23/03/2008 none of the generated keys seem to work, they are accepted by the program but rejected at final 'product activation' stage."
,wiggy2k7,2008-03-28T01:24Z,"kewlhand - 

Must be your PC cause it still works fine on mine"
,agtait001,2008-03-30T06:46Z,"hey all, firstly, great stuff for this download, it does work, and please to all users, READ THE INSTALLATION NOTES FIRST!!  (located in the crack folder)

Secondly, you will need PowerISO (1MB and free) to run the .DAA file.  I have installed in XP and now have 4000 days of subscription...

Brilliant work - thank you quer659"
,qroxorp,2008-04-14T00:06Z,"Nice copy!! works to 100%!! just follow the guide and you have 11 years of norton internet security!! 
Good work man!"
,Pib27,2008-04-24T13:23Z,"Hmm... Strange, my Key gen suddenly disappeared... gonna try downloading it again... Anyone else had problems like this ?"
,JDugan94,2008-04-27T22:24Z,Seed this is a good torrent.
,JDugan94,2008-04-27T22:25Z,how do you seed? hehe I'm a noob.
,agtait001,2008-05-09T06:39Z,"quer659, the NIS worked perfectly for about 30 days and now it has notified me that the subscription has expired and i need to renew it.  I have then removed NIS and all components using add+remove , cleared the registry, and tried reinstalling it, the 'click here for phone activation' will not reapear...  All i can get is 'please enter the re activation' code pop up.  Please can you help me!!  thanks "
,g8aso,2008-05-11T10:32Z,"Yes, Norton will remove the keygen, they're not stupid.

Keep it on a usb stick or something, or make a record of the serials and activation codes.
"
,dvlchlddlx,2008-06-01T19:19Z,"i have had the keygen dissapear on several torrents i have downloaded. i even copied  NIS2007 to disk and when i tried to use  the keygen, it fails, then it was gone."
,mrnapolean1,2008-06-30T19:14Z,Will this fully work on Windows Vista Home Premium SP1?
