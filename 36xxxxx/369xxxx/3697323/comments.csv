,fenris1985,2007-05-28T14:19Z,"If you have dual core CPU, go to task manager and de-select one of them for the current application and you should be set"
,orion70,2007-05-28T19:21Z,dont wake up sleeping dogs and be glad this retarded wannabe cracker stays away with his poor ripped low-budged games..

,smokeshack,2007-05-29T05:35Z,This game is hideously bad.
,lelle22,2007-05-29T13:41Z,"yeah i must agree this is one of the worst games i've played, it's pretty obvious it's a multiformat game intended for consoles, hence the steering being out of control and impossible to work with. but still, Dopeman is my favourite uploader on TPB so keep up the good work"
,espen1812,2007-05-29T18:02Z,This is one crappy game!!! 
,420dopeman,2007-05-29T21:32Z,"lol, happy I dont make em...

Need to ask though, worse then two-worlds?
I dont play RPG's and such, so Im no judge to go by on them. Can only go by what you guys state. So, always appreciate the input.

greeetz."
,theflemisch,2007-05-29T21:57Z,"Hey Dopeman, looks like som shit off hell is funny up here!

THX again for all the stuff bro!!!!"
,lelle22,2007-05-30T00:00Z,"hi there Dopeman, let's put it like this, Two Worlds isn't a Neverwinternights 2 or a Oblivion, but something with that game made me like it, but it sure as hell wasn't the gameplay or the enemies since they have AI like a rock, what im saying is this, there aren't that many good RPG's out there so even the ones that between 60-80 % in score are worth putting on TPB.. Cheers"
,420dopeman,2007-05-30T00:56Z,"ty, good to know."

does anyone passed this level? And how?

thanks"
,villemk,2007-11-13T16:09Z,"if the game is too fast then:
1. start the game.
2. minimaze it.
3. open task manager.
4. find the game in processes.
5. right-click on it and select ""set affinity"" and de-select one of the cores."

I get an error: Unable to initialize renderer: - 103

Please help?"
,reaper492,2008-06-13T23:01Z,"Unable to initialize renderer: - 103 Equals, your computer sucks and your video card can't handle the truth.  Stick to diablo superdownloader and stop your whining.  Thanks Dopeman."
,joeblack4u2,2008-06-25T03:36Z,i tried running this my screen turns black and then it says error? i must be doing somthing wrong? help
,martinio9292,2008-07-23T07:18Z,the only BAD thing about dopeman(sorry dope) is that people tend to leech alot of his torrents :/ slow download..
,pseudome,2008-09-18T05:05Z,"Cause people are dicks Superdownloader, and not helping people makes them feel superior because they don't need help themselves, or some stupid reasoning.
That or no one knows what you can do to fix it.
More likely the latter though."
,Ruostepoika,2008-09-27T17:17Z,"Seed people, seed! It's an awesome game that should be shared here, but the download is way too slow atm."
,Ruostepoika,2008-10-02T20:39Z,"Erm... I've got this funny issue i'd like to share here. It's about Conan turning red everytime he gets hit, and staying red 'till you drink a potion, orstuff like that. I just wanted to ask if anyone else is having this problem, and has an idea how to fix it."
,chajus,2009-01-19T22:11Z,"At first it didn't go but after about 7th try I've done it btw I'm using Vista Ultimate.
Thing is if freaked me a little because of a small amount of ''weight''usually it's ~3GB.
After unzipping the lot i pressed the ??T3Main?? and it had absolutely no effect my pc just stood there and was doing absolutely nothing, then I gone to read dope's readme to know what the hell's going on, inside the file he/she wrote (you will find out your self when you'll open the file-> btw this is not what he said...). Followed his/her instruction couple times with no result what's so ever. I was just about go bananas, and started to deleting the thing and noticed that it didn't let me to delete ??T3Main?? file hence it's in use. Then thought (wait a minute this may be it) turned off the t3main true the Task Manager and run it again (I made 2 copies, nearly finished deleted one) from another copy and it worked. So if anyone asks it works on Vista end of the discussion.
Sorry for long story ^^"
,chajus,2009-01-19T22:21Z,"And btw there is a cool graphical update for Thief 3 (this why I have downloaded the game to try it out ^^) I think this update may massively improve the game, my personal thought the guy have done a wonderful job
http://www.john-p.com/textures/Thief-DS/index.shtml
(installer size = 106MB)
The installation lets' you to choose what you want to change in the game and if you think that the game cannot be improved look at the picture gallery. Good Thieving"
,SamFisher440,2009-05-23T06:30Z,"Thanks Dopeman. Played 15 minutes into it and no problem. If anyone is getting an error it's either because they have integrated graphics or their card isn't supported due to them being, too new or something. I'm running it on a Geforce2 MX 200, lol.

Or maybe it's Vista. We can always blame Bill Gates for it. 

But yeah, thanks for the game. I've been playing the Xbox 360 Conan, never knew their was a 2004 game. Especially for consoles, I never seen it anywhere. "
,Dracion,2009-06-18T19:21Z,"maidenvargos is right. There is a bug in the lava
caves preventing Conan from climbing the wall.
Its pretty much the only way to complete the level.

Has this happened to anybody else?

If so, and you were able to overcome it, would you be kind enough to post it here.

I have been looking for a fix/patch that might sort the problem out but so far nothing."
,Captain_wow,2009-06-24T11:47Z,Dopeman thanx for the awesome uploads
