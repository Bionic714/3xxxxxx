Dont bother..."
,prepreden,2009-04-04T18:31Z,"An albanian saying this is serbian propaganda? Hmmm... you guys say it's serb propaganda for everything not saying that albanians are innocent and sweet as babies. I'd understand if you said this for a documentary called Stolen Kosovo (or: Kosovo, stolen, it's a Czech doc.) coz it says all worst stuff of all the albanians did, but this one? BTQ it's not a serbian documentary. But if you want to see the whole truth of Kosovo i.e. real ""State of denial"", download ""Stolen Kosovo"" (available on YT too)."

,Gugle,2009-10-07T02:23Z,"I could not say that the movie is one or another side propaganda, but the author very often incorrectly translates the statements of the people he is interviewing. This movie should not be taken as a reliable source of information."
