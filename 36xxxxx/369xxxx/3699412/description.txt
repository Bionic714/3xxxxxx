QUOTES FROM THIS DOCUMENTARY

    ?For over 2 years now and on 4 separate occasions the We The People Foundation has sponsored meetings in Washington D.C. to try to bring together in one place various tax researchers from across the nation and IRS officers in order to discuss the alarming conclusions reached by the tax researchers that there is no bona fide law that required most Americans who live in the 50 states to file and pay the so called income tax.?

    ?I?m not a former certified fraud examiner, I?m a certified fraud examiner. That?s something different than being at the IRS. I went and got..took the class and took the test and I am a certified fraud examiner and I am examining the biggest fraud this country has ever had.?

    ??because the IRS never seizes anything. They get your employer. They get the tow truck company. They get others to do their dirty work. Those are the people that you need to educate. If they come and get your car you need to tell that tow truck driver ..excuse me what do you have here..this says that you?re supposed to take my vehicle. Is this valid? Have you researched whether this is valid, sir? I would suggest you do that because if you take my car away without knowing that you know that you know that this is valid I?m gonna sue you and your company..?
