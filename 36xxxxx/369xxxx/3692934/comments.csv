,JohnnyProblemsolver,2008-09-19T04:53Z,"Dear God,
I really appreciate U are ripping too.
Ur releases are the best.
But this one isnt perfect, just as the world is today.
It wont setup proper, and if it starts u cant do nottin in the menu.
But thanx anyway, i love you and my brother billy too although he uses ur name in a wrong way, don't blame him."
,Bodicia,2008-10-04T17:13Z,"It may be of service if these torrents were a little easier to understand for we dumber peeps who don't have the brains of a retarded hanster when it comes to our anti-virus programs reporting trojens, etc? 

I'm sure Mr Dopeman doesn't have any malicious code in his excellent files he gives to us all. But obviously some of us shouldn't be left in a locked room alone with any sharp instruments, and find it all confusing.

So, in my arbutory mode, can I suggest he might like to make the opening and running of these zipped games a teeny bit clearer, and why we might get virus reports of the config.exe file?

Please feel free to comment on my assumed helpful suggestions here. :)

You WILL remain the god of Torrents! We all bow to your superior skills! XXX"
,Dopeman,2008-10-13T22:54Z,"dudes. I lost this game so had to re-download myself because I wanted to play. :)

Avast picked up config.exe as a virus for me too. IT IS NOT. I sent the file to avast zipped and passworded virus. They tested it and confirmed NOT a virus. They have since updated their virus definitions to not call it out as a virus.

POINT: NOT a virus. If you are so worried. Send it to your anti-virus company and have them test it. Just zip it and password it.

And yes, you need this file to play the game."
,Smygizz,2008-10-16T17:51Z,"If you're using antivirus programs such as NOD32, It thinks that the CONFIG.EXE is a virus and that's why those who've gotten a warning can't find CONFIG.EXE since their antivirus program removed it. It's safe to download.."

Use a decent anti-virus program that does not make false reports may i suggest Avira free?
My only gripe is that I cannot save my progress. Every time I go to save it says it can't. Maybe it's looking for the saved game path which is not created as this game is not 'installed'. So does anyone know what the default save directory would be so I can create it?"
,Theawesomeman,2012-01-05T06:57Z,i cant play it because the config.exe has a virus and it wont extract
