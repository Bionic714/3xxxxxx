,Churchills Dog,2007-05-27T13:15Z,I just reinstalled my own copy a few days ago. Still plenty of people playing online. Why EA doesn't do a sequel for at least the MP aspect is beyond me. A great game for people who find BF series a little overblown and serious.
,Patchorus,2007-05-27T16:21Z,"I agree with churchills Dog, this game has an awesome multiplayer-part which could become even greater if just EA would continue develop it. Its a shame they put that project on their shelves so quickly."
,ufa21,2007-05-30T13:44Z,"OK I DID EVERYTHING THE INSTRUCTIONS SAID TO DO BUT WHEN I TRY TO PLAY THE GAME IT SAYS INSERT CORRECT CD-ROM. I TRIED PLAYING ONLINE WITH GAMESPY AND IT SAID THE SAME THING. 
INSTALL THE GAME BY MOUNTING OR BURNING THE ISO RENEGADE A. YOU PROBABLY
WON'T NEED THE RENEGADE DATA DISK TILL YOU ARE PLAYING THE CAMPAIGN MODE. FOR
ONLINE GAMEPLAY AND TO APPLY UPDATED NO-CD CRACK. UPDATE THE GAME AFTER
INSTALLING IT USING THE RENEGADE AUTO UPDATE SHORT CUT. AFTER YOU UPDATE
IT. COPY THE NO-CD CRACK 1.037 AND YOU ARE GOOD TO GO. (ON THE LAST PART WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY COPY THE NO-CD CRACK 1.037) COULD YOU REPHRASE THAT PART FOR ME SO I COULD UNDERSTAND BETTER. I WOULD REALLY APPRECIATE IT THANKS MUCH."
,tmjam2002,2007-06-15T07:46Z,"MY friend if you wish to play online. Simply install the game. Don't start it yet. Use the Renegade auto updater to update the game. After it's updated then apply the No-CD path 1.037.

Also since most of the servers online are now Renguard protected. It's a software that prevents cheating. Servers have it so you guys need to install it on your pc to play on those servers. You can get it from www.renguard.com. 

Usually renguard applies it's own no-cd patch again and also updates the game with a new patch called Core Patch 2. Adds additional sounds and does other fixes."

,HoChiDude,2007-10-30T12:02Z,"The auto-update doesn't seem to work. It gets to where it says ""downloading file 1 of 1"" and then just closes."
,HoChiDude,2007-10-31T00:24Z,"Okay, I got it to work by finding the manual update."

,Nehuss,2007-11-18T14:21Z,HOW DO I MAKE A ONLINE ACCOUNT?it doesnt work to do one when i have made the installation.....
,blemishednicely,2007-11-22T07:58Z,"-chris_y2k_2001uk- Having the exact same issue as you did, game seems to be in for all intents & purposes, but demands cd, even when loaded in Daemon...did you ever get around this? I can't seem to figure it out...trying to get C & C: ""The First Decade"", to compensate (it's supposed to be ALL the C & C series up to it's point of release)-but I haven't finished downloading let alone seeing if THAT one is problematic. RSVP"
,blemishednicely,2007-11-22T08:02Z,"-nehuss- I don't know for sure (as I don't use it), but I hear Game Spy can sometimes give access to online play where others encounter problems...don't really play online though (antisocial I guess), so I have no personal feedback. Hope it helps, anyway..."
,blemishednicely,2007-11-22T08:15Z,"As far as this one, it looks like it's all installed, it's shown visuals, menu's I,ve even ran the auto-update, but when I try the ""no patch cd crack..."" folder it just says ""ms32.dll was not found"", tried reinstalling as it suggests an Nyet - same problem."

,blemishednicely,2007-12-04T17:41Z,"I seem to be close, but read-me or not I can't seem to get this game to work for shit...don't really want to, but I'm dumping it (can't just take up space waiting on it), if anyone figures this motherfucker out, I'd love to hear it, but not holding my breath---unless you REALLY know what you're doing, I wouldn't bother w/ this one...."
,megavikingman,2007-12-05T01:46Z,"Some older programs automatically read to the D: drive when looking for a CD.  You have to switch your virtual drive to D: somehow I think.  I can't remember how to change the built-in CD drive to a different letter, does anyone know how to do that?  I did it once when I had Daemon Tools, but I'm on a different computer now and I have Alcohol 52%.  Anyone know what I'm talking about and how to do it?"

,Slothic,2008-01-09T18:32Z,"Ok. to all the ppl who dont know what copy the crack means.  heres a step by step for 99% of games the require a no-cd-crack

Step 1. Mount the iso

Step 2. Install the game

Step 3.  Keep the Iso mounted. Then go to 
Desktop>my computer And rightclick on the drive where the iso file is mounted choose open. PLEASE NOTE! OPEN NOT AUTOPLAY ETC. JUST OPEN.

Step 4. Find a folder named: ""crack/ nocd / the uploaders name / the crackers name."" And in there should be a-.nfo file, maybe 2 .exe files or just 1. Now if this is the case congrats you found the right folder.

Step 5. Rightclick the .EXE files and click on copy.

Step 6. Go into the folder where the game is installed. (example: ""C:\Programs\Games\Noobhunter"")

Step 7. Rightclick on a white spot in the folder and click on insert or likewise.

Step 8. Click yes to all.

Step 9. Keep seeding the iso file

Step 10. Play the game.

GZ You have now copied a no-cd crack"
,Darm3n,2008-01-21T18:18Z,"Ok, I have this game all downloaded, works on xp and all, now I'm trying to get it to work on windows 98.  I tried burning it, couldn't get it to work, and I can't find a program for win98 to make a virtual drive on which to mount the image.  So what should I do?"

TO PLAY ONLINE GET CORE PATCH 2. GOOGLE CORE PATCH 2. DOWNLOAD AND UPDATE YOUR GAME WITH IT. IT HAS NEW MAPS TOO.

ALSO FOR RENGUARD SERVERS GET RENGUARD. 

THE CD KEY MIGHT BE BANNED FROM A FEW SERVERS SO FIND A KEYGEN ON KEYGEN DOT NET ;-). THEY HAVE IT AND IT ROCKS."

,haggard666,2008-11-26T23:34Z,"Ok to clarify yes i read the readme file..
I run vista home

I installed the game fine

I patched the game fine

I copied the crack game.exe file and replaced the original game file

my problem is.. when i got to run the game when that .exe file is in there a black box pops up for like a second and then nothing happens...

very disapointing 

I even tried changing my virtual drive to letter D
and using it with out the cd crack and it does not work can anyone explain the black window what it does why the program does nothing after it disapears? 

and suggestions would be great thanks"
