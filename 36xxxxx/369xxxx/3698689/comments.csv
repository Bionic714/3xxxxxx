,Trond,2007-08-10T13:14Z,"It says 4 seeders now, on this site... Not in torrent client, and it have never said more than one... Maybe he seeds/stops/seeds/stop and thats why the site counts more than  one seed?

If you look at the peers for this torrent, there is 1x100% and a couple with 99,7 (+-)..."

,JTCricket,2011-06-15T01:21Z,"I currently have a very fast 24 meg cable/ethernet connection,  but I dont have a lot of experience in this new BitTorrent online video game.    

Could someone please teach me how to SEED?   And I will indeed SEED.  

As a former boy scout,  its in me to do good deeds,   each day.  To hold no greed,  but help those who are in need. 
What now is this that I read.... tell me what about this SEED?   

I am HERE TO HELP!  (Boy Scout Salute)  ... and I'm honorable,  thrifty, brave,  clean & reverent...... and I'm PROUD to BE A PART OF World Wide BITTORRENT ""SERVICE PROJECT!"" 

Together we can make a difference.   So how do I seed?  "
