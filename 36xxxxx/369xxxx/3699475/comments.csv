,Rezoken,2010-01-01T18:36Z,"Orionsune,when i download it says the file is too big to be saved in its format and then the download stops due to an error about an overly large file.How to fix this?"
,DaN00berz,2010-05-30T10:01Z,"This game is very awesome, I finished downloading it and it did work PERFECTLY.

@Rezoken, check if you have enough hard disk space, and check your C drive property ans see if it's NTFS format or not. And if you can resume the download, it will check by itself and if the files are ok, then it will resume by itself. Good luck Rezoken."
,JosephXC,2010-11-13T16:11Z,hey guys i know im really late but for those who is still downloading this and needs to seed i'm gonna seed it in a little while cuz i just started downloading im leaving it to seed for hours and days
