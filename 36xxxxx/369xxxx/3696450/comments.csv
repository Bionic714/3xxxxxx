Three *great* films -- by Fassbinder, Kiarosami, and Wong Kar Wai -- within 65 minutes?

I've hope you've got good bandwidth, dude!"

Thanks!"
,kegir,2007-05-25T18:25Z,I hope you enjoy the films jgabriel and thanks for the comment. One thing with TPB is that there a so few comments. I do not up things to get comments though. If one person download and like the film is good for me. 10 Mbit/s is my up speed.
