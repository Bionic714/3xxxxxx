,Haywood Yublome,2007-05-29T14:55Z,"Olphus: That's whats usually referred to as 'hardsubs'. I would imagine that would be the case with this video, but I have no idea really since it isn't being seeded. "
,Olphus,2007-05-29T16:07Z,"Ah yes, hardsubs is the word. By the way I can't even find the movie on IMDB by Haruko or director."
,quixote73,2007-05-31T12:49Z,"Info about the film can be found if you google ""Haruko"" and ""Zainichi"". The film isn't listed in IMDB.

The subs are burned into the file. The file is being seeded, just not 24/7."
