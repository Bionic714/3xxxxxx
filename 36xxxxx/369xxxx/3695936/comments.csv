Two dll's, both dated from May 24th. When copied over the untouched SP1 dll's, the activation screen warning is gone when launching FSX and the performance boost from SP1 remains.

I see lots of activity on my second core and the same frame rates as with an untouched SP1 install.

I only tested for 10 minutes, so someone should confirm the same results on their end. Hopefully it won't boot us after 30 minutes.

This might be what we've been waiting for.

Nice find dimix99."
,allen_x,2007-05-24T11:25Z,what about single core dudes ? does it have a benefit ?
,dimix99,2007-05-24T11:43Z,Test it for yourself.....i've a single core (AMD 3500+) and got a performance increase about 100% or so....befor SP1 performance was teribble for me
[T],stevekasian,2007-05-24T11:44Z,"Just installed this crack to the latest version of FSX SP1 and it doesn't work. I still get the activation screen at startup.

It's possible M$ updated the latest SP1 download to a new build, but it doesn't work  nonetheless.

Fuck! I want to see if FSX is actually worth a shit. If SP1 doesn't give it AT THE VERY LEAST a 40% inclrease in performance, then it's still a piece of shit."
,dimix99,2007-05-24T11:49Z,"works for me flawless with a fresh installed FSX+SP1 (6.2.0029.0)...
what Version has your SP1 installer ?  ("
[T],stevekasian,2007-05-24T11:53Z,"Mines the same build - Complete information:

6.2.0029.0 (SRV03_QFE.031113-0918)

Is yours from an earlier date by chance?"
,dimix99,2007-05-24T11:56Z,"it's the same date..and the same Version ;)


i first copied the dll's over the originals...it works.

i uninstall and reinstalled FSX+SP1 and it works ;)"
[T],stevekasian,2007-05-24T12:01Z,"Hmm... well, don't work over here.
I installed FSX - used it. Then installed SP1, started it and got the nag screen.
Then I copied the 2 DLLs overwriting the originalz, and still get the nagger (ops, n word there).
'That how u did it?"
,Alex Wing,2007-05-24T12:03Z,After 30 min it still want activation :-(
,dimix99,2007-05-24T12:08Z,"""After 30 min it still want activation"" 

rly ? :(   then sry guys, hav'nt testet it so long"
[T],stevekasian,2007-05-24T12:09Z,"dimix99: Did u uninstall & reinstall FSX PLUS SP1 before you applied the 2 new DLL filez?

If so, that meanz the 3rd file (""main.dll"") from RAZOR911's first crack may need to be deactivated in order to get the new crack 2 work. Perhapz???"
[T],stevekasian,2007-05-24T12:10Z,Nvrmind then. Thanks all for the running progress reportz :-)  MUCH apprec.!
,LOgo55,2007-05-24T12:21Z,"Not working for me to.When you start the game it doesnt ask you anymore to activate, but the time limit still remain."
,Art-art,2007-05-24T12:41Z,Not working

,allen_x,2007-05-24T13:01Z,"no problem mate, you're effort is appreciated."
,Xochimilco,2007-05-24T13:26Z,"Not working after 30 mins, now i'm going to do a fresh install without RAZOR911's first crack and see what happens...."
,dbuster,2007-05-24T14:34Z,I told you this isn't the procedure. i had also made .dlls but none worked
,durik,2007-05-24T14:54Z,"Initially it seems to work and there is MP listed, but after ~30 minutes it asks for activation.
So nope, this isn't working as it should!!!"
,Xochimilco,2007-05-24T15:06Z,"Well i got at Italian version and actually it works!!!! But there are some problems to fix, is that the menus are in italian, and off course it got a virus on it but i manage to fix it... now is just to know what are the dll files to overwrite for the english version, any one got some ideas??"
,younlaot,2007-05-24T16:06Z,"Just replace the language.dll with the language.dll from your old installation.  But the cracks on emule for bypassing activation currently take away SP1 benefits, like dual core usage.  So beware.  You should wait until a good cracking group releases a crack.  Or, backup ALL of you dlls before using the crack so that you can replace them when a real crack comes out."
,Xochimilco,2007-05-24T16:53Z,"younlaot  you'r right, is not no point to do anything... is not working the SP1 that way.. thanx for the help. we will wait for a good crack, thanx people for your help."
,KLM1604,2007-05-24T17:08Z,"Hi,

I did total new install, first FSX, then SP1 and then I put the two dll files into main folder of FSX.
During the start up no activation window, but after 30 min I became the message ""thanks for use the trial version, now you must registrated FSX"".
So this crack isn't work !!!"
