[T],naxosking,2007-05-17T02:43Z,"Popular Hungarian gypsy music owes much of its form to earlier aristocratic encouragement. In particular the csardas, which makes use of folk elements, provided entertainment for the nobility, among whom it was supposed that the csardas, which derives its name from the word csarda, a country inn, was danced on Sunday afternoonns by the peasantry. The dance was introduced to polite society in the late 1830s, notably, it is said, by Count Bela Wenckheim, who coined the name. The csardas is similar in form to the verbunkos or recruiting-dance, with its slow opening section and rapid second section, and has come to epitomize Hunagarian gypsy music. It was Franz Liszt who, in the heyday of musical nationalism, seized on the csardas as a source for his Hungarian Rhapsodies, wrongly supposing this to be an example of real Hungarian folk music, rather than the hybrid form that it was. It was left to Bela Bartok and Kodaly in a later generation to collect and classify the true folk music of Hungary and neighboring regions, distinguishing this from the form of popular music provided by the gypsy bands. The bands themselves have long history, whether providing music for the Esterhazy family at their great palace of Esteraza in the time of Franz Josef Hadyn or for later generations in less distinguished surroundings. Basic instrumentation continues very largely the traditions of the 18th Century, with a solo violin carrying the improvisatory melodic burden, accompanied by a second violin or viola, double bass and cimbalom, with the additional use of the the tarogato, an instrument similar in timbre to the clarinet, which sometimes replaces it. The tarogato has a long association with Hungarian nationalism and was at one time banned by the Austrian authorities for that very reason. The music of Ferenc Santa and his gypsy band includes examples of the csardas, with the famous use of the form by the Italian violinist Vittorio Monti (1868-1922), who made his later career in Paris. Also included is Skylark by the Romanian violinist and Carl Flesch pupil Grigoras Dinicu (1889-1949), who arranged a number of popular Romanian melodies and is well remembered for his famous Hora Staccato, using the traditional dance-form, also coupled here with a traditional doina, a popular improvisatory form. In addition to the prominent sol violin, the gypsy band also provides variety in solos for the cimbalom, with reminiscences of material used by Kodaly in his Hary Janos, and for the characteristic tarogato."
