So I can enable Text to Speech to all TomToms :)

The best way is to upload it to www:repidshare.com and then send me the url by mail."

,piratebay-vpn-user,2009-09-04T17:11Z,"Similiar problem: 
To get the latest maps running on a GO 710 doesnÂ´t work, it is obviously the navcore/ttsystem

Anybody knows how to patch that so GO 710 behaves like a GO 910?

See my problem in detail:
