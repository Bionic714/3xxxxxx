,toreodor,2007-06-03T22:08Z,Do not download!!! The keygen for serial number is virus (trojan dropper). Fuck you EvilHunter
,EvilHunter,2007-06-03T23:57Z,"Sorry about that but i didn't know that it was infected, the release is the orginal DEVIANCE release and i have not done anything to it.
ALL the files are the orginal files for a affilate site.
so i have no idea how it's end up as a trojan.
sorry about that, but if you have a decent antivirus software it's totaly harmless.
it's sure out of date to do any harm to your computer."

,niXony,2008-05-10T19:46Z,i cant find the crack
,RavenTrigun,2008-06-07T16:24Z,Downloading now. All keygens give false positives and if you can't take risks why are you here? -_- and secondly stop telling people not to download. THEY CAN DOWNLOAD IF THEY WANT. I only need the program not the keygen. So stuff it.
