,bluegamba,2007-06-03T08:13Z,"Btw, if you like this you should really check out ""Gentle Giant"". The album ""The power and the glory"" is a good one to start with. And whatever they did in the studio, they could do it live too!"

,sthprkn64,2008-05-07T23:56Z,"Their full-length debut, Mirrored, has been called ?breathtaking? by Pitchfork and ?joyous absurdism? by Blender, while The Guardian gushed that the band are in another league.

True, it?s like nothing else. Atlas, the first single from the album, sounds like an android Smurf squeaking sinisterly ?People will be people when they hear the sounds? over a sinister psychedelic Marilyn Manson-esque cabaret.

Sounds rubbish, right? NME made it their single of the week. As singles go, it?s no Crazy In Love or Chelsea Dagger, but, against the latest crop of rot, Atlas would be the one song you?d want to hear again, if only because one listen isn?t enough to determine whether it?s a work of genius or utter garbage.

Math rock as a whole is hit and miss, but it?s never short of inventive. It?s a cacophony of noise on first listen. Repeated tastes will either do nothing to stop your ears bleeding or shower your ear canals with creative wonderment."
,BackupPanic,2008-05-09T07:29Z,"when i try to download this torrent, Azureus says my destination folder does not exsist???  and it does this no matter where i try to save it?? anyone have any suggestions, besides destroy windows vista...=]"

,Optional,2008-06-16T21:19Z,"You beautiful, beautiful human being."
,lennarth,2008-12-03T22:20Z,BackupPanic: that's probably because of the fnutts in the directory name. Try renaming in any way possible.
,geogadddi,2009-03-11T21:47Z,Thank you so much :)
,LordKrepelka,2009-05-16T00:41Z,Has anyone come across Don Caballero - 'World Class Listening Problem'? It's the only album of theirs that I don't have.
