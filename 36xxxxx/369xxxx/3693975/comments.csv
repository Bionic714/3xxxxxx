,RahDaddy,2007-05-22T12:10Z,"Thanks a million! Donny Hathaways powerful voice is always welcome in my home. I'm looking for the album where he performs ""Little Ghetto Boy"", do you have it? Or anything else by Donny for all that matters... For some reason Donny's some what of an unknown, a hidden treasure. "
