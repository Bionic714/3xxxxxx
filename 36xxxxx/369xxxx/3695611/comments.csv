,kgashi,2007-05-26T17:56Z,Is it just one seeding here? just one that has 100% ?
,500Songs,2007-05-27T02:42Z,"I am the uploader, and currently the only seeder.  I have a crappy cable modem connection, and it is going to take about a week to get it out there.

But once it gets out, then it will spready pretty quickly, as there are currently 232 leachers, 31 on The Pirate Bay.

Be patient!"
,500Songs,2007-05-30T14:40Z,It's 87.5% out there.  Should be one in two days or less...
,djdomain,2007-05-31T03:36Z,"i am at 95%.   if someone else can seed this for a while so i can finish it (i DESPERATELY need it done), i will seed indefinitely.

Thank yoU!"
,500Songs,2007-05-31T12:03Z,It finally got 100% uploaded last night; uTorrent tells me 5 seeders total.  
,zankfrappa,2007-06-02T10:22Z,"Thx! Great work, you've really done this with love. I really appreciate it."

,MrPellie,2008-01-01T02:50Z,"you did a hell of a good job Thanks
:)"
,Rocket0808,2008-01-04T21:26Z,"Hey 500songs I just want to add my thanks for what is probably the most righteous upload in P2P history.  To take the time to find all of these songs in a LOSSLESS format is absolutely incredible.  I agree with some of the other that if there's a medal or an award for ""Best Upload"" you should get it.  A simple thank you doesn't seem like enough but it's the best I can do, I'll seed this as along as there are downloaders.

Thanks again."
,the_photosamurai,2008-01-08T09:04Z,"I have to agree with Rocket0808, this is seriously an amazing torrent and you really should get some kind of reward. I've just started listening to the list in reverse order counting up to #1, so i'm quite excited. 

Thank you!"
,odobo1,2008-01-09T04:54Z,"Great torrent friend, thanks."
,odobo1,2008-01-15T02:01Z,Maybelline no. 18 has a corrupted section at 1:28- 1:37.  It sounds scratchy.
,500Songs,2008-01-17T20:28Z,"I just checked back on this; I haven't even thought about it for a few months.  

odobo1, I listened to Maybelline, and I hear what you are describing, but I'm not sure it's ""corrupted"".  It sounds like this on the three different versions I have, from three different sources.  Perhaps that's how the ""master tapes"" sound now.

smithyj, ""Hot Stuff"" cuts off very short, and ""Living for the City"" cuts off about a second too soon.  I'm truly sorry that I didn't catch these before I uploaded the torrent.  In retrospect, I should have listened to the end of all 500 songs to check for such problems.  However, I can't imaging re-uploading this torrent; it was SO much work, and to have two different versions out there seems confusing.  

To everybody else, thanks for your kind words.  

"
,500Songs,2008-01-17T20:31Z,"Here's the problem for ""Living in the City"".  I got that track from the remastered version of Innervisions.  Track 3 is ""Living For The City"", and it bleeds over into Track 4, ""Golden Lady"".  Whoever mastered the CD picked a somewhat arbitrary point to cut off Track 3.

There is no such problem on another version, from Original Musiquarium Volume I.  But that version had inferior sound quality (in my opinion), so I didn't pick it."
,Flashbob,2008-01-22T04:50Z,"Thank you 500Songs, this is beyond great! It tpb would let me rate uploaders I`d give you a 20 out of 10...awesome !"
,Kev4000,2008-02-18T00:07Z,"Awesome! Works like a charm, no longer dead"
,JagoJerry,2008-02-21T17:14Z,"so i've waited, i've seeded...but can i read the files....nope whats going on here then ?!? ""FLAC"" i tryed downloading a flac reader thing but it would not fully dowload. what am i doing wrong ? "
,iarlaithe,2008-02-21T21:00Z,please seed!!! a mate of mine told me about one of the other shit versions of this torrent in mp3 format... fair play to 500Songs for all the hard work... i'm up to 70% extra seeders would be much appreciated
,zhogun,2008-02-26T23:01Z,"thx, greatest upload ever!"
,lizzy1216,2008-03-04T16:16Z,just happened to see this fine effort and am downloading it if for no other reason  than to show my appreciation for your generosity.
,echn111,2008-03-07T17:28Z,Excellent job getting this into FLAC.  Thanks.
,mr-opel,2008-03-17T23:52Z,why dos nobady seeding dis torent ?

,Dagor_88,2008-03-29T19:18Z,"OMG...I was so excited about this torrent and it's tracker is Demonoid which is down. That is the most depressing thing that has ever happened to me. :( WHY!?!?!?!
Someone needs to upload this on a public tracker or something..."
,sunshinestate,2008-04-04T00:40Z,"not only are these all great quality flac rips mostly remastered for cd, but the files have embedded album art as well! i'm probably going to end up backing this up on a few dvds and envoding them to V0, but whoever compiled these originally is a saint."
,casillero,2008-04-10T16:11Z,"Thanks, Great Collection"
,karunaguzman,2008-05-11T23:05Z,"This is absolutely amazing! From one Audiophile to the other, thanks so much for your hard work with this :)

,vorhees43,2008-06-24T11:38Z,Excellent. I actually found this collection in MP3 format @192k. I have been looking for a quality set. Thanks dude!
,zomg623,2008-08-02T17:51Z,"Could you please explain this part for aren't that much into the technical aspects of digital audio:

""So I set about collecting the 500 songs in FLAC (lossless) format. I searched for the best quality source that I could find for each song, focusing on remastered releases. 

Well, I never did get all of the sources I wanted, but I came pretty close (77.4% remastered), and now I\'m releasing it into the wild.""

Does this mean that not all of the song in the torrent are FLAC, or..?"
,zomg623,2008-08-02T17:52Z,"darn, that should've read:

""Could you please explain this part for people like me who aren't that much into"""
,salalah,2008-08-29T05:46Z,"If I'm logged into PirateBay, why is it telling I should be logged in to download it, and the page was denied? I was logged in."
,bobgroovy,2008-09-13T20:45Z,Please seed! Thanks!!
,500Songs,2008-09-17T20:05Z,"They are all FLAC, so they are all losslessly encoded from CDs.

I was just saying that some of the CD recordings were sketchy at best, and I had hoped to get better ones.

That's all."
,bojano54z,2008-09-20T23:42Z,"Hi from France! Very good job. I downloaded this torrent last year. During encoding aiff in Mac OS X, I get error for file 358 (Martha Reeves). Back to Windows I get message 'MD5 signature mismatch' for the same file with FLAC Tester. All other files are OK. I downloaded only this file 3 times again but always the same pb! All the very best! "
,500Songs,2008-10-04T20:09Z,"I can verify that that Song 358 (Nowhere to Run) does have an error at the source:

358 - Martha Reeves & The Vandellas - Nowhere To Run (1965).flac: WARNING, MD5 signature mismatch

Since my source has that error, every copy around has that error.  I can't tell you how hard I worked to make sure that this didn't happen, and it did.  I'm sorry for that.

Maybe when I get some time, I'll do version 2.1 of this; I have a lot of better-quality rips for the Motown songs.  And the Beatles songs..."
,JKJK,2008-11-11T23:15Z,"To the releaser: HOLY FĂ¸ck you are stupid!!!
Yo want to have the best sound quality on this release. THAT was exactly what I was looking for.

BUT YOU FOCUSED ON REMASTERED MATERIAL YOU ""#Â¤""#% EMBASIL! Remastered material does NOT have the best sound. It has the LOUDEST sound! Have you never heard about the loudness war?!  GOD DAMN!

The old original masters are superior in dynamics! Make a new selection in flac, FOCUSING ON OLD MASTERS. Then i will praise you like a god! ;)

All I have to say is WOW!"
,Bootyhunter,2009-05-01T23:56Z,JKJK = Idiot
,fleurtje123,2009-05-09T11:41Z,"@ JKJK: How about you release something worth listening? So far, your torrent list is empty."
,kimberd,2009-05-23T22:36Z,Brilliant torrent - thanks for taking the time to do this.
,superfastkyle,2009-06-04T07:08Z,"although JKJK could have been a little nicer, he is right. Remasters are usually just louder, or they have added ""noise reduction"" which just gets rid of music along with it. Not only that but some remasters are even worse for example One ozzy cd remaster doesn't even have the original bassist in it

PS You can use Replay Gain to make all your songs a constant volume."
,superfastkyle,2009-06-04T07:09Z,but thanks still for the time and effort

,minimind,2009-06-30T03:39Z,"I feel the worth of users pursuing such compilations. However, uTube video ""3Gmex_4hreQ"" warns against remastered versions, which sometimes seem to have to be approached with a dose of caution."
