I have copied all of the remaining Seasons, Covers, ETC to a new hard drive, but I will need to recreate the RatDVD Season 1 images and then recreate a new torrent and upload it again.  So, for those that started downloading this torrent, go ahead and delete the files and hopefully in a week or so, I should have it back up again."
,Viperone,2007-05-22T17:51Z,"It looks as if, I will be able to repair this torrent without anybody having to delete any of the files or having to make another torrent.  I will keep yall post."
,Viperone,2007-05-24T13:09Z,"Well folks, I not sure why, but for some reason as I was uploading this torrent for the second time, it has crashed another hard drive.  This time, I lost everything.  Consider this torrent now dead."
,Viperone,2007-05-24T16:45Z,"I will eventually recreate this torrent and upload again.  I will have to first clear enough space on my hard drive then create the Disk image files over again from DVD's.  Sorry, about the not be able to continue this torrent.  I wish I knew why it killed two hards drives in the process of uploading this torrent.  "

,aussiedavid,2007-12-16T17:19Z,Thanks for trying Viperone! Sorry to hear about your hard drives. They are fickle little critters!
,guitarlesson,2009-02-16T04:51Z,"Too bad you used RATDVD to make these. RATDVD only runs in Windows, and I'm a Mac user. In the future, consider using one of the many freeware applications that convert DVDs into standard ISOs. (Not that I don't appreciate you making these files available. I do)"
