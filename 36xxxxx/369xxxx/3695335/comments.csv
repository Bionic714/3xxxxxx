,Chryloz,2007-05-26T23:57Z,"well.. thing is i seed these episodes with limewire too and if i rename them they become own new files that makes the ppl DLing from me unable to dl the same file from another host. u just have to move the icons withing the folder so they are in order, its not that much to do is it? i hope u understand ;)"
,XeroX-DK,2007-05-27T11:42Z,"ahhh.. okay then..

I can't find the seeder anymore.. =("
,Chryloz,2007-05-27T11:59Z,im just seeding to 2 ppl at a time so they have to seed to the rest... that makes them get the pieces faster and can start seeding them :)
,XeroX-DK,2007-05-27T13:28Z,Okay.. thanks for that..
,Chryloz,2007-05-27T23:37Z,"i hope u see the point in me just seeding to 2 ppl at a time or else i'd upload the same part twice making it slower for ppl to get the whole one... or else there would be like that, that everyoneone just has like 30% of it not being able to get anymore cuz im seeding the same parts theyve got to someone else... by now 2 ppl have around 60% making YOU able to get 60% aswell instead of less. trust me im doing all i can :P"
,XeroX-DK,2007-05-27T23:49Z,hmm.. the one who has 66.8% isn't uploading... almost everyone is stuck at 58.. :(
,XeroX-DK,2007-05-27T23:56Z,Oh and by the way. Do you know how many episodes yu-gi-oh gx has? 
,Chryloz,2007-05-28T07:18Z,i have no idea of how many there are :/ i have everyone up until 90 but then i also have episode 106 or something like that. ill upload all i have thats complete and then mb someone else may upload the other episodes ;)
,XeroX-DK,2007-05-31T22:29Z,Hey. I just want to hear one last thing. When do you upload the next episodes? Almost finished with the others. :D
