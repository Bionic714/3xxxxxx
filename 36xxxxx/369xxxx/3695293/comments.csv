,Nescio,2007-05-23T17:00Z,"No, you can't! Thanks a lot, DTSES. "
,Femke22,2007-05-23T17:41Z,"lol DTSES, no seriously I believe you. ...only a few more to go, so please dont stop now. I really hate incomplete stuff.

Anyways, THNX AGAIN for sharing, added this one to my shopping cart. Still busy grabbing your last release, nearly finished.

- I'm pushing my luck here.... but do you by any chance got/own the 2 un-official releases and an R2 (DTS) copy of Casino Royale 2006? Would sure be great to have all 23 of 'em in the same quality! ;)"

This R3 realese is the only totaly uncut one (both R1 and R2 is slighty cut by 20 sec or so if I'm not wrong) and aswell the only realese with DTS sound. Limited subs though."
