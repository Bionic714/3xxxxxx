,morevin,2007-05-26T15:37Z,"This is a High Quality movie, if you want to watch DVD quality, download somewhere else....

,morevin,2007-05-26T15:39Z,"Sigun, why don't you just buy the DVD version, its cheap. This Bluray quality is definitely not for you"
,airyvimanyake,2007-05-29T23:29Z,"VLC Player will play this file easily if you have a processor that can handle the file.. i am using a 2.33GHz Intel Core 2 Duo, ATI Mobility Radeon X1600 graphics with 256MB SDRAM, 3GB 667 DDR2 SDRAM, dvi output projecting 2560x1600 on 42"" HD TV facing no problems at all with all types of HD rips"
,rc71,2007-05-31T01:22Z,Dude!  Awesome Quality.  Thanks. Better than a lot of 1080p stuff out there.
,airyvimanyake,2007-06-03T15:50Z,does anyone know whats the diff btwn this and the other 720p  Pirates of carrbean version that is 5.7 GB ???
,CorE FreaK,2007-06-06T01:22Z,"720p is a smaller HD resolution than 1080p. 720p is made up of 1280 (horizontal) x 720 (vertical) pixels. 1080p is made up of 1920 (horizontal) x 1080 (vertical) or 1440 (horizontal) x 1080 (vertical) (anamorphic) pixels.

In other words, if you compare 720p and 1080p movies on a 42"" TV, you will notice that the 1080p most likely looks better. The pixel size in 720p is much larger on a 42"" TV than 1080p. The smaller the pixel size the sharper the picture is."
,CorE FreaK,2007-06-06T01:25Z,"I don't know for sure if this is 1080p or 720p, but if it's 720p, then the only difference probably is the content or the way the movie has been put on the computer."
,oswald1234,2007-06-09T09:21Z,"WOW, this release is most likley 1280x544,,,as most 720p  are...1080p releases are available but unless you have a quad core procesor... expect some glitches in playback.See  you  on 1080p,,, ask for help from   oswald1234 (:"
,MCFC OK,2007-06-15T19:36Z,"Thanks for the upload, it looks stunning. Would some kind soul who knows what they are doing (i'm stupid and have been trying for hours) upload Finnish subtitles that are in synch with this movie.

Been trying for ages to synchronise the subs but just can't get my head around it."
