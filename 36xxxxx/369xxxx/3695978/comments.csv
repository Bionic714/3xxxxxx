,plumbo1221,2007-05-24T17:13Z,"Haven't completed download yet, but it is a two episode season finale, so ep 22 and 23 should be correct.  http://www.tv.com/lost/show/24313/episode_listings.html?season=3&tag=nav_bar;3"

,dobardan,2007-05-24T19:45Z,Can we please get some real clarity into this? What you all mean is that there are two parts of the 22´nd episode and that there will be a 23´rd and final episode as well??
