,DrunkOnShadows,2007-07-31T15:07Z,"Somethings wrong here... When i open the game after installing it, it is extremely important, that I do not touch my mouse... Otherwise, windows will say it has found an error, and has to close the game... But what's the fun of only using the bazooka the entire time... I cant't left click to selecet another weapon... 

WTF is going on...?? "
