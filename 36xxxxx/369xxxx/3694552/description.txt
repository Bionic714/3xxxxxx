This album was recorded recorded inside the Widow Jane Mine in the Catskill Mountains by Tony Levin, Jerry Marotta and Steve Gorn. From random review:

=========================================
The album opens with just the background noise in the caves, illustrating exactly what the ambience is like, followed by the interplay between Levin's Chapman Stick, Marotta's Taos Drums, and Gorn's Bansuri Bamboo flute. The instrumentation is minimalist and subtle, and the natural reverb, the noise of the crickets, the sound of water, all add to the beauty of the music. 

The flute makes the album very "eastern" sounding, and the accompanying drums gave a primal feel to them. Levin "holds down the bottom" while playing some cool riffs every so often. His is the only instrument that could be classified as "rock" and the contrast enhances the quality and mood of this album. The music could be best described as Eastern-jazz.
