,mtj111,2007-06-02T21:56Z,"Thanks for the list, but what was the point of using E for easy and expert? 

Obviously a song with only E will be expert-only, but it's still a little confusing."
,ozelotbeaver,2007-06-04T17:55Z,"so.. if you play any of the songs at a different difficulty than specified in the list, the game freezes or what?.."
,GuitarHero86,2007-06-08T08:04Z,"Is this torrent the whole game or just the songs? 

If I burn this .iso to DVD it will work on my PS2?"
,mrspock09,2007-06-08T20:17Z,thats what i'm wondering too GuitarHero86
,HeroGuitar,2007-06-09T02:50Z,this game is for ps2 only  :)
,GuitarHero86,2007-06-11T13:02Z,"HeroGuitar, I meant is this torrent just the custom songs or the whole game.
Could Guitar Hero II fit to 1.94 GiB??"
,GuitarHero86,2007-06-11T13:35Z,"I hope this is full version...
not some sucky demo."
,danne34,2007-06-13T12:15Z,"how the hell am i supposed to get more songs when i can't complete the impossible E (expert) ones in the beginning, if you have a memory card with the ordinary guitar hero save files (with all songs) do you have all songs in this one too ?"
,LordSkatan,2007-06-17T09:59Z,"To answere questions:
Even though its 1.9 gb it extracts to 3.14gb
Obviously, you gotta have a modded ps2 to run it. And even if you do, this game is in PAL format I'm pretty sure. So on NTSC tv's the screen will get cut off at teh bottom (just enough so you cant see the notes. I think its fixable with ps2_pal2ntsc_yfix)
Also even if you've earned everything in the orginal GH2 it wont load any of that data it'll just create a new,seperate save from scratch.
And yes, it freezes if you pick a difficulty not listed above."
,GuitarHero86,2007-06-19T11:18Z,"Can't I add my own songs??
Because when I load MAIN.HDR in Guitar Hero Explorer it says that it has to be verified so I verify it. Once it has verified it says that the file contained bad data."
,LordSkatan,2007-06-19T21:50Z,to answere danne34. Just punch in these buttons on the main menu. BYOROYBYBYBYBYBY
,IamLemmy,2007-06-20T03:48Z,"Yes, GuitarHero86. This DVD1 has a problem... And, it is impossible to edit its.

One solution is: recover all file, and use an other GH ISO to edit, and include the songs...  "
,GuitarHero86,2007-06-20T12:32Z,Thanks for info IamLemmy.
,Jegreen,2007-06-20T14:33Z,Thanks HeroGuitar. It's a good release. It's too bad that a lot of songs aren't syncronized with the fret hits. I am still enjoying it though.
,gutosoft,2007-08-02T15:17Z,"how I make one with my songs ?

thanks

augusto@gutosoft.cjb.net"
,KillerOne,2007-08-04T09:00Z,what should i do to get get songs listed in the menu ? 
,skunkyg420,2007-08-18T18:37Z,"For some reason all these dvds that come from this soti guy play in black and white.;
If anyone knows how to fix this problem, please let me know. 
When I play my swap disk it works fine, but as soon as I put in the game to load it plays black n white. Somebody help!!"
