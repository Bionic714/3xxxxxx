 TS / SCREENER ? CAM..."
,swejen,2007-05-26T12:03Z,"very bad cam, download the sample and see for your self"
,metsapeikko,2007-05-26T21:49Z,"Oh well, it seems like the quality is best around... Sound quality 2/5
Video quality 4/5

Video quality is clearly better than most cams, but sound quality is quite bad."
,Dragonfly_80,2007-05-26T23:41Z,"0,5 out of 10"
,pimpwiththis,2007-05-27T02:01Z,Is this the the one where the beginning is good till have way through and the the video just goest to hell.  I mean you can't see a fucking thing...  Please don't be that piece of shit floating around...
,joseppi,2007-05-27T07:37Z,"I tried to watch this today and most of the movie the sound is out of sync. I tried playing this with vlc, mplayer and os x dvd player and the problem was the same on my both my iMac and mbp. Towards the end the video goes to hell and there's like fifteen minutes where you can't tell what the hell is going on. Still, this is perhaps one of the best pdvd's I've seen in a long time and may just be the best quality of this movie floating around to date."
,joseppi,2007-05-27T07:39Z,"It's all annoying split rar files, too. "
,metsapeikko,2007-05-27T10:15Z,I just watched it. It sucked... Whole movie was made of failure. Plot... Everything....
,deltArate,2007-05-27T21:48Z,"i dont know why so many fuckboys are seeding this peice of shit, it looks like someone filmed this with a cellphone, the uploader should be shot. All these ""StarDVD"" torrents are all shitty fake cams. so dont bother with this garbage and thanks for wasting everyones time SkurrePurre2"
,SkurrePurre2,2007-05-27T23:55Z,"deltArate, i think u can't read fucking bitch. You should be knocked in your face. You complain a movie thats not has been released in DVD yet. Fuck you and learn to READ NFO first!!!

FROM THE NFO:

Remember that's PDVD isn't is a RETAIL DVD RLS!
This rls has not the best quality but it's
watchable. If u gonna complain the rls, go to hell!
Please learn u what PDVD is!"""
,SkurrePurre2,2007-05-27T23:56Z,"Sneak_Peak, i think u haven't a life if you complain the group ""StarDVDr.."" This guys don't hanging here at TPB bitch, don't think they will see your shitty comment.

If you dosen't want ""PDVDS,"" don't download it! Wait until RETAIL DVD!"
,SkÃ¥nepÃ¥g_1965,2007-05-28T17:10Z,"Fan vad alla gnäller, ni vet väl vad e pdvd är.
Ladda ner eller skit i det.....o sluta gnäll.
Allt e ju frivilligt här."
,Mizled,2007-05-29T00:17Z,This movie is REALLY dark at times and any camera is going to be completely unwatchable. The only good downloads for this movie are going to be an actual Screener or the Retail DVD Release itself. There's parts of the movie where you can't see anything at all for 5-10 minutes due to the source being a cam.
,MilesDeep,2007-05-29T00:27Z,"Some Cams arent bad but this one is ridiculous, i agree with the cellphone comment. My cellphone coulda recorded this way fucking better. SkurrePurre2 go fist yourself. allowing this trash to be passed on to people who want a decent flick to watch on their tv so they dont have to go to the theater....WHAT THE FUCK KINDA NAME IS SKURREPURRE2 Anyway. Cock juggling cum dumpster!!!"
,MilesDeep,2007-05-29T00:31Z,"Oh and actually....in defense of deltArate....the guys who wrote the NFO (there musta been a few of them) cant fucking spell, read, write or even jerk eachother off right. 

Thats PDVD isnt is, please learn u....like fuck off"
,Vampyre_Byte,2007-05-29T15:43Z,"Quality is passable at best.  Still watched it.  Plot could've been better.  It is, of course, free, so thanks for the up and seeds.

@MilesDeep.... hmm... must be referring to the crater someone tossed your brain into.

We all appreciate the fact that you haven't posted a single damn torrent here, but will happily shoot-to-shit other people's.  

COMMENT on the quality of the torrent, but keep your stupid name calling to the schoolyard... or at least get better at it.  Yawn.
"
,Wompa,2007-05-31T14:45Z,"The one that complains about a free DVD or StarDVDr has a problem. Cant people understand that its free and no one forces you to download it if you dont want to. 
Sit down on you huge ass and wait for a Proper then if you are bother by the quality. 

Tackar för denna!! Riktigt nice ;)"
,rangersoul,2007-05-31T15:30Z,Wait for aXXo's version!!!
,Lordslim,2007-05-31T23:19Z,Piss Bild piss Ljud pallar inte se skiten
,Aphael,2007-06-02T03:21Z,"""Please learn u what PDVD is!""

LMAO!

Gotta love it when dingbats try to sound tough and fail miserably. :)"
,Freacable,2007-06-04T01:40Z,"Visst...  Man kastar bort sin tid på sånhär skit och missar att det är en usel screener.  Nyckelordet är screener. Nytt begrepp ""PDVD"".

Hur som helst. Jag frågar VEM I HELVETE KAN ÖDSLA TID PÅ ATT GÖRA SÅN SKIT???

Och dessutom sitta och översätta skiten. Hoppas subbarna passar till det bättre materalet.

Jag fattar inte heller hur man kan göra en så påkostad produktion med Robert Carlyle och köra med dogma-film. Fullständigt värdelös film.
Och så släpper man en sketen screener av skiten. har ni så tråkigt, grabbar?"
,Freacable,2007-06-04T01:45Z,"...och en liten vink om att det är total smörja-film, är ju det faktum att man ser hur fler i publiken reser sig och lämnar salongen...
Fan ""Hills have eyes"" är ju en dunderfilm i jämförelse... (också övervärderat skräp av en bortskämd snorvalp som fått tag i en kamera)"
,Quality^^,2007-06-05T20:14Z,"Tja, det är jag som är Tobias (Killen som skrev undertexten till filmen). 
Undertexten till filmen skrevs inte åt denna releasen utan åt 28.Weeks.Later.INTERNAL.TS.XviD_CAMERA_-_CT_-   så passar den inte - Skyll inte på mig :D
Sen får jag väl tack SkurrePurre2 för att han ens brydde sig om att ge mig credit för undertexten (Flera andra har redan snott den :D).

Denna releasen är onödigt stor och ger INTE bättre kvalité än releasen jag textade från början (Som bara är 697MB).

Ladda ner denna istället: http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3690167/28.Weeks.Later.INTERNAL.TS.XviD_CAMERA_-_CT_-"
,Pettersson111,2007-06-07T21:59Z,"tackar tackar  !!!!

finfint jobb skurrepurre2 och stardvdr för snabb release + snabb översättning !"
,deltArate,2007-06-19T20:18Z,"fake as hell, bullshit cam, dont download, dont waste your time like i did, and can TPB please get rid of SkurrePurre2 for uploading all these shitty ass  torrents"
,ad011i6510,2007-06-25T15:56Z,"he said pdvd not dvd rip retard,he also said quality was watchable but not best.if you learned to read you would have known this.DUM DEE DOO"
,sys-error,2007-07-06T19:08Z,"dear gods people, why does everyone act like children, calling people idiots stupid etc?

be nice, its easier.

he said pdvd, he said quality is not the best but it is watchable. this is not a bloody fake."
,kockunge,2007-08-04T16:08Z,i agree its in the cinema (theater) so ofcourse its a screener. i u want better do it your self or wait for the relase
