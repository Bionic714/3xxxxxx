,PirateWilmo,2007-05-25T17:08Z,Care to be more exact on the info? What is this? Some homebrew Vista that will mess up your pc???
,shadow_001,2007-05-25T18:41Z,"OMG!!!!

if you feel it will mash up your pc then don't download it!!!!!..........simple

i personally am not into releasing fake or dud files
what i will say about it is it is a copy of the pre installed vista on all dell retail pc's...

there for no serial needs to be inputed.....
the software is installed and activated automatically......as if you had just bought your pc from acomputer store BRAND NEW!!

as i say your choice if you choose to download.....if you don't i can use the bandwidth for someone who does!!!!

either way i don't give a stuff!!!..........i already have it running on my system :)"
,boorstar,2007-05-25T18:53Z,Cheers for the upload dude.
,boorstar,2007-05-25T18:57Z,"I will thank you, even though no one else will.

Ill download it first, install it then whinge if its crap.  I know it wont be, haven't had a problem with any of your releases so far.

Keep them cumin dude :)
