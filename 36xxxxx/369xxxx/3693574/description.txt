This project-based guide from Adobe will teach readers all they need to know

to create engaging interactive content with Flash CS3. Using step-by-step 

instructions with projects that build on the knowledge learned in each lesson,

readers will learn the key elements of the Flash interface, including panels,

timelines, and frames. From there, readers will learn how to work with vector

and bitmap graphics; create and edit symbols; modify text and add interactivity

with ActionScript 3.0; and incorporate animation, music, and sound to their 

projects. They'll also learn how to prepare and export their finished projects

for Web and broadcast. Of course, readers will also learn how to take advantage

of the new features of Flash CS3--the streamlined user interface, native support

for Photoshop and Illustrator files, revamped drawing tools, new video encoding

features, code editing enhancements, and much more.
