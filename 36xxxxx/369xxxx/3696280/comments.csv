DrMight 
please dont take this the wrong way ok
i see you have made a new torrent
of the first one, well thats what i am downloading
but my question is this!
if you keep having probs by not being connected
how on earth with all the seeders on your first one
and how are you going to cope uploading  this one at the same time with over 50 leeches as well??

i am happy continuing with your first one
as it is now @ 5.7 %

i just think doing this upload when your first one of this is not finished is a really bad idea, with your upload speed.."
,DrMight,2007-06-05T16:08Z,"Closed the other one..
If someone would plz help me seed, there would not be that long waiting time on it...
20 downloads by now.."
,Shutit108,2007-06-10T04:14Z,Just a warning; got a letter in the mail about illegally downloading heroes season one after I used this torrent.  My ISP has threatened to drop me.
,DrMight,2007-06-11T18:12Z,"lol, cool, plz scan it and upload it..
btw, norwegian ISPs dont hand out ip's, so its safe to download this."
,russell1nash,2007-07-19T03:01Z,"
any1 else had this ISP problem? 

thanx for answering!"
,pody,2007-07-25T21:33Z,"anyone knows why is there an .exe file??

,DrMight,2007-07-29T15:01Z,"think i left mpc in one of the folders..

,mr.grandmother,2007-08-29T20:44Z,seed plzzzz;)
,resonator,2007-10-10T17:15Z,"Thanks for the upload, but I was disappointed in this TV-series, very weak compared to Lost or Prison Break for example."
,WampireH,2007-10-21T15:57Z,more seeders! seed!
