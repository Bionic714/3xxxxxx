,sonofwill,2009-08-30T10:57Z,"GREAT movie, but just a FYI, the subs work UNTIL about 64 minutes into it. After that the subtitles start appearing about 20 seconds before the corresponding video.  

I'll look around for other subtitle tracks and link them if I can find them."
,sonofwill,2009-08-30T12:41Z,"Bingo.  Found a perfect English subtitles version, available here:
