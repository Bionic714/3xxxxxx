,FUCK_OFF_WEASEL,2008-02-27T08:42Z,"To install the brushes, extract the RAR, open Photoshop, click on the paint brush tool, click on the brush options icon, click on the small arrow, click on ""Load Brushes"" and use the brushes. Or, extract the RAR, copy all of the bush files and paste them in C:/Program Files/Adobe/Photoshop CS3/Presets/Brushes

Thanks Timpi100, can't wait to see the brushes--"
