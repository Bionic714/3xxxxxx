Help seed 1:1 (min 4.5gb) and I can continue upload new ones, fair enough?"
,melfice26,2007-05-18T23:09Z,"You can do it!!!
hahaha
Thx again man. Great Uploads.
I will seed!"
,Rsites,2007-05-18T23:38Z,"Not to sound unthankful, but if you have the originals, maybe you could consider uploading the untouched DVD9 instead, so people could choose if they want the DTS track or DD5.1 track, or burn it as a DVD9 and get everything."
,DTSES,2007-05-19T00:02Z,"No sport to upload DVD9 and it takes way to long on the Bay so that is not going to happen, if you want DD 5.1 then search for the old realeses. These movies deserve DTS 5.1 sound I think together with the new picture quality and if you wants them in DD 5.1 then just go and buy them, I did!"
