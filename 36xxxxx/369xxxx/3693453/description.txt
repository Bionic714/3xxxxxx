Registry is a database where Windows and programs store their data. When data changes i.e. you delete a file, the registry doesn't remove the invalid data, thus in this case a reference to a non-existent file remains in the registry.
As the registry gets filled with invalid data, Windows and programs consume more system resources to search the database for any data. Therefore your computer gets slower and slower. Last but not least, passing invalid data to Windows programs can cause severe system complications resulting in system crash, hang and malfunction.

After a registry cleanup the invalid entries leave empty spaces, which means the size of the registry remains unchanged. It goes without saying that loading a small registry is faster than a big one.

The Auto run feature is a one-click registry backup, registry cleanup and registry defrag.

Furthermore if you own a copy of Abexo defragmenter you can configure them to work together. Just click a button and go to bed. All of the following tasks will be performed while you are asleep.
