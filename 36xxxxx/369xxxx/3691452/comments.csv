,Churchills Dog,2007-05-19T20:33Z,"jeez, your a little vague on your opinion of Vista DM....lol ;)

as always, thank you sir!"
,Churchills Dog,2007-05-19T20:36Z,"BTW, what fucking nitwit complains about a ripped game? Titles are approaching 10gigs installed lately. There needs to be more guys like Dopeman willing to take the time to do a proper rip."
,mikemn,2007-05-19T20:52Z,i agree with dopeman i like gaming and last time i used vista my computer was idle and using 500 mb ram maybe they fixed it but what a hog my xp uses around 60 mb. they trying to get to fancy i cant wait for this game will be seeding 2 to 1
,420dopeman,2007-05-19T21:44Z,"lol, cheers guys, 

Can ya tell i dont like vista?? 
"
,Churchills Dog,2007-05-20T06:18Z,"something really fuxor'd with the AI scripting...particularly in the opening segment of the jail escape. resart the game a few times until your companion follows you.

...and they wondered why this game failed at retail."
,420dopeman,2007-05-20T12:12Z,"yep, and If you conatct  support about it they basically just tell ya to fck off and not to conatct them about it agagin, that they dont support the game, real nice huh...

It also failed at retail cuz of the harse starfuck, at the time of release it wasnt even cracked untli like a year later, never even scene releaesed. It turned out to be independently cracked.
go figure.."
,420dopeman,2007-05-20T16:52Z,"btw, let me know if ya consider it, unplayable, cuz im just gonna remove if so, just thought I'd give some the chance to check out a basically, unreleased game until now..

And where are all the seeds?! :o "
,Churchills Dog,2007-05-21T03:07Z,"The game played OK for a few levels but then it started up its stupid shit again in Tor's neighborhood (after you visit his apartment). Unless I'm missing something I can't proceed because something just isn't happening.

Another negative: whoever wrote for this game should be made to listen to a tape of Tor's wife nagging over and over and over. Holy shit what an annoying bitch! Thats NOT the way to write in a sympathetic character."
,Smialy20,2007-05-31T02:00Z,"Hey dopeman!You are great guy in game torrent world!Life without your RIP games will be boring!So thank you for this another awesome Game RIP!:)

,DonYugo,2007-07-03T13:19Z,"Hi, when I open sufferingttb.exe, I get an error saying ""The game disk couldn't be found, please insert it into your CDROM drive and click OK or press cancel to exit"".
I've even tried downloading cracks from internet but it doesn't work that way either, PLEASE HELP!!

,lightningline,2007-07-13T01:19Z,"If it isn't working for you you are probably clicking on the shortcut to the Launcher. Dont do this. Go to the game folder and make a shortcut to SufferingTTB/Riot Engine. Dont forgrt to do dopemans registry thing to. For what it is worth I also got the crack from gamecopyworld . Go there and search for The Suffering The ties that Bind and find this download ""The Suffering 2 v1.0 [ENGLISH] No-CD/Fixed Files #2"" And un rar them both into your TTTB directory. I am not sure if the second rar containing the TTTB exe is even necessary. It worked for me :)"
,Gr1m01r3,2007-08-23T08:57Z,"Every time I double-click setup.reg I get the error message stating that setup.reg is not a valid win32 application, so I am unable to follow that part of your instructions."
,Paxthis,2007-09-04T17:00Z,When i run setup no problem. then i run the exe file. (not launcher) Then my screen goes plack but i can hear the game running through my speekers. Anyone know what might cause this problem?
,fasterthanhell,2007-09-16T17:14Z,"i have played all of you games and there is a lot of bugs in them, a couple of games has been good all the way true, but naa in all your not a good ripper'"
,madhouserevival,2007-10-20T06:57Z,"Dopeman, I built my own pc years ago and I've never had a game cause my computer to keep rebooting itself. This one did. Hell, I don't even get stop errors!

And the registry entry was for Battlezone, not this game! I think you shoud be removed from this site for spreading threats to peoples pcs."
,Tinface,2007-10-27T03:34Z,I'm getting this thing like...you know when you set the resolution to high on a CRT monitor? Well when I run the game that is what happens...can you release your games with the rez at 1024x768 @72 hurtz? Lolz...but that seems the most standard...
,Raulll87,2008-01-15T21:15Z,DOPEMAN 4 PRESIDENT! 
,stilbuzzing,2008-02-08T01:00Z,"Hey Dopeman i've said it once and i'll say it again you're the dogs nuts, (ok maybe not as cheezy) :-) keep up the good rips mate and anyone that gives you bad feedback should go out and pay their £30 for the same game i just downloaded for nothing. :-)

Dopeman is the bees Knees"
,KeyReaper,2008-03-02T09:11Z,"Maybe someone can help me with something....
In the first level when the riot starts, the guy tells me to follow him, but the AI apparently has some trouble making it through that door...
After he tries and fails to go through the door, the AI returns to the default behavior...(walking around)
Any ideas?"
,KeyReaper,2008-03-06T01:07Z,"Mmkay, never mind. The AI is a bit funky in the first       two or three(short) levels, then it evens out and gets pretty decent. I beat the game.....it's perfectly playable. I just had to restart the game a few times."
,Akutsi,2008-04-23T06:07Z,"Works perfect on vista 32bit.
Thx dopeman."
,hypnomoosebeaver,2008-06-09T19:46Z,"the game itself works great, not a problem, not even missing textures, but somehow the registry entries really messed up my (purchased) copy of the first game. any suggestions? already reinstalling it, hopefully that wont mess up ties that bind! =P"
,hypnomoosebeaver,2008-06-09T20:26Z,"ok, I figured it out, the registry file included (setup.reg) contains a non-perfunctory binary ([HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Surreal\Riot Engine]
""SettingsDX105"") which tailored the riot engine settings. simply delete this from the reg file or manually with regedit to avoid this problem should you own both games. deleting this value does not effect the playability of this release whatsoever."
,hypnomoosebeaver,2008-06-10T00:42Z,"errr meant perfunctory, anyway after about two hours of play through, one or two textures are still missing but its working at almost 100%"
,mavman64,2008-06-20T01:09Z,Is this an incomplete Rip?  After unrar its asking me for a cd.  Am I the only one to have this kind of issue?

,BloodRaven666,2008-08-07T22:18Z,Btw textures are maybe missing because it should be unzipped with 7z :S i will try with 7z and we'll see if it works with all of the textures :D

,maorifabio,2008-10-01T04:23Z,"Hey guys. Game runs fine, no problem with installing at all. One thing though - at the beginning of the game, where you have to go through a room where guards and inmates kill each other, and then get burned up by some flame monsters, a black dude walks on the catwalk above, and says ""i'ma go and open the way through"". I suppose he has to go and open the door, but he just turns around and stays there, doesn't go anywhere,  causing me to get stuck. Game bug? Any fix for that? Or i'm not doing something right?

thank you in advance."

,4p34p3,2011-03-01T21:37Z,"@Mental_Downfall

This happens when your monitor does not support resolution that game uses. Normally you get at first start some kind of configuration window, but in this release when you add setup.reg to your registry it adds uploaders settings (which has resolution your monitor can't handle). To make your own settings: open regedit, locate entry ""SettingsDX105"" from HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Surreal\Riot Engine delete it and start SufferingTTB.exe, now riot engine configuration window should pop-up and you can choose video & sound settings that work on your system."
