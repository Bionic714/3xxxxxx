\"Jumping with Jussi is an instructional movie for freestyle jumping. It\'s impossible to cover every single trick, so we decided to go with my favorites. From the beginning to the more technical 900\'s, there is something for everyone! I teamed up with Mack Dawg Productions to ensure the very best film quality. We cover every possible angle so you get the clear vision what I\'m talking about.\"
