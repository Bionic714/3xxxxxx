,wildcatwillie,2007-05-30T22:51Z,"I am having problems with my system. I may not be able to continue. About 40% of the file has been uploaded so far. 

You can get the rest from Ancestry.com. I got them from there. 

After viewing each one, I copied the FLV file out of my Temporary Internet Files folder and renamed it to match the name on the list. 

From now until June 6, 2007 you can get a free guest account there which will let you view these newsreels.
