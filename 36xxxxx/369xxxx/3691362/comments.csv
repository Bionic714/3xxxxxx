,JimsonHawk,2007-07-27T15:28Z,This is the movie version of the manga series and was made in 1984. The movie was actually made after the series and gives a better storyline than the series. The good thing about the series is that you get to know more about the different fighting styles of the characters.
,guide18quick,2007-09-27T05:06Z,I've loved F.O.T.N.S ever since I was a Kid!  Thanks!
,TheJuiceMan1,2007-11-14T20:52Z,"this is one of my favorite movies.  when i get the series, im gonna upload it.  dont resist downloading because of lack of seeders/leechers listed, there is usually 4 or more of us, and almost always someone with 100%, ill never remove this from azureus seeding."
,wumpman,2008-03-22T19:52Z,"Thanks been looking for this one a while, i lost it a year ago!"

,bittorrentor,2008-11-03T16:31Z,Got it!!! Finally... i'll seed this one for a lonnnnggg time now. Hang in there... i gotcha.
,CyberDethX,2008-11-05T02:30Z,"Great movie, this copy is jumpy though, seems to skip frames on a regular basis.  Tried different codecs and player combos, it's the actual rip that skips frames.  If you can get past it, its a great watch!  Thanks Bowen83"
,bittorrentor,2008-11-10T17:36Z,Very right! Hehe... i was so excited to watch an old favorite again that i forget to remember to realize... it skips frames!  Camera pans are especially choppy as a result. The opening scene is a prime example. F#*king awesome movie though and i'm glad to have SOME copy of it. Thanks Bowen83.
,supersizeme,2008-12-14T14:14Z,Cheers Bowen - great film
,ThePriestman,2009-07-27T10:49Z,Great film but it almost looks like you recorded it with a camcorder
,ThePriestman,2009-07-27T10:52Z,"Also, anyone know where I could find a torrent for Shin Hokuto no Ken (New Fist of the North Star)?"
