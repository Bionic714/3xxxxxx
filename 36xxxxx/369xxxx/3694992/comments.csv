,EevilJ,2008-05-16T09:47Z,"Yup. It's a documentary. Chrolle is right. We should all just fantasize about missionary sex after marriage. While wearing our clothes and fucking through mesh.

Thanks for saving me from anything fun or imaginative, Chrolle! I'm off to beat my kids and judge others now."

,fistorbefisted,2008-07-06T01:57Z,"would have been more believable if the taped up dude stopped squirming like a tard, and head-butted the rapist..
still good porno"
,winfidel,2010-06-23T08:00Z,"No one ever thinks about how traumatic it is for the rapist.

I myself have social anxiety disorder so sexual assaults even though they get me out of the house, which is good because isolation is not always healthy... still knowing that I am being graded on my performance as a rapist... it creates stage fright and Performance Anxiety... 

its not easy, its physically demanding, takes stamina and involves extraordinary mental processes. Even though I try to make it look so effortless and natural I have to give credit where credit is due... I'd like to thank HB Studies where I  had great acting coaches like  Charles Nelson Reilly, Austin Pendleton, Larry ?Bud? Melman and Brother Theodore. 

Without their dedication to the craft, with out Uta Hagans book Respect for Acting I would not be the rapist I am today. 

It's not just about knowing your lines, how to project your voice, to use body language to accomplish goals, the importance of props and how they compliment a scene / performance. No it's much more... you have to love what you do... thats what sells it... if the audience orhostages see that level of commitment... well its a whole other experience for them.

Of course this is not the proper venue for shout outs...and I am only kidding...."
