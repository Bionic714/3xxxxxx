Britcom with first feature film appearance by a young(ish) Ricky Gervais in a smal role as a nightclub bouncer.

A group of twenty-somethings, one of whom is a single father with a precious daughter, have been unsuccessfull in getting into a certain club so they can have a chance to DJ in thereand start a career out of it. A series of events has lumbered them with a dog napping scheme gone badly wrong, ending up with them currently owning a particular pooch belonging to a dog-loving local drug dealer.

Not a great film, but very funny.
