I'm especially excited about the opening tracks taken from ""The Songs of Distant Earth"", my favourite Album. :D
THX for sharing!!"
,beenbee,2007-05-27T18:28Z,Oh yes Mike rocks! And this particular gig is one of the best I've ever heard. The quality is outstanding and IMO some tracks are better than the album versions!

One of the best Oldfield-live-concerts I've heard and damn good quality too. "
