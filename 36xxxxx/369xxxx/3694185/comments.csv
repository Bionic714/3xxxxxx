,irontowngeek,2007-05-22T16:46Z,"Pretty much a dodo these days. Can't find good
recent software or tools that will go back that far to make anything out of it.

It does however make for a fast thin client running CygWin and the KDE Desktop port.(no bulk) I use it from my hack-box to connect to my Fedora Core6.(no bulk)
IF you like the VM route,get the ""experience""
version of Windows 2003.
I run it as a VM under ZenWalk."
[T],wacko506,2007-05-22T19:04Z,huh??
,irontowngeek,2007-05-23T01:27Z,"Which ""huh"" are you refering to?"
[T],wacko506,2007-05-23T11:52Z,lol im not too sure what you mean =-)
,irontowngeek,2007-05-23T13:12Z,"I was refering to you using 98 with VirtualPC.

I haven't tried Vpc out yet,I think you can still get it from MS >?

I used 98  with VMware for Linux and kept it around for WINE,for the native *.dll's.
CygWin is a Unix X server for Windows so I can run a few Unix apps on my Windows 2000 PC.
without having to boot out of Windows into 
Linux. I have WinLinux 2003 residing on the same drive.
ZenWalk is a virtualized version of Linux.
I found a Windows 2003 ""lean"" model on the
""bay"". built by ""eXPerience"",that runs pretty
good as a VM and fits my needs under
VMware. 
Most companies are phasing out 98 support,and
limits its use down to ""play"" ware.
I thought since you seem to be a gamer,you
might want to try out a newer OS that has some ""fat"" trimmed down,to use with Virtual PC for
the newer games.
(I don't know your PC resources.)

I wasn't trying to ""dis"" your upload,it was my
point of reference in comparing  my use to your VM use.

Regards.

[T],wacko506,2007-05-23T16:19Z,"ok thank you for clearing that up and i wanted to ask a question do you multiboot and if you do can you give me a rough idea how to im only 12 years old but im very computer knowhow i know how to build a computer what all the specs mean i was currntly trying to run mac 0sx tiger n like a multi boot i am donloading the thing where you copy the files and there but i dont want to completly  install just wanted to multiboot  i know like acronis disk director but every timee i try that i brek my cpmputer so if you can help please!!

[T],wacko506,2007-05-23T16:23Z,"ohh and m,y main os on my desktop is windows vista ultimite =-)"
,irontowngeek,2007-05-23T16:55Z,"I'm not really familiar as a user with MAC X.
It is however,Unix based.

Give me a better idea or scenerio on what you
want to try do,and I'll try to answer your question  if I can.

First,try to answer these questions the best you
can.

Are you trying to run Windows or another OS other than in VM ? You want to install to HD.

Did MAC X come with your PC and is it
a full install edition? Can U upgrade from CD.

Does MAC X take up all available space on
HD?

In my home scenerio,i could ""share"" my files
with MAC X thru my Linux Box,using SAMBA.
My Win 2000 has a 50 Gig mapped drive on my
Fedora 6 PC. (to me,it looks local.) I have a
network.

You can send me an email if it is going to be
lenghy.

irontongeek@yahoo.com"
,irontowngeek,2007-05-23T17:10Z,"Your message can while I was answering your
reply.

You will need to get Partition Magic or a 
Partitioning software that will split your 
drive to make room for MAC X.
Partition Magic will split NTFS or FAT 32 
drives.
Once you partition the drive to make 
what ever size you allow,boot to the
MAC X CD and follow the directions to
the letter.
The main thing is to use
""available free space"" in any partitioning
U do in MAC.

The lettering will NOT look like it does in
Windows.
Linux uses;

fd0 for first floppy drive
hda for first hard drive.
hda1,hda2,hda3,etc to represent different
partitions.

You will need to add the MAC X boot loader
in the MBR.

If this message breaks up and is
un-readable,just e-mail and I'll attach a text
file to give you some idea on what to expect.

Regards."
,irontowngeek,2007-05-23T17:20Z,"Yo.Wacko,

Go do a key word search for ""pearPC"" on the
bay,and you will find a program to run
MAC X.
From the discription,it installs directly to
drive C: No partitioning.
(similiar to my WinLinux2003)
I'm going to download myself,just to try out.

U can find it around page 10 to 11 on the
board.
Best of luck to U.


Regards."
[T],wacko506,2007-05-23T20:38Z,"thanks for the tip and ipreciate you tellling me i would very much like to keep contact with you, you let me know you getting on and how i am i will download pearpc and again thanks very much

,irontowngeek,2007-05-24T08:45Z,"Glad I could help some.

Always take the opportunity to learn new
things,even if you ""crash and burn"" a few 
times.
That's how I learned,but there is enough
info posted these days,U can learn more 
than a person should.
I do a little programming now and then,
nothing to speak of,but enough to inspect 
inside a few ""dodgie"" software posted.
Keep a level head playing this ""game"",wish 
you the best in your schooling.

Mind your mama and stay out of the porn
section.
(ha!)

,irontowngeek,2007-05-25T07:34Z,"Yeah,I'm going to post a neat little NAT/Proxy
Server I found on the Web,called ComTunPro.
Beats the hell out of setting up RRAS in Windows.
If your upload gets some attention,I may build
a RAR of some 98 compatible software gathering
dust.
Hell,I may go ahead and do it anyway.

If anyone is interested in ComTunPro before
hand its;

www.linkbyte.com

Rates real high with me :>)

,irontowngeek,2007-05-25T07:37Z,"Oh,yeah,I had downloaded this version of 98
before hand and I was going to re-seed but it
was deleted from my bucket.
I re-downloaded it so I will seed it for you.

Cheers"

             Jack Docherty"
,irontowngeek,2007-05-27T15:48Z,"I think anyone who hasn't used Win2000,should
download it.
It was the only Windows version I liked till I became a Linux user.
I have been out of the loop.finishing up a 
dedicated server just for seeding.
It runs 2000 Advanced Server,even though
I have 2003.
I can add my own ""goodies"" without"" having to
disable all of Microsoft's B.S.

Yo,wacko....
What's VPC like? I have *.iso.
Was thinking about installing.
I installed PEARPC and it was different,to say
the least.

Regards."
[T],wacko506,2007-05-28T02:28Z,"virtual PC for the comp is great you can pretty much run any microsoft os and any linux (i Think) not sure bout the intel macs if you have intel processor umm if you got at least 512MB of Ram and wont be running any really big os then go for it but if you have 1 gig your set for life its very user friendly easy to use so give it ago heres the link

[T],wacko506,2007-06-29T14:51Z,"Ok Whats the problem? what happens when you choose, capture iso does it not boot or did you burn it to a cd and use that? tell me what you done nd what happens"

[T],wacko506,2007-06-30T14:37Z,"im not too sure, the only thing i can think of is, you need to make a VHD Named windows 98 and where you select what os you will be doing click that windows98, the last thing mybe when you start the virtual machine tap del go into the virtual bios and check tha its set too first boot priority cd rom i dono try that if that dont work then i dont know."

,Placebonaut,2007-10-03T18:12Z,Isn't it ironic that .uif stands for UNIVERSAL image format? I wanted this for Virtual PC on my mac. Should've checked the file extension first! Now I have to download another windows os so I can put MagicISO on it and unzip this.
