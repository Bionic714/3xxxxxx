Synopsis
Clint Eastwood?s second film as a director (following the highly successful Play Misty For Me), High Plains Drifter returns the actor to his familiar role of ?The Man With No Name.? Eastwood portrays a mysterious stranger who emerges out of the heat waves of the desert and rides into the guilt-ridden town of Lago. After committing three murders and one rape in the first 20 minutes, The Stranger is hired by the town to protect it from three gunmen just out of jail. The Stranger then paints the entire town bright red, renames it ?Hell,? and supplies Divine retribution in a fiery climax.
