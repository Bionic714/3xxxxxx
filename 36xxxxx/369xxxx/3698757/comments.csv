I have been looking for a no cd crack for this game but cant find a working link to get it.

Can you upload it seperately please, or have a working link where to get it?

Thankyou"

,FireFoxConn,2007-07-04T19:05Z,Will seed as soon as possible for as long as possible but this looks really cool thanks! i am using bitlord and all u do is open the .rar file in the downloads folder of bitlord and unpack it... than use a program like alcohol 120% to burn the .iso image to a cd and enjoy!
,Rothjet,2007-07-06T00:35Z,"SecretName:
If you do have the show on your pc, put them up, you would be a godsend to me if you do.
Robot Wars series is nowhere to be found on the internet."
,Hoiafar,2007-07-07T13:24Z,WTF! it takes 1-15 days days to download!
,DevilboyScooby,2007-07-10T10:33Z,FireFoxConn: you don't have to burn it. you could use ISOBuster etc to extract the files!

,RobotCombatFan,2009-04-01T14:03Z,"Hope this isn't dead...
-I downloaded the torrent.
-Used PowerISO to Mount ""RWED.iso"". The part 1-18s just have the same contents as the iso, so I didn't do anything to them.
-I right click on disk drive where PowerISO Mounted, I press Autoplay.
-For a millisecond, a window tab thing saying ""BBC"" comes up at the bottom (like it was minimized) and then nothing happens.

I have no crack, and I used PowerISO and WinRAR. Nothing happened with Daemon either. The description wasn't very detailed...

P.S. Love your YouTube videos."
,PcConquerer1399,2009-04-01T23:04Z,"okay guys, works FINE!!!
only problem i have is how to use my weapons on my bot :-P

OKAy!!!
FIRST @Torrentmaster
explore your cd and find the setup app

Go into compatibility mode and hit xp service pack 2 ;)

@ robotcombatfan


Just use winrar or 7zip to extract your Virtual

then use Daemon or Virtual iso to mount it and install it

ONCE DONE with that, just go into the cd itself and find the crack and copy it onto the original .exe 


HELP DESK Issues-RESOLVED :)"
,RobotCombatFan,2009-04-02T00:56Z,"FAILED! More detail please. I tried to follow your instructions:

-Used WinRAR and opened RWED.iso and extracted to some random folder.
-Used Daemon (Lite) to mount RWED.iso...nothing came up...

Grr...! >:P"
,RobotCombatFan,2009-04-02T01:11Z,"Also, when I press ""Extract to..."" on WinRAR for the iso, the place I extracted to is containing all the files that are in the iso. I don't think that's supposed to happen. "
,RobotCombatFan,2009-04-02T03:01Z,"I figured it out by myself! I will post it for reference:

-Once the torrent is downloaded, open it.
-Now you need to download WinRAR and Daemon Tools Lite.
-Open ""RWED.part01"" (or any other partX) with WinRAR.
-Click ""Extract to..."" and extract to a random location where you can find it.
-Click on Daemon Tools icon, and mount the file you extracted in the previous step. (RWED, not the one you extracted from, e.g. RWED.part01)
-:D

But now it tells me to insert the disc! What do I do? Just joking, I'll go look for a crack."

,Dean0692,2010-09-03T01:37Z,"Can someone help me please, I have mounted the image with daemon tools and have downloaded the no CD crack but I don't know what I'm meant to do with it.

,jayjay5396,2011-01-13T12:05Z,its asking for the cd grrrr i was looking forward to this game too
,hammerheadieaglethrust,2011-03-18T15:01Z,thanks a lot!
,joebro1995,2011-09-27T10:23Z,"What the hell. Ok so it installs successfully, then it tells me wrong disk inserted."
,jordanidk,2012-03-30T19:36Z,"There is a crack included guys. Explore the ISO and go to the folder named deviance or whatever. You'll find a rar file. Extract and copy the files in that folder to the install directory. This is the CD crack and it'll stop asking for a disc.

There's one small problem with this. The cracked EXE is detected as a trojan. Obviously everyone knows there's false positives everywhere. Just a heads up and a guide on how to find the crack. Use it at your own risk."
,jordanidk,2012-03-30T19:42Z,"The virus total report:

https://www.virustotal.com/file/65a2d4ead0f02926a611d79a29a61fc7a6be01366e75a061259c1c255091884b/analysis/1333129198/

Personally I'd say it's most certainly just a false positive, of course if it isn't then a virus is easier to remove for some people than others. This might change your opinion on if it's worth the risk of using it."

,funkAdub3,2012-08-13T02:57Z,"Game works perfectly... I'm using Win7 and MagicDisc to mount.  Mount it, and if no auto-run, open up windows explorer and run setup inside the cd yourself.  Also, the crack is inside one of the folders of the cd.   When installing & the directx error occurs, Ctl+Alt+Del and stop the setup, it's already done and fully installed.  Then crack it and you are ready to go!!  Use arrow keys to drive, right shift for main weapon, and right control for secondary weapon.  Hope this helps any who were having trouble.  Two thumbs up uploader"
