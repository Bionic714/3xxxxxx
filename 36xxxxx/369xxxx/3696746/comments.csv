,Gloworm4658,2007-09-23T00:12Z,read me file says it's messed up and unless you have a phd in file editing don't try.  Couldn't ever get it to work even after my husband with the phd worked on it.
,coldtear,2007-09-30T10:34Z,"I guess that such advanced techniques and concepts like ""drag & drop"" and renaming files aren't required for getting a phd :))"

,sp3tan,2008-05-31T23:52Z,"OMFG FUCKING NOOB U ARE DANNE0047CS! GOSH! heres a lil fucking GUIDE for FUCKING NOOBS who NEVER tried TO search WITH ur FUCKING FRIEND, GOOGLE.COM

1. First u get Daemon tools wich u can get by this torrent ( PRO's really recommended cause its the best yup ) http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3979578/DAEMON_Tools_Pro_ADVANCED_v4.10.Build218.0

2. When uve downloaded it, install the shit and when its installed the way it has to be installed. then u press on Tools ( top in the window of daemon tools ) then press ADD SCSI VIRTUAL DRIVE to make another cd drive reader.

3. As u can see u added another Driver. U can find the drivers down bottom thats named like [4:0 - SCSI] (E:) ( u may have it named another way but dont care about it cause its the same ) now right click it and press MOUNT IMAGE and then you search for the file Yu-Gi-Oh! Yugi The Destiny.nrg ( wich is 212 MB big ) and press it twice and tada -.- u have it now mounted in the SCSI driver and install it.
 ( ACtually for fuck sake i havnt yet now downloaded it but im sure its like it ... )

4. When its installed and u want to play it it wont say '' Wrong disc '' or put the correct disc bla bla bla shit ( fuck off )

5. PLAY and ENJOY T3h shit (: ... 

6. Hope u got this shitty little guide ...

( 7. uhm lol if u didnt get it just ask for help but if not nicely u did not wannaget help -.- ) "

,king1803,2008-07-06T10:53Z,for some reason when i try to rename the crack it tells me that yugo_pc.exe cannot be renamed yugi_pc.exe why is that?
,StriFey,2008-07-16T11:27Z,"I downloaded all 3 games in one rar file, now is Yugi The Destiny in italian, while others are in english. And too bad that the game sometime crashes after a battle. For some reason I think it's not really happy with Windows XP. Is Compatibility Mode helpful to stop the crashes??"
,dovydasss,2008-08-06T08:53Z,"Hello, i cannot rename and copy crack to the direction, they say ""Cannot copy yugo_pc: Files on this CD ROM drive are read-only. You cannot copy or move files over to this CD ROM drive. Why is that? what i need to do?"

,gkaroom,2011-05-25T19:50Z,"i was afraid of downloading cuz of the comments, but in the end i did, nd guess wat? single duel works, match duel works, nd no problems with the deck construction.. the only problem is that it doesnt fit my screen and that yugi is a cheating douche .. other than that, it's perfect!
mount, copy&paste, rename.. hope this doesnt ruin my AS & A levels. LoL(y) X)"
