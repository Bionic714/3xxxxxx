George Dennis Carlin (born May 12, 1937 in New York, New York)[2] is a Grammy-winning American stand-up comedian, actor, and author.

Carlin is especially noted for his irreverent attitude and his observations on language, psychology, 
and religion along with many taboo subjects. In fact, Carlin and his \"Seven Dirty Words\" 
comedy routine were central to the 1978 U.S. Supreme Court case F.C.C. v. Pacifica Foundation, 
in which a narrow 5-4 decision by the justices affirmed the government\'s right to regulate Carlin\'s act on the public airwaves.

George Carlin\'s most recent stand up routines are primarily focused on attacking the flaws in modern-day America. 
He often takes on contemporary political issues in the United States and satirizes the excesses of American culture.
