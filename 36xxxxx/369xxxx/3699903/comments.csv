,MightyMouse957,2007-08-14T07:15Z,"mswin756:
1. If you're gonna use it for work, you should really buy it...

2. To seed it, just leave it in your torrent list after it's completed for as long as you want to seed"

,dolphins_fanatic,2007-10-06T03:46Z,"Hello Bubbeh,

Well I downloaded & burned to a Memorex cd with Nero 6. Created a set of boot disks & ran through all 4 fine. Windows setup started and went through the format process fine. Then I get the following messages. 

""The following values in the .SIF file used by Setup is corrupted or missing. 

Value 0 on the line in section [SourceDisksFiles] with key ""sp4.cab.""

Setup cannot continue. To quit Setup,Press F3.""

Any ideas as to why this happened? Hope I didn't download this for nothing. :("

[T],GWpirateGW,2008-11-28T18:45Z,"DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS PIECE OF SHIT! we have epic issues with TBP & non seeding torrents. And any torrents that are not being seeded after a certain amount of time needs to be deepsixed. I have not found anyone yet in last 90 days to get this downloaded.  Went uber fast til 99.7% erase the idiots account too.

We are a family of seeders & leechers, but this breaks the unwriten seeder/leecher code, and TPB is becoming a house of half assed torrentz. I will gladly help moderate these trash torrents. Just gimme the power or find me on GalaxyNet Server in #ga or #reincarnation. Look for GW"

,Voldemort14,2012-03-18T01:17Z,"Folks, when the download to the 99.7% in the folder where it will ta be downloaded (in my Downloads folder is in My Documents), copy and paste it on the desktop ... You can then stop the download of sound that you will already have the file and it works ... the 0.3% that is missing does not change anything."
