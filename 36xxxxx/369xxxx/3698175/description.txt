Abaddon (Tony Bray) is the original drummer of Black Metal Gods Venom. He unleashed in 2000 his first solo album "I Am Legion" to the masses, the music was more or less in the style of Industrial Metal. Unfortunately his first attempt at a solo outing was almost universally condemned.

Personally I must say that although this kind of music isn't what I listen to most, there are certain elements about this album I like,  and it actually IS a bit different than other Venom related projects. I especially like the tracks "I Am Legion", "Hollow Voices" and "All Out Of Love".

If you decide to check this album out, then try to have an open mind and dont't expect it to sound anything like Venom. If you do so, it might happen that you will like this album too.
