[T],HDTV CHINA,2007-06-03T11:27Z,6.50 maps
,rperron,2007-06-05T05:34Z,"Thank you for the u/l. I have TT 6.030 (8320)installed on my palm 700wx and it works great. But I can't get it to recognize my USA and Canada map (6.75 1409) How do you get it to recognize new maps? I have tried the following with no luck: 

1. Copied new map to SD card root directory, Navigated to ""Switch Map"" in TT but the map wasn't available. 

2. Edited the ""Current Map"" file to point to the new map directory on the SD Card. Still doesn't see it. 

3. Researched everythere I could fine information to see if this version of TT was compatible with 6.75 maps and they ALL say it is. 


So I am obviously doing something wrong and I need someone smarter than I am to help me. Please help. I leave on vacation in 4 days and really want this to work. Thanks in advance."

I have a Glofiish M700 in WM5. I have installed TT6 and the Western_Europe map from this torrent on a 2Go MicroSD card but I still have activation issues with the key.exe from this torrent and with the one referenced by Tacoboy (http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3719683). Can you help please? I've spent the all night on it and ran out of ideas. I use the manual activation in TT6 and enter the 3 group of 5 char. in upper case and separated by a space."

Yes you do need a BT gps for this application on the jarmin. Its quit easy to set up a connection between the jarmin and a BT gps.. I recommend the GlobalSat BT-338 (http://www.pocketgpsworld.com/bt338.php#_Toc99554375)...
Or upgrade to a device with biult in gps..."
,mostad,2007-10-12T17:52Z,"Great collection, works great! But not with the latest HTC Tytn II (TTN 6.031).

If i install just the maps it wont accept the activation code that the keygen generates and if i install the Navigator software that is on the dvd (6.01) it wont detect the builtin GPS unit! 

Please someone, find a keygen that works with the latest Tomtom Navigator 6 (6.031)"
,laurensbohm,2007-10-23T16:48Z,"Mostad, dit you manage to get it working with the TytnII ? if you dit, could you tell me how?"
,positif,2007-11-28T10:58Z,"Can anyone help me?
i'm trying to install this but what i do not understand is what you mean in the .txt installation file with the .mid files???

i can not find any .mid files on this download.
i can find .cab file for western Europe. but when i look into the .cab file all i can see is a .001 file .002 file ... and so on.

how can i activate the western europe with the keygen thing?

i installed tomtom already but not the western europe map bacause i can not activate it.

any help would be nice.
thanks"

,fotoman21,2008-05-01T17:07Z,"I've just downloaded and installed this program on my HTC TytnII.

No problems with the installing part, however the internal gps module is nog recognized.

the setting for the gps hard & softwareport are a mystery to me.

Is there any way i can get these settings or can anyone tell me what the settings should be?

,fotoman21,2008-05-01T19:36Z,"Correction, the device is a HTC MDA Vario III."
,Mikeeeeeeeee,2008-06-08T20:59Z,"@fotoman21:

try this:

-> start - settings - external gps 
-> set the GPS port to com 0
-> set gps hardware port to none (off)
-> set gps to manage automatically

Then configure your application to the same settings. Worked for me with google maps, i'll update when i get this download!

Thanks for the upload"
