Overview:	In a place where the law can be bought, there emerged a group of strong, righteous men who helped the people in times of need: the 10 Tigers. The Tigers were a force unto themselves, and when evil entered their domain, watch out! They fought as a band of kung fu brothers. Based on the real life stories of these men, the producers used real life kung fu champions such as Larry Lee (Thunder Kick) and Bruce Liang (Little Superman) to play the roles of such notables as Wong Kai Ying the father of the legendary Wong Fei Hung. Fists, kicks, and honor from the first frame to the last! Before the Wu, there were the Tigers!
