WindowBlinds is a program for Microsoft Windows that enables users to change the look and feel of the Windows GUI. By look and feel, we mean literally change the way title bars, push buttons, the Start bar, scrollbars, and nearly every other element of the interface of Windows. These changes are then inherited by the programs running on your system to deliver a consistent look across most of your programs.
