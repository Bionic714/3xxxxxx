A spooky popup window appears after reboot and tells you to disable antivirus/spyware or other safety programs and reinstall the program.

DonÂ´t bother downloading..."
,demss,2007-05-28T13:13Z,Crappy antivirus you must have...
,vajlent,2007-05-29T01:48Z,"Yeah right...
What have the virus program to do with this?"
,demss,2007-05-29T09:37Z,"Well windowblinds is changing system files I think so it can apply the skins (change bars, transparency and all).
Try disabling your antivirus and other software then install the program, crack it as it describes in how to.

Btw I personally have only tested it on XP SP2.
Maybe need to disable that assistant on Vista."
