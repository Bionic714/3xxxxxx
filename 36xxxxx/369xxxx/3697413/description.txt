homage to exploitation B-movie thrillers that combines two feature-length
segments into one double-bill designed to replicate the grind house
theater going experience of the 70s and 80s. In "Planet Terror," a small-town sheriffs' department has to deal with an outbreak of murderous, infected people called "sickos." A gun-legged woman named Cherry (Rose McGowan) and her martial arts-wielding partner (Freddy Rodriguez) take on the zombie army. In "Death Proof," a psycho named Stuntman Mike (Kurt Russell) stalks and kills beautiful women with his car. The two films are fused together by fake movie trailers.

Bruce Willis ... Muldoon (segment "Planet Terror")
Rosario Dawson ... Abernathy (segment "Death Proof")
