,Philophobic,2007-05-23T14:08Z,This is bull-shit. Definitely NOT the uncensored version. Don't download it.
,josef87,2007-05-23T18:54Z,yes it is
,josef87,2007-05-31T19:45Z,"maybe you always played the Uncensored version...
but in the standard version you dont get to see tits and pussy."
,Tiggertea,2007-06-14T21:50Z,"Sorry if i seem dumb, but how do i install it?"
,wyzard,2007-07-13T19:56Z,It sure as hell isn't the uncut and uncensored version.
,selle_mogge,2007-07-15T20:33Z,"A seriously question!
Is this the Uncut and uncensored verison?
Some say yes some say no..?"
,ShizKebab,2007-07-22T10:34Z,Can you play this game with Vista?
,jamsus,2007-07-28T12:13Z,"Thanx josef87 for great torrent.
I was really looking for uncensored version. I trusted u n downloaded this torrent cause u've mentioned twice that it is uncensored version and that's true, it is uncensored version.

Message to all other people THIS IS A UNCUT UNCENSORED VERSION. To Activate Full Nudity you just have Finish the game, then buy the ""Everybody Naked!"" secret from at the bar for 269 Secret Tokens. The ""Nude mode"" option can now be toggled in the ""Extras"" section of the bonus options menu."
,groveahlder,2007-07-30T03:25Z,"Allways the same whith theese ""games"" How the hell do you get them to work! I only get-
""file or directory not found:UI\Global\Text\ENGLISH\Error.AIS""  As I thought Baha Humbug!"

,Wigman47,2007-08-10T21:54Z,"So how do I run this? In the file were 52 .rar documents, I extracted them all and all I got were 4 .mdf files. "
,JolleW,2007-08-11T19:50Z,"Mount them with Deamon-Tools.

I've got a question, I can't hear sound when Larry speak with other people. The mouth is talking but cant hear what they say, kinda hard to play then. What to do? :/"
,Wigman47,2007-08-12T04:38Z,"I tried mounting with both alcohol 120% and Daemon tools, but both times it said ""Please insert original disk instead of backup""
What do I do now?"
,JolleW,2007-08-12T23:18Z,"Oh, I guess that message comes up when you try to start it. First, check ur downloaded torrent. A map named: Crack and Trainer. Guess what? Copy crack and overwrite the old .exe file. Piece of cake. 

Still I got no sound while Larry are talking to chicks. Could anyone tell me if it works for you? Thanks."
,xElixerx,2007-08-14T09:14Z,haha im downloading the whole thing guarranteed at 350 kb/s using download mananger. lol =P

Yeah, about this. It's a feature in the normal version of the game. That's how you get everything uncensored in the normal version."

,apple_juice_82,2007-11-09T18:04Z,So how long does it take to beat the game? or Is there a patch to override that feature? or Is the  toggle feature always in the reg. version and the uncut should be uncensored from the get go?
,mikeywolf,2007-11-21T14:39Z,"This is not the ""uncut and uncensored"" edition."
,Luka20,2007-11-27T18:26Z,this is imposible to extract.. it says that the arhive is corrupted.. does anyone have solution?

,cybear,2007-12-05T23:26Z,"This game is shit. It should not be called Leisure Suit Larry att all, since it is not written by the author of all old Larry games: Comic genius Al Lowe.
Don't download this crap, buy the old games instead! You can get a bundle for like $10-15. "

,Erono,2008-03-25T06:56Z,So can someone tell me if this really is the uncut and uncensored version and if it isn't could someone direct me to one that is?
,dark_justice1986,2008-03-27T20:08Z,This is the Uncut and unscensored version. I got full nudity right at the beginning of the game without even going through it once. Definately without a doubt the version you are looking for folks. Fun game.
,BabelonKing,2008-04-03T01:18Z,"Sorry to burst anyones' bubble, but this game isn't what you'd be expecting compaired to the originals. There isn't much to expect except a few unlocked content not available in the console versions. The only difference is, in my opinion, Barbara Jo's ending (the console version was better), and the censor bar; which is unlocked in this version. But for those with raging hormones, urging to experience this poor excuse of a LSL game, go right ahead and waste your time downloading, otherwise you can download a wholle compilation of the originals. PEACE!"
,AllHailMephistopheles,2008-04-13T22:09Z,"So... I found out that your suppose to put the crack in program files as well...
Yeah, If you want everything unlocked I would recommend downloading this: http://www.gameburnworld.com/dl/dl2.php?file=LeisureSuitLarryMagnaCumLaudeUnlocker.rar

Its just a save game file.... just put it under saved games in program files as well.  "

,craigbrian,2011-09-13T06:49Z,"

(the silent version is all ready activated just DON'T UPDATE IT) after downloading it extract it to your desktop RUN in administrator mode so you get no errors. remember it SILENTLY installs so wait tell the icon appears on the desktop.

then open DAEMON Tools Lite

after opening it go to the ""Add File"" button then go the the detonation you have your Magna Cum Laude Disc 1.mds threw Magna Cum Laude Disc 4.mds

add ALL four of them just select all pf them. it will then ADD them to DAEMON Tools Lite. now that your done that

select Magna Cum Laude Disc 1.mds and click the ""Mount"" button

a window will pop up saying ""Autoplay"" click Run Launch.exe or Run Setup.exe it will then open up a window that will give you the game options select Install.

now at some point during the installation it will ask for disk 2, 3 and 4 DO NOT PANIC and DO NOT close anything just open DAEMON Tools Lite back up. and go the Magna Cum Laude Disc 2.mds and click mount. now the autop lay windows will pop up. just close it

then were the wind say ""Insert Magna Cum Laude Disc 2"" click OK. then two more will pop up. just repeat the steps."
,craigbrian,2011-09-13T06:54Z,"Comment 2
after the installation is complete DO NOT RESTART YET.
go to the detonation were Leisure Suit Larry Uncut and Uncensored installed usually in ""C:\Program Files\VUGames\Leisure Suit Larry - Magna Cum Laude""

delete the ""Larry.exe"" to the RECYCLING BIN ONLY. 

now go to the ""Crack and Trainer"" folder that came with the torrent and open it up. go to ""mo-ll.rar"" and extract ""Larry . e xe to the program destination  were you deleted it before (NOTE you NEED to do this or the game will say its illegally pirated""

now if you don't want to beat the game. you can download a saved file. 
VERY IMPORTANT ""Leisure Suit Larry Uncut and Uncensored is ONLY uncensored after you beat the game so I suggest you download the Saved data read liverpool202 post


the Saved data location is usually in ""C:\Program Files\VUGames\Leisure Suit Larry - Magna Cum Laude\SaveGames""

extract the ""Game 1"" to the folder. 

now one last thing. go back to ""DAEMON Tools Lite"" and make ""Magna Cum Laude Disc 1.mds "" mounted or you will get an error when you start the game

NOW you can restart your computer

NOTE ITS Important you restart the computer. if you don't the game may not function properly. or not work at all.

after you computer restarts just run the game. if you get any errors. please send me a e mail my You Tube account 

and I will make you a video showing how to do ALL THESE steps.

this worked for me on a Windows 7 Ultimate
Thank you. "
