,satoriforsale,2011-02-03T23:12Z,"thanx a lot!
I have combined all 15 episodes you uploaded into one torrent: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6148337
Hope you don't mind, but once you start on this series you don't want just a single episode. As far as mini-series go, it's up there with Shogun and Roots (haven't found a mgood torrent for that one yet), but I'll seed this as long as possible..."
,lorettab,2011-02-08T14:11Z,"THANK YOU!! 
I have been waiting years to watch this again, it is my very fav mini series! I tried others on here but no one is seeding it back, I cant tell you how much i appreciate it. It will take me a couple days to load them all, but I will!
Thanks again, this is great : )"
