Request PSS 757 2006 V1.2"
,ch!no303,2007-05-31T01:54Z,"My God........ppl

Theres 151 downloads and only 3 persons have thanked the sharing. Well, if there's not gonna be any kind of thanking, at least keep seeding when you finish downloading. 

I have the PSS 757 2006, but Im not sure if its v1.2   If I do have that version, I'll share it with no problem.

THANKS FOR THE SEEDING!!!"
