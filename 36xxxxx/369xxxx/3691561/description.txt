This is THE magazine for Windows IT pros (vay back, it started life as 'Windows NT Magazine'). Provides hands-on information for deploying business-critical applications based on Windows NT Server and Workstation. 
The magazine is dedicated to advanced topics on the Windows NT series (NT, 2000, XP and Vista). As the most popular and one of the best operating systems, Windows NT series is incredibly complicated, and this magazine, issue after issue as well as on its cluttered website, gives you lots of detailed information. A lot of the contributors are respected programmers who really know Windows internals. You also get the "inside" view of Microsoft managers and developers from time to time. This is just one incredible resource for expert Windows uers (after all, even an expert still has a lot to learn).
