A nice show although I think there were a BIT too much from their new album "Minutes to Midnight" that I personally dislike... :-(

This is not the entire show, my memory card wouldn't allow it - there are three songs and these are, in my opinion, the highlights of the show :-)

Trivia:
First European gig on their tour kickstarting tonight.

Trivia:
This show was the live premiere of the song "Leave out all the rest" (according to Chester)

Fun facts:
They kept saying they were happy to be back in Copenhagen, but to my knowledge they have never been there before. Sure, they arranged a concert back in 2003 but it was cancelled... Hmmm.. They should really check up on their facts, cause it was a tad embarrasing....but anyways.....
