,DonSlice,2007-05-22T04:32Z,Thank you! Downloading now.
,didago,2007-05-22T04:39Z,"i think its fake the show this week its doble, so the size must be doble too!

Can someone confirm this?"
,Persekarva,2007-05-22T04:40Z,"Thanks, been waiting, but isnt this supposed to be a double episode??? Kinda slow DL though :( ...

Please people, upload more than u download in the beggining and the torrent will catch up to speed much quicker, for everyone. "
,fbanks,2007-05-22T04:43Z,are you sure it's going to be a double? haven't heard anything about that
,crrc,2007-05-22T04:47Z,its not supposed to be double because they showed the first part of the finale last week
,Persekarva,2007-05-22T04:47Z,"TV.com says nothing about it being a double, so i guess this is the real deal....if only there was a decent seed, lol."
,didago,2007-05-22T04:51Z,"ok so this is it??? 

there is no episode 24?

only 23? =("
,CaPolarBear,2007-05-22T04:54Z,"Heroes was a 1 hour episode. No double. ""Volume 1"" finishes, ""Volume 2"" begins and we'll see you next fall..."
,valenbb,2007-05-22T05:02Z,"TV.com originally stated that this was going to be a 2-hr finale, but since then it has changed. Maybe this will only be a 1-hr finale."
,Persekarva,2007-05-22T05:04Z,"Well at this DL speed, i'll know in 24 hours, wtf"
,FryerTuck,2007-05-22T05:10Z,Not fake fellas.. it's worth the wait! Only up'ing at 48KB/s so sorry about that. Enjoy!
,Persekarva,2007-05-22T05:12Z,"If everyone just sets upload to maximum, everyone will benefit from that, including yourself because everybody else does it, get it? :P"
,oldjollysanta,2007-05-22T05:33Z,"if u look at the info and check ur torrent size, its only 349MB so no double episode this time. though i'd just clear that up"
,inneponken,2007-05-22T05:36Z,I'm stuck at 89.7%... and I can't see the seed. There used to be one.
,Kuntox,2007-05-22T05:40Z,FAKE
,bcherry,2007-05-22T05:42Z,"upping at 4 MB/s, I've got 93% done so far..."
,inneponken,2007-05-22T05:42Z,"No, it is definitely the right episode. I've checked the first parts."
,coleix,2007-05-22T05:46Z,2 seeders?? WTF nobody else downloaded this??it would be helpful if someone that downloaded this would say is real and not a fake.
,bcherry,2007-05-22T05:51Z,"This is the right one.  There are over 2000 peers in the swarm, but only one seed.  Everyone else is 95% or less.  The sample is correct.  Give it a few minutes to have more than one seed and it will start going very fast."
,inneponken,2007-05-22T05:51Z,Stuck at 94.4%. Definitely the right episode and I can't see a single seed.
,cepe87,2007-05-22T05:51Z,"come on seed.. have a speed at 0,5kb/s thats sick"
,Chimairo,2007-05-22T05:53Z,"IF ITS THE RIGHT IT SHOULD BE...

,Chimairo,2007-05-22T06:03Z,I'm downloading this from closed private site right now ...and yes its the right ep.... however its NOT a dual ep.
,FryerTuck,2007-05-22T06:10Z,"@Kuntox

,cepe87,2007-05-22T06:21Z,its only 444 min ?
,epletull,2007-05-22T06:30Z,444 min is pretty long for a tv show if you ask me :p

,_thefool,2007-05-22T06:50Z,"First 90% in less than 30 minutes for me. Once I get over the hump of the last 10% ('cos now I'm crawling...), I'll help seed for a few days."

,spaztard,2007-05-22T10:28Z,"Thank you! :D This is the only torrent that I can get to work, the others are too overloaded. Will keep seeding. "
,spaztard,2007-05-22T10:33Z,"Stop whining about the length of the file, the previews in the last show said that there was only one show left, the show before that said that there were only two shoes left  - are you picking up a theme? They never at any stage said anything about a special two hour episode. Heck, TV guide in NZ had an interview with the producer, saying that they weren't making the final two hours long and we are four weeks behind the US and Canada and can screen it pretty much however we like. Why can't you check tv.com instead of being annoying. "
,bobbokrull2006,2007-05-22T11:19Z,Thx! I have been waiting for this one... :D

Yes it is,

if you downloaded  crap for 5 times in a row, the next time you should wait until the eving or someting, then you always know if this is a real deal or not "
