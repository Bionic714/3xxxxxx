Plot:	For the first time ever, the critically-acclaimed kung fu spectacular "Shaolin: Wheel Of Life" has been captured on film, and looks likely to do for kung fu what "Riverdance" did for Irish dancing!

Featuring ordained Buddhist Monks from China's renowned Shaolin Temple and a haunting soundtrack, this specially-filmed production takes you closer than the best seats in the house to witness this incredible theatrical performance.

"Shaolin: Wheel Of Life tells" the inspiring story of how the Monks' loyalty to their Emperor was betrayed, how they were almost destroyed and how five young Monks survived to continue the "Wheel Of Life."

As the legend is told, you will be left gasping in astonishment at the apparently superhuman feats performed by the cast of twenty Monks as they display some of the most unique Kung-Fu ever seen.

Watch in amazement as they are lifted on sharpened spears, break iron bars with their heads, smash concrete blocks while lying between beds of nails and swords, performing handstands on two fingers and splinter wooden staffs against their bodies. Shaolin: Wheel of Life is an outstanding and moving stage show.

Watch and Be Amazed...
