,samtheman11,2007-05-28T14:34Z,who do you think you're foolin man? tiberian sun is a full cd game and there's no way you can shrink 700 mb to 100 mb
,Stardaemon,2007-06-03T17:48Z,"Unless you rip out the videos etc, and use high compression...
But why then the no-cd patch? "
,morphman86,2007-06-15T11:41Z,"It's NOT a full-CD game, it's a DVD game. It takes about 1.3 Gb in it's COMPRESSED form.
This is probably a demo of the game or a total bogus!"
,zhooles,2007-07-08T23:27Z,It's a 2CD game. But this version has no movies/music so there's no reason to play such ripped version.
,ski_in_mqt,2008-02-18T05:36Z,"ive got an old zip file, 108 mb, and its got the entire game. 
it works fine, but i cant play online.
and it also works on vista with no patches."

,binarius,2009-03-27T21:34Z,"I've been ripping games since they came on floppies, and I HAVE personally gotten up to 20:1 compression on some (700 MB down to 35MB), but more likely this is the full version with just the full motion video ripped to save space.

Quit your bitching everyone unless you know what you're talking about.

No reason to play a version without the movies?  How about um.. oh I don't know.. playing the game itself? *facepalm*"
,binarius,2009-03-27T23:14Z,Looks like the sound and music is just fine. Only the movies ripped?  And it's by Razor 1911 as well. Good stuff.
,jgraf91,2011-09-03T08:32Z,"hello, i am just looking to find a key gen. for ts and fs. i have the cd's but the original cases were lost along time ago. if anyone could help with this that would be awesome. thanks in advance."
