Director: Sascha Rice

Starring: Sally Kirkland, Michelle Wolfe, Daniele Ferraro


It's the lesbian movie of your dreams ? cute girls, funny romantic script, beautiful cinematography and great production values!

This colorful whiz-bang movie sends a pair of innocent new-comers: Lou (Michele Wolff) and Sass (foxy DaniĂ¨le Ferraro) into the wild San Francisco lesbian world where they navigate everything from non-monogamy to S/M role-playing, and come to discover their love for each other.

Lou and Sass are performance art partners and best friends who have recently moved to San Francisco. Shy Lou's life turns upside down when she confesses her passion for the outgoing Sass, and they change from roommates to lovers. The path to romantic bliss takes a wide detour, however, when they meet new friends with some rather frisky ideas.
