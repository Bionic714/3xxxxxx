Metallica Live In Stuttgart 970823
113 minutes (15 minutes of Swedish documentary and 98 minutes concert).
EXCELLENT audio & video.

First of all I\'m not a Metallica fan at all.
But I found these among my video tapes and the quality was too good just to throw away.
Lineage: Swedish TV broadcast - Stereo VHS - Maxell HGX Gold E180 tape - Sharp VC-S2000 Super VHS -
TechLink Cables - LG DR7400 Stand Alone DVD-burner - Magic ISO - You.

I had to make an ISO file \'cause that was the only program that would rip the DVD properly.
I burned the ISO copy with Nero and that worked just fine too.

No meny but 5 minutes chapter marks.
