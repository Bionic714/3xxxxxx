,OnyxgrinD,2007-12-27T19:15Z,Where can I find a high quality version of their live performance from 1991 of Ella Megalast Burls Forever. That version is my favorite of the song since seeing it on YouTube. But I've no idea where to start to find a quality rip for the song.
,oestrogen,2008-01-03T10:58Z,"The file named ""Cocteau Twins - The Lion Sleeps Tonight (Club Remix).mp3"" is actually ""At The End (Fierce Ruling Diva Big Room Build Up Tribal Hybrid Mix)"" by iio, and is also tagged as that.

Does anyone know if Cocteau Twins have ever recorded The Lion Sleeps Tonight for real?"
