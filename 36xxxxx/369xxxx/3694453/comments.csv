UnRARed the game win the latest WinRAR, Used the Setup.reg then double clicked on Pandora.exe. Everything went well. In the main Menu, I chose the Single Player Option. OK. Started a new game with the lowest Video Configuration. The first thing i get after starting a new game is a lockpicking minigame, after that a cutscene where Lambert shows Fisher the Video. Then after loading for the first mission the game crashes and shows the following error:-

General protection fault!

Firstly, run the setup.reg to store the registry, then go to the Splinter Cell folder - open OFFLINE folder > SYSTEM folder > SplinterCell2.exe

Then the game should start! If you have problem with game exit, then you should delete pandora.exe and pandora_tomorrow.exe"

Then, by mistake, I deleted filters in ""Detected"" window, when I was just trying to delete one of the filters, and now can't retrieve the file. Gotta re-download and disable Kaspersky. What is this shit attached to SplinterCell2.exe, anyways? Some ""dybalom.eoc"" or something?"
