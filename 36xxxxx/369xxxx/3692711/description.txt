The film is inspired by the life of deaf-and-blind teacher Theresa Chan. It premiered as the Director's Fortnight selection in the 2005 Cannes Film Festival. It was also the official entry from Singapore for the 78th Academy Awards in the foreign-language category. In December 2005, the Academy body disqualified the film on grounds that it was not "foreign" enough as the dialogue is mainly in English. Out of ninety-three minutes, the film only has two and a half minutes of dialogue.

Be with Me is the first film in Singapore to explicitly feature a lesbian relationship.
