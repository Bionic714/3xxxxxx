Following an aborted second effort by the Funky Kings, Jack Tempchin stayed on with Arista Records for one solo record. Recorded at the legendary Fame Studios in Muscle Shoals, Alabama, his 1978 self-titled release is filled with the sort of sweet harmonies, tasteful guitars, mid-tempo country-rock, and confessional ballads that you would expect from an L.A. singer/songwriter in the late '70s. There are also the obligatory references to feeling free, pickup trucks, being down and out, and waiting for payday to roll around. Still, as was the case with his contributions with the Funky Kings, Tempchin is able to pull it off for about four or five songs. Over the course of an entire album, he begins to teeter between clever and clich√©, and self-deprecating and self-pity. If "Fifteen Days Under the Hood" and "Tijuana" (co-written by Tom Waits) are charming and fresh car and bar songs, respectively, "Pick Up Truck" and "Stingaree" are as worn and tired as a set of old retreads. Elsewhere, "She Belonged to You" and "Golden Life" (written with J.D. Souther) are winners when it comes to losing the girl, while "Lifetime Friend" and "Walk Away" are pleasant, if ultimately forgettable. Also included is Tempchin's own version of "Peaceful Easy Feeling," which he wrote for the Eagles in the early '70s. Whereasthe Eagles' recording remains a blueprint for Southern California country-rock, Tempchin's gets weighed down in its own sentiment and syrupy production. This would be Tempchin's last opportunity at a successful solo career, though a connection with Eagle Glenn Frey would spawn several hits for him as a songwriter in the mid-'80s. ~ Brett Hartenbach, All Music Guide
