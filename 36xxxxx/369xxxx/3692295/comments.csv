...Thanks... was looking to find this since a long time....!

Hope many will keep seeding after they completed for an extended time... (like a week or so.....)

,SpringareG7,2007-05-20T16:22Z,Great! 
,R2/D2,2007-05-20T20:04Z,"Thank you for this one, Kronocide, for this trip down memory lane. Can you provide any video facts like resolution and bitrate as well?"
,Kronocide,2007-05-21T01:21Z,"Thanks for the comments. I'm a newbie when it comes to ripping, although I am a seasoned consumer. All I can say is that there is really now discernible difference in quality between the rip and the DVD. It's a TV show from the 70's, remember? :-)

My AGT tells me I used variable bitrate, 128 kps, if that is any help."
,Agrippa,2007-05-21T10:41Z,"You da man Kronocide!  Now if you can provide the series ""Michael Strogoff, Courier of the Czar"" as well, youll be in my evening prayers for many, many years!!!  :-)"
,R2/D2,2007-05-21T15:03Z,"It's alright, Kronocide. I'll download them anyway. Again, thanks. BTW, the 128 kps you referred to is the audio bitrate"
,Kronocide,2007-05-21T16:23Z,"R2/D2: Right! I used Auto Gordian Knot with the standard settings except for the sound quality.

Here's the details that XP reports for the first episode:

Image
Res: 512 x 384

Audio
Bit Rate: 102kbps
Audio Format: MPEG Layer-3

Video
Frame rate: 25 frames/second
Data rate: 122kbps
Video sample size: 12 bit
Video compression: XVID"
,R2/D2,2007-05-21T18:07Z,"Thanks for the info, Kronocide. It looks fine to me except the resolution which could have been a bit higher. The ideal resolution would have been 640x576. But what the heck... it's free stuff ;)"
,R2/D2,2007-05-21T18:12Z,"Sorry, I was wrong about the resolution. It really should be 640x480.

Regards"
,Kronocide,2007-05-21T19:32Z,"Sorry about that, I didn't expect the instructions I followed to actually decrease the resolution. But as I said above, I haven't noticed the difference. And, you could always view it as an incentive for people who really like the series to buy the DVD. :-)"
,R2/D2,2007-05-21T22:12Z,"He, he. Yes I suppose you can see it that way too :) Seriously, though, like you say, I'm sure it's hard to notice the difference if you just watch it ""as it is"". It's when you want to convert it back to DVD it matters, because the converting program ""stretches"" the resolution back to 720x576 (the PAL DVD resolution) and the quality hence suffers. But I want you to know that I absolutely don't want to complain. I just wanted to explain why I mentioned the resolution. I'm glad for the opportunity to go on this old nostalgia trip. "
,R2/D2,2007-05-23T21:33Z,"Kronocide, I've just got the complete series and now I'm wondering if you could rip the subtitles as well and post them here? The cover says it's english subtitles for the hard of hearing included. You would do me a great favour. Thank you very much in advance :)

PS. Of course I still keep seeding, which cannot be said for everyone. At this moment the series has been downloded 30 times (and it must have been quite recently), but there are only 10 seeders. 2 out of 3 are selfish bastards. DS."
,Kronocide,2007-05-24T14:14Z,"R2/D2, I'll see what I can do. :-) Thanks for seeding!"
,Zwergenpaladin,2007-05-29T18:38Z,Thanks! I had almost lost hope to find this gem...

...Thanks... was looking to find The Onedin Line since a long time....!

A real pleasure to watch The Onedin Line first series, and chances for more parts of the The Onedin Line...? "
,R2/D2,2007-06-03T20:11Z,"Kronocide, do you think you can rip and ul the subs - English for the hard of hearing? I really would like to have them, in fact I need them. Thank you.   "
,reichert,2007-06-10T05:20Z,"
...will series 2 follow...?

Would be appreciated very, very much.
"
,kola65,2007-07-21T12:56Z,"A real blast from the past:-)
Just fininshed watching season 1!
Can't wait to see next season, I really hope someone uploads it VERY soon?
Thanks in advance"
,skamfer,2007-12-21T11:34Z,"Thanks for this one Kronocide. I am late dl this one but there is still some movement for this dl.
I live in SE Asia and i only have ADSL (2048/512) so it will probably take some time before finish. There is 10 seeders present but i dl in ""only"" 5-8 Kbps. Everything is ""open"" (port forward etc) so i hope evrybody keep on seeding alot and i'll be seeding alot when i'm finish dl.
How many series/seasons is there, and will the rest be coming our way?
many thanks"
,bijan1351,2008-01-17T22:41Z,"Please kindly inform me , how can I download thease links?"
