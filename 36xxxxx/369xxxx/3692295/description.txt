"THE ONEDIN LINE is the beloved BBC miniseries set against the changing socioeconomic climate of 19th-century England. James Onedin is a poor young skipper in Liverpool who dreams of starting his own shipping business and breaking free from his powerful boss. He buys a ship and marries the former owner's daughter, but it's not all smooth sailing as he contends with a mutinous crew, scheming competitors, an outbreak of disease, and his own wayward sister." --Amazon.com

This series is better than I remembered it, and those sideburns rule OK. Episode details can be found on the cover scan.
