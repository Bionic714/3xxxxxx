Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall left the city and bought an idyllic cottage somewhere among the waving hills and green fields of west Dorset, England. To live of the land. He grows his own vegetables, buys a couple of pigs and chickens (and as the time goes by the livestock expands). He's also a very inventive and passionate cook, and he makes different delicasys to sell on markets, and he hunts and fishes and makes lot of friends... And he must be one of the most sympathetic persons ever to have his own show.

+ It also contains "Pig in a day" a 2hr long instruction video with Hugh and his friend the butcher, on how to turn a pig into dinner.

++ And as a bonus - "A cook on the wildside", Hugh's 10ep long show he made before moving to River cottage, where he cooks what he can find - roadkill, for example.



Please, help me seed it... And enjoy!
