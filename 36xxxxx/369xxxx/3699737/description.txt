Hi All.

This torrent conatins queen's entire discography including all studio albums and live compilations (except Live at the Beeb but that`s really rare). It also includes the 3 CD platinum compilation.

All tracks have file names and directories like this:

~/Queen/%Year - %Album/%Number - %Title [%Artist]

So you can organise your music properly and use a batch renamer to rename or tag the files however you want.

All files are tagged correctly as well. I hate people who have stupid file names and no tags just as much as everybody else does.

Share and enjoy!

Please leave this torrent running for as long as possible after your download has completed. I have a limited upload bandwidth and a couple of hours of your time and make it much faster for everybody!
