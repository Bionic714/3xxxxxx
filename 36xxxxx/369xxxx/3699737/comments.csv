It is very important if you finish downloading this torrent that you leave it seeding until your share ratio is at least 1:1! Doing this doesn't take any extra time or effort on your part but will make speeds faster for everybody else and make this torrent less likely to grind to a halt if I go offline for any reason.

Thanks!
Sam"
,hollaatchaboi,2007-07-16T19:43Z,this is taking ages to downloadguys
,DowTheFish,2007-08-15T04:22Z,Why the fuck can the files only be played in VLC?
,DowTheFish,2007-08-26T23:18Z,This torrent suck. Stupid fuck. Elaking
,ElGreco27,2007-09-16T11:29Z,"These are OGG not mp3.

Rip 'em right or don't bother, dude.

This one can die"
,Personmann87,2007-10-12T20:33Z,.oog is a open source encoder like .flac. until apple gets with the times and places the proper codex in you'll just have to convert them
,Personmann87,2007-10-13T02:58Z,ok guys as an update go to Xiph.org to get the quicktime component enabling .ogg files in qicktime and to a larger extent iTunes. after that in iTunes right or ctrl click the item and select convert to X (the X is the format you import with). this function can also be used to reencode files with high bitrates if you are strapped for space
,fornicar,2008-01-20T22:07Z,common i thought we were pirates. why do you do such a big deal of the fact that the files are ogg? just convert it.
,jonnosmythe,2008-02-12T04:41Z,"ty for the upload Sam, appreciated - & to the whiners, if ya can't convert maybe you should just stick to your mouse & throw your keyboard away hey ;) "
,scatmandoo,2008-02-26T07:48Z,"Its not the fact that we (most anyway) cant convert, the point is why. When and if something comes along that really kicks ass on the mp3 format then change. In the mean time I dont want to have to screw around downloading and then converting so I can start listening, I just want to start listening."
,DowTheFish,2008-03-01T01:34Z,"Yeah for real, convert to .mp3 or even better, .WMA"
,iKs279,2008-03-13T04:19Z,Vorbis has a really higher quality than MP3 or even WMA so stop whining and be grateful..
,Torvido,2008-03-18T16:35Z,"Don't listen to those who say it only can be played in VLC I tried it on Itunes and Windows media player, and it worked without any problems.

enjoy"
,massenz,2008-04-29T21:54Z,"Awesome, dude!

to all the whingers.... Google: ""ogg itunes""
will yield XiphQT (xiph.org's QuickTime component)

Not knowing absoluting anything about xiph, qt, or ogg, it took me less than 10min to be able to happily play OGG on WinMedia and add them to my iTunes library... now, that's not too much of an effort, is it?

far as I'm concerned, sammydee is firmly stuck in the 'great guys' page in my book... the naysayers.... well, ain't worth the ink :-p"
