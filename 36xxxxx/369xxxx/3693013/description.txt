About the book(s) from the cover: 
\\\"One of the greatest work of the imagination of all time\\\", is how critic Andr√© Maurois described Marsel Proust\\\'s Remembrance of Things Past. The novel if filled with wisdom, humour, poetry, philosophy and a psychological observation, and reading it has provided a life-changing experience for countless readers- The printed volumes comprised some three thousand pages, containing over a million and a quarter words, and Naxos\\\'s abridged recording provides a welcome introduction to the author?s magical world. This box set includes a specially written audio-biography which traces the origin of many of the book\\\'s fictional places, characters and situations.  

According to the Guinness Book of World Records the world\\\'s longest novel is A La Recherche Du Temps Perdu (Searching For Lost Time) and was written by Marcel Proust (1871-1922). The work consists of 13 volumes and contains 9,609,000 characters, with each letter and space counting as one character.
