When Pink Floyd founder Syd Barrett died last July at age 60, there was talk that he had lived in poverty, but that turns out not to have been the case. Barrett left behind an estate that's been valued at over $3.3 million, according to documents which were released a few days ago in the U.K. Barrett's will divided the money among his siblings, with his brother Alan getting more than $825,000, while his sisters Rosemary and Ruth and another brother named Donald each got over a half million dollars.

Rosemary -- who cared for Syd in the later part of his life -- was also given the money from the sale of Syd's house and an auction of his belongings, which totaled up to almost $850,000.

Syd Barrett had been a co-founder of Pink Floyd in the mid-1960s. He was the band's original songwriter and lead singer, contributing to two albums before overuse of drugs led him to his departure from the group. He maintained a brief solo career before slipping from public view, staying at his Cambridge home and becoming a recluse and an artist. He died July 7th, at the age of 60.
