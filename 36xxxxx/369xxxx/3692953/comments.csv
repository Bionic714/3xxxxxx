,*Dark *M,2007-05-21T12:21Z,"hi!
would i be need to burn the image file up to disc for installation?"
,soulbringer1,2007-05-21T15:50Z,yeah the prupose of image files is that you can burn them to disc's and if you want to make a clean install then you must burn the image file 
,Reflector2000,2007-05-21T18:23Z,"I have tried to burn an ""iso-file"" into a DVD, but it does´nt work! When the procedure is finished, it will not be shoed on the DVD and the DVD is damaged for further use.  People are talking about image files etc. 

I am using Nero - any idea how to burn an iso-file to a DVD?"
,joeybhoy,2007-05-21T18:54Z,"@Reflector2000   If you are going to use nero then close the NEW COMPILATION window and hit the tab RECORDER, then select BURN IMAGE from the drop down box. then navigate to the xp image and hit burn.
b.t.w. my opinion is to use a prog called ImgBurn. you can get it here  http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3617887/ImgBurn_2.2.0.0
and 1 more thing the file is 700 megs so it should fit on a cd. maybe you should activate overburn function in nero, but if I were you download ImgBurn and use that for all your image files"
,joeybhoy,2007-05-21T18:55Z,"oh and 1 more thing, thanks to the uploader he he he. should have said that in the post above"
,Reflector2000,2007-05-21T19:13Z,"I have tried 9 times now..   what a waste of DVD´s  :-(     One DVD has been wasted by using ImgBurn.  Wondering whats wrong. I will download the file again and see.

Thanks for your comments though..."
,Liquidhead,2007-05-21T20:35Z,"'reflector2000' it wont write 2 dvd, it has 2 b a cd to boot from, nero should work or download ultra iso, ok."
,Reflector2000,2007-05-21T20:49Z,"Now it works !!   When the burning process was ready, the CD was empty..  but after a verification process, everything showed up!

Thanks folks!!"
,philip1792,2007-05-21T21:35Z,"Ok, so say i wanted to reformat my hard drive, could i use this disk to do that, and what about activating it? what do i do for that?

Thanks for your help and great upload :)"
,joeybhoy,2007-05-21T23:29Z,"use the overburn function in your burning app, if it doent fit. I just finninshed Dl so ahl post back any problems Lol"
,joeybhoy,2007-05-21T23:39Z,there should be no problems burning with ImgBurn went ok on my system. 
,*Dark *M,2007-05-22T01:10Z,"ohh shit my driver is fucked up!!! i can't burn shit...
what should i do?"
,soulbringer1,2007-05-22T02:14Z,"Reflector2000 . Mount the image using Deamontools or Alcohol 120% , burn using copy CD function , i used Ahead Nero on a 700mb disc, both this computor , my server and my laptop runs on this OS that im providing. Hope it work this time

,soulbringer1,2007-05-25T02:52Z,"i don't know why ashwani  is interfering / advertising

for  personal intress my release is a clean install dont need to do anything to it while his needs activation crack ... also i got plenty of seeders exept myself, 

my meaning with this torrent is that i want do distrubute a superb clean installation . not all out here is talented  , so why not keep it simple ? 

thx for choosing my torrent i hope it suit you well ! "
,mrneil22,2007-05-25T04:03Z,"Umm... soulbringer, is there a reason why this installation did not install drivers for my ethernet controller, nor does it contain options for standby or hibernate?

Is anyone else having either of these problems?"

,soulbringer1,2007-05-25T18:15Z,"mrneil22 - i havent had any problems with my Ethernet controller, dunno why you get it :/ otherwise try to intstall them manualy from the cd 
hope you the best luck

Shashank Mishra - do you get windows validation issues ?? then what have you done ? 

still it stands in the info at the top of this page that it is SP2 , And there is the usuall instalation files nothing eddited ,Direct X 9.0C, WMP 11 , dont know wh yyou are posting not to download this torrent.

plz come with questions instead of acumiliations
cheers all"
,mrneil22,2007-05-26T02:25Z,"Okay, ethernet is fine, but still NO option for standby or hibernate anywhere.  So far I can't find a way to install these manually.  I also tried this version of XP:  
http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3600147/Win_XP_Pro_-_clean__amp__validates
and got the same result!  No standby, no hibernate.  What am I doing wrong?  Can anyone help?"
,mrneil22,2007-05-26T16:13Z,"Figured out why standby and hibernate were greyed out after installation... apparently this is a common problem, so I thought I'd post for anyone having the same difficulty...

Windows will prevent you from using standby or hibernate if your video or cardbus drivers are not the manufacturer's.  If you're using Windows' regular old ""Standard VGA"" then you will probably run into this problem.  I was able to download all the proper drivers from the manufacturer's website (in my case, Winbook Corp)."
,mrneil22,2007-05-26T16:16Z,"Oh, and by the way, don't listen to anyone telling you not to download this, this is one of the best XP torrents I've been able to find.  The validation key works great, it's a very up-to-date SP2, everything works fine now that I know what I'm doing.

Now off to my mac to use this with boot camp!  Thanks soulbringer!"
,soulbringer1,2007-05-26T17:28Z,"Ok the torrent is sprinting towards 500 downloads , plz notify me if you got any probs , and plz send some comments about it . this upload is for the people! share youre knowledge to help others!

,mrneil22,2007-05-27T02:23Z,"@ crocodillo:

You will probably need to convert the .bin file to a .iso file before you can burn it.  I did this on XP so I don't know which program you can use for free on a Mac, but there should be plenty.  Just look for something that can ""convert a bin/cue image to an ISO"" and also something that can ""burn a CD from an ISO image.""

When I made the conversion, the file shrunk from 703 MB down to 612 MB -- plenty of space on a standard CD-R to fit.  Hope this helps."
,gregglol,2007-05-28T09:32Z,"I just downloaded this and rebooted from my pc. I chose to install it over my vista, and so far everything is ok. Meanwhile the installation thing with the bluescreen in the background is going, i get some errors that it cant find surtent files. I get the choose between hitting enter to try find them, or esc to skip them. Eventually i just have to skip them, because it cant find them when i hit enter. When that installation is done, the pc reboot, and the blue windows xp installation witch says approx 39 min left appears. Then an error comes and tells me it cant find a file or something and twhen i klick og the pc just reboot and the same happends next time. What is wrong? "

,nillohit,2007-05-29T16:48Z,"hi guys, i downloaded this xp version, since it is larger the 700 mb, to accomodate it in CD, i have converted the .bin files to .iso file and it has shrunk to 612 mb but can anyone tell me what to do with the .cue files? "
,nillohit,2007-05-29T17:02Z,"continuation of my last comment, i wanna know after converting the .bin file to .iso file, i have one .cue file left.  Now using PowerISO, i can burn the .iso file to the cd, directly but what to do with the .cue file, can it be left ? pls help"
,soulbringer1,2007-05-30T02:58Z,"nillohit 

im not 100% about the ISO / BIN /CUE stuff but i have a faint memory about that the CUE file is the directory name and properties for the BIN file 

as i know you can mount both the bin file and the cue file and still get the same result . so i think that the CUE file isent really nessecary when you have converted to a ISO 

so ... SHOT :P"
,nillohit,2007-05-30T10:46Z,"soulbringer1

u r right.  it is not needed at all while burning, only .bin converted to .iso image needs to be burnt on the CD.  By the way, ur version works great, and i will advise every one in need of bootable xp sp2, u can grab it without giving it a second thought and pls pls pls dont pay any attention to Sashank Misra's words, i dont know what the hell is trying to convince, so he is not worth any mention here. Again SOULBRINGER1, u version is great, thanks for uploading it

,HateMachine,2007-06-02T00:09Z,Dude - everybody who's DL this has used that SN; naturally M$ blocks it...  The trick is not to use the update website - instead activate Automatic Updates under Control Panel - that way you can still get an updated system...  And remember to get an WGA crack before activating automatic updates...

This dl is working great for me as a dual-boot Win2k/XP set-up (once I finally got around the fact that my older Compaq didn't want to process the boot after checking ssytem hardware for compatibility - had to install from the XP menu while running 2k).

First i used magicIso, which totally didnt work, then I tried Imgburn.
I selected the Iso file to be burned with Imgburn, and eveyrthing went ok, until I noticed the Iso file was converted to a Bin file on the burned cd!

So shall I try burn the Bin file to make it become a bootable cd, or does the bin file on cd work like a boot file?

Ty for your help."

I burned 2 samples of the bin file, and on very slow speed to avoid any errors with the burning, i verified both cds in Imgburn and came out 100% good.

When i try to install i get an error message says one file is missing ""ayw3dztt.sys"" on both samples."
