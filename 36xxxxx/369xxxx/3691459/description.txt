Micatone - Is You Is (2003)

This is one very smooth, sophisticated, and great sounding album. Superbly crafted, with a perfect balance of quality musicianship, vocal talent, and modern programming. It just signals sheer class from the first listening, and does not wear thin over repeated plays.

If you like nujazz, then treat yourself to this. It has a smokey, oily and slightly disheveled flavour to it, mixed with a very contemporary vibe. Coming from the Sonar Kollectiv stable, you know its going to be good, but this has got to be one of their real jewels.


Micatone are:

Lisa Bassenge - vocal:

Lisa Bassenge is 30 years old; she has her own jazz trio where you can also hear Paul Kleber on upright bass. In 2004 they recorded their third critically acclaimed album \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"three\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". Lisa Bassenge is also singing with the german band \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"nylon\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".
Paul Kleber - bass, percussion:

Boris Meinhold - guitar, electronics:
