,420dopeman,2007-05-21T17:31Z,lol
,420dopeman,2007-05-21T18:15Z,"Ailuro, since im in a good mood, just celebrated my favorite time of day, allow me to feed you some knowledge, perhaps helpful in your overall successsful pursuit of PC use.
 Hmmm, Well the nfo states, you must use the latest winrar, so lets start there, that would be winrar 3.62 or above. If you do not use this version, you will occur the error of which you speak... 
And moving on, 'every file' is broke. Now , this one I like, so that must mean the other whole '2' files must be broke as well. So the nfo is broke and the html link is broke also, well I'm afraid I cant help you there, perhaps I could suggest an excellent course of PC for Dummies if you would like, or there's also a couple of good books on the subject also.

cheers matey.

,NO_BS,2007-09-09T05:22Z,"Anyone know if there is a v.102 fix for this? The 1.02 patch improves the graphics, sound, and a couple of other things, but I can't find a no-cd anywhere. Thanks in advance.

Actually, hold on- I'll just throw the patch on and see if it works...
"
,NO_BS,2007-09-09T05:28Z,"Yes, it works. Get the patch, it's worth it.

Rest in peace, Richard Burns..."
,NO_BS,2007-09-11T07:01Z,"Ok, I had to come back and say this:

This is the most amazing rally game I have ever played... Probably the best racing game period. 

I've played and beat MANY rally sims, and thought I knew the ropes, but this game is far superior to any other. No flooring it non-stop around corners, magically sticking to the ground at impossible speeds, no matter how good you are. This requires smooth, sensible handling and alot of throttle, steering, and brake work. The basics are the same- only magnified to realistic levels. In places, it can take 8 to 10 seconds to slow your car to an appropriate speed for hairpin corners without losing control.

Colin McRae Rally is overrated. This game has very, very realistic physics and requires you to use your brain. Traction, speed, momentum, and road conditions all come into play beautifully. When you complete rallies, you feel a sense of achievement far greater than any other game will give you... 

The terrain graphics are beautiful, far better than most other high-profile games. I believe they are even better than DiRT, if you like contrast and realism, not flashy, system-hogging, unnecessary makeup. The visuals in this game do the job very well, with ease.

RBR is an A+, first class sim, all the way. Excellent. If Warthog was still in business, and Richard Burns was still alive (God rest his soul) I would hunt down a copy and buy it, to give the respect that the developers deserve.

A big THANK YOU to dopeman. You struck gold with this one, mate!

,Guba,2007-09-14T20:17Z,"thanks dopeman i'm loving this sim! can't beleive i missed it when it was released. i have one question tho. any one know how to get the 1.02 patch to install. i want to be able to update it and installs mods but i need 1.02 for that. everytime i try to patch it says ""RBR needs to be installed before running this patch"" i added the path in the reg file then added it to registry but no luck. guess it's with it being a rip. i  need some way into to making it think it's been installed using the installer. any one have any ideas? thanks in advance"
,Guba,2007-09-14T20:31Z,ignore my last post. i deleted the path i edited in the reg file. i should of never edited the reg file to begin with. now i added it to registry again and patch installs fine. btw any one who doesn't know you don't need a nocd for v1.01 or 1.02. both patches remove the protection :) cheerz dopeman best game i downloaded in a long time. kinda hard to do a rally with a joint in ya gob tho :P
,De SE,2007-09-18T16:12Z,"When I start the game I only get a black screen, with my taskbar still showing. Frozen.
Can't do anything but turn the PC off to restart it.

Anyone know how this can be solved?"

Maybe too difficult for most people. U definitely need a steering wheel / gamepad.

,Blacker73,2009-01-31T02:11Z,"Hey gents,

For those of you having issues -- This is by far the best and most realistic rally game ever produced, there are, however, some pretty strange issues. I have had the issue with the patch, windshield, FF w/G25. Just keep working through them, check forums, it's worth it.

I am interested in knowing if this version would work online... I have the game myself, but my friend wants to try it out and he uhhh sucks at racing, so I have to help him along. Any thoughts gents?"
,Warewolf79,2009-02-09T14:39Z,Thanks!! YOU ARE THE KING!!!! Really man THANKS!!! i like the way you do it! no crack or other shit!! THANKS! keep it going man! and one more time:D THANKS!!

,IbarcodeI,2009-03-21T07:54Z,"Cheers Dopeman, wicked torrent!

@ Blacker73

I've updated to 1.02 no problem, don't see why you couldn't install multiplayer mod/patch. However, having problems getting G25 FF to work (on xp, NOT vista), any ideas?

@ everyone who can't start game - unzip .rar file with latest version of winrar to c:\program files, then go into c:\..\richard burns rally and double click the file ""setup.reg"" then run game. If you're running a widescreen monitor open the richardburnsrally.ini file and input your monitors native resolution beside where is says ""xres"" and ""yres"" - eg. xres 1920 yres 1080"

Controls, force feedback sound and just about everything works. Except one thing. I was heading over to the Rally School in the game, the first stage worked fine, but then, at the second stage, everything just crashed. I don't seem to be able to fix the problem and wonder if someone else has the same problem. And ofcourse, is there any fix?
Since I suck at driving i would find the Rally School pretty fun, so please help me if you can.
Thanks a bunch."

,Jimbobtx3,2012-01-21T14:02Z,"Hi folks, 

Ok, I see a lot about problems installing patch 1.02 with this rip, but could someone, in clear english, explain to me what I need to do to have patch 1.02 install over this rip. 

1. I've searched every forum for an answer
2. I've installed to C:\RBR
3. I've modified the registry installpath to point to c:\RBR directory
4. I've tried default install path
5. I've ripped by hair out, spat on my cat and thought about female masturbation. All didn't help

Windows 7 64 - somehow I'm thinknig this is the reason.
I get 'RBR must be installed to install patch' error

thank you"
,sirius739,2012-02-06T15:24Z,Jimbobtx3: Did you edit the .reg file to point to c:\RBR or locate the InstallPath in the registry and change it manually?
