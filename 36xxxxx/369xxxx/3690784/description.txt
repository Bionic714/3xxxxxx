Moonlight Sword and Jade Lion (1981) - REMASTERED

Plot:	Angela Mao stars in this odd pseudo-mystery, as a student trying to track down her master's missing friend. She must make her way through a web of lies, misdirections, and assassination attempts to uncover the truth.

Overview:	Angela Mao, the original Deadly China Doll, stars in an action-packed adventure of rebellions and overthrows during the Sung Dynasty.

Thrill as martial arts experts, both male and female, square off for a fight to the death to divide the eventual ruler of the China Dynasties.

A non-stop story of loyalty, bravery, and patriotism! This is the fourth film in Crash Cinema's Shaolin Boxer Collection.
