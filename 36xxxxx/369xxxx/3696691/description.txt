TV documentary by Richard Smith. Fantastic computer graphics, bringing paleoclimate alive. Ancient oceans went stagnant and toxic during previous episodes of global warming - at that time because of too many volcanoes belching gas. These were the times when the bulk of Earth\'s oil reserves were created in black slimy ocean sediments.

There is an amazing interview list of qualified geophysicists all saying the same message: melt the polar ice caps with man-made warming, and you will again have toxic stagnant oceans for about 250,000 years, as this the only way the planet knows to \"rapidly\" re-absorb all that SH!T we are pumping into our skies. 

World premiere on Australian national TV 24th May 2007.
