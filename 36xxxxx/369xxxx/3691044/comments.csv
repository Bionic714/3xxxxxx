Use alternatives. "
,Menno2,2007-07-20T15:46Z,"> The keygen is infected with malware dont use it!
No, your antivir application is infected by a blacklist  from M$ and other companies. They have a deal with these antivir manufactors to put cracks and keygens in blacklist and report as malware, regardless that progs makes serious issues or not."
,Lolnooblet,2007-07-20T20:18Z,"Yea, I believe you because a majority of anti v said it was a 'possible threat', and didnt specify  what it actually did.

Anyways, thanks alot for the game it works great!"
,Lolnooblet,2007-07-21T02:15Z,"Heres some help for installing.
STEP 1
============
 > Unzip the ISO file
============

-you will get a folder with a CD1 image, and CD2 image)

STEP 2
===============================
> Run a program such as Alcohol 120%
> Mount the CD1 image on the virtual drive.
> Run the installation
===============================

STEP 3
===============================
> When prompted for CD2, remove whatever is on the virtual drive, and add the CD2 image onto the virtual drive, and press OK.
==============================="
,Lolnooblet,2007-07-21T02:16Z,"You can do it other ways, but thats how I did it.

If your Keygen isnt working try these Serials:

W3QG-WLU9-G85Z-2KHL-RLD0

WLRH-PBZ3-Q25Y-9UNA-RLD0

MZK3-S5K4-QGH4-CE8B-RLD0

VXDM-X85X-V2HA-TGAR-RLD0

They should work."

,Menno2,2007-07-23T18:55Z,"> is there any way to add custom music?
Sorry, I've found those tool (Music Importer) only for UG1. I don't know that's work for UG2.
But, there's a easier way: turn off the music volume (or switch off all tracks) in game and run winamp simultaneous. ;)"

,Menno2,2007-08-08T15:41Z,"> i have extract all RAR-archives
All? There exist only ONE archive!
> Now i just have two folders whit some files
Two folders? The archive contains NO folders! Just only 3 files: ""install.txt"", ""Need for Speed - Underground 2 [v1.2 PC-Multilang NoCD] - CD1.iso"" and ""Need for Speed - Underground 2 [v1.2 PC-Multilang NoCD] - CD2.iso""."
,Menno2,2007-08-08T15:46Z,"> IT SAYS PLEASE PUT IN THE CORRECT CD ROM THE 1ST ONE WORKED OK BUT THE 2ND DOES NOT
Then mount the 2nd image in Daemon Tools or create 2 drives in DT and mount both images at each drive."

,Celerod,2007-08-09T14:46Z,"Menno2 i can't mount whole ""Need for Speed - Underground 2 [v1.2 PC-Multilang NoCD] - CD1.iso"" -folder with daemon.. but if thats the .ISO file... HOW I CAN MOUNT IT?????"
,Menno2,2007-08-10T17:30Z,"> but if thats the .ISO file... HOW I CAN MOUNT IT?????
Easy. Just left click on DT-icon in systray. In menue click on ""Device 0"". In appearing fileselectorbox search for the path, where you extract the files. Then click on ISO-file and OK. That's it! Now you have mount the image and can use it like a ""normal"" drive. Of course, you must select this (virtual) drive in Explorer, before you use that contents.
Now, you will ask me, which drive is the right one? Noob, you have seen it before in DT-menue (the drive letter stands after ""Device"" in brackets)! ;)"
