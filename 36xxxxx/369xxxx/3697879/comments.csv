,vinryk,2007-05-27T12:07Z,"Super cool upload. You wouldn't happen to have all works of the great Akira Kurosawa, would you?
I am especially looking for his later works."

Your ignorance is showing."
,brdman2.0,2008-12-22T00:54Z,can anyone tell me how to rip a DVD in it's entirety like this?
,Ohmstar,2009-09-13T20:14Z,Stuck at 99%. Anyone want to help us with the last percent?
,hipsterdufuschick,2009-10-06T22:24Z,"another masterpiece from susanalic! merci, gracias, thank you a thousand times.

@brdman2.0: i'd use DVD Decrypter or its more modern name, IMGBurn. DVD Shrink works too. Just google them, they're all free and easy to use. Good luck!

I'm hoping someone will seed the last 3-4%. I promise to seed a long time if anyone will help us to get that last bit! THANKS in advance. :)"
,theshape31,2010-04-16T02:30Z,"Many thanks for this great upload.

Not many peers left on this one, so any seed help would be very much appreciated.  I will be seeding this long after my download has finished."
,theshape31,2010-04-17T16:58Z,"Finally got this one finished, thanks for all the seed help.  I'll be sharing this release at least 3x over."
,Shakurazz,2011-10-21T10:51Z,"Am I the only one who has a problem playing this DVD? I use VLC that has played everything perfectly for me so far. But this time it LAGS. First, a 10 second menu loading time, then the video stops every 10-15 seconds."
,sinikhil,2012-04-27T00:36Z,Commentary if any ?
