This is a Debian Lenny LIVE cd iso. Yes, a live-cd running Debian Lenny. It took me quite a while to find and download a working iso, and when I did it took a bazillion million years for the silly thing to download... alioth server was running slow that day or just overloaded, don't know don't care. So, here it is so others may get it out there and use it. I have found this to be an excellent repair disk, forensic tool, or just to goof around and be able to have a fully working Debian Lenny up and running on your lamer friend's (who of course runs windows..) machine, have a portable OS that is very secure and leaves no evidence of its existence when you reboot. Apt-get and all the goodness of Debian exist on here.
