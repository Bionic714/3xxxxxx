,Torpor,2007-06-18T16:32Z,Sweet!!! Thnx a bunch!!!
,bob234,2007-06-27T19:55Z,"120 leechers
1 seed
nice....

AND everyone of you leechers have limited your upload speed, stop being tight!!!"
,Fulcrum,2007-06-30T10:58Z,"NaNo Bum, you're a genious!!! But my speed is somewhat slow. Currently at only 1,5 k/bps. This would take me almost a year. If I ever get it done I would seed for a month too keep it going. This is a collective."
,Sattamassagana,2007-07-02T00:47Z,"Do you need all these padding files? I use ?Torrent for my downloading, are the padding files necessary for the playback or can I choose to skip them?"
,wirrew,2007-07-04T21:06Z,pleace seed!!!
,Vantooled,2007-07-09T02:07Z,I had so many connections I had to force limit. It was causing my machine to thrash. Will some of the people who have reached 100% PLEASE seed so we can finish! I am on 83% and have been seeding for over 8 days; this is the most monumental torrent ever; DO NOT LET IT DIE!
,JesusCow,2007-07-11T02:44Z,"thanks, love the few Horizons that i have.. this is great :)"
,catchow58,2007-07-18T15:26Z,"I'm using K torrent, which allows me to download files individually.  Will upload some."
,Fulcrum,2007-07-20T03:22Z,"I've got the whole thing now. I'll keep seeding on and off for a month, then I'd leave it to sombody else to keep the tread alive. "
,xanx,2007-07-21T18:20Z,"Took 2 months for the first seeder to get the whole thing out!!
Help him out now."
,3bord3,2007-07-25T00:36Z,"The big collection of PBS Nova i found here: http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3740123/Nova_105_episodes_48.2_GB
It´s as you might guess about 48 gb big. Nova is the Amercian ""Horizon"". And a few shows is built on the Horizon programs, but with a American twist. Some  better than Horizon and some a pale copy."
,roulduke,2007-09-10T01:00Z,Thanks for this great torrent!
,aehui777,2007-09-21T22:58Z,amazing! please seed
[V],lord_terabyte,2007-10-11T12:17Z,"Please use a client other than BitComet to make your torrents...it is crap anyway and banned on most better trackers, and the padding files make it difficult to reseed...junk on the hard drive that gets deleted...."
[V],lord_terabyte,2007-10-11T12:27Z,"Also 8 MBs is an insane size for the blocks, no wonder it took so long to get this torrent uploaded...1 MB should be the absolute limit for efficient file transfer."
,goransb,2007-10-12T13:23Z,"Well folks today I finally downloaded this masterpiece collection. Took me about two weeks.

I'll keep seeding this during the next weekend, and then... so far my share ratio is 0.9.

Bye..."
,Chryslerdude,2007-10-31T01:12Z,"I wonder why I get such a crap ratio on this nice torrent... DL30 / UL170 very steady for a month, ha ha... Guess I did my share of seeding this... (About 200GB so far ;-) I sure hope I will see the last bit going crossing the finish line.

BTW... Whats up with the damn padding files, oh well.. never mind. I'll look that up myself.

Thanks for a great torrent! Looking forward!"
,orlover,2007-11-02T09:34Z,"super dude .........tell me one thing

Amazing torrent."
,Servo78,2008-04-10T21:20Z,Outstanding torrent. Thanks a lot for these.
,3Cees,2008-04-16T18:46Z,"LOVE Horizon but BitComet is doing things to my PC and driving me crazy.  Have downloaded as many individual ones as i can find but would like to grab the ones i don't have from this torrent.  I noticed some peers were using uTorrent 1.7.7 to download this - is this possible?  Will it work for them?  Do i REALLY HAVE to use BitComet?  What's a padding file?  Why must you have BitComet?  Does uTorrent 1.7.7 work?

thanks as well for the patience and time of whoever uploaded this - 'tis an absolute treat..."
,llama4114,2008-04-21T08:59Z,I LOVE YOU!!!!! where do you live? because i want to tank you for this torrent  by giving you a blow job

I hope that helped a little
(totaly 260 gb uploaded)"
,alc0h0lic,2008-06-12T14:49Z,"my seedbox is leeching (10% atm), when finished will seed forever with 100mbit :)"
,alc0h0lic,2008-06-14T21:53Z,"padding files are indeed a deviation from btorrent standards and therefor suck. 

btw: my 100mbit seedbox is seeding this one forever, njoy :)"
,TwilightCowboy,2008-06-30T22:31Z,Thank you! What an upload!

,supersan,2008-09-30T03:25Z,NaNo BuM you must be an awesome guy for doing this.. thanks so much again.
[M],DeeLee,2008-10-05T03:59Z,"Wow, impressive torrent.
Started to download now, ETA 45d at 16 KB/s but i guess it will go
up as I have 100/100 Mbit :) Will probably seed over 1 TB before I got
the whole torrent. Big thanks! I love documentaries.

Its safe to delete padding files and BitComet doesnt need to be used
to download this. Also, NaNo BuM, please do not use BitComet. It sucks,
as you can see. http://www.utorrent.com/ works fine if u have windows."
[M],DeeLee,2008-10-07T23:27Z,Finished in 2d 28h. 600 GB seeded. Avg 500-1000 KB/s DL speed.

,nad2006,2009-01-15T10:32Z,Hello. If anyone has BBC's screening of The Invisible Man (1984) with english subtitles please create torrent at PirateBay. Thanks in advance.
,spotty6969,2009-02-06T01:19Z,"I just registered specially to say to angel_artis... what the FUCK are you on?

Christ, if you hate the British language so much, what the fuck are you doing downloading these docs???

From your lack of knowledge of English spelling and grammar, it's clear that ""ihate it and all my family hate it that stip british stupid english!""

Have you ever thought about shutting the fuck up, to prevent yourself appearing like the cock you so clearly are?"
,wytemike,2009-02-16T18:31Z,"I completely agree spotty6969.

@angel_artis: That's an ignorant fucking comment. I'm American and probably speak like you, but what a stupid comment to say British English is annoying or WRONG in any way CONSIDERING THE LANGUAGE WE SPEAK CAME FROM ENGLAND - hence, ""English"".

Wow. I can't believe I had to say that.."
,Pagnus,2009-03-06T22:38Z,"spotty6969 Haha. Good reply. But I think some british accents sound a bit gayish. Mostly english ones. Images of british actors like Alec Guiness and David Niven pops up in my head when I hear the wort ones. Do they have live gerbils in their arsechimenys?

And a BIG thank you for the upload NaNo BuM!"
,info4free,2009-03-18T05:56Z,"thnx for uploading this great torrent! I'm a big fan of the horizon BBC shows. And here are ALOT of episodes i havent watch yet so THANK you very much!

p.s maybe you could update or make a new pack with the latetst episodes? There are alot of good quality downloads on ninjavideo.net/cat/490

DROP ACID! NOT BOMBS!"
,NaNo BuM,2009-08-12T15:06Z,"2+ Years and still going strong.
Thank you to all seeders.

Peace,

,enjoypolo,2009-09-12T13:29Z,"Thanks to everybody for sharing this, really ! I mean it's pure pleasure. Thank you. I'll do my best."
,ektakrome,2009-10-14T08:14Z,"does anyone across the pond have SKY TV and those programs on John Myatt, the art forger. I'd love to see them sometime but alas I am in America and they won't allow their programs to be bought or shared to us over here. And I'd really love to be able to see them all."
,j-d-uk,2010-07-07T12:41Z,"A great collection, may be too great!

Its size can be a problem for some, maybe you should have broken it up in to decades or years for the later ones. And the resolution, what's the lowest one and highest one or average over all, gives people an idea on quality. I appreciate the early ones will be low that's not a problem, maybe a bit of information on that would help too.

But my rant a side this is a great BBC up load, Horizon is a excellent documentary series and for people with the disk space a great all in one torrent, thank you very much!"
,dielaughing,2010-11-20T05:22Z,very nice.. my only problem is a personal one.. gonna have to devise a way to rid myself of duplicates because i'm just about at the 1TB mark in this kind of media and i'm finding duplicates here and there and i have a feeling that i already have a chunk of the contents of this torrent.. such is the life of a pirate ;/
,BraxelitO,2011-05-26T00:41Z,"I just want to give a big thanx to everyone who has keept on seeding this amazing torrent, and off course to you NaNo BuM.  THANX!"
,dielaughing,2011-06-08T11:21Z,"I'm not sure if I began my own Horizon collection with this torrent.. I can't remember.. but anyone REALLY interested in this series should hop on over to Demonoid, as I have uploaded 9 torrents with 50 episodes in each, totaling 436 in all... and I could use some help seeding them once they've gone out."
,jakart,2012-02-20T19:37Z,thanks.
