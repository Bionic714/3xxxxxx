D-A-D is a Danish rock band previously known as Disneyland After Dark, a name that had to be changed after a threatening lawsuit from The Walt Disney Company. Their style of music is often categorized as melodic heavy rock, but their earliest works is more like some kind of cross between country, rock and punk (Cowpunk). They have also used the names D.A.D., D?A?D and D:A:D, each name represents a period in the band's history.
