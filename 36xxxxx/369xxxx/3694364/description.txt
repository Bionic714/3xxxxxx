I converted a great cam to DVD. Picture and sound are great, much better than the bootleg than mysteriously fell in to my lap recently(smile).I prefer to watch my movies on the Big screen with surround sound, but hate annoying people who talk, giggle and scream through a movie.
 
You can download and Burn to a blank dvd. I use convertxtodvd or dvdcopypro or magicdvdcopeir to burn it. Whatever one you use should be fine. Or you can use Divx to watch on pc, but its a big file so I wouldn?t recommend downloading to just to watch on your pc.



This torrent is listed as DVDR because it is a DVDR file format. (There was a great panty-bunching about the description of this torrent).
