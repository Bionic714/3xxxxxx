,atlantisisdead,2008-07-18T03:27Z,"Gonna try it. I need Outlook. Why? Because I am an old person who was out of school before computers were in the home. Before computer lessons were given at school. And nowhere on the internet can I find a lesson which teaches me everything I need to know about using Outlook within the parameters of an office network, managing the fucking calendar for myself, the entire freaking HUGE group and the big boss man himself.. wtf? Never looked at one before ant these are so crowded with meetings it took 4 minutes for them to all open. Furthermore, when I tried to cancel one of his meetings for him, when it asked if I wanted to send notice to all the attendees, I wasn't sure yet if it was being cancelled or postponed and how that should be handled, so I canceled the action. Now, in any OTHER program, CANCEL means STOP DOING IT. In THIS program, it apparently means ERASE THE ENTIRE FUCKING RECORED OF THE MEETING FOREVER and DONT send notices to ANYONE. So, I am supposed to be able to learn all those little details somewhere for free (I am poor) TONIGHT on google? Make fun all you want... I need to learn. I hope it doesn't take 20 hours like another poster said..."

[V],cezen,2009-04-16T16:19Z,Could you consider adding a tag of Video Professor to your torrent so all of ours will come up together?
,plaidfish,2009-04-27T00:22Z,Thanks.
[T],neanderthal,2009-07-08T07:03Z,"So as not to dissapear like a fart in a hurricane, I will leave my comment.

The Video Professor is the WORST of the CBT creators.  You are forced to view it in a small box rather than use a player of your choice.  In addition, with some of the tutorials, you are forced to watch a VP advertisement of worthless offers each time you start the tutorial.  Not only should they be free, they should pay ME to watch it.

VP should only be used if you can't find another CBT on your subject of interest, and should NEVER be paid for."
,Charlize1,2009-07-13T06:13Z,"Thanks for the files! 
BTW I can't create the CD for certain files, using Nero Express 6, (in the Microsoft Office folder, can't make the cd for the Powerpoint and Outlook .iso files). Nero suppossedly creates the CD, (burn process completed successfully)  but it doesn't work! I get this message, when trying to run the cd: ""F:\Is not accesible. Incorrect function."" Is there a chance to upload Powerpoint and Outlook files that actually work?"
,atlantisisdead,2009-07-29T06:19Z,"I don't know what a ""CBT"" is. Sometime when I am really interested, I will google it. I just want a tutorial that won't require that I read a lot of small print for a thousand years and will force me to do hands on work with it rather than just reading about it. Maybe this does, maybe it doesn't. I will find out.

But geeze, uploader, please don't call (me) stupid

""mike18xx at 2007-12-19 07:33 CET:

I can google Excel til the cows come home, it won't teach me how to use it. And besides, the bulk of us weren't born knowing everything, so just have some kind pity on us and leave the insults at home.

Oh, btw, thanks for the upload."

A CBT stands for ""Computer Based Training"".

If you get offended easily by comments on the www, you will be in a state of constant  resentment.  I think it's an uploader's perogative is to make any comments he wants about the material he is uploading.

I wouldn't presume to speak for the uploader, but I think the point he is making is that there are much better CBTs out there for any of the subjects that the professor markets.

In any case, you posted after he made his remaks so he wasn't responding to your post personally and I didn't see him use the word stupid.  It's just a reality that most of the VP victims are going to be older folks who are novices at using PCs and navigating the internet.

You're right that googling excel won't get you very good results, but googling excel torrent or excel tutorial torrent or anything torrent will usually help you find what you are looking for.  I've found that Google will almost always give me the answers if I ask the right questions.  To paraphrase an old saying, if you give a man a CBT, he will learn for a day.  If you teach him to google, he will learn for life.

When you search TPB or other torrent sites for CBTs, look for Lynda, VTC, CBT Nuggets, Total Training, and Trainsignal to start.

For Excel, I used CBT Nuggets and Lynda CBTs and then used several ebooks that were  packaged with example files (saves alot of data entry into the worksheets).  VTC and Total Training have advanced excel CBTs if you are interested in macro automation.  Beyond that are VBA (Visual Basic Programming) for excel tutorials.  There are also a ton of ebooks geared toward just about any practical application of excel.

Whether or not one likes a VP CBT may depend on personal preference or the topic you are interested in.  I have viewed some of them in the past. before I found better ones and I can't say I didnt' learn anything or that they didn't help me.  Although some of the VP tutorials may be useful, I think there are probably better choices for most of the topics.

Personally, I haven't looked at the VP Excel CBT, but I did look at his Photoshop CBT and it was laughable.  To try to teach one how to use an application that takes up the whole screen with toolbars, menus and other task panes by zooming into a small window just seems silly.  There are much better CBT's for Photoshop.  Also, I was annoyed by the spam one has to listen to each time you start that particular tutorial.

If you find the VP CBTs useful, great.  Just ignore what others say about them.  I don't think there would be so much hostility towards him if it wasn't for his questionable marketing tactics."
