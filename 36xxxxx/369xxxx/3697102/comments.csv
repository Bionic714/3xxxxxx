,dilligafftw,2007-06-23T01:04Z,"1. Download Kubuntu Feisty: Kubuntu 7.04

2. Get the Installation CD's by using the torrent link: LinuxMCE 1.1 Beta2 (alternatively you could download these after installing Kubuntu, but CD's are so cheap that this was the method that I used)

3. Burn all three CD images to CD's

4. Insert the Kubuntu CD, Select the option to start Kubuntu from the list.

5. Once Kubuntu is up and running, click the ""Install"" icon on the desktop, follow the installation wizard until you have rebooted and are running Kubuntu from your hard drive(resist the urge to update at this time, it will cause problems with the LinuxMCE cache CD).

6. Insert the Linux MCE packages CD, when the popup window appears select the option to display the CD contents.

7. Right click on the ""mce-installer_2.0.1-1_i386.deb"" and select the option to install the package.

8. Close the window after the installation finishes and click on the new icon on your desktop that says ""Install Linux MCE"".

9. Follow the on screen prompts, insert the cache CD when requested, and finish the install. After the compute has rebooted, you may update Kubuntu using Adept. For more installation help see: The Installation Guide (step 4 and after) or ask one of the friendly people in the forum. "
,BillB0B,2007-06-25T15:27Z,If you want a nice replacement for XP try PCLinux. Easy setup and the plus is doing Video with it. Of all the Linux version I ran over the years this is a great replacement to Windows.
,todu,2007-07-08T21:32Z,"Wow, this was cool! I just watched the video about this product and if it can do half the things it says, it's still way cool. It is a Ubuntu addon to make your PC to something you can watch movies from on TV's and more. You can even use your bluetooth mobile as a remote control. Watch this video:

,marwspam,2007-07-22T04:42Z,"Maybee if you got the right hardware, and are a linux guru, you might find this easy. I've been trying the whole day to get my goddamn ati tvtuner card to work.

Might be nice, but to say its all ""plug and play"" is just nonsense."
,lsls,2007-07-22T11:42Z,will this work on ubuntu 7.04 ?
