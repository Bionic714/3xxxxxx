,Frank Forthright,2007-05-28T10:45Z,U R infected with a virus/trojan. No joke. U R FUCT. lol
,Frank Forthright,2007-05-28T10:49Z,"Scan with NOD32 or equivalent (forget that mcaffe bullshit & the like - that shit's garbage!) and clean that shit off ur computer.
Cloud9 does this shit all the time - they've been absent from the scene for about 6 months or more here, but it looks like they're back to their old trix again.
They login as diffrnt peeps & UL viruses to fuck n00b piratez.
I ain't fukkin wit u - u better clean that shit - if not, you deserve whatever bad shit happenz cuz I told u so! lol"
,jora-,2007-05-28T10:55Z,"This was taken from Cloud9 - Washington Ronald Reagan v1.01 which I got here some time ago. Might not work on new releases!
No viruses or trojans as far as I know. And I am NOT affiliated with cloud nine!

Baster23: you didn't backup first? Whoopsy!"
,Daxe24,2007-05-28T14:01Z,"For what, Simulator is this for Fs2004 or FSX"
