,01roll,2007-06-02T08:59Z,"As gTPB42 said ""Is it just me, or is it weird that everyone over 33.1% runs the same version of Azureus and has an IP of 64.125.15?.???.availible.above.net.

I have seen as many as 18 from this range of addresses. 

Why would someone go to all that trouble to have that many clients working the same files? 

I hope we get someone else at a 100% soon so this torrent can get the 300kBs all the way through.

Why would he have so many clients chewing up slots and only upload at 70Bps?"
,01roll,2007-06-02T09:33Z,"I   looked at another one of the at.worlds.end torrent and there are a bunch in the same range there too.

Could this be movie guys trying to slow down the torrent, or maybe are they trying to get good stats by downloading to their selves?"
,dinodude,2007-06-02T17:53Z,"mine is sitting at 95.9% - can view the files
but
i have the latest k-lite codec pack installed and updated but thet damn thing is still black with red and blue splashs - any ideas ?"
,01roll,2007-06-02T23:30Z,"If an admin for Piratesbay did something to ban the address in the range of 64.125.152.xxx and 64.125.154.xxx, you didn't do us any favors. His were the only seeds at 100%.

Last night there must have been close to 50 clients in those address ranges. Now there is only us 95.9%ers left. I had hoped that a few of us would get 100% then I would have done a ""kick and ban"" on his addresses. Now if he doesn't come back or someone with a 100% starts to seed we are all dead in the water. The NTI pirates didn't have any 100% this morning either, but I just looked and there were 2 at 100%, but not for this one.

Two scenarios I can think of that one would do this for, so many clients in the same holdings of addresses with such low upload speeds, would be if a film's owners wanted to sabotage the torrent, or if someone wanted to repackage the torrent then repost it in their own account while killing the original torrent.
