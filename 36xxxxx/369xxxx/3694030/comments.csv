[T],Jesper.sv,2007-05-22T12:16Z,"millennium5; haha, cool .. I dont upload much cause of only 1Mbit upload but when i do its NOT fake ;)


A question to anyone, when a torrent is uploaded whats the point that another member can upload exactly the same torrent, speed would be better if everybode went to download the same torrent?"

,FBT,2007-05-22T23:49Z,"for fu*k sake, this is a virus or something WHY THE FU*K ARE YOU DOING THIS TO ME I WANT TO SE THE LAST EPISODE OF 24 !!!! ashole!!!! "
,paarshaas,2007-05-22T23:52Z,"Yes, this one is absolutely fake. It's 360.83 MiB in size, which is not what the .NFO file mentions.

Always check the size of the file before you start downloading!"
,Gizmo_,2007-05-23T02:06Z,YOU FUCKING FUCK!!! I HATE YOU FOR THIS SHIT... this has nothing with 24 to do
[T],Jesper.sv,2007-05-23T04:50Z,"Hahah, are u serious .. this is no fake.. its the scene rls and i have watched it myself


paarshaas: say what?
RAR Size :  349MB: 25x15MB                                        
Byte Size :  366,403,584 "
,paarshaas,2007-05-23T09:28Z,"Oh.. those damn MiB's and MB's...

Anyway, if this really is not a fake, then something is seriously fucked up because the only video I got from downloading it contained 41.9 Kb of video (according to gspot) and the rest of it was random garbage.

All of that, just to convince people to install a shitty spyware video player that apparently would contain a trojan as well (though I cannot confirm that, I like my clean system)."
[T],Jesper.sv,2007-05-23T17:03Z,"paarshaas: Are u sure this is the torrent u downloaded, there are several uploads of 24.S06E24.HDTV.XviD-LOL and maybe some of the uploads are fake and the one u downloaded.
