Dundjinni Mapping software.


To get it work properly:

- Run Setup
- Use cd-key given in .txt
- Install all updates given
- Use Java 1.5 or 1.4.2. Bigger java versions will cause problems.

Now it should work. I also recommend to install updates and download new stuff from offical website.


Enjoy!
