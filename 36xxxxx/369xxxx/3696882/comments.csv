,TheEndSmiles,2007-05-27T20:34Z,"Thanx for the Seed!!!  I'm going to leave uTorrent running for the next few days, and try to help build up some more seeds.,  

Thanx again man., I'm an avid D&D player and DM. I've been looking for this program for a long time..."
,deep_stroker,2007-05-27T22:49Z,"Hey..

A big thank you for this..... Been waiting for it a long time too.
Stupid Sun systems are offline, and I cant get the java version I need. Any help would be greatly appreciated!"
,imelik,2007-05-31T23:06Z,If anyone has art packs please share them.
,BubsDeo,2007-07-25T04:51Z,"I clearly have 1.4.2 java, but it still says I don't have the correct java version, and it tries to install a java program that it doesn't have, and can't find it, so I can't go through with the installation. Can anyone help me with this?"
,Blade5593,2007-09-23T05:28Z,Anyone have any luck getting the install to not try to install java if you already have it?
,astanix,2007-09-27T04:37Z,"If you're having issues with installing, just use the old java it's looking for. http://java.sun.com/products/archive/j2se/1.4.2_02/index.html
Click the JRE Download link and install it."
,ALYRIC23,2007-10-12T15:03Z,please reseed!
,drakinn,2007-12-20T00:21Z,I can't get the pics to work in the program it only recognizes the ones I down loaded from the site after updating.  Help??
,nutbucket,2008-04-21T03:11Z,I have the same problem as drakin.
,nutbucket,2008-04-21T07:30Z,"Alright, here's what I did to solve my problem.

Uninstall Dundjinni
Install Dundjinni (follow instructions above)
Start Dundjinni
Close Dundjinni
Install Update 1.01
Start Dundjinni
Close Dundjinni
Install Update 1.02
Start Dundjinni
Close Dundjinni
Install Update 1.04

I don't know if all that is necessary, but it works now when it didn't before. (Before being when I just installed all the updates directly after installing the program.)"
,Toastee,2008-07-24T01:06Z,"I am getting a run error when I start the program after the initial install.

Says

""An error occured during startup.

You may have an improper installation, or invalid or missing map resources.

The program will be terminated.""

WTF? Why am I getting this?"
,Toastee,2008-07-24T01:15Z,"I figured it out guys...sorry...

For those with the same problem...

Just make sure you install all the patches with same keygen...

had I payed attention the first time I would have realized this....

You may all proceed to thrash me....I know you want to....go ahead."
