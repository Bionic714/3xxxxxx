,jizac2,2008-02-14T08:29Z,Thanks for the flac rels
,OzBrickie,2008-02-22T13:15Z,Being an EAC FLAC you would naturally expect it to be identical. Excellent

you cant really get better sound quality, other than buying it from tha stores //

You can skip the mc_majava message, thats not true.

Thanks for the release. 
To each Gem his good Flac ;)"

,SoCalism,2009-04-11T20:33Z,"FLAC means it loses 0% quality of the original CD quality (hence ""lossless""). also 0% tinny mp3 sound (for those who have good quality speakers). at >200kb/s downloading speed, this is a great release. thanks Joshatdot"
