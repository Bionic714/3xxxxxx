Password and regkey?"
,asdasd123123,2007-06-04T14:35Z,64 bit version perhaps?
,Zensch,2007-06-07T14:45Z,"Why is this release compressed twice both in zip and rar? Silly if you ask me since it hardly makes the download any smaller, if at all.

Please only include the actual exe and nfo file in upcoming released as it increases the chance of the torrent staying alive longer since people are less likely to delete the excess files and thus reducing the chance of the torrent being seeded for a longer amount of time.

Cheers!"

,ashandaraei,2007-06-24T20:00Z,"how the fuck do I unrar theese?
Both says that the other one is needed first"
,ashandaraei,2007-06-24T20:07Z,"Never mind
... figured it out but still don't get why.
Why compress this shit at all..."
,rzettervall,2007-08-26T17:47Z,lol
,umbertoos,2007-10-28T21:57Z,Tested and working. Thanks!
,GenniferFlowers,2008-01-02T05:01Z,"I Just MUST Say THANK-YOU VERY MUCH FOR THIS!  As for those who cannot figure out how to UnZip, then UnRAR... well, All I can say is that maybe this APP will last a little longer for the Rest of Us!  I will admit that it had me going for a few though!  Still, a WONDERFUL Upload, Masseur!  THANKS!"
,Carstuar,2008-04-08T03:53Z,"No trouble. Just read the nfo, and it works."
,tgbnhy6,2008-04-21T09:53Z,"I downloaded and installed this on 2008-03-22 and after 30 days of using ITS NOT WORKING. Only confusing msg ""tiral expired"". I am going to download some old release because this is broken."
,riffyriffyriffyriffy,2008-07-24T02:23Z,"wow... I got this program because whenever I was downloading a torrent with utorrent, it seemed to be hogging all the bandwidth and firefox could never load anything, well it could but it took years, and using netlimiter it has not only solved the problem, but the internet connection itself seems much faster, even when utorrent isn't running! amazing program. A bit sloppily archived, but well worth battling with it!"
,btisinfestedwithnoobs,2009-01-11T14:12Z,fronten: you are wrong. goodbye.
,PowerZer0,2009-11-30T01:19Z,"Great upload, but I run 64bit windows, so this doesn't work. 

For those with 32-bit just select both files, right click, then select extract here.  Then repeat for the rars. Simple. IF you got winrar installed."
,quasar_man,2010-02-28T22:46Z,"Thanks this was very easy to unzip. I just keep unzipping each file that's needed to be unzip, until everything was all unzipped. 

I do the same thing a lot in the Agent newsgroup program. It is really very easy."
,quasar_man,2010-02-28T22:49Z,I should add that I use WINWAR for all zipping and unzipping of all programs and files on my computer.

Anyone else having problems after install?"
,r0hypn0l,2010-04-24T15:15Z,"@turbocomppro Relax, it's probably a false positive. Ive had tons of false positives on applications I wrote myself!
NetLimiter is a very ""strange"" application, messing with very low-level Windows API, so it may be considered dangerous by some AV. Seeing as only one obscure product identified this torrent as ""K.gen"" is clearly showing that it may contain a KeyGen and nothing more. No reason to be alarmed :)"
,Trancemasters,2010-05-14T12:39Z,does Not work - The way u have packaged it is absolutely stupid
,dcsnowboarder41,2010-09-23T05:03Z,"why the fuck would you package it like that? also, does NOT work for me on win7"
