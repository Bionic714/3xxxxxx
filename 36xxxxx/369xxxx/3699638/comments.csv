Wellcome back with something similar - if you can find it."
,DTSES,2007-05-29T00:03Z,I'm glad for your kind words! Always posetive when someone put a word or 2 that they liked this releases and appriciate the quality that was my number 1 interest. 
,Femke22,2007-05-29T06:29Z,"To be honest, since quality is my main goal I normaly only dl respected group releases these days.

Since I allready 'own' the SE boxset I thought I give this UE boxset a shot.
Quality is top-notch, I was pleasantly suprised!

I'll be on the lookout for future releases from you for sure.

THANKS!"
