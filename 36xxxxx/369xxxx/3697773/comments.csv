,mikesmith,2007-05-26T21:49Z,i am seeding guys
[T],wacko506,2007-05-26T22:10Z,its small because the files that are useless like games and etc where removed with a programme called vlite so the smallness is good its faster so enjoy
,QuicSilver,2007-05-26T22:47Z,"Well shows only one seeder. I'm uploading to the new leechers almost 100k/bs up, if only the one seeder would seed long enough for one person to download the full copy."
[T],wacko506,2007-05-27T02:41Z,the one seed is me
,Ghost_664,2007-05-27T11:08Z,"Seed please!!!I`m stuck 21,7%....It is stable???Please answer!!Thanks."

,sasazile,2007-05-27T14:46Z,You should be online for a week... But thanks anyway! Have anyone tried this before guys? Is it functional?
,sasazile,2007-05-27T14:51Z,"Can you limit your seeding to just one person, so you can give all of the pieces to someone with a better connection?"
,QuicSilver,2007-05-28T02:03Z,Only 6 more weeks to go!
,irontowngeek,2007-05-28T02:15Z,"If I can get this downloaded,I'll seed it.

But right now,with 235 nodes and a 33% 
availability,I can't wait.
Damn leechers.
Why don't they just join up.

For StonieTonie;

Your torrent reference is even worse.
It's at 22%.

Regards."
[T],wacko506,2007-05-28T02:23Z,guys im so sorry my computer crashed i have a backup dont worry ill be online for a long time tomorrow again im soo sorry =-(
[T],wacko506,2007-05-28T17:28Z,whats a torrent reference and hi everyone we are back up and runniong ill seed for another week or so ok bye everone
[T],wacko506,2007-05-28T17:29Z,hey iron town geek i see you onmy  peer lise 33.7% cooli tyhanks again for helping me il help you when you upload ok mate thanks
[T],wacko506,2007-05-28T18:35Z,mate thers lots of people and i have more than one upload im not even donwloading coz im trying to help you
[T],wacko506,2007-05-28T21:17Z,oh and nice spelling mate ahhaah 
,irontowngeek,2007-05-29T00:41Z,"Like I said,if I can get all of it I'll seed.
I do have,I think,the same iso from a
download a while back,but it's on another drive.
As I see by the leecher count,they must want it
bad.
I will try to find the torrent reference file and
will post it,even though it belongs to someone
else.
I have not ""busted"" this iso or have run any
kind of tools on it,so it will be at YOUR RISK.
If we had seeders compared to leechers,nobody
should have any complaints about downloads.
I know you are trying and that is all that matters.

Sometime in the near future,send me an e-mail
giving details of what kind of speed you signed
up for from your ISP (DON'T POST) and I have
a traffic shaper program that will throttle the
egress of your Internet (outgoing)
Don't rely on the client software to throttle.

** A ""torrent reference"" is just that.
You are giving out a link to the same type of
posting somewhere else. **

The one StonieTonie gave out only had a .33%
share ratio.
I don't know what client you use,I use 
uTorrent.
I have used Azureus though."
[T],wacko506,2007-05-29T01:53Z,ok ishould email a wha isp whats that and i also use utorrent and thanks agin umm i will seed 24/7 for tonight so some might get it full if you could get the throttle owuld be great and thanks for replys
,irontowngeek,2007-05-29T02:35Z,"Sorry;

ISP - your Internet provider

ingress -the bandwith of your downspeed minus a few techical details I don't want to cover.

egress -the bandwith you send up to your Internet provider -minus tech details,etc.

I have now a Windows 2003 Server that will
when I'm done testing,will be a ""seed server"",
nothing else.
I'm working right now,on fine tuning the bandwith or ""speed"" I want to allow for uploads.

I want to try to have a fast upload,but an
""efficient"" one.
But,I have to be careful how fast,because most
ISP's frown on file-sharing with a residential
account.
I'm also converting to IPv6 and still use IPv4,
so I may be able to ""slipstream"" some.
I have 512/4M speed and FTP is killer,but
bit-torrents are slow.
I nite I was uploading at 186k and downloading
at around 800k,which is real good,but now
lucky to get 45k at best with same setup.
So,I may try to proxy to see if it helps.

Any ideas,I would appreciate.
I know networking,but not to keen on getting the
most out of file-sharing.

Oh,Wacko,
sorry if I sound to ""techie"" I forget who I'm
talking to.

Regards,"
[T],wacko506,2007-05-29T04:36Z,well actuall lars i quite enjoy talkting to you most grownups don't even know how to send an email so i cant talk to mum and dad and my sister is so dooly when it comes to computers so i enjoy been talked to techie i just wish i knew what the heck you were talking aboiut half the time aand im sorry if i waste your time you having to explain everything now this server this means torrents will be passed through it when uploading like having two ethernet cables one for upload and download except the down load sorry if im talking a load of rubbish anway were do you live?? if you don't mind me asking im from the U.K
[T],wacko506,2007-05-29T04:41Z,and hey lars im gona evaluate you server hope it works basically boots upload speed??
[T],wacko506,2007-05-29T04:43Z,ok i i said yes to install and then done nothing huh??
,irontowngeek,2007-05-29T06:08Z,"Don't take anything I say personally,its just
habit.
It's my tech speak of sorts and I forget to
speak in layman's terms.

In a nutshell,it's all about upload. You want to
have the up speed towards the downloader.
BUT,you DO NOT want them to ""leech""  off you.
If you want to find out what you can realistically
upload,download a file around 40 meg in size,
NOT a torrent file,something you can FTP.
I use Firefox,and it will tell me roughly what my
download speed is.
Divide the speed by 8 ( 8 bits=1byte)
I average 500k FTP on any given hour of the
day. I use cable modem.
Divide that by 8 and you get around 64k.
I use that number for my upload.
Even though I may be able to upload faster...
I can sustain the 64k upload without any
load on PC resources. (no crashes.)
It's better to sustain the upload than have it
""wobble"".
If your torrent client is set to use all available
bandwith,you are going to be in a peck of a
shape.
Right now,73 leechers and you the man.

It may take ""them"" some time to get all of it,
but you can spread the wealth a little better.
Until you get some seeders,plan on having
your computer on for awhile.

On my server,I'm having some problems
getting the port maps from the server in sync
with the firewall.
The server port is forwarding ok,but I'm not
getting any download,even when the port rules
allow any and all traffic.
It's around midnight EST in the USA and I'm
a little frustrated. Tomorrow is another day.

Regards'"
[T],wacko506,2007-05-29T16:48Z,wow wtf! 25 seeds when that happen don't worry il keep seeding too though for a wee while thanks for response lars
,Whreet,2007-05-29T20:51Z,"Do u have to write a page each time ur gonna say something iron?

I have donwloaded the file and im uploading...But why dosnt the activator work?"
[T],wacko506,2007-05-29T21:51Z,what do you mean th activator doesnt work when you in Windows Vista you just double click the ativator and it will activate it
[T],wacko506,2007-05-31T00:33Z,sorry i dont no which are and arent you might have problems with sound thats about it though
,ericcarr,2007-06-01T09:53Z,"After I installed this, just before I the Desktop would load. I would see a flash of a Blue Screen, and the computer would reboot itself. 

Any suggestions?"
[T],wacko506,2007-06-02T02:25Z,umm im not sure sorry everything worked perfect for me mybe just vista wont work on computer hard thing to hear i no but thats life sorry mate
,DonaldDuck1990,2007-06-02T03:19Z,I cant' install because it's some file missing. Any suggestions?
,Sup3rkirby,2007-06-02T06:49Z,"Just wondering about the quality of the download and about a key and activation.

How good is this version of Vista? I would like to know if there is decent driver support and how much is left of it.  Since it is so small, a good bit had to be removed from the original install.

Also, is there a key required for the install, and is there a 100% working crack for the activation? I would like someone other than wacko506 to reply because he uploaded this and so he got to use this before everyone else.  It is possible that it could work for him and not for later users such as myself."
,DonaldDuck1990,2007-06-02T15:29Z,It don't work for me. I can't install because it's some file missing.
,tolstoy_,2007-06-13T20:33Z,this needs 512mb to go not 256mb 
[T],wacko506,2007-06-14T17:22Z,No you need 512 mb to install but it will run good enough on 256mb get ma drift?
,CAXTILTECA,2007-06-24T04:28Z,"HOW DO I INSTALL THE PROGRAM? IN THE START I CAN'T USE MY PRODUCT KEY. SO I PRESS CONTINUE AND THEN IT SAY THAT THE ""SOURCES.INSTALL.WIN."" OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT FILE IS MISSING. CAN YOU HELP ME TO INSTALL THIS PROGRAM? PLEASE!"
[T],wacko506,2007-06-24T11:09Z,"Hi CAXTILTECA, so there is a file missing i'm not sure maybe a file could have got corupt during the download, try starting installation when your computer is already booted up, if you have already done that then try boot straight from the CD, if that doesn't work try downloading it again, sorry for your results, hope you all the best good luck."
[T],wacko506,2007-06-29T14:54Z,if anyone has any requests or need help just email me at wackdoc@hotmail.co.uk.

,WoNHommer,2007-07-06T01:45Z,"Ok, Downloading it right now, will seed for about a week ;)

Does this version support upgrade from XP? (I'm using Win XP MCE)

But i'm dling it slowly... 45kB/s..
Thats Ok, I can wait 4 hours, no problem...

Hope that works, because I downloaded many full vista versions, and none seems to work..."
[T],wacko506,2007-07-06T22:48Z,"about your question, i think you can upgrade if you  do install during windows booted up =, im not sure, but this definetely works i gave used it many times, and its faster than the full version so, this one gets my thumbs up not just saying that"
,WoNHommer,2007-07-06T23:57Z,"It installed OK (I did a clean install), but when it starts, all I get is a fast BSOD (blue screen) and then the PC restarts...

Btw, that was the only version that even installed...

I reinstalled it like 3 or 4 times, and still getting the BSOD...

I had to format, so I can't seed it as I lost the downloaded files... All my important info. was on my second HD, so no problem ;)

I'll try to use vLite myself and make a Brazilian Lite Version, then I'll try to install *again*... I bought a pirated DVD with full vista ultimate (BR version), and it didn't install either. I installed it once, but I had to format, and now I can't install anymore...

I'm hoping that vLite will make me an usable version, or else I'll have to stick with WinXP -.-

Thank you for this torrent though, hopefully it will help many people..."
,WoNHommer,2007-07-06T23:58Z,"Tell me if you can't understand something, because my English is not perfect, I'm brazilian ;)"
[T],wacko506,2007-07-07T23:30Z,"ok do you have a 64 bit processor if you do then thats whats wrong, and im 99% sureyou have so check it. this is 32 bit edition so thats why you crash."
,WoNHommer,2007-07-11T17:32Z,"It's not x64...

I just installed the x86 PT-BR version, and it worked..."
[T],wacko506,2007-07-12T04:32Z,ok sorry mine didnt work for you.
