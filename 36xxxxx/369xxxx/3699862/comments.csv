,T-rad,2007-09-29T17:18Z,"file to patch:

,babykittents,2007-11-27T04:58Z,"T, Can you make a Patch for the 2.1.0.23. it auto updated.. "
,Sikkwolf,2007-12-20T05:57Z,"This is a trash torrent, the ceedo installer connects to the net and downloads the most recent ceedo V (now 2.2.1.23). So the fact that the patch is valid does you no good because it won't work on anything past 2.1.0.22."
,ratsiva,2007-12-24T13:38Z,"Very good stuff T-rad ;) New patch works for 2.2.1.23

Now what we need is a off line-install for this version (2.2.1.23).. any idea where to get it ?

Better yet, are there any alternatives to Ceedo, besides U3.. (Ceedo dosn't run on my home PC with WIN64XP)"
