,David89an,2008-08-24T18:17Z,"Works in ""Media Player Classic"" for me, else you can try out ""Real Alternative"" or ""RealPlayer"". This file is a rmvb file, which stands for ""RealMedia Variable Bitrate"". Its a new way to compromise files with a relative good qualety."

,KEEVVY,2011-01-23T18:02Z,"Man Rmvb it's an old format, it will work very well with real player, for bs.player or other programs you will need a little codec, I don't remember the name but I remember was the only way to wach a rmvb movie in bsplayer."
