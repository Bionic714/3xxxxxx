Seventribe hails from Västerås (100 km west of Stockholm) and is an army of eight metal heads. Since the start way back in 1999 they have contributed to form the genre aggro-metal. Having more than 100 gigs behind them they have created a reputation of being a live act supreme. Even before signing to Alabama Records they performed at renowned festivals as Arvikafestivalen, Rookie-Festival (Hultsfred), Metal Meet, Arosfestivalen and MoshFest (NO) to mention but a few.

The bands prior promo-CDs have been spread all over the world in thousands of copies. Fans in far away nations have put up their own ?Riot-Tribes? to salute the Swedes. The demand is particularly great in Scandinavia, Germany, USA and South America.

Says Andreas Nyström of Alabama Records ?Seventribe has got their audience in a stranglehold when performing live on stage. If you?ve ever had the chance to see their show you?ll know exactly what I am referring to. Seventribe is something out of the ordinary and we are extremely proud to release the debut album of this highly acclaimed metal act.?
