Here are the problems:
1) Track 9 is cut off; it's length of 1:32 should be over double that (around 3:22).
2) Track 13 has the wrong track number but right title; it is actually track 16 (Pretender Got My Heart), in full. Its ID3 tag is wrong. The album's real track 13 (Stop, Look, Listen To Your Hear) is entirely _missing_ from this archive.
3) Track 15 is cut off by several seconds, at least. Annoying.
4) Track 16 is cut off. It's only the first minute of the song. However this song, in its entirety, is in the file  (see problem 2 above).
5) Track 17 is cut off by a few seconds. Again, annoying.
6) Track 19 is full of incongruous jumps. Impossible to enjoy.

Apart from this, the sound quality is good: some mp3s are encoded at 128 kbps, some at 192, some at 320.

Btw, this is the special edition soundtrack album with 4 bonus tracks for a total of 19, not the original with only 15."
