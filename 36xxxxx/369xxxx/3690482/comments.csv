,lamer_gamer,2011-10-15T11:13Z,"I totally thought this was going to be just like a guide book. Like The Zombie Survival Guide. Open it up, pick and choose what you really are interested in, and go from there. This was actually an interesting story, though. It imparts some knowledge, techniques and strategies to picking up women, but that stuff seems kind of incidental by the end of the book. It's a pretty good read, honestly."
,madeoffur,2011-10-15T21:37Z,"I actually came back to this book, because I just love the voice of the reader, and also ""the game"" has a warm place in my heart because that's where it all began, you know :) good quality book, surprisingly good story, and of course, interesting theme."
