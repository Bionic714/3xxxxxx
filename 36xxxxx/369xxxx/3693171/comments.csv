,MajestikMilitant,2007-07-04T12:14Z,"HEY Wraith what did you use to compress these Simpson's files this is the best compression i have ever seen. when i went to download these files i started a 4.5gb 18th season as well thinking this one would be shit quality but there shit hot and a hole 3GB SMALLER WOW. I have A LOT of TV episodes from Simpson's and war at home to UK classics. They are mainly 174mb but i am low on hard drives and have to many discs all over the place so if you could teach me how this is done i would be much grateful and would be able to share a Whole load of files for D/L to get much quicker. my email address is majestikmilitantz@hotmail.co.uk

,elyk1212,2007-09-09T23:05Z,"""Linux sucks almost no games work on it.""

This is the fault of the developers (or more directly, the fault of the masses, who are holding on to windows instead of moving on to a superior system).  They don't always develop a Linux build due to the time to port and having a smaller market.  

**It has nothing to do with how Linux is as a product or reliability factors, but only with demand for marketing a game for Linux.

If folks used OpenGl instead of DirectX (or other MS proprietary non portable) codebase, it would be fairly trivial to write portable code that would work on both systems.  It will slowly start to happen, I think.  

On a higher layer, there are so many great 3d engines with flexible licenses, so many cool projects similar ""Cube 2"" or using Ogre, etc, will start pooping out for linux.

Fun stuff. "
,s0der999,2007-09-12T15:28Z,what is this for crap it dosent work in vlc ffs!
