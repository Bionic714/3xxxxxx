,grammarye,2007-08-14T16:26Z,"Worked for me! Yesssss!!  

The detailed instructions are good, but  remember that a870.sentinel, etc are found within the LEGEND folder within the ISO directory (in my case burnt to a CD).  Also, I found that I couldn't run the LicGen.exe until I copied the LEGEND folder onto a writeable disk (ie my hard disk)

You might have to get the Microsoft .NET framework from the net, just google and download it. I downloaded version 2.

Also, when running wechoid.exe, I thought it best to uncheck IP address as one of the ""Lock"" system attributes which presumably Accumark checks at runtime against the licence to ensure it matches. That's because my IP address is dynamically allocated.

As warned, I got the first error message after running LicGen.exe, but as the instructions pointed out, it doesn't affect anything and my LaunchPad turned brown indicating the licence was accepted! Now I just have to LEARN how to use the damn thing to make digital, gradeable patterns!  Yep, sure, once I make some money I'll buy the program, but I'd NEVER be able to afford it before then."
,Faaya,2007-09-01T03:48Z,I get an error everytime I type in the licgen xx ????? working.lic part (with the respective required info filled in).  I am not able to get a working code.  Does anyone know how to fix this?  It's beyond my level of expertise.

DETAILED INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS

=========================================================================
A.      INSTALLING THE PROGRAM
=========================================================================
        [Note - E: signifies the drive letter of your CD-ROM drive.]

1.      Burn the .ISO file to a CD-rom or mount using Ultra ISO.

2.      Start the Setup.exe from the root directory and your web browser    
        opens.
        This gives you some information about the programs

3.      Test for minimum requirements.

        a)      You must have Microsoft 1.1 and 2.0 .NET framework installed.
                Yes, both installed - Go figure!
                Probably in order...

                        1.1 .NET framework
                        1.1 .NET framework Service Pack 1
                        2.0 .NET framework

                Trying to find some ""how to"" information on .Net Framework is    
                like trying to find Brittany at a custody hearing.

        b)      Now test to see if you meet the minimum requirements using
                E:\SysReq\setup.exe
                Doing this will prove valuable to avoid problems later.

                It checks to see what you have and don't have.
                        - The appropriate Operating System
                        - The minimum service packs to your OS
                        - The minimum RAM
                        - The minimum processor
                        - The minimum free disk space
                        - Adobe Acrobat Reader : Even if you have a more recent    
                          version of Adobe Acrobat Reader you will still get a    
                          ""NOT FOUND"" message
                          when you run E:\SysReq\setup.exe.
                          Just ignore it and move on.
                        - Internet Explorer 6.x
                        - Microsoft Management Console (MMC)
                        - .NET Framework

                You can find out more about these requirements at
                E:\Docs\AccuMark\Requirements.htm

4.      Start installation of ""AccuMark TM"".

        a)      Although the .htm setup file gives you the options for    
                installing the programs install each program individually:

        b)      Install Adobe Acrobat Reader only if you need it.
                It reads the .pdf files included on the disc.

                        E:\Acrobat Reader V5.1 English with Search
                        \AcroReader51_ENU_full.exe

                If you have a more recent version of Adobe Acrobat Reader you    
                will still get a ""NOT FOUND"" message when you run
                E:\SysReq\setup.exe.

                Just ignore it and move on to the next step.

        c)      Install AccuMark(tm) Professional Edition Software using
                E:\AccuMark\install.exe

        d)      If you want any other programs included on the disk then you
                will need to read the respective .pdf's

        e)      Documentation includes the following...

                (i)     Release Notes - E:\AccuMark\Program Files\
                Gerber Technology\AccuMark V8\AccuMark\relnot_pe.pdf
                (ii)    What's New -
                        E:\AccuMark\Program Files\Gerber Technology\
                AccuMark V8\AccuMark\whatsnew_pe.pdf
                (iii)   Configuration Notes - E:\AccuMark\Program Files\
                        Gerber Technology\AccuMark V8\AccuMark\confignotes.pdf
                (iv)    Training Materials - e:\training docs

        f)      Read the AccuMark(tm) Professional Edition release notes for    
                other important information.

,Peachie,2008-06-29T06:52Z,"The part I don't get is after you go to run and type in ""cmd.exe"" and press enter. Then you open the folder where LicGen is, where do you type in the code and selector. Am I making a folder that is called LICGEN XX ????? WORKING.LIC or do I type LICGEN XX ????? WORKING.LIC in the cmd.exe dialog box? And if so, I don't know how to. 

Also, I thought maybe I open the LICGEN (under LENGEND) and type in LICGEN XX ????? WORKING.LIC. if this is true my Licgen dialog box won't stay open. It appears and then disappears.

Here are the version numbers for v8.3:

The AccuMark? Family CD-ROM contains the following Gerber Technology Products:
*	AccuMark? Version 8.3.1.446
*	GERBERplanner	Version 8.3.1
*	Made to Measure System Version 8.3.1

Third party packages included on the CD-ROM
*	Adobe Acrobat Reader Version 8.0
*	MMC (Microsoft Management Console)	Version 1.2
*	Rainbow Security
*	Sentinel System Driver Version 7.4.0

This version is supposed to work with Vista.  If anyone has the crack for v8.3, let me know and I can try it out.  If it works, I'll try to find some way to get it on here with both CDs and the crack."

error...

problem whilst creating the license file I have a solution that worked for me.

First of all either copy and run the legend folder and and licgen to your HDD or make sure the syntax for the licgen includes a local folder for the working.lic file ie change in the syntax to c:/working.lic

The main cause for the error error error was that the emulator was not running. Insure that when this is installed the the compatibility settings are on windows xp service pack 3 and run as admin. In fact do this for all apps that you need to run if using vista or win 7. When the emulation installs although nothing visual happens you should be able to see an hour glass and hear your comp installing it for a split second.
