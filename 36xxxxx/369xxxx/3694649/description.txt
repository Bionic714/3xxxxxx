Yo: Danny Fenton, he was just fourteen
When his parents built a very strange machine
Designed to view a world unseen...

When it didn't quite work, his folks they just quit
But then Danny took a look inside of it
There was a great big flash; everything just changed
His molecules got all rearranged!

When he first woke up he realized
He had snow white hair and glowing green eyes
He could walk through walls, disappear, and fly!
He was much more unique than the other guy!

It was then that he knew what he had to do
He had to stop all the ghosts that were coming through
He's here to fight for me and you!

Teenager Daniel Fenton has a secret entrusted only to his friends Tucker and Sam(antha): He can turn into a ghost!

-- While rather modestly drawn, "Danny Phantom" is elevated into greatness by excellent voice-casting and acting, wide-ranging scripts, witty (without becoming tiresome) dialogue, a remarkably low ratio of "filler episodes", and the best title cards and theme music since "Batman: The Animated Series".

"Danny Phantom" rates a "9" on the Cartoon Rating Guide for Smart Adults.

I have to admit it. I'm a Danny Phantom addict. i'm a 33 yr old father of three and my two sons (3yr and 2 yrs) and i watch this show every time it is on. The artwork of the show is superb when compared to many of todays, or the last decades, cartoons. The plot and storyline are excellent for the average teen or even young teen, and the lines are better than many of the adult intended lines from bugs bunny. Heavy with sarcasm, dry humor and a bumbling fathers exploits, this show rocks. There's enough reality based topics in the plot for any teen to relate to, and many adults will take great humor in the dialogue. I personally believe the show caters to a sense of family and friends, either group can benefit from this. Whether you choose to watch this with your family or sit back with your family, you'll certainly enjoy this cartoon. I'm proud to say i watch this.
