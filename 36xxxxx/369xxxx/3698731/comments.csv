,paintspot,2007-05-28T17:36Z,"the torrent is sticking at 75-80%, please seed :("
,roborabbit,2007-05-29T19:40Z,"seed please, i'm stuck at 93,7%"
,ultrapope,2007-05-29T21:50Z,"Honestly, would you expect someone to magically appear and start seeding because you wrote it here? IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE! IT COUNTS AS SPAM!


Ahem. Apart from that, my router is acting funny. Has been for a few weeks now. I'll try to keep an eye on it (restarting it helps), but I'm very nearly never physically near it. Gotta get me a damned seedbox."
,Snoop_mann,2007-06-02T17:05Z,"And you, of course, believe that if you tell the world that your router's acting funny, the little magical router fairy will come to your home at night and fix your little router problem, dontya? Seriously, who gives a f**k? And don't tell others not to do things that you do yourself, man!"
,ultrapope,2007-06-04T00:21Z,"Snoop_mann:
Why don't you go suck a fuck. The torrent was stuck because I was the original seeder and I was explaining to those interested why it had been stuck. Maybe by replying to you, the magical STFU-fairy will come and stick a star-tipped magic wand up your ass. "
,richey90,2007-06-05T22:55Z,"haha, ultra, dont worry..
well, maybe people should learn to thank before starting to bitch,
anywho.. thx for the upload ;)"
,Sanstrian,2007-06-27T07:09Z,nothing wrong with asking people to seed imo as long as those who ask seed in return
,lessah,2007-07-04T13:46Z,"sanstrian you stupid fuck, you are soo smart, go fuck yourself.. bitch"
,Sanstrian,2007-07-06T09:39Z,i'm sure you're the type of idiot who doesn't seed gfg
