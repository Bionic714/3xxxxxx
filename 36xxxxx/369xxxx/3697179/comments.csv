These songs are great. Good fret work also, especially on the candlebox song. Please give us more. Would like to request metallica,ac-dc, and more van halen."
,FlyingAnvil,2008-01-15T04:42Z,"Thanks for the kind words.

Alas, career and family have sapped all of my time lately.  I'm really anal about the fret-timing so it tends to be a pretty lengthy process for me.  However, perhaps the generous praise will encourage me to do more.

Thanks a lot!"
