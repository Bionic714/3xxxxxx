,Topedge,2007-07-22T12:34Z,Could someone please seed this torrent!
,Topedge,2007-07-31T23:04Z,Would someone please seed this!
,faako,2007-08-16T09:52Z,"WTF?? Realy could use a SEED!! Good material IF this were a real torrent. Been stuck at 15.5% for a week, this is BULL!"
,brustrev,2007-09-23T19:24Z,15% and no seeds ... damn.
,Masked Muchacho,2007-09-26T10:35Z,"This is good stuff, please seed..."
,freesoft,2007-09-28T12:26Z,Seed :-)
,jaybee276,2007-09-28T17:03Z,"We are all sitting here like Lemons at 15.5%. I think that people who upload should somehow be obliged to stay seeding for one complete month. If something like that happened we would not have so many dead torrents.

It looks like this one is truly dead. --- Shame!!!"
,jaybee276,2007-09-30T18:08Z,You would think the guy who uploaded this would check back to see how his torrent was doing. It  seems that he has not been heard of regarding any torrent since May 2007. Maybe he died - just like his torrent?
,jaybee276,2007-11-24T19:47Z,Two months later and we are at 35.9% Is this to be a new Guinness Book Record or what?
,buffalorider,2008-02-11T17:39Z,"Would someone please seed this!!
I will have retired before I could make use of this material. "
,Stormhold,2008-03-11T03:07Z,pls seed little more plssssss
,jaybee276,2008-03-24T14:33Z,"This torrent has never been fully seeded. SSSoldier whoever he is must be a complete PRATT He has never been connected long enough for a complete seed to be accomplished by anyone. Nearly a year now and we are STILL trying. Must be an all time record!!!

I usually give up after a month but this could take a lifetime or more!!! (someone like me to mention it in my will?)"
,jaybee276,2008-04-21T13:22Z,We are now at 94% - it has taken almost one year to reach this point. C'mon SSSoldier just another 6% and we are there. Note for SSSoldier you need to leave your computer on long enough to achieve the first seed. If you dont then it can take up to one year - just like this torrent!
,jaybee276,2008-04-29T21:02Z,@ mifarelight so are you saying that we will not be able to go past 96.3%? are you also saying that it was you who got us up to 96.3%? if so - thanks very much for your valiant effort!
,tj8,2008-05-01T21:47Z,"With all respect to everyone,
While reading the comments, there were 1 or 2
complained about the downloads, then a few abt
for seeding. Then one gentleman saying, ""Maybe he died - just like his torrent?"" !!!

If anyone has got the complete data, pls 
create a new torrent. Let the community move on ...

And pls. remember to leave an pointer to the
new torrent here, tha the rest of us would know
what torrent to download."

,firewolfinwa,2008-06-28T22:32Z,"C'mon guys..... doesn't ANYONE have the last 3.2% that the rest of the planet needs to help seed this to others? 

Let's go here people!"
,jaybee276,2008-07-12T12:52Z,Jeeezzz::: There is still hope. we are now up to 97% - maybe in a few years we will get the other 3%
,sriramank,2008-07-31T03:02Z,ya. . . still 97%... some books are really good. .
,sriramank,2008-07-31T03:15Z,i can find a seeder.. may be if we update the tracker list we can score a 100%. i tried my best but wouldn't succeed...
,wesley1987,2008-09-01T18:15Z,"got lack at 97.0%....

,dubakur,2008-09-14T14:45Z,pls somebody seed stuck at 97%
,akumarc,2008-09-21T09:52Z,"Does that mean sssoldier loaded this torrent and people could only download only max. 75% when he got away with contents of torrents. Is there a way we can send message to sssoldier.

Guys please seed"
,akumarc,2008-09-21T09:53Z,Sorry 97% and not 75%. I am stuck at 97%
[T],Arrrrrrrrrr,2008-09-27T21:30Z,"The ""stuck at 97%"" is still going on several months later. Chance of ever getting 100% is becoming rather small. However due to the large (1MB) chunk size, 25 of the 63 books are incomplete/useless, rather than all of them, which may explain why this offering remains on the Top 100."
,nthetri,2009-01-21T05:52Z,good
,bi0monkey,2009-03-20T09:41Z,hey ssfuckhead seed this shit or get the fuck off tpb

,telx09,2009-06-29T01:07Z,"I failed my test because of that lying cheating sssoldier, and shall now dedicate the rest of my life towards retrieving these  final 3%!!!!"
,johnzanor,2009-07-05T15:49Z,I was planing to download this torrent and escape to a small beach town in brazil with my computers - Stay there fore 5 years while bath with all these books -wtf...
,johnzanor,2009-07-05T15:50Z,97.3 %...thats all I get :(
,Quiet_German,2009-07-14T04:48Z,"I was looking at the ""available"" file size and there is only .973 of it available.  That is why we are all stuck at the same level.

Basically, the person(s) with the entire file have turned their file sharing off and have left us sharing 97.3% of the file.  We are sharing ""leeches"" and since there are no ""seeders"" with the full file, we will be stuck at 97.3%.  Hope that made sense.  Now, will a seeder please step forward!

You can use most of the file still. Most of it works ok."
,Lalitpatanpur,2009-09-24T14:48Z,97.3% feel the BURN!
