Synopsis:   Sierra Nevada following the Mexican-American War in 1847. When a dazed survivor (Carlyle) of an unfortunate expedition shows up at the outpost, it isnt long before he reveals himself to be a murderous madman with a taste for human flesh. An offbeat, blackly comic and extremely bloody effort from English director Bird (PRIEST).
