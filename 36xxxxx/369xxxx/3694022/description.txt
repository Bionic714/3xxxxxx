Explosions in the Sky, one of the best post-rock bands in the world, have some amazing music. They did the entire sound track to Friday Night Lights, and they deserve to be discovered by you!

This is their discography up to May 22, 2007. Includes all albums; \'How Strange, Innocence\', \'Those Who Tell the Truth Shall Die, Those Who Tell the Truth Shall Live Forever\', \'The Earth Is Not a Cold Dead Place\', \'The Rescue\' aka \'Travels in Constants vol. 21\', and their latest \'All of a Sudden I Miss Everyone\'

Please download and enjoy! This is the least-offensive music ever, and I haven\'t met a single soul who hasn\'t enjoyed it.
