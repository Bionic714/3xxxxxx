,mastersem,2008-03-04T21:48Z,"you mean you downloaded the torrent here? first you need a torrent downloader (i c that utorrent is the most loved here, but i recommend u bittorrent) and then open that file you downloaded with the torrent downloader. it will download it. then when done you have to mount the iso with daemon tools. you can download that at www.daemon-tools.cc. if its a rip then you need to unpack it in a folder. thats all i have to say. btw any seeders?"

,amathaka,2010-11-08T12:38Z,"Genuine.
Works for me but involved a lot of effort.
(But then what doesn't with vista?)

For anyone having problems with it not detecting the CD, go to gamecopyworld and get the v1.7 winxp no-cd fix.

Follow the instructions precisely and it will work."
,GoblinPirate,2011-01-07T06:38Z,"Hey everyone.
I'm having some problem with this torrent and was hoping for some help.

I got it down and with Daemon Tools Pro i installed it, mounted as a IDE. I have tried installing both through the CCD and the IMG files, however both seem to yield the same result.

I start the game, either normaly or as administrator. a ""SafeDisc"" window appears for a split second, before the screen turns black a couple of seconds, then returns to my windows screen. Nothing happens after that.
Please help me out, it's abit of a problem and i'd really like to play this game.

I figured it shuldn't be a CD-crack problem since i'm not recieving any message of missing the CD, however i'm not a expert and could be wrong.
I've also experienced that sometimes when i mount the different files, the ""autorun"" feature dose not show for some reason.

I'm using Windows 7 and a widescreen incase that is important. Please help me out."
,GoblinPirate,2011-01-07T07:20Z,"Right, so after a whole bunch of follow up work i managed to solve my problem:

First of all, the SafeDisc is apperantly a anti mounting program, luckily the one on DK2 is easily removed with a simple No-CD crack found anywhere, first hit on google.

Also, i found a solution to the movies problem, the thing is that DK2 has its movies inside the CD, so all you need to do is open the files and find the ""movies"" folder inside ""DATA"" and move it to your installed folder.


However, when all was said and done i ended up with a new problem that i hope people will be able to help me solve.

I start up the game and it runs smoothly through the introduction Bullsfrog and the intro movie, however when the intro movie is completed, the game shuts down with a neat and prompt ""DK2 has stopped working due to some kind of problem, please shut down the program"".

Please help me, i have come upon yet another obstacle in my quest to conquer this game! "
,enzaisgod,2011-01-13T04:30Z,"hello, i am a complete noob to this downloading business...usually i get my cousin to help but yeah...anyway i downloaded this game, correctly..well as  i was shown...but now i cant open it...so what do i need to do? any help would be so much appreciated..."
,Chazzk,2011-01-15T17:45Z,"Here's hoping this works... For once I actually have a legit copy, but the CD got wrecked! Here's hoping I can get the blasted thing installed..."

Every time I hit the menu button or ESC a few minutes into the game it goes down, tried Comp Administrator, cracks, no cracks, even installed Win98 on a VM.

,SimianJ,2011-03-08T20:08Z,"The Torrent works HOWEVER for those on windows 7: You will need a NO CD crack, you will also need to modify the settings on the SHORTCUT: set to compatibility mode windows xp, disable visual themes and disable desktop composition. this is version 1.7 of the game. Once in the game disable hardware acceleration in the graphics properties then load a level for the graphics engine to reboot and the changes to take effect.  This also appears to be the Silver version which means it will crash somewhere around level 4 of the campagne. "
,SimianJ,2011-03-10T05:37Z,"update: the 1.8 fan created patch for windows xp, vista etc may or may not work to fix the crashing. I tried with win 7 64bit and it didnt work to fix the crashing on stage for or during pet dungeons"

,eck_tk,2011-06-25T14:52Z,"i put on crack and stuff to make it work, but every time i play the black background moves over game covering everything in black.only the mouse and some menus are still visible. can anyone help?
i put way to much effort into getting this to work already."
,CCrayon,2011-06-26T05:06Z,"Hey everyone I'm on windows 7 64 bit. Got the game to work.

1. Installed Game
2. Downloaded crack that Panchz provided a link to (thanks man)

3.Right clicked on the crack and went to properties then compatibility, and set Run as Administrator, and ran with compatibility Windows XP, service pack 2, through what Goblin Pirate suggested (thanks to you too)... Then also did as SimianJ suggested: disable visual themes and disable desktop composition.

4. then also followed his advice on going to the Data/ folder in the cd and copying the Movies folder over to my /Data folder on my C: drive.

5. After that, start the game and it should take you to the main menu, and will still have the black-screen issue. Go to game options from the main menu and then graphics and disable hardware acceleration and hit ok. It'll still be doing the black screen thing... Start / load a game (skirmish, campaign, anything), then quit as soon as it starts. You might need to restart game or reboot after this too, but hopefully not and you should see that the menu is looking all... well... non-black-pixelly. :P

Thanks heaps guys!"

 Once there you will have to type in ''regedit'' ( This will open your computers registery editor )

 Click on HKEY_CURRENT_USER

 Step 5
 Click on Software

 Step 6
 Click on Bullfrog Productions Ltd
