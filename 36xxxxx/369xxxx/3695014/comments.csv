Had the same problem as crzy at first but it was easy enough to get around, when the AR screen comes up just hit start on your controler to start the game without codes. 

Burned to sony DVD with nero 8, using a matrix infinity 1.99 modded ps2."
,thai-nisse,2008-06-03T16:58Z,Is this an american release ??
,ozcar85,2008-08-01T06:39Z,"So i dont have a hard drive on my ps2... its the smaller, newer version actually. Will this thing actually work on it? yes or no? Help anyone?"
,Vosined,2008-08-06T14:44Z,"Helpppp please!!!
As you said, I go to the expert mode, but the game won't start if I don't put any code. It says that the code is invaled. What can I do about it?"
,Vosined,2008-08-06T15:54Z,"Finally I got it! Go to the friking ""Expert Mode"" and in this menu click """"""START"""""", this information I found in the running stroke in the Expert Mode menu. It may ask you first to create a game, you can create it but do not load empty strokes with codes, just click """"""STAAAAART"""""""" in this stupid menu and the little window will appear asking to launch a game.
Good Luck!"

I'm using HDLoader 0.8c on a PS2 modded with a Messiah 2 chip, and the stupid ARMax always freezes before I can launch the game."
,traxdata1,2008-10-13T09:24Z,"this is everything else but not the game of dragon quest!!! hdd, hdloader, bla bla, there's no game inside the iso. so it's not the game - simply and clear!!!"
