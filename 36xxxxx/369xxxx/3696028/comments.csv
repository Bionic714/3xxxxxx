,PapaKim,2007-05-25T18:24Z,"nuonu...yes...someone might understand finnish also...Ei kaiken tarvii olla kenkuksi tai svenskaksi.

Joka tapauksessa, good song and it isn't singers fault if it sound boring.I believe she didn't make this song alone. I love her voice!"

,Hybrid_Pirate,2007-05-27T15:26Z,"I know what they call their new album: ""Left her by the shore""

Anyone know the real name of the album?"
,rohan2kool,2007-05-27T17:05Z,anette olzon is too-damn-hot [hotter than tarja].. yet to see how she sings though :D
,MaiaMadness,2007-06-14T01:03Z,"I used to really love Tarja; she even got me interessted in singing classical, which I'm now getting quite good at, but at some point her voice started to bother me. She was excellent on Oceanborn, because there she had the purely classical, dramatic manner of singing. But then something started to happen. Wishmaster was still good, and Century Child has all my favourite songs, but her voice started to change. Once was terrible, really, and the new version of Sleeping Sun was an absolute disaster. It was almost as though she had stopped trying.

That said, I don't like this chick. She has a boring, uninspiring voice. I had really hoped for some more power in the new vocalist. I mean, for chrissakes, Nightwish has always been symphonic POWER Metal. Remember Wishmaster? Orion? End of All Hope? This is a balad, so the other songs might sound different, and knowing myself I will buy the new album, but I don't like this. I had been hoping for another classical singer, perhaps more lyrical and controlled than Tarja. At least Anette's English is better..."
,MaiaMadness,2007-06-14T01:08Z,"Oh, and the new album is called Dark Passion Play and will be released on September 26th in Finland and September 28th everywhere else."
,coldangel,2007-06-16T00:53Z,"sounds like shit... they shod never kickt out Tarja she was nightwish, now the band is a bad copy of within temptation."
,Zanx,2007-06-27T18:03Z,They kicked Tarja becouse she got to self consentrated. All she wanted was money and she performed as a diva. They thought that it wasent an ok behaviour so she got kicked
