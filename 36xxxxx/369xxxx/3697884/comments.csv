This is very hard to come by.

Sorry for the mispelled folder and torrent name, its Fantazia, with a Z not an S, but easily fixed so I wont remove it. 

On 500kbs seed mode right now, grab it while its hot."

,idiotsdayout,2007-05-27T23:19Z,i think i hav this on original fantazia tape b great 2 hav it on cd though cheers ! the old tunes r the best 
,malvin,2007-05-30T13:32Z,Please seed for a few minutes.. There's like 20 odd people stuck on 99.7%
,Paleindian,2007-06-02T09:25Z,"Look at the files, they all work.

The torrent was a dud, its full at 97% and I have verified this with my own full file.

Sorry, but the damn thing screwed the hash check or somthing, just go to the folder and play them, they are fine."
,Paleindian,2007-06-02T09:34Z,"I have tried creating new torrent, (diff hash, no good) fixing it and doing a bongo drum rain dance, to no avail. One guy downloaded almost twice the file size trying to get the last 0.3% that actually does not exist!!

I love this album BTW. It was one of my favorites through the 90's, along with a ratpack mix, which I have on MP3 somewhere too..
Sweet harmony remixes etc.

Anyhoo, I cannot seem to post links, but I have a direct dload for this Fantazia file over at rapidshare. If anyone knows how I might post it, let me know."
,malvin,2007-06-03T10:28Z,"Yeah, they work ok. I'm missing, like 2 seconds. but what the hell, Much better than a 10 year old cassette!!!"
,darkside2698,2007-09-19T00:15Z,FFS SEED  If its full at 99.7% why cant I play it? Is there a way to extract?  Ive been stuck for 2 months.
,PatMason,2008-06-10T22:12Z,please keep seedin' it stopped downloading at 98.8 !!!!!!!!!!!!!
