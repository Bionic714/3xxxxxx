,jeanniescot,2007-08-19T04:42Z,serial no longer works
,Gypsywind,2008-02-01T03:27Z,"Yes, when you try to register it tells you the serial # is pirated, and the program will not work."
,Advize,2008-02-14T21:18Z,"This does work I just tried it.

Step 1: Download and extra the install file and the serial.

Step 2: Disconnect internet.

Step 3: Run the exe and install it.

Step 4: Open DriverMagic, click on ""Help"" at the top of the window (to the right of ""Action"") select ""Register Now..."". Enter The serial and click activate or okay or whatever it says there (don't really remember).

It should thank you for registering, blah blah blah, etc.

Step 5: Close DriverMagic, reconnect internet, open DriverMagic, enjoy.
