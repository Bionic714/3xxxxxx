I'm from Brazil, and have just a 600/300 Kbps conecction... So, I'll upload up to a 20 kB/s

Third world contrys sucks!!

I wanna a 100MB like in Japan!!! LoL"
,ewsi,2007-07-26T18:01Z,"Why dont you stop winning and drag your sorry ass to Japan where u can have a 10 mbit connection to download and upload whatever you feel like?

Stop feeling sorry for youself.
We live in a ""third world country"" because of suckers like you, with no pride nor decent objective.

You'd rather go around kissing some foreigners futile access to technology then thank for what you've got.

Many people dont even have access to the internet and you're complaining about your ""slow"" connection.

If anybody out there has a complaint about your ""slow"" upload rates, they might as well go to the store and license the software.

I have a suggestion for you, put a little pride on your talk, a country is made of its people, who have the government they deserve, and its clear by your talk that you deserve a dialup connection, not broadband.

Otherwise, do us a favor and move your ass over to japan and stay there, you're not helping.

Our country doesnt suck, its a Bless. Its a shame we have narrow minded people like you in the boat.

Listen to your sorry talk ""Im from Brazil and I'm sorry I'm a sucker...""

Pride it up, buddy!"

But thanks for the file."
,generalfunny007,2007-10-14T04:33Z,i have installed it... but it asks for a license key ..where  can i get it
,tonhaosemacento,2007-10-27T23:17Z,"What we need isn't people that think ""thanks for this crap. It's all that we need"".

We need access to technology, such fast internet  connections.

In some places in Brazil there's connections of 2MB until 8MB. But in big cities only.

If you live in a city with less then 200k people, forget this.

By the way, this technology is available at least 10 years.

Why we can't have this here? Because the monopoly of the Telecoms, and bastards like you that thing in a retard way: ""If we don't have nothings better, what we have is excellent"".

For this reason that Lula is still President."
,ednum5,2008-01-19T17:04Z,"Yes, as generalfunny007 says where's the license? The file supplied is not rational_server_perm.dat as it says in the crack.txt file, it is rational_perm.dat and doesn't stop RR from saying ""Failed to check out a key for rose_enterprise_windows:
 FLEXlm Error -2, Invalid license file syntax OR no licenses in file' while offering to launch the dreaded license key administrator. Tonhaose, could you please address this?

Thanks,

Ed"
,tonhaosemacento,2008-03-11T16:55Z,"It Works for me:

Install notes
1) Run the setup, and choose install before licensing.
2) Put rational_server_perm.dat in C:Program FilesRationalCommon (or wherever you installed)
3) Enjoy!

You should install, run the program, close, and then replace the existing rational_server_perm.dat with the supplyied"
,longJohnMicrosoft,2008-03-27T00:11Z,"Look, you foreigners need to work together. Stop arguing amongst yourselves. You cant leave it up to our dear leader Bush to help you like we did in Iraq. Now those people have been given the gift of democracy and soon we will give them christianity. You too can have democracy and more huts and goats etc, but for goodness sake pull together, atleast till me have defeated those commies in Cuba"
,tj8,2008-05-06T03:45Z,"Hey, 

I downloaded & it works.

Our buddy, tonhaosemacento is from Brazil, I understand from what he told.

Just wondering where ewsi from ?

No flaming, just curious .. after reading the
the two different presentations on the same problem (low bandwidth)

thx"

""and soon we will give them christianity"" . 

Mr. Bush will have to spent more $$$$ than he spent on the war to get each Iraqi uncircumcised :) :) ...."
,Loua11,2008-08-10T21:53Z,"Ewsi, i'm wondering if you even know anything about you're country's history, i dont't think so, have never heard such ignorand bullshit"
,kleft,2008-10-17T02:36Z,"ewsi, you are  dick.

That is all."
,tpb_mvp,2009-06-22T11:38Z,"guys how far off from the latest version is this? anyway keeping seed people!

thanks tonhaosemacento"
,eventide,2010-10-12T09:03Z,"Huh??? The title is 

Rational Rose Enterprise Edition 7.7.0204.3001 Release Version 

but the file is:

RationalRoseEnterpriseEditionforWindows.2002.05.20.468.000.exe"
,akaismac,2011-06-27T18:35Z,"loool
bunch of idiots (no offense)
I also live in a ""3rd world country""
do i have the services that exist in japan or the US? NO
do i want them? HELL YEAH
do i bit** and whine about it all day long? NOT a chance, never and would never do it
i thank God for what i have, i try to perfection that all the time and we wille have it one day, just not today, and i live with what i have !
so stop whining, and forget about what u don't have for a while and think about all the things that u do have
if ur internet bandwidth pisses you off, throw ur laptop from the window, u can follow it if u want or just go for a walk, enjoy rio de janeiro beaches, or the amazon or an african jungle, it's paradise out there, God's creation better than anything u can ever find on the net
IT'S my OPINION, All i ask in return is to RESPECT it !"
,ixGltTrp,2011-07-13T21:01Z,"Why is everyone fighting with the uploader?? If you don't like it, FUCK OFF. The uploader made an effort so use it or shut the fuck up. @tonhaosemacento: thanks for the upload, much appreciated."
,xpra01,2011-10-13T22:50Z,"I suspect this content to contain rootkits. My system started to tell me ""explorer.exe"" has an invalid image file -- thanks to a rootkit of poor quality :P

Anyway, I resolved my problem with ComboFix which correctly reported an infection by Seneka. It was not detected by KAV, nor ""White bear"", nor ""BitDef""."
,MostafaMohammadi,2012-02-23T06:44Z,"@ewsi would you try to keep your mouth shut? Because every single word which comes out of it, smell like feces!
You must be so much idiot, because nobody compare himself to someone who doesn't have access to technology instead of comparing himself to someone who have a better access to technology!
It is like saying; â€œletâ€™s keep eating shit because some people donâ€™t even have shit to eat! People who want food can go to Japan! We are Brazilian, we eat shit!â€
I have never been at Brazil but I am pretty sure one of the reasons that this country didnâ€™t develop up yet, is existence of people like you. Would you do the other Brazilians a favor? Go to the top of a very high building and try to paint the sidewalk."
,MostafaMohammadi,2012-02-23T06:51Z,@tonhaosemacento Thank you
