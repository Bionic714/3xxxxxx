QUOTES FROM THIS DOCUMENTARY

??I will guarantee you that this evening and the information you?re about to hear will be the most staggering information you?ve ever heard in your life. And, I mean that sincerely. I?m speaking specifically to the press right now and I know many of you are involved in the day to day issues being how we dispose of our waste, or the guns in Toronto, or the war in Iraq. The bold statement that I have to make to you is every single issue?doesn?t matter what it is? pales in comparison to what your about to hear tonight?
