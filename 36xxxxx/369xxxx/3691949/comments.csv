,boxmer,2007-05-31T18:58Z,"Hey Kejllboy, try the other link i posted, that one works, don't know about this one"
,buell82,2007-07-25T03:55Z,"ight so i downloaded this and then used the 7zip to open the files (i highlighted all and then clicked on extract files) this normally works yet this time it created a image file that would open up automatically with nero and would only be a few mbs large this can't be the program. I did eventually pull up 7zip file manager and found all the folders but not matter which autorun or setup i click on it will not run (autorun has following file ext; bmp, ini, exe, & inf) (setup only has a exe file). someone please help me in getting this game to work ( i have plenty of dvd + R (4.7 gb ea.) to put it on"
,buell82,2007-07-25T04:11Z,i did burn the flt-3nc image file (opened upon extract) to a cd-r (it was only 500 something mbs large) but when i tried to open the cd a message came up saying missing install txt
,ragnahr,2008-03-04T13:16Z,great download speed until 76.3% then went down to 4-11 kb. was nearly 200kbs... a little confusing unpacking it ect but works fine great torrent
