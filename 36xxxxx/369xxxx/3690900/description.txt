 Latest SVN compiled with extra skins, few scripts and a bunch of codecs, tried to leave as clean as 
 possible but still have enough functionality 'Out of the Box' to be the full experience from an awesome 
 platform that is XBMC.

 Included are the latest version of the following skins from xbmcskins svn...

- CEOMR
- Clearity
- Containment *** NEW
- MC360
- PDM
- Project Mayhem I *** Removed
- Project Mayhem II *** Removed
- Project Mayhem III
- Project Mayhem III Lite *** Removed
- Vision
- Xbox-Classic
- xTV

 I have changed nothing just done a clean compile and added the above skins, any questions/bugs need to 
 goto the original authors.

Revision: 8922
Author: elupus
Date: 11:01:02 AM, Monday, May 14, 2007
Message:
changed: removed CanSeek() from filesystem, it was wrong in a few protocols and hardly used. Use Seek(0, SEEK_CUR) to check if protocol supports seeking.
added: buffering system to CFile (quite untested, set READ_BUFFERED flag on Open to use)
changed: move READ_TRUNCATED flag from CFile::Read to to CFile::Open as it is silly to pass along on each read request
