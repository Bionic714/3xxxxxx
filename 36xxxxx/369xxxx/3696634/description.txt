Here is how to apply the crack...it worked perfectly for me. 

1. Open the RAR file with Winrar or whatever you use. Go into the opened folder and install the program & restart your computer before applying anything. 

2. Go to the "Crack" folder and right-click and copy the "TMPGEncDVDAuthor3.exe" file. 

3. Go to C:/Program Files/Pegasys Inc/TMPGEnc DVD Author 3 with DivX Authoring and right-click on an empty space and click "paste"...a pop-up will ask you if you want to replace the other file with the newer one...click "YES" and then you can close that folder. 

4. Go back to the "Crack" folder and right-click & copy the "TMPGEncDVDAuthor3.en.lic" file and then go to C:/Documents and Setting/User/Application Data/Pegasys Inc/TMPGEncDVDAuthor3 folder and paste and replace the other file with the new one the same way you did with the other file...close the folder and you're good to go. 

Windows, by default, hides the "Application Data" folder so if you cannot see it, then go to "Tools" at the top of the folder & on the drop down menu click "Folder Options" then click on the "View" tab...go down and check the "Show hidden files and folders" option...click "Apply" and then "Ok"...you should now be able to see the "Application Data" folder. 

Another thing that you may find is that when you go to C:/Documents and Setting/user/Apllication Data/Pegasus Inc you may not see the "TMPGEncDVDAuthor3" folder which happened to me...all I did was start the TMPGEnc program and it will pop up wanting a serial number...after it pops up just exit the program and go back to the C:/Documents and Settings/user/Application Data/Pegusus Inc folder and you should now see the "TMPGEncDVDAuthor3" folder where you need to paste the "TMPGEncDVDAuthor3.en.lic" file...do that now and close the folder and you're all set. Also when I say C:/Documents and Settings/User
