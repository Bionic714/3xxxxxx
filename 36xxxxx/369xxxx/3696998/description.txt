New Young Pony Club's "Fantastic Playroom" Advance
--------------------------------------------------


Nice danceable tunes. This one isn't just for the teenie indie kids...


Cheers.

For the twats who commented previously about me talking sh1t

a) I just copied and pasted a review, its not ME talking sh1t

b) this was a pre-release "advance" for people to merely check this album out BEFORE PURCHASING THE REAL DEAL (OR FAV TRACKS OFF THE ALBUM) AS ALL GENUINE MUSIC LOVERS SHOULD

c) the low encode rate isn't up to me, but for all that it doesn't sound bad at all... it was a "scene" release, i just upped it, ffs.
