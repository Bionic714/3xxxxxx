,Rated-R-Superstar,2008-05-01T12:47Z,"Glad someone decided to tell us the tacks and Bit Rate, now I know not to waste my time with this low quaity shite. Anything below 192kbps is not worth having, you can hear the dfference easily, well I can."
,TuxXtreme,2008-07-11T11:53Z,"I agree to Rated-R-Superstar, It's lazy to rip at such a low bitrate. Do it at 320kb/s, and thos who are concerned of space can downgrade it (use GXTranscoder.net AWE). So long!"
