,NightZhai,2007-05-18T16:09Z,Are u sure that u r seeding 100mbit+? Because for me it's looks like no one is seeding :S
,420dopeman,2007-05-18T16:43Z,"not anymore , i only seed until completion of seed, its now up to your fellow mates.

dont like it? pick another torrent."
,orion70,2007-05-18T17:17Z,"why rippin? to save download-time and bandwith?

rippin games in DSL- and cabletimes, is as stupid as drive an electromobile in saudia arabia, to save petrol..

stop rippin, keep seeding!"
,420dopeman,2007-05-18T18:52Z,"orion70 , believe it or not mate, I've lived all over the world, and it would highly amaze you how many do not have high-speed bandwith. Actually , many do not even have rights to it. So before you go and make immature, uneducated comments, just try shutting the fuck up. How bout that you bag-o-dicks.

greeetz."
[V],Subzero!,2007-05-18T20:35Z,ya right there... but he is probably not able to handle  our releases...  Full Games are  easier to handle for him >>> iso > mount > autorun feature enabled etc. etc. l8er
,santo1989,2007-05-19T06:04Z,"Hey dopeman, you're pretty hot, and cool for releasing games that don't need to be installed. 

Now I take my external harddrive to school and play there for hours in the library and computer class :D (and watch movies/anime/porn)


I have a few games maybe you should have in mind.

Call of Duty
GTA San Andreas
Need For Speed (Carbon or Undergound2)
Flatout 2
UT2k4

Not demanding, just suggesting :)


Thanks and keep it coming, you're great for the pirate community."
,NightZhai,2007-05-19T12:04Z,Thx Dopeman ! This was a great game ^^. But still.... why isn't it possible to use a ''controller'' with this game? Or is it just me ? Im really feeling unconfortable playing with the keyboard.
,420dopeman,2007-05-19T14:34Z,"dunno, here what the in game read me say/:


Most DirectX compatible with at least 12 buttons game controllers with 2 analogue sticks can be used to play Black Buccaneer. 
Please ensure that you have the latest drivers for your controller before playing the game. Visit your hardware manufacturer's website for details.  
Please refer to the game launcher to determine the operation of these bindings.
