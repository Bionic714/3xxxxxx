Each edition of Wee Sing offers younger viewers a chance to sing along with both animals and people, and learn some valuable lessons along the way. In this program, Laurie and Scott follow their beloved basset hound Barney to Sillyville, where even the rocks and trees have songs to sing. Through the use of song, the Wee Sing gang reconcile the different groups in Sillyville and get everyone following the same tune.
