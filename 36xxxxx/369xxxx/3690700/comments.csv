Chris Cornell did the main theme for Casino Royale, called ""You Know My Name"""
,peter@norrtaljebowling.nu,2007-05-29T19:28Z,Chris Cornell is the former singer of Soundgarden and Audioslave. In my opinion one the best voices around. 
,gvegas,2007-06-06T19:30Z,"Chris Cornell rules!

The best ever is the collaboration of his voice and Eddie Vedder's voice in Hungerstrike..."
,johnnyfacker2,2007-06-10T18:21Z,"Correction, Chris Cornell USED to be good. That was 15 years ago. This album is possibly the saddest attempt at a comeback i've seen, This music does not even compare to his earlier stuff, this is just mainstream crap!"
,atticusmalmo,2007-06-17T13:32Z,"When Chris is in a Band his shit is great but these solo albums are really shit.Soundgarden=Awesome,Temple of the Dog-Fantastic,Audioslave=Not Bad."
