This is the Super Grub Rescue Disk. 

Use this when all else fails. Can install/remove grub from MBR, fix damaged mbr's, Linux, Windows, it does not matter, can boot directly off cd or boot existing partitions when that late-night install fest has left your mbr's hosed. If it has data it can probably be booted by this cd. A stunning addition (if not replacement) to your rescue cd collection. Enjoy.
