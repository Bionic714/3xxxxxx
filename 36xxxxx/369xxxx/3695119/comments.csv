,Dans1989,2007-06-01T12:15Z,seed plz
,boostdemon,2007-06-18T19:44Z,"how can you be the seeder and havent downloaded it?  

you've got 75 people waiting to seed this crap... please, just suck it up for a day or two till we're done."
,cyan1320,2007-07-07T21:40Z,also anyone have parts 1 and 2?
,Bamimi,2007-07-14T21:47Z,"all three parts are in this. it isnt part 3 of it, it is '3 part' of it."
,Bamimi,2007-07-14T21:55Z,"we seem to all be stuck at 71.1% here for days.....I've gotten a number of your uploads bunje, actually all the airbrush stuff I think, but this torrent, is taking quite awhile to finish, and there hasnt been much progress lately. you do realize if you can get it to some of us, we can then seed it all and finish it rather then you having to upload bits and pieces of 10 different files all the time right? start the seed, let it finish for a few people, then move on to something else. after your done with that something else, then you can always go back to the original seeds if they need support. (I still think your doing a bang up job though and way great for putting these out for us, btw. thank you very much as always.) but let us help you seed. its what p2p is all about. is we all have the same parts of the files it doesnt do any good at all using a distributed fileshare system."
,cyan1320,2007-07-15T22:28Z,thanks Bamimi
,cyan1320,2007-07-15T22:29Z,"still stuck at 71.2% and uploading, but no downloading :("
,diesl12,2007-07-16T01:48Z,I'm also stuck at 71.1% and have been uploading the crap out of this torrent.  Does anyone know why it has stalled?  Is their anything we can do to help out?
,alljunkandcrap,2007-07-16T22:06Z,"Yeah, I'm stuck on 71.1% too.  All we need is a little bit more, then there will be plenty of seeds"
