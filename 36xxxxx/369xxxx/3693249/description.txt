Facts of the group:

Runrig is a six-piece band, originating mostly from the Western Isles of Scotland. It performs a mixture of Gaelic and English-spoken songs, almost all of which is written by the band. The music is not as well known south-of-the-border as it might be, though in Scotland and in parts of continental Europe the band has a large and dedicated following. 

The lead singer with the band, Bruce Guthro, is the only non-Scottish member, originating from Cape Breton, Nova Scotia, Canada. After 19 years with the band, the previous lead singer Donnie Munro left to pursue other interest in the fields of arts and politics. Donnie left the band after a set of concerts which culminated in a major farewell event at Stirling Castle on 28th, 29th and 30th August. Needless to say the nights were all sell-outs, and the atmosphere on the final night was absolutely electric, and very emotional for all. Donnie will be sadly missed from the line-up, but the band will continue, and the new singer, Bruce, will ensure its success for the next twenty years....
