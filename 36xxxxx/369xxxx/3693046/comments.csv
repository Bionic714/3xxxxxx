,giraffi,2007-05-22T04:02Z,What the hell? Is this different from the other torrent? You don't need a piratebay account to seed a torrent that's already on here! Goddamnit!
,mmmmmicke,2007-06-25T17:49Z,"please help, i have installed and everything but when i'm going to play it says ""Please insert the correct DVD-ROM, select OK and restart application"" what am i supposed to do?"

,eideideid,2007-07-13T16:31Z,"the serial is 9S5V-8WAZ-RMRV-CST5-HRLD ..
but where do i find the fucking crack???"
,Daasson,2007-08-30T12:01Z,Where is the crack????????
,Daasson,2007-08-30T12:29Z,"Ok, i found out where the crack is..

1. Mount the torrent and install the game
2. Go to winrar and click on the adres balk down.. so you can the hardware etc.
3. Choose where you've mounted it
4. You see the crack

I don't know how to use it yet soo
and sorry for my bad english"
,Daasson,2007-08-30T12:38Z,"O.k. when you've found the crack jsut drag it to the map where you've installed it. Than choose yes.

It works great thanks man great torrent"
,thacause,2007-09-19T13:14Z,"THX!

the game works GREAT!"
,Diozakrod,2007-09-19T14:06Z,"Hmm, am I missing something? People say ""Mount the image"" but I see no Iso, or any other image file anywhere in these folders. Also, when I run the setup, I see ""Windows cannot find 'medal of honor pacific assaulttm_code.exe'. make sure you typed the name correctly, and then try again. to search for a file, click the start button, and then click search.""

Never had this much trouble installing a game before D:"
,Diozakrod,2007-09-19T15:00Z,"Never mind, I'm an idiot. Game works perfect so far."
,kaso01,2007-10-09T23:13Z,"Can somebody help me with this - when I run setup this window appears - ""Windows cannot find 'medal of honor pacific assaulttm_code.exe'. make sure you typed the name correctly, and then try again. to search for a file, click the start button, and then click search."" And then this window appears - ""The registration number was not correct. Installation cannot continue. I have no idea what to do with it..."
,fallout11,2007-11-15T03:24Z,"Works great!  Thanks! 
Download, unrar, mount the .iso with Daemon tools (or whatever you prefer), and install.
Another working serial is: 
SNLU-BAMU-LP3L-KSFE-JRLD
You can get a crack at gamecopyworld.com (for v1.0), as well."
,biggiz,2007-12-31T15:19Z,how long i take for it to download if it download 10kb/S  all the time? =P
,Tungruffel,2008-01-05T19:48Z,It should be a MoH icon on the CD if you burned it. Copy it and past in the folder where you find the other icon on your computer...
,Epp0,2008-01-07T18:38Z,Hi. so it works ferfect? :)  :)

,sisk-o,2008-01-23T15:16Z,"""O.k. when you've found the crack jsut drag it to the map where you've installed it. Than choose yes.""
