Jakten på Storrödingen, part 1 of 3

A Swedish fishing show about charr fishing in the northern part of the world.
An interesting show, shown on TV2.


Due to some antenna problems the picture freezes in certain parts, but the sound keeps on, a little annoying.
Sorry for slow upload.

Should be able to seed the remaining parts if anyone is interested?




If anyone has any other Swedish fishing shows or movies, please seed.
