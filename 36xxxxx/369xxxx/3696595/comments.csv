First, you need HDTVPump:

And then (At least for any HD-DVD releases by HDTV_CHINA i have) you need Matroska Splitter

You will also need to have a MPEG2 decoder previously installed. NVIDIA's works. If you can play a DVD - chances are you have a valid decoder.

Install those and report back!"

I've viewed HDTV China's releases before so I don't think they are MPAA fakes, but every tool I've used says there is no MPEG2 Stream like an MPAA fake.  I've tried 2k, XP, OSX, media player classic, vlc, wmp11+sdk, video Redo, NOTHING plays any video.  The link for codec downloads fails to complete.  
IF the codec works, please include it in the torrent.  Thanks."

thnx! getting both sound and images.

only problem is that video is lagging after sound
but that may be because of my comp hardware
which is about 3 years old."
,stardude,2007-05-30T20:00Z,"!!NOTE!! I installed FinalCodecs and suddenly the sound was gone in the movie =\\

uninstalled FinalCodecs and reinstalled HDTVPump and Matroska but no go =~(

SUGGESTION: start with HDTVPump and Matroska.
if you get image and sound then DON'T install the FinalCodecs pack."
