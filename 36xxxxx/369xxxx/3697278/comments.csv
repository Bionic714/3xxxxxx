,Dr.R.Kimball,2007-06-25T00:02Z,"Danger, I started to download this game and received notification from my ISP that  DMCA infringements had happened and if I did not erase this I would have my Internet connection disable. 

therefore someone is watching!"
,vesper8,2007-07-22T00:36Z,"thanks but has anyone figured out how to get passed the ""Freya"" track ? Whenever I hover above it it just freezes the game.. I have all the tracks unlocked but ever since I unlocked the 8th group I can't get passed the 3rd song in the 5th group anymore (freya) it just crashes if I try... "
,skunkyg420,2007-08-18T18:38Z,"For some reason all these dvds that come from this soti guy play in black and white.;
If anyone knows how to fix this problem, please let me know. 
When I play my swap disk it works fine, but as soon as I put in the game to load it plays black n white.
The game also freezes on Freya, but if you scroll past it real quick you can avoid it.
 Somebody help!!"
