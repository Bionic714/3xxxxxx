,glennster74,2007-06-17T14:59Z,"I have spent nearly 3 weeks downloading this baby. I extract the video_ts folder from the ISO, but when trying to compress with DVDShrink, it says the file structure is corrupt/invalid. It might be one file that is wrong. Any ideas what to do? Can it only be burned as a DL disc? "
