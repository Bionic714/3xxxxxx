Hey, this is Lion Whom; I suppose you\'re downloading a torrent file of my album \'Cheese, I thought you said BEES!\' by The Menstrels. As of now, all of this stuff is free, it\'s not something I intend to make money from. If you want to learn more, check out the page myspace.com/themenstrels or email me at ihateryanhume(at)gmail.com. Please send any comments etc, I like to hear anything (since no one listens in the first place)
