This is a re-seed of (http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3593050/Terminator_2__Judgment_Day_(Ultimate_Edition)_Disc_1)  because there seem to be no seeders left. Unfortunately I don't have the DVD9 version any more so here is the DVD5 version instead. There are no menus, no extras and only DD5.1EX and english subtitles for best possible quality.
