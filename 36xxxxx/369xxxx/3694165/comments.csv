I really don`t like waiting alot of hours and sometimes days to finish a download this size only to find when its finished that whatever space geek who uploaded it decided to do some adjustments to a file that was fine to begin with and fucked up the audio and or video. why can`t you assholes upload the movie as is and leave it the fuck alone?!!"

This user is presenting the DVD in its 'almost' natural state.  Go spend some money on a real hard drive you piece of shit, fucking cheapskate.  Better yet, go buy the fucking movie."
