Noosphere is the result of five experienced musicians who formed the band they were all searching for. This brought together a group of artists who had been admiring one another's musical abilities while playing the same circuit. In doing so, they create a well balanced fusion of heavy, progressive rock with accessible melodies and hooks. 

Noosphere has shared the stage with many national acts such as Slayer, Breaking Benjamin, Killswitch Engage, Mastodon, (HeD)pe, Saliva, Systematic, Stereomud, Mushroomhead, Dope, and Silvertide. 

The band is proud to be sponsored by Jägermeister and to have played on the '03, '04 and '05 JägerMusic Tours. Noosphere also officially endorses a number of companies and their products - namely, Line6, Digitech, Diezel, Salwender Amplification, Vigier Guitars, Digital Music Corp., Voodoolab, Rocktron, WHITEBOY Clothing, Seymour Duncan, and 9mmSFX.
