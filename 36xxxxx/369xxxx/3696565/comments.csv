First, you need HDTVPump:

And then (At least for any HD-DVD releases by HDTV_CHINA i have) you need Matroska Splitter

You will also need to have a MPEG2 decoder previously installed. NVIDIA's works. If you can play a DVD - chances are you have a valid decoder.

Install those and report back!"

I've viewed HDTV China's releases before so I don't think they are MPAA fakes, but every tool I've used says there is no MPEG2 Stream like an MPAA fake.  I've tried 2k, XP, OSX, media player classic, vlc, wmp11+sdk, video Redo, NOTHING plays any video.  The link for codec downloads fails to complete.  
IF the codec works, please include it in the torrent.  Thanks."
,rc71,2007-05-31T16:57Z,"Crap! It DOES Work.
Reinstall a few hundred times and it DOES work.
A nice little write up with the needed software
would probably be a good idea. It would speed
up the torrent too as more people share it.

Instructions to make it work.

1) Reinstall KMPlayer

2) Reinstall Windows media Player 11

3) Reinstall MatroskaSplitter

I also had CCCP and KLCodec paks installed,
but I don't know if they are essential for this."
,weezl,2009-02-07T00:05Z,"to play:
1. uninstall ALL (crap) codecs
2. install cccp"

ALL hd movies released, download and install ffdshow, download and use media player classic.

Two very small programs totaling i think less than 10mb for both. that's ALL YOU EVER NEED.

if anything doesn't work with ffdshow and mpc then it's dubbed wrong, in a bad format, and shouldn't even be bothered with in the first place."
