,niceworkbuddy,2010-01-05T22:12Z,"yea, ignore uberwolf, the ungreateful tit! I have been collecting 'Gods' rare work for 15 years now. It's a good job this was not available 10 years ago because I probably would have died.... Jim Steinman is the best kept secret in all of music. 
""Every golden nugget coming like a gift from the gods, Steinman must have blessed us when he gave us those songs"""
