,something15525,2007-06-01T09:07Z,"can u just download this software, burn an wii game iso and just play it on the wii without like even installing a modchip or anything?"
,mega_lucas,2007-06-01T18:33Z,u need a modchip of course!
,young-digger,2007-06-05T11:08Z,"Right... being a complete novis i need to ask some dumb questions. However I feel that the answers might help a lot of people who find themselves in my situation. I have read so much information on the web and it all seems to have gotten complicated.

1) I have just purchased a wii and I will get it chipped with a Wiikey... is this the best modkey to have?

2) Once I have this modded wii, can I then simply save wii games that are iso files and burn them using a standard dvd writable drive and standard burning software. (for back up purposes of course)

3) Do i need a special LG dvd rom, or is this only required for backing up my own wii games that I have purchased?

4) Do i need special DVD-R or DVD+R disc's, i currently use verbatim.

5) Is there any advice about writing speed?

6) my wii is a PAL, once my wiikey is installed, can i also download and play other region games?

I would very much appreciate it if someone could answer the above questions based on experience."

You will require a special LG drive to rip isos from wii games

Also once it is ripped you will need a second drive ( any good DVD drive) to write the DVD"

Somebody told them or showed them. So don't feel bad for asking questions. If we all sucked as much dick as these 2 donut punchers, maybe we could be as perfect as they are!"

,gazgaz,2007-09-09T00:05Z,"I have also just bought my wii
and had it chipped; then told it is not the same as copying PS2 games; you must have a LG burner and software and some upgrades from NTSC may brick your machine
I looked on the googles and they simply do not answer all the questions easily; so you come here for help from friendlies"
,piratenno1,2007-09-11T00:10Z, I had to use my asus burner (an older one) instead of my LG. And it works like a charm. It did not work with my LG
,boxingchief,2007-09-13T22:56Z,Hey Piratenno1....suck my dick you fuckin cocksucker. Google dosen't  give you all the answers your looking for. And if your so concerned. why did you answer gazgaz's question? Dumb ass motherfucker!
,piratenno1,2007-09-16T19:11Z,"Hey assface, google did give me all the answers so fuck you. Maby you should learn to use google first. Im not gay as you are so suck our own dick."
,piratenno1,2007-09-17T21:16Z,"Off course does the google itself not give you the answer, its just a link between the question and answer."
,piratenno1,2007-09-17T21:17Z,Off course does google itself not give you the answer. Its just a link between the question and the answer.
,boxingchief,2007-09-18T14:24Z,"Remember when you said ""you don't know shit about any shit"". Well you got that right....ya fag. And don't worry about being gay. It's acceptable these day's even for super fags like you...lol "

,djtdon,2007-12-09T00:54Z,"where can i buy a wiikey? 


and are they easy to put into the wii 

cus with the 360 you need a special screwdriver and all sorts just to open it"

,evolutionG,2008-01-31T16:43Z,Brun with Alcohol 120 % fucking newbies.
,rockdiedout,2008-02-14T05:21Z,"hahah. what's with all the hostility?

you don't need any special burner to burn wii games.

you don't need any special burning software to burn wii games.

use nero burning rom.

alcohol 120% sucks ass. no vista support."
,GizmoTheGreen,2008-02-17T22:09Z,"i dont recommend wiikey.
if you have dms/d2a or d2b chipsets, get YAOSM its free.
play games for free, dont pay for it (you pay wiikey to be able to play games for free, see the logic?)

also im using alcohol 120% on Vista, no problems.
i mostly use nero though.

if you want to play SSBB import from japan, imgburn is the only origram you can use, where you can specify where the second layer starts."
,rockdiedout,2008-02-20T12:19Z,eh. you get what you pay for. alcohol 120% still sucks because there's no point to using it when there's nero.
,blastermaster728,2008-03-08T19:33Z,"Jesus fucking christ.
All of you guys who are getting pissed about this need to chill out.
Don't be such greedy pussies saying ""I ain't tellin u lol"" because that's just retarded and flawed logic right thar.  Think about it dumbasses, the more people you have doing this (sadly I haven't actually chipped my Wii yet, I just wanted to see if Brawl was up somehow (it's not) and came across this shitstorm) anyways... the more people who are DLing the games, the more eventual seeders (if they're not douches).

In conclusion, all you need to do is build up good karma by answering newbie's questions, and then teach them that hit and runs are BAD."
,mark3429,2008-03-18T05:25Z,hey thanks that was really perfect to burn wii games excellent.
,furtherdown,2008-05-24T11:24Z,"To all the people who have been living in caves like Bin Laden in the last several years and don't know what a modchip is:

Wikipedia, Afterdawn forums and Google are your friends.  How do you think most people learned this shit?  Some people have friends who do more than just push their wheelchairs around.  Other people have to read up on different forums to learn what they know.  Then there's the third group, the people who learn through trial and error, and have a lot of money to keep buying new Wii's and blank DVD's to replace the ones they destroy."
,NoMadValues,2008-06-07T18:43Z,"Ok, Now that everyone is done bitching about stupid shit.

Today I went to buy a copy of Guitar Hero: Aerosmith in a store, then I came back home and tried to play. But there was a problem I runed the game and a update appeared so I made it and it worked so far. but when i run the game it appears:  Error: 001, The game failed to launch because of an unwanted device. I then had to plug off the wii. PLEASE HELP ME! My e-mail is: juanmartinst@hotmail.com"
,TheTreesurgeon,2008-12-03T04:21Z,Calm down people.  We are all here to do the same thing.  Those that want to scream go to your window and jump.  The rest help each other and the world is good.  THX for the up dude.
,pyrorite,2008-12-05T06:13Z,"piratenno1, who the fuck are you? Another stupid ass bitch who has nothing better to do than to openly display his ignorance by putting down others. The bay is a community you ass wipe, keep your shit talking to yourself. Nobody else wants to hear it.

,kyliecoast,2009-12-24T15:10Z,"The easiest way to make backup copies of your wii games:

1.	Download DVD Dumper v1.2 or above from internet.
2.	Put SD Card in computer
3.	Copy the DVD Dumper program to its own folder under apps and rename it to boot.dol.
4.	Go into homebrew channel, find the DVD Dumper program and run it. Select wifi for your download method. Your wiis ip address is shown
5.	Type this address into a web browser on your computer
6.	Confirm the download (XXXX.iso) and choose to save it to your normal download folder. Download will take a few hours."
