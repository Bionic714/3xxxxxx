[re:jazz] (re:mix) (2003) 

The success of INFRACom! pres.[re:jazz] in 2002 was strengthened a year later by [re:jazz] (re:mix) which brought the jazz arrangements back to the clubs with remixes by Bugge Wesseltoft, Nicola Conte, Jazztronik, Dublex Inc., and many more. The result is fantastic!

Electronica Meets Jazz! To celebrate the first ten years of INFRACom! Records, the reknowned German label, asked the German jazz trio "[re:jazz]" to create pure acoustic jazz interpretations of select electronica tracks from the INFRACom! catalog spanning the past decade.  Taking the concept a step further, they asked a global array of producers to remix the new acoustic versions and the result is [re:jazz] (re:mix).  Every remix is a unique piece of music with jazz breathing out of every tune. From techno to reggae, each remixer gives the tracks his own personal stamp, in some cases adding vocals to original instrumentals. This album which will surely appeal to electronica and jazz purists alike.  Supported by international DJs such as Simon Harrison, Michael R?tten (Soulpatrol), Nik Weston, Patrick Forge, David Borsu, Kyoto Jazz Massive and Rainer Tr?by. Remix artists include Nicola Conte, Swell Session, Yukihiro Fukutomi, Dublex Inc., Bugge Wesseltoft, Les Gammas, Akufen and more.
