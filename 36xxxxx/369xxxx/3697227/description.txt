Righteous and nationalist martial artist Hung Hei-Kwun (Yen) has always idolized his hero, the mysterious "Red Dragon"--leader of the Sun Moon Sect who conspired against the Ching Dynasty. Much to Hei-Kwun's surprise, however, Red Dragon turns out to be his own father, Hung Ting-Nam, who has been plotting to murder the current Ching Emperor. But when Ting-Nam's plan fails, he is killed and the Sun Moon Sect dismantled. Vowing to regroup, Hei-Kwun travels to Shaolin Temple to advance his kung fu and avenge his father's death.

Filmed on location in China and filled with impressive, authentic fight scenes choreographed by Donnie himself, The Kung Fu Master is a grandiose, mega-budget martial arts blockbuster hit for all ages!
