My private collection with original release files as far back as 7-8 years ago
this collection has been moved from hard drive to hard drive during my 10 year old history with this band. Mixed quality sounds and video, these are NOT ripped by me. to whoever did, cheers!

If you have any new (or old!) videos or conserts, i beg you please send me an email and/or a torrent for me to download as a price for this release, its all i ask for.
