This is a tribute Mickstape to my mentor. The greatest Hip Hop producer in the world hands down. DJ Premier aka Primo from Gang Starr. I have been DJing, and producing myself for about 20 years. His skill and creativity has inspired me on many of my projects. I made this tribute album a couple of years ago but never released it. Only gave it out to a few friends to turn them on to Primo. Now I want to share this gem with the world.

Support underground Hip-Hop.

Love,
DJ Shamrock
