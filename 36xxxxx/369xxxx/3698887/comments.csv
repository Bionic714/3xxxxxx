,Deadend_deadend,2008-02-27T08:53Z,"I've always kind of casually looked for this in used CD bins at record stores, but I never found it. I was glad to get it here, finally. Rushmore is one of the few movies I could watch any number of times, over and over again. This soundtrack looks great; I'm happy to get it for that Faces track alone, not to mention some of the other classics. I don't know that I'm sold on Mothersbaugh yet, but I'll give it a few more listens. Thanks for the upload, and I'll keep seeding many times over. D-D"
