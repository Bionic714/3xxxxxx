========================================

In this particular production instead of two warring towns, one town juggles and one town does not. With a cast of professional jugglers acrobats, and musicians (including Avner the Eccentric and the Kamikaze Ground Crew), the Flying Karamazov Brothers created a happy hilarious comic spectacle that remained true to the original script while somehow seamlessly inserting anachronistic pop culture references, bad jokes, and vaudeville wherever possible.
