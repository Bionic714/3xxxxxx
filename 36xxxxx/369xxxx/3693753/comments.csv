Any suggestions?"

,Kilolito,2008-05-12T12:14Z,for vista u have to put the crack in the download directory then right click it and run it as administrator
,thawk72,2008-05-26T12:21Z,The WinPcap executable included in this setup contains a trogan.
,bzrwon,2008-09-24T10:20Z,"Ok as I've posted many a time, before you noobs go around posting that there is virus or malware in a program, do these first, either update your AV databases or your AVs, or learn some basic coding. I scanned this with Kaspersky 09 and Nod32 and Superantispyware, 0 viruses, 0 malware, even if they did pick up something, chances are it's a false +, as most cracks/keygens/patches have trace elements of trojans (normally of the win32 variant).
Seriously it's nice that the noobs are trying to warn ppl but at the same time, if all you are relying on is your avs without having some basic knowledge about coding, just don't post and leave it to the ppl that have a remote idea about what they're talking about, this upload is SAFE, thankyou Zedith"
,Newb787,2008-09-28T22:44Z,"Thanks Zedith, I am downloading right now.  Hopefully it works to record streaming radio.

Cheers."
,taberg07,2008-10-09T17:18Z,"Thanks - I've been looking for this! 

BTW, newb787, for recording streaming audio I've been using free audiograbber - works fine."

,dmcrun,2010-06-03T18:51Z,"Downloaded, Installed and Tested. Works 100%!

1.) Install
2.) Run Crack. Give crack your installation directory. ""C:\Program Files\Replay AV 8""
3.) Run and enjoy.

Remember Vista users, run crack as administrator.

Thanks Zedith!"
