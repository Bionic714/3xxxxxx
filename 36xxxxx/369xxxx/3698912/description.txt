Review
'60s psych, shoegaze, Kraut-rock - there's plenty of musical influences swirling around in this Chicago-based duo's debut. Songs About Music is a pulsing romp of a long-player, with just enough meta-music intellect, drones, and guitar fuzz to keep our synapses firing and our toes tapping. --XLR8R 

Product Description
This is the new album from Coltrane Motion, two small-town Ohio expatriates now residing in Chicago. Lead singer Michael Bond records sixties- obsessed electronic pop in his home studio, while guitarist Matt Dennewitz covers it all in wailing distortion and delay at their live shows - the result is a raucous wall of sound built out of drum loops and fuzzed-out melodies, held together by swirling synths and organ drones. It's an indie rock dance record that doesn't follow the DFA/NME template, leaning more on 90s shoegazers and 60s soul jams than the usual post-punk roll call.
