,Steelhaven,2007-05-27T18:02Z,fake... not JKR's writing style.. so obvious with its lousy lines and crappy dialogues.. even has wrong spellings.. hehe
,Knock_out,2007-05-27T18:13Z,thx... haf to wait untill juli 21.. I guess.. :-(
,shypys,2007-05-28T12:14Z,"More comments would have been appreciated, after all 185 people have downloaded it. Seems like people just want you to get the 2.2 MBs and see for  yourself. OK. but since ""1"" person has told that this is not the real thing, I'm sure that it's a fan fic."
,cycada,2007-05-28T21:45Z,"This is not the real deal! I have read all the books so far, several times! this is NOT J.K Rowling. one Chapter and you are deadly sure! by the way.. the book is 298 pages... her last 3 books take half my bookcase ffs..."
,ggrant,2007-05-30T18:17Z,I have read it and it is not bad.. But I am not sure that it is the real thing.. But the storyline is ok.
,savyandjoe,2007-06-01T06:04Z,"It surely isn't JKR but it's not horrible. Rather boring sometimes, but for 2mbs its not a bad read. "
,alainjroy,2007-06-05T09:05Z,Not bad but not real either. The ending with Petunia using magic is the biggest giveaway as JKR has stated without a doubt that Petunia would never use magic or have that ability.
,martinbogo,2007-06-12T10:32Z,"This is the seventh in the series written by  ""Harry Writer."" known for creating a long standing harry potter fan fiction.  This is, of course, not the real thing."
,liffer,2007-06-30T03:43Z,"Yeah, definite fake."
