As the original torrent maker I have put it up  and hopefully you get it"
,raindr0ps,2008-02-17T23:58Z,"Yo, isrxjs, thanks for the upload. I have several older John Fahey released on CD. Will try to upload soon. 

BTW, that first torrent you uploaded can be deleted but you have to do it. After logging on, find the torrent and in the upper right-hand corner you'll see a small red ""x"" that will delete it. Good luck."
