Great job, if you don't know to speak Portuguese, i wrote that in this language. =)"
,gabbyheinze,2007-06-06T02:40Z,"damn...ruy guerra's 1st flick...this is HUGE !
i never thought i d get to see that one...
many thanks to u kegir !
finished loading it,n the rip is nicer than just ""watchable"" too...
anyones got ""os fuzis""/""the guns"",also by guerra,w/eng or french subs ?? id love to see that one again...
also request to brazilians out there : im looking for flicks by beto brant (other than ""o invasor"")...any luck ?    cheers   "
,kegir,2007-06-07T20:44Z,"@ gabbyheinze, If I make you so happy for the film
it is all worth the upload. Actually the tv rip is good as you say. I have a rip of Os fuzis aka The guns but unfortunately without subtitles and from Beto Brant I only have O invasor so that wont do any good. "
