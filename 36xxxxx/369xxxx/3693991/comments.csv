,t006577a,2007-05-22T05:41Z,"This file is compressed in ZIX format, and WinZix, the program required to decompress it, contains a trojan.

DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS FILE!  If you've already downloaded it, STOP SEEDING and run a virus scan!"
[T],Jesper.sv,2007-05-22T06:00Z,"Great show, cant wait for next season =)
I have ep24 ;P .. But only 1Mbit upload (~70-80kb/s) so it wont be woth uploading."
,michael316,2007-05-22T06:14Z,Thanks to t006577a  for the heads-up.
,nightsongz2,2007-05-22T08:25Z,"It's in RAR files, t006577a, you moron. Don't say shit like that because people will miss out on this episode or have to find it somewhere else. WINRAR opened it just fine...like any other RAR file."
,t006577a,2007-05-22T08:57Z,It's a ZIX file within a RAR file.
,t006577a,2007-05-22T09:03Z,My apologies to nightsongz2; he is right.  I commented on this torrent by mistake.
,nightsongz2,2007-05-22T09:46Z,"I will agree, though, that people have been uploading shows that do contain the ZIX file but this isn't one."
,siquo,2007-05-22T10:21Z,"this one is fine.
