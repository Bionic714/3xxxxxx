,smorchie,2007-11-23T13:18Z,the nrg file can be opened with daemon tools.  It's an image file.  There is a problem with the game though.  It asks for a play cd.  Took over a fucking week to download this file and couldn't even get it to work.

,SindaCelva,2007-12-29T12:13Z,"It is asking for another cd, how do you make the game play?"
[T],xenfreak,2008-07-13T02:09Z,"ok, so i finally got this game to work. for those of you who want to get this to work, download my torrent here:

http://thepiratebay.org/tor/4289444/The_Chronicles_of_Riddick__escape_from_butcher_bay_Patch_and_Cra

follow all of the directions and it will work for you like it did for me.

i was actually going to repack and reupload the iso but my uplaod sucks to much to do that.

oh, and this game doesn't have any trojans in it(false positive most likely)

well whatever, i won't be complaining if you guys don't download my torrent :shrugs: less wasted bandwith on my part :D "
