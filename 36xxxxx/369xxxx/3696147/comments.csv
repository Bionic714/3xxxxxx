,amaranthus,2007-06-07T22:51Z,178 downloads and only 1 seed? ...
,amaranthus,2007-06-07T22:55Z,"Sorry, I couldn't help it.. I'm not blaming you in any way though.."
,brownhouse,2007-06-10T22:45Z,"i know amaranthus, its no problem what you said anyway. I'm not sure but the tracker might announce the torrent as downloaded even if people only download part of the torrent beccause there client would announce that the torrent is complete as they may have only selected to dowload say the last two episodes? I don't know just a theory. My ratio is also now more than 1.2 yet with only a reported 9.6% out there how annoying anyway i'm still chugging on!"
,brownhouse,2007-06-13T10:06Z,"hey dl'ers good news is that i'm getting a faster broadband connecction so i faster upload for you guys. but this leads to some bad news that i will not be online until the new provider is conneted to me, 8-10 days it sucks sorry but there you go. Keep trying and keep sharing i'll be back asap."
