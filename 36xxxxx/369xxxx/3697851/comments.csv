,ricky006,2007-05-27T10:56Z,"Please , We need more SEEDS. Thanx"
,novem212005,2007-05-27T12:52Z,Yea we need more seeders.
,ricky006,2007-05-27T18:01Z,"Still no seeds , stuck at 14.5 %"
,EvilCreature,2007-05-27T19:33Z,"Just be patient, I'm trying to upload as much as I can. It's just my upload as well as download speed sucks on torrents, and my ISP is not the greatest, although it is better than Dial-Up.

I'm going to keep the upload running as long as possible, but I hope that someone else will be able to seed this as well.

I am sorry for any inconveniences.

This is my first time making a torrent and sharing something, so as I said I apologize.

If anyone else can seed this that has the game, I'd appreciate it. Thank You."
,ricky006,2007-05-27T23:50Z,"we can only seed when we have the full torrent 1st u need to seed 1.1 then i will take over 
 thank you any way "
,novem212005,2007-05-28T00:29Z,Yea seed until more people have the file and I can take over to and help seed too.
,kutcher,2007-05-28T10:44Z,"first of all Thank you EvilCreature.. this is great game..
and since your upload speed resembles mine you can always use SUPER SEEDING
this is to upload the missing parts first to the swarm to make distributed copy..
then the peers can go on without seeders (you currently).. and then we 'll go on from there for seeding..
you can use ÂľTorrent for thid purpose.. if you get confused check the faq.. but it is really THAT simple
GOOD WORK......"
,kutcher,2007-05-28T19:07Z,"Hey EvilCreature.. How it is going????
I'm concerned about this progress.. first day like 15% and the 2nd 18% total....
If you can't keep it running or something, I'll appreciate telling right now.. ok!
And it was great trying to share what you got with others.. Thanks."
,EvilCreature,2007-05-28T19:46Z,"I'm trying my best to keep you all informed, so heres the reason why:

I am on a Satellite ISP (Hughesnet) that imposes a strict Fair Access Policy. Since I exceeded my alloted Bandwidth for the day, I was in Fap mode for 24 hours and my speeds dropped to less than that of Dial-Up rendering my internet useless for 12 - 24 hours.

My Download/Upload speed in Kilobits is 512 - 768 Download and about 128 - 256 Upload in Kilobits. Also My Modem is Nat'd to death, which results in poor Upload/Download speeds in Torrents.

I am trying my best, and will keep the upload running as long as possible.

I would appreciate it once you download the file, if you can keep seeding it for a while.

It would also help if you posted what percent of your download is finished, and if the folder the files are saved to on your PC contain the:
Readme.txt, Resident Evil 4 (PC) USA.mdf, and Resident Evil 4 (PC) USA.mds files, so that way I know if there is a problem on my end with uploading."
,EvilCreature,2007-05-28T21:29Z,"Yes, I've enabled ""Super Seeding"".

I am using the Bitspirit torrent Client, for my uploads and downloads since it seems to be faster with my connection than utorrent.

I've seen people say, that they haven't really seen much torrents for the PC Version of RE4, so I decided to post a torrent of my copy which I received Thursday last week.

Just a note, the PC version of RE4 is inferior to the PS2 and Gamecube versions (Fuk'ing people who ported it messed up), but the USA version was Pre-Patched before hitting retail store shelves so it didn't look as horrible. 

This game does require a Geforce 6xxx series of card or better or it will lag like hell. Even on my Geforce 6150LE and Athlon64 X 2 3800+@2.0 Ghz I get noticeable slowdowns at 800x600 Resolution, and FPS were slow as hell when I tried playing on my older rig with a Geforce FX 5500."
,kutcher,2007-05-28T22:12Z,"Thank you.. now we 'll just wait to play one of the greatest games EVER..
and BitSpirit is fine.. I used it for a while..
and you are right.. are that's out there is the Eur Version..
for the best Experience for playing this game I recommend to you those addons..
the MouseAim (definitely)..
Keyboard Button Replacement (v2)
Hi-Res Cut-Scenes...

NOW.. it's great on the PC too.."
,kutcher,2007-05-28T22:17Z,"I can't post the links
""Database error.""
I'm figuring it out.."
,kutcher,2007-05-28T22:26Z,"here we go..

http://forums.gametrailers.com/showpost.php?p=2480964&postcount=44

if you figure to put the direct link without ERROR.. just tell me how..
Enjoy"
,EvilCreature,2007-05-29T00:42Z,"Yeah I'm trying out mods for the game. So far I've added the Xbox 360 Action Buttons, since I have an Xbox 360 controller for my PC, The Hi-res Handgun with scope, and High-Res enhanced hair for Leon and Ada."
,EvilCreature,2007-05-29T02:56Z,"I see it's been downloaded two times, according to the ""Downloaded"" thing above, yet no more seeders are jumping in.

People please seed, and contribute a little. I can't keep this upload running non-stop as I don't have the bandwidth to keep doing so.

If you can seed, please do it. Thank You.

Another note:

According to some people, the USA release of Resident Evil 4 PC seems to be almost identical to the EU release except the USA retail version is Pre-Patched and has the necessary changes for the American Release. I don't Know if the EU release came in multiple CD's or a DVD, but the American release comes in DVD format and thus the Image of it is a DVD image."
,kutcher,2007-05-29T06:51Z,"There must be something wrong..
However, check your uploaded column.. and tell me what is the no. ??
Also, if you are using Super Seeding from the start it should be around 900 mb..
or it 'll be a little higher if you enabled the option just yesterday..
Anyway, Availability NOW: 26.9%"
,EvilCreature,2007-05-29T08:16Z,"I'm going by what it is saying on this website (TPB), under the torrent name on the right hand side.

It is now saying, ""Downloaded 4 times"" And now there is 3 seeders.

I can't upload anymore tonight. I'll resume uploading tomorrow when my bandwidth and internet are back to normal."
,salsicha_2000,2007-05-30T05:25Z,"EvilCreature, could u please tell us where u got the crack and the serial? gamecopyworld only has the Euro crack. Just tell us the web site or how to search! Thank you!"
,novem212005,2007-05-30T12:45Z,This is rediculous downloaded 5 times and no additional seeders. Greedy bastards! I think I'm just gonna pay the fuckin $20 and buy it.
,EvilCreature,2007-05-30T17:34Z,"I don't know where to get the crack or CD-Key. This torrent is off of my original disks, and I don't want to give out my actual CD-Key for Obvious reasons (Don't want to invalidate my copy).

The EU crack might work, seeing as how the US version is quite similar to the EU version except the US version was pre-patched prior to release.

And people, com'on Please seed a little, and stop being a complete leach. I'm the one who is sharing this and allowing you to get it for nothing. The least you can do is to seed for a while so other people can get it, since I don't have the bandwidth to keep seeding it myself non-stop."
,d.a.r.k.b.o.i,2007-05-30T18:15Z,You can take a guess from the name who I am =P
,EvilCreature,2007-05-30T18:45Z,"""You can take a guess from the name who I am =P""

lemme take a guess, Mogster the Moogleboi?? :D"
,salsicha_2000,2007-05-30T18:54Z,This RE4 is possible to play with the mouse without the mouseaim patch? =D
,EvilCreature,2007-05-30T19:01Z,"""This RE4 is possible to play with the mouse without the mouse aim patch? =D""

No, none of them are. You'll need to download the Mouse Aim patch separately and install it yourself."
,EvilCreature,2007-06-01T04:30Z,"God Fucking damnit! From what I've been seeing in comparison between the Patched RE4 and Unpatched, it seems they also failed to patch the USA version before release.

This does look more terrible without the patch. I was under the frickin' impression that the American Version was Patched before release.

And guess what? I can't find a patch for the American version, only for the EU and Taiwan Versions.  

I'm so pissed now, because I believed this would be patched before release, which now it is apparently not after I cycled through People's comparisons of the Unpatched and Patched version.

I sure hope I can use the EU patch to fix this. 

Sorry for wasting your time people, I truly thought this was pre-patched  before it was released. I guess I was wrong :("
,ricky006,2007-06-01T12:53Z,so who told you it was pre patched ? so ur saying we might as well download the euro versions with more seeds ? and patch it up our selfs ? 
,novem212005,2007-06-01T14:58Z,Can somone give a link to the EU version of this game?
,EvilCreature,2007-06-01T15:13Z,"""so who told you it was pre patched ? so ur saying we might as well download the euro versions with more seeds ? and patch it up our selfs?""

I was under the impression the American release would be Pre-Patched Before release according to what I have heard. Also Wikipedia lists the American version as Pre-Patched Prior to release.

I'm still not exactly sure if My version is Pre-Patched or not. If someone downloaded this and can confirm if it's already patched I'd appreciate it because I can not tell if it is or not.

All is I'm going by is some comparison screenshots someone posted on another forum, so I'm not really exactly sure what to look for.

Also someone said in another forum, but I'm not sure if it's true or not, that they (Ubisoft) Also failed to patch this version before release. 

Again I'm not sure if that's true or not.

I am pretty sure this was the USA American release, because on the back of the case it gives an address and reference to Capcom of America.

Anyone who downloaded this torrent, I would appreciate if you can give feedback on whether this was Pre-Patched. I honestly can't tell as I don't really know what to look for and am going by comparison screenshots.

Thank You if You can confirm this."
,novem212005,2007-06-03T03:35Z,"Ok I could never download this so I went ahead and bought the game (only 20@bucks ebgames), does any one know if the cutscene patch works with the US retail version."
,reza_17173,2007-06-03T11:33Z,"i have some question about it. is it realy north american version that released in 17th may 2007?? because ubisoft promised in RE 4 (usa version) we can play with mouse. but u said that it's not supported mouse.
i have another ask. can anyone tell me about quality demo of this version?? because in other version's movies had bad quality even with patch. patch only changed quality of game play and dont have efficacy of demo.
my english was not good;) but if anyone can understand what i was talking plz give me my some answer:)"
,EvilCreature,2007-06-04T18:13Z,"Yes I found out, from a couple people I chat with on a forum after I posted Screenshots, that they confirmed this is the one hundred percent Genuine Pre-Patched North American Version Released on May 17th, Also I saw the game when I visited Gamestop, and my Box art is the same as the NA version being sold in Gamestop.

As for the mouse aim, it was never implemented before release, and probably never will by Ubisoft or Capcom. It requires the third party mouse aim mod in order to use the mouse.

For the cutscenes, there was a project by Sp00kyFox, where he ripped the PS2 cutscenes, and enhanced them with filters and Anti-Aliasing for the PC Version.

Also people, please seed the damn file for a while and stop just being a bunch of freeloading leechers. Please contribute a little, it's the least you can do for getting something for free.

Part of the problem of the message getting across about seeding, is that this torrent is listed and available from other torrent websites, trackers, searchers, and not everyone that is downloading, is getting the message about seeding the file."
,jongen,2007-06-04T20:04Z,"Hi! I need help. X__X


I have managed to fully install the game by mounting it to Daemon?s, but, after I put the cracked Game.exe into the game?s Dir, and try to start RE4, I get an error message from windows saying ""an error has in file Game.exe and the program has to end"" It?s one of those messages that let you send an error report to windows, just to clarify it any better.


Well... I uninstall it all, try again, but without the crack Game.exe, and... it tells me that I have emulation software running and it can?t start. (no surprise there)


So... I can't run it with the crack, I can't run it without the crack. 


I also tried burning it to a disc with Alcohol 120% and making a VCD Image of it to try and run it that way. Alas... It tells me to insert the original disc and not a backup. And once I try to use the cracked Game.exe with these files/burned disc?s. But.... Nothing different. 


And I know it's not the file, because 2 of my friends were able to install the game and play it on their computers using the same files I have. 


Any thoughts... anyone? Pretty Please?


(Oh, and thank-you CLEXT for getting this game onto the net almost 3 months before it's release in the states. I tip my hat to you)"
,reza_17173,2007-06-04T22:47Z,"Thank you very much my friend(EvilCreature) ;)
so can u give me a link of your screenshots? plz take some photo of your game and upload that screenshots in any site and then give me link of them.
i need your screenshots. i need them for convince some people in around me. they must believe that is realy american north version:)
i'll wait for you.

ooo i forget something. is it realy per demo of this version have better quality than EA version?? are them just like ps2 demo?
i know my english is bad:) im sorry. but plz give me answer. thanks:)"
,EvilCreature,2007-06-04T22:57Z,"I would upload screenshots and post a link, only one problem:

I have no clue how to post links on The Pirate Bay. Everytime I try I get a database error.

I'm pretty sure this is pre-patched, it was even announced that the American Version would ship Pre-Patched after the outrage with the unpatched EU and Taiwan version. If I find out otherwise, I am seriously going to be pissed and write a nice letter/email to Ubisoft/Capcom or post in their forum about the subject.

As soon as I can figure out how to post links on TPB, I upload my screenshots and give a link to the High Res cutscenes. "
,EvilCreature,2007-06-04T23:02Z,"@ Jongen:

Try finding another Crack. You'll need the crack to get past the CD-KEy/Activation. You could ask your friends how they got theirs working.

If you have a serial already, without no crack, you will have to use Yasu (Available on the D-Tools website) to be able to start the game up.

It will still get ""Emulator Detected Error"", but after a few tries it should successfully start up and get ingame."
,reza_17173,2007-06-04T23:30Z,"Thanks Evilcreature for your preamble.

is there any one here that could pass 33.5 ??
plz give me answer..."
,EvilCreature,2007-06-07T16:00Z,"It's stuck there because most people are freeloading leeches, and won't contribute by seeding the file for a while and want everything free while not giving back to the community in which they were provided the game/software for free.

I just don't have the bandwidth to keep seeding the file non-stop, and no one else is getting the point about seeding the file although I keep posting here asking them about seeding it.

The Game/File is 100% Legit, but no one is willing to seed it, thus is why people are having problems downloading it."
,reza_17173,2007-06-07T17:34Z,"so what we gonna do?? now can i pass upshot 33.5% ? is it possible? or better to delete it?

can u send by post your cd game for me;) then i'll promise seed it for other guys;);) ok im kidding.
Apparently we have not choice:( we can't play american version:("
,leo620,2007-06-07T17:42Z,"EvilCreature, please let us know beforehand(say 2, 3 days) when you're going to seed by posting here. Thank you, take care.

I've said it over and over and over in an endless loop, and yet no one else will seed.

I'm considerate enough to share this copy, the least you could do that downloaded it is to contribute and seed the damn thing for a while instead of being a bunch of fucking freeloading leechers who expect everything handed to them freely without contributing or giving back to the community in which you obtained said material for free.
