This is Resident Evil 4 for the PC (Windows 2000/XP/Vista).

This is the Fully Pre-Patched USA Version

This game will run on Vista with minimal errors/annoyances.

No Crack or CD-Key is included with these files, you are on your own for that. I was gracious enough to share my game, but you will have to do some work on your end to play it.

The DVD-Image is in Mds/Mdf format and requires the Latest Version of Daemon-Tools or Alcohol 120%/52% and Yasu (Yet another Securom Utility) to get past the Copy-Protection Blacklist. Do not fret if you get an "Emulator Detected" error upon startup, as this game uses a recent version of the Securom Copy Protection. If you play with it a little and keep clicking the Shortcut or exe to start the game, it will finally start after a few tries or so.

Read the included Readme.txt for Required Specs, and if you have a problem leave a message here about the torrent.

I'll try to upload as much as I can, but to to limitations with my ISP it makes it extremely difficult for me to upload a lot at a time. Just be patient as this game is the real deal legit USA Retail Release.
