,_theo_,2009-01-31T04:41Z,"to play them you can use VCL (video lan) OR you can convert them to and ISO with DVD Shrink and then burn the ISO to disc with imgburn or dvd decrypter (both are freeware). An ISO is a imiage file...an exact (raw) copy of the original disc or file. 
After you burn them you can watch on PC or TV. These are NTSC region 1. 
GREAT story. Loved this! Great video quality. 

A MUST-HAVE !!!!! Don't forget teh second dvd... DVD 2 completes the series. 

Thank you panpa !!!"

,NosTraDomus,2009-09-24T19:48Z,"this is a Retail DVD, as such there was a bug..a glitch in the making of the dvd by LIONGATE.
""The initial Region-1 release of the DVD set is flawed; the menus do not always display correctly, the previews of other Lionsgate attractions cannot be skipped (fast-forward and skip buttons are disabled), subtitles appear to be turned on by default in each program set (meaning that even if the viewer uses their DVD player's menu to turn them off, they will reappear whenever the disc jumps from one episode to the next), and the ""play all"" button does not work as expected.[3] It is not known if Lionsgate intends to fix these issues in subsequent releases.""

for a whole list of objects, there are around 100-but in this MINI series which is 6 episodes, you get to see about a hand full of them..but you can see the WHOLE list at this link,
