,robbo86,2008-07-09T11:00Z,Thanks for this it works fine.Looked around on the net for ages to find a workable program that you do not have to buy. I downloaded a free version only to find after installing it will only convert 50% of the file unless you buy the complete program.I just converted an m4a file to mp3 in seconds.Great
