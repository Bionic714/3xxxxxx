,stiffarm,2007-05-24T08:11Z,"This torrent appears to be a dud? I have had serious problems with episodes 4,5 & 7. When i use unrar on my mac, the decompressed file comes out as a blank green screen avi? I have tried several times to get 4,5 & 7 but all are 350mg duds? Does any one know if I am using the wrong software to decompress or if there are just a pile of duds in circulation? ... anyone help?"
,stiffarm,2007-05-25T09:04Z,Nice one cheesebucket!? Does anyone else have any thing useful to contribute?.... Has anyone else been having hassels with the last couple episodes?
,mikemn,2007-05-27T00:49Z,no they have been top notch try updating your decompression program
,mrvidder,2007-06-22T13:10Z,"had problems with the above mentioned torrents on a mac using quicktime as the player. make sure to use vlc as your player - worked fine for me on 'em...

gotta love a mac. no problems with cheesebucket's main call, just wondering why we should give a crap about Jessica Simpson? Heh-Heh..."
