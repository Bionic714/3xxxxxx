,irontowngeek,2007-05-28T02:00Z,"No problemo on a key for this puppy.

This is a ""generic"" key that will work for XP and
I think it works for Windows 2003 Server.
(can't remember for sure.)

HCQ9D-TVCWX-X9QRG-J4B2Y-GR2TT

If this key does not work on install,
replace TVCWX with 7VCWX.
Can't read my writin' on my CD case.

Nice to have,NO Key-gens."

,Loser1979,2007-06-01T20:54Z,"The keys mentioned here are still valid up to this moment, for unknown reason, Microsoft did not block these keys. They were being used on millions PC in China since 2005 and WGA treated them as genuine keys, 100% perfect. There are people reported these keys to Microsoft numerous time in the last two years but Microsoft did nothing.

Here are the keys (for Windows XP Professional SP2 Volume License Edition of any langauge)

When i burn it into a disk the setup.exe doesnt stay as an exe instead it turns into a file, I've tried both powerISO and alcohol 120% but with no luck, I've tried burning the cd at the slowest speed possible but with no luck."
,Rabiah596,2007-06-03T09:41Z,"Forgot to mention, but when i open the ISO the setup.exe is just fine and it only changes the moment i put it on a cd"

,tops.c,2008-02-22T05:34Z,"It's weird I burned a Win 2000 Pro ISO with Roxio v9.1 and the CD installed after I copied it the file was CDFS on the CD I can't find out how that ISO file converted and the copies of XP Pro won't , this Vista, I think that CD disk that I burned the Win 2000 Pro ISO was formated by a XP sys, it was a old CD-R, Partition Magic 8 wont work with Vista, the Vista will only create a NTFS partition so I can't install XP Pro, any ideas ?

,tops.c,2008-03-01T03:24Z,"Problem ATTN: ""wacko506"", I just purchased a notebook with pre-installed Vista, with this great torrent I tryed a dual boot option, system crashed, the main problem is-->3)NVIDIA nForce Chipset Driver and Network Controller:

ftp://ftp.hp.com/pub/softpaq/sp33001-33500/sp33411.exe

This is the only driver that will work, it must be installed via 'safe mode' your torrent at that window asks for a Administrator password (i.e. A Kung Fu Guy) and the one I set up, the Kung Fu Guy's password is different without it I can't use the above mentioned NVIDIA nForce Chipset Driver and Network Controller, funny HP said XP could not run on this system, found all the other drivers for this notebook just this one problem, I need the PS the Kung Fu Guy used, if you know it PLEASE POST IT , again great torrent :-)"
