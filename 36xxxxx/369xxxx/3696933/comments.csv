They speak RUSSIAN.
The text is ENGLISH

No other options than that... 

Now you know."
,Midi-Me,2007-06-17T21:18Z,"I've been looking for this everywhere.

Please, please keep on site and I promise I will seed it!

Many thanks."
[T],FaeGiN,2007-08-10T16:40Z,Wow thanks.  I already downloaded an avi of this but would like this one better.  Cheers!
,gahack,2007-08-29T17:35Z,Thank you sir!
,brydland,2007-10-23T01:41Z,"Remember i saw this movie, it must have been in the late eighties, and I have been looking for it since then. Extremely good! Hits you in another way than Private Ryan/ Schindlers list ect. does. 

Highly recomendable!!!!!"
,FluffyDragon,2007-11-06T13:10Z,Subtitles are hard of soft? e.g. you can choose just russian language without english subtitles?
,Raul_Anakin,2007-11-21T19:55Z,"Im not 100% sure. You should be able to choose. I dont remember, but subs are rarely hard on a dvd you buy from a store. But like I said, not sure."
,tonyf69,2007-12-10T04:21Z,I saw this movie several years ago and it left a deep impression on me. I didn't know it's title but have just found it here after about 15 years of searching. I can't thank you enough for posting this. Please seed and when complete I promise to seed for as long as possible.
,Kottkvarn,2008-01-20T19:32Z,Whoa total opposite of feel good movie. Good to watch after having seen to many movies with german main characters.
,malanzirotti,2008-04-19T19:40Z,"Raul: what kind of file is this? When I started downloading it with Azureus downloading software, I noticed it was a ""non recognizable file type"" that would not be  directly recognized and played by the VLC software. So, I got discouraged.  What software does one need to play it?  Thanks. "
,jengiscan,2008-05-26T12:42Z,"Can some one give me some advice please...
I keep getting a disk not big enough to download this particular file, I have plenty of room on the hard drive.
I think its something to do with the maximum file size my system will download in one go, any way around this or am I limited to a maximum file size download?"
,pryll,2008-05-27T18:59Z,"probably it is that you have FAT32 or something. Take a look here: http://www.ntfs.com/ntfs_vs_fat.htm

You can convert it to NTFS, if you have xp you can take a look here: http://kadaitcha.cx/ntfs.html

of course check out microsofts webpage if youre on pc. I dont know much about it myself but you can google - lots of info out there"
,pryll,2008-05-27T19:03Z,"By the way - fantastic upload, maybe the most feel-badmovie IÂ´ve ever seen. Never been in a war myself (except with my wife) but I imagine this movie comes close to the real thing."
,gerry310184,2008-07-17T19:08Z,I downloaded this movie yesterday. Every time i try to open the file my computer tries to burn a copy of the movie for me. What is the problem here? Could it be that the file is too big?
,Raul_Anakin,2008-08-01T03:13Z,"Get a program called Magic Disc (bundles with magic iso) and then you just right-click the iso-file and choose to mount it. It works like a virtual dvd-player. 
Or else, just burn it with Nero and watch it."
[T],minOdroL,2008-09-20T16:24Z,"Thanks alot, looks interesting!

Thumbs up for uploading this :)"
[T],glasofwine,2008-11-10T09:16Z,"Was just about to UL this, but it's in here already, great. This just happened to be the greatest movie l've ever seen. Does anyone happened to have other Klimov-movies? Those are, l've seen one in tv."
,malanzirotti,2009-01-02T03:52Z,"Klimov's Come and See is film making at its best, a rare masterpiece.  Thank you, Raul. Film lovers, I recommend that you download The Ascent by the Russian director Larisa Shepitko, Klimov's wife.  It is a superlative WWII film too."
,Porphyrogen71,2009-01-15T14:26Z,"thank you, this is great !"
,extrsurf,2009-02-11T18:23Z,"Yes this is best war movie ever, very terrifying
Thanks!"
,erik5263,2009-04-21T01:50Z,Thank you for great movie! I saw it in eighties when it came out and I remember it was shocking then even in Estonia where I live. We were part of the USSR then and I have seen many WW II movies before made by russians but it is definitely the best of them because of the fresh and different and honest point of view to the war itself. Highly recommended to everybody. War is terrible event.
,cosmos79,2009-08-28T08:46Z,Fantastic upload! Gracias Raul.
,larsral,2009-09-21T16:47Z,"Thanx!
Any advice on where I could buy this movie? This is one of the best movies ever made."
,fredfan,2011-02-15T00:18Z,"Looks like 4:3 aspect ratio.  Original language stereo soundtrack only with hard coded English subtitles.  Seems good, but I haven't yet watched it.  Thanks."
[T],lopow,2012-07-31T05:40Z,"After seeing this movie, I firmly believe that Hollywood, with its crappy and pathetic war movies, should be disbanded.  "
