,xpoetc,2007-05-22T21:39Z,"Does somebody have a key for this version?
I need it terribly."
,Zoracic,2007-05-23T09:23Z,"I did actually get it to work. So I'm sorry if boorstar thought I was being smart :-)

I use the 2nd last key on the list.

Make sure you don't have a connection to the internet and paste it in.

If you have already tried a key and failed then run a cleaner to remove all the files left once you uninstall www.ccleaner.com -ready to do a fresh install."
