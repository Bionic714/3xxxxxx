My Favorite Jeans

Yesterday i received this unreleased electro/indipop album \"My Favorite Jeans\". (by the band My Favorite Jeans.)

Dont know if there is more songs in the album but this is what i got. 
I think that this band is going to be rather big, they have a cute Swedish accent and their own special sound.

Hope you like it as much as i do.


:INFO:
The songs are in mp3 
196 kbit/s
