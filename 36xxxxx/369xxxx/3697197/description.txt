Overview:	A pacifist village is beset by bandits in this martial arts thriller. "Savage Five" hands-down rivals the ornateness of "Kid With The Golden Arm" and the twist-heavy "Five Deadly Venoms". The always great David Chiang plays a lesser version of his Rover character from "Duel Of The Iron Fist", and Ti Lung, looking incredible here, is at his physical best. Accolades to Chen Kuan Tai and Wang Chung in great sympathetic roles, too. A kung fu classic where the actual martial arts display takes a back seat to the mesmerizing story.

Cast: 	David Chiang  ||  Ti Lung  ||  Chen Kuan Tai  ||  Danny Lee Sau-Yin  ||  Wong Chung (Wang Chung)  ||  Wai Wang (Frankie Wei)  ||  Wang Ping-Ping  ||  Lu Ti (Lo Dik)  ||  Kong Do (Chiang Tao)  ||  Wong Ching (Wang Ching)
