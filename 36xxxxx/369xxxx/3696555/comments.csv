1. some car paintjobs dont show up. michael shumacher is a white car.

2. the in race display shows up as white boxes. it is missing.

i wonder if the files are in the data 1 and data 2 winrar files of the game folder. they wont open. says the archieve is either an unknown format or damaged"
,TheEgg,2007-06-12T14:45Z,"NEVERMIND. problem SOLVED !!!

just apply the patch! "
,Rick{NL},2007-06-21T17:02Z,"Hey where can I find that Patch, is it in download or somewhere else?"
,Rick{NL},2007-06-21T18:40Z,I ment where I can find the patch... 
,TheEgg,2007-06-22T15:00Z,racesimulations.com has the patch.
,Rick{NL},2007-06-22T18:59Z,"but then there is one problem, when I want to install the patch it says that I haven't installed GP4, could someone mail me that patch to rick_1991@hotmail.com"
,TheEgg,2007-06-25T06:16Z,testing
,TheEgg,2007-06-25T06:17Z,"you're right. i get that too. i never actually installed the patch with THIS game. he says its patched. it is definitly not patched!

this game wont let you patch it because its not installed. so i dont know what to do. 

i downloaded this game by searching Grand Prix 4 with Ares. there is no torrent though. perhaps i or someone else can make one. because the game i downloaded was much better. it was a .BIN and .CUE file."
,marcusn,2007-07-01T03:13Z,"all the Grand Prix games crashes on my computer (P4 3.0 GHz). the patch doesn't solve it... still bugs, graphics problems."

including the older ones, or just the newest?
