,frogalot,2008-03-02T19:02Z,"btw Guys and Gals, as coretorrents says, this is the 2007 film, not the 2008 which you may be expecting........."
,Moshulu,2008-03-10T14:57Z,"Audio 7/10
Video 6/10

film 2/10 by far the worst thing I have seen in the last month or so. Poor acting, poor directing, and extreamly poor storyline. Not worth to piss on.

And btw, as you might have noticed its NOT THE ONE WITH JASON STATHAM from 2008"
,ramos13192,2008-03-13T08:27Z,not the 2008 bank job..but good quality upload it was just a cheap movie..
,mikey90,2008-03-18T13:47Z,Why fool downloaders with this shit?! It´s not The Bank Job it´s an amateur film about some kind of robbery. These kind of seeders should be hang! Why do you do this kind of things here coretorrents?!

[T],WoC,2008-03-24T21:01Z,"Do not confuse this pile of rubbish with Roger Donaldson's ""The Bank Job"" (2008)!"
,SquidlyDiddly,2008-03-27T13:24Z,Do not Download IT IS SHIT
,Mippo123,2008-03-29T16:57Z,"boycutt: you didn't even read Dr_Krank's post, did you? Or you just didn't understand it. 

mikey90: just because you was fooled doesn't mean that was the purpose. No one claim this to be the Jason Statham movie from 2008. Read before you download and think before you comment. (There is even a link to the page on imdb. sigh.)"
,ynnyytty2,2008-03-31T08:20Z,This kind of shit is th?
