                       Description
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This week Brian looks at the uncertainty over U.S. President George W. Bush's 
Iraq policy. Brian talks to the CBC's Washington Correspondent Neil Macdonald 
about how Bush's Iraq agenda unraveled and what may happen next.

The Iraq military campaign and the "war on terror" that followed 9/11 have 
raised many questions about moral boundaries in war. Brian talks with veteran 
journalist Roy Gutman, the former European Bureau Chief for the US publication, 
NEWSDAY. Gutman won a Pulitzer Prize in 1993 for his reports on Serb atrocities 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Gutman is now chairman of the Crimes of War Project, an 
initiative to help journalists and the public understand the international law 
that combatants are meant to respect in military conflicts. As Gutman explains, 
international laws and the Geneva Conventions are too often ignored. A century 
ago almost all of those killed in warfare were soldiers -- today 90 percent of 
those who die are civilians, mostly women and children. We've seen in armed 
conflicts in the Balkans, Iraq, Lebanon, and Afghanistan that war is full of 
gray areas; prompting the questions: How is terror ever justifiable as a 
weapon?  Should armies fire on insurgents hiding among civilians?  How are 
prisoners to be handled?
