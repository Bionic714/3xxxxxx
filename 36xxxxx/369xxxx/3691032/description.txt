In this programme, Dick met Matt, who has a heavenly New Forest 
house by the beach, but a hellish heating bill. He had a solution, 
but a visit from Dick led to a change of plan. 

In Staffordshire, we met Maggie again. Having moved into her 
eco-decorated house, she wanted a wildlife pond in the garden. Dick, 
Jim and James assisted.

Niel and ZoÃ« live in the Yorkshire Dales. They wanted to be 
self-sufficient with food, so they took on a large allotment, but it 
was a neglected wilderness. James turned it into a neat eco-garden.
