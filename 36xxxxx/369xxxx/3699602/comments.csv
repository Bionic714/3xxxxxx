,philpirate,2007-11-01T10:59Z,Sorry but I don't understand... ALL the vesions of IMTOO on here have the same problem... when you un-RAR they say they need a sepcific file to work...and so will not unpack... any ideas?
,philpirate,2007-11-01T11:03Z,BUT... you can download the unregistered version of the prog from the makers and use the keycode and user name in this pack to register - and then it works fully... yippeeee   thanks
