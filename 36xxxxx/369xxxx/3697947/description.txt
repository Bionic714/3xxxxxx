AMERICAN IDOL SEASON 6 - THE STUDIO RECORDINGS

During the final 12 weeks of the competition, AmericanIdol.com BRIEFLY offered the full versions of the contestants' songs on their website. These are not the "Live Performances" that were ripped from the video. They are High-Quality, In-Studio recordings without the added noise and stress of an audience.

Oddly, all but 10 of these 77 songs are gone from their website!

Fortunately, with thanks to the members of the ED2K, Gnutella, Gnutella2 networks, I was able to find 85 percent of them. Thanks to a music blogger named "Matt," a message board dedicated to Gina Glocksen, and some fans of Sanjaya Malakar, here are the entire 77 songs!

This collection includes a studio version of the Final song -- This is My Now -- sung by the American Idol, Jordon Sparks. And, as a bonus track, Carrie Underwood's song "I'll Stand By You" was added.

78 tracks - 4 hours and 16 minutes of the favorite American Idol contestants!
